    "main_text": "General Issues\n1. General Issues\n\nSocial norms, like many other social phenomena, are the unplanned\nresult of individuals\u2019 interaction. It has been argued that\nsocial norms ought to be understood as a kind of grammar of social\ninteractions. Like a grammar, a system of norms specifies what is\nacceptable and what is not in a society or group. And, analogously to\na grammar, it is not the product of human design. This view suggests\nthat a study of the conditions under which norms come into\nbeing\u2014as opposed to one stressing the functions fulfilled by\nsocial norms\u2014is important to understand the differences between\nsocial norms and other types of injunction (such as hypothetical\nimperatives, moral codes, or legal rules).\n\nAnother important issue often blurred in the literature on norms is\nthe relationship between normative beliefs and behavior. Some authors\nidentify norms with observable, recurrent patterns of behavior. Others\nonly focus on normative beliefs and expectations. Such accounts find\nit difficult to explain the complexity and heterogeneity of\nnorm-driven behaviors, as they offer an explanation of conformity that\nis at best partial.\n\nSome popular accounts of why social norms exist are the following.\nNorms are efficient means to achieve social welfare (Arrow 1971;\nAkerlof 1976), prevent market failures (Jules Coleman 1989), or cut\nsocial costs (Thibaut & Kelley 1959; Homans 1961); norms are\neither Nash equilibria of coordination games or cooperative equilibria\nof prisoner\u2019s dilemma-type games (Lewis 1969; Ullmann-Margalit\n1977), and as such they solve collective action problems.\n\nAkerlof\u2019s (1976) analysis of the norms that regulate land\nsystems is a good example of the tenet that \u201cnorms are efficient\nmeans to achieve social welfare\u201d. Since the worker is much\npoorer and less liquid than the landlord, it would be more natural for\nthe landlord rather than the tenant to bear the risk of crop failure.\nThis would be the case if the landlord kept all the crops, and paid\nthe worker a wage (i.e., the case of a \u201cwage system\u201d).\nSince the wage would not directly depend on the worker\u2019s effort,\nthis system leaves no incentive to the worker for any effort beyond\nthe minimum necessary. In sharecropping, on the contrary, the worker\nis paid both for the effort and the time he puts in: a more efficient\narrangement in that it increases production.\n\nThibaut and Kelley\u2019s (1959) view of norms as substitutes for\ninformal influence has a similar functionalist flavor. As an example,\nthey consider a repeated battle of the sexes game. In this game, some\nbargaining is necessary for each party to obtain, at least\noccasionally, the preferred outcome. The parties can engage in a\ncostly sequence of threats and promises, but it seems better to agree\nbeforehand on a rule of behavior, such as alternating between the\nrespectively preferred outcomes. Rules emerge because they reduce the\ncosts involved in face-to-face personal influence.\n\nLikewise, Ullman-Margalit (1977) uses game theory to show that norms\nsolve collective action problems, such as prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma-type situations; in her own words, \u201c\u2026 a norm\nsolving the problem inherent in a situation of this type is generated\nby it\u201d (1977: 22). In a collective action problem, self-centered\nrational choices produce a Pareto-inefficient outcome.\nPareto-efficiency is restored by means of norms backed by sanctions.\nJames Coleman (1990), too, believes that norms emerge in situations in\nwhich there are externalities, that is, in all those cases in which an\nactivity produces negative (positive) effects on other parties,\nwithout this being reflected in direct compensation; thus the producer\nof the externality pays no cost for (reaps no benefit from) the\nunintended effect of their activity. A norm solves the problem by\nregulating the externality-producing activity, introducing a system of\nsanctions (rewards).\n\nAlso Brennan, Eriksson, Goodin, and Southwood (2013) argue that norms\nhave a function. Norms function to hold us accountable to each other\nfor adherence to the principles that they cover. This may or may not\ncreate effective coordination over any given principle, but they place\nus in positions where we may praise and blame people for their\nbehaviors and attitudes. This function of accountability, they argue,\ncan help create another role for norms, which is imbuing practices\nwith social meaning. This social meaning arises from the expectations\nthat we can place on each other for compliance, and the fact that\nthose behaviors can come to represent shared values, and even a sense\nof shared identity. This functional role of norms separates it from\nbare social practices or even common sets of desires, as those\nnon-normative behaviors don\u2019t carry with them the social\naccountability that is inherent in norms. The distinctive feature of\nthe Brennan et al. account of norms is the centrality of\naccountability: this feature is what distinguishes norms from other\nsocial practices.\n\nAll of the above are examples of a functionalist explanation\nof norms. Functionalist accounts are sometimes criticized for offering\na post hoc justification for the existence of norms (i.e., the mere\npresence of a norm does not justify inferring that that norm exists to\naccomplish some social function). Indeed, a purely functionalist view\nmay not account for the fact that many social norms are harmful or\ninefficient (e.g., discriminatory norms against women and minorities),\nor are so rigid as to prevent the fine-tuning that would be necessary\nto accommodate new cases. There, one would expect increasing social\npressure to abandon such norms.\n\nAccording to some authors, we can explain the emergence of norms\nwithout any reference to the functions they eventually come to\nperform. Since the norms that are most interesting to study are those\nthat emerge naturally from individuals\u2019 interactions (Schelling\n1978), an important theoretical task is to analyze the conditions\nunder which such norms come into being. Because norms often provide a\nsolution to the problem of maintaining social order\u2014and social\norder requires cooperation\u2014many studies on the emergence and\ndynamics of norms have focused on cooperation. Norms of honesty,\nloyalty, reciprocity and promise-keeping are indeed important to the\nsmooth functioning of social groups. One hypothesis is that such\ncooperative norms emerge in close-knit groups where people have\nongoing interactions with each other (Hardin 1982). Evolutionary game\ntheory provides a useful framework for investigating this hypothesis,\nsince repeated games serve as a simple approximation of life in a\nclose-knit group (Axelrod 1984, 1986; Skyrms 1996; Gintis 2000). In\nrepeated encounters people have an opportunity to learn from each\nother\u2019s behavior, and to secure a pattern of reciprocity that\nminimizes the likelihood of misperception. In this regard, it has been\nargued that the cooperative norms likely to develop in close-knit\ngroups are simple ones (Alexander 2000, 2005, 2007); in fact, delayed\nand disproportionate punishment, as well as belated rewards, are often\ndifficult to understand and hence ineffective. Although norms\noriginate in small, close-knit groups, they often spread well beyond\nthe narrow boundaries of the original group. The challenge thus\nbecomes one of explaining the dynamics of the norm propagation from\nsmall groups to large populations.\n\nIf norms can thrive and spread, they can also die out. A poorly\nunderstood phenomenon is the sudden and unexpected change of\nwell-established patterns of behavior. For example, smoking in\npublic without asking for permission has become unacceptable, and only\na few years ago nobody would have worried about using gender-laden\nlanguage. One would expect inefficient norms (such as discriminatory\nnorms against women and minorities) to disappear more rapidly and with\ngreater frequency than more efficient norms. However, Bicchieri (2016)\npoints out that inefficiency is not a sufficient condition for a\nnorm\u2019s demise. This can be seen by the study of crime and\ncorruption: corruption results in huge social costs, but such\ncosts\u2014even when they take a society to the brink of\ncollapse\u2014are not enough to generate an overhaul of the system.\nMuldoon (2018a, 2018b, 2020) has argued that social norms are a\nchallenging form of social regulation precisely because there is no\nsimple way to intentionally modify a social norm, as one can with a\nlaw or institutional rule. Social norms can even shape one's\nunderstanding of how much agency one has (Muldoon 2017).\n\nAn influential view of norms considers them as clusters of\nself-fulfilling expectations (Schelling 1960), in that some\nexpectations often result in behavior that reinforces them. A related\nview emphasizes the importance of conditional preferences in\nsupporting social norms (Sugden 2000). In particular, according to\nBicchieri\u2019s (2006) account, preferences for conformity to social\nnorms are conditional on \u201cempirical expectations\u201d (i.e.,\nfirst-order beliefs that a certain behavior will be followed) as well\nas \u201cnormative expectations\u201d (i.e., second-order beliefs\nthat a certain behavior ought to be followed). Thus, norm compliance\nresults from the joint presence of a conditional preference for\nconformity and the belief that other people will conform as well as\napprove of conformity.\n\nNote that characterizing norms simply as clusters of expectations\nmight be misleading; similarly, a norm cannot simply be identified\nwith a recurrent behavioral pattern either. If we were to adopt a\npurely behavioral account of norms there would be no way to\ndistinguish shared rules of fairness from, say, the collective morning\nhabit of tooth brushing. After all, such a practice does not depend on\nwhether one expects others to do the same; however, one would not even\ntry to ask for a salary proportionate to one\u2019s education, if one\nexpected compensation to merely follow a seniority rule. In fact,\nthere are behavioral patterns that can only be explained by the\nexistence of norms, even if the behavior prescribed by the norm in\nquestion is currently unobserved. For example, in a study of the Ik\npeople, Turnbull (1972) reported that starved hunters-gatherers tried\nhard to avoid situations where their compliance with norms of\nreciprocity was expected. Thus they would go out of their way not to\nbe in the position of gift-taker, and hunted alone so that they would\nnot be forced to share their prey with anyone else. Much of the\nIk\u2019s behavior could be explained as a way of eluding existing\nreciprocity norms.\n\nThere are many other instances of discrepancies between\nexpectations and behavior. For example, it is remarkable to\nobserve how often people expect others to act selfishly, even when\nthey are prepared to act altruistically themselves (Miller &\nRatner 1996). Studies have shown that people\u2019s willingness to\ngive blood is not altered by monetary incentives, but typically those\nvery people who are willing to donate blood for free expect others to\ndonate blood only in the presence of monetary rewards. Similarly, all\nthe interviewed landlords answered positively to a question about\nwhether they would rent an apartment to an unmarried couple; however,\nthey estimated that only 50% of other landlords would accept unmarried\ncouples as tenants (Dawes 1972). Such cases of pluralistic ignorance\nare rather common; what is puzzling is that people may expect a given\nnorm to be upheld in the face of personal evidence to the contrary\n(Bicchieri & Fukui 1999). Furthermore, there is evidence\nsuggesting that people who donate blood, tip on a foreign trip, give\nmoney to beggars or return a lost wallet often attempt to downplay\ntheir altruistic behavior (by supplying selfish motives that seemingly\nalign their actions with a norm of self-interest; Wuthnow 1991, 77).\n\nIn a nutshell, norms refer to actions over which people have control,\nand are supported by shared expectations about what should or should\nnot be done in different types of social situations. However, norms\ncannot be identified just with observable behavior, nor can they\nmerely be equated with normative beliefs.\n\nThe varying degrees of correlation between normative beliefs and\nactions are an important factor researchers can use to differentiate\namong various types of norms. Such a correlation is also a key element\nto consider when critically assessing competing theories of norms: we\nbegin by surveying the socialized actor theory, the social identity\ntheory, and some early rational choice (cost-benefit) models of\nconformity.\n",
