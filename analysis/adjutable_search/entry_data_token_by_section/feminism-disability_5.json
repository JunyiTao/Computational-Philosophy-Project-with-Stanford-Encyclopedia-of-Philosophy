    "main_text": "Embodiment || Disruptive Embodiment\n5.1 Disruptive Embodiment\n\n\nThe powerfully negative meanings evoked by the prevailing\nconceptualization of disability may overwhelm both the equality of\nopportunity and the moral respect that disabled people's exercise\nof autonomy or independence should command. Thus, even healthy\npeople with disabilities often are stigmatized because their embodied\nmodes of functioning strike others as disruptive, however adeptly\nadaptive and independent these may be. And individuals with\ngenetic vulnerabilities that put them at more than species-typical risk\nfor illness are also at risk of such stigmatization. People who\ntest positive for alleles associated with disease may encounter\ndiscrimination in employment and other areas of civic and commercial\nlife, even though they never become symptomatic (Silvers and Stein\n2003). Feminist and gender studies already have shown that atypical,\nand thereby transgressive, modes of corporeal functioning offer a rich\nresource for developing more adequate concepts of the materiality of\nhuman experience and of our personhood (Clare 1999). Yet, whether\nin illness or in health, the lives of disabled people largely have been\nignored when these concepts are explored, to the detriment of moral and\npolitical philosophy generally.\n\n\nPeople who talk or read with their fingers, walk using their arms\nand hands, categorically recoil from other people's touches, or float\nthrough the day on analgesics that suppress waves of pain, often\ndevelop resilient and innovative approaches to fleshly function.\nFurther, disabled people often are the first to incorporate adaptive\ntechnology into their lives. From machines that write (typewriters were\ninvented to permit blind people to write) to machines that speak\n(computerized speech output was invented to permit blind people to\nread), disabled people have piloted the use of mechanical devices that\nnow are integral to so many lives. Adaptive technology combines with\nfleshly effort to secure their basic capabilities: they hear with\namplifiers, breath with respirators, mobilize in wheelchairs that they\nguard with more concern than the care they give their bodies.\n\n\nA supportive intimacy of machine with flesh thus is a feature of\nmany disabled people's lives, but one that can distance them from the\nnondisabled. Alison Kafer criticizes ecofeminism for assuming that\nauthentic engagements with nature are possible only through purely\nnatural immersion experiences from which use of manufactured\nproducts, including the assistive and prosthetic devices that\ndistinguish some disabled people's embodiment, are banned.\nEcofeminism remains bound by the traditional dualism of human artifice\nversus nature, Kafer argues, in part because of mistakenly equating\nspecies-typical bodies with naturalness. Species-typicality remains a\npresumption of feminism, she says (Kafer 2005). Such a standard\ndisregards or devalues people with disabilities whose functioning\nintegrates their fleshly parts with mechanical components or other\ntechnologies. (See Kafer 2013 for a more general theory that intersects  \nfeminist, disability, and queer theory approached to embodiment.)\n\n\nAlthough ordinarily considered unfit to participate in competitive\nschemes, when disabled people with prostheses function well, their\nsupposed cyborgian advantages create another reason for their\nbeing shunned. In a case that went to the United States Supreme\nCourt, the Professional Golf Association unsuccessfully attempted to\nban an otherwise qualified individual because a physical anomaly\nprevented him from walking for a full eighteen holes. The PGA invoked\nthe specter of a Frankensteinian slippery slope: if an anomalous golfer\ncould mobilize with a golf cart while normal golfers walked, what would\nprevent a future contender, an upper limb amputee, from strapping on a\nbionic arm that can drive a golf ball more than two miles (PGA Tour,\nInc. v. Martin (00-24) 532 U.S. 661 (2001) 204 F. 3d 994)?\n\n\nLower leg amputees used to be excluded from competitive running\nbecause their prostheses made them run too slowly. Now new materials\nand designs have created specially springy sports feet that permit\ntheir wearers, when very skilled and talented, to run as fast as can\nbe done with fleshly feet. A hit-and-run driver's victim, Dory\nSelinger now bicycles with a cleated peg replacing an amputated\nfoot. Because it does not flex, the peg is more efficient at pedaling\nthan a fleshly foot. Selinger's best time is only four seconds off the\nlongstanding world record for \u201cnormal\u201d racers\n(Squatrighlia 2001).\n\n\nThe South African track star Oscar Pistorius, whose congenitally\nanomalous feet were amputated in childhood, uses modern alloy\nartificial feet that return almost as much energy as the runner's\nweight loads. Racing officials opposed Pistorius's competing against\nnondisabled athletes, invoking objections running from fears of his\nfalling on other athletes, through his violating the rules because he\nhas no fleshly foot to touch the starting block, to his very presence\ncorrupting the purity of the sport, and the extravagantly dire\nprediction that able-bodied athletes would amputate their own fleshly\nfeet to gain advantages derived from prosthetics. Pistorius appears to\nuse about one-fourth less lower leg energy when matched with runners\nwith fleshly feet because his prosthetic ankles are more efficient\nthan fleshly ankles, and initially he was banned from the Olympics due\nto the claim (subsequently overturned by the International Court of\nArbitration for Sport) that his artificial feet gave him an unfair\nadvantage. (See Silvers and Wasserman 2000 for a general discussion of\nfairness in regard to accommodating people with disabilities in\ncompetitive sport and Silvers 2008 in regard to enhanced\nembodiment.)\n\n\nArguably, it is unfair to exclude racers with disabilities on the\nground that crude prosthetics render unable to be competitive, and\nthen also to exclude them when better prosthetics make them highly\ncompetitive. Such a practice of limiting eligibility to typically\nembodied competitors narrows social opportunity for whoever does not\nconform to the conventional rules of embodiment. And it is precisely\nbecause of the ease with which such rules of competition can be rigged\nto favor some so-called normal modes of functioning over other\nseemingly anomalous ones that feminists rightly have been suspicious\nof invoking rules derived from models of competitive recreation as\nrelevant to and regulative of social justice.\n\n\nTraditional approaches to justice often take competition for resources\nor position to be fundamental to social and political relationships,\nwhich consequently puts an emphasis on fairly managing socially\nbestowed or artificially achieved advantage, somewhat as the rules of\ngames control the deployment of inside information, equipment,\npharmaceuticals and other such performance enhancers. On the other\nhand, feminist theories of justice achieved through inclusiveness,\nsuch as Iris Young's (1990) and Martha Nussbaum's (2006), cast\ninterdependence rather than rivalry as the social and political\nrelationship with which justice should be more concerned. In contrast\nto traditional justice theory's worries about disruptive embodiment's\nimpact on practice, policy and principle (for example, see Rawls's\nwell-known exclusion of disabled people on this ground, 1985 p. 234),\nsuch feminist theories condemn, and try to overcome, the omission or\ninterdiction from practice, policy and principles of justice of people\nwith anomalous bodies or minds.\n",
