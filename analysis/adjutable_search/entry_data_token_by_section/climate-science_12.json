    "main_text": "Anthropogenic Climate Change || Detection and Attribution\n5.1 Detection and Attribution\n\nThe IPCC defines detection of climate change as \n\n\nthe process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by\nclimate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without\nproviding a reason for that change. (IPCC-glossary: 1452) \n\n\nThey imply that they are interested in climate change due to external\nfactors, rather than natural processes internal to the climate system,\nwhen they add: \n\n\nAn identified change is detected in observations if the likelihood of\noccurrence by chance due to internal variability alone is determined\nto be small, for example <10%. (ibid.) \n\n\nDetection thus requires a statistical estimate of how much a quantity\nor field of interest might fluctuate due to internal variability. It\nis challenging to estimate this from the instrumental record.\nEstimates have been extracted from paleoclimate data for some\nquantities (Schurer et al. 2013) but, as noted in\n Section 4.3,\n often they are obtained from long GCM/ESM simulations in which\nexternal conditions are held constant.\n\nIn its periodic assessments, the IPCC has reached increasingly strong\nconclusions about the detection of climate change in observations. The\nIPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report concluded that it is\n\u201cvirtually certain\u201d (i.e., probability >0.99) that the\nincrease in global mean surface temperature seen since 1950 is not due\nto internal variability alone (Bindoff et al. 2013: 885). That is, the\nprobability that the warming is due to internal variability alone was\nassessed by the scientists, on the basis of available evidence and\nexpert judgment, to be less than\n 1%.[4]\n Indeed, it was noted that, even if internal variability were three\ntimes larger than estimates from simulations, a change would still be\ndetected (ibid.: 881, citing Knutson et al. 2013). Changes have been\nformally detected in many other aspects of the climate system as well,\nnot just in the atmosphere but also in the oceans and the\ncryosphere.\n\nThe process of attribution seeks to identify the cause(s) of\nan observed change in climate. It employs both basic physical\nreasoning\u2014observed changes are qualitatively consistent (or not)\nwith the expected effects of a potential cause\u2014as well as\nquantitative studies. The latter include fingerprint studies, in which\nclimate models are used to simulate what would occur over a period if\na particular causal factor (or set of factors) were changing, while\nother potential causal factors were held constant; the resulting\nsimulated pattern of change in the target variable or\nfield\u2014often a spatiotemporal pattern\u2014is the\n\u201cfingerprint\u201d of that factor (or set of factors).\nScientists then perform a regression-style analysis, looking for the\nlinear combination of the fingerprints that best fits the observations\nand checking whether the residual is statistically consistent with\ninternal variability (see, e.g., Bindoff et al. 2013: Box 10.1). If\nso, then an estimate of the contributions of the different causal\nfactors that were considered can be extracted from the analysis.\nBecause of uncertainties associated with observational data, the\nresponse patterns and various methodological choices, attribution\nstudies produce a range of estimated contributions for each\n factor.[5]\n\nAs with detection, IPCC conclusions related to attribution have grown\nstronger over time and have come to encompass more variables and\nfields. In their Fifth Assessment Report, the IPCC concluded that it\nis \u201cextremely likely\u201d (i.e., probability >0.95) that\nmore than half of the increase in global mean surface temperature\nsince 1950 was due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and other\nanthropogenic forcings (Bindoff et al. 2013: 869). This conclusion was\ninformed by multiple fingerprint studies, as well as physical\nreasoning and expert judgment. The latter underwrite key assumptions\nof the attribution exercise (e.g., that no significant causes have\nbeen overlooked) and, relatedly, play a role in deciding the extent to\nwhich face-value probabilities produced in fingerprint studies should\nbe downgraded (e.g., from \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to\n\u201cextremely likely\u201d) in light of remaining uncertainties\nand recognized limitations of those studies. For various other\nchanges, including increases in global mean sea level since the 1970s\nand retreat of glaciers since the 1960s, the IPCC concludes that it is\nat least \u201clikely\u201d (i.e., probability >0.66) that human\ninfluence played a role (ibid.: 869\u2013871).\n\nThese conclusions about detection and attribution align with, if not\nconstitute, the \u201cconsensus\u201d position regarding the reality\nand causes of recent climate change. The extent to which there is a\nscientific consensus on these matters, however, has itself become a\ntopic of debate. It is often reported, for example, that 97% (or more)\nof climate scientists agree that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse\ngases are causing global climate change (Cook et al. 2016). Analyses\nof the scientific literature, as well as surveys of scientists, have\nbeen conducted to demonstrate (or challenge) the existence of this\nconsensus. This focus on consensus can seem misguided: what matters is\nthat there is good evidence for a scientific claim, not merely that\nsome percentage of scientists endorses it (see also Intemann 2017).\nYet consensus among experts can serve as indirect evidence for a\nscientific claim\u2014an indication that the scientific evidence\nfavors or even strongly supports the claim\u2014at least if the\nconsensus is \u201cproduced in the right manner\u201d (Odenbaugh\n2012). A consensus emerging from a process that gives free rein to\nshared bias or groupthink (Ranalli 2012), or that does not require\nthat those surveyed have relevant expertise, might have little\nevidential value. By contrast, a \u201chard won\u201d\nconsensus\u2014one that emerges despite the reluctance of\nindependent-minded and critical parties, after \u201cvigorous debate\nand a thorough examination of the range of alternative\nexplanations\u201d (ibid.: 187) might be significant; the indirect\nevidence provided by such a consensus could be useful to non-experts\nwho are not able to evaluate the scientific evidence themselves.\nRanalli (2012) suggests that parties on opposite sides of debates\nabout the reality and causes of climate change generally hold similar\nviews about what makes for a reliable scientific consensus, but\ndisagree over the extent to which the climate consensus meets the\nstandard.\n\nIn support of the consensus position regarding detection and\nattribution, Oreskes (2007) argues that research underpinning it\naccords with various models of scientific reliability: it has a strong\ninductive base, it has made nontrivial correct predictions, it has\nsurvived persistent efforts at falsification, it has uncovered a body\nof evidence that is consilient, and\u2014in light of all of\nthis\u2014climate scientists have concluded that the best explanation\nof recent observed warming includes a significant anthropogenic\ncomponent. She also emphasizes that the core idea that increased\natmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide would warm the climate\nemerged first from basic physical understanding, not from computer\nmodels of the climate system. In a complementary analysis, Lloyd\n(2010, 2013) offers a defense of the use of climate models in\nattribution research and argues that studies involving multiple\nclimate models\u2014which incorporate similar assumptions about the\nradiative properties of greenhouse gases but differ somewhat in their\nempirically-supported representations of other climate system\nprocesses\u2014provide enhanced support for the conclusion that\ngreenhouse gases are (part of) a good explanation of observed recent\nwarming; she argues that such studies illustrate a distinctive kind of\nmodel robustness, which incorporates variety-of-evidence\nconsiderations, and that such robustness is a \u201cconfirmatory\nvirtue\u201d (see also Vez\u00e9r 2016b). Robustness and\nvariety-of-evidence considerations are also highlighted by Parker\n(2010), in a different way; she suggests that they have been\nimportant for justifying detection and attribution claims, given that\nformal studies, such as fingerprint studies, often rely on contentious\nor false assumptions. Winsberg (2018: Ch.11&12) critically\nexamines and synthesizes much of this recent work on robustness in\nclimate science, drawing on Schupbach\u2019s (2016) account of\nrobustness analysis as explanatory reasoning.\n\nKatzav (2013b), however, considers another perspective on\nevidence\u2014Mayo\u2019s (1996) severe testing framework\u2014and\nargues that the claim that more than half of the increase in global\nmean surface temperature since 1950 was due to anthropogenic forcing\nhas not passed a severe test in Mayo\u2019s sense, even when\nvariety-of-evidence considerations are factored in; from a severe\ntesting perspective, he contends, we still lack good evidence for this\nconclusion. He suggests that some weaker attribution claims\u2014such\nas the claim that anthropogenic forcing had some role in\npost-1950 warming\u2014might be ones for which there is good evidence\nin Mayo\u2019s demanding sense. \n",
