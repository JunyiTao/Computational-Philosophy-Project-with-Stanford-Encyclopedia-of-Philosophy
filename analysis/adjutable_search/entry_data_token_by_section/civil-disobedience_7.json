    "main_text": "Other Types of Protest || Conscientious Objection\n2.3 Conscientious Objection\n\nConscientious objection may be defined as a refusal to conform to some\nrule, mandate, or legal directive on grounds of personal opposition to\nit. Examples include conscripts refusing to serve in the army; public\nofficials refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses; and parents\nrefusing to vaccinate their children as mandated by state law. Public\nofficials\u2019 conscientious objection is indistinguishable from\nrule departures insofar as the agent refuses to discharge the set of\nduties associated with her official role. Conscientious\nobjectors\u2019 non-conformity may stem from very different kinds of\nmotives: the conscript\u2019s religious pacifism or moral and\npolitical opposition to a particular war or military occupation, for\ninstance, has little in common with anti-vaxxers\u2019\npseudo-scientific beliefs. But, in many views, conscientious objection\nis conscientious in the sense identified above, that is to say,\nsincere, serious, and reflecting the depth of the person\u2019s\nconviction. In other views, however, when an objector seeks to keep\nher act private and to avoid detection, this casts doubt on her\nsincerity and seriousness (Brownlee 2012, ch. 1). As an objection,\nconscientious objection also shares with civil disobedience the\nagent\u2019s opposition to the law, since the conscientious objector\nrefuses to conform with the law because she considers it bad or wrong,\ntotally or in part, and thus seeks to disassociate herself from\nit.\n\nConscientious objection is often considered to be the private\ncounterpart of civil disobedience: where civil disobedients address\nthe public, are motivated by and appeal to general considerations of\njustice, and seek to bring about reform, conscientious objectors are\nsupposed to be animated by personal convictions and to simply seek to\npreserve their own moral integrity through exemption (Smith and\nBrownlee 2017). For instance, consider that the refusal of\nJehovah\u2019s Witnesses to salute the flag is a matter of private\nreligious morality; they do not seek to abolish the practice of\nsaluting the flag for all citizens. Their example is instructive in\nanother way: Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 refusal is legally\nprotected. Conscientious objection, unlike civil disobedience, is not\nnecessarily unlawful. Indeed, the law protects conscientious objectors\nin many contexts, including in the military and healthcare, by carving\nout exemptions for them.\n\nSome thinkers distinguish conscientious objection from conscientious\nevasion and stress that we should not overstate the private and\npersonal characteristics of the former. Conscientious objectors often\nact openly and non-anonymously and take responsibility for their\nnon-conforming act by attempting or being willing to justify it to\nauthorities. To that extent, they may be said to meet the\npublicity-as-visibility requirement. Some agents, in contrast,\nundertake their conscientious objection covertly and evasively as\nconscientious evasion. A young man drafted to fight a war he opposes,\nfor instance, may openly refuse to serve and be arrested and charged\nfor his refusal, or covertly dodge the draft by going AWOL. While\nconscientious evasion is incompatible with the intention to\ncommunicate, conscientious objection may have a public or\ncommunicative component, as Thoreau clearly did with his conscientious\ntax refusal, in a way that blurs the distinction with civil\ndisobedience. Moreover, when such actions are taken by many people\n\u2013 as they often are \u2013 their collective impact can\napproximate the kind of communicative protest exemplified in civil\ndisobedience (Delmas 2018a, ch. 7). In this vein, Emanuela Ceva (2015)\nhighlights the public and political character of conscientious\nobjection (what we call publicity-as-appeal above), which she\nconceives of as \u2018a form of political participation\u2019.\n",
