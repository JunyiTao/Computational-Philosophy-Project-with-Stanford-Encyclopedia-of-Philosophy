    "main_text": "Method and hypothesis\n3. Method and hypothesis\n\nIn his memoirs, Hans-Georg Gadamer calls Natorp, his doctoral\nsupervisor, a \u201cMethodenfanatiker\u201d (Gadamer 1977:\n62). By this Gadamer means that Natorp, for most of his career,\nfocused on the methodical aspect of thinking to the point of reducing\nthinking to method. To understand this riddling statement, one must\ntake into account Natorp\u2019s interpretation of the word,\n\u201cmethod\u201d. He writes:\n\nThe word \u201cmethod\u201d, metienai, implies not a mere\n\u201cgoing\u201d or movement in general; nor, as Hegel believes, a\nmere accompanying [going-with]; rather, method means a going towards a\ngoal, or at any rate in a secured direction: it means\n\u201cgoing-after\u201d\n [pursuit].[18]\n (Natorp 1912c: 199\u2013200)\n\n\nThe directedness towards a goal which Natorp claims is implied by\n\u201cmethod\u201d illuminates one of two\n senses[19]\n in which his philosophy is idealistic, namely that science (and the\nother activities of culture) are guided by regulative ideas or\nlimit-concepts (Grenzbegriffe). Ideas, as Kant argues in the\nTranscendental Dialectic, are a priori concepts whose source\nlies in pure reason alone. Their only legitimate\u2014though\nindispensable\u2014theoretical use is to regulate the\nunderstanding\u2019s cognition of objects: reason sets down the\nconditions under which the understanding\u2019s activity will have\nachieved its ideal completion in the systematic interconnection of its\ncognitions, i.e., in an ultimate science. Reason thereby offers the\nunderstanding a rule\u2014viz. maximal scope and maximal internal\nsystematicity\u2014against which any actually achieved system of\nscience must be measured; and because human finitude makes it\nimpossible in principle for any actual system to attain the ideal\nmaximum, reason also spurs the understanding on towards ever new\ndiscoveries and\n reorganizations.[20]\n\n\nWhile Natorp often seems to blur the distinction between Kantian\ncategories and ideas, collapsing them both into\n\u201chypotheses\u201d (see below), there is one notion that does\nfunction as an ideal: the Ding an sich. According to Natorp,\nthe thing in itself, properly conceived, is a \u201cpure\nlimit-concept [Grenzbegriff], which merely delimits\n[begrenzt] experience in its own creative legislation\u201d\n(Natorp 1912c: 199); more precisely, the thing in itself is not some\nmind-independent X, but rather an X necessarily\nimplied by the fact of scientific progress, namely the\n\u201ccomprehensive sum total [Inbegriff] of scientific\nknowledge\u201d (Natorp 1918a: 19). Because science is an activity of\nreason alone, and the thing in itself is a rational posit necessary\nfor that activity, it is no longer in conflict with the postulate of\nreason\u2019s autonomy. Given an object of scientific cognition, the\ncognition is conceived as a process never \u201cdefinitively\nconcluded\u201d, as Cohen says; rather, \u201cevery true concept is\na new question; none is a final answer\u201d (Cohen 1885, cited at\nNatorp 1918a: 19). Natorp comments: \u201cJust this is the meaning of\nthe thing in itself as X: the infinite task\u201d (Natorp\n1918a: 19). In other words, the thing in itself is the ideal of an\nobject exhaustively determined by concepts, that is, completely known.\nAs with Kant, however, our cognitive finitude means that the process\nof conceptual determination can only approach this ideal\n asymptotically.[21]\n This pursuit of total determination is what Natorp calls\n\u201cmethod\u201d, the pursuit of science.\n\nThis brings us to the key notion of \u201chypothesis\u201d. The\npursuit of science\u2014its \u201cmethod\u201d in Natorp\u2019s\nspecial sense\u2014proceeds by hypothesis. Sometimes he puts it more\npointedly: hypothesis is method. Since method is for him a\n\u201cgoing-after\u201d or pursuit of the \u201cperpetually distant\ngoal\u201d (Natorp 1910c: 97) or focus imaginarius of\ncomplete objective determination, Natorp interprets\n\u201chypothesis\u201d in a correspondingly active sense. He takes\nthe term \u201chypo-thesis\u201d quite literally as a\n\u201csetting-down\u201d or \u201claying-under\u201d, or as he\nputs it, a \u201cGe-setz\u201d or\n\u201cGrund-legung\u201d (cf. Cohen 1902: 449; 1916: 308,\nff.). These glosses all emphasize the activity of hypothesis: it is\nless a posit than a positing, an act by which thinking proceeds and\nbecomes experience. Natorp writes: \n\nThe risk [Wagnis] [of hypothesizing] is inevitable if the\nprocess of experience should begin and continue moving: just as my\nfoot must take a stand if it is to be able to walk. This taking a\nstand is necessary, but the stand must in turn always be left behind.\n(Natorp 1912c: 203)\n\n\nThe act of hypothesis has two\n aspects.[22]\n First, hypothesis as law (Gesetz) or groundwork\n(Grundlegung) is the transcendental foundation for scientific\nexperience, i.e., for the activity of legislating and thus rationally\nunderstanding the phenomena. The \u201cphenomena\u201d in question\nare not however the sensible phenomena of subjective, psychic\nexperience (Erlebnis), but are instead themselves already\nconstructions or interpretations. These constructions in turn are\nfounded on hypotheses of a lower order, viz. on specific concepts\nformulated to transmute particular subjective experiences into\nobjective knowledge. To take up our earlier example, when the\nastronomer speaks of planets and their laws of motion, he is speaking\nobjectively of scientific phenomena, as opposed to\nthe subjective appearance of sensible phenomena to\nyou or me. Therefore, on Natorp\u2019s view, strange as it may sound,\nthe phenomenon \u201cMars\u201d is an hypothesis, an object\ncertainly, but for all that an ideal and never fully determined\nthought-object; moreover, the motion of this object, too, is\nideal: it can be calculated with the utmost exactitude. It is these\ntwo hypotheses\u2014the concept, \u201cMars\u201d, and the laws\ngoverning its motion\u2014that alone are objective, and susceptible\nto knowledge; the reddish speck in the sky is merely a subjective\nappearance, of which there can be no genuine (astronomical)\nscience.\n\nTo pull our strands together, thinking in the strict sense is\nscientific thinking, for it alone is generative of knowledge, i.e.,\nobjective truth. Science (and therefore knowledge) as a matter of fact\nevolves through time: science is a fieri. However, this\nevolution or fieri is not unregulated, but moves in a\ncontinuous pursuit of ever more precise determinations of experience:\nthis pursuit is literally called \u201cmethod\u201d. These\ndeterminations of experience just are the objects of science. The\nphilosophical task therefore is to analyze the condition of\npossibility of the regularity of this methodical\ndetermination of experience. Natorp (like Cohen; 1902: 449) identifies\nthis condition as hypothesis, interpreted as law (Ge-setz,\nposit); experience in the strict sense is only possible given a law\n(Gesetz) that functions as its interpretational groundwork or\nfoundation (Grundlegung). The first hypothesis or primal\nposit then must be the law of lawfulness, viz., the rational postulate\nthat experience, in order to be Erfahrung, and not mere\nErlebnis, must accord with law, i.e., be grounded on a\nrational foundation (cf. Natorp 1887: 285; 1911e; 1917: 246). This\ncategorical imperative, that all its experience fall under law, is the\noriginary act of reason wherein lies its ultimate autonomy; it is the\nregulative principle of the continuous, orderly flow of\n experience.[23]\n As a general, purely formal law it regulates the particular\nhypotheses, which in turn generate or ground particular objects of\nErfahrung (such as \u201cMars\u201d,\n\u201celectricity\u201d, \u201catom\u201d, or\n\u201cgravity\u201d) in the regulated process of their ever wider\nand ever more rigorous determination. How it does this is a\nseparate problem, one that Natorp attempts to solve through his system\nof categories, treated in the next section.\n",
