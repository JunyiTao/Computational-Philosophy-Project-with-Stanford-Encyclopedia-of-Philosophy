    "main_text": "Why Public Reason? || Justice\n1.5 Justice\n\nOn one common view, public reason is a distinctively political idea:\nit paradigmatically applies to the laws and other political\ninstitutions of our society. One way to explain its distinctively\npolitical nature is to ground the idea of public reason in the value\nof justice (Quong 2013; Rawls 1996). On this view we begin with an\nideal of society as a fair system of social cooperation between free\nand equal citizens. As Rawls says, this ideal \u201cprovides a\npublicly recognized point of view from which all citizens can examine\nbefore one another whether their political and social institutions are\njust. It enables them to do this by citing what are publicly\nrecognized among them as valid and sufficient reasons singled out by\nthat conception itself\u2026the aim of justice as fairness, then, is\npractical: it presents itself as a conception of justice that may be\nshared by citizens as a basis of a reasoned, informed, and willing\npolitical agreement. It expresses their shared and public political\nreason\u201d (Rawls 1996, 9). Ensuring that the principles that\nregulate our shared political life can be justified to each citizen by\nreference to this common point of view\u2014showing these principles\ncan be the subject of public reason\u2014is how we can know that the\nterms that regulate our political institutions are fair, and therefore\njust. If our political principles were instead justified by appeal to\nsome reasonably contested moral, philosophical, or religious doctrine,\nthe terms of our public life would not be fair. Public reason, on this\nview, is the only way to achieve justice given certain assumptions\nabout the nature of well-ordered liberal democratic societies. This\nrationale for public reason has several advantages (Quong 2013).\nFirst, it explains the distinctively political focus of public reason.\nSecond, justice is widely agreed to be an important value, arguably\n\u201cthe first virtue of social institutions\u201d (Rawls 1999a,\n1), and thus if public reason is grounded in the value of justice,\nthis would also explain what some take to be an important feature of\npublic reason, namely, that its conclusions ought to have a certain\ndeliberative priority for citizens. Finally, the value of justice can\nbe endorsed by people from diverse religious, moral, and philosophical\nbackgrounds, and so the value of justice can provide a relatively\nuncontentious basis for public reason.\n\nBut this view of the basis of public reason also faces important\nobjections. Some will deny that political principles, even under\nconditions of reasonable pluralism or disagreement, need to be\njustifiable to each (reasonable) citizen in order to be fair or just.\nOthers will object that this account does not provide the real\nfoundation for public reason\u2014it merely shifts the focus to the\nvalue of justice. Unless we can explain the basis for giving justice\nsuch practical importance, we lack an account of the importance of\npublic reason. Others may object, more strongly, that justice cannot\nhave deliberative priority or practical importance when restricted to\nthose principles capable of being the subject of public reason. Some\nof these objections are considered in greater detail in section 7.\n",
