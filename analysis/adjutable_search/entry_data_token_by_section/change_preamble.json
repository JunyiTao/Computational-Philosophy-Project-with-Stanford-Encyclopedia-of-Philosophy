    "main_text": "\n\n\nChange is so pervasive in our lives that it almost defeats\ndescription and analysis. One can think of it in a very general way\nas alteration. But alteration in a thing raises subtle problems. One\nof the most perplexing is the problem of the consistency of change:\nhow can one thing have incompatible properties and yet remain the\nsame thing? Some have held that change is a consistent process, and\nrendered so by the existence of time. Others have held that the only\nway to make sense of change is as an inconsistency. This entry\nsurveys the history of this problem and cognate issues, and concludes\nthat the case for change as inconsistency cannot be dismissed so\neasily.\n",
