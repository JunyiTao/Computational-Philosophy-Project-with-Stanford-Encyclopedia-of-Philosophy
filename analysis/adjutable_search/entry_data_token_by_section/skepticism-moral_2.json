    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Skepticism || Moral Disagreements\n3.1 Moral Disagreements\n\n\nThe simplest and most common argument for moral skepticism is based\non observed facts: Smart and well-meaning people disagree about the\nmoral permissibility of abortion, affirmative action, capital\npunishment, active euthanasia, nuclear deterrence, welfare reform,\ncivil rights, and so on. Many observers generalize to the conclusion\nthat no moral claim is or would be accepted by everyone.\n However, all of these disagreements together still do not exclude\nthe possibility of agreement on other moral beliefs. Maybe nobody\ndenies that it is morally wrong to torture babies just to get sexual\npleasure. Moreover, even if no moral belief is immune to disagreement,\nthe fact that some people disagree with me does not prove that I am\nunjustified in holding my moral belief. I might be able to show them\nthat I am right, or they might agree with me under ideal\ncircumstances, where they are better informed, more thoughtful, less\npartial, and so on. Moral disagreements that are resolvable do not\nsupport moral skepticism, so any argument for moral skepticism from\nmoral disagreement must show that moral disagreements are unresolvable\non every issue. That will require a separate argument. (For further\ndiscussions, see Bergmann & Kain 2014, Besong 2014, and Vavova\n2014.) \n",
