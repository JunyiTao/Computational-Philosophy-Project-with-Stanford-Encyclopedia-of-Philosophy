    "main_text": "The Aims of Statistical Mechanics (SM)\n1. The Aims of Statistical Mechanics (SM)\n\nStatistical Mechanics (SM) is the third pillar of modern physics, next\nto quantum theory and relativity theory. Its aim is to account for the\nmacroscopic behaviour of physical systems in terms of dynamical laws\ngoverning the microscopic constituents of these systems and the\nprobabilistic assumptions made about them. One aspect of that\nbehaviour is the focal point of SM: equilibrium. Much of SM\ninvestigates questions concerning equilibrium, and philosophical\ndiscussions about SM focus on the foundational assumptions that are\nemployed in answers to these questions.\n\nLet us illustrate the core questions concerning equilibrium with a\nstandard example. Consider a gas confined to the left half of a\ncontainer with a dividing wall (see\n Figure 1a).\n The gas is in equilibrium and there is no manifest change in\nany of its macro properties like pressure, temperature, and volume.\nNow you suddenly remove the dividing wall (see\n Figure 1b),\n and, as result, the gas starts spreading through the entire available\nvolume. The gas is now no longer in equilibrium (see\n Figure 1c).\n The spreading of the gas comes to an end when the entire available\nspace is filled evenly (see\n Figure 1d).\n At this point, the gas has reached a new equilibrium. Since the\nprocess of spreading culminates in a new equilibrium, this process is\nan approach to equilibrium. A key characteristic of the\napproach to equilibrium is that it seems to be irreversible:\nsystems move from non-equilibrium to equilibrium, but not vice\nversa; gases spread to fill the container evenly, but they do not\nspontaneously concentrate in the left half of the container. Since an\nirreversible approach to equilibrium is often associated with\nthermodynamics, this is referred to as thermodynamic\nbehaviour. Characterising the state of equilibrium and accounting\nfor why, and how, a system approaches equilibrium is the core task for\nSM. Sometimes these two problems are assigned to separate theories (or\nseparate parts of a larger theory), which are then referred to as\nequilibrium SM and non-equilibrium SM,\nrespectively.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n(d)\n\n\nFigure 1 [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhile equilibrium occupies centre stage, SM of course also deals with\nother issues such as phase transitions, the entropy costs of\ncomputation, and the process of mixing substances, and in\nphilosophical contexts SM has also been employed to shed light on the\nnature of the direction of time, the interpretation of probabilities\nin deterministic theories, the state of the universe shortly after the\nbig bang, and the possibility of knowledge about the past. We will\ntouch on all these below, but in keeping with the centrality of\nequilibrium in SM, the bulk of this entry is concerned with an\nanalysis of the conceptual underpinnings of both equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium SM.\n\nSometimes the aim of SM is said to provide a reduction of the laws of\nthermodynamics: the laws of TD provide a correct description of the\nmacroscopic behaviour of systems and the aim of SM is to account for\nthese laws in microscopic terms. We avoid this way of framing the aims\nof SM. Both the nature of reduction itself, and the question whether\nSM can provide a reduction of TD (in some specifiable sense) are\nmatters of controversy, and we will come back to them in\n Section 7.5.\n",
