    "main_text": "The Structure of Appearance || The Significance of The Structure of Appearance\n4.4 The Significance of The Structure of Appearance\nVery many of the side issues dealt with in A Study of\nQualities and The Structure of Appearance reappear in\nGoodman\u2019s later philosophy. The \u201cgrue\u201d-problem (to be\nexplained in the next section) as a problem of what predicates to use\nfor projection and the related problem of how to analyze disposition\npredicates, as well as the question of how to explicate simplicity,\ntense, aboutness, and so on, all have their roots in Goodman\u2019s\ndissertation. Alas, his most important work is also his most\ncomplicated, which is perhaps the reason why it is so often ignored.\nOther writings by Goodman are seemingly more accessible and have thus\nattracted a wider readership. However, it is arguable that the\nsignificance of Goodman\u2019s \u201ceasier\u201d pieces cannot be\nassessed adequately without relating them to the problems and projects\nof A Study of Qualities and The Structure of\nAppearance.\n",
