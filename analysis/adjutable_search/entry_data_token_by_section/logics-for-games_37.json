    "main_text": "Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games || Further Challenges for a Logical Approach\n5.5 Further Challenges for a Logical Approach\n\nFurther challenges to the interplay of logic and probabilistic\nreasoning abound. By way of conclusion, here is a dimension that seems\nhard to capture in purely qualitative logical terms. A characteristic\nfeature of game- and decision-theoretic reasoning is that beliefs and\npreferences are entangled in various ways (Liu\n2011). For instance, the crucial notion\nof expected utility entangles probability, representing beliefs, with\nutilities, standing for preferences. Players faced with probabilistic\nuncertainty about the opponent\u2019s present and future actions are\noften advised to maximize expected utility (von\nNeumann & Morgenstern 1944; Savage 1954). Hence, even if\none has found qualitative counterparts for probabilistic belief and\ncardinal utility separately, entanglement poses the additional\ndifficulty of merging these two qualitative analyses in a way that\nmatches what the quantitative side achieves easily by forming some\narithmetical combination of both components.\n\n\n",
