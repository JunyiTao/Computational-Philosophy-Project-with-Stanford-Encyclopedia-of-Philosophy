    "main_text": "Perception\n3. Perception\n\nPrice\u2019s fame rests most on his views on perception, expressed in\nhis first book Perception (1932) and many articles (1924;\n1926a; 1926b; 1927; 1928; 1941; 1943\u20131944; 1951; 1952a; 1952b;\n1956; 1959a; 1959b; 1960; 1964a). In his most cited passage, he\nwrites, \u201cwhen I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt.\n\u2026 but that something is red and round then and there I cannot\ndoubt\u201d (1932: 3; Robinson 1994: 32 calls this an expression of\nthe \u201cPhenomenal Principle\u201d; see also Martin\u2019s (2000:\n218ff) \u201cActualism\u201d; for discussion: Crane 2000:\n176\u2013177; Raleigh 2009: 64\u201365; Fish 2010: 5; O\u2019Shea\n2007: 109\u2013110; Johnston 2018: 175f; Locatelli 2014: 147f). I\ncannot, according to Price, doubt that there is present to my\nconsciousness at that time a genuinely red thing with a certain shape;\nit is just obvious and \u201cquite plain that I am acquainted with an\nactual instance of [here: redness]\u201d (1932: 63; for discussion:\nSnowdon 1992: 73). This thing is (directly) sensed by me,\ngiven to me, and he calls it a sense-datum (this is\ncalled the \u201csense-datum inference\u201d by Chisholm 1963: 102;\nO\u2019Shea 2007: 141 argues that Price along with Russell relies on\nan \u201cact/object\u201d model of sensory cognition here; however,\nsee Price 1969: 363\u2013365 on the act-object distinction).\n\nPrice claims immediately that our core beliefs about the world depend\non our visual and tactual experiences which have the\njust-characterised structure. However, he is at pains to say both (i)\nwhat he does not take to be indubitable (1932: 3\u20134;\n1924: 20\u201324) and (ii) that \u201cour data, the undeniable facts\nwith which he must begin, are never mere sense-data\u201d (1924: 24),\nfor they also involve non-sensuous data. He has sometimes been\ncredited with the view that our knowledge of sense-data and their\nfeatures is indubitable\u2014for instance, Grossmann (1990:\n113\u2013114) criticises Price here by arguing that we can indeed be\nmistaken about the properties of our impressions, something revealed\nby closer inspection. However, Price insists (e.g., 1924: 21) that one\nmay make \u201cmistakes of detail\u201d, e.g., whether a sense-datum\nis uniformly one shade of red, but one cannot mistake a colour for a\nsound or a smell.\n\nThe famous tomato-passage\u2019s crucial move is that at least\nsome of the genuine properties the given item has are obvious to\nus. This allows us to fix further properties of the sense-data in\nlight of what we can determine about the external world. \n\nPrice (1932: ch. 2) identifies two theoretical goals for sense-data\ntheories. It is clear that for a subject to have the complex beliefs\nabout the material world that we have, the subject must do more than\nsimply sense or be acquainted with sense-data. Further mental\nprocesses which he calls \u201cperceptual consciousness\u201d (1932:\n25) are required. One task is to describe fully what the components of\nperceptual consciousness are; another is to say what it is for a\nsense-datum to \u201cbelong to\u201d a material object,\n\u201cbelonging to\u201d being what Price, following Moore (Price\n1932: vi), calls the relation between a material object and a\nsense-datum when sensing that sense-datum counts as perceiving that\nmaterial object.\n",
