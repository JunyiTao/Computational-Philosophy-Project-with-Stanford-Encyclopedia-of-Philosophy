    "main_text": "Additional Dance and Philosophy Connections || Dance, Ethics and Social-Political Philosophy\n5.2 Dance, Ethics and Social-Political Philosophy\n\nHere the reader is encouraged to consult ethics, social and political\nphilosophy journals as well as those journals that highlight cultural\nand critical studies (such as gender, race, disability, ethnicity,\nLGBTQ+ and others), along with dance studies and dance history\njournals and books. For a subject-related entry that discusses the\ninfluence of post-structuralism and politics on dance philosophy see\nPakes 2019. (Cf. Cull \u00d3 Maoilearca 2012 for a Deleuzean account\nof the ethics of performance that might apply to dance.)\n\nAdditional sources one might consult here include Fiona Bannon\u2019s\nbook (2018) and dance and ethics, which among other things makes use\nof Spinoza and Martin Buber\u2019s theories of ethics, Karen\nBond\u2019s comprehensive and multifaceted book, Dance and\nQuality of Life (which addresses among other things how dance\ncontributes to what is good for human beings, which is why this work has been included under the ethics category), Bresnahan and Deckard 2019\nand Hall 2018 on disability and dance, DeFrantz\u2019s work on black\ndance and aesthetics (forthcoming and elsewhere), Eva Kit Wah\nMan\u2019s new book on bodies, aesthetics and politics in China\n(2019) (which is not specifically on dance), Royona Mitra\u2019s work\non Akram Khan\u2019s style of dance and choreography as a form of\ninter-culturalism (2015 and 2018), Eric Mullis\u2019 forthcoming\nessay on dance and political power, Halifu Osumare\u2019s powerful\nmemoir, Dancing in Blackness (2018), and Sherman 2018 on\ndancers, soldiers and emotional engagement. See also the three-part\nessay on dance as embodied ethics in Bresnahan, Katan-Schmid, and\nHouston (2020).\n",
