    "main_text": "What is transcendental idealism? || Kant\u2019s criticisms of Berkeley\n6.1 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Berkeley\n\nWe have seen above that from Kant\u2019s point of view, both Leibniz\nand Newton\u2014and perhaps some of their followers\u2014defend\nversions of \u201ctranscendental realism.\u201d This is due to their\nsupport of the view\u2014or perhaps commitment to the view (on other\ngrounds)\u2014that space and time are independent of intuition in\nsome sense. They may also be adherents of this realist position on the\ngrounds that they do not articulate the view Kant defends in the\nMetaphysical Exposition, viz. that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space and time. But what does it mean for\nKant to say that space and time are somehow dependent on intuition?\nOne way of achieving some clarity in this domain is to fill out what\nKant regards as the relevant conceptual landscape by looking to his\ncharacterization of another idealist position, that of Berkeley (as he\nunderstands him). So suppose that space is not a property of objects\nindependent of intuition in any sense\u2014it does not even\nsupervene on properties of objects that are independent of\nintuition (recall that for Leibniz, space supervenes on the monadic\norder because objects and relations supervene on that order). On the\nview I want to consider, space does not supervene on properties of\nobjects that are independent of intuition because there are no such\nproperties. Suppose that space is indeed dependent on intuition, but\non empirical intuition. I take this to represent one\npossible construal of Berkeley\u2019s phrase, esse est\npercipii. This consideration suggests that, prima facie,\nKant should not interpret Berkeley as a transcendental realist. And if\nthat is right, what prevents Berkeley from being understood as a\ntranscendental idealist? Correlatively, what prevents one from\nunderstanding transcendental idealism as some kind of Berkeleyan\nidealism about space and time? These sorts of question can help to\nclarify what Kant understands by transcendental idealism, for\nKant seems to view Berkeley as a fellow idealist, but one who does not\ndefend a transcendental variety of this position.\n\nIronically, the view that Kant is\u2014perhaps despite his fervent\ndenials\u2014an idealist of the Berkeleyan variety arose in one of\nthe first critical appraisals of the Critique, the so-called\nGarve-Feder review of\n 1782.[27]\n In the Prolegomena, written directly after the review, Kant\n is concerned to distinguish his version of idealism from\n Berkeley\u2019s; one point he emphasizes hinges on their differing\n conceptions of space. In considering the question of why his early\n critics Garve and Feder interpreted him as a Berkeleyan idealist, he\n writes:\n\nThe solution to this difficulty rests upon something that could have\nbeen very easily seen from the context of the work, if one had wanted\nto. Space and time, along with what they contain, are not things, or\nproperties of things, in themselves, but belong merely to the\nappearances of such things; thus far I am in agreement with the\nprevious idealists. But these idealists, and among them especially\nBerkeley, saw space as a merely empirical representation, a\nrepresentation which, just like the appearances in space together with\nall of the determinations of space, would be known to us only by means\nof experience or perception; I show on the contrary, first, that space\n(and time too, to which Berkeley gave no attention), along with all\nits determinations, can be cognized by us a priori, for\nspace, as well as time, inheres in us before all perception or\nexperience as a pure form of our sensibility and makes possible all\nintuition from sensibility, and therefore all appearances (Ak 4:\n374\u20135).\n\n\nSo from Kant\u2019s point of view, Berkeley rejects transcendental\nrealism\u2014he rejects the notion that space is a thing in itself,\nor a property of things in\n themselves.[28]\n He presumably also rejects the idea that space and time are\nindependent of intuition. In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant admits\nthat one cannot \u201cblame\u201d Berkeley for falling into a\nradical version of idealism in an attempt to avoid the\n\u201cabsurdities\u201d of transcendental realism, absurdities into\nwhich Kant takes the Newtonians to have fallen (B70\u20131)\u2014these are\nthe very absurdities discussed above in the section on Kant\u2019s\ncriticisms of Newton. Kant seems to be suggesting with this remark\nthat Berkeley\u2014who was himself a fierce critic of the Newtonian\nidea of absolute or mathematical space\u2014defended the view that\nspace and time are dependent on intuition, that they are not\n\u201ctranscendentally real,\u201d in order to evade the Newtonian\nconception. And just before the Refutation of Idealism, Kant\nemphasizes again that Berkeley avoids transcendental realism\n(B274\u2014see Wilson 1999, 276\u201393). From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nBerkeley correctly avoids transcendental realism, but does so by\nfalsely claiming that space is dependent on empirical\nintuition. This is a mistake, as we have seen, because Kant thinks\nthat the representation of space cannot be empirical. It is precisely\nthis sort of view, in turn, that Kant cites when concluding that space\nmust be dependent on a priori intuition in some sense. So\nperhaps transcendental idealism is transcendental\u2014and\nnot merely idealist\u2014because it contains the view that\nour representation of space is non-empirical as an essential\ncomponent.\n\nWhat, then, of Kant\u2019s famous contention that endorsing\ntranscendental realism commits one to empirical idealism (A368\u20139)? It\nwould seem, prima facie, that Berkeley ought to be committed\nto empirical idealism, and yet Kant interprets him as\nrejecting transcendental realism. I take it that Berkeley\navoids transcendental realism, and therefore merely empirical\nidealism, by defending a more radical dogmatic idealism\n(B274\u20135). According to that view, there are no objects or properties\nthat are independent of\n intuition.[29]\n In contrast, Kant interprets the Leibnizians as thinking both that\nthe order of substances is transcendentally real, i.e. independent of\nintuition per se, and also as thinking that well-founded\nphenomena and their relations are not real\u2014the latter emerge\nfrom our misrepresentation of the underlying non-relational monadic\nreality. The phenomenal world of objects bearing spatial and causal\nrelations is merely ideal. It is perhaps in that sense that\nthe Leibnizians are committed to empirical\n idealism.[30]\n",
