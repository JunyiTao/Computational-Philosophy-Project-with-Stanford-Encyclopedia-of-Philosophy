    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Doctrine of the Transcendent Points\n4.3 Doctrine of the Transcendent Points\n\nDuring his stay in Paris between 1297 and 1299, Llull participated in\nthe discussion against Averroism, specifically against \u201cthe\ntheory of double truth\u201d. In the context of this dispute, he\ndeveloped what is known as the doctrine of the transcendent points,\nwhich tries to solve the problem of the discontinuities in the process\nof acquiring knowledge and ultimately show that faith and knowledge do\nnot differ.\n\nLlull\u2019s starting point is to identify that truth is found above\nman\u2019s own capabilities in two senses. First, the knowledge that\nman gets from the world, through his sensitive faculties, is\ninsufficient to build an accurate truth of the world. Consequently,\nman must overcome this initial level. It is then when, according to\nLlull, happens the transcendental move that encourages man to look for\nthe objects that are characteristic of his superior faculties, that\nis, the intelligible things, allowing him to reach the knowledge that\nscience and philosophy can offer. But this knowledge is also limited\nand insufficient. Thus, he must leap forward to transcend and surpass\nhimself. His purpose will be to reach the divine objects, the\ndignities, recognizing in them, in a superlative way, what were mere\nhuman concepts before. This is proper theological knowledge.\n\nEven if the main function of the doctrine of the transcendent points\nis fundamentally polemical, it is associated with two central elements\nin Llull\u2019s logic. The first one is the formulation of the\nexistence of three types of objects of knowledge, sensitive,\nintellective, and divine, which correspond to the three degrees of the\nadjective in language: positive, comparative, and superlative. In this\nway, it would be related to the three ways of logical demonstration\nthat, according to Rubio (2008a), Llull used in the Ars. The\nfirst two are the propter quid and quia proofs from\nAristotelian logic: (1) when the effect is proven by its cause (e.g.,\nWhen the sun is shining, it must be daytime); (2) when the cause is\nproven by its effect (e.g., It is daytime; therefore, the sun must be\nshining). The third demonstration is designated by Llull as\nargumentum per aequiparantiam or by equivalence, according to\nwhich the demonstration is produced when a thing is equal to another.\nFor example, God cannot sin because his power is equal to his will,\nand by his will he does not want to sin.\n",
