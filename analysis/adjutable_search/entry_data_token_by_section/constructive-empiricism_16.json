    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || Observable versus Observed\n3.4 Observable versus Observed\n\nAccording to the constructive empiricist, \u201cthere is no purely\nepistemic warrant for going beyond our evidence\u201d (van Fraassen\n2007, 343). But then why does the constructive empiricist hold that\nthe aim of science involves going beyond our evidence? Empiricism\nwants to be epistemically modest, but belief that a theory is\nempirically adequate goes well beyond the deliverances of experience.\nHence, one can object to constructive empiricism by suggesting that it\nis not sufficiently epistemically modest: the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what is observable should be replaced with the\ndoctrine that the aim of science is truth about what\u2019s actually\nbeen observed. (For versions of this criticism, see for example\nGutting 1985, Railton 1990, Rosen 1994, and Alspector-Kelly 2001.)\n\nThe constructive empiricist\u2019s reply, as presented by Monton and\nvan Fraassen (2003, 407\u2013408), is as follows. Constructive\nempiricism incorporates a prior commitment to the rationality of\nscience\u2014it is a doctrine about what the aim of science actually\nis; it is not attempting to present a revisionary account of how\nscience should be done. According to the doctrine that the aim of\nscience is truth about what\u2019s been observed,\n\nthere would be no scientific reason for someone to do an experiment\nwhich would generate a phenomenon that had never been observed before.\nBut one of the hallmarks of good scientists is that they perform\nexperiments pushing beyond the limits of what has been observed so\nfar. (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 407)\n\n\nThe constructive empiricist can hence conclude that the doctrine that\nthe aim of science is truth about what\u2019s been observed\n\u201cfails to capture our idea of what it is to do good\nscience\u201d (Monton and van Fraassen 2003, 407).\n",
