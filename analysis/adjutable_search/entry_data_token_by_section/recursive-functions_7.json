    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Entscheidungsproblem and Undecidability\n1.7 The Entscheidungsproblem and Undecidability\n\nIn addition to the goal of widening the scope of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nIncompleteness Theorems, another motivation for work on recursive\nfunctions during the 1930s was the study of so-called\nundecidable (or unsolvable) problems. The\noriginal example of such a problem was that of determining whether a\ngiven formula \\(\\varphi\\) of first-order logic is\nvalid\u2014i.e., true in all of its models. This was first\ndescribed as the Entscheidungsproblem (or decision\nproblem) for first-order logic by Hilbert & Ackermann in\ntheir textbook Grundz\u00fcge der theoretischen Logik\n (1928):[18]\n\n\n\nThe Entscheidungsproblem is solved if one knows a procedure,\nwhich permits the decision of the universality [i.e., validity] or\nsatisfiability of a given logical expression by finitely many\noperations. The solution of the problem of decision is of fundamental\nimportance to the theory of all domains whose propositions can be\nlogically described using finitely many axioms. (Hilbert &\nAckermann 1928,\n 73)[19]\n\n\n\nThis passage illustrates another sense in which the question of the\ndecidability of logical derivability is connected to the concerns\nwhich had initiated Hilbert\u2019s study of metamathematics. For note\nthat if \\(\\Gamma\\) is a finite set of axioms\n\\(\\{\\gamma_1,\\ldots,\\gamma_k\\}\\), then the question of whether\n\\(\\psi\\) is a logical consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\) is equivalent to\nwhether the sentence \\(\\varphi=_{\\textrm{df}} (\\gamma_1 \\wedge \\ldots\n\\wedge \\gamma_k) \\rightarrow \\psi\\) is logically valid. By\n G\u00f6del\u2019s Completeness Theorem (see the entry on G\u00f6del)\n for first-order logic, this is equivalent to the derivability of\n\\(\\varphi\\) from Hilbert & Ackermann\u2019s axiomatization of\nfirst-order logic. A positive answer to the\nEntscheidungsproblem could thus be interpreted as showing\nthat it is possible to mechanize the search for proofs in mathematics\nin the sense of allowing us to algorithmically determine if a formula\nexpressing an open question (e.g. the Riemann Hypothesis) is a logical\nconsequence of a suitably powerful finitely axiomatized theory (e.g.,\nG\u00f6del-Bernays set theory).\n\nIn addition to analyzing the notion of effective computability itself,\nthe mathematical goal of both Turing (1937) and Church (1936a,b) was\nto provide a mathematically precise negative answer to the\nEntscheidungsproblem. The answers which they provided can be\nunderstood as proceeding in three phases: \n\n Via the method of the arithmetization of syntax\ndescribed in\n Section 1.3\n Turing and Church showed how the Entscheidungsproblem could\nbe associated with a set of natural numbers \\(V\\). \n They then showed mathematically that \\(V\\) is not\ndecidable\u2014i.e., its characteristic function is not\ncomputable in the formal sense, respectively relative to the models\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{L}\\). \n They finally offered further arguments to the effect that these\nmodels subsume all effective computable functions thus suggesting the\nfunction is not computable in the informal sense either.\n\n\nThe first of these steps can be undertaken by defining \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nV & = \\{\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner : \\varphi \\text{ is logically valid} \\} \\\\\n& =  \\{\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner :  \\mathfrak{M} \\models \\varphi \\text{ for all } \\mathcal{L}_{\\varphi} \\text{-models } \\mathfrak{M}\\} \\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\ulcorner \\cdot \\urcorner\\) is a G\u00f6del numbering of the\nlanguage of \\(\\varphi\\) as described in\n Section 1.3.\n The second step of Turing and Church\u2019s negative answer to the\nEntscheidungsproblem relied on their prior specification of\nsimilar decision problems for the models \\(\\mathbf{T}\\),\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\). Together with Kleene (1936a),\nthey showed the following:\n\n\nProposition 1.1: The characteristic functions of the\nfollowing sets are not computable with respect to the relevant\nmodel:\n\n\n\n\\(\\HP_T = \\{\\langle i,n \\rangle : \\text{the Turing machine $T_i$ halts\non input $n$}\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\HP_L = \\{\\ulcorner M \\urcorner : \\text{the untyped $\\lambda$-term\n$M$ has a normal form}\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\HP_{\\textit{GR}} = \\{\\ulcorner \\mathcal{E} \\urcorner :\\) the system\nof equations \\(\\mathcal{E}\\)-term determines a general recursive\nfunction\\(\\}\\)\n\n\n\nFor instance, Part i of\n Proposition 1.1\n shows that there is no Turing machine which outputs 1 if \\(T_i\\)\nhalts on \\(n\\) and 0 otherwise. This is thus a formulation of\nTuring\u2019s well-known\n unsolvability of the Halting Problem (see the entry on Turing machines).\n Part ii and iii would also now be described as expressing that the\nsets \\(\\HP_T,\\) \\(\\HP_L,\\) and \\(\\HP_{\\textit{GR}}\\) are all\nundecidable. By taking into account the equivalence results\nsummarized in\n Section 1.6,\n Proposition 1.1 thus shows that membership in these sets cannot be\ndecided relative to any of the models in question.\n\nOn this basis, Turing (for \\(\\mathbf{T}\\)) and Church (for\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{GR}\\)) then proved the following:\n\n\nProposition 1.2: If \\(V\\) were decidable (with\nrespect to any of the models in question), then \\(\\HP_T, \\HP_L\\), and\n\\(\\HP_{GR}\\) would be as well.\n\n\nThe proofs which Turing and Church gave of these facts are\nconstructive in the sense that they show how to effectively transform\nan individual instance of one of the models into a first-order formula\nsuch that the formula is valid if and only if the instance possesses\nthe property in question\u2014e.g., given a Turing machine \\(T_i\\)\nand input \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), we construct a formula\n\\(\\varphi_{i,n}\\) such that the computation \\(T_i(n)\\) halts if and\nonly if \\(\\varphi_{i,n}\\) is valid. This method thus anticipates the\ndefinition of many-one reducibility given in\n Section 3.5.1\n below.\n\nIn conjunction with the other arguments which Church and Turing had\nalready offered in favor of Church\u2019s Thesis (see\n Section 1.6),\n Propositions\n 1.1\n and\n 1.2\n can thus be taken to show that the Entscheidungsproblem is\nindeed not decidable in the informal sense described by Hilbert &\nAckermann (1928)\u2014i.e., not decidable by a \u201cmechanical\nprocedure using finitely many operations\u201d. As we will see in\n Section 3,\n the desire to develop a general theory of such undecidability results\nand the relations which they bear to one another was an important\nmotivation for the further development of computability theory\nstarting in the 1940s.\n",
