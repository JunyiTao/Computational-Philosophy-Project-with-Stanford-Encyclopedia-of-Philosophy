Early Views and Intellectual Context\n\n\nWith the hegemony of absolute idealism broken, Germany was awash with\ncompeting philosophical systems by the time Vaihinger habilitated in\n1877. Three important movements are worth emphasizing (for detailed\nstudies of the late nineteenth-century context, see Beiser [2013;\n2014; 2015; 2017]). First, under the influence of Lange and others,\nNeo-Kantianism had become a major force on the intellectual\nscene. Second, due partly to Schopenhauer\u2019s rising star, and\npartly to the continued influence of Hegel and Schelling, grand\nmetaphysical theorizing after the idealist model was experiencing a\nresurgence in the work of Adolf Trendelenburg, Hermann Lotze, and\nEduard von Hartmann. Finally, traditional materialism and empiricism,\nthough very much on the defensive, had nevertheless gained back\nconsiderable ground since their nadir in early decades of the\ncentury.\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s first intervention in these foundational debates\ncame in the form of his short tract Hartmann, D\u00fchring, and\nLange. Its title notwithstanding, the book is less a work of\nhistorical exegesis, and more a polemical defense of Lange\u2019s\nKantian standpoint against the dual assault of na\u00efve realism\n(represented by the positivism of Eugen D\u00fchring) and unchecked\nmetaphysical speculation (exemplified by Hartmann\u2019s\nNeo-Schopenhauerian view, according to which fundamental reality is a\nmonistic vital substance). Vaihinger\u2019s chief charge against\nHartmann and D\u00fchring is that they are dogmatists, that\nthey systematically overstep the critical strictures Kant had placed\non cognition, claiming knowledge of things in themselves (1876, 10,\n17). Both commit \u201cthe original sin of post-Kantian\nphilosophy\u201d\u2014Hegel\u2019s\n\u201cfantastic petitio principii\u201d of \u201cthe unity\nof thought and being\u201d (1876, 67). Lange\u2019s Neo-Kantianism,\nby contrast, represents something like the best of both worlds, and so\npromises a middle path in a seemingly intractable dispute. With\nD\u00fchring, Lange emphasizes the importance of grounding philosophy\nin the results of the empirical sciences. But with Hartmann, he avoids\nna\u00efvely eliding the empirical objects studied by the sciences\nwith things in themselves.\n\n\nIt is not, however, only Lange\u2019s in-principle restriction of\nknowledge to appearances that Vaihinger wishes to champion. More\nimportantly, he holds that Lange has demonstrated that the empirical\nsciences themselves conclusively support the transcendental\nidealist\u2019s position. In Chapter IV, Part 3 of the second volume\nof his magnum opus The History of Materialism and Critique of its\nContemporary Significance, Lange draws on the work of Johannes\nM\u00fcller and Helmholtz to argue that \u201cthe physiology of the\nsense organs is the developed, or corrected Kantianism, and\nKant\u2019s system can, as it were, be viewed as a program for the\nmore recent discoveries in this field\u201d (1873\u201375, 2:409).\nThe basic idea was that such research had shown that our perceptual\napparatus plays an active role in structuring our experience, and that\nthe output of such a process does not qualitatively resemble the\ninitial external stimulus, for which it is a mere \u201csign.\u201d\nSince what we perceive is always the product of such unconscious\nphysiological processes, it supposedly follows that we have no\nknowledge of the objects that ultimately cause our perceptions (for\nmore on these sorts of arguments, see [Hatfield 1990, 165\u201371,\n195\u2013208, and esp. 208\u2013218; Beiser 2014, 199\u2013205,\n381\u201386], and the entries on Hermann von Helmholtz, and Friedrich\nLange). Thus, if D\u00fchring rejects transcendental idealism, he\nsimply has not consistently followed his own prescription that\nphilosophy should base itself on the empirical sciences. And if\nHartmann claims to know the nature of things in themselves, he can do\nso only by flagrantly ignoring the results of those sciences.\n\n\nThough perhaps rhetorically effective, this argument leads to a basic\ntension in Vaihinger\u2019s early view. Vaihinger sums up\nLange\u2019s conclusion as follows: \u201cthe result of the\nphysiology of the senses is that we do not \u2026 perceive external\nobjects, but rather ourselves first produce the appearance of such\nthings, specifically as a consequence of the affection by\ntranscendent objects\u201d (1876, 56). These appearances are the\nresult of our \u201cphysiological organization\u201d operating on\nsensory stimuli. But he goes on to concede that this\n\u201c\u2018organization\u2019 signifies only the unknown \u2026\nY whose collaboration with the \u2018thing in itself\u2019,\nX, produces the world of inner and outer experience\u201d (1876,\n57), that \u201ceven our own body \u2026 is only a product of our\noptical apparatus\u201d (1876, 57), and that \u201cnot merely the\nexternal\nworld, but also the organs with which we grasp it are\nmere images of what truly exists, which itself remains unknown\nto us\u201d (1876, 58).\n\n\nSo, according to the Lange-Vaihinger view, the objects of our\nexperience are the joint product of affection by things in themselves\nand the operations of our physiological organization. This is supposed\nto have the conclusion that things in themselves are entirely\nunknowable, a fortiori not knowable through the methods of the\nempirical sciences. The problem becomes clear, then, when we ask what\nsort of thing \u2018physiological organization\u2019 is supposed to\nsignify. If it refers to a thing in itself (the cognitive apparatus in\nitself), then the empirical sciences could establish nothing about it.\nIn this case, the Langean argument is entirely impotent. If it refers\nto an appearance, then there is evidently a circle in the argument: the\nexistence of appearances is supposed to be explained by the causal\ncollaboration of things in themselves and the perceptual apparatus, but\nthe perceptual apparatus is itself an appearance. Finally, if the\nphysiological organization is both an appearance and a thing in itself,\nthen the empirical sciences can in fact yield knowledge of at\nleast some things in themselves. This, of course, is precisely what the\nargument is meant to forestall.\n\n\nVaihinger does little to assuage these problems in (1876). Sometimes\nhe suggests that they are rooted in the fact that the very notion of a\nthing in itself involves a contradiction, albeit one which is\n\u201cgrounded in the contradictory constitution of our cognitive\nfaculty itself\u201d (1876, 34). In other words, Vaihinger seeks to\nview the issue of things in themselves along the lines of a Kantian\nantinomy\u2014a conflict which arises necessarily from the nature of\nour reason, but which can at least be recognized as such. This,\nhowever, is of little help. For one, it is questionable whether the\nbasic epistemological standpoint of (1876) can even be coherently\nstated without commitment to things in themselves. For another, a\ncrucial feature of Kant\u2019s antinomies is that they are\nresolved by his transcendental idealism, thus lending that\ndoctrine an indirect proof (KrV, A 506/B 534). If the\ncritical philosophy itself were to generate insoluble contradictions,\nthat would be reason to reject, not accept, it. Vaihinger would\ncontinue to struggle with these issues in the PAO, which\nstill aims to advance the broadly Langean project of naturalizing\nKantianism. As we shall see in \u00a76, however, Vaihinger\u2019s\nconception of Kantianism undergoes a considerable shift, now taking\nthe form of what he calls \u201cidealistic positivism\u201d,\n\u201cpositivist idealism\u201d, or even (in what is evidently the\nfirst use of the phrase) \u201clogical positivism.\u201d For more on\nVaihinger\u2019s debt to Lange, see (Ceynowa 1993, 133\u201372;\nHeidelberger 2014).\n",
