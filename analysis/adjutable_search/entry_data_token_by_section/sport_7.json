    "main_text": "Topics in the Philosophy of Sport || Sportsmanship\n3.1 Sportsmanship\n\n\nSportsmanship is the quintessential sporting virtue. It has also\nbeen thought important to civic and cultural life beyond sport (Sabl,\n2008). Nevertheless, the concept has received little philosophical\nattention. The literature on sportsmanship converges on the view that\nthis virtue requires more than mere compliance with formal rules.\nHowever, there are two principal disputes in the literature: whether\nsportsmanship is a virtue at all levels of sport or just at the\nrecreational level and whether sportsmanship is a unified concept or a\ncluster of distinct virtues.\n\n\nThe traditional point of departure in the sportsmanship debate is\nJames W. Keating\u2019s \u2018Is Sportsmanship a Moral\nCategory?\u2019 (1965). On this account, there is a moral distinction\nbetween \u2018sport\u2019 (recreational sport) and\n\u2018athletics\u2019 (competitive sport). Standards of ethics\nappropriate to sport at the recreational level are not equivalent to\nthose appropriate at the competitive level. Indeed, conduct appropriate\nto the recreational sport may be morally objectionable at the\ncompetitive level and vice versa. This moral discontinuity between\nrecreational and competitive sport extends to sportsmanship.\nSpecifically, as the goal of recreational sport is \u2018pleasant\ndiversion\u2019, the essence of sportsmanship in that context is\n\u2018generosity\u2019 (Keating, 1965, 34). This requires the\nparticipant always to try to increase the enjoyability of the activity\nboth for themselves and for other participants. In athletics, where the\noverriding goal is \u2018honorable victory\u2019, sportsmanship\nrequires \u2018fairness\u2019. The type of fairness in question is\nformal fairness \u2013 \u2018equality before the law\u2019 (Keating,\n1965, 34). An equal and impartial application of the rules, as dictated\nby formal fairness, purportedly helps to ensure that competition\nfulfills its purpose as a test of athletic excellence and that victory\ncorrectly tracks athletic superiority (Keating, 1965, 34). \n\n\nKeating\u2019s distinction between sport and athletics has been\ncontested. Simon et al. (2015) have suggested that this distinction is\ntoo sharp. A given contest can contain elements of both sport and\nathletics. Moreover, sportsmanship requires more than, as Keating\nsuggests, generosity to opponents or fidelity to the rules. Not only\ndoes sportsmanship require respect for the principles that underpin\nmorally defensible competition, it also requires positive action to\nprotect and promote these principles. Randolph Feezell (1986) offers an\nunderstanding of sportsmanship that seems to combine both, as\nsportsmanship is understood as the mean between excessive seriousness\nand excessive playfulness in sport.\n\n\nDiana Abad (2010) argues that sportsmanship should not, as typically\nassumed, be treated as a unified concept. Instead, sportsmanship is\nconstituted by four irreducible elements: fairness, equity, good form\nor honour, and the will to win. These elements are not only\nanalytically distinct but also potentially incompatible. However, she\nargues that such conflict between these values can be resolved by\nstriking an appropriate \u2018balance\u2019 between the conflicting\nelements.\n",
