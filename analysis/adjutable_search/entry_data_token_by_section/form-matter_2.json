    "main_text": "The principle of individuation\n3. The principle of individuation\n\nAnother reason that some scholars have thought that Aristotle needs\nsomething like prime matter is to serve as a so-called\n\u201cprinciple of individuation\u201d. While the predominant view\nhas been that this role is reserved for matter, other scholars have\nmaintained either that Aristotle means it to be form, or that he does\nnot see the need for a principle of individuation at all. Some of this\ncontroversy seems to have resulted from a failure to be clear about\nwhat a principle of individuation is, or what problem it is supposed\nto solve.\n\nTo see why this is so, one may focus on a controversy about\nindividuation which Popper sought to dissolve, by pointing out that it\nderived from a false opposition. This was a controversy begotten by a\ndisagreement between Anscombe and Lukasiewicz regarding the principle\nof individuation in Aristotle (see Anscombe et al. 1953). Popper\npoints out that their disagreement is only apparent, due to the fact\nthat they are answering different questions: Lukasiewicz insists that\nform should be counted as the \u201csource of individuality\u201d\nbecause it explains how a thing with many parts is a single individual\nand not a plurality, it accounts for the unity of individuals. He has\nin mind questions like \u201cHow do all these bricks constitute a\nsingle house?\u201d or \u201cWhat makes this collection of flesh and\nbones Socrates?\u201d, and here Aristotle does indeed appear to make\nuse of form. On the other hand, Anscombe says that it is matter which\nmakes an individual the individual it is, numerically distinct from\nother individuals of the same (and other) species. Yet this is an\nissue about numerical distinctness rather than unity. It is perfectly\nconsistent to say that Socrates is one man because of his form, which\nunifies his matter into a single whole, and he is a numerically\ndistinct individual from Callias because his matter is numerically\ndistinct from Callias\u2019 matter.\n\nIt has become conventional to call an answer to Lukasiewicz\u2019s\nproblem a principle of unity, and an answer to Anscombe\u2019s\nproblem a principle of individuation. The traditional view has been\nthat individuation is a metaphysical issue: what is it that makes one\nindividual different from another (of the same kind)? However, some\nscholars have argued that Aristotle at no point addresses this issue,\nbut is instead concerned with the epistemological question of how we\ntell one individual from another (see Charlton 1972).\n\nIt is worth considering why one might think that the metaphysical\nissue is not worth pursuing. The obvious reason is if one thought that\nthere was no answer to the question \u201cwhat makes this individual\nnumerically distinct from that one?\u201d\u2014that nothing\nmakes them distinct, they just are. An advocate of this view\nmight point out that even if we accept that matter is what makes this\nindividual distinct from that one, we still have no answer to the\nquestion \u201cwhat makes this portion of matter numerically distinct\nfrom that one?\u201d. There will always be certain of these numerical\ndistinctness facts that remain unexplained on any theory. But if\nexplanation has to stop somewhere, why not stop at the beginning? Why\nnot just say that it is a bare fact that Socrates is numerically\ndistinct from Callias, and leave matter out of it?\n\nOne might think that one could respond to this argument by insisting\nthat there is an answer to the question what makes Socrates\u2019\nmatter numerically distinct from Callias\u2019 matter: it is the\nmatter itself. If matter can explain the distinctness of individual\nsubstances, why should it not also explain its own distinctness from\nother matter? Whether or not this move is legitimate will depend on\nwhich facts are and which facts are not in need of explanation but may\ncorrectly be assumed to be primitive. The problem is that \u201cthis\nmatter is distinct from that matter because it is this matter\u201d\nseems to be a very similar sort of explanation to \u201cSocrates is\ndistinct from Callias because he is Socrates\u201d\u2014both are\ncases of x explaining its own distinctness from y.\nEither both should count as adequate explanations or neither should.\nBut the advocate of matter as principle of individuation adopted this\nview precisely because she found this sort of explanation\nunsatisfactory, or not an explanation at all. Therefore this response\ndoes not seem to be open to her.\n\nIt seems that those who are committed to there being something which\naccounts for the numerical distinctness of individuals must say that\nthere is nothing that accounts for the numerical distinctness of the\ndistinctness-makers. The only alternative would be to introduce some\nfurther thing to account for their distinctness, and\nso on; but this results in an infinite regress, which, as well as\nbeing ontologically bloated, appears to be vicious, since we can never\ngrasp the full account of what makes Socrates and Callias distinct.\nBoth sides agree that explanation must stop somewhere, but they differ\nover where it is appropriate to stop: is it a basic, inexplicable fact\nthat Socrates is numerically distinct from Callias, or that their\nmatter is distinct? (See Markosian 2008, \u00a78, for a contemporary\ndiscussion of this question.) At any rate, even if it is difficult to\nprove that there is an important metaphysical question here, the\ntraditional interpretation of Aristotle is that he thinks there\nis.\n\nThere are two main texts which have been thought to show Aristotle\nadvancing the view that matter is the principle of individuation:\nMetaphysics v 6, 1016b31\u20132, and vii 8, 1034a5\u20138.\nIn the first of these, we are told: \n\n\nMoreover, some things are one in number, some in form, some in genus,\nsome by analogy; in number those whose matter is one\u2026 \n\n\nAccording to the traditional interpretation, here we have the claim\nthat x and y are numerically identical (or \u201cone in\nnumber\u201d) if, and only if, they have the same matter (or the\nmatter of x is \u201cone\u201d with the matter of y).\nAn alternative reading takes this passage to be about unity rather\nthan individuation: Aristotle would be saying that x is\nnumerically one if and only if x\u2019s matter is one, where a\nthing\u2019s matter being \u201cone\u201d means that it is one\ncontinuous piece (of bone, for example).\n\nThe second important passage for detecting Aristotle\u2019s views\nabout individuation comes at vii 8, 1034a5\u20138: \n\n\nAnd when we have the whole, a form of such a kind in this flesh and in\nthese bones, this is Callias or Socrates; and they are different in\nvirtue of their matter (for that is different), but the same in form,\nfor their form is indivisible. \n\n\nAccording to the traditional interpretation, these lines are saying\nthat Socrates and Callias are numerically distinct because of their\nmatter, not their form, and on the face of it this is the clearest\nexample of Aristotle affirming that matter is the principle of\nindividuation. We can adopt an alternative reading, however, if we\nsuppose that \u201cdifferent\u201d means not numerically distinct,\nbut qualitatively different. In that case, the passage could be making\nan epistemological claim about how we discern Socrates and Callias:\nsuppose Callias is pale and Socrates dark; they are different, but not\ndifferent in form; they differ because of their matter, since pallor\nand darkness primarily qualify their skin, i.e., part of their\nbody.\n\nThere is a difficulty for the idea that matter can act as the\nprinciple of individuation, which arises out of the following problem\nthat can be raised for Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism (see Fine 1994).\nIt seems that two substances, e.g., Socrates and Callias, may have\nnumerically the same matter at different times; that it is possible\n(however unlikely) for all and only the particular elements that now\ncompose Socrates to end up composing Callias at some later date. In\nsuch a case, Socrates and Callias would have the same matter, albeit\nat different times. Moreover, both being human beings, they would have\nthe same form. But they themselves are compounds of matter and form,\nso if their matter and form are numerically the same, they must\nthemselves be numerically the same.\n\nPut schematically, the argument looks like this:\n\nIt is possible that Socrates and Callias be composed of\nnumerically the same matter (albeit at different times).\nSocrates and Callias have the same form.\nSocrates and Callias are compounds of matter and form.\nTherefore, it is possible that Socrates and Callias are\nnumerically the same.\n\n\nOf course two different people cannot be numerically the same. So, if\nthe argument is valid, at least one of its premises must be false.\n\nOne possible rejoinder to this argument is that it turns on an\nequivocation in the meaning of \u201cmatter\u201d. As we have seen,\nfor Aristotle matter comes in different levels. In the situation\nenvisaged Socrates and Callias would have the same remote or low-level\nmatter (the same elements) but they might still have different\nproximate matter, since the proximate matter of a human being is his\nbody. Since a substance is a compound of a substantial form and some\nproximate matter, we are not entitled to conclude that\nSocrates and Callias are the same. Although this may be an effective\nway of dealing with the initial problem, it can be restated so as to\navoid this objection that the argument equivocates on\n\u201cmatter\u201d. Each level of matter is a compound of the matter\nat the level immediately below it and a form. If the proximate matter\nof two things is to be different, despite their lower-level matter\nbeing the same, the reason must be that the forms of the proximate\nmatters are different. We can redescribe the situation so that not\nonly are Socrates\u2019 and Callias\u2019 forms the same, but the\nforms of their bodies are also the same, and the forms of the matter\nof their bodies, and so on all the way down. Although it is unclear\nwhat in general is required for the matter of two things of the same\nform to have the same form, e.g., for Socrates\u2019 and\nCallias\u2019 bodies to have the same form, it seems reasonable to\nsuppose that it is sufficient for two things to have the same form\nthat they be qualitatively the same. So we can ensure that\nSocrates\u2019 and Callias\u2019 matters have the same form, if we\nsuppose that they are qualitatively the same. One might insist that no\ntwo things are qualitatively the same, but there is little reason to\nthink that Aristotle is committed to Leibniz\u2019s doctrine of the\nidentity of indiscernibles. What is more, although strict qualitative\nidentity, i.e., having all the same non-relational and relational\nproperties, may require demanding metaphysical assumptions such as an\neternally cyclic universe, probably all that is required is that there\nbe no relevant qualitative difference between Socrates and\nCallias, where \u201crelevant\u201d means such as to result in them\nor their matter having different forms. While one might insist that\ntwo things must be qualitatively the same to have the same form, this\nalso does not seem to be Aristotle\u2019s view. So if we tailor our\nexample to this requirement, we can thwart the charge of equivocation.\nThe argument then is valid, so we must choose one of its premises to\nreject.\n\nOne might try to reject the first premise of the argument, on the\ngrounds that a person\u2019s matter is essential to them. We have\nseen that Aristotle plausibly does believe this about a person\u2019s\nproximate matter\u2014their body\u2014since a dead body is\nonly homonymously a \u201cbody\u201d. Nevertheless, he is committed\nto their more remote matter\u2014the elements that make them up, for\ninstance\u2014being capable of existing independently of them. He\nneeds there to be something to underlie the change whereby a substance\ncomes into or goes out of existence, to make it consistent with his\naccount of change in general in Physics i 7. There seems to\nbe no reason to deny that, when a tree, for instance, dies, the earth,\nair, fire and water that constituted it still exist in the dead stump.\nBut, if so, there seems no reason to think they could not leave the\nstump, and end up becoming the matter of some new tree. This is all\nthat is needed for the problem to arise. Prime matter, if it exists,\nwill not help: if the elements are allowed to escape the substances\nthat they underlie, it seems that the prime matter that underlies\nthem should also be capable of doing so. It is supposed to be\ncapable of underlying anything; so insisting that it is\nconfined to being the prime matter of a particular sort of thing makes\nno sense.\n\nA more promising option is to reject the second premise of the\nargument, that co-specific or relevantly similar things like Socrates\nand Callias must have a common form. This one might reject if one were\na believer in particular forms. The question of whether\nAristotle\u2019s forms are particular or universal has garnered a\nhuge amount of scholarly attention (those in favour of particular\nforms include Sellars 1957, Frede 1978, and Irwin 1988; those in\nfavour of universal forms include Albritton 1957, Lewis 1991, and Loux\n1991). If Aristotle believed in universal forms, he could have\nconstructed particular forms out of some kind of indexed version of\nthe universal (e.g., an ordered pair of the universal form and the\nthing which had it); but that would make the identity of the\nparticular form dependent on that of the substance that had it. Since\nit is the substance\u2019s form which is acting as principle of\nindividuation, if the common form premise is rejected, particular\nforms cannot be individuated by the substances that have them, on pain\nof circularity: what makes Socrates different from Callias is that\nthey have different forms; and what makes their forms different is\nthat one belongs to Socrates, the other to Callias. To play this role,\nparticular forms would have to be defined independently of the things\nthat have them. It would be a particular form which combines with a\nthing\u2019s matter to make it the thing that it is. Some scholars\nfind this conception of particular forms problematic.\n\nA final reaction to the argument would be to reject the third premise,\nthe idea that anything enmattered is a compound of its matter and form\nat a given time. Certainly the most straightforward way of\nunderstanding hylomorphism is that the compound is compounded of the\nthing\u2019s matter and form at a particular time, and the relation\nbetween the compound and the thing is identity. This way of\nunderstanding composition is not only problematic because it leads to\nthe problem currently under discussion: assuming that things can\nchange their matter, we might well also wonder (a) how just one of the\nmatters, which it has at a particular time, can yield the whole thing,\nand (b) how different matters at different times can yield the same\nthing. An alternative way to understand compounding would be to say\nthat a thing is the compound of its form and all the various matters\nthat it has at different times: \\(X = F(m_1, m_2, \\ldots m_n)\\), where\n\\(m_1\\ldots m_n\\) are \\(X\\)\u2019s proximate matters in order of\ntemporal occurrence. This would solve worries (a) and (b) above, since\nnow all the different matter-slices are incorporated into the one\nobject. It does not obviously help with the problem at hand, however,\nsince, if it is possible for Socrates and Callias to have the same\nmatter at a time, there seems to be no barrier to them having exactly\nthe same sequence of matter-slices throughout their lives (provided\nthat they are not born at the same time, and live to exactly the same\nage).\n\nFinally, one could relativize the concept of a compound to a time:\nenmattered objects are absolutely identical to compounds, but a\ncompound is not absolutely a compound of matter and form, but only\nrelative to a particular time. \\(X = F_t(m)\\), where m is the\nproximate matter of X at t; or, combining this idea with\nthe previous one, \\(X = F_t(m_1\\ldots m_n)\\), where t is the period of\ntime for which X exists, and \\(m_1\\ldots m_n\\) are its matters\nin order of occurrence. This solution does deal with the problem\ndirectly, since Socrates and Callias can have the same form and\nmatter, and yet be different compounds because the times are\ndifferent. There may also be a modal version of the puzzle: Socrates\nis such that his matter and form could be identical with those of\nCallias at a certain time. This puzzle might be solved by also\nrelativizing compounds to worlds.\n\nThere is an exegetical problem with ascribing this final way of\nunderstanding composition to Aristotle, and that is that it apparently\nconflicts with the view that he expresses in Metaphysics viii\n6, 1045a7\u201310, and vii 17, 1041a26, that a form is what unifies a\ncompound. The problem is how to understand the role of the time in the\nunification of the compound by the form: it cannot be just another\nelement to be unified, for the time at which the matter exists does\nnot figure as a part of the resulting unity. If we try to make the\nform unify a given portion of matter into many different things,\ndepending on what time the unifying takes place at, we also run into\nthe difficulty that such a process no longer seems worthy of the title\n\u201cunification\u201d, since the result is many objects, not just\none. Indeed we can reformulate the problem without mentioning\ncomposition at all: if a common form must unify common matter into one\nand the same thing, and Socrates and Callias have the same form and\nthe same matter, they are one and the same. Since Aristotle (and many\nneo-Aristotelians) would surely be unwilling to give up the unifying\nrole of form, this does not look like a viable solution.\n\nWe have seen that there are some textual reasons to think Aristotle\nmakes matter his principle of individuation; but in fact particular\nforms are better suited to play this role. We need to distinguish\nbetween two different questions, one about unification, the other\nabout individuation: (i) what makes this giraffe (or this\ngiraffe-matter) one and the same giraffe (over time)? (ii) what makes\nthis giraffe distinct from that one? The first question seems to be\nthe one which Aristotle addresses in Metaphysics vii 17, and\ndoes not obviously require an answer that is unique to the giraffe in\nquestion. Giraffeness in general may well suffice. The answer to the\nsecond question, however, cannot be the universal species, since it is\ncommon to both giraffes, nor can it be their matter, since they could\n(albeit improbably) be composed of the numerically same stuff at\ndifferent times. It is not so obvious that Aristotle sees the need to\naddress the second question, but, if his forms are particular, not\nuniversal, he is in a good position to do so.\n",
