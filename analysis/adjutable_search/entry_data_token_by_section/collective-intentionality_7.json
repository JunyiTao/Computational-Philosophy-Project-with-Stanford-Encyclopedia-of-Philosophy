    "main_text": "What Is Collective about Collective Intentionality? || Mode\n3.2 Mode\n\nOther contributors to the analysis of collective intentional states\nclaim that the collectivity resides not just in the content of the\nintentionality but also in a specifically collective mode or we-mode.\nIf individuals share an intention, it is not just the case that they\neach intend a joint action; rather, they intend the joint action\ncollectively.\n\nThis shift of focus is best grasped by noticing two main elements:\nfirst, mode accounts include the claim that the attitudes that\nconstitute shared or joint attitudes are to be verbalized using the\nplural pronoun \u201cwe,\u201d as in \u201cwe intend to go to the\nTaj Mahal\u201d or \u201cwe believe that the Taj Mahal is in\nIndia.\u201d Second, (some) mode accounts emphasize that such\nattitudes are not just verbalized in a certain way but are expressive\nof the particular and fundamental sociality of their bearers. Raimo\nTuomela (2007, 2013) suggests distinguishing between (different\nstrengths of) I-mode and we-mode, picking out different ways of having\nintentional attitudes, where having an attitude in the I-mode means\nhaving it \u2018as a private person\u2019 and having it in the\nwe-mode means having it \u2018as a group member\u2019 (cf. Tuomela\n2007: 46).\n\nThe distinctions between attitudes verbalized in the singular form and\nattitudes verbalized in the plural form, and between I-mode and\nwe-mode, are not to be conflated with the distinction between modes of\nintentionality introduced above. Instead, the idea underlying mode\naccounts is to spell out a distinction that can be applied to\npractical (or conative), to cognitive, and to affective intentional\nstates, yielding a conceptual framework for analyzing the entire\nspectrum of collective intentional states. The idea is that the\nparticipating agents have attitudes of a special kind or\nform.\n\nA direct and explicit predecessor of mode accounts is Wilfrid Sellars,\nto whom, as was noted above, Tuomela and Miller refer as a source of\ntheir original account of we-intentions (cf. Tuomela & Miller\n1988). Focusing on cases of joint action and the respective\nintentional states, they analyze an individual agent\u2019s\nwe-intention regarding a joint activity as consisting of (1) the\nintention to do her part, (2) a belief that others will to their\nparts, and (3) a belief that there is (or will be) mutual belief among\nthe agents involved that the relevant opportunities for performing the\njoint activity obtain (cf. Tuomela & Miller 1988: 375; see also\nTuomela 1991: 252; Tuomela 2005: 340\u201341)\n\nIn conceiving of we-intention as a special kind of intention had by an\nindividual agent, the analysis is true to Sellars\u2019 understanding\nof we-intentions (cf.\n section 2.3\n above). As Tuomela and Miller put it, an individual agent can be said\nto \u2018we-intend\u2019 the joint action X if she has a\nrespective individual intention regarding her contribution and certain\nbeliefs about the actions and beliefs of the other agents involved.\nSuch a we-intention is not in itself an action intention on a par with\nthe participatory intention of a single agent, it is an \u2018aim\nintention\u2019 directed at the joint action (cf. Tuomela 2005;\n329\u201330). By contrast to content accounts, this account posits\nthat the intentionality of joint action consists in a particular form\nof intending instantiated by the individual agents involved. If the\nmembers of a group perform a joint action together, then this is in\nvirtue of each of them having a we-intention of the form given here;\ne.g., their joint action of going to the Taj Mahal is performed in\nvirtue of each having the we-intention to go to the Taj Mahal.\n\nIn his first contribution to this debate, John Searle criticized\nTuomela\u2019s and Miller\u2019s account as typical \u201cin that\nit attempts to reduce collective intentions to individual intentions\nplus beliefs\u201d (Searle 1990: 404; cf. Searle 2010: 46). In\nparticular, Searle rejects the idea of reducing\n\u2018we\u2019-attitudes to \u2018I\u2019-attitudes. But he does\nnot understand the reverse claim, according to which collective\nintentionality is irreducible or \u201cprimitive\u201d (Searle 1990:\n404), as having an impact on the internalist claim that all\nintentionality \u201chas to exist inside individuals\u2019\nheads\u201d (Searle 2010: 44; cf. Searle 1990: 406). From\nSearle\u2019s perspective, Tuomela and Miller are right in not\npositing the existence of a form of intentionality that somehow\ntranscends individuals\u2019 minds, but they go wrong in claiming\nthat we-intentions can be reduced to I-intentions plus beliefs. Such a\nreduction fails, Searle holds, because thinking and conceiving of a\njoint action in the \u201cwe\u201d-form is the core characteristic\nof cooperation. When A and B go to the Taj Mahal\ntogether, Searle\u2019s account has it that each of them has the\nthought \u201cWe are going to the Taj Mahal\u201d in his head; and\nthis is what makes theirs a joint action, since each derives his\ncontributory or participatory intention from his collective intention,\nassuming that the respective other will perform his contribution (cf.\nSearle 2010: 52\u201353).\n\nSearle\u2019s account of the structure of collective intentionality\nhas been criticized precisely with respect to the combination of the\nclaim that the \u2018we\u2019 is irreducible with the claim that all\nintentionality resides in individual minds. Some critics have noted\nthat Searle embraces a solipsistic and individualistic methodology\n(see Searle 1990: 415 and Searle 2010: 47) that makes it impossible to\naccount for the intersubjective or interpersonal relations that\ncharacterize joint activities and social communities (see e.g.,\nMeijers 1994, 2003; Schmid 2003, 2009; Zaibert 2003). Such relations\nare explicitly bracketed out in Searle\u2019s account. But it seems\nplausible to hold that successful coordination of efforts in pursuit\nof shared goals requires that the relations between the agents\ninvolved and the attitudes of the respective others figure in the\nintentional structure of this social process. For a complex event to\nbe not just a coincidentally matching pattern of actions by individual\nagents but an intentional joint action, it needs a complex structure\nof attitudes in which the agents involved refer to one another. The\nonly reference to a collectivity Searle incorporates into his account,\nthe plural indexical \u2018we,\u2019 is taken to be primitive and\naccessible to a solipsistic analysis (cf. Searle 1990: 415). Although\nthis insistence on the we-form of the intentionality allows\nclassifying Searle\u2019s conception as a mode-account, its\nelaboration does not look convincing. His conception renders\ncollective intentionality distributive in the sense that the\ndistinctive mark of the phenomena in question is claimed not to be\ninstantiated by individuals together, by individuals-in-relations, by\nplural subjects or groups, but to the full by each of the individuals\ninvolved.\n\nThe description of this strand of the debate sidesteps the fact that\nit is not entirely clear whether the point of Tuomela\u2019s and\nMiller\u2019s analysis of we-intention is to provide a reductive\naccount of collective intentionality. In fact, Tuomela has repeatedly\nrejected this interpretation of the analysis (see, for instance\nTuomela 1995, chap. 9; Tuomela 2005: 342). He clarified that his\nanalysis of we-intention, which remained essentially unchanged\nthroughout subsequent work of his, \u201cis rather meant to elucidate\nthe irreducible notion of we-intention in a functionally informative\nway\u201d (Tuomela 2005: 358) and grounded in an \u201contically\nindividualistic or, better, interrelational\u201d framework (2005:\n342). This suggests reading the analysis not as reductive but as\nexplicative in the sense that it explicates the complex structure of\nattitudes that constitutes an individual agent\u2019s we-intending.\nThis again provides the core element of Tuomela\u2019s conception of\nthe intentionality that guides joint action, i.e., the analysis of\nwhat he calls \u2018joint intention:\u2019\n\n\n(JI) Agents A1, \u2026,\nAi, \u2026, Am\nhave the joint intention to perform a joint action X\nif and only if\n\n these agents have the we-intention (or are disposed to form the\nwe-intention) to perform X; and\n there is a mutual belief among them to the effect that (a).\n\n\nIn the case of joint intention the conatively used \u2018We will do\nX\u2019 is true of each participant\nAi. (Tuomela 2005: 342)\n\n\nThis scheme not only makes explicit that on Tuomela\u2019s account\neach participant in a joint action is viewed as having a we-intention\nin the sense specified above, it also highlights important\nsimilarities between this conception and Bratman\u2019s conception of\n\u2018shared intentions.\u2019 However, as signaled by the\nrespective choice of terminology, Tuomela thinks of the intentional\nstructure of collective action as consisting in individual attitudes\njoined together, whereas Bratman conceives of it as being\nshared among the participants. According to both accounts it\nis a core element of collective intentionality that each of the\nindividual agents involved refers to the others\u2019 intentions and\nbeliefs regarding the joint activity. However, even if it is granted\nthat the crucial difference between these accounts regards the mode of\nthe constitutive attitudes, it needs to be seen whether the charge of\ncircularity discussed above also affects Tuomela\u2019s account of\nwe-intentions (cf. Miller 2001 and Schmid 2005).\n\nThe charge of circularity targets the element of Tuomela\u2019s (and\nMiller\u2019s) analysis of we-intentions according to which the\nwe-intending individual agent refers to her part of the joint action\nX and has beliefs regarding others\u2019 contributions and\nbeliefs. If the agent is to intend to do her part of X and if\nshe is to be able to refer to others\u2019 contributions and beliefs,\nso the objection goes, then the collectivity that is meant to be\nconstituted by we-intentions has to be presupposed. Tuomela\u2019s\nreply to this objection has the following three elements: first, the\npoint of the analysis is not that collectivity is constituted\nby but that it consists in the participants\u2019\nhaving we-intentions, where this crucially depends on their\nsatisfaction of what Tuomela calls the \u2018collectivity\ncondition,\u2019 i.e., the condition that one participant can only\nhave a we-intention if others have an isomorphic we-intention (cf.\nTuomela 2005: 333 and 339). Second, Tuomela takes the analysis of\nwe-intention not to be an instance of vicious circularity (cf. Tuomela\n2005, sec. VI.), since from the pre-analytic perspective of the\nparticipant the performance of the joint action, including an\nallocation of contributions, is presumed and anticipated but not\npresupposed. Third, Tuomela does not view we-intentions and other\nelements of his account as independent building blocks but only as\nanalytically isolatable parts of a complex whole (cf. Tuomela 2007:\n125\u20136); once again, the guiding idea is not to track the\ncomposition of collectivity from basic and independent elements, but\nto elucidate what collectivity consists in.\n\nIn his more recent work on collective intentionality, Tuomela has\ngeneralized the idea underlying his analysis of we-intention to a\ndifferentiated conception of the socially shared point of view that\nunderlies social and collective phenomena (see especially Tuomela\n2003, 2007, and 2013; for a critical discussion see Schmitz 2017). At\nthe core of this conception lies a fine-grained distinction between\nvariations of what he calls the \u2018I-mode\u2019 and the\n\u2018we-mode,\u2019 all of which specify ways in which individuals\nhave attitudes relative to a group whose member they are. When an\nindividual reasons or has attitudes in the \u2018I-mode,\u2019 she\ndoes function as a group member but her commitments relative to the\nrespective attitudes are private, i.e., they regard her goals\nqua private person. When she reasons or has attitudes in the\n\u2018we-mode,\u2019 she functions as a group member and conceives\nof herself as being bound by and committed to what is collectively\naccepted and subject of collective commitment within the group.\nSpelling out the details of this conception\u2014especially the\nnotions of collective acceptance (see Tuomela 2002 and 2007, chap. 6)\nand collective commitment as well as the so-called group ethos (see\nTuomela 2007, chap. 1)\u2014would exceed the scope of the present\ndiscussion. But the contours of the approach should have become clear:\naccording to Tuomela, collective intentionality resides in a specific\nmode of having attitudes, and collective phenomena are individuated in\nterms of complex intentional structures that involve such specific\nattitudes.\n\nA more general criticism of the content accounts and mode accounts of\ncollective intentionality discussed in this and the previous section\naims at the individualist framework within which they are formulated\n(see, e.g., Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Meijers 2003). More\nspecifically, some authors have called for overcoming the\nintentional individualism the most prominent approaches to\ncollective intentionality adopt (cf. Schmid 2009 and Schweikard 2011).\nThis move involves leaving behind the view that all attitudes are\n(reducible to) attitudes by individuals, taken in isolation, and are\nto be verbalized in the \u2018I\u2019-form; this does away with the\nproblem of circularity. The alternative here is to acknowledge that\nsome attitudes take a genuine \u2018we\u2019-form and are rightly\nattributed to individuals standing in certain social relations. The\npoint of such a non-individualist line is not to posit mysterious\nsupra-individual forces or to undercut the intentional autonomy of\nindividual agents, where these are the worries that seem to motivate\nthe individualistic stance. It is, rather, to treat collective\nintentionality as irreducible with respect to its content and mode,\nand relational with respect to the structures that ground\nindividuals\u2019 reference to plural contents and their\nself-conception as subject-in-relations. A non-individualist account,\naccording to which collective intentionality is irreducible and\nrelational, relies on an analysis of the specific relations\nindividuals are in when they share intentional attitudes with one\nanother. One aspect\u2014whose investigation is still in the early\nstages of development\u2014that helps to further illuminate this is\nthe particular nature of the first person plural indexical\n\u2018we\u2019 (cf. Gilbert 1989; Nunberg 1993; Pettit 2003; de\nBruin 2009; Schweikard 2011; Schmid 2005).\n",
