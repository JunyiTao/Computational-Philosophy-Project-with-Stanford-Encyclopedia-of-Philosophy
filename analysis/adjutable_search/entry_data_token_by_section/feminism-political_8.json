Indeed,\n\u201cthe border\u201d becomes an important geopolitical, cultural,\nand symbolic figure animating the work of feminist thinkers in this\narea. Here, like elsewhere in feminist political philosophy, new ideas\nin philosophy are often generated through the examination of practical\npolitical concerns in the lives of women. For scholars working in\nthese areas, many of the issues and theories discussed emerge from\nongoing histories of\n colonialism,\n settler colonialism, and imperialism.\n\nThe writings of postcolonial and transnational feminist theorists\noften raised the need for awareness of multiple global perspectives as\na challenge to Euro- and Anglo-centric feminist theory by focusing on\nthe lived realities of women in the Global South, such as issues\nrelated to working conditions and migration (Walia 2013). Chandra\nTalpade Mohanty\u2019s Feminism without Borders (2003) is a\npathbreaking work in this respect, examining both the theoretical and\npractical political consequences of global capitalism for women across\nthe globe and for the future of feminist struggle. In the Middle\nEastern context, Lila Abu-Lughod famously asked \u201cDo Muslim Women\nNeed Saving?\u201d (2013), challenging the notion in many strains\ndominant in Western feminism that Muslim women are oppressed by their\nown culture (for more on culture see Narayan 1997). Discussing the\nimpact of transnational feminist work during this period, Sharon\nKrause writes that, \u201cthis development involved the \u2018world\ndiversification\u2019 of feminism to a more global, comparative, and\ndifferentiated body of work\u201d (Krause 2011: 106). This\ndiversification, Krause notes, is also due to new literature on\nintersectionality, that is, the ways in which the intersections of our\nmultiple identities (race, gender, orientation, ethnicity, etc.) all\nneed to be attended to in talking about political change (Krause 2011:\n107). Intersectionality also resonates with discussions of\n\u201chybridity\u201d in postcolonial literature, of religion and\nglobalization, and of the experiences of LGBTQ people. \u201cThe\nresult is an explosion of knowledge about the lived experience of\ndifferently placed and multiply-positioned women\u201d (2011: 107).\nGiven so many sources of difference and division among women across\nthe globe, is a transnational feminist solidarity possible? Are there\nuniversal values and commitments on which to ground feminist activism\nand solidarity that do not reproduce Western ethnocentrism and\nimperialism? (For approaches to these questions, see Khader 2019.)\n\nWhile transnational feminist theorists are largely concerned with the\nimpacts of cross-border global processes, indigenous feminist\ncontributions to political theory in the U.S. and Canada have\ndeveloped important critiques of settler colonialism and its\nborders (for more on settler colonial states, decolonial resistance,\nand post-colonial theory see the entry on\n colonialism).\n Audra Simpson\u2019s Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across\nthe Borders of Settler States (2014) \u201cinterrupts\u201d\nsettler colonial conceptualizations of political terms like legitimacy\nand sovereignty with alternative meanings rooted in Kahnaw\u00e0:ke\nMohawk life and the political history of the Iroquois Confederacy.\n(See also Leanne Betasamosake Simpson 2017 on place-based resistance\nto settler colonialism.) In the Australian context, Aileen\nMoreton-Robinson challenges the ways that white women inside and\noutside of the academy benefit from colonialism and strategically\nwield power against indigenous women (Moreton-Robinson 2000). These\nconcerns mark a broader and increasing focus among indigenous,\ndecolonial, and intersectional feminists on critiques of whiteness\n(see also Alcoff 2006 & 2015).\n\nDecolonial feminists overlap in many areas with other women of color\nfeminists, but they bring several unique concerns specific to the\ncolonial and post-colonial experience. In contemporary decolonial\ntheory, these concerns are largely framed within the discourse of\n\u201ccoloniality\u201d, first theorized in terms of\n\u201ccoloniality of power\u201d by Anibal Quijano (2003). Here,\n\u201ccoloniality\u201d refers to how relations between colonizer\nand colonized are racialized, for instance how labor, subjectivity,\nand authority are racialized around the colonial system of capitalist\nexploitation. (For more on \u201ccoloniality\u201d, see Lugones\n2010; Mignolo 2000; Maldonado Torres 2008; Wynter 2003.) For feminist\nthinkers like Mar\u00eda Lugones (2007, 2010), gender is another\naxis around which the global capitalist system of power classifies and\ndehumanizes colonized people. For Lugones and others, including\nOy\u00e8r\u00f3nk\u1eb9\u0301 Oy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed (1997),\ngender is a colonial imposition in tension with non-modern\ncosmologies, economies, and modes of kinship. Lugones calls this the\n\u201ccoloniality of gender\u201d, noting that de-colonizing gender\nis part of a wider project of decolonial resistance opposed to the\ncategorial, dichotomous, and hierarchical logics of capitalist\nmodernity that are rooted in the colonization of the Americas.\nAccording to Lugones, the autonomous, independent, and univocal\nconception of the self is one of the Eurocentric \u201clogics of\npurity\u201d that has become culturally dominant, shaping our modes\nof political thought and action in ways that pathologize decolonial\nresistance. Lugones\u2019 critique is especially evident in her claim\nthat colonized people are not agents. Here, she does not mean that the\ncolonized and oppressed, including colonized women, lack capacities\nfor action and resistance\u2014indeed, she argues that resistance\nmeets oppression \u201cenduringly\u201d. Rather, she points out that\naccording to the Eurocentric logic that defines agency as fully\ncapacitated, intentional, and autonomous, colonized people are\nconsidered non-agential (Lugones 2005: 86). Instead, she develops the\nconcept \u201cactive subjectivity\u201d to name the kinds of\nresistant practices that develop under conditions of oppression.\nRather than a feminist or decolonial \u201cunity\u201d that\ncollapses difference, Lugones seeks to sustain forms of coalition\nacross difference (Lugones 2003). (See also the section \u201cLatin\nAmerican Feminist Philosophy\u201d in the entry on\n Latin American Feminism.)\n\nIn feminist decolonial literature, resistance is often discussed in\nterms of the coloniality of gender (Lugones 2003, 2007, 2010;\nOy\u011bw\u00f9m\u00ed 1997); language (Spivak 1988); identity and\nsubjectivity\u2014for instance, accounts of hybridity,\nborder-thinking, multiplicity, and mestizaje (Anzald\u00faa\n1987; Ortega 2016; Moraga & Anzald\u00faa [eds] 1981 [2015];\nPitts 2021a); and \u201cworld-traveling\u201d (Lugones 1995; Ortega\n2016). Many of these same thinkers argue that feminism itself must be\ndecolonized, critiquing feminist universalisms that claim to account\nfor the complex intersections of sexuality, race, gender, and class\n(see Khader 2019; Lugones 2010; Mohanty 2003; Verg\u00e8s 2019\n[2021]).\n",
