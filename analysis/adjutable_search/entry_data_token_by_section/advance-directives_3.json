The grounds of this authority\nare cashed out differently in different views, but the basic thought is\nthat the former self's superior capacities give her standing to govern\nthe current self. Once the current self falls below a certain threshold\nof capacity, her interests in her current state are so marginal as to\nno longer be authoritative for how she ought to be cared for, and the\ninterests of the earlier self trump.\n\nSeveral lines of argument have been used to establish the authority of\nthe earlier self over the current self. One is to deny altogether the\nindependence of the current self's interests. On this interpretation,\nthe conflict described above is merely apparent. Once the current self\nfalls below the relevant threshold of capacity, she is incapable of\ngenerating her own independent interests, and, despite superficial\nappearances to the contrary, her fundamental interests are really\ndefined by the earlier self. The interests of the current self are\nstraightforwardly not authoritative since they are merely apparent\ninterests. Further, even were we to accept that the current self has\nher own independent interests, there are other reasons to see those\ninterests as lacking authority. If one insists on the priority of\nrespect for autonomy over beneficence, or if one views the capacity\nfor autonomy as the essential core of a person, the interests of the\nearlier self will be seen as having authority over the current self\nbecause only the earlier self is capable of autonomy. Ronald Dworkin's\nanalysis combines all of these lines of argument (Dworkin 1993).\n\nDifferent versions of the threshold approach propose somewhat\ndifferent thresholds for when the current interests of a formerly\ncompetent individual cease to be authoritative. It is usually accepted\nthat the mere loss of decision-making capacity is insufficient\n(Dworkin 1993, 222-29).  Decision-making capacity is context-specific\nand depends on the complexity of the pertinent information that the\ndecision-maker needs to process. A person may lose the ability to make\nvery complex medical decisions, while still being able to decide\nperfectly well about simpler everyday matters. Lapses of this nature\nwould not give the surrogate a license to discount the current\nwell-being of the individual in favor of what mattered to him\nearlier. By contrast, transformations that could leave authority with\nthe past self must involve a more global loss of capacity such that\none can no longer generate, in any context, interests of a special,\nmorally weighty type.  In crossing this threshold, one ceases to be a\nbeing of a certain morally privileged kind: for instance, one ceases\nto be an autonomous individual, or one turns from a person into a\nnonperson. If an autonomous individual loses his capacity for autonomy\naltogether \u2014 the thought then goes \u2014 he may have some\nlocal (possibly merely illusory) interests associated with the\nnon-autonomous self, but his affairs ought to be conducted in\naccordance with his earlier wishes expressive of his autonomy. Or, in\nthe parallel version, if a person turns into a nonperson, he may have\nsome local (possibly illusory) interests as a nonperson, but his\naffairs ought to be conducted so as to advance the interests of the\nperson he used to be.\n\nWithin this basic framework, several variants are possible, depending\non what one takes to be the essential characteristics of a person, or,\nif one accepts the capacity for autonomy as the essence of personhood,\ndepending on what one takes to be the core aspects of autonomy.\nRonald Dworkin's influential work defends the capacity for autonomy as\nthe relevant threshold, with autonomy interpreted as \u201cthe\nability to act out of genuine preference or character or conviction or\na sense of self\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 225). If an individual has lost\nthe capacity for autonomy so understood, this view dictates that her\ncurrent interests (illusory or not) have no authority over decisions\non her behalf, and surrogates ought to cater to her former interests,\nfrom before the loss.\n\n\nIt is, however, important to notice that the capacity for autonomy, as\ninterpreted by Dworkin, comprises two distinct abilities: (1) the\nability to espouse a \u201cgenuine preference or character or\nconviction or a sense of self\u201d \u2014 what may be called, for\nshort, the ability to value \u2014 and (2) the ability to act out of\none's sense of conviction, that is, the ability to enact one's values\nin the complex circumstances of the real world. In many brain\ndisorders these two abilities come apart. For example, a patient in\nthe middle stages of Alzheimer's disease may retain genuine values\n\u2014 she may hold on to family ties or to the conviction that\nhelping others is good\u00ad \u2014 and yet, due to a rapid\ndeterioration of short-term memory, she may be perpetually confused\nand unable to figure out how to enact these values in the concrete\ncircumstances of her life. The set of values such a patient retains\nwould typically be a curtailment of the original set, introducing the\npotential for conflict between the interests of the earlier and\ncurrent self. For example, earlier, the person may have valued\nindependence above all else, and so was adamantly against having her\nlife prolonged if she developed Alzheimer's disease. Now, in moderate\nstages of Alzheimer's, she has lost her commitment to independence,\nbut still values emotional connections to family members, and thus has\na strong interest in continuing to live. On Dworkin's approach to\ndecisions on this individual's behalf, her current interests are not\nallowed to override her earlier interests because she has lost her\nstanding as an autonomous agent: due to her confusion, she is unable\nto act on her commitment to the family ties or on any other values\n\u2014 she is unable to run her life by her own lights, that is, to\ngovern herself. However, on an alternative view (Jaworska 1999), what\nmatters most for autonomy and personhood are the starting points of\nautonomous decision-making: the genuine values that the person still\nholds. So long as an individual is capable of valuing, she remains a\nbeing of a morally privileged type, and interests stemming from her\nvalues have the authority to dictate how the individual ought to be\ntreated. The person need not be able to enact her values on her own\n\u2014 it is part of the surrogate's role to assist with this\ntask. In short, on this alternative view, the capacity to value marks\nthe morally crucial threshold above which the current interests of a\nformerly competent individual remain authoritative for the surrogate's\ndecisions and the conflicting interests of the earlier self can be set\naside.\n\n\nThe two views I have just discussed share the underlying idea of a\nthreshold of capacity beyond which an individual's current interests\nlose authority. This idea has been challenged in several ways.\n",
