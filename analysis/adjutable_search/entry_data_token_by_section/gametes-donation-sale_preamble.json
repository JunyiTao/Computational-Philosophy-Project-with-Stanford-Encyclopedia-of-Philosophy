    "main_text": "\n\nThe donation and transfer of human gametes (eggs and sperm) for\nreproductive purposes raises many important and difficult questions.\nSome of these relate directly to policy and practice; others are more\nconceptual. Gamete donation occupies an interesting position within\nbioethics, having something in common both with other forms of\ndonation (blood and organs, for example) and with\nreproductive technologies not involving donation (ranging\nfrom IVF through to more controversial areas like cloning, embryo\nselection, and genetic modification). It also shares some features\nwith adoption and surrogacy, practices which also\n(arguably at least) involve the transfer or delegation of parental\nduties and rights. (See the entries on\n cloning,\n eugenics,\n feminist perspectives on reproduction and the family,\n the donation of human organs, and\n parenthood and procreation.)\n\nConceptually, gamete donation provides a valuable \u2018lens\u2019\nthrough which to re-examine questions such as:\n\nWhat grounds parental rights and responsibilities?\nWhat rights and obligations do parents have regarding their\nchildren (actual or future) and to what extent can these be\ntransferred or delegated?\n\n\nIt also raises questions in practical ethics and policy, such as:\n\nShould there be donor offspring limits (to prevent the same sperm\ndonor having hundreds of biological children)? And, if so, what is the\nbasis for these?\nDo donor-conceived children have a right to know about their\norigins? Should donor anonymity be permitted?\nWhat \u2018matching\u2019 and selection decisions should the\nprospective recipients be allowed to make? What information about\ndonors should they be given?\nIs it acceptable to \u2018buy and sell\u2019 gametes? And is\nthat any different morally from arrangements in which women are\noffered heavily discounted fertility treatment services in return for\nsome of their eggs?\n\n\nSuch questions are the subject of this entry.\n\nBefore proceeding, however, two matters of definition and scope should\nbe noted.\n\nFirst, this entry focuses on the donation of human gametes for\nreproductive purposes, as opposed to for research. The rationale\nfor this is that most of the interesting ethical and philosophical\nissues here concern, in one way or another, the moral and social\nrelations between the donors, parents (recipients), and children\ncreated, and these do not generally arise in the research context. The\nmain exception to this is\n section 4 (Payment)\n where similar questions of consent, exploitation, and harm have been\nraised in both research and treatment contexts (Baylis & McLeod\n2007).\n\nSecond, there is the question of what counts as (reproductive) gamete\ndonation. At least for the purposes of this entry, we intend the term\n\u2018gamete donation\u2019 to apply to those situations in which\n\u2013\n\nA (the donor) voluntarily provides B (the recipient\nor recipients) with gametes (paid or otherwise); and\nA expects that and/or intends that B will use those\ngametes to create C (a child or some children);\nand\nBoth A and B expect that and/or intend that A\nwill not become a social or legal parent of C.\n\n",
