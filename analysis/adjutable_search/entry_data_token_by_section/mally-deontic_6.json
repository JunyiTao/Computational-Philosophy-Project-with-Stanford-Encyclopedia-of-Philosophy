How could one construct a system of deontic\nlogic which does more justice to the notion of obligation used in\nordinary discourse? Three types of answers are possible:\n\nMally should not have added his deontic axioms to classical\npropositional logic;\nSome of his deontic principles should be modified; and\nBoth of the above. Menger advocated the latter view: \u201cOne of\nthe reasons for the failure of Mally\u2019s interesting attempt is that it\nwas founded on the 2-valued calculus of propositions\u201d (Menger\n1939, p.\u00a059).\n\n\nThe first two suggestions turn out to be sufficient, so the third\nproposal is overkill.\n\n\nIn the following we will point out three facts:\n\n\nFirst, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called paradoxes of material and strict implication are\navoided, many of the \u201csurprising\u201d theorems (such as (34)\nand (35)) are no longer derivable and A \u2194 !A is no longer\nderivable either (section 8).\n\n\nSecond, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called law of the excluded middle is avoided, the unacceptable\nconsequence A \u2194 !A is no longer derivable, but almost all\ntheorems that Mally derived himself are still derivable (section 9).\n\n\nThird, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles, e.g., Def.\u00a0f and\nAxiom\u00a0I, are slightly modified, the resulting system is almost\nidentical with the system nowadays known as standard deontic logic\n(section 10).\n\n",
