    "main_text": "The Good: Political Theory, Ethical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment || Religion and the Enlightenment\n2.3 Religion and the Enlightenment\n\nThough the Enlightenment is sometimes represented as the enemy of\nreligion, it is more accurate to see it as critically directed against\nvarious (arguably contingent) features of religion, such as\nsuperstition, enthusiasm, fanaticism and supernaturalism. Indeed the\neffort to discern and advocate for a religion purified of such\nfeatures \u2013 a \u201crational\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\nreligion \u2013 is more typical of the Enlightenment than opposition\nto religion as such. Even Voltaire, who is perhaps the most\npersistent, powerful, vocal Enlightenment critic of religion, directs\nhis polemic mostly against the Catholic Church in France \u2013\n\u201cl\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d in his famous sign-off in\nhis letters, \u201c\u00c9crasez\nl\u2019inf\u00e2me\u201d (\u201cCrush the infamous\u201d)\nrefers to the Church, not to religion as such. However, controversy\nregarding the truth-value or reasonableness of religious belief in\ngeneral, Christian belief in particular, and controversy regarding the\nproper place of religion in society, occupies a particularly central\nplace in the Enlightenment. It\u2019s as if the terrible, violent\nconfessional strife in the early modern period in Europe, the bloody\ndrawn-out wars between the Christian sects, was removed to the\nintellectual arena in the Enlightenment and became a set of more\ngeneral philosophical controversies.\n\nAlongside the rise of the new science, the rise of Protestantism in\nwestern Christianity also plays an important role in generating the\nEnlightenment. The original Protestants assert a sort of individual\nliberty with respect to questions of faith against the paternalistic\nauthority of the Church. The \u201cliberty of conscience\u201d, so\nimportant to Enlightenment thinkers in general, and asserted against\nall manner of paternalistic authorities (including Protestant),\ndescends from this Protestant assertion. The original Protestant\nassertion initiates a crisis of authority regarding religious belief,\na crisis of authority that, expanded and generalized and even, to some\nextent, secularized, becomes a central characteristic of the\nEnlightenment spirit. The original Protestant assertion against the\nCatholic Church bases itself upon the authority of scripture. However,\nin the Enlightenment, the authority of scripture is strongly\nchallenged, especially when taken literally. Developing natural\nscience renders acceptance of a literal version of the Bible\nincreasingly untenable. But authors such as Spinoza (in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus) present ways of interpreting\nscripture according to its spirit, rather than its letter, in order to\npreserve its authority and truth, thus contributing to the\nEnlightenment controversy of whether some rationally purified version\nof the religion handed down in the culture belongs to the true\nphilosophical representation of the world or not; and, if so, what its\ncontent is.\n\nIt is convenient to discuss religion in the Enlightenment by\npresenting four characteristic forms of Enlightenment religion in\nturn: deism, religion of the heart, fideism and atheism.\n\nDeism. Deism is the form of religion most associated with the\nEnlightenment. According to deism, we can know by the natural light of\nreason that the universe is created and governed by a supreme\nintelligence; however, although this supreme being has a plan for\ncreation from the beginning, the being does not interfere with\ncreation; the deist typically rejects miracles and reliance on special\nrevelation as a source of religious doctrine and belief, in favor of\nthe natural light of reason. Thus, a deist typically rejects the\ndivinity of Christ, as repugnant to reason; the deist typically\ndemotes the figure of Jesus from agent of miraculous redemption to\nextraordinary moral teacher. Deism is the form of religion fitted to\nthe new discoveries in natural science, according to which the cosmos\ndisplays an intricate machine-like order; the deists suppose that the\nsupposition of God is necessary as the source or author of this order.\nThough not a deist himself, Isaac Newton provides fuel for deism with\nhis argument in his Opticks (1704) that we must infer from\nthe order and beauty in the world to the existence of an intelligent\nsupreme being as the cause of this order and beauty. Samuel Clarke,\nperhaps the most important proponent and popularizer of Newtonian\nphilosophy in the early eighteenth century, supplies some of the more\ndeveloped arguments for the position that the correct exercise of\nunaided human reason leads inevitably to the well-grounded belief in\nGod. He argues that the Newtonian physical system implies the\nexistence of a transcendent cause, the creator God. In his first set\nof Boyle lectures, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of\nGod (1705), Clarke presents the metaphysical or \u201cargument\na priori\u201d for God\u2019s existence. This argument\nconcludes from the rationalist principle that whatever exists must\nhave a sufficient reason or cause of its existence to the existence of\na transcendent, necessary being who stands as the cause of the chain\nof natural causes and effects. Clarke also supports the empirical\nargument from design, the argument that concludes from the evidence of\norder in nature to the existence of an intelligent author of that\norder. In his second set of Boyle lectures, A Discourse Concerning\nthe Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion (1706), Clarke\nargues as well that the moral order revealed to us by our natural\nreason requires the existence of a divine legislator and an afterlife,\nin which the supreme being rewards virtue and punishes vice. In his\nBoyle lectures, Clarke argues directly against the deist philosophy\nand maintains that what he regards as the one true religion,\nChristianity, is known as such on the basis of miracles and special\nrevelation; still, Clarke\u2019s arguments on the topic of natural\nreligion are some of the best and most widely-known arguments in the\nperiod for the general deist position that natural philosophy in a\nbroad sense grounds central doctrines of a universal religion.\n\nEnlightenment deism first arises in England. In On the\nReasonableness of Christianity (1695), Locke aims to establish\nthe compatibility of reason and the teachings of Christianity. Though\nLocke himself is (like Newton, like Clarke) not a deist, the major\nEnglish deists who follow (John Toland, Christianity Not\nMysterious [1696]); Anthony Collins, A Discourse of\nFreethinking [1713]; Matthew Tindal, Christianity as Old as\nCreation [1730]) are influenced by Locke\u2019s work. Voltaire\ncarries deism across the channel to France and advocates for it there\nover his long literary career. Toward the end-stage, the farcical\nstage, of the French Revolution, Robespierre institutes a form of\ndeism, the so-called \u201cCult of the Supreme Being\u201d, as the\nofficial religion of the French state. Deism plays a role in the\nfounding of the American republic as well. Many of the founding\nfathers (Jefferson, Franklin, Madison, Paine) author statements or\ntracts that are sympathetic to deism; and their deistic sympathies\ninfluence the place given (or not given) to religion in the new\nAmerican state that they found.\n\nReligion of the Heart. Opposition to deism derives sometimes\nfrom the perception of it as coldly rationalistic. The God of the\ndeists, arrived at through a priori or empirical argument and referred\nto as the Prime Mover or Original Architect, is often perceived as\ndistant and unconcerned with the daily struggles of human existence,\nand thus as not answering the human needs from which religion springs\nin the first place. Some important thinkers of the Enlightenment\n\u2013 notably Shaftesbury and Rousseau \u2013 present religion as\nfounded on natural human sentiments, rather than on the operations of\nthe intellect. Rousseau has his Savoyard Vicar declare, in his\nProfession of Faith in Emile (1762), that the idea of\nworshiping a beneficent deity arose in him initially as he reflected\non his own situation in nature and his \u201cheart began to glow with\na sense of gratitude towards the author of our being\u201d. The\nSavoyard Vicar continues: \u201cI adore the supreme power, and melt\ninto tenderness at his goodness. I have no need to be taught\nartificial forms of worship; the dictates of nature are sufficient. Is\nit not a natural consequence of self-love to honor those who protect\nus, and to love such as do us good?\u201d This \u201cnatural\u201d\nreligion \u2013 opposed to the \u201cartificial\u201d religions\nenforced in the institutions \u2013 is often classed as a form of\ndeism. But it deserves separate mention, because of its grounding in\nnatural human sentiments, rather than in reason or in metaphysical or\nnatural scientific problems of cosmology.\n\nFideism. Deism or natural religion of various sorts tends to\nrely on the claim that reason or human experience supports the\nhypothesis that there is a supreme being who created or authored the\nworld. In one of the most important philosophical texts on natural\nreligion to appear during the Enlightenment, David Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (published posthumously\nin 1779), this supposition is criticized relentlessly, incisively and\nin detail. Naturally, the critical, questioning attitude\ncharacteristic of the Enlightenment in general is directed against the\narguments on which natural religion is based. In Part Nine of the\nDialogues, Samuel Clarke\u2019s \u201cargument a\npriori\u201d (as defended by the character Demea) is dispatched\nfairly quickly, but with a battery of arguments. But Hume is mainly\nconcerned in the Dialogues with the other major pillar of\nnatural religion in the Enlightenment, the \u201cempirical\u201d\nargument, the teleological argument or the argument from design.\nCleanthes, the character who advances the design argument in the\ndialogue, proceeds from the rule for empirical reasoning that like\neffects prove like causes. He reasons that, given the resemblance\nbetween nature, which displays in many respects a \u201ccurious\nadaptation of means to ends\u201d, and a man-made machine, we must\ninfer the cause of nature to be an intelligence like ours, though\ngreater in proportion as nature surpasses in perfection the products\nof human intelligence. Philo, the skeptical voice in the\nDialogues, presses Cleanthes\u2019 argument on many fronts.\nHe points out that the argument is only as strong as the similarity\nbetween nature or parts of nature and man-made machines, and further,\nthat a close scrutiny reveals that analogy to be weak. Moreover,\naccording to the principle of the argument, the stronger the evidence\nfor an author (or authors) of nature, the more like us that\nauthor (or authors) should be taken to be. Consequently, according to\nPhilo, the argument does not support the conclusion that God\nexists, taking God to be unitary, infinite, perfect, et cetera. Also,\nalthough the existence of evil and disorder in nature may serve\nactually to strengthen the case for the argument, given the disorder\nin human creations as well, the notion that God authors evil and\ndisorder is disturbing. If one denies that there is disorder and evil\nin nature, however implausibly, the effect is to emphasize again the\ndissimilarity between nature and human products and thus weaken the\ncentral basis of the argument. With these and other considerations,\nPhilo puts the proponent of the empirical argument in a difficult\ndialectical position. But Cleanthes is not moved. He holds the\ninference from the phenomenon of the curious adaptation of means to\nends in nature to the existence of an intelligent and beneficent\nauthor to be so natural as to be impervious to the philosophical\ncavils raised by Philo. And, in the ambiguous conclusion of the work,\nPhilo seems to agree. Though Hume himself seems to have been an\natheist, one natural way to take the upshot of his Dialogues\nis that religious belief is so \u201cnatural\u201d to us that\nrational criticism cannot unseat it. The ambiguous upshot of the work\ncan be taken to be the impotence of rational criticism in the face of\nreligious belief, rather than the illegitimacy of religious belief in\nthe face of rational criticism. This tends toward fideism, the view\naccording to which religious faith maintains its truth over against\nphilosophical reasoning, which opposes but cannot defeat it. Fideism\nis most often associated with thinkers whose beliefs run contrary to\nthe trends of the Enlightenment (Blaise Pascal, Johann-Georg Hamann,\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard), but the skeptical strain in the\nEnlightenment, from Pierre Bayle through David Hume, expresses itself\nnot only in atheism, but also in fideism.\n\nAtheism. Atheism is more present in the French Enlightenment\nthan elsewhere. In the writings of Denis Diderot, atheism is partly\nsupported by an expansive, dynamic conception of nature. According to\nthe viewpoint developed by Diderot, we ought to search for the\nprinciples of natural order within natural processes themselves, not\nin a supernatural being. Even if we don\u2019t yet know the internal\nprinciples for the ordering and development of natural forms, the\nappeal to a transcendent author of such things is reminiscent, to\nDiderot\u2019s ear, of the appeal to Aristotelian \u201csubstantial\nforms\u201d that was expressly rejected at the beginning of modern\nscience as explaining nothing. The appeal to a transcendent author\ndoes not extend our understanding, but merely marks and fixes the\nlimits of it. Atheism (combined with materialism) in the French\nEnlightenment is perhaps most identified with the Baron\nd\u2019Holbach, whose System of Nature (1770) generated a\ngreat deal of controversy at the time for urging the case for atheism\nexplicitly and emphatically. D\u2019Holbach\u2019s system of nature\nis strongly influenced by Diderot\u2019s writings, though it displays\nless subtlety and dialectical sophistication. Though most\nEnlightenment thinkers hold that morality requires religion, in the\nsense that morality requires belief in a transcendent law-giver and in\nan after-life, d\u2019Holbach (influenced in this respect by Spinoza,\namong others) makes the case for an ethical naturalism, an ethics that\nis free of any reference to a supernatural grounding or aspiration.\nLike Helv\u00e9tius before him, d\u2019Holbach presents an ethics\nin which virtue consists in enlightened self-interest. The\nmetaphysical background of the ethics he presents is deterministic\nmaterialism. The Prussian enlightened despot, Frederick the Great,\nfamously criticizes d\u2019Holbach\u2019s book for exemplifying the\nincoherence that troubles the Enlightenment generally: while\nd\u2019Holbach provides passionate moral critiques of existing\nreligious and social and political institutions and practices, his own\nmaterialist, determinist conception of nature allows no place for\nmoral \u201coughts\u201d and prescriptions and values.\n",
