    "main_text": "The Meditations\n3. The Meditations\n\nIn 1639 Descartes began writing the Meditations. And, in 1640\nhe returned to Leiden to help work out its publication. During the\nyear, Descartes\u2019 daughter, Francine, died. There is evidence\nsuggesting that he was called away from Leiden around the time of her\ndeath, returning soon after. Some have speculated that he left Leiden\nto be at her side. Also during this year, Descartes\u2019 father and\nsister died. Descartes\u2019 relationship with his father (and\nbrother) was of the sort that Pierre, his brother, failed to even\nbother him with the news of their father\u2019s death. Rather, it\nseems to have been in a letter from Mersenne that Descartes first\nlearns of it. In a follow up letter to Mersenne, dated 3 December\n1640, Descartes expresses regret in not having been able to see his\nfather before his death. But, he refuses to leave Leiden to attend his\nfather\u2019s funeral, and instead stays to complete the publishing\nof the Meditations. \n\nToday, the Meditations is by far Descartes\u2019s most\npopular work\u2014though this would not have been the case in\nDescartes\u2019 day. This work is important to today\u2019s scholar\nfor many reasons, not the least of which is its including as an\nattached text written objections from some of the best minds living in\nParis. Mersenne sent the Meditations to philosophers and\ntheologians for criticism. The list of critics includes: Caterus,\nHobbes, Arnauld, Gassendi, and Mersenne himself, with several other\nunnamed readers who raised their objections through Mersenne. A later\nedition would include an objection from Bordin. Descartes replied to\neach critic, and the result was an appended text referred to as\n\u201cThe Objections and Replies.\u201d The second edition contains\nseven sets in all.\n\nThe Meditations opens by developing skeptical questions\nconcerning the possibility of knowledge. Through a series of several\ncarefully thought out meditations, the reader establishes (along with\nthe author) the groundwork for the possibility of knowledge\n(scientia). Descartes is not a skeptic, as some have insisted, but\nuses skepticism as a vehicle to motivate his reader to\n\u201cdiscover\u201d by way of philosophical investigation what\nconstitutes this ground. In the Second Replies, Descartes refers to\nthis style of presentation as the \u201canalytic\u201d style. There\nwere two styles of presentation: analytic and synthetic. It is\nimportant not to confuse these terms with those, say, used by Kant.\nFor Descartes the analytic style of presentation (and inquiry)\nproceeds by beginning with what is commonly taken to be known and\ndiscovering what is necessary for such knowledge. Thus, the inquiry\nmoves from what is commonly known to first principles. The\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d moves in such a way that each discovery is\nbased on what was discovered before. By contrast, the synthetic style\nof presentation begins by asserting first principles and then to\ndetermining what follows. Prompted by Mersenne, Descartes sketches out\nin the Second Replies a synthetic rendering of the\nMeditations.\n\nIn establishing the ground for science, Descartes was at the same time\noverthrowing a system of natural philosophy that had been established\nfor centuries\u2014a qualitative, Aristotelian physics. In a letter\nto Mersenne, dated 28 January 1641, Descartes says \u201cthese six\nmeditations contain all the foundations of my physics. But please do\nnot tell people, for that might make it harder for supporters of\nAristotle to approve them. I hope that readers will gradually get used\nto my principles, and recognize their truth, before they notice that\nthey destroy the principles of Aristotle.\u201d Unlike his earlier\nwork, The World, the Meditations parts ways with the\n\u201cold\u201d science without explicitly forwarding controversial\nviews, like that of the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar\nsystem. Specifically, the Cartesian view denies that physics is\ngrounded in hot, cold, wet, and dry. It argues that contrary to\nAristotle\u2019s view, such \u201cqualities\u201d are not\nproperties of bodies at all. Rather, the only properties of bodies\nwith which the physicist can concern him or herself are size, shape,\nmotion, position, and so on\u2014those modifications that\nconceptually (or logically) entail extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth. In contrast to Aristotle\u2019s \u201cqualities,\u201d the\nproperties (or modes) of bodies dealt with in Cartesian physics are\nmeasurable specifically on ratio scales (as opposed to intensive\nscales), and hence are subject in all the right ways to mathematics\n(Buroker, pp. 596\u20137). This conception of matter, conjoined with\nthe sort of mathematics found in the Geometry, allies itself\nwith the work of such Italian natural philosophers as Tartaglia,\nUbaldo, and Galileo, and helps further the movement of early thinkers\nin their attempts to establish a mathematical physics.\n\nDescartes\u2019 letter to the \u201clearned and distinguished\nmen\u201d of the Sorbonne, which is appended to the\nMeditations, suggests that he was trying to pitch the\nMeditations as a textbook for the university. Though the\nendorsement of the Learned Men would not have guaranteed that the\nMeditations would be accepted or used as a textbook, it could\ncertainly be viewed as an important step to getting it accepted.\nUnlike today\u2019s notion of a textbook, in Descartes\u2019 day\n\u201ctextbooks\u201d were intended mostly for teachers, not\nstudents. Typically, at the close of a teacher\u2019s career, his\nnotes would be published for the benefit of those who would go on to\nteach such course material. The awkwardness of Descartes\u2019s\nseeking the acceptance and use of his Meditations by teachers\nis amplified by the fact that he was not a teacher himself.\nConsequently, his seeking \u201ctextbook\u201d status would have\nvery likely been viewed by those Learned Men as being a bit\npretentious. He was, it could be said, a freelancer with no academic\nor political ties to the university (outside of his connection to\nMersenne). And, he certainly lacked the credentials and reputation of\nsomeone like a Eustachius, whose widely used textbook of the period is\nof the sort the Meditations was in all likelihood aimed at\nreplacing. Although the Meditations seems to have been\nendorsed by the Sorbonne, it was never adopted as a text for the\nuniversity.\n",
