    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Frameworks\n1.2 Frameworks\n\nExplications or rational reconstructions were envisaged by Carnap as\nsituated (where possible) in larger linguistic or conceptual\nframeworks, constructed object languages with a hierarchy of\nmetalanguages in which to define and explore truth, analyticity,\nsynonymity, designation and other semantic resources of the object\nlanguage, and of the object language with respect to its\nextra-linguistic environment.\n\nFrameworks always involve logical consequence relation(s), their\ndefinition(s) of what follows from what logically. But this need not\nalways mean that frameworks have purely logical object languages that\nare then provided with empirical interpretations. Other modes of\ninference employed in existing scientific disciplines, including\nconceptual inference, experimental procedures, and the reasoning from\nthese, can also be reconstructed in or by frameworks. Carnap continued\nto hope that all of them could, eventually, be understood in more\nstraightforwardly logical terms, but he realized that this was a\nlong-term program and not immediately on the horizon. In particular,\nthe framework could also come equipped with an inductive logic, where\nthe deductive consequence relation for the object language is\naugmented by a numerical degree-of-confirmation assignment that\nsatisfies the axioms of probability. In any case, Carnapian language\nor framework go beyond what we now mean by a formal language: they do\nnot just involve a syntactic vocabulary and syntactic formation rules.\nFrom the modern logical point of view, a Carnapian framework is close\nto a logic or a formal theory (but perhaps with an interpretation),\nwhile from the philosophy of science point of view, a Carnapian\nframework is meant to reconstruct the conceptual and inferential\npresuppositions of a scientific theory rather than a scientific theory\nitself.\n\nCarnap\u2019s earliest attempts to develop frameworks, which sought\nto encompass the conceptual resources of all empirical knowledge, can\nbe found in Der logische Aufbau der Welt (1928a, The\nLogical Construction of the World), commonly referred to as the\nAufbau, its abbreviated original German title. Carnap there\nfocused on sketching a phenomenalist framework in which scientific\nconcepts could be constructed from pure observation. The idea was to\nhave a single framework relative to which any scientific sentence\nwhatsoever (other than purely logical or mathematical ones) could be\njudged to be cashable or not cashable in empirical, observational\nterms. However, as Carnap soon realized, the framework failed to\naddress theoretical scientific concepts, disposition concepts, or\nprobabilistic concepts, among much else.\n\nThe frameworks on which Carnap worked after this were less specific to\nparticular epistemological problems, and more abstract and general. In\nhis view, the specification of a framework was a prerequisite for any\nrational reconstruction of rational discourse whatsoever. As we will\ndiscuss in more detail below, his Logische Syntax der Sprache\n(1934, translated as The Logical Syntax of Language, 1937,\nhereafter LSS) worked out two different frameworks for mathematics\n(and physics) and developed a corresponding account of philosophy as\nthe logical syntax of the language of science. Soon after, Carnap\nfollowed Alfred Tarski in making the basic concept of\n\u201ctruth\u201d language-relative; and in 1950 he applied the same\nidea more explicitly to the basic concept of \u201cexistence\u201d.\nIt only made sense to speak of something \u201cexisting\u201d\nrelative to a framework (i.e., one could only speak of\n\u201cexistence\u201d as internal to a framework), he said,\nnot in any general sense (external to any framework\nwhatever). This deflationary conception of truth and existence (and\nmany other previously metaphysical concepts) again reflects\nCarnap\u2019s resistance to the suggestive traps set by ordinary\nlanguage and the philosophical tradition that has been too ready to\nfall into these traps.\n\nIn his later work, Carnap extended his construction of semantic\nframeworks by developing frameworks in which probabilistic relations\nplay a central role, including eventually frameworks for rational\ndecision and action (decision theory). The specific details of\nCarnap\u2019s various linguistic frameworks are discussed in the\nfollowing supplements:\n Aufbau (Section 1),\n Logical Syntax of Language,\n Semantics,\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories, and\n Inductive Logic.\n",
