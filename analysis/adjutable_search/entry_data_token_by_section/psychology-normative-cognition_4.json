    "main_text": "Empirical Research || Sociology, Anthropology, and Cultural Psychology\n2.1 Sociology, Anthropology, and Cultural Psychology\n\nAs noted above, the ethnographic record indicates that all cultures\nare structured by norms\u2014rules that guide behavior and standards\nby which it is evaluated (Brown 1991). Evidence also suggests that\nnorms are fairly evolutionarily ancient, as there is little indication\nthat the capacity for norms spread from society to society in the\nrecent past. Anthropologists also have shown that norms governing,\ne.g., food sharing, marriage practices, kinship networks, communal\nrituals, etc., regulate the practices of extant hunter-gatherers and\nrelatively culturally isolated groups, which would be unlikely if\nnorms were a recent innovation (see J. Henrich 2015 for a review).\nMuch attention, however, has been given to the ways in which the\nprevailing sets of norms vary between cultures (House, Kanngiesser, et\nal. 2020; cf. Hofstede 1980, 2001) and the manner in which packages of\nnorms develop and change over time within particular cultures (Gaus\n2016, Schulz et al. 2019; cf. Inglehart 1997; Bednar et al. 2010).\n\nFor example, one line of evidence from comparative ethnography looks\nat cooperative behavior, and reveals variation between groups even in\nthe kinds of activities, relationships, and contexts that are governed\nby norms. Some groups \u201ccooperate only in warfare and fishing,\nwhile others, just downstream, cooperate only in housebuilding and\ncommunal rituals\u201d (Chudek, Zhao, & Henrich 2013: 426). That\nbehavioral variations like these can persist even in the face of the\nsame ecological context (i.e., \u201cjust downstream\u201d) suggests\nthat they are due to differences in norms and other socially\ntransmitted elements of culture, rather than responses more directly\nevoked by the physical environment (also see N. Henrich & J.\nHenrich 2007).\n\nIt is a platitude that different individual norms, identified by the\ncontext in which they apply, their scope and content, and the specific\nbehaviors they prescribe and proscribe, are present in different\ncultures. Systematic empirical work has also recently investigated the\nprominence of different normative themes across cultures.\nFamiliar examples include the different families of norms that mark\ncultures of honor versus cultures of shame, especially those that that\ngovern violence and its aftermath (Nisbett & Cohen 1996; Uskal et\nal. 2019), or the different kinds of norms found in societies that\nprize individualistic values versus those dominated by more\ncollectivist ones, especially norms that delimit the scope of personal\nchoice (McAuliffe et al. 2003; Nisbett 2004; Ross 2012, Hagger\nRentzelas, & Chatzisarantis 2014; J. Henrich forthcoming, also see\nJ. Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan 2010 for discussion of\nmethodological issues). Other researchers have distinguished still\nother themes, for instance identifying the kinds of values and\n\u201cpurity\u201d norms that predominate in a community governed by\nwhat they call an ethics of divinity, in comparison to those prevalent\nin communities that are governed by an ethics of autonomy or an ethics\nof community (Shweder et al. 1997; Rozin et al. 1999; this line of\nthought has been further developed in the influential Moral\nFoundations Theory, Haidt 2012; Graham et al. 2013). Theorists also\nuse these kinds of empirical findings to help assess claims about norm\npsychology, shedding light on those features of individual normative\ncognition that are more rigid and universal versus those that are more\nculturally malleable, and on how such psychological features might\nmake various patterns of group-level variation more or less likely\n(O\u2019Neill & Machery 2018).\n\nA recent and intriguing contribution along these lines is Gelfand and\ncolleagues\u2019 investigation of patterns in the tightness\nand looseness of different cultures\u2019 norms. This work\nlooks at differences in the general overall \u201cstrength\u201d of\nnorms within and across cultures: how many norms there are, how\ntolerant members of a culture tend to be of deviations from\nnormatively prescribed behavior, and how severely they punish\nviolations (Gelfand, Nishii, & Raver 2006; Gelfand, Raver, et al.\n2011; Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson 2017). Tighter cultures have\nmore numerous and exacting standards, with members who are less\ntolerant of slight deviancies and prone to impose more severe\nsanctions. Cultures whose members are more lenient and accepting of\nwiggle room around a norm, and who are less extreme in their\nenforcement, fall more towards the loose end of this spectrum. Gelfand\nand colleagues explore the manifestations of tightness and looseness\nnot just at the level of cultures but also across a number of other\nlevels of description, from the communal and historical down to the\nbehavioral, cognitive, and neural (Gelfand 2018). A central claim of\nthis account is that a culture\u2019s orientation towards\nnorms\u2014whether the norm systems of its members tend to be\ncalibrated more tightly or more loosely\u2014reflects the severity of\nthe challenges faced in its past and present: \n\n\n[t]he evolution of norm strength is adaptive to features of\necological environments and, in turn, is afforded by a suite of\nadaptive psychological processes. (Gelfand, Harrington, & Jackson\n2017: 802, our italics) \n\n\nA group whose ecology is characterized by things like frequent natural\ndisasters, disease, territorial invasion, or resource scarcity is\nlikely to possess a more comprehensive and exacting system of norms\nand to take a stricter stance towards its norms, in part because more\nefficiently coordinated social action is required to overcome more\nsevere threats. Groups faced with less extreme ecological stressors\nhave less dire need for tightly coordinated social action, and so can\nafford to have weaker norms and more tolerance for deviation.\n",
