With\nthese concepts made explicit, Althusser believed that Marxist science,\nor Historical Materialism, could employ them in order to achieve\nbetter analyses of specific modes of production and better\nunderstandings of the opportunities that specific modes of production\npresented for political change. Some of these concepts have already\nbeen articulated in the discussion of the mode of production above,\nbut without being named. To label these concepts and then to add some\nmore, the idea that each individual productive process or element\nstands in relation to and plays a part of a complexly structured\nwhole, none of which is reducible to being the simple or essential\ncause of the others, is what Althusser terms the idea of\n\u201cstructural causality.\u201d This concept, in turn, is closely\nrelated to the idea of \u201coverdetermination\u201d or the theory\nthat every element in the total productive process constituting a\nhistorical moment is determined by all the others.\n\nAnother Marxist philosophical concept that allows the historical\nmaterialist scientist to understand the logic of a specific mode of\nproduction is that of \u201ccontradiction.\u201d This is the idea\nthat, at any given period, multiple, concrete and definite practices\ntake place within a mode of production. Among and within these\nspecific practices, there may or may not be tensions. To take an\nexample from Marx\u2019s chapter on \u201cPrimitive\nAccumulation\u201d in Capital V.I, at the same time as\npeasants holdings were being expropriated in the late 15th\nand early 16th centuries by a nascent bourgeoisie, the\nchurch and the aristocracy were passing laws against this\nappropriation. Any isolable element of the total structure, be it a\nperson, a social class, an institution, or the state, in some way\nreflects and embodies these practices and these antagonisms and as\nsuch each is said to be \u201coverdetermined.\u201d Further,\nAlthusser specifies that the development of productive practices\nwithin a specific mode of production is often \u201cuneven\u201d in\naddition to possibly being antagonistic. This means, for instance,\nthat some economic elements within a whole may be more or less\ncapitalistic while others simultaneously operate according to\nsocialist norms. Thus, the development within a mode of production of\nthe practices specific to it is not necessarily homogenous or\nlinear.\n\nAdded to the Marxian concepts of structural causality, contradiction,\nuneven development, and overdetermination is that of the\n\u201cstructure in dominance.\u201d This concept designates that\nmajor element in a structural whole that tends to organize all of the\nother practices. In much of the contemporary world and inasmuch as it\ntends to organize the production of moral values, scientific\nknowledge, the family, art, etc. this structure is the economic\npractice of commodity production and consumption. However, in another\nera and in other places, it may be the production and dissemination of\nreligious beliefs and practices that dominates and organizes the\nsocio-economic structure.\n",
