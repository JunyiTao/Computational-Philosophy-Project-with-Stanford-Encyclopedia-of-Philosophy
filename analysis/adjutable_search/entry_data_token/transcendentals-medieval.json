General Outline of the Doctrine of the Transcendentals\n\n\nSome modern scholars define transcendentality in an extensional\nsense. Take for instance:\n\nDef: \u201cA transcendental predicate runs through all the\ncategories and extends beyond to their first cause.\u201d (Owens 1963,\n111)\n\nDef: \u201cX is a transcendental iff the extension of the term that\nnames X is greater than and includes the combined extensions of the\nterms that name each and every one of the categories into which being\nmay be divided.\u201d (Gracia 1992, 115)\n\n\n\nOther scholars stress the necessity of an intensional account, which\nleaves more room for the diversity of medieval views on the meaning of\nthe transcendental. A purely extensional definition of\ntranscendentality can perhaps account for Aquinas\u2019 understanding\nof the transcendental as that which runs through the categories because\nof its commonness, but it explains neither Scotus\u2019 understanding\nof the transcendental as that which is not determined to a genus, nor\nthe early Scotists\u2019 conception of degrees of transcendentality.\nMoreover, it fails to explain why Aristotle and Ibn\n Sina[1]\nmust not be considered to have\nformulated a doctrine of transcendentals even though they indeed\nacknowledged the co-extensionality of transgeneric notions like\n\u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019. What characterized the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals as it was developed in the Latin\ntradition from 1225 onwards was precisely the systematic account of the\ndifferences between transgeneric notions as the inner explications of\nthe concept of \u2018being\u2019.\n\n\nAlthough the Latin term \u2018transcendens\u2019 (i.e.\n\u2018that what surpasses [something]\u2019, pl.\n\u2018transcendentia\u2019) has older roots, indicating the\nnobility of being which is free from matter, its interpretation as\n\u2018transcategorical\u2019 appears first in logical treatises of\nthe 12th century. In the 15th\u201316th century, the term\n\u2018transcendentalis\u2019 (pl.\n\u2018transcendentalia\u2019) was framed as a synonym of\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 in the\n\u2018transgeneric\u2019 sense, probably to distinguish it from the\nearlier sense. If the word \u2018transcendental\u2019 was introduced\nin the 15th\u201316th century, therefore, to extricate the meaning of the\nword \u2018transcendent\u2019 from the confusion with a different and\nolder meaning of the word indicating the nobility of being, then the\nuse of the term \u2018transcendental\u2019 by modern scholars to\nindicate a metaphysical doctrine formulated in the 13th century entails\nan anachronism, innocent perhaps, but manifest.\n\n\nOnce the distinction of \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the sense of\npredicative commonness and \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the sense of\nthe nobility of being is made, a further distinction arises,\narticulating different aspects of the \u2018surpassing\u2019\n(transcensus) expressed by the term \u2018transcendens\u2019\nin the new meaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019: \u201cScholastic\ntranscendental philosophy intends a threefold\n\u2018transcensus\u2019: ontological, logical and\nepistemological. The \u2018transcensus\u2019 is\nprimarily ontological in nature, insofar as it is directed to the\ntranscendentia, which are so called, because these terms\ntranscend the categories of being. But the\n\u2018transcensus\u2019 also possesses a\nlogical-semantical aspect, insofar as it is directed to the\ncommunissima, and an epistemological aspect, insofar as it is\ndirected to the prima, the first conceptions of the intellect.\nBetween these three aspects there exists an inner connection:\ntranscendentals are the \u2018firsts\u2019, since they are most\ncommon; and because of their commonness they transcend the\ncategories.\u201d (Aertsen 2012, 657) In the following, these three\naspects of \u2018surpassing\u2019 will guide the historico-systematic\nelaboration of the new meaning of \u2018transcendens\u2019 as\n\u2018transcendental\u2019.\n\n\nFinally, it has to be noted that this new meaning of\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 as transcendental was itself\nsubject to evolution. The Latin term\n\u2018transcendens\u2019 is translated: \u2018that which\nsurpasses [something]\u2019. The term clearly requires a complement,\ni.e. an indication of what is surpassed in the\n\u2018transcensus\u2019. The history of the\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 can be described in terms of the variety\nof its complements: \u201cThe scholastic concept of\n\u2018transcendental\u2019, which since Albert the Great is the\nproper subject of metaphysics, is opposed to the concept of the\ncategorical. The transcendental is therefore the\ntranscategorical. From the 15th century onwards the transcendental\ndetermination appears frequently in opposition to the so-called\n\u2018super-transcendental\u2019, i.e. the most universal\ndeterminations like \u2018opinabile\u2019 or\n\u2018intelligibile\u2019 that are common to real beings\nand beings of reason. With a view to this opposite concept of the\n\u2018super-transcendental\u2019, the transcendental is to be\nconceived as a most common determination that applies to all real\nbeings, including God (\u2026). This constellation of concepts\nchanges with Kant. The concept of transcendental as the common\npredicate of a certain type of cognition is opposed to the concept of\nthe empirical.\u201d (See the entry \u2018Transzendental\u2019, in\nHistorisches W\u00f6rterbuch der Philosophie, Volume 10,\npp. 1358\u20139.)  Since especially the Kantian understanding of the\ntranscendental has been influential for modern minds, it must be\nemphasized at the outset that the medieval understanding of\ntranscendental is not opposed to the empirical, but to the\ncategorical; in fact, all medieval authors acknowledge an empirical\norigin of the transcendental notions. They articulate this connection\nbetween transcendental and empirical in a realist program of\nmetaphysics.\n2. Sources of the Doctrine of the Transcendentals\n\n\nThe Summa de bono of Philip the Chancellor (ca. 1225) is\nconsidered to be the first systematic formulation of a\ndoctrine of the transcendentals. (Aertsen 2012, 109\u2013127) But\nthere are some main sources that provided essential elements for the\ndoctrine.\n\n\nAristotle, e.g., gives an exemplary treatment of the relation\nbetween the concepts of \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018the one\u2019\nin the fourth book of his Metaphysics, where he explains that\njust as being is said in many ways, so also the one; consequently,\nthese notions share the same nature (phusis), while differing\nqua concept (logos). (Aristotle, Metaph. IV, c. 2, 1003 b\n23\u20134) In the tenth book of the Metaphysics, he explains that\nthe proper meaning of \u2018one\u2019 is \u2018indivisible\u2019,\nsuch that to be one is to be indivisible. (Arist., Metaph. X, c. 1,\n1052 b 16.) This model of pairing co-extensionality to intensional\ndifference was to provide the basic framework for a doctrine of the\ntranscendentals. Aristotle\u2019s indications of a focal meaning of\nbeing, which reduces the homonymy of the term in such a way as to\nsafeguard the unity of the subject of metaphysics and its possibility\nas a science (Arist., Metaph. IV, c. 2, 1003 a 32 sqq.), were the\nstarting-point for the medieval reflection on analogy as a mode of\npredication especially applying to transgeneric terms (cf. the entry on\n medieval theories of Analogy). Other important texts in\nthe corpus aristotelicum address the question of truth and the\nquestion of goodness. Aristotle\u2019s different assertions on the\nissue of truth confronted the Middle Ages with a tension. On the one\nhand, Aristotle asserted that each thing is related to truth in the\nsame way as it is to being; on the other hand, Aristotle excluded\nbeing-as-true from the consideration of metaphysics, since it is only a\nkind of intra-mental being. (Arist., Metaph. II, c. 1, 9993 b 30;\nMetaph. VI, c. 4, 1027 b 17 sqq.) In his critique of Plato\u2019s Idea\nof the Good, finally, Aristotle asserts that the good is said in as\nmany ways as being, and hence falls short of the univocity proper to a\nPlatonic idea. (Arist., Eth. Nic. I, c. 4, 1096 a 12 sqq.)\n\n\nAnother main source is the Persian thinker Ibn Sina (Lat. Avicenna),\nwho discusses the concepts of \u2018being\u2019, \u2018thing\u2019,\nand \u2018the one\u2019 as the primary conceptions of the intellect\nin his Metaphysics I.5. He introduces the idea of primary\nconceptions by drawing a seminal analogy between first principles in\nthe order of judgment and in the order of conception: just as there are\nfirst principles in the order of judgment, at which the reduction or\nanalysis of propositional knowledge comes to an end (e.g. the principle\nof non-contradiction), so there are also first principles in the order\nof conception, which are primitive in the sense that they cannot be\ndefined by appealing to some more general notion. Getting knowledge of\nthem is not making an unknown thing known, but bringing something to\nmind that was always already known, by means of logically derivative\n\u2018trigger\u2019-notions. The relation between the two most\nimportant primary conceptions \u2018being\u2019 and\n\u2018thing\u2019, which denote an existential resp. an essential\naspect of things, takes the form of a priority of \u2018thing\u2019\nor \u2018essence\u2019, to which \u2018being\u2019 is necessarily\nconcomitant. An important other innovation, directly related to the\nforegoing, was Ibn Sina\u2019s rejection of the theological\ninterpretation of the subject of metaphysics. Since the existence of\nthe subject of a science must be demonstrated beforehand, and\nGod\u2019s existence is to be demonstrated in the science of\nmetaphysics, God cannot be the subject of this science. Moreover, since\nmetaphysics is the first science, nothing else can be its subject,\nexcept for something that cannot be demonstrated, since it is\nself-evident. Hence, Ibn Sina\u2019s declarations that (1) being is a\nprimary conception and that (2) being is the subject of metaphysics are\ncorrelated.\n\n\nOther sources of the doctrines of the transcendentals are Augustine,\nBoethius, and Dionysius the Areopagite, representing the interpretation\nof the Platonic ideas as divine names in the Christian tradition. In\ndiverse works, Augustine discusses unity, truth, goodness, and being as\npredicates that are instantiated in a primary and privileged way in\nGod, and instantiated in a derivative way in God\u2019s creation. As a\nconsequence, knowledge of created unity, truth, goodness, and being has\nto make explicit this relation to its divine origin, which, in\nAugustine\u2019s work itself and in the Augustinian tradition,\nfrequently takes the form of an ascent to God as a demonstration of\nGod\u2019s existence. In his treatise De divinis nominibus,\npseudo-Dionysius Areopagita gives an extensive treatment of the Good,\nBeing, Truth, Beauty, and Unity as the names of God. Itself adherent to\nNeoplatonic philosophy, in which the Good is proclaimed to be above\nbeing, Dionysius\u2019 work was interpreted by 13th century\ntheoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the frame of a\nsynthesis of Aristotelianism and Platonism that harmonizes the\ntranscendent and the transcendental. Finally, Boethius explicitly\ndiscusses the convertibility of \u2018being\u2019 and\n\u2018one\u2019, and his treatise De hebdomadibus addresses\nthe relation between being and the good, with a view to safeguard the\ngoodness of reality without infringing upon the substantial goodness of\nits creator. One can say that De hebdomadibus was a true model\nfor the later elaboration of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the\nfirst half of the 13th century, which, in its first phase, had a strong\nfocus on the notion of the good.\n3. Transcendentals and Predication\n\n\nThe predication of transcendentals has a logical, ontological, and\nepistemological sense that can be distinguished as follows. In a\nlogical sense, as predicative expressions, \u2018transcendental\nterms\u2019 are outside the range of the five predicables or\nuniversals listed by Porphyry in his Isagoge to\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, i.e. they are not a genus,\nspecies, difference, property, or accident. Their signification is not\nbound to the categorical horizon, and they resist\n\u2018infinitatio\u2019 (for this term, cf. infra). In\nan ontological sense, as properties signified by the predicate of\na proposition that are asserted of the object signified by the subject\nof the proposition, transcendentals are properties that are not\nrestricted to, but run through the classes of things expressed by the\nhighest genera, the categories. In an epistemological sense,\nfinally, as predicative concepts expressed by the predicate of a\nproposition that are connected with the concept expressed by the\nsubject of the proposition into a thought expressed by the proposition\nitself, transcendentals are concepts that cannot be analyzed by taking\nrecourse to a still higher genus and are, therefore, first known,\nself-evident, and primitive.\n\n\nThe predicative context is commonly suggested to be the historical\norigin of the term \u2018transcendens\u2019 in the\nmeaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019. (See Jacobi 2003; Valente\n2007; Aertsen 2012, 42sqq.) Various 12th century logical texts\nrecognize the distinctive semantical nature of transcategorical terms,\nwhich they refer to, among others, as \u2018transcendent names\u2019\n(nomina transcendentia). Three instances: (i.)\nWhereas a Vienna Priscian-commentary partially edited by De Rijk (dated\nca. 1150) identifies a certain class of names \u201cthat are so\nuniversal that they run through all categories\u201d, such as\n\u2018being\u2019, \u2018thing\u2019, \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018something\u2019, the Ars Meliduna (between\n1154/1180) distinguishes transgeneric terms from universals proper.\n\u201cNo name that belongs to every thing, such as\n\u2018thing\u2019, \u2018something\u2019, \u2018being\u2019, and\n\u2018one\u2019, signifies a universal\u201d. Since universals are\nbound up to genera, transgeneric terms do not signify a universal. The\ncategories, as the highest genera, determine what a thing is,\nthe transgeneric names signify that it is. (ii.) In the debate\non \u201cinfinite names\u201d (nomina infinita),\nwhich refers to the possibility of \u2018making a term infinite\u2019\n(infinitatio) by term-negation, a distinction is made in the\nIntroductiones Montane minores (ca. 1130) and the \nTractatus Anagnini (ca. 1200), between finite terms\nand terms that \u201ccontain all things\u201d, e.g.\n\u2018thing\u2019 and \u2018something\u2019. Since these terms are\nnot finite, they cannot be made infinite: \u201cTerms that contain all\nthings cannot be made infinite, hence this is senseless: \u2018a\nnon-something is\u2019, \u2018a non-thing is\u2019.\u201d (iii.) In\nthe discussion on the equivocity of names in the Dialectica\nMonacensis (between 1150\u20131200), a specific type of\nequivocation is identified, in which something is signified primarily,\neverything else secondarily, and this type of equivocation is connected\nwith the nomina transcendentia, i.e. names like\n\u2018thing\u2019, \u2018being\u2019, \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018universal\u2019, \u2018possible\u2019,\n\u2018contingent\u2019, \u2018the same\u2019 and\n\u2018diverse\u2019 as such. (See Jacobi 2003.)\n\n\nThe logical \u2018surpassing\u2019 expressed by the\nnomina transcendentia is the order of the predicables\nor universals described by Porphyry. If the relation between subject\nand predicate, Porphyry claims, is such that the predicate belongs to\nthe essence of the subject, then it is either a genus, or species, or\ndifference; if the predicate does not belong to the essence of the\nsubject, it is either convertible with it, and then it is a property\n(proprium), or if not convertible, then it is an accident. Now\nthe most universal are Aristotle\u2019s ten categories, which Porphyry\ndefines as \u201cthat above which there will be no other superordinate\ngenus.\u201d (Porph., Introduction 2.5) In answer to the\nquestion whether \u2018being\u2019, since it is said of everything,\nis not a genus common to the highest genera, Porphyry states that the\nten categories are primarily diverse, and hence concludes to the\nequivocity of \u2018being\u2019.\n\n\nThe formation of the doctrine of the transcendentals in the 13th\ncentury introduces a class of predicates that are not discussed by\nPorphyry. In reaction to this absence, one can either define the\ntranscendentals in contradistinction to universals, as witnessed in the\nArs Meliduna, or extend the list of universals by\nincluding a sixth universal predicable. An instance of the first\nreaction we find in William of Ockham\u2019s Commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge, who explicitly addresses the question\nwhether the classification of the predicables with regard to the\nconcept of being is exhaustive (i.e. the question of the\n\u201csufficiency\u201d of Porphyry\u2019s division of the\npredicables), and distinguishes between terms that are predicates of\nmany, the universals, and terms predicated of all, the common terms.\n(Ockham, Expositio in librum Porphyrii de\nPraedicabilibus, prooem. 2) An instance of the second reaction we\nfind in Duns Scotus; as a consequence of his defense of the univocity\nof being, Scotus is prepared in his Commentary on the\nMetaphysics to extend the list of predicables with a sixth one, a\n\u2018transcendental universal\u2019 (universale\ntranscendens), as examples of which he names\n\u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019. (Duns Scotus,\nQuaestiones super libros Metaphysicorum, IV, q.\n1)\n\n\nPorphyry\u2019s list of predicables not only occasioned the\nquestion of its relation to transcendental predicates, but also\nsupplied a model to express the relation of \u2018being\u2019 to the\nother transcendentals as the relation between a subject and its\nproperties (propria). Although the transcendentals are\nco-extensive, they differ conceptually. The privileged model to express\nthis relationship was the predication of a property (proprium)\nof a subject, which is defined by Porphyry with two characteristics: on\nthe one hand, properties are convertible with the subject, on the other\nhand, they are outside the essence of the subject. The first\ncharacteristic was of great convenience, since it offers the\npossibility to combine the convertibility of the transcendentals with\nthe basic task of science: to demonstrate the existence of properties\nthat belong per se to its subject and are hence convertible with it. By\nexplaining the relation between \u2018being\u2019 and the other\ntranscendental predicates as the relation between a subject and its\nproperties, the doctrine of the transcendentals gives flesh to the\nscience of \u2018being\u2019 called metaphysics, the core of which is\nthe demonstration that \u2018being\u2019 has convertible properties,\nlike \u2018one\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019. The\nsecond characteristic of a property was more problematic at the\ntranscendental level, for it implies the recognition that the\ntranscendentals, as really distinct from being, are nothing. Most\ntheoreticians of the transcendentals, therefore, denied the application\nof this second characteristic to the transcendental level and held that\na transcendental property differs from being only conceptually\n(secundum rationem). Duns Scotus and the tradition he\nestablished, however, accepted a real distinction in the sense of a\nformal distinction (for this term, cf. infra) in the relation between\n\u2018being\u2019 and its transcendental properties.\n4. Three Models of the Transcendentals: Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent and Eckhart, and John Duns Scotus\n\n\nFrom 1225 onwards, a series of medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals was formulated by such diverse authors as Philip the\nChancellor, the authors of the Summa Halensis, Bonaventure,\nand Albert the Great that are centered, for historical\n reasons,[2]\non the transcendentality of the good.\nBetween 1250 and 1330, the doctrine reached its maturity in the works\nof Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, John Duns Scotus, the early\nScotists, and William of Ockham. The whole tradition of reflection on\nthe transcendental properties of being was synthesized in the\nDisputationes metaphysicae of Francisco Su\u00e1rez\n(published 1597), which built the most elaborate account of the\ntranscendentals known in the high and later Middle Ages.\n\n\nInsight into the variety of medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, however, is better served by the contrast of typical\nmodels of a doctrine of the transcendentals than by an overview of the\nhistory of the transcendentals tout\n court.[3]\nApart from the differences in the internal\nconnection of the transcendental concepts, one of the most important\naspects on which these different models of a doctrine of the\ntranscendentals vary is the relation between the transcendental and the\ntranscendent. According to Thomas Aquinas, transcendental being extends\nonly to created being, whereas Henry of Ghent and Meister Eckhart\nformulate a doctrine of the transcendentals in which God is the first\nknown; Duns Scotus, finally, makes transcendental being indifferent to\nfinite and infinite being; it is univocally common to God and creature.\n(See Aertsen 2012, 666.)\n4.1 The first model: God as the cause of transcendental being (Thomas Aquinas)\n\n\nThe doctrine of the transcendentals of Thomas Aquinas (1224/5\u20131274)\nanswers to the question of how an addition to being as \u2018first\nknown\u2019 is possible. Aquinas\u2019 solution is that such an\naddition is possible as the explication of a mode of being that is not\nyet said by \u2018being\u2019 itself: either through a special mode\nof being, i.e. one of the categories, which contract\n\u2018being\u2019 in their own way, or through a general mode of\nbeing, i.e., one of the transcendentals, the addition of which does not\nyield such a contraction. The basic text De ver. 1.1 explains\nthat the expressed mode of being pertains to every being in itself or\nin relation to something else. If it pertains to every being in itself,\nit can either be said positively, i.e. the essence indicated by\n\u2018thing\u2019 (res), or negatively, and that is the\n\u2018indivision\u2019 expressed by \u2018one\u2019. If it pertains\nto every being in relation to something else, it can express either the\ndifference between beings, which is indicated by\n\u2018something\u2019 (aliquid), or their conformity. Since\nthe soul is \u201cin a sense all things\u201d, it is suited to\nconform to every being. A being either conforms to the soul\u2019s\ncognitive faculty, which is expressed by \u2018true\u2019, or to the\nappetitive faculty, which is expressed by \u2018good\u2019. Aquinas\ndeclares \u2018being in general\u2019 (ens commune)\nto be the subject of metaphysics and God to be the principle of this\nsubject (In Metaph., prooem.). Parallel to this\nrestriction of the subject of metaphysics to created being, there is a\nrestriction of the first object of the intellect to the \u2018quiddity\nof material things\u2019 or to \u2018being and the true as found in\nmaterial things\u2019. Reflection on the relation between God and\n\u2018being in general\u2019, which leads Aquinas to present the\ntranscendentals as divine names, and thus to integrate the Platonic and\nAristotelian traditions of reflection on \u2018being\u2019,\n\u2018one\u2019, \u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019, gives\nrise to the influential doctrine of the analogical predication of the\ntranscendental terms. As stated in the treatise on natural law, the\ntranscendentals \u2018being\u2019 (ens) and\n\u2018good\u2019 serve as the foundation of the principles of\ntheoretical and practical reason (S.th. I-II. 94.2).\n4.2 The second model: The theological transformation of the first concepts (Henry of Ghent & Eckhart)\n\n\nTypical of the doctrine of the transcendentals of Henry of Ghent\n(\u2020 1293) is his defense of the doctrine of God as first known,\nwhich had been elaborated in the Franciscan tradition by Bonaventure\nand had been rejected by Aquinas. On account of his different\nunderstanding of analogy, not treated as a mode of predication as in\nAquinas, but as the property of a concept, Henry achieves an\nintegration of the divine names in his doctrine of the transcendentals\nas the most general aspects of being that recognizes a priority of the\ndivine over the creaturely within the transcendental concepts as such.\nWhat has been called Henry\u2019s \u201cnew way to God\u201d starts\nwith the acknowledgement that something finite is good and goes on to\npurify this content of \u2018good\u2019 along different degrees of\nabstraction, in order to reach the infinite realization of this content\nin God. The claim is that it can only be understood that something\nfinite is good, if the infinite realization of the good is always\nalready implicitly understood (and the same holds for being and the\nother transcendentals). Naturally, there is a major difference in the\nepistemic status of the evidence, on the one hand, that being and the\nother transcendentals are first known objects in the analysis of\ncognition, and of the evidence, on the other hand, that God is first\nknown, exerting a natural priority within these transcendental concepts\nas such. Whereas God is absolutely yet indistinctly the first known,\n\u2018being\u2019 is distinctly known first. Another important shift\nin comparison to Thomas Aquinas lies in Henry\u2019s identification of\nthe concepts of \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018thing\u2019, i.e. the\nessentialist interpretation of being. Henry construes his doctrine of\nthe transcendentals, quoting Aquinas, as a series of conceptual\nadditions to being as first known, but disagrees with Aquinas as\nregards the meaning of the concept of being: it does not signify the\nactuality of being, but the aspect of essence, for which Aquinas had\nreserved the term \u2018thing\u2019 (res). Although Henry\nfollows Aquinas in his affirmation that only negations and conceptual\nrelations can add something to being without contracting it \u2013 he\nstrongly emphasizes the origin of these conceptual additions in the\nintellect \u2013, he asserts that the \u2018negation of\nnegation\u2019 expressed by \u2018the one\u2019 as adding the aspect\nof indivision is something positive.\n\n\nMeister Eckhart (ca. 1260\u20131328) presents the same model of the\ntranscendental as Henry of Ghent. The doctrine of the transcendentals\nhas an unprecedented importance in Eckhart\u2019s project of the\nOpus tripartitum, where the transcendental metaphysics of the\nOpus propositionum is foundational both for the systematic\ntheology in the Opus quaestionum and for the exegesis of the\nBible in the Opus expositionum et sermonum. The identification\nof the transcendentals with God, which is Eckhart\u2019s version of\nthe doctrine of God as first known, the doctrine of analogy, and the\ninclusion of spiritual perfections, such as justice and wisdom, among\nthe transcendentals, all betray the influence of Henry of Ghent.\n4.3 The third model: being as univocally common to God and creature (Duns Scotus)\n\n\nDuns Scotus (ca. 1266\u20131308) identifies the subject of metaphysics\nwith the first object of the intellect; since \u201call things\nnaturally knowable of God are transcendental,\u201d metaphysics\nincludes a consideration of the divine. Scotus formulates a new\nconception of transcendentality, according to which a transcendental\nhas no predicate above it except being. The consequence is that a\ntranscendental is not necessarily common: \u201cTherefore, it belongs\nto the meaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019 to have no predicate\nabove it but \u2018being\u2019; however, that it be common to many\ninferiors, is\n inessential.\u201d[4]\nThus, the range of the transcendental is extended.\nApart from the common notions, therefore, that are simply convertible\nwith the concept of \u2018being\u2019, like \u2018the one\u2019,\n\u2018the true\u2019, and \u2018the good\u2019, Duns Scotus admits\ndisjunctive transcendentals, i.e. transcendentals that are\ndisjunctively convertible with the concept of \u2018being\u2019, like\n\u2018infinite\u2019-\u2018finite\u2019,\n\u2018act\u2019-\u2018potency\u2019, etc. Finally, he also includes\n\u2018pure perfections\u2019, like \u2018wisdom\u2019, in the class\nof transcendentals and even claims that all transcendentals are called\n\u2018pure perfections\u2019 (perfectiones\nsimpliciter). The concept of being is a quidditative notion\nthat indicates the aptitude to exist and that is univocally predicated\nof God and creature, without \u2013 and this is the major innovation\nhere \u2013 positing a reality common to them. Between\n\u2018being\u2019 and the convertible transcendentals, like\n\u2018the one\u2019, there is a so-called formal\ndistinction: without being different things from being, \u2018the\none\u2019, \u2018the true\u2019, and \u2018the good\u2019 are\ndistinct from being and from each other by a different formality.\nBetween \u2018being\u2019 and the disjunctive transcendental\n properties, there is a modal distinction.[5]\nScotus applies the theory of the\n\u2018intension and remission of forms\u2019 to the transcendentals\n(which introduces degrees of perfection in the transcendentals); hence,\nthe common concept of \u2018being\u2019 and the proper concept of\n\u2018infinite being\u2019 are distinguished as a reality and its\nproper and intrinsic mode. (See Wolter 1946 & Dumont 1992.)\n\n\nThe Scotist school in the early fourteenth century discusses and\nextends Scotus\u2019 major innovations: the new conception of\ntranscendentality, which separates transcendentality from commonness\nand leads to the introduction of \u2018degrees of\ntranscendentality\u2019, the univocity of being, and the explanation\nof the non-identity of the transcendentals by a distinction that is not\nmerely conceptual.\n5. Transcendentals as First Objects of the Intellect\n\n\nAn important aspect of the transcendentals is that they are the\nfirst in a cognitive respect. Medieval authors frequently indicate the\nwhole group of transcendental concepts as first conceptions, although\nin a strict sense only the concept of \u2018being\u2019 is the first\nknown, to which the other transcendental determinations add their\nproper characteristics. As already Ibn Sina remarked \u2013 to whom\nthe theoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals owed the very\nidea of first conceptions \u2013 these notions cannot be defined by\nsome higher genus and must, therefore, be self-evident. They are made\nknown by a conceptual analysis (resolutio) that leads to the\nmost common as first known, which the synthetical construction of\nknowledge takes as its starting point. What is uncovered in this way is\nsomething implicitly present in all cognition, as the formal condition\nof all knowledge.\n\n\nThis aspect was brought to the fore by Thomas Aquinas in what has\ncome to be known as \u2018the objective turn\u2019. In his commentary\non Boethius\u2019 De trinitate, Aquinas advances the thesis\nthat \u201cto each [cognitive] power, its proper object is first\nknown\u201d (Super Boethium De trinitate, q. 1, art.\n3). Since what specifies a cognitive power is its proper object \u2013\ni.e. the formal aspect under which something is represented by that\npower \u2013, the identification of the first known with the proper\nobject of the intellect presents a significant claim. What is first in\nthe order of conceptual cognition is most common and self-evident not\nby accident, for it indicates the formal aspect of intelligibility,\nwhich is included in all knowledge and about which the intellect cannot\nbe uncertain. As such, it indicates the horizon of cognition. This\npromotion of a most common element of knowledge to the very horizon of\nknowledge, which was broadly acknowledged in the medieval debate on the\nfirst known, turned the medieval debate into a critique of\nknowledge.\n\n\nIn reaction to the early Franciscan doctrine of God as first known\n(Guibert of Tournai, Bonaventure), Aquinas distinguished between a\nresolution that leads to what is first and better known in itself (God\nas the first cause) and a resolution that leads to what is first and\nbetter known for us, being in general. In the Summa\ntheologiae, Aquinas even more radically calls the \u2018essence\nof things material\u2019 (quiditas rei materialis)\nthe proper object of the human mind; the point is that man in this life\nhas no knowledge of the essence of immaterial things, which make it\nimpossible that God be known first. Henry of Ghent reinstates the\ndoctrine of God as first known. His theological transformation of the\nfirst concepts, i.e. the priority he accords to the divine over the\ncreaturely within the transcendental concepts as such, makes God\u2019s\nquiddity the first known in natural cognition, only unconsciously and\nindeterminately conceived. Against both Thomas Aquinas and Henry of\nGhent, John Duns Scotus formulated his distribution of the first object\nof the intellect. He distinguishes three orders of intelligibility,\neach of which has its own first object: the order of origin,\nthe order of perfection and the order of adequation.\nThe first adequate object of the intellect is commensurate to\nthe intellective power and indicates the scope of human reason. Neither\nfinite (Aquinas: the essence of material things) nor infinite being\n(Henry of Ghent: God) are the first adequate object of human\nunderstanding, but the concept \u2018being\u2019 that is indifferent\nto finite and infinite being and is univocally common to God\nand\n creature.[6]\n\n\nApart from the thesis that God is first known, the medieval debate\npresented also other positions that challenged the cognitive primacy of\nbeing. On the one hand, the conceptualists: thinkers like Peter of\nAuriol and William of Ockham denied that what is first by commonness,\n\u201cbeing\u201d, would be the adequate \u201cmoving object\u201d\nof the intellect, for something common cannot move the intellect nor\ncause an intellectual cognition. The adequate moving object is the\n\u201cproper entity\u201d of a thing (Peter Auriol) or the singular\nas singular (Ockham). This thesis of the singular as first known was\nerected upon the important distinction between intuitive and\nabstractive cognition. On the other hand, some authors claimed that\nsomething more common than \u201cbeing\u201d is first known. Here,\nall early medieval forerunners of the super-transcendental play a role,\nlike the early Scotists (Nicolas Bonetus, Francis of Marchia) and other\nthinkers like Walter Burley and John Baconthorpe. They object to the\nprimacy of being that the notion is not commensurate to the scope of\nintelligibility; something else that transcends the realm of real being\nand that is common to real being and being of reason, e.g. the concept\nof \u2018thing\u2019 or \u2018something\u2019, is truly the first\nadequate object of the\n intellect.[7]\n6. Transcendentals and Metaphysics\n\n\nWe have noticed that, as medieval doctrines of the transcendentals\nexplain the relation between \u2018being\u2019 and the other\ntranscendental predicates in the predicative model of subject and\nproperty, they obeyed the basic structure of a science and hence gave a\nconcrete elaboration to metaphysics as the science of being as being.\nWe have also noticed that the medieval doctrines of the transcendentals\nfollowed Ibn Sina\u2019s rejection of the theological interpretation\nof the subject of metaphysics and grounded their ontological\ninterpretation of the subject of this science on the identification of\nbeing as the subject of metaphysics and being as first known. As a\nconsequence, the medieval conception of metaphysics was transformed.\nMetaphysics became the \u2018common science\u2019, the\n\u2018transcendental science\u2019, and \u2018first\nphilosophy\u2019 in a new sense. (See Aertsen 2012, 672\u20133.) (i.) The\nscience of being as being that is common to all things was founded by\nIbn Sina on \u2018common being\u2019 as its subject; Thomas Aquinas\naccordingly takes \u2018being in general\u2019 (ens\ncommune) as the subject of metaphysics and makes this science\nthe \u2018common science\u2019 (scientia communis).\n(ii.) Already in the Metaphysics-commentary of Albert the\nGreat, the science of metaphysics is said to deal with the \u2018first\nand transcendental (determinations)\u2019 (prima et\ntranscendentia). Duns Scotus completes this interpretation of\nmetaphysics, by declaring it the \u2018transcendental science\u2019\n(scientia transcendens). (iii) Whereas Aristotle\nfounded the primacy of metaphysics as first philosophy on the nobility\nof the objects it was concerned with, i.e. the highest causes, the\nmedieval foundation of being as the subject of metaphysics on being as\nthe first known generated an entirely new interpretation of the primacy\nof metaphysics: this science is first, because it deals with the first\nconceptions of the mind. Whereas Aristotle\u2019s first philosophy was\nthe most difficult science to learn, metaphysics as the medieval first\nphilosophy is the easiest of sciences, since it deals with the\nself-evident. (cf. Bonetus, Metaph. 2, c. 7)\n\n\nThe relation of doctrines of the transcendentals to the science of\nmetaphysics rests on the recognition that the transcendentals are\nproperties of being qua being, i.e. the basic features of reality.\nHowever, the epistemological aspect of doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, i.e. their status as the first, primitive conceptions\nof the intellect, implicitly compromises the real character of the\ntranscendental properties of being, given that what can be conceived\nexceeds the realm of what is real. Since the identity of the subject of\nfirst philosophy with the first object of the intellect was\nfoundational for the medieval conception of metaphysics, a basic\ninstability underlies the medieval conception of metaphysics and hence\nthe doctrines of the transcendentals: being as the first object of the\nintellect goes beyond the extension of real being as the subject of\nmetaphysics. (See Goris 2008 & 2011) This instability is\nwitnessed by the work of two Scotists in the early 14th century:\nNicolas Bonetus and Francis of Marchia.\n\n\nNicolas Bonetus places the doctrine of the formalities at the center\nof a new, and systematically elaborated, science of metaphysics, which\nfocuses on the doctrine of the transcendentals and reserves the\nconsideration of the divine to natural theology. Bonetus considers the\nconcept of being, insofar as it is univocal to real being and being in\nthe mind, as the subject of metaphysics. From this univocal concept of\nbeing, which signifies some determinate intelligible content distinct\nfrom other intelligible contents, he distinguishes an all-encompassing\nnotion of being which signifies \u201ceverything positive which is\noutside of nothing, whether it is real being, or being in the mind,\nwhether categorical, reducible to categories, or outside of all\ncategories.\u201d The consequence is that \u2018being\u2019 as the\nsubject of metaphysics, as a determinate formality distinct from other\nquiddities, is dissociated from the first object of the intellect, and\nconvertible with the transcendental properties \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019 only according to a\ndiminished degree of transcendentality. A comparable tendency can be\nwitnessed in the thought of Francis of Marchia. In answering the\nquestion concerning the first intention of a thing, Francis\ndistinguishes between a material and formal priority of concepts. The\nconcept of \u2018thing\u2019 (res) is the first concept in\nthe sense of material priority, which is related to the priority of the\nsubject of metaphysics. The concept of \u2018something\u2019\n(aliquid) is the first concept in the sense of formal\npriority, which is related to the priority of the object of the\nintellect. The dissociation of the subject of metaphysics and the first\nobject of the intellect is squared with the dissociation of a general\nmetaphysics, which deals with the transcendentals and builds the road\ntoward a special metaphysics, which deals with the divine. (See\nFolger-Fonfara 2008.)\n\n\nIn the light of these and later divisions of the science of\nmetaphysics, Suarez\u2019 project in the Disputationes\nmetaphysicae is to be considered a defense of the unity of\nmetaphysics, which nevertheless prolongs the dissociation that caused\nthese divisions. (See Darge 2004). Suarez distinguishes between being\nas the first object of the intellect and being as the proper subject of\nmetaphysics: \u201cbeing insofar as it is real being.\u201d This\nmakes it clear, finally, that the characteristic foundation of medieval\nmetaphysics, i.e. the identity of the subject of first philosophy with\nthe first object of the intellect, did not lead, despite its basic\ninstability, to a \u2018super-transcendental\u2019 metaphysics;\ninstead of sacrificing the realist understanding of metaphysics, the\nmedieval theoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals attacked\nthe identity of the subject of first philosophy with the first object\nof the intellect. Underlying the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals from Aquinas to Su\u00e1rez, therefore, is the\nrealist understanding of metaphysics as a \u2018science of the\nreal\u2019 (scientia realis).\n7. The Transcendental \u2018One\u2019\n\n\nThe place of the concept of unity in the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals is determined by two defining moments in particular:\n(i.) the relation between transcendental and categorical unity, or\nmetaphysical and mathematical unity, i.e. the one as the principle of\nnumber; (ii.) the integration of the (Neo-)Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions of thought on unity.\n\n\nAlready in Aristotle, the assertion of the transgeneric character of\nthe one, that runs through the categories in the same way as the\nconcept of \u2018being\u2019, and hence is convertible with it, is\nlinked with the designation of \u2018indivisibility\u2019 as the\nproper meaning of unity, and is connected with the categorical one: it\nis \u201cthe first measure of a kind, and above all of quantity; for\nit is from this that it has been extended to the other\ncategories.\u201d (Aristotle, Metaph. X, c. 1, 1052 b 18\u201319.) In his\nmost influential, yet highly controversial elaboration on the concept\nof unity, Ibn Sina agrees with Aristotle that \u2018one\u2019 is\nco-extensional with \u2018being\u2019 and differs from it in its\nconcept; he adds, however, that just like being, unity is not part of\nthe substance of a thing, and hence accidental in the sense of\nextra-essential, a feature that he combines with its being accidental\nin the sense of being the principle of number in the category of\nquantity. Already Ibn Rushd criticized Ibn Sina for this confusion of\nthe metaphysical \u2018one\u2019 with the mathematical\n\u2018one\u2019. The different reactions in the Latin medieval\ndoctrines of the transcendentals reflect the differences in their\ninternal systematics. Aquinas accuses Ibn Sina of being deceived by the\nequivocity of the one, confusing the one that is convertible with being\nand the one that is the principle of number. The point for Aquinas is\nthat the one that is convertible with being adds only something\nconceptual to being, i.e. the negation of division; whereas the one\nthat is the principle of number adds something real, i.e. the relation\nto a measure, as a consequence of which the extension of the concept of\nbeing is narrowed down to the category of quantity. Duns Scotus,\nhowever, agrees with the position that he ascribes to Ibn Sina, namely\nthat being and the one are not essentially convertible, and therewith\nexpresses the major divergence of his doctrine of the transcendentals,\nin which the transcendentals do not add merely something conceptual to\n\u2018being\u2019, but something really distinct, in the sense in\nwhich a property is really distinct from the subject. The argument,\nhowever, that Duns Scotus provides for his position, namely the\nobservation that if \u2018being\u2019 and \u2018one\u2019 were\nessentially convertible, then multitude would be devoid of reality, is\nloyal to a major inspiration of Aquinas\u2019 reflection on\ntranscendental unity. Aquinas is also concerned to grant a positive\nmeaning to multitude and even accords a transcendental dimension to\nmultitude.\n\n\nAlthough the positive appreciation of multitude in medieval\ndoctrines of the transcendentals stands in clear contrast to the\nNeoplatonic reflection on the \u2018One\u2019, these doctrines tried\nto synthesize the Platonic and the Aristotelian traditions of\nspeculation on unity, the so-called henological and ontological\ntraditions, by integrating the transcendental and the transcendent\ndimensions of the \u2018one\u2019. This integration becomes evident\nin the doctrines of the transcendentals formulated by Aquinas and\nMeister Eckhart, and in Renaissance-Platonism, e.g. the treatise De\nente et uno by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. This same\nNeoplatonic tradition also inspired, however, a major critique of the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals, as formulated in the commentary of\nBerthold of Moosburg on the Elementatio theologica of\nProclus and in the works of Nicolas of Cusa.\n8. The Transcendental \u2018True\u2019\n\n\nIn the same way as the reflection on the concept of unity in\nmedieval doctrines of the transcendentals envisaged to articulate a\nmore fundamental feature of unity underneath the mathematical\nconception of unity, their investigation into the transcendental notion\nof truth uncovered a basic feature of reality, prior to and explicative\nof its logical dimension as a property of propositions.\n\n\nWhat is a basic tension in Aristotle\u2019s affirmations concerning\nthe relation between being and the true, i.e. the tension between the\nassertion that each thing is related to truth in the same way as it is\nto being and the assertion that being-as-true (ens ut\nverum) is a kind of intramental being that falls outside the\nscience of metaphysics, is part of a synthesizing program in\nAnselm\u2019s treatise De veritate, where the propositional\ntruth, ontological truth, and moral truth are all explained, in an\nintegrative effort, under the aegis of the basic concept of\n\u2018rightness\u2019 (rectitudo). Anselm\u2019s definition\nwas important in early attempts in the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals to relate the true that is convertible with being with\nthe truth of the proposition. Gradually, the definition of truth as the\n\u2018conformity of the thing with the intellect\u2019\n(adaequatio rei et intellectus) rose to hegemony,\nwhich has the advantage of making explicit the constitutive relation\nwith the intellect, but threatens to make transcendental truth depend\nupon actual cognition.\n\n\nIn De ver. 1.1, Aquinas presents his analysis of the\nconcept of truth in a threefold scheme, according to which there is a\nmoment of conformity of intellect and thing, right between the thing as\nthe foundation of truth and knowledge as its result; this conformity,\nin which the meaning of the true is formally accomplished, is\ntranscendental truth. In contrast to this, in the Summa theol.\nAquinas uses a twofold scheme, according to which the intellect is true\nin a primary sense, the thing only in a secondary sense, namely in\nrelation to the intellect; the aptness of the\n\u2018adaequatio\u2019-formula is that it comprises both\nsenses. In the development of Aquinas\u2019 reflection on truth\nbetween De ver. and the Summa theol., therefore, an\nelimination of the intermediary moment occurs, a merging of\ntranscendental truth with the truth of cognition, which has been\ninterpreted as a dissolution of transcendental truth. (See Dewan\n2004.)\n\n\nThe fundamental dimension of transcendental truth as an openness of\nbeing in its intelligibility to cognition, which Aquinas had identified\nin De ver., is also clearly expressed in Duns Scotus\u2019\nreflection on truth in his commentary on the sixth book of the\nMetaphysics. After having declared that all truth related to\nthe divine intellect is studied by metaphysics, he continues to\ndistinguish three senses in which the human mind is related to truth,\nof which only the first is studied by metaphysics: namely when a thing\nis said to be true because it is able to manifest itself to an\nintellect capable of perceiving it, of which Scotus explicitly says\nthat it is convertible with being. The other senses, according to which\na thing is true because it is assimilated to or known by the human\nintellect, fall outside the scope of metaphysics and belong to\nlogic.\n\n\nIn response to the same tension that motivated Aquinas to give more\nemphasis to the intellect in the definition of transcendental truth,\nthe transcendental true was advanced to claim conceptual precedence\nbefore and hence challenge the conceptual priority of the concept of\nbeing. Potencies are specified by the formal aspect under which they\nconceive things and the intellect is distinguished from the will, since\nthe formal object of the former is the true, the formal object of the\nlatter is the good. On account of \u2018the objective turn\u2019, the\nidentification of the first known with the proper object, it is clear,\ntherefore, that the true is in a sense the first known, as the formal\naspect under which everything is understood by the intellect. Henry of\nGhent is the main representative of this much-discussed position. He\ndistinguishes between the true as what is \u2018dispositively\u2019\nfirst known, in the sense of what is conditional for knowledge, and\nbeing as what is \u2018objectively\u2019 first known. This\ndistinction respects the difference between direct and reflective\ncognition, but also shows the vulnerability of the medieval foundation\nof the priority of the concept of being. It might be taken as another\nexample of the basic instability that underlies the doctrines of the\ntranscendentals: the non-identity of the first object of the intellect\nand the subject of metaphysics.\n9. The Transcendental \u2018Good\u2019\n\n\nWhereas the transcendental \u2018true\u2019 imposes its\ndifficulties to qualify as a property of being as being, the indication\nof which was Aristotle\u2019s exclusion of being of reason from\nmetaphysics, the transcendental \u2018good\u2019 raises the suspicion\nof a naturalistic fallacy, by making the ethical good depend upon the\ngood as a property convertible with being. In a sense, the same\ndifficulty presents itself with all the transcendental properties: the\nmetaphysical explication of the concept of \u2018being\u2019\n(ens) in the \u2018most common notions\u2019\n(communissima), \u2018one\u2019 (unum),\n\u2018true\u2019 (verum), and \u2018good\u2019\n(bonum), competes with the consideration of these notions in\nanother science, in which they are principal: the one in mathematics,\nthe true in logic, and the good in ethics.\n\n\nThe metaphysics of the good, as it is conceived in the thesis of the\nconvertibility of the good and being in the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, was central in the early elaboration of the doctrine.\nIts central inspiration was Aristotle\u2019s critique on Plato\u2019s\nIdea of the Good in the first book of the Nicomachean\nEthics, which proclaimed the transgeneric and analogical\ncharacter of the good and opened with an authoritative definition:\n\u201cthe good is that which all desire.\u201d (Arist., Eth. Nic. I,\nc. 1, 1094a2\u20133) Medieval authors could rely on Boethius\u2019 De\nhebdomadibus for an explanation of the goodness of reality, which\nbuilds basically on its being created by what is essentially good; the\ntreatise is an exemplary harmonization of the Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions, which assert the transcendence resp. the transcendentality\nof the good. Another important argument to account for the\nconvertibility of being and good is found in Aquinas, who connects the\nactuality of being with the proper character of the good as that which\nis desirable \u2013 since a thing is desirable only insofar as it is\nperfect, and is only perfect insofar as it is in act, the goodness of a\nthing depends on the actuality of its being. Aquinas\u2019 doctrine of\nthe transcendentals also provides a major model to think of the\nrelation between the metaphysical and the moral good, insofar as it is\nfoundational not only for the realm of theoretical reason, but also for\nthe realm of practical reason. In the same way as the first principle\nin theoretical reason, the principle of non-contradiction, is founded\non the concept of \u2018being\u2019 as first known in the theoretical\nrealm, the first principle in practical reason, the first precept of\nnatural law: \u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and evil\navoided,\u201d is founded on the concept of \u2018good\u2019 as\nfirst known in the practical realm. (See Kluxen 1964, 93\u2013100, &\nAertsen 1996, 326\u2013330.)\n\n\nInterestingly, the metaphysics of the good, which had been central\nin the early elaboration of the doctrine of the transcendentals, seems\nto have lost some of its appeal in the wake of a new concept of being.\nAlthough Henry of Ghent organizes his treatise on the good in\nSumma 41.1 in accordance with Aquinas\u2019 discussion of the\ngood in De ver. 21.1, the essentialist interpretation of the\nconcept of being that he established had only limited possibilities,\nand even less impulse, to account for the fundamental difference\nbetween the transcendental good and moral perfections. In Duns Scotus,\nthe good is an absolute property formally distinct from being; in\nSuarez, \u2018the good\u2019 primarily signifies the perfection of a\nthing, while adding the aspect of suitability (convenientia),\ni.e. it connotes a nature having a natural inclination, capacity, or\nconjunction with such perfection.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aristotle, <em>Metaphysica</em>.
