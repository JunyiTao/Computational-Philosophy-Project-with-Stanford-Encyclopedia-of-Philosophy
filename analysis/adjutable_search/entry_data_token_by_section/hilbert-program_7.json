    "main_text": "The Finitary Point of View || Finitary operations and finitary proof\n2.3 Finitary operations and finitary proof\n\nOf crucial importance to both an understanding of finitism and of\nHilbert\u2019s proof theory is the question of what operations and\nwhat principles of proof should be allowed from the finitist\nstandpoint. That a general answer is necessary is clear from the\ndemands of Hilbert\u2019s proof theory, i.e., it is not to be\nexpected that given a formal system of mathematics (or even a single\nsequence of formulas) one can \u201csee\u201d that it is consistent\n(or that it cannot be a genuine derivation of an inconsistency) the\nway we can see, e.g., that \\(11 + 111 = 111 + 11\\). What is required\nfor a consistency proof is an operation which, given a formal\nderivation, transforms such a derivation into one of a special form,\nplus proofs that the operation in fact does this and that proofs of\nthe special kind cannot be proofs of an inconsistency. To count as a\nfinitary consistency proof, the operation itself must be acceptable\nfrom the finitist standpoint, and the proofs required must use only\nfinitarily acceptable principles.\n\nHilbert never gave a general account of which operations and methods\nof proof are acceptable from the finitist standpoint, but only\nexamples of operations and methods of inference in contentual finitary\nnumber theory which he accepted as finitary. Contentual induction was\naccepted in its application to finitary statements of the\nhypothetical, general kind explicitly in\n Hilbert (1922b).\n He\n (1923,\n 1139) said that intuitive thought \u201cincludes recursion and\nintuitive induction for finite existing totalities,\u201d and used\nexponentiation in an example in\n 1928.\n Bernays (1930) explained \nhow exponentiation may be understood as a\nfinitary operation on numerals.\n Hilbert and Bernays (1934)\n give the only general account of finitary contentual number theory;\naccording to it, operations defined by primitive recursion and proofs\nusing induction are finitarily acceptable. All of these methods can be\nformalized in a system known as primitive recursive arithmetic\n(\\(\\PRA\\)), which allows definitions of functions by primitive\nrecursion and induction on quantifier-free formulas (ibid.). However,\nneither Hilbert nor Bernays ever claimed that only primitive\nrecursive operations count as finitary, and they in fact did use some\nnon-primitive recursive methods in ostensibly finitary consistency\nproofs already in 1923 (see\n Tait 2002\n and\n Zach 2003).\n\nThe more interesting conceptual issue is which operations\nshould be considered as finitary. Since Hilbert was less than\ncompletely clear on what the finitary standpoint consists in, there is\nsome leeway in setting up the constraints, epistemological and\notherwise, an analysis of finitist operation and proof must fulfill.\nHilbert characterized (see above) the objects of finitary number\ntheory as \u201cintuitively given,\u201d as \u201csurveyable in all\ntheir parts,\u201d and said that their having basic properties must\n\u201cexist intuitively\u201d for us.\n Bernays (1922, 216)\n suggests that in finitary mathematics, only \u201cprimitive\nintuitive cognitions come into play,\u201d and uses the term\n\u201cpoint of view of intuitive evidence\u201d in connection with\nfinitism\n 1930,\n 250. This characterization of finitism as primarily to do with\nintuition and intuitive knowledge has been emphasized in\nparticular by\n (Parsons, 1998)\n who argues that what can count as finitary on this understanding is\nnot more than those arithmetical operations that can be defined from\naddition and multiplication using bounded recursion. In particular,\naccording to him, exponentiation and general primitive recursion are\nnot finitarily acceptable.\n\nThe thesis that finitism coincides with primitive recursive reasoning\nhas received a forceful defense by\n (Tait 1981;\n see also\n 2002,\n 2005b,\n 2019).\n Tait, in contrast to Parsons, rejects the aspect of representability\nin intuition as the hallmark of the finitary; instead he takes\nfinitary reasoning to be \u201ca minimal kind of reasoning\npresupposed by all non-trivial mathematical reasoning about\nnumbers.\u201d and analyzes finitary operations and methods of proof\nas those that are implicit in the very notion of number as the form of\na finite sequence. This analysis of finitism is supported by\nHilbert\u2019s contention that finitary reasoning is a precondition\nfor logical and mathematical, indeed any scientific thinking\n Hilbert (1931b, 267).\n Since finitary reasoning is that part of mathematics which is\npresupposed by all non-trivial reasoning about numbers, it is, so\nTait, \u201cindubitable\u201d in a Cartesian sense, and this\nindubitability as all that would be required of finitary reasoning to\nprovide the epistemological grounding of mathematics Hilbert intended\nit for.\n\nAnother interesting analysis of finitary proof, which, however, does\nnot provide as detailed a philosophical justification, was proposed by\n Kreisel (1960).\n It yields the result that exactly those functions are finitary which\ncan be proved to be total in first-order arithmetic \\(\\PA\\). It is\nbased on the proof-theoretic concept of a reflection principle; see\n Zach (2006)\n for more detail and\n Dean (2015)\n for an analysis.\n Kreisel (1970, Section 3.5)\n provides another analysis by focusing on what is\n\u201cvisualizable.\u201d The result is the same: finitary\nprovability turns out to be coextensive with provability in\n\\(\\PA\\).\n\nTait\u2019s technical analysis yields that the finitistic functions\nare exactly the primitive recursive ones, and the finitistic\nnumber-theoretic truths are exactly those provable in the theory of\nprimitive recursive arithmetic \\(\\PRA.\\) It is important to stress\nthat this analysis is not carried out from within the finitist\nviewpoint itself. Since the general notions of \u201cfunction\u201d\nand \u201cproof\u201d are not themselves finitary, the finitist is\nunable to make sense of Tait\u2019s thesis that everything provable\nin \\(\\PRA\\) is finitistically true. According to Tait, a proper\nanalysis of finitistic provability must not assume that finitism\nitself has access to such non-finitistic notions. Kreisel\u2019s\napproach and some criticisms of Tait that rely on reflection\nprinciples or \\(\\omega\\)-rules run afoul of this requirement (see Tait\n 2002,\n 2005b). On the other hand, one could argue that \\(\\PRA\\) is too\nstrong a theory to count as a formalization of what is\n\u201cpresupposed by all non-trivial mathematical reasoning about\nnumbers\u201d: there are weaker but non-trivial theories which are\nrelated to smaller classes of functions than the primitive recursive\nones, such as \\(\\PV\\) and \\(\\EA\\), related to the polynomial-time and\nKalmar-elementary functions respectively (see\n Avigad 2003\n on how much mathematics can be carried out in \\(\\EA)\\). Using an\nanalysis along the same lines as Tait\u2019s,\n Ganea (2010)\n has arrived at the corresponding class of Kalmar-elementary functions\nas those that are finitistic. See also\n Incurvati (2019)\n for further analysis of different notions of finitism.\n",
