    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Mathematical Facts\n1.8 Mathematical Facts\nMathematics raises many of the same issues for ontological\nnaturalism as morality. Mathematical claims typically involve a\ncommitment to abstract objects like numbers and sets, eternal entities\noutside space and time. This might seem cogent at first sight, but\nonce more epistemological difficulties quickly arise. Abstract objects\ncan have no effects in the spatiotemporal world. How then can\nspatiotemporal being like ourselves come to know about them?\nHowever the mathematical case does not fully parallel the moral\none.  One of the options in the moral case was naturalist realism,\nwhich reads moral claims as about natural facts which play causal\nroles in the spatiotemporal world. However, given the explicit\ncommitment of mathematical claims to abstract objects without\nspatiotemporal location, this option does not seem available in the\nmathematical case (but see Maddy 1990). So we seem required to choose\nbetween non-naturalist realism about non-spatiotemporal mathematical\nentities or naturalist irrealism.\nAs in the moral case, non-naturalist realism faces epistemological\nchallenges, to which one response is to posit a\nfaculty of intuition which gives us access to the abstract\nmathematical realm.  Kurt G\u00f6del arguably favoured a view along\nthese lines (Parsons 1995). However, once more this only seems to push\nthe problem back.  There seems no good way for the posited faculty to\nbridge the causal gap between the abstract and the spatiotemporal\nrealms without generating implausible overdetermination.\nAn alternative version of non-naturalist realism aims to vindicate\nmathematical and modal claims as essential parts of our best overall\ntheories of the world. According to this line of thought, defended by\nHilary Putnam, our empirically best-supported scientific theories\ncommit us to mathematical entities; ergo, we are entitled to believe\nin such entities (Putnam \n1971).[10]\nHowever, it is contentious whether our best-supported empirical\ntheories do commit us to abstract mathematical entities. The most\nprominent version of naturalist irrealism about mathematics, Hartry\nField\u2019s fictionalism, disputes precisely this claim. According\nto Field, we can construct \u201cnominalist\u201d\nversions of scientific theories that avoid commitment to abstract\nmathematical objects yet are explanatorily\nsuperior to the \u201cplatonist\u201d alternatives. Field argues\nthat we do not have to regard mathematics itself as literally true in\norder to understand its use in science and other applications. Rather\nit can be viewed as a \u201cuseful fiction\u201d which facilitates\ninferences between nominalistic scientific claims, but is not itself\nimplicated in our most serious beliefs about the world (Field 1980,\n1989).\nNot all philosophers of mathematics are convinced that Fieldian\nnominalizations are available to replace all scientific references to\nabstract mathematical objects. In particular, some have argued that\ncertain explanations of nominalist facts make essential reference to\nabstract objects (Baker 2005, Batterman 2010). In response, others\nhave sought to show that there are in fact good nominalist\nexplanations of the facts in question (Daly and Langford 2009,\nButterfield 2011, Menon and Callender 2013). In any case, it is not\nclear that Field\u2019s metaphysical stance requires a full execution\nof his nominalizing programme, as opposed to a case for its cogency:\ndifficulties in constructing nominalist theories can always be\nattributed to limitations of human ingenuity rather than the reality\nof abstract mathematical objects (Leng 2013).\nPerhaps the most popular contemporary alternative to fictionalism\nis the version of non-naturalist realism offered by the neo-Fregean\nthesis that abstract mathematical beliefs can be justified as analytic\ntruths that follow from logic and certain meaning stipulations. The\nidea has been most fully developed in connection with arithmetic,\nwhere Crispin Wright has shown how Peano\u2019s postulates can be\nderived within the framework of second-order logic from nothing except\nthe Humean principle that the same number attaches to equinumerous\nconcepts.  According to Wright, this principle can be viewed as an\nimplicit definition of our concept of number. If this is right, then\nit has indeed been shown that arithmetic, and therewith the existence\nof numbers as abstract objects, follows from logic and definition\nalone (Wright 1983, Hale and Wright 2003). There has also been some\nattempt to extend the programme to mathematical analysis (Shapiro\n2000, Wright 2000).\nOne query that might be put to this programme is whether the Humean\nprinciple and analogous assumptions can really be viewed as analytic\ndefinitions. If they commit us to numbers and other abstract objects\nwhose existence cannot established without them, then they are\narguably doing more than definitions should. A related issue is\nwhether the overall neo-Fregean position is properly viewed as\nrealist. From its perspective, the role of abstract mathematical\nobjects in the overall scheme of things seems to be exhausted by their\nmaking our mathematical statements true; given this, it might seem\nbetter to classify it as a species of irrealism (MacBride 2003).\nTo complete this discussion of ontological naturalism, let us\nbriefly consider the realm of modality, understood as the subject\nmatter of claims that answer to something more than\nactuality. Modality raises many of the same issues as mathematics, but\nthe topic is complicated by the prior question of the content of modal\nclaims, and in particular about whether they quantify over non-actual\npossible worlds. Whereas there is little dispute about the initial\nsemantic analysis of mathematical claims\u2014they purport to refer\nto abstract numbers, sets, functions and so on\u2014there is somewhat\nless unanimity about the possible worlds analysis of modal claims\n(Nolan 2011b).\nTo the extent that modal claims do quantify over possible worlds,\nthe ontological points made about mathematics apply well here too.\nSince non-actual worlds do not inhabit our spatiotemporal realm, an\nontologically naturalist realism seems to be ruled out from the\nstart.  The remaining alternatives are irrealism or non-naturalist\nrealism. The former alternative has been explored in recent years by\nmodal fictionalists (Rosen 1990; Nolan 2011a). The options under\nthe latter heading meet the same epistemological challenges as in\nthe mathematical case: brute intuition faces causal problems; it is\ncontentious whether we should take our best scientific theories to\ncommit us to possible worlds; and, if modal knowledge is to be\nanalytically a priori, on the model of mathematical\nneo-Fregeanism, then it is not obvious that it can take us to\nknowledge of possible worlds construed realistically.  \n",
