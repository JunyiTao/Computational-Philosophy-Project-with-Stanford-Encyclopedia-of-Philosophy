    "main_text": "Singularity, consciousness and horizon-intentionality\n4. Singularity, consciousness and horizon-intentionality\n\nHusserl sees quite clearly that indexical experiences (just as\nexperiences given voice to by means of genuine proper names) are\ncharacterized, among other things, by their singularity: they\nrepresent a particular object, or set of objects, x, such\nthat x is to be regarded as the intentional object of the\nrespective experience in all relevant possible worlds (i.e., in all\nactual or counterfactual circumstances relative to which we are\ndetermining the object represented by that experience). Thus, for\ninstance, in sec. 47 of Ideas, he describes what an\nexperiencing subject, at a given time, in the light of his (or her)\ncurrent indexical experiences, considers to be \u201cthe actual\nworld\u201d as a \u201cspecial case\u201d of a whole manifold of\n\u201cpossible worlds\u201d each of which corresponds to a possible\nfuture course of experience (possible, that is, relative to the\nindexical experience in question). These (actual or potential) future\nexperiences can be said to be (more or less) anticipated by the\nexperiencing subject at the respective time, and they constitute what\nHusserl calls the \u201cintentional horizon\u201d of the indexical\nexperience in the light of whose intentional content they are\nanticipated (cf. Smith and McIntyre 1982). For example, if you see\nsomething as a table, you will expect it to appear to you in certain\nways if you go around and observe it.\n\nWhat binds together the intentional horizon of a given indexical\nexperience? According to Husserl, all of the (actual or potential)\nexperiences constituting that horizon share a sense of identity\nthrough time, which sense he labels as the determinable\nX they belong to. As a first approximation, two experiences of a\ngiven subject belong to the same determinable X if and only\nif the subject believes them to represent the same object. (For a\nrelated criterion of intersubjective identity of determinable\nX, see Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Hence, experiences belonging to a\ndeterminable X must be accompanied by at least one\nhigher-order belief. This view fits in well with the thesis (shared,\nat least in part, by so-called dispositional higher-order belief\ntheories of consciousness) that intentional experiences automatically\ngive rise to (i.e., motivate) momentary dispositions to make\ncorresponding reflective higher-order judgements, based on something\nlike inner perception, thus constituting a form of implicit or\n\u201cpre-reflective self-consciousness\u201d (to use Sartre\u2019s\nterm).\n\nIt is controversial whether such a dispositional higher-order view may\nbe ascribed to Husserl (see Zahavi 2015, sec. 1; for a reply see Beyer\n2018, sec. 1). It should be uncontroversial that on his view the\nmotivational basis of the relevant higher-order dispositional beliefs\nmust already display the essential feature of consciousness\nindependently of occurrent higher-order thought in order to be\navailable for such thought in the first place (see Beyer 2011, p. 44).\nThis becomes clear on a close study of Husserl\u2019s work on\n\u201cinner time-consciousness\u201d (see the entry on\n phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness;\n also see Section 6 below). However, there is ample textual evidence\nshowing that he regards the availability to inner perception (in the\nsense of a \u201creal possibility\u201d or \u201cpractical\nability\u201d; see Section 8 below) and to accordingly motivated\nreflective higher-order judgements (in which a hitherto \u201clatent\nEgo\u201d becomes \u201cpatent\u201d) as an essential feature of\nconsciousness, constituting its \u201cmode of being\u201d (cf.\nHusserliana, vol. III/1, p. 77, l. 27\u201335; p. 95, l.\n36\u201338; Husserliana, vol. VIII, p. 90).\n\nThe determinable X a given indexical experience belongs to,\nwith respect to certain other experiences, helps us answer the\nquestion of what determines the reference of that experience, if not\nits ideal meaning species alone. In order to take the role played by\nthe determinable X into account properly, we have to employ a\nHusserlian research strategy that could be called the dynamic\nmethod. That is to say, we have to look upon intentional acts as\nmomentary components of certain transtemporal cognitive\nstructures\u2014dynamic intentional structures\u2014in\nwhich one and the same object or state of affairs is represented\nthroughout a period of time during which the subject\u2019s cognitive\nperspective upon that object or state of affairs is constantly\nchanging (see, e.g., Ideas, sec. 86). (Typical examples of\ndynamic intentional structures include continuous\nobservations\u2014which represent Husserl\u2019s standard\nexample\u2014as well as those totalities of successive judgements, or\nmomentary belief-states, that actualize one and the same continuous\nbelief. For instance, my judgement that yesterday was Thursday\nactualizes the same belief as the judgement I could have given voice\nto yesterday by \u201cToday is Thursday\u201d.) Consequently, the\ndeterminable X is apt to lead us back through time towards\nthe original situation where the reference of the relevant unified\nseries of successive intentional horizons was fixed, like for instance\nthe occasion of the subject\u2019s first perceptual encounter with a\nparticular object: the corresponding perceptual experience will belong\nto the same determinable X as all of the (remaining)\nexperiences belonging to the relevant series. In a more recent\nterminology, one may say that in this perceptual situation the subject\nhas opened a mental file about a particular object (cf. Perry\n1980).\n\nIn a research manuscript from 1913 Husserl refers to mental files\nassociated with proper names as \u201cindividual notions\n(Eigenbegriffe)\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol. XX/2,\np. 358), characterizing them as being infinitely \u201copen\u201d\nand \u201cin flux\u201d (cf. ibid., p. 359). Now it is the\n\u201creferent\u201d of the relevant mental file, or individual\nnotion, that will normally count as the common intentional object of\nthe experiences bound together in a unified series of successive\nintentional horizons in which the object \u201cconstitutes\nitself\u201d empirically. (In cases where the \u201creferent\u201d\nof a mental file changes across time\u2014i.e., is unnoticedly\nreplaced by another object\u2014the situation becomes more\ncomplicated. The same goes for cases of perceptual judgements leading\nto, or taken by the respective subject to be confirming, entries into\nan already existing file. See Beyer 2000, sec. 7.) Note that\n\u201cconstitution\u201d so conceived does not mean\ncreation.\n\nOn this reading of Husserl\u2019s notion of the determinable\nX, there is a link, at least in the case of proper names and\nin the ubiqituous indexical case, between intentional content\n(including determinable X) on the one hand, and extra-mental\nreality on the other, such that intentional content thus understood\ndetermines reference in much the same way more recent externalist\ntheories of content would have it, i.e. in such a way that the\nreferent can in turn be said to help determine the intentional content\n(see Beyer 2000, 2001; cf. also Husserl\u2019s discussion of Twin\nEarth in Husserliana, vol. XXVI, p. 212). Notice, however,\nthat Husserl does not naively take the existence of an extra-mental\nreferent for granted. Instead, he asks which structures of\nconsciousness entitle us to represent the world as containing\nparticular objects transcending what is currently given to us in\nexperience (see Sections 7 and 8 below).\n\nHusserl can thus be read (or at least be rationally reconstructed) as\nboth an early direct reference theorist (headword: singularity) and a\nnon-naive externalist about intentional content and (respective)\nmeaning.\n\nThe dynamic method has us look upon noematic Sinn under the\n\u201cfunctional aspect\u201d of how it enables us to keep the\nintentional object \u201cin mind (im Sinn)\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. II/1, pp. 196 ff), instead of viewing it\nmerely statically as a psychological type or species to be\ninstantiated by isolated moments of consciousness. It makes us regard\nany content of the latter sort, particularly \u201cstatic perceptual\ncontent\u201d, as a mere \u201cabstraction from dynamic\ncontent\u201d (Mulligan 1995, pp. 195, 197). This may help to explain\nwhy the species-theory of content had become less important to Husserl\nby the time he wrote Ideas.\n",
