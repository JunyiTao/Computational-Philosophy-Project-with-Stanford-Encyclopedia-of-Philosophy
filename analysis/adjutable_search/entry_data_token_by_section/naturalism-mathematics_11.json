    "main_text": "Motivating Naturalism\n4. Motivating Naturalism\n\n\nOne may simply adopt naturalism without providing an argument or\nmotivation for it. But motivations for naturalism buttress it, making\nit internally stronger, and give it dialectical strength, increasing\nits appeal to non-naturalists. They answer the fundamental question:\nwhy exactly those standards?\n\n\n(The same goes for naturalisms primarily conceived as approaches or\nstances rather than doctrines. Since the publication of her 1997 book,\nPenelope Maddy has clarified that her version of naturalism is a\nstance (Maddy 2001) or a piecemeal approach/method of inquiry (2007,\nsee e.g., p. 19 fn. 15, p. 403). However, stances and approaches to\ninquiry are attractive to the extent that they are well motivated.)\n",
