    "main_text": "Inner Speech and Thought || Inner Speech as Thought\n2.3 Inner Speech as Thought\n\nA number of philosophers have argued that at least some inner speech\nepisodes actually are thoughts or, at least, parts of thought\nprocesses. Gauker (2011, 2018) holds that all conceptual thought\noccurs in inner speech, where, as elaborated in\n Section 3.2,\n he takes inner speech to involve the tokening of items of a natural\nlanguage in neural states that are distinct from the auditory-verbal\nrepresentations that many identify with inner speech. In his 2011\nbook, he responds to arguments that conceptual thought cannot occur in\nnatural language.\n\nWith respect to inner speech understood as a partly sensory\nphenomenon, Keith Frankish (2018) describes how inner speech can be\nused to break a complicated problem into smaller problems, which can\nthen be addressed by lower level, automatic thought processes.\nDeciding whether to accept an invitation from colleagues to attend a\nparty, for example, one might produce the inner speech episode,\n\u201cWhat will it be like?\u201d. This more circumscribed question\ncan be addressed by autonomous processes, such as recalling previous\nparties with colleagues. Along with other autonomous processes, this\nmight generate the prediction that an annoying colleague, Henry, will\nlikely be at the party. If this is significant, it could result in the\ninner speech episode, \u201cHenry will probably be there\u201d, in\nturn prompting a largely autonomous evaluation of the effort involved\nin enduring Henry\u2019s company. The process could result, depending\non the outcome of this evaluation, in producing the inner speech\nepisode, \u201cI can\u2019t face that; I won\u2019t go\u201d.\n(Quotes from Frankish [2018: 234], though the example is slightly\nmodified.) The inner speech episodes, Frankish believes, are critical\nto making the decision, and are thus rightly considered parts of the\nprocess of thinking itself. See Kompa (forthcoming) for a similar\nargument; cf. Munroe (2022b), discussed above, who also holds that an\ninner speech episode can be essential to a thought process but does\nnot infer from this that an inner speech episode can actually be a\npart of the process, but see also discussion of Munroe (2023)\nbelow.\n\nFrankish (2018) also holds that inner speech episodes can be thoughts\nin the form of conscious commitments, where these are \u201ca\ndistinct kind of mental attitude\u201d (2018: 237), which cannot be\nanalyzed in terms of other conscious mental states, such as conscious\ndecisions, beliefs, or desires, or expressions of other mental states.\nThey are simply commitments made to oneself to \u201cregulat[e] our\nfuture activities, including our intentional reasoning, in line with\nthe choice or view expressed\u201d (2018: 237). For example, the\ninner speech episode, \u201cI will go to the gym today\u201d, is a\ncommitment to go to the gym today, not just the expression of a\ndecision to do so, because it also generates a kind of obligation to\noneself, as it were, to do so. For Frankish, this follows from\ntreating inner speech as an internalized version of interpersonal\nspeech, in which commitments also generate obligations.\n\nOn Frankish\u2019s account, an inner speech episode can be\nlike a judgment, insofar as it may involve committing oneself\nto act and reason in a way which is consistent with the truth of the\nproposition expressed by the inner speech episode. Munroe (2023), by\ncontrast, holds that an inner speech episode can actually function as\na judgment. If an inner speech episode is accompanied by what has been\ncalled a \u201cFeeling of Rightness\u201d (Munroe cites Thomson et\nal. 2013 and Unkelbach & Greifender 2013), then it will play roles\ntypically attributed to judgments such as \u201cterminating inquiry\nand causing overt actions\u201d (Munroe 2023: 309). Munroe connects\nhis claim to a model proposed by Ackerman & Thompson (2015, 2017a,\n2017b) on which the roles that mental states play is determined partly\nby metacognitive monitoring. The \u201cFeeling of Rightness\u201d is\na cue to a metacognitive monitoring system that a particular mental\nstate can appropriately play the roles of a judgment. Munroe\u2019s\nclaim is that inner speech episodes can function as judgments if this\nis deemed appropriate by the metacognitive monitoring system, on\naccount of being accompanied by the appropriate \u201cFeeling of\nRightness\u201d (or at least by a feeling of sufficient\ncertainty).\n\nNikola Kompa (forthcoming) adds a quite different argument for the\nidentity of (some) thoughts and (some) inner speech episodes. She\noperates with a broad notion of inner speech, on which any\n\u201cinner episode that substantially engages the speech production\nsystem\u201d is an instance of inner speech (forthcoming: 4, emphasis\nremoved). On this understanding of inner speech, any thought with\nsemantic content and syntactic structure will be an instance of inner\nspeech, even if it does not become conscious. Kompa rejects the\nlanguage of thought hypothesis, on which thoughts can have linguistic\nproperties because they occur in a non-natural language. Accordingly,\nfor Kompa, the only way that a thought can have semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure is if its formation substantially\ninvolves the speech production system (which she understands in\nLeveltian terms, citing Levelt 1989; Levelt et al. 1999; and Indefrey\n& Levelt 2004). Insofar as we have any thoughts that have semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure, then, these are, on her definition,\ninstances of inner speech. If the production of such thoughts does not\nproceed further through the speech production process, such that they\nare morpho-phonologically encoded in addition to having semantic\ncontent and syntactic structure, they will occur as unconscious inner\nspeech episodes.\n\nFinally, it has been suggested that there is a close connection\nbetween inner speech and a phenomenon known as \u201cunsymbolized\nthought\u201d. Using the Descriptive Experience Sampling paradigm,\nRussell Hurlburt and Christopher Heavey (e.g., Hurlburt & Heavey\n2002; Heavey & Hurlburt 2008) have gathered introspective data\nthat they interpret as providing evidence that people sometimes have\nthe experience of\n\n\nthinking a particular, definite thought without the awareness of that\nthought\u2019s being conveyed in words, images, or any other symbols.\n(Heavey & Hurlburt 2008: 802)\n\n\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique & Vicente (2015), Vicente &\nMart\u00ednez-Manrique (2016), and Vicente & Jorba (2019)\nsuggest that these \u201cunsymbolized thoughts\u201d occur when the\nproduction of an inner speech episode is aborted at the earliest stage\nof production, when only the content or message to be expressed has\nbeen formulated. Appealing to accounts on which we experience\nconscious representations of actions which we begin to perform but\nabort, they suggest that an unsymbolized thought is a representation\nof the message which one commenced expressing in inner speech, which\nbecomes conscious because the process was aborted. Insofar as the\nprocess was aborted prior to the message being organized in phonetic\nform, the representation is entirely amodal. See also Kompa\n(forthcoming).\n",
