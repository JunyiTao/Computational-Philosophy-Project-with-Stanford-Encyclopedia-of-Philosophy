    "main_text": "Teleosemantic Theories || Causal-Informational Theories\n3.4 Causal-Informational Theories\n\nThe problems faced by use-oriented theories like Millikan\u2019s and\nPapineau\u2019s have led some theorists to reconsider the\ninformational approach originally pioneered by Stampe and Dretske\n (section 3.1).\n One new theory that stands in this tradition is Karen Neander\u2019s\n(2013, 2017) causal-informational theory of content.\n\nNeander\u2019s starting point is the notion of a response function\n(Neander 2013; 2017, ch. 6). She claims that sensory-perceptual\nsystems have such response functions, where to \u2018respond\u2019\nto something is to be caused by it to do something else. For example,\na visual system might be caused by a red instantiation to change into\na RED state, and it might have been selected (in part) for being\ndisposed to do so. This means, according to Neander, that the system\nhas the function to respond to red instances by changing into a RED\nstate.\n\nOn Neander\u2019s view, the resulting states (like, e.g., RED) are\nrepresentations of the causes to which the system is supposed to\nrespond by producing these states. They are, so to speak,\nrepresentations of their \u2018Normal causes\u2019. On this view,\nRED has the content red is present if the visual system that\nproduces RED has the function to produce it in response to the\npresence of red, or more specifically in response to red being\ninstanced in the receptive field of the perceptual processing pathways\nresponsible for RED\u2019s production. Since\n\u2018information\u2019 is defined in causal terms by Neander, she\ncan also state her view by saying that RED has the content red is\npresent because it is supposed to carry the information that red\nis present (Neander 2017, 146). This is Neander\u2019s basic idea,\nthough two further requirements are added. One is a second-order\nsimilarity requirement (Neander 2017, ch. 8) that we will set aside\nhere.\n\nThe other is a requirement that is designed to solve the problem of\ndistal content, i.e. to exclude states that are too proximal (the\nProx-Cs, for short) from the contents of sensory representations. With\nthe addition of this requirement, Neander\u2019s analysis looks as\nfollows:\n\nA sensory-perceptual representation, R, in a\nsensory-perceptual system S, has the descriptive content\nC is present and not Prox-C is present if:\n\n\nS was selected for producing Rs in response to\nCs and,\nif S was selected for producing Rs in response\nto both Cs and Prox-Cs, it was selected for\nproducing Rs in response to Prox-Cs because this was\na means to its producing Rs in response to Cs and\nnot vice-versa (cf. Neander 2013, 34; 2017, 222).\n\n\n\nNote first that clause (1) on its own does not determine suitably\ndistal content because there is a causal chain leading from C\nto R and, if the system had been selected for responding to\nCs by producing Rs, it must also have been selected\nfor responding to the proximal items (the Prox-Cs) in the\ncausal chain (such as the light reflected from Cs toward the\nretina of the eye, in the case of visual perception). There is,\nhowever, an asymmetry, to which clause (2) appeals. The system was\nselected for its disposition to respond to the proximal items because\nby that means it responded to the more distal items, but the system\nwas not selected for responding to the more distal item because by\nthat means it responded to the more proximal items. This is why\nC, rather than one of the Prox-Cs, qualifies as the\ncontent of R.\n\nClause (1), which articulates the basic idea of Neander\u2019s\napproach, ensures different content ascriptions to those generated by\nbiosemantics and other \u2018use-oriented\u2019 theories. For\nexample, consider again the notorious case of the frog. Plausibly, the\nrelevant visual pathways in the frog\u2019s brain were selected for\ntheir disposition to be caused by a certain configuration of visible\nfeatures (roughly, something\u2019s being small, dark and moving) to\nproduce the sensory-perceptual representation in question, as well as\nfor their disposition to initiate orienting and so on thereby. They\nwere plausibly selected for this preferential response to the\nconfiguration of visible features because things with these features\nwere often enough nutritious for the frog. The visual pathways in the\nfrog were not selected for a disposition to respond to the nutritional\nvalue of a stimulus, however. For the normal frog\u2019s visual\nsystem has no causal sensitivity to the nutritional value of the\nstimulus and cannot have been selected for a causal sensitivity it did\nnot have. So, on this proposal, the visual content of the\nrepresentation is there\u2019s something small, dark, moving\n(or something along these lines) rather than there\u2019s\nfrog food. (For analogous reasons, Pietroski\u2019s kimus are\ncharacterized as representing the presence of red, not the absence of\nsnorf; cf. the discussion in\n section 3.2.)\n\nAccording to Neander (2006) the configuration of visible features is\nthe right style of visual content to ascribe for the purpose of\nmainstream scientific explanations of an anuran\u2019s visual\ncapacities (see also Neander 2017, ch. 5). Nor does this proposal seem\nto generate overly specific contents of the kind mentioned earlier in\nrelation to Millikan\u2019s biosemantics. On Neander\u2019s theory,\nthe frog does not represent the stimulus as not carrying an infectious\ndisease, even if only those small, dark and moving things that were\nnot carrying an infectious disease contributed to frog fitness when\nthe frog was fed. Sensory-perceptual systems can only have been\nselected for causal dispositions which past systems of the type\npossessed. Since past systems had no disposition to respond\npreferentially to the absence of an infectious disease in visual\nstimuli that were small, dark and moving, the fact that contributions\nto fitness were made only on those occasions when an infectious\ndisease was absent is, again, a background evolutionary fact that is\nnot content-constitutive on this proposal.\n\nOne possible concern is whether sufficient room for misrepresentation\nhas been made. Some early discussions of teleological theories of\ncontent assumed that the content of the frog\u2019s representation\nmust be there\u2019s frog food or there\u2019s a\nfly or else misrepresentation would be impossible. On\nNeander\u2019s view, the frog would not be in error when it snapped\nat something small, dark and moving that was not frog food, or not a\nfly. However, misrepresentation is possible on this proposal. A\nrepresentation that is supposed to be produced in response to\nsomething that is small, dark and moving and is instead produced in\nresponse to something large and looming would count as misrepresenting\nand a neurologically damaged frog (e.g., one with a damaged thalamus)\nwill indeed attempt to catch all sorts of inappropriate things (e.g.,\nan experimenter\u2019s hand or even the frog\u2019s own limbs).\nNeander\u2019s theory also entails that a kimu\u2019s\nB-state will misrepresent if it is tokened in response to\nanything that is not red. More importantly, perhaps, it seems to\nentail that human REDs will misrepresent if tokened in response to\nsomething not-red, as could happen in color contrast illusions or in\nunusual viewing conditions.\n\nAs Millikan (2013a) and others have pointed out, there are\nrepresentations that cannot be caused by their contents, such as\nTOMORROW. No tomorrow has ever caused a thought about tomorrow.\nHowever, TOMORROW is not a sensory-perceptual representation and so\nthis is not an objection to Neander\u2019s proposal per se. As with\nother modest theories, however, the challenge is explaining how to\nlink this modest theory for some mental contents to a more\ncomprehensive theory that accounts for all of the contents of all of\nour concepts (see also\n section 4.4).\n\nNeander\u2019s theory has been the focus of much discussion in recent\nyears. A number of critics have taken issue with Neander\u2019s\nsolution to the distality problem. Price (2014) and Artiga (2015)\nquestion whether the \u2018distality principle\u2019 (i.e. the\nsecond clause of the analysis presented above) is really consistent\nwith Neander\u2019s basic idea. Schulte (2018, 2022) defends the\nconsistency of Neander\u2019s view, but argues that it yields\nproblematic content ascriptions in certain hypothetical cases and,\narguably, also in actual cases (e.g. cases of olfactory perception).\nHe then develops a modified version of the causal-informational theory\nthat is supposed to avoid these \n consequences.[15]\n\n\nAnother aspect of Neander\u2019s theory that has been criticized is\nher causal requirement: the claim that properties can only enter into\nthe content of a sensory-perceptual representation R if they are\ncausally relevant for bringing it about that R is tokened. Green\n(2017) argues that this requirement, as spelled out by Neander (2017,\n270\u2013271), has the counterintuitive consequence that visual\nrepresentations that appear to represent an object as moving through\nadjacent regions of space (\u2018something moves from region 1 to\nregion 2 to \u2026\u2019) actually represent the successive\noccurrence of object presences in those regions (\u2018something is\nin region 1, then something is in region 2, then \u2026\u2019).\nGanson (2021a) also takes issue with the causal requirement. He\ncontends that Neander cannot accommodate distance representations that\nare generated on the basis of visual cues that are statistically, but\nnot causally related to the distance of perceived objects.\n\nWhether Neander\u2019s theory or some other version of\ncausal-informational teleosemantics can overcome these problems will\nbe a matter for future discussion.\n",
