    "main_text": "Cloning for Research and Therapy || A Slippery Slope to Reproductive Cloning\n2.4 A Slippery Slope to Reproductive Cloning\n\nSlippery slope arguments express the worry that permitting a certain\npractice may place us on a slippery slope to a dangerous or otherwise\nunacceptable outcome. Several commentators have argued that accepting\nor allowing cloning research is the first step that would place us on\na slippery slope to reproductive cloning. As Leon Kass (1998, 702) has\nput it: \u201conce the genies put the cloned embryos into the\nbottles, who can strictly control where they go?\u201d\n\nOthers are more skeptical about slippery slope arguments against\ncloning and think that effective legislation can prevent us from\nsliding down the slope (Savulescu 1999; Devolder & Savulescu\n2006). If reproductive cloning is unacceptable, these critics say, it\nis reasonable to prohibit this specific technology rather than to ban\nnon-reproductive applications of cloning. The UK and Belgium, for\nexample, allow cloning research but prohibit the transfer of cloned\nembryos to the uterus.\n\nApart from the question of how slippery the slope might be, another\nquestion raised by such arguments concerns the feared development\n\u2013reproductive cloning\u2013 and whether it is really ethically\nobjectionable. Profound disagreement exists about the answer to this\nquestion.\n",
