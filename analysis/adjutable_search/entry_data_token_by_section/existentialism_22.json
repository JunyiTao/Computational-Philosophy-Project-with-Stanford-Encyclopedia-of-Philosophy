Prominent anglophone philosophers\nsuch as Harry Frankfurt (1971), Charles Taylor (1985), and Alasdair\nMacIntyre (1981) have drawn on classical existentialism to illuminate\nhow we exist in the meanings and self-interpretations that we create\nfor ourselves. My sense of who I am is constituted by an ongoing\nprocess of choosing, pulling together, and consolidating the roles,\nprojects, and meanings that matter to me and that are made available by\nthe sociohistorical situation I find myself in. On this view, the story\nI create for myself is held together by the narrative unity and\ncohesion that I give to it. This is what Taylor means when he says that\nwe can only understand or \u201cgrasp our lives in a narrative\u201d\n(1989, 47). And this conception of narrative identity not only offers a\nresponse to overly reductive conceptions of the self that are grounded\nin the substance ontologies of mind and body; it demonstrates an\nattentiveness to the ambiguous tension of our condition, that our\nchoices are both self-fashioning and socially embedded, that we\nsimultaneously make ourselves and are already made. \n",
