    "main_text": "Virtues and Vices\n4. Virtues and Vices\n\nHume and Kant both treat the concepts of virtue and vice as central to\nhuman morality. But they differ on the basic nature of virtue, and\nthey offer different catalogues of the virtues and vices. Kant\u2019s\ndiscussions reflect his consistent emphasis on freedom, dignity,\nrationality, and purity of motive. Hume\u2019s reflect his emphasis\non utility, pleasure, and the inherently social nature of the mind.\nCorrespondingly, the notion of internal struggle is central to\nKant\u2019s account, while Hume portrays virtue in comparatively\nrelaxed and genial terms. Relatedly, Hume is far more comfortable with\nthe bourgeois virtues integral to successful participation in modern\ncommercial and political society (cf. EPM 9.1.2). By contrast, Kant is\nwarier of society\u2019s influence on the individual, more insistent\non the need to resist the power of what Rousseau calls\namour-propre.\n\nFor Hume, the concepts of virtue and vice apply primarily to character\ntraits or \u201cmental qualities\u201d, and secondarily to occurrent\nmotives and actions. According to Hume, a character trait is a virtue\nif, and only if, it \u201cgives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment\nof approbation\u201d (EPM App. I.10). Vices, by contrast, are those\ntraits that generate a displeasing sentiment of disapproval.\nHume\u2019s definition builds on his account of moral judgment, and\nit makes virtue dependent on the responses of a\n\u201cjudicious\u201d spectator who contemplates things from a\ngeneral point of view. The trait of prudence, for example, is a virtue\nbecause it tends to be pleasing to such a spectator. As Hume\nputs it, the defining mark of a virtue is that it has the \u201cpower\nof producing love or pride\u201d when surveyed from the general point\nof view (T 3.3.1.3). In other words, a trait is a virtue only insofar\nas it tends to provoke the moral sentiment of approval in a properly\nsituated spectator. If it did not tend to provoke this response, it\nwould not be a virtue. Note how this marks a significant departure\nfrom Aristotelian conceptions of virtue, which says instead that a\ncharacter trait\u2019s goodness is a function of the role it plays in\nthe agent\u2019s own flourishing (Cohon 2008: 161).\n\nHume operates with a capacious catalogue of virtues and vices. His\naccount in the Treatise is organized around the distinction\nbetween \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cartificial\u201d virtues,\nwhich is easily misunderstood. The question is not whether some\nvirtues are fake or phony and others are authentic. The question is\nwhether some depend on social conventions and others do not.\nOrganizing his catalogue by means of this distinction allows Hume to\nsteer a middle path between those who see morality as entirely\nconventional (e.g., Bernard Mandeville) and those who believe it\nsprings directly from features of human nature that exist\nindependently of social convention (e.g., Francis Hutcheson).\nAccording to Hume, some virtues do depend on social convention but\nothers do not (Cohon 2008: 162\u2013163). In both cases, he seeks to\nexplain why people tend to develop such traits and why they tend to be\npleasing to judicious spectators. Hume drops the artificial-natural\ndistinction from the second Enquiry, but his investigations\nthere are motivated by the same questions and the resulting view also\nsteers a middle course between figures such as Mandeville and\nHutcheson.\n\nAccording to the Treatise, artificial virtues include\njustice, fidelity to promises, allegiance to government, and chastity.\nHume devotes much discussion to justice, which he treats as a\nparamount and paradigmatic artificial virtue. Hume understands justice\nprimarily as honesty with respect to property or conformity to\nconventions of property (T 3.2.2.28). Establishing a system of\nproperty allows us to avoid conflict and enjoy the possession and use\nof various goods. The social value of conventions involving property\nseems obvious. Yet one reason that justice receives such attention\nfrom Hume is that it poses a problem about moral motivation and moral\napproval. Hume claims that there must be a natural (non-moral) motive\nfor morally good actions. Otherwise they could only be done because\nthey are morally good, which would be circular, since our judgment of\nacts as morally good reflects our approval of the motives and traits\nthat give rise to the acts in question (T 3.2.1.7, 3.2.1.17). But this\nposition makes it hard to see how justice can be a virtue; for it is\nhard to find the requisite natural, nonmoral motive for it.\nSelf-interest is the natural motive that justifies our establishing\nrules regarding property (T 3.2.2.24); but self-interest is neither\nalways satisfied by just acts, nor approved in the way that traits we\ncall virtues generally are (T 3.2.1.9\u201310). Benevolence cannot be\nsuch a motive either, since it sometimes favors bending or suspending\nthe rules of justice, and benevolence lacks the power to motivate just\nconduct when it\u2019s difficult (e.g., T 3.2.1.12). Hume himself says that\n\u201ca sympathy with public interest is the source of\nthe moral approbation, which attends that virtue\u201d\n(T 3.2.2.24). But since sympathy with the public interest itself seems\nneither nonmoral nor inherent in human nature, this claim redescribes\nthe problem rather than solves it. Hume must ground sympathy for the\npublic interest in more obviously natural sentiments, and explain its\ndevelopment from them (e.g., as self-interest, corrected or redirected\nthrough education or the contrivances of politicians). Otherwise, Hume\nmust abandon his claim that all morally good actions\u2014even those\nassociated with artificial virtues\u2014have non-moral, natural\nmotives. (See Gauthier 1979; Mackie 1980: ch. 5; and Darwall 1995:\n302\u2013316.)\n\nThe natural virtues are good independently of social convention.\nHume\u2019s generous list of natural virtues includes beneficence,\nprudence, temperance, frugality, industry, assiduity, enterprise,\ndexterity, generosity, and humanity (T 3.3.1.24). In the second\nEnquiry, he distinguishes among virtues useful to others,\nvirtues useful to oneself, virtues immediately agreeable to oneself,\nand virtues immediately agreeable to others. Among qualities useful to\nothers are justice, fidelity, honor, allegiance, chastity, along with\nthe other \u201csocial virtues\u201d of humanity, generosity,\ncharity, affability, lenity, mercy, and moderation (EPM 5.2.44). Among\nqualities useful to ourselves are discretion, caution, enterprise,\nindustry, assiduity, frugality, economy, good sense, prudence,\ndiscernment (EPM 6.1.21). Among qualities contrary to our own\nwell-being are indolence, negligence, \u201cwant of order and\nmethod\u201d, obstinacy, fickleness, rashness, and credulity (EPM\n6.1.1). Qualities immediately agreeable to oneself include\ncheerfulness, tranquility, benevolence, and delicacy of taste.\nQualities immediately agreeable to others include good manners,\npoliteness, wit, ingenuity, decency, cleanliness, and a graceful or\ngenteel manner. What holds all these varied traits together as virtues\nis their evoking the sentiment of approval in spectators, itself\ngrounded in sympathy.\n\nLike Hume, Kant takes virtue to be central to human morality. But his\nbasic conception of virtue differs from Hume\u2019s, as does his\ncatalogue of particular virtues and vices. According to Kant, virtue\nis the form in which a being with an imperfect or non-holy will\nexpresses her supreme commitment to morality. Virtue is such a\nbeing\u2019s continually cultivated capacity to master her\ninclinations so as to fulfill her duties; a capacity whose cultivation\nand exercise is motivated by respect for the moral law (Denis 2006;\nBaxley 2010; Wilson 2015a). Several related claims are integral to\nKant\u2019s view. First, virtue is a general disposition to do\none\u2019s duty out of respect for the moral law (CPrR 5:128, 160; C\n27:300). Second, virtue is a kind of strength. More specifically,\nvirtue is \u201ca moral strength of the will\u201d (MM 6:405) or\n\u201cmoral strength in adherence to one\u2019s duty\u201d (Ant\n7:147). Third, virtue presupposes opposition and entails internal\nstruggle. Virtue\u2019s primary opponent is the \u201cradical evil\nin human nature\u201d\u2014a propensity to adopt maxims that\nprioritize self-love (and inclinations generally) over the moral law\n(Rel 6:29, 35\u201337, 57 n., 58). It is because of radical evil that\nvirtue implies struggle and demands strength. The fundamental task of\nthe virtuous person is to achieve the proper ordering of her\nincentives, giving the moral law undisputed priority over self-love.\nFinally, virtue is moral self-constraint \u201cbased on inner\nfreedom\u201d (MM 6:408), which is the capacity to act on the\nautonomously chosen principles of morality, even in the face of\ntemptation (MM 6:394, 405). Virtue both expresses and promotes inner\nfreedom. The greater one\u2019s moral strength and self-constraint,\nthe more one acts on reason rather than inclination or impulse (MM\n6:382 n).\n\nKant\u2019s catalogue of virtues and vices is organized by his system\nof duties. These duties are grounded in the moral law, the supreme\nprinciple of morality, which impresses itself on us as a categorical\nimperative. All duties must ultimately derive from this supreme moral\nprinciple. But in the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant\u2019s\ndiscussion of particular duties of virtue is based more directly on\nwhat he calls the \u201csupreme principle of the doctrine of\nvirtue\u201d. This principle enjoins us to \u201cact in accordance\nwith a maxim of ends that it can be a universal law for\neveryone to have\u201d (MM 6:395). As Kant explains,\n\n\nIn accordance with this principle a human being is an end for himself\nas well as for others, and it is not enough that he is not authorized\nto use either himself or others merely as a means (since he could then\nstill be indifferent to them); it is in itself his duty to make the\nhuman being as such his end. (MM 6:395)\n\n\nDuties of virtue pertain to the ends, principles, and attitudes of\nagents. They aim to protect each agent\u2019s inner freedom, and they\ncannot be compelled by the state or any other external force. It is\nbecause duties of virtue alone are subject only to internal compulsion\nthat Kant calls them \u201cdirectly ethical duties.\u201d Among\nthese duties are the perfect duties to oneself to avoid vices of\nsuicide, self-mutilation, gluttony, drunkenness, sexual\nself-degradation (duties to oneself as an animal and moral being),\nlying, avarice, and servility (duties to oneself as a moral being\nonly); the imperfect duties to oneself concerning the promotion of the\nobligatory end of one\u2019s own natural and moral perfection, along\nwith duties to foster self-knowledge, compassion for animals, and\nappreciation of the beautiful in nature; the perfect duties to others\nto avoid the vices of arrogance, defamation, and ridicule (duties of\nrespect), and the imperfect duties to promote the end of others\nhappiness by means of beneficence, sympathy, and gratitude, as well as\nby avoiding malice, envy, and ingratitude (duties of love and vices\nopposed to them). Kant does not claim to derive these duties from the\ncategorical imperative or the supreme principle of virtue alone.\nRather, in moving from general principles of morality to moral duties,\nhe draws on a variety of considerations regarding human nature and\nother aspects of the natural world.\n\nHume and Kant share several influences, so there are unsurprising\nareas of overlap. First, like most eighteenth-century philosophers,\nboth regard the pursuit of virtue as central to human morality.\nSecond, Kant sides with Hume and Hutcheson against the psychological\negoism associated with Pufendorf, Hobbes, Locke, and Mandeville\n(Wilson 2015b; on this debate within British moral philosophy, see\nCrisp 2019 and Maurer 2019). Third, they both accept of versions of\nGrotius\u2019s influential distinction between perfect and imperfect\nduties, though their uses of the distinction differ (see Schneewind\n1990). Fourth, their respective conceptions of virtue are secular by\nhistorical standards. Neither recognizes duties to God, for example,\nand neither counts piety, hope, or monkish self-abasement among the\nvirtues (e.g.,\u00a0EPM 9.1.3 and\u00a0C 27:379\u201380).\n\nImportant differences stand out against this backdrop of agreement.\nHume defines virtue in terms of the moral sentiments of a judicious\nspectator who views things from a common point of view. Kant, by\ncontrast, defines virtue in terms of duty, obligation, and law. He\nthinks of virtue as moral strength, which is measured by an\nagent\u2019s ability to defeat those inclinations that oppose the\ndemands of the moral law (MM 6:405\u2013407). Hume\u2019s theory of\nvirtue has a place for duty and law, but these are not the fundamental\nconcepts in terms of which everything else must be explained or\njustified. Moreover, while Hume certainly recognizes virtues such as\nstrength of mind, fortitude, and courage, they are not central to his\nview of virtue as such. Their status as virtues depends on the moral\nsentiments of a judicious spectator, as well as the exigencies and\nconventions of a particular age (EPM \u201cA Dialogue\u201d.40). For\nKant, such factors are irrelevant to the basic question of what\ndetermines virtue and vice.\n\nA few additional differences are worth noting. First, unlike Hume,\nKant insists on the unitary nature of virtue: \u201cin its Idea\n(objectively) there is only one virtue (as moral strength of\none\u2019s maxims)\u201d (MM 6:447; cf. MM 6:395 and 406). Second,\nHume maintains that the concepts of virtue and vice can apply to\nthings outside our control, such as traits and motives that spring\ninvoluntarily from our basic temperament. For example, wit, good\nmemory, and other \u201cmental abilities\u201d are virtues because of their\npower to garner the approval of a judicious spectator, even if they\nspring from temperament, upbringing, or other factors outside the\nagent\u2019s control (T 3.3.4.1\u20135). Kant, by contrast, restricts the\napplication of virtue concepts to traits, behaviors, and attitudes\nthat are voluntarily adopted and cultivated as a matter of principle.\nEach virtue and each vice has its own maxim (MM 6:404). For example,\nbeing \u201cnaturally\u201d witty is not virtuous; neither is cultivating wit\nfor the sake of social status or power. For Kant, wittiness is not an\nethical virtue unless it is voluntarily cultivated for morally\nadmirable reasons. Third, Kant and Hume view justice quite\ndifferently. Justice is central to Hume\u2019s picture of morality, but\nKant does not treat it as an ethical virtue at all. For Kant, justice\nis a matter of right or law (Recht), which regulates actions\nbut not their underlying motives and ends. Furthermore, Hume treats\njustice as an \u201cartificial\u201d virtue, but Kant would reject the\nartificial-natural distinction altogether. On his view, ethical\nvirtues are neither artificial nor natural in Hume\u2019s sense. Finally,\ntheir conceptions of moral vice are quite different. For Hume a vice\nis a mental quality that provokes disapproval from a judicious\nspectator. A person\u2019s vices do not necessarily say anything\nabout the quality of her will as a whole or her fundamental attitude\ntoward the demands of morality. But Kant holds that vice is a\npropensity to act contrary to the moral law (Rel 6:37), and it implies\na genuine \u201ccontempt for moral laws\u201d (C 27:463).\nAs he puts it, \u201cit is when an intentional transgression has\nbecome a principle that it is properly called a vice\u201d\n(MM 6:390).\n",
