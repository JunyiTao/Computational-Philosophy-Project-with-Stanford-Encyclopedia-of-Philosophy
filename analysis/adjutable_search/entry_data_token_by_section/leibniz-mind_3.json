    "main_text": "Perception and Appetition\n4. Perception and Appetition\n\nWhat do we find in the human mind? Representations on the one hand,\nand tendencies, inclinations, or strivings on the other, according to\nLeibniz. Or, to put this in Leibniz\u2019s more customary\nterminology, what is found within us is perception and appetition.\nHuman minds count for Leibniz as simple substances, and, as he says in\na letter to De Volder of 30 June 1704, \u201cit may be said that\nthere is nothing in the world except simple substances, and, in them,\nperception and appetite\u201d (G II, 270/A&G 181).\n\nPerception has already been discussed briefly above. But it will be\nadvisable to consider also a definition from a letter to Des Bosses\n(and echoed in many other passages) in which Leibniz discusses\nperception as the representation or \u201cexpression\u201d of\n\u201cthe many in the one\u201d (letter to Des Bosses, 11 July 1706;\nG II, 311). We shall return to this definition below. Appetitions are\nexplained as \u201ctendencies from one perception to another\u201d\n(Principles of Nature and Grace, sec.2 (1714); G VI,\n598/A&G 207). Thus, we represent the world in our perceptions, and\nthese representations are linked with an internal principle of\nactivity and change (Monadology, sec.15 (1714); G VI,\n609/A&G 215) which, in its expression in appetitions, urges us\never onward in the constantly changing flow of mental life. More\ntechnically explained, the principle of action, that is, the primitive\nforce which is our essence, expresses itself in momentary derivative\nforces involving two aspects: on the one hand, there is a\nrepresentative aspect (perception), by which the many without are\nexpressed within the one, the simple substance; on the other, there is\na dynamical aspect, a tendency or striving towards new perceptions,\nwhich inclines us to change our representative state, to move towards\nnew perceptions. (For more details, see Carlin 2004 and Jorati\n2017.)\n\nIt should not be inferred that this appetitive tendency to change is\nentirely governed by efficient causation only. For in Leibniz\u2019s\nview, value and final causes are not excluded from the action of the\nmind, the change of mental states. As he says in section 13 of the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics (1686), just as \u201cGod will\nalways do the best, \u2026 a man shall always do \u2026 that which\nappears to him to be the best\u201d (G IV, 438/A&G 46).\nAppearance, of course, has to do with perception; doing, with\nappetition. So this principle of human action applies directly, as one\nwould expect, to the two key factors of monadic interior life, only\nwith the role of value, or an end in view, now more clearly in focus.\nThis is why Leibniz says that, at the level of bodies (that is, for\nLeibniz, at the level of well-founded phenomena), all occurs according\nto the laws of efficient causes; whereas with respect to perceptions\nand appetites (or at least with some of these\u2014interpretations\ndiffer here) all occurs according to the laws of final causes. And\nalthough both types of causation can be found at both levels (cf.\nCarlin 2006), there is no clash here given the harmony of final and\nefficient causes in Leibniz\u2019s system.\n\nTo be sure, at an ultimate level, the only actions of substances\nare changes of perceptions. Thus, at the ultimate level, the\nappetitions are not so much the tendencies impelling a person towards\nvoluntary motions of the human body (although at the level of\nwell-founded phenomena this may indeed be the case) but rather\ntendencies arising out of present perceptions (present appearances)\ntowards new perceptions. This explains why Leibniz defines appetitions\nin the initially surprising way noted above, as \u201ctendencies from\none perception to another\u201d\u2014another\nperception, that is.\n\nThe last two paragraphs have helped to clarify appetition. It is time\nto return to perception. In Leibniz\u2019s definition (the expression\nof the many in the one) the two key terms are \u201cexpression\u201d\nand \u201cone.\u201d Both of them bear considerable weight in\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics. Representation or expression (Leibniz\nuses the two terms interchangeably) has its own definition: \u201cOne\nthing expresses another \u2026 when there is a constant and\nregulated relation between what can be said of the one and of the\nother\u201d (letter to Arnauld, 9 October 1687; G II, 112/LA 144).\nExamples, in addition to perception, include a map expressing or\nrepresenting a geographical region and an algebraic equation\nrepresenting or expressing a geometric figure, such as a circle or an\nellipse.\n\nAs we saw in the first section, with respect to oneness, Leibniz\nfamously claims that only something with true unity is truly real. For\nLeibniz, what truly is is substance, so it is not surprising\nthat at one point he clarifies his definition of perception by saying\nthat perception is \u201cthe expression of many things in one, or\nin simple substance\u201d (A New Method of Learning and\nTeaching Jurisprudence, revision notes of 1697\u20131700; A VI,\ni, 272/L 91).\n\nFinally, it should be recalled that for Leibniz there are quite\ndistinct levels of perception among created substances. Some of these\nwill be taken up in more detail in the following section, but the\nbasic point for now is that the three major levels, from the lowest to\nthe highest, are bare perception (without special distinctness or\nmemory), sensation (with heightened distinctness and memory), and\nthought (with distinctness, memory, and reflection). These are\ndistinctive of the three levels of monads, respectively, the bare\nmonads, souls, and spirits. Only the last of these may properly be\nsaid to have reason. Only the last of these is strictly a mind in the\nLeibnizian classification.\n",
