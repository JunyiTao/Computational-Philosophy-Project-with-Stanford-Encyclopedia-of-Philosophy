Interaction with Parthood\n\nPhilosophers have put forward of variety of axiom systems that are\nmeant to capture the interaction between parthood and location. One\nespecially bold idea is that the mereological properties of, and\nrelations between, located entities perfectly match those of\ntheir locations. This has been dubbed Mereological Harmony\n(Schaffer 2009).\n\nFor a collection of axioms that makes no attempt enforce Mereological\nHarmony, see the supplementary document on\n An Interpenetration-Friendly Theory of Location.\n\n\nMereological Harmony has been captured formally in different ways by\nVarzi (2007), Uzquiano (2011), and Leonard (2016). Saucedo (2011:\n227\u2013228) offers the following principles:\n\n(H1)\n x is mereologically simple iff x's location is\nmereologically simple.\n(H2)\n x is mereologically complex iff x's location is\nmereologically complex.\n(H3)\n x has exactly n parts iff x's location has\nexactly n parts.\n(H4)\n x is gunky iff x's location is gunky. \u2026\n(H5)\n x is a part of y iff x's location is a\nsubregion of y's location.\n(H6)\n x is a proper part of y iff x's location is\na proper part of y's location.\n(H7)\n x and y overlap iff x's location and\ny's location overlap.\n(H8)\n The xs compose y iff the locations of the xs\ncompose y's location.\n\n\nSome philosophers take Mereological Harmony to be a necessary truth\n(Schaffer 2009:\n 138).[2]\n The remainder of this entry considers three separate threats to the\nview that Mereological Harmony is necessary: interpenetration\n (\u00a74),\n extended simples\n (\u00a75),\n and multilocation\n (\u00a76).\n\nThere are other threats to Mereological Harmony that we will not\ndiscuss, e.g., threats to H7 and H8 that arise from \u2018moderate\nviews about receptacles\u2019, according to which only topologically\nopen (alternatively: only topologically closed) regions can be exact\nlocations (see Cartwright 1975; Hudson 2005: 47\u201356; and\nespecially Uzquiano 2006), or threats to H4 discussed in Uzquiano\n(2011).)\n\nA case of interpenetration occurs when non-overlapping entities have\noverlapping exact locations\u2014e.g., when a ghost passes through a\nwall. In such a case, the right-to-left direction of H7 fails. Similar\ncases involve violations of the right-to-left directions of H5 and H6.\nAn extended simple is a simple entity with a complex exact location:\nit violates the left-to-right direction of H1, the right-to-left\ndirection of the (equivalent) H2, and the left-to-right direction of\nthe instance of H3 that results from letting n = 1. A case of\nmultilocation occurs when a given entity has more than one exact\nlocation. This violates Functionality, which is left implicit in\nSaucedo's statement of Mereological Harmony.\n\nThe three questions that we will consider\u2014Is interpenetration\npossible? Are extended simples possible? Is multilocation\npossible?\u2014are logically independent of one another. Thus there\nis room for eight specific packages of views. See Figure 2.\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nPackage\nInterpenetration?\nExtended simples?\nMultilocation? \n\n1\nyes\nyes\nyes \n\n2\nyes\nyes\nno \n\n3\nyes\nno\nyes \n\n4\nyes\nno\nno \n\n5\nno\nyes\nyes \n\n6\nno\nyes\nno \n\n7\nno\nno\nyes \n\n8\nno\nno\nno \n\n\n\nIt is important to note that even if interpenetration, extended\nsimples, and multilocation are all possible, some substantive\nprinciples linking parthood and location may still survive. For\nexample, the possibility of interpenetration and extended simples\nposes no threat to:\n\nExpansivity\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z\u2200w[[P(x,\ny) & L(x, z) & L(y,\nw)] \u2192 P(z, w)]\n\nNecessarily, if x is a part of y, and if x is\nexactly located at z and y is exactly located at\nw, then z is a part of w: \u2018the part's\nlocation is a part of the whole's\n location\u2019.[3]\nDelegation\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[[C(x)\n& L(x, y) & P(z, y)]\n\u2192 \u2203w\u2203u[PP(w, x)\n& O(u, y) & L(w,\nu)]]\n\nNecessarily, if x is complex and is exactly located at\ny, then for any part z of y, some proper part\nw of x is exactly located at some region that overlaps\n z.[4]\n\n\nExpansivity rules out cases like the following (Figure 3), in which\nthe object a is a part of the object o, but a's\nexact location, ra, is not a part of\no's exact location, r.\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object a is part of the object o, but a's\nexact location ra is not a part of o's\nexact location, r.\n\nRuled out by Expansitivity\n\n\n\nThe idea behind Delegation is that if x is complex, then if you\nstick a pin into x's exact location, you will have stuck that\npin into the exact location of one of x's proper parts as well.\nIn slightly different terms, a complex entity can't be weakly located\nat a certain region unless one of its proper parts\u2014a\n\u2018delegate\u2019\u2014is weakly located at that region as well.\n(Regarding the formal statement of Delegation, one might wonder why it\nis not formulated with \u2018PP(u, y)\u2019 in\nplace of \u2018O(u, y)\u2019 in the consequent.\nThe reason for this is that Delegation is meant to be friendly to\nextended simples. Suppose that a complex, spherical object, C,\nis exactly located a spherical region, r. Suppose that C\nis composed of two hemispherical simples, h and h*, and\nthat r is composed of continuum-many simple points, each\nplurality of which composes a region that is a part of r. Then,\ncontrary to the proposed revision, it will not be true that for every\npart y of r, some proper part of C is exactly\nlocated at a region that has y as a proper part. Consider, for\nexample, the spherical region r* with the same center point as,\nbut half the volume as, r itself. C does not have a\nproper part that is exactly located at r*, nor does it have a\nproper part whose exact location has r* as a proper part. But,\nas Delegation requires, C does have a proper part (h,\nfor example) that has an exact location that overlaps r*.)\n\nDelegation rules out cases like the following (Figure 4), in which\no* is a complex object that is exactly located at region\nr*, but r* has a part ra that\ndoes not overlap an exact location of any of o*'s proper\nparts:\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThe region ra is a part of object o*'s\nexact location, and object o* is complex, but no proper part of\no has an exact location that overlaps\nra.\n\nRuled out by Delegation\n\n\n\nNeither interpenetration nor extended simples seem to threaten\nExpansivity or Delegation.\n\nA potential threat to Delegation comes from Pickup (2016: 260), who\nconsiders the possibility of a complex entity that is exactly located\nsomewhere despite the fact that none of its proper parts is exactly\n(or weakly) located anywhere. One route to such entities (not\nPickup's) runs as follows: (i) some material objects (electrons,\nmaybe) do not have any other material objects as proper parts, (ii)\nany such material object is a complex entity whose only proper parts\nare universals, (iii) all material objects have locations, but (iv) no\nuniversals have locations. Bundle theorists who are platonic realists\nabout universals, and who take the constituents of a given bundle to\nbe parts of that bundle, will face pressure to accept (i)\u2013(iv)\nand hence to reject Delegation. The same basic idea is discussed in\nconnection with the Burying Strategy in Section 4.1 below.\n",
