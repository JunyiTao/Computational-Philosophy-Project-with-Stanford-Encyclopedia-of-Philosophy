The first\nmay be called the specification objection. The second is the\ntranscendence objection. \n3.1 The Specification Objection\n\n\nAccording to the specification objection, coherence theorists have\nno way to identify the specified set of propositions without\ncontradicting their position. This objection originates in Russell\n(1907). Opponents of the coherence theory can argue as follows. The\nproposition (1) \u201cJane Austen was hanged for murder\u201d coheres\nwith some set of propositions. (2) \u201cJane Austen died in her\nbed\u201d coheres with another set of propositions. No one supposes\nthat the first of these propositions is true, in spite of the fact that\nit coheres with a set of propositions. The specification objection\ncharges that coherence theorists have no grounds for saying that (1) is\nfalse and (2) true.\n\n\nSome responses to the specification problem are unsuccessful. One\ncould say that we have grounds for saying that (1) is false and (2) is\ntrue because the latter coheres with propositions which correspond to\nthe facts. Coherentists cannot, however, adopt this response without\ncontradicting their position. Sometimes coherence theorists maintain\nthat the specified system is the most comprehensive system, but this\nis not the basis of a successful response to the specification\nproblem.  Coherentists can only, unless they are to compromise their\nposition, define comprehensiveness in terms of the size of a\nsystem. Coherentists cannot, for example, talk about the most\ncomprehensive system composed of propositions which correspond to\nreality. There is no reason, however, why two or more systems cannot\nbe equally large. Other criteria of the specified system, to which\ncoherentists frequently appeal, are similarly unable to solve the\nspecification problem. These criteria include simplicity, empirical\nadequacy and others. Again, there seems to be no reason why two or\nmore systems cannot equally meet these criteria.\n\n\nAlthough some responses to the Russell\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection are unsuccessful, it is unable to refute the\ncoherence theory. Coherentists do not believe that the truth of a\nproposition consists in coherence with any arbitrarily chosen set of\npropositions. Rather, they hold that truth consists in coherence with a\nset of beliefs, or with a set of propositions held to be true. No one\nactually believes the set of propositions with which (1) coheres.\nCoherence theorists conclude that they can hold that (1) is false\nwithout contradicting themselves.\n\n\nA more sophisticated version of the specification objection has been\nadvanced by Walker (1989); for a discussion, see Wright (1995). Walker\nargues as follows. In responding to Russell\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection, coherentists claim that some set of\npropositions, call it S, is believed. They are committed to\nthe truth of (3) \u201cS is believed.\u201d The question of\nwhat it is for (3) to be true then arises. Coherence theorists might\nanswer this question by saying that \u201c\u2018S is\nbelieved\u2019 is believed\u201d is true. If they give this answer,\nthey are apparently off on an infinite regress, and they will never\nsay what it is for a proposition to be true. Their plight is worsened\nby the fact that arbitrarily chosen sets of propositions can include\npropositions about what is believed. So, for example, there will be a\nset which contains \u201cJane Austen was hanged for murder,\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Jane Austen was hanged for murder\u2019 is\nbelieved,\u201d and so on. The only way to stop the regress seems to\nbe to say that the truth conditions of (3) consist in the objective\nfact S is believed. If, however, coherence theorists adopt\nthis position, they seem to contradict their own position by accepting\nthat the truth conditions of some proposition consist in facts, not in\npropositions in a set of beliefs.\n\n\nThere is some doubt about whether Walker\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection succeeds. Coherence theorists can reply to\nWalker by saying that nothing in their position is inconsistent with\nthe view that there is a set of propositions which is\nbelieved. Even though this objective fact obtains, the truth conditions\nof propositions, including propositions about which sets of\npropositions are believed, are the conditions under which they cohere\nwith a set of propositions. For a defence of the coherence theory against\nWalker\u2019s version of the specification objection, see Young (2001).\n\n\nA coherence theory of truth gives rise to a regress, but it is not a\nvicious regress and the correspondence theory faces a similar regress.\nIf we say that p is true if and only if it coheres with a\nspecified set of propositions, we may be asked about the truth\nconditions of \u201cp coheres with a specified set.\u201d\nPlainly, this is the start of a regress, but not one to worry\nabout. It is just what one would expect, given that the coherence\ntheory states that it gives an account of the truth conditions of all\npropositions.  The correspondence theory faces a similar benign\nregress. The correspondence theory states that a proposition is true\nif and only if it corresponds to certain objective conditions. The\nproposition \u201cp corresponds to certain objective\nconditions\u201d is also true if and only if it corresponds to\ncertain objective conditions, and so on.\n3.2 The Transcendence Objection\n\n\nThe transcendence objection charges that a coherence theory of truth\nis unable to account for the fact that some propositions are true which\ncohere with no set of beliefs. According to this objection, truth\ntranscends any set of beliefs. Someone might argue, for example, that\nthe proposition \u201cJane Austen wrote ten sentences on November\n17th, 1807\u201d is either true or false. If it is false, some other\nproposition about how many sentences Austen wrote that day is true. No\nproposition, however, about precisely how many sentences Austen wrote\ncoheres with any set of beliefs and we may safely assume that none will\never cohere with a set of beliefs. Opponents of the coherence theory\nwill conclude that there is at least one true proposition which does\nnot cohere with any set of beliefs.\n\n\nSome versions of the coherence theory are immune to the\ntranscendence objection. A version which holds that truth is coherence\nwith the beliefs of an omniscient being is proof against the objection.\nEvery truth coheres with the set of beliefs of an omniscient being. All\nother versions of the theory, however, have to cope with the objection,\nincluding the view that truth is coherence with a set of propositions\nbelieved at the limit of inquiry. Even at the limit of inquiry, finite\ncreatures will not be able to decide every question, and truth may\ntranscend what coheres with their beliefs.\n\n\nCoherence theorists can defend their position against the\ntranscendence objection by maintaining that the objection begs the\nquestion. Those who present the objection assume, generally without\nargument, that it is possible that some proposition be true even though\nit does not cohere with any set of beliefs. This is precisely what\ncoherence theorists deny. Coherence theorists have arguments for\nbelieving that truth cannot transcend what coheres with some set of\nbeliefs. Their opponents need to take issue with these arguments rather\nthan simply assert that truth can transcend what coheres with a\nspecified system.\n3.3 The Logic Objection\n\n\nRussell (1912) presented a third classic objection to the coherence\ntheory of truth. According to this objection, any talk about coherence\npresupposes the truth of the laws of logic. For example, Russell\nargues, to say that two propositions cohere with each other is to\npresuppose the truth of the law of non-contradiction. In this case,\ncoherentism has no account of the truth of law of\nnon-contradiction. If, however, the coherence theorist holds that the\ntruth of the law of non-contradiction depends on its coherence with a\nsystem of beliefs, and it were supposed to be false, then propositions\ncannot cohere or fail to cohere. In this case, the coherence theory of\ntruth completely breaks down since propositions cannot cohere with\neach other.\n\nCoherentists have a plausible response to this objection. They may\nhold that the law of non-contradiction, like any other truth, is true\nbecause it coheres with a system of beliefs. In particular, the law of\nnon-contradiction is supported by the belief that, for example,\ncommunication and reasoning would be impossible unless every system of\nbeliefs contains something like law of non-contradiction (and the\nbelief that communication and reasoning are possible). It is true\nthat, as Russell says, if the law is supposed not to cohere with a\nsystem of beliefs, then propositions can neither cohere nor fail to\ncohere. However, coherence theorists may hold, they do not suppose the\nlaw of non-contradiction to be false. On the contrary, they are likely\nto hold that any coherent set of beliefs must include the law of\nnon-contradiction or a similar law.\n",
