Administration, Government, Constitutional Law\n\nAs with the panopticon, economy, transparency and accountability were\nequally important in Bentham\u2019s innovative account of\nadministration, as were devices to ensure the maximization of\n\u201cintellectual\u201d, \u201cmoral\u201d, and\n\u201cactive\u201d aptitude in public officials. In government\nutilitarian outcomes required various democratic procedures that\nfunction as \u201csecurities against misrule\u201d. These procedures\ninclude: \u201cvirtual\u201d universal suffrage, annual parliaments,\nthe secret ballot, and provisions for transparency, publicity and\nunconstrained public debate.\n\nMuch of what Bentham recommended in relation to administrative and\npolitical institutions is governed by \u201cthe\ninterest-junction-prescribing principle\u201d, designed to\nensure that the interests of those with power would be reconciled with\nthe public interest, the interests of the governed. This idea was\nprominent in A Fragment on Government, where he argued that\neffective government was not to be had on the foundation of abstract\nformulas such as \u201cmixed and balanced\u201d institutions, but\nrequired \u201cthe frequent and easy changes of condition\nbetween governors and governed; whereby the\ninterests of one class are more or less indistinguishably blended with\nthose of the other\u201d (1977, 485). In the later constitutional\nwritings Bentham added many more administrative devices to ensure\naptitude, transparency and accountability, none more important than\nthe \u201cPublic Opinion Tribunal\u201d, or the open court of public\nopinion founded on the freedom of the press, by which government\nactions could be held up to public scrutiny (1983b, 36). And, just as\nthe panopticon was to be monitored by the publication of regular\nreports, so reports of government activity were required to keep the\ndemocratic polity informed and facilitate the accountability of public\nofficials.\n\nWhen Bentham turned his thoughts to constitutional law in earnest in\nthe 1820s, partly inspired by constitution-making in parts of southern\nEurope, it was with the conviction that all states in which the\ninstitutions of representative democracy already existed or in which\nthey could be introduced were fertile soil for the utilitarian\npannomion. \u201cOf this constitution\u201d, he announced\nnear the beginning of the Constitutional Code, \u201cthe\nall-comprehensive object, or end in view, is, from first to last, the\ngreatest happiness of the greatest number; namely, of the individuals,\nof whom, the political community, or state, of which it is the\nconstitution, is composed\u201d (1983b, 18). The administrative,\nelectoral and legislative details of this project occupied much of the\nlast decade of his life, with its core ideas discussed in the pages of\na variety of works in addition to the Code, such as\nSecurities Against Misrule, First Principles Preparatory\nto Constitutional Code, and Official Aptitude Maximized;\nExpense Minimized. The subsidiary principles of accountability,\nefficiency, and economy underpinned the institutional design and\nprocedural operations elaborated in these writings. In essence, these\nprinciples provided the grounding for the \u201csecurities against\nmisrule\u201d that Bentham thought essential to ensure that the\ngreatest happiness would be the sole objective of government in a\nrepublican representative democracy.\n",
