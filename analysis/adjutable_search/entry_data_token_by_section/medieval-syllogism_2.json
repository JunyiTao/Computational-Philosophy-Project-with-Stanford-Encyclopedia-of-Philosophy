    "main_text": "Arabic Logic and Syllogisms\n3. Arabic Logic and Syllogisms\n\nArabic logic begins in the middle of the eighth century. As with logic\nin the Latin tradition, it has its foundation in Ancient Greek logic,\nprimarily in Aristotelian logic and syllogistics. The Syriac\nChristians adopted a teaching tradition in logic that included\nPorphyry\u2019s Isagoge in addition to Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, De interpretatione and the first seven\nchapters of the Prior Analytics. This teaching tradition was\nadopted and spread through the Arab conquest. During the Abbasid\nCaliphate (750\u20131258), there was a continuous and growing interest in\nphilosophy and logic. It is this time period that is often referred to\nas the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of Arabic philosophy and logic. \n\nGradually, the whole Organon was made available in Arabic\ntranslation (the Arabic tradition was unique in treating\nAristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric and Poetics as part of logic, unlike later\ntraditions in medieval logic. The first more important Arabic logician\nwas Ish\u00e2q al-Kind\u00ee (d. 870), who wrote a short overview of the whole\nof the Organon. After him, more and more substantial works\nwere produced. Ab\u00fb Nasr Alfarabi (d. 950) made the first original\ncontributions, writing a series of commentaries on Aristotle, although\nonly his commentary on De interpretatione has survived.\nAvicenna seems to have held his work in very high esteem. By far the\nmost important logician in the Arabic tradition, however, was Ibn\nS\u00een\u00e2 (d. 1037) or Avicenna, as he was known in the Latin West. \n\nAvicenna had a different attitude to Aristotle\u2019s logic than\nlogicians before him. He did not think that Aristotle was necessarily\nright. Aristotle had a lot of intuitions about logic that do not all\nfit together into a coherent whole. They had to be worked out and\nAvicenna believed that when that happened, it would become clear that\nAristotle\u2019s logic was only a fragment of a much larger system. After\nAvicenna, the general character of Arabic logic was no longer\nAristotelian but Avicennan, which is to say that the texts drawn upon\nby most logicians were no longer Aristotle\u2019s but Avicenna\u2019s (with\nthe notable exception of Averroes, known to the Latin tradition as\n\u2018the Commentator\u2019, i.e., on Aristotle). One work of Avicenna in\nparticular became important for subsequent logicians: what is known as\nAl-Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t wa\u2019l Tanb\u00eehat in Arabic and Pointers and\nReminders in English \u2014 or Remarks and Admonitions in S.\nInati\u2019s translation (Avicenna 1984). \n\nTony Street (2002, 2004) has identified three things that make logic\nAvicennan as opposed to Aristotelian: (1) truth-conditions of absolute\n(or assertoric, i.e., non-modal) sentences are expressed in modal\nterms; (2) logical properties of so-called descriptional\n(wasfi) sentences, such as \u2018Every B is A while B\u2019, are\nstudied; and (3) syllogisms are divided into connective and\nrepetitive. If a logician adopts (1)\u2013(3), he is following Avicenna,\naccording to Street. \n\nIn Pointer Two of Path Four, Avicenna introduces distinctions between\ndifferent kinds of sentences. The first distinction is between\nabsolute and modal sentences, although absolute sentences turn out to\nbe modal as well. The basic division is one between absolute sentences\nthat are taken to be definite or indefinite with respect to time. \n\nAvicenna talks about three kinds of absolute sentences, all of which\nare explicated with reference to time. First are absolute sentences\nthat refer to a definite time, but these play no role in his\ndiscussion. The other two are the general and the special absolute\nsentences. General absolute sentences are sentences taken without\nlimitation with respect to time, which means that they have to take in\nall individuals - past, present and future. Furthermore, the copula is\ntaken to mean that the Bs are As at least sometime, as in \u2018Every\nhuman is sometimes moving\u2019. A special absolute sentence is a\nsentence with limitations with respect to time, its subject term\nreferring to individuals at a specific moment in time - although it is\nnot explicated what moment in time that is. The copula is also\nunderstood as a conjunction meaning \u2018sometimes B and sometimes not\nB\u2019, as in \u2018Everything running is sometimes walking and sometimes\nnot walking\u2019. \n\nAvicenna is quick to point out that neither general nor special\nabsolute sentences behave as expected. For example, they do not fit\nthe traditional square of opposition. \u2018Every B is A\u2019 on the\ngeneral reading does not contradict \u2018Some B is not A\u2019. Thus, he\nintroduces one other kind of absolute sentence, namely a perpetual\nabsolute sentence. In a perpetual sentence the copula is simply read\nas \u2018is always\u2019. The contradictory of a general absolute is the\nperpetual absolute, and similarly with the special absolute, although\nit will contradict a disjunction of two perpetual sentences (see\nStreet 2002 and Lagerlund 2009). \n\nThe second distinctive Avicennan thesis is the introduction of\ndescriptional (wasfi) sentences. This is again done in the\ncontext of modal syllogistics, although, such sentences do not need to\nbe modal at all and Avicenna can be seen to have introduced a logic\nfor descriptional sentences (Street 2002). The example he gives in\nPointers and Reminders is: \n\n(3:1)\nEverything walking is necessarily moving while walking\n\n\nThe addition of \u2018while walking\u2019 restricts all moving things to\nthose actually walking, which makes the sentence true. Avicenna\ndistinguishes descriptional sentences from substantial sentences. The\nexample he gives of a substantial sentence is: \n\n(3:2)\nEvery human is necessarily an animal\n\n\nThe logic for substantial sentences is different from the logic for\ndescriptional sentences. A sentences like (3:2) converts according to\nthe standard Aristotelian conversion rules, so: \n\n(3:3)\n Every human being is necessarily an animal\n\n\nconverts into: \n\n(3:4)\n Some animal is necessarily a human.\n\n\nSuch sentences are characterized by as kath\u2019 hauto (per\nse) by Aristotle in Posterior Analytics I.4 (see Lagerlund 2000,\n30\u20131). Part of what Aristotle said about modal syllogistic is valid\nfor such sentences. \n\nBut another group of sentences, such as: \n\n(3:6)\n Every literate being is necessarily a human being\n\n\nare not substantial and hence do not convert, since this converted\nsentence is false: \n\n(3:7)\n Some human being is necessarily literate.\n\n\nHowever, if these are read as descriptional sentences, then they do\nconvert: \n\n(3:8)\n Every literate being is necessarily a human being while literate\n\n\nconverts into\n\n(3:9)\n Some human being is necessarily literate while literate.\n\n\nDescriptional sentences have a syllogistic logic like substantial\nsentences and Avicenna thinks part of Aristotle\u2019s modal syllogistic\ncan be worked out using descriptional sentences (for a comparison with\nsimilar logics found in the thirteenth-century Latin tradition, see\nLagerlund 2009). But even though Avicenna sketches a syllogistic for\ndescriptional sentences in Pointers and Reminders, he is\nmostly concerned with substantial sentences and their logic. \n\nThe third distinctive mark of Avicenna\u2019s logic is the distinction\nbetween so-called connective and repetitive syllogisms, which\ncorresponds roughly to Aristotle\u2019s distinction between categorical\nand hypothetical syllogisms.\n\nIn his history of Arabic logic, Khaled El-Rouayheb divides Arabic\nlogic after 1200 into several distinctive periods (El-Rouyaheb 2010).\nAccording to him the next period begins with Fakhr al-Din al-Razi.\nAfter Razi, the later Arabic logical tradition became disassociated\nfrom Aristotle and more narrowly focused on the predicables,\ndefinitions, propositions, and syllogisms. \n\nMost thirteenth-century logic can also be described as post-Avicennan\nin the sense that logicians in this period all took their departure\nfrom Avicenna rather than from Aristotle. In the fourteenth century\nanother transformation took place and the lengthy summaries found in\nthe earlier traditions became very rare. Instead of writing\ncommentaries on the works of Aristotle, Arabic logicians were content\nwith writing glosses. Their interest also shifted from formal logic\n(syllogisms) to semantic concerns. \n\nArabic logic began to fragment in the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies and several centers developed. El-Rouyaheb identifies\ndistinct Ottoman Turkish, Iranian, Indo-Muslim, North African, and\nChristian Arabic traditions. These developed independently of one\nother, and, according to El-Rouyaheb, it is the Ottoman Turkish\ntradition that is the most important up to the twentieth century. The\nbasic themes outlined by Avicenna remained dominant in this tradition,\nhowever. \n",
