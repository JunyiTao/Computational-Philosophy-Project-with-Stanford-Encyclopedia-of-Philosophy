    "main_text": "Conventions of language\n7. Conventions of language\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Cratylus offers a notable early discussion of\nlinguistic convention. Hermogenes defends a broadly conventionalist\nview of linguistic meaning:\n\n\n[N]o one is able to persuade me that the correctness of names is\ndetermined by anything besides convention\u2026 No name belongs to a\nparticular thing by nature, but only because of the rules and usages\nof those who establish the usage and call it by that name,\n(384c-d)\n\n\nwhile Cratylus advocates a rather obscure anti-conventionalist\nalternative:\n\n\nA thing\u2019s name isn\u2019t whatever people agree to call it\n\u2014some bit of their native language that applies to it\u2014but there\nis a natural correctness of names, which is the same for everyone,\nGreek or foreigner. (383a-b)\n\n\nNowadays, virtually all philosophers side with Hermogenes. Barring a\nfew possible exceptions such as onomatopoeia, the association between a\nword and its referent is not grounded in the intrinsic nature of either\nthe word or the referent. Rather, the association is\narbitrary. In this weak sense, everyone agrees that language\nis conventional. However, disagreement persists about whether social\nconvention plays a useful role in illuminating the workings of\nlanguage.\n",
