    "main_text": "Reciprocal Altruism\n5. But is it \u2018Real\u2019 Altruism?\n\n\nThe evolutionary theories described above, in particular kin\nselection, go a long way towards reconciling the existence of altruism\nin nature with Darwinian principles.  However, some people have felt\nthese theories in a way devalue altruism, and that the behaviours they\nexplain are not \u2018really\u2019 altruistic. The grounds for this\nview are easy to see. Ordinarily we think of altruistic actions as\ndisinterested, done with the interests of the recipient, rather than\nour own interests, in mind. But kin selection theory explains\naltruistic behaviour as a clever strategy devised by selfish genes as\na way of increasing their representation in the gene-pool, at the\nexpense of other genes. Surely this means that the behaviours in\nquestion are only \u2018apparently\u2019 altruistic, for they are\nultimately the result of genic self-interest? Reciprocal altruism\ntheory also seems to \u2018take the altruism out of\naltruism\u2019. Behaving nicely to someone in order to procure return\nbenefits from them in the future seems in a way the antithesis of\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism\u2014it is just delayed self-interest.\n\n\nThis is a tempting line of argument. Indeed Trivers (1971) and,\narguably, Dawkins (1976) were themselves tempted by it. But it should\nnot convince. The key point to remember is that biological altruism\ncannot be equated with altruism in the everyday vernacular sense.\nBiological altruism is defined in terms of fitness consequences, not\nmotivating intentions. If by \u2018real\u2019 altruism we mean\naltruism done with the conscious intention to help, then the vast\nmajority of living creatures are not capable of \u2018real\u2019\naltruism nor therefore of \u2018real\u2019 selfishness either. Ants\nand termites, for example, presumably do not have conscious intentions,\nhence their behaviour cannot be done with the intention of promoting\ntheir own self-interest, nor the interests of others. Thus the\nassertion that the evolutionary theories reviewed above show that the\naltruism in nature is only apparent makes little sense. The contrast\nbetween \u2018real\u2019 altruism and merely apparent altruism simply\ndoes not apply to most animal species.\n\n\nTo some extent, the idea that kin-directed altruism is not\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism has been fostered by the use of the\n\u2018selfish gene\u2019 terminology of Dawkins (1976). As we have\nseen, the gene's-eye perspective is heuristically useful for\nunderstanding the evolution of altruistic behaviours, especially those\nthat evolve by kin selection. But talking about \u2018selfish\u2019\ngenes trying to increase their representation in the gene-pool is of\ncourse just a metaphor (as Dawkins fully admits); there is no literal\nsense in which genes \u2018try\u2019 to do anything. Any\nevolutionary explanation of how a phenotypic trait evolves must\nultimately show that the trait leads to an increase in frequency of\nthe genes that code for it (presuming the trait is transmitted\ngenetically.) Therefore, a \u2018selfish gene\u2019 story can by\ndefinition be told about any trait, including a behavioural trait,\nthat evolves by Darwinian natural selection. To say that kin selection\ninterprets altruistic behaviour as a strategy designed by\n\u2018selfish\u2019 genes to aid their propagation is not wrong; but\nit is just another way of saying that a Darwinian explanation for the\nevolution of altruism has been found. As Sober and Wilson (1998) note,\nif one insists on saying that behaviours which evolve by kin selection\n/ donor-recipient correlation are \u2018really selfish\u2019, one\nends up reserving the word \u2018altruistic\u2019 for behaviours\nwhich cannot evolve by natural selection at all.\n\n\nDo theories of the evolution of biological altruism apply to humans?\nThis is part of the broader question of whether ideas about the\nevolution of animal behaviour can be extrapolated to humans, a\nquestion that fuelled the sociobiology controversy of the 1980s and is\nstill actively debated today (cf. Boyd and Richerson 2006, Bowles and\nGintis 2011, Sterelny 2012). All biologists accept that Homo sapiens is an\nevolved species, and thus that general evolutionary principles apply\nto it. However, human behaviour is obviously influenced by culture to\na far greater extent than that of other animals, and is often the\nproduct of conscious beliefs and desires (though this does not\nnecessarily mean that genetics has no influence.) Nonetheless, at\nleast some human behaviour does seem to fit the predictions of the\nevolutionary theories reviewed above. In general, humans behave more\naltruistically (in the biological sense) towards their close kin than\ntowards non-relatives, e.g. by helping relatives raise their children,\njust as kin selection theory would predict. It is also true that we\ntend to help those who have helped us out in the past, just as\nreciprocal altruism theory would predict. On the other hand, humans\nare unique in that we co-operate extensively with our non-kin; and\nmore generally, numerous human behaviours seem anomalous from the\npoint of view of biological fitness. Think for example of adoption.\nParents who adopt children instead of having their own reduce their\nbiological fitness, obviously, so adoption is an altruistic behaviour.\nBut it does not benefit kin\u2014for parents are generally\nunrelated to the infants they adopt\u2014and nor do the parents\nstand to gain much in the form of reciprocal benefits. So although\nevolutionary considerations can help us understand some human\nbehaviours, they must be applied judiciously.\n\n\nWhere human behaviour is concerned, the distinction between biological\naltruism, defined in terms of fitness consequences, and\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism, defined in terms of the agent's conscious\nintentions to help others, does make sense. (Sometimes the label\n\u2018psychological altruism\u2019 is used instead of\n\u2018real\u2019 altruism.) What is the relationship between these\ntwo concepts? They appear to be independent in both directions, as\nElliott Sober (1994) has argued; see also Vromen (2012) and Clavien and Chapuisat (2013).  An action\nperformed with the conscious intention of helping another human being\nmay not affect their biological fitness at all, so would not count as\naltruistic in the biological sense. Conversely, an action undertaken\nfor purely self-interested reasons, i.e., without the conscious\nintention of helping another, may boost their biological fitness\ntremendously.\n\n\nSober argues that, even if we accept an evolutionary approach to human\nbehaviour, there is no particular reason to think that evolution would\nhave made humans into egoists rather than psychological altruists (see\nalso Schulz 2011). On the contrary, it is quite possible that natural\nselection would have favoured humans who genuinely do care about\nhelping others, i.e., who are capable of \u2018real\u2019 or\npsychological altruism.  Suppose there is an evolutionary advantage\nassociated with taking good care of one's children\u2014a quite\nplausible idea. Then, parents who\nreally do care about their childrens' welfare, i.e., who are\n\u2018real\u2019 altruists, will have a higher inclusive fitness,\nhence spread more of their genes, than parents who only pretend to\ncare, or who do not care. Therefore, evolution may well lead\n\u2018real\u2019 or psychological altruism to evolve. Contrary to\nwhat is often thought, an evolutionary approach to human behaviour does\nnot imply that humans are likely to be motivated by\nself-interest alone. One strategy by which \u2018selfish genes\u2019\nmay increase their future representation is by causing humans to be\nnon-selfish, in the psychological sense.\n",
