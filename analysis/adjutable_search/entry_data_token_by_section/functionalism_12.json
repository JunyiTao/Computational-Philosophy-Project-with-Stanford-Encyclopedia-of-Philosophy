    "main_text": "Constructing Plausible Functional Theories || Characterizing Experiential States\n4.1 Characterizing Experiential States\n\nThe common strategy in the most successful treatments of perceptual\nexperiences and bodily sensations (Shoemaker 1984a, Clark 1993;\nadumbrated in Sellars 1956) is to individuate experiences of various\ngeneral types (color experiences, experiences of sounds, feelings of\ntemperature) in part by appeal to their positions in the\n\u201cquality spaces\u201d associated with the relevant sense\nmodalities \u2013 that is, the (perhaps multidimensional) matrices\ndetermined by judgments about the relative similarities and\ndifferences among the experiences in question. So, for example, the\nexperience of a very reddish-orange could be (partially) characterized\nas the state produced by the viewing of a color swatch within some\nparticular range, which tends to produce the judgment or belief that\nthe state just experienced is more similar to the experience of red\nthan of orange. (Analogous characterizations, of course, will have to\nbe given of these other color experiences.) The judgments or beliefs\nin question will themselves be (partially) characterized in terms of\ntheir tendencies to produce sorting or categorization behavior of\ncertain specified kinds.\n\nThis strategy may seem fatal to analytic functionalism, which\nrestricts itself to the use of a priori (or platitudinous) information\nto distinguish among mental states, since it\u2019s not clear that\nthe information needed to distinguish among experiences such as color\nperceptions is available to commonsense. However, this problem may not\nbe as dire as it seems. For example, if sensations and perceptual\nexperiences are characterized in terms of their places in a\n\u201cquality space\u201d determined by a person\u2019s\npre-theoretical judgments of similarity and dissimilarity (and perhaps\nalso in terms of their tendencies to produce various emotional\neffects), then these characterizations may qualify as platitudinous,\neven though they would have to be elicited by a kind of\n\u201cSocratic questioning\u201d.\n\nThere are limits to this strategy, however (see Section 5.5.1 on the\n\u201cinverted spectrum\u201d problem), which seem to leave two\noptions for analytic functionalists: fight \u2013 that is, deny that\nit\u2019s coherent to suppose that there exist the distinctions that\nthe critics suggest, or switch \u2013 that is, embrace another\nversion of functionalism in which the characterizations of mental\nstates, though not platitudinous, can provide information rich enough\nto individuate the states in question. To switch, however, would be to\ngive up the benefits (if any) of a theory that offers\nmeaning-preserving translations of our mental state terms.\n\nThere has been significant skepticism, however, about whether\nany functionalist theory \u2013 analytic or empirical\n\u2013 can capture what seems to be the distinctive qualitative\ncharacter of experiential states such as color perceptions, pains, and\nother bodily sensations; these questions will be addressed in section\n5.5 below.\n",
