    "main_text": "Baudelaire and the Modern\n7. Baudelaire and the Modern\n\nBenjamin\u2019s thinking of \u2018the modern\u2019 [die Moderne]\nis his most important theoretical contribution to the historical study\nof cultural forms. Frequently mistranslated in early English-language\neditions of his writings as \u2018modernism\u2019, and still often\nrendered as \u2018modernity\u2019 (although Benjamin tended to\nretain Baudelaire\u2019s coinage, la modernit\u00e9, when making\nthat reference), die Moderne designates both a formal\ntemporal structure and the diverse range of its historical\ninstances\u2014past and present. Baudelaire is the main writer\nthrough whom Benjamin thought \u2018the modern\u2019; not as might\nbe expected, with reference to the canonical account\nof modernit\u00e9 in \u2018The Painter of Modern\nLife\u2019 (1859/60), but with regard to what Benjamin called the\n\u2018theory\u2019 of the modern first set down in \u2018The Salon\nof 1845\u2019: \u201cthe advent of the true new (die Heraufkunft\ndes wahrhaft Neunen)\u201d (SW 4, 45\u20136, translation\namended; GS 1.2, 580).\u00a0\nIn Baudelaire\u2019s \u2018The Painter\u2019 essay, modernit\u00e9\nfamously denotes \u2018the ephemeral, the fugitive, the\ncontingent\u2019. It is associated with transitoriness as the\ngeneralized social instantiation of the temporality of the modern, in\nthe capitalist metropolis. In contrast to transitoriness as such,\nhowever, Benjamin was first and foremost (politically and\nphilosophically) interested in \u2018the new\u2019, in its\n\u2018advent\u2019 or historical becoming, and in its quality as\nnewness or novelty (the newness of the new), in a way that was\nconceptually distinct from the conventional opposition of the\n\u2018modern\u2019 to the \u2018ancient\u2019\u2014which\nBaudelaire notoriously retained. As a result, Benjamin was consequently\nalso interested in what the German sociologist Max Weber would have\ncalled its \u2018routinization\u2019 (although Benjamin did not use\nthis vocabulary): the routinization accompanying the generalization of\nthe new as a mode of experience\u2014in fashion and boredom, in\nparticular\u2014and the formal structure of sameness involved in its\nrepetition. It is here that transitoriness enters the picture\u2014as \na result of the generalization of novelty. Baudelaire\nself-consciously embraced modernity with \u2018heroic effort\u2019,\nattempting, like the painter of modern life, to \u2018extract its epic\naspects\u2019 and \u2018distill the eternal from the\ntransitory\u2019; Benjamin, on the other hand, sought to understand it\nin order to find a way out of what he called its \u2018hell\u2019. He\npicked up on the relationship of the transitory to the eternal in\nBaudelaire\u2019s account of modernity, but first, he de-classicized\nthe notion of the \u2018eternal\u2019, refiguring it philosophically,\nand second, he rendered the relationship itself strictly dialectical:\nin the modern, it is transitoriness itself that is eternalized.\nThus, Benjamin did not so much take over and update Baudelaire\u2019s\nportrayal of modernity as read it \u2018symptomatically\u2019 (in\nLouis Althusser\u2019s sense), or more precisely, allegorically, in order\nto uncover beneath it the experience of the transformation of\nhistorical time by the commodity form.  Baudelaire was able to\ngrasp this experience, according to Benjamin, through the\ncontradictory historical temporality that structured his work: at once\nresolutely modern yet, in its poetic form (lyric), already\nanachronistic. Benjamin similarly valued the disjunctive historical\ntemporality of Kafka\u2019s fables: their status as parables after the\n\u2018end of storytelling\u2019. But whereas Kafka was for Benjamin\n\u201cthe figure of a failure\u201d (BS, 226)\u2014the inevitable\nfailure of an attempt to translate the experience [Erlebnis]\nof modernity into the language of tradition\n(Judaism)\u2014Baudelaire\u2019s poetry was able to convey the intensity\nof the experience of modernity through the very tension between that\nexperience and his chosen, lyrical means; not merely negatively (like\nKafka), but via the way in which modernity transformed those means. In\nparticular, the lyric allowed Baudelaire to register the full effect\nof the temporality of the modern on the dissolution of subjectivity,\nand the fact that it consequently \u201ctakes a heroic constitution\nto live the modern [die Moderne]\u201d (SW 4, 44,\ntranslation amended; GS 1.2, 577). The extraction of the metropolitan\n\u2018motifs\u2019 for which Benjamin\u2019s reading of Baudelaire is\njustly famous\u2014the bohemian, the flaneur, the prostitute, the\ngambler, the ragpicker\u2014are the figures via which this structure\nof experience appears. Primary within Baudelaire, they are nonetheless\nmethodologically secondary for Benjamin, as he explained to Adorno:\n\u201cI only have to insert [them] in the appropriate place\u201d\n(BA, 90). Baudelaire had found a method\u2014what he called\n\u2018correspondences\u2019\u2014which reflectively incorporated\nthe anachronism of the lyric form into his work. Benjamin appropriated\nthis method, with its dissociated \u2018ritual elements\u2019 (SW 4,\n333), to read Baudelaire himself.  In the essay \u2018Some Motifs in\nBaudelaire\u2019, correspondences of temporal structure, experienced\nas \u2018shock\u2019, link the machine, the film, the crowd, and the\ngame of chance: \n\n\n\nWhat determines the rhythm of production on a conveyor\nbelt is the same thing that underlies the rhythm of reception in the\nfilm. \u2026 The shock experience [Chockerlebnis] which the\npasser-by has in the crowd corresponds to the isolated\n\u2018experiences\u2019 of the worker at his machine. \u2026 The\njolt in the movement of a machine is like the so-called coup in a game\nof chance\u2026. (SW 4, 328\u201330)\nA single repetitive and dissociated formal temporal structure is\ndetected beneath the rich array of phenomenological forms presented in\nBaudelaire\u2019s poetry: \u201cthe price for which the sensation of\nthe modern could be had: the disintegration of the aura in shock\nexperience\u201d. (SW 4, 343, translation amended; GS 1.2, 653) \n\nFurthermore, this interpretative key, the experience of shock, is\nitself understood through a series of theoretical correspondences\nwithin Benjamin\u2019s own present; primarily, that between\nProust\u2019s \u2018involuntary memory\u2019 and Freud\u2019s\ntheory of consciousness. This theoretical correspondence is read in the\nlight of the \u2018shell shock\u2019 first diagnosed during the First\nWorld War, about which Benjamin had previously written in his\nreflections on Ernst Junger in his 1930 review essay, \u2018Theories\nof German Fascism\u2019 (SW 2, 312\u2013321). The connection of the\nmodern to fascism does not appear solely through the thematic of the\nfalse restoration of the aura, but also within the process of its\ndisintegration by shock. (Structurally, the shock of the crowd is\n\u2018like\u2019 shell shock.) Baudelaire is thus not merely the\nprivileged writer for the advent of the theory of the modern, but the\none in whose work the nineteenth century appears most clearly as the\nfore-life of the present. However, if it was through Baudelaire that\nBenjamin grasped the structure of the temporality of the\n\u2018modern\u2019, it was through Nietzsche and Blanqui that he\nexplored its ambiguous historical meaning, via the way in which their\nphilosophies reflect the transformation of the new by the commodity\ninto the \u2018ever selfsame\u2019. \u201cJust as in the seventeenth\ncentury it is allegory that becomes the canon of dialectical images, in\nthe nineteenth century it is novelty\u201d (AP, 11):\u00a0 \u201cThe\ncommodity has taken the place of the allegorical mode of\napprehension.\u201d (SW 4, 188) \n\nIt is the fragment \u2018Central Park\u2019 that most clearly\nreveals the consequences of Benjamin\u2019s reading of Baudelaire for his\nconcept of history: the modern completely transforms the possibilities\nfor the experience of history. On the one hand, it de-historicizes\nexperience, wresting it away from the temporal continuities of\ntradition. On the other hand, a messianic structure\u2014an opening\nof history to something outside of time\u2014reasserts itself within\nthe still life [nature mort] of modernity\u2019s restless\nsameness. This is Benjamin\u2019s famous \u2018dialectics at a\nstandstill\u2019 (Tiedemann, 1982). It transforms the historical\nnaturalism of the baroque, analyzed in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play (Section 4, above), in a futural direction. In\nparticular, it involves a prioritization of the interruptive stasis of\nthe image over the continuity of temporal succession. In fact,\nBenjamin maintained: \u201cThe concept of historical time forms an\nantithesis to the idea of a temporal continuum\u201d (SW 4, 407).]\n \n",
