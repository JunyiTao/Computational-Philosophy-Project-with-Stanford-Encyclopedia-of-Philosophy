    "main_text": "Rational choice theory || Collective rationality and social choice\n5.2 Collective rationality and social choice\n\nAlthough societies are very different from individuals, they have\nmechanisms to evaluate alternatives and make choices, and their\nevaluations and choices may be rational or irrational. It is not,\nhowever, obvious, what principles of rationality should govern the\nchoices and evaluations of society. Transitivity is one plausible\ncondition. It seems that a society that chooses X when faced\nwith the alternatives X or Y, Y when faced\nwith the alternatives Y or Z and Z when\nfaced with the alternatives X or Z either has had a\nchange of heart or is choosing irrationally. Yet, purported\nirrationalities such as these can easily arise from standard\nmechanisms that aim to link social choices and individual preferences.\nSuppose there are three individuals in the society. Individual One\nranks the alternatives X, Y, Z. Individual\nTwo ranks them Y, Z, X. Individual Three\nranks them Z, X, Y. If decisions are made\nby pairwise majority voting, X will be chosen from the pair\n(X, Y), Y will be chosen from (Y,\nZ), and Z will be chosen from (X,\nZ). Clearly this is unsettling, but are possible cycles in\nsocial choices irrational?\n\nSimilar problems affect what one might call the logical coherence of\nsocial judgments (List and Pettit 2002). Suppose society consists of\nthree individuals who make the following judgments concerning the\ntruth or falsity of the propositions P and Q and\nthat social judgment follows the majority.\n\n\n\u00a0\nP\nif P then Q\nQ \n\nIndividual 1\ntrue\ntrue\ntrue \n\nIndividual 2\nfalse\ntrue\nfalse \n\nIndividual 3\ntrue\nfalse\nfalse \n\nSociety\ntrue\ntrue\nfalse \n\n\nThe judgments of each of the individuals are consistent with the\nprinciples of logic, while social judgments violate them. How\nimportant is it that social judgments be consistent with the\nprinciples of logic?\n\nAlthough social choice theory in this way bears on questions of social\nrationality, most work in social choice theory explores the\nconsequences of principles of rationality coupled with explicitly\nethical constraints. The seminal contribution is Kenneth\nArrow\u2019s impossibility theorem (1963, 1967). Arrow assumes that\nboth individual preferences and social preferences are complete and\ntransitive and that the method of forming social preferences (or making\nsocial choices) issues in some social preference ranking or social\nchoice for any possible profile of\nindividual preferences. In addition, Arrow imposes a weak unanimity\ncondition: if everybody prefers X to Y, then\nY must not be socially preferred. Third, he requires that there be no\ndictator whose preferences determine social preferences or choices irrespective of\nthe preferences of anybody else. Lastly, he imposes the condition that\nthe social preference between X and Y should depend on\nhow individuals rank X and Y and on nothing else.\nArrow then proved the surprising result that no method of relating\nsocial and individual preferences can satisfy all these\nconditions!\n\nIn the sixty years since Arrow wrote, there has been a plethora of\nwork in social choice theory, a good deal of which is arguably of\ngreat importance to ethics. For example, John Harsanyi proved that if\nindividual preferences and social evaluations both satisfy the axioms\nof expected utility theory (with shared or objective probabilities)\nand that social preferences conform to unanimous individual\npreferences, then social evaluations are determined by a weighted sum\nof individual utilities (1955, 1977a). Matthew Adler (2012) has\nextended an approach like Harsanyi\u2019s to demonstrate that a form\nof weighted utilitarianism, which prioritizes the interests of those\nwho are worse off, uniquely satisfies a longer list of rational and\nethical constraints. When there are instead disagreements in\nprobability assignments, there is an impossibility result: the\nunanimity condition implies that for some profiles of individual\npreferences, social evaluations will not satisfy the axioms of\nexpected utility theory (Hammond 1983, Seidenfeld, et al.\n1989, Mongin 1995). For further discussion of social choice theory and\nthe relevance of utility theory to social evaluation, see the entry on\n social choice theory, Sen (1970)\nand for recent reappraisals Fleurbaey (2007) and Adler (2012).\n",
