For example, statistical analysis shows that suicide rates\ndiffered radically depending on social factors, (e.g. religious\nbackground, gender, marital status etc.) This analysis led to the\npossibility of social science being taken in a quantitative direction.\nEven if every individual commits suicide as a result of psychological\nfactors, the statistical facts about the \u201creasons\u201d for\nsuicide and how they change with place and over time are distinctly\nsocial. One question then is whether one should be naturalist about\nsuch social facts. If so, how could naturalism be reconciled with the\nclaim that social facts are dynamic and changing in so far as they\nconcern human beings in social interactions?\n\nBecause social kinds are distinctly anthropocentric, some theorists\nclaim that the only plausible view we can hold is some form of\nconstructivism about them. Hacking (1995, 1999) argues that in social\ncontexts the object of classification itself changes in being\nclassified. The fact that the people being classified are conscious\nmakes for dynamic interactions between the classification and the\nclassified. The latter may resist or embrace certain classifications\n(\u2018child abuser\u2019, \u2018hip\u2019) and modify their\nbehaviour accordingly. This leads to a change in the extensions of\nthe relevant kind concepts. Furthermore, as the extensions change, the\ncriteria for membership may change also. Many of our classifications\nin social science are evaluative. A social situation looks deviant\nfrom the norm and people make an evaluative judgment about this.\nSometimes this means that people passively accept what experts say\nabout them, and see themselves in that light. But feedback can direct\nitself in many ways. Alternatively, some people seek to reclassify\nthemselves. Thus, classification in social science is interactive.\nHacking argues that this is in marked contrast to the indifferent\nkinds that are found in natural science. An electron is indifferent to\nbeing classified as an electron.\n\nPace Hacking, Khalidi (2010) argues that in fact the contrast\nbetween natural and social kinds is not so stark: even many chemical\nkinds would not have been instantiated in the world were it not for\nthe fact that a scientist conceived of them and acted on that\nconception. So in both cases the existence of a classification scheme\ncan cause changes to the extension of the kinds in question. The\ndifference between natural kinds and social kinds is a difference of\nthe degree of control we have over the object of classification. In\nthe chemical domain, for example, the nature of the phenomena\nthemselves imposes greater restrictions on the kinds that we can\ncreate. (See also Cooper 2004.)\n",
