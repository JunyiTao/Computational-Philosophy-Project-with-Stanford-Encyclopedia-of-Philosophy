    "main_text": "Clarifications || Languages\n1.1 Languages\n\nThe principle of compositionality is normally taken to quantify over\nexpressions of some particular language L:\n\n(C\u2032)For every\ncomplex expression e in L, the meaning of e in\nL is determined by the structure of e in L and\nthe meanings of the constituents of e in L.\n\n\nQuestions of structure and constituency are settled by the\nsyntax of L, while the meanings of simple expressions\nare given by the lexical semantics of L.\nCompositionality entails (although on many elaborations is not\nentailed by) the claim that syntax plus lexical semantics determines\nthe entire semantics for L.\n\nIt makes a big difference whether L is a natural or an\nartificial language. Syntactic and semantic questions about a natural\nlanguage are settled by and large through empirical investigation;\nsyntactic and semantic questions about an artificial language are\nsettled usually by checking what the appropriate stipulations are.\nPrima facie, natural languages might turn out not to be\ncompositional, whereas many artificial languages were designed to meet\nsuch a requirement. (Compositionality is a bonus when it comes to\nproof-checking in computer languages, or inductive proofs in logical\ncalculi.) Unless explicitly noted, talk of compositionality is to be\ntaken as talk of compositionality of some particular natural language,\nor of natural languages in general.\n\nIf thought is a kind of language, we can raise the question whether it\nis compositional. Thought would not have to be much like\nSwahili or the language of set theory for the question to make sense,\nbut we do need the assumptions that thoughts have meanings (and so,\npresumably, are not themselves meanings) and that they have meaningful\nconstituents. These assumptions follow from\n the language of thought hypothesis\n (see entry). Those who reject this hypothesis may still speak of the\ncompositionality of thought\u2014but only in an extended sense.\n\nWhat would such an extended sense be? The key to generalizing\ncompositionality for non-linguistic representational systems is to\nrelax the syntactic ideas of constituency and structure. Consider, for\nexample, the No-Left-Turn sign:\n\n\n\n\nThis could be viewed as a complex sign decomposable into meaningful\nfeatures\u2014the shape, the color pattern, the arrow, etc. These\nfeatures are the analogues of simple expressions: they appear in many\nother complex signs and they appear to contribute more or less\nuniformly to their meanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have an initial grip on what counts as a constituent and how\nconstituents compose we can legitimately raise the question whether\nthis system of representations is\n compositional.[2]\n We may even be able to answer\n it.[3]\n\nThere is a major debate within the philosophy of mind between\nproponents of classical cognitive architecture and proponents of\n connectionism\n (see entry). The debate is typically presented as a debate about\ncompositionality, but it is not exactly about that. The issue tends to\nbe whether there are such things as meaningful constituents of thought\n(perhaps in the extended sense in which traffic signs can be said to\nhave meaningful constituents), and if there are, whether these\ncontribute the same thing (presumably their meaning) to all thoughts\nin which they occur. If the answer to the first question is negative,\nthe question of compositionality does not arise. If the answer to the\nfirst question is positive, the second is independent of\ncompositionality. (It could be that thought-constituents contribute\nalways the same thing to a thought of which they are constituents, but\nthese contributions, even together with the way the constituents are\ncombined, severely underdetermine the meaning of the thought. And it\ncould be that thought-constituents contribute different things to\ndifferent thoughts\u2014depending, perhaps, on the surroundings of\nthe thinking\u2014but these variable contributions, plus the way the\nconstituents are combined, fully determine the meaning of the\nthought.) The debate about connectionism is more closely related to\nthe question whether reverse compositionality holds (cf.\n section 1.6.4.)\n\n",
