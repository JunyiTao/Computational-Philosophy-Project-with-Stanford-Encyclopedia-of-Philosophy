    "main_text": "Physical Theory and Biological Concepts || Elements, Principles, Matter, Pneuma\n6.1 Elements, Principles, Matter, Pneuma\nThe fundamental constituents or elements (stoicheia) of physical bodies are\u2014theoretically\u2014earth, air, fire and water. However, it is also legitimate to state that the elements are the hot, the cold, the wet and the dry; and indeed it is this latter model which is of the greatest explanatory value for Galen, and which he employs almost universally in his accounts of bodies and their physical change (for example in Temp., and more generally in his work on health, disease and pharmacology). He tends to present the difference between the two forms of analysis as philosophically unimportant: it is just a question of whether one prefers to talk in terms of qualities (poiot\u0113tes, i.e., the hot, etc.) or of bodies (s\u014dmata, i.e., fire, etc.). However, the formulation in terms of the cosmic elements (fire, earth, air, water) is important for Galen, because it is central to his argument that the only coherent way in which a theory of elements in the body can be understood is in terms of the extremes of qualities; and, further, that (since, e.g., the extreme of hot is fire) such an understanding automatically entails the equivalence of those elements in the body with the elements outside the body, in the cosmos: fire, earth, air and water.\nIn fact, there is some complexity in Galen\u2019s precise view of elements, and in particular as to the relationship of fire, air, earth, water (which henceforward, for convenience, I shall term \u201celement-bodies\u201d) with hot, cold, wet, dry (henceforward, \u201celement-qualities\u201d); see Hankinson 2017; Singer 2021a. Although at times he uses the term stoicheia for both element-bodies and element-qualities, in his most detailed account, in his Commentary on Hippocrates\u2019 Nature of the Human Being (HNH) (I.3; cf. Hipp. Elem. 6, esp. 112\u201316), he clarifies that properly speaking the former are elements, stoicheia, in the sense that they cannot be physically separated into anything else, but that they are further conceptually divisible into different \u201cprinciples\u201d (archai): specifically, each of the element-bodies (stoicheia) must be understood as the outcome of the reception into a substrate, quality-less matter, of the extreme of a particular quality (that is, the element-qualities). Galen\u2019s element theory seems in many respects closely modelled on Aristotle\u2019s; but the view presented here of qualities entering or informing otherwise unformed matter may be seen as ultimately Platonic, based on the conception of matter and the receptacle in the Timaeus, while the terminology of \u201cquality-less\u201d (apoios) which he sometimes uses in this context is Stoic in origin (e.g. HNH I.3, 18; cf. the \u201cmatter (hul\u0113) which underlies all the elements\u201d at Hipp. Elem. 6, 114). The presence of an analogous concept is much less clear in Aristotle. Moreover, the precise relationship between specific element-bodies and specific element-qualities is somewhat confusing, both in terms of Galen\u2019s explicit discussions of it and in terms of the relationship of his model to the Aristotelian and Stoic ones.\nTo summarize in an interpretively difficult area: Stoic theory has each element-body corresponding to the extreme of one element-quality (fire to the hot, etc.); Galen not only seems at times to highlight such one-to-one correspondences, focussing on the element-bodies as instantiating the element-qualities in their \u201cuncombined and unmixed\u201d states; such associations also seem epistemologically or heuristically crucial for the establishment of certain features of the human body and their relationship with the external world: the theoretical extreme of hot automatically leads one to the concept of fire, for example. On the other hand, it seems clear from certain passages in Hipp. Elem. and HNH that Galen remains committed to the Aristotelian view (as outlined in De generatione et corruptione), whereby each element-body arises from a pairing of element-qualities. (There also seems to be some vacillation as to which quality is present in its extreme form: is the extreme of moisture instantiated by water (the Stoic view) or by air (the Aristotelian view) \u2013 and relatedly is air hot or cold?)\nOne should also consider the distinction between the more active and the more passive elements. This (again Aristotelian) distinction seems not, in general, to be a feature of the Galenic elements; yet it does play a role in the account of the purposive construction of the body, whereby the hot and the cold function as instruments, the dry and the wet as mere material, for the Craftsman (see above, \u00a75.2).\nFinally, some account must be given of pneuma. This concept\u2014literally \u201cbreath\u201d, but endowed with various kinds of technical significance and explanatory power in the previous philosophical and medical traditions\u2014stands in an important, though somewhat problematic, relation to the theories of both elements and the soul. Its precise connection with the former is not made entirely clear, and pneuma is not standardly mentioned in Galen\u2019s various accounts of the constituents of the body and the changes which it undergoes in health and disease. However, it plays an important role in his physiology, especially in PHP and UP. Here, two forms of pneuma, the \u201cvital\u201d (z\u00f5tikon) and the \u201cpsychic\u201d (psuchikon) correspond to two major organs and systems in the body. Vital pneuma communicates vital (involuntary) function and tension through the arteries, psychic pneuma communicates perception and voluntary motion from and to the brain, through the nerves. It is possible here again to posit a Stoic influence in the central role accorded to pneuma in the account of vital, and especially psychological, function. Galen even floats the notion of the identity of soul and pneuma; that, however, is not his considered view of the matter, which is rather that the pneuma functions as the soul\u2019s \u201cfirst instrument\u201d (see \u00a77.2 below). Moreover, Galen\u2019s theory in this area is fundamentally anatomical in nature, and certainly does not adopt Stoic metaphysical views in this area; its connections with the anatomically based medical theories of Herophilus and Erasistratus seem much more relevant than that more abstract and metaphysically based understanding of pneuma and its function (see Singer 2020b; further von Staden 2000; Rocca 2020; van der Eijk 2020).\n",
