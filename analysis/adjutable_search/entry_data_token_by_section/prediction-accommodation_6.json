    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || The Fudging Explanation\n6.2 The Fudging Explanation\n\nIt was noted above that ad hoc hypotheses stand under suspicion for\nvarious reasons, one of which was that a hypothesis that was proposed\nto resolve a particular difficulty may not cohere well with the theory\nit purports to save or relevant background\n beliefs.[9]\n This could result from the fact that there is no obvious way to\nresolve the difficulty in a way that is wholly \u2018natural\u2019\nfrom the standpoint of the theory itself or operative criteria of\ntheory choice. For example, the phlogiston theory claimed that\nsubstances emitted phlogiston while burning. However, it was\nestablished that some substances actually gained weight while burning.\nTo accommodate the latter phenomenon it was proposed that phlogiston\nhad negative weight\u2014but the latter hypothesis was clearly ad hoc\nin the sense of failing to cohere with the background belief that\nsubstances simply do not have negative weight, and with the knowledge\nthat many objects lost weight when burned (Partington & McKie\n1938a: 33\u201338).\n\nThus the \u2018fudging explanation\u2019 defends predictivism by\npointing out that the process of accommodation lends itself to the\nproposal of hypotheses that do not cohere naturally with operative\nconstraints on theory choice, while successful predictions are immune\nfrom this worry (Lipton 1990, 1991: Ch. 8). Of course, it is an\nimportant question whether scientists actually rely on the fact that\nevidence was predicted (or accommodated) in their assessment of\ntheories\u2014if a theory was fudged to accommodate some datum,\ncouldn\u2019t the scientist simply note that the fudged theory\nsuffers a defect of coherence and pay no attention to whether the data\nwas accommodated or predicted? Some argue, however that scientists are\nimperfect judges of such coherence\u2014a scientist who accommodates\nsome datum may think his accommodation is fully coherent, while his\npeers may have a more accurate and objective view that it is not. The\nscientist\u2019s \u2018assessed support\u2019 of his proposed\naccommodation may thus fail to coincide with its \u2018objective\nsupport\u2019, and the scientist might rely on the fact that his\nevidence was accommodated as evidence that it was fudged (or\nconversely, that his evidence was predicted as evidence that it was\nnot fudged; Lipton 1991: 150f).\n",
