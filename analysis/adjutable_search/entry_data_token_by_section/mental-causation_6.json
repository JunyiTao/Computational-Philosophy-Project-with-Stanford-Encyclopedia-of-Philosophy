    "main_text": "The Problem of Interaction || The Completeness of the Physical\n2.4 The Completeness of the Physical\n\nA fourth version of the Problem of Interaction is related to the\nthird, but, because it is more prominent in the contemporary\nliterature, especially in some of the \u201cproperty-based\u201d\nproblems we examine below, we will develop this last version at\ngreater length. The first premise is:\n\nThe Completeness of the Physical: Every physical effect has a\nsufficient physical cause.\n\nWhen you trace the causal history of any physical effect\u2014that\nis, of anything physical that has a cause\u2014you will never need to\nappeal to anything non-physical. The physical universe contains within\nitself the resources for a full causal explanation of any of its\n(caused) elements, and in this sense is \u201ccomplete\u201d. The\npoint applies, then, to whatever might occur to or within our bodies.\nAny instance of bodily behavior has a sufficient physical cause, which\nitself has a sufficient physical cause, and so on. In tracing the\ncausal history of what we do, we need never appeal to anything\nnon-physical.\n\nThis principle appears frequently in the mental causation literature\nunder a number of labels: most common are variations of\nCompleteness of the Physical (Crane 1995, 2001; Papineau\n1993, 2000; O\u2019Connor and Churchill 2010) or Physical\nClosure (Crane 1992; Baker 1993; Melnyk 2003; Kim 2005).\nWe\u2019ll call it Completeness for short.\n\nLabels aside, several versions of the premise appear in the\nliterature, and they can differ in strength. Note that the principle\nas formulated says nothing about whether the non-physical can affect\nthe physical; a strengthened version prohibits this. (Closure\nis sometimes reserved for this stronger principle: LePore and Loewer\n1987; Kim 1998, p. 40; Marcus 2005; compare Strong Causal\nClosure in Montero 2003.) An even more ambitious version blocks\nthe non-physical from being cause or effect; such is\nsuggested in Davidson\u2019s work (see \u00a75.1 and McLaughlin 1989,\nwho uses Physical Comprehensiveness for this thesis.) As for\nweaker versions, Completeness could be limited to physical\neffects within the human body without affecting its relevance to the\ncurrent topic. Note also that the principle is apparently committed to\ndeterministic physical causation; a weakened version permits\nprobabilistic causes. (For complications with such a weakening, see\nMontero 2003, and for other challenges with formulating\nCompleteness, Lowe 2000; Gibb 2015.)\n\nFor simplicity, we stay with the principle as formulated at the\noutset. Why think that it\u2019s true? Perhaps it is a conceptual\ntruth: for an effect to be physical is, at least in part, for it to\nhave a physical cause. This defense turns on the proper analysis of\nthe concept physical, itself the subject of a contentious\nliterature (see\n physicalism).\n Here we simply note that the principle does not seem analytic; it\nappears to be a substantive, empirical claim about the causal\nstructure of the universe. (For more on the conceptual defense, see\nCrane 1991; Papineau 1991, 1993, \u00a71.9; Lowe 1996, p. 56.)\n\nIt\u2019s natural, then, to look to science for a defense, and\nespecially physics (or physiology). Appeals to \u201ccurrent physical\ntheory\u201d (Antony and Levine 1997, p. 100), \u201cthe development\nof the sciences\u201d (LePore and Loewer 1987, p. 630), and\n\u201cphysics textbooks\u201d (Melnyk 2003, p. 289) are common, but\nwhat exactly in physical science supports the premise? An appeal to\nthe conservation laws (2.3) might be thought to generate one such\nargument. Another argument is the no-gap argument. (See, for example\nMelnyk 2003, pp. 288\u201390; Papineau 1993, pp. 31\u201332).\nPhysics has been hugely successful in identifying the causes of\nvarious kinds of physical event. To do so physicists have only needed\nto appeal to physical events. Not once have they had to appeal to\nsui generis mental events. Without doubt the causal account\nthat physics provides of physical events contains gaps. But the\ncrucial point is that is highly unlikely that physics will ever need\nto appeal to sui generis mental causes to fill these\ngaps\u2014or so proponents of the no-gap argument claim. A similar\nno-gap argument can be presented at the level of neurophysiology.\n(See, for example, Melnyk 2003, p.187).\n\nWe will look at challenges to Completeness in a moment, but\nnote for now that the premise by itself does not preclude the efficacy\nof souls. Even if every physical effect has a sufficient physical\ncause, some physical effects might have non-physical causes as well.\nThis latest version of the Problem of Interaction thus requires a\nsecond premise:\n\nNo Overdetermination: There is no systematic\noverdetermination of physical effects.\n\nThis principle enjoys wide support in the literature. It is said that\npostulating systematic overdetermination in this context is\n\u201cabsurd\u201d (Kim 1993a, p. 281), one of the\n\u201cnonstarters\u201d in the mental causation debate (Kim 1998, p.\n65). But why? Perhaps it just looks like bad engineering (Schiffer\n1987, p. 148). Or maybe the problem is that it would involve an\n\u201cintolerable coincidence\u201d (Melnyk 2003, p. 291): every\ntime you act, there are two independent causal processes\u2014one\nfrom your brain, another from your soul\u2014converging on the same\neffect.\n\nWith the two premises now in place, the Problem of Interaction in our\nfinal version is straightforward. Assume for reductio that\nour souls routinely cause behavior. By Completeness, such\neffects also have sufficient physical causes, so behavior is\nsystematically overdetermined. But this contradicts No\nOverdetermination. The dualist\u2019s options would then seem to\nbe severely limited. One is to embrace epiphenomenalism, a doctrine on\nwhich the mental, while caused by the physical, exerts no\n\u201cdownward\u201d causal influence in return. A more radical\noption, parallelism, depicts bodies and souls as running in tandem,\nwith no causal influence in either direction.\n\nThe two premises can, however, be challenged. Start with\nCompleteness. Baker (1993), not herself a Cartesian dualist,\nargues that if the principle threatens to undermine our ordinary (and\nscientific) explanatory practices\u2014many of which cite the\nmental\u2014it\u2019s Completeness that has to go.\nEntrenched explanatory practices trump any abstract metaphysical\nprinciples with which they might conflict (see also \u00a7\u00a76.3,\n7.5). Others argue that physical science, far from supporting the\nprinciple, may in fact undermine it. Hendry (2006) finds indications\nof \u201cdownward causation\u201d in chemistry, while Stapp (2005)\nculls evidence from contemporary physics suggesting that there are,\ncontrary to Completeness, causal gaps in the physical world,\ngaps filled in by the mental (see also Sturgeon 1998; Davies 2006).\nEmergentists in general deny the principle, either on scientific\ngrounds or by appeal to our conscious experiences of agency (see\n emergent properties,\n esp. \u00a74). And although the death of emergentism has been\ndeclared more than once on empirical grounds (McLaughlin 1992;\nPapineau 2000), the view continues to attract philosophers and\nscientists. (See Wilson 2021 and the contributions to Clayton and\nDavies 2006; Bedau and Humphreys 2008; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010;\nPaoletti and Orilia 2017; and Gibb, Hendry and Lancaster 2019.)\n\nNo Overdetermination has been targeted as well. Mills (1996),\nfor example, defends mental\u2013physical overdetermination as the\nmost plausible route for the dualist to take. Overdetermination is\nplausible, the reasoning goes, if for any behavioral effect\nB, both a non-physical (mental) cause M and physical\ncause P satisfy the following counterfactual conditionals\n(among others):\n\nIf M had occurred in the absence of P,\nB would still have occurred.\nIf P had occurred in the absence of M,\nB would still have occurred.\n\n\nIf the dualist can reasonably claim that (1) and (2) are true, this\nwill make a strong prima facie case for overdetermination.\nAlong different lines, Lowe (2003) presents a model of dualist\ninteraction on which, owing to systematic mind\u2013body\ndependencies, overdetermination is not the intolerable coincidence\nworrying opponents of dualism. And more generally, the ban on\nsystematic overdetermination has come under increased scrutiny in the\ncontext of the Exclusion Problem, to be discussed in \u00a76.\n",
