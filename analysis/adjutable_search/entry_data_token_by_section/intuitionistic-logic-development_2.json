    "main_text": "Brouwer\u2019s Views on Logic in 1907 and 1908 || Mathematics, Language, and Logic\n2.1 Mathematics, Language, and Logic\n\nIn his dissertation (1907), Brouwer presents his conception of the\nrelations between mathematics, language, and logic. Both the\nintuitionistic view of logic as essentially sterile, and the existence\nof results in intuitionistic logic that are incompatible with\nclassical logic, depend essentially on that conception.\n\nFor Brouwer, pure mathematics consists primarily in the act of making\ncertain mental constructions (Brouwer 1907: 99n.1 [1975:\n 61n.1]).[3]\n The point of departure for these constructions is the intuition of\nthe flow of\n time.[4]\n This intuition, when divested from all sensuous content, allows us to\nperceive the form \u201cone thing and again a thing, and a continuum\nin between\u201d. Brouwer calls this form, which unites the discrete\nand the continuous, \u201cthe empty two-ity\u201d. It is the basic\nintuition of mathematics; the discrete cannot be reduced to the\ncontinuous, nor the continuous to the discrete (Brouwer 1907: 8 [1975:\n17]).\n\nAs time flows on, an empty two-ity can be taken as one part of a new\ntwo-ity, and so on. The development of intuitionistic mathematics\nconsists in the exploration which specific constructions the empty\ntwo-ity and its self-unfolding or iteration allows and which not:\n\n\nThe only possible foundation of mathematics must be sought in this\nconstruction under the obligation carefully to watch which\nconstructions intuition allows and which not. (Brouwer 1907: 77 [1975:\n52])\n\n\nor, in Heyting\u2019s words,\n\n\n[Brouwer\u2019s] construction of intuitionist mathematics is nothing\nmore nor less than an investigation of the utmost limits which the\nintellect can attain in its self-unfolding. (Heyting 1968A: 314)\n\n\nBrouwer and other intuitionists have shown how on this basis\narithmetic, real analysis, and topology can be constructed. Moreover,\nBrouwer considers any exact thought that is not itself mathematics an\napplication of mathematics. For whenever we consciously think of two\nthings in an exact manner, that is, think them together while keeping\nthem separate, we do so, according to Brouwer, by projecting the\ndiscrete parts of an empty two-ity onto them (Brouwer 1907: 179n.1\n[1975: 97n.1]).\n\nBrouwer takes the intuition of time to belong to pre-linguistic\nconsciousness. Mathematics, therefore, is essentially languageless. It\nis the activity of effecting non-linguistic constructions out of\nsomething that is not of a linguistic nature. Using language we can\ndescribe our mathematical activities, but these activities themselves\ndo not depend on linguistic elements, and nothing that is true about\nmathematical constructional activities owes its truth to some\nlinguistic fact. Linguistic objects such as axioms may serve to\ndescribe a mental construction, but they cannot bring it into being.\nFor this reason, certain axioms from classical mathematics are\nrejected by intuitionists, such as the completeness axiom for real\nnumbers, which says that if a non-empty set of real numbers has an\nupper bound, then it has a least upper bound: we know of no general\nmethod that would allow us to construct mentally the least upper bound\nwhose existence the axiom claims.\n\nAs Brouwer later put it, \u201cFormal language accompanies\nmathematics as a score accompanies a symphony by Bach or an oratorio\nby Handel\u201d. (Brouwer et al. 1937: 262; translation\n mine).[5]\n Correspondingly, establishing properties of formal systems may have\nmany uses, but ultimately has no foundational significance for\nmathematics. In a lecture from 1923, Brouwer expresses optimism about\nHilbert\u2019s proof theory, but denies that it would have\nsignificance for mathematics:\n\n\nWe need by no means despair of reaching this goal [of a consistency\nproof for formalized mathematics], but nothing of mathematical value\nwill thus be gained: an incorrect theory, even if it cannot be\ninhibited by any contradiction that would refute it, is none the less\nincorrect, just as a criminal policy is none the less criminal even if\nit cannot be inhibited by any court that would curb it. (Brouwer\n1924N: 3 [van Heijenoort 1967: 336])\n\n\nAt the same time, Brouwer was well aware of the practical need for\nlanguage, both in order to communicate mathematical results to others\nand to help ourselves in remembering and reconstructing our previous\nresults (Brouwer 1907: 169 [1975: 92]). Only an ideal mathematician\nwith perfect and unlimited memory would be able to practice pure\nmathematics without recourse to language (Brouwer 1933A2: 58 [van\nStigt 1990: 427]). Clearly, given these two practical functions of\nlanguage, the more precise the language is, the better.\n\nLogic, in this framework, seeks and systematizes certain patterns in\nthe linguistic recordings of our activities of mathematical\nconstruction. It is an application of mathematics to the language of\nmathematics. Specifically, logic studies the patterns that\ncharacterize valid inference. The aim is to establish general rules\noperating on statements about mathematical constructions such that, if\nthe original statements (the premises) convey a mathematical truth, so\nwill the statement obtained by applying the rule (the conclusion;\nBrouwer 1949C: 1243). What is preserved in an inference from given\npremises to a conclusion is therefore not, as in classical logic, a\nkind of possibly evidence-transcendent truth, but constructibility.\nThis view is quite explicit already in Brouwer\u2019s dissertation\n(Brouwer 1907: 125\u2013132, 159\u2013160 [1975: 72\u201375, 88]),\nbut a more memorable passage is in the paper from 1908:\n\n\nCan one, in the case of purely mathematical constructions and\ntransformations, temporarily neglect the presentation of the\nmathematical system that has been erected, and move in the\naccompanying linguistic building, guided by the principles of the\nsyllogism, of contradiction, and of tertium exclusum, always confident\nthat, by momentary evocation of the presentation of the mathematical\nconstructions suggested by this reasoning, each part of the discourse\ncould be justified? (Brouwer 1908C: 4 [van Atten & Sundholm 2017:\n40])\n\n\n(He then goes on to argue that the answer is \u201cyes\u201d for the\nprinciples of the syllogism and of contradiction, but, in general,\n\u201cno\u201d for the Principle of the Excluded Middle (PEM); more\non this below,\n section 2.4.)\n\nBut if a certain mathematical construction can be constructed out of\nanother one, this is a purely mathematical fact, and as such\nindependent of logic. Logic therefore is descriptive but not creative:\nby the use of logic, one will never obtain mathematical truths that\nare not obtainable by a direct mathematical construction (Brouwer\n1949C: 1243). Hence, in the development of intuitionistic mathematics,\nlogic can never play an essential role. It follows from\nBrouwer\u2019s view that logic is subordinate to mathematics. The\nclassical view that mathematics is subordinate to logic is closely\nrelated to the view that pure logic has no particular subject matter\nor domain, and is prior to all. From that perspective, Brouwer\u2019s\nconception of logic as dependent on mathematics will seem too\nrestrictive. But for Brouwer logic always presupposes mathematics,\nbecause in his view it is, like any exact thought, an application of\nmathematics.\n\nThe resulting linguistic system of logic may in turn be studied\nmathematically, even independently of the mathematical activities and\ntheir recordings that it was originally abstracted from. Iterating the\nprocess, an infinite hierarchy arises of mathematical activities,\ntheir linguistic recordings, and the mathematical study of these\nrecordings as linguistic objects independently of their original\nmeaning. Brouwer describes this hierarchy (in more detail than we have\ndone here) at the end of his dissertation (Brouwer 1907: 173ff), and\ncriticizes Hilbert for not respecting it. Of particular interest is\nthe distinction Brouwer makes between mathematics and\n\u201cmathematics of the second order\u201d (Brouwer 1907: 99n.1,\n173 [1975: 61n.1, 94]), where one instance of the latter is the\nmathematical study of the language of the former in abstraction from\nits original meaning; this way, Brouwer made fully explicit the\ndistinction between mathematics and (what became known as)\nmetamathematics (e.g., Hilbert 1923: 153). Later, Brouwer claimed\npriority for this distinction, adding in a footnote that he had\nexplained it to Hilbert in a series of conversations in 1909 (Brouwer\n1928A2: 375 [Mancosu 1998: 44n.1]).\n",
