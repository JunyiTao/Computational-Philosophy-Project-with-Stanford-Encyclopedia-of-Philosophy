    "main_text": "Psychology and Cognition || Species theory\n5.2 Species theory\n\n\nIn the Lectura Book II, q. 1, a. 2, Whether\nmotion and time are really distinct, FitzRalph makes a\ndigression while defending the species in medio theory and\nrefers to a respected person (valens) who had argued against\nthe theory. He also tells us that he himself once shared a similar\nopinion and gives the reason why.\n\n\nIt seems to me that if those people are not aware that the species\nin their eyes are just like the sounds in their ears, then they will\nnot believe that such things [as species] exist but will say that sight\nis seeing and that hearing is hearing and that illuminated air is light\n\u2013 and I once heard a very respected person (valens) say\nexactly this. Others say that every colour is light, and that every\ntaste is a mixture of the prime qualities, and that every smell is\ntaste \u2013 as indeed I believed once, holding that nothing existed except\nthe five prime qualities, namely the four elemental qualities and light\n\u2026 .\n\n\nThe valens in question could well be Ockham, since\nFitzRalph was old enough to have heard him speak before the former left\nOxford in 1324 (Maier 1959: 16). (Maier also discusses\nFitzralph\u2019s text in the context of the later debate regarding\nprimary and secondary qualities). Nor was FitzRalph alone in defending\nthe theory of the species in medio: \u201cOckham\u2019s\nattack on the species elicited an almost immediate and prolonged\nnegative response.\u201d (Tachau 1982: 395). Ockham\u2019s position\nwas criticized by John of Reading and also by Walter Chatton, Robert\nHolcot, William Crathorn, and Wodeham. Thus, FitzRalph found himself in\nthe company of many who would normally be seen as close to the position\nof Ockham. As Tachau concludes (1982: 443), \u201cin epistemology at\nany rate, there seems at Oxford to have been no school of\nOckhamistae.\u201d\n\n\nHowever, with FitzRalph\u2019s treatment of the topic there seems\nto be a shift from a concern with the species in medio to the\nspecies in memoria and this seems to have influenced the\nmanner of the treatment of the topic by Holcot and especially that of\nCrathorn who devotes much of his treatment to an analysis of\nFitzRalph\u2019s arguments (Dunne 2012; both Holcot and Crathorn\nlectured on the Sentences in the years 1330\u201332 around the time when\nFitzRalph was magister regens).\n",
