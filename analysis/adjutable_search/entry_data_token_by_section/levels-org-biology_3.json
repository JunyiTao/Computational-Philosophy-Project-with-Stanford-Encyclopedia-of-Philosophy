    "main_text": "Philosophical accounts of levels of organization || Levels of mechanisms\n2.2 Levels of mechanisms\n\nThe account of \u201clevels of mechanisms\u201d introduced by Bill\nBechtel (2008) and Carl Craver (2007) has in recent years become a\nstandard view of levels in philosophy of neuroscience. The context of\nthis account is the more general paradigm of \u201cnew\nmechanism\u201d (see the entry\n Mechanisms in Science).\n In levels of mechanisms, there are mechanisms at higher levels and\ntheir components at lower levels. The mechanistic account proposes a\ncontextualized conception (as opposed to the comprehensive conception\nof the layer-cake) that articulates levels in terms of constitutive\nparthood within a mechanism (Craver 2007: 188\u2013189; Kaplan 2015:\n20; see also Cummins 1975 for an early expression of this idea). This\napproach offers several advantages over the layer-cake account: For\none thing, it abandons the goal of providing a global or comprehensive\nunderstanding of levels that applies homogeneously to all systems in\nnature. Instead, the aim is to construe levels in a scientifically\ninformed manner whereby level demarcations only make sense on\ncase-based grounds (see also Love 2012 for a local approach to levels\nthat is not explicitly tied to the notion of a mechanism). The\nmechanistic account also completely eschews any tidy correspondence\nbetween the structure of the natural world and the structure of the\nnatural sciences: Levels of mechanisms are levels in nature,\nand there is no straightforward mapping from these levels to theories\nor fields of science (Craver 2007: 176). Finally, the mechanistic\naccount of levels supports a positive account of pluralistic,\nmultilevel explanation that emerges as an alternative to accounts of\nreductionism in biology (Craver 2005; cf. Brigandt 2010: 297).\n\nMore specifically, levels of mechanisms have been defined as\nfollows:\n\n\nIn levels of mechanisms, the relata are behaving mechanisms at higher\nlevels and their components at lower levels. \u2026 The interlevel\nrelationship is as follows: X\u2019s \u03a6-ing is at a lower\nmechanistic level than \u03a8-ing if and only if X\u2019s\n\u03a6-ing is a component in the mechanism for S\u2019s \u03a8-ing.\nLower level components are organized together to form higher-level\ncomponents. (Craver 2007: 189)\n\nWithin a mechanism, the relevant parts are \u2026 working\nparts\u2014the parts that perform the operations that enable the\nmechanism to realize the phenomenon of interest. These may be of\ndifferent sizes, but they are distinguished by the fact that they\nfigure in the functioning of the mechanism. It is the set of working\nparts that are organized and whose operations are coordinated to\nrealize the phenomenon of interest that constitute a level. (Bechtel\n2008: 146)\n\n\nSo far, these characterizations suggest that there are just two\nlevels, the level of the mechanism and the level of its components.\nHowever, when we take into account that a component can also be\nmechanism in itself, this picture is expanded into a multilevel\nhierarchy: The components of that nested mechanism then form a third\nlevel, which is two levels lower than the overall mechanism (Bechtel\n2008: 147). This mechanistic decomposition can be repeated as many\ntimes as necessary; there is no a priori limit to the number of levels\nin a mechanism.\n\nThe standard example of levels of mechanisms is the case of spatial\nmemory and long-term potentiation (LTP; Craver 2007: 165\u2013170).\nIn the spatial memory mechanism, four levels of mechanism can be\nidentified: the level of spatial memory, the level of spatial map\nformation, the cellular-electrophysiological level, and finally the\nmolecular level. Entities at each lower level are components in the\nhigher-level mechanism. For example, an NMDA receptor at the molecular\nlevel is a component of the LTP mechanism at the cellular level, and\nthe LTP mechanism is in turn a component of the hippocampal mechanism\nof memory consolidation (at the level of spatial map formation). The\nhippocampal mechanism of memory consolidation then contributes to the\noverall mechanism at the level of spatial memory, which is the highest\nlevel and involves, for example, behavioral tasks (e.g., navigating a\nmaze).\n\nLevels of mechanisms share some key features with the traditional idea\nof levels of organization: They are by definition compositional,\nentities at higher levels are typically larger than entities at lower\nlevels, and levels of mechanisms can potentially amount to local peaks\nof regularity and predictability (Craver 2007: 190; see next section).\nHowever, levels of mechanisms are far more limited and minimalistic\nthan any other extant approaches to levels of organization. First of\nall, as already mentioned, levels of mechanisms can only be identified\non a case-by-case basis, and different mechanisms can have entirely\ndifferent levels. For example, the set of levels in the mechanism of\nprotein folding is very different from the levels in the spatial\nmemory mechanism.\n\nMoreover, even within one mechanism, the question whether two items\nare at the same or different levels often has no well-defined answer.\nThis is due to the fact that levels are defined solely in terms of\ndirect part-whole (or component-mechanism) relationships. For example,\nNMDA receptors and synaptic vesicles are components of the cellular\nLTP mechanisms, and thus can be said to be at the same level. The\ncomponents of NMDA receptors in turn include things such as glutamate\nbinding sites and glutamate ions, whereas the components of synaptic\nvesicles include things such as transport proteins. However, as\nglutamate binding sites and transport proteins are neither components\nof one another nor direct components in the same (sub)mechanism, they\nare neither at the same level nor at different levels (Bechtel 2008:\n147). The question how they are related levels-wise has no answer in\nthe mechanistic framework. What this means is that even within a\nspecific mechanism, levels of mechanisms do not form horizontal layers\nthat span across the mechanism, but rather small islands formed by the\nworking parts of a (sub)mechanism. Another implication is that even\nidentical things (e.g., NMDA molecules) within the same overall\nmechanism are often not at the same level (Eronen 2013). Craver (2015)\nhas suggested that the whole idea of being \u201cat the same\nlevel\u201d is in fact unimportant or even meaningless in the context\nof levels of mechanisms; it is sufficient that there is a clear sense\nin which mechanisms are at a higher level relative to their components\n(and the components are at a lower level relative to the mechanism as\na whole), and this does not require that the components or mechanisms\nalso form horizontal levels.\n\nA further problem that the mechanistic account shares with the\nlayer-cake account is that it is embedded within a conceptual\nframework where \u2018levels\u2019 are defined in terms of other\ntechnical terms that are more foundational in that framework (Brooks\n2017). The layer-cake account was originally embedded in Oppenheim and\nPutnam\u2019s overarching project of arguing for the unity of\nscience, and their understanding of \u2018levels\u2019 was in part\nconceived to explicate how microreduction works. The mechanistic\naccount for its part is embedded within the New Mechanism\u2019s\nprogram of explicating mechanistic explanation and mechanisms; since\n\u201clevels of mechanisms\u201d largely overlap with technical\nterms that define what a mechanism is, it is a legitimate question\nwhat distinct notion of \u2018levels\u2019 results at all that is\nnot directly derivable from the notion of a mechanism (cf. Eronen\n2013).\n\nIn this light, it is clear that levels of mechanisms are only\ndistantly related to earlier attempts at elucidating levels in the\nlife sciences, and have many features that we intuitively would not\nassociate with the idea of levels (Eronen 2015). However, this is\ncompatible with the idea that the relationships of mechanistic\ncomposition that levels of mechanisms track are as such crucially\nimportant for understanding and explaining biological\norganization.\n\nSeveral authors have recently defended a \u201cflat\u201d view of\nthe levels in mechanisms (Bechtel 2017; Bickle, De Sousa, & Silva\n2022; Craver, Glennan & Povich 2021; Fazekas 2022). For example,\nPeter Fazekas (2022) suggests that what we call mechanistic\n\u201clevels\u201d just identify modules, or sets of interacting\nunits, within a causal network. In this view, there are no\nontologically distinct levels in mechanisms at all, mechanisms are\njust extremely complex systems of interacting parts all at one\n\u201clevel\u201d. Bechtel (2017) and Craver et al. (2021) put\nforward a similar flat interpretation of mechanistic levels, but argue\nthat this is compatible with the original non-reductive commitments of\nthe mechanistic approach (see also\n section 4).\n For further attempts at expanding or developing the notion of levels\nof mechanisms, see Bertolaso & Buzzoni (2017), Harbecke (2015) and\nKaiser (2015).\n2.3 Wimsatt\u2019s \u201clocal maxima\u201d account\n\nBoth the layer-cake and the mechanistic approach to levels aim at\ndefining levels in the sense of giving at least necessary conditions\nfor what constitutes a level. William Wimsatt (1976a; 1994) takes a\ndifferent approach and sets out to characterize the key features that\nlevels of organization typically (but not necessarily) exhibit across\ndifferent instances. Originally, an important background motivation\nfor Wimsatt was to understand and characterize claims about\n\u201chigher-level\u201d entities and phenomena that are ubiquitous\nin biology and social sciences (Wimsatt 2021). The philosophical\ndiscussions in the 1970s were focused on strong reductionism or\neliminativism (see the entry on\n Reductionism in Biology),\n which seemed inadequate to capture the way many scientists perceived\nthe organization of nature (Wimsatt 2021). Inspired by the work of\nSimon (1962 [1996]), Wimsatt set out to develop a \u201ctropical\nrainforest ontology\u201d in contrast to a Quinean \u201cdesert\nontology\u201d, and levels played a central role in this account.\nFirst, according to Wimsatt, levels are compositional and form nested\nhierarchical structures, so that wholes at lower levels function as\nparts at higher levels. Second, levels of organization are a\n\n\ndeep, non-arbitrary, and extremely important feature of the\nontological architecture of our natural world, and almost certainly of\nany world which could produce, and be inhabited or understood by,\nintelligent beings. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 203])\n\n\nA further feature of levels of organization is that they are\n\n\nconstituted by families of entities usually of comparable size and\ndynamical properties, which characteristically interact primarily with\none another. (Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 204])\n\n\nA helpful metaphor that Wimsatt uses to illustrate this is that we can\nthink of theories or models of specific levels as sieves of different\nsizes that sift out things with the appropriate size and dynamical\nproperties (Wimsatt 1976a: 237). Thus, theories at the level of\norganisms sift out roughly organism-sized things that are capable of\nreproduction and primarily interact with each other.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly,\n\n\n[l]evels of organization can be thought of as local maxima of\nregularity and predictability in the phase space of alternative modes\nof organization of matter. (1976a: 209; see also 1976a: 238)\n\n\nThis point is \u201cthe closest that [Wimsatt] will come to a\ndefinition\u201d (1976a: 209), and requires some explanation. The\nidea is roughly that patterns and regularities that can be used as a\nbasis for prediction and explanation are found clustered around\ncertain scales, and such clusters indicate levels of organization.\nThus, if we plot regularity and predictability against (size) scale,\nthen levels of organization will appear as peaks in the plot (see\nFigure). The entities that we find at these \u201clocal maxima\u201d\nwill exhibit stable regularities in virtue of the criteria (size,\nrate, dynamic properties, etc.) with which they are grouped into\nlevels, and these regularities can also serve as the basis for\nreliable predictability. Moreover, levels of organization comprise\n\u201cthe most probable states of matter\u201d (1976a:\n239), meaning that if we could vary the initial conditions, under a\nrange of conditions natural selection or other selection processes\nwould result in the same levels (Wimsatt 1976a: 238\u2013239). For\nexample, if the level of molecules is a level of organization in\nWimsatt\u2019s sense, then there should be a peak in regularity and\npredictability at the scale(s) where molecules are located, and\nmolecules should be the most probable mode of organization of matter\nunder a range of conditions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\u00a0Wimsatt's levels of\norganization. Based on Wimsatt (1976a: 240), created in 1973; used\nwith permission. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWimsatt points out many other features that levels may have: For\nexample, processes at higher levels tend to happen at slower rates\nthan processes at lower levels, higher level properties are typically\nmultiply realized by lower level properties, and higher-level causal\nrelationships are dynamically autonomous in the sense of being largely\nindependent of what happens at lower-levels. What differentiates\nlevels will also vary between instances, and may include part-whole\ndistinctions, the magnitudes of forces by which things interact, or,\npragmatically, considerations of size of different constituents.\n\nImportantly, Wimsatt also argues that in contexts where part-whole\nrelationships become too complex, such as in many biological systems,\nlevels of organization break down, and in these cases a more\nappropriate organizational notion is perspective (Wimsatt\n1994 [2007, 227]). Perspectives are (incomplete) accounts of systems\nbased on a set of variables, and in contrast to levels, need not have\nany part-whole structure. For example, we can approach organisms from\nanatomical, physiological or genetic perspectives, each perspective\ncoming with a proprietary set of variables. When even the boundaries\nof perspectives start to break down, and it is no longer clear to\nwhich perspective a problem belongs to, we are facing what Wimsatt\ncalls a causal thicket. According to Wimsatt,\n\n\nneurophysiological, psychological, and social realms are mostly\nthickets, which are only occasionally well-ordered enough for local\nproblems to be treated as perspectival or level-relative problems.\n(Wimsatt 1994 [2007: 239])\n\n\nGriesemer (2021) presents a more epistemic reading of these notions:\nWhen scientists first approach a complex system, they encounter it as\na causal thicket, but they then proceed to \u201cprune\u201d it,\nfirst to perspectives and then (possibly) to levels.\n\nBy including so many caveats and possible but not necessary\ncharacteristics of levels, Wimsatt makes his account extremely\nversatile and wide in scope, but at the same time open to charges of\nvagueness or inconsistency (cf. Craver 2007: 182\u2013183). It\ncontains a multitude of criteria that levels could but do not\nnecessarily have to satisfy, so that almost any set of entities that\nare in some respect similar to one another could be said to form a\nlevel. Moreover, the individual criteria as such also raise many\nquestions. For example, how should we understand the \u201clocal\nmaxima of regularity and predictability\u201d? What kinds of\nregularities should we include\u2014only causal generalizations, or\nalso regularities describing associational or compositional relations\n(Craver 2007: 182\u2013183)? How do we count or estimate the number\nof regularities on a given scale? How do these peaks match with the\nother proposed criteria, such as the part-whole organization of\nlevels?\n\nThese worries are to some extent alleviated by taking into account an\nimportant background idea in Wimsatt\u2019s approach: Levels of\norganization and the entities that occupy them should be\nrobust, meaning that they should be detectable, measurable,\nderivable, definable, and so on, in a variety of independent\nways (1981 [2007: 63\u20134]; 1994 [2007: 210]). In other words, they\nshould exhibit redundancy between independent means of accessing,\ndetecting or defining them, and therefore should not depend on any\nsingle criterion or defining feature. Thus, if levels of organization\nare robust, the choice of criteria, or the problems of some individual\ncriterion, will not be crucial. However, the extent to which there are\nsuch robust levels of organization in nature remains an open question.\nWhat is clear is that Wimsatt\u2019s account of levels of\norganization is still highly relevant and continues to serve as the\nbackdrop for informed discussions of levels (see, e.g., the articles\nin the collection Brooks, DiFrisco & Wimsatt 2021b; and DiFrisco\n2021 for a process-based account of levels that is explicitly\nWimsattian in character).\n2.4 Levels skepticism and deflationary accounts\n\nDespite the familiarity of scientists and philosophers with the levels\nconcept, calls for its dismissal or de-emphasis in the scientific\nlexicon are increasingly common (Eronen 2013; Guttman 1976; Ladyman\n& Ross 2007; Potochnik 2017; 2021; Potochnik & McGill 2012;\nRueger & McGivern 2010; Thalos 2013). For one thing, nature may\nsimply be too messy to fit any layer-cake style picture. Consider as\nan illustration the putative level of \u201corganisms\u201d. Blue\nwhales and yeast cells are both clearly organisms and thus should\nnominally be located at this level, but each comprises radically\ndifferent kinds of entities with radically different properties\n(Potochnik & McGill 2012). Moreover, but when we consider the next\nlower level, namely the one indicated by the components of these\norganisms, the picture of levels as neat horizontal layers breaks down\ncompletely. The components of blue whales include things such as\norgans, tissues and cells, whereas yeast cells are composed of things\nlike the cell membrane, nucleus and mitochondria (cf. Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012). Furthermore, the whale is in part composed of various\nsymbionts, including gut bacteria which are at the same time\ncomponents of the whale and organisms in themselves. Thus, the\ncomponents of different kinds of organisms do not form any homogeneous\n\u201clevel\u201d.\n\nThese problems are not just due to the difficulties of defining what\nan organism is. Similar issues arise when we consider the components\nof cells, such as the cell membrane and mitochondria, and especially\ntheir subcomponents (e.g, lipid molecules and the outer mitochondrial\nmembrane respectively): they exhibit too much heterogeneity to form\nneat levels (Eronen 2021). Moreover, the same kinds of things can be\nparts in very different higher-level wholes: For example, hydrogen\nions are components of the lipid molecules that make up cell\nmembranes, but they can also be free-standing components in the\noxidative phosphorylation mechanism that involves the cell membrane as\nanother component (Bechtel 2008: 147).\n\nMore generally, Potochnik and McGill (2012; see also Potochnik 2021)\nargue that \u2018levels\u2019 imposes a radically false, rigid\nuniformity onto nature, and identify these problems with the basic\nidea of the levels concept itself:\n\n\nIndeed, the very notion of stratified levels depends on not only the\nubiquity, but also the uniformity, of part-whole composition. For\nstrata to emerge, atoms must always compose molecules, populations\nmust always compose communities, and so forth. But the uniformity of\ncomposition needed for stratified levels simply does not\nexist. (2012: 126; emphasis added; see also Guttman 1976: 113;\nThalos 2013: 10)\n\n\nThis comprehensive, uniform rigidity in turn undermines other features\nattributed to levels of organization. One of these features is the\nsupposed epistemic merit (or fault) inherently exhibited by natural\nconstituents due to their position at a particular level (Potochnik\n& McGill 2012: 129\u201330; Potochnik 2021). For instance,\nreductionists frequently argue that molecular-level explanations are\ngenerally more secure, more fundamental, or otherwise superior to\nexplanations citing higher-level structures like chromosomes or cells\n(and conversely, anti-reductionists claim that higher-level\nconstituents are often necessary for producing adequate explanations).\nHowever, as has been pointed out by many authors, blanket attributions\nof significance like these are deeply misleading (see\n section 4).\n One reason for this is that particular levels exhibit epistemic merit\nonly in regard to what is being investigated. As such, what is taken\nto be the relevant level will shift depending on what structures or\nprocesses comprise the focus of scientists\u2019 investigative tasks,\nand hence no level will have inherent or principled epistemic\nsuperiority. Moreover, epistemic products like explanations and\ntheories in biology rarely exhibit a monolevel structure, but rather\ninclude multiple levels simultaneously (e.g., Schaffner 1993:\n97\u20138, 387; Mitchell 2003: 147; Craver 2007).\n\nThe basic conclusion that Potochnik and other levels skeptics draw\nfrom this is the following. The levels concept precludes a\nsophisticated discussion of philosophical and scientific issues by\nimposing an overly simplistic representation of science and nature.\nSo, although perhaps no one would deny the attractiveness of\n\u2018levels\u2019 in seeking to make complex natural systems\ntractable to analysis, depicting these systems using the concept seems\nto do far more harm than good. Burton S. Guttman is very clear on\nthis, arguing that \u201cif it is stated in any but the sloppiest and\nmost general terms, [the concept of levels] is a useless and even\nmisleading concept\u201d (Guttman 1976: 112). Similarly, Miriam\nThalos colorfully names \u201cthe conceit of levels\u201d before\nstating that \u201cthe notion of levels provides no useful\nphilosophical ideas whatsoever\u201d (Thalos 2013: 13).\n\nThis levels-skepticism also possesses a more constructive side.\nSeveral authors have suggested replacing or reinterpreting levels talk\nin terms of other concepts (Eronen 2015; Noble 2012; Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012; see also P.S. Churchland & Sejnowski 1992; McCauley\n2009; Rueger & McGivern 2010). The motivation behind this\n\u201cdeflationary\u201d approach (Eronen 2013) is that the problems\nassociated with levels of organization can be avoided if more\nwell-defined notions are applied instead. For instance, the notion of\nscale arguably does not lead to the same kinds of problems as\nthe notion of levels of organization. All that is needed for arranging\nthings on a scale is measuring some quantitative property of those\nthings. Scales also have the advantage of being entirely continuous,\nwhile levels require placing things at distinct and discrete positions\nin the hierarchy (Potochnik & McGill 2012). The scale that is the\nmost obviously relevant one in this context is the size scale, which\nis based on how big things are: Organisms are usually (though not\nalways) bigger than cells, which are bigger than molecules, which are\nbigger than atoms, and so on.\n\nHowever, the time scale is also crucially important for understanding\nbiological organization (Simon 1962; DiFrisco 2017). Time scale can\nrefer to the rate at which a process occurs, but also to the frequency\nof a process, or to the rate of interactions between processes or\nentities, all of which are relevant scales in the context of biology\n(Baedke 2021). For example, interactions between organisms (e.g.,\nsexual reproduction) take place at much slower rates than interactions\nbetween cells (e.g., synaptic communication), which again are slower\nthan interactions between molecules (e.g., receptor binding). The idea\nof ordering biological processes based on time scale has a long\nhistory, going back at least to organicism (see\n section 1;\n Baedke 2021). Understanding levels in terms of scales is also\nconsistent with the idea that at some scales we may find peaks of\nregularity or predictability (Wimsatt 1994 [2007]), or clusters of\ncausal relationships (Potochnik & McGill 2012). Besides scales,\nalso other notions have been proposed to replace levels, such as\nnetworks (Potochnik 2021; see also Bechtel 2017) or explanatory styles\n(Potochnik & Sanches Oliveira 2020).\n\nAlthough these skeptical and deflationary approaches, where the notion\nof levels is reduced or deflated to more well-defined concepts,\nostensibly increase conceptual clarity, they may not be sufficient for\naccounting for the role of levels of organization in biological theory\nand practice (see also\n section 6).\n For example, the cellular level is a canonical level organization,\nbut cells come in many different sizes, and it is hard to identify a\nsize (or time) scale that would play a similar role as the notion of a\ncellular level. Moreover, skepticism regarding specific philosophical\nconceptions of levels, such as layer-cake-style levels or levels of\nmechanisms, leaves open the possibility that more piecemeal or\ncontext-specific approaches to levels may still be useful.\n3. Levels as a fragmentary and heuristic notion\n\nIn the wake of skeptical arguments against the levels concept, recent\nwork on the notion has sought to address the pessimistic appraisals\noutlined in the previous section by rejuvenating the discussion\nsurrounding levels. One key component in reestablishing the potential\nof levels for philosophical insight has been to address the gap\nbetween philosophical expectations placed upon the concept in\nskeptical treatments, and the usage dynamics informing scientific\napplications of the concept (Brooks 2021b; see also DiFrisco 2017 and\nBrooks, DiFrisco & Wimsatt 2021a).\n\nIn particular, philosophical expectations placed upon accounts of\nlevels tend to depart from scientific applications of the concept both\nin characterizing how the levels concept is used and in the\nmotivations behind applying the concept in scientific contexts. This\nis especially visible in the way that levels are conceptualized by\ncritics. For instance, Potochnik characterizes the objectionable\nconsequences of the levels concept as stemming from \u201cthe very\nidea\u201d of levels (2017: 170), where this \u201cvery idea\u201d\ntakes the concept to impose (i) universality of composition, (ii)\nuniform relations between putative levels, and (iii) total\ndiscreteness of level-bound units (2017: 170; see also Potochnik &\nMcGill 2012: 126). Similarly, Thalos claims that to even postulate a\nleveled ontology is to be committed to a reductionist \u201cmaster\nontology\u201d grounded in physics from which all other higher levels\nderive (2013: 7).\n\nBoth of these characterizations rest on attributions to the levels\nconcept stemming from philosophical sources rather than scientific\nusage of the concept. For one thing, Potochnik\u2019s idea of levels\nseems to presume a layer-cake conception, an account that has few\ncontemporary advocates and whose fidelity to science has arguably\nalways at least been questionable. Likewise, the commitment to a\nreductionist ontology purported by Thalos rests decidedly on the\nfurther postulation of reductionist physicalism, a stance to which the\nlevels concept is at best neutral (see\n section 6).\n Though these sources for making levels intelligible as an object of\ncriticism may enjoy intuitive appeal widely in play in general\nphilosophy of science and philosophy of mind, it is plausible that\nassessing the merits (and demerits) of the concept requires extraction\nfrom base intuition and exposure to further scientific-philosophical\nscrutiny (Brooks, DiFrisco, & Wimsatt 2021a).\n\nFor these reasons, efforts to rejuvenate levels and their significance\nhave turned to different sources to enable scientific input into the\nconceptualization of levels. One important consequence of this has\nbeen the rejection of any neat and tidy definition or unitary account\nof levels, instead treating the concept within multiple facets of\nreconstruction that scientific usage engenders. That is, engaging with\nthe notion is seen as a widely open-ended endeavor (Brooks 2021a).\n\nOne such front of approaches to levels focuses on the roles of the\nconcept in scientific reasoning. For instance, Brooks and Eronen\n(2018) locate a heuristic element within usage of levels of\norganization. In this approach, instead of focusing primarily on what\nlevels are ontologically speaking, or attempting to give a unitary\ndefinition of levels, the focus is to recover first the significance\nattributed to levels when applied in science (and parts of philosophy\nof biology). In particular, depicting biological systems requires\nemphasizing some details over others, as incorporating all details of\nan investigated system is not possible due to the cognitive and\nphysical constraints placed on human agents (in line with the focus on\nheuristic reasoning). Thus, scientific uses of levels involve\ndescriptive abstractions figuring into the decisions researchers make\nin selecting features of a system intended for the attending analysis.\nA second use Brooks and Eronen identify concerns the postulation of\nlevels as guiding scientific inquiry in that different putative\nlevels, though perhaps not well-characterized at the outset, serve as\npoints of departure for new fields of inquiry in laying out landscapes\nof problems and questions that lie in front of these fields (such as\nsystems biology in the 2000s). Eronen (2021) identifies a further\nheuristic in the basic idea that in levels of organization\n\u201csimilar things are composed of things that are similar to one\nanother\u201d, which may often work as an abstraction. For example,\nboth proteins and genes (at a higher level), which are similar in\nimportant ways, are composed of monomers such amino acids and\nnucleotides (at a lower level), which are again similar to one another\nin important ways.\n\nThis being said, the heuristic approach offers an incomplete account\nof levels, an intentional feature meant to invite further work on the\nnotion. The heuristic approach thus seeks to capture some minimal\nfeatures that a more committed body of work should account for. A core\nmotivation of this approach is to construct a rapprochement between\nadvocates of the levels concept and more skeptical theorists (see,\nhowever, Potochnik 2021 for criticism of the heuristic approach).\nParticularly, supporters of the heuristic approach argue that a more\nnuanced appraisal of the levels concept aids to reveal its flexibility\nand usefulness in science. Most especially, it emphasizes that, like\nother heuristics, the concept may work in some contexts but not in\nothers. Such scattered records of success, failure, and neutral\naccomplishments are in turn \u201cmundane to scientific concepts in\ngeneral\u201d (Brooks & Eronen 2018: 41).\n\nUsing the heuristic appraisal of levels as a springboard, a more\nsystematic reconstruction of the levels concept in scientific\nreasoning points to a \u201cfragmentary approach\u201d whereby more\noverarching usage profiles begin to take shape. Brooks (2021a) for\ninstance articulates two such profiles associated with the levels\nconcept in scientific usage. One of these profiles identifies the\nlevels concept as a tool (sensu Griffiths & Stotz 2008;\nFeest 2010) that scientists use to, for example, construct material\ninferences in specific experimental systems and to aid in providing\nprojectibility to these inferences by conferring generality to the\nstructures and processes involved. This profile of usage\narguably\u00a0captures practical scientific work operative in research\narticles published for specialist researchers. A second usage profile\nassociated with levels appears as a kind of \u201cdoctrinal\u201d\nnotion in the vein of cell theory or the germ theory of disease. This\nprofile draws its inspiration from the notion of doctrine, in the\nsense of something that is widely taught or adhered to, and is visible\nin scientific textbooks (see\n section 6.7)\n and in broad statements of position by grant-funding agencies and\nmajor theoretical works in biology. That is, the notion of levels of\norganization comprises a core theoretical component in the edifice of\nbiology in serving to introduce or advocate for a basic view of\nbiological science. Both of these usage profiles, seen as tool and\ndoctrine, complement each other in conferring (i) fine-grained content\nto the concept in specific instances (tool) and (ii) general warrant\nto the notion as an established confluence of insights acquired\nthroughout history (doctrine). Moreover, both suggest a unifying\nrationale to the notion, identified in its potential ability to\nstructure scientific problems (Brooks 2021b).\n4. Reductionism, pluralism, and levels\n\nAs we saw above, Oppenheim and Putnam introduced their highly\ninfluential view of levels in the context of the reductive unity of\nscience, and Wimsatt\u2019s account was partly motivated by the need\nto respond to reductionism. Up to this day, levels have continued to\nplay an important role in debates on reductionism (see the entry\n Reductionism in Biology).\n Questions of reductionism are often explicitly formulated in terms of\nlevels: Do higher level properties, theories, or explanations reduce\nto lower level ones?\n\nIn the classical Nagelian account (Nagel 1961), reduction amounts to\nderiving a theory that is to be reduced from a more fundamental theory\non the basis of two conditions: deducibility and connectability (see\nthe entry\n Scientific Reduction).\n The standard example is the reduction of thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics. Nagel thought that from the laws of statistical\nmechanics one an derive the laws of thermodynamics (deducibility),\nwith the help of \u201cbridge principles\u201d that connect the\nterms of these two theories (connectability; Nagel 1961: ch. 11;\nSchaffner 1967).\n\nNagel\u2019s original approach to reduction has been criticized from\nmany angles, but in the present context, the most relevant criticism\nis that the classical model ignores the distinction between\ninterlevel and intralevel reductions in science\n(Wimsatt 1976a; 1976b; McCauley 1996). Intralevel (or successional)\nsettings involve competing theories within a particular science and\nwithin a particular level, for example the phlogiston theory and the\ncaloric theory of heat. Interlevel settings, on the other hand,\ninvolve theories at different levels of organization that thereby have\ndiffering explananda, terminology and methodology: for example,\ncognitive psychology and molecular neuroscience. Nagel\u2019s model\nin its classic form treats these different contexts equally. For this\nand many other reasons (see, e.g., Walter & Eronen 2011), it is\nwidely agreed that the Nagelian model fails to reconstruct reductive\nrelations as they appear in actual science (Wimsatt 1976b; 1979), and\nthat the model in its original form is inapplicable to actual\nbiological cases (Kaiser 2012).\n\nProblems of the Nagelian model led to the development of alternative\naccounts based on the same basic idea, which actively incorporated the\nidea of levels into their framework (Hooker 1981; P.S. Churchland\n1986; Schaffner 1993; Bickle 1998; 2003). This culminated in the\n\u201cNew Wave\u201d model of reduction, where intertheoretic\nrelations form a continuum ranging from complete elimination to\nretentive Nagel-style reduction (Bickle 1998). For a summary of this\nmodel, see the entry\n Scientific Reduction\n \u00a72.6.\n\nOther accounts of reduction also countenance the levels concept,\nalbeit in different ways. In his \u201cruthless\u201d account of\nreductionism, Bickle (2003) abandons the idea of reduction progressing\nstepwise from level to level, and argues that cellular and molecular\nneuroscience can directly replace psychology (see also Barwich 2021).\nIf one can intervene onto the molecular level to change variables at\nthe behavioral level, then, Bickle contends, one has discovered the\n\u201cgenuine\u201d causal mechanism for those variables (Bickle\n2003). Here \u2018levels\u2019 figure into ruthless reductionism as\nuseful fictions, where intermediary levels such as tissues, organs,\nand the like provide a scaffolding for emerging molecular-level\nexplanations. These intermediary levels exhibit \u201cmerely\u201d\nheuristic value, only in the service of constructing\nbehavior-to-molecules reductions (Bickle 2003: 130). Recently, Bickle\nhas defended an even stronger and explicitly \u201clevels-less\u201d\nversion of reductionism, where levels no longer have even a heuristic\nrole (Bickle et al., 2022).\n\nA different reconceptualization of reduction is offered by\nH\u00fcttemann and Love (2011), who note that part-whole reduction in\nparticular has become a widely-endorsed alternative to the Nagelian\nframework (see also Brigandt 2013: 77). They put forward\ncompositionality and causality as two aspects of\nreductive explanation (H\u00fcttemann & Love 2011: 4), which are\nboth expressed in levels-laden language. Compositionality, for\ninstance, is couched in \u2018levels\u2019 in that the very notions\nof part and whole in biological contexts correspond to respectively\nlower- and higher-level status (cf. Kaiser 2015, 192; Winther 2006).\nKaiser (2015) goes further than this approach in claiming that a\n\u201clower-level character\u201d is a necessary condition for an\nexplanation to even be considered reductive (2015: 188).\n\nThe idea of levels has also figured prominently into arguments for\nantireductionism and pluralism. In his classic treatise, Philip\nKitcher (1984) elevates the level concept to a centerpiece of the\nantireductionist position. According to Kitcher, the reductionist\naspiration of reducing classical Mendelian to molecular genetics will\nnot pan out because molecular constituents do not capture the causal\nrelations between Mendelian constituents (e.g., chromosomes) and\nheritable traits. Importantly, Kitcher grounds this in the structure\nof the world as captured by the levels concept:\n\n\nAnti-reductionism construes the current division of biology not simply\nas a temporary feature of our science stemming from our cognitive\nimperfections but as the reflection of levels of organization in\nnature. (1984: 371, emphasis modified; Rosenberg [1985: 119]\nmakes a similar statement)\n\n\nElevating the levels concept even further, Kitcher makes levels (of\nthe layer-cake variety) part of the conception of antireductionism\nitself, concluding that\n\n\nto the extent that we can make sense of the present explanatory\nstructure within biology\u2014that division of the field into\nsubfields corresponding to levels of organization in nature\u2014we\ncan also understand the antireductionist doctrine. (Kitcher 1984:\n373)\n\n\nIn a more recent defense of antireductionism, Robert McCauley (1996;\n2007) expands on the intra-interlevel distinction to plead for a\nmultilevel explanatory pluralism between higher- and lower-level\ntheories. McCauley targets the New Wave model where intertheory\nrelations result in a spectrum of consequences, ranging from identity\nto elimination, for higher-level theories (P.M. Churchland 1979; P.M.\nChurchland and P.S. Churchland 1990; Bickle 1998). He argues that a\nsingle spectrum of reductive consequences misrepresents the nature of\nintertheory coevolution. Intralevel reductions, focusing on reduction\nin terms of replacement, do not capture the historical dynamics\ninvolved in evaluating interlevel cases, and elimination is virtually\nnonexistent in interlevel cases. Moreover, eliminating or reducing\nhigher-level theories would also undermine the status of the\nhigher-level\u2019s scientific institutions (McCauley 1996). As this\nrarely happens, and attributing epistemic, ontological, or\nmethodological superiority to the lower levels is at best a claim that\nneeds to be substantiated, the New Wave model appears to be wildly at\nodds with actual scientific practice. According to McCauley, we\nobserve intertheoretical coevolution instead, where higher-level\ntheories can offer lower-level theories criteria for external\ncoherency, evidential constraints, and novel problem solving\nstrategies (McCauley 1996).\n\nOther arguments for pluralism also take their start from levels of\norganization. Sandra Mitchell (2003), for instance, argues for\nintegrative pluralism that is suggested by the multilevel and\nmulticomponential \u201contology of complex systems\u201d (2009:\n109). The basic idea of integrative pluralism falls out of the fact\nthat biological systems evolve in a contingent manner, thus setting\nthe stage for multilevel evolutionary scenarios (Mitchell 2003). This\nin turn highlights the preponderance of \u2018emergent\nproperties\u2019 in biological systems, which appear at novel levels\nof organization out of the interactions of simpler components. Both of\nthese factors inflate the overall number of explanatory sources that\ncould contribute to explaining a given phenomenon (2003; 2009).\nConsequently, discovering unilateral causes for complex phenomena will\nnot be forthcoming (2003, 160). Likewise, Ingo Brigandt (2010; 2013)\nemphasizes the pursuance of investigation at multiple levels of\norganization as a fact about scientific practice, but also as cause to\narticulate the localized significance of explanatory contributions to\nparticular problems, as in the case of evo-devo explanations.\n\nThis kind of multilevel pluralism is also defended by the supporters\nof the New Mechanism (Bechtel 2008; Craver 2005, 2007; Brigandt 2010:\n297; see also\n Mechanisms in Science).\n As McCauley (2007) points out, mechanistic explanation can be seen as\nexplanatory pluralism \u201cwrit small\u201d: In each localized\nmechanistic context, several levels (understood as levels of\nmechanisms) are needed to fully explain the phenomenon. However,\nauthors such as Fazekas (2022), Fazekas and Kert\u00e9sz (2011), and\nSoom (2012) argue that the commitments of New Mechanism are in fact\nincompatible with robust antireductionism.\n5. Levels and downward causation\n\nLevels of organization have traditionally provided the framework for\nthe debate on downward causation, where the question is whether\nhigher-level entities or properties can exert causal influence on\nlower-level ones (e.g., Bechtel 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997; 2000; Kim 1992; 1999; Craver & Bechtel 2007). The idea of\ndownward causation is closely connected to emergentism, and is often\nseen as one of its core tenets (Emmeche et al. 1997; 2000; Kim 1999;\nsee also the entry\n Emergent Properties).\n Examples of putative downward causation include psychological states\ncausing physical behavior, the activity of an organism causing changes\nin the tissues and cells of that organism, and cell-level processes\nsuch as synaptic communication causing molecular changes. On the one\nhand, downward causation seems prima facie to be common or\neven ubiquitous in experiments and explanations in the life sciences,\nand many scientists and philosophers consider it to be an important\nfeature of nature (Campbell 1974; Ellis 2008; Love 2012; Noble 2012).\nOn the other hand, in philosophy downward causation has often been\napproached with skepticism (e.g., McLaughlin 1992; Kim 1992; 1999;\n2005; Craver & Bechtel 2007).\n\nAlthough the discussion on downward causation relies heavily on the\nnotion of levels, this notion itself has not received much explicit\nattention in this context. However, to what extent downward causation\nis possible or plausible crucially depends on what notion of levels is\nassumed (Eronen 2021). Most of the critics of downward causation have\nin mind causation across compositional levels, where a whole\nexerts causal influence on its own parts. This is also what is at\nstake in the influential discussion of Craver and Bechtel, who apply\nthe framework of levels of mechanisms to analyze top-down causation\n(Bechtel 2008; Craver & Bechtel 2007; Craver 2015).\n\nCraver and Bechtel argue that genuine top-down or downward causation\ndoes not exist; there are just normal same-level causal relationships\nthat sometimes have \u201cmechanistically mediated\u201d effects\ndownward in the mechanism. What is meant by \u201cmechanistically\nmediated\u201d is that changes in the higher levels of the mechanism\nimmediately result in changes in the lower levels of the mechanisms\ndue to the constitutive relationship between the higher-level\nmechanism and its lower-level components. Mechanistically mediated\neffects may have the initial appearance of downward causation, but the\nrelationship between the mechanism and its components is constitutive,\nnot causal, and therefore mechanistically mediated effects are not\ncausal.\n\nTo clarify this, consider the example of Hal\u2019s glucose\nmetabolism (Craver & Bechtel 2007: 559\u2013560). Hal is playing\ntennis, and as he keeps running around and swinging the racket, the\ncells in Hal\u2019s body start taking in and using more glucose. It\nseems that the cause of the increase in Hal\u2019s glucose metabolism\nat the cellular level is Hal playing tennis, which suggests causation\nfrom a higher level (the level of the whole organism playing tennis)\nto a lower level (the cellular level). However, according to Craver\nand Bechtel, this would violate one central assumption regarding\ncausation, namely that causes must be distinct from their effects, and\nmust occur prior to the effects. Instead, they see this as just\nregular same-level causal relationships at the cellular level: Nerve\nsignals to the muscle cells cause a cascade of events that results in\nincreased glucose metabolism. Hal\u2019s tennis playing activity is\npartly constituted by these cellular mechanisms, and this\nconstitutive relationship is responsible for the appearance of\ndownward causation. As Hal starts to play, there are changes in these\nmechanisms, but only in virtue of them partly making up the tennis\nplaying activity.\n\nThis approach is appealing, but faces several challenges. First, it\nhas been argued that there are no clear methods of distinguishing\nbetween causal and constitutive relationships in mechanisms (e.g.,\nLeuridan 2011); if this is correct, there seems to be no reason to\nposit that \u201cmechanistically mediated\u201d effects are\nnon-causal. Second, the idea of \u201cnormal\u201d intralevel\ncausation is problematic in the framework of levels of mechanisms. As\nwe have seen in\n section 2.2,\n the idea of \u201cbeing at the same level\u201d has little if any\nsignificance in this framework, so same-level causation cannot be the\ndefault or normal type of causation. The idea seems to be rather that\nthere is no causation from a mechanism as a whole to the components of\nthat same mechanism, but this is just one very specific form of\ndownward causation, and how other forms should be treated is left open\nin this account (Eronen 2013). Third, it is not clear whether\nhigher-level causal processes in mechanisms can be distinct from\ncausal processes at lower levels of the mechanism\u2014if not, there\nare no higher-level causal processes that could have mechanistically\nmediated effects downwards in the mechanism to begin with (Fazekas\n& Kert\u00e9sz 2011; see also Fazekas 2022; Craver et al.\n2021).\n\nAlthough levels of mechanisms have been prominent in recent\nphilosophical discussions, a far more common way of approaching\ndownward causation in the biological literature has been to explicate\nit in terms of higher-level constraints or boundary\nconditions. The idea is that the behavior of lower-level things is\nconstrained by the higher-level whole that they are a part of, and\ntherefore explaining the behavior of these lower-level things is not\npossible exclusively at the lower level, but requires appealing to\nhigher-level factors (e.g., Bishop 2008; Campbell 1974; Ellis 2008;\nEmmeche et al. 1997; 2000; Green 2018; 2021; Kistler 2009; Noble 2012;\nPattee 1973; Sperry 1969). In a classic article, Donald Campbell\nexpressed this idea as follows: \u201cprocesses at the lower levels\nof a hierarchy are restrained by and act in conformity to the laws of\nthe higher level\u201d (Campbell 1974: 180). For example, according\nto Noble (2012), the higher-level cellular property of membrane\npotential constrains the activity of ion channels at a lower level,\nand this amounts to downward causation. Similarly, Green (2018; 2021)\nargues that properties of tissue structure (e.g., resistance) set\nboundary conditions for the propagation of action potentials,\nresulting in a form of downward causation.\n\nThese cases do not seem to involve causation across compositional\nlevels, that is, causation from a whole to its own parts: for\ninstance, the membrane potential and the ion channels do not stand in\na part-whole relationship (Woodward 2021). Instead, the underlying\nnotion of levels seems more akin to scales (as is also explicitly\nstated by Noble 2012 and Green 2021). More generally, Woodward (2021)\nhas argued that (downward) causation should not be seen as involving\nthings (such as wholes and their parts) as relata, but rather\nvariables, such as a variable representing the membrane potential, and\na variable representing whether an ion channel is open or closed. When\ndownward causation and levels are understood in this way, the worry\nthat the causes are not sufficiently distinct from their effects in\ndownward causation seems to dissolve, as the higher-level variables\n(e.g., membrane potential at a higher scale) are clearly distinct from\nthe lower-level effect variables (e.g., the ion channels at a lower\nscale; see Woodward 2021 for more). One unsettled question is\nwhether all putative cases of downward causation involve\ncausation in a substantial sense, or whether it would be more\nappropriate to designate, for example, constraints or boundary\nconditions as some form of downward determination or explanation (see,\ne.g., Hulswit 2005). Another remaining problem is how to reconcile\ndownward causation with the much-debated causal exclusion\nargument (e.g., Kim 1992; 1999; 2005). To put it very roughly,\nthe core of this argument is that if we accept the plausible\nassumption that all physical occurrences must have sufficient physical\ncauses, it is not clear how there could be room for additional\nhigher-level causes of lower-level physical effects. Some philosophers\nhave argued that this problem arises even for the relatively weak and\nminimalist interventionist theory of causation that is often assumed\nin debates on downward causation (Baumgartner 2013; Gebharter 2017),\nwhereas others have defended the coherence of downward causation\n(Eronen & Brooks 2014; Raatikainen 2010; Woodward 2015; 2021).\n\n6. Levels in biological theory and usage\n\nBesides the more philosophical debates discussed above, levels of\norganization also play an important conceptual role in biological\nresearch and theory. Interestingly, this growing body of literature on\nlevels in biology has (until recently) been almost entirely\ndisconnected from the debates on levels in philosophy of science\ndiscussed above.\n6.1 Levels and units of selection\n\nIn the debate on levels of selection (Lewontin 1970; Brandon 1982),\nthe hierarchical organization of nature into levels is an important\nbackground assumption, as the aim is to find out at which level(s) of\nthe biological hierarchy natural selection is taking place (Griesemer\n2001; Okasha 2006). Although Darwin\u2019s original account was\nfocused on evolution at the level of organisms, the conditions for\nnatural selection can be formulated abstractly without referring to\nany specific kinds of entities, which allows for natural selection to\noperate at any level where the conditions are satisfied (Griesemer\n2001; Lewontin 1970). Since the 1970s, the debate on levels of\nselection has kept on growing and extending to different areas, though\nno precise consensus has been reached. Positions range from the\ngene-centered view, where natural selection is taken to operate almost\nexclusively at the level of genes (e.g., Dawkins 1976; Williams 1966),\nto the pluralistic multilevel selection theory, which allows for\nnatural selection to operate on any level of the biological hierarchy\nwhere we find the right kind of units (e.g., Sober & Wilson 1998;\nWilson & Wilson 2008). For more on the levels of selection debate,\nsee Okasha (2006) and the entry\n Units and Levels of Selection.\n\nIn this debate, the notion of levels of organization is typically used\nas a background notion, the exact meaning of which is left implicit,\nor illustrated with just a list of standard levels (Eronen &\nRamsey forthcoming; Griesemer 2005). A notable exception is Okasha\n(2006), who puts forward a proposal for understanding levels of\norganization in natural selection. Okasha considers the hierarchical\norganization of nature to be one of the key factors that give rise to\nthe levels-of-selection problem, and takes as a starting point the\ntraditional picture where cells are nested within organs and tissues,\nwhich in turn are nested within organisms, and at yet higher levels we\nfind groups, colonies, and so on (Okasha 2006: 10). However, Okasha\nobserves that this standard picture is inadequate, as it is not clear\nwhich levels should be included in the context of levels of selection.\nTherefore, following McShea (2001) and Sober and Wilson (1998), Okasha\nargues that the entities at a level should interact in a way that\naffects their individual fitness (usually defined in terms of the\nnumber of offspring an individual produces). In other words,\nfitness-affecting interactions among parts is taken as a\ndefining feature that distinguishes genuine levels from arbitrary or\nnonrelevant sets of parts. In addition, according to Okasha we need to\nrule out entities such as tissues and organs from genuine levels (of\nselection). To this end, he proposes (referring to McShea 2001) that\nentities at a level should be homologous with organisms in a\nfree-living state, either extant or extinct. For example, the cells\nthat compose organisms interact with each other and are homologous to\nfree-living unicellular organisms, and therefore constitute a level in\nthis account.\n\nThis proposal has been criticized for being too restrictive: (Eronen\n& Ramsey forthcoming): Most importantly, if we include the\nhomology requirement, it is not clear how things like genes or groups\nof organisms could be seen as levels of selection, as they do not seem\nto be homologous with extant or extinct organisms. As an alternative,\nEronen and Ramsey propose to characterize levels of selection directly\nin terms of fitness-affecting interactions (or some notion that plays\na similar role, such as evolutionary individuality): A level is formed\nby any entities that are sufficiently similar and engage in\nfitness-affecting interactions. This results in a very deflationary,\ncase-specific and localized conception of levels of selection, and\nconceptually detaches levels of selection from the broader idea of\nlevels of organization. In general, the relationship between levels of\nselection and levels of organization remains a topic that requires\nfurther philosophical attention (see also\n section 6.5).\n6.2 The Hierarchy Theory of Evolution\n\nA different approach to the interplay of levels and evolution is\nprovided by the \u201chierarchy theory of evolution\u201d developed\nby Niles Eldredge and colleagues (Eldredge 1985; Eldredge &\nSalthe, 1984; Eldredge et al. 2016; Salthe 1985; Vrba & Eldredge\n1984; see also Eldredge et al. 2016). In this theoretical framework,\nlevels and hierarchies are taken synonymously to be fundamentally\nimportant ontological features of nature:\n\n\nBiological evolutionary theory is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of nested hierarchies in nature and attempts to explain\nnatural phenomena as a product of complex dynamics of real\nhierarchical systems. (T\u00ebmkin & Eldredge 2015: 184)\n\n\nIn the hierarchy theory of evolution, a distinction is made between\ntwo types of hierarchies and the corresponding levels (Eldredge 1996;\nVrba & Eldredge 1984): The ecological and the\ngenealogical hierarchy. In both kinds of hierarchies,\nhigher-level things are formed through specific interactions among\nlower-level things. In the ecological hierarchy, these interactions\nare exchanges of matter and energy, such as consuming and gathering\nresources, and in this hierarchy, we find things such as cells,\norganisms, and ecosystems. In the genealogical hierarchy, the defining\nactivity through which levels are formed is the transmission of\ninformation through replication, and the hierarchy includes things\nsuch as cells, organisms, demes and species. (Note that cells and\norganisms appear in both hierarchies, but in the ecological hierarchy\nthey are seen as interactors, whereas in the genealogical hierarchy\nthey are seen as replicators.) Work on this hierarchy theory of\nevolution is ongoing (see, e.g., Eldredge et al. 2016; T\u00ebmkin\n2021).\n6.3 Evolutionary transitions\n\nThe issue of evolutionary transitions is closely connected to the\ndebates on levels of selection and levels of organization. Here the\nfocus is on the emergence of new levels of organization\nthrough evolutionary processes (Buss 1987: ch. 5; Griesemer 2001;\nMaynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry 1995; Okasha 2006). The background\nidea is that the complex hierarchical organization of nature that we\nobserve today must itself be a result of evolution, and therefore\nrequires an evolutionary explanation. For example, somehow prokaryotes\nevolved to eukaryotic cells, single-celled organisms evolved to\nmulticellular organisms, individual animals evolved to colonies, and\nso on (see also\n section 6.5).\n In their highly influential book, Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry\n(1995) proposed that the characteristic feature of major evolutionary\ntransitions is that entities that were capable of replicating\nindependently before the transitions are only capable of replicating\nas parts of higher-level wholes after the transitions (see also Buss\n1987). For example, after a single-celled organism has evolved into a\nmulticellular organism, the cells of the organism can no longer\nreplicate independently of the organism as a whole.\n\nDetailed models of these processes of evolutionary transitions have\nbeen developed, such as the evolutionary transitions of individuality\n(ETI) account of Michod (1999; 2005). The basic idea of this model is\nthat evolutionary transitions involve a decline in the fitness of\nindividuals (e.g., cells as they engage in cooperative behavior) and a\ncorresponding increase in the fitness of the collectives that they\nform (e.g., multicellular organisms). This eventually results in\nfitness being completely transferred to the collectives, which thereby\nform a new level of organization (see also Bourrat 2015 for criticism\nand discussion).\n6.4 The evolution of complexity\n\nLevels of organization are also invariably tied to discussions of\ncomplexity in biology. One of the most prominent appearances of levels\nin the investigation of complexity occurs in observations of the\napparent increase in structural hierarchies in organisms over\nevolutionary time. This increase of \u201cnestedness\u201d, where\nparts become located within other systems, appears to be a clear trend\nin the history of life (McShea 1996; 2001). Daniel McShea (2001)\npoints to three examples of this trend, including the origin of\neukaryotic cells from prokaryotes via endosymbiosis, the emergence of\nmulticellular organisms, and the appearance of colonies formed by\nmulticellular individuals. Yet it is not clear what precise\nrelationship exists between levels of organization and complexity, and\nthe explication of complexity remains an important task in its own\nright. On this point, though there exists no consensus among\nbiologists, the two clearly inform each other.\n\nBeginning with complexity, several measures for complexity have been\nproposed, many of which are intimately tied with the idea of levels.\nFor instance, John Tyler Bonner (1988: 220) draws attention to the\nrelations of size and complexity, identifying a trend in the upper\nlimit of body size and an increase in complexity. This overall trend\naccompanies both actual increases as well as decreases in body sizes\nover evolutionary time. Bonner entertains two measures of complexity,\nincluding (1) the correlation of body size and number of cell types,\nand (2) the relation between genome size and number of cell types.\nAlthough he (and later researchers) concluded that there is no clear\npattern indicating that the increase in the number of genes in a\ngenome is accompanied by an increase in cell types, the former\ncorrelation appears to recover robust inference patterns, and has\nbecome a mainstay of informing uses of complexity (Valentine, Collins,\n& Meyer 1994; Valentine 2002; McShea 2021). Another proposed\nmeasure of complexity, offered by Hinegardner, and Engleberg (1983),\ncharacterizes the notion in terms of the minimal description necessary\nto capture the system\u2019s behavior. These two approaches are\nrelated (Valentine, Collins, & Meyer 1994), though have not been\nsystematically integrated. Finally, McShea (2021) summarizes and\ncontrasts \u201chorizontal\u201d complexity, understood\napproximately as the number of cell types, and \u201cvertical\u201d\ncomplexity, which refers to the number of hierarchical partitionings\n(understood as nestedness) that are found within a system.\n\nThese characterizations of complexity and their relations to levels,\nlike many discussions concerning the latter, leave much room for\ncontinued discussion and further scholarship. For one thing, though it\nappears clear that complexity and levels remain intimately related,\nthe authors summarized above are not without discrepancies regarding\nthe importance, or even place, of levels of organization in talking\nabout complexity. For example, Bonner (1988) sets out his\ninvestigation by noting that it is not levels per se that is\nof interest but rather how levels themselves come into existence.\nRelatedly, McShea (2001) notes that levels of organization are a\n\u201csecondary theme\u201d (ibid., 406) to notions of nested\nhierarchies in biology and measuring complexity.\n6.5 Levels and experimental biological research\n\nAlthough the levels concept may at first glance appear an abstract\nidea poised orthogonally to empirical matters (or interpretations\nthereof), the constituents of nature that the concept orders also\ncomprise targets of experimental investigation. In this way, the\nlevels concept can be conceptualized not only as local maxima of\nregularity and predictability, but also as local maxima of\nobservability and manipulability. Here we describe several\nexperimental practices where levels play an important role, focusing\non observation and manipulation.\n\nTracking the various objects and processes occurring at different\nscales of nature is a centerpiece to conducting observations and\nobservational studies in biology. That these constituents then also\nfrequently make up central units of study for biology (molecules,\ncells, tissues, organs, and so on) is one notable element of the\nlevels concept\u2019s basic expression (Wimsatt 1994; 2021). The\nsystematicity of these constituents\u2019 relationships is an\nespecially noteworthy consequence of reasoning with the levels\nconcept: When we shift between scale resolutions (be it temporal or\nspatial), different units of study can be identified and investigated.\nOftentimes, the units generically involved in an area of research\n(molecules, cells, tissues) are basically known, but their specific\ndynamics comprise targets for further study and characterization\n(Brooks 2021b).\n\nIn addition to observational techniques, experimental manipulation of\ndifferent scale-bound units is another hallmark of daily practices in\nbiological research. Here the levels concept contributes to our basic\nreasoning of these practices by aiding our efforts in testing\nhypotheses and building explanations. In this vein, Alan Love (2021)\nargues that applying the levels concept is not merely a matter of\nabstract representation, but also of articulating well-defined\nexperimental targets in laboratory settings. Love considers examples\nsuch as mixed cell aggregates, a well-established and classical\nexperimental technique where tissues are first physically separated\ninto their constituent cells, mixed together in a medium, and then\nsegregate and regrow into tissue aggregates of similar cell-type (see\nespecially Moscona 1959). Such targets of manipulation, Love reasons,\nalign with the explicit aims of researching biologists to describe,\npredict, and explain biological phenomena such as morphogenesis (and\nbiological development in general; see Love 2021: 139).\n\nAs the example of mixed cell aggregates implies, observation and\nmanipulation co-occur in experimental settings: Tissues (higher level)\nare physically separated into individual cells (lower level) and\nplaced in a medium (that is, are manipulated), and their subsequent\nbehavior is observed and measured. Such transitions to and from higher\nand lower levels demonstrate the structuring capacities of the levels\nconcept for interpreting the significance of experimental efforts.\nConsider another example from experimental evolution (for a primer\nsee, e.g., Kawecki et al. 2012), where the transition from cellular to\nmulticellular individuals is experimentally induced in different\nspecies of unicellular life. In one experiment, Ratcliff, Denison, et\nal. (2012) induced multicellular snowflake-like clusters in the yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae using a simple selection regime\n(i.e., gravity; multicellular clusters sink more quickly in a medium,\nand were collected after various intervals and placed in a new\nmedium). These clusters began reproducing via post-division adhesion\n(rather than aggregation) across several generations, thus creating\nits own novel life history (reproducing uniclonal clusters rather than\naggregates containing individual cell genomes), developing a division\nof labor among cell constituents (see also Simpson 2012), and even\nexhibiting regulation of cluster phenotype behavior, seen in the\nemergence of programmed cell death in individual cells unable to\ncontribute to the supracellular individual (see also Ratcliff,\nFankhauser, et al. 2015; Herron et al. 2019).\n\nFocusing on the practical and experimental significance of levels of\norganization also stands to contribute to the philosophical discourse\non levels more generally. Love (2021), for instance, argues that the\npractices of working biologists in manipulating levels warrant an\ninference from successful practice to scientific metaphysics, thereby\nsupporting a \u201cmodest realism\u201d regarding levels of\norganization.\n6.6 Levels and theory building in biology\n\nThe insights and hypotheses based on leveled thinking, in combination\nwith manipulations and observations performed in the lab, provide one\ninstance of synthesis between conceptual and practical matters of\ninvestigation. This synthesis often results in conceptually guided and\nempirically driven theory. Explicitly attending to different levels\nand the distinct scale-relative dynamics supports hypothesis and\ntheory building by making intelligible the scale-bound practices of\nobservation and motivating manipulation of well-defined targets in\nmanifestly complex systems.\n\nInstances of such synthesis are widely available in contemporary and\ntwentieth century biological science. For example, conceptualizing\ncancer as primarily a tissue-level disease (albeit with multiple\nlevels playing roles) has long been closely connected to interpreting\nand reinterpreting laboratory findings based on a leveled conceptual\nlandscape. Already in the 1930s, organicist biologists were\nhypothesizing that cancer be understood as deviations in tissue\ncompetence that disrupt maintenance of healthy tissue, enabling\nuncontrolled growth (Waddington 1935; Needham 1936a; see also\nAbercrombie, Heaysman, & Karthauser 1957; Sonnenschein & Soto\n1998). More recent conceptually guided work on cancer has reiterated\nthis insight, with many postulating that cancerous growth comprises a\nreversal from the multicellular state to the unicellular state,\namounting essentially to a dissolution of a tissue by disrupting\ntissue-level forces (Chen et al. 2015; see also Trigos et al. 2018).\nThis transition from multicellular to unicellular directly mirrors the\nexperimentally induced emergence of multicellular individuals\ndescribed in the previous section, a pattern noted by the authors\nabove in the case of the snowflake yeast clusters (Ratcliff, Denison,\net al. 2012).\n\nAnother example of synthetic theory involving levels more generally\nconcerns the dynamics of collective behaviors in tissue. Busby and\nSteventon (2021) argue that \u201ctissue tectonics\u201d, that is,\ntissue-level mechanical forces and associated timing, provide a\nmechanism for coordinating morphogenetic events across multiple levels\nof organization (see also Xi et al. 2019; Zinner, Lukonin, &\nLiberali, 2020). One striking example of tissue tectonics concerns the\nsliding of tissue sheets containing populations of cells within the\nrespective sheets, which allows intercellular signaling to occur\nbetween these populations, thus enabling a crucial timing event to\ninduce changes in cell states. One key feature of such examples is the\npreponderance of claims that causality free moves between levels via\nconcrete interactions, both in \u201cupward\u201d and\n\u201cdownward\u201d fashions (Busby & Steventon 2021; Zinner,\nLukonin, & Liberali 2020; see also\n section 5).\n6.7 Usage of levels in the education of biology\n\nThe concept of levels of organization plays a prominent role as a\npedagogical resource in the education of biology. Beginning with the\nnotion\u2019s ubiquitous presence in textbooks and other introductory\nstatements in biology (see Schneewei\u00df & Gropengie\u00dfer\n2019 for a review; examples include, e.g., Begon, Townshend &\nHarper 2006; Lobo 2008; Mader 2010; Urry et al. 2016; O\u2019Neill et\nal. 1986), depictions of levels often dominate the first few pages of\nmajor biology textbooks with large centerfold illustrations stretching\nacross whole pages. In this capacity, the levels concept serves as an\norganizational principle that communicates basic themes of the study\nof biology to aspiring scientists early in their training (Brooks\n2023).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Diagram of levels of\norganization from General Biology (Boundless),\n \u00a71.8;\n CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\nSome of the usage patterns one finds in support of these basic themes\nwithin contemporary textbooks include, e.g., (i) the apparent\npreponderance of emergence in living systems, (ii) the need to be\naware of the relative success of reductive and non-reductive,\n\u201csystemic\u201d approaches to analyzing biological phenomena,\nand (iii) the need to actively embed choices of investigation within\nappropriate methods that are more-or-less useful at different scale\nresolutions. These uses, present already in early historical textbook\nreferences to levels, in turn has been offered as a partial\nexplanation for the rapid uptake of the concept in the textbook\nliterature in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe efforts of Eugene P. Odum (see especially Odum 1959; 1963; cf.\nOdum 1953) in particular imbued the levels concept with a fundamental\ncharacter attached to the study of the life sciences. In his two\nsuccessful series of textbooks Fundamentals of Ecology (five\neditions) and Ecology (two editions), the levels concept was\nfoundational to the structure of the books themselves, following the\ndifferent scale-bound units of ecology. This \u201clevels\napproach\u201d in turn was applied as a means of teaching students to\nsearch for \u201cdistributive adequacy\u201d in the investigative\npractices of scientists (Brooks 2023). That is, Odum presented one\ncore lesson of the levels concept to be that no one level was\nprivileged over others in delivering the \u201cright\u201d answer to\na given scientific question. Instead, investigating multiple levels\nwould be needed to adequately gather results that would satisfactorily\nanswer scientific questions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Levels of organization diagram\nredrawn from Odum 1971, 5.\n\n\nTo be sure, while scientific textbooks often only allude to\ncutting-edge science, preferring to display established knowledge\naccessible to novices, this already enables viewing the levels concept\nas exhibiting usefulness for later stages of scientific training,\nparticularly when seen as a scientific doctrine (see Brooks 2021a:\n47\u201350, for a discussion). Specifically, and especially when\nviewed with the motivation to teach students \u201chow to think like\na biologist\u201d (Urry et al. 2016), the centrality of the levels\nconcept in textbooks can be seen as representative of the expressive\npower of the concept in reconstructing scientific reasoning.\n\nIn addition to active usage as an organizing principle in textbooks,\nthe levels concept has also attracted increasing attention from\nscientific educators for improving and innovating new learning and\nteaching strategies in biology. Noting the concept \u201cas central\nto the study and practice of science\u201d (1999: 3), Wilensky and\nResnik argue that focusing on the levels concept as a pedagogical\ndevice is \u201ccritically important to the understanding of many\nscientific phenomena and many foundational philosophical\nquestions\u201d (1999: 17; see also J\u00f6rdens et al. 2016). More\nrecently, Knippels and Waarlo (2018) have reviewed the implementation\nof the so-called \u201cyo-yo strategy\u201d in biology classrooms as\none explicit means of applying the levels concept to introduce and\n\u201cpromote coherent conceptual understanding of various biological\nphenomena\u201d (Knippels & Waarlo 2018: 1). The yo-yo strategy,\ncharacterized as a \u201cheuristic of systems thinking\u201d\n(ibid.), was explicitly developed to aid grasping complicated\nbiological phenomena (such as Mendelian genetics or biological issues\nassociated with understanding sickle cell anemia), for which more\nlinear forms of learning face difficulties in securing student\ncomprehension (see Knippels & Waarlo 2018 for a discussion). This\nstrategy works by first localizing the contributions of different\nleveled components to primary units of the system (e.g., organism,\ncell, molecule), and then shifting \u201cup and down\u201d between\nthese units to gather insight into the specific contributions that\neach unit expresses for more general biological lessons. A related\napproach to implementing levels into active learning strategies has\nbeen developed by Schneewei\u00df and Gropengie\u00dfer (2022; see\nalso Schneewei\u00df, M\u00f6lgen, & Gropengie\u00dfer 2022).\nTheir \u201czoom map\u201d encourages students to not only explore\ndifferent levels of organization in the construction of explanations,\nthey also place a marked emphasis on interacting with the units\nperched at various levels to encourage learning how different levels\ncontribute to answering different questions posed of the same\nphenomenon.\n7. Concluding remarks\n\nAlthough \u2018levels of organization\u2019 has been a key concept\nin biology and its philosophy since the early twentieth century, there\nis still no consensus on the nature and significance of the concept.\nIn different areas of philosophy and biology, we find strongly varying\nideas of levels, and none of the accounts put forward has received\nwide acceptance. However, emerging work on levels of organization\nsuggests that the insights garnered from the concept are far from\nexhausted.",
