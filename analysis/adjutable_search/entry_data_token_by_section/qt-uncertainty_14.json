    "main_text": "Uncertainty relations for inaccuracy and disturbance\n6.1 The recent debate on error-disturbance relations\n\nWe have seen that in 1927 Heisenberg argued that the measurement of\n(say) position must necessarily disturb the conjugate variable (i.e.,\nmomentum) by an amount that is inversely proportional to the\ninaccuracy of measurement of the former. We have also seen that this\nidea was not maintained in the Kennard\u2019s uncertainty relation\n (9),\n a relation that was embraced by Heisenberg (1930) and most textbooks.\n\nA rather natural question thus arises whether there are further\ninequalities in quantum mechanics that would address\nHeisenberg\u2019s original thinking more directly, i.e., that do deal\nwith how much one variable is disturbed by the accurate measurement of\nanother. That is, we will look at attempts that would establish a\nclaim which may be called a measurement uncertainty\nprinciple.\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, there is no measurement procedure by which one\ncan accurately measure the position of a system without disturbing it\nmomentum, in the sense that some measure of inaccuracy in position and\nsome measure of the disturbance of momentum of the system by the\nmeasurement cannot both be arbitrarily small.\n\n\nThis formulation of the uncertainty principle has always remained\ncontroversial. Uncertainty relations that would express this alleged\nprinciple are often called \u201cerror-disturbance\u201d relations\nor \u201cnoise-disturbance\u201d relations We will look at two\nrecent proposals to search for such relations: Ozawa (2003) and Busch,\nLahti, and Werner (2013).\n\nIn Ozawa\u2019s approach, we assume that a system \\(\\cal S\\) of\ninterest in state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) is coupled to a\nmeasurement device \\(\\cal M\\) in state \\(\\ket{\\chi}\\), and\ntheir interaction is governed by a unitary operator \\(U\\). On the\nHilbert space of the joint system the observable \\(\\bQ\\) of\nthe system \\(\\cal S\\) we are interested in is represented by\n\n\\[\\tag{24} \\bQ_{\\rm in}  =   \\bQ  \\otimes \\mathbb{1}\\]\n\n\n The measurement interaction will allow us to perform an\n(inaccurate) measurement of this quantity by reading off a pointer\nobservable \\(\\boldsymbol{Q'}\\) of the measurement device after the\ninteraction. Hence this inaccurate observable may be represented as\n\n\\[\\tag{25}\n\\bQ'_{\\rm out} = U^\\dagger( \\mathbb{1} \\otimes \\bQ') U\\]\n\n\nThe measure of noise in the measurement of \\(\\bQ\\) is then\nchosen as: \n\n\\[\\tag{26} \n\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ) := \\expval{(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - \\bQ_{\\rm in})^2}_{\\psi \\otimes \\chi}^{1/2}\\]\n\n\nA comparison of the initial momentum \n \\(\\bP_{\\rm in} = \\bP \\otimes \\mathbb{1}\\) \nand the final momentum after the measurement \n \\(\\bP_{\\rm out} = U^\\dagger (\\bP \\otimes \\mathbb{1})U\\) is made by choosing \na measure of the disturbance of \\(\\bP\\) by the measurement procedure: \n\n\\[\\tag{27} \n\\eta_\\psi(\\bP):= \\expval{(\\bP_{\\rm in} - \\bP_{\\rm out})^2}_{\\psi\\otimes\\chi}^{1/2}\n\\]\n\n\n Ozawa\nobtained an inequality involving those two measures, which, however,\nis more involved than previous uncertainty relations. For our\npurposes, however, the important point is that Ozawa showed that the\nproduct \\(\\epsilon_\\psi (\\bQ) \\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\)\nhas no positive lower bound. His conclusion from this was that\nHeisenberg\u2019s noise-disturbance relation is violated.\n\nYet, whether Ozawa\u2019s result indeed succeeds in formulating\nHeisenberg\u2019s qualitative discussion of disturbance and accuracy\nin the microscope example has come under dispute. See Busch, Lahti and\nWerner (2013, and 2014 (Other Internet Resources)), and Ozawa (2013,\nOther Internet Resources).\n\nAn objection raised in this dispute is that a quantity like\n\\(\\expval{(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - \\bQ_{\\rm in})^2}^{1/2}\\) tells us very\nlittle about how good the observable \\({\\bQ'}_{\\rm out}\\) can stand in\nas an inaccurate measurement of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\). The main point to\nobserve here is that these operators generally do not commute, and\nthat measurements of \\(\\bQ'_{\\rm out}\\), of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\) and of\ntheir difference will require altogether three different measurement\ncontexts. To require that \\(\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ)\\) vanishes, for\nexample, means only that the state prepared belongs to the linear\nsubspace corresponding to the zero eigenvalue of the operator \n\\(\\bQ'_{\\rm out} - {\\bQ}_{\\rm in}\\), and therefore that \n\\(\\expval{\\bQ'_{\\rm out}}_\\psi = \\expval{\\bQ_{\\rm in}}_\\psi\\), \nbut this does not preclude that the probability\ndistribution of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm out}\\) in state \\(\\psi\\) might be wildly\ndifferent from that of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\). But then no one would think\nof \\(\\bQ_{\\rm out}\\) as an accurate measurement of \\(\\bQ_{\\rm in}\\)\nso that the definition of \\(\\epsilon_\\psi(\\bQ)\\) does not express what\nit is supposed to express. A similar objection can also be raised\nagainst \\(\\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\).\n\nAnother observation is that Ozawa\u2019s conclusion that there is no\nlower bound for his error-disturbance product for is not at all\nsurprising. That is, even without probing the system by a measurement\napparatus, one can show that such a lower bound does not exist. If the\ninitial state of a system is prepared at time \\(t=0\\) as a Gaussian\nquasi-monochromatic wave packet with \\(\\expval{\\bQ_0}_\\psi =0\\) and \nevolves freely, we can use a time-of-flight\nmeasurement to learn about its later position. Ehrenfest\u2019s\ntheorem tells us: \\(\\expval{\\bQ_t}_\\psi = \\frac{t}{m} \\expval{\\bP}_\\psi\\).\n\nHence, as an approximative measurement of the position\n\\(\\bQ_t\\), one could propose the observable\n\\(\\bQ'_t = \\frac{t}{m}\\bP\\). It is known that\nunder the stated conditions (and with \\(m\\) and \\(t\\) large) this\napproximation holds very well, i.e., we do not only have \n\\(\\expval{\\bQ'_t -\\bQ_t}_\\psi =0\\), but also \n\\(\\expval{(\\bQ'_t -\\bQ_t)^2} \\approx 0\\),\nas nearly as we please. But since \\(\\bQ'_t\\) is just the\nmomentum multiplied by a constant, its measurement will obviously not\ndisturb the momentum of the system. In other words, for this example,\none has \\(\\epsilon_\\psi (\\bQ)\\) as small as we please with\nzero disturbance of the momentum. Therefore, any hopes that there\ncould be a positive lower bound for the product \\(\\epsilon_\\psi\n(\\bQ) \\eta_\\psi (\\bP)\\) seem to be dashed, even\nwith the simplest of measurement schemes, i.e.\u00a0a free evolution.\n\nOzawa\u2019s results do not show that Heisenberg\u2019s analysis of\nthe microscope argument was wrong. Rather, they throw doubt on the\nappropriateness of the definitions he used to formalize\nHeisenberg\u2019s informal argument.\n\nAn entirely different analysis of the problem of substantiating a\nmeasurement uncertainty relation was offered by Busch, Lahti, and\nWerner (2013). These authors consider a measurement device \\(\\cal M\\)\nthat makes a joint unsharp measurement of both position and momentum.\nTo describe such joint unsharp measurements, they employ the extended\nmodern formalism that characterizes obervables not by self-adjoint\noperators but by positive-operator-valued measures (POVM\u2019s). In\nthe present case, this means that the measurement procedure is\ncharacterized by a collection of positive operators, \\(M(p,q)\\), where\nthe pair \\(p,q\\) represent the outcome variables of the measurement,\nwith \n\n\\[\\tag{28}\nM(p,q) \\geq 0, \\iint \\! dp dq \\, M(p,q) =\\mathbb{1} .\\]\n\n\nThe two marginals of this POVM, \n\n\\[\\tag{29}\n\\begin{align*}\nM_1(q)   &= \\int\\! dp  M(p,q)\\\\\nM_2(p)   &= \\int\\! dq  M(p,q)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\n are also POVM\u2019s in\ntheir own right and represent the unsharp position \\(Q'\\) and unsharp\nmomentum \\(P'\\) observables respectively. (Note that these do\nnot refer to a self-adjoint operator!)\n\nFor a system prepared in a state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\), the joint\nprobability density of obtaining outcomes \\((p,q)\\) in the joint\nunsharp measurement\n (28)\n is then \n\n\\[\\tag{30}\n\\rho(p,q) := \\expvalexp{M(p,q)}{\\psi},\\]\n\n while the marginals of this joint probability\ndistribution give the distributions for \\(Q'\\) and \\(P'\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align*} \n\\tag{31} \\mu'(q) &: = \\int \\! dp \\, \\rho(p,q) = \\expvalexp{M_1(q)}{\\psi} \\\\\n\\notag  \\nu'(p) &:= \\int \\! dp \\, \\rho(p,q) = \\expvalexp{M_2(q)}{\\psi} \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n Since a joint sharp measurement of position and momentum\nis impossible in quantum mechanics, these marginal distributions\n (31)\n obtained from \\(M\\) will differ from that of ideal measurements of\n\\(\\bQ\\) and of \\(\\bP\\) on the system of interest\nin state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\). However, one can indicate how\nmuch these marginals deviate from separate exact position and momentum\nmeasurements on the state \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) by a pairwise\ncomparison of\n (31)\n to the exact distributions \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\tag{32} \\mu(q)  &:= \\abs{\\braket{q}{\\psi}}^2 \\\\\n\\notag   \\nu(p)  &:= \\abs{\\braket{p}{\\psi}}^2\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nIn order to do so, BLW propose a distance function \\(D\\) between\nprobability distributions, such that \\(D(\\mu, \\mu')\\) tells us how\nclose the marginal position distribution \\(\\mu'(q)\\) for the unsharp\nposition \\(Q'\\) is to the exact distribution \\(\\mu(q)\\) in a sharp\nposition measurement, and likewise, \\(D(\\nu ,\\nu')\\) tells us how\nclose the marginal momentum distribution \\(\\nu'(p)\\) for \\(P'\\) is to\nthe exact momentum distribution \\(\\nu(p)\\).\n\nThe distance they chose is the Wasserstein-2 distance, a.k.a. (a\nvariation on) the earth-movers distance.\n\nDefinition (Wasserstein-2 distance)\n\nLet \\(\\mu(x)\\) and \\(\\mu'(y)\\) be any two probability distributions on\nthe real line, and \\(\\gamma(x,y)\\) any joint probability distribution\nthat has \\(\\mu'\\) and \\(\\mu\\) as its marginals. Then: \n\n\\[\\tag{33} \nD(\\mu, \\mu') := \\inf_\\gamma \\left(\\iint (x-y)^2 \\gamma (x,y) dx dy \\right)^{1/2}\\]\n\n\nApplying this definition to the case at hand, i.e.\u00a0 pairwise to the\nquantum mechanical distributions \\(\\mu'(q)\\) and \\(\\mu(q)\\) and to\n\\(\\nu'(p)\\) and \\(\\nu(p)\\) in\n (31)\n and\n (32),\n BLW\u2019s final step is to take a supremum over all possible input\nstates \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) to obtain \n\n\\[\\tag{34}\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Delta(Q, Q') & =   \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}}  D(\\mu, \\mu')  \\\\\n\\Delta(P, P') & =   \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}}  D(\\nu, \\nu')\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n From these\ndefinitions, they obtain \n\n\\[\\tag{35}\\Delta(Q, Q')   \\Delta (P,P')   \\geq   \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\]\n\n\nArguing that \\(\\Delta(Q, Q')\\) provides a sensible measure for the\ninaccuracy or noise about position, and \\(\\Delta(P, P')\\) for the\ndisturbance of momentum by any such joint unsharp measurement, the\nauthors conclude, in contrast to Ozawa\u2019s analysis, that an\nerror-disturbance uncertainty relation does hold, which they take as\n\u201ca remarkable vindication of Heisenberg\u2019s\nintuitions\u201d in the microscope thought experiment.\n\nIn comparison of the two, there are a few positive remarks to make\nabout the Busch-Lahti-Werner (BLW) approach. First of all, by focusing\non the distance\n (33)\n this approach is comparing entire probability distributions\nrather than just the expectations of operator differences. When this\ndistance is very small, one is justified to conclude that the\ndistribution has changed very little under the measurement procedure.\nThis brings us closer to the conclusion that the error or disturbance\nintroduced is small. Secondly, by introducing a supremum over all\nstates to obtain \\(\\Delta( Q, Q')\\), it follows that when this latter\nexpression is small, the measured distribution \\(\\mu'\\) differs only\nlittle from the exact distribution \\(\\mu\\) whatever the state of\nthe system is. As the authors argue, this means that\n\\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\) can be seen as a figure-of-merit of the measurement\ndevice alone, and in this sense analogous to the resolving power of a\nmicroscope.\n\nBut we also think there is an undesirable feature of the BLW approach.\nThis is due to the supremum over states appearing twice, both\nin \\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\) and in \\(\\Delta(P,P')\\). This feature, we argue,\ndeprives their result from practical applicability.\n\nTo elucidate: In concrete applications, one would prepare a system in\nsome state (not exactly known) and perform a given joint measurement\n\\(M\\) of \\(Q'\\) and \\(P'\\). If it is given that, say, \\(\\Delta(Q,Q')\\)\nis very small, one can safely infer that \\(Q\\) has been measured with\nsmall inaccuracy, since this guarantees that the measured position\ndistribution differs very little from what an exact position\nmeasurement would give, regardless of the state of the system. Now,\none would like to be able to infer that in this case the disturbance\nof the momentum \\(P\\) from \\(P'\\) must be considerable for the\nstate prepared. But the BLW only gives us: \n\n\\[\n\\Delta(P, P') = \\sup_{\\ket{\\psi}} D(\\nu, \\nu') \\geq \n   \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta(Q, Q')}\n\\]\n\n\n and this\ndoes not imply anything for the state in question! Thus, the BLW\nuncertainty relation does not rule out that for some states it might\nbe possible to perform a joint measurement in which both \\(D(\\mu,\n\\mu')\\) and \\(D(\\nu, \\nu')\\) are very small, and in this sense have\nnegligibe error and disturbance. It seems premature to say that this\nvindicates Heisenberg\u2019s intuitions.\n\nSumming up, we emphasize that there is no contradiction between the\nBLW analysis and the Ozawa analysis: where Ozawa claims that the\nproduct of two quantities might for some states be less than the usual\nlimit, BLW show that product of different quantities will satisfy this\nlimit. The dispute is not about mathematically validity, but about how\nreasonable these quantities are to capture Heisenberg\u2019s\nqualitative considerations. The present authors feel that, in this\ndispute, Ozawa\u2019s analysis fail to be convincing. On the other\nhand, we also think that the BLW uncertainty relation is not\nsatisfactory. Also, we would like to remark that both protagonists\nemploy measures that are akin to standard deviations in being very\nsensitive to the tail behavior of probability distributions, and thus\nface a similar objection as raised in\n section 5.\n The final word in this dispute on whether a measurement uncertainty\nprinciple holds has not been reached, in our view.\n",
