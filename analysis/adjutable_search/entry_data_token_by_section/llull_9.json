    "main_text": "Metaphysics || The principles\n3.1 The principles\n\n\nGoodness is that whereby good does good.\n\n\nThat is how Ramon Llull defines the first principle in his Ars\nbrevis 3\u20131. The principles are axioms that Ramon Llull will\nformulate based on the Dignities. He defines them as principles of\nexistence and action (principia existendi et agendi). As\nprinciples of existence, they are abstract and allude to the\nDignities. As principles of action, they are used to apply the\nArs to the knowledge of particular sciences, such as law,\nnavigation, and astrology, among others. The principles can be\nabsolute, if they are taken by themselves, or relative, if they are\napplied to a particular subject (e.g., Peter is great). Llull explains\nin Ars Brevis this quality of the principles as\n\n\na ladder for ascending and descending; as, for instance, descending\nfrom a completely general principle to one neither completely general\nnor completely particular, and from a principle neither completely\ngeneral nor completely particular to one that is completely\nparticular.
