    "main_text": "The Legacy from Antiquity || Sixteenth-Century Innovations\n2.3 Sixteenth-Century Innovations\n\n Although Aristotle's views dominated medieval scholasticism, there\noccurred a renewed interest in atomism in the early 17th\nCentury. Apart from general factors such as the Renaissance, Humanism,\nand the Reformation, specific innovations of the 16th Century made it\nattractive. Although Copernicus' introduction of a helio-static system\nwas motivated by a strict adherence to Aristotle's dynamics of\ncelestial spheres, it brought into question his terrestial\nphysics. Galileo's telescopic observations of the surface of the moon and\nhis discovery of moons orbiting about Jupiter brought into question\nthe very distinction between the terrestial and the\ncelestial. Moreover, the visibility of an abundance of new stars,\napparently without end, suggested that the universe may in fact be\nwithout bound.  \n",
