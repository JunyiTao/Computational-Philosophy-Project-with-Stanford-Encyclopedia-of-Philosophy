    "main_text": "Antirealism: Foils for Scientific Realism || Feminist Approaches\n4.4 Feminist Approaches\n\nFeminist engagements with science are linked thematically to SSK and\nforms of social constructivism by their recognition of the role of\nsocial factors as determinants of scientific fact. That said, they\nextend the analysis in a more specific way, reflecting particular\nconcerns about the marginalization of points of view based on gender,\nethnicity, socio-economic status, and political status. Not all\nfeminist approaches are antirealist, but nearly all are normative,\noffering prescriptions for revising both scientific practice and\nconcepts such as objectivity and knowledge that have direct\nimplications for realism. In this regard it is useful to distinguish\n(as originally proposed in Harding 1986) between three broad\napproaches. Feminist empiricism focuses on the possibility of\nwarranted belief within scientific communities as a function of the\ntransparency and consideration of biases associated with different\npoints of view which enter into scientific work. Standpoint theory\ninvestigates the idea that scientific knowledge is inextricably linked\nto perspectives arising from differences in such points of view.\nFeminist postmodernism rejects traditional conceptions of universal or\nabsolute objectivity and truth. (As one might expect, these views are\nnot always neatly distinguishable; for some early, influential\napproaches, see Keller 1985; Harding 1986; Haraway 1988; Longino 1990,\n2002; Alcoff & Potter 1993; and Nelson & Nelson 1996).\n\nThe notion of objectivity has a number of traditional\nconnotations\u2014including disinterest (detachment, lack of bias)\nand universality (independence from any particular perspective or\nviewpoint)\u2014which are commonly associated with knowledge of a\nmind-independent world. Feminist critiques are almost unanimous in\nrejecting scientific objectivity in the sense of disinterest, offering\ncase studies that aim to demonstrate how the presence of (for\nexample) androcentric bias in a scientific community can lead to the\nacceptance of one theory at the expense of alternatives (Kourany 2010:\nchs. 1\u20133; for detailed cases, see Longino 1990: ch. 6 and Lloyd\n2006). Arguably, the failure of objectivity in this sense is\nconsistent with realism under certain conditions. For example, if the\nrelevant bias is epistemically neutral (that is, if one\u2019s\nassessment of scientific evidence is not influenced by it one way or\nanother), then realism may remain at least one viable interpretation\nof the outputs of scientific work. In the more interesting case where\nbias is epistemically consequential, the prospects for realism are\ndiminished, but may be enhanced by a scientific infrastructure that\nfunctions to bring it under scrutiny (by means of, for example,\neffective peer review, genuine consideration of minority views, etc.),\nthus facilitating corrective measures where appropriate. The\ncontention that the sciences do not generally exemplify such an\ninfrastructure is one motivation for the normativity of much feminist\nempiricism.\n\nThe challenge to objectivity in the sense of universality or\nperspective-independence can be, in some cases, more difficult to\nsquare with the possibility of realism. In a Marxist vein, some\nstandpoint theorists argue that certain perspectives are epistemically\nprivileged in the realm of science: viz., subjugated\nperspectives are epistemically privileged in comparison to dominant\nones in light of the deeper insight afforded the former (just as the\nproletariat has a deeper knowledge of human potential than the\nsuperficial knowledge typical of those in power). Others portray\nepistemic privilege in a more splintered or deflationary manner,\nsuggesting that no one point of view can be established as superior to\nanother by any overarching standard of epistemological assessment.\nThis view is most explicit in feminist postmodernism, which embraces a\nthoroughgoing relativism with respect to truth (and presumably\napproximate truth, scientific ontology, and other notions central to\nvarious descriptions of realism). As in the case of Strong Program\nSSK, truth and epistemic standards are here defined only within the\ncontext of a perspective, and thus cannot be interpreted in any\ncontext-transcendent or mind-independent manner.\n",
