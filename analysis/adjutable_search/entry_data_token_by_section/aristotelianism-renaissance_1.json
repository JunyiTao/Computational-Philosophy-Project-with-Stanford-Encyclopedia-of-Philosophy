Philosophy at Renaissance Universities\n\n\nAlthough there seems to be no simple answer to the question of which\nRenaissance institutions of \u201chigher education\u201d should be\nconsidered as\n \u201cuniversities\u201d;[13]  \n there is neither doubt nor conflict about the fact, that there were\nmany universities, and that many of them were founded in the\n Renaissance.[14]  \n And at virtually all of them much of the philosophy taught there was\ndirectly or indirectly founded on parts of the corpus\naristotelicum. And, given the wide range of texts (commentaries,\ntreatises, textbooks, collections of theses for disputations \u2026)\nmaking use of that corpus and being related directly or\nindirectly to some sort of \u201cuniversitarian\u201d context and/or\nuse, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of the texts this\nentry is about are texts related directly or indirectly to some sort\nof such context and/or use, perhaps \u201cRenaissance University\nTexts in Philosophy\u201d might be an even better description for\nwhat this entry is about than its real title \u201cAristotelianism in\nthe Renaissance\u201d.\n\n\nIn general, only some of the fields covered by the corpus\naristotelicum were part of any single university curriculum. We\ndo not yet have a survey on what was taught where and when, so we\ncannot yet give a complete\n assessment,[15]  \n but permitting some margin of error, we can say:\n\nLogic was taught everywhere (in some cases with a special\nstress on the Prior Analytics material and in some cases with special\nstress on the Posterior Analytics material, and in some cases with a\nspecial stress on Topics and argumentation, and in later times\u2014perhaps starting with Antonius Rubius[16]\u2014also on the Categories).\n Philosophy of nature was widely taught: more intensively\nin universities where philosophy students tended to pursue a medical\ndegree (e.g., in Bologna and Padua) and less intensively in\nuniversities where philosophy students were trained for going on with\ntheology (e.g., many Protestant universities and the institutions of\nhigher education run by religious orders). Apparently the material\ntaught most prominently was what can be found in De anima II\nand III and Physics, rather prominently what can be found in\nDe c\u0153lo and Meteora, and only rather rarely what can be found in the rest\nof the libri naturales.\nMetaphysics was sometimes a niche subject without any\nrelevance for the regular degree examinations (e.g., in Padua),\nsometimes of utmost importance (as in some Protestant cases), and\nsometimes somewhere in-between (e.g., in Ingolstadt).\nThe stress laid on moral philosophy differed\nconsiderably, and generally ethics was far more prominent than\npolitics\u2014let alone\n economics.[17]\n\n\n\nIt seems difficult (or even impossible) to find a single statement on\nwhich all known Renaissance \u201cAristotelians\u201d\nagree. This may be due, in part, to the specialization of teachers\n(Melanchthon not agreeing that all knowledge rises from the senses,\nCremonini disinterested in moral philosophy and thus not making\nstatements on virtues, \u2026). \n\n\nThere are a few explicit statements of the reasons for basing the\nteaching of philosophy at universities on the corpus\naristotelicum or works derived from it. Augustinus Niphus (died\n1538)\u2014who probably gave the fullest treatment of this\nquestion\u2014gives the following\n reasons (Niphus, 1544, f. \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 2vb): \n The parts of philosophy are treated by Aristotle one by one in books\neach of which is dedicated to just one part of philosophy; he proceeds\nfrom what is better known to us to that which is less known to us; he\nfinds out about things by discussing views held by others; he treats\neverything with apt ampleness and conciseness; his style is that of a\nphilosopher and not that of an orator; he is consistent.\n\n\nPhilipp Melanchthon states, in his 1536 oration \u201cOn\nPhilosophy\u201d (Melanchthon, 1843), that you have to choose a\ngenre of philosophy which is not sophistic, and which adheres\nto the correct method, and that the one taught by Aristotle is such a\n philosophy.[18]\n (He then continues to reject stoic, epicurean and platonic\nalternatives \u2026\u00a0.)\n \n\nNote that neither Niphus nor Melanchthon claim that a reason for using\nthe corpus aristotelicum as the basis of teaching philosophy\nat universities is the truth of any of Aristotle\u2019s\n statements.[19] \n Melanchthon goes on to request that, in addition to Aristotle, other\nauthors should be used for some fields, something that is admitted\nalso by\n Niphus.[20]  \n Philosophy taught at Renaissance universities uses Aristotle as its\nmain starting point and main basis, but (at least in many cases)\nAristotle (together with his commentators) is not the only basis of\nphilosophy taught at Renaissance\n universities.[21] \n\n\nInterest in Renaissance university philosophy has been rekindled by\nErnest Renan who investigated several philosophers teaching at Padua\n(Renan, 1866), and \u201cPaduan\u201d Renaissance university\nphilosophy is the part of \u201cRenaissance Aristotelianism\u201d\nthat has been most thoroughly studied. But as research progresses and\nmore knowledge is gained about more universities and authors, the\nimage gets more complex and less apt for generalizations. This adds\ninsight into the diversity of the traditions at each university and\nthe diversity of philosophies taught by teachers at each \n one.[22] \n These teachers are probably best studied as single philosophers, and\nnot as mere adherents or members of some\n school.[23]\n",
