    "main_text": "Zhang Xichun on Chinese Philosophy and Chinese Medicine\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nIn conclusion, this brief account addresses important issues in the\nconnections between Chinese philosophy and the development of Chinese\nmedicine. Philosophical texts clearly influenced medicine in\nseveral ways. First, both are grounded in theories of qi,\nyin-yang and wuxing and microcosm-macrocosm analogies\nbased on them. However, as in the case of science more generally,\nphilosophical textualists emerged as a distinct social group from the\nfang shi, especially. Nonetheless, we can trace\nphilosophical concerns in several areas of medical interest, especially\nthe ongoing history of \u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang\nsheng) practices, first described in philosophical texts but\nelaborated in great and practical detail by physicians and alchemists\nsuch as Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun Simiao. This linkage is\nmade explicit by one of the greatest of China\u2019s twentieth-century\nphysicians and medical reformers, Zhang Xichun, who unequivocally\ndescribes philosophy as the basis of medicine.\n",
