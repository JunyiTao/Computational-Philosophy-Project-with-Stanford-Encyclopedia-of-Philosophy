    "preamble": "\n\nAccording to\n David Hume,\n the impossible cannot be conceived.\n Moritz Schlick\n claimed that the logically impossible, such as an explicit\ninconsistency, is simply unthinkable. Yet\n Hegel\n complained that it is \u201cone of the fundamental prejudices of\nlogic as hitherto understood\u201d that \u201cthe contradictory\ncannot be imagined or thought\u201d (Hegel 1831: 430). On this\napproach, our representational capabilities are not limited to the\npossible: we are able to conceive, describe, and sometimes even\nbelieve, impossibilities.\n\nThis entry is about impossibilities. In order to read it fruitfully,\nyou might also want to consult the entry on\n possible worlds.\n Many accounts of impossible worlds are best understood against the\nbackground of possible worlds theories \u2014 although symmetries and\nsimilarities can sometimes break down in important respects. (We will\nsee one in\n section 4\n below.) You might also want to look at the entry on\n modal logic\n to grasp some basic notions of worlds semantics.\n\nWe commonly speak of things being impossible in a relative\nsense. If you are stuck in a traffic jam in Paris Montparnasse at 2\nPM, and your flight is leaving from airport Charles De Gaulle at 2:30\nPM, you may moan: \u201cThere is no way that I can make it to the\nairport in time\u201d. What you mean is that, given the timing, the\nmeans of transport available, and other circumstances, it is\nimpossible for you to reach the airport in time. It is not absolutely\nimpossible: if you had Star Trek\u2019s transporter, you could make\nit.\n\nThis entry is about worlds that are not possible, with\n\u201cpossible\u201d understood in an unrestricted sense. Start with\nthe intuitive idea of the totality of possible worlds, which capture\nall and only the genuine possibilities. The worlds we are interested\nin are not in there. These worlds are often called logically\nimpossible worlds, as logical laws such as the Law of\nNon-Contradiction or the Law of Excluded Middle are assumed to be the\nmost general and topic-neutral: they are supposed to hold at all\npossible worlds. From now on, we are talking of impossible worlds\nsimpliciter, meaning worlds that are not possible with\nrespect to an unrestricted notion of possibility, however this is\nfurther characterized.\n\nA look at the rapidly growing literature on impossible worlds (see\nNolan 2013 for a survey) presents us with a number of definitions.\nThese can be reduced to four main items:\n\nImpossible Ways: just as possible worlds are often introduced\nintuitively by characterising them as ways things could have been, so\nare impossible worlds often characterized as ways things could not\nhave been. The initial insight is that not everything is possible,\nthat is, some things just (absolutely) cannot happen. Anything that\njust can\u2019t happen must be an absolute impossibility; and these\nways the world just couldn\u2019t be are impossible worlds (see e.g.\nSalmon 1984; Yagisawa 1988; Restall 1997; Beall and van Fraassen\n2003).\n\nLogic Violators: another definition has it that impossible\nworlds are worlds where the laws of logic fail (where these may be\ntheorems of the target logic, or its logical truths, or valid\nconsequences, etc.). This depends on what we take the laws of logic to\nbe. Given some logic L, an impossible world with respect to the L-laws\nis one in which some of those laws fail to hold (see e.g. Priest 2001,\nChapter 9). An impossible world in this second sense will be an\nimpossible world in the first sense, given that logical necessity is\nunrestricted. But not vice versa. Suppose it\u2019s metaphysically\nnecessary that the Mona Lisa (if it exists) was painted by da\nVinci. Then a world in which the Mona Lisa was painted by\nNeil Buchanan on Art Attack is an impossible world in the\nfirst sense but not in the second, for it does not violate any logical\nlaw.\n\nClassical Logic Violators: another definition has it that\nimpossible worlds are worlds where the laws of classical\nlogic fail (see e.g. Priest 1997a). A world complying with\n intuitionistic logic,\n and where instances of the Law of Excluded Middle fail, will be\nimpossible in the third sense.\n\nContradiction-Realizers: a still more specific definition has\nit that an impossible world is a world where sentences of the form\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold, against the Law of Non-Contradiction (see\ne.g. Lycan 1994). Impossible worlds of the fourth kind will be\nimpossible in the third sense, but not vice versa. Our intuitionistic\nworld above will have the Law of Non-Contradiction hold\nunrestrictedly: it will be impossible in the third, but not in the\nfourth sense.\n\nThese are all absolute notions of impossibility: in any of these\nsenses, a world is either possible or impossible. One may relativise\nthe notion, e.g. by allowing what counts as a law of logic to differ\nbetween worlds. Then (as Sandgren and Tanaka 2020 point out), one\nworld\u2019s laws may be a proper subset of the laws of a second world. In\nthis scenario, each world would be impossible relative to the other\n(since they differ in what they take the laws to be), even though the\nformer does not violate any of the laws of the latter. (See also\nTanaka 2018, 2022.) This relativised notion of logical impossibly is\nrelatively new and under-explored.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Reasons for Introducing Impossible Worlds\n\nWhy might one believe in impossible worlds? One argument is the\nso-called \u201cargument from ways\u201d (Vander Laan 1997), which\nis related to the first definition of impossible world given above.\nThis draws on the analogy with\n David Lewis\u2019s\n notorious argument concerning our quantifying over ways things could\nhave been (see Lewis 1973: 84). The world could have been different in\nso many ways: Hilary Clinton could have won the 2016 US election, I\ncould be dancing on the ceiling, and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem could\nhave remained without proof. Our belief in possible worlds is just a\nparaphrase of our belief that there are many ways the world could have\nbeen.\n\nAren\u2019t there also ways the world could not have been?\nSome authors endorse the claim that anything is possible\n(e.g. Mortensen 1989). However, the majority of philosophers believe\nthat not everything is possible, in the sense that some things just\ncan\u2019t happen. If I tell you that my college has a\ncupola which is both fully round and fully square, you are likely to\nreply, \u201cit can\u2019t be that way!\u201d. So it seems\nthat \u201c\u2018ways\u2019 talk goes both ways\u201d (Beall and\nvan Fraassen 2003: 86). If quantification on ways the world could have\nbeen should be taken at face value as providing evidence for possible\nworlds, then quantification on ways the world could not have been\nshould be taken at face value as providing evidence for impossible\nworlds.\n\nThe argument as such is hardly convincing. Firstly, one author\u2019s\nmodus ponens is another\u2019s modus tollens. Some\nhave used similar considerations to argue against Lewis\u2019s modal\nrealism (see Skyrms 1976; Naylor 1986): if one believes in possible\nworlds (of the Lewisian kind) as ways things could have been, then by\nparity of reasoning one should believe in impossible worlds (ditto) as\nways things could not have been. But impossible worlds are too much to\nswallow, so (by modus tollens) one should not believe in\nLewis\u2019s modal realism.\n\nSecondly, taking quantification over any kind of entity whatsoever at\nface value, just because it is embedded in ordinary language,\ndoesn\u2019t look like a promising general strategy. Lewis\u2019s\ncase for accepting commitment to possible worlds did not consist just\nin an argument from ways. He also provided independent\nmotivation for taking quantification over possible worlds at face\nvalue. A non-reductive account of possible worlds, according to Lewis,\nbrings net theoretical utility. The ontological cost is compensated by\na theoretical gain, given the variety of ontological, semantic, and\nconceptual explanations allowed by our taking the notion of possible\nworld seriously. This is likely to be the main motivation for\nbelieving in impossible worlds. As we will see below, defenders of\nimpossible worlds claim that they are are theoretically useful.\n\nAnother argument on behalf of impossible worlds, quite pervasive in\nthe literature, comes from counterpossible reasoning (e.g.\nBeall and van Fraassen 2003, Chapter 4; Nolan 1997; Restall 1997;\nBrogaard and Salerno 2013). This is reasoning from suppositions,\nassumptions, or conditional antecedents which are not only false, but\nimpossible. We can reason non-trivially from impossible suppositions,\nby asking what would be the case, were (say) the Law of\nExcluded Middle false. To say that we reason non-trivially\nfrom an assumption means just that we accept some conclusions but\nreject others on the basis of that assumption. If we hypothetically\nsuppose the Law of Excluded Middle to be false, for example, then we\nwould likely conclude that intuitionistic logic would be preferable to\nclassical logic, given that supposition. We are unlikely to conclude\nthat classical logic would be a satisfactory logic, or that scarlet\nwould be a shade of green, given that supposition. The point readily\ngeneralizes to reasoning about entire theories and to serious\nphilosophical and logical debates. We often reason from suppositions\nabout the truth of certain logical, mathematical, or metaphysical\ntheories which, if in fact false, are necessarily false, because of\nthe very nature of their subject matter.\n\nThis kind of reasoning is related to our assessment of certain\nconditional statements with impossible antecedents, often called\ncounterpossible conditionals or, more simply,\ncounterpossibles. These include:\n\n(1.1)  If Hobbes had\nsquared the circle, then mathematicians would have been\namazed.\n\nLet\u2019s call a conditional like this trivially true when\nit is true and the conditional with the same antecedent and opposite\n(negated) consequent is also true. (1.1)\u200b\u200b is intuitively\ntrue, and yet\n\n(1.2)  If Hobbes had\nsquared the circle, then mathematicians would not have been\namazed.\n\nis intuitively false. If that\u2019s correct, then there are\nnon-trivially true counterpossibles. These considerations impact on\nour preferred semantics for such conditionals, for the possible worlds\nsemantics for conditionals has trouble accommodating this position.\nYet the analysis in terms of worlds does a good job for conditionals\nwith possible antecedents. This motivates a semantics for\ncounterpossibles in terms of impossible (as well as possible) worlds.\nWe will get into more detail in\n section 2.5.\n\nThese kinds of argument highlight the usefulness of impossible worlds\nas devices for analyzing particular linguistic, logical, and\nphilosophical issues. The point can be expanded into the general\n\u201cargument from utility\u201d mentioned above: we should believe\nin impossible worlds because they are useful tools for logicians and\nphilosophers. Whether that general argument is acceptable depends on\nhow persuasive the specific impossible worlds analyses are.\nLet\u2019s look at some.\n2. Applications of Impossible Worlds\n\nThis section briefly describes various applications of impossible\nworlds, which collectively provide the main motivation for introducing\nthem.\n2.1 Intentional States\n\nModelling intentional states, such as knowledge and belief, is a\nprominent motivation for introducing impossible worlds. The intuitive\nidea is that one gains knowledge or belief by ruling out would-be\npossibilities (the epistemic/doxastic possibilities for that\nagent). An agent\u2019s knowledge is whatever is true according to\nall epistemically possible worlds accessible to that agent, i.e., the\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the agent knows\n(and similarly for belief).\n\nImpossible worlds are useful within this approach because these\nwould-be possibilities often turn out to be impossible. Our beliefs\nare often (covertly) inconsistent with one another. Moreover, our\nknowledge and belief is not closed under (classical) logical\nconsequence: we do not know or believe all consequences of what we\nknow or believe. It is hard to accommodate these features using only\npossible worlds. Possible worlds models usually generate the problem\nof logical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic),\n which we will discuss in\n section 5.3.\n\nOne feature of rational agents\u2019 intentional states is that they\ntypically reject obvious impossibility or absurdity whilst\nbeing subject to subtle inconsistency (Lewis 2004). One\nattempt to capture this feature is developed in Jago 2006, 2007, 2009,\n2014a. The idea is that only genuine possibilities and non-obvious\nimpossibilities should be epistemically accessible to rational (but\nimperfect) agents such as us. For some agents, it may be epistemically\npossible that Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u2019s is false, but 0\nbeing 1 shouldn\u2019t be epistemically possible for anyone.\nThat\u2019s why we know the latter but may fail to know the former,\nsays Jago. One worry with this approach is that it is partly\nproof-theoretic (invoking proof rules as relations between worlds),\nwhereas it isn\u2019t clear that proof length correlates well with\nobviousness. Bjerring (2013) presents other objections to the view. A\nstrategy similar to Jago\u2019s is adopted in Berto 2014, 2017.\n\nA quite different application of impossible worlds to epistemic states\nhas been proposed by JC Beall 2009, in relation to the\n Church-Fitch knowability paradox.\n The Church-Fitch reasoning is supposed to show that is contradictory\nto suppose that any truth can be known (as some anti-realists claim).\nThe reasoning is this. Suppose all truths are knowable but some are\nnot in fact known. Then some truth \\(A\\), is not known: \\(A \\wedge\n\\neg KA\\). By assumption, it\u2019s possible to know this: \\(\\Diamond\nK(A \\wedge \\neg KA)\\). Seemingly good reasoning (in classical\nepistemic logic) implies that it\u2019s possible both to know and not\nknow that \\(A\\): \\(\\Diamond(KA \\wedge \\neg KA)\\), which of course\nisn\u2019t possible at all. The usual moral to draw is that not all\ntruths are knowable. Beall\u2019s idea, by contrast, is that the\nknowability principle can be maintained (and the corresponding kind of\nanti-realism along with it). His suggestion is to deny\ndistribution of knowledge over conjunction: the principle\nthat knowing that \\(A \\wedge B\\) implies knowing that \\(A\\) and\nknowing that \\(B\\). He achieves this using impossible worlds in which\nconjunctions may be true even if their conjuncts are not.\n2.2 Inconsistent Information\n\nClosely connected with inconsistent information (e.g., information\nincluding or entailing contradictions) is the issue of modelling\ninconsistent databases (see Belnap 1977a,b, Barwise 1997).\nThese may consist, for instance, in sets of data supplied by different\nsources which are inconsistent with each other, such as incompatible\nevidence presented by different witnesses in a trial. Intuitively, we\nare allowed to draw the logical consequences of data fed in by a\nsingle source, but should not conjoin data from distinct\nsources which may be inconsistent with each other. The database is\n\u201ccompartmentalized\u201d: occasional inconsistencies are placed\nin separate sectors and should not be asserted conjunctively (see\ne.g., Belnap 1977a,b, Hyde 1997, Brown and Priest 2004). Impossible\nworlds are useful in such models\u2014particularly\nnon-adjunctive worlds, where a conjunction may be false even\nif both conjuncts are true. (We discuss such worlds further in\n section 5.2.)\n2.3 Fiction\n\nInconsistent information is at issue also in certain works of fiction.\nLewis\u2019s classic 1978 paper proposed an analysis of the\nexpression \u201ctrue in such-and-such fiction\u201d in terms of\npossible worlds. What holds in a certain fictional work is what holds\nat a set of possible worlds, properly selected via a series of (quite\nsubtle and complex) clauses. But fiction can be occasionally\ninconsistent. Sometimes, this happens unintentionally: Conan\nDoyle\u2019s The Sign of the Four describes Watson as\nlimping because of a war wound at his leg. In A Study in\nScarlet, however, Watson has no wound at his leg (for his wound\nis in his shoulder and he doesn\u2019t limp). One may claim that the\nset of worlds that make such stories true has to be split into\ndisjoint subsets, making true consistent fragments of the fiction.\nThis strategy won\u2019t always work, however, for inconsistencies in\nfiction may be intentional (as stressed in Proudfoot 2006). Suppose we\nwrite a novel, and in its first chapter we have the Mad Mathematician\nproduce a round square. If the intentional inconsistency is excised,\nthe fact that mathematicians all over the world are amazed by this\nresult in the second chapter becomes unexplainable. A natural\ntreatment of these cases, then, is obtained by admitting\n(appropriately selected) impossible worlds in the set of situations\nthat realize what is told in the story (see e.g. Priest 1997b; Woods\n2003, Chapter 6; Berto 2012, Chapters 7 and 8; Badura and Berto\n2019).\n2.4 Propositional Content\n\nClosely connected to belief is the notion of propositional\ncontent. Within possible worlds semantics,\n propositions\n can be defined as functions from worlds to truth values, or as sets\nof worlds: a proposition is the set of worlds at which it is true. The\naccount is notoriously too coarse-grained (Barwise 1997). Intuitively\ndistinct impossible propositions (that swans are blue and not blue;\nthat Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem is false; that Charles is a married\nbachelor) all hold at precisely no possible worlds. And we have a dual\nproblem with (unrestrictedly) necessary propositions, which are all\nidentified with the set of all possible worlds. Treating propositions\nas set-theoretic constructions out of possible worlds leads to a very\ncoarse individuation of propositions, and because of this it has been\nsubject to seemingly devastating attacks, for instance, by Scott\nSoames 1987. However, impossible worlds allow for fine-grained\ndistinctions unavailable in standard possible worlds semantics. An\nimpossible proposition need not be equated with the empty set of\nworlds, for it may be a set which includes (only) impossible worlds.\nWe can have an impossible world \\(w_1\\) with impossibly coloured\nswans, a distinct impossible world \\(w_2\\) at which Fermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem is false, and a further impossible world \\(w_3\\) at which\nbachelors are married (but at which swans and Diophantine equations\nbehave correctly). Ripley (2012) argues that an account along these\nlines is a better strategy for addressing the coarse-grainedness\nproblem than resorting to\n structured propositions.\n\nOne other application of impossible worlds concerns\nperceptual impossibilities. When we see an Escher drawing or\na Penrose triangle, our experience has content. But that content is\nimpossible: such structures cannot be realised. The content of our\nexperience in such cases is naturally captured using impossible\nworlds. Splitting that content into smaller internally consistent\nparts would lose the essential feature of the whole. This issue is\nexplored in Mortensen 1997.\n2.5 Counterpossible Reasoning\n\nPerhaps the most important application of impossible worlds has to do\nwith counterpossible reasoning, understood as counterfactual reasoning\nfrom impossible antecedents. As we saw in\n section 1,\n this kind of reasoning is often taken to provide independent\nmotivation for believing in impossible worlds. (For a recent overview\nof the literature on counterpossibles, see Kocurek 2021.) In\nLewis-Stalnaker theories of counterfactuals, a conditional of the\nform, \u201cif it were the case that \\(A\\), then it would be the case\nthat \\(B\\)\u201d is true if and only if, at the closest world (or\nclosest worlds) at which \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is also true. (This is a\nsimplification of the truth conditions provided in the full-fledged\nsemantics of Lewis 1973.)\n\nWhile the standard conditional logics based on this idea have been\nquite successful in the treatment of counterfactuals, the approach\nentails that any counterfactual whose antecedent is impossible is\nvacuously true. For if there are no possible worlds at which \\(A\\) is\ntrue, then trivially, all closest \\(A\\)-worlds (worlds where \\(A\\) is\ntrue) are \\(B\\)-worlds. This is unsatisfying in many respects, for we\noften need to reason nontrivially about theories that (perhaps\nunbeknownst to us) cannot possibly be correct; and we often need to\nreason from antecedents that may turn out to be not only false, but\nnecessarily so. (Compare the conditionals (1.1) and (1.2) in\n section 1\n for an example.) Recent defences of the view that counterpossibles\nare not all vacuously true include Send\u0142ak 2021 and McLoone\n2021.\n\nThree contexts in which theories of this kind show up are discourses\non (1) alternative logics, (2) mathematical conjectures, and (3)\nmetaphysical views. We will now say a few words on each of them.\n\n(1) A famous Quinean motto has it that \u201cto change the logic is\nto change the subject\u201d: apparently disagreeing logical parties\nare actually speaking of different things. So when intuitionists deny\nthat the Law of Excluded Middle holds in non-finitary contexts, they\nare actually changing the meaning of logical operators; when\nparaconsistentists claim that some formula can be true (in some weird\ncircumstances) together with its negation, they are not talking of\nnegation anymore (see e.g., Berto 2008).\n\nBut this does not make good sense of many disputes between\nintuitionists, classical logicians, paraconsistentists, quantum\nlogicians, etc. It is more fruitful to assume that each party\ngenerally understands the rival logics as intelligible, albeit\nnecessarily false, theories. Even if classical logic actually is the\none true logic, one can reason counterpossibly about what would be the\ncase if a certain non-classical logic were the correct one (e.g.,\n\u201cif intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law of Excluded\nMiddle would fail\u201d is true and \u201cif intuitionistic logic\nwere correct, then the Law of Explosion would fail\u201d is false).\nOne can take into account situations in which the Law of Excluded\nMiddle fails and argue about what would and would not be the case in\nthem. These situations are, by classical standards, just impossible\nworlds (of the third kind: Classical Logic Violators).\n\n(2) Similar claims can be made for mathematical conjectures. Different\nset theorists have different views on controversial subjects such as\nnon-well-founded sets, the\n Continuum Hypothesis,\n the Axiom of Choice, the set/(proper-)class distinction, etc. If one\nembraces the Platonic view (subscribed to, at least implicitly, by\nmany set theorists) that there is One True Universe of sets, then at\nmost one of the alternative set theories can be correct: the others\nare wrong, and necessarily so. But people can work under the\nhypothesis that a necessarily false basic mathematical principle\nholds, and reason coherently from this:\n\nIt is doubtless true that nothing sensible can be said about how\nthings would be different if there were no number 17; that is largely\nbecause the antecedent of this counterfactual gives us no hints as to\nwhat alternative mathematics is to be regarded as true in the\ncounterfactual situation in question. If one changes the example to\n\u201cNothing sensible can be said about how things would be\ndifferent if the axiom of choice were false\u201d, it seems wrong\n\u2026 : if the axiom of choice were false, the cardinals\nwouldn\u2019t be linearly ordered, the Banach-Tarski theorem would\nfail and so forth. (Field 1989: 237\u20138)\n\n\nField takes this as an argument to the effect that mathematical\nnecessity is not coextensive with logical necessity. But we can turn\nthe tables around: mathematical necessity is unrestricted and false\nmathematical theories are just impossible theories.\n\n(3) The third area in which counterpossible reasoning comes into play\nare metaphysical disputes (and more broadly, any philosophical dispute\nwhose subject matter is necessarily true or necessarily false). Much\nmetaphysical talk is made with our quantifiers \u201cwide\nopen\u201d, that is, aiming at stating truths about all that there\nwas, is, or could possibly be. This is evident in modal ontology, when\npeople advance a theory on the totality of worlds and on their nature.\nBut other metaphysical debates easily come to mind. Suppose a\nphilosopher wants to evaluate metaphysical theories which she\nconsiders wrong (say, in order to draw unpalatable consequences by way\nof criticism), such as Spinoza\u2019s monism or Hegel\u2019s\nmetaphysics of the Absolute. She must envisage situations where such\nmetaphysics are correct and wonder what would be the case according to\nthem: situations at which there is only one substance, or at which the\nAbsolute Geist necessarily shapes the teleological\ndevelopment of history. These situations will be, under the hypotheses\nwe have made, impossible worlds.\n\nCounterpossible reasoning may also show up in philosophical analyses\nof various kinds. For example, Boris Kment (2014) has proposed an\naccount of modal notions which grounds them in explanatory reasoning,\nin particular of the counterfactual kind. To account for non-trivial\ncounterpossibles, Kment uses impossible worlds taken as as collections\nof structured Russellian propositions.\n\nSemantic structures for counterfactual conditionals involving\nimpossible worlds were first introduced by Routley 1989, and have been\nproposed e.g. by Read 1995, Mares and Fuhrmann 1995, Mares 1997, Nolan\n1997, Brogaard and Salerno 2013, Bjerring 2014, Berto et al. 2018.\nMost of these are natural extensions of Lewis\u2019s 1973 semantics\nfor counterfactuals and capture several intuitions about\ncounterpossible reasoning. The main task for such theories consists in\naccounting for the concepts of closeness and qualitative similarity\nbetween worlds once impossible worlds enter the stage. How to\nfine-tune these notions is not a trivial matter (for an extensive\ndiscussion, see Vander Laan 2004; we will say more in\n section 4.2).\n\nNon-trivial treatments of counterpossibles require the failure of\nseveral logical principles which hold in the standard Lewis-Stalnaker\napproach to counterfactuals (Williamson 2007 chapter 5, Brogaard and\nSalerno 2013). (Williamson uses these failures to argue that\ncounterpossibles are always trivially true.) One important principle\nthat fails is the entailment from a strict conditional, \u201cif\n\\(A\\) then-strictly \\(B\\)\u201d, to the corresponding counterfactual,\n\u201cif it were the case that \\(A\\) then it would be the case that\n\\(B\\)\u201d. Normally, the former entails the latter. A strict\nconditional is true when all the (accessible) possible worlds where\nthe antecedent is true also make the consequent true. If all the\npossible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds, then in particular all the\nclosest possible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds. In an account which\nadmits impossible worlds, however, we can have closest impossible\nworlds where \\(A\\) obtains and \\(B\\) fails, making the counterpossible\nfalse even though the corresponding strict conditional is true.\n\nThe ensuing anarchy can be mitigated to some extent, e.g., by assuming\nwhat Nolan 1997 calls the Strangeness of Impossibility\nCondition (SIC): any possible world, however weird, should be\ncloser to any possible world \\(w\\) than any impossible world is to\n\\(w\\). Reality will be turned upside down before logical laws or\nmathematical truths abandon us. Then it is plausible that the\nLewis-Stalnaker principles will still hold whenever the relevant\nantecedent is possible. For then we will consider only the\nclosest antecedent-worlds when we evaluate the conditional, all of\nwhich will be possible worlds: the impossible ones will be too far\naway (Berto et al. 2018).\n3. The Metaphysics of Impossible Worlds\n\nSupporters of impossible worlds disagree over their metaphysical\nnature, just as supporters of possible worlds do. If one accepts\nontological commitment to worlds of any kind, then one faces the\nfollow-up question: just what are they, metaphysically speaking?\n\nThe two main options among modal realists (philosophers who\naccept possible worlds in their ontology) are David Lewis\u2019s\nextreme or genuine modal realism and\nersatzism (or actualism or abstractionism:\nthese terms all have slightly different connotations, which\nwe\u2019ll ignore here). It is a common thought among impossible\nworlds theorists that impossible worlds should just inherit the\nontological status of their possible mates: whatever your favorite\nmetaphysics of possible worlds is, impossible worlds are of the same\nkind. This has been called the Parity Thesis (see Rescher and\nBrandom 1980). As Graham Priest puts it:\n\nAs far as I can see, any of the main theories concerning the nature of\npossible worlds can be applied equally to impossible worlds: they are\nexistent nonactual entities; they are nonexistent objects; they are\nconstructions out of properties and other universals; they are just\ncertain sets of sentences. \u2026 There is, as far as I can see,\nabsolutely no cogent (in particular, non-question-begging) reason to\nsuppose that there is an ontological difference between\nmerely possible and impossible worlds. (Priest 1997b: 580\u20131)\n\n\nYagisawa\u2019s extended modal realism proposes a\nLewis-inspired realist account of impossible worlds and\nimpossibilia (the objects exemplifying absolute\nimpossibilities which inhabit impossible worlds). On this view,\nimpossible worlds are concrete mereological sums of real individuals,\nwhich are causally and spatiotemporally interrelated within each world\nbut never across worlds (see Yagisawa 1988). Yagisawa exploits the\n\u201cargument from ways\u201d we met above: if quantification on\nways the world might be or have been commits us to possible worlds,\nthen, by parity of reasoning, quantification on ways the world might\nnot be commits us to impossible worlds. The argument is backed by\nYagisawa\u2019s considerations on the additional logical and\nphilosophical applications allowed by impossible worlds, which are not\navailable, in his view, to traditional Lewisian modal realism.\nExtended modal realism is a strong position: concrete impossible\nworlds represent absolute and logical impossibilities directly, by\ninstantiating them. So impossibilities and, in particular,\nlogical inconsistencies, are \u201cout there\u201d in reality.\n\nIn his 2010 book, Yagisawa is more distant from Lewisian modal\nrealism. He still admits impossible worlds and impossibilia,\nand he rejects ersatz accounts of them. However, he now takes worlds\nto be points in modal space. Worlds are modal indices for truth, just\nlike times are temporal indices for it; and modal matters are treated\nin a way similar to how four-dimensionalist philosophers, who believe\nin\n temporal parts,\n treat temporal matters. According to four-dimensionalists, material\nobjects are like temporal worms extended across time: an object has a\nproperty at time \\(t\\) by having a temporal stage at time \\(t\\) which\nhas that property. Analogously, for Yagisawa an object has a modal\nproperty, a property at world \\(w\\), by having a modal stage at world\n\\(w\\) which has that property.\n\nMore moderate (Yagisawa would say: too moderate) realists\ntreat impossible worlds as ersatz constructions: abstract\nentities on a par with ersatz possible worlds (see e.g. Mares 1997,\nVander Laan 1997). Modal ersatzism comes in various shapes (Divers\n2002, Part III, is by far the best critical evaluation in the\nliterature). If one takes possible worlds as maximally consistent sets\nof propositions (as per Adams 1974), impossible worlds could be sets\nof propositions that are inconsistent and/or incomplete. Similarly,\nPlantingan ersatzism (possible worlds are particular states of\naffairs) or Stalnakerian ersatzism (possible worlds are world-natures\nor maximal properties) could be easily extended to accommodate\nimpossible worlds. All hands agree that such worlds come at no great\nontological or theoretical cost, once one has accepted ersatz possible\nworlds. After all, ersatz worlds are abstract: they account for\nimpossibilities, not by instantiating them as Lewisian worlds do, but\nby representing them in some way or other. Jago (2012) takes both\npossible and impossible worlds to be constructions out of positive and\nnegative facts, such as Barack Obama\u2019s not being French (see the\nentry on\n facts).\n\nThe extension of ersatzism from possible to impossible worlds appears\nto be particularly straightforward for linguistic ersatzism.\nOn this approach, possible worlds are world-books: sets of\nsentences of a special \u201cworldmaking\u201d language.\n(Carnap\u2019s (1947) state-descriptions and Jeffrey\u2019s (1983)\ncomplete consistent novels are examples of this strategy.) It is easy\nto admit impossible worlds of the same kind, that is, world-books\nwhich are locally inconsistent or incomplete, which fail to comply\nwith some logical law or to be closed under some notion or other of\nlogical consequence.\n\nHowever, there may be reasons to reject the Parity Thesis. If\nLewis\u2019s criticisms of ersatzism in On the Plurality of\nWorlds are right, then each ersatz account of impossible worlds\ninherits the limits of ersatz theories of possible worlds: each of\nthese theories has to resort to intensional entities taken as\nprimitive (such as propositions or states of affairs) in its\nexplanation of what ersatz worlds are, or to primitive modal notions\n(most often, to both). Suppose that, instead, one wants to retain the\nadvantages of both worlds (no pun intended), ersatz and genuine, when\nit comes to impossibilities. Suppose, that is, that (a) one wants to\nemploy a modal framework including both possible and impossible worlds\nto retain the theoretical benefits provided by the latter; and (b) one\nwants to stick to Lewis\u2019s project of a reductive account of\nintensional and modal notions to fully extensional ones\n(contra ersatzism); but also (c) one wants to avoid the\nunwelcome consequences of concrete impossible worlds instantiating\nimpossibilities, such as having true contradictions \u201cout\nthere\u201d in reality (contra Yagisawa\u2019s extended\nmodal realism). One could then try the following hybrid solution: (1)\ngo realist about possible worlds, and (2) exploit the set-theoretic\nmachinery of modal realism to represent different impossible worlds as\ndistinct ersatz, abstract constructions.\n\nTo fulfil these desiderata, Berto 2010 sketches an intermediate\naccount, labeled as Hybrid Modal Realism (HMR), which\ndispenses with the Parity Thesis. The account follows suggestions from\nDivers 2002, Chapter 5, and is similar to a strategy pursued in\nKiourti 2010, Chapter 3. On this view, genuine, concrete possible\nworlds are the basic stuff. Atomic propositions are taken as sets of\npossible worlds. Distinct impossible situations can then be\nrepresented by distinct world-books, taken as set-theoretic\nconstructions from atomic propositions. Krakauer 2013 gives a similar\naccount in terms of\n structured propositions\n built out of ordinary possible worlds. Jago 2012 and Send\u0142ak\n2015 criticise Berto\u2019s approach on the basis that it cannot\ndistinguish the proposition that Hesperus is the second planet\nfrom the sun from the proposition that Phosphorus is the\nsecond planet from the sun. Reinert 2018 attempts to do better by\ncombining Lewisian possible worlds with an ersatz situation-based\naccount of impossible worlds. Fouch\u00e9 2022 develops\nBerto\u2019s hybrid account into a full-fledged hyperintensional\ntheory of content.\n\nA metaphysical account of impossible worlds, alternative both to\nersatzism and to Lewisian realism, has been proposed in Zalta 1997.\nZalta\u2019s powerful theory of abstract objects is based upon his\nlogic of encoding, whose core idea consists in postulating an\nambiguity in the copula of predication: \u201c\\(x\\) is \\(P\\)\u201d\ncan mean that object \\(x\\) exemplifies property \\(P\\), as per ordinary\npredication; but it may also mean that \\(x\\) encodes \\(P\\),\nencoding being a special mode of predication. Abstract objects encode\nproperties, besides exemplifying them; in particular, they can encode\nproperties they do not exemplify (see Zalta 1983). Within this theory,\nsituations are defined as abstract objects that encode states\nof affairs (taken as 0-ary properties); and impossible worlds are\ntaken as maximal situations that are not possible, that is, such that\nit is not possible that all the states of affairs encoded by them\nsimultaneously obtain.\n\nZalta claims that, despite treating worlds as abstract objects, this\nis not an ersatz conception of worlds. A given state of affairs\n\\(p\\)\u2019s obtaining at world \\(w\\) (no matter whether \\(w\\) is\npossible or impossible) is analyzed as:\n\n(Z)  \\(w\\) encodes the\nproperty being-such-that-p, \n\n\nand so being-such-that-p is ascribed, in the encoding sense,\nto \\(w\\). As such, \\(w\\) is (in the encoding sense of the\ncopula, at least) such that \\(p\\). Thus, according to Zalta\u2019s\ntheory of encoding, worlds are in some sense metaphysically\ncharacterized or determined by such states of affairs. And according\nto Zalta nothing of the sort can be claimed of ersatz conceptions of\nworlds.\n\nAll the ontological accounts of impossible worlds presented so far are\nin a broad sense realist. They all accept that sentences referring to\nor quantifying over impossible worlds can be literally true, and take\nthe entailed ontological commitment at face value, although they\ndisagree with each other about the metaphysical status of worlds. A\ndeeply anti-realist alternative to modal metaphysics has also been\ndeveloped:\n modal fictionalism.\n The view is fictionalist (or anti-realist) about worlds. Its\nkey claim is that talk of and quantification over worlds ought to be\nunderstood as literally false: it is only true within a \u201cworlds\nfiction\u201d. We make-believe in the fiction because it delivers\nuseful results in the explanation of modal notions. Modal fictionalism\npromises the theoretical benefits of modal realism without the\nontological costs. We should not include worlds (other than the actual\nworld) in our ontological catalogue. But talking as if there\nwere worlds is useful. Gideon Rosen (1990), a major proponent of the\nview, takes Lewisian modal realism to be the relevant fiction. But it\nis relatively easy to extend such modal fictionalist accounts into\nfictional treatments of possible and impossible worlds,\ntaking e.g. Yagisawa\u2019s extended modal realism as the fiction\nwhich we make-believe. JC Beall (2008) proposes an approach to\nimpossible worlds (see\n section 5.1),\n which can be motivated by the idea that these are worlds where\n\u201clogical fictions\u201d take place.\n4. The Structure of Impossible Worlds\n\nAnother issue which theories of impossible worlds disagree on concerns\nthe amount of logical structure such worlds have. This issue\naffects impossible worlds specifically: there is no correlative issue\nconcerning possible worlds (beyond our choice of logic). Various\nclasses of impossible worlds display different degrees of anarchic\nlogical behavior: as we shall see, non-normal worlds for non-normal\nmodal logics\n (section 5.1),\n for instance, are such that only modal sentences behave in a\nnon-standard fashion at them, whereas sentences that include just the\nBoolean operators of classical logic get the standard treatment. Such\nworlds appear to be logically more structured than fully anarchic\n\u201copen\u201d worlds\n (section 5.3).\n For, we shall see, even principles of classical logic involving only\nthe extensional, truth-functional connectives can fail at open worlds:\ntheir openness consists in their not being closed under any\nnon-trivial logical consequence principle.\n\nShould we require impossible worlds to comply with any\nlogical rules? And if we allow different classes of impossible worlds,\neach exhibiting different degrees of logical structure, can these\nclasses be ordered in a meaningful way? This section focuses on these\ntwo issues.\n4.1 The Granularity Issue\n\nAre there any logical principles which impossible worlds must obey?\nMore precisely, is there any logical inference such that, for any\n(impossible) world \\(w\\), if the premises are all true according to\n\\(w\\), then so is the conclusion? There is at least one such\ninference: the trivial inference from \\(A\\) to \\(A\\). (For if \\(A\\) is\ntrue at world \\(w\\), then \\(A\\) is true at world \\(w\\)! An impossible\nworld may represent that it is not the case that A entails A;\nbut unless there are true contradictions, it cannot both represent and\nnot represent that A.) Are there any others? This is the\ngranularity issue.\n\nIn addressing the issue, a good starting place is the Nolan-Zalta\nPrinciple (Nolan 1997: 542; Zalta 1997: 647):\n\n(NZ)  If it is\nimpossible that \\(A\\), then there\u2019s an impossible world which\nrepresents that \\(A\\). \n\n\n(This is not an \u2018if and only if\u2019, since the converse is\nclearly false: some impossible world represents your reading this\narticle, yet that\u2019s not at all impossible. Impossible worlds\nrepresent possible and impossible situations. The things they\nrepresent make for an impossible bunch, but might each be possible\nwhen taken individually.)\n\nThe principle has some intuitive force. Nolan thinks of it as a kind\nof unrestricted \u2018comprehension principle\u2019 for\nimpossibilities. It tells something about which impossible worlds\nthere are. There will be worlds which represent that water is not\nH\\(_2\\)O, that \\(2+2=5\\), and that snow both is and is not white. One\nmight think that (NZ) entails that \u2018anything goes\u2019 with\nregard to impossible worlds: that any logical principle (except \\(A\n\\vDash A)\\) will be broken by some impossible world. If so, then (NZ)\ndelivers the open worlds mentioned above. However, to apply (NZ), we\nneed a single object-language sentence \\(A\\) which describes an\nimpossibility. Logical laws, by contrast, are stated as relationships\nbetween multiple object-language sentences. So it is not\nclear that (NZ) does its intended work.\n\nPriest (2016) adopts two principles that are similar to, but stronger\nthan, (NZ): \u2018everything holds at some worlds, and everything\nfails at some worlds\u2019 (Priest 2016, 5) and, for any distinct\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \u2018there are worlds where \\(A\\) holds and \\(B\\)\nfails\u2019 (Priest 2016, 7). More specifically, in our\nterminology:\n\n(4.1)  For any \\(A\\),\nthere is a world which represents that \\(A\\) and a world which does\nnot represent that \\(A\\).\n(4.2)  For any distinct\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there is a world which represents that \\(A\\) but does\nnot represent that \\(B\\).\n\n\nPriest calls these the \u2018primary directive\u2019 and\n\u2018secondary directive\u2019 on impossible worlds, respectively.\nThe latter implies the former, which in turn implies (NZ), but neither\nconverse holds.\n\nTo illustrate the extra power (4.2) gives us (over (4.1) and (NZ)),\nconsider Simplification, the inference from \\(A \\wedge B\\) to\n\\(A\\), or Disjunction Introduction, from \\(A\\) to \\(A \\vee\nB\\). (4.2) directly entails that there are worlds where these rules\nfail. So, if we find (4.2) plausible, we can infer that impossible\nworlds are not, in general, governed by standard\n paraconsistent logics.\n A paraconsistent logic is any one in which cont radictory\npremises \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) do not entail arbitrary conclusions. But\nstandardly, paraconsistent logics maintain the principle that\nconjunctions are true just in case both conjuncts are; disjunctions\nare true just in case at least one disjunct is; and double negations\n\\(\\neg \\neg A\\) are true just in case \\(A\\) is. If we accept (4.2),\nthen these relationships will break down in some impossible\nworlds.\n\nYet even with (4.2) in play, it doesn\u2019t follow that\n\u2018anything goes\u2019 with impossible worlds. No principle so\nfar entails that some impossible world breaks the Adjunction rule,\nfrom \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to \\(A \\wedge B\\), simply because 4.2\ndoesn\u2019t apply to inferences with multiple premises. (We discuss\nAdjunction-violating worlds further in\n section 5.2\n below.) To infer the \u2018anything goes\u2019 conclusion, that for\nany logically valid inference there is some impossible world that\nbreaks it, we\u2019ll need this principle:\n\n(NZ\\(^+\\)) If it is\nimpossible that \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) but not \\(B\\), then there\u2019s\nan impossible world which represents that \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) but not\n\\(B\\). \n\n\nHowever, we can hardly claim that we\u2019ve derived the\n\u2018anything goes\u2019 picture of impossible worlds from this\nprinciple, for it is, in effect, an explicit statement of that very\nview. Whilst the original (NZ) has a good deal of intuitive force,\nit\u2019s much harder to feel that way about (NZ\\(^+)\\).\n\nThere may be no completely general, intuitively motivated principle\n(along the lines of (NZ)) from which we can ascertain just how\nfine-grained impossible worlds should be. Nevertheless, there are\narguments which support the \u2018anything goes\u2019 picture, on\nwhich there exist open worlds (those closed under no valid inferences\nexcept \\(A \\vDash A)\\). We\u2019ll briefly consider three such\narguments.\n\nThe first is simple. If impossible worlds can break some logical rule,\nthen why can\u2019t they break all of them? Suppose we fix on\nstandard proof rules for the connectives. Each such rule is as closely\ntied to the meaning of the associated connective as the others are (to\ntheir associated connectives). Yet, as each logically impossible world\nbreaks at least one of those rules, what\u2019s to stop some other\nimpossible world from breaking any of the other rules? This argument\nhas some intuitive force, but is clearly far from conclusive.\n\nThe second argument is from epistemic states. When we consider\nreal-world finite and fallible epistemic agents, there seem to be no\nrules of the form: if someone believes \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\), then they\nmust believe (distinct) \\(B\\) (that\u2019s why the logical\nomniscience problem discussed in 2.3 is hard!). If we model their\nepistemic states in terms of worlds, then at least one of the worlds\nmust break the inference from \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) to \\(B.\\) So each\nlogical inference (except \\(A \\vDash A)\\) is broken by some world\n(Jago 2014a; Priest 2016).\n\nThe third argument is from counterpossible reasoning. Suppose, in a\nclass on alternative logics, we consider what would happen if Excluded\nMiddle \\((\\vDash A \\vee \\neg A)\\), Double-Negation Elimination \\((\\neg\n\\neg A \\vDash A)\\), or the Law of Explosion \\((A, \\neg A \\vDash B)\\)\nwere to fail. If classical logic is the one true logic, and logical\nnecessity is absolute, we\u2019re then reasoning counterpossibly. If\nwe want to analyse counterpossibles in general using impossible\nworlds, then we\u2019ll need worlds where these principles fail. But\nwe seem to be able to reason this way, non-trivially, for any kind of\nlogical principle, and so our analysis will require open worlds\n(Priest 2016).\n\nWhy have we spared \\(A \\vDash A\\) so far? Well, it seems that in order\nto break this, an impossible world would simultaneously have to\nrepresent that \\(A\\) and not represent that \\(A\\). Such a world would\nitself be an impossible object, one with inconsistent features. Since\nmost impossible worlds theorists maintain that impossible worlds\n(actually) exist and that actuality is not inconsistent, this position\nis ruled out. It is available to dialetheists and others who\nallow reality to have inconsistent features. There seems to be no\ntheoretical cost in requiring \\(A \\vDash A\\) to hold at all worlds\n(impossible or otherwise). Going back to epistemic states, for\nexample, we want to represent inconsistent beliefs, such as\nsomeone\u2019s believing both that \\(A\\) and that \\(\\neg A\\) at the\nsame time; but it would be a mistake to infer that she both believes\nand does not believe that \\(A\\).\n4.2 The Closeness of Impossible Worlds\n\nIf impossible worlds display different degrees of logical structure\n(or lack thereof), it may make sense to order them. A natural way to\ndo this is via an extension of the traditional \u201ccloseness\u201d\nrelations between possible worlds. How to spell out the ordering in\ndetail, though, is far from straightforward. Within standard\nconditional logics, and in the treatment of counterfactual\nconditionals in terms of possible worlds due to Robert Stalnaker\n(1968) and David Lewis (1973), worlds stand in similarity relations;\nand similarity comes in degrees. This is usually represented by having\neach possible world, \\(w\\), come with a system of\n\u201cspheres\u201d. If \\(W\\) is the set of all worlds, let \\(\\$\\)\nbe a function from worlds to sets of subsets of \\(W\\), so that \\(\\$w =\n\\{S_1, S_2 , \\ldots \\}\\), with \\(w \\in S_1 \\subseteq S_2 \\subseteq\n\\ldots = W\\). Worlds within a given sphere \\(S_i\\) are more similar to\n\\(w\\) than worlds outside it.\n\nIf we take the special case in which \\(w =\\) the actual world (call it\n\u201c@\u201d), we get a natural arrangement of possible worlds in a\nsystem of spheres that mirrors their degree of (dis)similarity with\nrespect to @, according to the different kinds of possibilities and\n(relative) impossibilities they represent. For instance, a world which\nis exactly like @, except that Franz wears a white t-shirt instead of\nthe black one he\u2019s actually wearing while writing these lines,\nis, intuitively, closer to @ than a world at which the laws of physics\nare turned upside down. Some people have a general, intuitive\ndepiction of such closeness relations, and set out a hierarchy of\nmodalities accordingly: possible worlds where the laws of physics are\ndifferent from ours are naturally seen as more eccentric than worlds\nwhere only biological, but not physical, laws are different; and these\nare more eccentric than possible worlds with minimal factual changes\nwith respect to @, such as the white t-shirt world.\n\nCan such a natural view be extended to impossible worlds? First, it is\nintuitive to claim that some impossible worlds are more similar to the\nactual world @ than others. For instance, the \u201cexplosion\u201d\nworld (call it \\(e)\\) at which everything is the case (every sentence\nis true) seems to be as far from @ as one can imagine, if one can\nactually imagine or conceive such an extremely absurd situation. Now,\npick the impossible world, \\(t\\), at which everything is as in @,\nexcept that Franz wears an impossible t-shirt which is white all over\nand black all over. Intuitively, \\(t\\) is closer to @ than \\(e\\).\n\nNext, some authors (e.g. Mares 1997) favor Nolan\u2019s SIC principle\n(introduced in\n section 2.5).\n This implies that any possible world is closer to @ than any\nimpossible world is to @. A system of spheres for impossible worlds\ncentered on @ will just extend the intuitive possible worlds spheres\ndescribed above, by adding further, larger spheres where worlds\noutside (logical, or more generally unrestricted) possibility stand.\nBut how are these latter to be internally ordered?\n\nOne very general option is the following. Even though we subscribe to\nsome unrestricted comprehension principle for impossible worlds, we\nmay admit that worlds where only the intensional operators, e.g., the\nbox and diamond of necessity and possibility, behave in a non-standard\nfashion are less deviant than worlds where also the extensional\noperators, like classical conjunction and disjunction, do. Let us call\nworlds of the former kind intensionally impossible and worlds\nof the latter kind extensionally impossible. This picture\n(inspired by Priest 2005, Chapter 1) has some intuitive force to\nrecommend it. Kripkean non-normal worlds, where only the behaviour of\nthe modal operators is non-standard (see\n section 5.1),\n are intuitively less deviant than open worlds, where all formulas may\nbehave arbitrarily. Generalizing, the view would entail arranging the\nrespective spheres in such a way that any intensionally impossible\nworld is closer to @ than any extensionally impossible one.\n\nThis very general ordering of impossibilities, albeit intuitive, may\nnot be fully satisfying. A general qualm concerns the SIC principle\nitself. For one may claim that, intuitively, some slightly deviant\nimpossible worlds may be more similar to the actual world @\nthan some possible but very weird worlds. For instance, the impossible\nworld \\(t\\) above, which is like @ except for Franz\u2019s wearing an\ninconsistent T-shirt, may look more familiar than a world which is\nlogically possible, but where the laws of physics are turned upside\ndown. Several authors (Nolan 1997, Vander Laan 2004, Bernstein 2016)\nhave proposed putative counterexamples to SIC along these lines.\n\nAlthough we cannot pursue this topic further within the limits of this\nentry, the discussion developed so far should show that the issue of\nthe structure, closeness, and ordering of impossible worlds is quite\nopen.\n5. The Logic(s) of Impossible Worlds\n\nThis section is a bit more technical than the others. None of the\nother sections presuppose this material.\n5.1 Impossible Worlds in Non-Normal Modal Logics\n\nPossible worlds semantics\n is celebrated for providing suitable interpretations for different\naxiomatic systems of\n modal logic,\n such as\n C.I. Lewis\u2019s\n systems \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\) (Lewis and Langford\n1931). In each model, sentences are evaluated as true or false\nrelative to a possible world. Modal sentences \\(\\Box A\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond A\\) (usually read as \u2018it is necessary that\n\\(A\\)\u2019 and \u2018it is possible that \\(A\\)\u2019,\nrespectively) are evaluated in terms of \\(A\\)\u2019s truth at all or\nsome of the accessible worlds. By placing various conditions\non the accessibility relation between worlds, different modal logics\ncan be accommodated. (Readers unfamiliar with modal logic are advised\nagain to read the entities on\n possible worlds\n and\n modal logic\n before going further in this section.)\n\nThis approach validates the Necessitation inference rule:\n\nIf \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(\\Box A\\). (In symbols: if \\(\\vDash A\\)\nthen \\(\\vDash \\Box A\\).)\n\nTo see why, suppose \\(A\\) is a logical truth. Then in any model, it is\ntrue at all possible worlds. So given any world \\(w\\) in an arbitrary\nmodel, \\(A\\) is true at all worlds accessible from \\(w\\), hence \\(\\Box\nA\\) is true at \\(w\\), and so \\(\\Box A\\) too is valid.\n\nLogics in which the Necessitation rule is valid are called normal\nmodal logics. But historically, not all of the modal logics of\ninterest are normal logics. C.I. Lewis\u2019s systems \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\)\nand \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) (Lewis and Langford 1931) are non-normal logics,\nfor example. These logics are weaker than normal modal\nlogics, in the sense that they support fewer valid inferences. To give\na worlds-based semantics for such logics, we need to look beyond\npossible worlds.\n\nIn 1965, Saul Kripke introduced a special kind of world, the\nnon-normal worlds, in order to provide semantics for\nnon-normal modal logics. Let us introduce some simple semantic\nmachinery for propositional modal logic. Take a non-normal\ninterpretation of a propositional modal language, \\(\\langle W, N, R,\nv\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds; \\(N\\) is a proper subset\nof \\(W\\), the set of normal worlds; \\(R\\) is a binary\naccessibility relation between worlds; and \\(v\\) is a valuation\nfunction assigning truth values to formulas at worlds:\n\u201c\\(v_w(A)\\)\u201d denotes the truth value of \\(A\\) at world\n\\(w\\). Worlds in \\(W - N\\) are the non-normal worlds. The truth\nconditions for the extensional logical vocabulary (negation,\nconjunction, disjunction, the material conditional) are given the\nusual way. The same holds for the modal operators of necessity\n\\(\\Box\\) and possibility \\(\\Diamond\\), but only at normal\nworlds. If \\(w\\) is non-normal, the truth conditions for the\nmodalizers go as follows: \n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_w (\\Box A) &= 0 \\\\\n v_w (\\Diamond A) &= 1 \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere 1 stands for true, 0 for false. At non-normal\nworlds, formulas of the form \u00a3\\(A\\), with \u00a3 a modal, are\nnot evaluated depending on the truth value of \\(A\\) at other\n(accessible) worlds, but get assigned their truth value directly: all\nbox-formulas are false and all diamond-formulas are true. In a sense,\nat non-normal worlds nothing is necessary, and anything is possible.\nThese worlds, however, are deviant only in this respect: their\nbehavior, as far as the extensional connectives are concerned, is\nquite regular.\n\nIn some (though not all) worlds semantics, logical validity and\nconsequence are defined relative to just the normal worlds.\nThe idea is that the normal worlds behave \u2018appropriately\u2019\nwith respect to the logic in question, whereas the non-normal worlds\ndo not. For example, \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is valid in\n\\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), but (by definition) it is false\nat the non-normal worlds. So we need to ignore the non-normal worlds\nwhen defining validity and consequence, which we do as follows:\n\n\\(A\\) is valid \\((\\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for all\nnormal worlds \\(w\\) in all models, \\(v_w (A) = 1\\).\n\nPremises \\(S\\) entail \\(A (S \\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for all\nnormal worlds \\(w\\) in all models: if \\(v_w (B) = 1\\) for all\npremises \\(B \\in\\) S, then \\(v_w (A) = 1\\).\n\nEven though we have ignored the non-normal worlds in this definition,\nthey still play a role in invalidating Necessitation. For take any\nclassical propositional tautology, say \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\). This holds\nat all worlds of all models, so \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at all\nnormal worlds and hence is valid. But \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at\nno non-normal world. Now suppose \\(w\\) is a normal world that has\naccess to any non-normal world. Then \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is\nfalse at \\(w\\) and so (since \\(w\\) is normal) \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\) is not valid. That\u2019s a counterexample to Necessitation.\n\nIn these semantics for non-normal modal logics such as \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\)\nand \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), the valuation function assigns the same truth\nvalue to all box formulas (false) and all diamond formulas (true) at\nnon-normal worlds. But we can do things differently. In\nCresswell\u2019s (1966) semantics for the modal system\nS0.5 (due to E.J. Lemmon 1957), sentences beginning\nwith a modality are assigned arbitrary truth values. The\nvaluation function \\(v\\) treats modal sentences as if they were atomic\nsentences. (Interpretations for \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) are\nthus special cases of the interpretations for S0.5.)\nThe idea of considering impossible (non-normal) worlds as worlds at\nwhich complex formulas are treated as atomic one is a popular one, as\nwe will see below.\n\nKripke introduced non-normal worlds as a technical device in order to\ntreat C.I. Lewis\u2019 non-normal modal logics; the question of the\ninterpretation of such structures (particularly, of the\nontological status of impossible worlds), then, makes perfect sense\n\u2014 and the answer is not straightforward, as have seen in\n section 3.\n5.2 Nonadjunctive and Nonprime Impossible Worlds\n\nIn 1980, Nicholas Rescher and Robert Brandom published The Logic\nof Inconsistency. A Study in Non-Standard Possible-Worlds Semantics\nand Ontology. They introduced a modal semantics including,\nbesides ordinary possible worlds (taken as maximally consistent\ncollections of states of affairs), also non-standard worlds that are\nlocally inconsistent (such that, for some \\(A\\), both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\nA\\) hold at them), and incomplete (such that for some \\(A\\), neither\n\\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold at them). These are obtained\ncombinatorially, via two recursive operations having standard worlds\nas their base, and called schematization \\((\\cap)\\) and\nsuperposition \\((\\cup)\\). Given two worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), a schematic world \\(w_1 \\cap w_2\\) is one at which all and\nonly the states of affairs obtain, which obtain both at \\(w_1\\) and at\n\\(w_2\\). Dually, a \u201csuperposed\u201d or inconsistent world\n\\(w_1 \\cup w_2\\) is one at which all and only the states of affairs\nobtain, which obtain at \\(w_1\\) or at \\(w_2\\). Rescher and\nBrandom\u2019s inconsistent-superposed worlds are, therefore,\nimpossible worlds of the fourth kind: Contradiction Realizers making\nboth \\(A\\) and its negation true, for some \\(A\\) (just superpose, for\ninstance, a possible world, \\(w_1\\), at which I am 1.70m tall, and\nanother possible world, \\(w_2\\), at which I am 1.90m tall).\n\nThe assignment of truth values at such worlds is not (obviously)\ncompositional with respect to conjunction. The standard semantic\nclause interprets the \u2018\\(\\wedge\\)\u2019 symbol using our world\n\u2018and\u2019:\n\n(S\\(\\wedge\\))  \\(v_w (A\n\\wedge B) = 1\\) if and only if \\(v_w (A) = 1\\) and \\(v_w (B) = 1\\)\n\n\n\nBut the right-to-left direction will have to go, if \\(w\\) is one of\nRescher and Brandom\u2019s impossible worlds. These worlds are\nnonadjunctive: they allow two sentences to be true even\nthough their conjunction is not true. (Adjunction is the\nprinciple that the truth of a conjunction follows from the truth of\nits conjuncts.) Rescher and Brandom\u2019s worlds can also be\nnonprime: a disjunction may hold at them even though neither\ndisjunct does. They may also make some \\(A\\) and its negation \\(\\neg\nA\\) both true. But the corresponding conjunction, \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\),\ndoesn\u2019t follow. These impossible worlds retain a certain amount\nof logical structure. They are closed under any classically valid,\nessentially single-premised inference (such as Disjunction\nIntroduction); but they are not closed under essentially\nmultiple-premised inferences (such as Adjunction).\n\nRescher and Brandom\u2019s approach falls in the nonadjunctive\ntradition (see Berto 2007, Chapter 6) of\n paraconsistent logics:\n a tradition started by Jaskowksi\u2019s discussive logic\n\\(\\mathbf{D}_2\\) (also labeled as \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) in the literature,\nJa\u015bkowski 1948), and based on the idea of rejecting or limiting\nthe Adjunction principle. Such an approach has been revived in works\nby Hyde (1997), and Varzi (1997 and 2004).\n5.3 Impossible Worlds in Epistemic Logic\n\nTo model a concept such as knowledge, we can use a modality\n\u2018\\(K\\)\u2019 for \u2018knows that\u2019, with semantics along\nthe lines of \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019, quantifying over all\nepistemically possible worlds: worlds which are ways things could be,\nfor all one knows, or given the information or evidence one has\navailable. This is epistemic modal logic. (See the entry on\n epistemic logic\n for background material.)\n\nThis approach has proved to be very useful. However, when\nepistemically possible worlds confirm to the rules of logically\npossible worlds, the following principle is valid:\n\n(Closure) If \\(KA\\) and \\(A\\) entails \\(B\\), then \\(KB\\)\n\nThis principle says that one knows all the logical consequences of the\nthings one knows. A special case of this principle says that all valid\nformulas are known:\n\n(Validity) If \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(KA\\)\n\nBut these principles seem false. You don\u2019t know all the logical\nand mathematical truths, and there are truths which follow from what\nyou know which you don\u2019t know. (You might be indifferent to\nthose truths; you might even disbelieve them.) This is the problem of\nlogical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic\n again). There is a rich literature on the problem (Alechina et al.\n2004, Duc 1997, Hintikka 1975, Jago 2014a,b, Rantala 1982a), including\nsome who defend these seemingly false principles (Stalnaker 1991,\n1999).\n\nExactly the same holds for belief (treated with a modality\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 along the lines of \u2018\\(K\\)\u2019). The modal\nepistemic approach tells us that, as well as believing all\nconsequences of what we believe, we must hold a perfectly consistent\nset of beliefs:\n\n(Consistency) \\(\\vDash \\neg(BA \\wedge B\\neg A)\\).\n\nThis is a hard principle to defend, as anyone who has reflected on\ntheir own beliefs will appreciate.\n\nA popular method of avoiding these principles (beginning with\nCresswell 1973 and Hintikka 1975) is to allow impossible worlds into\nthe account. Consider again Rescher and Brandom\u2019s nonadjunctive\nand nonprime worlds, at which conjunction and disjunction behave\nanarchically. Rantala (1982a) takes the idea further, introducing\nworlds at which any connective may behave anarchically.\n\nRantala\u2019s approach divides the worlds into normal and\nnon-normal ones. Normal worlds behave like possible worlds\nwhereas at non-normal worlds, every sentence is assigned an\narbitrary truth value. In effect, complex sentences \\(\\neg A, A \\vee\nB\\), and so on, are treated as if they were atomic sentences. The\ntruth value of \\(\\neg A\\) is independent of \\(A\\); the value of \\(A\n\\vee B\\) is independent of the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at a\nnon-normal world; and so on for the other complex sentences. These\nnon-normal worlds are thus a very anarchic form of impossible world.\nPriest (2005, 2016) calls them open worlds, since they are\nnot closed under any rule of inference (other than the trivial rule\nallowing one to infer \\(A\\) from \\(A\\); see also Jago 2014a).\n\nLogical consequence and validity are defined with respect to possible\n(normal) worlds only. Impossible worlds come into play only when\nevaluating knowledge claims, \\(KA\\). So, ignoring \\(K\\)-sentences, the\nlogic is classical. But the logic of \\(K\\)-sentences is not closed\nunder any non-trivial rule of inference, thereby dispensing with\nClosure, Validity, and (in the case of belief) Consistency. An agent\nis modelled as having inconsistent beliefs, for example, simply by\ntreating an impossible world where both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true\nas being epistemically accessible (from the actual world) for that\nagent.\n\nThe approach has been generalized to quantified modal logics (Rantala\n1982b) and developed into a unified framework for epistemic logics\n(Wansing 1989, 1990). Wansing has shown that various logics for\nknowledge and belief developed in Artificial Intelligence can find\nequivalent models in structures including impossible worlds. Further\nequivalence results in this area have been obtained in Sillari 2008,\nwhere it is shown that impossible worlds structures using binary\nepistemic accessibility relations are equivalent to structures using\nMontague-Scott neighborhood semantics.\n\nThis kind of approach faces problems, however. If there\u2019s no\nlogical structure to impossible worlds, then we might do as well to\nmodel an agent\u2019s knowledge using an arbitrary set of sentences,\nas in Konolige 1986. The worry is that unconstrained impossible worlds\nsemantics makes no real progress over this purely syntactic approach\n(Jago 2007, 2009).\n\nOne may instead adopt impossible worlds that retain some\nlogical structure, e.g., worlds closed under some\nweaker-than-classical logical consequence. One approach of this kind\nis found in Levesque 1984 (see also Cresswell 1973). This employs\nimpossible worlds of the kind used in paraconsistent relevant logics,\nwhich can be locally inconsistent and incomplete but are well-behaved\nwith respect to conjunction and disjunction, that is, they are\nadjunctive and prime. Laws of classical logic fail at them, and by\naccessing them a cognitive agent can have inconsistent beliefs.\nHowever, we still have a weakened form of logical omniscience: the\nbeliefs of an agent are closed under the weaker\nparaconsistent-relevant logic at issue. This seems incorrect as an\nattempt to model finite agents.\n\nRasmussen (2015) and Bjerring and Skipper (2019) present a\ndynamic impossible worlds solution to the logical omniscience\nproblem. Agents\u2019 beliefs evolve over time due to epistemic\nactions, on this approach (see the entry on\n dynamic epistemic logic\n for background). Bjerring and Skipper focus on deductive\nactions. Agents count as competent insofar as they unfold the\nconsequences of their beliefs, up to a certain depth of reasoning.\nTheir operator \u201c\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\)\u201d, says:\n\u201cAfter some \\(n\\)-step chain of logical reasoning, the agent\ncomes to know that \\(A\\)\u201d. The agent can update its epistemic\nstate by kicking out choices of impossible worlds which were epistemic\npossibilities before the deduction took place. One can show that if a\nformula \\(A\\) follows from formulas \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) in \\(n\\)\nsteps of reasoning, then \\(KA_1, \\ldots, KA_n\\) together entail\n\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\).\n\nImpossible worlds are starting to be used not only in formal, but also\nin mainstream and Bayesian epistemology. Modal accounts of knowledge\ninvoking possible worlds, whether based on the notion of\n safety\n or on that of\n sensitivity,\n make all necessary or logical truths trivially sensitive and safe.\nMelchior 2021 proposes to address the issue by using impossible\nworlds. Probabilistic-Bayesian accounts of credences or degrees of\nbelief can be formulated using logically possible worlds and sets\nthereof, to which probabilities are assigned by credence functions\nobeying the Kolmogorov axioms of probability. As noted by Pettigrew\n2021, this models logically omniscient, idealised agents who assign\nprobability 1 to all logical truths and never have higher credences in\nany given premises than in their logical consequences. To model\nrational but more realistic agents, Pettigrew introduces a setting\nsimilar to that Berto and Jago 2019 had for all-or-nothing beliefs. He\nresorts to \u201cpersonally possible worlds\u201d which make true\nwhat a rational but cognitively limited agent believes and has not\n(yet) ruled out using its bounded cognitive resources. Such worlds are\nin fact impossible worlds of the open kind.\n5.4 Impossible Worlds in Relevance Logic\n\nRelevance logic\n (or relevant logic) is an attempt to capture the idea that good\nreasoning requires a genuine condition between premises and\nconclusions. This should go beyond a mere guarantee of truth\npreservation. For when a conclusion \\(A\\) is guaranteed to be true\n(for example, when it is a logical truth), any argument\nconcluding in \\(A\\) will preserve truth from premises to conclusions.\nBut those premises may have no genuine connection whatsoever to what\n\\(A\\) is about. The same consideration applies when taking a\nconditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to be valid: there should be a genuine\nconnection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nWith this in mind, relevance logic attempts to avoid the\n\u2018fallacies of relevance\u2019 (also called \u2018paradoxes of\nthe material conditional\u2019). These are conditionals that are\nvalid in classical and modal logic, simply because the antecedent is a\nnecessary falsehood or the consequent is a necessary truth, but\nwithout a guarantee of any real connection between them. Examples\ninclude \\(A \\wedge \\neg A \\rightarrow B\\) (ex contradictione\nquodlibet, or the Law of Explosion), \\(A \\rightarrow B \\vee \\neg\nB\\), and \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow B)\\) (verum ex\nquolibet).\n\nContradiction-realizing impossible worlds can help us avoid ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, if they are worlds where some\ncontradiction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true but some other \\(B\\) is not\ntrue. For that reason, various systems of relevant logic have been\ngiven semantics which include (things naturally thought of as)\nimpossible worlds.\n\nA Routley-Meyer interpretation (see Routley and Routley 1972;\nRoutley and Meyer 1973, 1976; Routley 1979) for relevant\n(propositional) logics is a structure \\(\\langle W, N, R, {}^*,\nv\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds; \\(N\\) is a proper subset\nof \\(W\\) including the normal or possible worlds (the remaining worlds\nare the non-normal or impossible worlds); \\(R\\) is a ternary\naccessibility relation between worlds, and \\({}^*\\) (the Routley\nstar) is a function from worlds to worlds. \\({}^*\\) and \\(R\\)\nfigure prominently in the truth conditions for negation and the\n(relevant) conditional. Their task is precisely to provide a semantics\nfor negation that allows for the truth of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) at some\nworlds, and a semantics for the conditional that frees it from the\nfallacies of relevance.\n5.4.1 The Relevant Conditional\n\nIn order to get rid of such entailments as \\(A \\rightarrow (B\n\\rightarrow B)\\), we need some world at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B\n\\rightarrow B\\) fails. One way to achieve this may be to admit\n\u201cpartial\u201d or incomplete situations of the kind studied in\n situation semantics,\n at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails to hold, just\nbecause they carry no information about \\(B\\). Another way is via\nimpossible worlds: an understanding of such worlds, as we have seen,\nis as scenarios where logical laws may fail, and the Law of\n(propositional) Identity, stating that any formula entails itself, is\none of them. At possible worlds, we still require for the truth of\nconditionals \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) that at every accessible world where\n\\(A\\) holds, \\(B\\) holds, too. Consequently, \\(A \\rightarrow(B\n\\rightarrow B)\\) is not logically valid. Technically, when \\(w\\) is an\nimpossible world, we state the truth conditions for the conditional,\nby means of the ternary \\(R\\), as follows:\n\n(\\(\\rightarrow\\)) \n\\(v_w (A \\rightarrow B) =\\) true if and only if, for all\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that \\(Rww_1 w_2\\), if \\(v_{w1}(A) =\\)\ntrue, then \\(v_{w2}(B) =\\) true. \n\n\nThe key difference between \\((\\rightarrow)\\) and the standard modal\nclause for the strict conditional (which is true at a world if and\nonly if, at all accessible worlds where the antecedent is true, the\nconsequent is true), is that the worlds of the antecedent and the\nconsequent have been \u201csplit\u201d. Specifically, \\(B\n\\rightarrow B\\) fails at impossible worlds \\(w\\) when there are worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that R\\(ww_1 w_2, B\\) holds at the former,\nbut fails at the latter. Since we do not want \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) to\nfail at normal/possible worlds, we can add a Normality\nCondition, saying that the accessible worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\)\nare one and the same:\n\n(NC)  For normal worlds\n\\(w, Rww_1 w_2\\) only if \\(w_1 = w_2\\). \n\n\nUsing the ternary relation \\(R\\), one can build models for different\nrelevant logics. Starting with the basic relevant system\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), one obtains models for stronger logics such as\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\), the system of relevant implication, by adding\nadditional conditions on \\(R\\). (This is similar to the way we may\nmove on from basic modal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) to the systems\n\\(\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{S4}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), by adding extra\nconditions on the accessibility relation.) The constraints to be added\nto the ternary \\(R\\) are more complex than those of standard modal\nlogic and some involve the star operator \\({}^*\\) (which we\u2019ll\naddress shortly).\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to provide an intuitive reading for the ternary\nrelation \\(R\\). The basic idea is that the truth of an entailment \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) at a world \\(w\\) depends on \\(w\\)\u2019s\n\u201cseeing an accessibility\u201d (Bremer 2005: 67) between two\nother worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\), such that if \\(A\\) is true at the\nformer, \\(B\\) is true at the latter. But what does this mean? This is\nperhaps the most important philosophical issue facing semantics for\nrelevant logics. One approach is the information-based account of\nMares (2004, 2009, 2010) and Restall (1995), based on\n situation semantics.\n Another approach draws on various interpretations of\nconditionality, such as those found in the literature on\nconditional logics (Beall et al. 2012). (See the entry on\n relevance logic\n or Jago 2013c for further discussion.)\n5.4.2 The Routley Star\n\nGiven a world \\(w\\), the Routley star function outputs a world \\(w^*\\)\nwhich is, in a sense, its \u201creverse twin\u201d. The truth\nconditions for negation within the Routley-Meyer semantics are:\n\n(\\(\\neg\\))   \\(v_w\n(\\neg A) =\\) true if and only if \\(v_{w^*}(A) =\\)\nfalse. \n\n\nSo \\(\\neg A\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if and only if \\(A\\) is false,\nnot at \\(w\\) itself (as it happens with standard negation), but at its\ntwin \\(w^*\\). Relevant negation is therefore an intensional\noperator: in order to evaluate negated sentences at \\(w\\), we may need\nto check the goings on at some other world.\n\nAdding appropriate constraints provides this negation with many\nintuitive inferential features. If \\(w^{**} = w\\) for all worlds\n\\(w\\), for example, Double Negation introduction and elimination is\nvalid. This is often called De Morgan negation, for De\nMorgan\u2019s Laws hold of it. But it does not validate the Law of\nExplosion (that a contradiction entails any sentence). For a\ncounterexample, take a model where \\(A\\) holds at \\(w, B\\)\ndoesn\u2019t hold at \\(w\\), and \\(A\\) doesn\u2019t hold at \\(w^*\\).\nThen, both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold at \\(w\\), whereas \\(B\\)\ndoesn\u2019t: \\(w\\) is an inconsistent but non-trivial world.\n\nWhat is the intuitive connection between \\(w\\) and \\(w^*\\)? The idea\nis that the twins are \u201cmirror images one of the other reversing\n\u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019\u201d (Dunn 1986: 191). If\n\\(w\\) is \\(A\\)-inconsistent (both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold), then\n\\(w^*\\) is \\(A\\)-incomplete (neither \\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold), and\nvice versa. The \\({}^*\\) takes local inconsistency into local\nincompleteness and vice versa. It may also be the case that \\(w =\nw^*\\): the twins are in fact one. In that case, \\(w\\) must be a\nmaximal and consistent world, where negation behaves classically:\n\\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is false there.\n6. Objections to Impossible Worlds\n\nThis last section discusses some difficulties for impossible worlds\ntheories.\n6.1 The Exportation Principle\n\nSuppose that the expression \u2018at world \\(w\\)\u2019 works as a\nrestricting modifier: its main task consists in restricting the\nquantifiers within its scope to parts of \\(w\\) (Lewis 1986). If so,\nthen it should distribute through the truth-functional connectives.\nThis means in particular that \n\\[ \\text{At } w: (A \\wedge \\neg A) \\]\n\n\nwill entail the contradiction \n\\[ (\\text{At } w: A) \\wedge \\neg (\\text{at } w: A). \\]\n\n\nThis is the exportation principle. It is disastrous for any\ntheory of impossible worlds. It implies that an inconsistency at some\nimpossible world will spill over into an overt inconsistency. A true\ncontradiction at some \\(w\\) implies that there are true\ncontradictions, full stop. This is hard to swallow, unless one is a\ndialetheist. (And even\n dialethists\n may want to reject the exportation principle for impossible worlds:\nsee Jago 2013b.)\n\nAvoiding the exportation principle is not difficult, however (Kiourti\n2010, Chapter 4; Jago 2013b). For it to be valid, it seems to require\ngenuine worlds, as in Lewis\u2019s (1986) genuine modal realism or\nYagisawa\u2019s (1988, 2010) extended modal realism. Adopting an\nersatz conception of worlds blocks the principle. If a world\nrepresents that \\(A\\) (say, by containing a sentence or proposition\nexpressing that A), but is not in itself such that \\(A\\),\nthen the principle is blocked. \u2018At \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\)\u2019 will be interpreted as: \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or\nproposition) that A \\(\\wedge \\neg A\\), whereas \u2018at \\(w:\nA\\)\u2019 will mean that \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A, and \u2018not at \\(w: A\\)\u2019 will mean that\n\\(w\\) does not contain the sentence (or proposition) that A.\nBut an impossible world may contain both, or neither, of \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\), so that containing one implies nothing about containing\nthe other. An impossible world may (depending on how fine-grained we\ntake them to be) also contain the conjunction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\)\nindependently of whether it contains both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A.\\) So the\ninference from \u2018at \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg A)\\)\u2019 to \u2018(at\n\\(w: A) \\wedge \\neg\\)(at \\(w: A)\\)\u2019 is blocked (possibly twice\nover).\n\nIt is controversial whether any genuine account of worlds can block\nthe exportation principle. Jago 2013a,b argues not; Yagisawa 2015\nresponds in defence of genuine impossible worlds.\n6.2 Defining Possibility\n\nIf there are impossible worlds, then we cannot accept the simple\nclause for possibility:\n\n(P)   It is possible\nthat \\(A\\) if and only if there\u2019s a world \\(w\\) such that, at\n\\(w\\), \\(A\\). \n\n\nOnce impossible worlds enter the stage, (P) becomes false from right\nto left. We therefore need a principle that restricts the\nquantification in the right half of the biconditional to\npossible worlds. How to do that, without appealing to modal\nnotions, is not straightforward. A hybrid account (Berto 2010) can\nanswer the objection, by taking possible worlds to be all and only the\ngenuine ones, with impossible worlds as ersatz constructions of some\nkind. We can then capture the intent of (P) as:\n\n(P\\({}^*\\))  It is\npossible that \\(A\\) if and only if there\u2019s a genuine world \\(w\\)\nsuch that, at \\(w\\), \\(A\\). \n\n\nNote that it doesn\u2019t matter if the hybrid account accepts the\nexistence of ersatz possible worlds in addition to her genuine\npossible worlds: (P\\({}^*\\)) will still give the right result.\n\nThe ersatzist may respond by biting the bullet. Even without admitting\nimpossible worlds, most possible worlds accounts do not aim at\nproviding a reductive and complete analysis of modality.\n(Lewis\u2019s modal realism does. But it may not succeed, when\nso-called \u2018alien\u2019 properties, not instantiated by anything\nat the actual world nor obtainable as constructions out of actually\ninstantiated properties, enter the stage. See Divers 2002, Chapter 7;\nDivers and Melia 2002.)\n6.3 The Usefulness of Impossible Worlds\n\nStalnaker (1996) argues that, whilst there is nothing wrong in\nadmitting impossible worlds, not much explanatory work can be expected\nfrom them. For instance, if one takes worlds as sets of propositions,\none cannot then analyze propositions as sets of worlds. But an\nadvocate of impossible worlds may respond that the same point can be\nmade against any account of possible worlds (such as Adams\u2019s)\nthat takes them to be maximally consistent sets of propositions. And,\njust as ersatz possible worlds needn\u2019t be constructed in this\nway, nor need ersatz impossible worlds. Impossible worlds have found\nmany uses in the recent literature, as we have abundantly seen. So we\ndon\u2019t find Stalnaker\u2019s worry convincing.\n6.4 The Semantics of Negation\n\nThe standard semantic clause for negation has it that \\(\\neg A\\) is\ntrue if and only if \\(A\\) is not true. So there could not be worlds at\nwhich both or neither of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true, unless we\nrevise the semantics of negation. Stalnaker (1996) argues that\nnegation is such a basic operator, whose semantics is \u2018learned\nin a first logic class\u2019 that it had better be left alone.\n\nTo this, the impossible world theorist can reply that it is in fact\nthe case that \\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is not true; for\nthis concerns truth simpliciter, that is, truth at the actual\nworld. She may also agree that the same holds for any possible world.\nBut it is precisely impossible worlds that we are talking\nabout here; how negation works at any possible world need not be\naffected by the fact that, at some impossible world or other, some\nsentence can hold together with its negation: this is one of the\nthings that makes them impossible, after all.\n6.5 Counterpossible Reasoning\n\nTimothy Williamson (2007, Chapter 5) has objected to non-trivial\ntreatments of counterpossibles, in particular (though not perforce)\nwhen they resort to impossible worlds. Consider the claim:\n\nIf \\(5 + 7\\) were 13, then \\(5 + 6\\) would be 12.\n\n\nPrima facie, this is a non-trivially true counterpossible.\nHowever, Williamson argues, other non-trivial consequences of the\nsupposition would then be that \\(5 + 5 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 4 = 10\\), and\n\u2026 , and \\(0 = 1\\). Therefore,\n\nIf the number of answers I gave to a given question were 0, then\nthe number of answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nBut (2) is clearly false.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2007) pose a dilemma for Williamson: either we\nhold the context fixed in this kind of counterpossible reasoning, or\nwe don\u2019t. If we don\u2019t, then (2) does not follow from (1).\nIn particular, the context at which (2) comes out false is one at\nwhich the closest antecedent worlds are possible and, to be sure, at\nthose worlds, 0 is not 1. But if we hold the context fixed, then what\ndoes follow is just the following counterpossible:\n\nIf 0 were 1 and the number of right answers I gave were 0, then\nthe number of right answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nNow this is intuitively true, and non-trivially so.\n\nWilliamson (2007) also argues that non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles create opaque contexts, in which the substitutivity\nof co-referential terms fails. Supporters of non-trivial\ncounterpossibles will take the following conditional as false:\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Phosphorus would not\nhave been Phosphorus.\n\n\nGiven the necessity of identity, (4) is a counterpossible: as Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, its antecedent can only be true at impossible worlds.\nThat\u2019s false, supposedly, because even if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus had been distinct, Phosphorus would have remained\nself-identical. However, all accept that\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Hesperus would not have\nbeen Phosphorus\n\n\nsince it is an instance of \u2018if it had been that \\(A\\), then it\nwould have been that \\(A\\)\u2019. Yet substituting\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 for the first occurrence of\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 in the consequent of (5) gives (4). Since (5)\nis true and (4) is (supposedly) false, substitution of identicals has\nfailed. This failure of substitutivity, Williamson claims, is a bad\nresult, for counterfactuals should not create opaque\ncontexts.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013) accept that counterpossibles do create\nopaque contexts. They argue that the impossible worlds similarity\nsemantics for counterpossibles should be \u201cpartially\nepistemic\u201d (Brogaard and Salerno 2013: 654), and this epistemic\ncomponent explains the failure of substitution.\n\nAn alternative reply to Williamson is that the objection is\nquestion-begging. It is clearly false that counterfactuals allow\nsubstitution of identical terms (of arbitrary type). \u2018Had\nAristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nAristotle\u2019 is true, and Aristotle is the teacher of Alexander,\nyet \u2018had Aristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nthe teacher of Alexander\u2019 is clearly false. The substitution\nprinciple must (at the least) be restricted to rigid\ndesignators: terms that denote the same entity in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. But if the definition of\n\u2018rigid designator\u2019 is to be restricted to\npossible worlds, then the application of the corresponding\nsubstitution principle should likewise be restricted to contexts which\ndo not invoke impossible worlds. Viewed from this perspective, it is\nquestion-begging to insist at the outset that the substitution\nprinciple (for rigid designators) is valid for all counterfactuals\n(including counterpossibles).\n\nBerto et al. 2018 is an extensive discussion of a number of\nWilliamsonian objections to non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles.\n6.6 Compositionality\n\nCompositionality is the principle that the meaning or content\nof a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nconstituent expressions. It\u2019s commonly taken to be a mandatory\nfeature of any adequate theory of meaning and content. The argument is\nthat, as competent speakers of a language, we are in principle capable\nof grasping the meanings of a potentially infinite number of\nsentences. And since we\u2019ve learnt the meanings of a limited\nnumber of words, this is possible only if the meanings of complex\nsentences are obtainable recursively from the meanings of their\nconstituent parts (Davidson 1965).\n\nThe worry is that a theory of meaning or content which includes\nimpossible worlds will not be compositional. Consider what we said\nabove about the exportation principle (Section 6.1) and the semantics\nof negation (Section 6.4). An impossible world may represent that\n\\(\\neg A\\) independently of whether it represents that \\(A\\). But\nthen, for such worlds, the truth-value of \\(\\neg A\\) is not a function\nof the truth-value of \\(A\\). So, the worry goes, the content or\nproposition that \\(\\neg A\\), understood as a set of possible and\nimpossible worlds, will not be a function of the proposition that\n\\(A\\). Certainly, the latter is not the set-theoretic complement of\nthe former, as it is on the possible worlds account. The same goes for\nall the other logically complex sentences. This is perhaps the most\nserious objection to the impossible worlds approach. If it can\u2019t\nbe met, it may well be fatal.\n\nTo address the worry, defenders of impossible worlds must show that\ntheir notion of content is compositional, even if it does not provide\nuniform truth-conditions across all worlds. In other words, they must\nspecify a way to calculate complex contents from constituent contents,\nbut which does not go via the usual truth-at-a-world clauses for\nconnectives. As far as we know, the only attempt to achieve this is in\nBerto and Jago 2019, Chapter 8. They view contents as sets of\n(possible and impossible) worlds, which are themselves sets of\nsentences of some \u2018worldmaking\u2019 language. They argue that\ngrammatical structures can thus be recovered from semantic contents,\nvia the syntactic structure of the worldmaking sentences involved.\nThis provides a functional map between grammatical structure and\nsemantic content which in turn, they argue, provides a means for\ncalculating complex contents from their constituents. Whether this\nprovides an acceptable notion of compositionality (as they claim)\nremains to be seen.\n\nThe compositionally objection also appears in Williamson 2020, a book\nmostly devoted to a defense of the extensional material conditional as\ngiving the meaning of the indicative \u201cif\u201d, but also\ndealing with counterfactuals. Williamson accuses hyperintensional\napproaches to conditionals and to content in general \u2014 whether\nbased on impossible worlds, or of other kinds, e.g., based on\ntruthmakers \u2014 of \u201coverfitting\u201d: complicating the\nsemantics in order to account for the variability and systematic\ninconsistencies of speakers\u2019 judgments, with the result of\nincorporating \u201cnoise\u201d in their models. At the extreme of\nfine-graining, open impossible worlds approaches \u201cmust\nindividuate meanings so finely as to restrict synonymy to\nself-synonymy, and thereby render the conception of meaning\ntheoretically useless, because it filters nothing out\u201d\n(249).\n\nOf course, hyperintensionalists (with impossible worlds sympathies, or\nof other kind) may equally accuse extensional or merely intensional\nsemantics of \u201cunderfitting\u201d: conflating contents we may\nhave good reasons to keep distinct. We seem to need some principled\nway to mark the proper boundaries of semantics. Williamson proposes\none: we should pay more attention to a cognitive or epistemic level,\nintermediate between semantics and pragmatics. Many intuitive\ndistinctions hyperintensionalists try to force into the semantics are\nbetter explained as belonging to competent speakers\u2019\ncognitive-epistemic heuristics. He grants, for instance, that the view\nthat counterpossibles are not all trivially true speaks to our\nintuitions; but objects that \u201csometimes, the robustly shared\nverdicts of native speakers on a sample sentence will simply be false,\nthe predictable output of a fallible human heuristic.\u201d\n(265).\n\nSome authors, e.g. Rothschild (2021), argue that the Williamsonian\nstance is at odds with standard practice in semantics. The early\nchapters of any textbook introduction to semantics (e.g., Chierchia\nand McConnell-Ginet 1990; Heim and Kratzer 1997) tell us that one key\ntask of semantics is to account for (rather than explain away)\ncompetent speakers\u2019 intuitions and judgments of synonymy,\nantonymy, entailment, etc. Williamson\u2019s endorsement of the\nextensional material conditional gives, of course, a very simple\nsemantics for the indicative \u201cif\u201d; but, says Rothschild,\n\u201cthe simplicity comes at the cost of failing to integrate\nconditionals with the compositional semantics of natural\nlanguage\u201d (22). And once the heuristic procedures are developed\nin order to carry out the aforementioned key task, \u201cit is not\nclear that Williamson\u2019s overall system will still look\nsimple\u201d. (Ibid.)\n\nThe compositionally objection is also raised by Fine 2021, who\nproposes his truthmaker semantics as a hyperintensional account of\ncontent in place of possible and impossible worlds-based accounts.\nFine\u2019s semantics (2017a,b) uses states in place of\nworlds, where states are things that may fail to be maximal (making\nsome sentences neither true nor false), and they may be inconsistent.\nInconsistent states may be formed as mereological sums of consistent\nstates, e.g., summing the state in which the table is round with one\nin which it is square gives an impossible situation in which there is\na round square table. (To handle conjunction, Fine requires each set\nof states to have a mereological sum, so he is committed to\ninconsistent states like this.) Impossible worlds, too, may be\ninconsistent and incomplete. One live issue is thus whether truthmaker\nsemantics is a notational variant of a kind of impossible worlds\nsemantics, rather than an alternative to it. Ontologically, they seem\non a par and, in this sense, truthmaker semantics can be seen as a\nform of impossible worlds semantics. However, it is probably more\nappropriate to view truthmaker semantics as a rival to standard\nimpossible worlds accounts. Central to truthmaker semantics is the\nnotion of exact truthmaking, whereby the state in question is\nwholly relevant to the sentence\u2019s truth. Truthmaker semantics\nstakes its reputation on the utility of this notion, whereas standard\nimpossible worlds semantics does not.\n\nFine\u2019s approach is appealing with respect to the compositionally\nworry: it provides uniform clauses for the Boolean connectives at a\nstate, irrespective of whether the state is consistent. But the same\ncan be said of some impossible worlds semantics, e.g. the worlds\nsemantics for First Degree Entailment (FDE), a simple four-valued,\nparaconsistent logic (Dunn 1976, Belnap 1977a-b) which has been\nprovided with a worlds semantics including worlds where formulas can\nbe both true and false, or neither true nor false. But whether uniform\nclauses can be given for all operators is unclear. In Fine\u2019s\n2012 semantics for counterfactuals, for instance, counterfactuals may\nbe evaluated only with respect to possible worlds (which are, in\neffect, maximal possible states), with the consequence that embedded\ncounterfactuals are not permitted. It is currently unclear whether\nevaluation of counterfactuals at impossible states would require\nnon-uniform clauses.\n\nAnother compositionally-based worry concerns negation: are the\nnegations of equivalent sentences themselves equivalent? This will not\nbe the case in general within impossible worlds semantics. The\nsituation with truthmaker semantics is not straightforward: it holds\nin some but not all systems (e.g. not in Fine and Jago 2019).\nFine\u2019s response is not to banish those weaker systems, but to\nprefer certain systems for certain purposes. That response is also\nopen to friends of impossible worlds.\n\nUndoubtedly, other objections to impossible worlds can and are likely\nto be raised. The current debate on impossible worlds appears to be at\nthe same stage as the one on possible worlds was, some forty\nyears ago. At that time, people struggled to make sense of the concept\nof a possible world. Many declared it meaningless. Nowadays, the\nvariety of its applications has placed the notion firmly at the core\nof much philosophical and logical practice (see e.g., Divers 2002,\nChapter 4). Impossible worlds may undergo the same fate, should they\nprove as useful as they appear to be in the treatment of\nimpossibilities of various kinds.\n",
