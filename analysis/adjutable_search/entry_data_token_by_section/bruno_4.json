Though opposites, they were aspects of one\nand \u201cthe same principle\u201d (BOI I, 698; BOL I.2, 344) or\n\u201csupersubstantial substance\u201d (BOI I, 557). Since this\nsupersubstantial substance reconciled these and indeed all other\nopposites, it was a \u201cplenitude\u201d without a counterpart\n\u201cnon-being\u201d (BOL III, 40). To explain its unity, Bruno\nturned to Nicholas of Cusa\u2019s doctrine of the \u201ccoincidence\nof opposites\u201d. Universal Matter and Universal Soul/Intellect\ncoincided in an undifferentiated unity just as the circumference of an\ninfinite circle and an infinite straight line, though distinct\nentities, coincided. Not for nothing did Bruno acknowledge that\nNicholas\u2019s doctrine had provided him with the means for reviving\nthe ancient philosophy that had long been \u201cdefunct\u201d (BOL\nI.3, 272). This supersubstantial principle was the God of whom the\nEgyptians Hermes and Moses had spoken. During his trial Bruno asserted\nthat God had created all things from the two principles, \u201cthe\nWorld Soul and prime matter\u201d, from which all things derive.\n\u201cThey depend with respect to their whole being on God, and they\nare eternal\u201d (Firpo 2000, 381 [doc. 51, \u00a7252]). In his\nwritten works, too, he identified them with, respectively, the primordial darkness\nand light described in the first three verses of Genesis (BOL II.3,\n117). This was not as provocative as it might seem. Origen, St\nAugustine and many other theologians had identified God\u2019s first\ntwo creations on the First Day, \u201cheaven\u201d and\n\u201cearth\u201d, with, respectively, intellective beings\u2014the\nangels\u2014and matter.\n\nThis first principle and cause of all things, given its\nsupersubstantiality, was unknowable. We cannot understand God as we\ncan, say, abstract mathematical or metaphysical truths, let alone\nexperience him directly through our senses. Nevertheless, the\nuniverse, mere vestige of him though it is, teaches us a few\nincontrovertible truths. We know, first, that he exists. We can deduce\nthat a sculptor exists when we see a statue, even though we know\nnothing else about him. Similarly, we know from the existence of the\nuniverse that there must be a first principle and cause of all things,\nwhom we call God (BOI I, 646\u2013650). \u201cHe is who is\u201d\u2014a pun on\nGod\u2019s response to Moses\u2019s plea that he describe himself\n(Exodus 3:14)\u2014\u201cfor besides him nothing is\u201d\n(BOL III, 41; similarly BOL I.3, 26). Furthermore, since the universe\nis one, we can tell that God, too, is absolutely simple and the\n\u201cmonad of monads\u201d (BOL I.3, 144 , 146). He was the One\nBeing, the unchanging ens unum, of which Xenophanes and his\npupil Parmenides had spoken. All other things were his accidents or\ncontingent \u201cmodes\u201d (BOI I, 733), just as in arithmetic\nnumbers were composed of, and therefore accidents of, the number one,\nand physical objects were composed of, and therefore accidents of, the\natom. Even the substances Universal Soul and Universal Matter, given\nthey engaged in the flux of things, were accidents of God\u2019s\nsupersubstantial unity.\n\nTrue philosophers, those, that is, who understood that the universe\nwas infinite, could discover more than this. The numberless,\nmagnificent, blazing, celestial bodies revealed, to paraphrase Psalm\n19:1 (KJV), many things about \u201cthe infinite excellence and\nmajesty of their first principle and cause\u201d (BOI I,\n649\u2013650). Together they formed a \u201cpicture, book and mirror\nin which we could gaze upon, read and contemplate the vestige, law and\nsimulacrum\u201d of God (BOL I.1, 203; BOI II, 27). The first of these analogies,\nthat of painting, Bruno developed as follows. A masterpiece relied on\nusing appropriately a range of colours, not just \u201cgold and\nfinest purple\u201d (BOL I.1, 310, 312). Plotinus inspired the\nanalogy (Enneads, III.2.11), but Bruno, as ever, gave\nit a distinctive twist. For Plotinus, it illustrated how the hierarchical\narrangement of all things necessarily entailed a descent from perfect\nbeing to the absence of being, from the absolutely good to the\nnot-good. In Bruno\u2019s philosophy, no such hierarchy existed. Something\nabject was like a splodge of paint which, drab though it appeared on\nthe palette, once applied, lent a painting the desired effect (BOL\nI.1, 312). In other words, accidents that they all were, things\nacquired ontological significance only insofar as they were part of\nGod\u2019s \u201cperfect\u201d image, the universe. As such, the\nlatter was an epiphany incomparably more splendid and revelatory than\nthat proferred by any individual, whether \u201cEgyptian, Syrian,\nGreek or Roman\u201d (BOL I.1, 205). The Syrian that Bruno had in\nmind was Jesus Christ, who was born in Bethlehem and bought up in Nazareth,\nboth towns, as St Luke (2:2) mentioned in his account of the nativity,\nbeing located in what the Roman Empire at the time knew as Syria. It was the\nuniverse, not the first Adam or, as St Paul had called Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:45), the second Adam (Genesis 1:26; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Colossians 1:5; Hebrews 1:3), that was made in God\u2019s \u201cimage\u201d.\n\nCountless theologians and philosophers had proclaimed over the\ncenturies that the perceptible world announced the glory of God. Bruno\nturned the topos to advantage. Only a universe infinite in time\nand extent could fittingly embody what the Apostles\u2019 Creed\ndesignated as his primary attribute, omnipotence. In God and the\nuniverse all possibilities were actualized. Both were infinite and\n\u201call that can be\u201d (BOI I, 602). They differed in that,\nwhereas in the universe all possibilities were at any given moment\nactualized somewhere, in the supersubstantial being, in which form and\nmatter, being and existence, act and potentiality were\nundifferentiated, all possibilities were actualized absolutely without\ndistinctions of time and place. This argument contradicted two\nscholastic convictions: 1) that what was in act physically could not\nbe infinite since infinity was indeterminacy and that consequently an\ninfinite body in act, that is, an infinite universe and specifically\nan infinite animate universe, was an impossibility; and 2) that\nGod\u2019s absolute and ordained power were distinct, that there was,\nin other words, a distinction between: a) the unlimited possibilities,\napart from self-contradiction, available to God by virtue of his\nabsolute power; and b) the limited range of possibilities, that is,\nthose of a finite cosmos, that he freely chose to entertain in his\ndealings with creation (Granada 1994). These arguments, Bruno replied, besides being philosophically incoherent, belittled God\u2019s powers and so undermined \u201claws, religions, faith and morality\u201d (BOI II, 46)\n\nThese two modes of defining God, as the One Being and through his\naccidents, mirrored an important distinction in Bruno\u2019s\nmetaphysics. God had two aspects, one wholly aloof from the universe,\nthe other in communion with it. Precedents were the Neoplatonic\ndistinction between the One \u201cunparticipated\u201d and\n\u201cparticipated\u201d and the Christian distinction between\n\u201cGod hidden\u201d and \u201cGod manifest\u201d (BOI II, 43;\nBOL I.4, 79; III, 41; Isaiah 45:15; Romans 1:19\u201320). The\nChristian God, or more exactly the Word, remained unaltered even as he became miraculously\nincarnated as Jesus Christ. Similarly, Bruno\u2019s supersubstantial God\nproduced the universe, through his supernatural reconciliation of\nnecessity and free will (BOL I.1, 242\u2013247), as Christ-like and\nas his \u201conly begotten\u201d nature (BOI I, 693; BOL III,\n58\u201359; I John 4:9). Bruno used several analogies to clarify the\nrelationship, one of which derived from a passage in Plotinus (BOI I,\n731\u2013732; Plotinus, Enneads, II.6.1) clarifying the\nrelationship of the intelligible and sensible worlds. A single\nsperm\u2014here he followed a common belief\u2014was a complete\nhomunculus, a \u201csubstance\u201d, comprising virtually the arms,\nlegs and every other bodily attribute of a fully grown human being in\nan undifferentiated unity. This substance, this DNA so to speak,\nremained intact with the advent of the body, determining its\n\u201cqualities, differences, accidents and organization\u201d as it\ndeveloped, matured and decayed. Similarly, converting temporal into\nontological priority, the One Being, God, contained intrinsically the\nattributes of the universe in a virtual, unexplicated, mode and, while\nremaining undifferentiated in this mode, also determined in a second\nextrinsic, yet still undifferentiated, mode the differentiations of\nthe explicated universe.\n\nTo explain how God, in his external aspect, articulated these\ndifferentiations, Bruno used Platonic concepts and themes.\nFicino\u2019s Christian Platonism was especially influential. God\nwas a unity or undifferentiated plenitude of Ideas existing in him\nvirtually. In this sense he was Mind. Dependent on him as Mind were:\n(a) the discrete Ideas unified in the Universal Intellect (see\n Section 4); \nand (b) the vestiges of the Ideas, that\nis, forms, which, in combination with sensible matter, produced\ncorporeal things. Further, as Mind, he was also the supersubstantial\nprinciple of intelligence, contemplating the undifferentiated\nplenitude of Ideas within him in one timeless act. Dependent on him in\nthis respect were intelligences of various kinds: (a) the Universal\nIntellect, which contemplated the discrete Ideas simultaneously as a\nunity; (b) disembodied intelligences, known conventionally as\n\u201cseparate intelligences\u201d, which contemplated just one Idea\nabsolutely; (c) embodied intelligences, a category that included the\n\u201cprincipal bodies\u201d, which, though embodied, contemplated\nGod intellectively without the use of sense data and ratiocination,\ndemons and human beings, both of whom used sense data and reason to\nattain intellection, and all other animals, even the\nsimplest. Proof of this were animal instincts, as Ficino, too, had\nnoted. Instincts were the presence of God as Mind working within them\nrather than, as scholastics typically held, powers that the stars\ninstilled in them extraneously.\n\nBruno\u2019s next step was Presocratic rather than Platonic. All\ncognitive acts, in whatever animal or indeed separate intelligence,\nwere instantiations of a single cognitive power deriving from the\nUniversal Intellect and ultimately, therefore, from God as Mind. Bruno\ncited Presocratic philosophers to support this idea and related it to\nParmenides\u2019s concept of the One Being and the accidental nature\nof all things dependent on it. Two unconventional conclusions\nfollowed. First, the form that this single cognitive power took\ndepended on the bodily shape that it inhabited. For example,\ncontradicting Aristotle (On the Parts of Animals, IV.10,\n687a7\u201323), Bruno observed that the hands determined the kind of\nintelligence that human beings enjoyed. Second, no particular bodily\nshape, human, demonic or otherwise, was a privileged outlet for the\nexpression of the single cognitive power. Just as some animals had a\nbetter sense of smell or sight than others, so, too, some were more\nintelligent than others in certain respects. Ants were more\nintelligent than human beings in the way in which they organized their\ncommunal lives (BOL I.4, 119). By means of their individual cognitive powers all\nthings identified how best to preserve themselves and acted\naccordingly. Even supposedly inanimate things observed this principle\nand so showed traces of intelligence. \u201cWhatever exists in some\nway knows in some way\u201d (BOL I.4, 112, 118). A stone held aloft\nsought to return downwards to the earth because that was where it was\nin its optimal condition. It observed the law of gravity (see\n Section 3).\nCollectively the individual cognitive acts of the infinite number of\nthings were the means whereby the Universal Soul/Intellect bound the\nuniverse to its source, God. This impulse to adhere to him\u2014Love\non a cosmic scale\u2014ensured that the universe, having gone forth\nfrom God (his exitus), preserved themselves by their impulse to return to him (his\nreditus).\n\nBruno\u2019s Platonic interpretation of God\u2019s exitus\naccounts for his celebrated dictum \u201cNature is God in\nthings\u201d (BOI II, 354; BOL I.2, 151; I.4, 101). Nicholas of Cusa\nprobably inspired the formula. In a work that Bruno knew, Nicholas\nidentified Plato\u2019s World Soul with Aristotle\u2019s concept of\nNature, before concluding that \u201cthe World Soul or Nature was no\nless than God operating in all things\u201d (The Layman: On the\nMind, XIII.145). Bruno\u2019s comments on God and Nature\nindependently of the dictum agree with this sense. \u201cGod\ndetermined and ordered; Nature executed and produced\u201d (BOL I.3,\n136; similarly BOI II, 660). Nature was the Universal Soul/Intellect\nacting as the efficient cause (see\n Section 4)\n\u201cwithin natural things\u201d (BOI I, 598; BOL II.2, 176). It was the act\nof generation that \u201cdivided\u201d matter (BOI II, 147), operating within it non-discursively, unlike art, as Ficino (Platonic Theology, IV.1) had observed, which operated discursively on material from without (BOI I, 680\u2013682: BOL I.2, 312). The idea that plants and animals were the \u201cliving effects\nof Nature\u201d, that \u201cNature was God in things\u201d, had led\nthe ancient Egyptians to worship images of the gods in the form of\nanimals. Each living thing, in addition to its intrinsic being,\nincorporated something divine from the gods \u201caccording to its\ncapacity and measure\u201d (BOI II, 354\u2013355). The\n\u201cEgyptian\u201d inspiration for Bruno\u2019s comments in this\ninstance was a passage in Ficino\u2019s paraphrase of On the Mysteries of the Egyptians\n(VII.1-3) in which Iamblichus distinguished God as the cause of\ngeneration, Nature, from God in himself.\n\n\nThese and other Platonic borrowings sometimes obscure Bruno\u2019s\noverarching idea of God as the One Being in which two substances of\nequal ontological status, the Universal Intellect and Universal\nMatter, were reconciled. It was, however, only on sufferance that he\nengaged with Platonism. Repeatedly he suppressed Neoplatonic\ndistinctions between one ontological entity and another (BOI I,\n651\u2013653; BOL II.2, 178) or used them instrumentally rather than\nin the conviction that they were philosophically valid (BOL I.4,\n103). Philosophy must aim at \u201csimplicity\u201d (BOL I.3, 236);\nhence his contempt for Francesco Patrizi (1529\u201397), the most\neminent Platonist of the day (BOI I, 676\u2013677). All things were\naccidents of the One Being, intelligibilia included, and hence all\nthings engaged with matter in some respect. Accordingly he denied,\nwith a good dose of sarcasm, Platonism\u2019s central tenet: that the\nIdeas and the intelligences apprehending them were transcendent\nrealities (BOI I, 720-721; BOL I.2, 118, 304, 309\u2013313, 483). In what\nsense could they be outside an infinite universe? Not even the\nseparate intelligences were, in fact, separate absolutely. They\nconstantly illuminated us whether or not we were conscious that they\nwere doing so (BOL II.2, 173)\u2014hence the existence, for example,\nof instincts (BOI II, 455\u2013456). On these grounds, too, Bruno\ndiscounted the notion, in both its original medieval formulation (see\nthe illustration in\n Section 3) and the revised version proposed by the\nmysterious Renaissance thinker known as Marcello Palingenio Stellato\n(c. 1500\u2013c. 1543), that an empyrean\u2014an\n\u201cinfinite\u201d extent of intelligible light, devoid of all\nmaterial connotations\u2014 surrounded a finite, geocentric\ncosmos. Matter and form were inseparable (BOL I.2,\n303\u2013304). Abstract things, wholly separate from matter, were\n\u201cchimera\u201d, no more than logical fictions (BOL I.2, 257,\n309\u2013310). This led Bruno to speak, not of the Universal\nSoul/Intellect shaping Universal Matter, that is, of two distinct\nprinciples or causes, one active, the other passive, but of Universal\nMatter as having the forms inherent within it. To denote them as an\nintegrated unity, he sometimes used the term \u201cNature\u201d (BOL\nI.4,155; BOL III, 266\u2013267, 319). \u201cNature works within\nMatter, or rather it is Matter itself\u201d (BOL I.2, 312). It\ncontained \u201cthe origins of forms of all things within its womb,\nfrom which it brings forth and discharges all things\u201d (BOL III,\n694; also BOI I, 716\u2013717). The universe was like a\n\u201cgastropod\u201d, a living mass endlessly changing in\nconfiguration (BOL I.2, 313).\n\nWe arrive, then, at the intriguing conclusion that Nature, in this\nsecond sense, was God in his extrinsic aspect. \u201cNature is either\nGod or the divine virtue manifested in things themselves\u201d (BOL\nI.4, 101). Given, moreover, that God, despite having an inner and\nouter aspect, was one being, in some sense he must as a whole be\nwithin things. God was separate from us in one respect\nbut, \u201cas the nature of Nature\u201d, was \u201cmore\nintimate\u201d to His effects than Nature itself (BOI II,\n363; similarly BOL I.4, 73; III, 41). Or conversely, God was\n\u201cseparate from all things\u201d in the sense that \u201che was\npresent in them in a more exalted mode\u201d, not in the sense that he was\n\u201cabsent\u201d from them (BOL III, 51). Bruno was, as we have\n seen (see Section 4), wary of applying spatial\nmetaphors to intelligibilia, which were by definition\ndimensionless. Yet, like many a philosopher or theologian before him,\nhe was happy to use them when it suited. God or Mind or Nature was\nboth \u201coutside\u201d and \u201cwithin\u201d all things,\n\u201cabove\u201d them and \u201cbeneath\u201d them,\n\u201cextrinsic\u201d and \u201cintrinsic\u201d, and so forth (BOL I.2, 342;\nI.3, 147; III, 40\u201341, 509).\n\nThe question of whether Bruno\u2019s philosophy was pantheistic\npreoccupied nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars. Most\nconcluded, often ruefully, that his God remained theistic and\nretained, even if only minimally, an element of the transcendental.\nRegrettably, therefore, he could not be declared unequivocally the\nfounder of modern philosophy, the precursor of Spinoza and Hegel.\nDuring his trial Bruno himself, hoping to reassure his inquisitors,\nemphasized the theistic features of his philosophy. Divine Providence\nwas twofold. It was present in all things, animating them \u201cin\nthe manner that the soul was present in the body \u2026 and this I\ncall Nature, the shadow and vestige of the Divinity\u201d. It was\nalso in essence, existence and power \u201cin everything and above\neverything, not as a part, not as a soul, but in an inexplicable\nway\u201d (Firpo 2000, 67, 303). In his works, too, he emphasized\nthat God governed over all things providentially. Whether his\nphilosophy is pantheistic depends, needless to say, on how we define\nthe term. It shares with Stoicism, which is conventionally considered\npantheist, the view that there was a providential principle, God,\noperating within the universe, that was more than just the\nsum of its parts. Nor does Bruno\u2019s view differ radically from\nSpinoza\u2019s distinction between God as natura naturans\nand the universe as natura naturata, a distinction,\nincidentally, that Bruno knew in its original medieval formulation but\ndid not avail himself of (BOI I, 702). Indeed, it might be argued that\nBruno\u2019s philosophy is more authentically \u201cpantheist\u201d\nthan Spinoza\u2019s, given that the term implies that the cosmos or\nuniverse is divine. Bruno\u2019s philosophy, unlike Spinoza\u2019s\n(Nadler 2016, \u00a72.1), makes this claim in no uncertain terms. The universe\nas the embodiment of God was an object of awe, veneration and\naesthetic delight (BOI I, 453\u2013456; BOL I.1, 203).\n",
