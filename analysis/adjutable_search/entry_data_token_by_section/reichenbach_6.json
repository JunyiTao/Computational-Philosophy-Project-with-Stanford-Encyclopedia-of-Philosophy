    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics\n4. Philosophy of Physics\n\nAlmost exclusively, Reichenbach\u2019s scientific interest was in\nphysics. He regarded chemistry as an appendage, entirely reducible to\nphysics, and his only publication touching the subject is on Marcelin\nBertholot (Reichenbach, 1927a), the eminent French anti-vitalist\nchemist. Of biology, Reichenbach leaves open (at least in 1929) the\nserious possibility that life exhibits phenomena that cannot be\nexplained by physical laws, and of evolution he remarks that it has\ndisappointed in failing to explain \u201cthe problem of life\u201d\n(1929g, Section 2). He believed Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic theories\nwere scientifically warranted by Freud\u2019s evidence, and in Los\nAngeles maintained friendships in the psychoanalytic community,\nincluding attending and sometimes lecturing at the Psychoanalytic\nInstitute. As a student Reichenbach showed some interest in psychology\n(Padovani, 2008, p. 13), however, except for brief passages in\nExperience and Prediction (1938c), Reichenbach published\nnothing about psychology, and we have no evidence regarding how\nfamiliar he was with Freud\u2019s publications. It seems unlikely\nthat Reichenbach knew Freud\u2019s remarkably candid descriptions\nbefore 1900 of his aggressive data collection procedures, and of\ncourse Freud\u2019s letters to Wilhelm Fleiss (Masson, 1986), which\nreveal how little Freud thought of his own methodology, were unknown\nto Reichenbach. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s most original work on the foundations of physics\nis in three books, Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity\n(1924h), Philosophical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\n(1944b), and The Direction of Time (1956b). The first\nattempts an empiricist aufbau of the special and (in less detail)\ngeneral theories of relativity from experimentally accessible causal\nrelationships; the second essays a novel 3-valued logic for quantum\ntheory; and the third addresses a long standing problem in physics and\nmetaphysics. The Philosophy of Space and Time (1928h),\nReichenbach\u2019s most widely read, most elegant, and least original\nwork on physics, combines an extension to spacetime theories of\nHelmholtz\u2019s and Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism about\ngeometry with a description of Einstein\u2019s special and general\nrelativity theories from the point of view of the\nAxiomatization, much of which it repeats. \n",
