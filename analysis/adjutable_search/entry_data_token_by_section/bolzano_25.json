Philosophy of Religion and Theology\n\nIn questions concerning the science of religion and theology, Bolzano\nexhibited views with which he was in part far ahead of his time and\nwhich sound very current at present. It is no wonder that he\nencountered rejection and resistance on certain points in which his\ndeparture from the church doctrine at that time was too great.\n\nBolzano\u2019s main work in theology is his four volume Textbook\nof the Science of Religion, which was published in 1834 by his\npupils \u2014 without any mention of the author \u2014 from their\nvery deficient lecture notes (much to Bolzano\u2019s displeasure).\nWhat is meant by \u2018science of religion\u2019 (also\n\u2018philosophy of religion\u2019 or \u2018philosophical doctrine\nof religion\u2019), according to Bolzano, is the \u201cscience of\nthe most perfect religion\u201d (RW I, 3). Here Bolzano presupposes a\nconcept of religion that is, to be sure, interesting, but not\nunproblematic from the Catholic standpoint. Bolzano starts with\nreligion in the subjective sense, i.e., the religion of a person; this\nis, according to Bolzano, the set of religious opinions of this\nperson. The content or \u201cmaterial\u201d (Stoff) of a\nreligion in the subjective sense is a religion in the objective sense.\nThus, a religion in the objective sense is a set of propositions which\ncan be grasped (in the sense of \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) as explained in section\n4.1) by a religion in the subjective sense. Bolzano\u2019s concept of\nreligion is consequently based on his definition of religious\npropositions or religious opinions: A proposition (and analogously\nalso a subjective proposition or a judgment, an opinion etc.) is on\nBolzano\u2019s view religious iff it is both (generally)\nimportant and moral. A proposition is (generally) important\niff it generally exerts influence on our virtue and happiness (RW I,\n51 f.); and a proposition is moral iff \u201cthere is in the\nnature of man a reason for the temptation, without being justified in\nthis, to acknowledge it either as true or as false\u201d (RW I, 58).\nThus, as a summary of Bolzano\u2019s definition of the concept of\nreligion in the subjective sense, the following may be stated: The\nreligion of a person is \u201cthe collection of all those opinions of\nthis person which manifest either an advantageous or a disadvantageous\ninfluence on his virtue or his happiness and are at the same time such\nthat there was a special temptation, without any sufficient reason, to\ndecide either in favor of or against them\u201d (RW I, 60 f.).\n\nClosely connected with this concept of religion is Bolzano\u2019s\nview that many doctrines of the Christian religion, e.g. the doctrine\nof the descent of all human beings from a single parental couple or\nthe doctrine of original sin, are only metaphorical in character.\nOriginal sin is for him not real sin, but rather it bears\nthis name only insofar as it has its origin in Adam\u2019s sin and\ninsofar as it displeases God (RW IV, 47 f.). As regards the question\nof descent, what is of importance in this doctrine is not its truth\nbut only that all human beings are essentially equal in such\na way as if they had descended from one and the same parental couple,\nwhereas it does not matter whether they are also really descendent\nfrom only a single couple (RW IV, 17). The image of the common descent\nof all human beings is, independently of its truth content, very\nimportant \u201cin order to maintain the sentiments of brotherly love\namong us\u201d (RW IV, 18).\n\nHere Bolzano\u2019s non-cognitivist (i.e., emotive and directive)\ninterpretation of religious language is especially clear. This\nconception goes back to the key experience in his religious\ndevelopment, whereby he was able to overcome his religious doubts, and\nwhich essentially influenced his decision to become a priest: From\nMarian Mika, his professor in pastoral theology, he came to the\nconviction that a religious doctrine is justified, independently of\nits truth content, only insofar as the belief in it is morally\nadvantageous.\n\nA question in regard to which Bolzano adopted an especially\ninteresting position was the problem of miracles. According to the\ntraditional view, they are supernatural events or even immediate\neffects of God. Sometimes this is understood in the sense that\nmiracles are events which are not explainable by means of the laws of\nnature or even incompatible with these laws. This view, however, has\nto face serious problems as Bolzano has painfully made clear (cf. RW\nI, 422\u2013439, especially 424\u2013436). Bolzano rejects these\ndefinitions mainly for the following reason: \u201cIf by the laws of\nnature one here meant laws a priori, no divergence from them\nwould be possible; if, by contrast, one meant empirical laws of\nnature, a departure from these is nothing but what has been called an\nunusual occurrence\u201d (RW I, 436). Being an\n\u201cunusual occurrence\u201d is on Bolzano\u2019s own view a\nnecessary (though not a sufficient) characteristic of a miracle (RW I,\n437). An unusual event, however, is simply an event that is improbable\n(RW II, 68), hence an event whose intrinsic probability is \\(\\lt\n\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) (Bolzano 1838, 383). It can happen, however, that in\nevery possible explanation for a fact certain unusual events would\nhave to be presupposed, and that in such a case the assumption of a\nmiracle, of which we receive a report, is the least improbable and\nconsequently the most probable explanation (RW II, 69). Such\ncircumstances do not, however, detract from the divinity of miracles\nand revelation but rather can have certain advantages, for these\nmiracles thus become credible (RW I, 441 f.).\n\nA careful treatment of this problem therefore requires bringing into\nplay considerations of probability theory. This makes understandable\nwhat could otherwise be seen as very strange for a theological\ntextbook: Bolzano\u2019s Textbook of the Science of Religion\ncontains a section on mathematical probability theory (RW II, 39 ff.).\nHowever, also the choice of certain examples and the focus on certain\nmethodological questions in The Theory of Science can better\nbe understood if one sees that they are theologically motivated. Quite\ninteresting in this respect are Bolzano\u2019s investigations into\nthe discovery and credibility of testimonies and into the degree of\ncredibility of a proposition with respect to testimonies that are in\nfavor of it as well as of testimonies against it (WL III,\n555\u2013568); he used these investigations as a basis for his theory\nof the divine revelation. The special treatment of proofs,\n\u201cwhich are only to show that the probability of a proposition\nexceeds a given magnitude\u201d (WL IV, 294\u2013296), is closely\nconnected with the topic of miracles: In order to prove that an event\n\\(E\\) is an unusual event and thus qualifies to be a miracle, one must\ndemonstrate that the intrinsic probability of the assumption that\n\\(E\\) has not occurred is \\(\\gt \\bfrac{1}{2}\\) and therefore exceeds a\ncertain magnitude. The specification of a particular degree of\nprobability, however, is not required for this. Bolzano\u2019s\ndigression into probability theory in his Textbook of the Science\nof Religion and his careful use of probability theory in the\ndiscussion of miracles are obviously directed towards arguments\nbrought forward by David Hume, although Bolzano does not mention his\nname in this context.\n\nTwo questions discussed during Bolzano\u2019s time and once again\ntopical at present are those concerning the indissolubility of\nmarriage and concerning celibacy. Bolzano advocated the\nindissolubility of marriage without restrictions or\nexceptions (RW IV, 356 ff.). This, however, is not an article of faith\nbut merely a disciplinary prescription of the Catholic Church that is\nsubject to change, as he points out in other writings (Bolzano 1813,\n221, Bolzano 1845, 98, 374). This view even allows in certain cases,\ne.g., in the case of demonstrated adultery, the annulment of a\nmarriage (Bolzano 1845, 98, 374, Bolzano 1932, 101). Bolzano\u2019s\nposition regarding celibacy bore the stamp of his own\nexperience which he quite openly depicts in his autobiography (Bolzano\n1836, 25). While Bolzano earlier (in RW IV, 371, 388 f.) expressed\nhimself cautiously concerning celibacy (that he has not yet adopted a\ndefinitive opinion about it), he later explicitly favors the\nelimination of celibacy (in Bolzano 1845, 93 f., 258, 367) and\ndeclares celibacy to be \u201charmful and inappropriate\u201d (cf.\nFesl\u2019s note in Bolzano 1836, 94 f.).\n",
