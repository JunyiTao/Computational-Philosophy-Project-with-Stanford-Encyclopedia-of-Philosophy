    "main_text": "Evaluation as Essential to Action\n6. Prospects and Outstanding Issues\n\nThe turn to action theory is producing some of the most interesting\nrecent work on practical reasoning. As we have seen, however, their\nshared methodology notwithstanding, these theorists disagree on just\nabout everything else: on their philosophical reasons for adopting the\napproach in the first place, on what the correct theory of practical\nreasoning is, on why one form or another of practical inference is\nnonoptional or binding, and on what the upshots are for morality or\nethics. However, as awareness of the shared agenda grows, we are\nstarting to see positions that attempt to take on board elements from\nmore than one of the theories currently in play and, in addition, take\nup the task of explaining why competitors are misguided.\n\nThe primary source of the disagreements just mentioned is a further\ndisagreement, as to what it takes to count as an action. On\none view, intentional actions are centrally characterized by their\nstepwise or nested internal structure; on another, by their being\nauthored or owned; on the third, by their location in a practice; on a\nfourth, by entailing an evaluation of one\u2019s reasons.  (In one\nvariant, we saw, those evaluations are entailed by \u2018dialectical\nactivity\u2019, contrasted with mere action, and characterized by\nongoing reconsideration of its point and nature.)  As we have seen,\nsome of these characterizations come with supporting arguments, and\nthis is a dramatic advance on the state of play as of about two\ndecades back; however, the norm in this subfield is still to omit\nexplanations of why arguments for competing conceptions of action are\nincorrect. In a famous essay that kicked off discussion of a different\ntopic in practical reasoning, Robert Nozick observed that advocates of\nthe alternative responses to Newcomb\u2019s Problem were prepared to\nexplain why they thought their own position correct, but not what was\nwrong with arguments for the other alternative; such a posture is\nunsatisfactory, and Nozick emphasized that in such debates \u2018it\nwill not do to rest content with one\u2019s belief ... nor will it do\nto just repeat one of the arguments, loudly and slowly\u2019 (Nozick\n1997, p. 48).\n\nIt follows that the most important item on the agenda of this research\nprogram is to produce arguments that will decide between the competing\nconceptions of action in play. One can\u2019t very well hang one\u2019s theory\nof practical reasoning, and one\u2019s moral theory to boot, off an account\nof action that is treated as obviously false by other researchers in\none\u2019s discipline, when one has no story to tell about why one\u2019s own\naccount is correct, and theirs is not. We may conclude by observing\nthat there are two modes of argument one must choose between. One\nmight try to establish that, as a matter of metaphysical fact, actions\nare as this or that theory says; alternatively, one might\nargue that one is to (ought to, had better) produce actions\nwhich are as the theory says; that is, the top-level argumentation\nmight be either theoretical or practical. \n\nThe choice between the two modes of argument is tied to a further\nstrategic choice. On the approach we are examining, theories of\npractical inference inherit their bindingness from the non-optionality\nof the associated conception of action. That entails that any such\ntheory needs an answer to the question, \u2018Given what is meant by\n\u201caction\u201d, why not produce activity of some other\nkind?\u2019 To quickly canvass the forms this question takes for the\ntheories we have on the table: Why shouldn\u2019t I look for noncalculative\ncontrol structures, and manage my activity by using them?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with answering the question, \u2018Did you really\ndo (i.e., author) that?\u2019 with, \u2018Well, no, it just\nkind of happened?\u2019 What\u2019s wrong with engaging in activities that\ncompete with each other or frustrate themselves \u2013 that is, with\nbehaving as though you were a market on the inside, rather than a\ntotalitarian state? Why shouldn\u2019t I opt out of the game of Intendo, in\nsomething like the way I might decline a round of pinochle? (And if\nit\u2019s simply not possible, how is it that I have to cope with people\nwho seem to have opted out themselves?) Why bother with evaluating the\nreasons for my action? Isn\u2019t the fact that I am responsive to them\nenough?   Why not detour around activities with the structure\nof friendship, philosophizing, and conversation?   Isn\u2019t, say, harvesting\nan ongoing stream of sensual pleasures quite enough?\nNotice that we should not assume without argument that one or\nanother mode of action must be nonoptional; if the pressures toward\none or another form of action amount to less than practical necessity,\npluralism about action might be the appropriate conclusion (Millgram\n2010). \n\nA theoretical answer would involve showing that there is nothing else\nthat you can \u2013 metaphysically \u2013 do: that whatever\nyou do (in the thinnest possible sense) is action (in the theory\u2019s\nthicker and more substantive sense). A practical answer would involve\nshowing that, given the alternatives, the suggestion that you produce\nactions (in the substantive sense of one\u2019s favored theory) is, as they\nused to say, an offer you can\u2019t refuse. The type of force or\nbindingness that one\u2019s theory of practical reason will inherit from\none\u2019s theory of action will be determined by the choice between these\ntwo modes of argument.\n",
