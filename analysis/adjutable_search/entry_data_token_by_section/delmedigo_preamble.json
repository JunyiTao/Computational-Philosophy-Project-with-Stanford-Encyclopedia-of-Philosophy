    "main_text": "\n\nElijah Del Medigo is a unique figure in the history of western\nphilosophy. In the realm of Jewish thought he is mostly remembered for\nBe\u1e25inat ha-Dat (Examination of\nReligion)\u2014a work which discusses the role and function of\nphilosophical discourse within the Jewish-religious sphere. Yet Del\nMedigo also played a central role in the development of the Averroist\ntradition in the Latin west: translating works by and composing\ncommentaries on the works of Averroes, at the request of his Christian\nassociates and patrons in the last quarter of the fifteenth century.\nIn order to fully appreciate the nature of Del Medigo\u2019s\ncontribution it is therefore necessary to evaluate both aspects of his\nthought, within the context of its background: the Jewish community in\nCandia where Del Medigo received his initial formation, and the\nChristian intellectual circles of northern Italy, where Del Medigo\nspent most of his professional career.\n",
