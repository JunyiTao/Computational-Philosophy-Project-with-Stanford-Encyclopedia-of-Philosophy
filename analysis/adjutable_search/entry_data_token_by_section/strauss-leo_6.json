    "main_text": "The Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns\n7. The Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns\n\nAnother recurrent theme in Strauss\u2019s work is what he calls\n\u201cthe quarrel between the ancients and the moderns.\u201d Most\nspecifically, the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns for\nStrauss is about the excesses of modern claims for the authoritative\nclaims of reason and the philosophical moderation of the ancients. As\nwe saw above, according to Strauss, the trajectory of modern\nphilosophy\u2019s demise begins with the belief that modern\nphilosophy has refuted revelation once and for all. This false belief\nis based on an overreaching view of what philosophical reason alone\ncan accomplish and it leads to the equally false belief that there are\nno rational standards because reason is always imbedded within and\ndetermined by history. Strauss contrasts Socrates\u2019 moderation\nwith the excess of modern philosophers. Socrates\u2019 moderation is\nnot merely a political concession, according to Strauss, but bears\nupon the question of how we come to truth: \u201cSocrates implied\nthat disregarding the opinions about the nature of things would amount\nto abandoning the most important access to reality which we have, or\nthe most important vestiges of truth which are within our reach\u201d\n(NRH, p. 124). But even though truth is within our reach, philosophy\nbegins and ends with the quest for truth: \u201cphilosophy\nis meant\u2014and that is the decisive point\u2014not as a set of\npropositions, a teaching, or even a system, but as a way of life, a\nlife animated by a peculiar passion, the philosophic desire, or\neros; it is not understood as an instrument or a department\nof human self-realization\u201d (NRH, p. 122). As a way of life,\n\u201cthe problems are always more evident than the solutions. All\nsolutions are questionable\u2026 Therefore, the right way of life\ncannot be established metaphysically except by a completed\nmetaphysics, and therefore the right way of life remains\nquestionable\u201d (NRH, pp. 122\u2013123).\n",
