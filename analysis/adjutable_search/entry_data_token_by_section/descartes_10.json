    "main_text": "A New Metaphysics and Epistemology || Mind\u2013body relation\n3.4 Mind\u2013body relation\n\nIn the Discourse, Descartes presented the following argument\nto establish that mind and body are distinct substances:\n\nNext I examined attentively what I was. I saw that while I could\npretend that I had no body and that there was no world and no place\nfor me to be in, I could not for all that pretend that I did not\nexist. I saw on the contrary that from the mere fact that I thought of\ndoubting the truth of other things, it followed quite evidently and\ncertainly that I existed; whereas if I had merely ceased thinking,\neven if everything else I had ever imagined had been true, I should\nhave had no reason to believe that I existed. From this I knew I was a\nsubstance whose whole essence or nature is simply to think, and which\ndoes not require any place, or depend on any material thing, in order\nto exist. (6:32\u20133)\n\n\nThis argument moves from the fact that he can doubt the existence of\nthe material world, but cannot doubt the existence of himself as a\nthinking thing, to the conclusion that his thoughts belong to a\nnonspatial substance that is distinct from matter.\n\nWhile this argument might secure the existence of a thinker, it does\nnot show that the thinker is not a material thing. That conclusion\nfallaciously rests on conceivability based in ignorance. There is\nnothing to preclude that the thinking thing is in fact a complex\nmaterial system. Descartes has merely relied on the fact that he can\ndoubt the existence of matter to conclude that matter is distinct from\nmind. That argument doesn\u2019t work. From the fact that the Joker\ncannot, at a certain moment, doubt the existence of Batman (because he\nis with him), but he can doubt the existence of Bruce Wayne (who\nmight, for all the Joker knows, have been killed by the Joker\u2019s\nhenchmen), it does not follow that Bruce Wayne is not Batman. In fact,\nhe is Batman. The Joker is merely ignorant of that fact.\n\nIn the Meditations, Descartes altered the argument. In the\nSecond Meditation, he again asserted that he could doubt the existence\nof matter but not the existence of himself as a thinking thing. But he\nexplicitly refrained from concluding that his mind was distinct from\nbody, on the grounds that he remained ignorant of his nature (7:27).\nThen, in the Sixth Meditation, having established, to his\nsatisfaction, the mark of truth, he used it to support a positive\nargument that the essence of mind is thought and that a thinking thing\nis unextended; and that the essence of matter is extension and that\nextended things cannot think (7:78). He based this argument on clear\nand distinct intellectual perceptions of the essences of mind and\nmatter, not on the fact that he could doubt the existence of one or\nthe other.\n\nThis conclusion asserts the well-known substance dualism of Descartes.\nThat dualism has problems. As Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, among\nothers, asked: if mind is unextended and matter is extended, how do\nthey interact? This problem vexed not only Descartes, who admitted to\nElisabeth that he didn\u2019t have a good answer (3:694), but it also\nvexed Descartes\u2019 followers and other metaphysicians. It seems\nthat, somehow, mind and body must be brought into relation, because\nwhen we decide (a mental act) to pick up a pencil, our arm (a physical\nthing) actually moves, and when light hits our eyes, we mentally\nexperience the visible world. But how do mind and body relate? Some of\nDescartes\u2019 followers adopted the position of occasionalism,\naccording to which God mediates the causal relations between mind and\nbody; mind does not affect body and body does not affect mind, but God\ngives the mind appropriate sensations given the state of the body, and\nhe makes the body move by putting it into the correct brain state when\nwe decide (mentally) to pick up the pencil (see Lee 2020). Other\nphilosophers adopted other solutions, including the monism of Spinoza\nand the pre-established harmony of Leibniz.\n\nIn the Meditations and Principles, Descartes did not\nfocus on the metaphysical question of how mind and body interact.\nRather, he discussed the functional role of mind\u2013body union in\nthe economy of life. Our sensations serve us well in avoiding harms\nand pursuing benefits. Pain-sensations induce us toward behaviors that\nusually protect our bodily integrity. Pleasure leads us toward things\nthat are usually good for us. Our sense perceptions are reliable\nenough for distinguishing objects that need distinguishing and for\nnavigating as we move about. As Descartes saw it, \u201cGod or\nnature\u201d set up these relations for our benefit. They are not\nperfect. Sometimes our senses present things differently than they\nare, and sometimes we make judgments about sensory things that extend\nbeyond the appropriate use of the senses.\n",
