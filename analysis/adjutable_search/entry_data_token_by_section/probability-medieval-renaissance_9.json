    "main_text": "Scholastic Concepts of Probability || Testimonial and juridical probability\n3.3 Testimonial and juridical probability\n\nTestimonial probability arises from the testimony of witnesses. It is\none of the two kinds of probability which Silvester de Prierio listed\nin his Summa summarum (the other is endoxic probability):\n\u201c\u2018Probable\u2019 is used in two ways. First as the\nopposite of hidden, that is, what is proved by witnesses\n \u2026\u201d[24]\n The rapid growth of jurisprudence after the twelfth century nourished\na great interest in witness\n testimony.[25]\n It was very difficult to rely on circumstantial evidence in medieval\njurisprudence; so the testimony of witnesses was in many ways the key\nto a court decision. A complicated system of \u201chalf proofs\u201d\nand proofs was designed to safe-guard the rationality of juridical\nprocedures (Evans 2002; Franklin 2001, 15; Rosoni 1995, 89). Moreover,\neven outside the narrow confines of jurisprudence, witness testimony\nplayed an important role. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, described a\ncertainty sufficient for action:\n\n\nAnd yet the fact that in so many it is not possible to have certitude\nwithout fear of error is no reason why we should reject the certitude\nwhich can probably be had [quae probabiliter haberi potest]\nthrough two or three witnesses \u2026 (Thomas Aquinas, Summa\ntheologiae, II-II, q. 70, 2, 1488)\n\n\nThomas\u2019s remark alludes to the norm that the testimony of one\neye-witness confers probability on an assertion, whereas the\n(uncontested) testimony of two or more witnesses creates probable\ncertainty.\n\nA related but wider field for using the predicate\n\u201cprobable\u201d in juridical terminology was the classification\nof presumptions. A \u201cprobable presumption\u201d (probabilis\npresumptio) had some force in inclining a judge towards or\nagainst a verdict (Hubert 2009; Motzenb\u00e4cker 1958, 120, 159).\nMoreover, witness testimony was just one kind of evidence which could\nrender a presumption probable. Probability could also result from\n\u201ctruth-like circumstantial evidence\u201d (indicia\nverisimilia), as this statement from Huguccio documents:\n\u201cProbable is what is accepted because of common human opinion or\ntruth-like circumstantial evidence\n (indicia).\u201d[26]\n Huguccio\u2019s reference to common opinion shows that endoxic\nprobability was also relevant in the law\n courts.[27]\n Nevertheless, the treatment of signs and indicia as\nprobability generating evidence, which was strongly promoted by\nscholastic jurists, created an important precedent for connecting the\nnotion of probability to the direct evidence of an observer.\n",
