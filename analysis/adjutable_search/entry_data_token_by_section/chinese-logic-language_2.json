    "main_text": "Mohist Views on Logic and Language\n3. Mohist Views on Logic and Language\n\nThe Later Mohist writings in which logic and language are provided the\nmost extensive treatment are the entire four chapters of Book 10 and\nthe first two chapters of Book 11 of the Mo Zi (chapters\n40\u20135, collectively referred to as the Mohist Canons).\nThe chapters of Book 10 are known by the titles Jing Shang\n(Canons I), Jing Xia (Canons II), Jing\nShuo Shang (Expositions of the Canons I), and Jing\nShuo Xia (Expositions of the Canons II). In Book 11, we\nhave the Da Qu (Greater Selection) and the Xiao\nQu (Lesser Selection). The text of the Canons\nleaves a great deal unsaid; there are missing segments and obvious\ntextual errors, and interpretations of a number of critical passages\nhave exhibited widespread disagreement. For convenience, this entry\nfollows the widely recognized numbering system presented in Graham\n2003 [1978], which pairs each Canon with its corresponding\nExposition and identifies the passages from each pair by\nnumbers prefixed with the letters A and B. (For instance, passage B40\nof the Canons is from Canons II.) Graham\u2019s\nwork also reconstructs the Da Qu and the Xiao Qu\ninto a single corpus entitled Names and Objects (NO)\n(Graham 2003 [1978]), although there is controversy in his\nreconstruction of the Da Qu as a single body of writing,\ngiven the fragmentary state of many of its key sections.\n",
