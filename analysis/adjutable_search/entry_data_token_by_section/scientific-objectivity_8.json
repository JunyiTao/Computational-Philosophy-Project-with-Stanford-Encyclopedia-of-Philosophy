    "main_text": "Objectivity as Absence of Normative Commitments and the Value-Free Ideal || Science, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal\n3.3 Science, Policy and the Value-Free Ideal\n\nThe discussion so far has focused on the VNT, the practical\nattainability of the VFI, but little has been said about whether a\nvalue-free science is desirable in the first place. This subsection\ndiscusses this topic with special attention to informing and advising\npublic policy from a scientific perspective. While the VFI, and many\narguments for and against it, can be applied to science as a whole,\nthe interface of science and public policy is the place where the\nintrusion of values into science is especially salient, and where it\nis surrounded by the greatest controversy. In the 2009\n\u201cClimategate\u201d affair, leaked emails from climate\nscientists raised suspicions that they were pursuing a particular\nsocio-political agenda that affected their research in an improper\nway. Later inquiries and reports absolved them from charges of\nmisconduct, but the suspicions alone did much to damage the authority\nof science in the public arena.\n\nIndeed, many debates at the interface of science and public policy are\ncharacterized by disagreements on propositions that combine a factual\nbasis with specific goals and values. Take, for instance, the view\nthat growing transgenic crops carries too much risk in terms of\nbiosecurity, or addressing global warming by phasing out fossil\nenergies immediately. The critical question in such debates is whether\nthere are theses \\(T\\) such that one side in the debate endorses\n\\(T\\), the other side rejects it, the evidence is shared, and both\nsides have good reasons for their respective positions.\n\nAccording to the VFI, scientists should uncover an epistemic,\nvalue-free basis for resolving such disagreements and restrict the\ndissent to the realm of value judgments. Even if the VNT should turn\nout to be untenable, and a strict separation to be impossible, the VFI\nmay have an important function for guiding scientific\nresearch and for minimizing the impact of values on an objective\nscience. In the philosophy of science, one camp of scholars defends\nthe VFI as a necessary antidote to individual and institutional\ninterests, such as Hugh Lacey (1999, 2002), Ernan McMullin (1982) and\nSandra Mitchell (2004), while others adopt a critical attitude, such\nas Helen Longino (1990, 1996), Philip Kitcher (2011a) and Heather\nDouglas (2009). These criticisms we discuss mainly refer to the\ndesirability or the conceptual (un)clarity of the VFI.\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the VFI is not desirable at all.\nFeminist philosophers (e.g., Harding 1991; Okruhlik 1994; Lloyd 2005)\nhave argued that science often carries a heavy androcentric values,\nfor instance in biological theories about sex, gender and rape. The\ncharge against these values is not so much that they are contextual\nrather than cognitive, but that they are unjustified. Moreover, if\nscientists did follow the VFI rigidly, policy-makers would pay even\nless attention to them, with a detrimental effect on the decisions\nthey take (Cranor 1993). Given these shortcomings, the VFI has to be\nrethought if it is supposed to play a useful role for guiding\nscientific research and leading to better policy decisions.\n Section 4.3\n and\n section 5.2\n elaborate on this line of criticism in the context of scientific\ncommunity practices, and a science in the service of society.\n\nSecond, the autonomy of science often fails in practice due to the\npresence of external stakeholders, such as funding agencies and\nindustry lobbies. To save the epistemic authority of science, Douglas\n(2009: 7\u20138) proposes to detach it from its autonomy by\nreformulating the VFI and distinguishing between direct and\nindirect roles of values in science. Contextual values may\nlegitimately affect the assessment of evidence by indicating the\nappropriate standard of evidence, the representation of complex\nprocesses, the severity of consequences of a decision, the\ninterpretation of noisy datasets, and so on (see also Winsberg 2012).\nThis concerns, above all, policy-related disciplines such as climate\nscience or economics that routinely perform scientific risk analyses\nfor real-world problems (cf. also Shrader-Frechette 1991). Values\nshould, however, not be \u201creasons in themselves\u201d, that is,\nevidence or defeaters for evidence (direct role, illegitimate) and as\n\u201chelping to decide what should count as a sufficient\nreason for a choice\u201d (indirect role, legitimate). This\nprohibition for values to replace or dismiss scientific evidence is\ncalled detached objectivity by Douglas, but it is\ncomplemented by various other aspects that relate to a reflective\nbalancing of various perspectives and the procedural, social aspects\nof science (2009: ch. 6).\n\nThat said, Douglas\u2019 proposal is not very concrete when it comes\nto implementation, e.g., regarding the way diverse values should be\nbalanced. Compromising in the middle cannot be the solution (Weber\n1917 [1949]). First, no standpoint is, just in virtue of being in the\nmiddle, evidentially supported vis-\u00e0-vis more extreme\npositions. Second, these middle positions are also, from a practical\npoint of view, the least functional when it comes to advising\npolicy-makers.\n\nMoreover, the distinction between direct and indirect roles of values\nin science may not be sufficiently clear-cut to police the legitimate\nuse of values in science, and to draw the necessary borderlines.\nAssume that a scientist considers, for whatever reason, the\nconsequences of erroneously accepting hypothesis \\(H\\) undesirable.\nTherefore he uses a statistical model whose results are likely to\nfavor \u00ac\\(H\\) over \\(H\\). Is this a matter of reasonable\nconservativeness? Or doesn\u2019t it amount to reasoning to a\nforegone conclusion, and to treating values as evidence (cf. Elliott\n2011: 320\u2013321)?\n\nThe most recent literature on values and evidence in science presents\nus with a broad spectrum of opinions. Steele (2012) and Winsberg\n(2012) agree that probabilistic assessments of uncertainty involve\ncontextual value judgments. While Steele defends this point by\nanalyzing the role of scientists as policy advisors, Winsberg points\nto the influence of contextual values in the selection and\nrepresentation of physical processes in climate modeling. Betz (2013)\nargues, by contrast, that scientists can largely avoid making\ncontextual value judgments if they carefully express the uncertainty\ninvolved with their evidential judgments, e.g., by using a scale\nranging from purely qualitative evidence (such as expert judgment) to\nprecise probabilistic assessments. The issue of value judgments at\nearlier stages of inquiry is not addressed by this proposal; however,\ndisentangling evidential judgments and judgments involving contextual\nvalues at the stage of theory assessment may be a good thing in\nitself.\n\nThus, should we or should we not worried about values in scientific\nreasoning? While the interplay of values and evidential considerations\nneed not be pernicious, it is unclear why it adds to the\nsuccess or the authority of science. How are we going to ensure that\nthe permissive attitude towards values in setting evidential standards\netc. is not abused? In the absence of a general theory about which\ncontextual values are beneficial and which are pernicious, the VFI\nmight as well be as a first-order approximation to a sound,\ntransparent and objective science.\n",
