    "main_text": "The Socratic problem: Who was Socrates really? || Contemporary interpretative strategies\n2.2 Contemporary interpretative strategies\n\nIf it were possible to confine oneself exclusively to Plato\u2019s\nSocrates, the Socratic problem would nevertheless reappear\nbecause one would soon discover Socrates himself defending one\nposition in one Platonic dialogue, its contrary in another, and using\ndifferent methods in different dialogues to boot. Inconsistencies\namong the dialogues seem to demand explanation, though not all\nphilosophers have thought so (Shorey 1903). Most famously, the\nParmenides attacks various theories of forms that the\nRepublic, Symposium, and Phaedo develop and\ndefend. In some dialogues (e.g., Laches), Socrates only weeds\nthe garden of its inconsistencies and false beliefs, but in other\ndialogues (e.g., Phaedrus), he is a planter as well,\nadvancing structured philosophical claims and suggesting new methods\nfor testing those claims. There are differences on smaller matters as\nwell. For example, Socrates in the Gorgias opposes, while in\nthe Protagoras he supports, hedonism; the details of the\nrelation between erotic love and the good life differ from\nPhaedrus to Symposium; the account of the relation\nbetween knowledge and the objects of knowledge in Republic\ndiffers from the Meno account; despite Socrates\u2019s\ncommitment to Athenian law, expressed in the Crito, he vows\nin the Apology that he will disobey the lawful jury if it\norders him to stop philosophizing. A related problem is that some of\nthe dialogues appear to develop positions familiar from other\nphilosophical traditions (e.g., that of Heraclitus in\nTheaetetus and Pythagoreanism in Phaedo). Three\ncenturies of efforts to solve versions of the Socratic problem are\nsummarized in the following supplementary document:\n\nEarly Attempts to Solve the Socratic Problem\n\n\nContemporary efforts recycle bits and pieces\u2014including the\nfailures\u2014of these older attempts.\nThe Twentieth Century\n\nUntil relatively recently in modern times, it was hoped that confident\nelimination of what could be ascribed purely to Socrates would leave\nstanding a coherent set of doctrines attributable to Plato (who\nappears nowhere in the dialogues as a speaker). Many philosophers,\ninspired by the nineteenth century scholar Eduard Zeller, expect the\ngreatest philosophers to promote grand, impenetrable schemes. Nothing\nof the sort was possible for Socrates, so it remained for\nPlato to be assigned all the positive doctrines that could be\nextracted from the dialogues. In the latter half of the twentieth\ncentury, however, there was a resurgence of interest in who\nSocrates was and what his own views and methods were. The\nresult is a narrower, but no less contentious, Socratic problem. Two\nstrands of interpretation dominated views of Socrates in the twentieth\ncentury (Griswold 2001; Klagge and Smith 1992). Although there has\nbeen some healthy cross-pollination and growth since the mid 1990s,\nthe two were so hostile to one another for so long that the bulk of\nthe secondary literature on Socrates, including translations peculiar\nto each, still divides into two camps, hardly reading one another:\nliterary contextualists and analysts. The literary-contextual study of\nSocrates, like hermeneutics more generally, uses the tools of literary\ncriticism\u2014typically interpreting one complete dialogue at a\ntime; its European origins are traced to Heidegger and earlier to\nNietzsche and Kierkegaard. The analytic study of Socrates, like\nanalytic philosophy more generally, is fueled by the arguments in the\ntexts\u2014typically addressing a single argument or set of\narguments, whether in a single text or across texts; its origins are\nin the Anglo-American philosophical tradition. Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1900\u20132002) was the doyen of the hermeneutic strand, and Gregory\nVlastos (1907\u20131991) of the analytic.\nLiterary contextualism\n\nFaced with inconsistencies in Socrates\u2019s views and methods from\none dialogue to another, the literary contextualist has no Socratic\nproblem because Plato is seen as an artist of surpassing literary\nskill, the ambiguities in whose dialogues are intentional\nrepresentations of actual ambiguities in the subjects philosophy\ninvestigates. Thus terms, arguments, characters, and in fact all\nelements in the dialogues should be addressed in their literary\ncontext. Bringing the tools of literary criticism to the study of the\ndialogues, and sanctioned in that practice by Plato\u2019s own use of\nliterary devices and practice of textual critique (Protagoras\n339a\u2013347a, Republic 2.376c\u20133.412b, Ion,\nand Phaedrus 262c\u2013264e), most contextualists ask of\neach dialogue what its aesthetic unity implies, pointing out\nthat the dialogues themselves are autonomous, containing almost no\ncross-references. Contextualists who attend to what they see as the\naesthetic unity of the whole Platonic corpus, and therefore seek a\nconsistent picture of Socrates, advise close readings of the dialogues\nand appeal to a number of literary conventions and devices said to\nreveal Socrates\u2019s actual personality. For both varieties of\ncontextualism, the Platonic dialogues are like a brilliant\nconstellation whose separate stars naturally require separate\nfocus.\n\nMarking the maturity of the literary contextualist tradition in the\nearly twenty-first century is a greater diversity of approaches and an\nattempt to be more internally critical (see Hyland 2004).\nAnalytic developmentalism\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Vlastos (1991, 45\u201380) recommended a set\nof mutually supportive premises that together provide a plausible\nframework in the analytic tradition for Socratic philosophy as a\npursuit distinct from Platonic \n philosophy.[6]\n Although the premises have\ndeep roots in early attempts to solve the Socratic problem (see the\nsupplementary document linked above), the beauty of Vlastos\u2019s\nparticular configuration is its fecundity. The first premise marks a\nbreak with a tradition of regarding Plato as a dialectician who held\nhis assumptions tentatively and revised them constantly; rather,\n\nPlato held philosophical doctrines, and\nPlato\u2019s doctrines developed over the period in\nwhich he wrote,\n\n\naccounting for many of the inconsistencies and contradictions among\nthe dialogues (persistent inconsistencies are addressed with a complex\nnotion of Socratic irony.) In particular, Vlastos tells a story\n\u201cas hypothesis, not dogma or reported fact\u201d describing the\nyoung Plato in vivid terms, writing his early dialogues while\nconvinced of \u201cthe substantial truth of Socrates\u2019s teaching\nand the soundness of its method.\u201d Later, Plato develops into a\nconstructive philosopher in his own right but feels no need to break\nthe bond with his Socrates, his \u201cfather image.\u201d (The\nremainder of Plato\u2019s story is not relevant to Socrates.) Vlastos\nlabels a small group of dialogues \u2018transitional\u2019 to mark\nthe period when Plato was beginning to be dissatisfied with\nSocrates\u2019s views. Vlastos\u2019s third premise is\n\nIt is possible to determine reliably the chronological order in\nwhich the dialogues were written and to map them to the development of\nPlato\u2019s views.\n\n\nThe evidence Vlastos uses varies for this claim, but is of several\ntypes: stylometric data, internal cross references, external events\nmentioned, differences in doctrines and methods featured, and other\nancient testimony (particularly that of Aristotle). The dialogues of\nPlato\u2019s Socratic period, called \u201celenctic dialogues\u201d\nfor Socrates\u2019s preferred method of questioning, are Apology,\nCharmides, Crito, Euthyphro, Gorgias, Hippias Minor, Ion, Laches,\nProtagoras, and book 1 of the Republic. The\ndevelopmentalists\u2019 Platonic dialogues are potentially a discrete\nsequence, the order of which enables the analyst to separate Socrates\nfrom Plato on the basis of different periods in Plato\u2019s\nintellectual evolution. Finally,\n\nPlato puts into the mouth of Socrates only what Plato himself\nbelieves at the time he writes each dialogue.\n\n\n\u201cAs Plato changes, the philosophical persona of his Socrates is\nmade to change\u201d (Vlastos 1991, 53)\u2014a view sometimes\nreferred to as the \u201cmouthpiece theory.\u201d Because the\nanalyst is interested in positions or doctrines (particularly as\nconclusions from, or tested by, arguments), the focus of analysis is\nusually on a particular philosophical view in or across dialogues,\nwith no special attention given to context or to dialogues considered\nas wholes; and evidence from dialogues in close chronological\nproximity is likely to be considered more strongly confirming than\nthat from dialogues of other developmental periods. The result of\napplying the premises is a firm list (contested, of course, by others)\nof ten theses held by Socrates, all of which are incompatible with the\ncorresponding ten theses held by Plato (1991, 47\u201349).\n\nMany analytic ancient philosophers in the late twentieth century mined\nthe gold Vlastos had uncovered, and many of those who were productive\nin the developmentalist vein in the early days went on to constructive\nwork of their own (see Bibliography).\n",
