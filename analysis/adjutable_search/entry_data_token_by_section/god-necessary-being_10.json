    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects II: Views on Which There Aren\u2019t Necessarily Existing Abstract Objects that All Are Grounded in God || Mixed View 1: Mentalism-Platonism\n4.4 Mixed View 2: Anti-Bootstrapping Emanationism\n\nThis is a view designed wholly to avoid bootstrapping worries that\naffect theistic emanationism. It really is a sort of modified\ntheistic activism, and it may actually be the sort of view Gould and\nDavis (2014) would like to hold. The idea is this: Ascertain the\nnecessarily existing abstracta that cause bootstrapping problems\n(e.g., being God, being omnipotent, etc.) for the\nemanationist. Those exist independently of God. All other necessarily\nexisting abstracta are causally grounded in God in the way the\ntheistic emanationist thinks abstracta are grounded in God. \n\nSo far as I can tell, no one holds this first mixed view. Perhaps the\nreader is thinking that that is because it is obviously ad\nhoc: The sole motivation for the two classes of abstracta in the\ntheory is avoidance of bootstrapping worries. This is too strong, I\nthink. There is a reason why certain abstracta create\nbootstrapping problem. That reason is that they have to do with God in\na way that other abstracta that don\u2019t cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t. So why not say that Leibniz or Menzel and Morris\nare right about all the non-God related abstracta? To put it another\nway, why not be an emanationist about all the abstracta one can be an\nemanationist about\u2014those that don\u2019t have to do with God?\n\n\nThat said, there is at least a whiff of ad-hocness here. The\nmotivation for this theory presumably would be that of perfect being\ntheology. For the proponent of this first mixed view must think that\nthe quantifiers in relevant religious texts are actually restricted.\nThey aren\u2019t as restricted as the theistic Platonist\nthinks they are. But she will agree with the theistic Platonist that\nit\u2019s false that all (read the quantifier wide open) entities are\ncreated by/depend on/grounded in God. It\u2019s worth pointing out\nthat it\u2019s not clear how to delineate precisely those abstracta\nthat lead to bootstrapping problems and those that don\u2019t. The\nbest one can do seems to be to say that those that cause bootstrapping\nproblems don\u2019t depend on God, and all others God causes to\nexist. But presumably for each necessarily existing abstract object,\neither it gives rise to bootstrapping problems, or it doesn\u2019t.\nSo there should be two non-overlapping classes of abstract objects at\nhand here, even if we\u2019re not able to specify more descriptively\nwhich abstracta are in which class.\n\nIt would be better if the emanationist could find a cogent reply to\nbootstrapping concerns. But if she can\u2019t, she may plump for\nbeing an emanationist about all abstracta save those having to do with\nGod.\n",
