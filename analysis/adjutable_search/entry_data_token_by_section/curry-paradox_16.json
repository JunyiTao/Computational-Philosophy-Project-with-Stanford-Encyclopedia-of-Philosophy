    "main_text": "Validity Curry || Connective Form\n6.1 Connective Form\n\n\nFor one form of v-Curry paradox, let the conditional mentioned in the\n definition of a Curry sentence\n (Definition 1)\n be a consequence connective \\({\\Rightarrow}\\). A sentence\nwith \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as its major operator is to be interpreted\nthus: \u201cThat \\(p\\) entails (according to \\(\\mathcal{T}\\)) that\n\\(q\\)\u201d. \nWe now immediately obtain property-theoretic, set-theoretic or\ntruth-theoretic versions of Curry\u2019s paradox, provided only that\n\\({\\Rightarrow}\\) meets the conditions MP and Cont of the\nCurry-Paradox Lemma. \n\n\nWhat makes this instance of the Curry-Paradox\nLemma particularly troublesome is that it poses an obstacle to one\ncommon response to Curry\u2019s paradox, namely the weakly\n contraction-free response discussed in\n section 4.2.1.  That response depended on\n rejecting the rule CP of single-premise conditional proof, one\ndirection of the single-premise \u201cdeduction theorem\u201d. But\nthis is a rule that has seemed difficult to resist for a consequence\nconnective (Shapiro 2011; Weber 2014; Zardini 2013). If \\(\\beta\\) is\na consequence of \\(\\alpha\\) according to the consequence relation of\ntheory \\(\\mathcal{T}\\), where this theory has \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) as\nits own consequence connective, then \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) must surely\ncontain the consequence claim \\(\\alpha\n{\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\). Likewise, this variety of Curry paradox poses\nan obstacle for detachment-free responses, which require\nrejecting the rule MP. If a theory with its own consequence\nconnective contains both \\(\\alpha\\) and the consequence conditional\n\\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\), then it must surely contain \\(\\beta\\)\nas well. Or so, at least, it has seemed. Admittedly, the proponent of\na weakly detachment-free response will argue that MP for\n \\({\\Rightarrow}\\) illicitly builds in transitivity\n (see section 4.2.2).  Still, what seems\n inescapable is the converse of CP, the rule CCP that is the other\ndirection of the single-premise deduction theorem. If a theory\ncontains the consequence conditional \\(\\alpha {\\Rightarrow}\\beta\\),\nthen surely \\(\\beta\\) follows from \\(\\alpha\\) according to the\ntheory. That would still rule out a strongly detachment-free\nresponse.\n",
