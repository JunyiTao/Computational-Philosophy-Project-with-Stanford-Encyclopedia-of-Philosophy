    "main_text": "Impact of Turing Machines on Computer Science\n5. Impact of Turing Machines on Computer Science\n\nTuring is today one of the most celebrated figures of computer\nscience. Many consider him as the father of computer science and the\nfact that the main award in the computer science community is called\nthe Turing award is a clear indication of that (Daylight 2015). This\nwas strengthened by the Turing centenary celebrations from 2012, which\nwere largely coordinated by S. Barry Cooper. This resulted not only in\nan enormous number of scientific events around Turing but also a\nnumber of initiatives that brought the idea of Turing as the father of\ncomputer science also to the broader public (Bullynck, Daylight, &\nDe Mol 2015). Amongst Turing\u2019s contributions which are today\nconsidered as pioneering, the 1936 paper on Turing machines stands out\nas the one which has the largest impact on computer science. However,\nrecent historical research shows also that one should treat the impact\nof Turing machines with great care and that one should be careful in\nretrofitting the past into the present.\n",
