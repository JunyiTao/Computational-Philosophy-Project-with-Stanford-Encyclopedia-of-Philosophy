    "main_text": "Contemporary Eliminative Materialism\n2. Contemporary Eliminative Materialism\n\nModern versions of eliminative materialism claim that our common-sense\nunderstanding of psychological states and processes is deeply mistaken\nand that some or all of our ordinary notions of mental states will\nhave no home, at any level of analysis, in a sophisticated and\naccurate account of the mind. In other words, it is the view that\ncertain common-sense mental states, such as beliefs and desires, do\nnot exist. To establish this claim, eliminativists typically endorse\ntwo central and controversial claims which we will examine below. Much\nof our discussion will focus upon our notion of belief, since it\nfigures so prominently in contemporary discussions of eliminative\nmaterialism. However, many of the arguments presented below are\nthought to generalize to other mental notions\u2014especially other\npropositional attitudes. \n",
