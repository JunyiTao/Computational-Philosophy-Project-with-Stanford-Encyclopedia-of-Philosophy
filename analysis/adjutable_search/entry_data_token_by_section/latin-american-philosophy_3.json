    "main_text": "The Contemporary Period || Normalcy and the Generation of 1910 (1940\u20131960)\n2.2 Normalcy and the Generation of 1910 (1940\u20131960)\n\nIt is not until the generation born around 1910 reached maturity in\nthe 1940s that a self-critical spirit clearly entered Latin American\nphilosophy. A state of normalcy became established in most countries\nof Latin America, and what might be called Latin-Americanism\ngrew significantly. The limitations on originality characteristic of\nprevious generations were in part the result of the lack of\nself-criticism and the practical difficulties involved in pursuing a\nphilosophical career in Latin America. The contribution of those\ngenerations was largely restricted to the importation of foreign\nthought; originality in substantive doctrine was rarely achieved, or\neven an ambition.\n\nThere were exceptions, of course. Romero, for example, in his\nTheory of Man (1952), developed an original\nphilosophical anthropology. However, philosophers and philosophical\npractice was not \u201cnormalized,\u201d as Romero put it, until the emergence\nof the subsequent generation philosophers. That group included Risieri\nFrondizi (1910\u20131985), Eduardo Garc\u00eda Maynez\n(1908\u20131993), Miguel Reale (1910\u20132006), Francisco\nMir\u00f3 Quesada (1918\u2013), Leopoldo Zea (1912\u20132004), and\nJuan Llamb\u00edas de Azevedo (1907\u20131972).\n\nThis group was the first generation of Latin American philosophers to\nbenefit from formal education in philosophy. Previous philosophers had\nbeen mostly self-taught, typically trained in another profession,\nbut taking up philosophy out of personal interest. The\nstructural changes in the academy introduced by the Founders and the\ngeneration that followed made it possible for an entire generation to\nbe trained by philosophers at the university.\n\nAnother important general feature of this period of Latin American\nphilosophy was that the incipient Latin-Americanism of the previous\ngeneration developed and flourished. This change became evident with\nthe philosophers born around 1910 and those who followed them. Several\nphilosophers of this generation readily traveled throughout Latin\nAmerica and establishing dialogue with other Latin Americans. This is\nnot to say that Latin-Americanism in philosophy was very robust. Even\ntoday, lack of region-wide philosophical dialogue remains more common\nthan not, and communities of discourse tend to be more local or\nnational than international. Still, philosophical communication within\nLatin America markedly increased during this period.\n\nOne of the factors that helped the development of philosophy was the\nincreasing consciousness of a distinctly Latin American philosophical\nidentity, of a sense that there was something different or distinctive\nabout Latin American philosophy. In part, this was a result of growing\nconsciousness of the increasing importance of Latin America in the\nworld and, on the philosophical side, of the introduction in Latin\nAmerica of Ortega\u2019s perspectivism. By the time of Samuel Ramos and\nLeopoldo Zea, the Founders\u2019 preoccupation with the existence of an\nautochthonous Latin American philosophy gave rise to a controversy\nabout whether and how it existed. This debate was one in which\npractically all important philosophers of the period participated. In\nturn, this debate provided impetus to the study and dissemination of\nthe philosophical work of Latin American thinkers throughout the\nregion.\n\nNotable work in this vein includes An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez\nReulet\u2019s (1910\u20131997) groundbreaking work, published\nin Tierra Firme in 1936 and entitled \u201cPanorama de las\nideas filos\u00f3ficas en Hispanoam\u00e9rica.\u201d Subsequent\nwork by Zea on positivism in Mexico, written in the early 1940s, as\nwell as Ramos\u2019 historical study of Mexican philosophy took up the\nthread, as did Ram\u00f3n Insua Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s history of\nphilosophy in Hispanic America and Guillermo Francovich\u2019s account of\nphilosophy in Bolivia. In the eight decades since the publication of\nS\u00e1nchez Reulet\u2019s essay, there has been a remarkable\nproliferation of work concerned with the identity of Latin American\nphilosophy. In addition, anthologies, specialized works, and critical\neditions of Latin American philosophical classics have been\npublished. The very controversy concerning the existence and\npossibility of an autochthonous Latin American philosophy that drew so\nmuch attention in the second quarter of the twentieth century (and,\nfor that matter, still continues), has helped to promote and spread\nthe knowledge of Latin American thought and the philosophical dialogue\namong Latin American philosophers.[3]\n\nA second factor that contributed to philosophical growth and\nLatin-Americanism was political oppression and the periodic repression\nof intellectual freedom in Latin America. This was not a phenomenon\nlimited to any one period of Latin American philosophy. The colonial\nregime was without a doubt paradigmatic of intellectual oppression and\ncontrol, but the fact of oppression and intellectual constraints\nbecame more profound after independence. In the nineteenth century,\npositivists used philosophy as an instrument for specific political\nand social agendas, and it was used as a basis for suppressing\ndissent. In the twentieth century this oppressive pattern was not\nlimited to a specific intellectual orientation; philosophical\nsuppression became institutionalized in regimes of the right and the\nleft.  The result has always been the same: intellectual abuse, the\nviolation of rights indispensable for the pursuit of philosophical\nideas and their investigation, the lack of freedom of expression, and\nthe manipulation of pedagogic institutions and scientific\ninvestigation for political and ideological ends. Latin American\nintellectuals subject to these pressures have regularly been forced to\ngo into exile, a state of affairs that has become almost customary and\nis prevalent to this day in some countries. Frondizi\u2019s life is\nparadigmatic of the situation: his many trips throughout Latin America\nwere the result of the periodic political upheavals and oppression in\nArgentina. An indirect but unexpectedly beneficial result of this\nrecurring situation was that the philosophical peripatetism of Latin\nAmerican philosophers contributed to inter-American philosophical\ndialogue.\n\nPhilosophy in Latin America was also transformed by the arrival of\nSpanish \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Among the most influential were:\nJoaquin Xirau (1895\u20131946), Eduardo Nicol (1907\u20131990),\nJos\u00e9 Ferrater Mora (1912\u20131991), Jos\u00e9 Gaos\n(1900\u20131969), Luis Recas\u00e9ns Siches (1903\u20131977), Juan\nD. Garc\u00eda Bacca (1901\u20131992), Jos\u00e9 Medina\nEchevarr\u00eda (1903\u20131977), Maria Zambrano (1904\u2013191),\nand almost fifty others (see Abell\u00e1n, 1967). There were diverse\neffects of the arrival of this group. First, their migrations\nthroughout Latin America helped break down some of the national\nbarriers between philosophical communities in Latin America. The\nconception of hispanidad that they inherited from Miguel de\nUnamuno and from Ortega, and the need to establish themselves in Latin\nAmerica, helped the process; they went from country to country,\nspreading ideas and contributing to the increase in philosophical\ndialogue. Second, many of them helped implement changes in university\ncurricula across Latin America, frequently establishing lasting\nprograms in philosophy. The effects of their work became evident when\nthe generation born around 1910 reached maturity. It was at that point\nthat Latin American philosophers began to think and act\nphilosophically in pan-Latin American terms, traveling, exchanging\nideas, and cooperating in projects of common interest.\n\nThe period that goes from 1940 to 1960 does not reveal drastic changes\nin philosophical orientation. The generation of the Founders used\nFrench vitalism as an instrument to reject positivism, and the\nfollowing generation, with Ortega\u2019s help, took charge of the process,\nincorporating German philosophy and the new ideas introduced by\nphenomenology and existentialism. At this time, Martin Heidegger\n(1889\u20131976) and Jean\u2013Paul Sartre (1905\u20131980)\nconstituted the dominant philosophical force in Latin\nAmerica. Simultaneously, scholasticism experienced renewed\nimpetus. The number of sympathizers of philosophical analysis and\nMarxism continued to grow, but Thomism, phenomenology, existentialism,\nand various versions of nationalist and culturalist philosophy were\nthe dominant approaches throughout Latin America. Those working\noutside the dominant currents had little institutional power.\n",
