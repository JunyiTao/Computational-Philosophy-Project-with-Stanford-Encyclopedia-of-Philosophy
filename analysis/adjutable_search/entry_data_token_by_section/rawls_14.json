    "main_text": "Justice as Fairness: Justice within a Liberal Society || The Basic Structure of Society\n4.1 The Basic Structure of Society\n\nJustice as fairness aims to describe a just arrangement of the major\npolitical and social institutions of a liberal society: the political\nconstitution, the legal system, the economy, the family, and so on.\nRawls calls the arrangement of these institutions a society\u2019s\nbasic structure. The basic structure is the location of\njustice because these institutions distribute the main benefits and\nburdens of social life: who will receive social recognition, who will\nhave which basic rights, who will have opportunities to get what kind\nof work, what the distribution of income and wealth will be, and so\non.\n\nThe form of a society\u2019s basic structure will have profound\neffects on the lives of citizens. The basic structure will influence\nnot only citizens\u2019 life prospects, but more deeply their goals,\ntheir attitudes, their relationships, and their characters.\nInstitutions that will have such pervasive influence on people\u2019s\nlives require justification. Since leaving one\u2019s society is not\na realistic option for most people, the justification cannot be that\ncitizens have consented to a basic structure by staying in the\ncountry. And since the rules of any basic structure will be coercively\nenforced, often with serious penalties, the demand to justify the\nimposition of any particular set of rules intensifies further.\n\nIn setting out justice as fairness, Rawls assumes that the liberal\nsociety in question is marked by reasonable pluralism as described\nabove, and also that it is under reasonably favorable conditions: that\nthere are enough resources for it to be possible for everyone\u2019s\nbasic needs to be met. Rawls makes the simplifying assumption that the\nsociety is self-sufficient and closed, so that citizens enter it only\nby birth and leave it only at death. He also confines his attention\nmainly to ideal theory, putting aside non-ideal theory such as on\ncriminal justice.\n",
