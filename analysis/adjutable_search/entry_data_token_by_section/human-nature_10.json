    "main_text": "Explanatory Human Properties\n4. Explanatory Human Properties\n\nThe replacement of the concept of a fully developed form with a\nstatistical notion yields a deflationary account of human nature with,\nat most, restricted explanatory import. The correlative, explanatory\nnotion in the original package, that of the fully developed\nform\u2019s blueprint (TP2), has to some authors seemed worth\nreframing in terms made possible by advances in modern biology,\nparticularly in genetics.\n\nClearly, there must be explanations of why humans generally walk on\ntwo legs, speak and plan many of their actions in advance.\nGenealogical, or what have been called \u201cultimate\u201d (Mayr)\nor \u201chistorical\u201d (Kitcher) explanations can advert to the\naccumulation of coherence among entrenched, stable properties along a\nlineage. These may well have resulted from selection pressures shared\nby the relevant organisms (cf. Wimsatt 2003; Lewens 2009). The fact\nthat there are exceptions to any generalisations concerning\ncontemporary humans does not entail that there is no need for\nexplanations of such exception-allowing generalisations. Plausibly,\nthese general, though not universal truths will have \u201cstructural\nexplanations\u201d, that is, explanations in terms of underlying\nstructures or mechanisms (Kitcher 1986: 320; Devitt 2008: 353). These\nstructures, so seems, might to a significant degree be inscribed in\nhumans\u2019 DNA.\n\nThe precise details of rapidly developing empirical science will\nimprove our understanding of the extent to which there is a\ndeterminate relationship between contemporary humans\u2019 genome and\ntheir physical, psychological and behavioural properties. There is,\nhowever, little plausibility that the blueprint metaphor might be\napplicable to the way DNA is transcribed, translated and interacts\nwith its cellular environment. Such interaction is itself subject to\ninfluence by the organism\u2019s external environment, including its\nsocial environment (Dupr\u00e9 2001: 29ff.; 2003: 111ff.; Griffiths\n2011: 326; Prinz 2012: 17ff.; Griffiths & Tabery 2013: 71ff.;\nGriffiths & Stotz 2013: 98ff., 143ff.). For example, the feature\nof contemporary human life for which there must according to Aristotle\nbe some kind of blueprint, viz. rational agency, is, as Sterelny has\nargued, so strongly dependent on social scaffolding that any claim to\nthe effect that human rationality is somehow genetically programmed\nignores the causal contributions of manifestly indispensable\nenvironmental factors (Sterelny 2018: 120).\n",
