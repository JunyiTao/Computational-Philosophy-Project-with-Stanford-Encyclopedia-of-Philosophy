    "main_text": "Controversies || Bias in Critical Thinking Theory and Pedagogy\n12.2 Bias in Critical Thinking Theory and Pedagogy\n\nCritics have objected to bias in the theory, pedagogy and practice of\ncritical thinking. Commentators (e.g., Alston 1995; Ennis 1998) have\nnoted that anyone who takes a position has a bias in the neutral sense\nof being inclined in one direction rather than others. The critics,\nhowever, are objecting to bias in the pejorative sense of an\nunjustified favoring of certain ways of knowing over others,\nfrequently alleging that the unjustly favoured ways are those of a\ndominant sex or culture (Bailin 1995). These ways favour:\n\nreinforcement of egocentric and sociocentric biases over\ndialectical engagement with opposing world-views (Paul 1981, 1984;\nWarren 1998)\ndistancing from the object of inquiry over closeness to it (Martin\n1992; Thayer-Bacon 1992)\nindifference to the situation of others over care for them (Martin\n1992)\norientation to thought over orientation to action (Martin\n1992)\nbeing reasonable over caring to understand people\u2019s ideas\n(Thayer-Bacon 1993)\nbeing neutral and objective over being embodied and situated\n(Thayer-Bacon 1995a)\ndoubting over believing (Thayer-Bacon 1995b)\nreason over emotion, imagination and intuition (Thayer-Bacon\n2000)\nsolitary thinking over collaborative thinking (Thayer-Bacon\n2000)\nwritten and spoken assignments over other forms of expression\n(Alston 2001)\nattention to written and spoken communications over attention to\nhuman problems (Alston 2001)\nwinning debates in the public sphere over making and understanding\nmeaning (Alston 2001)\n\n\nA common thread in this smorgasbord of accusations is dissatisfaction\nwith focusing on the logical analysis and evaluation of reasoning and\narguments. While these authors acknowledge that such analysis and\nevaluation is part of critical thinking and should be part of its\nconceptualization and pedagogy, they insist that it is only a part.\nPaul (1981), for example, bemoans the tendency of atomistic teaching\nof methods of analyzing and evaluating arguments to turn students into\nmore able sophists, adept at finding fault with positions and\narguments with which they disagree but even more entrenched in the\negocentric and sociocentric biases with which they began. Martin\n(1992) and Thayer-Bacon (1992) cite with approval the self-reported\nintimacy with their subject-matter of leading researchers in biology\nand medicine, an intimacy that conflicts with the distancing allegedly\nrecommended in standard conceptions and pedagogy of critical thinking.\nThayer-Bacon (2000) contrasts the embodied and socially embedded\nlearning of her elementary school students in a Montessori school, who\nused their imagination, intuition and emotions as well as their\nreason, with conceptions of critical thinking as\n\n\nthinking that is used to critique arguments, offer justifications, and\nmake judgments about what are the good reasons, or the right answers.\n(Thayer-Bacon 2000: 127\u2013128)\n\n\nAlston (2001) reports that her students in a women\u2019s studies\nclass were able to see the flaws in the Cinderella myth that pervades\nmuch romantic fiction but in their own romantic relationships still\nacted as if all failures were the woman\u2019s fault and still\naccepted the notions of love at first sight and living happily ever\nafter. Students, she writes, should\n\n\nbe able to connect their intellectual critique to a more affective,\nsomatic, and ethical account of making risky choices that have sexist,\nracist, classist, familial, sexual, or other consequences for\nthemselves and those both near and far\u2026 critical thinking that\nreads arguments, texts, or practices merely on the surface without\nconnections to feeling/desiring/doing or action lacks an ethical depth\nthat should infuse the difference between mere cognitive activity and\nsomething we want to call critical thinking. (Alston 2001: 34)\n\n\nSome critics portray such biases as unfair to women. Thayer-Bacon\n(1992), for example, has charged modern critical thinking theory with\nbeing sexist, on the ground that it separates the self from the object\nand causes one to lose touch with one\u2019s inner voice, and thus\nstigmatizes women, who (she asserts) link self to object and listen to\ntheir inner voice. Her charge does not imply that women as a group are\non average less able than men to analyze and evaluate arguments.\nFacione (1990c) found no difference by sex in performance on his\nCalifornia Critical Thinking Skills Test. Kuhn (1991: 280\u2013281)\nfound no difference by sex in either the disposition or the competence\nto engage in argumentative thinking.\n\nThe critics propose a variety of remedies for the biases that they\nallege. In general, they do not propose to eliminate or downplay\ncritical thinking as an educational goal. Rather, they propose to\nconceptualize critical thinking differently and to change its pedagogy\naccordingly. Their pedagogical proposals arise logically from their\nobjections. They can be summarized as follows:\n\nFocus on argument networks with dialectical exchanges reflecting\ncontesting points of view rather than on atomic arguments, so as to\ndevelop \u201cstrong sense\u201d critical thinking that transcends\negocentric and sociocentric biases (Paul 1981, 1984).\nFoster closeness to the subject-matter and feeling connected to\nothers in order to inform a humane democracy (Martin 1992).\nDevelop \u201cconstructive thinking\u201d as a social activity\nin a community of physically embodied and socially embedded inquirers\nwith personal voices who value not only reason but also imagination,\nintuition and emotion (Thayer-Bacon 2000).\nIn developing critical thinking in school subjects, treat as\nimportant neither skills nor dispositions but opening worlds of\nmeaning (Alston 2001).\nAttend to the development of critical thinking dispositions as\nwell as skills, and adopt the \u201ccritical pedagogy\u201d\npractised and advocated by Freire (1968 [1970]) and hooks (1994)\n(Dalgleish, Girard, & Davies 2017).\n\n\nA common thread in these proposals is treatment of critical thinking\nas a social, interactive, personally engaged activity like that of a\nquilting bee or a barn-raising (Thayer-Bacon 2000) rather than as an\nindividual, solitary, distanced activity symbolized by Rodin\u2019s\nThe Thinker. One can get a vivid description of education\nwith the former type of goal from the writings of bell hooks (1994,\n2010). Critical thinking for her is open-minded dialectical exchange\nacross opposing standpoints and from multiple perspectives, a\nconception similar to Paul\u2019s \u201cstrong sense\u201d critical\nthinking (Paul 1981). She abandons the structure of domination in the\ntraditional classroom. In an introductory course on black women\nwriters, for example, she assigns students to write an\nautobiographical paragraph about an early racial memory, then to read\nit aloud as the others listen, thus affirming the uniqueness and value\nof each voice and creating a communal awareness of the diversity of\nthe group\u2019s experiences (hooks 1994: 84). Her \u201cengaged\npedagogy\u201d is thus similar to the \u201cfreedom under\nguidance\u201d implemented in John Dewey\u2019s Laboratory School of\nChicago in the late 1890s and early 1900s. It incorporates the\ndialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring that Abrami (2015) found\nto be most effective in improving critical thinking skills and\ndispositions.\n",
