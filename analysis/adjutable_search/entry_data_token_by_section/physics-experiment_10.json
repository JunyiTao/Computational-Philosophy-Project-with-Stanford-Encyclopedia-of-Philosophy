In this section arguments will be presented that these\ndiscussions also apply to biology.\n\nAlthough all of the illustrations of the epistemology of experiment\ncome from physics, David Rudge (1998; 2001) has shown that they are\nalso used in biology. His example is Kettlewell\u2019s (1955; 1956;\n1958) evolutionary biology experiments on the Peppered Moth,\nBiston betularia. The typical form of the moth has a\npale speckled appearance and there are two darker forms, f.\ncarbonaria, which is nearly black, and f. insularia,\nwhich is intermediate in color. The typical form of the moth\nwas most prevalent in the British Isles and Europe until the middle of\nthe nineteenth century. At that time things began to change.\nIncreasing industrial pollution had both darkened the surfaces of\ntrees and rocks and had also killed the lichen cover of the forests\ndownwind of pollution sources. Coincident with these changes,\nnaturalists had found that rare, darker forms of several moth species,\nin particular the Peppered Moth, had become common in areas downwind\nof pollution sources.\n\nKettlewell attempted to test a selectionist explanation of this\nphenomenon. E.B. Ford (1937; 1940) had suggested a two-part\nexplanation of this effect: 1) darker moths had a superior physiology\nand 2) the spread of the melanic gene was confined to industrial areas\nbecause the darker color made carbonaria more conspicuous to\navian predators in rural areas and less conspicuous in polluted areas.\nKettlewell believed that Ford had established the superior viability\nof darker moths and he wanted to test the hypothesis that the darker\nform of the moth was less conspicuous to predators in industrial\nareas.\n\nKettlewell\u2019s investigations consisted of three parts. In the\nfirst part he used human observers to investigate whether his proposed\nscoring method would be accurate in assessing the relative\nconspicuousness of different types of moths against different\nbackgrounds. The tests showed that moths on \u201ccorrect\u201d\nbackgrounds, typical on lichen covered backgrounds and dark\nmoths on soot-blackened backgrounds were almost always judged\ninconspicuous, whereas moths on \u201cincorrect\u201d backgrounds\nwere judged conspicuous.\n\nThe second step involved releasing birds into a cage containing all\nthree types of moth and both soot-blackened and lichen covered pieces\nof bark as resting places. After some difficulties (see Rudge 1998 for\ndetails), Kettlewell found that birds prey on moths in an order of\nconspicuousness similar to that gauged by human observers.\n\nThe third step was to investigate whether birds preferentially prey on\nconspicuous moths in the wild. Kettlewell used a\nmark-release-recapture experiment in both a polluted environment\n(Birmingham) and later in an unpolluted wood. He released 630 marked\nmale moths of all three types in an area near Birmingham, which\ncontained predators and natural boundaries. He then recaptured the\nmoths using two different types of trap, each containing virgin\nfemales of all three types to guard against the possibility of\npheromone differences.\n\nKettlewell found that carbonaria was twice as likely to\nsurvive in soot-darkened environments (27.5 percent) as was\ntypical (12.7 percent). He worried, however, that his results\nmight be an artifact of his experimental procedures. Perhaps the traps\nused were more attractive to one type of moth, that one form of moth\nwas more likely to migrate, or that one type of moth just lived\nlonger. He eliminated the first alternative by showing that the\nrecapture rates were the same for both types of trap. The use of\nnatural boundaries and traps placed beyond those boundaries eliminated\nthe second, and previous experiments had shown no differences in\nlongevity. Further experiments in polluted environments confirmed that\ncarbonaria was twice as likely to survive as\ntypical. An experiment in an unpolluted environment showed\nthat typical was three times as likely to survive as\ncarbonaria. Kettlewell concluded that such selection was the\ncause of the prevalence of carbonaria in polluted\nenvironments.\n\nRudge also demonstrates that the strategies used by Kettlewell are\nthose described above in the epistemology of experiment. His examples\nare given in Table 1. (For more details see Rudge 1998).\n\n\n\n\n \nEpistemological strategies\nExamples from Kettlewell \n\n1.\nExperimental checks and calibration in which the apparatus\nreproduces known phenomena.\nUse of the scoring experiment to verify that the proposed\nscoring methods would be feasible and objective. \n\n2.\nReproducing artifacts that are known in advance to be\npresent.\nAnalysis of recapture figures for endemic betularia\npopulations. \n\n3.\nElimination of plausible sources of background and alternative\nexplanations of the result.\nUse of natural barriers to minimize migration. \n\n4.\nUsing the results themselves to argue for their validity.\nFilming the birds preying on the moths. \n\n5.\nUsing an independently well-corroborated theory of the\nphenomenon to explain the results.\nUse of Ford\u2019s theory of the spread of industrial\nmelanism. \n\n6.\nUsing an apparatus based on a well- corroborated theory.\nUse of Fisher, Ford, and Shepard techniques. [The\nmark-release-capture method had been used in several earlier\nexperiments] \n\n7.\nUsing statistical arguments.\nUse and analysis of large numbers of moths. \n\n8.\nBlind analysis\nNot used. \n\n9.\nIntervention, in which the experimenter manipulates the object\nunder observation\nNot present \n\n10.\nIndependent confirmation using different experiments.\nUse of two different types of traps to recapture the moths.\n \n\n\nTable 1. Examples of epistemological\nstrategies used by experimentalists in evolutionary biology, from\nH.B.D. Kettlewell\u2019s (1955, 1956, 1958) investigations of\nindustrial melanism.
