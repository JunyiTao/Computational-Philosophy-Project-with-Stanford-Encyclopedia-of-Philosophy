    "main_text": "The Ethics of Ambiguity: Bad Faith, the Appeal, the Artist\n5. The Ethics of Ambiguity: Bad Faith, the Appeal, the Artist\n\nIt is impossible to know where Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s thinking\nwould have gone had she been spared the cold, the hunger and the fear\nof living in Nazi occupied Paris. What we do know is that in coming\nface to face with forces of injustice beyond her control, the\nquestions of evil and the other took on new urgency. Beauvoir speaks\nof the war as creating an existential rupture in time. She speaks of\nherself as having undergone a conversion. She can no longer afford the\nluxury of focusing on her own happiness and pleasure. The question of\nevil becomes a pressing concern. One cannot refuse to take a stand.\nOne is either a collaborator or not. In writing The Ethics of\nAmbiguity, Beauvoir takes her stand. She identifies herself as an\nexistentialist and identifies existentialism as the philosophy of our\n(her) times because it is the only philosophy that takes the question\nof evil seriously. It is the only philosophy prepared to counter\nDostoevsky\u2019s claim that without God everything is permissible.\nThat we are alone in the world and that we exist without guarantees,\nare not, however, the only truths of the human condition. There is\nalso the truth of our freedom and this truth, as detailed in The\nEthics of Ambiguity, entails a logic of reciprocity and\nresponsibility that contests the terrors of a world ruled only by the\nauthority of power.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity, published in 1947, reconsiders the\nidea of invulnerable freedom advanced in Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as. Dropping the distinction between the inner and\nouter domains of freedom and deploying a unique understanding of\nconsciousness as an intentional activity, Beauvoir now argues that I\ncan be alienated from my freedom. Similar to She Came To\nStay, which bears the imprint of Hegel\u2019s account of the\nfight to the death that sets the stage for the master-slave dialectic,\nand Pyrrhus and Cin\u00e9as, which works through the\nCartesian implications of our existential situation, The Ethics of\nAmbiguity redeploys concepts of canonical philosophical figures.\nHere Beauvoir takes up the phenomenologies of Husserl and Hegel to\nprovide an analysis of intersubjectivity that accepts the singularity\nof the existing individual without allowing that singularity to\njustify an epistemological solipsism, an existential isolationism or\nan ethical egoism. The Hegel drawn on here is the Hegel who resolves\nthe inequalities of the master-slave relationship through the justice\nof mutual recognition. The Husserl appealed to is the Husserl who\nintroduced Beauvoir to the thesis of intentionality.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity opens with an account of\nintentionality which designates the meaning-disclosing and\nmeaning-desiring activities of consciousness as both insistent and\nambiguous\u2014insistent in that they are spontaneous and\nunstoppable; ambiguous in that they preclude any possibility of\nself-unification or closure. Beauvoir describes the intentionality of\nconsciousness as operating in two ways. First, there is the activity\nof wanting to disclose the meaning of being. Second, there is the\nactivity of bringing meaning to the world. In the first mode of\nactivity consciousness expresses its freedom to discover meaning. In\nthe second, it uses its freedom to articulate meaning and give meaning\nto the world. Beauvoir identifies each of these intentionalities with\na mood: the first with the mood of joy, the second with the dual moods\nof hope and domination. Whether the second moment of intentionality\nbecomes the ground of projects of liberation or exploitation depends\non whether the mood of hope or domination prevails.\n\nDescribing consciousness as ambiguous, Beauvoir identifies our\nambiguity with the idea of failure. We can never fulfill our passion\nfor meaning in either of its intentional expressions; that is, we will\nnever succeed in fully revealing the meaning of the world, and never\nbecome God, the author of the meaning of the world. These truths of\nintentionality set the criteria of Beauvoir\u2019s ethics. Finding\nthat ethical systems and absolutes, insofar as they claim to give\nfinal answers to our ethical dilemmas and authoritarian justifications\nfor our actions, offer dangerous consolations for our failure to be\nthe absolute source of the world\u2019s meaning or being, Beauvoir\nrejects these systems of absolutes in favor of ethical projects that\nacknowledge our limits and recognize the future as open. From this\nperspective, her ethics of ambiguity might be characterized as an\nethics of existential hope.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s The Ethics of Ambiguity is a secularism that\nrejects the ideas of God and Humanity. Their apparent differences\nconceal a common core: both claim to have identified an absolute\nsource and justification for our beliefs and actions. They allow us to\nevade responsibility for creating the conditions of our existence and\nto flee the anxieties of ambiguity. Whether it is called the age of\nthe Messiah or the classless society, these appeals to a utopian\ndestiny encourage us to think in terms of ends which justify means.\nThey invite us to sacrifice the present for the future. They are the\nstuff of inquisitions, imperialisms, gulags and Auschwitz. Privileging\nthe future over the present they pervert our relationship to time,\neach other and ourselves. Insisting that the future is undecided and\nthat its form will be shaped by our present decisions, Beauvoir argues\nthat it is only by insisting on the dignity of today\u2019s human\nbeings that the dignity of those to come can be secured.\n\nBeauvoir rejects the familiar charge against secularism made famous by\nDostoevsky\u2019s Grand Inquisitor: \u201cIf God is dead everything\nis permitted\u201d. As she sees it, without God to pardon us for our\n\u201csins\u201d we are totally and inexcusably responsible for our\nactions. Dostoevsky was mistaken. The problem of secularism is not\nthat of license, it is the problem of the \u201cwe\u201d. Can\nseparate individuals be bound to each other? Can they forge laws\nbinding for all? The Ethics of Ambiguity insists that they\ncan. It does this by arguing that evil resides in the denial of\nfreedom (mine and others), that we are responsible for ensuring the\nexistence of the conditions of freedom (the material conditions of a\nminimal standard of living and the political conditions of uncensored\ndiscourse and association), and that I can neither affirm nor live my\nfreedom without also affirming the freedom of others.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s argument for ethical freedom begins by noting a\nfundamental fact of the human condition. We begin our lives as\nchildren who are dependent on others and embedded in a world already\nendowed with meaning. We are born into the condition that Beauvoir\ncalls the \u201cserious world\u201d. This is a world of ready made\nvalues and established authorities. This is a world where obedience is\ndemanded. For children, this world is not alienating for they are too\nyoung to assume the responsibilities of freedom. As children who\ncreate imaginary worlds, we are in effect learning the lessons of\nfreedom\u2014that we are creators of the meaning and value of the\nworld. Free to play, children develop their creative capacities and\ntheir ability to confer meaning to the world without, however, being\nheld accountable for the worlds they bring into being. Considering\nthese two dimensions of children\u2019s lives, their imaginative\nfreedom and their freedom from responsibility, Beauvoir determines\nthat the child lives a metaphysically privileged existence. Children,\nshe says, experience the joys but not the anxieties of freedom.\nBeauvoir also, however, describes children as mystified. By this she\nmeans that they believe that the foundations of the world are secure\nand that their place in the world is naturally given and unchangeable.\nBeauvoir marks adolescence as the end of this idyllic era. It is the\ntime of moral decision. Emerging into the world of adults, we are now\ncalled upon to renounce the serious world, to reject the mystification\nof childhood, and to take responsibility for our choices.\n\nAll of us pass through the age of adolescence; not all of us take up\nits ethical demands. The fact of our initial dependency and obedience\nto the serious world has moral implications because it predisposes us\nto the temptations of bad faith, strategies by which we deny our\nexistential freedom and our moral responsibility. It sets our desire\nin the direction of a nostalgia for those lost Halcyon days. Looking\nto return to the security of that metaphysically privileged time, some\nof us evade the responsibilities of freedom by choosing to remain\nchildren, that is, we submit to the authority of others and live in\nthe serious world.\n\nBeauvoir does not object to the mystification of childhood. She\nacknowledges that parental authority is necessary for the\nchild\u2019s survival, and she insists that this shelter of safety\nshould cultivate a child\u2019s freedom. To choose to remain a child\nis an act of bad faith. To treat adults as children, however, is\nimmoral and evil. If we are exploited, enslaved or terrorized,\nhowever, our submission to authority of the other cannot be counted as\nan act of bad faith. Absent these conditions, Beauvoir holds us\naccountable for our response to the experience of freedom. We cannot\nuse the anxieties of freedom either as an excuse for our active\nparticipation in or for our passive acceptance of the exploitation of\nothers. Hiding behind the authority of others or establishing\nourselves as authorities over others are culpable offenses.\n\nBeauvoir portrays the complexity of the ways that we either avoid or\naccept the responsibilities of freedom through the figures of the\nsub-man, the serious man, the nihilist, the adventurer, the passionate\nman, the critical thinker and the artist-writer. These figures are\nimaginary, but also historical in the sense that they are lived, and\nso, disclosed in the actions of human beings. The point of delineating\nthese human types is several fold. It is a way of distinguishing\nbetween two kinds of unethical positions. One position, portrayed in\nthe portraits of the sub-man and the serious man, is to refuse to\nrecognize the experience of freedom. The other position, depicted in\nthe pictures of the nihilist, the adventurer and the maniacally\npassionate man, is to misread the meanings of freedom. The ethical\nperson, as portrayed by Beauvoir, is driven by passion. Unlike the\negoistic, maniacal passion of the tyrant, however, the ethical passion\nof the artist-writer is defined by its generosity\u2014specifically\nthe generosity of recognizing the other\u2019s singularity and\nprotecting the other in their difference from becoming an object of\nanother\u2019s will.\n\nIn describing the different ways that freedom is evaded or misused,\nBeauvoir distinguishes ontological from ethical freedom. She shows us\nthat acknowledging our freedom is a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for ethical action. To meet the conditions of the ethical,\nfreedom must be used properly. It must, according to Beauvoir, embrace\nthe ties that bind me to others and take up the appeal\u2014an act\nwhereby I call on others, in their freedom, to join me in bringing\ncertain values, projects, and conditions into being. Artists and\nwriters embody the ethical ideal in several respects. Their work\nexpresses the subjective passion that grounds the ethical life. They\ndescribe the ways that the material and political complexities of our\nsituations can either alienate us from our freedom or open us to it.\nBy envisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers\nchallenge the mystifications that validate sacrificing the present for\nthe future. They establish the essential relationship between my\nfreedom and the freedom of others.\n\nThe Ethics of Ambiguity does not avoid the question of\nviolence. Determining that violence is sometimes necessary, Beauvoir\nuses the example of a young Nazi soldier to argue that to liberate the\noppressed we may have to destroy their oppressors. However, she\ndistances herself from the argument of Pyrrhus and\nCin\u00e9as; now she identifies violence as an assault on the\nother\u2019s freedom (however misused) and as such this violence\nmarks our failure to respect the \u201cwe\u201d of our humanity.\nThus, The Ethics of Ambiguity provides an analysis of our\nexistential-ethical situation that joins a hard-headed realism\n(violence is an unavoidable fact of our condition) with demanding\nrequirements. It is unique, however, in aligning this realism and\nthese requirements with the passion of generosity and a mood of\njoy.\n",
