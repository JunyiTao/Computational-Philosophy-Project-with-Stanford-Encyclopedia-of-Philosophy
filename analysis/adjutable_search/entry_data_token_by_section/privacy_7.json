    "main_text": "Meaning and Value\n3. Meaning and Value\n\nWhen considering the concept of the private, it is sometimes difficult\nto separate the descriptive element of meaning from the normative\ndetermination. The determination of the meaning of privacy often\ncontains clear normative elements, such as when Fried (1968) claims\nthat the meaning of privacy consists in protecting trust and intimacy,\nor when Nissenbaum (2010) defines privacy as the adequate flow of\ninformation (which requires protection). In this article, an attempt\nwill be made to separate the descriptive and normative aspects as\nclearly as possible. In the following section, an overview of the\nrelation between the concept of privacy and other concepts will first\nbe given, followed by a descriptive overview of the meaning of\nprivacy. Finally, we will discuss the various normative determinations\nthat have been given to privacy.\n",
