    "main_text": "How to Argue for and Evaluate Theories of Legal Interpretation || The Potential for Divergence between Theories of Law and Theories of Legal Interpretation\n5.2 The Potential for Divergence between Theories of Law and Theories of Legal Interpretation\nIn the preceding subsection, I relied on the simplifying assumption that, if legal interpretation seeks the content of the law, then whether a method of legal interpretation is correct depends only on whether it treats the determinants of the content of the law as contributing to the content of the law in the way that they in fact do so. On this assumption, there is no gap between a theory of law and a theory of legal interpretation. If the correct theory of law is that the content of the law is determined by, say, the semantic content of the authoritative legal texts, then the best method of legal interpretation is to ascertain the semantic content of the authoritative legal texts.\nDepending on how we understand the province of a theory of legal interpretation, it may be important to qualify this straightforward approach in several ways. (See Greenberg 2020, 136\u2013141 for fuller discussion.) To begin with, legal interpretation is sensitive to evidentiary considerations in a way that the theory of law is not. Thus, a theory of legal interpretation may provide guidance as to what kinds of evidence are most reliable. Differently, there may be legal or moral reasons \u2013 as opposed to reasons of accuracy \u2013 not to permit consulting certain kinds of evidence. For example, it is plausible that, for reasons of democracy and fairness, private diaries of legislators are not appropriate kinds of evidence, even if consulting them would yield more accurate conclusions about the content of the law.\nMore generally, the theory of legal interpretation may take into account goals other than accurately identifying a provision\u2019s contribution. For example, it is often suggested that courts should adhere to the plain meaning of a provision in order to provide an incentive for good drafting. Improving the drafting of statutory and other provisions may in the long run help legal interpreters to identify provisions\u2019 contributions accurately as well as providing other benefits. In the short run, however, the goal of improving the drafting of legal texts may conflict with the goal of accurately identifying a provision\u2019s contribution. There is an important question to what extent it is appropriate for legal interpretation to pursue the former goal at the expense of the latter. To take a very different kind of example, there may be moral reasons why some kinds of mistakes are worse than others (or why mistakes by certain decision-makers are worse than mistakes by others). Such reasons may support following methods that would minimize the more problematic kinds of mistakes at the expense of overall accuracy.\nAnother important departure from the straightforward assumption that the correct theory of legal interpretation simply tracks the true theory of law would take into account the abilities and limitations of legal interpreters. Consideration of bounded rationality raises important issues for a theory of legal interpretation. Judges, to take an especially important group, operate with limited time and information and they are subject to human cognitive limitations and biases much discussed in recent literature. See entry on Bounded Rationality. Given these facts, it might be counterproductive for judges to directly aim to treat legal sources as contributing to the law in the way that they in fact contribute. They might do better overall at accurately identifying the way in which sources contribute to the content of the law if they instead followed some kind of relatively simple rule of thumb.[41] Similarly, we might also have special accounts for other participants in the legal system, for example, for legislators, executive officials, and police officers.\nIt could be debated whether taking into account agents\u2019 abilities and limitations properly belongs in the theory of legal interpretation. It might be, for example, that the proper place to take into account judges\u2019 biases and limitations is the theory of adjudication. Let\u2019s set aside this largely terminological question. Instead, we can distinguish between different degrees and kinds of idealization in the theory of legal interpretation. For example, one type of highly idealized theory asks how a legal interpreter without cognitive or time limitations best ascertains what the law is given the legally and morally permissible evidence (without taking into account values other than accuracy, except for the restriction to permissible evidence). A somewhat less idealized kind of theory asks how agents with specific abilities and limitations would, under real-world conditions, including limited time, do best at accurately identifying provisions\u2019 contributions. Finally, we could ask how a legal interpreter should proceed taking into account not just accuracy, but also the kinds of values illustrated above, such as promoting good drafting.\n",
