    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of modularity has loomed large in philosophy of psychology\nsince the early 1980s, following the publication of Fodor\u2019s\nlandmark book The Modularity of Mind (1983). In the decades\nsince the term \u2018module\u2019 and its cognates first entered the\nlexicon of cognitive science, the conceptual and theoretical landscape\nin this area has changed dramatically. Especially noteworthy in this\nrespect has been the development of evolutionary psychology, whose\nproponents adopt a less stringent conception of modularity than the\none advanced by Fodor, and who argue that the architecture of the mind\nis more pervasively modular than Fodor claimed. Where Fodor (1983,\n2000) draws the line of modularity at the relatively low-level systems\nunderlying perception and language, post-Fodorian theorists such as\nSperber (2002) and Carruthers (2006) contend that the mind is modular\nthrough and through, up to and including the high-level systems\nresponsible for reasoning, planning, decision making, and the like.\nThe concept of modularity has also figured in recent debates in\nphilosophy of science, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of\nlanguage\u2014further evidence of its utility as a tool for\ntheorizing about mental architecture.\n",
