    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nThoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1817 and died there in\n1862, at the age of forty-four. Like that of his contemporary\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Thoreau\u2019s intellectual career unfolded\nin a close and polemical relation to the town in which he spent almost\nhis entire life. After graduating from Harvard in 1837, he struck up a\nfriendship with fellow Concord resident Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose\nessay \u201cNature\u201d he had first encountered earlier that year.\nAlthough the two American thinkers had a turbulent relationship due to\nserious philosophical and personal differences, they had a profound\nand lasting effect upon one another. It was in the fall of 1837 that\nThoreau made his first entries in the multivolume journal he would\nkeep for the rest of his life. Most of his published writings were\ndeveloped from notes that first appeared on these pages, and Thoreau\nsubsequently revised many entries, suggesting that his journal can be\nconsidered a finished work in itself. During his lifetime he published\nonly two books, along with numerous shorter essays that were first\ndelivered as lectures. He lived a simple and relatively quiet life,\nmaking his living briefly as a teacher and pencil maker but mostly as\na land surveyor. Thoreau had intimate bonds with his family and\nfriends (the loss of his brother John in 1842 was a major trauma) and\nremained unmarried, although he was deeply in love at least twice. His\nfirst book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, was\nstill a work in progress in 1845, when he went to live in the woods by\nWalden Pond for two years and two months. This\n\u201cexperiment\u201d in living on the outskirts of town was an\nintensive time of examination for Thoreau, as he drew close to nature\nand contemplated the final ends of his own life, which was otherwise\nat risk of ending in quiet desperation. Thoreau viewed his existential\nquest as a venture in philosophy, in the ancient Greek sense of the\nword, because it was motivated by an urgent need to find a reflective\nunderstanding of reality that could inform a life of wisdom. This is\nbecause, according to the belief that philosophy is a way of life,\nthat very way of life \u201cwill necessarily be deliberative and\nreflective\u201d; accordingly, for Thoreau, \u201cthinking about his\nlife in the woods is central to his life in the woods\u201d (Bates\n2012, 29). Moreover, it is only after having cultivated \u201ca\nmeticulous and discerning awareness of the particularities of\nnature\u201d in one specific place (Robinson 2004, 100) that he\nbecame able to articulate a vision of the human being\u2019s capacity to be\ngrounded and at home in the world.\n\nHis experience bore fruit in the 1854 publication of his literary\nmasterpiece Walden, a work that almost defies categorization:\nit is a work of narrative prose which often soars to poetic heights,\ncombining philosophical speculation with close observation of a\nconcrete place. It is a rousing summons to the examined life and to\nthe realization of one\u2019s potential, while at the same time it\ndevelops what might be described as a religious vision of the human\nbeing and the universe. Walden has been admired by a larger\nworld audience than any other book written by an American author,\nand\u2014whether or not it ought to be called a work of\nphilosophy\u2014it contains a substantial amount of philosophical\ncontent, which deserves to be better appreciated than it has been.\nStanley Cavell has argued that Thoreau is an embarrassment to\n\u201cwhat we have learned to call philosophy,\u201d since his work\nembodies \u201ca mode of conceptual accuracy\u201d that is\n\u201cbased on an idea of rigor\u201d somewhat foreign to the\nacademic establishment (Cavell 1988, 14). Yet, as Cavell also notes,\nphilosophical authors have more than one way to go about their\nbusiness, and Thoreau\u2014like Descartes in the\nMeditations\u2014begins his argument by accounting for how\nhe has come to believe that certain questions need to be addressed. In\nother words, his method is predicated on the belief that it is\nphilosophically worthwhile to clarify the basis of your own perplexity\nand unrest (see Reid 2012, 46). And this is only one way of explaining\nhow a significant part of the challenge in coming to terms with\nThoreau is that his philosophy, like Nietzsche\u2019s, has a literary\nand poetic quality. The reader is charged with finding the coherence\nof Thoreau\u2019s whole philosophical outlook. Accordingly, this\nentry attempts to delineate the main themes of Thoreau\u2019s\nproject, in the hope of serving as an aid and stimulus to further\nstudy. It draws upon Thoreau\u2019s entire corpus, including the\nworks he left in manuscript that were published after his death.\n",
