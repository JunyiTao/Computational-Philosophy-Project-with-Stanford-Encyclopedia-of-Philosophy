    "main_text": "Recent Areas of Study: The Brain and Human Behavior || Cognitive Science\n6.2 Cognitive Science\n\nThe last of these brings us to cognitive science, which focuses more\nspecifically on connections between the structure of the brain and\nbehavior\u2014such as career choices. Arguments from brain\ndifferences to a differential ability of men and women when it comes\nto math and science (see\n section 1.1)\n are not unusual. Such moves and the scientific research on the brain\nthat surrounds them have led Cordelia Fine to identify these\napproaches as part of a pattern that she calls\n\u201cneurosexism\u201d (Fine 2010). Simon Baron-Cohen\u2019s work\nprovides an example (2003) in that he connects the different\nstructures of the brain with behaviors that are identified as\nspecifically male or female. His argument relies on combining two\ntheoretical tools\u2014brain organization theory and evolutionary\ntheory. The resulting evolutionary psychology seeks to give an account\nof differences in the behavior of men and women that result from the\ndifferent adaptive pressures that males and females have had to face\n(the evolutionary portion of the argument relies on Darwinian sexual\nselection). The sexual differentiation and brain differentiation go\ntogether to produce differences in brains adapted for different\nreproductive roles. In Baron-Cohen\u2019s account, these different\nadaptive pressures result in a female brain that evolved for\nempathizing with others (E brains) and a male brain that evolved for\nsystematizing (S brains).\n\nAgain, this sort of approach relies upon organizational theory, which\nis not critically examined, and is extended to non-reproductive\nbehavior, such as the ability to do science\u2014an ability claimed\nto be greatly diminished in the sex that (on average) does not have a\nsystematizing brain. The fundamental point that these approaches are\nresistant to the consideration of alternatives is at the heart of this\nfeminist critique.\n\nAdditionally, there is some dispute about whether the claimed sex\ndifferences in behavior are real. As examples, Grossi and Fine\nchallenge the claim that mental spatial rotation skills are superior\nfor males. Recent evidence suggests that when girls and women practice\nspatial rotation, say through video games, the differences in\nperformance rapidly disappear (Feng, Spence, and Pratt 2007). Similar\narguments can also be made about empathizers. Sex differences in\nlanguage proficiency tend to disappear as children grow older. There\nare also reasons to doubt the accuracy of the tests used to produce\nevidence of cognitive sex difference given that not all methods of\ntesting produce the same results (Grossi and Fine 2012: 78). Finally,\nwhen there does seem to be evidence of sex differences in behavior\nthese differences are highly sensitive to the social context. Girls\nwhose performance is poorer on math tests when they are reminded of\ntheir gender, do better when gender is made less salient (see the\ndiscussion of stereotype threat in\n section 1.1).\n\nFeminists have offered several other lines of response to claims that\ndifferences in brain structure and behavior are linked. Letitia\nMeynell argues that the illusion of transparency in brain imaging\nthrough fMRI and the consequent understanding of these images as\nobjective evidence disguises the ways they are read and interpreted\nthrough our already existing notions of gender (Meynell 2012). Ginger\nHoffman (2012) appeals to the plasticity of the brain and a truly\ninteractive understanding of the relationship between the brain and\nthe social environment in which it functions to challenge the idea\nthat observed differences in brain structure indicate immutable\ndifferences between the sexes. Victoria Pitts-Taylor (2016a) argues\nfor understanding the brain as both biological and social\u2014shaped\nby its bodily/social presence in the world.\n\nThese last points reinforce that the assumptions underlying the\ncritiqued accounts (e.g., that organizational theory is correct, that\nhormones are sex hormones) are held dogmatically. It is worth noting\nthat this is not an idle claim\u2014these assumptions can be and have\nbeen investigated. For example, the assumption about the\n\u201cmaleness\u201d of testosterone and its causal relation to\ncertain \u201cmale\u201d behaviors is challenged by recent research\nthat indicates that engaging in stereotypically male behaviors (making\nmovements that are associated with wielding a sword) can increase the\nproduction of testosterone in both males and females (van Anders,\nSteiger, & Goldey 2015). This sort of research lends plausibility\nto a more interactive account and erodes a sharp distinction between\nbiology and society.\n",
