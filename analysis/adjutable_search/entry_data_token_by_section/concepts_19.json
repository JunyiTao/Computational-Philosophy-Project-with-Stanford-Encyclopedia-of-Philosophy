One is that it makes sense of a good deal of philosophical\npractice\u2014what George Bealer (1998) calls the standard\njustificatory procedure. Thought experiments and the elicitation\nof intuitions are characteristic features of philosophical practice.\nIf this practice is justified, then there has to be an understanding\nof what philosophy is that explains why. Conceptual analysis is\nsupposed to provide just what\u2019s needed here. Intuitions can be\nsaid to be of value to philosophy precisely because they help us to\nget clearer about our concepts, especially concepts of intrinsic\nphilosophical interest (JUSTICE, KNOWLEDGE, etc.).\n\nA related attraction is that conceptual analysis explains how\nphilosophy could be an a priori discipline, as many suppose it is. If\nphilosophy is primarily about concepts and concepts can be\ninvestigated from the armchair, then the a priori character of\nphilosophy is secured (Jackson 1998).\n\nA third attraction of conceptual analysis is that conceptual analysis\nhas been argued to be a necessary precursor for answering questions\nabout ontological reduction, that is, the sort of reduction that takes\nplace when it\u2019s argued that genes are DNA segments, that\nsensations are brain states, and so on (Chalmers 1996, Jackson 1998).\nAccording to one way of filling this view out, one has to begin with\nan a priori analysis of the higher-level concept, particularly an\nanalysis that makes explicit its causal relations. One can then appeal\nto empirical findings regarding the things that actually have those\ncausal relations. For example, neuroscience may reveal that\nsuch-and-such brain state has the causal relations that analysis\nreveals to be constitutive of our concept of pain. In the course of\ndoing this, neuroscience is supposed to be showing us what pain is\n(Lewis 1966, Armstrong 1968). But neuroscience is only in a position\nto do this against the background of the philosophical work that goes\ninto articulating the concept. (For detailed treatments of this view\nof reduction, see Chalmers 1996, 2010 and Jackson 1998\u2014though it\nshould be noted that Chalmers argues that PAIN, and other concepts of\nconscious mental states, cannot be analyzed solely in terms of their\ncausal relations and concludes from this that consciousness itself is\nirreducible.) This work has generated a great deal of debate (e.g.,\nBlock & Stalnaker 1999, Levine 2001, Laurence & Margolis 2003,\nYablo 2008, Papineau 2002).\n\nA fourth attraction is that conceptual analysis may offer normative\nguidance (Goldman 1986). For instance, epistemologists face the\nquestion of whether our inferential practices are justified and, if\nso, what justifies them. One standard answer is that they can be\njustified if they conform to our intuitions about what counts as a\njustified inference (Goldman 1986). In other words, an analysis of our\nconcept of justification is supposed to be all that is needed in order\nto establish that a set of inference rules is justified. So if it ever\nturned out that different groups of people employed qualitatively\ndifferent sets of inferential principles, we could establish the\nepistemically preferable one by showing that it does a better job of\nconforming to our concept of justification.\n",
