    "main_text": "\n\nMathematically, quantum mechanics can be regarded as a non-classical\nprobability calculus resting upon a non-classical propositional logic.\nMore specifically, in quantum mechanics each probability-bearing\nproposition of the form \u201cthe value of physical quantity \\(A\\)\nlies in the range \\(B\\)\u201d is represented by a projection operator\non a Hilbert space \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). These form a non-Boolean\u2014in\nparticular, non-distributive\u2014orthocomplemented lattice.\nQuantum-mechanical states correspond exactly to probability measures\n(suitably defined) on this lattice.\n\nWhat are we to make of this? Some have argued that the empirical\nsuccess of quantum mechanics calls for a revolution in logic itself.\nThis view is associated with the demand for a realistic interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, i.e., one not grounded in any primitive notion\nof measurement. Against this, there is a long tradition of\ninterpreting quantum mechanics operationally, that is, as being\nprecisely a theory of measurement. On this latter view, it is not\nsurprising that a \u201clogic\u201d of measurement-outcomes, in a\nsetting where not all measurements are compatible, should prove not to\nbe Boolean. Rather, the mystery is why it should have the\nparticular non-Boolean structure that it does in quantum\nmechanics. A substantial literature has grown up around the programme\nof giving some independent motivation for this\nstructure\u2014ideally, by deriving it from more primitive and\nplausible axioms governing a generalized probability theory.\n",
