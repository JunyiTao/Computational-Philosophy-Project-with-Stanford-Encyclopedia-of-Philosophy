In this sense, we\ncan speak of metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy, even if the particular\nquestions and positions that arose differed from those dominant in\nEurope. Explicit metaphysical discussions appeared in China with a\nturn toward questions of cosmogony in the mid-fourth century BCE.\nThese cosmogonies express views that became fundamental for almost all\nlater metaphysics in China. In these texts, all things are\ninterconnected and constantly changing. They arise spontaneously from\nan ultimate source (most often called dao \u9053, the way\nor guide) that resists objectification but is immanent in the world\nand accessible to cultivated people. Vitality and growth is the very\nnature of existence, and the natural world exhibits consistent\npatterns that can be observed and followed, in particular, cyclical\npatterns based on interaction between polar forces (such as\nyin \u9670 and yang \u967d).\n\nThis outlook differs from the assumptions that dominated metaphysical\nthinking in Europe after the introduction of Christianity: the belief\nthat the ultimate principle of the world is transcendent but\nanthropomorphic (as human beings are made in its image), that the\nthings of the world arise through design, and that the world is\ncomposed of ontologically distinct substances. These assumptions have\nbeen widely rejected by philosophers over the course of the\n20th century, and in the Chinese tradition we see one\npossibility for what metaphysics might look like if it were neither\napologizing for nor reacting against such views (in Nietzsche\u2019s\nterms, a metaphysics based neither on God nor the Death of God). This\nis not to say that Chinese metaphysics is homogenous or without its\nown problems. Rather, we can say that while European metaphysics has\ntended to center on problems of reconciliation (how\nontologically distinct things can interact), Chinese metaphysics has\nbeen more concerned with problems of distinction. The most\ncentral problems are around the status of individualized things, the\nrelationship between the patterns of nature and specifically human\nvalues, and how to understand the ultimate ground of the world in a\nway that avoids either reification or nihilism. These become problems\nprecisely because of the underlying assumptions of holism and\nchange.\n\nReaders should keep in mind that a survey of metaphysics in Chinese\nPhilosophy is no more adequate than such a survey would be regarding\nEurope. The entry has necessarily left out more than it has included.\nAside from introducing the most influential positions and\nphilosophers, the goal is to illuminate recurring patterns and\nconcerns that can serve as orientation for further reading.\n", "toc": [{"#TheMetChi": "1.

Is there \u201cMetaphysics\u201d in Chinese Philosophy?\n\nThis entire entry could be taken up with the question begged by its\ntitle: Is there metaphysics in Chinese Philosophy? Rather than argue\nfor the legitimacy of my topic in the abstract, I will explicate\nspecific issues and positions from various Chinese philosophers,\nleaving it to readers to decide how well they fit the category of\nmetaphysics. Nonetheless, I cannot entirely ignore the problem of\napplying the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d so far beyond its Greek\norigins, and so a few preliminary comments are\n necessary.[1]\n\nIf we designate an area of philosophical inquiry concerned with the\nultimate nature of reality\u2014its being, origins, components, ways\nof changing, and so on\u2014there is no question that Chinese\nphilosophers addressed issues within this domain. The question is, do\nwe apply the label of \u201cmetaphysics\u201d to philosophical\narguments within this domain, or do we reserve the label for some\nspecifically European approach or theory? The latter faces an obvious\nproblem\u2014any definition broad enough to include all European\napproaches will include some Chinese theories, just as any definition\nnarrow enough to exclude all Chinese approaches will exclude some\nEuropean philosophers that everyone would agree addressed metaphysics.\nThe choice of definitions is as much about rhetoric and power as the\nfacts. If \u201cmetaphysics\u201d labels the broader domain, then\nstudying metaphysics involves engaging other cultures. In contrast, if\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d labels a specifically European view, then\ncourses, books, and encyclopedia entries on metaphysics legitimately\nexclude other cultures. Aside from the political consequences of that\nexclusion, it obscures the many areas in which the traditions can be\nplaced in fruitful dialogue. Those factors support using an expansive\ndefinition of metaphysics, but applying \u201cmetaphysics\u201d to\nboth European and Chinese thought risks obscuring the differences\nbetween the two. More insidiously, it erodes these differences by\npresenting Chinese philosophy in European terms. That is a legitimate\nworry, but I think the greater danger is in ignoring what Chinese\nPhilosophy might contribute to discussions of metaphysics.\n\nIf we do take Chinese Philosophy as having metaphysics, we must strive\nto avoid distorting it to fit into European terms. One problem is in\nselecting topics. A simple approach would be to list the main topics\nin European metaphysics and then see what Chinese philosophers have to\nsay about them. The results would be disappointing, and this approach\nwould miss what is most interesting about a cross-cultural\nperspective, which is its ability to raise new questions. Within this\nentry, I have tried as much as possible to follow and explicate the\nmain issues that arose when Chinese philosophers were concerned with\nthe nature of reality. I have then made brief gestures toward how\nthese issues might connect to metaphysical problems in the European\ntradition.\n\nA second problem is with drawing boundaries. A label like\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d refers to certain human practices at the\nsame time that it draws boundaries around those practices. While\nChinese philosophers engaged in the kinds of practices that\nmetaphysics refers to, they did not draw the same boundaries.\nIsolating metaphysical inquiry from practices of self-cultivation, for\nexample, would have struck almost any Chinese philosopher as odd, if\nnot dangerous. There is no native Chinese term marking the same\nboundaries as \u201cmetaphysics\u201d in European philosophy. When\nChinese encountered the term, it was translated by way of Japanese as\nxing er shang xue \u5f62\u800c\u4e0a\u5b78,\nliterally, \u201cthe study of what is above forms.\u201d \u201cWhat\nis above forms\u201d had long been a central concept in Chinese\nphilosophy, originating in a passage from the \u201cXici\u201d\ncommentary on the Yi Jing \u6613\u7d93, the Classic\nof Changes, which says: \u201cWhat is above forms refers to the\nway [dao \u9053]; what is below forms refers to utensils\n[qi \u5668]\u201d (Gao Heng 1998,\n 407).[2]\n The distinction between what is above forms and what is below forms\nhas a vague resemblance to the distinction between metaphysics and\nphysics, but it is more specific (Zheng 2017; R. Wang 2015). The\ncontrast is between the formed and the formless. Both were taken to be\nimmanent in the world. They are two aspects of the processes of nature\nand would not be taken as distinct areas of inquiry. The implications\nof this view will appear across a range of metaphysical issues.\n2. Proto-Metaphysical Background: The Mandate of Heaven\n\nAs far as we know, explicit metaphysical discussions began in China in\nthe mid to late 4th century BCE with the Laozi\n(Daodejing) and associated texts. Before that, the two\ndominant philosophical movements were the Mohists and the Confucians\n(Ru). Both focused on political and ethical issues and showed little\ndirect concern with metaphysical questions, but their discussions of\nthe divine set the context for the emergence of metaphysical\ndebates.\n\nThe two most relevant concepts are tian \u5929 (heaven) and\nming \u547d (the command; fate). The idea of\ntianming \u5929\u547d (the \u201cMandate of\nHeaven\u201d) first came to prominence in rationalizing the conquest\nof the Shang dynasty by King Wen and King Wu, who founded the Zhou\ndynasty in the eleventh century BCE. Heaven is described in\nanthropomorphic terms as having awareness, preferences, and values.\nIts most fundamental concern is for the people, as expressed in a\nfamous line from the \u201cGreat Declaration\u201d chapter of the\nBook of Documents (Shangshu \u5c1a\u66f8):\n\u201cHeaven sees from where my people see; heaven hears from where\nmy people hear\u201d (quoted from Mengzi 5A5). As a\npolitical doctrine, the claim is that heaven will support rulers who\nhelp the people and will bring disaster on rulers who do not. On this\nview, the world works on consistent patterns that encompass ethical\nand political concerns. Human beings determine their own success or\nfailure based on these patterns rather than depending on divine whim.\nThe emergence of this view is commonly seen as a decisive moment in\nthe formation of Chinese philosophy.\n\nWhile heaven is presented as willful and anthropomorphic in the early\nparts of the Shangshu \u5c1a\u66f8, it was not\ntranscendent in the sense of being external to the system of nature.\nThe term tian simultaneously refers to the sky, the orderly\nmovement of the heavens, and something that covers all things equally.\nThe classical Chinese word for the \u201cworld\u201d or\n\u201crealm\u201d is literally what is \u201cunder-heaven\u201d,\ntianxia \u5929\u4e0b. Since the actions of heaven occur\nthrough the world, the two are often difficult to distinguish. The\nprimary expression of heaven\u2019s will is through human\nactions\u2014to lose heaven\u2019s mandate is to lose their support.\nThe eventual transition in conceptions of heaven from a willful deity\nto the causal patterns of nature was possible because heaven was never\nseparate from those patterns. Debates were about the nature of heaven\nrather than its existence, and heaven remained a central term for\nphilosophers holding widely different viewpoints.\n\nThe belief that heaven supported good rulers and punished the bad came\ninto question as the Zhou dynasty fell apart. Something like the\nclassical problem of evil arose as centuries of civil war and disaster\nmade it difficult to believe that the world was structured along\nethical lines (Perkins 2014). Three responses to this crisis can be\ndistinguished. One, exemplified by the Mohists, defended and theorized\nthe earlier view that heaven rewarded those who are good, defined as\nthose who care inclusively for other people. The second emphasized\nthat good and bad events come without reason and without concern for\njustice. This view was associated with a new meaning for\nming, taking it not as a command but as something more like\nblind fate. The third position argued for the regularity of natural\npatterns but took those patterns as amoral. On this view, human beings\nremain in control of their fate, but what brings success is not\nethical action, at least in a conventional sense. Versions of this\nview appears in the Laozi and in theories arising from\npractical arts like medicine or military strategy. While expressed in\ndifferent ways in different times, the belief that nature follows\nconsistent patterns that can guide human action became a dominant view\nacross Chinese philosophies, while the relationship between these\npatterns and humanistic values became one of the main points of\ndispute.\n3. The Cosmogonic Turn\n\nSometime probably in the middle of the fourth century BCE, a radical\nshift in vocabulary, concerns, and visions of the human took\n place.[3]\n This new position has long been known from the Laozi, but\nrecent archaeological discoveries show that the Laozi was\njust one of a number of positions that together constitute what we\nmight call \u201ca cosmogonic\n turn.\u201d[4]\n These texts are the first we know of to directly question how the\ndiverse things of the world arise and take form. This concern seems to\nhave been bound up with de-centering and de-privileging human beings.\nAs the Zhuangzi puts it:\n\n\nIn stating the number of things we say there are \u201cten\nthousand,\u201d and human beings are just one of them. [\u2026] In\ncomparison with the ten-thousand things, [human beings] are not even\nlike the tip of a hair to the body of a horse. (Guo 1978, 17: 564; cf.\nZiporyn 2009: 69)\n\n\nThis break with anthropocentrism went along with a shift away from\nhumanistic values like rightness (yi \u7fa9) or ritual\npropriety (li \u79ae) and toward concerns with maintaining\nlife, reducing desires, and acting spontaneously.\n\nThese cosmogonies share the following four assumptions:\n\nThe diverse things of the world ultimately trace back to a single\nsource.\nThe generation of things happens spontaneously, without design or\npurpose.\nThe ultimate is immanent in the world and can be accessed in some\nway.\nBetween the ultimate and the myriad concrete things, there are\nintermediary steps, particularly a role for polarities and cyclical\npatterns.\n\n\nAlmost every example of cosmogonic thinking in Chinese philosophy\nshares these characteristics, so I will discuss each in some\ndetail.\n3.1 Monism\n\nAll Chinese thinkers who discussed ultimate origins took that origin\nto be unique. The best known name for this source is dao\n\u9053, which means path, way, or guide. Another important name is\ntaiji \u592a\u6975, the \u201csupreme\n polarity.\u201d[5]\n The term taiji appears in the Yi Jing as the\noriginal unity from which yin and yang emerge. It\nremained an important term, particularly during the Confucian revival\nin the Song dynasty. Positing a single source had a decisive influence\non Chinese thought, as it implies an underlying unity and connection\nthat easily threatens differentiation and division (for the\nimplications of this idea of oneness, see Ivanhoe 2017 and Ivanhoe et.\nal. 2018). One of the most persistent metaphysical concerns is the\nontological status of difference and individuation (see Kwok 2016;\nPerkins 2015; Chai 2014a; Ziporyn 2013; Sim 2011; Fraser 2007; and Im\n2007). This orientation is the opposite of that in philosophies based\non dualisms or ontologically independent substances, views that were\ndominant through most of European intellectual history. We can say\nthat European metaphysics has tended to focus on problems of\nreconciliation (how ontologically distinct things can interact),\nwhile Chinese metaphysics has been more concerned with problems of\ndistinction (what grounds individuation).\n\nThere is some ambiguity in saying that the ultimate origin is one.\nChapter 42 of the Laozi says that \u201cthe one\u201d\n(yi \u4e00) generates two, which generates three and then\nthe myriad things, but claims that the one itself is not ultimate. It\nis generated from dao. Chapter 40 says that things are born\nfrom being [you \u6709], but being is generated from\nno-being [wu \u7121]. This reflects one of the earliest\nmetaphysical debates\u2014is this unitary origin a thing? There seems\nto have been advocates for each side, but the view that came to\ndominate is given as a principle in the Zhuangzi: \u201cwhat\nthings things is not itself a thing\u201d (wuwuzhe feiwu\n\u7269\u7269\u8005\u975e\u7269) (Guo 1978, 22: 763; cf.\nZiporyn 2009: 91).\n\nThe terms you \u6709 and wu \u7121 are among the\nmost important metaphysical terms in the Chinese tradition (see Jing\nLiu 2017; Chai 2014b; B. Wang 2011; Cheng 2009; Bai 2008; and the\nessays in Liu and Berger 2014). They are often translated as\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cnon-being\u201d, but wu\nrefers not to radical nothingness but to the lack of differentiated\nbeings. Thus in the context of the Laozi, Hans-Georg Moeller\n(2007) translates the two terms as \u201cpresence\u201d and\n\u201cnon-presence\u201d, Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall (2003)\ntranslate them as \u201cdeterminate\u201d and\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d, and Brook Ziporyn (2014) as\n\u201cbeing-there\u201d and \u201cnot-being-there\u201d.\n\nTaking the ultimate as no-thing places it at or beyond the limits of\nlanguage. How to speak of the ultimate without making it into an\nobject or thing became another persistent philosophical issue. The\nZhuangzi points out that as soon as you label something, even\nas no-being (wu), it becomes a thing that needs its own\nexplanation:\n\n\nThere is being, there is no-being, there is not yet beginning to be\nno-being, there is not yet beginning to be not yet beginning to be\nno-being. (Guo 1978, 2: 79; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 15)\n\n\nThis dialectic between being and no-being was later taken up in a\ndifferent form through Buddhist debates about emptiness, and it can be\nconsidered one of the central metaphysical problems throughout the\nChinese philosophical tradition.\n3.2 Spontaneous Generation\n\nIf we take no-being as indeterminacy, then the problem of a first\ncause is not getting many from one nor getting something from nothing\nbut rather how differentiation emerges from the undifferentiated. The\ncommon explanation appeals to another key metaphysical\nconcept\u2014ziran \u81ea\u7136. The character\nzi \u81ea is a reflexive pronoun, and ran \u7136\nmeans to be in a certain way. Thus ziran means to be\nso-of-oneself or to be \u201cself-so\u201d (for a thorough\ndiscussion, see Bruya 2022). Ziran excludes appeals to\npurpose, deliberation or design, and the rise of the term paralleled a\ndisplacement of heaven by terms such as dao. Using\nziran to explain how things arise may seem like an evasion,\nnot much different from replying, \u201cthat\u2019s just how it\nis.\u201d If we are to avoid an infinite regress of causes, though,\nthe only possibility is to stop at something that just is the way it\nis from its own being. The role of ziran (self-so) is similar\nto the role of causa sui (self-caused) in European\nphilosophy. While classical European metaphysics attempts to isolate\nself-causality in a transcendent God, the Chinese took it as the very\nnature of existence. In this approach, there are similarities with\nSpinoza\u2019s identification of being and conatus\n(striving) and even with Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cwill to\npower\u201d.\n\nTwo important points follow. First, existence is seen not in terms of\nabstract being but rather as sheng \u751f: life, growth,\nbirth, vitality. The fundamental role of sheng appears\nexplicitly in the \u201cXici\u201d commentary on the Yi\nJing, which says that the foundation of the Changes is\nshengsheng, \u201cgenerating and generating\u201d,\n\u201cgrowing and growing\u201d, \u201cliving and living\u201d, or\n\u201cnatura naturans\u201d (Gao Heng 1998: 388). This\nphrase inspired the famous description of nature as shengsheng\nbuxi \u751f\u751f\u4e0d\u606f: generating, generating,\nnever ceasing! It is sometimes said that Chinese philosophy lacks\nontology (and thus metaphysics) because philosophers were never\nconcerned with being as such. It is more accurate to say that Chinese\nphilosophers took dynamic organization as implicit in the very nature\nof being, rather than positing an external source for motion and\norder. This means that ontology is also cosmology, even biology.\n\nSecond, if spontaneous generation is the very nature of being, then\none can legitimately attribute ziran to both the ultimate and\nto things themselves. Chapter 25 of the Laozi says,\n\u201cHuman beings follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows\ndao, dao follows ziran\u201d, but chapter\n64 speaks of \u201cthe ziran of the myriad things\u201d,\nand in chapter 17, the people refer to their own ziran. This\nimmanence contrasts with the common division between God as\nself-caused and everything else as caused by God, a view which\nultimately sees being as divided into two fundamentally different\nkinds. In employing a univocal conception of being as sheng,\nChinese philosophies did not segregate self-generation from the\nworld.\n3.3 Immanence\n\nThe third common point is that the ultimate is immanent in the world.\nVerbs in classical Chinese are not modified for tense, and this\nintroduces a fundamental ambiguity into all of these\ncosmogonies\u2014while they can be read as describing something that\nhappened in the past, they can just as well describe an ongoing\nprocess in which the generative function is always present. In one\npassage, Zhuangzi is asked where dao is and he replies that\nthere is no place from which dao is absent. Pushed to give an\nexample, he says dao is in ants and crickets. When asked to\ngo lower, Zhuangzi says dao is in weeds, broken tiles, and\neven in piss and dung (Guo 1978, 22: 750; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 89).\nSimilar statements would later be made about Buddha-nature,\nparticularly in the tradition of Chan \u79aa (Zen) Buddhism. The\nimmanence of the source is demonstrated most of all by the fact that\nit remains accessible to cultivated people. In the Laozi,\ndao is something one can use in the world:\n\n\nDao is constantly without name. Although in its unhewn\nsimplicity it is minute, heaven and earth do not dare subordinate it.\nIf princes and kings can preserve it, the ten thousand things will\nmake themselves their guests. (Ch 32)\n\n\nIt is difficult to find the right language to describe the\nrelationship between dao and human beings. The dao\nis not external and it is not an object that could be grasped, so it\nis not a matter of getting or reaching it. Since the self-so\nspontaneity to which dao refers is always present, what is\nrequired is a negative process of removing obstacles. Ziran\nis what remains if we free ourselves from striving and conventional\ngoals. Thus this same process is described as wuwei\n\u7121\u70ba, which literally means \u201clacking action\u201d\nbut refers to giving up actions that are coercive, effortful, or\nforced. The Zhuangzi describes this process as the\n\u201cfasting of the heart/mind\u201d (xinzhai\n\u5fc3\u9f4b), which allows us to rely directly on vital energy\n(qi) and respond spontaneously to whatever appears before us\n(Guo 1978, 4: 147; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 26).\n3.4 Polarity and Cycles\n\nAll of the cosmogonies posit stages between the ultimate and the\nconcrete myriad things of the world. If the ultimate ground of things\nis immanent rather than teleological, then concrete things must be\nexplained through a gradual process of spontaneous differentiation.\nHaving a series of stages also allows for degrees of differentiation\nwithin a connected whole. That provides an explanation not just for\nthings, but also for nature as a system.\n\nThe most common stage involves interaction between two forces. These\npolar forces could be specified in many ways\u2014heaven and earth,\nhot and cold, dry and moist\u2014but the pair that came to dominate\nis yin \u9670 and yang\u967d. (For a thorough\nstudy of yin and yang, see R. Wang 2012.)\nYang originally referred to the south side of a mountain,\nwhich received the sun, while yin referred to the north side.\nUltimately, yang was associated with the masculine, the\nforceful, and the bright, while yin was associated with the\nfeminine, the yielding, and the obscure. Creativity followed from the\ninteraction of yin and yang, analogous to sexual\nreproduction.\n\nAll of the cosmogonies include cycles and processes of return. One\nprominent model was the four seasons. The change of seasons places\ncycles of growth and decay into a broader context of continuous\nvitality. The change of seasons itself, though, was seen as expressing\na more fundamental cycle between poles such as yin and\nyang. Cyclical change could also be theorized through the\nprogressions of generation (sheng \u751f) or overcoming\n(ke \u514b) among the five phases (wuxing\n\u4e94\u884c): wood, earth, fire, water, and metal. Another\nversion of this cycling between poles was the claim that when\nprocesses reach an extreme, they reverse. Yet another manifestation is\nthat things emerge from a common source and ultimately return to that\nsource. In all of these cases, cyclicality explains the sustainability\nand predictability of natural patterns.\n4. Impartiality and Differentiation\n\nNo pre-Buddhist Chinese philosophers claimed that the qualitatively\ndifferentiated world we experience is an illusion, but their monistic\nmetaphysics privileged connectedness and unity. While patterns of\ndifferentiation may be objective, individuation\n(i.e., what counts as a thing) is provisional and contextual. It is\nalways possible to view all things as forming one whole or one body,\nand this unity tends toward equalizing things. From our contextual\npoint of view, one thing can be said to be bigger, better, or more\nbeautiful than another, but from a broader perspective all things have\nthe same status as parts of a single body. This could lead toward\nskepticism of absolute values (as in the Zhuangzi) or toward\nan imperative to care for all things. Hui Shi (c. 380\u2013305 BCE)\nis reported to have said: \u201cCare overflowingly for all the myriad\nthings; heaven and earth form one body [yiti\n\u4e00\u9ad4]\u201d (Guo 1978, 33: 1102; Ziporyn 2009: 124). This\ncan be seen as a radicalization of the Mohist claim that heaven\ngenerates all human beings and thus cares for them all equally, a\npoint rooted in the early Zhou view of heaven as protecting the\npeople. A progression toward more and more radical impartiality is\nmapped out in a passage from the L\u00fcshi chunqiu\n\u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb, a text compiled around 239 BCE. The\npassage begins with a statement of nature\u2019s impartiality:\n\n\nThe world is not one person\u2019s world but the world\u2019s world.\nThe harmony of yinyang does not grow just one type. Sweet dew\nand timely rain are not partial to one thing. The birth of the myriad\npeoples does not favor one person.\n\n\nThis is followed by story contrasting Kongzi (Confucius) and Lao Dan\n(Laozi):\n\n\nA person of Jing lost a bow and was not willing to search for it,\nsaying, \u201cA person of Jing lost it, a person of Jing will find\nit, so why search?\u201d Kongzi heard this and said, \u201cIf you\nleave out \u2018Jing,\u2019 then it is acceptable\u201d. Lao Dan\nheard it and said, \u201cIf you leave out \u2018person,\u2019 then\nit is acceptable.\u201d Thus it was Lao Dan who reached the utmost\nimpartiality. (Chen Qiyou 1984, 1/4:\n 45)[6]\n\n\nThe level of impartiality attributed to Laozi eliminates the\npossibility of loss, leading to equanimity.\n\nAs the reference to Kongzi suggests, this tendency toward inclusivity\nthreatened the humanistic ethics of the Confucians. Their main\nresponse addressed a gap in the cosmogonies exemplified by the\nLaozi. These cosmogonies explained the dynamism inherent in\nparticular things and the broader patterns of nature, but they did not\naddress the differences between kinds of things\u2014what makes human\nbeings differ consistently from dogs? The concept that arose to fill\nthis gap and to justify Confucian humanism is xing \u6027.\nXing is most often translated as the \u201cnature\u201d of\na thing or kind of thing, but it refers specifically to the way a\nthing responds spontaneously to its environment. In human beings,\nxing manifests itself primarily as desires and emotions,\nbroadly labeled as qing \u60c5 (genuine affects). One of\nthe key questions debated by the Confucians was the degree to which\nethical concerns like care, respect, and shame were embedded in these\nnatural spontaneous affects.\n\nXing became a foundation for theories of motivation but its\nroots are in metaphysics. Xing derives from heaven and is\nclosely connected to sheng \u751f, the term meaning to live\nor generate. Xing moves from the generic creativity or\nvitality of nature to the specific life processes of kinds of things.\nMore concretely, xing was conceptualized as the dynamic flow\nof qi (vital energy). One recently discovered text from the\nlate 4th century BCE (known as the Xing zi ming\nchu \u6027\u81ea\u547d\u51fa) brings these levels\ntogether:\n\n\nAlthough all human beings have xing, the heart lacks a stable\nresolve. It awaits things and then stirs, awaits being pleased and\nthen acts, awaits practice and then stabilizes. The vital energies\n(qi \u6c23) of pleasure, anger, grief, and sadness are\nxing. Their appearing on the outside is because things\nstimulate them. Xing comes out from what is allotted\n(ming) and what is allotted comes down from heaven\n(tian). (S. Cook 2012, 697\u2013700, slips 1\u20133).\n\n\nThe term qi, translated here as \u201cvital energy\u201d,\nis already well known in English. It was originally taken as one of\nseveral kinds of stuff, connected with air and breath, but it\neventually became the dominant label for the basic stuff of the world,\nused to explain all kinds of dynamic processes, from the formation of\nheaven and earth to patterns of weather to the processes of the human\n heart.[7]\n It was closely connected with life and the generative power of\nnature. In this passage, human affects (including desires and a\ntendency to approve or disapprove) are the movement of this\nqi when stimulated by events in the world. This is part of\nthe Confucian response to the focus on wuwei and reducing\ndesires in texts like the Laozi and\nZhuangzi\u2014affects like sorrow and care arise\nspontaneously, by ziran. They are as natural for human beings\nas it is for water to flow downward or for trees to grow toward the\nsun.\n\nIt may seem that this topic has drifted from metaphysics into ethics,\nbut human actions are not different in kind from the movements of\nother things in the world, and human motivation expresses the tendency\ntoward growth inherent in the very nature of existence. The use of\nxing and ziran in relation to motivation differs\nfrom the concerns around free will in almost every way, but they all\narise as ways of explaining how human choices relate to the forces\ndriving change in the rest of the natural world, or even how human\nchoices relate to the very nature of being. In this way, they unite\nmetaphysics and ethics.\n\nBeyond its role in explaining motivation, xing helps explain\nthe organization of the world into individuals and kinds. In a series\nof passages arguing with a rival named Gaozi, Mengzi shows that\nwhatever would explain the natures of things must have its own\ndynamism and directionality, and it must explain the specific\ndifferences between kinds of things (6A1\u20133). On the one side,\nxing differentiates things in terms of coherent patterns of\nforce, providing a contextual and provisional basis for individuation.\nOne can refer to the xing of a human being but also the\nxing of the human mouth (6A7), to the xing of a\nmountain ecosystem (6A8) or the xing of a single tree (6A1).\nOn the other side, xing was generally used as a species\nconcept\u2014things of the same kind have the same xing.\nMengzi\u2019s ethical philosophy is based on his belief that human\nbeings share certain ways of responding to the world, all having the\nsame xing. The status of species, though, was a point of\ncontroversy, linked to the question of whether or not all human beings\ncould be held to the same standards. A more radical line of thought\ntook each individual as having its own unique xing, a view\nrooted in parts of the Zhuangzi and developed later by Guo\nXiang (?\u2013312 CE) (Chiu forthcoming).\n5. Correlative Cosmology\n\nNear the end of the Warring States Period, new assumptions about\ncosmology and metaphysics appeared that dominated the Han dynasty and\nprofoundly influenced the development of Chinese thought. This new\nview has come to be known as \u201ccorrelative cosmology,\u201d but\nit was not a single cosmology as much as several cosmological\nprinciples (Brindley 2012,\n 2\u20133).[8]\n Its core elements are various schema for sorting phenomena into kinds\n(lei \u985e) and a theory of causality based on stimulus\nand response (ganying \u611f\u61c9). These elements\nappear together in a paradigmatic statement from the L\u00fcshi\nchunqiu:\n\n\nThings of the same kind summon each other, those with the same vital\nenergy join together, and sounds that match resonate. Thus if you\nstrum a gong note other gong will resonate; if you\nstrum a jue note other jue will vibrate. Use a\ndragon to bring rain; use the form to move the shadow. The masses of\npeople think that fortune and misfortune come from fate\n[ming]. How could they know from where they truly come! (Chen\nQiyou 1984, 20/4: 1369)\n\n\nThe categories used could be more or less specific, so on one side\nmight be \u201chuman being\u201d or \u201canimal\u201d while on\nthe most general side all things could be classified as either\nyin or yang. Another of the most common categories\nwere wood, earth, fire, water, and metal, known as the five phases\n(wuxing). Yet another set were based on the Yi Jing,\nusing either the eight trigrams or sixty-four hexagrams. These systems\nof categorization were eventually integrated, so that categories from\none could be translated into the others. Given the underlying ontology\nof change and process, categorization is not based on inherent\nqualities or essences but on typical ways of acting and\nreacting\u2014does it tend to expand or contract, work gradually or\nswiftly, manifest itself obviously or subtly? Since these traits are\nrelational, the same \u201cthing\u201d may not always be in the same\ncategory (it might act like wood in one context but metal in another),\nand because they are dynamic, the categories give immediate\ninformation on how things can be controlled, directed, or diminished.\nThe application of the categories depends on context and the context\ndepends on our particular purposes, but they are meant to express real\nproperties of things.\n\nConsider the use of the most general categories, yin and\nyang. Yang labels the tendency to expand and\ndominate; yin labels the tendency to draw things in by\nyielding. Anything can be put in one of these two categories, but\nyin and yang are not inherent properties. The same\nthing that might be active and dominating in one relationship might be\nsofter and yielding in another (as is commonly the case in Chinese\nmedicine). The function of the labels can be compared to the way we\nlabel cause and effect. We can designate a cause and an effect in any\nchange, but being a cause is not an essential property. Everything is\nsimultaneously the cause of many effects and the effect of many\ncauses. As cause and effect illustrate, even a set of binary\ncategories can be helpful in analyzing situations, and\nyinyang could be specified in various ways. In the Yi\nJing, lines representing either yin (a divided line) or\nyang (a straight line) can be combined into groups of three\nto form eight trigrams, or groups of six to form 64 categories. Each\nof these lines could be taken as more or less stable, leading to 4096\npossible situations.\n\nThe conception of causality at work here has come to be labeled with\nthe Chinese phrase ganying \u611f\u61c9, \u201cstimulus\nand response\u201d. This way of approaching causality reflects the\nfact that existence is inherently active and dynamic: nothing is\npurely passive or inert. The effects of a stimulus depend on the\nreceptive and responsive capacities of the thing stimulated. One\ncommon model for ganying was resonance, as in the quotation\nabove where the vibrations of one string stimulate vibrations in\nstrings tuned to the same note.\n\nThe final element is the role of correlations. To place phenomena in\nthe same category is to situate them as having similar functions in\nanalogous configurations. To be yin is to have a relationship\nto something that is yang, to be wood-like is to stand in\ncertain relationships to fire, metal, earth, and water. This way of\ncategorizing allows correlations across what would seem to be very\ndifferent kinds of things. For example, an illness that is\nyang (expansive or overactive) can be treated with foods that\nare yin (receptive or calming). This kind of thinking is\nrooted in a concern for acting in harmony with natural patterns, going\nback to the concept of shi \u6642, which refers to the\nseasons, to the temporal configuration of a given moment, and to the\nability to act according to the demands of that moment (Sellman 2002).\nThese correlations were based on empirical observations, but as the\ncategories were integrated and extended to all phenomena, the\nconnections become less and less apparent, sometimes seeming forced\nand arbitrary. For example, for the first month that starts spring,\nthe L\u00fcshi chunqiu correlates certain days of the month,\nscaly animals, the musical note jue, sour tastes, and the\nnumber eight, but it also recommends surveying the land to set the\nboundaries of fields (so that conflicts are settled before planting\nbegins), bans killing young animals and destroying eggs (so as to\navoid shortages later), and forbids conscripting groups for war or\nmajor construction (so that they have time to plant the fields) (Chen\nQiyou 1984, 1/1: 1\u20132). These are essentially rules for\nsustainability.\n\nThe model that dominated modern European thinking about\ncausality\u2014linear causality through collision (on the model of\nbilliard balls)\u2014was not central to Chinese reflections on\ncausality (as it was not central in Europe before the late\nRenaissance). For Chinese philosophers, the paradigms for causality\nwere things like the effects of music over a distance, the\nrelationship between spring and the growth of plants, and the\ninfluence between a teacher and student. This orientation followed\nfrom belief that all things are interconnected and are ultimately\ncomposed of the same stuff, qi. It also reflected practical\nconcerns\u2014How does culture work so that people can live together\nharmoniously? How do we relate to nature in a way that is sustainable?\nApproaching causality from this direction, though, is notoriously\ndifficult. Han dynasty philosophers were basically starting from what\nwe might now call ecological thinking or theories of complexity.\n\nCorrelative cosmology posited a systematically ordered universe whose\npatterns could be grasped and mastered. The earlier quote from the\nL\u00fcshi chunqiu ends with a powerful message: people think\nsome things happen without reason or cause, attributing it to fate,\nbut they are wrong. Nothing happens without a cause, and the system of\ncauses can be known and controlled. This view placed human beings in\ncontrol of their fates.\n\nThe elevation of human power appears in the way the system of\ncorrelations provided a metaphysical foundation for what would seem to\nbe human constructs. One early example was the correlation of leniency\nand violence (or the civil, wen \u6587, and the martial,\nwu \u6b66) with the spring and the fall. This correlation\nmade the use of violence a necessary and natural principle, while also\nrestricting it to certain times. The paradigm for justifying social\norder through correlations is the Chunqiu fanlu\n\u6625\u79cb\u7e41\u9732, traditionally attributed to Dong\nZhongshu (179\u2013104 BCE). In this text, yin and\nyang remain complementary but shift from equal forces driving\ngeneration to markers for hierarchical positions in a system of\ncorrelated arrangements (R. Wang 2005). To give just one example:\n\n\nThe righteous [relationships] between ruler and minister, husband and\nwife, and father and son all derive from the Way of yin and yang. The\nruler is yang; the minister is yin. The father is yang; the son is\nyin. The husband is yang; the wife is yin. There are no places where\nthe Way of yin circulates alone. At the beginning [of the yearly\ncycle], yin is not permitted to arise by itself. Likewise, at the end\n[of the yearly cycle], yin is not permitted to share in [the glories]\nof yang\u2019s achievements. Such is the righteous principle of\n\u201cjoining.\u201d Thus, the minister joins his achievements to\nthe lord; the son joins his achievements to the father; the wife joins\nher achievements to the husband; yin joins its achievements to yang;\nand Earth joins its achievements to Heaven (trans. from Queen and\nMajor 2016, 426\u201327)\n\n\nThis cosmology ends up doing much of the work that was done by\nanthropomorphism in the European tradition. In both cases, human\nculture is seen as mirroring structures at the foundation of the\nnatural world. In the case of Europe, that foundation is seen as\nhuman-like in that we are made in the image of God, thus\nanthropomorphizing nature. In Chinese correlative cosmology, the\nopposite occurs, where specifically human phenomena are theorized as\nnatural. In both cases, social and political hierarchies are given a\nmetaphysical basis. The fact that similar oppressive hierarchies were\nrationalized and naturalized by radically different metaphysical views\nsuggests the ease with which metaphysics comes to serve the interests\nof power.\n\nHan dynasty philosophy could still be quite critical. The elevation of\nyang over yin in the Chunqiu fanlu is\npartly driven by a desire to minimize state violence, which it\ncorrelates with yin. A more radical political alternative\nappears in the Huainanzi \u6dee\u5357\u5b50, a text\ncompiled around 139 BCE. The Huainanzi emphasizes the\ninherent tendency of being toward diversification. Correlative\ninfluences generate a world that is too complex to grasp or master;\npolitically, that justifies decentralization, minimal state power, and\nthe value of diversity. Later in the Han dynasty, Wang Chong\n\u738b\u5145 (27\u2013100 CE) offers more fundamental criticisms,\nemphasizing the limits of human power to control and predict natural\nphenomena, the disjunction between virtue and worldly success, and the\narbitrariness of explanations in terms of categories like the five\nphases. This argument is grounded in metaphysics. Wang Chong\nexplicitly argues against beliefs that the world is ordered according\nto anything like a human design, claiming instead that everything\narises spontaneously, by ziran (see McLeod 2019; Henderson\n1984, 97\u2013101).\n\nThe Han dynasty collapsed in 220 CE, leading to a long period of\nfragmentation, instability, and uncertainty. The dominant\nphilosophical movement is known as Xuanxue \u7384\u5b78,\n\u201cProfound Learning.\u201d The term xuan means dark,\nobscure, or profound, but it also has a sense of what precedes any\ndivision, as it is used in the first chapter of the Laozi.\nThe best known works from this movement are the commentaries by Wang\nBi (226\u2013249) (on the Laozi and Yi Jing) and by\nGuo Xiang (?\u2013312 CE) (on the\n Zhuangzi).[9]\n Because of the centrality of the Laozi and\nZhuangzi, the movement is sometimes known in English as\n\u201cNeo-Daoism.\u201d Different philosophers held different\npositions, but the core metaphysical issue was how to understand\ndao as ultimate ground, particularly how to interpret\ndescriptions of dao as no-being (wu \u7121) and\nhow to understand the relations between dao and the concrete\nworld of experience.\n\nXuanxue was important for establishing the metaphysical\nvocabulary used in later Chinese philosophy. One of the most important\nterms is li \u7406, which in its original use was a verb\nfor laying out borders according to the contours of the land, or for\ncarving jade according to its own inherent structure. Both Wang Bi and\nGuo Xiang use li as a technical term\u2014for Wang Bi\nli refers to the patterns of coherence represented by the\nhexagrams of the Yi Jing, while for Guo Xiang li\nrefers to patterns of differentiation that spontaneously arise in the\nworld (Ziporyn 2014: 137\u201384). Li was later used by\nChinese Buddhists to refer to emptiness and by Neo-Confucians to refer\nto patterns of coherence. The latter is discussed in Section 7.\n\nA second key concept to arise is the pairing of ti \u9ad4\nand yong \u7528 (see Ziporyn 2014: 149\u2013155; Zhang\n2002: 252\u201353; Cua 2002; Cheng 2002). Yong means use or\nfunction. Ti originally refers to an organized form, a\npattern that can be recognized, or to a body or part of the body. The\npairing of tiyong was applied in different ways, but what is\nmost consistent through these uses is that ti is singular and\nyong is multiple. For example, the same piece of wood\n(ti) could have many different uses (yong): to fuel\na fire, to build a house, to carve into bowls, and so on. As in this\nexample, the multiplicity of yong comes through involvement\nin concrete circumstances or purposes. In this way, ti is\nusually less determinate than yong. In fact, the ultimate\nti was generally taken as fully indeterminate, thus allowing\nfor infinite determinate uses (yong). The contrast between\nti and yong sometimes looks like a contrast between\nthe thing itself and the various ways it can be used. Such a contrast\nis highlighted in the translation of ti as substance, but\nthis translation is misleading in several ways. First, like\nyin and yang, the labels ti and\nyong are contextual and thus the very same thing might be\nconsidered as ti in one context but as yong in\nanother. Second, the ultimate ti is almost never taken to be\nindividuated\u2014it is emptiness or vital energy or the patterns of\ncoherence (li) that all things share. So, individuation\noccurs more on the level of yong than ti. It is\nworth noting that the phrase chosen to translate the ontos in\nontology was benti \u672c\u9ad4, literally the\n\u201croot\u201d ti, a term that was prominent in\nNeo-Confucianism.\n6. Buddhist Metaphysics in China\n\nA radical transformation of metaphysical views in China followed the\nintroduction and incorporation of Buddhist philosophy, a process that\nbegan in the 1st century CE. On the surface, one might\nthink that Buddhism opposes metaphysical speculation. In the famous\nparable of the arrow, the Buddha compares a student insistent on\nmetaphysical speculation to someone who has been shot with a poisoned\narrow but refuses to be treated until he knows who shot the arrow, why\nthey shot it, where the arrow came from, and so on. The point is that\nwe know that the central problem in life is suffering and we know that\nthe cure is the elimination of self-centered desires. Nonetheless,\nBuddhists commonly claim that one can be released from such desires by\nseeing reality as it truly is. The truth to be realized is that there\nis no self as an independent and lasting being. Much of Buddhist\nphilosophy can be read as a sustained attack on any kind of\nsubstance-based metaphysics. The existence of substances (and thus of\nthe self as a real and lasting thing) requires three things:\nontological separation between things (making the self distinct from\nothers), internal unity (so that it is one self), and\nsameness over time (so it remains the same self). Buddhists\nattack all three of these, arguing that things are interconnected,\nlack intrinsic unity, and change endlessly. Their arguments invoke two\nof the main principles of Buddhist metaphysics\u2014impermanence\n(anitya/wuchang \u7121\u5e38) and dependent\nco-arising (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da/yuanqi\n\u7de3\u8d77).\n\nThe process oriented metaphysics of Buddhism fit with the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition, but it brought a level of precision and\ncomplexity honed through a long tradition of intense disputation and\ndialectic. Positions that had been taken for granted in China were\narticulated in detail and defended against alternatives that had never\nbeen a concern (such as the idea of an eternal and unchanging soul).\nNew possibilities were introduced, including the claim that only\nconsciousness is real. Of course, as Buddhism impacted Chinese\nphilosophy, China transformed Buddhism, leading to schools of Buddhism\nthat never existed in India. Buddhist metaphysics in China is complex\nand diverse and I will just focus a few\n examples.[10]\n\nMuch of Buddhist metaphysics involves negotiating a middle ground\nbetween reification and nihilism. The problem appears in relation to\nthe self\u2014it may be true that there is no self, but surely there\nis something which grounds or generates or is the illusion of self.\nOne early school (Abhidharma) argued the self is a label for what is\nreally an aggregate of momentary elements and factors, known as\ndharmas (fa \u6cd5). Apparent wholes like the self\ncan be mereologically reduced to constituent factors, just as a\nchariot can be reduced to its parts. A more radical view extended the\ncritique of the self to any entity that might be taken as\nindependently real or self-defined, in Buddhist terms, anything that\nmight have svabh\u0101va, literally \u201cself-being\u201d\nor \u201cself-nature\u201d (in Chinese, zixing\n\u81ea\u6027). This denial of self-being follows from dependent\nco-arising, which claims that any event depends on and is bound up\nwith others. Lacking an independent essence or ground, all phenomena\nare said to be empty, \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 or kong\n\u7a7a. Emptiness is meant to be a middle ground between affirming\nor denying the existence of things, but such a middle ground is\ndifficult to articulate, and the history of Buddhist philosophy can be\nseen as a dialectic between those proposing some kind of reality\n(accused of reification) and those rejecting it (accused of\nnihilism).\n\nThis dialectic is portrayed differently by different thinkers,\ndepending on what they take to be the final position that encompasses\nall others. As an example, we can consider the progression given by\nZongmi \u5b97\u5bc6 (780\u2013841), a philosopher representative\nof the Huayan \u83ef\u56b4 school but with close links to Chan\n(see Gregory 2002). In his Inquiry into the Origins of\nHumanity (Yuanren lun \u539f\u4eba\u8ad6) Zongmi\nbegins with the view that each person has a soul that is reincarnated\naccording to his or her actions. He critiques this position by\nanalyzing this self in terms of its parts\u2014the self cannot be\nidentified with the totality of parts (since some parts are lost at\ndeath) nor with one part among many (which would make the other parts\nirrelevant and thus not really even parts). This leads into the next\nposition, that\n\n\nbodily form and cognitive mind, because of the force of causes and\nconditions, arise and perish from moment to moment, continuing in a\nseries without cease, like the trickling of water or the flame of a\nlamp. (trans. from Gregory 2009: 143)\n\n\nAccording to Zongmi, this denial of the self cannot account for\ncontinuity, and in particular, the links between actions and\nconsequences (karma). Some medium must hold the various elements\ntogether. That leads into the third position, that all the various\nchanges are appearances of one mind, which is the ultimate reality.\nThis was the position of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra or Consciousness-Only\n(weishi \u552f\u8b58) school of Buddhism.\n\nThe claim that mind is the ultimate reality tends back toward the side\nof reification and so the next step negates it. Zongmi\u2019s\nargument is typical of the Madhyamaka school (commonly known in\nChinese as the \u201cThree Teachings,\u201d Sanlun\n\u4e09\u8ad6). If we identify this one mind with actual thoughts,\nthen either both are illusions or both are real, but if we separate\nthis mind from actual thoughts then we end up with thoughts that exist\non their own and a mind that has no qualities whatsoever. While the\ntarget here is mind as the ultimate reality, a similar argument can be\nused to attack anything claimed to be independent and unchanging. For\nZongmi, this position denies any form of being and so it cannot end\nthe dialectic. He calls the fifth and final position \u201cThe\nTeaching that Reveals the Nature,\u201d reinterpreting a term we have\nalready seen, xing \u6027, which here stands for the\nBuddha-nature (Fo xing \u4f5b\u6027). This ultimate\nreality could also be referred to as the true mind or as the\nTath\u0101gatagarbha (Rulaizang\u5982\u4f86\u81e7),\nwhich literally means the \u201cWomb of the Thus-Come\u201d\n(\u201cThus-Come\u201d being a common name for the Buddha).\n\nWhile the last three positions all had prominent advocates in China,\nthe final position became dominant and was shared by Tiantai\n\u5929\u81fa, Huayan, and Chan Buddhists. One obvious question is\nhow this final position differs from the position of\nConsciousness-Only. Zongmi extends a line of argument common in\nChinese Buddhism, which is to critique any form of dualism. Since\nnothing we experience is truly independent, simple, or unchanging, any\nmetaphysics that posits substances with self-being requires a\nbifurcation between reality and appearances, or more specifically,\nbetween the substance itself and the various qualities or modes by\nwhich it appears. Buddhists argue against the coherence of any such\ndivision. This is the meaning of the common saying: \u201cform is\nemptiness and emptiness is form.\u201d Zongmi pushes this argument\nfurther to argue against any split between reality and illusion or\nbetween enlightenment and non-enlightenment. This leads to the claim\nthat all sentient beings are already enlightened\u2014what is needed\nis not to change reality or gain anything but just to realize that we\nare already where we need to be.\n\nThe relationship between reality and illusion is one of the central\ndebates within Chinese Buddhism (Kantor 2015). The most famous\nexpression of this debate appears in the Platform Sutra of the\nSixth Patriarch, a foundational text for Chan Buddhism. The star\ndisciple (Shen Xiu) first composes this poem:\n\n\nThe body is the tree of insight;\n\nThe mind is like a clear mirror.\n\nAlways clean and polish it;\n\nNever allow dirt or dust!\n\n\nHui Neng (638\u2013713 CE), the central figure of the text, writes\nthis poem in reply:\n\n\nInsight originally has no tree;\n\nThe bright mirror has no stand.\n\nBuddha-nature is always pure and clean;\n\nHow could there ever be dirt or dust? (trans. from Ivanhoe 2009,\n15\u201316)\n\n\nThe contrast between the two poems marks the split between the gradual\nand sudden enlightenment schools of Chan.\n\nHow to discuss the relationship between the realm of experience and\nemptiness or Buddha-nature was another common theme in Chinese\nBuddhist philosophy. One of the more thorough and influential\ndiscussions is the Meditative Approaches to the Huayan\nDharmadh\u0101tu (Huayan Fajie Guan Men\n\u83ef\u56b4\u6cd5\u754c\u89c0\u9580), attributed to\nDushun \u675c\u9806 (557\u2013640) (see Fox 2009). According to\nDushun, the world of experience can be viewed in four different ways.\nThe first is as phenomena or events (shi \u4e8b), which is\nequivalent to the realm of form. The second is as emptiness, referred\nto here with the term li \u7406. The point is that, in one\nsense, reality can be seen as the multitude of phenomena but, in\nanother sense, it can all be seen as empty, which entails a kind of\nequality and interchangeability. The third perspective addresses the\nrelationship between emptiness and phenomena, using the relationship\nbetween water and waves as a metaphor. The two are mutually\nencompassing and mutually dependent, just as there is no water without\nwaves and waves are nothing other than water, yet we can focus solely\non the wave or solely on the water. The point is that designating a\nwave is not the same as designating water, yet these designations do\nnot \u201cobstruct\u201d each other. The very same reality can be\ntaken as the phenomena of everyday experience and as emptiness.\n\nThe fourth perspective brings us to a metaphysical issue that has\nrecurred across the Chinese philosophical tradition\u2014the\ninterconnection of things. It is not just that emptiness and phenomena\nare mutually penetrating but that any phenomenon is penetrated by all\nothers. The claim that any one thing includes all others is clearest\non the level of causality and intelligibility. Consider the cause for\nyour reading this article. It might be for help in a course, or\nbecause you followed a link out of curiosity, or from a desire to\nbetter understand the context of the Laozi. But we could say\nthe cause was the story of how your parents met\u2014had that not\nhappened you would not be reading this article. Or it might be the\nstory of how my parents met, or the creation of the internet, or the\nfounding of Stanford University, or the gravitational pull of the\nearth. If everything is interconnected, then anything could be given\nas a cause for your reading this article. What makes one answer better\nthan another is determined only by the interests of the questioner\n(are they interested in increasing web traffic to the SEP?\nunderstanding digital humanities? writing my biography? writing\nyours?). This shows how any one event implicates and arises with all\nothers. Consider further, though, that all things are empty. They have\nno independent self-nature, so what it is to be that thing is\nexplained entirely by all of the factors that allow it to appear as\nwhat it is. Thus it is not just that things depend on each other but\nthat things include each other. This inclusion applies not just\nbetween any two events but also between any event and the totality of\nother events; the story of the whole universe can be explicated from\nany one point. Brook Ziporyn (2000) calls this \u201comnicentric\nholism\u201dand it has similarities with Leibniz\u2019s claim that\nevery substance (monad) implicitly expresses all others. This\nconclusion serves the soteriological purposes of Buddhist\nphilosophy\u2014if any one thing implies all others, then it is\nimpossible to grasp only one thing. Grasping and attachment become\nincoherent. It is worth comparing this result with the elimination of\nloss through radical impartiality, discussed in Section 4.\n\n7. Coherence and Vital Energy in Neo-Confucianism\n\nThe interpenetration of emptiness and phenomena is an affirmation of\nthe changing world in which we live. Thus, it is false to see Chinese\nBuddhism as life-negating or as denying the diversity of the world.\nNonetheless, the metaphysics of emptiness is directed toward\novercoming attachments. Diversity remains, but there are no\nindividuals to grasp. The Confucian response, which became a dominant\nforce in the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), was driven primarily by an\naversion to these consequences. This reaction can be seen in three\nconcrete positions\u2014the acceptance of suffering and death as\nunavoidable, the differentiation of roles and norms within society,\nand the embrace of negative affects such as sorrow at the death of a\nparent or anxious concern for a child in danger. This Confucian\nmovement is known in Chinese as the \u201cLearning of the Way\u201d\n(Daoxue \u9053\u5b78) and in English as\n\u201cNeo-Confucianism.\u201d\n\nWhile based on practical concerns, this Confucian revival was\nsupported by metaphysical\n claims.[11]\n In terms of the dialectal movement we have seen, the Neo-Confucians\ntake all of the Buddhist positions as nihilistic. The first\ninfluential Confucian responses appear in cosmological arguments. We\ncan take Zhang Zai \u5f35\u8f09 (1020\u20131077) as an example.\n(For studies of Zhang Zai, see Ziporyn 2015; Kim 2015; Kasoff 1984.)\nZhang Zai\u2019s basic move is to argue that the ultimate, labeled as\n\u201cSupreme Emptiness\u201d (Taixu \u592a\u865b),\ncannot be nothingness but must be qi, and the fundamental\ncharacteristic of this qi must be a dynamic interplay between\nopposites. Zhang explains:\n\n\nThe Supreme Emptiness of necessity consists of vital energy. Vital\nenergy of necessity integrates to become the myriad things. Things of\nnecessity disintegrate and return to the Supreme Emptiness. Appearance\nand disappearance following this cycle are a matter of necessity.\n(trans. modified from W. Chan 1969: 501)\n\n\nThere are several important points to note in Zhang Zai\u2019s\nposition. First, he explicitly argues that the only way to explain the\norigins of the world we experience is if dynamism and differentiation\nare the very nature of existence. For this reason, Brook Ziporyn\nargues that the ultimate for Zhang Zai is not qi but harmony\nitself (Ziporyn 2015). Second, by positing qi as fundamental,\nZhang Zai shifts from questions about nihilism and reification back to\nthe relationship between the formed and the formless. In making the\nformed and formless two modalities of existence, Zhang Zai allows that\nboth are equally real. In this way, he reaffirms the importance of\nindividuated things like parents and children.\n\nZhang Zai\u2019s cosmology echoes the earlier Chinese cosmologies\ndiscussed in Section 3. To say that the nature of qi is\nactive differentiation is to say that the nature of qi is\nsheng, vitality or generation. This emphasis on being as a\nforce of growth and vitality was a common point among Neo-Confucians,\nlinked directly to the virtue of ren \u4ec1, humaneness or\nbenevolence. To be humane is to support and extend the generative\nprocess of nature itself. Furthermore, there is a unity to things in\nthe world, grounded in the fact that they are all made up of\nqi and they unfold in interlocking patterns of influence. As\nZhang Zai puts it in the famous Western Inscription:\n\n\nHeaven is my father and earth is my mother, and even such a small\ncreature as I finds an intimate place in their midst. Therefore that\nwhich fills the universe I regard as my body [ti \u9ad4]\nand that which directs the universe I consider as my nature\n[xing \u6027]. All people are my brothers and sisters, and\nall things are my companions. (trans from W. Chan 1969: 497)\n\n\nCheng Hao \u7a0b\u9865 (1032\u20131085) compares one who does not\ncare for other things to someone who has lost sensation in their own\nlimbs. Wang Yangming \u738b\u967d\u660e (1472\u20131529)\nextends these feelings of concern even to trampled grass and broken\ntiles.\n\nDeriving inclusive care from the vitality and unity of nature appeared\nin the Warring States Period, but in opposition to Confucianism. For\nthe Confucians, this focus on being as vitality needs an inherent\norder, which came through a reinterpretation of the term li\n\u7406. The complexity of the term appears in the range of common\ntranslations: principle, patterns, coherence. Li often refers\nto something we should follow and in this sense it might be taken as\nprinciples, but li also refers to actual patterns of\ndifferentiation, not just to ideals. Considering that li is\ncontextual and involves human purposes and perspectives, translating\nthe term as \u201ccoherence\u201d or \u201ccoherent patterns\u201d\nprobably best brings these various aspects together. Stephen C. Angle\ngives an excellent brief definition of li as \u201cthe\nvaluable, intelligible way that things fit together\u201d (Angle\n2009:\n 32).[12]\n There are patterns of coherence in the world, and these patterns\ndefine individual things, constitute nature as a system, and structure\nhuman society. Li describes the way that these patterns can\nbe optimally harmonized or made to cohere so as to foster the human\ngood (i.e., to be valuable and intelligible).\n\nThe Neo-Confucian interpretation of li is a return to earlier\nChinese views that took nature as having stable patterns that we can\nrecognize and follow. The Neo-Confucians defend these earlier views\nagainst what they saw as Buddhist attacks by claiming that the\ndifferentiated structure of the world we live in is real. These\npatterns of coherence give specific form to our concerns and efforts,\nso that one can justify caring primarily for one\u2019s own parents\nwhile still taking all things as extensions of one\u2019s own body.\nEven so, the Neo-Confucian conception of li retains several\nBuddhist aspects.\n\nThe most obvious example is the claim that the totality of li\nis contained in any one thing. Cheng Yi \u7a0b\u9824\n(1033\u20131107) coined what became a standard motto: \u201cLi is\none but distinguished as many\u201d (li yi fen shu\n\u7406\u4e00\u5206\u6b8a) (Angle 2009: 44). This unity within\ndiversity was illustrated with a metaphor taken from\nBuddhism\u2014the moon reflects on many different surfaces, but it\nremains the one same moon. Since li refers to patterns of\ncoherence and all things ultimately form one body, it follows that all\nthings are mutually implicated, a point already discussed in relation\nto Huayan Buddhism above. The Neo-Confucians do not go so far as to\nsay that each thing contains all other things,\nthough. Any instance of coherence implicates all others, but events\nstill have their own reality.\n\nAnother common Neo-Confucian claim with Buddhist overtones follows: if\nthe totality of li is included within any particular thing,\nthen it must exist within each person\u2019s heart/mind. One of the\nmain disputes among the Neo-Confucians was on the precise meaning and\nsignificance of this point. Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\nargued that li is the nature (xing) found in the\nheart, while Lu Xiangshan \u9678\u8c61\u5c71 (1139\u20131192)\nand Wang Yangming took li and the heart to be identical. This\nleads to a difference in emphasis between the two main schools of\nNeo-Confucianism regarding their recommended process of accessing\nli: the \u201cSchool of Li\u201d (lixue\n\u7406\u5b78) (also known as the Cheng-Zhu school) placed more\nemphasis on study and learning, while the \u201cSchool of\nHeart/Mind\u201d (xinxue \u5fc3\u5b78) (the Lu-Wang\nschool) concentrated more on self-reflection. This difference, though,\nis one of emphasis: since they agreed that li could be\naccessed through our own heart and through things in the world, all\nNeo-Confucians promoted both self-reflection and learning.\n\nNeo-Confucians always discuss li in relation to qi,\nvital energy. If li refers to patterns of coherence,\nqi is the stuff in which those patterns inhere. This\ndistinction has functional similarities with Aristotle\u2019s\ndistinction between form and matter, but the force of activity and\nchange is with qi rather than li. That means that\nli must be immanent in qi in some sense. The precise\nontological status of li and qi became one of the\nmain metaphysical disputes among Confucian philosophers. One could\neasily claim that the distinction between patterns of coherence and\nthe stuff that follows the patterns is conceptual rather than\nontological. That is close to the view seen in Zhang Zai, for whom\nqi is active and inherently patterned. For Zhu Xi and Wang\nYangming, though, li has ontological priority over\nqi. Zhu Xi writes:\n\n\nFundamentally, li and vital energy cannot be spoken of as\nprior or posterior. But if we must trace their origin, we are obliged\nto say that li is prior. However, li is not a\nseparate entity. It exists right in vital energy. Without vital\nenergy, li would have nothing to adhere to. (trans. modified\nfrom W. Chan 1969: 634)\n\n\nThe question of the relationship between qi and li\nextended into cosmogonies as well. While Zhang Zai took qi to\nbe the ultimate, Zhu Xi claimed the ultimate was li (using\nthe term Supreme Polarity). Since li is the locus of\nintelligibility and values, the question ultimately was whether causal\nand explanatory priority was with this coherence or if coherence was\ninstead a product of the generative forces of nature\n(qi).\n\nThe distinction between li and qi provided a way to\ndeal with the tension between the claim that the nature of human\nbeings is good and the recognition that people need extensive\nself-cultivation in order to actually be good. Li is\ninherently good and is the same in all things. In that sense, we\nalready have all that we need. The quality of qi, though,\nvaries. Turbid qi\u2014which manifests itself as selfishness\nand partiality\u2014obscures li. Thus from the perspective\nof li human nature is good, but from the perspective of\nli and qi together, a person can be good, bad, or in\nbetween. On the psychological level, the work of self-cultivation is\ncultivating tranquility and impartiality; on the metaphysical level,\none purifies qi so as to more perfectly express and\nparticipate in li.\n\nThis view of self-cultivation inherits the Buddhist claim that, since\neveryone possesses Buddha-nature (fo xing), everyone is\nalready enlightened, but merges it with Mengzi\u2019s claim that\nhuman nature (xing) is good. Unlike Mengzi, the process of\nself-cultivation is not a process of extension but rather of removing\nthe obstacles that keep us from being what we already are. Phillip J.\nIvanhoe has nicely captured this point by contrasting the views of\nself-cultivation for Mengzi and Wang Yangming as the difference\nbetween a model of development and a model of discovery (Ivanhoe\n2002). As in Buddhism, what needs to be removed are selfish and biased\ndesires. Unlike Buddhism, and in line with Mengzi, this enlightened\ncondition does not lead to a calm state free of desires and negative\nemotions. Instead, the li within us is expressed as\nspontaneously appropriate desires and emotions, including negative\nemotions like grief for a dying parent or anxious concern for a child\nin danger.\n8. Conclusion: Beyond \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d\n\nIf one turns to metaphysics in the twentieth century and beyond, it\nbecomes necessary to distinguish \u201cPhilosophy in China\u201d\nfrom \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d. Like almost everywhere else in\nthe world, the twentieth century in China was characterized by the\nincorporation of ideas from other cultures, most obviously from\nEurope. The terms \u201cphilosophy\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d were introduced as distinct concepts through\ntranslation and thus they become the objects of conscious reflection.\nEven scholars dedicated to \u201cChinese Philosophy\u201d set\nthemselves in dialogue with the West, so that almost all philosophy\nwas more or less intercultural. The main influences from Europe were\nKant, Hegel, and Marx, but a wide range of philosophers were\nincorporated, including Nietzsche, Bergson, Dewey, and Heidegger.\nAlmost all of the major philosophers in China\u2014from Xiong Shili\n\u718a\u5341\u529b (1885\u20131968) to Feng Youlan\n\u99ae\u53cb\u862d (1895\u20131990) to Mou Zongsan\n\u725f\u5b97\u4e09 (1909\u20131995)\u2014were concerned with\nestablishing a metaphysical foundation for Chinese\n Philosophy.[13]\n These philosophers, drawing on resources from multiple cultures and\ntraditions, are better suited for an entry on\n\u201cMetaphysics\u201d than one on \u201cMetaphysics in Chinese\nPhilosophy\u201d.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, Joseph A., 1999, \u201cZhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and\nPractice of Sagehood,\u201d in <em>Sources of Chinese Tradition</em>,\nWilliam Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom (eds.), 2<sup>nd</sup>\nedition, 2 volumes, New York: Columbia University Press.", "Ames, Roger T., 2011, <em>Confucian Role Ethics: A\nVocabulary</em>, Hong Kong and Honolulu: Chinese University of Hong\nKong Press and University of Hawai\u2019i Press.", "Ames, Roger T. and David L.
