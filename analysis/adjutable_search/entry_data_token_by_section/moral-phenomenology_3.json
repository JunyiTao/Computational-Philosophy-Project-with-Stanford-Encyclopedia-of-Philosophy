    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics\n2. Moral Phenomenology and Metaethics\n\nMetaethics addresses second-order questions about morality, including\nmetaphysical, epistemological, and semantic questions (see the entry\non\n metaethics).\n Phenomenological questions about moral experience significantly\nimpact views on these topics. If, for instance, some form of moral\nexperience has as an aspect of its presentational\n content[9]\n putatively instantiated moral properties (e.g., wrongness) or\nrelations (e.g., fittingness), this would be some evidence in favor of\na realist moral\n metaphysics.[10]\n Also, such experiences would arguably provide an experiential basis\nfor justified moral belief and perhaps moral knowledge. And, if moral\nexperience presents such properties and relations as aspects of their\ncontent, this would invite a moral semantics according to which\njudgments in which a moral property or relation is predicated of some\nitem of moral evaluation are truth-apt. Such issues bear on the\nquestion of whether ethics is or can be an \u201cobjective\u201d\nenterprise.\n\nIn the remainder of this section, we review some of the debates\nconcerning the bearing of moral phenomenology on metaethical issues.\nWe organize our review according to what we identified earlier as\nmajor types of moral experience, beginning with moral perception.\n",
