    "main_text": "Thought || The Three Aspects of the Embodiment of Truth (Hosshin; Dharmak\u0101ya)\n3.4 The Three Aspects of the Embodiment of Truth (Hosshin; Dharmak\u0101ya)\n\nIn addition to its four forms of embodiment, K\u016bkai (in his\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi chs. 3, 4, 5) systematically\nelucidates three aspects as belonging to the hosshin in its\ncosmic significance: the six universal elements (rokudai) as\ncomprising its own body or somaticity (hontai), the four\nmandalas (shimandara) as constituting its \u201cmarks\u201d\nor forms of appearance (y\u014ds\u014d), and the three\nmysteries (sanmitsu) constituting its functions\n(say\u014d). In all three aspects, there is involved an\ninterrelationship of non-duality between its macro-cosmic significance\nand its micro-cosmic significance, that is, between the\nhosshin qua cosmos as a whole and the practitioner\nas a being forming a part of, and partaking in, the cosmos. The three\naspects interpenetrate to make-up the macrocosmos while in their\nnon-duality with cosmic constituents, they become manifest through\nsuccessful Shingon practice and in one\u2019s consequent\nenlightenment.\n\nK\u016bkai\u2019s elucidation of these three aspects provide both a\ntheoretical and a practical grounding for his own conception of\nsokushinj\u014dbutsu or \u201cbecoming Buddha in this very\nembodied existence,\u201d by clarifying both its possibility and its\nmethod. Japanese commentators have often classified his thought along\nthe following lines: the theory of the six universal elements as\nproviding a metaphysic, the theory of the four mandalas as providing\nan epistemology, and the theory of the three mysteries as providing a\nmetapraxis. But one must also keep in mind that all three concerns\n\u2013 metaphysical, epistemological, and practical \u2013 are\nintertwined and inseparable in K\u016bkai\u2019s thinking.\nFurthermore all three involve the significance of the body so that\neven in his so-called \u201cepistemology,\u201d embodiment cannot be\nignored.\n\nIn the immediately following subsections I will briefly discuss each\nof these aspects before providing a more detailed exposition of them\nin the following sections.\n3.4.1 Somaticity (the six universal elements)\n\nHosshin in its somaticity is identified with the cosmos as an\norganic whole wherein thing-events come and go via\ninterdependent origination. The cosmos as such is called\nhokkai (Skrt: dharmadh\u0101tu; world/realm of the\nDharma), and in turn as the hosshin, it is the body\nor soma (tai) of the Buddha Dainichi. (However it\nshould not be understood as substantial in the western\nphilosophical sense because it is \u201cempty\u201d \u2013 more on\n\u201cemptiness\u201d below.) Hence K\u016bkai in\nSh\u014djijiss\u014dgi cites lines from the Avatamsaka\nS\u016btra that \u201call lands are in the body of the\nBuddha,\u201d or that \u201ceach hair [of the Buddha] contains\nmyriad lands as vast as oceans\u2026\u201d And yet simultaneously\nthe truth, the Dharma, embodied in the entire cosmos is manifest\nwithin each of its micro-cosmic parts. This view that the whole\npermeates its parts \u2013 reminding us perhaps of the more recent\ntheories of holonics or the holographic model of the universe \u2013\nallows K\u016bkai to show that the hosshin does indeed preach\nthe Dharma throughout the cosmos in its every single aspect.\n\nThis great cosmic body of the hosshin embraces all phenomena\nthrough the mutual \u201cnon-obstruction\u201d of the six universal\nelements (rokudai muge). (Mutual\n\u201cnon-obstruction\u201d or muge here must be understood\nto mean what allows for their interrelations and interpenetrations\nthat constitute things. In being non-substantial, they do not obstruct\neach other. And \u201cuniversal\u201d or dai here must be\nunderstood in its literal sense as \u201cgreat,\u201d meaning that\nit does not exclude any phenomena or thing-event in the cosmos at\nall.) As the cosmos, the hosshin is made up of the six\n\u201cgreat\u201d elements (fire, earth, water, air, space,\nconsciousness) which interrelate to constitute thing-events in their\ninterdependent origination. Their interaction thus constitutes the\nsomaticity of an ever-evolving whole. But as dependent origination\nequals emptiness (Skrt: \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101; Jpn:\nk\u016b) in Buddhism, this cosmic body is an embodiment of\nthe Dharma qua emptiness. Moreover emptiness also signifies\n\u201cspace,\u201d for the same graph (k\u016b) is used to\nmean \u201cemptiness\u201d and \u201cspace.\u201d Hence the cosmic\nbody in its endless vastness, as space embracing everything, can be\nseen as providing the space for the emergence of thing-events through\nthe intermingling of the six elements. Thus Dainichi\u2019s body as\nthe cosmic embodiment of the Dharma pervades all beings to\nmake up, through the six elements, each of their own bodies. And yet\nfrom another perspective, as the cosmic body is a vast emptiness that\nmakes room for the emergence of beings, each of these beings are in\nturn empty. For being and emptiness in the Buddhist understanding are\ntwo intertwining aspects of the same truth. (We shall discuss the more\nprecise sense of \u201cemptiness\u201d in the following sections.)\nSo the hosshin in its somaticity designates the ontological\nground of all beings but also designates their underlying\nde-ontologizing (or: me-ontologizing; or even better: anontological)\nemptiness, their non-substantiality.\n3.4.2 Form of appearance (the four mandalas)\n\nThe hosshin in its cosmic significance appears in the form or\nfigure (s\u014d) of a mandara (Skrt: mandala). That\nis, its cosmic body appears in a mandalic pattern, as represented in\nthe mandalas used in Shingon ritual. Correspondingly the mind of a\nsentient being is also supposed to take on the form of a mandala\nespecially as one advances in practice to realize non-duality with the\nmandalic hosshin. That is, the mind-and-body experience of\neach sentient being mirrors in its own way the mandalic pattern of the\ncosmos. As one becomes enlightened, one comes to realize this\ninter-mirroring. In the envisioning of reality as a mandala, the\npractitioner, who on the one hand is aiming for Buddhahood, is at\nthe same time also the Buddha existing in the mandalic reality\nand expressing itself in mandalic form. Whether seen as the form\nexperienced in the mind or as the form of the cosmos, the mandalic\nfigure is the Buddha\u2019s mode of expressing the Dharma. This\nmandalic appearance of the Buddha is categorized into four types,\nwhich we will discuss in a section below.\n3.4.3 Function (the three mysteries)\n\nThe function of the hosshin is equated with all movements and\nchange that occur in the cosmos. Such cosmic alterations are\ncategorized in three ways in terms of visible form (e.g., loco-motion\nor change of place, and trans-formation or change in shape), the\naudible (sound), and the mental (the thinking process). Visible\nalterations are movements of Dainichi\u2019s body (shin),\naudible alterations are movements of Dainichi\u2019s speech\n(ku), and mental alterations are movements of\nDainichi\u2019s thoughts (i). Together they are called the\n\u201cthree mysteries\u201d (Skrt: tri-guyha; Chn:\nsan-mi; Jpn: sanmitsu) making up the functions\n(y\u016b) of the hosshin. Since the body of Dainichi\nis the cosmos itself, these \u201cthree mysteries\u201d of its\nfunctions are at work in all thing-events and are ultimately\nnon-dualistic with the corresponding movements of ourselves.\n",
