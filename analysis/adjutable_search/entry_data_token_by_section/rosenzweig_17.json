    "main_text": "Life and Thought after The Star || Illness\n4.3 Illness\n\n\nIn the fall of 1921, less than a year into his directorship of the\nLehrhaus and\u2014eerily\u2014months after he wrote his\naccount of philosophical paralysis, Rosenzweig began to notice symptoms\nof a disturbance of the nervous system. In February of 1922 he was\ndiagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Rosenzweig\ncontinued to devote himself to directing and teaching in the\nLehrhaus, but already in the spring of 1922, his speech was\nsignificantly impaired and he experienced difficulty writing. At the\nend of the summer of 1922, Rudolf Hallo replaced Rosenzweig as the\ninstitute\u2019s director, although Rosenzweig remained intimately involved\nin the programmatic development of the Lehrhaus in the years\nthat followed. By the end of 1922, Rosenzweig could no longer write;\nhe remained able to communicate orally to his wife and to a few others\nclose to him\u2014and through these to others as well\u2014until the\nspring of 1923. At that time the Rosenzweigs purchased a special\ntypewriting machine which allowed Rosenzweig first to type, and then\nsimply to indicate, the letters (and later, the first letters) of the\nwords he wished to communicate, by using a lever to move a disk to the\ndesired letter. As Rosenzweig became further incapacitated, more and\nmore was demanded of his wife, Edith, who would regularly guess the\nword Rosenzweig wished to convey from Rosenzweig\u2019s indication of that\nword\u2019s first letter. Incredibly, this procedure allowed Rosenzweig not\nonly to continue to communicate with others in person, but to continue\n\u201cwriting\u201d as well up until the time of his death.\n",
