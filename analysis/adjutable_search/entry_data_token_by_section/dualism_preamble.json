    "main_text": "\n\n\nThis entry concerns dualism in the philosophy of mind. The term\n\u2018dualism\u2019 has a variety of uses in the history of\nthought. In general, the idea is that, for some particular domain,\nthere are two fundamental kinds or categories of things or\nprinciples. In theology, for example a \u2018dualist\u2019 is\nsomeone who believes that Good and Evil \u2013 or God and the \nDevil \u2013 are independent and more or less equal forces in the\nworld. Dualism contrasts with monism, which is the theory that there\nis only one fundamental kind, category of thing or principle; and,\nrather less commonly, with pluralism, which is the view that there are\nmany kinds or categories.  In the philosophy of mind, dualism is the\ntheory that the mental and the physical \u2013 or mind and body or\nmind and brain \u2013 are, in some sense, radically different kinds\nof things. Because common sense tells us that there are physical\nbodies, and because there is intellectual pressure towards producing a\nunified view of the world, one could say that materialist monism is\nthe \u2018default option\u2019. Discussion about dualism, therefore,\ntends to start from the assumption of the reality of the physical\nworld, and then to consider arguments for why the mind cannot be\ntreated as simply part of that world. \n",
