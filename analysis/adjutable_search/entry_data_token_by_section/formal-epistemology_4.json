    "main_text": "First Case Study: Confirming Scientific Theories || The Problem of the Priors\n1.4 The Problem of the Priors\n\nThis last point is a very general, very important phenomenon. Like the\naxioms of first-order logic, the axioms of probability are quite weak\n(Howson and Urbach 1993; Christensen 2004). Unless \\(H\\) is a\ntautology or contradiction, the axioms only tell us that its\nprobability is somewhere between \\(0\\) and 1. If we can express \\(H\\)\nas a disjunction of two logically incompatible sub-hypotheses, \\(H_1\\)\nand \\(H_2\\), and we know the probabilities of these sub-hypotheses,\nthen the third axiom lets us compute \\(p(H) = p(H_1)+p(H_2)\\). But\nthis just pushes things back a step, since the axioms by themselves\nonly tell us that \\(p(H_1)\\) and \\(p(H_2)\\) must themselves lie\nbetween \\(0\\) and 1.\n\nThis weakness of the probability axioms generates the famous\nproblem of the priors, the problem of saying where initial\nprobabilities come from. Are they always based on evidence previously\ncollected? If so, how does scientific inquiry get started? If instead\nthey\u2019re not based on previous evidence but are a\npriori, what principles govern this a priori reasoning?\nFormal epistemologists are split on this question. The so-called\nobjectivists see the probability axioms as incomplete,\nwaiting to be supplemented by additional postulates that determine the\nprobabilities with which inquiry should begin. (The Principle of\nIndifference (PoI) is the leading candidate here. See the entry on the\n interpretation of probability.)\n The so-called subjectivists think instead that there is no\nsingle, correct probability function \\(p\\) with which inquiry should\nbegin. Different inquirers may begin with different values for \\(p\\),\nand none of them is thereby more or less scientific or rational than\nthe others.\n\nIn later sections the problem of the priors will return several times,\nillustrating its importance and ubiquity.\n",
