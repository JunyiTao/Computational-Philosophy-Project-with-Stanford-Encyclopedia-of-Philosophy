    "main_text": "Issues in the Madhyamaka school\n1. Issues in the Madhyamaka school\n\nThere a number of points that all M\u0101dhyamika thinkers have in\ncommon. In all of them one finds some version of the doctrine of two\ntruths, according to which there is a level of understanding that\nconsists of an accurate account of the world as it is experienced in\neveryday life and another level of understanding that is conducive to\nreaching the ultimate goal (param\u0101rtha) of Buddhist\npractice, namely, nirvana, understood as the absence of attachment,\naversion and delusion with no possibility of their return. There is\nalso broad agreement that language is limited to the everyday level of\nunderstanding and that the truth of nirvana is beyond the reach of\nlanguage and of the conceptualization that makes language\npossible.\n\nWhere differences arise among M\u0101dhyamika thinkers is on the issue\nof how these two truths relate to one another. Does careful\nverbalization and thinking do any good in bringing one closer to\nnirvana, or is it invariably an obstacle? Is there any room within\nMadhyamaka for clear thinking and carefully wrought argumentation, or\nare all attempts to arrive at clear thought and rigorous argumentation\nultimately delusional and therefore to be abandoned along with more\nobvious forms of delusion?\n\nAnother area in which M\u0101dhyamakas differ from one another is in\ntheir attitude toward the other main school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school, which M\u0101dhyamikas\npresent as advocating a kind of subjective idealism. Early\nM\u0101dhyamikas tended to refute the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine that\nall the contents within awareness arise out of awareness itself and\nare thus ontologically at one with consciousness. Later\nM\u0101dhyamikas found room for that view, usually by portraying\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra as a philosophy that prepares one intellectually\nand emotionally for the difficult truth that all things are lacking in\ninherent natures and all that we think of as knowledge is ultimately\nwithout grounding.\n",
