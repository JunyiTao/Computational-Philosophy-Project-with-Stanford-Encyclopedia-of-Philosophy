    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cSense data\u201d, or \u201csense datum\u201d in the\nsingular, is a technical term in philosophy that means \u201cwhat is\ngiven to sense\u201d. Sense data constitute what we, as perceiving\nsubjects, are directly aware of in perceptual experience, prior to\ncognitive acts such as inferring, judging, or affirming that\nsuch-and-such objects or properties are present. In vision, sense data\nare typically described as patches exhibiting colors and shapes. For\nthe other senses, they would manifest sounds, tastes, odors, and\ntactile qualities. Suppose that you are looking at a brown table with\na white coaster on it; your sense data would be a patch of brown\ncorresponding to the brown expanse in your field of view, along with a\nroundish-shaped white patch. Based on such data, you might come to\naffirm that a brown thing and a white thing, or a table and a coaster,\nare present before you.\n\nStarting in the early twentieth century, the notion of \u201csense\ndata\u201d played a central role in discussions of knowledge and of\nthe ontology of perceptual experience. In epistemology, sense data\nwere offered as a basis for all other sensory knowledge. They were\nepistemically privileged: many authors held that one could not be\nwrong about one\u2019s sense data. Concerning what sense data are\n(their ontology), there has been a change of consensus. The early\nadvocates of sense data (explicitly so-called) mainly considered them\nto be mind-independent, that is, to exist apart from the mind, perhaps\nas a special kind of thing, neither mental nor physical. In the latter\npart of the twentieth century, sense data came to be viewed most often\nas mind-dependent, as mental objects or contents of which we are\ndirectly aware in perceptual experience. Sense data dominated\ndiscussion of perception in the first half of the twentieth century.\nThe notion is now frequently used as a stalking horse in the\nphilosophy of perception, as an example of a position that should be\navoided.\n\nThis entry first examines the classical meaning of the term\n\u201csense data\u201d and the concept of a sensory given. It then\npursues the history of these notions, from the early modern period to\nthe mid twentieth century, before turning to major critical responses\nthat led to a decline in the popularity of sense data. Finally, it\nconsiders recent arguments for sense data and concludes by placing\nsense-data theory within a larger genus of perceptual theories that\ndistinguish having sense impressions from the perception of individual\nobjects.\n",
