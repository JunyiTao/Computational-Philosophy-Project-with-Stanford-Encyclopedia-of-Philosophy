    "main_text": "The Role of Introspection in Scientific Psychology || Early Skepticism about Introspective Observation\n3.2 Early Skepticism about Introspective Observation\n\nEarly introspective psychologists\u2019 theoretical discussions of\nthe nature of introspection were often framed in reaction to\nskepticism about the scientific viability of introspection, especially\nthe concern that the introspective act interferes with or destroys the\nmental state or process that is its\n target.[1])\n The most influential formulation of this concern was\nComte\u2019s:\n\nBut as for observing in the same way intellectual phenomena\nat the time of their actual presence, that is a manifest\nimpossibility. The thinker cannot divide himself into two, of whom one\nreasons whilst the other observes him reason. The organ observed and\nthe organ observing being, in this case, identical, how could\nobservation take place? This pretended psychological method is then\nradically null and void (1830, using the translation of James 1890\n[1981, 188]).\n\n\nIntrospective psychologists tended to react to this concern in one of\nthree ways. The most concessive approach\u2014recommended, for\nexample, by James (1890 [1981]; see also Mill 1865 [1961]; Lyons\n1986)\u2014was to grant Comte\u2019s point for concurrent\nintrospection, that is, introspection simultaneous with the target\nstate or process, and to emphasize in contrast immediate\nretrospection, that is, reflecting on or attending to the target\nprocess (usually a conscious experience) very shortly after\nit occurs. Since the scientific observation occurs only after the\ntarget process is complete, it does not interfere with that process;\nbut of course the delay between the process and the observation must\nbe as brief as possible to ensure that the process is accurately\nremembered.\n\nBrentano (1874 [1973]) responded to Comte\u2019s concern by\ndistinguishing between \u201cinner observation\u201d\n[innere Beobachtung] and \u201cinner\nperception\u201d [innere Wahrnehmung]. Observation,\nas Brentano characterizes it, involves dedicating full attention to a\nphenomenon, with the aim of apprehending it accurately. This\ndedication of attention necessarily interferes with the process to be\nobserved if the process is a mental one; therefore, he says, inner\nobservation is problematic as a scientific psychological method. Inner\nperception, in contrast, according to Brentano, does not\ninvolve attention to our mental lives and thus does not objectionably\ndisturb them. While our \u201cattention is turned toward a different\nobject \u2026 we are able to perceive, incidentally, the mental\nprocesses which are directed toward that object\u201d (1874 [1973,\n30]). Brentano concedes that inner perception necessarily lacks the\nadvantages of attentive observation, so he recommends conjoining it\nwith retrospective methods.\n\nWundt (1888) agrees with Comte and Brentano that observation\nnecessarily involves attention and so often interferes with the\nprocess to be observed, if that process is an inner, psychological\none. To a much greater extent than Brentano, however, Wundt emphasizes\nthe importance to scientific psychology of direct attention to\nexperience, including planful and controlled variation. The\npsychological method of \u201cinner perception\u201d is, for Wundt,\nthe method of holding and attentively manipulating a memory image or\nreproduction of a past psychological process. Although Wundt sees some\nvalue in this retrospective method, he thinks it has two crucial\nshortcomings: First, one can only work with what one remembers of the\nprocess in question\u2014the manipulation of a memory-image cannot\ndiscover new elements. And second, foreign elements may be\nunintentionally introduced through association\u2014one might confuse\none\u2019s memory of a process with one\u2019s memory of another\nassociated process or object.\n\nTherefore, Wundt suggests, the science of psychology must depend upon\nthe attentive observation of mental processes as they occur. He argues\nthat those who think attention necessarily distorts the target mental\nprocess are too pessimistic. A subclass of mental processes\nremains relatively unperturbed by attentive observation\u2014the\n\u201csimpler\u201d mental processes, especially of perception\n(1896/1902, 27\u201328). The experience of seeing red, Wundt claims,\nis more or less the same whether or not one is attending to the\npsychological fact that one is experiencing redness. Wundt also\nsuggests that the basic processes of memory, feeling, and volition can\nbe observed systematically and without excessive disruption. These\nalone, he thinks, can be studied by introspective psychology\n(see also Wundt 1874 [1904]; 1896 [1902]; 1907). Other aspects of our\npsychology must be approached through non-introspective methods such\nas the observation of language, mythology, culture, and human and\nanimal development.\n",
