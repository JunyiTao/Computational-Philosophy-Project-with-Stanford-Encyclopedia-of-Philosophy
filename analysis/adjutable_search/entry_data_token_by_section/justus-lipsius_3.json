As\nMontaigne, one of its admiring readers, wrote:\n\nHow I wish that, during my lifetime, someone like Justus Lipsius (the\nmost learned man left, a polished and judicious mind \u2026), had\nthe health, the will and sufficient leisure to compile an honest and\ncareful account which listed by class and by category everything we\ncan find out about the opinions of ancient philosophy on the subject\nof our being and our morals; it would include their controversies and\ntheir reputations, it would tell us who belonged to which school, and\nhow far the founders and their followers actually applied their\nprecepts on memorable occasions which could serve as examples. What a\nbeautiful and useful book that would be! (Essays II.12).\n\n\nLipsius did, in fact, go on to supply such an account, at least in\nrelation to Stoic thought. Fearing that his poor health would prevent\nhim from completing his edition and commentary on Seneca, Lipsius, at\nthe end of 1602, decided to publish beforehand his Manuductio ad\nStoicam philosophiam (\u201cGuide to Stoic Philosophy\u201d)\nand Physiologia Stoicorum (\u201cPhysical Theory of the\nStoics\u201d). A third work in this series, to be entitled\nEthica, was planned but never completed. In the two published\ntreatises, which came out in 1604, Lipsius attempted to reconstruct a\ncoherent philosophical system of Stoicism, focusing, as he had done in\nDe constantia, on its compatibility with Christian\ndoctrine.\n",
