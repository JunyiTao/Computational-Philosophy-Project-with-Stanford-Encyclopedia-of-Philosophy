    "main_text": "Basic Questions || Varieties of Goodness\n1.1 Varieties of Goodness\n\nClaims about good simpliciter are those which have garnered the\nmost attention in moral philosophy. This is partly because as it is\nusually understood, these are the \u201cgood\u201d claims that\nconsequentialists hold to have a bearing on what we ought to do.\nConsequentialism, so understood, is the view that you ought to do\nwhatever action is such that it would be best if you did it. This\nleaves, however, a wide variety of possible theories about how such\nclaims are related to other kinds of \u201cgood\u201d claim.\n1.1.1 Good Simpliciter and Good For\n\nFor example, consider a simple point of view theory, according\nto which what is good simpliciter differs from what is good for\nJack, in that being good for Jack is being good from a certain point\nof view \u2014 Jack\u2019s \u2014 whereas being good\nsimpliciter is being good from a more general point of view\n\u2014 the point of view of the universe (compare Nagel [1985]). The\npoint of view theory reduces both good for and good\nsimpliciter to good from the point of view of, and\nunderstands good simpliciter claims as about the point of view\nof the universe. One problem for this view is to make sense of what\nsort of thing points of view could be, such that Jack and the universe\nare both the kinds of thing to have one.\n\nAccording to a different sort of theory, the agglomerative\ntheory, goodness simpliciter is just what you get by\n\u201cadding up\u201d what is good for all of the various people\nthat there are. Rawls [1971] attributes this view to utilitarians, and\nit fits with utilitarian discussions such as that of Smart\u2019s\ncontribution to Smart and Williams [1973], but much more work would\nhave to be done in order to make it precise. We sometimes say things\nlike, \u201cwearing that outfit in the sun all day is not going to be\ngood for your tan line\u201d, but your tan line is not one of the\nthings whose good it seems plausible to \u201cadd up\u201d in order\nto get what is good simpliciter. Certainly it is not one of the\nthings whose good classical utilitarians would want to add up. So the\nfact that sapient and even sentient beings are not the only kinds of\nthing that things can be good or bad for sets an important constraint\nboth on accounts of the good for relation, and on theories\nabout how it is related to good simpliciter.\n\nRather than accounting for either of goodness simpliciter or\ngoodness-for in terms of the other, some philosophers have\ntaken one of these seriously at the expense of the other. For example,\nPhilippa Foot [1985] gives an important but compressed argument that\napparent talk about what is good simpliciter can be made\nsense of as elliptical talk about what is good for some unmentioned\nperson, and Foot\u2019s view can be strengthened (compare Shanklin\n[2011], Finlay [2014]) by allowing that apparent good\nsimpliciter claims are often generically quantified\nstatements about what is, in general, good for a person. Thomson\n[2008] famously defends a similar view.\n\nG.E. Moore [1903], in contrast, struggled to make sense of good-for\nclaims. In his refutation of egoism, Moore attributed to ethical\negoists the theory that what is good for Jack (or \u201cin\nJack\u2019s good\u201d) is just what is good and in Jack\u2019s\npossession, or alternatively, what it is good that Jack possesses.\nMoore didn\u2019t argue against these theses directly, but he did\nshow that they cannot be combined with universalizable egoism. It is\nnow generally recognized that to avoid Moore\u2019s arguments,\negoists need only to reject these analyses of good for, which\nare in any case unpromising (Smith [2003]).\n1.1.2 Attributive Good\n\nOther kinds of views understand good simpliciter in terms of\nattributive good. What, after all, are the kinds of things to which we\nattribute goodness simpliciter? According to many philosophers,\nit is to propositions, or states of affairs. This is supported by a\ncursory study of the examples we have considered, in which what is\nbeing said to be good appears to be picked out by complementizers like\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cthat\u201d, and \u201cfor\u201d: \u201cit\nwould be good if you did that\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s good that you\ncame\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s better for it to end now\u201d. If\ncomplementizer phrases denote propositions or possible states of\naffairs, then it is reasonable to conjecture, along with Foot [1985]\nthat being good simpliciter is being a good state of affairs,\nand hence that it is a special case of attributive good (if it makes\nsense at all \u2014 Geach and Foot both argue that it does not, on\nthe ground that states of affairs are too thin of a kind to support\nattributive good claims).\n\nSee the\n\nSupplement on Four Complications about Attributive Good\n\n\nfor further complications that arise when we consider the attributive\nsense of \u201cgood\u201d.\n\nSome philosophers have used the examples of attributive good and\ngood for in order to advance arguments against noncognitivist\nmetaethical theories (See the entry\n cognitivism and non-cognitivism).\n The basic outlines of such an argument go like this: noncognitivist\ntheories are designed to deal with good simpliciter, but have\nsome kind of difficulties accounting for attributive good or for\ngood for. Hence, there is a general problem with noncognitivist\ntheories, or at least a significant lacuna they leave. It has\nsimilarly been worried that noncognitivist theories will have problems\naccounting for so-called \u201cagent-relative\u201d value [see\nsection 4], again, apparently, because of its relational nature. There\nis no place to consider this claim here, but note that it would be\nsurprising if relational uses of \u201cgood\u201d like these were in\nfact a deep or special problem for noncognitivism; Hare\u2019s\naccount in The Language of Morals (Hare [1952]) was\nspecifically about attributive uses of \u201cgood\u201d, and it is\nnot clear why relational noncognitive attitudes should be harder to\nmake sense of than relational beliefs.\n1.1.3 Relational Strategies\n\nIn an extension of the strategies just discussed, some theorists have\nproposed views of \u201cgood\u201d which aspire to treat all of good\nsimpliciter, good for, and attributive good as special\ncases. A paradigm of this approach is the \u201cend-relational\u201d\ntheory of Paul Ziff [1960] and Stephen Finlay [2004], [2014].\nAccording to Ziff, all claims about goodness are relative to ends or\npurposes, and \u201cgood for\u201d and attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d sentences are simply different ways of making these\npurposes (more or less) explicit. Talk about what is good for Jack,\nfor example, makes the purpose of Jack\u2019s being happy (say)\nexplicit, while talk about what is a good knife makes our usual\npurposes for knives (cutting things, say) explicit. The claim about\ngoodness is then relativized accordingly.\n\nViews adopting this strategy need to develop in detail answers to just\nwhat, exactly, the further, relational, parameter on\n\u201cgood\u201d is. Some hold that it is ends, while others\nsay things like \u201caims\u201d. A filled-out version of this view\nmust also be able to tell us the mechanics of how these ends\ncan be made explicit in \u201cgood for\u201d and attributive\n\u201cgood\u201d claims, and needs to really make sense of both of\nthose kinds of claim as of one very general kind. And, of course, this\nsort of view yields the prediction that non-explicitly relativized\n\u201cgood\u201d sentences \u2014 including those used throughout\nmoral philosophy \u2014 are really only true or false once the end\nparameter is specified, perhaps by context.\n\nThis means that this view is open to the objection that it fails to\naccount for a central class of uses of \u201cgood\u201d in ethics,\nwhich by all evidence are non-relative, and for which the\nlinguistic data do not support the hypothesis that they are\ncontext-sensitive. J.L. Mackie held a view like this one and embraced\nthis result \u2014 Mackie\u2019s [1977] error theory about\n\u201cgood\u201d extended only to such putative non-relational\nsenses of \u201cgood\u201d. Though he grants that there are such\nuses of \u201cgood\u201d, Mackie concludes that they are mistaken.\nFinlay [2014], in contrast, argues that he can use ordinary pragmatic\neffects in order to explain the appearances. The apparently\nnon-relational senses of \u201cgood\u201d, Finlay argues, really are\nrelational, and his theory aspires to explain why they seem\notherwise.\n1.1.4 What\u2019s Special About Value Claims\n\nThe sentences I have called \u201cvalue claims\u201d present special\ncomplications. Unlike the other sorts of \u201cgood\u201d sentences,\nthey do not appear to admit, in a natural way, of comparisons.\nSuppose, for example, with G.E. Moore, that pleasure is good and\nknowledge is good. Which, we might ask, is better? This question does\nnot appear to make very much sense, until we fix on some amount\nof pleasure and some amount of knowledge. But if Sue is a good\ndancer and Huw is a good dancer, then it makes perfect sense to ask\nwho is the better dancer, and without needing to fix on any particular\namount of dancing \u2014 much less on any amount of Sue or\nHuw. In general, just as the kinds of thing that can be tall are the\nsame kinds of thing as can be taller than each other, the kinds of\nthing that can be good are the same kinds of thing as can be better\nthan one another. But the sentences that we are calling \u201cvalue\nclaims\u201d, which predicate \u201cgood\u201d of some stuff,\nappear not to be like this.\n\nOne possible response to this observation, if it is taken seriously,\nis to conclude that so-called \u201cvalue claims\u201d have a\ndifferent kind of logical form or structure. One way of implementing\nthis idea, the good-first theory, is to suppose that\n\u201cpleasure is good\u201d means something roughly like,\n\u201c(other things equal) it is better for there to be more\npleasure\u201d, rather than, \u201cpleasure is better than most\nthings (in some relevant comparison class)\u201d, on a model with\n\u201cSue is a good dancer\u201d, which means roughly, \u201cSue is\na better dancer than most (in some relevant comparison class)\u201d.\nAccording to a very different kind of theory, the value-first\ntheory, when we say that pleasure is good, we are saying that pleasure\nis a value, and things are better just in case there is more of the\nthings which are values. These two theories offer competing orders of\nexplanation for the same phenomenon. The good-first theory analyzes\nvalue claims in terms of \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter, while the\nvalue-first theory analyzes \u201cgood\u201d simpliciter in\nterms of value claims. The good-first theory corresponds to the thesis\nthat states of affairs are the \u201cprimary bearers\u201d of value;\nthe value-first theory corresponds to the alternative thesis that it\nis things like pleasure or goodness (or perhaps their instances) that\nare the \u201cprimary bearers\u201d of value.\n\nAccording to a more skeptical view, sentences like \u201cpleasure is\ngood\u201d do not express a distinctive kind of claim at all, but are\nmerely what you get when you take a sentence like \u201cpleasure is\ngood for Jill to experience\u201d, generically quantify out Jill, and\nellipse \u201cto experience\u201d. Following an idea also developed\nby Finlay [2014], Robert Shanklin [2011] argues that in general,\ngood-for sentences pattern with experiencer adjectives like\n\u201cfun\u201d, which admit of these very syntactic\ntransformations: witness \u201cJack is fun for Jill to talk\nto\u201d, \u201cJack is fun to talk to\u201d, \u201cJack is\nfun\u201d. This view debunks the issue over which the views discussed\nin the last paragraph disagree, for it denies that there is any such\ndistinct topic for value claims to be about. (It may also explain the\nfailures of comparative forms, above, on the basis of differences in\nthe elided material.)\n",
