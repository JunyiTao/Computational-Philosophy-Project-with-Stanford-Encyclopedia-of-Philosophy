    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes individuals act together, and sometimes they act\nindependently of one another. It\u2019s a distinction that matters. You\nare likely to make more headway in a difficult task working with\nothers; and even if little progress is made, there\u2019s at least the\ncomfort and solidarity that comes with a collective undertaking. Or,\nto take a very different perspective, the realization (or delusion)\nthat the many bits of rudeness one has been suffering of late are part\nof a concerted effort can be of significance in identifying\nwhat one is up against: the accumulation of grievances (no doubt well\ncatalogued) is seen, not as an unfortunate coincidence of affronts\nstemming from various quarters, but as itself a product of a unified\nexercise of agency. A paranoid conspiracy theorist is not usually to\nbe taken seriously. But he does get right that it certainly would be\nawful, for example, if everyone were out to get him and were\nworking together to do so.\n\nShared agency also has important normative implications. Institutions\nor laws established by everyone acting together have a status\ndifferent from those that are, for example, imposed on a people by the\ndictates of one. And the nature of justification, be it epistemic or\npractical, might depend on whether it figures in the context of a\nshared enterprise. No wonder, then, that shared activity and intention\nis of interest for a variety of disciplines, including politics,\nsocial science, economics, ethics, law, epistemology (especially\ntestimony and social epistemology), and psychology.\n\nBut what is it to act together? The question has received sustained\ndiscussion in contemporary philosophy of action. Central concerns have\nbeen to explicate the distinctive features of shared agency, and to\ninvestigate the possibility and scope of reduction: can shared agency\nbe understood in terms of the resources available to us from the study\nof individual agency? This entry will focus on some issues most\nclosely related to the philosophy of action. See the entry on\ncollective intentionality for a broader discussion. \n",
