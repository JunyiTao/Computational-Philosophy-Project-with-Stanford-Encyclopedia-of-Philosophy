The Character of William\u2019s Philosophical Works\n\nThe reader of William\u2019s philosophical works is struck by their\ndifference in character from the mainstream of philosophical and\ntheological writing of the early thirteenth century. Whereas\nWilliam\u2019s contemporaries tend to compose works as a series of\nlinked questions, each treated according to the question method (a\nparadigm of which is Aquinas\u2019s later Summa theologiae),\nWilliam instead follows the practice of Avicenna and Avicebron and\ncomposes treatises much more akin to a modern book. Indeed, William\neven models his writing style to some degree on the Latin translations\nof these authors. These features, together with William\u2019s\nfrequent use of analogies, metaphors and examples drawn from everyday\nlife, his long-winded, rambling prose and frequent digressions, his\nharsh assessments of opponents as imbeciles or morons, and his urging\nthat proponents of dangerous doctrines be wiped out by fire and sword,\nmake for an inimitable and immediately recognizable style.\n\nOne of the costs of this style, however, is that at times it can be\nhard to tell precisely what William thinks. Too often he lets\nmetaphors or analogies bear the argumentative burden in lieu of more\ncareful analysis. And while William\u2019s inventive mind could\ngenerate arguments for a position with ease, their quality is uneven:\noften he proposes problematic arguments without appearing to recognize\nthe difficulties they contain, as may be apparent below to the\ndiscerning reader, while at other times he shows an acute awareness of\nthe fundamental problems an issue raises.\n",
