    "main_text": "Ordinary Language Philosophy\n8. Ordinary Language Philosophy\n\nGrice was constantly concerned with philosophical methodology, and the\ndiscussion so far omits one important methodological focus: ordinary\nlanguage philosophy. Although it was by no means Grice\u2019s sole\nphilosophical commitment, it was a central one. \n\nGrice is a well-known critic of ordinary language philosophy,\nand one of his main targets was J. L. Austin and a style of reasoning\nhe popularized. Austin thought there was a relatively clear notion of\nwhat it is inappropriate to say, and that we could delineate\ntruth-conditions by identifying instances of inappropriateness\n(Warner, 2012). For example, he inferred from (1) \u201cTypically,\nwhen one acts, it would be inappropriate to say either that one acted\nvoluntarily or that one acted involuntarily\u201d to (2)\n\u201cTypically, when one acts, one acts neither voluntarily nor\ninvoluntarily.\u201d As Grice convincingly argues, the inference\nfails because being untrue is not the only form of inappropriateness.\nSomething may be true but inappropriate to say for other reasons\n(Grice 1960, 1975, 1981, 1989). \n\nGrice was, however, also a life-long practitioner of ordinary language\nphilosophy. He begins the \u201cProlegomena\u201d to Studies in\nthe Way of Words by noting that \u201csome may regard [ordinary\nlanguage philosophy] as an outdated style of philosophy,\u201d but he\nurges us \u201cnot to be too quick to write off such a style.\u201d\nInstead, he urges us to build \u201ca theory which will enable one to\ndistinguish between the case in which an utterance is false or fails\nto be true, or more generally fails to correspond to the world in some\nfavored way, and the case in which it is inappropriate for reasons of\na different kind\u201d (Grice 1989, 4). Much of Studies in the\nWay of Words addresses this task. \n\nWhy bother to build such a theory? There are many possible answers,\nand Grice would no doubt have given more than one, but we focus on\njust one answer, which is implicit in this work. Recall that, on his\nview, commonsense psychology consists, at least in part, of a body of\nself-justifying descriptive, explanatory, and evaluative principles.\nThe principles are \u2018self-justifying\u2019 in the sense\nexplained earlier in section 6. An illuminating description of these\nprinciples would be an illuminating description of how we think, and\nsuch a description would certainly be of interest. How do we get one?\nBy carefully examining what we say. Two tenets of ordinary language\nphilosophy were that a clear view of what we mean in the\nlanguage we use is a clear view of what we think, and that a\nnecessary step in getting clear view of what we mean is close\nattention to the details of what we say. But the detailed\nexamination will only reveal what we mean if we can reliably\ndistinguish between \u201cthe case in which an utterance is false or\nfails to be true, or more generally fails to correspond to the world\nin some favored way, and the case in which it is inappropriate for\nreasons of a different kind.\u201d \n",
