    "main_text": "Aesthetics || The New Negro\n5.1 The New Negro\n\nPrior to the period of individual expression characteristic of the\nHarlem Renaissance, Negro art in Locke's estimation had as its primary\nfunction representation of a Negro type that was socially acceptable\nand laudably ideal. The aim of much Negro art was to advance\npresentations of the Negro as civilized, cultured, and capable of\nmaking a worthwhile contribution to American society, or to portray\nblacks in America as a progressive people, needing only to be\nliberated from slavery or Jim Crow segregation to realize their true\npotential. In discharging this representative function, Negro art was\nconsumed with the promulgation of stereotypes and counter-stereotypes.\nIt had constantly to react against negative portrayals and stifling\nsocial pressures; to attempt to make out of Negro life and experience\nsomething worthy of respect, a fitting object of honor and emulation.\nAs Locke put it, \n\nfor generations in the mind of America, the Negro has been more of a\nformula than a human being\u2014a something to be argued about,\ncondemned or defended, to be \u2018kept down,\u2019 or \u2018in his\nplace,\u2019 or \u2018helped up,\u2019 to be worried with or\nworried over, harassed or patronized, a social bogey or a social\nburden. (NN 3\u20134)\n\n\nThe primary consequence of this social environment on black aesthetics\nin the United States according to Locke was its Ghettoization. In\ndealing with this specialized subject matter of social uplift Negro\naesthetics segregates itself from the broader American social context\nand fails to achieve universal human appeal. \u201cThe thinking\nNegro,\u201d by whom Locke seems to have Du Bois primarily in mind,\n\u201chas been induced to share this same general attitude, to focus\nhis attention on controversial issues, to see himself in the distorted\nperspective of a social problem\u201d (NN 3\u20134).\n\nArt at its best on Locke's view is not propaganda, and though there\nmay be some initial phase in which art is forced to perform such a\nfunction that is not the ultimate goal. \u201cUntil recently,\u201d\nLocke comments \u201clacking self-understanding, we have been almost\nas much of a problem to ourselves as we still are to others.\u201d\nYet as \u201cthe thinking few know\u201d as that self-understanding\nis achieved and worked into artistic expression the result is\n\u201cthat in the reaction the vital inner grip of prejudice has been\nbroken\u201d (NN 4). This is the first significant change in the\nsocial environment that produces the \u201cNew Negro\u201d; namely,\nthe attitude of young Negro artist to racial segregation.\n\nAnother change in American society that had a profound impact on the\naesthetic advancement of African-Americans at the time of Locke's\npublication of The New Negro was the Great Migration. One\nmajor consequence of \u201cthat shifting of the Negro\npopulation\u201d was that it \u201cmade the Negro problem no longer\nexclusively or even predominantly Southern\u201d (NN 5). Locke did\nnot however regard the cause of the great migration as chiefly racial;\nthat is, escape from the segregation of the South was not the major\nmotivation behind the mass African-American exodus from the South to\nthe North and Mid-West. Instead,\n\nThe tide of Negro migration, northward and city-ward, is not to be\nfully explained as a blind flood started by the demands of war\nindustry coupled with the shutting off of foreign migration, or by the\npressure of poor crops coupled with increased social terrorism in\ncertain sections of the South and Southwest\u2026The wash and rush\nof this human tide on the beach line of the northern city centers is\nto be explained primarily in terms of a new vision of opportunity, of\nsocial and economic freedom, of a spirit to seize, even in the face of\nan extortionate and heavy toll, a chance for the improvement of\nconditions. (NN 6)\n\n\nThe Great Migration brought with it a need for a plurality of social\nadjustments as the droves of African-Americans flooded into Northern\ncities. Principal among this was the realization that the Negro\nwas\n\nrapidly in process of class differentiation, [and] if it ever was\nwarrantable to regard and treat the Negro en masse it is\nbecoming with every day less possible, more unjust and more\nridiculous. (NN 5\u20136)\n\n\nNegro life in America according to Locke is comprised of many diverse\nelements. The plurality of groups that congregated in places like\nDetroit, Chicago, Philadelphia and Harlem all with varying motivations\nand group specific aims constituted some of the largest concentrations\nof diverse segments of the Negro population. These circumstances\ncoupled with the oppressive effects of prejudice forced myriad sectors\nof the African-American population to discover and interact with one\nanother. Prior to that Locke claims that \n\nit must be admitted that the American Negroes have been a race more in\nname than in fact, or to be exact, more in sentiment than in\nexperience. The chief bond between them has been that of a common\ncondition rather than a common consciousness; a problem in common\nrather than a life in common. (NN 6\u20137)\n\n\nLocke explains that in part the artistic endeavors of the Negro have\nfailed to achieve universal resonance because the Negro himself has\nbeen so poorly understood. He readily admits that \u201c[i]t does not\nfollow that if the Negro were better known, he would be better liked\nor better treated[,]\u201d and goes on to note that despite this fact\n\u201cmutual understanding is basic for any subsequent cooperation\nand adjustment\u201d predicated upon, or in pursuit of an\nunderstanding of the universality of Negro experiences as expressed in\nart. Moreover, \n\neffort towards this will at least have the effect of remedying in\nlarge part what has been the most unsatisfactory feature of our\npresent stage of race relations in America, namely the fact that the\nmore intelligent and representative elements of the two race groups\nhave at so many points got quite out of vital touch with one another\n(NN 8\u20139)\n\n\nAnd in addressing that crucial fact, such efforts may go a long way\ntowards facilitating an appreciation of Negro art as expressive both\nof the peculiar racial, ethnic, and cultural experiences of\nAfrican-Americans, and as expressive of ubiquitous aspects of human\nexperience. It is a mere \u201cfiction\u2026that the life of the\nraces is separate,\u201d and a dangerously divisive one at that,\n\u201c[t]he fact is that they have touched too closely at the\nunfavorable and too lightly at the favorable levels\u201d (NN 9).\nHence, it is not simply a failure of contact, but a failure of the\nright sort of contact that accounts for the under appreciation of the\naesthetic life of black peoples.\n\nFor his part, Locke argues, the \u201cNew Negro\u201d in recognizing\n\u201cthe necessity for fuller, truer self-expression,\u2026[and]\nthe realization of the unwisdom of allowing discrimination to\nsegregate him mentally, and a counter attitude to cramp and fetter his\nown living\u201d has played a vital role in demolishing \u201cthe\n\u2018spite-wall\u2019 that the intellectuals built over the\n\u2018color-line[.]\u2019\u201d (NN, 9\u201310). Life for the\nNegro in the early 1920's was steadily progressing toward the ideals\nof American democracy. The Negro of the time was also characterized by\na new vein; one around which there was a growing consensus primarily\nof feeling and attitude; rather than opinion or program. As Locke has\nit:\n\nUp to the present one may adequately describe the Negro's \u2018inner\nobjectives\u2019 as an attempt to repair a damaged group psychology\nand reshape a warped social perspective. Their realization has\nacquired a new mentality for the American Negro. And as it matures we\nbegin to see its effects; at first, negative, iconoclastic, and then\npositive and constructive. In this new group psychology we note the\nlapse of sentimental appeal, then the development of a more positive\nself-respect and self-reliance; the repudiation of social dependence,\nand then the gradual recovery from hyper-sensitiveness and\n\u2018touchy\u2019 nerves, the repudiation of the double standard of\njudgment with its special philanthropic allowances and in the sturdier\ndesire for objective and scientific appraisal; and finally the rise\nfrom social disillusionment to race pride, from the sense of social\ndebt to the responsibilities of social contribution, and offsetting\nthe necessary working commonsense acceptance of restricted conditions,\nthe belief in ultimate esteem and recognition. Therefore, the Negro\ntoday wishes to be known for what he is, even in his faults and\nshortcomings, and scorns a craven and precarious survival at the price\nof seeming to be what he is not (NN 11).\n\n\nLocke ends his exposition of what is characteristic of the New Negro\nwith the observation that the reception of black aesthetic products is\nan experiment in democracy. As African-American art resists\nghettoization and increasingly makes its presence felt in the American\nartistic mainstream it seeks to establish itself as a subset of\nAmerican art; rather than, the totality of Negro American art. And\nsince, according to Locke,\n\n[d]emocracy itself is obstructed and stagnated to the extent that any\nof its channels are closed\u2026the choice is not between one way\nfor the Negro and another way for the rest, but between American\ninstitutions frustrated on the one hand and American ideals\nprogressively fulfilled and realized on the other. (NN 12)\n\n\nThe North American Negro artist in being \u2018new\u2019 is a living\ninstantiation of the fact that no culture, people, race, or society is\na static one. Such entities are always in process of transformation,\nand always a composite of myriad cultural, ethnic, racial, and social\ninfluences. The emergence of the new is at once a presentation of what\nhas been and an indication of what the future may hold. This is a\ndeeply pragmatic current running through Locke's aesthetic philosophy.\nLocke is later critical of the Harlem Renaissance because it failed to\nsustain a cyclical process of rebirth. In the years following the\nheight of the Harlem Renaissance he remarked later that that a new\nNegro must be born every decade or two.\n",
