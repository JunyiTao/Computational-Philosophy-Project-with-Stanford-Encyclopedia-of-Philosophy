    "main_text": "Paradoxes || The Newcomb Paradox\n3.3 The Newcomb Paradox\n\nThis thought experiment involves a player playing a game against a\nfortune teller. In this game there are two boxes of which the player\nmay select one or both. One of the two boxes is transparent,\nlet\u2019s call it \\(A\\), the other is opaque, call it \\(B\\). Before\nthe player makes her choice the fortune teller, based on her\nprediction of the player\u2019s choice, puts a certain amount of\nmoney in one or both boxes. When the player makes her choice, the\nfollowing information is available to her: 1) Up to now the fortune\nteller has been able to predict the future with absolute certainty and\nhas foreseen what other players have chosen. Moreover: 2) sometimes\nthe fortune teller puts 1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\), but only if\nthe player selects box \\(B\\) and does not take both boxes, whereas she\nputs 1,000 dollars in box \\(A\\), regardless of whether the player\nchooses box \\(A\\) or both boxes. So when the player has to choose\nbetween the two boxes, it is already determined whether box \\(B\\)\ncontains 1,000,000 or nothing. If the fortune teller is correct in her\nprediction, the player will get 1,000,000 dollars, only if she selects\nbox \\(B\\); however, if the player wants to earn 1,001,000 dollars and\nselects both boxes, she will miss most of the fortune and only receive\n1,000 dollars, which she can already see in box \\(A\\).\n\nThis puzzle was originally proposed by William Newcomb but never\npublished. After its first publication by Robert Nozick (1969) it was\nmuch discussed within decision theory. But it has also been debated in\nthe context of backward causation, because it gives a nice\nillustration of some of the philosophical problems that arise in\nrelation to backward causation. In this debate it has been used to\ndemonstrate various claims: that backward causation is impossible or\nthat it implies fatalism or determinism. The earliest discussion of\nsome of the consequences for backward causation and free will can be\nfound in George Schlesinger (1974) and in an exchange between Don\nLocke (1978, 1979) and Andr\u00e9 Gallois (1979). Here Schlesinger\nargued that there are good arguments for taking both boxes, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), and equally good arguments for taking only box B, whereas Locke\nheld that backward causation is irrelevant and the player ought to\ntake both boxes. However, Gallois believed that Locke\u2019s\narguments for taking both boxes are misconceived.\n\nTwo opposite arguments for what the player should decide can be given.\nAssuming the player has a free will it seems rational to say that the\nfortune teller cannot in principle predict what the player is going to\ndo. When the player makes her choice, it is already determinate\nwhether box \\(B\\) contains 1,000,000 dollars or nothing. Therefore her\nchoice cannot be affected by the fortune teller\u2019s prediction,\nand she would be better off by selecting both boxes, hoping that there\nalready is 1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\). The other argument\nmaintains that based on previous experience\u2014which tells us that\nthe fortune teller has always been correct about her\npredictions\u2014it would be most rational of the player to take only\n\\(B\\). From here philosophers have disagreed about the strength of the\nargument. One could insist that fortune teller can predict the\nplayer\u2019s choice only based on relevant knowledge of that\nperson\u2019s past or present behavior or state of mind\n(compatibilism). Alternatively one could argue that the fortune teller\ncould have such a perfect knowledge only from information about the\nplayer\u2019s choice in the future.\n\nNevertheless, it has been argued that the Newcomb paradox demonstrates\nthat backward causation is impossible. George Schlesinger (1980:75\nff.), for instance, imagines a perfect judge who is allowed to check\nthe two boxes after the fortune teller has placed the money in the\nboxes, but before the player has made her choice. It is clear that if\nthe perfect judge then informs the player about the content of the two\nboxes, we have a case where the fortune teller\u2019s prediction\ncauses the player to select both boxes as she is informed about the\n1,000,000 dollars in box \\(B\\). Indeed this would be a clear example\nof Black\u2019s case of bilking. But Schlesinger also argues that the\nsame holds true, if the perfect judge merely knows it without\ninforming the player. However, it is difficult to understand why this\nshould be the conclusion. If we assume that the player has a free will\nand that the fortune teller is able to predict the result of the\nplayer\u2019s choice, it seems most rational for the player to learn\nfrom experience and opt for box \\(B\\) only rather than being greedy\nand take both boxes. As long as the perfect judge is silent, his\nknowledge about the content of the two boxes seems not to be able to\ninfluence the player\u2019s decision. Nor does the player\u2019s\npossible knowledge of the existence of a perfect judge seem to have\nany effect on her decision, because this information does not add\nanything to the information she already has; namely, that the fortune\nteller has placed the money in the boxes before she makes her decision\nand that the fortune teller has never failed to predict the outcome in\nadvance.\n\nAnother problem is that the paradox seems to indicate that backward\ncausation implies fatalism and determinism. If backward causation is\npossible we cannot have a free will. If the result of the\nplayer\u2019s action can be predicted, because it is already true\ntoday what the player will choose tomorrow, she cannot be free to\npick. If the fortune teller already knows that the player will choose\nboth boxes, this has to be true, and the player cannot do otherwise.\nAnd if the fortune teller already knows that the player will select\nonly box \\(B\\), this has to be true, and the player cannot but do it.\nHowever, this argument seems to be misguided.\n\nThe intuitive strength of the argument stems from the general\nassumption that backward causation presupposes an ontologically closed\nfuture\u2014a metaphysical position about time usually named\neternalism. Hence it is not an argument only against backward\ncausation but against eternalism as well. Suppose it is now already\ntrue or false what is going to happen tomorrow; then there must be\nsome future truth-makers that determine that it is now already true or\nfalse what is going to happen. The consequence seems to be that what\nthe player is going to do tomorrow is already determined today; hence\nthe player cannot do otherwise tomorrow than what is true today.\nTherefore the player cannot have a free choice, and it seems futile of\nher to make any decision. \n\nHowever, it can be maintained that the player still has her free\nchoice. Nothing around the fortune teller causes the player to make a\nparticular decision. The player is as free as she would be with no\nprediction. What the fortune teller is able to predict is the result\nof the player\u2019s choice. The choice itself may nevertheless be\nfree. Moreover, unless one replaces forward causation with backward\ncausation, one cannot argue that it is the outcome of the\nplayer\u2019s choice that causes her decision. The statement about\nthe outcome of her decision is true, according to the fortune teller,\nbecause of the particular decision the player makes; a statement about\nthe player\u2019s decision is not true because of the outcome of her\ndecision. Consequently, even with respect to the fortune teller, the\nplayer\u2019s decision may be regarded as free in the sense that\nnothing in its past nor in its future determines what the decision\nactually becomes. The reason why the fortune teller is able to make\nher prediction could be that the player\u2019s choice instigates an\ninformation channel backwards in time.\n\nPhilosophers who reject eternalism may not leave the discussion here.\nThey could argue that it may very well be the case that the\nplayer\u2019s choice is neither causally determined by past events\nnor by future events. Yet, eternalism implies that the player\u2019s\ndecision is ontologically determinate before it is made, since it is\ntrue today what she will decide tomorrow. Therefore she is not as free\nas she would be if the future is ontologically open, i.e., it is not\nyet ontologically determinate what the future is going to be,\nincluding the player\u2019s choice. The eternalist may attempt to\nrebut these critics by arguing that as long as the player\u2019s\ndecision is not causally determined, it is free in any possible sense.\n\n",
