    "main_text": "Special Topics || Computation\n5.3 Computation\n\nUntil fairly recently, the subject of computation did not receive much\nattention in the philosophy of mathematics. This may be due in part to\nthe fact that in Hilbert-style axiomatizations of number theory,\ncomputation is reduced to proof in Peano Arithmetic. But this\nsituation has changed in recent years. It seems that along with the\nincreased importance of computation in mathematical practice,\nphilosophical reflections on the notion of computation will occupy a\nmore prominent place in the philosophy of mathematics in the years to\ncome.\n\nChurch\u2019s Thesis occupies a central place in computability\ntheory. It says that every algorithmically computable function on the\nnatural numbers can be computed by a Turing machine.\n\nAs a principle, Church\u2019s Thesis has a somewhat curious status.\nIt appears to be a basic principle. On the one hand, the\nprinciple is almost universally held to be true. On the other hand, it\nis hard to see how it can be mathematically proved. The reason is that\nits antecedent contains an informal notion (algorithmic computability)\nwhereas its consequent contains a purely mathematical notion (Turing\nmachine computability). Mathematical proofs can only connect purely\nmathematical notions\u2014or so it seems. The received view was that\nour evidence for Church\u2019s Thesis is quasi-empirical. Attempts to\nfind convincing counterexamples to Church\u2019s Thesis have come to\nnaught. Independently, various proposals have been made to\nmathematically capture the algorithmically computable functions on the\nnatural numbers. Instead of Turing machine computability, the notions\nof general recursiveness, Herbrand-G\u00f6del computability,\nlambda-definability\u2026 have been proposed. But these mathematical\nnotions all turn out to be equivalent. Thus, to use G\u00f6delian\nterminology, we have accumulated extrinsic evidence for the truth of\nChurch\u2019s Thesis.\n\nKreisel pointed out long ago that even if a thesis cannot be formally\nproved, it may still be possible to obtain intrinsic evidence for it\nfrom a rigorous but informal analysis of intuitive notions (Kreisel\n1967). Kreisel calls these exercises in informal rigour.\nDetailed scholarship by Sieg revealed that the seminal article (Turing\n1936) constitutes an exquisite example of just this sort of analysis\nof the intuitive concept of algorithmic computability (Sieg 1994).\n\nCurrently, the most active subjects of investigation in the domain of\nfoundations and philosophy of computation appear to be the following.\nFirst, energy has been invested in developing theories of algorithmic\ncomputation on structures other than the natural numbers. In\nparticular, efforts have been made to obtain analogues of\nChurch\u2019s Thesis for algorithmic computation on various\nstructures. In this context, substantial progress has been made in\nrecent decades in developing a theory of effective computation on the\nreal numbers (Pour-El 1999). Second, attempts have been made to\nexplicate notions of computability other than algorithmic\ncomputability by humans. One area of particular interest here is the\narea of quantum computation (Deutsch et al.\n2000).\n",
