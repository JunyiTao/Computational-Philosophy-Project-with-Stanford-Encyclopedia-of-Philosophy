    "main_text": "Special Issues in the Philosophy of Science || Explanation and Understanding\n4.1 Explanation and Understanding\n\nWe seek explanations for an epistemic benefit, but how should we think\nabout that benefit? We noted above (Section 1.2) that philosophers\nsuch as Hempel have significant reservations about thinking about the\nbenefit in terms of understanding. As they point out, just as a\nmistaken explanation can generate a \u201cfeeling\u201d of\nunderstanding in some people, so too an accurate explanation might\nleave people cold.\n\nIn response to this concern, others note that the feeling of\nunderstanding (or the phenomenology of understanding) should not be\nconfused with the epistemic state itself, any more than the feeling of\nknowing should be confused with the epistemic state of knowledge (de\nRegt 2004, 2017). But even if this move is granted, and we think of\nunderstanding as a full-bodied epistemic state and not a mere feeling,\nthe relationship between explanation and understanding remains\ncontroversial.\n\nAccording to what we might call an \u201cunderstanding-first\u201d\napproach to the relationship, thinking about the epistemology of\nunderstanding is indispensable for thinking about what makes for a\ngood explanation. More exactly, because we seem to assess the goodness\nor badness of an explanation in terms of its ability to generate\nunderstanding, understanding is in some sense conceptually prior to,\nor more basic than, the notion of explanation. Thus intuitions about\nunderstanding are often taken to be diagnostic of the goodness (the\nexplanatoriness) of an explanation (Wilkenfeld 2013; cf. Wilkenfeld\n& Lombrozo 2020), and if we can think of a case where all of the\nconditions for the theory of explanation are met, but understanding\ndoes not result, that is a reason to reject the sufficiency of the\nconditions (see, e.g., Woodward 2003: 195, in diagnosing\nHempel\u2019s view). Similarly, if we have understanding in ways not\nsanctioned by the theory, that is reason to think the conditions are\nnot necessary. More generally, an advocate of the\n\u201cunderstanding-first\u201d approach would likely concur with\nPaul Humphreys\u2019s claim that:\n\n\nScientific understanding provides a far richer terrain than does\nscientific explanation and the latter is best viewed as a vehicle to\nunderstanding, rather than an end in itself. (Humphreys 2000: 267; cf.\nPotochnik 2017: ch. 5)\n\n\nAgainst understanding-first approaches, there are\n\u201cdebunking\u201d approaches according to which understanding is\nof little if any help to accounts of explanation. (More positively,\nthese might simply be considered \u201cexplanation-first\u201d\napproaches.) Thus Khalifa argues that attempts to revive understanding\nas a central notion in the philosophy of science have amounted to\nlittle more than a repackaging of existing models of explanation\n(Khalifa 2012, 2017b: ch. 3), and that strictly speaking all one needs\nfor a plausible account of understanding is a plausible account of\nwhat counts as a good or correct explanation, combined with a\nplausible account of knowledge. Understanding therefore amounts to\nknowing a correct explanation. But then nothing new or\nspecial is needed to theorize about understanding; our accounts of\nexplanation and our theories of knowledge do all the important\ntheoretical work (see especially Khalifa 2017b; cf. Kelp 2015).\n\nSimilarly, consider the following attempt, from Bradford Skow, to\ncharacterize the relationship between explanation and\nunderstanding:\n\n\nSomething E is an explanation of why Q only if\nsomeone who possesses E understands why Q. (Skow\n2018: 214)\n\n\nThis condition on explanation cannot help us as theorists, Skow\nargues, because it is not even true. Thus suppose we construe\n\u201cpossessing\u201d an explanation as knowing an\nexplanation. Plugged into the formula, the result is that one cannot\nknow an explanation of why Q unless that knowledge constitutes\nan understanding of why Q. But, plausibly, we can know an\nexplanation of why Q without understanding why Q. For\nexample, someone can know why the litmus paper turned\nred\u2014because it was dipped in acid\u2014without understanding\nwhy it turned red (Skow 2018: 215). This suggests it takes\nmore to understand why p than simply to know why p. In the\ncase of the litmus paper, Skow claims one also needs to appreciate\nhow the acid turns the paper red, or why it turns it\nred.\n\nOpinions differ about the force of such examples. According to some,\nto require that understanding why p involves knowledge of mechanisms\nor deeper processes in this way would annihilate most of our everyday\nunderstanding (Grimm 2019a). Thus I can apparently understand why my\neyes are watering\u2014because I am chopping onions\u2014without\nappreciating anything about the mechanism or connection that underlies\nthe watering. Others argue that there is indeed understanding in these\ncases, although perhaps not a lot (Sliwa 2015).\n",
