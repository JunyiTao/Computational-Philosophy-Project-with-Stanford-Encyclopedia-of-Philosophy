    "main_text": "Epistemological Approaches\n4. Epistemological Approaches\n\nThere are have been four versions of the epistemological approach,\neach of which attempts to define how an cognitively ideal agent\narrives at warranted conclusions, given an initial input. The first\ntwo of these, John L. Pollock\u2019s theory of defeasible reasoning\nand the theory of semantic inheritance networks, are explicitly\ncomputational in nature. They take as input a complex, structured\nstate, representing the data available to the agent, and they define a\nprocedure by which new conclusions can be warranted. The third\napproach, based on the theory of belief change (the AGM model)\ndeveloped by Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson\n(Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1982), instead lays\ndown a set of conditions that an ideal process of belief change ought\nto satisfy. The AGM model can be used to define a nonmonotonic\nconsequence relation that is temporary and local. This can represent\nreasoning that is hypothetically or counterfactually defeasible, in\nthe sense that what \u201cfollows\u201d from a conjunctive\nproposition \\((p \\amp q)\\) need not be a superset of what\n\u201cfollows\u201d from \\(p\\) alone. The fourth approach is that of\nformal argumentation theory, in which defeat is treated as a\nrelation between arguments within a dialogue\n",
