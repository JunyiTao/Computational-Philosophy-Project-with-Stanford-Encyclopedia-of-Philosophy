    "main_text": "Justice for Bodin: Open and Closed Questions || Closed questions\n6.3 Closed questions\nSometimes historical research progresses by leaps and bounds\ninstead of a gradual and steady evolution. Thanks to new research\n(Fontana 2009) we are now in a position to settle on certain issues in\nBodin\u2019s life that have remained matters of conjecture until quite\nrecently, such as his supposed visit to Geneva in 1552 (on which, see\nbelow).  Biographers have been faced with a series of problems\nbecause, throughout his life, he was regularly confused with other\nindividuals also called Jean Bodin, not least within his own family:\nhe was the fourth of seven children, the second of whome was also\ncalled Jean (Levron 1950, 14). For this reason, he has often been\nassigned roles by historians which he may not have played.  He has\nbeen conflated, for instance, with a certain Jean Bodin arrested in\ntwo trials for heresy in Paris, one in 1547 and the other in 1548\n(Weiss 1889, 17\u20138; Naef; Droz; but see Levron 1948).  He has\nalso been confused with Jean Bodin de La Bodini\u00e8re or\nMontguichet who, like our Jean Bodin, was an Angevin and a\ncommissioner for the reformation of forests in Normandy, as well as a\nmember of the household of the duke d\u2019Alen\u00e7on\n(cf. Chauvir\u00e9, 33\u20134; Cornu 1907, 109\u2013111 ; Holt 1986,\n41).  Among the avocats of the Parlement of Paris who swore\nan oath to uphold Catholism in 1562, there were two Jean Bodins, one\nof whom was ours (Delachenal 1885, 405\u20136).  Someone called Jean Bodin\nwas arrested at the priory of Saint-Denis-de-la-Chatre, rue\nSaint-Barth\u00e9lemy in Paris on March 6, 1569, accused of being of\nthe new opinion\u2019.  He was released on August 23, 1570 following the\nedict of pacification of Saint-Germain (Weiss 1923, 87-9; Droz 1948,\n79; Boucher 1983).  But this cannot be our Jean Bodin (De Caprariis\n1959, 325).  None of the various Jean Bodins of whom we have knowledge\naround 1569 \u2014 the student at Angers, the priest at Bourgueil in\nthe parish of Saint-Aubin du Pavoil near Segr\u00e9, or the merchant\nat St-Maurice \u2014 correspond to the Jean Bodin in whom we are\ninterested (Levron 1948, 73\u20134).  Nor ashould we identify Jean Bodin\nthe philosopher with his various namesakes (Couzinet 1996, 240) who\nwere implicated in the trial of La M\u00f4le and Coconnas in 1574\n(Holt 1986, 41) or accompanied Brisson on a mission in 1581\n(Moreau-Reibel 1933, 258), or got mixed up in the Champvallon affair\nof the following year (Radouant 1970, 45) or were suspected of having\nparticipated in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth I of England\n(Rose 1980, 215\u20136).\nEqually, there is no tangible or demonstrable proof to support the\nsupposed Protestant leanings of Bodin.  Roger Chauvir\u00e9 (1914,\n24) speculated, on the basis of his hypothetical stay in Geneva in\n1552, that he had perhaps converted to the new faith.  This particular\nsupposition is linked to another, more general one, that Bodin had a\ntruly reformed religiosity, coexisting with his other judaising\ntendencies and inclinations towards natural religion. This is why\nthere is a persistent tendency among certain historians to perceive\nhim as a dissimulating Protestant and \u2018Nicodemite\u2019.\nFollowing Naef and Droz, they believe that Bodin can be identified\nwith \u2018Jehan Bodin de Sainct-Amand diocese de Bourges\u2019\n(following Bordier, who, however, provides no references to Jean\nBodin, author of the Republic) who spent time in Geneva in\n1552, asking to be received as inhabitant there, who married\nTyph\u00e8ne Renault and had an argument with J\u00e9r\u00f4me\nBolsec (Naef and Droz, 83) and who even became a minister of the Holy\nWord (Weiss, contradicted by Naef, 153; but see Droz, 83).  All these\nhypotheses, however, have been undermined now that Letizia Fontana\n(2009) has demonstrated that the Jean Bodin who was present in Geneva\nin 1552 cannot possibly have been the philosopher. That said, it still\nremains possible that Bodin occasionally felt sympathy, on the\nreligious grounds, towards Protestantism and Protestants in general,\nthough this stopped short of adherence to the confession of the\nReformed faith.  Such an attitude could often be found among moderate\nCatholics, men of letters, jurists, writers and even theologians and\nwas not in conflict with Bodin\u2019s severely negative assessment \u2014\non a purely political level \u2014 of the Huguenots as a result of\ntheir raising arms against their sovereign.\n",
