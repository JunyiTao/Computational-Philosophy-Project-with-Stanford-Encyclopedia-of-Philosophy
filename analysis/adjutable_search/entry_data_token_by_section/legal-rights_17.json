    "main_text": "Legal Rights as Reasons || Rights as Reasons for Duties\n8.4 Rights as Reasons for Duties\n\nAt times, rights justify correlative duties (MacCormick 1977:\n199\u2013208; Dworkin 1977: 171; Raz 1986: 167; Feinberg 1992: 156).\nThat is, claim-rights are reasons for duties as well for excluding\nreasons against them. And, in the absence of countervailing reasons,\nrights justify such duties (Raz 1970: 226\u2013227; 1986: 171). Some\nargue that in duty-based normative systems (for example Jewish law,\nsee Cover 1987), the direction of the justification\u2014from right\nto duty\u2014can, in principle, run in reverse, that is from duty to\nright (Waldron 1990: 69\u201373; Kramer 1998: 37\u201339). In any\ncase, the normative priority of rights over duties may (Waldron 1984a:\n12; 1990: 84) or may not (Kramer 1998: 35\u201340; Simmonds 1998:\n158\u2013165) refute Hohfeldian correlativity. \n\nRelatedly, the same claim-right seemingly can count in favor of\ndifferent and changing duties, for instance given changes in factual\ncircumstances. For example, the right to education is a reason for\ndifferent duties in the twenty-first century than it counted in favor\nof in the nineteenth century. Moreover, in practice legal rights are\noften the instruments of legal change, justifying new previously\nunrecognized duties (Raz 1970: 225\u2013227; 1994: 269). This\ndynamism arguably cuts against the seemingly more frozen view of the\nnormative relation between rights and duties implied by Hohfeldian\ncorrelativity (Raz 1970: 226; 1986: 185\u2013186). In addition,\nright-dynamism undercuts the Hohfeldian notion that what individuates\nany specific claim-right is the content of its specific correlative\nduty. Among possible responses on behalf of Hohfeldians is that so\ncalled \u201cdynamic rights\u201d are in fact only inchoate rights\n(Kramer 1998: 41\u201348). \n",
