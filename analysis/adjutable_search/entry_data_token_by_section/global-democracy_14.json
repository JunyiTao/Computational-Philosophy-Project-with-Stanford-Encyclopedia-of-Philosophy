    "main_text": "Persistent Criticisms and Future Research || Realism and Global Politics\n4.2 Global Democracy, Legitimacy, and Justice\n\n\nIt is not just IR scholars who have accused global democrats of\nfailing to deal adequately with issues of power. Increasingly within\nthe broader field of normative international political theory, there is\nrecognition that questions of power and conflict have been relegated in\nfavor of global justice (Beitz 1979). Of course, global democrats\nare fundamentally interested in how transnational decision-making is\nexercised and who has a democratic say in the formulation of rules and\nnorms. But these issues are often eclipsed by issues of poverty,\nresource distribution, and inequality (Pogge 1992).\n\n\nWhen global democrats tackle the notion of power, they do so through a\nspecific lens: they are interested, predominantly, in how \u2018the\npeople\u2019 can collectively rule themselves and potentially check\nthe exercise of arbitrary power (Bohman 2007).  Recently, several\nscholars have complained that this focus is too narrow to take proper\nconsideration of how power can be legitimated within the global\nsystem. Macdonald and Ronzoni (2012), following in the footsteps of\nBernard Williams, suggest that legitimacy may be a value separable\nfrom\u2014and not reducible to\u2014democracy or justice. As such,\nwe need to think about different ways of legitimating global power\nthat take seriously the unique context of world politics.  This might\nentail looking at values such as stability, sociological acceptance,\njuridification, or arbitration. Analyzing how these standards foster\nlegitimacy in transnational institutions may actually help shed light\non the fundamental constitutive features of the global political order\n(Macdonald and Ronzoni 2012, 525) and the limits of global\ndemocratization.\n\n\nAt any rate, much work remains to think about how justice, democracy,\nand legitimacy intersect and diverge in both theoretical and empirical\nterms (Dingwerth 2014). This will entail looking at whether the\ncurrent arrangements of international institutions are sufficiently\nstrong to trigger demands of justice, democracy, or both (Nagel 2005;\nSangiovanni 2007). It will also require analysis of legitimacy as a\nseparable virtue of global political institutions with its own\ncharacter and composition that may only tangentially relate to\ndemocracy. Finally, questions remain over whether a demos\u2014a\ngroup of individuals due democratic standing in the exercise of\npolitical power\u2014can emerge across national borders in coherent\nand stable ways. These future directions for research\u2014as well as\nmany of the other issues addressed in this review\u2014should ensure\nthat global democracy remains an active, vibrant, and important field\nof practice and study in years to come.\n",
