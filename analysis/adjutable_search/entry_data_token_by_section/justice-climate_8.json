    "main_text": "Responsibilities || The Climate Action Question\n5.1 The Climate Action Question\n\nConsider the first two questions. Very often these are treated\ntogether, but they are not necessarily the same. One might think, for\nexample, that one agent has a responsibility to mitigate (on the\ngrounds that doing so would be an effective way of making a\nsignificant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) but that others\nhave a duty to bear some, or all, of the costs. In such a case, then,\nour answer to the Climate Action Question might be that X should\nmitigate, but our answer to the Burden-Sharing Question might be that\nY should bear the cost involved in X\u2019s mitigating.\nTo illustrate: one might think that developing countries should\nmitigate and should use clean technology instead of fossil fuels, but\none might also think that the cost of the clean technology should be\nshouldered by others.\n\nTo give another illustration: one might think that current generations\nshould mitigate climate change aggressively but that they can pass on\nsome of the costs of doing so to future generations (Rendall 2011). (A\nversion of this position is defended by Broome [2012: 47\u201348],\nand is introduced\n below\u2014Section 8.)\n\nOf course, even though the questions are distinct this does not entail\nthat they should be treated wholly separately. One might think, for\nexample, that X should mitigate but only if others pay at least\nsome (or even all) of the costs, and that if sufficient financial\nsupport is not forthcoming then X is not obligated. With this\nin mind, it is appropriate to turn to the Burden-Sharing Question. A\nconsiderable literature has developed around the question of who\nshould bear the costs of combating climate change.\n",
