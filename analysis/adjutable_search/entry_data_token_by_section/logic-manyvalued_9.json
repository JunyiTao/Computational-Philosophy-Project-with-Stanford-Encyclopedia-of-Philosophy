Applications of Many-Valued Logic\n\n\nMany-valued logic was motivated in part by philosophical goals which\nwere never achieved, and in part by formal considerations concerning\nfunctional completeness. In the earlier years of development, this\ncaused some doubts about the usefulness of MVL. In the meantime,\nhowever, interesting applications were found in diverse fields. Some of\nthese shall now be mentioned.\n\n4.1 Applications to Linguistics\n4.2 Applications to Logic\n4.3 Applications to Philosophical Problems\n4.4 Applications to Hardware Design\n4.5 Applications to Artificial Intelligence\n4.6 Applications to Mathematics\n\n",
