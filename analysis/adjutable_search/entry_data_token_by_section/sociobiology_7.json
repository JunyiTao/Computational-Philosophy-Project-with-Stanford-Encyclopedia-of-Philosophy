    "main_text": "Central criticisms of Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology || Behavioral vs. Psychological Focus\n5. Conclusion\n\nSociobiology, despite its complicated history, remains of interest to\nphilosophers and has some import for certain important philosophical\ndebates. One such question is whether human beings should be\nunderstood to have a nature, a set of traits which for Wilson\nin particular are those heritable traits that have been fixed in the\npopulation by natural selection (Wilson, 1978). Consequently, this\n\u2018nature\u2019 can be discovered and understood using the\nstandard adaptationist methods used in other areas of biology. Most\nimportantly, Wilson suggests that some of the characteristics that\nmake up human nature are specifically behavioral.\n\nQuite apart from the fundamental interest of the question of whether\nthere is a human nature, the issue is important because it might have\na significant moral or social upshot: what society we can have, and\nindeed what society we should have might depend on what human nature\nis like (Wilson, 1978). It was this concern that ignited the\n\u201csociobiology wars\u201d in the early days after the\npublication of Sociobiology. The \u201cSociobiology Study\nGroup\u201d was concerned that Wilson was trying to argue that many\nproblematic or harmful features of current societies, such as\noppressive gender roles, negative race relations and interpersonal\naggression might be unchangeable (Sociobiology Study Group of Science\nfor the People, 1976). Philosophers of biology have strongly resisted\nthe idea that humans have a \u2018nature\u2019 in anything like the\ntraditional sense of a fixed essence (Hull, 1986; Lewens, 2012; Lloyd\nand Crowley, 2002) but there is also some debate about whether humans\ncould be said to have a nature in the sense of a set of evolved traits\nin much the way that Wilson suggests (e.g. see Machery, 2008, 2012;\nfor a critique see Powell, 2012). Philosophers in this area are\ninstead focusing on notions of human nature that take into account the\nflexibility of human development and the capacity of human beings to\nconstruct their own development and hence their own\n\u2018nature\u2019 (Griffiths, 2009; Ramsey, 2013; Stotz, 2012).\n\nAnother hope on the part of philosophers is that understanding the\nevolution of cognition might give us some insight into the nature of\ncertain human psychological traits that have particular philosophical\ninterest. One such trait is our moral psychology. Moral psychology is\nof interest to philosophers who hold naturalistic views of ethics\nbecause they believe moral values depend in part on features of that\npsychology; understanding that psychology and how it evolved would\ngive us insight into what the correct moral values are. Understanding\nthe origins of human moral psychology might also help answer certain\nmetaethical questions (Street, 2006). As Wilson hoped, scientists\nworking in disciplines which are the modern descendants of\nsociobiology have contributed to our understanding of the way that\nnorms, including moral norms, might have become established in human\nevolution (see, for example, Henrich and Boyd, 2001; Sripada, 2005).\nPhilosophers still strongly disagree, however, on how the evolution of\nmoral psychology, especially for the acquisition of norms, should be\nunderstood (Dwyer, 2006; Sripada and Stich, 2006; Sterelny, 2010).\n\nOther debates surrounding sociobiology are still ongoing. For example,\nwhile methodological adaptationism has become and remained the\nstandard approach in behavioral ecology, not all philosophers are\nconvinced that this is an entirely benign practice \u2013 there are\nstill concerns about the assumptions that this methodology requires\n(see, for example, Lewens, 2009; Lloyd, 2005). Similarly, there has\nbeen an increasing interest in the role of culture in the nature and\nhistory of human behavior; work studying the evolution of culture has\nincreased since Lumsden and Wilson (1981) published their book.\nPhilosophers and scientists are still addressing questions about how\nand how far cultural traits can be said to evolve; and, as discussed\nabove, whether traits that have evolved in this way can be considered\nadaptations in any sense (Driscoll, 2011; Fracchia and Lewontin, 1999,\n2005; Henrich et al., 2008; Sperber, 2006; Sterelny, 2006).\n",
