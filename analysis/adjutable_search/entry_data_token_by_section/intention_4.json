    "main_text": "Intentions as Plans\n5. Intention and Belief\n\nAcknowledging these problems, some philosophers turn back to Davidson\nand the project of reducing intention to desire and means-end belief\n(see, especially, Ridge 1998; Sinhababu 2013; and, for discussion,\nMulder 2018). But others see a promise of unity in the\nidea\u2014influentially proposed by Elizabeth Anscombe (1963, pp.\n11\u201315) and Stuart Hampshire (1959, pp. 95, 102)\u2014that when\nS is doing A intentionally, S knows that\nshe is doing A. What is more, acting for a reason, in a sense\nthat contrasts with mere purposive behavior (of the sort\ncharacteristic of other animals), essentially involves such knowledge:\nin acting for a reason, I know an explanation of what I am doing that\ncites that reason, and therefore know that I am doing it. That is why,\nfor Anscombe, the question \u2018Why?\u2019 is \u2018given\napplication\u2019 by the agent. Intentional action turns on knowing\nthe answer to that question.\n\nThis picture raises many difficulties, and needs considerable\nrefinement and defence. (For variations, see Velleman 1989; Velleman\n2000; Setiya 2007a, Part One; R\u00f6dl 2007, Ch. 2; Setiya 2016b.)\nSome will resist the claim that acting for a reason is acting with\nself-knowledge\u2014though it is important to stress that the\nknowledge attributed here need not involve conscious belief. There is\nalso disagreement about the kind of explanation involved in giving the\nreasons for which one acts (Wilson 1989, Ch. 7; Ginet 1990, Ch. 6;\nDancy 2000; Davis 2005; Alvarez 2010; Setiya 2011). But if the picture\nis basically right, it suggests that the unity of intention can be\nfound in knowledge or belief about action. Assuming that knowledge\nentails belief, the basic thought is that intention in action involves\nthe belief that one is doing A. Doing something for a reason\ninvolves a belief about one\u2019s reason for doing it that\nconstitutes intention in action. And prospective intention, or\nintention for the future, involves a belief about what one is going to\ndo and why. The idea that intention involves belief is what unifies\nintentional action, prospective intention, and intention-with-which.\n(On an alternative view, which may be Anscombe\u2019s, intention\ncontrasts with belief: they correspond to radically different kinds of\nknowledge. See the treatment of mistakes below.)\n\nThe claim that intention entails belief\u2014most commonly, that if\none intends to do A, one believes that one is going to do\nit\u2014is widespread among those who draw no particular inspiration\nfrom Anscombe. (See Audi 1973; Harman 1976; Davis 1984; Ross 2009.) As\nGrice (1971, pp. 264\u20136) observed, there is peculiarity of some\nsort in asserting \u2018I intend to do A, but I might not do\nit,\u2019 a peculiarity readily explained if intention is a species\nof belief. It is equally striking that the ordinary expression of\nintention for the future is \u2018I am going to do A\u2019 (Anscombe\n1963, p. 1), which looks like the assertoric expression of belief. The\nsame point holds for intention in action: \u2018What are you up\nto?\u2019; \u2018I am doing A.\u2019 Although such\nevidence is suggestive, however, it might be explained in other ways.\n(See Davidson 1978, pp. 91, 100; for criticism, Pears 1985; and for\nmore recent discussion, Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler 2018,\n\u00a72.2; Levy 2018; Asarnow forthcoming.)\n\nSo far, we have only the fragment of a theory, an alleged condition of\nintending, not an adequate account of what intention is. Here there\nare several possibilities. It is sometimes said that intention\nis belief (Velleman 1989; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler\n2018). But this creates a risk of confusion. It is not clear that\nanyone believes there is a value of p such that intending to\ndo A is no more than believing p. Instead they hold\nthat part of what it is to intend to do A is to believe\np; other conditions must be met. The confusion stems from\ntalk of particular \u2018tokens\u2019 of intending which may be\nidentified with tokens of belief. But the idea of a token state may\nnot be coherent (Steward 1997) and the would-be cognitivist need think\notherwise.\n\nIf intention involves belief, what more does it require? On the\nsimplest proposal, to intend an action is to believe that one will\nperform it and to have an appropriate guiding desire (Audi 1973, p.\n395). But a mere conjunction seems insufficient: the desire and belief\ncould be utterly unrelated (Davis 1984, pp. 141\u20132). This prompts\nthe suggestion that, when S intends to do A, his\nbelief rests on his desire: to intend an action is to believe that one\nwill perform it on the ground that one wants to do so (Davis 1984, p.\n147; see also Grice 1971, pp. 278\u20139). The principal defect of\nthis account is that it makes the belief component of intention\nepiphenomenal. This belief merely registers one\u2019s activity: the\nmotivational work is done by a prior desire. (Something similar is\ntrue on more subtle theories that divorce the motivational role of\nintention from belief; as, for instance, Ross 2009, pp. 250\u20131.)\nIf the claim that intention involves belief is to capture the essence\nof the will, not a superficial fact about the word\n\u2018intend,\u2019 the belief must be implicated in the functions\nof intending and the explanation of action. (For objections of this\nkind, see Bratman 1987, pp. 19\u201320 and Mele 1992, Ch. 8 on\n\u2018intention*\u2019; on the role of beliefs in planning for the\nfuture, see Velleman 1989, Ch. 8; Velleman 2007; Maru\u0161i\u0107\nand Schwenkler 2018, \u00a72.3; Alonso 2020; Alonso 2021.)\n\nThere is variation even among those accounts that give a motivational\nrole to belief. On Velleman\u2019s early view, intentions are\n\u2018self-fulfilling expectations that are motivated by a desire for\ntheir fulfillment and that represent themselves as such\u2019\n(Velleman 1989, p. 109). Such expectations interact with a general\ndesire for self-knowledge to motivate action by which they are\nconfirmed. More recently, Velleman has replaced the desire for\nself-knowledge with a sub-personal aim or disposition (Velleman 2000:\n19\u201321). Either way, his view threatens to generate what Bratman\n(1991, pp. 261\u20132) calls \u2018the problem of\npromiscuity\u2019: in attributing a general tendency that motivates\nus to conform to our own expectations, it predicts that we will be\njust as strongly motivated by beliefs that do not constitute\nintentions, like the belief that I am going to trip over the step, or\nmispronounce a word.\n\nA different proposal, due to Harman (1976, p. 168) is that intentions\nare \u2018conclusion[s] of practical reasoning\u2019 (see also Ross\n2009, pp. 270\u20132; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and Schwenkler 2018). But\nit seems possible to intend an action spontaneously, for no particular\nreason. In later work, Harman looks downstream of intention, rather\nthan upstream: an intention is a belief about what one is doing or\nwhat one is going to do that has the power to guide and motivate\naction through practical thought (Harman 1986, pp. 375\u20136; Setiya\n2007a, pp. 48\u201353). This claim interacts with the question about\n\u2018disjunctive\u2019 theories left unanswered at the end of\nsection 2. If intention involves belief, those who treat knowledge as\nbasic, with mere belief its defective form, will take a similar view\nof \u2018knowledge in intention\u2019 (R\u00f6dl 2007; Ch. 2;\nMcDowell 2010, \u00a77; Marcus 2012, Ch. 2). In the good case,\none\u2019s intention in action involves knowledge of what one is\ndoing: it entails, so cannot cause or motivate, one\u2019s action. In\nthe bad case, one merely intends to act. If not its causal role,\nhowever, what distinguishes knowledge in intention from knowledge of\nother kinds?\n\nFinally, there is Anscombe\u2019s own view, on which there is a\nnormative contrast between intention and ordinary belief. If one fails\nto act as one intends, and not through a mistaken belief about the\nmeans or possibilities for action, \u2018the mistake is not one of\njudgment but of performance\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, pp. 56\u20137).\nIntention sets a standard of success for what does. (For discussions\nof this point, see Frost 2014; Setiya 2016a; Campbell 2018a; Campbell\n2018b.) What is more, there is \u2018a difference of form between\nreasoning leading to action and reasoning for the truth of a\nconclusion\u2019 (Anscombe 1963, p. 60). Intention is justified by\nthe former, not the latter: by practical not theoretical reasoning\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 57\u201362).\n\nIn this respect, Anscombe\u2019s doctrine differs most sharply from\nVelleman\u2019s. As well as thinking of intention as a kind of\nbelief, Velleman holds that \u2018practical reasoning is a kind of\ntheoretical reasoning\u2019 (Velleman 1989, p. 15; see also Ross\n2009). In a review of Velleman\u2019s book, Bratman (1991, pp.\n250\u20131) dubbed the conjunction of these claims \u2018cognitivism\nabout practical reason.\u2019 It prompts what Davidson (1978, p. 95)\ncalled \u2018the strongest argument against identifying [intention]\nwith [belief],\u2019 that \u2018reasons for intending to do\nsomething are in general quite different from reasons for believing\none will do it.\u2019 Though Velleman (1989, pp. 122\u20135) defends\nthat identification, one need not do so in order to accept the theory\nof intention as a form of belief or the idea of \u2018knowledge in\nintention.\u2019\n\nA more modest \u2018cognitivism\u2019 would hold that intention\ninvolves belief, that practical reasoning does not reduce to\ntheoretical, but that some requirements that govern intention are best\nunderstood as requirements of theoretical reason. It is often regarded\nas a virtue of such cognitivism that it explains why there should be\nan indefeasible requirement of consistency among intentions and\nbeliefs (Ross 2009, pp. 244\u20137). It has also been argued that the\nrequirement of means-end coherence follows from requirements of\ntheoretical reason on the beliefs that figure in our intentions\n(Harman 1976, p. 153; Wallace 2001; Setiya 2007b; Ross 2009, pp.\n261\u20135). If I intend to do E and thus believe that I\nwill do it, and I believe that doing M is a necessary means\nto doing E, but do not intend or believe that I am going to\ndo M, I fail to believe a practically salient logical\nconsequence of what I believe. The principal challenge for a\ncognitivist account of means-end coherence is to explain why one must\navoid such theoretical failures by forming the relevant intention, not\njust the corresponding belief (Bratman 2009a). But once again, one\nneed not defend cognitivism, even in its less ambitious form, in\nconceiving intention as a kind of belief.\n\nThere are two main arguments against this conception. The first turns\non apparent cases of intention without belief. According to Davidson,\n\u2018[a] man may be making ten carbon copies as he writes, and this\nmay be intentional; yet he may not know that he is; all he knows is\nthat he is trying\u2019 (Davidson 1971, p. 50; see also Davidson\n1978, pp. 91\u20134). Or imagine I am recovering from paralysis, and\nmovement slowly returns to my hand. At a certain point, I am not sure\nthat I can clench my fist. As it happens, I can. But if I try to do so\nbehind my back, under anesthesia, I may not believe that I am\nclenching my fist, even though\u2014on the face of it\u2014I am\ndoing so intentionally, and that is just what I intend (Setiya 2008,\npp. 390\u20131). Something similar crops up in planning for the\nfuture. I intend to mail the bills on the way to work, but I know that\nI am forgetful, and don\u2019t believe that I will do it (see Bratman\n1987, pp. 37\u20138).\n\nSuch examples can be dealt with in various ways. One strategy insists\nthat, when I do not believe that I am clenching my fist, or that I\nwill mail the bills, I do not intend the corresponding actions, I\nmerely intend to try (Harman 1986, pp. 364\u20135; Velleman\n1989, pp. 115\u20136). But do I really act as I intended if I try and\nfail? (See Pears 1985, p. 86; McCann 1991, p. 212.) And when I know\nthat I am forgetful, do I even believe that I will try to mail the\nbills? A more radical theory points to the simplifying assumption,\noften made in epistemology, that belief is binary and does not come by\ndegree. On that assumption, it may be harmless to claim that intention\ninvolves belief. But the truth is bound to be more complex: that in\nforming an intention one becomes more confident than one would\notherwise be (Setiya 2008, pp. 391\u20132); or that the will is a\ncapacity to know what one is doing, or what one is going to do, whose\nexercise may be impeded, yielding mere belief or partial belief\ninstead of knowledge (Pears 1985, pp. 78\u201381; Setiya 2009, pp.\n129\u201331; Setiya 2012, pp. 300\u2013303; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and\nSchwenkler 2018, \u00a73.1).\n\nA final response casts doubt on the examples. When we recall the\n\u2018openness\u2019 of the progressive, we can insist that\nDavidson\u2019s carbon-copier knows that he is making ten copies,\neven if he is not sure the copies are going through first time (see\nThompson 2011; Wolfson 2012). It is not a condition of being embarked\non intentional action that one will in fact succeed. The same might be\nsaid when I am clenching my first, if what I know is merely that I am\nin progress towards doing so, in some liminal way. (This points back\nto the theory of intending as doing, discussed in section 1.) This\nstrategy struggles with prospective intention and the belief that I am\ngoing to act. But its advocates may insist that the content of\nprospective intention is also imperfective (Thompson 2008, pp.\n142\u20135). We have practical knowledge only of what is in progress,\nnot what has happened, or what will.\n\nThe second objection is epistemic. If forming an intention is, among\nother things, coming to believe that one is doing A, or that\none is going to do A, what entitles us to form such beliefs?\nNot, or not ordinarily, that we have sufficient evidence of their\ntruth. Forming an intention is not predicting the future on the basis\nof what one takes to be, or what ought to be, adequate grounds. That\nis why Anscombe calls practical knowledge \u2018knowledge without\nobservation,\u2019 meaning to exclude not only observation in the\nnarrow sense but knowledge by inference (Anscombe 1963, p. 50). And it\nis why Velleman (1989) writes about \u2018spontaneous\u2019\nknowledge of action. Even though he hopes to reduce practical to\ntheoretical reasoning, and holds that intention involves belief, he\ndenies that intentions are formed on the basis of sufficient prior\nevidence. Anscombe and Velleman concede that knowledge in intention\noften rests in part on observation; the claim is that it goes beyond\nwhat observation, or inference from prior evidence, can support. (For\ndiffering views of the role of perception in practical knowledge, see\nPickard 2004; Gibbons 2010; Schwenkler 2011; Ford 2016.)\n\nThe postulation of beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence is\nsometimes taken as a fatal flaw. In a memorable formulation, Grice\n(1971, p. 268) wrote that it makes decision \u2018a case of licensed\nwishful thinking.\u2019 According to Grice, we are not epistemically\npermitted to form beliefs about what we are doing, or what we are\ngoing to do, without sufficient prior evidence. Instead, we know what\nwe are doing, or what we are going to do, by inference from the\ncondition of our will, along with premises about our own abilities\n(Grice 1971, pp. 275\u20139; Paul 2009). The condition of the will\ncannot itself involve belief.\n\nReactions to this problem vary widely. Those who restrict the content\nof intention to what is in progress and emphasize how little is\ninvolved in being embarked on intentional action may suggest that the\nbeliefs in question verify themselves. It is sufficient for doing\nA intentionally, in the relevant sense, that one intends to\ndo it. As we saw in section 1, however, there are reasons to doubt\nthis sufficiency. And the view seems to deflate the interest of\npractical knowledge. Anscombe warns against the \u2018false avenue of\nescape\u2019 on which \u2018I really \u201cdo\u201d in the\nintentional sense whatever I think I am doing\u2019 (Anscombe 1963,\np. 52), and seems to allow for practical knowledge of what I will\nactually do or what I have done (Moran 2004: 146; Setiya 2016a; Haase\n2018).\n\nOther views account for knowledge in intention in reliabilist terms:\nwhere one\u2019s intention to do A reliably issues in doing\nA, it may amount to knowledge of what one is doing, or what\none is going to do (Newstead 2006, \u00a72; Velleman 2007, \u00a75).\nNon-reliabilists may dismiss the need for prior evidence,\nholding that we are entitled to form a belief if we know that it will\nbe true, and that we will have sufficient evidence for its truth, once\nformed; this condition can be met when we form an intention to act\n(Harman 1976, p. 164, n. 8; Velleman 1989, pp. 56\u201364). So long\nas I know what I intend, and that my intention will be effective, I\nhave sufficient evidence for what I am doing, or what am I going to\ndo, even though this evidence did not precede the forming of my\nintention.\n\nCritics may object to the necessity of these conditions. According to\nBerislav Maru\u0161i\u0107 (2015), I can form the \u2018practical\nbelief\u2019 that I will do A without knowing that my\nintention will be effective, so long as I know that its execution is\nup to me. A more common objection is that the conditions are not\nsufficient. They assimilate intention to faith, as when I form the\nbelief that I can leap a great chasm even though I have no evidence of\nmy ability to do so, knowing that the belief itself will ensure\nsuccess. It is not clear that such acts of faith are possible, that\nthey are epistemically rational, or that they provide a plausible\nmodel for intention (Langton 2004; Setiya 2008, \u00a7III). On an\nalternative view, there is a general demand for prior evidence in\nforming beliefs, but our intentions are sometimes exempt from it, as\nperhaps when we know how to perform the relevant acts (Setiya 2008;\nSetiya 2009; Setiya 2012). It is know-how that explains why the\nexecution of our intentions, and thus the truth of the beliefs that\nthey involve, can be credited to us.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s position on the matter is elusive, and may have to do\nwith her normative claims about intention and belief. Is practical\nknowledge exempt from ordinary requirements of evidence because there\nis a mistake of performance, not of judgement, when its object is\nfalse? (See Anscombe 1963, pp. 4\u20135, 56\u20137; Campbell 2018a.)\nWould it then amount to knowledge of what is not the case? Anscombe\nmay seem to suggest as much (Anscombe 1963, p. 82), but it is unclear\nwhether she accepts or merely entertains this prospect.\n\nImplicit these debates is a question about the scope of groundless\n(non-perceptual, non-inferential) self-knowledge. A blanket objection\nto beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence cannot be\nsustained: I often know what I believe without having come to know on\nthe basis of perception or inference. Is groundless knowledge of this\nkind restricted to our mental states? Or can it extend to what we are\ndoing and what we are going to do? Compare externalism about content:\nat least typically, believing p has implications for the\nconstitution of the world outside one\u2019s skin; but it remains\naccessible to self-knowledge (Burge 1988). Why should that not be true\nof intentional action? On any reading, part of the aim of\nAnscombe\u2019s Intention was to break the Cartesian\nprejudice against self-knowledge of what is happening in the world. If\nshe failed in that endeavour, she at least prescribed a task for\nfuture work: to say whether it is indeed a prejudice or a decisive\nobstacle to the possibility of practical knowledge and the theory that\nintention involves belief.\n",
