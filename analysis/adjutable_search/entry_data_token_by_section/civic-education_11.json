    "main_text": "The Good Person\n3. The Good Person\n\nThe qualities of the good citizen are not simply the skills necessary\nto participate in the political system. They are also the virtues that\nwill lead one to participate, to want to participate, to have a\ndisposition to participate. This is what Rousseau was referring to\nwhen he described how citizens in his ideal polity would \u201cfly to\nthe assemblies\u201d (1988, 140). Citizens, that is, ought to display\na certain kind of disposition or character. As it turns out, and not\nsurprisingly, given our perspective, in a democracy the virtues or\ntraits that constitute good citizenship are also closely associated\nwith being a good or moral person. We can summarize that close\nassociation as what we mean by the phrase \u201cgood\ncharacter.\u201d\n\nIt is the absence of these virtues or traits\u2014that is, the\nabsence of character\u2014that leads some to conclude that democracy,\nespecially in the United States, is in crisis. The withering of our\ndemocratic system, argues Richard Battistoni, for one, can be traced\nto \u201ca crisis in civic education\u201d and the failure of our\neducators to prepare citizens for democratic participation (1985, pp.\n4\u20135). Missing, he argues, is a central character trait, a\ndisposition to participate. Crucial to the continuation of our\ndemocracy \u201cis the proper inculcation in the young of the\ncharacter, skills, values, social practices, and ideals that foster\ndemocratic politics\u201d (Ibid, p. 15); in other words, educating\nfor democratic character.\n",
