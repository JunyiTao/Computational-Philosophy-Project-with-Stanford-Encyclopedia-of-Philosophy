    "main_text": "\n\nHow are synthetic a priori propositions possible? This\nquestion is often times understood to frame the investigations at\nissue in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. In answer to\nit, Kant saw fit to divide the question into three: 1) How are the\nsynthetic a priori propositions of mathematics possible? 2)\nHow are the synthetic a priori propositions of natural\nscience possible? Finally, 3) How are the synthetic a priori\npropositions of metaphysics possible? In systematic fashion, Kant\nresponds to each of these questions. The answer to question one is\nbroadly found in the Transcendental Aesthetic, and the doctrine of the\ntranscendental ideality of space and time. The answer to question two\nis found in the Transcendental Analytic, where Kant seeks to\ndemonstrate the essential role played by the categories in grounding\nthe possibility of knowledge and experience. The answer to question\nthree is found in the Transcendental Dialectic, and it is a\nresoundingly blunt conclusion: the synthetic a priori\npropositions that characterize metaphysics are not really possible at\nall. Metaphysics, that is, is inherently dialectical. Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Pure Reason is thus as well known for what it\nrejects as for what it defends. Thus, in the Dialectic, Kant turns his\nattention to the central disciplines of traditional, rationalist,\nmetaphysics \u2014 rational psychology, rational cosmology, and\nrational theology. Kant aims to reveal the errors that plague each of\nthese fields.\n",
