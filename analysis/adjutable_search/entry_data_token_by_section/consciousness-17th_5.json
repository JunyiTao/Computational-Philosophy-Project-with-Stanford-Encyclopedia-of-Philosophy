    "main_text": "Spinoza || Ideae Idearum\n3.2 Ideae Idearum\n\nAt the beginning of the previous section, we noted that Spinoza rarely\nuses the term conscientia, and when he does it is primarily\nin parts 3 through 5. This claim, while true, is somewhat misleading.\nNote that the quotation above from 3p9 refers us back to 2p23 for his\nclaims about consciousness. And again in 3p30d, 3def.aff1, and 4p8d\nSpinoza refers us back to 2p23, 19, or 21. It seems clear that he\nintends 2p19 through 23 to have some consequence for his theory of\nconsciousness, and so many commentators have tried to develop an\naccount of consciousness from what Spinoza says in that section of the\nEthics.\n\n2p23 does not say anything about consciousness as such. Instead, it\ndescribes the way the mind knows itself and the limits on the\nmind\u2019s knowledge of itself. Here is what Spinoza says:\n\n\nP23: The Mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives\nthe ideas of the affections of the Body.\n\nDem.: The idea, or knowledge of the mind (by P20) follows in\nGod in the same way, and is related to God in the same way as the\nidea, or knowledge, of the body. But since (by P19) the human\nMind does not know the human Body itself, i.e. (by P11C), since the\nknowledge of the human Body is not related to God insofar as he\nconstitutes the nature of the human Mind, the knowledge of the Mind is\nalso not related to God insofar as he constitutes the essence of the\nhuman Mind. And so (again by P11C) to that extent the human Mind does\nnot know itself.\n\nNext, the ideas of the affections by which the Body is affected\ninvolve the nature of the human Body itself (by P16), i.e. (by P13),\nagree with the nature of the Mind. So knowledge of these ideas will\nnecessarily involve knowledge of the Mind. But (by P22) knowledge of\nthese ideas is in the Mind itself. Therefore, the human Mind, to that\nextent only, knows itself, q.e.d.\n\n\nMany of the crucial phrases are ambiguous here, but as a first\nattempt, we might say that Spinoza is arguing for the following\nthesis:\n\n\nA mind has a conscious thought of P iff\n\nthe mind has an idea that represents its body being affected by\nP; and\nthe mind has a second idea representing the first to itself.\n\n\n\nThis is one way to make sense of \u201cperceiv[ing] the ideas of the\naffections of the Body.\u201d Edwin Curley presents such an\ninterpretation of this passage (Curley 1969, 128). The benefit of this\ntheory of consciousness is that it is thoroughly representational, and\nso it is consistent with Spinoza\u2019s general project of developing\na representational theory of mind. Further, this theory would seem to\nentail that not all minds are conscious (or that not all thoughts are\nconscious)\u2014Spinoza suggests that infants are not conscious in\n5p6s and 5p35s\n\nDespite these advantages, this initial understanding of this passage\nhas fallen under heavy fire. Margaret Wilson has objected to this\nreading by arguing that it does not provide a satisfactory way of\ndistinguishing between conscious and non-conscious minds or conscious\nand non-conscious thoughts. Since, in God, there must be ideas of all\nideas, any given idea (and any given mind) will have the necessary\nsecond idea (or even infinitely many\u2014see 2p21s) that would\nrender it conscious. (See Wilson, 134\u2013138 for further\nobjections.) Jonathan Bennett puts forward similar objections,\nconcluding that if this is Spinoza\u2019s account of consciousness,\nit is \u201cabsurdly excessive\u201d (Bennett 188). Curley concedes\nthe point (see Curley 1988, 71\u201372).\n\nOthers have tried to rehabilitate this interpretation and respond to\nthe potential objections. Lee C. Rice (1990) and Christopher Martin\n(2007) both offer responses to the objections and attempt to defend\nthis interpretation of Spinoza\u2019s theory of consciousness. Their\nefforts at making sense of 2p19\u201323 are interesting, but it is\nnot easy from this section of the text to avoid the \u201cabsurdly\nexcessive\u201d conclusions. Of course, one could simply bite the\nbullet here and say that Spinoza is in fact \u201cabsurdly\nexcessive\u201d! He is committed to panpsychism, why not take the\nshort step to a similarly extensive account of consciousness? Indeed,\nthe next set of interpretations are prepared to go that far. \n",
