    "main_text": "Third Case Study: The Regress Problem || Coherentism\n3.1 Coherentism\n\nThe immediate concern about coherentism is that it makes justification\ncircular. How can a belief be justified by other beliefs which are,\nultimately, justified by the first belief in question? If cycles of\njustification are allowed, what\u2019s to stop one from believing\nanything one likes, and appealing to it as a justification for\nitself?\n\nCoherentists usually respond that justification doesn\u2019t actually\ngo in cycles. In fact, it isn\u2019t even really a relationship\nbetween individual beliefs. Rather, a belief is justified by being\npart of a larger body of beliefs that fit together well, that\ncohere. Justification is thus global, or\nholistic. It is a feature of an entire body of beliefs first,\nand only of individual beliefs second, in virtue of their being part\nof the coherent whole. When we trace the justification for a belief\nback and back and back until we come full circle, we aren\u2019t\nexposing the path by which it\u2019s justified. Rather, we are\nexposing the various interconnections that make the whole web\njustified as a unit. That these connections can be traced in a circle\nmerely exposes how interconnected the web is, being connected in both\ndirections, from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) to \u2026to \\(N\\), and then from\n\\(N\\) all the way back to \\(A\\) again.\n\nStill, arbitrariness remains a worry: you can still believe just about\nanything, provided you also believe many other things that fit well\nwith it. If I want to believe in ghosts, can I just adopt a larger\nworld view on which supernatural and paranormal phenomena are rife?\nThis worry leads to a further one, a worry about truth: given that\nalmost any belief can be embedded in a larger, just-so story that\nmakes sense of it, why expect a coherent body of beliefs to be true?\nThere are many coherent stories one can tell, the vast majority of\nwhich will be massively false. If coherence is no indication of truth,\nhow can it provide justification?\n\nThis is where formal methods come in: what does probability theory\ntell us about the connection between coherence and truth? Are more\ncoherent bodies of belief more likely to be true? Less likely?\n\nKlein and Warfield (1994) argue that coherence often\ndecreases probability. Why? Increases in coherence often come\nfrom new beliefs that make sense of our existing beliefs. A detective\ninvestigating a crime may be puzzled by conflicting testimony until\nshe learns that the suspect has an identical twin, which explains why\nsome witnesses report seeing the suspect in another city the day of\nthe crime. And yet, adding the fact about the identical twin to her\nbody of beliefs actually decreases its probability. This follows from\na theorem of the probability axioms we noted earlier\n (\u00a71.2),\n Conjunction Costs Probability, which says that conjoining \\(A\\) with\n\\(B\\) generally yields a lower probability than for \\(A\\) alone\n(unless \\(p(A \\wedge \\neg B)=0\\)). Intuitively, the more things you\nbelieve the more risks you take with the truth. But making sense of\nthings often requires believing more.\n\nMerricks (1995) replies that it\u2019s only the probability of the\nentire belief corpus that goes down when beliefs are added. But the\nindividual probabilities of the beliefs it contains are what\u2019s\nat issue. And from the detective\u2019s point of view, her individual\nbeliefs do become more probable when made sense of by the additional\ninformation that the suspect has an identical twin. Shogenji (1999)\ndiffers: coherence of the whole cannot influence probability of the\nparts. Coherence is for the parts to stand or fall together, so just\nas coherence makes all the members more likely to be true together, it\nmakes it more likely that they are all false (at the expense of the\npossibility that some will turn out true and others false).\n\nInstead, Shogenji prefers to answer Klein & Warfield at the\ncollective level, the level of the whole belief corpus. He argues that\nthe corpora Klein & Warfield compare differ in probability because\nthey are of different strengths. The more beliefs a corpus\ncontains, or the more specific its beliefs are, the stronger it is. In\nthe case of the detective, adding the information about the twin\nincreases the strength of her beliefs. And, in general, increasing\nstrength decreases probability, since as we\u2019ve seen, \\(p(A\n\\wedge B) \\leq p(A)\\). Thus the increase in the coherence of the\ndetective\u2019s beliefs is accompanied by an increase in strength.\nThe net effect, argues Shogenji, is negative: the probability of the\ncorpus goes down because the increase in strength outweighs the\nincrease in coherence.\n\nTo vindicate this diagnosis, Shogenji appeals to a formula for\nmeasuring the coherence of a belief-set in probabilistic terms, which\nwe\u2019ll label coh:\n\\[ \\textit{coh}(A_1,\\ldots,A_n) = \\frac{p(A_1\n\\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n)}{p(A_1) \\times \\ldots \\times\np(A_n)}\\]\n\nTo see the rationale behind this formula, consider the simple case of\njust two beliefs:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\textit{coh}(A,B) &=\n\\frac{p(A \\wedge B)}{p(A) \\times p(B)}\\\\ &= \\frac{p(A \\mid\nB)}{p(A)}\\end{align}\\]\n\nWhen \\(B\\) has no bearing on \\(A\\), \\(p(A\\mid B)=p(A)\\), and this\nratio just comes out 1, which is our neutral point. If instead \\(B\\)\nraises the probability of \\(A\\), this ratio comes out larger than 1;\nand if \\(B\\) lowers the probability of \\(A\\), it comes out smaller\nthan 1. So \\(\\textit{coh}(A,B)\\) measures the extent to which \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are related. Shogenji\u2019s formula\n\\(\\textit{coh}(A_1,\\ldots,A_n)\\) generalizes this idea for larger\ncollections of propositions.\n\nHow does measuring coherence this way vindicate Shogenji\u2019s reply\nto Klein & Warfield, that the increase in the detective\u2019s\ncoherence is outweighed by an increase in the strength of her beliefs?\nThe denominator in the formula for \\(\\textit{coh}\\) tracks strength:\nthe more propositions there are, and the more specific they are, the\nsmaller this denominator will be. So if we compare two belief-sets\nwith the same strength, their denominators will be the same. Thus, if\none is more coherent than the other, it must be because its numerator\nis greater. Thus coherence increases with overall probability,\nprovided strength is held constant. Since in the detective\u2019s\ncase overall probability does not increase despite the increase in\ncoherence, it must be because the strength of her commitments had an\neven stronger influence.\n\nShogenji\u2019s measure of coherence is criticized by other authors,\nmany of whom offer their own, preferred measures (Akiba 2000; Olsson\n2002, 2005; Glass 2002; Bovens & Hartmann 2003; Fitelson 2003;\nDouven and Meijs 2007). Which measure is correct, if any, remains\ncontroversial, as does the fate of Klein & Warfield\u2019s\nargument against coherentism. Another line of probabilistic attack on\ncoherentism, which we won\u2019t explore here, comes from Huemer\n(1997) and is endorsed by Olsson (2005). Huemer (2011) later retracts\nthe argument though, on the grounds that it foists unnecessary\ncommitments on the coherentist. More details are available in\n the entry on coherentism.\n",
