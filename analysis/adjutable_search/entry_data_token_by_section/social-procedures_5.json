The Stable Marriage Problem\n\nSuppose equal sets of men and women are given, all of them seeking to\nmarry someone of the opposite gender, and each man has listed his\npreferences for the women by means of a strict ordering, and similarly\nfor each woman. A stable marriage match is a\none-to-one mapping between the men and women with the property that if\na man prefers another woman over his own wife, then that woman does\nnot prefer him to her own husband, and if a\nwoman prefers another man over her own husband, then that man does\nnot prefer her to his own wife.\n",
