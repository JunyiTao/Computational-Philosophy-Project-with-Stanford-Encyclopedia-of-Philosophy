    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || Multi-criterial approaches\n4.6 Multi-criterial approaches\n\nPopper\u2019s method of demarcation consists essentially of the\nsingle criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted\nto combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually\nperformed and their outcomes respected, see Section 4.2). Most of the\nother criteria discussed above are similarly mono-criterial, of course\nwith Merton\u2019s proposal as a major exception.\n\nMost authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put\nforward a list of such criteria. A large number of lists have been\npublished that consist of (usually 5\u201310) criteria that can be\nused in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific\npractice. This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989), Gruenberger\n(1964), Dutch (1982), Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner (1982), Kitcher\n(1982, 30\u201354), Grove (1985), Thagard (1988, 157\u2013173),\nGlymour and Stalker (1990), Derksen (1993, 2001), Vollmer (1993), Ruse\n(1996, 300\u2013306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria that\nappear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in\nSections 4.2 and 4.4. One such list reads as follows:\n\nBelief in authority: It is contended that some person or\npersons have a special ability to determine what is true or false.\nOthers have to accept their judgments.\nUnrepeatable experiments: Reliance is put on experiments\nthat cannot be repeated by others with the same outcome.\nHandpicked examples: Handpicked examples are used\nalthough they are not representative of the general category that the\ninvestigation refers to.\nUnwillingness to test: A theory is not tested although it\nis possible to test it.\nDisregard of refuting information: Observations or\nexperiments that conflict with a theory are neglected.\nBuilt-in subterfuge: The testing of a theory is so\narranged that the theory can only be confirmed, never disconfirmed, by\nthe outcome.\nExplanations are abandoned without replacement. Tenable\nexplanations are given up without being replaced, so that the new\ntheory leaves much more unexplained than the previous one. \n\n\nSome of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations have\ndefended this approach as being superior to any mono-criterial\ndemarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982, 372) asserted that many philosophers\nhave failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they\nhave presupposed that a single attribute will do; in his view the\ncombination of several criteria is needed. Dupr\u00e9 (1993, 242)\nproposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family\nresemblance concept. This would mean that there is a set of features\nthat are characteristic of science, but although every part of science\nwill have some of these features, we should not expect any part of\nscience to have all of them. Irzik and Nola (2011) proposed the use of\nthis approach in science education.\n\nHowever, a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to\njustify a multicriterial account of how pseudoscience deviates from\nscience. Even if science can be characterized by a single defining\ncharacteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate from\nscience in widely divergent ways.\n",
