    "main_text": "Applications || Haecceitism\n5.3 Haecceitism\n\nHaecceitism is the view that identity properties, like being Kofi\nAnnan or being that particular table, do not supervene\non qualitative properties. On this view, every two numerically\ndistinct things differ haecceitistically, but no other difference\nfollows. Questions about whether there could be qualitatively\nindiscernible but numerically distinct things becomes important in\nmodal metaphysics.\n\nThe issue here is an instance of something more general. Supervenience\nplays a useful role in answering questions about the identity and\nindividuation conditions for things belonging to some kind. As\nDavidson pointed out, there is a prima facie puzzle (1980,\nch. 5) about how to address such questions. The answer to the question\n\u201cWhen are two events identical?\u201d is\ntrivial\u2014\u201cNever.\u201d And the answer to the question\n\u201cWhen is an event identical with itself?\u201d is likewise\ntrivial\u2014\u201cAlways.\u201d But surely there is a substantive\nquestion lurking here. Davidson himself opted to get around this worry\nby means of semantic ascent. But an alternative is to move to what\nDavid Lewis calls \u2018a nonduplication principle\u2019 (see J.\nBennett 1988). Instead of asking when two events are identical, we can\nask a fill in the blank question: \u2018no two events can be just\nalike with respect to ______\u2019? Davidson would fill in the blank\nwith \u2018their causes and effects\u2019. Kim would fill in the\nblank with \u2018their subject, time, and constitutive\nproperty\u2019 (1976); others fill in the blank in other ways.\n\nWhat matters here is just that nonduplication principles are\nsupervenience theses. They are supervenience theses that take the\nsupervening set A to be the identity facts for particular\nentities of whatever kind is in question. There cannot be a difference\nin whether an event has a property like being event e without\na difference in its causes and effects (Davidson) or in its subject,\nconstitutive property, and time (Kim). Note that any view that accepts\na nonduplication principle for some sort of entity is ipso\nfacto anti-haecceitist. Both Davidson and Kim are\nanti-haecceitists about events.\n",
