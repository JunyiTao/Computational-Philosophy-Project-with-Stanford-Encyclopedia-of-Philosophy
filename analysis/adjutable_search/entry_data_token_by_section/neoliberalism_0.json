Is neoliberalism an ideology that fetishizes the\nmarket? Or is it a political program aimed at establishing the rule of\nthe capitalist class? Is neoliberalism the enemy of the state? Or does\nit favor the state to sustain the conditions for competitive markets?\nRajesh Venugopal (2015: 166) has argued that neoliberalism\n\n\nis now widely acknowledged in the literature as a controversial,\nincoherent, and crisis-ridden term, even by many of its most\ninfluential deployers,\n\n\nsuch as Michel Foucault (2004 [2010]). Venugopal\u2019s assessment\nwas arguably apt just ten years ago.\n\nBut several recent book-length treatments of neoliberalism (Burgin\n2012; Biebricher 2018; Slobodian 2018; Whyte 2019) have helped give\nform to an arguably inchoate political concept. As Quinn Slobodian\nargues,\n\n\nin the last decade, extraordinary efforts have been made to\nhistoricize neoliberalism and its prescriptions for global governance,\nand to transform the \u201cpolitical swearword\u201d or\n\u201canti-liberal slogan\u201d into a subject of rigorous archival\nresearch. (2018: 3)\n\n\nAlong similar lines, Thomas Biebricher (2018: 8\u20139) argues that\nneoliberalism no longer faces greater analytic hurdles than other\npolitical positions like conservatism or socialism.\n\nIn light of this recent historical work, we are now in a position to\nunderstand neoliberalism as a distinctive political theory.\nNeoliberalism holds that a society\u2019s political and economic\ninstitutions should be robustly liberal and capitalist, but\nsupplemented by a constitutionally limited democracy and a modest\nwelfare state. Neoliberals endorse liberal rights and the free-market\neconomy to protect freedom and promote economic prosperity.\nNeoliberals are broadly democratic, but stress the limitations of\ndemocracy as much as its necessity. And while neoliberals typically\nthink government should provide social insurance and public goods,\nthey are skeptical of the regulatory state, extensive government\nspending, and government-led countercyclical policy. Thus,\nneoliberalism is no mere economic doctrine. According to Biebricher,\nneoliberalism\n\n\nexplicitly addresses the noneconomic preconditions of functioning\nmarkets and the interactive effects between markets and their\nsurroundings. (2018: 27)\n\n\nAnd neoliberals share\n\n\nthe problem of how to identify the factors indispensable to the\nmaintenance of functioning markets. (2018: 26)\n\n\nSlobodian argues that all neoliberals\n\n\nsaw the intellectual project as finding the right state and the right\nlaw to serve the market order. (2018: 87)\n\n\nNeoliberals thereby offer unique institutional prescriptions on\ndistinctive grounds. Importantly, then, neoliberalism as a\nphilosophical doctrine is not an attempt to suffuse institutions with\nthe idea of human agents as homo economicus, (Brown 2019).\nInstead, following Jessica Whyte (2019: 8), neoliberalism has a\nnormative dimension that goes beyond the economic, since neoliberals\nbelieved\n\n\nthat a functioning competitive market required an adequate moral and\nlegal foundation,\n\n\nsuch that the arguments for neoliberal institutions involved an appeal\nto normative principles (2019: 14, 233).\n\nWe can helpfully explicate neoliberalism by examining the political\nconcepts, principles, and policies shared by three twentieth century\npolitical economists: F. A. Hayek, Milton Friedman, and James\nBuchanan. While they were trained as economists, all three wrote in\npolitical theory, and Hayek and Buchanan did so extensively.\nIdentifying the common themes in their work provides an accurate and\nilluminating picture of neoliberalism as a philosophical doctrine.\n\nThese figures were selected in response to the aforementioned\nhistorical research on neoliberalism. Biebricher (2018: 2) identifies\nall three figures as neoliberals, though he also counts Europe-focused\n\u201cordoliberals\u201d, specifically Walter Eucken, Wilhelm\nR\u00f6pke, and Alexander Rustow, as neoliberals. Slobodian (2018:\n268) identifies Friedman, Hayek, and Buchanan as neoliberals, though\nhe also includes the arguably libertarian Ludwig von\n Mises,[1]\n and a long litany of ordoliberals; he also focuses his analysis on\nwhat he calls \u201cGeneva school neoliberalism\u201d, where a great\ndeal of neoliberal thought about global institutions was\n focused.[2]\n Whyte (2019: 31) focuses more on Hayek and Friedman than Buchanan,\nbut she includes them in a larger cast of characters. So, while Hayek,\nFriedman, and Buchanan are not the only neoliberals, they are central\nto the new historical analysis. And by focusing on their thought, we\nnot only ease the burden of analysis, but provide space to focus on\nneoliberal ideas as crafted by their most reflective and insightful\nproponents. Further, other neoliberals said much less about their\nphilosophical commitments, so we have less material to work with.\nPerhaps the relative silence of other neoliberals makes it harder to\njustify using Hayek, Friedman, and Buchanan to represent them, but\ntheir shared political alliances and policies demonstrate substantial\n overlap.[3]\n\nThis entry\u2019s approach to defining neoliberalism differs from\nthat of Biebricher, Slobodian, Whyte, and Brown (Brown 2019) in much\nthe same way as political theorists and philosophers differ from\nhistorians, and indeed how philosophers differ from political\ntheorists. Neoliberalism can be understood as a somewhat static\ndoctrine to provide a basis for evaluation, and that can later serve\nto explicate variations on the view. It is perhaps more natural to\ntreat neoliberalism as a dynamic system of ideas, as historians do,\nand even some political theorists. Nonetheless, a review of Hayek,\nFriedman, and Buchanan reveals a sufficiently static doctrine to count\nas a kind of political philosophy.\n\nThe use of the term \u201cneoliberalism\u201d in this entry does not\nfit all uses of the term. Thus, the goal is less to explain what\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d really means in all its uses, but\nrather to proffer a meaning based on three criteria. First, the term\n\u201cneoliberalism\u201d should be used to denote a fairly coherent\nset of positions. Second, it should be used to capture the views of\nthose figures most often associated with the position. Finally, we\nshould focus on capturing the most serious and even-handed uses of the\nterm, such as by academic historians, rather than more popular and\npejorative uses of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d. This essay\u2019s\naccount of the meaning of the term satisfies all three criteria. It\nidentifies a coherent doctrine understood in light of the views of its\nproponents, and its use of the term overlaps with the more careful\nuses of the term by recent academic historians. We pursue all three\naims by locating common commitments in the thought of Hayek, Friedman,\nand Buchanan.\n",
