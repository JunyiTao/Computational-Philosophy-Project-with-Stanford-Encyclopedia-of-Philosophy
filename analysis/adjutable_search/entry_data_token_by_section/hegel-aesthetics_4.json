    "main_text": "Art and Idealization\n5. Art and Idealization\n\n\nArt, for Hegel, is essentially figurative. This is not because it\nseeks to imitate nature, but because its purpose is to express and\nembody free spirit and this is achieved most adequately\nthrough images of human beings. (We will consider the exceptions to\nthis\u2014architecture and music\u2014below.) More specifically,\nart\u2019s role is to bring to mind truths about ourselves and our\nfreedom that we often lose sight of in our everyday activity. Its role\nis to show us (or remind us of) the true character of freedom.\nArt fulfills this role by showing us the freedom of spirit in its\npurest form without the contingencies of everyday life. That\nis to say, art at its best presents us not with the all too familiar\ndependencies and drudgery of daily existence, but with the\nideal of freedom (see Aesthetics, 1: 155\u20136). This\nideal of human (and divine) freedom constitutes true beauty and is\nfound above all, Hegel claims, in ancient Greek sculptures of gods and\nheroes.\n\n\nNote that the work of idealization is undertaken not (like modern\nfashion photography) to provide an escape from life into a world of\nfantasy, but to enable us to see our freedom more\nclearly. Idealization is undertaken, therefore, in the interests of a\nclearer revelation of the true character of humanity (and of the\ndivine). The paradox is that art communicates truth\nthrough idealized images of human beings (and indeed\u2014in\npainting\u2014through the\nillusion of external reality).\n\n\nIt is worth noting at this stage that Hegel\u2019s account of art is\nmeant to be both descriptive and normative. Hegel thinks that the\naccount he gives describes the principal features of the greatest works\nof art in the Western tradition, such as the sculptures of Phidias or\nPraxiteles or the dramas of Aeschylus or Sophocles. At the same time,\nhis account is normative in so far as it tells us what true\nart is. There are many things that we call \u201cart\u201d: cave\npaintings, a child\u2019s drawing, Greek sculpture,\nShakespeare\u2019s plays, adolescent love poetry, and (in the\ntwentieth century) Carl Andr\u00e9\u2019s bricks. Not everything\ncalled \u201cart\u201d deserves the name, however, because not\neverything so called does what true art is meant to do:\nnamely, give sensuous expression to free spirit and thereby create\nworks of beauty. Hegel does not prescribe strict rules for the\nproduction of beauty; but he does set out broad criteria that\ntruly beautiful art must meet, and he is critical of work\nthat claims to be \u201cart\u201d but that fails to meet these\ncriteria.  Hegel\u2019s critique of certain developments in\npost-Reformation art\u2014such as the aspiration to do no more than\nimitate nature\u2014is thus based, not on contingent personal\npreferences, but on his philosophical understanding of the true nature\nand purpose of art.\n",
