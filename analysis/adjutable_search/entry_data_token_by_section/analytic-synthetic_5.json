If logical analysis could illuminate the\nfoundations of mathematics by showing how the axioms of arithmetic\ncould all be derived from pure logic by substitution of synonyms,\nperhaps it could also illuminate the foundations of the rest of our\nknowledge by showing how its claims could similarly be derived from\nsome kind of combination of logic and experience. Such was the hope\nand program of Logical Positivism (see Logical Empiricism)\nchampioned by, e.g., Moritz Schlick, A.J. Ayer and, especially, Rudolf\nCarnap from about 1915 in Vienna and Berlin to well into the 1950s in\nEngland and America. Of course, such a proposal did presume that all\nof our concepts were somehow \u201cderived\u201d either from logic\nor experience, but this seemed in keeping with the then prevailing\npresumptions of empiricism, which, they assumed, had been vindicated\nby the immense success of the empirical sciences.\n\nFor the Positivists, earlier empiricists, such as Locke, Berkeley and\nHume, had erred only in thinking that the mechanism of construction\nwas mere association. But association can\u2019t account for the\nstructure of even a simple judgment, such as Caesar is bald.\nThis is not merely the excitation of its constituent ideas,\nCaesar, is, and bald, along the lines of\nthe idea of salt exciting the idea of pepper, but,\nas Frege had shown, involves combining the noun Caesar and\nthe predicate is bald in a very particular way, a fact that\nwas important in accounting for more complex judgments such as\nCaesar is bald or not bald, or Someone is bald. Our\nthoughts and claims about the world have some kind of logical\nstructure, of a sort that seems to begin to be revealed by\nFrege\u2019s proposals. Equipped with his logic, it was possible to\nprovide a more plausible formulation of conceptual empiricism: our\nclaims about the empirical world were to be analyzed into the\n(dis)confirming experiences out of which they must somehow have been\nlogically constructed.\n\nBut constructed out of which experiences? For the\nPositivists, the answer seemed obvious: out of the experiential\ntests that would standardly justify, verify\nor confirm the claim. Indeed, as Ayer (1934, chap 1) made\nplain, a significant motivation for the Positivists was to save\nempirical knowledge from the predations of traditional sceptical\narguments about the possibility that all of life is a dream or the\ndeception of an evil demon: if meaning could be tied to verification,\nsuch possibilities could be rendered \u201cmeaningless\u201d because\nunverifiable (see Jerry Fodor, 2001, pp. 3\u20135, for a penetrating\ndiscussion of this motivation). In any event, interpreting\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1922) Tractatus claims about the nature\nof language epistemologically along the lines of the American\nphilosopher, C.S. Peirce, they proposed various versions of their\n\u201cVerifiability Theory of Meaning,\u201d according to which the\nmeaning (or what they called the \u201ccognitive significance\u201d)\nof any sentence was constituted by the conditions of its\nempirical\n (dis-)confirmation.[5]\n Thus, to say that the temperature of a liquid is of a certain\nmagnitude is to say, for example, that the mercury in a thermometer\nimmersed in the liquid would expand to a certain point marked by a\nnumeral representing that magnitude, a claim that would ordinarily be\ndisconfirmed if it didn\u2019t. Closer to \u201cexperience\u201d:\nto say that there is a cat on a mat is just to say that certain\npatterns of certain familiar visual, tactile and aural appearances are\nto be expected under certain circumstances.\n\nThe project of providing analyses in this way of especially\nproblematic concepts like those concerning, for example, material\nobjects, knowledge, perception, causation, expectation, freedom,\nand the self, was pursued by Positivists and other analytic\nphilosophers for a considerable period (see Carnap 1928 [1967] for\nsome rigorous examples, Ayer 1934 [1952] for more accessible ones).\nWith regard to material object claims, the program came to be known as\n\u201cphenomenalism\u201d; with regard to the theoretical claims of\nscience, as \u201coperationalism\u201d ; and with regard to the\nclaims about people\u2019s mental lives, \u201canalytical\nbehaviorism\u201d (the relevant experiential basis of mental claims\nbeing taken to be observations of others\u2019 behavior). Although\nthese programs became extremely influential, and some form of the\nverifiability criterion was often (and sometimes still is) invoked in\nphysics and psychology to constrain theoretical speculation, they\nseldom, if ever, met with any serious success. No sooner was an\nanalysis, say, of \u201cmaterial object\u201d or\n\u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cexpectation,\u201d proposed than\nserious counterexamples were raised and the analysis revised, only to\nbe faced with still further counterexamples (see Roderick Chisholm\n1957, and Fodor 1981, for discussion). Despite what seemed its initial\nplausibility, philosophers came to suspect that the criterion, and\nwith it the very notion of analyticity itself, rested on some\nfundamental mistakes.\n",
