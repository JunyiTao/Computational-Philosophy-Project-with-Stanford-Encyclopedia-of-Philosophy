Although we will introduce and use graphs in\n section 3,\n they will play a more prominent role in\n section 4.\n We will discuss two types of graphs. The first is the directed\nacyclic graph (DAG). A directed graph \\(\\bG\\) on\nvariable set \\(\\bV\\) is a set of ordered pairs of variables in\n\\(\\bV\\). We represent this visually by drawing an arrow from X\nto Y just in case \\(\\langle X, Y\\rangle\\) is in \\(\\bG\\).\n Figure 1\n shows a directed graph on variable set \\(\\bV = \\{S, T, W, X, Y,\nZ\\}\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nA path in a directed graph is a non-repeating sequence of\narrows that have endpoints in common. For example, in\n Figure 1\n there is a path from X to Z, which we can write as \\(X\n\\leftarrow T \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\). A directed path\nis a path in which all the arrows point in the same direction; for\nexample, there is a directed path \\(S \\rightarrow T \\rightarrow Y\n\\rightarrow Z\\). A directed graph is acyclic, and hence a\nDAG, if there is no directed path from a variable to itself. Such a\ndirected path is called a cycle. The graph in Figure 1\ncontains no cycles, and hence is a DAG.\n\nThe relationships in the graph are often described using the language\nof genealogy. The variable X is a parent of Y\njust in case there is an arrow from X to Y. \\(\\bPA(Y)\\)\nwill denote the set of all parents of Y. In\n Figure 1,\n \\(\\bPA(Y) = \\{T, W\\}\\). X is an ancestor of Y\n(and Y is a descendant of \\(X)\\) just in case there is\na directed path from X to Y. However, it will be\nconvenient to deviate slightly from the genealogical analogy and\ndefine \u201cdescendant\u201d so that every variable is a descendant\nof itself. \\(\\bDE(X)\\) denotes the set of all descendants of X.\nIn Figure 1, \\(\\bDE(T) = \\{T,X, Y, Z\\}\\).\n\nAn arrow from Y to Z in a DAG represents that Y\nis a direct cause of \\(Z.\\) Roughly, this means that the\nvalue of Y makes some causal difference for the value of\nZ, and that Y influences Z through some process\nthat is not mediated by any other variable in \\(\\bV\\). Directness is\nrelative to a variable set: Y may be a direct cause of Z\nrelative to variable set \\(\\bV\\), but not relative to variable set\n\\(\\bV'\\) that includes some additional variable(s) that mediate the\ninfluence of Y on \\(Z.\\) As we develop our account of graphical\ncausal models in more detail, we will be able to say more precisely\nwhat it means for one variable to be a direct cause of another. While\nwe will not define \u201ccause\u201d, causal models presuppose a\nbroadly difference-making notion of causation, rather than a\ncausal process notion (Salmon 1984, Dowe 2000) or a mechanistic notion\n(Machamer, Darden, & Craver 2000; Glennan 2017). We will call the\nsystem of direct causal relations represented in a DAG such as\n Figure 1\n the causal structure on the variable set \\(\\bV\\).\n\nA second type of graph that we will consider is an acyclic\ndirected mixed graph (ADMG). An ADMG will contain double-headed\narrows, as well as single-headed arrows. A double-headed arrow\nrepresents a latent common cause. A latent common cause of\nvariables X and Y is a common cause that is not included\nin the variable set \\(\\bV\\). For example, suppose that X and\nY share a common cause L\n (Figure 2(a)).\n An ADMG on the variable set \\(\\bV = \\{X, Y\\}\\) will look like\n Figure 2(b).\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nWe can be a bit more precise. We only need to represent missing common\ncauses in this way when they are closest common causes. That\nis, a graph on \\(\\bV\\) should contain a double-headed arrow between\nX and Y when there is a variable L that is\nomitted from \\(\\bV\\), such that if L were added to \\(\\bV\\) it\nwould be a direct cause of X and Y.\n\nIn an ADMG, we expand the definition of a path to include\ndouble-headed arrows. Thus, \\(X \\leftrightarrow Y\\) is a path in the\nADMG shown in\n Figure 2(b).\n Directed path retains the same meaning, and a directed path\ncannot contain double-headed arrows.\n\nWe will adopt the convention that both DAGs and ADMGs represent the\npresence and absence of both direct causal relationships and\nlatent common causes. For example the DAG in\n Figure 1\n represents that W is a direct cause of Y, that X\nis not a direct cause of Y, and that there are no latent\ncommon causes. The absence of double-headed arrows from Figure 1\ndoes not show merely that we have chosen not to include latent common\ncauses in our representation; it shows that there are no latent common\ncauses.\n",
