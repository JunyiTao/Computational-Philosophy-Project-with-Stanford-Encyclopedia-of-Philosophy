    "main_text": "Art and the absurd\n5. Art and the absurd\n\n\nSo far we have only considered the subjective side of the link\nbetween human revelation of the world and the world itself.\nExistentialism, however, also emphasizes the objective side of the\nlink; that is, the world itself as object of perception and knowledge,\nand as the context in which human action takes place. Here, there are\nsome notable differences between \u2018optimistic\u2019 and\n\u2018tragic\u2019 conceptions of the world in terms of our human\nendeavours.\n\n\nThe \u2018optimistic\u2019 ontologies, like those of Marcel or\nMerleau-Ponty, see the world as being on the whole a welcoming place\nfor human knowledge and action. Marcel, despite his critical analyses\nof what he sees as the ills of modern society, is the most optimistic\nof all, mainly due to the theological grounding of his ontology.\nUltimately there is no gap for him between the yearning for full\nparticipation in the world (including in God) and the world itself,\nsince we owe our very existence and capacity for participation to the\nultimate origin of this world. As he writes in his diary:\n\u201cKnowledge is within being, enfolded by it\u201d (1935, 115).\nAlthough Merleau-Ponty does not share this theological conviction, he\nagrees with Marcel on a crucial point: our incarnation in the world\nthrough our bodies is the fundamental beginning of our learning to\ninhabit the world meaningfully. As a result of our being both in and of\nthe world through our bodies, Merleau-Ponty believes that on the whole\nour presentations of the world reveal objective features of it.\n\n\nThe \u2018tragic\u2019 ontologies of Sartre, de Beauvoir and\nCamus, on the other hand, insist on the inhospitality of the world\ntowards human endeavours insofar as the world is mostly reticent to our\nattempts at introducing meaning and unity into it. For Camus, the\n\u2018absurd\u2019 mainly designates this resistance of the world to our\nendeavours. Whilst we crave for sense and harmony, the world has\nnothing to offer but chaos and a random play of blind forces. All our\nefforts to impose order and sense upon a world that can ultimately\naccommodate neither are therefore doomed to fail. The absurd, then,\ndenominates both the most fundamental state of the world and the\nabsurdity of human attempts at overcoming this basic fact.\n\n\nHowever, whilst Camus\u2019 \u2018absurd\u2019 names the\nessentially tragic state of humanity, it is counterbalanced by his awe\ntowards the indifferent majesty of Nature. For Camus, one of the ways\nof liberating oneself from the illusion of meaning and unity is to open\nup to the beauty of Nature and partake in it, abandoning oneself in\nprivileged moments of hedonistic communion with wild environments, such\nas the rugged Algerian landscape or the Mediterranean, or in eroticism\n(1938a; see the moments of happiness in The Outsider, for\nexample, 1942a, 23\u201324, 116\u2013117).\n\n\nSartre, on the other hand, insists on the \u201cdisgusting\u201d,\n\u201cnauseating\u201d aspect of a world reticent to meaning, order\nand beauty. His first novel, Nausea, painstakingly chronicles\nthis ontological disgust towards the strangeness of the world. A\nproffered hand becomes \u201ca big white worm,\u201d a glass of beer\na hostile partner whose \u201cgaze\u201d the hero attempts to avoid\nfor half an hour; a pebble on the beach reveals the\n\u201cnausea\u201d that is communicated from the world \u201cthrough\nthe hands.\u201d Even here, however, aesthetic experiences trigger\nsome exceptional moments in which the hero manages to escape\nontological \u2018nausea\u2019. This occurs, for example, when the\nnovel\u2019s main character suddenly hears a jazz song in a\ncaf\u00e9, which, like a \u201cband of steel,\u201d points to a\ndifferent time beyond the drudgery of the everyday (Sartre 1938,\n21\u201323).\n\n\nMany of the existentialists\u2019 literary creations attempt to\ndescribe the entanglements of human freedom in these fundamental\nontological features of the world. Admittedly, this applies to some\nexistentialist authors more than others. For instance, Marcel\u2019s\nplays explore the difficulties that modern individuals encounter in\nresponding to the appeal of transcendence, and in giving in to faith\nand hope. But these obstacles arise mainly from social institutions\n(notably around marriage) and historical events (the tragic\ncircumstances of the 20th century and what Marcel sees as\nthe dangerous objectivism of modern society). Similarly, de\nBeauvoir\u2019s novels tend to portray individuals seeking their true\nselves beyond the strictures of social morality. In contrast, a great\npart of Camus\u2019 and Sartre\u2019s literary work is dedicated to\ndescribing the difficulties that people face when trying to find their\nplace, not just in their social, but also in their natural and material\nenvironments. As we have noted, some of the best-known passages in\ntheir literary writings also describe moments in which the\nobtrusiveness of the world is overcome, yielding fleeting yet sublime\nexperiences of sensuous communion with nature and others.\n",
