    "main_text": "Tillers and Soldiers: Ruling the People || Rewards: The Ranks of Merit\n3.2 Rewards: The Ranks of Merit\n\nCoercion aside, positive incentives are equally important for Shang\nYang\u2019s program. As the text readily recognizes, the people are\nnot just the ruler\u2019s potential enemy but are also his major\nasset. Without their hard labor in the fields and bravery on the\nbattlefield, the state is doomed. To motivate them, coercion will not\nsuffice. Rather, to make the \u201cbitter and dangerous\u201d\noccupations of tilling and fighting attractive, one should turn them\ninto the exclusive way to material riches and glory. This\nunderstanding stands at the background of Shang Yang\u2019s most\ncelebrated reform: the replacement of Qin\u2019s traditional\nhereditary aristocratic order with the new system of the ranks of\nmerit.\n\nThe system of 20 (initially fewer) ranks of merit introduced by Shang\nYang was one of the most daring acts of social engineering in human\nhistory. This system became the cornerstone of social life in Qin. The\nlowest ranks were distributed for military achievements, particularly\ndecapitating enemy soldiers, or could be purchased in exchange for\nextra grain yields; some of the successful rank-holders could be\nincorporated into the military or civilian administration and\nthereafter be further promoted up the social ladder. Each rank granted\nits holder economic, social, and legal privileges (e.g. redeeming\nmutilating punishments by paying a fine). Since the ranks were not\nfully inheritable, the system generated considerable social mobility\n(Pines 2016b: 17\u201324; q.v. for further references). The ranks of\nmerit\u2014i.e., rewards\u2014became the major motivating force for\nQin\u2019s subjects, especially on the battlefield. The text\nclarifies:\n\n\nWhen rewards are unified, the army has no rivals. . . . What is called\n\u201cunifying rewards\u201d means that benefits, emoluments,\nofficial position, and rank uniformly derive from military\n[attainments] and that there are no other ways to dispense them.\nTherefore, the knowledgeable and the ignorant, the noble and the base,\nthe courageous and cowardly, the worthy and unworthy\u2014all fully\nutilize their innermost wisdom and fully exhaust the power of their\nlimbs, going forth to die in the service of their superiors. (Book\nof Lord Shang 17.1\u20132, \u201cRewards and\npunishments\u201d)\n\n\nIn the above passage the ranks of merit and adjacent \u201cbenefits,\nemoluments, and official positions\u201d are to be distributed\nexclusively in exchange for military attainments. Elsewhere the text\nsuggests that high grain yields should be another avenue to ranks,\nalthough the latter point remained less developed than rewarding\nmeritorious soldiers (Pines 2021). Differences notwithstanding, one\npoint remains consistent. The efficiency of the system of ranks of\nmerit requires its exclusivity, which in turn can be ensured only\nthrough the government\u2019s control over social, economic, and\npolitical status of the subjects. The text concludes:\n\n\nThose who do not work but eat, who do not fight but attain glory, who\nhave no rank but are respected, who have no emolument but are rich,\nwho have no office but lead\u2014these are called\n\u201cvillains\u201d (Book of Lord Shang 18.6,\n\u201cCharting the policies\u201d).\n\n\nShang Yang is adamant: any group which tries to bypass engagement in\nagriculture and warfare\u2014be these merchants who amass riches\nwithout tilling or talkative intellectuals who seek promotion without\ncontributing to the state economically or militarily\u2014should be\nsuppressed or at least squeezed out of profits. Nothing\u2014neither\nlearning, nor commerce, nor even artisanship\u2014should distract the\npeople from farming and fighting.\n\nNot all aspects of Shang Yang\u2019s program were equally successful.\nThe simplistic emphasis on agriculture only and the recommendation to\nsuppress commerce was eventually abandoned by Qin policy makers (Pines\n2021). Some of the military ideas in the text\u2014e.g., the\ndepiction of the commanders who are more preoccupied with calculating\nthe merits of individual soldiers than directing the battle\u2014also\nappear na\u00efve (Pines 2016c: 123\u2013125). These flaws\nnotwithstanding, overall, Shang Yang\u2019s reforms and the ideas\nexpressed in the Book of Lord Shang should be credited for\nturning the state of Qin into arguably the most formidable military\nmachine in China\u2019s long history.\n",
