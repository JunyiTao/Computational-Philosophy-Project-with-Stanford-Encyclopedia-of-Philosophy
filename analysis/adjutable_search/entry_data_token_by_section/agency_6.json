The standard theory offers an account of\nwhat is, arguably, the most central kind of agency: intentional agency\n(and the kind of unintentional agency that derives from it; see\nsection 2). This can be distinguished from higher or more refined kinds of agency,\nsuch as self-controlled, autonomous, and free agency, and it can be\ndistinguished from more basic kinds of agency that do not require the\nascription of representational mental states. Apart from that, there are\nseveral candidates for further kinds of agency. They include mental\nagency, shared agency, collective agency, relational agency, and\nartificial agency. In each case, we can ask whether the agency in\nquestion can be explained in terms of the standard conception and\ntheory, or whether it is indeed a different kind of agency. The main\nfocus in this section will be on mental agency, and we will address the\nother candidates only very briefly.\nIt may seem obvious that our mental lives are filled with mental\naction. We attend, consider, judge, reason, deliberate, accept,\nendorse, decide, try, and so on. It may seem that these are all things\nthat we do. If we consider such cases through the standard theory of\nagency, we encounter immediately two difficulties. First, it seems\nthat such mental occurrences are hardly ever, if ever, intentional\nactions. According to the standard theory, an event is an intentional\naction of the type A only if the agent has an intention that\nincludes A in its content. In the basic case, this would be\nan intention to A. In an instrumental case, this would be an\nintention to perform some other action B in order\nto A. Now, thoughts are individuated in part by their\ncontents. Take the thought that p. According to the standard\ntheory, thinking that p is an intentional action only if the\nagent has an intention that includes \u201cthink\nthat p\u201d in its content. This is rather odd and\nproblematic, because we would have to have the intention to think a\ncertain thought before we think it. Second, there are problems with\nthe central case of decision-making. According to the standard\ntheory, deciding to A would be an intentional action only if\none already had the intention to make a decision that includes\n\u201cdeciding to A\u201d in its content. This seems,\nagain, rather odd and problematic. Further, our reasons for making a\ndecision to A are usually our reasons\nto A\u2014they are reasons for performing\nthe action. According to the standard theory, something is\nan action only if it has a reason explanation (in terms of the\nagent\u2019s desires, beliefs, and intentions). As reasons are\nusually reasons for action, it is again difficult to see how making a\ndecision can ever be an action. Considerations of this kind may lead\none to conclude that thoughts are hardly ever, if ever, mental actions\n(see Strawson 2003).\nIt is not difficult to avoid this conclusion, as Mele\n(1997, 2003: Ch. 9, 2009b) has shown. Consider again the central case\nof decision-making, and assume that making a decision consists in the\nformation of an intention. According to the standard theory, the\nformation of an intention is an action if it is an intentional action\nunder some description (or if it is either identical with or generated\nby an intentional action; see\nsection 2). What could plausibly be the\nagent\u2019s intention in making a decision? Mele suggests that\nprocesses of decision-making are usually motivated by the intention to\nsettle the practical question at hand. This proposal avoids the\nproblem outlined above. Suppose the agent decides to A. For\nthis to be an action, it is not required that the agent has the\nintention to decide to A. For if the agent has the intention\nto settle the question by making a decision, making the decision is\nintentional under a description. In particular, making a\ndecision is then an intentional action and making the\ndecision to A is then an unintentional action (that is either\nidentical with or generated by the intentional action of\nmaking a\ndecision).[10]\nSimilar considerations apply to the mentioned issue concerning reason\nexplanation and to other cases, such as remembering. Mele (2009b)\nargues that remembering something is never an intentional action,\nbecause no one has ever the intention to remember the particular\ncontent in question. But there is nevertheless a closely associated\nintentional mental action that one might perform: intentionally trying\nto bring it about that one remembers the particular content in\nquestion. See Shepherd (2015) for a defense of the view that decisions are intentional actions by construing them as extensions and conclusions of deliberative activity.\nHieronymi (2009) takes a very different line. She thinks that we\nengage in mental agency whenever we settle the question of whether to\ndo or whether to believe something, and she argues that this kind of\nmental agency differs from ordinary intentional agency, primarily due\nto a difference in control. According to Hieronymi, we have\n\u201cevaluative control\u201d over our mental attitudes. This\nconsists in the ability to form and revise \u201cour take on\nthings\u201d, and it is to be distinguished from the kind of\nvoluntary control that we have over our overt bodily\nactions. According to volitionist theories of agency, mental acts of\nwilling (choosing or trying) are also different in kind from overt\nbodily actions. On such views, mental acts of willing are furthermore\nfundamental, in the sense that they are the source of overt\nagency (Ginet 1990; McCann 1998; Lowe 2008; more on this in\nsection 3.1).\n\nEpistemic agency concerns the control that agents may\nexercise over their beliefs (and other doxastic states). It is common\nto distinguish between two main positions: indirect doxastic\nvoluntarism and direct doxastic voluntarism. The former concerns the\nways in which we may acquire or revise beliefs by doing research,\nevaluating the evidence, considering opposing opinions, and so on. It\nis fairly uncontroversial that we can exercise control over our\nbeliefs in such indirect ways. In contrast, direct doxastic\nvoluntarism is very controversial. It says that we have direct\nvoluntary control over some of our beliefs, where voluntary control is\nusually understood as the kind of control that agents exercise in the\nperformance of intentional actions. A main issue here is that direct\ndoxastic voluntarism appears to be incompatible with the nature of\nbeliefs. Beliefs are supposed to represent the world (or \u201caim at\ntruth\u201d). One may argue that there is no fundamental difference in the\ncontrol over action and belief-formation, because in both cases the\ncontrol consists basically in reason-responsiveness. But this proposal\noverlooks the central role of intentions. According to the standard\ntheory, actions must be initiated and guided by intentions, in\naddition to being responsive to reasons. The challenge is to find\nbeliefs-formations that are initiated and guided by intentions in the\nsame or similar way as intentional actions. (For a more extensive\noverview and references see Vitz 2019.)\nShared agency occurs when two or more individuals do\nsomething together (such as carry a piece of furniture or sing a\nsong). Collective agency occurs when two or more individuals\nact as a group (in accordance with certain principles or procedures\nthat constitute and organize the group). Research on shared and\ncollective agency has flourished over the past two decades or so. One\ncentral question has been whether shared and collective agency can be\nreduced to the agency of the individuals involved, or whether they are\nconstitutive of different kinds of agency\u2014whether they are, in\nsome sense, something over and above individual agency. An account of\ncollective agency in terms of the standard theory raises the question\nof whether it makes sense to attribute mental states and events (such\nas desires, beliefs, and intentions) to groups of individuals. (For\nreferences and discussion see the entries on\nshared agency\nand\ncollective intentionality.)\nThe notion of relational agency derives from relational\naccounts of autonomy. According to feminist critiques, traditional\naccounts of autonomy are overly individualistic, insofar as they\noverlook or neglect the importance of interpersonal relationships in\nthe development and sustenance of an autonomous individual. As\nWestlund (2009) points out, however, most traditional accounts are\ncompatible with the feminist emphasis on interpersonal relationships\nas long as relationships and dependence on others are construed as\nbeing causally necessary for the development and sustenance\nof an individual agent. Autonomy is genuinely relational only if\ninterpersonal relationships and dependence are constitutive\nof autonomy. On Westlund\u2019s own view, autonomous agency requires\nan \u201cirreducibly dialogical form of reflectiveness and\nresponsiveness to others\u201d (2009: 28). On this account, autonomy\nis an irreducibly relational kind of agency. (For more on this see the\nentry on\nfeminist perspectives on autonomy.)\nFinally, we turn briefly to the question of whether robots and\nother systems of artificial intelligence are capable of agency. If one\npresumes the standard theory, one faces the question of whether it is\nappropriate to attribute mental states to artificial\nsystems (see\nsection 2.4). If one takes an instrumentalist stance (Dennett 1987: Ch. 2), there is\nno obvious obstacle to the attribution of mental states\nand intentional agency to artificial systems. According to realist\npositions, however, it is far from obvious whether or not this is\njustified, because it is far from obvious whether or not artificial\nsystems have internal states that ground the ascription of\nrepresentational mental states. If artificial systems are not capable\nof intentional agency, as construed by the standard theory, they may\nstill be capable of some more basic kind of agency. According to\nBarandiaran et al. (2009), minimal agency does not require the\npossession of mental states. It requires, rather, the adaptive\nregulation of the agent\u2019s coupling with the environment and\nmetabolic self-maintenance. This means, though, that on this view\nartificial systems are not even capable of minimal agency: \u201cbeing specific about the requirements for agency\nhas told us a lot about how much is still needed for the development\nof artificial forms of agency\u201d (Barandiaran et al. 2009:\n382). \n",
