As we have already seen, he believes that ethical thinking\ncannot be systematised without intolerable distortions and losses,\nbecause to systematise is, inevitably, to streamline our ethical\nthinking in a reductionist style: \u201cTheory typically uses the\nassumption that we probably have too many ethical ideas, some of which\nmay well turn out to be mere prejudices. Our major problem now is\nactually that we have not too many but too few, and we need to cherish\nas many as we can\u201d (1985: 117). Again, as a normative system,\nutilitarianism is inevitably a systematisation of our responses, a way\nof telling us how we should feel or react. As such it faces\nthe same basic and (for Williams) unanswerable question as any other\nsuch systematisation, \u201cby what right does it legislate\nto the moral sentiments?\u201d (1981: x).\n\nOf course, Williams also opposes utilitarianism because of the\nparticular kind of systematisation that it is\u2014namely, a\nmanifestation of the morality system. Pretty well everything said in\nsections 2 and 3 against morality in general can be more tightly\nfocused to yield an objection to utilitarianism in particular, and\nsometimes this is all we will need to bear in mind to understand some\nspecific objection to utilitarianism that Williams offers. Thus, for\ninstance, utilitarianism in its classic form is bound to face the\nobjections that face any moral system that ultimately is committed to\ndenying the possibility of real moral conflict or dilemma, and the\nrationality of agent-regret. Given its insistence on generality, it\nfaces the \u201cone thought too many\u201d objection as well, at\nleast in any version that keeps criterion of rightness and decision\nprocedure in communication with each other.\n\nAbove all, utilitarianism is in trouble, according to Williams,\nbecause of the central theoretical place that it gives to the ninth\nthesis of the morality system\u2014the thesis that we put on one side\nearlier, about impersonality. Other forms of the morality system are\nimpersonal too, of course, notably Kantianism: \u201cif Kantianism\nabstracts in moral thought from the identity of\n persons,[20]\n utilitarianism strikingly abstracts from their separateness\u201d\n(1981: 3). Like Kantianism, but on a different theoretical basis,\nutilitarianism abstracts from the question of who acts well,\nwhich for utilitarianism means \u201cwho produces good\nconsequences?\u201d. It is concerned only that good consequences be\nproduced, but it does not offer a tightly-defined account of what it\nis for anything to be a consequence. Or rather it does offer an\naccount, but on this account the notion of a consequence is so loosely\ndefined as to be all-inclusive (1971: 93\u201394):\n\nConsequentialism is basically indifferent to whether a state of\naffairs consists in what I do, or is produced by what I do, where that\nnotion is itself wide\u2026 All that consequentialism is interested\nin is the idea of these doings being consequences of what I\ndo, and that is an idea broad enough to include [many sorts of]\nrelations.\n\n\nThis explains why consequentialism has the strong doctrine of negative\nresponsibility that leads it to what Williams regards as its\nfundamental absurdity. Because, for the utilitarian, it can\u2019t\nmatter in itself whether (say) a given death is a result of what I do\nin that I pull the trigger, or a result of what I do in that I refuse\nto lie to the gunman who is looking for the person who dies, doing and\nallowing must be morally on a par for the utilitarian, as also must\nintending and foreseeing. Williams himself is not particularly\nimpressed by those venerable\n distinctions;[21]\n but he does think that there is a real and crucial distinction that\nis closely related to them, and that it is a central objection to\nutilitarianism that it ignores this distinction. The distinction in\nquestion, which utilitarian ignores by being impersonal, is the\ndistinction between my agency and other people\u2019s. It is this\ndistinction, and its fundamental moral importance, that lies at the\nheart of Williams\u2019 famous (but often misunderstood)\n\u201cintegrity objection\u201d.\n\nIn a slogan, the integrity objection is this: agency is always\nsome particular person\u2019s agency; or to put it another\nway, there is no such thing as impartial agency, in the sense of\nimpartiality that utilitarianism requires. The objection is that\nutilitarianism neglects the fact that \u201cpractical deliberation\n[unlike epistemic deliberation] is in every case first-personal, and\nthe first person is not derivative or naturally replaced by [the\nimpersonal] anyone\u201d (1985: 68). Hence we are not\n\u201cagents of the universal satisfaction system\u201d, nor indeed\nprimarily \u201cjanitors of any system of values, even our own\u201d\n(UFA: 118). No agent can be expected to be what a utilitarian agent\nhas to be\u2014someone whose decisions \u201care a function of all\nthe satisfactions which he can affect from where he is\u201d (UFA:\n115); no agent can be required, as all are required by utilitarianism,\nto abandon his own particular life and projects for the\n\u201cimpartial point of view\u201d or \u201cthe point of view of\nmorality\u201d, and do all his decision-making, including (if it\nproves appropriate) a decision to give a lot of weight to his own life\nand projects, exclusively from there. As Williams famously puts it\n(UFA: 116\u2013117):\n\nThe point is that [the agent] is identified with his actions as\nflowing from projects or attitudes which\u2026 he takes seriously at\nthe deepest level, as what his life is about\u2026 It is absurd to\ndemand of such a man, when the sums come in from the utility network\nwhich the projects of others have in part determined, that he should\njust step aside from his own project and decision and acknowledge the\ndecision which utilitarian calculation requires. It is to alienate him\nin a real sense from his actions and the source of his action in his\nown convictions. It is to make him into a channel between the input of\neveryone\u2019s projects, including his own, and an output of\noptimific decision; but this is to neglect the extent to which\nhis projects and his decisions have to be seen as\nthe actions and decisions which flow from the projects and attitudes\nwith which he is most closely identified. It is thus, in the most\nliteral sense, an attack on his integrity.\n\n\nHere, Williams\u2019 commitment to the importance of subjective\nauthenticity is on full display. \u201cThe most literal sense\u201d\nof \u201cintegrity\u201d is, according to Chambers\u2019 Dictionary\n(1977 edition), \u201centireness, wholeness: the unimpaired state of\nanything\u201d; then \u201cuprightness, honesty, purity\u201d. For\nour purposes the latter three senses in this dictionary entry should\nbe ignored. It is the first three that are relevant to Williams\u2019\nargument; the word\u2019s historical origin in the Latin\nin-teger, meaning what is not touched, taken away from, or\ninterfered with, is also revealing.\n\nAn agent\u2019s integrity, in Williams\u2019 sense, is his ability\nto originate actions, to further his own initiatives, purposes or\nconcerns, and thus to be something more than a conduit for the\nfurtherance of others\u2019 initiatives, purposes or\nconcerns\u2014including, for example and in particular, those which\ngo with the impartial view. Moreover, integrity is an essential\ncomponent of character, since, for Williams, an agent\u2019s\ncharacter is identical to their set of deep projects and commitments.\nWilliams\u2019 point, then, is that unless any particular agents are\nallowed to initiate actions and to have \u201cground projects\u201d,\nthen either the agents under this prohibition will be subjects for\nmanipulation by other agents who are allowed to have ground\nprojects\u2014the situation of ideological oppression. Or else, if\nevery agent lies under this prohibition and all agents are made to\nalign themselves only with the ground projects of \u201cthe impartial\npoint of view\u201d, there will not be any agents. To put it\nanother way, all will be ideologically oppressed, but by the ideology\nitself rather than by another agent or group of agents who impose this\nideology. For all agents will then have lost their integrity, in the\nsense that no single agent will be an unimpaired and individual whole\nwith projects of his own that he might identify himself with; all\nagents will have to abandon all \u201cground projects\u201d except\nthe single project that utilitarianism gives them, that of maximising\nutility by whatever means looks most efficient, and to order all their\ndoings around no other initiatives except those that flow from this\nsingle project. What we previously thought of as individual agents\nwill be subsumed as parts of a single super-agent\u2014the\nutilitarian collective, if you like\u2014which will pursue the ends\nof impartial morality without any special regard for the persons who\ncompose it, and which is better understood as a single super-agent\nthan as a group of separate agents who cooperate; rather like a swarm\nof bees or a nest of ants.\n\nIt is important not to misunderstand this argument. One important\nmisunderstanding can arise fairly naturally from Williams\u2019 two\nfamous examples (UFA: 97\u201399) of \u201cJim\u201d, who is told\nby utilitarianism to murder one Amazon villager to prevent twenty\nbeing murdered, and \u201cGeorge\u201d, who is told by\nutilitarianism to take a job making weapons of mass destruction, since\nthe balance-sheet of utilities shows that if George refuses, George\nand his family will suffer poverty and someone else\u2014who will do\nmore harm than George\u2014will take the job anyway. It is easy to\nthink that these stories are simply another round in the familiar game\nof rebutting utilitarianism by counter-examples, and hence that\nWilliams\u2019 integrity objection boils down to the straightforward\ninference (1) utilitarianism tells Jim to do X and George to do Y, (2)\nbut X and Y are wrong (perhaps because they violate integrity?), so\n(3) utilitarianism is false. But this cannot be Williams\u2019\nargument, because in fact Williams denies (2). Not only does he not\nclaim that utilitarianism tells both Jim and George to do the wrong\nthings. He even suggests, albeit rather grudgingly, that\nutilitarianism tells Jim (at least) to do the right thing. (UFA: 117:\n\u201c\u2026if (as I suppose) the utilitarian is right in this\ncase\u2026\u201d) Counter-examples, then, are not the point:\n\u201cIf the stories of George and Jim have a resonance, it is not\nthe sound of a principle being dented by an intuition\u201d (WME\n211). The real point, he tells us, is not \u201cjust a question of\nthe rightness or obviousness of these answers\u201d; \u201cIt is\nalso a question of what sort of considerations come into finding the\nanswer\u201d (UFA: 99). \u201cOver all this, or round it, and\ncertainly at the end of it, there should have been heard \u2018what\ndo you think?\u2019, \u2018does it seem like that to you?\u2019,\n\u2018what if anything do you want to do with the notion of\nintegrity?\u2019\u201d (WME 211).\n\nAgain, despite Williams\u2019 interest in the moral category of\n\u201cthe unthinkable\u201d (UFA: 92\u201393; cp. MSH Essay 4), it\nis not Williams\u2019 claim that either Jim or George, if they are\n(in the familiar phrase) \u201cmen of integrity\u201d, are bound to\nfind it literally unthinkable to work in WMD or to shoot a villager,\nor will regard these actions as the sort of things that come under the\nban of some absolute prohibition that holds (in Anscombe\u2019s\nfamous phrase) whatever the consequences: \u201cthis is a\nmuch stronger position than any involved, as I have defined the\nissues, in the denial of consequentialism\u2026 It is perfectly\nconsistent, and it might be thought a mark of sense, to believe, while\nnot being a consequentialist, that there was no type of action which\nsatisfied [the conditions for counting as morally prohibited no matter\nwhat]\u201d (UFA:\n 90).[22]\n\nNor therefore, to pick up a third misunderstanding of the integrity\nobjection, is Williams offering an argument in praise of \u201cthe\nmoral virtue of integrity\u201d, where \u201cintegrity\u201d\nis\u2014in jejune forms of this misreading\u2014the virtue of doing\nthe right thing not the wrong thing, or\u2014in more sophisticated\nforms\u2014a kind of honesty about what one\u2019s values really are\nand a firm refusal to compromise those values by hypocrisy or\ncowardice (usually, with the implication that one has hold of the\nright values). An agent can be told by utilitarianism to do something\nterrible in order to avoid something even worse, as Jim and George\nare. Williams is not opposing this sort of utilitarian\nconclusion by arguing that the value of \u201cintegrity\u201d in the\nsense of the word that he anyway does not have in mind\u2014the\npersonal quality\u2014is something else that has to be put into the\nutilitarian balance-sheet, and that when you put it in, the\nutilitarian verdict comes out differently. Nor is Williams saying,\neven, that the value of integrity in the sense of the word that he\ndoes have in mind\u2014roughly, allowing agents to be\nagents\u2014is something else that has to be put into the utilitarian\nbalance-sheet, as it is characteristically put in by indirect\nutilitarians such as Peter Railton and Amartya Sen: \u201cThe point\nhere is not, as utilitarians may hasten to say, that if the project or\nattitude is that central to his life, then to abandon it will be very\ndisagreeable to him and great loss of utility will be involved. I have\nalready argued in section 4 that it is not like that; on the contrary,\nonce he is prepared to look at it like that, the argument in any\nserious case is over anyway\u201d (UFA: 116). Williams\u2019 point\nis rather that the whole business of compiling balance-sheets of the\nutilitarian sort is incompatible with the phenomenon of agency as we\nknow it: \u201cthe reason why utilitarianism cannot understand\nintegrity is that it cannot coherently describe the relations between\na man\u2019s projects and his actions\u201d (UFA: 100). As soon as\nwe take up the viewpoint which aims at nothing but the overall\nmaximisation of utility, and which sees agents as no more than nodes\nin the causal network that is to be manipulated to produce this\nconsequence, we have lost sight of the very idea of agency.\n\nAnd why should it matter if we lose sight of that? To say it again,\nthe point of the integrity objection is not that the world will be a\nbetter place if we don\u2019t lose sight of the very idea of agency\n(though Williams thinks this as\n well[23]).\n The point is rather that a world-view that has lost sight of the real\nnature of agency, as the utilitarian world-view has, simply does\nnot make sense: as Williams puts it in the quotation above, it is\n\u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nWhy is it absurd? Because the view involves deserting one\u2019s\nposition in the universe for \u201cwhat Sidgwick, in a memorably\nabsurd phrase, called \u2018the point of view of the\nuniverse\u2019\u201d (1981:\n xi).[24]\n That this is what utilitarianism\u2019s impartial view ultimately\nrequires is argued by Williams in his discussion of Sidgwick at MSH\n169\u2013170:\n\nThe model is that I, as theorist, can occupy, if only temporarily and\nimperfectly, the point of view of the universe, and see everything\nfrom the outside, including myself and whatever moral or other\ndispositions, affections or projects, I may have; and from that\noutside view, I can assign to them a value. The difficulty is\u2026\nthat the moral dispositions\u2026 cannot simply be regarded, least\nof all by their possessor, just as devices for generating actions or\nstates of affairs. Such dispositions and commitments will\ncharacteristically be what gives one\u2019s life some meaning, and\ngives one some reason for living it\u2026 there is simply no\nconceivable exercise that consists in stepping completely outside\nmyself and from that point of view evaluating in toto the\ndispositions, projects, and affections that constitute the substance\nof my own life\u2026 It cannot be a reasonable aim that I or any\nother particular person should take as the ideal view of the\nworld\u2026 a view from no point of view at all.\n\n\nAs Williams also put it, \u201cPhilosophers\u2026 repeatedly urge\none to view the world sub specie aeternitatis; but for most\nhuman purposes\u201d\u2014science is the biggest exception, in\nWilliams\u2019 view\u2014\u201cthat is not a very good\nspecies to view it under\u201d (UFA: 118). The utilitarian\ninjunction to see things from the impartial standpoint is, if it means\nanything, an injunction to adopt the \u201cabsolute conception\u201d\nof the world (1978: 65\u201367). But even if such a conception were\navailable\u2014and Williams argues repeatedly that it is not\navailable for ethics, even if it is for science (1985\nCh.8)\u2014there is no reason to think that the absolute conception\ncould provide me with the best of all possible viewpoints for ethical\nthinking. There isn\u2019t even reason to think that it can provide\nme with a better viewpoint than the viewpoint of my own life. That\nlatter viewpoint does after all have the pre-eminent advantage of\nbeing mine, and the one that I already occupy anyway (indeed cannot\nbut occupy). \u201cMy life, my action, is quite irreducibly mine, and\nto require that it is at best a derivative conclusion that it\nshould be lived from the perspective that happens to be mine is an\nextraordinary misunderstanding\u201d (MSH 170).\n\n(Notice that Williams is also making the point here that there is no\nsense in the indirect-utilitarian supposition that my living my life\nfrom my own perspective is something that can be given a philosophical\nvindication from the impartial perspective, and can then reasonably be\nregarded (by me or anyone else) as justified. Williams sees an\nincoherence at the very heart of the project of indirect\nutilitarianism, because he does not believe that the ambition to\njustify one\u2019s life \u201cfrom the outside\u201d in the\nutilitarian fashion can be coherently combined with the ambition to\nlive that life \u201cfrom the\n inside\u201d.[25]\n The kind of factors that make a life make sense are so different from\nthe kind of factors that utilitarianism is structurally obliged to\nprize that we have every reason to hope that people will not think in\nthe utilitarian way. In other words, it will be best even from the\nutilitarian point of view if no one is actually a utilitarian; which\nmeans that, at best, \u201cutilitarianism\u2019s fate is to usher\nitself from the scene\u201d (UFA: 134).) While some utilitarians have\nclaimed to be unfazed by this result\u2014it does not imply the\nfalsity of utilitarianism qua theory of right\naction\u2014the fact that they continue to publish books and articles\ndefending utilitarianism suggests that they do not really wish for the\ntheory to play no direct role in our moral deliberations.\n\nOn the issue of impartiality, it will no doubt be objected that\nWilliams overstates his case. It seems possible to engage in the kind\nof impartial thinking that is needed, not just by utilitarianism, but\nby any plausible morality, without going all the way to\nSidgwick\u2019s very peculiar notion of \u201cthe point of view of\nthe universe\u201d. When ordinary people ask, as they always have\nasked, the question \u201cHow would you like it?\u201d, or\nwhen Robert Burns utters his famous optative \u201cO wad some\npow\u2019r the giftie gie us/ To see oorselves as ithers see\n us\u201d,[26]\n it does not (to put it mildly) make best sense of what they are\nsaying to attribute to them a faithful commitment to the theoretical\nextravagances of a high-minded Victorian moralist. Can\u2019t\nmorality find a commonsense notion of impartiality that\ndoesn\u2019t involve the point of view of the universe?\nIndeed, if Williams\u2019 own views about impartiality are plausible,\nmustn\u2019t he himself use some such notion?\n\nTo this Williams will reply, we think, that a commonsense notion of\nimpartiality is indeed available\u2014to us, though not to moral\ntheory. The place of commonsense impartiality in our ordinary ethical\nthought is utterly different from the theoretical role of\nutilitarianism\u2019s notion of impartiality. The commonsense notion\nof impartiality is not, unlike the utilitarian notion, a lowest common\ntheoretical denominator for notions of rightness, by reference to\nwhich all other notions of rightness are to be understood. Rather,\ncommonsense impartiality is one ethical resource among\nothers. (Cp. the quotation above from 1985: 117 about avoiding\nsparseness and reduction in our ethical thinking, and\n\u201ccherishing as many ethical ideas as we can\u201d.) Moreover,\nand crucially, Williams\u2019 acceptance of \u201cmethodological\nintuitionism\u201d (see MSH essay 15) commits him to saying that the\nrelation of the commonsense notion of impartiality to other ethical\nresources or considerations is essentially indeterminate: \u201cIt\nmay be obvious that in general one sort of consideration is more\nimportant than another\u2026 but it is a matter of judgement whether\nin a particular case that priority is preserved: other factors alter\nthe balance, or it may be a very weak example of the kind of\nconsideration that generally wins\u2026 there is no reason to\nbelieve that there is one currency in terms of which all relations of\ncomparative importance can be represented\u201d (MSH 190). The\nindeterminacy of the relations between commonsense impartiality and\nother ethical considerations means that commonsense impartiality\nresists the kind of systematisation that moral theory demands. Hence,\nthere is indeed a notion of impartiality that makes sense, and there\nis indeed a notion of impartiality that is available to a moral theory\nsuch as utilitarianism; but the impartiality that is available to\nutilitarianism does not make sense, and the impartiality that makes\nsense is not available to utilitarianism.\n\nWilliams argues, then, that the utilitarian world-view is absurd\nbecause it requires agents to be impartial, not merely in the weak and\neveryday sense that they take impartiality to be one ethical\nconsideration among an unsystematic collection of other considerations\nthat they (rightly) recognise, but in the much stronger, reductive and\nsystematising, sense that they adopt the absolute impartiality of\nSidgwick\u2019s \u201cpoint of view of the universe\u201d.\n\nWe can also say something that sounds quite different, but which in\nthe end is at least a closely related point. We can say that Williams\ntakes the utilitarian world-view to be absurd, because it requires\nagents to act on external reasons. I turn to that way of putting the\npoint in section 5.\n",
