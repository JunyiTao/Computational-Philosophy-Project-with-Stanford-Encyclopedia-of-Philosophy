    "main_text": "\n\nHerbert Simon introduced the term \u2018bounded rationality\u2019\n(Simon 1957b: 198; see also Klaes & Sent 2005) as a shorthand for\nhis brief against neoclassical economics and his call to replace the\nperfect rationality assumptions of homo economicus with a\nconception of rationality tailored to cognitively limited agents.\n\n\nBroadly stated, the task is to replace the global rationality of\neconomic man with the kind of rational behavior that is compatible\nwith the access to information and the computational capacities that\nare actually possessed by organisms, including man, in the kinds of\nenvironments in which such organisms exist. (Simon 1955a: 99)\n\n\n\u2018Bounded rationality\u2019 has since come to refer to a wide\nrange of descriptive, normative, and prescriptive accounts of\neffective behavior which depart from the assumptions of perfect\nrationality. This entry aims to highlight key contributions\u2014from\nthe decision sciences, economics, cognitive- and neuropsychology,\nbiology, computer science, and philosophy\u2014to our current\nunderstanding of bounded rationality.\n",
