    "main_text": "The Singular Term Argument\n4. The Singular Term Argument\n\nThe general argument strategy here has roots in the work of Plato, but\nits first clear formulation was given by Frege (1884, 1892,\n1893\u20131903, and 1919). We begin with a general formulation of the\nargument:\n\nIf a simple sentence (i.e., a sentence of the form\n\u2018a is F\u2019, or \u2018a is\nR-related to b\u2019, or\u2026) is literally\ntrue, then the objects that its singular terms denote exist.\n(Likewise, if an existential sentence is literally true, then there\nexist objects of the relevant kinds; e.g., if \u2018There is an\nF\u2019 is true, then there exist some Fs.)\nThere are literally true simple sentences containing singular\nterms that refer to things that could only be abstract objects.\n(Likewise, there are literally true existential statements whose\nexistential quantifiers range over things that could only be abstract\nobjects.) Therefore,\nAbstract objects exist.\n\n\nPremise (1) follows straightaway from the criterion of ontological\ncommitment that we discussed in the last section. Again, this is\nwidely accepted among contemporary philosophers, and for good reason\n\u2014 if you think that a sentence of the form \u2018a is\nF\u2019 is literally true and that it cannot be paraphrased\ninto some other sentence, then it's hard to see how you can deny that\nthere is such a thing as the object a. Therefore, since (3)\nfollows trivially from (1) and (2), the central question we have to\nanswer, in order to evaluate the above argument, is whether (2) is\ntrue. (Below, I will discuss the possibility of denying (1), but for\nnow I want to focus on (2).) In any event, in order to motivate (2),\nplatonists need to provide some examples; that is, they have to\nproduce some sentences and argue that (i) they contain singular terms\nthat can only be taken as referring to abstract objects (and that\ncan't be paraphrased away) and (ii) they are literally true.\nPlatonists maintain that there are many different kinds of such\nsentences. In what follows, we will consider versions of this argument\nthat attempt to establish the existence of mathematical objects (e.g.,\nnumbers), propositions, properties, relations, sentence types,\npossible worlds, logical objects, and fictional objects.\n",
