    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Non-Maximizing Choice\n4.5 Non-Maximizing Choice\n\nIt would appear that conceptions of justified choice that do not rely\non comparisons avoid the problems posed by incomparability. Stocker\naims to provide one such account of justified choice (1990; 1997). Two\nfeatures help to distinguish his account. First, he argues for\nevaluating alternatives as \u201cthe best\u201d in an absolute,\nrather than a relative, sense. Optimization and maximization rely on\nchoosing \u201cthe best\u201d in a relative sense: given the\nrelevant comparison class, there is no better alternative. To be\n\u201cthe best\u201d in an absolute sense, an alternative\n\u201cmust be, of its kind, excellent\u2014satisfying, or coming\nclose to, ideals and standards\u201d (1997, 206). This is the sense,\nfor example, in which a person can be the best of friends even if we\nmay have even better friends. More generally, an alternative can be\nabsolutely best even if there are better alternatives, and even if an\nalternative is relatively best, it may not be absolutely best. The\nsecond distinctive feature of Stocker\u2019s account is his appeal to\na good life, for example, or part of a good life or project. This\nappeal does not require the alternative to be the best for that life\nor project. Instead, the alternative need only be good enough for that\nlife or project to qualify as a justified choice.\n\nStocker\u2019s account of justified choice differs from the concept\nof \u201csatisficing\u201d as used in the economics and rational\nchoice literature. Introduced into the economics literature by Herbert\nSimon (1955), satisficing is the process of choosing in which it is\nrational to stop seeking alternatives when the agent finds one that is\n\u201cgood enough\u201d (Byron 2004). Where satisficing differs from\nStocker\u2019s account is that satisficing is instrumentally rational\nin virtue of a more general maximizing account of choice. In\nsituations in which finding the best alternative is prohibitively\ncostly or impossible, for example, satisficing becomes rational. In\ncontrast, on Stocker\u2019s account, choosing the alternative that is\n\u201cgood enough\u201d is non-instrumentally rational (Stocker\n2004).\n\nObjections discussed in previous sections may be raised with respect\nto Stocker\u2019s account. Suppose two alternatives are both good in\nan absolute sense and incomparable. According to Stocker\u2019s\naccount, insofar as both alternatives are good enough for an\nagent\u2019s life, the choice of either alternative appears\njustified. As discussed in subsection 4.2, Regan and others may object\nthat the choice of either alternative is not intelligible to the\nagent. Also, the appeal to a good life may raise the worry discussed\nin subsection 4.4 that Stocker\u2019s account addresses the problem\nof incomparability by simply denying it.\n",
