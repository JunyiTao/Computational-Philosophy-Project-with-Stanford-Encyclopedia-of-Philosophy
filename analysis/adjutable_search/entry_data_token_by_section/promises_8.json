    "main_text": "Expectation Theory\n3. Expectation Theory\n\nAs just mentioned, another approach to promissory obligations is an\nappeal to the expectations that promises create in their promisees.\nTheories of this sort claim that promises are designed to invoke\nexpectations of performance in the promisee, and that the betrayal of\nthose expectations is the wrong in breaking a promise, and thus the\nsource of the promissory obligation.\n\nExpectational approaches were initially adopted by consequentialists\nlike Bentham (A Comment on the Commentaries, 1-1-6), Sidgwick\n(The Methods of Ethics, 3\u20136), Narveson (1967, 1971),\nSinger (1972), and \u00c1rdal (1968, 1976). But in the past 50 years\nmany theorists with other normative frameworks have also put forward\nsuch views, e.g., McNeilly (1972), MacCormick (1972), Anscombe (1981:\nCh. 1), Thomson (1990: Ch. 12), T. M. Scanlon (1990, 1999: Ch. 7),\nFoot (2001: Ch. 1), and Friederich and Southwood (2011).\n\nWe can distinguish (along with Friederich & Southwood [2009,\n2011], among others) between three sorts of expectational theories on\nthe basis of what they propose is required on the part of the promisee\nto incur the obligation. The three candidates are assurance, reliance\nand trust.\n",
