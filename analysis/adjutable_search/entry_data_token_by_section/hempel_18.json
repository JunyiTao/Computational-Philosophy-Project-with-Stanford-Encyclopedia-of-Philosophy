What it asserts instead is that every member of\nthe reference class possesses a certain disposition, which in the case\nof statistical laws is of probabilistic strength and in the case of\nuniversal laws of universal strength. On its single-case formulation,\nmoreover, short runs and long runs are simply finite and infinite\nsequences of single cases, where each trial has propensities that are\nequal and independent from trial to trial and classic theorems of\nstatistical inference apply.\n\nEven this intensional explication would still be vulnerable to the\nproblems of irrelevant properties and the modus tollens\nparadox but for the adoption of a condition to exclude the occurrence\nof predicates that are not nomically relevant to the explanandum event\nfrom the explanans of an adequate scientific explanation. This\ncriterion, known as the requirement of strict maximal\nspecificity, permits the reformulation of Hempel\u2019s four\nconditions of adequacy by replacing the redundant empirical content\ncondition with this new requirement (Fetzer 1981; Salmon 1989).\nExplanations not only display the nomic expectability of\ntheir explanandum events\u2014which, in the case of those that occur\nwith high probability, would enable them to have been predicted, as\nHempel proposed but\u2014more importantly\u2014explain them by\nspecifying all and only those properties nomically\nresponsible for their occurrence, even when they occur with low\nprobability (Fetzer 1992).\n\nBromberger\u2019s flagpole counterexample provides a severe test of\nthis requirement. The reason why the inference from the length of the\nshadow to the height of the flagpole is non-explanatory is because the\nlength of the shadow is not nomically responsible for the\nflagpole\u2019s height. Hempel\u2019s original conditions could not\ncope with situations of this kind, where inferences using laws support\npredictions and retrodictions that are not also explanations, even\nthough they satisfy all four. This alternative condition thus requires\nthat the properties cited in the antecedent of the lawlike premise(s)\nmust be nomically relevant to the explanandum or may not be included\nthere (Fetzer 1981, 1992). The height of the flagpole, but not the\nlength of the shadow, qualifies as nomically relevant, which resolves\nthe quandary\u2014at the expense of acknowledging classes of\narguments that are predictive or retrodictive but not\nexplanatory, even when they involve inferences from law(s) that\nsatisfy Hempel\u2019s original criteria. The reformulated conditions\nare:\n\n(CA-1*)\nThe explanandum must be a suitable logical consequence of the\nexplanans; \n(CA-2)\nThe explanans must contain general laws, which are required to\nsatisfy (CA-1*);\n(CA-3*)\nThe explanans must satisfy the requirement of strict maximal\nspecificity; and,\n(CA-4*)\nThe sentences\u2014both of the explanans and of the\nexplanandum\u2014must be true.\n\n\nBy formulating (CA-1*) in this way, the covering law conception of the\nsubsumption of singular events by general laws is preserved; but\nabandonment of the high-probability requirement led both Salmon (1971)\nand Alberto Coffa (1973) to question whether or not explanations still\nproperly qualify as \u201carguments\u201d. At the least, however,\nthey would appear to be special kinds of \u201cexplanatory\narguments\u201d, even when they involve low probabilities.\n\nThese revised conditions implicitly require abandoning Hempel\u2019s\ncommitment to extensional methodology to capture the notion of nomic\nresponsibility, but the benefits of an intensional approach appear to\nbe profound. As Salmon has observed,\n\n\n[on such an explication] the distinction between description and\nprediction, on the one hand, and explanation, on the\nother, is that the former can proceed in an extensional language\nframework, while the latter demands an intensional language framework.\nIt remains to be seen whether the intensional logic can be\nsatisfactorily formulated (Salmon 1989: 172, original emphasis).\n\n\nThis approach to explanation incorporates the causal relevance\ncriterion, according to which a property \\(H\\) is\ncausally relevant to the occurrence of an attribute \\(G\\)\nrelative to a reference property \\(F\\)\u2014within\nthe context of a causal\nexplanation\u2014just in case (CR):\n\n(CR)\n\\((Fxt \\amp Hxt) =m \\Rightarrow Gxt*\\) and \\((Fxt \\amp \\neg Hxt) =n\n\\Rightarrow Gxt*\\), where \\(m \\ne n\\);\n\n\nthat is, the propensity for \\(G\\), given \\(F \\amp H\\), differs from\nthe propensity for \\(G\\), given \\(F \\amp \\neg H\\), where the presence\nor absence of \\(H\\) affects the single-case causal tendency for\n\\(G\\). The universal generalization of sentential functions like these\nthus produces lawlike sentences, while their instantiation to\nindividual constants or to ambiguous names produces (what are known\nas) nomological conditionals (Fetzer 1981: 49\u201354). The\nintroduction of the probabilistic causal calculus \\(C\\), moreover,\nresponds to Salmon\u2019s concerns by providing a formalization\nwithin intensional logic that resolves them (Fetzer & Nute 1979,\n1980). Paul Humphreys (1985, 1989) has argued that \u201cpropensities\ncannot be probabilities\u201d because their causal\ndirectedness precludes satisfying symmetry conditions requiring\nprobabilities from effects to causes as well as from causes to effects\n(on the plausible assumption that there are no propensities for\neffects to bring about their causes). A more linguistically precise\ncharacterization would be that propensities cannot be \u2018standard\nprobabilities\u2019, which has no effect on their role in explanatory\ncontexts.\n",
