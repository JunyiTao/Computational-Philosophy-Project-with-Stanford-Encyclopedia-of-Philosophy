    "main_text": "Hartley\u2019s Observations\u2014At First Sight\n2. Hartley\u2019s Observations\u2014At First Sight\n\nA FRS in regular attendance at the society\u2019s London meetings\nwould be acquainted with Hartley, and would know that he had emerged\nthe victor in a public medical controversy ten years earlier, which\nestablished his reputation in medical circles both in Britain and on\nthe Continent. Hartley, working with Stephen Hales, researched the\nchemical basis for what they thought an effective folk remedy for\nbladder stones\u2014a painful and hazardous condition that impaired\nthe lives of Hartley himself and many others, including Benjamin\nFranklin. In the course of the controversy, Hartley had published a\nself-revealing account of the prolonged and intense suffering he had\nendured, while undergoing the treatment.\n\nThe FRS would know that this orphaned son of a Yorkshire clergyman was\nnow a successful physician, thanks in part to powerful patrons\n(including the Cornwallis family, and the Duke of Newcastle, who was\nin effect prime minister), had come into personal wealth, thanks to\nhis second marriage, and that he had devoted himself to various\nphilanthropic projects, including the publication of the shorthand\nsystem devised by his friend, John Byrom.\n\nIf the FRS knew Hartley as a friend, he would know him to be a\nmathematician with a special interest in statistics, an amateur\nviolinist, and a vegetarian who saw animals as bearing a \u201cnear\nrelation\u201d to humans. He would know him as a husband and father\n(unlike Descartes, Locke, Hume, and Kant). He would know that Hartley\nwas often in extreme pain, and in danger of losing his life, as he\nstill suffered grievously from bladder stones. And he would know him\nto be a man with deeply unconventional religious beliefs.\n\nPicking up the Observations, such a reader would see that the\nbook presented itself as Newtonian science\u2014through the use of\n\u201cObservations\u201d in the title (compare two groundbreaking\nscientific texts, Franklin\u2019s Experiments and Observations on\nElectricity, 1751, and Priestley\u2019s Experiments and\nObservations of Different Kinds of Air, 1774), and through the\ngeometrical format of propositions and corollaries that structure the\ntext. Were he to page through the opening sections, he would see that\nthe Hartley wrote for a reader already familiar with technical\nconcepts in, for example, anatomy and physiology, and in the\nspeculative physics in Newton\u2019s Opticks.\n\nWere the reader to continue beyond the opening propositions of the\nObservations, he would encounter elements of another, older\ntradition: references to \u201cperfect self-annihilation, and the\npure love of God\u201d (OM 2, prop. 67), and quotations of\nselect biblical passages, especially the promise of becoming\n\u201cpartakers of the divine nature\u201d (2 Pet. 1.4). These place\nHartley within the realms of pietism and mysticism.\n\nSpecifically, they are expressions of the \u201ceverlasting\ngospel\u201d of universal salvation. For the Observations\nenvisions the restoration of a fallen, fragmented, and self-alienated\nhumanity to \u201cperfect manhood,\u201d in which all people,\nwithout exception, will be \u201cmembers of the mystical body of\nChrist,\u201d and as such will become \u201cnew sets of senses, and\nperceptive powers, to each other, so as to increase each others\nhappiness without limits\u201d (OM 2, prop. 68; cf. prop.\n35).\n\nNeither the scientific approach to \u201cman\u201d nor the\naffirmation of universal salvation was in itself original. One could\nfind the former in the medical literature, and in Descartes. For\nversions of the \u201ceverlasting gospel\u201d one could turn to\nvarious writers, including Peter Sterry, Cromwell\u2019s chaplain, in\nA Discourse of the Freedom of the Will (1675), Sterry\u2019s\nfellow chaplain to Cromwell, Jeremiah White, in The Restoration of\nAll Things (1712), the visionary Jane Lead, the mathematician\nThomas Bayes, in Divine Benevolence (1731), and, on the\ncontinent, Charles Hector de Marsay.\n\nWhat is distinctive about Hartley\u2019s Observations is the\nsimultaneous presence of the two approaches. Although Hartley affirms\nthat the whole person is a \u201cmechanism,\u201d subject to\nscientific study, he is no French atheist, no La Mettrie (author of\nthe notorious L\u2019Homme machine, 1748), but a person of\ndeep religious sensibility. Similarly, Hartley affirms universal\nrestoration\u2014but with none of the hallucinatory mysticism of Lead\nor Marsay. Rather, the doctrine is supported by an application of the\nlatest scientific thinking.\n\nConsider the full title: Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty,\nand his Expectations. Hartley attempts a synthesis, by showing\nthat bodily \u201cframe,\u201d moral \u201cduty,\u201d and\nreligious \u201cexpectations\u201d all converge on the same\npoint\u2014and that point is the overcoming of the chasm between hell\nand heaven. Recall that Hartley, like other Unitarians, believed the\ndivinity of Jesus and substitutionary atonement to be doctrines that\nobscured the original light of Christianity. Thus an explanation of\n\u201csalvation\u201d as something external and undeserved has no\npart in his thinking. Rather, he offers a scientific account of how we\nare framed, both physically and psychologically, so as ultimately to\nattain the state in which we are all be \u201cpartakers of the divine\nnature, loving and lovely, holy and happy\u201d (OM 2, prop.\n56).\n",
