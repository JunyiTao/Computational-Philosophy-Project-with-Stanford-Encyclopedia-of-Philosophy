    "main_text": "Defending the Dharma: A Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows || Introducing the Work\n3.1 Introducing the Work\n\nThe Three\n Vows[8]\n is a polemical treatise, and it is Sapa\u1e47\u2019s most\ncontroversial work. It is an assemblage of distinct doctrinal\narguments directed against Sapa\u1e47\u2019s Tibetan contemporaries,\norganized under the rubric of three sets of vows. The categories of\nvows refer to the three main categories of Buddhist theory and\npractice: (1) Disciples\u2019 (\u015br\u0101vaka) monastic\nvows, (2) Great Vehicle (mah\u0101y\u0101na) or bodhisattva\nvows, and (3) Mantra/Tantra vows. Before it ever reached Tibet,\nBuddhism in India had developed through these three forms, each with\nits own more-or-less distinct philosophical and ritual framework. Even\nas later systems became preeminent, however, earlier stages of\nBuddhist practice were kept, integrated into lower rungs in a complex\n system.[9]\n Yet although Buddhist intellectuals in India and Tibet took on this\nsystematizing theoretical work, there was never a single institution\ncapable of preventing innovation and experimentation in ritual and\ndoctrine, and over the centuries numerous practices crossed the\nlines ideally set (often after the fact) between the categories. \nConsequently, there were evident divergences between\nidealized systems and their practiced realities, and many conservative\ninstitutional leaders in Tibet during the later diffusion period\n(spyi dar) sought to reign in all errors, but especially\nthose that upset the structured hierarchies of tantric Buddhism.\n\nIn the Three Vows, then, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s central concern\nwas to correct errors in his contemporaries\u2019 theories and\npractices, so as to preserve the integrity and the effectiveness of\nthe teachings. As mentioned above, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s linguistic\ntraining made him confident that he had a better understanding of\nauthentic, Indian sources than most of his contemporaries. He\ntherefore adopts a critical stance against what he considers Tibetan\ninnovations, but his concerns are not merely clerical, and he is not\nsimply nostalgic or obedient to tradition. Nor, if we take him at his\nword, is he simply writing for political gain. On the contrary, he\nprovides a vociferous defense of the use of scripture and reasoning to\nprotect Buddhist doctrine, and he emphasizes the unfairness of those\nwho would claim his critiques are motivated by hostility or jealousy\n(III.625ff.; Rhoton 2002: 178\u2013181). Rather, as he explains near\nthe end of the work, careful and informed analysis is crucial because\neven practices that closely resemble authentic ones can undermine the\nteachings, if they fail to properly follow key points (III.432; Rhoton\n2002: 152). In this context, he concisely summarizes the\n\u201cessentials\u201d he considers sacrosanct for each of the three\ntraditions: For the tradition of the Disciples, they are the monastic\nvows and the four truths; for the Great Vehicle, the thought of\nenlightenment and the discipline of the perfections; and for the\nMantra tradition, the initiation and the two processes of generation\nand completion. If you get these wrong, practice becomes essentially\nnon-Buddhist and most importantly, ineffective. He sees his critiques\nas, above all, practical soteriology.\n\nUnder this umbrella, Sapa\u1e47 lists ten fallacious doctrines, which\nhe considers a particular threat to the essential teachings in his\nday:\n\n Disciples\u2019 vows are taken to last until\nenlightenment;\n Mind-only rites for bodhisattvas are given to\nall;\n It is taught that bodhicitta (the\nbodhisattva\u2019s altruistic mindset) should not be cultivated in\nmeditation through the exchange of self and other;\n Initiations are deemed unnecessary for Mantra\npractice and are substituted with the Vajra Sow blessing;\n People have faith in teachers who have not cultivated\nthe two (tantric) processes;\n People are instructed not to visualize the\nguru on top of one\u2019s head;\n The Realm of Reality (dharmadh\u0101tu) is\nmade into an object of dedication, called \u201cexistent\nvirtue\u201d;\n Instead of means and emptiness, a state of bare\nnon-elaboration is taught, called \u201cthe White Self-sufficient\nRemedy\u201d;\n \u201cDreamed\u201d bodhicitta;\n Abrupt visualization of tutelary\n deities.[10]\n\n\n\nThese ten errors are by no means the limit of the topics covered in\nthe Three Vows, but they represent the kinds of issues that\nmotivate the work, and they stand at the center of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ndoctrinal disputes with his adversaries. Many of these are reiterated\nthroughout his works\u2014also appearing, for instance, as topics of\ndiscussion in the Sage\u2019s Intent or the Gateway to\nLearning. Here is not the place to examine each of these, which\nwould take us into some rather arcane particulars. Still, although\nmany of these points enact scholastic in-fighting and might seem on\nthe surface to be doctrinal angel-counting, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\narguments generally present them as examples of larger concerns. The\ninteresting interpretive question for each, then, is how getting a\ngiven idea wrong disrupts the essentials of the teachings, and what\nthis tells us about Sapa\u1e47\u2019s approach to the doctrine and\nthe controversies of his time. Here I will focus on two critiques\n (1\n &\n 7)\n and mention a third\n (4).\n I will discuss Sapa\u1e47\u2019s view of\n (8)\n in the section on the Sage\u2019s Intent. These are\ninteresting in themselves, and should be sufficient to introduce\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s argumentative style and his philosophical approach\nin this work. I have taken extra space for this section of the entry\nto present\n (7),\n which is one of Sapa\u1e47\u2019s most important arguments, and to\ndiscuss the work\u2019s important, repeating defense of moral\ncontextualism.\n",
