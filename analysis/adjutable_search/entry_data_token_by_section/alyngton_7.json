    "main_text": "The Semantics of Second Intentions\n8. Alyngton in the History of Medieval Thought\n\nAlyngton\u2019s theory of categories is an interesting example of\nthat partial dissolution of the traditional doctrine which took place\nin between the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th\ncenturies. Within Alyngton\u2019s metaphysics, (1) the relationships\nbetween primary (or individual) substances and secondary (or\nuniversal) substances, and (2) between substances and accidents (both\nabstract and concrete) as well as (3) the inner natures of essential\nand accidental predications are so different from their Aristotelian\noriginals that the general meaning of the categorial doctrine is\ndeeply modified. According to Alyngton, the formal-and-essential\npredication and the formal-and-accidental predication would correspond\nto Aristotle\u2019s essential and accidental predications\nrespectively. But he regards remote inherence as more general than\nformal predication. Therefore, in his system formal predication is a\nsort of sub-type of the remote inherence. This means that he\nrecognises a single ontological pattern, founded on a partial\nidentity, as the basis of every kind of predicative relation. Thus,\nthe praedicatio formalis essentialis and the praedicatio\nformalis accidentalis are very different from their Aristotelian\nmodels, as they express degrees in identity as well as the remote\ninherence. As a consequence, the relationships between substance and\naccidents and between individuals and universals (and hence the\nontological status of universal substances and that of accidents) are\ncompletely changed. In Alyngton\u2019s view, both concrete accidents,\nqua modes of individual substances, and universal substances, qua the\nmain components of the natures of individual substances, are really\nidentical-to and formally distinct-from primary substances. Moreover,\nin the Categories Aristotle (1) characterizes primary\nsubstances as those beings which are neither present in a subject nor\npredicable of a subject, and (2) considers the capacity of underlying\naccidents as the constitutive principle of substance, while Alyngton\n(1) defi nes primary substance as what (i) is apt to underlie potency\nand act, and (ii) has matter and form as its inner foundations, and\n(2) explicitly affi rms that underlying accidents is only a derivative\nproperty of substance. Finally, because of his strong propensity\ntowards hypostatization (as we have seen, Alyngton methodically\nreplaces logical and epistemological rules with ontological criteria\nand references), he interprets Aristotle\u2019s theory of homonymy,\nsynonymy, and paronymy as an ontological theory about real items and\nnot as a semantic one about the relations between terms and things. In\nconclusion, Alyngton conflates the real and logical (so to say) levels\ninto one: just like Burley and Wyclif , he considers logic as the\ntheory of the discourse on being, turning on structural forms and\nrelations, which exist in the world and are totally independent of the\nmental acts by which they are grasped. It is through these structural\nforms and relations that the network connecting the basic items of\nreality (individuals and universals, substances and accidents) is\nclearly disclosed. Yet, because of his peculiar ideas on substance and\npredication, his world is different from those of Burley and of\nWyclif. On Burley \u2019s view, macro-objects (i.e., what is\nsignified by a proper name or by an individual expression, such as\n\u2018Socrates \u2019 or \u2018this particular horse\u2019) are\nthe basic components of the world. They are aggregates made up of\nreally different items: primary substances and substantial and\naccidental forms existing in them. Primary substances and substantial\nand accidental forms are like simple (or atomic) objects, each\npossessing a unique, well-defi ned nature. Although they are simple,\nsome of these components are in a sense composite because they are\nreducible to something else \u2013 for example, primary substance is\ncomposed of a particular form and matter. Primary substance differs\nfrom the other components of a macro-object because of its peculiar\nmode of being as an autonomous and independently existing object, in\ncontrast with the other categorial items, which necessarily presuppose\nit for their existence. Primary substances are therefore substrates of\nexistence in relation to everything else. The distinction between\nsubstantial and accidental forms derives from their different\nrelations to primary substances: substantial, universal forms disclose\nthe natures of primary substances; by contrast, those forms that\nsimply affect primary substances without being actually joined to\ntheir natures are accidental forms. As a result, the macro-object is\nnot simply a primary substance but an orderly collection of categorial\nitems, so that primary substance, even though it is the most important\nelement, does not contain the whole being of the macro-object. On\nWyclif \u2019s view, whatever is is a proposition\n(pan-propositionalism). The constitutive property of any kind of being\nis the capacity of being the object of a complex act of signifying.\nThis choice implies a revolution in the standard medieval theory of\ntranscendentals, since Wyclif actually replaces being with true.\nAccording to the common belief, verum was nothing but being\nitself considered in relation to an intellect, no matter whether\ndivine or human. According to Wyclif, being is no more the main\ntranscendental and its notion is not the first and simplest, but there\nis something more basic to which being can be brought back: the truth\n(veritas) (or true, verum). Only what can be signifi\ned by a complex expression is a being, and whatever is the proper\nobject of an act of signifying is a truth. \u2018Truth\u2019 is\ntherefore the true name of being itself. From the ontological point of\nview this entails the uniqueness in type of the significata\nof every class of categorematic expressions. Within Wyclif \u2019s\nworld it is the same (kind of ) object which both concrete terms and\npropositions refer to, as primary substances have to be regarded as\n(atomic) states of affairs. According to him, from the metaphysical\npoint of view a singular man, for instance, is nothing but a real\nproposition, with its real suject (the concrete existence in time of\nthat singular thing, say Socrates), its real predicate (the common\nnature, i.e., the human nature viewed qua universal), and its copula\n(the singular essence, i. e., the individual essence of Socrates). The\nresult is that Wyclif \u2019s world consists of molecular objects,\nwhich are not simple, but composite, because they are reducible to\nsomething else, belonging to a different rank of reality, and unable\nto exist by itself: being and essence, potency and act, matter and\nform, abstract genera, species and differences. For that reason,\neverything one can speak about or think of is both a thing (or\nmolecular object) and a sort of atomic state of affairs, while every\ntrue proposition expresses either an atomic or a molecular state of\naffairs, that is the union (if the proposition is affirmative) or the\nseparation (if the proposition is negative) of two (or more) molecular\nobjects. On the contrary, Alyngton\u2019s world consists of atomic\nobjects whose constitutive elements are abstract forms (or essences),\nboth substantial and accidental, potency and act, and matter. In fact,\naccording to him, unlike Burley, what is signified by a proper name or\nby an individual expression is a primary substance, and, unlike\nWyclif, simple and complex expressions have different\nsignificata. Moreover, in his view, Socrates cannot be\nregarded as an aggregate, since the beings of the substantial\nuniversal forms predicated of him and those of the concrete accidental\nforms inhering in him coincide with the being of that primary\nsubstance Socrates himself is. Thus, if we consider Socrates from the\npoint of view of his being, Socrates is simply an atomic object, a\nprimary substance. If we consider him from the point of view of the\nessences that he contains in himself, then he is a compound of really\ndifferent forms, which can exist only in it, as its components, and\nthrough its being. This is the inner sense (1) of the formula\n\u2018really identical and formally distinct\u2019 that Alyngton\nemploys for explaining the relation between universals and individuals\nas well as the relation between substance and concrete accidents; and\n(2) of his description of the nature and peculiar mode of being of the\nprimary substance: to be a primary substance is to be the\nbeing of whatever can be.\n",
