    "main_text": "\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\n4. \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\n\nAt the beginning of this entry we have addressed briefly the question\nof motivating the PSR. The PSR demands that all facts must have a\nsufficient explanation, and were the PSR itself unmotivated, it would\nseem to simply refute itself. We have also seen that overall\nLeibniz\u2019s attempts to justify the PSR were not particularly\nsuccessful (in Spinoza\u2019s early works there is an attempt to\njustify the PSR, but he deserted this path in his later works). In\nthis section, we would like to discuss one of the most intriguing\nattempts to justify the PSR as an exceptionless methodological\nprinciple. The arguments we are about to discuss appear in\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s 1740 Institutions de\nphysique (Foundations of Physics) \u201costensibly a\ntextbook in physics for her son, but in reality, a highly original\nwork in natural philosophy\u201d (Detlefsen 2018, \u00a71). In this\nwork, Du Ch\u00e2telet attempts to provide a unified Newtonian\nnatural philosophy that is grounded in metaphysics. Just like Leibniz,\ndu Ch\u00e2telet views the principle of contradiction and the\nprinciple of sufficient reason as the two fundamental principles of\nphilosophy.\n\nImmediately after presenting the PSR, Du Ch\u00e2telet turns to\njustify the principle:\n\n\nIf we tried to deny this great principle, we would fall into strange\ncontradictions. For as soon as one accepts that something may happen\nwithout sufficient reason, one cannot be sure of anything, for\nexample, that a thing is the same as it was the moment before, since\nthis thing could change at any moment into another of a different\nkind; thus truths, for us, would exist only for an instant.\n\nFor example, I declare that all is still in my room in the state in\nwhich I left it, because I am certain that no one has entered since I\nleft; but if the principle of sufficient reason does not apply, my\ncertainty becomes a chimera since everything could have been thrown\ninto confusion in my room, without anyone having entered who was able\nto turn it upside down (Foundations of Physics, \u00a78| Du\nCh\u00e2telet 2009, 129)\n\n\nWithout the PSR, claims Du Ch\u00e2telet, we cannot be certain that\nthe unexperienced world has the continuity and unity we always assume.\nWere we not to assume the PSR, we should be seriously concerned about\nthe possibility of things appearing out of thin air and disappearing\ninto nothing. Without the PSR, we cannot assume the permanence of\nanything. The very fact that we are not concerned about the sudden\nappearance or disappearance of things, seems to indicate that we\nactually assume the PSR. Moreover, claims Du Ch\u00e2telet, our very\nfoundational notions of equality and identity, seem to assume the\nprinciple:\n\n\nWithout this principle there would not be identical things, for two\nthings are identical when one can substitute one for the other without\nany change to the properties which are being considered. This\ndefinition is accepted by everyone. Thus, for example, if I have a\nball made out of stone, and a ball of lead, and I am able to put the\none in the place of the other in a basin of a pair of scales without\nthe balance changing, I say that the weight of these balls is\nidentical, that is the same, and that they are identical in\nterms of weight. If something could happen without a sufficient\nreason, I would be unable to state that the weight of the balls is\nidentical, at the very instant when I find that it is identical, since\na change could happen in one and not the other for no reason at all\n(Foundations of Physics, \u00a78| Du Ch\u00e2telet 2009,\n129)\n\n\nWhen we compare two balls on a scale and infer that their weight is\nequal from the fact that neither side of the scale drops lower, we\nassume that the scales do not remain balanced without a reason.\nHowever, if thing could happen without reason, our inference would be\nunwarranted.\n\nAccording to some commentators, Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s last\nargument shows not only that everything must have a sufficient reason,\nbut also that this reason must be accessible to us (i.e.,\nhumans, or finite cognizers), at least in principle (Amijee 2021 and\nWells 2021). Here is why. Consider the scales scenario in a world in\nwhich the PSR obtains strictly (and we are aware of this), but some\nreasons are in principle inaccessible to us. In such a world, we could\nnot infer with certainty the equality of the balls from the horizontal\nstates of the scales, since we should consider the possibility of\ninterfering causes that are inaccessible to us.\n\nA version of the PSR which requires that all reasons must be\naccessible to humans is not easy to accept: why should we assume that\nthe nature of the world is such that it is cognitive accessible to any\nspecific being? Of course, an anthropocentric version of the PSR might\nbe warranted if one assumes that the world was created by a benevolent\ncreator who intentionally designed the world in such a manner that it\nwill always be accessible to human beings, but this cluster of heavy\npremises would be clearly rejected by many proponents of the PSR (such\nas Spinoza).\n\nSetting aside the question of whether Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s last\nargument indeed requires that reasons must be accessible to humans, it\nseems she does offer a promising line of motivating the PSR as a\nregulative rather than a factive principle (see \u00a71 above). \n",
