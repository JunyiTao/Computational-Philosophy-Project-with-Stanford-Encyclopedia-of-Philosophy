    "main_text": "\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that human activities are changing the\nclimate\n system.[1]\n The emission of greenhouse gases is resulting in increased\ntemperatures, rising sea-levels, and severe weather events (such as\nstorm surges). These climatic changes raise a number of issues of\njustice. These include (but are not limited to) the following\n\nHow do we assess the impacts of climate change?\nWhat climate responsibilities do current generations have to\nfuture generations?\nHow should political actors take into account the risks and uncertainties\ninvolved in climate projections?\nWho has what responsibilities to address climate change?\nGiven that there is a limited \u201cgreenhouse gas budget\u201d\nhow should it be distributed?\nWhat constraints should regulate and constrain climate\npolicies?\nGiven high levels of noncompliance with climate responsibilities\nhow should we make trade-offs between competing principles of climate\njustice?\n\n\nBefore considering these normative issues, it is important to\nintroduce some scientific terms. Climate scientists often refer to\n\u201cmitigation\u201d and\n\u201cadaptation\u201d. Mitigation involves either reducing\nthe emission of greenhouse gases or creating greenhouse gas sinks\n(which absorb greenhouse gases), or both. Adaptation involves\nmaking changes to people\u2019s context so that they can cope better\nwith a world undergoing climatic changes. Examples of adaptation might\nbe constructing buildings that can cope better with extreme heat, or\nbuilding seawalls that can cope with storm surges. It is arguable that\nthis typology is incomplete. Suppose that humans do not mitigate by enough so the climate system continues to change; and\nsuppose that human societies also fail to implement the necessary \nadaptation policies and so people are unable to enjoy the kinds of lives to\nwhich they are entitled. Then, many would argue, they are entitled to\ncompensation.\n",
