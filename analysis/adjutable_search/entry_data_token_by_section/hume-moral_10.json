    "main_text": "Honesty with Respect to Property || The Motive of Honest Actions\n10.3 The Motive of Honest Actions\n\n\nDoes this account resolve the circularity problem? Is there any\nnon-moral motive of honest action? Some interpreters say yes, it is\ngreed redirected, which removes the circle. But this presents two\ndifficulties: first, our greed is not in fact best satisfied by just\naction in every case, and second, Hume denies that this motive is\napproved. Some interpret Hume as coping with the first difficulty by\nsupposing that politicians and parents deceive us into thinking,\nfalsely, that every individual just act advances the interests of the\nagent; or they claim that Hume himself mistakenly thought so, at least\nin the Treatise (see Baron, Haakonssen, and Gauthier). Others\nclaim that Hume identifies a non-moral motive of honest action (albeit\nan artificial one) other than redirected greed, such as a disposition\nto treat the rules of justice as themselves reason-giving (Darwall) or\nhaving a policy of conforming to the rules of justice as a system\n(Garrett).  Still others say there is no non-moral motive of honest\naction, and Hume escapes from the circle by relaxing this ostensibly\nuniversal requirement on virtuous types of behavior, limiting it to\nthe naturally virtuous kinds. These interpreters either claim that\nthere is no particular motive needed to evoke approval for conformity\nto the rules of property \u2014 mere behavior is enough (Mackie)\n\u2014 or that we approve of a motivating form of the moral sentiment\nitself, the sense of duty (Cohon).\n\n\nHume\u2019s genetic account of property is striking for its lack of\npatriarchal assumptions about the family, its explicit denial that the\ncreation of ownership does or can depend on any promise or contract,\nand its concept of convention as an informal practice of mutual\ncompromise for mutual advantage that arises incrementally and entirely\ninformally, without the use of central authority or force.\n",
