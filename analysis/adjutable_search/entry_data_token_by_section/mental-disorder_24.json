Mental differences, it asserts, are equally natural\nand valuable, and no one type of functioning is more correct or valid\nthan another. Analogies are drawn with differences of gender,\nethnicity and culture, including analogies involving social power\ninequalities. From its ready application to disorders on the autism\nspectrum, efforts have been made to apply the neurodiversity position\nmore broadly, including to the symptoms of schizophrenia.
