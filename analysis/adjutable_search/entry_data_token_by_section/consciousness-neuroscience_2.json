    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness\n1.3 Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness\n\nAn important distinction separates access consciousness from\nphenomenal consciousness (Block 1995). \u201cPhenomenal\nconsciousness\u201d refers to those properties of experience that\ncorrespond to what it is like for a subject to have those\nexperiences (Nagel 1974 and the entry on\n qualia).\n These features are apparent to the subject from the inside, so\ntracking them arguably depends on one\u2019s having the relevant\nexperience. For example, one understands what it is like to see red\nonly if one has visual experiences of the relevant type (Jackson\n1982).\n\nAs noted earlier, introspection is the first source of evidence about\nconsciousness. Introspective reports bridge the subjective and\nobjective. They serve as a behavioral measure that expresses the\nsubject\u2019s own take on what it is like for her in having an\nexperience. While there have been recent concerns about the\nreliability or empirical usefulness of introspection (Schwitzgebel\n2011; Irvine 2012a), there are plausibly many contexts where\nintrospection is reliable (Spener 2015; see Irvine 2012b for an\nextended discussion of introspection in consciousness science; for\nphilosophical theories, see Smithies & Stoljar 2012).\n\nIntrospective reports demonstrate that the subject can access the\ntargeted conscious state. That is, the state is\naccess-conscious: it is accessible for use in reasoning,\nreport, and the control of action. Talk of access-consciousness must\nkeep track of the distinction between actual access versus\naccessibility. When one reports on one\u2019s conscious\nstate, one accesses the state. Thus, access consciousness provides\nmuch of the evidence for empirical theories of consciousness. Still,\nit seems plausible that a state can be conscious even if one does not\naccess it in report so long as that state is accessible. One\ncan report it. Access-consciousness is usually defined in\nterms of this dispositional notion of accessibility. \n\nWe must also consider the type of access/accessibility. Block\u2019s\noriginal characterization of access-consciousness emphasized\naccessibility in terms of the rational control of behavior,\nso we can summarize his account as follows:\n\n\nA representation is access-conscious if it is poised for free use in\nreasoning and for direct \u201crational\u201d control of action and\nspeech.\n\n\nRational access contrasts with a broader conception of\nintentional access that takes a mental state to be\naccess-conscious if it can inform goal-directed or intentional\nbehavior including behavior that is not rational or done for a reason.\nThis broader notion allows for additional measurable behaviors as\nrelevant in assessing phenomenal consciousness especially in\nnon-linguistic animals. So, if access provides us with evidence for\nphenomenal consciousness, this can be (a) through introspective\nreports; (b) through rational behavior, (c) through intentional\nbehavior including nonrational behavior. Indeed, in certain contexts,\nreflexive behavior provides measures of consciousness\n (section 2.3).\n",
