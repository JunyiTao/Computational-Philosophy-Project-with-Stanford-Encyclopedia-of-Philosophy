    "main_text": "Contextual Reasoning\n12. Prospects for a Logical Theory of Practical Reason\n\n\nThere is reason to hope that the combination of logical\nmethods with planning applications in AI can enable the development of\na far more comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning\nthan has heretofore been possible. As with many problems having to do\nwith common sense reasoning, the scale and complexity of the\nformalizations that are required are beyond the traditional techniques\nof philosophical logic. However, with computational methods of\nimplementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as\ncognitive robotics to serve as laboratories for developing and testing\nideas, we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little\nprogress since it was first proposed by Aristotle: the problem of\ndevising a formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely\napplicable to common sense reasoning problems. \n\n\nThe classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von Wright\n(see\n von Wright 1983)\n is one source of\nideas; see\n (Horty 2001,\n van der Torre 1997).\n In fact, as the\nmore recent work in deontic logic shows, nonmonotonic logic provides a\nnatural and useful supplement to the classical deontic logic.  One\nrecent work (Horty 2012) seeks \nto base deontic logic on a prioritized version of Reiter\u2019s default logic.\n\n\n\nAn even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge\nwhen these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of\nplanning and reasoning about action that were discussed in\n Section 4,\n above. But this development can be pursued\neven further, by extending the formalism to include preferences and\nintentions.[42]\n\n\nUltimately, what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning\nand acting agent. Developing such a model need not be entirely a matter\nof logic, but according to one school of thought, logic has a central\nrole to play in it; see, for instance,\n Baral & Gelfond 2000,\n Wobcke et al. 1998,\n Rao & Georgeff 1991,\n Burkhard et al. 1998).\n",
