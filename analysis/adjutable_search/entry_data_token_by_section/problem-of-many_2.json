    "main_text": "Overpopulation\n3. Overpopulation\n\nA simple solution to the puzzle is to reject premise 2. Each of the\nrelevant fusions of water droplets looks and acts like a cloud, so it\nis a cloud. As with the first option this leads to some very\ncounterintuitive results. In any room with at least one person, there\nare many millions of people. But this is not as bad as saying that\nthere are no people. And perhaps we don\u2019t even have\nto say the striking claim. In many circumstances, we quantify\nover a restricted domain. We can say, \u201cThere\u2019s no\nbeer,\u201d even when there is beer in some non-salient locales. With\nrespect to some restricted quantifier domains, it is true that there\nis exactly one person in a particular room. The surprising result is\nthat with respect to other quantifier domains, there are many millions\nof people in that room. The defender of the overpopulation theory will\nhold that this shows how unusual it is to use unrestricted\nquantifiers, not that there really is only one person in the room.\n\nThe overpopulation solution is not popular, but it is not without\ndefenders. J. Robert G. Williams (2006) endorses it, largely because\nof a tension between the supervaluationist solution (that will be\ndiscussed in section 7) and what supervaluationism says about the\nSorites paradox. James Openshaw (2021) and Alexander Sandgren\n(forthcoming) argue that the overpopulation solution is true, and each\noffer a theory of how singular thought about the cloud is possible\ngiven overpopulation. Sandgren also points out that there might be\nmultiple sources of overpopulation. Even given a particular set of\nwater droplets, some metaphysical theories will say that there are\nmultiple objects those droplets compose, which differ in their\ntemporal or modal properties. \n\nHudson (2001: 39\u201344) draws out a surprising consequence of the\noverpopulation solution as applied to people. Assume that there are\nreally millions of people just where we\u2019d normally say there was\nexactly one. Call that person Charlie. When Charlie raises her arm,\neach of the millions must also raise their arms, for the millions\ndiffer only in whether or not they contain some borderline skin cells,\nnot in whether their arm is raised or lowered. Normally, if two people\nare such that whenever one acts a certain way, then so must the other,\nwe would say that at most one of them is acting freely. So it looks\nlike at most one of the millions of people around Charlie are free.\nThere are a few possible responses here, though whether a defender of\nthe overpopulation view will view this consequence as being more\ncounter-intuitive than other claims to which she is already committed,\nand hence whether it needs a special response, is not clear. There are\nsome other striking, though not always philosophically relevant,\nfeatures of this solution. To quote Hudson:\n\nAmong the most troublesome are worries about naming and singular\nreference \u2026 how can any of us ever hope to successfully refer\nto himself without referring to his brothers as well? Or how might we\nhave a little private time to tell just one of our sons of our\naffection for him without sharing the moment with uncountably many of\nhis brothers? Or how might we follow through on our vow to practice\nmonogamy? (Hudson 2001: 39)\n\n",
