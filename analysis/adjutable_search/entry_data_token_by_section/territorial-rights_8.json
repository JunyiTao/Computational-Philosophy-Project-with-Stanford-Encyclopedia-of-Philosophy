    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Natural law theories updated\n3.1 Natural law theories updated\n\nAs noted above, one of the key problems with Grotius\u2019s account\nof territory is that it failed to explain the scope of the\nstate. Jurisdiction was based on possession but possession was defined\ndescriptively: a group could come to possess land through force or\nthrough public claims, but it was not clear how the scope or extent of\nthe possession was defined normatively or how it could be limited. One\nof the key contemporary defenders of Grotius\u2014Mathias\nRisse\u2014attempts to update Grotius\u2019s account by developing a\nprinciple or set of principles designed to address this problem.\n\nIn a series of articles with Michael Blake and a book Global\nJustice and Common Ownership of the Earth, Risse argues that the\nkey Grotian insight is that our institutional practices should reflect\nthe \u201ccore idea\u201d of common ownership, which \n\n\nis that all co-owners ought to have an equal opportunity to satisfy\nbasic needs to the extent that this turns on collectively owned\nresources. (Risse 2012; 2014: 112) \n\n\nHe then addresses the key deficiency in Grotius\u2019 theory of\nterritory: he proposes a scope limitation on possession, which limits\nthe amount possessed by requiring that it be justified from a global\nperspective. Risse\u2019s distinctive proposal is a proportionality\nprinciple to explain how much each group is entitled to. Grotius\nhimself did not endorse proportionality, but he did believe in common\nownership, combined with a right of necessity, which Risse says\nimplies the following disjunctive right: each individual has the right\n\n\n\neither to use (in the narrow sense) resources and spaces to satisfy\none\u2019s basic needs or else to live in a society that does not\ndeny one the opportunity to satisfy one\u2019s basic needs in ways in\nwhich it otherwise could have been done through original resources and\nspaces. (Risse 2014: 112)\n\n\nHow does the proportionality principle work? The idea is that\npotential migrants can be excluded from states or areas of the world\nwhere people are over-using (or using at the average level) the\nresources, but they cannot be excluded from the areas where the\nresources are \u2018under-used\u2019. This brings in a rather\ntechnical discussion of what constitutes \u2018over-use\u2019 and\n\u2018under-use\u2019, but the most consistent formulation is that\none is \u2018underusing\u2019 a territory when the ratio of a\nstate\u2019s population to the value of its natural resources is low\ncompared to the other states, and \u2018over-using\u2019 it when the\nration is high (see Blake & Risse 2008; Risse 2012:\n158\u2013166).\n\nCritics of this view allege that there is a very basic difficulty with\nthe proportionality principle, which is that it is insensitive to the\nmyriad ways in which people interact with place, which ought to be\nrelevant to a theory of territorial justice. It relies on a\nhomogeneous and undifferentiated view of resources as existing in the\nworld, and thereby raising property and distributive justice\nquestions. This treats \u2018resources\u2019 as equivalent to\nnatural things which can be brought under an ownership relation. Both\nKolers (2009) and Moore (2012, 2015) have argued that the concept of\n\u2018resource\u2019 does not refer to a natural kind, but contains\nan important relational element, such that something gets transformed\nfrom being part of the natural world to a resource by being viewed\ninstrumentally and that this relational character is part of how we\nindividuate resources and distinguish resources from things in the\nphysical world that are not resources. This means that what counts as\na resource is historically, culturally and individually variable.\nSomething can be a resource for one person or one group, because\ninstrumental to the satisfaction of his or her purposes or needs, but\nnot a resource for someone else, because that person does not view the\nobject instrumentally. For example, the Lakota Sioux believe that the\nBlack Hills are sacred, which means that they don\u2019t view them\ninstrumentally. When in 1980, they won a U.S. Supreme Court award,\ncompensating them for the unlawful taking of Sioux lands, they\nrejected the award: they didn\u2019t want compensation; they wanted\nthe mining stopped. This highlights the problem with the\nproportionality principle and common ownership: it is biased towards\nintensive uses relative to population. It wrongly assumes that we view\nall things in the natural world from the same instrumental\nperspective, such that the ideas of trade-offs, compensation and\nuse-value are obviously applicable and neutral terms to use. What is\nneeded, critics allege, is a set of principles to adjudicate\nterritorial claims that better respect cultural variability with\nrespect to land.\n\nCara Nine has also updated the natural law tradition, focusing on\nSamuel Pufendorf\u2019s theory. In a series of well-known articles\nand her 2012 book, she relied on a particular interpretation of\nLockean arguments, but more recently she has argued that\nPufendorf\u2019s natural law/ common ownership argument is\ninstructive for our thinking about what we now think of as the global\ncommons. She examines the ocean as a common pool resource and the test\ncase of rival claims in Arctic waters (Nine 2019). She argues that\nPufendorf\u2019s appeal to conventional agreements and a system of\ncollective dominium may be the best way for assessing whether there is\nreal benefit from exclusive use of an object (thereby potentially\ngiving rise to property claims) and the role of necessity in\nadjudicating between rival claims. Nine argues that Pufendorf\u2019s\nmore social, conventional and collective account of our relations to\nthe world contains a discussion of inherent limits of jurisdictional\ncontrol. The claims to common pool resources, are, she argues, limited\nin three ways: the need to avoid domination among claimants, thus\nsetting the stage for a deliberation amongst claimants from a position\nof equal status; avoiding greed,; and avoiding taking what is already\nused by others, which implies a recognition of the needs, commitments\nand expectations of others (see also Mancilla 2012). Although this is\nnot presented as a full territorial theory, it does indicate the rich\nnuances of some exponents of that tradition and the way that the\nconcepts they deployed can be serviceable to contemporary problems. It\nalso points to a conventional account of the limits of such rights,\nwhere the conventions have to be sensitive to the equal standing of\nparties, and their needs and commitments. Nine then usefully discusses\nhow this could be applied to places that we think of as part of the\nglobal commons as well as its implications for a hybrid (conventional\ncombined with moral principles) theory of boundaries.\n",
