    "preamble": "\n\nSex has received little attention in the history of western\nphilosophy, and what it did receive was not good: Plato denigrated it,\narguing that it should lead to something higher or better\n(Phaedrus, Symposium), Aristotle barely mentioned\nit, and Christian philosophers condemned it: Augustine argued that its\npleasures are dangerous in mastering us, and allowed sex only for\nprocreation (City of God, bk 14; On Marriage and\nConcupiscence), while Aquinas confined its permissibility to\nconjugal, procreative acts (Summa contra gentiles III.2;\nSumma theologica IIa\u2013IIae). Immanuel Kant (Lectures\non Ethics) considered it the only inclination that cannot satisfy\nthe Categorical Imperative, and Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that sexual\ndesire aims to capture the other\u2019s freedom (1943: pt. III, ch.\n3]). The Marquis de Sade (a philosopher of sorts) went to the opposite\nextreme, celebrating all types of sexual acts, including rape (1785;\n1791; 1795). Only during contemporary times do philosophers, beginning\nwith Bertrand Russell (1929) and including Sigmund Freud (1905), think\nof sex as generally good (see Soble 2006b and 2008, ch. 2 for this\nhistory; Belliotti 1993, Pt.

    "main_text": "\n1. Conceptual Issues\n1.1 Sexual Desire\n\nThe concept of sexual desire is a central concept in the philosophy of\nsex, one connected to other central concepts, especially sexual\nattraction, sexual pleasure, sexual motives, arousal, and sexual\nactivity (all of which make an appearance in the discussion below). It\nrefers to a biological capacity that human beings have to be attracted\nto others and to seek sexual pleasure and activity, and it refers to\nspecific instances of desiring specific people or activities (when,\ne.g., X experiences sexual desire for Y).\n\nFive broad issues are prominent regarding sexual desire: (1) whether\nit is merely a biological drive, an intentional mental state, or both;\n(2) how it should be defined; (3) whether it is benign or malignant;\n(4) whether acting on it should be morally restricted to particular\ncontexts; and (5) whether it admits of perverted forms. (Section 2\ndiscusses (4) and (5).)\n\nDefinitions of sexual desire in terms of sexual pleasure seem to\nunderstand sexual desire as basically an appetite. On one such\ndefinition, \u201csexual desire\u201d is \u201cdesire for contact\nwith another person\u2019s body and for the pleasure which such\ncontact produces\u201d (Goldman 1977, 268) or \u201csexual\ndesire\u201d is \u201cthe desire for certain bodily pleasures\u201d\n(Primoratz 1999, 46; see also Halwani 2020; Soble 1991, 139\u2013151\nand 1996, 83). Thus, if X feels sexual desire, then\nX desires the touch of another person\u2019s\n(Y\u2019s) body and the sexual pleasure derived through that\ntouch. An alternative definition avoids the conceptual involvement of\nanother person, understanding sexual desire instead as desire for\nsexual pleasures, period. This accommodates cases in which the desire\nis not for the touch of another\u2019s body: some cases of\nmasturbation, voyeurism, and exhibitionism, for example.\n\nThese views have in common the idea that sexual desire is desire for\nbrute bodily pleasures, possibly implying that sexual desire is merely\na biological appetite. If so, they face the objection that they\nmischaracterize the nature of sexual desire, which should instead be\nunderstood as intentional through and through (Morgan 2003b). That is,\nwhenever X sexually desires someone or something, X\ndoes so under a description: X desires Y because\nsomething about Y appeals to X. Even when X\ndesires anonymous sex, X desires \u201cthe pleasure of\nanonymous sex\u201d (Morgan 2003b). On the intentional view, sexual\ndesire is no mere appetite but thoroughly infused with meaning.\n\nAlthough the intentional view need not insist on the conceptual\nrequirement of another person, its most common instantiation is the\nidea that sexual desire is interpersonal\u2014that the agent\u2019s\nsexual desire always seeks fulfillment with another person, or at\nleast always ought to seek fulfillment with another person.\nInterpersonal sexual desire involves the \u201cmarshalling and\ndirecting of animal urges toward an interpersonal aim, and an\ninterpersonal fulfillment\u201d (Scruton 1986, 289) and might be\nthought to involve multiple levels of awareness: X desires\nY, desires that Y desire X, desires to be\naroused by Y\u2019s desire of X, and so on (Nagel\n1969). Some have thought it should, additionally, be directed to love\n(Scruton 1986: 339; cf. Giles 2008, ch. 3). A normative view that\nsexual desire ought to be interpersonal or interpersonal in a\nspecific way might be rejected as an account of what sexual desire\nis. To be an account of what sexual desire is, an\ninterpersonal account would need to articulate a normatively neutral\ninterpersonal view.\n\nThe pleasure view of sexual desire, however, is not committed to\nunderstanding sexual desire as mere appetite. For example, if\nX wants to masturbate, X is not being led by blind\ninstinct; X can be thinking, \u201cI look forward to\nenjoying the sensations of rubbing my clitoris with my favorite\nvibrator as I fantasize about having sex with my neighbor.\u201d In\nother words, \u201csexual desire can be focused or selective at the\nsame time as being physical\u201d (Goldman 1977, 279; Halwani 2020,\n124\u2013127).\n\nThe intentional view is plausible in that sexual desire can be quite\ncomplex and that its complexity is not captured well (or at all) by\nthe pleasure view, given that human mentality infuses our most basic\nurges and appetites. But it depends on what we want the pleasure view\nto accomplish. If it is meant to capture the \u201cessence\u201d of\nsexual desire, the two are compatible with each other; if it is meant\nas a detailed description of the depth, complexity, and variety of the\nphenomenon, the pleasure view falls short. Given that definitions are\nnot usually meant to convey the complexity of what they define, we\nshould not expect a definition of sexual desire to be a full-blown\ntheory of it, and we can agree that sexual desire is a complex\nphenomenon.\n\nThis does not mean that the pleasure view of sexual desire is correct,\nonly that its aim or strategy need not be misguided. Indeed, depending\non how it is stated, the pleasure view might be wrong. For example, if\nit conceptually ties sexual desire to sexual pleasure obtained through\nthe touch of another person, sexual desire would then be\nnecessarily interpersonal and might implausibly render many sexual\ndesires as nonsexual, such as some masturbatory desires, voyeurism,\nand exhibitionism. Furthermore, the touch of another\nperson\u2019s body implies that zoophiliac desires are\nnonsexual. Necrophiliac desires would also be nonsexual if\n\u201cperson\u201d refers to a living person. A non-interpersonal\ndefinition\u2014for sexual pleasures, period\u2014avoids such\nimplications (Soble 1991 and later editions of the essay, the last\nbeing 2013a; Halwani 2018b, ch. 5).\n\nEven a non-interpersonal pleasure view might face difficulties\nstemming from understanding desire in terms of what it seeks\n(sexual pleasure). Calling the approach that defines sexual desire in\nterms of what it seeks the \u201cobject-based strategy,\u201d\nRockney Jacobsen raises difficulties with it (2017, 30). One is\ndefining \u201csexual pleasure\u201d (see below), which the\nobject-based strategy needs to do to be complete (2017, 33). Second,\nJacobsen rejects the idea that all sexual desires are for sexual\npleasure, giving the example of a couple who has sex to have a baby,\nnot for pleasure (2017, 33; see also 1993). Third, our sexual partners\nwould in principle be dispensable if there are other ways to attain\nthe pleasure. This third objection is not moral\u2014that we use our\nsexual partners as mere instruments\u2014but ontological: sexual\npleasure cannot be the only or common goal to all sexual desires\notherwise the agent would be indifferent between the available ways of\nattaining sexual pleasure. Since this is not true, Jacobsen concludes\nthat sexual desire is not solely for sexual pleasure (2017, 33).\n\nJacobsen prefers the \u201cfeature-based\u201d approach, which\ndefines \u201csexual desire\u201d in terms of \u201csexual\narousal,\u201d which is the state of being turned on (and that we\noften find ourselves in), manifested in erections, lubricated vaginas,\nflushed faces, and \u201ctingling earlobes\u201d (Jacobsen 2017, 35;\ncf. Shaffer 1978; see also Jacobsen 2006, 226\u2013227). So when\nX sexually desires something (another person, an object, or\nan activity), X desires it because it has a feature that\nX expects to affect X\u2019s sexual arousal\n(Jacobsen 2017, 36). The feature-based strategy is supposed to be\nsuperior to the object-based one because it does not face the\nabove-mentioned three difficulties.\n\nThe feature-based view, however, might pass the buck: either\n\u201csexual arousal\u201d means what we usually mean by\n\u201csexual desire\u201d (the examples of sexual\narousal\u2014erections, lubricated vaginas\u2014might serve equally\nwell as examples of sexual desire), or it does not. If the former, we\nwould still need a definition of \u201csexual arousal,\u201d much\nlike we needed a definition of \u201csexual desire.\u201d If the\nlatter, we would need an account of what \u201csexual arousal\u201d\nis, because if it is not the same as sexual desire, what exactly is\nit? Referring back to erections and lubricated vaginas will not do,\nbecause we may ask, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they states of sexual\ndesire?\u201d So defining \u201csexual desire\u201d in\nterms of sexual arousal might be convincing only if we can understand\n\u201csexual arousal\u201d independently of \u201csexual\ndesire\u201d (Halwani 2018b, 170\u2013171).\n\nJacobsen\u2019s example of the couple having sex to procreate merits\ndiscussion. Jacobsen intends it to be a case of sexual desire but not\nfor sexual pleasure. However, the example is under-described because\nthe desire can be understood as the nonsexual desire for procreation.\nTo better address such cases, it is useful to distinguish sexual\nmotives\u2014motives to engage in an activity to experience sexual\npleasure\u2014from nonsexual motives, such as to conceive a child, to\nmake someone jealous, to exact revenge, and to pass the time. One can\nargue that if the couple in question indeed experience sexual desire\nfor the act or each other, their nonsexual motive for procreation does\nnot replace their sexual motive and can be added to it. Although\npeople can have sex from purely nonsexual motives (e.g., many cases of\nsex work), once we postulate the presence of sexual desire, the motive\nof seeking sexual pleasure is present. Motives for having sex, like\nmotives for nonsexual activities, can be mixed, involving sexual and\nnonsexual ones.\n\nOne reason for the insistence on the sexual motive in understanding\nsexual desire is that if sexual desire is partly a biological or\nphysiological state (even if in human beings it is also a mental,\nintentional state), it exerts its pull even with the presence of\nnonsexual motives (see Dent 1984, ch. 2; see also Hamilton 2001, ch.\n9; Webber 2009). Another reason is that without the motive for sexual\npleasure, the idea of sexual desire becomes so broad as to refer to\nany desire for sexual activity, with the danger of obfuscation: we\nwould have to understand a sex worker\u2019s desire for sex with a\nclient as sexual, whereas in fact it is solely financial.\n\nSexual desire\u2019s pull supports pessimist views of sexual desire.\nAlthough pessimism and optimism have moral implications \u2013 some\nof which are addressed below \u2013 they are based in how pessimism\nand optimism perceive the nature of sexual desire. Pessimists consider\nsexual desire morally dangerous and threatening to our rationality\n(including Christian philosophers such as Augustine and Thomas\nAquinas, Plato, Kant, and Schopenhauer [1859, ch. 44], and, among\ncontemporary philosophers of sex Alan Soble, whose views in\n\u201cSexual Use\u201d [2013b; 2017b; 2022c] imply with some\ncertainty that he is also a pessimist). Optimism considers sexual\ndesire as generally benign and as bringing people together (it\ncommands a large majority of the philosophers of sex, including\nBertrand Russell 1929, passim; Irving Singer 2001,\npassim; and Martha Nussbaum 1995, 1998), though it recognizes\nthat it can be morally problematic (Morgan 2003a). The issue, then,\nbetween pessimism and optimism concerns not whether sexual desire\ncan be morally problematic, but whether it is so by its\nnature (Soble, with Halwani 2017, 5\u20138).\n\nSexual pessimism can be deep. Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s version is that\nsexual desire aims to capture a person in their entirety through their\nbody. To do so, the agent must also make him or herself pure flesh by\nallowing sexual desire to \u201cclog\u201d their consciousness\n(Sartre 1943 [1956, 504]). Thus, \u201cI make myself flesh in the\npresence of the Other in order to appropriate the Other\u2019s\nflesh\u201d (Sartre 1943 [1956, 506]). Another version of deep\npessimism is Kant\u2019s, which considers sexual desire to be for the\nsexual parts or body of another person, not the person\u2019s\n\u201cwork and services\u201d (Kant 1930 [1963, 163]; see also 1797,\n6:424\u20136:427; see below the moral implications of this view).\nSexual desire sets aside another\u2019s humanity and targets their\nflesh. This does not mean that in desiring Y, X\nwould be as happy with Y\u2019s corpse or with Y\nunconscious as with Y alive (as Shrage and Stewart [2015, 6]\nclaim); for X, Y-dead is not at all equally\npreferable to Y-alive. It also does not mean that during sex\nX treats Y as an object with no desires or interests\nof Y\u2019s own. Instead, X treats those interests\nas merely instrumental to the satisfaction of X\u2019s\nsexual desires (Halwani 2018b, ch. 8; Soble 2013b, 2017b; 2022c; see\nalso Herman 1993; O\u2019Neill 1985; Papadaki 2007). A phenomenology\nof sexual desire seems to support the above views, according to which\nin sexually desiring Y, X is attracted to the\nbodily, physical attributes of Y.\n\nSexual optimists claim that although sexual desire can be morally\ndangerous, it need not be and is usually not. They agree that it\nfocuses on the body but do not see this as a problem. Sex intimately\nand pleasurably brings two (or more) people together. It is a force\nfor good, establishing trust and strengthening human bonds. Unlike\nappetites,\n\n\nsexual interest \u2026 [is] \u2026 an interpersonal\nsensitivity, one that enables us to delight in the mind and character\nof other persons as well as in their flesh\u2026 [S]ex may be seen\nas an instinctual agency by which persons respond to one another\nthrough their bodies. (Singer 1984, 382; see also Goldman\n1977, 282\u2013283; Russell 1929 [1970, passim])\n\n\nFor the optimist, Soble notes, \u201cSexual pleasure is \u2026 a\nvaluable thing in its own right, something to be cherished and\npromoted because it has intrinsic and not merely instrumental\nvalue\u201d (Soble, with Halwani 2017, 8).\n1.2 Sexual Activity\n\nIt is difficult to define \u201csexual act\u201d or \u201csexual\nactivity.\u201d Various proposed criteria face difficulties (Soble\n2006a). This is especially so when closely related concepts (e.g.,\n\u201chaving sex\u201d) do not have the same extension. In ordinary\nlanguage use, and according to some studies, people distinguish\nbetween having sex and sexual activity; they count many activities as\nsexual but not as having sex, such as solo masturbation, cyber-sex,\nand even oral sex (Soble 2006a,: 15\u201316). Solo masturbation\ncounts as sexual activity and as a sexual act, but not as having sex,\nthough Soble has recently argued that solo masturbation is on a\ncontinuum with other forms of sexual activity, both physically and\npsychologically (2022a). There are a few criteria to define\n\u201csexual activity\u201d (Soble 2006a). One criterion is\nreproduction: for an activity to be sexual it has to be or aim at\nbeing reproductive. This faces obvious counter-examples, such as\nsame-sex sexual activities and heterosexual oral and anal sex (Soble\n2006a, 18\u201319). Another criterion is bodily contact: sexual\nactivities are those that involve contact with sexual body parts\n(though we need to figure out what these parts are). This fails as a\nsufficient condition (doctors sometimes have to touch patients\u2019\ngenitals) and as a necessary one (achieving orgasm during a phone-sex\nchat) (Soble 2006a, 19\u201320).\n\nSexual pleasure is a third criterion: \u201cThose activities \u2026\nare sexual \u2026 which give rise to sexual pleasure\u201d (Gray\n1978, 191\u2013192). But the production of sexual pleasure is not\nnecessary because many acts do not produce such pleasure; and this\ncriterion conceptually rules out non-pleasurable sex (Soble 2006a,\n21\u201322). It might also not be sufficient: a man might see someone\non the street and feel a twinge of sexual pleasure (Soble 1996, 130).\nThe presence of sexual pleasure in this case does not suffice for the\nman\u2019s experience to be sexual activity (perhaps if the man\ncontinues to look the experience becomes a sexual activity because of\nhis intention to keep looking; Soble 1996, 130).\n\nAnother criterion is intention, though we need to figure out what the\nintention is for. One reasonable candidate is \u201cthe intention to\nproduce sexual pleasure in oneself or in another.\u201d But this is\nnot necessary: two people who have sexual intercourse to procreate\nengage in a sexual act. The experience, if any, of sexual pleasure is\na by-product of the action (Soble 1996, 132). This criterion\nis also not sufficient. Suppose that X intends to produce\nsexual pleasure in Y by \u201cwhistling\n\u2018Dixie\u2019,\u201d but what X does is not a sexual\nact (Soble 2006a, 22).\n\nAnother criterion for defining \u201csexual activity\u201d is sexual\ndesire:\n\n\nsexual desire is desire for contact with another person\u2019s body\nand for the pleasure which such contact produces; sexual activity is\nactivity which tends to fulfill such desire of the agent. (Goldman\n1977, 268)\n\n\nA \u201csexual act\u201d (or \u201cactivity\u201d, in\nGoldman\u2019s terms) is activity \u201cwhich tends to\nfulfill\u201d sexual desire.\n\nThe definition sounds right: what else is a sexual act if not\none that satisfies or \u201ctends to\u201d satisfy sexual desire?\nBut it faces counter-examples. Consider a sex worker performing\nfellatio on a man: while fellatio fulfills or tends to fulfill the\nman\u2019s sexual desire, it does not fulfill or tend to fulfill the\nsex worker\u2019s sexual desire if she does not desire the client (as\nis often the case). Thus satisfying sexual desire is not necessary for\nan activity to be sexual. Whether it is sufficient depends on what we\nmean by \u201csatisfaction\u201d or \u201cfulfillment.\u201d If it\nmeans \u201cthe desire is no longer felt for the time being\u201d or\n\u201cthe desire is gone,\u201d satisfying sexual desire would\nnot be sufficient. Taking a cold shower, a powerful sleeping\npill, or even focusing on something else might get rid of the sexual\ndesire, yet these activities are not sexual. If \u201csatisfying\nsexual desire\u201d means, \u201cthe desire achieves its goal\u201d\n(which is sexual fulfillment), satisfying sexual desire by a\nparticular activity would be sufficient for that activity to\nbe sexual, but the definition becomes circular. The criterion of\nsexual desire, then, does not succeed in defining \u201csexual\nact\u201d.\n\nBy the above criteria, a definition of \u201csexual activity\u201d\nis hard to find. One crucial reason might be that what we commonly\nthink is a sexual act does not depend on one criterion: behavior,\nintentions, contact with specific body parts, etc., play a role\ndepending on the context. This reason motivates a disjunctive\ndefinition, according to which an activity is sexual if and only if it\nis done from a sexual motive, it tends to fulfill sexual desire, it\ninvolves contact with the genitalia (or sexual body parts) or one or\nmore of the parties to the activity, or it behaviorally fits\nparadigmatic cases of sexual activity (this is just one example of a\ndisjunctive definition). Whether such a definition succeeds depends on\nvarious factors, such as that each disjunct is itself philosophically\nunproblematic, the list of disjuncts is exhaustive, and the definition\nis not too unwieldy to be plausible or useful.\n\nAnother reason why a definition of sexual activity is hard to find\n(and one that might go against a disjunctive definition) is that there\nare many concepts closely related to each other that nonetheless\ncommonly mean different things. \u201cTo have sex\u201d or \u201cto\nengage in sex\u201d almost always refer to sexual activity with at\nleast one more person, whereas \u201cengaging in a sexual\nactivity\u201d and \u201chaving a sexual experience\u201d do not\nhave this reference, and they are not common expressions. Thus,\ndefining these concepts is tricky if we want the definitions to agree\nwith common linguistic usage, or if we rely on such usage to formulate\nthese definitions. More worrisome, if we need to define these concepts\nfor help with practical, moral, and legal issues, the rift between\nthem and common language should give us pause.\n1.3 Sexual Pleasure\n\n\u201cPleasure\u201d refers to various phenomena: (a) physical\nsensations, with specific bodily locations (e.g., scratching an itch);\n(b) enjoyment, as when one takes pleasure in solving a jigsaw puzzle\nor lying under the sun (enjoyment does not have a specific bodily\nlocation, though the same phenomenon can be experienced as sensation\nand as enjoyment (e.g., lying under the sun); (c) a \u201cpure\u201d\nfeeling that is felt all over but has no specific bodily location, and\nthat need not be focused on a particular activity, such as being\nelated (Goldman 2016, 88); and (d) an attitude, to be \u201cpleased\nat something\u201d; the belief that what one is pleased at is good\n(Goldman 2016, 83\u201390).\n\nWe thus have four types of pleasure: pleasure-as-sensation,\npleasure-as-enjoyment, pleasure-as-feeling, and\npleasure-as-pro-attitude. All four concepts can be relevant to sex,\nbut the first two are especially important, because each can be a type\nof sexual pleasure, whereas the third is typically consequent to\nsexual activity and the fourth is an attitude about sex. (a) The\npleasure of orgasm is an obvious example of the first, and (b)\nenjoying sexual activity is a usual experience that people undergo.\n(c) One can experience elation because of having had great sex, and\n(d) one can feel pleased at that (Halwani 2020, 111\u2013122).\n\nMoreover, one or more parties to the act might experience\npleasure-as-sensation, yet not enjoy the activity itself ((a) and\n(b)). One can experience the pleasurable sensations of sex and enjoy\nthe act, yet feel repulsion at the act later and be displeased with\noneself at having engaged in the act ((c) and (d)). We can also see\nhow each pleasure has its opposite when it comes to sex: one can feel\npainful sensations during sex (e.g., anal penetration), one can endure\na sexual act (not enjoy it), one can feel nausea at what one has done\nsexually, and one can have a negative attitude at one\u2019s sexual\nactivity.\n\nAlthough orgasm does not exhaust the pleasures of sex, there is\nsomething to the idea that the pleasure of orgasm is unique. As a\nsensation, it is unique in the way it feels and in its intensity,\nthough this feeling might differ between men and women, especially\nsince women seem to experience various types of orgasm (Meston et al.\n2004, 174\u2013176; but see Wallen and Lloyd 2011, 780\u2013783).\nMoreover, it contrasts with other sensation-pleasures in its\nphysiological aspects and ability to be produced through genital\nstimulation. For example, the sensation of having one\u2019s ear\nlicked is not as such a pleasure and depends on whom one\nthinks is licking it. But the sensation of orgasm is not like this,\nwhich makes orgasm a pleasure that cuts across social layers, a bodily\nsensation unmediated by social meanings or concepts; \u201cthe trait\nof female orgasm [is] a physiological trait or reflex, not a social\ntrait\u201d (Lloyd 2005, 48). Of course its frequency, significance,\nand meaning vary socially, culturally, and contextually (Blair et al.\n2017; Janssen 2007; Mah and Binik 2002). This feature of orgasm might\nexplain how we can speak of sexual desire across times and cultures as\na unified phenomenon, even though sexual desires and bodily sensations\nare socially and linguistically mediated.\n\nIf the pleasure of orgasm is unique, why do people usually prefer sex\nwith someone else to masturbating, given that masturbating produces\norgasms, often more intense than partnered sex? This shows that orgasm\nis not the only pleasure sought in sexual activity, not that its\npleasure is not unique. Touching, smelling, kissing, and licking, for\nexample, are other goals of sexual desire (Soble 1996, 85\u201386).\nWe can even claim that people prefer the pleasure of orgasm\nthrough the other goals just mentioned.\n\nThe discussion of sexual pleasure is important in itself and, as we\nhave seen, for understanding \u201csexual desire.\u201d For example,\naccording to Igor Primoratz, \u201csexual desire is sufficiently\ndefined as the desire for certain bodily pleasures, period\u201d\n(1999, 46). But which bodily pleasures? One answer is\npleasure-as-sensation: those \u201cexperienced in the sexual parts of\nthe body, i.e., the genitals and other parts that differentiate the\nsexes\u201d (Primoratz 1999, 46). More generally, and accounting for\nsexual pleasures not located in the genitals, sexual pleasure\n\n\nis the sort of bodily pleasure experienced in the sexual parts of the\nbody, or at least related to those parts in that if it is associated\nwith arousal, the arousal occurs in those parts. (Primoratz 1999,\n46)\n\n\nTo distinguish a sexual from a nonsexual kiss, we ask which of the two\nis associated with arousal, and we understand the notion of arousal as\nessentially linked to the sexual body parts.\n\nBecause the above view relies solely on sexual pleasure-as-sensation,\nit would have to understand the other two types ultimately in terms of\npleasure-as-sensation. That is, what makes sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment sexual is its connection to arousal.\nThis implies that \u201csensory pleasure is more fundamental when it\ncomes to sex\u201d (Goldman 2016, 95).\n\nIn most activities, the pleasure and the activity are\nintertwined\u2014we do not watch a movie and then feel the pleasure.\nInstead, we enjoy the movie as we watch it. The pleasures here are\npleasures-as-enjoyment. Things are different with sex because of\npleasure-as-sensation, specifically, orgasm. Sexual\npleasure-as-enjoyment supervenes on sexual pleasure-as-sensation, and\nit often culminates in orgasm, a result that comes at the end of the\nactivity (though the orgasm as an end differs between men and women).\nWe can then see why some prominent philosophers have considered\ntemperance and intemperance to be about bodily appetites satisfied\nespecially through touch (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics\n1118a\u20131118b).\n\nSexual pleasures-as-enjoyment and as-feeling might thus be parasitic\non sexual pleasures-as-sensations. The butterflies one feels in\none\u2019s stomach at the prospect of sex exist because of the\nexpectation of sensual pleasure, and so does enjoying a sexual act.\nSexual pleasure, especially as-sensation, stands out as a crucial\nmotivation for having sex, and its concept supplies us with a good way\nof defining \u201csexual desire.\u201d\n\nSexual pleasure need not be the primary motive for sexual activity,\nand people have sex for various reasons. Cindy Meston and David Buss\nidentify 237 expressed reasons for why people have sex (though in a\nfew cases they count the same reason more than once), including, in\naddition to sexual pleasure, finding the other person attractive,\nexpressing love, feeling desired by the other, deepening the\nrelationship, and trying new experiences (2007, 480). They are silent\non how many of the nonsexual motives are mingled with the motive for\nsexual pleasure. This question is important because it gets to the\nissue of how primary the sexual motive is in having sex, given that\nnot being attracted to one\u2019s potential sexual partner, even\nbeing repulsed by them, might be powerful enough to trump other\nreasons for wanting sex (people might not have sex just to\nexercise, to boost their self-image, etc.).\n1.4 Sexual Preferences and Orientation\n\nSexual orientation is commonly understood as a person\u2019s standing\nsexual preference for men, women, or both. It is a basic preference,\nunlike, say, the preference for hair color or buttock size. It is also\nan organizing preference: other sexual preferences are built upon it\n(Stein 1999, ch. 2). A foot fetishist is either gay, straight or\nbisexual, before he is a foot fetishist, though it is an empirical\nquestion whether there can be sexual orientations for body parts (or\nobjects) regardless of the gender or sex of the person\u2019s body\npart (Stein 1999, ch. 2; Wilkerson 2013). It is unclear, however, how\nto distinguish orientations from mere preferences; saying that the\nformer are basic whereas the latter are not seems to merely reflect\ncommon views of the distinction (Dembroff 2016, 12; Stock 2019, 315).\nHalwani (forthcoming) argues that, given the importance we attach to\norientations, it is a necessary condition for a sexual desire to be an\norientation that its fulfillment is needed for the well-being of the\nperson with the desire, whereas preferences are not tied to well-being\nin such strong ways.\n\nMere sexual preferences vary tremendously, targeting people, objects,\nactivities, and sexual positions, probably because they are a function\nof the person\u2019s individual history and the available social and\ncultural options (on this variety, see Love 1992). Some preferences\nare considered perverted (e.g., coprophilia), some immoral (e.g.,\npedophilia), and some both. Yet with others it is not so obvious, such\nas sexual preferences for members of particular races or ethnic\ngroups. Perhaps X\u2019s preference for Asian women is\ninnocent, on a par with the preference for tall people. But it might\nalso indicate an ethical fault if, say, racially ugly stereotypes\ninform it (Barn 2022; Halwani 2017b [2022]; Kershnar 2019; Zheng\n2016).\n\nReturning to sexual orientation, some philosophers have claimed that\nits popular conception relies on dubious assumptions (Corvino 2006a;\nDembroff 2016).\n\n(1)\nIt assumes three basic orientations: homosexual, heterosexual, and\nbisexual (or only two if one thinks, as does Kathleen Stock, that\nbisexuality is not a third orientation but an amalgam of the other\ntwo, such that bisexuals have two sexual orientations, heterosexuality\nand homosexuality [2019, 298\u2013300]).\n(2)\nIt includes the gender or sex of the person who has the\norientation as an essential element of the orientation;\nX\u2019s being gay means that X has the same\nsex/gender as the target of the orientation.\n(3)\nIt is ambiguous between sex and gender: is a straight man\nattracted to the gender or the sex of women? And is the man straight\nbecause of his gender or sex?\n(4)\nIt assumes a binary of gender/sex for both parties, excluding\npeople who exist outside the binary.\n(5)\nIt is ambiguous between sexual and emotional attraction: if a man\nis emotionally attracted to other men, does that mean that he is gay\nor something else?\n(6)\nIt is silent on what counts as the basic components of the\norientation: is it behavior, desires, or fantasies?\n(7)\nFinally, it assumes the cross-temporal and cross-cultural\nexistence of the three sexual orientations: there were gay men and gay\nwomen in 15th century Russia just as there were in\n21st century North America, albeit with adjustment for\ncultural variances.\n\n\n(1) Is there a good reason to believe that there are only three sexual\norientations? Some men are attracted to people with female features\nfrom the waist up but male features from the waist down (a penis),\nthus not easily accommodated by the above three-way division of sexual\norientations. It is also unclear whether the many men who are\nattracted to both young boys and women\u2014this is true of many\ncultures around the world, past and present\u2014are bisexual. It is\nalso possible that there are age- and species-orientations, such as\npedophilia and zoophilia. Such potential orientations threaten to\nseriously expand the number of sexual orientations (consider that\ngenuine zoophiles\u2014people who have long-standing desires to have\nsex with nonhuman animals\u2014will have as many sexual orientations\nas there are different types of animals to which they are attracted\n(Wilkerson 2013)). Whether we can maintain that there are only three\n(or two) sexual orientations depends on the answers to these questions\nand our tolerance for exceptions to the three. It also depends on the\nreasons for classifying people by sexual orientation (see Andler 2020;\nDembroff 2016; Stock 2019).\n\n(2) It is unclear why the gender/sex of the person with the\norientation should be a component of the conception of sexual\norientation. Under the popular conception, if a formerly straight man\nis currently a woman (after transitioning), they would now be a\nlesbian (assuming that their sexual desires for women does not\nchange). But if we omit the person\u2019s own gender from the\nconception, the person\u2019s sexual orientation remains the same.\nPerhaps the answer to this issue depends on the political and moral\ngains reaped by conceiving of sexual orientation in one or the other\nway (Dembroff 2016; Stock 2019, 307\u2013313).\n\n(3) The lack of distinction between sex and gender makes it hard to\nclassify cases such as this: X is attracted to Y who\nis anatomically male (sex) but who self-presents as a woman (gender).\nAssume that X\u2019s own gender and sex are male. Then,\nwhether we claim that X is gay or is straight, we face\nobstacles: if X is gay, X would not be attracted to\nsomeone who appears as a woman. If X is straight, X\nwould not be attracted to someone who is anatomically male. The\npopular concept of orientation leaves such cases unclassified (Corvino\n2006a; Wilkerson 2013; but see Stock 2019, 303\u2013307 for a way to\naccommodate gender attractions on the sex-based account of sexual\norientations). The difficulty of such cases has led some philosophers\nto include both sex and gender as the bases of sexual orientation\n(Diamond 2022; Dembroff 2016). Perhaps the distinction between\norientations and preferences is relevant here, such that gender-based\nattractions might be considered preferences, whereas sex-based\nattractions are orientations (or vice versa).\n\n(4) Connected to the previous point is that the popular understanding\nof sexual orientation assumes a binary conception of sex/gender,\nalbeit one that can include trans people. A straight woman is a woman,\ncis or trans, who is attracted to men, cis or trans (a cisperson is\nsomeone whose gender identity\u2014e.g., being a man\u2014matches\ntheir biological sex\u2014being male). Thus, there is no room for\npeople who are gender fluid or whose gender or sex identification\nexists outside the binary (Dembroff 2016).\n\n(5) Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Human\nRights Campaign understand \u201csexual orientation\u201d as\nincluding emotional attraction. The former\u2019s definition\nstates,\n\n\nSexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of emotional,\nromantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes.\n(American Psychological Association, Introduction to \u201cSexual\nOrientation and Homosexuality\u201d, Other Internet Resources)\n\n\nThus, the APA believes that a man would be straight were he to be\nemotionally (even if neither romantically nor sexually) attracted to a\nwoman. Yet it is possible that he is nonetheless sexually attracted to\nmen, a result that leads to conceptual trouble. Perhaps keeping the\nconception of sexual orientation limited to sexual attraction\nso as to avoid such trouble is better (though adding romantic\nattractions is plausible, given that they usually include a sexual\ndimension) (Dembroff 2016).\n\n(6) The popular conception of sexual orientation is not so crude as to\nrely solely on behavior, but it is silent about on what we should\nrely. Desires and fantasies are obvious candidates. But occurrent\ndesires are not a good guide to sexual orientation: a shepherd can\nsexually desire sex with a sheep, but he need not be a zoophile, even\nwere his desire for the sheep to recur. David\u2014a straight\nguy\u2014might desire oral sex from another man (Tom) or other men.\nRecourse to \u201cenduring desires,\u201d as in the APA\u2019s\ndefinition, might not do the trick if the conditions under which David\ndesires oral sex from other men recur. Other information, such as\ncounter-factual information as to what the person would do under\nsuch-and-such conditions (e.g., Stein\u2019s \u201cideal\nconditions\u201d; 1999, ch. 2), is needed\u2014if David prefers a\nwoman\u2019s mouth under ideal conditions, then he is straight. But\nstating these conditions is tough. What if David prefers the way that\nTom performs oral sex? David might, under some conditions, still opt\nfor Tom (Corvino 2006a; cf. D\u00edaz-Le\u00f3n, 2022).\n\nPerhaps fantasies are a better guide if there is a good way to\ndistinguish between fantasies that indicate the person\u2019s sexual\norientation and those that don\u2019t (after all, David\u2019s\ndesire for Tom is a fantasy of sorts; Storms 1980). This might push us\nto ideal conditions again, to distinguish between someone\u2019s real\nand \u201cfake\u201d fantasies. Or we might rely on initial sexual\nimpulses: what sexually catches the eye of someone, without much\nthought: David does desire Tom\u2019s oral skills, but what captures\nDavid\u2019s sexual eye are women, not men.\n\n(7) Philosophers and historians of sex are roughly divided into social\nconstructionists and essentialists. Weak social constructionism claims\nthat the concepts of \u201chomosexuality,\u201d\n\u201cheterosexuality,\u201d \u201cnatural sexuality,\u201d and\nsimilar concepts are limited to a specific time period and\ngeographical region. This version is weak because it is only concerned\nwith how sexuality is conceptualized: there might have been\nhomosexuals in ancient Greece, but the ancient Greeks did not think\nabout them using the concept \u201chomosexual.\u201d Strong social\nconstructionism\u2014more in line with Michel Foucault\u2019s views\n(1976)\u2014claims that the very existence of homosexual and\nheterosexual orientations is geographically and temporally limited;\nour concepts of \u201chomosexual\u201d and\n\u201cheterosexual\u201d do not refer to anything when used to refer\nto other times and regions. Essentialists claim that homosexuals,\nheterosexuals, and bisexuals have existed in various times and\ncultures (see Card 1995, ch. 3; Corvino 1997, pt. III; Corvino 2006b;\nDe Cecco 1981; Mohr 1992, ch. 7; Stein 1992, 1999, ch. 4; Wilkerson\n2013).\n\nEssentialism has difficulty accounting for the historical and cultural\nevidence: Were all the ancient Athenians who had sex with boys and\nwomen bisexuals? Possibly, but then why, in such social\nconfigurations, do we find a preponderance of bisexual men? If they\nwere not all bisexuals, what were they? Neither\n\u201chomosexual\u201d nor \u201cheterosexual\u201d seems\nadequate. Perhaps then such men had an altogether different sexual\norientation. Perhaps one option is to argue that most Athenian men\nwere bisexuals, and their preponderance can be explained by the lack\nof social strictures that most people be straight, and their\npreferences for male youths, as opposed to male adults, can be\nexplained by another set of social strictures, namely, that men should\nbe sexually attracted to femininity. This explanation renders\nessentialism intact while allowing for a robust role for social\nfactors to shape sexual desires. Related to this, essentialism has to\nbe universally true for it to be true at all, for if it excludes some\ncultures and times, it concedes the truth of social constructionism.\nBut if true of every single culture, it would be a very strong thesis,\nand the need for evidence becomes more urgent. Perhaps, then, some\nversion of social constructionism is true. Our sexual desires are\nbiologically rigid enough to target mostly members of our species, but\nnot so rigid as to reflect only our three basic sexual orientations,\nthough social constructionism would have to properly accommodate\nevolutionary biology\u2019s \u201cdesigning\u201d us for\nprocreation (Halperin 1990, ch.1).\n\nPhilosophers have only recently shown increased interest in asexuality\nand asexuals, even though non-philosophers had already started to\naddress it (Bogaert 2012, 2015). Asexuals are not sexually attracted\nto others (they are thus not to be confused with incels, who are\nsexually attracted to others). According to Anthony Bogaert, this does\nnot mean that they do not experience sexual desires, do not engage in\nsexual activity, or do not experience romance (see also Brunning and\nMcKeever 2021; Eaton and Szustak 2022). Asexuals experience sexual\ndesire and arousal because sexual desire is physiological and its\n(successful) satisfaction can yield physical pleasure (Bogaert 2012,\n21, 74). They also sometimes masturbate for the sheer pleasure of it\nor to release tension, including while fantasizing, though the\nfantasies are disconnected from the asexual person who is fantasizing:\nthey \u201cview themselves as not being part of the sexual acts they\nare fantasizing about or viewing\u201d (Bogaert 2012, 63).\n\nLuke Brunning and Natasha McKeever accept the basics of\nBogaert\u2019s view; they understand attraction as an\n\u201cinvoluntary way of being inclined toward things around\nus\u201d (2021, 499). So to be sexually attracted to others is to\nexperience them as \u201c\u2018inviting\u2019 certain forms of\nsexual engagement\u201d (2021, 499). Asexuals, then, do not\nexperience other people as sexually \u201cinviting.\u201d\nUnderstanding asexuality as lack of sexual attraction, not as lack of\nsexual desire or capacity to experience sexual pleasure, coheres with\nthe above understanding of sexual desire as seeking pleasure, except\nthat in the case of asexuals, feeling sexual desire is not triggered\nby sexual attraction (to anyone). It raises, however, the issue of the\naptness of using the label \u201casexual\u201d to refer to people\nwho can experience sexual desire and pleasure. Bogaert argues that\nunderstanding asexuality in terms of (lack of) attraction helps us see\nit as a sexual orientation and it better explains the type of people\nunder consideration\u2014that is, as a type of person, asexuals\nexperience lack of sexual attraction, not lack of sexual desire (2012,\n22).\n\nWhether asexuality is a sexual orientation is a complex issue. Stock\nclaims that asexuality is not an orientation but an absence of one\n(2019, 300). Others argue that if orientations are patterns of\nattraction, asexuality is an orientation in that asexuals also evince\na pattern. Moreover, their lack of sexual attraction is stable and\nidentity conferring, which seems to assimilate it to an orientation\n(Brunning and McKeever 2021, 4). But the claim that asexuality is an\norientation relies mostly on political and moral reasons, in that\nthinking of it as an orientation might secure asexuals social and\nlegal protections (Brunning and McKeever 2021, 4; Eaton and Szustak\n2022, 134).\n1.5 Sexual Identity\n\nThe concept of \u201cidentity\u201d is a philosophical minefield:\nidentity can be descriptive or normative; public or personal; with\nexplanatory power or inert. The distinction between first person and\nthird person attributions of identity helps us see this. When Amy\nasserts that she is gay, she could be describing herself (informing\nsomeone of who she is); she could be asserting a political or cultural\nposition, especially if the identity in question is threatened by the\npowers that be (\u201cI am gay,\u201d uttered as a way of resisting\noppression); or she could be making sense of herself, either to\nherself or to others: \u201cI am gay\u201d helps Amy see herself or\nothers see her more coherently. Third parties can make the same\nassertion about Amy in any of these ways.\n\nThe second and third ways are interesting because they allow both\nchoice with respect to the identity and disagreement about its\nassertion. Amy can choose to adopt, be indifferent to, or reject the\nidentity of being gay, and she can choose to use it (or not) to make\nsense of herself. She might fail to identify with her homosexuality\nbecause it is not important to her, because she does not find gay\ncultural ways appealing, because she does not think highly of gays,\nbecause she is ashamed, because she is religious, etc. This allows for\nhealthy disagreements with Amy\u2019s decisions. And Marcia, a\nstraight woman, might be wrong to assert her straight identity in a\nclimate in which gay people are oppressed, much like a person might be\nwrong to assert his white identity in a racist society, also allowing\nfor disagreements with her (see Alcoff 2006, esp. pt. I; Andler 2021;\nAppiah 2005, ch. 3; Halwani 2006; Lance & Tanesini 2000; Ozturk\n2017; Wilkerson 2007). In this way, it becomes an interesting\nquestion\u2014albeit one that goes against everyday\nusage\u2014whether one can be heterosexual and gay or homosexual and\nstraight. Perhaps not, if being homosexual is necessary (but not\nsufficient) for being gay, and if being heterosexual is necessary (but\nnot sufficient) for being straight.\n\nMatthew Andler has recently argued, by trying to eliminate rival\naccounts, for a \u201ccultural theory of queer sexual\nidentity.\u201d (\u201cQueer\u201d is an unclear concept, but in\nthe hands of academics it generally means any gender identity, sexual\norientation, or sexual identity that diverges, especially\nintentionally, from cisheterosexist ways of thinking and living; see\nHall 2017 for discussion.) According to Andler, one has a queer sexual\nidentity \u201cin virtue of (i) being excluded from straight culture\nand (ii) being such that according to the constitutive norms of queer\nculture the individual ought to be included in queer culture\u201d\n(2022, 124). Whether such an account succeeds depends on whether other\naccounts have been successfully argued against. It also depends on how\nmonolithic and rigid we take such cultures to be, and so which of\ntheir aspects are exclusionary and which are not. Moreover, this\naccount implies that there are no queer identities in those possible\nworlds in which gay and straight people exist but in which\nheterosexual cultures do not exclude queer people. It seems plausible\nthat in such worlds there are queer identities (though\n\u201cqueer\u201d would not have the same oppositional meaning as it\ndoes in the actual world).\n\nThe notion of sexual identity might help address the desired goals\nbehind the claim that asexuality is a sexual orientation, for one can\nargue that even if asexuality is not an orientation, asexuals still\nhave a sexual identity, and it is their identity that supports calls\nfor their social and legal protections.\n2. Normative Issues\n2.1 Good and Bad Sex\n\n\u201cGood sex\u201d and \u201cbad sex\u201d can refer to\npleasurable as well as to morally, aesthetically, practically, and\nlegally good or bad sex and to natural and unnatural sex (Soble 2008,\n85\u201387; Soble, with Halwani 2017, 8\u201316).\n\nIt is unclear what aesthetic sex is (it is in need of philosophical\nexploration), but applying some common aesthetic concepts, such as\n\u201cunity\u201d, \u201ccoherence\u201d, and\n\u201ccompleteness\u201d\u2014concepts used in defining the\naesthetic experience (Beardsley 1982, chs. 1, 5, 16; cf. Levine 2006;\nSinger 2001, ch. 5)\u2014might be useful: a sexual act can be\ncoherent, unified, and fulfills the parties\u2019 expectations (this\nis Monroe Beardsley\u2019s view of completeness; 1982, 85\u201386).\nAssuming these three are the only components of aesthetic experiences,\nsexual activity can provide an aesthetic experience to its\nparticipants. Other concepts, such as \u201cbeauty\u201d and its\nopposites (e.g., \u201cdullness\u201d, \u201cmonotony\u201d,\n\u201cthe disgusting\u201d, \u201cthe insipid\u201d) can also be\nrelevant, though whether they retain their aesthetic sense when\napplied to sex is the question. This last point is as true, if not\nmore, of \u201cpleasure\u201d: Is there such a thing as aesthetic\npleasure, and can it be a property of sexual acts? (Shusterman 2021\nprovides historical in-depth treatment of the relationship between sex\nand aesthetics).\n\nSex can also be practically or pragmatically good or bad: a\n\u201csexting\u201d politician can ruin his career, unprotected\nsexual intercourse risks contracting HIV, sex without contraception\nrisks (undesired) pregnancy, and public sex risks arrest. Practically\ngood sex does not lead to bad results and might have positive\noutcomes: a sense of rejuvenation, loss of calories, or a wanted\npregnancy.\n\n\u201cGood sex\u201d most obviously refers to pleasurable sex. A sex\nact can be good or bad depending on the amount and intensity of the\npleasure or pain it provides (Vannoy 1980, ch. 3), though pain in sex\ncan contribute to its pleasure (e.g., in bondage and sadomasochism).\nWe must keep in mind the different senses of \u201cpleasure\u201d\nthat can come into play, especially pleasure-as-sensation and\npleasure-as-enjoyment.\n2.2 Sex and Morality\n\nSexual activity is either morally permissible or impermissible.\nNatural Law philosophers (whose stance can be aptly described as\nconservative) think that sexual acts are permissible only in\nparticular contexts, especially in marital or love relationships. Many\ntake their cue from Aristotle and Aquinas to argue that our bodily\norgans have a telos that dictates to what ends we should pursue sexual\nactivity. Edward Feser (2015), for example, defends \u201cthe\nperverted faculty argument,\u201d according to which to flourish we\nmust follow the procreative ends of our sexual organs, which include\nnot only begetting children but also raising them to adulthood. Human\nbeings who, for example, fornicate or have same-sex sex pervert this\nfaculty. More recently, Feser (2022) has argued that advocates of his\nposition of teleological essentialism approach sexual ethics from\nmetaphysical bases so different from those of liberal philosophers\nthat they are talking past one another.\n\nOther Natural Law philosophers argue that our sexual organs must form\na unity of the two partners in a way compatible with the end of\nprocreation (see Finnis 1993, 2011; George 2003; George & Bradley\n1995; Hsiao 2015; Lee & George 1997; Pruss 2000, 2012). The main\nreasons are the theory\u2019s view of marriage, which, following\nThomas Aquinas, is understood as a basic good, and its view of marital\nsexual acts as reproductive and unitive, as two-in-one flesh\ncommunions. Only marital sex\u2014i.e., sex acts between married\npartners who do it from the specific motive of the good of\nmarriage (what this means, though, is unclear)\u2014is considered\nmorally permissible, even good. Thus, although consent to the sexual\nact is necessary, it is not sufficient: the sex has to be done from\nthe motive of marital unity.\n\nThree prominent objections to the above Natural Law views are (1) that\nthe view of marriage is both undefended and implausible; (2) that the\nconnection between reproduction or biological two-in-one union and the\nmorality of sex is unclear, and (3) that it is unclear why other\ngoods, such as sexual pleasure, are ruled out as basic goods\n(Koppelman 2008; see also Biggar & Black 2000). Recently, Kurt\nBlankschaen (2020) has argued that Natural Law has the internal\nresources to not condemn same-sex sex because we can view the unitive\naspect of sex as a genus with various species, one of which is\nprocreation, much like the genus of tree bark is to protect trees, but\nsuch that some do so by photosynthesis while others do not.\n\nMarriage need not be the only context to which sex ought to be\nconfined. Non-Natural Law philosophers have considered love to be such\na context (most importantly Roger Scruton 1986). A view confining sex\nto love need not insist also on only two partners to the relationship,\nor on being of different sex/gender. It requires only the presence of\nlove. Other versions require only affection or a mutually respectful\nrelationship (Hampton 1999; Nussbaum 1995). On such views, consensual\ncasual sex between two strangers is impermissible.\n\nWhy must factors such as love and a mutually respectful relationship\nbe present for the permissibility of sex? One prominent reason is that\nsex is somehow morally dangerous. Sex might make us treat our sexual\npartners as objects, and the power of sex might make us engage in sex\nwith the wrong people, in the wrong circumstances, etc. So something\nis needed to minimize or erode this danger. Love or a respectful\nrelationship minimizes these risks (Nussbaum 1995, 227\u2013231).\n\nAlan Soble, addressing Martha Nussbaum\u2019s (1995) view that\nobjectification and respect are compatible with each other, argues\nthat love or a respectful relationship does not prevent lovers or\npartners from objectifying each other during the sex (Soble\n2017b, 304\u2013309; 2022c, 406\u2013411; see below for discussion\nof objectification). Moreover, views about the ability of respect or\nlove to curb sexual objectification might be too optimistic: if sex is\nso powerful or mind-numbing, being in a relationship might not\nattenuate its power or control it effectively (e.g., partners soon\nstart eyeing people outside the relationship).\n\nThere are other normative questions besides the question of when\nsexual activity is permissible:\n\n(1)\nCan sexual activity be assessed as good or bad, not merely\npermissible or impermissible?\n(2)\nAre there sexual obligations\u2014moral obligations to engage in\nsexual activity?\n(3)\nIs sex morally special or do the same general moral rules and\nnorms that apply to nonsexual domains equally apply to sex?\n\n\nThe answer to (1) is \u201cYes.\u201d To give three examples, sexual\nacts can be done generously (e.g., paying extra sexual attention to\none\u2019s partner), caringly (e.g., expressing tenderness), or\nfairly (e.g., performing oral sex on one\u2019s partner because the\npartner performed oral sex on one). Moreover, these generous, caring,\nand fair motives need not compete with the motive of sexual pleasure:\nknowing that one\u2019s partner enjoys the extra attention, one\nlavishes it on them during the sex. Thus, sexual activity can be\nmorally evaluated as good, not merely permissible (because\nconsensual).\n\nThe language of virtue is relevant here, since acting generously,\ncaringly, or fairly can express virtuous motives (see Halwani 2003,\nch. 3, 2018a, 2018b, ch. 7; Morgan 2003a). Sexual activity, including\nconsensual sexual activity, can also manifest various vices. Consider\nthe following examples.\n\nA student offers their teacher sex for a high grade (the teacher\nconsents).\nA guy has sex with another guy during a wake (neither is directly\nrelated to the dead person).\nLisa hates yet desires Nancy; she wants to sexually humiliate her;\nNancy knows this but desires Lisa, and she does not care. They have\nsex during which Lisa heaps verbal abuse on the trembling-with-desire\nNancy.\nOmar is a handsome gay man who loves having sex with many guys to\nfeed his ego. At the end of the day, all spent, he agrees to a seventh\nhookup because the guy is a catch. He tells the guy, \u201cYou are my\nseventh today, so I might not be very energetic\u201d. The guy says,\n\u201cThis is actually a turn-on\u201d.\nIsabel has undesired sex with her boyfriend so as not to deal with\nhis foul mood (he is not abusive, but accustomed to getting his way),\neven though she knows that she need not agree to sex every time he\nwants it.\n\n\nEach case has the participants\u2019 consent, yet each sexual act is\nbad in some aspect (though not all are seriously wrong) because it\nexhibits a vice: unprofessionalism, intemperance, maliciousness (and\npossibly cruelty and demeaningness; cf. Morgan 2003a), vanity, and\ncowardice, respectively. Thus, consent might not be sufficient for the\nact\u2019s goodness, though perhaps it is for its permissibility\n(depending on the seriousness of the harm or vice).\n\n(2) Sexual and romantic relationships provide the strongest cases for\nsexual obligations, because sexual activity is an expected and crucial\naspect of (especially monogamous) relationships. Note that ordinarily\nthreatening harm to someone unless they have sex is morally wrong, but\nthreats to end a relationship unless the other party has sex\n(\u201cHave sex with me or I will break up with you\u201d) are not\nobviously wrong, further indicating that sexual obligations exist\n(Anderson 2013; Soble 2017a, 2022b; Wertheimer 2003, ch. 12).\n\nThe difficult question is whether there are sexual obligations outside\nsuch relationships. If having sex is a basic need, perhaps plausible\ncases involve a health caretaker alleviating the sexual needs of a\npatient. One can argue that although under the usual conception of\n\u201chealth care professional\u201d (e.g., a nurse) there are no\nsuch duties, society should create a category of such professionals to\nmeet these needs\u2014if they are indeed basic.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that there are positive rights to sex,\nespecially for those who, due to disabilities, are unable to find\nwilling sexual partners without having to pay them. The idea is that\nbecause sexual activity and pleasure with another person are crucial\nto a minimally decent life and not adequately substituted for by\nmasturbation, those who are sexually deprived are entitled to some\nform of partnered sexual activity (Appel 2010; Firth 2019). Others\nhave argued that not all sexually excluded people are disabled and not\nall disabled people are sexually excluded, so the issue of sexual\nexclusion cuts across that of disability (Earp and Moen 2016; Liberman\n2018; Shakespeare 2022).\n\nThe argument for sexual positive rights has been met with resistance\non two fronts. Some have raised concerns about women supplying sex for\nmen given a history of sexism and misogyny, even if the men are\ndisabled (Jeffreys 2008; [see DeBoer 2015 for replies]; Liberman\n2022). Others have argued that such rights to partnered sex imply that\nsome people\u2019s rights to sexual autonomy will be violated, so\nthere are no rights to partnered sex (Danaher 2020; DiNucci 2011,\n2020; Liberman 2022; Srinivasan 2021, ch. 3). The most that is\nconceded is that if there are rights to sex, they are not to partnered\nsex, but to a bundle of services that can help people be more sexually\nincluded, such as validation of a group\u2019s sexuality, sex\neducation, sexual toys and instruments, including sex robots, and even\nprofessional assistance with masturbating or assistance with having\nsex with someone for those who cannot perform these acts on their own\n(the assistants themselves would not be part of the sexual act)\n(Danaher 2020, 2022; DiNucci 2017; Liberman 2022). It is unclear,\nhowever, once sexual partners are off the table, whether what remains\n(e.g., sex education) are proper objects of rights to\nsex.\n\nStill, sexual obligations might exist even without corresponding\nrights, based in general duties of benevolence\u2014attending to\nsomeone\u2019s sexual needs would be similar to attending to\nsomeone\u2019s hunger (Soble 2017a, 454\u201355; 2022b, 546). But it\nis unclear who would fulfill these obligations, what their fulfillment\nwould amount to (is masturbating the beneficiary of the duty enough?),\nand whether the gender and sexual orientation of the parties matters\nor should matter. These are difficult issues, especially since the\nextent to which someone\u2019s sexual needs are properly met does\ndepend on their sexual desires and preferences: a straight man\u2019s\nneeds might not be met by a gay man, and straight women meeting\nmen\u2019s sexual needs is troubling given sexism and sex-based\noppression. Moreover, if X\u2019s sexual need cannot be\nalleviated by X masturbating, how the needs are to be met is\na pressing question, and so is determining the depth of a sexual need\nto see whether it gives rise to an obligation. Ultimately, such sexual\nduties might face the same crucial objection that the right to\npartnered sex faces, namely, that people\u2019s right to sexual\nautonomy is so important that it is incompatible with the existence of\nsexual duties.\n\nEven if we have no obligations to satisfy others\u2019 sexual needs,\nwe might nevertheless have sexual obligations to ourselves to develop\nor dampen certain sexual preferences. Pedophiles, for example, might\nhave an obligation to change their preferences, not merely to refrain\nfrom acting on them. Other examples include obligations to change\none\u2019s preferences (or their lack) for, say, members of a\nparticular race, ethnic group, age group, body type, etc. These are\nmore controversial, however, because it is not clear that such\npreferences are bad to begin with (Barn 2022; Halwani 2017b [2022];\nKershnar 2019; Zheng 2016), and some might not be under our control at\nall (e.g., preference for certain age groups) or as easily changed as\nothers are (e.g., for skin color).\n\n(3) According to Alan Goldman, \u201c[N]o conduct otherwise immoral\nshould be excused because it is sexual conduct, and nothing in sex is\nimmoral unless condemned by rules which apply elsewhere as well\u201d\n(1977, 280). This is true at a general level because the same general\nmoral features (e.g., harm) affect sexual acts. But it might be false\nat more specific levels: sexual violation of the body by a\npenis or an object makes the violation distinct. This has to do with\nhow one experiences sexual bodily violations, thereby making sexual\nconsent a crucial moral aspect of sexual relations (Wertheimer 2003,\n107\u2013112). Moreover, if Kant is right, the objectifying nature of\nsexual desire makes it unique. If virtue ethicists are right, actions\ncan be right and wrong because they are sexually temperate and\nintemperate: seducing the ex-boss\u2019s husband is vengeful or\nintemperate, depending on the motive (Carr 2007; Halwani 2003, ch. 3,\n2018a, 2018b, ch. 7; Piers 1999; see also the essays in SE). The\nspecialness of sex might be explained by sexual desire\u2019s\nrootedness in biology and its being directed at the bodies of other\nhuman beings (Dent 1984: ch. 2 and passim).\n2.2.1 Consent\n\nWhether one is conservative, liberal, or progressive about the\npermissibility of sexual acts, consent looms large. Most philosophers\nbelieve that informed and voluntary consent is necessary and\nsufficient for the moral permissibility of sex (Archard 1998; Mappes\n1987; Miller & Wertheimer 2010; Primoratz 2001; Wertheimer 2003;\nbut see Pateman 1988), though there are dissenters who debate\nconsent\u2019s sufficiency (see below).\n\nConsent is crucial because (a) it transforms an otherwise wrong act\ninto a permissible one (though not necessarily into a good act); (b)\nin heterosexual sex, men and women might importantly differ when it\ncomes to sex; and (c) sexual violation is typically experienced as\nvery harmful (Wertheimer 2003, 119\u2013121).\n\n(a) has been especially important to philosophers. Consent\u2019s\nbeing morally transformative means that it changes an action\u2019s\nmoral status from impermissible to permissible. If John takes a book\nfrom Lisa\u2019s library, the act can be one of robbery or one of\nlending (or gifting) depending on whether Lisa has consented. One\nissue here is whether consent to sexual contact is morally special or\ndifferent from other types of transactions, including nonsexual bodily\ncontact (Chadha 2022, 218\u2013219). For example, is it especially\nimportant to consent to sexual penetration as opposed to, say, a\nshoulder massage or even a colonoscopy? Explanations of the importance\nof sexual consent that rely on our special relationship to our bodies,\nas opposed to our relationship to external objects like books (Gardner\nand Shute 2000), fail to distinguish between consent to sexual bodily\ncontact and consent to nonsexual bodily contact. Perhaps evolutionary\nexplanations are needed (Wertheimer 2003, ch. 2).\n\nThe claim that valid or genuine consent by all the parties to a sex\nact is necessary and sufficient for the moral permissibility of the\nsex act can put as follows:\n\n\nX\u2019s sexual activity with Y is morally\npermissible if, and only if, Y validly consents to the sexual\nactivity.\n\n\nOne crucial question is what it means for Y to validly\nconsent. It seems that Y has to do something, to perform some\naction, that amounts to consent. On the \u201cpurely mental\nview,\u201d the action can be purely mental, such as a thought to the\neffect that \u201cI consent to this act.\u201d But more than mere\nthoughts, decisions, or beliefs might be needed to explain what is\nwrong with cases in which X proceeds to have sex with\nY even though Y, who consents, does not clearly\ncommunicate their consent to X. Hence we get the\n\u201ccommunications view,\u201d according to which X\nwrongs Y if there is no clear communication to proceed with\nthe sexual activity (Chadha 2022; Dougherty 2015, 2018). An important\nissue here is what it would take for Y to clearly communicate\ntheir consent to X. Is enthusiasm, for example, necessary or\nsufficient to convey one\u2019s consent? (Pineau 1989; Dougherty\n2022)\n\nAnother crucial issue is what Y is consenting to exactly when\nY consents to sexual activity. For the consent to be valid,\nthe activity engaged in has to be the one consented to, not some other\nactivity. This seemingly obvious point raises the thorny question of\nwhat constitutes a sexual act and how many acts of consent are needed\nfor a compound or extended sexual act, one that is made up of parts\n(kissing, then oral sex, then penetrative sex, and so on).\n\nThere are additional elements of valid consent, the two most important\nones being lack of coercion and lack of deception. Coercion undermines\nthe voluntary aspect of consent, and deception undermines its informed\naspect (Dougherty 2013; Mappes 1987). Other elements are being of\nsound mind and having the cognitive and emotional maturity to consent\n(Chadha 2022, 223). After all, we can imagine cases in which neither\ncoercion nor deception is involved, yet one is too young or too\ninebriated to consent. If \u201cinformed consent\u201d means simply\nreceiving or having the requisite information, we might need\nadditional criteria like maturity and soundness of mind. If it means\nsomething stronger, such as \u201cproperly processing the\ninformation,\u201d perhaps maturity and soundness of mind are\nredundant. A final element of valid consent might be lack of\nexploitation, especially in unequal relationships, given that the\nstronger party might take advantage of the weaker one despite neither\ncoercing nor deceiving the weaker one (Archard 1994; Mappes 1987; for\ncriticism of Archard\u2019s views, see Boonin 2022).\n\nIs valid consent sufficient for a sexual act\u2019s moral\npermissibility? The views discussed in 2.2 that restrict permissible\nsex to an affectionate, mutually respectful, or marital context take\nconsent to be necessary but not sufficient. Moreover, if sexual desire\nby nature objectifies, as the Kantian view has it, then the consent of\nthe parties is insufficient because consent to sex is consent to a\nwrong action (see 2.2.2).\n\nA different reason for rejecting the sufficiency of consent is harm.\nSetting aside harm to third parties, if sexual activity leads to harm\nto one or more of its parties, then consent might not be sufficient.\nThis view is especially plausible when it comes to women, given that\nmany women engage in consensual sex that is motivated by\nnonsexual desires, such as not wanting to put their partner in a foul\nmood. According to one account, the harm is psychological, especially\nto their autonomy (West 1995). This implies that prostitutes are\nharmed because of their consent to undesired sex, an implausible\nimplication. However, even if specific formulations of the view are\nimplausible (such as West\u2019s; see Soble 1996, 37\u201339;\nWertheimer 2003, passim), this does not negate the plausible\nclaim that if sexual activity harms one or more of the\nconsenting parties, the activity is wrong. One might object that this\nargument is paternalistic, telling people not to engage in sex when\nthe sex is harmful (Soble 1996, 37\u201339). This objection is\ncorrect in that although harmful sex gives the participants a reason\nto not engage in it, it cannot be used to argue that social or legal\nforces should prevent this action (Wertheimer 2003,\n130\u2013131).\n\nDespite disagreement about the sufficiency of consent, the\nnecessity of consent is typically taken for granted by\nphilosophers. But its necessity can be questioned. For instance, if we\naccept a \u201ccasual view\u201d of sexual pleasure, \u201cthat\nsexual pleasure is morally like any other pleasure\u201d (Benatar\n2002, 192; see also Beckwith 2022), consent might not be necessary.\nFor if sexual pleasure is insignificant, a person\u2019s consent may\nbe bypassed if there are cases, bizarre as they might seem, in which\nforcing someone, or not requiring their consent, to have sex with\nanother person might be important or needed (to the former person,\nespecially). This might occur with people with impaired abilities (see\nbelow), or even with minors if an ambitious parent thinks that it is a\ngood idea for their child to experience some sexual activity (not\nnecessarily intercourse) with another person (Benatar 2002,\n194\u2013195).\n\nHowever, we need not accept a single view of sexual pleasure as casual\nor significant; we can instead argue that, depending on between whom\nthe pleasure occurs, it might or might not be casual (Halwani 2022a,\n48\u201351). Moreover, if, as seems to be the case, people\u2019s\nconsidered beliefs about sex are that sex is significant (imagine\nclaiming that incest or sex with animals is \u201ccool\u201d because\nsex is casual), the casual view of sex might very well be wrong, in\nwhich case the consensus surrounding the necessity of consent remains\nintact.\n\nWhy is sex significant? Sex is significant in that it involves\none\u2019s most important private space: one\u2019s body. Suppose\nthat X is a social person, always happy to have guests over\nat X\u2019s house. One day, X discovers that some\npeople have entered X\u2019s apartment and used it to\nentertain themselves. X feels justifiably violated,\nindicating that the violation of private spaces is a serious wrong. If\nthis is true of an apartment, it is true of one\u2019s body,\nespecially since sexual violation usually involves the insertion of\nsomething in the body. This explains why sexual violations are\nexperienced as deeply traumatic (Wertheimer 2003, ch.5). Sex is\nsignificant because it pertains to one\u2019s most important and\nprivate space (cf. Brogaard 2015, 188\u2013190). Note that even if\n(or when) sex is significant, it does not follow that it must be\nexperienced only in the context of love or mutually respectful\nrelationship; it can be experienced casually as long as consent is\nsecured.\n\nJohn Gardner (2018) argues that consent might not be necessary to sex\nbecause we usually require consent to things that are done to\nsomeone, whereas sex, at least ideally, involves a mutuality that\nrenders sexual activity a joint activity. Chadha (2020) replies that\njoint actions are made up of sub-actions, for each of which consent is\nnecessary. Gardner could reply that sexual sub-actions are also joint,\nso consent to them is unnecessary. Moreover, even if some are not\njoint, that some are is enough to show that consent is not always\nnecessary for sex. Still, it is unclear why joint activities render\nconsent unnecessary. My participation in synchronized swimming or a\nmusical duet still needs my consent.\n\nPeople with severely impaired cognitive abilities raise complicated\nissues for sexual consent. Assuming that they desire sex but are\nunable to consent, or are unable to communicate it clearly, we are\nfaced with the options of either denying them sex or re-thinking\nconsent in their case, such as relying on the idea of advance consent\n(Bianchi 2022a; 2022b; Director 2019). Andrea Bianchi argues that for\npeople with dementia we need to prioritize their well-being over\nconsent because the issue of their quality of life is of \u201cthe\nupmost importance\u201d (2022b, 365). She relies on the distinction\nbetween consenting to something and assenting with something, the\nlatter of which, used in medical practices, describes \u201ca\nperson\u2019s active willingness to engage in an act, specifically\nwhen they may lack the ability to fully comprehend it (e.g., the\nbenefits and risks)\u201d (2022b, 363\u2013364). If Bianchi is\nright, only valid consent, not consent as such, would not be necessary\nfor people with dementia to have sex, because assent is still a form\nof rudimentary consent. One difficulty with the argument is that valid\nconsent might be seen as important for someone\u2019s well-being as\nmuch as, if not more than, satisfying their desires is, so basing the\nargument on the priority of well-being might take us only so far.\n2.2.2 Objectification\n\nObjectification is a perennial issue in the philosophy of sex. It\noriginates in Kant\u2019s moral philosophy, and many feminists have\nadopted the language of objectification to criticize, for example,\npornography; though whereas Kant was concerned with the objectifying\nnature of sexual desire, feminists do not target sex as such, but only\nin the context of patriarchy, claiming that it involves the sexual\nobjectification of women by men in certain contexts (see below; some\nclaim that all heterosexual sex is poison under patriarchy, e.g.,\nDworkin 1987). Indeed, sexual desire might not be necessary for the\nclaim that a woman is sexually objectified under patriarchy: a man\nneed not sexually desire a woman to catcall her.\n\nSexual objectification is treating or considering a person\nonly as a sex object. Casual sex, watching pornography,\ncatcalling, ogling, and other examples all allegedly involve sexual\nobjectification. The \u201conly\u201d is important because otherwise\nthere is no basis for moral complaint given that we frequently treat\neach other as objects. It is unclear whether objectification can\nconsist of mere mental regard or whether it must have a treatment\ncomponent (ogling someone is interesting because it is unclear whether\nit is treatment or mere regard). Some philosophers (Langton 2009;\nNussbaum 1995; Papadaki 2017;) define \u201csexual\nobjectification\u201d broadly enough to include mere regard (others,\ne.g., LeMoncheck [1985, ch. 1] do not). The inclusion of regard is\nwise because objectification seems to involve mere attitudes and\nperceptions (e.g., ogling, the regard found in watching pornography).\nX then sexually objectifies Y if, and only if,\nX treats or regards Y only as a sexual object.\n\nThe importance of objectification stems from a view of human beings as\nmore than objects (LeMoncheck 1985, ch. 1; Papadaki 2017). If human\nbeings, regardless of individual merit, have elevated moral status in\nvirtue of having rationality, dignity, autonomy, or some such\nproperty, reducing someone to a lower level is wrong. But how\ncommon the actual occurrence of sexual objectification and\nhow serious it is, are additional questions. It seems rare to\ntreat our sexual partners as mere objects in any obvious and troubling\nways: not only are we aware of their humanity, we are also attentive\nto it. Indeed, among the various ways of\nobjectification\u2014instrumentality, denial of autonomy, inertness,\nfungibility, violability, ownership, and denial of subjectivity (this\nis Nussbaum\u2019s list [1995, 257]; cf. Langton 2009,\n228\u2013229)\u2014only instrumentality is common. Others, such as\nownership and denial of subjectivity, seem rare (Halwani 2017a;\nHalwani 2022b). Clear cases of sexual objectification include\nsexually-motivated rape and catcalling.\n\nThe Kantian view is that sexual desire objectifies by its nature and\nmakes it impossible for the sexual partners to satisfy the Categorical\nImperative: \u201cAct in such a way that you treat humanity, whether\nin your own person or in the person of another, always at the same\ntime as an end and never simply as a means\u201d (Kant 1785 [1981],\n429). Equally problematic on this view is X objectifying\nX\u2019s self\u2014usually through masturbation or allowing\nX\u2019s self to be objectified by Y. Kant\nconsidered duties to the self to be important and his treatment of\nobjectification clearly includes duties to the self: when a human\nbeing has sex for the mere pleasure of it, he \u201csurrenders his\npersonality (throwing it away), since he uses himself merely as a\nmeans to satisfy an animal impulse\u201d (1797 [1996], 6: 425; see\nalso Kant 1930 [1963], 162\u2013168; Soble 2017b, 309\u2013313;\n2022c, 411\u2013415)]. The prohibition on allowing one\u2019s own\nself to be objectified, in addition to the focus on the nature of\nsexual desire, is what sets the Kantian view apart from other views of\nobjectification, especially feminist ones.\n\nSexual desire objectifies by its nature because when X\nsexually desires Y, X desires Y\u2019s\nbody and body parts, especially the sexual ones, making it hard, if\nnot impossible, to treat the humanity in Y as an end (Kant\n1930 [1963, 164]). Only sexual desire among our inclinations is\ndirected at human beings as \u201cflesh,\u201d not \u201ctheir work\nand services\u201d (Kant 1930 [1963, 163]). Although it is morally\npermissible to use each other for all sorts of purposes as long as\nthey involve our \u201cwork and services,\u201d sexual interactions\nare different. In almost every interaction with each other, we are\ninterested in some ability, talent, or service that another can\nperform, an aspect intimately connected to their rationality. In these\ncases, either X does not desire Y\u2019s body (but\nY\u2019s abilities, talents, or services) or X\ndesires it but as a vehicle of Y\u2019s abilities.\nOnly with sexual desire (and, Kant says, in the rare case of\ncannibalism; 1930 [1963, 162\u201363]) does X desire\nY as a body, as an object. X wants to enjoy\nY\u2019s body, not Y\u2019s beautiful voice,\nmassaging abilities, or computer skills (and if X does want\nthe latter aspects in the context of sexual desire and activity,\nX wants them insofar as they make Y more sexually\nappealing). Sexual desire renders people objects by reversing\nour normal relationship with their bodies. Their bodies become the\nobjects, not the instruments, of our attention. Kant thought that only\nmarriage can make objectification tolerable (Kant 1930 [1963, 163]),\nthough his argument is implausible (see Soble 2013b, 2017b; Denis\n2001; Wertheimer 2003, 130\u2013135).\n\nConsent is thus not sufficient for permissible sex because consenting\nto sex is consenting to objectification, to something wrong (Soble\n2017b, 303\u2013304). Kant\u2019s view indicates also why including\nregard in a definition of \u201csexual objectification\u201d is\nplausible: even though X and Y treat each other well\nduring sex, they still regard each other as mere sex objects.\n\nThe phenomenology of sexual desire seems to confirm Kant\u2019s\npoint: The \u201cother\u2019s body, their lips, thighs, buttocks,\nand toes, are desired as the arousing parts they are, distinct from\nthe person\u201d (Soble 2013b, 302). During a good sexual act, even\nwith one\u2019s lover, at some point they focus on ass, cock, pussy,\ntits, etc. (Vannoy 1980, 14). Kant\u2019s view that sexual desire and\nactivity are different\u2014perhaps even unique\u2014from other ways\nwe view and interact with other people seems correct, providing\nsupport for the conclusion that sexual desire objectifies.\n\nSexual desire seems also powerful: its pull is strong and its voice\nloud, insisting, and persistent, so much so that people do irrational\nand immoral things to satisfy it. This might be a gendered feature of\nsexual desire, more true of men than of women, though throughout\nhistory, and in today\u2019s popular culture especially, women have\noften been portrayed as sexually insatiable (see Anderson &\nStruckman-Johnson 1998; Soble 2008, ch. 10). Of course, sexual\npartners normally observe limits on how they treat each other: they do\nnot violate each other, treat each other literally as objects, and so\non, exactly because they understand that they may not treat people in\nsuch ways. Thus, sexual desire operates within moral red lines.\n\nThe Kantian problem of objectification cannot be easily solved.\nArguing that there is no objectification because human beings have no\nspecial moral status from which they can be lowered (Soble 2002,\n53\u201363) does not meet Kant on his own grounds (as Soble insists\nin 2013b; 2017b; 2022c). Claiming that parties to the sexual act\nnormally consent to it (Mappes 1987), that objectification is okay as\nlong as the relationship is respectful (Nussbaum 1995, esp.\n227\u2013231), or that sexual partners attend to each other\u2019s\nsexual needs (Goldman 1977, 282\u2013283; Singer 1984, 382) also do\nnot solve the problem because none addresses the nature of sexual\ndesire (Soble 2013b; 2017b; 2022c).\n\nTwo other options are to accept the problem as a problem (but perhaps\nminimize it; Halwani 2017a; 2022b) or to argue that sexual desire\namong human beings is not always objectifying. This is not merely the\nidea, insisted on by the intentionalist view, that sexual desire in\nhuman beings is complex, because a Kantian view of sex can accommodate\nthis point, but that\n\n\nthere is far more to sex than the desire to use another\u2019s body\nin a degrading manner for your selfish pleasure. Even the elements in\nsexual desire closest to this are combined, at least in healthy\npeople, with other elements of human emotion that radically transform\ntheir meaning. (Wood 2008, 227)\n\n\nKant\u2019s view, however, can also accommodate this insight. For\nexample, X might sexually desire Y because\nY is, among other things, a kind person, such that X\nwould not have desired Y otherwise. But once X\ndesires Y, X desires Y\u2019s body and\nbody parts. Sexual desire can be selfish while layered within other\nelements of human emotions, and the Kantian view need not be confined\nto a simplistic view of sexual desire such that it is crassly selfish\nor always acted on in a degrading \u201cmanner\u201d; Kantian sex\ncan be attentive to the other\u2019s needs.\n\nNonetheless, the above idea that sexual desire can be combined with\nhealthy emotions makes it possible that sexual desire is not always\ntoxic, though how remains unclear. To succeed, sexual desire needs to\nbe injected with healthy emotions, and not merely added to them, so\nthat its very nature changes on particular occasions.\n\nOn the Kantian view, not all sexual activity is objectifying:\nsexual activity not stemming from sexual desire might not be\nobjectifying. Even in those cases when sexual activity is\nobjectifying, its seriousness varies: in consensual encounters it\ncompetes with other moral factors, whereas in (sexually motivated)\nrape it is very serious as sexual desire is the primary motive. (The\nmotive is not to sexually objectify someone, as this is rare;\ninstead, X regards Y in a way that is sexually\nobjectifying.)\n\nMoreover, sexual objectification might differ between men and women,\nespecially if men and women experience sex differently. Men experience\nsexual desire more frequently and insistently than women, though both\nare similar in their enjoyment of sexual activity (Ogas and Gaddam\n2011, chs. 3 and 4; Symons 1979, 179; Wertheimer 2003, 38\u201346).\nThus, men might engage in more sexual objectification than do women\ngiven that men think about sex more, ogle others more, and are more\neasily turned on visually. Since during sexual activity both would\nsexually objectify each other roughly equally, men would sexually\nobjectify women overall more than women would men. Men also consume\npornography (straight and gay) far more than women do, so would engage\nin much more sexual objectification than do women (by viewing people\non-screen, by viewing people as mere sexual objects, etc.). It is\nperhaps in this sense that pornography allows women (and men, as\nobjects of other men\u2019s desire) to be objectified.\n\nSome feminists have argued that pornography objectifies women by\ndehumanizing them, and it dehumanizes them by depicting them as mere\nsexual instruments for men (Hill 1987), by depicting their pleasure as\nonly for the men\u2019s (Longino 1980), by endorsing this treatment\n(Longino 1980; Eaton 2007), or by sending the message that all women\nare like those depicted in pornography (Garry 1978). But these claims\nseem unconvincing. Pornography shows both men and women sexually\nenjoying each other, and it is difficult to prove that women\u2019s\npleasure is depicted as merely for the men\u2019s (one might as well\nargue for the reverse) because the scenes themselves do not tell us\nanything (Soble 2002, 19\u201320, 28, 98, 196; 1996, 225\u2013227).\nNor does pornography seem to send messages about the status of women,\nwhether about the depicted women or women in general. Doing so\ndisables the viewer\u2019s ability to imagine the scenes as he wants,\nthereby undermining its own purposes of titillating him (Soble 1996,\n231\u2013234). But pornography enables the sexual objectification of\nwomen by displaying them to the gaze of the male viewer (ditto for men\nin pornography, albeit the gay male gaze). This form of\nobjectification seems innocuous, as long as it is not implicated in\nharm towards women, either individually or as a class (Gruen 2006; see\nalso Eaton 2007).\n\nA deeper form of objectification is found in the view that pornography\nconstructs women\u2019s sexuality in a bad way (MacKinnon 1993;\nDworkin 1974, 1979). It eroticizes patriarchal ways of viewing women,\nso that sexual desire becomes infused with dominance (cf. Morgan\n2003a, 388\u2013390). The sexual desires of young men who routinely\nconsume pornography become desires for the sexual domination of women.\nWomen become socially constructed sexual beings for men, such that men\ndesire them as pornography depicts them\u2014as non-real beings:\n\u201cobjectification comes to define femininity, and one-sidedness\ncomes to define mutuality\u201d (MacKinnon 1993, 26; see Mason-Grant\n2004). This view, however, implausibly neglects sexual desire\u2019s\nbiology, assuming that sexual desire can be fully socially\nconstructed. Moreover, insofar as it is an empirical view, no proper\nevidence has been marshalled in its support (Diorio 2006; Tarrant\n2014).\n\nSexual desire, as we have seen, is sufficient for objectification.\nHowever, it is not necessary. The guy catcalling a woman to feel part\nof the group is an example, and so are pornography directors and\neditors, who, by choosing the angle of the camera and the footage\ncuts, help sexually objectify the performers by presenting them to the\nviewer in particular ways; similar reasoning applies to, say, brothel\nowners. Indeed, women themselves might have few options other than to\nsexually objectify themselves, in a society that values women mostly\nthrough their sexuality (J\u00fctten 2016; Marino 2022a, 2022b). This\nmight be the most pernicious form of sexual objectification in that\nsocial forces direct or pressure (not necessarily force) women to\nadopt such self-identifications or self-presentations to lead better\nlives, though whether they are actually flourishing is harder to\ngauge.\n\nRecently, the concept of \u201cderivatization\u201d has been used to\nexamine sex and sexual practices (Parker 2017; Wolf 2016).\n\n\nTo derivatize something is to portray, render, understand, or approach\na being solely or primarily as the reflection, projection, or\nexpression of another being\u2019s identity, desires, fears, etc. The\nderivatized subject becomes reducible in all relevant ways to the\nderivatizing subject\u2019s existence. (Cahill 2011, 32; see also\n2013)\n\n\nThis view might capture some central feminist problems with\npornography, namely, the depiction of women\u2019s sexuality as\nreflecting men\u2019s sexual desires of women. However,\n\u201cderivatization\u201d seems not to cover all cases (or all\ncases well). Consider a closeted gay man who catcalls a woman only to\nimpress his peers. He objectifies her but does not seem to derivatize\nher. If the reply is that he catcalls that particular woman because\nshe represents not his desires but, say, society\u2019s desires of\nwhat women should look like, then, given that for any sexual situation\none can attribute derivatization to some party or other,\n\u201cderivatization\u201d stands in danger of being empty or too\nbroad to be explanatory.\n2.3 Sexual Perversion\n\nThe most famous contemporary philosophical account is Thomas\nNagel\u2019s psychologically-based view of sexual perversion.\n\u201cNatural\u201d sexual desire involves a multi-leveled mutual\nawareness by two people of each other: X perceives sexual\nexcitement in Y, Y perceives excitement in\nX, X perceives that Y is excited by\nX, and so on (1969, 10\u201312). Sexual desire is complex in\nthat it includes X\u2019s sexual arousal by Y and\nX\u2019s feeling sexual because of Y\u2019s\narousal by X, and so on with higher levels. Sexual\nperversions are then standing preferences for sexual activity that\ndoes not involve such multi-levels of sexual arousal. Since this view\nlocates naturalness and perversion in the agent\u2019s preferences,\nthe sexual act itself need not mirror this structure; only the desires\nneed have this complexity. Thus, it is inaccurate to accuse it of\nbeing sexless (Solomon 1974, 336) or to evaluate it by giving examples\nof non-complex sexual acts (Kupfer 2016, 333).\n\nAlthough this view accommodates some perversions, such as zoophilia,\npedophilia, and \u201cintercourse with \u2026 inanimate\nobjects\u201d because they \u201cseem to be stuck at some primitive\nversion of the first stage of sexual feeling\u201d (Nagel 1969, 14),\nit yields counter-intuitive results: masturbation does not fare well\non this view, depending on whether it insists on the perception of the\nactual (not imaginative) embodiment of desire in another person (Soble\n2013a, 85\u201387). It also misunderstands how perversions usually\nwork: a coprophiliac does not normally desire sex with feces,\nbut to incorporate feces in his sexual act with another, which could\ninvolve multi-levels of perception. Moreover, the account does not\ncapture common intuitions about natural and perverted sex: it goes\nbeyond the plausible idea that the arousal of one partner increases\nthe other\u2019s, to that of multi-layered arousal\u2014an\nunintuitive idea. Similar views rely on the idea that natural sexual\ndesire is interpersonal, such as that it culminates in love (Scruton\n1986, ch. 10) and that it communicates attitudes and feelings (Solomon\n1974; see Halwani 2018b, ch. 9 for discussion).\n\nA non-psychological account of sexual perversion, one closer to folk\nbiology, claims that only reproduction allows us to distinguish\nperversions from non-perversions (Ruddick 1984, 287; cf. Gray 1978).\nThis does not mean that every act has to be reproductive, only that\nnatural sexual desires \u201ccould lead to reproduction in\nnormal physiological circumstances\u201d (Ruddick 1984, 288). Thus, a\nheterosexual couple having intercourse but not intending to procreate\nare not engaging in perverted sex: their desire is of the\nkind that, under \u201cnormal physiological\ncircumstances,\u201d could lead to reproduction (1984, 288).\n\nThe account might have implausible implications, however. Anyone who\nprefers (heterosexual) oral sex to intercourse would be perverted.\nMoreover, any heterosexual couple that incorporate fetish objects,\nurine, feces, and so on, in their sexual intercourse would be\nsexually natural (Gray 1978, 190\u2013192; Primoratz 1999,\n53\u201354). Indeed, coprophilia can sink all the above accounts: two\npeople who exhibit inter-personal attitudes in the form of multi-level\nperceptions, and who have sexual intercourse of the reproductive type,\ncommunicating healthy emotions sincerely, yet use feces in their\nactivity would counter-intuitively not be perverted on any of the\nabove accounts.\n\nEven though explaining perversion in terms of biology seems obvious,\n\u201cperversion\u201d is opposed not only to \u201cnatural,\u201d\nbut also to \u201cnormal,\u201d and the natural and the normal do\nnot fully overlap. Moreover, the concept of \u201cperversion\u201d\ncould refer to many things: the immoral, disgusting, bizarre, and\nbiologically abnormal, among others. Using only one of these to define\n\u201cperversion\u201d will probably fail. It might also be that the\nmethodology of discussing this concept is flawed, failing to account\nfor the concept\u2019s social function (Miller 2010). Thus, some\nphilosophers have proposed to get rid of the concept altogether\n(Priest 1997; Primoratz 1999, ch. 6; Ruse 1988, 197\u2013201).\nRecently, however, a new account of perversion in terms of its\ninhibiting \u201cshared joy, mutual exploration, self-affirmation,\nand union\u201d was offered (Kupfer 2016, 351). But this view seems\nto set the bar too high for what counts as non-perverted.\n\nA good account of perversion might have to be prescriptive, capturing\nthe core of perversion but not necessarily capturing all our beliefs\nabout it (it should explain why our beliefs are mistaken when they\nare). Furthermore, it will likely be a psychological account, a\npreference to have sex with or involving certain types of object that\nare anti-life, such as bodily waste and corpses, and that are\nbiologically odd, such as inter-species sexual intercourse.\nEvolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology would have to play\ncrucial roles.\n2.4 Sex and Technology\n\nThe discussion of sexual exclusion and inclusion has led some\nphilosophers to suggest that sexual needs can be met by sexual robots\nthat can replace the need for partnered sex, especially if the\ntechnology is advanced enough so that sex with the robots provides an\nalmost identical experience to sex with another human being (DiNucci\n2017; McArthur 2017). This raises a few philosophical questions of its\nown. First, if the robots are sophisticated enough, they might be\npersons, which means that they, too, might have rights to sexual\nautonomy, which takes us back to the same issues with rights to\npartnered sex. It also raises the general question of how to morally\ninteract with them (Nyholm 2022; Petersen 2017).\n\nSecond, there are feminist concerns as to what these robots would look\nlike: if they are meant to \u201cappeal to a stereotypical male\ngaze,\u201d then \u201ctheir use might encourage or exacerbate the\nobjectification and dehumanization of actual women\u201d (Liberman\n2022, 458). Another feminist concern, regardless of the robots\u2019\nlook, is that ease of sex with them, and their inability to genuinely\nrefuse sex, might also entrench sexist attitudes toward women,\nespecially that of male entitlement to sex (Danaher, Earp, and\nSandberg 2017; Richardson 2005).\n\nIssues with sex robots do not exhaust those of sex and technology.\nAnother has to do with the effects on our lives of the use of dating\nand hook up apps, weighing their benefits and their costs. While such\napps have allowed people to meet each other with more ease and to be\nselective in their choices, some worry that they allow them to be\ntoo selective, abetting lookism and racist desires (McArthur\n2022a and 2022b; see also Klincewicz, Frank, and Jane 2022). Neil\nMcArthur argues that the benefits are greater than the costs, many of\nwhich can, anyway, be fixed (2022a, 2022b).\n\nMcArthur also argues that technology has given rise to a new sexual\nidentity\u2014digisexuality. Digisexuals are \u201cpeople for whom\nadvanced technologies are an integral part of their preferred sexual\nexperience, and who might not see the need for human sexual partners\nin order to have fulfilling sex\u201d (2022a, 342). McArthur thinks\nthat new identities are a good thing, because they allow like-minded\npeople to find each other, and such identities can help usher in legal\nand social protections (if needed).\n\nIn addition to robots and apps, a third issue with sexual technology\nare \u201cInternet-mediated haptic sex toys capable of remote\ntransmission of tactile sensation\u201d (Arrell 2022, 586). Such\ntechnologies have a large array of benefits, but they raise their own\nproblems, such as third parties hacking the systems and thus having\nsex by deception or assaulting one or more of the parties to the\nsystems, and partners claiming to be something other than who they\nare, such that even if one is not deceived that one is having sex\nwith, say, John, who John says he is, is not who he actually is\n(Sparrow and Karas 2020).\n\nVirtual reality and augmented reality technologies (or, more\ngenerally, extended reality technologies) are, according to Robbie\nArrell, more likely than androids to be the future because they are\ncheaper, multi-purposed, can be moved around and stored more easily,\nand they are but a short step from current pornography technology\n(2022, 595). Although these technologies have benefits, they raise the\nmoral worries of deepfakes and the possibility of people coming to\nprefer sex through them than with real-life sex partners (Arrell 2022,\n595\u2013596).\n3. The Value of Sex\n\nWhat is the value of sex? How important (or valuable!) is this value?\nProcreation, love, and pleasure are obvious answers to the first\nquestion. Sex is usually the way to procreate, so sex is valuable\ninsofar as procreation is valuable. But this value is instrumental,\nand it is contingent given technology\u2019s ability to separate\nprocreation from sex. There is also anti-natalism (Schopenhauer 1851,\n1859, ch. 46; Benatar 2006, 2015), which implies that sex has negative\nvalue in its procreative aspect. The value of sex in regard to\nprocreation is thus precarious.\n\nAnother instrumental value of sex is that X\u2019s sexual\ndesire for Y can (help) cause X to love Y\n(Bertocci 1949, ch. 2). Here, sex\u2019s value is contingent on\nlove\u2019s, and, despite sounding strange, the value of romantic\nlove, especially in its early, passionate stages, is not obvious given\nits negative effects on the lover and others. Still, if sex leads to\nthe settled stage of love (via the passionate one), it is valuable for\nthat. Sex can also express love and affection for one\u2019s partner\nand cement their relationship. Natasha McKeever argues that many goods\nof sex\u2014pleasure, union, intimacy, and care\u2014are shared with\nthose of love, so sexual interaction enhances and strengthens the love\n(McKeever 2016; see also McKeever 2017, but see Vannoy 1980: ch. 1).\nEven if true, all this still makes sex\u2019s value dependent on and\ninstrumental to love\u2019s, especially since the two are very\ndifferent (Goldman 1977, 272\u2013275; Soble 2008, ch. 9 [which adds\nmarriage to the mix]; Vannoy 1980, 7\u201312).\n\nDoes sex have intrinsic value? If it does, it is probably sexual\npleasure, as-sensation or as-enjoyment, a pleasure that provides\npeople with a crucial motive for having sex, often with drastic\nconsequences. So then how valuable is the pleasure of sex? Perhaps we\nshould regard our appetite for sex like we do that for food to avoid\nobsessing about it (Russell 1929 [1970, 289]). But can we go\nfurther?\n\nPeople spend much time pursuing projects and activities they enjoy or\nconsider worthwhile. Some do so only when time, work, or family time\npermit, and some do so much of the time (they are, say, independently\nwealthy). Writing, pursuing Hollywood or Bollywood stardom, playing\nchess, swimming, traveling, and, of course, building a family are\nexamples. Other than philosophical far-fetched examples of worthless\npursuits (counting blades of grass, collecting bottle caps), most\nprojects and activities have some worth, unless we are\nwilling to condemn most human beings of having worthless lives.\nPerhaps some projects are more worthwhile than others (though how to\nargue for this is difficult), but almost all have some worth, and an\nintellectual one at that, including what many might consider to be\nmentally passive, such as watching reality television or reading junk\nfiction (Carroll 1998, esp. ch. 1 and 2).\n\nNow consider X, whose life project is the pursuit of sexual\npleasures. X says,\n\n\nI am young, moderately good-looking, and, with current technology, I\ncan easily sexually hook up with others. I enjoy sex, and it makes me\nfeel good. In between bouts of sex, I can see friends, go to the gym,\nmovies, whatever. But my deepest enjoyment\u2014my life-plan, to use\nphilosophical jargon\u2014is to pursue the pleasures of sex.\n\n\nIs there something we can say to prove X wrong, especially if\nX has the talent for something considered more important?\nPerhaps we can claim that pursuing sex is not as worthy as reading\nRussian literature, but even here we are on insecure ground.\n\nOne can argue that X is not using X\u2019s\nintellectual powers. But this underestimates the reliance on intellect\nin sexual pursuits or presumes that such use is unimportant.\nAlternatively, one can argue that X is not using\nX\u2019s intellectual powers deeply or in a theoretical way.\nBut this would rule out many a life as good. One can argue that there\nare more important things in life than pursuing sexual pleasure. But\nX need not live without friends, family, and other important\nthings present in normal lives. One can argue that sex objectifies, so\nit is wrong to make it central to one\u2019s life. But unless one\nwere a die-hard Kantian, the objectification involved in sex can be\nredeemed by other factors.\n\nOne can argue that sexual sensory pleasure \u201cwill not be at the\ncenter of a rational life plan,\u201d and that these pleasures are\n\u201cintermittent and short-lived,\u201d their value ultimately\ndepending \u201centirely on the interpersonal relationships into\nwhich they fit and which constitute their context\u201d (Goldman\n2016: 98). But it is unclear why the pleasures\u2019 brevity and\nintermittency are problems. One can argue that someone who prefers\nmasturbation to sex with others \u201ccould reflect a failure to\nunderstand the importance and value of sex and sexual pleasure\u201d\n(Scanlon 1998, 175) because the importance of sex is its expression in\nrelations with other people (Scanlon seems not to have in mind casual\nor promiscuous sex). But X can have affectionate sexual\nrelationships with others, and friendships, etc., with different\nothers. Even casual hookups have their bonding aspects. Finally, one\ncan argue that sex \u201cachieves a level of passion\u201d with\n\u201cno equal in other forms of interaction,\u201d especially when\nit occurs between lovers\n\n\nit defines a most significant moment of goodness between two people,\nwhere each achieves a most profound moment of affirmation and\nsatisfaction that is inextricably tied to the endeavor to please the\nother (Thomas 1999, 59).\n\n\nBut note how the affirmation and satisfaction here can as easily apply\nto passionate yet love-less sex.\n\nThus, even if pursuing sexual pleasure is not as intellectually\nstimulating as reading classical Arabic poetry, it is not worthless,\nwhether intellectually or non-intellectually, and it is on a par with\nmany other pursuits that people undertake that are far from having\nintellectual depth. Moreover,\n\n\n[I]sn\u2019t being a provider of sexual pleasure an important and\nvaluable attribute, one to be cherished? Maybe we should construct a\ntheory of human dignity based on our sexual capacities \u2026\ninstead of looking for something \u201cfiner\u201d beyond or above\nthe sexual (Soble 2002, 58\u201359).\n\n\nIf X conducts X\u2019s life morally, and if\nX develops some talents or hobbies for those rainy\ndays (sure to come) when X is no longer sexually desirable\nand X\u2019s friends are busy with other things, then\nX\u2019s life is not less worthwhile than most human lives.\nClaiming otherwise is philosophically haughty and pretentious.\n",
