    "main_text": "How should family structures be evaluated? || The Interests of Children\n2.3 The Interests of Children\n\n\nAlthough some families cannot or choose not to have children, it is\nimpossible to think about issues surrounding the family and\nreproduction without considering the interests of children. Putting\nchildren into the equation also shows how we need to think very\nconcretely about the meaning and implications of the values we\nendorse.\n\n\nConsider choice based arguments in favor of contractual families.\nChildren do not choose to enter their families; moreover, children are,\nat least initially, completely dependent on their caretakers. Parents\nare rightly taken to have an obligation to care for their children that\ndoes not rest on children's consent or contract. Furthermore, a choice by\nparents to participate in a gendered family affects the lives of their\nchildren. The free choices of such parents generate unequal\nopportunities for their children, inequalities that children themselves\nhave not chosen.\n\n\nAlthough some thinkers have advocated licensing parents (Mill 1869,\nLaFollette 1980), today anyone who can biologically produce a child\ncan be a parent. (The issue becomes complicated when more than two\npeople are involved in the production of a child, as we will see\nbelow.) Adoption is highly regulated by law, but once an adoption is\ncompleted, law treats biological and non-biological parents alike with\nrespect to raising their children. Society gives wide discretion to\nall families in rearing children and intervenes only when children\nsuffer abuse, or where the family falls apart. Earlier courts used a\n\u201cbest interests\u201d standard to determine custody in such\ncases. But this standard has been subjected to powerful criticisms:\nreasonable people will differ about what constitutes the\n\u201cbest\u201d for their child; and the standard is easily\nsusceptible to biases based on class, race and sexual orientation. Ian\nShapiro (1999) advocates a \u201cbasic interest\u201d standard for\nlegitimizing state intervention. We might think of such basic\ninterests as defining a line beneath which no child should be allowed\nto sink. The question for feminists here is whether gender equality is\na basic interest of children and if so how best to promote it.\n\n\nFeminists have begun to explore some of the gender issues\nsurrounding adoption and parental rights; including whether an unwed\nfather should have veto rights to the mother's decision to place their\nchild up for adoption; and the roles of gestational as well as genetic\ncontribution in determining parenthood (Shanley 2001).\n\n\nWhen we think of children, we must also think of how they are\nproduced. Some feminists see women's subordination as fundamentally\ncaused by their role in reproduction: on this view, only test tube\nbabies will make possible women's equality (Firestone 1970). But this\nseems like an overstatement: it is not the biology of child production\nthat makes women subordinate but its sociology and economics. Surely,\nadoptive mothers are as vulnerable to inegalitarian workplace\nstructures of gender hierarchy as biological ones. Nonetheless,\nbearing a child can have dramatic and negative consequences for women\nwhen it occurs in a context of little social support and rigid job\nstructures. Researchers have increasingly documented a\n\u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d: women who raise children fall behind\ntheir unmarried counterparts in salary and position. The U.S. Family\nand Medical Leave Act was a partial step in the right direction of\ncompensating parenthood, granting twelve weeks of unpaid leave for a\nnew parent with all benefits and the right to return to the same or a\ncomparable job. But it is difficult to enforce, and work culture makes\nit hard for those entitled to exercise their right. Men, in particular\nare unlikely to take time off following the birth of a child.\n\n\nIt is therefore worthwhile to look into new technologies that make\npossible new ways of becoming (or failing to become) a parent. What are\nthe implications of these technologies for the condition of women? For\nchildren?\n",
