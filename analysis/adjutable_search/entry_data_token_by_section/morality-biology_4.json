    "main_text": "Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: Explaining Morality in the Empirical Sense || Levels and Types of Explanation: Some Possibilities\n2.1 Levels and Types of Explanation: Some Possibilities\n\nIt is uncontroversial that there will be evolutionary explanations of\nsome sort for the very general capacities and tendencies in A\nand B: we are evolved creatures, and our psychological capacities,\nlike other complex capacities, are outcomes of evolutionary processes.\nBut this does not by itself settle whether these capacities and\ntendencies are themselves adaptations, having evolved through\nnatural selection because of their adaptive effects. That is the most\ncommon view (further explored below), but there are alternatives.\n\nIt is possible, for example, that our capacity to make moral judgments\nis a spin-off (side-effect or by-product) of our non-moral\nintellectual capacities, which latter are\n adaptations.[3]\n On this view, we tend to make moral judgments because we are\nintellectual and reflective creatures, not because natural selection\nhas specifically given us this moral capacity and tendency as an\nadaptation; the role of natural selection would be indirect, supplying\nmore general capacities as adaptations, from which specifically moral\ntendencies spring independently (Ayala 2006; Prinz 2008, Machery and\nMallon 2010).\n\nThe deeper point, however, is that whichever position one\ntakes on the role of natural selection in the emergence of generic\ncapacities for moral judgment, this does not settle how best to\naccount for other, more specific tendencies, such as C-F. In\nparticular:\n\nEven if (1) our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments\nis an adaptation that evolved through natural selection, it\nremains possible that (2) the content of particular moral\njudgments is derived autonomously, i.e., free from causal\nshaping by particular elements in our evolutionary background\u2014in\nroughly the way that the contents of our beliefs in physics or\nphilosophy seem to be (see section 2.4 below).\nAlternatively, even if (1*) our capacity and tendency to make\nmoral judgments is not itself an adaptation, it remains\npossible that (2*) the content of particular moral judgments\nis deeply shaped by evolved emotional dispositions that have\naffected the content of moral judgments since human beings began\nmaking them. Such emotional adaptations may thus have influenced\ncultural norms throughout history and may continue to influence our\nmoral judgments, and hence our behavior, today.\n\n\nAnd of course there are other possibilities: 1 might be combined with\n2*, or 1* might be combined with 2, and both 2 and 2* could also be\nweakened to apply only to some judgments, while others are\nexplained in other ways, as suggested earlier. There are, then, many\npossible stories to be told about the origins of our moral judgments\nand behavior.\n\nSince our concern is with morality, the crucial issue to\nbegin with is the origins of moral judgment: for morality has\nnot merely to do with certain emotions and behaviors (such as sympathy\nand altruism) as such, but with the exercise of moral\njudgment about how one ought to behave in various social\ncircumstances (Joyce 2006, ch. 2; Korsgaard 2006; Kitcher 2006c, 2011;\nMachery and Mallon 2010). Certain emotions and behaviors are then\nrelevant too insofar as they relate to the exercise of such judgment,\nbut in the absence of moral judgment they seem only to belong to\nproto-morality.\n\nStill, many discussions employ a looser notion of\n\u2018morality\u2019 that refers simply to certain kinds of socially\npositive emotion or behavior, such as psychological altruism\n(defined below). Since accounts of the origins of moral judgment rely\non these ideas as well, and these emotions or behavioral dispositions\nare also often appealed to as causal influences on the content of\nmoral judgment, it is worth starting with a look at the issue of\npsychological altruism, distinguishing it from merely biological\naltruism.\n",
