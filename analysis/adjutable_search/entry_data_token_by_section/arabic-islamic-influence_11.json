    "main_text": "Psychology || Averroes\u2019 Unicity Thesis\n5.4 Averroes\u2019 Unicity Thesis\n\nAverroes\u2019 best known philosophical doctrine holds that there is\nonly one intellect for all human beings. The doctrine is sometimes\nlabelled \u201cmonopsychism\u201d, but this is a problematic term,\nsince Averroes\u2019 unicity thesis concerns the intellect, not the\nsoul. Averroes\u2019 theory has an epistemological and an ontological\npurpose. On the one hand, Averroes wants to explain how universal\nintelligibles can be known, on the other hand, he wants to account for\nAristotle\u2019s claim that the intellect is pure potentiality and\nunmixed with the body (Comm. magnum De anima III.5). Many\nscholastic readers were troubled by the problem of whether the\nmaterial (or potential) intellect, if it is one, can be the form of\nthe body. This problem was not directly addressed by Averroes himself,\nbut by many of his Latin partisans.\n\nModern scholarship is still divided about the significance of the\ncurrent of Averroism in the thirteenth century (for the more recent\ndiscussion see Imbach 1991; Hayoun/de Libera 1991; Bianchi 1993;\nNiew\u00f6hner/Sturlese 1994; Kuksewicz 1997; Brenet 2003,\n21\u201322; Coccia 2005, 20\u201353; Hasse 2007b; Martin 2007; Calma\n2010, 11\u201320, 367\u2013373; Martin 2013; Akasoy & Giglioni 2013).\nIt was argued, for instance, that the \u201cradical\nAristotelians\u201d of the thirteenth century were not\n\u201cAverroists\u201d in a strict sense (Van Steenberghen 1974,\n531\u2013534). But that much is clear: there existed at least four\ngroups of authors who explicitly adopted the unicity thesis in one of\ntheir writings: Siger of Brabant and possibly other masters of arts in\nlater thirteenth-century Paris; a second Parisian group in the early\nfourteenth century around Thomas Wilton, John of Jandun and John\nBaconthorpe; several Italian masters of arts at Bologna university in\nthe fourteenth century; and a larger group of authors in Renaissance\nItaly and especially in Padua.\n\nWhen the medievals used the Latin term averroista, they\nreferred to authors belonging to these groups. The term\naverroista came into use in the later thirteenth century, but\non rare occasions. The first appearance, as we can see today, is in\nThomas Aquinas\u2019 treatise On the Unicity of the\nIntellect (De unitate intellectus). The additional title\nphrase contra averroistas appears only in the later\nmanuscript tradition and is unlikely to be authentic. It was in the\ndecades around 1500 that the term was used most frequently.\nAverroistae were associated mainly with the unicity thesis,\nbut also with theories about the eternity of the world, God\u2019s\nknowledge of the world, prime matter and happiness (Kuksewicz 1997,\n93\u201396; Calma 2010). In the\nRenaissance, averroista was also used, with a positive\nconnotation, to refer to experts on Averroes (Martin 2007; Martin\n2013). A sensible historiographical usage of the term\n\u201cAverroism\u201d should be tied to the medieval and Renaissance\nusages. In particular, two senses of the term \u201cAverroism\u201d\nseem historically legitimate: as meaning a current of followers of\nAverroes who hold theologically controversional doctrines, or as\nmeaning a current of experts on Averroes. The first sense has a longer\ntradition in the Middle Ages and in modern scholarship and is\ntherefore to be preferred generally. Some modern historians use the\nterm \u201cAverroism\u201d in a much broader sense for all\ninfluences of Averroes\u2019 thought (e.g. Gauthier 1982,\n334\u2013335; Calma 2010, 368\u2013369); so-called\n\u201cAverroisms\u201d would then be found, for instance, in almost\nall Latin Aristotle commentaries of the later Middle Ages. This usage,\nhowever, ignores the historical roots of the meaning of the term.\n\nSiger of Brabant (d. 1284) and John of Jandun (d. 1328) were the best\nknown and most influential Averroists. Siger, in his first and most\nexplicitly Averroistic work on the soul, argues that the separate and\neternal intellect is united to the body only in an operational union\nand that the true form of the body is the sensitive soul (Quaest.\nin tertium de anima, esp. q. 3 and 9). Under the influence of\nThomas Aquinas and others, Siger later revised his position. For John\nof Jandun, the intellective soul, which in itself is one and separate,\noperates within the body. It is united to the body only through the\nassistance of the phantasmata (Brenet 2003). The Renaissance\nAverroists Agostino Nifo and Luca Prassicio argued that Siger and John\nof Jandun professed conflicting views: they interpreted Siger as\nholding that the unique intellect can be united to the body as form\nand John of Jandun that it cannot. Another influential Averroist was\nJohn Baconthorpe (d. 1345/48): He developed the theory of the\nso-called \u201cdouble conjunction\u201d (copulatio\nbifaria) between intellect and bodily phantasms: one\nepistemological, one ontological. The ontological conjunction\npresupposes a union of unique intellect and human being in a way that\nthe intellect becomes a human faculty (Etzwiler 1971, 266\u2013269).\nAmong the most explicit and outspoken Averroists of the Renaissance\nwere Nicoletto Vernia (d. 1499) and Luca Prassicio (d. 1533). The\nunicity thesis was successful among Latin authors not only because\nAverroes as the commentator had become an exceptional\nauthority of university education, but also because it was attractive\nphilosophically: it explained the possibility of the knowledge of\nuniversals and it ensured that the intellective soul, as demanded by\nAristotle (De anima III.4, 429a22\u201325), was not mixed\nwith the body.\n\nThe unicity thesis was included among the doctrines condemned in 1270\nand 1277 in Paris (art. 32) and in 1489 in Padua by the local bishops.\nFrom a theological vantage point, its main drawback was its conflict\nwith the doctrine of individual immortality. The principal\nphilosophical counter-argument, first presented by Averroes himself\n(Comm. magnum De anima, 393) and powerfully formulated by\nThomas Aquinas, was that the unicity thesis could not account for the\nfact that \u201cthis individual man thinks\u201d, as Thomas puts it\n(\u201chic homo singularis intelligit\u201d, De unitate\nintellectus III) (Black 2004). The standard reply by Averroes and\nhis followers was that the intelligible form is joined to the\nindividual human being through the actualized imaginative form, which\nis particular. This way, individual knowledge of universal forms is\npossible.\n\nThe decades around 1500 saw the high tide of the Averroist current, as\nfar as we can discern today (Schmitt 1979; Akasoy & Giglioni\n2013). This is indicated by several pieces of evidence: the frequent\nusage of the term averroista; the significant number of\nauthors who adopt the unicity thesis in one of their works; the\ncomposition of super-commentaries on Averroes\u2019 commentaries;\nand, finally, the fact that the correct interpretation of\nAverroes\u2019 philosophical position became a matter of dispute\namong his partisans (e.g. between Nifo, Trombetta, Zimara, Pomponazzi\nand Prassicio). The unicity thesis lost its appeal as late as in the\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, with the advent of new trends of\nAristotelianism that gave alternative explanations of universal\nintellection (e.g. by Melanchthon, Zabarella and Suarez) (Hasse 2016,\nch. 5).\n",
