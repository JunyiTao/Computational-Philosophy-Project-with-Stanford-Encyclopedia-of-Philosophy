    "main_text": "Criteria for evaluating analogical arguments || Practice-based approaches\n3.6 Practice-based approaches Studies of analogical reasoning based on scientific\npractice provide valuable perspectives on criteria for evaluating\nanalogical arguments.\n\n3.6.1 Norton\u2019s material theory of analogy\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a72.4,\n Norton rejects analogical inference rules. But even if we agree with\nNorton on this point, we might still be interested in having an\naccount that gives us guidelines for evaluating analogical arguments.\nHow does Norton\u2019s approach fare on this score?\n\nAccording to Norton, each analogical argument is warranted by local\nfacts that must be investigated and justified empirically. First,\nthere is \u201cthe fact of the analogy\u201d: in practice, a\nlow-level uniformity that embraces both the source and target systems.\nSecond, there are additional factual properties of the target system\nwhich, when taken together with the uniformity, warrant the analogical\ninference. Consider Galileo\u2019s famous inference\n (Example 12)\n that there are mountains on the moon (Galileo 1610). Through his\nnewly invented telescope, Galileo observed points of light on the moon\nahead of the advancing edge of sunlight. Noting that the same thing\nhappens on earth when sunlight strikes the mountains, he concluded\nthat there must be mountains on the moon and even provided a\nreasonable estimate of their height. In this example, Norton tells us,\nthe the fact of the analogy is that shadows and other optical\nphenomena are generated in the same way on the earth and on the moon;\nthe additional fact about the target is the existence of points of\nlight ahead of the advancing edge of sunlight on the moon.\n\nWhat are the implications of Norton\u2019s material theory when it\ncomes to evaluating analogical arguments? The fact of the\nanalogy is a local uniformity that powers the inference.\nNorton\u2019s theory works well when such a uniformity is patent or\nnaturally inferred. It doesn\u2019t work well when the uniformity is\nitself the target (rather than the driver) of the\ninference. That happens with explanatory analogies such as\n Example 5\n (the Acoustical Analogy), and mathematical analogies such as\n Example 7\n (Rectangles and Boxes). Similarly, the theory doesn\u2019t\nwork well when the underlying uniformity is unclear, as in\n Example 2\n (Life on other Planets),\n Example 4\n (Clay Pots), and many other cases. In short, if\nNorton\u2019s theory is accepted, then for most analogical arguments\nthere are no useful evaluation criteria.\n3.6.2 Field-specific criteria\n\nFor those who sympathize with Norton\u2019s skepticism about\nuniversal inductive schemes and theories of analogical reasoning, yet\nrecognize that his approach may be too local, an appealing strategy is\nto move up one level. We can aim for field-specific \u201cworking\nlogics\u201d (Toulmin 1958; Wylie and Chapman 2016; Reiss 2015). This\napproach has been adopted by philosophers of archaeology, evolutionary\nbiology and other historical sciences (Wylie and Chapman 2016; Currie\n2013; Currie 2016; Currie 2018). In place of schemas, we find\n\u2018toolkits\u2019, i.e., lists of criteria for evaluating\nanalogical reasoning.\n\nFor example, Currie (2016) explores in detail the use of ethnographic\nanalogy\n (Example 13)\n between shamanistic motifs used by the contemporary San people and\nsimilar motifs in ancient rock art, found both among ancestors of the\nSan (direct historical analogy) and in European rock art (indirect\nhistorical analogy). Analogical arguments support the hypothesis that\nin each of these cultures, rock art symbolizes hallucinogenic\nexperiences. Currie examines criteria that focus on assumptions about\nstability of cultural traits and environment-culture relationships.\nCurrie (2016, 2018) and Wylie (Wylie and Chapman 2016) also stress the\nimportance of robustness reasoning that combines analogical arguments\nof moderate strength with other forms of evidence to yield strong\nconclusions.\n\nPractice-based approaches can thus yield specific guidelines unlikely\nto be matched by any general theory of analogical reasoning. One\ncaveat is worth mentioning. Field-specific criteria for ethnographic\nanalogy are elicited against a background of decades of methodological\ncontroversy (Wylie and Chapman 2016). Critics and defenders of\nethnographic analogy have appealed to general models of scientific\nmethod (e.g., hypothetico-deductive method or Bayesian confirmation).\nTo advance the methodological debate, practice-based approaches must\neither make connections to these general models or explain why the\nlack of any such connection is unproblematic.\n3.6.3 Formal analogies in physics\n\nClose attention to analogical arguments in practice can also provide\nvaluable challenges to general ideas about analogical inference. In an\ninteresting discussion, Steiner (1989, 1998) suggests that many of the\nanalogies that played a major role in early twentieth-century physics\ncount as \u201cPythagorean.\u201d The term is meant to connote\nmathematical mysticism: a \u201cPythagorean\u201d analogy is a\npurely formal analogy, one founded on mathematical similarities that\nhave no known physical basis at the time it is proposed. One example\nis Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s use of analogy\n (Example 14)\n to \u201cguess\u201d the form of the relativistic wave equation. In\nSteiner\u2019s view, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s reasoning relies upon\nmanipulations and substitutions based on purely mathematical\nanalogies. Steiner argues that the success, and even the plausibility,\nof such analogies \u201cevokes, or should evoke, puzzlement\u201d\n(1989: 454). Both Hesse (1966) and Bartha (2010) reject the idea that\na purely formal analogy, with no physical significance, can support a\nplausible analogical inference in physics. Thus, Steiner\u2019s\narguments provide a serious challenge.\n\nBartha (2010) suggests a response: we can decompose Steiner\u2019s\nexamples into two or more steps, and then establish that at least one\nstep does, in fact, have a physical basis. Fraser (forthcoming),\nhowever, offers a counterexample that supports Steiner\u2019s\nposition. Complex analogies between classical statistical mechanics\n(CSM) and quantum field theory (QFT) have played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment and application of renormalization group (RG) methods in\nboth theories\n (Example 15).\n Fraser notes substantial physical disanalogies between CSM and QFT,\nand concludes that the reasoning is based entirely on formal\nanalogies.\n",
