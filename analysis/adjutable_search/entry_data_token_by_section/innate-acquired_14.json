    "main_text": "Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals || Innateness as genetic specification\n3.1 Innateness as genetic specification\n\nAccording to our intuitive or \u201cfolk\u201d conception of\ninnateness, a trait qualifies as innate if it is either typical of\nmost members of the species, or if it is developmentally buffered\nagainst certain environmental factors, or if it is an evolutionary\nadaptation (Griffiths, et al. 2009). It might be argued that all three\nof these properties are coextensive with traits that are genetically\nspecified: 1. Species-typicality is explained, on this view, by the\nfact that members of each species share a common pool of genes. 2.\nSome genes are developmentally buffered against certain environmental\nfactors, such that within some range of variation those factors do not\nimpact the expression of those genes. 3. Finally, many biologists see\nthe gradual accumulation of genetic mutations as the primary mechanism\nallowing phenotypes to undergo evolutionary adaptation. Putting these\nideas together, it might seem plausible to cash out the folk\nconception of innateness in terms of genetic information. More\nprecisely, a trait could be described as more or less innate depending\non the extent to which its development is guided by genetic\ninformation. One potential advantage of this analysis is that it can\nmake sense of the dispositional nature of certain \u201cinnate\u201d\ntraits. Many traits have a late developmental onset, such as those\nassociated with puberty in humans. Their developmental fixity, their\nspecies typicality, and their functionality can lead people to judge\nthese traits as \u201cinnate\u201d despite not being present early\nin life. This judgment makes sense if innate traits are those which\nare genetically specified, since the genetic predisposition to develop\ncertain characters is present in the organism from conception.\n\nDespite these apparent advantages, most philosophers reject this\nproposal. As Elliott Sober (1988; 2000) points out, when speaking\nabout a particular trait in a particular organism \u2013 such as the\nreader\u2019s own height \u2013 it makes no sense to ask how much of\nthat individual trait was determined by genes and how much by the\nenvironment. All traits require both genetic and environmental factors\nfor their development. Thus, one cannot isolate these causal factors\nin a way that would allow for the comparison of their relative\nphenotypic contributions. We cannot ask, for example, how an organism\nwould develop in an \u201cenvironmental vacuum\u201d because it\nwould not develop at all. Sober further notes that genetic and\nenvironmental contributions are incommensurable. If you are six feet\ntall, we cannot sensibly ask how much of your height came from your\ngenes and how much came from your environment. There are no\n\u201cheight particles\u201d produced by both genes and environments\nthat add up to determine your height (Sober 1988). Genes and\nenvironment both make contributions, but not contributions that can be\ntaken apart and then weighed separately. Yet the folk concept of\ninnateness clearly applies to particular traits in particular\nindividuals: Donald Trump\u2019s eyes are innately grey-blue but his\nskin is not innately orange. Such statements cannot be meaningfully\ntranslated into statements about the relative contributions of genes\nend environment to Trump\u2019s eyes or Trump\u2019s skin.\n\nThe scientific discipline that does meaningfully address questions of\nthe relative contributions of genes and environment is quantitative\ngenetics. It does so by shifting its focus from the individual to the\npopulation. Instead of investigating individuals, quantitative\ngeneticists focus on populations comprised of genetically\nvariable individuals. Instead of asking how genetic and environmental\nfactors influence the development of an individual, this discipline\nfocuses on how each factor influences phenotypic differences\nin a population. It is important to understand how this focus on\npopulation-level phenotypic differences impacts judgments about\nwhether a given trait is \u201cgenetic.\u201d An obvious limitation\nof this approach is that it can be applied only to traits that exhibit\nphenotypic variation. Take some trait that is invariant, such as all\nhumans having one head. Without variation in this trait, it is not\npossible to conduct a population-level analysis to determine the\nextent to which this trait is genetically encoded. There are no\nphenotypic differences at the population level, and so no\ndistinguishable genetic contribution to those differences (see\n SEP entry\n on heritability). This is, again, at odds with our vernacular notion\nof innateness, which would surely judge the human head to be an innate\ntrait. Indeed, typicality (or invariance) is one of the driving\nfactors in folk judgments of innateness (Griffiths, et al. 2009), so\nthe conventional scientific method for evaluating genetic\ncontributions to trait development is at odds with our folk intuitions\nfor this reason alone.\n\nAnother implication of this approach is that judgments about the\nmagnitudes of genetic vs environmental contributions are relative to a\nspecific population and to a particular environment. Changing either\none of these contextual factors can alter the extent to which some\ntrait is deemed genetic. For example, suppose that a quantitative\ngeneticist is interested in growing large corn plants. She sets out to\ncompare two different corn genotypes (G1 and G2) across two different\nfertilizer treatments (E1 and E2). Suppose that G2 grows larger than\nG1 by exactly 5 units in both E1 and E2. This would lead our\nresearcher to conclude that the observed variation in corn height is\ndue entirely to genetic differences. We might further infer that the\ntrait of height in corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic\nthan by environmental factors. However, this judgment is contingent on\nthe comparison class that our researcher has chosen. Imagine another\nscenario in which G2 is compared to yet another genotype (G3). This\ntime, our researcher compares E2 to E3, a third fertilizer treatment\ndistinct from E1. Further suppose that G2 and G3 grow to the same\nheight in E2, but that G3 is five units larger than G2 in E3. In this\ncase, a comparison based on population differences suggests that the\nfocal trait is more strongly influenced by environmental than by\ngenetic factors. Let us now focus just on G2 in E2, and ask whether\nheight in these corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic or\nenvironmental factors? Sober (1988) uses a similar example to\nillustrate that any answer to this question is contingent on the\ncomparison class one chooses. If we compare G2/E2 to G1/E1, then\nheight differences come out as genetically influenced; but if we\ncompare G2/E2 to G3/E3, then height differences come out as\nenvironmentally influenced. Hence, judgments about the relative\nmagnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions are\ninherently \u201cnon-local\u201d or context sensitive.\n\nSome philosophers take this as sufficient grounds for rejecting any\nanalysis of innateness in terms of genetic contributions (e.g. Khalidi\n2007). The worry is that there is no canonical comparison class for\nevaluating the relative contributions of genetic and environmental\ninfluences. Different researchers will select different alleles and\ndifferent environments for investigating a given trait and there is no\nnon-arbitrary way to determine which is the \u201ccorrect\u201d\ncomparison class. Insofar as innateness is not a context sensitive\nconcept, but the magnitude of genetic contribution is highly context\nsensitive, innateness cannot be defined as magnitude of genetic\ncontribution. One way to potentially avoid this implication is by\nspecifying a canonical or \u201cnormal\u201d range of environments.\nIn this view, a trait is relatively innate to the extent that genetic\n(as opposed to environmental) factors explain phenotypic differences\nacross the normal range of environments. This proposal will be\nconsidered more carefully in the following section (Section 3.2)\nInterested readers might refer to entries on\n Gene\n and\n Biological Information).\n\nAnother way to potentially avoid the context-sensitivity objection is\nto develop some other method of quantifying genetic vs environmental\ncontributions to phenotypes. We saw earlier (Section 1) that Lorenz\nattempted to define innate traits in terms of the extent to which they\nare encoded by genetic information. This proposal places\nemphasis on the concept of information and whether it is possible to\ncompare traits according to the relative amounts to which they are\nstructured by genetic information. A general problem with this\napproach is that genes do not contain information about traits,\nstrictly speaking. As Peter Godfrey-Smith has noted, \u2018All the\ngenes can code for, if they code for anything, is the primary\nstructure (amino acid sequence) of a protein\u2019 (Godfrey-Smith\n1999, 328). Considered as a language, the genetic code can only refer\nto the twenty-three standard amino acids and can only say which order\nto put them in. The only exceptions to this are the\n\u2018start\u2019 and \u2018stop\u2019 codons which affect where\nDNA transcription begins and ends. Many other things happen as a\ndownstream causal consequence of the order of amino acids, but to\nparaphrase Godfrey Smith\u2019s argument, genes do not \u2018code\nfor\u2019 these downstream causal consequences for the same reason\nthat President Nixon\u2019s order to cover up the Watergate scandal\nwas not an \u2018order\u2019 to get himself impeached by Congress.\n\u2018Coding for\u2019, like \u2018ordering\u2019 and other\nsemantic locutions, is not merely another name for\n\u2018causing\u2019. The idea that the \u2018genetic program\u2019\nor \u2018genetic instructions\u2019 for phenotypes are literally\nwritten in the genetic code is a continuing barrier to the public\nunderstanding of genetics, one that is reinforced every time a\njournalist reports that scientists have \u2018decoded\u2019 the gene\nfor something. In reality there are no tiny \u2018traitunculi\u2019\nhidden in the genome awaiting a sufficiently powerful genetic\nmicroscope to read them (Schaffner 1998, 2016).\n\nBut although the sequences of nucleotides in the genome do not\nliterally \u2018code for\u2019 phenotypic traits, they are, of\ncourse, amongst the causes of phenotypic traits. Several philosophers\nand scientists have introduced technical definitions of \u2018genetic\ninformation\u2019 based on these causal relationships in order to\nexplicate the intuitive idea that genes carry information about\nphenotypes. These proposals are discussed in more detail in the entry\n Biological information.\n Here we will simply make two points about these proposals. The first\npoint is that there are some very straightforward senses in which\ngenes \u2018carry information\u2019 about phenotypes. The human Y\nchromosome carries information about sex in the same way that\n\u2018smoke means fire\u2019: one can be predicted from the other.\nIn addition, the SRY region on the Y-chromosome is an adaptation for\nmaking organisms into males, so we can apply a version of\n\u2018teleosemantics\u2019, an approach which defines information in\nterms of adaptation, to this piece of DNA (Sterelny, et al. 1996; Shea\n2007 and see the entry on\n Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n The second point is that these straightforward senses of\n\u2018information\u2019 also seem to be applicable to environmental\ncauses in development (Oyama 1985; Griffiths and Gray 2005). Mammals\nhave a chromosomal system of sex-determination. But many reptiles use\ntemperature, an environmental signal, to switch genetically identical\neggs between male or female developmental pathways. Other reptiles\nhave a genetic system which can be overridden by an environmental\nsignal. Some fish even switch sex in adulthood in response to\nenvironmental cues. These environmental signals carry information\nabout sex in the same unproblematic \u2018smoke means fire\u2019\nsense as the SRY gene. Moreover, the behaviors that parents use to\ngive appropriate cues to their eggs, and some of the products of those\nbehaviors, such as nests of rotting vegetation which maintain a\nsuitable temperature range, are designed by natural selection to\nensure the correct sex-ratio in offspring, so the teleosemantic\nprogram can be applied to them too. The idea that genes \u2018carry\ninformation\u2019 about phenotypes in a special sense which\ndistinguishes them from other causes is not the piece of common-sense\nit is often taken to be, but rather a highly contested idea that is\nthe focus of much work in the philosophy of biology.
