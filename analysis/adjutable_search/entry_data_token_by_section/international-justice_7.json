    "main_text": "The New Cosmopolitanism and Beyond || Pure Egalitarianism\n4.1 Pure Egalitarianism\n\nThe dispute between left and right institutionalism has centered on\nhow to interpret the institutions found at the global level; both\nsides in the debate agreed that the nature of these institutions is of\nprimary importance in establishing whether or not egalitarian duties\nhold globally. Some recent theorists, however, have challenged this\nassumption. On this vision, what is relevant from the standpoint of\njustice is only whether or not a particular agent is, in fact, a\nrecognizably human agent\u2014not whether that agent stands in a\nparticular relationship as regards other humans. Simon Caney is a\nchief exponent of this theoretical perspective, and defends it as\nfollows:\n\n\nConsider a world with two separate systems of interaction that have no\ncontact but are aware of each other and suppose that one of them is\nprosperous whereas the other is extremely impoverished. Compare, now,\ntwo individuals\u2014one from the prosperous system and one from the\nimpoverished system\u2014who are identical in their abilities and\nneeds. The member of the prosperous system receives more. But it is\ndifficult to see why\u2014concentrating on any possible and\nreasonable criteria for entitlement\u2014this is fair. Ex\nhypothesi, she is not more hard-working or more gifted or more\nneedy. In all respects they are identical (bar one, namely that one is\nlucky to live in the prosperous society and one is not) and yet an\ninstitutionalist approach confers on one many more benefits. Moreover,\nit does so wholly arbitrarily because there is no ground on which the\nmember of the prosperous society can claim to be entitled to more.\n(Caney 2005: 111; see also Tan 2004)\n\n\nOther cosmopolitans have echoed this conclusion, while grounding it in\na broader theory of ethics. Kok-Chor Tan, for instance, argues that\nany global order that allows economic inequality to rest upon\narbitrary facts can be rejected as unjust:\n\n\nThe ideas of state sovereignty and the territorial integrity of states\npresume a global institutional order that grants these ideas a certain\nmoral standing, as claims that others should respect. But this respect\nis achievable only if the global order is not one that persons subject\nto it can reasonably reject. My claim is that a global order that\nturns arbitrariness about persons into differential personal\nadvantages is one that some can reasonably reject. (Tan 2012: 159)\n\n\nThese conclusions are echoed by Pablo Gilabert, who uses the notion of\nreasonable rejection to argue for a \u201chumanist\negalitarianism\u201d, on which principles of distributive justice\napply simply in virtue of status as human:\n\n\nTo say that some but not all humans are entitled to [economic]\nadvantages would seem, on the face of it, morally arbitrary. It would\nfail to show equal concern and respect for all\u2026 Any conception\nof global distribution that gives some human beings less access to the\nimportant advantages identified [above] than it gives to others is one\nthat the former have reason to reject. (Gilabert 2012:\n196\u201397)\n\n\nThis form of egalitarianism has some undisputed attractions. It keeps\nthe moral attention focused on human persons, which is\u2014we might\nagree\u2014right where it ought to be. It is compatible, moreover,\nwith a variety of different theories of what might be the appropriate\nmetric with which to demonstrate our egalitarian respect; Caney argues\nthat a global principle of equality of opportunity is likely superior\nto one based upon resources (Caney 2001). It is compatible, moreover,\nwith the institutions we have developed being relevant from the\nstandpoint of justice, insofar as they help or hinder efforts to live\nup to the demands of global equality. It insists, in the end, only\nthat such institutions are at most helpful tools, rather than\nfoundational forms of human relationship that give rise to distinct\nmoral duties.\n\nThe problem with this form of egalitarianism, however, is that\ncomparatively few of us are prepared to take distributive equality as\na foundational value; most of us believe that distributive equality is\nrelevant only within certain relational contexts, as a way of\nguaranteeing that individuals are not dominated or marginalized within\nthose relationships (Anderson 1999; Altman & Wellman 2009). To say\nthat equality is itself a value seems to ascribe a fundamental moral\nimportance to relative income shares\u2014an importance that seems,\nat the very least, somewhat in need of defense . Return once again to\nthe example of Atlantis. Imagine that the world were made fully just,\naccording to whatever conception of justice you require, and that the\nisland of Atlantis then rose into that just world; imagine further\nthat every Atlantean were possessed of a small quantity of diamonds,\nwhich made them significantly more wealthy than the average person.\nWould the Atlanteans have the duty, simply in virtue of common\nhumanity, to redistribute their diamonds, so as to ensure equality?\nThe answer, for a pure egalitarian, must be yes; this answer, however,\nseems to say that what was a just world has now become unjust, simply\nbecause we are made aware of others doing better for themselves than\nwe are (Blake 2012). This particular vision of egalitarianism depends\nupon an ideal of quality that many people\u2014including both right\nand left Rawlsians\u2014have regarded as deeply problematic.\n",
