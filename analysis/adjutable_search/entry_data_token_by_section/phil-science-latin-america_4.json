Concluding Remarks\n\nAfter reviewing the development of philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica since its emergence in the mid-twentieth century, it can be\nsaid that there are some distinctive features in different countries.\nBut in the last decades, especially given the widespread use of the\nInternet and digital libraries by the mid-1990s, a growing\nintercommunication and collaboration can be verified as well as the\ntendency to form an academic community with an important international\npresence, which, at the same time, has certain characteristics of its\nown. Among the common features, the following deserve to be\nmentioned.\n\n In general, in Latin American countries, the philosophy of\nscience began to be cultivated in the mid-twentieth century in those\nacademic circles that were favorable to analytic philosophy,\nunderstood in a broad sense. The so-called \u201cphilosophical\nanalysis\u201d, more than a school or doctrinal body, represented in\nLatin America an alternative way of doing philosophy: in this trend,\nthe methodological demands of conceptual elucidation and argumentative\nrigor supported a reaction against the metaphysical, speculative, or\ndogmatic traditions that predominated in the 1940s. Thus, analytic\nphilosophy favored the focus on problems posed in the fields of logic,\nscience, and language (without restricting the analysis of the latter\nto ordinary language). Based on this common root, since the 1960s\nphilosophy of science has acquired a place of its own in most\ncountries of the region.\n Although the \u201cAmericanist\u201d concern (understood as the\nsearch for a philosophy of the region, with its own identity) did not\nprevail in philosophy of science of Latin America, the constant and\ngrowing exchange between Latin American philosophers of science has\nhad the result of generating lines of research that integrate the\nconcerns for the social problems afflicting the countries of the\nregion and the role that science and technology can play in its\nsolution. Thus, from the 1990s, a triple movement was generated:\norientation towards practical issues, openness to other philosophical\ntraditions\u2014different from the analytic tradition\u2014and a\ndirect connection between the main Latin American nuclei where\nphilosophy of science is developed.\n At the turn of the century, a vigorous growth of the \nphilosophy of particular sciences can be observed, especially the\nphilosophy of physics and biology, and more recently the philosophy of\ncognitive sciences. The philosophy of chemistry\u2014a field that had\nbeen ignored all over the world until 1980\u2014has only recently\nbegun to be cultivated in countries such as Argentina and Mexico. In\ncontrast, in philosophy of the social sciences, Latin America shows an\nunequal growth compared to the philosophy of the natural sciences.\nDespite this, it can be said that a sustained effort is being made to\npromote areas such as the philosophy of psychology, sociology, and\neconomics. Furthermore, the philosophy of formal sciences has advanced\nsignificantly.\n Regarding philosophy of technology, it received very little\nattention until the end of the last century. However, the frequent\ninteraction with the Spanish philosophers of technology, through their\nparticipation in specialized meetings and their collaboration in\ngraduate programs, has favored the cultivation of this research axis\nin close connection with the critical reflection on the relationships\nbetween technology and the economic, social, and environmental\nproblems afflicting the region.\n Regarding general philosophy of science, its development shows a\nremarkable diversification in Latin America. In a relatively short\nperiod of time\u2014which started in the late 1980s\u2014there has\nbeen a growing expansion of problems, approaches, and lines of\nresearch. Even the discussion of great classical problems, such as\nrationality and realism, is carried out from alternative perspectives,\nmany of which have recovered the naturalist approach of classical\npragmatists, which in the 1960s gained a new impetus under the\nso-called \u201cHistoricist turn\u201d. On the other hand, this\nstrong tendency to develop a naturalized philosophy of science has\nbeen accompanied by the defense of markedly pluralist positions, both\nin the methodological as well as the epistemological and ontological\nfields. All of this points to a conception of philosophical work that,\nwithout neglecting argumentative rigor and conceptual elucidation,\ndeals with and worries about the problems of its context and\nhistorical moment. In the philosophy of science, this has been\nreflected in a growing awareness of the need to rethink the\nrelationships among science, technology, and society, along with its\nethical, political, economic, environmental, and gender\ndimensions.\n By way of conclusion, it should be noted that, in contrast to the\nway in which philosophy of science has developed in the Anglo-Saxon\nsphere, works in Latin America have moved much more rapidly from the\nmerely \u201cacademic\u201d stage, where discussions revolve around\nwhat other colleagues (classical or contemporary) have proposed, to\nthe stage of critical reflection on the problems of broader social\nenvironment in which scientific activity takes place. However, it\nshould also be noted that this expansion of horizons has not affected\nnegatively the research on the central problems of the discipline\n(logical, semantic, methodological, pragmatic, epistemological, and\nontological) which continue to be the core of the curriculum of the\nspecialized degree programs, as well as of the research centers where\nphilosophy of science is developed.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth stressing that the area strongly progressed in\nspite of the many obstacles that philosophical research faces in the\nregion; the erratic political situation and the cyclic economic crisis\nin Latin American countries influence research policies, and this\nplaces scholars in unstable and uncertain positions.  Nevertheless,\nregardless of the difficulties, at present a new generation of young\nphilosophers of science allows us to foresee that the philosophy of\nscience produced in Latin America will continue to grow in quantity\nand quality, increasing its already considerable international\npresence.\n",
