    "main_text": "The Exegetical Labor on the De anima\n5. The Exegetical Labor on the De anima\n\nThe impression that, from very early on, the interpreters were\nstruggling to understand Aristotle is confirmed by the commentary\ntradition on the De anima. Consider, for example, De\nanima 3.5. There, Aristotle famously argues for the existence of\nan intellect that is separate, unaffected, and unmixed (De\nanima 430 a 17\u201318). In antiquity commentators traditionally\nreferred to this intellect as the active (or productive) intellect,\nnous poi\u00eatikos. Discussion on how exactly this\nintellect is to be understood started very early. There is evidence\nthat already Theophrastus puzzled over it (Themistius, In De\nanima 110.18\u201328). Among other things, it is not obvious\nwhat sort of thing the active intellect is supposed to be. More\ndirectly, it is not clear whether it is a human or a divine intellect.\nWhat Aristotle says outside of the De anima is equally\nperplexing. In his work On the Generation of Animals\nAristotle speaks of an intellect that enters \u201cfrom\nwithout\u201d (736 b 27). But it is not at all clear how the comment\nthat Aristotle makes in this context is to be understood. What exactly\nis the status of this enigmatic intellect? How does it fit with the\ndiscussion offered in the De anima?\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias developed a line of interpretation that made\nthe active intellect a non-human intellect and identified it with God.\nHis commentary on the De anima is lost. Instead we have the\nDe anima that he wrote following the principles that\nAristotle had established in his own De anima. There,\nAlexander identifies the active intellect with \u201cthe first cause,\nwhich is the cause and principle of existence to all the other\nthings\u201d (Alexander, De anima 89. 9\u201310). The\nintellect so understood is not only the cause of human thought; it is\nalso the cause of the existence of everything that there is in the\nuniverse. This intellect can also be an object of thought. When this\nhappens, this intellect enters in us from without: \u201cthis is the\nintellect from without which comes to be in us and is\nimperishable\u201d (Alexander, De anima 90.19\u201320).\nAlexander makes it abundantly clear that this intellect alone is\nimperishable and as such it is also divine. A similar but not\nidentical attempt to expand on the elliptical remarks that Aristotle\nhas left on the active intellect can be found in the On\nIntellect, a short essay attributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias\nand preserved in the collection of brief exegetical writings known to\nus as Mantissa.\n\nAnother text that has important implications for the reception of\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of the intellect is the paraphrase of the\nDe anima that Themistius wrote around 350 CE. There,\nThemistius argues that the active intellect is the most accurate\nspecification of the human form (In De anima\n100.35\u201336). Put differently, our essence as human beings is the\nactive intellect (In De anima 100.36\u2013101.1). Although\nThemistius does not name names, he is clearly reacting against the\nreading advanced by Alexander of Aphrodisias. For Themistius the\nactive intellect is not God or the supreme principle upon which\neverything depends for its existence. For him, the active intellect is\nan integral part of the human soul: \u201cthe active intellect is in\nthe soul and it is like the most honourable part of the human\nsoul\u201d (In De anima 103.4\u20135). Although the active\nintellect so understood is a human intellect, it is emphatically not\nconceived of as a personal intellect. Themistius is adamantly clear\nthat there is only one separate, unmixed, and unaffected active\nintellect. Likewise, there is only one separate, unmixed, and\nunaffected potential intellect, nous dunamei. According to\nThemistius, both the active and the potential intellects are not\nsubject to generation and perishing. What is perishable is only the\ncommon or passive intellect, koinon or path\u00eatikos\nnous. This third intellect is mixed with the body and its fate is\nto perish along with the body (In De anima 105.28\u201329;\n106.14\u201315).\n",
