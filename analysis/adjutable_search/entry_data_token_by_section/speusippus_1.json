    "main_text": "Epistemology\n2. Epistemology\n\nAristotle says, in Posterior Analytics II 13.\n97a6\u201311:\n\n\nThere is no need for one who is defining and dividing to know all the\nthings that are. And yet some say that it is impossible to know the\ndifferences between something and each other thing while one does not\nknow each other thing, and without the differences one cannot know\neach thing, for a thing is the same as that from which it does not\ndiffer, and it is other than that from which it differs. \n\n\nThe ancient commentators (see esp. Anonymous In An. post.\n584.17\u2013585.2, where the ascription is credited to Eudemus) tell\nus that this is Speusippus\u2019 position (it has antecedents in Plato,\nPhilebus 18c and Theaetetus 208c-e).\n\nIt is a version of what is sometimes called \u2018holism\u2019:\nknowing something involves knowing where it is located among\neverything else. In this particular context, knowing a thing appears\nto be a matter of knowing its definition, and its definition is\nsomething arrived at by the Platonic method of division (there is room\nfor controversy here: see Falcon 2000). An example suggested by what\nAristotle says elsewhere in this same chapter (96a24-b1, much\nsimplified) might be an attempt to define the number 3 as follows:\n\n\n(Dtriad) a triad =df a number, odd, prime \n\n\nWe reach this definition by successive divisions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then the view being ascribed to Speusippus is that knowing the\nnumber 3 is knowing where 3 is on such a grid, along with knowing\nwhere every other number on the grid is.\n\nIt is very difficult to imagine sustaining this epistemological\nholism. It might seem easier if we confined the view to things like\nmathematics. But we already know that Speusippus\u2019 universe extended\nbeyond the realm of mathematical objects, and it seems quite likely\nthat another division suggested by Aristotle in that chapter\n(96b30\u201335) would be acceptable (at least in principle) to\nSpeusippus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulty of sustaining the idea that knowing man is a\nmatter of knowing its position on a tree that locates absolutely every\nanimal, or even every ensouled thing, or (worse yet) absolutely\neverything, is enormous. But it looks as if Speusippus would have been\ncommitted to this.\n\nFor we find this in Sextus Empiricus, Adversus mathematicos\nvii 145\u2013146 (Bury 1935 pp. 80, 81):\n\n\n\u2026 but Speusippus said that, since of things some are\nperceptible and others intelligible, the criterion of the intelligible\nones is the scientific account, and that of the perceptible ones is\nthe scientific perception. Scientific perception he understood to be\nthat which partakes of the truth in accordance with the account. For\njust as the fingers of the flautist or harpist have an artistic\nactuality, yet one that is not completed in them in the first\ninstance, but perfected on the basis of discipline conforming to\nreasoning, and as the perception of the musician has an actuality that\ncan grasp what is in tune and what is out of tune, and this is not\nself-grown but comes about on the basis of reasoning, so also the\nscientific perception partakes of its scientific practice as naturally\nderived from the account, leading to the unerring discrimination of\nthe subjects.\n\n\nThe use of the word \u2018scientific\u2019 should not lead one away\nfrom the main point: it translates a word that means \u2018pertaining\nto knowledge\u2019, and Speusippus is claiming that there is\nknowledge at the level of perceived objects. There is no indication\nthat he gave up his holism at this point. So he seems to be committed\nto defending a rather drastic position.\n\nAnd he seems to have pursued knowledge at the level of perceived\nobjects with considerable zeal. We have book-titles such as\nDefinitions and Likes in which Speusippus apparently\nattempted with some zeal to locate various species of plants and\nanimals on something like a division-tree, although the details are\nnot extant. What we hear about Speusippus\u2019 efforts is, for\nexample:\n\n\nMARSHWORTS: Speusippus in book II of Likes says they grow in\nwater, their leaf resembling marsh celery. (Athenaeus II 61c; Gulick\n1927 pp. 266, 267.)\n\nSpeusippus in the Likes calls the melon a\n\u2018gourd\u2019. (Athenaeus II 68e; Gulick 1927 pp. 298, 299.)\n\nSpeusippus in book II of Likes says that trumpet-shells,\npurple-fish, snails, and clams are similar. \u2026 Again, Speusippus\nenumerates next in order, in a separate division, clams, scallops,\nmussels, pinnas, razorfish, and in another class oysters, limpets.\n(Athenaeus III 86c,d; Gulick 1927 pp. 372, 273.)\n\nSpeusippus in book II of Likes says that, of the soft-shells,\nthe crayfish, lobster, mollusc, bear-crab, crab, paguros are\nsimilar. (Athenaeus III 105b; Gulick 1927 pp. 450, 451.)\n\n\nThere are a total of twenty-five such citations in Athenaeus. Most\nsimply record that Speusippus said one organism was like another (as\nwith the last two), or simply record differences of terminology that\nhappened to catch Athenaeus\u2019 eye (as with the second one). The only\none that promises anything more is the first one above, and that\nhardly promises much. But it has been supposed (see Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nthat it implies that Speusippus differentiated species of animals on\nthe basis of features that would not have counted as differentiae in\nAristotle\u2019s way of classifying animals: differences of locale. And it\nis certainly possible that Speusippus\u2019 holism involved a rejection of\nAristotle\u2019s essence-accident distinction: if we take the text quoted\nabove from Aristotle as implying that someone who knows marshworts\nmust know every respect in which they are like or unlike every other\norganism in the universe, and every such differentiating feature is as\ngood as any other in defining them, then we have abandoned the project\nof differentiating organisms as it appeared to Aristotle.\n\nThis line of thought has suggested to some (see Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nthat the criticism of the Method of Division in Aristotle\u2019s Parts\nof Animals I 2\u20133 constitutes a criticism of Speusippus.\nThis possibility remains highly controversial.\n\nIt appears from Simplicius\u2019 Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (Kalbfleisch 1907 38.19\u201324) that Speusippus\napplied his method of division, however it worked, to language: there\nwe hear of a division of terms even more elaborate than Aristotle\u2019s in\nthe opening chapter of the Categories: there we hear of\nhomonyms, synonyms, and paronyms, but Speusippus differentiated\nbetween tautonyms (uses of the same term), within which there are\nhomonyms (same term but different definitions) and synonyms (same term\nand same definition), and heteronyms (different terms), within which\nthere are heteronyms proper (different names, different things),\npolyonyms (many names, the same thing), and paronyms (as in Aristotle:\ndifferent terms and different things, with one term derivative from\nanother, as \u2018courageous\u2019 and \u2018courage\u2019).\nWhether this classification was not only more elaborate than\nAristotle\u2019s, but also had a different basis (that in Aristotle being a\nclassification of things according to how they are referred to, that\nin Speusippus being a classification of terms themselves), is in\ndispute (Barnes 1971, Tar\u00e1n 1978).\n\nFinally, we know a little bit about Speusippus\u2019 attitude toward the\nepistemology of mathematics. Assuming that Aristotle in\nMetaphysics XIV 3. 1090a25\u201329, 35-b1 is discussing\nSpeusippus (he is talking about \u201cthose who say there is only the\nmathematical number\u201d), Speusippus held that the truths of\nmathematics are not about perceptible things, and that the axioms from\nwhich they follow \u201cfawn on the soul\u201d: that is, perhaps,\nsuggest themselves. And Proclus tells us this (Commentary on Book\nI of Euclid\u2019s Elements, Friedlein 1873 p. 179.8\u201322; Morrow\n1970 p. 141):\n\n\nFor universally, Speusippus says, of the things for which the\nunderstanding is making a hunt, some it puts forward without having\nmade an elaborate excursion, and sets them up for the investigation to\ncome: it has a clearer contact with these, even more than sight has\nwith visible things; but with others, which it is unable to grasp\nstraight off, but against which it makes its strides by inference, it\ntries to effect their capture along the lines of what follows.\n\n\nSo we begin from some sort of intuition by which the axioms suggest\nthemselves and proceed from them to the rest of the mathematical\ntruths.\n\nWe also hear from Proclus of a dispute in the Academy between some,\nwhom we might call \u2018constructivists\u2019, who saw mathematics\nas something like a human construct, and referred to the truths of\ngeometry as \u2018problems\u2019, demanding geometrical\nconstructions, and others, whom we might think of as\n\u2018mathematical realists\u2019, who saw mathematics as describing\nan eternal, unchanging realm of objects, and referred to the truths of\nmathematics as \u2018theorems\u2019 or \u2018objects of\ncontemplation\u2019. Proclus says (Friedlein 1873 pp.\n77.15\u201378.6; Morrow 1970 pp. 63\u201364):\n\n\nBut already among the ancients, some demanded that we call all of the\nthings that follow from the principles theorems, as did Speusippus,\nAmphinomus, and those around them, thinking that for the theoretical\nbranches of knowledge the appellation \u2018theorems\u2019 was more\nappropriate than \u2018problems\u2019, especially in that they make\ntheir accounts about eternal things. For there is no coming-to-be\namong the eternal things, so that the problem could have no place with\nthem, it requiring a coming-to-be and making of that which was not\nbefore, e.g. constructing an equilateral triangle or describing a\nsquare when a line is given, or placing a line at a given point. So\nthey say it is better to say that all these things are, but that we\nlook at their comings-to-be not by way of producing them but by way of\nknowing them, treating the things that always are as if they were\ncoming-to-be. \n\n\nSo Speusippus, as we might have predicted from the foregoing, was\nfirmly in the realist camp.\n\n",
