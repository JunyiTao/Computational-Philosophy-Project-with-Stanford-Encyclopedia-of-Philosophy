    "main_text": "Interpretation and the Fullness of Language\n3. Interpretation and the Fullness of Language\n\nOn this basis Ricoeur\u2019s work after The Conflict of\nInterpretations addressed a number of related topics. On one\nlevel, he explored the practice of methods of interpretation as an arc\nleading from an initial situation and understanding to broadened\nunderstanding, both of the interpreter and the world as a world we can\nimagine ourselves as inhabiting. On a second level, he explored the\nbroader notion of the fullness of language through investigation of\ndifferent forms of extended discourse. These are uses of language that\nare longer than a single sentence and whose truth and meaning is not\nsimply reducible to the sum of the truth values of the individual\nsentences which make up such extended discourse. On the basis of these\ntwo interwoven levels, he could also take up the questions of selfhood\nand responsible human action, allowing him to spell out in greater\ndetail the ethical theory that had always been implicit in his\nphilosophy. His discussion of ethics starts from a focus on person to\nperson relations, the self and just one or only a few nearby others,\ncharacterized in the best case by solicitude for the other person and\nthe possibility of friendship, then subsequently moved on to the\nquestion of justice and living with others beyond those we may meet\nevery day or face to face. Here the question of rights and respect for\nthe faceless other arises. The specific question what is a just\nrelation in such situations (The Just, 2000; Reflections\non the Just, 2007), developed out of Ricoeur\u2019s\nparticipation in a seminar for judges, and led to his reflections in\nthe last work published during his lifetime on the idea of mutual\nrecognition (The Course of Recognition, 2005). In those final\nyears, he also continued to explore other dimensions of the fullness\nof language, for example, through some significant essays on the\nnotion of translation as occurring not just between languages but also\nwithin them (On Translation, 2006).\n\nRicoeur\u2019s investigation of practices of interpretation did not\npropose a single general theory applicable in each and every case. His\napproach was rather to formulate his theory of discourse as a use of\nlanguage meant to say something to someone about something using\nexamples of such discourse and their interpretation. But language as\nspoken is ephemeral, it disappears. Ricoeur\u2019s genial insight was\nto turn to examples that fixed such discourse by inscribing it in\ntexts or what might be treated as analogous to a text. The event of\nspeaking might disappear but the text remains for anyone who knows how\nto read. Hence it is the meaning of the text rather than the original\nauthor\u2019s intention or the originating situation that becomes the\nobject of interpretation. Structuralism was correct that texts have a\nstructure. But this structure varies depending on the kind of\ndiscourse inscribed in the text, so discerning that structure and how\nit contributes to shaping that discourse helps one identify the\ndiscourse as being of a certain type or genre. Initially recognizing\nthis genre is something like a guess that has to be confirmed through\ninterpreting the text, but a good reading also opens interpreters to\nbeing questioned about their initial assumptions by the text in\nquestion. What one discovers through such investigations, Ricoeur\nbelieved, is that there is something like a world of the text that\nlies not behind the text but metaphorically in front of it as\nsomething to be explored by the interpreter\u2019s imagination. This\nis a world that we can think of ourselves as inhabiting.\nInterpretations, of course, need to be checked against and challenged\nby other interpretations and they will sooner or later need to be\nredone as situations change over time. So there is a possibility of\nboth internal and external critique: is a text coherent in terms of\nits generic form, can it be confirmed or falsified by other similar\ndocuments or subsequent data? Explanatory techniques also play a role,\nparticularly when understanding breaks down. In a nice turn of phrase,\nRicoeur liked to say one then seeks to explain more in order to\nunderstand better. He also agreed with Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s\ntheory of hermeneutics that what is finally at stake in interpretation\nis a kind of appropriation, although Ricoeur saw this as more oriented\nto action in the present than to what Gadamer called the appropriation\nof tradition, although tradition always did have a role to play, even\nwhen criticized or rejected. He agreed with Gadamer, moreover, that\nthe goal of interpretation was to enable us to make sense of our\nembodied existence with others including our predecessors and\nsuccessors in the world.\n\nRicoeur did not produce a general theory of interpretation. His\nreflections on hermeneutics were themselves an instance of the\nphilosophical practice of interpretation leading to insight into what\nultimately underlies and enables such activity: the need to interpret\nin order to make sense of human life; the move from an initial\nunderstanding to greater understanding on the basis of critical\nreflection and an appeal to the imagination; interpolating explanatory\ntechniques and procedures where understanding breaks down;\nappropriation of the meaning of discourse in terms of the world it\nprojects, as a world one might inhabit. And finally: increased\nself-understanding.\n",
