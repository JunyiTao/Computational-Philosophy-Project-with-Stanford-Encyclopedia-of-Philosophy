Impossibility Results\n\nThe impossibility results for coherence draw on all three\ndebates summarized above: the Lewis-BonJour controversy, the debate\nover probabilistic measures of coherence and also the dispute in\nAnalysis regarding truth conduciveness. Before we can discuss\nthe results we need to make one further observation. Given the\nconclusion of the Lewis-BonJour dispute, it is a reasonable\nexpectation that no coherence measure is truth conducive, in the\nrelevant conditional sense, unless the reports (beliefs, memories\netc.) in question are individually credible and collectively\nindependent. But assuming this is not sufficient for coherence to\nstand a reasonable chance of being truth conducive. We must also\nrequire that when we compare two different sets of reports, we do so\nwhile keeping the degree of individual credibility fixed. Otherwise we\ncould have a situation in which one set of report contents is more\ncoherent than another set but still fails to give rise to a higher\nlikelihood of truth simply because the reporters delivering the\npropositions in the less coherent set are individually more reliable.\nThus, truth conduciveness must be understood in a ceteris\nparibus sense. The question of interest, then, is whether more\ncoherence implies a higher probability (given independence and\nindividual credibility) everything else being equal. We are\nnow finally in a position to state the impossibility theorems. What\nthey show is that no measure of coherence is truth conducive even in a\nweak ceteris paribus sense, under the favorable conditions of\n(conditional) independence and individual credibility.\n\nThe first result of this nature was presented by Bovens and Hartmann\n(2003). Their definition of truth conduciveness deviates slightly from\nthe standard account given above. As they define it, a measure\n\\(C\\) is truth conducive if and only if, for all sets \\(S\\) and\n\\(S'\\), if \\(S\\) is at least as coherent as\n\\(S'\\) according to \\(C\\), then \\(S\\) is at least as\nlikely to be true as \\(S'\\) ceteris paribus and\ngiven independence and individual credibility. Very roughly, their\nproof has the following structure: They show that there are sets\n\\(S\\) and \\(S'\\), each containing three\npropositions, such that which set is more likely to be true will\ndepend on the level at which the individual credibility (reliability)\nis held fixed. Thus for lower degrees of reliability, one set, say\n\\(S\\), will be more probable than the other set, \\(S'\\);\nfor higher degrees of reliability, the situation will be reversed. One\ncan now find a counterexample to the truth conduciveness of any\nmeasure \\(C\\) through a strategic choice of the level at which the\nreliability is held fixed. Suppose for instance that, according to\n\\(C\\), the set \\(S\\) is more coherent than the set\n\\(S'\\). In order to construct a counterexample to \\(C\\)\u2019s\ntruth conduciveness, we set the reliability to a value for which\n\\(S'\\) will be more probable than \\(S\\). If, on the other\nhand, \\(C\\) makes \\(S'\\) more coherent than \\(S\\), we\nfix the reliability to a level at which \\(S\\) will be the more\nprobable set. For the details, see Bovens and Hartmann (2003, section\n1.4).\n\nOlsson defines truth conduciveness in the standard fashion. His\nimpossibility theorem is based on the following alternative proof\nstrategy (Olsson 2005, appendix B): Consider a situation of two\nwitnesses both reporting that \\(A\\), represented by\n\\(S = \\langle A, A\\rangle\\). Take a measure\n\\(C\\) of coherence that is informative with respect to \\(S\\), in\nthe sense that it does not assign the same degree of coherence to\n\\(S\\) regardless of which probability assignment is used. This\nmeans that the measure is non-trivial in the situation in question.\nTake two assignments \\(P\\) and \\(P'\\) of probabilities to\nthe propositions in \\(S\\) that give rise to different coherence\nvalues. Olsson shows that a counter example to the truth conduciveness\nof \\(C\\) can be constructed through a strategic choice of the\nprobability of reliability. If \\(P\\) makes \\(S\\) more coherent\nthan does \\(P'\\) according to \\(C\\), we fix the\nprobability of reliability in such a way that \\(S\\) comes out as\nmore probable on \\(P'\\) than on \\(P\\). If, on the other\nhand, \\(P'\\) makes \\(S\\) more coherent, then we choose a\nvalue for the probability of reliability so that \\(P\\) makes\n\\(S\\) more probable. It follows that no coherence measure is both\ntruth conducive and informative.\n\nThere are some further subtle differences between the two results.\nFirst, Olsson\u2019s theorem is proved against the backdrop of a\ndynamic (or, in the language of Bovens and Hartmann, 2003,\nendogenous) model of reliability: the assessment of witness\nreliability, which in this model is represented as a probability of\nreliability, may change as we obtain more reports. Bovens and\nHartmann\u2019s detailed proof assumes a non-dynamic (exogenous) model of\nreliability, although they indicate that the result carries over to\nthe dynamic (endogenous) case. Second, there is a difference in the\nway the ceteris paribus condition is understood. Olsson fixes\nthe initial probability of reliability, but allows the prior\nprobability of the report contents to vary. Bovens and Hartmann fix\nnot only the reliability but also the prior probability of the report\ncontents.\n\nThese impossibility results give rise to a thought-provoking paradox.\nIt can hardly be doubted that we trust and rely on coherence reasoning\nwhen judging the believability of information, in everyday life and in\nscience (see Harris and Hahn, 2009, for an experimental study in a\nBayesian setting). But how can this be when in fact coherence is not\ntruth conducive? Since the impossibility results were published a\nnumber of studies have been dedicated to the resolution of this\nparadox (see Meijs and Douven, 2007, for an overview of some possible\nmoves). These studies can be divided into two camps. Researchers in\nthe first camp accept the conclusion that the impossibility results\nshow that coherence is not truth conducive. They add, however, that\nthis does not prevent coherence from being valuable and important in\nother ways. Researchers in the other camp do not accept the conclusion\nthat the impossibility results show that coherence is not truth\nconducive because they think that at least one premise used in proving\nthe results is doubtful.\n\nLet us start with responses from the first camp. Dietrich and Moretti\n(2005) show that coherence in the sense of the Olsson measure is\nlinked to the practice of indirect confirmation of scientific\nhypotheses. That measure turns out to be, in the terminology of\nMoretti (2007), \u201cconfirmation conducive\u201d. Glass (2007)\nargues, similarly, that coherence can provide the key to a precise\naccount of inference to the best explanation, the main idea being to\nuse a coherence measure for ranking competing hypotheses in terms of\ntheir coherence with a given piece of evidence. Furthermore, Olsson\nand Schubert (2007) observe that, while coherence falls short of being\ntruth conducive, it can still be \u201creliability conducive\u201d,\ni.e., more coherence, according to some measures, entails a higher\nprobability that the sources are reliable, at least in a paradigmatic\ncase (cf. Schubert 2012a, 2011). Nevertheless, Schubert has proved an impossibility theorem to the effect that no coherence\nmeasure is reliability conducive in general (Schubert 2012b). For yet\nanother example, Angere (2007, 2008) argues, based on computer\nsimulations, that the fact that coherence fails to be truth conducive,\nin the above sense, does not prevent it from being connected with\ntruth in a weaker, defeasible sense. In fact, almost all coherence\nmeasures that have an independent standing in the literature satisfy\nthe condition that most cases of higher coherence are also\ncases of higher probability, although they do so to different degrees. Moreover, Roche (2013b) has demonstrated that assuming a set to\nbe coherent implies an increase in the probability of truth of any of\nits elements. This is a weak form of truth-conduciveness, and Roche is\nright to point out that it should not give the coherentist much\ncomfort. It has also been noted that coherence plays an important\nnegative role in our thinking. If our beliefs show signs of\nincoherence, this is often a good reason for contemplating a revision.\nSee chapter 10 in Olsson (2005) for an elaboration of this point.\n\nAs for the other approach to the impossibility results (questioning\nthe premises used in their derivation), we have already seen that\nHuemer (2007, 2011), in connection with the Lewis-BonJour dispute, has\nexpressed doubts regarding the standard way of formalizing\nindependence in terms of conditional probability. It should come as no\nsurprise that he objects to the impossibility results (ibid.) on the\nsame grounds. In his 2011 article, Huemer even questions the Content\nDetermination Thesis, which plays a pivotal role in the derivation of\nthe results, for reasons that we have to leave aside here.\n\nAll these things can be consistently questioned. But the question is:\nat what cost? We have already seen that there are strong systematic\nreasons for explicating independence in terms of conditional\nindependence in the standard way. Furthermore, the Content\nDetermination Thesis is deeply entrenched in just about all work on\ncoherence that takes agreeing witnesses to be the prototypical case.\nGiving up Content Determination would mean purging the coherence\ntheory of one of its clearest and most distinctive pre-systematic\nintuitions: that coherence is a property at the level of report\ncontents. The worry is that coherentism is saved at the cost\nof robbing it of almost all its significance, as Ewing put it almost a\ncentury ago in response to a similar worry (Ewing 1934, 246).\n\nThese concerns do not obviously carry over to another dialectical\nmove: questioning the ceteris paribus conditions employed in\nthe impossibility results, i.e., the conditions that determine what to\nhold fixed as the degree of coherence is varied. This line of\ncriticism has been taken up by several authors, including Douven and\nMeijs (2007), Schupbach (2008) and Huemer (2011), and it may well be\nthe internally least problematic strategy to explore for those who are\ninclined to challenge the premises upon which the impossibility\nresults are based. It should be borne in mind, though, that the\ntendency to offer ever stronger ceteris paribus conditions\nmay in the end be self-defeating. As more things are held fixed, it\nbecomes easier for a coherence measure to be truth conducive. Hence,\nresearchers pursuing this line of defense ultimately run the risk of\ntrivializing the debate by making coherence truth conducive by\ndefinition (cf. Schubert 2012b).\n\nThere are some attempts to explain or come to grips with the\nimpossibility results that do not easily fit into the two camps\nidentified above or represent a combination of ideas from both. For an\nexample of the latter, Wheeler (2012; see also Wheeler and Scheines,\n2013) both suggest focusing on reliability conduciveness as opposed to\ntruth conduciveness (camp 1) and question the assumptions, primarily\nindependence but also the Content Determination Thesis, used in the\nderivation of the impossibility results (camp 2). Shogenji (2007,\n2013) and McGraw (2016) are other complex and insightful attempts to\ndeepen the Bayesian analysis and diagnose of those results. Specifically, Lydia McGrew argues for a shift in focus from the coherence of contents of reports to coherence of the evidence with an hypothesis \\(H\\) (which need not coincide with the conjunction of the report contents). If the conjunction of the members of a set of evidence supports some hypothesis \\(H\\), and if all members of that set are playing a role in that epistemic effect, then that set of evidence is, McGrew shows, indeed confirmatory of \\(H\\) and in that sense truth-conducive for \\(H\\) (McGrew, 2016). McGrew offers several proposals for how to spell out \u201ccoherence with \\(H\\)\u201d.\n",
