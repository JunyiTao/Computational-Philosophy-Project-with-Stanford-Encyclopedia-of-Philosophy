    "main_text": "\n\n Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939) was one of the\nprincipal founders and movers of the school of logic that flourished in\nWarsaw between the two world wars. He was the originator of an\nunorthodox system of the foundations of mathematics, based on three\nformal systems: Protothetic, a logic of propositions and their\nfunctions; Ontology: a logic of names, and functors of arbitrary order;\nand Mereology, a general theory of part and whole. His concern for\nutmost rigor in the formalization and execution of logic, coupled with\na nominalistic rejection of abstract entities, led to a precise but\nhighly unusual metalogic. His strictures on correctly\ndistinguishing use from mention of expressions, his canons of correct\ndefinition, and his mereology, have all informed the logical\nmainstream, but the majority of his logical views and innovations have\nnot been widely adopted. Despite this, his influence as a teacher and\nas a motor for logical innovation are widely acknowledged. He remains\none of logic\u2019s most original figures.\n",
