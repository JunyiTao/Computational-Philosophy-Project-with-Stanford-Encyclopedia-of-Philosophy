    "main_text": "Importance and Applicability of the Distinction || Philosophy\n2.2 Philosophy\n\n\nObviously then, types play an important role in philosophy of\nlanguage, linguistics and, with its emphasis on expressions, logic.\nEspecially noteworthy is the debate concerning the relation between the\nmeaning of a sentence type and the speaker's meaning in using a\ntoken (a relation that figures prominently in Grice 1969). But the\ntype-token distinction also functions significantly in other branches\nof philosophy as well. In philosophy of mind, it yields two\nversions of the identity theory of mind (each of which is criticized in\nKripke 1972). The type version of the identity theory (defended by\nSmart (1959) and Place (1956) among others) identifies types\nof mental events/states/processes with types of physical\nevents/states/processes. It says that just as lightning turned out to\nbe electrical discharge, so pain might turn out to be c-fiber\nstimulation, and consciousness might turn out to be brain waves of 40\ncycles per second. On this type view, thinking and feeling are certain\ntypes of neurological processes, so absent those processes, there can\nbe no thinking. The token identity theory (defended by Kim (1966) and\nDavidson (1980) among others) maintains that every token mental event\nis some token physical event or other, but it denies that a type\nmatch-up must be expected. So for example, even if pain in humans turns\nout to be c-fiber stimulation, there may be other life forms that lack\nc-fibers but have pains too. And even if consciousness in humans turns\nout to be a brain waves that occur 40 times per second, perhaps\nandroids have consciousness even if they lack such brain waves.\n\n\nIn aesthetics, it is generally necessary to distinguish\nworks of art themselves (types) from their physical incarnations\n(tokens). (See, for example, Wollheim 1968, Wolterstorff 1980 and\nDavies 2001.) This is not the case with respect to oil paintings like\nthe Mona Lisa where there is and perhaps can be only one\ntoken, but seems to be the case for many other works of art. There can\nbe more than one token of a sculpture made from a mold, more than one\nelegant building made from a blueprint, more than one copy of a film,\nand more than one performance of a musical work. Beethoven wrote nine\nsymphonies, but although he conducted the first performance of\nSymphony No. 9, he never heard the Ninth, whereas the rest of\nus have all heard it, that is, we have all heard tokens of it.\n\n\nIn ethics, actions are said to be right/wrong\u2014but is it\naction types or only action tokens? There is a dispute about this. Most\nethicists from Mill (1979) to Ross (1988) hold that the hallmark of\nethical conduct is universalizability, so that a particular action is\nright/wrong only if it is right/wrong for anyone else in similar\ncircumstances\u2014in other words, only if it is the right/wrong\ntype of action. If certain types of actions are right and\nothers wrong, then there may be general indefeasible ethical principles\n(however complicated they may be to state, and whether they can be\nstated at all). But some ethicists hold that there are no general\nethical principles that hold come what may\u2014that there is always some\ncircumstance in which such principles would prescribe the wrong\noutcome\u2014and such ethicists may go on to add that only particular\n(token) actions are right/wrong, not types of actions. See, for\nexample, Murdoch 1970 and Dancy 2004.\n",
