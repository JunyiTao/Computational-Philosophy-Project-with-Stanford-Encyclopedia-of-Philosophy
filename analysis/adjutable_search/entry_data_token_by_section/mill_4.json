    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || Foundations of Theoretical Reason\n3.2 Foundations of Theoretical Reason\n\nWe cannot acquire any genuine knowledge a priori, then. Mill\nholds that knowledge can be obtained only by empirical observation,\nand by reasoning which takes place on the ground of such observations.\nThis principle stands at the heart of his radical empiricism. Sense\nperceptions are the \u201coriginal data, or ultimate premises of our\nknowledge\u201d (System, VII: 7)\u2014knowledge of greater\nlevels of complexity is arrived at solely by inferences from that\noriginal data. And, as we shall see, Mill grants the validity of only\none kind of inference. \u201cInference, consequently all Proof, and\nall discovery of truths not self-evident, consists of inductions, and\nthe interpretation of inductions\u201d (System, VII:\n283).\n\n\nInduction properly so called [\u2026] may [\u2026] be summarily\ndefined as Generalization from Experience. It consists in inferring\nfrom some individual instances in which a phenomenon is observed to\noccur, that it occurs in all instances of a certain class; namely, in\nall which resemble the former, in what are regarded as the\nmaterial circumstances. (System, VII: 306)\n\n\nMill rightly notes that upon observing that x1,\nx2, x3, \u2026\nxn are P, human beings are disposed to form the\nbelief that some relevantly similar xn+1 is P.\nUpon seeing ten swans, all white, for instance, we tend to believe\nthat an eleventh unseen swan is also white. But, Mill holds, such\ninferences are not something we are merely disposed to\nbelieve, but something we have reason to\nbelieve\u2014inferences of this general form are warranted.\nThe question arises, of course, how it is that we can be warranted in\nbelieving the results of induction prior to their confirmation or\ndisconfirmation\u2014how it comes to be that we can be\njustified in believing an inductively suggested\nconclusion.\n\nMill offers two answers to this question. The first, we might term his\niterative validation of induction. We are warranted in\nbelieving enumerative inductions, Mill thinks, because \u201c[t]he\nuniverse, so far as known to us, is so constituted, that whatever is\ntrue in any one case, is true in all cases of a certain\ndescription\u201d (System, VII: 306). This uniformity of\nnature, however, is something we do not, and could not, know a\npriori, but only itself as \u201cas an instance of\ninduction\u201d (System, VII: 307). We know, in other words,\nby an act of induction, that inductive generalizations tend\nto be true, and that induction is therefore a good way of reasoning.\nInduction is, in this sense, self-supporting.\n\nOf course, this justification is circular, as Mill realizes. If we are\nwarranted in believing that induction is in general a good way of\nreasoning only to the extent that our past inductions are themselves\ntaken to have been good inferences, then the question remains how\nthose inductions can be warranted forms of inference (cf. \nFumerton 2009: 167\u20138). Mill\u2019s second answer,\nwhich we might term his initiating validation of induction,\naddresses this issue. \n\n\nMany of the uniformities existing among phenomena are so constant, and\nso open to observation, as to force themselves upon involuntary\nrecognition. (System, VII: 318) \n\n\nWe are, Mill claims, naturally inclined to reason inductively, and\nupon critical inspection, acts of induction strike us as\n\u201cdeserving of reliance\u201d (System, VII: 319). We\nadopt induction \u201cspontaneously\u201d as a method of\nreasoning\u2014and under free consideration, it seems to us\nreasonable to do so (System, VII: 317).\n\nThis initiating validation of the principle of induction is directly\nparallel to Mill\u2019s argument for the principle of utility\n(Macleod 2014). We are naturally inclined to desire pleasure, and such\ndesires, when we attend to them, strike us as reasonable\u2014as\nbeing desire-worthy. Similarly, we are naturally disposed to\nbelieve in inductive generalisations, and such beliefs, when we attend\nto them, strike us as reasonable\u2014being belief-worthy.\nIn each case, there is no further initial justification of our natural\nreasoning propensities beyond the fact that, upon critical inspection,\nthey strike us as sound. Indeed, that valid principles of\nreason\u2014practical and theoretical\u2014are established by\ncasting a critical eye upon how we in fact do reason should\nbe of no surprise: such an anthropological approach to the normative\nis forced by Mill\u2019s naturalism. We cannot know what constitutes\ngood reasoning a priori, and as such \u201c[t]he laws of our\nrational faculty, like those of every other natural agency, are only\nlearnt by seeing the agent at work\u201d (System, VII:\n833).\n\nThe evidence provided by critically examining our natural modes of\nreasoning is of course defeasible\u2014as in the case of the\n\u2018proof\u2019 of the principle of utility, the initiating\nvalidation is not a proof in the traditional deductive sense. But the\njustification provided is real nevertheless. And from here, iterative\nvalidation can increase our confidence that we are warranted in\nreasoning inductively: further inductions ranging over inductions can\nimprove our reasoning abilities by establishing in more and more\nprecise ways the circumstances in which inductive moves are good ones\nto make. Indeed, this process of sharpening inductive reasoning by\n\u201culterior revision of [\u2026] spontaneous\ngeneralizations\u201d (System, VII: 319) is, as we shall\nsee, the very heart of the process of scientific thinking.\n\nAs noted above, Mill claims not only that enumerative induction is\na valid principle, but that it is the sole principle\nby which we are justified in inferring unobserved facts about the\nworld.\n [2]\n In particular, he rejects the independent validity of the\n\u201cHypothetical Method\u201d\u2014what has come to be known as\ninference to the best explanation (System, VII: 492). We are\nnot entitled, that is to say, to believe in something\nunobserved solely on the basis that it explains the\nobserved facts (Skorupski 1989: 197\u2013202; see also\nMacleod 2016; Jacobs 1991). A hypothesis \n\n\nis not to be received probably true because it accounts for all the\nknown phenomena; since this is a condition sometimes fulfilled\ntolerably well by two conflicting hypotheses. (System, VII:\n500) \n\n\nThis is not to deny the role of hypothesis in investigation\naltogether, however. Mill claims that hypotheses about unobserved\nentities made in an effort to explain empirical observations can\nprovide useful suggestions, but that entitlement to believe\ncan only be provided by reasoning based on the principle of\nenumerative induction. \n\n\n[H]ypothesis, by suggesting observations and experiments, puts us on\nthe road to that independent evidence if it be really\nattainable. (System, VII: 496, my emphasis)\n\n",
