    "main_text": "Principles to Guide Behavior in International and Global Matters || The Influence of Rawls\u2019s Law of Peoples\n2.1 The Influence of Rawls\u2019s Law of Peoples\n\nIn The Law of Peoples, John Rawls argues for eight principles\nthat he believes should regulate international interactions of\npeoples. For Rawls, a \u201cpeople\u201d is constituted by a group\nof persons who have in common sufficient characteristics such as\nculture, history, tradition, or sentiment. Rawls uses the term\n\u201cpeople\u201d in ways that relevantly correspond with how many\nuse the term \u201cnation\u201d. In addition, Rawls often assumes\nthat, for the most part, each people has a state.\n\nThe eight principles Rawls endorses acknowledge peoples\u2019\nindependence and equality, that peoples have the right to\nself-determination along with having duties of non-intervention, that\nthey ought to observe treaties, honor a particular list of human\nrights, should conduct themselves in certain appropriate ways if they\nengage in warfare, and that they have duties to assist other peoples\nin establishing institutions to enable people\u2019s\nself-determination. He also advocates for international institutions\ngoverning trade, borrowing, and other international matters that are\ncharacteristically dealt with by the United Nations.\n\nSeveral claims have been the subject of much debate between critics\nand defenders of Rawls\u2019s position. In particular, Rawls believes\nthat so long as all peoples have a set of institutions that enable\ncitizens to lead decent lives, any global inequality that might remain\nis not morally troubling. Critics draw attention to the ways in which\nglobal inequality \u2013 perhaps in levels of power or affluence\n\u2013 can convert into opportunities for deprivation and\ndisadvantage. For instance, the global advantaged can use their\nsuperior position to influence the rules that govern international\ninstitutions \u2013 such as trade practices \u2013 which can\nfacilitate further opportunities for increased advantage and so they\ncan indeed threaten the abilities of others in distant lands to lead\ndecent lives (Pogge\n 2008).[1]\n\nAnother important issue that underlies debate between Rawls and his\ncritics concerns different views about the nature and origins of\nprosperity. Rawls gives a particularly strong statement of what he\ntakes the causes of prosperity to be. He claims that the causes of the\nwealth of a people can be traced to the domestic political culture,\nthe virtues and vices of leaders, and the quality of domestic\ninstitutions. He says:\n\nI believe that the causes of the wealth of a people and the forms it\ntakes lie in their political culture and in the religious,\nphilosophical, and moral traditions that support the basic structure\nof their political and social institutions, as well as in the\nindustriousness and cooperative talents of its members \u2026 The\ncrucial elements that make the difference are the political culture,\nthe political virtues and civic society of the country (Rawls 1999,\n108).\n\n\nCritics observe that in addition to local factors, there are also\ninternational ones which play an important role in prospects for\nwell-being. Thomas Pogge prominently helps bring some of these into\nview. The international borrowing and resource privileges, are good\nexamples of the ways in which international practices can have\nprofound effects on domestic factors which undeniably also play a role\nin promoting prosperity. According to the international borrowing\nprivilege, governments may borrow amounts of money on behalf of the\ncountry and the country thereby incurs an obligation to repay the\ndebt. The international resource privilege refers to a\ngovernment\u2019s ability to do what it likes with resources,\nincluding selling them to whomever it chooses to and at what price.\nAny group that exercises effective power in a state is internationally\nrecognized as the legitimate government of that territory and enjoys\nthe two privileges. But, Pogge argues, this sets up undesirable\nincentives that hamper developing countries\u2019 abilities to\nflourish (Pogge 2008). These include incentivizing those strongly\nmotivated to hold office for material gain to take power by force or\nexercise it in ways that help reinforce oppressive governments\u2019\nabilities to retain control. The global advantaged benefit greatly\nfrom these privileges and so have little incentive to reform them.\nBut, according to Pogge, reforms are sorely needed. If only\nsufficiently legitimate governments are able to enjoy these\nprivileges, the international community would remove one important\nobstacle developing countries currently face.\n\nDefenders of Rawls\u2019s views argue that his position is more\ncomplex than is commonly acknowledged and allows for both a principled\nstance on some fundamental values along with appropriate openness to\nalternative ways in which legitimate and decent peoples might organize\ntheir collective lives (Reidy 2004; Freeman 2006). They argue that\nRawls\u2019s position shows great sensitivity to a number of factors\nthat must be weighed in considering right conduct in international\naffairs. For instance, when Rawls makes his bold claims about the\ncauses of wealth it is useful to bear in mind the context in which he\nis arguing. Against an assumption that resources are enormously\nimportant for a society\u2019s ability to flourish, Rawls emphasizes\nthe importance of strong institutions, political culture and other\nlocal factors, in sustaining decent lives for citizens. Rawls also\nreflects on the difficulty of changing political culture, noting that\nsimply transferring resources will not help. Interestingly, in a\nlittle discussed passage, Rawls ventures that an \u201cemphasis on\nhuman rights may work to change ineffective regimes and the conduct of\nrulers who have been callous about the well-being of their own\npeople\u201d (Rawls 1999, 109). For more on whether Rawls provides us\nwith a cogent model that can provide sage guidance in international\nmatters see the entries on on\n international distributive justice\n and\n John Rawls.\n See also Martin and Reidy (2006). For the purposes of this entry we\nneed only summarize some key questions that were influential in\nsetting the terms of discussion about global justice for some\ntime.\n\nSome key questions are:\n\nWhat principles should govern interactions among peoples at the\nglobal level?\nWhat are the causes of prosperity and are they traceable entirely\nto domestic factors or are international considerations relevant?\nWhat should count as the kind of prosperity or well-being that we\nare aiming to promote?\nDo we have an obligation to ensure people have their basic needs\nmet and can otherwise lead \u201cdecent\u201d lives, or should we be\nmore concerned with global socio-economic equality?\nWhat duties do we have to those peoples who do not yet have what\nthey need for self-determination or prosperity?\nIf human rights serve an important role in world affairs, which\nrights should be on our list of those to endorse? What duties arise\nfrom such commitment?\nCan we properly hold nations to be entirely responsible for the\nwell-being of their people and if so, in what kinds of conditions\nmight this make sense? How do we encourage nations to take\nresponsibility for their people\u2019s well-being?\nWhen we consider what we owe one another, do compatriots deserve\nspecial consideration?\n\n\nWe trace some of the influential positions that have shaped answers to\nthese questions next.\n",
