    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || The Generalization Problem\n4.5 The Generalization Problem\n\nSince deflationists place such heavy emphasis on the role of the\nconcept of truth in expressing generalizations, it seems somewhat\nironic that certain versions of deflationism have been criticized for\nbeing incapable of accounting for generalizations involving\ntruth (Gupta 1993a, 1993b; Field 1994a, 2008; Horwich 1998a\n(137\u20138), 2001; Halbach 1999 and 2011 (57\u20139); Soames 1999,\nArmour-Garb 2004, 2010, 2011). The \u201cGeneralization\nProblem\u201d (henceforth, \\(GP)\\) captures the worry that a\ndeflationary account of truth is inadequate for explaining our\ncommitments to general facts we express with certain uses of\n\u2018true\u2019. This raises the question of whether and, if so,\nhow, deflationary accounts earn the right to endorse such\ngeneralizations.\n\nAlthough Tarski (1935 [1956]) places great importance on the instances\nof his (T)-schema, he comes to recognize that those instances do not\nprovide a fully adequate way of characterizing truth. Moreover, even\nwhen the instances of (T) are taken as theorems, Tarski (ibid.) points\nout that taken all together they are insufficient for proving a\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalization like\n\n(A)\nAll sentences of the form \u2018If \\(p\\), then \\(p\\)\u2019 are\ntrue.\n\n\nsince the collection of the instances of (T) is \\(\\omega\\)-incomplete\n(where a theory, \\(\\theta\\), is \\(\\omega\\)-incomplete if\n\\(\\theta\\) can prove every instance of an open formula\n\u2018\\(Fx\\)\u2019 but cannot prove the universal generalization,\n\u2018\\(\\forall xFx\\)\u2019).\n\nWe arrive at a related problem when we combine a reliance on the\ninstances of some version of (ES) with Quine\u2019s view about the\nfunctioning and utility of the truth predicate. He (1992, 81)\nconsiders the purpose of (A) to be to express a generalization over\nsentences like the following:\n\n(B)\nIf it is raining, then it is raining.\n(C)\nIf snow is white, then snow is white.\n\n\nQuine points out that we want to be able to generalize on the embedded\nsentences in those conditionals, by semantically ascending,\nabstracting logical form, and deriving (A). But, as Tarski (ibid.)\nnotes, this feat cannot be achieved, given only a commitment to (the\ninstances of) (T). From (T) and (A), we can prove (B) and (C) but,\ngiven the finitude of deduction, when equipped only with the instances\nof (T), we cannot prove (A). As a consequence of the Compactness\nTheorem of first-order logic, anything provable from the totality of\nthe instances of (T) is provable from just finitely many of them, so\nany theory that takes the totality of the instances of (T) to\ncharacterize truth will be unable to prove any generalization like\n(A).\n\nTo address the question of why we need to be able to prove these\ntruth-involving generalizations, suppose that we accept a proposition\nlike \\(\\langle\\)Every proposition of the form \\(\\langle\\)if \\(p\\),\nthen \\(p\\rangle\\) is true\\(\\rangle\\). Call this proposition\n\u201c\\(\\beta\\)\u201d. Now take \u2018\\(\\Gamma\\)\u2019 to stand\nfor the collection of propositions that are the instances of\n\\(\\beta\\). Horwich (2001) maintains that an account of the meaning of\n\u2018true\u2019 will be adequate only if it aids in explaining why\nwe accept the members of \\(\\Gamma\\), where such explanations amount to\nproofs of those propositions by, among other things, employing an\nexplanatory premise that does not explicitly concern the truth\npredicate. So, one reason it is important to be able to prove a\n\u2018true\u2019-involving generalization is because this is a\ncondition of adequacy for an account of the meaning of that term. One\nmight argue that anyone who grasps the concept of truth, and that of\nthe relevant conditional, should be said to know \\(\\beta\\). But if a\ngiven account of truth, together with an account of the conditional\n(along, perhaps, with an account of other logical notions), does not\nentail \\(\\beta\\), then it does not provide an acceptable account of\ntruth.\n\nHere is another reason for thinking that generalizations like\n\\(\\beta\\) must be proved. A theory of the meaning of\n\u2018true\u2019 should explain our acceptance of propositions like\n\\(\\beta\\), which, as Gupta (1993a) and Hill (2002) emphasize, should\nbe knowable a priori by anyone who possesses the concept of\ntruth (and who grasps the relevant logical concepts). But if such a\nproposition can be known a priori on the basis of a grasp of\nthe concept of truth (and of the relevant logical concepts), then a\ntheory that purports to specify the meaning of \u2018true\u2019\nshould be able to explain our acceptance of that proposition. But if\nan account of the meaning of \u2018true\u2019 is going to do this,\nit must be possible to derive the proposition from one or more of the\nclauses that constitute our grasp of the concept of truth.\n\nThis creates a problem for a Horwichian minimalist. Let us suppose\nthat \\(\\beta\\) is one of the general propositions that must be\nprovable. Restricted to the resources available through\nHorwich\u2019s minimalism, we can show that \\(\\beta\\) cannot be\nderived.\n\nIf a Horwichian minimalist could derive \\(\\beta\\), it would have to be\nderived from the instances of\n\n(E)\n\\(\\langle p\\rangle\\) is true iff \\(p.\\)\n\n\nBut there cannot be a valid derivation of a universal generalization\nfrom a set of particular propositions unless that set is inconsistent.\nSince, according to Horwich (1998a), every instance of (E) that is\npart of his theory of truth is consistent, it follows that there\ncannot be a derivation of \\(\\beta\\) from the instances of (E). This is\na purely logical point. As such, considerations of pure logic dictate\nthat our acceptance of \\(\\beta\\) cannot be explained by\nHorwich\u2019s account of truth. Since Horwich takes all instances of\nthe propositional version of (T) (i.e., (ES-prop)) as axioms, he can\nprove each of those instances. But, as we have seen, restricted to the\ninstances of the equivalence schema, he cannot prove the\ngeneralization, \\(\\beta\\), i.e., \\(\\langle\\)Every proposition of the\nform \\(\\langle\\)if \\(p\\) then \\(p\\rangle\\) is true\\(\\rangle\\).\n\nSome deflationists respond to the GP by using a version of (GT) to\nformulate their approach:\n\n(GT)\n\\(\\forall x\\) \\((x\\) is true iff \\(\\Sigma p(x = \\langle p\\rangle\n\\amp p)).\\)\n\n\nIn this context, there are two things to notice about (GT). First, it\nis not a schema but a universally quantified formula. For this reason,\nit is possible to derive a generalization like \\(\\beta\\) from it.\nSecond, the existential quantifier, \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019, in (GT)\nmust be a higher-order quantifier (see the entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic)\n that quantifies into sentential positions. We mentioned above an\napproach that takes this quantifier as a substitutional one, where the\nsubstitution class consists of sentences. We also mentioned\nHill\u2019s (2002) alternative version that takes the substitution\nclass to be the set of all propositions. K\u00fcnne (2003) suggests a\ndifferent approach that takes \u2018\\(\\Sigma\\)\u2019 to be an\nobjectual (domain and values) quantifier ranging over propositions.\nHowever, parallel to Horwich\u2019s rejection of (GT) discussed in\nSection 3.1, all of these approaches have drawn criticism on the\ngrounds that the use of higher-order quantifiers to define truth is\ncircular (cf. Platts 1980, McGrath 2000), and may get the extension of\nthe concept of truth wrong (cf. Sosa 1993).\n\nAn alternative deflationist approach to the GP attempts to show that,\ndespite appearances, certain deflationary theories do have the\nresources to derive the relevant generalizations. Field (1994a,\n2001a), for example, suggests that we allow reasoning with schemas\ndirectly and proposes rules that would allow the derivation of\ngeneralizations. Horwich (1998a, 2001) suggests a more informal\napproach according to which we are justified in deriving \\(\\beta\\)\nsince an informal inspection of a derivation of some instance of\n\\(\\beta\\) shows us that we could derive any instance of it.
