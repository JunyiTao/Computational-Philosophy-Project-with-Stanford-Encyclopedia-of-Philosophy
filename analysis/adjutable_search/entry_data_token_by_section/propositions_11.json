We discuss two such proposals here.\n\nFirst, the relationalist might claim that-clauses are\nambiguous, and in particular that they pick out different kinds of\nentities depending on which attitude verb they complement. How do we\ntell what kinds of entities are picked out? We look at substitution\nfailures. Thus, it might be argued the truth of \u2018\\(S\\) remembers\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019 requires that the subject bear the remembering\nrelation to a fact, rather than a proposition. After all,\n\u2018remember\u2019 shows substitution failures for \u2018the\n(true) proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 but not for \u2018the fact that\n\\(p\\)\u2019.\n\nHowever, there are obstacles to this response. For one thing, some\nattitude verbs seem not to permit substitutions no matter which\nnominal complement is chosen. King (2002) gives the example of\n\u2018feel\u2019. What sorts of entities, then, do\nthat-clauses designate when they complement\n\u2018feel\u2019? No answer is possible. Is the Relational Analysis\ntherefore false of such verbs? Perhaps even more damaging, there are\nverbs which are near synonyms of \u2018believes\u2019, at least in\nattitude ascriptions, and which grammatically take NP complements, but\nwhich exhibit substitution failures and objectivization.\n\u2018Feel\u2019 is one example, as are \u2018maintain\u2019,\n\u2018hold\u2019, \u2018judge\u2019, \u2018expect\u2019, and\n\u2018suspect\u2019. How could \u2018believes\u2019 designate a\nrelation to propositions in attitude ascriptions but these verbs not?\nConsider also the near-synonyms \u2018assert\u2019 and\n\u2018claim\u2019.\n\nEven if the ambiguity hypothesis cannot provide the propositionalist\nwith a general solution to the Substitution Problem and the\nObjectivization Effect, it may help in explaining other\nlinguistic phenomena, such as the distributional differences between\nvarious nominal complements (\u2018the fact that \\(p\\)\u2019,\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, \u2018the possibility that\n\\(p\\)\u2019, etc.). (See Vendler 1967 and Moffett 2003.)\n\nNebel (2019) proposes an alternate strategy. He maintains the\ntraditional view that that-clauses designate propositions,\nbut argues that \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 does not.\nCall phrases of the form \u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019\nproposition descriptions. Proposition descriptions, on this\nview, denote propositional concepts\u2014functions from\nsituations to propositions. This is motivated by a puzzle from Partee\n(1974):\n\nThe number of insect species on Earth is increasing.\n\nThe number of insect species on Earth is 5.5 million.\n\nTherefore, 5.5 million is increasing.\n\nTo explain this argument\u2019s invalidity, Montague (1973) argued\nthat \u2018the number of insect species\u2019 does not denote a\nnumber, but an individual concept\u2014a function from situations\n(world-time pairs) to individuals (in this case, a number). The copula\nin the second premise specifies, rather than equates, the value of the\nindividual concept relative to this situation.\n\nNebel presents an analogous puzzle involving a proposition-like\ndescription:\n\nThe evidence that vaccines cause autism is that vaccines contain\nthiomersal\n\nThe evidence that vaccines cause autism is scant.\n\nTherefore, that vaccines contain thiomersal is scant.\n\nTo explain the invalidity of this argument, Nebel claims that\n\u2018the evidence that \\(p\\)\u2019 does not denote a proposition,\nbut a propositional concept\u2014a function from situations to the\nproposition that provides evidence for \\(p\\) in that situation. The\n\u2018is\u2019 of the first premise again specifies the proposition\nthat is the value of the propositional concept in that situation; it\ndoes not state an identity between \u2018the evidence that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018that \\(q\\)\u2019. In general, all proposition\ndescriptions are said to denote propositional concepts. In the case of\n\u2018the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019, the propositional concept is\na constant function that designates the same proposition in every\nsituation.\n\nNebel supports this view by noting particular uses of proposition\ndescriptions. Compare the following pairs of statements:\n\n1.\n\n\na.\nThe teacher explained the cause of World War I.\nb.\nThe teacher explained the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.\n\n2.\n\n\na.\nSally explained that Fido barks.\nb.\nSally explained the proposition that Fido barks.\n\n\n\nThe members of each pair have different truth conditions, despite the\nassassination of Franz Ferdinand being the cause of WWI, and the\nproposition that Fido barks being the denotation of \u2018that Fido\nbarks\u2019. To explain this, Nebel appeals to the notion of a\nconcealed question; in certain contexts\u2014for instance,\nwhen the complement of \u2018explains\u2019 is a noun\nphrase\u2014the meaning of the noun phrase is given by an\ninterrogative clause. Thus, (1a) means that the teacher explained\nwhat caused World War I. In the same way, the proposition\ndescription in (2b) conceals a question, although it is a murkier, and\noften context-sensitive, matter exactly which question is concealed.\nNebel suggests that Sally explained what the proposition that Fido\nbarks is, means, or involves.\n\nIf proposition descriptions sometimes function as concealed questions,\nthen it is plausible that they share a semantics with interrogative\nclauses. Interrogative clauses have been taken to denote question\nintensions, functions from situations to propositions that truly\nanswer the question in that situation. If this is correct, then\nquestion intensions are just propositional concepts. Nebel takes this\nto provide evidence for his view: If proposition descriptions denote\npropositional concepts (and not propositions), then we should predict\nthat proposition descriptions can be used as concealed questions in\ncontexts which permit interrogative complements, which is what we\nfind.\n\nSince \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018the proposition that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 denote different entities, Nebel\u2019s proposal seems\nable to explain the substitution failures that result from replacing\nproposition descriptions for that-clauses. It would seem,\nhowever, that on his view inferences from \u2018S believes that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 to \u2018S believes the proposition that \\(p\\)\u2019\nwill be invalid. Nebel gives a tentative response that\n\u2018believes\u2019 may be polysemous. Compare the following:\n\n3.\nSally believes that Fido barks.\n4.\nSally believes the proposition that Fido barks.\n5.\nSally believes her mother.\n\n\nIn (3), \u2018believes\u2019 takes a proposition as argument and\nreturns a predicate that is true of Sally iff she believes that\nproposition. In cases like (3), \u2018believes\u2019 takes a\nnon-propositional entity (her mother) as argument and forms a\npredicate that is true of Sally iff she believes some\ncontextually-salient proposition that is associated with her mother.\nNebel proposes that (2) is like (3); in this case, the\ncontextually-salient proposition associated with the propositional\nconcept is that Fido barks. Thus, (1) and (2) have the same truth\nconditions, despite the that-clause and proposition\ndescription denoting different entities.\n\nOne may object that many descriptions which denote proposition-like\nentities (statements, rumors, claims, etc.) can take predicates that\ndon\u2019t apply to abstract objects like propositional concepts. For\nexample, in the sentence \u2018the rumor that Jim consumes peyote is\nvicious,\u2019 the description \u2018the rumor that Jim consumes\npeyote\u2019 is said to denote the function from situations to the\nproposition rumored at that situation. But it seems to be a category\nmistake to say that a propositional concept (or even a proposition) is\nvicious. Similarly, van Elswyk (2022) appeals to points made by\nMoltmann (2013) that certain descriptions permit causal predicates, as\nin \u2018the statement that durian is pungent caused\nastonishment\u2019. On Nebel\u2019s view, \u2018the statement that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 denotes a propositional concept. But if propositional\nconcepts are abstract, then they cannot enter into causal relations.\nOn a more natural reading, the description designates an act of\nstating (or perhaps its product, as Moltmann maintains), which can be\na cause.\n\nFinally, we may ask whether this view can explain the Objectivization\nEffect. If proposition descriptions denote propositional concepts, and\nthese are functions from situations to propositions, then why do we\nget the object readings with proposition descriptions? For \u2018the\nnumber of insect species is increasing\u2019 we do not get an object\nreading for the NP, but a \u201cstructural\u201d reading that makes\nsense if \u2018the number of insects\u2019 denotes an individual\nconcept. The same applies to \u2018the evidence that vaccines cause\nautism is scant\u2019. However, in \u2018John fears the proposition\nthat a bear is behind the tree\u2019, we do not get a structural\nreading. John does not fear the function itself, nor any structural\nfeature of it. We get an objectual reading of the sort King\npredicts.\n",
