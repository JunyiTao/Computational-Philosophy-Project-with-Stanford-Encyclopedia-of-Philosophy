    "main_text": "The Aristocles Passage\n3. The Aristocles Passage\n\nA word, first, about the provenance and evidential value of the\nAristocles passage. Several chapters from book 8 of Aristocles\u2019\nPeri philosophias (On Philosophy) appear in\nquotation in the Praeparatio evangelica of Eusebius, the\nfourth-century bishop of Caesarea. These chapters expound, and then\nattack from an Aristotelian perspective, a number of philosophies that\nimpugn the reliability of one or other of our cognitive faculties.\nAmong these Aristocles counts Pyrrhonism, as represented by Pyrrho\nhimself and by the initiator of the later Pyrrhonist tradition,\nAenesidemus; Aristocles speaks of Aenesidemus (first century BCE,\nq.v.), as recent, and is apparently not aware of any subsequent\nmembers of the Pyrrhonist tradition. The chapter on Pyrrhonism opens\nwith a brief summary of the early Pyrrhonist outlook, as reported by\nTimon, who refers to Pyrrho (14.18.1\u20135).\n\nThis convoluted transmission might lead one to doubt how much\nauthentic information can be extracted from the passage. But there is\nno reason, first, to doubt Eusebius\u2019 explicit claim to be\nquoting Aristocles verbatim. Aristocles is not quoting Timon verbatim;\nsome of the vocabulary in this passage is clearly reminiscent of\nAristocles\u2019 own vocabulary in other chapters. However, other\nterms in the passage are quite distinct both from Aristocles\u2019\nown normal usage and from any of the terminology familiar to us from\nlater Pyrrhonism, yet were in use prior to Timon\u2019s day; it seems\neasiest to account for these as authentic reproductions of\nTimon\u2019s own language. In addition, the frequent mention of Timon\neither by name or by the word ph\u00easi, \u2018he\nsays\u2019, suggests that Aristocles is taking pains to reproduce the\nessentials of his account as faithfully as possible. And finally,\nAristocles\u2019 other chapters, where we are in a position to check\nhis summaries against other evidence of the views being summarized,\nsuggest that he is in general a reliable reporter of other\npeople\u2019s views, even views to which he himself is strongly\nopposed\u2014or at least, that he is reliable when he has access to\nsystematic written expositions of those views, as seems to be the case\nhere. As for Timon\u2019s reliability as a source for Pyrrho\u2019s\nviews, we cannot be sure, but we cannot do better; he is clearly\ncloser to Pyrrho than any other source who discusses him.\nHowever, as already noted, there is a further question concerning how\nfar the passage is a report of Pyrrho\u2019s ideas and how far it gives\nus Timon\u2019s creative development of them.\n\nEven aside from that question, the interpretation of the\nAristocles passage is fraught with controversy. It follows that the\ncharacter of Pyrrho\u2019s thinking is, at its very core, a matter\nfor sharp disagreement. The present survey will begin by assuming that\nthe passage is all about Pyrrho, laying out the two main\nalternatives (given this assumption) and exploring the\nconsequences of each. (Numerous other readings besides these two have\nbeen proposed; in particular, the interpretation of Svavarsson (2004)\nis an intriguing, though arguably unstable, hybrid of the two. But it\nis fair to say that these two are the ones that have commanded by far\nthe most scholarly attention.) It will then explain why some scholars\nhave questioned this assumption, and what difference this would\nmake to our understanding of Pyrrho and of Timon\u2019s\nrelation to him. First, then, on the assumption that the whole\npassage is Timon\u2019s summary of Pyrrho\u2019s thought:\n\nTimon is reported as telling us that in order to be happy, one must\npay attention to three connected questions: first, what are things\nlike by nature? second, how should we be disposed towards things\n(given our answer to the first question)? and third, what will be the\noutcome for those who adopt the disposition recommended in the answer\nto the second question? And the passage then gives us answers to\neach of the three questions in order.\n\nThe answer to the question \u201cwhat are things like by\nnature?\u201d is given by a sequence of three epithets; things are\nsaid to be adiaphora and astathm\u00eata and\nanepikrita. Taken by themselves, these epithets can be\nunderstood in two importantly different ways: they may be taken as\ncharacterizing how things are (by nature) in themselves, or they may\nbe taken as commenting on human beings\u2019 lack (by our nature) of\ncognitive access to things. Adiaphora is normally translated\n\u2018indifferent\u2019. But this might be taken as referring either\nto an intrinsic characteristic of things\u2014namely that, in\nthemselves and by nature, they possess no differentiating features\n\u2014 or to our natural inability to discern any such features. In\nthe latter case \u2018undifferentiable\u2019 might be a more\nperspicuous translation. (Beckwith (2011) plausibly connects the focus\non differentiating features, or the lack of them, with the\nAristotelian notion of differentiae; on either of the readings to be\nexplored, Aristotle\u2019s picture of the world and of our ability to\nunderstand it would indeed be a prime example of the kind of view from\nwhich Pyrrho is anxious to distance himself.) Similarly,\nastathm\u00eata might mean \u2018unstable\u2019 or\n\u2018unbalanced\u2019, describing an objective property of things;\nor it might mean \u2018not subject to being placed on a\nbalance\u2019, and hence \u2018unmeasurable\u2019, which would\nagain place the focus on our cognitive inabilities. And\nanepikrita might mean \u2018indeterminate\u2019, referring\nto an objective lack of any definite features, or\n\u2018indeterminable\u2019, pointing to an inability on our part to\ndetermine the features of things. The statement as a whole, then, is\neither answering the question \u201cwhat are things like by\nnature?\u201d by stating that things are, in their very nature,\nindefinite or indeterminate in various ways \u2014 the precise nature\nof the thesis would be a matter for further speculation\u2014or by\nstating that we human beings are not in a position to pin down or\ndetermine the nature of things. Let us call these the metaphysical and\nthe epistemological interpretations respectively.\n\nIt is clear that the metaphysical interpretation gives us a Pyrrho who\nis not in any recognizable sense a sceptic. Pyrrho, on this\ninterpretation, is issuing a declaration about the nature of things in\nthemselves\u2014precisely what the later Pyrrhonists who called\nthemselves sceptics were careful to avoid. On the epistemological\ninterpretation, on the other hand, Pyrrho is very much closer to the\ntradition that took his name. There is still some distance between\nthem. To say that we cannot determine the nature of things\n\u2014 as opposed to saying that we have so far failed to determine\nthe natural features of things\u2014is already a departure from the\nsceptical suspension of judgement promoted by Sextus Empiricus. And to\nput it, as on this reading Pyrrho does put it, by saying that\nthings are indeterminable, is a further departure, in that it\ndoes attribute at least one feature to things in themselves \u2014\nnamely, being such that humans cannot determine them. Nevertheless,\nthe epistemological interpretation clearly portrays Pyrrho as a\nforerunner\u2014a naive and unsophisticated forerunner, perhaps\n\u2014 of later Pyrrhonist scepticism, whereas the metaphysical\ninterpretation puts him in a substantially different light.\n\nThe natural way to try to choose between these two interpretations is\nto see which of them fits best with the logic of the passage as a\nwhole. Unfortunately, a neutral decision on this does not seem be\npossible. According to the manuscripts, the phrase that\nfollows the words we have been discussing reads \u201cfor\nthis reason (dia touto) neither our sensations nor our\nopinions tell the truth or lie\u201d. On the metaphysical\ninterpretation, the idea would be that, since things are in\ntheir real nature indeterminate, our sensations and opinions, which\nrepresent things as having certain determinate features, are neither\ntrue nor false. They are not true, since reality is not the way they\npresent it as being. It might then seem that they are false. But\nif reality is indeterminate because it is constantly changing\n(as the sensible world is sometimes portrayed, for example, in Plato),\nthen one might say that our perceptions of the fleeting, temporary\nfeatures of things are not simply false. Because these\nfeatures are temporary and fleeting, they do not belong to the real\nnature of things, so the perceptions do not qualify as\ntrue; but (assuming our senses are functioning normally) they are\nfeatures the things do actually manifest on particular occasions.\n\nAs for the epistemological interpretation, some scholars have\nsuggested that the manuscripts are in error at this point, and that\nwhat the text should say is \u201con account of the fact\nthat (dia to) neither our sensations nor our opinions\ntell the truth or lie\u201d. The change is justified on linguistic\ngrounds; it is alleged that the text in the manuscripts as they stand\nis not acceptable Greek. The considerations for and against this\nproposal are technical, and debate has yielded no consensus on this\nquestion. However, it is clear that if one does make this small\nalteration to the text, the direction of the inference is reversed;\nthe point about our sensations and opinions now becomes a reason for\nthe point about the nature of things, not an inference from it. And\nthis, it has been argued, points towards the epistemological\ninterpretation. The idea would then be that, since our sensations and\nopinions fail to be consistent deliverers of true reports (or, for\nthat matter, false reports) about the world around us, there is no\nprospect of our being able to determine the nature of things. However,\neven if we retain the manuscript text, the epistemological reading may\nstill be possible (so Green (2017)). The idea would be that, in order\nfor our sensations and opinions to tell the truth or lie, they would\nhave to do two things: 1) present an appearance of things and 2)\npresent this appearance as how things really are. But since\nwe are not able to determine the latter (as we were just told in the\nstatement about the nature of things), our sensations and opinions\ncannot do this; they can only register appearances, and that is not\nenough for them to tell either truths or falsehoods.\n\nThe immediate inference from the statement about the nature of things,\nthen, is not decisive. And the remainder of the Aristocles\npassage can be also read so as to fit with either the\nmetaphysical or the epistemological reading of his answer to the\nquestion about the nature of things. The Aristocles passage continues\nwith the answer to the second question, namely the question of the\nattitude we should adopt given the answer to the first question. We\nare told, first, that we should not trust our sensations and opinions,\nbut should adopt an unopinionated attitude. On the epistemological\nreading, the significance of this is obvious. But on the metaphysical\nreading, too, we have already been told that our sensations and\nopinions are not true, which is presumably reason enough for us not to\ntrust them; and the unopinionated attitude that is here recommended\nmay be understood as one in which one refrains from positing any\ndefinite characteristics as inherent in the nature of\nthings\u2014given that their real nature is wholly indefinite. (To\nthe objection that this thesis of indefiniteness is itself an opinion,\nit may be replied that doxa, \u2018opinion\u2019, is\nregularly used in earlier Greek philosophy, especially in Parmenides\nand Plato, to refer to those opinions\u2014misguided opinions, in the\nview of these authors\u2014that take on trust a view of the world as\nconforming more or less to the way it appears in ordinary experience.\nIn this usage, the claim that reality is indefinite would not be a\n(mere) opinion, but would be a statement of the truth.)\n\nThe passage now introduces a certain form of speech that is supposed\nto reflect this unopinionated attitude. We are supposed to say\n\u201cabout each single thing that it no more is than is not or both\nis and is not or neither is nor is not\u201d. There are a number of\nintricate questions about the exact relations between the various\nparts of this complicated utterance, and especially about the role and\nsignificance of the \u2018both\u2019 and \u2018neither\u2019\ncomponents. But it is clear that this too is susceptible of being read\nalong the lines of either of the two interpretations introduced above.\nOn the metaphysical interpretation, we are being asked to adopt a form\nof words that reflects the utter indefiniteness of the way things are;\nwe should not say of anything that it is any particular way\nany more than that it is not that way (with \u2018is\u2019\nbeing understood, as commonly in Greek philosophy, as shorthand for\n\u2018is F\u2019, where F stands for any arbitrary\npredicate). On the epistemological interpretation, we are being asked\nto use a manner of speaking that expresses our suspension of judgement\nabout how things are. Sextus Empiricus specifically tells us that\n\u2018no more\u2019 (ou mallon) is a term used by the\nsceptics to express suspension of judgement, and its occurrence in the\nAristocles passage can be taken as an early example of the same type\nof usage.\n\nFinally, in answer to the third question, we are told that the result\nfor those who adopt the unopinionated attitude just recommended is\nfirst aphasia and then ataraxia. Ataraxia,\n\u2018freedom from worry\u2019, is familiar to us from later\nPyrrhonism; this is said by the later Pyrrhonists to be the result of\nthe suspension of judgement that they claimed to be able to induce.\nThe precise sense of aphasia is less clear. Beckwith (2011)\nactually argues that the transmitted text is erroneous, and that we\nshould instead read apatheia, \u201clack of passion\u201d.\nThis is an attractive suggestion; apatheia is indeed a term\nused not infrequently of Pyrrho\u2019s untroubled attitude (see\nsection 5), whereas a reference to aphasia would be\nunparalleled in the other evidence on Pyrrho. However, the proposal is\ninevitably speculative, and aphasia is a term in use in later\nPyrrhonism; it seems worth trying to elucidate it on the assumption\nthat the transmitted text is correct. It might mean\n\u2018non-assertion\u2019, as in Sextus\u2014that is, a refusal to\ncommit oneself to definite alternatives; or it might mean, more\nliterally, \u2018speechlessness\u2019, which could in turn be taken\nto be an initial reaction of stunned silence to the radical position\nwith which one has been presented (an uncomfortable reaction that is\nsubsequently replaced by ataraxia\u2014the passage does say\nthat aphasia comes first and ataraxia comes later).\nBut the decision between these two ways of understanding the term is\nindependent of the broader interpretive issues bearing upon the\npassage as a whole. For some form of \u2018non-assertion\u2019 is\nclearly licensed by either the metaphysical or the epistemological\ninterpretation; and on either interpretation, the view proposed might\nindeed render someone (initially) uncomfortable to the point of\n\u2018speechlessness\u2019. The important point, though, is that\nataraxia is the end result; and this links back to the\nintroductory remark to the effect that the train of thought to be\nsummarized has the effect of making one happy.\n\nWe have, then, two major possibilities. On the one hand, Pyrrho can be\nread as advancing a sweeping metaphysical thesis, that things are in\ntheir real nature indefinite or indeterminate, and encouraging us to\nembrace the consequences of that thesis by refusing to attribute any\ndefinite features to things (at least, as belonging to their real\nnature) and by refusing to accept at face value (again, as revelatory\nof the real nature of things) those myriad aspects of our ordinary\nexperience that represent things as having certain definite features.\nOr, on the other hand, Pyrrho can be read as declaring that the nature\nof things is inaccessible to us, and encouraging us to withdraw our\ntrust (and to speak in such a way as to express our withdrawal of\ntrust) in ordinary experience as a guide to the nature of things. As\nnoted earlier, the second, epistemological interpretation makes\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook a great deal closer to that of the later\nPyrrhonists who took him as an inspiration. But that is not in itself\nany reason for favoring this interpretation over the other,\nmetaphysical one. For on either interpretation Pyrrho is said to\npromise ataraxia, the later Pyrrhonists\u2019 goal, and to\npromise it as a result of a certain kind of withdrawal of\ntrust in the veracity of our everyday impressions of things; the\nconnection between these two points aligns Pyrrho with the later\nPyrrhonists, and sets him apart from every other Greek philosophical\nmovement that preceded later Pyrrhonism. The fact that this later\nsceptical tradition took Pyrrho as an inspiration is therefore readily\nunderstandable whichever of the two interpretations is correct (or\nwhichever they thought was correct). It is also true that, on the\nmetaphysical interpretation of the passage, the grounds on which\nPyrrho advanced his metaphysical thesis of indeterminacy are never\nspecified; this too, like the precise character of the thesis itself,\nmust be a matter for speculative reconstruction. But Aristocles only\npurports to be giving the key points of Timon\u2019s summary; the\nlack of detail, though disappointing, would not be surprising.\n\nSo far we have assumed that the Aristocles passage is supposed to\nrepresent the thought of Pyrrho. But, as noted earlier, some scholars\nhave questioned that assumption (see especially Brunschwig\n(1994), Marchand (2018)). Their reason is that there is only one place\nin the Aristocles passage that reads \u201cTimon says that Pyrrho says\n\u2026\u201d; this is the threefold statement about the nature of things.\nElsewhere Aristocles says \u201cTimon says\u201d, but nowhere else are we\nspecifically told that Timon is conveying the thought of Pyrrho.\nAdmittedly Aristocles introduces Pyrrho as one of those who question\nour ability to know things, but he may have thought that Timon\u2019s own\n(written) ideas are the closest we can get to Pyrrho\u2019s (unwritten)\nideas. Hence it is not obvious that anything beyond the threefold\nstatement about the nature of things should actually be attributed to\nPyrrho himself. Of course, when Aristocles says \u201cTimon says\u201d, he\nmay have meant this as short for \u201cTimon says Pyrrho says\u201d,\nbut he may also have intended to distinguish between the contributions\nof Pyrrho and of Timon.\n\nIf we limit Pyrrho\u2019s contribution in this way, what difference does it\nmake? There is still the question whether the statement about the\nnature of things is about how things are in themselves or about\nour inability to grasp them. But in this case, all the mention of\nsensations and opinions, of their truth or falsehood, and of what we\nshould say belongs to Timon, not to Pyrrho. And this opens the\npossibility that the main philosophical outlook expressed in the\nAristocles passage, whether one reads it metaphysically or\nepistemologically, is Timon\u2019s construction, building on a single idea\nof Pyrrho\u2019s that may have been rather less broad in scope or ambitious\nin character. In particular, as we shall see, much of the other\nevidence on Pyrrho seems to depict him as focused on questions of\nvalue, questioning our characterizations of things as good or bad\nand doubting whether our views on such matters are stable or\nreliable. His statement of the \u201cindifferent\u201d nature of things, as\nreported in the Aristocles passage, may also have been of an\nevaluative kind: things do not really \u2014 or, we cannot tell\nwhether things really \u2014 have the positive or negative evaluative\nqualities we accord them.\n",
