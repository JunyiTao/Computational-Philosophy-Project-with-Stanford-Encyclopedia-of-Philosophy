    "main_text": "Laws and Theories || Laws\n7.1 Laws\n\nIn both papers on laws, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a72; 1929b, [FM]\n237\u201338) considers accidental generalization to be conjunctions\n([NP], n. 40; cf. Ramsey 1927a, [FM] 152\u201353) and thus normal\npropositions (for the relation to Wittgenstein, see\n \u00a72).\n In \u201cUniversals of Law and Fact\u201d, Ramsey (1928b, \u00a712)\nconsiders laws of nature to be propositions with a special status:\n\n[E]ven if we knew everything, we should still want to systematize our\nknowledge as a deductive system, and the general axioms in that system\nwould be the fundamental laws of nature. The choice of axioms is bound\nto some extent to be arbitrary, but what is less likely to be\narbitrary if any simplicity is to be preserved is a body of\nfundamental generalizations, some to be taken as axioms and others\ndeduced.\n\n\nThus laws of nature are the axioms and theorems in the simplest\naxiomatization of all of our knowledge. And while we currently do not\nknow everything, we can still find the simplest axiomatization for\nwhat we do know and what we expect to come to know (\u00a716).\nFollowing Lewis (1973 [1986], \u00a73.3), a similar view of laws has\nbeen developed and discussed as the \u201cBest System\u201d account\nof laws, which, however, does not demand that we find the simplest\naxiomatization of all our knowledge, but rather of as much of\nour knowledge as is possible while retaining a high enough level of\nsimplicity (see also Carroll 2016, \u00a72).\n\n\u201cGeneral Propositions and Causality\u201d, written in the\nsummer of 1929 (Braithwaite 1931, xiii) and with additional notes from\nSeptember 1929 ([NP] note 74), explicitly retracts the view that laws\n(here called \u2018variable hypotheticals\u2019) are propositions\n(1929b, [FM] 238; for the relation to Weyl, see\n \u00a72).\n Rather (1929b, [FM] 241):\n\nVariable hypotheticals are not judgments but rules for judging\n\u2018If I meet a \\(\\phi\\), I shall regard it as a \\(\\psi\\)\u2019.\nThis cannot be negated but it can be disagreed with\nby one who does not adopt it.\n\n\nThus variable hypotheticals \u201cform the system with which the\nspeaker meets the future\u201d in that \u201cwe trust [a conjunction\nof their instances] to guide us in a new instance\u201d exactly\nbecause the conjunction is evidence for the variable hypothetical.\nSimplicity may still play a role, but not as constitutive of laws (as\nin the earlier, Best System account), rather only as epistemic\njustification for adopting a rule of judgment (1929b, [FM] 242). This\nallows again for the non-arbitrariness if not uniqueness of laws.\nUnknown laws are those rules of judgment whose adoption is justified\nby unknown facts (1929b, [FM] 243\u201345).\n\nIn both papers, \u2018if \u2026 then \u2026\u2019 statements,\ncalled \u2018conditionals\u2019, are taken to differ from material\nimplications in that they can be inferred from the system of laws\n(1928b, \u00a715; 1929b, [FM] 248). Ramsey (1929b, [FM] 249) takes\nconditionals to encompass both the indicative and subjunctive mood\n(see \u00a75 on Conditionals) and he identifies causal laws with\nconditionals in which the event described in the antecedent takes\nplace before the event described in the consequent.\n\nRamsey\u2019s earlier, Best System account of laws fits well with\nHumean constraints of metaphysics (Carroll 2016, \u00a72), and Ramsey\n(1929b, [FM] 252\u201353; 254\u201355, n. 4) is explicit that his\nlater, non-propositional account of laws avoids \u201creal\nconnections of universals\u201d and is in the spirit of Hume. At\nfirst Ramsey (1928b, \u00a715) even states that the material\nimplication is all we practically need, while later acknowledging that\nconditionals are necessary for assigning praise and blame (1929b, [FM]\n245\u201346).\n",
