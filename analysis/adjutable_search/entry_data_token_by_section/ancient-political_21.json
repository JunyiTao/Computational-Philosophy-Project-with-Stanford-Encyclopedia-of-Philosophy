    "main_text": "The Roman Republic and Cicero || Cicero: Life\n6.1 Cicero: Life\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) was the most famous\n\u201chomo novus\u201d or new man of Roman politics, hailing from a\nminor provincial landowning family rather than the great clans of\nhereditary nobility. He rose to the office of consul and the lifetime\nSenatorial membership it subsequently conferred by his audacious wit\nas a lawyer and orator in public prosecutions. His greatest moment as\nconsul in 63 BCE came in exposing a conspiracy by Catiline; the brutal\nsuppression of the conspiracy by executing Roman citizens without\ntrial, however, would tar his political legacy. He became an enemy of\nJulius Caesar (though accepting a pardon from him at the end of a\nstretch of civil wars in 47 BCE), seeing the assertion of power first\nby Caesar and then Marc Antony as fatal to the republic. Having\ndefended in his De officiis the kind of tyrannicide that he\ntook the killing of Caesar in 44 BCE to have constituted, and attacked\nAntony mercilessly in his series of fourteen Philippics the\nfollowing year, Cicero was murdered in response by partisans of the\nthen-ruling Triumvirate to which Antony belonged.\n\nThe writings of Cicero were virtually canonized subsequent to his\ndeath as classic models of rhetoric and philosophy; as Richard Tuck\n(1990: 43) has remarked, \u201cFor fifteen hundred years, from the\nfourth century to the nineteenth, schoolchildren in Europe were\nexposed daily to two books. One was the Bible, and the other was the\nworks of Cicero.\u201d His many speeches and letters are themselves\nof considerable political and often philosophical interest, reworking\nthe evaluative vocabulary of Roman law and politics in ways which\nsuited his overarching (and changing) political purposes (for a\ncritical assessment, see Gildenhard 2011, which concludes that\n\u201cIn his rhetoric Cicero...consistently refused to recognize the\npositions of his adversaries as genuine political positions and\nchallenged their identities as senatorial peers, Roman citizens, or\neven human beings \u201d(Gildenhard 2011: 390). While his\nphilosophical writings\u2014composed for the most part as a student\nof philosophy in Rome and Athens, and then in a brief period\n(46\u201344 BCE) when political developments led him to retreat from\nactive public life\u2014cover a wide range of topics, including for\nexample, among those especially relevant to politics are two works on\nthe political role of the orator and the nature of oratory or\nrhetoric, celebrating the moral purposes of the orator as essential to\nthe success of republican government.\n\nWhile Cicero adhered to a moderate skepticism in general philosophical\nmatters, he would draw on a number of Stoic ideas in formulating his\nown ethical and political teachings: these were shaped by the lectures\nhe had attended by the Stoic Posidonius in Rhodes, the writings of\nPosidonius\u2019 teacher Panaetius and other earlier and contemporary\nStoic texts, as well as (we may speculate) conversation with the Stoic\nDiodotus whom he accommodated in his household in Rome for many years.\nIn particular, Cicero emphasized the Stoic themes of the natural\naffinity for society and the existence of natural law. At the same\ntime, Platonic themes and models were also important in his political\nwritings (for overall interpretations, Atkins 2020, Schofield 2021).\nThe discussion below is limited to the two dialogues which are\nexplicitly modeled on Plato\u2019s Republic and\nLaws, titled by Cicero in Latin De re publica and\nDe legibus ( On the Commonwealth and On the\nLaws), together with his most important work on political ethics,\nthe De officiis (On Duties), which exercised\nparticular influence on subsequent Western moral and political\nthought.\n",
