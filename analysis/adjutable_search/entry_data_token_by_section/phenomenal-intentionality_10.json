    "main_text": "Arguments for PIT || Assessability for accuracy\n4.2 Assessability for accuracy\n\nSiewert (1998) argues for Weak PIT by arguing that phenomenal states are\nautomatically assessable for accuracy. A key element of\nSiewert\u2019s argument is his assumption that phenomenal characters\ncan be identified with \u201chow it seems for it to look some way to\nsomeone\u201d. We take this to mean that phenomenal states are states\nof things seeming a certain way, where the relevant kind of seeming is\nthe kind we are familiar with from cases where things look a certain\nway in perception (perhaps there are other kinds of seemings that are\nnot phenomenal states). Siewert\u2019s argument is contained in the\nfollowing passage, in which we have added numbers corresponding to the\npremises:\n\n\nFirst, consider some instance of its seeming to you as it does for it\nto look as if something is shaped and situated in a certain way, such\nas its seeming to you just as it does on a given occasion for it to\nlook as if there is something X-shaped in a certain position. (1) If\nit seems this way to you, then it appears to follow that it does look\nto you as if there is something X-shaped in a certain position. (3) If\nthis is right, then its seeming this way to you is a feature in virtue\nof which you are assessable for accuracy\u2014(5) that is to say, it\nis an intentional feature. For, from what we have said, (2) if it\nseems to you as it does for it to look this way, then, if it is also\nthe case that there is something X-shaped in a certain position, it\nfollows that the way it looks to you is accurate. (Siewert 1998: 221)\n\n\n\nSiewert suggests that this argument straightforwardly generalizes to a\nlarge number of perceptual experiences. \n\nLet S be the phenomenal state in which it seems to you just as\nit does on a given occasion for it to look as if there is something\nX-shaped in a certain position. The argument in the above quotation can be\nbroken down as follows: \n\n Necessarily, if you are in S, it looks to\nyou as if things are a certain way W, in virtue of being in\nS. \n Necessarily, if it looks to you as if things are in\nway W, things being (or not being) W would make you\naccurate (or inaccurate). \n Therefore, if you are in S, you are\nassessable for accuracy with respect to things being W, in\nvirtue of being in S. \n If you are assessable for accuracy in virtue of\nbeing in a certain state, this state has intentional content. \n Necessarily, S has intentional content.\n\n\nSiewert does not explicitly defend premises\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n (4) is defended in section 6.2 of the book.\n\nOne might object that\n (3)\n does not follow from\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n Perhaps S is such that, necessarily, things being a certain\nway (or not) would make the bearer of S accurate (or not), but\nit is not in virtue of being in S that its bearer is\nassessable for accuracy. The assessability might come from the\ninevitable addition of an interpretation to S in all\ncircumstances. Siewert argues against this possibility extensively\nbetween pages 222 and 245, ruling out various sources of\ninterpretation. \n\nGertler (2001) objects that there is an alternative explanation of\nSiewert\u2019s observations about the co-occurrence of phenomenal and\nintentional properties: intentional properties automatically give rise\nto phenomenal properties. Gertler argues that Siewert has not ruled\nout this alternative, and so fails to establish PIT. See Siewert 2004 for a response.\n",
