Sources and First Expressions: Al-Kind\u00ee and Razi\n\n\n Aristotle's philosophy of mind in\nIslamic philosophy is a combination of what we would today call\npsychology and physiology, and is not limited to investigations of our\nrational faculty. However important, the \u201cmind\u201d or\nintellect, with its practical and theoretical aspects, is only part of\nthe fal\u00e2sifa's \u201cscience of the\nsoul.\u201d Their main sources are found in three Aristotelian\ntreatises: On the Soul (De anima), On Sense and Sensibilia\n(De Sensu et Sensibili), and On Memory and Recollection\n(De Memoria et Reminiscentia). The last two belong to a series\nof nine short physical treatises, called accordingly Parva\nNaturalia, and include two that deal with the related topic of\ndreams and prophesying by means of dreams.\n\n\n The De anima was fully translated\ninto Arabic in the ninth century C.E., the Parva Naturalia\npartially translated, including those treatises relevant to our topic.\nMuslim authors had access to Arabic translations of Hellenistic\ncommentaries on these works, particularly those done by Alexander of\nAphrodisias (third century c.e.) and Themistius (fourth\n century).[1]\nThe views of the\nMuslim philosophers reflect these various sources, and are\nthus \u201cAristotelian\u201d in an attenuated sense, particularly as\nconcerns the role and entailments of the rational faculty.\n\n\n The scientifically rich Hellenistic\nculture to which Islam was heir is evident in the work of Ab\u00fb\nY\u00fbsuf Ya\u2018q\u00fbb ibn Ish\u00e2q al-Kind\u00ee (d. c.870) and Ab\u00fb\nBakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyya ibn Yahya al-R\u00e2z\u00ee (865-925 or 932).\nAl-Kind\u00ee, known as \u201cthe philosopher of the Arabs\u201d for\nhis Arabian genealogy, was active, with others of his circle, in\nediting Arabic translations and paraphrases of both Aristotelian and\nNeoplatonic texts. He also was familiar with other branches of Greek\nscience, and wrote treatises on many diverse topics. His views on\npsychology were formed mainly by acquaintance with paraphrases made of\nDe anima, the Theology of Aristotle (An abridgement of\nPlotinus' Enneads) and the Book on the Pure Good (an\nabridgement of Proclus' Elements of Theology, known in Latin as\nLiber De Causis). An Arabic version of Euclid's Optics\nalso helped al-Kind\u00ee develop his theory of vision, expressed in his\nDe Aspectibus and two smaller treatises (extant in Arabic\nonly). Unfortunately, al-Kind\u00ee does not integrate his understanding\nof vision with other aspects of his psychology, the parts never\namounting to a whole, complete system. We have instead a fragmentary\nreport indicating directions in which al-Kind\u00ee was headed, and\nprobable sources with which he had some acquaintance.\n\n\n Thus, the De Aspectibus shows that\nal-Kind\u00ee favored an extramission view of vision, in which rays\nextend from the eyes to make contact with an object, enabling a person\nto see\n it.[2]\nFollowing Euclid's Optics ultimately, al-Kind\u00ee offers\ngeometrical demonstrations against both the alternative\n\u201cintromission\u201d view, and the view that fuses extramission\nwith intromission; views identified mostly with Aristotle's\nDe anima and Plato's Timaeus, respectively. In\nother treatises, however, al-Kind\u00ee may be more sympathetic to\nAristotle's understanding of vision, mixed with possible\nfamiliarity with relevant treatises of Ptolemy and John Philoponus.\n\n\n Al-Kind\u00ee's exposure to Plato and\nAristotle was through doxographies and paraphrases that attempted to\nharmonize their views, and that often grafted Gnostic and hermetic\nthemes onto a Platonic\u2014more exactly \n Neoplatonic\u2014trunk.[3]\nThus, his Statement\non the\n Soul,[4]\nwhich purports to give a summary of the views on the subject of\n\u201cAristotle, Plato, and other Philosophers,\u201d emphasizes the\nimmortal nature of the soul; its origins as a tripartite unified\nsubstance created by God, which returns through various heavenly stages\nto be in proximity to its Creator, upon having lived a life controlled\nby its rational faculty. Indeed, the superior person\n(f\u00e2dil) who abjures physical desires and pursues wisdom\n(hikmah), justice, goodness and truth (these following from\nknowledge) resembles the\n Creator.[5]\nThis resemblance is elsewhere qualified to\npertain to God's activities, not to His\n essence.[6]\nAristotle is seen as in agreement\nwith this essential separation of soul and body, and the ability of the\nsoul to know things not given to empirical investigation.\n\n\n Al-Kind\u00ee is more conventional\nphilosophically in his magnum opus, On First Philosophy, when\nhe highlights the mechanics of perception as proceeding from the\nsensible object (via the sense organs) to the common sense, imagination\nand\n memory.[7]\nElsewhere, he mentions the role of the imagination in both abstracting\nand presenting images apart from their matter (Ivry, 135). The\nintellect deals with universals, as mentioned in On First Philosophy,\nwhereas particular, material objects are treated by the senses (and,\npresumably, the imagination and memory).\n\n\n The divergent sources present in\nAl-Kind\u00ee make their appearance again in his short treatise\nOn\n Intellect.[8]\nAristotle's Hellenistic commentators had long since elaborated on\nBook Three of his De anima, and discerned stages of cognition that the\nmaster had left too vague for their liking. In al-Kind\u00ee's\ncase, John Philoponus appears to have provided a model for\nal-Kind\u00ee's scheme of four kinds of intellect (Jolivet, pp.\n50\u201373; Endress, 197). The first intellect is that which is in act\nalways, a separate principle of intelligibility that contains the\nspecies and genera, i.e., the universals, of our world. This first\nintellect, like that of Alexander of\n Aphrodisias,[9]\nendows our potential intellects\n(the second intellect) with the abstract ideas they are capable of\nreceiving; which ideas become part of a (third) acquired but passive\nintellect. When active, however, the (fourth) intellect emerges as just\nthat, an intellect in act, in which its subject is united with its\nobject. As such, the first and fourth intellects are alike\nphenomenologically, though different quantitatively.\n\n\n The first and fourth intellects do not\nconjoin, though al-Kind\u00ee would have the perfect soul ascend to its\ncreator. Similarly, he is not explicit as to the relationship of the\nimagination and intellect; the imaginative forms, recognized as\npartially abstracted from matter, should provide the raw material for\nthe intellect, but it is not at all clear they do. The Platonic\ndisparagement of sensibilia may have affected al-Kind\u00ee here,\nleaving his psychology ultimately dualistic.\n\n\n Al-Raz\u00ee, known to the Latin West as Rhazes\nand hence referred to usually as Razi, was similarly drawn to a\nPlatonically inspired view of the soul, colored by theosophic accounts\nof creation and salvation. While he agreed with Plato's notion of\na tripartite soul, Razi often spoke of three souls, the rational or\ndivine one enlisting the higher passions of the animal soul to control\nthe base appetites of the vegetative\n soul.[10]\nFollowing Hellenistic\ntradition, he locates the vegetative soul in the liver, the animal soul\nin the heart and the rational soul in the brain. While the physical\norgans of the two subordinate souls are sufficient to account for their\nactivities, the brain\u2014seat of sensation, voluntary movement,\nimagination, thought and memory\u2014is regarded merely as an\ninstrument of the rational soul, which is non-physical and\nimmortal.\n\n\n In an introductory medical treatise, Razi\ngoes into further physiological detail concerning the responsibilities\nof the various psychic organs. The special faculties required for the\nbrain to exercise its soul's dominion are identified as the\nimagination (here called wahm, a term that Avicenna was to\nadopt and expand upon); a cogitative power (al-fikr); and\nmemory (al-hifz).\n\n\n While Razi constructed his psychology with\neclectic borrowings from Plato, Galen and Aristotle, he is reported to\nhave gone further afield in metaphysics. He believed there were five\neternal cosmic principles, one of which was a world soul that needed\ndivine intervention to liberate it from the seductive and defiling\nmatter of the\n world.[11]\nThis is similar to the message he presents in\nAl-Tibb al-Ruh\u00e2n\u00ee, that the immortal rational soul of\nan individual must strive to free itself from corporeal entanglements,\nlest it be reincarnated in another, not necessarily human, body.\n\n\n Razi's mythically based metaphysics,\ncoupled with his belief in the transmigration of the soul and a bold\nindifference to identifiably Islamic tenets, led to his marginalization\namong the faithful and philosophers alike. Nevertheless, Razi as well\nas al-Kind\u00ee sketched the components of cognition that later\nphilosophers were to develop.\n",
