    "main_text": "Du Boisian Double-Consciousness after Souls? || Dusk of Dawn (1940)\n4.3 Dusk of Dawn (1940)\n\nThere is a discussion of something like double-consciousness in Du\nBois\u2019s book Dusk of Dawn, published in 1940, two years\nafter Du Bois turned seventy. Indeed, since Dusk of Dawn is\nmore nearly autobiographical in design than Souls (its\nsubtitle is An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race\nConcept) it\u2019s not surprising that Du Bois writes more\nexpansively there of black life in conditions of segregation and white\nsupremacy, even though he doesn\u2019t use the term employed in\nSouls. But also, by this time, his conception of race itself\nhas opened up even further beyond that of any linear historical\ndevelopment. As he writes at the end of the central chapter of that\nbook, \u201cThe Concept of Race\u201d,\n\nIt had as I have tried to show all kinds of illogical trends and\nirreconcilable tendencies. Perhaps it is wrong to speak of it at all\nas \u201ca concept\u201d rather than as a group of contradictory\nforces, facts, and tendencies. (1940: 133)\n\n\nA number of things change in the account given by Du Bois in Dusk\nof Dawn of the phenomena that, in Souls, are brought\nunder the sign of double-consciousness.\n\nThe first is that the Dusk of Dawn treatment of the issues is\nsubsumed much more fully under a thematics of\n\u201cenvironment\u201d, articulated as socio-political,\ngeographical, and cultural in its dimensions, and both dynamic and\nrelatively stable in historical terms. Writing about \u201cthe facts\nof the Negro\u2019s double environment\u201d, Du Bois explains:\n\nThe Negro American has for his environment not only the white\nsurrounding world, but also, and touching him usually much more nearly\nand compellingly, is the environment furnished by his own colored\ngroup. There are exceptions, of course, but this is the rule. The\nAmerican Negro, therefore, is surrounded and conditioned by the\nconcept which he has of white people and he is treated in accordance\nwith the concept they have of him. On the other hand, so far as his\nown people are concerned, he is in direct contact with individuals and\nfacts. (1940: 173)\n\n\nThis way of putting it is prefigured in the \u201cFaith\u201d text\nof Souls, in which Du Bois writes of the \u201cdouble\nlife\u201d of Black folk and of the \u201cworlds within and without\nthe Veil of Color\u201d. Note also the claim that, while the\ninhabitants of the \u201cwhite world\u201d and the \u201ccolored\nworld\u201d look at one other each through \u201cthe concept\u201d\nthey have of one another, individuals within the \u201ccolored\nworld\u201d know each other through \u201cdirect contact\u201d.\nThis is the impact of the veil, the color line. Writing of his own\npersonal experience, Du Bois details the effect of this environing\nwhite world on him:\n\nI was by long education and continual compulsion and daily reminder, a\ncolored man in a white world; and that white world often existed\nprimarily, so far as I was concerned, to see with sleepless vigilance\nthat I was kept within bounds. All this made me limited in physical\nmovement and provincial in thought and dream. I could not stir, I\ncould not act, I could not live, without taking into careful daily\naccount the reaction of my white environing world. (1940: 135\u20136)\n\n\nThere is in this account, in addition to the definite limitation of\npossibilities imposed by the veil \u2013 and consequent to it \u2013\nan active appropriation, and employment in strategic thinking by Du\nBois, of the understanding he has of the white world. This suggests\nanother, practical mode in which double consciousness \u2013 which is\nwhat we are dealing with here \u2013 can operate. If double\nconsciousness also is practical consciousness, \u201ctaking\ninto careful daily account\u201d whites\u2019 reactions \u2013\ntinged as they are by prejudice, by expectations grounded in that\nprejudice \u2013 in one\u2019s plans, one\u2019s own expectations,\nthat would not necessarily involve internalizing the prejudicial\nracist viewpoint itself, though it might nonetheless produce profound\ndisturbance of the soul. Double consciousness would then also yield a\npractical, and affective, rather than a strictly cognitive, impact of\nthe environing conditions on the black soul.\n\nThere is also, on the Dusk of Dawn account, a further, more\ntelling and insidious effect of the white world on the black soul,\nhere exemplified by Du Bois:\n\n\u2026 this fact of racial distinction based on color was the\ngreatest thing in my life and absolutely determined it, because this\nsurrounding group, in alliance and agreement with the white European\nworld, was settled and determined upon the fact that I was and must be\na thing apart. It was impossible to gainsay this. It was impossible\nfor any time and to any distance to withdraw myself and look down upon\nthese absurd assumptions with philosophical calm and humorous\nself-control. (1940: 136)\n\n\nThe \u201cabsurd assumptions\u201d can and do infiltrate the\nNegro\u2019s psyche, affecting how she thinks and feels about herself\nin ways that stubbornly resist her own efforts to override or ignore\nthem. More rarely, perhaps, they elicit fierce and abiding anger, even\nrage. Writing in a less autobiographical vein, Du Bois notes that\ndespair of racial progress \u201ctoo often\u201d results from the\nNegro\u2019s \u201clack of faith in essential Negro possibilities\nparallel to similar attitudes on the part of the whites\u201d. This\nattitude itself is, he continues, \u201ca natural phenomenon\u201d,\nsince Negroes share \u201caverage American culture and current\nAmerican prejudices\u201d. Because of this, it is\n\nalmost impossible for a Negro boy trained in a white Northern high\nschool and a white college to come out with any high idea of his own\npeople or any abiding faith in what they can do. (1940: 191)\n\n\nThis, arguably, is Du Boisian double-consciousness as set out in\nSouls.\n\nBut the 1940 text never asserts a basic inner duality within the\nNegro: missing entirely from the Dusk of Dawn account is any\nmention of inward two-ness, of the psychic splitting that was so\ncrucial to the account given in Souls. In the 1940 text the\nissue is characterized in the terminology of \u201cNegro\nself-criticism\u201d (1940: 179), a \u201clack of faith in essential\nNegro possibilities\u201d (1940: 191), and the \u201cinner\ncontradiction and frustration which [segregation and white racist\nintransigence] involves\u201d (1940: 187) \u2013 a terminology that\nconveys the ambivalence and complexity of the earlier text, but falls\nfar short of asserting an overriding psychic duality. And this is not\nbecause the text does not address the \u201cfelt experience\u201d of\nbeing black in America: the central, longest, chapter in Dusk of\nDawn is \u201cThe Colored World Within\u201d.\n\nThere are, \u2018naturally\u2019, problems with the unitary\nconsciousness of a soul within the double environment Du Bois depicts,\nbut these fall short of causing a split in the psyche itself. There is\nresentment, frustration, and anger; there is a faithlessness, and,\noften, consequent despair; there are the temptations to turning\none\u2019s back on \u2018the folk\u2019; and also temptations to\nreject absolutely anything the \u201cenvironing\u201d white world\noffers or proposes. And there is what Du Bois calls\n\nthat bitter inner criticism of Negroes directed in upon themselves,\nwhich is widespread. It tends often to fierce, angry, contemptuous\njudgment of nearly all that Negroes do, say, and believe\u2026.\n(1940: 179)\n\n\nWhat two-ness there is in the Dusk of Dawn account has been\nrelocated from the inwardness of souls to the \u201cenvironing\u201d\nworld.\n\nThere are two other ways the Dusk of Dawn account diverges\nsignificantly from that of Souls. First, the brute facticity\nof what Du Bois calls the \u201cinferiority\u201d of the colored\nworld is asserted in this text explicitly, and its effect upon the\nattitudes of Negroes described tellingly. Du Bois presents this stark\nreality as undeniable, while at the same time rejecting the related\nclaims made by racist prejudice:\n\nIt is true, as I have argued, that Negroes are not inherently ugly nor\ncongenitally stupid. They are not naturally criminal and their poverty\nand ignorance today have clear and well-known and remediable causes.\nAll this is true: and yet what every colored man living today knows is\nthat by practical present measurements Negroes today are inferior to\nwhites. The white folk of the world are richer and more intelligent;\nthey live better; have better government; have better legal systems;\nhave built more impressive cities; larger systems of communication and\nthey control a larger part of the earth than all the colored peoples\ntogether. (1940: 173\u20134)\n\n\nBy invoking these facts, Du Bois is citing historically contingent yet\npalpably certain realities that, he claims, \u201cevery colored man\nliving today knows\u201d. Consequently, \u201cNegro\nself-criticism\u201d is, in part, grounded in \u201ca perfectly\nobvious fact\u201d (1940: 179), \u201cthat most Negroes in the\nUnited States today occupy a low cultural status\u201d and a\n\u201clow social condition\u201d (1940: 180). Among these, he\ndiscusses \u201cNegro ignorance\u201d, death rate, \u201ccriminal\ntendencies\u201d, poverty, and \u201csocial degradation\u201d. Du\nBois lists these not as representations of white prejudice but in\nacknowledgment of patent observable realities. Though their causes,\npresent and past, count against the prejudiced conclusions often drawn\nin the white world, these causes are less visible, less obvious.\n\nAnother important departure of Dusk of Dawn from\nSouls is an explicit recognition in the later text that the\npsychic phenomena attributed to Negro Americans are not distinctive of\ntheir experience alone. Du Bois writes,\n\n[s]imilar phenomena may be noticed always among undeveloped or\nsuppressed peoples or groups undergoing extraordinary experience. None\nhave more pitilessly castigated the Jews than the Jewish prophets,\nancient and modern. (1940: 179)\n\n\nHe goes on to cite as further cases the Irish and the Germans of the\nSturm und Drang period. In 1940 Du Bois makes a broader\nhistorical claim, that \u201cthe imprisoning of a human group with\nchains in the hands of an environing group\u201d was not \u201ca\nsingularly unusual characteristic of the Negro in the United States in\nthe nineteenth century\u201d, but, rather, \u201cthe majority of\nmankind has struggled through this inner spiritual\nslavery\u2026\u201d (1940: 137).\n",
