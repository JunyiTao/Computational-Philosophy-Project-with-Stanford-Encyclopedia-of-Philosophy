    "main_text": "Pragmatic Arguments\n1. Pragmatic Arguments\n\nAs with so much in philosophy, the first recorded employment of a\npragmatic argument is found in Plato. At Meno 86b-c, Socrates\ntells Meno that believing in the value of inquiry is justified because\nof the positive impact upon one\u2019s character:\n\n\nMeno: Somehow or other I believe you are right.\n\nSocrates: I think I am. I shouldn\u2019t like to take my oath on the\nwhole story, but one thing I am ready to fight for as long as I can,\nin word and act \u2013 that is, that we shall be better, braver, and\nmore active men if we believe it right to look for what we don\u2019t\nknow than if we believe there is no point in looking because what we\ndon\u2019t know we can never discover.\n\nMeno: There too I am sure you\n are.[1]\n\n\nParaphrased, Socrates\u2019 point is if being better, braver, and\nmore active are among our desires, and if believing that inquiry is\nworthwhile facilitates our becoming better, braver, and more active,\nthen we have reason, pragmatic reason, to believe that inquiry is\nworthwhile. Socrates\u2019 argument is an argument for the\npermissibility of a certain belief, based on the benefits of believing\nthat certain belief. Pragmatic arguments are practical in orientation,\njustifying actions that are thought to facilitate the achievement of\nour goals, or the satisfaction of our desires. If among your goals is\nA, and if doing such and such results in your achieving\nA, then, all else being equal, you have reason to do such and\nsuch:\n\nDoing \u03b1 brings about, or contributes in bringing about,\n\u03b2, and\nIt is in your interest that \u03b2 obtain. So,\nYou have reason to do \u03b1.\n\n\nAs presented this is a particular kind of pragmatic argument, a\nprudential argument. Prudential pragmatic arguments are predicated\nupon one\u2019s preferences or goals or self-interest. As we will\nsee, there are pragmatic arguments that are not narrowly prudential\nbut are moral in nature.\n\nPragmatic arguments are relevant to belief-formation, since\ninculcating a belief is an action. There are, broadly speaking, two\nkinds of pragmatic arguments that have to do with belief-formation.\nThe first is an argument that recommends taking steps to believe a\nproposition because, if it should turn out to be true, the benefits\ngained from believing that proposition will be impressive. This first\nkind of pragmatic argument we can call a \u201ctruth-dependent\u201d\npragmatic argument, or more conveniently a\n\u201cdependent-argument,\u201d since the benefits are obtained only\nif the relevant state of affairs occurs. The prime example of a\ndependent-argument is a pragmatic argument that uses a calculation of\nexpected utility and employs the Expectation Rule to recommend\nbelief:\n\nwhenever both probability and utility values are known, one should\nchoose to do an act which has the greatest expected utility.\n\n\nAmong the various versions of his wager argument, Pascal employs this\nRule in a version which states that no matter how small the\nprobability that God exists, as long as it is a positive, non-zero\nprobability, the expected utility of theistic belief will dominate the\nexpected utility of disbelief. Given the distinction between (A)\nhaving reason to think a certain proposition is true, and (B) having\nreason to induce belief in that proposition, taking steps to generate\nbelief in a certain proposition may be the rational thing to do, even\nif that proposition lacks sufficient evidential support. The benefits\nof believing a proposition can rationally take precedence over the\nevidential strength enjoyed by a contrary proposition; and so, given\nan infinite expected utility, Pascal\u2019s Wager contends that\nforming the belief that God exists is the rational thing to do, no\nmatter how small the likelihood that God exists.\n\nThe second kind of pragmatic argument, which can be called a\n\u201ctruth-independent\u201d pragmatic argument, or more\nconveniently, an \u201cindependent-argument,\u201d is one which\nrecommends taking steps to believe a certain proposition simply\nbecause of the benefits gained by believing it, whether or not the\nbelieved proposition is true. This is an argument that recommends\nbelief cultivation because of the psychological, or moral, or\nreligious, or social, or even the prudential benefits gained by virtue\nof believing it. In David Hume\u2019s Dialogues Concerning\nNatural Religion, for example, Cleanthes employs an independent\nargument, \u201creligion, however corrupted, is still better than no\nreligion at all. The doctrine of a future state is so strong and\nnecessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or\nneglect it\u201d (Hume 1776, 87). Perhaps the best-known example of\nan independent-argument is found in William James\u2019s celebrated\n\u201cWill to Believe\u201d essay in which he argues that, in\ncertain circumstances, it is rationally and morally permissible to\nbelieve a proposition because of the benefits thereby\n generated.[2]\n\nUnlike independent pragmatic arguments, dependent ones are, in an\nimportant sense, truth-sensitive. Of course, being pragmatic\narguments, dependent-arguments are not truth-sensitive in an\nevidential sense; nevertheless they are dependent on truth since the\nbenefits are had only if the recommended belief is true. In contrast,\nindependent pragmatic arguments, yielding benefits whether or not the\nrecommended beliefs are true, are insensitive to truth.\nIndependent-arguments, we might say, are belief-dependent and not\ntruth-dependent.\n\nTheism is the proposition that God exists. A theist is anyone\nwho accepts or believes that proposition. In this entry we limit\nourselves to pragmatic arguments concerning Theism \u2013 whether pro or\ncon \u2013 and skip over pragmatic arguments for non-theistic religions. A\ntheistic pragmatic argument contends that there are practical,\nprudential, or moral reasons for inculcating theistic belief. An\natheistic pragmatic argument holds that there are practical,\nprudential, or moral reasons for denying Theism.\n",
