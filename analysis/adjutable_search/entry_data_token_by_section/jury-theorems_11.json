The political upshot is that the\nepistemic superiority of democracy is at stake\u2014is it\nepistemically better for a society to be run by a few competent\ncitizens? The wisdom-of-crowds conclusion indeed breaks down in all\nthree theorems if one removes homogeneity from the competence premise.\nLarger bodies can then perform worse, because new members may be\n(much) less competent than existing members. Majority reliability can\neven become a decreasing function of group size, and can\nconverge to a level as low as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) if competence of new\nmembers converges fast enough to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFinite optimal group rather than wise crowds? The\nquestion of whether decision bodies should be augmented when new\nmembers are less competent is not far-fetched, but a notorious issue\nin real-life committee design. This is the trade-off: adding less\ncompetent members, on the one hand, lowers average member competence,\nbut, on the other hand, brings the advantage of size, namely that\nerrors of individual members are more easily overruled (\u201cwashed\nout\u201d) by the majority. Depending on which effect is stronger,\nthe probability of majority correctness increases or falls by adding\nless competent members.\n\nWhether some (finite) group is optimal or instead \u201cbigger is\nbetter\u201d has been treated analytically. Answers depend on model\nassumptions (see Karotkin & Paroush 2003).\n\nHow could the wisdom of crowds be rehabilitated? Both wisdom-of-crowds\nhypotheses are discussed in turn.\n\nAsymptotic infallibility despite heterogenous\ncompetence. The asymptotic conclusion of Condorcet\u2019s\nJury Theorem remains true if UC is weakened to the existence of a\nfixed lower bound \\(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon\\) for everyone\u2019s\ncompetence (Paroush 1998). This assumption can be relaxed further: it\nsuffices that the infinitely many individuals are competent on\naverage, which allows for many incompetent\n individuals[12]\n (see Dietrich 2008; for related or more general results: Boland 1989;\nOwen, Grofman, & Feld 1989; Berend & Paroush 1998).\nUnfortunately, these variants of Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem (and\nanalogous variants of the Conditional Jury Theorem) retain only the\ninfallibility conclusion, sacrificing increasing reliability. The more\nproblematic conclusion has been retained, one might complain.\n\nIncreasing reliability despite heterogenous\ncompetence. There are broadly two approaches to rehabilitate\nthe increasing-reliability hypothesis and thereby defend large-scale\ndemocracy in the face of differential competence.\n\nThe first approach effectively denies that larger bodies have\n\u201cworse\u201d members, by postulating a different procedure to\ndetermine group members: members are selected anonymously, rather than\n(for instance) by competence. Increasing group size no longer means\nkeeping the \u201cold\u201d members and adding \u201cnew\u201d,\noften less competent, members, but it means drawing a fully new\n(larger) group from the\n population.[13]\n This procedure for selecting members differs significantly from that\nwhere the members must be the first \\(n\\) individuals in a predefined\n\u201cpriority order\u201d of the individuals. The new procedure is\nanonymous, instead of effectively prioritising individual 1 over\nindividual 2, individual 2 over individual 3, etc. Which procedure is\nmore realistic is debatable and context-dependent.\n\nA second approach assumes\u2014quite realistically\u2014that\nindividual competence levels are unknown. Even if additional group\nmembers were objectively less competent, this fact would be\ninsufficiently known or established (cf. Romeijn & Atkinson 2011).\nThe institutional designer can consider three kinds of justification\nfor a large, inclusive group. An epistemic justification points out\nthat any proxy used for competence might be misleading. For instance,\nit would seem unjustified to exclude citizens without university\neducation because they might be just as competent or more competent;\nexcluding them might lower collective competence. One procedural\njustification holds that it is unfair to exclude individuals from\ndemocratic decision-making even if their incompetence were established\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Such procedural reasons for inclusion could,\nfor example, be based on the democratic right to equal opportunity for\ninfluence. Another, more nuanced procedural view does not generally\noppose voter exclusion, but requires the incompetence to be\nestablished to a high standard, as those excluded are owed reasons for\nbeing ruled by others.\n\nA version of the last view is defended by Estlund (2008). He grants\nthat some individuals can be more competent than others, thereby\nopening the door to arguments for \u201cepistocracy\u201d (decision\nby small bodies of competent citizens) rather than democracy (decision\nby all or most citizens, directly or indirectly). However, Estlund\nrejects epistocracy on grounds that competence levels cannot be\nidentified beyond reasonable doubt. Individuals excluded from\ndecision-making could rightfully object to being ruled by others\n(Estlund 2008: ch. 11). Estlund\u2019s proposal has led to a lively\ndebate on arguments for and against epistocracy and the role of\nuncertainty about competence (Lippert-Rasmussen 2012; Brennan 2018;\nGoodin & Spiekermann 2018: ch. 15; Gunn 2019).\n\nTo formally tackle limited knowledge about individuals, one could, for\ninstance, introduce subjective probabilities over competence levels,\ni.e., over objective correctness probabilities. More simply, one can\neliminate objective probabilities and competence altogether from the\nmodel and work solely with subjective probabilities over individual\njudgments (rather than over individual competence levels). If\nindividuals are subjectively indistinguishable, judgments can be\nassumed to be interchangeable in de Finetti\u2019s sense of\npermutation-invariance. This implies (with an additional assumption)\nthat larger bodies are more reliable, without becoming asymptotically\ninfallible, by a jury theorem for interchangeable voters\n(Dietrich & Spiekermann 2013a; generalising Ladha 1993). Here,\n\u201creliable\u201d and \u201cinfallible\u201d are no longer\nobjective features of the group, but features of knowledge about\nit.\n\nThis subjectivist approach begs the question of who should hold these\ncredences. But at least it takes the problem of uncertainty about\nindividuals seriously.\n",
