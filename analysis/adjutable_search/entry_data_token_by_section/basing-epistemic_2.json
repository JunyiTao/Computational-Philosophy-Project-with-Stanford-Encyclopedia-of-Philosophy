    "main_text": "Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n3. Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nDoxastic theories of the basing relation hold that having an\nappropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason is a good reason\nto hold a belief is sufficient for the belief\u2019s being based on\nthe reason. Such a theory appears to be a natural fit for certain\nkinds of epistemic internalism. For such an account, see Leite (2008).\nSome theories of the basing relation, such as those of Helen Longino\nand Robert Audi, state that such a meta-belief is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for a belief\u2019s being based on a reason\n(Longino 1978; Audi 1986). Such theories hold that if a belief is to\nbe based on a reason, the reason must non-deviantly cause the belief,\nand an appropriate meta-belief must be present. Such theories tend to\nbe vulnerable to the objections to causal theories of the basing\nrelation as well as the objections\u2014to be discussed\nshortly\u2014to doxastic theories of the basing relation.\n\nHere, we will examine Joseph Tolliver\u2019s account of the basing\nrelation. Roughly, Tolliver\u2019s view is that a belief is based on\na reason for a person S if and only if S believes\nthat the reason provides evidence for the belief, and also believes\nthat it is likely that the probability that the belief is true\nincreased at the time the reason was accepted. Tolliver\u2019s aim is\nto avoid the pendulum objection to Swain\u2019s theory while\naffirming Swain and Lehrer\u2019s intuition in the case of the\nsuperstitious lawyer that the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is\ninnocent is based on the complicated line of reasoning.\nTolliver\u2019s account is as follows (Tolliver 1982, p.\n 159):[8]\n\n(B) S bases his or her belief that b on reason\nr at a time t if and only if\n\n\n\n(1) S believes that b at t and S\nbelieves that r at t, and\n\n(2) S believes that the truth of r is evidence for\nthe truth of b at t, and\n\n(3) Where S\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of b\nequals h at t (h being greater than 0 and\nless than or equal to 1), if it were the case that S came to\nbelieve r for the first time at t, then\nS\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of the proposition\n\u201cthe likelihood of b is greater than or equal to\nh\u201d would be greater at t then it was prior to\nt.\n\n\n\nCondition (3) is intended to handle the pendulum case discussed above.\nIn the pendulum case, the student measures the length of a pendulum\nand thereby comes to believe that it has length L. On the\nbasis of this measurement and other truths she knows about pendulums,\nthe student is able to calculate the period of the pendulum. Thus, the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the length serves as a reason for her\nbelief about the period. The apparent problem for Swain\u2019s view\nwas that the students belief about the period also seemed to be\ncounted as a reason on which her belief about the length was based,\nwhen in fact the basing relation went in the reverse direction.\nTolliver\u2019s theory attempts to handle this problem by means of\ncondition (3), which is intended to specify the direction of the\nevidential support relation. Once the student measures the length and\nmakes the inference about the period, the student\u2019s estimate of\nthe likelihood that the pendulum has period P would increase.\nHowever, the student\u2019s belief about the period of the pendulum\nwould not, according to Tolliver, increase the estimate of the\nlikelihood that the pendulum has length L because the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the length is needed to calculate the\nperiod.\n\nOne common line of objection to doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation has to do with individuals who do not possess the epistemic\nconcepts needed to form the meta-belief (that a reason is a good\nreason to hold a belief) required by doxastic theories, but who\nnonetheless seem to base beliefs on reasons. For example, young or\nuneducated persons may seem perfectly capable having reasons for\nbeliefs even if they lack the appropriate concepts of epistemic\nevidence required by condition (2) of Tolliver\u2019s theory. One\npossible line of reply to this sort of objection would be to stipulate\nthat one may have either an appropriate meta-belief or some\nappropriate form of awareness that need not involve any particular\nfully developed epistemic concept. For example, one might allow, as\ndoes Moser\u2019s theory discussed in the foregoing, that one merely\nhave a de re awareness of the evidential relation holding\nbetween the reason and the belief.\n\nAnother common line of objection to doxastic theories concerns the\npossibility of meta-beliefs (to the effect that a reason is a good\nreason to hold a belief) which do not establish basing relations. For\nexample, suppose Ezekiel belongs to a religious cult and slavishly\nbelieves whatever the cult leader, Exidor, tells him. One day Exidor\ntells Ezekiel that his belief in God is a good reason to believe\neverything else Ezekiel believes, and Ezekiel slavishly comes to\nbelieve this. Nonetheless, it would seem highly counter-intuitive to\naccept that, now, everything else Ezekiel believes is in fact based on\nhis belief in God. Perhaps one way to avoid this sort of objection is\nto add additional conditions as to which meta-beliefs are capable of\nestablishing basing relations. One such solution is discussed below,\nin the section regarding causal-doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation.\n\nA third common line of objection to doxastic theories is that we may\nsometimes base beliefs on reasons of which we are unaware. For\nexample, perhaps beliefs can be based on subconscious reasons. If\nso,then beliefs may be based on reasons even though an appropriate\nmeta-belief (that the reason is a good reason to hold the belief)\ncannot be formed because the person remains unaware of the reason.\n",
