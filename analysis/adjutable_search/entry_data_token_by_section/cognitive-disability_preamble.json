    "main_text": "\n\nWhy are cognitive disability and moral status thought to be\nsufficiently connected to warrant a separate entry? The reason is that\nindividuals with cognitive disabilities have served as test cases in\ndebates about the moral relevance of possessing such intellectual\nattributes as self-consciousness and practical rationality. If a\nsignificant portion of human beings lacks self-consciousness and\npractical rationality, then those attributes cannot by themselves\ndistinguish the way we treat cognitively developed human beings from\nthe way we treat non-human animals and human fetuses. If we cannot\nexperiment on or kill human beings who lack those attributes, then the\nlack of those attributes alone cannot be what justifies animal\nexperimentation or abortion.\n\nFor the most part, the philosophers who have considered these claims\nwere not primarily concerned with the treatment or moral status of\ncognitively disabled human beings\u2014they sought to challenge\nexisting practices toward fetuses or animals, or the rationales for\nsuch practices. But those claims have significant practical\nimplications for cognitively disabled human beings. If the\njustification for treating living beings in certain ways does\nrest to some extent on their possession or lack of intellectual\nattributes, then it may be acceptable to treat cognitively disabled\nhuman beings in ways that it would be unacceptable to treat\ncognitively nondisabled humans. This implication, a kind of\nphilosophical blowback from the debates on animal rights and abortion,\nhas become the subject of sustained controversy in applied ethics.\n\nPhilosophers who question the moral status of human beings with the\nmost significant cognitive disabilities often compare them to animals\nclaimed to have similar or greater cognitive abilities (McMahan 1996,\n2002, 2009; Singer 1993, 2009; and Wilkinson 2008 in Other Internet\nResources). Some critics find these comparisons unnecessary and\noffensive (e.g., Carlson 2009; Carlson and Kittay 2009). The\nphilosophers who make such comparisons emphasize contrasts like the\nfollowing: Vast numbers of chimpanzees and other \u201chigher\u201d\nprimates are used in painful and often lethal research for the benefit\nof human beings. Although there are strong objections to specific\nprimate research programs and research on specific primates, there is\nbroad agreement that most primate research is acceptable if it has the\npotential to contribute significantly to human health, and if the\nharms and risks to the animal subjects are minimized. In contrast,\ncognitively disabled human beings cannot be enrolled in potentially\nharmful research unless they are likely to benefit, the risk of harm\nis negligible, and their legal representatives consent to their\nparticipation. They enjoy these protections even if they are no better\nable than non-human primates to understand the aims of the research or\nto consent to\n participation.[1]\n\nThe debate over the moral status of individuals with the most severe\ncognitive disabilities also raises difficult methodological issues\nconcerning the reliance on intuitions, convictions, and considered\njudgments in assessing moral arguments. Some philosophers would deny\nthat any argument should persuade us to abandon our conviction that it\nwould be terribly wrong to subject a human being cognitively incapable\nof consent to painful and dangerous experimentation of no possible\nbenefit to him (e.g., Kittay 2008). Two philosophers have adapted G.E.\nMoore\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d of the existence of the external world (see\nEntry on\n George Edward Moore)\n to claim that we are more confident of the truth of the proposition\nthat all human beings are morally equal, and morally superior to other\nanimals than of the validity of the arguments denying it (Curtis and\nVehmas, 2016a, 2016b). Other philosophers reject the application of\nMoore\u2019s argument to moral status (Lachlan, 2016; Roberts\nforthcoming); more broadly, they insist that even firm convictions\nabout moral status cannot be immune from critical scrutiny, especially\nif they appear to conflict with other deeply held convictions (McMahan\n2007). Still others deny such convictions any presumptive weight or\nauthority (Singer 2005).\n\nFinally, in addressing the moral status of cognitively disabled humans\nin a separate entry, rather than in a general entry on disability, we\nare not endorsing a controversial \u201cexceptionalism\u201d about\ncognitive disabilities\u2014a view that regards them as fundamentally\ndifferent from other kinds of impairment (see\n Related Entries below).\n Our reason for limiting ourselves to cognitive impairment is\ndialectical: there is currently no debate about the moral status of\nindividuals with non-cognitive disabilities. We know of no serious\nphilosopher who argues that people who cannot see, hear, or use their\nlegs, or who experience frequent depression or hallucinations, have\nlower moral status than people without such disabilities. Admittedly,\nsome philosophers claiming to regard humans with physical or\npsychiatric disabilities as having the same moral status as\nnondisabled humans also take positions that other philosophers see as\ninconsistent with a commitment to equal moral status. One notable\nexample is Rawls\u2019 (1971) exclusion of people with physical\ndisabilities from the Original Position on the assumption that they\nare not fully cooperating members of society. Another example is the\ndefense of \u201cquality adjustment\u201d in allocating scarce\nhealthcare resources, which discounts the life-years of people with\ndisabilities to reflect their supposedly lower quality of life\n(Williams 1987). But whether or not these positions are consistent\nwith the recognition of full moral status, their proponents insist\nthat they are; they do not attempt to argue against the equal moral\nstatus of people with physical or (most) psychiatric disabilities. By\ncontrast, the moral status of human beings with cognitive disabilities\nhas become a subject of intense debate among philosophers, applied\nethicists, and disability scholars (for a recent discussion, see\nCarlson and Kittay 2009).\n\nWe will proceed as follows. We will first characterize the human\nbeings who are the subject of the debate on moral status\u2014those\nwith what we will call \u201cradical cognitive disabilities.\u201d\nAfter discussing the ways in which humans are classified as\ncognitively disabled, we will describe the narrower category of humans\nwhom the debate concerns. To be clear, this is a group of humans\nstipulated to exist rather than classified by empirical procedures. We\nwill note the difficulty of separating claims about such stipulated\nindividuals from claims that some actual individuals satisfy that\nstipulation. Next, we will characterize the concept of moral status,\ndescribing its structure and function. We will then outline the\nprincipal differences in how that concept is understood, particularly\nits \u201cinclusion criteria\u201d\u2014the criteria for ascribing\nwhat we will call \u201cfull moral status,\u201d the status\nattributed to cognitively nondisabled adult human beings. (In calling\nthat moral status \u201cfull,\u201d we do not intend to take sides\nin the debates over whether there can be any higher moral status.) We\nwill identify one family of moral-status accounts\u2014those basing\npossession on individual attributes\u2014as the primary, though not\nthe exclusive, source of the challenge addressed in this entry: the\nclaim that some human beings lack full moral status. After outlining\nthose accounts, we will review several ways of meeting the challenge:\n1) basing full moral status on individual attributes shared by a\ngreater proportion of human beings; 2) adopting secondary grounds for\nthe possession of full moral status\u2014by \u201ccourtesy\u201d or\nby \u201cproxy\u201d; 3) rejecting individual attribute accounts in\nfavor of accounts that base the full moral status of all human beings\non their species membership or their humanity. \n",
