    "main_text": "Rationality and Emotions || Cognitive Rationality as Fittingness, Warrant and Coherence\n10.1 Cognitive Rationality as Fittingness, Warrant and Coherence\n\nWe distinguish between the cognitive rationality of emotions,\nconsisting of their ability to represent the world as it is and\nproperly relate to other evidence-sensitive evaluative processes, and\nthe strategic rationality of emotions, consisting of their\nability to lead to actions that promote the agent\u2019s interests\nand properly relate to other action-influencing processes (De Sousa\n1987, 2011; see also Greenspan 2000; Mulligan 1998; Solomon 1980; Thagard\n2006; Stephan 2017b). \n\nEmotions have long been thought to score poorly in terms of both\ncognitive and strategic rationality. The Stoics famously argued that\nemotions are false judgments. For example, fearing a tiger would\ninvolve the false judgment that one\u2019s endangered life is\nimportant, whereas the sage should be indifferent to everything except\nvirtue. Failures of the emotions at the strategic level are also\ndeeply ingrained in both theoretical approaches and common sense.\nIra brevis furor, said the Romans: anger is a brief bout of\nmadness. In recent times, the pendulum has swung back, and researchers\nin both philosophy and affective science have started rehabilitating\nthe emotions in terms of both cognitive and strategic rationality. A\nproper appreciation of the role of emotions with respect to\nrationality requires a number of distinctions.\n\nOur first distinctions pertain to three varieties of cognitive\nrationality for emotions: rationality as fittingness,\nrationality as warrant and rationality as coherence.\nThe dominant view on emotions is that they are representations of core\nrelational themes or formal objects. Therefore, a first dimension of\nassessment for rationality concerns whether or not such core\nrelational themes/formal objects are instantiated. We may for instance\nsay that fear is rational in terms of fittingness just in\ncase it is directed towards things that are truly dangerous, because\nthis is what fear represents. Being afraid of a shark swimming\nalongside you is fitting, because the shark is dangerous. As\nD\u2019Arms and Jacobson (2000) have emphasized, fittingness is importantly different\nfrom forms of appropriateness that are moral or strategic. For\nexample, amusement at a funny joke may be fitting even if being amused\nby it is both morally inappropriate due to the sexist content of the\njoke, and costly in terms of self-interest, because those who witness\nthe amusement may form a bad opinion of the amused agent.\n\nSuppose now that fear is elicited by something that is not dangerous.\nFear could still manifest rationality as warrant if its\nparticular object manifests relevant evidential cues of dangerousness.\nFor example, being afraid of a realistic replica of a shark moving\nalongside you in the water would be rational in the warrant sense, even though,\nunbeknownst to you, the shark replica is being remote-controlled by\na group of innocuous marine biologists.\n\nA third dimension of cognitive rationality concerns the\nconsistency of emotions with other representations of what\nthe world is like. If someone experiences fear of flying and believes\nthat flying is dangerous, there is rationality as coherence between\nwhat they fear and what they believe (even though fear is unfitting\ngiven the extremely low likelihood of plane accidents).\n\nAs noted in\n section 7.1,\n emotions are often recalcitrant to reason: many people do\nnot believe that flying is dangerous, and yet continue to\nfear it. But emotions manifest rationality as coherence in a great\nmany cases. This is due in part to the fact that emotions have\ncognitive bases, which consist of cognitions whose function\nis to provide emotions with their particular objects\u2014I must\nbelieve, perceive or imagine being on an airplane prior to fearing\nit.\n\nWhen such cognitions are beliefs, their modification tends to be\ncoherently reflected in changes of the emotions. For example, if I am\nangry at Tom based on my belief that he has bad mouthed me with a\ncolleague, my anger is unlikely to survive the realization that he has\nnot, in fact, bad mouthed me with a colleague. On occasion, however,\nmy anger toward Tom will persist despite my belief that no slight\nwhatsoever has taken place, thereby revealing irrationality as\nincoherence.\n\nA special case of rationality as coherence regards the coherence of\nsets of emotions. Helm (2009) has argued that emotions come in\nrational patterns centered around the things that have import for the\nagent. For instance, if avoiding death is a concern of mine, then I\nshould not only feel fear when my life is threatened by a deadly disease, but I should\nalso feel, on pain of irrationality, relief once the threat\ndissipates and sadness or disappointment if the disease progresses instead.\n",
