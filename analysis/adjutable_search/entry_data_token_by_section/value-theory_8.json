    "main_text": "Relation to the Deontic || Teleology\n3.1 Teleology\n\nTeleological theories are not, strictly speaking, theories about\nvalue. They are theories about right action, or about what one ought\nto do. But they are committed to claims about value, because\nthey appeal to evaluative facts, in order to explain what is right and\nwrong, and what we ought to do \u2014 deontic facts. The most\nobvious consequence of these theories, is therefore that evaluative\nfacts must not then be explained in terms of deontic facts. The\nevaluative, on such views, is prior to the deontic.\n3.1.1 Classical Consequentialism\n\nThe most familiar sort of view falling under this umbrella is\nclassical consequentialism, sometimes called (for reasons\nwe\u2019ll see in section 3.3) \u201cagent-neutral\nconsequentialism\u201d. According to classical consequentialism,\nevery agent ought always to do whatever action, out of all of the\nactions available to her at that time, is the one such that if she did\nit, things would be best. Not all defenders of consequentialism\ninterpret it in such classical terms; other prominent forms of\nconsequentialism focus on rules or motives, and evaluate actions only\nderivatively.\n\nClassical consequentialism is sometimes supported by appeal to the\nintuition that one should always do the best action, and then the\nassumption that actions are only instrumentally good or bad \u2014\nfor the sake of what they lead to (compare especially Moore [1903]).\nThe problem with this reasoning is that non-consequentialists can\nagree that agents ought always to do the best action. The important\nfeature of this claim to recognize is that it is a claim not about\nintrinsic or instrumental value, but about attributive good. And as\nnoted in section 2.1, \u201cinstrumental\u201d and\n\u201cintrinsic\u201d don\u2019t really apply to attributive good.\nJust as how good of a can opener something is or how good of a\ntorturer someone is does not depend on how good the world is, as a\nresult of the fact that they exist, how good of an action something is\nneed not depend on how good the world is, as a result that it happens.\nIndeed, if it did, then the evaluative standards governing actions\nwould be quite different from those governing nearly everything\nelse.\n3.1.2 Problems in Principle vs. Problems of Implementation\n\nClassical consequentialism, and its instantiation in the form of\nutilitarianism, has been well-explored, and its advantages and costs\ncannot be surveyed here. Many of the issues for classical\nconsequentialism, however, are issues for details of its exact\nformulation or implementation, and not problems in principle\nwith its appeal to the evaluative in order to explain the deontic. For\nexample, the worry that consequentialism is too demanding has been\naddressed within the consequentialist framework, by replacing\n\u201cbest\u201d with \u201cgood enough\u201d \u2014 substituting\na \u201csatisficing\u201d conception for a \u201cmaximizing\u201d\none (Slote [1989]). For another example, problems faced by certain\nconsequentialist theories, like traditional utilitarianism, about\naccounting for things like justice can be solved by other\nconsequentialist theories, simply by adopting a more generous picture\nabout what sort of things contribute to how good things are (Sen\n[1982]).\n\nIn section 3.3 we\u2019ll address one of the most central issues\nabout classical consequentialism: its inability to allow for\nagent-centered constraints. This issue does pose an\nin-principle general problem for the aspiration of consequentialism to\nexplain deontic categories in terms of the evaluative. For more, see\nthe entry on\n consequentialism and utilitarianism.\n3.1.3 Other Teleological Theories\n\nUniversalizable egoism is another familiar teleological theory.\nAccording to universalizable egoism, each agent ought always to do\nwhatever action has the feature that, of all available alternatives,\nit is the one such that, were she to do it, things would be best\nfor her. Rather than asking agents to maximize the good, egoism\nasks agents to maximize what is good for them. Universalizable\negoism shares many features with classical consequentialism, and\nSidgwick found both deeply attractive. Many others have joined\nSidgwick in holding that there is something deeply attractive about\nwhat consequentialism and egoism have in common \u2014 which\ninvolves, at minimum, the teleological idea that the deontic is to be\nexplained in terms of the evaluative (Portmore [2005]).\n\nOf course, not all teleological theories share the broad features of\nconsequentialism and egoism. Classical Natural Law theories (Finnis\n[1980], Murphy [2001]) are teleological, in the sense that they seek\nto explain what we ought to do in terms of what is good, but they do\nso in a very different way from consequentialism and egoism. According\nto an example of such a Natural Law theory, there are a variety of\nnatural values, each of which calls for a certain kind of distinctive\nresponse or respect, and agents ought always to act in ways that\nrespond to the values with that kind of respect. For more on natural\nlaw theories, see the entry on\n the natural law tradition in ethics.\u00a0\n And Barbara Hermann has prominently argued for interpreting\nKant\u2019s ethical theory in teleological terms.\u00a0 For more on\nHerman\u2019s interpretation of Kant, see the entry on\n Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy,\n especially section 13.\u00a0Philip Pettit [1997] prominently\ndistinguishes between values that we are called to\n\u201cpromote\u201d and those which call for other responses.\u00a0\nAs Pettit notes, classical consequentialists hold that all values are\nto be promoted, and one way of thinking of some of these other kinds\nof teleological theories is that like consequentialism they explain\nwhat we ought to do in terms of what is good, but unlike\nconsequentialism they hold that some kinds of good call for responses\nother than promotion.\n",
