    "main_text": "Knowledge\n5. Knowledge\n\nMany virtue epistemologists agree that, in very general terms,\nknowledge is non-accidentally true belief. Different theories spell\nout \u201cnon-accidentally\u201d differently, but among many\npractitioners a common understanding of that key term seems to have\nemerged. Simply put, to know is to believe the truth because of your\nintellectual virtue (e.g., Sosa 1991: 277; Zagzebski 1996:\n271\u20132, Riggs 2002: 93\u20134; Lehrer 2000: 223; Greco 2003:\n111; Turri 2011). In recent years, some practitioners influenced by\nthe knowledge-first approach have suggested reversing the direction of\nanalysis by starting with competences to know and then understanding\nbelief as potentially-defective knowledge (Miracchi 2015, Kelp 2017).\nEither way, practitioners hold that there is a tight connection\nbetween knowledge, on the one hand, and the exercise of intellectual\nvirtue or competence, on the other hand.\n\nOne benefit claimed for this basic approach is that it provides an\nintuitive account of why knowledge is inconsistent with luck of a\ncertain sort. For instance, some begin with the intuitive thought that\nyou don\u2019t know something if it is \u201clargely a matter of\nluck\u201d that you believe it (Riggs 2007). But why does knowledge\npreclude luck in this way? In the first detailed attempt to answer\nthis question, Wayne Riggs says that the opposition between knowledge\nand luck is best explained by the hypothesis that knowledge is\n\u201can achievement for which the knower deserves credit\u201d\n(Riggs 2009: 341). And knowers deserve credit because they believe the\ntruth because of their virtue (Greco 2003). In response, some have\nargued that luck and virtue are orthogonal dimensions of epistemic\nevaluation (Pritchard 2012), and that knowledge must be due to virtue\nmore than luck, as opposed to virtue rather than\nluck (Carter 2014).\n\nA related benefit of the basic approach is that, in the eyes of many\npractitioners, it solves the Gettier problem. Gettier cases follow a\nrecipe. Start with a belief sufficiently justified to meet the\njustification condition for knowledge. Then add an element of bad luck\nthat would normally prevent the justified belief from being true.\nLastly add a dose of good luck that \u201ccancels out the bad\u201d,\nso the belief ends up true anyhow. It has proven difficult to explain\nwhy this \u201cdouble luck\u201d prevents knowledge (Zagzebski\n1996).\n\nHere is a Gettier case (adapted from Zagzebski 1996: 285\u20136).\nMary enters the house and looks into the living room. A familiar\nappearance greets her from her husband\u2019s chair. She thinks,\n\u201cMy husband is sitting in the living room\u201d, and then walks\ninto the den. But Mary misidentified the man in the chair. It is not\nher husband, but his brother, whom she had no reason to believe was\neven in the country. However, her husband was seated along the\nopposite wall of the living room, out of Mary\u2019s sight, dozing in\na different chair.\n\nThe VE solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge requires you\nto believe the truth \u201cbecause of\u201d your intellectual\nvirtues, but Gettier subjects do not believe the truth because of\ntheir virtues, so they do not know (Zagzebski 1996: 285 ff; Greco\n2003; Sosa 2007: ch. 5; Turri 2011). Some critics complain that this\nview is uninformative because we lack an adequate understanding of\nwhat it is to believe \u201cbecause of\u201d or \u201cout of\u201d\nvirtue (e.g., Roberts & Wood 2007). Other critics argue that the\nbasic approach still suffers from counterexamples (e.g., Baehr 2006a;\nChurch 2013).\n\nRecently, leading practitioners have touted the fact that VE places\nknowledge in a familiar pattern. On this approach, epistemic\nevaluation is just another example of the basic way in which we\nevaluate all behavior, performances, and attempts. The most widely\ndiscussed articulation of this view is Ernest Sosa\u2019s\nAAA\u2013model of performance assessment (Sosa 2007: 22\u20133; for\nrelated but subtly different approaches, see Greco 2003 & 2010 and\nMorton 2013). On this approach, we can assess performances for\naccuracy, adroitness, and aptness. Accurate performances achieve their\naim, adroit performances manifest competence, and apt performances are\naccurate because adroit. This AAA-model applies to all conduct and\nperformances with an aim, whether intentional (as in ballet) or\nunintentional (as with a heartbeat). \n\nHere\u2019s how the model applies in epistemology. (A more\ncomplicated model has lately been proposed, which takes into account\nthe agent\u2019s own risk-assessment and decisions about when and how\nto perform; see Sosa 2015.) Belief-formation is a psychological\nperformance with an aim. For beliefs, accuracy is identified with\ntruth, adroitness with manifesting intellectual competence, and\naptness with being \u201ctrue because competent\u201d. Apt belief,\nthen, is belief that is true because competent. A competence, in\nturn,\n\n\nis a disposition, one with a basis resident in the competent agent,\none that would in appropriately normal conditions ensure (or make\nhighly likely) the success of any relevant performance issued by it.\n(Sosa 2007: 29)\n\n\nKnowledge is then identified with apt belief, which is just \u201ca\nspecial case\u201d of \u201ccreditable, apt performance\u201d, a\nstatus common across the gamut of human activities.\n\nConsider the performance of an archer who hits a bullseye because she\nshoots competently. Her shot is apt, and her bullseye an achievement.\nIt\u2019s possible that she might easily have missed. She might have\nluckily avoided being drugged before the competition, which would have\nimpaired her competence. Or a strong gust of wind, which would have\nruined her shot, might have just been avoided by a rare confluence of\nlocal meteorological conditions. In any of these ways, her performance\nmight have been apt even though there are nearby possible worlds in\nwhich she does not hit the bullseye. Sosa (2007: 31) says that\nknowledge is also like this: in some cases you might believe aptly,\nand thus know, even though you might easily have been wrong. More\nrecently, Sosa (2020) has also argued that suspension of judgment can\nbe analyzed in a similar way: when someone sets out on an inquiry as\nto whether p, she might conclude that the evidence is\ninconclusive, leading her to suspend judgment as to\nwhether p. Such suspension is itself a manifestation of\nthe competence to recognize that one is not in a position to know\nwhether p.\n\nSome have argued that Sosa\u2019s AAA-model is open to\ncounterexamples. For example, Duncan Pritchard (2009a), echoing\nJennifer Lackey\u2019s (2007) broader criticism of credit views of\nknowledge, argues that Sosa\u2019s view gives the wrong verdict in\nthe fake-barn thought experiment (originally due to Carl Ginet; see\nGoldman 1976: 772\u20133). In this thought experiment, Henry and his\nson are driving through the country. Henry pulls over to stretch his\nlegs, and while doing so regales his son with a list of currently\nvisible roadside items. \u201cThat\u2019s a tractor. That\u2019s a\ncombine. That\u2019s a horse. That\u2019s a silo. And that\u2019s a\nfine barn\u201d, he adds, pointing to the nearby roadside barn. But\nunbeknownst to them, the locals recently secretly replaced nearly\nevery barn in the country with fake barns (they\u2019re in\n\u201cFake Barn Country\u201d). Henry happens to see the one real\nbarn in the whole county. Had he instead set eyes on any of the\nnumerous nearby fakes, he would have falsely believed it was a barn.\nHenry has a true belief because of his perceptual acuity, Pritchard\nsays, so it counts as apt and Sosa\u2019s view entails that Henry\nknows. But, Pritchard claims, it\u2019s obvious that Henry\ndoesn\u2019t know. Pritchard (2008a: 445) raises an exactly similar\nobjection to Greco\u2019s theory of knowledge.\n\nCriticism on this point has come on two fronts. On the one hand, some\nepistemologists have argued that (contra Pritchard) fake-barn-style\ncases, which feature environmental luck, are not cases of apt belief\nor cognitive achievement (e.g., Jarvis 2013; Littlejohn 2014). On the\nother hand, some reject the claim that the agent doesn\u2019t know in\nthis case or structurally similar ones (e.g., Lycan 2006; Turri 2011).\nMoreover, recent experimental work has shown that non-philosophers\noverwhelmingly view fake-barn cases, and structurally similar ones, as\ninstances of knowledge (Cola\u00e7o, Buckwalter, Stich & Machery\n2014; Turri, Buckwalter, & Blouw 2014; Turri 2016c).\n",
