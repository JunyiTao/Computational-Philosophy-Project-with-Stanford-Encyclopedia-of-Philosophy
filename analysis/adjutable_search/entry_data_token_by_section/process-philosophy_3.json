Tracking science: new topics for process philosophy\n\nThe relationship to science and technology appears to mark a\ndistinctive difference between continental process philosophy\n(Heidegger, Deleuze, Badiou) on the one hand, and, on the other hand,\nearly American process philosophy (Peirce, James, Dewey, Whitehead,\nMead) as well as current analytical process thought. While the former\ndevelops a critical point of view to reflect on the enterprises of\nscience and technology as cultural objects, the latter aligns its\ninvestigations with the aims and results of science and technology,\noften with an explicit commitment to naturalism. In fact, the early\nphase of process philosophy in America was mainly motivated by an\neffort to come to terms with the far-reaching philosophical\nimplications of the Darwinian theory of evolution. For these early\nAmerican process thinkers evolution was an emblematic and paradigmatic\nprocess\u2014it seemed to provide a clear template for understanding\nhow novelty and innovation come into both the human world and the\nworld of nature. The evolutionary framework calls for a new\nmetaphysics, the American pragmatists argued, which could articulate\nthe pervasive role of process and of the passage of time. Was there a\nvehicle or substance that could \u2018carry\u2019 physical,\nbiological, and cosmic evolution? If neither individuals nor types\n(species) of things are time-invariant, a new account of being was\nneeded that had room for the emergence of novelty in nature, and could\nconvey a sense of human existence as both \u201cprecarious and\nstable\u201d (Dewey). The idea that evolution was a fact that\nphilosophy had to accommodate explains many of the elements of early\nAmerican process thought, in particular the understanding of\ndynamicity as a force of creating novelty, as well as the need to take\na stance on the question whether the overall process of reality is\ndirected or blind\u2014which ultimately split the group (see section\n6).\n\nPresent-day contributions to analytical process philosophy are no\nlonger driven by an attempt of making sense of evolution. However,\nthey are often still motivated by the view that there are certain\nresults in science that philosophy simply must come to grips with, and\nif this task involves a fundamental revision of the standard tools of\nphilosophy, then philosophy should provide new conceptual tools. For\nquite some time researchers in the philosophy of biology and in the\nphilosophy of chemistry have argued that process-based or\nprocess-geared approaches yield better ontological descriptions of\nthese domains, i.e., better capture the inferential content of the\nbasic concepts of biology and\n chemistry.[17]\n The case of biology provides particularly strong empirical\nmotivations for a \u2018process turn,\u2019 as witnessed by a recent\ncollection of research in philosophy of biology that deserves special\nattention since most of its contributors do not proceed from but\narrive at process-ontological theses (Nicholson and Dupr\u00e9\n2018). As the editors point out, metabolism, lifecycles, and\ninterdependencies between genetics and ecology\u2014that is,\nprocesses that occur both at the level of cell biology as well as at\nthe level of multicellular organism\u2014present three classes of\nbiological phenomena that in different ways dismantle\nsubstance-ontological presumptions; these phenomena call for an\nontology that treats transtemporal sameness as a time-scale dependent\nfeature of process systems and models organisms no longer as\nindependent and comparatively discrete substances but as a complex\nnetwork of internal and external\n interactions.[18]\n\nBeyond chemistry and biology there are other scientific domains where\nscientific progress suggests process-ontological redescriptions since\nthe conceptual contents of the relevant scientific terms cannot,\nwithout problematic distortions, be analyzed in terms of the\ncategories of substance metaphysics. However, there are also\nscientific domains and topics that directly imply a\nprocess-ontological interpretation since the researchers working in\nthese areas already have adopted processist idioms in their informal\nglosses of mathematical descriptions and in their heuristic approach\nto the domain. Cases in point for a \u2018process turn\u2019 within\nscience itself are (i) quantum physics, (ii) self-organization, and,\nmost recently, (iii) cognition.\n\n(i) Quantum-physical processes: When Whitehead turned from\nmathematics to philosophy, he was quite aware that recent developments\nin physics (the demise of classical atomism in the face of quantum\ntheory and relativity theory) had thrown out our old common-sense\nvision of the order of the universe. Quantum physics brought on the\ndematerialization of physical matter\u2014matter in the small could\nno longer be conceptualized as a Rutherfordian planetary system of\nparticle-like objects. The entities described by the mathematical\nformalism seemed to fit the picture of a collection of fluctuating\nprocesses organized into apparently stable structures by statistical\nregularities\u2014i.e., by regularities of comportment at the level\nof aggregate phenomena. During the early decades of the twentieth\ncentury process philosophers were excited by the evidence that physics\nhad turned the tables on the core refuge of substance metaphysics:\nclassical atomism. Instead of very small things (atoms)\ncombining to produce standard processes (avalanches, snowstorms)\nmodern physics seemed to suggest that very small processes (quantum\nphenomena) combine to produce standard things (ordinary macro-objects)\nas a result of an as yet not understood modus operandi that\ncould, nevertheless, be mathematically described. So-called enduring\n\u201cthings\u201d in this picture would come about through the\nemergence of stabilities in statistical fluctuations, as a stability\nwave in a surging sea of process, metaphorically speaking.\n\nContemporary quantum physics has produced a more diversified theory\nlandscape, and it is an open question whether we have moved beyond the\npoint where Whitehead\u2019s metaphysical transposition of the field\nconcept is still pertinent, or could be adjusted to interpret also one\nof the currently competing\n theories.[19]\n However, very generally speaking, there are at least four basic\naspects of our current views of the quantum-physical domain that seem\nto favor a process metaphysics, whether Whiteheadian or\nnon-Whiteheadian. First, as the so-called \u2018problem of identical\nparticles\u2019 indicates, in the microphysical domain individuation\nand countability fall asunder, which calls for an ontology of\n\u2018subject-less\u2019 processes that are the features by\nwhich we individuate quantum-physical entities, but occur in countable\nunits only relative to interaction context. Second, if spacetime is\nquantized and emergent, metaphysics cannot operate with basic entities\nthat are individuated in terms of their spacetime locations. Third,\nthe \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d presents a particular difficulty\nfor substance metaphysics, since the latter rests on the assumption\nthat all individuals are fully determinate independently of their\ninteraction context. In contrast, process metaphysics endorses the\nprinciple that \u2018interaction is determination.\u2019 Fourth,\nquantum entanglement (e.g., in EPR-Bohm systems) seems a clear-cut\nexample of ontic emergence that substance metaphysics cannot\naccommodate; while some systems properties (e.g., weight) can be\nconstrued as resulting directly from the causal properties of the\nelements of a collection of persistent substrata, the correlations\nthat measurements on entangled quantum entities display cannot be\ninterpreted in this fashion since the properties of the components of\nthe system do not exist independently of the measurement performed.\nThe measured correlations thus are properties of an interaction and\nnot of any substance. While working quantum physicists often are\nhesitant to attempt any conceptual explication of mathematical models\nof quantum physical processes, Carlo Rovelli is a notable exception.\nRovelli\u2019s relationist interpretation of loop quantum gravity is\ncommitted to an understanding of physical being as becoming in a\nradical sense, as a sort of change that does not presuppose a\npre-existing spacetime\n framework.[20]\n\nInterestingly, via the unlikely subject of an ontology of quantum\nphysics, new points of contact have opened up between analytical and\n(\u2018continental\u2019) interpretive process thought in Karen\nBarad\u2019s metaphysics of \u201cagential realism\u201d (Barad\n2007). Grounded in a detailed interpretation of the philosophy of\nNiels Bohr, Barad views reality as the entanglement of natural and\nsocial\u201cagencies\u201d the distinctness of which emerges in the\nspecific \u201cintra-actions\u201d produced by specific physical\nset-ups (experiments); the continuous \u201cintra-activity\u201d of\nreality, Barad argues, calls for a non-essentialist, performatist\nunderstanding of meaning and values.\n\n(ii) Self-organization: Process metaphysics traditionally has\nbeen motivated by the fact that it seems to give the best explanation\nof the phenomena of diachronic emergence, originally understood as an\nintegral feature of evolution. Since the development of scientific\ntheories of \u201cself-organization,\u201d \u201cchaos,\u201d and\n\u201ccomplexity\u201d have begun to alter our understanding of\nevolutionary change, there is a new need for a metaphysics that can\naccommodate all sorts of phenomena where dynamic organizations exert\ncausal constraints. While older, speculative, process metaphysics\nembraced the idea of purposes and creativity in nature, and allowed\nfor the explanatory category of a \u2018self-realizing\u2019 or\n\u2018self-engendering\u2019 entity (in various terminological\nguises), present-day analytical processists confine themselves to\narguing that \u201cdownward causation\u201d becomes perfectly\nintelligible once physicalism has been divorced from the assumptions\nof the substance paradigm, and especially from the principle that\ncausal powers cannot be attributed to dynamic\n organizations.[21]\n\n(iii) Embodied cognition: The turn to \u201cembodied\ncognition\u201d in cognitive science provides another strong\nmotivation for the turn to process in metaphysics. The standard model\nof cognition as the computation of symbolic representations fits well\nwith the assumptions of substance metaphysics and suggested a pleasing\nanalogy to classical atomism: mental operations effect relational\nchange of cognitive atoms. But the first rivals to the standard model,\nconnectionism and the so-called \u201cDynamic Hypothesis\u201d (Van\nGelder 2000), were constructed along largely process-ontological\nlines, replacing the classical conception of cognitions as discrete\nabstract objects that represent concrete things outside the head with\na dynamic conception of cognitions as modes of functionings of a\nneural net or of process organizations. The neural network model of\nthe mind dominates in recent cognitive science and neuroscience where\nmathematical models of \u201cpredictive processing\u201d (see the\nentry on\n connectionism).\n In parallel with the development of the connectionist model of the\nmind, proponents of \u201cinteractivism\u201d and \u201cembodied\ncognition\u201d argued that the bodily interaction of an organism\nplays a constitutive role in cognition. A key notion for the early\ndebate about the\u2018embodiment thesis\u2019 was the concept of\n\u201cstructural coupling,\u201d a phase in the contemporaneous\ndevelopment of two systems (e.g., organism and environment) where\nmutual dynamic dependencies unfold across system boundaries. During\nthe last decade researchers working in the intersection of cognitive\nscience and philosophy of mind appear to have adopted the \u201c4E\nmodel of cognition\u201d, holding that cognition is not only\nembodied, but also \u201cembedded, enacted, and extended\u201d\n(Newen et al 2018). The 4E model of cognition is explicitly committed\nto a process view but much ontological work remains to be done in\norder to distill biologically relevant process architectures from the\nstatistical formulas (e.g., \u201cMarkov blankets\u201d) that\ncharacterize neural network\n behaviors.[22]\n5. Current challenges\n\nProcess philosophers share the view that being is dynamic or that\nthere are no concrete static entities; however, as stressed throughout\nthis entry, there are also profound differences in the way process\nphilosophers work out this basic intuition in their descriptions of\nthe structure of reality and our understanding of it. Which of the\ncompeting approaches to process philosophy can count as the currently\nmost promising? If processist theories recommend themselves in terms\nof their explanatory force, as offering new solutions to old problems\n(section 3), or better conceptual resources for new tasks (section 4),\nthen surely explanatory force should also be the standard for\nevaluating processist theories. But while cross-paradigm explanatory\nadvantages in the sense of sections 3 and 4 can be gauged more\nstraightforwardly, this becomes rather more difficult at the level of\nintra-paradigm comparisons. Does the wide scope of Whitehead\u2019s\nphilosophy of organism outweigh the fact that all explanatory\ntechnical terms are dissociated from the rest of philosophical\ndiscourse? Or again, is the explanatory force of a formal axiomatic\nprocess ontology greater than a process metaphysics formulated with\nthe means of common sense terms whose meanings are carefully\ngerrymandered, or one that operates with a network of metaphors and\nrelies on the reader\u2019s hermeneutic response? Should depth and\ndetail of the ontological description matter less perhaps than the\nimpressive explanatory scope of a consistently naturalist process view\nof \u201cThe Whole Person\u201d, from microphysics to macrosociology\n(Bickhard 2022)? Here, at the intra-paradigm level, arise all the\nfar-reaching methodological questions that surround philosophical\nexplanation in general. Setting these larger questions aside, and\nfocusing just on processist work in the style of analytic philosophy,\nthe explanatory force of a processist theory may depend on how well it\naddresses the following challenges.\n\nThe first challenge is to define the notion of dynamicity itself. If\nthe individuals of a processist theory are \u2018dynamic\u2019\nrather than \u2018static,\u2019 how can we make sense of this new\ncategory feature? Some processists say that a process or dynamic\nentity is denoted by an English sentence in the progressive,\nor\u2014less closely tied to the peculiarities of English\ngrammar\u2014by sentences licensing certain inferential patterns of\naspectual meaning (see\n footnote 6).\n In both cases the definitional task is thus deferred to linguistic\ntheories of aspect; these theories, however, take the term\n\u2018dynamic\u2019 to be understood. Alternatively, one might\nreturn to Aristotle and define dynamicity as the actualization of a\npotency or capacity. Such metaphysical expenditure can be justified if\nwe need to embrace a notion of the \u2018real\u2019 as characterized\nby actuality and potentiality anyway in order to arrive at a plausible\ninterpretation of quantum physics (as argued in Eastman et al 2016 and\nEastman 2020). A third, naturalist, strategy for defining different\ntypes of dynamicity has been suggested by Terrence Deacon, who\nintroduces an ontological label (\u201chomeodynamics\u201d) for the\nprocessing that realizes the tendency of energy dissipation\ncharacterized by the second law of thermodynamics, and describes the\nemergence of two other forms of dynamicity\n(\u201cmorphodynamics\u201d and \u201cteleodynamics\u201d) in\nterms of relationships of processes constraining each others\u2019\ntendencies for thermodynamic dissipation (Deacon 2012). Since some of\nthose processual constraints are self-referential in the sense that\nthey prevent (constrain) the thermodynamic dissipation of\nprocessing-under-such-constraints\u2014a process architecture that\nMark Bickhard labeled \u201crecursive self-maintenance\u201d\n(2004)\u2014Deacon\u2019s approach to an understanding of dynamicity\nnot only picks up on metaphysical insights of articulated in Buddhism\nand Daoism (Deacon and Cashman 2016), but also resonates with the\nfourth strategy of defining dynamicity, championed in German Idealism.\nNotwithstanding profound differences in systematic embedding, Fichte,\nHegel, and Schelling exploit the semantics of self-referential\npropositions to convey a dynamic understanding of being that is\n\u2018presence without availability\u2019, i.e., a\n\u2018presence\u2019 that can be grasped by, and as such has the\ncharacter of, a non-terminating recursion. A fifth strategy for\naddressing the task of defining dynamicity would be to reject the task\nand to directly challenge the idea of being as static. For example,\none might argue that we may be able to think coherently that\ngeometrical shapes have a sort of being that is static or unchanging,\nbut physical entities this is not possible, since it would imply that\nphysical properties can be literally possessed at an instant\nof time.\n\nThe second challenge is to state precisely how processes relate to\nspace and time. Does a commitment to a process metaphysics imply a\ncertain metaphysics of time? Do processes in some fashion constitute\nspace and time, as Whitehead postulated? Or are they occupiers of\nspatiotemporal regions like perduring entities, just not static (and\nthus, for example, providing better support for presentist accounts of\ntime than classical substances)? Upon a closer look, the distinction\nbetween \u201cperdurance\u201d and \u201cendurance\u201d (Mark\nJohnston, David Lewis), which is commonly (though perhaps not quite\ncorrectly) linked to W.E. Johnson\u2019s distinction between\noccurrents and continuants, sits badly with a process ontology. For\n\u2018activity-like\u2019 processes (e.g., snowing) somehow seem to\ntake time just as perduring entities do, yet are \u201cwholly\npresent\u201d at every time at which they exist, just like enduring\nentities or continuants. Several authors thus have pointed out that\nprocesses behave like\n continuants.[23]\n As mentioned above in section 3, this opens up a new solution path\nfor the problem of persistence, but it also calls for a clear account\nof how ongoing developmental and activity-like processes are situated\nin time and space, and how they relate to extended temporal and\nspatial regions. Moreover, if processes relate to space and time in\nways that does not allow for individuation in terms of spatiotemporal\nlocation, how else do we individuate processes? Should we take our\nbearings from scientific practices of individuating particular\nprocesses (Pemberton 2018) or can we, at least for some types of\nprocesses, lay down general conditions to determine which processes\nare parts of particular process individuals (Kaiser 2018)? For those\nwho take processes to be (abstract or concrete)\n\u201ctype-like\u201d non-particulars the question of individuation\ncan be addressed in the same way in which we individuate types,\nnamely, by classificatory taxonomies that, among other criteria,\nrelate to the way in which processes occur in space and/or time.\n [24]\n\nThe third challenge consists in describing the different ways in which\nprocesses relate to each other and especially, how they combine. Since\nprocess combinations may engender emergent processes, and also in\nother regards do not abide by the laws of Boolean algebra, neither set\ntheory not classical extensional mereology can be used as formal\nframeworks ontologically to describe and classify different types of\nprocess combinations. Moreover, since the parthood relation on\nprocesses is not transitive, at least when processes are not\nidentified with extended spatiotemporal regions, further deviations\nfrom the classical axiomatization of the parthood relations are\nnecessary to formalize a mereology on\n processes.[25]\n Alternatively, some authors suggest representing process\narchitectures with the means of mathematical category theory. Since\nsome category-theoretically defined notions of compositionality\nrestrict decomposition, proponents of \u201capplied category\ntheory\u201d argue that interdependencies of (the identity of) wholes\nand parts in process structures also can be represented within this\nformalism without incurring substance-ontological commitments. Some\nauthors recommend category theory for a formal Whiteheadian approach\nto process metaphysics (Ferrari 2021, Auxier & Herstein 2017),\nwhile others use it to formulate notions of compositionality that can\nbe applied across domains from computer science to quantum physics\n(Coecke 2017). Also systematic connections between process structures\ncan be captured category-theoretically, as Phillips and Wilson (2010 )\nshow the case of the systematicity of cognitive capacities. Besides\nmereology and category theory, some authors explore formal dialectical\ntheories in order to describe the \u201clogic\u201d of real changes\n(Brenner and Igamberdiev 2021).\n\nThe fourth challenge is more fundamental. If any of the basic\ntheoretical terms of the many process philosophies, past and present,\nare to have explanatory value at all, there must be a way to tie the\nprocess philosopher\u2019s basic intuition to ordinary experience.\nAfter all, the purpose of philosophy is to enhance human\nunderstanding, and the core concepts of philosophical explanations\nmust in some fashion be anchored in what we intuitively understand\nfrom everyday experience. In fact, some process philosophers (e.g.,\nWhitehead) argue that the traditional notion of substance (a\ntime-invariant, necessarily uniquely located particular) precisely\nlacks any experiential grounding. On the other hand, substance\nontology has been capitalizing on the fact that the canonical\nillustrations of substances, things or living things, loom large in\nour practical interactions. The explanatory force of a process\nontology thus will depend on whether it is possible to identify a\nsimilarly salient canonical illustration for whatever technical notion\nof process is postulated as basic category. Some process approaches\nuse self-experience as anchoring canonical illustration for postulated\ntechnical notions of dynamic sameness and unity, but one might worry\nthat this model is all too complex.\n6. The ultimate question: is reality directed?\n\nAs emphasized throughout, process philosophy is a complex and highly\ndiversified field that is difficult to describe in more than general\nand disjunctive terms. In conclusion this section will highlight a\ntopic on which contemporary process philosophers are fundamentally\ndivided, to the extent that one group believes that the entire issue\nis ill-conceived.\n\nAs Rescher (1996, ch. 5) points out, processists fall into two\nprincipal camps. On the one side is the teleological (and often\ntheological) wing that sees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter\nof teleological directedness towards a positive destination. On the\nother side is the naturalistic (and generally secularist) wing that\nsees nature\u2019s processuality as a matter of an inner dynamicity\nwithout any directness or at least without any directedness towards a\nspecifiable destination. Both agree in according a central role to\ninherent dynamicity in nature. But the one (naturalistic) wing sees\nthis in terms of randomness that leads in arbitrary ways away from the\nsettled formulations of an established past, while the other\n(teleological) wing sees this in terms of a goal-directed\npurposiveness preestablished by some value-geared directive force.\n\nThe division between secular and theological process philosophy has\nits roots in the early phase of contemporary process thought in late\n19th and the first half of the 20th century, and centers on two views\nof evolutions. For secular, atheological processists evolution\ntypifies the creative workings of a self-sustaining nature that\nfulfills the vision of a certain positivist program, dispensing\naltogether with a God function to explain any of the events in or\nappertaining to the\n universe.[26]\n For theological processists like Teilhard de Chardin, however,\nevolution exhibits God\u2019s handwriting in the book of nature.\n\nPresent-day processists, who in the main no longer take Darwinian\nevolution as a concept or phenomenon that demands a commitment for or\nagainst theism, are wont to point to possible areas of agreement (see\nRescher ibid.). First, present-day processists point out that both\nsecular and theological protagonists of process thought can see\nevolution not only as a crucial instrument for understanding the role\nof intelligence in the world\u2019s scheme of things but also as a\nkey aspect of the world\u2019s natural development. In addition, both\nsecular and theological processists can agree that the evolutionary\nprocess provides process philosophy with one of its main models for\nhow large scale collective processes can inhere in and result from the\noperation of numerous small-scale individual processes, thus\naccounting for innovation and creativity also on a macro-level scale.\nSecond, present-day processists draw attention to the fact that early\nprocess thinkers were divided in their assessment of the phenomenon of\nevolution, since they failed to draw a division within the phenomenon\nof evolution itself. Undoubtedly, human intelligence is based on\nteleologically blind natural selection operating with random mutations\nto produce the neurophysiological capacities of the human brain.\nCultural evolution, on the other hand, does not share these features\nand could well appear as in some sense directed. For example, one\nmight argue that cultural evolution is generally Teilhardian, in that\nit is governed by a rationality-geared selection among purposefully\ndevised mutational variations. Cognitive evolution involves both\nbiological and cultural components, superimposing non-random rational\ndecision-making on biological selection. Our cognitive capacities and\nfaculties are part of the natural endowment we owe to biological\nevolution. But our cognitive methods, procedures, standards, and\ntechniques are socio-culturally developed resources that evolve\nthrough rationality-geared decision making in the process of cultural\ntransmission through successive generations. Our cognitive hardware\n(mechanisms and capacities) develops through Darwinian natural\nselection, but our cognitive software (the methods and procedures by\nwhich we transact our cognitive business) develops in a Teilhardian\nprocess of rationality-geared decision-making that involves purposeful\nintelligence-guided variation and selection. In the eyes of\npresent-day processists\u2014at least those that no longer pursue\nspeculative process thought\u2014it is for scientific research to\ndecide whether, and to what extent, the relationship between\nbiological and cognitive evolution can be understood on the analogy\nthat \u2018biology produces the instrument and culture writes the\nmusic,\u2019 with the instrument constraining the playable music, and\nnot vice versa (cf. Rescher 1996 ch. 5 and Rescher 2006 ch.\n10).\n\nThere is a middle ground between strict theological teleology on the\none hand, and, on the other hand, the naturalistic view that there is\nno final end that all processes are ultimately directed towards.\nAccording to this third alternative, a \u2018soft\u2019 version of\nthe teleological position, process is progress. For, so goes this line\nof reasoning, one can draw a lesson from evolutionary theory about\ncollective progress despite contingency and mortality at the scale of\nthe individual organism. In the small \u2013 i.e., item by item\n\u2013 nature\u2019s processes are self-canceling: what arises in\nthe course of time perishes in the course of time. But nevertheless,\nso the argument goes, (i) the overall course of processual change\ntends to the development of ever richer, more complex and\nsophisticated conditions of occurrence. Moreover, Darwinian\nevolutionism suggests (ii) that\n\n\n\u2026 the arrangements which do succeed in establishing and\nperpetuating themselves will as a general tendency manage to have done\nso because they represent actual improvements in one way or another.\n\u2026 Accordingly, fruitfulness in the long run compensates for\ntransiency and mortality at a smaller scale of occurrence. (Rescher\n1996: 102)\n\n\nThese two central premises for soft teleology are quite substantive,\nhowever. Premise (i) presupposes that (iii) there is a general and\ncomprehensive measure of simplicity or complexity that could be\napplied to natural and cultural processes in order to claim an overall\ntendency of development towards increased complexity; in particular,\nsuch a measure of complexity should make it possible to offset\ndecreases of complexity with respect to one parameter by increases in\ncomplexity relative to another parameter. Premise (ii) presupposes\nthat (iv) species survival can be taken as an indication of some\naspect that meaningfully can be connected to the axiology of progress.\nWhether the optimism of the soft teleological position is justified\nthus ultimately depends on the tenability of claims (iii) and\n (iv).[27]\n The fact that the premises for soft teleology have direct\nimplications for our current debate about transhumanism endows the old\nquestion of the directionality of reality with unexpected practical\nrelevance for the regulation of artificial intelligence and\nrobotics.\n7. Institutionalization\n\nProcess thought constituted a prominent sector of the active\nphilosophical scene in the USA during the first half of the 20th\ncentury. Apart from the proliferation of books and articles on the\ntopic, it has achieved considerable institutionalization in the USA\nduring the years after World War II. Indications of this phenomenon\ninclude the formation of the Society for Process Studies, as\nwell as the prominence of process philosophizing within the aegis of\nthe Society for American Philosophy and the American\nMetaphysical Society. Another clear token is the journal\nProcess Studies, published by the Center for Process\nStudies in Claremont CA, and founded in 1971 by Lewis S. Ford and\nJohn B. Cobb, Jr., a publication that has become a major vehicle for\narticle-length discussions in the field. Representatives of process\nphilosophy occupy influential posts in departments of philosophy and\nof religious studies in many of American universities and colleges,\nand some half-dozen doctoral dissertations are produced annually in\nthis field. But contemporary process philosophy is not geographically\nconfined. In 2002, the publishing house Ontos in Frankfurt, Germany,\nlaunched a book series on \u201cProcess Thought\u201d; though taken\nover by DeGruyter in 2015, over 25 volumes have appeared. In Europe\nthe Center for Practical Philosophy at the Universit\u00e9\ndu Louvain, Belgium, directed by Michel Weber, is a focal point for\nresearch on, and applications of, international process philosophy.\nThe Bulgarian Academy of Science recently created a Center for\nProcess Studies for philosophers and computer scientists. The\nGerman Whitehead Society regularly organizes conferences and\nsummer schools on both Whiteheadian and non-Whiteheadian process\nthought. The International Process Network, recently launched\nby Mark Dibben at the University of Tasmania, Australia, is a new web\ncommunity of international process philosophers of all philosophical\nproveniences East and West. Even though process philosophy is not\ninstitutionalized as such everywhere in the global field of\nphilosophy, it is a research paradigm that currently is in use all\naround the world.",
