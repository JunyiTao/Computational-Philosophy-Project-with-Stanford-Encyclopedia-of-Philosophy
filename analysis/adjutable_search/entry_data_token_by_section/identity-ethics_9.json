Prudential and Moral Units\n\n\nStrictly speaking, a metaphysical criterion of identity has no direct\nimplications whatsoever for normative matters, simply because what is\nthe case implies nothing about what ought to be the case. What people\nwho seek a relation between identity and ethics typically do, then, \nis appeal to considerations of identity to fill in some key blank \nregarding what the  ethically significant metaphysical units\nare. In other words, certain conclusions about identity are taken to \ninform us as to just what unifies the targets of prudential and moral\ntheorizing. Consider prudence, for example. In deliberating about \nwhat is in my best interest, what is needed is some conception of the\nscope of the \u201cmy\u201d in question, i.e., what unit \nmy deliberations are to cover. Similarly, with respect to moral \nresponsibility, we need to know whether the agent subject to \npraise or blame for some action is part of the same unit as the agent\nwho performed that action.\n\n\nBut notice that a specification of possible metaphysical unities alone\nwill not be sufficient, for what we need in addition is a\nspecification of which such unities are significant for\nethics. To see why this is an issue, consider just reductionism.\nReductionism is actually quite a general metaphysical view, holding at\nits most basic that the facts about identity simply consist in more\nparticular facts about brains, bodies, and so forth. But even if one\naccepts reductionism, and so abandons appeal to some further fact\nabout separately existing entities to explain personal identity, and\neven if one also believes that identity is not what matters in\nsurvival, one still has much work to do before being able to apply the\ntheory to ethics. This is because there are (at least) four\npossible metaphysical units that could be targeted for normative\ntheorizing. First, we might target living human beings, human\norganisms picked out by the Biological Criterion (and to some extent\nthe Anthropological View) and unified over time via biological\ncontinuity. These entities would endure from some early-stage fetuses\nuntil organismic death. Second, we might target Lockean\npersons, entities picked out by the Psychological Criterion\nand unified over time by psychological continuity (overlapping chains\nof strong psychological connectedness). These entities would endure\nfrom late infancy (or the time at which the various psychological\nconnections could be established) to brain death or perhaps\ndementia. Third, we might target selves, entities unified by\nstrong psychological connectedness. Such units would have significant\nduration, but they would not be likely to endure for as long as\npersons \u2013 insofar as memories typically fade, beliefs and\ndesires are lost or revised over time, and so forth \u2013 and they\ncertainly wouldn't endure as long as the life of the human being of\nwhich they were a part. Fourth, we might target atoms, or\nmomentary experiencers, \u201cunits\u201d defined and delimited by\nthe duration of an experience. It could be, after all, that if the\ndeep fact of identity is missing, there just are no other relations of\nsignificance we could legitimately substitute for it, so all that\nremains would be merely the basic atomic moments of people's\nlives. (For discussion of the last three possible units, see D.\nShoemaker 1999, 401; for a similar distinction, see Brink 1997b,\n110\u2013115, where he labels these last three possible units\n\u201cpersons,\u201d \u201cperson-segments,\u201d and\n\u201cperson-slices.\u201d)\n\n\nSo it is not enough that we articulate the various possible \nmetaphysical units. We must also figure out a way to identify \nwhich one we ought to target for ethics (or whether just one will do \nthe trick for all relevant forms of ethical theorizing). So in its \npurely metaphysical guise, reductionism must settle merely for \npresenting these four alternatives, remaining officially neutral on \nwhich one the ethicists should adopt. This two-step process \u2013 \nidentifying the possible metaphysical units, then narrowing down the \nlist to the ethically significant metaphysical units \u2013\nis often overlooked by those wishing to adopt metaphysical \nconclusions in their normative theorizing, but both steps are \nimportant (a notable exception to those who overlook this point is \nBrink; see his 1990, 1997a, and 1997b).\n\n\nOnce we make the switch from talk of identity to talk of unity \nrelations as being ethically significant, however, things can also \nget quite complicated. For there seems no reason in principle why two\nof the contending intrapersonal unity relations \u2013 psychological\ncontinuity and connectedness \u2013 could not also hold \ninterpersonally. That is, not only could psychological \ncontinuity, say, hold one-many, between me-now and more than one \nperson in the future, but it could also hold between me-now and other\nspatially distinct, simultaneously-existing persons (Brink 1997a, \n141\u2013143, 1997b, 125\u2013128). And the same could be true as well of \npsychological connectedness. At least \nsome of the psychological relations making up connectedness and \ncontinuity can obviously obtain interpersonally, e.g., sameness of \nbeliefs/desires/goals, and resemblance of character. But it also \nseems perfectly possible that memories and intentions may be shared \nbetween persons, produced by some common cause (Ibid.). \nRecognizing these connections widens the boundaries of what counts as\na targeted unit (and in so doing it may also blur the boundaries \nbetween prudence and morality), but the ensuing messiness may not be \nworth it. After all, if the proper ethical unit is a self, say, \nunified by psychological connectedness, which obtains by degrees, \nthat means that my unity with many others \u2013 and with future \nstages of myself \u2013 will be only partial, obtaining to various \npeople in varying degrees. But if these are the units targeted by \nethics, how do we mark their boundaries such that the moral concepts \nand principles coherently apply (McMahan 2002, 62)? In addition, who \nexactly would the practical agents in question be, where people are \nmore or less unified with each other (Brink 1997b, 113\u2013114)? And \nthere may also be worries about how to apply moral concepts admitting\nof no scalar dimensions \u2013 like promises \u2013 to moral units \n\u2013 like selves \u2013 that do (Williams 1976, 202\u2013204). These \nquestions (and more) pose genuine challenges for accounts allowing \nfor interpersonal unities.\nPerhaps in order to avoid these and other problems, Marya\nSchechtman proposes her Anthropological View as driven by the question\nof what units are the proper object of all of our\nperson-related practical concerns.  As already noted, she thinks the\nonly way to unite all of them is by focusing on the human animal, one\nthat lives our form of life.  This allows her to say that the fetus is\nthe same thing as the infant, which is the same as the teenager, the\nadult, and the demented grandparent, one individual treated as the\nsame locus of a host of practical concerns over the course of that\nlife.  This view effectively blocks the possibilities, raised above,\nof some concerns cutting across individual lives, but this may prevent\nthe Anthropological View from being able to explain some features of\ncommonsense morality that the interpersonal unities view can.\n",
