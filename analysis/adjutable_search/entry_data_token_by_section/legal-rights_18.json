    "main_text": "Legal Rights as Reasons || Conflicts of Rights\n8.5 Conflicts of Rights\n\nAs reasons, rights can conflict within practical reasoning (Wellman\n1995: 202\u2013203). The paradigm of a conflict of rights involves\nincompatible claims (Waldron 1993: 206; Kamm 2002: 499\u2013500).\nMoreover, rights can conflict when the practical conditions for their\napplication are incompatible (Wellman 1995: 200\u2013202). Thus,\nWellman contends that \u201ctwo rights conflict when both cannot be\nexercised and enjoyed fully in any given situation\u201d (1995: 202).\n\n\nA helpful distinction in this context is between \u201cabstract\nrights\u201d, which are rights expressing broad aims, and\n\u201cconcrete rights\u201d, which are specific as to their\napplication to concrete cases (Dworkin 1977: 93\u201394). At high\nlevels of abstraction, it is largely unproblematic that legal rights\nare at least seemingly incompatible; as such rights tend to imply\nrather vague and not fully determined demands (Feinberg 1973: 71). For\nexample, although people\u2019s right to freedom can appear to\nconflict with others\u2019 right to equality, these two rights can\nco-exist relatively peaceably in the same legal system. It is when\nmaking more concrete prescriptions that conflicts of legal rights pose\nmore of a challenge (Feinberg 1973: 69, 72). While the distinction\nbetween \u201cabstract\u201d and \u201cconcrete\u201d is a matter\nof degree, a clear case of conflicting concrete rights is of two legal\nrights for the exclusive possession of the same item at the same time.\n\n\nConflicts of rights are sometime dissolved by redrawing the scope of\nthe conflicting rights so as to avoid overlap (Feinberg 1973:\n72\u201373; Wellman 1995: 202\u2013210). Yet, law and morality can\nat times resist such harmonizing via adjustment in scope (Wellman\n1995: 211\u2013215). \n\nTo resolve these conflicts, law can designate a hierarchy or priority\namong types of rights\u2014so that some rights, at least under\ncertain conditions, preempt others (Feinberg 1973: 76\u201379;\nWellman 1995: 215). For example, in Marsh v Alabama (1945)\nthe U.S. Supreme Court held that:\n\n\nWhen we balance the Constitutional rights of owners of property\nagainst those of the people to enjoy freedom of press and religion, as\nwe must here, we remain mindful of the fact that the latter occupy a\npreferred position \u2026 As we have stated before, the right to\nexercise the liberties safeguarded by the First Amendment\n\u201clies at the foundation of free government by free men\u201d,\nand we must in all cases \u201cweigh the circumstances and \u2026\nappraise the \u2026 reasons \u2026 in support of the regulation of\n(those) rights\u201d. (509)\n\n\nWhen no such hierarchy obtains, conflicts are resolvable through some\nform of balancing of the rights\u2019 respective normative weight or\nforce. For instance, Thomson suggests balancing the interests\nprotected by the competing rights (Thomson 1990: 149\u2013175).\nRelatedly, Waldron suggests that when conflicting rights promote\nrelated interests, the right that best promotes that type of interest\nought to prevail (Waldron 1993: 222\u2013223). In fact, courts often\nresolve conflicts of rights by balancing the respective interests that\nthose rights protect as well as each rights\u2019 other respective\njustifying reasons (Wellman 1995: 209\u2013210). Critical of both\nThomson and Waldron, Kamm offers tests of her own for settling\nconflicts of rights (2001: 251\u2013255; 2002: 500\u2013506; 2007:\n263\u2013272), as does Gewirth (1978).\n",
