    "main_text": "Background Concepts || The relevant kinds of wrongs\n2.2 The relevant kinds of wrongs\n\nNot all wrongdoing justifies a punitive response. Which kinds of\nwrongs can be morally fitting bases for punishment is a much-debated\ntopic (Shafer-Landau 1996: 289\u2013292; Husak 2008; Asp 2013),\nbeyond the scope of the present entry. Nonetheless, a few comments may\nbe helpful.\n\nThe paradigmatic wrong for which punishment seems appropriate is an\nintentional or knowing violation of the important rights of another,\nsuch as murder or rape. It is almost as clear that an attempt to do\nthe same is a proper basis for punishment, though how to define the\nconcept of an attempt is highly contested (Duff 1996; Alexander,\nFerzan, & Morse 2009: ch. 6; Yaffe 2010). The more tenuous the\nconnection to a rights violation, and the less culpable the mental\nstate, the more controversial punishment for an act or omission\nbecomes. This raises special problems for purely regulatory (mala\nprohibita) offenses (for a critical discussion of mala\nprohibita offenses, see Husak 2008: 103\u2013119; Duff 2018:\n313\u2013322) and for the punishment of negligent acts (for criticism\nof punishing negligent acts, see Alexander, Ferzan, & Morse 2009:\nch. 3; for a defense of punishing negligent acts, see Stark 2016: chs.\n7 & 8).\n\nAn important dimension of debate is whether all moral wrongs are at least\npresumptively a proper basis for punishment (Moore 1997: 35\u201337),\nor whether only a subset of moral wrongs are a proper basis\npunishment. One prominent way to delimit the relevant wrongs, at least\nfor state punishment, is to say that only public wrongs may\nbe the basis for punishment. (Duff 2018: 75\u201387; Duff &\nHoskins 2017 [2019]: \u00a72; for a criticism of Duff\u2019s view of\npublic wrongs, see Tadros 2016: 120\u2013130).\n\nAnother important debate concerns the \u201charm principle\u201d\n(see Mill 1859: ch. 1). It is often said that only those moral wrongs\nthat cause harm can properly serve as the basis for punishment. But\nthe harm principle, on any of a number of interpretations, is too\nrestrictive to be consistent with retributive justice, which, unlike\nthe harm principle, calls for giving the wrongdoer his just deserts\neven if no other good (such as the prevention of harm) should follow\n(Tomlin 2014a). (For a short survey of variations on the harm\nprinciple and their problems, see Tadros 2016: 102\u2013107.)\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that retributive justice is\nnot limited to liberal moral and political philosophy. Retributive\njustice may also be deemed appropriate by illiberal persons and inside\ndistinctly illiberal organizations (Zaibert 2006: 16\u201324).\nIlliberal persons and groups may also make a distinction between\nwrongs that call for punishment and those that do not, but they will\nnot draw the distinction in the same way that liberals would.\n",
