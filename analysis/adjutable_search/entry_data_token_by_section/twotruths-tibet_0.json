    "main_text": "Nyingma\n1. Nyingma\n\nLongchen Rabjam sets out the course of the Nyingma theory of the\ntruths and the later philosophers of the school took similar stance\nwithout varying much in essence. In Treasure he begins the\nsection on the Madhyamaka theory of the two truths as follows:\n\u201cThe Madhyamaka tradition is the secret and profound teachings\nof the [\u015a\u0101kya]m\u016bni. Although it constitues five\nontological categories, the two truths subsume them\u201d (Longchen,\n1983: 204f).\n\nNyingma defines conventional truth as consisting of unreal phenomena\nthat appear to be real to the erroneous cognitive processes of the\nordinary beings while ultimate truth is reality which transcends any\nmode of thinking and speech, one that unmistakenly appears to the\nnonerroneous cognitive processes of the exalted and awakened beings.\nIn other words (1) ultimate truth represents the perspective of\nepistemically correct and warranted cognitive process of exalted\nbeings (\u2018phags pa); whereas (2) conventional truth represents\nthe perspective of epistemically deceptive and unwarranted cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings (Mipham Rinpoche 1993d:\n543\u2013544).\n\nLet us consider these two definitions turn by turn. Nyingma supports\ndefinition (1) with two premises. The first one says that cognitive\nprocesses of the exalted (\u2018phags pa) and awakened beings (sang\nrgyas) are epistemically correct and non-deceptive, because \u201cIt\nis in relation to this cognitive content that the realisation of the\nultimate truth is so designated. The object of an exalted cognitive\nprocess consists of the way things really are (gshis kyi gnas lugs),\nphenomena as they really are (chos kyi dbyings) which is undefiled by\nits very nature (rang bzin dag pa)\u201d (Longchen 1983: 202f).\nHowever ultimate truth for Nyingma is not an object per se in the\nusual sense of the word. It is object only in the metaphorical sense.\n\u201cFrom the [ultimate] perspective the meditative equipoise of the\nrealised (sa thob) and awakened beings (sangs rgyas), there exists\nneither object of knowledge (shes bya) nor knowing cognitive process\n(shes byed) and so forth, for there is neither object to apprehend nor\nthe subject that does the apprehending. Even the exalted cognitive\nprocess (yeshes) as a subject ceases (zhi ba) to operate\u201d\n(Longchen 1983: 201f). Therefore \u201cAt this stage, [Nyingma]\naccepts the total termination (chad) of all the continua\n(rgyun) of the cognitive processes (\u2018jug pa) of the mind (sems)\nand mental factors (sems las byung ba). This exalted cognitive process\nwhich is inexpressible beyond words and thoughts (smra bsam brjod du\nmed pa'i yeshes), and thus is designated (btags pa) as a\ncorrect and unmistaken cognitive process (yang dag\npa'i blo ma khrul ba) as it knows the reality as it is\u201d\n(Longchen 1983:201f).\n\nThe second premise comes from Nyingma\u2019s transcendent theory. According\nto this theory ultimate truth constitutes reality and the reality\nconstitutes transcendence of all elaborations. Reality is that which\ncannot be comprehended by the means of linguistic and conceptual\nelaboration, as it is utterly beyond the grasp of words and thoughts\nwhich merely defile the cognitive states. Given that exalted beings\nare free of defiled mental states, all forms of thoughts and\nconceptions are terminated in their realization of the ultimate truth.\nUltimate truth transcends all elaborations, thus remains untouched by\nthe philosophical speculations (Longchen, 1983: 203f). \u201cIn short\nthe characteristic of [ultimate truth] is that of nirv\u0101\u1e47a,\nwhich is profound and peaceful. It is intrinsically unadulterated\ndomain (dbyings). The cognitive process by means of which ultimate\ntruth is realized must therefore be free from all cognitive\nlimitations (sgribs pa), for it is disclosed to the awakened beings\n(sangs rgyas) in whose exalted cognitive processes appear the objects\nas they really are without being altered\u201d (Longchen, 1983:\n204f).\n\nNyingma\u2019s defence of the definition (2) also has two premises. The\nfirst one comes from its theory of error, the most commonly used by\nthe Nyingma philosophers. According to this theory, conventional truth\nis, as matter of fact, an error confined to the ordinary beings (so so\nskye bo) who are blinded by the dispositions (bag chags) of confusion\n(ma rig pa). It is argued that under the sway of confusion the\nordinary beings falsely and erroneously believe in the reality of\nentirely unreal entities and the truth of wholly false epistemic\ninstruments, just like the people who mistakenly grasps cataracts and\nfalling hairs to be real objects. Conventional truths are mere errors\nthat appear real to the ordinary beings, but they are in fact no more\nreal than the falling hairs that are reducible into the \u201cmodes\nof apprehensions\u201d (snang tshul) (Mipham Rinpoche\n1993c: 3, 1977: 80\u201381ff, 1993d: 543\u2013544).\n\nThe second premise comes from its representationalist or\nelaboration-theory which says that conventional truths constitute\nmerely mental elaborations (spros pa) represented to appear (rnam par\nsnang ba) in the minds of the ordinary beings as if they are realities\nhaving the subject-object relation. They are thus deceptive since they\nare produced through the power of the underlying cognitive confusion\nor ignorance, and that they do not cohere with any corresponding\nreality externally. Confusion is sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti because\nit conceals (sgrib) the nature, it fabricates all conditioned\nphenomena to appear as if they are real. Even though conventional\ntruths are to be eventually eradicated (spang bya), the\nrepresentational images of the conventional reality will nevertheless\ncontinue to appear in the minds of even those who are highly realized\nbeings, that is, until they achieved a complete cessation of mind and\nmental states (Longchen, 1983: 203f). It is argued that when the eye\nthat is affected by cataracts mistakenly sees hairs falling in\ncontainers, the healthy eye that is not affected by cataracts does not\neven perceive the appearances of falling hairs. Likewise, those who\nare affected by the cataracts of afflictive confusion see things as\nintrinsically real, hence for them things are conventionally real.\nThose noble beings who are free from the afflictive confusion and the\nawakened beings who are free from even the non-afflictive confusion\nsee things as they are (ultimate truth). Just as the person without\ncataracts does not see the falling hairs, the noble beings and\nawakened beings do not see any reality of things at all.\n\nMipham Rinpoche also proposes another definition of the two truths\nwhich diverges significantly from the one we saw. As we saw Longchen\u2019s\ndefinition is based on two radically opposed epistemic criteria\nwhereas Mipham\u2019s definition, as we shall see, has two radically\nopposed ontological criteria\u2014one that withstands reasoned\nanalysis and the other that does not withstand reasoned analysis. In\nhis Clearing Dhamchoe\u2019s Doubts (Dam chos dogs sel),\nMipham says that: \u201cReality as it is (de bzhin nyid) is\nestablished as ultimately real (bden par grub pa). Conventional\nentities are actually established as unreal, they are subject to\ndeception. Being devoid of such characteristics ultimate is\ncharacterized as real, not unreal and not non-deceptive. If this\n[reality] does not exist,\u201d in Mipham\u2019s view, \u201cthan it\nwould be impossible even for the noble beings (\u0101rya / phags pa)\nto perceive reality. They would, instead, perceive objects that are\nunreal and deceptive. If that is the case, everyone would be ordinary\nbeings. There would be no one who will attain liberation\u201d\n(1993a: 602).\n\nMipham anticipates objections to his definition from his Gelug\nopponents when he writes, \u201cSomeone may object: although ultimate\ntruth is real (bden p), its reality is not established ultimately\n(bden grub), because to be established ultimately is for it to\nwithstands reasoned analysis (rigs pas dpyad bzod)\u201d (Mipham\n1993a: 603). The response from Mipham makes it even clearer.\n\u201cConventional truth is not ultimately real (bden par grub pa)\nbecause it is not able to withstand reasoned analysis, in spite of the\nfact that those that are conventionally real (yang dag kun rdzob) are\nnominally real (tha snyad du bden pa) and are the objects of the\ndualistic cognitive processes\u201d (Mipham 1993a: 603). In contrast:\n\u201cReality (dharmat\u0101 / chos nyid), ultimate truth,\nis really established (bden par grub pa) on the ground that it is\nestablished as the object of nondual exalted cognitive\nprocess. Besides, it withstands reasoned analysis, for no\nlogical reasoning whatsoever can undermine it or destroy it.\nFor that reason so long as it does not withstand reasoned analysis, it\nis not ultimate, it would be conventional entity\u201d (Mipham\n1993a: 603). According to Mipham\u2019s argument, that an object that cannot\nwithstand reasoned analysis is the kind of object that mundane\ncognitive processes find dually, and it is not the kind of object\nfound by the exalted cognitive processes that perceive ultimate truth\nnondually (Mipham 1993a: 603).\n\nAs we have noticed, Mipham\u2019s definition seems to have departed from\nLongchen\u2019s some what significantly. In the final analysis, however,\nthere does not seem to be much variation. Mipham Rinpoche also is\ncommitted to the representationalist argument to ascend to nonduality:\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d he says, \u201cthere are no external\nobjects. It is evident that they appear due to the force of mental\nimpressions \u2026 All texts that supposedly demonstrate the\nexistence of external objects are provisional [descriptions of] their\nappearances\u201d(Mipham 1977: 159\u201360ff). Consequently whatever\nappears to exist externally, according to Nyingma, \u201cis like a\nhorse or an elephant appearing in a dream. When it is subjected to\nlogical analysis, it finally boils down to the interdependent inner\npredispositions. And this is at the heart of Buddhist\nphilosophy\u201d (Mipham 1977: 159\u201360ff).\n\nFollowing on from its definition, Nyingma argues that there is no one\nentity that can be taken as the basis from which divides the two\ntruths; since there is no one entity which is both real (true) and\nunreal (false). Hence it proposes the two truths division based on the\ntwo types of epistemic practices \u201cbecause it confirms a direct\nopposition between that which is free of the elaborations and that\nwhich is not free of the elaborations, and between what is to be\naffirmed and what is to be negated excluding the possibility of the\nthird alternative. Thus it ascertains the two\u201d (Longchen, 1983:\n205\u2013206ff). Nyingma has two key arguments to support the claim\nthe two truths division is an epistemic. The first argument states,\n\u201cIt is definite that we posit the objects (yul rnams) in\ndependence upon the subjects (yul can). The subjects are exclusively\ntwo types\u2014they are either ultimately (mthar thug pa) fallacious\ncognitive processes (khrul ba'i blo) or ultimately (mthar thug pa)\nnon-fallacious cognitive processes (ma \u2018khrula ba'i blo). The\nfallacious cognitive processes posit [conventional truth]\u2014all\nsa\u1e43s\u0101ric phenomena\u2014whereas as the non-fallacious\ncognitive processes posit the [ultimate] reality. Therefore it is due\nto the cognitive processes that we posit the objects in terms of two\n[truths]\u201d (Longchen, 1983: 206f) The second argument states that\nultimate truth is not an objective domain of the cognitive processes\nwith the representational images (dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod yul), for\nthe reason that it may be known by means of the exalted cognitive\nprocesses (yeshes) with no representational image (dmigs pa med).\n(Longchen, 1983: 206f) In contrast conventional truth is an objective\ndomain of the cognitive processes with the representational images\n(dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod yul), for the reason that it may be known\nby means of the cognitive processes having the representational images\n(dmigs bcas kyi blo'i spyod ul).\n\nNyingma categorically rejects commitment to any philosophical\nposition, for it would entail a commitment to, at least, some forms of\nelaborations. This is so since \u201cthe Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\nrejects all philosophical systems, and does not accept any self-styled\nphilosophical elaboration (rang las spros pas grub mtha\u2019).\n(Longchen, 1983: 210ff) The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika therefore presents\nthe theory of the two truths and so forth by merely designating them\nin accordance with the mundane fabrications (sgro btags) (Longchen\n1983: 211f). \u201cTherefore ultimate truth which is transcendent of\nall elaborations cannot be expressed either as identical to or\nseparate from the conventional truth. They are rather merely\ndifferent in terms of negating the oneness (Longchen,\n1983: 192\u20133ff, Mipham 1977: 84f). Interestingly Mipham\nRinpoche also says that \u201cthe two truths constitute a single\nentity but different conceptual identities (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa\ntha dad). \u201cThis is because,\u201d he says,\n\u201cappearance and emptiness are indistinguishable. This is\nascertained through reliable cognitions (tshad ma) by means of which\nthe two truths are investigated. What appears is empty. If emptiness\nwere to exist separately from what appears, the reality of that\n[apparent] phenomenon would not be empty. Thus the two [truths] are\nnot distinct\u201d (Mipham 1977: 81f). The identity of ultimate truth\nat issue here, according to Mipham, is that of absolute ultimate (rnam\ngrangs min pa'i don dam ste), rather than provisional ultimate. This\nis because the kind of ultimate truth under discussion when we are\ndiscussing its relation with conventional truth is the ultimate truth\n\u201cwhich is beyond the bound of any expression, although it is an\nobject of direct perception\u201d (Mipham 1977: 81f).\n",
