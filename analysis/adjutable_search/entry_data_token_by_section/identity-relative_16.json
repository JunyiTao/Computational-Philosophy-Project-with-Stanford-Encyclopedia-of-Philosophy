    "main_text": "The Paradoxes Reconsidered || Church\u2019s Paradox\n4.6 Church\u2019s Paradox\n\nChurch\u2019s argument implies that if Pierre\u2019s doxastic\nposition is as described (in \u00a72.6), then London and Londres are\ndistinct objects. Assuming the standard account of identity, the\nresult is that either Pierre\u2019s doxastic position cannot\nbe as described or else London and Londres are different\ncities (or else we must punt). Since London and Londres are\nnot different cities, the standard account entails that Pierre\u2019s\ndoxastic position cannot be as described (or else we must punt). This\nwas Church\u2019s own position as regards certain puzzles about\nsynonymy, such as Mates\u2019 puzzle (Mates 1952). Church held that\none who believes that lawyers are lawyers, must indeed believe that\nlawyers are attorneys, despite any refusal to assent to (or desire to\ndissent from) \u201cLawyers are attorneys\u201d (Church 1954).\nKripke later argued (Kripke 1979) that assent and failure to assent\nmust be taken at face value (at least in the case of Pierre) and\nPierre\u2019s doxastic position is as described. Kripke chose to\npunt\u2014concluding that the problem is a problem for any\n\u201clogic\u201d of belief. The relativist concludes instead that\n(a) Pierre\u2019s doxastic position is as described, (b) if so,\nLondon and Londres are distinct objects, and (c) London and Londres\nare nonetheless the same city. Whether this resolution of\nChurch\u2019s paradox can be exploited to yield solutions to\nFrege\u2019s puzzle (Salmon 1986) or Kripke\u2019s puzzle (1979)\nremains to be seen. Crimmins (1998) has suggested that the analysis of\npropositional attitudes requires a notion of \u201csemantic\npretense\u201d. In reporting Pierre\u2019s doxastic position we\nengage in a pretense to the effect that London and Londres are\ndifferent cities associated with different Fregean senses.\nCrimmins\u2019 goal is to reconcile (a), (c) and the following, (d):\nthat the pure semantics of proper names (\u201cLondon\u201d,\n\u201cLondres\u201d) is Millian or directly referential (Kripke\n1979). The relativist proposes just such a reconciliation but suggests\nthat the pretense can be dropped.\n",
