    "main_text": "Theoretical Approaches || Bayesian\n4.8 Bayesian\n\nBayesian models are prominent in cognitive science, with applications\nto such psychological phenomena as learning, vision, motor control,\nlanguage, and social cognition. They have also had effective\napplications in robotics. The Bayesian approach assumes that cognition\nis approximately optimal in accord with probability theory, especially\nBayes\u2019 theorem, which says that the probability of a hypothesis\ngiven evidence is equal to the result of multiplying the prior\nprobability of the hypothesis by the conditional probability of the\nevidence given the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of the\nevidence. The explanatory schema for Bayesian cognition is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nHow does the mind carry out functions such as inference?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nThe mind has representations for statistical correlations and\nconditional probabilities.\nThe mind has the capacity for probabilistic computations such as\napplications of Bayes\u2019 theorem.\nApplying probabilistic computations to statistical representations\naccomplishes mental tasks such as inference.\n\n\n\nAlthough Bayesian methods have had impressive applications to a wide\nrange of phenomena, their psychological plausibility is debatable\nbecause of assumptions about optimality and computations based on\nprobability theory.\n",
