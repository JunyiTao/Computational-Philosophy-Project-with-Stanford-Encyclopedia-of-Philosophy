    "main_text": "Features Salient to Legal Rights || Institutional Rights\n10.1 Institutional Rights\n\nMany of the features salient specifically to legal rights\narise from law being an institutional system of norms (Raz 1979:\n103\u2013121), largely oriented towards action-guiding and towards\naspects of human behavior that can be adjudicated (Raz 1994:\n255\u2013259). Ingrained in law, legal rights, therefore, tend to\nexhibit a practical orientation and institutional features less\ndominant in non-institutional rights, such as being subject to\n(in)validation, recognition, adjudication, legislation, enforcement,\nand inclusive of and nested in a rich network of procedures. \n\nLegal rights also exhibit features absent or more muted in rights\nfound in normative systems of non-legal institutions, such as social\nclubs, trade unions, or universities. Features derived from\nlaw\u2019s relative greater social importance; law\u2019s claim to\nsupremacy over other institutional normative systems under law\u2019s\njurisdiction; the far greater range of activities that can and\ntypically do fall under law\u2019s domain; law\u2019s\ncompulsoriness; and, law\u2019s commonly greater use of remedies,\nsanctions, and violence (Raz 1979: 115\u2013121; Sumner 1987:\n70\u201379). \n",
