The reasoning that\ntakes place in our scientific engagement with the world, Mill holds,\nis simply the application of a particularly refined version of such\nenumerative induction. \n\n\n[T]he most scientific proceeding can be no more than an improved form\nof that which was primitively pursued by the human understanding while\nundirected by science. (System, VII: 318) \n\n\nImprovement to inductive methodology comes by theoretical\nreason\u2019s reflective self-examination\u2014inductive\nconsideration of induction itself.\n\n\nExperience testifies, that among the uniformities which it exhibits or\nseems to exhibit, some are more to be relied on than others [\u2026]\nThis mode of correcting one generalization by means of another, a\nnarrower generalization by a wider, which common sense suggests and\nadopts in practice, is the real type of scientific Induction.\n(System, VII: 319)\n\n\nThe history of science, as Mill sees it, is the history of the growth\nof our knowledge by inductive reason, but also the growth of\nour knowledge of inductive reason. As we learn more about the\nworld, induction becomes more and more established, and with this it\nbecomes self-critical and systematic.\n\n\u201c[W]e may discover, by mere observation without experiment, a\nreal uniformity in nature\u201d (System, VII: 386). Where\npossible, however, engaging in experimental activity is the most\ndirect way to uncover the causal relations between events, because it\nallows us to \u201cmeet with some of the antecedents apart from the\nrest, and observe what follows from them; or some of the consequents,\nand observe by what they are preceded\u201d (System, VII:\n381). Mill claims that, as science has progressed, four methods have\nemerged as successful in isolating causes of observed phenomena\n(System, VII: 388\u2013406; see Cobb 2017: 240\u20131). Firstly,\nthe Method of Agreement: where instances of phenomenon A are\nalways accompanied with phenomenon a, even when other\ncircumstances accompanying A are varied, we have reason to\nbelieve that A and a are causally related. Secondly, the\nMethod of Difference: where the only distinguishing feature marking\nsituations in which phenomenon a occurs or does not occur is\nthe presence or absence of phenomenon A, there is reason to\nthink that A is an indispensable part of the cause of a.\n(If we have noted, via the Method of Agreement, that in all instances\nof A, a is present, we can, where possible,\nsystematically withdraw A, to determine whether A is a\ncause of a by the Method of Difference. Mill terms this the\nJoint Method of Agreement and Difference.) Thirdly, the Method of\nResidues: against the knowledge that A is the cause of\na, and B the cause of b, where ABC\ncauses abc, and AB causes merely ab, we can\n(by ruling out that c is the joint effect of AB)\nregard C as the cause of c. Fourthly, the Method of\nConcomitant Variations: whenever a varies when A varies\nin some particular manner, a may be thought to be causally\nconnected to A.\n\nSuch methods must, of course, be applied cautiously\u2014the\nexistence of background conditions makes it difficult to say with\ncertainty that any individual phenomenon is in fact the causally\nactive agent\u2014and results will always be provisional, and open to\nfurther correction (Ducheyne 2008). But by carefully varying\nconditions, Mill holds, we can isolate causes and reveal the laws\nwhich govern natural phenomena. We learn first to explain individual\nevents by showing that they are instances of known causal laws, and\nthen \u201cin a similar manner, a law or uniformity in nature is said\nto be explained, when another law or laws are pointed out, of which\nthat law itself is but a case\u201d (System, VII: 464). By\ncontinued application of the Canons of Induction, the most general\nLaws of Nature can be ascertained\u2014this is the ultimate goal of\nscience. Mill adopts a Humean account of such laws as regularities:\n\u201cThe expression, Laws of Nature, means nothing but the\nuniformities which exist among natural phenomena\u201d\n(System, VII: 318). Nevertheless, he thinks that science\nreveals the deep structure of the world\u2014how things genuinely\nare.\n\n\nKepler did not put what he had conceived into the facts, but\nsaw it in them. A conception implies, and corresponds to,\nsomething conceived: and though the conception itself is not in the\nfacts, but in our mind, yet if it is to convey any knowledge relating\nto them, it must be a conception of something which really is\nin the facts, some property which they actually possess, and which\nthey would manifest to our senses, if our senses were able to take\ncognizance of it. (System, VII: 295; cf. System,\nVII: 651)\n\n\nMill\u2019s insistence that the process of science involves finding\nthe structure already present in nature gives his philosophy\na realist orientation. Perhaps the clearest instance of such realism\nin his work, however, is the claim that \u201cKinds have a real\nexistence in nature\u201d (System, VII: 122). Scientific\nanalysis of nature, Mill holds, uncovers a \u201cradical distinction\nin the things themselves\u201d (System, VII: 123). \n\n\nIn so far as a natural classification is grounded on real Kinds, its\ngroups are certainly not conventional; it is perfectly true that they\ndo not depend upon an arbitrary choice of the naturalist.\n(System, VIII: 720) \n\n\nSuch Kinds are marked not by the possession of some metaphysical\nessence\u2014but by their marking \u201can indeterminate multitude\nof properties not derivable from one another\u201d (System,\nVII: 126). Some groups of objects share characteristics because those\ncharacteristics are the very grounds of their being grouped\ntogether\u2014Real kinds share an unknown number of similarities\nbecause they have a shared nature. The notion is closely, though not\nunproblematically, related to the modern notion of a Natural Kind\n(Magnus 2015).\n\nBecause Mill\u2019s naturalism commits him to the principle that\n\u201c[t]he laws of our rational faculty [\u2026] are only learnt\nby seeing the agent at work\u201d, the investigation of scientific\nmethodology pursued in the System of Logic takes the form of\na theoretical investigation of lessons learnt from the history of\nsuccessful scientific practice. It is perhaps odd, then, that Mill\nhimself was not a historian of science of any real depth. As a matter\nof biographical fact, Mill\u2019s knowledge of this topic was derived\nprincipally from secondary sources\u2014William Whewell\u2019s\nHistory of Inductive Science, John Herschel\u2019s\nDiscourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and August\nComte\u2019s Cours de Positive Philosophie\u2014and the\nsections of the System which make significant appeal to the\nhistory of science were significantly indebted to the research\nconducted on his behalf by Alexander Bain (Autobiography, I:\n215\u20137, 255; Bain 1904: 137, 141). Had Mill been better\nacquainted with the history of actual scientific practice, it is\nquestionable whether he would have insisted that the story of\nscientific progress is simply the story of the steady use of\nobservation and induction\u2014whether the Canons of Induction really\nare exhaustive of the way in which scientific investigation\nhas enabled humans to obtain knowledge of the world. A detailed\nanthropological study of the history of successful scientific practice\nis likely to reveal the irreducible use of imaginative\nhypothesis-making\u2014not to mention changing questions and ideals\nof the sort later highlighted by Thomas Kuhn (1962). Such was the\nbasis for a telling historico-normative debate between Whewell and\nMill\u2014the former arguing that scientific reasoning had and should\ninvolve the creative a priori development of concepts prior\nto the discovery of laws, the latter claiming, as can be seen in the\nquote above, that observation and induction alone could track facts\nabout the world and elicit the concepts used in science (Snyder\n2006).\n",
