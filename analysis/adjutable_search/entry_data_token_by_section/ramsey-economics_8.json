The Ramsey Rule and Its Ramifications\n\n\nWe now construct an informal version of the variational argument\nRamsey used for determining \\(\\{C^*(t)\\}\\) in Mark\nIII. Loosely speaking, the DMs require the marginal rate of\nethically indifferent substitution between consumption at any two brief\nperiods of time to equal the marginal rate at which consumption can be\ntransformed between those same pair of brief periods of time. Their\nequality (i.e., the right balance from among the\n\u201cdesirables\u201d and the \u201cfeasibles\u201d) is a\nnecessary property of an optimum consumption stream.\n\n\nRamsey constructed a mathematical expression of the property, but\ndid not look for conditions that, taken together, are both necessary\nand sufficient. We will use a simple example, which is also in\nhis paper, to show how a sufficient condition can be obtained.\n",
