A Result of the Co-evolutionary Research Ideology: Philosophy\u2019s Emphasis on Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience\n\nWhat neuroscience has now discovered about the cellular and molecular\nmechanisms of neural conductance and transmission is spectacular.\nThese results constitute one of the crowning achievements of\nscientific inquiry. (For those in doubt, simply peruse for five\nminutes a recent volume of Society for Neuroscience\nAbstracts.) Less comprehensive, yet still spectacular, are\ndiscoveries at \u201chigher\u201d levels of neuroscience: circuits,\nnetworks, and systems. All this is a natural outcome of increasing\nscientific specialization. We develop the technology, the experimental\ntechniques, and ultimately the experimental results-driven theories\nwithin specific disciplines to push forward our understanding. Still,\na crucial aspect of the total picture sometimes gets neglected: the\nrelationship between the levels, the \u201cglue\u201d that binds\nknowledge of neuron activity to subcellular and molecular mechanisms\n\u201cbelow\u201d, and to circuit, network, and systems activity\npatterns \u201cabove\u201d. This problem is especially glaring when\nwe try to relate \u201ccognitivist\u201d psychological theories,\npostulating information-bearing representations and processes\noperating over their contents, to neuronal activities.\n\u201cCo-evolution\u201d between these explanatory levels still\nseems more a distant dream than an operative methodology guiding\nday-to-day scientific research.\n\nIt is here that some philosophers and neuroscientists turned to\ncomputational methods (Churchland and Sejnowski 1992). One hope was\nthat the way computational models have functioned in more developed\nsciences, like in physics, might provide a useful model. One\ncomputational resource that has usefully been applied in more\ndeveloped sciences to similar \u201ccross-level\u201d concerns are\ndynamical systems. Global phenomena, such as large-scale\nmeteorological patterns, have been usefully addressed as dynamical,\nnonlinear, and often chaotic interactions between lower-level physical\nphenomena. Addressing the interlocking levels of theory and\nexplanation in the mind/brain using computational resources that have\nworked to bridge levels in more mature sciences might yield comparable\nresults. This methodology is necessarily interdisciplinary, drawing on\nresources and researchers from a variety of levels, including higher\nones like experimental psychology, artificial intelligence, and\nphilosophy of science.\n\nThe use of computational methods in neuroscience itself is not new.\nHodgkin, Huxley, and Katz (1952) incorporated values of\nvoltage-dependent sodium and potassium conductance they had measured\nexperimentally in the squid giant axon into an equation from physics\ndescribing the time evolution of a first-order kinetic process. This\nequation enabled them to calculate best-fit curves for modeled\nconductance versus time data that reproduced the changing membrane\npotential over time when action potentials were generated. Also using\nequations borrowed from physics, Rall (1959) developed the cable model\nof dendrites. This model provided an account of how the various inputs\nfrom across the dendritic tree interact temporally and spatially to\ndetermine the input-output properties of single neurons. It remains\ninfluential today, and was incorporated into the GENESIS software\nfor programming neurally realistic networks (Bower and Beeman 1995;\nsee discussion in\n section 2 above).\n David Sparks and his colleagues showed that a vector-averaging model\nof activity in neurons of superior colliculi correctly predicts\nexperimental results about the amplitude and direction of saccadic eye\nmovements (Lee, Rohrer, and Sparks 1988). Working with a more\nsophisticated mathematical model, Apostolos Georgopoulos and his\ncolleagues predicted direction and amplitude of hand and arm movements\nbased on averaged activity of 224 cells in motor cortex. Their\npredictions were borne out under a variety of experimental tests\n(Georgopoulos, Schwartz, and Kettner 1986). We mention these\nparticular studies only because these are ones with which we are\nfamiliar. No doubt we could multiply examples of the fruitful\ninteraction of computational and experimental methods in neuroscience\neasily by one-hundred-fold. Many of these extend back before\n\u201ccomputational neuroscience\u201d was a recognized research\nendeavor.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen one example, the vector transformation\naccount of neural representation and computation, once under active\ndevelopment in cognitive neuroscience (see\n section 2 above).\n Other approaches using \u201ccognitivist\u201d resources were, and\ncontinue to be,\n pursued.[16]\n Some of these projects draw upon \u201ccognitivist\u201d\ncharacterizations of the phenomena to be explained. Some exploit\n\u201ccognitivist\u201d experimental techniques and methodologies.\nSome even attempt to derive \u201ccognitivist\u201d explanations\nfrom cell-biological processes (e.g., Hawkins and Kandel 1984). As\nStephen Kosslyn (1997) put it, cognitive neuroscientists employ the\n\u201cinformation processing\u201d view of the mind characteristic\nof cognitivism without trying to separate it from theories of brain\nmechanisms. Such an endeavor calls for an interdisciplinary community\nwilling to communicate the relevant portions of the mountain of detail\ngathered in individual disciplines with interested nonspecialists.\nThis requires more than people willing to confer with others working\nat related levels, but also researchers trained explicitly in the\nmethods and factual details of a variety of disciplines. This is a\ndaunting need, but it offers hope to philosophers wishing to\ncontribute to actual neuroscience. Thinkers trained in both the\n\u201csynoptic vision\u201d afforded by philosophy, and the\nscientific and experimental basis of a genuine (graduate-level)\nscience would be ideally equipped for this task. Recognition of this\npotential niche was slow to dawn on graduate programs in philosophy,\nbut a few programs have taken steps to fill it (see, e.g.,\n Other Internet Resources\n below).\n\nHowever, one glaring shortcoming remains. Given philosophers\u2019\ntraining and interests, \u201chigher-level\u201d\nneurosciences\u2014networks, cognitive, systems, and the fields of\ncomputational neuroscience which ally with these\u2014tend to attract\nthe most philosophical attention. As natural as this focus might be,\nit can lead philosophers to a misleading picture of neuroscience.\nNeurobiology remains focused on cellular and molecular mechanisms of\nneuronal activity, and allies with the kind of behavioral neuroscience\nthat works with animal models. This is still how a majority of members\nof the Society for Neuroscience, now more than 37,000 members strong,\nclassify their own research; this is where the majority of grant money\nfor research goes; and these are the areas whose experimental\npublications most often appear in the most highly cited scientific\njournals. (The link to the Society for Neuroscience\u2019s web site\nin\n Other Internet Resources below\n leads to a wealth of data on these numbers; see especially the\nPublications section.) Yet philosophers have tended not to pay much\nattention to cellular and molecular neuroscience. Fortunately this\nseems to be changing, as we will document in sections 7 and 8 below.\nStill, the preponderant attention philosophers pay to\ncognitive/systems/computational neuroscience obscures the wetlab\nexperiment-driven focus of ongoing neurobiology.\n",
