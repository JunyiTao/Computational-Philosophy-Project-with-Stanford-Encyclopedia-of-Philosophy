    "main_text": "Aristotle's Treatment of Mathematical Objects || Objects From Abstraction or \u2018Removal\u2019 (ta ex aphairese\u00f4s)\n7.1 Objects From Abstraction or \u2018Removal\u2019 (ta ex aphairese\u00f4s)\n\n\nAristotle occasionally refers to mathematical objects as things by,\nin, from, or through removal (in different works Aristotle uses\ndifferent expressions: ta aphairesei, ta en\naphairesei, ta ex aphairese\u00f4s, ta di\u2019\naphairese\u00f4s). It is also clear that this usage relates to\nlogical discussions in the Topics of definitions where one can\nspeak of adding a term or deleting a term from an expression and seeing\nwhat one gets as a result. Our principal task is to explain what this\nlogical/psychological removal is and how it solves the four puzzles.\nAristotle starts with the class of perceptible or physical\nmagnitudes. The examination of these is a part of physics (cf.\nPhysics iii.4). The ontological status of these does not\nconcern him, but we may suppose that they consitute the category of\nquantities: the bodies, surfaces, edges, corners, places, and times,\nsounds, etc. of physical substances (Categories 6).\n\n\nIn the Analytics, where the notion of matter is absent,\nAristotle begins with a particular geometrical perceptible figure. What\nis removed is its particularity and all that comes with this, including\nits being perceptible. What is left then is a universal of some sort.\nAristotle also does not seem to think in this work that there is any\nconflict between the plurality problem and thinking of all terms in a\nmathematical deduction as universals. However, since he allows that a\nterm can be a very complex expression, it can designate a rich complex\nfor which there would probably be no corresponding Form in a Platonic\ntheory.\n\n\nElsewhere, Aristotle usually seems to mean that the attributes not a\npart of the science are removed. What is left may be particular, a\nquasi-fictional entity. It is the status of this entity which leads to\nmuch controversy. Is it a representation in the soul or is it the\nperceptible object treated in a special way? Ancient and medieval\nreaders tended to take the former approach in their interpretation of\nAristotle, that the object left is a stripped down representation with\nonly the required properties. (Cf. Mueller (1990) and neo-Platonic\nfoundations for these interpretations of mathematics, such as Proclus\nin his commentary on Euclid.)\n\n\nMost modern readers, perhaps influenced by the critiques of Berkeley\nand Hume against the first position and certainly less committed to\nneo-Platonism, take the second approach. The objects studied by\nmathematical sciences are perceptible objects treated in a special\nway, as a perceived representation, whether as a diagram in the sand\nor an image in the imagination. Furthermore, perhaps as a response to\nFrege's devastating critique of psychologism and Husserl's first\nattempt at a psychological account of arithmetic, some have suggested\nthat Aristotle has no need for a special faculty of\nabstracting. Rather the mind is able to consider the perceived object\nwithout some of its properties, such as being perceived, being made of\nsand, marble, bronze, etc. However, this is analogous to the logical\nmanipulation of definitions, by considering terms with or without\ncertain additions. Hence, Aristotle will sometimes call the material\nobject, the mathematical object by adding on. As a convenience, the\nmind conceives of this as if the object were just that. On this view,\nabstraction is no more and no less psychological than inference.\n\n\nConceptually, we might think of the process as the mind rearranging\nthe ontological structure of the object. As a substantial artifact,\nwhat-it-is, the sand box has certain properties essentially. The figure\ndrawn may be incidental to what-it-is, i.e., an accident. In treating\nthe object as the figure drawn, being made of sand is incidental to it.\nHence, \u2018things by removal\u2019 may be one way of explaining\nperceptible magnitudes qua lengths. This is the concept which\ndoes most of the work for Aristotle.\n",
