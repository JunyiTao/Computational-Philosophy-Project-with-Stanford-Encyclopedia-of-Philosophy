The Mohists\u2019 explanation of being\n\u201cof a kind\u201d\u2014\u201chaving a respect in which\nthey\u2019re the same\u201d\u2014might at first glance seem to allow\nthat any group of things with anything in common could be considered a\nkind. Could the collection of items in your desk drawer then\nconstitute a kind by virtue of their similarity in being in the\ndrawer? A view that allows an affirmative answer might make\nidentification of kinds highly arbitrary, leading to an extreme\nrelativist or conventionalist view on which almost any group of things\ncould count as a kind. However, the Mohists would probably reject such\nan extreme view. A collection of things in a drawer might be\n\u201cthe same\u201d in being united, or grouped together, the third of the four types of\nsameness above, but presumably it would not be \u201cthe same\u201d in being\n\u201cof a kind.\u201d Rather, the Mohists seem to hold that to be\nof the same kind, things must possess one or more shared, intrinsically\nsimilar features, such as their visible characteristics (m\u00e0o \u8c8c)\nor shape (x\u00edng \u5f62) (Robins 2012). Nevertheless, since there\nare indefinitely many respects in which things might have similar\nobservable features, the Mohist stance could still be quite liberal,\nallowing things to be divided up into various kind distinctions\ndepending on which features a speech community happens to attend to. \n\nThe Mohists specify three sorts of general criteria for naming things,\nas we mentioned briefly in the section on\n language. (There may originally have been\nfurther criteria, as only a series of fragments remain of the text or\ntexts that treated these issues.) Some general names refer to objects that share the same \u201cshape and looks\u201d (x\u00edng\nm\u00e0o \u5f62\u8c8c, visible form and observable\nfeatures). Examples include mountains, hills, houses,\nshrines, swords, humans, and parts of the body (NO1\u20132, 7).\nSuch names are likely regarded as denoting kinds, since their use is based on features regarded as intrinsically similar. Other general names distinguish things on the basis of \u201cresidence and\nmigration\u201d (j\u016b y\u00f9n \u5c45\u904b). These\ninclude anything named after a place, such as a Qin horse, or anything\nlocated in a place. Instead of picking out things that count as kinds in the sense of sharing some intrinsic similarity, this criterion seems to identify things that are \u201cthe same\u201d by virtue of being \u201cunited\u201d in some way, such as by being in the same location. A third set of criteria are \u201camount and\nnumber\u201d (li\u00e0ng sh\u00f9 \u91cf\u6578)\n(NO2). Perhaps an example of a kind based on such criteria\nmight be \u201cquadruped.\u201d\n\nThese general criteria are hardly enough to resolve all of our\nquestions about the basis for kind distinctions, however. Kinds are\ndiscriminated from other things by citing or\n \u201cpresenting\u201d\n (j\u01d4 \u8209) distinctive features shared by their members. These features must be selected carefully. If we\nchoose features that are not genuinely relevant or comparable, then\nthe distinctions we draw will be specious (B76). If we cite features\nshared by individuals of more than one kind, we will fail to\ndistinguish the kinds correctly and reliably. The Mohists call the use\nof such specious or unreliable criteria \u201cwild\npresenting\u201d (ku\u00e1ng j\u01d4 \u72c2\u8209,\nciting features \u201ccrazily\u201d or \u201carbitrarily\u201d).\nAs canon B66 explains, we cannot recognize the differences between\nkinds of things correctly if we cite features that different kinds\nboth have (as oxen and horses both have teeth and tails) or features\nthat only some but not all of one kind have (as some but not all\ncattle have horns). \n\nThe specific issue framed in B66 is how, assuming that oxen and horses\nare indeed different kinds, we can specify distinguishing features to\ndifferentiate them\n reliably.[17]\n But the Mohists\u2019 rejection of \u201cwild\npresenting\u201d raises a more general issue. What determines the\ndistinctions between kinds, such that citing some features is\n\u201cwild\u201d and others not? Instead of distinguishing oxen\nfrom horses, could we instead group hornless oxen and horses together\nas a kind? The Mohists\u2019 implicit view seems to be\u2014though\nthe textual evidence is sparse and open to competing\ninterpretations\u2014that the difference between kinds such as oxen\nand horses lies in distinctive similarities shared by members of each\nkind that are inherent in their sh\u00ed \u5be6 (stuff),\nobtaining independently of human activity. Hence kind relations are determined by the\nnatural world, not by human attitudes or conventions. Which kind\ndistinctions we attend to and employ may be up to us, but that some\ngroup of things forms a kind is not. In seeking to distinguish kinds,\nthen, our task is to identify features that allow us to recognize the\ninherent differences between them reliably.\n\nThis view seems implied by canon B1, which depicts two parties to a\ndebate discussing how to \u201csettle\u201d (zh\u01d0\n\u6b62) what kind (l\u00e8i \u985e) they are referring\nto by considering in turn whether the presence or absence of various\nfeatures in one or more individual exemplars generalizes to the entire\nkind. The scenario depicted seems to presuppose that the particular\nexemplar (a horse, suppose) is inherently a member of a predetermined\nkind (horses). (This implicit assumption is reflected in the\ntext\u2019s referring to the exemplar as \u201cthis/these\nhere\u201d [c\u01d0 \u6b64] and to the kind it is\nunderstood to belong to as \u201cthis (kind)\u201d\n[sh\u00ec \u662f].) The debaters\u2019 task is not to\nagree on features by which to establish or institute the kind, but to\nfind features that reliably distinguish a collection of inherently\nsimilar things from other, non-similar things. They cannot simply\nstipulate what the features of the kind will be, just as they cannot\nsimply stipulate that oxen are distinguished from horses by having\nhorns. The similarity relation between the exemplar horse and other\nhorses that constitutes being \u201cof a kind\u201d is intrinsic to them and does not depend on our deeming them similar. Hence it seems\nappropriate to characterize the Mohist stance as \u201crealist,\u201d specifically in the sense that the \u201csameness\u201d relations that determine kinds are inherent in things and not a product of human attitudes or practices.\n\n\nThis implicitly realist view of similarity relations and kind\ndistinctions seems operative as well in canon B2, which indicates that\nwe can be mistaken in how we project kind relations, since features of\nindividual exemplars may not generalise to all members of their kind.\nThe canon again seems to assume that the kind relation between an\nexemplar and others of its kind exists independently of our\nidentifying it, and so questions can arise as to whether we are\nextending kinds properly. If kind relations were not independent in\nthis way, the features by which we distinguish and name the exemplar\ncould simply define what features are \u201cso\u201d of the kind.\n\n\nOn this line of interpretation, then, we find the Mohists contending\nin canons B8 and B72 that although we can \u201cborrow\u201d the\nname of one kind and use it of another thing\u2014their examples are\nthat we might name a dog \u201cCrane\u201d or a family might be\nsurnamed \u201cCrane\u201d\u2014it is impermissible to claim things\njust are whatever we call them. The dog is not actually a water bird.\nWhether or not something is the sort of thing designated by a name is\ndetermined not by our happening to deem it so, but by whether it is in fact\nrelevantly similar to other things that take that name. \nGeneral terms must \u201cproceed\u201d (x\u00edng \u884c), or be projectible to, their extensions in regular, predictable ways. Names of kinds must \u201cproceed\u201d on the basis of inherent similarities. \nCanon B72 is\nin effect attacking the stance, associated with the\n \u201cSchool of Names\u201d\n and discussed in certain Zhuangzi passages, that anything\ncan arbitrarily be deemed \u201cso\u201d with respect to some\n kind.[18]\n\n\nThe issues at stake here matter not only for the Mohists. They are\namong the central questions in classical Chinese philosophy, addressed\nin different ways by Mohists, Daoists, Confucians, and others. For\nwhat scheme of kind distinctions we adopt was seen as determining\nvalues, norms of action, and even the organization of society. In the\nWestern tradition, views on similar issues have tended to fall into\none of three general categories: realism, conceptualism, or\n nominalism.[19]\n This taxonomy is unhelpful in understanding classical Chinese\nthought, however, for the various positions in the Chinese discourse\nall tend to fall roughly under the label of nominalism, appealing\nneither to universals nor to concepts to explain the relation between\na thing and its kind. The range of Chinese positions can more usefully\nbe plotted along a spectrum from a form of realism to various forms of\nconventionalism or\n relativism,[20]\n representing the extent to which they treat distinctions between\nkinds as fixed and independent of human activity, on the one hand, or\nas relative to our (potentially plural and variable) attitudes,\npractices, context, or point of view, on the other. On one end of this\nspectrum would be monistic realism, the view that kind distinctions\nare determined by a single, uniquely correct pattern of similarity\nrelations fixed by the world itself, such that exactly one set of kind\ndistinctions are the correct ones. Next might come a weaker form of\nrealism, on which kind distinctions rest on similarity relations fixed\nby the world, but different speech communities might employ kind names\nthat pick out some or other of these distinctions depending on their\ninterests or customs. Further in the relativist direction would be\n Xunzi\u2019s\n pragmatic conventionalism, which holds that the similarity relations\nthat underwrite kind distinctions are not inherent in things\nthemselves but are determined by social conventions based on our\nnatural biological disposition to classify certain things similarly,\nour cultural traditions, political decisions, and practical efficacy\nin securing socioeconomic order. Still further in the relativist\ndirection would be the positions of the \u201cDiscourse on Evening\nThings Out\u201d and \u201cAutumn Waters\u201d essays in the\n Zhuangzi,\n both of which hold that, though the schemes of kind distinctions we\nemploy are grounded in similarities between things, these similarities\nthemselves are determined by our perspective, practices, or context.\nAt the extreme relativist end of the spectrum would be the view that\nkind distinctions are entirely arbitrary, fixed only by the contingent\nwhims of the person doing the classifying. It is unclear whether any\nearly Chinese thinker actually held such a view, though ideas\nassociated with\n Hui Shi\n and\n Gongsun Long\n suggest that they might have. \n\nThe later Mohists most likely fall on the realist side of\nthis spectrum, although their account of the grounds for kind distinctions is so sketchy that any interpretation of their position is partly conjectural. Their stance seems to be that whether we recognize some kind by dubbing its exemplars with a name\u2014as when we dub horses\n\u201chorse\u201d\u2014is determined by our practices, but that whether a group of objects, such as horses, form a kind is determined by whether the objects are intrinsically similar, independently of our practices (A78, A86). \n\n\nThe texts do not clearly indicate whether, for example, the aggregate oxen-and-horses\u2014that\nis, draft animals\u2014could conventionally be deemed a kind (cf. B67).\nPerhaps the Mohists would instead hold that, as draft animals, oxen and horses are \u201cthe same\u201d in being \u201cunited\u201d by their function in pulling carts (that is, by the third of the four types of \u201csameness\u201d). Canon B66 seems to imply that hornless oxen and horses cannot form a kind, probably because no feature distinguishes just this grouping of hornless animals from all others. By contrast, perhaps hornless quadrupeds could constitute a kind, because their inherent similarity in having four legs but lacking horns distinguishes them from all other creatures. In the end, later Mohist texts offer no explicit, detailed explanation of exactly which similarities between things constitute the basis for kinds. On this point, their treatment contrasts with that of, for example, Xunzi, who clearly indicates that the relevant \u201csamenesses\u201d are constituted through social practices. [21]\n\n",
