Issues\n\nEuclid defined a boundary as \u201cthat which is an extremity of\nanything\u201d (Elements, I, def. 13). Aristotle defined the\nextremity of a thing as \u201cthe first thing beyond which it is not\npossible to find any part [of the given thing], and the first within\nwhich every part is\u201d (Metaphysics, V, 1022a4\u20135).\nTogether, these two definitions deliver the classic account of\nboundaries, an account that is both intuitive and comprehensive and\noffers the natural starting point for any further investigation into\nthe boundary concept. Indeed, although Aristotle\u2019s definition\nconcerned primarily the extremities of spatial entities, it applies\nequally well in the temporal domain. Just as the Mason-Dixon line\nmarks the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania insofar as no\npart of Maryland can be found on the northern side of the line, and no\npart of Pennsylvania on its southern side, so \u201cthe now is an\nextremity of the past (no part of the future being on this side of\nit), and again of the future (no part of the past being on that side\nof it)\u201d (Physics, VI, 233b35\u2013234a2). Similarly\nfor concrete objects and events: just as the surface of an apple marks\nits spatial boundary insofar as the apple extends only up to it, so\nthe referee\u2019s whistle marks the temporal boundary of the game\ninsofar as the game protracts only up to it. In the case of abstract\nentities, such as concepts and sets, the account is perhaps adequate\nonly figuratively. Still, it is telling that one of the Greek words\nfor \u2018boundary\u2019, \u1f45\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, is also a\nword for \u2018definition\u2019: as John of Damascus nicely put it,\n\u201cdefinition is the term for the setting of land boundaries taken\nin a metaphorical sense\u201d (The Fount of Knowledge, I,\n8). Likewise, it is telling that in point-set topology the standard\ndefinition of a set\u2019s boundary (from Hausdorff 1914, \u00a77.2)\nreflects essentially the same intuition: the boundary, or frontier, of\na set A is the set of those points all of whose neighborhoods\nintersect both A and the complement of A (where a\nneighborhood of a point p is, intuitively, a set of points\nthat entirely \u201csurround\u201d p). It is not an\nexaggeration, therefore, to say that the Euclidean-Aristotelian\ncharacterization captures a general intuition about boundaries that\napplies across the board. Nonetheless, precisely this intuitive\ncharacterization gives rise to several puzzles that justify\nphilosophical concern.\n1.1 Owned vs. Unowned Boundaries\n\nThe first sort of puzzle relates to the intuition that a boundary\nseparates two entities, or two parts of the same entity,\nwhich are then said to be in contact with each other.\nFollowing Smith (1997a: 534), imagine ourselves traveling from\nMaryland to Pennsylvania. What happens as we cross the Mason-Dixon\nline? Do we pass through a last point p in Maryland and a\nfirst point q in Pennsylvania? Clearly not, given the density\nof the continuum. As Aristotle put it, no two points can lie \u201cin\nsuccession\u201d to each other (Physics, VI, 231b6\u20139),\nso we should have to countenance an infinite number of further points\nbetween p and q, hence between the two States,\ncontrary to their being in contact. But, equally clearly, we can\nhardly acknowledge the existence of just one of p and\nq, as is dictated by the standard mathematical treatment of\nthe continuum (Dedekind 1872); either choice would amount to a\npeculiar privileging of one State over the other, an unacceptably\narbitrary asymmetry. And it would seem that we cannot identify\np with q, either, for we are speaking of two\nadjacent States; their territories cannot have any parts in\ncommon, not even pointy parts. So, where is the Mason-Dixon\nline, and how does it relate to the two adjacent entities it\nseparates?\n\nThe puzzle can be generalized. Consider the dilemma raised by Leonardo\nda Vinci in his Notebooks (1938: 75\u201376): What is it\nthat divides the atmosphere from the water? Is it air or is it water?\nOr consider Su\u00e1rez\u2019s worry in the Disputations\n(40, V, \u00a758), repeatedly echoed by Peirce (1892: 546; 1893:\n7.127): What color is the line of demarcation between a black spot and\nits white background? Perhaps figure/ground considerations could be\ninvoked to provide an answer in this second case, based on the\nprinciple that the boundary is always owned by the figure \u2014 the\nbackground is topologically \u201copen\u201d (Jackendoff 1987, App.\nB). But what is figure and what is ground when it comes to two\nadjacent halves of the same black spot? What is figure and what is\nground when it comes to Maryland and Pennsylvania? What happens when a\nseabird dives into the water? Indeed, it would be natural to suppose\nthat all entities of the same sort behave alike \u2014 for instance,\nthat all material bodies be figure-like entities, each possessing its\nown boundary. But then, how could any two of them ever be or\ncome in contact, short of penetrability? (In this last form,\nthe question goes back to Sextus Empiricus, Against the\nPhysicists, I, 258\u2013266, and is widely discussed in recent\nliterature; see e.g. Kline and Matheson 1987, Godfrey 1990, Hazen\n1990, Zimmerman 1996b, Lange 2002, \u00a71.3, Hudson 2005, \u00a73.1,\nKilborn 2007, Sherry 2015.)\n\nConsider also Plato\u2019s classical version of the puzzle in regard\nto temporal boundaries (Parmenides, 156c\u2013e): When an\nobject starts moving, or a moving object comes to rest, is it in\nmotion or is it at rest? As Aristotle later put it, the question\narises precisely because \u201cthe now that is the extremity of both\ntimes must be one and the same\u201d, for again, \u201cif each\nextremity were different, the one could not be in succession to the\nother\u201d (Physics, VI, 234a5\u20136). Of course, one\ncould maintain that there is no motion at an instant, but\nonly during an interval, as Aristotle himself held\n(231b18\u2013232a18, 234a24\u2013b9). Yet the question remains: Does\nthe transitional moment belong to the motion interval or to the rest\ninterval? (On this version of the puzzle, see Medlin 1963, Hamblin\n1969, Strang 1974, Kretzmann 1976, Sorabji and Kretzmann 1976, Sorabji\n1983, ch. 26, Mortensen 1985.)\n\nBesides, the problem is not specific to the transition between motion\nand rest and admits of several variants that would seem to resist\nAristotle\u2019s solution. Gellius, for instance, tells us that the\nMiddle Platonists were much concerned with the parallel question of\nwhether a dying person dies when they are already in the grasp of\ndeath or while they still live (Noctes Atticae, VI, xiii,\n5\u20136). This was thought to be a genuine insolubilis,\nshort of conceding the absurdity that no one ever dies (Sextus\nEmpiricus, Against the Physicists, I, 269), and the same\ncould be said of the many variants discussed by later Platonists and\nby medieval and modern philosophers (see Strobach 1998 and Goubier and\nRoques 2018). Deep down, the puzzle is no less than a primary\nillustration of the paradoxical nature of instantaneous change (about\nwhich see the entry on\n change and inconsistency).\n1.2 Natural vs. Artificial Boundaries\n\nA second sort of puzzle relates to the fact that Aristotle\u2019s\nmereological (parthood-based) definition, and the common-sense\nintuition that it captures, seem to apply only to the realm of\ncontinuous entities. Modulo the above-mentioned difficulty, the\nthought that Maryland and Pennsylvania are bounded by the Mason-Dixon\nline is fair enough. But ordinary material objects \u2014 it might be\nobserved \u2014 are not truly continuous and speaking of an\nobject\u2019s boundary is like speaking of the \u201cflat top\u201d\nof a fakir\u2019s bed of nails (Simons 1991: 91). On closer\ninspection, the spatial boundaries of physical objects are imaginary\nentities surrounding swarms of subatomic particles, and their exact\nshape and location involve the same degree of idealization of a\ndrawing obtained by \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d, the same degree\nof arbitrariness as any mathematical graph smoothed out of scattered\nand inexact data, the same degree of abstraction as the figures\u2019\ncontours in a Seurat painting. Similarly, on closer inspection a\nbody\u2019s being in motion amounts to the fact that the vector sum\nof the motions of zillions of restless particles, averaged over time,\nis non-zero, hence it makes no sense to speak of the instant\nat which a body stops moving (Galton 1994: 4). All this may be seen as\ngood news vis-\u00e0-vis the generalized puzzles of Section\n1.1, which would not even get off the ground (at least in the form\ngiven above; see Smith 2007 and Wilson 2008 for qualifications). But\nthen the question arises: Is our boundary talk a mere fa\u00e7on\nde parler? Even with reference to the Mason-Dixon line \u2014\nand, more generally, those boundaries that demarcate adjacent parts of\na continuous manifold, as when an individual cognitive agent\nconceptualizes a black spot as being made of two halves \u2014 one\ncan raise the question of their ontological status. Such boundaries\nare puzzling; but are they real? After all, they stem\nentirely from our social practices and from the organizing activity of\nour intellect. It might be argued, therefore, that belief in their\nobjectivity epitomizes a form of metaphysical realism that cries for\njustification. Do such boundaries really exist?\n\nWe may, in this connection, introduce a conceptual distinction between\n\u201cnatural\u201d or bona fide boundaries, which would be\nobjective insofar as they are grounded in some physical discontinuity\nor qualitative heterogeneity betwixt an entity and its surroundings,\nand \u201cartificial\u201d or fiat boundaries, which are\nnot so grounded in the autonomous, mind-independent world (Smith 1995,\nbuilding on Curzon 1907). The coastline of Britain, or the boundary\nseparating a black spot from its white background, might be examples\nof the former, but geopolitical boundaries such as the Mason-Dixon\nline, or the boundary between the top and the bottom halves of the\nblack spot, are clearly of the latter sort. Moreover, just as\nfiat boundaries may be involved in the partitioning of larger\nwholes into proper parts, so they are often at work when we\ncircumclude a number of smaller entities into larger wholes: think of\nBenelux or Polynesia, but also of the easiness with which we represent\nthe world as consisting of forests, swarms of bees, constellations, or\nwhen we group our actions into baseball games, electoral campaigns,\nwars, etc. (Smith 1999b). Now, insofar as they are not truly\ncontinuous, even the surfaces of ordinary material objects \u2014\nhence the boundaries of the individual trees, the individual bees, the\nindividual stars \u2014 may be said to involve fiat\ndemarcations of just the same sort. (Cf. Goodman: \u201cWe make a\nstar as we make a constellation, by putting its parts together and\nmarking off its boundaries\u201d; 1980: 213.) On closer inspection,\neven the boundaries of our individual actions may be seen in this\nlight, indeed even a person\u2019s birth and death may to some extent\nreflect conventional decisions and stipulations, witness the\ncontroversies on abortion and euthanasia (see the entries on\n life\n and\n the definition of death).\n On closer inspection, even the extolled coastline of Britain is to\nsome extent fixed by us, witness the proverbial elusiveness of its\nobjective length and location (Mandelbrot 1967). So the question\narises: are there any natural, mind-independent, genuine\nbona fide boundaries? The natural/artificial distinction is\nintuitively clear; but how robust is it? Are there any concepts that\ntruly carve the world \u201cat the joints\u201d, as per\nPlato\u2019s butchering guidelines (Phaedrus, 265e)? And, if\nnot, is the fiat nature of our boundary talk a reason to\njustify an anti-realist attitude towards boundaries altogether?\n\nThe question has deep ramifications. For once the fiat/bona\nfide opposition has been recognized, it is clear that it can be\ndrawn not merely in relation to boundaries, but also in relation to\nthose entities that may be said to have boundaries (Smith and\nVarzi 2000; Smith 2001, 2019; Tahko 2012; Davies 2019). If (part of)\ntheir boundaries are artificial \u2014 if they reflect the\narticulation of reality that is effected through human cognition and\nsocial practices \u2014 then those entities themselves may be viewed\nas conceptual constructions, a product of our worldmaking, hence the\nquestion of the ontological status of fiat boundaries becomes\nof a piece with the more general issue of the conventional status of\nordinary objects and events. This is not to imply that we end up with\nimaginary or otherwise unreal wholes: as Frege wrote, the objectivity\nof the North Sea \u201cis not affected by the fact that it is a\nmatter of our arbitrary choice which part of all the water on the\nearth\u2019s surface we mark off and elect to call the \u2018North\nSea\u2019\u201d (1884, \u00a726). Or as James wrote, echoing\nMichelangelo: \u201cThe mind works on the data it receives very much\nas a sculptor works on his block of stone; in a sense the statue stood\nthere from eternity\u201d (1890: I/188). It does, however, follow\nthat the entities in question would only enjoy an individuality as a\nresult of our selective strokes: their objectivity is independent of\nus, but their individuality \u2014 their being the sorts of thing\nthey are, perhaps even their having the identity and persistence\nconditions they have \u2014 would depend on our choices and our\nidentification and reidentification criteria (Sidelle 1989; Heller\n1990; Zerubavel 1991; Jubien 1993; Varzi 2011, 2016; Azzouni 2017;\nPiras 2020).\n\nThese ramifications go well beyond the concerns of metaphysics; they\nextend across the board, especially insofar as we have a tendency to\ncall \u201cnatural\u201d exactly those boundaries that best suit our\nparochial interests. In the geopolitical domain, for instance, the\nrhetoric with which certain frontiers have been claimed to be\ndrawn by the hand of Nature, if not by the hand of God, has been\nresponsible for some of the most tragic vicissitudes in our history,\nas even Lord Curzon \u2014 the epitome of British imperialism \u2014\nrecognized (1907: 54). There is by now a large body of literature on\nthis topic, stemming mostly from the classic works of Reclus\n(1905\u20131908), Febvre (1922), and Ancel (1938) (see Broek 1941\nand, for recent overviews, Rankin and Schofield 2004 and Fall 2010).\nBut similar considerations apply to all sorts of atrocities that we\ncommitted and continue to commit in all sorts of domains. That\nrhetoric is at work every time we invoke Plato\u2019s carving\nguidelines fraudulently and surreptitiously, every time we stigmatize\nas a \u201cbad butcher\u201d whoever holds views or follows\npractices that don\u2019t match our own as though they were\n\u201cagainst nature\u201d. This does not mean that the guidelines\nthemselves are corrupt; the realist is still free to take them\nseriously, if cautiously. But is there any viable way to implement\nthem irrespective of our ideological, cultural, and individual biases?\nWe can hardly be wrong in attributing fiat status to a\nboundary that is manifestly drawn by us; but who can vet the\nobjectivity of a natural joint? Recent work in feminist metaphysics\nand epistemology and in the philosophy and sociology of race has\nbrought these issues to the fore (see the entries on\n feminist metaphysics,\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n race,\n and the\n critical philosophy of race).\n No theory of boundaries can ignore them. \n1.3 Sharp vs. Fuzzy Boundaries\n\nA third worry relates to vagueness. Aristotle\u2019s definition (as\nwell as standard topology) suggests that there is always a sharp\ndemarcation between the inside (interior) and the outside (exterior)\nof a thing. Yet it may be observed that ordinary objects and events,\nas well as the extensions of many ordinary concepts, may have\nboundaries that are in some sense fuzzy or indeterminate. Clouds,\ndeserts, mountains, let alone the figures of an impressionist\npainting, all seem to elude the idealized notion of a sharply bounded\nentity. Likewise, the temporal boundaries of many events, let alone\ntheir spatial boundaries, seem to be indeterminate. When exactly did\nthe industrial revolution begin? When did it end? Where did it take\nplace? And certainly the concepts corresponding to many ordinary\npredicates, such as \u2018bald\u2019 or \u2018heap\u2019, do not\npossess definite boundaries, either. As again Frege famously put it,\nto such concepts there seems to correspond \u201can area that ha[s]\nnot a sharp boundary-line all around, but in places just vaguely\nfade[s] away into the background\u201d (1903: \u00a756). How is such\nfuzziness to be construed?\n\nOne radical option would be to dismiss the question altogether.\nWittgenstein, for instance, urged that \u201can indefinite boundary\nis not really a boundary at all\u201d (1953: 45e). Or one might as\nwell insist that the issue is purely epistemic: the fuzziness would\nlie exclusively in our ignorance about the exact location of the\nrelevant boundaries, which in themselves would be perfectly sharp\n(Sorensen 1988; Williamson 1994). When taken at face value, however,\nthe question is highly controversial. One may distinguish broadly\nbetween de re accounts and de dicto accounts. On a\nde re account, the fuzziness is truly ontological. Thus,\npace Evans (1978), the boundary of, say, Mount Everest would\nbe fuzzy insofar as there is no objective, determinate fact of the\nmatter about which parcels of land lie on which side (Tye 1990;\nCopeland 1995; Morreau 2002; Hyde 2008). Similarly, a predicate such\nas \u2018bald\u2019 would be vague because it stands for a vague\nset, a set with a truly fuzzy boundary (Zadeh 1965; Goguen 1969). It\nis an open question, then, whether such boundary fuzziness would\nentail a corresponding indeterminacy in the identity conditions of the\nrelevant bounded entities (see e.g. Noonan 2008 vs. Paganini 2017),\njust as it may be an open question whether it would entail an\nobjective indeterminacy in the existence conditions of certain (other)\nentities, say, the mereological difference between Everest and the sum\nof its definite parts (see e.g. Hawley 2002 and Donnelly 2009). By\ncontrast, a de dicto account would correspond to a purely\nlinguistic or conceptual notion of vagueness. There is no fuzzy\nboundary demarcating Mount Everest on this view; rather, there are\nmany distinct parcels of land, each with a precise border and precise\nexistence and identity conditions, but our linguistic practices have\nnot enforced a choice of any one of them as the official referent of\nthe term \u2018Mount Everest\u2019 (Mehlberg 1958; Lewis 1986; McGee\n1997). Similarly, on this view there is no such thing as a vaguely\ndemarcated set of bald people; rather, our linguistic stipulations do\nnot precisely specify which set of people, among the many that exist,\ncorresponds to the extension of \u2018bald\u2019 (Fine 1975; Keefe\n2000).\n\nWhether the fuzziness of a given boundary should be construed de\nre or de dicto may be a case-by-case matter. No one\nthinks that all indeterminacy is a matter of worldly unsettledness,\nand the contrary claim, to the effect that boundary indeterminacy is\nalways the product of semantic or representational imprecision, is\nhighly contentious despite its distinguished pedigree (Russell 1923).\nMoreover, there is room for a middle third-way, according to which\nthere is genuine ontological indeterminacy, but it doesn\u2019t lie\nin the boundaries themselves; it would lie, rather, in the\ndeterminable/determinate structure of boundary properties (Wilson\n20123), or in the fact that it is ontically indeterminate which\nprecise boundaries things have (Akiba 2004; Barnes 2010; Abasnezhad\nand Hosseini 2014). Generally speaking, however, it would seem that\nthe de re/de dicto alternative aligns rather closely with the\nbona fide/fiat opposition. With fuzzy boundaries of the\nfiat sort, a de dicto account suggests itself\nnaturally: insofar as the process leading to the definition of a\nboundary may not be precise, the question of whether something lies\ninside or outside the boundary may be semantically indeterminate. On\nthe other hand, this account does not sit well with boundaries of the\nbona fide sort. If any such boundary were fuzzy, it would be\nso independently of our cognitive or social articulations, hence a\nde re account would seem inevitable; the fuzziness of the\nboundary would lie in the way the world is (or isn\u2019t). Thus, it\nwould appear that a boundary may suffer from de dicto\nfuzziness if and only if it is of the fiat sort, and from\nde re fuzziness if and only if it is of the bona\nfide sort.\n\nEither way, making room for fuzzy boundaries will open the door to the\nmany difficulties that arise whenever vagueness phenomena are taken at\nface value. In particular, both de re and de dicto\naccounts will have to deal with the challenge of providing a way out\nof the sorites paradox: how can we ever cross a fuzzy boundary, if no\nsingle step can make a difference? And both accounts will have to\nprovide a way of accommodating phenomena of higher order vagueness:\nnot only may it be indeterminate whether something lies on one side or\nthe other of a fuzzy boundary; it may also be indeterminate whether it\nis indeterminate whether it lies on one side or the other \u2014 and\nso on. (On these issues, see the entries on the\n Sorites paradox\n and\n vagueness.)\n Some authors think such challenges are insurmountable, and that\nde re and de dicto conceptions are equally\nmisguided. There would be no words or entities with fuzzy boundaries;\nwhenever we think there are, we are, rather, representing the world\nthrough concepts that are strictly speaking \u201cboundaryless\u201d\n(Sainsbury 1990).\n1.4 Bodiless vs. Bulky Boundaries\n\nA fourth source of concern relates to the intuition, implicit in\nAristotle\u2019s and Euclid\u2019s definitions, that boundaries are\nlower-dimensional entities, i.e., have at least one dimension fewer\nthan the entities they bound. The surface of a (continuous) sphere,\nfor example, is two-dimensional (it has no \u201csubstance\u201d or\n\u201cdivisible bulk\u201d), the Mason-Dixon Line is one-dimensional\n(it has \u201clength\u201d but no \u201cbreadth\u201d), and a\nboundary point such as the vertex of a cone is zero-dimensional (it\nextends in no direction). This intuition has become common currency in\ncontemporary philosophy through Johnson (1922: 168; 1924:\n163\u2013164) and is germane to much of what we ordinarily say about\nboundaries. Yet it is problematic insofar as it contrasts with several\nindependent intuitions that are of a piece with both common sense and\nphilosophical theorizing. For instance, there is a standing tradition\nin epistemology (from Moore 1925 to Jackson 1977 and Gibson 1979)\naccording to which boundaries play a crucial role in perception: we\nsee (opaque) physical objects indirectly by seeing their surfaces. Yet\nit is not clear how one could see a whole just by seeing part of it\n(Chisholm 1957; Clarke 1965), even less how one could literally\nsee parts that lack physical bulk altogether (Stroll 1986a,\n1986b). Likewise, we often speak of surfaces as of things that may be\npitted, or damp, or that can be scratched, polished, sanded, and so\non, and it is unclear whether such predicates can be applied at all to\nimmaterial entities. In such cases, it would rather seem that surfaces\n(and boundaries more generally; see Jackendoff 1991) are to be\nconstrued as \u201cthin layers\u201d that are schematized\nas having fewer dimensions than the wholes to which they apply. The\nsame sort of schematization is commonplace in the geopolitical domain,\nwhere the boundary lines that we find depicted in ordinary maps and\natlases may in fact correspond to border \u201cbelts\u201d, or\n\u201czones\u201d, of various kinds and widths (Prescott 1965). The\nvery fact that the geographic notion of a natural boundary is often\nillustrated with reference to rivers, ravines, mountain ranges, etc.\nis indicative of this tendency. As Ratzel famously put it: \u201cThe\nborder area is the reality, the border line the abstraction\nthereof\u201d (1897: 448).\n\nArguably, this conceptual tension between boundaries understood as\nlower-dimensional entities and boundaries understood as thin layers,\nor zones, reflects an irreducible ambiguity in ordinary speech (Stroll\n1977, 1979). And, arguably, it is only the first conception that gives\nrise to the puzzles outlined in the foregoing sections; bulky\nboundaries and border zones can be treated as ordinary, extended\nproper parts of the bodies and regions they bound. Yet a general\ntheory of boundaries should have something to say about the second\nconception as well \u2014 and more generally about the interaction\nbetween the mathematical idealization associated with the former\nconception and the physical, cognitive, and philosophical significance\nof the latter (Stroll 1988; Simons 1991; Galton 2007).\n\nThe issue also relates to the question of whether there can be\nextended mereological simples. The ancient atomists had no doubts,\nwith Democritus famously holding that the ultimate constituent of\nreality, while indivisible, come in an infinite variety\n\u201cdiffering in size and in shape\u201d (Aristotle,\nMetaphysics, III, 203b2). Today it is more common to assume\nthat the mereological structure of a thing always matches perfectly\nthat of its spatio-temporal receptacle (what Varzi 2007 calls\n\u201cmirroring\u201d and Uzquiano 2011 \u201charmony\u201d),\nwhich would imply the opposite answer. Nevertheless, in recent years\nseveral authors have rejected the assumption, seriously reviving the\nhypothesis of mereological simples that occupy extended regions of\nspace and/or time (see e.g. Markosian 1998, Parsons 2000, Simons 2004,\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, and McDaniel 2007 along with the\nentry on\n location and mereology).\n Insofar as the lower-dimensional nature of boundaries may be\nconstrued in terms of their being indivisible along one or\nmore dimensions, as opposed to unextended along those\ndimensions (a conception encouraged also by some medieval\nphilosophers, e.g. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t of Kit\u0101b\nal-\u0160if\u0101, II, ii, 4\u20136), such a view would suggest\nthat also a boundary\u2019s spatio-temporal extension may transcend\nits mereological structure; the boundary would lack divisible bulk,\nbut it might nonetheless possess divisible extent. A boundary point,\nfor instance, would be pointy in that it has no proper parts, though\nit could extend over a (small) one-dimensional, a two-dimensional, or\neven a three-dimensional region. Again, such extended boundaries would\nbe refreshingly unproblematic. As with their divisible bulky cousins,\none could easily explain how we can see them, for instance, or polish\nthem, scratch them, etc. However, they would also raise questions of\ntheir own. Above all: How would such boundaries connect to the things\nthey bound? Would there be a further, unextended boundary separating\nthe two (and matching the unextended boundary between the\ncorresponding receptacles)? In the case of boundaries with divisible\nbulk, the answer to the latter question is obviously in the\naffirmative. It is an open question, however, whether the same answer\nshould apply to extended indivisible boundaries.\n2. Theories\n\nSo boundaries are, on the one hand, central to the common-sense\npicture of the world and yet, on the other, deeply problematic. We may\naccordingly distinguish two main sorts of theories, depending on\nwhether one is willing to take the problems at face value (realist\ntheories) or to bypass them altogether, treating boundaries as\nfictional abstractions of some sort (non-realist theories).\n2.1 Realist Theories\n\nMost realist theories about boundaries, construed as lower-dimensional\nentities, share the view that such entities are ontological parasites:\npoints, lines, and surfaces cannot be separated and cannot exist in\nisolation from the entities they bound (pace Su\u00e1rez,\nwho thought that God would be capable of such marvels; see\nDisputation 40, V, \u00a741). This view does justice to the\nintuition that boundaries, if real, are somewhat \u201cless\nreal\u201d than the entities they bound, and as such it goes back to\nAristotle (Metaphysics, XI, 1060b12\u201316) and has been\ndefended e.g. by Boethius (Second Commentary I, xi,\n14\u201321), revived by Abelard (Glosses on Porphyry,\n8.1\u20134), and eventually backed up by Brentano (1976) and his\npupils, especially Husserl in his third Logical Investigation\n(1901). Of course, the notion of ontological dependence is itself open\nto several interpretations (see Koslicki 2014 and the entry on\n ontological dependence).\n In the case of boundaries, it is generally agreed that the relevant\nrelation is one of rigid existential dependence: if x is a\nboundary of y, then necessarily x exists only if\ny exists (Chisholm 1984, 1994). Realist theories may differ\nsignificantly, however, with regard to how such rigidly dependent,\nlower-dimensional entities relate to the extended entities they\nbound.\n\nTo illustrate, consider again the first puzzle of Section 1 (owned vs.\nunowned boundaries). Let A and B be any two extended\nentities separated by a common boundary, such as Maryland and\nPennsylvania. Then we may distinguish four main views (Varzi 1997;\nStrobach 1998, pt. II).\n\n(1) The boundary may belong neither to A\nnor to B. This was, ultimately, Leonardo\u2019s\nview (1938: 76) and is perhaps the least popular among recent\nphilosophers (though see e.g. Hestevold 1986 and Schmolze 1996). It\nimplies that contact may obtain between A and B even\nif both A and B are topologically open, so long as\nnothing lies between them except for their common, outer boundary\n\u2014 i.e., so long as the closure of A (A plus\nits boundary) overlaps the closure of B (B plus its\nboundary). So, on this view, there is no last point p of\nMaryland just as there is no first point q of Pennsylvania:\nthe States of the Union do not, strictly speaking, use up the whole\nterritory. In the temporal realm, the view is somewhat more popular\n(Sorensen 1986), for it may be seen as providing a quietist way out of\nthe transition puzzles mentioned in section 1.1. Cf. Epicurus:\n\u201cDeath is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, it is not\nwith us; but when death comes, then we do not exist\u201d (Letter\nto Menoeceus, 1926: 85). On the other hand, it is precisely on\nsuch grounds that some early modern Islamic philosophers, e.g.\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, argued that change of substantial\nnature can never be instantaneous and must therefore be\ngradual: insofar as it is impossible for there to be\n\u201cformless\u201d matter, there can never be an instant when\nsomething has lost the previous form and not yet gained the new one\n(Asf\u0101r, IV, 274).\n\n(2) The boundary belongs either to A\nor to B, though it may be indeterminate to which of\nA and B it belongs. This view builds on\nBolzano\u2019s classic analysis of the continuum (1851: \u00a766),\nwhich in turn is mirrored by the standard account of point-set\ntopology (see e.g. Kelley 1955). It implies that contact may obtain\nbetween A and B only when either A or\nB is topologically closed (i.e., contains its own boundary)\nin the relevant contact area while the other is topologically open,\nthough the appeal to indeterminacy allows one to leave the matter\nunsettled. This indeterminacy, in turn, may be construed as semantic\nor as epistemic, if not metaphysical, depending on whether the\nrelevant boundary is of the fiat sort, as with the\nMason-Dixon line, or of the bona fide sort. (Similarly in the\ntemporal realm; see e.g. Kamp 1980, Le Poidevin 2000, Pickup 2022.)\nAll of this can be explained without resorting to the machinery of\nabstract set theory; a mereotopological account, where the relevant\ntopological distinctions are elucidated in terms of the part-whole\nrelation, provides a viable alternative (Smith 1996; Casati and Varzi\n1999, Ch. 5; Varzi 2007, \u00a72.4.1) and can be suitably adjusted to\nfit even the most liberal views of spatio-temporal receptacles (Hudson\n2001). Nonetheless the view has its costs. From a naive perspective,\nthe distinction between open and (semi-)closed entities may seem\nunwarranted, if not \u201cmonstrous\u201d (as Brentano 1976: 146 put\nit). From a metaphysical perspective, it introduces asymmetries that\nmay be found disturbing, e.g. when it comes to explaining why\ncontact is only possible between entities of opposite sorts (Zimmerman\n1996b), or why each sort will have different part-whole grounding\nproperties (Smid 2015; Calosi 2018).\n\n(3) The boundary may belong both to A\nand to B, but the relevant overlap would be sui\ngeneris precisely insofar as it would involve lower-dimensional\nparts. Modulo the \u201cextended simples\u201d view mentioned in\nSection 1.4, boundaries do not take up space-time and so, on\nthis view, it is not implausible to say that (for example) the\nMason-Dixon line belongs to both Maryland and Pennsylvania. This was\nprobably Aristotle\u2019s own position, according to which\n\u201cthings are called continuous when the touching limits of each\nbecome one\u201d, i.e., \u201cone in number though two in\ndefinition\u201d (Physics, V, 227a11, VIII, 262a20). In some\ncases, however, this theory may require a blunt rejection of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (Priest 2006, chs. 11ff; Cotnoir and\nWeber 2015; Weber 2021, \u00a71.3). With reference to the\nSu\u00e1rez-Peirce puzzle, for instance, if the line of demarcation\nbetween a black spot and its white background belongs to both, then it\nmust be both white and black. A way out would be to deny that\nboundaries, qua lower-dimensional, can enjoy the same sort of\nproperties that characterize extended bodies, color properties being\namong them (Galton 2003: 167\u2013168). It is unclear, however,\nwhether this conservative strategy can be generalized. For instance, a\ncontradiction would seem to resurface with reference to Plato\u2019s\npuzzle and its variants in the temporal realm (Priest 1982, 1985;\nTanaka 1998): at the instant when a (homogeneous) object undergoes the\ntransition from being stationary to moving it would have to be both\nstationary and moving; at the instant when someone dies, the self-same\nperson would have to be both alive and dead; and so on. Thus, on the\nface of it, this is really a theory that would take us straight to\nHegel: \u201cThe limit is the mediation in virtue of which something\nand other each both is and is not\u201d (1833: 99).\n\n(4) There really are two boundaries, one belonging to\nA and one belonging to B, and these two boundaries\nare co-located \u2014 that is, they coincide spatially without\noverlapping mereologically. This view may be traced back to\nSu\u00e1rez, Disputation 40 (though see Schmaltz 2019 and\n2020, ch. 3, vs. Zimmerman 1996a), was distinctly endorsed by Brentano\n(1976), and in recent times has found many a follower, from Rhees\n(1938) to Sanford (1967) to Chisholm (1984, 1993, 1996), Smith (1997a,\n1999a), and Baumann et al. (2014, 2016). It may also have\nbeen another aspect of Aristotle\u2019s conception, insofar as he\nheld that things can be in contact, or contiguous, without being\ncontinuous in the sense mentioned in (3): in that case, Aristotle\nwrites, \u201ctheir extremities are together\u201d, i.e., \u201care\nin one primary place\u201d (Physics, V, 226b22\u201323; see\nBartha 2001, Pfeiffer 2018, ch. 7, Shatalov 2020, Sattler 2020, ch. 7,\nand Katz 2022 for extensive discussion). Apart from Aristotle\u2019s\npeculiar distinction, however, the main motivation for this view is to\ndo away with the \u201cmonstrous\u201d ontological differentiation\nbetween closed and open entities while preserving the important\ndistinction between contact and overlap. The spatial coincidence of\nboundaries would of course violate Locke\u2019s impenetrability\nprinciple, to the effect that whatever exists anywhere at any time\n\u201cexcludes all of the same kind\u201d (Essay,\nII-xxvii-1). Yet, again, the violation would be sui generis\ninsofar as the entities in question do not take up any space, so one\nneed not find it as outrageous as Bayle, for instance, made it sound\n(see Dictionary, art. Zeno, remark G). Indeed, it\ncould be argued that a coincidence-based account has several\nderivative advantages when it comes to modeling a number of phenomena\nthat are topologically problematic, such as the possibility of\ncollision or the fusion and fission of material bodies (Cotnoir 2019).\nWhether such considerations are enough to block other worries,\nhowever, remains to be determined. For instance, to the extent that\nlines can be colored, it would follow \u2014 as Brentano (1976: 41)\nexplicitly acknowledged \u2014 that the presence of a black spot on a\nwhite background would deliver two coincident boundaries, one black\nand one white. Would that result in something grey? (For discussion,\nsee Massin 2018 and Nu\u00f1ez Erices 2019; see also Chisholm 1980\nand Strobach 1998, ch. II.2, for parallel worries in the temporal\nrealm.)\n\nThese four views are mutually exclusive, but they need not be\nexhaustive and can be further articulated or integrated to address the\nissues raised by the other puzzles of Section 1. For example, with\nreference to the second puzzle (Section 1.2), Smith and Varzi (2000)\nconsider a double-barred theory that is of type (2) with respect to\nbona fide boundaries and of type (4) with respect to\nfiat boundaries (so there is no coincidence of real\nboundaries but merely of fiat articulations). Similarly, the\nindeterminacy hypothesis advocated by type-(2) theories can be\nregarded as being of a piece with the sort of indeterminacy that is\ninvolved in the phenomenon of boundary fuzziness (Section 1.3). For\nfiat boundaries, for instance, a de dicto account\nmay be applied in both cases: statements about such boundaries are\ntrue if and only if they are super-true, i.e., true under every\nadmissible way of precisifying the relevant fiat\narticulations (Varzi 2001 and references therein). There are other\noptions, too. For instance, Hudson (2001; 2005, ch. 3) offers an\naccount of boundaries that permits instances of each of (1), (2) and\n(3) (and without forfeiting the principle of non-contradiction). It is\nalso possible to reject the basic mereotopological setting that leads\nto the taxonomy above and, with it, the need to choose among\n(1)\u2013(4). See, for instance, Breysse and De Glas (2007) for a\nformal proposal in this spirit and Galton (1996, 2004), Donnelly and\nSmith (2003), and Donnelly (2003, 2004) for theories where the\ntreatment of boundaries of different dimensions (e.g. points as\nopposed to lines or surfaces) results in \u201clayered\u201d\nmereotopological systems. Finally, see Kraus (2016) for a theory that\ndoes away altogether with the assumption that boundaries must be\ndependent parts.\n2.2 Non-realist Theories\n\nNon-realist theories come in a large variety, especially insofar as\nthe banishment of boundaries can be part of broader projects concerned\nwith the social and cognitive construction of everyday reality.\nPerhaps the most radical view is that boundaries should not be reified\nfor the simple reason that their character is purely qualitative,\nnatural or artificial as the case may be. As H. H. Price once put it,\n\u201cthere is really no such entity as a surface; there are\nonly solid things thus and thus surfaced\u201d (1932: 106).\nBy extension, there would really be no such things as boundaries, only\nentities thus and thus bounded. This is straightforward ontological\neliminativism, as when one says that there are no holes but only\nobjects thus and thus holed (Lewis and Lewis 1970: 206), or no colors\nbut only things thus and thus colored (Quine 1948: 29\u201330). The\nmain challenge, then, is to go beyond the informal suggestion and\narticulate a systematic way of dealing in a similar fashion with every\nordinary sentence that seems to call for genuine reification. Can\nevery boundary-referring noun-phrase be de-nominalized this way? Can\nevery quantification over boundaries be reinterpreted as a\nquantification over bounded objects? Etc.\n\nFor the most part, however, non-realist accounts have concentrated on\nthe more limited task of reinterpreting ordinary boundary talk in the\ncontext of geometric and topological theorizing. Generally speaking,\nsuch accounts are not necessarily expression of an eliminativist\nontology. They are, rather, boundary-free. More precisely, they are\nfree from any genuine commitment to boundaries understood as the\nlower-dimensional entities endorsed by the realist theories outlined\nin Section 2.1. The common idea, here, is that deep down all such talk\ninvolves some sort of \u201cabstraction\u201d \u2014 an idea that\ncan be found already in the medieval and modern debates on\nanti-indivisibilism (Zupko 1993; Zimmerman 1996a; Holden 2004; Shapiro\nand Hellman 2021) and that made its way into contemporary formal\ntheories via Loba\u010devskij\u2019s New Principles\n(1835\u20131938). It is this idea that has recently become the focus\nof renewed attention in connection with the hypothesis that the\nuniverse might consist of \u201catomless gunk\u201d, as Lewis (1991:\n20) calls it, i.e., that either space and time or matter, or both,\ndivide forever into smaller and smaller parts (Zimmerman 1996b;\nMcDaniel 2006; Hudson 2007; Russell 2008). What sort of abstraction\nwould be involved here? And how can one account for our ordinary and\nmathematical talk about boundaries if these are to be conceived of as\nmere abstractions?\n\nWith special reference to the boundaries of spatio-temporal\nparticulars, we may distinguish two main approaches. (Our taxonomy,\nhere, will be rather sketchy; for a fuller picture, see Vakarelov\n2007, Hahmann and Gr\u00fcninger 2012, and the monographs by Gorzka\n2003 and Gruszczy\u0144ski 2016.)\n\n(A) Substantivalists about space-time may see the abstraction\nas stemming from the relationship between a particular and its\nspatio-temporal receptacle, relying on the topology of space-time to\naccount for our boundary talk when it comes to specific cases. It has\nbeen held, for instance, that material bodies are the material content\nof open regions of space, more specifically regular open regions,\nboundary contact between bodies being explained in terms of overlap\nbetween the closures of their receptacles. (An open region is regular\nif it is equal to the interior of its own closure. This rules out, for\ninstance, regions lacking what would commonly be described as a single\ninterior point, or regions with ingrowing boundary\n\u201ccracks\u201d.) This view can be traced back to Descartes\n(Principles II.15) and has been explicitly articulated by\nCartwright (1975). It does, to be sure, yield a hybrid account, an\naccount that does away only with the boundaries of material bodies\n(and, by extension, events); their receptacles are typically subject\nto a standard topology in which boundaries are treated as per theory\n(2) above. Yet this account is enough to bypass the puzzles of Section\n1 (especially 1.1) insofar as there is no pressing problem in assuming\na standard topology for space-time and, with it, the distinction\nbetween open and closed regions. The main problem for the theory is,\nrather, to justify the claim that only some regions (open\nregular regions, for instance) are receptacles. (See Hudson 2002 for a\nchallenge to this view, and Uzquiano 2006 for a defense.) On the other\nhand, there are more radical, non-hybrid theories that do away with\nboundaries also with regard to the structure of space-time.\nTopological theories of this sort may be found e.g. in Johanson\n(1981), Randell, Cui, and Cohn 1992), Asher and Vieu (1995), Forrest\n(1996), Roeper (1997), Pratt-Hartmann (2007), and Hellman and Shapiro\n(2018), but see also Gerla (1990) for a geometric account, Skyrms\n(1993) and Arntzenius (2008) for measure-theoretic alternatives, and\nLando and Scott (2019) for a robust approach combining both topology\nand measure theory. In the temporal realm, the same approach has\ninspired much work in so-called interval semantics for tense logic,\nbeginning with Hamblin (1971) and Humberstone (1979).\n\n(B) If one is not a substantivalist about space and/or time,\nthe abstractionist approach is even more tempting. For if space and/or\ntime are themselves abstractions emerging from concrete relations\namong material bodies and/or events, then, as Whitehead put it, it\nseems illegitimate to \u201cassume sub silentio\u201d that\nboundary elements are among the latter (1919: 5). In particular, it\nseems natural to treat them as mere \u201cconceptual limits\u201d\nemerging from the progressive contemplation of ever thinner layers of\nthe bounded entities with which we are directly acquainted (1916:\n730). The best formulation of this idea is Whitehead\u2019s own\ntheory of \u201cextensive abstraction\u201d, originally developed in\npurely mereological terms and later refined in mereotopological terms\nfrom suggestions by De Laguna (1921, 1922) and Nicod (1924: I.4) (see\nWhitehead 1929, Part IV) and variously endorsed by Broad (1923: ch.\n1), Russell (1927: ch. 28), Stebbing (1930: ch. 23), and eventually\nMenger (1940) and others. On this account, boundary elements are no\nlonger viewed as lower-dimensional entities; they are, rather,\nhigher-order constructs, viz. equivalence classes of\nconvergent series of nested bodies \u201cpacked one within the other\nlike the nest of boxes of a Chinese toy\u201d (Whitehead 1920: 61),\nbut with no smallest box. For example, the series of all concentric\nspheres included in a given sphere converges to the point at\nthe center, the series of all concentric right cylinders of equal\nlength included in a given cylinder converge to the axial\nline, and so on. Call a convergent series of this sort an\nabstractive class if and only if it has no bottom, i.e., if\nand only if no object is part of every member of the class. And call\ntwo co-convergent abstractive classes equivalent if and only\nif every member of the first class has a member of the second as part,\nand vice versa. For instance, an abstractive class of spheres is\nequivalent to the class of all the cubes inscribed in the spheres,\nwhich converge to the same point at the center, etc. Then each\nboundary element can be viewed as an equivalence class of suitably\ndefined converging abstractive classes, and if things are done\nproperly, one can eventually reconstruct ordinary talk about\nlower-dimensional boundaries as talk about such higher-order entities.\n(For details, see Clarke 1985 and Varzi 2021.) This approach has\nanalogues also in the temporal realm, where instants can be construed\nmore directly as convergent classes of nested time intervals, which in\nturn can be construed as sets of overlapping events. (The locus\nclassicus, directly inspired by Whitehead\u2019s thinking, is\nRussell 1914, but see also Walker 1947, Kamp 1979, van Benthem 1983,\nand Vakarelov 2015.) Moreover, the approach itself is amenable to\nseveral variants, depending on exactly which primitives one assumes.\nWhitehead himself eventually settled on a framework based on a\nprimitive binary relation of topological connection; a popular\nalternative formulation, following Tarski (1929), uses instead\nparthood along with as a special unary primitive \u2018x is\na sphere\u2019, defining e.g. a geometric point as the class of all\nspheres that are concentric \u2014 in a suitably defined sense\n\u2014 with a given one. (For details and developments of this\nalternative approach, see Bennett 2001, Gruszczy\u0144ski and\nPietruszczak 2008, Betti and Loeb 2012, and Clay 2017; for extensions\nand further variants, Borgo and Masolo 2010, Borgo 2013, and Gerla and\nGruszczy\u0144ski 2017.) Another influential variant, though\ndeveloped independently, is the point-free topology of Grzegorczyk\n(1960), which is based on parthood along with a primitive notion of\n\u2018spatial body\u2019 and a binary relation of separation, i.e.,\nthe opposite of connection. This theory is closely related to\nWhitehead\u2019s (see Biacino and Gerla 1996) and has recently been\nworked out in full detail by Gruszczy\u0144ski and Pietruszczak\n(2018, 2019). (Point-free topologies were initially called\npointless topologies, following Johnstone 1983, but the\nterminology has aptly been updated.)\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, these two approaches tend to overlap in\nmany ways. In particular, Whitehead\u2019s technique is often used\nalso in the context of substantivalists theories, as with the\n\u201cRegion Connection Calculus\u201d of Randell et al.\n(1992), which has proved highly influential in the computational\ntreatment of boundary-free spatial reasoning. Moreover, both sorts of\ntheories face a number of common questions when it comes to specifying\nthe ontological assumptions on which they rest. Formally they are all\nboundary-free, which means that, in a logical setting, their variables\nare meant to range exclusively over extended regions or bodies. Yet\nnot all such things are equal; is there room for interesting\ndistinctions? For instance, should these theories have room for the\nstandard topological distinction between open and closed entities?\nShould they preserve the distinction between regular entities and\nirregular ones? Some authors find such distinctions unintelligible\nfrom a boundary-free perspective. Randell et al. (1992), for\ninstance, rule them out at the outset, and Bostock (2010) rules them\nout by argument. However others disagree, beginning with Clarke\n(1981), who actually provides detailed instructions on how to retrieve\nall standard topological distinctions within the framework of\nWhitehead\u2019s theory. (For other theories, see Cohn and Varzi\n2003.) Of course, retrieving them formally doesn\u2019t mean much;\nthe distinctions may still collapse. But do they \u2014 or should\nthey \u2014 collapse?\n\nOther questions may be more or less pressing depending on one\u2019s\ngeneral philosophical concerns. For example, a common objection to\ntype-(B) theories is that the abstractness of boundaries would seem to\nrun afoul of the abstractness of set-theoretic constructions. One can\nsee and paint the surface of a table, and in principle one could even\nsee and paint an infinite series of ever thinner layers of\ntable-parts; but one cannot see or paint the set of these\nparts, even less an equivalence class of such sets (Simons 1991: 96).\nEven de Laguna, one of the very first sponsors of Whitehead\u2019s\nmethod, remarked that the identification of points and other\nboundaries with abstractive sets is open to serious misinterpretation:\n\u201cAlthough we perceive solids, we perceive no abstractive sets of\nsolids [\u2026] In accepting the abstractive set, we are as\nveritably going beyond experience as in accepting the solid of\nzero-length\u201d (1922: 460). This is not a formal objection.\nIndeed, there are philosophers who, such as Maddy (1980), believe that\nsets can be perceived, at least sets of physical objects such\nas tables. Nonetheless, the perceptibility of an infinite equivalence\nclass remains problematic. It is especially problematic if, as in\nWhitehead\u2019s case, the motivation for going boundary-free is\ngrounded on a broadly empiricist epistemology.\n\nFinally, there is room for speculations concerning different\nnon-realist strategies one might consider besides type-(A) and\ntype-(B) theories. At the moment, the main option that received some\nattention in the literature appears to be an\n\u201coperationalist\u201d account of the sort advocated by Adams\n(1984, 1996), where the abstractive process by which boundary elements\nare constructed out of concrete observables is explained in terms of\n\u201coperational tests\u201d. Such an account might meet De\nLaguna\u2019s worries. Arguably, however, it is best regarded as a\nparallel story. It may offer an explanation of our empirical knowledge\nconcerning boundaries, but it remains ultimately neutral with regard\nto their ontological status.\n3. Other Topics\n\nThe issues and theories outlined above define the main coordinates\nwithin which the nature of boundaries has been a subject of\nphilosophical concern since antiquity. To this, we may add that in\nrecent times the range of concerns has broadened significantly, with\nramifications that extend well beyond the scope of formal metaphysical\ntheorizing.\n3.1 Border Studies\n\nWe already mentioned, in this regard, the growing interest in the use\nand abuse of boundary concepts in the geopolitical domain,\nparticularly in reference to the traditional opposition between\nso-called natural borders and artificial borders (Section 1.2).\nGeopolitical borders are the spatial records of very complex patterns\nof interaction \u2014 through political agreement, unilateral\nstipulation, or warfare \u2014 between neighboring communities. They\nare, as Foucher (2007: 28) put it, \u201ctraces of time inscribed in\nspace\u201d, always in flux between division and union, between the\n\u201cscars\u201d of history (Mozer 1973: 14) and the\n\u201cseams\u201d of geography (Cinalli and Jacobson 2020: 43). Even\nin times of peace there are entire industries (of real estate law,\ncadastral registration, land surveying) as well as a host of\nadministrative offices (of passport control, customs and immigration\ncheck, etc.) that are devoted to the maintenance of such traces\n(Crawford 2022). The ancient Romans actually had a god, Terminus,\npresiding over all boundary markers, with a major\n\u201cTerminalia\u201d festival celebrated yearly on the last day of\ntheir calendar (Dionysius, Roman Antiquities, II, 74; Ovid,\nFasti, II, 639\u2013684; Plutarch, Roman Questions,\nXV, Numa, XVI).\n\nIt is hard to regard all of this as being merely about some abstract\nfa\u00e7on de parler. But it is equally hard to locate the\nsource of its enormous importance in our political and social\nlives, disentangling myth from science, culture from nature, power\nfrom government. The emergence of \u201cborder studies\u201d as a\nbroadly interdisciplinary field of research bears witness to the\nincreasing awareness of these difficulties and of their practical and\ntheoretical importance (see Wastl-Walter 2011 and Wilson and Donnan\n2012 for comprehensive handbooks). And while the interdisciplinary\nnature of the field draws primarily from geography, anthropology,\nsociology, environmental psychology, economics, political science, and\nlaw, deep down the issues belong to the very core of political\nphilosophy and deliver further perspectives from which to assess the\nphilosophical significance of borders, frontiers, and boundaries more\ngenerally. (See e.g. the recent publication of Cooper and Tinning\n2019.)\n3.2 Boundaries in the Life Sciences\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the growing interest in\nboundary-related issues in the life sciences and the philosophy\nthereof. By themselves, the remarks of section 1.2 on the\nnatural/artificial opposition are already enough to suggest a\nboundary-based reading of many contemporary debates on, say, the\nfoundations of biology. Biological taxonomies are the result of\n\u201ccircumscribing\u201d and classifying individual organisms into\ntaxa of various ranks (species, genera, families, etc.), so any\ncontroversy between realists vs. antirealists, essentialists vs.\nconventionalists, or even monists vs. pluralists may to some extent be\nseen as stemming from different ways of assessing the ontological\nstatus of the relevant taxonomic boundaries (cf. Hull 1974,\nDupr\u00e9 1993, Kitcher 2001, Ereshefsky 2001). The vicissitudes of\nthe chimera, in ancient mythology (Ebbesen 1986) as well as in\ncontemporary genetics (Bonnicksen 2009, Hyun and De Los Angeles 2019),\nare perhaps the best illustration of science\u2019s constant\nstruggling with the status of such boundaries, with all that it\nentails, on ethical and scientific grounds, in the special case of the\nboundaries that define the human species (see the entry on\n human/non-human chimeras).\n\nYet this is only one way in which boundaries are at work, and open to\nphilosophical theorizing, in the field of biology. Another, equally\nimportant way emerges in the study of the organism-environment\nrelations that are so central to the understanding of evolution.\nConsider, for instance, the partitioning of the ecological environment\neffected by what biologists call \u201cniche construction\u201d\n(Odling-Smee et al. 2003; Sultan 2015). There are niches that are\nfully enclosed within a physical retainer, such as an egg, a closed\noyster shell, or a larval chamber; niches that, like a kangaroo pouch\nor a bear\u2019s cave, are bound partly by a physical boundary and\npartly by an immaterial boundary marking (more or less vaguely) the\nopening through which the organism is free to leave; niches that are\nbounded by a physical retainer to a very low extent, as with the niche\nof the oxpecker removing ticks from the back of an African rhinoceros\n(bounded by a part of the rhinoceros\u2019s hide); and, finally,\nniches that lack a physical retainer altogether and are bordered\nentirely by boundaries of the fiat sort, as with a fish\norbiting underwater or a falcon in the sky circling above the area\nwhere its prey is to be found.\n\nIt is remarkable how closely such a variety of niche structures\nmirrors the variety of boundary structures that we find in the\ngeopolitical world (Smith and Varzi 1999, 2002). The prima\nfacie strength and protective function of any particular niche\n\u2014 what Gibson (1979) calls its \u201caffordance\ncharacter\u201d \u2014 is to a large degree determined by the sort\nof boundaries that delimit it. And just as the history of geopolitical\nboundaries is, to a great extent, a history of the\n\u201crazor\u2019s edge\u201d on which hang suspended all issues\n\u201cof life or death to nations\u201d (Curzon 1907: 7), so the\nhistory of evolution and biological survival is, in many ways, a\nhistory of the growth in complexity of \u201cthe constant interplay\nof the organism and the environment\u201d (Lewontin 1978: 215). The\nmechanisms of what has come to be called \u201cautopoiesis\u201d\n(Maturana and Varela 1972) can similarly be described in terms of a\nsystem\u2019s ability to maintain and renew itself by regulating its\ncomposition and conserving its boundaries. And once we see things from\nthis perspective, it is a short step to see the same mechanisms at\nwork also in the structuring of our relations with the social\nenvironment, from personal space (Hull 1966) to human territoriality\nat large (Sack 1986; Taylor 1988). In all these cases, the question is\nnot only what boundaries are; it is how they function and how they\nserve the things they bound (Ludu 2016; Werner 2021, 2022).\n3.3 Boundary Perception\n\nLastly, it needs stressing that boundaries occupy a prominent position\nalso in the mapping of reality that emerges from our individual\ncognitive acts. Above all, the contents of perception tend to be\nstructured in terms of figure-ground organization, which is to say the\norganization of the visual field into objects that stand out from\ntheir surroundings (Rubin 1915), and here again we find a tension\nbetween bona fide and fiat articulations whose\nphilosophical significance extends well beyond the remarks of Section\n1.2.\n\nOn the one hand, the objects we see and track most easily are those\nthat stand out by virtue of the natural boundaries they seem to enjoy.\nThe use of edge-detection techniques for object recognition in\ncomputer vision (see e.g. Davies 2012) is motivated precisely by this\nconsideration, for in normal circumstances such boundaries correspond\nto salient discontinuities in the depth and brightness of the\nperceived scene. The very fact that humans, from the time they are\ninfants, tend to reify such non-entities as holes and shadows just as\neasily as they do with regard to material objects (Giralt and Bloom\n2000; Nelson and Palmer 2001) lends evidence to the importance of\n\u201cnatural\u201d discontinuities in the segmentation of the\nvisual scene: the possession of a genuine boundary is a sign of\nobjecthood.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also a fact that sometimes we parse the\nvisual scene in terms of boundaries that involve the creative\ncontribution of our perceptual apparatus, which, as we know from\nSchumann\u2019s classic work on illusory contours, tends to\narticulate reality in terms of continuous borders even when such\nborders \u201care objectively not there\u201d (1900: 26).\nKanizsa\u2019s triangle (1955) is perhaps the example that best\nepitomizes this phenomenon. But the same could be said of many other\nways in which fiat boundaries emerge from the figure-ground\norganization of the visual field through the basic factors studied by\nGestalt psychologists, such as proximity, continuity, closure, color\nand texture similarity, good form, etc. (Wertheimer 1923; Koffka\n1935). There is, we said, no bona fide boundary in a Seurat painting,\nexcept perhaps around each individual color spot; yet we see each\n\u201cfigure\u201d as though it possessed a regular contour.\n\nIn Section 1.2 we noted that such considerations are relevant to the\nmetaphysical question of whether all boundaries \u2014 and, with\nthem, the identity and persistence conditions of those things that\nhave boundaries \u2014 are on closer look the product of our own\nworldmaking, a sign of that mismatch between appearance and reality\nthat may lead one to embrace an across-the-board anti-realist stance\ntowards the ontology of ordinary objects and events. That is one\nimportant line of philosophical inquiry. But one may also want to know\nmore about the structure of appearance as such. One may be interested\nin the mechanisms of perceptual organization insofar as they may\nreveal something about us. This is a distinguished subject of\ninquiry in philosophy over and above its significance for psychology\n(see Wagemans 2015 for a representative collection of recent work). It\nis, for sure, an important subject of further inquiry for anyone\ninterested in the surreptitious, pervasive, stubborn, enigmatic\nintrusion of boundaries in our picture of the world.\n4. Excerpts from the Literature\n\nThe entry concludes with a sample of significant passages from the\nphilosophical literature, listed in approximate chronological order.\nSome come from texts cited explicitly in the foregoing sections; the\nothers provide further indicative evidence of the many dimensions\nalong which the boundary concept has been analyzed and subjected to\nphilosophical inquiry throughout history.\n\nZhuangzi, Essentials for Nurturing Life, 2 (1994:\n26\u201327)\n The cook put down his cleaver and responded. [\u2026] In accord\nwith the natural grain, I slice at the great crevices, lead the blade\nthrough the great cavities. Following its inherent structure, I never\nencounter the slightest obstacle even where the veins and arteries\ncome together or where the ligaments and tendons join, much less from\nobvious big bones. A good cook changes his cleaver once a year because\nhe chops. An ordinary cook changes his cleaver once a month because he\nhacks. Now I\u2019ve been using my cleaver for nineteen years and\nhave cut up thousands of oxen with it, but the blade is still as fresh\nas though it had just come from the grindstone.\n\n\nPlato, Phaedrus, 265e (1997: 542)\n [The goal of the method of division] is to be able to cut up each\nkind according to its species along its natural joints, and to try not\nto splinter any part, as a bad butcher might do.\n\n\nPlato, Parmenides, 156c\u2013d (1997: 388)\n [A thing] won\u2019t be able to undergo being previously at rest\nand later in motion or being previously in motion and later at rest\nwithout changing. [\u2026] Yet there is no time in which something\ncan, simultaneously, be neither in motion nor at rest. [\u2026] Yet\nsurely it also doesn\u2019t change without changing. [\u2026] Is\nthere, then, this queer thing in which it might be, just when it\nchanges? \u2014 What queer thing? \u2014 The instant. The instant\nseems to signify something such that changing occurs from it to each\nof two states. For a thing doesn\u2019t change from rest while rest\ncontinues, or from motion while motion continues. Rather, this queer\ncreature, the instant, lurks between motion and rest.\n\n\nAristotle, Physics, VI, 234a24\u2013b9 (1984:\n395\u2013396)\n [N]othing can be in motion in a now. [\u2026] Nor can anything\nbe at rest. [\u2026] Inasmuch as it is the same now that belongs to\nboth the times [past and future], and it is possible for a thing to be\nin motion throughout one time and to be at rest throughout the other,\nand that which is in motion or at rest for the whole of a time will be\nin motion or at rest in any part of it in which it is of such a nature\nas to be in motion or at rest: it [would] follow that the same thing\ncan at the same time be at rest and in motion; for both the times have\nthe same extremity, viz. the now. [\u2026] It follows then that the\nmotion of that which is in motion and the rest of that which is at\nrest must occupy time.\n\n\nAristotle, Metaphysics, V, 1022a4\u20135 (1984:\n1613).\n We call a limit the last point of each thing, i.e., the first\npoint beyond which it is not possible to find any part, and the first\npoint within which every part is. [Note: This standard translation\ndiffers from the one given in Section 1 above, which did not use the\nword \u2018point\u2019. The Greek text only says \u2018the\nlast\u2019 and \u2018the first\u2019, without accompanying sortals,\nso a generic word such as \u2018thing\u2019 seemed more appropriate\nin the present context than \u2018point\u2019.] \n\n\nAristotle, Metaphysics, XI, 1060b12\u201317 (1984:\n1675\u20131676)\n If we are to suppose lines or what comes after these (I mean the\nprimary surfaces) to be principles, these at least are not separable\nsubstances, but sections and divisions \u2014 the former of surfaces,\nthe latter of bodies (while points are sections and divisions of\nlines); and further they are limits of these same things; and all\nthese are in other things and none is separable. \n\n\nEuclid, Elements, I, defs. 1\u20133, 5\u20136, 13\n(1926: 153)\n A point is that which has no part. A line is breadthless length.\nThe extremities of a line are points. [\u2026] A surface is that\nwhich has length and breadth only. The extremities of a surface are\nlines. [\u2026] A boundary is that which is an extremity of\nanything.\n\n\nOvid, Fasti, II, 657\u2013660 (2000: 47)\n The simple neighborhood meets and celebrates the feast, and\nchants your praises, holy Terminus: You confine peoples and cities and\ngreat kingdoms; all land would be disputed without you. You seek\nnone\u2019s favour, you are bribed by no gold; you guard entrusted\nlands with pledge of law. \n\n\nPlutarch, Numa, XVI, 1\u20132 (1914: 363)\n Terminus signifies boundary, and to this god they make\npublic and private sacrifices where their fields are set off by\nboundaries; of living victims nowadays, but anciently the sacrifice\nwas a bloodless one, since Numa reasoned that the god of boundaries\nwas a guardian of peace and a witness of just dealing, and should\ntherefore be clear of slaughter. [\u2026] He knew that a boundary,\nif observed, fetters lawless power; and if not observed, convicts of\ninjustice. \n\n\nAulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, VI.xiii.5\u20136 (1795:\n2/32)\n It was asked, When a dying man could be said to die; at the time\nhe actually expired, or when he was on the point of expiring? When a\nperson rising could be said to rise; when he actually stood, or when\nhe was but just sitting? He who learned any art, at what time he\nbecame an artist; when he was really one, or when he was just not one?\nIf you assert any one of these, you assert what is absurd and\nridiculous; yet it will appear more absurd, if you assert both or\nallow neither. \n\n\nSextus Empiricus, Against the Physicists, I, 269 (2012:\n52\u201353)\n Socrates dies either while being or while not being. [\u2026]\nWell, when he is and is alive, he does not die; after all, he is\nalive; but again, he does not die having died, since then he will be\ndying twice, which is absurd. So Socrates does not die. \n\n\nSextus Empiricus, Against the Physicists, I,\n260\u2013264 (2012: 51\u201352)\n [A] whole does not reasonably touch a whole; for if a whole\ntouches a whole, it will not be touching but a unification of them\nboth, and the two bodies will be one body. [\u2026] Then again, it\nis not possible for a part to touch a part. For the part is conceived\nas a part in virtue of its state in relation to the whole, but in\nterms of its own limits it is a whole. [\u2026] Then again, nor does\na whole touch a part. For if the whole is going to touch the part, the\nwhole, being shrunk down together with the part, will be a part, and\nthe part, being stretched out alongside the whole, will be a whole.\n[\u2026] And the same argument applies to the converse. [\u2026]\nHence if neither the whole touches the whole, nor the part the part,\nnor the whole the part, nor the reverse, nothing touches anything.\n\n\n\nJohn of Damascus, The Fount of Knowledge, I, 8 (1958:\n27)\n Definition is the term for the setting of land boundaries taken\nin a metaphorical sense. For, just as the boundary separates that\nwhich belongs to one from that which belongs to another, so does the\ndefinition set off the nature of one thing from that of any other.\n\n\n\nBoethius, Second Commentary on Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\nI, xi, 14\u201321 (1994: 23\u201324)\n A line is something in a body.

[\u2026] In\naddition, there are on a surface many corporeal or sensible qualities,\nas it seems.

[\u2026] Therefore a surface is the\ncommon boundary of two bodies which are not continuous, and does not\nform part of either one or the other, for if the surface formed part\nof it, it would have divisible bulk, whereas, however, it is not\ndivisible and nothingness divides these bodies the one from the other.\n\n\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, al-Asf\u0101r\nal-Arba\u2018a, IV, 274 (Eng. trans. from Rezaei and Bozorgi\n2001: 34)\n If there is no common boundary between water and air which is the\nwarmest instance of water and the coldest of air, it will require that\nin an instance, that is when water transforms into air, hyle\nstays formless, which is impossible. \n\n\nMichelangelo Buonarroti, Sonnet 151, 1\u20134 (1996:\n195)\n The greatest artist does not have any concept which a single\npiece of marble does not itself contain within its excess, though only\na hand that obeys the intellect can discover it. \n\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V,\n\u00a741 (1861: 562\u2013563; Eng. trans. by Robert Pasnau)\n [I]t could plausibly be said that a line can be conserved by God\nwithout a limiting point, and a surface without a line, and a body\nwithout a surface. \n\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, Metaphysical Disputations 40, V,\n\u00a758 (1861: 567; Eng. trans. by Robert Pasnau)\n Suppose that, in the continuous surface of a wall, one half is\nmaximally white and the other half is maximally black, and those\nqualities each have their own indivisible boundaries\n[termini] by which they are contained and limited.

[\u2026]\nSomething, as an immediate existence, is therefore the limit with\nrespect to another something; but it has this limit in it and\nis something through the mediation of that limit, which is just as\nmuch its non-being. The limit is the mediation in virtue of which\nsomething and other each both is and is not. \n\n\nLoba\u010devskij, New Principles of Geometry\n(1835\u20131938: 21\u201322)\n Surfaces, lines, points, as geometry defines them, exist only in\nour imagination. [\u2026] We will attach ourselves only to ideas\nwhich in our mind unite themselves directly to the conception of\nbodies to which our imagination is habituated. \n\n\nBernard Bolzano Paradoxes of the Infinite, \u00a766\n(1851: 167\u2013168)\n I define the limit of a body as the aggregate of all the\nextreme [\u00e4usserst] ether-atoms which still\nbelong to it. [\u2026] A closer consideration further shows\nthat many bodies are at certain places altogether devoid of limiting\natoms; none of their atoms can be described as the extreme\nones among those which still belong to it and would accompany it if it\nstarted to move. [Two bodies are in contact] when the extreme atoms of\nthe one, [\u2026] together with certain atoms of the other, form a\ncontinuous extension. \n\n\nFranz Brentano, \u2018Nativistic, Empiricist, and Anoetistic\nTheories of our Presentation of Space\u2019 (1976: 146)\n One of the two lines into which the line would be split upon\ndivision would [\u2026] have an end point, but the other no\nbeginning point. This inference has been quite correctly drawn by\nBolzano, who was led thereby to his monstrous doctrine that there\nwould exist bodies with and without surfaces, the one class containing\njust so many as the other, because contact would be possible only\nbetween a body with a surface and another without. He ought, rather,\nto have had his attention drawn by such consequences to the fact that\nthe whole conception of the line and of other continua as sets of\npoints runs counter to the concept of contact and thereby abolishes\nprecisely what makes up the essence of the continuum. \n\n\nFranz Brentano, \u2018On What Is Continuous\u2019 (1976: 12 and\n41)\n Because a boundary, even when itself continuous, can never exist\nexcept as belonging to something continuous of more dimensions\n[\u2026], it is, considered for itself, nothing other than a\nuniversal, to which \u2014 as to other universals \u2014 more than\none thing can correspond. And the geometer\u2019s proposition that\nonly one straight line is conceivable between two points, is\nstrictly speaking false. [\u2026] If a red surface and a blue\nsurface are in contact with each other, then a red and a blue line\ncoincide. \n\n\nCharles S. Peirce, \u2018The Logic of Quantity\u2019 (1893:\n7.127)\n A drop of ink has fallen upon the paper and I have walled it\nround. Now every point of the area within the walls is either black or\nwhite; and no point is both black and white. That is plain. The black\nis, however, all in one spot or blot; it is within bounds. There is a\nline of demarcation between the black and the white. Now I ask about\nthe points of this line, are they black or white? Why one more than\nthe other? Are they (A) both black and white or (B) neither black nor\nwhite? Why A more than B, or B more than A? [\u2026] The logical\nconclusion [\u2026] is that the points of the boundary do not exist.\n\n\n\nAmbrose Bierce, \u2018The Devil\u2019s Dictionary\u2019 (1881:\n323)\n Boundary, n. In political geography, an imaginary line\nbetween two nations, separating the imaginary rights of one from the\nimaginary rights of the other. \n\n\nGottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic \u00a726\n(1884: 35)\n One calls the equator an imaginary line, but it would be wrong to\ncall it a line that has merely been thought up. It was not created by\nthought as the result of a psychological process, but is only\napprehended or grasped by thought. If its being apprehended were a\nmatter of its coming into being, then we could not say anything\npositive about the equator for any time prior to this supposed coming\ninto being. \n\n\nGottlob Frege, The Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic, Vol.\nII, \u00a756 (1903: 159)\n A definition of a concept (of a possible predicate) must\n[\u2026] unambiguously determine, as regards any object, whether or\nnot it falls under the concept. [\u2026] We may express this\nmetaphorically as follows: the concept must have a sharp boundary. To\na concept without sharp boundary there would correspond an area that\nhad not a sharp boundary-line all around, but in places just vaguely\nfaded away into the background. [\u2026] The law of the excluded\nmiddle is really just another form of the requirement that the concept\nshould have a sharp boundary. \n\n\nGeorge Nathaniel Curzon, Frontiers (1907: 13 and 54)\n I have accepted the broad distinction between Natural and\nArtificial Frontiers, both as generally recognized, and as\nscientifically the most exact. [\u2026] There is also a class of\nso-called Natural Frontiers which I have been obliged to omit, as\npossessing no valid claim to the title, namely those which are claimed\nby nations as natural on grounds of ambition, or expediency, or more\noften sentiment. The attempt to realize Frontiers of this type has\nbeen responsible for many of the wars, and some of the most tragic\nvicissitudes in history. .\n\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois, The Souls of Black Folk (1903: vi, 13,\n40); also in \u2018The Color Line Belts the World\u2019 (1906:\n30)\n The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the\ncolor-line. \n\n\nLucien Febvre, La Terre et l\u2019\u00e9volution\nhumaine (1922: 297)\n For the whole problem is, or appears to us to be, a question of\nboundaries. Within us, so deeply implanted that we no longer notice\nits hold on us, there is a certain idea of the \u2018natural\nlimits\u2019 of the great States which causes us to think of their\nboundaries as things in themselves, having an actual value, a kind of\nmechanical virtue, and a compulsory and at the same time creative\npower. [\u2026] A whole philosophy of history [is] comprised in that\nword \u2018natural\u2019. \n\n\nWilliam James, Pragmatism (1907: 247)\n Hence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain\narbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions we trace the\nfield\u2019s extent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its\nbackground; by our order we read it in this direction or in that. We\nreceive in short the block of marble, but we carve the statue\nourselves. \n\n\nErnst Cassirer, Philosophie der symbolischen Formen\n(1923: 280)\n The beginning of thought and speech is not this: we do not simply\nseize on and name certain distinctions that are somewhere present in\nfeeling or intuition; on the contrary, on our own initiative we draw\ncertain dividing lines, effect certain separations and connections, by\nvirtue of which distinct individual configurations emerge from the\nuniform flux of consciousness. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,\n5.6\n The limits [Grenzen] of my language mean the limits of\nmy world. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations, I,\n\u00a799 (1953: 45e)\n An indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all. Here one\nthinks perhaps: if I say \u2018I have locked the man up fast in the\nroom \u2014 there is only one door left open\u2019 \u2014 then I\nsimply haven\u2019t locked him in at all; his being locked in is a\nsham. \n\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology, II, \u00a7626 (1980: 108e)\n It is unnatural to draw a conceptual boundary line where there is\nnot some special justification for it, where similarities would\nconstantly draw us across the arbitrarily drawn line. \n\n\nAlfred N. Whitehead, An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of\nNatural Knowledge (1919: 5)\n An investigation into the foundations of geometry has to explain\nspace as a complex of relations between things. It has to describe\nwhat a point is, and has to show how the geometric relations between\npoints issue from the ultimate relations between the ultimate things\nwhich are the immediate objects of knowledge. Thus the starting point\nof a discussion on the foundations of geometry is a discussion of the\ncharacter of the immediate data of perception. It is not now open to\nmathematicians to assume sub silentio that points are among\nthese data. \n\n\nWilliam Ernest Johnson, Logic, Part III: The Logical\nFoundations of Science (1924: 163\u2013164)\n We are thus led to distinguish between the parts of a whole, and\nthe boundaries between these parts. The parts of a line are lines, the\nparts of an area are areas, the parts of a region are regions; but the\nboundary between contiguous parts of a line is a point, and the\nboundary between contiguous parts of an area is a line, and the\nboundary between contiguous parts of a region is an area or surface.\nThe parts of a whole, therefore, are homogeneous with one another and\nwith the whole; but [\u2026] the boundaries between two contiguous\nparts are always of one lower order of dimensions than the parts.\n\n\n\nSusan Stebbing, A Modern Introduction to Logic (1930: 452\nand 451)\n [The] success of physics in dealing with the sensible world is\ninexplicable unless such expressions as \u2018point\u2019,\n\u2018line\u2019, \u2018moment\u2019, \u2018instantaneous\nspace\u2019, \u2018momentary configurations\u2019 can be\nexpressed in terms of what is sensible. [\u2026] It does not matter\nthat a point should prove to be a complicated structure provided that\nits logical relations are simple and have the necessary\nformal properties. [\u2026] All that matters in deduction are the\npurely formal, or logical, properties of the terms that enter into the\ndeduction; the nature of the term itself has no relevance.\n\n\n\nRobert Musil, The Man Without Qualities (1930: 22)\n Ultimately a thing exists only by virtue of its boundaries, which\nmeans by a more or less hostile act against its surroundings: without\nthe Pope there would have been no Luther, and without the pagans no\nPope. \n\n\nH. H. Price, Perception (1932: 106)\n A surface must be the surface of something; and not merely that,\nit must be the surface of some material thing. Indeed, there is really\nno such entity as a surface; there are only solid things thus\nand thus surfaced. \u2018Surface,\u2019 it is true, is a\nsubstantive in grammar; but it is not the name of a particular\nexistent, but of an attribute. \n\n\nPercy Stanley Fritz, Colorado, the Centennial State\n(1941: 3)\n The State of Colorado is primarily a mental concept. It is an\narbitrary political designation made for convenience sake. There are\nno natural boundaries whatsoever. If, when you leave the State of\nColorado in your automobile, you should miss seeing the sign by the\nroadside which says \u2018Colorado\u2013Kansas\u2019, you would\nnever know that you had passed from one State to the other. [\u2026]\nIf a windstorm happened to carry away the state boundary sign, it\nwould require a surveyor with precision instruments to tell where the\nboundary was. The State of Colorado is simply a convenient legal\nfiction. \n\n\nJan O. M. Broek, \u2018The Problem of Natural Frontiers\u2019\n(1941: 8)\n One of the most powerful arguments to make a frontier seem just\nis to stamp it as a natural frontier.\n\n\nStephen Jones, Boundary-Making (1945: 3)\n The goodness or badness of a boundary depends as much upon the\ngeneral situation as upon the details of delimitation and demarcation.\nA boundary, like the human skin, may have diseases of its own or may\nreflect the illnesses of the body. \n\n\nMartin Heidegger, \u2018Building Dwelling Thinking\u2019 (1952:\n154)\n A boundary is not that at which something stops but, as the\nGreeks recognized, the boundary is that from which something\nbegins its presencing. \n\n\nJohn L. Austin, Sense and Sensibilia (1962: 100)\n It is [\u2026] wrong to imply that everything has a surface.\nWhere and what exactly is the surface of a cat? \n\n\nJ. J. Gibson, The Ecological Approach to Visual\nPerception (1979: 23)\n The surface is where most of the action is. The surface is where\nlight is reflected or absorbed, not the interior of the substance. The\nsurface is what touches the animal, not the interior. The surface is\nwhere chemical reactions mostly take place. The surface is where\nvaporization or diffusion of substances into the medium occurs. And\nthe surface is where vibrations of the substance are transmitted into\nthe medium. \n\n\nGeorge Spencer-Brown, Laws of Form (1969: 1)\n Distinction is perfect continence. That is to say, a distinction\nis drawn by arranging a boundary with separate sides so that a point\non one side cannot reach the other side without crossing a boundary.\nFor example, in a plane space a circle draws a distinction. \n\n\nMichael Dummett, Frege. Philosophy of Language (1973:\n577) \n The picture of reality as an amorphous lump, not yet articulated\ninto discrete objects, thus proves to be a correct one, so long as we\nmake the right use of it.\n\n\nNelson Goodman, \u2018Notes on the Well-Made World\u2019 (1983:\n104)\n Now as we thus make constellations by picking out and putting\ntogether certain stars rather than others, so we make stars by drawing\ncertain boundaries rather than others. Nothing dictates whether the\nskies shall be marked off into constellations or other objects. We\nhave to make what we find, be it the Great Dipper, Sirius, food, fuel,\nor a stereo system. \n\n\nAlan Sidelle, \u2018Rigidity, Ontology, and Semantic\nStructure\u2019 (1992: 172)\n The world is capable of being cut up in so many ways, and\nwhenever we consider such a cut (some principle of individuation), we\nare considering the world cut that way, i.e., so articulated. An\narticulation will specify both actual conditions which must be met for\nsomething to be (an) F, and identity conditions for tracing Fs through\nspace, time, and possible worlds. If there are portions of the world\nwhich meet the actual conditions, then there are Fs. \n\n\nRoderick Chisholm, \u2018Boundaries as Dependent\nParticulars\u2019 (1984: 88)\n If the continuous object is cut in half, then does the one\nboundary [that demarcates two adjacent parts] become two boundaries,\none thing thus becoming two things? [\u2026] But how can one thing\n\u2014 even if it is only a boundary \u2014 become two things? And\ndoes this mean that when two things become continuous, then two things\nthat had been diverse become identical with each other, two\nthings thus becoming one thing? \n\n\nDavid K. Lewis, The Plurality of Worlds (1986: 212)\n The reason why it\u2019s vague where the outback begins is not\nthat there\u2019s this thing, the outback, with imprecise borders;\nrather there are many things, with different borders, and nobody has\nbeen fool enough to try to enforce a choice of one of them as the\nofficial referent of the word \u2018outback\u2019. \n\n\nMichael Tye, \u2018Vague Objects\u2019 (1990: 535)\n There is no line which sharply divides the matter composing\n[Mount] Everest from the matter outside it. Everest\u2019s boundaries\nare fuzzy. Some molecules are inside Everest and some molecules\noutside. But some have an indefinite status: there is no objective,\ndeterminate fact of the matter about whether they are inside or\noutside. \n\n\nMark Sainsbury, \u2018Concepts without Boundaries\u2019 (1990:\n257)\n A vague concept is boundaryless in that no boundary marks the\nthings which fall under it from the things which do not, and no\nboundary marks the things which definitely fall under it from the\nthings which do not definitely do so; and so on. Manifestations are\nthe unwillingness of knowing subjects to draw any such boundaries, the\ncognitive impossibility of identifying such boundaries, and the\nneedlessness and even disutility of such boundaries. \n\n\nPeter Simons, \u2018Faces, Boundaries, and Thin Layers\u2019\n(1991: 91)\n If a macroscopic body consists of spatially separate particles\n[\u2026] a connected boundary would need to bridge the gaps between\nthe [particles] and thus would be both am \u2018imaginary\u2019\nrather than real entity (like saying a fakir bed of nails has a flat\ntop) and to some extent arbitrary (like the curves scientists draw\nthrough the scattered and inexact data to give a smooth graph). \n\n\nEviatar Zerubavel, The Fine Line (1991: 5)\n We transform the natural world into a social one by carving out\nof it mental chunks we then treat as if they were discrete, totally\ndetached from their surroundings. The way we mark off islands of\nproperty is but one example of the general process by which we create\nmeaningful social entities. \n\n\nCatherine Elgin, \u2018Unnatural Science\u2019 (1995: 297)\n Our parochial concerns pretty clearly influence our choice of\ncategories for macroscopic objects and kinds. [\u2026] It would be\nrather remarkable if, for example, a taxonomy that draws the\ndistinction between horses and zebras where we do aligned at all well\nwith natural categories suitable for describing the cosmos as a whole,\nbut indifferent to human faculties and ends. \n\n\nBarry Smith, \u2018On Drawing Lines on a Map\u2019 (1995:\n479)\n The interiors of fiat objects are [\u2026] autonomous portions\nof autonomous reality. Only the respective external boundaries are\ncreated by us; it is these which are the products of our mental and\nlinguistic activity, and of associated conventional laws, norms and\nhabits. \n\n\nBarry Smith, \u2018On Substances, Accidents and Universals\u2019\n(1997b: 122)\n Delineation is, be it noted, an immensely powerful faculty of\ncognition; the scope of delineatory intentionality, the effortlessness\nwith which we can comprehend highly complex wholes \u2014 which may\nbe scattered throughout the length and breadth of the universe, in\nboth space and time \u2014 with a simple delineatory act (\u2018the\nlegacy of the Renaissance\u2019, \u2018the Austro-Hungarian Empire\nand its successor states\u2019, \u2018English poetry\u2019) is\nwondrous to behold, and bears comparison with the magic of\nsingle-rayed intentionality, whereby, on the basis of a list of\nentries which might be drawn up entirely at random, we can be\ndirected, in succession, to mountains in Siberia, teapots in Halifax,\nand black holes in the galaxy of Mog. \n\n\nRaviel Netz, 2009, Barbed Wire (2009: xi)\n Define, on the two-dimensional surface of the earth, lines across\nwhich motion is to be prevented, and you have one of the key themes of\nhistory. With a closed line (i.e., a curve enclosing a figure), and\nthe prevention of motion from outside the line to its inside, you\nderive the idea of property. With the same line, and the prevention of\nmotion from inside to outside, you derive the idea of prison. With an\nopen line (i.e., a curve that does not enclose a figure), and the\nprevention of motion in either direction, you derive the idea of\nborder. Properties, prisons, borders: it is through the prevention of\nmotion that space enters history. \n\n\nGloria E. Anzald\u00faa, Borderlands/La Frontera (1987:\n3)\n Borders are set up to define the places that are safe and unsafe,\nto distinguish us from them. A border is a dividing\nline, a narrow strip along a steep edge. A borderland is a vague and\nundetermined place created by the emotional residue of an unnatural\nboundary. It is in a constant state of transition. The prohibited and\nforbidden are its inhabitants. Los atravesados live here: the\nsquint-eyed, the perverse, the queer, the troublesome, the mongrel,\nthe mulato, the half-breed, the half dead; in short, those who cross\nover, pass over, or go through the confines of the\n\u2018normal\u2019. \n\n\nSally Haslanger, \u2018Feminism in Metaphysics: Negotiating the\nNatural\u2019 (2000: 116; 2012: 148\u2013149)\n [T]here is an unmistakable pattern of projecting onto women and\npeople of color, as their \u2018nature\u2019 or as\n\u2018natural\u2019, features that are instead (if manifested at\nall) a product of social forces. This projective error has led\nfeminists to be extremely suspicious of natural kinds and objective\ntypes: if one function of references to \u2018nature\u2019 or\n\u2018natures\u2019 is to mark the boundaries of what is socially\npossible, thereby \u2018justifying\u2019 pernicious institutions, we\nmust be wary of the suggestion that any category is\n\u2018natural\u2019. [\u2026] Is there any meaningful (and\npolitically viable) distinction between the natural and the social,\nand if so, where does the line fall?

If so, how? \n\n\nSarah Green, \u2018A Sense of Border\u2019 (2012: 580)\n While it is clear that borders do not independently exist as\nself-evident entities in the landscape [\u2026] it is also the case\nthat once constructed (which includes all the various associated\nbordering practices, both formal and informal), borders can take on\nthing-like qualities, both in practice and in people\u2019s\nimaginations. \n\n\nJody Azzouni, Ontology without Borders (2017: 143)\n [T]here are no worldly ontological borders between purported\nobjects; there are no properties, no relations \u2014 no aspects of\nanything in the world \u2014 that constitute or amount to\nworldly individuation conditions for objects [\u2026] we project\nobject boundaries onto the world. \n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abasnezhad, A., and Hosseini, D., 2014, \u2018Vagueness in the\nWorld: A Supervaluationist Approach\u2019, in K.
