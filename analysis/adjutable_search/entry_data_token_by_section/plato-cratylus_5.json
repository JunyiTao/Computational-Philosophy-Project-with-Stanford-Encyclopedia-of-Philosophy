    "main_text": "Hermogenes\u2019 Conventionalism (383a\u2013386e) || Conventionalism and Relativism\n3.3 Conventionalism and Relativism\n\nOnce Socrates\u2019 has drawn the conclusion that \u201cit is\npossible to say a true and a false name\u201d, Hermogenes reaffirms\nhis conventionalist position loudly and clearly (385d\u2013e).\nSocrates proceeds to inquire whether Hermogenes accepts\nProtagoras\u2019 claim that \u201chowever the objects appear to me\nto be, such they are for me\u201d (385e\u2013386a). This is a\nradical claim, entailing that objects have their properties in a\nsubject-dependent manner: that it only makes sense to ask whether it\nis the case for some subject S that an object\nO has property P, but not whether it is objectively\nthe case that O has P. Hermogenes admits that he\nfound this relativist outlook tempting at some point, but is\nnevertheless unwilling to adopt it (386a). Socrates then presents an\nargument against relativism: Since there are both virtuous and wicked\npersons, and since virtuous persons are wise and wicked persons\nunwise, Protagoras cannot be right in saying that no one is ever wrong\nabout anything (386a\u2013e). A very similar argument is found to be\nwanting in the Theaetetus (166d\u2013167d). But here in the\nCratylus, Socrates is happy to conclude from his reflections\nthat \u201cobjects have some stable being of their own\u201d (386e).\nHe thus asserts that objects have their properties in a\nsubject-independent manner: that it makes sense to ask whether a\nsubject S is objectively right or objectively wrong in\nbelieving that an object O has property P.\n\nIt is not clear why Socrates discusses Protagorean relativism with\nHermogenes. Commentators used to think that he does this because\nHermogenes defends an \u201canything goes\u201d conventionalism that\nhas relativist implications (see, e.g., Mackenzie 1986: 129; Palmer\n1988: 44\u201350; and Silverman 1992: 31\u201334); but as has been\nnoted, Hermogenes\u2019 position is in fact a very sensible one. If\nthere really is a connection between Hermogenes\u2019 conventionalism\nand Protagorean relativism, it must thus be of a more indirect nature\n(Barney 1997: 156\u2013162; Mei\u00dfner 2021). It has also been\nargued, however, that Plato has Socrates discuss relativism with\nHermogenes to prevent misunderstandings and show that conventionalism\nabout names has nothing to do with relativism (Ademollo 2011:\n80f.).\n",
