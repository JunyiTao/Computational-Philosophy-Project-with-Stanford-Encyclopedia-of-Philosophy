    "main_text": "The Place of Hegel\u2019s Social and Political Thought || Systematic and Non-Systematic Readings\n1.3 Systematic and Non-Systematic Readings\n\nMore recently, scholars have focused on a core contention between\nmetaphysical and non-metaphysical readings about what relation, if any,\nHegel\u2019s PR has to his wider philosophical system. Most\nnon-metaphysical readings interpret the PR independently of\nHegel\u2019s system whereas all metaphysical readings attempt to\nsituate the PR within Hegel\u2019s system. Viewing the debate\nfrom this perspective, the core contention is not about the place of\nmetaphysics but the interpretive place of any work within the\nsystem.\n\nA non-systematic reading interprets Hegel\u2019s PR\nexplicitly separately from his wider system. This view has few\nadherents. It runs clearly against Hegel\u2019s own self-understanding\nstated in the PR\u2019s Preface where he says the PR\n\u201cis a more extensive, and in particular a more systematic,\nexposition of the same basic concepts which, in relation to this part\nof philosophy, are already contained in a previous work designed to\naccompany my lectures, namely my Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical\nSciences\u201d (PR, p. 9). The PR is explicit\nthat it serves as an elaboration of the section \u201cObjective\nSpirit\u201d within his philosophical system, and so a part of it.\n\nThe now orthodox view is the systematic reading which accepts that\nHegel\u2019s logic and system have explanatory force in interpreting\nthe PR (Brooks 2013). There is no denying their connection,\nonly its character and strength. There remain differences about how\nmuch the system does or should figure as well as related metaphysical\nissues (Wood 2017). For example, there is a\nconsensus that Hegel\u2019s political philosophy should be understood\nwithin its systematic context, but there remains disagreement about\nwhether we need to accept his arguments for the wider philosophical\nsystem in order to accept his contributions to political philosophy.\nThis entry will broadly follow the dominant systematic reading, but\nacknowledges there is not a consensus on how strongly a justificatory\nrole the system plays for his political thought.\n",
