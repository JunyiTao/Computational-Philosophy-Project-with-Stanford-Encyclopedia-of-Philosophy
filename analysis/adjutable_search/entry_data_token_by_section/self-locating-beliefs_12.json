    "main_text": "Self-Location in Language || The package-delivery model of communication\n5.1 The package-delivery model of communication\n\nMost of the literature around self-locating communication presupposes\na Lewisian account on which what\u2019s distinctive about\nself-locating beliefs is their distinctively self-locating content. In\nwhat follows, we\u2019ll try to remain neutral between Lewisian,\ncontent-based accounts and Perry-style\nvehicle/mechanism/mode-of-presentation based accounts. To do this,\nwe\u2019ll need to introduce a bit of stipulatively defined technical\nvocabulary.\n\nWe will talk, for example, about John\u2019s self-locating\ndoxastic state when he\u2019s disposed to sincerely say,\n\u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d\u2014this is the state that\nmarks him off as doxastically similar to others who are also disposed\nto say \u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d (and to search their own\ngrocery carts for sources of mess), and as doxastically different from\nhis pre-cottoning-on self. We\u2019ll use \u201cdoxastic\nstate\u201d in a way that\u2019s deliberately neutral between\nstanding in the belief relation to a distinctively self-locating\ncontent, as Lewis would have it, or instead being in a particular\nPerry-style belief-state, such that different subjects, when in that\nbelief-state, are thereby belief-related to different traditional\npropositions. We want to use \u201cdoxastic state\u201d to talk\nabout the cognitive states that Lewis and Perry both target with their\ntheories, without taking a stand on who\u2019s offering the right\ntheoretical account of those states.\n\nWe\u2019ll follow Perry in using English sentences to identify\nparticular such doxastic states. So, for example, the \u201cmy pants\nare on fire\u201d doxastic state is the cognitive state underwriting\ndispositions to sincerely assert \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d,\nto seek out fire extinguishers and turn them on one\u2019s lower\nparts, etc., which according to Perry is a matter of being in a\nbelief-state whose character mirrors that of the English sentence, and\naccording to Lewis is a matter of standing in the belief relation to\nthe property one needs to instantiate in order to speak truly with the\nsentence, given the sentence\u2019s actual character (or standing in\nthe belief relation to the corresponding centered-worlds\nproposition).\n\nWe can also extend the distinction between boring and\ninteresting centered contents from\n section 3.1\n to doxastic states\u2014this will be useful in what follows. A\nboring doxastic state is one that might as well be a state of\nbelieving a traditional proposition. For Lewis, it\u2019ll be a state\nof believing a boring centered proposition or its corresponding\nworld-occupancy property. For Perry, it\u2019ll be a matter of being\nin a belief-state with constant character\u2014one that always\nrelates its bearers to the same traditional proposition. We identify\nthese doxastic states using context-insensitive English sentences (for\nexample, the \u201cJohn is in Palo Alto\u201d belief-state).\nInteresting (or interestingly self-locating) doxastic states are ones\nthat aren\u2019t boring. We identify these states using\ncontext-sensitive English sentences, such as \u201cI am in Palo\nAlto\u201d. For Lewis, these states belief-relate an agent to an\ninteresting centered proposition, or its corresponding interesting\nproperty. For Perry, these are belief-states that don\u2019t always\nrelate their bearers to the same traditional proposition.\n\nSo much for terminological stipulations. On to a model of\ncommunication that looks attractive when applied to non-self-locating\nbelief, but which doesn\u2019t straightforwardly generalize.\n\nFrom a very high altitude, linguistic communication (or at least, the\nlarge part of it that\u2019s concerned with the transmission of\ninformation) does this: I\u2019m in some doxastic state, and I want\nto get you into some appropriately matching doxastic state. Somehow or\nother, I use a linguistic signal to get you to adopt a doxastic state\nthat matches mine.\n\nWhen we\u2019re not dealing with self-location, it\u2019s extremely\nnatural to model communication by reading the \u201cappropriate\nmatch\u201d in this story as identity. On this model, assertion works\nas follows: I\u2019m in some doxastic state that, for one reason or\nanother, I\u2019d like you to be in as well. So I encode my doxastic\nstate linguistically somehow, and send the linguistic signal over to\nyou. Then (if all goes well) you respond to the signal I sent by\ngetting yourself into the same doxastic state that I encoded. This is\na tractable, simple picture of communication, according to which\nlinguistic communication (or at least this part of it) is a matter of\ntransmitting doxastic states from speaker to hearer. Moss (2012) calls\nthis the \u201cpackage delivery\u201d model, Egan (2007) calls it\nthe \u201cbelief transfer\u201d model, and Weber (2013) calls it the\n\u201cFedEx\u201d model. (Or rather, this is a generalization of the\nmodel described by Egan, Moss, and Weber, theoretically zoomed out to\nbe neutral between Lewis and Perry. Egan, Moss, and Weber all\npresuppose a Lewisian picture in their papers.) The model is nicely\nvisualized by the following cartoon from Weber (2013: 208):\n\n\n\u00a9 2013 Springer Nature, reproduced with permission.\n\n\nWeber also helpfully breaks up the model into two principles: the\nmind-to-speech principle, according to which what\u2019s\nlinguistically expressed is the same as what\u2019s in the (sincere)\nspeaker\u2019s mind, and the speech-to-mind principle, according to\nwhich what winds up in the (credulous) addressee\u2019s mind is the\nsame as what\u2019s linguistically expressed. We are, in what\nfollows, going to focus exclusively on the relation between\ndoxastic states of sincere speakers and credulous addressees.\nWe will suppress, as much as possible, discussion of the precise\nrelations between speaker/addressee doxastic states and the linguistic\ncommunication mechanisms that serve to coordinate them.\n\nSo, in particular, we will suppress questions about the relation\nbetween the compositional semantic values of natural language\nsentences in context and the doxastic states of sincere speakers and\ncredulous addressees. We\u2019ll do this not because we find the\nissues unimportant or uninteresting\u2014quite the contrary! Rather,\nwe want to avoid swimming into deep waters about exactly what the\nrelevant communication-supporting relations are, what they have to do\nwith semantics, etc., and also to keep the discussion at a level of\nabstraction compatible with as many particular theories of the\nphenomena as possible. (See Stanley 1997, 2002; Yalcin 2007; Ninan\n2010a, 2012a; and Rabern 2012, 2017 for some exploration of those deep\nwaters, and see for example Egan, Hawthorne, & Weatherson 2005;\nEgan 2007, 2010, 2012; Stalnaker 2008, 2011; Feit 2008; Torre 2010;\nNinan 2010b, Stojanovic 2012; Moss 2012; Kindermann 2012, 2016, 2019;\nWeber 2013, 2015; K\u00f6lbel 2013; and Recanati 2016 for less cagey\nand more committal discussions of these issues around self-locating\ncommunication.)\n",
