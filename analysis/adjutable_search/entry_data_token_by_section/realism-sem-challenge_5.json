    "main_text": "The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism || Models and Reality\n3.4 Models and Reality\n\nPutnam\u2019s Model-Theoretic Argument is the most technical of the\narguments we have so far considered although we shall not reproduce\nall the technicalities here. The central ideas can be conveyed\ninformally, although some technical concepts will be mentioned where\nnecessary. The argument purports to show that the Representation\nProblem\u2014to explain how our mental symbols and words get hooked\nup to mind-independent objects and how our sentences and thoughts\ntarget mind-independent states of affairs\u2014is insoluble.\n\nAccording to the Model-Theoretic Argument, there are simply too many\nways in which our mental symbols can be mapped onto items in the\nworld. The consequence of this is a dilemma for the realist. The first\nhorn of the dilemma is that s/he must accept that what our symbols\nrefer to is massively indeterminate. The second horn is that s/he must\ninsist that even an ideal theory, whose terms and predicates can\ndemonstrably be mapped veridically onto objects and properties in the\nworld might still be false, i.e., that such a mapping might not be the\nright one, the one \u2018intended\u2019.\n\nNeither alternative can be defended, according to anti-realists.\nConcerning the first alternative, massive indeterminacy for perfectly\ndeterminate terms is absurd. As for the second, for realists to\ncontend that even an ideal theory could be false is to resort to\nunmotivated dogmatism, since on their own admission we cannot tell\nwhich mapping the world has set up for us. Such dogmatism leaves the\nrealist with no answer to a skepticism which undermines any capacity\nto reliably represent the world, anti-realists maintain.\n\nNow, in logic theories are treated as sets of sentences and the\nobjects (if any) that sentences talk about appear as elements of the\ndomain of set-theoretic entities called structures. Associated\nwith these structures are interpretation functions that map\nindividual constants onto individual objects of the domain and n-place\npredicates onto n-tuples of elements in the domain. When a structure\nmakes all the sentences of a given theory true it is called a\nmodel of the theory. By demonstrating that there is a model of\nT we show theory T is consistent. If T turns out to be true in its\nintended model, then T is true simpliciter. \n\n\nFor an informal illustration of the basic ideas of model theory, see\nthe supplementary document,\n Model Theory: Core Ideas.\n \n\n\nLet us call structures whose domains consist of numbers\n\u2018numeric\u2019 structures. The nub of Putnam\u2019s\nModel-Theoretic Argument against realism is that the realist cannot\ndistinguish the intended model for his/her total theory of the world\nfrom non-standard interlopers such as permuted models or ones derived\nfrom numeric models, even when total theory is a rationally optimal\none that consists, as it must do, of an infinite set of\nsentences and the realist is permitted to impose the most exacting\nconstraints to distinguish between models. This is a very surprising\nresult if true! How does Putnam arrive at it? \n\nPutnam actually uses a number of different arguments to establish the\nconclusion above. Of prime concern to realists, as Taylor (2006)\nemphasises, is the argument based on G\u00f6del\u2019s Completeness\nTheorem, GCT. For, following Lewis [Lewis, 1984], realists might\nconcede to Putnam that they cannot single out the intended model or\ndistinguish it from various ersatz models, but argue that this is not\nnecessary since it suffices that an intended model exists,\neven if we cannot specify it. This response does not answer the GCT\nargument, however. For this argument purports to prove directly that\nan ideal theory of the world could not be false, a conclusion flatly\ninconsistent with realism. See the supplementary document\n The Model-Theoretic Argument and the Completeness Theorem\n for an outline of this argument. \n\nPutnam has another argument, the Permutation Argument:\n\nSuppose that the realist is able to somehow specify the intended\nmodel. Call this intended model \\(W''\\). Then nothing the realist can\ndo can possibly distinguish \\(W''\\) from a permuted variant \\(W^*\\)\nwhich can be specified following Putnam 1994b, 356\u2013357:\n\nWe define properties of being a cat* and being a mat* such that:\n\n\nIn the actual world cherries are cats* and trees are mats*.\nIn every possible world the two sentences \u201cA cat is on a\nmat\u201d and \u201cA cat* is on a mat*\u201d have precisely the\nsame truth value.\n\n\n\nInstead of considering two sentences \u201cA cat is on a mat\u201d\nand \u201cA cat* is on a mat*\u201d now consider only the one\n\u201cA cat is on a mat\u201d, allowing its interpretation to change\nby first adopting the standard interpretation for it and then adopting\nthe non-standard interpretation in which the set of cats* are assigned\nto \u2018cat\u2019 in every possible world and the set of mats* are\nassigned to \u2018mat\u2019 in every possible world. The result will\nbe the truth-value of \u201cA cat is on a mat\u201d will not change\nand will be exactly the same as before in every possible world.\nSimilar non-standard reference assignments could be constructed for\nall the predicates of a language. [See Putnam 1985, 1994b.] However,\nunlike the GCT argument, the Permutation Argument is susceptible to\nthe Lewis-styled reply above.\n",
