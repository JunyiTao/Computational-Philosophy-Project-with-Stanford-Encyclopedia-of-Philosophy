    "main_text": "Natural Theology || Divine infinity and the doctrine of univocity\n2.3 Divine infinity and the doctrine of univocity\n\nIn laying out Scotus\u2019s proof of the existence of God, I passed\nrather quickly over the claim that God is infinite. But the divine\ninfinity deserves more detailed treatment. As we have already seen,\nthe concept of \u201cinfinite being\u201d has a privileged role in\nScotus\u2019s natural theology. As a first approximation, we can say\nthat divine infinity is for Scotus what divine simplicity is for\nAquinas. It\u2019s the central divine-attribute generator. But there\nare some important differences between the role of simplicity in\nAquinas and the role of infinity in Scotus. The most important, I\nthink, is that in Aquinas simplicity acts as an ontological spoilsport\nfor theological semantics. Simplicity is in some sense the key thing\nabout God, metaphysically speaking, but it seriously complicates our\nlanguage about God. God is supposed to be a subsistent simple, but\nbecause our language is all derived from creatures, which are all\neither subsistent but complex or simple but non-subsistent, we\ndon\u2019t have any way to apply our language straightforwardly to\nGod. The divine nature systematically resists being captured in\nlanguage.\n\nFor Scotus, though, infinity is not only what\u2019s ontologically\ncentral about God; it\u2019s the key component of our best available\nconcept of God and a guarantor of the success of theological language.\nThat is, our best ontology, far from fighting with our theological\nsemantics, both supports and is supported by our theological\nsemantics. The doctrine of univocity rests in part on the claim that\n\u201c[t]he difference between God and creatures, at least with\nregard to God\u2019s possession of the pure perfections, is\nultimately one of degree\u201d (Cross [1999], 39). Remember one of\nScotus\u2019s arguments for univocity. If we are to follow Anselm in\nascribing to God every pure perfection, we have to affirm that we are\nascribing to God the very same thing that we ascribe to\ncreatures: God has it infinitely, creatures in a limited way. One\ncould hardly ask for a more harmonious cooperation between ontology\n(what God is) and semantics (how we can think and talk about him).\n\nScotus ascribes to Aquinas the following argument for the divine\ninfinity: If a form is limited by matter, it is finite. God, being\nsimple, is not limited by matter. Therefore, God is not finite. This,\nas Scotus points out, is a fallacious argument. (It\u2019s an\ninstance of denying the antecedent.) But even apart from the fallacy,\nsimplicity is not going to get us infinity. As Scotus puts it:\n\u201cif an entity is finite or infinite, it is so not by reason of\nsomething accidental to itself, but because it has its own intrinsic\ndegree of finite or infinite perfection\u201d (Ordinatio 1,\nd. 1, pars 1, q. 1\u20132, n. 142). So simplicity does not entail\ninfinity, because finitude is not the result of composition. To look\nat it another way, Aquinas\u2019s conception of infinity is\nnegative and relational. The infinite is that which\nis not bounded by something else. But Scotus thinks we can\nhave a positive conception of infinity, according to which infinity is\nnot a negative, relational property, but instead a positive, intrinsic\nproperty. It is an \u201cintrinsic degree of perfection.\u201d\n\nHow do we acquire that conception of positive, intrinsic infinity? The\nstory goes like this. We begin with \u201cthe potentially infinite in\nquantity.\u201d According to Aristotle, you can never have an actual\nquantitative infinity, since no matter how great a quantity you have,\nyou can always have more. What you can have (and in fact do have,\nAristotle thinks) is a quantitative infinity by successive parts. The\nnext step is to imagine that all the parts of that quantitative\ninfinity remained in existence simultaneously. That is, we imagine an\nactual quantitative infinity. Scotus then asks us to shift from\nthinking about an actual quantitative infinity to thinking about an\nactual qualitative infinity. Think of some quality (say,\ngoodness) as existing infinitely: so that there is, as it were, no\nmore goodness that you could add to that goodness to make it any\ngreater. That\u2019s infinite goodness. But notice that you\ncan\u2019t think of infinite goodness as in some way composed of\nlittle goodness-bits (just an infinite number of them). If I say that\nan angel is better than a human being, I can\u2019t mean that a human\nbeing has a certain number of goodness-bits while the angel has that\nmany plus some extras. Rather, the specific degree of goodness of a\nthing is just an intrinsic, non-quantitative feature of that thing.\nInfinite being is just like that. Scotus describes it as \u201ca\nmeasure of intrinsic excellence that is not finite.\u201d This is why\nthe concept of \u201cinfinite being\u201d is the simplest concept\navailable to us for understanding God. Infinity is not some sort of\naccidental addition to being, but an intrinsic mode of being. Of\ncourse, if this is right, then the concepts of \u2018infinite\ngoodness\u2019, \u2018infinite power\u2019, and so forth, are every\nbit as simple as the concept of \u2018infinite being\u2019. So why\ndoes Scotus make such a big deal about \u2018infinite being\u2019?\nBecause \u2018infinite being\u2019 \u201cvirtually contains\u201d\nall the other infinite perfections of God. That is, we can deduce the\nother infinite perfections from infinite being. So besides being the\nnext best thing to a simple concept, it\u2019s the most theoretically\nfruitful concept we can have of God in this life.\n",
