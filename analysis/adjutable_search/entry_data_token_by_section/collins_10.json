    "main_text": "Collins, Deism and Freethinking || Analogical language\n4.2 Analogical language\n\nIn A Vindication of the Divine Attributes, in some Remarks on His\nGrace the Archbishop of Dublin\u2019s sermon intitled \u201cDivine\nPredestination Consistent with the Freedom of Man\u2019s\nWill\u201d, (published in 1710) Collins takes on another way of\nevading his demand that whatever we believe must be comprehensible to\nus. This is the doctrine of analogy that goes back to St. Thomas\nAquinas. The form in which Collins finds it in the works of Archbishop\nKing of Dublin, is the doctrine that not only does God not have hands\nand feet and a beard in a literal sense, he does not have wisdom,\nbenevolence or justice in any sense that we can understand these\nterms. Thus King remarked: \n\n\nIt does not follow from hence, that any of these are more properly or\nliterally in God after the manner they are in us, than hands or eyes,\nthan mercy, than love or hatred are. \n\n\nCollins rejects the claim that God\u2019s wisdom and benevolence\ncould have meanings that we do not comprehend. He asserts that\nGod\u2019s knowledge and his attributes are univocal with ours\n(O\u2019Higgins 1970: 63).\n\nDavid Berman in his A History of Atheism in Great Britain,\ngives a number of reasons to take Collins as an atheist rather than a\ndeist. He sees Collins\u2019 account of the creation of matter ex\nnihilo in the Answer to Mr. Clarke\u2019s Third Defence in the\nClarke Collins correspondence as an argument for atheism disguised as\nan argument against atheism (Berman 1988: 80\u201381). He sees\nCollins as using Bayle to raise the problem of evil in the\nVindication of the Divine Attributes and then showing that\nboth the solution offered by Bayle and Dr. King are unacceptable.\nCollins\u2019 official position at the end of the\nVindication is that King is wrong but atheism is avoidable.\nBerman asks what the actual conclusion of the Vindication is.\nHe continues:\n\n\nIt is simply that there are very formidable, or insuperable,\ndifficulties in the theistic conception of God\u2014revealed by the\nManichean problems\u2014and that the latest attempt to cope with, or\nsolve, these difficulties, i.e. King\u2019s theory, has failed; for\nthe medicine is as bad as the disease. But the disease remains!\n(Berman 1988: 84)\n\n\nCollins clearly rejects theism based on revelation. But one could also\nbe a theist based on arguments from natural religion. Berman sees the\nVindication as aimed at the heart of natural religion (1988:\n84). If this were so, we would have good reason to regard Collins as\nan atheist. On the one hand, Collins\u2019 position about analogical\nlanguage may seem to strongly support natural religion. Insofar as the\nmeaning of the divine attributes is univocal with our use of the same\nwords about human beings, the analogy that natural religion relies on\nwould work at its best. (The basic analogy on which natural religion\ndepends is that humans are to the machines they make as God is to the\nworld.) Archbishop King\u2019s position, on the other hand, would\ncompletely undermine the analogy. There is, however, a second\nconsideration. Insofar as the problem of evil is left unresolved in\nnatural religion, it would suggest that it can provide no effective\nanswer to this fundamental difficulty in theism. This is\nBerman\u2019s point. O\u2019Higgins, by contrast, claims that in the\nVindication Collins simply sets aside the problem of evil\n(O\u2019Higgins 1970: 63).\n",
