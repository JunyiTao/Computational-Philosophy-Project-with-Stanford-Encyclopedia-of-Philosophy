    "main_text": "Modern Aesthetics and the Problem of Erotic Art || The Aesthetic Disenfranchisement of the Erotic\n2.1 The Aesthetic Disenfranchisement of the Erotic\n\nModern aesthetics famously built a wall between aesthetic pleasure, on\nthe one hand, and sensual or sexual pleasures, on the other hand,\nleaving precious little room for works that aim to combine the two.\nThe problem becomes clear when we consider Immanuel Kant\u2019s\nCritique of Judgment (1790), arguably the most central and\ninfluential work of that period. According to Kant, a pure aesthetic\njudgment is based entirely on a feeling of disinterested pleasure,\ni.e., a pleasure that does not depend on or generate a desire for the\nobject. But since works of erotic art are meant precisely to tap into\nand stimulate our sexual appetites and desires, it is hard to see how\nthey can be the object of an aesthetic judgment. They are rather\nprimed to be the object of what Kant calls a judgment of the\nagreeable, based on an \u201cinterested pleasure\u201d, in this case\nthe titillation provided by the alluring depictions of attractive\nbodies and seductive poses. The sensual pleasure offered by such\nrepresentations is very different from the enjoyment that occurs in an\naesthetic experience and which results from the free play of the\ncognitive faculties of imagination and understanding. According to\nKant, it is because aesthetic judgments are grounded not in any\ninterest, but rather in the subjective conditions of cognition, which\nare shared by all rational beings, that they can lay claim to\nuniversality. The pleasure solicited by erotic art can obviously not\nlay claim to such universality since it will depend on one\u2019s\nsexual preferences and inclinations.\n\nKant was not the first to introduce disinterestedness as hallmark of\nthe aesthetic and isolate it as such from what is merely sensually or\nsexually appealing. Anthony Ashley Cooper, the third Earl of\nShaftesbury, is often credited with this insight. In his\nCharacteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711)\nShaftesbury already stated that the response solicited by beauty is\none of rational and refined contemplation, far removed from the crude\npleasures that we receive through our senses.\n\nA problem that immediately arises for Shaftesbury\u2019s account is\nthe one posed by the \u201cdazzling form\u201d of a beautiful woman\n(1964 [1711]: 136). Here, beauty and sensual appeal, far from being\nantithetical, actually seem to go hand in hand. Still, Shaftesbury\ninsists that the two kinds of pleasure are utterly distinct, even\nthough, in this particular case, erotic pleasure may indeed follow in\nthe wake of aesthetic pleasure. One could make a comparison, he\nwrites, with someone who goes from contemplating the beauty of a tree\nto fantasizing about its tasty fruits. Both activities are\npleasurable, but the pleasures involved are very different: one is a\ndisinterested aesthetic pleasure, the other is a pleasure informed by\nour self-interest. It points to a sensual joy, based on an appetite\nthat we have in common with animals, or \u201cbrutes\u201d as\nShaftesbury prefers to call them. The contemplation of beauty, by\ncontrast, is unique to us rational beings. That\u2019s because beauty\nis exclusively an object of the mind.\n\nBut can one really draw the distinction in such absolute terms? When\nwe admire an attractive man or woman, isn\u2019t it precisely their\nbeauty that activates the senses and gives rise to certain\nbodily passions? And if so, doesn\u2019t this prove that the two are\nintimately linked? Shaftesbury dismisses this line of thought almost\nout of hand. After all, we wouldn\u2019t say that it is the\nbeauty of the fruit that attracts and brings joy to the\nprowling animal in search of food; or that it is the beauty of the\nfood served at the dinner table that makes us humans hungry. What\nwhets and satisfies appetite of both humans and animals is not the\nstriking form, but what lies beneath that striking form, that which is\nmere matter. (Accordingly, the more a mouthwatering dish or body is\nviewed, the further they are from satisfying by mere view.) Just as it\nis not the material that makes a sculpture beautiful, but rather the\nartistic intentions and designs that shape the material, so it is not\nthe body in itself, something that is mere matter, that is\nbeautiful:\n\n\nWhat is it you admire but mind, or the effect of mind? Tis mind alone\nwhich forms. All which is void of mind is horrid, and matter formless\nis deformity itself. (1964 [1711]: 132)\n\n\nMind is the only true object of beauty. Moreover, it is only\nthrough the mind that beauty can be apprehended and\nappreciated, for if animals can\u2019t know and enjoy beauty\nprecisely because they have only senses, it follows that man\ncan\u2019t conceive or enjoy beauty through his senses (the\n\u201cbrutish part\u201d).\n\nIt is evident that, for Shaftesbury, erotic art, which is all about\npresenting desirable bodies and stirring up sensual pleasures, can\nhave no legitimate place within the realm of the aesthetic. Yet, apart\nfrom a brief passage in which he denounces the \u201cself-improving\nartist\u201d who makes a fortune by \u201cstudying bodies\u201d\n(1964 [1711]: 144), Shaftesbury does not explicitly criticize or\nattack any kind of art or artist. (Like Kant, his primary focus is not\nart, but beauty.) Someone who does explicitly take up such a critical\nstance, however, is Arthur Schopenhauer. If Shaftesbury is the\nphilosopher who inspired Kant to develop the theory of\ndisinterestedness, then Schopenhauer is the philosopher who, inspired\nby Kant, has taken this notion of disinterestedness and worked it up\ninto a fully-fledged philosophy of art.\n\nThis is not the place to discuss all the minutiae of\nSchopenhauer\u2019s The World as Will and Representation\n(1818). Crucial, for our purposes, is his concept of \u201cdas\nReizende\u201d, which will here be translated as \u201cthe\nstimulating.\u201d The stimulating is \u201cthat which excites the\nwill by directly presenting to it satisfaction, fulfillment\u201d\n(Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207). It ought to be shunned at all price\nin art, says Schopenhauer, because it\n\n\ndraws the beholder down from pure contemplation, demanded by every\napprehension of the beautiful, since it necessarily stirs his will by\nobjects that directly appeal to it. Thus the beholder no longer\nremains pure subject of knowing, but becomes the needy and dependent\nsubject of willing. (Schopenhauer 1969 [1818]: 207)\n\n\nThis is contrary to the aim of art, which is to facilitate will-less\ncontemplation of the Ideas.\n\nSchopenhauer is quite specific about what the stimulating consists\nin:\n\n\nIn historical painting and in sculpture (it) consists in nude figures,\nthe position, semi-drapery, and whole treatment of which are\ncalculated to excite lustful feeling in the beholder. (1969 [1818]:\n207\u20138)\n\n\nIt is important to note that he does not object to depicting the nude\nfigure as such\u2014after all, \u201cthe ancients\u201d did so\n\u201calmost always free from \u2026 fault\u201d (ibid.).\nWhat he objects to is a particular treatment of the nude, one\nwhich is designed to excite lustful feelings in the beholder. In other\nwords, what he targets and denounces is erotic art. Like Shaftesbury\nand Kant he is drawn to make a comparison with food. Fruit is\nadmissible as a subject matter for paintings\n\n\nfor it exhibits itself as a further development of the flower, and as\na beautiful product of nature through form and colour, without our\nbeing positively forced to think of its edibility. (ibid.:\n207\u20138)\n\n\nBut what is not admissible are prepared and served-up dishes, depicted\nwith a high degree of realism. Dutch still life paintings depicting\noysters, herrings, crabs, bread, butter, beer, wine, excite the\nappetite and are objectionable for the exact same reasons as erotic\npaintings and sculptures, which excite sexual appetite, are\nobjectionable: they stimulate the will and as such put an end to any\naesthetic contemplation of the object. Given that the function of art\nis to facilitate aesthetic experience, it follows for Schopenhauer\nthat \u201cthe stimulating \u2026 is everywhere to be avoided in\nart\u201d (ibid: 208; see also Neill 2012).\n",
