    "main_text": "Induction, Necessary Connection, and Laws of Nature\n2. Induction, Necessary Connection, and Laws of Nature\n\nKant formulates a crucial distinction between \u201cstrict\u201d and\n\u201ccomparative\u201d universality in \u00a7 II of the\nIntroduction to the second edition of the Critique\n(B3\u20134):\n\n\nExperience never gives its judgments true or strict, but merely\nassumed or comparative universality (through induction), so\nthat, properly speaking, it must be formulated: so far as we have\nobserved until now, no exception has been found to this or that rule.\nIf, therefore, a judgment is thought with strict universality, i.e.,\nso that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not\nderived from experience, but is valid absolutely a priori. Empirical\nuniversality is thus only an arbitrary augmentation of validity from\nthat which is valid in most cases to that which is valid in\nall\u2014as, e.g., in the proposition: all bodies are heavy. By\ncontrast, where strict universality essentially belongs to a judgment,\nthis [universality] indicates a special source of cognition for [the\njudgment], namely a faculty of a priori cognition. Necessity and\nstrict universality are thus secure criteria of an a priori cognition,\nand also inseparably belong together.\n\n\nKant then explicitly links this distinction to Hume\u2019s discussion\nof causality in the following paragraph (B5): \n\n\nThe very concept of cause so obviously contains the concept of a\nnecessity of the connection with an effect and a strict universality\nof the rule, that the concept [of cause] would be entirely lost if one\npretended to derive it, as Hume did, from a frequent association of\nthat which happens with that which precedes, and [from] a thereby\narising custom (thus a merely subjective necessity) of connecting\n representations.[4]\n\n\n\nMoreover, in the second edition (as we have seen) Kant also goes on to\nname Hume explicitly, as one who attempted to derive the concept of\ncausality \n\n\nfrom a subjective necessity arising from frequent association in\nexperience\u2014i.e., from custom\u2014which is\nsubsequently falsely taken for objective. (B127) \n\n\nIt appears, therefore, that Kant\u2019s discussion, in \u00a7 29 of\nthe Prolegomena, of how, by the addition of the concept of\ncause, we convert a mere subjective \u201cempirical rule\u201d into\nan objective law (which is \u201cnecessary and universally\nvalid\u201d), is not only indebted to Hume for the insight that the\nconnection between cause and effect is synthetic rather than analytic,\nit is also indebted to Hume\u2019s discussions of the problem of\ninduction (in section 4, part 2 of the Enquiry) and of the\nidea of necessary connection (in section 7). Kant agrees with Hume\nthat the idea of necessary connection is in fact an essential\ningredient in our idea of the relation between cause and effect; Kant\nagrees, in addition, that, if all we had to go on were a purely\ninductive inference from observed constant conjunctions, the inference\nfrom comparative to strict universality would not be legitimate, and\nthe presumed necessary connection arising in this way (i.e., from\ncustom) would be merely subjective.\n\nSection 4 of the Enquiry is entitled \u201cSceptical Doubts\nConcerning the Operations of the Understanding\u201d. In part 1 of\nthis section (as we have already seen) Hume maintains that the idea of\nthe effect is never contained in the idea of the cause (in\nKant\u2019s terminology, the relation is not analytic), and thus,\naccording to Hume, it is never knowable a priori. We therefore need\nexperience in the Humean sense in order to make any causal\nclaims\u2014that is, the observation of an event of one type\nA constantly followed by an event of another type B.\nOtherwise (as we have also seen) any event could follow any other (EHU\n4.10; SBN 29): \n\n\nAnd as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in\nall natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience;\nso must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause\nand effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible that\nany other effect could result from the operation of that cause. \n\n\nNote that Hume is here supposing that, in our idea of the relation\nbetween cause and effect, the \u201ctye or connexion \u2026 which\nbinds them together\u201d is necessary (\u201cit is impossible that\nany other effect could result\u201d). In the corresponding section of\nthe Treatise, Book 1, part 3, section 2 (\u201cOf\nprobability; and of the idea of cause and effect\u201d), Hume makes\nthis completely explicit (T 1.3.2.11; SBN 77): \n\n\nShall we then rest contented with these two relations of contiguity\nand succession, as affording a compleat idea of causation? By no\nmeans. An object may be continuous and prior to another, without being\nconsider\u2019d as its cause. There is a NECESSARY CONNEXION to be\ntaken into consideration; and that relation is of much greater\nimportance, than any of the other two above-mention\u2019d.\n\n\nIn the Enquiry, section 4, part 2, Hume presents his famous\nskeptical argument concerning causation and induction. Since we need\n\u201cexperience\u201d (i.e., the observation of constant\nconjunctions) to make any causal claims, Hume now asks (EHU 4.14; SBN\n32): \u201cWhat is the foundation of all conclusions from\nexperience?\u201d The conclusion from an experience of constant\nconjunction is an inference to what has not yet been observed from\nwhat has already been observed, and Hume finds an unbridgeable gap\nbetween the premise (summarizing what we have observed so far) and the\n(not yet observed) conclusion of this inference (EHU 4.16; SBN 34):\n\n\n\nThese two propositions are far from being the same, I have found\nthat such an object has always been attended with such an effect,\nand I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance,\nsimilar, will be attended with similar effects. \n\n\nHume concludes that this inference has no foundation in the\nunderstanding\u2014that is, no foundation in what he calls\n \u201creasoning\u201d.[5]\n How does Hume arrive at this position?\n\nAll our inductive inferences\u2014our \u201cconclusions from\nexperience\u201d\u2014are founded on the supposition that the course\nof nature is sufficiently uniform so that the future will be\nconformable to the past (EHU 4.21; SBN 37\u201338): \n\n\nFor all inferences from experience suppose, as their foundation, that\nthe future will resemble the past \u2026. If there be any suspicion,\nthat the course of nature may change, and that the past may be no rule\nfor the future, all experience becomes useless, and can give rise to\nno inference or conclusion. \n\n\nTherefore, what Hume is now seeking, in turn, is the foundation in our\nreasoning for the supposition that nature is sufficiently uniform.\n\nSection 4, part 1 of the Enquiry distinguishes (as we have\nseen) between reasoning concerning relations of ideas and reasoning\nconcerning matters of fact and existence. Demonstrative reasoning\n(concerning relations of ideas) cannot establish the supposition in\nquestion, \n\n\nsince it implies no contradiction, that the course of nature may\nchange, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have\nexperienced, may be attended with different or contrary effects. (EHU\n4.18; SBN 35) \n\n\nMoreover, reasoning concerning matters of fact and existence cannot\nestablish it either, since such reasoning is always founded on the\nrelation of cause and effect, the very relation we are now attempting\nto found in reasoning (EHU 4.19; SBN 35\u201336): \n\n\nWe have said, that all arguments concerning existence are founded on\nthe relation of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation\nis derived entirely from experience; and that all our experimental\nconclusions proceed upon the supposition, that the future will be\nconformable to the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this\nlast proposition by probable arguments, or arguments regarding\nexistence, must be evidently going in a circle, and taking that for\ngranted, which is the very point in\n question.[6]\n\n\nAlthough Hume has now shown that there is no foundation for the\nsupposition that nature is sufficiently uniform in reasoning or the\nunderstanding, he goes on, in the following section 5 of the\nEnquiry (\u201cSkeptical Solution of these Doubts\u201d),\nto insist that we are nonetheless always determined to proceed in\naccordance with this supposition. There is a natural basis or\n\u201cprinciple\u201d for all our arguments from experience, even if\nthere is no ultimate foundation in reasoning (EHU 5.4\u20135; SBN\n42\u201343):\n\n\nAnd though [one] should be convinced, that his understanding has no\npart in the operation, he would nonetheless continue in the same\ncourse of thinking. There is some other principle, which determines\nhim to form such a conclusion. This principle is CUSTOM or HABIT. For\nwherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a\npropensity to renew the same act or operation, without being impelled\nby any reasoning or process of the understanding; we always say, that\nthis propensity is the effect of Custom. By employing that\nword, we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a\npropensity. We only point out a principle of human nature, which is\nuniversally acknowledged, and which is well known by its\n effects.[7]\n\n\nIn section 7 of the Enquiry (\u201cOn the Idea of Necessary\nConnexion\u201d), after rejecting the received views of causal\nnecessity, Hume explains that precisely this custom or habit also\nproduces our idea of necessary connection (EHU 7.28; SBN 75):\n\n\nIt appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events\narises from a number of similar instances which occur of the constant\nconjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by\nany one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and\npositions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different\nfrom every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar;\nexcept only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is\ncarried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its\nusual attendant, and to believe that it will exist. This connexion,\ntherefore, which we feel in the mind, this customary\ntransition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant,\nis the sentiment or impression, from which we form the idea of power\nor necessary connexion.\n\n\nThus, the custom or habit to make the inductive inference not only\ngives rise to a new idea of not yet observed instances resembling the\ninstances we have already observed, it also produces a feeling of\ndetermination to make the very inductive inference in question. This\nfeeling of determination, in turn, gives rise to a further new idea,\nthe idea of necessary connexion, which has no resemblance whatsoever\nwith anything we have observed. It is derived from an\n\u201cimpression of reflection\u201d (an internal feeling or\nsentiment), not from an \u201cimpression of sensation\u201d (an\nobserved instance before the mind), and it is in precisely this sense,\nfor Hume, that the idea of necessary connection is merely subjective.\nHume emphasizes that this is a \u201cdiscovery\u201d both \u201cnew\nand extraordinary\u201d, and that it is skeptical in character (EHU\n7.28\u201329; SBN 76): \n\n\nNo conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make\ndiscoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of human reason\nand capacity. And what stronger instance can be produced of the\nsurprising ignorance and weakness of the understanding, than the\npresent? For surely, if there be any relation among objects, which it\nimports to us to know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect.\n\n\nKant agrees with Hume that neither the relation of cause and effect\nnor the idea of necessary connection is given in our sensory\nperceptions; both, in an important sense, are contributed by our mind.\nFor Kant, however, the concepts of both causality and necessity arise\nfrom precisely the operations of our understanding\u2014and, indeed,\nthey arise entirely a priori as pure concepts or categories of the\nunderstanding. It is in precisely this way that Kant thinks that he\nhas an answer to Hume\u2019s skeptical problem of induction: the\nproblem, in Kant\u2019s terms, of grounding the transition from\nmerely \u201ccomparative\u201d to \u201cstrict universality\u201d\n(A91\u201392/B123\u2013124). Thus in \u00a7 29 of the\nProlegomena, as we have seen, Kant begins from a merely\nsubjective \u201cempirical rule\u201d of constant conjunction or\nassociation among our perceptions (of heat following illumination by\nthe sun), which is then transformed into a \u201cnecessary and\nuniversally valid law\u201d by adding the a priori concept of\ncause.\n\nAt the end of our discussion in section 1 above we saw that there is a\nserious difficulty in understanding what Kant intends here\u2014a\ndifficulty to which he himself explicitly calls attention. Kant does\nnot think that the particular causal law that \u201cthe sun is\nthrough its light the cause of heat\u201d is itself a synthetic a\npriori truth. Indeed, the very same difficulty is present in our\ndiscussion at the beginning of this section. For, what Kant is saying\nin \u00a7 II of the second edition of the Introduction to the\nCritique is that necessity and strict universality are\n\u201csecure criteria of an a priori cognition\u201d (B4;\nemphasis added). More specifically (B3): \n\n\nExperience in fact teaches us that something is constituted thus and\nso, but not that it cannot be otherwise. Hence, if \u2026 a\nproposition is thought together with its necessity, then it\nis an a priori judgment. \n\n\nYet, once again, Kant does not think that particular causal laws\nrelating specific causes to specific effects are all (synthetic) a\npriori. Accordingly, when Kant provides examples of (synthetic) a\npriori cognitions in the immediately following paragraph, he cites the\nsynthetic a priori principle of the Second Analogy of Experience\n(\u201cAll alterations take place in accordance with the law of the\nconnection of cause and effect\u201d [B232]) rather than any\nparticular causal law (B4\u20135): \n\n\nNow it is easy to show that there actually are such judgments in human\ncognition which are necessary and in the strictest sense universal,\nand therefore purely a priori. If one wants an example from the\nsciences, then one need only take a look at any of the propositions of\nmathematics. If one wants such an example from the most common use of\nthe understanding, then the proposition that every alteration must\nhave a cause can serve.\n\n\nOn the basis of this important passage, among others, the majority of\ntwentieth-century English-language commentators have rejected the idea\nthat Kant has a genuine disagreement with Hume over the status of\nparticular causal laws. One must sharply distinguish between the\ngeneral principle of causality of the Second Analogy\u2014the\nprinciple that every event b must have a cause\na\u2014and particular causal laws: particular instantiations\nof the claim that all events of type A must always be\nfollowed by events of type B. The former is in fact a\nsynthetic a priori necessary truth holding as a transcendental\nprinciple of nature in general, and this principle is explicitly\nestablished in the Second Analogy. But the Second Analogy does not\nestablish, on this view, that particular causal laws are themselves\nnecessary. Indeed, as far as particular causal laws are concerned, the\nSecond Analogy is in basic agreement with Hume: they (as synthetic\na posteriori) are established by induction and by induction\n alone.[8]\n\nIt is indeed crucially important to distinguish between the general\nprinciple of causality Kant establishes in the Second Analogy and\nparticular causal laws. It is equally important that particular causal\nlaws, for Kant, are (at least for the most part) synthetic a\nposteriori rather than synthetic a priori. It does not follow,\nhowever, that Kant agrees with Hume about the status of synthetic a\nposteriori causal laws. On the contrary, Kant (as we have seen)\nclearly states, in \u00a7 29 of the Prolegomena (the very\npassage where he gives his official \u201canswer to Hume\u201d),\nthat there is a fundamental difference between a mere \u201cempirical\nrule\u201d (heat always follows illumination by the sun) and a\ngenuine objective law (the sun is through its light the cause of heat)\narrived at by adding the a priori concept of cause to the merely\ninductive rule. Any law thus obtained is \u201cnecessary and\nuniversally valid\u201d, or, as Kant also puts it, we are now in\npossession of \u201ccompletely and thus necessarily valid\nrules\u201d. In such cases (A91/B124): \n\n\nThe succession is necessary; \u2026 the effect does not\nmerely follow upon the cause but is posited through it and\nfollows from it. The strict universality of the rule is\ncertainly not a property of empirical rules, which, through induction,\ncan acquire nothing but comparative universality: i.e., extensive\nutility. \n\n\nTherefore, it is by no means the case that Kant simply agrees with\nHume that particular causal laws are grounded solely on induction and,\naccordingly, that the necessity we attribute to particular causal\nconnections is merely subjective.\n\nSimilarly, the text of the Second Analogy is also committed to the\nnecessity and strict universality of particular causal laws. If the\ngeneral causal principle (that every event b must have a\ncause a) is true, then, according to Kant, there must also be\nparticular causal laws (relating preceding events of type A\nto succeeding events of type B) which are themselves strictly\nuniversal and\n necessary.[9]\n Kant maintains that, when one event follows another in virtue of a\ncausal relation, it must always follow \u201cin accordance with a\nrule\u201d (A193/B238). Moreover, the \u201crule\u201d to which\nKant is here referring is not the general causal principle, but rather\na particular law connecting a given cause to a given effect which is\nitself strictly universal and necessary (A193/B238\u2013239): \n\n\nIn accordance with such a rule, there must thus lie in that which\nprecedes an event in general the condition for a rule according to which\nthis event follows always and necessarily. \n\n\nKant insists on this point throughout the Second Analogy: \n\n\nthat which follows or happens must follow according to a universal\nrule from that which was contained in the previous state,\n(A200/B245)\n\nin that which precedes the condition is to be met with under which the\nevent always (i.e., necessarily) follows, (A200/B246) \n\n\nand so on. One cannot escape the burden of explaining the apparently\nparadoxical necessity and universal validity of particular (synthetic)\na posteriori causal laws simply by distinguishing them from\nthe general (synthetic) a priori causal principle.\n\nWhat is the relationship, then, between the general causal principle\nof the Second Analogy and the particular causal laws whose existence,\naccording to Kant, is required by the causal principle? What, more\ngenerally, is the relationship between the transcendental synthetic a\npriori principles of the understanding (including all three Analogies\nof Experience\u2014compare the end of\n note 3\n above\u2014as well as the principles corresponding to the other\ncategories) and the more particular synthetic a posteriori laws of\nnature involved in specific causal relationships governing empirically\ncharacterized events and processes? The relationship cannot be\ndeductive; for, if one could deductively derive the particular causal\nlaws from the transcendental principles of the understanding, then the\nformer would have to be synthetic a priori as well.\n\nKant himself discusses this relationship extensively, beginning in the\nfirst edition version of the Transcendental Deduction\n(A126\u2013128):\n\n\nAlthough we learn many laws through experience, these are still only\nparticular determinations of yet higher laws, among which the highest\n(under which all others stand) originate a priori in the understanding\nitself, and are not borrowed from experience, but must rather provide\nappearances with their law-governedness, and precisely thereby make\nexperience possible \u2026 To be sure, empirical laws as such can in\nno way derive their origin from pure understanding\u2014no more than\nthe immeasurable manifold of appearances can be sufficiently\ncomprehended from the pure form of sensibility. But all empirical laws\nare only particular determinations of the pure laws of the\nunderstanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of which\nthey first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform\u2014just as all appearances, notwithstanding the diversity of\ntheir empirical form, still must also always be in accordance with the\ncondition of the pure form of sensibility [i.e., space and time].\n\n\nThe \u201cpure laws of the understanding\u201d (here and elsewhere)\nrefers to the pure transcendental principles of the\nunderstanding characterizing what Kant calls \u201cexperience in\ngeneral\u201d or \u201cnature in general\u201d.\n\nIn the second edition version Kant makes essentially the same point,\nthis time explicitly stating that the relationship in question is not\ndeductive (B165):\n\n\nThe pure faculty of understanding, however, is not sufficient for\nprescribing to appearances a priori, through mere categories, any laws\nother than those which are involved in a nature in general,\nas the law-governedness of all appearances in space and time.\nParticular laws, because they concern empirically determined\nappearances, can not be completely derived therefrom,\nalthough they one and all stand under them. Experience must be added\nin order to become acquainted with the [particular laws] as\nsuch, but only the former laws provide a priori instruction\nconcerning experience in general, and [concerning] that which can be\ncognized as an object of experience.\n\n\nBut what exactly does it mean for particular laws of nature to\n\u201cstand under\u201d the a priori principles of the\nunderstanding\u2014that is, to be what Kant calls \u201cparticular\ndeterminations\u201d of these principles? Once again, it will take\nmore work fully to clarify this relationship, but we can meanwhile\nobserve that it is precisely in virtue of the relationship in question\nthat empirical causal connections\u2014empirical causal laws of\nnature\u2014count as necessary for Kant.\n\nThe necessity in question is characterized in Kant\u2019s official\ndiscussion of the category of necessity in the Postulates of\nEmpirical Thought\u2014the three principles corresponding to the\ncategories of possibility, actuality, and necessity\n(A218\u2013218/B265\u2013266):\n\nThat which agrees with the formal conditions of experience\n(according to intuition and concepts), is possible.\nThat which coheres with the material conditions of experience\n(with sensation), is actual.\nThat whose coherence with the actual is determined in accordance\nwith the general conditions of experience, is (exists as)\nnecessary.\n\n\nThe \u201cformal [or \u201cgeneral\u201d] conditions of\nexperience\u201d include the forms of intuition (space and time),\ntogether with all the categories and principles of the understanding.\nThe material conditions of experience include that which is given to\nus, through sensation, in perception. Kant is thus describing a\nthree-stage procedure, in which we begin with the formal a priori\nconditions of the possibility of experience in general,\nperceive various actual events and processes by means of\nsensation, and then assemble these events and processes\ntogether\u2014via necessary connections\u2014by means of\nthe general conditions of the possibility of experience with which we\nbegan.\n\nIn his detailed discussion of the third Postulate Kant makes it clear\nthat he is referring, more specifically, to causal necessity,\nand to particular (empirical) causal laws\n(A226\u20138/B279\u201380): \n\n\nFinally, as far as the third Postulate is concerned, it\npertains to material necessity in existence, and not the merely formal\nand logical necessity in the connection of concepts. \u2026 Now\nthere is no existence that could be cognized as necessary under the\ncondition of other given appearances except the existence of effects\nfrom given causes in accordance with laws of causality. Thus, it is\nnot the existence of things (substances), but only that of their\nstate, about which we can cognize their necessity\u2014and, indeed,\nfrom other states that are given in perception, in accordance with\nempirical laws of causality. \n\n\nNote that, in this passage, Kant refers to \u201claws of\ncausality\u201d (in the plural) in the second quoted sentence, and\n\u201cempirical laws of causality\u201d (again in the plural) in the\nlast sentence. Hence, he is here referring to particular causal laws\n(of the form every event of type A must always be followed by\nan event of type B) rather than the general principle of the\nSecond Analogy (that every event b must have a cause\n a).[10]\n\nIn the Transcendental Deduction (as we have seen) Kant says that \n\n\nall empirical laws are only particular determinations of the pure laws\nof the understanding, under which and in accordance with the norm of\nwhich they first become possible, and the appearances take on a lawful\nform. (A127\u2013128) \n\n\nIn the discussion of the third Postulate Kant says that we can cognize\nan effect as necessary on the basis of an empirical law\nrelating it to its cause\u2014where the effect\u2019s\n\u201cconnection with the actual is determined in accordance with the\ngeneral conditions of experience\u201d (A218/B266). Kant is\nsuggesting, therefore, that the precise sense in which particular\nempirical laws themselves become necessary is that they, too, are\n\u201cdetermined\u201d in relation to actual perceptions \u201cin\naccordance with the general conditions of experience\u201d (where the\nlatter, of course, essentially include the \u201cpure laws of the\nunderstanding\u201d, i.e., the principles).\n\nThus, in the example from \u00a7 29 of the Prolegomena, Kant\nbegins from a mere \u201cempirical rule\u201d (that heat always\nfollows illumination by the sun) and then proceeds to a\n\u201cnecessary and universally valid\u201d law by adding the a\npriori concept of cause to this (so far) merely inductive rule. The\nvery same three-stage procedure described by the three Postulates as a\nwhole\u2014in which we begin with the formal a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of experience in general, perceive various\nactual events and processes by means of sensation, and then\nassemble these events and processes together (via necessary\nconnections) by means of the a priori conditions of the possibility of\nexperience\u2014also results in \u201cnecessary and universally\nvalid\u201d empirical causal laws of nature (the sun is through its\nlight the cause of heat) governing the events and processes in\nquestion.\n",
