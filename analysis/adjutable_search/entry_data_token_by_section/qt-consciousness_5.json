The basic idea is to conceive of memory\nstates in terms of states of many-particle systems, as inequivalent\nrepresentations of vacuum states of quantum\n fields.[11]\n This proposal has gone through several refinements (e.g., Stuart\net al. 1978, 1979; Jibu and Yasue 1995). Major recent\nprogress has been achieved by including effects of dissipation, chaos,\nfractals and quantum noise (Vitiello 1995; Pessa and Vitiello 2003;\nVitiello 2012). For readable nontechnical accounts of the approach in\nits present form, embedded in quantum field theory as of today, see\nVitiello (2001, 2002).\n\nQuantum field theory (see the entry on\n quantum field theory)\n deals with systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom. For such\nsystems, the algebra of observables that results from imposing\ncanonical commutation relations admits of multiple Hilbert-space\nrepresentations that are not unitarily equivalent to each other. This\ndiffers from the case of standard quantum mechanics, which deals with\nsystems with finitely many degrees of freedom. For such systems, the\ncorresponding algebra of observables admits of unitarily equivalent\nHilbert-space representations.\n\nThe inequivalent representations of quantum field theory can be\ngenerated by spontaneous symmetry breaking (see the entry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking),\n occurring when the ground state (or the vacuum state) of a system is\nnot invariant under the full group of transformations providing the\nconservation laws for the system. If symmetry breaks down, collective\nmodes are generated (so-called Nambu-Goldstone boson modes), which\npropagate over the system and introduce long-range correlations in\nit.\n\nThese correlations are responsible for the emergence of ordered\npatterns. Unlike in standard thermal systems, a large number of bosons\ncan be condensed in an ordered state in a highly stable fashion.\nRoughly speaking, this provides a quantum field theoretical derivation\nof ordered states in many-body systems described in terms of\nstatistical physics. In the proposal by Umezawa these dynamically\nordered states represent coherent activity in neuronal assemblies.\n\nThe activation of a neuronal assembly is necessary to make\nthe encoded content consciously accessible. This activation is\nconsidered to be initiated by external stimuli. Unless the assembly is\nactivated, its content remains unconscious, unaccessed memory.\nAccording to Umezawa, coherent neuronal assemblies correlated to such\nmemory states are regarded as vacuum states; their activation leads to\nexcited states and enables a conscious recollection of the content\nencoded in the vacuum (ground) state. The stability of such states and\nthe role of external stimuli have been investigated in detail by\nStuart et al. (1978, 1979).\n\nA decisive further step in developing the approach has been achieved\nby taking dissipation into account. Dissipation is possible\nwhen the interaction of a system with its environment is considered.\nVitiello (1995) describes how the system-environment interaction\ncauses a doubling of the collective modes of the system in its\nenvironment. This yields infinitely many differently coded vacuum\nstates, offering the possibility of many memory contents without\noverprinting. Moreover, dissipation leads to finite lifetimes of the\nvacuum states, thus representing temporally limited rather than\nunlimited memory (Alfinito and Vitiello 2000; Alfinito et al.\n2001). Finally, dissipation generates a genuine arrow of time for the\nsystem, and its interaction with the environment induces entanglement.\nPessa and Vitiello (2003) have addressed additional effects of chaos\nand quantum noise.\n\nUmezawa\u2019s proposal addresses the brain as a many-particle system\nas a whole, where the \u201cparticles\u201d are more or less\nneurons. In the language of\n Section 3.1,\n this refers to the level of neuronal assemblies, which correlate\ndirectly with mental activity. Another merit of the quantum\nfield theory approach is that it avoids the restrictions of standard\nquantum mechanics in a formally sound way. Conceptually speaking, many\nof the pioneering presentations of the proposal nevertheless confused\nmental and material states (and their properties). This has been\nclarified by Freeman and Vitiello (2008): the model \u201cdescribes\nthe brain, not mental states.\u201d \n\nFor a corresponding description of brain states, Freeman and Vitiello\n2006, 2008, 2010) studied neurobiologically relevant observables such\nas electric and magnetic field amplitudes and neurotransmitter\nconcentration. They found evidence for non-equilibrium analogs of\nphase transitions (Vitiello 2015) and power-law distributions of\nspectral energy densities of electrocorticograms (Freeman and Vitiello\n2010, Freeman and Quian Quiroga 2013). All these observables are\nclassical, so that neurons, glia cells, \u201cand other physiological\nunits are not quantum objects in the many-body model of\nbrain\u201d (Freeman and Vitiello 2008). However, Vitiello (2012)\nalso points out that the emergence of (self-similar, fractal)\npower-law distributions in general is intimately related to\ndissipative quantum coherent states (see also recent developments of\nthe Penrose-Hameroff scenario,\n Section 3.5).\n\nThe overall conclusion is that the application of quantum field theory\ndescribes why and how classical behavior emerges at the level of brain\nactivity considered. The relevant brain states themselves are viewed\nas classical states. Similar to a classical thermodynamical\ndescription arising from quantum statistical mechanics, the idea is to\nidentify different regimes of stable behavior (phases, attractors) and\ntransitions between them. This way, quantum field theory provides\nformal elements from which a standard classical description of brain\nactivity can be inferred, and this is its main role in large parts of\nthe model. Only in their last joint paper, Freeman and Vitiello (2016)\nenvision a way in which the mental can be explicitly included.
