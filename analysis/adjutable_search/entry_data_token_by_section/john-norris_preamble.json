    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Norris (1657 \u2013 1711) continued the broadly Cartesian\nproject in late 17th Century England despite the\never-growing prominence of Lockean empiricism. Norris wrote on\nnumerous topics, including politics, religion, philosophy and the\nChristian life. He also composed poetry. This entry describes several\nof Norris\u2019 most noteworthy advances and insights.\n\nOne important goal of his philosophical writing was the completion of\nMalebranche\u2019s project. Norris believed Malebranche did not prove the\nexistence of the intelligible world, viz. the mind of God. Nor did\nMalebranche offer a full account of the nature of the intelligible\nworld. Norris adopted Descartes\u2019 view of the structure of thought, and\na Malebranchean view of the contents of thought. He also elaborated a\nversion of Descartes\u2019 real distinction proof in order to weaken\nLocke\u2019s thinking matter hypothesis. Proving the existence and\nimmortality of the soul was a prime concern for Norris. Moreover, he\nwas troubled by the heterodox theological views of the Enthusiasts\n(Quakers) and Socinians. He constructed numerous arguments against\ntheir doctrines by utilizing the \u201cdivine light,\u201d\ncharacterized within what he called his \u201cIdeal\nPhilosophy.\u201d\n",
