Different accounts may be suitable to different kinds of\nauthority.  Indeed, different principles grounding authority may be\nsuitable to different kinds of authority.  One thing that is not often\nenough discussed in treatments of political authority is the fact that\nthere are very different kinds of political authority.  Within the\nstate alone there is legislative authority, executive authority,\njudicial authority, and administrative authority; these different\nkinds of authority can have distinct sub-branches of authority.  And\nthere are political authorities outside of the modern state, namely\ninternational institutions.  These have a very distinct kind of\nauthority at least in the contemporary world and the authority of\nthese different agencies is grounded in different principles.\n\n\nAs an illustration of different forms of authority for different\npolitical entities consider the different parts of the modern state.\nWe might think that a democratic legislative assembly has a genuine\nright to rule in the sense that citizens owe obedience to it.  They\nmight owe this obedience because the assembly pools all the democratic\nrights of all the citizens and so citizens treat each other as equals\nby complying with the assembly's directives.  But citizens do not owe\nit to courts to respect their judgments about the law.  The courts may\ncreate duties but the duties are not owed to them.  The same\npresumably goes for policemen and adminstrators as well.  They seem to\nhave moral powers to create duties but these duties are not owed to\nthem.  Furthermore, the grounds of authority might be distinct for\nthese two kinds of entities.  The democratic conception might provide\nthe basis of the authority of the assembly while the authority of\ncourts and administrators may be more instrumentally grounded.\n",
