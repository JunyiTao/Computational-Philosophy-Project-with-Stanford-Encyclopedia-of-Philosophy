    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning: || Why Should Coherence Play a Role in Legal Reasoning?\n3.4 Why Should Coherence Play a Role in Legal Reasoning?\n\n\nOne such argument may well be found in a point already mentioned in\npassing above, i.e. that judges are in a different position from\nlegislators when it comes to deciding how the law ought to be\ndeveloped. Raz (1979 and 1994a) argues that when faced with the choice\nof adopting the (according to law) morally best outcome to a case over\nan outcome which coheres better with the settled law, courts have to\nbear in mind that if they choose the former route, then some\nproblematic consequences may ensue, such as that they may introduce\nconflicting rules reflecting conflicting social and economic purposes\ninto the law, and hence create a considerable degree of dissonance with\nregard to existing legal doctrines in a given area of law. Such\nconsequences need not dog legislative attempts to develop the law in a\nway which deviates from the doctrinal past, because legislative\ninstitutions have the power to sweep away the past in introducing new\nlegislation, and to do so in such a way as to radically reform a whole\narea of law at one stroke. Courts, by contrast, can only make decisions\nconcerning the issues arising in the case before them, and have\nconsiderably less opportunity to engage in radical reform of the law.\nThese factors mean that judicial reform of the law will always be\npartial in nature, and, as was noted above, such partial reform brings\nwith it the possibility of introducing dissonance and conflict into the\nlaw in the meantime. This may provide one reason why sometimes courts\nshould give greater weight to considerations of coherence with\npre-existing law in deciding cases which come before them, rather than\nstriking out in a (albeit otherwise morally preferable) direction which\ncoheres less well with settled law. \n\n\nOn Dworkin's account of adjudication\u2014at least when that account\nis understood as a coherence account (see subsection 3.1 above)\u2014we\nfind a different kind of answer to the question of why coherence has a\nspecial role to play in legal reasoning. As was noted in subsection\n2.4, for Dworkin, in adjudicating cases, judges should seek to\nconstructively interpret the law, i.e. to impose purpose on it in order\nto make of it the best possible example of the form or genre to which\nit is taken to belong (see Dworkin 1986, chs.2 & 3, and the entry\non\n interpretivist theories of law).\n For Dworkin, the form or genre of law is to provide a\nconvincing justification for the exercise of state coercion (see\nDworkin 1986, passim;), and, as\nhe regards both judges and legal theorists as engaging in constructive\ninterpretation (see Dworkin 1986, p90), Dworkin further contends that\nany adequate jurisprudential account of law must explain how what it\ntakes to be law provides a general justification for the exercise of\nthe coercive power of the state (for discussion of this point, see Dickson 2001,\n chs. 5 & 6, Dickson 2004 and cf. the entry on\n interpretivist theories of law). \n In Law's Empire, Dworkin\nargues that such a justification can best be provided when the law is\nviewed as the organised and coherent voice of what he refers to as a\n\u2018community of principle\u2019 i.e. a community whose members\naccept that their fates are linked by virtue of the fact that their\nrights and responsibilities are governed by common principles. So for\nDworkin, we must interpret law as coherent, in the sense of speaking\nwith one voice, because by so doing, we understand law as the voice of\na community of principle, and so as capable of providing a general\njustification for the exercise of state coercion (see Dworkin\n1986).\n\n\nSome theorists are not so concerned to provide a\n\u2018law-specific\u2019 explanation of why coherence has an\nimportant role to play in legal reasoning. For example, although\nacknowledging that there may be much more to be said about what is\ndistinctive about legal reasoning, Hurley 1990 is largely content to\nexplore the consequences for legal reasoning which ensue from the\ncoherentist account of general practical reasoning which she\nespouses.\n",
