    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || Independence from Diagnosis\n5.5 Independence from Diagnosis\n\nJust as it is usually assumed that a patient cannot be declared\nincompetent simply on the basis of her (perhaps unusual) values,\nsimilarly a patient cannot be declared incompetent simply on the basis\nof her diagnosis. For obvious reasons this is most relevant for\npatients with mental illnesses or cognitive impairments, where there\nis a history of assuming that all such patients are globally\nincompetent (Kim 2010: 11). Historically this resulted in large losses\nof freedom for many individuals.\n\nToday it is generally assumed that the diagnosis itself does not mean\na person is\n incompetent.[2]\n Rather, we must look to see if in fact the mental illness (or the\ncognitive impairment) is undermining decision-making capacity for a\nparticular individual and in relation to a particular decision.\nClinicians look for the same features that are supposedly relevant for\nordinary patients: understanding, appreciation, and reasoning, as\ndescribed above (Whiting 2015). This has the result that while some\npatients with a psychiatric diagnosis or a cognitive impairment are\ndeemed incompetent to make some decisions, many are deemed competent\nto make at least some decisions and still others may be deemed\ncompetent to make all of their own decisions. This has had the result\nthat these patient groups have much greater input into their own\ntreatment than in previous eras. Arguably, it has also helped to\ndecrease somewhat the stigma of mental illness and cognitive\nimpairment.\n",
