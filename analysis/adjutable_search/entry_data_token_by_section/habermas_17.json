    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || Other Criticisms\n3.8 Other Criticisms\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s a number of feminist critics, inspired by Carol\nGilligan\u2019s critique of Kohlberg, In a Different Voice,\ndeveloped two significant lines of argument against Kantian moral\ntheory and Rawlsian liberalism. The first was that the\n\u201cliberal\u201d conception of the moral self is formal,\nabstract, and gender-neutral. The second was that the moral self is a\nmale self masquerading as neutral and universal. The suggestion is\nthat morality/moral theory is complicit with discrimination against\nwomen and patriarchal oppression. They aimed a similar criticism at\nKantian, Rawlsian, and Kohlbergian conceptions of \u201cthe moral\nstandpoint\u201d (Benhabib & Cornell [eds] 1987a; Benhabib 1992;\nMeehan [ed.] 1995). Among these feminist critics, some, e.g., Benhabib\nand Meehan, were initially supportive of discourse ethics because of\nits emphasis on including other voices, and its insistence its ideals\nmust be won from the reconstruction of actual practices of real\nagents. Later, their arguments were recalibrated and turned against\ndiscourse ethics. Because the moral self is conceived as formal and\nabstract, and because the moral point of view is characterized by the\nformal criteria of universalizability and reversibility,\nHabermas\u2019s discourse ethics cannot accommodate the kind of moral\nexperiences that, Gilligan maintains, are characteristic of women: it\nis blind to the importance of considerations of care and\nresponsibility for others. This leads Benhabib claims to a\nprivatisation, personalisation, and devaluation of women\u2019s moral\nexperiences (Benhabib & Cornell 1987a: 7\u20139; Benhabib 1992:\n152, 184). She argues further that \u201cthe restriction of the moral\ndomain to questions of justice\u201d results in \u201cthe\nprivatization of women\u2019s experience and leads to epistemological\nblindness towards the concrete other\u201d (Benhabib 1992: 164).\nThere is some doubt whether Benhabib\u2019s position amounts to a\nrefutation of Habermas\u2019s theory or an explication of it. The\nuniversalization procedure imposed by discourse involves participants\nin moral discourse imaginatively switching perspectives with concrete\nother people. If it were not so, if \u201cideal role taking\u201d\ndemanded only that one examined candidate norms from the perspective\nof others generally conceived, there would be nothing to gain from\nsuch a procedure (Finlayson 2013a). It is also unclear, whether such\ncriticisms apply to Habermas\u2019s moral theory, or to the actually\nexisting Kohlbergian \u201cStage 6\u201d morality he takes as its\nobject. Second, it is unclear whether the criticism shows merely that\ndiscourse ethics is a flawed moral theory, or whether it shows that,\nby dint of these flaws, the theory (or the morality it theorizes)\nperpetuates discrimination or oppression against women.\n\nFinally, discourse ethics together with the theory of modernity in\nTheory of Communicative Action has been criticized from an\nanti-colonial perspective. The most sustained and detailed criticism\ncomes from Amy Allen. Noting that Habermas\u2019s argument for\nprinciples (D) and (U) rests on assumptions drawn from modernization\ntheory, she brings the charge of Eurocentrism. Furthermore, building\non criticisms by Dussel (1993) and Bhambra (2011) among others, she\nargues that Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics is wedded to a theory of\nsocial evolution and the idea of modernization as a learning process,\nwhich commits him to a \u201cprogressive view of history\u201d\n(Allen 2016: 72\u20133). In spite of his attempt to deflate the\npresuppositions of the philosophy of history that weighed on Western\nMarxism, Allen and Dussel argue that Habermas\u2019s theory is\nfreighted with a dogmatic Hegelian universalism that in the final\nanalysis asserts the developmental superiority of European\nmodernity.\n",
