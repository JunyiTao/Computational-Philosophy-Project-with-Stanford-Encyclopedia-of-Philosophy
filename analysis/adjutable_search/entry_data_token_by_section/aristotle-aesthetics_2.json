The Poetics: How to Understand Poetry ?\n\nIn these two published works, Aristotle\u2019s primary goal was to\noffer instruction for becoming a sophisticated reader or spectator of\npoetic works. There is no reason why this general aim might have been\ndifferent in the Poetics. This text has often been held,\nsince its rediscovery in the Renaissance, as a manual for a would-be\npoet. And indeed, Aristotle\u2019s tone is often very prescriptive:\nthis \u201cTreatise on the art of composing poetry\u201d seems to\nlay down the rules that one must follow if one wants to write a\nsuccessful play. But Aristotle also says, emphatically, that\n\u201cthe art of poetic composition belongs to a naturally gifted\nman\u201d (17, 1455a32\u201333), and that making good metaphors,\nwhich is the prerogative of a good poet, is \u201csomething that\ncannot be learnt from someone else, but is the sign of natural\ntalent\u201d (22, 1459a4\u20136). It is thus unlikely that Aristotle\nhad the ambition of training poets. Surely, what Aristotle proposes is\nto reconstruct what he takes the best set of composition rules, which\nin his view had helped, or would help, poets write good tragedies. But\nthe exposition of these rules (which the poets may or may not be aware\nof: 8, 1451a23\u201324) is meant to show what good poetry should be\nlike, such that his readers could appreciate the quality of a piece.\nAnd indeed, this is what the conclusion of the Poetics\nstates: \n\n\nThis is all there is to say about tragedy versus epic \u2026 about\nthe reasons why some are good and others not so good\u2026. (26,\n1462b16\u201318) \n\n\nWhat the readers of the Poetics are offered are the reasons\nor causes why such and such feature of a play is to be considered good\nor poor. Armed with such knowledge, they should be better able to\njudge the quality of the tragedies they read or see in the\ntheater.\n\nAs Aristotle posits, notably in the first book of the\nMetaphysics, searching for causes defines philosophical\ninquiry; knowing the cause of x allows you to understand what\nx consists in. And, crucially in Aristotle\u2019s eyes, the\nfinal cause is what matters the most: when one knows the final cause\nof x, one can truly understand not only what x\nconsists in, but should consist in if it is to be the\nx it is supposed to be. More precisely, the end of x\namounts to the ergon, literally, the \u201cwork\u201d or\nthe \u201cactivity\u201d, or what we more usually call the\n\u201cfunction\u201d that x performs; thus, for an eye, its\naim or end amounts to its function, or \u201cfunctioning\u201d (or\n\u201cworking\u201d, energeia) which is, of course, its\nseeing. Similarly, in the case of a hand: its function is grasping\nthings, and when we talk of the hand of a dead body, we use the name\n\u201chand\u201d only homonymously \u2014a dead, non-functioning\nhand is no longer what it is to be a hand, or a \u201creal\u201d\nhand. And when an eye is seeing well, this is what Aristotle calls its\nentelecheia, that is when it performs its telos in a\nperfect (entel\u00eas) way. It is true that in the\nPoetics, we don\u2019t find the typically Aristotelian\ntechnical words energeia and entelecheia. But\npresumably one may take the phrase \u201cthe best tragedy\u201d\n(kallist\u00ea trag\u00f4gia) which is emphatically used in\nPoetics 13 as the equivalent, in common parlance, to a\ntragedy in entelecheia, that is a tragedy that performs its\nfunction, or its telos, in the best possible way. This phrase\ndoes not refer to any particular outstanding tragedy (say,\nSophocles\u2019 Oedipus-Rex, which Aristotle seems to like\nvery much), or to an ideal tragedy that a poet should try to emulate,\nbut rather to any tragedy that would or does indeed fulfill its\nfunction properly.\n\nThis very rough characterization of what the aim and the method of the\nPoetics consist in is in fact announced from its very first\nsentence: \n\n\nThis treatise is about how to compose poetry: what is poetry as such?\nWhat are the poetic genres? What power (dunamis) does each of\nthem have? How should plots be constructed so as to end up with a\nsuccessful work of poetry? How many components should there be, and\nwhat should these components be like? (1, 1447a8\u201311)\n\n\nThis gives us a clear plan of the Poetics, which divides into\ntwo parts: a first part is devoted to poetry \u201cas such\u201d\n(ch. 1\u20135), which can be considered as a kind of general\nintroduction to what poetry is; and a second part, actually the bulk\nof it, is dedicated to its genres, that is, mainly tragedy and comedy,\nwhere the plot is treated as the main \u201ccomponent\u201d. But\nperhaps most crucially, it also introduces the question of the\n\u201cpower\u201d of each of the poetic genres. The word used is\ndunamis, which is here to be taken in the sense of \u201cthe\nability to put something into movement\u201d, that is, in our case,\nthe power it exercises on the poetry\u2019s recipient, or the\n\u201ceffect\u201d it has on its consumer. It is, one may say, the\n\u201csubjective\u201d counterpart to the more\n\u201cobjective\u201d side of the same thing, that is the function\nor work(ing) (the ergon or energeia) itself. So, the\nfunction of each genre of poetry, or its power or effect, is really\nwhat is of central importance in this inquiry. And (for reasons we are\ngoing to see), plot is seen by Aristotle as the best tool for\nimplementing that effect. Now, it is not to be denied that a\nsuccessful poet is the one who concentrates on plot when writing his\nplays. But this is not Aristotle\u2019s main point of focus. His\ndominant agenda is to warn his readers right at the beginning of his\ntreatise that they must focus on how the plot is constructed if they\nwant to judge the extent to which such and such work of poetry\nsucceeds, i.e., how well it performs its function.\n\nNow, what concretely is the aim or the function of poetry? Homer has\nalready told us very explicitly, notably in the famous episode of the\nSirens (Odyssey 12. 39\u201354; 154\u2013200), that the aim\nof his poetry is pleasure. Listening to the Sirens who are singing\npoetry, presumably Homer\u2019s own Iliad (as they sing\neverything that took place under the walls of Troy), is something\nOdysseus, and actually every man, strongly desires, so strongly, as\nthis episode amply illustrates, that he might even forget the very\ngoal of his journey, namely the goal of returning home and being\nreunited with his family. Aristotle does not hesitate in mentioning\nthat episode when, in the passage from the Eudemian Ethics\nalready quoted, he describes what gazing at beautiful statues or\nlistening to beautiful songs, or poetry, should amount to. In the\nPoetics, this is what he takes for granted: he assumes, as\nHomer does, that providing pleasure is the aim a poet must seek. A\npiece of poetry is successful when it provides pleasure to its\nconsumers. But what precisely is this pleasure that poetry is meant to\nprovide? How shall poetry accomplish that function? These are the\nquestions that underlie the Poetics. \n",
