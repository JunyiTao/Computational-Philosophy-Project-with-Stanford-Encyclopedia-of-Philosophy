    "main_text": "Justice as Impartiality, Politics As Entrepreneurship Without Restraint\n4. Justice as Impartiality, Politics As Entrepreneurship Without Restraint\n\nHayek was a consequentialist of sorts, as was Adam Smith, and yet\nHayek\u2019s defense of economic freedom, like Smith\u2019s, hints\nat a contractarian or deontological moral sensibility that regards the\nseparateness of persons as morally fundamental. Thus, for example,\nHayek says, \u201cthe test of the justice of a rule is usually (since\nKant) described as that of its universalizability\u201d (Hayek 1969,\n168). As John Gray sees it, Hayek commended the laws of justice\n\u201cas being the indispensable condition for the promotion of the\ngeneral welfare\u201d but Hayek held, at the same time, that\n\u201can impartial concern for the general welfare is itself one of\nthe demands of universalizability\u201d (Gray 1984, 65).\n\nIn service of the overall project of fostering the general welfare,\nthe point of law and legislation is to craft a framework such that a\nmarket order is a history of pareto-improving\n trades.[5]\n A primary role of law and (when necessary) legislation is to narrow\npeople\u2019s options so as to limit opportunities to get rich at\nother people\u2019s\n expense.[6]\n So long as the rule of law can internalize external cost and thereby\nsteer innovation in mutually beneficial rather than parasitic\ndirections, an evolving order will be an order of rising\nprosperity.\n\nBy contrast, in a planned order, even astute and conscientious\ndecisions by men of system are damaging in a particular way. Namely,\nto the extent that men of system become micro-managers, they are\nplayers rather than umpires. If bureaucrats start playing the\ngame\u2014responding to ephemeral events with centralized fine\ntuning\u2014then even if they play as cleverly as bureaucrats could\npossibly play, the fact remains that in consequence, the dispersed and\ntacit knowledge of ordinary buyers and sellers ends up on the\nsidelines watching. People who would have been job creators become\nmere spectators, hamstrung by uncertainty, waiting to see what the\nplan is going to be. Until they know the plan, they have no way to\nknow, or even intelligently guess, something as simple as whether\ntheir staff is too small or too large.\n\nGovernment provides the framework for interaction. Ideally, as\nmentioned, government operates only within a stable and known\nframework of rules (Hayek 1944, 113). This is Hayek\u2019s ideal of\ngood government. Is it realistic? Could any government be expected to\nact as an impartial umpire? Hayek saw the rule of law as the\nmarket\u2019s exogenous ecological niche, and thought that this\nniche, the rule of law, must be properly constructed if the process of\nspontaneous order is be a good thing. However, Hayek seemingly came to\ndoubt there could be any such thing as properly constructed rule of\nlaw, for the following reason. Law-making is a process driven by\nprocesses more or less indistinguishable from market process except\nthat benefits to legislators of their law-making are concentrated\nwhile costs are widely dispersed, that is to say, external, and at\nbest only dimly understood even after the\n fact.[7]\n This is not only a moral hazard but an information problem. A piece\nof legislation may be thousands of pages. No one intends the\nbill as a whole. Indeed, there is no overall point to the bill, known\nor otherwise, because, prior to passage, literally no one has even\nread more than a few pages of it, not even the hundreds of legislators\nwho each added a few pages of earmarks as the price of securing their\nvote.\n\nCommon law, by contrast, is a body of practice and tradition that\nsometimes needs to be supplemented by legislation. Crucially, however,\nby virtue of passing the test of time as a device for settling\ndisputes, common law cannot be seen as mere prejudice or superstition.\nOn the contrary, it will have a decided advantage over ongoing\nlegislation, given that legislation is driven by untested ideas about\nhow to respond to the crises of the day, needing to be passed without\nanyone knowing the larger and lasting consequences. Hayek never\ndoubted the need for legislation but lamented our propensity to be\noblivious to its inevitably unintended consequences and to radically\ndiscount its inevitably unseen cost (Hayek 1973, 86). \n",
