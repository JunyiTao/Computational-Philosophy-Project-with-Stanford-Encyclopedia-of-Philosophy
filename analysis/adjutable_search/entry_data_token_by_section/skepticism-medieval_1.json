    "main_text": "Ancient and Hellenistic Sources || Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n1.1 Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n\nPyrrhonian Skepticism, which was to play such an central role in the\nRenaissance and Early Modern Philosophy, had no significant, direct\ninfluence on later medieval thinkers, since texts exploring the\nposition (primarily the works of Sextus Empiricus, and to a much\nlesser extent, Diogenes Laertius) were not in wide circulation.\nFloridi (2002) and Wittwer (2016) explore the textual transmission of\nSextus\u2019s works; Floridi notes that there are only seven known\nLatin manuscripts from the period, though Wittwer has found further\nevidence to supplement this.\n\nA few scattered references to Pyrrhonian skepticism have been found in\nthe Latin West, in the works of Bede (early 8th century), Rabanus\nMaurus (9th century), and Peter of Auvergne (late 13th century). More\nwas known of it to Byzantine and Islamic philosophers, since knowledge\nof Greek was preserved in their intellectual communities, and since\nthey had access to a greater range of ancient texts that addressed the\ntopic.\n",
