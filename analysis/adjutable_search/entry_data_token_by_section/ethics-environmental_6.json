    "main_text": "Traditional Ethical Theories and Contemporary Environment Ethics\n4. Traditional Ethical Theories and Contemporary Environment Ethics\n\nAlthough environmental ethicists often try to distance themselves from\nthe anthropocentrism embedded in traditional ethical views (Passmore\n1974, Norton 1991 are exceptions), they also quite often draw their\ntheoretical resources from traditional ethical systems and theories.\nConsider the following two basic moral questions: (1) What kinds of\nthing are intrinsically valuable, good or bad? (2) What makes an\naction right or wrong?\n\nConsequentialist ethical theories consider intrinsic\n\u201cvalue\u201d / \u201cdisvalue\u201d or \u201cgoodness\u201d\n/ \u201cbadness\u201d to be more fundamental moral notions than\n\u201crightness\u201d / \u201cwrongness\u201d, and maintain that\nwhether an action is right/wrong is determined by whether its\nconsequences are good/bad. From this perspective, answers to question\n(2) are informed by answers to question (1). For instance,\nutilitarianism, a paradigm case of consequentialism, regards pleasure\n(or, more broadly construed, the satisfaction of interest, desire,\nand/or preference) as the only intrinsic value in the world, whereas\npain (or the frustration of desire, interest, and/or preference) is\nthe only intrinsic disvalue, and maintains that right actions are\nthose that would produce the greatest balance of pleasure over pain\n(see the entry on\n consequentialism).\n\nAs the utilitarian focus is the balance of pleasure and pain as such,\nthe question of to whom a pleasure or pain belongs is irrelevant to\nthe calculation and assessment of the rightness or wrongness of\nactions. Hence, the eighteenth century utilitarian Jeremy Bentham\n(1789), and later Peter Singer (1993), have argued that the interests\nof all the sentient beings (i.e., beings who are capable of\nexperiencing pleasure or pain)\u2014including non-human\nones\u2014affected by an action should be taken equally into\nconsideration in assessing the action. Furthermore, rather like\nRoutley (see section 2 above), Singer argues that the anthropocentric\nprivileging of members of the species Homo sapiens is arbitrary, and\nthat it is a kind of \u201cspeciesism\u201d as unjustifiable as\nsexism and racism. Singer regards the animal liberation movement as\ncomparable to the liberation movements of women and people of colour.\nUnlike the environmental philosophers who attribute intrinsic value to\nthe natural environment and its inhabitants, Singer and utilitarians\nin general attribute intrinsic value to the experience of pleasure or\ninterest satisfaction as such, not to the beings who have the\nexperience. Similarly, for the utilitarian, non-sentient objects in\nthe environment such as plant species, rivers, mountains, and\nlandscapes, all of which are the objects of moral concern for\nenvironmentalists, are of no intrinsic but at most instrumental value\nto the satisfaction of sentient beings (see Singer 1993, Ch. 10).\nFurthermore, because right actions, for the utilitarian, are those\nthat maximize the overall balance of interest satisfaction over\nfrustration, practices such as whale-hunting and the killing of an\nelephant for ivory, which cause suffering to non-human animals, might\nturn out to be right after all: such practices might produce\nconsiderable amounts of interest-satisfaction for human beings, which,\non the utilitarian calculation, outweigh the non-human\ninterest-frustration involved. As the result of all the above\nconsiderations, it is unclear to what extent a utilitarian ethic can\nalso be an environmental ethic. This point may not so readily apply to\na wider consequentialist approach, which attributes intrinsic value\nnot only to pleasure or satisfaction, but also to various objects and\nprocesses in the natural environment.\n\nDeontological ethical theories, in contrast, maintain that\nwhether an action is right or wrong is for the most part independent\nof whether its consequences are good or bad (see the entry on\n deontological ethics).\n From the deontologist perspective, there are several distinct moral\nrules or duties (e.g., \u201cnot to kill or otherwise harm the\ninnocent\u201d, \u201cnot to lie\u201d, \u201cto respect the\nrights of others\u201d, \u201cto keep promises\u201d), the\nobservance/violation of which is intrinsically right/wrong; i.e.,\nright/wrong in itself regardless of consequences. When asked to\njustify an alleged moral rule, duty or its corresponding right,\ndeontologists may appeal to the intrinsic value of those beings to\nwhom it applies. For instance, \u201canimal rights\u201d advocate\nTom Regan (1983) argues that those animals with intrinsic value (or\nwhat he calls \u201cinherent value\u201d) have the moral right to\nrespectful treatment, which then generates a general moral duty on our\npart not to treat them as mere means to other ends. We have, in\nparticular, a prima facie moral duty not to harm them. Regan maintains\nthat certain practices (such as sport or commercial hunting, and\nexperimentation on animals) violate the moral right of intrinsically\nvaluable animals to respectful treatment. Such practices, he argues,\nare intrinsically wrong regardless of whether or not some better\nconsequences ever flow from them. Exactly which animals have intrinsic\nvalue and therefore the moral right to respectful treatment?\nRegan\u2019s answer is: those that meet the criterion of being the\n\u201csubject-of-a-life\u201d. To be such a subject is a sufficient\n(though not necessary) condition for having intrinsic value, and to be\na subject-of-a-life involves, among other things, having\nsense-perceptions, beliefs, desires, motives, memory, a sense of the\nfuture, and a psychological identity over time.\n\nSome authors have extended concern for individual well-being further,\narguing for the intrinsic value of organisms achieving their own good,\nwhether those organisms are capable of consciousness or not. Paul\nTaylor\u2019s version of this view (1981 and 1986), which we might\ncall biocentrism, is a somewhat deontological example. He\nargues that each individual living thing in nature\u2014whether it is\nan animal, a plant, or a micro-organism\u2014is a\n\u201cteleological-center-of-life\u201d having a good or well-being\nof its own which can be enhanced or damaged, and that all individuals\nwho are teleological-centers-of life have equal intrinsic value (or\nwhat he calls \u201cinherent worth\u201d) which entitles them to\nmoral respect. Furthermore, Taylor maintains that the intrinsic value\nof wild living things generates a prima facie moral duty on our part\nto preserve or promote their goods as ends in themselves, and that any\npractices which treat those beings as mere means and thus display a\nlack of respect for them are intrinsically wrong. For a summary and\noverview of Taylor\u2019s biocentric ethic, see Brennan and Lo 2010,\n69\u201486. A biologically detailed defence of the idea that living\nthings have representations and goals and hence have moral worth is\nfound in Agar 2001. Unlike Taylor\u2019s egalitarian and\ndeontological biocentrism, Robin Attfield (1987) argues for a\nhierarchical view that while all beings having a good of their own\nhave intrinsic value, some of them (e.g., persons) have intrinsic\nvalue to a greater extent. Attfield also endorses a form of\nconsequentialism which takes into consideration, and attempts to\nbalance, the many and possibly conflicting goods of different living\nthings (see also Varner 1998 for a defense of biocentric individualism\nwith affinities to both consequentialist and deontological\napproaches). However, some critics have pointed out that the notion of\nbiological good or well-being is only descriptive not prescriptive\n(see Williams 1992 and O\u2019Neill 1993, Ch. 2). For instance, even\nif HIV has a good of its own this does not mean that we ought to\nassign any positive moral weight to the realization of that good.\n\nSubsequently the distinction between these two traditional approaches\nhas taken its own specific form of development in environmental\nphilosophy. Instead of pitting conceptions of value against\nconceptions of rights, it has been suggested that there may be two\ndifferent conceptions of intrinsic value in play in discussion about\nenvironmental good and evil. One the one side, there is the intrinsic\nvalue of states of affairs that are to be promoted\u2014and this is\nthe focus of the consequentialist thinkers. On the other\n(deontological) hand there is the intrinsic values of entities to be\nrespected (see Bradley 2006, McShane 2014). These two different foci\nfor the notion of intrinsic value still provide room for fundamental\nargument between deontologists and consequentialist to continue,\nalbeit in a somewhat modified form.\n\nNote that the ethics of animal liberation or animal rights and\nbiocentrism are both individualistic in that their various\nmoral concerns are directed towards individuals only\u2014not\necological wholes such as species, populations, biotic communities,\nand ecosystems. None of these is sentient, a subject-of-a-life, or a\nteleological-center-of-life, but the preservation of these collective\nentities is a major concern for many environmentalists. Moreover, the\ngoals of animal liberationists, such as the reduction of animal\nsuffering and death, may conflict with the goals of environmentalists.\nFor example, the preservation of the integrity of an ecosystem may\nrequire the culling of feral animals or of some indigenous animal\npopulations that threaten to destroy fragile habitats. So there are\ndisputes about whether the ethics of animal liberation is a proper\nbranch of environmental ethics (see Callicott 1980, 1988, Sagoff 1984,\nJamieson 1998, Crisp 1998 and Varner 2000).\n\nCriticizing the individualistic approach in general for failing to\naccommodate conservation concerns for ecological wholes, J. Baird\nCallicott (1980) once advocated a version of land-ethical\nholism which takes Leopold\u2019s statement \u201cA thing\nis right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and\nbeauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise\u201d to be the supreme deontological principle. In this\ntheory, the earth\u2019s biotic community per se is the sole\nlocus of intrinsic value, whereas the value of its individual members\nis merely instrumental and dependent on their contribution to the\n\u201cintegrity, stability, and beauty\u201d of the larger\ncommunity. A straightforward implication of this version of the land\nethic is that an individual member of the biotic community ought to be\nsacrificed whenever that is needed for the protection of the holistic\ngood of the community. For instance, Callicott maintains that if\nculling a white-tailed deer is necessary for the protection of the\nholistic biotic good, then it is a land-ethical requirement to do so.\nBut, to be consistent, the same point also applies to human\nindividuals because they are also members of the biotic community. Not\nsurprisingly, the misanthropy implied by Callicott\u2019s\nland-ethical holism was widely criticized and regarded as a\nreductio of the position (see Aiken (1984), Kheel (1985),\nFerr\u00e9 (1996), and Shrader-Frechette (1996)). Tom Regan (1983,\np.362), in particular, condemned the holistic land ethic\u2019s\ndisregard of the rights of the individual as \u201cenvironmental\nfascism\u201d. Since then commentators have noted the links between\nfascism and conservation thinking (Biehl and Staudenmaier 2011). The\nsubsequent emergence of explicitly ecofascist on-line movements and\nterrorist acts that claim to be ecologically-inspired (Lawton 2019)\nlead one writer to declare that there is a danger the world will enter\nan age of \u201cclimate barbarism\u201d(Klein 2019).\n\nUnder pressure from the charge of ecofascism and misanthropy,\nCallicott (1989 Ch. 5, and 1999, Ch. 4) later revises his\nneo-Leopodian position to maintain that the biotic community (indeed,\nany community to which humans belong) as well as its individual\nmembers (indeed, any individual who shares with us membership in some\ncommon community) all have intrinsic value. To further distance\nhimself from the charge of ecofascism, Callicott introduced explicit\nprinciples which prioritize obligations to human communities over\nthose to natural ones. He called these \u201csecond-order\u201d\nprinciples for specifying the conditions under which the land\nethic\u2019s holistic and individualistic obligations were to be\nranked. As he put it:\n\n... obligations generated by membership in more venerable and\nintimate communities take precedence over these generated in more\nrecently-emerged and impersonal communities... The second second-order\nprinciple is that stronger interests (for lack of a better\nword) generate duties that take precedence over duties generated by\nweaker interests. (Callicott 1999, 76)\n\n\nLo 2001 provides an overview and critique of Callicott\u2019s\nchanging position over two decades, while Ouderkirk and Hill (eds.)\n2002 gives an overview of debates between Callicott and others\nconcerning the metaethical and metaphysical foundations for the land\nethic and also its historical antecedents. As Lo points out, the final\nmodified version of the land ethic needs more than two second-order\nprinciples, since a third-order principle is needed to specify\nCallicott\u2019s implicit view that the second second-order principle\ngenerally countermands the first one when they come into conflict (Lo\n2001, 345). In later work, Callicott follows Lo\u2019s suggestion,\nwhile cautioning against aiming for too much precision in specifying\nthe demands of the land ethic (Callicott 2013, 66\u20137). While\nCallicott\u2019s reading of Leopold is widely regarded as authoritative,\nlater writers have queried whether Leopold might be better interpreted\na a moral pluralist (Dixon 2017) and have also raised doubts about the\nform of Darwinism that Leopold is supposed to have espoused (Millstein\n2015). For further critique of Callicott on Leopold, see also Newman,\nVarner and Linquist 2017, ch.10. \n\nThe controversy surrounding Callicott\u2019s original position,\nhowever, has inspired efforts in environmental ethics to investigate\npossibilities of attributing intrinsic value to ecological wholes, not\njust their individual constituent parts. Following in\nCallicott\u2019s footsteps, and inspired by N\u00e6ss\u2019s\nrelational account of value, Warwick Fox has championed a theory of\n\u201cresponsive cohesion\u201d which aims to give supreme moral\npriority to the maintenance of ecosystems and the biophysical world\n(Fox 2007). It remains to be seen if this position escapes the charges\nof misanthropy and totalitarianism laid against earlier holistic and\nrelational theories of value.\n\nIndividual natural entities (whether sentient or not, living or not),\nAndrew Brennan (1984, 2014) argues, are not designed by anyone to\nfulfill any purpose and therefore lack \u201cintrinsic\nfunction\u201d (i.e., the function of a thing that constitutes part\nof its essence or identity conditions). This, he proposes, is a reason\nfor thinking that individual natural entities should not be treated as\nmere instruments, and thus a reason for assigning them intrinsic\nvalue. Furthermore, he argues that the same moral point applies to the\ncase of natural ecosystems, to the extent that they lack intrinsic\nfunction. In the light of Brennan\u2019s proposal, Eric Katz (1991\nand 1997) argues that all natural entities, whether individuals or\nwholes, have intrinsic value in virtue of their ontological\nindependence from human purpose, activity, and interest, and maintains\nthe deontological principle that nature as a whole is an\n\u201cautonomous subject\u201d which deserves moral respect and must\nnot be treated as a mere means to human ends. Carrying the project of\nattributing intrinsic value to nature to its ultimate form, Robert\nElliot (1997) argues that naturalness itself is a property in virtue\nof possessing which all natural things, events, and states of affairs,\nattain intrinsic value. Furthermore, Elliot argues that even a\nconsequentialist, who in principle allows the possibility of trading\noff intrinsic value from naturalness for intrinsic value from other\nsources, could no longer justify such kind of trade-off in reality.\nThis is because the reduction of intrinsic value due to the depletion\nof naturalness on earth, according to him, has reached such a level\nthat any further reduction of it could not be compensated by any\namount of intrinsic value generated in other ways, no matter how great\nit is.\n\nAs the notion of \u201cnatural\u201d is understood in terms of the\nlack of human contrivance and is often opposed to the notion of\n\u201cartifactual\u201d, one much contested issue concerns the value\nof those parts of nature that have been touched by human\nartifice\u2014for instance, previously degraded natural environments\nwhich have been humanly restored. Based on the premise that the\nproperties of being naturally evolved and having a natural continuity\nwith the remote past are \u201cvalue adding\u201d (i.e., adding\nintrinsic value to those things which possess those two properties),\nElliot argues that even a perfectly restored environment would\nnecessarily lack those two value-adding properties and therefore be\nless valuable than the originally undegraded natural environment.\nKatz, on the other hand, argues that a restored nature is really just\nan artifact designed and created for the satisfaction of human ends,\nand that the value of restored environments is instrumental. He\nfurther argues that restoration is a form of the \u201cdomination of\nreality\u201d and controversially compares such domination to Nazi\npolicies of xenophobia, nativism and eliminationsm (Katz 2021).\nCritics have pointed out that advocates of a moral dichotomy between\nthe natural and the artifactual run the risk of diminishing the value\nof human life and culture, and fail to recognize that the natural\nenvironments interfered with by humans may still have morally\nimportant qualities other than pure naturalness (see Lo 1999, and\nKatz\u2019s response in Katz 2012).\n\nTwo other issues central to this debate are that the key concept\n\u201cnatural\u201d seems ambiguous in many different ways (see Hume\n1751, App. 3; Mill 1874; Brennan [1988] 2014; Ch. 6; Elliot 1997, Ch.\n4), and that those who argue that human interference reduces the\nintrinsic value of nature seem to have simply assumed the crucial\npremise that naturalness is a source of intrinsic value. Some thinkers\nmaintain that the natural, or the \u201cwild\u201d construed as that\nwhich \u201cis not humanized\u201d (Hettinger and Throop 1999, p.\n12) or to some degree \u201cnot under human control\u201d (ibid., p.\n13) is intrinsically valuable. Yet, as Bernard Williams points out\n(Williams 1992), we may, paradoxically, need to use our technological\npowers to retain a sense of something not being in our power. The\nretention of wild areas may thus involve planetary and ecological\nmanagement to maintain, or even \u201cimprison\u201d such areas\n(Birch 1990), raising a question over the extent to which national\nparks and wilderness areas are free from our control. An anlogy with\ngardening has sometimes been used to explore the nature of restoration\n(Allison 2004).\n\nGiven the significance of the concept of naturalness in these debates,\nit is perhaps surprising that there has been relatively little\nanalysis of that concept itself in environmental thought. In his\npioneering work on the ethics of the environment, Holmes Rolston has\nworked with a number of different conceptions of the natural (see\nBrennan and Lo 2010, pp.116\u201323, for an analysis of three senses\nof the term \u201cnatural\u201d that may be found in Rolston\u2019s\nwork). An explicit attempt to provide a conceptual analysis of a\ndifferent sort is found in Siipi 2008, while an account of naturalness\nlinking this to historical narratives of place is given in\nO\u2019Neill, Holland and Light 2008, ch. 8 (compare the response to\nthis in Siipi 2011). For reflections on how to protect \u201cone\nnature with several representations\u201d from the perspective of\nscience policy see Ducarme and Couvet 2020.\n\nFinally, as an alternative to consequentialism and deontology both of\nwhich consider \u201cthin\u201d concepts such as\n\u201cgoodness\u201d and \u201crightness\u201d as essential to\nmorality, virtue ethics proposes to understand\nmorality\u2014and assess the ethical quality of actions\u2014in\nterms of \u201cthick\u201d concepts such as \u201ckindness\u201d,\n\u201chonesty\u201d, \u201csincerity\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d. These, and other excellent traits of character\nare virtues (see the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n As virtue ethics speaks quite a different language from the other two\nkinds of ethical theory, its theoretical focus is not so much on what\nkinds of things are good/bad, or what makes an action right/wrong.\nIndeed, the richness of the language of virtues, and the emphasis on\nmoral character, is sometimes cited as a reason for exploring a\nvirtues-based approach to the complex and always-changing questions of\nsustainability and environmental care (Hill 1983, Wensveen 2000,\nSandler 2007). One question central to virtue ethics is what the moral\nreasons are for acting one way or another. For instance, from the\nperspective of virtue ethics, kindness and loyalty would be moral\nreasons for helping a friend in hardship. These are quite different\nfrom the deontologist\u2019s reason (that the action is demanded by a\nmoral rule) or the consequentialist reason (that the action will lead\nto a better over-all balance of good over evil in the world). From the\nperspective of virtue ethics, the motivation and justification of\nactions are both inseparable from the character traits of the acting\nagent. Furthermore, unlike deontology or consequentialism the moral\nfocus of which is other people or states of the world, one central\nissue for virtue ethics is how to live a flourishing human life, this\nbeing a central concern of the moral agent himself or herself.\n\u201cLiving virtuously\u201d is Aristotle\u2019s recipe for\nflourishing. Versions of virtue ethics advocating virtues such as\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d, \u201cpiety\u201d,\n\u201cfiliality\u201d, and \u201ccourage\u201d, have also been\nheld by thinkers in the Chinese Confucian tradition. The connection\nbetween morality and psychology is another core subject of\ninvestigation for virtue ethics. It is sometimes suggested that human\nvirtues, which constitute an important aspect of a flourishing human\nlife, must be compatible with human needs and desires, and perhaps\nalso sensitive to individual affection and temperaments. As its\ncentral focus is human flourishing as such, virtue ethics may seem\nunavoidably anthropocentric and unable to support a genuine moral\nconcern for the non-human environment. But just as Aristotle has\nargued that a flourishing human life requires friendships and one can\nhave genuine friendships only if one genuinely values, loves,\nrespects, and cares for one\u2019s friends for their own sake, not\nmerely for the benefits that they may bring to oneself, some have\nargued that a flourishing human life requires the moral capacities to\nvalue, love, respect, and care for the non-human natural world as an\nend in itself (see O\u2019Neill 1992, O\u2019Neill 1993, Barry\n1999). Not only Aristotle, but also Kant can be used in support of\nsuch a position. Toby Svoboda argues, for example, that even indirect\nduties to protect nature can be the basis of good moral reasons to\npromote the flourishing of natural things, regardless of whether doing\nso promotes human interests (Svoboda 2019). Other virtue ethicists\nclaim to be able to provie an account of what it is to feel guilt\nabout damage people have done to the environment and to make sense of\nthe idea of a genuine feeling of gratitude toward nature \u201cfor\nbeing what it is\u201d (Wood 2019).\n\nSupplementary Document:\n\nBiodiversity Preservation\n\n",
