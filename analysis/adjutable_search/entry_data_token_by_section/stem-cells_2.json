    "main_text": "The Ethics of Destroying Human Embryos for Research || The moral status of human embryos\n1.2 The moral status of human embryos\n\n\nSuppose that the 5-day human embryo is a human being. On the\nstandard argument against HESC research, membership in the species\nHomo sapiens confers on the embryo a right not to be\nkilled. This view is grounded in the assumption that human beings\nhave the same moral status (at least with respect to possessing this\nright) at all stages of their lives.\n\n\nSome accept that the human embryo is a human being but argue that\nthe human embryo does not have the moral status requisite for a right\nto life. There is reason to think that species membership is not\nthe property that determines a being\u2019s moral status. We\nhave all been presented with the relevant thought experiments, courtesy\nof Disney, Orwell, Kafka, and countless science fiction works. The\nresults seem clear: we regard mice, pigs, insects, aliens, and so on,\nas having the moral status of persons in those possible worlds in which\nthey exhibit the psychological and cognitive traits that we normally\nassociate with mature human beings. This suggests that it is some\nhigher-order mental capacity (or capacities) that grounds the right to\nlife. While there is no consensus about the capacities that\nare necessary for the right to life, some of the capacities that have\nbeen proposed include reasoning, self-awareness, and agency (Kuhse\n& Singer 1992, Tooley 1983, Warren 1973).\n\n\nThe main difficulty for those who appeal to such mental capacities\nas the touchstone for the right to life is that early human infants\nlack these capacities, and do so to a greater degree than many of the\nnonhuman animals that most deem it acceptable to kill (Marquis\n2002). This presents a challenge for those who hold that the\nnon-consequentialist constraints on killing human children and adults\napply to early human infants. Some reject that these constraints apply\nto infants, and allow that there may be circumstances where it is\npermissible to sacrifice infants for the greater good (McMahan\n2007b). Others argue that, while infants do not have the\nintrinsic properties that ground a right to life, we should nonetheless\ntreat them as if they have a right to life in order to promote love and\nconcern towards them, as these attitudes have good consequences for the\npersons they will become (Benn 1973, Strong 1997).\n\n\nSome claim that we can reconcile the ascription of a right to life to\nall humans with the view that higher order mental capacities ground\nthe right to life by distinguishing between two senses of mental\ncapacities: \u201cimmediately exercisable\u201d capacities and\n\u201cbasic natural\u201d capacities. (George and Gomez-Lobo 2002,\n260). According to this view, an individual\u2019s immediately exercisable\ncapacity for higher mental functions is the actualization of natural\ncapacities for higher mental functions that exist at the embryonic\nstage of life. Human embryos have a \u201crational nature,\u201d but\nthat nature is not fully realized until individuals are able to\nexercise their capacity to reason. The difference between these types\nof capacity is said to be a difference between degrees of development\nalong a continuum.  There is merely a quantitative difference between\nthe mental capacities of embryos, fetuses, infants, children, and\nadults (as well as among infants, children, and adults). And this\ndifference, so the argument runs, cannot justify treating some of\nthese individuals with moral respect while denying it to others.\n\n\nGiven that a human embryo cannot reason at all, the claim that it\nhas a rational nature has struck some as tantamount to asserting that\nit has the potential to become an individual that can engage in\nreasoning (Sagan & Singer 2007). But an entity\u2019s\nhaving this potential does not logically entail that it has the same\nstatus as beings that have realized some or all of their potential\n(Feinberg 1986). Moreover, with the advent of cloning\ntechnologies, the range of entities that we can now identify as\npotential persons arguably creates problems for those who place great\nmoral weight on the embryo\u2019s potential. A single somatic\ncell or HESC can in principle (though not yet in practice) develop into\na mature human being under the right conditions\u2014that is, where\nthe cell\u2019s nucleus is transferred into an enucleated egg, the new\negg is electrically stimulated to create an embryo, and the embryo is\ntransferred to a woman\u2019s uterus and brought to term. If the\nbasis for protecting embryos is that they have the potential to become\nreasoning beings, then, some argue, we have reason to ascribe a high\nmoral status to the trillions of cells that share this potential and to\nassist as many of these cells as we reasonably can to realize their\npotential (Sagan & Singer 2007, Savulescu 1999).\nBecause this is a stance that we can expect nearly everyone to reject,\nit\u2019s not clear that opponents of HESC research can effectively\nground their position in the human embryo\u2019s potential.\n\n\nOne response to this line of argument has been to claim that embryos\npossess a kind of potential that somatic cells and HESCs lack. An\nembryo has potential in the sense of having an \u201cactive\ndisposition\u201d and \u201cintrinsic power\u201d to develop into a\nmature human being (Lee & George 2006). An embryo can\nmature on its own in the absence of interference with its development.\nA somatic cell, on the other hand, does not have the inherent capacity\nor disposition to grow into a mature human being. However, some\nquestion whether this distinction is viable, especially in the HESC\nresearch context. While it is true that somatic cells can realize\ntheir potential only with the assistance of outside interventions, an\nembryo\u2019s development also requires that numerous conditions\nexternal to it are satisfied. In the case of embryos that are\nnaturally conceived, they must implant, receive nourishment, and avoid\nexposure to dangerous substances in utero. In the case\nof spare embryos created through in vitro fertilization\u2014which\nare presently the source of HESCs for research\u2014the embryos must\nbe thawed and transferred to a willing woman\u2019s\nuterus. Given the role that external factors\u2014including \ntechnological interventions\u2014play in an embryo\u2019s\nrealizing its potential, one can question whether there is a morally\nrelevant distinction between an embryo\u2019s and somatic cell\u2019s\npotential and thus raise doubts about potentiality as a foundation for\nthe right to life (Devolder & Harris 2007).\n\n\nSome grant that human embryos lack the properties essential to a\nright to life, but hold that they possess an intrinsic value that calls\nfor a measure of respect and places at least some moral constraints on\ntheir use: \u201cThe life of a single human organism commands\nrespect and protection \u2026 no matter in what form or shape,\nbecause of the complex creative investment it represents and because of\nour wonder at the divine or evolutionary processes that produce new\nlives from old ones.\u201d (Dworkin l992, 84). There are,\nhowever, divergent views about the level of respect embryos command and\nwhat limits exist on their use. Some opponents of HESC research\nhold that the treatment of human embryos as mere research tools always\nfails to manifest proper respect for them. Other opponents take a\nless absolutist view. Some, for example, deem embryos less\nvaluable than more mature human beings but argue that the benefits of\nHESC research are too speculative to warrant the destruction of\nembryos, and that the benefits might, in any case, be achieved through\nthe use of noncontroversial sources of stem cells (e.g., adult stem\ncells) (Holm 2003).\n\n\nMany, if not most, who support the use of human embryos for HESC\nresearch would likely agree with opponents of the research that there\nare some circumstances where the use of human embryos would display a\nlack of appropriate respect for human life, for example, were they to\nbe offered for consumption to contestants in a reality TV competition\nor destroyed for the production of cosmetics. But proponents of the\nresearch hold that the value of human embryos is not great enough to\nconstrain the pursuit of research that may yield significant\ntherapeutic benefits. Supporters of the research also frequently\nquestion whether most opponents of the research are consistent in their\nascription of a high value to human embryos, as opponents generally\ndisplay little concern about the fact that many embryos created for\nfertility treatment are discarded.\n",
