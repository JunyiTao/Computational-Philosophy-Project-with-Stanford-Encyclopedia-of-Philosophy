    "main_text": "Yin Wen\n4. Yin Wen\n\nLittle is known of Yin Wen (fl. late 4th century B.C.E.), and it is\nunclear why the Han History classifies him with the\n\u201cSchool of Names.\u201d Perhaps the one scroll of writings by\nhim mentioned in the \u201cBibliographical Treatise\u201d was about\nlanguage. What little information we have about him comes mainly from\ntwo sources, the \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d essay and The Annals\nof L\u00fc Buwei, both of which are considerably later than his\nlifetime and thus must be taken mainly to be reporting legend. Neither\ntext attributes to him views on language or disputation. \u201cUnder\nHeaven\u201d links him to Song Xing, his teacher or colleague, and\nthe pair were among the many scholars who gathered at Jixia in Qi\nunder the patronage of King Xuan (r. 319\u2013301\n B.C.E.).[9]\n Xunzi rebuts several of Song Xing\u2019s doctrines at length but\ndoes not mention Yin Wen.\n\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d portrays Yin Wen and Song Xing as tireless\ncrusaders devoted to saving the world by advocating non-aggression, a\nlife of few, easily satisfied desires, and a tolerant, unbiased frame\nof mind. To promote these doctrines, they \u201ctraveled the world,\npersuading the high and instructing the low.\u201d In relations with\nothers, to save people from fighting they taught that \u201cto be\ninsulted is no disgrace,\u201d and to save the world from war, they\ntaught \u201cforbid aggression and put troops to rest.\u201d (As the\nname suggests, the Warring States era was marked by frequent,\ncatastrophic wars.) Concerning the self, they held that the inherent\ndesires are few and shallow, a doctrine that, if true, would remove\nmany potential reasons for conflict. \u201cTheir starting point in\ndealing with things was avoiding enclosures,\u201d or psychological\nbarriers due to prejudice or dogmatic commitment which tend to result\nin biased or one-sided judgments. Such \u201cenclosures\u201d are\nfrequently also a source of conflict, since they may prevent one from\nappreciating all relevant features of a situation or understanding\nothers\u2019 point of view. Yin Wen and Song Xing emphasized that the\nheart itself has a kind of \u201cconduct,\u201d independent of\nexternal conduct. In their anti-war stance and emphasis on benefit,\nthey display affinities with Mohist thought: \u201cIf something was\nof no advantage to the world, understanding it was not as good as\nabandoning it.\u201d But the doctrines of tolerance and avoiding bias\nare genuinely novel, and are probably the reason Song Xing is singled\nout for praise in the Zhuangzi (Book 1). \n\nThe Annals of L\u00fc Buwei depicts Yin Wen in an audience\nwith King Min of Qi (r. 300\u2013284 B.C.E.), defending the doctrine\nthat to be insulted is not disgraceful. (Again, we should keep in mind\nthat the details of the story may be mostly later invention.) The\nanecdote vividly illustrates several of the main techniques by which\nthe disputers conducted their craft. Yin Wen identifies distinguishing\nfeatures for calling things by a certain name and employs models and\nanalogies to persuade the king. The context of the passage is a\ndiscussion of \u201ccorrecting names.\u201d Because he failed to\ncorrect his own use of names, King Min knew enough to be fond of\n\u201cofficers\u201d but not how to distinguish the sort of people\nproperly referred to as \u201cofficers.\u201d (Shi,\n\u201cofficer,\u201d was a social rank similar to\n\u201cknight,\u201d but by this era it had lost most of its martial\nconnotation.) Yin Wen proposes that \u201cofficers\u201d are\ndistinguished by four types of conduct: they are filial in serving\ntheir parents, loyal in serving their ruler, trustworthy toward\nfriends, and brotherly toward neighbors. The king agrees, indicating\nalso that this is just the sort of person he would appoint as a\ngovernment official. Yin Wen asks whether the king would still appoint\nsuch a person supposing that, on being insulted in public, he did not\nfight. The king replies that to be insulted is a disgrace; he would\nnot appoint a disgraced person. \n\nYin Wen said: \u201cThough when insulted he does not fight, he has\nnot strayed from the four types of conduct. Not straying from the four\ntypes of conduct, this is not losing that by which he is an officer.\nIf, not losing that by which he is an officer, in the one case the\nKing would appoint him an official, in the other case not, then is\nwhat we earlier called an \u2018officer\u2019 indeed an\n\u2018officer\u2019?\u201d\n\n\nThe King had no response.\n\nYin Wen said, \u201cSuppose there is a man here, when governing his\nstate, if people do wrong he condemns them, if people do no wrong he\ncondemns them; if people commit a crime he punishes them, if people\ncommit no crime he punishes them. Then would it be admissible for him\nto despise the people for being hard to govern?\u201d\n\nThe King said, \u201cNot admissible.\u201d \n\nYin Wen said, \u201c\u2026The King\u2019s command says: \u2018One\nwho kills another dies, one who injures another is maimed.\u2019 The\npeople, fearing the King\u2019s command, dare not fight even when\ndeeply insulted; this is fulfilling the King\u2019s command. Yet the\nKing says, \u2018Not daring to fight when insulted, this is a\ndisgrace.\u2019 Now to call it a disgrace, it\u2019s this\nthat\u2019s called \u2018condemning it\u2019. In the one case to\nappoint a person as an official, in the other not, this is deeming it\na crime. This is the King punishing someone when he has committed no\ncrime.\u201d\n\nThe King had no response. (16.8/402)\n\n\nKing Min is presented as an example of someone whose use of names,\nsuch as \u2018officer\u2019, is incorrect: name and form do not\n\u201cfit.\u201d As a result, \u201cthose he calls worthy are\nunworthy, what he calls good is depraved, and what he calls admissible\nis perverse.\u201d Interestingly, the text employs terminology that\ndovetails with later Mohist semantic theory and epistemology. It\nexplains that the King did not know the \u201creason\u201d or\n\u201cbasis\u201d for deeming people \u201cofficers,\u201d using\nthe same term as the Mohists\u2014gu\u2014and alludes to\nhis poor ability to classify or \u201csort\u201d (lun)\nthings into kinds, which in later Mohist epistemology is the mark of\nunderstanding. Though the Annals story does not make this point\nexplicitly, we can link the King\u2019s erroneous\n\u201csorting\u201d to Yin Wen\u2019s doctrine of \u201cavoiding\nenclosures.\u201d The King\u2019s judgments about officers are\n\u201cenclosed\u201d by his dogmatic conviction that to be insulted\nis a disgrace and that an officer must answer challenges to his honor\nwith violence.\n",
