    "main_text": "The Logic of Communication || Communication and Distributed Computing\n4.1 Communication and Distributed Computing\n\nIn the following example, the inspiration does not only flow from\nsocial problems to formal solutions, but also the other way, from\nsuccessful social practices to formal procedures. Many algorithms for\ndistributed computing are related to social protocols for\ncommunication in everyday life. An example is the use of a\n\u201ctalking stick\u201d to regulate discussion and decision making\nin a group of peers, with the rules that the talking stick gets passed\naround and only the person who is holding the stick is allowed to talk\n(Nerburn 1999).\n\nA computer communication protocol based on this social procedure is\nthe token ring protocol. A token ring in\ndistributed computing is a network where each computer is connected to\nexactly two other computers in such a way that each computer is\nreachable in the network, and where a single \u201ctoken\u201d\ncirculates around the ring-shaped network. Communication can only be\ninitiated by the current owner of the token.\n\nSometimes the token gets lost through computer or network failure. In\nsuch cases the token has to be regenerated, with a guarantee that only\none computer has the token. This problem of regenerating the token in\na token ring is called the leader election\nproblem. Here is an algorithm for it:\n\n\nAssume that communication takes place clockwise, and each computer can\ndistinguish its clockwise neighbour from its counterclockwise\nneighbour. Assume that all computers have different identifiers\n(positive whole numbers) and each computer knows its identifier.\n\nEach computer sends its identifier around the ring. When a computer\n\\(c\\) receives an identifier, \\(c\\) compares it to its own. If the\nidentifier is greater than its own, \\(c\\) passes it on. If it is less\nthan its own, \\(c\\) discards it. If it is equal to its own, \\(c\\)\ndeclares itself to be the leader.\n\n\nIt is not hard to see that this guarantees the computer with the\nhighest identifier \\(i_{\\text{max}}\\) to become the leader (see Lynch\n1996). No assumptions need to be made\nabout the number of computers in the ring, nor about any computer\nknowing anything about the size of the ring or the identifiers of the\nother computers. A next stage of the protocol could be for the leader\nto send around a request to register as non-leader and halt.\n\nOne further level of abstraction is from distributed computers or\nprocesses to interacting intelligent agents, or multi-agent systems.\nThese agents can be computers, robots, humans, teams of humans, or\nsome mix of these. It is commonly assumed that the agents have a\ndegree of autonomy, that the agents have a restricted local view of\nthe system as a whole, and that there is no designated controller of\nthe whole system (see Wooldridge 2002 [2009]).\n",
