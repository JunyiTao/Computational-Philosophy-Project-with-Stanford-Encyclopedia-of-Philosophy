    "main_text": "Descriptive Accounts, Content-Directed || Cognitive models of communication\n3.2 Cognitive models of communication\n\nPerhaps the best way of capturing the cognitive nature of assertion is\nto give a theory of the cognitive features of normal communication by\nmeans of assertion. A classic theory is Stalnaker\u2019s (1974,\n1978). Stalnaker provides a model of a conversation in which assertion\nand presupposition dynamically interact. On Stalnaker\u2019s model,\npropositions are presupposed in a conversation if they are on record\nas belonging to the common ground between the speakers. When an\nassertion is made and accepted in the conversation, its content is\nadded to the common ground, and the truth of the proposition in\nquestion will be presupposed in later stages. What is presupposed at a\ngiven stage has an effect on the interpretation of new utterances made\nat that stage. For Stalnaker, the common ground is a set of\npropositions. He models this with the set of worlds in which all\ncommon ground propositions are true, the context set.\n\nIn this framework Stalnaker (1978: 88\u201389) proposes three rules\nfor assertion:\n\n(Stal)\n\n\ni.\nA proposition is always true in some but not in all of the\npossible worlds in the context set.\nii.\nAny assertive utterance should express a proposition, relative to\neach possible world in the context set, and that proposition should\nhave truth value in each possible world in the context set.\niii.\nThe same proposition is expressed relative to each possible world\nin the context set.\n \n\n\nStalnaker comments on the first rule:\n\n\nTo assert something incompatible with what is presupposed is\nself-defeating [\u2026] And to assert something which already\npresupposed is to attempt to do something that is already done.\n\n\nOn such an approach, the satisfaction of a presupposition is an\nadmittance condition of an assertion (cf. Karttunen 1974;\nHeim 1988). This idea connects with Austin\u2019s more general idea\nof felicity conditions of speech\n acts.[14]\n Does Stalnaker offer an account of assertion itself? The answer is\nno, for the role of assertion is shared by other speech acts such as\nassuming and conjecturing (Stalnaker 1978: 153).\nWhat is added to the common ground is only for the purpose of\nconversation, and need not be actually believed by the\nparticipants. It is only required that it be accepted (cf.\nStalnaker 2002: 716).\n\nStalnaker has not (as far as we are aware) attempted to add a\ndistinguishing feature of assertion to the model. This has, however,\nbeen attempted by Schaffer (2008), K\u00f6lbel (2011: 68\u201370),\nand Stokke\n (2013).[15]\n\nAnother cognitive account is offered by Pagin (2011, 2020). The\naccount is summarized by the phrase: \u201can assertion is an\nutterance that is prima facie informative\u201d. For an utterance to\nbe informative is for it to be made in part \u201cbecause it is\ntrue\u201d. What this amounts to is different, but complementary, for\nspeaker and hearer. For the speaker, part of the reason for\nusing a particular sentence is that it is true (in context); that is,\nthe speaker believes, with a sufficient strength, that the sentence\nexpresses a true proposition, and utters it partly because of that.\nFor the hearer, taking the utterance as informative, means, by\ndefault, to update their credence in the proposition as a response to\nthe utterance, both in the upwards direction and to a level above\n0.5.\n\nThe prima facie element of the account means that the typical\nproperties on the speaker and hearer side are only default\nproperties associated with surface features of the utterance: the\ndeclarative sentence type, a typical intonation pattern, etc. There\nare many possible reasons why a speaker may utter such a sentence\nwithout believing the proposition, and why a hearer may not adjust\ntheir credence in the typical manner. For example, the speaker may be\nlying, the hearer may distrust the speaker, or may already have given\nthe proposition a very high credence before the utterance. On\nPagin\u2019s picture, it is the cognitive patterns associated with\nsurface features, on the production and comprehension sides, that\ncharacterize assertion. This way of dividing the account between\nspeaker and hearer is somewhat controversial.\n\nYet another cognitive account is elaborated in Jary (2010).\nJary\u2019s account is situated within Relevance Theory, a\nmore general account of cognition and communication. As a typical\ningredient of this general framework, when an assertion is made, the\nproposition expressed by the utterance is presented as \u201crelevant\nto the hearer\u201d (2010: 163), where \u2018relevant\u2019 is a\ntechnical term (Sperber & Wilson 1986 [1995: 265]).\n\nWhat distinguishes assertion from other speech act types is something\ndifferent:\n\n\nAssertion cannot be defined thus, though. In order for an utterance to\nhave assertoric force, it must also be subject to the cognitive and\nsocial safeguards that distinguish assertion. [\u2026] It is the\napplicability of these safeguards that distinguishes assertion both\nfrom other illocutionary acts and from other forms of information\ntransfer. (Jary 2010: 163\u2013164)\n\n\nSocial safeguards consist in sanctions against misleading assertions,\nwhile cognitive safeguards consist in the ability of the hearer to not\nsimply accept what is said but meta-represent the speaker as\nexpressing certain beliefs and intentions (2010: 160). It is part of a\nfull account of assertion, according to Jary, that assertions are\nsubject to these safeguards. This also distinguishes assertions from\npromises and commands, where the proposition is not presented as\nsubject to the hearer\u2019s safeguards; \u201crejection is not\npresented as an option for the hearer\u201d (2010: 73).\n",
