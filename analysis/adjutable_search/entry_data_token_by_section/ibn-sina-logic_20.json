    "main_text": "Demonstration || Why- and That-Demonstration\n6.6 Why- and That-Demonstration\n\nAvicenna\u2019s re-interpretation of the distinction between a\ndemonstration that something is the case and a demonstration why\nsomething is the case is related (i) to the classification of per se,\ni.e., to the types of predicates used in demonstrative arguments,\nand (ii) to the division of the sciences (Strobino forthcoming).\n\nAvicenna distinguishes between two main types of demonstration in function of the types of predicates involved (in first-figure\ncategorical syllogisms): (a) those in which the middle term expresses\na per se 2 attribute of the minor, in which case the major may be\neither (aa) a per se 2 attribute of the middle or (ab) a per se 1\nattribute of the middle; and (b) those in which the middle term\nexpresses a per se 1 attribute of the minor, in which case the major is\nin most cases (ba) a per se 2 attribute of the middle, and only in two exceptional cases (bb) a per se 1 attribute of the middle (the reason is that\nusually demonstrations do not aim to prove that per se 1 attributes\nhold of their subjects, these relations being self-evident and captured by\ndefinitions).\n\nWhile proving an assertion, a demonstration may merely provide\nan inferential justification of it or, in addition to that, also the terms that causally explain why things are the way they are. All demonstrations of the\nfirst kind are that-demonstrations; all demonstrations of the second\nkind are why-demonstrations.\n\nWhy-demonstrations may express why (i) a certain attribute holds of a\nsubject or (ii) both why it holds of that subject and why it exists.\nIn this connection, Avicenna aims to draw a distinction between two different kinds of\nexplanation. The fact that the attribute of having the sum of the internal angles\nequal to two right angles holds of isosceles triangles because they\nare triangles is an example of the first kind: the attribute is true of\nsomething in virtue of its being true of a per se 1 attribute (in this case its genus) of that thing. The fact that vines are deciduous because they are wide-leaved\nis an example of the second kind. The distinction is parallel to a\ndistinction proposed for Aristotle between application arguments and\nsubject-attribute demonstrations (McKirahan 1992). Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of per se fits neatly into this scheme, where case (aa)\ncorresponds to why-demonstration of type (ii), and case (ba)\ncorresponds to why-demonstrations of type (i) (Strobino\nforthcoming).\n\nThat-demonstrations are also divided into two types, depending on\nwhether the context is one in which there is (iii) a causal relation\nbetween subject and predicate or (iv) not. Case (iii) is the most\ncommon type of that-demonstration, which typically obtains when the\nmiddle term (in the first figure) is the effect of the existence of\nthe major instead of being its cause (the opposite of type-(ii)\nwhy-demonstration). Case (iv) is a peculiar kind of that-demonstration which Avicenna\nincludes to account for immediate predications where an attribute\ndirectly follows, without mediation, from something\u2019s essence,\nwhich is the only case in which a that-demonstration may be associated\nwith certainty; or for cases where two attributes that are both\neffects of a cause are used to prove one another of a subject\n(Strobino 2016a, forthcoming).\n",
