    "main_text": "The Regress Argument || A Revival of the Regress Argument\n1.3 A Revival of the Regress Argument\n\nA variety of actions\u2014say, remembering to check the car\u2019s\nblindspot when reversing\u2014can be intelligent even though they are\nnot intentional. Or one might manifest intelligence through\nprocesses\u2014e.g., by coming to understand a difficult\nproposition, without them even being actions. If one accepts that\nintelligent performances, whether intentional or not, are necessarily\nguided by knowledge-how, one might try to recast the regress argument\nby replacing AP with IPP (Weatherson 2017): \n\n\nIntelligent performance premise (IPP): For a\nperformance \u03a6, if one \u03a6s intelligently, one manifests\none\u2019s knowledge-how to \u03a6.\n\n\nNow it seems plausible that one\u2019s manifestation of propositional\nknowledge can be intelligent in some cases but not in others. For\nexample, one might manifest one\u2019s knowledge intelligently by\nbringing to bear one maxim that is appropriate instead of any other\nthat is not to the particular situation which the agent faces. By IPP,\nif one\u2019s manifestation of knowledge-that in a particular\nsituation is intelligent, it requires one\u2019s manifesting\none\u2019s knowledge-how. If intellectualism is true, that would in\nturn require manifesting one\u2019s knowledge-that. If this\nmanifesting of propositional knowledge is intelligent too, though\nunintentional, it requires knowledge-how. And so on. We get an\ninfinite regress if one accepts that manifesting propositional\nknowledge can be an intelligent performance, also when it is not an\nintentional action. (For similar lines of argument, see also Fridland\n2013, 2015; L\u00f6wenstein 2016: 276\u201380; Small 2017:\n62\u20133).\n\nIntellectualists might respond by distinguishing two senses\nin which a performance can be intelligent and two corresponding senses\nof manifestation, only one of which gives rise to the regress. First,\nan intelligent action might manifest one\u2019s knowledge-how in the\ncase that it is guided by this knowledge-how. On this\nreading, the regress is triggered. But there is also\nanother\u2014epistemic\u2014sense in which an intelligent action\nmanifests knowledge-how as long as it provides evidence for\nthat knowledge-how. For example, the rings on a tree provide evidence\nfor the tree\u2019s age (hence manifest its age in the epistemic\nsense) but the rings on a tree are not guided by its age. Crucially,\nthe regress does not arise on the epistemic sense of manifestation.\nChecking the blindspot might be intelligent in this epistemic sense of\nmanifesting \u2014providing evidence of\u2014knowledge-how. Yet,\nthis epistemic manifestation itself is not something that qualifies as\nintelligent or unintelligent.\n",
