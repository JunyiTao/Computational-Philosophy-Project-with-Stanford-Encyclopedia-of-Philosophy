    "main_text": "Recognition and Redistribution\n3. Recognition and Redistribution\n\n\nDespite the differentiation of these four dimensions of recognition,\nin the middle of the 1990s, Nancy Fraser (but also Rorty 1999) voiced\nthe concern that, at least in the political context of the US, the\nincreasingly influential \u201cidentity politics\u201d threatened to\nreplace the issue of redistribution on the political agenda. She\ninsisted\u2014against Taylor and Honneth\u2014that only\nrecognition and redistribution taken together would allow for\nthe right kind of justice, namely the ideal of \u201cparticipatory\nparity\u201d that guarantees each subject an equal participation in\npublic life. While redistribution secures the objective condition of\nsuch an ideal, recognition safeguards its intersubjective condition\n(Fraser 2003a, 36). Fraser tries to illustrate the independency of\nrecognition and redistribution by way of two examples: Whereas homosexuals\nsuffer primarily from culturally discriminating practices of\nhumiliation, workers are first and foremost the victims of economic\nexploitation. Though homosexuals also have to struggle with economic\ndisadvantages and the achievements of the workers have been\nideologically demeaned as less valuable, the real cause of the\ninjustice in the former case lies within the cultural sphere whereas in\nthe latter it lies within the economic sphere (Fraser 1996, ch. 1;\n2003a, 50\u201354). Thus, Fraser categorizes different forms of injustice\naccording to their socioeconomic roots. Her main point is, nonetheless,\nthat in most cases of injustice we are dealing with a combination of\ncultural disrespect and economic exploitation. As especially fitting\nexamples Fraser refers to groups categorized along the lines of gender\nor race. Thus, women and people of different color suffer not only\nfrom a discriminating status order, but also from an economy which is\nbased on encoding unpaid housework and badly paid labor as female as\nwell as auxiliary and superfluous work as colored. Only a\ntwo-dimensional theory such as the one she suggests can\u2014according to Fraser\u2014pay proper attention to practical conflicts\nbetween policies of redistribution and recognition. On the one hand, if\none redistributes without considering the relations of recognition\ninvolved, the receivers might be stigmatized as \u201csocial\nparasites,\u201d and thus disrespected. On the other hand, generally\nlegitimate policies of recognition may lead to normatively undesirable\nside-effects by dramatically worsening the economic position of the\naffected persons, as measures against reification through prostitution\nand pornography might very well do when they render those engaged in\nthese lines of work unemployed (Fraser 2003a, 65; see for a thorough\ndiscussion the contributions in Olsen 2008).\n\n\nIn light of this criticism, Axel Honneth has insisted that the\nconcept of recognition can be applied to questions of distributive\njustice, but that it is important to properly differentiate between the\ndimensions of respect and esteem: First, our understanding of what we\nowe to others on account of their equal status as autonomous persons\nhas itself been historically extended and now entails social rights.\nAccordingly, the affected persons can at least claim qua equal\ncitizens\u2014and thus in the name of a politics of respect\u2014that amount of basic goods that is necessary for enabling them to\neffectively use their legal entitlements. Secondly, they can refer to\nthe criterion of achievement which is supposed to be constitutive of\ncapitalism\u2014as an (also) cultural entity\u2014in order to\ndemand a more adequate remuneration of their work (Honneth 2003a,\n151\u2013154; see 2.3 above). Only if one understands redistribution in this\nway, that is, as a problem of recognition, can one\u2014according to\nHonneth\u2014explain why the affected experience outrage: namely\nbecause they deem their identity to be threatened by a perceived\ninjustice. What counts as an injustice, therefore, depends on our\nreasonable expectations of recognition: Justice and recognition\nmutually illuminate each other.\n\n\nHowever, Fraser has responded by arguing that most problems\nassociated with global injustice are not primarily due to\nmisrecognition but rather stem from systemic features of capitalism,\nsuch as when multinational enterprises relocate factories and lay off\nworkers in order to maximize profits and share-holder interests (Fraser\n2003b, 214\u2013215, see for Honneth\u2019s reply Honneth 2003b, 248\u2013249). Subsequently, there has been quite some debate with\nregard to what extent and how fruitfully global capitalism can be\nexplained and criticized in terms of recognition\u2014and what role\nfunctional imperatives play within such an account (see, for example,\nthe contributions in Schmidt am Busch/Zurn 2010, 241\u2013318, Honneth 2014, ch. 6.2, Honneth 2015, ch. III, J\u00fctten 2015).\n",
