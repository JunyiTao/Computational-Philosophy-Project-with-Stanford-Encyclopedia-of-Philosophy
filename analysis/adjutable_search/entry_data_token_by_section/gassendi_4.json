    "main_text": "Atomist Matter Theory\n5. Atomist Matter Theory\n\n\nThe core of Gassendi's mature philosophy and natural philosophy is his\natomist matter theory. He initially borrows on historical atomist\nsources\u2014primarily Epicurus\u2014but quickly integrates a range\nof atomist claims into his proposed empirically defensible complex of\nphysical, metaphysical, and ethical perspectives. Some aspects of his\natomism fit poorly with the mechanical philosophy it is supposed to\nexemplify. Yet Popkin is correct in suggesting that Gassendi's atomism\nis a premier instance of his philosophical and scientific pursuits\nconstituting one and the same project. The putative empirical support\ndoes not stand up to close inspection, and his particular brand of\nthis matter theory is inconsistent with other elements of the\nmechanical philosophy.  Nonetheless, his atomism provides an\ninnovative and consistent model for micro-level accounts of\nmacro-level physical structures and their behavior, throughout all\nmanner of natural, psychological, and social domains. In this last\nregard, Gassendi's views resemble those of his acquaintance, Hobbes,\nthough with greater attention to core physical details of the matter\ntheory, and fine-grained notions as to how the micro-mechanisms may\noperate.\n\n\nGassendi reveals atomist sympathies in his earliest works and\ncorrespondence, where he rejects much of the style and some of the\nsubstance of philosophy in the late Aristotelian tradition. Indeed,\nsome commentators see Gassendi as a thinker in the Renaissance mold\nwho simply lands on atomism as a central component of a broader\nEpicurean alternative system to the robust range of received\nAristotelian views.  However, though he shares most of Epicurus's\nclaims about atoms (and many Epicurean arguments for those claims),\nGassendi disagrees on key points. This suggests it is the merits of\nthe view itself, that it is the most likely physical hypothesis about\nthe underlying structure of matter, and not simply a general\nrestoration of Epicureanism, that leads him to atomism.\n\n\nThe broadest atomist claims Gassendi makes are rooted in his\nbackground metaphysics and rejection of the infinite divisibility of\nmatter. He grounds the finer points of his atomism\u2014regarding the\nqualities of atoms and their aggregates\u2014on observations,\nexperiment, and interpretations of the same, as well as his\nassessments of alternative perspectives on matter theory. Following the\nEpicurean model (with debts to Lucretius, Democritus, and others\nstill), he starts with a basic ontology of matter and void, and\ndevelops a thoroughgoing account of the physical world rooted in a\npicture of the inherent features of atoms. The general range of\nphenomena and entities for which Gassendi offers atomist accounts owes\nmuch to the ancients. Many of the particular explananda do not,\nthough, and a significant number of his explanatory arguments are his\nown, at least in part.\n\n\nGassendi introduces notions of absolute space and time according to\nwhich the universe is that which contains material Creation. In the\ncolloquial language of metaphysics, he lays out the \u2018floor\nplan\u2019 of his picture of the universe in which he understands God\nto place the \u2018furniture\u2019, namely, atoms and their\namalgams.  Space, time, accident, and substance are the basic and real\n(non-ideal) categories of existence: space and time are not modes of\nsubstance (see section ten). \u2018Matter\u2019 refers to substance\nthat exists in space and time. Indeed, it is the sole and unchanging\nstuff of physical things and so must exist as long as physical things\nexist. Gassendi wants bits of matter to have their distinctive\nqualities without the scholastic imposition of form. In particular, he\nproposes, matter has essential and accidental qualities, though we can\nonly know the accidental ones, through experience.\n\n\nAs for the containing space in which atoms reside, Gassendi offers\nempirical and apriori arguments on behalf of a void. He takes the\nbarometric experiments of his day, including his own at Toulon, to\ndemonstrate the existence of at least a partial, disseminated void.\nMoving beyond such empirical argument, he echoes ancient atomists'\nreasoning. Thus he rehearses the classical arguments that without\ndisseminated void between the parts of bodies, one cannot explain\ndivision and separation of matter at the level of basic particles, and\nthat without the inane coacervatum, one cannot explain the\nmotion of bodies through space.\n\n\nBoth atoms and the void are for Gassendi\n\u2018principles\u2019\u2014by which he apparently means\n\u2018primary element\u2019, following a Scholastic tradition. It\ndoes not follow from this, however, that they are both substantival in\nhis view. Whereas atoms are primary principles of material substance,\nvoids are non-substantival principles of separation in which bodies\nare located, and by which they are separated and have their particular\nsort of supra-atomic structure.\n\n\nTo establish that atoms are the primary principles or elements of\nmatter, Gassendi draws deeply on the well of ancient atomist argument.\nThis sort of \u2018historical evidence\u2019 or\n\u2018testimony\u2019 tolerably counts as one manner of support for\nphysical claims at the dawn of the early modern period. Given\nGassendi's pronounced empiricism, though, the degree of his reliance\non such testimony is surprising. He strikes an even more surprising\nanti-empiricist chord in the introductory chapter of his Physics\n(Physicae Prooemium), pondering a stipulative account of the\nnatural world that consists of the right physical postulates. In the\nend, though, this approach is unacceptable for Gassendi, as such a\nstipulative physics raises more questions than it answers. His\nalternative tack is a series of reasoned defenses of basic atomist\ntenets\u2014frequently, amplifications and restatements of Epicurean\nand Lucretian arguments\u2014including claims as to the existence and\nstatus of atoms as the primary material principles.\n\n\nTo take one example, Gassendi assumes material objects must have\nsome substratum composed of basic and indivisible elements\n(\u2018principles\u2019), and proposes that atoms, as the\nbest candidates for the role of substrata, are the material\nprinciples in question. To arrive at this first assumption, he follows\nEpicurus and Lucretius in adopting the Parmenidean dicta that nothing\ncomes from nothing and (conversely) that all matter must come from\nsomething. He further embraces the ancient view that those dicta\nentail a common substratum for all matter, as the composition and\nresolution of material things always yield matter. To establish that\natoms are the best candidates for serving as this common substratum,\nhe reasons that whatever would serve as matter's substratum\ncannot pass from existence. Moreover, elements of such substratum\nwould be incapable of passing from existence only if they were\nindivisible and thus had no void\u2014that is, were solid. Yet this\ncommon substratum cannot be featureless, formless primary matter, as\nthe Aristotelians propose. It should have some identifiable\nand unchanging features because such features are ineliminable from\nmatter. He concludes that all material objects must be composed of\nelemental particles sharing the features essential to matter\u2014and\nthe particles with those features just are atoms.\n\n\nIn a second line of Lucretian reasoning, Gassendi argues that atoms\nare the primary principles of matter on the grounds that some\nfundamental material elements must be impenetrable if we are to\naccount for varying degrees of resistance in macro-sized objects. He\nsuggests that since all material things resist pressure to some\nextent, they all have one or another degree of solidity. The only way\nto explain this range of solidity, or resistance to pressure, he\nclaims, is by supposing that the ultimate constituent elements of all\nbodies are not soft, which is guaranteed if they are all\nsolid. Otherwise, there could be no bodies harder than the softest\nones, for if the ultimate constituent elements were soft,\nthen more solid bodies could never be composed from them. From this he\nconcludes that all material things must be composed of maximally hard\nelements which, when put together with more empty space between them,\nyield softer bodies\u2014and, when put together with less empty space\nbetween them, yield harder bodies.\n\n\nAs in the previous line of reasoning, Gassendi seeks to establish that\nsome properties of macro-sized objects\u2014variable solidity here,\nimmutable materiality in his first argument\u2014require an\nunderlying atomic architecture. Unfortunately, the atomic account\noffered by the present argument also is not necessary to explaining\nthe macro-property\u2014for we can still have diverse degrees of\nresistance to pressure even if the basic elements of matter also range\nin degrees of solidity. Worse still, this account is not even\nsufficient to the task. Given that atomic size and the amount of\ninterparticulate void are also variable factors, different\ncombinations of these structural characteristics could yield identical\ndegrees of solidity across the otherwise very distinctive macro-level\nobjects they compose. Then varying atomic architectures is not\nsufficient for varying degrees of resistance to pressure in objects on\nthe macro scale.\n\n\nSuch arguments and objections aside, Gassendi focuses his greatest\nefforts to deny matter's infinite divisibility on the relevance of\nmathematical and geometrical considerations to physical accounts of\nmatter's ultimate or near-ultimate particles. While acknowledging the\nbroad conceptual parellel between physical and mathematical continua\nin ancient discussions (O I 262b), he warns against the mistaken\nnotion that physical magnitudes should be infinitely divisible just\nbecause mathematical magnitudes are (O I 263b). This last observation\nby itself fails to establish that atoms are actually divisible. Yet\nGassendi views this notion as the collapse of a major argument against\natomism. More generally, though, he is less swayed by any particular\narguments for or against atomism than he is by the merits and value of\ntaking atomism as a best working hypothesis, with which we may explain\na wide variety of shared properties among macro-sized objects\u2014as\nwell as those properties that differentiate them.\n\n\nA more fundamental task is the enumeration of atomic\nproperties. Gassendi distinguishes between two sorts: those properties\ninherent in and essential to all individual atoms, and those which are\na feature of atoms in groups. His list of inherent atomic features,\nwhich closely follows Epicurus's list, includes: extension, size\n(moles, or more recognizably, magnitudo), shape\n(figura), weight or mass (pondus), and solidity\n(soliditas). Relative to each of these features all atoms\ngenerally resemble one another, there being a limited range of sizes\nand weights. One exception is shape. In order to account for\ntremendous variety among natural objects, Gassendi claims, there must\nbe very many different types of atomic shapes (though not infinitely\nso), and many tokens of each type (again, not infinitely so).\n\n\nAnother notable feature of this list of properties is that it signals\nGassendi's rejection of the cartesian view that extension is\nsufficient to characterize what is essential to the least bit of\nmatter. Descartes is wrong, then, for the same reason that the\nScholastics are wrong to talk about featureless matter in the context\nof physical theory. As Gassendi argues, while we might abstractly\nconceive of matter with one feature such as extension (or none at all,\nper the Scholastics), matter cannot actually come into existence\nwithout the features that God assigns at Creation\u2014namely, size,\nshape, weight, and solidity.\n\n\nThe essential feature of atoms which does the most work in Gassendi's\nphysics\u2014and also generates the most difficulties\u2014is their\ninherent weight, which gives them an intrinsic, natural\ntendency to move. Given this tendency, atomic rest is either\nprovisionary or else an illusion. Atomic weight gives rise not only to\na simple capacity for constant motion, but also to a range of more\ncomplex behaviors, enabling atoms to \u201c\u2026disentangle\nthemselves, to free themselves, to leap away [prosiliendi, to\nspring out], to knock against other atoms, to turn them away\n[retundendi, to check], to move away from them, and similarly\n[they have] the capacity to take hold of each other, to attach\nthemselves to each other, to join together, to bind each other\nfast\u2026\u201d Three other facets of atomic motion merit our\nattention.  First, it must be the general tendency of atoms to move in\nstraight lines given that the atoms here do not feature the\nclinamen, or swerve (contrary to the Epicurean tradition,\nthough perhaps as Epicurus himself would say). Second, Gassendi\nproposes that God endows atoms with a robust set of capacities for\nmoving themselves to varying degrees\u2014leading some commentators\nto see Gassendi as a vitalist or animist. Finally, Gassendi subscribes\nto a seamless compositionality of matter and scalar invariance\nregarding the nature and laws of motion, each of which lead him into\nmurky waters. On the micro-level, he is committed to a constancy of\nmotion that cannot be permanently arrested, whereas on the\nmacro-level, he holds that a principle of inertia governs the motion\nand rest of all bodies.\n\n\nGassendi's compositionality thesis consists of the claim that the\nvaried combinations of atoms give rise to all manner of physical,\nchemical, and biological features of the world and the phenomena they\nexhibit. Two elements of this thesis are noteworthy. First, atoms\ncombine into particular molecular structures that correspond to\nparticular macro-level features and phenomena. This pre-Daltonian view\noffers no suggestion that diverse collections of atoms are the source\nof molecular variety. Yet this molecularism is novel all the same for\nthe broad suggestion that such micro-structures are intermediate-level\nbuilding blocks of macro-structures, and for the particular proposal\nthat the four Aristotelian basic elements be conceived of as molecular\naggregates. Second, molecular structures en gros behave in\nthe same ways as macro-level structures: they can be set in motion,\npulled, elongated, compressed, and so on. In the case of molecular\ncrystal structures, they can replicate, much as their macro-level\ncounterparts can. On the other hand, there are significant\ndissimilarities among atoms and molecules: motion, density, and\nelasticity are all points of difference, which suggest the difficulty\nof a unified and internally consistent matter theory, relative to\nphysical norms or laws. Yet Gassendi is confident that, at least in\nprinciple, the universe could have been created by God with any given\ncomposition of particles, as varying in size, shape, or any other\ndimension. This suggests that from that level of abstraction the laws\ngoverning motion (not contingencies for Gassendi) are intended to be\nscalar invariant. Even in cursory review, these tantalizing claims\nsuggest significant and controversial consequences of stipulating that\natoms have inherent weight and resulting tendencies to motion.\n\n\nA further hallmark of Gassendi's atomic and molecular theories is his\nsuggestion, following the views of early atomists (prominently\nLucretius), that some atoms are endowed with greater activity than\nothers. The varied activity of such special atoms, or semina\nrerum, gives rise to a differential dynamism in matter (of purely\nmaterialist nature), allowing for special organic structures, as well\nas growth of crystals. By contrast, neither atoms nor molecules are\nendowed with powers per se. Nor do atoms bear forces, though\ncertain forces such as gravity can be explained by reference to the\nbehavior of atoms. Chemical forces, on the other hand, have molecular\nexplanations.\n\n\nOne of the greatest challenges to Gassendi's atomism from an internal\nperspective is the seemingly quixotic nature of his search for\nempirical foundations for atomism. In his era there is not the barest\nhint of perceptually-derived knowledge of anything so small. There is,\nhe thinks, an empirically viable source of at least some claims\nconcerning atoms\u2014the indirect data of indicative signs. Yet the\ngeneral tenor of his characterization and defense of physical atomism\nsignals a departure from his customary empiricism. As in his defense\nof an indivisibility thesis, Gassendi relies foremost on reason, not\nexperience, to account for the origin and quantity of atoms and what\nhe takes to be their essential and inessential properties, their\ninternal impetus, motion, and causal role, and their contribution to\nthe motions and qualities we attribute to macrophysical objects. He is\nhardly to be faulted in this regard given the lack of direct empirical\nevidence available. Moreover, his responses to ancient and early\nmodern critics of atomism are firmly within their strategic\nbounds, as they typically rely on reasoned argument without appeal to\nempirical force.\n",
