    "main_text": "Falsafa: Neoplatonized Aristotelianism in the Islamic World || The Infinite and the Continuous\n2.2 The Infinite and the Continuous\n\nAlthough the above argument provides some of the medieval Arabic\naccounts of the form of motion as discussed within the\nfalsafa tradition, there are other causal factors and\nnecessary conditions involved in the analysis of motion. Some of the\nmost significant conditions are (1) the infinite (particularly as it\nappears in descriptions of the continuous, e.g., the continuous as\nwhat is potentially divisible infinitely), (2) place and, closely\nrelated to place, (3) void, and also (4) time.\n\nThe standard argument against the actual existence of the\ninfinite can be traced back at least as early as al-Kind\u012b and\nstretches throughout the entire classical period of Arabic or Islamic\nphilosophy up to at least as-Suhraward\u012b (al-Kind\u012b 1950, 115\u2013116 &\n202\u2013203; Avicenna 1983, III.8, 212\u2013214; id., 1985, IV.11,\n244\u2013246; Ibn B\u0101jja 1978, 36\u201337; Ibn T\u0323ufayl 1936,\n75\u201377; and as-Suhraward\u012b 1999,\n 44).[7]\n A simplified version of the argument runs as follows. Imagine two\nrigid beams, which cannot give way so as to stretch. Moreover, suppose\nthat these beams extend from the earth infinitely into space. Next,\nimagine that some finite length, x, is removed from one of\nthe beams, for instance, the distance between the earth and the end of\nour galaxy; call that beam from which x has been removed\nR. Now imagine that R is pulled toward the earth,\nand then is compared with the beam from which nothing had been\nremoved. Call that Original beam O. In this case, since the\nbeams are rigid, R could not have stretched so as to extend\nthe extra length x. Consequently, R must be less\nthan O by a length equal to x. Now imagine the two\nbeams lying side-by-side and compare them. Since they are\nside-by-side, either R corresponds exactly with O\nand so is equal to O in spatial extent, or R falls\nshort of O. On the one hand, if R does not fall\nshort of O but exactly corresponds with, and so is equal to,\nO, then R is not less than O. But it was\nposited that R is less than O by the length\nx, and so there is a contradiction. If, on the other hand,\nR falls short of O on the side extending into space,\nthen where it falls short of O is a limit of R, in\nwhich case R is limited on both the side extending into space\nand on the earth side. In that case, R is finite, but it was\nassumed to be infinite, another contradiction. In short, if an\nactually infinite extension could exist and can be shortened by some\nfinite amount (which is assumed as given), then the shortened amount\nmust be either equal to or less than the original infinite extension;\nhowever, either case leads to contradiction. Therefore, the premise\nthat gave rise to the contradictions, namely, an actually infinite\nextension could exist, must be rejected.\n\nAl-Kind\u012b went on to use the conclusion of this argument to maintain\nthat time itself must be finite and consequently that the period of\ntime during which the world has existed must be finite. Therefore, he\nconcluded on the basis of this argument that the world must have been\ncreated at some first moment of time and so is not eternal (al-Kind\u012b\n1950, 121\u2013122 & 205\u2013206). Al-Kind\u012b\u2019s argument for the\ntemporal finitude of the cosmos is also the same one preferred by\nadvocates of kal\u0101m, and is none other than the\n\u201cKal\u0101m Cosmological Argument,\u201d recently\nre-popularized by William Lane Craig (Craig, 2000). In opposition to\nal-Kind\u012b\u2019s application of the foregoing argument to time, most\nsubsequent philosophers in the falsafa tradition took the\nconclusion of the above argument to entail only that an actual\ninfinite magnitude or number of things could not exist, that is to\nsay, there cannot exist some wholly completed infinite all of whose\nparts exist at one and the same moment in time. In those cases where\nnot all of the magnitude or its parts exist together at a single\nmoment\u2014as in the case of time and its parts, the past, present\nand future\u2014then an infinite, they argued, could exist, albeit\nonly potentially.\n\nIn addition to offering a means of understanding the eternity of the\nuniverse, the notion of a potential infinite was also useful for many\nnatural philosophers in that it provided a way to explain the\ncontinuous. Although strictly speaking Arabic-speaking philosophers\nfollowed the definition of the continuous given by Aristotle in\nPhysics V 3, which is in terms of two touching limits\nbecoming one and the same, they nonetheless further glossed this\ndefinition in terms of being divisible into ever smaller portions\nwithout limit, that is, as being potentially divisible infinitely.\nClearly the notion of the continuous ran afoul of the atomists\u2019\narguments against continua, which we have seen above. In response to\nsuch arguments, the philosophers insisted that a continuous magnitude\nis properly speaking one and unified and as such it is not composed of\nan infinite number of parts and so does not have an actually infinite\nnumber of divisions (e.g., Avicenna 1983, III.2, 8\u201310). They\nfurther maintained that properly speaking one cannot even say that a\ncontinuous magnitude has an infinite number of potential divisions, at\nleast not in the sense that an infinite number of non-actualized\ndivisions exist latently in the continuous magnitude such that they\ncould ever all come to exist so as to be all actualized at once. For\nthe philosophers, there is no real sense that the divisions are in the\nmagnitude, whether actually or potentially; rather, the sense in which\na continuous magnitude is potentially divisible ad infinitum\nis that one can mentally posit accidental divisions within the\nmagnitude without end. These accidental divisions would be like the\nleft side when pointing to the left, and the right\nside when pointing to the right. There are not real left- and\nright-divisions within the magnitude apart from the positing. In other\nwords, nothing in the magnitude precludes or hinders one from mentally\npositing ever-smaller divisions. For example, think of 1/2, and 1/2\nagain, and so forth; however, those halves are not really or actually\nin the magnitude until unless one goes through the process of mentally\n(or even physically) marking them off. Consequently, when the\nphilosophers say that the continuous is potentially divisible\ninfinitely, they mean that it is impossible to complete the process of\ndivision such that the resultant is an actually infinite number of\nparts. Thus, there is an inherent contradiction in the theologians\u2019\nobjection that if the continuous is potentially divisible infinitely,\nthere must be a power, such as God, that can actualize all the\npotential divisions; for such an argument absurdly entails that what\nby definition cannot be completed is completed.\n",
