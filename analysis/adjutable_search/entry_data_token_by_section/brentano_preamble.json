    "main_text": "\n\nFranz Clemens Brentano (1838\u20131917) is mainly known for his work\nin philosophy of psychology, especially for having introduced the\nnotion of intentionality to contemporary philosophy. He made important\ncontributions to many fields in philosophy, especially to the\nphilosophy of mind, metaphysics and ontology, ethics, logic, the\nhistory of philosophy, and philosophical theology. Brentano was\nstrongly influenced by Aristotle and the Scholastics as well as by the\nempiricist and positivist movements of the early nineteenth century.\nDue to his introspectionist approach of describing consciousness from\na first person point of view, on one hand, and his rigorous style as\nwell as his contention that philosophy should be done with exact\nmethods like the natural sciences, on the other, Brentano is often\nconsidered a forerunner of both the phenomenological movement and the\ntradition of analytic philosophy. A charismatic teacher, Brentano\nexerted a strong influence on the work of Edmund Husserl, Alexius\nMeinong, Christian von Ehrenfels, Kasimir Twardowski, Carl Stumpf, and\nAnton Marty, among others, and thereby played a central role in the\nphilosophical development of central Europe in the early twentieth\ncentury.\n",
