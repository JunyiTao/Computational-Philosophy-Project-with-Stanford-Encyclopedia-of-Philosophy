The use of the\nplural\u2014\u201creconstructions\u201d\u2014is\nimportant. There is more than one way of rationally reconstructing\nhistory, and how you do it depends upon what you count as rational and\nwhat not\u2014it depends, in short, in your theory of rationality.\nThere is not one \u201crational history\u201d\u2014as Hegel may\nhave thought\u2014but several competing ones. And, in a remarkable\ndialectical turn, Lakatos proposed that one can evaluate competing\ntheories of rationality by asking how well they enable one to\nreconstruct the history of science (whether it be mathematics or\nempirical science). The thought is that if your philosophy of science,\nor theory of scientific rationality, deems most of \u201cgreat\nscience\u201d irrational, then something is wrong with it.\nContrariwise, the more of the history of \u201cgreat science\u201d\nyour theory of rationality deems rational, the better that theory\nis.\n\nThe obvious worry is that this meta-criterion for theories of\nscientific rationality threatens to deprive the philosophy of science\nof any critical bite. Will not the best philosophy of science simply\nsay that whatever scientists do is rational, that scientific might is\nright, that the best methodology is Feyerabend\u2019s \u201cAnything\ngoes\u201d? Lakatos\u2019s Kantian epigram \u201cPhilosophy of\nscience without history of science is empty; history of science\nwithout philosophy of science is blind\u201d threatens to eliminate\nthe philosophy of science altogether, in favour of\nhistorical-sociological studies of the decisions of scientific\ncommunities. (One of us discusses this problem, and attempts to disarm\nthe worry, in Musgrave 1983.)\n\nAnother worry, which is perhaps less obvious, is that Lakatos seems to\nbe implicitly appealing to the kind of inductive principle that he\nscorns elsewhere. Isn\u2019t he saying that a sequence of successes\nin the history of science displaying key episodes as rational tends to\nconfirm a theory of scientific rationality?\n\nLakatos himself was a master of philosophically inspired case-studies\nof episodes in the history of science\u2014Feyerabend said he had\nturned this into an art form. His \u201cHegelian\u201d idea that the\n\u201crationally reconstructed\u201d history of thought has primacy\nis emphasised in two books, Larvor 1998 and Kadvany 2001. After his\ndeath, a Colloquium was held in Nafplion, Greece, where case-studies\napplying Lakatos\u2019s ideas to episodes from the history of both\nthe natural and social sciences were presented by his students and\ncolleagues. The Proceedings of this \u201cNafplion Colloquium\u201d\nwere subsequently published in two volumes\u2014Howson (ed.) 1976 and\nLatsis (ed.) 1976. Further case-studies include Zahar 1973 and Urbach\n1974.\n\nHowever, Urbach\u2019s paper, which was written with Lakatos\u2019s\nactive collaboration and encouragement (F&AM: 348\u201334),\nrepresents something of an \u201cown goal\u201d for the MSRP. Urbach\nargued that the environmentalist programme in IQ Studies, which tries\nto explain intergroup differences in tested intelligence as due to\nenvironmental causes, was a degenerating research programme. At least\nit was degenerating when compared to its hereditarian rival which puts\nthese differences down to differences in hereditary endowments. The\ntables were dramatically turned just thirteen years later with the\ndiscovery of the Flynn effect (1987) which showed massive differences\nin intergroup IQs which simply could not be explained by\nhereditary differences. (The groups in question were genetically\nidentical, the higher scoring groups being the children or the\ngrandchildren of the lower scoring groups. See Flynn 1987 and 2009.)\nThus the supposedly \u201cdegenerate\u201d programme was propelled\ninto the lead. Of course the MSRP allows for such dramatic\nreversals of fortune, but it is at least a bit embarrassing if a\nprogramme damned as degenerate by both the Master and one of his chief\ndisciples is spectacularly vindicated just thirteen years later.\n",
