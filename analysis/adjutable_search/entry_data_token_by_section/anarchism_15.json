This\nobjection holds that anarchists are violent and destructive and that\nthey are intent on destroying everything, including morality\nitself.\n\nReply: This objection does not seem to recognize that\nanarchists come in many varieties. Many anarchists are also\npacifists\u2014and so do not advocate violent revolution. Many other\nanarchists are firmly committed to moral principles such as autonomy,\nliberty, solidarity, and equality. Some anarchists do take their\ncritique of arch\u00e9 in a nihilistic direction that\ndenies ethical principles. But one can be committed to anarchism,\nwhile advocating for caring communities. Indeed, many of the main\nauthors in the anarchist tradition believed that the state and the\nother hierarchical and authoritarian structures of contemporary\nsociety prevented human flourishing.\n",
