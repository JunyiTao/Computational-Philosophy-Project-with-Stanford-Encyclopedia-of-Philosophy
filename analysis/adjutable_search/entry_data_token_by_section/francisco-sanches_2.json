His two main targets\nwere (1) Francesco Giuntini\u2019s Discours sur ce que menace\ndevoir advenir la comete apparue \u00e0 Lyon le 12 de ce mois de\nNovembre de 1577. laquelle se voit encores \u00e0 present, a\ntreatise that proposed that the comet of 1577, and comets in general,\nwere prophetic phenomena of bad things to come, such as plagues and\nthe deaths of kings; and (2) Aristotelian notions of the heavens, the\nspheres, and the place of comets within this hierarchical,\nastronomical ontology.\n\nIt is indeed telling that Sanches begins the Carmen de cometa\nin a mocking and critical tone on the question of knowledge. He\nwrites: \n\n\nWhy do you pretend to know such profound things you, impulsive youth?\nTo what end do you pretend to know these things, you trembling old\nage? Thus I want to show above all else that the long-haired star\ncannot predict anything. And even if it could predict, it would not\nprovide any knowledge. It serves no purpose. So why want what is\nuseless? (CC: 143: 1\u20132; 146: 25\u201327, my translation) \n\n\nThis is the scepticism that frames the Poem of the Comet.\n\nFirstly, we have Sanches\u2019 view of comets, more or less derived\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s notions of the heavens and the place of comets\nwithin them. For Aristotle comets were celestial bodies inhabiting the\nspace between the Earth and the upper heavenly spheres. They were\ncreated by hot dry exhalation that emanated from the terrestrial\nsphere, and clashed, as it were, with the movement of the heavenly\nsphere (Meteorologica 344a8\u201333); or as Aristotle\nexplained: if the exhalation extended in all directions it was called\na \u201ccomet or long-haired star\u201d, and if it extended\nlengthwise only it was called a \u201cbearded star\u201d. \n\n\nNow when as a result of the upper motion there impinges upon a\nsuitable condensation a fiery principle which is neither so very\nstrong as to cause a rapid and widespread conflagration, nor no feeble\nas to be quickly extinguished, but which is yet strong enough and\nwidespread enough; and when besides there coincides with it an\nexhalation from below of suitable consistency; then a comet is\nproduced, its exact form depending on the form taken by the\nexhalation\u2014if it extends in all directions it is called a comet\nor long-haired star, if it extends lengthwise only it is called a\nbearded star. (344a15\u201326 51)\n\n\nThe fact, thereby, that comets were conceived objects of secondary\nimportance in the great hierarchy of the heavenly spheres, reduce\ntheir ontological significance for Sanches. How could such unimportant\nphenomena prophecy great events and determine the actions of rational\nbeings? Since comets were the product of dry exhalations \u201cwith\nexcessively weak forces\u201d that occurred at great distances from\nthe earth, they \u201ccould not be the cause of anything\u201d (CC:\n194: 658\u2013661, my translation). \u201cWhat could your\nlong-haired star achieve then? What can that minuscule breath with its\ndim light, transmit to us from the heights of the heavens\u201d (CC:\n666\u2013669). The answer for Sanches, as would be expected, was\n\u201cnihil\u201d. Nowhere was it observable that comets\nwere either signs or final causes (cf. Orden Jim\u00e9nez 2003) In\nshort, comets were not natural phenomena with consciousness that\n\u201cgave greater importance to kings than to common citizens\u201d\n(CC: 174\u2013174: 409\u2013410); and they certainly could not be\nthe cause of human actions, for then they would obviate free will.\n\n\n\nThe free mind is not subject to laws, and neither are its own acts: it\ncan turn either way; at times the soul turns to a certain thing, and\nat times to others\u2026Why do you persist that the long-haired\nstars can predict harmful arguments or cruel poisons in my life? No\none can foretell what is subject to free will. (CC: 170:\n336\u2013339, 342\u2013346) \n\n\nAnd he adds: \n\n\nReligion and the habits of our souls are free acts of our will. What\neffects can celestial bodies have on free acts? What is the relation\nbetween our mind and a bearded star? Celestial bodies have not been\ngiven any power over the mind\u2026. (CC: 171: 354\u2013359, my\ntranslation) \n\n\nReligion, and even more so, \u201cgood acts\u201d can only be\nattributable to free will. Or to put it another way, morality is\ncontingent on free will. If God were to put special powers into comets\nsuch that they could influence human actions, then comets\u2014these\nmaterial objects\u2014would be superior to humans. Humans would be\nthe playthings of comets, and \u201cgood acts\u201d qua\ndetermined acts would no longer be good. On the other hand, human acts\nwould be subject, to what in the Middle Ages was deemed as\n\u201cFortuna\u201d, predestination, and to some extent\nprovidence.\n\nFinally, there is Sanches\u2019 tacit criticism of a theory based on\nnothing more than a syllogistic argument that fails to prove any\nconnection between comets and human actions, not to mention, any\nconnection between the appearance of a comet as a cause, and its\nputative effects on human actions, death, harvests, and diseases. For\nhow many years could go by before a comet was witnessed, asked\nSanches, and still harvests failed, earthquakes rattled the earth, and\nkings died? Not to mention the fact that comets were often witnessed\nby certain peoples around the globe and not by others. Did that mean\nthat if the comet were only seen by the peoples of India, it would\nonly have an effect on that particular population, and not on the\npeoples of the south of France? If comets only predicted certain\nthings, one was left to ask: why these and not others? And what is\nmore, why could they not equally be the cause of good things?\n\u201cThere is no reason for it\u201d, says Sanches (CC: 186: 563).\nAnd as such, at the very core of Sanches\u2019 poem, lies the kernel\nof his scepticism. After all, the Poem of the Comet of 1577 and\nThat Nothing is Known were written at nearly the same time.\nIn this respect, Sanches\u2019 Poem is an attack on Ptolemaic\nastrology, which anticipated Pierre Gassendi\u2019s (1592\u20131655)\ncriticisms of astrology\u2019s vis-\u00e0-vis its threat to the\nnotion of free will (Sarasohn 1996: 99). Interestingly, Sanches and\nGassendi shared what Popkin calls a \u201cconstructivist\nscepticism\u201d (1964: 17); which in both cases resulted from their\nanti-Aristotelianism and scientific empiricism (Popkin 1964:\n86\u201387). As such, then, from this perspective, Carmen de\nCometa/Poem of the Comet ought to be considered one of\nSanches\u2019 philosophical works, and one which sheds light upon his\nmore popular Quod nihil scitur/That Nothing is Known.\n",
