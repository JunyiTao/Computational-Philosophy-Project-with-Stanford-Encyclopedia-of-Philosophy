Revising the Foundations of Deontic Logic\n\nWhen one meets a problem in formalizing certain aspects of reasoning\nvia a given formal system (e.g., SDL), one may diagnose the situation\nin two different ways: as caused by a lack of expressive power in the\nformalism, one that can be remedied by augmentation, or as a\nfundamental problem with the initial formalism itself calling for\nmodification or replacement of the initial formalism. In the present\nsection, we survey some attempts to revise the foundations of deontic\nlogic, in view of specific puzzles related to SDL and its\nextensions.\n6.1. J\u00f6rgensen\u2019s Dilemma and Procedural Semantics for Deontic Logic\n\nA view still held by some researchers within deontic logic and\nmeta-ethics, and particularly popular in the first few decades\nfollowing the emergence of positivism, was that evaluative sentences\nare not the sort of sentences that can be either true or false. If\nthat view is correct, we seem to be facing a dilemma. On the one hand,\nit seems there can be no logic of normative sentences, since logic is\nthe study of what follows from what, and one thing can follow from\nanother only if the things in question are of the sort that can be\neither true or false. So there can be no deontic logic. On the other\nhand, some normative sentences do seem to follow from others, and\nthere appear to be logical relations between distinct (possibly\nlogically complex) deontic statements, so there can be deontic logic\nafter all. What to do? This is J\u00f6rgensen\u2019s dilemma.\n\nA widespread distinction that was put forward in an attempt to\novercome the dilemma is that between a norm and a\nnormative\n proposition.[78]\n Consider a normative sentence such as \u201cYou may park here for\none hour\u201d. This sentence may be used by an authority to provide\npermission on the spot or it may be used by a passerby to report on an\nalready existing norm (e.g., a standing municipal regulation). The\nactivity of using a normative sentence as in the first case is\nsometimes referred to as \u201cnorming\u201d\u2014it creates a norm\nby granting permission by the very use of the sentence. The second use\nis often said to be descriptive, since the sentence is then not used\nto grant permission, but to report that permission to do so is a\nstanding state. It is often maintained that the two uses are mutually\nexclusive, and only the latter use allows for truth or falsity. Some\nhave however challenged the exclusiveness of the division, by blending\nsemantics and speech-act theory (especially regarding performatives).\nThey thereby suggest that one who is in authority to grant a\npermission can not only grant it by performing the speech act of\nuttering the relevant sentence (as in the first example), but also\nthereby makes what it said true\u2014 that the person is\npermitted to park (as in the second example with the\n passerby)).[79]\n\nIf one agrees that norm-propositions are distinct from norms, one may\ninsist that the realm of deontic logic is limited to\nnorm-propositions, perhaps interpreted with a standard semantics in\nterms of truth at possible worlds. Where some normative system, \\(n\\),\nis the basis in some state, \\(w\\), for a set of normative\npropositions, one could just say that \\(\\OB p\\) is true at a state,\n\\(w\\), in virtue of the fact that according to the norms in \\(n\\) that\napply in \\(w\\), \\(p\\) is required. However, this still leaves a\nJ\u00f6rgensenian gap: it remains unclear what it means that a set of\nnorms requires a certain state of affairs (given the way the world\ncurrently is). Isn\u2019t there still a need for a framework to model\nsystems of norms, their possible structural features, and how they\ngenerate normative propositions? If a normative system \\(n\\) requires\n\\(p\\) and \\(n\\) also requires \\(q\\), how does it do so, and\ndoes it then also require \\((p \\amp q)\\), and if so, in virtue of\nwhat features of\n \\(n\\)?[80]\n\nAn alternative route is to give up on truth-functional (possible\nworld) semantics. One may, e.g., assume a primitive notion of\n\u201cnorms\u201d (sometimes also called \u201cimperatives\u201d),\nwhich generate \u201cobligations\u201d in a purely syntactic\nfashion. Originating in the work on conflict-tolerant deontic logics\n(van Fraassen 1973, cf. Hansen 2008 and Hansen 2013), this route\nbecame most influential under the banner of Input/Output logic\n(Makinson & van der Torre 2000, 2001; Parent & van der Torre\n2013). The \u201csemantics\u201d of I/O-logics is purely\noperational: it specifies a set of obligations (propositional\nformulas) that result from the application of factual detachment to\n(a) a set of factual statements (closed under PC) and (b) a set of\nconditional norms, i.e., pairs of propositional formulas, closed under\na given set of logical rules, R. Variations regarding R give rise to\nvarious \u201cinput/output relations\u201d (hence, I/O-logics). See\nParent and van der Torre 2018 for a short primer.\n\nThe I/O-logic framework has proven useful in a number of respects: it\nputs factual detachment where, for many, it belongs: at the very core\nof deontic reasoning. It allows for many fine-grained distinctions and\nnuanced accounts of the interplay between detachment and logical\nreasoning about facts and norms that seem hard to characterize in\nterms of classical possible worlds-semantics. Finally, it can\naccommodate various notions of permission and their relation to\nobligation (Makinson & van der Torre 2003). On the downside, how\nto integrate a procedural semantics from I/O-logic with semantics for\nepistemic logics, logics of agency, and the like is far from obvious.\nMore generally, since in I/O-logic the notion of obligation\nis\u2014by definition\u2014one of an \u201coutput\u201d, it is\nunclear how, e.g., truth-functional connectives or other modal\noperators can be applied to statements concerning obligation (e.g., it\nis believed that murder is wrong and sometimes done), or what a nested\nstatement like \u201cit is permissible that it is obligatory that\np\u201d would mean in this\n framework.[81]\n6.2 Deontic Logic and Actions\n\nWe often apply terms such as \u201cmust\u201d, \u201cought\u201d,\nand \u201ccan\u201d to actions rather than to states of affairs. For\ninstance, we would say that \u201cJimmy must tie his\nshoelaces\u201d, rather than \u201cit is obligatory (for Jimmy) that\nJimmy\u2019s shoelaces are tied\u201d. Likewise, we make claims such\nas \u201cJack must get the groceries\u201d and \u201cyou can turn\nleft here\u201d. In each of these three examples, it seems we signal\nthe deontic status of a certain action\u2014 an agent-initiated\nway of changing the current world, or bringing it into a\ndifferent state. However, the by now common reading of\nSDL\u2014deviating from von Wright\u2019s original interpretation\n(recall\n supplement B, von Wright\u2019s 1951a System and SDL),\n has it that we can always apply the deontic modals to propositions\ninstead.\n\nVarious semantics have been developed in which deontic terms are\napplied directly to actions, conceived as transitions between states\nin a Kripke-model. For instance, following the reduction of SDL to\nalethic modal logic (cf.\n Section 3),\n Meyer 1988 adds an Andersonian \u201cviolation\u201d constant V to\n propositional dynamic logic\n (PDL). In this framework, [\\(\\alpha\\)]V expresses that executing the\naction \\(\\alpha\\) necessarily leads to a violation, hence,\n\u201c\\(\\alpha\\) is forbidden\u201d. Where \\(-\\alpha\\) denotes the\nnegation of action \\(\\alpha\\), [\\(-\\alpha\\)]V then represents that\n\\(\\alpha\\) is\n obligatory.[82]\n Note that intuitively, this formula can be read as: \u201cwhenever\n\\(\\alpha\\) is not carried out, a violation occurs\u201d.\nAlternatively, one may define a notion of strong\npermissibility of an action \\(\\alpha\\), by introducing a Kangerian\nconstant \u201cOK\u201d and expressing that \\(\\alpha\\) is strongly\npermissible by [\\(\\alpha\\)]OK. This means, intuitively, that whenever\none executes the action \\(\\alpha\\), then one is guaranteed to end up\nin a world that is deontically acceptable (no violation\n occurs).[83]\n\nMeyer\u2019s analysis reduces the deontic status of a given action\n(at a given state w) to the occurrence of violations in its terminal\nstates (reachable from w through that action), giving rise to\nso-called \u201cgoal norms\u201d. In contrast, one may also consider\n\u201cprocess norms\u201d that concern all the intermediate states\nthat are \u201cpassed by\u201d when carrying out a given action at a\nstate. Deontic logics of the latter type have been proposed in van der\nMeyden 1996; see Broersen 2004, Kulicki and Trypuz 2017, Canavotto and\nGiordani 2019 for discussions of this distinction.\n\nA different approach to actions in deontic logic originates in\nSegerberg 1982, and further developed inter alia in Kulicki\nand Trypuz 2017. Here, a Boolean algebra of actions is\nproposed\u2014analogous to the Boolean algebra of PC\u2014and one\ndefines functions that specify which (basic and complex) actions are\npermissible, forbidden, or required. An expression like \u201c\\(P\n\\alpha\\)\u201d then just means that \\(\\alpha\\) is a member of the set\nof permitted actions, and such expressions are used to build more\ncomplex ones using classical propositional connectives. Whereas in\ndynamic deontic logic, the deontic behavior of complex actions is\ngoverned by the underlying logic of actions (i.e., PDL), in deontic\nlogics over Boolean action algebras, specific frame conditions are\nimposed to ensure that, e.g., \u201caction \\(\\alpha\\) is\nforbidden\u201d entails that \u201cdoing \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n(say, simultaneously) is\n forbidden\u201d.[84]\n6.3 Rejecting Core Principles of SDL: OB-NEC and OB-RM\n\nRather than questioning its semantic foundations on their own terms,\none may also argue against SDL in view of the logical principles it\nvalidates. Here we outline a number of distinct arguments and examples\nthat have been raised against specific principles of SDL, after which\nwe show how some of these can be overcome by moving to weaker\nsystems.\n\nLet us start with \\(\\OB\\)-NEC. This rule requires that any\ntautological statement is obligatory. Now consider the following\nstatement:\n\n(1)\nNothing is obligatory.\n\n\nIt seems that what (1) expresses, an absence of obligations, is\npossible. For example, consider a time when no rational agents existed\nin the universe. Why should we think that any obligations\u2014even\nthose pertaining to tautological states of affairs\u2014existed\n then?[85]\n\nIf we are reading \\(\\OB\\) as simply \u201cit ought to be the case\nthat\u201d, it is not clear that there is anything counterintuitive\nabout \\(\\OB \\top\\) (now read as, essentially, \u201cit ought to be\nthat contradictions are false\u201d), but there is also no longer any\nobvious connection to what is obligatory or permissible for that\nreading, or to what people ought to do. A different way of avoiding\nthe counterintuitive consequences of \\(\\OB\\)-NEC is by distinguishing\nbetween \u201cvacuous\u201d obligations such as \\(\\OB (p \\vee \\neg\np)\\) and those that require the satisfaction of some logically\ncontingent statement such as \\(\\OB (p \\amp \\neg q)\\). This can, e.g.,\nbe done by enriching one\u2019s language with a modal operator\n\\(\\Box\\) for \u201csettled true\u201d (cf. Belnap 2001 et al., Horty\n2001).\n\nNext on the list of problematic principles is \\(\\OB\\)-RM, also known\nas the principle of Inheritance. This principle states that whenever\nsomething is obligatory, then everything that is a logical consequence\nis also obligatory (\u201cinherits\u201d that status). There are\nvarious well-known examples highlighting problems with \\(\\OB\\)-RM. The\nearliest and most well-known challenge to RM is Ross\u2019s\nParadox (Ross 1941). From\n\n(1)\n\u201cIt is obligatory that the letter is mailed\u201d\n\n\nformalized as \\(\\OB m\\), we can derive:\n\n(2)\n\u201cIt is obligatory that the letter is mailed (m) or the\nletter is burned (b).\u201d\n\n\nFormalized as \\(\\OB(m \\vee b)\\). It seems rather odd to say that an\nobligation to mail the letter entails an obligation to mail the letter\nor burn it (where burning the letter is presumably forbidden), one\nthat can be fulfilled by burning the letter, which invites from the\noffender: \u201cWell at least I did one thing right by burning\nit\u201d.\n\nWhile weakening from \\(m\\) to \\(m \\vee b\\) gives problems, similar\nissues arise when we weaken a conjunction to one of its conjuncts.\nThis is illustrated by the famous Good Samaritan Paradox\n(Prior\n 1958):[86]\n\n(1)\nIt is obligatory that Jones help Smith who has been robbed.\n(2)\nIt is obligatory that Smith has been robbed.\n\n\nSupposing that Jones helps Smith who has been robbed if and only if\nJones helps Smith and Smith has been robbed, it would appear that a\ncorrect way to symbolize (1) and (2) in SDLs is: \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1'\\)} \\OB (h \\amp r) \\] \\[\\tag{\\(2'\\)} \\OB r\\]\n\n\nBy \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB(h \\amp r)\\) entails \\(\\OB r\\). However, it hardly\nseems that if helping the robbed man is obligatory it follows that his\nbeing robbed is likewise\n obligatory.[87]\n A much-discussed, epistemic variant of the Good Samaritan is\ndiscussed in supplement F,\n the Paradox of Epistemic Obligation.\n\nThere have been various responses to these RM-related paradoxes. Some\ndefend RM and blame the Ross paradox on an elementary confusion\n(F\u00f8llesdal & Hilpinen 1971) or cite pragmatic features to\nexplain away the puzzle (Casta\u00f1eda 1981): no one would, e.g.,\nmerely utter the statement that John ought to mail or burn the letter,\nknowing that in fact John ought to just mail the letter. Similarly, it\nhas been argued that the Good Samaritan paradox is really a\nconditional obligation paradox, and so RM is not the real source of\nthe paradox (Casta\u00f1eda 1981; Tomberlin 1981). However, since\nthese paradoxes all at least appear to depend on \\(\\OB\\)-RM,\na natural solution to the problems is to undercut the paradoxes by\nrejecting \\(\\OB\\)-RM itself. Two accessible and closely related\nexamples of approaches to deontic logic that reject \\(\\OB\\)-RM from a\nprincipled philosophical perspective are Jackson 1985 and Goble\n 1990a.[88]\n A third, somewhat different principled strategy is proposed in\nCariani 2013 and studied in formal detail in Van De Putte 2019.\nFinally, in S. O. Hansson 1990, and more elaborately in Hansson 2001,\nS.O. Hansson develops systems of deontic logic where he analyzes\nprohibitive and prescriptive deontic notions in terms of abstract\nproperties of various preference orderings (e.g., a normative status\nis prohibitive whenever anything worse than something that has that\nstatus also has it). He also sees \\(\\OB\\)-RM as the main culprit in\nthe paradoxes of standard deontic logic, and thus he methodically\nexplores non-standard frameworks where \\(\\OB\\)-RM is not\n sound.[89]\n\nOne very general semantic framework for logics that can invalidate\nnecessitation, inheritance, or other principles of normal modal logics\nis the neighborhood semantic\n framework.[90]\n , A neighborhood semantics works with a set of possible worlds (just\nlike Kripke-semantics) but replaces the accessibility relation with a\nneighborhood function \\(\\rN\\) that maps every world \\(w\\) onto a set\nof sets \\(X, Y,\\ldots\\) of possible worlds \\(\\rN(w)\\), often thought\nof as a set of propositions. On such a semantics, \\(\\OB p\\) is true at\na world \\(w\\) iff the set of all \\(p\\)-worlds is in the neighborhood\nof \\(w\\), i.e. \n\n\\[ M, w \\vDash \\OB p \\textrm{ iff } |p| \\in \\rN(w) \\]\n\n\nOn the weakest logic characterized by such neighborhood models (the\nminimal \u201cclassical modal logic\u201d, E), only \\(\\OB\\)-RE is\nvalid. Additional validities and rules can be obtained by imposing\nspecific conditions on the neighborhood functions. Furthermore,\nneighborhood semantics can be naturally generalized to deal with\nconditional obligations (Chellas 1974, 1980), and combined with\nsemantic accounts of related concepts such as agency and ability\n(McNamara 2019). It can also accommodate conflict-tolerant logics, as\nwe will see next.\n6.4 Deontic Dilemmas and Conflict-Tolerant Deontic Logics: Rejecting NC\n\nA conflict of obligations is a situation where there are two\nor more obligations and it is not possible for all of them to be\nfulfilled. A specific, paradigmatic case is the one where we have two\nobligations that are logically incompatible, such as:\n\n(1)\nIt is obligatory that I now meet Jones (say, as promised to Jones,\nmy friend).\n(2)\nIt is obligatory that I now do not meet Jones (say, as promised to\nSmith, another\n friend).[91]\n\n\nHere it would seem that I have a conflict of obligations, in fact a\nquite direct and explicit one, since what I promised one person would\nhappen, I promised another would not happen. People do (e.g., under\npressure or distraction) make conflicting promises (cf. conflicting\nappointments), and it appears that they incur conflicting obligations\nas a\n result.[92]\n But consider the natural representation of these in SDLs:\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(1'\\)} \\OB j\\] \\[\\tag{\\(2'\\)} \\OB \\neg j\\]\n\n\nThese premises are inconsistent in SDL. First, they are simply\nexcluded by NC \\((\\OB p \\rightarrow \\neg \\OB \\neg\n p)\\).[93]\n But merely giving up NC is not sufficient. In fact, any normal modal\nlogic (hence, any logic that contains K and Necessitation, or\nequivalently, \\(\\OB\\)-RM, \\(\\OB\\)-C, and RE based on PC) will generate\ndeontic explosion:\n\n(DEX)\nFor every \\(p, q: \\OB p, \\OB \\neg p \\vdash \\OB q\\).\n\n\nIn effect this means that once one has conflicting obligations,\neverything is obligatory. Apart from this trivializing aspect, the\nvalidity of \\(\\OB\\)-RM and \\(\\OB\\)-C also means that having two\nincompatible obligations implausibly reduces to having a single\nself-contradictory obligation, cf.\n supplement G, Collapse of conflicts into impossible obligations.\n\nAs for \\(\\OB\\)-N and \\(\\OB\\)-RM, this problem can be tackled in\nvarious ways. Let us start with those who develop conflict-tolerant\ndeontic logics, by giving up one or more of the aforementioned\nprinciples. This gives rise to three distinct classes of such\nlogics:\n\nNon-aggregative deontic logics, which invalidate\n\\(\\OB\\)-C (aka the Aggregation rule for OB). Here, the classical\nexample is the logic \\(\\bP\\) (see, e.g., Goble 2003), which is\ncharacterized by various semantics that weaken specific features of\nSDL\u2019s possible worlds-semantics.\nInheritance-free deontic logics, or logics that only\nsatisfy a weakened form of \\(\\OB\\)-RM. Here, Goble\u2019s DPM-systems\n(Goble 2005) are particularly well-studied.\nParaconsistent (and possibly relevant) deontic logics,\nwhich refute the Ex Falso Quodlibet principle that underlies\ndeontic explosion. These logics preserve the full \u201cmodal\npart\u201d of SDL, at the cost of giving up on classicality for\nnegation. Semantically, they require non-classical (or so-called\n\u201cimpossible\u201d) worlds in which, e.g., both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg\np\\) can be true.\n\n\nHowever, giving up on any of these three principles may be too\ndrastic. Suppose, e.g., that, apart from the obligations (1) and (2)\nmentioned above, I also face the obligation to visit Tom (\\(t\\)), and\nin case I visit Tom, to hand him over a letter from Jane (\\(l\\)). So\nwe have as premises \\(\\OB j\\), \\(\\OB \\neg j\\), \\(\\OB t\\), \\(\\OB (t\n\\rightarrow l)\\). Suppose moreover that \\(t\\) and \\(l\\) are perfectly\ncompatible with either of \\(j\\) or \\(\\neg j\\). Then any of the three\nabove-mentioned strategies would still invalidate the inference to\n\\(\\OB l\\): we can no longer infer that I ought to hand over the\nletter.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that by using a non-monotonic\nframework such as adaptive logics, one can accommodate deontic\nconflicts and yet retain most of the inferential power of SDL. The\nrough idea behind this account is that one only rejects certain\nprinciples of SDL when they concern obligations that are in fact\nconflicted (in view of the premises). See Goble 2013 and Van de Putte,\nBeirlaen, and Meheus forthcoming for an overview of such adaptive\ndeontic logics.\n\nAnother shortcoming of most existing conflict-tolerant deontic logics\nis that they only focus on the above-mentioned paradigmatic case of\nbinary conflicts between logically contradictory obligations. In\ncontrast, conflicts often arise between obligations that are just\nincompatible in view of the circumstances one finds oneself in, and\nhence have a contingent\n basis.[94]\n In principle, SDL would be perfectly fine with such\n\u201ccontingent\u201d conflicts, and we could express them in an\nenriched language by formulas of the type \n\n\\[\\tag{DC} \\OB p \\amp \\OB q \\amp \\neg \\Diamond(p \\amp q)\\]\n\n\nHowever, (DC) in combination with (\\(\\OB\\)-C) yields triviality as\nsoon as we endorse a minimalistic version of Kant\u2019s law that\nought implies can: \n\n\\[\\tag{OiC} \\OB p \\rightarrow \\Diamond p\\]\n\n\nSimilar problems arise if we try to formalize contingent deontic\nconflicts following the Andersonian-Kangerian reduction, as shown in\n supplement H, A puzzle surrounding Kant\u2019s law.\n\nLet us note that a long-ignored and challenging further puzzle for\nconflicting obligations, sometimes called \u201cvan Fraassen\u2019s\nPuzzle\u201d and inspired by van Fraassen 1973 has deservedly\nreceived increased attention: Horty 1994, 2003; van der Torre and Tan\n2000; McNamara 2004a; Hansen 2004; and Goble 2005. For a brief general\noverview, see Section 8.4 of Hilpinen and McNamara 2013.\n\nAn altogether different approach towards conflicting obligations\nconsists in distinguishing between prima facie (or pro\ntanto) obligations, and all-things considered (pro toto)\nobligations, and insisting that SDL and its siblings are logics of the\nlatter notion. This distinction has been famous at least since (Ross\n1939). It can be illustrated by Plato\u2019s Dilemma (Lemmon\n 1962a):[95]\n\nI\u2019m obligated to meet you now for a light lunch meeting at\nthe restaurant.\nI\u2019m obligated to rush my choking child to the hospital.\n\n\nHere we seem to have an indirect non-explicit conflict of obligations,\nif we assume that satisfying both obligations is practically\nimpossible. Yet, unlike in our prior example, where the two promises\nmight naturally have been on a par, we would all agree that the\nobligation to help my child overrides my obligation to meet\nyou for lunch. In other words, the first obligation is\ndefeated by the second obligation, which takes\nprecedence. Ordinarily, we would also assume that no other\nobligation overrides my obligation to rush my child to the hospital,\nso that this obligation is an all things considered non-overridden\nobligation, but not so for the obligation to meet you for lunch.\nFurthermore, we are also prone to say that the situation is one where\nthe general obligation we have to keep our appointments (or to keep\nour promises, still more generally) has an\nexception\u2014the circumstances are extenuating.\n\nIf we define an \u201cobligations dilemma\u201d as a conflict of\nobligations where neither of the conflicting obligations is overridden\n(cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 1988), then the case above involves a conflict\nof obligations but not an obligations dilemma. Once we acknowledge\nconflicts of obligation, there is the further issue of representing\nthe logic of reasoning about conflicting obligations where some do or\ndon\u2019t override others, some are or are not defeated, some are,\nsome are not all things considered non-overridden obligations, where\nobligation dilemmas do or don\u2019t exist, where some obligations\nhold generally, but not unexceptionally, some are absolute, etc. So a\ncentral issue here is that of conflicting obligations of different\nweight and the defeasibility of obligations. Clearly,\nthere is no mechanism in SDL for this, since SDL does not allow for\nconflicts to begin with, yet this is an issue that goes well beyond\nthat of merely having a logic that allows for conflicts. There have\nbeen a variety of approaches to this dilemma, and to defeasibility\namong conflicting\n obligations.[96]\n6.5 Hyperintensionality of Deontic Modals and Truthmaker Semantics\n\nRecently, the puzzles related to \\(\\OB\\)-NEC, Inheritance, and Deontic\nExplosion have been taken to reflect a more general (alleged) feature\nof deontic modals, i.e., their hyperintensionality. In the\nsyntactic sense, a modal operator is hyperintensional if it is not\nclosed under the replacement of classical, truth-functionally\nequivalent formulas. On this view, \\(\\OB p\\) is, e.g., not equivalent\nto \\(\\OB\\) \\(((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q))\\), even if the truth of\n\\(p\\) always coincides with the truth of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg\nq)\\). Semantically, this means that such an operator cannot be\ninterpreted as an intensional modal operator, using (classical)\npossible-worlds semantics.\n\nA promising recent semantic framework for hyperintensional logics is\nthat of truthmaker semantics (Fine 2017). On such a semantics,\npropositions are interpreted by \u201ctruthmakers\u201d, resp.\n\u201cfalsemakers\u201d rather than sets of worlds, where these\nentities are related to one another in terms of a mereological\n(parthood) relation. For instance, a truthmaker for \u201cit\nrains\u201d would be simply a state of it\u2019s raining, nothing\nless and nothing more. A truthmaker for \u201c(it rains and the sun\nshines) or (it rains and the sun does not shine)\u201d can be either\nof two things: a fusion of a state of it\u2019s raining with a state\nof the sun\u2019s shining, or a fusion of a state of it\u2019s\nraining with a state of the sun\u2019s not shining (and hence, the\nlatter, a falsemaker of \u201cthe sun shines\u201d). Formally, the\nset of truthmakers of \\(p\\) may, e.g., be \\(\\{X, X'\\}\\), while the set\nof truthmakers of \\((p \\amp q) \\vee(p \\amp \\neg q)\\) may be \\(\\{X*Y,\\)\n\\(X*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z,\\) \\(X'*Z\\}\\), with the \u201c*\u201d symbol\ndenoting a fusion\n operation.[97]\n Fine applied this framework to the logic of imperatives and to\ndeontic logic proper in a series of papers (Fine 2018a,b) where\n\u201cactions\u201d play the role usually played by truthmakers in\nthe semantics of indicative sentences, and analogous to the\ntruthmaking and falsemaking relations between truthmakers and\npropositions, such actions can be either in compliance with or\ncontravening a given command. For instance, the imperative \u201cSing\nor dance!\u201d is interpreted in terms of (a) the actions that are\nin (exact) compliance with it, and (b) the actions that are in (exact)\ncontravention of it. For the case of conditional obligations,\nadditional complications arise, as one may also avoid a\nconditional by making its antecedent\n false.[98]\n Similar ideas, though worked out in different ways, can be found in\nAnglberger and Korbmacher 2020, which also relate truthmaker semantics\nto Goble\u2019s logic BDL from Goble 2013. For a full-fledged\ndiscussion of the hyperintensionality of normativity and formal\napproaches to it, see Faroldi 2019.\n7. Conclusion\n\nPlainly, there are a number of outstanding problems for deontic logic.\nSome see this as a serious defect; others see it merely as a serious\nchallenge, even an attractive one. There is some antecedent reason to\nexpect that the challenges will be great in this area. Normativity is\nchallenging generally, not just in deontic logic. Normative notions\nappear to have strong pragmatic features. Normative notions must\ncombine with notions for agency and with temporal notions to be of\nmaximal interest\u2014which introduces considerable logical\ncomplexity. There is also reason to think that there are hidden\ncomplexities in the interaction of normative notions and conditionals.\nFinally, there appears to be a wide array of normative notions with\ninteresting interactions, some easily conflated with others (by\nethicists as much as deontic logicians). Clearly, there is a lot of\nwork to be done.",
