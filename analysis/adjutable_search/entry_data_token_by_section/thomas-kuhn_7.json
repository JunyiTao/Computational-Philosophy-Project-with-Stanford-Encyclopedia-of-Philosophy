    "main_text": "Incommensurability and World-Change || Kuhn\u2019s Later Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\n4.4 Kuhn\u2019s Later Semantic Incommensurability Thesis\nAlthough Kuhn asserted a semantic incommensurability thesis in\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions he did not there\narticulate or argue for the thesis in detail. This he attempted in\nsubsequent work, with the result that the nature of the thesis changed\nover time. The heart of the incommensurability thesis after The\nStructure of Scientific Revolutions is the idea that certain\nkinds of translation are impossible. Early on Kuhn drew a parallel\nwith Quine\u2019s thesis of the indeterminacy of translation (1970a, 202;\n1970c, 268). According to the latter, if we are translating one\nlanguage into another, there are inevitably a multitude of ways of\nproviding a translation that is adequate to the behaviour of the\nspeakers. None of the translations is the uniquely correct one, and in\nQuine\u2019s view there is no such thing as the meaning of the words to be\ntranslated. It was nonetheless clear that Quine\u2019s thesis was rather\nfar from Kuhn\u2019s thesis, indeed that they are incompatible. First, Kuhn\nthought that incommensurability was a matter of there being no fully\nadequate translation whereas Quine\u2019s thesis involved the availability\nof multiple translations. Secondly, Kuhn does believe that the\ntranslated expressions do have a meaning, whereas Quine denies\nthis. Thirdly, Kuhn later went on to say that unlike Quine he does not\nthink that reference is inscrutable\u2014it is just very difficult to\nrecover (1976, 191). \nSubsequently, Kuhn developed the view that incommensurability\narises from differences in classificatory schemes.  This is taxonomic\nincommensurability. A field of science is governed by a taxonomy,\nwhich divides its subject matter into kinds. Associated with a\ntaxonomy is a lexical network\u2014a network of related terms. A\nsignificant scientific change will bring with it an alteration in the\nlexical network which in turn will lead to a re-alignment of the\ntaxonomy of the field. The terms of the new and old taxonomies will\nnot be inter-translatable.\nThe problematic nature of translation arises from two\nassumptions. First, as we have seen, Kuhn assumes that meaning is\n(locally) holistic. A change in the meaning of one part of the lexical\nstructure will result in a change to all its parts. This would rule\nout preservation of the translatability of taxonomies by redefining\nthe changed part in terms of the unchanged part. Secondly, Kuhn adopts\nthe \u2018no-overlap\u2019 principle which states that categories in\na taxonomy must be hierarchically organised: if two categories have\nmembers in common then one must be fully included within the other;\notherwise they are disjoint\u2014they cannot simply overlap. This\nrules out the possibility of an all-encompassing taxonomy that\nincorporates both the original and the changed taxonomies.  (Ian\nHacking (1993) relates this to the world-change thesis: after a\nrevolution the world of individuals remains as it was, but scientists\nnow work in a world of new kinds.)\nKuhn continued to develop his conceptual approach to\nincommensurability. At the time of his death he had made considerable\nprogress on a book in which he related incommensurability to issues in\ndevelopmental psychology and concept acquisition.\n",
