    "main_text": "Applications and Other Related Notions || Supervenience\n6.1 Supervenience\n\nThe notion of supervenience is covered in more detail in the separate\nentry on\n supervenience\n (see especially \u00a73.5) but a brief mention is in order here, as\nsupervenience has sometimes been conceived as a type of dependence.\nOne reason for this is that when we assert that A supervenes on\nB, we might also say that A-properties ontologically\ndepend upon B-properties. Take the typical example of the\nbeauty of a work of art and the physical manifestation of that work of\nart. It would seem that if you wish to change the aesthetic properties\nof an artwork, you will also have to manipulate its physical\nmanifestation. As a first pass, it looks as if the dependence at work\nhere is generic existential dependence as defined by\n (EDG),\n so the aesthetic A-properties dependG for their\nexistence upon some physical B-properties. However,\nsupervenience in general is not so easily analyzed, as at least on one\nusual conception, supervenience is not irreflexive and hence not\nasymmetric (see Steinberg 2013). In other words, we can at least say\nthat supervenience, as opposed to grounding, is not a strict partial\norder and hence not a relation of ontological priority. There are\nvarious ways to further specify the formal features of supervenience,\nand indeed to argue that it should not be considered as a form of\ndependence, but this is not a task that we can undertake here.\n",
