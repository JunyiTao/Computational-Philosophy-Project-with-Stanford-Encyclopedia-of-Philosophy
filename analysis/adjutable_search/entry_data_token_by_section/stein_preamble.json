    "main_text": "\n\nEdith Stein (1891\u20131942) was a realist phenomenologist associated\nwith the G\u00f6ttingen school and later a Christian metaphysician.\nShe was a Jew who converted to Catholicism in 1922 and was ordained a\nCarmelite nun in 1933. She died in Auschwitz in 1942. She was\nsubsequently declared a Catholic martyr and saint. She campaigned\npublicly on issues relating to women\u2019s rights and education.\nStein is known philosophically primarily for her phenomenological work\non empathy and affectivity, her contributions as research assistant to\nEdmund Husserl, and her philosophical anthropology. She was in\ndiscussion with leading philosophers of her day, including Husserl,\nScheler, Heidegger, Conrad-Martius, Ingarden, and Maritain. Her work\ncontains original approaches to empathy, embodiment, the emotions,\npersonhood, collective intentionality, and the nature of the state. In\nher later work, Stein developed an original philosophy of being and\nessence that integrated Husserlian phenomenology and Thomist\nmetaphysics.\n",
