    "main_text": "What do genes and DNA do? || Using a broadly biological concept of information to explain what genes do\n5.2  Using a broadly biological concept of information to explain what genes do\n\n\nJablonka's aim is to construct a general definition of information\nthat recognizes different types of information associated with\ndifferent ways of acquiring, replicating, and transmitting information\nthrough space and time (Jablonka 2002).  One of her concerns is that\ndiscussions about the meaning (or non-meaning) of information talk in\nbiology are biased by the assumption that the genetic system should\nserve as the prototype for thinking about biological information. She\nbelieves that a general definition of information, one designed to\ncapture the senses of information exemplified in environmental cues,\nman-made instructions, and evolved biological signals, as well as the\nsense of information in hereditary material, will lead to more useful\ngeneralizations and perspectives.\n\n\nJablonka says that the sense of information in all these situations\ninvolve a source, a receiver system (organism or organism-designed\nsystem), and a special type of reaction of the receiver to the\nsource. She conceives the receiver's reaction as a complex, regulated\nchain of events leading to a response.  Variations in the form of the\nsource lead to variations in response.  That is, the nature of the\nreaction depends on the way the source is organized. In addition, she\npoints out, reactions in these situations are beneficial for the\nreceiver over an appropriate period of time (in the case of organisms,\nover evolutionary time). Jablonka stresses that the benefit, or\nfunction, in the case of organisms should be understood in terms of\nevolution, with the focus on the evolution of the reaction\nsystem, not on the evolution of the source or the evolution of\nthe final outcome of the reaction.\n\n\nJablonka's concept of information is intentional, and is related to\nthe teleosemantic conceptions discussed above. According to standard\nteleosemantic conceptions, signals have information because the\nproduction of the signal was selected for in evolutionary history.\nAccording to Jablonka's view, however, an entity has information, not\nbecause it was selected for, but because the receiver's response to it\nwas selected for.  Whether something counts as information depends on\nwhether entities respond to it in a (proper) functional way.\n\n\nJablonka summarizes her general account in the following\ndefinition:\n\n\n\nA source \u2014 an entity or process \u2014 can be said to have\ninformation when a receiver system reacts to this source in a special\nway. The reaction of the receiver to the source has to be such that\nthe reaction can actually or potentially change the state of the\nreceiver in a (usually) functional manner. Moreover, there must be a\nconsistent relation between variations in the form of the source and\nthe corresponding changes in the receiver. (Jablonka 2002, p. 582)\n\n\n\nJablonka points out that according to this definition, genes do not\nhave a theoretically privileged status; they are one among many sources\nof information. In addition, she insists the focus should be on the\n\u201cinterpretive system of the receiver of the\ninformation\u201d, not on the source.\n\n\nJablonka argues that the information in DNA has little in common with\nthe information in an alarm call, a cloudy sky, or a chemical signal\nin a bacterial colony. In the latter cases, the receivers'\nreactions (or \u201cresponses\u201d) to the source are adaptive for\nthe receiver: \u201can alarm warns the bird there are predators\naround; the cloudy sky alerts the ape to the coming storm; the\nchemical alerts the bacteria to imminent starvation.\u201d\n(p. 585). But in the case of DNA, the receiver does not seem to react\nin a way that adapts the cell to anything in particular.\n\u201cRather, DNA is simply \u2018read\u2019 by the cell, so it is\nnot information in the same sense \u2026 DNA is information\n\u2018about\u2019 the cell or the organism, rather than\n\u2018for\u2019 the cell or the organism.\u201d (Jablonka 2002,\np. 585).  Nevertheless, Jablonka claims that her concept applies to\ngenes even if it doesn't apply to DNA in general:\n\n\n\nHowever, if instead of thinking about DNA in general we think about\na particular locus with a particular allele, it is not difficult to\nthink about the functional role of this particular allele in a\nparticular set of environmental circumstances. Hence we can say for\nall types of information, including alarm calls and pieces of\nDNA, a source S (allele, alarm call, cloudy sky, etc.) carries\ninformation about a state E for a receiver R (an\norganism or an organism-designed product), if the receiver has an\ninterpretation system that reacts to S in a way that usually\nends up adapting R (or its designer, if R is humanly\ndesigned) to E. (Jablonka 2002, p. 585, my stress)\n\n\n\nGiven that Jablonka says that DNA in general is not information in the\nsame sense as the alarm call and cloudy sky (and that this is the\nsense specified in the statement above), it is puzzling why she claims\nthat the statement quoted above applies to \u201call types of\ninformation.\u201d Furthermore, her claim that the statement above\napplies to particular alleles (and apparently not to DNA in general)\nis not straightforward. Jablonka's orignal account provides an\nilluminating way to think about information in biological processes\nsuch as cellular signaling processes. But her account does not\nsubstantiate the idea that genes and DNA contain information or help\nelucidate the role of genes and DNA.  \n",
