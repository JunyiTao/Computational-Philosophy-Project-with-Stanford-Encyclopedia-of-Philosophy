    "main_text": "God || God as Intellect\n3.2 God as Intellect\n\n\nFor Maimonides, God is a pure knower described in Aristotelian terms\nas purely actualized intellect and as the act of knowing that knows\nitself.\n\n\nAs we have already seen, following a Plotinian notion of divine\ntranscendence alongside an Aristotelian sense of God as a fully\nactualized Intellect, Maimonides and his Islamic predecessors and\ncontemporaries describe God as an absolutely pure and undivided unity,\nand as a perfected, fully actualized Intellect (in this latter way\nprima facie deviating from Plotinus\u2019 own sense of God as \u201cabove\nbeing\u201d and \u201cbeyond intellect\u201d). The notion of God as\nIntellect, rooted in Aristotle's own works, contrasts intellects which\nare less perfected with those which are more (or, in the case of God,\nfully) perfected in terms of lesser and greater degrees of actuality:\nwhile a lesser intellect is characterized at any given time by some\ndegree of not-yet-actualized-potentiality (which is to say, it doesn't\nyet know everything), the intellect of God alone\u2014being in a\nconstant and unchanging state of complete knowledge\u2014is described\nas being entirely devoid of unactualized potencies, residing always in\na state of pure actualization.\n\n\nWe can certainly see this Aristotelian emphasis on the \u201cGod as\nknower\u201d theme in al-Farabi, for whom God is \u201cthe first\ncause, the first intellect, and the first living\u201d (al-sabab\nal-awwal wal-\u2018aql al-awwal wal-\u1e25ayy al-awwal) (PS,\n81). As \u201cfirst cause\u201d God is the ontological foundation of\nall being; as \u201cfirst intellect\u201d He is the repository of\nall knowledge and final cause of all knowing; and as \u201cfirst\nliving\u201d He is the source of life itself. Emphasizing the idea of\nGod's unique ontological status, Al-Farabi elaborates:\n\nThe First Existent (al-mawj\u016bd al-awwal) is the First Cause\n(al-sabab al-awwal) of the existence of all the other\nexistences (PS 56). It is free of every kind of deficiency\u2026Thus\nits existence is the most excellent and precedes every other\nexistence\u2026It can in no way have existence potentially, and\nthere is no possibility whatever that it should not exist\u2026It is\nthe existent for whose existence there can be no cause\u2026 (PS 57)\n\nGod is uncaused and admits of no unactualized potency; he is pure\nact and necessary existent.\n\n\nAdding to this idea of God, and following further on an Aristotelian\ntheme of God as pure knowing that knows\nitself,[12]\nMaimonides adds:\n\nNow when it is demonstrated that God, may He be held precious and\nmagnified, is an intellect in actu (\u2018aql bil-fi\u2018l; Munk\n1931, 114, line 4) and that there is absolutely no potentiality in\nHim\u2014as is clear and shall be demonstrated\u2014so that He is\nnot by way of sometimes apprehending and sometimes not apprehending\nbut is always an intellect in actu, it follows necessarily that\nhe and the thing apprehended are one thing, which is His essence\n(dh\u0101t). Moreover, the act of apprehension owing to which\nHe is said to be an intellectually cognizing subject is in itself the\nintellect, which is His essence. Accordingly, He is always the\nintellect (al-\u2018aql) as well as the intellectually\ncognizing subject (al-\u2018\u0101qil) and the intellectually\ncognized object (al-ma\u2018aq\u016bl)\u2026 (G 1.68, P 165;\nArabic at Munk 1931, 114)\n\n\nIn Maimonides' idea of God's pure activity of intellection, we are\nreminded of Al-Farabi's own Aristotelian account. Not to be confused\nwith \u201cactive intellect\u201d (to which we will return below),\nGod (\u201cthe First\u201d) is described by Al-Farabi as an\n\u201cintellect in actu,\u201d or, an \u201cactual\nintellect\u201d (al-\u2018aql bil-fi\u2018l, literally, the\nintellect \u201cin act,\u201d or \u201cactualized\u201d) (PS\n70). Following on this idea, and mirrored most evidently in the quote\nfrom Maimonides above, Farabi follows Aristotle in describing God as\nthe thinking subject who thinks himself:\n\n\u2026for the One whose identity\n(ipseitas; h\u016bwiyya) is intellect is intelligible by\nthe One whose identity is intellect (PS 70). In order to be\nintelligible the First is in no need of another essence outside itself\nwhich would think it but it itself thinks its own essence. As a result\nof its thinking its own essence, it becomes actually thinking and\nintellect, and, as a result of its essence thinking (intelligizing)\nit, it becomes actually intelligized\u2026[It] is intellect and\nthinking by thinking its own essence\u2026[In the case of God, the\nFirst], the intellect (al-\u2018aql), the thinker\n(al-\u2018\u0101qil) and the intelligible (and intelligized)\n(al-ma\u2018q\u016bl) (PS 70) have\u2026one meaning and are\none essence and one indivisible substance (PS 71-3)\n\nIt is precisely this Aristotelian description of God (as subject\nand object of the pure act of knowing), together with a heightened\nNeoplatonic sensitivity to God's unity (arguably seen more\nemphatically in Avicenna than even in al-Farabi) which grounds\nMaimonides' own understanding of the divine.\n\n\nThis same identification of God as pure act can also be seen in\nAverroes who shares with his Neoplatonic Islamic philosophers and\nMaimonides a sense of God\u2019s purity of act, as can be seen in his\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, and the sense there of\nGod as:\n\nthe first mover [who] is eternal, substance, pure actuality and free\nfrom matter [CAM 1599, G 151].\n\n",
