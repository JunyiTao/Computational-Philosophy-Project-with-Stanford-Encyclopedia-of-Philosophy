    "main_text": "Beauty and Taste in Hume\u2019s Moral Theory || The Dispositional Analysis\n3.2 The Dispositional Analysis\n\nOur sentiments obey general principles governing our species. Yet we\nmust be able to make judgments of taste immediately, without having to\nbe aware of the laws governing them. \n\nHume\u2019s acknowledgment of regular, predictable causes of the\nmoral and aesthetic sentiment is sometimes taken as an indication that\nHume is not a genuine subjectivist. On this reading, he equates beauty\nand virtue with dispositional properties of external objects.\nAttributions of moral and aesthetic properties to objects indicate a\nspeaker\u2019s acknowledgment of the object\u2019s tendency to\nproduce the sentiment. There are passages that suggest such a reading:\n\u201cbeauty is such an order and constitution of parts, as \u2026\nis fitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul\u201d (T,\n299; see SOT, 273). The dispositional analysis of beauty is attributed\nto Hume by Savile (1982, p. 161), Mothersill (1984, pp.\n205\u2013206), and Levinson (2002). Reasons to think it is mistaken\nare provided by Baxter (1990). The dispositional analysis should not\nbe confused with the position that features of objects cause the\nrequisite sentiment. The case for attributing a causal theory of taste\nto Hume is provided by Shiner (1996)\n\nDespite such passages, it is questionable whether Hume really offers a\ndispositional analysis. A dispositional analysis tells us which\nproperties would exist if certain conditions were satisfied. A\nsimplified dispositional analysis treats \u201cCork is buoyant\u201d\nas equivalent in meaning to \u201cIf a piece of cork is placed in\nwater, it floats.\u201d A simplified dispositional analysis of beauty\ntreats \u201cThis object is beautiful\u201d as equivalent in meaning\nto \u201cIf anyone perceives this object under ideal conditions, a\nsentiment of approbation accompanies the perception.\u201d\u00a0 On\nthis account, beauty is distinct from the sentiment of approbation.\nThe sentiment is incorporated into the analysis, but the sentiment is\nnot itself a dispositional property.\n\nSuppose that Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property. Like the\ndispositional terms \u201cbuoyant\u201d and \u201cbrittle,\u201d\n\u201cbeauty\u201d could be predicated of objects, generating\njudgments that are true or false for different objects. Statements\nattributing dispositional properties to objects are true even if the\nappropriate conditions are never satisfied (e.g., \u201cThis vase is\nbrittle\u201d can be true despite the fact that the vase never gets\nbroken). Yet Hume clearly denies that judgments of taste are\ntruth-valued, and he denies that it makes sense to make inferences\nabout an object\u2019s beauty in advance of the requisite sentiment\n(S, 219).\n\nHume famously argues that, in order to clarify any idea, \u201cwe\nneed but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea\nderived\u201d (EHU, 22). If beauty is a dispositional property,\nthen one arrives at the idea of beauty by associating particular\ncauses with particular effects under specific conditions. In\nHume\u2019s terminology, a dispositional idea of beauty would be the\nidea of a complex relation of cause and effect. It would be a causal\nprinciple, and we could not employ the idea prior to formulating such\na principle. Yet, once again, Hume denies an implication of the\ndispositional analysis. The sentiment of approbation is our only\nsource for our idea of beauty, and there are cases where we recognize\nbeauty in advance of any reasoning about the beautiful object (EPM,\n173).\n\nFurthermore, if Hume regards beauty as a dispositional property, he\nhas a model close at hand in Hutcheson\u2019s analysis. But Hume\navoids offering any such account. Aside from a willingness to identify\nseveral ways that works of art must fail to please refined taste, Hume\ndoes very little to advance the traditional and familiar project of\ncriticism, the stipulation of rules for successful art. Granted, he\nendorses the existence of such rules (SOT, 269\u2013273) and\nprovisionally suggests (SOT, 273) that they serve as our standard of\ntaste, a point explored by Brown (1938), Jones (1976, 2009), Shelley\n(1994), and Costelloe (2007, pp. 3\u201317). However, he does not\nprovide an organized or dedicated presentation of the properties of\nobjects that regularly cause the sentiment of approbation. Costelloe\n(2018, pp. 161\u2013170) has nonetheless extracted three such\nprinciples from Hume\u2019s discussions of poetry. First, artistic\ndepictions must be grounded in what is familiar or, at the very least,\nplausible. Second, artworks must be constrained by coherence in their\nimaginative associations. Third, simplicity is preferable to\n\u201cexcessive ornamentation and artifice\u201d (Costelloe 2018,\n167). At the same time, Hume recognizes that any established\ncorrelation between sentiment and objective properties might be\ndefeated by the next example that we encounter (SOT, 270). Despite the\nexistence of \u201cgeneral principles of approbation or blame,\u201d\ntaste depends on too many variables (\u201cincidents and\nsituations\u201d) to offer a detailed dispositional analysis (SOT,\n271).\n\nPassages endorsing a dispositional account might be slips of the pen.\nOr, more likely, Hume does not believe that it is possible to define\nevaluative terms. They are indefinable, primitive terms. Hume\nemphasizes that \u201ccertain qualities in objects\u201d are the\noccasions for our sentiments of approbation and disapprobation (SOT,\n273). Formal design is one such quality (SOT 271; T, 299, 364). The\nexistence of occasioning qualities provides theoretical support for\nthe possibility of a convergence of refined taste. So our primitive\nevaluative terms are not arbitrarily applied. Nonetheless, it is\nirresponsible to endorse any particular thing or action in advance of\nthe verdict of unprejudiced taste.\n",
