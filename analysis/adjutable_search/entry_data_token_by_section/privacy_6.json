The target of this\nfeminist critique is classical liberalism, and it has been\ninfluential. Rawls\u2014the most influential liberal thinker of the\ntwentieth century\u2014accepted at least part of this criticism as\njustified, and he revised his own theory as a result (Rawls 2001:\n166).\n\nHowever, in classical liberal theory there is a double interpretation\nof the private domestic realm. On the one hand, the private domain is\nvalued positively as the domestic sphere that is sheltered; on the\nother hand, the private sphere is the sphere of women and therefore\ninferior to the public sphere, according to the coding of a\npatriarchal society. As a result, the domestic sphere (including the\nfamily) is valued and prized as the realm that is sheltered from the\ndemands of a hostile world. However, it is associated with\n\u201cwomen\u201d, while the public sphere is associated with\n\u201cmen\u201d. The private is thus characterized as inferior to\nthe public, just as nature is considered inferior in relation to\nculture (Okin 1991).\n\nIn the history of privacy, we are confronted with yet another double\nreading: even though liberal theory since Hobbes and Locke has\nadvocated equal liberties for all citizens, it has clung to a natural\nconception of privacy that patently contradicts the notion of equal\nrights. This is because it grants those rights to men only, and not to\nwomen (Locke 1690; Hobbes 1651). As feminist theory has argued, this\nseems to have little to do with nature and more to do with power and\nculture. Seen in purely normative terms, nature provides us with no\nargument as to why certain activities (or persons) should be\nconsidered \u201cprivate\u201d, and others \u201cpublic\u201d\n(Pateman 1989; Phillips 1991; Jean Cohen 1992; Fraser 1992; Ortner\n1974 [1998]). The classical liberal moral (and later also legal) right\nto privacy and private freedom has to be separated from the natural\ninterpretation, which is still looms large in the background of\neveryday culture.\n\nIt is necessary to examine the feminist critique from yet another\nangle. In principle, early radical egalitarian feminist approaches are\nskeptical with respect to any possible conceptualization of\nprivacy. The best-known of these skeptical approaches is the one\ndeveloped by MacKinnon (1987, 1989, 1991; see also Olsen 1991). For\nMacKinnon, the appeal to legal or moral rights to privacy is but a\nfurther manifestation of the attempt to push women back into an\nideologically constituted realm of privacy defined as the\nnon-political or pre-political, and only ever concede them rights\ninsofar as they are seen as different or deviant. Privacy can be\ndangerous for women when it is used to cover up repression and\nphysical harm inflicted on them, perpetuating the subjection of women\nin the domestic sphere and encouraging non-intervention by the state.\nSuch a concept of privacy, according to MacKinnon, fails to call the\nsexual hierarchy into question. Instead, it simply preserves the\nsocial power structures that find expression in the correlation of\nwomen with the private, and men with the public.\n\nIn response to MacKinnon\u2019s argument, one objection is that it\nfails to make a clear enough distinction between a natural,\npre-political concept of privacy on the one hand (which is rejected\nnot only by MacKinnon herself, but also by other theories of privacy)\nand a legal-conventional concept of privacy on the other (Allen 1988;\nJean Cohen 1992). A more reasonable view, according to Anita Allen\n(1988), is to recognize that while privacy can be used as a shield for\nabuse, it is unacceptable to reject privacy completely based on harm\ndone in private (see also DeCew 1997: 86). A complete rejection of\nprivacy would result in everything being made public, leaving the\ndomestic sphere open to complete scrutiny and intrusion by the state.\nAllen and other theorists (such as Pateman 1989: 118\u2013136; see\nespecially Jean Cohen 1992) suggest that societies in general, as well\nas traditional conceptual divisions between the private and the\npublic, can be criticized and revised (or, as Cohen [1992] puts it,\n\u201credescribed\u201d). Therefore, feminists should adopt a\nconcept of privacy that is not in the gender-specific,\nnatural tradition, but is instead oriented towards the notion of\nfreedom (see Allen 1988). The challenge is to find a way for the state\nto take seriously the domestic abuse that used to be allowed in the\nname of privacy, while also preventing the state from imposing itself\nonto the most intimate parts of women\u2019s lives. This means\ndrawing new boundaries for justified state intervention, and thus\nunderstanding the public/private distinction in new ways (see\n \u00a73\n and\n \u00a74\n below).\n\nAnother feminist perspective on privacy is related to the critique of\nliberalism in a different way. The approaches to privacy that are\nlinked to freedom and autonomy have been criticized from the\nperspective of a theory of power (Brown 1995; Cornell 1995).\nSkepticism towards such approaches arises because they follow from,\nand are consonant with, other (liberal) dichotomies (such as\nsubject-object or having rights or no rights) that are thought to be\nessentially exclusionary and discriminatory. It is further argued that\nsuch conceptions fail to take into account and criticize the power\nstructures inherent in society, which are therefore also inherent in\nthe structures protecting privacy.\n\nFeminist approaches are far from homogeneous. They range from examples\nthat appear to reject any conceptualization of privacy whatsoever\n(e.g., Brown 1995; see also the different but equally critical\nperspective on liberal conceptualizations in Geuss 2001), to those\nthat propose alternative ways of determining privacy, as is the case\nwith Morris, who discussing Pitkin (1981) argues that\n\n\nprivacy should be reconstructed rather than abandoned, for otherwise\nit is impossible to think critically about central problems in\ndemocratic theory\u2014among them the very possibility of\ncitizens\u2019 representing, or translating into a common language,\nwhat is most singular, secret, ineffable, internal, that is, private,\nabout themselves. (2000: 323)\n\n\nShe defends a \u201cpositive political theory of privacy\u201d which\nshe understands as being part of a democratic theory (2000: 323).\n",
