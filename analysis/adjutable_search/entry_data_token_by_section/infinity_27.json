Among the\nancients, Zeno is renowned for his paradoxes of space, time and\nmotion. They involve infinitely many spatial or temporal subdivisions\nor processes that are putatively impossible\u2014see the entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes.\n Among the moderns, Kant is particularly notable for his treatment of\nthe extent of space and time in his \u2018First Antinomy of Pure\nReason\u2019. We turn to it now.\n8.1.1 Kant\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, A426\u2013A434,\nB454\u2013B462\u2014Kant gives \u2018proofs\u2019 of conflicting\ntheses\u2014\u2018thesis\u2019 and\n\u2018antithesis\u2019\u2014about the extent of space and time. The\n\u2018thesis\u2019 says that:\n\nthe world has a beginning in time; and\nthe world has a finite extension.\n\n\nThe \u2018antithesis\u2019 says:\n\nthe world has no beginning in time; and\nthe world has infinite extension.\n\n\nTo a reasonable approximation, the \u2018proofs\u2019 run as\nfollows:\n\nIf the world has no beginning in time, then, up to any given\nmoment, an eternity has elapsed: there has passed away an infinite\nseries of successive states of things. But the infinity of a series\nconsists in the fact that it can never be completed through successive\nsynthesis. So it is impossible for an infinite series of successive\nstates of things to have passed away: the world has a beginning in\ntime.\nSince infinite extension cannot be thought in a single completed\nact of thought, the world can only be thought to have infinite\nextension through an act of synthesis in which completion is achieved\nvia the addition of units. But an act of synthesis that achieved\ncompletion via the addition of units requires the lapse of an infinite\namount of time\u2014and we have already seen, in (a), that this is\nimpossible. Consequently, it cannot be thought that the world has\ninfinite extension. So the world does not have infinite\nextension.\nSomething begins to exist only if there is a prior time at which\nit does not exist. Hence, if the world has a beginning in time, there\nmust be an earlier time at which it does not exist: an empty time. But\nnothing can come into existence in an empty time, since there is no\nsufficient reason for the thing to come into existence in one rather\nthan another part of empty time. So the world does not have a\nbeginning in time.\nIf the world has finite extension, then the world is contained in\nan unlimited empty space. Consequently, the objects in the world are\nnot only related in space but also related to space.\nIn particular, the relation of the world to empty space is a relation\nof the world to no object, i.e. to nothing. But there can be no such\nrelation. So the world has infinite extension.\n\n\nMuch in Kant\u2019s discussion of the antinomies of space and time is\nmarred by his conflation of the modern definition of infinity as lack\nof finitude with the Aristotelian conception of the impossibility of\ncompletion. In addition, at A487/B515 we have confirmation that Kant\nuses \u201cinfinite\u201d and \u201cunbounded\u201d, as well as\n\u201cfinite\u201d and \u201cbounded\u201d, synonymously:\n\u201cFor if it [the magnitude of the world in space] is infinite and\nunbounded, then it is too big for every possible empirical concept. If\nit is finite and bounded, then you can rightfully ask: What determines\nthis boundary?\u201d It was only with the work of Bernhard Riemann in\nthe nineteenth century that geometrical concepts of space were\nintroduced that allowed the decoupling of unboundedness and infinity\n(and correspondingly of bounded and finite). See section\n 8.2.\n\nYou can find further\u2014sometimes sympathetic\u2014discussion of\nthese arguments in Bennett (1966), Huby (1971), Whitrow (1978), Craig\n(1979), Moore (1990/2019), Oppy (2006), Huemer (2016), and the entry\non\n Kant\u2019s Critique of Metaphysics.\n8.1.2 Measure\n\nHere is a Zeno-style argument:\n\nSuppose for reductio that a finite line segment of non-zero\nlength is composed of infinitely many disjoint parts of equal,\nreal-valued length.\n\nEither the parts all have zero length or they all have the same\nnon-zero length.\nThe length of the whole line segment is the sum of the lengths of\nthe parts.\nIf the parts all have zero length, then the line segment has zero\nlength, contradicting our assumption that it has non-zero length.\nIf the parts all have non-zero length, then the line segment has\ninfinite length contradicting our assumption that it is finite.\n\n\nConclusion 1: A finite line segment cannot be composed of infinitely\nmany disjoint parts of equal real-valued length.\n\nTherefore,\n\nConclusion 2: It cannot be composed of points.\n\nPremise 1 is beyond reproach. However, premises 2, 3, and 4 require us\nto be careful about how lengths add. Recall that in section\n 3.2\n we discussed how to add a countable sequence of numbers \u2013 but\nthe method described there depends on the order, and requires a\ncountable, well-ordered sequence. Although there are techniques for\nsumming uncountable sets of non-negative numbers, most mathematicians\ndeny that lengths or other measures can be added in these ways. This\nis parallel to what Kolmogorov said about probability (see section\n 6.3).\n Probability and length are two paradigms of the more general\nmathematical field of \u201cmeasure theory\u201d, which includes all\nsuch countably additive real-valued functions. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of this problem, including approaches involving\ninfinitesimal length, see Skyrms (1983).\n\nFor more about measure theory, see Bartle (1995) and Tao (2011).\n8.2. Non-Euclidean geometries, relativistic space-time, and cosmic topology\n8.2.1 Non-Euclidean geometries\n\nIn section\n 1\n we anticipated that Archytas\u2019 argument for the infinitude of\nthe cosmos, and Kant\u2019s treatment of the antinomies, conflated\nthe notions of finiteness and boundedness.\n\nWe now need to introduce another aspect of 19th century mathematics\nthat brought that crucial distinction into focus. The distinction\nbetween finiteness and boundedness (and consequently that between\ninfinitude and unboundedness) greatly improved our understanding of\nissues concerning the structure of space, and what shape a finite, or\nan infinite space, might take. Recall that for two centuries after\nNewton, cosmology was developed within the framework of Euclidean\ninfinite space. Such a space is infinite in all directions, it is\nhomogeneous and isotropic\u2014that is, it is the same at all\nlocations and in all directions.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, alternative conceptions of\ngeometrical space were developed, so-called non-Euclidean\ngeometries. Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevski and Riemann, showed that\none can develop geometries that falsify Euclid\u2019s parallel axiom\nwhile preserving all the other Euclidean axioms. The axiom states (in\na later but equivalent version to the one given by Euclid) that for\nany line and a point external to that line, there is one and only one\nparallel to the given line passing through the point. The statement\ncontains a claim of existence and a claim of uniqueness. It can be\nthus falsified by denying existence or by accepting the existence but\ndenying the uniqueness. Both alternatives have been developed, with\nsome of the earliest interpretations using surfaces. The first\nalternative, where no parallels exist to any given line that pass\nthrough a given point external to the given line, is known as\nelliptic geometry. An instance of elliptic geometry is\nspherical geometry, so called because it can be modeled on\nthe surface of a sphere. The second alternative is known as\nhyperbolic geometry and in it for every line in the model and\nany point outside of the line there are infinitely many parallels to\nthat line passing through the point. A portion of the surface of a\nhorse saddle can be used to model hyperbolic geometry. (The pictures\nbelow are based on those in Luminet 2008: 49.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe curvature of a surface at a point \\(p\\) on the surface measures\nhow much the surface bends away from its tangent plane at \\(p\\). The\ncurvature of a surface is constant if at every point \\(p\\) of the\nsurface the surface bends away from the tangent plane by the same\nquantity. Examples of surfaces which can be used to model various\ngeometries are the surface of the cylinder (Euclidean; constant\ncurvature 0), the sphere (spherical; positive curvature), and the\nhorse saddle (hyperbolic; negative curvature). They are all homogenous\nand isotropic but they have different constant curvature.\n\nSuch geometries on surfaces spurred the development of\nthree-dimensional and higher dimensional spaces with different\ncurvatures: positive, null, and negative. An example of a space of\npositive constant curvature is the 3-sphere (also called\nhypersphere) used by Bernhard Riemann in his 1854 dissertation (see\nRiemann 1868; for an English translation see Riemann 2016). A\n3-sphere is a surface in a four-dimensional space that is\nobtained as a generalization of the 2-sphere as visualized in\nthree dimensions: in both cases we define the relevant notion as a\nlocus of points that have a constant distance from a point (its\ncenter). For instance, the unit 2-sphere centered at the origin is the\nset of triples of real numbers \\((x, y, z)\\) that are one unit away\nfrom (0, 0, 0), i.e. that satisfy \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2 =1\\), and the\n3-sphere with distance 1 from the origin (0, 0, 0, 0) is the set of\nquadruples \\((x, y, z, w)\\) of real numbers satisfying \\(x^2 +y^2 +z^2\n+w^2 =1\\). It is a model of physical space that is finite but\nunbounded, in explicit opposition to Newton\u2019s conception of\nspace.\n\nArchytas\u2019s argument (in section\n 1\n above), which conflated unboundedness with infinitude, could finally\nbe put to rest. Riemann\u2019s model allows for the universe to be\nfinite and unbounded at the same time. In 1854 he wrote: \u201cThe\nunboundedness of space possesses in this way a greater empirical\ncertainty than any external experience. But its infinite extent by no\nmeans follows from this; on the other hand if we assume independence\nof bodies from position, and therefore ascribe to space constant\ncurvature, it must necessarily be finite provided this curvature has\never so small a positive value. If we prolong all the geodesics\nstarting in a given surface-element, we should obtain an unbounded\nsurface of constant curvature, i.e., a surface which in a flat\nmanifoldness of three dimensions would take the form of a sphere, and\nconsequently be finite.\u201d (Riemann 2016: 39)\n\nThe distinction between infinite and unbounded is an integral part of\nthe conceptual leap that leads to the idea that physical space need\nnot be Euclidean. In the following section we will briefly describe\nhow issues of curvature and topology play a role in addressing the\nquestion of whether the world is spatially finite or infinite in\ncosmology.\n\nOn non-Euclidean geometries the reader will find useful Greenberg\n(2007) and Gray (2010). On the philosophical relevance of curvature\nand Riemannian geometry see the classic Torretti (1984).\n8.2.2 Relativistic space-time and cosmic topology\n\nIn 1915 Einstein introduced general relativity, and our conception of\nthe universe is based on it. General relativity rests on a conception\nof space and time\u2014or better, space-time matter\u2014that stands\nin opposition to the Newtonian one we have described above. In\nEinstein\u2019s theory, space-time is deformable and its shape\ndepends on the presence of matter. Space-time is, in technical terms,\na four-dimensional manifold. We may think of an \\(n\\)-dimensional\nmanifold as a set of \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers. The spatial section\nof a four-dimensional manifold of space-time is a three-dimensional\nmanifold (one can think of it as a set of triples of real numbers),\nand when cosmologists ask about the shape of the universe they try to\ncharacterize this three-dimensional manifold. The curvature of\nspace-time corresponds to gravitation, and light rays and other\nmaterial particles follow the geodesics (shortest paths) in the\nmanifold. In general, the geodesics differ depending on the\nmatter-energy content of the space being considered. The geodesics of\nthe surface of the sphere (i.e. a two-dimensional surface) are\nportions of great circles. In the Euclidean plane, they are segments\nof straight lines. There are analogous notions for four-dimensional\nmanifolds. Einstein\u2019s equations for general relativity describe\nhow the matter-energy content of the universe determines the geometry\nof space-time. The equations also yield cosmological models, which\nmust be tested by empirical observation. The equations allow for\nmultiple solutions and, as Alexander Friedmann (1924) observed,\n\u201cin the absence of additional hypotheses, Einstein\u2019s\nequations for the universe do not allow to definitely answer the\nquestion of the finiteness of the universe\u201d. Let us briefly\nexplain what is at stake in this comment, by pointing out the role of\ncurvature and topology with respect to the issue of finiteness vs.\ninfiniteness of our universe in relativistic cosmology. Topology is\nthe branch of geometry that classifies spaces according to whether\nthey can be transformed into one another \u201ccontinuously\u201d,\nthat is with transformations that do not lead to cuts or tears.\n\nIn 1917, Einstein posited a static finite universe. The finiteness was\ngiven by the choice of the 3-sphere (see section\n 8.2.1)\n and the static nature of the universe by the fact that the radius of\nthe hypersphere did not change with time. With Friedmann\n(1922\u201324) and Lema\u00eetre (1927), Einstein\u2019s static\nmodel would be replaced by dynamical models (to account for the\nempirical evidence that by 1930 led to the postulation that the\nuniverse is expanding, i.e., most galaxies, galaxy clusters, etc. are\ngrowing further apart, just as spots on an uninflated balloon grow\nfurther apart when the balloon is blown up). Such models are also\namong the possible solutions for Einstein\u2019s equations and they\nwere the source for the so-called \u201cBig Bang\u201d theories. But\nwhat about finiteness? The finiteness or infiniteness of the universe\nare not determined by Einstein\u2019s equations, which allow for both\npossibilities. In his choice of the 3-sphere, Einstein was motivated\nby considerations that had to do with preserving a hypothesis by Mach\non inertial mass and inertial motion. Friedmann and Lema\u00eetre\nalso opted for the finiteness of the universe (we need not get into\nwhy they did so). Their dynamical models assumed a uniform\ndistribution of matter in the universe and that space is homogeneous\nand isotropic. But the Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre dynamical solutions\nstill allow for a great variety of mathematical solutions and do not\nsettle the issue of finiteness. Our observations in what follows are\nrestricted to such models.\n\nSpace, in this context, is characterized by its curvature (taken to be\nconstant) and its topology. Let us consider curvature first. In these\nmodels, there are three possible types of spaces depending on whether\nthe curvature of the space is negative, null, or positive. The spaces\ncorresponding to such curvatures are called hyperbolic,\nEuclidean, and elliptical. A spherical space\n(constant positive curvature) is always of finite extension, no matter\nwhat its topology is. This explains, at least in part, why many early\ncosmologists (including Einstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lema\u00eetre\nand others) opted for this solution. Indeed, for a long time issues\nconcerning the topology of space were not brought to the fore due to\nthe implicit assumption that the topology of space was a simply\nconnected topology (in a simply connected topology every loop on the\nsurface can be continuously contracted to a point). Under that\nassumption, spaces of positive constant curvature are finite and those\nof null and negative constant curvature are infinite. The issue then\nof the finiteness vs. infiniteness of the universe rests on the mean\ndensity of matter and energy and on the value of a parameter\n\\(\\lambda\\) introduced by Einstein in 1917, called the\ncosmological constant (measuring a sort of anti-gravitational\nforce). With most cosmologists (but not Einstein in 1917) assuming\n\\(\\lambda = 0\\), and with the assumption that space is simply\nconnected, determining curvature (and hence resolving the finiteness\nvs infinity issue) depends only on a critical value for the mean\ndensity of matter\u2014equivalently, on a density parameter\n\\(\\Omega\\). Thus, under those assumptions, it would be in principle\npossible to determine the curvature of space experimentally.\n\nDifferent values of \\(\\lambda\\) lead to different scenarios for the\nevolution of the universe. With \\(\\lambda = 0\\), if the curvature of\nspace is negative or null we end up with a constantly expanding\nuniverse; if the curvature of space is positive, a phase of expansion\nwould be followed by a contraction leading to a \u201cbig\ncrunch\u201d. Other values of the cosmological constant are possible\nand if \\(\\lambda \\lt 0\\) a \u201cbig crunch\u201d will occur no\nmatter what the curvature of space is. By contrast, if \\(\\lambda \\gt\n0\\), no \u201cbig crunch\u201d will occur. New experimental evidence\n(coming from type 1A supernovae and fossil radiation) seems to\nindicate a positive mean density of matter and a value of \\(\\lambda\n\\gt 0\\). In this case the universe would be finite while still\nremaining in perpetual accelerated expansion.\n\nMoreover, recent work has pointed out the importance of considering\nmultiply connected topologies. Unlike what happens for simply\nconnected topologies, curvature does not immediately determine the\nfiniteness or infinity of the space. Indeed, there are spaces of null\nor negative curvature that can be finite or infinite depending on the\nmultiply connected topology associated to them. This leads into\ncosmic topology, which investigates the global shape of space\nand how it can be determined experimentally. If space has positive\ncurvature, then the universe is finite independently of the specific\ntopology associated with it. But if the curvature is negative or null,\nwhether the universe is finite or not will depend on the topology.\nThus, determining whether the universe is finite or infinite requires\nnot only determining the mean density of matter (which determines the\ncurvature of space) but also the topology of space. Two major\ntechniques that are employed experimentally to determine the topology\nof space are cosmic crystallography and the circles in the sky method\n(based on the cosmic microwave background).\n\nFor further information on cosmic topology see Luminet, Starkmann, and\nWeeks, (1999), Luminet and Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey (2005), Luminet (2005)\n(English 2008). See also Aguirre (2011) and Luminet (2015). For more\ntechnical treatment see Thurston (1997), Weeks (2001), and Hitchmann\n2018.\n9. Conclusion\n\nWe are well aware that our discussion of infinity is\nincomplete\u2014but then, so is any such discussion. We take some\ncomfort from the fact that it is impossible to give balanced coverage\nto a boundless set of issues in finite space.\n\nThere are many more philosophically significant paradoxes and puzzles\nthat involve infinity in one way or another; we have only given a\nsmall sample. And new paradoxes involving infinity seem to appear at\nan ever-increasing rate (doubtless yet another one can be fashioned\nout of this very fact!). However, so too are our tools for\nunderstanding infinity. Of course, we cannot give a definitive\nassessment of the state of play, but the theoretical developments that\nwe have sketched and references that we have cited make us sanguine\nthat overall, the prospects for our relationship with infinity are\ngood: we can indeed live with it.",
