    "main_text": "Defending Others || Self-Defense vs. Other-Defense\n6.1 Self-Defense vs. Other-Defense\nWhat is the relationship between the morality of self-defense and the morality of defending others? One natural view is that the two share the same underlying rationale, such that the permissibility of other-defense goes \u201chand-in-hand\u201d with the permissibility of self-defense (Thomson 1991: 306). This seems most plausible in the case of liable attackers. Since the justification for harming such person\u2019s rests on the \u201centirely impersonal\u201d fact that they have forfeited their ordinary right against harm, it seems plausible that that any suitably situated person may act on that justification (Thomson 1991: 308).\nHowever, as explained in \u00a72, some writers deny that all justifications for defensive harm are impersonal (or \u201cagent-neutral\u201d) in this way. Proponents of agent-relative permissions hold that some justifications apply only to defense of oneself (or of others to whom one is specially related). If this view is correct, then the permissibility of self and other-defense will often come apart. For example, it may be permissible for an individual to kill an innocent person in order to defend her own life (and perhaps also permissible for her loved ones to kill to save her), but impermissible for third-parties to do so (on whether agent-relative justifications can be transferred, see Bazargan-Forward 2018; Lazar 2015.\n",
