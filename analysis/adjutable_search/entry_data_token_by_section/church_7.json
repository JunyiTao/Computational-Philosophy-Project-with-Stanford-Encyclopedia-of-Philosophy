    "main_text": "Philosophy of Logic || Adopting a Formalized Language\n2.2 Adopting a Formalized Language\n\nCentral to the logistic method is the process of adopting a formalized\nlanguage. This process takes place in an informal meta-language (such\nas a fragment of English) that\n\n\ndeals with matters of everyday human experience, going beyond such\nmatters only in that no finite upper limit is imposed on the number of\nobjects that may be involved in any particular case, or on the time\nthat may be required for their manipulation according to instructions.\n(1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nIncluded in Church\u2019s description of the process of adopting a\nformalized language is that one first specifies the primitive symbols\nand formation rules, which together with the axioms and inference\nrules constitute the primitive basis of the logistic system\n(which will become a language once semantical rules are added). The\ndescription of this process assumes that the person who undergoes it\nhas a stock of information about language and the world, the ability\nto understand definitions (such as the definition of \u201cprimitive\nsymbol\u201d) as well as the ability to understand and follow\ninstructions. Church also provided a rational reconstruction of how we\nlearn our first language and suggested that this method could, in\nprinciple, be used to learn a formalized language rather than a\nnatural language as a first language:\n\n\nSome part of the language must first be learned approximately by the\nmethod of example and imitation; then this imprecisely known part of\nthe language is applied in order to state rules of the language (and\nperhaps to correct initial misconceptions); then the known part of the\nlanguage may be extended by further learning by example and imitation,\nand so on in alternate steps, until some precision in knowledge of the\nlanguage is reached. There is no reason in principle why a first\nlanguage, learned in this way, should not be one of the formalized\nlanguages of this book, instead of one of the natural languages.\n(1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nThis assumes that the person who undergoes this process can not only\nstate rules but also apply them, so it assumes that such a person can\nreason as well as imitate behavior. In this way, it resembles,\nsomewhat, Church\u2019s earlier philosophy of logic in which he\ndistinguished between intuitive logic and formal\nlogic and maintained that intuitive logic cannot be learned and is a\nprecondition of reasoning in formal logic. (Church\u2019s early\nphilosophy of logic is described in\n supplement B.)\n One reason for the absence of the locution \u201cintuitive\nlogic\u201d from Church\u2019s mature philosophy might be that he\nwanted to avoid the impression that there is some essential difference\nbetween what should take place in an informal meta-language and what\nshould take place in a formalized object language. In fact, he was\nadamant that basic deductive reasoning should not have to\ntake place in an informal meta-language. Rather, once the object\nlanguage has been set up it\n\n\nshall be an independent language capable, without continued support\nand supplementation from the meta-language, of expressing those things\nfor which it was designed. (1956a: fn. 121)\n\n\nThe idea is that a person who can already reason as well as use an\ninformal meta-language to set up the object language can come to\nreason with greater rigor and to a greater extent in the object\nlanguage. At which point, having pulled herself up by her bootstraps,\nshe should no longer have any need for an informal meta-language. (Of\ncourse, a meta-language is still needed to prove certain meta-theorems\nabout the object language such as its consistency.)\n",
