Navya-Ny\u0101ya lists seven\n\u2018categories\u2019 of object: substance (dravya),\nquality (gu\u1e47a), motion or action (karma),\nuniversal (s\u0101m\u0101nya), particularity or\ndifferentiator (vi\u015be\u1e63a), inherence\n(samav\u0101ya), and absence (abh\u0101va). Of\nthese, the first six comprise the classical list of categories, found\neven in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra, while the\nseventh (absence) is a distinctive addition by the later school. Most\nof these types are themselves subject to sub-division: thus, there are\nnine types of substance, twenty four types of quality, etc.\n\nOne main question concerning this list of categories is whether we can\ndiscern any underlying structure or organising principle. This is\nrelated with another important question: just what is a category?\nThe Manual of Reason answers this second question by giving\nthe etymological analysis of the term\n\u2018pad\u0101rtha\u2019 (category):\n\u2018pad\u0101rtha\u2019 is the artha or meaning\nof a pada or word. The claim is that the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\ncategories are in some way the metaphysical correlates of linguistic\nstructures. One way to make this claim more precise would be to note\nthe existence of striking similarities between the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika system and Sanskrit grammar (cf. esp. Faddegon\n1918). Another way is to observe a distinctive pattern of argument\nemployed, in which the hypothesis that a certain type of substance,\nquality, etc. exists is supported on the ground that it explains some\nfeature of our linguistic practice (for example, the argument that\nspace exists as it explains our use of directional terms.)\n\nAn alternative approach would be to seek some purely apriori\nrationale behind the list. Athalye (1930: 75) offers one such:\n\nA notion is either positive or negative, and so the external object of\na notion might be \u2018existent\u2019 (bh\u0101va) or\n\u2018non-existent\u2019 (abh\u0101va).\n\u2018Existent\u2019 things again are of two kinds, properties and a\ncommon substratum in which they reside. The latter is\n\u2018substance\u2019 (dravya). Of the properties, again,\nsome reside in many objects conjointly, others in individual things\nsingly. The first is \u2018universal\u2019\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya), while the latter class is again\ndivisible into properties that are stationary and those that are\nevanescent, i.e. \u2018quality\u2019 (gu\u1e47a) and\n\u2018motion\u2019 (karma). The remaining two categories,\n\u2018inherence\u2019 (samav\u0101ya) and\n\u2018particularity\u2019 (vi\u015be\u1e63a) are assumed\nto explain the special theories of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas.\n\n\nThis reconstruction of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system is not quite\nsatisfactory, for it relies on an unexplained and perhaps\nquestion-begging distinction between stationary and evanescent\nproperties, and leaves two of the categories completely unaccounted\nfor. Another reconstruction (also deficient) is offered by Potter\n(1977). When we look at The Manual of Reason\u2019s own\ndefinitions of the individual categories, it seems to be following\nthis approach. The Manual of Reason\u2019s definitions are\nas follows:\n\nSubstance\n\n(i)\n that which possesses the universal substance-hood;\n(ii)\nthat which possesses qualities (TSD 3)\n\nQuality\n\n(i)\nthat which possesses universals, and isn\u2019t a substance\nor motion;\n(ii)\nthat which possesses the universal quality-hood (TSD 4)\n\n\nMotion\n\n(i)\nthat which causes conjunctions (between substances);\n(ii)\nthat which possesses the universal motion-hood (TSD 5)\n\n\nUniversal\nthat which is eternal, unitary, and inherent in many things (TS\n82)\nDifferentium\nthat which exists in eternal substances and functions as their\ndifferentiator (TS 83)\nInherence\nthat thing which is eternal and a relation (TS 84)\nAbsence\n[No general definition given]\n\n\nThere are certain problems with this series of definitions, read as an\napriori reconstruction of the categories. In particular, the\ndefinitions of \u2018substance\u2019 and \u2018quality\u2019 seem\nto be jointly circular, unless we take as already given universals\nsuch as substance-hood, which make the definitions somewhat vacuous. I\nwill give another reconstruction, one which roughly follows the great\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika author Udayana (cf. Tachikawa\n1981).\n",
