Objectivity as Absence of Normative Commitments and the Value-Free Ideal\n\nIn the previous section we have presented arguments against the view\nof objectivity as faithfulness to facts and an impersonal \u201cview\nfrom nowhere\u201d. An alternative view is that science is objective\nto the extent that it is value-free. Why would we identify\nobjectivity with value-freedom or regard the latter as a prerequisite\nfor the former? Part of the answer is empiricism. If science is in the\nbusiness of producing empirical knowledge, and if differences about\nvalue judgments cannot be settled by empirical means, values should\nhave no place in science. In the following we will try to make this\nintuition more precise.\n",
