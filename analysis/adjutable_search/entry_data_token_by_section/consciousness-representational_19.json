    "main_text": "What It\u2019s Like\n5. What It\u2019s Like\n\nSome philosophers (e.g., Dretske (1995), Tye (1995)) use this\ntroublesome expression simply to mean a sensory quality, and this is\none of the two meanings it has had in recent philosophy of mind. But\nin the fourth paragraph of this entry, the phrase was introduced in\nthe context, \u201c\u2018what it\u2019s like\u2019 for the subject\nto be in a particular mental state, especially what it is like for\nthat subject to experience a particular qualitative property,\u201d\nwhich indicates that there is another sense (4) in which (when the\nmental state does involve a sensory quality) the \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like\u201d is something over and above the quality itself.\nIn fact, since this second \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d is\nitself a property of the quality, it cannot very well be identical\nwith the quality. It is the property of what it is like to\nexperience that quality; alternately, the relevant introspectible\nproperty of the experience itself. Let us now just speak of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d (WIL) properties, meaning just this\nhigher-order phenomenal sort.\n",
