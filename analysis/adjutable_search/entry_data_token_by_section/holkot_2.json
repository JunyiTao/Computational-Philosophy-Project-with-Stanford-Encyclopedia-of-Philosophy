    "main_text": "Relation to Ockham || Differences with Ockham on epistemology\n2.2 Differences with Ockham on epistemology\n\nHolkot did differ with Ockham in the details of his epistemology.\nHolkot, like Ockham, adopted the terms \u201cintuitive\u201d and\n\u201cabstractive\u201d cognition to designate the basic forms of\nhuman understanding. But Holkot\u2019s treatment of intuitive\ncognition differed from Ockham\u2019s on the question of the\npossibility of intuitive cognition of non-existents. For Ockham,\nintuitive cognition was the direct intellectual cognition of the\npresence and existence of an object. Holkot used Ockham\u2019s own\nstyle of analysis to develop his critique. He noted that\n\u201cintuitive cognition\u201d was a connotative term, connoting\nboth a kind of quality, which is cognition, and the cognized object as\nit exists and is present in itself. The term stands for the\nco-presence of cognition with its object. This led Holkot to argue\nagainst Ockham\u2019s contention that God\u2019s omnipotent power to\ncause directly whatever is ordinarily caused through secondary causes\nwould enable God to conserve the intuitive cognition of an object even\nafter the object has been destroyed. Holkot objected that given the\nmeaning of the term \u201cintuitive cognition,\u201d if God were to\nconserve cognition of an object after destroying it, that cognition by\ndefinition could no longer be an intuitive cognition. It would be an\nabstractive cognition, the kind of cognition present in the absence of\nan object.\n\nHolkot also differed with Ockham about the nature of abstractive\ncognition. He argued in favor of retaining species as part of natural\nand cognitive processes. In De stellis he refers to the sun\npropagating the natural species of light through the medium of the\nair. He did not consider the species operative in cognition to be such\nnatural species, however. The term \u2018species\u2019 when used to\nrefer to the whiteness in one external object and to the whiteness in\nanother could be called univocal, having the same meaning in each\ncase, but the term \u2018species\u2019 used to refer to the\nwhiteness in an object as a quality and to the whiteness representing\nthe object in the intellect was equivocal. The intellectual species is\nonly a likeness of the thing in the sense of representing it (like a\nstatue of Hercules in relation to Hercules), and we experience it in\nourselves as it enables us to think about an external object in the\nabsence of that object. Holkot was not much concerned whether such\n\u201cspiritual qualities\u201d were called \u201cspecies,\u201d\n\u201cidols,\u201d \u201cimages,\u201d or \u201cexemplars\u201d\nas long as they were understood to serve as representatives of things\nor even \u201cknowledge habits\u201d and not as the natural\nqualities that exist in extramental reality. Holkot\u2019s opponent\nwas not Ockham, here, however, but his Dominican contemporary William\nCrathorn, who had argued for the view that natural and cognitive\nspecies were the same in kind. Holkot ridiculed Crathorn\u2019s\nposition at length in the Sex articuli, on the grounds that\nif Crathorn were right, our minds would become white or black, hot or\ncold, depending on what we were thinking about. Crathorn was arguing\nin line with a long tradition stretching back to Roger Bacon.\nHolkot\u2019s sharp disjunction between natural and spiritual\n\u201clikenesses,\u201d natural and spiritual qualities, went beyond\nthe traditional distinction between sensible and intelligible species\nand seems to show the effects of the Ockhamist critique, even while he\nretained remnants of the Aristotelian vocabulary.\n",
