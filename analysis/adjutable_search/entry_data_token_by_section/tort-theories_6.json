    "main_text": "Contemporary Philosophical Approaches to Tort Law || Civil Recourse\n4.4 Civil Recourse\n\nOver the past two decades, a new account of tort liability has emerged\nwith the rise of \u201cCivil Recourse Theory\u201d. Initially\nintroduced by Benjamin Zipursky (2003), and then developed further in\njointly authored work by John Goldberg and Zipursky (2020), as well as\nby others, civil recourse theory accepts the corrective justice\naccount of wrongdoing, but rejects its account of remedies. Civil\nrecourse writers also accept the corrective justice critique of\neconomic and other instrumental theories, arguing that tort law must\nbe understood as in the first instance as law concerned with\nwrongdoing, rather than as law governing safety incentives or as an\naccount of a privatized form of regulation. Instead, a tort is a civil\nwrong, a wrong that one person commits against another. Civil recourse\ntheory shares with corrective justice theory the idea that the wrongs\naddressed by tort law are relational, that is, it shares the view that\nthe plaintiff and defendant must be connected in the right way at\nevery stage of the analysis of wrongdoing. Civil recourse accounts\ntherefore reject instrumentalist accounts of wrongdoing, including\nwhat Goldberg and Zipursky characterize as \u201cdual\ninstrumentalism\u201d, the idea that the point of tort liability is\nto advance both deterrence and compensation. Civil recourse theory\nalso reject the economic analysis of tort law that focuses exclusively\non providing incentives to potential defendants, pointing to the\none-sidedness problem to which corrective justice writers also draw\nattention.\n\nCivil recourse writers have also emphasized the plurality of torts,\narguing that tort law provides a unified system, because it brings\ntogether the full range of relational wrongs, including not only\nnegligence of the sort that has occupied so much legal scholarship\nover the past century, but also defamation, battery, intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress and many other wrongs. Civil recourse\ntheory emphasizes these wrongs, not because they are the main business\nof modern legal systems, but because a focus on their relational\nstructure clarifies the ways in which torts are relational wrongs. An\nexcessive focus on negligence makes non-relational accounts, whether\nfocused on deterrence or compensation, appear at least superficially\nviable. If, however, tort law really is a unified doctrinal area, then\nfocus on other torts clarifies that the basic form of tortious\nwrongdoing can only be understood relationally. The tort of fraud\nprovides a particularly clear illustration: it requires that the\ndefendant intentionally represented the subject matter of the deceit\nto the deceived plaintiff. If someone purchases a forged artwork based\non a lie that the seller told to someone else, the purchaser has no\naction in fraud against the seller. So, too, in defamation, only the\nperson who was defamed has a cause of action, even if that\nperson\u2019s family members or business associates will suffer as\nmuch or more from the defamation.\n\nThe fundamental disagreement between civil recourse writers and\ncorrective justice writers turns on the remedial aspect of tort law.\nAs a common-law subject, tort law develops largely (though not\nexclusively) through the litigation of concrete disputes; in the\ncontext of those disputes, the plaintiff is always seeking a remedy\nfrom the defendant. For corrective justice writers, the point of the\nremedy is to address the wrong; the relation between the defendant and\nthe plaintiff that makes the defendant\u2019s act towards the\nplaintiff wrongful is also the basis for the remedy. For civil\nrecourse theorists, by contrast, the aim of a tort remedy is not to\nrepair the wrong, but rather to empower plaintiffs to confront and\nmake a demand on the persons who wronged them. The difference is\nsubtle but important: although damages addressed to repairing the\nwrong provide one form of recourse, the idea of recourse is more\ngeneral. Although remedies are occasioned by wrongdoing, their purpose\nis not simply to repair wrongs. Drawing on John Locke\u2019s idea of\nthe social contract, Goldberg and Zipursky suggest that, having\nprohibited self-help remedies, the state owes an obligation to persons\nwho have been wronged to provide them with a civil avenue of recourse\nthrough which they can proceed against those who have wronged them; a\ntort remedy is something that the plaintiff is empowered to seek from\nthe defendant rather than something that the plaintiff is entitled to\nreceive from the defendant. Until the plaintiff initiates an action\nand prevails in it, the defendant is not under a duty to pay damages\n(Smith 2012; 2019). Rather than contending that a remedy repairs a\nwrong, civil recourse writers read the eighteenth-century Latin maxim\nubi jus, ibi remedium\u2014where there is a right there must\nbe a legal remedy for its violation\u2014as providing those who have\nbeen wronged with the opportunity to do something to those who have\nwronged them. Civil recourse writers point to advantages of\nunderstanding the nature of tort remedies in this way, notably in\ncases in which tort remedies are insufficient to repair wrongs.\nMonetary damages may allow the plaintiff to purchase a replacement for\nproperty that has been damaged or destroyed, but in many other cases\nthey will not allow the plaintiff to continue life as if the wrong had\nnot occurred. No amount of money can make up for the loss of a limb,\nor a child, or for the humiliation of a breach of privacy or the\nwillful infliction of emotional distress (Hershovitz 2017). Civil\nrecourse writers focus on such cases in order to argue that the point\nof damages is to enable the person who has been wronged to exact an\nappropriate remedy from the wrongdoer, even when that remedy would be\ninadequate by any compensatory measure. Even in the case of injuries\nthat can be readily repaired, or of lost earnings that can be made up\nwith their estimated monetary equivalent, civil recourse writers\ncontend that the purpose of the remedy is better explained in terms of\nthe recourse that it provides rather than the loss that it\ncompensates. They argue that this provides a more unified account of\ntort law, rather than the one that is limited to a narrow class of\ninterferences with agency and remedies that seek to restore agency\n(Sage 2021).\n",
