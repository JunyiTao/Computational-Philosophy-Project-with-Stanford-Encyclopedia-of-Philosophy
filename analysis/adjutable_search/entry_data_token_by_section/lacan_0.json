    "main_text": "Historical Overview\n1. Historical Overview\n\nMedically trained as a psychiatrist, Lacan\u2019s first texts started\nappearing in the late 1920s (during the course of his psychiatric\nstudies), with his publishing activity really taking off in the\nsubsequent decade. The 1930s see several early Lacanian milestones:\nthe publication, in 1932, of his doctoral thesis in psychiatry, De\nla psychose parano\u00efaque dans ses rapports avec la\npersonnalit\u00e9 (On Paranoid Psychosis in its Relations with\nthe Personality); collaborations with the Surrealist and Dadaist\nartistic movements in whose midsts he circulated as a familiar fellow\ntraveler; entry into analytic training, including a didactic analysis\nwith Rudolph Lowenstein; attendance at Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s\nrenowned seminars on G.W.F. Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of\nSpirit; the first presentation of the now-famous theory of the\n\u201cmirror stage\u201d at the International Psychoanalytic\nAssociation (IPA) conference at Marienbad in 1936 (a presentation\ntruncated by Freud\u2019s friend and biographer, then-IPA President\nErnest Jones); and, the appearance, in the Encyclop\u00e9die\nfran\u00e7aise in 1938, of a substantial essay on a sizable\nswathe of analytic topics entitled Les complexes familiaux dans la\nformation de l\u2019individu: Essai d\u2019analyse d\u2019une\nfonction en psychologie (\u201cThe Family Complexes in the\nFormation of the Individual: Attempt at an Analysis of a Function in\nPsychology\u201d). This crucial period of Lacan\u2019s development,\nas the immediately preceding already indicates, was marked by the\ncollision of interests and influences related to psychoanalysis,\npsychiatry, philosophy, art, and literature, among other areas. More\nspecifically, the robustly interdisciplinary combination that came\ntogether for Lacan at this time of Freudian analysis, Hegelian\ndialectics, Koj\u00e8vian pedagogy, and different experiences of\n\u201cmadness\u201d from numerous perspectives indelibly colors and\npermanently inflects the entire rest of Lacan\u2019s intellectual\nitinerary.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Second World War was, for Lacan (and, of course,\nfor history generally), a period of disruption and upheaval. His\npsychoanalytic activities were interrupted, including his training\nanalysis (Lowenstein and Lacan did not concur about whether this\nanalysis was well and truly completed, with Lacan deciding it was over\nand, somewhat controversially, never returning to Lowenstein\u2019s\ncouch). The War provided Lacan with an exposure to military psychiatry\nin both France and England, with his five-week visit to the latter\nacquainting him with aspects of the British psychoanalytic world\n(features of this visit are recounted in \u201cBritish Psychiatry and\nthe War\u201d [1947]). A handful of important texts were composed\nduring and after the War, all of which eventually got reprinted in\nLacan\u2019s magnum opus, \u00c9crits (1966):\n\u201cLogical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty: A New\nSophism\u201d (1945); \u201cPresentation on Psychical\nCausality\u201d (1946); \u201cAggressiveness in\nPsychoanalysis\u201d (1948); and \u201cThe Mirror Stage as Formative\nof the I Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic\nExperience\u201d (delivered in 1949 at the IPA conference in\nZurich\u2014whereas the 1936 version from Marienbad is lost, this\nversion is the surviving one made canonical through its inclusion in\n\u00c9crits).\n\nThe next decade was pivotal in Lacan\u2019s trajectory, the time when\nhe fully came into his own as a leading analytic thinker of great\noriginality and immense import. A veritable explosion of Lacanian\nmaterial was unleashed during this period, including seven annual\nseminars and many of the most celebrated essays subsequently collected\nin the nine-hundred-page \u00c9crits (a number of these\nwere hyper-condensed distillations of the results of the annual\nseminars). At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, Lacan\nbecame initiated into and conversant with the structuralism of\nFerdinand de Saussure and his inheritors such as Claude\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss and Roman Jakobson. L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s\n1949 book The Elementary Structures of Kinship helped launch\nthe French structuralist movement that flourished during the 1950s and\n1960s, an orientation that challenged the theoretical primacy of\nexistentialism in France. L\u00e9vi-Strauss\n\u201cstructuralized\u201d anthropology, as Roland Barthes did for\nliterary-cultural studies and Louis Althusser for Marxism. Up through\nthe end of the 1950s\u2014in 1959\u20131960, a fundamental\nreorienting shift arguably occurred in Lacan\u2019s\nthinking\u2014Lacan fairly can be portrayed as likewise\nstructuralizing Freudian psychoanalysis. He did so under the banner of\na \u201creturn to Freud\u201d according to which, as his most famous\ndictum has it, \u201cthe unconscious is structured like a\nlanguage\u201d (l\u2019inconscient est structur\u00e9 comme un\nlangage). Lacan portrayed himself as the lone defender of a\nFreudian orthodoxy in danger of being eclipsed by its alleged\nabandonment and betrayal in the post-Freudian analytic universe,\nparticularly Anglo-American ego psychology as consolidated by the\ntroika of Heinz Hartmann, Ernst Kris, and Lacan\u2019s former analyst\nLowenstein. Lacan adamantly maintained that a Saussurian-assisted\nrecovery of the overriding significance of language for analysis both\nclinical and metapsychological is the key to faithfully carrying\nforward Freud\u2019s revolutionary approach to psychical\nsubjectivity. All of this was announced in detail in the lengthy\nfounding manifesto of Lacanianism, the 1953 \u00e9crit\n\u201cThe Function and Field of Speech and Language in\nPsychoanalysis\u201d (often referred to as the \u201cRome\nDiscourse\u201d because of where it was delivered). This manifesto\ncoincided with Lacan\u2019s participation in an exodus from his\nformer analytic institute, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Parisienne de\nPsychanalyse (SPP), and the founding of a new institute, the\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Psychanalyse (SFP). The\nSPP\u2019s move to a medicalized model of analytic training (as per\nthe scientistic psychiatric paradigm that was dominant in the\ninstitutes of the English-speaking world) was one of the main\nprecipitators of the departure of the breakaway faction that founded\nthe SFP.\n\nAlso in 1953, Lacan conducted his first annual seminar addressing\nFreud\u2019s Papers on Technique (1953\u20131954). Lacan\ncontinued giving these right up until shortly before his death, with\nle S\u00e9minaire running continuously for twenty-seven\nyears. As was the case with Koj\u00e8ve, Lacan exerted his influence\nprimarily through his oral teachings. The first decade of le\nS\u00e9minaire (1953\u20131963) was taught at the\nH\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne and had an audience consisting mostly of\npsychoanalysts. For reasons I will explain shortly, Lacan, in 1964,\nmoved his seminar first to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure\n(1964\u20131969) and then to the Faculty of Law across from the\nPanth\u00e9on (1969\u20131980). From 1964 onwards, Lacan\u2019s\naudience startlingly increased in both sheer numbers and breadth of\nbackgrounds, with artists and academics from various disciplines\nacross academia joining the more clinically-minded attendees. Le\nS\u00e9minaire became a nodal Parisian intellectual\ninstitution, a kind of hub attracting some of the brightest stars of\nthe post-War French cultural firmament. For instance, such\nphilosophers as Jean Hyppolite, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Luce\nIrigaray, and Julia Kristeva spent time in Lacan\u2019s audience. In\nhis seminars, Lacan deftly maneuvered within and between a multitude\nof theoretical currents, putting psychoanalysis into conversation with\nthe history of philosophy, phenomenology, existentialism,\nstructuralism, post-structuralism, feminism, and, as already\nindicated, just about every discipline represented in the university.\nAll of the major French philosophers of the generation that came of\nage in the 1960s and 1970s engaged with Freudian analysis in one way\nor another, and all of them did so in fashions varyingly informed by\nLacan\u2019s teachings.\n\nThe 1960s were a highly productive and equally tumultuous era in\nLacan\u2019s history. In his seventh seminar on The Ethics of\nPsychoanalysis (1959\u20131960), Lacan took a sort of turn\nfateful for the direction of his later trajectory, initiating an\ninterrogation of the ways in which language was privileged by his\n1950s \u201creturn to Freud.\u201d The immediately prior years\ntirelessly emphasized the essential role of the register of the\nSymbolic, namely, the pride of place of analytically modified versions\nof Saussurian signifiers in the structures and dynamics of the\nunconscious and speaking subjectivity (in the 1930s and 1940s, the\nphenomenal-visual register of the Imaginary was to the fore thanks to\nthe focus on the mirror stage). At the end of the 1950s, with the rise\nof the Real as the register of a new focus of Lacan\u2019s\nthinking\u2014I will say more about Lacan\u2019s tripartite register\ntheory subsequently (see\n 2.1\n below)\u2014things and phenomena escaping, resisting, or thwarting\nthe signifying powers of the socio-linguistic symbolic order became\never more central in Lacanian theory. These things and phenomena\ninclude Otherness, drives, jouissance, and objet petit\na, among other Lacanian concepts (see\n 2.3,\n 2.4.2, and\n 2.4.3\n below). This 1959\u20131960 seminar defensibly can be depicted as a\nprescient post-structuralist text avant la lettre.\n\nAn earthquake in Lacan\u2019s professional and personal histories hit\nhim in 1963. For ten years (1953\u20131963), the SFP, following its\ncreation after the defections from the SPP, was being scrutinized at\nlength by the IPA as a training institute applying for IPA membership.\nTo cut a long story short, the IPA ended up offering the SFP an\nultimatum: It could be admitted only if Lacan was struck from its list\nof training analysts. Lacan\u2019s non-standard\n\u201cvariable-length sessions,\u201d deviating from the\nfixed-length session rules of IPA orthodoxy, was the main reason for\nthe IPA\u2019s withholding of its recognition from him. The SFP\naccepted this condition, stripping Lacan of his standing within it. In\nthe aftermath of what he understandably experienced as a deeply\nwounding betrayal, he abandoned his original plans for a\n1963\u20131964 seminar on The Names-of-the-Father (only its\nopening session of November 20, 1963 was given), relocated his\nteaching from the H\u00f4pital Sainte-Anne to the \u00c9cole\nNormale Sup\u00e9rieure, and conducted his deservedly renowned\neleventh seminar of 1964, The Four Fundamental Concepts of\nPsychoanalysis (with Lacan identifying these four concepts as the\nunconscious, repetition, the transference, and the drive). This\nseminar\u2019s opening session involved Lacan discussing his\nSFP-brokered \u201cexcommunication\u201d from the IPA, with him\ncomparing himself to Baruch Spinoza and the latter\u2019s expulsion\nfrom the Jewish community for being a heretic. However traumatic this\nblow, it seemed to prompt Lacan to come even more into his own, to\nforge a distinctly Lacanian battery of ideas and terms\u2014and this\nby contrast with the more familiar Freudian language and apparatus of\nthe first decade of le S\u00e9minaire (1953\u20131963).\nAlthough not without many precedents in his prior work, a Lacanianism\ndistinct from Freudianism began to emerge clearly into view in the\nmid-1960s. In the shadow of his rejection by the IPA and departure\nfrom the SFP, Lacan founded his own analytic organization, the\n\u00c9cole freudienne de Paris. This new institutional framework\n(and freedom) provided him with a setting in which to experiment with\nnovel approaches to analytic teaching and training.\n\nIn 1966, Lacan\u2019s hulking tome \u00c9crits was\npublished by \u00c9ditions du Seuil. Prior to this, Lacan had\npublished only a single book, his thesis in psychiatry (1932). The\nnine-hundred-page \u00c9crits gathered together many of\nLacan\u2019s most important articles and essays into a single volume,\ncovering a thirty-year stretch from 1936 to 1966. These\n\u201cwritings\u201d provide very daunting and demanding paths of\nentry into Lacanian thinking (the annual seminars are comparatively\nmore reader-friendly and transparent). Although the\n\u00c9crits bear no small portion of responsibility for\nLacan\u2019s reputation as a \u201cdifficult\u201d (if not\ndeliberately obscurantist) thinker, this book became a bestseller upon\nits initial release in France. Its success elevated Lacan into his\nfame as the French Freud in the eyes of France\u2019s reading public.\nDuring this time, Lacan\u2019s audience for le\nS\u00e9minaire continued to swell, with his influence growing\nto cover ever-wider circles of Paris-centered intellectual and\ncultural life.\n\nThroughout his career, Lacan exhibited a serious interest in various\nbranches of mathematical and formal disciplines. This goes as far back\nas the 1940s, with the recourse to game theory in \u201cLogical Time\nand the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty.\u201d The turn to\nstructuralism at the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s\nreinforced these formalistic tendencies, with Lacan, in the 1950s,\nalready drawing upon not only game theory, L\u00e9vi-Straussian\nanthropology, and Jakobsonian phonology, but also the history of\nmathematics and topology. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, more and\nmore diagrams, graphs, and symbolizations appeared peppered throughout\nLacan\u2019s lectures and writings, testifying to a steadily\nintensifying trend toward formalization. By the late 1960s and,\nespecially, the 1970s, discussions of logic, topology, and knot theory\nwere prominent (sometimes even dominant) features of Lacanian\ndiscourse. In relation to Lacan, the 1970s could be characterized as\nthe decade of the \u201cmatheme,\u201d Lacan\u2019s neologism for a\nunit of formalization (qua a mathematical-style\nsymbolization) distilling and fixing the core significance of a\nspecific Lacanian analytic concept-term. Lacan hoped thereby to avoid\nbeing misinterpreted in the ways that Freud\u2019s deceptively\naccessible employments of natural language allegedly allowed most\nnon-Lacanian post-Freudians to perpetrate. Additionally, topology, as\na science of surfaces, provided Lacan with resources for his regular\nassaults on the crude, popular images of psychoanalysis as a\n\u201cdepth psychology,\u201d with these images relying upon the\nsimplistic two- and three-dimensional Euclidean spaces of spontaneous\npicture thinking. Topological figures and constructions undermining\nthe intuitions of this picture thinking assisted Lacan in recasting\nthe unconscious as an ensemble of contortions, curvings, folding,\ninflections, twists, and turns immanent and internal to a single plane\nof minded subjectivity accessible to rigorous, rational\n(psycho)analysis.\n\nIn addition to the pursuit of formalization via mathemes, the seminars\nof the final decade of Lacan\u2019s teachings also were preoccupied\nwith reflections on his register theory, especially the register of\nthe Real, and sexual difference (reflections often intertwined with\neach other). The program of formalization ostensibly enabled Lacan to\nreveal with exactitude the precise limits of the sayable and the\nrepresentable, thereby touching upon the Real through showing what is\nnot pinned down fully and adequately within the coordinates of the\naccessible, familiar \u201creality\u201d co-constituted through the\nother two registers of the Imaginary and the Symbolic (see\n 2.1\n below). Various aspects and facets of things sexual came to be\nassociated by the later Lacan with the enigmatic evasiveness of the\nReal, including sexual difference. In one of his most famous seminars,\nthe twentieth (Encore, 1972\u20131973), he theorized sexual\ndifference as \u201csexuation,\u201d depicting the non-biological,\ndenaturalized subject-positions of masculinity and femininity in terms\nof formal logic. Therein, he purported to uncover an inherent,\nineliminable structural discrepancy/gap separating the sexes, an\ninescapable condemnation of sexed subjects to being essentially,\nnecessarily out-of-sync with each other (and even with themselves as\nsplit subjects). Lacan summarized this with an infamous one-liner:\n\u201cIl n\u2019y a pas de rapport sexuel\u201d (There is\nno sexual relationship). This declaration scandalized many at the\ntime. Moreover, the twentieth seminar in particular as well as\nconnected portions of Lacan\u2019s corpus from this same period\nserved as powerful catalysts for crucial developments in French\nfeminist thinking during the 1970s.\n\nIn 1980, near the end of his life, Lacan saw fit to disband his\nschool, the \u00c9cole freudienne. This decision was controversial\nand triggered factional infighting amongst his followers. Lacan died\nin 1981. His son-in-law and editor of le S\u00e9minaire,\nJacques-Alain Miller\u2014when he was a student of Althusser\u2019s\nat the ENS, Miller met Lacan for the first time in 1964 as an attendee\nof Lacan\u2019s eleventh seminar\u2014founded the \u00c9cole de la\nCause freudienne as a successor to the \u00c9cole freudienne on the\nheels of the latter\u2019s \u201cdissolution.\u201d Miller has\nsince retained publishing control over Lacan\u2019s texts, editing\nthe Champ freudien book series in which official\n\u201cestablished\u201d versions of the annual seminars and other\nLacanian writings appear.\n\n",
