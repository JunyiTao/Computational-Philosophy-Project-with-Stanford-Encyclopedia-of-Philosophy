    "main_text": "Life || From Stalinist Revolutionary to Methodologist of Science\n1.3 From Stalinist Revolutionary to Methodologist of Science\n\nImre Lakatos was born Imre Lipsitz in Debrecen, eastern Hungary, on\nNovember 9, 1922, the only child of Jewish parents, Jacob Marton\nLipsitz and Margit Herczfeld. Lakatos\u2019s parents parted when he\nwas very young and he was largely brought up by his grandmother and\nhis mother who worked as a beautician. The Hungary into which Lakatos\nwas born was a kingdom without a king ruled by an admiral without a\nnavy, the \u201cRegent\u201d Admiral Horthy, who had gained his\nnaval rank in the service of the then-defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nThe regime was authoritarian, a sort of fascism-lite. After a\nbrilliant school career, during which he won mathematics competitions\nand a multitude of prizes, Lakatos entered Debrecen University in\n1940. Lakatos graduated in Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy in\n1944. During his time at Debrecen he became a committed communist,\nattending illegal underground communist meetings and, in 1943,\nstarting his own illegal study group.\n\n\nNo-one who attended Imre\u2019s groups has forgotten the intensity\nand brilliance of the atmosphere. \u201cHe opened the world to\nme!\u201d a participant said. Even those who were later disillusioned\nwith communism or ashamed of acts they committed, remember the sense\nof inspiration, clear thinking and hope for a new society they felt in\nImre\u2019s secret seminars. (Long 2002: 265)\n\n\nHowever, in Lakatos\u2019s group the emphasis was on preparing the\nyoung cadres for the coming communist revolution, rather than engaging\nin public propaganda or antifascist resistance activities (Bandy 2009:\nch. 3).\n\nIn March 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary to forestall its attempts to\nnegotiate a separate peace. (The Hungarian government had allied with\nthe Axis powers, in the hopes of recovering some of the territories\nlost at the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. By 1944 they had begun to\nrealize that this was a mistake.) Admiral Horthy, whose anti-Semitism\nwas a more gentlemanly affair than that of the Nazis (he was fine with\nsystematic discrimination but apparently drew the line at\nmass-murder), was forced to accept a collaborationist government led\nby D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay as prime minister. The new regime had none\nof Horthy\u2019s humanitarian scruples and began a policy of\nenthusiastic and systematic cooperation with the Nazi genocide\nprogram. In May, Lakatos\u2019s mother, grandmother and other\nrelatives were forced into the Debrecen ghetto, thence to die in\nAuschwitz\u2014the fate of about 600,000 Hungarian Jews.\nLakatos\u2019s father, a wine merchant, managed to get away and\nsurvived the war, eventually ending up in Australia. A little earlier,\nin March, Lakatos himself had managed to escape from Debrecen to\nNagyv\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) with false papers under the\nname of Moln\u00e1r. Later, a Hungarian friend, Vilma Bal\u00e1zs,\nrecalled that\n\n\nImre [had been] very close to his mother and they were quite poor. He\noften blamed himself for her death and wondered if he could have saved\nher (Bandy 2009: 32).\n\n\nIn Nagyv\u00e1rad Lakatos restarted his Marxist group. The co-leader\nwas his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, \u00c9va\nR\u00e9v\u00e9sz. In May, the group was joined by \u00c9va\nIzs\u00e1k, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist who needed\nlodgings with a non-Jewish family. Lakatos decided that there was a\nrisk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, hence her\nduty, both to the group and to the cause, was to commit suicide. A\nmember of the group took her across country to Debrecen and gave her\ncyanide (Congden 1997, Long 2002, Bandy 2009, ch. 5). To lovers of\nRussian literature, the episode recalls Dostoevsky\u2019s The\nPossessed/Demons (based in part on the real-life Nechaev affair).\nIn Dostoevsky\u2019s novel the anti-Tsarist revolutionary, Pyotr\nVerkhovensky, posing as the representative of a large revolutionary\norganization, tries to solidify the provincial cell of which he is the\nchief by getting the rest of group to share in the murder of a\ndissident member who supposedly poses a threat to the group. (It does\nnot work for the fictional Pytor Verkhovensky and it did work for the\nreal-life Sergei Nechaev.) Hence the title of Congden\u2019s 1997\nexpos\u00e9: \u201cPossessed: Imre Lakatos\u2019s Road to\n1956\u201d. But to communists or former communists of Lakatos\u2019s\ngeneration, it recalled a different book: Chocolate, by the\nBolshevik writer Aleksandr Tarasov-Rodianov. This is a stirring tale\nof revolutionary self-sacrifice in which the hero is the chief of the\nlocal Cheka (the forerunner of the KGB). Popular in Hungary, it\nencouraged a romantic cult of revolutionary ruthlessness and sacrifice\nin its (mostly) youthful readers. As one of Lakatos\u2019s\ncontemporaries, Gy\u00f6rgy Magosh put it,\n\n\nHow that book inspired us. How we longed to be professional\nrevolutionaries who could be hanged several times a day in the\ninterest of the working class and of the great Soviet Union (Bandy\n2009: 31).\n\n\nIt was in that spirit, that the ardent young Marxist, \u00c9va\nIzs\u00e1k, could be persuaded that it was her duty to kill herself\nfor the sake of the cause. As for Lakatos himself, a chance remark in\nhis most famous paper suggests something about his attitude.\n\n\nOne has to appreciate the dare-devil attitude of our methodological\nfalsificationist [or perhaps as he would have said in an earlier phase\nof his career, the conscientious Leninist]. He feels himself to be a\nhero who, faced with two catastrophic alternatives, dares to reflect\ncoolly on their relative merits and [to] choose the lesser evil.\n(FMSRP: 28)\n\n\nIf you admire the hero who has the courage to make the tough choice\nbetween two catastrophic alternatives, isn\u2019t there a temptation\nto manufacture catastrophic alternatives so that you can heroically\nchoose between them?\n\nLate in 1944, following a Soviet victory, Lakatos returned to\nDebrecen, and changed his name from the Germanic Jewish\nLipsitz to the Hungarian proletarian Lakatos\n(meaning \u201clocksmith\u201d). He became active in the now legal\nCommunist Party and in two leftist youth and student organizations,\nthe Hungarian Democratic Youth Federation (MADISZ) and the Debrecen\nUniversity Circle (DEK). As one of the leaders of the DEK, Lakatos\nagitated for the dismissal of reactionary professors from Debrecen and\nthe exclusion of reactionary students.\n\n\nWe are aware that this move on our part is incompatible with the\ntraditional and often voiced \u201cautonomy\u201d of the university\n[Lakatos stated], but respect for autonomy, in our view, cannot mean\nthat we have to tolerate the strengthening of fascism and reaction\n(Bandy 2009: 59 and 61).\n\n\nLakatos moved to Budapest in 1946. He became a graduate student at\nBudapest University, but spent much of his time working towards the\ncommunist takeover of Hungary. This was a slow-motion affair,\ncharacterized by the infamous \u201csalami tactics\u201d of the\nCommunist leader M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi. Lakatos worked\nchiefly in the Ministry of Education, evaluating the credentials of\nuniversity teachers and making lists of those who should be dismissed\nas untrustworthy once the communists had taken over (Bandy 2009: ch.\n8). He was also a student at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s College, but attacked it\npublicly as an elitist and bourgeois institution. The College, and\nothers like it, was closed in 1950 after the communist takeover. In\n1947 Lakatos gained his doctorate from Debrecen University for a\nthesis entitled \u201cOn the Sociology of Concept Formation in the\nNatural Sciences\u201d. In 1948, after the communist takeover was\nsubstantially complete, he gained a scholarship to undertake further\nstudy in Moscow.\n\nLakatos flew to Moscow in January 1949, only to be recalled for\n\u201cun-Party-like\u201d behaviour in July. What these\n\u201cun-party-like\u201d activities were is something of a mystery\nbut even more of a mystery is why, having returned from Moscow under a\ncloud, he seemed so cool, calm and collected. Lakatos\u2019s\nbiographers, Long and Bandy, speculate that he was being held in\nreserve to prepare a case against the communist education chief,\nJ\u00f3zsef R\u00e9vai, who was scheduled to appear in a new show\ntrial. But when R\u00e1kosi decided not to prosecute R\u00e9vai\nafter all, Lakatos was thrown to the wolves (Bandy 2009: ch. 12; Long\n2002). He was arrested in April 1950 on charges of revisionism and,\nafter a period in the cellars of the secret police (including, of\ncourse, torture), he was condemned to the prison camp at Recsk.\n\nHowever Lakatos was probably doomed anyway. In later life Lakatos was\nbig admirer of Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Perhaps\nhe recognized himself in Orwell\u2019s description of the Party\nintellectual (and expert on Newspeak) Syme:\n\n\nUnquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He\nthought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that\nSyme\u2026was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal\nif he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong\nwith Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness,\na sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox.\nHe believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he\nrejoiced over victories, he hated heretics\u2026. Yet a faint air of\ndisreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have\nbeen better unsaid, he had read too many books\u2026. (Orwell 2008\n[1949]: 58)\n\n\nAn instance of Lakatos\u2019s Syme-like behaviour is his 1947\ndenunciation of the literary critic and philosopher Gy\u00f6rgy\nLuk\u00e1cs, one of the intellectual luminaries of the communist\nmovement. Luk\u00e1cs represented the academically respectable face\nof communism, and favoured a gradual and democratic transition to the\ndictatorship of the proletariat. Lakatos organized an\n\u201canti-Luk\u00e1cs meeting\u2026held under the aegis of the\nVal\u00f3s\u00e1g Circle\u201d to critique Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s\nfoot-dragging and \u201cWeimarism\u201d (Bandy 2009: 110). Once the\nregime was firmly in control, Luk\u00e1cs was indeed censured for\nhis undue concessions to bourgeois democracy, and he spent the early\nfifties under a cloud. But in 1947, Lakatos\u2019s criticisms were\ndeemed premature and he got into trouble because of his un-Party-like\nactivities. (Luk\u00e1cs himself referred to the episode as a\n\u201ccliquish kaffe klatsch\u201d.) In Communist Hungary\nit was important not to be \u201cone pamphlet behind\u201d the Party\nline (Bandy 2009: 92). Lakatos was the sort of over-zealous communist\nwho was sometimes a couple of pamphlets ahead.\n\nAfter his release from Recsk in September 1953 (minus several teeth),\nLakatos remained for a while, a loyal Stalinist. He eked out a living\nin the Mathematics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Science,\nreading, researching and translating (including a translation into\nHungarian of George P\u00f3lya\u2019s How to Solve It).\nDuring this time he was informing on friends and colleagues to the\n\u00c1VH, the Hungarian secret police, though he subsequently\nclaimed that he did not pass on anything incriminating (Long, 2002:\n290 ). It was whilst working at the Mathematics Institute that he\nfirst gained access to the works of Popper. Gradually he turned\nagainst the Stalinist Marxism that had been his creed. He married (as\nhis second wife) \u00c9va Pap and lived at her parents\u2019 house\n(his father-in-law being the distinguished agronomist, Endre Pap). In\n1956 he joined the revisionist Pet\u0151fi Circle and delivered a\nstirring speech on \u201cOn Rearing Scholars\u201d which at least\nburnt his bridges with Stalinism:\n\n\nThe very foundation of scholarly education is to foster in students\nand postgrads a respect for facts, for the necessity of thinking\nprecisely, and to demand proof. Stalinism, however, branded this as\nbourgeois objectivism. Under the banner of partinost\n[Party-like] science and scholarship, we saw a vast experiment to\ncreate a science without facts, without proofs.\n\n\u2026 a basic aspect of the rearing of scholars must be an\nendeavour to promote independent thought, individual judgment, and to\ndevelop conscience and a sense of justice. Recent years have seen an\nentire ideological campaign against independent thinking and against\nbelieving one\u2019s own senses. This was the struggle against\nempiricism [Laughter and applause] (Bandy 2009: 221. Bandy quotes the\ntranscripts which seem to differ slightly from the prepared text in\nthe Lakatos archives, reprinted in F&AM)\n\n\nBut Lakatos was not just explicitly repudiating Stalinism. He was also\nimplicitly criticizing another prominent member of the Pet\u0151fi\nCircle who had been a big influence on his first PhD, namely\nGy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs. (See Ropolyi 2002 for the early influence.)\nFor Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s work is pervaded by just the kind of\nhostility towards empiricism and disdain for facts that Lakatos is\ndenouncing in his speech, as well as an arts-sider\u2019s contempt\nfor the natural sciences, all of which would have been anathema to the\nlater Lakatos. Indeed Luk\u00e1cs was notorious for the view that\nthat\n\n\neven if the development of science had proved all Marx\u2019s\nassertions to be false\u2026we could accept this scientific\ncriticism without demur and still remain Marxists\u2014as long as we\nadhered to the Marxist method\n\n\nand that\n\n\nthe orthodox Marxist who realizes that\u2026the time has come for\nthe expropriation of the exploiters, will respond to the\nvulgar-Marxist litany of \u201cfacts\u201d which contradict this\nprocess with the words of Fichte, one of the greatest of classical\nGerman philosophers: \u201cSo much the worse for the facts\u201d.\n(Luk\u00e1cs 2014 [1919]: ch. 3.)\n\n\nThus the Stalinist Lakatos of 1947 had explicitly denounced\nLuk\u00e1cs for not being Stalinist enough, but the revisionist\nLakatos of 1956 was implicitly denouncing Luk\u00e1cs for being\nmethodologically too much of a Stalinist. For the later Lakatos, what\nwas wrong with \u201corthodox Marxism\u201d was chiefly that its\nnovel factual predictions had been systematically falsified (see\n \u00a73.2\n below). But that was pretty much the complaint of early revisionists\nsuch as Bernstein (see Kolakowski 1978: ch. 4) and it was against that\nkind of revisionism that Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s Bolshevik writings were\na protest. (See Luk\u00e1cs 1971 [1923] and 2014 [1919].) Though\nfactual \u201crefutations\u201d of a research programme are not\nalways decisive, a Luk\u00e1cs-like indifference to the facts is,\nfor Lakatos, the mark of a fundamentally unscientific attitude. In our\nopinion, this puts paid to Ropolyi\u2019s claim that Luk\u00e1cs\ncontinued to be a major influence on the later Lakatos.\n\nLakatos left Hungary in November 1956 after the Soviet Union crushed\nthe short-lived Hungarian revolution. He walked across the border into\nAustria with his wife and her parents. Within two months he was at\nKing\u2019s College Cambridge, with a Rockefeller Fellowship to write\na PhD under the supervision of R.B. Braithwaite, which he completed in\n1959 under the title \u201cEssays in the Logic of Mathematical\nDiscovery\u201d. If we set aside his romantic adventures, the story\nof Lakatos\u2019s life thereafter is largely the story of his work,\nthough we should not forget his activities as an academic politician.\nEven his friendship with Feyerabend and his friendship and subsequent\nbust-up with Popper were very much work-related. In Britain his\nacademic career was meteoric. In 1960 he was appointed Assistant\nLecturer in Karl Popper\u2019s department at the London School of\nEconomics. By 1969 he was Professor of Logic, with a worldwide\nreputation as a philosopher of science. During the student revolts of\nthe 1960s, which in Britain were centred on the LSE, Lakatos became an\nestablishment figure. He wrote a \u201cLetter to the Director of the\nLondon School of Economics\u201d defending academic freedom and\nacademic autonomy, which was widely circulated. It denounces the\nstudent radicals for allegedly trying to do what he himself had done\nat Debrecen and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s (though he was careful to conceal the\nparallel, citing Nazi and Muscovite precedents instead) (LTD:\n247).\n\nLakatos died suddenly in 1974 of a heart attack at the height of his\npowers. He was 51. \n",
