But recently, so-called\nbest-system interpretations of chance have become\nincreasingly popular and important. While they bear some similarities\nto frequentist accounts, they avoid some of frequentism\u2019s major\nfailings; and while they are sometimes assimilated to propensity\naccounts, they are really quite distinct. So they deserve separate\ntreatment.\n\nThe best-system approach was pioneered by Lewis (1994b). His analysis\nof chance is based on his account of laws of nature (1973),\nwhich in turn refines an account due to Ramsey (1928/1990). According\nto Lewis, the laws of nature are the theorems of the best\nsystematization of the universe\u2014the true theory\nthat best combines the theoretical virtues of simplicity and\nstrength. These virtues trade off. It is easy for a theory to be\nsimple but not strong, by saying very little; it is easy for a theory\nto be strong but not simple, by conjoining lots of disparate facts.\nThe best theory balances simplicity and strength optimally\u2014in\nshort, it is the most economical true theory.\n\nSo far, there is no mention of chances. Now, we allow probabilistic\ntheories to enter the competition. We are not yet in a position to\nspeak of such theories as being true. Instead, let us introduce\nanother theoretical virtue: fit. The more probable the actual\nhistory of the universe is by the lights of the theory, the better it\nfits that history. Now the theories compete according to how well they\ncombine simplicity, strength, and fit. The theorems of the winning\ntheory are the laws of nature. Some of these laws may be\nprobabilistic. The chances are the probabilities that are determined\nby these probabilistic laws.\n\nAccording to Lewis (1986b), intermediate chances are incompatible with\ndeterminism. Loewer (2004) agrees that intermediate\npropensities are incompatible with determinism, understanding\nthose to be essentially dynamical: \u201cthey specify the\ndegree to which one state has a tendency to cause another\u201d (15).\nBut he argues that chances are best understood along Lewisian\nbest-system lines, and that there is no reason to limit them to\ndynamical chances. In particular, best-system chances may also attach\nto initial conditions: adding to the dynamical laws a\nprobability assignment, or distribution, over initial\nconditions may provide a substantial gain in strength with relatively\nlittle cost in simplicity. Science furnishes important examples of\ndeterministic theories with such initial-condition probabilities.\nAdding the so-called micro-canonical distribution to Newton\u2019s\nlaws (and the assumption that the distant past had low entropy) yields\nall of statistical mechanics; adding the so-called quantum equilibrium\ndistribution to Bohm\u2019s dynamical laws yields standard quantum\nmechanics. Indeed, this contact with actual science is one of the\nselling points of best-system analyses. See Schwarz (2016) for further\nselling points.\n\nAt first blush, best-systems analyses seem to score well on our\ncriteria of adequacy. They are admissible by definition: chances are\ndetermined by probabilistic laws (rather than by those expressed by\nsome other formalism). One could in principle ascertain values of\nprobabilities, since they supervene on what actually happens in the\nuniverse (though \u2018in principle\u2019 bears a heavy burden).\nApplicability to frequencies is secured through the role that\n\u2018fit\u2019 plays. Schwarz (2014) offers a proof of the\nPrincipal Principle, which could be taken to undergird the\nbest-systems analyses\u2019 applicability to rational beliefs and\nrational decisions. And we have just mentioned the\ninterpretation\u2019s applicability to science.\n\nThis approach solves, or at least eases, some of frequentism\u2019s\nproblems. Progress can be made on the problem of the single case. The\nchances of a rare atom decaying in various time intervals may be\ndetermined by a more pervasive functional law, in which decay chances\nare given for a far wider range of atoms by plugging in a range of\nsettings of some other magnitude (e.g., atomic number). And simplicity\nmay militate in favour of this functional law being continuous, so\neven irrational-valued probabilities may be assigned. Moreover, bare\nratios of attributes among sets of disparate objects will not qualify\nas chances if they are not pervasive enough, for then a theory that\nassigns them probabilities will lose too much simplicity without\nsufficient gain in strength.\n\nHowever, some other problems for frequentism remain, and some new ones\nemerge, beginning with more basic problems for the Lewisian account of\nlawhood itself. Some of them are partly a matter of Lewis\u2019s\nspecific formulation. Critics (e.g. van Fraassen 1989) question the\nrather nebulous notion of \u201cbalancing\u201d simplicity and\nstrength, which are themselves somewhat sketchy. But arguably some\ntechnical story (e.g. information-theoretic) could be offered to\nprecisify them. Lewis himself worries that the exchange rate for such\nbalancing may depend partly on our psychology, in which case there is\nthe threat the laws themselves depend on our psychology, an\nunpalatable idealism about them. But he maintains that this threat is\nnot serious as long as \u201cnature is kind\u201d, and one theory is\nso robustly the front-runner that it remains so under any reasonable\nstandards for balancing. And again, perhaps technical tools can offer\nsome objectivity here. (See section 4 for a gesture at such\ntools.)\n\nMore telling is the concern that simplicity is language-relative, and\nindeed that any theory can be given the simplest specification\npossible: simply abbreviate it as \\(T\\)! Lewis replies that a\ntheory\u2019s simplicity must be judged according to its\nspecification in a canonical language, in which all of the predicates\ncorrespond to natural properties. Thus, \u2018green\u2019\nmay well be eligible, but \u2018grue\u2019 surely is not. (See\nGoodman 1955.) Our abbreviation, then, has to be unpacked in terms of\nsuch a language, in which its true complexity will be revealed. But\nthis now involves a substantial metaphysical commitment to a\ndistinction between natural and unnatural properties, one that various\nempiricists (e.g. van Fraassen 1989) find objectionable.\n\nFurther problems arise with the refinement to handle probabilistic\nlaws. Again, some of them may be due to Lewis\u2019s particular\nformulation. Elga (2004) observes that Lewis\u2019s notion of fit is\nproblematic in various infinite universes\u2014think of an infinite\nsequence of tosses of a coin. Offhand, it seems that the particular\ninfinite sequence that is actualized will be assigned probability\nzero by any plausible candidate theory that regards the\nprobability of heads as intermediate and the trials as independent.\nElga argues, moreover, that there are technical difficulties with\naddressing this problem with infinitesimal probabilities. However,\nperhaps we merely need a different understanding of\n\u2018fit\u2019\u2014perhaps understood as \u2018typicality\u2019\n(Elga), or perhaps one closer to that employed by statisticians with\n\u2018chi-squared\u2019 tests of goodness of fit (Schwarz 2014).\n\nHoefer (2007) modifies Lewis\u2019s best-system account in light of\nsome of these problems. Hoefer understands \u201cbest\u201d as\n\u201cbest for us\u201d, covering regularities that are of interest\nto us, using the language both of science and of daily life, without\nany special privilege bestowed upon natural properties. Moreover, the\n\u201cbest system\u201d is now one of chances directly, rather than\nof laws. Thus, there may be chances associated with the punctuality of\ntrains, for example, without any presumption that there are any\nassociated laws. Hoefer follows Elga in understanding\n\u2018fit\u2019 as \u2018typicality\u2019. Strength is a matter of\nthe size of the overall domain of the best system\u2019s probability\nfunctions. Simplicity is to be understood in terms of elegant\nunification, and user-friendliness to beings like us. As a result,\nHoefer embraces the agent-centric nature of chances in his sense,\nregarding as essential the credence-guiding role for them that is\ncaptured by the Principal Principle. This is how his account meets the\n\u2018applicability to rational beliefs\u2019 criterion.\n\nHowever, some other problems for Lewis\u2019s account may run deeper,\nthreatening best-system analyses more generally, and symptomatic of\nthe ghost of frequentism that still hovers behind such analyses. One\nproblem for frequentism that we saw strikes at the heart of any\nattempt to reduce chances to properties of patterns of outcomes. Such\noutcomes may be highly misleading regarding the true chances,\nbecause of their probabilistic nature. This is most vivid for\nevents that are single-case by any reasonable typing. Whether or our\nuniverse turns out to be open or closed, plausibly that outcome is\ncompatible with any underlying intermediate chance. The point\ngeneralizes, however pervasive the probabilistic pattern might be.\nPlausibly, a coin\u2019s landing 9 heads out of 10 tosses is\ncompatible with any underlying intermediate chance for heads; and so\non. The pattern of outcomes that is instantiated may be a poor guide\nto the true chance. (See H\u00e1jek 2009 for further arguments\nagainst frequentism that carry over to best-system accounts.)\n\nAnother way of putting the concern is that best-system accounts\nmistake an idealized epistemology of chance for its metaphysics\n(though see Lewis\u2019 insistence that this is not the case, in his\n1994). Such accounts single out three theoretical virtues\u2014and\none may wonder why just those three\u2014and reifies the\nprobabilities of a theory that displays the virtues to the highest\ndegree. But a probabilistic world may be recalcitrant to even the best\ntheorizing: nature may be unkind.\n4. Conclusion: Recent Trends, Future Prospects\n\nIt should be clear from the foregoing that there is still much work to\nbe done regarding the interpretations of probability. Each\ninterpretation that we have canvassed seems to capture some crucial\ninsight into a concept of it, yet falls short of doing complete\njustice to this concept. Perhaps the full story about probability is\nsomething of a patchwork, with partially overlapping pieces and\nprinciples about how they ought to relate. In that sense, the above\ninterpretations might be regarded as complementary, although to be\nsure each may need some further refinement. My bet, for what it is\nworth, is that we will retain the distinct notions of physical,\nlogical/evidential, and subjective probability, with a rich tapestry\nof connections between them.\n\nThere are further signs of the rehabilitation of classical and logical\nprobability, and in particular the principle of indifference and the\nprinciple of maximum entropy, by authors such as Paris and\nVencovsk\u00e1 (1997), Maher (2000, 2001), Bartha and Johns (2001),\nNovack (2010), White (2010), and Pettigrew (2016). However, Rinard\n(2014) argues that the principle of indifference leads to incoherence\neven when imprecise probabilities are allowed. Eva (2019) resurrects\nthe principle as a constraint on comparative probabilities of\nthe form \u2018I am more confident in p than in\nq\u2019 or \u2018I am equally confident in p and\nq\u2019. This, in turn, showcases another recent trend: an\nincreased interest in comparative probabilities.\n\nRelevant here may also be advances in information theory and\ncomplexity theory. Information theory uses probabilities to define the\ninformation in a particular event, the degree of uncertainty in a\nrandom variable, and the mutual information between random variables\n(Shannon 1948, Shannon & Weaver 1949). This theory has been\ndeveloped extensively to give accounts of complexity, optimal data\ncompression and encoding (Kolmogorov 1965, Li and Vitanyi 1997, Cover\nand Thomas 2006; see the entry on\n information\n for more details). It is applied across the sciences, from its\nnatural home in computer science and communication theory, to physics\nand biology. Interpreting information in these areas goes hand-in-hand\nwith interpreting the underlying probabilities: each concept of\nprobability has a corresponding concept of information. For example,\nScarantino (2015) offers an account of \u2018natural\ninformation\u2019 in biology that is compatible with either a logical\ninterpretation of probability or objective Bayesian interpretation,\nwhile Kraemer (2015) offers one that rests on a finite frequency\ninterpretation.\n\nInformation theory has also proved to be fruitful in the study of\nrandomness (Kolmogorov 1965, Martin-L\u00f6f 1966), which obviously is\nintimately related to the notion of probability \u2013 see Eagle\n(2016), and the entry on\n chance versus randomness.\n Refinements of our understanding of randomness, in turn, should have\na bearing on the frequency interpretations (recall von Mises\u2019\nappeal to randomness in his definition of a \u2018collective\u2019),\nand on propensity accounts (especially those that make explicit ties\nto frequencies). Given the apparent connection between propensities\nand causation adumbrated in Section 3.5, powerful causal modelling\nmethods should also prove fruitful here. More generally, the theory of\ngraphical causal models (also known as Bayesian networks) uses\ndirected acyclic graphs to represent causal relationships in a system.\n(See Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines 1993, Pearl 2000, Woodward 2003.)\nThe graphs and the probabilities of the system\u2019s variables\nharmonize in accordance with the causal Markov condition, a\nsophisticated version of Reichenbach\u2019s slogan \u201cno\ncorrelation without causation\u201d. (See the entry on\n causal models\n for more details.) Thus again, each understanding of probability has\na counterpart understanding of causal networks.\n\nRegarding best-system interpretations of chance, I noted that it is\nsomewhat unclear exactly what \u2018simplicity\u2019 and\n\u2018strength\u2019 consist in, and exactly how they are to be\nbalanced. Perhaps insights from statistics and computer science may be\nhelpful here: approaches to statistical model selection, and in\nparticular the \u2018curve-fitting\u2019 problem, that attempt to\ncharacterize simplicity, and its trade-off with strength \u2014 e.g.,\nthe Akaike Information Criterion (see Forster and Sober 1994), the\nBayesian Information Criterion (see Kiesepp\u00e4 2001), Minimum\nDescription Length theory (see Rissanen 1999) and Minimum Message\nLength theory (see Wallace and Dowe 1999).\n\nPhysical probabilities are becoming even more crucial to scientific\ninquiry. Probabilities are not just used to characterize the support\ngiven to scientific theories by evidence; they appear essentially in\nthe content of the theories themselves. This has led to fertile\nphilosophical ground interpreting the probabilities in such theories.\nFor example, quantum mechanics has physical probabilities at the\nfundamental level. The interpretation of these probabilities is\nrelated to the interpretation of the theory itself (see the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n Statistical mechanics and evolutionary theory have non-fundamental\nobjective probabilities. Are they genuine chances? How can we account\nfor them? See Strevens (2003) and Lyon (2011) for discussion. However,\nSchwarz (2018) argues that these probabilities can and should be left\nuninterpreted. Loewer (2012, 2020) proposes that the Lewisian best\nsystem of our world is given by \u201cthe\nMentaculus\u201d\u2014a complete probability map of the\nuniverse. This is Albert\u2019s (2000) package of:\n\nthe fundamental dynamical laws of statistical mechanics;\nthe claim that initially the universe was in a microstate \\(M(0)\\)\nwhose entropy was tiny (\u201cthe Past Hypothesis\u201d);\nand a law specifying a uniform probability distribution over the\nmicro-states that realize \\(M(0).\\)\n\n\nAnother ongoing debate regarding physical probabilities concerns\nwhether chance is compatible with determinism\u2014see, e.g.,\nSchaffer (2007), who is an incompatibilist, and Ismael (2009) and\nLoewer (2020), who are compatibilists. Handfield and Wilson (2014)\nargue that chance ascriptions are context-sensitive, varying according\nto the relevant \u201cevidence base\u201d. This captures the thought\nthat in a deterministic universe, there is some sense in\nwhich all chances are extreme, while doing justice to other\ncompatibilist usages of chance. See Frigg (2016) for an overview of\nthis debate. Relatedly, an important approach to objective probability\nthat has gained popularity involves the so-called method of\narbitrary functions. Originating with Poincar\u00e9 (1896), it\nis a mathematical technique for determining probability functions for\ncertain systems with chaotic dynamical laws mapping input conditions\nto outcomes. Roughly speaking, the probabilities for the outcomes are\nrelatively insensitive to the probabilities over the various initial\nconditions \u2014 think of how the probabilities of outcomes of spins\nof a roulette wheel apparently do not depend on how the wheel is spun,\nsometimes vigorously, sometimes feebly. See Strevens (2003, 2013) for\ndetailed treatments of this approach.\n\nThe subjectivist theory of probability is also thriving\u2014indeed,\nit has been the biggest growth area among all the interpretations,\nthanks to the burgeoning of formal epistemology in the last couple of\ndecades. For each of the topics that I will briefly mention, I can\nonly cite a few representative works.\n\nEspecially since Joyce (1998), accuracy arguments for various\nBayesian norms have been influential. They include arguments for\nconditionalization (Greaves and Wallace 2006, Briggs and Pettigrew\n2020), the Reflection Principle (Easwaran 2013), and the Principal\nPrinciple (Pettigrew 2016). However, Mahtani (2021) argues that the\nmathematical theorems that are invoked to support the accuracy\napproach do not justify probabilism. These lines of research continue\nto develop. And these norms themselves have received further\nattention\u2014e.g. Schoenfield (2017) on conditionalization, and\nHall (1994, 2004), Ismael (2008), and Briggs (2009) on the Principal\nPrinciple.\n\nYet for some problems, Bayesian modelling seems not to be sufficiently\nnuanced. A recently flourishing area has concerned modelling an\nagent\u2019s self-locating credences, concerning who she is,\nor what time it is. The contents of such credences are usually taken\nto be richer than just propositions (thought of as sets of possible\nworlds); rather, they are finer-grained propositions (sets of centered\nworlds \u2014 see Lewis 1979). This in turn has ramifications for\nupdating rules, in particular calling conditionalization into\nquestion\u2014see Meacham (2008). The so-called Sleeping Beauty\nproblem (Elga 2000) has generated much discussion in this regard. See\nTitelbaum (2012) for a comprehensive study and approach to such\nproblems, Titelbaum (2016), and the entry on self-locating beliefs for\na survey of the literature. These continue to be fertile areas of\nresearch.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another sense in which Bayesian modelling\nhas been regarded as too nuanced. It seems to be\npsychologically unrealistic to portray humans (rather than\nideally rational agents) as having degrees of belief that are\ninfinitely precise real numbers. Thus, there have been various\nattempts to \u2018humanize\u2019 Bayesianism, and this line of\nresearch is gaining momentum. For example, there has been a\nflourishing study of imprecise probability and imprecise decision\ntheory, in which credences need not be precise numbers\u2014for\nexample, they could be sets of numbers, or intervals. See\nhttp://www.sipta.org/ for up-to-date research in this area. This\nresonates with recent work on whether imprecise probabilities are\nrationally required\u2014H\u00e1jek and Smithson (2012) and Isaacs,\nH\u00e1jek, and Hawthorne (2022) on the pro side, Schoenfield (2017)\non the con side. The debate continues.\n\nNor is it plausible that humans obey all the theorems of the\nprobability calculus\u2014we are incoherent in all sorts of ways. The\nlast couple of decades have also seen research on degrees of\nincoherence\u2014measuring the extent of departures from obedience to\nthe probability calculus\u2014including Zynda (1996), Schervish,\nSeidenfeld and Kadane (2003), De Bona and Staffel (2017, 2018), and\nStaffel (2019). Lin (2013) sees traditional epistemology\u2019s\nnotion of belief as appropriate for humans who fall short of\nthe Bayesian ideal, but who nevertheless may obey various doxastic\nnorms that can be given Bayesian endorsement. He models everyday\npractical reasoning, with qualitative beliefs and desires, providing a\nqualitative decision theory and representation theorem. Easwaran\n(2016) takes humans to genuinely have all-or-nothing beliefs, but\noffers an instrumentalist justification for representing\nthose beliefs with probabilities.\n\nIt also a fact of life that humans disagree with each other.\nHow should an agent modify her credences (if at all) when she\ndisagrees on some claim with an epistemic peer\u2014someone\nwho has the same evidence as her, and whom she regards as equally good\nat evaluating that evidence? The literature on this topic is huge (see\nKopec and Titelbaum (2016) for a survey, and the entry on\n disagreement),\n and it connects in important ways with the interpretations of\nprobability. Intuitively, we feel that disagreement with an epistemic\npeer rationally calls for moving one\u2019s opinion in the direction\nof theirs, since disagreement with a peer seems to be evidence that\none has made a mistake in evaluating one\u2019s initial evidence. As\nKelly (2010) argues, this \u2018conciliationist\u2019 intuition\nappears to commit us to the evidential interpretation of probability,\nwith the common evidence bestowing a unique probability on the\ndisputed claim. (See Schoenfield 2014 and Titelbaum 2016 for dissent;\nfor a defense of the Uniqueness Thesis more generally, see Horowitz\nand Dogramaci 2016.) The intuition also appears to commit us to\nprobabilistic enkrasia: the view that our credences are\nbeholden to our attitudes about evidential probabilities, in\nmuch the same way as the Principal Principle portrays our credences as\nbeholden to our attitudes about chances. (See Christensen 2013 and\nElga 2010 for versions of probabilistic enkrasia principles.)\nLet\u2019s grant that disagreement with a peer about some claim is\nevidence that one has made a mistake regarding it. This should affect\none\u2019s opinion in it only if one\u2019s attitude about the\ncorrect way to evaluate the evidence constrains one\u2019s\nattitude about the claim. However, probabilistic enkrasia has been\ncriticised (see Williamson 2014; Lasonen-Aarnio 2015).\n\nWe thus come back full circle to where we started. The classical and\nlogical/evidential interpretations sought to capture an objective\nnotion of probability that measures evidential support relations.\nEarly proponents of the subjective interpretation gave us a highly\npermissive notion of rational credences, constrained only by the\nprobability calculus. Less liberal subjectivists added further\nrationality constraints, with credences beholden to attitudes about\nphysical probabilities, and to evidential probabilities\u2014at an\nextreme, to the point of uniqueness. The three kinds of concepts of\nprobability that we identified at the outset converge:\nepistemological, degrees of confidence, and physical. Future research\nwill doubtless explore further the relationships between\nthem\u2014and how they provide guides to life.\nSuggested Further Reading\n\nKyburg (1970) contains a vast bibliography of the literature on\nprobability and induction pre-1970. Also useful for references before\n1967 is the bibliography for \u201cProbability\u201d in the\nMacmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Earman (1992) and\nHowson and Urbach (1993) have large bibliographies, and give detailed\npresentations of the Bayesian program. H\u00e1jek and Hitchcock\n(2021 [Other Internet Resources]) has a more recent and extensive\nannotated bibliography for all the interpretations of probability\ndiscussed in this entry. Skyrms (2000) is an excellent introduction to\nthe philosophy of probability.  Von Plato (1994) is more technically\ndemanding and more historically oriented, with another extensive\nbibliography that has references to many landmarks in the development\nof probability theory in the last century. Fine (1973) is still a\nhighly sophisticated survey of and contribution to various\nfoundational issues in probability, with an emphasis on\ninterpretations. More recent philosophical studies of the leading\ninterpretations include Childers (2013), Gillies (2000b), Galavotti\n(2005), Huber (2019), and Mellor (2005). H\u00e1jek and Hitchcock\n(2016) is a collection of original survey articles on philosophical\nissues related to probability. Section IV includes chapters on most of\nthe major interpretations of probability. It also includes coverage of\nthe history of probability, Kolmogorov\u2019s formalism and\nalternatives, and applications of probability in science and\nphilosophy. Joyce (2011) is a thorough survey of subjective\nBayesianism; Titelbaum (2022) is a wide-ranging and accessible\nintroduction to Bayesian epistemology. H\u00e1jek and Lin (2017)\ncanvass various respects of similarity and dissimilarity between\nBayesian epistemology and traditional epistemology. Knauff and Spohn\n(2021) is a comprehensive open access handbook on many topics\nconcerning rationality; the chapter by H\u00e1jek and Staffel (2021)\nelaborates on a number of issues raised in this entry\u2019s\ndiscussion of subjective probability. Eagle (2010) is a valuable\nanthology of many significant papers in the philosophy of probability,\nwith detailed and incisive critical discussions. Billingsley (1995)\nand Feller (1968) are classic, rather advanced textbooks on the\nmathematical theory of probability. Ross (2013) is less advanced and\nhas lots of examples.",
