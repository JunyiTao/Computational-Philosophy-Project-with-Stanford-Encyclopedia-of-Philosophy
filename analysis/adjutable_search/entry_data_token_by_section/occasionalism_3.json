    "main_text": "The History of Occasionalism || Nicolas Malebranche\n1.4 Nicolas Malebranche\n\nGiven Malebranche\u2019s influence on the development of\noccasionalism, a substantial portion of the section on the arguments\nfor occasionalism will be devoted Malebranche\u2019s views. Here we\nsimply note that Malebranche appears to have been committed to\noccasionalism from early on in his philosophical career, since his\noccasionalism emerges clearly in his first major work, The Search\nfor Truth (De la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\n1674\u201375). In addition to the Search, Malebranche in the\nElucidations to the Search presents a long defense of his\noccasionalism against objections. And in the Dialogues we get\nMalebranche\u2019s second major work to discuss the thesis of\noccasionalism centrally. Whether or in what way Malebranche\u2019s\nviews were influenced by earlier occasionalists, as discussed earlier,\nwill not be centrally addressed here, given the limitations of\n space.[7]\n We will however compare some of Malebranche\u2019s arguments with\nhis predecessors when relevant.\n",
