    "main_text": "Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy || Illumination\n6.2 Illumination\n\n\nRelevant to Islamic\u2014and Maimonidean\u2014ideas about the active\nintellect's role in knowing and prophecy in particular is Aristotle's\nadditional description of this active intellectual principle as\nanalogous to light. Especially for the Neoplatonic Islamic readers of\nDe Anima, this\nreference to light opens an interpretive floodgate, offering a clear\ncrossover from talk of a separable, immortal active intellect (in\nDe Anima 3.5) to overtly illuminationist and emanationist\nNeoplatonic doctrines (in the Theology of Aristotle). For, in\nthe Theology of Aristotle (as in Plotinus' original Greek\nwritings, and as in Neoplatonic texts more generally), one finds\nabundant metaphors of light used to describe the elusive process of\nemanation through which the world exists. Looking to the Neoplatonic\ncosmologies of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, we additionally find metaphors\nof light to describe the unique influence that the active intellect\ncasts over the sublunar world. In the metaphorical idea of a light pouring\ndown from active intellect, there emerges the ontological idea that\nthis intellect emanates forth the very form of the world. There emerges too the epistemological\nidea of illumination\u2014the idea that human knowledge is actualized\nnot by mere encounter with the world, and not merely by some mechanism\ninternal to the individual's mind, but by the active intellect as a\n\u201csource of enlightenment\u201d which pours down on it, as it\nwere. Here seen in its epistemological role, the active intellect\n\u201cilluminates\u201d the human mind, enabling it to become filled with truths (in one or another way; see previous section on differences in this regard between al-Farabi and Avicenna). For Al-Farabi and Avicenna, as for\nMaimonides, this illuminationist tendency (rooted at least in part, we\nmight say, in the De Anima 3.5 notion of light) goes hand in\nhand with a complex Aristotelian account of the workings of the\nindividual human mind in the attainment of knowledge. Their commitment\nto a complex Aristotelian epistemology and psychology, however, is\ntempered with a doctrine of illumination on which the active intellect\nplays a key role in the final attainment of knowledge\u2014including\nprophecy. For Maimonides, as for his Islamic predecessors, active\nintellect is like a light: it is the overflowing illuminating fount of\nhuman intellection and prophecy.\n",
