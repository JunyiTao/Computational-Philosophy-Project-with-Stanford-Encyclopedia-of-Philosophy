    "main_text": "The Nature of Judgment || Judgments are essentially propositional cognitions\n1.2 Judgments are essentially propositional cognitions\n\nBut what exactly are judgments? Kant\u2019s answer, in a\nnutshell, is that they are essentially propositional\ncognitions\u2014from which it immediately follows that rational\nhumans are, more precisely, propositional animals. In what\nsense, however, is this the case?\n\nLogicians before Kant, e.g., the Port Royalists, tended to define\njudgment as a \u201crepresentation of a relation between two\nconcepts\u201d (B140). This pre-Kantian definition implied that all\njudgments are of subject-predicate form; but in fact, as Kant points\nout (here following the Stoic logicians), some judgments\u2014e.g.,\ndisjunctive judgments, and hypothetical conditional\njudgments\u2014are truth-valued relational complexes of\nsubject-predicate judgments and thus, apparently, have essentially\ntruth-functional form, not subject-predicate form. This idea\nlater heavily influenced George Boole\u2019s ground-breaking view of\nlogic as a set of a priori \u201claws of thought\u201d governing a\nformal calculus of binary functions that mimic the\n\u201cbipolar\u201d behavior of the classical truth and falsity of\npropositions (Boole 1854). Perhaps even more importantly however, the\npre-Kantian definition also failed to explain the unity of a\njudgment, and the difference between a judgment and a mere list of\nconcepts. So in order to solve this\n\u201cunity-of-the-judgment\u201d problem\u2014which later\nre-surfaced as \u201cthe problem of the unity of the\nproposition\u201d in early analytic philosophy (Hylton 1984, Linsky\n1992)\u2014Kant offers a radically new conception of the judgment as\na higher-order cognitive binding function for different types of\nlower-order objective representational content. In a pre-Critical\nessay, \u201cThe False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic\nFigures,\u201d he says that a judgment is an act of logical\npredication whereby a concept is applied to a thing, as expressed by\nthe copula \u2018is\u2019 or \u2018are\u2019 (2: 47). In his\nlogical textbook, the J\u00e4sche Logic, he says that it is a\nrepresentation of the unity of consciousness linking together several\nother representations, or a representation of their relation in a\nsingle concept (9: 101). And in the Critique of Pure Reason\nhe characterizes judgment at least four times:\n\nJudgment is \u2026 the mediate cognition of an object, hence the\nrepresentation of a representation of it. In every judgment there is a\nconcept that holds of many [representations], and that among this many\nalso comprehends a given representation, which is then immediately\nreferred to the object. (A68/B93)\n\n\nAll judgments are \u2026 functions of unity among our\nrepresentations, since instead of an immediate representation a higher\none, which comprehends this and other representations under itself, is\nused for the cognition of the object, and many possible cognitions are\nhereby drawn together into one. (A69/B94)\n\n\nA judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given cognitions to\nthe objective unity of apperception. That is the aim\nof the copula is in them: to distinguish the\nobjective unity of given representations from the subjective. (B141).\n\n\n[Pure general logic] deals with concepts,\njudgments, and inferences,\ncorresponding exactly to the functions and order of those powers of\nthe mind, which are comprehended under the broad designation of\nunderstanding in general\u2026 If the understanding in general is\nexplained as the faculty of rules, then the power of judgment is the\nfaculty of subsuming under rules, i.e., of\ndetermining whether something stands under a given rule (casus\ndatae legis) or not. (A130\u2013132/B170\u2013172)\n\n\nDespite the superficial differences in emphasis and formulation, these\nsix characterizations all converge on the same basic account: a\njudgment is a higher-order complex conscious cognition that refers to\nobjects either directly (via the essentially indexical content of\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions)or indirectly (via the\nessentially attributive or descriptive content of concepts); in which\nconcepts are predicated either of those objects or of other\nconstituent concepts; in which concepts are intrinsically related to\none another and to intuitional/non-conceptual cognitions by pure\ngeneral logical forms/pure concepts of the understanding that express\nvarious modifications and, apparently, truth-functional compounds of\nthe predicative copula; which enters into inferences according to a\npriori laws of pure general logic; which essentially involves both the\nfollowing of rules and the application of rules to the perceptual\nobjects picked out by intuition/non-conceptual cognition; and in which\na composite objective representation is generated and unified by the\nhigher-order executive mental processing of a single self-conscious\nrational subject. The crucial take-away points here are (a) a\njudgment\u2019s referential bottoming-out in\nintuitions/non-conceptual cognitions, which thereby constitute\ndirectly-referential singular terms in singular categorical judgments,\nthat cannot be semantically replaced by individual concepts or\ndefinite descriptions without change or loss of meaning (contrast,\ne.g., Thompson 1972 and Hanna 2001, ch. 4), (b) the \u201cprivileging\nof predication\u201d (Longuenesse 1998, 104) over other sorts of\nlogical operations, (c) the intrinsic logico-syntactic and\nlogico-semantic form of the judgment, based on modifications or\ncompound truth-functional relations of the predicative copula, (d) the\nrule-like character of the judgment, (e) the judgment\u2019s unified\nconscious objective representational (i.e., semantic) content, and\nabove all (f) its higher-order rationally self-conscious ground of\nobjective unity. As such, Kantian judgments are neither\nmerely psychological objects or processes (as in psychologistic\ntheories of judgment), nor are they essentially\nmind-independent, abstract objects (as in platonistic theories of\njudgment), nor again are they inherently assertoric takings\nof propositions to be true (as, e.g., in Frege\u2019s theory of\njudgment). Instead, Kantian judgments are intersubjectively shareable,\nrationally communicable, cognitively-generated mental-act structures\nor types whose logically-structured truth-apt semantic contents can be\nthe targets of many different kinds of epistemic or non-epistemic\npropositional attitudes. \n\nAs just noted, every judgment has an intrinsic logical form\nthat is both syntactic and semantic in nature, centered on\npredication. Even more fundamentally however, every judgment also has\nan \u201cintension\u201d (Inhalt) or semantic\ncontent: the \u201cproposition\u201d (Satz). A\npropositional content is not monolithic but rather a unified composite\nof individually meaningful proper parts. More specifically, a\nproposition is the logically well-formed and semantically\nwell-composed, truth-valued, unified objective representational\ncontent of a judgment; and more generally it is \u201cwhat is\njudged\u201d in the act of putting forward any sort of rational claim\nabout the world (9: 109) (14: 659\u2013660) (24: 934). Although a\nproposition is always generated by means of psychological processes,\nit is not, however, psychologically private and\nincommunicable: on the contrary, it is intersubjectively shareable and\nrationally communicable, due to the fact that the very same\npropositional form-and-content can be individually generated by many\ndifferent judging animals, provided they are all equipped with the\nsame basic cognitive architecture. In this way judgments for Kant are\nessentially propositional cognitions, in that the primary\nfunction of the faculty of judgment is just to generate these\nlogically well-formed, semantically well-composed, truth-valued,\nintersubjectively shareable, rationally communicable, unified\nobjective representational contents.\n\nGiven the seminal role of the judgment\u2019s propositional content,\nit is easy to see then that for Kant the propositional function of the\njudgment is more basic than its inferential role\u2014although every\njudgment does indeed play an inferential role (Longuenesse 1998,\n90\u201395)\u2014and for this reason Kant\u2019s logical constants\n(i.e., all, some, this/the, affirmation, propositional negation,\npredicate-negation, the predicative copula, if-then, disjunction,\nnecessarily, possibly, and actually) are defined strictly in terms of\ntheir specific roles in the propositional content of judgments, quite\napart from the ways those judgments can enter into inferences\n(A69\u201376/B94\u2013102). In recent years, however,\ninferentialist treatments of Kant\u2019s theory of judgment\nand Kant\u2019s logic, which treat the semantic contents and logical\nconstants of judgment as essentially dependent on and determined by\ntheir inferential roles, have become increasingly popular and\ninfluential (see, e.g., Landy 2009 and Leech 2012).\n",
