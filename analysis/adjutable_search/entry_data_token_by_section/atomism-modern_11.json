    "main_text": "Atomism in Nineteenth-Century Physics || The Kinetic Theory of Gases\n5.1 The Kinetic Theory of Gases\n\n\nThe first atomic theory that had empirical support independent of the\nphenomena it was designed to explain was the kinetic theory of\ngases. This discussion will pass over the historical detail of the\nemergence of the theory and consider the mature statistical theory as\ndeveloped by Maxwell from 1859 (Niven, (1965, Vol. 1, 377\u2013409, Vol. 2,\n26\u201378) and developed further by Boltzmann (1872).\n\n\nThe theory attributed the behaviour of gases to the motions and\nelastic collisions of a large number of molecules. The motions were\nconsidered to be randomly distributed in the gas, while the motion of\neach molecule was governed by the laws of mechanics both during and in\nbetween collisions. It was necessary to assume that molecules acted on\neach other only during collision, that their volume was small compared\nwith the total volume of the gas and that the time spent in collision\nis small compared to the time that elapses between collisions. While\nthe molecules needed to be assumed to be small, they needed to be\nsufficiently large that they could not move uninterrupted through the\ngas. The irregular path of a molecule through the body of a gas from\ncollision to collision was necessary to explain rates of\ndiffusion.\n\n\nThe kinetic theory was able to explain the gas laws connecting volume,\ntemperature and pressure. It also predicted Avogadro\u2019s law that\nequal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules and so\nexplained Gay Lussac's law also. This legitimated the use of vapour\ndensities for the determination of relative molecular weights.  This\nin turn led to definitive atomic weights and formulae that coincided\nwith those that organic chemistry had yielded by the 1860\u2019s. The\nkinetic theory of gases also explained the laws of diffusion and even\npredicted a novel phenomena that was quite counter-intuitive, namely,\nthat the viscosity of a gas, the property that determines its ease of\nflow and the ease with which objects flow through it, is independent\nof its density. Counter-intuitive or not, the prediction was confirmed\nby experiment.\n\n\nIt was known from experiment that the behaviour of gases diverges from\nthe gas laws as pressure is increased and they approach\nliquefaction. The gas laws were presumed to apply to \u2018ideal\ngases\u2019 as opposed to real gases. The behaviour of real gases\napproaches that of ideal gases as their pressure is reduced. The\nkinetic theory had an explanation for this distinction, for at high\npressure the assumptions of the kinetic theory, that the volume of\nmolecules is small compared with the total volume of the gas they form\npart of and that the time spent in collision is small compared to the\ntime between collisions, become increasingly inaccurate. The theory\nwas able to predict various ways in which a real gas will diverge from\nthe ideal gas laws at high pressures (Van der Waals equation) and\nthese were confirmed by experiments on gases approaching\nliquefaction.\n\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases explained a range of experimental laws and\nsuccessfully predicted new ones. However, there were some key\ndifficulties. One of them was the departure of experimentally measured\nvalues of the ratio of the two specific heats of a gas, measured at\nconstant pressure and at constant volume, from what the theory\npredicted. This prediction followed from a central tenet of the theory\nthat energy is distributed equally amongst the degrees of freedom of a\nmolecule. The difficulty could be mitigated by assuming that molecules\nof monatomic gases were perfectly smooth spheres that could not be set\nrotating and that diatomic molecules were also smooth to the extent\nthat they could not be set rotating about the axis joining the two\natoms in the molecule. But, as Maxwell made clear, (Niven, 1965, Vol.\n2, 433) it must be possible for molecules to vibrate in a number of\nmodes in order to give rise to the spectra of radiation that they emit\nand absorb, and once this is admitted the predictions of the theory\nclash unavoidably with the measured specific heats.\n\n\nThe second major difficulty stemmed from the time reversibility of the\nkinetic theory. The time inverse of any process is as allowable as the\noriginal within the kinetic theory. This clashes with the time\nasymmetry of the second law of thermodynamics and the\ntime-directedness of the observed behaviour of gases. Heat flows\nspontaneously from hot regions to cold regions and gases in contact\nspontaneously mix rather than separate. It is true that defenders of\nthe kinetic theory such as Maxwell and Boltzmann were able to\naccommodate the difficulty by stressing the statistical nature of the\ntheory and attributing time asymmetries to asymmetries in initial\nconditions. But this meant that a fundamental tenet of thermodynamics,\nthe second law, was in fact only statistically true. Violations were\nimprobable rather than impossible.  Defenders of the kinetic theory\nhad no direct experimental evidence for deviations from the second\nlaw.\n",
