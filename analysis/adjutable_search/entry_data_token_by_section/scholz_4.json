    "main_text": "Work || Philosophy of Religion\n3.1 Philosophy of Religion\n\nScholz dedicated his Religionsphilosophie (1921) to his\nteachers Adolf von Harnack and Alois Riehl (on Scholz\u2019s\nphilosophy of religion cf. Molendijk 1991, Ratschow 1958, Stock 1987,\nWimmer 2005). According to Scholz philosophy of religion does not deal\nwith religion as such, but with its possibility, based on the fact of\nits reality in the sense of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy (p.\nVIII). Religion becomes, thus, a philosophical problem. Scholz defines\nphilosophy of religion in the widest sense as the application of\nphilosophical means and presupposition of reasoning to the fact of\nreligion (pp. 1\u20132). Religion is understood as part of culture\nbeing the epitome of creations of the human mind, the existence of\nwhich is preferred to their non-existence (p. 14). The object of\nanalysis is empirical religion, i.e. religion as it is practiced in\nreal life or as it is tangible. With this he deviates from\nconstructive types of the philosophy of religion as they can be found,\ne.g., in the work of Immanuel Kant. In conclusion, he determines that\nphilosophy of religion has an integrating function in a philosophy of\ncultural values. It consists in philosophical reflection on tangible\n(erlebbare) religion as it is practiced and, in particular,\nin reflection on expressions of religious consciousness whose truth is\nsubject to reason. Therefore religion has never ceased to be a\nphilosophical problem.\n",
