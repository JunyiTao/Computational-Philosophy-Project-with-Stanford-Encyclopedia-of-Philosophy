Statement\n(1) involves both empirical claims, and moral claims, but the\nempirical claims are surely true, and, setting aside the question of\nthe existence of objective rightmaking and wrongmaking properties, the\nmoral claims are surely also very plausible. The other four premises,\nset out at steps (3), (5), (7) and (9), are plausibly viewed as\nanalytic truths.\n\nAs regards the logic of the argument, all of the steps in the\nargument, other than the inference from (1) to (2), are deductive, and\nare either clearly valid as they stand, or could be made so by trivial\nexpansions of the argument at the relevant points. The upshot,\naccordingly, is that the above argument appears to stand or fall with\nthe defensibility of the inductive inference from (1) to (2). The\ncrucial questions, accordingly, are, first, exactly what the form of\nthat inductive inference is, and, secondly, whether it is sound.\n\n3.2.2 A Natural Account of the Logic of the Inductive Step\n\nA familiar and very common sort of inductive inference involves\nmoving from information to the effect that all observed things of a\ncertain type have a certain property to the conclusion that absolutely\nall things of the type in question have the relevant property. Could\nthe inductive step in the evidential argument from evil perhaps be of\nthat form?\n\nOne philosopher who has suggested that this is the case is William\nRowe, in his 1991 article, \u201cRuminations about Evil\u201d. Let us consider,\nthen, whether that view can be sustained.\n\nIn that article, Rowe formulates the premise of the crucial inference\nas follows:\n\n(P) No good state of affairs that we know of is such that an\nomnipotent, omniscient being\u2019s obtaining it would morally justify\nthat being\u2019s permitting E1 or E2. (1991, 72)\n\n\n\n(Here \u201cE1\u201d refers to a case of a fawn who dies in\nlingering and terrible fashion as a result of a forest fire, and\n\u201cE2\u201d to the case of a young girl who is brutally\nraped, beaten, and murdered.)\n\nCommenting on P, Rowe emphasizes that what proposition\nP says is not simply that we cannot see how various goods\nwould justify an omnipotent, omniscient being\u2019s permitting\nE1 or E2, but rather,\n\nThe good states of affairs I know of, when I reflect on them, meet\none or both of the following conditions: either an omnipotent being\ncould obtain them without having to permit either\nE1 or E2, or obtaining them wouldn\u2019t morally justify that being in permitting\nE1 or E2. (1991, 72)\n\n\nRowe then goes on to say that:\n\u2026 if this is so, I have reason to\nconclude that:\n\n \n(Q) No good state of affairs is such that an omnipotent,\nomniscient being\u2019s obtaining it would morally justify that\nbeing\u2019s permitting E1 or E2.\n \n(1991, 72)\n\n\nRowe uses the letter \u2018J\u2019 \u201cto stand for the property\na good has just in case obtaining that good would justify an\nomnipotent, omniscient being in permitting E1 or\nE2\u201d (1991, 73). When this is done, the above\ninference can be compactly represented as follows:\n\n(P)\n\nNo good that we know of has J.\n    \n\n\nTherefore, probably:\n\n(Q)\n\nNo good has J.\n    \n\n\nRowe next refers to Plantinga\u2019s criticism of this inference, and\nhe argues that Plantinga\u2019s criticism now amounts to the claim\nthat\n\nwe are justified in inferring Q (No good has J)\nfrom P (No good we know of has J) only if we have a\ngood reason to think that if there were a good that has\nJ it would be a good that we are acquainted with and could\nsee to have J. For the question can be raised: How can we\nhave confidence in this inference unless we have a good reason to\nthink that were a good to have J it would likely be a good\nwithin our ken?  (1991, 73)\n\n\nRowe\u2019s response is then as follows:\n\nMy answer is that we are justified in making this inference in the\nsame way we are justified in making the many inferences we constantly\nmake from the known to the unknown. All of us are constantly inferring\nfrom the \\(A\\)s we know of to the \\(A\\)s we\ndon\u2019t know of. If we observe many \\(A\\)s and note that\nall of them are \\(B\\)s we are justified in believing that\nthe As we haven\u2019t observed are also\n\\(B\\)s. Of course, these inferences may be defeated. We may\nfind some independent reason to think that if an \\(A\\) were a\n\\(B\\) it would likely not be among the \\(A\\)s we have\nobserved.  But to claim that we cannot be justified in making such\ninferences unless we already know, or have good reason to believe,\nthat were an \\(A\\) not to be a \\(B\\) it would likely be\namong the As we\u2019ve observed is simply to encourage\nradical skepticism concerning inductive reasoning in general. (1991,\n73)\n\n\nFinally, Rowe points out that:\n\n\u2026 in considering the inference from\nP to Q it is very important to distinguish two\ncriticisms:\n\n\nOne is entitled to infer Q from P only if she\nhas a good reason to think that if some good had J it would\nbe a good that she knows of.\nOne is entitled to infer Q from P only if she\nhas no reason to think that if some good had J it would\nlikely not be a good that she knows of.\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s criticism is of type (A). For the reason given, it is\nnot a cogent criticism. But a criticism of type (B) is entirely proper\nto advance against any inductive inference of the sort we are\nconsidering.  (1991, 73\u20134)\n\n\nIn view of the last point, Rowe concludes that \u201cone important route\nfor the theist to explore is whether there is some reason to think\nthat were a good to have J it either would not be a good\nwithin our ken or would be such that although we apprehend this good\nwe are incapable of determining that it has J,\u201d (1991, 74).\n3.2.3 An Evaluation of this Account of the Inductive Step\n\nFirst, Rowe is right that a criticism of type (A) does involve\n\u201cradical skepticism of inductive reasoning in\ngeneral\u201d. But, secondly, having granted that point, how\nsatisfactory is Rowe\u2019s account of the reasoning involved?  To answer\nthat question, what one needs to notice is that Rowe\u2019s claim that\n\u201cif we observe many \\(A\\)s and note that all of them are\n\\(B\\)s we are justified in believing that the \\(A\\)s we\nhaven\u2019t observed are also \\(B\\)s\u201d is somewhat ambiguous,\nsince while the claim that \u201cwe are justified in believing that\nthe \\(A\\)s we haven\u2019t observed are also \\(B\\)s\u201d might\nnaturally be interpreted as saying\n\nWe are justified in believing that all the\n\\(A\\)s that we haven\u2019t observed are also\n\\(B\\)s\n\n\nit is possible to construe it as making, instead, the following,\nmuch weaker claim\n\nWe are justified in believing of each of the\n\\(A\\)s that we haven\u2019t observed that that \\(A\\)\nis also a \\(B\\).\n\n\nLet us consider, then, the relevance of this distinction. On the one\nhand, Rowe is certainly right that any criticism that claims that one\nis not justified in inferring (2) unless one has additional\ninformation to the effect that unobserved \\(A\\)s are not likely\nto differ from observed \\(A\\)s with respect to the possession of\nproperty \\(B\\) entails inductive skepticism.  But, by contrast,\nit is not true that this is so if one rejects, instead, the inference\nto (1). For one might reject the latter inference on the ground that\nwhile, given any particular \\(A\\), it is likely that that\n\\(A\\) is a \\(B\\), it is not likely that all \\(A\\)s are\n\\(B\\)s. (Compare the situation with a very long conjunction: given any\nparticular conjunct, it may be likely that that conjunct is true,\nwhile being very unlikely that every conjunct, and hence the\nconjunction as a whole, is true.)\n\nThis is important, moreover, because it is (1) that Rowe needs, since\nthe conclusion that he is drawing does not concern simply the\nnext morally relevant property that someone might consider:\nconclusion Q asserts, rather, that all further\nmorally relevant properties will lack property J. Such a\nconclusion about all further cases is much stronger than a conclusion\nabout the next case, and one might well think that in some\ncircumstances a conclusion of the latter sort is justified, but that a\nconclusion of the former sort is not.\n\nOne way of supporting the latter claim is by introducing the idea of\nlogical probability, where logical probability is a measure of the\nextent to which one proposition supports another (Carnap, 1962,\n19\u201351, esp. 43\u20137), and then arguing (Tooley, 1977,\n690\u20133, and 1987, 129\u201337) that when one is dealing with an\naccidental generalization, the probability that the\nregularity in question will obtain gets closer and closer to zero,\nwithout limit, as the number of potential instances gets larger and\nlarger, and that this is so regardless of how large one\u2019s\nevidence base is. Is it impossible, then, to justify universal\ngeneralizations?  The answer is that if laws are more than mere\nregularities\u2014and, in particular, if they are second-order\nrelations between universals\u2014then the obtaining of a law, and\nthus of the corresponding regularity, may have a very high probability\nupon even quite a small body of evidence. So universal generalizations\ncan be justified, if they obtain in virtue of underlying, governing\nlaws of nature.\n\nThe question then becomes whether Q expresses a law\u2014or\na consequence of a law. If\u2014as seems plausible\u2014it does not,\nthen, although it is true that one in justified in holding, of any\ngiven, not yet observed morally relevant property, that it is unlikely\nto have property J, it may not be the case that it is\nprobable that no goodmaking (or rightmaking) property has property\nJ. It may, on the contrary, be probable that there\nis some morally relevant property that does have property\nJ.\n\nThis objection could be overcome if one could argue that it is\nunlikely that there are many unknown goodmaking properties. For if the\nnumber is small, then the probability of Q may still be high\neven if Q does not express a law, or a consequence of a\nlaw. Moreover, I am inclined to think that it may well be possible to\nargue that it is unlikely that there are many unknown, morally\nrelevant properties. But I also think that it is very likely that any\nattempt to establish this conclusion would involve some very\ncontroversial metaethical claims. As a consequence, I think that one\nis justified in concluding that such a line of argument is not\nespecially promising.\n",
