    "main_text": "Exemplification || Compresence and Partial Identity\n2.2 Compresence and Partial Identity\n\nMost philosophers, whether tacitly or overtly, appear to take\nexemplification as primitive and unanalyzable. However, on certain\nviews of particulars, it might seem that exemplification is reduced to\nsomething more fundamental.\n\nA well-known such approach is the bundle theory, which takes\nparticulars to be nothing more than \u201cbundles\u201d of\nuniversals connected by a special relation, commonly called\ncompresence, after Russell (1948: Pt. IV, ch.\n 8)[8].\n Despite well-known problems (Van Cleve 1985), this view, or\napproaches in its vicinity, keep having supporters (Casullo 1988;\nCurtis 2014; Dasgupta 2009; Paul 2002; Shiver 2014; J. Russell 2018;\nsee Sider 2020, ch. 3, for a recent critical analysis). From this\nperspective, that a particular exemplifies a property amounts to the\nproperty\u2019s being compresent with the properties that constitute\nthe bundle with which the particular in question is identified. It\nthus looks as if exemplification is reduced to compresence.\nNevertheless, compresence itself is presumably jointly exemplified by\nthe properties that constitute a given bundle, and thus at most there\nis a reduction, to compresence, of exemplification by a\nparticular (understood as a bundle), and not an elimination of\nexemplification in general.\n\nAnother, more recent, approach is based on partial identity.\nBaxter (2001) and, inspired by him, Armstrong (2004), have proposed\nrelated assays of exemplification, which seem to analyze it in terms\nof such partial identity. These views have captured some interest and\ntriggered discussions (see, e.g., Mumford 2007; Baxter\u2019s (2013)\nreply to critics and Baxter\u2019s (2018) rejoinder to Brown\n2017).\n\nBaxter (2001) relies on the notion of aspect and on the\nrelativization of numerical identity to counts. In his view,\nboth particulars and properties have aspects, which can be\nsimilar to distinct aspects of other particulars or properties. The\nnumerical identity of aspects is relative to standards for counting,\ncounts, which group items in count collections: aspects of\nparticulars in the particular collection, and aspects of\nuniversals, in the universal collection. There can then be a\ncross-count identity, which holds between an aspect in the\nparticular collection, and an aspect in the universal collection,\ne.g., the aspects Hume as human and humanity as had by\nHume. In this case, the universal and the particular in question\n(humanity and Hume, in our example) are partially identical.\nInstantiation, e.g., that Hume instantiates humanity, then amounts to\nthis partial identity of a universal and a particular. One may have\nthe feeling, as Baxter himself worries (2001: 449), that in this\napproach instantiation has been traded for something definitely more\nobscure, such as aspects and an idiosyncratic view of identity. It can\nalso be suspected that particulars\u2019 and properties\u2019\nhaving aspects is presupposed in this analysis, where this\nhaving is a relation rather close to exemplification\nitself.\n\nArmstrong (2004) tries to do without aspects. At first glance it seems\nas if he analyzes exemplification, for he takes the exemplification of\na property (a universal) by a particular to be a partial identity of\nthe property and the particular; as he puts it (2004: 47), \u201c[i]t\nis not a mere mereological overlap, as when two streets intersect, but\nit is a partial identity\u201d. However, when we see more closely\nwhat this partial identity amounts to, the suspicion arises that it\npresupposes exemplification. For Armstrong appears to identify a\nparticular via the properties that it instantiates and\nsimilarly a property via the particulars that instantiate it.\nSo that we may identify a particular, \\(x\\), via a collection of\nproperties qua instantiated by \\(x\\), say \\(\\{F_x,\\) \\(G_x,\\)\n\\(H_x,\\) \u2026, \\(P_x,\\) \\(Q_x,\\) \\(\\ldots\\};\\) and a property,\n\\(P\\), via a collection of particulars qua instantiating\n\\(P\\), say \\(\\{P_a, P_b , \\ldots ,P_x, P_y , \\ldots \\}\\). By putting\nthings in this way, we can then say that a particular is partially\nidentical to a property when the collection that identifies the\nparticular has an element in common with the collection that\nidentifies the property. To illustrate, the \\(x\\) and the \\(P\\) of our\nexample are partially identical because they have the element \\(P_x\\)\nin common. Now, the elements of these collections are neither\nproperties tout court nor particulars tout court,\nwhich led us to talk of properties qua instantiated and\nparticulars qua\n instantiating.[9]\n But this of course presupposes instantiation. Moreover, there is the\nunwelcome consequence that the world becomes dramatically less\ncontingent than we would have thought at first sight, for neither a\nconcrete particular nor a property can exist without it being the case\nthat the former has the properties it happens to have, and that the\nlatter is instantiated by the same particulars that actually\ninstantiate it; we get, as Mumford puts it (2007: 185), \u201ca major\nnew kind of necessity in the world\u201d.\n",
