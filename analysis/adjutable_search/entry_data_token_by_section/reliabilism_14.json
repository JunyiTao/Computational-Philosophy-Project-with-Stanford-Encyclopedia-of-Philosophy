    "main_text": "Cousins and Spin-offs of Reliabilism || Virtue Reliabilism\n4.2 Syntheses of Reliabilism and Evidentialism\n\nProcess reliabilism and evidentialism have long been viewed as\ncompetitors, even antitheses of one another, with one of them\n(reliabilism) being a paradigm of externalism and the other\n(evidentialism) a paradigm of internalism. However, a number of\nepistemologists have recently questioned whether these views are\nnecessarily opposed. For example, Comesa\u00f1a (2010), Goldman\n(2011), Tang (2016), Goldberg (2018), Pettigrew (2021), Miller (2019)\nand Beddor (2021) have all developed reliabilist views that\nincorporate certain elements traditionally associated with\nevidentialism.\n\nLet us start with Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s version of a hybrid view.\nComesa\u00f1a defends:\n\n\nEvidentialist Reliabilism: S\u2019s belief\nthat p is justified if and only if:\n\nS has some evidence e,\nThe belief that p is based on e, and either:\n\n\ne doesn\u2019t include any beliefs and the type,\nproducing a belief that p based on e is actually reliable,\nor\ne includes beliefs of S, all of these beliefs are\njustified, and the type producing a belief that p based on\ne is conditionally actually reliable.\n \n\n\n\nThere are a few respects in which this departs from standard versions\nof reliabilism. The most obvious is that it involves an evidential\nrequirement. This is intended to serve two functions. First, it\nis designed to help with the clairvoyance problem. One crucial feature\nof Norman\u2019s situation is that he has no evidence regarding his\nclairvoyance, or regarding the whereabouts of the President. This is\nat least one of the reasons (says Comesa\u00f1a) why we have the\nintuition that Norman is not justified. Second, Comesa\u00f1a\nsuggests that by incorporating bodies of evidence into the\nbelief-forming process, we can make headway on the generality problem.\nOn this view, the relevant type for a given belief-forming process is\nalways: producing a belief that such-and-such on the basis of body\nof evidence e.\n\nWhile incorporating the notion of evidence into a reliablist theory\ncarries potential advantages, it also raises issues of its own. As\nwe\u2019ve seen, traditional process reliabilists resisted defining\n\u201cjustification\u201d in terms of evidence because they\ndidn\u2019t want an analysis that relied on any unreduced epistemic\nnotions (Goldman 1979). Moreover, even those who do not share these\nreductive ambitions may well want some account of the notion of\nevidence possession that appears in clause 1) of Evidentialist\nReliabilism. Comesa\u00f1a suggests following Conee and Feldman\n(2004) in opting for a \u201cmentalist\u201d construal of our\nevidence, according to which our evidence ultimately consists in\nvarious mental states. While this is a start, there remains the\nquestion of which mental states constitute a subject\u2019s\nevidence. Are they conscious experiences? States that are accessible\nto consciousness? Beliefs?\n\nOne possibility\u2014not pursued directly by\nComesa\u00f1a\u2014would be to appeal to reliabilist resources to\nprovide an answer. Goldman (2011) makes a suggestion along these lines\nin developing his preferred synthesis of reliabilism and\nevidentialism. Goldman points out that while reliabilists have not\ntraditionally appealed to the notion of evidence, the notions of\nmental or psychological states play an important role in\nreliabilist theories. After all, in addition to belief-forming\nprocesses, there are also states that serve as\ninputs to those processes. These include both doxastic states\n(beliefs, primarily) and various experiences (perceptual, memorial,\netc.). Although reliabilists typically do not call these states\n\u201cevidence\u201d, there is no principled reason why they could\nnot do so. A similar suggestion is made by Beddor (2021), framed in\nterms of reasons rather than evidence. On\nBeddor\u2019s proposal, a given psychological state s\nconstitutes a prima facie reason for an agent to hold a\nbelief B just in case there is some reliable (or, in the case\nof inferential beliefs, conditionally reliable) process available to\nthe agent that is disposed to produce B when fed s as\ninput. (More on the applications of this sort of view below.) Perhaps,\nthen, not only does a reliabilist-evidentialist hybrid help address\nproblems for reliabilism, it also helps answer some pressing questions\nthat have historically faced evidentialists.\n\nA further question that arises for reliabilist-evidentialist hybrids\nconcerns the role of historical features (or the lack thereof) in the\ntheory of justifiedness. As noted in\n \u00a71\n above, traditional forms of reliabilism make the epistemic status of\na belief at a time t depend not only on features of the agent\nat t, but also on facts about how the believer acquired the\nbelief in question. Here\u2019s an example that motivates this\n\u201chistoricist\u201d dimension to traditional reliabilism\n(Goldman 1999). Last year Sally read about the health benefits of\nbroccoli in a New York Times science section story. She then forms a\njustified belief in broccoli\u2019s beneficial effects. She still\nretains that belief today but no longer recalls the evidence she had\nupon first reading the story. And she hasn\u2019t encountered any\nfurther evidence in the interim, from any kind of source. Isn\u2019t\nher belief in broccoli\u2019s beneficial effects still justified?\nPresumably this is because of her past acquisition. True, she also has\na different kind of evidence, namely, her (justified) belief that\nwhenever she seems to remember a (putative) fact it is usually true.\nBut this is not her entire evidence. It is an important determinant of\nher belief\u2019s justificatory status at t that she was\njustified in forming it originally on the basis of good evidence (of\nanother kind). Had her original belief been based on very poor\nevidence, e.g., reading a similar story in an untrustworthy news\nsource, so that the belief wasn\u2019t justified from the start, her\nbelief at time t would be unjustified\u2014or at least much\nless justified. This indicates that the evidence she acquired\noriginally still has some impact on the justificatory status\nof her belief at t.\n\nNotably, Comesa\u00f1a\u2019s Evidentalist Reliabilism lacks any\nsuch historical condition on justifiedness. However, other versions of\na hybrid theory do incorporate a historical condition, and emphasize\nit as a selling point of the view (Goldman 2011; Goldberg 2018; Beddor\n2021). For example, Goldman (2011) advocates a\n\u201ctwo-component\u201d approach to justification, which makes\nroom for a \u201cdegree of support\u201d dimension of justification\nas well as a \u201cproper causal generation\u201d dimension. Here is\none simple way of developing such a theory:\n\n\nTwo-Component Hybrid View: S\u2019s belief\nthat p is justified at t iff both:\n\nS\u2019s total evidence at t supports\nbelieving p,\nS\u2019s belief that p is the result of\na reliable belief-forming process.\n\n\n\nCondition 1\n incorporates the traditional evidentialist take on justification.\n(Though, as noted above, this condition could itself be given a\nreliabilist spin, if we characterize evidence as the inputs to\nreliable processes). By contrast,\n condition 2\n captures the causal generation dimension of justification. Goldman\nsuggests that a two-component view is nicely positioned to preserve\nthe best of both approaches.\n\nA final motivation for hybrid views is also worth noting. We saw\nearlier\n (\u00a72.4)\n that some authors have argued that reliabilists have trouble\naccounting cases of defeat \u2014 cases where an agent reliably forms\na belief that p at some initial time, and later receives\nevidence indicating that p is false. Intuitively, this further\nevidence defeats S\u2019s justification for believing\np, rendering their belief unjustified (even if it was\npreviously justified). Recently, some authors have suggested that the\nbest way of accommodating defeat in a reliabilist framework is to draw\non evidentialist elements (broadly construed). For example, Miller\n(2019) defends a version of a Two-Component Hybrid View. On her view,\ncases of defeat are cases where\n condition 1\n (the evidential support condition) is not satisfied.\n\nAnother approach to this issue is developed in Beddor (2021), who\noffers a synthesis of a reliabilist view with a \u201creasons\nfirst\u201d account of justification of the sort developed by John\nPollock (see, e.g., Pollock 1987, 1995). On Pollock\u2019s view, a\nbelief is justified as long as it is based on a chain of undefeated\nreasons that support it. One distinctive feature of Pollock\u2019s\nframework is that he goes on to define defeaters in terms of reasons:\na defeater for a belief B is a prima facie reason to\nbelieve that B is false (rebutting defeater) or a prima\nfacie reason to believe that the agent\u2019s beliefs do not\nsupport B (undercutting defeater). Beddor suggests that by\nsupplementing this account with a reliabilist analysis of prima\nfacie reasons (of the sort sketched above), we get a view that is\nfaithful to the main motivations for reliabilism, while also providing\na more satisfactory treatment of defeat.\n\nThus there are a number of different ways of developing a hybrid of\nreliabilism and evidentialism. Such hybrids hold considerable promise\nfor overcoming some of the problems facing both reliabilism and\nevidentialism. In view of this promise, such hybrids are a potentially\nfruitful area for further research.\n",
