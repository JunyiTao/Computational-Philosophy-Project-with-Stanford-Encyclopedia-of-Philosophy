    "main_text": "The Later Theory of Religion\n7. The Naturalization of Ethics in Feuerbach\u2019s Last Writings\n\nAs noted in the preceding section, Feuerbach\u2019s espousal of\nsensuousness coincides with a movement toward nominalism that is\nreflected in a shift of emphasis from the human species to the\nindividual human being in his later works on religion. One way that\nthis shift shows itself is in a striking change in Feuerbach\u2019s\nestimation of egoism. Among the many issues that remain unclear in\nFeuerbach\u2019s later writings is what the expression \u201chuman\nessence\u201d can mean for him once he has abandoned the\nspecies-ontology of his earlier writings and declared himself a\nnominalist. That pivotal question aside, it is at least clear that in\nPrinciples, and in his later writings on ethics, Feuerbach\ncontinues to emphasize the importance of inter-subjectivity and of the\nI-Thou relationship. However, these are no longer conceived in\nidealistic terms, as they had been previously, including\nFeuerbach\u2019s doctoral dissertation, where he had spoken of\nthought as a species-activity in which the individual thinking subject\nparticipates. In his later writings on ethics, Feuerbach continues to\naffirm that human beings are essentially communal and dialogical\nbeings, both with respect to our cognitive and linguistic capacities,\nand with respect to the range of moral sentiments we experience toward\none another, but the communality in which the human essence is\nmanifested is now said to be one that presupposes a real,\n\u201csensible\u201d distinction between I and Thou.\n\nUndoubtedly, the central concept in Feuerbach\u2019s last works,\nwhich include the essay, \u201cOn Spiritualism and Materialism,\nEspecially in Relation to the Freedom of the Will\u201d, as well as\nan incomplete essay on ethics, is the concept of the\nGl\u00fcckseligkeitstrieb or drive-to-happiness. Toward the\nend of the Preliminary Theses, after affirming that all\nscience must be grounded in nature, and that doctrines not so grounded\nremain purely \u201chypothetical\u201d, Feuerbach had gone on to\nnote that this is especially true of the doctrine of freedom, and he\nhad assigned to the new philosophy the task of \u201cnaturalizing\nfreedom\u201d (VT 262/172). This is one of the tasks to\nwhich he applies himself in \u201cOn Spiritualism and\nMaterialism\u201d, where he takes aim at\n\u201csupernaturalistic\u201d philosophers, among whom he counts\nKant, Fichte and Hegel, who ascribe to human beings a noumenal or\nuniversal will that is \u201cindependent of all natural laws and\nnatural causes and thus of all sensuous motivations\n[Triebfedern]\u201d (SM 54). In arguing that it is\npossible for the will to be determined by the mere form of the moral\nlaw, independently of any sensible inclination, Kant had identified\nthe will with pure practical reason. In doing so, Feuerbach argues, he\nturned the will into a mere abstraction. For Feuerbach, it makes no\nsense to speak of a timeless will devoid of a volitional impulse\ndirected toward some particular object.\n\nThe concepts of drive (Trieb), happiness, sensation and will\nare closely interrelated in the account of agency that Feuerbach seeks\nto develop in these last writings. Feuerbach regards sensation as the\n\u201cfirst condition of willing\u201d (M 366), since\nwithout sensation there is no pain or need or sense of lack against\nwhich for the will to strive to assert itself. At one point, he\ndefines happiness as the \u201chealthy, normal\u201d state of\ncontentment or wellbeing experienced by an organism that is able to\nsatisfy the needs and drives that are constitutive of its\n\u201cindividual, characteristic nature and life\u201d (M\n366). The drive-to-happiness is a drive toward the overcoming of a\nmultitude of painful limitations by which the finite, corporeal\nsubject is afflicted. These can include social conditions involving\n\u201cpolitical brutality and despotism\u201d (VWR 61/50).\nEvery particular drive is a manifestation of the drive-to-happiness,\nand the different individual drives are named after the different\nobjects in which people seek their happiness (SM 70). Among\nthe specific drives to which Feuerbach refers in his later writings\nare the drive-to-self-preservation, the sexual drive, the\ndrive-to-enjoyment, the drive-to-activity and the drive-to-knowledge.\nAlthough he does not explicitly associate drives with the unconscious,\nFeuerbach does anticipate Nietzsche and Freud in regarding the body as\nthe \u201cground\u201d of both the will and of consciousness\n(SM 153), and he emphasizes that action results from the\nforce with which a dominant drive succeeds in subduing other\nconflicting drives that may reassert themselves under altered\ncircumstances (SM 91). Feuerbach also occasionally\ndistinguishes between healthy and unhealthy drives, though he has\nlittle to say about the standard or criterion he uses for making such\na distinction.\n\nWhereas happiness involves the experience of a sense of contentment on\nthe part of a being that is able to satisfy the drives that are\ncharacteristic of its nature, the inability to satisfy these drives\nresults in various forms of discontent, aggravation, pain and\nfrustration. The German word, \u201cWiderwille\u201d, means\ndisgust or repugnance, but literally it involves not-wanting or,\netymologically, \u201cwilling against\u201d, and this, Feuerbach\ncontends, is the most rudimentary form of willing.\n\n\nEvery malady (\u00dcbel), every unsatisfied drive, every\nunassuaged longing, every sense of absence [i.e., of a desired object]\nis an irritating or stimulating injury and negation of the\ndrive-to-happiness innate in each living and sensing being, and the\ncountervailing affirmation of the drive-to-happiness, accompanied by\nrepresentations and consciousness, is what we call \u201cwill\u201d.\n(M 367)\n\n\nFreedom of the will, as Feuerbach conceives of it here, is freedom\nfrom the evils (\u00dcbeln) by which my drive-to-happiness is\nrestricted, and is contingent upon the availability to me of the\nspecific means required for overcoming these restrictions.\n\nAnother way that Feuerbach seeks to \u201cnaturalize freedom\u201d\nis by developing a naturalistic account of conscience according to\nwhich the voice of conscience, which imposes restrictions on my own\ndrive-to-happiness, functions in doing so as the advocate for the\ndrive-to-happiness of \u201cthe I apart from me, the sensuous\nThou\u201d (SM 80), who has been or stands to be harmed by\nthose actions from which I can have a moral obligation to refrain from\nperforming. Where there is no harm or benefit, Feuerbach contends,\nthere is no criterion for distinguishing right from wrong (SM\n75\u201376). Feuerbach agrees with Schopenhauer in regarding\ncompassion (Mitleid) as a basic source of moral motivation,\nbut rejects Schopenhauer\u2019s association of compassion with the\nrenunciation of the will to live. The purpose of morality and law is\nto harmonize the drive-to-happiness of the various individual members\nof a moral community.\n\n\nMy right is the legal recognition of my own drive-to-happiness, my\nduty is the drive-to-happiness of the other that demands recognition\nfrom me. (SM 74)\n\n\nThe moral will, as Feuerbach conceives of it here, is not a\ndisinterested will. It is rather \u201cthat will which seeks to cause\nno harm because it wishes to suffer no harm\u201d (SM 80),\nand has come to identify its own interests with those of others.\nBecause sympathy for the suffering of others presupposes antipathy\ntoward my own suffering, whoever does away with self-interest (i.e.,\nrefuses to recognize moral value in actions motivated by\nself-interest) does away at the same time with compassion\n(Mitleid).\n",
