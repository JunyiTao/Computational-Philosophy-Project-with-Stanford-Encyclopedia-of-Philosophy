    "main_text": "Four Arguments for the Faithfulness of Pure Wave Mechanics || A typical relative sequence of measurement records exhibits the standard quantum statistics\n5.4 A typical relative sequence of measurement records exhibits the standard quantum statistics\n\nEverett did not solve the probability problem by finding probabilities\nin pure wave mechanics. Rather, he repeatedly insisted that there were\nno probabilities and took this to be an essential feature of the\ntheory. What he did, rather, was to show that a typical relative\nsequence of a modeled observer\u2019s measurement records will\nexhibit the standard quantum statistics.\n\nAs we saw above, Everett got this result in two steps. First, he found\na suitable measure of typicality over relative states \\(m\\) whose\nvalue is fully determined by the model of pure wave mechanics. Then he\nshowed that, in the limit as the number of measurement interactions\ngets large, almost all relative sequences of measurement records, in\nthe sense of almost all given by \\(m\\), will exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics. While the typicality measure \\(m\\) is\nacross branches, he explained the subjective appearance of\nquantum probabilities by the sequence of records within a typical\nbranch.\n\nEverett summarized his strategy and main result to a group a\nphysicists at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics at\nXavier University in October of 1962:\n\nNow, I would like to assert that, for a \u201ctypical\u201d branch,\nthe frequency of results will be precisely what is predicted by\nordinary quantum mechanics. Even more strongly, I would like to assert\nthat, as the number of observations goes to infinity, almost all\nbranches will contain frequencies of results in accord with ordinary\nquantum theory predictions. To be able to make a statement like this\nrequires that there be some sort of a measure on the superposition of\nstates. What I need, therefore, is a measure that I can put on a sum\nof orthogonal states. There is one consistency [criterion] which would\nbe required for such a thing. Since my states are constantly\nbranching, I must insist that the measure on a state originally is\nequal to the sum of the measures on the separate branches after a\nbranching process. Now this consistency criterion can be shown to lead\ndirectly to the squared amplitude of the coefficient, as the unique\nmeasure which satisfies this. With this unique measure, deduced only\nfrom a consistency condition, I can then assert: indeed, for almost\nall (in the measure theoretical sense) elements of a very large\nsuperposition, the predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics hold.\n(Barrett and Byrne 2012, 274\u201375)\n\n\nImportantly, it is usually not the case that most relative sequences\nby count will exhibit the standard quantum statistics. This\nis why the norm squared coefficient measure \\(m\\) is essential to\nEverett\u2019s account.\n\nRegarding Everett\u2019s summary of his project, there are two\nclosely related points worth noting. First, his sub-branch additivity\ncondition is not required for simple consistency. This can be seen by\nthe fact that a proportional counting measure over descendent branches\nwould have been perfectly consistent. It just wouldn\u2019t have\nentailed that a typical branch will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics. Second, as he acknowledged in this thesis, he needed more\nthan just sub-branch additivity to get the squared amplitude measure\n\\(m\\). He also needed \\(m\\) to be a positive linear function of the\ncomplex-valued coefficients associated with each branch, and he needed\nto suppose that \\(m\\) satisfied the standard axioms for being a\nprobability measure. See Everett (1956, 120\u201330) and (1957,\n186\u201394) and Barrett (2017) and (2020) for discussions of\ntypicality and quantum statistics in pure wave mechanics.\n\nIt is an immediate consequence of Everett\u2019s deduction that that\nif one were to further assume that one should expect one\u2019s\nrecords to be typical in the sense provided by measure \\(m\\), then one\nshould expect one\u2019s records to exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics. Were such an assumption added to his formulation of pure\nwave mechanics, something that Everett himself never proposed, then\none would be able to explain why one should expect to find\noneself at each time with records that appear to have been generated\nby a random process like rule 4b. But one cannot get even this, let\nalone standard forward-looking quantum probabilities, without\nsupplementing pure wave mechanics with auxiliary assumptions that tie\nthe measure \\(m\\) to one\u2019s probabilistic expectations. Such\nauxiliary assumptions would clearly represent significant additions to\npure wave mechanics.\n\nFor his part, Everett just argued that the sequence of records in a\ntypical branch, in his specified sense of typical, would satisfy the\nstandard quantum statistics. And it was this that he took to establish\nthat his relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics was\nempirically faithful and hence empirically acceptable.\n",
