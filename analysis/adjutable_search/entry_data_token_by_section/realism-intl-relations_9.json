    "main_text": "Neorealism || Objections to Neorealism\n4. Conclusion: The Cautionary and Changing Character of Realism\n\nAn unintended and unfortunate consequence of the debate about\nneorealism is that neorealism and a large part of its critique (with\nthe notable exception of the English School) has been expressed in\nabstract scientific and philosophical terms. This has made the theory\nof international politics almost inaccessible to a layperson and has\ndivided the discipline of international relations into incompatible\nparts. Whereas classical realism was a theory aimed at supporting\ndiplomatic practice and providing a guide to be followed by those\nseeking to understand and deal with potential threats, today\u2019s\ntheories, concerned with various grand pictures and projects, are\nill-suited to perform this task. This is perhaps the main reason why\nthere has been a renewed interest in classical realism, and\nparticularly in the ideas of Morgenthau. Rather than being seen as an\nobsolete form of pre-scientific realist thought, superseded by\nneorealist theory, his thinking is now considered to be more complex\nand of greater contemporary relevance than was earlier recognized\n(Williams 2007, 1\u20139). It fits uneasily in the orthodox picture\nof realism he is usually associated with. \n\nIn recent years, scholars have questioned prevailing narratives about\nclear theoretical traditions in the discipline of international\nrelations. Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes and other thinkers have\nbecome subject to re-examination as a means of challenging prevailing\nuses of their legacies in the discipline and exploring other lineages\nand orientations. Morgenthau has undergone a similar process of\nreinterpretation. A number of scholars (Hartmut Behr, Muriel Cozette,\nAmelia Heath, Sean Molloy) have endorsed the importance of his thought\nas a source of change for the standard interpretation of realism.\nMurielle Cozette stresses Morgenthau\u2019s critical dimension of\nrealism expressed in his commitment to \u201cspeak truth to\npower\u201d and to \u201cunmask power\u2019s claims to truth and\nmorality,\u201d and in his tendency to assert different claims at\ndifferent times (Cozette 10\u201312). She writes: \u201cThe\nprotection of human life and freedom are given central importance by\nMorgenthau, and constitute a \u2018transcendent standard of\nethics\u2019 which should always animate scientific enquiries\u201d\n(19). This shows the flexibility of his classical realism and reveals\nhis normative assumptions based on the promotion of universal moral\nvalues. While Morgenthau assumes that states are power-oriented\nactors, he at the same time acknowledges that international politics\nwould be more pernicious than it actually is were it not for moral\nrestraints and the work of international law(Behr and Heath 333). \n\nAnother avenue for the development of a realist theory of\ninternational relations is offered by Robert Gilpin\u2019s seminal\nwork War and Change in World Politics. If this work were to\ngain greater prominence in IR scholarship, instead of engaging in\nfruitless theoretical debates, we would be better prepared today\n\u201cfor rapid power shifts and geopolitical change\n\u201d(Wohlforth, 2011 505). We would be able to explain the causes\nof great wars and long periods of peace, and the creation and waning\nof international orders. Still another avenue is provided by the\napplication of the new scientific discoveries to social sciences. The\nevidence for this is, for example, the recent work of Alexander Wendt,\nQuantum Mind and Social Science. A new realist approach to\ninternational politics could be based on the organic and holistic\nworld view emerging from quantum theory, the idea of human evolution,\nand the growing awareness of the role of human beings in the\nevolutionary process (Korab-Karpowicz 2017). \n\nRealism is thus more than a static, amoral theory, and cannot be\naccommodated solely within a positivist interpretation of\ninternational relations. It is a practical and evolving theory that\ndepends on the actual historical and political conditions, and is\nultimately judged by its ethical standards and by its relevance in\nmaking prudent political decisions (Morgenthau 1962). In place of the\ntwentieth-century Cold War ideological rivalry, the main competition\nin the twenty-first-century is between the ideologies justifying the\nexpansion of the US-dominated unipolar world and those supporting the\nreestablishment of a multipolar one (M\u00fcllerson 2017).\nConsequently, the growing tensions among superpowers have contributed\nto the revival of the idealist-realist debate and have caused a\nresurgence of interest in realism. John Mearsheimer is an important\nthinker in this respect, known for his pessimistic concept of\noffensive realism, which assumes that powerful states, such as the\nUnited States, would aim at the maximization of power and domination\nover others (Mearsheimer 2001). His late work, The Liberal\nDelusion (Mearsheimer 2019), in which he presents realist\narguments against a liberal position, can already be considered a\nclassic of the theory of international relations. \n\nAs the current revival of interest proves, realism is a theory for\ndifficult times, when security becomes a real issue. This happens when\ncountries face the danger of an armed conflict. In such situations,\nrealism performs a useful cautionary role. It warns us against\nprogressivism, moralism, legalism and other orientations that lose\ntouch with the reality of self-interest and power. It is a necessary\ncorrective to an overoptimistic liberal belief in international\ncooperation and change resulting from interdependence, as well as to a\ncritical theory claim that our insecurity is merely a result of\nsecuritization.\n\nNevertheless, when it becomes a dogmatic enterprise, by focusing on\nconflict alone, realism fails to perform its proper function as a\ntheory of international relations. By remaining stuck in a\nstate-centric and excessively simplified \u201cparadigm\u201d such\nas neorealism and by denying the possibility of any progress in\ninterstate relations, it turns into an ideology. Its emphasis on power\npolitics and national interest can be misused to justify aggression.\nIt has therefore to be supplanted by theories that take better account\nof the dramatically changing picture of global politics. To its merely\nnegative, cautionary function, positive norms must be added. These\nnorms extend from the rationality and prudence stressed by classical\nrealists; through the vision of multilateralism, international law,\nand an international society emphasized by liberals and members of the\nEnglish School; to the cosmopolitanism and global solidarity advocated\nby many of today\u2019s writers.\n",
