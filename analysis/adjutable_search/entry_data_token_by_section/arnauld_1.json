Arnauld on the Distinction between Philosophy and Theology\n\nArnauld considered it important to be clear about the distinction\nbetween philosophy and theology. This concern is present in his work\nfrom the beginning, in 1641, to the end of his published writings.\nThus, he divides the \u201cFourth Objections\u201d to\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations into \u201cthe possible\nphilosophical objections regarding the major issues of the nature of\nour mind and of God\u201d and \u201cthe problems which a theologian\nmight come up against in the work as a whole\u201d\n(Descartes, 2:169). One of Arnauld\u2019s criticisms of\nMalebranche is that he does not establish many of the principles in\nhis system of nature and grace either by the proper methods of\nphilosophy or of theology. Again, in R\u00e8gles du bon\nsens, written the year before his death, Arnauld warns,\n\nBe very careful about the nature of the question in dispute, whether\nit is philosophical or theological. For if it is theological, it must\nbe decided principally by authority, whereas if it is philosophical,\nit must be decided principally by\n reason.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Arnauld, the chief purpose of theology is to defend the\ntruths revealed by God through Sacred Scripture and the teaching\ntradition of the Church. Part of the ceremony in which he received the\ndoctorate in theology from the Sorbonne was a vow, made before the\naltar of the Holy Martyrs, \u201cthat we will give our life before\nleaving the truth undefended.\u201d In the speech he gave on that\noccasion, Arnauld emphasized the vow, which he said was instituted\nbecause\n\nthe obligation to defend the truth with force and courage is so\nindispensable in a theologian that those whose courage in this regard\ncould weaken, should be committed to it by the holiness and piety of a\nsolemn public vow (Traduction du Discours latin prononc\u00e9\npar M. Arnauld en recevant le Bonnet de Docteur, OA, 43:12).\n\n\nThis intense religious commitment to his role as a theologian\ncontinued throughout his life. Combined with his combative\npersonality, it helps to explain the passion with which he defended\nindividual theologians, especially Saint-Cyran and Jansen, as well as\nwhat he took to be the truths of revelation.\n\nRegarding philosophy, Arnauld, like Descartes, held that its purpose\nwas to acquire useful knowledge through reason. That reason ought to\nbe employed only in the pursuit of useful knowledge is emphasized in\nthe opening pages of the Logic. Arnauld and Nicole say that\n\u201cspeculative sciences, such as geometry, astronomy, and\nphysics\u201d can be used as instruments for perfecting judgment and\nreason. This provides a use for some of the \u201cnooks and\ncrannies\u201d of those sciences, which would otherwise be\n\u201ccompletely worthless.\u201d They go on to say,\n\nPeople are not born to spend their time measuring lines, examining the\nrelations between angles, or contemplating different motions of\nmatter. The mind is too large, life too short, time too precious to\noccupy oneself with such trivial objects. But they are obligated to be\njust, fair, and judicious in all their speech, their actions, and the\nbusiness they conduct. Above all they ought to train and educate\nthemselves for this (Logic, 5).\n\n\nArnauld did not think, however, that philosophical sciences are useful\nonly as instruments for acquiring virtues. Natural philosophy or\nphysics can be made to serve the good of human life in many ways and\neven metaphysics is useful in that it can help the theologian in the\ntask of defending the truth.\n\nAn outstanding example of that sort of usefulness, in Arnauld\u2019s\nview, was Descartes\u2019 argument for the distinction of the soul or\nmind from the body. Arnauld refers to Descartes as a \u201cChristian\nphilosopher,\u201d echoing Descartes\u2019 own use of the phrase in\nthe letter dedicating the Meditations on First Philosophy to\nthe Faculty of Theology of the Sorbonne, where Descartes says that he\ncarried out the injunction of the Fourth Lateran Council\n(1512\u201317) that \u201cChristian philosophers\u201d should try\nto prove the immateriality of the soul (Descartes, 2:4).\n\nThe authorities most often cited by Arnauld are Augustine and Aquinas\nin theology, and Augustine, Aquinas, and Descartes in philosophy.\nArnauld\u2019s attitude toward these predecessors is complex. From\nthe outset of his published work in philosophy, he claimed that\nAugustinian themes were present in Descartes. However, in his late\nwork, beginning with On True and False Ideas in 1683, he\nbegan to cite Aquinas frequently, as well as Augustine, both in\nphilosophy and theology. Thus, in the 181 folio pages of\nIdeas, which Arnauld describes as dealing with a purely\nphilosophical topic, he cites Augustine twenty times and Aquinas six\ntimes, always claiming that they agree with Descartes and with his own\nposition. Similarly, in the theological part of\nR\u00e9flexions, Arnauld relies heavily on Aquinas\u2019s\nChristology while arguing that Malebranche\u2019s theodicy leads him\ninto heterodox, if not downright heretical, positions (OA\n39:777). Again, in his late work on the problem of human free will and\ngr\u00e2ce efficace par elle-m\u00eame, Arnauld took over\nwhat he says is the Thomistic position that the will is free when it\nis a potestas ou facultas ad opposita. And in the controversy\nwith Nicole and others over Nicole\u2019s theory of a gr\u00e2ce\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Arnauld relied heavily on Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of cognition. So frequently did Arnauld rely on Thomistic\nformulations in his late work that his friends reproached him for\n\u201cabandoning Augustine in order to follow Aquinas, thus\npreferring the disciple to the master\u201d (R\u00e8gles du bon\nsens, OA, 10:154). This reproach had to do directly with\nArnauld\u2019s rejection of the \u201cPlatonism\u201d in Augustine\nand Jansen. But as shown below, Arnauld, late in his career, also\nparted company with Augustine and Jansen on the nature of human free\nwill, and with Jansen\u2019s account of the nature of actual\ngrace.\n\nArnauld had a scholarly knowledge of the history of philosophy and\ntheology, and was certainly aware of the important differences among\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Descartes on such issues as the role of sense\nperception in human knowledge, the relation of the mind to the body,\nand the nature of human freedom. But Arnauld wanted to emphasize the\ncontinuity of Descartes with the Christian past. Arnauld feared that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy would be made into a weapon against the\nChristian tradition. Emphasizing those elements in Descartes\u2019\nphilosophy that are in continuity with Augustine and Aquinas was part\nof Arnauld\u2019s effort to make of Cartesianism an ally, rather than\nan enemy, of the faith.\n",
