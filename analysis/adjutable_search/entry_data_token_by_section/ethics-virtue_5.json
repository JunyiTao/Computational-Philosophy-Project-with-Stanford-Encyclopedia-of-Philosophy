    "main_text": "Forms of Virtue Ethics || Agent-Based and Exemplarist Virtue Ethics\n2.2 Agent-Based and Exemplarist Virtue Ethics\n\nRather than deriving the normativity of virtue from the value of\neudaimonia, agent-based virtue ethicists argue that other\nforms of normativity\u2014including the value of\neudaimonia\u2014are traced back to and ultimately explained\nin terms of the motivational and dispositional qualities of\nagents.\n\nIt is unclear how many other forms of normativity must be explained in\nterms of the qualities of agents in order for a theory to count as\nagent-based. The two best-known agent-based theorists, Michael Slote\nand Linda Zagzebski, trace a wide range of normative qualities back to\nthe qualities of agents. For example, Slote defines rightness and\nwrongness in terms of agents\u2019 motivations: \u201c[A]gent-based\nvirtue ethics \u2026 understands rightness in terms of good\nmotivations and wrongness in terms of the having of bad (or\ninsufficiently good) motives\u201d (2001: 14). Similarly, he explains\nthe goodness of an action, the value of eudaimonia, the\njustice of a law or social institution, and the normativity of\npractical rationality in terms of the motivational and dispositional\nqualities of agents (2001: 99\u2013100, 154, 2000). Zagzebski\nlikewise defines right and wrong actions by reference to the emotions,\nmotives, and dispositions of virtuous and vicious agents. For example,\n\u201cA wrong act = an act that the phronimos\ncharacteristically would not do, and he would feel guilty if he did =\nan act such that it is not the case that he might do it = an act that\nexpresses a vice = an act that is against a requirement of virtue (the\nvirtuous self)\u201d (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Her definitions of\nduties, good and bad ends, and good and bad states of affairs are\nsimilarly grounded in the motivational and dispositional states of\nexemplary agents (1998, 2004, 2010).\n\nHowever, there could also be less ambitious agent-based approaches to\nvirtue ethics (see Slote 1997). At the very least, an agent-based\napproach must be committed to explaining what one should do by\nreference to the motivational and dispositional states of agents. But\nthis is not yet a sufficient condition for counting as an agent-based\napproach, since the same condition will be met by every\nvirtue ethical account. For a theory to count as an agent-based form\nof virtue ethics it must also be the case that the normative\nproperties of motivations and dispositions cannot be explained in\nterms of the normative properties of something else (such as\neudaimonia or states of affairs) which is taken to be more\nfundamental.\n\nBeyond this basic commitment, there is room for agent-based theories\nto be developed in a number of different directions. The most\nimportant distinguishing factor has to do with how motivations and\ndispositions are taken to matter for the purposes of explaining other\nnormative qualities. For Slote what matters are this particular\nagent\u2019s actual motives and dispositions. The goodness of\naction A, for example, is derived from the agent\u2019s motives when\nshe performs A. If those motives are good then the action is good, if\nnot then not. On Zagzebski\u2019s account, by contrast, a good or\nbad, right or wrong action is defined not by this agent\u2019s actual\nmotives but rather by whether this is the sort of action a virtuously\nmotivated agent would perform (Zagzebski 2004: 160). Appeal to the\nvirtuous agent\u2019s hypothetical motives and dispositions\nenables Zagzebski to distinguish between performing the right action\nand doing so for the right reasons (a distinction that, as Brady\n(2004) observes, Slote has trouble drawing).\n\nAnother point on which agent-based forms of virtue ethics might differ\nconcerns how one identifies virtuous motivations and dispositions.\nAccording to Zagzebski\u2019s exemplarist account, \u201cWe do not\nhave criteria for goodness in advance of identifying the exemplars of\ngoodness\u201d (Zagzebski 2004: 41). As we observe the people around\nus, we find ourselves wanting to be like some of them (in at least\nsome respects) and not wanting to be like others. The former provide\nus with positive exemplars and the latter with negative ones. Our\nunderstanding of better and worse motivations and virtuous and vicious\ndispositions is grounded in these primitive responses to exemplars\n(2004: 53). This is not to say that every time we act we stop and ask\nourselves what one of our exemplars would do in this situations. Our\nmoral concepts become more refined over time as we encounter a wider\nvariety of exemplars and begin to draw systematic connections between\nthem, noting what they have in common, how they differ, and which of\nthese commonalities and differences matter, morally speaking.\nRecognizable motivational profiles emerge and come to be labeled as\nvirtues or vices, and these, in turn, shape our understanding of the\nobligations we have and the ends we should pursue. However, even\nthough the systematising of moral thought can travel a long way from\nour starting point, according to the exemplarist it never reaches a\nstage where reference to exemplars is replaced by the recognition of\nsomething more fundamental. At the end of the day, according to the\nexemplarist, our moral system still rests on our basic propensity to\ntake a liking (or disliking) to exemplars. Nevertheless, one could be\nan agent-based theorist without advancing the exemplarist\u2019s\naccount of the origins or reference conditions for judgments of good\nand bad, virtuous and vicious.\n",
