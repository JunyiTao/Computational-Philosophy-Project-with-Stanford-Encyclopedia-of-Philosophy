    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Positive Ethical Vision\n2. Nietzsche\u2019s Positive Ethical Vision\n\nWhile Nietzsche clearly has views about the states of affairs to which\npositive intrinsic value attaches (namely, the flourishing of\nhigher men), there is more disagreement among interpreters about what\nkind of ethics arises from the latter valuation so central to his\ncritique of morality. The two leading candidates are that Nietzsche\nembraces a kind of virtue ethics (e.g., Hunt 1991, Swanton\n2005) and that he is a kind of perfectionist (Hurka 1993, Hurka 2007).\nThese accounts turn out to overlap \u2014 the perfections of\nthe latter account are often the virtues of the former\n\u2014 though the perfectionist account will prove to have certain\nother advantages, discussed below.\n\nAny account of Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cpositive ethics\u201d\nconfronts a threshold worry, namely, that Nietzsche\u2019s\nnaturalistic conception of persons and agency \u2014 and, in\nparticular, his conception of persons as constituted by non-conscious\ntype-facts that determine their actions \u2014 makes it unclear how\nNietzsche could have a philosophical ethics in any conventional sense.\nIf, as Nietzsche, says, we face \u201ca brazen wall of fate; we\nare in prison, we can only dream ourselves free, not\nmake ourselves free\u201d (HAH II:33); if \u201cthe single human\nbeing is a piece of fatum from the front and from the rear,\none law more, one necessity more for all that is yet to come and to\nbe\u201d (TI V:6); if (as he says more hyperbolically in\nNachlass material) \u201cthe voluntary is absolutely\nlacking\u2026everything has been directed along certain lines from\nthe beginning\u201d (WP 458); if (again hyperbolically) \u201cone\nwill become only that which one is (in spite of all: that means\neducation, instruction, milieu, chance, and accident)\u201d (WP 334);\nthen it is hardly surprising that Nietzsche should also say, \u201cA\nman as he ought to be: that sounds to us as insipid as\n\u2018a tree as he ought to be\u2019\u201d (WP 332).\n\nYet a philosopher reluctant to talk about \u201cman as he\nought to be\u201d is plainly ill-suited to the task of\ndeveloping a normative ethics, understood as systematic and\ntheoretical guidance for how to live, whether that guidance comes in\nthe form of rules for behavior or dispositions of character to be\ncultivated. (There is an additional, and special difficulty, for those\nwho think Nietzsche is a virtue ethicist, namely, that he also thinks\ngenuine virtues are specific to individuals, meaning that there will\nbe nothing general for the theorist to say about them [see,\ne.g., Z I:5].) This means we must approach the question of\nNietzsche\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d ethics in terms of\nexplicating (1) what it is Nietzsche values, (2) what his criteria of\nevaluation are, and (3) what evaluative structure, if any, is\nexhibited by the answers to (1) and (2). We go wrong at the start,\nhowever, if we expect Nietzsche to produce a normative theory of any\nfamiliar kind, whether a virtue ethics or otherwise.\n\nImportantly, the preceding points should not be read as denying that\nNietzsche thinks values and evaluative judgments can have a\ncausal impact on actions and how lives are lived. After all,\nthere would be no point in undertaking a \u201crevaluation of\nvalues\u201d if such a revaluation would not have consequences for,\ne.g., the flourishing of higher men, or if MPS values did not have\ndeleterious causal consequences for those same people. Values make a\ncausal difference, but, given Nietzsche\u2019s epiphenomenalism about\nconsciousness (discussed, above, in 1.1), they do not make this\ndifference because of free, conscious choices individuals make to\nadopt certain moral rules or cultivate certain dispositions of\ncharacter.\n\nWe can better appreciate Nietzsche\u2019s unusual views on this score\nby looking more closely at the popular, but mistaken, idea that\nNietzsche calls on people to \u201ccreate themselves\u201d (on the\ngeneral topic, see Leiter 1998). Alexander Nehamas, for example, reads\nNietzsche as endorsing an ethics of self-creation. For Nietzsche,\nNehamas says, \u201cThe people who \u2018want to become those they\nare\u2019 are precisely \u2018human beings who are new, unique,\nincomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves\u2019\n(GS, 335)\u201d (1985, p. 174). Nehamas, however, truncates the quote\nfrom The Gay Science at a misleading point. For Nietzsche, in\nthe full passage, continues as follows:\n\nTo that end [of creating ourselves] we must become the best learners\nand discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the\nworld: we must become physicists in order to be\ncreators in this sense [wir m\u00fcssen Physiker sein,\num, in jenem Sinne, Sch\u00f6pfer sein zu k\u00f6nnen]\n\u2014 while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on\nignorance of physics \u2026 . Therefore: long live physics!\n(GS 335)\n\n\nCreation \u201cin this sense\u201d is, then, a very special sense\nindeed: for it presupposes the discovery of what is \u201clawful and\nnecessary\u201d as revealed by physical science. The passage begins\nto make more sense in context. For in this same section, Nietzsche\nclaims that \u201cevery action is unknowable,\u201d though he\nadds:\n\n\u2026our opinions, valuations, and tables of what is good certainly\nbelong among the most powerful levers in the involved mechanism of our\nactions, but\u2026in any particular case the law of their mechanism\nis indemonstrable [unnachweisbar].\n\n\nThis observation leads Nietzsche immediately to the suggestion that we\nshould create \u201cour own new tables of what is good,\u201d\npresumably with an eye to effecting the causal determination of our\nactions in new ways. However, we need help from science to identify\nthe lawful patterns into which values and actions fall; even if the\nmechanisms are indemonstrable, science may at least reveal the\npatterns of value-inputs and action-outputs. So to create one\u2019s\nself, \u201cin this sense,\u201d is to accept Nietzsche\u2019s\nbasically deterministic picture of action \u2014 as determined by\nsub-conscious causes (type-facts) that are hard to identify \u2014\nbut to use science to help identify those \u201cvalues\u201d which\nfigure in the causal determination of action in new, but predictable,\nways.\n\nValues, then, have a causal impact upon how people act and thus also\non their life trajectories; but we cannot expect these impacts to flow\nfrom free, conscious choices that persons make. This would explain, of\ncourse, why we find so little in Nietzsche by way of argumentative or\ndiscursive support for his evaluative judgments: such intellectual\ndevices are precisely the ones that would appeal to our conscious\nfaculties, and thus would be idle with respect to the desired\noutcomes. Nietzsche\u2019s often violent rhetorical style, by\ncontrast, might be expected (or so Nietzsche presumably thinks) to\nhave the requisite non-rational effect on his desired readers \u2014\nthose \u201cwhose ears are related to ours\u201d (GS 381). (More on\nthis issue in Section 4, below.)\n\nIf Nietzsche does not have a typical normative ethics, he certainly\nhas no shortage of views about evaluative questions. For example, it\nis clear from the earlier discussion of Nietzsche\u2019s critique of\nmorality that he assigns great intrinsic value to the flourishing of\nhigher men. But who are these \u201chigher men\u201d and why does\nNietzsche assign value to them? (Note that while Nietzsche speaks in\nThus Spoke Zarathustra of the \u201csuperman\u201d as a\nkind of ideal higher type, this concept simply drops out of his mature\nwork (except for a brief mention in EH in the context of discussing\nZarathustra). \u201cHigher men\u201d is an important\nconcept in Nietzsche; the \u201csuperman\u201d is nothing more than\na rhetorical trope in the highly stylized Zarathustra.)\n\nNietzsche has three favorite examples of \u201chigher\u201d human\nbeings: Goethe, Beethoven, and Nietzsche himself! What makes these\nfigures paradigms of the \u201chigher\u201d type for Nietzsche,\nbeyond their great creativity (as he says, \u201cthe men of great\ncreativity\u201d are \u201cthe really great men according to my\nunderstanding\u201d (WP 957))? Following Leiter (2002: 116\u2013122;\nLeiter 2015: 92\u2013100), we can identify five characteristics that\nNietzsche identifies as distinctive of \u201chigher men\u201d: the\nhigher type is solitary, pursues a \u201cunifying project,\u201d is\nhealthy, is life-affirming, and practices self-reverence. Taken\ntogether, they are plainly sufficient to make someone a higher type in\nNietzsche\u2019s view, though it is not obvious that any one of these\nis necessary, and various combinations often seem sufficient for\nexplaining how Nietzsche speaks of higher human beings.\n\nFirst, higher types are solitary and deal with others only\ninstrumentally. \u201cEvery choice human being,\u201d says\nNietzsche, \u201cstrives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy\nwhere he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great\nmajority\u2026\u201d (BGE 26). \u201c[T]he concept of\ngreatness,\u201d he says in the same work, \u201centails being\nnoble, wanting to be by oneself, being able to be different, standing\nalone and having to live independently\n[auf-eigne-Faust-leben-m\u00fcssen]\u201d (BGE 212). Indeed,\nthe higher type pursues solitude with something of a vengeance, for he\n\u201cknows how to make enemies everywhere,\u2026[He] constantly\ncontradicts the great majority not through words but through\ndeeds\u201d (WP 944). Unsurprisingly, then, the great or higher man\nlacks the \u201ccongeniality\u201d and\n\u201cgood-naturedness\u201d so often celebrated in contemporary\npopular culture. \u201cA great man\u2026is incommunicable: he finds\nit tasteless to be familiar\u2026\u201d (WP 962). More than that,\nthough, the higher type deals with others, when he has to, in a rather\ndistinctive way: \u201cA human being who strives for something great\nconsiders everyone he meets on his way either as a means or as a delay\nand obstacle \u2014 or as a temporary resting place\u201d (BGE 273).\nThus, \u201ca great man\u2026wants no \u2018sympathetic\u2019\nheart, but servants, tools; in his intercourse with men, he is always\nintent on making something out of them\u201d (WP 962). The\ngreat man approaches others instrumentally not only because of his\nfundamental proclivity for solitude, but because of another\ndistinguishing characteristic: he is consumed by his work, his\nresponsibilities, his projects.\n\nSecond, higher types seek burdens and responsibilities, in the pursuit\nof some unifying project. \u201cWhat is noble?\u201d\nNietzsche again asks in a Nachlass note of 1888. His answer:\n\u201cThat one instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities\u201d (WP\n944). So it was with Goethe: \u201che was not fainthearted but took\nas much as possible upon himself, over himself, into himself\u201d\n(TI IX:49). But the higher type does not seek out responsibilities and\ntasks arbitrarily. \u201cA great man,\u201d says Nietzsche displays\n\u201ca long logic in all of his activity\u2026he has the ability\nto extend his will across great stretches of his life and to despise,\nand reject everything petty about him\u201d (WP 962). This is the\ntrait Nietzsche sometimes refers to as having \u201cstyle\u201d in\n\u201ccharacter\u201d (GS 290). (Note that this famous passage (GS\n290) merely describes those \u2014 \u201cthe strong and\ndomineering natures\u201d \u2014 who are able \u201c\u2018to\ngive\u2019 style\u201d to their character; it does not presuppose\nthat just anyone can do so and it is not a recommendation that\neveryone try to do so.) Indeed, Nietzsche understood his own life in\nthese terms:\n\n[T]he organizing \u201cidea\u201d that is destined to rule [in\none\u2019s life and work] keeps growing deep down \u2014 it begins\nto command; slowly it leads us back from side roads and wrong\nroads; it prepares single qualities and fitnesses that will\none day prove to be indispensable as means toward a whole \u2014 one\nby one, it trains all subservient capacities before giving\nany hint of the dominant task, \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201caim,\u201d\nor \u201cmeaning.\u201d\n\n\nConsidered in this way, my life is simply wonderful. For the task of a\nrevaluation of all values more capacities may have been\nneeded than have ever dwelt together in a single individual\u2026.I\nnever even suspected what was growing in me \u2014 and one day all my\ncapacities, suddenly ripe, leaped forth in their ultimate\nperfection. (EH II:9). \n\n\nEarlier in Ecce Homo, Nietzsche describes himself as a higher\ntype, \u201ca well-turned-out-person\u201d (EH I:2), and thus we may\nconclude that it is a characteristic only of the higher type\nthat he is driven in pursuit of a project in the way described here.\nIndeed, it turns out to be precisely this kind of instinctive\ndrivenness that Nietzsche has partly in mind when he praises\n\u201chealth.\u201d\n\nThird, higher types are essentially healthy and resilient. One\nessential attribute of the \u201cwell-turned-out-person\u201d is\nthat he \u201chas a taste only for what is good for him; his\npleasure, his delight cease where the measure of what is good for him\nis transgressed. He guesses what remedies avail against what is\nharmful; he exploits bad accidents to his advantage\u201d (EH I:2).\nBut this is just to say that a higher type is healthy, for\nhealth, Nietzsche tells us, means simply \u201cinstinctively\ncho[osing] the right means against wretched states\u201d (EH\nI:2). This permits us to understand Nietzsche\u2019s own declaration\nin Ecce Homo that he was \u201chealthy at\nbottom\u201d (EH I:2), a seemingly paradoxical claim for a\nphilosopher whose physical ailments were legion. Yet\n\u201chealth,\u201d for Nietzsche, is a term of art, meaning not the\nabsence of sickness, but something closer to resilience, to\nhow one deals with ordinary (physical) sickness and setbacks.\n\u201cFor a typical healthy person,\u201d Nietzsche says,\n\u201cbeing sick can even become an energetic stimulus for\nlife, for living more. This, in fact, is how [my own] long period of\nsickness appears to me now\u2026it was during the years of\nmy lowest vitality that I ceased to be a pessimist; the\ninstinct of self-restoration forbade me a philosophy of\npoverty and discouragement\u201d (EH I:2). To cease to be a pessimist\nis to reject MPS, for only under the color of MPS does life appear to\nlack value. Thus, being healthy, in turn, entails a distinctive\nnon-pessimistic attitude towards life \u2014 which is yet a fourth\nmark of the higher type.\n\nFourth, higher types affirm life, meaning that they are prepared to\nwill the eternal return of their lives. In Beyond Good\nand Evil, Nietzsche describes \u201cthe opposite ideal\u201d to\nthat of moralists and pessimists like Schopenhauer as \u201cthe ideal\nof the most high-spirited, alive, and world-affirming human being who\nhas not only come to terms and learned to get along with whatever was\nand is, but who wants to have what was and is repeated into\nall eternity\u201d (BGE 56). Put more simply: the higher type\nembraces the doctrine of the eternal recurrence and thus evinces what\nNietzsche often calls a \u201cDionysian\u201d or\n\u201clife-affirming\u201d attitude. A person, for Nietzsche, has a\nDionysian attitude toward life insofar as he affirms his life\nunconditionally; in particular, insofar as he affirms it including the\n\u201csuffering\u201d or other hardships it has involved. So someone\nwho says, \u201cI would gladly live my life again, except for my\nfirst marriage,\u201d would not affirm life in the requisite sense.\nThus, we may say that a person affirms his life in Nietzsche\u2019s\nsense only insofar as he would gladly will its eternal return: i.e.,\nwill the repetition of his entire life through eternity. In fact,\nNietzsche calls \u201cthe idea of the eternal recurrence\u201d the\n\u201chighest formulation of affirmation that is at all\nattainable\u201d (EH III:Z-1; cf. BGE 56). Higher men, then, are\nmarked by a distinctive Dionysian attitude toward their life: they\nwould gladly will the repetition of their life eternally.\n\nStrikingly, Nietzsche claims that precisely this attitude\ncharacterized both himself and Goethe. Speaking, for example, of the\nneglect by his contemporaries of his work, Nietzsche writes: \u201cI\nmyself have never suffered from all this; what is necessary\ndoes not hurt me; amor fati [love of fate] is my inmost\nnature\u201d (EH III:CW-4). Regarding Goethe, Nietzsche says that,\n\u201cSuch a spirit\u2026stands amid the cosmos with a joyous and\ntrusting fatalism, in the faith\u2026that all is redeemed\nand affirmed in the whole\u2026.Such a faith, however, is the\nhighest of all possible faiths: I have baptized it with the name of\nDionysus\u201d (TI IX:49).\n\nFinally, the higher type of human being has a distinctive bearing\ntowards others and especially towards himself: he has self-reverence.\n\u201cThe \u2018higher nature\u2019 of the great man,\u201d says\nNietzsche in a striking Nachlass note of 1888 \u201clies in\nbeing different, in incommunicability, in distance of rank, not in an\neffect of any kind \u2014 even if he made the whole globe\ntremble\u201d (WP 876; cf. GS 55). This is perhaps the most unusual\nfeature of Nietzsche\u2019s discussion of the higher type, for it\nsuggests that, at bottom, being a higher type is a matter of\n\u201cattitude\u201d or \u201cbearing.\u201d In a section of\nBeyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche once again answers the\nquestion, \u201cWhat is noble?\u201d, this time as follows:\n\u201cIt is not the works, it is the faith that is decisive\nhere, that determines the order of rank\u2026: some fundamental\ncertainty that a noble soul has about itself, something that cannot be\nsought, nor found, nor perhaps lost. The noble soul has reverence\n[Ehrfurcht] for itself\u201d (BGE 287). Self-reverence \u2014\nto revere and respect oneself as one might a god \u2014 is no small\nachievement, as the proliferation of \u201cself-help\u201d programs\nand pop psychology slogans like \u201cI\u2019m OK, you\u2019re\nOK\u201d would suggest. Self-loathing, self-doubt, and\nself-laceration are the norm among human beings; to possess a\n\u201cfundamental certainty\u201d about oneself is, Nietzsche thinks\nquite plausibly, a unique state of affairs.\n\nAllied with this posture of self-reverence are other distinctive\nattitudes that distinguish the bearing of the higher man. \u201cThe\nnoble human being,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201chonors himself as one\nwho is powerful, also as one who has power over himself, who knows how\nto speak and be silent, who delights in being severe and hard with\nhimself and respects all severity and hardness\u201d (BGE 260). (The\nhigher man, unsurprisingly, is no hedonist: \u201cWhat is\nnoble?\u201d asks Nietzsche: \u201cThat one leaves happiness to the\ngreat majority: happiness as peace of soul, virtue, comfort,\nAnglo-angelic shopkeeperdom a la Spencer\u201d (WP 944).) In an\nearlier work, Nietzsche explains that:\n\n[T]he passion that attacks those who are noble is peculiar\u2026.It\ninvolves the use of a rare and singular standard cold to everybody\nelse; the discovery of values for which no scales have been invented\nyet; offering sacrifices on altars that are dedicated to an unknown\ngod; a courage without any desire for honors; self-sufficiency that\noverflows and gives to men and things. (GS 55)\n\n\nIndeed, the ability to set his own standard of valuation is one of the\nmost distinctive achievements of the higher type, as we saw already in\nthe discussion of solitude. And \u201cthe highest man\u201d\nsays Nietzsche is \u201che who determines values and directs\nthe will of millennia by giving direction to the highest\nnatures\u201d (WP 999).\n\nConsidered all together, it becomes clear why creatives geniuses like\nGoethe, Beethoven, and Nietzsche himself should be the preferred\nexamples of the higher human being: for the characteristics of the\nhigher type so-described are precisely those that lend themselves to\nartistic and creative work. A penchant for solitude,\nan absolute devotion to one\u2019s tasks, an indifference to external\nopinion, a fundamental certainty about oneself and one\u2019s values\n(that often strikes others as hubris) \u2014 all these are the traits\nwe find, again and again, in artistic geniuses. (It turns out, for\nexample, that Beethoven, according to his leading biographer, had\nalmost all these characteristics to a striking degree; for discussion,\nsee Leiter 2002: 122\u2013123.)\n\nIf \u201cthe men of great creativity, the really great men according\nto my understanding\u201d (WP 957), men like Goethe and Beethoven,\nare Nietzsche\u2019s paradigmatic higher types, whose lives are\nmodels of flourishing excellence, is there anything systematic to be\nsaid about the theory of value that undergirds these judgments and\ninforms, in turn, Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality (MPS) on the\ngrounds that it thwarts the development of such men?\n\nOne popular idea (e.g., Schacht 1983, Richardson 1996) is that higher\nmen exemplify \u201cpower,\u201d which is claimed to be\nNietzsche\u2019s fundamental criterion of value. Such readings, alas,\nhave to employ the concept of \u201cpower\u201d rather elastically,\nsince the conglomeration of traits of higher human beings noted above\ndon\u2019t seem to be, in any ordinary sense, instances of\n\u201cpower\u201d or its manifestation. (Treating Nietzsche\u2019s\nfundamental criterion of value as \u201cpower\u201d confronts even\nmore serious textual and philosophical obstacles: see Section 3.1,\nbelow.)\n\nMore illuminating is Hurka\u2019s view (1993 and Hurka 2007) that\nNietzsche\u2019s evaluative posture conjoins perfectionism with\nmaximizing consequentialism: what has value are certain human\nexcellences (or perfections), and states of affairs are assessed in\nterms of their maximization of these excellences. As Hurka helpfully\nobserves (1993: 75), Nietzsche seems to operate with the opposite of\nRawls\u2019s maximin principle, what Hurka calls appropriately\n\u201cmaximax.\u201d Hurka states this as a rule for conduct\n(\u201ceach agent\u2019s overriding goal should be not a sum or\naverage of lifetime value, but the greatest lifetime value of the\nsingle most perfect individual, or, if perfections are not fully\ncomparable, of the few most perfect individuals\u201d [1993: 75]),\nbut given the earlier caveats about reading Nietzsche as a\nconventional normative theorist, it is better to treat maximax as\nreflecting the implicit structure of Nietzsche\u2019s revaluation of\nvalues: he rejects MPS because it fails to maximize the perfection of\nthe highest human beings, and he does so without, it appears, any\nregard for the costs to the herd of such a rejection (see Section\n4).\n\nThis leaves the question whether there are (formal or substantive)\ncriteria of \u201cperfection\u201d for Nietzsche? Many writers\n(e.g., Hurka 2007; Nehamas 1985; Richardson 1996) are attracted to the\nidea that \u201cstyle\u201d or \u201cunity\u201d is a criterion of\nexcellence or perfection for Nietzsche, and, indeed, as noted above,\nthe pursuit of a unified or coherent life project is a characteristic\nfeature of those Nietzsche deems to be higher men. Whether such style\nor coherence suffices is a vexed interpretive question, since it is\nnot entirely clear that the formal criterion of style or unity is\navailable only to Goethes and Beethovens: did not Kant, that\n\u201ccatastrophic spider\u201d as Nietzsche unflatteringly calls\nhim (A 11), exhibit an extraordinarily coherent style of creative\nproductivity over many years?\n\nOthers (e.g., Magnus 1978) take Nietzsche\u2019s idea of eternal\nrecurrence (the hallmark of life-affirmation, as noted above) as the\ncriterion of a well-lived life: perfection is a matter of living in\nsuch a way that one is ready to gladly will the repetition of\none\u2019s life, in all its particulars, in to eternity. This, too,\nseems both too thin and too severe as a criterion of perfection\nstanding alone: too thin, because anyone suitably superficial and\ncomplacent might will the eternal return; too severe, because it seems\nto require that a post-Holocaust Goethe gladly will the repetition of\nthe Holocaust.\n\nNehamas (1985), who shares some of Magnus\u2019s view, adds a\nsurprising twist to this account: he claims that Nietzsche does not\ndescribe his ideal person \u2014 his \u201chigher\nman\u201d \u2014 but rather \u201cexemplifies\u201d such a person\nin the form of the \u201ccharacter\u201d that is constituted by and\nexemplified in his corpus. Nietzsche, however, describes at\ngreat length and in many places (e.g. D 201; GS 55; BGE 287; NCW\nEpilogue:2; WP 943) the types of persons he admires; and he also\ndescribes himself as such a person (e.g., EH I:2) In any\ncase, Nehamas\u2019s view would have the odd consequence that for\nNietzsche to have had a positive ethical vision at any point earlier\nin his career he would have had to anticipate writing the series of\nbooks he actually wrote, such that his ethical ideal would be properly\nexemplified in them! Needless to say, there is no reason to think this\nwas Nietzsche\u2019s view.\n",
