    "main_text": "Wholes || Integral wholes\n2.1 Integral wholes\n\nMuch of what we encounter in the material world is, or can be\nconsidered to be, a whole. Cars, houses, plants, and human beings are\ncomposed out of bits of metal, plastic, cellulose, or flesh and bone.\nThese items are not only divisible into the components just mentioned;\nthey are divisible into other parts such as carburetors, doors,\nleaves, and hands.\n\nMedieval philosophers consider the wholes mentioned above to be either\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d or \u201ccontiguous\u201d integral wholes,\nwhere a contiguous whole is a type of \u201cdiscrete\u201d whole.\nContinuous wholes are wholes whose parts share a common boundary.\nDiscrete wholes are wholes whose parts do not share a common boundary.\nThe parts of discrete integral wholes can be either close to one\nanother, or relatively scattered. Contiguous wholes consist of parts\nthat are discrete, but spatially close together. Discrete wholes whose\nparts are relatively diffuse are \u201cdisaggregated\u201d integral\nwholes. (For a fairly comprehensive catalog of the kinds of integral\nwholes, see Anonymous Compendium Logicae Porretanum\nIII.12.)\n\nWhether an item is a continuous or contiguous whole will depend upon\nother metaphysical commitments. Some early medieval philosophers only\nhave simple artifacts like fences and walls in mind when they talk\nabout contiguous wholes. But others think that even more complicated\nman-made objects, such as wagons, houses, and clocks are contiguous,\nand not continuous wholes, because only substances are continuous\nwholes. Abelard and Aquinas both hold the latter position, and thus,\nthat only individual donkeys, palm trees, human beings, and the like,\nare continuous wholes. Abelard thinks that this is true because only\nGod can fuse parts together into a continuous unity. Human\nmanipulations, no matter how skilled, are only capable of placing\nparts in close proximity to one another (Dialectica\n417.4\u201337; 419.35\u2013420.6). Drawing upon Aristotle\u2019s\nreflections on form and matter (especially in his De Anima,\nPhysics and Metaphysics), Aquinas thinks that only\nsubstances possess the kind of form that can inhere in each and every\npart of the whole and thereby make it truly one (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 76, art. 8; Quaestiones de Anima q. 10;\nsee also Pasnau 2002, 79\u201388). An artifact possesses a form that\nmerely orders and arranges the parts of the whole. We can tell whether\na form imbues its parts in the manner required of a substantial form\nby attending to the effect of the form\u2019s existence on the\nfunctionality of the parts. The human soul inheres in the hands of a\nhuman being as a substantial form because if the soul were removed,\nthat part would cease to function as a hand \u2013 indeed, Aquinas\ninsists that this thing would cease to be a hand. By contrast, when\nthe form of a car is removed from the items that make up the car, many\nof these items can still be car-parts. For example, a carburetor can\nstill be a carburetor; it can be placed in another car and continue\nfunctioning as a\n carburetor.[2]\n\nIn addition to artifacts, plants, and animals, some medieval\nphilosophers expand the class of continuous integral wholes to cover\nhomogeneous masses, such as some gold or some water, and the class of\ndisaggregated integral wholes to include scattered mereological sums,\nsuch as the sum of this mountain and this dog. However, one will not\nfind any medieval philosopher who assents to the modern mereological\nthesis of universalism, or what David Lewis calls \u201cunrestricted\nfusion\u201d (1991, 74; cf. Simons 1987, 108\u201312 and the\nsubsection on unrestricted fusions in the Encyclopedia entry on\n mereology).\n Peter Abelard comes close when he asserts that any two items, even\nones belonging to different categories of being, can constitute a\nplurality (Dialectica 548.19\u201322; see also the anonymous\ntwelfth-century Introductiones Montanae maiores, 69rb, where\nAbelard\u2019s thesis is mocked). But one suspects that even Abelard,\nif pressed, might step back from assenting to a full-blown version of\nuniversalism for theological reasons. For in discussions of\nGod\u2019s simplicity, it is routinely noted that God is not\nintrinsically composite and that He cannot be combined with\nanything else and that nothing can be combined with Him (see,\ne.g., Aquinas Summa Theologiae I, q. 3, arts. 7\u20138).\nThis strong thesis about the lack of composition in God is maintained\nbecause being a part of something implies a certain sort of\npotentiality and incompleteness. If anything could be a part of a\nwhole that also has God as a part, then there is something that God\ncould be\u2013namely, a part of this composite\u2013that He\ncurrently is not. And even if He currently is a part of the sum of all\nthings (for instance), given that some of the other parts are\ncontingent beings, the sum of all things is contingent. Accordingly,\nGod\u2019s parthood is contingent, or has a potentiality. But God is\nfully actual and necessary. Hence, God cannot be a part of some\ngreater\n composite.[3]\n\nAs a more general point, it must be remembered that medieval\nphilosophers are for the most part working within an Aristotelian\nframework, and like Aristotle, their paradigmatic examples of unified\ncomposite things are substances. If a thing is not unified by a\nsubstantial form, then that thing has a lesser kind of unity. Humans\nand dogs are more unified than houses and wagons. Houses and wagons,\nnonetheless, are unified by a form\u2014 namely, an accidental\nform\u2014and so they have a unity of a sort. Moreover, this kind\nunity will be greater than the unity of a mere collection of things.\nHence, as a general rule, the more gerrymandered a collection of parts\nis, the more likely it is that this composite\u2019s status as a\nwhole will be called into question (see, e.g., Aquinas In\nMetaphysica expositio, Book V, lectio XXI \u00a7\u00a7\n1102\u20134; Jean Buridan Summulae de Dialectica 8.1.4).\n\nIn addition to material beings, some medieval philosophers allow\nnon-material items to be integral wholes. For example, Ockham thinks\nthat complex mental acts can be wholes, and Aquinas insists that\nactions such as penance are integral wholes (Ockham Quaestiones in\nphysicam q. 6 [Opera VI, 407\u201310]; In De\nInt. I, prooemium, 6 [Opera II, 354\u20138]; Aquinas\nSumma Theologiae III, q. 90, art. 3). Abelard insists that\ntemporal items are not integral wholes, but he seems to be in the\nminority. Non-material integral wholes do not sit easily under either\nthe continuous or the discrete category, since their parts cannot be\nrelated to one another with respect to location. If asked to pick,\nmedieval philosophers tend to label temporal wholes and events as\ncontinuous wholes, but they are not continuous in the way that a\nbronze rod is continuous. Their parts to not share some spatial\nboundary; they come one after another in continuous succession. For\nthis reason, these wholes are sometimes called\n\u201csuccessive\u201d wholes (Anonymous Compendium Logiae\nPorretanum III.12). In addition to aggregates of time, processes\n(that is, things that take time to unfold) are also sometimes\nconsidered to be successive wholes (see, e.g., Aquinas Summa\nTheologiae III, q. 90, art. 3, ad 3).\n\nIn short, an astounding variety of items can be integral wholes. Yet,\nno matter how large this category becomes, most medieval philosophers\ninsist that the class of integral wholes does not exhaust the domain\nof items that can be wholes. In particular, there are two types of\nitem that require their own category: universals and the so-called\n\u201cpotential wholes\u201d.\n",
