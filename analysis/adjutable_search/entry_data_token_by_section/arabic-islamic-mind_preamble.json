    "main_text": "\n\n\n Muslim philosophers considered the quest\nfor knowledge as a divine command, and knowledge of the soul, and\nparticularly of the intellect, as a critical component of this quest.\nMastery of this subject provided a framework within which the mechanics\nand nature of our sensations and thoughts could be explained and\nintegrated, and offered the epistemological foundation for every other\nfield of inquiry. As opposed to the Occasionalist views of the\nMutakallim\u00fbn, the Muslim theologians, philosophers wished\nto anchor their knowledge of the world in a stable and predictable\nphysical reality. This entailed naturalizing the soul (nafs in\nArabic) itself, charting the relation between its external and internal\nsenses and between its imaginative and rational faculties. However, the\nultimate goal of this subject, conjunction of the intellect with\nuniversal truth, had a decidedly metaphysical and spiritual aspect.\n\n\n The psychological views delineated by\nAristotle were the dominant paradigm for Muslim philosophers, as\nmodified by Hellenistic variations expressing Platonic perspectives.\nThe ninth to the twelfth centuries is the period of rigorous\nphilosophizing that characterizes classical Islamic philosophy, and it\nis the period and subject with which this article is concerned.
