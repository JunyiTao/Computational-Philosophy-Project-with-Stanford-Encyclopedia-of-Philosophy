    "main_text": "\n1. Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences\n\nNearly all of our most successful empirical sciences employ a great\ndeal of mathematics. In addition, scientists often emphasize the value\nof explaining some phenomenon that they have discovered. It is natural\nto wonder, then, if mathematics is well-suited to contribute to the\nexplanation of natural phenomena and what these contributions might\nbe. In the philosophy of science most accounts of explanation identify\nan explanation with an appropriate description of a cause (see Salmon\n1984, Cartwright 1989, Woodward 2003, Strevens 2008, and Beebee,\nHitchcock & Menzies 2010 for an overview). Nearly everyone can\nadmit that mathematical tools are an excellent means of tracking or\nrepresenting causes. For example, mathematics can be used to explain\nwhy Halley\u2019s comet\u2019s orbit has a period of 75 years. Much\nof the debate about mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences\nhas focused on more contentious cases: what role might mathematics\nplay in non-causal explanations, if there are any, and how might these\ncases challenge this or that account of causal explanation (Reutlinger\n& Saatsi 2018)?\n\nOne kind of case that has been emphasized aims to explain the\npossibility or impossibility of some process. For example, why can we\nnot divide our 23 strawberries equally among three friends (Lange\n2013), or why can we arrange 81 stamps into a 9 by 9 array? The\nlegitimate explanations seem to be that 23 is not divisible by 3\nwithout remainder and that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81.\\) Neither mathematical\nfact is a cause of the feature of the process in question, so we seem\nto have a non-causal explanation where mathematics is part of the\nexplanation. The possibility or impossibility of other processes are\nexplained by other areas of mathematics that investigate structures or\nformal features of natural systems. For example, why can we not make a\ncircuit of the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg that involves crossing each\nof the bridges exactly once (Pincock 2007, Molinini 2012)? This is\nexplained by the abstract structure of the bridge network. Why is it\npossible for there to be stable planetary orbits? One explanation that\nhas been proposed appeals to the dimensions of space-time (Woodward\n2003).\n\nAnother kind of non-causal mathematical explanation deals with a\nstriking or surprising feature of a phenomenon, where that feature can\nbe identified through a mathematical analysis of the situation. The\nfeature may be tied to a minimization process, or be especially\nresilient or stable for what is arguably a mathematical reason.\nPerhaps the most discussed case is the length in years of the\nlife-cycle of three species of periodic cicada: why are these lengths\neither 13 or 17 years (Baker 2005, 2017)? An explanation is that 13\nand 17 are prime numbers and that prime numbered life-cycles confer a\nrelative fitness advantage in avoiding predators and competition for\nscarce resources like food. Other broadly evolutionary cases include\nthe hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells (Lyon & Colyvan 2008,\nR\u00e4z 2017, Wakil & Justus 2017) and the pattern of seeds in a\nsunflower (Lyon 2012). There is an extensive literature on how these\noptimality explanations might work in biology and economics (Potochnik\n2007, Rice 2015, 2021). However, this explanatory contribution from\nmathematics can be found in other domains as well. For example, why do\nsoap films obey Plateau\u2019s laws (Lyon 2012, Pincock 2015a)? This\ncan be explained through a process of surface minimization, subject to\nconstraints. The mathematics of the situation is central to the\ncharacter that the laws take on. Other cases turn on a mathematical\nanalysis of the stability or instability of some process. For example,\nwhy do the so-called Kirkwood gaps appear in our solar system\u2019s\nasteroid belt (Colyvan 2010)? Occupying some spatial regions is\nunstable, so that an asteroid that starts in such a region is\noverwhelmingly likely to leave it. Similar analyses explain patterns\nin the rings of Saturn or the collapse of an engineered structure like\na bridge. (See also Ashbaugh, Chicone & Cushman 1991, Colyvan\n2001, Lipton 2004, Baker 2015a and Lange 2017 for a range of other\nexamples.)\n\nThe rest of section 1 will consider some of the history of the debates\nabout non-causal mathematical explanations (section 1.1) and their\nsignificance for various theories of scientific explanation (1.2). The\nsection then turns to two other debates that are closely related to\nthese features of these explanations: how mathematical models may\nexplain despite their highly idealized character (1.3) and how the\nexplanatory role of mathematics in science could support a platonistic\ninterpretation of pure mathematics (1.4).\n1.1 Some historical remarks\n\nDoes mathematics help explain the physical world or does it actually\nhinder a grasp of the physical mechanisms that explain the how and why\nof natural phenomena? It is not possible here to treat this topic in\nits full complexity but a few remarks will help the reader appreciate\nthe historical importance of the question.\n\nAristotle describes his ideal of scientific knowledge in\n\u201cPosterior Analytics\u201d in terms of, among other things,\nknowledge of the cause:\n\nWe suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a\nthing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the\nsophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact\ndepends as the cause of the fact and of no other, and further, that\nthe fact could not be other than it is. (BWA, 111, Post. An. I.1, 71b\n5\u201310)\n\n\nThe causes [aitia] in question are the four Aristotelian causes:\nformal, material, efficient, and final. Nowadays, translators and\ncommentators of Aristotle prefer to translate aition [aitia] as\n\u2018explanation[s]\u2019, so that the theory of the four causes\nbecomes an account of four types of explanations. For instance, here\nis Barnes\u2019 translation of the passage quoted earlier: \u201cWe\nthink we understand a thing simpliciter (and not in the sophistic\nfashion accidentally) whenever we think we are aware both that the\nexplanation because of which the object is is its explanation, and\nthat it is not possible for this to be otherwise.\u201d (CWA, 115,\nPost. An. I.1, 71b 5\u201310)\n\nBut how do we obtain scientific knowledge? Scientific knowledge is\nobtained through demonstration. However, not all logically cogent\nproofs provide us with the kind of demonstration that yields\nscientific knowledge. In a scientific demonstration \u201cthe\npremisses must be true, primary, immediate, better known and prior to\nthe conclusion, which is further related to them as effect to\ncauses.\u201d (BWA, 112, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20\u201325) In\nBarnes\u2019 translation: \u201cIf, then, understanding is as we\nposited, it is necessary for demonstrative understanding in particular\nto depend on things which are true and primitive and immediate and\nmore familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the\nconclusion.\u201d (CWA, 115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20\u201325)\n\nAccordingly, in \u201cPosterior Analytics\u201d I.13, Aristotle\ndistinguished between demonstrations \u201cof the fact\u201d and\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. Although both are\nlogically cogent only the latter mirror the causal structure of the\nphenomena under investigation, and thus provide us with knowledge. We\ncan call them, respectively, \u201cnon-explanatory\u201d and\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d demonstrations.\n\nIn Aristotle\u2019s system, physics was not mathematized although\ncausal reasonings were proper to it. However, Aristotle also discussed\nextensively the so-called mixed sciences, such as optics, harmonics,\nand mechanics, characterizing them as \u201cthe more physical of the\nmathematical sciences\u201d. There is a relation of subordination\nbetween these mixed sciences and areas of pure mathematics (see Dear\n2011). For instance, harmonics is subordinated to arithmetic and\noptics to geometry. Aristotle is in no doubt that there are\nmathematical explanations of physical phenomena:\n\nFor here it is for the empirical scientist to know the fact and for\nthe mathematical to know the reason why; for the latter have the\ndemonstrations of the explanations, and often they do not know the\nfact, just as those who consider the universal often do not know some\nof the particulars through lack of observation. (CWA, vol. I, 128,\nPost. An. I.13, 79a1\u201379a7)\n\n\nHowever, the topic of whether mathematics could give explanations of\nnatural phenomena was one on which there was disagreement. As the\ndomains to which mathematics could be applied grew, so also did the\nresistance to it. One source of tension consisted in trying to\nreconcile the Aristotelian conception of pure mathematics, as\nabstracting from matter and motion, with the fact that both physics\n(natural philosophy) and the mixed sciences are all conversant about\nnatural phenomena and thus dependent on matter and motion. For\ninstance, an important debate in the Renaissance, known as the\nQuaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum, focused in large part on\nwhether mathematics could play the explanatory role assigned to it by\nAristotle (Mancuso 1996, ch. 1). Some argued that lacking causality,\nmathematics could not be the \u2018explanatory\u2019 link in the\nexplanation of natural phenomena (see also sections 1.2 and 1.3).\n\nBy the time we reach the seventeenth century and the Newtonian\nrevolution in physics, the problem reappears in the context of a\nchange of criteria of explanation and intelligibility. This has been\nbeautifully described in an article by Y. Gingras (2001). Gingras\nargues that \u201cthe use of mathematics in dynamics (as distinct\nfrom its use in kinematics) had the effect of transforming the very\nmeaning of the term \u2018explanation\u2019 as it was used by\nphilosophers in the seventeenth century\u201d (2001, 385). What\nGingras describes, among other things, is how the mathematical\ntreatment of force espoused by Newton and his followers \u2013 a\ntreatment that ignored the mechanisms that could explain why and how\nthis force operated \u2013 became an accepted standard for\nexplanation during the eighteenth century. After referring to the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries\u2019 discussions on the\nmechanical explanation of gravity, he remarks:\n\nThis episode shows that the evaluation criteria for what was to count\nas an acceptable \u2018explanation\u2019 (of gravitation in this\ncase) were shifting towards mathematics and away from mechanical\nexplanations. Confronted with a mathematical formulation of a\nphenomenon for which there was no mechanical explanation, more and\nmore actors chose the former even at the price of not finding the\nlatter. This was something new. For the whole of the seventeenth\ncentury and most of the eighteenth, to \u2018explain\u2019 a\nphysical phenomenon meant to give a physical mechanism involved in its\nproduction. \u2026 The publication of Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia marks the beginning of this shift where\nmathematical explanations came to be preferred to mechanical\nexplanations when the latter did not conform to calculations. (Gingras\n2001, 398)\n\n\nAmong those who resisted this confusion between \u201cphysical\nexplanations\u201d and \u201cmathematical explanations\u201d was\nthe Jesuit Louis Castel. In \u201cVrai syst\u00e8me de physique\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale de M. Isaac Newton\u201d (1734), he discussed\nPrincipia\u2019s proposition XIII of Book III (on\nKepler\u2019s law of areas). He granted that the proposition\nconnected mathematically the inverse square law to the ellipticity of\nthe course of the planets. However, he objected that \u201cthe one is\nnot the cause, the reason of the other\u201d (Castel 1734, 97) and\nthat Newton had not provided any physical explanation, only a\nmathematical one. Indeed \u201cphysical reasons are necessary reasons\nof entailment, of linkages, of mechanism. In Newton, there is none of\nthis kind.\u201d (Castel 1734, 121)\n\nSome contemporary discussions bear close proximity to these worries.\nConsider Morrison\u2019s book Unifying Scientific Theories\n(2000). One of the major theses of the book is that unification and\nexplanation often pull in different directions and come apart\n(contrary to what is claimed by unification theories of explanation).\nOne of the examples discussed in her introduction reminds us of\nCastel\u2019s objections:\n\nAnother example is the unification of terrestrial and celestial\nphenomena in Newton\u2019s Principia. Although influenced by\nCartesian mechanics, one of the most striking features of the\nPrincipia is its move away from explanations of planetary\nmotions in terms of mechanical causes. Instead, the mathematical form\nof force is highlighted; the planetary ellipses discovered by Kepler\nare \u201cexplained\u201d in terms of a mathematical description of\nthe force that produces those motions. Of course, the inverse-square\nlaw of gravitational attraction explains why the planets move in the\nway they do, but there is no explanation of how this gravitational\nforce acts on bodies (how it is transported), nor is there any account\nof its causal properties. (Morrison 2000, 4)\n\n\nUsing several case studies (Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetism, the\nelectroweak unification, etc.), Morrison argues that the mathematical\nstructures involved in the unification \u201coften supply little or\nno theoretical explanation of the physical dynamics of the unified\ntheory\u201d (Morrison 2000, 4). In short, the mathematical formalism\nfacilitates unification but does not help us explain the how and why\nof physical phenomena.\n\nWe have to close these historical remarks here, although it would be\ninteresting to pursue these questions in a more systematic way into\nthe nineteenth and the twentieth centuries (see however Dorato 2017\nfor a wide-ranging claim concerning \u201cexplanatory switches\u201d\nat crucial junctions in the history of physics).\n\nThe aim of the above was to prepare the ground for showing how in\ncontemporary discussions in philosophy of science, to which we now\nturn, we are still confronted with such issues.\n1.2 Theories of explanation\n\nTwo legacies of the Aristotelian tradition surveyed in section 1.1 are\nthat explanations require causes and that providing an explanation\nrequires giving an argument that turns on laws. Debates in the\nphilosophy of science since the 1960s have shown how one can privilege\none legacy over another (Salmon 1989). Hempel\u2019s\ndeductive-nomological analysis of explanation requires that an\nexplanation be a deductively valid argument from true premises, where\nat least one premise is a scientific law (Hempel 1965). Hempel and\nother empiricists in this broad tradition are wary of making causes\ncentral to explanation. This is apparent even in some of\nHempel\u2019s critics such as Kitcher, who emphasizes the unifying\npower of explanations. For Kitcher, an explanation is an instance of a\ndeductive argument scheme, where the schemes to adopt are identified\non the basis of global features of the claims we accept (Kitcher 1989,\nsee section 2.2.2 for additional discussion).\n\nBy contrast, Salmon\u2019s work has persuaded many philosophers of\nscience that explanations need only provide causal information about\nthe explanatory target (Salmon 1984, 1989). For Salmon and others in\nthis tradition, explanations do not require laws and need not even be\narguments. One development of this approach preserves Salmon\u2019s\nemphasis on causal mechanisms as a special sort of process. The\nso-called \u201cnew mechanists\u201d endorse a broader notion of\ncausal mechanism than Salmon allowed for, and identify an explanation\nof some target with a mechanism that produces it (Machamer, Darden\n& Craver 2000). Other approaches to causal explanation include\nDavid Lewis\u2019 counterfactual analysis of causation (Lewis 2004)\nand Woodward\u2019s interventionist theory (Woodward 2003, 2021a).\nDespite their differences, Lewis and Woodward allow for causal\nexplanations in the absence of mechanisms. This makes their approaches\nto explanation easier to generalize to non-causal cases.\n\nPhilosophical discussions of non-causal mathematical explanation can\nbe classified based on how they are related to these debates about\nscientific explanation more generally. One position argues for the\nneed to restore something like Hempel\u2019s emphasis on laws or\nKitcher\u2019s claims about unification (Baron 2019). Another\nposition generalizes from an account of causal explanation so that it\ncan include these mathematical cases (Saatsi & Pexton 2013,\nReutlinger 2016). Yet a third position is pluralist about explanation,\nand argues that explanations come in a variety of distinct sorts that\ncannot be fit into one or the other of these two options (Pincock\n2018, 2023).\n\nLange\u2019s extensive discussions of non-causal explanations can be\nseen as a valiant attempt to preserve the law-based approach to\nscientific explanation that goes back to Hempel (and Aristotle) (Lange\n2013, 2017). Lange\u2019s work on laws emphasizes how to identify\nclaims with the right kind of modal strength to contribute to\nexplanations (Lange 2009). Consider the contrast between \u201cAll\ngold cubes are less than 1 cubic mile in volume\u201d and \u201cAll\nUr-235 cubes are less than 1 cubic mile in volume\u201d. The former\nstatement is contingent, while the latter statement has some degree of\nnecessity. This allows the latter statement to contribute to an\nexplanation. Lange\u2019s approach to mathematical explanation\nextends this point so that mathematical claims can function in\nexplanations in a distinctive way due to their special degree of\nnecessity. This allows mathematics to contribute to what Lange calls\nexplanations by constraint that show how some outcome is guaranteed to\narise (Lange 2017, ch. 2). This is how Lange treats the strawberry\ndivision case and also cases like the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.\nOther mathematical explanations turn on the dimensions of the\nquantities involved or the statistical features of some process (Lange\n2017, ch. 5, 6). In each of these types of cases, the modal character\nof the mathematical claim allows it to explain just as the modal\ncharacter of ordinary scientific laws allow them to explain.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many philosophers have challenged Lange\u2019s\nproposals in ways that are reminiscent of how Salmon objected to\nHempel\u2019s deductive-nomological account (Pincock 2015a,\nReutlinger 2017b, Saatsi 2018). For example, Craver and Povich object\nthat, in the absence of a causal constraint on explanation,\nLange\u2019s proposals lack any suitable worldly basis, and so count\ntoo many representations of some target as explanatory (Craver &\nPovich 2017, Lange 2018a). As a mechanist about explanation quite\ngenerally, Craver seems inclined to dismiss the possibility of\nnon-causal mathematical explanations (Craver 2014). His co-author\nPovich has offered a more constructive proposal for these cases that\nallows for explanations with a variety of worldly or ontic bases\n(Povich 2020, 2021). Povich deploys a version of what amounts to a new\nconsensus for handling non-causal explanations: if a proposed\nexplanation relates to the right counterfactuals in the right way,\nthen it is legitimate (Woodward 2018, Rice 2021). However, there is as\nyet no agreement on what sorts of counterfactual tests are sufficient\nfor explanation (see Lange 2021a for some objections to this\napproach).\n\nOne option is to treat a mathematical claim like a law that governs\nsome situation, and to credit the mathematics with explanatory power\nwhenever it allows us to assess a range of counterfactual scenarios.\nThis is Reutlinger\u2019s proposal, which deliberately loosens the\nrequirements that Woodward places on interventions (Reutlinger 2016,\n2017a, 2018, Reutlinger, Colyvan & Krzyzanowska 2022). For\nexample, in the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg case, the mathematical\nclaim indicates that a circuit of the bridges would be possible in the\ncounterfactual scenario where some of the actual bridges were absent.\nReutlinger concludes that the mathematical claim thus explains what is\ngoing on in the actual world by indicating what makes a difference to\nthe feature of interest. Arguably, though, this approach is too\nliberal. Suppose we ask why we have \\(81\\) stamps. It is a\nmathematical truth that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81,\\) and so we can arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array. So if we could not arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array, then we would not have \\(81\\)\nstamps. But the truth that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81\\) does not explain why we\nhave \\(81\\) stamps.\n\nAnother option is to treat a mathematical claim like a cause. Then the\nclaim will be explanatory when a \u201ccounter-mathematical\u201d\nthat supposes that this claim is false winds up making a difference to\nthe target in question. This sort of counter-mathematical involves\nimpossible worlds where necessary truths come out false. This is the\noption that Povich takes (Povich 2020, 2021). Another family of\nproposals along these lines has been developed by Baron in\ncollaboration with Colyvan and Ripley (Baron, Colyvan & Ripley\n2017, 2020). Baron et al. draw on David Lewis\u2019 procedure for\nevaluating counterfactuals tied to causation: consider the scenario\nthat arises through a miraculous change that is just enough of a\nchange to make the antecedent of the counterfactual true. In addition,\nBaron et al. require that the features of the natural world that are\nimplicated in this shift in the mathematics be changed in a\ncorresponding way. For example, for the cicada case, the central\nmathematical claim is that prime periods minimize intersections when\ncompared to non-prime periods. So among the years 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n17, and 18 (that are identified by ecological constraints), the primes\n13 and 17 stand out as comparatively more fit. Baron et al. consider\nthe consequences of supposing that 13 is not prime. If 13 was not\nprime, they argue, then it would have factors besides 1 and 13, and so\nhaving a 13-year life cycle would not confer any relative fitness\nadvantage. Thus, in this impossible world, the cicadas would not have\nevolved a 13-year life cycle. This is meant to show that 13\u2019s\nbeing prime makes a difference to the evolution of 13-year life cycle\ncicadas. (See also section 2.2.1 for a parallel debate for pure\nmathematics.)\n\nThere are pressing questions for these proposals about the nature of\nimpossible worlds and our epistemic access to them (Kasirzadeh 2021a).\nAnother sort of objection has been raised by Baron himself in work\nthat develops another account of mathematical explanation (Baron\n2020). Baron, like Baker and Lange, aims to identify a special class\nof genuinely or distinctively mathematical explanations of natural\nphenomena (Baker 2005, 2009a, Lange 2013). What is special about these\ncases is that the mathematics explains, but not by representing or\ndescribing some non-mathematical explainers such as causes or other\nworldly difference makers. Baron\u2019s general worry is that simply\nusing countermathematicals fails to distinguish explanations that\nemploy mathematics from these genuinely mathematical explanations. We\ncan see this using our original stamp case: why can we arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array? Because we have \\(81\\) stamps and\n\\(9 \\times 9 = 81.\\) This case passes Baron et al.\u2019s\ncountermathematical test, for were \\(9 \\times 9\\) not equal to \\(81\\),\nthen our \\(81\\) stamps could not be arranged in a \\(9 \\times 9\\)\narray. However, the mathematical claim here seems to be simply\ntracking the non-mathematical features of the stamps, and so Baron and\nothers would not want to count this as a special sort of mathematical\nexplanation.\n\nBaron concludes that some additional requirements must be imposed\nbeyond the truth of the relevant countermathematical. Here Baron\nreaches back to Kitcher\u2019s idea that explanations are instances\nof a special sort of argument scheme (Kitcher 1989), where the schemes\nare found through a process of appropriately unifying the claims that\nwe accept (for objections to this proposal see Pincock 2023 and Povich\nforthcoming). Other recent work on non-causal mathematical\nexplanations also seems to be returning to some of the original\nsources of these debates. For example, Lange argues that the best way\nto make sense of the explanatory power of pure mathematics in the\nempirical sciences is to adopt an Aristotelian interpretation of pure\nmathematics (Lange 2021b).\n\nLyon proposed another way of relating mathematical explanations to\ncausal explanations by adapting Jackson and Pettit\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cprogram explanation\u201d (Jackson & Pettit 1990). A\nprogram explanation does not invoke a property that causes the outcome\nof interest. Instead, the explanation appeals to a property \\(A\\) that\nguarantees the presence of some member of a family of properties,\nwhere some such property \\(B\\) causes the outcome of interest. As Lyon\nsummarizes his proposal, \u201cAn explanation of an empirical fact is\nmathematical \u2013 i.e., it has mathematics doing explanatory work\n\u2013 if the explanation is a program explanation that uses\nmathematics in a way that is indispensable to the program\u201d (Lyon\n2012, 568). One concern with this proposal is that it includes cases\nwhere the mathematics merely represents some causally relevant\nproperty, as with the stamps case noted above: programming is too\nindiscriminate a relation to avoid this worry (Saatsi 2012).\n\nA sweeping way of dealing with the apparent tension between causes and\nmathematics has been pursued by some ontic structural realists\n(Ladyman & Ross 2007, French 2014). They identify the fundamental\nmetaphysical structure of the world with a mathematical structure. If\none adopted this kind of structural realism, then the explanatory\npower of mathematics in the empirical sciences would receive a\nsatisfying analysis. In fundamental physics, scientists would be\nworking with the fundamental mathematical structure directly, and so\nexplanations there would be essentially mathematical. In\nnon-fundamental domains such as biology or economics, scientists would\nbe investigating features of the world that are ultimately grounded in\nsome mathematical structure. So again it would make sense for many of\nthe explanations in non-fundamental sciences to be mathematical.\nCausal explanations would then turn out to be perfectly consistent\nwith more fundamental mathematical explanations. Few philosophers are\nwilling to adopt such a metaphysical position in order to resolve\nquestions about mathematical explanation, although at least one\nphysicist has defended this approach (Tegmark 2014).\n\nAnother, less metaphysical, solution to these difficulties is to\nretain an account of how causal explanations work and to simply\nsupplement it with a distinct account of how various kinds of\nnon-causal explanations arise (Pincock 2015a, Pincock 2018, with\ncriticisms from Knowles 2021a). This sort of explanatory pluralism is\nalso reminiscent of one aspect of the Aristotelian tradition. One\nchallenge for the explanatory pluralist is to make sense of the value\nthat scientists ascribe to explanations: how can there be some special\nvalue in having an explanation if explanations come in different kinds\nthat have nothing in common? One response to this challenge is that\ngrasping an explanation produces scientific understanding, but the\nnature and value of this scientific understanding remains a subject of\nactive debate (Rice & Rohwer 2021). Another response is to defend\na restrictive form of explanatory monism. It may turn out that this\nmonism about explanation is so restrictive that there are no\nmathematical explanations in science (Zelcer 2013, Kuorikoski 2021).\nThis is reminiscent of one side of the Renaissance debate noted in\nsection 1.1.\n\nAnother sort of pluralism arises from supposing that causal\nexplanations involve the mechanisms championed by the new mechanists,\nand then allowing for other sorts of explanations that work in\ndifferent ways. One type of case that has received extensive\ndiscussion is so-called \u201ctopological\u201d explanation. These\nexplanations appeal to structural or network-based features to explain\nan aspect of a system (Kostic 2020, 2023, Ross 2021). One position is\nthat topological explanations are non-causal, non-mechanical\nexplanations that are based on a different kind of explanatorily\nrelevant feature. For example, Kostic and Khalifa argue that a\nnon-ontic approach that privileges scientist\u2019s explanatory goals\nis needed to make sense of topological explanation (Kostic &\nKhalifa 2021, 2022). Another position is that an appropriately\nflexible notion of mechanism can count genuine topological\nexplanations as mechanical explanations (Bechtel & Abrahamsen\n2010, Bechtel 2020, Huneman 2010, 2018, Brigandt 2013, Green et al.\n2018). As with the debates arising from Woodward\u2019s and\nLewis\u2019 counterfactual approaches to causal explanation, the main\nquestion is what counts as a mechanism and how non-mechanisms can be\nexplanatory (Janson 2018, Janson & Saatsi 2019, Andersen 2020, Jha\net al. 2022).\n\nMore recently, some authors have tried to restore some kind of\nexplanatory monism by arguing that all scientific explanations turn on\nnon-representational, expressive elements (McCullough-Benner 2022,\nHunt forthcoming). If this was right, then there would be no\ndifficulty making sense of mathematical explanations so long as\nmathematics can be seen to perform whatever expressive function an\nauthor identifies. The viability of an expressive approach thus turns\non questions about the interpretation of pure mathematics that are\nconsidered in sections 1.4 and 2.2.\n1.3 Mathematical models and idealization\n\nOne assumption of the Aristotelian tradition that is often\nunquestioned in the work summarized in section 1.2 is that whatever\nprovides the explanation (i.e. the explanans) must be true.\nPhilosophical investigations of scientific models and how these models\nmay explain have convinced many that an explanans need not be true.\nThe argument for this conclusion is straightforward: Scientific models\nexplain and scientific models are not true. So, truth is not required\nfor explanation (Bokulich 2011; see also Cartwright 1983, Morrison\n2015, Rice 2018 and Yablo 2020).\n\nA traditional response to this argument is that even though models are\nnot true, a model can only explain if it generates some truths about\nthe target of explanation (Colyvan 2010, see section 1.4 for more\ndiscussion). That is, a model explains only when it represents its\ntarget to be a certain way. The debate thus turns on the options for\nmaking sense of how models represent, especially when those models are\nmathematical, and if the representational aspects of models are\nsufficient to make sense of model-based explanation. One proposal is\nthat a model explains when the model represents a target system to be\na certain way and also represents something else that explains why the\nsystem is that way. For example, a causal model of outcome \\(E\\) needs\nto represent \\(E\\) and some cause \\(C\\) of \\(E\\). However, there is no\nconsensus on what it takes for a model to represent something.\n\nAs a model is distinct from its target, and the model and target are\noften composed of different materials, it is natural to conclude that\nstructural relations are central to what a model represents. However,\nit is hard to maintain that a model represents a target just in case\nthere is a structural relation between the model and target\n(Su\u00e1rez 2010, 2015). For example, a model is isomorphic to\nitself, and so it stands in a structural relation to itself. But we do\nnot want to say that a model represents itself. There are also\nmodel-target relations that lack any clear structural\ncharacterization. For example, a model may represent the solar system,\nand yet contain only two point particles moving on trajectories that\nfail to stand in any non-trivial structural relation to anything in\nthe actual solar system. So it seems that standing in a structural\nrelation is neither necessary nor sufficient for a model to represent\na target.\n\nOne response to these problems is that a model represents a target\nwhen agents claim that a structural relation obtains between the model\nand the target, where that relation may be quite selective and involve\nreinterpretations of various elements of the model (Pincock 2012, ch.\n2, Frigg & Nguyen 2020). For example, the projection relating a\nmap to some country may be fairly complicated, and involve various\nconventions for what symbols on the map indicate about the country.\nSome authors associate the relations that agents establish between\nmodel and target with inferential principles (Bueno & Colyvan\n2011, Bueno & French 2018). So according to these various\nproposals, a model explains a feature of a target when either some\nrepresentational relationship or inferential licenses from model to\ntarget have been established by agents, and these connections\ngenuinely explain that feature (e.g. they are causes of the feature).\nFor example, a suitably interpreted map can explain the impossibility\nof train travel between two cities by accurately representing the\ntrain network that fails to link those cites.\n\nThe different approaches to explanation surveyed in section 1.2 can\nthen be used to identify explanatory models and what they explain. A\nmechanist about explanation can allow that mathematical models explain\nby representing mechanisms, while difference-making views will require\nan explanatory model to represent difference-making, i.e. how changing\nfactor \\(X\\) will go along with a change in outcome \\(Y\\). All of\nthese proposals will argue that scientific models do not need to be\ntrue in order to explain. All that needs to occur is for the model to\nprovide some truths by representing the right things about the target.\nSo the presence of falsehoods that the model also provides about the\ntarget does not stand in the way of the model\u2019s explanatory\npower.\n\nThis approach to explanatory models and idealization has been called\ninto question by Batterman. One argument from Batterman is that there\nare explanatory models that do not explain in virtue of an element of\nthe model representing some explanatorily relevant factor such as a\ncause or more exotic non-causal difference maker. Instead, in such\ncases, \u201cwhile we have a genuine mathematical explanation of\nphysical phenomena, there is no appeal to the existence of\nmathematical entities or their properties. Instead, the appeal is\nto a mathematical idealization resulting from a limit\noperation that relates one model \u2026 to another\u201d\n(2010, 7\u20138). The case that Batterman is discussing here involves\nan operation (known as taking the thermodynamic limit) that transforms\na \u201cfinite statistical mechanical model\u201d into a\n\u201ccontinuum thermodynamic model\u201d. This is central to the\nexplanation of the universality of some features of phase transitions\nthat include liquid/gas transitions and magnetization. The features\nare universal in the sense that they arise across systems with very\ndifferent microphysical features, and so seem especially puzzling.\n\nOne point that Batterman is making here is that mathematical\noperations that connect models can be significant for a mathematical\nexplanation of an empirical phenomena (see also Batterman & Rice\n2014, Batterman 2019, Batterman 2021). The defenders of traditional\napproaches to model explanation often focus on cases where a single\nmathematical structure is used to explain. However, the basic ideas of\nthe traditional approach can be extended to deal with the explanatory\nsignificance of some mathematical operations. For example, one\nmathematical model may be transformed into another mathematical model\nthrough a mathematical operation. If this operation reflects something\nof explanatory significance, then the two models and the operation\nconnecting them may be central to the explanation. Some idealizations\nare associated with these operations, as in the case where an ocean is\ntreated as infinitely deep or a planet is modeled as a point particle.\nIn such cases, the operations function by changing or removing the\ninterpretation of the elements of the model.\n\nBatterman also develops another point that poses a more significant\nchallenge to traditional approaches to model explanation. This is that\nthe \u201cmathematical idealization\u201d that results from this\noperation, and that is tied to one of these models, is essential to\nthe whole explanation. In the ocean case, there is no temptation to\nsay that the ocean being infinitely deep in one model is explanatorily\nrelevant to the character of the waves on the surface of the actual\nocean. All that this idealization turns on is that the depth is above\nsome threshold. Other cases can be handled using similar\n\u201cGalilean\u201d idealizations that eliminate the falsehood from\nthe genuine explanation (Weisberg 2007). But in Batterman\u2019s\ncases, such as the phase transition case, he is clear that he takes\nthe idealization to be essential to the explanation: \u201cThese\nnontraditional idealizations play essential explanatory roles\ninvolving operations or mathematical processes without\nrepresenting the system(s) in question\u201d (2010, 23). If this\npoint is accepted, then these cases would undermine the scope of the\ntraditional approach.\n\nIn the philosophy of physics there has been an extensive discussion of\nhow essential these idealizations are to the explanations in question\n(Belot 2005, Bokulich 2008, Norton 2012, Lange 2015a, Franklin 2018,\nSullivan 2019, Strevens 2019, Rodriguez 2021. See also Easwaran et al.\n2021). Some critics of Batterman have argued that these cases can be\ndealt with using explanations that avoid these idealizations or that\ntreat these idealizations in the manner that we treated the infinitely\ndeep ocean. Other critics of Batterman have argued that a more\nselective approach to what these models represent allows one to admit\nthat the idealizations are essential to generating the explanation,\nbut that they are not literally to be included in the explanation\nitself. For example, a counterfactual approach to these cases would\nidentify the explanation with some counterfactuals that are generated\nby the model. Batterman and others, in turn, have responded that all\nof these criticisms fail to do justice to the phenomena in question or\nwhat scientists say about their explanations (Morrison 2018, Batterman\n2019, McKenna 2021).\n\nOther alternatives to a traditional approach to mathematical modeling\nand explanation have been developed using other sorts of cases as\ntheir primary motivations (Rizza 2013, Berkovitz 2020, Kasirzadeh\n2021b, McKenna 2022). One theme of this work is a generalization of\nBatterman\u2019s point that scientific explanations often involve\nmany models whose representational relation to the explanatory target\nis more involved than what is usually allowed. For example, Kasirzadeh\nconsiders a case with two mathematical models, with different spatial\nscales, of a process of skin color pattern formation (Kasirzadeh\n2021b). Biologists asked for an explanation of how the two processes\nrelated to one another. Kasirzadeh argues that this explanation\nrequired additional \u201cbridge mathematics\u201d over and above\nthe mathematics found in the original two models. The additional\nmathematics contributed to the explanation by characterizing how the\nmicroscopic processes gave rise to the unexpected macroscopic\nstructures. McKenna goes further and argues for the importance of\ncases where \u201cmodels cannot be stitched together in purely\nmathematical terms\u201d (McKenna 2022). In McKenna\u2019s main case\nvarious models of sea ice permeability are developed for the purposes\nof large-scale climate modeling. No single mathematical model of sea\nice proved to be adequate to supply the right parameters to the\nlarge-scale model. Instead, different models of sea ice were used in\nconjunction with high-resolution empirical data about samples of sea\nice formations. The significance of these cases for the explanations\nthat arise from these modeling techniques is likely to be a subject of\nongoing debate.\n1.4 Explanatory indispensability arguments\n\nMany philosophers are interested in non-causal mathematical\nexplanations in science because they seem to support an explanatory\nindispensability argument for a platonist interpretation of pure\nmathematics. Colyvan and Baker have been the most ardent defenders of\nsuch an argument (Colyvan 2001, 2010, Baker 2005, 2009a, 2022). In his\n2001 book Colyvan presented a general indispensability argument for\nthe existence of mathematical entities like the natural numbers:\n\n1.\nWe ought to have ontological commitment to all and only those\nentities that are indispensable to our best scientific theories;\n2.\nMathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific\ntheories.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n3.\nWe ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities\n(Colyvan 2001, 11).\n\n\nThis notion of ontological commitment was first articulated by Quine\n(Quine 2004, Putnam 2010). These commitments reflect what one should\nbelieve exists. Premise 1 is tied to a naturalistic approach to these\nbeliefs that claims they should be determined by the character of our\nbest scientific theories. For Quine, one\u2019s ontological\ncommitments are settled by the best regimentation of one\u2019s\nscientific theories into first-order logic, where what makes a\nregimentation the best is determined by ordinary scientific criteria\nlike consistency and simplicity. Some of Colyvan\u2019s cases in his\nbook invoked the explanatory contribution that mathematical entities\nmake to our best theories. If we suppose that one aim of science is to\nexplain, then a regimentation may be the best in part because it\naffords explanations of various scientific phenomena.\n\nAn explanatory version of this indispensability argument became more\nprominent after Melia\u2019s exchange with Colyvan (Melia 2000, 2002,\nColyvan 2002). Melia argued that indispensable quantification over\nmathematical entities was not sufficient for ontological commitment.\nAny such commitments could be canceled by a \u201cweaseling\u201d\nmaneuver that added \u201cbut I do not accept the existence of any\nmathematical entities.\u201d For example, one could use numbers to\ncount how many apples and pears one has and conclude that there are\nmore apples than pears. But Melia would then add that he rejected the\nexistence of natural numbers, thereby canceling that commitment.\nColyvan replied that such an addition was incoherent when the\nmathematical entities were explaining something, and Melia agreed:\n\u201cWere there clear examples where the postulation of mathematical\nobjects results in an increase in the same kind of utility as that\nprovided by the postulation of theoretical entities, then it would\nseem that the same kind of considerations that support the existence\nof atoms, electrons and space-time equally supports the existence of\nnumbers, functions and sets\u201d (Melia 2002, 75\u201376). The\ndebate about indispensability and platonism then largely turned to the\nevaluation of cases. \n\nBaker took up Melia\u2019s challenge by reformulating the argument so\nthat the explanatory question became central. Baker also introduced\nnew cases like the cicada case where the parallel between atoms and\nnumbers was meant to be clearer. In Baker\u2019s formulation, the\nargument is:\n\n1\u2032.\n We ought rationally to believe in the existence of any entity\nthat plays an indispensable explanatory role in our best scientific\ntheories.\n2\u2032.\n Mathematical objects play an indispensable explanatory role in\nscience.\n3\u2032.\n Hence, we ought rationally to believe in the existence of\nmathematical objects (Baker 2009a, 613, premises renumbered).\n\n\nThe emphasis on explanation in premise 1\u2032 is of course\nconsistent with Quine\u2019s process of regimentation. For example,\nwe opt for the theory of cicadas that best explains their character.\nIf we then work out the best regimentation of this theory, we will\nfind that it will entail that prime numbers exist. All premise\n1\u2032 maintains, then, is that one should endorse whatever these\nontological commitments turn out to be. However, a second way to\nsupport premise 1\u2032 is available: one could appeal to inference\nto the best explanation and its use to support scientific realism\nabout unobservable entities like electrons. Baker sometimes ties the\nappeal of his indispensability argument to scientific realism:\n\u201cA crucial plank of the scientific realist position involves\ninference to the best explanation (IBE) to justify the postulation in\nparticular cases of unobservable theoretical entities \u2026 the\nindispensability debate only gets off the ground if both sides take\nIBE seriously, which suggests that explanation is of key importance in\nthis debate\u201d (Baker 2005, 225). The appeal to IBE avoids the\nQuinean process of regimentation by directing our attention to some\nexplanatory target such as the length of the life-cycles of some\nspecies of cicada. If we are scientific realists, then we accept the\nuse of IBE in support of our claims about the existence of various\nentities. So if we find that the best explanation also includes\nabstract objects like prime numbers, then we should also accept their\nexistence.\n\nThree worries about this explanatory indispensability argument can be\nfruitfully distinguished. The first worry is that the argument is\nsomehow circular, begs the question or else fails to correctly\nidentify the basis for our knowledge of the existence of mathematical\nentities. The point was forcefully presented by Steiner in 1978.\nSteiner argues for the existence of mathematical explanations and also\nclaims to know of the existence of abstract, mathematical entities.\nHowever, \u201cno explanatory argument can establish the existence of\nmathematical entities\u201d (1978b, 20). The reason for this is\nattributed to Morgenbesser: \u201cWe cannot say what the world would\nbe like without numbers, because describing any thinkable experience\n(except for utter emptiness) presupposes their existence\u201d\n(1978b, 19\u201320). The point seems to be that we must be able to\ncompare mathematical and non-mathematical explanations of some target\nin order to get an explanatory argument going. But if the target\nalways \u201cpresupposes\u201d the existence of some mathematical\nentities, then this comparison is not possible. Bangu has developed\nthis point by noting how many of the cases discussed have targets that\nare mathematical in character, as with the prime periods of the\ncicadas (Bangu 2008, 2012, see Baker 2021a for a response). So, the\nworry continues, mathematical explanations are only indispensable in\nscience if we have used mathematical entities to characterize the\ntarget phenomena. Pincock has a somewhat similar concern: if the\ntargets are characterized in weak mathematical terms, then only weak\nmathematical theories will be needed to explain these targets, and\nthese theories can be easily supplied with a nominalistic\ninterpretation that preserves these theories\u2019 explanatory power\n(Pincock 2012, see Baker 2015b for a reply to these worries).\n\nAnother worry accepts that there are in some sense mathematical\nexplanations in science. However, premise 2\u2032 is rejected because\nthese explanations fail to involve the existence of any mathematical\nobjects. Saatsi has developed this criticism by claiming that\nmathematics only explains by representing some non-mathematical\nfeatures of the physical world (Saatsi 2007, 2011). On this reading,\npremise 2\u2032 requires the existence of some\n\u201cdistinctively\u201d or \u201cgenuinely\u201d mathematical\nexplanations, but there are no such explanations. As Saatsi puts the\nworry, \u201cwhat really matters for the indispensability argument\n\u2013 all that matters! \u2013 is whether or not mathematics plays\nthe kind of explanatory role that we should take as ontologically\ncommitting\u201d (Saatsi 2016, 1051). Until the defenders of the\nargument clarify what distinctively mathematical explanations are and\nhow they involve mathematical objects, it seems that premise 2\u2032\nis in trouble. Other versions of this objection may be found in Daly\n& Langford 2009, Rizza 2011, Tallant 2013, Liggins 2016, Busch\n& Morrison 2016, Barrantes 2019 and Boyce 2021 (see also Panza\n& Sereni 2016 for a helpful overview of these debates).\n\nA third kind of worry about premise 2\u2032 is developed by\nmathematical fictionalists like Yablo and Leng (Leng 2010, 2021, Yablo\n2012, 2020). Fictionalists accept the existence of distinctively\nmathematical explanations and yet argue that these explanations do not\npresuppose the existence of any mathematical objects. For example,\nLeng argues that \u201cwe can generate mathematical explanations of\nphysical phenomena that do not appeal to any abstract mathematical\nobjects, but instead only require modal truths about what follows\nlogically from our mathematical assumptions, together with the\nrecognition that the assumptions of our mathematical theories are true\nwhen interpreted as about the physical system under examination\u201d\n(Leng 2021, 10437). Leng can thus endorse the very same unified\nderivation of the features of Baker\u2019s cicadas, and yet refrain\nfrom accepting the existence of mathematical objects. While Saatsi\ntakes the physical features of the system to be the genuine\nexplainers, Leng uses those same features to interpret the\nmathematical theories that are doing the explanatory work. Either way,\npremise 2\u2032 of the indispensability argument comes out false.\n\nColyvan and Baker\u2019s strategy for supporting premise 2\u2032 has\nlargely involved cases where it appears that mathematical objects play\na role in the explanation that is analogous to what unobservable\nentities like electrons play in other explanations. For example, in\nthe cicada case, the prime numbers afford a unified derivation of the\ntarget of the explanation. This strategy would be most effective\nagainst representational approaches to mathematical explanation. The\nbasic idea is that scientists value these explanations, and so any\nreinterpretation of them in non-mathematical terms risks privileging\nan unmotivated philosophical theory over some legitimate scientific\npractice. As Baker and Colyvan put the point in a reply directed at\nDaly and Langford (2009): \u201cCommitments to philosophical theories\nsuch as nominalism, a causal theory of explanation, or the\n\u2018indexing\u2019 view of mathematical applications are not good\nreasons for rejecting well-supported scientific and mathematical\nclaims\u201d (Baker & Colyvan 2011, 332).\n\nA second strategy that Colyvan has pursued is to challenge critics to\nrecast these explanations in non-mathematical terms. The refusal to do\nthis involves an \u201ceasy road\u201d to nominalism that Colyvan\nthinks is untenable: \u201cwhen some piece of language is delivering\nan explanation, either that piece of language must be interpreted\nliterally or the non-literal reading of the language in question\nstands proxy for the real explanation\u201d (Colyvan 2010, 300). This\nstrategy is most effective against fictionalists. It involves a\nconception of scientific explanation that requires that every genuine\nexplanation be presentable in literal, non-metaphorical language: to\nsay why something is the case, we must literally say what is\nresponsible for what, and so it must be in principle possible to avoid\nfictional or metaphorical tools. If fictionalists are right about pure\nmathematics, then mathematics is simply such a tool, and so they\nshould be able to sketch a non-mathematical version of the\nexplanations at issue. The fictionalist response is to deny this\nconception of explanation.\n\nYet another kind of criticism of premise 2\u2032 accepts both the\nexistence of mathematical explanations and that these explanations\ninvolve mathematical objects, but maintains that these explanations\nare dispensable from our best science. That is, either the best\nregimentation of our scientific theories will avoid quantification\nover mathematical objects or no appeal to IBE will actually support\nadopting such an explanation. This sort of criticism can be traced\nback to Field\u2019s pioneering Science without numbers\n(Field 1980). There Field contrasts \u201cintrinsic\u201d\nexplanations with \u201cextrinsic\u201d explanations. He claims that\nall mathematical explanations are extrinsic and that for every\nextrinsic explanation of some target, there is a superior, intrinsic\nexplanation of that very target (Field 1980, 43\u201344; see Marcus\n2013). The explanations championed by Colyvan, Baker and others\nsuggest that it is not clear that a mathematical explanation is always\nextrinsic or that a non-mathematical explanation that is intrinsic is\nsuperior in all respects. Consider again the non-causal explanation of\nthe impossibility of traversing the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg or the\nevolutionary explanation of the prime periods of the cicada. While\nsome non-mathematical derivation of these targets is surely available,\nthis does not settle whether or not these derivations should count as\nexplanations or what their explanatory virtues might be.\n\nPerhaps the most promising defense of premise 2\u2032 would be to\nprovide a positive account of distinctively mathematical explanations\nthat would clarify how endorsing such explanations commits one to the\nexistence of some mathematical objects. The recent literature on this\nissue again seems to lead to a kind of standoff. Consider, for\nexample, Baron\u2019s \u201cPythagorean\u201d proposal for these\nexplanations (Baron forthcoming). Baron defines a Pythagorean to be\nsomeone who not only believes in mathematical objects as abstract\nentities, but who claims that some of the intrinsic properties of\nthese abstract entities are also possessed by concrete entities. This\nis possible because the salient intrinsic properties of the\nmathematical entities are structural properties that are found in the\nconcrete world whenever the concrete entities are arranged in the\nright structure. These shared, structural properties and their\nnecessary mathematical relations thus enable mathematical truths to\nexplain features of physical systems such as the bridges or cicadas.\nIn addition, Baron is clear that \u201cStructural properties on my\naccount make indispensable reference to abstract objects\u201d (Baron\nforthcoming, 25). So one defense of premise 2\u2032 involves adopting\nBaron\u2019s Pythagoreanism.\n\nOther accounts of distinctively mathematical explanation support the\nrejection of premise 2\u2032. For example, Lange\u2019s modal\ninterpretation of distinctively mathematical explanations leads him to\nendorse what he calls an \u201cAristotelian realist\u201d\ninterpretation of pure mathematics in terms of a special kind of\nabstract property, without the recourse to any abstract objects (Lange\n2021b, see also Franklin 2008). According to Lange, the best way to\nmake sense of the explanatory power of mathematical truths is to\nsuppose that \u201cmathematics concerns mathematical properties\npossessed by physical systems\u201d (Lange 2021b, 50). As with Baron,\nthese mathematical properties can help to explain why these physical\nsystems have some other properties. For Lange the main benefit of such\nan Aristotelian interpretation is that the salient modal features of\nthe physical systems arise from the presence of the mathematical\nproperties. This helps to clarify in what sense the mathematical truth\nand the properties it invokes may be explanatorily prior to some\ntarget property. Crucially, though, for Lange this interpretation of\npure mathematics eliminates the need to invoke abstract objects. If\nLange is right, then, premise 2\u2032 of the explanatory\nindispensability argument is false. (See also Knowles & Saatsi\n2021, Knowles 2021a, Knowles 2021b and Baker 2022 on additional\nchallenges to this premise.)\n\nOne diagnosis of the problems with indispensability arguments is that\nthe conclusion of the argument concerns the interpretation of pure\nmathematics while the premises of the argument consider how\nmathematics is used in science. Perhaps, then, a platonist would be\nbetter served by focusing on explanatory considerations that arise\nwithin the practice of pure mathematics. This is the focus of section\n2.\n2. Mathematical explanation in mathematics\n\nMuch mathematical activity is driven by factors other than\nestablishing that a certain theorem is true. In many cases\nmathematicians are unsatisfied by merely knowing that a mathematical\nfact holds and reprove it, while also claiming explanatory benefits\nfor the new proof. This type of explanatory activity appears within\nmathematics itself (see the Preamble) and thus one often speaks of\n\u201cinternal\u201d or \u201cintra-mathematical\nexplanations\u201d (Baron, Colyvan & Ripley 2020, Betti 2010,\nMancosu 2008). The expression \u201cinternal mathematical\nexplanation\u201d covers a wide range of different phenomena: an\ninternal mathematical explanation could amount to the recasting of an\nentire area of mathematics or it might aim at providing explanatory\nproofs for specific theorems. The variety of these mathematical\nexplanatory activities has been investigated in D\u2019Alessandro (2020),\nHafner and Mancosu (2005), Lange (2018b), and Sandborg (1997, Ch.\n1).\n\nAmongst these different explanatory activities, most of the attention\nhas been focused on proofs which not only prove that a\ntheorem is true, but also show why it is true. While there\nmight not be agreement on specific instances, many mathematicians\noften claim that certain proofs have an explanatory power and that\nothers do not. These claims are found throughout the history of\nmathematics and the philosophy of mathematics (see Lange 2015c, 2016,\n2017 (Ch. 7\u20139) and Mancosu 2001). In the words of Bouligand:\n\nMany theorems can be given different demonstrations. The most\ninstructive are of course those that let one understand the deep\nreasons of the results that one is establishing. (Bouligand, 1932, 6,\nMancosu\u2019s translation)\n\n\nAnd the real algebraic geometer Gregory Brumfiel draws a stark\ncontrast between two different types of proofs to be found in real\nalgebraic geometry, i.e., what he calls transcendental proofs (i.e.,\nproofs based on transfer theorems that infer the truth of a statement\nfor all real closed fields from its truth on a specific real closed\nfield, say the real numbers) vs. a type of proof that holds uniformly\nfor all real closed fields. The first type of proof is rejected by\nBrumfiel as non-explanatory and, by contrast, the latter provide\nexplanatory benefits. In his words:\n\nIn this book we absolutely and unequivocally refuse to give proofs of\nthis [\u2026] type [transcendental proofs]. Every result is proved\nuniformly for all real closed ground fields. Our philosophical\nobjection to transcendental proofs is that they might logically prove\na result, but they do not explain it, except for the special case of\nreal numbers. (Brumfiel 1979, 166)\n\n\nAs the previous examples show, explanatory proofs could be of several\ntypes and explain in different manners. A recent debate has focused on\nthe issue of whether proofs by induction are explanatory. On the one\nhand, Lange (2010) argues that proofs by induction are not\nexplanatory. His argument relies on the use of a form of upward and\ndownward induction from a fixed number k, with k\u22601. According to\nLange, if proofs by ordinary mathematical induction are explanatory,\nso are proofs by upward and downward induction from a fixed number k,\nwith k\u22601. But if so, then the typical asymmetry of explanations,\nwhich also holds of mathematical explanations, is not respected: for a\ncertain property P, P(1) is part of the explanation of P(k) and P(k)\nis part of the explanation of P(1). Baker (2009b) rejects\nLange\u2019s argument by arguing against the explanatory equivalence\nbetween proofs by ordinary mathematical induction and proofs by upward\nand downward induction. Hoeltje et al. (2013) reject what they see as\nan unacknowledged assumption in Lange\u2019s argument, namely that a\nuniversal sentence explains its instances. Dougherty (2017)\u2019s\nline of attack is based on Lange\u2019s need to presuppose a\nproblematic notion of identity of proofs, which he questions using an\nalternative criterion of identity spelled out using two equivalent\ncharacterizations (the first appealing to the language of homotopy\ntype theory and the second using algebraic representatives to proofs).\nBoth Baldwin (2016) and Lehet (2019) defend the explanatory value of\ninduction in mathematics: while Baldwin offers positive considerations\nas to why inductive arguments are explanatory, Lehet dwells on\ninductive definitions which \u2013 she argues \u2013 might be cases\nof explanations in mathematics.\n\nThe distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory proofs has\nalso been applied to other types of proofs, for instance proofs that\nexplain by using diagrams (see D\u2019Alessandro 2020, Brown 1997),\nor proofs that explain by drawing on analogies (see Lange 2017).\nSignificant philosophical activity has focused on those proofs that\nexplain by revealing the reasons, or the grounds, why a theorem is\ntrue. As stressed by Lange (2021c), in this context the word\n\u201cground\u201d should not be understood as connected to the\nrecent literature on metaphysical grounding (e.g., see Correia and\nSchnieder (2002)). We should rather think of the notion of\n\u201cconceptual grounding\u201d, as developed by, e.g. Smithson\n(2020). This notion of ground has an illustrious pedigree in\nphilosophers and mathematicians such as Bolzano (see Kitcher 1975,\nMancosu 1999 and Sebestik 1992) or Cournot (see Mancosu 1999), and\nrecent contributions have stressed its value in the mathematical realm\n(see Betti 2010, Detlefsen 1988, Jansson 2017, Pincock 2015b,\nPoggiolesi and Genco 2023). Indeed, just as in the scientific\nliterature it is widely accepted that causal explanations track a\ncausal relation in the world and explain by revealing the causes of\nwhy a certain fact holds, it seems reasonable to accept that (at least\ncertain) mathematical explanatory proofs track a grounding relation in\nthe mathematical realm and thus explain by mentioning the grounds or\nreasons why a theorem is true.\n2.1 Some historical remarks\n\nSince contributions in analytic philosophy to the study of\nmathematical explanations date back only to Steiner 1978a, one might\nsuspect that the topic was a byproduct of the Quinean conception of\nscientific theories (see Resnik & Kushner, 1987, 154). Once\nmathematics and natural science were placed on the same footing, it\nbecame possible to apply a unified methodology to both areas. Thus, it\nmade sense to look for explanations in mathematics just as in natural\nscience. However, this historical reconstruction would be mistaken.\nMathematical explanations of mathematical facts have been part of\nphilosophical reflection since Aristotle. We have already seen in\nsection 1.1 the distinction Aristotle drew between demonstrations\n\u201cof the fact\u201d and demonstrations \u201cof the reasoned\nfact\u201d. Both are logically rigorous but only the latter provide\nexplanations for their results. Aristotle had also claimed that\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d occur in\nmathematics. Only these demonstrations can be called\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d demonstrations, and some of these\ndemonstrations will be mathematical proofs.\n\nAristotle\u2019s position on explanatory proofs in mathematics was\nalready challenged in ancient times. Proclus, in his \u201cCommentary\non the first book of Euclid\u2019s Elements\u201d, informs us on\nthis point. He reports: \u201cMany persons have thought that geometry\ndoes not investigate the cause, that is, does not ask the question\n\u2018Why?\u2019\u201d (Proclus 1970, 158\u2013159; for more on\nProclus on mathematical explanation see Harari 2008). Proclus himself\nsingles out certain propositions in Euclid\u2019s\n\u201cElements\u201d, such as I.32, as not being demonstrations\n\u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. Euclid I.32 states that the sum of\nthe internal angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles. If the\ndemonstration were given by a scientific syllogism in the Aristotelean\nsense, the middle of the syllogism would have to provide the\n\u2018cause\u2019 of the fact. But Proclus argues that\nEuclid\u2019s proof does not satisfy these Aristotelian constraints,\nfor the appeal to the auxiliary lines and exterior angles is not\n\u2018causal\u2019:\n\nWhat is called \u201cproof\u201d we shall find sometimes has the\nproperties of a demonstration in being able to establish what is\nsought by means of definitions as middle terms, and this is the\nperfect form of demonstration; but sometimes it attempts to prove by\nmeans of signs. This point should not be overlooked. Although\ngeometrical propositions always derive their necessity from the matter\nunder investigation, they do not always reach their results through\ndemonstrative methods. For example, when [from] the fact that the\nexterior angle of a triangle is equal to the two opposite interior\nangles it is shown that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle\nis equal to two right angles, how can this be called a demonstration\nbased on the cause? Is not the middle term used here only as a sign?\nFor even though there be no exterior angle, the interior angles are\nequal to two right angles; for it is a triangle even if its side is\nnot extended. (Proclus 1970, 161\u20132)\n\n\nIn addition, Proclus also held that proofs by contradiction were not\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. The rediscovery of\nProclus in the Renaissance was to spark a far-reaching debate on the\ncausality of mathematical demonstrations referred to above as the\nQuaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum (see section 1.1 for more on\nthis debate). The first shot was fired by Alessandro Piccolomini in\n1547. Piccolomini\u2019s aim was to disarm a traditional claim to the\neffect that mathematics derives its certainty on account of its use of\n\u201cscientific demonstrations\u201d in the Aristotelean sense\n(such proofs were known as \u201cpotissimae\u201d in the\nRenaissance). Since \u201cpotissimae\u201d demonstrations had to be\ncausal, Piccolomini attacked the argument by arguing that mathematical\ndemonstrations are not causal. This led to one of the most interesting\nepistemological debates of the Renaissance and the seventeenth\ncentury. Those denying the \u201ccausality\u201d of mathematical\ndemonstrations (Piccolomini, Pereyra, Gassendi etc.) argued by\nproviding specific examples of demonstrations from mathematical\npractice (usually from Euclid\u2019s Elements) which, they claimed,\ncould not be reconstructed as causal reasonings in the Aristotelian\nsense. By contrast, those hoping to restore \u201ccausality\u201d to\nmathematics aimed at showing that the alleged counterexamples could\neasily be accommodated within the realm of \u201ccausal\u201d\ndemonstrations (Clavius, Barrow, etc.). Interestingly, both positions\nin the debate assumed that mathematical proofs could be syllogized\n(Mancosu & Mugnai 2023). The historical developments have been\npresented in detail in Mancosu 1996 and Mancosu 2000.\n\nWhat is more important here is to appreciate that the basic intuition\n\u2013 the contraposition between explanatory and non-explanatory\ndemonstrations \u2013 had a long and successful history that has\ninfluenced both mathematical and philosophical developments well\nbeyond the seventeenth century. For instance, Mancosu 1999 shows that\nBolzano and Cournot, two major philosophers of mathematics in the\nnineteenth century, construe the central problem of philosophy of\nmathematics as that of accounting for the distinction between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations. In the case of Bolzano\nthis takes the form of a theory of Grund (ground) and Folge\n(consequence). Kitcher 1975 was the first to read Bolzano as\npropounding a theory of mathematical explanations (see Betti 2010 and\nRoski 2017 for recent contributions). In the case of Cournot this is\nspelled out in terms of the opposition between \u201cordre\nlogique\u201d and \u201cordre rationelle\u201d (see Cournot 1851).\nIn Bolzano\u2019s case, the aim of providing a reconstruction of\nparts of analysis and geometry, so that the exposition would use only\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d proofs, also led to major mathematical\nresults, such as his purely analytic proof of the intermediate value\ntheorem.\n\nIn conclusion to this section, we should also point out that there is\nanother tradition of thinking of explanation in mathematics that\nincludes Mill, Lakatos, Russell and G\u00f6del. These authors are\nmotivated by a conception of mathematics (and/or its foundations) as\nhypothetico-deductive in nature and this leads them to construe\nmathematical activity in analogy with how explanatory hypotheses occur\nin science (see Mancosu 2001 for more details). Related to inductivism\nare Cellucci 2008, 2017, which emphasize the connection between\nmathematical explanation and discovery.\n2.2 Models of mathematical explanation\n\nFrom the above, it should be obvious that both philosophers and\nmathematicians have appealed to the notion of explanation within\nmathematics and that amongst the different contexts in which such\nexplanatory activity appears, proofs play a special role. But what\ndistinguishes a proof that explains from one that doesn\u2019t? How\nshould one proceed in providing an account of explanatory proofs? It\nis here that two possibilities emerge. On the one hand, one can follow\na top-down approach where one starts with a general model of\nexplanatory proof and then tries to see how well it accounts for the\npractice. On the other hand, one can embrace a bottom-up approach\nwhere one begins by avoiding, as much as possible, any commitment to a\nparticular theoretical framework. Only afterwards, one attempts to\nprovide a taxonomy of recurrent types of mathematical explanatory\nproofs and tries to see whether these patterns are heterogeneous or\ncan be subsumed under a general account.\n\nSupporters of the bottom-up approach include Hafner and Mancosu\n(2005), Mancosu (2008) and Lange (2015b, 2015c, 2017, 2018b). Probably\nthe main characteristic of their investigations is the extremely rich\nand varied set of examples considered; precisely in virtue of this\nvariety, Lange argues that there is no general pattern characterizing\nexplanatory proofs; at most one can claim that there are different\nclasses of explanatory proofs. Lange proposes several salient features\nof mathematical theorems, which (in different contexts) are\nresponsible (in those contexts) for the distinction between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory proofs. Among them, he discusses\nextensively symmetry and simplicity. As for simplicity, it amounts to\nthe requirement for a proof of a simple result \u201cexploits some\nsimilar, simple feature of the setup\u201d (see Lange 2017, 257). As\nfor symmetry, it is a property that arises when dealing with\nmathematical results that display some striking symmetry: for the\nproof to count as explanatory, it needs to show how such symmetry\nfollows from a similar symmetry in the set-up of the problem. Lange\ndefends these properties by using cases studies drawn from\nprobability, real analysis, number theory, complex numbers and\ngeometry, among other areas of mathematics. One of the most\nrepresentative (see Lange 2017, 239\u2013242) is the proof of\nd\u2019Alembert\u2019s theorem to the effect that in a polynomial\nequation of n-th degree in the variable x and having\nonly real coefficients, the nonreal roots always come in pairs (any\nnon-real root and its complex conjugate will both satisfy the\nequation). What explains this symmetry? A non-explanatory proof can be\ngiven by algebraic manipulations but this does not reveal the reason\nfor the result which, according to Lange, is the fact that the axioms\nof complex arithmetic are invariant under substitution of i\nfor -i. Bueno and Vivanco (2019) points out that it is\nunclear why what Lange isolates as the symmetric feature of the proof\n(which makes it explanatory) is a symmetry at all. They suggest that\nthis proof turns on an appropriate feature of the relevant\nstructure.\n\nOther instances of the bottom-up approach may be found in Paseau\n(2010), Arana & Mancosu (2012), Colyvan, Cusberg & McQueen\n(2018), D\u2019Alessandro (2021) and Ryan (2021). Each article\nconsiders an aspect of mathematical practice and tries to address it\non its own terms.\n\nTop-down approaches take their start from a general theory of\nmathematical explanation and then explore how well the practice fits\nthe model. A typical example of a top-down approach in mathematical\nexplanation is Kitcher\u2019s unificationist theory, to be discussed\nbelow. But one can also apply this description to overarching views on\nthe nature of explanation. While there are several examples one could\nmention, here we present an influential proposal that finds its origin\nin Kim (1994). In order to classify the different accounts of\nscientific explanation Kim uses the contraposition between\n\u2018explanatory internalism\u2019 and \u2018explanatory\nexternalism.\u2019 Whereas for \u2018explanatory internalism\u2019\nexplanations are activities internal to an epistemic corpus (a theory\nor set of beliefs), an \u2018explanatory externalist\u2019 will look\nfor some systematic pattern of objective dependence relations which\nexplanations track or can be identified with. We divide the present\nsection in two subsections that follow this division: one will be\ndedicated to the presentation of the externalist, or ontic, accounts\nof explanatory mathematical proofs, while the other to the\ninternalist, or epistemic, ones. Among the externalist accounts, we\nwill discuss Steiner\u2019s theory, several counterfactual theories\nof mathematical explanation, and some other proposals. Among\ninternalist accounts we will discuss Kitcher\u2019s theory, together\nwith two novel ones proposed by Frans (2021) and Inglis &\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos (2019).\n2.2.1 Externalist models of mathematical explanation\n\nAmongst the several existing contemporary externalist models of\nexplanatory proofs, the oldest and probably most well-known is\nSteiner\u2019s account. Steiner aims at finding criteria that could\ncharacterize explanatory proofs. After having discussed several\npossible criteria, such as abstractness, generality, and\nvisualizability, Steiner rejects them all in favor of the idea that\n\u201cto explain the behavior of an entity, one deduces the behavior\nfrom the essence or nature of the entity\u201d (Steiner 1978a, 143).\nAlthough such an idea could seem prima facie intuitive and\ninteresting, it turns out to be quite problematic. First, it leads to\nthe notorious difficulties linked to the concepts of essence or\nessential property; moreover, such concepts risk having little\ntraction in a mathematical context since all mathematical truths are\nregarded as necessary. Hence, instead of talking of\n\u201cessence,\u201d Steiner speaks of \u201ccharacterizing\nproperties\u201d by which he means \u201ca property unique to a\ngiven entity or structure within a family or domain of such entities\nor structures,\u201d where he takes the notion of a family as\nundefined. In other words, for Steiner the difference between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory proofs lies in the characterizing\nproperties, which are found only in the former but not by the latter.\nHowever, this is not all: an explanatory proof needs to be\ngeneralizable as well. Varying the relevant feature (and hence a\ncertain characterizing property) in such a proof needs to give rise to\nan array of corresponding theorems, which are proved \u2013 and\nexplained \u2013 by an array of \u201cdeformations\u201d of the\noriginal proof.\n\nThere have been two extensive critical discussions of Steiner\u2019s\naccount. The first was provided by Resnik and Kushner (1987) who\nargued that the distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory\nproofs is context-dependent. The second, which also offers a\ncounterexample to the theory based on a case of explanation from real\nanalysis recognized as such in mathematical practice, has been\ndeveloped by Hafner and Mancosu (2005). There have also been attempts\nto improve Steiner\u2019s model. The work developed by Weber and\nVerhoeven (2002) can for example be seen as an attempt to improve\nSteiner\u2019s notion of deformation. Indeed, while Steiner suggests\nthat explanation concerns an array of related proofs and theorems,\nalthough maintaining that each proof is an explanation of the\nindividual theorem, Weber and Verhoeven (2002) start with what makes\npairs of proofs \u2013 P1 and P2 \u2013 count as explanatory. In\nparticular, they focus on explaining why, while a certain class of\nobject \\(x\\) has a property \\(Q\\) (proof P1), another class of objects\n\\(y\\) enjoys property Q\u2019 (proof P2). Here P1 and P2 use the same\naxioms and the same logical rules, but while P1 uses a characterizing\nproperty of \\(x\\), but not of \\(y\\), P2 uses a characterizing property\nof \\(y\\), but not of \\(x\\). A final attempt to enrich Steiner\u2019s\naccount is proposed by Salverda (2017) who tries to adapt this\napproach to an internalist perspective on explanations of the sort\ndiscussed in section 2.2.2.\n\nIn the field of causal explanations, a dominant perspective has been\nformulated in counterfactual terms. Although there has long been a\nresistance in the use of counterfactuals to account for explanations\nin mathematics (see Lange 2017, 88, 2022), many authors adopt this\napproach, perhaps due to the attractiveness of a unified theory of\nexplanation that promises to hold in both causal and non-causal\ncontexts. \n\nAccording to a counterfactual account, the evaluation of whether a\nmathematical fact \\(F\\) explains another mathematical fact \\(G\\) boils\ndown to the evaluation of the following two counterfactuals:\n\nCF1:\n if \\(F\\) had not been the case, \\(G\\) would not have been the\ncase,\n\n\nCF2:\n if \\(G\\) had not been the case, \\(F\\) would not have been the\ncase.\n\n\nThe first counterfactual, CF1, needs to be true: it directly accounts\nfor the explanatory power of the relation between \\(F\\) and \\(G\\). By\ncontrast, the second counterfactual, CF2, needs to be false since it\nserves to ensure that the relation between \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is\nasymmetric, i.e., it shows that it is not the case that \\(G\\) explains\n\\(F\\).\n\nOnce the counterfactuals are specified, a theory for counterfactuals\nneeds to make clear what truth-conditional account of counterfactuals\nis adopted. Here (at least) two options naturally emerge. On the one\nhand, one can evaluate a counterfactual using possible worlds\nsemantics; for example, Lewis\u2019s closeness-based semantics, which\ntrivializes for mathematical counterfactuals (see Lewis 1973, and\nStalnaker 1968), has recently been extended to avoid these\ntrivialities (see for example Nolan 2001 and Priest 2002). This\nextension, which considers both possible and impossible words, can be\nused to evaluate the truth value of counterfactuals CF1 and CF2. On\nthe other hand, one can also try to adapt the standard tools of\nstructural equation modelling (see Pearl 2000) to evaluate the truth\nvalue of CF1 and CF2. In this case, one interprets mathematical facts\nas variables which can either take the value 1 or the value 0,\naccording to whether the propositions they represent are either true\nor false. While the variable that denotes \\(F\\) is an\nexogenous variable \u2013 its values are determined by\nfactors outside the model \u2013 the variable that denotes \\(G\\) is\nendogenous \u2013 its values are determined by the value of\nother variable(s), in our case \\(F\\). In order to test whether the\ncounterfactual CF1 is true, one needs to intervene on the\nvalue of the variable assigned to \\(F\\) and check whether this change\naffects the value of the variable assigned to \\(G\\). As for the truth\nvalue of CF2, its falsity, and thus the asymmetry required by the\nexplanatory relation, is built into the nature of endogenous\nvariable.\n\nBoth Reutlinger et al. (2022) and Baron et al. (2020) support a\ncounterfactual theory of explanation that is mainly discussed in the\npossible worlds\u2019 semantics framework. More precisely, while\nReutlinger et al. defends the value of a monist theory of explanation,\nBaron et al. (2020) exemplify the counterfactual approach to\nmathematical explanations with a real case of explanatory proof.\n\nGijsbers (2017) develops a counterfactual account of explanatory\nproofs which relies on the structural equation framework, but where\nthe notion of \u201cintervention\u201d \u00e0 la Woodward (2003),\ncannot be employed in the mathematical context. As Woodward\nemphasizes, an intervention is a causal change to the value of a\nvariable. Instead Gijsbers introduces the idea of a\n\u201cquasi-interventionist\u201d theory of mathematical\nexplanation: in this theory, quasi-interventions reveal asymmetries\nwhich are inherent not in the mathematical proofs, but in the\nmathematical practice (see Gijsbers, 2017, 59). In other words,\nasymmetries are no longer accounted for in an objective, but rather in\na more subjective way that is tied to the features of the practice in\nquestion.\n\nIn a sense Gijsbers\u2019 model is complementary to the one proposed\nby Frans and Weber (2014). Indeed, while Gijsbers accounts for the\nexplanatory power of proofs in counterfactual terms, without using the\nnotion of intervention, Frans and Weber account for the explanatory\npower of proofs with a mechanistic model of explanation that directly\ngeneralizes on Woodward\u2019s notion of an intervention.\n\nThe use of counterfactuals to model mathematical explanations has been\ncriticized by Kasirzadeh (2021) and Lange (2022). While Kasirzadeh\nquestions whether the explanans of an explanatory proof can be\nmeaningfully varied in a mathematical context, as the counterfactual\naccounts would require, Lange argues instead that the counterfactual\naccount is rather threatened by the existence of too many\nnon-trivially true countermathematicals. Both Kasirzadeh and Lange\nemphasize that the capacity to answer\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions does not correlate with\nexplanatory power in mathematics. Finally, note that also in Jansson\n(2018) one might find criticisms on the use of the structural\nequations\u2019 framework to model dependence relations other than\ncausation, and thus arguably also dependence relations in a\nmathematical context.\n\nNot all externalist models for mathematical explanations are\nmodifications of Steiner\u2019s theory or conveyed in counterfactual\nterms. Pincock (2015b) for example proposes to classify a proof as\nexplanatory when it invokes more abstract kind of entities than the\ntopic of the theorem it proves. Wilhelm (2021) and Poggiolesi\n(forthcoming) contain different proposals for the analysis of\nexplanatory proofs that are similar in perspective to Pincock\u2019s\napproach. In their cases the determination of the explanatory power of\ndifferent proofs requires a formalization of the proofs in logical\nsystems. While for Wilhelm the explanatory power of a proof comes from\nthe balance between the simplicity and the depth of the formalized\nproof, Poggiolesi distinguishes an explanatory proof from a\nnon-explanatory one in that only in the (formalized version of the)\nformer one can witness an increase of conceptual complexity from the\nassumptions to the theorem the proof aims to establish.\n\n2.2.2 Internalist models of mathematical explanation\n\nIn a paper of 1974, Friedman posed a challenge for any coherent\naccount of scientific, and thus presumably also mathematical,\nexplanation: he argued that any such account needed to show how\nexplanation generates understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t see how the\nphilosopher of science can afford to ignore such concepts as\n\u2018understanding\u2019 and \u2018intelligibility\u2019 when\ngiving a theory of the explanation relation\u201d (Friedman 1974, 8).\nWhile externalist, or ontic, accounts do not directly concern\nthemselves with Friedman\u2019s challenge, they do not deny the link\nbetween explanation and understanding. However, they simply do not\npose understanding as a defining characteristic of explanation. By\ncontrast, internalist, or epistemic, accounts are those which directly\naddress this challenge.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, one of the main conceptions of\nscientific understanding is the unificationist model which argues that\nexplanations provide understanding by unifying different phenomena.\nAlthough the idea is undoubtedly intuitively appealing, the key\nquestion is whether the notion of unification can be made more precise\nso that we can distinguish between what an explanation is and what is\nnot. Friedman (1974) is an early attempt to do this, although his\nformulation was quickly shown to suffer from several technical\nproblems (see Kitcher 1976). Kitcher is, on the other hand, the main\nsupporter of the unificationist approach. His proposal consists in\nlooking at unification as the reduction of the number of argument\npatterns used in providing explanations while being as comprehensive\nas possible in the number of phenomena explained:\n\nUnderstanding the phenomena is not simply a matter of reducing the\n\u201cfundamental incomprehensibilities\u201d but of seeing\nconnections, common patterns, in what initially appeared to be\ndifferent situations. Here the switch in conception from premise\nconclusion pairs to derivations proves vital. Science advances our\nunderstanding of nature by showing us how to derive descriptions of\nmany phenomena, using the same patterns of derivation again and again,\nand, in demonstrating this, it teaches us how to reduce the number of\ntypes of facts that we have to accept as ultimate (or brute). So the\ncriterion of unification I shall try to articulate will be based on\nthe idea that E(K) is a set of derivations that makes the best\ntradeoff between minimizing the number of patterns of derivation\nemployed and maximizing the number of conclusions generated. (Kitcher\n1989, 432)\n\n\nLet us make this a little bit more formal. Let us start with a set K\nof beliefs assumed to be consistent and deductively closed (informally\none can think of this as a set of statements endorsed by an ideal\nscientific community at a specific moment in time; Kitcher 1981, 75).\nA systematization of K is any set of arguments that derive some\nsentences in K from other sentences of K. The explanatory store over\nK, E(K), is the best systematization of K (Kitcher here makes an\nidealization by claiming that E(K) is unique). Corresponding to\ndifferent systematizations we have different degrees of unification.\nThe highest degree of unification is that given by E(K). But according\nto what criteria can a systematization be judged to be the best? There\nare three factors: the number of patterns, the stringency of the\npatterns, and the set of consequences derivable from the\nunification.\n\nTwo remarks are in order when it comes to Kitcher\u2019s proposal.\nFirst, his account of theoretical unification is mainly thought of for\nthe general question of scientific explanation, although he sees as\none of the virtues of his viewpoint to be extendable to mathematics as\nwell. Secondly, Kitcher\u2019s model is not meant to address the\nlocal question of what distinguishes an explanatory proof from one\nthat does not explain (as all other accounts do); it rather provides a\nnovel perspective on the global question of how to systemize a whole\nbody of knowledge that has explanatory value. The application of\nKitcher\u2019s model to explanatory proofs has been explored in two\nopposite directions. On the one hand, Hafner and Mancosu (2008) tested\nKitcher\u2019s model with three different methods to prove theorems\nabout real closed fields (see Brumfiel 1979); the authors showed that\nthe model makes predictions about the explanatory power of these\nmethods which contradicts judgments coming from the mathematical\npractice (See also Pincock 2015b). On the other hand, Frans (2021) not\nonly reassesses the value of unificatory understanding, which it is a\ntype of explanatory understanding, for mathematics; additionally, he\nshows through a plethora of different examples, ranging from\nPythagoras\u2019 theorem to the theorem that states that sum of the\nfirst n integers equals n(n+1)/2, that proofs can contribute to\nunificatory understanding. \n\nA novel internalist account has recently been proposed by Inglis and\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos (2019), who apply Wilkenfeld\u2019s functional\nmodel of understanding (see Wilkenfeld (2014)) to the mathematical\ncase. Wilkenfield\u2019s approach consists in reversing\nFriedman\u2019s perspective: while Friedman demanded that\nphilosophers clarify how explanations, suitably defined, generate\nunderstanding, Wilkenfield defines explanations as those things that\ngenerate understanding. By doing so, Wilkenfield moves the burden of\nclarification from the notion of explanation to that of understanding\nand how it is generated: this move \u2013 he argues\n\u2013 has recently become tenable as philosophical accounts of\nunderstanding have become more and more sophisticated. \n\nIn Inglis & Meji\u0301a-Ramos (2019) the conception of\nunderstanding adopted is that of Kelp (2016), along with a modal\nmodel of the generation of understanding (see Atkinson and\nShiffrin 1968). With these two elements at hand, Inglis &\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos identify three properties that any mathematical\nexplanatory proof is likely to have: (i) an explanatory proof would\ndirect the reader\u2019s attention to its conceptually important\nsection; (ii) it would reorganize the new and existing information\ninto coherent new schema; (iii) it would reduce the chances of working\nmemory capacity to be exceeded.\n\nOther internalist accounts of explanatory proof have been developed by\nDelarivi\u00e8re, Frans & Kerkhove (2017), Dutilh Novaes (2018),\nand Lehet (2021).\n3. Some connections to other debates\n\nA number of fruitful studies have recently appeared connecting\nmathematical explanation to mathematical beauty, purity of methods,\nunderstanding in mathematics, mathematical style, and mathematical\ndepth. We simply refer to one or two such background studies and\nencourage the reader to explore the bibliography of the studies\nreferred to. The most extensive studies connecting mathematical beauty\nand explanation are Giaquinto (2016) and Lange (2016). The notion of\npurity of method has long been of interest to mathematicians and\nphilosophers (see Detlefsen and Arana (2011) and Arana and Mancosu\n(2012)). Among the most recent contributions on purity and\nmathematical explanation are Skow (2015), Lange (2015b), Ryan (2021)\nand Arana (2023). The connection between mathematical explanation and\nunderstanding has been discussed in Molinini (2011), Cellucci (2014),\nand Delarivi\u00e9re et al. (2017). For connections between\nmathematical depth and mathematical explanation see Lange (2015c).\nMoreover, theorists of style in mathematics and science have\nemphasized the importance of explanatory arguments for characterizing\nstyle (see Mancosu (2021) for an overview).\n\nThe issues that have shaped the debates about mathematical explanation\nreviewed in sections 1 and 2 also arise in ongoing debates in the\nphilosophy of mind and moral theory. For the philosophy of mind, one\npuzzle is how appealing to mental properties can explain human actions\neven though a human is a physical entity. If non-mental, physical\nproperties are apt to explain any physical event or pattern of\nphysical events, then it seems that mental properties are dispensable\nor \u201cepiphenomenal\u201d. For moral theory, a series of\nquestions arise about how moral properties relate to the presumably\nnon-moral features of the physical world. In terms of explanation, it\nseems like there is no explanatory work for moral properties to do, at\nleast with respect to physical events. However, our ordinary practices\nfrequently appeal to these properties in putative explanations. So, as\nwith the philosophy of mind, it seems that we must either revise our\nexplanatory practices or else find a place for these properties in a\nmore comprehensive conception of reality.\n\nKim\u2019s exclusion argument is a prominent driver of these debates\nin the philosophy of mind (Kim 2005). Kim argues that the existence of\nmental properties requires that these properties provide some genuine\ncontribution to the explanation of physical events. However, Kim\nmaintains that mental properties are excluded from this contribution\nby the causal closure of the physical, i.e. every physical event has a\npurely physical explanation. One response to Kim is that the right\nconception of causal explanation makes space for mental properties to\nexplain (Shapiro & Sober 2007, Woodward 2021b). The\n\u201cexplanatory autonomy\u201d of the mental can thus be obtained\nin a way that parallels similar generalizations of causal explanation\nto allow for genuine mathematical explanations of physical phenomena\n(section 1.2). Pluralists about mathematical explanation can develop a\ndifferent response to exclusion arguments: if explanations come in\ndifferent kinds, then an explanation of one kind does not stand in the\nway of an explanation of another kind (Batterman 2021). Baker (2022)\nhas pursued a different kind of response that compares Dennett\u2019s\nintentional stance with a \u201cmathematical stance\u201d that\nenables mathematical explanations of physical phenomena.\n\nHarman and Street have advanced explanatory challenges to moral\nproperties that can be fruitfully compared to criticisms of the\nexplanatory indispensability argument for mathematical platonism\n(Harman 1977, Street 2006). While Harman focuses on the explanation of\nmoral observations (e.g. that some action is wrong), Street emphasizes\na broader concern with explaining other phenomena such as the\nprevalence of some moral judgments (e.g. that murder is wrong). For\nboth, the challenge is that the best explanation does not involve\nmoral properties. That is, moral properties are explanatorily\ndispensable for the targets in question. As Sinclair and Leibowitz\nemphasize, this argument, and the responses to it, parallel debates\nabout the explanatory dispensability of mathematical objects (Sinclair\n& Leibowitz 2016). One innovation in the debate about moral\nproperties is Enoch\u2019s argument that it is sufficient for moral\nproperties to be indispensable to practical deliberation. If this\nnon-Quinean condition for ontological commitment is granted, then it\nmay be feasible to identify new forms of explanatory indispensability\nfor mathematical objects. For some investigations into how such\narguments may or may not extend to mathematics, see Leng (2016), Baker\n(2016), Enoch (2016) and Clark-Doane (2020).\n",
