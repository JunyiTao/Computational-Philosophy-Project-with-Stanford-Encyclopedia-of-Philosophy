    "main_text": "Accounts of Our Persistence\n3. Accounts of Our Persistence\n\nThree main sorts of answers to the persistence question have been\nproposed. Psychological-continuity views say that our\npersistence consists in some psychological relation, the memory\ncriterion mentioned earlier being an example. You are that future\nbeing that in some sense inherits its mental features from\nyou\u2014beliefs, memories, preferences, the capacity for rational\nthought, and so on\u2014and you are that past being whose mental\nfeatures you have inherited in this way. There is dispute over what\nsort of inheritance this has to be\u2014whether it must be\nunderpinned by some kind of physical continuity, for instance, and\nwhether it requires a \u201cnon-branching\u201d\nrestriction\u2014and about what mental features need to be inherited.\n(We will return to some of these points.) But most philosophers\nwriting on personal identity since the early 20th century have\nendorsed some version of this view: e.g. Dainton 2008, Hudson (2001,\n2007), Johnston (1987, 2016), Lewis (1976), Nagel (1986: 40), Parfit\n(1971; 1984: 207; 2012), Shoemaker (1970; 1984: 90; 1997; 1999, 2008,\n2011), Unger (1990: ch. 5; 2000).\n\nA second answer is that our persistence consists in a physical\nrelation not involving psychology: you are that past or future being\nthat has your body, or that is the same biological organism as you\nare, or the like. Call these brute-physical views. (Advocates\ninclude Ayers (1990: 278\u2013292), Carter (1989), Olson (1997),\nSnowdon (2014), van Inwagen (1990: 142\u2013188), and Williams\n(1956\u20137, 1970).)\n\nSome try to combine these views, saying that we need both mental and\nphysical continuity to survive, or that either would suffice without\nthe other (Nozick 1981: ch. 1, Langford 2014, Madden 2016, Noonan\n2021).\n\nBoth views agree that there is something that it takes for us to\npersist\u2014that there are informative, nontrivial, necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a person existing at one time to exist at\nanother time. A third view, anticriterialism, denies this.\nPsychological and physical continuity are evidence for persistence, it\nsays, but do not always guarantee it and may not be required. The\nclearest advocate of this view is Merricks (1998; see also Swinburne\n1984, Lowe 1996: 41ff., 2012; Langford 2017; for criticism see\nZimmerman 1998, Shoemaker 2012). There is also debate about how\nanticriterialism should be understood (Olson 2012, Noonan 2011,\n2019a).\n",
