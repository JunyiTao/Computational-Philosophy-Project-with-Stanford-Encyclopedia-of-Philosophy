    "main_text": "Aristotle || Syntax and Semantics of Sentences\n2.3 Syntax and Semantics of Sentences\n\n\nWhen writing the De Interpretatione, Aristotle had worked out\nthe following theory of simple sentences: a (declarative) sentence\n(apophantikos logos) or declaration (apophansis) is\ndelimited from other pieces of discourse like prayer, command and\nquestion by its having a truth-value. The truth-bearers that feature\nin Aristotle\u2019s logic are thus linguistic items. They are spoken\nsentences that directly signify thoughts (shared by all humans) and\nthrough these, indirectly, things. Written sentences in turn signify\nspoken ones. (Simple) sentences are constructed from two signifying\nexpressions which stand in subject-predicate relation to each other: a\nname and a verb (\u2018Callias walks\u2019) or two names connected\nby the copula \u2018is\u2019, which co-signifies the connection\n(\u2018Pleasure is good\u2019) (Int. 3). Names are either\nsingular terms or common nouns (An. Pr. I 27). Both can be\nempty (Cat. 10, Int. 1). Singular terms can only\ntake subject position. Verbs co-signify time. A name-verb sentence can\nbe rephrased with the copula (\u2018Callias is (a) walking\n(thing)\u2019) (Int. 12). As to their quality, a\n(declarative) sentence is either an affirmation or a negation,\ndepending on whether it affirms or negates its predicate of its\nsubject. The negation particle in a negation has wide scope\n(Cat. 10). Aristotle defined truth separately for\naffirmations and negations: An affirmation is true if it says of that\nwhich is that it is; a negation is true if it says of that which is\nnot that it is not (Met. \u0393.7 1011b25ff). These\nformulations, or in any case their Greek counterparts, can be\ninterpreted as expressing either a correspondence or a deflationist\nconception of truth. Either way, truth is a property that belongs to a\nsentence at a given time. As to their quantity, sentences are\nsingular, universal, particular or indefinite. Thus Aristotle obtains\neight types of sentences, which are later dubbed \u2018categorical\nsentences\u2019. The following are examples, paired by quality:\n\n\nSingular:\nCallias is just.\nCallias is not just.\n\n\nUniversal:\nEvery human is just.\nNo human is just.\n\n\nParticular:\nSome human is just.\nSome human is not just.\n\n\nIndefinite:\n(A) human is just.\n(A) human is not just.\n\n\n\n\nUniversal and particular sentences contain a quantifier and both\nuniversal and particular affirmatives were taken to have existential\nimport. (See entry \n The Traditional Square of Opposition). \n The logical\nstatus of the indefinites is ambiguous and controversial\n(Int. 6\u20137).\n\n\nAristotle distinguishes between two types of sentential opposition:\ncontraries and contradictories. A contradictory pair of sentences (an\nantiphasis) consists of an affirmation and its negation (i.e.\nthe negation that negates of the subject what the affirmation affirms\nof it). Aristotle assumes that\u2014normally\u2014one of these must\nbe true, the other false. Contrary sentences are such that they cannot\nboth be true. The contradictory of a universal affirmative is the\ncorresponding particular negative; that of the universal negative the\ncorresponding particular affirmative. A universal affirmative and its\ncorresponding universal negative are contraries. Aristotle thus has\ncaptured the basic logical relations between monadic quantifiers\n(Int. 7).\n\n\nSince Aristotle regards tense as part of the truth-bearer (as opposed\nto merely a grammatical feature), he detects a problem regarding\nfuture tense sentences about contingent matters: Does the principle\nthat of an affirmation and its negation one must be false, the other\ntrue, apply to these? What, for example, is the truth-value now of the\nsentence \u2018There will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u2019? Aristotle\nmay have suggested that the sentence has no truth-value now, and that\nbivalence thus does not hold\u2014despite the fact that it is\nnecessary for there either to be or not to be a sea-battle tomorrow,\nso that the principle of excluded middle is preserved (Int.\n9).\n",
