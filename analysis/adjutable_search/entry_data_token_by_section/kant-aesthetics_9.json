As noted in\n Section 2.3.4\n above, some commentators take the demand for universal validity made\nby a judgment of beauty to amount to a moral demand, so that\nKant\u2019s argument for the universal validity of such judgments\ndepends on an appeal to morality. A more common view, however, is to\nsee judgments of beauty not as grounded in morality, but rather, along\nwith judgments of the sublime, as contributing to an account of moral\nfeeling, and hence of how morality is possible for human beings (for a\nclear statement of the contrast between these views, see the\nintroduction to Guyer 1993).\n\nThe idea that aesthetic judgment plays a role in grounding the\npossibility of morality for human beings is suggested at a very\ngeneral level in the Introduction to the Critique of\nJudgment, where Kant describes the faculty of judgment as\nbridging \u201cthe great gulf\u201d between the concept of nature\nand that of freedom (IX, 195). While Kant says that the concept or\nprinciple of judgment which mediates the transition between nature and\nfreedom is that of the \u201cpurposiveness of nature\u201d, which\ncould simply be understood as referring to nature\u2019s scientific\ncomprehensibility (see\n Section 3.2\n below), he also associates judgment in this context with the feeling\nof pleasure and displeasure, making clear that it is not only judgment\nin the context of empirical scientific enquiry, but also aesthetic\njudgment, which plays this bridging role.\n\nThe \u201cCritique of Aesthetic Judgment\u201d mentions a number of\nmore specific connections between aesthetics and morality, including\nthe following:\n\nAesthetic experience serves as a propadeutic for morality, in that\n\u201cthe beautiful prepares us to love something, even nature,\nwithout interest; the sublime, to esteem it, even contrary to our\n(sensible) interest\u201d (General Remark following \u00a729,\n267).\nThe demand for universal agreement in judgments of the sublime\nrests on an appeal to moral feeling (\u00a729, 265\u2013266)\nTaking a direct interest in the beauty of nature indicates\n\u201ca good soul\u201d and a \u201cmental attunement favorable to\nmoral feeling\u201d (\u00a742, 298\u2013299).\nBeauty serves as the \u201csymbol\u201d of morality (\u00a759,\npassim), in that a judgment of beauty \u201clegislates for\nitself\u201d rather than being \u201csubjected to a heteronomy of\nlaws of experience\u201d (\u00a759, 353); relatedly, feelings of\npleasure in the beautiful are analogous to moral consciousness\n(\u00a759, 354; see also General Comment following \u00a791,\n482n.).\nBeauty gives sensible form to moral ideas (\u00a760, 356); this is\nrelated both to the view that there is an analogy between the\nexperience of beauty and moral feeling (see (ii) above), and to the\nview that beauty is the expression of aesthetic ideas (see\n Section 2.6).\n Because of this, the development of moral ideas is the \u201ctrue\npropadeutic\u201d for taste (\u00a760, 356).\n\n\nThere is an influential discussion of beauty as the symbol of morality\nin T. Cohen (1982). Much of Guyer\u2019s work on the third\nCritique subsequent to his 1979 has emphasized the connection\nbetween aesthetics and morality, and in particular the role of\naesthetics in supporting the human moral vocation. As noted in\n Section 1,\n a number of commentators have seen unity of the Critique of\nJudgment in terms of moral teleology, and their work offers\nfurther discussion of the relation between aesthetics and morality;\nsee\n Section 1\n for references.\n",
