    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Self-Interpretation Accounts\n3.3 Self-Interpretation Accounts\n\nSome philosophers maintain that grasping our beliefs and\ndesires\u2014and perhaps also our emotions\u2014requires engaging in\na process of self-interpretation (Lawlor 2009; Carruthers 2011; Cassam\n2015). Self-interpretation accounts are one response to a point\nmentioned earlier (sec.\n 2.1):\n that our attitudes are partly defined by their causal roles,\nincluding how they dispose us to reason, behave, and affectively react\n(see the entries on\n belief\n and\n desire).\n Whether a given state plays the relevant causal role seems not to be\nknowable simply by introspective observation. (This point echoes the\nfirst horn of Boghossian\u2019s trilemma. See also Peterson 2019.) We\ncan know this only by interpreting our current thoughts or feelings,\nexplaining them as manifestations of a particular belief, desire, or\nother attitude. Since this interpretive process relies on inference,\nself-interpretation accounts are sometimes labelled \u201cinferentialism\u201d.\nBut inferentialism is a broader category, encompassing some\ntransparency accounts (sec. 3.4).\n\nLawlor uses the following example. A woman named Katherine finds\nherself thinking \u201chave another\u201d as she stands by her son\u2019s crib.\nHearing those words (in \u201cinner speech\u201d) does not, on its own, provide\nher with knowledge about whether she wants to have another child. She\nmust interpret this thought: is it a genuine longing or just an idle\ndaydream? The best interpretation is the one that best explains the\nintrospected thought. Arriving at this explanation will often involve\nimaginative exercises: e.g., Katherine may imagine a newborn baby in\nher arms and, noticing that this leads her to feel happy, infer that\nshe desires another child. Lawlor\u2019s approach is supported by\nresearch suggesting that \u201cpeople can detect their nonconscious\ndispositions and motives by vividly imagining a future situation and\nattending to how it would make them feel.\u201d (Wilson and Dunn 2004,\ndescribing a study by Schultheiss and Brunstein (1999).)\n\nCarruthers\u2019 (2011) Interpretive-Sensory Access account similarly\ntakes self-knowledge to require self-interpretation. Rejecting the\nidea that there is an \u201cinner sense\u201d, a cognitive faculty dedicated\nspecifically to self-knowledge, Carruthers proposes that a single\n\u201cmindreading\u201d system detects both one\u2019s own mental\nstates and the mental states of others. In fact, he hypothesizes that\nour \u201cmindreading\u201d system \u201cevolved for outward-looking\nsocial purposes\u201d and was only later co-opted for self-knowledge\n(2011:69). This system takes sensory data as input; interprets these\ndata by drawing on situational facts and background information; and\nyields representations of mental states as output.\n\nLike the inner sense view, Carruthers\u2019 account takes the output\nof these states to qualify as knowledge on epistemically externalist\ngrounds--roughly, because of the system\u2019s reliability. By\ncontrast, Lawlor\u2019s account is friendly to epistemic internalism.\nSelf-interpretation is based on internal, accessible evidence\nincluding thoughts and feelings, as well as evidence from one\u2019s\nown behavior.\n\nThe idea that we must engage in interpretation to know our own\nattitudes and emotions echoes Ryle\u2019s (1949) view that our means\nof achieving self-knowledge is broadly similar to our means of knowing\nothers\u2019 states. In particular, self-interpretation theorists\nmaintain that, just as we know others\u2019 attitudes by inference\nfrom what they say, self-knowledge often involves inference from inner\nspeech. (I\u2019m indebted here to Byrne 2012a.) Ryle suggests that\nthe experience of inner speech is a maximally effective type of\n\u201ceavesdropping\u201d.\n\n\nWe eavesdrop on our own voiced utterances and our own silent\nmonologues. \u2026 [T]here is nothing intrinsically proprietary about\nthis activity. I can pay heed to what I overhear you saying as well as\nto what I overhear myself saying, though I cannot overhear your silent\ncolloquies with yourself. (Ryle 1949: 184)\n\n\nSelf-interpretation accounts do recognize differences between\nself-knowledge and other-knowledge. Most crucially, in our own case we\nhave access to introspective evidence (about our experiences), whereas\nour only evidence for others\u2019 states is their behavior,\nprominently including their verbal behavior. \n\nIs our access to introspective evidence also inferential, in a way\nthat threatens a regress? Self-interpretation theorists maintain that\neven understanding what you\u2019re currently feeling will require\nself-interpretation. Cassam explains this using Lawlor\u2019s\nexample: \u201cWhen you identify your feeling as the yearning for another\nchild what you are doing is interpreting it\u201d (Cassam 2015:\n163). Cassam argues that this process is holistic, as you rely on\nknowledge of your recent mental life (e.g., recently feeling envy\nabout others\u2019 pregnancies) and perhaps your recent behavior\n(going out of your way to visit a friend with a newborn) to interpret\nyour current feelings.\n\nThe self-interpretation view is compatible with the idea that we know\nsome of our states non-inferentially. Carruthers argues that\ninterpretation is not required for knowledge of any state that can be\nrecognized solely on the basis of raw sensory data, since sensory data\nare the inputs to the mindreading system. Cassam is more circumspect\nabout this possibility, pointing out that even knowledge of basic\nsensations like pains sometimes requires cognitive effort (2015:\n164).\n\nCritics of self-interpretation accounts contend that it neglects the\nprofound asymmetry between self-knowledge and other-knowledge: that\nour rationality guarantees that we have non-inferential access to our\nown attitudes (Shoemaker 1994) or that the need to engage in\nself-interpretation implies that we are alienated from our attitudes\n(Moran 2001). These claims form the basis for some rationalist and\nagentialist views (see 3.6 and 3.7).\n",
