    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Ethics\n\n\nAntiochus maintained that his ethical theory was that of the\nPeripatetics and original Old Academics just as he had maintained that\nhis Stoicizing epistemology was in substance that of the Old Academy\n(Cicero, Fin. 5.7, 14; Acad. 1.22). He could make\nthis claim about his ethical theory with more justice. On the crucial\nquestion of whether to recognize external and bodily items as goods in\naddition to virtue, he agreed with Aristotle and the Peripatos and\ndisagreed with the Stoics, who made virtue the sole good. Nonetheless,\nhis theory is greatly indebted to the Stoa, and it draws on anti-Stoic\narguments of his predecessors in the Academy that also tend to\npresuppose Stoic ideas.  Roughly speaking, Antiochus defended the\nPeripatetic view about goods on the basis of considerations and in the\ncontext of assumptions that belong to a Stoic and not an Aristotelian\nframework (cf. White 1978).\n\n\nCicero expounds and criticizes Antiochus\u2019 theory in book 5 of the\nDe finibus and draws on Antiochus in his critique of Stoic\nethics in book 4 (trans. in Annas and Woolf 2001). The Stoics\nmaintained that only virtue, which is identical with wisdom or the\nperfection of reason, is good and only vice, its opposite, evil,\nwhereas all the so-called goods, like health and strength, and their\nopposites, the so-called evils, were indifferent (see the section\nEthics in the entry on Stoicism).\nNonetheless the Stoics took some indifferents, often those generally\nregarded as goods by others, to be preferred and some, often those\ngenerally regarded as evils, to be dispreferred. This distinction\nfurnished the material or subject matter for rational\nselection. Virtue consists in fully rational selection among them. The\nwise or virtuous person acts with a view to obtaining preferred items\nand avoiding their opposites, but it is as an expression of his\nperfected reason that acts of selection are good, not because they\nsecure, or tend to secure, preferred items for him or protect, or tend\nto protect, him from their dispreferred opposites. According to the\nStoics, the sole necessary and sufficient condition for human good and\ntherefore happiness is the possession of virtue. Indifferent items\ncannot add to or detract from the goodness of such a life by their\npresence or absence.\n\n\nTo judge by Cicero\u2019s evidence from book 4 of the of the De\nfinibus, Antiochus appears to have argued against this position\nby confronting the Stoics with a dilemma.  Either the so-called\npreferred indifferents really were absolutely and utterly\nindifferent. In that case, the Stoic position collapsed into that of\nphilosophers like the heterodox Stoic, Ariston of Chios, who refused\nto make distinctions of any kind among the indifferents, thus\nrendering virtue incapable of supplying practical guidance by\ndestroying the basis for rational selection among actions (Cicero,\nFin.  4.47, 60, 69). Or speaking of preferred indifferents\nwas a merely verbal innovation, and the Stoics really regarded the\nitems they called preferred as goods, albeit lesser goods, capable of\nmaking a life better by their presence and worse by their\nabsence. Antiochus favored the latter diagnosis (Cicero,\nFin. 5.74), and his own position was that virtue is the chief\ngood, but not the sole good; this is the Peripatetic view, which he\nmay well have been right to attribute to the original Old Academy as\nwell (Cicero, Fin. 4.60, 61; 5.14; Acad. 1.22).\n\n\nThe way in which Antiochus appeals to human nature and its development\nin the exposition and defense of his ethics is modeled closely on\nStoic theory, however. To be sure, Aristotle assigns an important role\nto the development of character through habituation. But Antiochus\nfollows the Stoics and Epicureans in using what modern scholarship has\nbeen called the \u201ccradle argument\u201d (Fin.  5.55). The idea is\nthat by attending to the behavior of infants, who have not yet been\ncorrupted by contact with society, we will be able to isolate our\noriginal natural impulses and discover what the first objects of\nnatural concern or attachment are. If one accepts a general principle\naccording to which the object or objects with which we are naturally\nconcerned or to which we are attached by nature provide the basis for\ndetermining the human good, the cradle argument can be used to answer\nthe question what is the true goal of human life.\n The Epicureans maintained that infants are naturally impelled to\npleasure, and that the goal for adult humans is a life of\npleasure. The Stoics argued that our first natural impulses were not\ntoward pleasure (and away from pain) but towards the \u201cnatural\nadvantages,\u201d things like health and strength, bodily integrity and\nwell-functioning senses (and away from their opposites). But it was\nnot because they thought these items were goods; they insisted that\nthey are indifferent, though preferred. The infant\u2019s natural concern\nfor them is the first stage of a development in which what is truly\ngood only appears later. According to the Stoics, if all goes well, a\nhuman being\u2019s motives undergo a radical transformation from the\ninfant\u2019s.  Only at a later point does the human being recognize virtue\nand virtuous activity as the only human goods and act for the sake of\nthe true good.  Preferred indifferents are the material or subject\nmatter for the rational selection in which virtue consists, but\nnothing more.  Since the objects of our first natural impulses turn\nout not to be good but indifferent, to be the object of a natural\nimpulse, or to be in accord with our nature in the way such objects\nare, is not thereby to be good.\n\n\nAntiochus agrees with the Stoics about the importance of the first\nnatural impulses and, by and large, about which items are the objects\nof those impulses. But unlike them, he accepts the principle that what\nagrees or accords with a creature\u2019s fully developed adult nature, as\nit is expressed in its natural impulses, is good for that creature,\nand that the good life for human beings is therefore the life\ncharacterized by the fullest possible enjoyment of the goods\ncorresponding to our natural impulses (Cicero, Acad. 1.19,\n22; Fin. 5.24\u20135). He believes that he has an Old\nAcademic authority for this in Polemon (Cicero, Fin.  4.14;\nAcad. 2.131), head of the Academy at the end of the fourth\ncentury B.C.E. Nonetheless, despite admitting other goods, he holds\nthat virtue is the highest human good, and he believes that his theory\ncan explain why it is the chief human good without having to make it\nthe only good as the Stoics had done.\n\n\nOn his view, the development which leads a human being to virtue does\nnot involve a radical transformation of the kind posited by the\nStoics. Rather, if all goes well, a human being comes to value reason,\nand hence virtue as the perfection of reason, above all other things\nbecause reason is the most important part of human nature. It is not\nso much the character of a human being\u2019s motivation that is\ntransformed as he develops, according to Antiochus, but rather the\nself which is the object of his natural concern. As a result, though\nvirtue is the chief human good, there is room for other goods as well,\nbecause they are in accord with human nature too, albeit less\nimportant parts of it. Antiochus\u2019 use of the Stoic framework puts him\nin a position to fault the Stoics for abandoning or forgetting the\nnature from which they set out (Cicero, Fin. 4.26, 43; 5.72)\nand for failing to see the difference between taking reason to be the\nmost important part of human nature\u2014which is correct\u2014and\nthinking that it is the only part (4.41).\n\n\nLike the Stoics, however, Antiochus wants to claim that virtue is\nsufficient for happiness. Stoic ethics ensures this result by denying\nthat there are any goods or evils apart from virtue and vice and\ntherefore any items capable of affecting the goodness of a life except\nvirtue and vice. This option was not open to Antiochus because he\nthinks that there are other goods and evils, which do have this\npower. His solution, which is the most distinctive feature of his\nethical system and the one that seems to have drawn the most\ncriticism, is to distinguish between the happy life (vita\nbeata in Cicero\u2019s Latin), for which virtue is sufficient, and the\ncompletely or entirely happy life (vita beatissima)\n(Fin. 5.71, 95; T.D. 5.22), which requires bodily\nand external goods as well (see Irwin 1992).\n",
