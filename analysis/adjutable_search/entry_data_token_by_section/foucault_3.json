    "main_text": "Major Works || Histories of Madness and Medicine\n3.1 Histories of Madness and Medicine\n\nFoucault\u2019s History of Madness in the Classical Age\n(1961) originated in his academic study of psychology (a licence\nde psychologie in 1949 and a diplome de\npsycho-pathologie in 1952), his work in a Parisian mental\nhospital, and his own personal psychological problems. It was mainly\nwritten during his post-graduate Wanderjahren (1955\u201359)\nthrough a succession of diplomatic/educational posts in Sweden,\nGermany, and Poland. A study of the emergence of the modern concept of\n\u201cmental illness\u201d in Europe, History of Madness is\nformed from both Foucault\u2019s extensive archival work and his\ncritique of what he saw as the moral hypocrisy of modern psychiatry.\nStandard histories saw the nineteenth-century medical treatment of\nmadness (developed from the reforms of Pinel in France and the Tuke\nbrothers in England) as an enlightened liberation of the mad from the\nignorance and brutality of preceding ages. But, according to Foucault,\nthe new idea that the mad were merely sick (\u201cmentally\u201d\nill) and in need of medical treatment was not at all a clear\nimprovement on earlier conceptions (e.g., the Renaissance idea that\nthe mad were in contact with the mysterious forces of cosmic tragedy\nor the seventeenth-eighteenth-century view of madness as a renouncing\nof reason). Moreover, he argued that the alleged scientific neutrality\nof modern medical treatments of insanity are in fact covers for\ncontrolling challenges to conventional bourgeois morality. In short,\nFoucault argued that what was presented as an objective,\nincontrovertible scientific discovery (that madness is mental illness)\nwas in fact the product of eminently questionable social and ethical\ncommitments.\n\nFoucault\u2019s next history, The Birth of the Clinic (1963)\nalso presents a critique of modern clinical medicine. But the\nsocio-ethical critique is muted (except for a few vehement passages),\npresumably because there is a substantial core of objective truth in\nmedicine (as opposed to psychiatry) and so less basis for criticism.\nAs a result The Birth of the Clinic is much closer to a\nstandard history of science, in the tradition of Canguilhem\u2019s\nhistory of concepts.\n",
