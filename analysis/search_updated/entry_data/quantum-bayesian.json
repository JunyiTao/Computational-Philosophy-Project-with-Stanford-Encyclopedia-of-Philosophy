    "preamble": "\n\nQuantum theory is fundamental to contemporary\n physics.[1]\n It is natural to view a fundamental physical theory as describing or\nrepresenting the physical world. But many physicists and some\nphilosophers have questioned or rejected this view of quantum theory.\nThey have viewed the theory as concerned with our observation and\ndescription of, knowledge or beliefs about, or interactions with the\nworld. Views of this kind have been expressed since the 1920s when\nquantum theory emerged in close to its present form. This entry is\nconcerned with more recent developments of this tradition by\nphysicists and philosophers, much of it described as quantum-Bayesian\nor pragmatist. This entry discusses the form of quantum-Bayesianism\nknown as QBism in section 1, addressing common objections in section\n2. After section 3 briefly notes pragmatist influences on QBism\nsection 4 sketches a variety of self-described pragmatist approaches\nto quantum theory, while section 5 mentions some related views.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. QBism\n\nBecause the term \u2018Bayesianism\u2019 may be understood in many\ndifferent ways, a variety of views of quantum theory could be\nconsidered Quantum-Bayesian. QBism is a form of Quantum Bayesianism\nthat may be traced back to a point of view on states and probabilities\nin quantum theory adopted by C.M. Caves, C.A. Fuchs, and R. Schack\n(2002). In its more recent incarnation (Fuchs, Mermin, & Schack\n2014) its proponents have adopted the name QBism for reasons discussed\nin\n \u00a71.1.\n In deference to its contemporary proponents, this shorter name is\nused. Fuchs, Mermin, and Schack 2014, and DeBrota and Stacey (2019,\n  Other Internet Resources)\n provide elementary introductions to QBism; Fuchs and Schack 2015, and\nFuchs and Stacey 2019 give more detailed summaries of the view; von\nBaeyer 2016 is a popular book-length introduction\n\nQBists maintain that rather than (either directly or indirectly)\nrepresenting a physical system, a quantum state represents the\nepistemic state of the one who assigns it concerning that\nagent\u2019s possible future experiences. It does this by specifying\nthe agent\u2019s coherent degree of belief (credence) in each of a\nvariety of alternative experiences that may result from a specific act\nthe agent may perform. To get an idea of the kinds of experience and\nact the QBist has in mind it is helpful to think of the possible\noutcomes of a quantum measurement on a physical system. But QBists\nhave proposed the extension of the view to encompass every\nexperience that may result from any action (Fuchs, Mermin,\nand Schack 2014; Mermin 2017).\n\nAs quantum theory is usually presented, the Born Rule provides an\nalgorithm for generating probabilities for alternative outcomes of a\nmeasurement of one or more observables on a quantum system. These\nprobabilities have traditionally been regarded as objective, in line\nwith the idea that the theory is irreducibly indeterministic.\n\nBy contrast, QBists hold a subjective Bayesian or personalist view of\nquantum probabilities (see entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n Taking a quantum state merely to provide input to the Born Rule\nspecifying these probabilities, they regard quantum state assignments\nas equally subjective. The quantum state assigned by an agent then\nprovides a convenient representation of an important part of his or\nher own overall state of belief. So quantum theory as a whole is\n\u201ca users\u2019 manual that any agent can pick up and use to\nhelp make wiser decisions in this world of inherent uncertainty\u201d\n(Fuchs 2010, 8,\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nQBists argue that from this point of view quantum theory faces no\nconceptual problems associated with measurement or non-locality. While\nQBism has implications for the nature of physical science, from this\npoint of view quantum theory has few if any direct\nimplications for the nature of physical reality.\n1.1 History\n\nContemporary QBists (Mermin 2014: 422; Fuchs 2011) have sought\nprecedents among such authorities as Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Niels\nBohr, Wolfgang Pauli, J.A. Wheeler, and William James. But what came\nto be known as quantum-Bayesianism and later QBism began as a\ncollaboration between Caves, Fuchs, and Schack at the turn of the\n21st century (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2002a,b), although\nCaves no longer considers himself a QBist. N. David Mermin (2014,\n2019) became a convert more recently and has proposed extending the\nQBist vision of science to resolve at least one long-standing\nconceptual issue raised by classical physics. Stacey (2019,\n Other Internet Resources)\n tracks changes from the Quantum-Bayesianism of 2002 to the QBism of\n2019.\n\nIn conformity with standard terminology, on which the word\n\u201cBayesian\u201d does not carry a commitment to denying\nobjective probability, proponents of QBism no longer take the\n\u201cB\u201d to refer simply to Bayesianism. Insisting that\nprobability has no physical existence even in a quantum world, they\nfollow Bruno de Finetti in identifying probability with coherent\ndegree of belief or credence. But according to Fuchs (2016,\n Other Internet Resources)\n \u201cB\u201d should not be taken to abbreviate\n\u201cBrunism\u201d since de Finetti would not have accepted all of\nQBism\u2019s metaphysics: so \u201cQBism\u201d is now best\nunderstood simply as a stand-alone proper name for the view of quantum\ntheory described in what follows.\n1.2 Probability\n\nApplied to radioactive decay, the Born Rule of quantum theory is taken\nsuccessfully to predict such things as the half-life of the first\nexcited state of the hydrogen atom\u2014that the probability that an\natom of hydrogen in this state will be found to have decayed to the\nground state after \\(1.1 \\times 10^{-9}\\) seconds (i.e., just over a\nbillionth of a second) is \u00bd. This prediction has been\nexperimentally confirmed by measuring how the frequency with which\nphotons are emitted by a large number of hydrogen atoms in the decay\nof this excited state decreases over time. Most physicists regard this\nand other probabilities predicted by quantum theory as objective\nphysical features of the world, typically identifying the probability\nof decay with the relative frequency of decay as measured in such an\nexperiment.\n\nBut there are strong reasons not to equate probability with any actual\nrelative frequency (see entry\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.4). Many philosophers, including Karl Popper (1967) and David\nLewis (1986), have taken Born probabilities instead to exemplify a\ndistinctive kind of objective property (propensity or chance,\nrespectively) that may be ascribed to actual or possible individual\nevents. Lewis took quantum indeterminism to be the last hold-out of\nobjective chance.\n\nBy contrast, QBists adopt a subjectivist or personalist interpretation\nof probability, in quantum theory as elsewhere (see entry on\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.3). This makes the Born Rule of quantum theory not a law of\nnature but an empirically motivated norm of rationality a wise agent\nshould follow in addition to those whose violation would render the\nagent\u2019s degrees of belief incoherent. As usually formulated, the\nBorn Rule specifies probabilities for various possible measurement\noutcomes given a quantum state: But QBists also adopt a subjectivist\nor personalist interpretation of quantum states.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation specifying the time development of a\nsystem\u2019s quantum state \\(\\psi\\) \n\\[\\tag{1}\\label{ex1} H\\psi = i\\hslash \\,{\\partial \\psi /\\partial t} \\]\n\n\nis often thought of as the basic dynamical law of quantum mechanics,\nwhere \\(H\\) (called the Hamiltonian operator) is said to represent the\nsystem\u2019s energy. Instead QBists take this equation as providing\na synchronic constraint on an agent\u2019s credences concerning the\nagent\u2018s experiences at different times, and not a diachronic\nconstraint on the system\u2019s properties at those times. QBists\nalso consider the Hamiltonian (along with all other observables)\nwithin the purview of each individual agent rather than objectively\ndetermined by the system\u2019s properties. It follows that equally\nrational agents who assign the same quantum state to a system at a\ntime \\(t_1\\) may consistently assign it different states at a time\n\\(t_2\\) because they apply the constraint supplied by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation in different ways.\n\nIn its usual formulation the Born Rule does not look like a normative\nconstraint on credences. QBists prefer to reformulate it purely as a\nrelation among (subjective) probabilities without reference to a\nquantum state. In the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) it relates\nprobabilities \\(q\\) of actual measurement outcomes \\(j\\) to\nprobabilities of outcomes of a hypothetical fiducial\nmeasurement of a special kind called a\n SIC.[2]\n \n\\[\\tag{2}\\label{ex2} q(j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} [(d+1) p(i) -1/d].r(j\\mathbin{|}i) \\]\n\n\nThis equation is not just a revision of the law of total probability\nit resembles, i.e., \n\\[\\tag{3}\\label{ex3} q(j) =\\sum_{i=1}^{d^2} p (i).r(j \\mathbin{|} i) \\]\n\n\nbecause \\(p(i)\\), \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) refer to a\nhypothetical measurement, not the actual measurement.\n\nIn more detail, suppose an agent has degrees of belief \\(p(i)\\) that\nthe outcome of a SIC on a system would be the \\(i\\)th, and\ndegree of belief \\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\) in the \\(j\\)th\noutcome of an actual measurement \\(M\\) conditional on the\n\\(i\\)th outcome for the hypothetical SIC on that system.\nThen QBists take Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), stating a condition on the\nagent\u2019s degree of belief \\(q(j)\\) that the outcome of \\(M\\) will\nbe the \\(j\\)th, as their preferred formulation of the Born\nRule. In this expression \\(d\\) stands for the dimension of the\nsystem\u2019s Hilbert space (assumed to be a positive integer).\n\nTheir idea is that when the fiducial measurement is a SIC,\n\\(r(j\\mathbin{|}i)\\)) encodes the agent\u2019s belief about the type\nof measurement \\(M\\), while \\(p(i)\\) encodes his or her quantum state\nfor the system on which this measurement is performed. They maintain\nthat the Born Rule in this form is an empirically motivated addition\nto probability theory\u2014a normative requirement of quantum\nBayesian coherence (Fuchs and Schack 2013; DeBrota, Fuchs, Pienaar,\nand Stacey, 2021) that supplements the usual coherence conditions on\ndegrees of belief required to avoid a Dutch book (a set of bets an\nagent is guaranteed to lose, come what may).\n\nIt is common (at least in physical applications) to identify\nprobability 1 with objective certainty, at least for finite\nprobability spaces. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (1935, EPR) made\nthis identification in the following sufficient condition for reality\nwith which they premised their famous argument for the incompleteness\nof quantum mechanical description of physical reality:\n\n\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality\ncorresponding to this physical quantity. (EPR: 777)\n\n\nQBists (Caves, Fuchs, and Schack 2007) reject this identification and\nrefute EPR\u2019s argument that quantum description is incomplete by\ndenying this premise. Eschewing all objective physical probabilities,\nthey rather identify probability 1 with an agent\u2019s subjective\ncertainty\u2014full belief in a statement or event that an equally\nwell informed rational agent may believe to a lesser degree, or not at\nall.\n1.3 Measurement\n\nThose who believe that a quantum state completely describes the system\nto which it is assigned and that this state always evolves linearly\n(e.g., according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation) face the notorious\nquantum measurement problem: Application of quantum theory to the\ninteraction between a quantum system and a quantum measuring device\nwould almost always leave these in a state that describes the\nmeasurement as having no outcome, contrary to the direct experience of\ncountless experimentalists (see entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory,\n \u00a74).\n\nSome have followed Dirac (1930) and von Neumann (1932) in assuming\nthat a measurement is a physical process in which a quantum state\nalmost never evolves linearly but rather changes discontinuously and\nstochastically into one of a variety of possible states, each of which\nmay describe its outcome. But attempts to state precisely when such a\nprocess occurs and to verify its occurrence experimentally have been\nunsuccessful, and many understand quantum theory as excluding its\noccurrence.\n\nQBists avoid this problem by denying that a quantum state (even\nincompletely) describes the system to which it assigned. Any user of\nquantum theory assigns his or her personal quantum state on the basis\nof available information, subject only to the normative constraints of\nquantum-Bayesian coherence. This state assignment need conform neither\nto \u201cthe way that system really is\u201d, nor to the state\nassignments of other users. Quantum mechanics is a single user theory,\nand any coincidence among states assigned by different users is just\nthat\u2014coincidence. An agent may reassign a state on the basis of\nnewly acquired information, perhaps described as observation of the\noutcome of a measurement. When this happens, the new state is often\nnot continuous with the old state. This represents no physical\ndiscontinuity associated with measurement, but merely reflects the\nagent\u2019s updated epistemic state in the light of experience.\n\nNevertheless, in certain circumstances different users may be expected\nto come to assign similar or even identical quantum states by updating\ntheir prior credences to take account of common (though never\nidentical) experiences, some of which each may describe as experiences\nof the outcomes of quantum measurements on systems. Because QBists\ntake the quantum state to have the role of representing an\nagent\u2019s epistemic state they may avail themselves of personalist\nBayesian arguments purporting to show the convergence of priors on\nupdating in the light of common information. Also, just as de Finetti\nshowed that a subjectivist agent\u2019s credences may evolve as if\nrefining estimates of an unknown objective probability, QBists (Caves,\nFuchs, and Schack 2002b) have shown that the credences of a user of\nquantum theory may evolve as if refining his or her assignment of an\nunknown objective quantum state.\n\nJ.S. Bell (2004) argued forcefully that the word\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d has no place in a formulation of quantum\nmechanics with any pretension to physical precision. QBists frequently\nuse this word in formulating their view, but unlike Bohr and his\nCopenhagen followers they do not think of a measurement as a purely\nphysical process, but as describing an agent\u2019s action on the\nworld that results in a specific experience of it. They view quantum\ntheory not as offering descriptions of the world involving the\nimprecise physical term \u201cmeasurement\u201d, but as an\nintellectual tool for helping its users interact with the world to\npredict, control, and understand their experiences of it. Fuchs (2010,\n Other Internet Resources)\n and Mermin (2017) are quite explicit and unapologetic that a\nthoroughgoing QBist presentation of quantum theory would speak of\nagents, their actions and their experiences\u2014all primitive terms\nthey take neither to require nor to admit of precise physical\nspecification.\n1.4 Nonlocality\n\nBell\u2019s arguments (2004) have convinced some physicists and many\nphilosophers that certain patterns of correlation among spatially\nseparated events correctly predicted by quantum theory manifest\nnon-local influences between some of these events (see entry on\n action at a distance in quantum mechanics).\n QBists use their view of measurement-as-experience to reject any such\nnon-local influences.\n\nFor a QBist, what science rests on are not objective reports of\nlocalized physical events but the individual agent\u2019s\nexperiences. Being present at a single location, at no time does an\nindividual agent experience spatially separated\n events.[3]\n Correlations taken to manifest non-local influences supposedly\nconcern events in different places\u2014say where Alice is and where\nBob is. But Alice can only experience events where she is, not at\nBob\u2019s distant location. When she hears Bob\u2019s report of\nwhat he experienced at a distant location, this is an experience she\nhas where she is, not where Bob reports having had his\nexperience. So quantum theory is answerable to patterns of correlation\nnot among spatially separated physical events, but among Alice\u2019s\n(as also among Bob\u2019s) spatially coincident experiences. QBists\nargue that Alice, Bob, and any other agent can use quantum theory\nsuccessfully to account for her or his experiences with no appeal to\nany physical states (hidden or otherwise) or non-local physical\ninfluences.\n1.5 Decoherence\n\nClassical mechanics is generally taken to be reducible to quantum\nmechanics, at least approximately in some appropriate limit. For\nexample, Newton\u2019s second law of motion is sometimes said to be\nderivable from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the limit of large\nmass. But to retrieve classical dynamics it is generally thought\nnecessary to supplement any such derivation with an account of why\nordinary macroscopic objects do not exhibit the interference behavior\ncharacteristic of quantum superpositions.\n\nQuantum models of environmental decoherence are commonly thought to\nprovide such an account (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics).\n These typically involve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, this time\napplied to a system in interaction with its quantum environment. The\napplication can show how interactions entangle the quantum states of\nsystem and environment in a way that selects a \u201cpointer\nbasis\u201d in which the system\u2019s reduced (mixed) state remains\nvery nearly diagonal indefinitely. Somehow a particular element of\nthis basis is supposed to be identifiable as the system\u2019s\nphysical state, evolving in a way that approximates classical\ndynamics.\n\nIf the Schr\u00f6dinger equation were a dynamical law governing the\nevolution of a physical quantum state this would provide a physical\nfoundation on which to base a reduction of classical dynamics to\nquantum dynamics that appealed to quantum decoherence. But QBists\ndeny that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a dynamical law\ngoverning the evolution of an objective quantum state. For them it\nmerely provides a constraint on an agent\u2019s current epistemic\nstate. Fuchs (2010,\n Other Internet Resources)\n concluded that decoherence has no role to play in the misguided\nprogram attempting to reduce classical to quantum dynamics.\n\nInstead, QBists Fuchs and Schack (2012) have viewed decoherence as a\ncondition on an agent\u2019s present assignment of a quantum state to\na system following one contemplated measurement, when making decisions\nregarding the possible outcomes of a second measurement. As such, it\nfunctions as a normative synchronic coherence condition that may be\nseen as a consequence of van Fraassen\u2019s (1984) Reflection\nPrinciple. Instead of taking decoherence to select possible outcomes\nof a physical measurement process, QBists take these to be just\nwhatever experiences may follow the agent\u2019s action on the\nworld.\n1.6 Generalizations of QBism\n\nMermin (2014, 2019) has proposed extending QBism\u2019s view of the\nrole experience in science to what he calls CBism (Classical Bohrism).\nAccording to Carnap, Einstein was seriously worried about the problem\nof the Now:\n\n\nthat the experience of the Now means something special for man,\nsomething essentially different from the past and the future, but that\nthis important difference does not and cannot occur within physics.\n(Carnap 1963: 37\u201338)\n\n\nAccording to Mermin, Einstein had nothing to worry about because there\n\\(is\\) a place in physics for the present moment. He takes the present\nmoment as something that is immediately experienced by each of us, and\nso (from a CBist perspective) just the sort of thing that physics is\nultimately about. By contrast, he says\n\n\nspace-time is an abstraction that I construct to organize such\nexperiences. (Mermin 2014: 422\u20133)\n\n\nAccording to Mermin, a common Now is an inference for each person from\nhis or her immediate experience: But that it is as fundamental a\nfeature of two perceiving subjects that when two people are together\nat an event, if the event is Now for one of them, then it is Now for\nboth.\n\nUnlike QBism, CBism is not a subjective or personalist view of states\nand probabilities in physics. But both QBism and CBism depend on a\ngeneral view of science as an individual quest to organize one\u2019s\npast experiences and to anticipate one\u2019s future experiences.\nThis is a view that has antecedents even in views expressed by\nphysicists generally thought of as realists, such as Einstein (1949:\n673\u20134) and Bell, whom Mermin (2019: 8) quotes as follows:\n\n\nI think we invent concepts, like \u201cparticle\u201d or\n\u201cProfessor Peierls\u201d, to make the immediate sense of data\nmore intelligible. (J.S. Bell, letter to R.E. Peierls,\n24-February-1983)\n\n2. Objections and Replies\n2.1 Solipsist?\n\nA common reaction among those first hearing about QBism is to dismiss\nit as a form of solipsism. Mermin (2017) replies as follows:\n\n\nFacile charges of solipsism miss the point. My experience of you leads\nme to hypothesize that you are a being very much like myself, with\nyour own private experience. This is as firm a belief as any I have. I\ncould not function without it. If asked to assign this hypothesis a\nprobability I would choose 1.0.\nAlthough I have no direct personal access to your own experience, an\nimportant component of my private experience is the impact on me of\nyour efforts to communicate, in speech or writing, your verbal\nrepresentations of your own experience. Science is a collaborative\nhuman effort to find, through our individual actions on the world and\nour verbal communications with each other, a model for what is common\nto all of our privately constructed external worlds. Conversations,\nconferences, research papers, and books are an essential part of the\nscientific process. (84\u201385)\n\n\nIn his critical assessment of quantum Bayesianism, Timpson (2008)\noffers a more detailed defense against the charge of solipsism.\n\nBut even if one accepts the existence of other people and their\nexperiences, adopting QBism does seem severely to restrict one\u2019s\napplication of quantum theory to anticipations of one\u2019s own\nexperiences, with no implications for those of anyone else.\n2.2 Instrumentalist?\n\nBy portraying it as a tool for helping a user get by in an uncertain\nworld, QBism has been characterized as merely a form of\ninstrumentalism about quantum theory. But this is no reason to reject\nthe view absent arguments against such instrumentalism.\n\nInstrumentalism is usually contrasted with realism as a view of\nscience (see entry on\n scientific realism).\n The contrast is often taken to depend on opposing views of the\ncontent, aims, and epistemic reach of scientific theories. Crudely,\nthe realist takes theoretical statements to be either true or false of\nthe world, science to aim at theories that truly describe the world,\nand theories of mature science to have given us increasingly reliable\nand accurate knowledge even of things we can\u2019t observe: While\nthe instrumentalist takes theoretical statements to be neither true\nnor false of the world, science to aim only at theories that\naccommodate and predict our observations, and theories even in mature\nscience to have given us increasingly reliable and accurate\npredictions only of things we can observe.\n\nQBism offers a more nuanced view, both of quantum theory as a theory\nand of science in general. Fuchs (2017a) adopted the slogan\n\u201cparticipatory realism\u201d for the view of science he takes\nto emerge from QBism (if not also a variety of more or less related\nviews of quantum theory). For QBism a quantum state assignment is true\nor false relative to the epistemic state of the agent assigning it,\ninsofar as it corresponds to that agent\u2019s partial beliefs\nconcerning his or her future experiences (beliefs the agent should\nhave adopted in accordance with the Born Rule). But what makes this\nquantum state assignment true or false is not the physical world\nindependent of the agent.\n\nThe QBist does not take quantum theory truly to describe the world:\nbut (s)he does take that to be the aim of science\u2014an\naim to which quantum theory contributes only indirectly. For\nexample, the Born Rule in the form of Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\).\n\n\nis less agent-specific than any probability assignments themselves.\nIt\u2019s a rule that any agent should pick up and use\u2026. it\nlives at the level of the impersonal. And because of that, the Born\nRule correlates with something that one might want to call real.\n(Fuchs 2017: 119)\n\n\nFuchs thinks one thing quantum theory has taught us about the world is\nthat it is much richer than we may have thought: as agents using\nquantum theory to make wise decisions we are not just placing bets on\nan unknown but timelessly existing future but actively\ncreating that future reality: \u201creality is more than any\nthird-person perspective can capture\u201d. That is the sense in\nwhich he takes QBism to support a strong participatory realism, about\nthe world in and on which we act and about how science should describe\nit.\n\nBy contrast, Mermin 2019 draws related but possibly less radical\nconclusions about science that (perhaps contrary to his intentions)\nsome might interpret as a kind of instrumentalism or even\nphenomenalism:\n\n\n\u2026science in general, and quantum mechanics in particular, is a\ntool that each of us uses to organize and make sense of\nour own private experience. p.2\n\nThe fact is that my science has a subject (me) as well as an object\n(my world). Your science has a subject (you) as well as an object\n(your world). ... While each of us constructs a different world, the\nworld of science is our joint construction of the vast body of\nphenomena that we try to infer, through language, to be common to our\nown individual worlds. Science arises out of our use of language to\nindicate to each other our individual experiences out of which we each\nconstruct our own individual worlds. p.5\n\n2.3 Is QBist Quantum Theory Explanatory?\n\nRealists often appeal to scientific explanation when arguing against\ninstrumentalists. Quantum theory is generally acknowledged to provide\nus with a wide variety of successful explanations of phenomena we\ncan\u2019t explain without it. Timpson (followed by Brown 2019)\nobjects that QBists cannot account for its explanatory success.\n\n\n\u2026 think of the question of why some solids conduct and some\ninsulate; why yet others are in between, while they all contain\nelectrons, sometimes in quite similar densities\u2026. Ultimately we\nare not interested in agents\u2019 expectation that matter structured\nlike sodium would conduct; we are interested in why it in fact\ndoes so. (Timpson 2008: 600)\n\n\nQBists face two problems here. In their view a user of quantum theory\ncan\u2019t appeal to a description of objective, physical quantum\nstates in explaining the phenomena; and quantum theory\u2019s Born\nrule outputs subjective probabilities for each user independently that\nbear not on what is objectively likely to happen but only on what\n(s)he should expect to experience, given her prior beliefs and\nexperiences.\n\nFuchs and Schack (2015) reply that explanations offered by quantum\ntheory have a similar character to explanations offered by probability\ntheory and give examples. This does not address the first problem. But\nQBists could rationalize biting that bullet by pointing to\nlong-standing problems of measurement and non-locality faced by\ninterpretations that take quantum states to be physically real that\ndon\u2019t arise in their view. To respond to the second problem they\ncould try to develop a subjectivist view of scientific explanation as\nultimately a matter of making an economical and effective unity out of\nall an agent\u2019s beliefs and expectations.\n2.4 Is the Born Rule a New Bayesian Norm?\n\nBacciagaluppi (2014) has raised an objection against the claim that\nthe Born rule as formulated in Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) states an\nempirically motivated normative addition to Bayesian coherence\nconditions. His basic objection is that QBism assumes the probability\n\\(q(j)\\) of an actual measurement outcome (as also the probability\n\\(p(j)\\) of a hypothetical measurement outcome) is independent of the\nprocedure by which this measurement is performed. That this is so\nfollows from the usual formulation of the Born Rule relating Born\nprobabilities of measurement outcomes to quantum state assignments.\nBut QBism cannot justify the procedure-independence of \\(q(j)\\) and\n\\(p(j)\\) in this way because it considers the Born Rule in the form of\nEquation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) to be primitive, and so incapable of\nempirical support from the relation between quantum states and\noutcomes of laboratory procedures.\n\nThere are also technical problems with Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), which\nassumes the existence of SICs in the relevant Hilbert space. But\ninfinite as well as finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are used in\nquantum theory, and SICs have not (yet) been shown to exist in every\nfinite\n dimension.[4]\n Informationally-complete (but not necessarily symmetric) POVMs do\nexist in all finite dimensional spaces. Fuchs and Schack (2015) give a\nschematic alternative to Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\) that does not\nrequire symmetry of an informationally-complete POVM representing a\nhypothetical fiducial measurement.\n2.5 Is QBism too Subjective?\n\nThe QBist approach to quantum theory is often criticized as too\nsubjective in its treatment of quantum states, measurement outcomes,\nand probabilities.\n\nMany people assume a wave-function or state vector represents a\nphysical quantum state. On this assumption a quantum state is\nontic\u2014a fundamental element of reality obeying the quantum\ndynamics that underlies classical dynamical laws. Bacciagaluppi (2014)\nurges QBists to accept this approach to dynamics even while\nmaintaining a subjectivist or pragmatist interpretation of\nprobability. But doing so would undercut the QBist account of\ndiscontinuous change of quantum state on measurement as simply\ncorresponding to epistemic updating.\n\nMost people take it for granted that a competently performed quantum\nmeasurement procedure has a unique, objective outcome. QBists deny\nthis, assimilating a measurement outcome to an agent\u2019s personal\nexperience\u2014including her experience of another agent\u2019s\nverbal report of his outcome. QBists take a measurement outcome to be\npersonal to the agent whose action elicited it. This tenet is key both\nto QBist denial that quantum phenomena involve any nonlocal influence\n(Fuchs, Mermin and Schack 2014) and to the QBist (DeBrota, Fuchs and\nSchack 2020) resolution of the paradox of Wigner\u2019s friend (see\nthe entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics).\n But their notions of experience and agency are broad enough to\nencompass personal experiences of agents other than individual,\nconscious humans.\n\nBy rejecting the objective authority of observation reports QBists\nchallenge what many have considered a presupposition of the scientific\nmethod. This rejection also threatens to undercut the standard\npersonalist argument (see entry on\n Bayesian epistemology,\n \u00a76.2.F) that the opinions of agents with very different prior\ndegrees of belief will converge after they have accumulated sufficient\ncommon evidence.\n\nQBists consider a subjective view of quantum probability a core\ncommitment of the view, even when that probability is\n1 (Caves, Fuchs and Schack 2007). But Stairs (2011)\nand others have argued that QBist strategies for resolving conceptual\nproblems associated with non-locality may be co-opted by a qualified\nobjectivist about quantum probabilities.\n\nQBists identify probability 1 with an individual\nagent\u2019s subjective certainty, in contrast to the objective\ncertainty EPR took to entail the existence of a physical quantity\nwhose value could be predicted with probability 1.\nStairs (2011) referred to developments of David Lewis\u2019s (1986:\nAppendix C) best systems analysis as providing an alternative notion\nof objective probability in which this entailment fails (see entry on\n interpretations of probability,\n \u00a73.6). So QBist subjectivism about probability is not necessary\nto block the EPR inference to an element of reality (or beable, to use\nBell\u2019s term) grounding the objective certainty of Bob\u2019s\ndistant measurement outcome on his component of a non-separable system\nfollowing Alice\u2019s measurement on her component, thereby\nundercutting Bell\u2019s proof that quantum theory is not locally\ncausal.\n2.6 Should a QBist believe that an agent prepares a physically real state?\n\nA QBist is convinced that an agent should take quantum mechanics as a\nguide for setting her subjective degrees of belief about the outcomes\nof future measurements. Myrvold (2020a,b) has used results of Pusey,\nBarrett and Rudolph (2012) and Barrett, Cavalcanti, Lal, and Maroney\n(2014) to argue that anyone with that conviction should also believe\nthat preparations with which she associates distinct pure quantum\nstates result in ontically distinct states of affairs, a conclusion\nthat QBists reject.\n\nHis argument depends on results proved within the ontological models\nframework of Harrigan and Spekkens (2010). Myrvold defends this\nframework as merely codifying a form of reasoning implicit in much of\nscience and daily life which there is no good reason to reject when\napplied in the quantum domain. One reasons that an action on a\nphysical system affects what one will experience later only via the\nphysical transmission of that action\u2019s effect from the system to\nevents one later experiences. If so, then the action of preparing a\nsystem\u2019s quantum state must affect some physical property of the\nsystem reflected in what the framework calls its ontic state.\n\nIn response, QBists insist that quantum states have no ontic hold on\nthe world and that the QBist notion of quantum indeterminism is a far\nmore radical variety than anything proposed in the quantum debate\nbefore because it says that nature does what it wants, without a\nmechanism underneath (Fuchs 2017b, p. 272; 2018, p. 19). The QBist\nSchack rejects Myrvold\u2019s form of reasoning in the quantum domain\nas follows (Schack 2018).\n\n\nThere are no laws that determine objective probabilities for\nmeasurement outcomes. The world does not evolve according to a\nmechanism.\n\n2.7 Other Objections and Replies\n\nOther objections to QBism may be found in Brown (2019) and Zwirn\n(forthcoming).\n\nAccording to Brown (2019, p. 75) \u201c\u2026a variant of\nBerkeleyan idealism suffuses QBism.\u201d QBists insist on the\nexistence of a real world in which agents and their experiences are\nembedded, along with rocks, trees and everything else in the usual\nworld of common experience. But they deny that quantum mechanics\nitself describes this world, while hoping eventually to infer more\nabout it from our successful use of quantum mechanics to anticipate\neach of our experiences when acting on it. Brown objects to the\ncurrently ineffable character of the world for a QBist, contrasting\nthis unfavorably with the way a realist about a quantum state can use\nit to describe the physical world and explain how it gives rise to our\nexperiences by affecting our brains.\n\nBrown also objects to the QBists\u2019 understanding of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, assuming they consider this to track\nchanges not in the physical state of a quantum system but in what an\nagent believes she is likely to experience were she to act on it. But\nQBists understand this equation as a normative constraint on an\nagent\u2019s belief state at a single time, not as a constraint on\nhow that state evolves (see\n \u00a71.2).\n\nBrown further questions QBist entitlement to divide up the external\nworld, either into subsystems or spatiotemporally, complaining that\n\u201cThat part of QBism which relates to \u2018a theory of\nstimulation and response\u2019 between the agent and the world is not\ngrounded in known physics.\u201d (2019, p. 81)\n\nBarzegar (2020) has replied to Brown\u2019s objections. His reply\nincludes a defense of a claim by Fuchs (2017, p. 118) that Brown\n(2019) sought to refute\u2013\u2013the claim that QBism is pursuing\nEinstein\u2019s (1949) program of \u201cthe real\u201d.\n\nFollowing a largely sympathetic sketch of QBism, Zwirn (forthcoming,\n\u00a710) highlights ways in which some of its key notions remain\nunclear. Regarding quantum mechanics as an extension of subjective\nprobability theory, QBists (DeBrota and Stacey (2019), see\n Other Internet Resources)\n reject the demand to provide a reductive definition of the notion of\nan agent. Zwirn presses this demand because in this context the agent\nis not merely a passive witness: \u201cIt is the interaction between\nan agent and the external world that creates a result. Without agent,\nthere is no result.\u201d\n\nZwirn (forthcoming) also challenges QBists to clarify their key\nconcepts of world and experience: \u201cQBism\nendorses the existence of an external world independent of any agent,\nbut it is not clear if the external world is unique and shared by all\nagents or if each agent has her own external world.\u201d\n\nZwirn believes that his own view of Convivial Solipsism (Zwirn 2016,\n2020) improves on QBism because it provides clear answers to these\nchallenging questions. In his view an agent is something whose\nconscious experiences are produced by a common external physical\nworld, but organized into that agent\u2019s personal external\nworld.\n3. QBism and Pragmatism\n\nMost QBists are physicists rather than philosophers. But Fuchs locates\nQBism in the tradition of classical American pragmatism (see entry on\n pragmatism).\n While quoting Peirce and referring to Dewey, Fuchs (2011; 2016, Other\nInternet Resources) acknowledges especially the influence of William\nJames\u2019s ideas of pure experience and an open and pluralistic\nuniverse in which \u201cnew being comes in local spots and patches\nwhich add themselves or stay away at random, independently of the\nrest\u201d (2016, 9, Other Internet Resources). Mermin\u2019s CBist\nintroduction of the \u201cNow\u201d into physics and Fuchs\u2019s\nchoice of title for his 2014 (Other Internet Resources) both show\naffinity with James\u2019s reaction against what he called the\nblock-universe (see entry\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n Moreover, they both credit the influence on QBism of Niels Bohr. Bohr\nhimself never acknowledged pragmatist influences on his view of\nquantum theory. But in a late\n interview[5]\n he expressed enthusiasm for James\u2019s conception of\nconsciousness, and he was almost certainly acquainted with some of\nJames\u2019s ideas by the Danish philosopher H\u00f8ffding, a\nfriend and admirer of James.\n4. Pragmatist Views\n\nPragmatists agree with QBists that quantum theory should not be\nthought to offer a description or representation of physical reality:\nin particular, to ascribe a quantum state is not to describe physical\nreality. But they deny that this makes the theory in any way\nsubjective. It is objective not because it faithfully mirrors the\nphysical world, but because every individual\u2019s use of the theory\nis subject to objective standards supported by the common knowledge\nand goals of the scientific community. So an individual\u2019s\nassignment of a quantum state may be correct (or incorrect) even\nthough no quantum state is an element of physical reality; Born\nprobabilities are similarly objective; and measurement is a physical\nprocess with a unique objective outcome, albeit\nepistemically-characterized.\n4.1 Stapp\n\nIn attempting to clarify the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum\ntheory, Stapp called it pragmatic and used James\u2019s views on\ntruth and experience to provide an appropriate philosophical\nbackground for the Copenhagen interpretation \u201cwhich is\nfundamentally a shift to a philosophic perspective resembling that of\nWilliam James\u201d (1972: 1105).\n\nThe significance of this viewpoint for science is its negation of the\nidea that the aim of science is to construct a mental or mathematical\nimage of the world itself. According to the pragmatic view, the proper\ngoal of science is to augment and order our experience. (Stapp 1972:\n1104)\n\nHe follows Bohr (1958), Landau and Lifshitz (1977), and others in\ninsisting on the objective character of quantum measurements, taking\n\u201cour experience\u201d not as individual and subjective but as\nconstituted by physical events, on whose correct description in the\neveryday language of the laboratory we can (and must) all agree if\nphysical science is to continue its progress.\n4.2 B\u00e4chtold\n\nB\u00e4chtold (2008a,b) takes an approach to quantum theory he calls\npragmatist. Quoting C.S. Peirce\u2019s pragmatic maxim, he offers\nwhat he calls pragmatic definitions of terms used by researchers in\nmicrophysics, including \u201cpreparation\u201d,\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d, \u201cobservable\u201d, and\n\u201cmicroscopic system\u201d. His \u201cpragmatist\u201d\napproach to interpreting a theory is to isolate the pragmatic\nfunctions to be fulfilled by successful research activity in\nmicrophysics, and then to show that quantum theory alone fulfills\nthese functions.\n\nWhile acknowledging that his interpretation has an instrumentalist\nflavor, in his 2008a he distinguishes it from the instrumentalism of\nPeres (1995) and others, who all (allegedly) claim some metaphysical\nideas but seek to remove the expression \u201cmicroscopic\nsystem\u201d from the vocabulary used by quantum physicists. By\ncontrast, his \u201cpragmatic definition\u201d of that expression\nlicenses this usage, taking \u201cquantum system\u201d to refer to a\nspecified set of preparations.\n\nB\u00e4chtold (2008b: chapter 2) elaborates on his pragmatist\nconception of knowledge, appealing to a variety of philosophical\nprogenitors, including Peirce, James, Carnap, Wittgenstein, Putnam,\nand Kant. But his overall approach to quantum theory has strong\naffinities with operationalist approaches to the theory.\n4.3 Healey\n\nIn recent work, Healey (2012a,b, 2017a,b, 2020) has also taken what he\ncalls a pragmatist approach to quantum theory. He contrasts this with\ninterpretations that attempt to say what the world would (or could) be\nlike if quantum theory were true of it. On his approach quantum states\nare objective, though a true quantum state assignment does not\ndescribe or represent the condition or behavior of a physical system.\nBut quantum states are relational: Different agents may correctly and\nconsistently assign different quantum states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances\u2014not because these represent their subjective\npersonal beliefs, but because each agent has access to different\nobjective information backing these (superficially conflicting) state\nassignments. Each such assignment may be said to correctly represent\nobjective probabilistic relations between its backing conditions and\nclaims about values of magnitudes.\n\nOn this approach, quantum theory is not about agents or their states\nof belief: and nor does it (directly) describe the physical world. It\nis a source of objectively good advice about how to describe\nthe world and what to believe about it as so described. This advice is\ntailored to meet the needs of physically situated, and hence\ninformationally-deprived, agents like us. It is good because the\nphysical world manifests regular statistical patterns the right Born\nprobabilities help a situated agent to predict and explain. But the\nadvice is available even with no agents in a position to benefit from\nit: there are quantum states and Born probabilities in possible worlds\nwith no agents.\n\nBorn probabilities are neither credences nor frequencies. They are\nobjective because they are authoritative. Setting credences equal to\nBorn probabilities derived from the correct quantum state for one in\nthat physical situation is a wise epistemic policy for any agent in a\nworld like ours. Born probabilities are equally objective even when\nthey differ more radically from Lewis\u2019s (1986) chances because\nthey are based on more (physically) limited information.\n\nHealey\u2019s approach is pragmatist in several respects. It\nprioritizes use over representation in its general approach to quantum\ntheory; its account of probability and causation is pragmatist, in\nquantum theory and elsewhere; and it rests on a theory of content that\nBrandom (2000) calls inferentialist pragmatism. While not endorsing\nany pragmatist identification of truth with \u201cwhat works\u201d,\nin its deflationary approach to truth and representation it follows\nthe contemporary pragmatist Huw Price (2003, 2011). Healey (2020)\nargues for a conception of realism according to which this pragmatist\napproach is realist rather than anti-realist.\n4.3.1 Contrasts with QBism\n\nIndependently of similar suggestions by Bacciagaluppi (2014) and\nStairs (2011), Healey co-opts some QBist strategies for dissolving the\nmeasurement problem and removing worries about non-locality, while\nrejecting the accompanying subjectivism about quantum states, Born\nprobabilities, and measurement outcomes.\n\nWhile QBists take quantum state assignments to be subject only to the\ndemand that an agent\u2019s degrees of belief be coherent and conform\nto Equation \\((\\ref{ex2})\\), Healey takes these to be answerable to\nthe statistics of objective events, including (but not restricted to)\noutcomes of quantum measurements. This makes the objective existence\nof quantum states independent of that of agents even though their main\nfunction is as a source of good advice to any agents there happen to\nbe. And it makes quantum states relative, not to the epistemic\nsituation of actual agents, but to the physical situation of actual\nand merely hypothetical agents.\n\nWhile QBists follow de Finetti in taking all probabilities to be\ncredences of actual agents, Healey\u2019s pragmatist takes\nprobabilities to exist independently of the existence of agents but\nnot to be physical propensities or frequencies, nor even to supervene\non Lewis\u2019s Humean mosaic (see entry on\n David Lewis\n \u00a75). There are probabilities insofar as probability statements\nare objectively true, which they may be when sensitive to though not\ndetermined by physical facts.\n\nThere is no measurement problem since reassignment of quantum state on\nmeasurement is not a physical process but corresponds to\nrelativization of that state to a different physical situation from\nwhich additional information has become physically accessible to a\nhypothetical agent so situated.\n\nThere is no instantaneous action at a distance in a quantum world,\ndespite the probabilistic counterfactual dependencies between\nspace-like separated events such as (macroscopic) outcomes of\nmeasurements confirming violation of Bell inequalities. On a\npragmatist approach, these dependencies admit no conceptual\npossibility of intervention on one outcome that would alter (any\nrelevant probability of) the other. So there is no instantaneous\nnon-local influence, in conformity to Einstein\u2019s principle of\nlocal action.\n4.3.2 Decoherence and Content\n\nOn Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach, an application of the Born rule\ndirectly specifies probabilities for claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes (dynamical variables of classical physics as well\nas new variables such as strangeness and color): it does not\nexplicitly specify probabilities for measurement outcomes. But the\nBorn rule is legitimately applied only to claims with sufficiently\nwell-defined content. The content of a claim about the value of a\nphysical magnitude on a system depends on how the system interacts\nwith its environment. Quantum theory may be used to model such\ninteraction. Only if a system\u2019s quantum state is then stably\ndecohered in some basis (see entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics)\n do claims about the value of the associated \u201cpointer\nmagnitude\u201d acquire a sufficiently well-defined content to\nlicense application of the Born rule to them. Because of this\nrestriction on its legitimate application, the Born rule may be\nconsistently applied to claims of this form (not just to claims about\nthe outcomes of measurements) without running afoul of no-go results\nsuch as that of Kochen and Specker (see entry on\n the Kochen-Specker theorem).\n\nWhat endows a claim (e.g., about the value of a magnitude) with\ncontent is the web of inferences in which it is located. Such a claim\nhas a well-defined content if many reliable inferences link it to\nother claims with well-defined content. It is the nature of a\nsystem\u2019s interaction with its environment that determines which\ninferences to and from a magnitude claim about it are reliable.\nQuantum decoherence and inferentialist pragmatism work together here\nto make objective sense of the Born rule with no need to mention\nmeasurement: Though of course at some stage all actual measurements do\ninvolve interactions with an environment well modeled by quantum\ndecoherence.\n\nContra to Mermin\u2019s view (see\n \u00a71.6),\n concepts are not invented by each of us to make his or her experience\nmore intelligible. They acquire content from the social practice of\nlinguistic communication about a physical world that perception\nrepresents (to humans as well as organisms with no capacity for\nlanguage) as independently existing.\n4.3.3 Objections and Replies\n\nJansson (2020) challenges the claim of Healey\u2019s pragmatist\napproach to offer objective explanations of phenomena, while\nacknowledging the attractions of a position that seeks to occupy the\nmiddle ground between explanation seeking realism and prediction\nfocused instrumentalism. She concludes (2020: 165) that\n\n\nMany explanations according to this approach to quantum theory seem to\nat least partially black-box crucial information about the physical\nground for the appropriate assignment of quantum states or\napplications of the Born rule. \u2026neither quantum states nor the\nBorn rule can act as initial explanatory input. While this is a\nserious cost, it is not clear that a pragmatist approach to quantum\ntheory has to resist this conclusion.\n\n\nOne taking Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach to quantum theory could\nreply as follows (see Healey 2020, \u00a77.7). The primary target of\nan explanatory application of quantum theory is not a collection of\nevents but a probabilistic phenomenon they manifest. A probabilistic\nphenomenon is a probabilistic data model of a statistical regularity.\nOne explains the phenomenon by demonstrating how the probabilities of\nthe model are a consequence of the Born rule, as applied to events\nthat manifest the regularity. Since the explanandum is not\nitself a physical condition, it is inappropriate to demand a physical\nexplanans (such as a physically real quantum state). But the\ndemonstration is explanatory only if each event manifesting the\nregularity itself depended on whatever physical conditions obtained,\nincluding whatever conditions backed assignment of the quantum state\ninput to the Born rule. One can have good evidence for such backing\nconditions while unable to specify exactly what they are. The more\ncomplete the description of the physical conditions on which each\nevent manifesting the regularity depended, the better the explanation\nof the probabilistic phenomenon they manifest.\n\nLewis (2020) raises concerns about Healey\u2019s application of\ninferentialist pragmatism to the content of claims in quantum theory\nand its applications. His first worry concerns the distinction between\nthe prescriptive content of quantum claims (about the quantum state,\nfor example) and descriptive non-quantum claims about magnitudes like\nposition and energy.\n\nBut, as he notes, a claim\u2019s having a distinctive prescriptive\nfunction does not show that it has no representational content. A\npragmatist could reply that a quantum state represents something other\nthan an \u201celement of physical reality\u201d while functioning to\nprescribe credences about such elements: Healey (2017a) suggests that\na quantum state represents probabilistic relations between them.\n\nLewis\u2019s second worry is that Healey\u2019s position fails to\nadequately take into account the role of conditional or counterfactual\ninferences in conferring content both on quantum, and on non-quantum\nmagnitude, claims. Through its prescriptive role in applications of\nthe Born rule, Lewis maintains, a claim about a quantum state or a\nmagnitude implies many counterfactual probabilistic claims about\nmagnitudes. For an inferentialist then, quantum claims and magnitude\nclaims derive content from the corresponding inferences.\n\nOn Healey\u2019s (2017, pp. 208\u2013210) pragmatist approach, a\nclaim assigning a quantum state does derive much of its content from\ninferences involving counterfactuals. The inference is to a\ncounterfactual whose antecedent is (or supervenes on) a claim about\nmagnitudes, and whose consequent specifies a probability as great as\n1 for a different magnitude claim that is meaningful\nin these counterfactual circumstances. Healey could argue that the\nmagnitude claims Lewis considers do not derive content from his\ncorresponding counterfactuals, on the grounds that they do not\nmaterially imply those counterfactuals and so in quantum theory an\ninference from the claim to the counterfactual is not reliable.\nAccording to Healey\u2019s inferentialist pragmatism, only reliable\nmaterial inferences confer content. Magnitude claims about the\ntrajectory of a molecule might be meaningful and true according to an\nalternative theory such as\n Bohmian mechanics.\n But in Healey\u2019s pragmatist view (2012b, pp. 1547\u20138), even\nan imprecise claim about the location and velocity of a molecule is\ntrue only in a situation that can be modeled by decoherence of a kind\nthat would block the inference to the counterfactual.\n\nLewis\u2019s final worry is that this application of inferentialist\npragmatism renders the content of a claim highly sensitive to the\nphysical environment of the system concerned. He correctly notes that,\non this pragmatist approach, quantum theory requires acknowledgement\nof radical changes to physical concepts that do not flow from other\napplications of pragmatism.\n\nOne taking Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach might respond to this\nworry by noting that these conceptual changes are a straightforward\nconsequence of the application of inferentialist pragmatism to quantum\ntheory. For an inferentialist pragmatist, a material inference can\ncontribute to the content of a claim only if it is reliable, but in\nthe quantum domain physical inferences of a sort we all make in\neveryday life fail dramatically. The sensitivity of physical concepts\nto a system\u2019s physical environment is arguably the natural\nresult of reconfiguring our physical concepts to restore the\nreliability of inferences involving them.\n5. Related Views\n\nThe view that a quantum state describes physical reality is sometimes\ncalled \\(\\psi\\)-ontic, by contrast with a \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic view that\nit represents an agent\u2019s incomplete information about an\nunderlying physical state. When Harrigan and Spekkens (2010)\noriginally defined these terms they applied them only to what they\ncalled ontic models of quantum theory. But others have since used them\nmore broadly to classify alternative views of quantum states outside\nof the ontological models framework. QBists and pragmatists are not\nthe only ones to adopt a view that is neither \\(\\psi\\)-ontic nor\n\\(\\psi\\)-epistemic in these broader senses. Other views share the\npragmatist thought that quantum states aren\u2019t a function of any\nagent\u2019s actual epistemic state because quantum state assignments\nare required to conform to objective standards of correctness. This\nsection covers two such views.\n5.1 Friederich\n\nFriederich (2011, 2015) favors what he calls a therapeutic approach to\ninterpreting quantum theory, taking his cue from the later philosophy\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein. This approach grounds the objectivity of\nquantum state assignments in the implicit constitutive rules governing\nthis practice. Those rules determine the state an agent has to assign\ndepending on her knowledge of the values of observables, perhaps\nobtained by consulting the outcome of their measurement on the system.\nFriederich agrees with Healey that differently situated agents may\ntherefore have to assign different states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances insofar as their situations permit some to consult\noutcomes inaccessible to others, and makes the point by saying a\nsystem is not \\(in\\) whichever quantum state it is assigned.\n\nFriederich treats quantum probabilities as rational quasi-Lewisian\nconstraints on credence and, together with his relational account of\nquantum states, this enables him to refute the claim that Bell\u2019s\ntheorem demonstrates instantaneous action at a distance. He uses (what\nhe calls) his epistemic conception of quantum states to dissolve the\nmeasurement problem by denying that an entangled superposition of\nsystem and apparatus quantum states is incompatible with the\noccurrence of a definite, unique outcome. Like Healey, he appeals to\ndecoherence in picking out the particular observable(s) a suitable\ninteraction may be considered to measure.\n\nSo far Friederich\u2019s therapeutic approach parallels\nHealey\u2019s pragmatist approach (though there are significant\ndifferences of detail, especially as regards their treatments of\nprobability and causation). But Friederich rejects Healey\u2019s\ninferentialist account of the content of claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes, taking restrictions on legitimate applications of\nthe Born Rule to follow directly from the constitutive rules governing\nits use rather than from the need to apply it only to magnitude claims\nwith well-defined content. And Friederich seriously explores the\npossibility that a set of magnitude claims collectively assigning a\nprecise value to all dynamical variables may be not only\nmeaningful but true together. His idea is that the constitutive rules\ngoverning the Born Rule may forbid any attempt to apply the rule in a\nway that would imply the existence of a non-contextual probability\ndistribution over their possible values, thus avoiding conflict with\nno-go theorems like that of Kochen and Specker.\n5.2 Brukner and Zeilinger\n\nBrukner and Zeilinger (2003), Zeilinger (2005) follow Schr\u00f6dinger\n(1935) and many others in viewing a quantum state as a catalogue of\nour knowledge about a system. Their view is not \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic\nbecause it denies that the system has an ontic state about\nwhich we may learn by observing it. Instead, a system is characterized\nby its information content. An elementary system contains information\nsufficient to answer one question. For a spin \u00bd system, a\nquestion about spin component in any direction may be answered by a\nsuitable observation. But the answer cannot typically be understood as\nrevealing the pre-existing value of spin-component in that direction,\nand answering this question by observation randomizes the answer to\nany future question about spin-component in different directions. So\nthe catalog of knowledge takes the form of a probability distribution\nover possible answers to all meaningful question about a quantum\nsystem that contains only one entry with probability 1 that might be\nconsidered a property that would be revealed if observed.\n\nBrukner (2018) has recently used an extension of Wigner\u2019s friend\nparadox (Wigner 1962) to argue that even the answers to such questions\ngiven by observation cannot be regarded as reflecting objective\nproperties of the devices supposedly recording them. If sound, such an\nargument provides a reason to modify this view of quantum states to\nmake it closer to that of QBists.\n6. Conclusion\n\nA variety of QBist and pragmatist views of quantum theory have been\nproposed since quantum theory assumed close to its present form. In\nrecent years this has been an active area of research especially by\nphilosophically aware physicists working in quantum foundations.\nPhilosophers have tended to dismiss such approaches, objecting to\ntheir instrumentalism and/or anti-realism. But there is much to learn\nfrom responses to such objections and good philosophical\nreasons to take these views more seriously.\n",
