    "preamble": "\n\nThe manifest appearance of function and purpose in living systems is\nresponsible for the prevalence of apparently teleological explanations\nof organismic structure and behavior in biology. Although the\nattribution of function and purpose to living systems is an ancient\npractice, teleological notions are largely considered ineliminable\nfrom modern biological sciences, such as evolutionary biology,\ngenetics, medicine, ethology, and psychiatry, because they play an\nimportant explanatory role. \n\nHistorical and recent examples of teleological claims include the\nfollowing: \n\n\nThe chief function of the heart is the transmission and pumping of the\nblood through the arteries to the extremities of the body. (Harvey\n1616 [1928: 49]) \n\nThe Predator Detection hypothesis remains the strongest candidate for\nthe function of stotting [by gazelles]. (Caro 1986: 663) \n\nThe geographic range of human malaria is much wider than the range of\nthe sickle-cell gene. As it happens, other antimalarial genes take\nover the protective function of the sickle-cell gene in \u2026 other\nwarm parts. (Diamond 1994: 83) \n\nDespite the substantial amount of data we now have on theropod\ndinosaurs, more information is necessary in order to determine the\nlikelihood that early feathers served an adaptive function in visual\ndisplay as opposed to other proposed adaptive functions such as\nthermoregulation. (Dimond et al. 2011: 62) \n\n\nThe ubiquity of claims such as these raises the question: how should\napparently teleological notions in biology be understood? \n\nMost post-Darwinian approaches attempt to naturalize teleology in\nbiology, in opposition to nineteenth-century viewpoints which grounded\nit theologically. Nevertheless, biologists and philosophers have\ncontinued to question the legitimacy of teleological notions in\nbiology. For instance, Ernst Mayr (1988), identified four reasons why\nteleological notions remain controversial in biology, namely that they\nare: \n\nvitalistic (positing some special \u2018life-force\u2019); \nrequiring backwards causation (because goal-directed explanations\nseem to use future outcomes to explain present traits); \nincompatible with mechanistic explanation (because of 1 and 2);\n\nmentalistic (attributing the action of mind where there is none).\n\n\n\nA fifth complaint is that they are not empirically testable (Allen\n& Bekoff 1995). The current philosophical literature offers both\nDarwinian and non-Darwinian accounts of teleology in biology that aim\nto avoid these concerns. In this article, we hope to bring some\nclarity to the contemporary debates over the role of teleological\nnotions in biology by sketching a taxonomy of the various accounts of\nbiological function on offer (see Allen & Bekoff 1995 for a more\ncomprehensive taxonomy that forms the basis of this presentation). We\nprimarily focus on naturalistic accounts of biological function, since\nthis is where we see the most lively and productive current debates\n(see, e.g., Garson 2016 for an extended survey). We also briefly\ndiscuss the notion of goal-directedness in section 2. \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Framing the Debate\n\nThe discussion about biological teleology has ancient origins. It is\nparticularly prominent in Plato\u2019s depiction of the divine\nCraftsman or \u2018Demiurge\u2019 in the\n Timaeus\n and Aristotle\u2019s discussion of final causes in the\nPhysics (see the section on teleology in the entry on\n Aristotle).\n However, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s understanding of\nteleology, as well as their arguments for teleology in the natural\nworld, are distinct (Lennox 1992; Ariew 2002; Johnson 2005). Whereas Plato\u2019s\nteleology is anthropocentric and creationist, Aristotle\u2019s is\nnaturalistic and functional. On the Platonic view, the Demiurge is the\nsource of all motion in both the heavens and on earth, and the\nuniverse and all living beings within it are artifacts modeled on the\nForms (see the relevant sections of the entries on\n Plato\n and\n Plato\u2019s metaphysics).\n The goal toward which all things, including living beings, are\ndirected is the external and eternal good of the Forms. In contrast,\non the Aristotelian view, the teleology that directs the behavior of\nliving beings is immanent. For instance, in organismal development,\nthe impetus for this goal-directed process is a principle of change\nwithin the organism, and the telos, or goal, of the development is\nalso an inherent property. Although often conflated, the views of\nPlato and Aristotle on teleology have been influential in historical\ndebates on biological teleology, and one can still find Platonic and\nAristotelian ideas in the current debate on biological functions. \n\nIn addition to its role within ancient philosophy and cosmology,\nteleology has long been an important topic within physiology and\nmedicine. Galen\u2019s On the Use of the Parts (De usu\npartium) is an early example of teleological reasoning applied to\nphysiology (see the section on teleology in the entry on\n Galen).\n In this text, Galen presents a functional analysis of the various\nparts of living organisms, in which \u201cexistence, structure, and\nattributes of all the parts must be explained by reference to their\nfunctions in promoting the activities of the whole organism\u201d\n(Schiefsky 2007: 371). For Galen, a teleological account of parts is\nsuperior to a purely causal-mechanical one, since the function or\npurpose of the part plays an ineliminable role in the explanation of\nthe part and its activities. This Galenic view of anatomy, with its\nexplicitly Aristotelian reliance on final causes, largely dominated\nmedical thought until the seventeenth century. William Harvey\u2019s\nOn the Motion of the Heart and Blood (De motu\ncordis) was seen by many of his contemporaries (e.g., Hobbes,\nDescartes) as a turning point away from the Galenic or Aristotelian\napproaches to anatomy, with their appeal to final causes, toward the\nnew mechanistic and experimental science of the seventeenth century\n(French 1994).  His attempt to empirically establish the structure and\nmotion of the heart without ever claiming to have identified the final\ncause of circulation, as well as his use of mechanical analogies, such\nas the analogy from the expansion of the arteries to the inflation of\na glove, provide some support for this assessment. Robert Boyle,\nhowever, offered a different interpretation of Harvey\u2019s\nwork. Boyle saw it as amenable to his \u2018compatibilist\u2019\napproach that attempted to show that \u201cmechanical and\nteleological explanations of biological phenomena are\ncompatible\u201d (Lennox 1983: 38).  Recent commentators have also\nsuggested Harvey was strongly influenced by Aristotelian teleological\nthinking, and thus is a liminal figure in the transition from vitalist\nto purely mechanistic explanation in physiology and medicine\n(Distelzweig 2014, 2016; Lennox 2017), although Lennox notes that\n\u201cHarvey appears to be pressing the analogy between art and\nnature in ways that are not Aristotelian but more Platonic in\nspirit\u201d (Lennox 2017: 191).\n\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s analysis of teleology in the Critique of\nJudgment (Kant 1790 [2000]) also played an influential role in\nbiology. According to Kant, humans inevitably understand living things\nas if they are teleological systems (Zammito 2006). However, on\nKant\u2019s view, the teleology we see in the natural world is only\napparent; it is the product of our limited cognitive faculties (see\nsection 3 of the entry on\n Kant\u2019s aesthetics).\n But in addition, according to Kant, there is a certain\nnon-machine-like character of organisms, evident in their ability to\ngrow and reproduce, that leads to a type of mechanical\ninexplicability. Hannah Ginsborg (2004) argues that for Kant this\nimpossibility of explaining organisms in solely mechanistic terms does\nnot itself distinguish them from complex artifacts; but, she argues,\nKant thought that the regenerative and reproductive aspects of\norganisms lead us to attribute a kind of natural purposiveness that is\nabsent in artifacts, paralleling Aristotle\u2019s justification for\nnatural, immanent teleology. Kantian analysis of this sort shows up in\nearly nineteenth century research in what would come to be called\norganic chemistry. Scientists at that time sought to determine whether\nliving systems were nothing more than complex chemical systems, fully\nanalyzable in terms of physical and chemical processes. Those\nresearchers adopting a Kantian approach advocated a teleo-mechanist\nstrategy to make sense of the goal-directed nature of living systems,\nwhich sought to treat the organism as both a means and an end and thus\nincorporated elements of both teleological and mechanistic explanation\n(Lenoir 1982). \n\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the status of teleology in biology was \nalso contested as part of the vitalist-mechanist debate in physiology \nand medicine (for an overview, see the first section of the entry on\n life).\n Whereas mechanists sought to describe all living things in purely\nmechanical terms, vitalists argued that physical properties alone\ncould not explain the goal-directed organization of living things.\nThey claimed that \u2018vital forces\u2019 were also necessary to\nexplain the difference between physical and living systems. Although\nthey fell out of favor, some vitalist accounts persisted through the\ntwentieth-century, for instance, in philosopher Henri Bergson\u2019s\n\u2018\u00e9lan vital\u2019 (see the section creative\nevolution in the entry on\n Bergson)\n and in biologist-cum-philosopher Hans Driesch\u2019s concept of\n\u2018entelechy\u2019 (Driesch 1908). \n\nMuch debate over the role of teleology in biology in the twentieth\ncentury, especially amongst the architects of the \u2018modern\nsynthesis\u2019, traces back to Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of\nevolution by natural selection. Biologist and philosopher Michael\nGhiselin, expressing a common interpretation of Darwin\u2019s role in\nthis debate, claims in his preface to Darwin\u2019s work on orchids\nthat Darwin\u2019s theory succeeded in \u201cgetting rid of\nteleology and replacing it with a new way of thinking about\nadaptation\u201d (Darwin 1862/1877 [1984: xiii] cited in Lennox 1993:\n409). On this view, the theory of natural selection explains how\nspecies \u201chave been modified so as to acquire that perfection of\nstructure and co-adaptation\u201d without any appeal to a benevolent\nCreator (Darwin 1859: 3). Prior to Darwin, the best explanation for\nbiological adaptation was the argument from design, most influentially\npresented in William Paley\u2019s Natural Theology (Paley\n1802): living things have the structure and behaviors that they do\nbecause they were designed for certain purposes by a benevolent\nCreator (see the entry\non natural theology and natural religion).\nDarwin\u2019s theory provides\nbiology with the resources to resist this argument, offering a fully\nnaturalized explanation for adaptation. Although most agree that\nDarwin\u2019s theory does indeed purge evolutionary biology of any\nillicit appeal to external, Platonic teleology, there is disagreement\nas to whether or not Darwin\u2019s evolutionary explanations are\nteleological (see the relevant section of the entry on\n Darwinism).\n Even Darwin\u2019s contemporaries disagreed as to whether or not the\ntheory of natural selection purged teleological explanations from\nbiology or revived them (Lennox 2010). In any case, it is clear that\nDarwin used the language of \u2018final causes\u2019 to describe the\nfunction of biological parts in his Species Notebooks and throughout\nhis life; he also reflected frequently about the relationship between\nnatural selection and teleology (Lennox 1993). \n2. Explanatory Teleonaturalism\n\nPhilosophical naturalism\n denotes a broad range of attitudes towards ontological questions. We\nuse \u201cteleonaturalism\u201d to denote a similarly broad range of\nnaturalistic accounts of teleology in biology that are united in\nrejecting any dependence on mental or intentional notions in\nexplicating the use of the teleological terms in biological contexts.\nThus, those who reject teleomentalism typically seek truth conditions\nfor teleological claims in biology that are grounded in non-mental\nfacts about organisms and their traits. \n\nSome teleonaturalists analyze teleological language as primarily\ndescriptive rather than explanatory, maintaining that teleology in\nbiology is appropriate for biological systems which show purposive,\ngoal-directed patterns of behavior (for which Pittendrigh (1958)\ncoined the term \u201cteleonomic\u201d). For such views, the primary\nscientific challenge is to explain teleonomy, not to use teleonomy as\nexplanans (see Thompson 1987). While cybernetics lost its appeal in\nthe latter part of the twentieth century, more recent approaches to\nliving systems that treat them as self-organizing or\n\u201cautopoietic\u201d (Maturana & Varela 1980) bear certain\naffinities to the descriptive attitude towards\nteleonaturalism\u2014although most proponents claim that the concepts\ndeveloped within these approaches are explanatory. \n\nHence, most teleonaturalists favor accounts of biological function\nwhich make the explanatory role of this notion a desideratum.\nNaturalistic accounts typically aim to satisfy two additional\ndesiderata. They should distinguish genuine biological functions from\naccidental utility (such as noses supporting glasses), and they should\ncapture the normative dimension of function in order to preserve a\nfunction-malfunction distinction. Although these three desiderata are\nneither universally accepted nor are they adequacy conditions in the\nstrict sense, they have nevertheless achieved canonical status within\nthe contemporary debate over biological functions. \n\nIn the subsequent sections we divide various ways in which different\nteleonaturalist accounts of function can be distinguished. Our first\ndistinction is between (a) views which assimilate functional\nexplanations in biology to patterns of explanation in the\nnon-biological sciences, and (b) views treat functional explanation as\ndistinctively biological. \n3. Assimilation to Non-Biological Explanations\n\nErnest Nagel (1961) and Carl Hempel (1965) provide early attempts by\nphilosophers of science to directly assimilate functional explanation\nin biology to more general patterns of explanation. In particular,\nthey both consider functional explanation within the framework of the\n Deductive-Nomological account of scientific explanation.\n They consider the functional claims to be related to explanations of\nthe presence of a trait in an organism. Their accounts differ\nprimarily on whether to say that a trait T has function\nF in organism O when T is sufficient to produce\nF in O (Hempel\u2019s version) or when T is\nnecessary to produce F in O (Nagel\u2019s version).\n\n\nLarry Wright (1973, 1976) also offers an explanatory account targeted\non the presence of the trait, but he criticizes the prior accounts for\nfailing to capture the apparent goal-directedness of functional\ntraits. His so-called \u201cetiological\u201d analysis holds that\nthe function of X is Z means (a) X is there\nbecause it does Z, and (b) Z is a consequence (or\nresult) of X\u2019s being there. Because of the intended\nbreadth of Wright\u2019s analysis, it has been attacked on conceptual\ngrounds (e.g., Boorse 1976), but the general thrust of the etiological\naccount survives in accounts of function based on natural selection,\ndiscussed in section 4. \n\nCummins (1975) criticized both Hempel and Nagel on the grounds that\nthe proper target of explanation of biological function claims is not\nthe presence of a trait, but the capacities of biological organs and\norganisms. Sophisticated capacities can be analyzed in terms of the\ncontributions that their components make to those capacities. For\nexample, the heart of a bilaterian animal pumps blood, which in this\nway contributes to the capacity of the organism to deliver oxygen and\nnutrients to its tissues. The heart itself can be further decomposed\ninto parts (chambers, valves, etc.) which each play different\nfunctional roles in contributing to that organ\u2019s capacity to\npump blood. Among philosophers, this approach to functional analysis\nis most associated with Cummins (1975), although biologists have\nadvanced similar ideas, sometimes independently (Hinde 1975; Lauder\n1982), and indeed the approach can be traced much further back, as the\nquotation from William Harvey in the introduction suggests.\nCummins\u2019 ideas about functional analysis have been incorporated\nin recent discussion on mechanisms in the biological sciences (see the\nentry on\n mechanisms in science).\n For instance, Craver (2007) explicitly draws on Cummins (1975) in his\naccount and is important for moving teleological descriptions down to\nthe molecular level (see also, Craver 2001, 2013). \n\nAccording to Cummins, although biological systems certainly have\ncapacities that are uniquely biological, there is nothing specifically\nbiological about the pattern of explanation offered by functional\nanalysis; it applies equally well, for example to the contributions\nmade by the components of artifacts (Lewens 2004), for example the\ncontributions of the engine\u2019s pistons in the capacity of an\nautomobile to transport people. Because of the generality of the\nframework, it is also possible to give a functional analysis of how\nsome part of a biological system contributes to outcomes usually\ntreated as negative, such as disease or death. Some commentators\nregard this as a virtue of the approach, while others regard it as too\ndetached from standard biological practice. Relatedly, the functional\nanalysis approach fails to live up to the commonly-held desideratum that\nan adequate account should provide an analysis of malfunction\u2014a\ndesideratum that Cummins explicitly rejects (see also Wouters 1999 and\nDavies 2001). A heart with a hole in its septum may not circulate\nblood at a level sufficient to sustain life, but it thereby simply\nlacks that function. \n4. Natural Selection Accounts\n\nMany philosophers of biology believe that functional explanation is\nuniquely appropriate to biology, turning to Darwin\u2019s theory of\ndescent with modification to ground the practice of attributing\nfunctions. Like Wright, Hempel, and Nagel, natural-selection\nteleonaturalists take the primary target of explanation to be the\npresence of various traits in organisms. \n\nHere we distinguish between two ways of using natural selection to\nground biological teleology. \n\nIndirect approaches treat the adaptive, self-organizing nature of\nliving cells and organisms as the natural basis for teleological\nproperties of their traits, but give background credit to the power of\nnatural selection to produce such self-organizational complexity as is\nfound in living systems. \nDirect approaches invoke natural selection explicitly when\nexplicating functional claims, either in an etiological sense based on\nthe history of selection or in a dispositional sense based on the\nfitness of organisms possessing the traits. \n\n4.1 Indirect\n\nThe primary motivation for the earliest indirect, cybernetic accounts\nof biological teleology were to explain the apparent purposiveness of\nbiological organisms, for instance, the maintenance of constant body\ntemperature in endotherms. These accounts aimed to provide a\nnaturalized explanation for the goal-directed behavior of biological\nsystems through reference to their organization. In an influential\nearly paper, Norbert Wiener and colleagues sought to explain the\ngoal-directed behavior of biological organisms and machines as arising\nfrom their utilization of negative feedback mechanisms (Rosenblueth et\nal. 1943; for further development see also Braithwaite (1953),\nSommerhoff (1950) and Nagel (1953)). Attributions of teleological, or\ngoal-directed, behavior to animals or machines, they argued, meant\nnothing more than \u201cpurpose controlled by feed-back\u201d (Rosenblueth et al. 1943, 23). \n\nThis cybernetic account of teleology inspired biologist Colin\nPittendrigh to introduce the term \u2018teleonomy\u2019 into the\nliterature (Pittendrigh 1958). With this neologism, Pittendrigh hoped\nto purge biology of any vestiges of Aristotelian final causes whilst\nproviding biology with an acceptable term to describe adapted,\ngoal-directed systems. This term was taken up in the 1960s by\nevolutionary biologists such as Ernst Mayr (1974) and George Williams\n(1966), as well as by scientists studying cell metabolism and\nregulation, who were just beginning to elucidate the structural and\nmolecular basis for cellular feedback mechanisms (Monod & Jacob\n1961; Davis 1961). According to proponents, adopting a cybernetic\naccount of goal-directed behavior in biological systems splits the\nexplanatory problem in two. On the one hand, teleological activity in\nthe biological world could be explained by the presence of teleonomic\nsystems with negative feedback mechanisms, whereas the very presence\nof those teleonomic systems in living organisms, on the other hand,\ncould be explained by the action of natural selection (Monod 1970\n[1971]). \n\nAlthough explicit cybernetic accounts of biological teleology have\nfallen out of favor, other organizational approaches to biological\nfunction have had a recent resurgence in the function literature.\nThese organizational, or systems-theoretic, approaches often build\nupon early cybernetic accounts or aim to extend Maturana and\nVarela\u2019s (1980) influential notion of autopoiesis, which refers\nto the self-organizing, self-maintaining characteristic of living\nsystems (see the entry on\n Embodied Cognition\n for further description). These accounts identify the function of a\nbiological trait through an analysis of the role the trait plays\nwithin an organized system in contributing to both its own persistence\nand the persistence of the system as a whole (Schlosser 1998;\nMcLaughlin 2001; Mossio et al. 2009; Saborido et al. 2011; Moreno\n& Mossio 2015). Although they differ in their details,\norganizational approaches to biological function generally agree that\na trait token T has a function F when the performance of\nF by T contributes to the maintenance of the complex\norganization of the system, which in turn results in T\u2019s\ncontinued existence. For example, the heart has the function to pump\nblood, according to these accounts, because it contributes to the\nmaintenance of the entire organism by causing the blood to circulate,\nwhich facilitates the circulation of oxygen and nutrients. At the\nsame time, this circulation is also responsible in part for the\npersistence of the heart itself, since the heart also benefits\ndirectly from this function (i.e., the cardiac cells receive the\noxygen and nutrients necessary for their survival). \n\nSimilar to direct natural selection accounts, organizational accounts\ncan be forward or backward-looking: the function of a trait may\nidentify its dispositional contribution to the complex organization of\nthe system which results in its own persistence or reproduction in the\nfuture (forward-looking; Schlosser 1998), or a functional attribution\nmay identify a trait\u2019s past contribution (etiological, or\nbackward-looking; McLaughlin 2001). Alvaro Moreno\u2019s group adopts\na third position. They claim their organizational account of function\nunifies these two perspectives (Mossio et al 2009; cf. Artiga &\nMartinez 2016). All these organizational accounts differ from direct\nnatural selection accounts, however, in that they make no appeal to\nthe selection history of the trait. Instead, the function of a trait\ncan be inferred from the present or past role of the trait in\nmaintaining itself within the complex, organized system without\nfurther holding that the trait was selected for that role. On this\nview, functional attributions in biology are explanatory not because\nof selection, but rather because of the causal role traits play in\ncontributing to the maintenance of the organization of a system, which\nin turn enables the traits themselves to persist. \n4.2 Direct Natural Selection Approaches\n\nAccounts of biological function which refer to natural selection\ntypically have the form that a trait's functions causally explain\nthe existence or maintenance of that trait in a given population via\nthe mechanism of natural selection. William Wimsatt (1972), Ruth\nMillikan (1984), and Karen Neander (1991a), all treat the past history\nof natural selection as the selection process that legitimizes the\nnotion of a biological function. Within such approaches there is a\ndispute about the exact role of natural selection, whether as a source\nof variation (sometimes referred to as the \u201ccreative\u201d role\nof natural selection, e.g., Neander 1988; see also Ayala 1970, 1977),\nor only as a filter on variations that arise independently (Sober\n1984). \n\nPositions which ground functional claims in natural selection have\nmuch in common with Wright\u2019s etiological account. However,\nbecause the grounding is specific to biology, they may avoid the kinds\nof counterexamples to Wright\u2019s account introduced by critics\nsuch as Christopher Boorse, predicated on the idea that Wright\u2019s\naccount is intended to provide a more general conceptual analysis. A\nrelated challenge stems from the claim that pre-Darwinian thinkers\nsuch as Harvey correctly identified functional properties of\nbiological organs, and that natural selection cannot therefore be a\nrequirement for the proper conceptual analysis of function. Defenders\nof direct natural selection accounts of function have responded in\ndifferent ways. One way, exemplified by Millikan (1989), is to argue\nthat conceptual analysis has no role to play in articulating what is\nessentially a theoretical term within modern evolutionary biology.\nAnother way, exemplified by Neander (1991b), is to say that the task\nof conceptual analysis is appropriate but restricted to the concepts\nof the relevant scientific community. \n\nPaul Davies (2001) and Arno Wouters (2005) argue that both Millikan\nand Neander are incorrect to treat malfunction as an important\ntheoretical or conceptual aspect of the practice of attributing\nfunctions by biologists. Wouters declares the wish that the study of\nbiological function should be liberated \u201cfrom the yoke of the\nphilosophy of mind\u201d (2005: 148). However, Ema Sullivan-Bissett (2017) argues\nthat while the task of explicating biological practice by philosophers\nof biology is usefully distinguished from the broader goals of\nphilosophers pursuing naturalistic accounts of mind and language (see\nthe entry on\n teleological theories of mental content),\n the latter serves legitimate goals. She regards an account of\nmalfunction to be integral to the latter project even if not to the\nformer. Davies (2001) argues that the natural selection accounts are\nunable to provide an account of malfunction insofar as they\nindividuate traits functionally, entailing that a putatively\nmalfunctioning trait is not an instance of the functionally-defined\nkind. Sullivan-Bissett addresses Davies\u2019 objection by\nincorporating a structural condition on the individuation of traits.\n(See also Garson 2016: 48\u201349, for additional discussion and\ncritique of Davies\u2019 view.) \n\nReturning to the kinds of traits studied by biologists, some theorists\nmake a distinction between the initial spread of a new phenotypic\ntrait in a population and the more recent maintenance of traits in\npopulations. Take a trait such as feathers, arising in a population by\nwhatever means. Initially this trait may have spread because of a role\nin mating displays. Later, feathers may have contributed to improved\nthermoregulation. And still later, the trait may have become more\nwidely distributed because feathers make good flight control surfaces.\nIf display or thermoregulatory functions of feathers become less\nimportant in some niches, the trait may nonetheless be maintained in a\npopulation due to selection for its flight-control function. The\nshifting functional profile may also be correlated with\ndifferentiation in form, such as between downy feathers and flight\nfeathers.\n\nSome biologists used the term pre-adaptation to capture the idea that\na trait selected for one function may turn out to be very useful for\nsomething else. However, Gould and Vrba (1982) introduced the term\n\u2018exaptation\u2019 to capture such transitions, and avoid what\nthey saw as the overly teleological implications of pre-adaptation, as\nwell as to recognize that non-selected traits of organisms could also\nbe co-opted to serve a function, increasing fitness without having any\nfurther modification by natural selection (Lloyd & Gould 2017).\nCritics of the etiological natural selection approaches sometimes\nargue that backward-looking approaches are too vague with respect to\nquestions about the point at which traits acquire or lose functions,\nand that they are consequently untestable empirically (Amundson &\nLauder 1994). Godfrey-Smith (1994) independently proposed a\n\u201cmodern history\u201d theory of functions to address these\nproblems. Similarly, Griffiths (1993: 417) invokes a notion of the\n\u201clast evolutionarily significant time period\u201d to handle\nthese issues, but many critics remain unconvinced (e.g., Wouters 1999;\nDavies 2001). \n\nAnother issue confronting direct natural selection accounts is the\nevident utility of attributing functions to novel traits of organisms\ndeveloped within a single lifetime such as the capacity of brains to\nacquire new concepts of kinds of things not previously experienced in\nthe evolutionary lineage, or of the immune system to develop\nantibodies to new infectious agents. Previously, Millikan (1984) had\nsuggested a notion of \u201cderived proper function\u201d to capture\nthis kind of example. More recently, Bouchard (2013) and Garson (2017)\nhave developed more detailed accounts of derived function,\nrespectively using \u201cdifferential persistence\u201d and\n\u201cdifferential retention\u201d within an organism\u2019s\nlifespan to play the role that differential reproduction plays in\ndirect natural selection accounts. \n\nSome biologists and philosophers of biology have been motivated by\nproblems with the backward-looking etiological approach, or by seeing\nexamples from biology that seek to identify the present functions of a\ntrait. To deal with these issues they propose a dispositional or\nforward-looking approach that analyzes function in terms of those\neffects it is disposed to produce that tend to contribute to the\npresent or future maintenance of the trait in a population of\norganisms. Various ways of spelling this out include Hinde\u2019s\n(1975) account of strong function, Boorse\u2019s (1976, 2002)\nbiostatistical theory, Bigelow and Pargetter\u2019s (1987) propensity\ntheory, and Walsh\u2019s (1996) relational theory (see also and Walsh\n& Ariew 1996). \n5. Unification and Pluralism\n\nSome theorists have argued for the pluralistic idea that biology may\nincorporate (at least) two notions of function, one to explain the\npresence of traits and the other to explain how those traits\ncontribute to the complex capacities of organisms (Millikan 1989;\nSober 1993; Godfrey-Smith 1994). Ron Amundson and George Lauder\n(Amundson & Lauder 1994) argue that paleontology is a part of\nbiology which cannot make use of the etiological account because the\nselection regime for extinct organisms is generally inaccessible, and\nit must therefore depend on Cummins-style functional analysis of\nfossilized remains. However, defenders of pluralism may respond that\neven if it is correct to say that not all parts of biology can use\nboth notions of function, this is consistent with both accounts having\na role within biology. \n\nSome theorists have argued that these two apparently distinct notions\nof function can be unified by regarding the target of explanation as\nthe biological fitness of a whole organism (e.g., Griffiths 1993;\nKitcher 1994; and perhaps Tinbergen 1963 according to Peter\nGodfrey-Smith 1994). Moreno and colleagues (Mossio et al. 2009; Moreno\n& Mossio 2015) have also claimed that their organizational\napproach unifies across backward-looking and forward-looking accounts\nby describing activities that atemporally account for the continuing\npersistence of traits. The viability of this account as one that is\ndistinct from etiological accounts has been challenged by Marc Artiga\nand Manolo Mart\u00ednez (Artiga & Mart\u00ednez 2016), who\nargue that the necessarily multi-generational characterization of\norganizational closure needed to accommodate biological functions for\nparental endowments to offspring (whether transmitted via gametes or\nbehavior) entails the standard etiological structure found in\nWright\u2019s account. \n\nAttention to the actual explanatory practices of contemporary\nbiologists is central to these discussions. This focus on scientific\npractice reflects broader trends within the philosophy of science,\nexpanding beyond the general and abstract questions about scientific\nepistemology and metaphysics that dominated the twentieth century. The\ndiversity of life itself is reflected in the variety of scientific\nattempts to understand it, and as philosophers of biology pursue\nfurther engagement with this variety, novel perspectives on the role\nand appropriateness of functional and teleological notions seem likely\nto result. \n",
