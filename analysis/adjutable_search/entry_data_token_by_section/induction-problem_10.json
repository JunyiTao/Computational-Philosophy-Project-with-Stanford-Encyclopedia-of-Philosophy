    "main_text": "Tackling the Second Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma || No Rules\n4.2 No Rules\n\nIt is possible to go even further in an attempt to dismantle the\nHumean circularity. Maybe inductive inferences do not even have a rule\nin common. What if every inductive inference is essentially unique?\nThis can be seen as rejecting Hume\u2019s premise\n P5.\n Okasha, for example, argues that Hume\u2019s circularity problem can\nbe evaded if there are \u201cno rules\u201d behind induction (Okasha\n2005a,b). Norton puts forward the similar idea that all inductive\ninferences are material, and have nothing formal in common (Norton\n2003, 2010, 2021).\n\nProponents of such views have attacked Hume\u2019s claim that there\nis a UP on which all inductive inferences are based. There have long\nbeen complaints about the vagueness of the Uniformity Principle\n(Salmon 1953). The future only resembles the past in some respects,\nbut not others. Suppose that on all my birthdays so far, I have been\nunder 40 years old. This does not give me a reason to expect that I\nwill be under 40 years old on my next birthday. There seems then to be\na major lacuna in Hume\u2019s account. He might have explained or\ndescribed how we draw an inductive inference, on the assumption that\nit is one we can draw. But he leaves untouched the question\nof how we distinguish between cases where we extrapolate a regularity\nlegitimately, regarding it as a law, and cases where we do not.\n\nNelson Goodman is often seen as having made this point in a\nparticularly vivid form with his \u201cnew riddle of induction\u201d\n(Goodman 1955: 59\u201383). Suppose we define a predicate\n\u201cgrue\u201d in the following way. An object is\n\u201cgrue\u201d when it is green if observed before time t\nand blue otherwise. Goodman considers a thought experiment in which we\nobserve a bunch of green emeralds before time t. We could\ndescribe our results by saying all the observed emeralds are green.\nUsing a simple enumerative inductive schema, we could infer from the\nresult that all observed emeralds are green, that all emeralds are\ngreen. But equally, we could describe the same results by saying that\nall observed emeralds are grue. Then using the same schema, we could\ninfer from the result that all observed emeralds are grue, that all\nemeralds are grue. In the first case, we expect an emerald observed\nafter time t to be green, whereas in the second, we expect it\nto be blue. Thus the two predictions are incompatible. Goodman claims\nthat what Hume omitted to do was to give any explanation for why we\nproject predicates like \u201cgreen\u201d, but not predicates like\n\u201cgrue\u201d. This is the \u201cnew riddle\u201d, which is\noften taken to be a further problem of induction that Hume did not\naddress.\n\nOne moral that could be taken from Goodman is that there is not one\ngeneral Uniformity Principle that all probable arguments rely upon\n(Sober 1988; Norton 2003; Okasha 2001, 2005a,b, Jackson 2019). Rather\neach inductive inference presupposes some more specific empirical\npresupposition. A particular inductive inference depends on some\nspecific way in which the future resembles the past. It can then be\njustified by another inductive inference which depends on some quite\ndifferent empirical claim. This will in turn need to be\njustified\u2014by yet another inductive inference. The nature of\nHume\u2019s problem in the second horn is thus transformed. There is\nno circularity. Rather there is a regress of inductive justifications,\neach relying on their own empirical presuppositions (Sober 1988;\nNorton 2003; Okasha 2001, 2005a,b).\n\nOne way to put this point is to say that Hume\u2019s argument rests\non a quantifier shift fallacy (Sober 1988; Okasha 2005a). Hume says\nthat there exists a general presupposition for all inductive\ninferences, whereas he should have said that for each inductive\ninference, there is some presupposition. Different inductive\ninferences then rest on different empirical presuppositions, and the\nproblem of circularity is evaded.\n\nWhat will then be the consequence of supposing that Hume\u2019s\nproblem should indeed have been a regress, rather than a circularity?\nHere different opinions are possible. On the one hand, one might think\nthat a regress still leads to a skeptical conclusion (Schurz and Thorn\n2020). So although the exact form in which Hume stated his problem was\nnot correct, the conclusion is not substantially different (Sober\n1988). Another possibility is that the transformation mitigates or\neven removes the skeptical problem. For example, Norton argues that\nthe upshot is a dissolution of the problem of induction, since the\nregress of justifications benignly terminates (Norton 2003). And\nOkasha more mildly suggests that even if the regress is infinite,\n\u201cPerhaps infinite regresses are less bad than vicious circles\nafter all\u201d (Okasha 2005b: 253).\n\nAny dissolution of Hume\u2019s circularity does not depend only on\narguing that the UP should be replaced by empirical presuppositions\nwhich are specific to each inductive inference. It is also necessary\nto establish that inductive inferences share no common\nrules\u2014otherwise there will still be at least some\nrule-circularity. Okasha suggests that the Bayesian model of\nbelief-updating is an illustration how induction can be characterized\nin a rule-free way, but this is problematic, since in this model all\ninductive inferences still share the common rule of Bayesian\nconditionalisation. Norton\u2019s material theory of induction\npostulates a rule-free characterization of induction, but it is not\nclear whether it really can avoid any role for general rules\n(Achinstein 2010, Kelly 2010, Worrall 2010).\n",
