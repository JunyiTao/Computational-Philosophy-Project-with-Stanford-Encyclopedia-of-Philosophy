    "main_text": "Causation and Radiation\n6. Causation and Radiation\n\nElectromagnetic radiation phenomena exhibit a temporal asymmetry: we\nobserve radiation coherently diverging from a radiating source, such\nthe light emitted by a star, but we do not observe radiation\ncoherently converging into a source, unless we delicately set up such\na system. What can explain this asymmetry? And how is the asymmetry\nrelated to the causal asymmetry, on the one hand, and the\nthermodynamic asymmetry, on the other? Debates on these questions have\na long history. On one side we find both physicists and philosophers\nwho maintain\u2014in the case of physicists sometimes more, sometimes\nless explicitly\u2014that the \u201carrow of radiation\u201d is a\nmanifestation of a causal asymmetry (Ritz 1908; Einstein 1909a;\nJackson 1999; Griffiths 2017; Rohrlich 2006; Frisch 2005; 2006;\n2014). On the other side, there are physicists and philosophers who\nmaintain that the arrow of radiation has the same root as the\nthermodynamic arrow, an asymmetry between prevailing initial and final\nconditions (Einstein 1909b; Wheeler & Feynman 1945; Price 1997;\n2006; North 2003; Zeh 2007; Earman \n2011).[5]\n\nThis debate is far from settled. The laws of classical\nelectrodynamics, the Maxwell-Lorentz equations, imply a wave equation,\nwhich is a time-reversal invariant hyperbolic equation of motion and\nis standardly solved using the Green\u2019s functions formalism.\nThus, the disagreement is partly a disagreement over the question\nwhether the radiation field\u2019s causal or retarded Green\u2019s\nfunction captures important features of how charged particles and\nelectromagnetic fields interact that are not properly captured by the\n\u201canti-causal\u201d or advanced Green\u2019s functions.\n\nSome authors argue that the asymmetry of radiation is, like the\nthermodynamic asymmetry purely a macroscopic phenomenon (Price 1997;\nField 2003). But this claim is not borne out by how physicists treat\ninteractions between charges and fields. To the extent that\nmicroscopic charged particles can be (and in fact are) modeled\nclassically, their interactions with fields are modeled as exhibiting\ntemporal asymmetries just as macroscopic field sources do (Jackson\n1999). These asymmetries include the fact that accelerating\nmicroscopic charged particles are damped (since they radiate off part\nof the energy they receive), rather than being anti-damped (extracting\nadditional energy from the surrounding field) (Rohrlich 2007). Thus, whatever the correct account of the\nasymmetry of radiation is, it has to apply to microscopic charged\nparticles as well as to macroscopic collections of charges.\n\nAuthors who try to derive the radiation arrow from probabilistic\nconsiderations sometimes argue that coherently converging waves do not\noccur because such waves would require a radically improbable\ncoordinated behavior of incoming waves (Earman 2011; see also Atkinson\n2006). But this line of argument is in danger of committing what Price\nhas called \u201cthe temporal double-standard fallacy\u201d (Price\n1997). From an acausal perspective the coordinated behavior of\noutgoing waves in the future of a radiating source should appear to be\nno less improbable than coordinated behavior of incoming waves in the\npast of the source. Thus, probabilistic accounts that deny a\nfundamental causal asymmetry need to be careful to avoid probabilistic\narguments for the asymmetry ultimately driven by causal intuitions and\npresumably have to be content with positing the initial randomness\nassumption as a fundamental de facto asymmetry that cannot be\nfurther justified.\n\nIt is important here, too, to be clear on what is at stake in the\ndebate. Within the metaphysical project, the debate concerns the\nquestion what the fundamental grounds for the asymmetry of radiation\nphenomena are: is the asymmetry an expression of a fundamental causal\nasymmetry or is it due to an asymmetry between prevailing initial and\nfinal conditions?\n\nFrom the perspective of a purely functional project, by contrast,\nthere is less disagreement between these two views than it may\ninitially seem. From a functionalist perspective, defenders of a\ncausal picture and defenders of a probabilistic account can be\nunderstood as emphasizing two different aspects that both are integral\nfeatures of causal models: an initial independence assumption and\ndirected causal relationships among variables. Thus, certain\ncriticisms of causal accounts of the asymmetry of radiation, such as\nEarman (2011), are most charitably understood as attacking a\nmetaphysical account of the role of causation in accounting for\nradiation phenomena. Earman\u2019s criticism cannot undermine a\nfunctional account of causation in physics, since it invokes the very\nsame probabilistic considerations that, on a functional account,\nunderwrite representing radiation phenomena in terms of causal\nmodels.\n",
