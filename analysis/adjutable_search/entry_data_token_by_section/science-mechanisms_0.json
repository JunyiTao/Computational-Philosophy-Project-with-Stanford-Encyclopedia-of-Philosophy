    "main_text": "The Rise of the New Mechanism\n1. The Rise of the New Mechanism\nTwentieth century philosophy of science was largely dominated by\nlogical empiricism. More a framework for doing philosophy of science\nthan any coherent set of doctrines, logical empiricism addressed a\nrange of issues in philosophy of science through the lens of the\nlogical and mathematical structures constitutive of scientific thought\nand practice (see the entry on \n logical empiricism). Logical\n empiricism tended, by and large, to\nfocus on abstract, epistemic features of science, with little\nattention to scientific practice. Physics was the dominant\nexemplar.\nThe new mechanical philosophy emerged around the turn of the\ntwenty-first century as a new framework for thinking about the\nphilosophy of science. The philosophers who developed this framework\nwere, by comparison with the logical empiricists, practitioners as\nwell of the history of science and tended, by and large, to focus on\nthe biological, rather than physical, sciences. Many new mechanists\ndeveloped their framework explicitly as a successor to logical\nempiricist treatments of causation, levels, explanation, laws of\nnature, reduction, and discovery. \nAs with logical empiricism, the new mechanical philosophy is less a\nsystematic and coherent set of doctrines than it is an orientation to\nthe subject matter of the philosophy of science. The approach emerged\nas philosophers and historians of science began to break from the\nonce-standard practice of reconstructing scientific inference with the\ntools of logic and, instead, to embrace detailed investigation of\nactual episodes from the history of science. The main tenets of\nlogical empiricism had been under intense criticism for decades, and a\nnew era of historically informed philosophy of science had taken hold\nthrough the works of, e.g., Kuhn (1962), Laudan (1977), and Lakatos\n(1977). To many such scholars raised in this post-logical empiricist\nmilieu, it appeared that much of the practice of contemporary science\n(both in the laboratory and in print) was driven by the search for\nmechanisms, that many of the grand achievements in the history of\nscience were discoveries of mechanisms, and that more traditional\nphilosophy of science, for whatever reason, had failed to appreciate\nthis central feature of the scientific worldview.\nAspects of the new mechanical philosophy began to emerge in the\nlate 1960s. Fodor (1968), for example, contrasted mechanistic\nexplanations (dealing with parts and their law-like interactions) with\nfunctional explanations in psychology. Wimsatt (1972a, 1976), building\non the work of Simon (1962) and Kaufman (1971), argued repeatedly that\nthe abstract and idealized structures of logical empiricism were\nill-suited to understanding how scientists discover and explain\ncomplex systems at multiple levels of organization. Cummins (1975)\nprovided an account of functional analyses, characterizing a function\nas a contribution a component part makes to the overall capacity\nof some system that includes that component. Salmon (1984, 1989)\nargued that empiricist views of scientific explanation are\nfundamentally flawed because they neglect causal\nmechanisms. Cartwright (1989) argued that the logical empiricist\nconception of a law of nature is, in fact, a philosophical fiction\nused to describe the search for capacities and nomological\nmachines.\nThese strands began to coalesce into an over-arching perspective in\nthe 1990s. The earliest clear statement of the new mechanism was\nBechtel and Richardson\u2019s (2010 [1993]) Discovering\nComplexity. They self-consciously put aside logical empiricist\nconcerns with theory reduction and focused instead on the process by\nwhich scientists discover mechanisms\n(see Section 6 below). Soon after,\nGlennan argued that mechanisms are the secret connexion Hume sought\nbetween cause and effect (1996), a thesis related to and partly\ninspired by Cartwright\u2019s focus on capacities and nomological machines\n(Glennan 1997). Likewise, Thagard\u2019s How Scientists Explain\nDisease centered the search for causes and mechanisms in medicine\n(Thagard 2000; see also Section 6\nbelow). Machamer, Darden and Craver\u2019s \u201cThinking about\nMechanisms\u201d (Machamer, Darden, and Craver 2000; familiarly known\nas \u201cMDC\u201d) drew these strands together and became for many\nthe lightening rod of the new mechanist perspective. MDC suggested\nthat the philosophy of biology, and perhaps the philosophy of science\nmore generally, should be restructured around the fundamental idea\nthat many scientists organize their work around the search for\nmechanisms.\n",
