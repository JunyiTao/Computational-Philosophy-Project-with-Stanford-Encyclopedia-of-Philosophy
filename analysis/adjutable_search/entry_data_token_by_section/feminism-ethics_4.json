Themes in feminist ethics\n\nIn the fifty years that feminist ethics has been a subject of\nphilosophical scholarship in (initially) Western and (increasingly)\ninternational discourse, theorists have considered metaethical,\ntheoretical, and practical questions. Questions that occupied scholars\nin preceding centuries, especially those regarding moral agents\u2019\nnatural (and gendered) capacities for moral deliberation, are\ncritically reconsidered in debates that arose in the 1970s and 1980s.\nOne main area of inquiry addresses whether and why there may be\nmeaningful differences in feminine and masculine priorities of care\nand justice in normative theory. Concern about feminist methods of\narticulating ethical theories arise during this time and continue.\nThese debates can be found in the scholarship of intersectionality,\nBlack feminist thought and women of color feminism, transnational\nfeminism, queer theory, disability studies, and twenty-first century\ncriticisms of feminist ethics. They are of special concern whenever\nfeminist ethicists seem to uphold a gender binary and simplistic\nconceptualizations of woman as a category. Questions about\nthe shortcomings of traditional ethical theories, about which virtues\nconstitute morally good character in contexts of oppression, and about\nwhich kinds of ethical theories will ameliorate gendered oppressions\nand evils generate critical scholarship in every decade.\n",
