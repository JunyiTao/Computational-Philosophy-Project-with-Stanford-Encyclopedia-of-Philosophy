    "main_text": "Ontological Issues || Ontological category of quantum states\n5.2 Ontological category of quantum states\n\nThe major realist approaches to the measurement problem are all, in\nsome sense, realist about quantum states. Merely saying this is\ninsufficient to give an account of the ontology of a given\ninterpretation. Among the questions to be addressed are: if quantum\nstates represent something physically real, what sort of thing is it?\nThis is the question of the ontological construal of quantum states.\nAnother question is the EPR question, whether a description in terms\nof quantum states can be taken as, in principle, complete, or whether\nit must be supplemented by different ontology.\n\nDe Broglie\u2019s original conception of the \u201cpilot wave\u201d\nwas that it would be a field, analogous to an electromagnetic field.\nThe original conception was that each particle would have its own\nguiding wave. However, in quantum mechanics as it was developed at the\nhands of Schr\u00f6dinger, for a system of two or more particles there\nare not individual wave functions for each particle, but, rather, a\nsingle wave function that is defined on \\(n\\)-tuples of\npoints in space, where \\(n\\) is the number of\nparticles. This was taken, by de Broglie, Schr\u00f6dinger and others,\nto militate against the conception of quantum wave functions as\nfields. If quantum states represent something in physical reality,\nthey are unlike anything familiar in classical physics.\n\nOne response that has been taken is to insist that quantum wave\nfunctions are fields nonetheless, albeit fields on a space of\nenormously high dimension, namely, \\(3n\\), where \\(n\\)\nis the number of elementary particles in the universe. On this view,\nthis high-dimensional space is thought of as more fundamental than the\nfamiliar three-dimensional space (or four-dimensional spacetime) that\nis usually taken to be the arena of physical events. See Albert (1996,\n2013), for the classic statement of the view; other proponents include\nLoewer (1996), Lewis (2004), Ney (2012, 2013a,b, 2021), and North\n(2013). Most of the discussion of this proposal has taken place within\nthe context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which is not a\nfundamental theory. It has been argued that considerations of how the\nwave functions of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics arise from a\nquantum field theory undermines the idea that wave functions are\nrelevantly like fields on configuration space, and also the idea that\nconfiguration spaces can be thought of as more fundamental than\nordinary spacetime (Myrvold 2015).\n\nA view that takes a wave function as a field on a high-dimensional\nspace must be distinguished from a view that takes it to be what Belot\n(2012) has called a multi-field, which assigns properties to\n\\(n\\)-tuples of points of ordinary three-dimensional\nspace. These are distinct views; proponents of the \\(3n\\)-dimensional\nconception make much of the fact that it restores Separability: on\nthis view, a complete specification of the way the world is, at some\ntime, is given by specification of local states of affairs at each\naddress in the fundamental (\\(3n\\)-dimensional) space. Taking a wave\nfunction to be a multi-field, on the other hand, involves accepting\nnonseparability. Another difference between taking wave-functions as\nmulti-fields on ordinary space and taking them to be fields on a\nhigh-dimensional space is that, on the multi-field view, there is no\nquestion about the relation of ordinary three-dimensional space to\nsome more fundamental space.\u00ad Hubert and Romano (2018) argue that\nwave-functions are naturally and straightforwardly construed as\nmulti-fields.\n\nIt has been argued that, on the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory and\nrelated pilot wave theories, the quantum state plays a role more\nsimilar to that of a law in classical mechanics; its role is to\nprovide dynamics for the Bohmian corpuscles, which, according to the\ntheory, compose ordinary objects. See D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and\nZangh\u00ec (1997),  Allori et al. (2008), Allori\n(2021).\n\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and Zangh\u00ec (1992) introduced the term\n\u201cprimitive ontology\u201d for what, according to a physical\ntheory, makes up ordinary physical objects; on the de Broglie-Bohm\ntheory, this is the Bohmian corpuscles. The conception is extended to\ninterpretations of collapse theories by Allori et al. (2008).\nPrimitive ontology is to be distinguished from other ontology, such as\nthe quantum state, that is introduced into the theory to account for\nthe behavior of the primitive ontology. The distinction is meant to be\na guide as to how to conceive of the nonprimitive ontology of the\ntheory.\n",
