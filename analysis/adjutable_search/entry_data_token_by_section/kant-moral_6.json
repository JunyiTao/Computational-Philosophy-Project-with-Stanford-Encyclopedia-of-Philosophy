    "main_text": "The Autonomy Formula\n7. The Autonomy Formula\n\nThe third formulation of the CI is \u201cthe Idea of the will of\nevery rational being as a will that legislates universal\nlaw.\u201d (G 4:432). Although Kant does not state this as an\nimperative, as he does in the other formulations, it is easy enough to\nput it in that form: Act so that through your maxims you could be a\nlegislator of universal laws. This sounds very similar to the first\nformulation. However, in this case we focus on our status as universal\nlaw givers rather than universal law followers. This\nis of course the source of the very dignity of humanity Kant speaks of\nin the second formulation. A rational will that is merely bound by\nuniversal laws could act accordingly from natural and non-moral\nmotives, such as self-interest. But in order to be a legislator of\nuniversal laws, such contingent motives, motives that rational agents\nsuch as ourselves may or may not have, must be set aside. Hence, we\nare required, according to this formulation, to conform our behavior\nto principles that express this autonomy of the rational will \u2014\nits status as a source of the very universal laws that obligate it. As\nwith the Humanity Formula, this new formulation of the CI does not\nchange the outcome, since each is supposed to formulate the very same\nmoral law, and in some sense \u201cunite\u201d the other\nformulations within it. Kant takes each formulation that succeeds the\nfirst in its own way as bringing the moral law \u201ccloser to\nfeeling\u201d. The Autonomy Formula presumably does this by putting\non display the source of our dignity and worth, our status as free\nrational agents who are the source of the authority behind the very\nmoral laws that bind us.\n",
