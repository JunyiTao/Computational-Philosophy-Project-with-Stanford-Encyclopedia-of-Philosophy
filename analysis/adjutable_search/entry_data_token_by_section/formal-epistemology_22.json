    "main_text": "Applications Outside Epistemology || The Existence of God: Fine-tuning\n6.3 The Meaning of \u2018If\u2026Then\u2026\u2019\n\nHypothetical discourses have a puzzling connection to reality. Suppose\nI assert, \u201cIf the GDP continues to decline, unemployment will\nrise\u201d, but the GDP does not continue to decline, instead holding\nsteady. Is what I said true or false? It\u2019s not obvious, since my\nstatement has not been tested by the world in the obvious way. If the\nGDP had continued to decline yet unemployment had fallen, my statement\nwould have been tested, and it would have failed. But GDP held steady,\nso what test can my assertion be put to?\n\nWhen working with propositional logic, we often translate ordinary\n\u2018If \u2026then \u2026\u2019 statements using the material\nconditional, \\(\\supset\\). But the probability of a\n\\(\\supset\\)-statement often exceeds that of the corresponding\n\u2018If \u2026then \u2026\u2019 statement. For example,\nit\u2019s very improbable that I\u2019ll win an Olympic gold medal\nin diving (\\(G\\)) if I train five hours a day (\\(T\\)). Olympic divers\nretire by the time they\u2019re my age. Yet \\(p(T \\supset G)\\) is\nquite high, for the simple reason that \\(T \\supset G\\) is equivalent\nto \\(\\neg T \\vee G\\) and \\(\\neg T\\) is very probable. I won\u2019t be\ntraining for Olympic diving one minute a day, much less five hours. I\ndon\u2019t even swim. So it\u2019s hard to accept \\(\\supset\\) as a\ngood model of \u2018If \u2026then \u2026\u2019, though some\nphilosophers do nevertheless think it\u2019s correct (Grice 1989;\nJackson 1987).\n\nCould we introduce a new connective with a different semantics than\n\\(\\supset\\) that would do better? A striking theorem discovered by\nLewis (1976) suggests not. The theorem relies on an assumption posited\nby Stalnaker (1970): that the probability of \u201cIf \\(A\\) then\n\\(B\\)\u201d is the same as the conditional probability, \\(p(B\\mid\nA)\\). Let\u2019s use \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) as shorthand for the\nEnglish, \u201cIf \\(A\\) then \\(B\\)\u201d:\n\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis\n\n\\(p(A \\rightarrow B) = p(B\\mid A)\\), for any propositions \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) and probability function \\(p\\) such that \\(p(A) \\neq 0.\\)\n\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis might seem obvious at first, even\ntautological. Isn\u2019t \\(p(B\\mid A)\\) just the probability of the\nproposition \\(B\\mid A\\), which is just shorthand for \u201c\\(B\\) is\ntrue if \\(A\\) is\u201d? This is a common misconception for newcomers\nto probability theory, one that Lewis shows leads to disastrous\nresults. If we think of \\(B\\mid A\\) as a complex proposition built out\nof the sentences \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) with a connective \\(\\mid \\),\nprobability theory goes to pot (see the\n technical supplement\n for a proof):\n\nTheorem (Lewis\u2019 Triviality Theorem). If\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis is true, then \\(p(B\\mid A)=p(B)\\) for all\npropositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(p(A) \\neq 0\\) and \\(1 >\np(B) > 0\\).\n\nApparently, no propositional connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) can obey\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis. If one did, every proposition would be\nindependent of every other (except where things are absolutely\ncertain). But surely some facts are relevant to some others.\n\nOne thing this tells us is that the right way to read \\(p(B\\mid A)\\)\nis not as the probability of some sentence, \\(B\\mid A\\), but instead\nas a two-place function. The syntax \\(p(B\\mid A)\\) is misleading, and\nmight be more clearly written \\(p(B,A)\\), the standard notation for a\ntwo-place function like \\(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2\\).\n\nBut a more troubling lesson is that we face an uncomfortable choice:\neither there is no such thing as the proposition \\(A \\rightarrow B\\),\nor the probability of the proposition \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\ndoesn\u2019t always match \\(p(B\\mid A)\\). The first option would seem\nto make assertions of the form \u201cIf \u2026then \u2026\u201d\na peculiar exception to the compositionality of natural language\nsemantics (but see Edgington 2000). The second option is\ncounterintuitive, and also apparently counter to empirical evidence\nthat people ordinarily do take \\(p(A \\rightarrow B)\\) to be the same\nas \\(p(B\\mid A)\\) (Douven and Dietz 2011).\n\nA particularly striking thing about this problem is how robust it is.\nNot only have many related theorems been proved using probability\ntheory (H\u00e1jek 1989; Edgington 1995; Bradley 2000), but similar\nresults have also emerged in a completely independent formal\nframework:\n the theory of belief revision.\n\nBelief revision theory represents beliefs with sentences of\npropositional logic: \\(A\\), \\(A \\supset B\\), \\(\\neg (A \\wedge \\neg\nB)\\), and so on. Your full corpus of beliefs is a set of such\nsentences we call \\(K\\) (not to be confused with the sentential\noperator \\(K\\) from epistemic logic\n (\u00a74.1)).\n Importantly, we assume that \\(K\\) contains everything entailed by\nyour beliefs: if \\(A\\) and \\(A \\supset B\\) are in \\(K\\), then so is\n\\(B\\), for example.\n\nOf course, real people don\u2019t believe everything their beliefs\nentail, but it helps keep things simple to make this assumption. You\ncan think of it as an idealization: we\u2019re theorizing about what\nyour beliefs should look like if you were a perfect logician. (Notice\nthat probability theory has a similar feature encoded in axiom (2),\nand epistemic logic\u2019s K axiom and\nNEC rule together have a similar effect.)\n\nThe main aim of belief revision theory is to say how you should revise\nyour beliefs when you learn new information. Suppose you learn about\nthe existence of a new planet, Algernon. How should \\(K\\) change when\nyou learn this new fact, \\(A\\)? As long as \\(A\\) doesn\u2019t\ncontradict your existing beliefs, the standard view is that you should\njust add \\(A\\) to \\(K\\), along with everything that follows logically\nfrom the members of \\(K\\) and \\(A\\) together. We call the new set of\nbeliefs \\(K + A\\): add \\(A\\) to \\(K\\) along with all that follows\nlogically (Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson 1985).\n\nWhat if \\(A\\) does contradict your existing beliefs? Then \\(K + A\\)\nwouldn\u2019t do, since it would be inconsistent. We\u2019d have to\nremove some of your existing beliefs to make room for \\(A\\). Luckily,\nfor our purposes here we don\u2019t have to worry about how this\nworks. We\u2019ll only consider cases where \\(A\\) is consistent with\n\\(K\\), in which case \\(K + A\\) will do.\n\nNow, suppose we want to add a new connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) to our\nlanguage to represent \u2018If \u2026then \u2026\u2019. When\nshould you believe a sentence of the form \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)? The\nclassic answer comes from an idea of Ramsey\u2019s: that we decide\nwhether to accept \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) by temporarily adding \\(A\\) to\nour stock of beliefs and then seeing whether \\(B\\) follows (Ramsey\n1990 [1929]). This idea yields a principle called the Ramsey\nTest:\n\nRamsey Test\n\n\\(K\\) contains \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) if \\(K + A\\) contains \\(B\\); and\n\\(K\\) contains \\(\\neg (A \\rightarrow B)\\) if \\(K + A\\) contains \\(\\neg\nB\\).\n\nIn other words, you accept \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) if adding \\(A\\) to your\nstock of beliefs brings \\(B\\) with it. If instead adding \\(A\\) brings\n\\(\\neg B\\) with it, you reject this conditional (Etlin 2009).\n\nPlausible as the Ramsey Test is, G\u00e4rdenfors (1986) shows that it\ncannot hold unless your beliefs are absurdly opinionated. We\u2019ll\nstate this result somewhat informally (see the\n technical supplement\n for a somewhat informal proof):\n\nTheorem (G\u00e4rdenfors\u2019 Triviality Theorem).\nAs long as there are two propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\(K\\)\nis agnostic about \\(A\\), \\(A \\supset B\\), and \\(A \\supset \\neg B\\),\nthe Ramsey Test cannot hold.\n\nApparently, much as no propositional connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) can\nobey Stalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis in probability theory, none can obey\nThe Ramsey Test in belief revision theory either. Whether we approach\nepistemology using probabilities or flat-out beliefs, the same problem\narises. Should we conclude that conditionals have no factual content?\nIt\u2019s a hotly contested question, on which\n the entry on conditionals\n has more.\n",
