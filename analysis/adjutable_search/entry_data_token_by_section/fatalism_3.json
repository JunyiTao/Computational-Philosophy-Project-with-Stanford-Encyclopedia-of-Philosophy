We can say that it depends on the state of the world\nat the time of the event spoken of; or, more generally, that it\ndepends on the state of the world at the times spoken of, if any\n(Westphal 2006). The solution we prefer is, however, likely to be\nrelated to the view we take about the nature of time.\n",
