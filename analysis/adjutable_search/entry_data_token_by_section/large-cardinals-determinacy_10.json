Determinacy and Large Cardinals\n\nThe above limitative results show that ZFC lacks sufficient power\nto resolve many questions about simple definable sets of\nreals\u2014it cannot determine\nwhether \u03a3\u033012\nsets have the regularity properties and it cannot determine the\npattern of the uniformization property\nbeyond \u03a3\u033012. This\nplaced mathematicians in an interesting predicament. In order to\nresolve these questions they must expand their resources beyond\nZFC. But there are many ways of doing this and it is unclear at the\noutset whether there is a correct direction of expansion. \n\n There were two main candidates for new axioms that underwent\nintensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s: Axioms of definable\ndeterminacy and large cardinal axioms. In this section we will (1)\nintroduce the basic machinery of determinacy and describe the\nimplications of axioms of definable determinacy for classical\ndescriptive set theory and (2) describe the implications of large\ncardinal axioms for classical descriptive set theory and briefly touch\non the connection between the two approaches. \n",
