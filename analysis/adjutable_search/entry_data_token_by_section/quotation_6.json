    "main_text": "Basic Quotational Features || The Use-Mention Distinction\n2.2 The Use-Mention Distinction\n\nIt is standard practice in philosophy to distinguish the use\nof an expression from the mentioning of it. Confusing these\ntwo is often taken to be a philosophical mortal sin. Despite its\nubiquitous appeal, it is controversial exactly how to draw the\ndistinction. The initial thought is easy enough. Consider (D1) and\n(D2):\n\nD1. Jim went to Paris\n\nD2. \u2018Jim\u2019 has three letters\n\nIn (D1) the word \u2018Jim\u2019 is used to talk about (or signify,\nor denote) a person, i.e. Jim, and the sentence says about that person\nthat he went to Paris. In (D2) the word is not used in that way.\nInstead, \u2018Jim\u2019 is used to talk about (or signify or\ndenote) a word, i.e. \u2018Jim\u2019, and the sentence says about\nthat word that it has three\n letters[5].\n In (D1), \u2018Jim\u2019 is being used and in (D2) it is\nbeing mentioned.\n\nThe initial thought seems right as far as it goes, but it might be\nthought it doesn\u2019t go far enough. One might hope that we could\nsay more to flesh it out in an uncontroversial way, a\ntheory-neutral way that any party to the debate could agree on. In\nfact, though (and this is not recognized enough), this is not\nstraightforward. To see this, consider a couple of ways to try to\nbuild on the initial characterization:\n\nExpression \\(E\\) is mentioned in sentence \\(S\\) just in\ncase \\(E\\) is quoted in \\(S\\).\n\n\nA problem with this is that according to some theories, an expression\ncan be mentioned without being quoted (see Objection 3 in section\n3.3.2).\n\nExpression \\(E\\) is mentioned in sentence \\(S\\) just in\ncase it is used to refer to itself in \\(S\\).\n\n\nThis is problematic in a couple of ways. First, notice that according\nto (ii), \\(E\\) must be used in order to mention it; that\u2019s\npotentially puzzling. More significantly, it is controversial whether\nstandard meta-linguistic devices such as quotation are referring\nexpressions. The theories presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3 treat\nquotations as descriptions. If descriptions are quantified\nexpressions, then quotations are quantifiers, and quantifiers are\ntypically not treated as referring expressions. Proposals along the\nlines of (ii) would also have to ensure that \u2018the first seven\nwords in this sentence\u2019 in (D3) don\u2019t end up referring to\n\u2018the first seven words in this sentence\u2019:\n\nD3. The first seven words in this sentence contain thirty-two\nletters.\n\nWhat this suggests is that any attempt to characterize the distinction\nbetween use and mention more sophisticated than the\ninitial characterization in this section will need to address at least\nsome of the tricky issues that face the various theories of quotation\nwe describe in what follows.\n",
