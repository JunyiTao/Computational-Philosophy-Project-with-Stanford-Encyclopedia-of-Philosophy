The genesis of the concept\n\nThe concept of N\u00e9gritude emerged as the expression of a revolt\nagainst the historical situation of French colonialism and racism. The\nparticular form taken by that revolt was the product of the encounter,\nin Paris, in the late 1920s, of three black students coming from\ndifferent French colonies: Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\n(1913\u20132008) from Martinique, L\u00e9on Gontran Damas\n(1912\u20131978) from Guiana and L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor\n(1906\u20132001) from Senegal. Being colonial subjects meant that\nthey all belonged to people considered uncivilized, naturally in need\nof education and guidance from Europe, namely France. In addition, the\nmemory of slavery was very vivid in Guiana and Martinique. Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire and L\u00e9on Damas were already friends before they\ncame to Paris in 1931. They were classmates in Fort-de-France,\nMartinique, where they both graduated from Victor Schoelcher High\nSchool. Damas came to Paris to study Law while C\u00e9saire had been\naccepted at Lyc\u00e9e Louis Le Grand to study for the highly\nselective test for admission to the prestigious \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure on rue d\u2019Ulm. Upon his arrival at the\nLyc\u00e9e on the first day of classes he met Senghor who had\nalready been a student at Louis le Grand for three years.\n\nC\u00e9saire has described his first encounter with Senghor as\nfriendship at first sight which would last for the rest of their\nfairly long lives. He has also added that their personal friendship\nmeant the encounter between Africa and the African\n Diaspora.[1]\n C\u00e9saire, Damas and Senghor had individual lived experiences of\ntheir feeling of revolt against a world of racism and colonial\ndomination. In the case of C\u00e9saire that feeling was expressed\nin his detestation of Martinique which, as he confessed in an\ninterview with French author Fran\u00e7oise Verg\u00e8s, he was\nhappy to leave after high school: he hated the \u201ccolored\npetit-bourgeois\u201d of the island because of their\n\u201cfundamental tendency to ape Europe\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2005,\n19). As for Senghor, he has written that in his revolt against his\nteachers at College Libermann high school in Dakar, he had discovered\n\u201cn\u00e9gritude\u201d before having the concept: he refused\nto accept their claim that through their education they were building\nChristianity and civilization in his soul where there was nothing but\npaganism and barbarism before. Now their encounter as people of\nAfrican descent regardless of where they were from would lead to the\ntransformation of their individual feelings of revolt into a concept\nthat would also unify all Black people and overcome the separation\ncreated by slavery but also by the prejudices born out of the\ndifferent paths taken. C\u00e9saire has often evoked the\nembarrassment felt by people from the Caribbean at the idea of being\nassociated with Africans as they shared Europe\u2019s ideas that they\nwere now living in the lands of the civilized. He quotes as an example\na \u201csnobbish\u201d young Antillean who came to him protesting\nthat he talked too much about Africa, claiming that they had nothing\nin common with that continent and its peoples: \u201cthey are\nsavages, we are different\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2005, 28).\n\nBeyond the encounter between Africa and the French Caribbean\nC\u00e9saire, Senghor and Damas also discovered together the\nAmerican movement of Harlem Renaissance. At the \u201csalon\u201d,\nin Paris, hosted by sisters from Martinique, Jane, Paulette and\nAndr\u00e9e Nardal, they met many Black American writers, such as\nLangston Hughes or Claude McKay. With the writers of the Harlem\nRenaissance movement they found an expression of black pride, a\nconsciousness of a culture, an affirmation of a distinct identity that\nwas in sharp contrast to French assimilationism. In a word they were\nready to proclaim the n\u00e9gritude of the \u201cnew Negro\u201d\nto quote the title of the anthology of Harlem writers by Alain Locke\nwhich very much impressed Senghor and his friends (Vaillant 1990,\n93\u201394).\n\nAn important precision needs to be made here about the space created\nby the Nardal sisters for Negritude. Thus, T. Deanan Sharpley-Whiting\ncalls attention to the fact that a \u201cmasculinist genealogy\nconstructed by the poets and shored up by literary historians,\ncritics, and Africanist philosophers continues to elide and minimize\nthe presence and contributions of black women, namely their\nfrancophone counterparts, to the movement\u2019s evolution\u201d\n(Sharpley-Whiting, 2000, 10). And she quotes a letter from Paulette\nNardal, written in 1960, in which she \u201c\u2018bitterly\ncomplained\u2019 of the erasure of her and Jane Nardal\u2019s roles\nin the promulgation of the ideas that would later become the hallmarks\nof C\u00e9saire, Damas, and Senghor\u201d (Sharpley-Whiting, 2000,\n10). It must be recalled, in particular, concerning the\n\u201cgenealogy\u201d of the movement, that an article by Jane\nNardal, entitled \u201cInternationalisme noir\u201d, published in\n1928, predated by more than ten years the first important theoretical\narticle published by Senghor: \u201cWhat the Black Man\nContributes\u201d (published in 1939). What Jane Nardal says in her\nshort article about a \u201cNegro sprit\u201d transcending the\ndifferences inevitably created by the course of history, about the\nimportance of \u201cturning back toward Africa (\u2026) in\nremembering a common origin\u201d, or about the significance, first\nand foremost for the Africans themselves, of the discovery by\nEuropeans (first the \u201csnobs and artists\u201d among them) of\n\u201cNegro art\u201d and, more generally, \u201cthe centers of\nAfrican civilizations, their religious systems, their forms of\ngovernment, their artistic wealth\u201d (Nardal, 2002,\n105\u2013107), are all notions and themes that will be developed by\nSenghor, C\u00e9saire, and Damas.\n2. N\u00e9gritude as revolt / N\u00e9gritude as philosophy\n\nConventionally, the founding moment of the Negritude movement was the\ncreation, in 1934\u20131935, of the journal L\u2019Etudiant\nnoir (The Black Student), to take the place of another\nperiodical, L\u2019Etudiant martiniquais (The Martiniquan\nStudent), a move from the consideration of a regional origin to the\naffirmation of the call made by Jane Nardal for a \u201cblack\ninternationalism\u201d. That is when Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\ncoined for that conscience of a global blackness the concept of\n\u201cnegritude\u201d. It was meant to be aggressive, provocative,\ndisturbing, as it turned around, reclaimed, and appropriated the\nFrench word \u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d which, from its etymological\nmeaning as \u201cblack\u201d, had become a racist slur. The\nphilosophers of Negritude have often said that they too were sensitive\nto the provocative nature of the word. But they were also conscious of\nthe force of a concept constructed to be an irritant about which\nC\u00e9saire has declared at the beginning of a lecture he gave on\nFebruary 26, 1987, at the International University of Florida in\nMiami: \u201c\u2026I confess that I do not always like the word\nN\u00e9gritude even if I am the one, with the complicity of a few\nothers, who contributed to its invention and its launching\u201d\nadding that, still, \u201cit corresponds to an evident reality and,\nin any case to a need that appears to be a deep one\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire 2004, 80). \u201cWhat is that reality?\u201d\nC\u00e9saire proceeded then asking. Indeed, that is the question: is\nthere a content and a substance of the concept of N\u00e9gritude\nbeyond the revolt and the proclamation? In other words, is\nN\u00e9gritude mainly a posture of revolt against oppression the\nmanifestation of which is primarily the poetry it has produced, or\ndoes it have the substantial significance of a philosophy that gives\ndifferent expressions to an African presence, to a distinctive black\nway of being-in-the-world? The answer oscillates between the two\nterms of the alternative. Negritude as both a resounding poetic scream\nand the philosophical project to retrieve and explore an identity\nfound the most eloquent expression in an address Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire gave in Geneva on June 2nd 1978 on the\noccasion of the creation by Robert Cornman of a cantata entitled\nRetour and inspired by the Notebooks of a Return to the\nNative Land. In that address reproduced in Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire, pour regarder le si\u00e8cle en face, the poet\nfrom Martinique declares:\n\n\u2026 when it appeared the literature of N\u00e9gritude created a\nrevolution: in the darkness of the great silence, a voice was raising\nup, with no interpreter, no alteration, and no complacency, a violent\nand staccato voice, and it said for the first time: \u201cI,\nN\u00e8gre.\u201d\n\nA voice of revolt\n\nA voice of resentment\n\nNo doubt\n\nBut also of fidelity, a voice of freedom, and first and foremost, a\nvoice for the retrieved identity. (Th\u00e9bia-Melsan 2000, 28)\n\n\nIn fact both answers have been given to that question of posture of\nrevolt vs. philosophical substance, at different moments and in\ndifferent circumstances by N\u00e9gritude writers. Nevertheless, it\ncan be said that C\u00e9saire and Damas have put more emphasis on\nthe dimension of poetic revolt while Senghor has insisted more on\narticulating N\u00e9gritude as a philosophical content, as\n\u201cthe sum total of the values of civilization of the Black\nWorld\u201d, thus implying that it is an ontology, an aesthetics, an\nepistemology, or a politics.\n3. Manifestos for N\u00e9gritude\n\nFollowing the example of Alain Locke, Leon Damas in 1947 and\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor a year later published\nAnthologies of poetry to manifest the existence of\nN\u00e9gritude as an aesthetics and as a literary movement.\n\nIn the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to his Po\u00e8tes\nd\u2019expression fran\u00e7aise 1900\u20131945, Damas\nproclaimed that \u201cthe time of blocking out and inhibition\u201d\nhad now given place to \u201canother age: that in which the colonized\nman becomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a\nnovelist or a story-teller, an essayist or a poet.\u201d And he\nstated the literary and political significance of his\nAnthology in non ambiguous terms: \u201cPoverty, illiteracy,\nexploitation of man by man, social and political racism suffered by\nthe black or the yellow, forced labor, inequalities, lies,\nresignation, swindles, prejudices, complacencies, cowardice, failures,\ncrimes committed in the name of liberty, of equality, of fraternity,\nthat is the theme of this indigenous poetry in French\u201d (Damas\n1947, 10). It is important to notice that he meant his anthology to be\na manifesto, not so much for N\u00e9gritude, than for the Colonized\nin general, as he insisted that the sufferings of colonialism were the\nburden of \u201cthe black and the yellow\u201d and as he featured in\nthe selection poets from Indochina and Madagascar. Or rather Damas\nunderstood the concept of N\u00e9gritude (in fact the word does not\nappear in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the anthology) to\nencompass people of color in general as they were under the domination\nof European colonialism. This is a broader meaning of N\u00e9gritude\nthat the \u201cfathers\u201d of the movement always kept in mind.\nDamas\u2019 view about the substance of the poetry he was presenting,\nabout what the poets gathered in his book had in common besides living\nthe same colonial situation, is generally the same as Etienne\nL\u00e9ro\u2019s, whose \u201cMis\u00e8re d\u2019une\npo\u00e9sie\u201d (\u201cPoverty of a Poetry\u201d) he quotes\n abundantly.[2]\n In a vitalistic language that characterizes N\u00e9gritude\nL\u00e9on Damas opposes, using L\u00e9ro\u2019s language, the\nvitality of this \u201cnew poetry\u201d to what he denounced as\n\u201cwhite literary decadence\u201d (to be contrasted with the\nrevolutionary nature of surrealist philosophy and literature). He\nquoted in particular L\u00e9ro\u2019s denunciation of writers from\nthe Caribbean \u201cmulatto society, intellectually \u2026 corrupt\nand literarily nourished with white decadence\u201d to the point that\nsome of them would make it a matter of pride that a white person could\nread their whole book without being able to tell \u201cwhat their\nactual complexion was\u201d (Damas 1947, 13). The\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d was indeed a manifesto for N\u00e9gritude\nas a vital poetic force that Damas (and L\u00e9ro) identified as\n\u201cthe wind rising from Black America\u201d which in turn\nexpresses \u201cthe African love for life, the African joy in love,\nthe African dream of death\u201d (Damas 1947, 13).\n\nSenghor\u2019s Anthologie de la nouvelle po\u00e9sie\nn\u00e8gre et malgache de langue fran\u00e7aise, (An\nAnthology of the New Negro and Malagasy Poetry in French), published\nin 1948, would eventually overshadow Damas\u2019 anthology and his\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to it as a manifesto for the\nN\u00e9gritude movement. Senghor\u2019s own\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d is just five short paragraphs as it devoted\nonly to the technicalities of selecting the poets gathered in the book\n(interestingly, unlike Damas, his choice is restricted to the\n\u201cBlacks\u201d, the Malagasies being according to him\n\u201cm\u00e9laniens\u201d (Senghor 1948, 2)). But what\ncontributed greatly to the fame of the Anthology and\npropelled N\u00e9gritude into the broad intellectual conversation\nwas the \u201cPreface\u201d written for it by French philosopher and\npublic intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre (1906\u20131980). The title of\nthe \u201cpreface\u201d, Black Orpheus, referring to the\nGreek myth about the evocative force of poetry but also about its\neventual impotence in front of fate and death, fully expresses what\ncan be called the kiss of death the existentialist philosopher gave to\nthe movement.\n4. The inescapable disappearance of Eurydice\n\nBy writing Black Orpheus as an account of the ultimate\nmeaning of the black poetry gathered in the Anthology Sartre\ntransformed N\u00e9gritude into an illustration of his own\nphilosophical theses and durably set the terms in which the concept\nwas to be discussed from then on.\n\nOne important point made by Sartre was that N\u00e9gritude was first\nand foremost a black poetic appropriation of the French language.\nUnlike other nationalisms, he explained, which reclaimed the tongue of\nthe people against the imperialist imposition of the language by which\nthey were governed, black people had to use the language of domination\nimposed by French colonialism as cement for their shared\nN\u00e9gritude and as \u201cmiraculous\n weapons\u201d[3]\n against that same domination. In so doing they radically transformed\nit, manifesting through their poetry that there was nothing natural\nand unquestionable in the way in which the language would identify\nBeing with Good, Beautiful, Right and White. The simple song of a\nblack poet chanting in French the beauty of the naked blackness of the\nwoman he loved, Sartre wrote, would then appear to the ears of French\npeople a fundamental violence against their linguistic and indeed\nontological self assurance; in spite of the fact that the poem was not\neven meant for them, or rather because of that. In the poetry of\nN\u00e9gritude they would be struck by the discovery of their own\nlanguage as unfamiliar and hitherto unheard of, especially when that\npoetry makes the best of surrealist writing as it \u201csmashes [the\nwords] together, breaks their customary associations, and couples them\nby force\u201d (Sartre 1976, 26). But then again one knows that such\nan unsettling of language and indeed its \u201cauto\ndestruction\u201d is the \u201cprofound aim of French poetry\n\u2026 from Mallarm\u00e9 to the Surrealists\u201d (1976, 25).\nTherefore, Sartre concludes, N\u00e9gritude has achieved that goal:\nthe poets of N\u00e9gritude have taken to its end what surrealist\nwriters had been calling for.\n\nSo while he praised N\u00e9gritude as the revolutionary poetry of\nthe time, Sartre maintained the traditional Marxist view about the\nproletariat being the sole true revolutionary class and actor of\nhistory. Just as Eurydice was the creation of Orpheus\u2019 power of\nevocation, N\u00e9gritude was a creation of poetry, a \u201cMyth\ndolorous and full of hope\u201d and like \u201ca woman who is born\nto die\u201d (Sartre 1976, 63). History and its laws had already\ncondemned N\u00e9gritude to be just a Poem, indeed a swan song: the\nfuture of liberation was in the hand of the proletariat, the universal\nclass who was going to bring effective revolution and liberation from\nall oppressions. When all is said and done and N\u00e9gritude has\npermitted the blacks to \u201craise relentlessly the great negro cry\nuntil the foundations of the world shall tremble\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire\u2019s Les armes miraculeuses quoted by\nSartre as the last words of Black Orpheus), it will have to\nbe shed \u201cto the profit of the Revolution\u201d (1976, 65) by\nthe only true actor of history which is the proletariat. In other\nwords the \u201cbeing-in-the-world of the Negro\u201d as Sartre\ndefined N\u00e9gritude using Heideggerian language is\n\u201csubjective\u201d while class is \u201cobjective\u201d: the\nnotion of race is concrete and particular, Sartre writes, while that\nof class is universal and abstract; in the terminology of Karl Jaspers\nthe first resorts to \u201ccomprehension\u201d while the latter\nresorts to \u201cintellection\u201d (1976, 59).\n\nAgain, Sartre\u2019s preface was a real kiss of death as it played an\nimmense role in popularizing the N\u00e9gritude movement and\ncontributed to establishing Senghor\u2019s Anthology as its\nmanifesto, but at the same time dismissed its historical significance\nby emphasizing that its being was ultimately only poetic, without real\n substance.[4]\n And in fact, ironically, Black Orpheus contained and\nannounced most of the criticisms that would be directed at\nN\u00e9gritude afterwards. First the criticism which very quickly\ncame from certain Marxists who accused N\u00e9gritude of creating\nthe distraction of \u201crace\u201d where there should be only a\nfocus on objective social contradictions in the historic phase of the\nstruggle of the Proletariat to bring authentic liberation to the\noppressed workers in Europe and the dominated peoples in the\n world.[5]\n To that criticism some would add that by emphasizing the particular\nand the concrete of race over the objective and the universal of the\nstruggle against capitalism and imperialism, the \u201cfathers\u201d\nof N\u00e9gritude, Senghor more specifically (since he led his\ncountry to independence and became its president for twenty years),\nseemed to imply that some cultural recognition and reconciliation was\nall that was needed: they accused N\u00e9gritude of being, for that\nreason, an ideology for neocolonialism. Sartre\u2019s\n\u201cpreface\u201d also foreshadowed the accusation of being an\nunfounded essentialism promoting the notion that black people shared a\ncommon identity, partaking in some enduring African-ness that defines\nthem beyond differences in historical trajectories and circumstances,\npersonal or collective.\n\nThe paradox of Sartre\u2019s preface to the Anthology by\nSenghor is that in many respects the N\u00e9gritude movement had,\nafter Black Orpheus, to define itself against Sartre\u2019s\npositioning of its philosophical meaning. It did so (1) by insisting\nthat it was not a mere particularism defined as the\nantithesis to a white supremacist view (with black self\naffirmation using the figure of inversion that Sartre characterized as\nan anti-racist racism (1976, 59)), before some dialectical post-racial\nsynthesis; (2) by showing that there was something\nsubstantial (and not just poetic) in the reference to African values\nof civilization by which Senghor had defined N\u00e9gritude: that\nN\u00e9gritude was indeed an ontology, an epistemology, an\naesthetics and a politics.\n5. N\u00e9gritude as ontology\n\nWhen it comes to defining the substance of N\u00e9gritude, there is\nan important difference between the three main heralds of the\nmovement. Damas, a poet more than a theorist, spoke of it in the\n\u201cintroduction\u201d of his anthology as the vital force behind\nany new and true\u2014that is liberating\u2014poetry. As to\nC\u00e9saire, he has often insisted that N\u00e9gritude was\nprimarily the reclaiming of a heritage in order to regain initiative.\nHe declared:\n\nN\u00e9gritude, in my eyes, is not a philosophy. N\u00e9gritude is\nnot a metaphysics. N\u00e9gritude is not a pretentious conception of\nthe universe. It is a way of living history within history: the\nhistory of a community whose experience appears to be \u2026 unique,\nwith its deportation of populations, its transfer of people from one\ncontinent to another, its distant memories of old beliefs, its\nfragments of murdered cultures. How can we not believe that all this,\nwhich has its own coherence, constitutes a heritage? (2004,\n 82)[6]\n\n\nUnlike Damas and C\u00e9saire, Senghor affirmed that\nN\u00e9gritude was also the expression of a philosophy to be read in\nthe cultural products of Africa; and above all in African religions.\nDifferent as they are from one region to another, from one culture to\nanother, there is still ethnographical evidence that many of them\nshare to be founded on an ontology of life forces. \u201cThe whole\nsystem\u201d, Senghor declares, in a lecture \u201cOn\nN\u00e9gritude\u201d delivered at Lovanium University in Kinshasa,\n\u201cis founded on the notion of vital force. Pre-existing, anterior\nto being, it constitutes being. God has given vital force not only to\nmen, but also to animals, vegetables, even minerals. By which they\nare. But it is the purpose of this force to increase\u201d (1993,\n19). Senghor then explains that in the human being the increase of the\nforce is the process of her becoming a person \u201cby being\nfreer and freer within an interdependent community\u201d (1993, 19).\nHe adds that the ultimate meaning of religion is to assure the\ncontinuous increase of the vital force of the living, in particular\nthrough the main ritual of the sacrifice of an animal. This ontology\nof life forces has been summarized by Belgian philosopher Leo Apostel\nin the following propositions:\n\nTo say that something exists is to say that it exercises a\nspecific force. To be is to be a force.\nEvery force is specific (as against a pantheistic interpretation,\nsince what is asserted here is the existence of monadic, individual\nforces).\nDifferent types of beings are characterized by different\nintensities and types of forces.\nEach force can be strengthened or weakened [rein-forced\nor de-forced, as Senghor puts it].\nForces can influence and act upon each other in virtue of their\ninternal natures.\nThe universe is a hierarchy of forces organized according to their\nstrengths, starting from God and going all the way down to the mineral\nthrough the founding ancestors, the important dead, living humans,\nanimals and plants.\nDirect causal action involves the influence of more-being or\nstronger force, on less-being, weaker force. (Apostel 1981,\n 26\u201329)[7]\n\n\nPoint 6 in particular constitutes a good summary of the view shared by\nmany African religions characterized as \u201canimism\u201d while\nthe other points help understand the particular type of causality that\nhas been labeled magical thinking. As early as in 1939, at a time when\nLeon Damas had already published his first collection of poems,\nPigments (1937) and C\u00e9saire had just finished a\nversion of his Cahier d\u2019un retour au pays natal\n(\u201cNotebook of a return to my Native Land\u201d (C\u00e9saire\n2000a)), Senghor had published an essay on the philosophy of\nN\u00e9gritude entitled \u201cCe que l\u2019homme noir\napporte\u201d (\u201cWhat the Black Man Contributes\u201d). As he\nexplored in that essay the notion of rhythm as constitutive of what he\ncalled \u201cthe negro style\u201d, Senghor was trying to say that\nthe productions of African art were to be understood first and\nforemost as the language of an ontology of vital forces.\n\nSo it is not surprising that he was so enthusiastic when, six years\nlater, he discovered a book by Reverend Father Placide Tempels diving\na clear exposition of Bantu Philosophy as resting upon such\nan ontology (Tempels 1945). Tempels was a Belgian Franciscan priest\nwho went to the Congo as a missionary. He had the view that in order\nto be more efficient preaching the Gospel to the Bantu people he had\nfirst to understand the principles underlying their belief system,\ntheir customary law, their cultural habits, and so on. He explained\nthat he came to realize that one could and should go beyond mere\nethnographical description of those characteristics of the\npeople\u2019s lives and dig out a set of ontological principles on\nwhich they were founded. In other words that there existed a Bantu\nphilosophy of being underlying their laws, behaviors,\nbeliefs, politics, etc. The book, first written in Flemish then\npublished in French in 1945 by Pr\u00e9sence africaine\nunder the title La philosophie bantoue, became quite an\nevent: it was one of the very first times that an African people was\nassociated with philosophy, an intellectual pursuit considered at\nleast since Hegel to be the unique telos of Western\ncivilization.\n\nNothing probably is more indicative of the difference between\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor and his friend Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire than their respective reactions to the widely\ncelebrated book by Father Tempels. While Senghor embraced it as going\nalong the same lines he was exploring in his 1939 essay,\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s reaction was one of rejection. It is not that\nC\u00e9saire did not accept the substance of Tempels\u2019 theses.\nIn fact the summary he makes of them is perfectly adequate: \u201cNow\nthen, know that Bantu thought is essentially ontological\u201d, he\nwrites in his 1955 Discours sur le colonialisme\n[8],\u201cthat\n Bantu ontology is based on the truly fundamental notions of a life\nforce and a hierarchy of life forces; and that for the Bantu the\nontological order which defines the world comes from God and, as a\ndivine decree, must be respected\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58). In\nfact what provoked C\u00e9saire\u2019s skepticism and sarcasm\nvis-\u00e0-vis Tempels\u2019 work was its implications as a tool to\njustify and perpetuate the colonial order. \u201cSince Bantu thought\nis ontological\u201d, he tittered, \u201cthe Bantu only ask for\nsatisfaction of an ontological nature. Decent wages! Comfortable\nhousing! Food! These Bantu are pure spirits, I tell you\n\u2026\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58) Above all, there is for\nC\u00e9saire, the way in which the colonial order is made by Tempels\na new part of Bantu ontology and therefore legitimized and even\nsanctified in the eyes of the Bantu themselves: \u201cAs for the\ngovernment, why should it complain?\u201d Since the Rev. Tempels\nnotes with obvious satisfaction, \u201cfrom their first contact with\nthe white man, the Bantu considered us from the only point of view\nthat was possible to them, the point of view of their Bantu\nphilosophy\u201d and \u201cintegrated us into their hierarchy of\nlife forces at a very high level\u201d (C\u00e9saire 2000b,\n58). The final result being then that \u201cthe Bantu god will take\nresponsibility for the Belgian colonialist order, and any Bantu who\ndare to raise his hand against it will be guilty of sacrilege\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire 2000b, 58).\n\nIn sum, in the eyes of Senghor, Tempels\u2019 Bantu\nphilosophy, along with Bergson\u2019s philosophy of\n\u00e9lan vital, provided the language of life philosophy\nwhich he considered characteristic of the cultures of Africa and those\nof African\n origin.[9]\n For him N\u00e9gritude is an ontology of life forces to be\ndescribed as a vitalism. C\u00e9saire who was more skeptical about a\nphilosophical content of the word dismissed Tempels\u2019 enterprise\nnot on the basis of its substance but because of what he considered\nthe intention behind the text of Bantu philosophy: an attempt\nto reform colonialism in order to perpetuate it.\n6. N\u00e9gritude as aesthetics\n\nThe aspect on which Senghor insists the most is that of\nN\u00e9gritude as a philosophy of African art. One of the main\nactivities of Senghor when he first arrived in Paris at the end of the\n1920s was to visit the ethnographical museum at Place Trocad\u00e9ro\nin Paris. By then the vogue of art n\u00e8gre (black art)\nhad already produced its effects on modern European art. Pablo\nPicasso, in particular, in 1906 had made the turn of making African\nsculptures and masks part of his artistic pursuit: his Demoiselles\nd\u2019Avignon, painted in 1906, manifested that move. The\n1930s, the years when Senghor, C\u00e9saire and Damas started\nwriting, is the time when what was labeled \u201cprimitive\nobjects\u201d were now more widely perceived as art, beyond the\ncircles of the artistic avant-garde. The Universal Exposition in Paris\nin 1931 showed that new\n \u201csensibility\u201d.[10]\n\nSenghor wanted N\u00e9gritude to be the philosophy of the\ngeometrical forms so characteristic of African masks and sculptures\nacross different regions and cultures. He would often explain that the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of art in Africa is not to reproduce or\nembellish reality but to establish the connection with what he labeled\nthe sub-reality that is the universe of vital forces. What\nmodern art understood from the consideration of art\nn\u00e8gre is that the issue was not anymore to simply\nreproduce sensible appearances but to deal with the forces hidden\nbeneath the surface of things. That is why the African objects at the\nTrocad\u00e9ro museum were at once religious and artistic\nartifacts.\n\nPlastic forms are life forces, they are rhythms. So objects such as\nmasks or sculptures are to be read as combinations of rhythms as we\ncan see in the following aesthetic analysis by Senghor of a feminine\nstatuette from Baule culture (in today Ivory Coast): \u201cIn it, two\nthemes of sweetness sing an alternating song. The breasts are ripe\nfruits. The chin and the knees, the rump and the calves are also\nfruits or breasts. The neck, the arms and the thighs are columns of\nblack\n honey.\u201d[11]\n This reading establishes the object as a composition of two rhythmic\nseries (what is referred to here, poetically, as two themes of\nsweetness): the concave forms of the breasts, chin, knees, rump and\ncalves, on the one hand; on the other hand, the cylindrical forms that\nare the neck, the arms and the thighs. This example indicates what\nSenghor understands by \u201crhythm\u201d and illustrates what he\nsees as its omnipresence in Black aesthetic products, as he certainly\nremembers here the notion expressed, ten years before by Jane Nardal,\nof a \u201crule of rhythm, the sovereign master of [black]\nbodies\u201d (Nardal, 2002, 105). In his first essay on\nN\u00e9gritude, \u201cWhat the Black Man Contributes\u201d,\nSenghor wrote:\n\nThis ordering force that constitutes Negro style is rhythm.\nIt is the most sensible and the least material thing. It is the vital\nelement par excellence. It is the primary condition for, and sign of,\nart, as respiration is of life \u2013 respiration that rushes or\nslows down, becomes regular or spasmodic, depending on the\nbeing\u2019s tension, the degree and quality of the emotion. Such is\nrhythm, originally, in its purity, such is it in the masterpieces of\nNegro art, particularly in sculpture. It is composed of one theme\n\u2013 sculptural form \u2013 that is opposed to a brother theme,\nlike inhalation is opposed to exhalation, and that is reprised. It is\nnot a symmetry that engenders monotony; rhythm is alive, it is free.\nFor reprise is not redundancy, or repetition. The theme is reprised at\nanother place, on another level, in another combination, in a\nvariation. And it produces something like another tone, another\ntimbre, another accent. And the general effect is intensified by this,\nnot without nuances. This is how rhythm acts, despotically, on what is\nleast intellectual in us, to make us enter into the spirituality of\nthe object; and this attitude of abandon that we have is itself\nrhythmic. (Senghor 1964, 296)\n\n\nSeventeen years later he would reiterate the same credo:\n\nWhat is rhythm? It is the architecture of being, the internal\ndynamism that gives it form, the system of waves it emanates toward\nthe Others, the pure expression of vital force. Rhythm is the\nvibrating shock, the force that, through the senses, seizes us at the\nroot of being. It expresses itself through the most material\nand sensual means: lines, surfaces, colors, and volumes in\narchitecture, sculpture and painting; accents in poetry and music;\nmovements in dance. But, in doing so, it organizes all this\nconcreteness toward the light of the Spirit. For the Negro\nAfrican, it is insofar as it is incarnate in sensuality that rhythm\nilluminates the\n Spirit.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, L.S. Senghor, then the President of Senegal since the country\nbecame independent in 1960, organized in Dakar an international event\nthat he obviously intended to be a great moment of celebration of what\nhe had been pursuing his whole life: the World Festival of Black Arts,\nmeant to be the concrete manifestation of black aesthetics in all its\ndimensions. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, one of the most celebrated\nguests of honor at the Festival, was invited to give a \u201cLecture\non African Art\u201d (\u201cDiscours sur l\u2019art\n africain\u201d).[13]\n He first insisted on the question of the role and significance of art\nin general in the modern world, quoting the poet Saint-John Perse:\n\u201cWhen mythology falls apart, it is in poetry that the divine\nfinds refuge \u2026 it is from poetic imagination that the fierce\npassion of people seeking light gets its flame\u201d\n(Th\u00e9bia-Melsan 2000, 22). What N\u00e9gritude poets did even\nif he does not like the word N\u00e9gritude at all, declares\nC\u00e9saire, and in spite of their failings, was just that: to be\nlight bearers for Africa. Then he proceeded to ask whether African art\nof the past will be a catalyst for African art in the present and the\nfuture the way it had been for European art at the beginning of the\ntwentieth century. That was a way for him of calling the attention on\nthe questions at the core of his thinking about aesthetics (but also\npolitics): how to regain initiative? How to avoid the lack of\nauthenticity of sheer imitation or mimesis: mimesis of Europe\nas well as mimesis of one\u2019s own artistic tradition.\n\nAs to his philosophy of art as such, C\u00e9saire\u2019s views\nfollow consistently from his surrealist poetics and eventually\nconverge with his friend Senghor\u2019s. C\u00e9saire\u2019s\nnotion of the primordial role that should be played by the\nDionysian in art versus the Apollonian. These are\ncategories that C\u00e9saire and Senghor adopted from\nNietzsche\u2019s philosophy (Nietzsche\u2019s Birth of\nTragedy) to express the opposition between the primal, obscure\nforce of life considered as an organic whole (the Dionysian) on the\none hand, and on the other hand the plastic beauty or the form which\nbrings into light the individuality of the object (the Apollonian):\nthe Dionysian speaks to our emotion while the Apollonian speaks to our\nintellectuality. C\u00e9saire evokes such a contrast when he states\nthat: \u201cThe poetically beautiful is not merely beauty of\nexpression or muscular euphoria. A too Apollonian or gymnastic idea of\nbeauty paradoxically runs the risk of skinning, stuffing, and\nhardening it.\u201d This is the seventh and final thesis of the\npropositions summarizing his views about Poetry and\n Knowledge[14]\n and it is in perfect resonance with Senghor\u2019s view of African\nart as the language of the ontology of vital forces.\n\nIn conclusion, N\u00e9gritude as aesthetics is predicated on such\noppositions as those between sub-reality (or sur-reality) and\nappearance, force and form, emotion and intellect, Dionysian and\nApollonian. C\u00e9saire, Damas (as shown in the preface of his\nanthology) and Senghor all agreed that art was a vital\nresponse to the mechanistic and de-humanizing philosophy that produced\n(and was produced by) modern Europe. And like Nietzsche, they believed\nthat art was another approach by which a sense of the world as\ntotality would be restored. These lines from C\u00e9saire\u2019s\n\u201cDiscourse on African Art\u201d delivered in Dakar on April 6,\n1966, at the opening of the \u201cWorld Festival of Negro Arts\u201d\nsummarize N\u00e9gritude philosophy of the significance of art,\nespecially black art: \u201cThrough art, the reified world becomes\nagain the human world, the world of living realities, the world of\ncommunication and participation. From a collection of things, poetry\nand art remake the world, a world which is whole, which is total and\nharmonious. And that is why poetry is youth. It is the force that\ngives back to the world its prime vitality, which gives back to\neverything its aura of marvelous by replacing it within the original\ntotality\u201d (Th\u00e9bia-Melsan, 2000, 21).\n\nAnd it can be argued that it is because of that significance of art\nthat N\u00e9gritude also presented itself as another type of\nknowledge or epistemology and as another politics.\n7. N\u00e9gritude as epistemology\n\nIn the same 1939 essay in which he explored what he called the\n\u201crhythmic attitude\u201d by which we enter in profound\nconnection with the object of art, its reality or its sub-reality,\nSenghor wrote the statement which is probably the most controversial\nof all his formulations of the philosophy of N\u00e9gritude:\n\u201cEmotion is Negro, as reason is Hellenic\u201d\n(\u201cL\u2019\u00e9motion est n\u00e8gre, comme la raison\nh\u00e9ll\u00e8ne\u201d). (Senghor 1964, 288) The criticism\nwas that the formula was an acceptance of the ethnological discourse\nof the Levy-Bruhlian type making a distinction between western\nsocieties suffused with rationality and the colonized world of what he\nlabeled \u201cinferior societies\u201d, under the rule of\n\u201cprimitive mentality\u201d. While rationality is defined by the\nuse of the logical principles of identity, contradiction and excluded\nmiddle and the empirical notion of causality, primitive mentality\nfunctions according to a law of \u201cparticipation\u201d and\nmagical thinking. The law means that a person can be herself and at\nthe same time be \u2013or rather participate in the being\nof\u2014her totem animal ignoring (or rather indifferent to) the\nprinciple of contradiction, and magical thinking, superposing a\nsupernatural world to reality, allows for example action from distance\nin the absence of any causal link between two phenomena. (Levy-Bruhl\n1926) For his critics, Senghor\u2019s formula did ratify the view of\nLucien Levy-Bruhl, while the ethnologist himself eventually recanted\nthem in his Notebooks of Lucien Levy-Bruhl posthumously\npublished ten years after his death in 1939. Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s famous lines from The Notebook for a Return\nto the Native Land echo Senghor\u2019s formula:\n\nThose who have invented neither powder nor the compass\n\nThose who have tamed neither gas nor electricity\n\nThose who have explored neither the seas nor the skies\n\n\u2026\n\nBut they abandon themselves, possessed, to the essence of all things\n\nIgnoring surfaces but possessed by the movement of all things\n\nHeedless, taking no account, but playing the game of the world.\n\nTruly the elder sons of the world\n\nPorous to every breath of the world\n\nFlesh of the flesh of the world throbbing with the very movement of\nthe world.\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre who quoted these verses in Black Orpheus,\n(1976, 43\u201344) immediately after made this remark: \u201cUpon\nreading this poem, one cannot help but think of the famous distinction\nwhich Bergson established between intelligence and intuition\u201d\n(1976, 44). That remark makes an important point:\n\u201cemotion\u201d and \u201cintuition\u201d as approaches to\nreality in N\u00e9gritude philosophy have more to do with Bergsonian\nphilosophy than with Levy-Bruhlian ethnology. Donna Jones rightly\nspeaks of Negritude as an \u201cAfro-Bergsonian epistemology\u201d.\n(Jones, 2010) Senghor did use the language of the author of\nPrimitive Mentality, (Levy-Bruhl 1923) for example when he\nwrote in his 1956 article on \u201cNegro African Aesthetics\u201d\nthat \u201cEuropean reason is analytical by utilization, Negro reason\nis intuitive by participation\u201d (1964, 203). But he also stated\nclearly, as early as in 1945, six years after the essay in which the\n(in)famous formula was written: \u201cBut are the differences not in\nthe ratio between elements more than in their nature? Underneath the\ndifferences, are there not more essential similarities? Above all, is\nreason not identical among men? I do not believe in\n\u2018prelogical mentality.\u2019 The mind cannot be prelogical, and\nit can even less be alogical\u201d (1964, 42). This affirmation is\nclearly directed at Levy-Bruhl. So the influence on his thinking\nclaimed by Senghor is rather Henri Bergson\u2019s. The poet often\nrefers to the importance of the \u201c1889 Revolution\u201d, in\nreference to the year of publication of Bergson\u2019s Essay on\nthe immediate data of consciousness. Bergson, for Senghor, has\ngiven a philosophical expression to a new paradigm which, unlike\nCartesianism and, even before it, Aristotelianism, makes room for a\ntype of knowledge which does not divide by analysis the subject from\nthe object and the object into its constitutive separated parts:\ndifferent from the reason-that-separates, says Senghor following\nBergson, there is a reason-that-embraces, which makes us experience\n\u201cthe lived identity of knowledge and the known, the lived and\nthe thought, the lived and the real\u201d (1971, 287). That approach\nof reality is the other side of our analytical intelligence: according\nto Bergson, the push of life in evolution, the \u00e9lan\nvital, has produced consciousness. Now \u201cconsciousness, in\nman, is pre-eminently intellect. It might have been, it ought, so it\nseems, to have been also intuition. Intuition and intellect represent\ntwo opposite directions of the work of consciousness: intuition goes\nin the very direction of life, intellect goes in the inverse\ndirection, and thus finds itself naturally in accordance with the\nmovement of matter. A complete and perfect humanity would be that in\nwhich these two forms of conscious activity should attain their full\ndevelopment\u201d (Bergson 1944, 291\u2013292). Clearly Bergson does\nnot see \u201cintuition\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d as\ndividing humanity into different types: he calls for their equal\ndevelopment in a fully accomplished humanity.\n\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from Senghor\u2019s Bergsonism. First,\nthe epistemology of N\u00e9gritude, what he calls a Negro way of\nknowing does not simply reproduce Levy-Bruhl\u2019s radical cognitive\ndualism which ultimately divides humanity into two categories, the\nEuropean and the non-European. It is rather a way of emphasizing the\nrole played by what Bergson has called \u201cintuition\u201d in the\nproduction of African cultural objects, more particularly African art.\nBecause, and this is the second conclusion, when he speaks of an\nAfrican epistemology in fact Senghor is still speaking about art and\naesthetics. He is speaking about art as knowledge, art as a particular\napproach to reality, art as the realm par excellence of intuitive\nknowledge or emotion. That concept is to be understood in relation to\nthe distinction made by Henri Bergson in his 1932 book on The two\nsources of morality and Religion between two opposed notions\nof \u201cemotion\u201d. One that is a reaction, a \u201cstirring of\nsensibility by representation\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 43]), and one that\nis \u201ca cause and not an effect\u201d, that is \u201cpregnant\nwith representations\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 44]). The first Bergson\ncalls \u201cinfra-intellectual\u201d while the second is\n\u201csupra-intellectual\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 44]). Clearly,\nSenghor\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d corresponds to the creative one,\nthe one \u201cpregnant with representations\u201d. Its\nmeaning in Senghor\u2019s formula is also consonant\nwith its definition by Jean-Paul Sartre as a way of seeing the\nworld as a \u201cnon-instrumental totality\u201d: \u201cin this\ncase, writes Sartre, the categories of the world will act upon\nconsciousness immediately. They are present to it without\ndistance\u201d (Sartre 1989, 52,90).\n\nWe can now conclude with a reexamination of Senghor\u2019s infamous\nformula, which he kept explaining again and again: \u201cEmotion is\nNegro as Reason is Hellenic\u201d. To pay attention to the context in\nwhich it was written is to recall that Senghor, in the late 1930s was\nabsorbing not only ethnological literature but also writings about\n\u201cart n\u00e8gre\u201d. In particular a book that he refers to\nin a simple footnote but which was very influential on his thinking:\nPrimitive Negro Sculpture by Paul Guillaume and Thomas Munro,\npublished in the US in 1926 and translated into French in 1929. One of\nthe main points made in the book was to contrast Greco-Roman statuary\nexpressing the ideal of the beautiful form as it exists in reality\neven if it is transfigured by art and African sculpture as a\nmanifestation of the life force beneath the appearances of things.\nWhen that context is taken into account, it becomes clear that\nSenghor\u2019s neatly crafted formula (it is an alexandrine in\nFrench) can be read as an analogy: Hellenic art is to analytic reason\nwhat African art is to emotion. And thus it becomes less scandalous as\nthe simple expression of the Nietzschean way in which Senghor\u2019s\nN\u00e9gritude has considered art as knowledge and aesthetics as\nepistemology. As Abiola Irele has rightly remarked:\n\u201cSenghor\u2019s theory of the African method of knowledge and\nhis aesthetic theory\u201d are not just \u201cintimately related\n[but] even coincide\u201d (Irele 1990, 75). Senghor considers that\nmethod, that form of vital knowledge, as \u201cthe way\nof the Africans\u201d and he declares that Bergsonism represents but\n\u201ca return\u201d to it (Senghor, 1993, 125).\n8. N\u00e9gritude as politics\n\nIn 1956 Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire wrote a resounding public letter to\nMaurice Thorez, then the General Secretary of the French Communist\nParty, telling him that he was resigning from the party. He had been a\nmember for more than ten years and had been elected in 1946 as a\ncommunist mayor of Fort-de-France then as a Representative of France\nin the French Assembly. The three \u201cfathers\u201d of\nN\u00e9gritude found themselves members of the same French\nParliament: Senghor who had been elected a deputy from Senegal in 1946\nwas sitting with the Socialists and so was L\u00e9on Damas who got\nelected to represent Guiana in 1948.\n\nIn his Letter to Maurice Thorez, C\u00e9saire started by\nenumerating his many grievances against a communist party that had\nuncritically pledged total allegiance to Russia before he came to\n\u201cconsiderations related to [his] position as a man of\n color.\u201d[15]\n As a person of African descent, he declared, his position expressed\nthe singularity of a \u201csituation in the world which cannot be\nconfused with any other \u2026 of \u2026 problems which cannot be\nreduced to any other problem \u2026 [and] of [a] history,\nconstructed out of terrible misfortunes, that belong to no one\nelse\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 147). That is why \u201cblack\npeoples\u201d, he argued, needed to have their own organizations,\n\u201cmade for them, made by them, and adapted to ends that they\nalone [could] determine\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 148).\nC\u00e9saire insisted also that Stalinist\n\u201cfraternalism,\u201d with its notions of the \u201cadvanced\npeople\u201d who must help \u201cpeoples who are behind,\u201d says\nnothing different than \u201ccolonialist paternalism.\u201d\n(C\u00e9saire, 2010, 149)\n\nUltimately, what C\u00e9saire was seeking in formulations such as\n\u201cit should be Marxism and communism at the service of black\npeoples, not black peoples at the service of the doctrine\u201d was\nto define the notion of a people by means of culture rather than\npolitics. And consequently he was refusing to just dilute the cultural\ndimension of the existential response of black peoples to colonial\nnegation in Marxist universalism: C\u00e9saire\u2019s\n\u201cletter\u201d was also, eight years later, a political response\nto Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s Black Orpheus. Is my decision an\nexpression of \u201cprovincialism\u201d, C\u00e9saire asked at the\nend of his letter. \u201cNot at all\u201d, he answered. \u201cI am\nnot burying myself in a narrow particularism. But neither do I want to\nlose myself in an emaciated universalism. There are two ways to lose\noneself: walled segregation in the particular or dilution in the\n\u2018universal\u2019\u201d (C\u00e9saire, 2010, 152).\n\nC\u00e9saire called then for the promotion of an \u201cAfrican\nvariety of communism\u201d as a way of avoiding both pitfalls.\nSenghor also has insisted on an African socialism born of a\n\u201cNegro African re-reading of Marx.\u201d This African socialism\nof Senghor could be presented briefly in two fundamental points: first\nthe insistence that it is the early Marx who can truly inspire an\nAfrican doctrine of socialism, second the understanding that socialism\nis a natural development of African societies and cultures. So in\narticle titled \u201cMarxism and humanism\u201d and published in\n1948 in Revue socialiste (a Journal sponsored by the French\nSocialist Party) Senghor notes that which will later be the point of\ndeparture for Louis Althusser\u2019s reading of Marx: between the\nearly Marx and the Marx who writes The Capital,\nthere is an epistemological break. It is to be recalled here that in\n1844 in Paris, Marx wrote a certain number of texts that he just\nabandoned afterwards to \u201cthe criticism of the mice\u201d. Those\ntexts, known as The 1844 Manuscripts were later discovered\nand published in Leipzig in 1932. They manifest that Marx\u2019s\nthinking and language were then fundamentally ethical as he was\noutraged by human condition under capitalist regime characterized by\nreification and alienation: human beings are alienated because, Marx\nwrites, the product of their work sucks out their life force and\nstands in front of them as strange and hostile artifacts. Alienation\nis the sentiment of living in exile and imprisoned in a de-humanized\nworld. The Marx who writes the Capital will abandon that\nmoral language and analyze the condition of the working class through\ntechnical concepts, for example that of extortion of surplus value.\nWhile Althusser considered this break the advent of Marxist science as\nan \u201canti-humanist theory\u201d Senghor saw it as self-betrayal\nby Marx repudiating his identity as a philosopher and giving to his\nviews the appearance of dogmatic economic petrifactions. The task of\nan African re-reading of Marx is then\n\nTo save Marx the humanist, metaphysician, dialectician and artist\nfrom a narrowly materialist, economistic, positivist, realist\nMarxism;\nTo invent an African path to socialism which is inspired by black\nspiritualities, and which continues the tradition of communalism on\nthe continent.\n\n\nThe concept of alienation in particular, so central in the writings of\nthe early Marx are at the heart of Senghor\u2019s reflections on\nMarxism and liberation. Liberation for Senghor is liberation from all\nforces of alienation, natural and sociopolitical. And in his 1948\narticle he writes about the early works of Marx: \u201cFor us, men of\n1947, men living after two world wars, we who have just escaped the\nbloodthirsty contempt of dictators and who are threatened by other\ndictatorships, what profit is to be had in these works of youth! They\nso nicely encapsulate the ethical principles of Marx, who proposes as\nthe object of our practical activity the total liberation of\nman.\u201d In Senghor\u2019s vitalistic philosophy, total liberation\nwill be reached when the human being reaches the stage when her\nartistic end can now flourish, when the evolution from homo\nfaber to homo sapiens has now given birth to homo\nartifex.\n9. N\u00e9gritude beyond N\u00e9gritude\n\nReflecting on what has been achieved by the N\u00e9gritude movement,\nLucius Outlaw notes that for all the criticisms it has received,\n\u201cnonetheless, the N\u00e9gritude arguments, fundamentally,\ninvolved a profound displacement of the African invented by\nEuropeans.\u201d And he continues: \u201cIt is this African\nchallenge and displacement, through radical critique and\ncounter-construction, that have been deconstructive in particularly\npowerful and influential ways: involving direct attacks on the assumed\nembodiment of the paragon of humanity in whites of Europe, an attack\nthat forces this embodiment back upon itself, forces it to confront\nits own historicity, its own wretched history of atrocities, and the\nstench of the decay announcing the impending death of the hegemonic\nideal of the Greco-European Rational Man\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 67).\n\nL. Outlaw acknowledges that that was the main point of Sartre\u2019s\nBlack Orpheus. It could now be argued that the question,\ntoday, is no longer that of a \u201cdeconstructive\nchallenge\u201d to \u201cthe hegemonic ideal of the Greco-European\nRational Man\u201d but that of what Outlaw calls \u201cthe\nreconstructive aspects of this challenge\u201d (Outlaw 1996, 68). Has\nN\u00e9gritude anything to contribute, today, to that\nreconstructive aspect? What does it say about the present and future\nof Black arts, since N\u00e9gritude as ontology, as epistemology,\nand even as politics takes us back, according to C\u00e9saire and\nSenghor, to the philosophy of art considered as a vital knowledge of a\nreality conceived as a web of forces?\n\nTo such a question, it can be said that C\u00e9saire had given an\nanswer in the conclusion of his 1966 Dakar address. There could be no\nprescription of what African art should be. There is no model it\nshould imitate not even its own past. It has to continuously invent\nitself and that self invention is not to be separated from the\nquestion of Africa\u2019s self invention. \u201cAfrican art of\ntomorrow will be worth what Africa and the African of tomorrow are\nworth\u201d, C\u00e9saire declared before ending his lecture with\nthese final words: \u201c\u2026 the future of African art is in our\nhands. That is why to the African Heads of States who say: African\nartists, work to save African art, here is what we respond: people of\nAfrica and first of all you, African politicians, because you have\nmore responsibility, give us good African politics, make us a good\nAfrica, create for us an Africa where there are still reasons for\nhope, means for fulfillment, reasons to be proud, give back to Africa\ndignity and health, and African art will be saved\u201d\n(Th\u00e9bia Melsan 2000, 25\u201326).\n\nOne way of raising the question of political relevance is to ask: is\nthere any room for a version of N\u00e9gritude in what could be\nconsidered as a philosophical foundation of black\n solidarity?[16]\n In September 1956, at the First Meeting of Black Writers and Artists\nheld in Paris, at the Sorbonne, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire gave a\nlecture on \u201cCulture and Colonization\u201d (C\u00e9saire\n1956). This was quite a historic reflection, at a time of maturity for\nthe N\u00e9gritude movement and just a few months before the shaking\nof decolonizations started with the independence of Ghana, on the\nrelationship between N\u00e9gritude and Pan-Africanism. \u201cWhat\nis the common denominator\u201d, C\u00e9saire started his lecture\nby asking, \u201cin this assembly gathering people as diverse as\nAfricans from Black Africa, North Americans, Caribbeans and\nMalagasies?\u201d The first obvious answer, he declared, was that\nthey all lived in a situation that could be described as colonial,\nsemi-colonial or para-colonial. In fact, he continued, there are two\naspects in the solidarity of people of African descent gathered then\nat the Sorbonne: one that could be characterized as\n\u201chorizontal\u201d and one \u201cvertical\u201d. The\nhorizontal solidarity is political: Pan-Africanism or Black solidarity\nbetween Africans and the African Diaspora is their common response to\nthe situation of submission to colonialism and racism. The vertical\nsolidarity or \u201csolidarity throughout time\u201d is the way\npeople of African descent manifest different faces of an African\ncivilization. Not to be misunderstood, C\u00e9saire hastens\nto make the precision, with cultural commonality. African cultures in\nAfrica and in the African Diasporas are at least as different as\nItalian culture would be from Norwegian culture. But they share\ncivilizational traits in the same way Norwegian and Italian cultures\nshare European traits. C\u00e9saire\u2019s distinction between\ncultures (characterized by difference) and civilization (defined by\nthe existence of commonalities) would mean that the\n\u201cvertical\u201d dimension of Pan-Africanism is what could be\nidentified as N\u00e9gritude. How do we see Pan-Africanism\ntoday?\n\nOur times are dominated by the postcolonial and anti-essentialist view\nthat differences should not be subsumed under a notion of Black\nidentity which might have worked as a response to colonial negation\nbut does not have any substantial meaning (just what Sartre said in\n1948, when he labeled N\u00e9gritude an \u201canti-racist\nracism\u201d, which Senghor and C\u00e9saire forcefully dismissed,\ninsisting that their antiracist combat should never be confused with\nracism, even a counter or a reverse one). As an example, the\ncr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the Caribbean claimed\ncreoleness as a continuous process of hybridization (\u201cNeither\nEuropeans, nor Africans, nor Asians, we proclaim ourselves\nCreoles\u201d, the Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 writers famously stated at\nthe beginning of the manifesto (Bernab\u00e9, Chamoiseau, and\nConfiant 1990, 75)) turning its back on C\u00e9saire\u2019s\nN\u00e9gritude and his claim of an African heritage as constitutive\nof his identity: N\u00e9gritude is ante-creole, they wrote.\nThis movement established itself as following from Edouard\nGlissant\u2019s philosophy of creolization. This philosophy is based\non a distinction between what Glissant calls \u201catavistic\ncultures\u201d grounded in some \u201ccreation myth of the\nworld\u201d (a group to which sub-Saharan African cultures belong),\nand what he calls \u201ccomposite cultures\u201d \u201cborn from\nhistory\u201d (Glissant 2003, 111). Thus, he asks, \u201cmy own\ngenesis, what is it if not the belly of the slave ship?\u201d Not\nAfrica, then, where the ship was coming from with its hideous freight,\nbut the journey itself, the unpredictable becoming of the voyage to\nnew shores, to new continuously proliferating, rhizomatic identities.\nThe Africanness of African-Americans could be another example. The\ndemand to be called African-Americans after having been\n\u201cNegroes\u201d then \u201cBlacks\u201d has certainly more to\ndo with the internal identity politics of being Americans in the same\nway Irish-Americans or Chinese-Americans are than with any claim of\nsubstantial solidarity with Africans. Pan-Africanism that is\nengagement and solidarity with the African continent has always been\nthe concern of a tiny elite among African Americans (even if it is\nassociated with considerable names such as Marcus Garvey or W.E.B.\nDubois).\n\nWithin the African continent, there is today a renewed attempt at\nreviving Pan-Africanism under the form of African unity, what is\nreferred to sometimes as \u201cthe United States of Africa\u201d.\nThe African Union has thus divided the continent into six great\nregions that should achieve economic and political integration in a\nnear future as a significant step towards continental unity. It is\nsignificant that the decision was made to consider the African\nDiasporas a symbolic sixth region. Is that a gesture which will remain\nsimply symbolic, a last tip of the hat from the new pragmatic\nPan-Africanism to the lyricism of N\u00e9gritude about Black\nSolidarity (it should be noted that Pan-Africanism means that the\ndivide between sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb has no significance\nand that Africans are black as well as of European or Asian descent)?\nIn 1956, C\u00e9saire seemed to have been conscious that a\n\u201chorizontal solidarity\u201d as a response to a shared\ncondition of living under colonial and racist domination was less\nproblematic than a vertical solidarity throughout time binding\ntogether peoples who have come to develop very different cultures or,\nwithin the same nations, very different subcultures. He still believed\nin that shared \u201cN\u00e9gritude\u201d as a\n\u201ccivilization\u201d under which those differences would be\nsubsumed. But above all he believed, against any \u201cincarcerating\nconception of identity\u201d (2004, 92) that N\u00e9gritude,\nultimately, amounts to the continuing fight against racism: \u201cone\ncan renounce the heritage\u201d, he declared in his Miami address but\n\u201chas one the right to renounce the fight\u201d when one\nunderstands that what is at stake today is not N\u00e9gritude but\nracism, \u201cseats of racism\u201d here and there which need to be\nconfronted if we are to \u201cconquer a new and larger\nfraternity\u201d? (2004, 90\u201392)\n\nTo dismiss too quickly N\u00e9gritude as an essentialism of the\npast, which might have been necessary as a \u201cdeconstructive\nchallenge\u201d to an oppressive colonial order but has nothing to\nsay when it comes to the call for cosmopolitanism and creolization,\nwould miss an important dimension of that multifaceted\n movement.[17]\n The essentialist language is pervasive in N\u00e9gritude\nliterature, no doubt, but so is the language of hybridity which can be\nseen as undermining it the way Penelope used to undo at night what she\nhad woven during the day. Senghor is as much a thinker of\n\u201cm\u00e9tissage\u201d (mixture) than he is a thinker of\nN\u00e9gritude. His watchword, \u201ceveryone must be mixed in\ntheir own way\u201d is as central to N\u00e9gritude as the defense\nand illustration of the values of civilization of the black world.\nThere is in fact a de-racialized use of the word\n\u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d by Senghor which is crucial to understand\nwhy painter Pablo Picasso, poets Paul Claudel, Charles P\u00e9guy or\nArthur Rimbaud, philosopher Henri Bergson, etc. have been somehow\nenrolled by Senghor under the banner of\n\u201cN\u00e9gritude\u201d. The message being, ultimately and\nmaybe not so paradoxically, that one does not have to be black to be a\n\u201cn\u00e8gre\u201d.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Apostel, L., 1981, <em>African Philosophy: Myth or Reality?</em>,\nGent: Story-Scientia.", "Appiah, K.A., 1992, <em>In my Father\u2019s House: Africa in the\nPhilosophy of Culture</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "Bergson, H., 1932 [1977], <em>The Two Sources of Morality and\nReligion</em>, Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press\nEdition.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1944, <em>Creative Evolution</em>, New\nYork: Random House.", "Bernab\u00e9, J., Chamoiseau, P., and Confiant, R., 1990,\n<em>Eloge de la cr\u00e9olit\u00e9, In Praise of Creoleness</em>,\nParis: Gallimard.", "C\u00e9saire, A., 1946, <em>Les armes miraculeuses</em>, Paris:\nGallimard.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1956, \u201cCulture et\ncolonisation\u201d, in <em>Pr\u00e9sence Africaine</em>, VIII, IX,\nX, September-Novembre, Paris. 190\u2013205.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1991, <em>Lyric and Dramatic Poetry</em>\n<em>1946\u201382</em>, Charlottesville: The University Press of\nVirginia.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000a, <em>Notebook of a return to my\nNative Land</em>, Columbus, OH: The Ohio State University Press,\n2<sup>nd</sup> edition.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000b, <em>Discourse on colonialism</em>,\ntrans.
