    "main_text": "Alexander of Aphrodisias\n5. Alexander of Aphrodisias\n\nIn commenting on the notion of contingency in Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics, Alexander introduces the idea of stochastic\ntechn\u00ea \u2014 an idea important for the Stoic\nexplanation of virtue that we have just seen. Aristotle himself\nrecognizes a kind of knowledge that deals with things that happen for\nthe most part; what happens for the most part is distinct from what\nmay or may not happen (Prior Analytics, 32b5\u201320). In\nhis commentary on the kind of syllogism relative to what happens for\nthe most part, Alexander calls the technai that use this kind\nof syllogism stochastic. The root sense of \u2018stochastic\u2019 is\nthe ability to aim or hit. Obviously there is an ambiguity in the\nnotion. A necessary condition of being able reliably to hit the target\nis being able to aim; but aiming and hitting are different. If one\naims well, she usually hits, but contingencies can intervene.\nStochastic technai are ones subject to this kind of\ncontingency. Alexander calls them stochastic, in the sense of\nconjectural (In An.Pr. 39, 15\u201340, 5). When the\nphysician, e.g., aims at health, his aiming is a kind of conjecture,\nalbeit a grounded one, that such and such treatment will produce\nhealth.\n\nAlexander develops the notion of stochastic techn\u00ea\nfurther in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Topics.\nAddressing the problem that dialectic does not always achieve its\ngoal, i.e., leading the interlocutor to a contradiction, he divides\ntechnai into ones which achieve their ends by definite steps\nand those which cannot (In Top. 32,10\u201334,1). Given\nmaterials, tools, and other conditions, carpentry, e.g., can produce\nhouses by following a series of steps each of which is effective in a\ndeterminate way. However, medicine does not always cure and certainly\ndoes not cure with the reliability that carpentry produces houses.\nEven though medicine tries everything in its power, chance can\nintervene so that it does not achieve its goal, the curing of the\npatient. When carpentry, by contrast, tries everything in its power,\nit achieves its goal. If there is failure, it is the result not of\nchance but of error in executing the techn\u00ea, as\nAlexander says in Quaestiones (Quaestio 2.16,\n10\u201325). To mark the difference between these two kinds of\ntechn\u00ea, Alexander says that the task (ergon)\nof medicine is to try everything possible to achieve its goal\n(telos); but achieving its goal is not (totally) within the\npower of medicine. He calls stochastic, then, the sorts of\ntechn\u00ea whose task is to try everything possible to\nachieve its goal, the realization of the goal being subject to\nchance.\n\nIn a different vein, Alexander makes an interesting addition to\nAristotle\u2019s distinction between epist\u00eam\u00ea\nand techn\u00ea. In his account of wisdom in Book One of the\nMetaphysics, Aristotle argues that knowledge is valued for\nits own sake. In one place, Aristotle says that what distinguishes\nexperience (empeiria) from techn\u00ea is that the\nlatter has a rational account, which explains what it does. Of course,\nthe one with experience may be more effective than the inexperienced\nperson who has only the rational account. Still, we think the\ncraftsman wiser than the empiric because of his knowledge of the\naccount (Metaphysics 981a 5\u201330). The suppressed\nconclusion is that wisdom is characterized by knowledge of causes\nquite apart from the utility of knowing the causes. Another argument\nshows that wisdom is not productive knowledge. Since wonder is the\nbeginning of philosophy, satisfying that wonder is an end in itself.\nIn fact, this kind of pursuit arose when the requirements of necessity\nand ease were satisfied (Metaphysics 982b 10\u201315). So\nwisdom is knowledge without practical utility, an end in itself.\n\nIn his commentary on the Metaphysics, Alexander interprets\nthese arguments as showing that pure knowledge is superior to action.\nBut there is a difference between the claim that there is a kind of\nknowledge which is an end in itself and the claim that pure knowledge\nis superior to action. The latter idea is a distinct development in\nthinking about the relation between knowledge and craft. This\ndevelopment rests on the notion that action implies need and it is\nbetter to be without need. So knowledge that fills no need is superior\nto action, which fills some need or other. We see this idea at work in\nthe auxiliary arguments which Alexander offers to back up or explicate\nclaims made in Aristotle\u2019s text. For instance, when Alexander\nfirst claims that Aristotle means to show that knowledge is more\nhonorable than action, he says that action aims at some end other than\nitself. As though remembering that virtuous action \u2014 unlike\nproductive action \u2014 has no end outside itself, he immediately\noffers an argument to the effect that even virtuous actions have\nreference to the passions. Divine beings, who are without passions,\nhave no need of virtue. Those who have passions need the virtues in\norder to control the passions (In Metaph. 2, 1\u201310).\nObviously, to have passions is to be in need. The contrast between the\ndivine and the human also figures in another auxiliary argument. In\npassing, Aristotle says that one might justifiably think that wisdom\nis beyond human ability because in many ways human nature is in\nslavery (Metaphysics 982b30). Alexander explicates the remark\nabout slavery by saying that humans are slaves in that they need such\nthings as health and prosperity. But what is divine is free of all\nneed (In Metaph. 17, 15\u201320).\n\nAlexander returns to this theme in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics. At the beginning of the commentary, he\nclaims that theorizing is the highest of human goods. In making out\nthis claim, Alexander points to the situation of the gods, who are\nwithout emotions and therefore do not need the moral virtues. Nor do\nthey need to deliberate. What is left is contemplating the truth. For\nthe gods, theorizing about truth is continuous and uninterrupted. Such\na state is impossible for humans in general; but some may approach it.\nBy leaving behind emotions and the human condition, one may engage in\nthe divine activity of pure theorizing. Insofar as one is engaged in\nthis activity, a human becomes like the gods. If becoming like god\n(homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4(i)) is the greatest good for\nhumans, then syllogistic, the method for theorizing, is most valuable\n(In An. Pr. 5,20 \u2013 6,10). Although expressed\nhypothetically, becoming like god is being put forth as the greatest\ngood for humans. Even if a human cannot always be in such a state,\nwhen he is in a state of continuous and uninterrupted theorizing about\nthe truth, he is just so far forth like god. In this discussion\nAlexander is building on themes found in Aristotle\u2019s\nNicomachean Ethics (X.7\u20138). There Aristotle argues that\nthe life of contemplation is happiness because it is the virtue of the\nhighest part of the soul, reason. Since this part is the most\ngod-like, contemplation is in some sense divine activity. Still, in\nthese passages, Aristotle continues to talk about integrating\ncontemplation of truth within the context of a human life. By\ncontrast, Alexander suggests that one might lead \u2014 or at least\nstrive for\u2014 a god-like life of pure contemplation. In such an\naccount, pure theory is expressly divorced from practice and promoted\nover it.\n",
