Color Names and the Development of Color Perception\n\nOne of Marty\u2019s early works (Marty 1879) is concerned with a\nproblem that differs from the ones he treats in his other writings. In\nthe work under consideration he addresses the question whether the\nusage of color names in ancient Greek literature, especially Homer,\nprovides us with reasons to assume that human color perception has\nevolved in the last couple of thousand years. Homer sometimes clearly\nuses one and the same color term for very different colors and\nsometimes describes colors of everyday objects in a way which is\nsurprisingly incompatible with our contemporary color descriptions.\nThe description of the color of the sea as \u201cwine dark\u201d and\nmany other such instances in Homer, as has had been pointed out\n(Gladstone 1858, vol. III, 457 ff.), can be taken as a strong\nindication that the ancient Greeks perceived colors in a way that\ndiffers from our color perception. Some of Marty\u2019s\ncontemporaries thought that this is not only the case (Wenning 1990),\nbut also that the evidence suggested that the evolution of color\nperception starts with dark and bright and proceeds through the color\nspectrum. This would mean that the ancient Greeks could see red and\nperhaps yellow, though probably not green, blue, and violet. On the\nbasis of the physiological work of Ewald Hering on color perception\n(Hering 1878), Marty argued that such a development could not take\nplace. For it was a result of Hering\u2019s work that the perception\nof red and green was the result of the same neural system and that of\nthe perception of blue and yellow was the result of a distinct one.\nBlindness to red consequently goes together with blindness to green,\nas does blindness to blue with blindness to yellow. Moreover, Marty\nargues from various data, most notably ancient paintings, that the\nancient Greeks perceived all the colors that we do. However, if\nancient Greeks perceived the same colors as we do, how do we explain\nthe great difference between Homer\u2019s and our usage of color\nterms? Marty gives various reasons, but two seem to be specially\nimportant. Firstly, Marty insists that the proponents of the evolution\nof color perception fail to distinguish between color sensation and\njudgments in which colors are classified. They also forget to take\ninto account that language is primarily a means for communication, not\na tool for isolated theoretical descriptions. When people feel no\nspecial need to communicate about certain colors, they feel no need to\nclassify them with special terms. One term can therefore cover a wider\narea of color sensations (Marty 1879, 97 ff., see also Funke 1924,\n14). Secondly, Marty brings the poetic function of language and its\npoetic inner form into focus (Marty 1879, 78\u201394). The main goal\nof Homer\u2019s poetry was not to communicate exact observations, but\nto evoke powerful and aesthetically pleasing presentations with the\nhelp of metaphor and metonymy. This leads to a surprising and unusual\npoetic use of color terms employed in comparisons and presentation\nthrough relations. The fact that Marty elaborates on such distinctions\nis of particular significance because it already exemplifies how\nBrentanian descriptive psychology was being applied in his early work.\nThis was of course to be done more elaborately and systematically in\nhis later writings, especially his main work (Marty 1908a).\n",
