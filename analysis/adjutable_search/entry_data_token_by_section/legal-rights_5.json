    "main_text": "What Rights Are: Form || Rights \u201cIn Personam\u201d and Rights \u201cIn Rem\u201d\n3.4 Rights \u201cIn Personam\u201d and Rights \u201cIn Rem\u201d\n\nClaims, privileges, powers, and immunities can manifest as either\nrights in personam or in rem. Rights in\npersonam are rights the content of which designates a specific\nand definite right-object. These rights are typically associated with\nthe law of obligations (contracts, trusts, and parts of torts),\nwherein rights are expressly held against a specific person or\npersons, such as a promisor, trustee, or tortfeasor. \n\nIn contrast, the content of rights in rem explicitly\ndesignates a \u201cthing\u201d that one holds the right over, not\nagainst whom specifically that right is held. Accordingly, such rights\nare not held against a definitive individual(s), but against an\nindefinite set of right-objects. If you will, rights in rem\nare held against every eligible individual yet, against no one\nspecifically (Hohfeld 1919: 68\u2013114; Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966:\n235\u2013237). Thus, rights in rem are describable as\nnormative relations between right-holders and everyone else (as\nindividuals, not a group) in relation to a certain\n\u201cthing\u201d (Ross 1953: 230\u2013231). Most commonly, rights\nin rem are associated with property law, such as one\u2019s\nrights to possess or to reasonably use and enjoy one\u2019s land,\nwhich is held against every person (Radin 1938: 1155\u20131156;\nKramer 1998: 10 f2). Yet, the \u201cthings\u201d over which rights\nin rem are held include not only property (real, personal, or\nintellectual), but also, for example, other rights, the integrity of\none\u2019s person, emotions, and reputation (Hohfeld 1919:\n85\u201386; Fitzgerald [Salmond] 1966: 224). \n\nThe distinction between these two types of rights tracks a difference\ntypical to their respective moral roles. Namely, rights in\npersonam seem designed to give legal effect to significant\nrelationships between specific individuals, while rights in\nrem are typically oriented towards the value that exclusive\naccess, control over, security in, integrity of (etc.) certain\n\u201cthings\u201d have for right-holders (Fitzgerald [Salmond]\n1966: 237\u2013238). Moreover, given the association between the two\ntypes of right with different branches of law, the distinction between\nrights in rem and rights in personam emphasizes an\naffinity between those legal branches and the two different moral\nroles of each type of right. That is, much of the law of obligations\nin about obligations between specific individuals, while property law\nis focused more on securing the affinity between individuals and\ncertain \u201cthings\u201d. \n\nFinally, the way rights in rem and rights in\npersonam are deployed impacts the measure of freedom allowed in a\nlegal system. Broadly speaking, negative claim-rights are more\nconducive to the personal liberty of right-objects than positive\nduties. Negative claim-rights forbid a set of actions, leaving all\nother options open. In contrast, positive claim-rights require certain\nactions, thereby forbidding all other incompatible options.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, legal system that prize personal liberty\ntend to adopt in rem negative claim-rights (e.g., the tort\nright against interference with contract) and in personam\npositive claim-rights (e.g., a contractual right to receive a\nservice). There are, of course, exception to this rule of thumb, such\nas the in rem positive claim-right to a rescue found in\nGood Samaritan laws (Jones 1994: 15\u201316). \n",
