    "main_text": "Bacon\u2019s early work on Grammar and Logic || Summa grammatica\n3.1 Summa grammatica\n\nIn this work, Bacon draws directly from the commentary on Priscian\n(Priscianus minor) by Robert Kilwardby. This is representative\nof early speculative grammar as it developed in Paris during the first\nhalf of the thirteenth century. Bacon\u2019s approach to grammar and\nlogic has a connection with the logic of that of William of\nSherwood..\n\nPart one of the Summa Grammatica sets out the rules governing\nboth common constructions with subject and verb and rules governing\nfigurative constructions. The latter include specific accounts of the\nfive figures of construction: antithesis, synthesis, prolepsis,\nsyllepsis, and zeugma. This is borrowed from Kilwardby\n(Institutiones grammaticae, xvii, 153). In part two, Bacon\nanalyzes the more difficult non-figurative constructions such as\nimpersonals, gerundives, ablative absolutes, interjections. In a third\npart, he examines sophisms in terms of their subject-matter and ranges\nfrom a cursory treatment to more extended treatments typical of a\ndisputed question. In the last section, there is a cursory analysis of\nsome short sentences including adverbial constructions [lupus est\nin fabula] and some liturgical formulae [patris et filii et\nspiritus sancti, ita missa est]. The latter are problematic due to\ntheir elliptical character. An account of Bacon\u2019s intellectual\nrelationship to Robert Kilwardby can be found in Ir\u00e8ne Rosier\n(1994).\n\nAs noted above, a major feature of this treatment of speculative\ngrammar is the fact that the reasoning is closely linked to the\nPhysics of Aristotle (Rosier\n 1994).[2]\n This reasoned grammar is based on the belief that \u201cart imitates\nnature to the extent that it can\u201d (Physics II, 219 4a\n21). Borrowing from Aristotle and Averroes and influenced by Robert\nKilwardby, Bacon exploits the distinction between the permanent and\nthe successive as the ground of the grammatical distinction between\nthe noun/pronoun and the verb/adverb. He applies this to the\ndefinition of grammatical category.\n\nAs Ir\u00e8ne Rosier-Catach has noted, \u201cThe construction of\nwords is conceived as a movement. The verb, the pivot of the sentence,\nsignifies action and movement and needs for that reason two terms, a\nterminus a quo or principium and a terminus ad\nquem or terminus (Summa Grammatica 66, 78). On one\nlevel, physical conceptualization is used to re-define certain\nnotions. Cases are properties allowing an expression to function as a\nterm of movement (Summa Grammatica 34); in this way, the\naccusative expresses the terminus ad quem. At a second level,\nBacon\u2019s conceptualization allows him to state some very general\nrules for the combination of categories\u201d (Rosier-Catach 1997,\n70).\n\nFor example, Bacon argues that both the participle and the infinitive\nby means of their verbal signification are not sufficiently stable to\nbe a terminus of motion. This is based on the premise that\n\u201cnothing which is in motion can come to rest in something in\nmotion, no motion being able to complete itself in something in\nmotion.\u201d And, using the principle that \u201cthe action is in\nthe patient as in a subject,\u201d he tackles the issue of\ngrammatical agreement. Further, the central principle for the\norganization of terms is the notion of dependence\n(dependencia). Hence, the relation of natural dependence\nbetween the accident and the subject is reflected in the construction\nof the adjective with its substantive.\n\nGrammatical reasoning, then, finds itself wedged between physical and\nlogical reasoning. This can be seen in the analysis of the expression,\nest dies. Why one term and not two? What is the function of\ndies? In an analysis of motion there are two terms. But in\nreason, one can see that the one term has two functions that are\nnecessarily present in every assertion. And whereas Logic requires\nthat the subject be different from the predicate, Grammar as a\npositive science depends on the intellect and will. \n\nThe most significant aspect of Bacon\u2019s grammatical analysis is\none that will be replicated in his later work on semiotics. This is\nhis intentionalist analysis. The reasons connected to\ngrammatical analysis cannot be discovered or applied mechanically:\nthey are dependent on the signifying intention of the speaker\n(intentio proferentis). This kind of analysis is found in\nRobert Kilwardby and in many similar texts on sophisms. As\nRosier-Catach puts it, \u201cThe correctness of a statement does not\ndepend solely on its conformity with the rules of grammar but\nequally on its adequateness with its signifying intention. Sometimes\nindeed, because the speaker wishes to signify some precise\nidea, he may legitimately distance himself from the normal\nrules\u201d (Rosier-Catach 1997, 73). Still, this freedom is not\nabsolute; it must be justified linguistically. Even elliptical\nexpressions such as ita missa est have within them the\ncapacity to allow further application of formulas such as cantata,\ndicta, etc. Thus, to quote Rosier, \u201cThe rule-governed\nnature of language-functions is to be found not only in the common\nusage but also in those \u2018authorized\u2019 variations. It is\nprecisely this principle that Bacon will put to work at the semantic\nlevel when he conducts his analysis of Signs [c. 1267].\nBeyond the ordinary usage of the sign, derivable from its institution,\nthe speaker always has the liberty to use it in the\ntranslated way, the variation being in the majority of cases\nexplainable and for this reason comprehensible by the listener. In\nother words, language is for man an instrument, a means. This\nvoluntarist/instrumental conception is to be seen likewise in the\ncontext of Bacon\u2019s treatment of the magical power of\nwords\u201d (Rosier-Catach 1997, 73\u201374).\n\nThis imporant aspect of \u201cthe magical power of words\u201d has\nagain been examined carefully in terms of language study as it relates\nto the uses of logic in theology by Rosier-Catach (2004). Graziella\nFederici Vescovini (2011) has now presented a magisterial study of the\nclose connection of philosophy and natural magic in the Middle Ages,\naccentuating the notion of \u201cthe magical power of words\u201d in\nrelation to Bacon and other medieval philosophers. This magical power\nof words, derived from Alkindi, has a connection with Bacon\u2019s\ntheory of communication in part five of the Moralis\nphilosophia.\n\nBacon\u2019s Logic (1240s):\n\n\nSumma de sophismatibus et distinctionibus (SSD)\nSummula super totam logicam (= Sumulae\ndialectices) (SD)\n\n\n\nThe late Jan Pinborg has described the terminist logic found in Bacon\nand his contemporaries as \u201csemantical analysis of a natural\nlanguage, viz. Latin, built on Aristotelian logic, especially the\nSophistici elenchi and the Peri hermeneias, and on\nthe development of grammar. This analysis stressed the truth value of\npropositions analyzed and its conditions, and therefore displayed what\ncan be called a contextual approach; that is, it was based on\nthe actual function and reference of the term in the proposition to be\nanalyzed. A given word could be used differently, or according to\ndifferent suppositions, and the rules for these different\nuses helped to avoid ambiguities. The doctrine of supposition was\nintended to solve both the relatively trivial ambiguities which arose\nfrom confusion of linguistic levels (man is white, man is a species,\nman is a noun) and ambiguities involved in quantification (or\ndistribution) theory. These problems were primarily solved in terms of\nreference, since different suppositiones picked out different\nranges of individuals.\u201d(Jan Pinborg 1979)\n\nOne can see therefore why Bacon, through his concern with the central\nrole of applied logic in guarding against ambiguity, saw the analysis\nof equivocation as central to the analysis of language. Against the\ngrowing Modist tendency to understand parts of grammar as indicative\nof the objective constituents of things in the world, Bacon stresses\nthe importance of equivocation analysis. Since the imposition of\nnames, the constant change in language use, and especially the ongoing\nimplicit shift of meaning in language are all important for a theory\nof meaning, Bacon demands contextual language analysis. Here, one\nmight speak of Bacon\u2019s \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to\nlanguage theory.\n",
