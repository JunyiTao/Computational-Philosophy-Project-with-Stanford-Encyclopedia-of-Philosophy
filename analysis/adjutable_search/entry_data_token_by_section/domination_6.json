    "main_text": "What Kind of Power Is Domination?\n4. What Kind of Power Is Domination?\n\nExercised or unexercised, what kind of power is domination? If\ndomination is about how social relationships are structured, what is\nA in a position to do if A dominates B? If\ndomination requires the exercise of power, how does A use their\npower when they dominate B?\n\nAlong one dimension, we can sort answers to these questions into the\nmoralized vs. the non-moralized. For a moralized\ntheory, identifying domination requires us to settle more foundational\nquestions about what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust. For\nexample, if we say that dominating power is the power to violate human\nrights, our theory of domination depends on a theory of human\nrights\u2014obviously a moral theory. Non-moralized theories hold\nthat we can identify domination without reference to theories of the\nright or the good. For example, if we say that dominating power is\npower over the means of production, our theory of domination will\ndepend on a [plausibly] descriptive theory of what counts as the means\nof production. \n\nOf course, those who insist that domination can be defined without\nmaking moral judgments aren\u2019t usually committed to what Ian\nCarter calls \u201cvalue-independence\u201d about the phenomenon, or\n\u201cthe complete detachment of our analysis from all ethical\nconcerns\u201d (2015: 280\u2013281). Contributions to the contemporary discussion of\ndomination from all-comers are generally motivated by profound ethical\nconcerns.\n\nSorting is also required along another dimension. In addition to\nquestions of moralization or non-moralization, there is the question\nof how domination relates to the use of power to dictate norms and\nrules, or the use of power to claim authority. Is domination always an\nattempt to rule? Does domination always involve a claim\u2014however\nmistaken\u2014by dominators that their power is legitimate? Does\ndomination always involve an attempt by the powerful to demand that\nthe dominated conform to norms? If you answer any of these questions\nin the affirmative, you advocate a norm-dependent theory of\ndomination.\n\nConfusion is easy here, given that moralized theories often appeal to\nnorms and rules. The difference between such moralized theories and\nnon-moralized but norm-dependent theories depends on the difference\nbetween correct moral norms/rules as distinguished from just\nany norm or rule. Norm-dependent theories say that domination always\ninvolves power exercised through norms and rules that some regard as\nlegitimate\u2014perhaps the dominator, perhaps the dominated, or\nperhaps both. As we will see, for theories that are not just\nnorm-dependent but also moralized, domination always involves\na failure to respect the moral status of agents as sources of the\nnorms that govern them. For a merely norm-dependent theory, the\ndomination of a patriarch might be essentially connected to the\npatriarch\u2019s claim that he deserves obedience from his family.\nObviously, whether or not someone claims or doesn\u2019t claim to\ndeserve obedience is a merely descriptive matter; as a result, such a\ntheory is not moralized. The legitimacy of the patriarch\u2019s\nauthority is merely sociological, not moral. If a theory of domination\nsays instead that the patriarch dominates because his demand for\nobedience unjustly undermines the right of his spouse and children to\nshape the norms that govern them, that theory is both norm-dependent\nand moralized. A theory that depends in part on an account of\nunjust infringements is clearly moralized.\n\nIt is not always easy to sort theories into these categories. The\nsorting is complicated by the fact that whether a theory is moralized\nor norm-dependent is sometimes a matter of active controversy. (This\nis particularly true of Pettit\u2019s theory of domination.) In what\nfollows, theories will be sorted to reflect the intentions of the\ntheorist\u2014at least as far as these intentions can be\ndiscerned.\n\nOnce we recognize the distinction between moralization and\nnorm-dependency, we end up with four kinds of answer to the question\n\u201cWhat kind of power is domination?\u201d Assuming for now that\nonly agents (represented here by A and B) can dominate\nor be dominated:\n\n\n\nNorm-Independent\nNorm-Dependent\n\nNon-Moralized\nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises\nuncontrolled power over what B is in a position to do. \nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises\nsociologically legitimate power over what B is in a position to\ndo.  \n\nMoralized\nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises power\nover what B is in a position to do by violating\nB\u2019s rights or undermining B\u2019s interests with\nimpunity. \nIf A dominates B, A has or exercises power over\nwhat B is in a position to do that is both sociologically\nlegitimate and unconstrained by institutions designed to protect\nB\u2019s rights and interests. \n\n\nThis section will examine theories from each division, with their\nbasic motivations and primary exemplars. \n",
