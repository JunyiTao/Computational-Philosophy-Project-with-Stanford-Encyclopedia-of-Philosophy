    "main_text": "Feminist Contributions to Thematic Areas || Disability and other non-standard embodiments\n5.3 Disability and other non-standard embodiments\n\nBiomedicine\u2019s view of the female body as a troublesome deviation\nfrom a standard male norm has rarely been questioned by mainstream\nscholars. Not surprisingly, feminist bioethics has taken a more\nskeptical approach to the categorization of normal and abnormal\nbodies, and has developed a rich exploration of what it means\nbioethically to have or to be a \u201cnon-standard\u201d body,\nwhether by virtue of sex, gender, age, race, class, or disability.\nEngaging with the work of disability scholars, for example, feminist\nbioethicists have critically examined the way the impaired body is\nconstrued. They have gone beyond some well-trodden bioethical issues\nin the regulation of technologies to prevent, cure, or ameliorate\ndisability, producing a body of theoretical work on, for example, the\nsocial and cultural expectations of normality and the norms of\ndependency and vulnerability (Fine & Asch 1988; Kittay 1999; Wong\n2002; Tremain 2005; Scully 2008, 2014; Hall 2011; Ho 2011; Reynolds\n& Silvers 2017).\n\nOther feminist bioethicists have reflected on the more general\nclassification of non-standard embodiments as pathologies, and the\nquestions of autonomy and choice that such medicalization raises\n(Purdy 2001, 2006; Garry 2001; Zeiler & K\u00e4ll 2014). The\npathologization of the obese body and fat stigma have been extensively\ndiscussed (Reiheld 2015, 2020; Guidry-Grimes & Victor 2012;\nStrings 2015; MacKay 2017). There is also a growing body of work on\nrelated issues concerning transgendered (Draper & Evans 2006;\nNelson 2016) and intersex embodiment (Holmes 2008; Feder 2014); see\nalso below.\n",
