    "main_text": "Libertarianism, Left and Right\n4. Libertarianism, Left and Right\n\nThere are two active ways in which libertarianism is self-consciously\ndeployed as a left-wing as opposed to a right-wing philosophy. There\nis a left/right paradigm in the broader history of libertarian thought\nthat hinges on whether or not, broadly speaking, it is deployed as a\nradical project or a reactionary one. The other is narrowly within the\ndebate over distributive justice, and hinges on principles concerning\nownership of external resources that are posited alongside\nself-ownership.\n\nWithin the first paradigm, left-libertarianism1 refers to\nan approach that takes its cue largely from the American individualist\nanarchism of figures such as Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, and\nLysander Spooner, and to a lesser extent, early radical French\nliberalism of Jean-Baptiste Say, Charles Comte, and Charles Dunoyer.\nThe chief contemporary advocates of left-libertarianism1\nare Gary Chartier and Roderick Long.\n\nLeft-libertarianism1 typically maintains the familiar\nnormative and deontological commitment to justice as constituted by\nstrong rights of all individuals to freedom of action, social\nassociation, and economic cooperation (understood as rights of\nproperty and contract). However, it couples that normative framework\nwith a set of descriptive commitments. Namely, it holds close to a\nclass-based view of political sociology developed by radical liberals\nsuch as Say, Comte, and Dunoyer (see Weinburg 1978, Hart 1990) as well\nas Franz Oppenheimer (1914, also see Rothbard 2009) that places the\nstate within a class-based analysis of human history. Coupled together\nthese commitments generate a radical critique of the state as the\nchief vehicle of plutocracy, and myriad other forms of domination that\nmake people unfree.\n\nLeft-libertarians1 regard the state as inherently unjust in\nvirtue of not being consented to (Tucker 1893, Spooner 1870, 1882,\n1886, Long 1995, Chartier 2011b, 2012). The state is also regarded as\ninstrumentally dangerous in that its monopoly on the use of force\nmakes it the play-thing of groups that seek to dominate and exploit\nother groups (Long 2008c, 2012 [Other Internet Resources], Chartier\n2011b). It does not regard the state as a mere epiphenomenon of\nplutocratic power, but rather as empirically instrumental to\nplutocratic power.\n\nModern advocates of left-libertarianism1 regard state\ncoercion as being both constitutively related to broader forms of\ndomination and instrumentally related to them (Christmas 2016).\nCrucially, left-libertarians1 typically regard the economic\nconditions of actually-existing capitalism as being largely an effect\nof state interventions on behalf of incumbent capitalist interests\n(Chartier & Johnson 2011). Some argue that a market freed of state\ninterference would be one in which there were more, smaller, more\ncooperatively organised, productive units, and in which inequality of\nincome would be lower. Some argue more strongly that it would be\nindistinguishable from anarchist socialism. For this reason, most\nleft-libertarians1 describe their position as\n\u201canti-capitalist\u201d. They maintain a strong distinction\nbetween a free market based political economy and\ncapitalist political economy where the latter involves either\nstate-capital partnership or capitalist domination of society, or both\n(Chartier 2011a, Long, 2008a). Some argue for these conclusions based\non the \u201ccost-principle\u201d of classical political economy\nthat said where there is a lack of monopoly, prices would tend toward\ncost, making cooperative enterprise the most efficient productive\nmodel (Carson 2007, 2008). Others argue for similar conclusions from\nmodern, marginalist economic theory (Long 2008a). Central to both\nanalyses is that monopoly power is responsible for aberrations from a\nmore egalitarian market equilibrium. And that monopoly power is, in\nturn, enabled by the state \u2013 the monopoliser of coercion itself,\nwhich is the chief enabler of all other monopolies (Tucker 1888).\n\nWhilst it may have been reasonable for the early American\nindividualist anarchists to believe that market forces were an\negalitarian, equilibrating force given the level of development around\nthem, critics of left-libertarianism1 argue that it ignores\nimportant developments in economic conditions (see Anderson 2017)\nsince then. Others argue that this view of market forces ignores\ndevelopments in economic theory since then, in particular, that it is\ngrounded in a fallacious labour theory of value (Rothbard 1965 [2000],\nMurphy 2006).\n\nLeft-libertarians1 also argue that libertarian commitment\nto justice sit coherently alongside egalitarian commitments outside of\nthe narrow scope of justice. Whilst individual rights to maximal\nfreedom of action, association, and economic cooperation describe the\nmoral limits to the interpersonal use of force, there is much morality\nof social and political interest that lies beyond justice but which is\nnot entirely separable from justice (Johnson 2008, Christmas 2017).\nOpposition to sexism (Long & Johnson 2004), racism, nationalism,\net al, are often taken to be part of a full package of human\nemancipation. Whilst these commitments are not logically deduced from\na commitment to libertarian justice, they are grounded in similar\nfirst-order intuitions regarding egalitarian individualism (Christmas\n2019). Critics of this aspect of the view argue that the libertarian\nview on justice derives part of its value from its transcendence of,\nand compatibility with, a variety of other views about the good (Block\n2010).\n\nThis paradigm of left-libertarianism1 is distinguished from\na right-libertarianism1, that, whilst radical in a sense of\nbeing strongly demanding upon the status quo, regards fewer aspects of\nthe status quo as a normative problem.\nRight-libertarianism1 takes the structure of\nactually-existing capitalism to be a closer proxy of what a free\nmarket would look like. Right-libertarianism1 may also be\ntaken to be part of a thicker bundle of moral and social commitments,\nbut not ones associated with individual emancipation beyond the narrow\nscope of libertarian justice. On this view it is allied with social\nconservatism favouring cultural homogeneity/segregation, patriarchy,\nand inequality (so long as these things can be sustained voluntarily,\nand therefore in a way consistent with libertarian rights for all)\n(Feser 2010, Hoppe 2018).\n\nA figure in whom these dual tendencies of libertarianism can be viewed\nto play out is Murray Rothbard. An economist who also wrote\nextensively in history and philosophy, who swung between these radical\nand reactionary tendencies over his lifetime (see Massimino 2020). For\nlibertarianism to be fully understood it must be taken seriously in\nboth its radical leftist and its reactionary right-wing forms, as well\nas when it combines aspects of both tendencies (Tomasi & Zwolinski\n2023).\n\nNarrowly within the scope of distributive justice, libertarianism is\ndescribed as being left- or right-wing depending on whether it demands\nan egalitarian pattern of property rights in external resources. Both\nleft- and right-libertarians2 within this paradigm agree on\nself-ownership. The question arises over what constraints (if any)\nexist on what external resources self-owners can appropriate.\nLeft-libertarians2 countenance a principle demanding that\nexternal resources be equally distributed among self-owners, whereas\nright-libertarians2 do not. Though there is variance on the\nkinds of constraints right-libertarians2 place on\nacquisition, none of them demand equal holdings.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum sits the maximally permissive view of\noriginal appropriation. This view holds that that there are no\nquantitative constraints on the appropriation of unowned and unused\nresources. (Rothbard 1978, 1982, Narveson 1988, ch. 7, 1999, Feser\n 2005, Christmas 2020)\n Whilst there are particular procedures through which one must acquire\ninitially unowned (for example, making ostensive use of the resource\nin question), there is no limit on how much property this procedure\ncan be used to acquire. The initial non-ownership of the external\nworld drives this view.\n\nMost libertarians accept something like the so-called Lockean\nproviso. This proviso holds that appropriation is permissible if\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d be left for others. There\u2019s an\nextensive debate over how exactly this proviso is to be understood.\nNozick interprets the proviso to require that no individual be made\nworse off by a particular appropriation of a natural resource. But\nthis interpretation is problematic for at least two reasons. First,\nsuch a welfare-based constraint on the exercise of people\u2019s\nnatural right to appropriate seems ill-motivated within Nozick\u2019s\ntheory. In general, the exercise of our rights is not usually\nconstrained by a non-worsening requirement. Second, Nozick\u2019s\nproviso is vulnerable to the objection that, as long as property\nowners compensate non-owners only slightly over the pre-appropriation\nbaseline (which is likely quite low), non-owners are not wronged\n(Cohen 1995). This seems to permit what intuitively seems like a\nproblematically unequal outcome in which one person could appropriate\nall property, so long as they compensate everyone else by a tiny\namount. On such a view, private property seems to only function to\nproduce welfare rather than giving each individual a sphere of\nindependence.\n\nOthers interpret the Lockean proviso as requiring something like a\nsufficientarian requirement, such that people must have access to an\nadequate share of natural resources (Lomasky 1987; Wendt 2017). This\nview might invoke differing conceptions of adequacy, such as\nwell-being or the ability to be self-governing (Simmons 1992, 1993).\nOr one might see the proviso as ensuring the ability to exercise\none\u2019s rights of self-ownership. (Mack 1995) Or one might see is\nas grounding the right of necessity that has been a core part\nof the general natural rights tradition from Thomas Aquinas to Hugo\nGrotius (Christmas 2021c, pp. 51\u201354) These views converge\nclosely with the no-proviso view in that they articulate the inherent\nrestrictions within the power of acquisition which is grounded in our\noriginal rights. Nozick does not explain how the power of acquisition\nis grounded in our original rights, and hence posits the proviso as an\nexternal principle so that the power of acquisition is not entirely\nuntethered.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, left-libertarians2 argue\nthat the external world is not initially unowned in the sense\npresupposed above but is owned in some egalitarian manner. Therefore,\nany private acquisition of it is strongly constrained in some\negalitarian way.\n\nOne version of this view leans on the equal freedom principle of Kant\nand Spencer (see Steiner 1974). The argument is that self-ownership\ndepends upon some amount of world-ownership. If we do not have the\nright to locate our body at some location in space over time, we have\nno right to exist and therefore cannot be said to be self-owners\n(Steiner 2009, p. 241, also see Spencer 1851, ch. 9). The mere\nconceptual possibility of one person coming to own all the land is\nincoherent alongside the principle of universal self-ownership. Since\nwe must all equally be self-owners as far as is conceptually possible,\nand ownership of natural resources is essential to our being\nself-owners, to truly be self-owners we must all equally own the\nexternal world. This does not mean private appropriation cannot take\nplace, but it does mean that all private appropriations are encumbered\nwith a tax liability to compensate all others who may have privately\nappropriated less than you. Viewed this way,\nleft-libertarianism2 therefore intimately connects a\nuniversal basic income to self-ownership and freedom (Steiner\n2016).\n\nAn alternative version of the argument is leans more closely on the\nlabour-based justification of property found in Locke and others. The\nargument is that whilst all self-owners own their labor, and are\ntherefore entitled to recoup the full fruits thereof, the external,\nnatural world is not the result of anyone\u2019s labor. Therefore,\nwhen we produce objects of value by laboring upon natural resources,\nwe can only claim a portion of the value it has, namely, the portion\ncontributed by our own labor. The only person that can be said to be\nentitled the natural value found in nature is all of humanity.\nTherefore, all owners of private property must pay a tax against the\nvalue of the natural resources they own to compensate those who are\nexcluded from it, whilst still being able to recoup the value they\nadd. Viewed this way, left-libertarianism2 intimately\nconnects land-value taxation to self-ownership and freedom, and as\nsuch continues the legacy of Henry George (1897). This view is,\nhowever, subject the critiques of labor-mixing views of property and\nof the labor theory of value, noted above.\n\nThe debates one finds within luck-egalitarian approaches to\ndistributive justice over the nature of luck- and\nresponsibility-sensitivity, the measurement of freedom and of welfare,\nenter left-libertarian2 debates over the Lockean proviso.\nFor example, Michael Otsuka proposes a welfarist rather than a\nvalue-based metric of equality of ownership (2003).\n\nAs an exegetical interpretation of Locke\u2019s requirement that\nappropriators leave \u201cenough and as good\u201d, however,\nleft-libertarian2 views are implausible. In his discussion\nof appropriation, Locke invokes the idea of distributive shares only\nthree times (sections 31, 37, and 46). All appear in the context of\nthe (quite different) prohibition on letting things spoil. In these\ncases, and in these cases alone, Locke sees appropriation as taking\nwhat belongs to other particular people.\n\nLeft-libertarians2 often claim intuitive support for an\negalitarian proviso. When multiple people are presented with a\npreviously undivided resource, equal division is the intuitively fair\napproach. An objection, however, is that such intuitions apply only to\ncircumstances that ignore relevant conditions. For instance, while\nOtsuka (2018) is correct to claim that if two persons are stranded\ntogether on an island, equal division is the intuitive solution, this\nmay not be true if one person arrived earlier and had already\ncultivated, say, two-thirds of the island, while leaving more than\nenough for the second person to independently make a living, is\nwilling to cooperate, trade, and so on. In that case, the latecomer\ninsisting that she has a right to half the island is not only\ncounter-intuitive, but probably unjust. The intuition of equal\ndivision becomes even less appealing if we imagine more than two\nparties, capable of production, trade, and cooperation, arriving at\ndifferent times. It remains true, of course, that such latecomers will\nbe entitled to something like an equally good shot at making use of\nthe world\u2019s resources. What such an equally good shot comes to,\nhowever, is much less clear. Others argue that the respective\nintuitions behind egalitarian ownership of the world and individual\nself-ownership are strictly incoherent (Risse 2004).\n",
