    "main_text": "Early Theories of Consequence || Precursors\n2.1 Precursors\n\nOne of the most important ancient sources for the development of\ntheories of consequence by medieval authors is, unsurprisingly,\nAristotle. The Prior Analytics and the theory of syllogistic\nprovided the main model for the correctness/validity of arguments for\ncenturies, and even though theories of consequences can be seen as a\ngeneralization of the rather narrow theory of validity presented in\nthe Prior Analytics, it is clear that syllogistic remains one\nof the key elements in the background. Indeed, the famous definition\nof a valid deduction (syllogism) at the beginning of the Prior\nAnalytics is already a formulation of the necessary\ntruth-preservation criterion (TP):\n\nA deduction is a discourse in which, certain things being stated,\nsomething other than what is stated follows of necessity from their\nbeing so. (24b19\u201320)\n\n\nRetracing the historical sources for the development of this notion\nwould take us too far afield, but it seems that the emergence of the\nidea of \u2018following of necessity\u2019 is closely related to dialectical practices of debates (Dutilh Novaes 2021), both in philosophy/logic (Casteln\u00e9rac and Marion 2009) and in mathematics (Netz 1999). But while it is a\nnecessary condition, necessary truth-preservation is notoriously not a\nsufficient condition for syllogistic validity. For example, as is well\nknown, Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic does not validate the principle of\nreflexivity, i.e., \u2018A implies A\u2019 for any sentence A, even\nthough this principle is the most transparent occurrence of necessary\ntruth-preservation one can think of. Instead, it seems that\nsyllogistic validity requires a great deal more to hold (Thom 2010) (Thom 2016).\nInterestingly, Aristotle himself suggests that the premises in a\nsyllogism are the material causes for the conclusion\n(Metaphysics 1013b19\u201320; Physics 195a18\u201319),\n\u201cin the sense of \u2018that from which\u2019\u201d, thus\nsomewhat in the spirit of the idea of premises containing the\nconclusion expressed in (Co), and more generally the idea that the antecedent is the cause of the consequent (which would become widespread in the 13th century (Spruyt 2018)). Indeed, it has been claimed that\n\nAncient logics were all in some sense relevance logics. They insisted\nthat for an argument to be valid, conditions must be met that\nguaranteed both that it would be impossible for the premises to be\ntrue and the conclusion false and that there would be connections of\nvarious kinds between the premises and conclusions. (Normore 1993,\n448)\n\n\nIndeed, besides variations of (TP) and (ST), criteria of causation, relevance and containment also appear frequently in the writings of medieval authors.\n\nThe extent to which (ST) is present in the Prior Analytics is\nalso a moot point (Thom 2010) (Dutilh Novaes 2021). Aristotle does not apply the concepts\nof form and matter anywhere in his logical writings, but his\nconsistent use of schematic letters and many of his argumentative\nstrategies in this work suggest that he relies on something resembling\nwhat we now refer to as the \u2018logical form\u2019 of arguments.\nWhat is not clear is whether Aristotle relies on (ST) merely as a\nconvenient technical device to capture the more fundamental property\nof necessary truth-preservation, or whether for him (TP) and (ST) are\nindependent core components of the concept of a syllogism/deduction\n(or perhaps even that (TP) is to be reduced to (ST)).\n\nThe Prior Analytics is not the only Aristotelian text\nproviding the historical background for the development of the notion\nof consequence. Equally important is one of his (presumably)\n\u2018older\u2019 logical texts, the Topics; this text,\nwhich even more explicitly than the Analytics clearly presupposes a dialectical\nbackground, presents various considerations on how to\nargue well in dialectical encounters (see the\nentry on ancient logic of this encyclopedia, section 2.1). By discussing which moves are allowed in a debate, it naturally ends up addressing the general idea of \u2018what follows from\nwhat\u2019 (Dutilh Novaes 2021). As we will see, the Topics became an important\nstarting point for discussions on the validity of arguments; the\ntheory of syllogistic only covers a rather limited range of arguments\n(two-premised arguments containing only the four kinds of categorical\nsentences), and the framework of the Topics was often called\nupon to fill in the gap between what syllogistic had to offer and the\nmuch larger range of putatively valid arguments one might be\ninterested in (Klima 2016).\n\nTwo other ancient traditions which may have contributed to the\ndevelopment of medieval theories of consequence are the Stoic\ntradition (see the entry on ancient logic of this encyclopedia,\nsection 5) and the tradition of the ancient commentators (Barnes 1990,\n2008; entry on the ancient commentators of this encyclopedia). But in\nfact, while a Stoic connection is prima facie plausible \u2014 unlike\nAristotelian term-based logic, Stoic logic is also largely\nsentence-based \u2014 historical evidence for direct Stoic influence\nremains elusive; for now, no record of actual channels of influence\nhas been\n identified.[4]\n The ancient commentators, by contrast, had significant (both indirect\nand direct) impact on the development of the notion of consequence\n\u2014 at first via Boethius, later via the Arabic authors, and as\ntheir commentaries were translated and read by the Latin authors in\nthe 13th century and onwards.\n\nWhile the notion of necessary truth-preservation was already quite\nmature in the Prior Analytics, the conceptual development of\nthe substitutivity criterion is essentially a later contribution of\nthe ancient commentators (Barnes 1990, 2008; Dutilh Novaes 2012a).\nRecall that Aristotle had not applied the metaphysical notions of form\nand matter to logical objects such as sentences and arguments in any\nsystematic way; this crucial step was undertaken by the ancient\ncommentators. References to the form and matter of syllogisms are\npervasive in their writings, especially in commentaries on the\nPrior Analytics, from that of Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(2nd century AD) up to that of Ammonius (6th\ncentury AD). The ancient commentators not only distinguished between\nthe form and the matter of syllogisms: they sometimes also suggested\n(though usually rather obliquely) that the form of an argument is\nprecisely that in virtue of which it is valid and reliable. This would\nlater pave the way for the distinction between formal and material\nconsequences and the idea of validity in virtue of form. Here is an\nillustrative passage by Alexander of Aphrodisias:\n\nCombinations are called syllogistic and reliable if they do not alter\ntogether with differences in the matter \u2014 i.e. if they do not\ndeduce and prove different things at different times, but always and\nin every material instance preserve one and the same form in the\nconclusion. Combinations which change and alter configuration together\nwith the matter and acquire different and conflicting conclusions at\ndifferent times, are non-syllogistic and unreliable. (Alexander of\nAphrodisias, in Apr 52.20\u201324, 114)\n\n\nAlexander also comments on Aristotle\u2019s use of schematic letters, and\nclearly relates what takes the place of schematic letters to the\nmatter of the argument:\n\nHe uses letters in his exposition in order to indicate to us that the\nconclusions do not depend on the matter but on the figure, on the\nconjunction of the premises and on the moods. For so-and-so is deduced\nsyllogistically not because the matter is of such-and-such a kind but\nbecause the combination is so-and-so. The letters, then, show that the\nconclusion will be such-and-such universally, always, and for every\nassumption. (Alexander of Aphrodisias, in Apr\n53.28\u201354.2, 116)\n\n\nIn first instance, the Greek logical heritage was almost\nsingle-handedly (though selectively) passed on to the Latin tradition\nby one man, the neo-platonic philosopher Boethius. Prior to the late\n12th century (Aristotle\u2019s and other ancient texts became\nwidely read again in the Christian parts of Europe only in the\n12th century \u2014 see (Dod 1982)), what the medieval\nauthors had inherited from Greek logic had been almost exclusively\ntransmitted by Boethius, who had also established the logical\nterminology in Latin. His translations of Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories and De Interpretatione were widely read,\nas well as his textbooks on syllogistic and his two texts De\nhypotheticis syllogismis (On Hypothetical Syllogisms\n\u2013 HS) (dating 516\u2013522) and De topicis\ndifferentiis (On Topical differentiae \u2014 TD)\n(dating 522\u2013523).\n\nBoethius uses the term \u2018consequentia\u2019 to refer to\nthat which a hypothetical sentence such as \u2018If it\u2019s day, then\nit\u2019s light\u2019 signifies:\n\nFor it [the sentence] does not propose that it\u2019s day and it\u2019s light,\nbut rather that if it\u2019s day, then it\u2019s light. Whence it signifies a\ncertain consequence (consequentia) and not the being [of\nthings]. (Boethius, Commentary on \u2018On\nInterpretation\u2019 2, 109\u201310, translation in Martin\n2009,\n 67.)[5]\n\n\nIt is from Boethius that later authors inherited the term\n\u2018consequentia\u2019, but the influence of Boethius is\nnot only terminological. In HS, he focuses on conditionals of the form\n\u201cIf something\u2019s (not) A, then it\u2019s (not)\nB\u201d (si (non) est A,\n(non) est B), and lists a number of principles and\nrules governing the logical behavior of such sentences (Martin 2009,\n66\u201378). Boethius\u2019 considerations are not sufficiently worked-out\nas to be viewed as a full-fledged \u2018theory of consequence\u2019,\nand indeed there are a number of tensions and inconsistencies in his\ndoctrines. But HS will prove to be an important source for the later\ndevelopment of theories of consequence. For example, in this text\nBoethius introduces the distinction between natural and accidental\nconsequences, which then remains the main subdivision of consequences\nup until the beginning of 14th century (when it is surpassed by the\ndistinction between formal and material consequences) (Martin 2018) (Archambault 2018a). For Boethius, both kinds of consequences, natural and accidental, entail\ninseparability, roughly meaning that the antecedent cannot be true\nwhile the consequent is false (i.e. a version of (TP)), but natural\nconsequences entail something more, namely a real causal, metaphysical\nconnection between the items in question.\n\nThe other text mentioned above, De topicis differentiis, is\nequally significant for the development of later theories of\nconsequence. It presents a discussion of Cicero\u2019s Topics,\nwhich in turn claims to have been inspired by Aristotle\u2019s\nTopics. Cicero\u2019s work, however, is very different from\nAristotle\u2019s, and Boethius in some sense attempts to offer a\nunification of both approaches (he also discusses the dialectical\ntopics of the Greek commentator Themistius). One of the key concepts\nintroduced by this text is the concept of \u2018maximal\npropositions\u2019, which he claims are the general principles\nunderlying the correctness of topical arguments. As described by C.\nMartin,\n\nSuch [maximal] propositions may either appear as a premise in a\ncategorical syllogism or, much more importantly for the history of\nlogic, as the warrant for an inference. In this second case they are\nthe generalizations of the consequential relation which may hold\nbetween the premises and conclusion of an enthymeme or the antecedent\nand the conclusion of a conditional proposition. (Martin 2009, 79)\n\n\nCrucially, topical arguments were originally seen as merely probable,\ncontrasting with the necessary truth-preservation of syllogisms. So\nfor maximal propositions to serve as grounds for the relation of\nconsequence, a transformation on the status of topical arguments (from\nprobable to necessary) had to occur at a later stage (Stump 1982,\n290). Moreover, it is important to notice that, although Boethius is\nfamiliar with the work of the Greek ancient commentators and\nincorporates some elements from their discussions, he does not\nexplicitly apply the form vs. matter distinction to syllogisms, as the\nearlier authors had done. Barnes (1990) suggests that the logical\nhylomorphism (i.e. the application of Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of form and\nmatter to logic) of these authors is nevertheless present in Boethius\u2019\nterminology, such as in the opposition between propositionum\ncomplexio and rerum natura (the structure of a sentence\nvs. the nature of things) (e.g. HS II ii 5). But Boethius does not\npresent the idea of substitution/variation of terms as a property\nrelated to the validity of arguments, as Alexander of Aphrodisias had\nsuggested. In other words, substitutivity of terms as captured by (ST)\nis not a key element of Boethius\u2019 account of validity \u2014 neither\nterminologically nor conceptually.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Boethius was the first to formulate a\nversion of (Co) with respect to consequences (Green-Pedersen\n1984). However, on closer inspection, Boethius\u2019 notion of\ncontainment is not really used to define or describe the relation\nbetween the antecedent and the consequent of a consequence (Bosman\n2018). Instead, the Boethian relation of containment in question seems\nto pertain primarily to metaphysical relations of containment between\ngenus, species and differentiae. For example, an argument based on the\ntopic from genus involves a notion of containment: the genus is taken\nto contain something that the species is then also inferred to\ncontain. For example, since all mammals are mortal, we can infer that\nhuman beings are mortal too: the genus \u2018mammal\u2019 contains something,\nnamely mortality, that the species \u2018human being\u2019 also contains (Bosman\n2018, 235). This metaphysical notion of containment then gives rise to\na related semantic notion, which establishes relations of semantic\ncontainment between concepts (Bosman 2018). The upshot is thus that\nBoethius does not seem to have had in mind a relation of containment\nbetween antecedent and consequent, but his observations on what the\nmetaphysics of genus and species entails for certain forms of\ninference may well have been the historical precursor of (Co).\n",
