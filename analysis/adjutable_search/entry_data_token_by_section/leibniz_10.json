(G III 245/AG 286)\n\n\nFor Leibniz, the fundamental questions of metaphysics were reducible\nto questions of ontology: What is there? What are the most basic\ncomponents of reality? What grounds what? In a certain sense, his answer remained constant\nthroughout his life: everything is composed of or reducible to\nsimple substances; everything is grounded in simple\nsubstances. While Leibniz appears to have given slightly different\naccounts of the precise nature of these simple substances over the\ncourse of his career, there are many features that remained constant\nin his mature philosophy: Leibniz always believed that a substance had\na \u201ccomplete individual concept\u201d and that it was\nessentially an active unity endowed with perception and appetition.\n",
