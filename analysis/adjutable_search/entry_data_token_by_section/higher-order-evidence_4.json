    "main_text": "Denying the Import of Higher-Order Evidence || Consequences of denying the import of higher-order evidence\n2.3 Consequences of denying the import of higher-order evidence\n\nIf we hold that higher-order evidence does not have first-order\nrational effects, what should we say about cases like Hypoxia? There\nare two mainstream options defended in the literature.\n\u201cLevel-Splitters\u201d suggest that Aisha\u2019s first-order\nbelief (about G) should follow her first-order evidence, so\nshe should be highly confident of G. But her higher-order\nbelief (about her own rationality, or about what her first-order\nevidence supports) should follow her higher-order evidence.\n\u201cSteadfasters\u201d argue that Aisha should just dismiss the\nhigher-order evidence altogether\u2014believe G, and believe\nthat her evidence supports it. (See Alexander 2013, however, for an\nargument that no response is justified in Aisha\u2019s case,\nand Leonard 2020 for an argument that it is indeterminate what Aisha\nshould believe.)\n\nDefenders of the Level-Splitting view include Lasonen-Aarnio (2014),\nCoates (2012), Weatherson (ms\u2013see Other Internet Resources),\nWilliamson (2014), and Wedgwood (2012). The obvious advantage is that\nthis view straightforwardly takes all of Aisha\u2019s evidence into\naccount: her evidence about G affects her beliefs about\nG, and her evidence about her epistemic situation affects her\nbeliefs about her epistemic situation. An obvious upshot of this view\nis that epistemic akrasia can be rational: in particular, in Hypoxia,\nAisha should end up believing G, while also believing that\nher evidence likely doesn\u2019t support G.\n\nBut admitting rational epistemic akrasia in this case incurs a large\nintuitive cost. As Horowitz (2014) argues, if epistemic akrasia is\nrational in cases like Aisha\u2019s, then so is bootstrapping: if\nAisha finds herself in this situation a number of times in a row, or\nregarding a number of different beliefs, she can use her first-order\nbeliefs to establish a fantastic track record of success, ultimately\ndismissing the possibility that she was ever rationally impaired. This\nreasoning looks absurd\u2014because, presumably, there is a tension\nbetween strongly holding a belief while also believing one\u2019s\nevidence doesn\u2019t support it. So why allow this tension in even\none case? Horowitz also illustrates other examples of irrational\nreasoning and action that seem warranted by epistemic akrasia; see\nalso Brown 2018, Littlejohn 2018, and Silva 2018 for further\ndiscussion of intuitively irrational reasoning and action licensed by\nepistemic akrasia in these cases, as well as Feldman 2005 for an\nearlier rejection of epistemic akrasia in similar circumstances.\n\nThe second possibility is to say that higher-order evidence simply has\nno effect on first-order or higher-order beliefs. (Following\nthe peer disagreement literature, we could call this a\n\u201csteadfast\u201d view; Smithies [2019] calls it \u201cupward\npush\u201d.) Kelly (2005) seems to tentatively support this view in\nthe context of peer disagreement (though his later work defends a more\nmoderate \u201ctotal evidence\u201d view; see, for example, Kelly\n2010). Titelbaum (2015) argues for the nearby position that a rational\nagent can never be mistaken about the rational requirements that apply\nto her situation (although she might be rationally uncertain as to\nwhich situation she is in); he writes that \u201cmistakes about\nrationality are mistakes of rationality\u201d.\nTitelbaum\u2019s argument for this rests on the assumption that\nepistemic akrasia is irrational. (See also Titelbaum 2019. See C.\nField 2019 for criticism of this position.) Tal (2021) also defends\nthe steadfast view, in part appealing to the irrationality of\nepistemic akrasia.\n\nSmithies (2019; see especially ch. 10) gives an extended defense of a\nsteadfast view. He argues that ideal rationality requires rational\nomniscience\u2014that is, omniscience both about what the rational\nrequirements are and which requirements apply to one at all times.\nThis means that misleading higher-order evidence is, in an important\nsense, impossible to come by. While non-ideal agents like Aisha may be\nmistaken about what evidence they have or what it supports, these\nmistakes are themselves departures from ideal rationality. (Smithies\nalso supplements this with a view about non-ideal rationality, which\nis discussed below.)\n\nOne of the primary objections to the steadfast view is that ignoring\nhigher-order evidence appears to be blatantly dogmatic: it is hard to\nsee how it could be rational for Aisha to continue believing\nG with no reduction in confidence, after hearing that her\naltitude puts her at risk of hypoxia. (Though Tom Kelly has argued\n[see Kelly 2013, for example] that dogmatism in such cases is not\ninherently irrational.) Additionally, acting on her belief that\nG\u2014say, setting off for Hawaii with a plane full of\npassengers\u2014would be shockingly irresponsible, suggesting that\nsomething is wrong with the belief that G. (See Christensen\n2010a, for example.)\n\nCases like Hypoxia therefore leave us with three choices. If we say\nthat Aisha should maintain confidence in G, but reduce\nconfidence that it\u2019s rational for her to belief G, we\nmust explain why epistemic akrasia can be rational. If we say she\nshould maintain confidence in G and dismiss the possibility\nof hypoxia, we must explain why dogmatism can be rational. And if we\nsay she should reduce confidence in G, we must explain how\nthis type of defeat works, and how it fits into our broader theory of\nrationality. Let us now return to that last question.\n",
