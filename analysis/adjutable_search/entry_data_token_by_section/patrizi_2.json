    "main_text": "Defense of Platonism\n3. Defense of Platonism\n\n\nIn rejecting the Peripatetic conceptions so dominant in philosophy\nand science, Patrizi was clearly motivated not only by his desire to\nreplace what he took to be incorrect views contained in the\nAristotelian works but by his wide reading and critical study of many\nof the major sources associated with the Platonic tradition. In\naddition to the translations of and commentaries on the Platonic\ndialogues and the works of Plotinus published by Marsilio Ficino,\nPatrizi's knowledge of Greek gave him access to a body of\nwritings from other relevant authors. Besides translating John\nPhiloponus' commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics,\nProclus' Elements of Theology and Physical\nElements, he was well versed in the works of thinkers such as\nAntiochus of Ascalon, Cicero, Ammonius Saccas, Boethius and Augustine,\nwho actively sought to incorporate Platonic teachings as an essential\npart of their own views, as well as Platonically-influenced\ncontemporaries such as Francesco Verino il Secondo and Jacopo\nMazzoni. He argued actively for the replacement of\nAristotle's works as the model for philosophical and scientific\neducation at the University level, and his holding chairs in Platonic\nphilosophy at both Ferrara and Rome indicates his success in bringing\nhis ideal to fruition.\n\n\nWhat were some of the major advantages Patrizi felt Platonism had\nover Aristotelianism and how does his own scientific-philosophical\nsynthesis reflect this conviction?  This is best illustrated in\nhis major work, the Nova de universis philosophia (Patrizi\n1591, reprint with variants dated 1593). The work consists of\nfour major parts, combining, as he claims in the title, Aristotelian,\nPatrizian and Platonic methods to produce a new philosophy. This\nnew system involves three stages, initially ascending, as\nAristotle's had, to the First Cause, but not by using motion to\nreach the \u201cUnmoved Mover\u201d, but rather by employing light\n(lux) and illumination (lumen) to attain to the\nFather of Lights. Then the Patrizian method will provide an\nanalysis of the Divinity, followed by the employment of a Platonic\nmethod to show how all creation is derived from God. Although on\nthe surface such a program could be seen as falling within the\nboundaries of the conciliatory model which many of his contemporaries\nused to incorporate both Platonic and Aristotelian elements into their\nthought, a closer analysis reveals the underlying Platonic nature of\nhis undertaking.\n\n\nThe four major sections of the Nova \u2026 Philosophia are\nas follows: Panaugia, or \u201cAll-Splendor\u201d;\nPanarchia, or \u201cAll Principles\u201d;\nPampsychia, or \u201cAll-Soul\u201d and Pancosmia,\nor \u201cAll-Cosmos\u201d.  It has been emphasized (Kristeller 1964,\n120) that Patrizi's selection of light as the basis of his initial\n\u201cAristotelian\u201d method of establishing the existence of God\nas \u201cFirst Light\u201d involves a departure from an Aristotelian\napproach in favor of a more Platonic one, although this has been\ncalled into question (Ryan 2002, 192-195). The key point seems to be\nwhy light rather than motion is elevated by Patrizi to the status of\nthe primary basis for an a posteriori proof of God's\nexistence as First Cause.  From a Platonic perspective, the answer\nseems clear.  Plato's use of the Sun as the physical counterpart of\nthe Good in the Republic and his extensive use of visual\nmetaphors for intellective processes (rather than, for example, the\ntactile images that later Stoic thinkers would employ in arguing that\nthe mind can \u201cgrasp\u201d certain appearances) strongly suggest\nthat Patrizi was seeking to replace the Aristotelian model with a\nPlatonic one. The fact that the notion of \u201cseeing\u201d the\ntruth would become standard in later Platonic sources such as Plotinus\nand lead to the development of what has been termed Neoplatonic Light\nMetaphysics only strengthens the case. In the Panaugia\nPatrizi construes light as an intermediary between the corporeal and\nincorporeal realms. The existence of light in the corporeal realm\nargues for the existence of a purely incorporeal light, and indeed\nPatrizi construes God as the Lux Prima from which by\nillumination proceeds the entire realm of incorporeal entities.  God\nis also the ultimate source of corporeal light as well (Vasoli\n1991).\n\n\n In contrast to the Panaugia's emphasis on the\ncentrality of light, the Panarchia, constituting as it does\nthe initial application of the overtly \u201cPatrizian\u201d method\nmentioned in the title of the work, builds upon a pattern more familiar\nto students of the Platonic tradition. Dedicated to showing how\nthe levels of reality flow from the ultimate cause, Patrizi's\nontology draws upon such Platonic predecessors as Plotinus, Proclus and\nMarsilio Ficino to present a ten-level system. Beginning with\nGod, whom he terms the \u201cOne-All\u201d (Un'omnia),\nhe establishes Unity, Essence, Life, Intelligence, Soul, Nature,\nQuality, Form and Body as the succeeding categories which constitute\nthe incorporeal and corporeal universe. Such a pastiche would\ndoubtless resonate with students of the history of Platonism. God\nthus is viewed as having both internal and external products in\nPatrizi's version of what might be termed the \u201cchain of\nbeing\u201d.\n\n\nThe third section of the Nova \u2026 Philosophia, the\nPampsychia, focuses on Soul as an intermediary between the\nspiritual and corporeal realms. As has been pointed out\n(Kristeller 1964, 122), Soul thus plays a role similar to that assigned\nto Light in the Panaugia, but the precise relationship between\nthe two is not dealt with. The soul of an individual living being\nhas the same connection to its body as the World Soul has to the\nuniverse as a whole; thus the Anima mundi is not simply a\ncollection of individual souls but a separate entity which vivifies the\nuniverse as a distinct reality.\n\n\nThe fourth and final part of Patrizi's work, the\nPancosmia, shows how the physical world derives its existence\nfrom the supramundane realities discussed previously and how a\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d method may be used to arrive at an understanding\nof the connections between the two realms. Thus Patrizi puts\nforward a model for the understanding of the universe which bridges the\ngap between philosophy and science and incorporates methodologies for\nexplaining physical and astronomical phenomena which would resonate\nwith thinkers seeking to establish an alternative approach to the study\nof nature from the largely qualitative analysis embodied in\nAristotle's natural philosophy.
