    "main_text": "Variations || Different treatments of modality\n6.1 Different treatments of modality\n\nIf one uses traditional sequent calculus presentations, the exponentials are not\ncanonical in the following sense: if you introduce another copy of\nexponentials, say \\(\\bang'\\) and \\(\\quest'\\), with the same rules as\nthe original ones, there is no way to prove that \\(\\bang\\) is\nequivalent to \\(\\bang'\\), and \\(\\quest\\) to \\(\\quest'\\), while for the\nother connectives this is easily established. Various applications of\nnon-canonical exponentials can be found in\n (Danos et. al., 1993;\n Nigam & Miller, 2009). Although the decidability of MELL is currently being\ndebated\n (Bimb\u00f3 2015,\n Stra\u00dfburger 2019), extending MLL with three pairs of \\(\\bang\\) and\n\\(\\quest\\) yields a logic that is undecidable\n (Chaudhuri 2018).\n Martini and Masini\n 1995\n describe a \u201c2-sequent\u201d proof system in which the\nexponentials are canonical.\n\nThe fact that cut-elimination can make proofs in classical and\nintuitionistic logic grow to enormous size can be analyzed in terms of\nthe application of the contraction rule in those proof systems. If\nproof systems introduce restrictions on contraction, it is possible to\ndesign new logics and proof systems for which cut-elimination has a\nmuch-reduced complexity. For example, elementary linear logic\n(ELL) is obtained by replacing the \\(\\bang\\) and \\(\\quest\\)\nintroduction by a single rule introducing \\(\\bang\\) and \\(\\quest\\) at\nthe same time. As a consequence, ELL can encode all and only the\nKalmar elementary functions (computable in time bounded by a tower of\nexponentials of fixed height)\n (Girard 1998,\n Baillot 2015). Still, other variations on the inference rules for the\nexponentials have been studied. For example, light linear\nlogic\n (Girard 1998)\n and soft linear logic\n (Lafont 2004)\n both characterize functions computable in polynomial time: see also\n (Baillot & Terui 2004).\n \n",
