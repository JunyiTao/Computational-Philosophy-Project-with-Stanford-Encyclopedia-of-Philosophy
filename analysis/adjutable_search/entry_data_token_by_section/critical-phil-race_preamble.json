    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe field that has come to be known as the Critical Philosophy of\nRace is an amalgamation of philosophical work on race that largely\nemerged in the late 20th century, though it draws from earlier work. It\ndeparts from previous approaches to the question of race that dominated\nthe modern period up until the era of civil rights. Rather than\nfocusing on the legitimacy of the concept of race as a way to\ncharacterize human differences, Critical Philosophy of Race approaches\nthe concept with a historical consciousness about its function in\nlegitimating domination and colonialism, engendering a critical\napproach to race and hence the name of the sub-field. Critical\nPhilosophy of Race has also departed from broadly liberal approaches\nthat have narrowed racism to individual and intentional forms.\n\nThus, the Critical Philosophy of Race offers a critical analysis of\nthe concept as well as of certain philosophical problematics regarding\nrace. In this approach, it takes inspiration from Critical Legal\nStudies and the interdisciplinary scholarship in Critical Race Theory,\nboth of which explore the ways in which social ideologies operate\ncovertly in the mainstream formulations of apparently neutral concepts,\nsuch as merit or freedom. While borrowing from these approaches, the\nCritical Philosophy of Race has a distinctive philosophical methodology\nprimarily drawing from critical theory, Marxism, pragmatism,\nphenomenology, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, and hermeneutics,\neven while subjecting these traditions to critique for their omissions\nin regard to specifically racial forms of domination and the resultant\ninadequacy of their conceptual frameworks (Outlaw 1996; Allen 2016;\nWeheliye 2014; Alcoff 2006).\n\nThe main problems addressed by the Critical Philosophy of Race\nconcern the social and historical construction of races, the structural\nand systemic nature of racist cultures, the relevance of race to\nformations of selfhood, the mutual constitution of race and class as\nwell as other categories of identity, and the question of how to assess\nthe existing canon of modern philosophy.\n",
