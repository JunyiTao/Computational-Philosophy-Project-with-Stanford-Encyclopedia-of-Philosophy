The traditional Linnean binomial system of\nclassification groups organisms into species and genera in virtue of\ntheir overall physical similarities (their morphology). However, only\nthe taxa species and genus were held to reflect\nontological divisions in nature. The higher taxa (e.g.,\nfamily, order, class, phylum,\nkingdom) are merely conventional divisions, which are of\nheuristic use in biology.\n\nBiologists offer many different species concepts, which disagree on\nhow species are individuated; indeed the different species concepts\nwill disagree about the extensions of species and about the number of\nspecies. For example, according to the interbreeding species concept\n(e.g. Mayr 1969), species are groups of interbreeding natural\npopulations, that are reproductively isolated from other groups.\nAlternatively, according to the phylogenetic approach to species (e.g.\nCracraft 1983), species are classified according to common ancestral\ndescent. These two approaches carve species differently. Some\nphylogenetic species fail to be interbreeding species. For example,\norganisms that reproduce asexually may nevertheless have a common\ndescent. They will be grouped together as species by the phylogenetic\napproach, but not by the interbreeding approach (see Ereshefsky 1998\nfor discussion). Philosophers question whether the multiple divisions\nused by biologists reflect an ontological pluralism in the world or,\nalternatively, whether there is a privileged conception of species\nthat captures ontological reality. Furthermore, some philosophers\nargue that species are not to be considered as natural kinds at all,\ninsisting instead that species are individuals.\n2.1.1 Species: Individuals or Kinds?\n\nDespite its long history and intuitive appeal, the conception of\nspecies as natural kinds is difficult to sustain while also\nmaintaining a traditional view of what a natural kind requires: a set\nof intrinsic natural properties that are individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for a particular to be a member of the kind.\n\nThe fact that lineages evolve more or less gradually over time and\nthat this process leads to new species and other taxa, has two\nconsequences: first, that species are spatio-temporally restricted in\nthe sense that the species to which a particular organism belongs\ndepends on its being related to a specific lineage; and secondly, that\nthe characteristic properties of a species may change over time.\n\nThe first consequence of evolution implies that, contra the\ntraditional view, intrinsically identical organisms may not be members\nof the same species: a cat-like organism independently evolved on a\ndistant planet would not be a cat. (Cf. Dummett 1973: 144 \u2018even\nif creatures exactly like men arose from dragons\u2019\nteeth, they would not be men, because not children of\nAdam\u2019.)\n\nThe second consequence implies that intrinsic similarity is not\nnecessary for membership of the same species. There exists a high\ndegree of variation in intraspecific morphology and genetic makeup.\nWhile members of kinds need not be intrinsically identical (e.g.,\nthere may be isotopic variation between samples of a chemical\nelement), there will nonetheless be certain distinctive intrinsic\nnatural properties common to all members of the kind (e.g., nuclear\ncharge in the case of atoms of the same element). That, it is claimed,\nis absent for species. Thus there is no genetic material or sequence\nof genes that all and only members of the species Drosophila\nmelanogaster possess, and likewise for all other species. Nor can\nwe turn to larger-scale phenotypic properties (which may nonetheless\nbe hidden), since evolutionary change may eliminate such features\nwithout a new species arising (Sober 1980). Furthermore, gradual\nchange, even through speciation, means that species will not be\ncategorically distinct (Criterion 6), which for Ellis (2001) is an\nadditional reason to conclude that species are not natural kinds.\n\nThese problems for the thesis that species are natural kinds may lead\none to conclude that classification by species does not correspond to\nany real division of things in nature any more than the higher taxa\ndo. Darwin himself expressed this kind of conventionalism, in taking\nspecies to differ only in degree from varieties on the one hand and\ngenera and higher taxa on the other hand:\n\nVarieties have the same general characters as species, for they cannot\nbe distinguished from species,\u2014except, firstly, by the discovery\nof intermediate linking forms\u2026and except, secondly, by a\ncertain amount of difference, for two forms, if differing very little,\nare generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate\nlinking forms have not been discovered. (Darwin 1859, 57)\n\n\n(Mishler 1999 contains a modern version of this view.) The rejection\nof species as natural kinds need not lead to the rejection of realism\nabout species altogether. Indeed, one can commit to species realism in\na specific way: Ghiselin (1974, 1987, 1995, 1997), Hull (1976, 1978,\n1980, 1987), and many other philosophers and biologists accept the\nclaim that species are individuals, not kinds. This claim\nwould appear to explain why, it is said, there are no serious\ncandidates for biological laws, at least concerning members of\nparticular species (Beatty 1997). Individual organisms are\nparts of species, not members of the species-kind. Speciation\ncreates a new individual (or possibly two new individuals and the\ncessation of the preceding species-individual) but not a new kind.\nOrganisms that are parts of the same species may share common\nfeatures, but that is not what makes them parts of that species.\nRather the explanation is the reverse: because the organisms are parts\nof the same species they are parts of the same lineage and so they\nwill probably (but not inevitably) share features in common.\n\nDoes individualism about species imply that species are not natural\nkinds? One might suspect as much, but perhaps the two views are\ncompatible. LaPorte (2004), for example, believes that one can\nconsistently hold both views. Where one theorist will see a\nspecies-as-kind and an organism-as-member of that kind, another\ntheorist will see a species-as-individual and an organism-as-part of\nthat kind. And so even allowing that individualism is correct, we can\nconstruct a kind: if S is a species-individual and x\nis an organism, then x is a member of the species-kind\nS* iff x is a part of S. For\nexample, an individual organism (a radish plant) is a part of the\nspecies-individual Raphanus Sativus if and only if it is a\nmember of the species-kind Raphanus Sativus (LaPorte 2004,\n16). LaPorte\u2019s view does entail giving up on certain features\nthat natural kinds are often thought to have; one cannot still hold\nthat kind membership is necessarily intrinsic, since \u2018being a\npart of y\u2019 is not an intrinsic property and parts of\nthe same entity do not necessarily have any intrinsic properties in\ncommon. For that reason, it is also less plausible that kinds must\nplay a role in laws of nature.\n\nIf one retains the view that species are natural kinds one must\nconfront the fact that a plethora of species concepts are available\nand as seen earlier, these species concepts do not always delineate\nthe same species. For example, Mayr\u2019s (1969) biological\nspecies concept (BSC) regards a species as a group of\n\u201cinterbreeding natural populations that are reproductively\nisolated from other such populations\u201d (1969, 26). The\nphylogenetic species concept (PSC) holds that a species is\n\u201cthe smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within\nwhich there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent\u201d\n(Cracraft 1983, 170). These definitions are not perfectly coextensive.\n(For a detailed discussion of species concepts see the entry on\n species.)\n\nThis diversity may be thought to support conventionalism about natural\nkinds (Section 1.1.2). But supporters of naturalism about our\nclassifications (Section 1.1.1) will deny that the dispute in\nsystematics reflects an indeterminacy in the natural world. A\nmonist will hold that one of the existing systems is a\nsuperior account of the natural world. A commitment to one of the\ndifferent systems over another will result in a different ontological\naccount of species. The most prevalent system of classification in\ncontemporary systematics is cladistics, which classifies organisms\nphylogenetically, in virtue of shared derived features or an\norganism\u2019s place in the genealogical tree.\n\nAn alternative view to monism, motivated by the variety of species\nconcepts, is pluralism, which holds that the different\naccounts of species in systematics reflect equally legitimate ways of\ncarving up nature subject to our pragmatic and theoretical interests.\nHowever, these systems do carve nature in genuinely natural ways. The\nspecies and higher taxa that they delineate reflect real features of\nthe world from the point of view of different theoretical interests.\nPluralism (Kitcher 1984; Dupr\u00e9 1993; Ereshefsky 1992) is the\nweakest form of realism about kinds in the philosophy of biology.\n2.1.2 Biological Essentialism\n\nKripke (1971, 1972) and Putnam (1975a) use animal kinds as examples of\nnatural kinds for which a posteriori essences can be found.\nThere is some implication that these essences are microstructural,\nintrinsic properties, which will be, of necessity, individually\nnecessary and jointly sufficient for an entity to be a member of a\nkind. However, if species are individuals, then it is not true that\nspecies may be individuated on the basis of the intrinsic properties\nof their members. The various species concepts tend to offer\nrelational criteria of species membership (see above). According to\nthe BSC, for example, membership of a species depends on relational\nproperties, such as membership of a certain population and\ninterbreeding. Alternatively, the PSC refers to shared descent.\n\nHowever, Kripke (1980) himself argues that a person\u2019s parentage\nis essential to them. If that is so, then if individual S is\ndescended from N, then S is necessarily descended\nfrom N. McGinn (1976) suggests that this extends to species\nalso. LaPorte (2004) argues that essentialism holds with respect to\nfacts relating individuals, species, and other taxa to the higher taxa\n(genus and above) within which they are nested. These taxa are clades,\nthat is to say kinds defined by shared descent from a common ancestral\ngroup: an individual or group that is a member or part of clade is\nnecessarily a member or part of that clade. Thus biological kinds\n(species, genera, etc.) do have essential properties, and these are\nhistorical rather than intrinsic properties.\n\nSo one option for biological essentialism is to drop the traditional\nview that the natural properties that are essential for membership of\na natural kind are intrinsic: natural, extrinsic (relational)\nproperties can play this role (Okasha 2002). The categorical\ndistinctness criterion must be dropped also.\n",
