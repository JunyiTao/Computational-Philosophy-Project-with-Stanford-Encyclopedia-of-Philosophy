    "main_text": "Fourth Case Study: The Limits of Knowledge || Self-Knowledge\n4.3 Self-Knowledge\n\nEven if we can\u2019t know some things, might we at least have\nunlimited access to our own knowledge? Are we at least always able to\ndiscern whether we know something? A popular axiom in the logic of\nmetaphysical necessity is the so-called S4 axiom: \\(\\Box \\phi \\supset\n\\Box \\Box \\phi\\). This says that whatever is necessary had to\nbe necessary. In epistemic logic, the corresponding formula is:\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\bf KK\\)}\nK \\phi \\supset KK \\phi\n\\]\n\n\nThis says roughly that whenever we know something, we know that we\nknow it. Hintikka (1962) famously advocates including\nKK as an axiom of epistemic logic. But an influential\nargument due to Williamson (2000) suggests otherwise.\n\nThe argument hinges on the idea that knowledge can\u2019t be had by\nluck. Specifically, to know something, it must be that you\ncouldn\u2019t have been wrong very easily. Otherwise, though you\nmight be right, it\u2019s only by luck. For example, you might\ncorrectly guess that there are exactly 967 jellybeans in the jar on my\ndesk, but even though you\u2019re right, you just got lucky. You\ndidn\u2019t know there were 967 jellybeans, because there could\neasily have been 968 jellybeans without you noticing the\ndifference.\n\nTo formalize this \u201cno-luck\u201d idea, let the propositions\n\\(\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\), etc. say that the number of jellybeans is at least\n1, at least 2, etc. We\u2019ll assume you\u2019re eyeballing the\nnumber of jellybeans in the jar, not counting them carefully. Because\nyou\u2019re an imperfect estimator of large quantities of jellybeans,\nyou can\u2019t know that there are at least 967 jellybeans in the\njar. If you think there are at least 967 jellybeans, you could easily\nmake the mistake of thinking there are at least 968, in which case\nyou\u2019d be wrong. So we can formalize the \u201cnot easily\nwrong\u201d idea in this scenario as follows:\n\nSafety\n\n\\(K \\phi_i \\supset \\phi_{i+1}\\) when \\(i\\) is large (at least \\(100\\)\nlet\u2019s say). \n\nThe idea is that knowledge requires a margin for error, a margin of at\nleast one jellybean in our example. Presumably more than one\njellybean, but at least one. Within one jellybean of the true number,\nyou can\u2019t discern truth from falsehood. (See Nozick (1981) for a\ndifferent conception of a \u201cno luck\u201d requirement on\nknowledge, which Roush (2005; 2009) formalizes in probabilistic\nterms.)\n\nHaving explained all this to you though, here\u2019s something else\nyou now know: that the Safety thesis is true. So we\nalso have:\n\nKnowledge of Safety\n\n\\(K(K \\phi_i \\supset \\phi_{i+1})\\) when \\(i\\) is large. \n\nAnd combining Knowledge of Safety with\nKK yields an absurd result: \\begin{array}{rll}\n1.& K \\phi_{100}& \\mbox{Assumption}\\\\ 2.& KK\n\\phi_{100}& 1, \\mathbf{KK}\\\\ 3.& K(K \\phi_{100} \\supset\n\\phi_{101})& \\textbf{Knowledge of Safety}\\\\ 4.& KK \\phi_{100}\n\\supset K \\phi_{101}& 3, \\mathbf{K}\\\\ 5.& K \\phi_{101}&\n2,4, \\mathbf{MP}\\\\ &&\\mbox{repeat steps (2)\u2013(5) for\n}\\phi_{101}, \\phi_{102}, \\ldots, \\phi_n\\\\ m.& K \\phi_n& m-1,\n\\mathbf{MP}\\\\ m'.& \\phi_n& m, \\mathbf{T}\\\\ \\end{array}\n\n\nGiven the assumption on line (1), that you know there are at least\n\\(100\\) jellybeans in the jar (which you can plainly see), we can show\nthat there are more jellybeans in the jar than stars in the galaxy.\nSet \\(n\\) high enough and the jellybeans even outnumber the particles\nin the universe! (Notice that we don\u2019t rely on\nNEC anywhere in this derivation, so it\u2019s okay\nto use non-logical assumptions like line (1) and Knowledge of\nSafety.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the philosophical payoff if we join Williamson in\nrejecting KK on these grounds? Skeptical arguments\nthat rely on KK might be disarmed. For example, a\nskeptic might argue that to know something, you must be able to rule\nout any competing alternatives. For example, to know the external\nworld is real, you must be able to rule out the possibility that you\nare being deceived by Descartes\u2019 demon (Stroud 1984). But then\nyou must also be able to rule out the possibility that you\ndon\u2019t know the external world is real, since this is\nplainly an alternative to your knowing it is real. That is,\nyou must \\(K \\neg\\neg K\\phi\\), and thus \\(KK\\phi\\) (Greco 2014). So\nthe driving premise of this skeptical argument entails the\nKK thesis, which we\u2019ve seen reason to\nreject.\n\nOther skeptical arguments don\u2019t rely on KK, of\ncourse. For example, a different skeptical tack begins with the\npremise that a victim of Descartes\u2019 demon has exactly the same\nevidence as a person in the real world, since their experiential\nstates are indistinguishable. But if our evidence is the same in the\ntwo scenarios, we have no justification for believing we are in one\nrather than the other. Williamson (2000: ch. 8) deploys an argument\nsimilar to his reductio of KK against the\npremise that the evidence is the same in the real world and the demon\nworld. The gist is that we don\u2019t always know what evidence we\nhave in a given scenario, much as we don\u2019t always know what we\nknow. Indeed, Williamson argues that any interesting feature of our\nown minds is subject to a similar argument, including that it appears\nto us that \\(\\phi\\): \\(A\\phi \\supset KA\\phi\\) faces a similar\nreductio to that for \\(K\\phi \\supset KK \\phi\\).
