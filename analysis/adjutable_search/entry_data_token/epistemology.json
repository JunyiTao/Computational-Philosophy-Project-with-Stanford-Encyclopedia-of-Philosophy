The Varieties of Cognitive Success\n\nThere are many different kinds of cognitive success, and they differ\nfrom one another along various dimensions. Exactly what these various\nkinds of success are, and how they differ from each other, and how\nthey are explanatorily related to each other, and how they can be\nachieved or obstructed, are all matters of controversy. This section\nprovides some background to these various controversies.\n1.1 What Kinds of Things Enjoy Cognitive Success?\n\nCognitive successes can differ from each other by virtue of qualifying\ndifferent kinds of things. For instance, a cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of making a discovery\u2014may be the success\nof a person (e.g., Marie Curie), or of a laboratory (Los Alamos), or\nof a people (the Hopi), or even, perhaps, of a psychological fragment\nof a person (the unconscious). But some kinds of cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of having successfully cultivated a highly\ndiscriminating palate, say\u2014may be the success of a person, and\nperhaps even of a people, but cannot be the success of a laboratory or\nof a psychological fragment. And other kinds of cognitive\nsuccess\u2014like that of being conclusively established by all the\navailable evidence\u2014may be the success of a theory, but cannot be\nthe success of a person\u2014or like that of being epistemically\nfruitful\u2014may be the success of a research program, or of a\nparticular proof-strategy, but not of a theory. Indeed, there is a\nvast range of things, spanning different metaphysical categories, that\ncan enjoy one or another kind of cognitive success: we can evaluate\nthe cognitive success of a mental state (such as that of believing a\nparticular proposition) or of an act (such as that of drawing a\nparticular conclusion), or of a procedure (such as a particular\nprocedure for revising degrees of confidence in response to evidence,\nor a particular procedure for acquiring new evidence), or of a\nrelation (such as the mathematical relation between an agent\u2019s\ncredence function in one evidential state and her credence function in\nanother evidential state, or the relation of trust between one person\nand another).\n\nSome of the recent controversies concerning the objects of cognitive\nsuccess concern the metaphysical relations among the cognitive\nsuccesses of various kinds of objects: Does the cognitive success of a\nprocess involve anything over and above the cognitive success of each\nstate in the succession of states that comprise the execution of that\n process?[2]\n Does the cognitive success of a particular mental state, or of a\nparticular mental act, depend upon its relation to the larger process\nin which it\n exists?[3]\n Is the cognitive success of an organization constituted merely by the\ncognitive successes of its members, or is it something over and above\nthose individual\n successes?[4]\n Is the cognitive success of a doxastic agent completely explicable in\nterms of the successes of its doxastic states, or vice versa?\nAnd either way, what sorts of doxastic states are there, and with\nrespect to what kinds of possible success are they assessible? The\nlatter dispute is especially active in recent years, with some\nepistemologists regarding beliefs as metaphysically reducible to high\n credences,[5]\n while others regard credences as metaphysically reducible to beliefs\nabout probabilities (see Byrne in Brewer & Byrne 2005), and still\nothers regard beliefs and credences as related but distinct phenomena\n(see Kaplan 1996, Neta 2008). \n\nOther recent controversies concern the issue of whether it is a\nmetaphysically fundamental feature of the objects of\ncognitive success that they are, in some sense, supposed to enjoy the\nkind of cognitive success in question. For instance, we might think\nthat what it is for some group of people to constitute a\nlaboratory is that the group is, in some sense,\nsupposed to make discoveries of a certain kind: that is the\npoint of bringing that group into collaboration in a particular way,\neven if the individuals are spread out across different continents and\ntheir funding sources diverse. But even if a laboratory is plausibly\ncharacterized by a norm to which it is answerable, is something\nanalogous true of the other objects that can enjoy cognitive success?\nIs it, for instance, a metaphysically fundamental feature of a belief\nthat it is, in some sense, supposed to be\n knowledge?[6]\n Or can belief be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this\nnorm? Is it, for instance, a metaphysically fundamental feature of a\nperson that such a creature is, in some sense, supposed to be\n rational?[7]\n Or can persons be metaphysically characterized without appeal to this\nnorm? Similar disputes arise for the other objects of cognitive\nsuccess: to what extent can we understand what these objects are\nwithout appeal to the kinds of success that they are supposed to\nenjoy?\n\nIn speaking, as we have just now, of the kinds of success that objects\nare \u201csupposed\u201d to enjoy, we have left it open in what\nsense the objects of cognitive success are \u201csupposed\u201d to\nenjoy their success: is it that their enjoyment of that success is\ngood? (If so, then how is it good?) Or is it rather that their\nenjoyment of that success is required? (If so, then what requires it,\nand why?) We turn to that general topic next.\n1.2 Constraints and Values\n\nSome kinds of cognitive success involve compliance with a\nconstraint, while others involve the realization or promotion\nof values. We can contrast these two kinds of success by\ncontrasting the associated kinds of failure: failure to comply with a\nconstraint results in impermissibility, whereas failure to\nrealize some values results in\n sub-optimality.[8]\n Of course, if sub-optimality is always impermissible and vice\nversa, then the extension of these two categories ends\nup being the same, even if the two categories are not themselves the\nsame. But it is implausible to regard all sub-optimality as\nepistemically impermissible: cognitive success does not\nrequire us to be perfectly cognitively optimal in every way.\nIf cognitive success is ever achievable even in principle, then at\nleast some degree of cognitive sub-optimality must be permissible.\nAchieving greater optimality than what\u2019s required for cognitive\npermissibility could then be understood as cognitive\nsupererogation. If such supererogation is possible, at least\nin principle, then the permissible can fall short of the optimal.\n\nRecent controversies concern not merely the relation between\npermissibility and optimality, but also the metaphysical basis of each\nkind of success. In virtue of what is some state, or act, or process,\nor relation, epistemically permissible? And in virtue of what is it\noptimal to whatever degree it is? Epistemic consequentialists take the\nanswer to the former question to be determined by appeal to the answer\nto the latter. For instance, one popular form of epistemic\nconsequentialism claims that a particular way of forming one\u2019s\nbeliefs about the world is epistemically permissible just in so far as\nit promotes the possession of true belief and the avoidance of false\n belief.[9]\n Another form of consequentialism, consistent with but distinct from\nthe first, says that a \u201ccredence function\u201d (i.e., a\nfunction from propositions to degrees of confidence) is optimal just\nin so far as it promotes a single parameter\u2014overall\naccuracy\u2014which is measured in such a way that, the higher\none\u2019s confidence in true propositions and the lower one\u2019s\nconfidence in false propositions, the greater one\u2019s overall\n accuracy.[10]\n There are also some forms of epistemic consequentialism according to\nwhich optimality involves promotion of ends that are practical rather\nthan simply\n alethic.[11]\n An important controversy in the recent literature concerns the\nquestion of whether epistemic consequentialism is true (see Berker\n2013, which develops a line of argument found in Firth 1978 [1998]).\nAnother prominent controversy is carried on among consequentialists\nthemselves, and concerns the question of what values are such that\ntheir realization or promotion constitutes optimality.\n\nWe\u2019ve used the term \u201cconstraint\u201d to denote the\nbounds of what is epistemically permissible. Of course, as a matter of\ndeontic logic, what is permissible must include at least what is\nrequired: for a condition to be required is simply for the complement\nof that condition to not be permissible. But this leaves it open\nwhether, in a particular domain, what is permissible includes more\nthan what is required. Permissivists argue that it does (see\nSchoenfield 2014 for a defense of permissivism), while\nanti-permissivists argue that it does not (see White 2005 and\nSchultheis 2018 for arguments against permissivism).\nAnti-permissivists concerning constraints on our credences are\nsometimes described as holding a \u201cuniqueness\u201d view, but\nthis label can easily mislead. A philosopher who thinks that the range\nof permissible credences is no wider than the range of required\ncredences is an anti-permissivist\u2014but an anti-permissivist view,\nso understood, is consistent with the claim that the credences we are\nrequired to have are not point-valued but are rather interval-valued.\nSuch a philosopher could, for instance, claim that there is only one\ncredence that you are permitted to assign to the proposition that the\ncat is on the mat, and this required credence is neither .6 nor .7,\nbut is rather the open interval (.6, .7). \n1.3 Substantive and Structural\n\nCompare the following two rules:\n\n(MP-Narrow) If you believe that p is true, and you also\nbelieve that if p is true then q is true, then you ought to\nbelieve that q is true.\n(MP-Wide) You ought not be such that you believe that p is\ntrue, and believe that if p is true then q is true, and\nnot believe that q is true.\n\n\nThe first rule, MP-Narrow, is obviously not a rule with which we ought\nto comply: if q is obviously false, then it\u2019s not the case that\nI ought to believe that q is true\u2014not even if I believe\nthat p is true, and that if p is true then q is\ntrue. Nonetheless, if q is obviously false, then (perhaps) I\nought not both believe that p is true and also believe that\nif p is true then q is true. That\u2019s because, even if\nMP-Narrow is not a rule with which we ought to comply, MP-Wide may\nstill be such a rule. The difference between the two rules is in the\nscope of the \u201cought\u201d: in MP-Narrow, its scope includes\nonly one belief (viz., the belief that q is true), whereas in MP-Wide,\nits scope includes a combination of two beliefs (viz., that p is true,\nand that if p is true then q is true) and one lack of belief (viz.,\nthat q is true).\n\nThis linguistic distinction between wide scope and narrow scope\n\u201coughts\u201d is one expression of a general metaphysical\ndistinction between two kinds of cognitive success. On one side of\nthis distinction are those kinds of cognitive success that qualify\nparticular objects, e.g., a particular belief, or a particular\nprocedure, or a particular credence function, or a particular research\nprogram. Examples of such success include a belief\u2019s being\njustified, a procedure\u2019s being rationally required, a credence\nfunction\u2019s being optimal. In each case, some object enjoys a\nparticular cognitive success, and this success obtains by virtue of\nvarious features of that object: the features in question may be\nintrinsic or relational, synchronic or diachronic, biological or\nphenomenological, etc. We can call such cognitive successes\n\u201csubstantive\u201d.\n\nOn the other side of this distinction are those kinds of cognitive\nsuccess that qualify the relations between various things, each of\nwhich is itself individually assessable for cognitive success: e.g.,\nthe relation between a set of beliefs all held by the same agent at a\nparticular time, or the relation between the use of a particular\nprocedure, on the one hand, and one\u2019s beliefs about that\nprocedure, on the other, or the relation between an agent\u2019s\ncredence function just before receiving new evidence, and her credence\nfunction just after receiving new evidence. Examples of this latter\nkind of success include an agent\u2019s beliefs at a moment all being\nconsistent, or the coherence between the procedures an agent uses and\nher beliefs about which procedures she ought to use. In each case, a\nparticular cognitive success qualifies the relations among various\nobjects, quite independently of whether any particular one of those\nobjects itself enjoys substantive cognitive success. We can call such\ncognitive successes \u201cstructural\u201d. Some epistemologists\nhave attempted to reduce substantive successes of a particular kind to\nstructural\n successes.[12]\n Others have attempted to reduce structural successes of some kind to\nsubstantive ones (see, for instance, Kiesewetter 2017, Lasonen-Aarnio\nforthcoming, and Lord 2018). And still others have denied that any\nsuch reduction is possible in either direction (see, for instance,\nWorsnip 2018 and Neta 2018). In recent years, this controversy has\nbeen most active in connection with rational permissibility\nof beliefs, or of credences. But such a controversy could, in\nprinciple, arise concerning any of the varieties of cognitive success\nthat we\u2019ve distinguished so far.\n1.4. What Explains What?\n\nMany epistemologists attempt to explain one kind of cognitive success\nin terms of other kinds. For instance, Chisholm tries to explain all\ncognitive success notions in terms of just one primitive notion: that\nof one attitude being more reasonable than another, for an\nagent at a time (see Chisholm 1966). Williamson, in contrast, treats\nknowledge of facts as an explanatory primitive, and suggests that\nother kinds of cognitive success be explained in terms of such\nknowledge (see Williamson 2002). Several prominent philosophers treat\nthe notion of a normative reason as primitive (see Scanlon 1998). And\nso on. In each case, what is at issue is which kinds of cognitive\nsuccess are explicable in terms of which other kinds of cognitive\nsuccess. Of course, whether this issue is framed as an issue\nconcerning the explication of some concepts in terms of other\nconcepts, or in terms of the grounding of some properties by\nother properties, or in some other terms still, depends on the\nmetaphilosophical commitments of those framing the issue. \n\nThe issue of which kinds of cognitive success explain which\nother kinds of cognitive success is orthogonal to the issue of which\nparticular cognitive successes explain which other particular\ncognitive successes. The former issue concerns whether, for instance,\nthe property of knowledge is to be explained in terms of the relation\nof one thing being a reason for another, or whether the relation of\nbeing a reason for is to explained in terms of knowledge. But the\nlatter issue concerns whether, for instance, I am justified in holding\nsome particular belief\u2014say, that the cat is on the mat\u2014in\nvirtue of my knowing various specific things, e.g., that my vision is\nworking properly under the present circumstances, and that the object\nthat I am looking at now is a cat, etc. This latter issue is at the\nheart of various epistemological regress puzzles, and we will return\nto it below. But those regress puzzles are largely independent of the\nissue of metaphysical priority being discussed here.\n1.5 What Makes It Success?\n\nWhat makes it the case that something counts as a form of cognitive\nsuccess? For instance, why think that knowing the capital\nof Pakistan is a cognitive success, rather than just another\ncognitive state that an agent can occupy, like having 70%\nconfidence that Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan? Not every\ncognitive state enjoys cognitive success. Knowing, understanding,\nmastering\u2014these are cognitive successes. But being 70% confident\nin a proposition is not, in and of itself, a cognitive success, even\nif that state of confidence may be partly constitutive of an\nagent\u2019s cognitive success when the agent holds it in the right\ncircumstances and for the right reason. What makes the difference?\n\nRecent work on this issue tends to defend one of the following three\nanswers to this question: contractualism, consequentialism, or\nconstitutivism. The contractualist says that a particular cognitive\nstate counts as a kind of success because the practice of so counting\nit serves certain widely held practical interests. For instance,\naccording to Craig (1990), we describe a person as\n\u201cknowing\u201d something as a way of signaling that her\ntestimony with respect to that thing is to be trusted. The\nconsequentialist says that a particular cognitive state counts as a\nkind of success because it tends to constitute or tends to promote\nsome crucial benefit. According to some consequentialists, the benefit\nin question is that of having true beliefs and lacking false beliefs\n(see BonJour 1985, Audi 1993). According to others, it is the benefit\nof having a comprehensive understanding of reality. According to\nothers, it is a benefit that is not narrowly epistemic, e.g., living a\ngood life, or being an effective agent, or spreading one\u2019s gene\npool. Finally, the constitutivist may say that a particular cognitive\nstate counts as a kind of success if it is the constitutive aim of\nsome feature of our lives to achieve that state (see Korsgaard 2009\nfor a defense of constitutivism concerning norms of rationality). For\ninstance, the constitutivist might say that knowledge is a kind of\ncognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of belief,\nor that understanding is a kind of cognitive success by virtue of\nbeing the constitutive aim of reasoning, or that practical wisdom is a\nkind of cognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of\nall human activity. Of course, there are philosophers who count as\n\u201cconstitutivists\u201d by virtue of thinking, say, that\nknowledge is the constitutive aim of belief\u2014but these same\nphilosophers are not thereby committed to the constitutivism described\nhere, since they are not committed to this explanation of what\nmakes knowledge a kind of cognitive success.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that one of the three answers mentioned\nabove is correct for some kinds of success, while another of the three\nanswers is correct for other kinds of success. Consider, for instance,\nthe difference between the kind of success involved in having a state\nthat is fitting (for instance, holding a belief\nknowledgeably), and the kind of success involved in having a\nstate that is valuable (for instance, holding a belief the holding of\nwhich is beneficial). Perhaps the constitutivist can explain\nthe former kind of success better than the consequentialist can, but\nthe consequentialist can explain the latter kind of success better\nthan the constitutivist can. Of course, if and when the demands of\nthese different kinds of success conflict, the agent will face the\nquestion of how to proceed. Much recent work in epistemology has\nattempted to adjudicate that question, or to interrogate the\nassumption of possible conflict that gives rise to it (see, for\ninstance, Maru\u0161i\u0107 2015, McCormick 2015, and Rinard 2017a\nand 2019b).\n\nThese different ways of understanding cognitive success each give rise\nto a different understanding of the range of ways in which cognitive\nsuccess can be obstructed, and so a different understanding of the\nrange in which agents may be harmed, and sometimes even wronged, by\nsuch obstructions. For instance, on the contractualist view, epistemic\nharms may be built into the terms of the \u201ccontract\u201d. That\nis to say, such harms may be done not merely by the specific ways in\nwhich we interpret or implement our practice of epistemic appraisal,\nbut rather in the fundamental features of that practice itself. For\ninstance, a practice that grants the status of knowledge to a belief\nformed on the basis of clearly conceptualized sense perception, but\nnot to a belief formed on the basis of a less clearly conceptualized\nsense of a personal need, is a practice that systematically discredits\nbeliefs formed by exercises of empathy, relative to beliefs formed in\nother ordinary\n ways.[13]\n1.6 Epistemic Harms and Epistemic Wrongs\n\nObstructing an agent\u2019s cognitive success constitutes an\nepistemic harm. Wrongly obstructing an agent\u2019s cognitive success\nconstitutes an epistemic wrong. In a situation in which false\ntestimony would be an epistemic harm, dishonest testimony would be an\nepistemic wrong. But the range of epistemic harms and epistemic wrongs\ncan be much broader than those involving falsehood and deception.\nInsinuation, inattention, and indoctrination can all constitute\nepistemic harms or epistemic wrongs: each one can obstruct, and\nsometimes wrongly obstruct, an agent\u2019s cognitive success. For\ninstance, I can mislead you into drawing false conclusions, even if\nwhat I say is true: for instance, when I say \u201cthe victims were\nkilled by an immigrant\u201d, even if what I say is literally true,\nit can mislead my hearer into thinking that the killer\u2019s being\nan immigrant was in some way explanatorily relevant to her crime.\nAlternatively, I can harm you, and perhaps even wrong you, by getting\nyou to think poorly of your own capacity to grasp a subject by not\npaying attention to what you think or say. And finally, I can harm\nyou, and perhaps even wrong you, by indoctrinating you in a view so\nstrongly that you lose the ability to consider alternative views.\n\nThe epistemic harms and wrongs that we\u2019ve just mentioned occur\nfrequently in the course of daily life, and they are typically\nconstituted by some particular act that we perform (e.g., lending\ngreater credence to the word of a man over that of a woman, or using\nrhetorical devices to insinuate things that one doesn\u2019t know to\nbe true). But some of these harms and wrongs are constituted not by\nany particular act, but rather by the procedures that give rise to\nthose acts: for instance, when a research program in the life sciences\nimplicitly assumes an ideologically-driven conception of human nature\n(see Longino 1990 and Anderson 2004 for fascinating case studies). And\nsometimes, the harms and wrongs might even be built into our practice\nof epistemic appraisal\u2014perhaps even a tendency that is somehow\nconstitutive of that very practice. Suppose, for instance, that it is\nconstitutive of our practice of epistemic appraisal to count someone\nas knowing a fact only if they possess concepts adequate to\nconceptualize that fact. Whatever may be said in favor of our\npractice\u2019s having such a feature, one of its effects is clear:\nthose individuals who are cognitively most sensitive to facts for\nwhich adequate conceptual resources have not yet been devised (e.g.,\nsomeone living long before Freud who is sensitive to facts about\nrepression, or someone living in the nineteenth century who is\nsensitive to facts about sexual harassment) will find that the\ndeliverances of their unique cognitive sensitivities are not counted\nas knowledge. And so, these same individuals will not be granted the\nsame authority or credibility as other individuals, even when those\nlatter are less cognitively sensitive to the range of facts in\nquestion. Recent work in feminist epistemology has helped us to gain\nan appreciation of just how widespread this phenomenon is (see the\nseminal discussion of epistemic injustice in M. Fricker 2007, and the\ndevelopment of that account in Dotson 2014).\n2. What is Knowledge?\n\nKnowledge is among the many kinds of cognitive success that\nepistemology is interested in understanding. Because it has attracted\nvastly more attention in recent epistemology than any other variety\nof cognitive success, we devote the present section to considering it\nin some detail. But the English word \u201cknowledge\u201d lumps\ntogether various states that are distinguished in other languages: for\ninstance, the verb \u201cto know\u201d can be translated into French\neither as \u201cconnaitre\u201d or as\n\u201csavoir\u201d, and the noun \u201cknowledge\u201d\ncan be translated into Latin as either \u201ccognitio\u201d\nor as \u201cscientia\u201d. Exactly how to individuate the\nvarious kinds of cognitive success is not something that can be\ndetermined solely by appeal to the lexicon of any particular natural\nlanguage. The present section provides a brief survey of some of the\nkinds of cognitive success that are indicated by the use of\n\u201cknowledge\u201d in English, but this is not intended to signal\nthat these kinds of cognitive success are all species of some common\ngenus. Neither, however, is it intended to signal that these kinds of\ncognitive success are not all species of some common genus: at least\nsome philosophers have taken there to be a genus, awareness, of which\nthe various kinds of knowledge are all species, and with respect to\nwhich these various kinds may all be explained (see Silva 2019 for a\ndefense of \u201cawareness first\u201d epistemology).\n2.1 Knowing Individuals\n\nEven if you know many facts about Napoleon, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat you know Napoleon. You couldn\u2019t ever have known Napoleon,\nsince he died long before you were born. But, despite not having ever\nknown Napoleon, you could still know a great many facts about\nNapoleon\u2014perhaps you know even more facts about Napoleon than\ndid those who knew him most intimately. This shows that knowing a\nperson is not the same as knowing a great many facts about the person:\nthe latter is not sufficient for the former. And perhaps the former is\nnot even sufficient for the latter, since I might know my next door\nneighbor, and yet not realize that he is an undercover agent, and that\nalmost everything he tells me about himself is false.\n\nKnowing a person is a matter of being acquainted with that person, and\nacquaintance involves some kind of perceptual relation to the person.\nWhat kind of perceptual relation? Clearly, not just any perceptual\nrelation will do: I see and hear thousands of people while walking\naround a bustling city, but it doesn\u2019t follow that I am\nacquainted with any of them. Must acquaintance involve an ability to\ndistinguish that individual from others? It depends upon what such an\nability amounts to. I am acquainted with my next door neighbor, even\nthough, in some sense, I cannot distinguish him from his identical\ntwin: if they were together I couldn\u2019t tell who was who.\n\nJust as we can be acquainted with a person, so too can we be\nacquainted with a city, a species of bird, a planet, 1960s jazz music,\nWatson and Crick\u2019s research, transphobia, and so on. If\nit\u2019s not clear precisely what acquaintance demands in the case\nof people, it\u2019s even less clear what it demands across all of\nthese various cases. If there is a genus of cognitive success\nexpressed by the verb \u201cto know\u201d with a direct object, or\nby the French \u201cconnaitre\u201d, we have not yet understood that\ngenus.\n2.2 Knowing How\n\nIn his groundbreaking book, The Concept of Mind, Gilbert Ryle\nargued that knowing how to do something must be different from knowing\nany set of facts. No matter how many facts you might know about\nswimming, say, it doesn\u2019t follow from your knowledge of these\nfacts that you know how to swim. And, of course, you might know how to\nswim even without knowing very many facts about swimming. For Ryle,\nknowing how is fundamentally different from knowing\nthat.\n\nThis Rylean distinction between knowing how and knowing\nthat has been prominently challenged, beginning in 1975 with the\npublication of Carl Ginet\u2019s Knowledge, Perception, and\nMemory. Ginet argued that knowing how to do something was simply\nknowing that a particular act was a way to do that thing. This\nchallenge was extended and systematized by Bo\u00ebr and Lycan (1975),\nwho argued that knowing who, knowing which,\nknowing why, knowing where, knowing when,\nand knowing how\u2014all of the varieties of knowing\nwh-, as they called it\u2014were all just different forms of\nknowing that. To know who is F, for instance, was simply to\nknow that a particular person is F. To know why\np is simply to know that a particular thing is the reason\nwhy p. And to know how to F was simply to know\nthat a particular act is a way to F. This view was\nelaborated in considerable detail by Stanley and Williamson 2001, and\nthen challenged or refined by many subsequent writers (see, for\ninstance, the essays in Bengson and Moffett 2011, and also Pavese 2015\nand 2017).\n2.3 Knowing Facts\n\nWhenever a knower (S) knows some fact (p), several\nconditions must obtain. A proposition that S doesn\u2019t even\nbelieve cannot be, or express, a fact that S knows. Therefore,\nknowledge requires\n belief.[14]\n False propositions cannot be, or express, facts, and so cannot be\nknown. Therefore, knowledge requires truth. Finally, S\u2019s\nbeing correct in believing that p might merely be a matter of\nluck. For example, if Hal believes he has a fatal illness, not because\nhe was told so by his doctor, but solely because as a hypochondriac he\ncan\u2019t help believing it, and it turns out that in fact he has a\nfatal illness, Hal\u2019s being right about this is merely\naccidental: a matter of luck (bad luck, in this\n case).[15]\n Therefore, knowledge requires a third element, one that excludes the\naforementioned luck, and so that involves S\u2019s belief\nbeing, in some sense, justifiably or appropriately\nheld. If we take these three conditions on knowledge to be not merely\nnecessary but also sufficient, then: S knows that p if\nand only if p is true and S justifiably believes that\np. According to this account, the three conditions\u2014truth,\nbelief, and justification\u2014are individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient for knowledge of\n facts.[16]\n\nRecall that the justification condition is introduced to ensure that\nS\u2019s belief is not true merely because of luck. But what\nmust justification be, if it can ensure that? It may be thought that\nS\u2019s belief that p is true not merely because of\nluck when it is reasonable or rational, from S\u2019s own\npoint of view, to take p to be true. Or it may be thought that\nS\u2019s belief is true not merely because of luck if that\nbelief has a high objective probability of truth, that is, if it is\nformed or sustained by reliable cognitive processes or faculties. But,\nas we will see in the next section, if justification is understood in\neither of these ways, it cannot ensure against luck.\n\nIt turns out, as Edmund Gettier showed, that there are cases of JTB\nthat are not cases of knowledge. JTB, therefore, is not\nsufficient for knowledge. Cases like that\u2014known as\nGettier\n cases[17]\u2014arise\n because neither the possession of adequate evidence, nor origination\nin reliable faculties, nor the conjunction of these conditions, is\nsufficient for ensuring that a belief is not true merely because of\nluck. Consider the well-known case of barn-facades: Henry drives\nthrough a rural area in which what appear to be barns are, with the\nexception of just one, mere barn facades. From the road Henry is\ndriving on, these facades look exactly like real barns. Henry happens\nto be looking at the one and only real barn in the area and believes\nthat there\u2019s a barn over there. So Henry\u2019s belief is true,\nand furthermore his visual experience makes it reasonable, from his\npoint of view, to hold that belief. Finally, his belief originates in\na reliable cognitive process: normal vision of ordinary, recognizable\nobjects in good lighting. Yet Henry\u2019s belief is true in this\ncase merely because of luck: had Henry noticed one of the barn-facades\ninstead, his belief would have been false. There is, therefore, broad\nagreement among epistemologists that Henry\u2019s belief does not\nqualify as\n knowledge.[18]\n\n\nTo state conditions that are jointly sufficient for knowledge, what\nfurther element must be added to JTB? This is known as the Gettier\nproblem. Some philosophers attempt to solve the Gettier problem\nby adding a fourth condition to the three conditions mentioned above,\nwhile others attempt to solve it by either replacing or refining the\njustification condition. How we understand the contrast between\nreplacing the justification condition and refining it depends, of\ncourse, on how we understand the justification condition itself, which\nis the topic of the next section.\n\nSome philosophers reject the Gettier problem altogether: they reject\nthe aspiration to understand knowledge by trying to add to JTB. Some\nsuch philosophers try to explain knowledge in terms of virtues: they\nsay that to know a fact is for the truth of one\u2019s belief to\nmanifest epistemic virtue (see Zagzebski 1996 and Sosa 1997). Other\nsuch philosophers try to explain knowledge by identifying it as a\ngenus of many familiar species: they say that knowledge is the most\ngeneral factive mental state operator (see Williamson 2002). And still\nother such philosophers try to explain knowledge by explaining its\ndistinctive role in some other activity. According to some, to know a\nfact is for that fact to be a reason for which one can do or think\n something.[19]\n According to others, to know a fact is to be entitled to assert that\nfact (see Unger 1975, Williamson 2002, DeRose 2002 for defenses of\nthis view; see Brown 2008b and 2010 for dissent). According to still\nothers, to know a fact is to be entitled to use it as a premise in\nreasoning (see Hawthorne & Stanley 2008 for defense of this view;\nsee Neta 2009 and Brown 2008a for dissent). And according to still\nothers, to know a fact is to be a trustworthy informant concerning\nwhether that fact obtains. Finally, there are those who think that the\nquestion \u201cwhat is it to know a fact?\u201d is misconceived: the\nverb \u201cto know\u201d does not do the work of denoting anything,\nbut does a different kind of work altogether, for instance, the work\nof assuring one\u2019s listeners concerning some fact or other, or\nthe work of indicating to one\u2019s audience that a particular\nperson is a trustworthy informant concerning some matter (see Lawlor\n2013 for an articulation of the assurance view, and Craig 1990 for an\narticulation of the trustworthy informant view).\n3. What is Justification?\n\nWhatever precisely is involved in knowing a fact, it is widely\nrecognized that some of our cognitive successes fall short of\nknowledge: an agent may, for example, conduct herself in a way that is\nintellectually unimpeachable, and yet still end up thereby believing a\nfalse proposition. Julia has every reason to believe that her birthday\nis July 15: it says so on her birth certificate and all of her medical\nrecords, and everyone in her family insists that it is July 15.\nNonetheless, if all of this evidence is the result of some\ntime-keeping mistake made at the time of her birth, her belief about\nher birthday could be false, despite being so thoroughly justified.\nDebates concerning the nature of\n justification[20]\n can be understood as debates concerning the nature of such\nnon-knowledge-guaranteeing cognitive successes as the one that Julia\nenjoys in this\n example.[21]\n3.1 Deontological and Non-Deontological Justification\n\nHow is the term \u201cjustification\u201d used in ordinary language?\nHere is an example: Tom asked Martha a question, and Martha responded\nwith a lie. Was she justified in lying? Jane thinks she was, for\nTom\u2019s question was an inappropriate one, the answer to which was\nnone of Tom\u2019s business. What might Jane mean when she thinks\nthat Martha was justified in responding with a lie? A natural answer\nis this: She means that Martha was under no obligation to\nrefrain from lying. Due to the inappropriateness of Tom\u2019s\nquestion, it wasn\u2019t Martha\u2019s duty to tell the\ntruth. This understanding of justification, commonly labeled\ndeontological, may be defined as follows: S is\njustified in doing x if and only if S is not obliged to\nrefrain from doing\n x.[22]\n\nIf, when we apply the word justification not to actions but to\nbeliefs, we mean something analogous, then the following holds:\n\n\nDeontological Justification (DJ)\n\nS is justified in believing that p if and only if\nS is not obliged to refrain from believing that\n p.[23]\n\n\nWhat kind of obligations are relevant when we wish to assess whether a\nbelief, rather than an action, is justified or unjustified?\nWhereas when we evaluate an action, we are interested in assessing the\naction from either a moral or a prudential point of view, when it\ncomes to beliefs, what matters may be something\n else,[24]\n e.g., the pursuit of truth, or of understanding, or\nof knowledge.\n\nExactly what, though, must we do in the pursuit of some such\ndistinctively epistemic aim? According to one answer, the one favored\nby evidentialists, we ought to believe in accord with our\n evidence.[25]\n For this answer to be helpful, we need an account of what our\nevidence consists of, and what it means to believe in accord with it.\nOther philosophers might deny this evidentialist answer, but still say\nthat the pursuit of the distinctively epistemic aims entails that we\nought to follow the correct epistemic norms. If this answer is going\nto help us figure out what obligations the distinctively epistemic\naims impose on us, we need to be given an account of what the correct\nepistemic norms\n are.][26]\n\nThe deontological understanding of the concept of justification is\ncommon to the way philosophers such as Descartes, Locke, Moore and\nChisholm have thought about justification. Recently, however, two\nchief objections have been raised against conceiving of justification\ndeontologically. First, it has been argued that DJ presupposes that we\ncan have a sufficiently high degree of control over our beliefs. But\nbeliefs\u2014this objection alleges\u2014are akin not to actions but\nrather things such as digestive processes, sneezes, or involuntary\nblinkings of the eye. The idea is that beliefs simply arise in or\nhappen to us. Therefore, beliefs are not suitable for deontological\nevaluation (see Alston 1985 & 1988; also, see Chrisman 2008). To\nthis objection, some advocates of DJ have replied that lack of control\nover our beliefs is no obstacle to thinking of justification as a\ndeontological status (see R. Feldman 2001a). Other advocates of DJ\nhave argued that we enjoy no less control over our beliefs than we do\nover our intentional actions (see Ryan 2003; Sosa 2015; Steup 2000,\n2008, 2012, 2017; and Rinard 2019b).\n\nAccording to the second objection to DJ, deontological justification\ncannot suffice for an agent to have a justified belief. This claim is\ntypically supported by describing cases involving either a benighted,\nculturally isolated society or subjects who are cognitively deficient.\nSuch cases involve subjects whose cognitive limitations make it the\ncase that they are under no obligation to refrain from believing as\nthey do, but whose limitations nonetheless render them incapable of\nforming justified beliefs (for a response to this objection, see Steup\n1999).\n\nThose who reject DJ think of justification not deontologically, but\nrather as a property that that a belief has when it is, in some sense,\nsufficiently likely to be\n true.[27]\n We may, then, define justification as follows:\n\n\nSufficient Likelihood Justification (SLJ)\n\nS is justified in believing that p if and only if\nS believes that p in a way that makes it sufficiently\nlikely that her belief is true.\n\n\nIf we wish to pin down exactly what the likelihood at issue amounts\nto, we will have to deal with a variety of tricky\n issues.[28]\n For now, let us just focus on the main point. Those who prefer SLJ to\nDJ would say that sufficient likelihood of truth and deontological\njustification can diverge: it\u2019s possible for a belief to be\ndeontologically justified without being sufficiently likely to be\ntrue. This is just what cases involving benighted cultures or\ncognitively deficient subjects are designed to show (for elaboration\non the non-deontological concept of justification, see Alston\n1988).\n3.2 What Justifies Belief?\n\nWhat makes a belief that p justified, when it is? Whether a\nbelief is justified or unjustified, there is something that\nmakes it so. Let\u2019s call the things that make a belief\njustified or unjustified J-factors. Which features of a belief are\nJ-factors?\n\nAccording to \u201cevidentialists\u201d, it is the believer\u2019s\npossession of evidence for p. What is it, though, to possess\nevidence for p? Some evidentialists (though not all) would say\nit is to be in an experience that presents p as being true.\nAccording to these evidentialists, if the coffee in your cup tastes\nsweet to you, then you have evidence that the coffee is sweet. If you\nfeel a throbbing pain in your head, you have evidence that you have a\nheadache. If you have a memory of having had cereal for breakfast,\nthen you have evidence about what you had for breakfast. And when you\nclearly \u201csee\u201d or \u201cintuit\u201d that the proposition\n\u201cIf Jack had more than four cups of coffee, then Jack had more\nthan three cups of coffee\u201d is true, then you have evidence for\nthat proposition. On this view, evidence consists of perceptual,\nintrospective, memorial, and intuitional experiences, and to possess\nevidence is to have an experience of that kind. So according to this\n\u201cexperientialist\u201d version of evidentialism, what makes you\njustified in believing that p is your having an experience that\nrepresents p as being true (see Conee and Feldman 2008 and\nMcCain 2014 for defenses of such a view). Other versions of\nevidentialism might identify other factors as your evidence, but would\nstill insist that those factors are the J-factors.\n\nEvidentialism is often contrasted with reliabilism, which is the view\nthat a belief is justified by resulting from a reliable source, where\na source is reliable just in case it tends to result in mostly true\nbeliefs. Reliabilists, of course, can also grant that the experiences\nmentioned in the previous paragraph can matter to the justification of\nyour beliefs. However, they deny that justification is\nessentially a matter of having suitable experiences. Rather,\nthey say, those experiences matter to the justification of your\nbeliefs not merely by virtue of being evidence in support of those\nbeliefs, but more fundamentally, by virtue of being part of the\nreliable source of those beliefs. Different versions of reliabilism\nhave been defended: some philosophers claim that what justifies a\nbelief is that it is produced by a process that is reliable (for\ninstance, see Goldman 1986), others claim that what justifies a belief\nis that it is responsive to grounds that reliably covary with the\ntruth of that belief, other claim that what justifies a belief is that\nit is formed by the virtuous exercise of a capacity, and so on.\n3.3 Internal vs. External\n\nConsider a science fiction scenario concerning a human brain that is\nremoved from its skull, kept alive in a vat of nutrient fluid, and\nelectrochemically stimulated to have precisely the same total series\nof experiences that you have had. Call such a brain a\n\u201cBIV\u201d: a BIV would believe everything that you believe,\nand would (it is often thought) be justified in believing those things\nto precisely the same extent that you are justified in believing them.\nTherefore, justification is determined solely by those internal\nfactors that you and your envatted brain doppelganger share. This view\nis what has come to be called \u201cinternalism\u201d about\n justification.[29]\n\nExternalism is simply the denial of internalism. Externalists say that\nwhat we want from justification is the kind of likelihood of truth\nneeded for knowledge, and the internal conditions that you share with\nyour BIV doppelganger do not generate such likelihood of truth. So\njustification involves external\n conditions.[30]\n\nAmong those who think that justification is internal, there is no\nunanimity on how to understand the notion of internality\u2014i.e.,\nwhat it is about the factors that you share with your BIV doppelganger\nthat makes those factors relevant to justification. We can distinguish\nbetween two approaches. According to the first, justification is\ninternal because we enjoy a special kind of access to J-factors: they\nare always recognizable on\n reflection.[31]\n Hence, assuming certain further premises (which will be mentioned\nmomentarily), justification itself is always recognizable on\n reflection.[32]\n According to the second approach, justification is internal because\nJ-factors are always mental states (see Conee and Feldman 2001).\nLet\u2019s call the former accessibility internalism and the\nlatter mentalist internalism.\n\nEvidentialism is typically associated with internalism of at least one\nof these two varieties, and reliabilism with\n externalism.[33]\n Let us see why. Evidentialism says, at a minimum, two things:\n\nE1 What makes\none justified in believing p is nothing over and above the\nevidence that one possesses.\nE2 What\nevidence one possesses is fixed by one\u2019s mental\nstates.\n\n\nBy virtue of E2, evidentialism is an instance of mentalist\ninternalism. Whether evidentialism is also an instance of\naccessibility internalism is a more complicated issue. The conjunction\nof E1 and E2 by itself implies nothing about the accessibility of\njustification. But mentalist internalists who endorse the first\nprinciple below will also be committed to accessibility internalism,\nand evidentialists who also endorse the second principle below will be\ncommitted to the accessibility of justification:\n\n\nLuminosity\n\nOne\u2019s own mind is cognitively luminous: Whenever one is in a\nparticular mental state, one can always recognize on reflection what\nmental states one is in, and in particular, one can always recognize\non reflection what evidence one\n possesses.[34]\n\nNecessity\n\nThe principles that determine what is evidence for what are\na priori\n recognizable.[35]\n Relying on a priori insight, one can therefore always\nrecognize on reflection whether, or the extent, to which a particular\nbody of evidence is evidence for\n p.[36]\n\n\nAlthough E1 and E2 by themselves do not imply access internalism,\ntheir conjunction with Luminosity and Necessity may imply access\n internalism.[37]\n\nNext, let us consider why reliabilism is an externalist theory.\nReliabilism says that the justification of one\u2019s beliefs is a\nfunction of the reliability of one\u2019s belief sources such as\nmemorial, perceptual and introspective states and processes. Even if\nthe operations of the sources are mental states, their reliability is\nnot itself be a mental state. Therefore, reliabilists reject mentalist\ninternalism. Moreover, insofar as the reliability of one\u2019s\nbelief sources is not itself recognizable by means of reflection, how\ncould reflection enable us to recognize when such justification\n obtains?[38]\n Reliabilists who take there to be no good answer to this question\nalso reject access\n internalism.[39]\n4. The Structure of Knowledge and Justification\n\nAnyone who knows anything necessarily knows many things. Our knowledge\nforms a body, and that body has a structure: knowing some things\nrequires knowing other things. But what is this structure?\nEpistemologists who think that knowledge involves justification tend\nto regard the structure of our knowledge as deriving from the\nstructure of our justifications. We will, therefore, focus on the\nlatter.\n4.1 Foundationalism\n\nAccording to foundationalism, our justified beliefs are structured\nlike a building: they are divided into a foundation and a\nsuperstructure, the latter resting upon the former. Beliefs belonging\nto the foundation are basic. Beliefs belonging to the\nsuperstructure are nonbasic and receive justification from\nthe justified beliefs in the\n foundation.[40]\n\nBefore we evaluate this foundationalist account of justification, let\nus first try to spell it out more precisely. What is it for a\njustified belief to be basic? According to one approach, what makes a\njustified belief basic is that it doesn\u2019t receive its\njustification from any other beliefs. The following definition\ncaptures this thought:\n\n\nDoxastic Basicality (DB)\n\nS\u2019s justified belief that p is basic if and only\nif S\u2019s belief that p is justified without owing\nits justification to any of S\u2019s other beliefs.\n\n\nLet\u2019s consider what would, according to DB, qualify as an\nexample of a basic belief. Suppose you notice (for whatever reason)\nsomeone\u2019s hat, and you also notice that that hat looks blue to\nyou. So you believe\n\n(B) It appears\nto me that that hat is blue.\n\n\nUnless something very strange is going on, (B) is an example of a\njustified belief. DB tells us that (B) is basic if and only if it does\nnot owe its justification to any other beliefs of yours. So if (B) is\nindeed basic, there might be some item or other to which (B) owes its\njustification, but that item would not be another belief of yours. We\ncall this kind of basicality \u201cdoxastic\u201d because it makes\nbasicality a function of how your doxastic system (your belief system)\nis structured.\n\nLet us turn to the question of where the justification that attaches\nto (B) might come from, if we think of basicality as defined by DB.\nNote that DB merely tells us how (B) is not justified. It\nsays nothing about how (B) is justified. DB, therefore, does\nnot answer that question. What we need, in addition to DB, is an\naccount of what it is that justifies a belief such as (B).\nAccording to one strand of foundationalist thought, (B) is justified\nbecause it can\u2019t be false, doubted, or corrected by others. On\nsuch a view, (B) is justified because (B) carries with it an\nepistemic privilege such as infallibility, indubitability, or\nincorrigibility (for a discussion of various kinds of epistemic\nprivilege, see Alston 1971 [1989]).\n\nNote that (B) is a belief about how the hat appears to you.\nSo (B) is a belief about a perceptual experience of yours. According\nto the version of foundationalism just considered, a subject\u2019s\nbasic beliefs are introspective beliefs about the subject\u2019s own\nmental states, of which perceptual experiences make up one subset.\nOther mental states about which a subject can have basic beliefs may\ninclude such things as having a headache, being tired, feeling\npleasure, or having a desire for a cup of coffee. Beliefs about\nexternal objects cannot qualify as basic, according to this kind of\nfoundationalism, for it is impossible for such beliefs to enjoy the\nkind of epistemic privilege necessary for being basic.\n\nAccording to a different version of foundationalism, (B) is justified\nby some further mental state of yours, but not by a further\nbelief of yours. Rather, (B) is justified by the very\nperceptual experience that (B) itself is about: the\nhat\u2019s looking blue to you. Let \u201c(E)\u201d represent that\nexperience. According to this alternative proposal, (B) and (E) are\ndistinct mental states. The idea is that what justifies (B) is (E).\nSince (E) is an experience, not a belief of yours, (B) can, according\nto DB, still be basic.\n\nLet\u2019s call the two versions of foundationalism we have\ndistinguished privilege foundationalism and experiential\nfoundationalism. Privilege foundationalism is generally thought\nto restrict basic beliefs so that beliefs about contingent,\nmind-independent facts cannot be basic, since beliefs about such facts\nare generally thought to lack the privilege that attends our\nintrospective beliefs about our own present mental states, or our\nbeliefs about a priori necessities. Experiential\nfoundationalism is not restrictive in the same way. Suppose instead of\n(B), you believe\n\n(H) That hat\nis blue.\n\n\nUnlike (B), (H) is about the hat itself, and not the way the hat\nappears to you. Such a belief is not one about which we are infallible\nor otherwise epistemically privileged. Privilege foundationalism\nwould, therefore, classify (H) as nonbasic. It is, however, quite\nplausible to think that (E) justifies not only (B) but (H) as well. If\n(E) is indeed what justifies (H), and (H) does not receive any\nadditional justification from any further beliefs of yours, then (H)\nqualifies, according to DB, as basic.\n\nExperiential Foundationalism, then, combines two crucial ideas: (i)\nwhen a justified belief is basic, its justification is not owed to any\nother belief; (ii) what in fact justifies basic beliefs are\nexperiences.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances, perceptual beliefs such as (H) are not\nbased on any further beliefs about one\u2019s own perceptual\nexperiences. It is not clear, therefore, how privilege foundationalism\ncan account for the justification of ordinary perceptual beliefs like\n (H).[41]\n Experiential foundationalism, on the other hand, has no trouble at\nall explaining how ordinary perceptual beliefs are justified: they are\njustified by the perceptual experiences that give rise to them. This\ncould be viewed as a reason for preferring experiential\nfoundationalism to privilege foundationalism.\n\nDB articulates one conception of basicality. Here\u2019s an\nalternative conception:\n\n\nEpistemic Basicality (EB)\n\nS\u2019s justified belief that p is basic if and only\nif S\u2019s justification for believing that p does not\ndepend on any justification S possesses for believing a further\nproposition,\n q.[42]\n\n\nEB makes it more difficult for a belief to be basic than DB does. To\nsee why, we turn to the chief question (let\u2019s call it the\n\u201cJ-question\u201d) that advocates of experiential\nfoundationalism face:\n\n\nThe J-Question\n\nWhy are perceptual experiences a source of justification?\n\n\nOne way of answering the J-question is as follows: perceptual\nexperiences are a source of justification only when, and only because,\nwe have justification for taking them to be\n reliable.[43]\n Note that your having justification for believing that p\ndoesn\u2019t entail that you actually believe p. Thus, your\nhaving justification for attributing reliability to your perceptual\nexperiences doesn\u2019t entail that you actually believe them to be\nreliable.\n\nWhat might give us justification for thinking that our perceptual\nexperiences are reliable? That\u2019s a complicated issue. For our\npresent purposes, let\u2019s consider the following answer: We\nremember that they have served us well in the past. We are supposing,\nthen, that justification for attributing reliability to your\nperceptual experiences consists of memories of perceptual success. On\nthis view, a perceptual experience (E) justifies a perceptual belief\nonly when, and only because, you have suitable track-record memories\nthat give you justification for considering (E) reliable. (Of course,\nthis raises the question why those memories give us justification, but\nthere are many different approaches to this question, as we\u2019ll\nsee more fully below.)\n\nIf this view is correct, then it is clear how DB and EB differ. Your\nhaving justification for (H) depends on your having justification for\nbelieving something else in addition to (H), namely that your visual\nexperiences are reliable. As a result (H) is not basic in the sense\ndefined by EB. However, (H) might still be basic in the sense defined\nby DB. If you are justified in believing (H) and your justification is\nowed solely to (E) and (M), neither of which includes any beliefs,\nthen your belief is doxastically\u2014though not\nepistemically\u2014basic. \n\nWe\u2019ve considered one possible answer to the J-question, and\nconsidered how EB and DB differ if that answer is correct. But there\nare other possible answers to the J-question. Another answer is that\nperceptual experiences are a source of justification when, and\nbecause, they are of types that reliably produce true\n beliefs.[44]\n Another answer is that perceptual experiences are a source of\njustification when, and because, they are of types that reliably\nindicate the truth of their content. Yet another answer is that\nperceptual experiences are a source of justification when, and\nbecause, they have a certain phenomenology: that of presenting their\ncontent as\n true.[45]\n\nTo conclude this section, let us briefly consider how justification is\nsupposed to be transferred from basic to nonbasic beliefs. There are\ntwo options: the justificatory relation between basic and nonbasic\nbeliefs could be deductive or non-deductive. If we take the relation\nto be deductive, each of one\u2019s nonbasic beliefs would have to be\nsuch that it can be deduced from one\u2019s basic beliefs. But if we\nconsider a random selection of typical beliefs we hold, it is not easy\nto see from which basic beliefs they could be deduced.\nFoundationalists, therefore, typically conceive of the link between\nthe foundation and the superstructure in non-deductive terms. They\nwould say that, for a given set of basic beliefs, B, to justify a\nnonbasic belief, B*, it isn\u2019t necessary that B entails B*.\nRather, it is sufficient that, the inference from B to B* is a\nrational one\u2014however such rationality is to be\n understood.[46]\n4.2 Coherentism\n\nFoundationalism says that knowledge and justification are structured\nlike a building, consisting of a superstructure that rests upon a\nfoundation. According to coherentism, this metaphor gets things wrong.\nKnowledge and justification are structured like a web where\nthe strength of any given area depends on the strength of the\nsurrounding areas. Coherentists, then, deny that there are any basic\nbeliefs. As we saw in the previous section, there are two different\nways of conceiving of basicality. Consequently, there are two\ncorresponding ways of construing coherentism: as the denial of\ndoxastic basicality or as the denial of epistemic basicality. Consider\nfirst coherentism as the denial of doxastic basicality:\n\n\nDoxastic Coherentism\n\nEvery justified belief receives its justification from other beliefs\nin its epistemic neighborhood.\n\n\nLet us apply this thought to the hat example we considered in\n Section 3.1.\n Suppose again you notice someone\u2019s hat and believe\n\n(H) That hat is\nblue.\n\n\nLet\u2019s agree that (H) is justified. According to coherentism, (H)\nreceives its justification from other beliefs in the epistemic\nvicinity of (H). They constitute your evidence or your reasons for\ntaking (H) to be true. Which beliefs might make up this set of\njustification-conferring neighborhood beliefs?\n\nWe will consider two approaches to answering this question. The first\nis known as inference to the best explanation. Such\ninferences generate what is called explanatory coherence (see\nchapter 7 in Harman 1986). According to this approach, we must suppose\nyou form a belief about the way the hat appears to you in your\nperceptual experiences, and a second belief to the effect that your\nperceptual experience, the hat\u2019s looking blue to you, is best\nexplained by the hypothesis that (H) is true. So the relevant set of\nbeliefs is the following:\n\n(1) I am\nhaving a visual experience (E): the hat looks blue to me.\n(2) My having\n(E) is best explained by assuming that (H) is true.\n\n\nThere are of course alternative explanations of why you have (E).\nPerhaps you are hallucinating that the hat is blue. Perhaps an evil\ndemon makes the hat look blue to you when in fact it is red. Perhaps\nyou are the sort of person to whom hats always look blue. An\nexplanatory coherentist would say that, compared with these, the\nhat\u2019s actual blueness is a superior explanation. That\u2019s\nwhy you are justified in believing (H). Note that an explanatory\ncoherentist can also explain the lack of justification.\nSuppose you remember that you just took a hallucinatory drug that\nmakes things look blue to you. That would prevent you from being\njustified in believing (H). The explanatory coherentist can account\nfor this by pointing out that, in the case we are considering now, the\ntruth of (H) would not be the best explanation of why you are\nhaving experience (E). Rather, your having taken the hallucinatory\ndrug would explain your having (E) at least as well as the hypothesis\n(H) would explain it. That\u2019s why, according to the explanatory\ncoherentist, in this variation of our original case you are not\njustified in believing (H).\n\nOne challenge for explanatory coherentists is to explain what makes\none explanation better than another. Let\u2019s use the evil demon\nhypothesis to illustrate this challenge. What we need is an\nexplanation of why you are having (E). According to the evil demon\nhypothesis, you are having (E) because the evil demon is causing you\nto have (E), in order to trick you. The explanatory coherentist would\nsay that, if the bulk of our beliefs about the mind-independent world\nare justified, then this \u201cevil demon\u201d hypothesis is a bad\nexplanation of why you are having (E). But why is it bad? What we need\nto answer this question is a general and principled account of what\nmakes one explanation better than another. Suppose we appeal to the\nfact that you are not justified in believing in the existence\nof evil demons. The general idea would be this: If there are two\ncompeting explanations, E1 and E2, and E1 consists of or includes a\nproposition that you are not justified in believing whereas E2 does\nnot, then E2 is better than E1. The problem with this idea is that it\nputs the cart before the horse. Explanatory coherentism is supposed to\nhelp us understand what it is for beliefs to be justified. It\ndoesn\u2019t do that if it accounts for the difference between better\nand worse explanations by making use of the difference between\njustified and unjustified belief. If explanatory coherentism were to\nproceed in this way, it would be a circular, and thus uninformative,\naccount of justification. So the challenge that explanatory\ncoherentism must meet is to give an account, without using the concept\nof justification, of what makes one explanation better than\nanother.\n\nLet us move on to the second way in which the coherentist approach\nmight be carried out. Recall what a subject\u2019s justification for\nbelieving p is all about: possessing a link between the belief\nthat p and p\u2019s truth. Suppose the subject knows\nthat the origin of her belief that p is reliable. So she knows\nthat beliefs coming from this source tend to be true. Such knowledge\nwould give her an excellent link between the belief and its truth. So\nwe might say that the neighborhood beliefs which confer justification\non (H) are the following:\n\n(1) I am having a\nvisual experience (E): the hat looks blue to me. \n(3)Experiences\nlike (E) are reliable.\n\n\nCall coherentism of this kind reliability coherentism. If you\nbelieve (1) and (3), you are in possession of a good reason for\nthinking that the hat is indeed blue. So you are in possession of a\ngood reason for thinking that the belief in question, (H), is true.\nThat\u2019s why, according to reliability coherentism, you are\njustified in believing (H).\n\nLike explanatory coherentism, this view faces a circularity problem.\nIf (H) receives its justification in part because you also believe\n(3), (3) itself must be justified. But where would your justification\nfor (3) come from? One answer would be: from your memory of perceptual\nsuccess in the past. You remember that your visual experiences have\nhad a good track record. They have rarely led you astray. The problem\nis that you can\u2019t justifiably attribute a good track record to\nyour perceptual faculties without using your perceptual faculties. So\nif reliability coherentism is going to work, it would have to be\nlegitimate to use a faculty for the very purpose of establishing the\nreliability of that faculty itself. But it is not clear that this is\n legitimate.[47]\n\nWe have seen that explanatory coherentism and reliability coherentism\neach face its own distinctive circularity problem. Since both are\nversions of doxastic coherentism, they both face a further\ndifficulty: Do people, under normal circumstances, really form beliefs\nlike (1), (2), and (3)? It would seem they do not. It could be\nobjected, therefore, that these two versions of coherentism make\nexcessive intellectual demands of ordinary subjects who are unlikely\nto have the background beliefs that, according to these versions of\ncoherentism, are needed for justification. This objection could be\navoided by stripping coherentism of its doxastic element. The result\nwould be the following version of coherentism, which results from\nrejecting EB (the epistemic conception of basicality):\n\n\nDependence Coherentism\n\nWhenever one is justified in believing a proposition\np1, one\u2019s justification for believing\np1 depends on justification one has for believing\nsome further propositions, p1, p2,\n\u2026 pn.\n\n\nAn explanatory coherentist might say that, for you to be justified in\nbelieving (H), it\u2019s not necessary that you actually\nbelieve\n(1)\n and\n (2).\n However, it is necessary that you have justification for\nbelieving (1) and (2). It is your having justification for (1) and (2)\nthat gives you justification for believing (H). A reliability\ncoherentist might make an analogous point. She might say that, to be\njustified in believing (H), you need not believe anything about the\nreliability of your belief\u2019s origin. You must, however, have\njustification for believing that your belief\u2019s origin is\nreliable; that is, you must have justification for (1) and\n (3).\n Both versions of dependence coherentism, then, rest on the\nsupposition that it is possible to have justification for a\nproposition without actually believing that proposition.\n\nDependence coherentism is a significant departure from the way\ncoherentism has typically been construed by its advocates. According\nto the typical construal of coherentism, a belief is justified, only\nif the subject has certain further beliefs that constitute\nreasons for the given belief. Dependence coherentism rejects this.\nAccording to it, justification need not come in the form of beliefs.\nIt can come in the form of introspective and memorial experience, so\nlong as such experience gives a subject justification for beliefs\nabout either reliability or explanatory coherence. In fact, dependence\ncoherentism allows for the possibility that a belief is justified, not\nby receiving any of its justification from other beliefs, but\nsolely by suitable perceptual experiences and memory\n experience.[48]\n\nNext, let us examine some of the reasons provided in the debate over\nfoundationalism and coherentism.\n4.3 Why Foundationalism?\n\nThe main argument for foundationalism is called the regress\nargument. It\u2019s an argument from elimination. With regard to\nevery justified belief, B1, the question arises of where\nB1\u2019s justification comes from. If B1 is\nnot basic, it would have to come from another belief, B2.\nBut B2 can justify B1 only if B2 is\njustified itself. If B2 is basic, the justificatory chain\nwould end with B2. But if B2 is not basic, we\nneed a further belief, B3. If B3 is not basic,\nwe need a fourth belief, and so forth. Unless the ensuing regress\nterminates in a basic belief, we get two possibilities: the regress\nwill either loop back to B1 or continue ad\ninfinitum. According to the regress argument, both of these\npossibilities are unacceptable. Therefore, if there are justified\nbeliefs, there must be basic\n beliefs.[49]\n\nThis argument suffers from various weaknesses. First, we may wonder\nwhether the alternatives to foundationalism are really unacceptable.\nIn the recent literature on this subject, we actually find an\nelaborate defense of the position that infinitism is the correct\nsolution to the regress\n problem.[50]\n Nor should circularity be dismissed too quickly. The issue is not\nwhether a simple argument of the form p therefore p can\njustify the belief that p. Of course it cannot. Rather, the\nissue is ultimately whether, in the attempt to show that trust in our\nfaculties is reasonable, we may make use of the input our faculties\ndeliver. Whether such circularity is as unacceptable as a\np-therefore-p inference is an open question. Moreover, the\navoidance of circularity does not come cheap. Experiential\nfoundationalists claim that perception is a source of justification.\nHence they need to answer the J-question: Why is perception a\nsource of justification? As we saw above, if we wish to answer this\nquestion without committing ourselves to the kind of circularity\ndependence coherentism involves, we must choose between externalism\nand an appeal to brute necessity.\n\nThe second weakness of the regress argument is that its conclusion\nmerely says this: If there are justified beliefs, there must be\njustified beliefs that do not receive their justification from other\nbeliefs. Its conclusion does not say that, if there are justified\nbeliefs, there must be beliefs whose justification is independent of\nany justification for further beliefs. So the regress argument, if it\nwere sound, would merely show that there must be doxastic\nbasicality. Dependence coherentism, however, allows for doxastic\nbasicality. So the regress argument merely defends experiential\nfoundationalism against doxastic coherentism. It does not tell us why\nwe should prefer experiential foundationalism to dependence\ncoherentism.\n\nExperiential foundationalism can be supported by citing cases like the\nblue hat example. Such examples make it plausible to assume that\nperceptual experiences are a source of justification. But they do not\narbitrate between dependence coherentism and experiential\nfoundationalism, since both of those views appeal to perceptual\nexperiences to explain why perceptual beliefs are justified.\n\nFinally, foundationalism can be supported by advancing objections to\ncoherentism. One prominent objection is that coherentism somehow fails\nto ensure that a justified belief system is in contact with reality.\nThis objection derives its force from the fact that fiction can be\nperfectly coherent. Why think, therefore, that a belief system\u2019s\ncoherence is a reason for thinking that the beliefs in that system\ntend to be true? Coherentists could respond to this objection by\nsaying that, if a belief system contains beliefs such as \u201cMany\nof my beliefs have their origin in perceptual experiences\u201d and\n\u201cMy perceptual experiences are reliable\u201d, it is reasonable\nfor the subject to think that her belief system brings her into\ncontact with external reality. This looks like an effective response\nto the no-contact-with-reality objection. Moreover, it is not easy to\nsee why foundationalism itself should be better positioned than\ncoherentism when contact with reality is the issue. What is meant by\n\u201censuring\u201d contact with reality? If foundationalists\nexpect a logical guarantee of such contact, basic beliefs\nmust be infallible. That would make contact with reality a rather\nexpensive commodity. Given its price, foundationalists might want to\nlower their expectations. According to an alternative construal, we\nexpect merely the likelihood of contact with reality. But if\ncoherentists account for the epistemic value of perception in any way,\nthen they can meet that expectation as well as foundationalists\ncan.\n\nSince coherentism can be construed in different ways, it is unlikely\nthat there is one single objection that succeeds in refuting all\npossible versions of coherentism. Doxastic coherentism, however, seems\nparticularly vulnerable to criticism coming from the foundationalist\ncamp. One of these we considered already: It would seem that doxastic\ncoherentism makes excessive intellectual demands on believers. When\ndealing with the mundane tasks of everyday life, we don\u2019t\nnormally bother to form beliefs about the explanatory coherence of our\nbeliefs or the reliability of our belief sources. According to a\nsecond objection, doxastic coherentism fails by being insensitive to\nthe epistemic relevance of perceptual experiences. Foundationalists\ncould argue as follows. Suppose Kim is observing a chameleon that\nrapidly changes its colors. A moment ago it was blue, now it\u2019s\npurple. Kim still believes it\u2019s blue. Her belief is now\nunjustified because she believes the chameleon is blue even though it\nlooks purple to her. Then the chameleon changes its color\nback to blue. Now Kim\u2019s belief that the chameleon is blue is\njustified again because the chameleon once again looks blue\nto her. The point would be that what\u2019s responsible for the\nchanging justificatory status of Kim\u2019s belief is solely the way\nthe chameleon looks to her. Since doxastic coherentism does not\nattribute epistemic relevance to perceptual experiences by themselves,\nit cannot explain why Kim\u2019s belief is first justified, then\nunjustified, and eventually justified\n again.[51]\n4.4 Why Coherentism?\n\nCoherentism is typically defended by attacking foundationalism as a\nviable alternative. To argue against privilege foundationalism,\ncoherentists pick an epistemic privilege they think is essential to\nfoundationalism, and then argue that either no beliefs, or too few\nbeliefs, enjoy such a privilege. Against experiential foundationalism,\ndifferent objections have been advanced. One line of criticism is that\nperceptual experiences don\u2019t have propositional content.\nTherefore, the relation between a perceptual belief and the perceptual\nexperience that gives rise to it can only be causal. But it is not\nclear that this is correct. When you see the hat and it looks blue to\nyou, doesn\u2019t your visual experience\u2014its looking blue to\nyou\u2014have the propositional content that the hat is\nblue? If it does, then why not allow that your perceptual\nexperience can play a justificatory\n role?[52]\n\nAnother line of thought is that, if perceptual experiences have\npropositional content, they cannot stop the justificatory regress\nbecause they would then be in need of justification themselves. That,\nhowever, is a strange thought. In our actual epistemic practice, we\nnever demand of others to justify the way things appear to them in\ntheir perceptual experiences. Indeed, such a demand would seem absurd.\nSuppose I ask you: \u201cWhy do you think that the hat is\nblue?\u201d You answer: \u201cBecause it looks blue to me\u201d.\nThere are sensible further questions I might ask at that point. For\ninstance, I might ask: \u201cWhy do you think its looking blue to you\ngives you a reason for believing it is blue?\u201d Or I might ask:\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t you be mistaken in believing it looks blue to\nyou?\u201d But now suppose I ask you: \u201cWhy do you suppose the\nperceptual experience in which the hat looks blue to you is\njustified?\u201d In response to that question, you should accuse me\nof misusing the word \u201cjustification\u201d. I might as well ask\nyou what it is that justifies your headache when you have one, or what\njustifies the itch in your nose when you have one. The latter\nquestions, you should reply, would be as absurd as my request for\nstating a justifying reason for your perceptual\n experience.[53]\n\nExperiential foundationalism, then, is not easily dislodged. On what\ngrounds could coherentists object to it? To raise problems for\nexperiential foundationalism, coherentists could press the J-question:\nWhy are perceptual experiences a source of justification? If\nfoundationalists answer the J-question appealing to evidence that\nwarrants the attribution of reliability to perceptual experiences,\nexperiential foundationalism morphs into dependence coherentism. To\navoid this outcome, foundationalists would have to give an alternative\nanswer. One way of doing this would be to adopt the epistemic\nconception of basicality, and view it as a matter of brute necessity\nthat perception is a source of justification. It remains to be seen\nwhether such a view is sustainable.\n5. Sources of Knowledge and Justification\n\nBeliefs arise in people for a wide variety of causes. Among them, we\nmust list psychological factors such as desires, emotional needs,\nprejudice, and biases of various kinds. Obviously, when beliefs\noriginate in sources like these, they don\u2019t qualify as knowledge\neven if true. For true beliefs to count as knowledge, it is necessary\nthat they originate in sources we have good reason to consider\nreliable. These are perception, introspection, memory, reason, and\ntestimony. Let us briefly consider each of these.\n5.1 Perception\n\nOur perceptual faculties include at least our five senses: sight,\ntouch, hearing, smelling, and tasting. We must distinguish between an\nexperience that can be classified as perceiving that p\n(for example, seeing that there is coffee in the cup and tasting that\nit is sweet), which entails that p is true, and a perceptual\nexperience in which it seems to us as though p, but where\np might be false. Let us refer to this latter kind of\nexperience as perceptual seemings. The reason for making this\ndistinction lies in the fact that perceptual experience is fallible.\nThe world is not always as it appears to us in our perceptual\nexperiences. We need, therefore, a way of referring to perceptual\nexperiences in which p seems to be the case that allows for the\npossibility of p being false. That\u2019s the role assigned to\nperceptual seemings. So some perceptual seemings that p are\ncases of perceiving that p, others are not. When it looks to\nyou as though there is a cup of coffee on the table and in fact there\nis, the two states coincide. If, however, you hallucinate that there\nis a cup on the table, you have a perceptual seeming that p\nwithout perceiving that p.\n\nOne family of epistemological issues about perception arises when we\nconcern ourselves with the psychological nature of the perceptual\nprocesses through which we acquire knowledge of external objects.\nAccording to direct realism, we can acquire such knowledge\nbecause we can directly perceive such objects. For example, when you\nsee a tomato on the table, what you perceive is the tomato\nitself. According to indirect realism, we acquire knowledge\nof external objects by virtue of perceiving something else, namely\nappearances or sense-data. An indirect realist would say that, when\nyou see and thus know that there is a tomato on the table, what you\nreally see is not the tomato itself but a tomato-like sense-datum or\nsome such entity.\n\nDirect and indirect realists hold different views about the structure\nof perceptual knowledge. Indirect realists would say that we acquire\nperceptual knowledge of external objects by virtue of perceiving sense\ndata that represent external objects. Sense data enjoy a special\nstatus: we know directly what they are like. So indirect realists\nthink that, when perceptual knowledge is foundational, it is knowledge\nof sense data and other mental states. Knowledge of external objects\nis indirect: derived from our knowledge of sense data. The basic idea\nis that we have indirect knowledge of the external world because we\ncan have foundational knowledge of our own mind. Direct realists, in\ncontrast, say that perceptual experiences can give you direct,\nfoundational knowledge of external\n objects.[54]\n\nWe take our perceptual faculties to be reliable. But how can we know\nthat they are reliable? For externalists, this might not be much of a\nchallenge. If the use of reliable faculties is sufficient for\nknowledge, and if by using reliable faculties we acquire the belief\nthat our faculties are reliable, then we come to know that our\nfaculties are reliable. But even externalists might wonder how they\ncan, via argument, show that our perceptual faculties are\nreliable. The problem is this. It would seem the only way of acquiring\nknowledge about the reliability of our perceptual faculties is through\nmemory, through remembering whether they served us well in the past.\nBut should I trust my memory, and should I think that the episodes of\nperceptual success that I seem to recall were in fact episodes of\nperceptual success? If I am entitled to answer these questions with\n\u201cyes\u201d, then I need to have, to begin with, reason to view\nmy memory and my perceptual experiences as reliable. It would seem,\ntherefore, that there is no non-circular way of arguing for the\nreliability of one\u2019s perceptual\n faculties.[55]\n5.2 Introspection\n\nIntrospection is the capacity to inspect the present contents of\none\u2019s own mind. Through introspection, one knows what mental\nstates one is currently in: whether one is thirsty, tired, excited, or\ndepressed. Compared with perception, introspection appears to have a\nspecial status. It is easy to see how a perceptual seeming can go\nwrong: what looks like a cup of coffee on the table might be just be a\nclever hologram that\u2019s visually indistinguishable from an actual\ncup of coffee. But can it introspectively seem to me that I have a\nheadache when in fact I do not? It is not easy to see how it could be.\nThus introspection is widely thought to enjoy a special kind of\nimmunity to error. But what does this amount to?\n\nFirst, it could be argued that, when it comes to introspection, there\nis no difference between appearance and reality; therefore,\nintrospective seemings infallibly constitute their own success.\nAlternatively, one could view introspection as a source of certainty.\nHere the idea is that an introspective experience of p\neliminates any possible reason for doubt as to whether p is\ntrue. Finally, one could attempt to explain the specialness of\nintrospection by examining the way we respond to first-person reports:\ntypically, we attribute a special authority to such reports. According\nto this approach, introspection is incorrigible: its deliverances\ncannot be corrected by any other source.\n\nHowever we construe the special kind of immunity to error that\nintrospection enjoys, such immunity is not enjoyed by perception. Some\nfoundationalists have therefore thought that the foundations of our\nempirical knowledge can be furnished by introspection of our own\nperceptual experiences, rather than perception of mind-independent\nthings around us.\n\nIs it really true, however, that, compared with perception,\nintrospection is in some way special? Critics of foundationalism have\nargued that introspection is not infallible. Might one not confuse an\nunpleasant itch for a pain? Might I not think that the shape before me\nappears circular to me when in fact it appears slightly elliptical to\nme? If it is indeed possible for introspection to mislead, then it is\nnot clear in what sense introspection can constitute its own success,\nprovide certainty, or even incorrigibility. Yet it also isn\u2019t\neasy to see either how, if one clearly and distinctly feels a\nthrobbing headache, one could be mistaken about that. Introspection,\nthen, turns out to be a mysterious faculty. On the one hand, it does\nnot seem to be an infallible faculty; on the other hand, it is not\neasy to see how error is possible in many specific cases of\n introspection.[56]\n\nThe definition of introspection as the capacity to know the present\ncontents of one\u2019s own mind leaves open the question of how\nsimilar the different exercises of this capacity may be from one\nanother. According to some epistemologists, when we exercise this\ncapacity with respect to our sensations, we are doing something very\ndifferent from what we do when we exercise this capacity with respect\nto our own conscious beliefs, intentions, or other rationally\nevaluable states of mind: our exercises of this capacity with respect\nto our own conscious, rationally evaluable states of mind is, they\nclaim, partly constitutive of our being in those very states.\nIn support of this claim, they point out that we sometimes address\nquestions of the form \u201cdo you believe that p?\u201d by\nconsidering whether it is true that p, and reporting our belief\nconcerning p not by inspecting our mind, but rather by making up our\nmind (see Moran 2001 and Boyle 2009 for defenses of this view; see\nGertler 2011 for objections to the view).\n5.3 Memory\n\nMemory is the capacity to retain knowledge acquired in the past. What\none remembers, though, need not be a past event. It may be a present\nfact, such as one\u2019s telephone number, or a future event, such as\nthe date of the next elections. Memory is, of course, fallible. Not\nevery experience as of remembering that p is an instance of\ncorrectly remembering that p. We should distinguish, therefore,\nbetween remembering that p (which entails the truth of\np) and seeming to remember that p (which does\nnot entail the truth of p).\n\nWhat makes memorial seemings a source of justification? Is it a\nnecessary truth that, if one has a memorial seeming that p, one\nhas thereby prima facie justification for p? Or is memory a\nsource of justification only if, as coherentists might say, one has\nreason to think that one\u2019s memory is reliable? Or is memory a\nsource of justification only if, as externalists would say, it is in\nfact reliable? Also, how can we respond to skepticism about knowledge\nof the past? Memorial seemings of the past do not guarantee that the\npast is what we take it to be. We think that we are older than five\nminutes, but it is logically possible that the world sprang into\nexistence just five minutes ago, complete with our dispositions to\nhave memorial seemings of a more distant past and items such as\napparent fossils that suggest a past going back millions of years. Our\nseeming to remember that the world is older than a mere five minutes\ndoes not entail, therefore, that it really is. Why, then, should we\nthink that memory is a source of knowledge about the\n past?[57]\n5.4 Reason\n\nSome beliefs are (thought to be) justified independently of\nexperience. Justification of that kind is said to be a\npriori. A standard way of defining a priori\njustification is as follows:\n\n\nA Priori Justification\n\nS is justified a priori in believing that p if\nand only if S\u2019s justification for believing that p\ndoes not depend on any experience.\n\n\nWhen they are knowledgeably held, beliefs justified in this way are\ninstances of a priori\n knowledge.[58]\n\nWhat exactly counts as experience? If by \u201cexperience\u201d we\nmean just perceptual experiences, justification deriving from\nintrospective or memorial experiences would count as a\npriori. For example, I could then know a priori that\nI\u2019m thirsty, or what I ate for breakfast this morning. While the\nterm \u201ca priori\u201d is sometimes used in this way,\nthe strict use of the term restricts a priori justification\nto justification derived solely from the use of reason.\nAccording to this usage, the word \u201cexperiences\u201d in the\ndefinition above includes perceptual, introspective, and memorial\nexperiences alike. On this narrower understanding, paragons of what I\ncan know a priori are conceptual truths (such as \u201cAll\nbachelors are unmarried\u201d), and truths of mathematics, geometry\nand logic.\n\nJustification and knowledge that is not a priori is called\n\u201ca posteriori\u201d or \u201cempirical\u201d. For\nexample, in the narrow sense of \u201ca priori\u201d,\nwhether I\u2019m thirsty or not is something I know empirically (on\nthe basis of introspective experiences), whereas I know a\npriori that 12 divided by 3 is 4.\n\nSeveral important issues arise about a priori knowledge.\nFirst, does it exist at all? Skeptics about apriority deny its\nexistence. They don\u2019t mean to say that we have no knowledge of\nmathematics, geometry, logic, and conceptual truths. Rather, what they\nclaim is that all such knowledge is\n empirical.[59]\n\nSecond, if a priori justification is possible, exactly what\ndoes it involve? What makes a belief such as \u201cAll\nbachelors are unmarried\u201d justified? Is it an unmediated grasp of\nthe truth of this proposition? Or does it consist of grasping that the\nproposition is necessarily true? Or is it the purely\nintellectual state of \u201cseeing\u201d (with the \u201ceye of\nreason\u201d) or \u201cintuiting\u201d that this proposition is\ntrue (or necessarily true)? (see Bengson 2015 and Chudnoff 2013 for\nsophisticated defenses of this view). Or is it, as externalists would\nsuggest, the reliability of the cognitive process by which we come to\nrecognize the truth of such a proposition?\n\nThird, if a priori knowledge exists, what is its extent?\nEmpiricists have argued that a priori knowledge is\nlimited to the realm of the analytic, consisting of\npropositions true solely by virtue of our concepts, and so do not\nconvey any information about the world. Propositions that convey\ngenuine information about world are called synthetic. a\npriori knowledge of synthetic propositions, empiricists would\nsay, is not possible. Rationalists deny this. They might\nappeal to a proposition such as \u201cIf a ball is green all over,\nthen it doesn\u2019t have black spots\u201d as an example of a\nproposition that is both synthetic and yet knowable a priori\n(see Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009 and Malmgren 2011 for a discussion of\nthe content of such a priori justified judgments; for\nliterature on a priori knowledge, see BonJour 1998, BonJour\nin BonJour & Devitt 2005 [2013]; Boghossian and Peacocke 2000;\nCasullo 2003; Jenkins 2008, 2014; and Devitt 2014).\n5.5 Testimony\n\nTestimony differs from the sources we considered above because it\nisn\u2019t distinguished by having its own cognitive faculty. Rather,\nto acquire knowledge of p through testimony is to come to know\nthat p on the basis of someone\u2019s saying that p.\n\u201cSaying that p\u201d must be understood broadly, as\nincluding ordinary utterances in daily life, postings by bloggers on\ntheir blogs, articles by journalists, delivery of information on\ntelevision, radio, tapes, books, and other media. So, when you ask the\nperson next to you what time it is, and she tells you, and you thereby\ncome to know what time it is, that\u2019s an example of coming to\nknow something on the basis of testimony. And when you learn by\nreading the Washington Post that the terrorist attack in\nSharm el-Sheikh of 22 July 2005 killed at least 88 people, that, too,\nis an example of acquiring knowledge on the basis of testimony.\n\nThe epistemological puzzle testimony raises is this: Why is testimony\na source of knowledge? An externalist might say that testimony is a\nsource of knowledge if, and because, it comes from a reliable source.\nBut here, even more so than in the case of our faculties, internalists\nwill not find that answer satisfactory. Suppose you hear someone\nsaying \u201cp\u201d. Suppose further that person is in fact\nutterly reliable with regard to the question of whether p is\nthe case or not. Finally, suppose you have no clue whatever as to that\nperson\u2019s reliability. Wouldn\u2019t it be plausible to conclude\nthat, since that person\u2019s reliability is unknown to you, that\nperson\u2019s saying \u201cp\u201d does not put you in a\nposition to know that p? But if the reliability of a\ntestimonial source is not sufficient for making it a source of\nknowledge, what else is needed? Thomas Reid suggested that, by our\nvery nature, we accept testimonial sources as reliable and tend to\nattribute credibility to them unless we encounter special contrary\nreasons. But that\u2019s merely a statement of the attitude we in\nfact take toward testimony. What is it that makes that attitude\nreasonable? It could be argued that, in one\u2019s own personal\nexperiences with testimonial sources, one has accumulated a long track\nrecord that can be taken as a sign of reliability. However, when we\nthink of the sheer breadth of the knowledge we derive from testimony,\none wonders whether one\u2019s personal experiences constitute an\nevidence base rich enough to justify the attribution of reliability to\nthe totality of the testimonial sources one tends to trust (see E.\nFricker 1994 and M. Fricker 2007 for more on this issue). An\nalternative to the track record approach would be to declare it a\nnecessary truth that trust in testimonial sources is at least prima\nfacie justified. While this view has been prominently defended, it\nrequires an explanation of what makes such trust necessarily prima\nfacie justified. Such explanations have proven to be\n controversial.[60]\n\n6. The Limits of Cognitive Success\n6.1 General Skepticism and Selective Skepticism\n\nMuch of modern epistemology aims to address one or another kind of\nskepticism. Skepticism is a challenge to our pre-philosophical\nconception of ourselves as cognitively successful beings. Such\nchallenges come in many varieties. One way in which these varieties\ndiffer concerns the different kinds of cognitive success that they\ntarget: skepticism can challenge our claims to know, or our\nclaims to believe justifiably, or our claims to have\njustification for believing, or our claims to have any\ngood reasons for belief whatsoever. But another way in which\nthese varieties differ is in whether the skepticism in question is\nfully general\u2014targeting the possibility of enjoying any instance\nof the relevant cognitive success\u2014or is\nselective\u2014targeting the possibility of enjoying the relevant\ncognitive success concerning a particular subject matter (e.g., the\npast, the minds of others, the world beyond our own consciousness) or\nconcerning beliefs formed by a particular method (e.g., perception,\nmemory, reasoning, etc.). General skepticism and selective skepticism\npose very different sorts of challenges, and use very different kinds\nof arguments. General skepticism is motivated by reasoning from some\napparently conflicting features of the kind of cognitive success in\nquestion. For instance, a general skeptic might claim that\njustification requires a regress of justifiers, but then argue that\nthis regress of justifiers cannot be contained in any finite\nmind\u2014and thus, the skeptic might conclude, no finite being can\nbe justified in believing anything. Alternatively a general skeptic\nmight claim that knowledge requires certainty, and that nobody can be\ncertain of something unless there is nothing of which she could be\neven more certain\u2014thus, the skeptic might conclude, we can know\nvirtually nothing (see Unger 1975).\n\nSelective skepticism, in contrast, is typically motivated by appeal to\none or another skeptical hypothesis. A skeptical hypothesis is a\nhypothesis according to which the facts that you claim to know\n(whether these facts concern the past, or the mind of others, or the\nmind-independent world, or what have you) may, for all you can tell,\nbe radically different from how they appear to you to be. Thus, a\nskeptical hypothesis is a hypothesis that distinguishes between the\nway things appear to you, on the one hand, and the way they really\nare, on the other; and this distinction is deployed in such a way as\nto pose a challenge to your cognitive success concerning the latter.\nHere are some famous examples of skeptical hypotheses:\n\nAll the other humans around me are automata who simply act exactly\nas if they have thoughts and feelings.\nThe whole universe was created no more than 5 minutes ago, replete\nwith fake memories and other misleading evidence concerning a distant\npast.\nI\u2019m lying in my bed dreaming everything that I\u2019m aware\nof right now.\nI\u2019m a mere brain-in-a-vat (a BIV, for short) being\nelectrochemically stimulated to have all these states of mind that\nI\u2019m now having.\n\n\nSkeptics can make use of such hypotheses in constructing various\narguments that challenge our pre-philosophical picture of ourselves as\ncognitively successful. Consider, for instance, the BIV hypothesis,\nand some ways in which this hypothesis can be employed in a skeptical\nargument.\n\nHere is one way of doing so. According to the BIV hypothesis, the\nexperiences you would have as a BIV and the experiences you have as a\nnormal person are perfectly alike, indistinguishable, so to speak,\n\u201cfrom the inside\u201d. Thus, although it appears to you as if\nyou are a normally embodied human being, everything would appear\nexactly the same way to a BIV. Thus, the way things appear to you\ncannot provide you with knowledge that you are not a BIV. But if the\nway things appear to you cannot provide you with such knowledge, then\nnothing can give you such knowledge, and so you cannot know that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV. Of course, you already know this much: if you\nare a BIV, then you don\u2019t have any hands. If you don\u2019t\nknow that you\u2019re not a BIV, then you don\u2019t know that\nyou\u2019re not in a situation in which you don\u2019t have any\nhands. But if you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not in a\nsituation in which you don\u2019t have any hands, then you\ndon\u2019t know that you\u2019re not handless. And to not know that\nyou\u2019re not handless is simply to not know that you have hands.\nWe can summarize this skeptical argument as follows:\n\n\nThe BIV-Knowledge Closure Argument (BKCA)\n\n(C1) I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not a\nBIV.\n(C2) If I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not\na BIV, then I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(C3) I don\u2019t know that I have\nhands.\n\n\n\nAs we have just seen, (C1) and (C2) are very plausible\npremises. It would seem, therefore, that BKCA is sound. If it is, we\nmust conclude we don\u2019t know we have hands. But surely that\nconclusion can\u2019t be right: if it turns out that I don\u2019t\nknow that I have hands, that must be because of something very\npeculiar about my cognitive relation to the issue of whether I have\nhands\u2014not because of the completely anodyne\nconsiderations mentioned in BKCA. So we are confronted with a\ndifficult challenge: The conclusion of the BKCA seems plainly false,\nbut on what grounds can we reject\n it?[61]\n\nHere are some other ways of using the BIV hypothesis to generate a\nskeptical argument.\n\n\nThe BIV-Justification Underdetermination Argument\n(BJUA)\n\n(U1) The way things appear to me could be\nequally well explained by the BIV hypothesis as by my ordinary beliefs\nthat things appear to me the way they do because I perceive\nmind-independent objects.\n(U2) If the way things appear to me could be\nequally well explained by either of two hypotheses, then I am not\njustified in believing one of those hypotheses rather than the\nother.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(U3) I am not justified in believing that I\nperceive mind-independent objects.\n\n\n\n\nThe BIV-Knowledge Defeasibility Argument (BKDA)\n\n(D1) If I know that I have hands, then I know that\nany evidence indicating that I don\u2019t have hands is misleading\nevidence.\n(D2) If I know that some evidence is misleading, then\nI know that I should disregard that evidence.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(D3) If I know that I have hands, then I know that I\nshould disregard any evidence to the contrary.\n(D4) I do not know that I should disregard any\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(D5) I do not know that I have hands.\n\n\n\n\nThe BIV-Epistemic Possibility Argument (BEPA)\n\n(P1) It\u2019s at least possible that\nI\u2019m a BIV.\n(P2) If it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m a BIV, then\nit\u2019s possible that I don\u2019t have hands.\n(P3) If it\u2019s possible that I don\u2019t have\nhands, then I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(P4) I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\n\nObviously, this list of skeptical arguments could be extended by\nvarying either (a) the skeptical hypothesis employed, or (b) the kind\nof cognitive success being challenged, or (c) the epistemological\nprinciples that link the hypothesis in (a) and the challenge in (b).\nSome of the resulting skeptical arguments are more plausible than\nothers, and some are historically more prominent than others, but\nthere isn\u2019t space for a comprehensive survey. Here, we will\nreview some of the more influential replies to BKCA, BJUA, BKDA, and\nBEPA.\n6.2 Responses to the Closure Argument\n\nNext, we will examine various responses to the\n BKCA\n argument. According to the first, we can see that\n (C2)\n is false if we distinguish between relevant and irrelevant\nalternatives. An alternative to a proposition p is any\nproposition that is incompatible with p. Your having hands and\nyour being a BIV are alternatives: if the former is true, the latter\nis false, and vice versa. According to the thought that\nmotivates the second premise of the BIV argument, you know that you\nhave hands only if you can discriminate between your actually having\nhands and the alternative of being a (handless) BIV. But, by\nhypothesis, you can\u2019t discriminate between these. That\u2019s\nwhy you don\u2019t know that you have hands. In response to such\nreasoning, a relevant alternatives theorist would say that your\ninability to discriminate between these two is not an obstacle to your\nknowing that you have hands, and that\u2019s because your being a BIV\nis not a relevant alternative to your having hands.\nWhat would be a relevant alternative? This, for example: your arms\nending in stumps rather than hands, or your having hooks instead of\nhands, or your having prosthetic hands. But these alternatives\ndon\u2019t prevent you from knowing that you have hands\u2014not\nbecause they are irrelevant, but rather because you can discriminate\nbetween these alternatives and your having hands. The relevant\nalternative theorist holds, therefore, that you do know that you have\nhands: you know it because you can discriminate it from relevant\nalternatives, like your having stumps rather than hands.\n\nThus, according to Relevant Alternatives theorists, you know that you\nhave hands even though you don\u2019t know that you are not a BIV.\nThere are two chief problems for this approach. The first is that\ndenouncing the BIV alternative as irrelevant is ad hoc unless\nit is supplemented with a principled account of what makes one\nalternative relevant and another irrelevant. The second is that\npremise 2 is highly plausible. To deny it is to allow that the\nfollowing conjunction can be true:\n\n\nAbominable Conjunction\n\nI know that I have hands but I do not know that I am not a (handless)\nBIV.\n\n\nMany epistemologists would agree that this conjunction is indeed\nabominable because it blatantly violates the basic and extremely\nplausible intuition that you can\u2019t know you have hands without\nknowing that you are not a\n BIV.[62]\n\nNext, let us consider a response to BKCA according to which it\u2019s\nnot the second but the first premise that must be rejected. G. E.\nMoore has pointed out that an argument succeeds only to the extent\nthat its premises are more plausible than the conclusion. So if we\nencounter an argument whose conclusion we find much more implausible\nthan the denial of the premises, then we can turn the argument on its\nhead. According to this approach, we can respond to the BIV argument\nas follows:\n\n\nCounter BIV\n\n(~C3) I know that I have hands.\n(C2) If I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not a BIV, then I\ndon\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(~C1) I know that I am not a BIV.\n\n\n\nUnless we are skeptics or opponents of closure, we would have to\nconcede that this argument is sound. It is valid, and its premises are\ntrue. Yet few philosophers would agree that Counter BIV amounts to a\nsatisfying response to the BIV argument. It fails to explain\nhow one can know that one is not a BIV. The observation that\nthe premises of the BIV argument are less plausible than the denial of\nits conclusion doesn\u2019t help us understand how such knowledge is\npossible. That\u2019s why the Moorean response, unsupplemented with\nan account of how one can know that one is not a BIV, is widely\nthought to be an unsuccessful rebuttal of\n BKCA.[63]\n\nWe have looked at two responses to BKCA. The relevant alternatives\nresponse implausibly denies the second premise. The Moorean response\ndenies the first premise without explaining how we could possibly have\nthe knowledge that the first premise claims we don\u2019t have.\nAnother prominent response, contextualism, avoids both of these\nobjections. According to the contextualist, the precise contribution\nthat the verb \u201cto know\u201d makes to the truth-conditions of\nthe sentences in which it occurs varies from one context to another:\nin contexts in which the BIV hypothesis is under discussion, an agent\ncounts as \u201cknowing\u201d a fact only if she can satisfy some\nextremely high (typically unachievable) epistemic feat, and this is\nwhy (1) is true. But in contexts in which the BIV hypothesis is not\nunder discussion, an agent can count as \u201cknowing\u201d a fact\neven if her epistemic position vis-\u00e0-vis that fact is much more\nmodest, and this is why (3), taken in isolation, appears false.\n\nThe contextualist literature has grown vastly over the past two\ndecades: different contextualists have different accounts of how\nfeatures of context affect the meaning of some occurrence of the verb\n\u201cto know\u201d, and each proposal has encountered specific\nchallenges concerning the semantic mechanisms that it posits, and the\nextent to which it explains the whole range of facts about which\nepistemic claims are plausible under which\n conditions.[64]\n6.3 Responses to the Underdetermination Argument\n\nBoth the contextualist and the Moorean responses to\n BKCA,\n as discussed in the previous section, leave out one important detail.\nBoth say that one can know that one isn\u2019t a BIV (though\ncontextualists grant this point only for the sense of\n\u201cknow\u201d operational in low-standards contexts), but neither\nview explains how one can know such a thing. If, by\nhypothesis, a BIV has all the same states of mind that I\nhave\u2014including all the same perceptual experiences\u2014then\nhow can I be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV? And if I\ncan\u2019t be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV, then\nhow can I know that I\u2019m not?\n\nOf course, the question about how I can be justified in believing that\nI\u2019m not a BIV is not especially hard for externalists to answer.\nFrom the point of view of an externalist, the fact that you and the\nBIV have the very same states of mind need not be at all relevant to\nthe issue of whether you\u2019re justified in believing that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV, since such justification isn\u2019t fully\ndetermined by those mental states anyway.\n\nThe philosophers who have had to do considerable work to answer the\nquestion how I can be justified in believing that I\u2019m not a BIV\nhave typically done this work not directly in reply to BKCA, but\nrather in reply to BJUA.\n\nWhat might justify your belief that you\u2019re not a BIV? According\nto some philosophers, you are justified in believing that you\u2019re\nnot a BIV because, for instance, you know perfectly well that current\ntechnology doesn\u2019t enable anyone to create a BIV. The proponent\nof the BIV hypothesis might regard this answer as no better than the\nMoorean response to BKCA: if you are allowed to appeal to (what you\nregard as your) knowledge of current technology to justify your belief\nthat you\u2019re not a BIV, then why can\u2019t the Moorean equally\nwell rely on his knowledge that he has hands to justify his belief\nthat he\u2019s not a BIV? Philosophers who accept this objection, but\nwho don\u2019t want to ground your justification for believing that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV in purely externalistic factors, may instead\nclaim that your belief is justified by the fact that your own beliefs\nabout the external world provide a better explanation of your sense\nexperiences than does the BIV hypothesis (see Russell 1912 and Vogel\n1990 for influential defenses of this argument against skepticism, and\nsee Neta 2004 for a rebuttal).\n6.4 Responses to the Defeasibility Argument\n\nThe most influential reply to\n BKDA\n is to say that, when I acquire evidence that I don\u2019t have\nhands, such evidence makes me cease to know that I have hands. On this\nview, when I acquire such evidence, the argument above is sound. But\nprior to my acquiring such evidence, (4) is false, and so the argument\nabove is not sound. Thus, the truth of (4), and consequently the\nsoundness of this argument, depends on whether or not I have evidence\nthat I don\u2019t have hands. If I do have such evidence, then the\nargument is sound, but of course it has no general skeptical\nimplications: all it shows that I can\u2019t know some fact whenever\nI have evidence that the fact doesn\u2019t obtain (versions of this\nview are defended by Harman 1973 and Ginet 1980).\n\nPlausible as this reply has seemed to most philosophers, it has been\neffectively challenged by Lasonen-Aarnio (2014b). Her argument is\nthis: presumably, it\u2019s possible to have more than\nenough evidence to know some fact. But if it\u2019s possible to\nhave more than enough evidence to know some fact, it follows that one\nmight still know that fact even if one acquires some slight evidence\nagainst it. And yet, it would be wrong to leave one\u2019s confidence\nentirely unaffected by the slight evidence that one acquires against\nthat fact: though the evidence might be too slight to destroy\none\u2019s knowledge, it cannot be too slight to diminish one\u2019s\nconfidence even slightly. So long as one could continue to know a fact\nwhile rationally diminishing one\u2019s confidence in it in response\nto new evidence, the most popular reply to the defeasibility argument\nfails.\n\nOther replies to the defeasibility argument include the denial of\npremise\n (2),[65]\n the denial of (4) (McDowell 1982, Kern 2006 [2017]), and the claim\nthat the context-sensitivity of \u201cknows\u201d means that (4) is\ntrue only relative to contexts in which the possibility of future\ndefeaters is relevant (see Neta 2002). But neither of these replies\nhas yet received widespread assent.\n6.5 Responses to the Epistemic Possibility Argument\n\nThe most common reply to\n BEPA\n is either to deny premise (1), or to deny that we are justified in\nbelieving that premise (1) is true. Most writers would deny premise\n(1), and would do so on whatever grounds they have for thinking that I\ncan know that I\u2019m not a BIV: knowing that something is not the\ncase excludes that thing\u2019s being epistemically possible for\n you.[66]\n\nBut a couple of influential writers\u2014most notably Rogers\nAlbritton and Thompson Clarke (see Albritton 2011 and Clarke\n1972)\u2014do not claim that premise (1) is false. Rather, they deny\nthat we are justified in believing that premise (1) is true. According\nto these writers, what normally justifies us in believing that\nsomething or other is epistemically possible is that we can conceive\nof discovering that it is true. For instance, what justifies\nme in believing, say, that it\u2019s possible that Donald Trump has\nresigned is that I can clearly conceive of discovering that\nDonald Trump has resigned. But if I attempt to conceive of discovering\nthat I\u2019m a BIV, it\u2019s not clear that I can succeed in this\nattempt. I may conceive of coming upon some evidence that I\u2019m a\nBIV\u2014but, insofar as this evidence tells in favor of the\nhypothesis that I\u2019m a BIV, doesn\u2019t it also undermine its\nown credibility? In such a case, is there anything at all that would\ncount as \u201cmy evidence\u201d? (see Neta forthcoming for an\nelaboration of this point). Without being able to answer this question\nin the affirmative, it\u2019s not clear that I can conceive of\nanything that would amount to discovering that I\u2019m a BIV. Of\ncourse, from the fact that I cannot conceive of anything that would\namount to discovering that I\u2019m a BIV, it doesn\u2019t follow\nthat I\u2019m not a BIV\u2014and so it doesn\u2019t even follow\nthat it\u2019s not possible that I\u2019m a BIV. But, whether or not\nit is possible that I\u2019m a BIV, I can\u2019t be\njustified in thinking that it is. And that\u2019s to say that I\ncan\u2019t be justified in accepting premise (1) of BEPA.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, Jonathan Eric, 2002, <em>Belief\u2019s Own Ethics</em>,\nCambridge, MA: MIT Press.", "Albritton, Rogers, 2011, \u201cOn a Form of Skeptical Argument\nfrom Possibility\u201d, <em>Philosophical Issues</em>, 21:\n1\u201324. doi:10.1111/j.1533-6077.2011.00195.x", "Alston, William P., 1971 [1989], \u201cVarieties of Privileged\nAccess\u201d, <em>American Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 8(3):\n223\u2013241.
