    "main_text": "Identity Philosophy\n3. Identity Philosophy\n\nAlthough the period of Schelling\u2019s \u2018identity\nphilosophy\u2019 is usually dated from the 1801 Presentation of\nMy System of Philosophy until sometime before the 1809 On the\nEssence of Human Freedom, the project of that philosophy can be\nsaid to be carried on in differing ways throughout his work. The\nidentity philosophy derives from Schelling\u2019s conviction that the\nself-conscious I must be seen as a result, rather than as the\noriginating act it is in Fichte, and thus that the I cannot be seen as\nthe generative matrix of the whole system. This takes him more in the\ndirection of Spinoza, but the problem is still that of articulating\nthe relationship between the I and the world of nature, without either\nreverting to Kantian dualism or failing to explain how a purely\nobjective nature could give rise to subjectivity.\n\nSchelling\u2019s mature identity philosophy, which is contained in\nthe System of the Whole of Philosophy and of Naturphilosophie in\nParticular, written in W\u00fcrzburg in 1804, and in other texts\nbetween 1804 and 1807, breaks with the model of truth as\ncorrespondence. It does so because:\n\nIt is clear that in every explanation of the truth as a correspondence\n(\u00dcbereinstimmung) of subjectivity and objectivity in\nknowledge, both, subject and object, are already presupposed as\nseparate, for only what is different can agree, what is not different\nis in itself one. (SW I/6, p. 138)\n\n\nThe crucial problem is how to explain the link between the\nsubject and object world that makes judgements possible, and this\ncannot be achieved in terms of how a subject can have thoughts which\ncorrespond to an object essentially separate from it. For there to be\njudgements at all what is split and then synthesised in the judgement\nmust, Schelling contends, in some way already be the same. This has\noften been understood as leading Schelling to a philosophy in which,\nas Hegel puts it in the Phenomenology, the absolute is the\n\u2018night in which all cows are black\u2019, because it swallows\nall differentiated knowledge in the assertion that everything is\nultimately the same, namely an absolute which excludes all relativity\nfrom itself and thus becomes inarticulable. This is not a valid\ninterpretation of Schelling\u2019s argument. In an early version of\nthe identity philosophy he had said the following:\n\nFor most people see in the essence of the Absolute nothing but pure\nnight and cannot recognise anything in it; it shrinks before them into\na mere negation of difference, and is for them something purely\nprivative, whence they cleverly make it into the end of their\nphilosophy (\u2026) I want to show here (\u2026) how that night of\nthe Absolute can be turned into day for knowledge (SW I/4, p. 403).\n\n\nIn order to try to get over the problem in monism of how the One is\nalso the many, Schelling, following the idea outlined above from\nH\u00f6lderlin, introduces a notion of \u2018transitive\u2019 being,\nwhich links mind and matter as predicates of itself. Schelling\nexplains this \u2018transitivity\u2019 via the metaphor of the\nearth:\n\nyou recognise its [the earth\u2019s] true essence only in the link by\nwhich it eternally posits its unity as the multiplicity of its things\nand again posits this multiplicity as its unity. You also do not\nimagine that, apart from this infinity of things which are in it,\nthere is another earth which is the unity of these things, rather\nthe same which is the multiplicity is also unity, and\nwhat the unity is, is also the multiplicity, and this\nnecessary and indissoluble One of unity and multiplicity in it is what\nyou call its existence (\u2026) Existence is the link of a being\n(Wesen) as One, with itself as a multiplicity. (SW I/7, p.\n56)\n\n\n\u2018Absolute identity\u2019 is, then, the link of the two\naspects of being, which, on the one hand, is the universe,\nand, on the other, is the changing multiplicity which the\nknowable universe also is. Schelling insists now that \u201cThe\nI think, I am, is, since Descartes, the basic\nmistake of all knowledge; thinking is not my thinking, and being is\nnot my being, for everything is only of God or the totality\u201d (SW\nI/7, p. 148), so the I is \u2018affirmed\u2019 as a predicate of the\nbeing by which it is preceded. In consequence he already begins to\nmove away, albeit inconsistently, from the German Idealist model in\nwhich the intelligibility of being is regarded as a result of its\nhaving an essentially mind-like structure.\n\nSchelling is led to this view by his understanding of the changing and\nrelative status of theoretical knowledge. It is the inherent\nincompleteness of all finite determinations which reveals the nature\nof the absolute. His description of time makes clear what he means:\n\u201ctime is itself nothing but the totality appearing in\nopposition to the particular life of things\u201d, so that the\ntotality \u201cposits or intuits itself, by not positing, not\nintuiting the particular\u201d (SW I/6, p. 220). The particular is\ndetermined in judgements, but the truth of claims about the totality\ncannot be proven because judgements are necessarily conditioned,\nwhereas the totality is not. Given the relative status of the\nparticular there must, though, be a ground which enables us to be\naware of that relativity, and this ground must have a\ndifferent status from the knowable world of finite particulars. At the\nsame time, if the ground were wholly different from the world of\nrelative particulars the problems of dualism would recur. As such the\nabsolute is the finite, but we do not know this in\nthe manner we know the finite. Without the presupposition of\n\u2018absolute identity\u2019, therefore, the evident relativity of\nparticular knowledge becomes inexplicable, since there would be no\nreason to claim that a revised judgement is predicated of the same\nworld as the preceding \u2014 now false \u2014 judgement.\n\nSchelling summarises his theory of identity as follows:\n\nfor being, actual, real being is precisely self-disclosure/revelation\n(Selbstoffenbarung). If it is to be as One then it must\ndisclose/reveal itself in itself; but it does not disclose/reveal\nitself in itself if it is not an other in itself, and is in\nthis other the One for itself, thus if it is not absolutely the living\nlink of itself and an other. (SW I/7, p. 54)\n\n\nThe link between the \u2018real\u2019 and the \u2018ideal\u2019\ncannot be regarded as a causal link. Although there cannot be mental\nevents without physical events, the former cannot be reduced to being\nthe causal results of the latter: \u201cFor real and ideal are only\ndifferent views of one and the same substance\u201d (SW I/6, p. 501).\nSchelling wavers at this time between a \u2018reflexive\u2019\nposition of the kind which Hegel will soon try to articulate, in\nwhich, in Schelling\u2019s terms, \u201cthe sameness of the\nsubjective and the objective is made the same as itself, knows itself,\nand is the subject and object of itself\u201d (SW I/6, p. 173), in\nthe \u2018identity of identity and difference\u2019, and the sense\nthat this position cannot finally circumscribe the structure of the\nabsolute. The structure of reflection, where each aspect reflects\nitself and then is reflected in the other, upon which this account of\nthe identity of subject and object relies, must be grounded in a being\nwhich carries it:\n\nreflection (\u2026) only knows the universal and the particular as\ntwo relative negations, the universal as relative negation of the\nparticular, which is, as such, without reality, the particular, on the\nother hand, as a relative negation of the universal. (\u2026)\nsomething independent of the concept must be added to posit the\nsubstance as such. (SW I/6, p. 185)\n\n\nWithout this independent basis subject and object would merely be, as\nSchelling thinks they are in Fichte, relative negations of each other,\nleading to a circle \u201cinside which a nothing gains reality by the\nrelation to another nothing\u201d (SW I/4, p. 358). Schelling\nprophetically distinguishes between the cognitive \u2014 reflexive\n\u2014 ground of finite knowledge and the real \u2014 non-reflexive\n\u2014 ground that sustains the movement of negation from one finite\ndetermination to another. As a two-sided relationship reflection alone\nalways entails the problem that the subject and the object in a case\nof reflection can only be known to be the same via that which\ncannot appear in the reflection. If I am to recognise myself\nas myself in a mirror, rather than see a random object in the\nworld, I must already be familiar with myself before\nthe reflection, in a way which is not part of the reflection. This\nmeans a complete system based on reflection is impossible, because, in\norder for the system to be grounded, it must presuppose as external to\nitself what it claims is part of itself. Schelling will, in his\nphilosophy from the 1820s onwards, raise versions of this objection\nagainst Hegel\u2019s system.\n\nSchelling\u2019s own dissatisfaction with his early versions of\nidentity theory derives from his rejection of Spinozism. Spinoza\nregards the move from God to the world of \u2018conditions\u2019 as\na logical consequence of the nature of God. Schelling becomes\nconvinced that such a theory gives no reason why the absolute, the\n\u2018unconditioned\u2019, should manifest itself in a world of\nnegative \u2018conditions\u2019 at all. Schelling is therefore\nconfronted with explaining why there is a transition from the absolute\nto the finite world, a finite world which he comes to see increasingly\nin terms of the suffering and tragedy it has to involve. In\nPhilosophy and Religion, of 1804, he claims, like Jacobi,\nthat there is no way of mediating between conditioned and\nunconditioned, and already makes the distinction between\n\u2018negative\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 philosophy, which\nwill form the heart of his late work. Explicating the structure of the\nfinite world leads to \u201cnegative philosophy, but much has already\nbeen gained by the fact that the negative, the realm of nothingness,\nhas been separated by a sharp limit from the realm of reality and of\nwhat alone is positive\u201d (SW I/6, p. 43). The question which\ncomes to concern Schelling is how philosophy can come to terms with a\nground which cannot be regarded as the rational explanation of the\nfinite world, because the finite world involves so much that makes no\nrational sense.\n",
