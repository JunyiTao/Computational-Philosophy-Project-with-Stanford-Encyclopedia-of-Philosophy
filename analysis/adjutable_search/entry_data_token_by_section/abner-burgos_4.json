    "main_text": "Critics of the Aristotelian science\n5. Critics of the Aristotelian science\n\nAs we stated before, the major work of science of Abner (the New\nPhilosophy) is lost. We can still try to reconstruct some of his\nscientific opinions through some parts of his other works,\nspecifically the existing work Meyasher Aqob, Rabbi Isaac\nPulgar\u2019s brief summary of the lost work, and some scientific passages\nin Mostrador de\n Justicia.[21]\n\nThe first interesting opinion of Abner is his view on prime matter.\nAbner denied a necessary link, which the Aristotelians affirmed,\nbetween bodies and accidents (magnitude, weight, quantity, etc.),\nmaintaining that a body untainted by all these accidents can\nnonetheless have actual existence. He explicated his view in the\ndogmatic context of the question of the rite of\n Mass.[22]\n The rebel\u2019s main philosophical arguments against the Mass are as\nfollows: (1) How can several bodies occupy the same place? (2) How can\nJesus\u2019 body be in the bread and wine without changing them? (3) How\ncan the same body be two different materials at the same time? (4) How\ncan one debase Jesus by eating and digesting him? At the start of his\nanswer Abner emphasizes that the Mass is miraculous. Nevertheless, he\ndoes go on to offer a scientific explanation of transubstantiation.\nFor Abner, everybody has a layer of pure divine existence, to which\nare superadded other forms and accidents; but if the body is stripped\nof all of these accretions it will be reduced to the original divine\nsubstance only. In this state the body will have no boundary,\nquantity, or weight to occupy the universe, and consequently is\ninfinite. This body is the foundation of the entire material world,\nand normally\u2014with the exception of the sacrament of the Mass and\nIncarnation\u2014it does not exist without accidents (at least not in\nthe sublunary world). This matter is identified with the flesh of\nJesus, which has divine existence only, which means that Jesus\u2019 body\nis identified with prime matter.\n\nThe above description eliminates for Abner all of the difficulties\nposed by the rebel. The problem of the co-presence of two bodies in\none place is eliminated, because all bodies, once they have been\nstripped of their form and accidents, incorporate the infinite body of\nJesus, which fills the entire universe. After these forms have been\nremoved, the bread and wine are identified with Jesus\u2019 body. The very\nsame principle eliminates the problem of the simultaneous existence of\nJesus\u2019 body in several places, since his body fills the entire\nuniverse and transcends all definitions of place. Because his body\nalso transcends the definition of quantity, the problem of limited\nquantity is removed as well.\n\nAnother subject about which Abner critiques Aristotelian science is\nthe definition of place and the relation between place and body. In\nthe thought of Aristotle, the definition of place is \u2018the limit\nof the encompassing body\u2019. In his opinion, place has an\nimportant role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is\nthe movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle\nexplains that both the natural place attracts the body and that the\nbody moves on his own to its natural place.\n\nAbner distinguishes between the physical object and extension or\ndimension. According to Abner, dimension is \u201ca simple and subtle\nquantity detached from all movable bodies\u201d; in other words, it\nis space, independent of any physical body. Dimension is measurable\nper se, and is not linked to what occupies it. Nevertheless, Abner\u2019s\ndefinition of place is still associated with body: \u201cplace\u201d\nis the dimension occupied by a body, and it is the body that turns it\ninto \u201cplace.\u201d According to Abner, the movement of bodies\nis not due to their being attracted to some place where they must rest\nbefore resuming their movement; rather, they move because of the\ninteraction of several forces, quite independent of any particular\nplace. A body that is thrown upward rises, but if it suddenly begins\nto fall because of an opposing force, there would not be a moment of\nrest between the two opposing motions.\n\nThus Abner dismisses Aristotle\u2019s concept that a body is attracted to\nits natural place. Different places are not characterized by different\nqualities (inasmuch as all places are equal and are merely points in\nspace). Hence a body has no cause to move to a particular place and no\nplace is a final cause of its motion.\n\nWe know from Rabbi Isaac Pulgar that Abner also criticized the\nopinions of Aristotle on the possibility of a void and argues for the\nexistence of voids in his lost scientific book The New\nPhilosophy. Because of the influence of Abner on Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, we can assume that his criticism is closely related to the\ncriticism of Crescas in the beginning of the first speech of Or\nHashem\n\nAbner wrote his criticism of Artistotelian science at the beginning of\nthe 14th century, approximately the same time that Ockham\nwrote his criticism of this science. In the writing and the thought of\nAbner we do not see any kind of influence of Ockham or of other late\nscholastics (the only scholastic philosopher that he cites is Thomas\nAquinas and there are no quotations from Christian sources on a\nscientific subject). It is interesting to note that the systematic\ncriticism of Aristotelian science started approximately at the same\ntime in the Jewish milieu (with the writings of Abner) and in the\nChristian milieu, with probably no relation one to the other.\n\nAbner\u2019s criticism of Aristotelian science had an important influence\non Crescas\u2019s thought, and through him to Pico Della Mirandola and\ngeneral Western philosophy.\n",
