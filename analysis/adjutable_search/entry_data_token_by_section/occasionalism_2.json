Given how many prominent\nCartesians were indeed occasionalists, it is not surprising that\nDescartes has been suggested as the source of this new wave of\noccasionalism that swept through the European continent in the second\nhalf of the seventeenth century. Some interpreters, accordingly, have\nheld that, while perhaps not fully endorsing occasionalism across the\nboard, Descartes did hold occasionalist views with regard to extended\nsubstances, or bodies. According to these interpreters, Descartes\ndenied that bodies acted on either other bodies or\n minds.[4]\n Others disagree and have argued, for instance, that in cases of\nbody-body interaction, Descartes affirmed the genuine causal powers of\nextended\n substances.[5]\n Note that, given the general framework of Cartesian dualism, four\ntypes of causal interaction among finite substances are usually\nconsidered: (1) body-body causation, where one extended substance\naffects another; (2) body-mind causation, where bodily changes bring\nabout changes in the mind; (3) mind-body causation, where the\ndirection of causation is reverse to that of body-mind causation, and\ncertain thoughts or volitions bring about changes in bodies; (4)\nintra-mental causation, where various forms of mental activity, such\nas producing ideas, are considered as typical cases. It is within this\nframework that the respective positions about causation, occasionalist\nor not, can be identified.\n\nCases (2) and (3) have received much attention from the general\nphilosophical audience. This phenomenon stems as far back as Princess\nElisabeth of Bohemia (see her astute exchange with Descartes in AT III\n663\u20138 (CSM III, 218)). As we can see in Elisabeth\u2019s\ncorrespondence, from the beginning much of the focus has been directed\nat the issue of how or even whether two radically different substances\ncan causally interact. And this attention has at times led to the\ncaricature of occasionalism as an ad hoc solution to this problem for\nCartesian dualists. But, as we have already seen and will further see,\nthe scope and depth of the issues surrounding the emergence of\noccasionalism make it clear that this depiction is indeed a caricature\nat\n best.[6]\n\nIn contrast to the situation concerning Descartes\u2019 alleged\ncommitment to occasionalism, there is no disagreement in the case of\nNicolas Malebranche, whose works provide some of the most extensive\nand important discussions of occasionalism. Thus, his arguments will\nbe the topic of further examination. But in addition to Malebranche,\nthere were a number of other Cartesians, prior to Malebranche, that\npresented a variety of views indicative of the occasionalist current\nin the 1660s. Among these Cartesians, the French physician and\nphilosopher Louis de la Forge (1632\u201366), the Parisian lawyer and\nphilosopher G\u00e9raud de Cordemoy (1614\u201383), the German\ntheologian and philosopher Johannes Clauberg (1622\u201355), and the\nDutch philosopher Arnold Geulincx (1624\u201369) are the most\nprominent.\n\nIn the case of La Forge, his credentials as an occasionalist about the\ncausal efficacy of extended substances or bodies has never been in\ndoubt. In fact, as noted earlier, it is La Forge who has been\nsuggested to have first employed the expression \u201coccasional\ncause\u201d in his Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019esprit de\nl\u2019homme (Carraud 2002, 347), where he argues that bodies\nare merely the \u201cremote and occasional\u201d causes of our ideas\nof them (TEH 132\u20134). Some interpreters have argued that\nLa Forge\u2019s occasionalism extended to minds as well and thus was\na global occasionalist (Prost 1907, ch.6; Bouillier 1865, vol. 1, 503,\n513; cf. Nadler 1993b, 60, especially footnote 11), but others have\nargued against this view (Bardout 2002a, 145; Nadler 1993b,\n60\u201361). The case for restricting the scope of La Forge\u2019s\noccasionalism to only extended substances seems well grounded, if we\ntake into consideration such texts as the following: \u201cAll of our\nideas considered in themselves in so far as they are only different\nways of thinking, need \u2026 no cause for their production other\nthan our mind\u201d (TEH 177; cf. Nadler 1993b, 65).\n\nLa Forge\u2019s work is also significant in that he seems to have\nbeen the first in this period to present an argument for occasionalism\non the basis of how God conserves an extended substance in existence.\nThis argument puts particular emphasis on the fact that God must not\nonly \u201ccontinue to produce [a body], if he wants to preserve it\nin existence; but, in addition, because he cannot create it everywhere\nnor outside of any particular place, he must himself put it in a\nplace\u201d (TEH 241; cf. Nadler 1993b, 63; Nadler 1998,\n219). As we shall see, this argument bears a strong resemblance to\nMalebranche\u2019s most persuasive argument for global occasionalism,\nthe \u201cconservation is but continuous creation\u201d\nargument.\n\nG\u00e9raud de Cordemoy\u2019s work appears to have had a direct\ninfluence on Malebranche, as Malebranche himself acknowledges in the\nSearch (OCM I 123/Search 49; Nadler 2005,\n38; cf. Gouhier 1926 95ff.; Battail 1973, 146ff.). Though there has\nbeen some disagreement about the scope of Cordemoy\u2019s\noccasionalism, the consensus seems to be that he was a global\noccasionalist, denying causal efficacy to both minds and bodies. Thus,\nin this respect, he is a precursor to Malebranche. Cordemoy is also\nknown for a rather distinctive argument for why bodies are not real\ncauses, one that employs the controversial premise that the motion of\na body can be continued only by the causal agent that initiated it\n(Discernement 135\u201336; cf. Nadler 2005, 42). Based on\nthe observation that bodies do not self-initiate movement, Cordemoy\nargues that bodies thus need to be set into motion by a non-material\nfirst mover (Nadler 2005, 42). But given the aforementioned premise,\nany subsequent movement of bodies can only be continued by the causal\nagent that initially moved them, which leads to the occasionalist\nconclusion that God is the cause of all bodily motion. This argument\nseems to be related to a slightly different argument employed by\nMalebranche to argue for the same conclusion\u2014that is, the lack\nof causal efficacy of extended substances. This latter argument, which\nemphasizes the passivity or passive nature of bodies, is one of\nMalebranche\u2019s favorites and will be examined in more detail\nlater.\n\nJohannes Clauberg (1622\u20131655) has been identified by some as one of\nthe first philosophers influenced by Descartes to argue for\noccasionalism with regard to mind-body interaction on the basis of\ntheir radical heterogeneity (Bardout 2008b). With regard to other\ndomains, such as body-body causation, the majority consensus appears\nto be that he rejected occasionalism, and allowed bodily substances to\nbe causally efficacious (Nadler 2011). Even with regard to his\noccasionalism concerning mind-body interaction, his position has been\nsuggested to be rather nuanced. Schmaltz, for instance, has argued\nthat Clauberg\u2019s occasionalism is restricted to the direction of\nbody to mind, such as in the case of sensations arising in accordance\nwith bodily changes, since there are textual grounds to think that\nClauberg endorsed some type of genuine causality on the part of our\nvolitions in the case of our voluntary control over our bodies\n(Schmaltz 2016, 180-1). Given our characterization of occasionalism at\nthe outset, however, even this restricted version might not qualify\nClauberg\u2019s position as occasionalist, since most scholars agree\nthat Clauberg thinks that it is the soul itself that causes the\nrelevant sensations on the occasion of certain bodily changes. That\nis, Clauberg does not think that it is God that is unique genuine\ncause behind the occurrence of our sensations, a view he would have to\nhold were he to satisfy the requirements of occasionalism as we have\nspecified it (Schmaltz and others well acknowledge this point).\nClauberg\u2019s significance then might best be thought of as\npresenting the explicit rejection of bodily changes being genuine\ncauses of changes in the mind (Bardout 2008b, Schmaltz 2016). The\ncomplexity of Clauberg\u2019s views can be seen as an example\nrevealing how intricate and finely nuanced the diverse position came\nto be in the face of the complex considerations that were operative in\nthis period. \n\nArnold Geulincx\u2019s most distinctive contribution to the\ndevelopment of occasionalism comes in the form of a causal principle\nthat puts an epistemic restriction on the exercise of genuine\ncausality (see Nadler 1999, 268). In his Metaphysica vera,\nGeulincx states that \u201cit is impossible to bring about something\nwhen one does not know how it is brought about \u2026 you are not the\ncause of that which you do not know how to bring about\n(impossibile est, ut is faciat, qui nescit quomodo fiat \u2026\nquod nescis quomodo fiat, id non facis)\u201d (MV\n150\u20131). If restricted to the causality of rational, intentional\nagents, the principle seems to have some intuitive appeal. But\nGeulincx, interestingly enough, does not restrict the principle in\nthis way. Rather, he takes it to be universally applicable, even to\nbodily causes, which has raised questions about the plausibility of\nthis overall argument. Malebranche appears to be taking up a version\nof this principle, which we will discuss later in the section on the\n\u201cno representation\u201d argument.\n",
