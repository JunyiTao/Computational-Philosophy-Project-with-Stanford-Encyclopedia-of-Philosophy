    "main_text": "Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism || The Externalists\n1.1 The Externalists\n\nIf one assumes, with the Externalists, that the main goal of a\nlinguistic theory is to develop accurate models of the structural\nproperties of the speech sounds, words, phrases, and other linguistic\nitems, then the clearly privileged information will include corpora\n(written and oral)\u2014bodies of attested and recorded language use\n(suitably idealized). The goal is to describe how this public record\nexhibits certain (perhaps non-phenomenal) patterns that are\nprojectable.\n\nAmerican structural linguistics of the 1920s to 1950s championed the\ndevelopment of techniques for using corpora as a basis for developing\nstructural descriptions of natural languages, although such work was\nreally not practically possible until the wide-spread availability of\ncheap, powerful, and fast computers. Andr\u00e9 Martinet (1960: 1)\nnotes that one of the basic assumptions of structuralist approaches to\nlinguistics is that \u201cnothing may be called\n\u2018linguistic\u2019 that is not manifest or manifested one way or\nanother between the mouth of the speaker and the ears of the\nlistener\u201d. He is, however, quick to point out that \u201cthis\nassumption does not entail that linguists should restrict their field\nof research to the audible part of the communication\nprocess\u2014speech can only be interpreted as such, and not as so\nmuch noise, because it stands for something else that is not\nspeech.\u201d\n\nAmerican structuralists\u2014Leonard Bloomfield in\nparticular\u2014were attacked, sometimes legitimately and sometimes\nillegitimately, by certain factions in the Essentialist tradition. For\nexample, it was perhaps justifiable to criticize Bloomfield for\nadopting a nominalist ontology as popularized by the logical\nempiricists. But he was later attacked by Essentialists for holding\nanti-mentalist views about linguistics, when it is arguable that his\nactual view was that the science of linguistics should not commit\nitself to any particular psychological theory. (He had earlier been an\nenthusiast for the mentalist and introspectionist psychology of\nWilhelm Wundt; see Bloomfield 1914.)\n\nExternalism continues to thrive within computational linguistics,\nwhere the American structuralist vison of studying language through\nautomatic analysis of corpora has enjoyed a recrudescence, and very\nlarge, computationally searchable corpora are being used to test\nhypotheses about the structure of languages (see Sampson 2001, chapter\n1, for discussion).\n",
