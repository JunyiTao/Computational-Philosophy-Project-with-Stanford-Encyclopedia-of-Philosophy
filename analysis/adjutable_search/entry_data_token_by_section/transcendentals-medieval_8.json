    "main_text": "Transcendentals and Metaphysics\n6. Transcendentals and Metaphysics\n\n\nWe have noticed that, as medieval doctrines of the transcendentals\nexplain the relation between \u2018being\u2019 and the other\ntranscendental predicates in the predicative model of subject and\nproperty, they obeyed the basic structure of a science and hence gave a\nconcrete elaboration to metaphysics as the science of being as being.\nWe have also noticed that the medieval doctrines of the transcendentals\nfollowed Ibn Sina\u2019s rejection of the theological interpretation\nof the subject of metaphysics and grounded their ontological\ninterpretation of the subject of this science on the identification of\nbeing as the subject of metaphysics and being as first known. As a\nconsequence, the medieval conception of metaphysics was transformed.\nMetaphysics became the \u2018common science\u2019, the\n\u2018transcendental science\u2019, and \u2018first\nphilosophy\u2019 in a new sense. (See Aertsen 2012, 672\u20133.) (i.) The\nscience of being as being that is common to all things was founded by\nIbn Sina on \u2018common being\u2019 as its subject; Thomas Aquinas\naccordingly takes \u2018being in general\u2019 (ens\ncommune) as the subject of metaphysics and makes this science\nthe \u2018common science\u2019 (scientia communis).\n(ii.) Already in the Metaphysics-commentary of Albert the\nGreat, the science of metaphysics is said to deal with the \u2018first\nand transcendental (determinations)\u2019 (prima et\ntranscendentia). Duns Scotus completes this interpretation of\nmetaphysics, by declaring it the \u2018transcendental science\u2019\n(scientia transcendens). (iii) Whereas Aristotle\nfounded the primacy of metaphysics as first philosophy on the nobility\nof the objects it was concerned with, i.e. the highest causes, the\nmedieval foundation of being as the subject of metaphysics on being as\nthe first known generated an entirely new interpretation of the primacy\nof metaphysics: this science is first, because it deals with the first\nconceptions of the mind. Whereas Aristotle\u2019s first philosophy was\nthe most difficult science to learn, metaphysics as the medieval first\nphilosophy is the easiest of sciences, since it deals with the\nself-evident. (cf. Bonetus, Metaph. 2, c. 7)\n\n\nThe relation of doctrines of the transcendentals to the science of\nmetaphysics rests on the recognition that the transcendentals are\nproperties of being qua being, i.e. the basic features of reality.\nHowever, the epistemological aspect of doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, i.e. their status as the first, primitive conceptions\nof the intellect, implicitly compromises the real character of the\ntranscendental properties of being, given that what can be conceived\nexceeds the realm of what is real. Since the identity of the subject of\nfirst philosophy with the first object of the intellect was\nfoundational for the medieval conception of metaphysics, a basic\ninstability underlies the medieval conception of metaphysics and hence\nthe doctrines of the transcendentals: being as the first object of the\nintellect goes beyond the extension of real being as the subject of\nmetaphysics. (See Goris 2008 & 2011) This instability is\nwitnessed by the work of two Scotists in the early 14th century:\nNicolas Bonetus and Francis of Marchia.\n\n\nNicolas Bonetus places the doctrine of the formalities at the center\nof a new, and systematically elaborated, science of metaphysics, which\nfocuses on the doctrine of the transcendentals and reserves the\nconsideration of the divine to natural theology. Bonetus considers the\nconcept of being, insofar as it is univocal to real being and being in\nthe mind, as the subject of metaphysics. From this univocal concept of\nbeing, which signifies some determinate intelligible content distinct\nfrom other intelligible contents, he distinguishes an all-encompassing\nnotion of being which signifies \u201ceverything positive which is\noutside of nothing, whether it is real being, or being in the mind,\nwhether categorical, reducible to categories, or outside of all\ncategories.\u201d The consequence is that \u2018being\u2019 as the\nsubject of metaphysics, as a determinate formality distinct from other\nquiddities, is dissociated from the first object of the intellect, and\nconvertible with the transcendental properties \u2018one\u2019,\n\u2018true\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019 only according to a\ndiminished degree of transcendentality. A comparable tendency can be\nwitnessed in the thought of Francis of Marchia. In answering the\nquestion concerning the first intention of a thing, Francis\ndistinguishes between a material and formal priority of concepts. The\nconcept of \u2018thing\u2019 (res) is the first concept in\nthe sense of material priority, which is related to the priority of the\nsubject of metaphysics. The concept of \u2018something\u2019\n(aliquid) is the first concept in the sense of formal\npriority, which is related to the priority of the object of the\nintellect. The dissociation of the subject of metaphysics and the first\nobject of the intellect is squared with the dissociation of a general\nmetaphysics, which deals with the transcendentals and builds the road\ntoward a special metaphysics, which deals with the divine. (See\nFolger-Fonfara 2008.)\n\n\nIn the light of these and later divisions of the science of\nmetaphysics, Suarez\u2019 project in the Disputationes\nmetaphysicae is to be considered a defense of the unity of\nmetaphysics, which nevertheless prolongs the dissociation that caused\nthese divisions. (See Darge 2004). Suarez distinguishes between being\nas the first object of the intellect and being as the proper subject of\nmetaphysics: \u201cbeing insofar as it is real being.\u201d This\nmakes it clear, finally, that the characteristic foundation of medieval\nmetaphysics, i.e. the identity of the subject of first philosophy with\nthe first object of the intellect, did not lead, despite its basic\ninstability, to a \u2018super-transcendental\u2019 metaphysics;\ninstead of sacrificing the realist understanding of metaphysics, the\nmedieval theoreticians of the doctrine of the transcendentals attacked\nthe identity of the subject of first philosophy with the first object\nof the intellect. Underlying the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals from Aquinas to Su\u00e1rez, therefore, is the\nrealist understanding of metaphysics as a \u2018science of the\nreal\u2019 (scientia realis).\n",
