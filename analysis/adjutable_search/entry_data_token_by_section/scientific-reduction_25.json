    "main_text": "Unresolved issues || Reduction and explanation\n5.1 Reduction and explanation\n\nPhilosophers do not agree upon the relation between reduction and\nexplanation. Some argue that the concept of reduction is on a par with\nconcepts such as causation in that it is intimately tied to certain\n\u2018because\u2019, \u2018in virtue of\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019\nstatements, or that there is no fundamental split between explanatory\nand ontological models of reduction (van Riel 2011; McCauley 1981).\nOthers have held that not only is there a difference between\nexplanatory reduction, which is an epistemological matter, and\nontological reductionism, but that there might even be a difference\nbetween explanatory reduction and derivation-based models of theory\nreduction (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology;\n see also Klein 2009; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010).\n\nFor notions of reduction that are connected to explanation, the\ndifferent options are, apparently, these:\n\nThe notion of reduction is itself an explanatory concept,\nin the sense that it is a concept which is to be cashed out in terms\nof explanatory concepts: stating that a reduces to\nb, one states that b is explanatorily tied\nto a.\n The reduction relation is an explanatory relation,\ndespite the fact that the concept is not to be cashed out using\nexplanatory notions: that a reduces to b merely\nimplies that b is explanatorily tied to a.\n\n\nIf the concept of reduction is an explanatory concept, then a\ndefinition of it is either of the form [\u2026 because\n\u2026], or it relevantly involves an analysis of explanatory\nnotions. If it is not, but still is such that the relation is\nexplanatory, then a definition would at least imply the truth of a\ncorresponding explanation.\n\nGiven this broad outline, it seems reasonable to assume that most\nmodels of reduction are concerned with explanation in one of these\nsenses. Possible exceptions would include models that highlight\nreplacement issues, where an apparent phenomenon is not explained but\nrather \u201cexplained away\u201d, and perhaps some more technical\nnotions of reduction that are guided neither by intuitions of the\n\u201cnothing over and above\u201d sort, nor by any metaphysical\npositions such as functionalism (e.g., Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010;\nBickle 2008; Butterfield 2011a&b).\n",
