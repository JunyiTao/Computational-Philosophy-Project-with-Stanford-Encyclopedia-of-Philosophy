    "main_text": "\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard (1924\u20131998) was a French\nphilosopher whose best known work\u2014often to his chagrin\u2014was\nhis 1979 The Postmodern Condition. Written at the request of\nthe Council of Universities of the Provincial Government of Quebec on\nthe state of knowledge in the contemporary world, this work brought\nthe term \u201cpostmodernism\u201d, already in use in other fields,\nsuch as the arts and literature, to the forefront of debates in\nWestern philosophy, especially when published in English in 1984. The\nbook was more prescient than realized at the time, as described below,\nthough soon critics of Continental philosophy used the term\n\u201cpostmodernism\u201d to hold together a variety of thinkers\noften at odds with one another (Julia Kristeva, Michel Foucault,\nJacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and so on). These critics argued that\npostmodernists believed that were no such things as\n\u201cfacts\u201d, only modes of discourse that forever block us\nfrom making truth claims about reality, and the term\n\u201cpostmodern\u201d became a pejorative term to deride these\nthinkers as adhering to epistemological and moral nihilism. While\nLyotard was surely interested in the postmodern loss of\n\u201cmetanarratives\u201d\u2014traditional means by which we order\nworld\u2014his works, especially after The Postmodern\nCondition, considered ways to think of justice after the loss of\nthese metanarratives. In works such as Just Gaming (1979) and\nespecially his masterwork, The Differend (1983), Lyotard\noffers not an \u201canything goes\u201d relativism, but rather takes\nup the historical fact that after the Shoah, there is no longer a\nbelief in the progress of history, \u00e0 la G. W. F. Hegel\n(1770\u20131831) (and even more so today, when polls all over the\nWest show that many believe the next generation will be worse off than\nthe last) while there is also what Hannah Arendt (1906\u20131975)\ncalled a general \u201closs of authority\u201d in traditional\ninstitutions. Hence both progressive and conservative political views\nare found flailing in diagnosing the problems of the political,\nespecially when facing the devaluation of all values in consumer\nculture. The range of Lyotard\u2019s works were not limited to\ndiagnosing the politics of postmodernity, but also made important\ncontributions to aesthetics, the philosophy of science, and the\nphilosophy of language, among other areas.\n",
