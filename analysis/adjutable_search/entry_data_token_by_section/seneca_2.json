    "main_text": "Seneca\u2019s Stoicism || The World of Philosophy: Seneca\u2019s Cosmopolitanism\n2.2 The World of Philosophy: Seneca\u2019s Cosmopolitanism\n\nSeneca tells us that there is a much-debated choice between three\nkinds of life\u2014the life of theory, the life of politics (or\npractice), and the life of pleasure. This is not a Stoic distinction.\nRather, it is (by Seneca\u2019s time) a conventional division, going\nback, on the one hand, to Aristotle\u2019s discussion of the life of\ntheoria (\u2018contemplation\u2019) as compared to the life\nof politics, and on the other hand to Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s engagement with prominent views about the good (the\ngood is pleasure, the good is honor, the good is wisdom). Seneca is\nnot committed to the view that the life of theory is a different life\nfrom the life of practice. But the Aristotelian way of framing the\nquestion helps him describe choices which he and some of his\naddressees face in life: whether to retire from an active role in\npolitics, or to single-mindedly pursue one\u2019s political career\n(for a discussion of traditional interpretations, which aim to explain\nSeneca\u2019s views on retirement in the context of his biography,\nsee Williams 2003).\n\nIn On the Private Life and in On Peace of Mind,\nSeneca addresses this very question of how to choose between the\nactive life of politics, and a life devoted to philosophy. The choice\nis, for Seneca, partly about the right kind of balance. How much do we\nneed to retreat in order to be at peace with ourselves? Philosophy has\ntwo functions. We need philosophical insight on which to base our\nactions. But we also need to devote time specifically to reflecting on\nsuch truths as that only virtue is good, and thus restore our peace of\nmind (cf. On Peace of Mind 2.4 for a description of\ntranquility).\n\nBoth philosophy and politics are spheres in which we can benefit\nothers (On Peace of Mind 3.1\u20133). The contrast between\nthe life of theory and the life of politics helps Seneca spell out his\nversion of Stoic cosmopolitanism. We should not think of the choice\nbetween philosophy and politics as a choice between theory and\npractice. Rather, philosophy and politics represent two worlds that we\nsimultaneously belong to. The world of politics is our local world;\nthe world of philosophy is the whole world. By pursuing an active\ncareer in politics, we aim to do good to the people in our vicinity.\nBy retreating into philosophy we choose to live, for a while,\npredominantly in the world at large (Wildberger 2018a). By studying,\nteaching, and writing philosophy, Seneca thinks, we help others who\nare not necessarily spatially close to us. Philosophical study is\nbeneficial (or \u2018of benefit\u2019), it is of use to others, in\nthe world-wide community to which we all belong (On the Private\nLife 3.4\u20134.2).\n\nWhile Seneca takes it for granted that cosmopolitanism is concerned\nwith the idea that it is good to benefit others, he does not seem to\nthink that cosmopolitanism burdens us with the unfeasible task of\nhelping everyone. Rather, cosmopolitanism liberates us. As things may\nplay out in our individual lives, we may be in a better position to\nbenefit others as philosophers than as Roman senators; and since both\nare good things to do, we can in fact be content with our lives either\nway. Cosmopolitanism creates a beneficial form of life that a narrower\npolitical picture may not accommodate: not only those who happen to be\nappreciated in their own states can benefit others (cf.\nLetter 68.2; cf. Williams 2003, 10\u201311 and 19\u201324).\nIn On the Private Life 3.5, Seneca says: \u201cWhat is\nrequired, you see, of any man is that he should be of use to other\nmen\u2014if possible, to many; failing that, to a few; failing that,\nto those nearest him; failing that, to himself.\u201d\n\nIn Stoic philosophy, cosmopolitanism includes a view of the nature of\nhuman beings: human beings are, by virtue of the kind of beings they\nare, connected. Seneca at times explores fellowship among human beings\nin terms of family relationships. The family in a conventional sense\nis a place of ethical learning. Beyond this, there is an idealized and\nbroader familial relation among people and Seneca is open to the idea\nthat one chooses one\u2019s intellectual ancestors independent of\nbiological relationships (Gloyn 2017). The Stoics see human beings as\nparts of a whole, namely as parts of the cosmos (Vogt 2008, chapter\n2). Seneca fully embraces this idea. In On Benefits, a\ntreatise concerned with beneficere as a social practice, but\nalso, more literally, with beneficere understood as\n\u2018doing good,\u2019 Seneca asks in which ways God benefits human\nbeings. His answer aims to explain why, though we do not have the\nnatural weapons other animals have and are in many ways weaker than\nthey are, human beings have the kind of standing in the world he takes\nthem to have, the standing of \u201cmasters.\u201d \u201cGod has\ngranted two things that make this vulnerable creature the strongest of\nall: reason and fellowship. [\u2026] Fellowship has given him power\nover all animals [\u2026] Remove fellowship and you will destroy the\nunity of mankind on which our life depends.\u201d (tr. Griffin/Inwood\n2011, 4.18.2\u20133). Seneca\u2019s focus on fellowship is in line\nwith earlier Stoic thought about affiliation\n(oikei\u00f4sis) between human beings, as well as with the\nStoic view that the cosmos is a large animal with us as some of its\nparts. Ideally, human beings relate as friends to each other. On the\northodox Stoic conception of friendship, only wise and virtuous people\nare friends (Vogt 2008, 148\u2013160). Seneca endorses this ambitious\nnotion of friendship. In order to be a friend, one must first attain a\nconsistent mindset (Letter 35.2 and 4, cf. Wildberger 2018b).\n\n",
