    "main_text": "\n\nLiberalism is more than one thing. On any close examination, it seems\nto fracture into a range of related but sometimes competing visions.\nIn this entry we focus on debates within the liberal tradition. (1) We\ncontrast three interpretations of liberalism\u2019s core commitment\nto liberty. (2) We contrast \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019\nliberalism. (3) We ask whether liberalism is a\n\u2018comprehensive\u2019 or a \u2018political\u2019 doctrine. (4)\nWe close with questions about the \u2018reach\u2019 of liberalism\n\u2014 does it apply to all humankind? Must all political communities\nbe liberal? Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying\nNo? Could a liberal coherently answer this question by saying Yes?\n",
