    "main_text": "The Question of Justification || Communication theories\n6. Conclusion\n\nRetributive justice has a deep grip on the punitive intuitions of most\npeople. Nevertheless, it has been subject to wide-ranging criticism.\nArguably the most worrisome criticism is that theoretical accounts\nof why wrongdoers positively deserve hard treatment are inadequate. If\nthey are inadequate, then retributive justice provides an incomplete\ntheory of punishment, one that at most explains why wrongdoers deserve\ncensure. Even the idea that wrongdoers forfeit the right not to be\nsuffer proportional hard treatment might be better explained by appeal\nto other explanations of why hard treatment (1) is instrumentally\nvaluable, and (2) is consistent with respect for the wrongdoer.\n\nThe question is, what alternatives are there? Consider, for example,\nthe proposal to replace moral desert with something like institutional\ndesert, i.e., desert based on what the institution prescribes without\nappeal to a prior notion of moral desert. According to this proposal,\na wrongdoer cannot reasonably complain that institutions that threaten\npunishment if she does wrong, and then follow through on the threat if\nshe is duly convicted of wrongdoing, treat her unjustly (Quinn 1985;\nHill 1999; Finkelstein 2004; Bedau & Kelly 2010 [2019: \u00a74]).\nSurely there is utility in having such institutions, and a person\nwould normally have a fair chance to avoid punishment\u2014with the\nrare exception of false convictions\u2014simply by avoiding\nwrongdoing. Nevertheless, this sort of justification of legal\nor institutional desert cannot straightforwardly explain the\nproportionality limit that forms such a core part of the intuitive\nappeal of retributive justice. To explain why the law may not assign\nwhatever punishments the lawmakers reasonably conclude will produce\nthe best effects overall, the idea of retributive justice may be\nessential.\n\nThis limitation to proportional punishment is central to\nretributivism. The negative desert claim holds that only that much\npunishment may be inflicted, and the positive desert claim holds that\nthat much punishment, but no more, is morally deserved and in\nthat sense respectful of the wrongdoer. Unless one is willing to give\nup on the idea that morality imposes a proportionality limit and on\nthe importance of positive moral desert for justifying punishment up\nto that point as respectful of the individual\u2014both intuitively\ndifficult to give up\u2014there is reason to continue to take notion\nof retributive justice, and the project of justifying it,\nseriously.\n",
