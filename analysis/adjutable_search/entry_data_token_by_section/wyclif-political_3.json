    "main_text": "Dominium in Political Thought Before Wyclif || The Franciscans and Their Opponents\n2.3 The Franciscans and Their Opponents\n\n\nThirty years earlier, in Bonaventure's\nApologia pauperum of 1269, the Franciscans had defined any\nproperty ownership, communal or individual, as inimical to the ideals\nof their Order. The Fall from paradise and the introduction of\nselfishness to human nature makes property ownership of any type,\nprivate or communal, an abberation. For the Franciscans, \u201call things\nbelong to the just\u201d only in the sense that \u201cbelonging\u201d entails\nnon-exclusive sharing (usus pauper), not ownership. Within\nthree decades, the Franciscans were divided on this issue: one party,\nthe Spirituals, demanded that the friars adopt usus pauper as\ntheir ideal of spiritual perfection, while the other, the Conventuals,\nargued for a more lenient interpretation of the Rule. The Spirituals,\nunder the guidance of the philosopher\n John Peter Olivi\n and his follower Ubertino de Casale, outnumbered the Conventuals by\ncentury's end, and had become sufficiently vocal to attract the\nattention of the\n pope.[4]\n John XXII was deeply suspicious of the Spiritual Franciscans'\narguments, perhaps fearing a reappearance of the communitarian\nWaldensian heresy. Private ownership, John argued, was not the result\nof Original Sin, but a gift from God that Adam enjoyed in Paradise and\nwhich the blessed still can enjoy, secure in the knowledge that their\nownership is sanctioned by God's dominium. This argument was\nto have notable consequences. John's eventual controversy with the\nSpiritual's champion,\n William Ockham,\n led to the first important use of the concept of natural right.  But\nfor our analysis, the important thing is that iurisdictio and\nproprietas were united in the concept of\ndominium. Wyclif would make use of the Franciscans' arguments\nfor apostolic poverty, as well as of John XXII's idea that divine\ndominium provides the basis for all human dominium,\nthough in a way that would certainly have displeased both\n parties.[5]\n\n\nBy the 1350s, opponents of the Franciscans had broadened their range\nof criticism to question the legitimacy of the Order itself. Richard\nFitzralph, (d. 1360) wrote De Pauperie Salvatoris, a\nsustained examination of the Franciscans' claim to function without\nsupervision by diocesan bishop in which he argues that if the friars\nrely on the justice of the owners of what they use, they are bound by\nthe same laws that bind the owners.  Thus, if the owners of what the\nfriars use are ecclesiastical, it follows that the friars must obey\necclesiastical\n authority.[6]\n  Fitzralph's position is important here because it argues that grace\nalone is the justification for any instance of dominium in\ncreation, and that all just dominium ultimately relies on\nGod's dominium.  Both serve as cornerstones of Wyclif's\nposition. God's dominium is a natural consequence of the act\nof creating, and with it comes divine governance and conservation of\ncreated being. The rational beings in creation, angels and human\nbeings, enjoy the loan of elements of God's created universe, but this\nis not a divine abdication of ultimate authority since everything is\nstill directly subject to divine dominium.  \n\n\nWhen the nature of the dominium lent to Adam changed with the\nFall, the love defining our natural dominium was affected,\nbut not eradicated. Men devised political dominium to\nregulate property relations, and although sin keeps them from\nrecognizing the borrowed nature of any dominium, it does not\npreclude there being grace-justified property ownership. In some\ncases, God infuses the artificial property-relations that we call\ndominium with sufficient grace to make them generally\nequivalent to prelapsarian dominium. These grace-favored\ncases of human dominium do not replicate the authority of God's\ndominium, but can exhibit the love that characterizes\nit. Fitzralph's expression of the Augustinian papal position makes\ngrace the deciding factor in ownership relations and ultimately in\npolitical authority, both of which had become nested in the term\ndominium. Wyclif's interpretation of the Augustinian position\nwould stretch past arguments about papal authority and the friars,\neven past arguments between popes and kings, to stir the very nature\nof the church as Christ's earthly body. All of this begins, he would\nargue, with an understanding of God's dominium as the causal\nexemplar of created lordship.  \n",
