    "main_text": "Three Arguments for the Doctrine of Religious Restraint || The Argument from Religious Warfare\n3.1 The Argument from Religious Warfare\n\n\nAdvocates of the standard view sometimes commend the DRR on the\ngrounds that conforming to it will help prevent religious warfare and\ncivil strife. According to Robert Audi, for example, \u201cif\nreligious considerations are not appropriately balanced with secular\nones in matters of coercion, there is a special problem: a clash of\nGods vying for social control. Such uncompromising absolutes easily\nlead to destruction and death\u201d (Audi 2000, 103). The concern\nexpressed here, presumably, is this: for all we reasonably believe,\ncitizens who are willing to coerce their compatriots for religious\nreasons will use their political power to advance their sectarian\nagenda\u2014using the power of the state to persecute heretics,\nimpose orthodoxy, and enact stringent morals laws. In so doing, these\ncitizens will thereby provoke determined resistance and civil\nconflict. Such a state of affairs, however, threatens the very\nviability of a liberal democracy and, so, should be avoided at nearly\nall costs. Accordingly, religious believers should exercise restraint\nwhen deliberating about the implementation of coercive\nlaws. Exercising restraint, however, is best accomplished by adhering\nto the DRR.\n\n\nAccording to the liberal critics of the standard view, there are\nseveral problems with this argument. First, the liberal critics\ncontend, while there may have been a genuine threat of confessional\nwarfare in 17th century Western Europe, there is little\nreason to believe that there is any such threat in stable liberal\ndemocracies such as the United States. Why not? Because confessional\nconflict, the liberal critics continue, is typically rooted in\negregious violations of the right to religious freedom, when, for\nexample, people are jailed, tortured, or otherwise abused because of\ntheir religious commitments. John Locke puts the point thus:\n\n\nit is not the diversity of Opinions (which cannot be avoided) but\nthe refusal of Toleration to those that are of different Opinions\n(which might have been granted) that has produced all the Bustles and\nWars, that have been in the Christian World, upon account of Religion.\n(Locke 1983, 155)\n If Locke is correct, then what we need to prevent confessional\nconflict is not compliance with a norm such as the DRR, but firm\ncommitment to the right to religious freedom. A stable liberal\ndemocracy such as the United States is, however, fully committed to\nprotecting the right to religious freedom\u2014and will be for the\nforeseeable future. True enough, there are passionately felt\ndisagreements about how to interpret the right to religious freedom:\nwitness recent conflicts as to whether or not the right to religious\nfreedom should be understood to include the right of religious\nobjectors to be exempted from generally justified state policies (See\nKoppelman 2013; Leiter 2012). But it is difficult to see, the liberal\ncritics claim, that there is a realistic prospect of these\ndisagreements devolving into violent civil conflict.\n\n\n Second, even if there were a realistic prospect of religious\nconflict, liberal critics claim that it is unclear that adhering to\nthe DRR would lower the probability that such a conflict would\noccur. After all, the trigger for religious war\u2014typically, the\nviolation of the right to religious freedom\u2014is not always, or\neven typically, justified by exclusively religious considerations. As\nhistorian Michael Burleigh has argued, secularists have a long history\nof hostility to the right to religious freedom and, presumably, that\nhostility isn't at all grounded in religious considerations (Burleigh\n2007, 135 and, more generally, Burleigh 2005).\n Third, the liberal critics maintain, when religious believers have\nemployed coercive power to violate the right to religious freedom,\nthey themselves rarely have done so in a way that violates the\nDRR. Typically, when such rights have been violated, the\njustifications offered, even by religious believers, appeal to alleged\nrequirements for social order, such as the need for uniformity of\nbelief on basic normative issues. One theological apologist for\nreligious repression, for example, writes this: \u201cThe king\npunishes heretics as enemies, as extremely wicked rebels, who endanger\nthe peace of the kingdom, which cannot be maintained without the unity\nof the faith. That is why they are burnt in Spain\u201d (quoted in\nRivera, 1992, 50).  Ordinarily, the kind of religious persecution that\nengenders religious conflict is legitimated by appeal to secular\nreasons of the sort mandated by the DRR.  (This is the case even when\nreligious actors are the ones who appeal to those secular\nreasons.)\n\n\n Finally, liberal critics point out that\nsome religious believers affirm the right to religious freedom on\nreligious grounds; they take themselves to have powerful religious\nreason to affirm the right of each person to worship as she freely\nchooses, absent state coercion. So, for example, the\n4th century Nestorian Mar Aba: \u201cI am a Christian. I\npreach my faith and want every man to join it. But I want him to\njoin it of his own free will. I use force on no man\u201d (quoted in\nMoffett 1986, 216).\n [8]\nA believer such as Mar Aba might be\nwilling to violate the DRR; however, his violation would, according to\nthe liberal critics, help not to cause religious war but to impede\nit. For Mar Aba's 'sectarian rationale' supports not the violation of religious\nfreedom but its protection.\n",
