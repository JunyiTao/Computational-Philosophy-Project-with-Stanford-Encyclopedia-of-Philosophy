This characterization is\nclearly circular (\u201cno other thing\u201d) and\nparadoxical too, unless the notion of \u201ceach thing\u201d is\nqualified. More satisfactory (though partial) characterizations are\navailable and the idea that such a relation of absolute identity\nexists is commonplace. Some, however, deny that a relation of absolute\nidentity exists. Identity, they say, is relative: It is possible for\nobjects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be the same \\(F\\) and yet not the\nsame \\(G\\) (where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are predicates representing kinds of\nthings\u2014apples, ships, passengers\u2014rather than merely\nproperties of things\u2014colors, shapes). In such a case\n\u201csame\u201d cannot mean absolute identity. For example, the\nsame person might be two different passengers, since one person may be\ncounted twice as a passenger. If to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the\nsame person is to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are persons and are\n(absolutely) identical, and to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different\npassengers is to say that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are passengers and are\n(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain that\nwhile there are such cases of \u201crelative identity\u201d, there\nis also such a thing as absolute identity. According to this view,\nidentity comes in two forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial or\nrelative (Gupta 1980). These maverick views present a serious\nchallenge to the received, absolutist doctrine of identity. In the\nfirst place, cases such as the passenger/person case are more\ndifficult to dismiss than might be supposed (but see below, \u00a73).\nSecondly, the standard view of identity is troubled by many persistent\npuzzles and problems, some of recent and some of ancient origin. The\nrelative identity alternative sheds considerable light on these\nproblems even if it does not promise a resolution of them all.\n\nA word about notation. In what follows, lower-case italic letters\n\u201c\\(x\\)\u201d, \u201c\\(y\\)\u201d, etc., are used informally\neither as variables (bound or free) or as (place-holders for)\nindividual constants. The context should make clear which usage is in\nplay. Occasionally, for emphasis or in deference to logical tradition,\nother expressions for individual constants are employed. Also, the\nuse/mention distinction is not strictly observed; but again the\ncontext should resolve any ambiguity.\n", "toc": [{"#StanAccoIden": "1.

The Standard Account of Identity\n\n[Note: The following material is somewhat technical. The reader may\nwish to casually review it now and return to it as needed, especially\nin connection with \u00a75. The propositions \\(\\text{Ref},\n\\text{LL}, \\text{Ref}', \\text{LL}', \\text{NI}\\), and\n\\(\\text{ND}\\) are identified in the present section and are referred\nto as such in the rest of the entry.]\n\nIdentity may be formalized in the language \\(L\\) of classical\nfirst-order logic (FOL) by selecting a two-place predicate of \\(L\\),\nrewriting it as \u201c=\u201d, and adopting the universal closures\nof the following two postulates: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{\\(\\text{Ref}\\)} x &= x \\\\ \n \\tag{\\(\\text{LL}\\)} x &= y \\rightarrow[\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi(y)] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nwhere the formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) is like the formula \\(\\phi(y)\\) except\nfor having occurrences of \\(x\\) at some or all of the places\n\\(\\phi(y)\\) has occurrences of \\(y\\) (see Enderton 2000, for a precise\ndefinition). Ref is the principle of the reflexivity of\nidentity and LL (Leibniz\u2019 Law) is the principle of\nthe indiscernibility of identicals. It says in effect that\nidentical objects cannot differ in any respect. The other\ncharacteristic properties of identity, symmetry \\((x = y\n\\rightarrow y = x)\\), and transitivity \\((x = y \\amp y = z\n\\rightarrow x = z)\\), may be deduced from Ref and LL. Any relation\nthat is reflexive, transitive, and symmetric is called an\n\u201cequivalence relation\u201d. Thus, identity is an equivalence\nrelation satisfying LL. But not all equivalence relations satisfy LL.\nFor example, the relation x and y are the same size is an\nequivalence relation that does not satisfy LL (with respect to a rich\nlanguage such as English).\n\nLet \\(E\\) be an equivalence relation defined on a set \\(A\\). For \\(x\\)\nin \\(A\\), \\([x]\\) is the set of all \\(y\\) in \\(A\\) such that \\(E(x,\ny)\\); this is the equivalence class of x determined by E. The\nequivalence relation \\(E\\) divides the set \\(A\\) into mutually\nexclusive equivalence classes whose union is \\(A\\). The family of such\nequivalence classes is called \u201cthe partition of \\(A\\) induced by\n\\(E\\)\u201d.\n\nNow let \\(A\\) be a set and define the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) as\nfollows: For \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(A\\), \\(I(A,x,y)\\) if and only if for\neach subset \\(X\\) of \\(A\\), either \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are both elements\nof \\(X\\) or neither is an element of \\(X\\). This definition is\nequivalent to the more usual one identifying the identity relation on\na set \\(A\\) with the set of ordered pairs of the form \\(\\langle\nx,x\\rangle\\) for \\(x\\) in \\(A\\). The present definition proves more\nhelpful in what follows.\n\nSuppose for the moment that we do not assign any special\ninterpretation to the identity symbol. We treat it like any other\ntwo-place predicate. Let \\(M\\) be a structure for \\(L\\) and assume\nthat Ref and LL are true in \\(M\\). Call the relation defined in \\(M\\)\nby the conjunction of Ref and LL \u201cindiscernibility\u201d (see\nEnderton 2000, for the definition of definability in a structure).\nThere are three important points to note about the relationship\nbetween indiscernibility, and the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\). First,\nindiscernibility need not be the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) (where \\(A\\) is\nthe domain of the structure). It might be an equivalence relation\n\\(E\\) having the property that for some elements \\(u,v\\), of the\ndomain, \\(E(u,v)\\) holds, although \\(I(A,u,v)\\) fails. Secondly, there\nis no way to \u201ccorrect for\u201d this possibility. There is no\nsentence or set of sentences that could be added to the list beginning\nwith Ref and LL that would guarantee that indiscernibility coincides\nwith \\(I(A,x,y)\\). This fact is usually expressed by saying that\nidentity is not a first-order or \u201celementary\u201d relation.\n(For a proof, see Hodges 1983.) However, in a language such as set\ntheory (as usually interpreted) or second-order logic, in which there\nis a quantifier \u201call \\(X\\)\u201d permitting quantification over\nall subsets of a given set, \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is definable (Freund\n2019).\n\nThird, given any structure \\(M\\) for \\(L\\) in which Ref and LL are\ntrue, there is a corresponding structure \\(\\textit{QM}\\), the\n\u201cquotient structure\u201d determined by \\(M\\), in which\nindiscernibility does coincide with \\(I(A,x,y)\\).\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\) is obtained in roughly the following way: Let the\nelements of \\(\\textit{QM}\\) be the equivalence classes \\([x]\\), for\nelements \\(x\\) of \\(M\\) determined by indiscernibility in \\(M\\). If\n\\(F\\) is a one-place predicate true in \\(M\\) of some object \\(x\\) in\n\\(M\\), then define \\(F\\) to be true of \\([x]\\) in \\(\\textit{QM}\\), and\nsimilarly for many-place predicates and constants. It can then be\nshown that any sentence true in \\(M\\) is true in \\(\\textit{QM}\\), and\nvice versa. The existence of quotient structures makes it possible to\ntreat the identity symbol as a logical constant interpreted in terms\nof \\(I(A,x,y)\\). There is in fact in general no other way to\nguarantee that Ref and LL will hold in every structure. (As\nQuine [1970] points out, however, a finite language will\nalways contain a predicate satisfying Ref and LL in any structure; cf.\nHodges 1983.) The alternative, however, is to view FOL with Ref and LL\n(FOL=) as a proper theory in whose models (structures in\nwhich Ref and LL hold) there will be an equivalence relation \\(E\\)\nsuch that if \\(E(x,y)\\) holds, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) will be\nindiscernible with respect to the defined subsets of the\ndomain. But we cannot in general assume that every subset of the\ndomain is definable. If the domain is infinite, \\(L\\) runs out of\ndefining formulas long before the domain runs out of subsets.\nNonetheless, a strong metatheorem asserts that any set of formulas\nthat has a model, has a countable (finite or denumerable) model. This\nmeans that the difference between indiscernibility and \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is\nminimized at least to the extent that, for a sufficiently rich\nlanguage such as \\(L\\), the valid formulas concerning indiscernibility\n(i.e., the formulas true in every model of what is termed below\n\u201cthe pure \\(L\\)-theory with identity\u201d) coincide with the\nvalid formulas concerning \\(I(A,x,y)\\). (See Epstein 2001 for a sketch\nof a proof of this fact.) This is not to say, however, that there\nisn\u2019t a significant difference between identity qua\nindiscernibility and identity qua \\(I(A,x,y)\\) (see below).\nBoth points of view\u2014that FOL= is a proper theory and\nthat it is a logic\u2014may be found in the literature (Quine 1970).\nThe latter is the more usual view and it will count here as part of\nthe standard account of identity.\n\nAssume that \\(L'\\) is some fragment of \\(L\\) containing a subset of\nthe predicate symbols of \\(L\\) and the identity symbol. Let \\(M\\) be a\nstructure for \\(L'\\) and suppose that some identity statement \\(a =\nb\\) (where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are individual constants) is true in \\(M\\),\nand that Ref and LL are true in \\(M\\). Now expand \\(M\\) to a structure\n\\(M'\\) for a richer language\u2014perhaps \\(L\\) itself. That is,\nassume we add some predicates to \\(L'\\) and interpret them as usual in\n\\(M\\) to obtain an expansion \\(M'\\) of \\(M\\). Assume that Ref and LL\nare true in \\(M'\\) and that the interpretation of the terms \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) remains the same. Is \\(a = b\\) true in \\(M'\\)? That depends. If\nthe identity symbol is treated as a logical constant, the answer is\n\u201cyes\u201d. But if it is treated as a non-logical symbol, then\nit can happen that \\(a = b\\) is false in \\(M'\\). The indiscernibility\nrelation defined by the identity symbol in \\(M\\) may differ from the\none it defines in \\(M'\\); and in particular, the latter may be more\n\u201cfine-grained\u201d than the former. In this sense, if identity\nis treated as a logical constant, identity is not\n\u201clanguage relative\u201d; whereas if identity is treated as a\nnon-logical notion, it \\(is\\) language relative. For this reason we\ncan say that, treated as a logical constant, identity is\n\u201cunrestricted\u201d. For example, let \\(L'\\) be a fragment of\n\\(L\\) containing only the identity symbol and a single one-place\npredicate symbol; and suppose that the identity symbol is treated as\nnon-logical. The formula \n\\[ \\forall x\\forall y\\forall z(x = y \\vee x = z \\vee y = z) \\]\n\n\nis then true in any structure for \\(L'\\) in which Ref and LL are true.\nThe reason is that the unique one-place predicate of \\(L'\\) divides\nthe domain of a structure into those objects it satisfies and those it\ndoes not. Hence, at least two of any group of three objects will be\nindiscernible. On the other hand, if the identity symbol is\ninterpreted as \\(I(A,x,y)\\), this formula is false in any structure\nfor \\(L'\\) with three or more elements.\n\nIf we do wish to view identity as a non-logical notion, then the\nphenomenon of language relativity suggests that it is best not to\nformalize identity using a single identity predicate \u201c=\u201d.\nInstead, we have the following picture: We begin with a language \\(L\\)\nand define an L-theory with identity to be a theory whose\nlogical axioms are those of FOL and which is such that \\(L\\) contains\na two-place predicate \\(E_L\\) satisfying the non-logical axiom\n\\(\\textrm{Ref}\\,'\\) and the non-logical axiom schema\n\\(\\textrm{LL}'\\) \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{\\(\\text{Ref}\\,'\\)} &E_L (x,x) \\\\\n \\tag{\\(\\text{LL}'\\)} &E_L (x,y) \\rightarrow (\\phi(x) \\rightarrow \\phi(y)). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe pure \\(L\\)-theory with identity is the \\(L\\)-theory whose\nsole non-logical axiom is \\(\\textrm{Ref}\\,'\\) and whose sole\nnon-logical axiom schema is \\(\\textrm{LL}'\\).\n\nNow the phenomenon of language relativity can be described more\naccurately as follows. Let \\(L_1\\) be a sublanguage of \\(L_2\\) and\nassume that \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) are, respectively, the pure\n\\(L_1\\)-theory with identity and the pure \\(L_2\\)-theory with\nidentity. Let \\(M_1\\) and \\(M_2\\) be models of \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\),\nrespectively, having the same domain. Assume that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are\nindividual constants having the same interpretation in \\(M_1\\) and\n\\(M_2\\). Let \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) be the identity symbols of \\(L_1\\)\nand \\(L_2\\). It can happen that \\(E_1 (a,b)\\) is true in \\(M_1\\) but\n\\(E_2 (a,b)\\) is false in \\(M_2\\). We can then say, with Geach (1967;\nsee \u00a74) and others, that the self-same objects indiscernible\naccording to one theory may be discernible according to another.\n\nThere are two further philosophically significant features of the\nstandard account of identity. First, identity is a necessary\nrelation: If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rigid terms (terms whose reference\ndoes not vary with respect to parameters such as time or possible\nworld) then\n\n(NI)\n If \\(a = b\\) is true, then it is necessarily true. \n\n\nAssuming certain modal principles, the necessity of distinctness (ND)\nfollows from NI.\n\n(ND)\n If \\(a \\ne b\\) is true, then it is necessarily true. \n\n\nNote that the necessary truth of \\(a = b\\) does not imply the\nnecessary existence of objects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). We may assume that what\na rigid term \\(a\\) denotes at a possible world (or moment of time)\n\\(w\\) need not exist in \\(w\\). Secondly, we do not ordinarily say\nthings of the form \u201c\\(x\\) is the same as \\(y\\)\u201d. Instead,\nwe say \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person\u201d or\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same book\u201d. The standard view is\nthat the identity component of such statements is just \u201c\\(x\\) is\nthe same as \\(y\\)\u201d. For example, according to the standard view,\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person\u201d reduces to\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are persons and \\(x\\) is the same as \\(y\\)\u201d,\nwhere the second conjunct may be\nformalized as in FOL=.\n2. Paradoxes of Identity\n\nThe concept of identity, simple and settled though it may seem (as\ncharacterized by the standard account), gives rise to a great deal of\nphilosophical perplexity. A few (by no means all) of the salient\nproblems are outlined below. These are presented in the form of\nparadoxes\u2014arguments from apparently undeniable premises to\nobviously unacceptable conclusions. The aim here is to make clear just\nwhat options are available to one who would stick close to the\nstandard account. Often (but not always) little or no defense or\ncritique of any particular option is offered. In the next section, we\nshall see what the relative identity alternative offers by\ncomparison.\n2.1 The Paradox of Change\n\nThe most fundamental puzzle about identity is the problem of change.\nSuppose we have two photographs of a dog, Oscar. In one, \\(A\\), Oscar\nis a puppy, in the other, \\(B\\), he is old and gray-muzzled. Yet we\nhold that he is the same dog, in, it appears, direct violation of LL.\nMore explicitly, \\(B\\) is a photograph of an old dog with a gray\nmuzzle; \\(A\\) is a photograph of a young dog without a gray muzzle.\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are photographs of the same dog. But according to LL,\nif the dog in \\(B\\) has a property (e.g., having a gray muzzle) that\nthe dog in \\(A\\) lacks, then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not\nphotographs of the same dog. Contradiction.\n\nVarious solutions have been proposed. The most popular are the\nfollowing two: (1) Simple properties such as having or lacking a gray\nmuzzle are actually relations to times. Oscar has the property of\nlacking a gray muzzle at time t and the property of having a\ngray muzzle at (a later) \\(t'\\); but there is no incompatibility,\nsince being thus and so related to time \\(t\\) and not being thus and\nso related to time \\(t'\\) are compatible conditions, and hence change\ninvolves no violation of LL. (2) Oscar is an object that is extended\nin time as well as space. The puppy Oscar and old gray-muzzled Oscar\nare distinct temporal parts or stages of the whole temporally extended\nOscar. Both photographs are therefore not photographs of the whole\nOscar at all because there cannot be still photographs of Oscar.\n\nThese proposals may seem plausible, and indeed most philosophers\nsubscribe to one or other of them. The most common\nobjections\u2014that on the temporal parts account, objects are not\n\u201cwholly present\u201d at any given time, and that on the\nrelations-to-times account, seemingly simply properties of objects,\nsuch as Oscar having a gray muzzle, are complicated relations\u2014do\nlittle more than affirm what their targets deny. Yet the objections\nare an attempt to give voice to a strong intuition concerning our\nexperience as creatures existing in time. Both (1) and (2) treat time\nand change from a \u201cGod\u2019s eye\u201d point of view. (1)\npresupposes time laid out \u201call at once\u201d, so to speak, and\nsimilarly for (2). But we experience no such thing. Instead, while we\nare prepared to wait to see the whole of a baseball game we are\nwatching, we are not prepared to wait to see the whole of a painting\nwe are viewing.\n2.2 Chrysippus\u2019 Paradox\n\nThe following paradox\u2014a variation of the paradox of\nchange\u2014raises some new questions. It is due to the Stoic\nphilosopher Chrysippus (c. 280 BCE \u2013 c. 206 BCE) and has been\nresurrected by Michael Burke (1994). In Chrysippus\u2019s example,\n\u201cDion\u201d is the name of a human and \u201cTheon\u201d is\nthe name of the proper part of Dion that includes everything but his\n[Dion\u2019s] left foot. Dion then loses his foot and Chrysippus\nwishes to know which of those objects\u2014Dion or\nTheon\u2014survives after Dion loses the foot. Burke\u2019s example\nis to suppose that, at some point \\(t'\\) in the future, poor Oscar\nwill lose his tail. He then considers the proper part of Oscar, as he\nis now (at \\(t)\\), consisting of the whole of Oscar minus his tail.\nCall this object \u201cOscar\u2212\u201d. According to\nthe standard account of identity, Oscar and Oscar\u2212\nare distinct at \\(t\\) and hence, by ND, they are distinct at \\(t'\\).\n(Intuitively, Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are distinct at \\(t'\\)\nsince Oscar has a property at \\(t'\\) that Oscar\u2212\nlacks, namely, the property of having had a tail at \\(t\\). Notice that\nthis argument involves a tacit appeal to ND\u2014or NI, depending on\nhow you look at it.) Hence, if both survive, we have a case of two\ndistinct physical objects occupying exactly the same space at the same\ntime. Assuming that is impossible, and assuming, as commonsense\ndemands, that Oscar survives the loss of his tail, it follows that\nOscar\u2212 does not survive. This conclusion is\nparadoxical because it appears that nothing happens to\nOscar\u2212 in the interval between \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) that\nwould cause it to perish.\n\nThe first group of solutions does not take into consideration the\namputation event that occurred at \\(t'\\) when they account for what\nexists\u2014you may dub them untemporalized solutions. One\nextreme option in this category is to deny that there are such things\nas Oscar\u2212. Undetached proper parts of objects\ndon\u2019t exist (van Inwagen 1981). A less extreme version allows\nfor commonsense undetached parts, like tails or feet\u2014of course\nOscar\u2212 does not belong to this category, so it does\nnot exist (Carmichael 2020). On the other hand, a more extreme option\nis to deny the existence of both Oscar and\nOscar\u2212\u2014this may follow from some reductionist\nview like the one that only elementary particles exist. A third, less\nextreme, option is to insist that objects of different kinds,\ne.g., a clay statue and the piece of clay it is composed of,\ncan occupy the same space at the same time, but objects of\nthe same kind, e.g., two statues, cannot (Wiggins 1968; for\nrefinements, see Oderberg 1996). So Oscar and Oscar\u2212\nare different despite the fact that from \\(t'\\) onwards they occupy\nthe same space. Guillon (2021) notes that there are three varieties of\nthis colocationist view. First, one may maintain that they are\ndifferent despite sharing all parts: every proper part of Oscar is a\nproper part of Oscar\u2212 and vice versa. The\nsecond colocationist variety allows for two different material objects\nto be sums of the same set of material objects\u2014so Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 may be different although they are ultimately\ncomposed of the same particles. Finally, one of them, most probably\nOscar\u2212, may be considered a proper part of the other.\nObviously, these three options are meaningful only if one does\nnot assume the full strength of\n general existentional mereology.\n The last global option is to claim that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are two distinct temporally extended\nobjects\u2014a dog part, Oscar\u2212, and a dog, Oscar,\nwhich overlaps at \\(t'\\). Temporal parts of distinct objects can\noccupy the same space at the same time.\n\nThe solutions in the second group, temporalized solutions,\nrecognize the world\u2019s ontological inventory has changed at\n\\(t'\\). For instance, Chrysippus, according to Philo of Alexandria,\nclaimed that \u201cit is necessary that Dion remains while Theon has\nperished\u201d (Long and Sedley 1987, p. 172), so Dion exists\nthroughout the whole period, but Theon dies at \\(t'\\). Accepting some\nkind of mereological essentialism (Chisholm 1973), one may hold an\nopposite view: since all parts are essential to Oscar, the amputation\nevent killed Oscar while Oscar\u2212 either was created by\nthe event or enjoyed existence throughout the whole period in question.\nThen you may maintain that the event at \\(t'\\) either (i) brought\nOscar\u2212 into existence or (ii) did not disrupt\nOscar\u2212\u2019s prior existence (i.e.,\nOscar\u2212 existed at all times from \\(t\\) to \\(t'\\)).\nFinally, a proponent of\n contingent identity\n may claim that at t Oscar is different from\nOscar\u2212, but at \\(t'\\) they become identical. \n2.3 The Paradox of 101 Dalmatians\n\n(This paradox is also known as the paradox of 1001 cats; Geach 1980,\nLewis 1993.) Focus on Oscar and Oscar\u2212 at\n\\(t\\)\u2014before Oscar loses his tail. Is Oscar\u2212 a\ndog? When Oscar loses his tail the resulting creature is certainly a\ndog. Why then should we deny that Oscar\u2212 is a dog? We\nsaw above that one possible response to Chrysippus\u2019 paradox was\nto claim that Oscar\u2212 does not exist from \\(t'\\) on.\nBut even if we adopt this view, how does it follow that\nOscar\u2212, existing as it does at \\(t\\), is not a dog?\nYet if Oscar\u2212 is a dog, then, given the standard\naccount of identity, there are two dogs where we would normally count\nonly one. In fact, for each of Oscar\u2019s hairs, of which there are\nat least 101, there is a proper part of Oscar\u2014Oscar minus a\nhair\u2014which is just as much a dog as Oscar\u2212.\nThere are then at least 101 dogs (and in fact many more) where we\nwould count only one. Some claim that things such as dogs are\n\u201cmaximal\u201d. No proper part of a dog is a dog (Burke 1993).\nOne might conclude as much simply to avoid multiplying the number of\ndogs populating the space reserved for Oscar alone. But the maximality\nprinciple may seem to be independently justified as well. When Oscar\nbarks, do all these different dogs bark in unison? If a thing is a\ndog, shouldn\u2019t it be capable of independent action? Yet\nOscar\u2212 cannot act independently of Oscar.\nNevertheless, David Lewis (1993) has suggested a reason for counting\nOscar\u2212 and all the 101 dog parts that differ (in\nvarious different ways) from one another and Oscar by a hair, as dogs,\nand in fact as Dalmatians (Oscar is a Dalmatian). Lewis invokes\nUnger\u2019s (1980) \u201cproblem of the many\u201d. Oscar sheds\ncontinuously but gradually. His hairs loosen and then dislodge, some\nsuch remaining still in place. Hence, within Oscar\u2019s compass at\nany given time there are congeries of Dalmatian parts sooner or later\nto become definitely Dalmatians; some in a day, some in a second, or a\nsplit second. It seems arbitrary to proclaim a Dalmatian part that is\na split second away from becoming definitely a Dalmatian, a Dalmatian,\nwhile denying that one a day away is a Dalmatian. As Lewis puts it, we\nmust either deny that the \u201cmany\u201d are Dalmatians, or we\nmust deny that the Dalmatians are many. Lewis endorses proposals of\nboth types but seems to favor one of the latter type according to\nwhich the Dalmatians are not many but rather \u201calmost one\u201d.\nIn any case, the standard account of identity seems unable on its own\nto handle the paradox of 101 Dalmatians. It requires that we either\ndeny that Oscar minus a hair is a dog\u2014and a Dalmatian\u2014or\nelse that we must affirm that there is a multiplicity of Dalmatians,\nall but one of which is incapable of independent action and all of\nwhich bark in unison no more loudly than Oscar barks alone.\n2.4 The Paradox of Constitution\n\nSuppose that on day 1 Jones purchases a piece of clay \\(c\\) and\nfashions it into a statue \\(s_1.\\) On day 2, Jones destroys \\(s_1\\),\nbut not \\(c\\), by squeezing \\(s_1\\) into a ball and fashions a new\nstatue \\(s_2\\) out of \\(c\\). On day 3, Jones removes a part of\n\\(s_2\\), discards it, and replaces it using a new piece of clay,\nthereby destroying \\(c\\) and replacing it by a new piece of clay,\n\\(c'\\). Presumably, \\(s_2\\) survives this change. Now what is the\nrelationship between the pieces of clay and the statues they\n\u201cconstitute\u201d? A natural answer is: identity. On day \\(1,\nc\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\) and on day \\(2, c\\) is identical to\n\\(s_2\\). On day \\(3, s_2\\) is identical to \\(c'\\). But this conclusion\ndirectly contradicts NI. If, on day \\(1, c\\) is (identical to)\n\\(s_1\\), then it follows, given NI, that on day \\(2, s_1\\) is \\(s_2\\)\n(since \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_2\\) on day 2) and hence that \\(s_1\\)\nexists on day 2, which it does not. By a similar argument, on day \\(3,\nc\\) is \\(c'\\) (since \\(s_2\\) is identical to both) and so \\(c\\) exists\non day 3, which it does not. We might conclude, then, that either\nconstitution is not identity or that NI is false. Neither conclusion\nis wholly welcome. Once we adopt the standard account less NI, the\nlatter principle follows directly from the assumption that individual\nvariables and constants in quantified modal logic are to be handled\nexactly as they are in first-order logic. And if constitution is not\nidentity, and yet statues, as well as pieces of clay, are physical\nobjects (and what else would they be?), then we are again forced to\naffirm that distinct physical objects may occupy (exactly) the same\nspace at the same time. The statue \\(s_1\\) and the piece of clay \\(c\\)\noccupy the same space on day 1. Even if this is deemed possible\n(Wiggins 1980), it is unparsimonious. The standard account is thus\nprima facie incompatible with the natural idea that\nconstitution is identity.\n\nPhilosophers have not argued by direct appeal to NI or ND. Typically\n(e.g., Gibbard 1975, Noonan 1993, Johnston 1992), arguments that \\(c\\)\nand \\(s_1\\) are not identical run as follows: \\(c\\) exists prior to\nthe existence of \\(s_1\\) and hence the two are not identical. Again,\n\\(s_1\\) possesses the property of being such that it will be destroyed\nby being squeezed into a ball, but \\(c\\) does not possess this\nproperty \\((c\\) will be squeezed into a ball but it will not thereby\nbe destroyed). So again the two are not identical. Further, whatever\nthe future in fact brings, c might have been squeezed into a\nball and not destroyed. Since that is not true of \\(s_1\\), the two are\nnot identical. On a careful analysis, however, each of these arguments\ncan be seen to rely on NI or ND, provided one adopts the standard\naccount of modal/temporal predicates. This last proviso suggests\nan interesting way out for one who adheres to the standard account of\nidentity but who also holds that constitution is identity (see\nbelow).\n\nSome philosophers find it important or at least expedient to frame the\nissue in terms of the case of a statue \\(s\\) and piece of clay \\(c\\)\nthat coincide throughout their entire existence. We bring both \\(c\\)\nand \\(s\\) into existence by joining two other pieces of clay together,\nor we do something else that guarantees total coincidence. It seems\nthat total coincidence is supposed to lend plausibility to the claim\nthat, in such a case at least, constitution is identity (and hence NI\nis false\u2014Gibbard 1975). It may do so, psychologically, but not\nlogically. The same sorts of arguments as against the thesis that\nconstitution is identity apply in such a case. For example, \\(s\\) may\nbe admired for its aesthetic traits, even long after it ceases to\nexist, but this need not be true of \\(c\\). And \\(s\\) has the property,\nwhich \\(c\\) lacks, of being destroyed if squeezed into a ball. Those\nwho defend the thesis that constitution is identity need to defend it\nin the general case of partial coincidence; and those who attack the\nthesis do so with arguments that work equal well against both total\nand partial coincidence. The assumption that \\(s\\) and \\(c\\) are\ntotally coincident is therefore inessential.\n\nThe doctrine of temporal parts offers only limited help. The statement\nthat \\(c\\) is identical to \\(s_1\\) on day 1 but identical to \\(s_2\\)\non day 2 can be construed to mean that \\(c\\) is a temporally extended\nobject whose day 1 stage is identical to \\(s_1\\) and whose day 2 stage\nis identical to \\(s_2\\). Since the two stages are not identical, NI\ndoes not apply. Similarly, we can regard \\(s_2\\) as a temporally\nextended object that overlaps \\(c\\) on day 2 and \\(c'\\) on day 3. But\nunless temporal parts theorists are prepared to defend a doctrine of\nmodally extended objects\u2014objects extended through possible\nworlds analogous to objects extended in time\u2014there remains a\nproblem. \\(s_2\\) might have been made of a different piece of\nclay, as is in fact the case on day 3. That is, it is logically\npossible for \\(s_2\\) to fail to coincide with the day 2 stage of\n\\(c\\). But it is not logically possible for the day 2 stage of \\(c\\)\nto fail to coincide with itself.\n\nLewis recognizes this difficulty and proposes to deal with it by\nappealing to his counterpart theory (Lewis 1971, 1986, and 1993).\nDifferent concepts, e.g., statue and piece of clay,\nare associated with different counterpart relations and hence with\ndifferent criteria of trans-world identity. This has the effect of\nrendering modal predicates \u201cAbelardian\u201d (Noonan 1991,\n1993). The property determined by a modal predicate may be affected by\nthe subject term of a sentence containing the predicate. The subject\nterm denotes an object belonging to this or that kind or sort. But\ndifferent kinds or sorts may determine different properties (or\ndifferent counterpart relations). In particular, the properties\ndetermined by the predicate \u201cmight not have coincided with\n\\(c_2\\)\u201d (where \\(c_2\\) names the day 2 stage of \\(c)\\) in the\nfollowing sentences,\n\n\\(s_2\\) might not have coincided with \\(c_2\\),\n\\(c_2\\) might not have coincided with \\(c_2\\),\n\n\nare different, and hence (a) and (b) are compatible, even\nassuming that \\(s_2\\) and \\(c_2\\) are identical. (It should be\nemphasized that counterpart theory is not the only means of obtaining\nAbelardian predicates. See Noonan 1991.)\n\nThe upshot seems to be that the advocate of the standard account of\nidentity must maintain either that constitution is not identity or\nthat modal predicates are Abelardian. The latter option may be the\nfruitful one, since for one thing it seems to have applications that\ngo beyond the issue of constitution.\n2.5 The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n\nImagine a wooden ship restored by replacing all its planks and beams\n(and other parts) by new ones. Plutarch reports that such a ship\nwas\n\n\n\u2026 a model for the philosophers with respect to the disputed\narguments \u2026 some of them saying it remained the same, some of\nthem saying it did not remain the same. (Plutarch, Life of\nTheseus, 23; translated by Michael Rea in Rea 1995, p. 531).\n\n\nHobbes added the catch that the old parts are reassembled to create\nanother ship exactly like the original. Both the restored ship and the\nreassembled one appear to qualify equally to be the original. In the\none case, the original is \u201cremodeled\u201d, in the other, it is\nreassembled. Yet the two resulting ships are clearly not the same\nship.\n\nSome have proposed that in a case like this our ordinary\n\u201ccriteria of identity\u201d fail us. The process of dismantling\nand reassembling usually preserves identity, as does the process of\npart replacement (otherwise no soldier could be issued just one rifle\nand body shops would function as manufacturers). But in this case the\ntwo processes produce conflicting results: We get two ships, one of\nwhich is the same ship as the original, by one set of criteria, and\nthe other is the original ship, by another set of criteria. There is a\nsimilar conflict of criteria in the case of personal identity: Brain\nduplication scenarios (Wiggins 1967, Parfit 1984) suggest that it is\nlogically possible for one person to split into two competitors, each\nwith equal claim to be the original person. We take it for granted\nthat brain duplication will preserve the psychological properties\nnormally relevant to reidentifying persons and we also take it for\ngranted that the original brain continues to embody these properties\neven after it is duplicated. In this sense there is a conflict of\ncriteria. Such a case of \u201cfission\u201d gives us two distinct\nembodiments of these properties.\n\nPerhaps we should conclude that identity is not what matters. Instead,\nwhat matters is some other relation, but one that accounts as\nreadily as identity for such facts as that the owner of the original\nship would be entitled to both the restored version and the\nreassembled one. For the case of personal identity, Parfit (1984)\ndevelops such a response in detail. A related reaction would be to\nclaim that if both competitors have equal claim to be the original,\nthen neither is the original. If, however, one competitor is\ninferior, then the other wins the day and counts as the original. It\nseems that on this view certain contingencies can establish or falsify\nidentity claims. That conflicts with NI. Suppose that \\(w\\) is a\npossible world in which no ship is assembled from the discarded parts\nof the remodeled ship. In this world, then, the remodeled ship is the\noriginal. By NI, the restored ship and the original are identical in\nthe actual world, contrary to the claim of the \u201cbest\ncandidate\u201d doctrine (which says that neither the remodeled nor\nthe reassembled ship is the original). There are, however, more\nsophisticated \u201cbest candidate\u201d theories that are not\nvulnerable to this objection (Nozick 1982).\n\nSome are convinced that the remodeled ship has the best claim to be\nthe original, since it exhibits a greater degree of spatio-temporal\ncontinuity with the original (Wiggins 1967). But it is unclear why the\nintuition that identity is preserved by spatio-temporal continuity\nshould take precedence over the intuition that identity is preserved\nin the process of dismantlement and reassembly. Furthermore, certain\nversions of the ship of Theseus problem do not involve the feature\nthat one of the ships competing to be the original possesses a greater\ndegree of spatio-temporal continuity with the original than does the\nother (see below). Others are equally convinced that identity is\nnot preserved by total part replacement. This view is often\nsuggested blindly, as a stab in the dark, but there is in fact an\ninteresting argument in its favor. Kripke (1980) argues that a table\nmade out of a particular hunk of wood could not have been\nmade out of a (totally) different hunk of wood. His reasoning is this:\nSuppose that in the actual world a table \\(T\\) is made out of a hunk\nof wood \\(H\\); and suppose that there is a possible world \\(w\\) in\nwhich this very table, \\(T\\), is made out of a different hunk of wood,\n\\(H'\\). Then assuming that \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) are completely unrelated\n(for example, they do not overlap), so that making a table out of the\none is not somehow dependent upon making a table out of the other,\nthere is another possible world \\(w'\\) in which \\(T\\), as in the\nactual world, is made out of \\(H\\), and another table \\(T'\\), exactly\nsimilar to \\(T\\), is made out of \\(H'\\). Since \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) are\nnot identical in \\(w'\\), it follows by ND that the table made out of\n\\(H'\\) in \\(w\\) is not \\(T\\). Note, however, that the argument assumes\nthat the table made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w'\\) is the same table as the\ntable made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w\\).\n\nKripke\u2019s reasoning can be applied to the present case (Kripke\nand others might dispute this claim; see below). Let \\(w\\) be a\npossible world just like the actual world in that \\(O\\), the original\nship, is manufactured exactly as it is in the actual world. In \\(w\\),\nhowever, another ship, \\(S'\\), exactly similar to \\(O\\), is\nsimultaneously built out of precisely the same parts that \\(S\\), the\nremodeled ship, is built out of in the actual world. Since \\(S'\\) and\n\\(O\\) are clearly different ships in \\(w\\), it follows by ND that\n\\(O\\) and \\(S\\) are not the same ship in the actual world. Note again\nthat the argument assumes that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are the same ship, but\nit seems quite a stretch to deny that. Nevertheless, some have done\nso. Carter (1987) claims (in effect) that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are not\nidentical, but his argument simply assumes that \\(O\\) and\n\\(S\\) are the same ship. Alternatively, one might view the (Kripkean)\nargument as showing only that while \\(S\\) is the same ship as \\(O\\) in\nthe actual world, \\(S\\) (that is, \\(S')\\) is not the same ship as\n\\(O\\) in \\(w\\). But this is not an option for one who adheres to the\nstandard account and hence adheres to ND. In defending this view,\nhowever, Gallois (1986, 1988) suggests a weakened notion of rigid\ndesignation and a corresponding weakened formulation of ND. (See\nCarter 1987 for criticism of Gallois\u2019 proposals. See also\nChandler 1975 for a precursor of Gallois\u2019 argument.)\n\nIf we grant that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship, we seem to\nhave a solution to the ship of Theseus paradox. By the Kripkean\nargument, only the reassembled ship has any claim to being the\noriginal ship, \\(O\\). But this success is short-lived. For we are left\nwith the following additional paradox: Suppose that \\(S\\) eventuates\nfrom \\(O\\) by replacing one part of \\(O\\) one day at a time. There\nseems to be widespread agreement that replacing just one part of a\nthing by a new exactly similar part preserves the identity of the\nthing. If so, then, by the transitivity of identity, \\(O\\) and \\(S\\)\nmust be the same ship. It follows that either the Kripkean argument is\nincorrect, or replacement of even a single part (or small portion)\ndoes not preserve identity (a view known as \u201cmereological\nessentialism\u201d; Chisholm 1973).\n\nAs indicated, Kripke denies that his argument (for the necessity of\norigin) applies to the case of change over time: \u201cThe question\nwhether the table could have changed into ice is irrelevant\nhere\u201d (Kripke 1972, p. 351). So the question whether \\(O\\) could\nchange into \\(S\\) is supposedly \u201cirrelevant\u201d. But Kripke\ndoes not give a reason for this claim, and if cases of trans-temporal\nidentity and trans-world identity differ markedly in relevant\nrespects\u2014respects relevant to Kripke\u2019s argument for the\nnecessity of origin\u2014it is not obvious what they are. (But see\nForbes 1985, and Lewis 1986, for discussion.) The argument above was\nsimply that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship since there is a\npossible world in which they differ. If this argument is incorrect it\nis no doubt because there are conclusive reasons showing that \\(S\\)\nand \\(S'\\) differ. Even so, such reasons are clearly not\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d. One may suspect that, if applied to the\ntrans-temporal case, Kripke\u2019s reasoning will yield an argument\nfor mereological essentialism. Indeed, a trans-world counterpart of\nsuch an argument has been tried (Chandler 1976, though Chandler views\nhis argument somewhat differently). In its effect, this argument does\nnot differ essentially from the \u201cparadox\u201d sketched in the\nprevious paragraph (which may well be viewed as an argument for\nmereological essentialism). Subsequent commentators, e.g., Salmon\n(1979) and Chandler (1975, 1976), do not seem to take Kripke\u2019s\nadmonition of irrelevance seriously.\n\nIn any case, there \\(is\\) a close connection between the two issues\n(the ship of Theseus problem and the question of the necessity of\norigin). This can be seen (though it may already be clear) by\nconsidering a modified version of the ship of Theseus problem. Suppose\nthat when \\(O\\) is built, another ship \\(O'\\), exactly like \\(O\\), is\nalso built. Suppose that \\(O'\\) never sets sail, but instead is used\nas a kind of graphic repair manual and parts repository for \\(O\\).\nOver time, planks are removed from \\(O'\\) and used to replace\ncorresponding planks of \\(O\\). The result is a ship \\(S\\) made wholly\nof planks from \\(O'\\) and standing (in the end), we may suppose, in\nexactly the place \\(O'\\) has always stood. Now do \\(O\\) and \\(O'\\)\nhave equal claim to be \\(S\\)? And can we then declare that neither is\n\\(S\\)? Not according to the Kripkean line of thought. It looks for all\nthe world as though the process of \u201cremodeling\u201d \\(O\\) is\nreally just an elaborate means of dismantling and reassembling \\(O'\\).\nAnd if \\(O'\\) and \\(S\\) are the same ship, then since \\(O\\) and \\(O'\\)\nare distinct, \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship.\n\nThis argument is vulnerable to the following two important criticisms:\nFirst, it conflicts with the common sense principle that (1) the\nmaterial of an object can be totally replenished or replaced without\naffecting its identity (Salmon 1979); and secondly, as mentioned, it\nconflicts with the additional common sense principle that (2)\nreplacement by a single part or small portion preserves identity.\nThese objections may seem to provide sufficient grounds for rejecting\nthe Kripkean argument and perhaps restricting the application of\nKripke\u2019s original argument for the necessity of origin (Noonan\n1983). There is, however, a rather striking problem with (2), and it\nis unclear whether the conflict between (1) and the Kripkean argument\nshould be resolved in favor of the former.\n\nThe problem with (2) is this. Pick a simple sort of objects, say,\nshoes, or better, sandals. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two exactly\nsimilar sandals, one of which \\((A)\\) is brand new and the other\n\\((B)\\) is worn out. Each consists of a top strap and a sole, nothing\nmore. If \\(B\\)\u2019s worn strap is replaced by \\(A\\)\u2019s new\none, (2) dictates that the resulting sandal is \\(B\\)\n\u201crefurbished\u201d. In fact, if the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare simply exchanged, (2) dictates that the sandal with the new parts,\n\\(A'\\), is \\(B\\) and the sandal with the old parts, \\(B'\\), is \\(A\\).\nIt follows by ND that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) and \\(B\\) and \\(B'\\) are\ndistinct. This is surely the wrong result. The intuition that \\(A\\)\nand \\(A'\\) are the same sandal is very strong; and the process of\nexchanging the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) seems to amount to nothing\nmore than the dismantling and reassembling of each. This example is no\ndifferent in principle than the more elaborate trans-world cases\ndiscussed by Chisholm (1967), Chandler (1976), Salmon (1979), or Gupta\n(1980). (One who claims that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) differ in that \\(A'\\)\ncomes into existence after \\(A\\), does not have much to go on. \\(A\\)\ncannot be supposed to persist after \\(A'\\) comes into existence. We do\nnot end up with two new sandals and one old one. Why then\ncouldn\u2019t it be \\(A\\) itself that reappears at the later\ntime?)\n2.6 Church\u2019s Paradox\n\nThe following paradox\u2014perhaps the ultimate paradox of\nidentity\u2014derives from an argument of Church (1982). Suppose\nPierre thinks that London and Londres are different cities, but of\ncourse doesn\u2019t think that London is different from London, or\nthat Londres is different from Londres. Assuming that proper names\nlack Fregean senses, we can apply LL to get the result that London and\nLondres are distinct. We have here an argument that, given\nthe standard account of identity, merely thinking that \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are distinct is enough to make them so. There are, of\ncourse, a number of ways around this conclusion without abandoning the\nstandard account of identity. Church himself saw the argument (his\nversion of it) as demonstrating the inadequacy of Russellian\nintensional logic\u2014in which variables and constants operate as\nthey do in extensional logic, i.e., unequipped with senses. (For\nanother reaction, see Salmon 1986.) But there are strong arguments\nagainst the view that names (or variables) have senses (Kripke 1980).\nIn light of these arguments, Church\u2019s argument may be viewed as\nposing yet another paradox of identity.\n\nThe general form of Church\u2019s argument has been exploited by\nothers to reach further puzzling conclusions. For example, it has been\nused to show that there can be no such thing as vague or\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d identity (Evans 1978; and for discussion,\nParsons 2000). For \\(x\\) is not vaguely identical to \\(x\\); hence, if\n\\(x\\) is assumed to be vaguely identical to \\(y\\), then by LL, \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are (absolutely) distinct. As it stands, Evans\u2019\nargument shows at best that vaguely identical objects must be\nabsolutely distinct, not that there is no such thing as vague\nidentity. But some have tried to amend the argument to get\nEvans\u2019 conclusion (Parsons 2000; and see the entry on\nvagueness). In any case, it is useful to see the connection between\nEvans\u2019 argument and Church\u2019s. If, for example,\n\u201cvaguely identical\u201d is taken to mean \u201cthought to be\nidentical\u201d, then the two arguments collapse into one another.\nChurch\u2019s line of argument would seem to lead ultimately to the\nextreme antirealist position that any perceived difference among\nobjects is a real difference. If one resolves not to attempt to escape\nthe clutches of LL by some clever dodge\u2014by disallowing\nstraightforward quantifying-in, for example, as with the doctrine of\nAbelardian predicates\u2014one comes quickly to the absurd conclusion\nthat no statement of the form \\(x = y\\), where the terms are\ndifferent, or are just different tokens of the same type, can be true.\nYet it might just be that the fault lies not in ourselves, but in\nLL.\n2.7 The Theological Paradox\n\nThe Christian doctrine of Trinity is sometimes construed as a paradox\nthat involves incongruent identity statements. For example, the\nAthanasian Creed puts it like this: \u201c[\u2026] we worship one\nGod in Trinity. [\u2026] the Father is God; the Son is God; and the\nHoly Spirit is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one\nGod\u201d. One may conceptually unbundle these statements into the\nthe following set of claims:\n\nThe Father is a God.\nThe Son is a God.\nThe Holy Spirit is a God.\nThe Father is not identical with the Son.\nThe Father is not identical with the Holy Spirit.\nThe Son is not identical with the Holy Spirit.\nThere is at most one God, i.e., if \\(x\\) is a God and \\(y\\) is a\nGod, then \\(x\\) is identical with \\(y\\).\n\n\nIt is easy to see that this set is logically inconsistent and\nconsequently one may claim that the doctrine itself is conceptually\nincongruent.\n3. Relative Identity\n\nThe fundamental claim of relative identity\u2014the claim the various\nversions of the idea have in common\u2014is that, as it seems in the\npassenger/person case, it can and does happen that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nthe same \\(F\\) and (yet) \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same \\(G\\). Now\nit is usually supposed that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\n(\\(G\\) etc.), then that implies that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(F\\)s\n\\((G\\)s, etc.) If so, then the above schema is trivially satisfied by\nthe case in which \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same person but \\(x\\)\n(\\(y\\)) is not a passenger at all. But let us resolve to use the\nphrase \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different \\(G\\)s\u201d to mean\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are \\(G\\)s and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not the same\n\\(G\\)\u201d. Then the nontrivial core claim about relative identity\nis that the following may well be true:\n\n(RI)\n \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\) but \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\ndifferent \\(G\\)s. \n\n\nRI is a very interesting thesis. It seems to yield dramatically simple\nsolutions to (at least some of) the puzzles about identity. We appear\nto be in a position to assert that young Oscar and old Oscar are the\nsame dog but nonetheless distinct \u201ctemporary\u201d objects;\nthat Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are the same dog but different\ndog parts; that the same piece of clay can be now (identical to) one\nstatue and now another; that London and Londres are the same city but\ndifferent \u201cobjects of thought\u201d, and so forth. Doubts\ndevelop quickly, however. Either the same dog relation\nsatisfies LL or it does not. If it does not, it is unclear why it\nshould be taken to be a relation of identity. But if it\nsatisfies LL, then it follows, given that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are different dog parts, that\nOscar\u2212 is not the same dog part as\nOscar\u2212. Furthermore, assuming that the same dog\npart relation is reflexive, it follows from the\nassumption that Oscar\u2212 and Oscar\u2212\nare the same dog (and that LL is in force), that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are indeed the same dog part, which in fact\nthey are not.\n\nIt may seem, then, that RI is simply incoherent. These arguments,\nhowever, are a bit too quick. On analysis, they show only that the\nfollowing three conditions form an inconsistent triad: \n\n RI is true (for some fixed predicates \\(F\\) and \\(G)\\). \n Identity relations are equivalence relations. \n The relation x and y are the same F figuring in (1)\nsatisfies LL.\n\n\nFor suppose that the relation x and y are the same G,\nfiguring in (1), is reflexive and that \\(x\\) is a \\(G\\). Then \\(x\\) is\nthe same \\(G\\) as \\(x\\). But according to (1), \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are not\nthe same \\(G\\)s; hence, according to (3), it is not the case that\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\); yet (1) asserts otherwise. Now,\nmost relative identity theorists maintain that while identity\nrelations are equivalence relations, they do not in general satisfy\nLL. However, according to at least one analysis of the\npassenger/person case (and others), the same person relation\nsatisfies LL but the same passenger relation is not\nstraightforwardly an equivalence relation (Gupta 1980). It should be\nclear though that this view is incompatible with the principle of the\nidentity of indiscernibles: If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are different\npassengers, there must be, by the latter principle, some property\n\\(x\\) possesses that \\(y\\) does not. Hence if the same person\nrelation satisfies LL, it follows that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nnot the same person. For the remainder we will assume that\nidentity relations are equivalence relations. Given this assumption\n(and assuming that the underlying propositional logic is\nclassical\u2014cf. Parsons 2000), RI and LL are incompatible in the\nsense that within the framework of a single fixed language for which\nLL is defined, RI and LL are incompatible.\n\nYet the advocate of relative identity cannot simply reject any form of\nLL. There are true and indispensable instances of LL: If \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same dog, then, surely, if \\(x\\) is a Dalmatian, so is\n\\(y\\). The problem is that of formulating and motivating\nrestricted forms of LL that are nonetheless strong enough to\nbear the burden of identity claims. There has been little systematic\nwork done in this direction, crucial though it is to the relative\nidentity project. (See Deutsch 1997 for discussion of this issue.)\nThere are, however, equivalence relations that do satisfy restricted\nforms of LL. These are sometimes called \u201ccongruence\nrelations\u201d and they turn up frequently in mathematics. For\nexample, say that integers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are congruent if their\ndifference \\(n - m\\) is a multiple of 3. This relation preserves\nmultiplication and addition, but not every property. The numbers 2 and\n11 are thus congruent but 2 is even and 11 is not. There are also\nnon-mathematical congruencies. For example, the relation x and y\nare traveling at the same speed preserves certain properties and\nnot others. If objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are traveling at the same speed\nand \\(x\\) is traveling faster than \\(z\\), the same is true of \\(y\\).\nSuch similarity relations satisfy restricted forms of LL. In fact, any\nequivalence relation satisfies a certain minimal form of LL (see\nbelow).\n\nThere are strong and weak versions of RI. The weak version says that\nRI has some (in fact, many) true instances but also that there are\npredicates \\(F\\) such that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\),\nthen, for any equivalence relation, \\(E\\), whatsoever (whether or not\nan identity relation), \\(E(x,y)\\). This last condition implies that\nthe relation x and y are the same F satisfies LL. The\nrelation \\(P\\) defined so that \\(P(x,y)\\) if and only if \\(H(x)\\) and\n\\(H(y)\\), where \\(H\\) is some predicate, is an equivalence relation.\nHence, if \\(H\\) holds of \\(x\\) but not of \\(y\\), there is an\nequivalence relation (namely, \\(P(x,y))\\) that fails to hold of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\). If we add that in this instance \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nthe same \\(F\\)\u201d is to be interpreted in terms of the relation\n\\(I(A,x,y)\\), then the weak version of RI says that there is such a\nthing as relative identity and such a thing as absolute identity as\nwell. The strong version, by contrast, says that there are (many) true\ninstances of RI but there is no such thing as absolute identity. It is\ndifficult to know what to make of the latter claim. Taken literally,\nit is false. The notion of unrestricted identity (in the sense of\n\u201cunrestricted\u201d explained in \u00a71) is demonstrably\ncoherent. We return to this matter in \u00a75.\n\nThe puzzles about identity outlined in \u00a72 (and there are many\nothers, as well as many variants of these) put considerable pressure\non the standard account. A theory of identity that allows for\ninstances of RI is an attractive alternative (see below \u00a74). But\nthere is a certain kind of example of RI, frequently discussed in the\nliterature, that has given relative identity something of a bad name.\nThe passenger/person example is a case in point. The noun\n\u201cpassenger\u201d is derived from the corresponding relational\nexpression \u201cpassenger in (on) \u2026\u201d. A passenger is\nsomeone who is a passenger in some vehicle (on some flight, etc.).\nSimilarly, a father is a man who fathers someone or who is the father\nof someone. This way of defining a kind of things from a relation\nbetween things is perfectly legitimate and altogether open-ended.\nGiven any relation \\(R\\), we can define \u201can \\(R\\)\u201d to\napply to anything \\(x\\) that stands in \\(R\\) to something \\(y\\). For\nexample, we can define a \u201cschmapple\u201d to be an apple in a\nbarrel. All this is fine. But we can\u2019t infer from such\na definition that the same apple might be two different schmapples.\nFrom the fact that someone is the father of two different children, we\ndon\u2019t judge that he is two different fathers. The fact that\nairlines choose to count passengers as they do, rather than track\npersons, is their business, not logic\u2019s.\n\nHowever, when \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation, we are entitled to\nsuch an inference. Consider the notorious case of \u201csurmen\u201d\n(Geach 1967). A pair of men are the \u201csame surman\u201d if they\nhave the same surname; and a surman is a man who bears this relation\nto someone. So now it appears that two different men can be the same\nsurman, since two different men can have the same surname. As Geach\n(1967) insists (also Geach 1973), surmen are defined to be\nmen, so they are not merely classes of men. Hence we seem to have an\ninstance of RI, and obviously any similarity relation (e.g., \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) have the same shape) will give rise to a similar case. Yet such\ninstances of RI are not very interesting. It is granted all around\nthat when \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d is adjectival,\ndifferent \\(G\\)s may be the same \\(F\\). Different men may have the\nsame surname, different objects the same color, etc. Turning an\nadjectival similarity relation into a substantival one having the form\nof an identity statement yields an identity statement in name\nonly.\n\nA word about the point of view of those who subscribe to the weak\nversion of RI. The view (call it the \u201cweak view\u201d) is that\nordinary identity relations concerning (largely) the world of\ncontingency and change are equivalence relations answering to\nrestricted forms of LL. The exact nature of the restriction depends on\nthe equivalence relation itself, though there is an element of\ngenerality. The kinds of properties preserved by the same dog\nrelation are intuitively the same kinds of properties as are\npreserved by the same cat relation. From a logical point of\nview the best that can be said is that any identity relation, like any\nequivalence relation, preserves a certain minimal set of properties.\nFor suppose \\(E\\) is some equivalence relation. Let \\(S\\) be the set\ncontaining all formulas of the form \\(E(x,y)\\), and closed under the\nformation of negations, conjunctions, and quantification. Then \\(E\\)\npreserves any property expressed by a formula in \\(S\\). Furthermore,\non this view, although absolutely distinct objects may be the same\n\\(F\\), absolutely identical objects cannot differ at all. Any instance\nof RI implies that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct.\n4. The Paradoxes Reconsidered\n\nLet us look back at the paradoxes of identity outlined in \u00a72 from\nthe perspective of the weak view regarding relative identity. That\nview allows that absolutely distinct objects may be the same \\(F\\),\nbut denies that absolutely identical objects can be different\n\\(G\\)\u2019s. This implies that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are relatively\ndifferent objects, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct, and\nhence only pairs of absolutely distinct objects can satisfy RI. If\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely distinct, we shall say that \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are distinct \u201clogical objects\u201d; and similarly, if\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are absolutely identical objects, then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare identical logical objects. The term \u201clogical object\u201d\ndoes not stand for some new and special kind of thing. Absolutely\ndistinct apples, for example, are distinct logical objects.\n\nThe following is the barest sketch of relativist solutions to the\nparadoxes of identity discussed in \u00a72. No attempt is made to\nfully justify any proposed solution, though a modicum of justification\nemerges in the course of \u00a76. It should be kept in mind that some\nof the strength of the relativist solutions derives from the\nweaknesses of the absolutist alternatives, some of which are discussed\nin \u00a72.\n4.1 The Paradox of Change\n\nYoung Oscar and old Oscar are the same dog but absolutely different\nthings, i.e., different logical objects. The material conditions\nrendering young Oscar and old Oscar the same dog (and the same\nDalmatian) are precisely the same as the material conditions under\nwhich young Oscar and old Oscar would qualify as temporal parts of the\nsame dog. The only difference is logical. The identity\nrelation between young Oscar and old Oscar can be formalized in an\nextensional logic (Deutsch 1997), but a theory of temporal parts\nrequires a modal/temporal apparatus. Young Oscar is wholly present\nduring his youth and possesses the simple, non-relational, property of\nnot having a gray muzzle.\n4.2 Chrysippus\u2019 Paradox\n\nOscar and Oscar\u2212 both survive Oscar\u2019s loss of a\ntail. At both \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are\nthe same dog, but at \\(t\\), Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are\ndistinct logical objects. This implies (by ND) that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are distinct logical objects even at \\(t'\\)\nHence, we must allow that distinct logical objects may occupy the same\nspace at the same time. This is not a problem, however. For although\nOscar and Oscar\u2212 are distinct logical objects at\n\\(t'\\), they are physically coincident.\n4.3 The Paradox of 101 Dalmatians\n\nThe relativist denies that dogs are \u201cmaximal\u201d. It is not\ntrue that no proper part of a dog is dog. All the 101 (and more)\nproper parts of Oscar differing from him and from one another by a\nhair are dogs. In fact, many (though of course not all) identity\npreserving changes Oscar might undergo correspond directly to proper\nparts of (an unchanged) Oscar. But there is no problem about barking\nin unison, and no problem about acting independently. All 101 are the\nsame dog, despite their differences, just as young Oscar and old Oscar\nare the same dog. The relativist denies that the dogs are many rather\nthan deny that the many are dogs (Lewis 1993).\n4.4 The Paradox of Constitution\n\nConstitution is identity, absolute identity. The relation\nbetween the piece of clay \\(c\\) and the statue \\(s_1\\) on day 1 is one\nof absolute identity. So we have that \\(c = s_1\\) on day 1, and for\nthe same reason, \\(c = s_2\\) on day 2. Furthermore, since \\(s_1\\) and\n\\(s_2\\) are different statues, it follows (on the weak view) that\n\\(s_1\\ne s_2\\). In addition, the piece of clay \\(c\\) constituting\n\\(s_1\\) on day 1 is (relatively) the same piece of clay as the piece\nof clay constituting \\(s_2\\) on day 2. (The identity is relative\nbecause we have distinct objects\u2014the two statues\u2014that are\nthe same piece of clay.) It follows that no name of the piece of\nclay c can be a rigid designator in the standard sense. That is,\nno name of \\(c\\) denotes absolutely the same thing on day 1 and on day\n2. For on day 1, a name of the piece of clay \\(c\\) would denote\n\\(s_1\\) and on day 2, it would denote \\(s_2\\), and \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\)\nare absolutely distinct. Nevertheless, a name of the piece of clay may\nbe relatively rigid: it may denote at each time the same\npiece of clay. Although no name of the piece of clay \\(c\\) is\nabsolutely rigid, that does not prevent the introduction of a name of\n\\(c\\) that denotes \\(c\\) at any time (or possible world). (Kraut 1980\ndiscusses a related notion of relative rigidity.)\n\nThere is, however, a certain ambiguity in the notion of a name of the\npiece of clay, inasmuch as the piece of clay may be any number of\nabsolutely distinct objects. The notion of relative rigidity\npresupposes that a name for the piece of clay refers, with respect to\nsome parameter \\(p\\), to whatever object counts as the piece of clay\nrelative to that parameter. This may be sufficient in the case of the\npiece of clay, but in other cases it is not. With respect to a fixed\nparameter \\(p\\) there may be no unique object to serve as the referent\nof the name. For example, if any number of dog parts count, at a fixed\ntime, as the same dog, then which of these objects serves as the\nreferent of \u201cOscar\u201d? We shall leave this question open for\nthe time being but suggest that it may be worthwhile to view names\nsuch as \u201cOscar\u201d as instantial terms\u2014terms\nintroduced into discourse by means of existential instantiation. The\nname \u201cOscar\u201d might be taken as denoting a representative\nmember of the equivalence class of distinct objects qualifying as the\nsame dog as Oscar. It would follow, then, that most ordinary names are\ninstantial terms. (An alternative is that of Geach 1980, who draws a\ndistinction between a name of and a name for an\nobject; see Noonan 1997 for discussion of Geach\u2019s\ndistinction.)\n4.5 The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n\nIn this case, the relativist, as so far understood, may seem to enjoy\nno advantage over the absolutist. The problem is not clearly one of\nreconciling LL with ordinary judgments of identity, and the advantage\nafforded by RI does not seem applicable. Griffin (1977), for example,\nrelying on RI, claims that the original and remodeled ship are the\nsame ship but not the same collection of planks, whereas the\nreassembled ship is the same collection of planks as the original but\nnot the same ship. This simply doesn\u2019t resolve the problem. The\nproblem is that the reassembled and remodeled ships have, prima\nfacie, equal claim to be the original and so the bald claims that\nthe reassembled ship is not\u2014and the remodeled ship is\u2014the\noriginal are unsupported. The problem is that of reconciling the\nintuition that certain small changes (replacement of a single part or\nsmall portion) preserve identity, with the problem illustrated by the\nsandals example of \u00a72.5. It turns out, nevertheless, that the\nproblem \\(is\\) one of dealing with the excesses of LL. To resolve the\nproblem, we need an additional level of relativity. To motivate this\ndevelopment, consider the following abstract counterpart of the\nsandals example:\n\nOn the left there is an object \\(P\\) composed of three parts, \\(P_1,\nP_2\\), and \\(P_3\\). On the right is an exactly similar but\nnon-identical object, \\(Q\\), composed of exactly similar parts, \\(Q_1,\nQ_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\), in exactly the same arrangement. For the sake of\nillustration, we adopt the rule that only replacement of (at most) a\nsingle part by an exactly similar part preserves identity.\nSuppose we now interchange the parts of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). We begin by\nreplacing \\(P_1\\) by \\(Q_1\\) in \\(P\\) and replacing \\(Q_1\\) by \\(P_1\\)\nin \\(Q\\), to obtain objects \\(P^1\\) and \\(Q^1\\). So \\(P^1\\) is\ncomposed of parts \\(Q_1,\\) \\(P_2,\\) and \\(P_3\\), and Q\\(^1\\) is\ncomposed of parts \\(P_1,\\) \\(Q_2,\\) and \\(Q_3\\). We then replace\n\\(P_2\\) in \\(P^1\\) by \\(Q_2\\), to obtain \\(P^2\\), and so on. Given our\nsample criterion of identity, and assuming the transitivity of\nidentity, \\(P\\) and \\(P^3\\) are counted the same, as are \\(Q\\) and\n\\(Q^3\\). But this appears to be entirely the wrong result.\nIntuitively, \\(P\\) and \\(Q^3\\) are the same, as are \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\).\nFor \\(P\\) and \\(Q^3\\) are composed of exactly the same parts put\ntogether in exactly the same way, and similarly for \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\).\nFurthermore, \\(Q_3 (P_3)\\) can be viewed as simply the result of\ntaking \\(P (Q)\\) apart and putting it back together in a\nslightly different location. And this last difference can be\neliminated by switching the locations of \\(P^3\\) and \\(Q^3\\) as a last\nstep in the process.\n\nSuppose, however, that we replace our criterion of identity by the\nfollowing more complicated rule: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\nrelative to z, if both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) differ from \\(z\\) at\nmost by a single part. (This relation is transitive, and is in fact an\nequivalence relation.) For example, relative to \\(P\\), \\(P,\nP^1, Q^2\\), and \\(Q^3\\) are the same, but \\(Q, Q^1, P^2\\) and \\(P^3\\),\nare not. Of course, replacement by a single part is an artificial\ncriterion of identity. In actual cases, it will be a matter of the\ndegree or kind of deviation from the original (represented by\nthe third parameter, \\(z)\\). The basic idea is that identity through\nchange is not a matter of identity through successive, accumulated\nchanges\u2014that notion conflicts with both intuition (e.g., the\nsandals example) and the Kripkean argument: Through successive changes\nobjects can evolve into other objects. The three-place\nrelation of identity does not satisfy LL and is consistent with the\noutlook of the relativist. Gupta (1980) develops a somewhat similar\nidea in detail. Williamson (1990) suggests a rather different\napproach, but one that, like the above, treats identity through change\nas an equivalence relation that does not satisfy LL.\n4.6 Church\u2019s Paradox\n\nChurch\u2019s argument implies that if Pierre\u2019s doxastic\nposition is as described (in \u00a72.6), then London and Londres are\ndistinct objects. Assuming the standard account of identity, the\nresult is that either Pierre\u2019s doxastic position cannot\nbe as described or else London and Londres are different\ncities (or else we must punt). Since London and Londres are\nnot different cities, the standard account entails that Pierre\u2019s\ndoxastic position cannot be as described (or else we must punt). This\nwas Church\u2019s own position as regards certain puzzles about\nsynonymy, such as Mates\u2019 puzzle (Mates 1952). Church held that\none who believes that lawyers are lawyers, must indeed believe that\nlawyers are attorneys, despite any refusal to assent to (or desire to\ndissent from) \u201cLawyers are attorneys\u201d (Church 1954).\nKripke later argued (Kripke 1979) that assent and failure to assent\nmust be taken at face value (at least in the case of Pierre) and\nPierre\u2019s doxastic position is as described. Kripke chose to\npunt\u2014concluding that the problem is a problem for any\n\u201clogic\u201d of belief. The relativist concludes instead that\n(a) Pierre\u2019s doxastic position is as described, (b) if so,\nLondon and Londres are distinct objects, and (c) London and Londres\nare nonetheless the same city. Whether this resolution of\nChurch\u2019s paradox can be exploited to yield solutions to\nFrege\u2019s puzzle (Salmon 1986) or Kripke\u2019s puzzle (1979)\nremains to be seen. Crimmins (1998) has suggested that the analysis of\npropositional attitudes requires a notion of \u201csemantic\npretense\u201d. In reporting Pierre\u2019s doxastic position we\nengage in a pretense to the effect that London and Londres are\ndifferent cities associated with different Fregean senses.\nCrimmins\u2019 goal is to reconcile (a), (c) and the following, (d):\nthat the pure semantics of proper names (\u201cLondon\u201d,\n\u201cLondres\u201d) is Millian or directly referential (Kripke\n1979). The relativist proposes just such a reconciliation but suggests\nthat the pretense can be dropped.\n4.7 The Theological Paradox\n\nThe solution provided by RI is straightforward: we need to state the\ndoctrine not in terms of absolute identity, but in terms of relative\nidentity. So instead of one predicate of absolute identity the\ntrinitarian creed may need two predicates of relative identity, e.g.,\nbeing the same person and being the same being (cf. van Inwagen 1988,\n2003), or, as suggested by (Anscombe and Geach 1961), being the same\nperson and being the same God. Then we may reformulate the creed as\nfollows:\n\nThe Father is a God.\nThe Son is a God.\nThe Holy Spirit is a God.\nThe Father is not the same person as the Son.\nThe Father is not the same person as the Holy Spirit.\nThe Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit.\nThere is at most one God, i.e., if \\(x\\) is a God and \\(y\\) is a\nGod, then \\(x\\) is the same being as \\(y\\).\n\n\nVan Inwagen produced a model (in the sense of formal semantics) where\nall these statements are satisfied, so under this interpretation the\ndoctrine of Trinity comes out consistent. Incidentally let me note\nthat he also gave an analogous interpretation for the doctrine of\nIncarnation (see van Inwagen 1994). For an extended discussion of the\ncoherence of this solution see the section on relative identity\ntheories in the entry on\n Trinity.\n Note that Branson (2019) provides a taxonomy of all possible\nsolutions to the paradox, including the ones that resort to relative\nidentity.\n5. Absolute Identity\n\nThe philosopher P.T. Geach first broached the subject of relative\nidentity and introduced the phrase \u201crelative identity\u201d.\nOver the years, Geach suggested specific instances of RI (a variant of\nthe case of Oscar and his tail is due to Geach 1980) and in this way\nhe contributed to the development of the weak view concerning relative\nidentity, i.e., the view that while ordinary identity relations are\noften relative, some are not. But Geach maintains that absolute\nidentity does not exist. What is his argument?\n\nThat is hard to say. Geach sets up two strawman candidates for\nabsolute identity, one at the beginning of his discussion and one at\nthe end, and he easily disposes of both. In between he develops an\ninteresting and influential argument to the effect that identity,\neven as formalized in the system FOL=, is relative\nidentity. However, Geach takes himself to have shown, by this\nargument, that absolute identity does not exist. At the end of his\ninitial presentation of the argument in his 1967 paper, Geach\nremarks:\n\n\nWe thought we had a criterion for a predicable\u2019s expressing\nstrict identity [i.e., as Geach says, \u201cstrict, absolute,\nunqualified identity\u201d]; but the thing has come apart in our\nhands; and no alternative rigorous criterion that could replace this\none has thus far been suggested. (Geach 1967, p. 6 [1972, p. 241])\n\n\nIt turns out, as we\u2019ll see, that all that comes apart is the\nfalse notion that in FOL= the identity symbol\ndefines the relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\). Let us examine\nGeach\u2019s line of reasoning in detail, focusing on the\npresentation in his 1967 article, the locus classicus of the\nnotion of relative identity.\n\nGeach begins by urging that a plain identity statement \u201c\\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are the same\u201d is in need of a completing predicate:\n\u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d. Frege had argued\nthat statements of number such as \u201cthis is one\u201d require a\ncompleting predicate: \u201cthis is one \\(F\\)\u201d, and so it is,\nGeach claims, with identity statements. This is a natural view for one\nwho subscribes to RI. The latter cannot even be stated without the\ncompleting predicates. Nevertheless, both the claim itself and the\nanalogy with Frege have been questioned. Some argue that the analogy\nwith Frege is incorrect. For example, Carrara and Sacchi (2007)\nmaintain that Frege\u2019s position that any ascription of a number\nto something is always relative to a concept boils down to the claim\nthat concepts are essential in cardinality statements because without\nthem there is no specification of what is to be counted. Once this is\nsettled, Frege would count by means of absolute identity. Others\nargued that while the analogy is correct, both Frege and Geach are\nwrong (Perry 1978 and Alston and Bennett 1984). These matters do not\nbear directly on the question of the coherence and truth of RI or the\nquestion of absolute identity. One who adopts the weak view would not\nwant to follow Geach on this score. And one could maintain the\n\u201ccompleting thesis\u201d without being committed to RI.\nFurthermore, the completing thesis occupies a puzzling role in\nGeach\u2019s dialectic. Immediately following his statement of the\nthesis, Geach formalizes FOL= on the basis of the single\nformula:\n\n(R)\n \\(\\phi(a) \\leftrightarrow \\exists x(\\phi(x) \\wedge x = a)\\) \n\n\n(The \u201cW\u201d is for Hao Wang, who first suggested it. The\nreader is invited to prove Ref and LL from W.) But we hear no\ncomplaint about the syntax of W despite its involving a seemingly\nunrelativized identity symbol. It turns out, however, that Geach\napparently thinks of the completing predicate as being given by the\nwhole descriptive apparatus of \\(L\\) or a fragment thereof.\n\nGeach now observes\n\n\n\u2026 if we consider a moment, we see that an I-predicable in a\ngiven theory T need not express strict, absolute,\nunqualified identity; it need mean no more than that two objects are\nindiscernible by the predicables that form the descriptive resources\nof the theory\u2014the ideology of the theory \u2026.\n(1967, p. 5 [1972, p. 240])\n\n\nHere an \u201cI-predicable\u201d is a binary relation symbol\n\u201c=\u201d satisfying (W). Geach\u2019s focus at this point is\non the need to relativize an I-predicable to a theory \\(T\\). Geach\nthen immediately saddles the friend of absolute identity with the view\nthat for \u201creal identity\u201d we need not bring in the ideology\nof a definite theory. This is Geach\u2019s first strawman. When\nlogicians, in discussing FOL=, speak of \u201creal\nidentity\u201d\u2014and they often do (see Enderton 2000 or Silver\n1994, for example)\u2014they do not mean a relation of universal\nidentity, since the universal set does not exist. Nor do they\nintend, in formulating LL, to use \u201ctrue of\u201d in a\ncompletely unrestrained way which gives rise to semantic paradox. It\nis no argument against those who wish to distinguish mere\nindiscernibility from real identity to say that they \u201cwill soon\nfall into contradictions\u201d, e.g., Grelling\u2019s or\nRussell\u2019s. The relation \\(I(A,x,y)\\) is sufficiently\nrelativized. (It is relativized to a set A.)\n\nWe come next to the main point:\n\n\nObjects that are indiscernible when we are confined to the ideology of\n\\(T\\) may perfectly well be discernible in the ideology of a theory\n\\(T^1\\) of which \\(T\\) is a fragment. (Geach 1967, p. 5 [1972, p.\n240])\n\n\nThe warrant for this claim can only be the language relativity of\nidentity when treated as a non-logical notion (see \u00a71). That this\nis what Geach has in mind is clear from some approving remarks he\nmakes in his 1973 article about Quine\u2019s (1970) proposal to treat\nidentity as a non-logical notion. But how does it follow that absolute\nidentity does not exist? Geach seems to think that the defender of\nabsolute identity will look to Ref and LL (or W)\u2014and not\nbeyond\u2014for a full account of \u201cstrict, absolute,\nunqualified\u201d identity. That is not so. The fact that these\nformulas in themselves define only indiscernibility relations is a\nlogical commonplace. So this is Geach\u2019s second strawman.\n\nIs Geach\u2019s argument at least an argument that identity is\nrelative? Does language relativity support the conclusion that RI is\ntrue even of identity as formalized in FOL=? The general\nidea appears to be that language relativity suggests that we take\nidentity to be indiscernibility, and conclude that objects\nidentical relative to one ideology \\(F\\) may be different relative to\nanother ideology \\(G\\), and that this confirms RI. Notice first of all\nthat this argument relies on the identity of indiscernibles: that\nindiscernibility implies identity. This principle is not valid in\nFOL= even when the latter is treated as a proper theory.\nLanguage relativity does not imply that the distinctness of distinct\nobjects cannot go unnoticed.\n\nSecondly, the interesting cases of RI do not involve a shift from an\nimpoverished point of view to an improved one\u2014whether this is\nseen in epistemic terms (which Geach disputes\u2014Geach 1973) or in\npurely logical terms. We do not affirm that old Oscar and young Oscar,\nfor example, are the same dog on the grounds that there is an ideology\nwith respect to which old Oscar and young Oscar are indistinguishable.\nSuch an ideology would be incapable of describing any change in Oscar.\nIt is true that the same dog relation determines a set of\npredicates that do not discriminate between the members of certain\npairs of dogs\u2014the dogs in the photographs mentioned earlier, for\nexample. And it is true that these predicates determine a sublanguage\nin which the same dog relation is a congruence, i.e., no\npredicate of the sublanguage distinguishes \\(x\\) from \\(y\\), if \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are the same dog. But the very sense of such\nstatements as that old Oscar and young Oscar are the same dog requires\na language in which a change in Oscar is expressible. We are talking,\nafter all, about old Oscar and young Oscar. If we\ntake seriously the idea that change involves the application of\nincompatible predicates, then the sublanguage cannot express the\ncontrast between old Oscar and young Oscar.\n\nThird, the phenomenon of language relativity (in the technical sense\ndiscussed in \u00a71) has led many philosophers, including Geach, to\nthe view that ideology creates ontology. There is no antecedently\ngiven domain of objects, already individuated, and waiting to be\ndescribed. Instead, theories carve up the world in various ways,\nrendering some things noticeably distinct and others indiscernible,\ndepending on a theory\u2019s descriptive resources. The very notion\nof object is theory-bound (Kraut 1980). This sort of\nanti-realism may seem to go hand in hand with relative identity. Model\ntheory, however, is realist to its core and language relativity is a\nmodel-theoretic phenomenon. It is a matter of definability (in a\nstructure). Referring back to \u00a71, in order to make sense of\nlanguage relativity we have to start with a pair of distinct\nobjects, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (distinct from the standpoint of the\nmetalanguage), and hence a pair of objects we assume are already\nindividuated. These objects, however, are indistinguishable in \\(M\\),\nsince no formula of \\(L'\\) defines a subset of \\(M\\) containing the\none object and not the other. When we move to \\(M'\\), we find that\nthere is a formula of the enriched language that defines such a subset\nin \\(M'\\). Thus, language relativity is not really any sort of\nrelativity of identity at all. We must assume that the\nobjects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are distinct in order to describe the\nphenomenon. If we are living in \\(M\\), and suspect that Martians\nliving in \\(M'\\) can distinguish \\(a\\) from \\(b\\), our suspicion is\nnot merely to the effect that Martians carve things up differently\nthan we do. Our own model theory tells us that there is more to it\nthan that. Our suspicion must be to the effect that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nare absolutely distinct. If we are blind to the difference\nbetween \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the Martians are not, then there must be\na difference; and even if we are living in \\(M\\), we know\nthere\u2019s a difference, or at least we can suspect there is, since\nmodel theory tells us that such suspicion is well founded.\n\nLet us go back to Geach\u2019s remark that we \u201cneed\nnot\u201d interpret identity absolutely. While this is true, we\nneed not interpret it as indiscernibility either. There are always the\nquotient structures (Quine 1963). Instead of taking our\n\u201creality\u201d to be \\(M\\), and our \u201cidentity\u201d to\nbe indiscernibility in \\(M\\), we can move to the quotient structure,\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\), whose elements are the equivalence classes, \\([x]\\),\nfor \\(x\\) in \\(M\\). If \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are indiscernible in \\(M\\),\nthen in \\(\\textit{QM}\\), \\([x]\\) and [\\(y\\)] are absolutely identical.\nWe can do this even if we wish to treat FOL= as a proper\ntheory. For example, suppose \\(L'\\) is a language in which people\nhaving the same income are indiscernible. The domain of \\(M\\) now\nconsists of people. \\(\\textit{QM}\\), however, consists of income\ngroups, equivalence classes of people having the same income, and\nidentity in \\(\\textit{QM}\\) is absolute. Geach objects to such\nreinterpretation in terms of the quotient structures on the grounds\nthat it increases the ontological commitments not only of \\(L'\\) but\nof any language of which \\(L'\\) is a sublanguage.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on \\(L'\\) first. From a purely model-theoretic point\nof view the question is moot. We cannot deny that \\(\\textit{QM}\\) is a\nstructure for \\(L'\\). Thus, \\(L'\\) is committed to people vis\n\u00e0 vis one structure and to income groups vis \u00e0\nvis the corresponding quotient structure. But let\u2019s pretend\nthat the structures are \u201crepresentations of reality\u201d, and\nso the question now becomes: Which representation is preferable? Is\nthere then any reason to prefer the ontology of \\(M\\) to that of\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\)? \\(M\\) contains people but no sets of people, whereas\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\) contains sets of people but no people. By\nQuine\u2019s criterion of ontological commitment\u2014that to be is\nto be the value of a variable\u2014commitment to a set of objects\ndoes not carry a commitment to its elements. That is one of the odd\nconsequences of Quine\u2019s criterion. Unless there is some\nontological reason to prefer people to sets of people (perhaps because\nsets are never to be preferred), the ontologies of \\(M\\) and\n\\(\\textit{QM}\\) seem pretty much on a par. Both commit \\(L'\\) to one\nkind of thing.\n\nGeach makes the additional claim that the ontological commitments of a\nsublanguage \\(L'\\) of a language \\(L\\) are inherited by \\(L\\) (Geach\n1973). Suppose then that \\(L\\) is a language containing expressions\nfor several equivalence relations defined on people: say, same\nincome, same surname, and same job. Geach\nargues that \\(L\\) need only be committed to the existence of people.\nThings such as income groups, job groups (equivalence classes of\npeople with the same job), and surmen can all be counted using the\nequivalencies, without bringing surmen, job groups, and income groups\ninto the picture. Consider any sublanguage for which any one of these\nequivalence relations is a congruence, i.e., for which\n\\(\\textrm{LL}'\\) holds. Pick the language, \\(L_1\\), for example, in\nwhich people having the same job are indiscernible. More precisely, we\nassume that \\(T_1\\) is the pure theory with identity whose ideology is\nconfined to the language \\(L_1\\). Let \\(M_1\\) be a model of \\(T_1\\).\nWe may imagine the domain of \\(M_1\\) to consist of people, and we can\ninterpret indiscernibility in \\(M_1\\) to be the relation x and y\nhave the same job. Geach would argue that if \\(L_1\\) is committed\nto the elements of \\(\\textit{QM}_1\\)\u2014the job groups\u2014then\nso is \\(L\\). But that is not true. If \\(T\\) is a theory of the three\ndistinct equivalence relations formulated in \\(L\\), the most \\(T\\) (or\n\\(L)\\) would be committed to are the partitions determined by the\nequivalence relations; and in any case, it would be perfectly\nconsistent to insist that, whatever the ontological commitments of\n\\(L_1\\), reality, as described by \\(L\\), consists of people.\n\nThe foregoing considerations are rather abstract. To see more clearly\nwhat is at stake, let us focus on a specific example. Geach (1967)\nmentions that rational numbers are defined set-theoretically to be\nequivalence classes of integers determined by a certain equivalence\nrelation defined on \u201cfractions\u201d, i.e., ordered pairs of\nintegers (1/2 is \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle\\), 2/4 is \\(\\langle\n2,4\\rangle\\), etc.). He suggests that we can instead construe our\ntheory of rational numbers to be about the fractions themselves,\ntaking the I-predicable of our theory to be the following equivalence\nrelation, \\(E\\): \n\\[\\tag{R} E(\\langle x,y\\rangle, \\langle u,v\\rangle) \\text{ iff } xv = yu. \\]\n\n\nThis approach, Geach says, would have \u201cthe advantage of\nlightening a theory\u2019s set-theoretical burdens. (In our present\nexample, we need not bring in infinite sets of ordered pairs\nof integers into the theory of rationals.)\u201d (Geach 1972, p. 249)\n\n\nThe first thing to notice about this example is that E cannot\nbe the I-predicable of such a theory, since \\(E\\) is defined\nin terms of identity (look at the right side of R). It is\n\u201c=\u201d that must serve as the I-predicable, and it renders\ndistinct ordered pairs of integers discernible. The moral is that not\nall equivalence relations can be drafted to do the job of identity,\neven given a limited ideology. There is, indeed, a plausible argument\nthat any equivalence relation presupposes identity\u2014not\nnecessarily in the direct way illustrated by (R), but indirectly,\nnonetheless (see \u00a76). Moreover, from the standpoint of general\nmathematics, once we have (R), we have the (infinite) equivalence\nclasses it determines and the partition it induces. These are\ninescapable. Even from a more limited viewpoint, it seems that once we\nhave enough set theory to give us ordered pairs of integers and the\nability to define (R), we get the partition it induces as well.\n\nGeach perceives an ontological advantage in relative identity; but his\nargument is unconvincing. Shifting to the quotient structures, as\nQuine suggested, does not induce a \u201cbaroque, Meinongian\nontology\u201d (Geach 1967, p. 10 [1972, p. 245]). In particular, the\n\u201chome language\u201d \\((L)\\) does not inherit the commitment of\nthe fragment \\((L_1)\\), and the ontology of an arbitrary model of the\npure theory of identity based on the latter language is at least no\nmore various than that of the corresponding quotient model. There are,\nhowever, a number of ways in which relative identity does succeed in\navoiding commitment to certain entities required by its absolute\nrival. These are discussed in the replies to objections 4 and 5 in the\nnext section.\n6. Objections and Replies\n\nThe following constitute a \u201cstart-up\u201d set of objections\nand replies concerning relative identity and/or aspects of the\nforegoing account of relative identity and its rival. Time and space\nconstraints prevent a more extended initial discussion. In addition,\nthere is no presumption that the objections discussed below are the\nmost important or that the initial replies to them are without fault.\nIt is hoped that the present discussion will evolve into a more\nfull-blown one, involving contributions by the author and readers\nalike. Should the discussion become lengthy, old or unchallenged\nobjections and/or replies can be placed in the archives.\n\nObjection 1: \u201cRelativist theories of identity,\nall of which are inconsistent with Leibniz\u2019s principle [LL],\ncurrently enjoy little support. The doubts about them are (a) whether\nthey really are theories of numerical identity, (b) whether they can\nbe made internally consistent, and (c) whether they are sufficiently\nmotivated\u201d (Burke 1994, p. 133).\n\nReply: In reverse order: (c) The issues discussed in\n\u00a72 and \u00a74 surely provide sufficient motivation. (b) No proof\nof inconsistency has ever been forthcoming from opponents of relative\nidentity, and in fact the weak view is consistent inasmuch as it has a\nmodel in the theory of similarity relations. The arguments outlined in\nthe second paragraph of \u00a73 are frequently cited as showing that\nrelative identity is incoherent; but they show only that RI is\nincompatible with (unrestricted) LL. (a) See the replies to objections\n2 and 3 below.\n\nObjection 2: If an identity relation obeys only a\nrestricted form of LL\u2014if it preserves only some\nproperties and not all\u2014then how do we tell\nwhich properties serve to individuate a pair of distinct objects?\n\nReply: Similarity relations satisfy only restricted\nforms of LL. How then do we tell which properties are\npreserved by the same shape relation and which are not? It is\nno objection to the thesis that identity relations in general preserve\nsome properties and not others to demand to know which are which. At\nbest the objection points to a problem we must face anyway (for the\ncase of similarity). In general, a property is preserved by an\nequivalence relation if it \u201cspreads\u201d in an equivalence\nclass determined by the relation: If one member of the class has the\nproperty, then every member does. Every property spreads in a\nsingleton, as absolute identity demands.\n\nObjection 3: If identity statements are mere\nequivalencies, what distinguishes identity from mere similarity?\n\nReply: The distinction between identity and\nsimilarity statements (or sentences) is usually drawn in\nterms of the distinction between substantival and adjectival common\nnouns. If \\(F\\) is a common noun standing for a kind of\nthings, e.g., \u201chorse\u201d, then \u201c\\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d is a statement of identity, whereas if\n\\(F\\) is an a common noun standing for a kind of properties\nof things, then \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d is a\nstatement of similarity. (It\u2019s interesting to note that when the\nnoun is proper, i.e., a proper name, the result is a statement of\nsimilarity, not identity\u2014as in \u201cHe\u201ds not the same\nBill we knew before\u2019.) This distinction rests ultimately on the\nmetaphysical distinction between substance and attribute, object and\nproperty. While the distinction no doubt presupposes the concept of\nindividuation (the bundle theory, for example, presupposes that we\nhave the means to individuate properties), there is no obvious reason\nto suppose that it entails the denial of RI, i.e., the claim that no\ninstance of RI is true. For a beginner\u2019s review\u2014from an\nhistorical perspective\u2014of the issues concerning substance and\nattribute, see O\u2019Connor (1967); and for more recent and advanced\ndiscussion and bibliography, see the entry on\n properties.\n\nObjection 4: Consider the following alleged instance\nof RI:\n\n(1)\n\\(A\\) is the same word type as \\(B\\), but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent word tokens.\n\n\n\u201cIf \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 refer to the\nsame objects throughout (1), the first conjunct of (1) is not an\nidentity statement, and the counterexample (to the thesis that no\ninstance of RI is true) fails. If both conjuncts are identity\nstatements in the required sense, \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 must refer to word types in the first conjunct and\nword tokens in the second, and the counterexample fails\u201d (Perry\n1970, p. 189).\n\nReply: First, if \u201cin the required sense\u201d\nmeans \u201csatisfies LL\u201d, then the objection buys correctness\nonly at the price of begging the question. Advocates of relative\nidentity will maintain that the relation A is the same word type\nas \\(B\\) is an identity relation, defined on tokens, that does\nnot satisfy LL.\n\nSecondly, even if one insists that in this case intuition dictates\nthat if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to tokens in both conjuncts of (1), then\n\u201c\\(A\\) is the same word type as \\(B\\)\u201d expresses only the\nsimilarity relation: A and B are tokens of the same type,\nthere are other cases where, intuitively, both conjuncts of RI involve\nidentity relations and yet the relevant terms all refer to the same\nkind of things; for example,\n\n(2)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same dog but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are different\nphysical objects,\n\n\nas said of young Oscar and old Oscar. Here there is no temptation to\nsuppose that the relation A and B are the same dog is\nnot an identity relation. One may invoke a theory\u2014a\ntheory of temporal parts, for example\u2014that construes the\nrelation as a certain kind of similarity, but that is theory, not\npretheoretical intuition. It is no objection to the relativist\u2019s\ntheory, which holds in part that \u201c\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nthe same dog\u201d expresses a relation of primitive identity, that\nthere is an alternative theory according to which it expresses a\nsimilarity relation obtaining between two temporal parts of the same\nobject. Furthermore, in the case of (2), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer, again\nintuitively, to the same things in both conjuncts.\n\nThird, there are cases in which the relative identity view does\npossess an ontological advantage. Consider\n\n(3)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same piece of clay but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent statues.\n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are understood to refer to one sort of\nthing\u2014pieces of clay\u2014in the first conjunct and\nanother\u2014statues\u2014in the second conjunct. Assume that the\npiece of clay \\(c\\) denoted by \\(A\\) in the first conjunct\nconstitutes, at time \\(t\\), the statue \\(s.\\) Then assuming that\nstatues are physical objects, there are two distinct physical objects\nbelonging to different kinds occupying the same space at \\(t\\). Some,\nnotably Wiggins (1980), hold that this is entirely possible: Distinct\nphysical objects may occupy the same space at the same time, provided\nthey belong to different kinds. The temporal parts doctrine supports\nand encourages this view. A statue may be a temporal part of a\ntemporally extended piece of clay. But one statue, it seems, cannot be\na temporal part of another. Even so, however, the duality of\nconstituter and thing constituted is unparsimonious (cf. Lewis 1993),\nand the relativist is not committed to it.\n\nAgain, consider\n\n(4)\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same book but \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ndifferent copies (of the book).\n\n\nOne can say that in the first conjunct, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) refer to books\n(absolutely the same book), whereas in the second conjunct, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) refer to (absolutely distinct) copies. But the alleged duality\nof books and copies of books is unparsimonious and the relativist is\nnot committed to it. There is no reason to concede to the philosopher\nthat we do not actually purchase or read books; instead we\npurchase and read only copies of books. Any copy of a book is\njust as much the \u201cbook itself\u201d as is any other copy. Any\ncopy of a book is the same book as any other copy. Nelson\nGoodman once remarked that \u201cAny accurate copy of the text of a\npoem or novel is as much the original work as any other\u201d\n(Goodman 1968, p. 114). Goodman was not suggesting that the\ndistinction between poem and copy collapses. If it does collapse,\nhowever, we have an explanation of why any accurate copy is as much\nthe original work as any other: any such copy is the same work as any\nother.\n\nObjection 5: Geach remarks that \u201c[a]s for our\nrecognizing relative identity predicables: any equivalence relation\n\u2026 can be used to specify a criterion of relative\nidentity\u201d (Geach 1972, p. 249). But \u00a73 above contains a\ncounterexample. Some equivalence relations are defined in terms of the\nI-predicable of a theory and hence cannot serve as such. (Any pair of\nI-predicables for a fixed theory are equivalent.) In fact it seems\nthat any equivalence relation presupposes identity (cf. McGinn 2000).\nFor example, the relation x and y are the same color\npresupposes identity of colors, since it means that there are colors\n\\(C\\) and \\(C'\\) such that \\(x\\) has \\(C\\) and \\(y\\) has \\(C'\\), and\n\\(C = C'\\). Identity, therefore, is logically prior to\nequivalence.\n\nReply: This is a good objection. It does seem to\nshow, as the objector says, that identity is logically prior to\nordinary similarity relations. However, the difference between\nfirst-order and higher-order relations is relevant here.\nTraditionally, similarity relations such as x and y are the same\ncolor have been represented, in the way indicated in the\nobjection, as higher-order relations involving identities between\nhigher-order objects (properties). Yet this treatment may not be\ninevitable. In Deutsch (1997), an attempt is made to treat similarity\nrelations of the form \u201c\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same \\(F\\)\u201d\n(where \\(F\\) is adjectival) as primitive, first-order, purely logical\nrelations (see also Williamson 1988). If successful, a first-order\ntreatment of similarity would show that the impression that identity\nis prior to equivalence is merely a misimpression\u2014due to the\nassumption that the usual higher-order account of similarity relations\nis the only option.\n\nObjection 6: If on day 3, \\(c' = s_2\\), as the text\nasserts, then by NI, the same is true on day 2. But the text also\nasserts that on day 2, \\(c = s_2\\); yet \\(c \\ne c'\\). This is\nincoherent.\n\nReply: The term \\(s_2\\) is not an absolutely rigid\ndesignator and so NI does not apply.\n\nObjection 7: The notion of relative identity is\nincoherent: \u201cIf a cat and one of its proper parts are one and\nthe same cat, what is the mass of that one cat?\u201d (Burke 1994, p.\n138).\n\nReply: Young Oscar and Old Oscar are the same dog,\nbut it makes no sense to ask: \u201cWhat is the mass of that one\ndog\u201d? Given the possibility of change, identical objects may\ndiffer in mass. On the relative identity account, that means that\ndistinct logical objects that are the same \\(F\\) may differ in\nmass\u2014and may differ with respect to a host of other properties\nas well. Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are distinct physical\nobjects, and therefore distinct logical objects. Distinct physical\nobjects may differ in mass.\n\nObjection 8: We can solve the paradox of 101\nDalmatians by appeal to a notion of \u201calmost-identity\u201d\n(Lewis 1993). We can admit, in light of the \u201cproblem of the\nmany\u201d (Unger 1980), that the 101 dog parts are dogs, but we can\nalso affirm that the 101 dogs are not many; for they are \u201calmost\none\u201d. Almost-identity is not a relation of indiscernibility,\nsince it is not transitive, and so it differs from relative identity.\nIt is a matter of negligible difference. A series of negligible\ndifferences can add up to one that is not negligible.\n\nReply: The difference between Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 is not negligible and the two are not\nalmost-identical. Lewis concedes this point but proposes to combine\nalmost-identity with supervaluations to give a mixed solution to the\nparadox. The supervaluation solution starts from the assumption that\none and only one of the dog parts is a dog (and a Dalmatian, and\nOscar), but it doesn\u2019t matter which. It doesn\u2019t matter\nwhich because we haven\u2019t decided as much, and we aren\u2019t\ngoing to. Since it is true that any such decision renders one and only\none dog part a dog, it is plain-true, i.e., supertrue, that there is\none and only one dog in the picture. But it is not clear that this\napproach enjoys any advantage over that of relative identity; in fact,\nit seems to produce instances of RI. Compare: Fred\u2019s bicycle has\na basket attached to it. Ordinarily, our discourse slides over the\ndifference between Fred\u2019s bicycle with its basket attached and\nFred\u2019s bicycle minus the basket. (In this respect, the case of\nFred\u2019s bicycle differs somewhat from that of Oscar and\nOscar\u2212. We tend not to ignore that\ndifference.) In particular, we don\u2019t say that Fred has two\nbicycles even if we allow that Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus is a\nbicycle. Both relative identity and supervaluations validate this\nintuition. However, both relative identity and supervaluations also\naffirm that Fred\u2019s bicycle and Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are\nabsolutely distinct objects. That is, the statement that Fred\u2019s\nbicycle and Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are distinct is supertrue. So\nthe supervaluation technique affirms both that Fred\u2019s bicycle\nand Fred\u2019s bicycle-minus are distinct objects and that\nthere is one and only one (relevant) bicycle. That is RI, or close\nenough. The supervaluation approach is not so much an alternative to\nrelative identity as a form of it.\n\nObjection 9: One may argue that the plausibility of\nRI rests to a large degree on certain linguistic phenomena and that we\ndo not need it after all because these phenomena are in fact apparent\nand the notion of relative identity can be explained away. For\nexample, Moltmann (2013) has recently argued that some apparent\nstatements of sortal-relative identity can be analysed on linguistic\ngrounds as statements of absolute identity. Consider an example of\nsuch statements: \u201cThis is the same lump of clay but not the same\nstatue as that\u201d, which is uttered in front of, say, two\nphotographs: one presenting the clay and the other showing the statue\nmade out of the clay. Moltmann starts her analysis focussing on the\ntwo pronouns at stake: this and that, the so-called\nbare demonstratives. The analysis reveals two different functions\nthereof: referential and presentational. Due to the referential\nfunction a bare demonstrative picks up a unique feature, or a trope as\nMoltmann claims. Secondly, this feature (trope) is used to recognise\nits bearer (in any possible world that is accessible from the world\nwhere the pronoun is uttered). Now in the example above this\nrefers to a complex trope, say the complex composed of this particular\nbrownness and this roundness, and \u201cwith the help of\u201d this\ntrope maps to a lump of clay as a bearer of this trope. Similarly,\nthat refers to another complex trope, say this particular\nbrownness and this angularity and maps to a bearer of this trope. The\ncrucial assumption here is that the tropes in question may have\nmultiple bearers, e.g., the brownness and roundness is a trope borne\nboth by the clay and the statue. Moltmann\u2019s semantics of the\n(apparent) statements of sortal-relative identity of the form\n\u201cThis is the same \u2026 as that\u201d has it that such\nstatements are true if this refers to a trope such that at\nleast one, but not all, of its bearers is identical (in the sense of\nabsolute identity) to a bearer of the trope to which that\nrefers. So our sentence \u201cThis is the same lump of clay but not\nthe same statue as that\u201d is true when (i) one bearer of the\nthis trope is the same as a bearer of the that trope\nand (ii) another bearer of that first trope is not the same as a\nbearer of the other trope.\n\nReply: The semantics\noutlined by Moltmann has its ontological cost because its proponent\nneeds to acknowledge that a single trope may have multiple bearers.\nBut even if you are persuaded by her argumentation to this\ncontroversial position, you may still accept RI. Moltmann\u2019s\ntheory concerns a specific class of relative identity statements and\ndoes not directly affect the applications of RI described above, which\nneed not be rendered as identity statements involving bare\ndemonstratives. For instance, accepting this theory you are at liberty\nto say that the original and remodeled ship are the same ship but not\nthe same collection of planks, whereas the reassembled ship is the\nsame collection of planks as the original but not the same ship. So\neven if the whole body of linguistic evidence for RI can be explained\naway, we may use relative identity as a theoretical explanatory tool,\ne.g., to provide resolutions to the paradoxes described above.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anscombe, G.E.M. and P.
