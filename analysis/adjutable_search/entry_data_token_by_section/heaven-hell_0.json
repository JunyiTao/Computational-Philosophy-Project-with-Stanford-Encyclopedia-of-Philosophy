    "main_text": "Three Primary Eschatological Views\n1. Three Primary Eschatological Views\n\nLet theism in general be the belief that a supremely\npowerful, supremely wise, and supremely good (loving, just, merciful)\npersonal being exists as the Creator of the universe. Christian\ntheism is, of course, more specific than that, and Christian\ntheists typically make the following two-fold assumption: first, that\nthe highest possible good for created persons (true blessedness, if\nyou will) requires that they enter into a proper relationship (or even\na kind of union) with their Creator, and second, that a complete\nseverance from the divine nature, without even an implicit experience\nof God (see\n note 11)\n would be a terrifying evil. As C. S. Lewis once put it, union with\nthe divine \u201cNature is bliss and separation from it [an\nobjective] horror\u201d (1955, 232). Although most Christians would\nprobably agree with this, some may want additional clarity on the\nnature of the union and the separation in question here. But in any\ncase, whereas heaven is in general thought of as a realm in which\npeople experience the bliss of perfect fellowship and harmony with God\nand with each other, hell is in general thought of as a realm in which\npeople experience the greatest possible estrangement from God, the\ngreatest possible sense of alienation, and perhaps also an intense\nhatred of everyone including themselves.\n\nThe ideas of heaven and hell are also closely associated with the\nreligious idea of salvation, which in turn rests upon a\ntheological interpretation of the human condition. Even the\nnon-religious can perhaps agree that, for whatever reason, we humans\nbegin our earthly lives with many imperfections and with no\n(conscious) awareness of God. We also emerge and begin making choices\nin a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception, and behind\nour earliest choices lie a host of genetically determined inclinations\nand environmental (including social and cultural) influences. As young\nchildren, moreover, we initially pursue our own needs and interests as\nwe perceive (or misperceive) them. So the context in which we humans\nemerge with a first person perspective and then begin developing into\nminimally rational agents virtually guarantees, it seems, that we\nwould repeatedly misconstrue our own interests and pursue them in\nmisguided ways; it also includes many sources of misery, at least some\nof which\u2014the horror of war, horrifying examples of inhumanity to\nchildren, people striving to benefit themselves at the expense of\nothers, etc.\u2014are the product of misguided human choices. But\nother sources include such non-moral evils as natural disasters,\nsickness, and especially physical death itself.\n\nClearly, then, we all encounter in our natural environment many\nthreats to our immediate welfare and many obstacles, some of our own\nmaking and some not, to enduring happiness. The Christian\ninterpretation of this human condition thus postulates an initial\nestrangement from God, and the Christian religion then offers a\nprescription for how we can be saved from such estrangement; it\nteaches in particular that \u201cGod was in Christ, reconciling the\nworld unto himself\u201d (2 Cor. 5:19a\u2014KJV). But Christians\nalso disagree among themselves concerning the extent and ultimate\nsuccess of God\u2019s saving activity among human beings. Some\nbelieve that God will positively reject unrepentant sinners after a\ngiven deadline, typically thought of as the moment of physical death,\nand actively punish them forever after; others believe that God would\nnever reject any of God\u2019s own loved ones even though some of\nthem may freely reject God forever, thereby placing themselves in a\nkind of self-created hell; and still others believe that God\u2019s\nredemptive love will triumph in the end and will successfully bring\nreconciliation to all of those whom God has loved into existence in\nthe first place. So one way to organize our thinking here is against\nthe backdrop of the following inconsistent set of three\npropositions:\n\nAll human sinners are equal objects of God\u2019s\nredemptive love in the sense that God wills or aims to win over each\none of them over time and thereby to prepare each one of them for the\nbliss of union with the divine nature.\nGod\u2019s redemptive love will triumph in the end and\nsuccessfully win over each and every object of that love, thereby\npreparing each one of them for the bliss of union with the divine\nnature.\nSome human sinners will never be reconciled to God and will\ntherefore remain separated from the divine nature forever.\n\n\nIf this set of propositions is logically inconsistent, as it surely\nis, then at least one proposition in the set is false. In no way does\nit follow, of course, that only one proposition in the set is\nfalse, and neither does it follow that at least two of them are true.\nBut if someone does accept any two of these propositions, as virtually\nevery mainline Christian theologian does, then such a person has no\nchoice but to reject the\n third.[1]\n It is typically rather easy, moreover, to determine which proposition\na given theologian ultimately rejects, and we can therefore classify\ntheologians according to which of these propositions they do reject.\nSo that leaves exactly three primary eschatological views. Because the\nAugustinians, named after St. Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430),\nbelieve both that God\u2019s redemptive (or electing) love will\ntriumph in the end (proposition (2)) and that some human sinners will\nnever be reconciled to God (proposition (3)), they finally reject the\nidea that God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners\nequally (proposition (1)); because the Arminians, named after Jacobus\nArminius (1560\u20131609) for his opposition to the Augustinian\nunderstanding of limited election, believe both that God\u2019s\nredemptive love extends to all human sinners equally (proposition (1))\nand that some of these sinners will never be reconciled to God\n(proposition (3)), they finally reject the idea that God\u2019s\nredemptive love will triumph in the end (proposition (2)); and\nfinally, because the Christian universalists believe both that\nGod\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners equally\n(proposition (1)) and that this love will triumph in the end\n(proposition (2)), they finally reject altogether the idea that some\nhuman sinners will never be reconciled to God (proposition (3)). \n\nSo here, then, are three quite different systems of theology.\nAccording to Augustinian theology, God\u2019s redemptive love cannot\nbe thwarted forever, but the scope of that love is restricted to a\nlimited elect. According to Arminian theology, God\u2019s redemptive\nlove extends to all human sinners equally, but that love can be\nthwarted by factors, such as certain human choices, over which God has\nno direct causal control. And according to the theology of Christian\nuniversalism, God\u2019s redemptive love extends to all human sinners\nequally and God\u2019s will to save each one of them cannot be\nthwarted forever. Accordingly, a question that may now arise is,\n\u201cWhich system of theology best preserves the praiseworthy\ncharacter and the glory of God?\u201d\n",
