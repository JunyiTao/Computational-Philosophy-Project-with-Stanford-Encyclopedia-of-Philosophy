Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Writings and Their Background\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s surviving works contain well over a\nthousand pages that are devoted to explaining the contents of\nAristotle\u2019s logical writings and aimed at educated readers of\nArabic. Much of this material reveals al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nstrong interest in the nature of language.\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s intellectual background was not so\nmuch Aristotle himself. Rather it was the Aristotelian part of the\nsyllabus of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy that flourished in\nAlexandria (in Egypt) in the fifth and sixth centuries (see\nD\u2019Ancona 2022). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us that\neventually \u201cinstruction was moved from Alexandria to\nAntioch\u201d (in Syria), until the last members of the school\nscattered \u201ctaking their books with them\u201d. He says that he\nhimself studied with one of these last members,\nY\u016b\u1e25ann\u0101 bin \u1e24ayl\u0101n, and together they read\nAristotle up to the end of Posterior Analytics. He adds that\nthe Alexandrian school came to describe the part of Aristotle\u2019s\nOrganon from modal logic onwards as \u201cthe part that is\nnot read\u201d, since under the Christians the modal material had\nbeen kept hidden. (Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s account is in a\nlost work quoted by the historian Ibn Ab\u012b Usaybi\u2018a\n[\u2018Uy\u016bn 604f]; see the translation in Fakhry 2002:\n159.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has oversimplified the history (see Lameer\n1997 and Watt 2008). But he correctly implies that his understanding\nof Aristotle is based on the Alexandrian syllabus and its later\noffshoots in the Middle East. For example, the account of logic in his\ninfluential [Catalogue] has been shown to be an edited\ntranslation of a work from the Alexandrian teaching\n materials.[1]\n So for understanding al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b it becomes important to\nknow when he is giving his own considered view and when he is merely\npassing on parts of the Alexandrian syllabus. As yet there is no\nconsensus about this, or about the order in which he wrote his\nworks.\n\nThe Alexandrian Neoplatonists saw philosophy as an avenue by which we\ncan achieve happiness through knowledge of The One (see Wildberg\n2021). To add intellectual rigor to this mystical endeavor they\nincluded the logical writings of Aristotle in the early stages of\ntheir teaching syllabus. They devised a body of introductory texts to\nexplain how Aristotle\u2019s logic saves us from incorrect thinking\nand acting, and why Aristotle devised his logic syllabus\u2014his\nOrganon\u2014in the form that he gave\n it.[2]\n Some features of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s presentation are\nmost easily explained in terms of the Alexandrians. For example, the\nAristotelian part of their syllabus, after Porphyry\u2019s\nEisagoge, began with Aristotle\u2019s Categories,\nso al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b duly seeks reasons why categories are an\nessential first step in logic. Their Organon also included\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and his Poetics; so\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains why the arts of rhetoric and poetry\nare really parts of logic. If their Organon had contained a\nbook on music, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b would have explained why\nmusical theory is a branch of\n logic.[3]\n (On music see\n Section 10\n below.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s logical writings take various forms.\nSome of them are Long Commentaries on works of Aristotle, which\ndissect Aristotle\u2019s text in sometimes excruciating detail; only\nthe Long Commentary on De Interpretatione survives in full,\nthough we have parts of others. More friendly are the Epitomes, in\nwhich al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b rewrites works in the Organon\nfrom his own point of view. There are also a number of texts that\nserve as introductions to the Organon, though they are not\nnecessarily elementary. We call attention to three works in this last\ngroup. The first, [Indication], teaches that logic is the art\nof making correct discriminations, and hence is the key to happiness\nin life as a whole. It also explains that we must study language\nbefore we study logic. The second, [Expressions], is a sequel\nto [Indication] and introduces the vocabulary of logic. \n\nThe third work is the extraordinarily original and insightful\n[Letters], which weaves together language, logic, and\nmetaphysics. We will take this work as the best basis for\nunderstanding al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s overall view of\nlanguage and logic. Sections 2 to 5 below will review what we take to\nbe the core of this view. The remaining\n Sections 6 to 10\n will pick up particular themes.\n\nBesides the Alexandrian material, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b was able to\ncall on highly professional Arabic translations of the books of the\nOrganon. He also had translations of some logical writers\nfrom the Roman Empire, such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius. He is not known to have made any use of earlier Arabic\ntexts relating to logic, such as the Logic of Ibn\nal-Muqaffa\u2018 and writings of al-Kind\u012b. (Zimmermann [1981:\nlxviii\u2013xcviii] and Lameer [1994: Chapter 1] discuss what earlier\nlogical writings were available to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b. See also\nWalzer [1962: 129\u2013136] for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nsources on Aristotle\u2019s poetics.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s work on logic and language had a\ndirect effect on several Arabic authors in the two hundred years after\nhis\n death.[4]\n These include Ibn B\u0101jja (in Latin Avempace), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n(Avicenna), Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (Algazel), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes).\nHe also influenced a number of medieval Jewish authors including\nMaimonides. The Latins knew him as Alfarabius or Alpharabius or\nAbunaser. His influence can be seen in Scholastic treatments of\ndeterminism, poetic argument, and the classification of\n sciences.[5]\n2. The Origin of Languages\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b describes how a language develops within a\ncommunity. In [Letters] (114, 115) 134.16\u2013135.14 he\npictures a community whose members have concepts\n(ma\u2018q\u016bl\u0101t, literally \u201cintellected\nthings\u201d, or \u201cintelligibles\u201d in Scholastic\nterminology) that allow them to pick out identifiable objects in the\nexternal world, either individually or as kinds of thing. He refers to\nthese concepts drawn from perception of the external world as\n\u201cprimary concepts\u201d. These people have beliefs, and they\nare able to reason about the world, to deliberate about their actions,\nand to communicate by pointing. But as yet these people have no\nlanguage.\n\nThe first development towards language is that the people come to\nrealize that they can communicate their needs to each other better if\nthey agree to label some objects and concepts with vocal sounds. This\nsets up a conventional correlation between simple (i.e., uncompounded)\nprimary concepts and words, and eventually this correlation comes to\nbe accepted by the whole community. The words are said to\n\u201csignify\u201d the concepts to which they are correlated.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b envisages that a lawmaker will regulate the\ncorrelation and add some words to it for the benefit of the community\n([Letters] (120) 138.4\u20138). Thus a national lexicon is\ncreated; the sounds that are used form a national alphabet. \n\nOnce the idea has become established that words signify meanings, the\ncommunity will aim to develop the language so that words imitate the\n\u201cordering\u201d or \u201cregime\u201d\n(inti\u1e93\u0101m) of the primary concepts\n([Letters] (122) 139.2\u20134). This regime includes any\nrelationships that the concepts have as concepts. For example, two\nconcepts may be similar; so an effort will be made to find a pair of\nsimilar words to express these concepts. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nnotes that this effort may misfire and result in homonymy\u2014a\nsingle word being used for two different concepts ([Letters]\n(124) 140.8\u201310). The pressure to copy similarities also leads to\nmetaphors ([Letters] (127) 141.10).\n\nAlso some concepts are derived from others; the word for the derived\nconcept should be grammatically derived from the word for the other\nconcept. The words for underived concepts should not be grammatically\nderived. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b notes that in practice this\ncorrelation sometimes fails. For example, he takes it that the\nparticiple \u201cliving\u201d (\u1e25ayy) is derived, but\nit is sometimes used to signify the underived concept\n\u201canimal\u201d ([Letters] (26) 74.16, (36) 81.18f).\nLikewise the underived concept \u201cis\u201d is sometimes signified\nby the derived passive participle mawj\u016bd\n([Letters] (84) 113.9).\n\nAlso concepts can be combined into compound concepts, and this\npossibility will be copied in the language too. ([Letters]\n(126) 140.20\u2013141.3.) Taking this view, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nmakes a number of remarks that contain the first explicit formulations\nof the thesis of\n compositionality.[6]\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b clearly believes that mismatches between\nwords and concepts are a bad thing, but it\u2019s less clear why he\nbelieves this, or what he thinks should be done about it. The original\nmatching was set up by an artless consensus of the community,\npresumably because it served some social purpose.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never analyses in detail what this purpose\nmight be, or, for example, how it would be damaged by using derived\nwords for underived concepts. Does he really fear that a mismatch\ncould lead to a breakdown in communication, even if the whole\ncommunity adopts the mismatch? Germann (2015/6: 138f) has suggested\nthat his fear is more specific: he worries that if mismatches develop,\nteachers\u2014including philosophy teachers\u2014may be unable to\npass information reliably to their students. \n\nAnother possibility is that he is afraid that a mismatch will cause\nerrors in logical reasoning, because the relationships between\nconcepts that make an argument valid will not be visible in the\ncorresponding words. In [Expressions] 102.8\u201315, after\ntelling us that demonstrations and syllogisms take place in internal\nspeech, not external, he comments that\n\n\nmost students don\u2019t have the ability to imagine how concepts are\nordered in the mind, so instead one takes expressions that signify the\nconcepts, so as to enable the student\u2019s mind to make a\ntransition from them to the concepts. \n\n\nAny mismatch between concepts and words could disrupt this process.\n\n\nIn any event, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is in no hurry to reform the\nlanguage. He is content to continue using the word\nmawj\u016bd for \u201cis\u201d. \n\nThere is one part of the regime of primary concepts that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never suggests that language should\nreplicate. Some concepts are more inclusive than others; for example,\n\u201canimal\u201d is more inclusive than \u201chuman\u201d.\nFollowing one reading of Aristotle, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes\nthat there are ten maximally inclusive simple primary concepts\n(ignoring \u201cthing\u201d, \u201cconcept\u201d,\n\u201cone\u201d, and \u201cbeing\u201d which include all\nconcepts). He refers to these ten concepts as \u201ccategories\u201d\n(maq\u016bl\u0101t, not to be confused with\nma\u2018q\u016bl\u0101t above). But we will prefer to call\nthem by their alternative name \u201csupreme genera\u201d, because\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b confusingly also applies the name\n\u201ccategory\u201d to all simple primary concepts. Languages do\ndistinguish the minimally inclusive concepts, those that apply to just\none thing, by using proper names for them. But it\u2019s unrealistic\nto expect languages to copy the rest of this regime of inclusions, and\nwe know of no place where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b suggests that it\nshould.\n\nSome of the historical processes mentioned above will have the effect\nof making people think about the primary concepts and their regime.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b points out that as a result, people will now\nhave concepts that classify concepts in the soul rather than\nidentifiable objects in the external world. So these are a new kind of\nconcept, and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b calls them \u201csecondary\nconcepts\u201d (often translated as \u201csecond\nintelligibles\u201d). Thinking about secondary concepts will give us\n\u201ctertiary concepts\u201d, and so on to infinity. As examples of\nsecondary concepts, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b mentions\n\u201cgenus\u201d, \u201cspecies\u201d, \u201cmore/less\ninclusive\u201d, \u201cknown\u201d, \u201cconcept\u201d. (All\nthis is in [Letters] (7,8)\n 64.9\u201365.8.)[7]\n\nAlthough al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b doesn\u2019t recommend any\nparticular reforms of language, he does make some detailed\nrecommendations for a philosopher who is seeking to translate\nphilosophy from another language and needs to introduce technical\nterms for the purpose. ([Letters] (155) 157.19\u2013158.21.)\nIt would be interesting to compare al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nrecommendations with his own practice, if we could be sure which of\nthe technical terms used for translating Greek writers we can credit\nto him. \n\nHe does introduce some new names for notions that he himself\npioneered. Three noteworthy examples are: \n\n He introduces yuf\u012bdu \u201cprovides\u201d as a\nterm of art for saying that the answer to a question posed in a\nphilosophical debate \u201cprovides\u201d information (cf.\n Section 4\n below). The root is rare in his writings except for this usage, and\nits use in a related sense in linguistic writers probably antedates\nhis use of it (see Giolfo & Hodges 2018). \n He borrows from the linguists the term\nistithn\u0101\u2019 (\u201cexception\u201d) as a name for\nthe inference rules of his hypothetical logic (cf.\n Section 6 below).\n The choice rests on a formal similarity between these rules and a\nproperty of the syntactic construction known as\n \u201cexception\u201d.[8]\n\n His choice of the name \u201csecondary concept\u201d is based\non an analogy with Porphyry\u2019s theory of \u201csecond\nimpositions\u201d, i.e., words for talking about\n words.[9]\n\n3. The Origins of Syllogistic Arts\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s tale of the origins of language runs\non into a tale of how language makes it possible to handle concepts in\nnew ways. For al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b one key difference between\nlanguage and concepts is that language is public and allows\ncommunication between people. Hence many of the new uses of concepts\nhave to do with social interaction. In each case he is interested in\nthe development of new skills for handling concepts. Skills involve\ninstruments and rules for handling these instruments; so the\nappearance of a new skill involves an acceptance of the rules\n(qaw\u0101n\u012bn, singular q\u0101n\u016bn) for\nhandling its instruments. A bundle of associated skills and their\nrules is called an \u201cart\u201d\n(\u1e63in\u0101\u2018a). \n\nThe first new art that he calls attention to is rhetoric\n(khi\u1e6d\u0101ba), the art of the orator, which uses\nconcepts in order to persuade people to do or believe certain things.\nThe main users of this skill are political and religious leaders, who\nemploy it in order to assert their authority. Alongside rhetoric\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b mentions the art of poetry\n(shi\u2018r), which uses concepts in order to bring people\nto certain states of mind. He sees this art as most useful for\nreligious leaders. He also mentions an art which he calls the art of\nsophistry. This art embodies the skill of producing bad arguments from\nfalse premises. It\u2019s hard to see what could have led him to the\nconclusion that there is such an art, beyond the fact that the\nAlexandrian syllabus contained, wedged between a book on dialectical\nmethods and one on rhetorical methods, Aristotle\u2019s treatise\nSophistical Refutations. Aristotle\u2019s treatise is\nusually understood to be teaching the art of detecting and refuting\nbad arguments, not that of creating them! \n\nOne effect of the introduction of language is that people are able to\nlearn the opinions of other people. They will inevitably discover that\nsome people disagree with them, not least in speculations about the\nnature of the universe. So the art of dialectics or debate\n(jadal) is introduced in order to resolve differences of\nopinion between two people. ([Letters] (140,141)\n150.2\u2013151.7.) But a dialectical resolution of a disagreement is\nno guarantee of the truth of the agreed conclusion; one of the\ndebaters might just be better at arguing ([Debate]\n40.9\u201313). \n\nA realization that dialectics doesn\u2019t lead to certain truth will\ninspire some individuals to seek other methods that do. At this point\nthe community discovers the art of \u201cdemonstration\u201d\n(burh\u0101n), which establishes truths with certainty.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes that among the Greeks this art was\nachieved by Plato:\n\n\nPlato was the first to be aware of the demonstrative methods and to\ndistinguish them from the dialectical, sophistical, rhetorical, and\npoetical methods. But from his point of view they were distinguished\nin use and according to matter, and in terms of what guidance he\nreceived from his considerations at leisure and his superior natural\nintelligence. He didn\u2019t prescribe universal rules for them.\nAfterwards Aristotle did prescribe such rules in his book\nPosterior Analytics. ([Rhetoric] 55.13\u201317)\n\n\nIt was a commonplace in the Neoplatonic schools that the high point of\nlogic was Posterior Analytics with its treatment of knowledge\nwith certainty. The Neoplatonists also considered that Aristotle had\narranged his Organon so that the path up to this summit\nthrough Categories, De Interpretatione, and\nPrior Analytics assembled the tools of logic, and the\ndownward slope from Posterior Analytics onwards allowed the\nstudent to apply these tools within demonstrative methods, dialectical\nmethods, sophistical methods, rhetorical methods, and poetic methods\nin turn. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b inherited this view of Aristotle;\nsee [Aristotle] pp. 82\u201393.\n\nHe also inherited the zeal of the Neoplatonic schools to catalogue the\ningredients of logic. Thus in [Letters] he catalogued the\nlogical arts according to the social needs that brought them into\nexistence, while in [Aristotle] he catalogued them according\nto the books of the Organon that Aristotle devoted to them.\nThese two principles of classification led to essentially the same\ndivisions between logical arts. But sometimes he used principles that\ndraw distinctions in different places. For example in\n[Syllogism] he classified kinds of logic by the syllogisms\n(i.e. two-premise inferences) that they used; we come to this\nclassification in Section 6 below. Elsewhere he classified kinds of\nlogic by the kinds of premise that they accepted in their syllogisms.\n\n\nAll the kinds of logic, even the less syllogistic kinds, must have\nrules about what to adopt as starting premises. In the case of\nrhetoric, practicality implies that the orator should choose premises\nthat the audience will accept; likewise in dialectics it makes sense\nto start with premises that have some plausibility.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believes that in practice the community will\ninsist on restrictions that add a note of objectivity: for example,\nthat experts agree to the premise, or that nobody positively disagrees\nwith it. He formulates some conditions along these lines, including\nthat the premises must be at least \u201cstandard\u201d\n(massh\u016br) or \u201creceived\u201d\n(maqb\u016bl). (For discussion of such conditions and where\nthey apply, see Aouad 1992 and Black 1990: Chapter 5A. Chatti 2017\nreviews how al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b catalogues the starting points of\ninferences in hypothetical logic. Kleven 2023 studies the treatment of\nthe starting points of reasoning in some of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s introductory essays, and adds some\ninteresting information about the manuscripts.)\n\nRhetorical reasoning might be the hardest to make sense of,\nparticularly when [Letters] suggests that the rhetorician\u2019s\njob is done when he or she has persuaded the audience. Surely that aim\ncould be achieved by means that don\u2019t involve logic at all? But\nrecently it has come to be accepted that the Latin essay\n[Didascalia] published in [Rhetoric] is probably a\ntranslation of the prologue to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s lost\nLong Commentary on Rhetoric. In fact the work goes way beyond\nvague remarks about methods of persuasion; see Woerther 2020. For\nexample al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b observes that medical reasoning about\nwhat remedies to apply to this present invalid, and agricultural\nreasoning about how to increase the yield of this particular field,\ncannot be demonstrative since they apply only to this particular\nindividual (invalid or field); so we have to take them as rhetorical\nreasoning (Woerther (2020 p. 346)). On this reckoning, much of the\nreasoning of our most respected experts must count as rhetoric. \n\nIn sections 23 and 24 towards the end of Prior Analytics ii,\nAristotle discusses argument by induction and argument by analogy,\nwith a view to showing that both of them are reducible to syllogism.\nSince [Syllogism] is an epitome of Prior Analytics,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b closes the book with some sections in which\nhe gives his own reductions of induction and analogy to syllogism.\nSome manuscripts of [Syllogism], and some manuscripts of the\nlater work [Short\n Syllogism],[10]\n include a pair of essays which we will refer to as the Tailpiece; the\nfirst essay is on the logical device of \u201ctransfer\u201d, and\nthe second is on the application of this device to reduce arguments in\nIslamic jurisprudence (fiqh) to syllogisms. In the first of\nthese two essays al-Farabi refers to a number of named argument forms\n(for example \u201ctransfer from the observed to the\nunobserved\u201d), and it is clear that he is referring to earlier\ndebates about these argument forms; but there is no agreement on\nwhether the debates were in Roman Empire medical circles or in Islamic\ntheology. \n\nOne particular strand in this complex is a distinction that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b makes between two forms of analogy, which he\ndescribes as ta\u1e25l\u012bl and tark\u012bb\nrespectively. Some authors have read these words as\n\u201canalysis\u201d and \u201csynthesis\u201d respectively, and\ntried to read these as descriptions of two different kinds of formal\nproof. But this is certainly wrong, since the distinction that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself draws between the two kinds of\nargument is not about the form of the resulting proof, but about the\ncriteria for success in the search for a middle term.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself is a little conflicted at this point;\nin loyalty to Aristotle he wants to emphasise the reduction to\nsyllogism, but the point he makes about search, which is central for\nhis application to fiqh in the second essay, is not about the\nform of the final syllogistic proof at all. (See Chatti and Hodges\n2020 for further details on the Tailpiece, and Hodges 2020 for the\nincreasing interest in search algorithms in this\n period.)[11]\n\nFurther remarks comparing al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s dialectics with\nIslamic fiqh can be found in Gyekye (1989) and Young (2017:\n539\u2013543).\n4. Requests and Questions\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has explained that language grew out of a\nneed to communicate requests. Requests and questions of various kinds\nare a central feature of his thinking. At [Debate] 43.2f he\ndistinguishes two main kinds of request: those that are requests for a\ncommitment, and those that are requests for knowledge or information.\nThis division corresponds to the roles of questions in debate and in\nscience respectively. We begin with debate.\n4.1 Questions in Debate\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b cites Aristotle as saying that the primary\naim in debate is to refute proposed views; reaching agreement is a\nsecondary aim ([Debate] 14.7\u20139). Accordingly the rules\nof debate provide that one of the debaters, known as the\n\u201cquestioner\u201d (s\u0101\u2019il), has the role of\nrefuting the views offered by the other debater (the\n\u201cresponder\u201d, muj\u012bb). It\u2019s also the\nquestioner\u2019s task to elicit from the responder commitments to\nstatements. (Committing is called \u201cconceding\u201d or\n\u201csubmitting\u201d, tasl\u012bm.) The questioner must\nthen try to refute these statements and the responder must try to\ndefend them. The questioner elicits a commitment by presenting to the\nresponder a pair of incompatible possibilities, and the responder must\nchoose which possibility to defend. This pair of incompatible\npossibilities is referred to as \u201cwhat was sought after\u201d\n(ma\u1e6dl\u016bb, in Latin quaesitum), or the\n\u201cquestion\u201d (mas\u2019ala). \n\nThe simplest case is where the questioner requires the responder to\ncommit to a view on whether some primary concept is instantiated in\nthe world. For example, \u201cIs there or is there not a\nvacuum?\u201d More complicated, because it combines two concepts, is\na question like \u201cIs the sky spherical or not?\u201d More\nbizarre, \u201cStone and human, which of the two is animal?\u201d\n([Debate] 43.16\u201320) When the responder has made a\ncommitment, the questioner must devise a syllogism whose conclusion\ncontradicts the commitment, and then attempt to get the responder to\ncommit to the premises of this syllogism and to its validity. The\nresponder is allowed to challenge on any of these points, whereupon\nthe two participants swap roles. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b comments that the rules of debate have been\nfound useful for other purposes besides resolving differences of\nopinion. For example, in demonstrative science debate trains the\nparticipants to be nimble and systematic thinkers; it clears out of\nthe way sophistical nonsense, and gives prima facie conclusions that\ncan then be checked by demonstrative methods. In fact it\u2019s not\nhumanly possible to reach philosophical truth without engaging in\ndebate. ([Debate] 29.21\u201338.3.) The relationship between\nquestioner and responder can serve as a template for the relationship\nof teacher to pupil, so far as this is not simply passing information\nfrom teacher to pupil. It can also be a basis for collaborative\nresearch. ([Demonstration] 77.1\u201383.9.)\n4.2 Questions Seeking Information\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s treatment of information-seeking\nquestions is strongly influenced by two contexts in which\nAristotle\u2019s Organon uses question words. The first of\nthese is in Categories, where Aristotle (at least as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b reads him) classifies primary concepts under\nthe ten supreme genera. Aristotle explains his classification partly\nthrough question words: \u201chow much\u201d (Arabic kam),\n\u201chow\u201d (kayfa), \u201cwhere\u201d\n(ayna), \u201cwhen\u201d (mat\u0101).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b takes note of most of these question words,\nand adds two more: \u201cwhat\u201d (m\u0101) and\n\u201cwhich\u201d (ayyu) ([Letters] (166) 165.17,\n(183) 181.16.) In [Expressions] 47.5\u201312 he notes that\nthe answers to some of these questions can be classified by the\nquestion word or a word derived from it: \u201cquantity\u201d\n(kamiyya), \u201cquality\u201d (kayfiyya),\n\u201cquiddity\u201d or \u201cwhatness\u201d\n(m\u0101hiyya). (See the discussion of these questions in\nDiebler 2005.)\n\nThe second context is the second book of Posterior Analytics.\nIn the opening lines of this book Aristotle lists the four\n\u201cthings that we seek\u201d, namely that it is so (annahu\ny\u016bjadu), why it is (li-m\u0101dh\u0101), what it is\n(m\u0101) and which it is (ayyu). In\n[Letters] (210) 200.16 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b adds the\nquestion \u201cis it the case that\u201d (hal), which turns\nAristotle\u2019s \u201cthat it is\u201d into a question.\n\nLarge parts of both [Expressions] and [Letters] are\ndevoted to explaining how we can elicit philosophical information by\nasking these and similar\n questions.[12]\n Thus for each primary concept we can ask \u201cWhat is it\u201d?\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b defines the genus (jins) of the\nconcept to be the answer to this question. By asking \u201cwhich\nthing\u201d (in that genus), we get a more specific description that\nprovides the species (naw\u2018) below the genus.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b explains how further questions can elicit the\ndifferentiae and the definitions of concepts. The\n\u201cessence\u201d (dh\u0101t) of a concept consists of\nthe concepts included in the definition of the concept; these concepts\nin the essence are also described as \u201cconstitutive\u201d\n(muqawwim) for the concept. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tries hard to convince us that the\nphilosophers\u2019 questions are a natural extension of everyday\nquestions. (Diebler 2005 draws a plausible comparison with ordinary\nlanguage philosophy.) But the effort hardly succeeds. In what everyday\ncontext would we ask, about a date-palm, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d and\naccept the answer \u201cIt\u2019s a body\u201d? ([Letters]\n(167) 166.16) The outcome is that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nunintentionally raises problems that are still resonant in the\nphilosophy of questions. Compare \u201cIt\u2019s a body\u201d with\nthe answer \u201c[He] is a person who is over three inches\ntall\u201d discussed by Cross and Roelofsen 2018.\n5. The Definition of Logic\n\nIn his [Demonstration] (64.5\u20137)\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us:\n\n\nTwo arts or sciences differ through having different subjects\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u2018). If their subjects are identical\nthen the arts or sciences are identical; if their subjects are\ndifferent then the arts or sciences are different. Their subjects can\ndiffer either by having different features (a\u1e25w\u0101l,\nsingular \u1e25\u0101l) or in themselves. \n\n\nThus an art or science\u2014al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is very little\nexercised about the difference between the two\u2014studies some\nentities called its subjects, and it ascribes to these entities some\nfeatures. Like other Aristotelians, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b flips\nbetween saying (for example) that the subjects of arithmetic are\nnumbers and that the subject of arithmetic is number; the two\nlocutions mean the same.\n\nIn [Letters] sections 11\u201318 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nundertakes to identify several arts or sciences in these terms, namely\n\u201cthe art of logic and the sciences of nature, politics,\nmathematics and metaphysics\u201d. The first step is to identify\ntheir subjects. In all these cases, he says, the \u201cprimary\nsubjects\u201d are the primary concepts ([Letters] 66.20f).\nFor example, in mathematics we study primary concepts from the point\nof view of quantity, abstracting from their other features\n([Letters] (15) 67.19\u201368.5). (See Druart 2007 and Menn\n2008 on the important question of how metaphysics fits into this\npicture.)\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us what features of the primary\nconcepts are studied in logic:\n\n\nInsofar as [the primary concepts] are signified by expressions, and\ninsofar as they are universals, and insofar as they are predicates or\nsubjects, and insofar as they are defined in terms of each other, and\ninsofar as they are asked about and taken in a question about them,\nthey are logical. They are taken so as to investigate the compounds of\nthem, one with another, where the aforementioned things attach to\nthem, and the features of the compounds after they have been\ncompounded. ([Letters] (12)\n 67.1\u20135).[13]\n\n\n\nHe gives no examples, but here is one. In his book\n[Syllogism] 27.6f he claims that the following argument is a\nvalid syllogism: \n\n\nNo stone is an animal. Some body is an animal.\n\nThis yields: Some body is not a stone.\n\n\nWe can paraphrase his claim: \n\n\n(*)\nIf a first sentence is taken as universal negative with subject\n\u201cstone\u201d and predicate \u201canimal\u201d, and a second\nsentence is existential affirmative etc., and a third sentence etc.,\nthen the third sentence follows from the first two.\n\n\n\nThis paraphrase (*) illustrates why \u201cpredicate\u201d and\n\u201csubject\u201d are listed among the logical features, and also\nwhy logic has to consider compounds of primary concepts (since the\nthree sentences express propositions, which are compounds of\nconcepts). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s reference to being\n\u201casked about and taken in a question about them\u201d could\nrefer either to dialectical questions, or to the questions that\nextract information about concepts, or possibly to both.\n\nThe features listed as characterizing the art of logic are concepts\nthat classify other concepts, and so they are secondary concepts. This\ndistinguishes logic from mathematics and natural science. For example,\nnatural science finds causes, but these causes are \u201cnot outside\nthe categories\u201d ([Letters] (16) 68.17).\n\nBy describing simple primary concepts as the \u201cfirst\u201d or\n\u201cprimary\u201d subjects of logic, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nsuggests that there might be further subjects of logic. This makes\nsense; why shouldn\u2019t the rules of logic apply to secondary\nconcepts just as much as to primary concepts? In fact the way\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has set things up would allow him to explain\nhow this should go. Laws about secondary concepts will need tertiary\nconcepts. But there is no need to restate the laws of logic using\ntertiary concepts, because \u201cthe features that attach to the\nprimary concepts are exactly the same as those that attach to the\nsecondary concepts\u201d, and so on all the way up\n([Letters] (9) 65.16f). \n\nThere is an obvious criticism of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\ndefinition of logic, namely that the features that he lists are too\nvague. For example, how could we use his list to determine whether the\nart of poetry is or is not a part of logic? The real problem is that\nfor al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself with his Neoplatonic heritage,\nlogic consists of whatever Aristotle said in the Organon, and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never comes near finding any abstract way of\ncharacterizing this body of\n material.[14]\n\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b gives an even vaguer characterization of the\nsubjects of logic in his [Catalogue] (59.9\u201311):\n\n\nAs for the subjects of logic, about which it gives rules, they are\nconcepts insofar as expressions signify them, and expressions insofar\nas they signify concepts.\n\n\nThis definition could have been copied from a text in the Neoplatonic\ntradition.\n\nWe return briefly to the question why al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nincludes the subject of categories in a logic syllabus. Commentaries\nin the Alexandrian tradition normally started with a statement of the\npurpose of the material to be discussed.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s epitome [Categories] has no\nsuch statement, but the surviving fragments of the longer\n[Commentary on Categories] do address the question. They tell\nus (p. 196) that Aristotle\u2019s Categories was intended to\ncatalogue the simple universal primary concepts, but Aristotle found\nit sufficient to catalogue the ten supreme genera instead. Some people\n(p. 202) didn\u2019t think Categories was specifically\nintended for logic; but \u201cunder the conditions we have mentioned,\nthe contents of Categories turn out to be a specific part of\nlogic\u201d. But in fact no such conditions have been mentioned, at\nleast in the surviving fragments. What needs to be shown is that the\nfeatures (the a\u1e25w\u0101l) of categories studied in the\nfirst book of the syllabus are ones that will serve some purpose in\nlater books. But this issue is not addressed at all.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does address it in [Rhetoric]\n87.16\u201389.4, where he says that the terms of premises can be in\nany of the ten supreme genera, in any combination. This only confirms\nthe suspicion that the supreme genera are irrelevant to logical\nreasoning.\n6. Tools for Inference\n\nIn this section we run quickly through\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s formal systems of logic. We assume\nsome knowledge of Aristotle\u2019s syllogistics, as in Smith (2022).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b discusses four logical systems: 6.1\nCategorical syllogisms, 6.2 hypothetical syllogisms, 6.3 modal\nsyllogisms, 6.4 demonstrative syllogisms.\n6.1 Categorical Logic\n\nIn [Syllogism] and [Short Syllogism]\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b recognizes three figures of categorical\nsyllogisms, following\n Aristotle.[15]\n In these three figures he recognizes respectively four, four, and six\nvalid moods, as listed by Smith (2022) but not always in the same\norder. (For example in [Syllogism] he puts Darii\nbefore Celarent). Following Aristotle again, he regards the\nfirst figure syllogisms as \u201cperfect\u201d, i.e., self-evident\nand not in need of justification. For the moods in second and third\nfigures he gives justifications by reduction to first figure,\nfollowing Aristotle in the main. (His chief departure from Aristotle\nin these justifications is that he never uses proof by reductio ad\nabsurdum, though he does recognize such proofs as valid.)\nAristotle\u2019s justification of\n Darapti[16]\n relies on the conversion implication: from \u201cEvery B is\nan A\u201d infer \u201cSome A is a B\u201d\n(cf. [Syllogism] 30.3). This implication fails to hold if we\nallow \u201cEvery B is an A\u201d to be true when\nthere are no Bs. Accordingly al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b declares\nthat \u201cEvery B is an A\u201d is false unless there\nis at least one B ([Categories] 124.14). Though he\nsometimes seems to forget he said this, he is the earliest logician on\nrecord as having spelled out this implication of \u201cEvery B\nis an A\u201d.\n\nProbably his main difference from Aristotle in categorical syllogisms\nis his treatment of the pairs of formal premises (i.e., with letters\nfor terms) where Aristotle says \u201cno syllogism occurs\u201d in\nthe sense that no syllogistic conclusion follows validly.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b calls these premise-pairs\n\u201cnonproductive\u201d (ghayr muntij). Aristotle had\nused the fact that valid inference rules preserve truth as a means to\nproving nonproductivity of a formal premise-pair; for any proposed\nconclusion, he found nouns that could be put for the letters, in such\na way that the premises came out true and the conclusion false. During\nthe Roman Empire period a tendency developed for logicians to skip\nthese proofs and fall back instead on \u201claws of syllogism\u201d\nthat were supposed to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a\npremise-pair to be productive (cf. Lee 1984: 119f). This was generally\na lapse from the rigor of Aristotle\u2019s work, because the\narguments given to justify the laws of syllogism were of a poor\nstandard. Though al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does once briefly mention\nAristotle\u2019s counterexample method ([Syllogism]\n20.2\u20135), in practice he relies entirely on the laws of\nsyllogism. By contrast the earlier logic texts of Paul the Persian and\nIbn al-Muqaffa\u2018, both heirs of the Alexandrian view, copied\nAristotle\u2019s nonproductivity proofs in categorical logic with\ntotal formal rigor. \n\nFor further discussion of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s categorical\nsyllogisms, see Chatti and Hodges 2020 and Chatti 2019.\n6.2 Hypothetical Logic\n\nA hypothetical sentence consists of two shorter sentences joined\ntogether, as in the connected (mutta\u1e63il) form \u201cIf\np then q\u201d or the separated\n(munfa\u1e63il) form \u201cEither p or\nq\u201d. For the logic of these sentences,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b confines his attention almost entirely to\nsimple inferences like modus ponens:\n\n\nIf this visible thing is a human, then it is an animal; but it is a\nhuman. Therefore it is an animal.\n\n\nor an inference with exclusive disjunction:\n\n\nThis number is either even or odd; but it is even. Therefore it is not\nodd.\n\n\nHis treatment is so similar to the contents of Boethius\u2019 De\nSyllogismis Hypotheticis that they must have drawn on a common\nsource now lost. \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b points out that hypothetical sentences can be\nchained so as to form \u201ccompound syllogisms\u201d, as for\nexample in\n\n\nEither p or q. If p then not r. If not\nr then s. If s then t. Not t.\nTherefore q. \n\n\nThis formalizes an argument at his [Short Syllogism]\n90.6\u20139. He also gives examples of categorical syllogisms chained\ntogether\u2014though these can be found already in Aristotle. \n6.3 Modal Logic\n\nThere is almost no mention of modal syllogisms in any of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s surviving works. He must have\ndiscussed modal syllogisms in his [Commentary on Prior\nAnalytics]; but the relevant part of this work is lost and we\nhave to rely on citations by Avicenna, Averroes, and Maimonides. These\ncitations between them tell us of only one modal syllogistic mood that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b either accepted or\n rejected.[17]\n\nFrom [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 193.3\u201319 and\nquotations in Maimonides, we know that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nclaimed, against Galen, that logic with possibility statements is\nuseful in practical arts where actual outcomes have to be predicted,\nsuch as medicine, agriculture, and navigation (Schacht & Meyerhof\n1937: 67). This looks at first sight like a confusion between\npossibility and probability. But more likely al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nbelieved that the laws of modal logic could be tweaked so as to work\nwith \u201cProbably\u201d in place of a modal operator. In fact\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b does say at [Demonstration]\n44.20\u201322 that in many of the arts, \u201cNecessarily every\nA is a B\u201d and \u201cMost As are\nBs\u201d are treated as equivalent. (But wouldn\u2019t this\ncorrelate \u201cProbably\u201d with \u201cNecessarily\u201d rather\nthan \u201cPossibly\u201d? Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is not here to\nanswer the question.)\n\nThere is further evidence of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b experimenting\nwith other sentence forms in modal logic. Both Avicenna (Street 2001)\nand Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maq\u0101l\u0101t 102.13f) cite\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b as considering syllogistic premises\ncontaining \u201cinsofar as\u201d, for example, \u201cEvery\nA can be a B insofar as it is a B\u201d. \n\nFrom Averroes (Ibn Rushd, Maq\u0101l\u0101t 129.11\u201317)\nwe also know that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b observed that to get the\nsyllogism\n\n\nEvery C is a possible B. Every B is a possible\nA.\n\nTherefore every C is a possible A.\n\n\n(a form that Aristotle accepted as perfect) we need that \u201cEvery\nB\u201d in the second premise means \u201cEvery possible\nB\u201d; otherwise the Cs might be possible Bs\nbut not actual Bs, so that they would escape the quantifier of\nthe second premise, and hence violate the dictum de omni.\nFrom this al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b inferred that at least in this\nmodal syllogism, Aristotle intended \u2018Every B\u2019 to be read as\n\u2018Every possible B\u2019.\n\nExactly what al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b meant by the dictum de\nomni is hard to make out from Averroes\u2019 account. But\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s use of it seems to contain an attempt\nto give a set-theoretic justification of\n Barbara[18]\n in modal contexts. Another quotation from Averroes (Ibn Rushd,\nMaq\u0101l\u0101t 154.18f) shows al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nusing the dictum de omni (again presumably a set-theoretic\nargument) to justify a syllogism where the major premise has a\nnegative subject:\n\n\nA sculpture is not an animal. What is not an animal is not a\nhuman.\n\nTherefore a sculpture is not a human.\n\n\nThis is\n Celarent[19]\n but with the middle term made negative.\n6.4 Demonstrative Logic\n\nWe saw in\n Section 3\n above that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b believed Aristotle had prescribed\nuniversal rules for demonstrative reasoning in his Posterior\nAnalytics. But apart from some discussion of techniques for\nfinding definitions, the only rules that al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\noffers us in [Demonstration] are categorical syllogisms in\nmood Barbara with extra pieces clamped on. (These are in the\nsection [Demonstration] 33.1\u201339.4; they are quoted in\nStrobino 2019.)\n\nThis is disappointing, but at least it\u2019s clear where the extra\npieces come from. Demonstrative reasoning gives knowledge with\ncertainty, and in [Certainty] al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b writes\ndown some necessary and sufficient conditions for certainty. (These\n\u201cconditions of certainty\u201d are listed by\nL\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2020 and discussed by Black 2006.) The condition\nthat is relevant here is the last one:\n\n\nIf the previous conditions hold, it is not accidental that they\ndo.\n\n\n([Certainty] 100.18.) In other words they hold by reason of\nessence. Also in a discussion of demonstration in\n[Attainment] 51.15\u201352.17 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells\nus that demonstration must proceed from some primary concepts, and the\nconcepts in question are those that are answers to the questions\n\u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cby what\u201d, \u201chow\u201d,\n\u201cfrom what\u201d, and \u201cfor what\u201d. These are not\nexactly the questions listed in\n Section 4.2 above,\n but they are clearly in that territory. Again they indicate that a\ndemonstration should follow from the constitutive properties of the\nsubjects under discussion, i.e., from their essences. \n\nSuppose we have constitutive properties of A and B which\nbetween them ensure that every A is a B, and likewise\nconstitutive properties which ensure that every B is a\nC. Then by Barbara we know that every A is a\nC; but for demonstrative certainty we want \u201cEvery\nA is a C\u201d to be ensured by the constitutive\nproperties of A and C. Some of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s syllogisms confirm that this is so,\nconsidering different kinds of constitutive\n property.[20]\n In some other cases the constitutive properties fail to yield the\nrequired sentences, and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b comments that the\nsyllogism gives fact but not cause.\n\nGalston (1981) offers reasons for thinking that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b may have considered demonstrative proofs a\ndistant ideal, to be reached only after a substantial amount of work\nat the dialectical\n level.[21]\n7. Logical Consequence\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s most sophisticated definition of\nsyllogism is at [Expressions] 100.3\u20135: a syllogism\nis\n\n\nthings that are arranged in the mind in an order\n(tart\u012bb) such that when the things have been put in this\norder, the mind as a result finds itself unavoidably looking down at\nsomething else of which it was ignorant before, so that it knows it\nnow, and thus the mind is equipped to submit to the thing it looked\ndown at, just as if it [already] knew that thing.\n\n\nThe reference to \u201corder\u201d must owe something to\nAristotle\u2019s remark at Topics 156a22\u201326 that in a\ndebate, the questioner can sometimes hoodwink the responder by asking\nthe questions in the wrong order. But by bringing the notion of order\ninto the definition of syllogism itself, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nopens up a new chapter in logic (see Hodges 2018 on this and\nAvicenna\u2019s development of the theme). \n\nFor further illumination on al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nunderstanding of logical consequence, we need to explore what he says\nabout logical rules. At [Catalogue] 53.5\u20139 he tells\nus:\n\n\nThe art of logic provides in general the rules whose nature is to\nconstitute the intellect and to guide a person along the correct and\ntrue path in everything where there can be conceptual error, and the\nrules that protect and guard him against mistakes and slips and errors\nin concepts, and the rules through which one tests things in concepts\nwhere one can\u2019t be trusted not to make an error. \n\n\nBut these are Neoplatonic\n commonplaces.[22]\n Elsewhere al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b says deeper things about the rules\nof logic, as follows. \n\nRecall from\n Section 3\n above that on al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s understanding, the\ncorrect methods of logic were known by the time of Plato, who had them\n\u201caccording to matter\u201d, and it was Aristotle who\nreformulated them as \u201cuniversal rules\u201d. He very probably\nhas the same thing in mind when he says that Aristotle in Prior\nAnalytics considered declarative sentences \u201cfrom the point\nof view of their composition (ta\u2019l\u012bf) and not of\ntheir matter\u201d ([Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n53.3f). The point he is making here becomes clear if we go back to the\nexample syllogism spelled out at\n (*) in Section 5 above.\n This is actually al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s second shot at this\nsyllogistic mood. In his first shot ([Syllogism] 26.11f) he\nfollowed Aristotle\u2019s preferred style and used letters A,\nB, C in place of the \u201cmatters\u201d stone,\nanimal, and body respectively. So a corresponding paraphrase will\nread\n\n(**)\nFor all primary concepts A, B, and C, if a\nfirst sentence is taken as universal negative with subject A\nand predicate B, etc. etc.\n\n\nHere (**) is a universal rule in the sense that it is for all\nA, B, and C; the premises and conclusion contain\nno matter and are bare compositions. \n\nMallet (1994: 329\u2013335) calls attention to a passage in\n[Analysis] 95.5\u20138, where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b says\nhe will explain \u201chow we define syllogism\u201d and how it is\nused. \n\n\nFirstly, it is through knowledge of the topics, which are the\nuniversal premises whose particulars (juz\u2019iyy\u0101t)\nare used as major premises in a syllogism and in each separate art.\n\n\n\nIf \u201cparticulars\u201d means what it usually means in such a\ncontext, namely existentially quantified statements, then this is just\nwrong: existentially quantified statements are hardly ever major\npremises in syllogisms. But as Mallet points out, the passage makes\nsense if the \u201cuniversal premises\u201d are statements like (**)\nand their \u201cparticulars\u201d are corresponding statements of\nthe form\n (*).\n Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is then saying that natural language\nsyllogisms are validated through being instances of universal rules\nstating that all arguments of a certain form are valid. If this is a\ncorrect reading, it makes al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b a formal logician\nin a strong sense. And indeed some writers have written about\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s \u201cformalism\u201d (Zimmermann\n1981: xl).\n\nHowever, there are reasons for caution. As Mallet\u2019s paper shows,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b in his further discussion of topics, both in\n[Analysis] and in [Debate], heads off in completely\ndifferent directions (which are too complex to pursue here, but see\nHasnawi 2009 and Karimullah 2014). Moreover al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nhas a habit of justifying inferences by reference to real-world\ninformation about their terms (i.e., their matter) that is not\ncontained in the premises. He does this with the syllogistic mood\nBaroco ([Syllogism] 27.8\u201312, [Short\nSyllogism] 79.5\u201312), and there is a one-premise example at\n[Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n 136.10.[23]\n Elsewhere he plays fast and loose with the \u201cforms\u201d of\narguments, for example reducing a many-premise version of induction to\na two-premise categorical syllogism without giving any indication of\nhow a string of premises are reduced to a single one\n([Syllogism] 35.14\u201318). \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b often refers to \u201cuniversal\nrules\u201d. But they need not be laws that can be shown to hold\nwithout exceptions. Take for example his essay [Canons],\nwhich closes (272.16) with a statement that the work has presented\n\u201cuniversal rules\u201d of poetry. The work consists mostly of\nclassifications of different types of poetry, together with\ndefinitions of terms used in analyzing poetry, and a broad comparison\nwith decorative arts. These \u201crules\u201d are at best things\nthat a person who aspires to work on the theory of poetry ought to\nknow.\n\nIn any case the only kind of justification that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b offers for logical rules is that they have\nbeen found useful for certain purposes in the community that uses them\n(cf.\n Section 3 above).\n All in all, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b treats the formal rules of logic\nas heuristics rather than as laws of a scientific theory. A case can\nbe made for viewing al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b as one of the creators of\nwhat is now known as \u201cinformal logic\u201d, as in the texts of\nHitchcock (2017) and Walton (1989). The pivotal role that he gives to\ndialogue places him in the same world as Walton\u2019s book.\n8. Truth and Falsehood\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b defines a concept to be \u201ctrue\u201d\n(\u1e63\u0101diq) if it is the same\n(bi-\u2018aynihi) in the external world as it is in the soul\n([Letters] (88) 116.3f) For this definition to make sense,\nthe concept need not be propositional. For example ([Letters]\n118.5f), the concept \u201cvacuum\u201d is not true, because it\nexists only in the mind and not in the external world (Abed (1991:\n111\u2013115) discusses the relationship between existence and truth\nin al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b quite often uses the derived causative noun\nta\u1e63d\u012bq, which has a range of meanings between\n\u201cverification\u201d (i.e., gaining certainty that a thing is\ntrue) and \u201cassent\u201d (i.e., treating a thing as true).\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b expounds this distinction at\n[Demonstration] 20.4\u201321.12. He also points to the range\nof meanings of ta\u1e63d\u012bq at [Attainment]\n90.6f: it can occur \u201ceither through certain demonstration or\nthrough persuasion\u201d. Presumably the certain demonstration brings\nabout verification and the persuasion brings about assent.\n\nAt [Expressions] 86.17\u201387.4 al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ntells us that teaching has three steps:\n\u201cconceptualization\u201d (ta\u1e63awwur), where we\nunderstand what the concept is and what our teacher is telling us\nabout it; ta\u1e63d\u012bq; and \u201ccommitting to\nmemory\u201d\n (hif\u1e93).[24]\n [Demonstration] 80.22, in another passage on teaching, adds\nthat \u201cWe can seek ta\u1e63d\u012bq either of simple\nthings or of compound\u201d. For al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b a\nproposition is always compound, so he is telling us that\nnon-propositional concepts can be assented to.\n\nThe view that both propositions and non-propositional concepts can be\ntrue runs fairly deep in al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s thinking,\nalthough he recognizes that not everybody agrees with it\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 52.13f). For example,\nthis view allows him to think of definition of non-propositional\nconcepts and demonstration of propositions as overlapping procedures;\nthere can be definitions that are identical with demonstrations except\nin the order of their parts ([Demonstration]\n 47.11).[25]\n Avicenna a hundred years later found it essential to distinguish\nbetween non-propositional and propositional concepts. Provocatively he\nused al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own terminology of\nta\u1e63awwur and ta\u1e63d\u012bq to fix the\ndistinction; for Avicenna any concept can be conceptualized, but only\npropositions can go on to be\n verified.[26]\n\n\nA sentence can be switched between true and false by adding a negative\nparticle, for example, \u201cIt is not the case that\u201d\n(laysa). But it matters where the negative particle is put;\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b discusses a number of cases, ad hoc with no\nclear overall pattern. One case that he discusses in detail is where\nthe negation is attached to a noun, as when we form the noun\n\u201cnot-just\u201d from the noun \u201cjust\u201d. (Adjectives\nare counted as nouns.) Following Theophrastus (Fortenbaugh et al.\n1992: 148\u2013153) he identifies this kind of negation as\n\u201cmetathetic\u201d (\u2018ud\u016bl\u012b); he takes\nthe resulting metathetic sentence to be an affirmation, not a denial.\nNothing can be both just and not-just, but there are things that are\nneither, for example infants. So an infant is not just, but it is also\nnot not-just. For a similar reason the infant is not unjust. Also it\nis false that the infant is just, and false that it is not-just.\nLikewise it is false (rather than meaningless) that every heat is\ncurvilinear ([Categories] 125.8). (Thom 2008 steers a clear\npath through these notions.)\n\nBefore al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, metathesis seems to have played\nlittle or no role in rules of inference. So an example in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b with a metathetic subject term is worth\nnoting:\n\n\nIf every human is an animal, then every non-animal is a non-human.\n\n\nThis appears in his ([Analysis] 114.11f), where he introduces\nit as a topic. (Fallahi 2019 discusses this example.) \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b holds that \u201cCome here\u201d is neither\ntrue nor false, but \u201cYou must come here\u201d, which can be\nused in place of it (yaq\u016bmu maq\u0101ma(hu)), is true or\nfalse ([Short De Interpretatione] 47.3\u201348.1). The\nreason is that the first sentence, unlike the second, has the wrong\nshape to be true or false. He could be read as saying that every\ncommand has the same meaning as some indicative sentence, but truth\nand falsehood depend on the form of words used, not just on the\nmeaning. But closer inspection shows that he uses the phrase\nyaq\u016bmu maq\u0101ma for some quite weak equivalences\nwhere the two sentences in question definitely mean different things.\nFor example, he uses the phrase when a questioner in a debate asks a\nquestion with a metathetic affirmation in place of a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 136.6). His words for\ndifferent kinds of equivalence (for example, bi-manzila,\n\u201cin the same role as\u201d, which will be familiar to readers\nof Classical Arabic linguistics) deserve closer study. Having written\n[Expressions] and [Letters], he certainly deserves\nto have his prepositional phrases taken seriously.\n\nAt [Commentary on De Interpretatione] 89.12\u2013100.25\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b presents a distinctive view of statements\nabout the future (cf. Adamson 2006, Knuuttila 2020). In connection\nwith a future battle, the disjunction \u201cThe battle either will or\nwill not take place\u201d is a necessary proposition and hence true.\nBut since the future is indeterminate, neither of the sentences\n\u201cThe battle will take place\u201d and \u201cThe battle will\nnot take place\u201d is true; moreover the lapse of truth value is\nsomething intrinsic in the world, it is not just our ignorance.\nGranted, if Allah knows that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, then it is\ntrue now that Zayd will leave home tomorrow, and this implication is a\nnecessary truth. But the necessary truth of this implication\ndoesn\u2019t entail the necessary truth of its conclusion, and hence\nZayd still has the freedom to choose. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ndoesn\u2019t make clear whether he is doubting the modal\ninference\n\n\nNecessarily if p then q. Necessarily p. Therefore\nnecessarily q\n\n\nor whether he is allowing that there may be restrictions on what Allah\nnecessarily knows. (Hasnawi [1985: 28f] relates this passage to Muslim\ndebates about Allah\u2019s foreknowledge.)\n9. Foundations of Arabic\n\nIn several works al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b analyses features of Arabic\nas a language. Some of these works contain comparisons between Arabic\nand other languages: Greek, Syriac, Persian, and Sogdian in\n[Letters], Greek and Persian in [Commentary on De\nInterpretatione], and Greek in [Expressions].\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s comments on Greek include several\nmistranslations and dubious grammatical remarks, making it clear that\nhe didn\u2019t read Greek (for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nknowledge of languages see Zimmermann 1981: xlviif). Also\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has a strong tendency to classify languages\nas (1) Arabic and (2) \u201cother languages\u201d. So these\ncomparisons are far from being a serious contribution to comparative\nlinguistics, and one asks why he includes them. \n\nOn reading the comparisons, a pattern emerges.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b starts from a theory of the regime of\nconcepts (cf.\n Section 2\n above), and his chief concern is how well Arabic reflects this\nregime. The role of \u201cother languages\u201d is always to\nillustrate how other languages reflect the regime of concepts where\nArabic fails to do so. As Menn puts it, \u201cin practice, his\nreconstructed Greek serves as an ideal logical language, i.e.\na language in which grammatical form always tracks logical form\u201d\n(2008: 68).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s starting point is the concepts\nrequired for sentences that appear in categorical syllogisms, such\nas\n\n\nZayd is human. Every horse is animal. Some horse is not stone.\n\n\nHere \u201cZayd\u201d , \u201chorse\u201d, \u201canimal\u201d,\n\u201cstone\u201d signify simple primary concepts; the proper name\n\u201cZayd\u201d signifies a particular (juz\u2019), and\nthe other three words signify universals (kull\u012b).\n\u201cEvery\u201d and \u201csome\u201d are quantifiers\n(s\u016br), and \u201cis\u201d is a copula\n(r\u0101bi\u1e6d) signifying the connection between two\nprimary concepts so as to form an affirmation or a denial\n([Commentary on De Interpretatione] 102.17)\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b groups all these words into two classes: noun\n(ism) for those signifying primary concepts, and particle\n(\u1e25arf) for the remainder. (Adjectives count as nouns.)\nHe makes clear that the particles are a disparate group and need\nfurther classification ([Expressions] 42.8\u201312). \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b introduces a distinction between concepts\nthat apply to a thing permanently and those (called accident,\n\u2018ara\u1e0d) that apply only temporarily. As a result,\nconcepts have a temporal regime, and language should reflect this.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is at his most a priori here, claiming that\nthe temporal regime of concepts should be represented by a system of\nthree tenses: past, present, and future. We don\u2019t know whether\nhe simply failed to notice other ways in which time is represented in\nArabic grammar (for example, continuous tenses and pluperfect\nconstructions), or for some reason he dismissed these features as\nmarginal. \n\nBroadly following Aristotle, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b adds to noun and\nparticle a third class, namely verb (kalima). A verb\nsimultaneously expresses three pieces of meaning: a simple primary\nconcept, a copular linking, and a tense (and hence a time). Thus in\n\u201cZayd walked\u201d, the verb \u201cwalked\u201d expresses (i)\nthe primary concept \u201cwalking\u201d, (ii) a linking of this\nconcept to the concept of Zayd, and (iii) a past tense. \n\nIn spite of his blind spot about tenses,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s comments on verbs in Arabic contain\nsome of his best linguistic insights. For example, he notes that since\ntenses are needed only for talking about accidents, one should not\nexpect to find a verb whose primary concept is a permanent notion such\nas \u201chuman\u201d (ins\u0101n). He tests this by\nconstructing a verb from \u201chuman\u201d, namely\nta\u2019annasa. By the rules of Arabic, one would understand\nit to signify something with a temporal feature, namely\n\u201cbecoming a human\u201d ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 34.4\u20139). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b also\nuses a quite subtle linguistic argument to show that Arabic has a word\nthat can express pure tense without copula or primary concept. This is\nthe word k\u0101na, as in \u201cZayd was walking\u201d,\nzaydun k\u0101na yamsh\u012b. We can see that there is no\ncopula in k\u0101na, he tells us, because \u201cZayd is\nwalking\u201d, zaydun yamsh\u012b, already contains a copula\nin the verb yamsh\u012b ([Commentary on De\nInterpretatione] 42.6\u201318). We even find the beginnings of\nan analysis of the structure of events in\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s discussion of how the present tense\ncan signify either a point of time or an interval ([Commentary on\nDe Interpretatione] 40.3\u201341.18). \n10. Poetry and Music\n\nFor al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, music theory sits on the very edge of\nbeing a syllogistic art along with rhetoric and poetry:\n\n\n\u2026 it becomes clear that [the theoretical art of music] has much\nin common with that of the scholars in the linguistic arts from the\npeople of each tongue, and has much in common with the art of rhetoric\nand the art of poetry, both of which are parts of the art of logic in\nmany things. ([Music] 173)\n\n\nThe link to poetry is clear, he tells us, given that poetry is\nperfected by being set to music. Besides this there are formal\nsimilarities: poetry is formed by concatenating letters from a finite\nalphabet, and music is formed by concatenating sounds from a finite\npalette. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b grants that in the case of music the\npalette is dictated by nature, whereas the letters of a national\nalphabet are adopted by convention in that nation ([Music]\n120f). But he notes that in some cultures the music accompanying a\npoem is counted as a part of the poem, and that this can be justified\nby the fact that sometimes the poetic metre is sustained by the music\nrather than the words ([Poetry]\n 91.15\u201317).[27]\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b never considers music on its own as a\nsyllogistic art. There is an obvious reason for this, namely that\nmusic is not built of words, and syllogisms (by Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition which al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b cites at\n[Syllogism] 19.8) are a form of verbal discourse\n(qawl). But this requires only that the premises are verbal;\nthe conclusion, on both Aristotle\u2019s definition and\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own quoted in\n Section 7\n above, is simply a \u201cthing\u201d. Already in Aristotle the\nconclusion of a practical syllogism is an action, not a proposition.\n(Thus Aristotle, De Motu Animalium 7, 701a11: \u201cThe two\npropositions result in a conclusion which is an action\u201d.)\n\nIn what sense is it true that poetry contains words that compel assent\nto something that one didn\u2019t previously know?\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b discusses this question in three essays:\n[Canons], [Poetry], and [Proportion]. In\nall of them, part of his answer is that poetry excites our imagination\nand thereby persuades us to adopt certain attitudes. \n\nThis takes \u201csyllogism\u201d in a very weak sense. But in all\nthree works al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b also indicates that poetry\ncontains text that is \u201cpotentially\u201d a syllogism. His only\nexamples, in [Proportion] 505.22f, yield invalid categorical\nsyllogisms in second figure, as follows (see Aouad & Schoeler\n2002):\n\nThe person is beautiful. The sun is beautiful. Therefore the\nperson is a\n sun.[28]\nFire acts quickly. The sword acts quickly, viz. to kill. Therefore\nthe sword is a fire.\n\n\nHis point can be teased out in several different ways; the reader may\nhave better suggestions than ours. But here at least is a reading that\nmatches al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s text. Consider the following\nline of Ab\u016b Tamm\u0101m, in a poem written in 838 to celebrate a\nmilitary victory:\n\n\nKnowledge lies in the bright spears gleaming between two armies.\n(translated in Stetkevych 2002: 156) \n\n\nReading this in context, we realize that the poet is telling us that\nthe weapons gave certainty through a decisive victory. Knowledge is\nwhat gives certainty. So we can expand the text by what it brings to\nmind:\n\n\nThe spears give certainty. Knowledge gives certainty. Therefore the\nspears are knowledge.\n\n\nThis is not deductive reasoning. It\u2019s a verbalizing of thoughts\nthat the poem brings to our minds. Spelling it out, we are drawn to\nappreciate the fact that the battle resolved the situation. The text\nis an invalid syllogism in just the same way as\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s two examples above, but the fact that\nit is in second figure is really neither here nor there. \n\nNote that in this case the poem provides the conclusion, not the\npremises. So it fits Black\u2019s (1990: 226) description that\n\u201cWhat appears in the finished product is not a poetic syllogism\n\u2026 but only its conclusion\u201d. Are the hearers supposed to\nreconstruct the poet\u2019s premises by telepathy? Black leaves the\nproblem open, but in fact it\u2019s a problem we have met before. In\n[Syllogism] 19.10f al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tells us that\n\n\nA syllogism is just composed to reach a quaesitum which was\npreviously defined; the quaesitum was assumed first and one\nseeks to verify it by a syllogism.\n\n\nThis applies in various contexts, for example, when the questioner in\na debate has the task of finding a syllogism to refute the\nresponder\u2019s claim; \u201cthe enquiry is always about a\nquaesitum whose syllogism has not yet been found\u201d\n([Debate] 45.6). In the poetical case the hearers have the\ntask of finding a middle term that generates a poetic syllogism; in\nour example the middle term is \u201cgiving certainty\u201d. And\nagain, the premises yield the conclusion by imaginative suggestion,\nnot by deduction.\n\nThere remain some problems with al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\naccount of poetic syllogisms. First, he never says that only the\nconclusion appears in the poem. Black (1990: 235\u20138) suggests\nthat the practical syllogism might be a key to understanding other\ncases. \n\nSecond, why does al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b say in [Canons]\n268.15 that \u201cpoetic discourse is in all cases absolutely\nfalse\u201d? This is a gross exaggeration, and it raises the question\nwhether a poet can really expect the audience to assent to a pack of\nlies. It seems we can handle this problem.\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s statement in [Canons] is a\ntypical Neoplatonist soundbite, witness the Alexandrian Elias (In\nCategorias Prooemium 117.2\u20135):\n\n\nEither all the premises [of the syllogism] are true, making it\ndemonstrative, or they are all false and they make it poetic and\nmythic, or some are true and some are false \u2026. \n\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s own more mature view, in\n[Proportion] 506.3f, is that\n\n\nPoetry doesn\u2019t aim either to tell lies or not to tell them; its\naim and purpose is to arouse the imagination and the passion of the\nsoul. \n\n\nAnd even if some blatant lies do occur, we would surely admit (though\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b himself never quite says it in the texts that\nwe have) that a false statement may still contain poetic truth.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works of Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b", "Works of Other Authors"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works of Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[<em>Analysis</em>] <em>Kit\u0101b al-ta\u1e25l\u012bl</em>\n(<em>Analysis</em>), in [<em>Logic</em>] 2: 95\u2013129.", "[<em>Aristotle</em>] \u201cThe philosophy of Aristotle, the parts\nof his philosophy, the ranks of order of its parts, the position from\nwhich he started and the one he reached.\u201d Translated by Mohsin\nMahdi from an Arabic manuscript in Istanbul.
