    "main_text": "Fundamentals\n4. Fundamentals\nThe epistemic approach to game theory focuses on the choices\nof individual decision makers in specific informational\ncontexts, assessed on the basis of decision-theoretic choice\nrules. This is a bottom-up, as opposed to the classical top-down,\napproach. Early work in this paradigm include Bernheim (1984) and\nPearce\u2019s (1984) notion of rationalizability and\nAumann\u2019s derivation of correlated equilibrium from the\nminimal assumption that the players are \u201cBayesian\nrational\u201d (Aumann 1987).\nAn important line of research in epistemic game theory asks under\nwhat epistemic conditions will players follow the\nrecommendations of particular solution concept? Providing such\nconditions is known as an epistemic characterization of a\nsolution concept.\nIn this section, we present two fundamental epistemic\ncharacterization results. The first is a characterization of iterated\nremoval of strictly dominated strategies (henceforth ISDS), and the\nsecond is a characterization of backward induction. These epistemic\ncharacterization results are historically important. They mark the\nbeginning of epistemic game theory as we know it today. Furthermore,\nthey are also conceptually important. The developments in later\nsections build on the ideas presented in this section.\n",
