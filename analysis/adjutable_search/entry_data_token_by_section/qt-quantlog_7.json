    "main_text": "Interpretations of Quantum Logic || Operational Quantum Logic\n2.2 Operational Quantum Logic\n\nIf we put aside scruples about \u201cmeasurement\u201d as a\nprimitive term in physical theory, and accept a principled distinction\nbetween \u201ctestable\u201d and non-testable properties, then the\nfact that \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) is not Boolean is unremarkable, and\ncarries no implication about logic per se. Quantum mechanics\nis, on this view, a theory about the possible statistical\ndistributions of outcomes of certain measurements, and its\nnon-classical \u201clogic\u201d simply reflects the fact that not\nall observable phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Because of\nthis, the set of probability-bearing events (or propositions) is\nless rich than it would be in classical probability theory,\nand the set of possible statistical distributions, accordingly, less\ntightly constrained. That some \u201cnon-classical\u201d probability\ndistributions allowed by this theory are actually manifested in nature\nis perhaps surprising, but in no way requires any deep shift in our\nunderstanding of logic or, for that matter, of probability.\n\nThis is hardly the last word, however. Having accepted all of the\nabove, there still remains the question of why the logic of\nmeasurement outcomes should have the very special form\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\), and never anything more\n general.[7]\n This question entertains the idea that the formal structure of\nquantum mechanics may be uniquely determined by a small\nnumber of reasonable assumptions, together perhaps with certain\nmanifest regularities in the observed phenomena. This possibility is\nalready contemplated in von Neumann\u2019s Grundlagen (and\nalso his later work in continuous geometry), but first becomes\nexplicit\u2014and programmatic\u2014in the work of George Mackey\n[1957, 1963]. Mackey presents a sequence of six axioms, framing a very\nconservative generalized probability theory, that underwrite the\nconstruction of a \u201clogic\u201d of experimental propositions,\nor, in his terminology, \u201cquestions\u201d, having the structure\nof a sigma-orthomodular partially-ordered set (see Section 4 and the\nsupplement document\n The Basic Theory of Ordering Relations\n for definitions of these terms). The outstanding problem, for Mackey,\nwas to explain why this poset ought to be isomorphic to\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\):\n\nAlmost all modern quantum mechanics is based implicitly or explicitly\non the following assumption, which we shall state as an axiom:\n\n\nAxiom VII: The partially ordered set of all questions in quantum\nmechanics is isomorphic to the partially ordered set of all closed\nsubspaces of a separable, infinite dimensional Hilbert space.\n\n\nThis axiom has rather a different character from Axioms I through VI.\nThese all had some degree of physical naturalness and plausibility.\nAxiom VII seems entirely ad hoc. Why do we make it? Can we justify\nmaking it? \u2026 Ideally, one would like to have a list of\nphysically plausible assumptions from which one could deduce Axiom\nVII. Short of this one would like a list from which one could deduce a\nset of possibilities for the structure \u2026 all but one of which\ncould be shown to be inconsistent with suitably planned experiments.\n[Mackey 1963: 71\u201372]\n\n\nSince Mackey\u2019s writing there has grown up an extensive technical\nliterature exploring variations on his axiomatic framework in an\neffort to supply the missing assumptions. The remainder of this\narticle presents a brief survey of the current state of this\nproject.\n",
