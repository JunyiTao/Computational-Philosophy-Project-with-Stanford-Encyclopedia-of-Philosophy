    "main_text": "\n\n\nThere is a rough consensus in medical ethics on the requirement of\nrespect for patient\n autonomy:\nphysicians must ultimately defer to patients' own decisions about the\nmanagement of their medical care, so long as the patients are deemed to\nhave sufficient mental capacity to make the decisions in question. For\npatients who lack the relevant decision-making capacity at the time the\ndecision is to be made, a need arises for surrogate decision-making:\nsomeone else must be entrusted to decide on their behalf. Patients who\nformerly possessed the relevant decision-making capacity might have\nanticipated the loss of capacity and left instructions for how future\nmedical decisions ought to be made. Such instructions are called an\nadvance directive. One type of advance directive simply designates who\nthe surrogate decision-maker should be. A more substantive advance\ndirective, often called a living will, specifies particular principles\nor considerations meant to guide the surrogate's decisions in various\ncircumstances, for example, \u201cDo not prolong my life if I enter\npersistent vegetative state,\u201d or \u201cI am a fighter: do not\ndiscontinue life-sustaining treatment no matter what happens to\nme.\u201d\n\nThis general framework opens up a number of ethical issues. I shall set\naside here a foundational issue that is a subject of its own\nencyclopedia article: What are the criteria for\n decision-making capacity?\n These must be specified before we can establish, on any\ngiven occasion, whether there would be any need at all for\ndecision-making by a third party (with the aid of an advance directive\nor not). Assuming we have settled, using the appropriate criteria, that\nsurrogate decision-making is indeed called for, the following main\nissues arise:\n\n\nQ1. Who should be the surrogate decision-maker?\n\n \n Q2. On what basis should the surrogate make the decision? What\nconsiderations should she take into account? And, more\nspecifically,\n\n Q2a. Should the advance directive be honored?\n\n\n\nThis article focuses on philosophical contributions to the last two\nsets of questions.\n",
