We deliberate and\nmake choices, for instance, and in so doing we assume that there is\nmore than one choice we can make, more than one action we are able to\nperform. When we look back and regret a foolish choice, or blame\nourselves for not doing something we should have done, we assume that\nwe could have chosen and done otherwise. When we look forward and make\nplans for the future, we assume that we have at least some control\nover our actions and the course of our lives; we think it is at least\nsometimes up to us what we choose and try to do.\n\nDeterminism is a highly general claim about the universe: very\nroughly, that everything that happens, including everything you choose\nand do, is determined by facts about the past together with the laws.\nDeterminism isn\u2019t part of common sense, and it is not easy to\ntake seriously the thought that it might, for all we know, be true.\nThe incompatibilist believes that if determinism turned out to be\ntrue, our belief that we have free will would be false. The\ncompatibilist denies that the truth of determinism would have this\ndrastic consequence. According to the compatibilist, the truth of\ndeterminism is compatible with the truth of our belief that we have\nfree will. The philosophical problem of free will and determinism is\nthe problem of deciding who is right: the compatibilist or the\nincompatibilist.\n\nMuch of the philosophical interest in the free will/determinism\nproblem is motivated by concerns about moral responsibility because,\nit is generally agreed, having free will is a necessary condition of\nbeing morally responsible. So if determinism precludes free will, it\nalso precludes moral responsibility. But it\u2019s important to\ndistinguish questions about free will (whether we have it, what it\namounts to, whether it is compatible with determinism, whether it is\ncompatible with other things we believe true) from questions about\nmoral responsibility. Someone might believe that we have free will and\nthat free will is compatible with determinism while also believing,\nfor other reasons, that no one is ever morally responsible. And\nsomeone might believe that we don\u2019t have free will (because of\ndeterminism or something else) while also believing, against\nconventional wisdom, that we are nevertheless morally responsible.\nWhat one believes about determinism and moral responsibility will\ndepend, in large part, on what one believes about various matters\nwithin the scope of ethics rather than metaphysics. Among other\nthings, it will depend on what one takes moral responsibility to be\n(P. Strawson 1962; G. Strawson 1986, 1994; Scanlon 2008; Watson 1996,\n2004; Wolf 1990). For these reasons it is important not to conflate\nthe question of the compatibility of free will and determinism with\nthe question of whether moral responsibility is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that a change in definitions has crept into\nthe literature, and many contemporary theorists understand\n\u2018compatibilism\u2019 and \u2018incompatibilism\u2019 as\nclaims about moral responsibility (or \u201cmoral freedom\u201d or\nthe freedom that \u201cgrounds\u201d or \u201cexplains\u201d \u201cmoral\nresponsibility\u201d) rather than claims about free will (Pereboom\n1995, 2001, 2014. See Vihvelin 2011 for discussion). This entry will\nnot follow that usage.\n\nThis encyclopedia entry is about the free will/determinism problem;\nmore specifically, it is about arguments for the claim that free will\nis incompatible with determinism. Since so much of the contemporary\nfree will literature is dominated by concerns about moral\nresponsibility, some of the arguments considered will be arguments for\nthe thesis that if determinism is true, we are never morally\nresponsible because we never satisfy the \u201cfreedom\nrequirement\u201d for being morally responsible for our actions. But\nthe focus, in this entry, will be on the question of whether free will\n(or acting with free will) is compatible with determinism.\n", "toc": [{"#Prel": "1.

Preliminaries\n\nIn the literature, \u201cdeterminism\u201d is sometimes used as an\numbrella term for a variety of different claims which have\ntraditionally been regarded as threats to free will. Given this usage,\nthe thesis that we are calling \u201cdeterminism\u201d (nomological\ndeterminism, also sometimes called \u2018causal determinism\u2019)\nis just one of several different kinds of determinism, and the free\nwill/determinism problem we will be discussing is one of a family of\nrelated problems. For instance, logical determinism is the\nthesis that the principle of bivalence holds for all propositions,\nincluding propositions about the future, and the problem of free will\nand logical determinism is the problem of deciding whether our belief\nthat we have free will is compatible with the existence of truths\nabout all our future actions. (It should be noted that on this point\nthere is almost universal agreement among philosophers that the answer\nis \u201cyes\u201d.) For more on logical determinism, see the entry\non\n fatalism;\n Taylor 1962; D. Lewis 1976; Merricks 2009; Fischer & Todd 2011;\nVan Cleve 2019; Vihvelin 2013 and 2020. Theological\ndeterminism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge\nof all true propositions including propositions about our future\nactions; the problem of free will and theological determinism is the\nproblem of understanding how, if at all, we can have free will if God\n(who cannot be mistaken) knows what we are going to do. For\nmore on theological determinism, see the entries on\n fatalism\n and\n divine foreknowledge\n and Fischer & Todd 2015.\n\nIn this entry, we will be restricting our attention to arguments for\nthe incompatibility of free will and nomological determinism, but it\nis important to understand one preliminary point. Nomological and\nlogical determinism are very different kinds of claims. Logical\ndeterminism is a claim about truth; nomological determinism\nis a claim about the natural laws. Logical determinism\ndoesn\u2019t say anything about causation or the laws; it simply says\nthat, regardless of whether we ever come to know them or not, there\nare timelessly true propositions about the past, present, and future,\nincluding our future actions. Logical determinism doesn\u2019t entail\nnomological determinism; it might be true even if nomological\ndeterminism is false. But nomological determinism says (roughly) that\nfacts about the past together with facts about the laws determine all\nthe facts about the future. So if nomological determinism is true,\nthere are true propositions about all our future actions.\n\nWhy does this matter? For the following reason. A common first\nresponse to logical determinism is the fatalist\u2019s response:\n\nIf there are truths about what I will do in the future, then I\nmust do whatever I will do, and so I have no free\nwill.\n\nWhile this response has a powerful intuitive grip (as can be seen from\nmuch of the popular and even scientific discussion of time travel), it\nis generally agreed, by philosophers, that the fatalist is making a\nmistake. Different diagnoses have been given of the \u201cfatalist\nfallacy\u201d or other mistake in modal reasoning, but the basic\npoint is simple. Truth is not the same as necessity; it isn\u2019t\nthe same as logical necessity, metaphysical necessity, or even the\nrelative necessity of unavoidability or lack of ability or power. The\nexistence of a detailed set of truths about my future actions is\nconsistent with my ability to do things other than the things I\nactually do.\n\nIt is of course possible to agree that the existence of\ntruths about all our future actions is compatible with free\nwill while denying that the existence of nomologically\ndetermined truths about all our future actions is compatible with\nfree will. But an argument is needed for this conclusion, an argument\nwhich doesn\u2019t rely on fatalist reasoning or an appeal to\nfatalist intuitions.\n\nFor comparisons between arguments for incompatibilism and arguments\nfor fatalism, see van Inwagen 1983, Mackie 2003, Perry 2004, and\nVihvelin 2008 and 2013.\n\nAt a first approximation, nomological determinism (henceforth\n\u201cdeterminism\u201d), is a contingent and empirical claim about\nthe laws of nature: that they are deterministic rather than\nprobabilistic, and that they are all-encompassing rather than limited\nin scope. At a second approximation, laws are deterministic if they\nentail exceptionless regularities (e.g., that all \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\)s,\nthat all \\(ABCD\\)s are \\(E\\)s) and laws are probabilistic if they say\nthat \\(F\\)s have an objective chance \\(N\\) (less than 1) of being\n\\(G\\)s (note that so-called \u201cstatistical laws\u201d need not be\nprobabilistic laws; see Armstrong 1983, Loewer 1996a). The laws of\nnature are all-encompassing if deterministic or probabilistic laws\napply to everything in the universe, without any exceptions. If, on\nthe other hand, some individuals or some parts of some individuals\n(e.g., the nonphysical minds of human beings) or some of the behaviors\nof some of the individuals (e.g., the free actions of human beings) do\nnot fall under either deterministic or probabilistic laws, then the\nlaws are limited rather than all-encompassing.\n\nFor a more precise articulation of determinism, the contemporary\nliterature offers us two main choices.\n\nDeterminism is standardly defined in terms of entailment, along these\nlines: A complete description of the state of the world at any time\ntogether with a complete specification of the laws entails a complete\ndescription of the state of the world at any other time. (Hoefer 2002,\nMele 2009, Beebee 2013; see also van Inwagen 1983, Ginet 1990, and the\nEncyclopedia entry on\n causal determinism).\n\nAlternatively, following D. Lewis 1973, we might understand\ndeterminism as the thesis that our world is governed by a set of\nnatural laws which is such that any two possible worlds with our\nlaws which are exactly alike at any time are also exactly alike\nat every other time (see also Earman 1986). This second definition of\ndeterminism is stronger than the first; if a possible world is\ndeterministic according to the Lewis/Earman definition, it is\ndeterministic according to the Entailment definition, but not vice\nversa.\n\nLet\u2019s call a possible world \u2018deterministic\u2019 iff the\nthesis of determinism is true at that world;\n\u2018non-deterministic\u2019 iff the thesis of determinism is false\nat that world. There are two very different ways in which a world\nmight be non-deterministic. A world might be non-deterministic because\nat least some of its fundamental laws are probabilistic, or a world\nmight be non-deterministic because it has no laws or because its laws\nare not all-encompassing. Let\u2019s call worlds which are\nnon-deterministic in only the first way \u2018probabilistic\nworlds\u2019 and let\u2019s call worlds which are non-deterministic\nin the second way \u2018lawless\u2019 or \u2018partly\nlawless\u2019 worlds.\n\nDeterminism is a thesis about the statements or propositions that are\nthe laws of our world; it says nothing about whether these statements\nor propositions are knowable by finite beings, let alone whether they\ncould, even in principle, be used to predict all future events. (For\nmore on the relation between determinism and predictability, see the\nEncyclopedia entry on\n Causal Determinism.)\n\nDeterminism, understood according to either of the two definitions\nabove, is neutral with respect to different philosophical accounts of\nlawhood, ranging from the so-called \u201cna\u00efve\nregularity\u201d account (Swartz 1986) to broadly Humean or\n\u201cbest system\u201d accounts (D. Lewis 1973; Earman 1986; Loewer\n1996a; Beebee 2000; Schaffer 2008) to various kinds of necessitarian\naccounts (Armstrong 1983; Carroll 2008). In the book that set the\nstage for much of the contemporary discussion of the free\nwill/determinism problem, van Inwagen 1983 appealed only to two\nrelatively uncontroversial assumptions about the laws of nature: that\nthe propositions that are laws have this status independent of the\nhistory or present state of scientific knowledge and that the laws\nimpose limits on our abilities. Most of the participants in the\ncurrent debate agree, but there are dissenters who think that\ndeterminism must be defined in a metaphysically stronger way, as a\nkind of necessitation relation between particular events (Mumford\n& Anjum 2014). For critique, see Mackie 2014a and Franklin\n2014.\n\nDeterminism (understood according to either of the two definitions\nabove) is not a thesis about causation; it is not the thesis that\ncausation is always a relation between events, and it is not the\nthesis that every event has a cause. If the fundamental laws turn out\nto be probabilistic rather than deterministic, this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat there is no causation; it just means that we have to revise our\ntheories of causation to fit the facts. And this is what philosophers\nof causation have done; there are probabilistic versions of lawful\nentailment theories of causation, of counterfactual theories of\ncausation, and so on, for all major theories of causation (see the\nentries on the\n metaphysics of causation\n and\n counterfactual theories of causation).\n It is now generally accepted that it might be true that every event\nhas a cause even if determinism is false and thus some events lack\nsufficient causes.\n\nMore controversially, it might be true that every event has a cause\neven if our world is neither deterministic nor probabilistic. If there\ncan be causes without laws (if a particular event, object, or person\ncan be a cause, for instance, without instantiating a law), then it\nmight be true, even at a lawless or partly lawless world, that every\nevent has a cause (Anscombe 1981; van Inwagen 1983).\n\nIt\u2019s less clear whether determinism entails the thesis that\nevery event has a cause. Whether it does depends on what the correct\ntheory of causation is; in particular, it depends on what the correct\ntheory says about the relation between causation and law.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that we should not make the\nassumption, almost universally made in the older literature, that the\nthesis that every event has a cause is equivalent to the thesis of\ndeterminism. This is an important point, because some of the older\narguments in the literature against incompatibilism assume\nthat the two claims are equivalent (Hobart 1934).\n\nIn the older literature, it was assumed that determinism is the\nworking hypothesis of science, and that to reject determinism is to be\nagainst science. This no longer seems plausible. Some people think\nthat quantum physics has shown determinism to be false. This remains\ncontroversial (Albert 1992; Loewer 1996b; P. Lewis 2016), but it is\nnow generally agreed that we can reject determinism without accepting\nthe view that the behavior of human beings falls outside the scope of\nnatural laws. If naturalism is the thesis that human behavior can be\nexplained in the same kind of way\u2014in terms of events, natural\nprocesses, and laws of nature\u2014as everything else in the\nuniverse, then we can reject determinism without rejecting\nnaturalism.\n\nNote, finally, that determinism neither entails physicalism nor is\nentailed by it. There are possible worlds where determinism is true\nand physicalism false; e.g., worlds where minds are nonphysical things\nwhich nevertheless obey deterministic laws (van Inwagen 1998). And\nthere are possible worlds (perhaps our own) where physicalism is true\nand determinism is false.\n\nSo much for determinism. What about free will? How should we\nunderstand the disagreement between the compatibilist and the\nincompatibilist?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of room for argument about how, exactly, we should\nunderstand our commonsense beliefs about ourselves as persons with\nfree will. (Are we born with free will? If not, when do we acquire it,\nand in virtue of what abilities or powers do we have it? What is the\ndifference between acting intentionally and acting with free will?)\nLuckily we don\u2019t have to answer these questions in order to say\nwhat is at issue between the compatibilist and the incompatibilist.\nLet\u2019s define the free will thesis as the thesis that at\nleast one non-godlike (human-like) creature has free will, leaving it\nopen what that amounts to. The free will thesis is a minimal\nclaim about free will; it would be true if one person in the universe\nacted with free will (acted freely, acted while possessing free will)\non one occasion. We won\u2019t assume that the free will thesis is\ntrue or even possibly true, but let a free will world be any\npossible world where the free will thesis is true. Since\nnon-determinism is the negation of determinism, and since determinism\nis a contingent thesis, we can divide the set of possible worlds into\ntwo non-overlapping subsets: deterministic worlds and\nnon-deterministic worlds.\n\nGiven this apparatus, we could define incompatibilism and\ncompatibilism in the following way: incompatibilism is the thesis that\nno deterministic world is a free will world. (Equivalently,\nincompatibilism is the claim that necessarily, if determinism is true,\nthen the free will thesis is false.) And we could define compatibilism\nas the denial of incompatibilism; that is, as the claim that some\ndeterministic worlds are free will worlds. (Equivalently,\ncompatibilism is the claim that possibly, determinism and the free\nwill thesis are both true.)\n\nThis way of defining compatibilism is unproblematic. There are\ncompatibilists who are agnostic about the truth or falsity of\ndeterminism, so a compatibilist need not be a soft determinist\n(someone who believes that it is in fact the case that determinism is\ntrue and we have free will). And a compatibilist might believe that we\ndon\u2019t have free will for reasons independent of determinism. But\nall compatibilists believe that it is at least possible that\ndeterminism is true and we have free will. So all compatibilists are\ncommitted to the claim that there are deterministic worlds that are\nfree will worlds.\n\nBut this definition of incompatibilism has a surprising consequence.\nSuppose, as some philosophers have argued, that we lack free will\nbecause free will is conceptually or metaphysically impossible, at\nleast for nongodlike creatures like us (Taylor 1962; G. Strawson 1986,\n1994). If these philosophers are right, there are no free will worlds.\nAnd if there are no free will worlds, it follows that there are no\ndeterministic free will worlds. So if free will is\nconceptually or metaphysically impossible, at least for creatures like\nus, it follows that incompatibilism (as we have just defined it) is\ntrue. But this doesn\u2019t seem right. If it is conceptually or\nmetaphysically impossible for us to have free will, then we lack free\nwill regardless of whether determinism is true or false. And\nif that is so, then the incompatibilist cannot say the kind of things\nshe has traditionally wanted to say: that the truth or falsity of\ndeterminism is relevant to the question of whether or not we\nhave free will, that if determinism were true, then we would lack free\nwill because determinism is true, and so on.\n\nIf we want to avoid this counter-intuitive result, there is a remedy.\nInstead of understanding compatibilism and incompatibilism as\npropositions that are contradictories, we can understand them as\npropositions that are contraries. That is, we can understand\ncompatibilism and incompatibilism as claims that can\u2019t both be\ntrue, but that can both be false. Compatibilism and incompatibilism\nare both false if a third claim, impossibilism, is true. Impossibilism\nis the thesis that free will is conceptually or metaphysically\nimpossible for non-godlike creatures like us.\n\nIf we accept this three-fold classification, we can define our terms\nas follows: Impossibilism is the thesis that there are no free will\nworlds. Incompatibilism is the thesis that there are free will worlds\nbut no deterministic world is a free will world. Compatibilism is the\nthesis that there are free will worlds and free will worlds include\ndeterministic worlds. (For some objections to this three-fold\nclassification see McKenna 2010 and Mickelson 2015a. For defense, see\nVihvelin 2008 and 2013.)\n\nThe term \u2018impossibilism\u2019 is being coined; however, the\nposition it describes is recognized in the literature under a variety\nof names: the \u201cno free will either way\u201d view,\n\u201cnon-realism\u201d, \u201cillusionism\u201d,\n\u201cpessimism\u201d. Theorists who defend impossibilism include G.\nStrawson 1986 and 1994, and Smilansky 2000. Another kind of\nimpossibilist is the fatalist (Taylor 1962).\n\nIn the older literature, there were just two kinds of\nincompatibilists\u2014hard determinists and libertarians. A hard\ndeterminist is an incompatibilist who believes that determinism is in\nfact true (or, perhaps, that it is close enough to being true so far\nas we are concerned, in the ways relevant to free will) and because of\nthis we lack free will (Holbach 1770; Wegner 2003). A libertarian is\nan incompatibilist who believes that we in fact have free will and\nthis entails that determinism is false, in the right kind of way (van\nInwagen 1983). Traditionally, libertarians have believed that\n\u201cthe right kind of way\u201d requires that agents have a\nspecial and mysterious causal power not had by anything else in\nnature: a godlike power to be an uncaused cause of changes in the\nworld (Chisholm 1964). Libertarians who hold this view are committed,\nit seems, to the claim that free will is possible only at worlds that\nare at least partly lawless, and that our world is such a world (but\nsee O\u2019Connor 2000, Clarke 2003 and Steward 2012). But in the\ncontemporary literature there are incompatibilists who avoid such\nrisky metaphysical claims by arguing that free will is possible at\nworlds where some of our actions have indeterministic event causes\n(Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a; Ekstrom 2000; Balaguer 2010; Franklin\n2018) or that free will is possible at worlds where some of our\nactions are uncaused (Ginet 1990). Note that none of these three kinds\nof incompatibilists (agent-causation theorists, indeterministic\nevent-causation theorists, non-causal theorists) need be libertarians.\nThey may reserve judgment about the truth or falsity of determinism\nand therefore reserve judgment about whether or not we in fact have\nfree will. They might also be hard determinists because they believe\nthat determinism is in fact true. But what they do believe\u2014what\nmakes them incompatibilists\u2014is that it is possible for\nus to have free will and that our having free will depends on a\ncontingent fact about the laws that govern the\nuniverse: that they are indeterministic in the right kind of way. (See\nthe entry on\n incompatibilist theories of free will).\n\nGiven these definitions and distinctions, we can now take the first\nstep towards clarifying the disagreement between compatibilists and\nincompatibilists. Both sides agree that it is conceptually and\nmetaphysically possible for us to have free will; their disagreement\nis about whether any of the possible worlds where we have free will\nare deterministic worlds. The compatibilist says \u2018yes\u2019;\nthe incompatibilist says \u2018no\u2019. Arguments for\nincompatibilism must, then, be arguments for the claim that\nnecessarily, if determinism is true, we lack the free will we might\notherwise have.\n2. Two Reasons for Thinking that Free Will is Incompatible with Determinism\n\nA common first response to determinism is to think that it means that\nour choices make no difference to anything that happens\nbecause earlier causes have pre-determined or \u201cfixed\u201d our\nentire future (Nahmias 2011). It is easy to think that determinism\nimplies that we have a destiny or fate that we cannot avoid, no matter\nwhat we choose or decide and no matter how hard we try.\n\n\nMan, when running over, frequently without his own knowledge,\nfrequently in spite of himself, the route which nature has marked out\nfor him, resembles a swimmer who is obliged to follow the current that\ncarries him along; he believes himself a free agent because he\nsometimes consents, sometimes does not consent, to glide with the\nstream, which, notwithstanding, always hurries him forward. (Holbach\n1770 [2002]: 181; see also Wegner 2003)\n\n\nIt is widely agreed, by incompatibilists as well as compatibilists,\nthat this is a mistake. Empirical discoveries about our brain and\nbehavior might tell us that we don\u2019t have as much conscious\ncontrol as we think we have (Wegner 2003; Libet 1999). (For critique\nof arguments claiming that recent scientific research has shown that\n\u201cconscious will is an illusion\u201d, see Mele 2009, some of\nthe essays in Sinnott-Armstrong & Nadel 2011, Mele 2015, and\nRoskies & Nahmias 2016.) And there are worries, arising from\ncertain versions of physicalism, that our mental states don\u2019t\nhave the causal powers we think they have (Kim 1998). But these\nthreats to free will have nothing to do with determinism. Determinism\nmight imply that our choices and efforts have earlier sufficient\ncauses; it does not imply that we don\u2019t make choices or that our\nchoices and efforts are causally impotent. Determinism is consistent\nwith the fact that our deliberation, choices and efforts are part of\nthe causal process whereby our bodies move and cause further effects\nin the world. And a cause is the kind of thing that \u201cmakes a\ndifference\u201d (Sartorio 2005, Menzies 2017, List 2019). If I raise\nmy hand because I chose to do so, then it\u2019s true, ceteris\nparibus, that if my choice had not occurred, my hand-raising\nwould not have occurred.\n\nPutting aside this worry, we may classify arguments for\nincompatibilism as falling into one of two main varieties:\n\nArguments for the claim that determinism would make it impossible\nfor us to cause and control our actions in the right kind of\nway.\nArguments for the claim that determinism would deprive us of the\npower or ability to do or choose otherwise.\n\n\nArguments of the first kind focus on the notions of self, causation,\nand responsibility; the worry is that determinism rules out the kind\nof causation that we invoke when we attribute actions to persons\n(\u201cIt was Suzy who broke the vase\u201d) and make judgments of\nmoral responsibility (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t her fault; Billy pushed\nher\u201d). Someone who argues for incompatibilism in this way may\nconcede that the truth of determinism is consistent with the causal\nefficacy of our deliberation, choices, and attempts to act. But, she\ninsists, determinism implies that the only sense in which we\nare responsible for what we do is the sense in which a dog or young\nchild is responsible. Moral responsibility requires something more\nthan this, she believes. Moral responsibility requires autonomy or\nself-determination: that our actions are caused and controlled by, and\nonly by, our selves. To use a slogan popular in the\nliterature: We act freely and are morally responsible only if\nwe are the ultimate source of our actions.\n\n\nEach of us, when we act, is a prime mover unmoved. In doing what we\ndo, we cause certain events to happen, and nothing\u2014or no\none\u2014causes us to cause these events to happen. (Chisholm 1964:\n32)\n\nFree will\u2026is the power of agents to be the ultimate creators or\noriginators and sustainers of their own ends or purposes\u2026when\nwe trace the causal or explanatory chains of action back to their\nsources in the purposes of free agents, these causal chains must come\nto an end or terminate in the willings (choices, decisions, or\nefforts) of the agents, which cause or bring about their purposes.\n(Kane 1996: 4)\n\n\nArguments of the second kind focus on the notion of choice. To have a\nchoice, it seems, is to have genuine options or\nalternatives\u2014different ways in which we can act. The worry is\nthat determinism entails that what we do is, always, the only\nthing we can do, and that because of this we never really\nhave a choice about anything, as opposed to being under the\n(perhaps inescapable) illusion that we have a choice. Someone who\nargues for incompatibilism in this way may concede that the truth of\ndeterminism is consistent with our making choices, at least in the\nsense in which a dog or young child makes choices, and consistent also\nwith our choices being causally effective. But, she insists, this is\nnot enough for free will; we have free will only if we have a genuine\nchoice about what actions we perform, and we have a genuine choice\nonly if there is more than one action we are able to\nperform.\n\n\nA person has free will if he is often in positions like these: he must\nnow speak or be silent, and he can now speak and can\nnow remain silent; he must attempt to rescue a drowning child or else\ngo for help, and he is able to attempt to rescue the child\nand able to go for help; he must now resign his chairmanship\nor else lie to the members; and he has it within his power to resign\nand he has it within his power to lie. (van Inwagen 1983: 8)\n\n\nvan Inwagen is giving what he takes to be uncontroversial examples of\npersons who have free will; he isn\u2019t saying that free will just\nis the ability to perform more than one overt action. Our\nchoices include choices among purely mental actions (to pay attention\nto a lecture or to spend the time deciding what to cook for dinner) as\nwell as choices about the actions we perform by moving our bodies. If\nthe incompatibilist claims that determinism robs us of free will by\nrobbing us of choice, this must be understood as the claim that\ndeterminism has the consequence that we are never able to do\nanything other than what we actually do, where\n\u201cdo\u201d includes deciding, choosing, and other instances of\nmental agency as well as the things we do by moving our bodies.\n\nWe might question whether arguments based on self-determination and\narguments based on choice are independent ways of arguing for\nincompatibilism for the following reason: I cause and control my\nactions in the self-determining way required for moral responsibility\nonly if my actions are the product of my free will and my actions are\nthe product of my free will only if I have the ability to do (choose\nto do, decide to do, intend to do, try to do) otherwise. If\ndeterminism has the consequence that I never have the ability\nto do otherwise, it also has the consequence that I never cause my\nactions in the self-determining way required for moral responsibility\n(Kane 1996).\n\nAt one time, this link between moral responsibility,\nself-determination, and the ability to do otherwise was common ground\nbetween compatibilists and incompatibilists. That is, everyone agreed\nthat a person is morally responsible only if she has the right kind of\ncontrol over what she does, and everyone assumed that a\nperson has the right kind of control over something she does only if\nshe is able to do (or at least decide, choose, intend, or try)\notherwise. Given this assumption, anyone hoping to defend the\nclaim that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism had to\nfirst show that the ability to do otherwise is compatible with\ndeterminism. During the heyday of ordinary language philosophy in the\nmiddle years of the last century, there was a further assumption: that\nthe ability to do otherwise is compatible with determinism only if\nsentences like \u201c\\(S\\) could have done \\(X\\)\u201d (where \\(X\\)\nis something \\(S\\) did not do) were equivalent in meaning to\ncounterfactual conditionals like \u201cif \\(S\\) had chosen (or tried,\nwanted, preferred, etc.) to do \\(X\\), \\(S\\) would have done\n\\(X\\)\u201d. This debate was crippled by the fact that it took place\nat a time when counterfactuals were still poorly understood, before\nthe advent of the Lewis-Stalnaker possible worlds semantics (D. Lewis\n1973). There were counterexamples to the analyses proposed, and there\nwas a growing consensus that the prospects for a successful\n\u201cConditional Analysis\u201d were dim (Austin 1956; Chisholm\n1964; Lehrer 1968 and 1976). (For an argument that this pessimism was\npremature, see Vihvelin 2004 and 2013. For an argument that a\ncompatibilist doesn\u2019t need to defend a Conditional Analysis, see\nLehrer 1976.)\n\nIt was against this background that Harry Frankfurt proposed his\nfamous counterexample to the \u201cPrinciple of Alternate\nPossibilities\u201d (a person is morally responsible for what he has\ndone only if he could have done otherwise). Frankfurt wanted to defend\nthe claim that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism\nwithout having to defend the claim that the ability to do otherwise is\ncompatible with determinism. His strategy took the form of an\ningenious thought experiment that was supposed to show that no matter\nhow you understand ability to do otherwise\u2014whether you are a\ncompatibilist or an incompatibilist\u2014you should agree that the\npossession of this ability is not a necessary condition of being\nmorally responsible (Frankfurt 1969).\n\nThere were two steps to the thought experiment. In the first step he\ninvited you to imagine a person, Jones, who has free will, and who\nacts freely and who satisfies all the conditions you think necessary\nand sufficient for moral responsibility. You may imagine Jones in one\nof the scenarios van Inwagen describes, faced with a choice to speak\nor be silent, to try to rescue the child or go for help, to resign his\nchairmanship or to lie, and to imagine that Jones deliberates and\ndecides, for his own reasons, in favor of one of his contemplated\nalternatives, and then successfully acts on his decision. In the\nsecond step you are invited to add to the story the existence of a\npowerful being, Black, who takes a great interest in what Jones does,\nincluding how he deliberates and decides. You may fill in the details\nhowever you like, but you must imagine that Black has the power to\ninterfere with Jones in a way that ensures that Jones does\nexactly what Black wants him to do. And you must also imagine\nthat Black is paying very close attention and is prepared to intervene\ninstantly, should it be necessary, to stop Jones from doing something\nBlack doesn\u2019t want him to do. But, as it turns out, it\nwasn\u2019t necessary. By lucky co-incidence, Jones did exactly what\nBlack wanted him to do. (He even deliberated and decided the way Black\nwanted him to deliberate and decide.) So Black remained on the\nsidelines and only watched.\n\nBecause Black never laid a finger on Jones, or interfered in any way,\nit seems that Jones is as morally responsible in the second step of\nthe story as he is in the first step. But it also seems that the\nexistence of the powerful Black suffices to make it the case that\nJones is unable to do otherwise (or, as Frankfurt put it, that he\nlacks \u201calternate possibilities\u201d.)\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s story has strong intuitive force, and many were\nconvinced that it shows that we were mistaken when we thought that a\nperson has the right kind of control over what she does\u2014the kind\nof control that is necessary for moral responsibility\u2014only if\nshe is able to do otherwise. These philosophers, who later became\nknown as \u201cSource\u201d compatibilists or\n\u201csemi-compatibilists\u201d, took the moral to be that it is not\nrelevant, so far as moral responsibility is concerned,\nwhether determinism has the consequence that we don\u2019t have the\nfree will we think we have, that we never have any genuine choices,\nthat we are never able to do otherwise. They said that what matters,\nso far as moral responsibility is concerned, is only what happens in\nthe \u201cactual sequence\u201d (Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza\n1998; Sartorio 2016).\n\nBut a little reflection should make us wonder whether facts about the\n\u201cactual sequence\u201d can come apart from facts about free\nwill in the way envisaged by Frankfurt. How can it be true that Black\nsucceeds, not just in limiting the range of Jones\u2019\nalternative courses of action, but in making it the case that Jones\nhas no alternatives? How can Black, sitting on the sidelines,\ndeprive Jones of the ability to deliberate, decide, or try\notherwise?\n\nWe can easily grant that Black has the power to directly manipulate\nJones\u2019 body so Jones loses the ability to move his body in any\nway other than the ways that Black wants. We might even grant that\nBlack has the power to directly manipulate Jones\u2019 mind/brain, so\nJones loses the ability to \u201cmove\u201d his mind in any way\nother than the ways that Black wants. But Black never exercises his\npower. There is a difference between the existence of a power\nand the exercise of a power. It is a modal fallacy to reason\nfrom \u201cBlack has the power to bring it about that Jones lacks the\nability to do otherwise\u201d to \u201cJones lacks the ability to do\notherwise\u201d. The truth about Jones is not that Black robs him of\nthe ability to do otherwise; it is the more complicated truth that\nBlack puts him at constant risk of losing the ability to do\notherwise. Jones\u2019 free will and his moral responsibility are\ndependent on the luck of his deliberations and intentions\nco-coinciding with those of Black (Vihvelin 2013; for some other\ncriticisms of Frankfurt\u2019s argument see Lamb 1993, Alvarez 2009,\nand Steward 2009).\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument has been enormously influential, though\nperhaps not in the way he intended. His thought experiment was a\nfailure; while most compatibilists were convinced, most\nincompatibilists were not. (Compatibilists who were not convinced\ninclude Smith 1997, 2004; Campbell 2005; Fara 2008; Vihvelin 2000 and\n2013.) These incompatibilists insisted, though not for the reason\ngiven above, that Black does not succeed in robbing Jones of all his\nfreedom; there is something that remains up to Jones\n(Widerker 1995; Ginet 1996; Kane 1996). This response, famously dubbed\nthe \u201cflickers of freedom\u201d reply, was criticized by\ndefenders of Frankfurt\u2019s argument on the ground that the\n\u201calternative possibilities\u201d retained by Jones are not\nsufficiently \u201crobust\u201d (Fischer 1994, 2003; Fischer &\nRavizza 1998). The critics of the argument rejected this charge,\narguing that Jones retains a morally relevant ability to do otherwise,\nthus resurrecting the very debate that Frankfurt had hoped to\nundermine. Other defenders of Frankfurt\u2019s argument told more\ncomplicated stories and argued that, even if Frankfurt\u2019s story\ndoes not succeed, these new stories show that a person may be morally\nresponsible for her action despite lacking any ability to do\notherwise (Mele & Robb 1998; Pereboom 2003). More than fifty years\nafter the publication of Frankfurt\u2019s article, the debate\ncontinues. For a sample of some of this vast literature, see Widerker\n& McKenna 2003.\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s aim was to make it easier to defend the claim that\nmoral responsibility is compatible with determinism and there\nis a case to be made that he was successful or, at least, successful\nagainst the \u201cSource\u201d incompatibilists who were convinced\nby his argument (Fischer 2003, Sartorio 2016). But there has been a\ncost. Our interest in free will is not limited to our interest in\nmoral responsibility. Compatibilism has historically been charged with\nbeing \u201ca wretched subterfuge\u201d and a \u201cquagmire of\nevasion\u201d. Determinism seems prima facie incompatible with\ngenuine choice and the ability to do otherwise, and while there was a\ntime when the philosophical consensus was that the incompatibilist is\nguilty of some simple confusion or mistake akin to the\nfatalist\u2019s mistake, this is no longer the case, thanks to the\nConsequence argument (to be discussed later). The influence of\nFrankfurt\u2019s argument (and his other essays, especially Frankfurt\n1971) has been so great that most compatibilists have turned their\nattention away from the free will/determinism problem and focused\nexclusively on problems about moral responsibility (and related\ntopics, like blame, desert, and punishment). The term\n\u2018compatibilism\u2019 is now often used to refer to a thesis\nabout moral responsibility\u2014that the freedom sufficient for moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism (Pereboom 1995), that\nthe existence of actions free in the sense required for moral\nresponsibility is compatible with determinism (Markosian 1999), that\nthe unique ability of persons to exercise control in the manner\nnecessary for moral responsibility is compatible with determinism\n(McKenna 2004b [2015]). The literature on the traditional problem of\nfree will and determinism is dominated by incompatibilists. There is a\ngrowing consensus that the incompatibilist is right: if our universe\nis a deterministic one, we never have the ability to choose and do\nanything other than what we actually do.\n\nBefore we ask whether this pessimism about the compatibility of free\nwill with determinism is warranted, we should pause to ask whether\nthere really is a substantive disagreement between compatibilists and\nincompatibilists. When an incompatibilist says that determinism would\nrob us of the free will we think we have, including genuine choices\nand the ability to do otherwise, and when the compatibilist denies\nthis, are they asserting and denying the same proposition? Or is the\nincompatibilist asserting one thing while the compatibilist is denying\nsomething else?\n\nSome of the things said in the literature suggest that there is no\nsubstantive debate. For instance, some philosophers contrast a\n\u201cstrong incompatibilist ability\u201d with a \u201cweak\ncompatibilist ability\u201d (or \u201clibertarian free will\u201d\nwith \u201ccompatibilist free will\u201d) and write in a way that\nsuggests that they think that the only substantive question about free\nwill is whether it is or entails the \u201cstrong\u201d\nincompatibilist ability to do otherwise (since the \u201cweak\u201d\ncompatibilist ability to do otherwise is, by definition,\ncompatible with determinism). And one leading semantic proposal might\nseem to support the claim that there is no real dispute. According to\nthe Lewis/Kratzer, proposal \u2018can\u2019 (and other modal words,\nincluding \u2018is able\u2019, \u2018has the power\u2019,\n\u2018is free to\u2019) means \u2018compossible with relevant facts\nF\u2019, and the relevant facts are determined by the context\ntogether with the intentions of the speaker (D. Lewis 1976, Kratzer\n1977). For a different kind of contextualist proposal see Hawthorne\n2001; for criticism, see Feldman 2004. Whittle 2021 is a book-length\ndefense of a contextualist account of freedom and responsibility.\n\nSo, for instance, it might be true, given one context, that I can\nspeak Finnish (I\u2019m a native Estonian speaker, so it\nwouldn\u2019t take that long for me to learn Finnish) and false,\ngiven another context (don\u2019t take me to Finland as your\ninterpreter). There is no contradiction in saying that I both can and\ncan\u2019t speak Finnish, so long as we understand that what we are\nsaying is that my speaking Finnish is compossible with one set of\nfacts (my ability to easily learn the language) and not compossible\nwith another, more inclusive set of facts (my current inability to\nspeak it). Given this understanding of \u2018can, it might seem that\nthere is no genuine disagreement between the compatibilist and the\nincompatibilist. When the compatibilist asserts that deterministic\nagents are often able to do otherwise, she has in mind contexts (the\ncontexts of ordinary speakers, in daily life) in which the relevant\nfacts \\(F\\) are restricted to some relatively local facts\nabout the agent and her surroundings. When the incompatibilist denies\nthat any deterministic agent is ever able to do otherwise, she has in\nmind contexts (the contexts of philosophers discussing the free\nwill/determinism problem) in which the relevant facts include all\nthe facts about the laws and the past. So the proposition denied\nby the incompatibilist is not the proposition asserted by the\ncompatibilist.\n\nThe leading contemporary incompatibilist, van Inwagen, rejects any\nsuggestion that the compatibilist and the incompatibilist have a\nmerely verbal disagreement, either because they are using different\nsenses of \u2018can\u2019 (\u2018ability\u2019,\n\u2018power\u2019, \u201cfree will\u201d etc.) or because they are\nfocusing on different contexts of utterance. The debate, he says, is\nabout whether determinism has the consequence that no one is ever able\nto do otherwise (equivalently, that no one ever has it in their power\nto do otherwise) given what ordinary speakers mean, in the\ncontexts in which they use these words. The contexts to which he is\nreferring are the contexts of deliberation and choice in which we\nconsider our options, while believing that we are able to pursue each\nof them. When a compatibilist asserts, and an incompatibilist denies,\nthat a person at a deterministic world is sometimes able to do\notherwise, they mean exactly the same thing by \u2018is able\nto\u2019; they mean what ordinary English speakers mean (in these\ncontexts). The proposition asserted by the compatibilist is the\nproposition denied by the incompatibilist. Citing David Lewis as his\nexample of a compatibilist opponent, van Inwagen says that he and\nLewis cannot both be right. One of them is wrong, but neither is\nmuddled or making a simple mistake (van Inwagen 2008).\n\nIn what follows, we will assume that the debate about free will\n(including, but not necessarily limited to, genuine choice and the\nability to do otherwise) and determinism is a substantive debate, and\nnot one that can be dissolved by appeal to different senses or\ncontexts of utterance. We will now turn to the arguments.\n3. Arguments based on Intuition\n\nSome arguments for incompatibilism don\u2019t fall into either of the\ntwo varieties described above\u2014arguments that determinism is\nincompatible with ultimate sourcehood and arguments that determinism\nis incompatible with choice and the ability to do otherwise. These are\narguments that appeal primarily to our intuitions. There are many\nvariations on this way of arguing for incompatibilism, but the basic\nstructure of the argument is usually something like this:\n\nIf determinism is true, we are like: billiard balls, windup toys,\nplaythings of external forces, puppets, robots, victims of a nefarious\nneurosurgeon who controls us by directly manipulating the brain states\nthat are the immediate causes of our actions. Billiard balls (windup\ntoys, etc.) have no free will. So if determinism is true, we\ndon\u2019t have free will.\n\nMost of these intuition-based arguments are not very good. Even if\ndeterminism entails that there is something we have in common\nwith things which lack free will, it doesn\u2019t follow that there\nare no relevant differences. Billiard balls, toys, puppets, and simple\nrobots lack minds, and having a mind is a necessary condition of\nhaving free will. And determinism doesn\u2019t have the consequence\nthat all our actions are caused by irresistible desires that are, like\nthe neurosurgeon\u2019s direct manipulations, imposed on us by\nexternal forces outside our control. (For criticism of\n\u201cintuition pumps\u201d, see Dennett 1984. For discussion of\ncases involving more subtle kinds of manipulation, see\n Section 3.2.)\n\nWith this caveat in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the two\nmost influential intuition-based arguments.\n3.1 No Forking Paths Argument\n\nThe No Forking Paths argument (van Inwagen 1983; Fischer 1994; Ekstrom\n2000) begins by appealing to the idea that whenever we make a choice\nwe are doing (or think we are doing) something like what a traveler\ndoes when faced with a choice between different roads. The only roads\nthe traveler is able to choose are roads which are a continuation of\nthe road she is already on. By analogy, the only choices we are able\nto make are choices which are a continuation of the actual past\nand consistent with the laws of nature. If determinism is false,\nthen making choices really is like this: one \u201croad\u201d (the\npast) behind us, two or more different \u201croads\u201d (future\nactions consistent with the laws) in front of us. But if determinism\nis true, then our journey through life is like traveling (in one\ndirection only) on a road which has no branches. There are other\nroads, leading to other destinations; if we could get to one of these\nother roads, we could reach a different destination. But we\ncan\u2019t get to any of these other roads from the road we are\nactually on. So if determinism is true, our actual future is\nour only possible future; we are never able to choose or do\nanything other than what we actually do. (See also Flint 1987 and\nWarfield 2003 for discussion of a related argument that appeals to the\nmetaphor of our freedom to \u201cadd\u201d to the list of truths\nabout the world.)\n\nThis is intuitively powerful, since it\u2019s natural to think of our\nfuture as being \u201copen\u201d in the branching way suggested by\nthe road analogy and to associate this kind of branching structure\nwith freedom of choice. But several crucial assumptions have been\nsmuggled into this picture: assumptions about time and causation and\nassumptions about possibility. The assumptions about time and\ncausation needed to make the analogy work include the following: that\nwe \u201cmove\u201d through time in something like the way that we\nmove down a road, that our \u201cmovement\u201d is necessarily in\none direction only, from past to future, that the past is\nnecessarily \u201cfixed\u201d or beyond our control in some\nway that the future is not. These assumptions are all controversial;\non some theories of time and causation (the four-dimensionalist theory\nof time, a theory of causation that permits time travel and backwards\ncausation), they are all false (D. Lewis 1976; Horwich 1987; Sider\n2001; Hoefer 2003).\n\nThe assumption about possibility is that possible worlds are concrete\nspatio-temporal things (in the way that roads are) and that worlds can\noverlap (literally share a common part) in the way that roads can\noverlap. But most possible worlds theorists reject the first\nassumption and nearly everyone rejects the second assumption (D. Lewis\n1986).\n\nDeterminism (without these additional assumptions) does not\nhave the consequence that our \u201cjourney\u201d through life is\nlike moving down a road; the contrast between non-determinism and\ndeterminism is not the contrast between traveling on a\nbranching road and traveling on a road with no branches.\n\nAs an argument for incompatibilism, the appeal to the metaphor of the\nbranching roads (\u201cthe garden of forking paths\u201d) fails. If\nwe strip away the metaphors, the main premise of the argument turns\ninto the claim that we have genuine choices between alternative course\nof action only if our choosing and doing otherwise is compossible\nwith the actual past and the actual laws. But this claim is none\nother than a statement of what the incompatibilist believes and the\ncompatibilist denies.\n\nIf the intuitions to which the No Forking Paths argument appeals\nnevertheless continue to engage us, it is because we think that our\nrange of possible choices is constrained by two factors: the laws and\nthe past. We can\u2019t change or break the laws; we can\u2019t\ncausally affect the past. (Even if backwards causation is logically\npossible, it is not within our power.) These\nbeliefs\u2014about the laws and the past\u2014are the basis of the\nmost influential contemporary argument for incompatibilism: the\nConsequence argument. More of this later.\n3.2 Manipulation and Design Arguments\n\nWe turn now to a family of arguments that work by appealing to our\nintuitive response to cases involving two persons, whom we will call\n\u201cVictim\u201d and \u201cProducer\u201d. Producer designs or\nmanipulates Victim (in some of the stories, in the way the maker of a\nrobot designs his robot or a god creates a human being; in other\nstories, by employing techniques of behavioral engineering or neural\nmanipulation). Producer\u2019s purpose is to ensure either that\nVictim performs a specific action (Mele 1995, 2006, 2019; Rosen 2002;\nPereboom 1995, 2001, 2008, 2014) or that he will have the kind of\npsychology and motivational structure which will ensure or make\nprobable that he performs certain kinds of actions and leads a certain\nkind of life. (See Kane 1996 for discussion of Huxley\u2019s\nBrave New World and Skinner\u2019s Walden Two.)\n\nWe are supposed to agree that Victim is not morally responsible\nbecause he acts unfreely and that he acts unfreely because of\nProducer\u2019s role in the causation of his actions. Victim performs\nthe actions he performs because that\u2019s what he was designed or\nmore directly manipulated to do, and it was Producer who made him be\nthat way or do those things.\n\nThe argument then goes as follows:\n\nVictim doesn\u2019t act freely and, for that reason, is not\nmorally responsible for what he does.\nIf determinism is true, there is no relevant difference between\nVictim and any normal case of apparently free and morally\nresponsible action.\nTherefore, if determinism is true no one ever acts freely or is\nmorally responsible for what he does.\n\n\nWe are supposed to accept premise 1 on the grounds of our intuitive\nresponse to the story about Victim. The argument for premise 2 is that\nif determinism is true, then we are like Victim with respect to the\nfact that we are merely the proximate causes of our actions.\nWe do what we do because of the way we are (our psyche or\n\u201cdesign\u201d together with the total mix of our thoughts,\ndesires, and other psychological states at the time of action) and the\ncauses of these psychological characteristics ultimately come from\noutside us, from forces and factors beyond our control. The only\ndifference between us (in this imagined scenario in which determinism\nis true) and Victim is that our psychological features are not the\ncausal upshot of the work of a single Producer who had a specific plan\nfor us. But this fact about the remote causes of our\nactions\u2014that they are caused by a variety of natural causes\nrather than the intentional acts of a single agent\u2014is not\nrelevant to questions about our freedom and responsibility. Or so it\nis argued, by the advocates of Manipulation arguments.\n\nManipulation arguments may be seen as the Source\nincompatibilist\u2019s response to Frankfurt\u2019s thought\nexperiment. Frankfurt was trying to show that determinism isn\u2019t\nas bad as we might think. In his story, Black was a stand-in for\ndeterminism, and Frankfurt was trying to convince us that the facts\nabout Black are consistent with the facts, as we know them, about how\nwe actually deliberate, decide, and act, and these facts are\nthe only facts that matter, so far as moral responsibility is\nconcerned. So even if Jones lacks the ability to do otherwise, he is\nstill morally responsible. The Manipulation argument says, in\neffect:\n\nFrankfurt\u2019s thought experiment is faulty. Determinism\nisn\u2019t a powerful agent, standing by, in the background, like\nBlack. Determinism is part of the \u201cactual sequence\u201d. Let\nme tell you a story to make this clear\u2026\n\nAnd then Producer is introduced, and we are told that he has a plan\nconcerning the action or actions of another person, Victim, the power\nto enforce his plan, and moreover, unlike Black, he does\nenforce it.\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to think that manipulation of one\nperson by another automatically undermines freedom. In real life, we\nknow that we may be manipulated by others to do things we would not\nhave done, but for their arguments or other ways of persuading us to\nchange our minds. Absent further reasons, we don\u2019t think that\nthis kind of manipulation robs us of free will or the ability to act\nfreely in the way required for moral responsibility. We think that we\ncould have resisted the argument (or the sales pitch or the subtle\npressures exerted by our manipulative friend or colleague) and we\nmight blame ourselves later for not doing so.\n\nThe question, then, is whether there is a case that can serve the\npurposes of a manipulation argument: a case where Victim lacks the\nfreedom that is a necessary condition of moral responsibility while\nnot being different, in any relevant way, from a normal agent in\nnormal circumstances at a deterministic world (that is, from someone\nwho we think acts freely and is morally responsible for what she\ndoes).\n\nThere are cases and cases, and many of the ones in the literature are\nunder-described. The first three Plums of Pereboom 2001 are an\nexample. Depending on how the details are spelled out, our verdict\nabout Plum might be that he is unfree and not morally responsible\nbecause he is different, in relevant ways that don\u2019t require the\nfalsity of determinism, from a normal agent in normal circumstances\n(Fischer 2004; Mickelson 2010; Sripada 2012). Alternatively, the story\nmight be fleshed out in a way that supports the judgment that Plum is\nnot different, in any relevant way, from a normal agent\n(deterministic or indeterministic) in normal circumstances. But this\nleaves it open to the compatibilist to take the hard-line reply\n(McKenna 2004a, 2008; Jeppsson 2020) that since the normal\ndeterministic agent is morally responsible, so is Plum. Opinions vary\nas to whether the intuitive cost of the hard-line reply is too great\n(Pereboom 2008; McKenna 2014).\n\nConsider, next, cases of the Brave New World\nvariety\u2014cases where children are subjected to intensive\nbehavioral engineering from birth, in a way intended to make them\naccept their assigned roles in a rigidly hierarchical society.\nEverything depends on the details, but it is surely not implausible to\nthink that the subjects of some Brave New World cases lack a\nmorally significant freedom because their cognitive, evaluational, and\nvolitional capacities have been stunted or impaired in certain\nways:\n\n\nthey are incapable of effectively envisaging or seeing the\nsignificance of certain alternatives, of reflecting on themselves and\non the origins of their motivations. (Watson 1987)\n\n\nWolf 1990 argues, on the basis of similar cases, that the ability that\ngrounds our freedom and responsibility is the unimpaired capacity to\nchoose and act in accordance with \u201cthe True and the Good\u201d\n(see also Nelkin 2011). But determinism doesn\u2019t have the\nconsequence that everyone\u2019s cognitive, evaluational and\nvolitional capacities are impaired in these sorts of ways.\n\nThere are cases where Victim is under the direct control of Producer\nin a way that makes it true that Victim is not morally responsible for\nwhat she does because she no longer has the kind of causal\ncontrol that is a necessary condition acting freely. Producer\nmight, for instance, directly manipulate Victim\u2019s limbs so that\nVictim finds her body moving, puppetlike, in ways she does not intend.\nOr Producer might directly manipulate the brain states that are the\nneural realizers of Victim\u2019s first order desires so Victim is,\nlike Frankfurt\u2019s unwilling addict, acting intentionally but\n\u201cagainst her will\u201d (Frankfurt 1971). But determinism\ndoesn\u2019t have the consequence that we never act intentionally and\nit doesn\u2019t have the consequence that we always act contrary to\nour second order volitions or that we are always subject to\npsychological compulsions, addictive or \u201cirresistible\u201d\ndesires, phobias, and other pathological aversions.\n\nDefenders of Manipulation arguments claim, however, that the argument\nworks even if these kinds of cases are set aside. They say that the\nintuitive force of the argument depends only on the fact that\ndeterministically caused actions are ultimately caused, as are\nVictim\u2019s, by factors and forces outside the agent\u2019s\ncontrol. They say that the argument succeeds even in cases where\nProducer designs a Victim with unimpaired capacities and a normal\npsychology, perhaps the kind we\u2019d like our children to have,\nperhaps a rationally egoistic psychology of a kind we would prefer our\nchildren not to have. They also say that the argument succeeds even\nwhen Producer is such a sophisticated designer of Victim that Victim\nhas a past history that satisfies the requirements of those\ncompatibilist accounts of free agency that include a historical\ncondition. (For a helpful account of the difference between historical\nand nonhistorical compatibilist accounts in the context of\nManipulation arguments, see McKenna 2004a. For argument that the best\nexplanation for our belief that manipulated agents act unfreely is the\nbelief that these agents don\u2019t have it in their power to do\notherwise, see Berofsky 2012. For argument that Manipulation arguments\nfail given a Strawsonian account of responsibility, see Latham and\nTierney 2022.)\n\nThe best example of this kind of case is Mele\u2019s Ernie. Ernie was\ncreated as a zygote \\(Z\\) in Mary by goddess Diana because Diana\nwanted a certain event to take place 30 years later, and she was able\nto use her knowledge of the deterministic laws and the state of the\nentire universe to deduce that placing a zygote with precisely\n\\(Z\\)\u2019s constitution in Mary would produce a normal (or better\nthan normal: ideally self-controlled, rational, etc.) adult who would,\n30 years later, judge, on the basis of rational deliberation, that it\nis best to do \\(A\\) and who would \\(A\\) on the basis of her judgment,\nthereby bringing about \\(E\\) (Mele 2006, 2019).\n\nTo many people, it seems intuitively clear that Ernie acts unfreely\nand is for that reason not morally responsible for what he does. But\nif that\u2019s right, it looks like this version of the Manipulation\nargument succeeds. For consider this: Ernie has an atom-for-atom\nduplicate, Bert, a normal guy in every way, exactly like Ernie\n(ideally self-controlled, rational, etc.) except for the fact that he\nwas not created by a goddess. Bert finds himself in circumstances\nexactly like the ones Ernie is in, and Bert also judges, on the basis\nof rational deliberation, that it is best to do \\(A\\), and he also\nacts on the basis of his judgment, thereby bringing about \\(E\\). There\nappears to be no relevant difference between Ernie and Bert.\nTherefore, Bert also acts unfreely and is also not morally responsible\nfor what he does. But Bert (like Ernie) is normal in every way, and we\ncan also stipulate that he (like Ernie) satisfies all plausible\ncompatibilist conditions (historical as well as nonhistorical) for\nbeing a free and morally responsible agent. If Bert acts unfreely, so\ndoes every deterministic agent on every occasion.\nTherefore the kind of freedom necessary for moral responsibility is\nincompatible with determinism.\n\nMele claims that the case of Ernie is an improvement on earlier\nManipulation cases in two ways. First, it is a case where it is clear\nthat the causes of Ernie\u2019s action are deterministic\nrather than the kinds of causes that might be found at a\nnon-deterministic world. Second, it is a case where it is clear that\nthere is no relevant difference between Ernie and any case of\napparently free and responsible action at a deterministic world.\n\nDeery and Nahmias 2017 appeal to interventionist theories of causation\nto argue that Mele is wrong about the second claim. Tierney and Glick\n2020 criticise Deery and Nahmias. (See also Herdova 2020.)\n\nSuppose, however, that there is no relevant difference between Ernie\nand Bert. It does not follow that the argument succeeds. If there\nreally is no freedom-relevant difference between Bert and Ernie, why\nshould we reason from the unfreedom of Ernie to the unfreedom of Bert\nrather than the other way around, from the freedom of Bert to the\nfreedom of Ernie?\n\nAfter all, our grounds for saying that there is no relevant difference\nbetween the two is that the historical facts about Ernie\u2019s\ncreation (that he was created by a goddess, with the powers of a\nLaplacian predictor, with certain intentions, and so on) are not\nrelevant to the question of whether Ernie acts freely or unfreely 30\nyears later. If they are not relevant, they don\u2019t provide us\nwith reasons for thinking that Ernie is unfree. By contrast,\nwe do have reasons for thinking that Bert acts freely and is morally\nresponsible for what he does; he satisfies the ordinary conditions we\nuse in real life, as well as all the conditions of the best\ncompatibilist accounts on offer. If we started out with reasons for\nthinking Bert free and responsible (either because we are already\ncompatibilists or because we have never thought about determinism),\nthe Zygote argument hasn\u2019t given us any reason to change our\nminds. (For further elaboration on this critique, including some\nhelpful counter-thought experiments, see Fischer 2011, 2021; Kearns\n2012.)\n\nA defender of the Zygote argument might respond by claiming that the\nintuitions that favor the unfreedom and lack of responsibility of\nErnie are stronger than the intuitions that favor the freedom and\nresponsibility of Bert. But this is problematic. Intuitions are not\nalways evidentially trustworthy and there are, as we have already\nnoted, reasons for being wary of our intuitive response to\ndescriptions of deterministic worlds: we have a natural tendency to\nconfuse \u201cit will be\u201d with \u201cit must be\u201d. There\nare further reasons for not giving evidential credence to our\nintuitions about Ernie\u2019s unfreedom: he was created by a goddess,\nwith the kind of foreknowledge that no human being could have, for the\nexpress purpose of performing a certain action 30 years later. Perhaps\nour intuitions are explained (though not justified) by the belief that\nbeing created in this way robs Ernie of the freedom required for\nresponsibility. The first premise of the Zygote argument must be\ndefended by something more than appeal to intuition.\n\n(For some recent empirical work on intuitions about free will,\ndeterminism, and moral responsibility, see Nahmias, Morris,\nNadelhoffer, and Turner 2006, Nahmias 2011 and Murray & Nahmias\n2014. For a critique of the use of intuitions in Manipulation\narguments, see Vihvelin 2013 and Spitzley 2015.)\n\nDefenders of the Zygote argument don\u2019t dispute these points. The\nManipulation argument works only if the second premise is true, and\nthe second premise says that there is no relevant difference\nbetween Victim (in this case, Ernie) and any normal deterministic case\nof apparently free and responsible action (in this case, Bert). Ernie\ndiffers from Bert with respect to certain historical facts about his\ncreation: the fact that he was created by a goddess with\nforeknowledge, and intentions about his future. So none of these facts\ncan be counted relevant, even if they affect our intuitions.\nBut one historical fact is relevant, according to the\ndefender of the argument: the fact that the deterministic causes of\nErnie\u2019s action trace back thirty years to conditions outside his\ncontrol. The claim, then, is that Ernie acts unfreely and without\nresponsibility because determinism is true. But this claim was\nsupposed to be the conclusion of the argument, not the premise.\n\nThere is one remaining possibility. Perhaps our intuitions are best\nexplained by our belief that Ernie doesn\u2019t have it in his power\nto do anything other than act according to Diana\u2019s plan. (We\nthink it unfair to blame someone who wasn\u2019t able to avoid doing\nwhat he did.) If that\u2019s the case, then the back story of\nErnie\u2019s creation functions as a way of making vivid one of the\npossible ways that an otherwise normal agent at a deterministic world\nmight have got to be the way that he is at a certain moment in his\nlife. Should we reason from our belief that Ernie isn\u2019t, on that\noccasion, able to do otherwise to the belief that Bert and every\nnormal deterministic agent also lacks this ability, or should we\nreason in the opposite direction, from Bert\u2019s ability to do\notherwise to Ernie\u2019s? This requires further discussion, which we\nwill take up in the section on the Consequence argument. (See also\nMickelson 2015b and Huoranskzi 2021.)\n4. Sourcehood Arguments\n\nWhat has this boy to do with it? He was not his own father; he was not\nhis own mother; he was not his own grandparents. All of this was\nhanded to him. He did not surround himself with governesses and\nwealth. He did not make himself. And yet he is to be compelled to pay\n(Darrow 1924: 65).\n\nLet\u2019s turn now to arguments for incompatibilism based on the\nidea that a free and responsible action is an action that is caused\nand controlled by its agent in a special \u201cthe buck stops\nhere\u201d way, a way that is incompatible with deterministic\nevent-causation.\n\nThe most popular instance of this kind of argument is an argument that\nwe will call \u201cthe desperate defense attorney\u2019s\nargument\u201d (Darrow 1924). The defense attorney\u2019s argument\nis simple:\n\nMy client is responsible for his crime only if he \u201cmade\nhimself\u201d\u2014that is, only if he caused himself to be\nthe kind of person he is.\nMy client did not make himself.\nTherefore my client is not responsible for his crime.\n\n\nThe defense attorney is trying to persuade the jurors that his client\nis not responsible for his action, but not for any of the standard\nexcusing conditions\u2014insanity, accident, mistaken belief, duress,\nmental handicap, and so on. Nor does he claim that there is anything\nthat distinguishes his client from any of the rest of us. His argument\nis that his client is not responsible because he did not make himself.\nBut none of us has made ourselves (at least not from scratch)\u2014we\nare all the products of heredity and environment. So if we accept the\ndefense attorney\u2019s argument, it appears that we are committed to\nthe conclusion that no one is ever responsible for\nanything.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that this is an argument for incompatibilism.\nIt\u2019s an argument for incompatibilism only if it\u2019s an\nargument for hard determinism\u2014that is, if it\u2019s an argument\nfor the thesis that determinism is true and because of\nthis we are never responsible for anything. Let\u2019s take a\ncloser look.\n\nWhat\u2019s the argument for premise (2)? After all, we do make our\nselves, at least in the garden-variety way in which we make other\nthings: we plant gardens, cook dinners, build boats, write books and,\nover the course of our lives, re-invent, re-create, and otherwise\n\u201cmake something of ourselves\u201d. Of course we don\u2019t do\nany of these things \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, without help from\nanyone or anything else, but it\u2019s impossible (or at least\nimpossible for human beings) to make anything from scratch. The truth\nor falsity of determinism has no bearing on this point.\n\n(See G. Strawson 1986 and 1994 for an argument for the\nimpossibility of \u201ctrue responsibility\u201d that is a\nmore sophisticated version of the defense attorney\u2019s argument.\nSee also Smilansky 2000. See Mele 1995 and Clarke 2005 for a critique\nof Strawson\u2019s argument.)\n\nIf we pressed our defense attorney (or brought in a philosopher to\nhelp him out), we might get the following reply: The kind of\ngarden-variety self-making possible at a deterministic world is not\ngood enough for the kind of moral responsibility required for deserved\nblame and punishment. Granted, we can never have complete\ncontrol over the actions we perform because of our\nchoices (Nagel 1979), and this limits the control we have\nover our self-making. But we are morally responsible for our\nactions only if we have at least some control over our\nself-making, and we have control over our self-making only if we have\ncontrol over the choices that are the causes of the actions whereby we\nmake our selves. And we have control over these choices only if we\ncause our choices and no one and nothing causes us to make them\n(Chisholm 1964).\n\nThe defense attorney (or philosopher) is defending premise (2) by\narguing for a certain interpretation of premise (1)\u2014that our\nresponsibility for our actions requires that we have \u201cmade\nourselves\u201d in the sense that, over the course of our lives, we\nhave frequently been the first cause of the choices that\nresult in actions and thus eventually (albeit often in ways we can\nneither predict nor control) to changes in our selves. In arguing this\nway, he has shifted the focus of the argument from the obviously\nimpossible demand that the freedom required for moral responsibility\nrequires entirely self-made selves to the intuitively\nappealing and at least not obviously impossible demand that the\nfreedom required for moral responsibility requires what Robert Kane\nhas called \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d (that we are the\nultimate sources or first causes of at least some of our\nchoices\u2014those choices that are the causes of \u201cself-forming\nactions\u201d). (See Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a. See also Chisholm\n1964; Clarke 1993, 1996, 2003; O\u2019Connor 1995a, 2000, 2011;\nPereboom 2001, 2009b, 2014; Steward 2012).\n\nThis brings us to the philosopher\u2019s version of the defense\nattorney\u2019s argument. (For variations on this kind of argument,\nsee Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a and Pereboom 2001, 2005, 2014.)\n\nWe act freely (in the way necessary for moral responsibility) only\nif we are the ultimate sources (originators, first causes) of\nat least some of our choices.\nIf determinism is true, then everything we do is ultimately caused\nby events and circumstances outside our control.\nIf everything we do is ultimately caused by events and\ncircumstances outside our control, then we are not the\nultimate sources (originators, first causes) of any of our\nchoices.\nTherefore, if determinism is true, we are not the ultimate sources\nof any of our choices.\nTherefore, if determinism is true, we never act freely and we are\nnever morally responsible.\n\n\nPremise (2) follows from the definition of determinism (at least given\ntwo widely accepted assumptions: that there is causation in a\ndeterministic universe and that causation is a transitive relation).\n(For some doubts about the latter assumption, see Hall 2000.) Premise\n(3) is clearly true. So if we want to reject the conclusion, we must\nreject Premise (1).\n\nCompatibilists have argued against (1) in two different ways. On the\npositive side, they have argued that we can give a satisfactory\naccount of the (admittedly elusive) notion of self-determination\nwithout insisting that self-determination requires us to be the first\ncauses of our choices (Frankfurt 1971, 1988; Watson 1975, 1987, 2004;\nDennett 1984; Wolf 1990; Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza 1998; Bok\n1998; Nelkin 2011; Sartorio 2016). On the negative side,\ncompatibilists have challenged (1) by arguing that it is of no help to\nthe incompatibilist: if we accept (1), we are committed to the\nconclusion that free will and moral responsibility are\nimpossible, regardless of whether determinism is true or\nfalse.\n\nThe challenge to (1) takes the form of a dilemma: Either determinism\nis true or it\u2019s not. If determinism is true, then my choices are\nultimately caused by events and conditions outside my control, so I am\nnot their first cause and therefore, if we accept (1), I am neither\nfree nor responsible. If determinism is false, then something that\nhappens inside me (something that I call \u201cmy choice\u201d or\n\u201cmy decision\u201d) might be the first event in a\ncausal chain leading to a sequence of body movements that I call\n\u201cmy action\u201d. But since this event has no sufficient cause,\nwhether or not it happens is not under my control any more\nthan the spinning of a roulette wheel inside my brain is under my\ncontrol. Therefore, if determinism is false, I am not the\nfirst cause or ultimate source of my choices and, if we accept (1), I\nam neither free nor responsible (Ayer 1954; Wolf 1990).\n\nIn order to defend (1) against the \u201cdetermined or random\u201d\ndilemma, above, the incompatibilist has to offer a positive account of\nthe puzzling claim that persons are the first causes of their\nchoices. The traditional incompatibilist answer is that this claim\nmust be taken literally, at face value. We\u2014agents, persons,\nenduring things\u2014are causes with a very special property: we\ninitiate causal chains, but nothing and no one causes us to do this.\nLike God, we are uncaused causers, or first movers. If Joe\ndeliberately throws a rock, which breaks a window, then the\nwindow\u2019s breaking (an event) was caused by Joe\u2019s throwing\nthe rock (another event), which was caused by Joe\u2019s choice\n(another event). But Joe\u2019s choice was not caused by any further\nevent, not even the event of Joe\u2019s thinking it might be fun to\nthrow the rock; it was caused by Joe himself. And since Joe\nis not an event, he is not the kind of thing which can be caused. (Or\nso it is argued, by agent-causalists. See Chisholm 1964;\nO\u2019Connor 1995a, 2000, 2011; Pereboom 2001.)\n\nMany philosophers think that agent-causation is either incoherent or\nimpossible, due to considerations about causation. What sense does it\nmake to say that a person, as opposed to a change in a\nperson, or the state of a person at a time, is a cause? (Bok\n1998). (See also Clarke 2003 for a detailed and sympathetic\nexamination of the metaphysics of agent-causation, which ends with the\nconclusion that there are, on balance, reasons to think that\nagent-causation is impossible.)\n\nOthers (van Inwagen 2000; Mele 2006) have argued that even if\nagent-causation is possible, it would not solve the problem of\ntransforming an undetermined event into one which is in our\ncontrol in the way that our free choices must be. And others have\nargued that if agent-causation is possible, it is possible at\ndeterministic as well as non-deterministic worlds (Markosian 1999;\nNelkin 2011; Franklin 2016).\n\nSome incompatibilists have responded to the \u201cdetermined or\nrandom\u201d dilemma in a different way: by appealing to the idea of\nprobabilistic causation (Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a). If our choices\nare events which have probabilistic causes (e.g., our beliefs,\ndesires, and other reasons for acting), then it no longer seems\nplausible to say that we have no control over them. We make\nchoices for reasons, and our reasons cause our choices, albeit\nindeterministically. Kane\u2019s reply may go some way towards\navoiding the second (no control) horn of the dilemma. But it\ndoesn\u2019t avoid the first horn. If our choices are caused by our\nreasons, then our choices are not the first causes of our actions. And\nour reasons are presumably caused, either deterministically or\nprobabilistically, so they are not the first causes of our actions\neither. But then our actions are ultimately caused by earlier events\nover which we have no control and we are not the ultimate sources of\nour actions.\n5. Choice and the Consequence Argument\n\nWe think that we make choices, and we think that our choices typically\nmake a difference to our future. We think that there is a point to\ndeliberation: how we deliberate\u2014what reasons we\nconsider\u2014makes a difference to what we choose and thus to what\nwe do. We also think that when we deliberate there really is\nmore than one choice we are able to make, more than one action we are\nable to perform, and more than one future which is, at least partly,\nin our power to bring about.\n\nOur beliefs about our powers with respect to the future contrast\nsharply with our beliefs about our lack of power with respect to the\npast. We don\u2019t think we have any choice about the past.\nWe don\u2019t deliberate about the past; we think it irrational to do\nanything aimed at trying to change or affect the past (\u201cYou had\nyour chance; you blew it. It\u2019s too late now to do anything about\nit\u201d). Our beliefs about our options, opportunities,\nalternatives, possibilities, abilities, powers, and so on, are all\nfuture-directed. We may summarize this contrast by saying that we\nthink that the future is \u201copen\u201d in some sense that\ncontrasts with the non-openness or \u201cfixity\u201d of the\npast.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t think we (now) have a choice about the past,\nwe have beliefs about what was possible for us in the past.\nWhen called upon to defend what we did, or when we blame or reproach\nourselves, or simply wonder whether we did the right thing (or the\nsensible thing, the rational thing, and so on), we evaluate our action\nby comparing it to what we believe were our other possible actions,\nat that time. We blame, criticize, reproach, regret, and so\non, only insofar as we believe we had alternatives. And if we later\ndiscover that we were mistaken in believing that some action \\(X\\) was\namong our alternatives, we think it is irrational to criticize or\nregret our failure to do \\(X\\).\n\nIs determinism compatible with the truth of these beliefs? In\nparticular, is it compatible with the belief that we are often able to\nchoose and do more than one action?\n\nIncompatibilists have traditionally said \u201cNo\u201d. And\nit\u2019s not hard to see why. If we think of \u2018can\u2019 in\nthe \u201copen future\u201d way suggested by the commonsense view,\nthen it\u2019s tempting to think that the past is necessary in some\nabsolute sense. And it\u2019s natural to think that we are able to do\notherwise only if we can do otherwise given this \u201cfixed\u201d\npast; that is, only if our doing otherwise is a possible\ncontinuation of the actual past. If we follow this train of thought,\nwe will conclude that we are able to do otherwise only if our doing\notherwise is a possible continuation of the past consistent with\nthe laws. But if determinism is true, there is only one\npossible continuation of the past consistent with the laws. And thus\nwe get the incompatibilist conclusion. If determinism is true, our\nactual future is our only possible future. What we actually do is the\nonly thing we are able to do.\n\nBut this argument is too quick. It rests on assumptions about the\nnature of time which are arguably at odds with what physics tells us.\n(Hoefer 2003 [2016], Ismael 2016.) There is an alternative explanation\nfor our beliefs about the \u201copen\u201d future as opposed to the\n\u201cfixed\u201d past\u2014the direction of causation. Causes are\nalways earlier than their effects. Our deliberation causes our\nchoices, which cause our actions. But not the other way around. Our\nchoices cause future events; they never cause past events. Why\ncausation works this way is a deep and difficult question, but the\nleading view, among philosophers of science, is that the temporal\nasymmetry of causation is a fundamental but contingent fact about our\nuniverse. If things were different enough\u2014if we could travel\nbackwards in time\u2014then we would sometimes have an ability that\nwe don\u2019t actually have\u2014the ability to causally affect past\npersons and things (Horwich 1987; D. Lewis 1976). If this is right,\nthen we don\u2019t need to suppose that the past is metaphysically or\nabsolutely necessary in order to explain the fixed past/open future\ncontrast. The past could have been different. But, given the\nway things actually are, there is nothing that we are able to do\nthat would causally affect the past.\n\nThis alternative explanation of our commonsense belief about the\ncontrast between fixed past and open future allows the compatibilist\nto say the kind of things that compatibilists have traditionally\nwanted to say: The \u2018can\u2019 of our freedom of will and\nfreedom of action is the \u2018can\u2019 of causal and\ncounterfactual dependence. Our future is open because it depends,\ncausally and counterfactually, on our choices, which in turn depend,\ncausally and counterfactually, on our deliberation and on the reasons\nwe take ourselves to have. (At least in the normal case, where there\nis neither external constraint nor internal compulsion or other\npathology.) If our reasons were different (in some appropriate way),\nwe would choose otherwise, and if we chose otherwise, we would do\notherwise. And our reasons can be different, at least in the\nsense that we, unlike simpler creatures and young children, have the\nability to critically evaluate our reasons (beliefs, desires,\nvalues, principles, and so on) and that we have, and at least\nsometimes exercise, the ability to change our reasons (Bok\n1998; Dennett 1984; Fischer 1994; Fischer & Ravizza 1998;\nFrankfurt 1971, 1988; Lehrer 1976, 1980, 2004; Watson 1975, 1987,\n2004; Wolf 1990; Smith 1997, 2004; Pettit & Smith 1996; Nelkin\n2011; Vihvelin 2004, 2013). All this is compatible with determinism.\nSo the truth of determinism is compatible with the truth of our\ncommonsense belief that we really do have a choice about the future,\nthat we really can choose and do other than what we actually do.\n\nIncompatibilists think that this, and any compatibilist\naccount of the \u2018can\u2019 of freedom of choice, is, and\nmust be, mistaken. The Consequence Argument (Ginet 1966,\n1983, 1990; van Inwagen 1975, 1983, 2000; Wiggins 1973; Lamb 1977) is\nwidely regarded as the best argument for this conclusion. In the\nremainder of this section we will take a closer look at van\nInwagen\u2019s version of this important and influential\nargument.\n\nIn An Essay on Free Will (1983), van Inwagen presents three\nformal arguments which, he says, are intended as three versions of the\nsame basic argument, which he characterized as follows:\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequence of laws of\nnature and events in the remote past. But it\u2019s not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (1983: 56)\n\n\nWe will begin by looking at the third version of the argument (the\nRule Beta argument). The Rule Beta argument uses a modal sentential\noperator which van Inwagen defines as follows:\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\)\u2019 abbreviates \u2018\\(p\\) and no one has,\nor ever had, any choice about whether \\(p\\)\u2019. Van Inwagen tells\nus that the logic of \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019 includes these two\ninference rules, where \\(\\Box p\\) asserts that it is logically\nnecessity that \\(p\\):\n\n\nAlpha: From \\(\\Box p\\), we may infer\n\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\).\n\nBeta: From \\(\\mathbf{N}p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N}(p \\supset\nq)\\), we may infer \\(\\mathbf{N}q\\).\n\n\nIn the argument below, \u2018\\(L\\)\u2019 is an abbreviation for a\nsentence expressing a conjunction of all the laws of nature;\n\u2018\\(H\\)\u2019 is a sentence expressing a true proposition about\nthe total state of the world at some time in the distant past before\nany agents existed; \u2018\\(\\Box\\)\u2019 is \u2018it is logically\nnecessary that\u2019; \u2018\\(\\supset\\)\u2019 is the material\nconditional, and \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 is a dummy for which we may\nsubstitute any sentence which expresses a true proposition.\n\nThe argument is a conditional proof: Assume determinism and show that\nit follows that no one has, or ever had, a choice about any\ntrue proposition, including propositions about the apparently free\nactions of human beings.\n\n\n\n1.\n\\(\\Box((H \\amp L) \\supset P)\\)\ndefinition of determinism \n\n2.\n\\(\\Box(H \\supset(L \\supset P)\\)\nfrom 1, by modal and sentential logic \n\n3.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(H \\supset(L \\supset P))\\)\nfrom 2, by rule Alpha \n\n4.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}H\\)\npremise, fixity of past \n\n5.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(L \\supset P)\\)\nfrom 3, 4, by rule Beta \n\n6.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}L\\)\npremise, fixity of laws \n\n7.\n\\(\\mathbf{N}P\\)\nfrom 5, 6, by rule Beta  \n\n\nPremises (1) and (2) follow from determinism. (3) follows from (2), by\napplication of rule Alpha. Rule Alpha seems uncontroversial. (But see\nSpencer 2017).\n\nPremises 4 and 6 also look uncontroversial. \\(N\\) necessity\nisn\u2019t logical or metaphysical necessity. We can insist that the\nlaws and the distant past could, in the broadly logical\nsense, have been different, so neither \\(\\Box H\\) nor \\(\\Box L\\) are\ntrue. But it still seems undeniably true that we have no\nchoice about whether the laws and the distant past are the way\nthey are; there is nothing that we are able to do that would\nmake it the case that either the laws or the distant past are\ndifferent from the way they actually are.\n\nRule Beta is the key to the argument. It\u2019s what makes the\ndifference between this version of the Consequence Argument and an\nargument widely agreed to be fallacious.\n\n\n\\(\\Box(P \\supset Q)\\)\n\n\\(P\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box Q\\)\n\n\nAn example of this invalid inference is an argument sometimes called\n\u201cthe fatalist fallacy\u201d:\n\n\n\\(\\Box\\)(it\u2019s true that it will rain tomorrow \\(\\supset\\) it\nwill rain tomorrow)\n\nIt\u2019s true that it will rain tomorrow\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box\\)(it will rain tomorrow)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n\\(\\Box((H \\amp L) \\supset P)\\)\n\n\\(H \\amp L\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box P\\)\n\n\nOn the other hand, the following is a valid inference:\n\n\n\\(\\Box P\\)\n\n\\(\\Box(P \\supset Q)\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\Box Q\\)\n\n\nThe necessity expressed by the \u2018no choice about\u2019 operator\nis not logical or metaphysical necessity. But it might nevertheless be\nsimilar enough for Beta to be a valid rule of inference. Or so argued\nvan Inwagen, and gave examples:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(The sun explodes in the year 2000)\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(The sun explodes in the year 2000 \\(\\supset\\) All life\non earth ends in the year 2000)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbf{N}\\)(All life on earth ends in the year 2000)\n\n\nAn early response to the Consequence argument was to argue that Beta\nis invalid because a compatibilist account of the ability to do\notherwise is correct (Gallois 1977; Foley 1979; Slote 1982; Flint\n1987). For instance, if \u201c\\(S\\) is able to do \\(X\\)\u201d means\n\u201cif \\(S\\) tried to do \\(X\\), \\(S\\) would do \\(X\\)\u201d, then\nthe premises of the argument are true (since even if \\(S\\) tried to\nchange the laws or the past, she would not succeed), but the\nconclusion is false (since determinism is consistent with the truth of\ncounterfactuals like \u201cif \\(S\\) tried to raise her hand, she\nwould\u201d).\n\nIncompatibilists were unmoved by this response, saying, in effect,\nthat the validity of Beta is more plausible than the truth of any\ncompatibilist account of ability to do otherwise. They pointed out\nthat there was no agreement, even among compatibilists, about how such\nan account should go, and that the simplest accounts (so-called\n\u201cConditional Analyses\u201d, originally proposed by Hume) had\nbeen rejected, even by compatibilists.\n\n(For criticism of Simple Conditional Analyses, see Austin 1956;\nChisholm 1964; Lehrer 1968, 1976; van Inwagen 1983. For defense of a\ncompatibilist account of ability to do otherwise, see Moore 1912;\nHobart 1934; Kapitan 1991, 1996, 2011; Lehrer 1980, 2004; Bok 1998;\nSmith 1997, 2004; Campbell 2005; Perry 2004, 2008, 2010; Vihvelin\n2004, 2013; Fara 2008; Schlosser 2017; Menzies 2017; List 2019.)\n\nMore recently, van Inwagen has conceded that Beta is invalid (van\nInwagen 2000). McKay and Johnson (1996) showed that Beta entails\nAgglomeration:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}p\\)\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}q\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(\\mathbf{N}(p \\amp q)\\)\n\n\nAgglomeration is uncontroversially invalid. To see this, let\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 abbreviate \u2018The coin does not land\nheads\u2019, let \u2018q\u2019 abbreviate \u2018The coin does not\nland tails\u2019, and suppose that it\u2019s a fair coin which\nisn\u2019t tossed but someone could have tossed it (McKay and Johnson\n1996).\n\n(For counterexamples to Beta, see Widerker 1987, Huemer 2000, and\nCarlson 2000.)\n\nVan Inwagen proposed to repair the Consequence argument by replacing\n\u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019 with \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)*\u2019,\nwhere \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}*p\\)\u2019\nsays \u201c\\(p\\) and\nno one can, or ever could, do anything such that if she did it, \\(p\\)\nmight be false\u201d. Agglomeration is valid for \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)*\u2019,\nand thus this\nparticular objection to the validity of Beta does not apply.\n\nIt has also been suggested (Finch & Warfield 1998) that the\nConsequence argument can be repaired by keeping \u2018\\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\u2019\nand replacing Beta with\nBeta 2:\n\n\nBeta 2: From \\(\\mathbf{N}p\\) and \\(\\Box(p \\supset\nq)\\), we may infer \\(\\mathbf{N}q\\)\n\n\nThis would yield the following argument:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{N}(L \\amp H)\\)\nfixity of laws and past \n\n\\(\\Box((L \\amp H) \\supset P)\\)\ndeterminism \n\nNP\nfrom 1, 2 by Beta 2  \n\n\nOther ways of repairing the argument have been proposed by\nO\u2019Connor 1993 and Huemer 2000.\n\nSo it still looks as though the compatibilist is in trouble. For it\nseems plausible to suppose that there is nothing that we are able to\ndo that might make it the case that either \\(H\\) or \\(L\\) is\nfalse. And it seems plausible to suppose that we have no choice about\nwhether \\((H \\amp L)\\). We need to dig deeper to criticize the\nargument.\n\nDavid Lewis tells us to think of the argument as a reductio (Lewis\n1981). A compatibilist is someone who claims that the truth of\ndeterminism is compatible with the existence of the kinds of abilities\nthat we assume we have in typical choice situations. Let\u2019s call\nthese \u2018ordinary abilities\u2019. The Consequence argument, as\nLewis articulates it, says that if we assume that a deterministic\nagent has ordinary abilities, we are forced to credit her with\nincredible abilities as well.\n\nHere, with some modifications, is Lewis\u2019s statement of the\nargument:\n\nPretend that determinism is true, and that I did not raise my hand (at\nthat department meeting, to vote on that proposal) but had the ability\nto do so. If I had exercised my ability\u2014if I had raised my\nhand\u2014then either the remote past or the laws of physics would\nhave been different (would have to have been different). But if\nthat\u2019s so, then I have at least one of two incredible\nabilities\u2014the ability to change the remote past or the ability\nto change the laws. But to suppose that I have either of these\nabilities is absurd. So we must reject the claim that I had the\nability to raise my hand.\n\nThis counterfactual version of the Consequence argument nicely\nhighlights a point that the rule Beta version glosses over. The\nargument relies on a claim about counterfactuals. The\nargument says that if determinism is true, then at least one of these\ncounterfactuals is true:\n\n\nDifferent Past: If I had raised my hand, the remote\npast would have been different.\n\nDifferent Laws: If I had raised my hand, the laws\nwould have been different.\n\n\nBoth these counterfactuals strike many people as incredible. But there\nis a reason for that\u2014we are not used to thinking in terms of\ndeterminism and we are not accustomed to counterfactual speculation\nabout what would have been the case, beforehand, if anything\nat a deterministic world had happened in any way other than the way it\nactually happened.\n\nOn the other hand, we are good at evaluating counterfactuals, or at\nleast some counterfactuals, and we are especially good at evaluating\nthose counterfactuals that we entertain in contexts of choice, when we\nask questions about the causal upshots of our contemplated actions.\n(What would happen if\u2026 I struck this match, put my finger in\nthe fire, threw this rock at that window, raised my hand?) And when we\ncontemplate our options, we take for granted the existence of many\nfacts\u2014including facts about the laws and the past.\n\nIn other words, when we evaluate counterfactuals in real life, we do\nso by considering imaginary situations which are very like the\nsituation we are actually in, and we do not suppose that there are any\ngratuitous departures from actuality. And to suppose a\ndifference in the past or the laws seems like a gratuitous\ndifference.\n\nSo it is no surprise that when our attention is directed to\n Different Past\n and\n Different Laws,\n these counterfactuals strike us as incredible, or at least\nodd. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they are false, and if\ndeterminism is true, then either\n Different Past\n or\n Different Laws\nis true.\n\nSo the first point is that we all need a theory of counterfactuals,\nand if determinism is true, the true counterfactuals will include\neither\n Different Past\n or\n Different Laws.\n\nThe second point is that the details of the correct compatibilist\nsolution to the free will/determinism problem will turn on the details\nof the correct theory of counterfactuals.\n\n(For similar criticisms of the Consequence argument, see Fischer 1983,\n1988; Horgan 1985; Watson 1987; Vihvelin 1988, 2008, 2013; Rummens\n2021.)\n\nIf Lewis\u2019s theory of counterfactuals (D. Lewis 1973, 1979) is\ncorrect, or even more or less correct (Schaffer 2004), then the\nrelevant counterfactuals about the past and laws, at a deterministic\nworld, are:\n\n\nAlmost the Same Past: If I had raised my hand, the\npast would have been exactly the same until a time shortly before the\ntime of my decision to raise my hand.\n\nSlightly Different Laws: If I had raised my hand, the\nlaws would have been ever so slightly different in a way that\npermitted a divergence from the lawful course of actual history\nshortly before the time of my decision to raise my hand.\n\n\nOn the other hand, if Lewis\u2019s theory is wrong, and\ncounterfactuals are always evaluated by holding the laws constant,\nthen the relevant counterfactuals, at a deterministic world, are:\n\n\nSame Laws: If I had raised my hand, the laws would\nstill have been exactly the same.\n\nDifferent Past: If I had raised my hand, past history\nwould have been at least somewhat different all the way back to the\nBig Bang.\n\n\n(For critique of Lewis\u2019s theory, and defense of a theory of\ncounterfactuals that holds the laws fixed, see Bennett 1984; Dorr\n2016; Vihvelin 2017b.)\n\nWe\u2019ve got to choose. We all need a theory of counterfactuals,\nand our theory should provide the correct verdicts for the\nuncontroversially true counterfactuals at deterministic as well as\nindeterministic worlds. Our choice is limited to a theory that accepts\n Different Laws\n or\n Different Past.\n Which theory we choose has nothing to do with the free\nwill/determinism problem and everything with how we evaluate\ncounterfactuals.\n\nWe can now explain the essence of Lewis\u2019s reply to the\ncounterfactual version of the Consequence argument in a way that\ndoesn\u2019t require you to accept Lewis\u2019s theory of\ncounterfactuals.\n\nThe argument trades on an equivocation between two\ncounterfactuals.\n\n(C1)\nIf I had raised my hand, the laws (or the past) would have been\ndifferent.\n(C2)\nIf I had raised my hand, I would thereby have caused the\nlaws (or the past) to be different.\n\n\nThere is a corresponding equivocation between two ability claims:\n\n(A1)\nI had the ability to do something (raise my hand) such that if I\nhad exercised my ability, the laws (or the past) would have been\ndifferent.\n(A2)\nI had the ability to do something (raise my hand) such that if I\nhad exercised my ability, I would thereby have caused the\nlaws (or the past) to be different.\n\n\nThe problem with the argument, says Lewis, is that it equivocates\nbetween these two ability claims. To count as a reductio against the\ncompatibilist, the argument must establish that the compatibilist is\ncommitted to\n (A2).\n But the compatibilist is committed only to\n (C1)\n and thus only to\n (A1).\n The compatibilist is committed only to saying that if determinism is\ntrue, we have abilities we would exercise only if the past\n(or the laws) had been different in the appropriate ways. And while\nthis may sound odd, it is no more incredible than the claim that the\nsuccessful exercise of our abilities depends, not only on us, but also\non the co-operation of things not in our control: the good or bad luck\nof our immediate surroundings. Since we are neither superheroes nor\ngods, we are always in this position, regardless of the truth or\nfalsity of determinism.\n\nThe Consequence Argument was intended as an argument from premises\nthat we must all accept\u2014premises about our lack of control over\nthe past and the laws\u2014to the conclusion that if determinism is\ntrue, we don\u2019t have the free will common sense says we have. The\ncounterfactual version of the argument claims that if we attribute\nordinary abilities to deterministic agents, we are forced to credit\nthem with incredible past or law-changing abilities as well. But no\nsuch incredible conclusion follows. All that follows is something that\nwe must accept anyway, as the price of our non-godlike nature: that\nthe exercise of our abilities always depends, in part, on\ncircumstances outside our control. (See also Fischer 1983, 1988, 1994;\nWatson 1987; Nelkin 2001; Vihvelin 2008, 2011, 2013, 2017; Kapitan\n1991, 2011; Carlson 2000.)\n\nIf the aim of the Consequence argument was to show that no\ncompatibilist account of \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019\ncan succeed, then Lewis is surely right; the reductio fails.\nThe distinction between\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)\n permits the compatibilist to avoid making incredible claims about the\npowers of free determined agents. On the other hand, the\nincompatibilist surely has a point when she complains that it is\ndifficult to believe that anyone has the ability described by\n (A1).\n We believe that our powers as agents are constrained by the past and\nby the laws. One way to understand this belief is compatible with\ndeterminism: we lack causal power over the past and\nthe laws. But it\u2019s natural to understand the constraint\nin a different, simpler way: we are able to do only those things which\nare such that our doing of them does not counterfactually require a\ndifference in either the past or the laws. And this leads more or less\ndirectly to the incompatibilist conclusion that if determinism is\ntrue, then we are never able to do otherwise.\n\nThis brings us back to our starting point. Our common sense web of\nbeliefs about ourselves as deliberators, choosers, and agents includes\nthe belief that the future is open in some sense that the past is not.\nIt also includes the belief that our abilities and powers are\nconstrained by the laws. One way of understanding these beliefs leads\nto incompatibilism; another way does not. Which one is right?\n\nThe Consequence argument is an attempt to provide an argument\nin defense of the incompatibilist\u2019s way of understanding these\ncommon sense beliefs. Even if it fails as a reductio, it has been\nsuccessful in other ways. It has made it clear that the free\nwill/determinism problem is a metaphysical problem and that the\nunderlying issues concern questions about our abilities and powers, as\nwell as more general questions about the nature of causation,\ncounterfactuals, and laws of nature. Can the abilities or powers of\nchoosers and agents be understood as a kind of natural capacity or\ndisposition? Is there a viable incompatibilist alternative? How should\nwe understand counterfactuals about the alternative actions and\nchoices of agents at deterministic worlds? Is the compatibilist\nproposal about the way in which the laws and past constrain us\ndefensible? Are incompatibilists committed to the defense of a\nparticular view about the nature of laws of nature? Are they committed\nto the rejection of a Humean view, for instance?\n\nInsofar as the Consequence argument has pointed us in the direction of\nthese deep and difficult underlying metaphysical questions, it\nrepresents a significant step forward in the discussion of one of the\nmost intractable problems of philosophy.
