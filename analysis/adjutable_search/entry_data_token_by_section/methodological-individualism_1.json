    "main_text": "Austrian School and the Methodenstreit\n2. Austrian School and the Methodenstreit\n\n\nIt has never escaped anyone\u2019s attention that the discipline that most\nclearly satisfies the strictures of methodological individualism is\nmicroeconomics (in the tradition of neoclassical marginalism), and\nthat homo economicus is the most clearly articulated model of\nrational action. Of course, this tradition has not always been in the\nascendancy within the economics profession. In particular, there are\nmany who have felt that macroeconomics could be a completely\nself-standing domain of inquiry (reflected in the fact that the\nundergraduate economics curriculum is still often divided into\n\u201cmicro\u201d and \u201cmacro.\u201d) There have always been\nthose who would like to plot the movements of the business cycle, or\nof the stock market, in a way that disregards entirely the motives\nthat individual actors may have for doing what they do. Similarly,\nmany have tried to discover correlations between macroeconomic\nvariables, such as unemployment and inflation rates, without feeling\nthe need to speculate as to why a change in one rate might lead to\nmovement in the other.  Thus there has always been a very lively\ndebate within the economics profession about the value of the\n\u201crational actor\u201d model that is at the heart of general\nequilibrium theory.\n\n\nOne of the earliest iterations of this debate occurred during the\nso-called Methodenstreit between members of the Austrian\nSchool in Economics and the German Historical School. However, members\nof the \u201cfirst generation\u201d of the Austrian School, such\nas Carl Menger, were atomists (Menger defended his individualistic method\nin terms of conceptual gains achieved by \u201creducing complicated\nphenomena to their elements\u201d [Menger 1883, 93]). It was\nonly members of the second generation, first and foremost Friedrich\nvon Hayek, who would explicitly identify themselves with the Weberian\ndoctrine of methodological individualism and defend it through\nreference to the demands of interpretive social science. The key text\nis Hayek\u2019s paper, \u201cScientism and the Study of Society,\u201d\nserialized in Economica (1942\u201344), and later published as the\nfirst part of The Counter-Revolution of Science (1955).\n\n\nIn Hayek\u2019s view, the desire on the part of social scientists to\nemulate the physical sciences creates an exaggerated fear of\nteleological or \u201cpurposive\u201d concepts. This leads many\neconomists to eschew any reference to intentional states and to focus\npurely upon statistical correlations between economic variables. The\nproblem with this focus is that it leaves the economic phenomena\nunintelligible. Take, for example, the movement of prices. One might\nnotice a constant correlation between the date of the first frost and\nfluctuations in the price of wheat. But we do not really\nunderstand the phenomenon until it has been explained in\nterms of the rational actions of economic agents: an early frost\nreduces yields, leading to less intense price competition among\nsuppliers, more among consumers, etc. Thus Hayek insists that, in\neffect, all macroeconomic analysis is incomplete in the absence of\n\u201cmicro\u201d foundations.\n\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while Hayek has a model of\nrational action as the centerpiece of his view, his is most\nemphatically not a form of rationalism. On the contrary, he puts\nparticular emphasis upon the way that various economic phenomena can\nemerge as the unintended consequences of rational action. Even though\nthe outcomes that people achieve may bear no resemblance to the ones\nthat they intended, it is still important to know what they\nthought they were doing when they chose to pursue to course\nof action that they chose \u2013 not least because it is important to\nknow why they persist in pursuing that course of action, despite the\nfact that it is not producing the intended consequences.\n\n\nOf course, part of Hayek\u2019s motivation for endorsing methodological\nindividualism and demanding that social-scientific explanations\nspecify a mechanism at the action-theoretic level is that he wants to\nemphasize the limitations of the individual\u2019s actor\u2019s\nperspective. It\u2019s fine to talk about macroeconomic variables like\n\u201cthe inflation rate,\u201d but it is important to remember that\nindividual actors (generally speaking) do not respond directly to such\nindicators. All that they can see are changes in the immediate prices\nthat they must pay for production inputs or consumption goods, and\nthis is what they respond to. The large-scale consequences of the\nchoices they make in response to these changes are largely unintended,\nand so any regularity in these consequences constitutes a spontaneous\norder. This is a crucial element of Hayek\u2019s information-based argument\nfor capitalism: economic actors do not have access to the same\ninformation as economic theorists, thus it is only when we see the\noperations of the economy through their eyes that we can begin to see\nthe advantages of a decentralized system of coordination like the\nmarket.\n\n\nTo illustrate the importance of the individual\u2019s perspective, Hayek\ngives the example of the process that leads to the development of a\npath in the woods. One person works his way through, choosing the\nroute that offers the least local resistance. His passage reduces,\never so slightly, the resistance offered along that route to the next\nperson who walks though, who is therefore, in making the same set of\ndecisions, likely to follow the same route. This increases the chances\nthat the next person will do so, and so on. Thus the net of effect of\nall these people passing through is that they \u201cmake a\npath,\u201d even though no one has the intention of doing so, and no\none even plans out its trajectory. It is a product of spontaneous\norder: \u201cHuman movements through the district come to conform to\na definite pattern which, although the result of deliberate decisions\nof many people, has yet not been consciously designed by anyone\u201d\n(Hayek 1942, 289).\n\n\nThe problem with ignoring the agent\u2019s perspective, in Hayek\u2019s view, is\nthat it can easily lead us to overestimate our powers of rational\nplanning and control, and thus to fall into \u201crationalism.\u201d\nBy contrast, the central virtue of methodological individualism is\nthat it helps us to see the limitations of our own reason (Hayek 1944,\n33). Formulating theories that refer directly to the \u201cinterest\nrate,\u201d or \u201cinflationary pressures,\u201d or \u201cthe\nunemployment rate\u201d can mislead us into thinking that we can\nmanipulate these variables, and thus intervene successfully in the\neconomy. We forget that these concepts are abstractions, used not to\nguide individual action, but rather to describe the net effect of\nmillions of individual decisions. The key characteristic of\nmethodological individualism is that it \u201csystematically starts\nfrom the concepts which guide individuals in their actions and not\nfrom the results of their theorizing about their actions\u201d (1942,\n286). It therefore encourages, in Hayek\u2019s view, greater modesty with\nrespect to social planning.\n\n\nHayek does not mention methodological individualism after the\n1950s. Indeed, the role that evolutionary explanations come to play in\nhis later work implies a tacit retraction of his commitment to the\ndoctrine.\n",
