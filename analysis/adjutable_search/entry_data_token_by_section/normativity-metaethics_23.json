    "main_text": "Is Normativity Mind-Dependent?\n5. Is Normativity Mind-Dependent?\n\nMany of the views just canvassed share a common theme: normativity is\nexplained in terms of the mental states, events, or attitudes of\nindividuals or collections of individuals. (We\u2019ll call these\n\u201cmental states\u201d for short.) Many other\nviews \u2013 including some of those just canvassed \u2013 think that\nthere is some important sense in which the normative facts are\nindependent of mental states. This debate can be (and often\nhas been) traced back all the way to the Euthyphro, where\nSocrates considers whether what is pious is determined by what the\ngods love, or whether it\u2019s the other way around (see Berker\n2018; Wright 1992). This debate has come to be known as the debate\nover the mind-dependence of normativity. Normative realists\nhave generally been taken to be committed to mind-independence (see,\ne.g., Shafer-Landau 2003; McGrath 2010; Enoch 2011), although we have\nattempted to remain neutral on this point by distinguishing\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d from \u201cbasic\nrealism\u201d, which is compatible with mind-dependence (see Cuneo\n2007).\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll cover arguments for and against the\nmind-dependence of the normative. But before we get there, we need to\nanswer a framing question: what precisely are we talking\nabout when we talk about the mind-dependence of the normative?\nAbove we framed this as the question of whether normativity is\nexplained in terms of mental states. But as we\u2019ll see below,\nthat formulation is not entirely clear.\n",
