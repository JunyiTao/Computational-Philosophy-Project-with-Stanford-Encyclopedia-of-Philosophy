    "main_text": "Historical Background\n1. Historical Background\n\nPhilosophers who study the social character of scientific knowledge\ncan trace their lineage at least as far as John Stuart Mill. Mill,\nCharles Sanders Peirce, and Karl Popper all took some type of critical\ninteraction among persons as central to the validation of knowledge\nclaims.\n\nMill\u2019s arguments occur in his well-known political essay On\nLiberty, (Mill 1859) rather than in the context of his logical and\nmethodological writings, but he makes it clear that they are to apply\nto any kind of knowledge or truth claim. Mill argues from the\nfallibility of human knowers to the necessity of unobstructed\nopportunity for and practice of the critical discussion of ideas. Only\nsuch critical discussion can assure us of the justifiability of the\n(true) beliefs we do have and can help us avoid falsity or the\npartiality of belief or opinion framed in the context of just one\npoint of view. Critical interaction maintains the freshness of our\nreasons and is instrumental in the improvement of both the content and\nthe reasons of our beliefs. The achievement of knowledge, then, is a\nsocial or collective, not an individual, matter.\n\nPeirce\u2019s contribution to the social epistemology of science is\ncommonly taken to be his consensual theory of truth: \u201cThe\nopinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate is what we mean by truth, and the object represented is\nthe real.\u201d (Peirce 1878, 133) While often read as meaning that\nthe truth is whatever the community of inquirers converges on in the\nlong run, the notion is interpretable as meaning more precisely either\nthat truth (and \u201cthe real\u201d) depends on the agreement of\nthe community of inquirers or that it is an effect of the real that it\nwill in the end produce agreement among inquirers. Whatever the\ncorrect reading of this particular statement, Peirce elsewhere makes\nit clear that, in his view, truth is both attainable and beyond the\nreach of any individual. \u201cWe individually cannot hope to attain\nthe ultimate philosophy which we pursue; we can only seek it for the\ncommunity of philosophers.\u201d (Peirce 1868, 40). Peirce puts great\nstock in instigating doubt and critical interaction as means to\nknowledge. Thus, whether his theory of truth is consensualist or\nrealist, his view of the practices by which we attain it grants a\ncentral place to dialogue and social interaction.\n\nPopper is often treated as a precursor of social epistemology because\nof his emphasis on the importance of criticism in the development of\nscientific knowledge. Two concepts of criticism are found in his works\n(Popper 1963, 1972) and these can be described as logical and\npractical senses of falsification. The logical sense of falsification\nis just the structure of a modus tollens argument, in which a\nhypothesis is falsified by the demonstration that one of its logical\nconsequences is false. This is one notion of criticism, but it is a\nmatter of formal relations between statements. The practical sense of\nfalsification refers to the efforts of scientists to demonstrate the\ninadequacies of one another\u2019s theories by demonstrating\nobservational shortcomings or conceptual inconsistencies. This is a\nsocial activity. For Popper the methodology of science is\nfalsificationist in both its logical and practical senses, and science\nprogresses through the demonstration by falsification of the\nuntenability of theories and hypotheses. Popper\u2019s logical\nfalsificationism is part of an effort to demarcate genuine science\nfrom pseudo science, and has lost its plausibility as a description of\nscientific methodology as the demarcation project has come under\nchallenge from naturalist and historicist approaches in philosophy of\nscience. While criticism does play an important role in some current\napproaches in social epistemology, Popper\u2019s own views are more\nclosely approximated by evolutionary epistemology, especially that\nversion that treats cognitive progress as the effect of selection\nagainst incorrect theories and hypotheses. In contrast to Mill\u2019s\nviews, for Popper the function of criticism is to eliminate false\ntheories rather than to improve them.\n\nThe work of Mill, Peirce, and Popper is a resource for philosophers\npresently exploring the social dimensions of scientific knowledge.\nHowever, the current debates are framed in the context of developments\nin both philosophy of science and in history and social studies of\nscience following the collapse of the logical empiricist consensus.\nThe philosophers of the Vienna Circle are conventionally associated\nwith an uncritical form of positivism and with the logical empiricism\nthat replaced American pragmatism in the 1940s and 1950s. According to\nsome recent scholars, however, they saw natural science as a potent\nforce for progressive social change. (Cartwright, Cat, and Chang 1996;\nGiere and Richardson, eds., 1996; Uebel 2005) With its grounding in\nobservation and public forms of verification, science for them\nconstituted a superior alternative to what they saw as metaphysical\nobscurantism, an obscurantism that led not only to bad thinking but to\nbad politics. While one development of this point of view leads to\nscientism, the view that any meaningful question can be answered by\nthe methods of science; another development leads to inquiry into what\nsocial conditions promote the growth of scientific knowledge. Logical\nempiricism, the version of Vienna Circle philosophy that developed in\nthe United States, focused on logical, internal aspects of scientific\nknowledge and discouraged philosophical inquiry into the social\ndimensions of science. These came into prominence again after the\npublication of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions (Kuhn 1962). A new generation of sociologists of\nscience, among them Barry Barnes, Steven Shapin, and Harry Collins,\ntook Kuhn\u2019s emphasis on the role of non-evidential community\nfactors in scientific change even further than he had and argued that\nscientific judgment was determined by social factors, such as\nprofessional interests and political ideologies (Barnes 1977, Shapin\n1982, Collins 1983). This family of positions provoked a\ncounter-response among philosophers. These responses are marked by an\neffort to acknowledge some social dimensions to scientific knowledge\nwhile at the same time maintaining its epistemological legitimacy,\nwhich they take to be undermined by the new sociology. At the same\ntime, features of the organization of scientific inquiry compel\nphilosophers to consider their implications for the normative analysis\nof scientific practices.\n",
