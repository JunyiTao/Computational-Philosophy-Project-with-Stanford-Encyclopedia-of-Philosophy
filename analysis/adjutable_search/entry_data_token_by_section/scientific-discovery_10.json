    "main_text": "Methodologies of discovery || Discoverability\n8.1 Discoverability\n\nThe methodology of discovery has sometimes been characterized as a\nform of justification that is complementary to the methodology of\ntesting (Nickles 1984, 1985, 1989). According to the methodology of\ntesting, empirical support for a theory results from successfully\ntesting the predictive consequences derived from that theory (and\nappropriate auxiliary assumptions). In light of this methodology,\njustification for a theory is \u201cconsequential\njustification,\u201d the notion that a hypothesis is established if\nsuccessful novel predictions are derived from the theory or\nclaim. Generative justification complements consequential\njustification. Advocates of generative justification hold that there\nexists an important form of justification in science that involves\nreasoning to a claim from data or previously established\nresults more generally.\n\nOne classic example for a generative methodology is the set of\nNewton\u2019s rules for the study of natural philosophy. According to\nthese rules, general propositions are established by deducing them\nfrom the phenomena. The notion of generative justification seeks to\npreserve the intuition behind classic conceptions of justification by\ndeduction. Generative justification amounts to the rational\nreconstruction of the discovery path in order to establish its\ndiscoverability had the researchers known what is known now,\nregardless of how it was first thought of (Nickles 1985, 1989). The\nreconstruction demonstrates in hindsight that the claim could have\nbeen discovered in this manner had the necessary information and\ntechniques been available. In other words, generative\njustification\u2014justification as \u201cdiscoverability\u201d or\n\u201cpotential discovery\u201d\u2014justifies a knowledge claim by\nderiving it from results that are already established. While\ngenerative justification does not retrace exactly those steps of the\nactual discovery path that were actually taken, it is a better\nrepresentation of scientists\u2019 actual practices than\nconsequential justification because scientists tend to construe new\nclaims from available knowledge. Generative justification is a weaker\nversion of the traditional ideal of justification by deduction from\nthe phenomena. Justification by deduction from the phenomena is\ncomplete if a theory or claim is completely determined from what we\nalready know. The demonstration of discoverability results from the\nsuccessful derivation of a claim or theory from the most basic and\nmost solidly established empirical information.\n",
