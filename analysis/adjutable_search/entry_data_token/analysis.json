The \nexplanation or reconstruction is often then exhibited in a \ncorresponding process of synthesis. This allows great variation in \nspecific method, however.

General Introduction\n\n\nThis section provides a preliminary description of analysis\u2014or \nthe range of different conceptions of analysis\u2014and a guide to \nthis article as a whole.\n1.1 Characterizations of Analysis\n\n\nIf asked what \u2018analysis\u2019 means, most people today \nimmediately think of breaking something down into its components; and\nthis is how analysis tends to be officially characterized. In the \nConcise Oxford Dictionary, for example, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as the \u201cresolution into \nsimpler elements by analysing (opp. synthesis)\u201d, the \nonly other uses mentioned being the mathematical and the \npsychological \n [Quotation].\n And in the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as \u201cthe process of breaking a\nconcept down into more simple parts, so that its logical structure is\ndisplayed\u201d \n [Quotation].\n The restriction to concepts and the reference to displaying \n\u2018logical structure\u2019 are important qualifications, but the\ncore conception remains that of breaking something down.\n\n\nThis conception may be called the decompositional conception\nof analysis (see \n Section 4).\n But it is not the only conception, and indeed is arguably neither the\ndominant conception in the pre-modern period nor the conception that \nis characteristic of at least one major strand in \n\u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy. In ancient Greek thought, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 referred primarily to the process of working \nback to first principles by means of which something could then be \ndemonstrated. This conception may be called the regressive \nconception of analysis (see \n Section 2).\n In the work of Frege and Russell, on the other hand, before the \nprocess of decomposition could take place, the statements to be \nanalyzed had first to be translated into their \u2018correct\u2019 \nlogical form (see \n Section 6).\n This suggests that analysis also involves a transformative \nor interpretive dimension. This too, however, has its roots \nin earlier thought (see especially the supplementary sections on \n Ancient Greek Geometry\n and \n Medieval Philosophy).\n \n\n\nThese three conceptions should not be seen as competing. In actual \npractices of analysis, which are invariably richer than the accounts \nthat are offered of them, all three conceptions are typically \nreflected, though to differing degrees and in differing forms. To \nanalyze something, we may first have to interpret it in some way, \ntranslating an initial statement, say, into the privileged language \nof logic, mathematics or science, before articulating the relevant \nelements and structures, and all in the service of identifying \nfundamental principles by means of which to explain it. The \ncomplexities that this schematic description suggests can only be \nappreciated by considering particular types of analysis.\n\n\nUnderstanding conceptions of analysis is not simply a matter of \nattending to the use of the word \u2018analysis\u2019 and its \ncognates\u2014or obvious equivalents in languages other than \nEnglish, such as \u2018analusis\u2019 in Greek or \n\u2018Analyse\u2019 in German. Socratic definition is \narguably a form of conceptual analysis, yet the term \n\u2018analusis\u2019 does not occur anywhere in \nPlato's dialogues (see \n Section 2\n below). Nor, indeed, do we find it in Euclid's \nElements, which is the classic text for understanding \nancient Greek geometry: Euclid presupposed what came to be known as \nthe method of analysis in presenting his proofs \n\u2018synthetically\u2019. In Latin, \n\u2018resolutio\u2019 was used to render the Greek word \n\u2018analusis\u2019, and although \n\u2018resolution\u2019 has a different range of meanings, it is \noften used synonymously with \u2018analysis\u2019 (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Renaissance Philosophy).\n In Aristotelian syllogistic theory, and especially from the time of \nDescartes, forms of analysis have also involved \n\u2018reduction\u2019; and in early analytic philosophy it was \n\u2018reduction\u2019 that was seen as the goal of philosophical \nanalysis (see especially the supplementary section on \n The Cambridge School of Analysis).\n \n\n\nFurther details of characterizations of analysis that have been \noffered in the history of philosophy, including all the classic \npassages and remarks (to which occurrences of \n \u2018[Quotation]\u2019\n throughout this entry refer), can be found in the supplementary \ndocument on\nDefinitions and Descriptions of Analysis.\n\n\nA list of key reference works, monographs and collections can be \nfound in the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a71.\n1.2 Guide to this Entry\n\n\nThis entry comprises three sets of documents:\n\nThe present document\nSix supplementary documents (one of which is not yet\navailable)\nAn annotated bibliography on analysis, divided into six\ndocuments\n\n\n\nThe present document provides an overview, with introductions to the \nvarious conceptions of analysis in the history of philosophy. It also\ncontains links to the supplementary documents, the documents in the \nbibliography, and other internet resources. The supplementary \ndocuments expand on certain topics under each of the six main \nsections. The annotated bibliography contains a list of key readings \non each topic, and is also divided according to the sections of this \nentry.\n2. Ancient Conceptions of Analysis and the Emergence of the Regressive Conception\n\n\nThe word \u2018analysis\u2019 derives from the ancient Greek term \n\u2018analusis\u2019. The prefix \n\u2018ana\u2019 means \u2018up\u2019, and \n\u2018lusis\u2019 means \u2018loosing\u2019, \n\u2018release\u2019 or \u2018separation\u2019, so that \n\u2018analusis\u2019 means \u2018loosening up\u2019 or \n\u2018dissolution\u2019. The term was readily extended to the \nsolving or dissolving of a problem, and it was in this sense that it \nwas employed in ancient Greek geometry and philosophy. The method of \nanalysis that was developed in ancient Greek geometry had an \ninfluence on both Plato and Aristotle. Also important, however, was \nthe influence of Socrates's concern with definition, in which \nthe roots of modern conceptual analysis can be found. What we have in\nancient Greek thought, then, is a complex web of methodologies, of \nwhich the most important are Socratic definition, which Plato \nelaborated into his method of division, his related method of \nhypothesis, which drew on geometrical analysis, and the method(s) \nthat Aristotle developed in his Analytics. Far from a \nconsensus having established itself over the last two millennia, the \nrelationships between these methodologies are the subject of \nincreasing debate today. At the heart of all of them, too, lie the \nphilosophical problems raised by Meno's paradox, which \nanticipates what we now know as the paradox of analysis, concerning \nhow an analysis can be both correct and informative (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Moore),\n and Plato's attempt to solve it through the theory of \nrecollection, which has spawned a vast literature on its own.\n\n\n\u2018Analysis\u2019 was first used in a methodological sense in \nancient Greek geometry, and the model that Euclidean geometry \nprovided has been an inspiration ever since. Although Euclid's \nElements dates from around 300 BC, and hence after both \nPlato and Aristotle, it is clear that it draws on the work of many \nprevious geometers, most notably, Theaetetus and Eudoxus, who worked \nclosely with Plato and Aristotle. Plato is even credited by Diogenes \nLaertius (LEP, I, 299) with inventing the method of \nanalysis, but whatever the truth of this may be, the influence of \ngeometry starts to show in his middle dialogues, and he certainly \nencouraged work on geometry in his Academy.\n\n\nThe classic source for our understanding of ancient Greek geometrical\nanalysis is a passage in Pappus's Mathematical \nCollection, which was composed around 300 AD, and hence drew on \na further six centuries of work in geometry from the time of \nEuclid's Elements:\nNow analysis is the way from what is sought\u2014as if it\nwere admitted\u2014through its concomitants (akolouth\u00f4n)\nin order[,] to something admitted in synthesis. For in analysis we suppose\nthat which is sought to be already done, and we inquire from what it\nresults, and again what is the antecedent of the latter, until we on\nour backward way light upon something already known and being first in\norder. And we call such a method analysis, as being a solution\nbackwards (anapalin lysin). \n\n\n\nIn synthesis, on the other hand, we suppose that which was reached \nlast in analysis to be already done, and arranging in their natural \norder as consequents (epomena) the former antecedents and \nlinking them one with another, we in the end arrive at the \nconstruction of the thing sought. And this we call synthesis. \n [Full Quotation]\n \n\n\n\nAnalysis is clearly being understood here in the regressive \nsense\u2014as involving the working back from \u2018what is \nsought\u2019, taken as assumed, to something more fundamental by \nmeans of which it can then be established, through its converse, \nsynthesis. For example, to demonstrate Pythagoras's \ntheorem\u2014that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled \ntriangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two \nsides\u2014we may assume as \u2018given\u2019 a right-angled triangle with the\nthree squares drawn on its sides. In investigating the properties of \nthis complex figure we may draw further (auxiliary) lines between \nparticular points and find that there are a number of congruent \ntriangles, from which we can begin to work out the relationship \nbetween the relevant areas. Pythagoras's theorem thus depends \non theorems about congruent triangles, and once these\u2014and \nother\u2014theorems have been identified (and themselves proved), \nPythagoras's theorem can be proved. (The theorem is \ndemonstrated in Proposition 47 of Book I of Euclid's \nElements.)\n\n\nThe basic idea here provides the core of the conception of analysis \nthat one can find reflected, in its different ways, in the work of \nPlato and Aristotle (see the supplementary sections on \n Plato\n and \n Aristotle).\n Although detailed examination of actual practices of analysis reveals\nmore than just regression to first causes, principles or theorems, \nbut decomposition and transformation as well (see \nespecially the supplementary section on \n Ancient Greek Geometry),\n the regressive conception dominated views of analysis until well into\nthe early modern period.\n\n\nAncient Greek geometry was not the only source of later conceptions \nof analysis, however. Plato may not have used the term \n\u2018analysis\u2019 himself, but concern with definition was \ncentral to his dialogues, and definitions have often been seen as \nwhat \u2018conceptual analysis\u2019 should yield. The definition \nof \u2018knowledge\u2019 as \u2018justified true belief\u2019 (or\n\u2018true belief with an account\u2019, in more Platonic terms) is\nperhaps the classic example. Plato's concern may have been with\nreal rather than nominal definitions, with \u2018essences\u2019 \nrather than mental or linguistic contents (see the supplementary \nsection on \n Plato),\n but conceptual analysis, too, has frequently been given a \n\u2018realist\u2019 construal. Certainly, the roots of conceptual \nanalysis can be traced back to Plato's search for definitions, \nas we shall see in \n Section 4\n below.\n\n\nFurther discussion can be found in the supplementary document on\nAncient Conceptions of Analysis.\n\n\nFurther reading can be found in the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a72.\n3. Medieval and Renaissance Conceptions of Analysis\n\n\nConceptions of analysis in the medieval and renaissance periods were \nlargely influenced by ancient Greek conceptions. But knowledge of \nthese conceptions was often second-hand, filtered through a variety \nof commentaries and texts that were not always reliable. Medieval and\nrenaissance methodologies tended to be uneasy mixtures of Platonic, \nAristotelian, Stoic, Galenic and neo-Platonic elements, many of them \nclaiming to have some root in the geometrical conception of analysis \nand synthesis. However, in the late medieval period, clearer and more\noriginal forms of analysis started to take shape. In the literature \non so-called \u2018syncategoremata\u2019 and \n\u2018exponibilia\u2019, for example, we can trace the development \nof a conception of interpretive analysis. Sentences involving more \nthan one quantifier such as \u2018Some donkey every man sees\u2019,\nfor example, were recognized as ambiguous, requiring \n\u2018exposition\u2019 to clarify.\n\n\nIn John Buridan's masterpiece of the mid-fourteenth century, \nthe Summulae de Dialectica, we can find all three of the \nconceptions outlined in \n Section 1.1\n above. He distinguishes explicitly between divisions, definitions and\ndemonstrations, corresponding to decompositional, interpretive and \nregressive analysis, respectively. Here, in particular, we have \nanticipations of modern analytic philosophy as much as reworkings of \nancient philosophy. Unfortunately, however, these clearer forms of \nanalysis became overshadowed during the Renaissance, despite\u2014or\nperhaps because of\u2014the growing interest in the original Greek \nsources. As far as understanding analytic methodologies was \nconcerned, the humanist repudiation of scholastic logic muddied the \nwaters.\n\n\nFurther discussion can be found in the supplementary document on\nMedieval and Renaissance Conceptions of Analysis.\n\n\nFurther reading can be found in the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a73.\n4. Early Modern Conceptions of Analysis and the Development of the Decompositional Conception\n\n\nThe scientific revolution in the seventeenth century brought with it \nnew forms of analysis. The newest of these emerged through the \ndevelopment of more sophisticated mathematical techniques, but even \nthese still had their roots in earlier conceptions of analysis. By \nthe end of the early modern period, decompositional analysis had \nbecome dominant (as outlined in what follows), but this, too, took \ndifferent forms, and the relationships between the various \nconceptions of analysis were often far from clear.\n\n\nIn common with the Renaissance, the early modern period was marked by\na great concern with methodology. This might seem unsurprising in \nsuch a revolutionary period, when new techniques for understanding \nthe world were being developed and that understanding itself was \nbeing transformed. But what characterizes many of the treatises and \nremarks on methodology that appeared in the seventeenth century is \ntheir appeal, frequently self-conscious, to ancient methods (despite,\nor perhaps\u2014for diplomatic reasons\u2014because of, the \ncritique of the content of traditional thought), although \nnew wine was generally poured into the old bottles. The model of \ngeometrical analysis was a particular inspiration here, albeit \nfiltered through the Aristotelian tradition, which had assimilated \nthe regressive process of going from theorems to axioms with that of \nmoving from effects to causes (see the supplementary section on \n Aristotle).\n Analysis came to be seen as a method of discovery, working back from \nwhat is ordinarily known to the underlying reasons (demonstrating \n\u2018the fact\u2019), and synthesis as a method of proof, working \nforwards again from what is discovered to what needed explanation \n(demonstrating \u2018the reason why\u2019). Analysis and synthesis \nwere thus taken as complementary, although there remained \ndisagreement over their respective merits.\n\n\nThere is a manuscript by Galileo, dating from around 1589, an \nappropriated commentary on Aristotle's Posterior \nAnalytics, which shows his concern with methodology, and \nregressive analysis, in particular (see Wallace 1992a and 1992b). \nHobbes wrote a chapter on method in the first part of De \nCorpore, published in 1655, which offers his own interpretation \nof the method of analysis and synthesis, where decompositional forms \nof analysis are articulated alongside regressive forms \n [Quotations].\n But perhaps the most influential account of methodology, from the \nmiddle of the seventeenth century until well into the nineteenth \ncentury, was the fourth part of the Port-Royal Logic, the \nfirst edition of which appeared in 1662 and the final revised edition\nin 1683. Chapter 2 (which was the first chapter in the first edition)\nopens as follows:\nThe art of arranging a series of thoughts properly, either\nfor discovering the truth when we do not know it, or for proving to\nothers what we already know, can generally be called method. \n\n\n\nHence there are two kinds of method, one for discovering the truth, \nwhich is known as analysis, or the method of \nresolution, and which can also be called the method of \ndiscovery. The other is for making the truth understood by \nothers once it is found. This is known as synthesis, or the \nmethod of composition, and can also be called the method\nof instruction. \n [Fuller Quotations]\n \n\n\n\nThat a number of different methods might be assimilated here is not \nnoted, although the text does go on to distinguish four main types of\n\u2018issues concerning things\u2019: seeking causes by their \neffects, seeking effects by their causes, finding the whole from the \nparts, and looking for another part from the whole and a given part \n(ibid., 234). While the first two involve regressive \nanalysis and synthesis, the third and fourth involve decompositional \nanalysis and synthesis.\n\n\nAs the authors of the Logic make clear, this particular part\nof their text derives from Descartes's Rules for the \nDirection of the Mind, written around 1627, but only published \nposthumously in 1684. The specification of the four types was most \nlikely offered in elaborating Descartes's Rule Thirteen, which \nstates: \u201cIf we perfectly understand a problem we must abstract \nit from every superfluous conception, reduce it to its simplest terms\nand, by means of an enumeration, divide it up into the smallest \npossible parts.\u201d (PW, I, 51. Cf. the editorial \ncomments in PW, I, 54, 77.) The decompositional conception \nof analysis is explicit here, and if we follow this up into the later\nDiscourse on Method, published in 1637, the focus has \nclearly shifted from the regressive to the decompositional conception\nof analysis. All the rules offered in the earlier work have now been \nreduced to just four. This is how Descartes reports the rules he says\nhe adopted in his scientific and philosophical work:\nThe first was never to accept anything as true if I did not\nhave evident knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid\nprecipitate conclusions and preconceptions, and to include nothing more\nin my judgements than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and\nso distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it. \n\n\n\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties I examined into as \nmany parts as possible and as may be required in order to resolve \nthem better.\n\n\nThe third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by beginning \nwith the simplest and most easily known objects in the order to \nascend little by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most \ncomplex, and by supposing some order even among objects that have no \nnatural order of precedence.\n\n\nAnd the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and \nreviews so comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing \nout. (PW, I, 120.)\n\n\n\nThe first two are rules of analysis and the second two rules of \nsynthesis. But although the analysis/synthesis structure remains, \nwhat is involved here is decomposition/composition rather than \nregression/progression. Nevertheless, Descartes insisted that it was \ngeometry that influenced him here: \u201cThose long chains composed \nof very simple and easy reasonings, which geometers customarily use \nto arrive at their most difficult demonstrations, had given me \noccasion to suppose that all the things which can fall under human \nknowledge are interconnected in the same way.\u201d (Ibid. \n [Further Quotations])\n \n\n\nDescartes's geometry did indeed involve the breaking down of \ncomplex problems into simpler ones. More significant, however, was \nhis use of algebra in developing \u2018analytic\u2019 geometry as \nit came to be called, which allowed geometrical problems to be \ntransformed into arithmetical ones and more easily solved. In \nrepresenting the \u2018unknown\u2019 to be found by \n\u2018x\u2019, we can see the central role played in \nanalysis by the idea of taking something as \u2018given\u2019 and \nworking back from that, which made it seem appropriate to regard \nalgebra as an \u2018art of analysis\u2019, alluding to the \nregressive conception of the ancients. Illustrated in analytic \ngeometry in its developed form, then, we can see all three of the \nconceptions of analysis outlined in \n Section 1.1\n above, despite Descartes's own emphasis on the decompositional \nconception. For further discussion of this, see the supplementary \nsection on \n Descartes and Analytic Geometry.\n \n\n\nDescartes's emphasis on decompositional analysis was not \nwithout precedents, however. Not only was it already involved in \nancient Greek geometry, but it was also implicit in Plato's \nmethod of collection and division. We might explain the shift from \nregressive to decompositional (conceptual) analysis, as well as the \nconnection between the two, in the following way. Consider a simple \nexample, as represented in the diagram below, \n\u2018collecting\u2019 all animals and \u2018dividing\u2019 them \ninto rational and non-rational, in order to define \nhuman beings as rational animals.\n\n\n\nOn this model, in seeking to define anything, we work back up the \nappropriate classificatory hierarchy to find the higher (i.e., more \nbasic or more general) \u2018Forms\u2019, by means of which we can \nlay down the definition. Although Plato did not himself use the term \n\u2018analysis\u2019\u2014the word for \u2018division\u2019 was \n\u2018dihairesis\u2019\u2014the finding of the \nappropriate \u2018Forms\u2019 is essentially analysis. As an \nelaboration of the Socratic search for definitions, we clearly have \nin this the origins of conceptual analysis. There is little \ndisagreement that \u2018Human beings are rational animals\u2019 is \nthe kind of definition we are seeking, defining one concept, the \nconcept human being, in terms of other concepts, the \nconcepts rational and animal. But the construals \nthat have been offered of this have been more problematic. \nUnderstanding a classificatory hierarchy extensionally, that\nis, in terms of the classes of things denoted, the classes higher up \nare clearly the larger, \u2018containing\u2019 the classes lower \ndown as subclasses (e.g., the class of animals includes the class of \nhuman beings as one of its subclasses). Intensionally, \nhowever, the relationship of \u2018containment\u2019 has been seen \nas holding in the opposite direction. If someone understands the \nconcept human being, at least in the strong sense of knowing\nits definition, then they must understand the concepts \nanimal and rational; and it has often then seemed \nnatural to talk of the concept human being as \n\u2018containing\u2019 the concepts rational and \nanimal. Working back up the hierarchy in \n\u2018analysis\u2019 (in the regressive sense) could then come to \nbe identified with \u2018unpacking\u2019 or \n\u2018decomposing\u2019 a concept into its \n\u2018constituent\u2019 concepts (\u2018analysis\u2019 in the \ndecompositional sense). Of course, talking of \n\u2018decomposing\u2019 a concept into its \n\u2018constituents\u2019 is, strictly speaking, only a metaphor (as\nQuine was famously to remark in \u00a71 of \u2018Two Dogmas of \nEmpiricism\u2019), but in the early modern period, this began to be \ntaken more literally.\n\n\nFor further discussion, see the supplementary document on\nEarly Modern Conceptions of Analysis,\n\n\nwhich contains sections on Descartes and Analytic Geometry, British \nEmpiricism, Leibniz, and Kant.\n\n\nFor further reading, see the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a74.\n5. Modern Conceptions of Analysis, outside Analytic Philosophy\n\n\nAs suggested in the supplementary document on \n Kant,\n the decompositional conception of analysis found its classic \nstatement in the work of Kant at the end of the eighteenth century. \nBut Kant was only expressing a conception widespread at the time. The\nconception can be found in a very blatant form, for example, in the \nwritings of Moses Mendelssohn, for whom, unlike Kant, it was \napplicable even in the case of geometry \n [Quotation].\n Typified in Kant's and Mendelssohn's view of concepts, it\nwas also reflected in scientific practice. Indeed, its popularity was\nfostered by the chemical revolution inaugurated by Lavoisier in the \nlate eighteenth century, the comparison between philosophical \nanalysis and chemical analysis being frequently drawn. As Lichtenberg\nput it, \u201cWhichever way you look at it, philosophy is always \nanalytical chemistry\u201d \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nThis decompositional conception of analysis set the methodological \nagenda for philosophical approaches and debates in the (late) modern \nperiod (nineteenth and twentieth centuries). Responses and \ndevelopments, very broadly, can be divided into two. On the one hand,\nan essentially decompositional conception of analysis was accepted, \nbut a critical attitude was adopted towards it. If analysis simply \ninvolved breaking something down, then it appeared destructive and \nlife-diminishing, and the critique of analysis that this view \nengendered was a common theme in idealism and romanticism in all its \nmain varieties\u2014from German, British and French to North \nAmerican. One finds it reflected, for example, in remarks about the \nnegating and soul-destroying power of analytical thinking by Schiller\n\n [Quotation],\n Hegel \n [Quotation]\n and de Chardin \n [Quotation],\n in Bradley's doctrine that analysis is falsification \n [Quotation],\n and in the emphasis placed by Bergson on \u2018intuition\u2019 \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nOn the other hand, analysis was seen more positively, but the Kantian\nconception underwent a certain degree of modification and \ndevelopment. In the nineteenth century, this was exemplified, in \nparticular, by Bolzano and the neo-Kantians. Bolzano's most \nimportant innovation was the method of variation, which involves \nconsidering what happens to the truth-value of a sentence when a \nconstituent term is substituted by another. This formed the basis for\nhis reconstruction of the analytic/synthetic distinction, \nKant's account of which he found defective. The neo-Kantians \nemphasized the role of structure in conceptualized experience and had\na greater appreciation of forms of analysis in mathematics and \nscience. In many ways, their work attempts to do justice to \nphilosophical and scientific practice while recognizing the central \nidealist claim that analysis is a kind of abstraction that inevitably\ninvolves falsification or distortion. On the neo-Kantian view, the \ncomplexity of experience is a complexity of form and content rather \nthan of separable constituents, requiring analysis into \n\u2018moments\u2019 or \u2018aspects\u2019 rather than \n\u2018elements\u2019 or \u2018parts\u2019. In the 1910s, the idea\nwas articulated with great subtlety by Ernst Cassirer \n [Quotation],\n and became familiar in Gestalt psychology.\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, both analytic philosophy and phenomenology \ncan be seen as developing far more sophisticated conceptions of \nanalysis, which draw on but go beyond mere decompositional analysis. \nThe following \n Section\n offers an account of analysis in analytic philosophy, illustrating \nthe range and richness of the conceptions and practices that arose. \nBut it is important to see these in the wider context of \ntwentieth-century methodological practices and debates, for it is not\njust in \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy\u2014despite its \nname\u2014that analytic methods are accorded a central role. \nPhenomenology, in particular, contains its own distinctive set of \nanalytic methods, with similarities and differences to those of \nanalytic philosophy. Phenomenological analysis has frequently been \ncompared to conceptual clarification in the ordinary language \ntradition, for example, and the method of \u2018phenomenological \nreduction\u2019 that Husserl invented in 1905 offers a striking \nparallel to the reductive project opened up by Russell's theory\nof descriptions, which also made its appearance in 1905.\n\n\nJust like Frege and Russell, Husserl's initial concern was with\nthe foundations of mathematics, and in this shared concern we can see\nthe continued influence of the regressive conception of analysis. \nAccording to Husserl, the aim of \u2018eidetic reduction\u2019, as \nhe called it, was to isolate the \u2018essences\u2019 that underlie\nour various forms of thinking, and to apprehend them by \n\u2018essential intuition\u2019 \n(\u2018Wesenserschauung\u2019). The terminology may be \ndifferent, but this resembles Russell's early project to \nidentify the \u2018indefinables\u2019 of philosophical logic, as he\ndescribed it, and to apprehend them by \u2018acquaintance\u2019 \n(cf. POM, xx). Furthermore, in Husserl's later \ndiscussion of \u2018explication\u2019 (cf. EJ, \n\u00a7\u00a7 22-4 \n [Quotations]),\n we find appreciation of the \u2018transformative\u2019 dimension of\nanalysis, which can be fruitfully compared with Carnap's \naccount of explication (see the supplementary section on \n Carnap and Logical Positivism).\n Carnap himself describes Husserl's idea here as one of \n\u201cthe synthesis of identification between a confused, \nnonarticulated sense and a subsequently intended distinct, \narticulated sense\u201d (1950, 3 \n [Quotation]).\n \n\n\nPhenomenology is not the only source of analytic methodologies \noutside those of the analytic tradition. Mention might be made here, \ntoo, of R. G. Collingwood, working within the tradition of British \nidealism, which was still a powerful force prior to the Second World \nWar. In his Essay on Philosophical Method (1933), for \nexample, he criticizes Moorean philosophy, and develops his own \nresponse to what is essentially the paradox of analysis (concerning \nhow an analysis can be both correct and informative), which he \nrecognizes as having its root in Meno's paradox. In his \nEssay on Metaphysics (1940), he puts forward his own \nconception of metaphysical analysis, in direct response to what he \nperceived as the mistaken repudiation of metaphysics by the logical \npositivists. Metaphysical analysis is characterized here as the \ndetection of \u2018absolute presuppositions\u2019, which are taken \nas underlying and shaping the various conceptual practices that can \nbe identified in the history of philosophy and science. Even among \nthose explicitly critical of central strands in analytic philosophy, \nthen, analysis in one form or another can still be seen as alive and \nwell.\n\nFor further reading, see the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a75.\n6. Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy and the Introduction of the Logical (Transformative) Conception\n\n\nIf anything characterizes \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy, then it \nis presumably the emphasis placed on analysis. But as the foregoing \nsections have shown, there is a wide range of conceptions of \nanalysis, so such a characterization says nothing that would \ndistinguish analytic philosophy from much of what has either preceded\nor developed alongside it. Given that the decompositional conception \nis usually offered as the main conception today, it might be thought \nthat it is this that characterizes analytic philosophy. But this \nconception was prevalent in the early modern period, shared by both \nthe British Empiricists and Leibniz, for example. Given that Kant \ndenied the importance of decompositional analysis, however, it might \nbe suggested that what characterizes analytic philosophy is the \nvalue it places on such analysis. This might be true of \nMoore's early work, and of one strand within analytic \nphilosophy; but it is not generally true. What characterizes analytic\nphilosophy as it was founded by Frege and Russell is the role played \nby logical analysis, which depended on the development of \nmodern logic. Although other and subsequent forms of analysis, such \nas linguistic analysis, were less wedded to systems of formal logic, \nthe central insight motivating logical analysis remained.\n\n\nPappus's account of method in ancient Greek geometry suggests \nthat the regressive conception of analysis was dominant at the \ntime\u2014however much other conceptions may also have been \nimplicitly involved (see the supplementary section on \n Ancient Greek Geometry).\n In the early modern period, the decompositional conception became \nwidespread (see \n Section 4).\n What characterizes analytic philosophy\u2014or at least that central\nstrand that originates in the work of Frege and Russell\u2014is the \nrecognition of what was called earlier the transformative or\ninterpretive dimension of analysis (see \n Section 1.1).\n Any analysis presupposes a particular framework of interpretation, \nand work is done in interpreting what we are seeking to \nanalyze as part of the process of regression and decomposition. This \nmay involve transforming it in some way, in order for the \nresources of a given theory or conceptual framework to be brought to \nbear. Euclidean geometry provides a good illustration of this. But it\nis even more obvious in the case of analytic geometry, where the \ngeometrical problem is first \u2018translated\u2019 into the \nlanguage of algebra and arithmetic in order to solve it more easily \n(see the supplementary section on \n Descartes and Analytic Geometry).\n What Descartes and Fermat did for analytic geometry, Frege and \nRussell did for analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is \n\u2018analytic\u2019 much more in the sense that analytic geometry \nis \u2018analytic\u2019 than in the crude decompositional sense \nthat Kant understood it.\n\n\nThe interpretive dimension of modern philosophical analysis can also \nbe seen as anticipated in medieval scholasticism (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Medieval Philosophy),\n and it is remarkable just how much of modern concerns with \npropositions, meaning, reference, and so on, can be found in the \nmedieval literature. Interpretive analysis is also illustrated in the\nnineteenth century by Bentham's conception of \nparaphrasis, which he characterized as \u201cthat sort of \nexposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, \nhaving for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not \nfor its subject any other than a fictitious entity\u201d \n [Full Quotation].\n He applied the idea in \u2018analyzing away\u2019 talk of \n\u2018obligations\u2019, and the anticipation that we can see here \nof Russell's theory of descriptions has been noted by, among \nothers, Wisdom (1931) and Quine in \u2018Five Milestones of \nEmpiricism\u2019 \n [Quotation].\n \n\n\nWhat was crucial in the emergence of twentieth-century analytic \nphilosophy, however, was the development of quantificational theory, \nwhich provided a far more powerful interpretive system than anything \nthat had hitherto been available. In the case of Frege and Russell, \nthe system into which statements were \u2018translated\u2019 was \npredicate logic, and the divergence that was thereby opened up \nbetween grammatical and logical form meant that the process of \ntranslation itself became an issue of philosophical concern. This \ninduced greater self-consciousness about our use of language and its \npotential to mislead us, and inevitably raised semantic, \nepistemological and metaphysical questions about the relationships \nbetween language, logic, thought and reality which have been at the \ncore of analytic philosophy ever since.\n\n\nBoth Frege and Russell (after the latter's initial flirtation \nwith idealism) were concerned to show, against Kant, that arithmetic \nis a system of analytic and not synthetic truths. In the \nGrundlagen, Frege had offered a revised conception of \nanalyticity, which arguably endorses and generalizes Kant's \nlogical as opposed to phenomenological criterion, i.e., (ANL) rather than (ANO) (see the\nsupplementary section on \n Kant):\n \n(AN) A truth is analytic if its proof depends only\non general logical laws and definitions.\n\n\nThe question of whether arithmetical truths are analytic then comes \ndown to the question of whether they can be derived purely logically.\n(Here we already have \u2018transformation\u2019, at the \ntheoretical level\u2014involving a reinterpretation of the concept \nof analyticity.) To demonstrate this, Frege realized that he needed \nto develop logical theory in order to formalize mathematical \nstatements, which typically involve multiple generality (e.g., \n\u2018Every natural number has a successor\u2019, i.e. \u2018For \nevery natural number x there is another natural number \ny that is the successor of x\u2019). This \ndevelopment, by extending the use of function-argument analysis in \nmathematics to logic and providing a notation for quantification, was\nessentially the achievement of his first book, the \nBegriffsschrift (1879), where he not only created the first \nsystem of predicate logic but also, using it, succeeded in giving a \nlogical analysis of mathematical induction (see Frege FR, \n47-78).\n\n\nIn his second book, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (1884), \nFrege went on to provide a logical analysis of number statements. His\ncentral idea was that a number statement contains an assertion about \na concept. A statement such as \u2018Jupiter has four moons\u2019 \nis to be understood not as predicating of Jupiter the property of \nhaving four moons, but as predicating of the concept moon of \nJupiter the second-level property has four instances, \nwhich can be logically defined. The significance of this construal \ncan be brought out by considering negative existential statements \n(which are equivalent to number statements involving the number 0). \nTake the following negative existential statement:\n(0a) Unicorns do not exist.\n\n\nIf we attempt to analyze this decompositionally, taking its \ngrammatical form to mirror its logical form, then we find ourselves \nasking what these unicorns are that have the property of \nnon-existence. We may then be forced to posit the \nsubsistence\u2014as opposed to existence\u2014of \nunicorns, just as Meinong and the early Russell did, in order for \nthere to be something that is the subject of our statement. On the \nFregean account, however, to deny that something exists is to say \nthat the relevant concept has no instances: there is no need\nto posit any mysterious object. The Fregean analysis of (0a)\nconsists in rephrasing it into (0b), which can then be \nreadily formalized in the new logic as (0c):\n(0b) The concept unicorn is not instantiated. \n\n\n\n(0c) ~(\u2203x) Fx.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, to say that God exists is to say that the concept \nGod is (uniquely) instantiated, i.e., to deny that the \nconcept has 0 instances (or 2 or more instances). On this view, \nexistence is no longer seen as a (first-level) predicate, but \ninstead, existential statements are analyzed in terms of the \n(second-level) predicate is instantiated, represented by \nmeans of the existential quantifier. As Frege notes, this offers a \nneat diagnosis of what is wrong with the ontological argument, at \nleast in its traditional form (GL, \u00a753). All the \nproblems that arise if we try to apply decompositional analysis (at \nleast straight off) simply drop away, although an account is still \nneeded, of course, of concepts and quantifiers.\n\n\nThe possibilities that this strategy of \u2018translating\u2019 \ninto a logical language opens up are enormous: we are no longer \nforced to treat the surface grammatical form of a statement as a \nguide to its \u2018real\u2019 form, and are provided with a means \nof representing that form. This is the value of logical analysis: it \nallows us to \u2018analyze away\u2019 problematic linguistic \nexpressions and explain what it is \u2018really\u2019 going on. \nThis strategy was employed, most famously, in Russell's theory \nof descriptions, which was a major motivation behind the ideas of \nWittgenstein's Tractatus (see the supplementary \nsections on \n Russell\n and \n Wittgenstein).\n Although subsequent philosophers were to question the assumption that\nthere could ever be a definitive logical analysis of a given \nstatement, the idea that ordinary language may be systematically \nmisleading has remained.\n\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following examples from Ryle's\nclassic 1932 paper, \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019:\n(Ua) Unpunctuality is reprehensible. \n\n\n\n(Ta) Jones hates the thought of going to hospital.\n\n\n\nIn each case, we might be tempted to make unnecessary reifications, \ntaking \u2018unpunctuality\u2019 and \u2018the thought of going to\nhospital\u2019 as referring to objects. It is because of this that \nRyle describes such expressions as \u2018systematically \nmisleading\u2019. (Ua) and (Ta) must therefore be rephrased:\n(Ub) Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people\nshould reprove him for being unpunctual. \n\n\n\n(Tb) Jones feels distressed when he thinks of what he will undergo if\nhe goes to hospital.\n\n\n\nIn these formulations, there is no overt talk at all of \n\u2018unpunctuality\u2019 or \u2018thoughts\u2019, and hence \nnothing to tempt us to posit the existence of any corresponding \nentities. The problems that otherwise arise have thus been \n\u2018analyzed away\u2019.\n\n\nAt the time that Ryle wrote \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019, he, too, assumed that every statement had an \nunderlying logical form that was to be exhibited in its \n\u2018correct\u2019 formulation \n [Quotations].\n But when he gave up this assumption (for reasons indicated in the \nsupplementary section on \n The Cambridge School of Analysis),\n he did not give up the motivating idea of logical analysis\u2014to \nshow what is wrong with misleading expressions. In The Concept of\nMind (1949), for example, he sought to explain what he called \nthe \u2018category-mistake\u2019 involved in talk of the mind as a \nkind of \u2018Ghost in the Machine\u2019. His aim, he wrote, was to\n\u201crectify the logical geography of the knowledge which we \nalready possess\u201d (1949, 9), an idea that was to lead to the \narticulation of connective rather than reductive \nconceptions of analysis, the emphasis being placed on elucidating the\nrelationships between concepts without assuming that there is a \nprivileged set of intrinsically basic concepts (see the supplementary\nsection on \n Oxford Linguistic Philosophy).\n \n\n\nWhat these various forms of logical analysis suggest, then, is that \nwhat characterizes analysis in analytic philosophy is something far \nricher than the mere \u2018decomposition\u2019 of a concept into \nits \u2018constituents\u2019. But this is not to say that the \ndecompositional conception of analysis plays no role at all. It can \nbe found in the early work of Moore, for example (see the \nsupplementary section on \n Moore).\n It might also be seen as reflected in the approach to the analysis of\nconcepts that seeks to specify the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for their correct employment. Conceptual analysis in this \nsense goes back to the Socrates of Plato's early dialogues (see\nthe supplementary section on \n Plato).\n But it arguably reached its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. As \nmentioned in \n Section 2\n above, the definition of \u2018knowledge\u2019 as \u2018justified \ntrue belief\u2019 is perhaps the most famous example; and this \ndefinition was criticised in Gettier's classic paper of 1963. \n(For details of this, see the entry in this Encyclopedia on \n The Analysis of Knowledge.)\n The specification of necessary and sufficient conditions may no \nlonger be seen as the primary aim of conceptual analysis, especially \nin the case of philosophical concepts such as \n\u2018knowledge\u2019, which are fiercely contested; but \nconsideration of such conditions remains a useful tool in the \nanalytic philosopher's toolbag.\n\n\nFor a more detailed account of the these and related conceptions of \nanalysis, see the supplementary document on\nConceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy.\n\n\nFor further reading, see the\nAnnotated Bibliography, \u00a76.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nThe history of philosophy reveals a rich source of conceptions of \nanalysis. Their origin may lie in ancient Greek geometry, and to this\nextent the history of analytic methodologies might be seen as a \nseries of footnotes to Euclid. But analysis developed in different \nthough related ways in the two traditions stemming from Plato and \nAristotle, the former based on the search for definitions and the \nlatter on the idea of regression to first causes. The two poles \nrepresented in these traditions defined methodological space until \nwell into the early modern period, and in some sense is still \nreflected today. The creation of analytic geometry in the seventeenth\ncentury introduced a more reductive form of analysis, and an \nanalogous and even more powerful form was introduced around the turn \nof the twentieth century in the logical work of Frege and Russell. \nAlthough conceptual analysis, construed decompositionally from the \ntime of Leibniz and Kant, and mediated by the work of Moore, is often\nviewed as characteristic of analytic philosophy, logical analysis, \ntaken as involving translation into a logical system, is what \ninaugurated the analytic tradition. Analysis has also frequently been\nseen as reductive, but connective forms of analysis are no less \nimportant. Connective analysis, historically inflected, would seem to\nbe particularly appropriate, for example, in understanding analysis \nitself.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Baker, Gordon, 2004, <em>Wittgenstein's Method</em>, Oxford:\nBlackwell, especially essays 1, 3, 4, 10, 12", "Baldwin, Thomas, 1990, <em>G.E.
