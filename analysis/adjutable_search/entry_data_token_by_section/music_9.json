People, by contrast, can\nunderstand the music they hear. What constitutes this\nexperience of understanding music? To use an analogy, while the mere\nsound of a piece of music might be represented by a sonogram,\nour experience of it as music is better represented by\nsomething like a marked-up score. We hear individual notes that make\nup distinct melodies, harmonies, rhythms, sections, and so on, and the\ninteraction between these elements. Such musical understanding comes\nin degrees along a number of dimensions. Your understanding of a given\npiece or style may be deeper than mine, while the reverse is true for\nanother piece or style. My general musical understanding may be\nnarrow, in the sense that I only understand one kind of music, while\nyou understand many different kinds (Budd 1985b: 233\u20135; S.\nDavies 2011c: 88\u201395). Moreover, different pieces or kinds of\npieces may call on different abilities, since some music has no\nharmony to speak of, some no melody, and so on. Many argue that, in\naddition to purely musical features, understanding the emotions\nexpressed in a piece is essential to adequately understanding it\n(e.g., Ridley 1993; S. Davies 1994; Levinson 1990d: 30; Scruton 1997;\nRobinson 2005: 348\u201378).\n\nAt the base of the musical experience seem to be (i) the experience of\ntones, as opposed to mere sounds of various frequencies,\nwhere a tone is heard as being in \u201cmusical space,\u201d that\nis, as bearing relations to other tones such as being higher or lower,\nor of the same kind (at the octave), and (ii) the experience of\nmovement, as when we hear a melody as leaping up or wandering\nfar afield and then coming to rest where it began. Roger Scruton\n(1983; 1997: 1\u201396) argues that these experiences are irreducibly\nmetaphorical, since they involve the application of spatial concepts\nto that which is not literally spatial. (There is no identifiable\nindividual that moves from place to place in a melody (S. Davies 1994:\n229\u201334).) Malcolm Budd (1985b) argues that to appeal to metaphor\nin this context is unilluminating since, first, it is unclear what it\nmeans for an experience to be metaphorical and, second, a\nmetaphor is only given meaning through its interpretation, which\nScruton not only fails to give, but argues is unavailable. Budd\nsuggests that the metaphor is reducible, and thus eliminable,\napparently in terms of purely musical (i.e., non-spatial) concepts or\nvocabulary. Stephen Davies (1994: 234\u201340) doubts that the\nspatial vocabulary can be eliminated, but he is sympathetic to\nBudd\u2019s rejection of the centrality of metaphor. Instead, he\nargues that our use of spatial and motion terms to describe music is a\nsecondary, but literal, use of those terms that is widely used to\ndescribe temporal processes, such as the ups and downs of the stock\nmarket, the theoretical position one occupies, one\u2019s spirits\nplunging, and so on. The debate continues in Budd 2003, Scruton 2004,\nand S. Davies 2011d.\n\nDavies is surely right about the ubiquity of the application of the\nlanguage of space and motion to processes that lack individuals\nlocated in space. The appeal to secondary literal meanings, however,\ncan seem as unsatisfying as the appeal to irreducible metaphor. We do\nnot hear music simply as a temporal process, it might be objected, but\nas moving in the primary sense of the word, though\nwe know that it does not literally so move. Andrew Kania (2015)\ndevelops a position out of this intuition by emphasizing\nScruton\u2019s appeal to imagination while dropping the appeal to\nmetaphor, arguing that hearing the music as moving is a matter of\nimagining that its constituent sounds move. (See also de Clercq 2007\nand Trivedi 2011: 116\u201318.) Kania explicitly models his theory on\nthe popular Waltonian theory of fiction (K. Walton 1990), though\nWalton seems to resist the application of his theory to basic musical\nunderstanding because of the differences between music and more\nparadigmatically representational arts (K. Walton 1988: 358\u20139,\n1994: 53\u20134).\n\nApart from pitch space and melodic movement, there has been little\nphilosophical discussion of either the nature and understanding of\nbasic musical features such as melody, rhythm, meter, and harmony or\nhow these elements work together in complex musical wholes. But see\nRoger Scruton 1997: 19\u201379, 2007; Stephen Davies 2001:\n47\u201371; Hamilton 2007: 119\u201352; and Cheyne, Hamilton, and\nPaddison 2020.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that explicit music-theoretical knowledge\ncan aid deeper musical understanding and is essential for the adequate\ndescription and understanding of musical experiences\u2014including\none\u2019s own (Kivy 1990). However, several philosophers have argued\nthat one need not possess these concepts explicitly (nor the\ncorrelative vocabulary) in order to listen with understanding (Budd\n1985b; 245\u20138; S. Davies 1994: 346\u20139; Levinson 1990d:\n35\u201341). Mark DeBellis (1995: 117\u201331) argues that\nunderstanding fairly basic features of music, such as different kinds\nof cadences, requires a fused experience in which one applies a\nconcept such as dominant seventh in one\u2019s perception of\nthe musical sounds. Stephen Davies (2011c: 88\u201394) responds that\nthe serious but untutored listener should be able to develop\nsuch concepts, and thus have such experiences. Erkki Huovinen (2008)\nprovides an example intended to cast doubt on this. Suppose that a\nmelody is transposed from C major to D-flat major, but in a lower\noctave. One listener might hear the melody as reappearing\nhigher, since D-flat is a half-step above C, while another\nmight hear it as lower, since the constituent pitches of the\nsecond appearance are all lower than those of the first. Only a\nlistener who understands the sense in which both these claims\nare true\u2014that the melody has been transposed down a major\nseventh\u2014truly understands what is going on musically. Yet such\nconcepts of pitch organization \u2026 are not usually learned\nwithout some tuition (Huovinen 2008: 325).\n",
