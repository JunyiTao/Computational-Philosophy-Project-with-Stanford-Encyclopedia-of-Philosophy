Rather,\nour concern should be with a distinctive class of intuitions.\nFor example, research in philosophy has traditionally been conducted\nby trained philosophers who spent years thinking about difficult\nproblems. There is good reason to suspect that the intuitions\ngenerated by this type of process will have a special sort of\nepistemic status, and perhaps these sorts of intuitions can play a\nlegitimate role in philosophy. By contrast, the intuitions explored\nwithin experimental philosophy research tend to be those of ordinary\nfolks, with no prior background in philosophy, and one might think\nthat intuitions of this latter type have no real philosophical\nsignificance.\n\nOne way of spelling out this concern is in terms of what has come to\nbe known as the expertise objection. The key contention here\nis that trained philosophers have a distinctive type of expertise.\nThus, if we want to understand the process at the core of traditional\nphilosophical practice, we need to study people who have this type of\nexpertise. It is no good just looking at the judgments of people who\nhave never taken a single philosophy course. A number of philosophers\nhave developed objections along more or less these lines though with\nimportant differences (Williamson 2007; Ludwig 2007).\n\nThis is an important objection, and to address it, experimental\nphilosophers launched a major effort to study the intuitions of\ntrained philosophers. The results show that trained philosophers still\nshow order effects (Schwitzgebel & Cushman 2012), actor/observer\neffects (Tobia et al. 2013), and effects of temperament (Schulz,\nCokely, & Feltz 2011). Thus, existing work provides at least some\nevidence against the claim that trained philosophers have a\ndistinctive expertise that allows them to escape the sorts of biases\nthat plague the judgments of ordinary folks.\n\nOf course, there are numerous ways of defending the objection against\nthis type of response. It could be argued that although philosophers\ndo not have an ability to avoid biases of the type studied within\nexperimental philosophy, their judgments do differ from those of\nordinary folks in some other important respect. Similarly, it could be\nargued that what gives certain intuitions their privileged epistemic\nstate is not the fact that they come from a particular type of person\n(trained philosophers) but rather the fact that they are the product\nof a particular way of approaching the question (sustained reflection)\n(see, e.g., Kauppinen 2007).\n",
