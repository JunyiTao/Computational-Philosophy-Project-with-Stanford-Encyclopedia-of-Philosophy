    "main_text": "The Meaning of and Debates about Equality of Educational Opportunity || Formal Equality of Educational Opportunity\n3.2 Formal Equality of Educational Opportunity\n\nFormal equality of opportunity is the view that formal rules that make\nreference to personal or ascriptive characteristics should not be\nobstacles to achieving certain goals. Such characteristics include\nrace, socio-economic class, gender, religion, and sexuality. It is\nessentially a concept of equality before the law. It is often\nunderstood as an anti-discrimination principle (See the entry on\n equality of opportunity\n for more discussion).\n\nAs applied to educational opportunity, formal equality of opportunity\nrequires the removal of formal obstacles, in the form of laws or\nentrance criteria for educational institutions, which refer to\nascriptive characteristics. For instance, formal equality of\nopportunity is opposed to legally segregated schools whose admissions\npolicy states that students be white, male or belong to a certain\nreligion. This conception is likewise opposed to laws that endorse or\nrequire segregation in schools. The Brown decision is\ncertainly consistent with at least formal equality of opportunity. At\nthe same time, it is worth noting that formal equality of opportunity\nis at odds with the tolerant attitude many societies take toward\nschools and colleges that are segregated by sex and religion. One\npossible way in which these practices might be reconciled with formal\nequality of educational opportunity would be to argue that this\nprinciple applies only to public educational institutions and not\nprivate schools and colleges. Some people accept that formal equality\nof opportunity is a sufficient norm to guide the distribution of\neducational opportunities, but most political and moral philosophers\naccept it as necessary but not sufficient. A principle of\nnon-discrimination leaves open whether and to what extent the state\nneeds to provide the resources that are required for education, or how\nthose resources should be distributed (see Gutmann 1999: 127ff). Since\nresources are necessary for education\u2014whether in the form of\nbooks and materials, teachers, facilities, and so on\u2014formal\nequality of opportunity is compatible with some children failing to\nactually receive an education. Formal equality of opportunity fails to\nprovide effective equality of opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, formal equality of educational opportunity is not\nconcerned with the informal rules, social norms, or private\ndiscrimination that people in a society face that can have a profound\neffect on a child\u2019s opportunities for education. Consider that\nformal equality of opportunity is compatible with school segregation,\nif school attendance zones were determined by residence and residence\nwere segregated by race and social class (as is typically the case in\nthe U.S.). If integration is a moral imperative, formal equality of\nopportunity cannot achieve this goal (Anderson 2010). Many people\nbelieve that insofar as informal discrimination is an unfair obstacle\nto educational opportunity, it is a serious problem that requires\npolicy attention.\n\nEven if formal equality of opportunity could be defended as a just\ndistributional principle outside of the educational context, perhaps\nbecause going beyond it violates certain rights (see Nozick 1997), it\ncannot be defended in the context of schooling. No democratic society\ncan justify failing to educate the children of its poorest students.\n(Additionally, see Friedman & Friedman, 1990, for a libertarian\nargument for universal education based on its third party\neffects.)\n",
