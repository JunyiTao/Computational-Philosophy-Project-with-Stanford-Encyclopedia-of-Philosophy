    "main_text": "Criteria: What Counts? || Consent\n2.1 Consent\n\nBoth social and legal understandings of rape are typically based at\nleast partly on the notion of consent. (Many laws also include a force\nrequirement, about which more below.) To consent to something is to\nreverse a prima facie supposition about what may and may not\nbe done. In most contexts, there is a standing presumption that one\ndoes not have access to and may not make use of another\u2019s body,\nproperty, personal information, or other elements of his or her\npersonal domain. This presumption is reversed, however, when (and for\nas long as) the other consents to such access. Consent thus alters the\nstructure of rights and obligations between two or more parties.\n\nAssuming for the moment that, in sexual encounters, rape exists where\nconsent is lacking, the question then becomes what counts as consent.\nWomen\u2019s sexual consent has in many instances been understood\nquite expansively, as simply the absence of refusal or resistance;\nfeminists have criticized this approach on the grounds that, among its\nother untoward implications, it regards even unconscious women as\nconsenting (MacKinnon 1989b, 340; Archard 1998, 85). Furthermore, it\nhas too often been assumed that a woman\u2019s appearance, attire,\nstatus, location, prior sexual history, or relationship to the man in\nquestion either function as stand-ins for consent (that is, as\n\u201casking for it\u201d) or render her consent irrelevant or\nunnecessary. A vital task on the feminist agenda has been to challenge\nand discredit such ideas\u2014to deny that what a woman wears, where\nshe goes and with whom, or what sexual choices she has made in the\npast have any relevance to whether she should be seen as having\nconsented to sex on a particular occasion.\n\nConsent in general may be understood as either attitudinal or\nperformative (Kazan 1998). Attitudinal accounts see consent as a\nmental state of affirmation or willingness, while performative\naccounts see it as a certain kind of action or utterance (for\ninstance, saying \u201cyes\u201d or nodding). Because the kinds of\nbehaviors mentioned above (such as wearing revealing clothes, going\nsomewhere alone with a man, or engaging in heavy petting) have often\nbeen claimed by perpetrators to constitute evidence that a woman was\nin a mental state of willingness to have intercourse, feminists have\noften rejected attitudinal accounts in favor of performative ones;\nwith a performative account, in contrast, a defendant can be\nchallenged to articulate exactly what the woman said or did that\nconstituted her consent to intercourse. An added advantage of a\nperformative account is that it suggests that sexual consent is not a\nwoman\u2019s implied default state, but rather must be actively and\naffirmatively granted. Again, this is in contrast to traditional\npatriarchal views, which often assumed that unless a woman physically\nresisted\u2014again, even \u201cto the utmost\u201d\u2014a\nman\u2019s attempt to have intercourse, she was consenting (or at\nleast he was justified in proceeding on that assumption).\n\nOne limitation of a purely performative account of consent is that it\ndoes not take into account the context in which the relevant behavior\nor utterance occurs. For instance, if a woman says \u201cyes\u201d\nor even feigns sexual enthusiasm in order to keep a knife-wielding\nattacker from becoming angry and hurting or killing her, it would be\nabsurd to regard her behavior or utterance as consent (or at least as\nmeaningful consent). The question is what other contextual constraints\nand pressures may also undermine the validity of a woman\u2019s\n(apparent) consent. To put the point another way, having granted that\n\u201cno\u201d always means no, we must recognize that, in some\ncases, \u201cyes\u201d also means no. There are many kinds of\nexplicit and implicit threats that render a woman\u2019s consent to\nsex less than meaningful: the man may threaten to sue for custody of\ntheir children, to derail her green card application, to evict her, or\nsimply to sulk and make her life miserable for days should she refuse\nto have sex. Which (if any) such nonviolent coercive pressures should\nbe regarded as rape, either morally or legally, is a matter of some\ncontroversy (Schulhofer 1998; Burgess-Jackson 1996, 91-106).\n\nThe question is especially important from a feminist point of view,\nsince it is to be expected that in a patriarchal society men\nfrequently hold positions of social, legal, and/or institutional power\nover women and are thus positioned to withhold important benefits from\nwomen who refuse them sexual access, in addition to threatening harms\nand penalties. Viewing at least certain kinds of nonviolent coercive\npressures as incompatible with meaningful consent may yield the\nconclusion that some quid pro quo sexual harassment is also\nrape (Falk 1998). Furthermore, some radical feminists\u2019\ndescription of prostitution as \u201ccommercial sexual\nviolence\u201d (Jeffreys 1997) reflects an expansive understanding of\nthe economic and other coercive pressures that often compel\nwomen\u2019s consent to sexual acts in prostitution (even where\nphysical violence does not play a role).\n",
