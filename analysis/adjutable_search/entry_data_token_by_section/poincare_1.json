    "main_text": "The Structure of Science\n2. The Structure of Science\n\nPoincar\u00e9 sets out a hierarchical view of the sciences in\nScience and Hypothesis (1902), although he does not\nexplicitly use this terminology. In his view the special sciences\npresuppose physics, which presupposes geometry, which in turn\npresupposes arithmetic. Poincar\u00e9 treats topics in a serial\norder\u2014first arithmetic, then geometry, then physics, etc. In the\nintroduction, Poincar\u00e9 says that \u201cSuch is the conclusion\nwe will reach, but to get there, we must first review the sequence of\nsciences, from arithmetic and geometry to mechanics and experimental\nphysics\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902, 2017, 2). The hierarchy\ninterpretation has recently come under criticism in an important pair\nof articles (Dunlop 2016 and 2017). We believe that clarifying what is\nmeant by hierarchy will resolve this debate (see Stump 2017 and\nFolina 2019 for further discussion). What is the relationship between\narithmetic, geometry and the rest of the sciences? Michael Friedman\noriginated the claim that Poincar\u00e9 presents the sciences in a\nhierarchy, and in doing so makes clear that what he means by hierarchy\nis that each lower level must first be in place in order to be able to\nproceed to the next level:\n\n\nBut the point perhaps can be made even more clearly if we consider\nNewton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation. For Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia had already shown clearly how we can empirically\ndiscover the law of universal gravitation\u2014on the presupposition,\nthat is, of the Newtonian laws of motion and Euclidean geometry.\nWithout these presuppositions, however, we certainly would not have\nbeen able to discover the law of gravitation. And the same example\nalso shows clearly how each level in the hierarchy of sciences\npresupposes all of the preceding levels: we would have no laws of\nmotion if we did not presuppose spatial geometry, no geometry if we\ndid not presuppose the theory of mathematical magnitude, and of course\nno mathematics at all if we did not presuppose arithmetic (Friedman\n1999, 76).\n\n\nNote that Friedman mentions the theory of mathematical magnitude as\nwell. There is a step between arithmetic and geometry, namely the\ntheory of mathematical magnitude, which is precisely the topic of\nChapter 2 of Science and Hypothesis. The theory of\nmathematical magnitude presupposes the possibility of indefinite\nrepetition, and therefore something like mathematical induction, which\nPoincar\u00e9 presents as central to arithmetic in Chapter 1 of\nScience and Hypothesis.\n\nThere is direct evidence that Poincar\u00e9 thought that mathematics\nmust be in place before we can do any empirical science. For example,\nin the opening of Chapter 12 of Science and Hypothesis, he\nremarks that: \u201cThe purpose of mathematical theories is not to\nreveal the true nature of things. Such a claim would be unreasonable.\nTheir only goal is to coordinate the physical laws that experiment\nreveals to us, but that we could not even state without the help of\nmathematics\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902, 2017, 143). Dunlop, by\ncontrast, seems to have something much stronger in mind with the idea\nof the hierarchy, which is perhaps why she calls the thesis the\ndependency hierarchy interpretation. She seems to take the\ninterpretation to be a thesis of reductionism, that geometry reduces\nto arithmetic, or at least, the intuitive reasoning used in arithmetic\nis all that we need in geometry.\n\n\nCommentators have suggested that the intuition that grounds the use of\ninduction in arithmetic also underlies the conception of a continuum,\nthat the consistency of geometrical axioms must be proved through\narithmetical induction, and that arithmetical induction licenses the\nsupposition that certain operations form a group (Dunlop 2016,\n274).\n\n\nDunlop is absolutely correct in saying that this is not\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s view. Rather, he says that we need arithmetic\nand further things in order to work in geometry. All that we take\nPoincar\u00e9 to be saying is that we still need to add, subtract,\nmultiply, and divide when we are doing geometry, but we will be doing\nmore than what we do in arithmetic. The reason that we need a theory\nof magnitude before we can do geometry is because we measure things.\nThe reason we need geometry in classical mechanics is because we are\ndoing things like tracking the elliptical orbits of the planets. Thus,\nwe also agree with Dunlop when she says that\n\u201cPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views of arithmetic and geometry cannot\nbe reconciled by supposing geometry to be founded on arithmetical\noperations or principles\u201d (Dunlop 2016, 306). We need\narithmetic, plus group theory, plus the conventions in order to have\nmetric geometry. There may be some authors who made reductionist\nclaims, but it is not what we take from Friedman\u2019s original\npresentation. Furthermore, the reductionist interpretation cannot be\nright when we get to the physical sciences, where there is clearly\nmore content in the higher-level sciences\u2014empirical content that\ncould not possibly be reduced to mathematics.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 discusses the sciences in a sequence, starting with\narithmetic. Mathematical induction is essential in arithmetic, because\nonly by using it can we make assertions about all numbers.\nPoincar\u00e9 considers mathematical induction to be a genuine\nsynthetic a priori. He next considers magnitude, which requires\narithmetic, but goes further. Likewise, geometry extends our knowledge\nstill further, but requires the theory of magnitude to make\nmeasurements, and arithmetic to combine numbers. Poincar\u00e9 then\nconsiders classical mechanics, which again extends our knowledge while\nrelying on the mathematics that came before it. Finally, he considers\ntheories of physics, where we have genuine empirical results, but\nbased on the mathematics, hypotheses and conventions that came before.\nThus the sciences are laid out like expanding concentric circles, with\nnew content being added to the base at each level. The lower levels\nare necessary preconditions for higher levels, but they are not\nsufficient.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 makes hypotheses central to his analysis of science,\ndistinguishing four kinds, which are actually given in two lists of\nthree each (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 24 and 166\u2013167; 2017: 1 and\n109\u2013110). Combining the two lists, these are:\n\nVerifiable hypotheses\nIndifferent (or neutral) hypotheses\nNatural hypotheses\nApparent hypotheses\n\n\nBy verifiable hypotheses, Poincar\u00e9 means general statements\nthat have been confirmed by experiment. These are the backbone of\nnatural science and can be seen non-controversially to be compatible\nwith standard accounts of, say, the Hypothetical-Deductive method.\nHowever, it is important for Poincar\u00e9 that this is not all of\nscience, as he is arguing for a view of science that is between\nempiricism and rationalism.\n\nIndifferent hypotheses are ontological in nature and are, for example,\nmechanical models of underlying mechanism. As Poincar\u00e9\nemphasizes, these can frequently be exchanged without sacrificing\nempirical accuracy. Take, for example, the propagation of heat, where\n\u201cthrough the effects of the averages and thanks to the\nmedium\u2019s symmetry, all the differences even out\u201d and we\nneed not inquire how each molecule radiates. Such hypotheses are mere\ntools useful for thought but \u201cunverifiable\u201d and\n\u201cuseless\u201d as such (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 169; 2017:\n111).\n\nNatural hypotheses are necessary conditions for science but are\nexperimentally inaccessible:\n\n\nIt is difficult not to suppose that the influence of very distant\nbodies is altogether negligible, that small motions obey a linear law,\nthat the effect is a continuous function of its cause. I would say the\nsame of the conditions imposed by symmetry. All these hypotheses form,\nso to speak, the foundation common to all the theories of mathematical\nphysics. (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 166; 2017: 109)\n\n\nFinally, apparent hypotheses are definitions or conventions rather\nthan actual claims about the world. They therefore may not be\nconsidered to be hypotheses at all, although they are, however, often\nmistaken for hypotheses. Poincar\u00e9 argues that (metric) geometry\nis the hypothesis most prone to such confusion. Although he presents\narithmetic in Science and Hypothesis without mentioning\nhypotheses explicitly, we can see a role for them in his analysis here\nas well, which we will present in the order that he follows.\n\nCentral to Poincar\u00e9\u2019s analysis of arithmetic is the\nprinciple of recurrence, or mathematical induction, which he\nconsidered to be a synthetic a priori principle that\n\u201cwould then seem so self-evident that we would not be able to\nconceive of the opposite proposition\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 74;\n2017: 42). The principle of mathematical induction is necessary to\nprove general statements about numbers and is thus a necessary tool in\nmathematics. Therefore the principle of mathematical induction is\nsimilar to a natural hypothesis or at least plays a similar role to\nthat of a natural hypothesis, i. e. a mathematical structure, which is\npresupposed and \u201cmore fundamental than any particular systems of\nnatural numbers\u201d (Folina 2020: 293). Of course, there are\nimportant differences between mathematical induction and the principle\nof induction used in the natural sciences. The principle of\nmathematical induction gives certainty, while the inductive\ngeneralizations in the natural sciences give only probability (1902:\n27; 2017: 3). The principle of mathematical induction is based on\n\u201cthe affirmation of the power of a mind that knows itself\ncapable of conceiving the indefinite repetition of a particular action\nas soon as this action is possible\u201d (1902: 41\u201342; 2017:\n15), so that there can be no uncertainty. It can be argued that\nPoincar\u00e9 is justified in including his analysis of arithmetic\nin Science and Hypothesis, that is, in his analysis of\nempirical science, given that there is a striking similarity between\nthe role played by the principle of mathematical induction and the\nprinciple of induction in natural science, which \u201cis as\ndifficult to justify [\u2026] as it is to get along without\nit\u201d (1905b: 176; 1913b: 345).\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues that (metric) geometry is neither a\npriori nor empirical, but rather conventional. It is important to\nnote, however, that these conventions are guided by experience\naccording to Poincar\u00e9, rather than being totally arbitrary, as\nsome later writers take conventions to be. This connotation of the\nword \u2018convention\u2019 has led to many misrepresentations of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s views. The existence of consistent alternative\ngeometries shows that the geometry of space cannot be determined a\npriori. The fact that we experience material bodies and their\nrelations, rather than space, leads Poincar\u00e9 to argue that the\ngeometry of space cannot be determined empirically either. Thus,\nstatements about the geometry of space are apparent hypotheses or\nconventions that appear to be making descriptive claims, however they\nare actually closer to definitions, though they cannot be reduced to\nbeing merely linguistic.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 conceives of our perception of objects as a\ncombination of motor and visual impressions that are at first\nnon-spatial. In order to classify these sensations, which only appear\nbecause of the movement of our bodies, Poincar\u00e9 says we\nintroduce \u201csensible space\u201d as a category \u201cof our\nunderstanding\u201d that is not physical space and does not even have\na metric, meaning that \u201cit involves no idea of\nmeasurement\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1898). Sensible space is a\nnecessary condition for our understanding of our place in the world,\nthat is, for our understanding of the objects around us, their\nrelations and how they move, but it is not a form of our sensibility,\nsince individual sensations can exist without it (Poincar\u00e9\n1898: 3). Thus sensible space can be seen as an example of a natural\nhypothesis. We introduce a metric to this space in order to measure\ndistance by using the language of group theory, that is, the\nmathematical study of abstract algebraic structures. Groups serve as a\ntool of reasoning about representations of muscular sensations. We can\nchoose a group (or sub-group) which corresponds to the geometry of\nEuclid, Lobachevskii or Riemann to describe space. Poincar\u00e9\nproposes a criterion of choice between the three possible geometries,\npositing\n\n\nthe existence of an invariant sub-group, of which all the\ndisplacements are interchangeable and which is formed of all\ntranslations. (1898: 21)\n\n\nOnly Euclidean geometry meets this criterion, so the conventional\nchoice of Euclidean geometry is determined by the simplicity of\ninterchangeability that \u201ctranslated into analytical language\n[\u2026] means that there are fewer terms in the equations\u201d\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 43). The empirical underdetermination of the\ngroups has a purely contrastive (arbitrary) character if the groups\nare isolated from the background beliefs furnished by our mind\n(Stanford 2009). \u201cHolistic\u201d considerations (commodity,\nsimplicity) overcome the empirical equivalence between different\ngeometries and give more evidence for Euclidean geometry. In contrast\nto geometry, no choices between alternatives are given in\narithmetic.\n\nWe have thus far discussed arithmetic and geometry and examined a\npriori principles, natural hypotheses, and apparent hypotheses.\nIn discussion of natural science Poincar\u00e9 presents his views on\nverifiable hypotheses, which are characterized by mechanical laws that\nare arrived at through experiment:\n\n\nWhat then is a good experiment? It is one that informs us of something\nbesides an isolated fact, one that allows us to make predictions; that\nis, that allows us to generalize. For without generalization, we\ncannot make predictions. (Poincar\u00e9 1902: 158; 2017: 104)\n\n\nThe hypotheses that arise from experiment are verifiable hypotheses.\nThe process of generalization presupposes a belief in the unity and\nsimplicity of nature (see 1902: 161 ff.; 2017: 105 ff.), although it\nis important to remember that for Poincar\u00e9 experience is always\na complex phenomenon that is theory laden. Any good experiment in\nphysics can be generalized in an infinite number of ways, depending on\nour preconceived ideas, and every generalization results in a\nhypothesis. While he emphasizes the creative role of the scientist,\nPoincar\u00e9 does not go so far as to say that natural laws are\nsimple definitions, as Le Roy proposed (1901: 143).\n\nNot all laws are directly accessible to experiment. Generalization in\nphysical science has to take the mathematical form of a differential\nequation in order to grasp complexity and to unify science:\n\n\nIt is not sufficient for each elementary phenomenon to obey simple\nlaws, all those to be combined must obey the same law as well.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1902: 171; 2017: 113).\n\n\nThe law of inertia, for example, obtains only with respect to the\npre-existing category of differential equations. These differential\nequations are, in the final analysis, the physical laws:\n\n\nNewton has shown that a law is only a necessary relation between the\npresent state of the world and its immediately subsequent state. All\nthe laws discovered since are nothing else; they are in sum,\ndifferential equations. (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 119; 1913b: 292)\n\n\nIn geometry, Poincar\u00e9 supposes the pre-existent category of a\ngroup. In mechanics, the categorical tools are the principle of\n(empirical) induction and differential equations. So,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s position represents a hierarchy of elements\nthat, as in Kant, are presupposed as necessary conditions of the\npossibility of the science on the next level. The scheme of\ngeneralization in mechanics appears as follows: Experience provides\ncomplex phenomena, i.e., \u201ca confused mass of facts\u201d which\nwe reduce into a number of elementary phenomena by means of\nexperiment. From these elementary phenomena, we generalize (e.g., via\nthe empirical induction principle) to elementary facts and move, by\nmeans of differential equations, to laws and verifiable hypotheses\nwhose number should be kept as small as possible (Poincar\u00e9\n1902: 168\u2013171; 2017: 110\u2013113). Finally, laws can be\nelevated by decree to the status of principles, thus allowing the\nbasic principles of mechanics to become conventions; not arbitrary\nconventions however, since \u201cThey would be arbitrary [only] if we\nwere to lose sight of the experiments that led the founders of\nmechanics to adopt the laws and which, as imperfect as these\nexperiments may be, suffice to justify them\u201d (1902: 128; 2017:\n82). For Poincar\u00e9 the principles of mechanics\n(principle of inertia, law of acceleration, principle of relative\nmotion, etc.) are not hypotheses but rather conventions\n(Poincar\u00e9 1902: 151; 2017: 99), although they are of course of\nexperimental origin. These conventions do not constitute a choice\nbetween physical alternatives, but rather must be interpreted as\ndefining the basic terms of a theory. Immune to experimental\ndisconfirmation without being a priori in the classical\nsense, they are necessary preconditions to the sciences further up in\nthe hierarchy (Poincar\u00e9 1902: chap. VI and VII).\n\nIn the physical sciences proper, such as optics and electrodynamics,\nthe scene changes entirely and principles seem no longer to share the\nconventional character of the geometrical postulates.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s \u201cindifferent hypotheses\u201d are those\nthat the analyst assumes at the beginning of calculations and that are\nneither true nor false, but rather play roles as occupants in a\nstructure. Indifferent hypotheses differ from geometrical conventions\nin one very important sense. While geometry rests on a conventional\ndecree, the structures of physics (mechanics included) do not\nsystematically rest on indifferent hypotheses; rather, these\nhypotheses have only a psychological and pedagogic function as mental\nconstructs that are in a sense superfluous, since they can change\nwhile leaving the experimental results intact. The basis of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s structural realism can be seen in his idea\nthat the content is superfluous and that it is the relations expressed\nin natural laws that remain through time that are essential to\nscience.\n\nHere then is the methodological analogy and link between the principle\nof induction, conventions in the sense of apparent hypotheses and\nverifiable hypotheses. All are guided by experience without being\n(entirely) experimental, and all involve presupposed categories,\nnatural hypotheses or a given structure (Folina 2020). Verifiable\nhypotheses employ conventional elements in the generalization process\nand may presuppose the (empirical) principle of induction. Geometrical\nconventions are apparent hypotheses guided by the experience of\nmuscular sensations and involve the category of groups. Both these\nsorts of hypotheses, verifiable and apparent, employed in physics and\ngeometry, are in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s hierarchy of sciences framed\non the one hand by a priori principles and natural hypotheses\nthat are tools both for mathematicians and experimenters, and on the\nother hand, by indifferent hypotheses and physical principles. The\nindifferent hypotheses are conventional (in the ordinary sense)\nstipulations of ontological entities\u2014mechanical models that\nincrease our theoretical insight, while the physical principles are\neither verifiable hypotheses elevated by decree beyond the crucible of\nexperiment or well-founded with respect to the network of actual\nscience.\n",
