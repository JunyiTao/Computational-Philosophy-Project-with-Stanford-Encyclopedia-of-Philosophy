    "main_text": "Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology || The Theological Vocation of Metaphysics: The First Principle as Absolute Cause\n2.3 The Theological Vocation of Metaphysics: The First Principle as Absolute Cause\n\nAccording to Avicenna, metaphysics\u2014and no other\nscience\u2014can (and must) establish the existence of a First\nabsolute Principle. Physics, which deals with bodies and their\nmovement, can explain no more than motion (its result is, in fact, a\nPrime Mover) and, unable to answer the fundamental ontological\nquestion about the origin of the world\u2019s being, it\nsimply anticipates the idea of the Principle that metaphysics\ndemonstrates (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 6, 17\u20137, 6;\nI,2,14\u2013end).\n\nFrom this perspective, Avicenna is not Aristotelian: metaphysics must\nexplain the transition from non-being to being, an atemporal\ntransition which does not exclude eternity from what is caused to be.\nHis idea is entirely consistent with Greco-Arabic Neo-Platonism: both\nthe pseudo-Theology of Aristotle (a re-elaboration of\nEnneads IV-VI) and the Book of the pure Good (a\nreworking of Proclus\u2019 Elements of Theology) insist on\nan originated being. At the same time, Avicenna includes in his system\nthe Aristotelian conception of a world eternally in movement: hence\nthe notions of matter, form, potency and act are elaborated so as to\nanswer the question of the origin of the world\u2019s eternal\nexistence. In keeping with Proclus (and against John\nPhiloponus\u2019s position: Davidison 1987; Chase 2012; McGinnis\n2012, 2013), Avicenna considers the world to be\n\u201cinstaured\u201d or absolutely created (mubda\u02bf)\nand at the same time establishes that it is eternal and eternally in\nmotion, as Aristotle\u2019s physics and metaphysics teach. He\ntherefore posits a Principle of the world\u2019s existence\n(wu\u01e7\u016bd) that does not correspond to the prime\nunmoved mover (cf. Commentaire Lambda: 7\u201312;\nTa\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, 62, 14\u201319; Janssens 2003).\nIndeed, according to Avicenna, in metaphysics the efficient cause is a\ncause of existence (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 1, 257,\n13\u201316). It is only in this sense that metaphysicians conceive\nthe Principle as an agent. At the same time, since It is first and\nperfect (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 343, 12\u201315;\nVIII, 7, 368, 2\u20133; 369, 4\u20135; in some passages Avicenna\neven accepts the Neo-Platonic idea of the Principle above perfection:\nfawqa al-tam\u0101m: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IV, 3,\n186, 15; 188, 5\u201315; VIII, 6, 355, 9\u201310), the Principle\nmust also be a final cause (Wisnovsky 2003a: 180\u2013195). The idea\nof aim must then be (aporetically) shifted from the level of movement\nto that of being: the final cause is not a cause of movement but the\nsame efficient cause that makes things exist\n(m\u016b\u01e7id). The First Principle is therefore a cause\nin every respect (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 4, 14\u201317;\nVIII, 3). The prime unmoved mover\u2014which is, in fact, the first\ncaused Intelligence\u2014justifies the movement of the world, but\nrefers in its turn to the Principle, which is absolutely First\n(McGinnis 2010a: 151; cf. Physics of \u201cThe\nHealing\u201d IV, 15).\n",
