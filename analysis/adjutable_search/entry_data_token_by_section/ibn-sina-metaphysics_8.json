    "main_text": "Essence and Existence || Quiddity and Mental Existence\n3.4 Quiddity and Mental Existence\n\nNevertheless, composition is not the result of an addition. The\nquiddity or essence of a thing is not in its turn a\n\u201cthing\u201d with its own mental existence so that, once added\nto (real) existence, it could become a real thing (Lizzini 2014). This\nwould not only lead to infinite division (in the quiddity one would\nagain distinguish quiddity from existence), but also\u2014as Avicenna\nnotes\u2014to Platonism (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 204,\n4\u20135; cf. VII, 2\u20133; Marmura 2006; Porro 2002, 2011a). But\nhere lies the problem: the distinction between essence and existence\ncannot obviously lead to the conclusion that essence is simply\nnon-existent (no affirmative statement about the absolutely\nnon-existent is possible: Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32,\n12\u201313; cf. 15\u201316). What Avicenna states by distinguishing\nquiddity and existence in what exists either in the mind or in reality\nis that quiddity does not coincide with the existence of the thing:\nneither with its mental existence, which is related but does not\ncorrespond to universality, nor with its concrete existence\n(f\u012b l-\u02bfay\u0101n), which implies individuality. On\nthis point there are two fundamental if problematic sections of\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t (V 1\u20132) where Avicenna outlines the\nso-called theory of the \u201cindifference of essence\u201d: in\nitself quiddity is only quiddity (equinity is only equinity:\nfa-l-farasiyya f\u012b nafsi-h\u0101 farasiyya faqa\u1e6d\nor, according to the celebrated Latin formula, equinitas ergo in\nse est equinitas tantum). The same logical consideration\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r) that Avicenna applies to the existence of\nGod and existence in general serves here to explain the separation of\nquiddity from existence: the animal that is not on condition\nof something other is the animal in its reality or quiddity; it\ncan exist either in the mind or in the concrete world but\nonly if it is accompanied by some fulfilled conditions; the animal\non condition of not (i.e., of not being accompanied by any\nother), is the abstract form that results from a mental consideration\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 203, 15\u2013204, 13). Indeed,\nwhen it is considered either in intellectu or in re,\nquiddity is accompanied by existence and by the quantitative\ndetermination that belongs to it: it is then either universal or\nparticular, although in itself it is neither universal nor\nparticular and is nothing but quiddity. When it is considered with a\nquantitative determination, quiddity is thus no longer considered as\nit is in itself (Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019\nQuaestiones I.3 and I.11 have been indicated as the source of\nthis distinction: Menn 2013; cf. de Libera 1999; Benevich 2019). Every\nintention (ma\u02bfn\u0101), that of universality\u2014which\nis the inherent non-impossibility of a multiple predication\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 195, 4\u2013196, 3)\u2014and\nthose of particularity or unity, accompanies quiddity in existence\n(mental or real); in Avicenna\u2019s technical terminology they are\nattributes (\u1e63if\u0101t) or necessary concomitants\n(law\u0101zim) of the quiddity of the thing, not identical\nwith it. Quiddity (e.g., equinity) is not the universal (of horse):\n\n\n\nthe universal (al-kull\u012b) insofar as it is universal, is\none thing, but insofar as it is something accompanied by universality,\nit is another thing. (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 196, 6;\nMarmura 1992, slightly modified; see also The Metaphysics of the\nHealing, 149)\n\n\nThe indifference of quiddity to any kind of determination truly\nestablishes the correspondence between reality and knowledge: it is\nexactly because quiddity is in itself neither real (i.e. extra-mental)\nnor mental that it can be present both in reality and in the mind,\naccompanied by the determinations of either individuality or\nuniversality: in concrete reality there is x in its particular\nexistence, while in the mind there is x with its possible multiple\npredication. In this respect, the consideration of quiddity\nin itself\u2014which corresponds to the thing in itself as expressed\nby its definition\u2014transcends both levels of existence (external\nand mental) and in one passage is equated to the \u201cdivine\nexistence\u201d (wu\u01e7\u016bd il\u0101h\u012b) of\nsomething that depends on God\u2019s providence\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, V, 1, 204, 16\u2013205, 4; for the\npossible reference to Ya\u1e25y\u0101 ibn \u02bfAd\u012b\u2019s\ndiscussion of Alexander\u2019s essentialism, see Rashed 2004; Menn\n2013; Benevich 2018, 2019; cf. Black 1999). Quiddity is in fact the\n\u2018reality\u2019 of the thing and is always identical to itself\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 31,2\u20139, 36,4\u20136).\nRecently scholars have analyzed the question of the reality and the\nbeing of quiddity from both a logical (Benevich 2018) and an\nontological perspective, highlighting the point that the discussion of\nthe universals plays a crucial role in understanding Avicenna\u2019s\ntheory of quiddity in itself (Janos 2020; cf. de Libera 1999; Marmura\n1992). The crux of the matter lies in the notion of mental existence.\nClearly through consideration one ascribes properties to\nquiddity and in that respect quiddity is existent or realised (see\ne.g. Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 32,12). Consideration\n(i\u02bftib\u0101r) should therefore be conceived as grantinga\nkind of existence, although not as a composition of essence\nandexistence (for the mereological interpretations of quiddity, see\nDeHaan 2014 ; Benevich 2018 ; Janos 2020). \n",
