    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nThe external facts of Philo\u2019s career are largely undisputed. He\nwas born in 159/8 BCE (but see Fleischer 2017b). After eight years of\nstudy with Callicles, a student of Carneades, in his native Larissa,\nPhilo moved to Athens in 134/3 BCE, where he spent fourteen years with\nClitomachus, another of Carneades\u2019 students, who was the\nscholarch (or head) of the Academy from 129/8 (or perhaps 127/6) to\nhis death in 110/9 BCE. Philo was elected to replace Clitomachus in\nthat year, and remained the scholarch until his death in 84/3 BCE.\n\nPhilo\u2019s tenure as head of the Academy was troubled by two\nevents. First, in the late 90s BCE his authority was challenged by the\nsecession of his student Antiochus of Ascalon, who set up a rival\nanti-skeptic \u201cOld Academy\u201d. (A second student,\nAenesidemus, also left the Academy to found or revive the radically\nskeptical Pyrrhonist school, probably in the 90s BCE; but the dating\nof this secession to Philo\u2019s tenure as scholarch is insecure.)\nSecondly, civil unrest in Athens and the threat of the Mithridatic war\nled to an exodus of Academic philosophers to safer cities. Philo\nhimself moved to Rome in 89/8 BCE, where he continued to give lectures\nand published his \u201cRoman Books\u201d. It is unclear whether he\never returned to Athens after its \u201cpacification\u201d by the\nRomans in 86 BCE. The name of his successor as scholarch, who probably\noversaw the final demise of the Academy as an institution, is also\nunclear. (The section of Philodemus\u2019 Catalogue of Academic\nPhilosophers\u2014our main source for his\nbiography\u2014dealing with Philo\u2019s death, his students, and\nhis successor, is at several points illegible; see Fleischer 2017c.)\nNone of Philo\u2019s written works survive, but we possess a summary\nof a work on ethics, some direct evidence for his Roman Books and\nearlier epistemological views, and indirect evidence for a work on\nrhetoric.\n",
