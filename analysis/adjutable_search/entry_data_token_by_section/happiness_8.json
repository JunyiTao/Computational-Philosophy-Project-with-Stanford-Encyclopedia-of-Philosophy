    "main_text": "The science of happiness || Empirical findings: overview\n3.2 Empirical findings: overview\n\nThe scientific literature on happiness has grown to proportions far\ntoo large for this article to do more than briefly touch on a few\n highlights.[16]\n Here is a sampling of oft-cited claims:\n\nMost people are happy\nPeople adapt to most changes, tending to return over time to their\nhappiness \u201cset point\u201d\nPeople are prone to make serious mistakes in assessing and\npursuing happiness\nMaterial prosperity has a surprisingly modest impact on\nhappiness\n\n\nThe first claim, that most people are happy, appears to be a consensus\nposition among subjective well-being researchers (for a seminal\nargument, see Diener and Diener 1996). The contention reflects three\nlines of evidence: most people, in most places, report being happy;\nmost people report being satisfied with their lives; and most people\nexperience more positive affect than negative. On any of the major\ntheories of happiness, then, the evidence seems to show that most\npeople are, indeed, happy. Yet this conclusion might be resisted, on a\ncouple of grounds. First, life satisfaction theorists might question\nwhether self-reports of life satisfaction suffice to establish that\npeople are in fact satisfied with their lives. Perhaps self-reports\ncan be mistaken, say if the individual believes herself satisfied yet\nshows many signs of dissatisfaction in her behavior, for instance\ncomplaining about or striving to change important things in her life.\nSecond, defenders of affect-based theories\u2014hedonistic and\nemotional state views\u2014might reject the notion that a bare\nmajority of positive affect suffices for happiness. While the\ntraditional view among hedonists has indeed been that happiness\nrequires no more than a >1:1 ratio of positive to negative affect,\nthis contention has received little defense and has been disputed in\nthe recent literature. Some investigators have claimed\nthat \u201cflourishing\u201d requires greater than a 3:1 ratio of\npositive to negative affect, as this ratio might represent a threshold\nfor broadly favorable psychological functioning (e.g., Larsen and\nPrizmic 2008). While the evidence for any specific ratio is highly\ncontroversial, if anything like this proportion were adopted as the\nthreshold for happiness, on a hedonistic or emotional state theory,\nthen some of the evidence taken to show that people are happy could in\nfact show the opposite. In any event, the empirical claim relies\nheavily on nontrivial philosophical views about the nature of\nhappiness, illustrating one way in which philosophical work on\nhappiness can inform scientific research.\n\nThe second claim, regarding adaptation and set points, reflects\nwell-known findings that many major life events, like being disabled\nin an accident or winning the lottery, appear strongly to impact\nhappiness only for a relatively brief period, after which individuals\nmay return to a level of happiness not very different from\n before.[17]\n As well, twin studies have found that subjective well-being is\nsubstantially heritable, with .50 being a commonly accepted figure.\nConsequently many researchers have posited that each individual has a\ncharacteristic \u201cset point\u201d level of happiness, toward\nwhich he tends to gravitate over time. Such claims have caused some\nconsternation over whether the pursuit and promotion of happiness are\nlargely futile enterprises (Lykken and Tellegen 1996; Millgram 2000).\nHowever, the dominant view now seems to be that the early claims about\nextreme adaptation and set points were exaggerated: while adaptation\nis a very real phenomenon, many factors\u2014including\ndisability\u2014can have substantial, and lasting, effects on how\nhappy people\n are.[18]\n This point was already apparent from the literature on correlates and\ncauses of happiness, discussed below: if things like relationships and\nengaging work are important for happiness, then happiness is probably\nnot simply a matter of personality or temperament. As well, the large\ncross-national differences in measured happiness are unlikely to be\nentirely an artifact of personality variables. Note that even highly\nheritable traits can be strongly susceptible to improvement. Better\nliving conditions have raised the stature of men in the Netherlands by\neight inches\u2014going from short (five foot four) to tall (over six\nfeet)\u2014in the last 150 years (Fogel 2005). Yet height is\nconsidered much more heritable than happiness, with typical\nheritability estimates ranging from .60 to over .90 (e.g.,\nSilventoinen, Sammalisto et al.\n 2003).[19]\n",
