    "main_text": "Political Philosophy in the Roman Empire || Platonisms and Other Philosophies in the Empire\n8. Conclusion\n\nOn a continuum of political rule stretching from the sheer domination\nof some over others on one extreme, to a vision of collaborative\ndeliberation among equals for the sake of the good life on the other,\nmany ancient Greek and Roman political philosophers clearly staked out\nthe latter ground. The very idea of the city and the civic bond as\nrooted in justice was common ground across much of the spectrum of\nancient political philosophy. Even the Epicureans saw society as\nrooted in justice, although understanding justice in turn as rooted in\n utility.[17]\n Philosophers adhering to this approach were not however ignorant of\npossible objections to it. The diagnosis of politics as domination has\nnever been more powerfully advanced than by Plato\u2019s character\nThrasymachus, nor has the attack on justice as a good life for the\nindividual ever been as powerfully made as by Plato\u2019s character\nCallicles or the skeptic Carneades. The nostalgic view of ancient\npolitical philosophy as predicated on widely shared conceptions of\nhuman nature and the human good, before the splintering and fracturing\nof modernity, is an oversimplification.\n\nIt is true that those ancient visions of politics which rooted\nthemselves in a commitment to ethical cultivation and the common good\ndid not have to contend with the absolutist claims of rival versions\nof monotheistic religions. But the ancients did have to answer various\nforms of relativism, immoralism, and skepticism, contending with rival\nphilosophical schools which disagreed profoundly with one another. If\nsome of them chose to see politics as a domain of common benefit and a\nspace for the cultivation of virtue, this was not because it had not\noccurred to them that it could be thought of otherwise, but in part\nbecause they had developed powerful philosophical systems to support\nthis view. The experience and practices of the Greek poleis\n(the plural of polis) and the Roman res publica\nplayed important roles in shaping these approaches.\n\nPlato and Aristotle can in many ways be seen as defending some\nfundamental tenets of Greek ethics (such as the value of justice), but\ndoing so by means of advancing revisionist philosophical doctrines and\ndistancing themselves from the ways in which those tenets were\ninterpreted by the democratic institutions of their day. The range of\nethical and political views which they, along with their Hellenistic\nsuccessors, laid out, continue to define many of the fundamental\nchoices for modern philosophy, despite the many important innovations\nin institutional form and intellectual approach which have been made\nsince. Many of those innovations, indeed, came in response to a\nrevival of the ancient skeptical and relativist challenges: challenges\nalready known from their evolution within ancient political philosophy\nitself.\n",
