    "main_text": "The History of the Hole Argument || \u2026and Climbs out Again\n8.2 \u2026and Climbs out Again\n\nEinstein struggled on for two years with his misshapen theory of\nlimited covariance. Late in 1915, as evidence of his errors mounted\ninexorably, Einstein was driven to near despair and ultimately\ncapitulation. He returned to the search for generally covariant\nequations with a new urgency, fueled in part by the knowledge that\nnone other than David Hilbert had thrown himself into analysis of his\ntheory. Einstein\u2019s quest came to a happy close in late November\n1915 with the completion of his theory in generally covariant\nform.\n\nFor a long time it was thought that Hilbert had beaten Einstein by\nfive days to the final theory. New evidence in the form of the proof\npages of Hilbert\u2019s paper now suggests he may not have. More\nimportantly, it shows clearly that Hilbert, like Einstein, at least\ntemporarily believed that the hole argument precluded all generally\ncovariant theories and that the belief survived at least as far as the\nproof pages of his paper. (See Corry, Renn and Stachel 1997.)\n\nWhile Einstein had tacitly withdrawn his objections to generally\ncovariant theories, he had not made public where he thought the hole\nargument failed. This he finally did when he published what John\nStachel calls the \u201cpoint-coincidence argument.\u201d This\nargument, well known from Einstein\u2019s (1916, p.117) review of his\ngeneral theory of relativity, amounts to a defence of Leibniz\nEquivalence. He urges that the physical content of a theory is\nexhausted by the catalog of the spacetime coincidences it licenses.\nFor example, in a theory that treats particles only, the coincidences\nare the points of intersection of the particle worldlines. These\ncoincidences are preserved by transformations of the fields. Therefore\ntwo systems of fields that can be intertransformed have the same\nphysical content; they represent the same physical system.\n\nOver the years, the hole argument was deemed to be a trivial error by\nan otherwise insightful Einstein. It was John Stachel (1980) who\nrecognized its highly non-trivial character and brought this\nrealization to the modern community of historians and philosophers of\nphysics. (See also Stachel, 1986.) In Earman and Norton (1987), the\nargument was recast as one that explicitly targets spacetime\nsubstantivalism. For further historical discussion, see Howard and\nNorton (1993), Janssen (1999), Klein (1995) and Norton (1987). A\nthorough, synoptic treatment in four volumes is Renn (2007); for a\nhistory of the philosophical revival of the hole argument, see\nWeatherall (2020).\n\nFor an account of the appropriation and misappropriation of\nEinstein\u2019s point-coincidence argument by the logical\nempiricists, see Giovanelli (2013).\n",
