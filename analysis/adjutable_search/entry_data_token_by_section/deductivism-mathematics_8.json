    "main_text": "Meaning Matters\n4. Meaning Matters\n\nWe outlined some of the historical support for deductivism in\n \u00a73.\n In\n \u00a7\u00a75\u20139,\n we consider some of the challenges it faces. In the present section,\nwe aim to achieve greater clarity on what semantic claim the\ndeductivist makes.\n\nThe first point is that we have characterised deductivism as\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d or \u201cconstruing\u201d or\n\u201crendering\u201d a mathematical sentence \\(p\\) as \u201c\\(Ax\n\\vdash p\\)\u201d This characterisation is deliberately neutral\nbetween two more precise readings. One is that deductivists take their\nconstrual to capture the meanings of mathematical statements as\nordinarily\n spoken.[10]\n The other is that they aim to do no such thing but wish instead to\nprovide a reconstruction of mathematics answering to philosophical\ncriteria. One such criterion might be proximity to\nmathematical discourse as ordinarily understood\u2014but typically\nthis will not be an overriding factor. Other criteria will include\ngiving an attractive metaphysics, epistemology and account of the\napplications of mathematics. This entry will stay neutral on this\npoint, though it should be noted that the first approach faces a\nconsiderable burden of proof: there are no obvious grounds to think\nthat we actually speak in deductivist fashion.\n\nThe second point is that the deductivist has to offer more than the\nsimple claim that a mathematical sentence \\(p\\) should be construed as\n\u201c\\(Ax \\vdash p\\)\u201d. For one thing, her (meaning-capturing\nor reconstructive) semantics for mathematics cannot be confined to the\nsentence level but must also apply to words. The deductivist must, for\ninstance, give a semantic account of the numeral \u201c2\u201d and\nthe predicate \u201cis prime\u201d compatible with her construal of\n\u201c2 is prime\u201d as \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash 2\\) is\nprime\u201d.\n\nFor another, she must give an account of speech acts involving\nmathematical statements. It is natural to suppose that she construes\nan assertion of \u201c569 is prime\u201d, say, as an assertion of\n\u201c\\(Ax \\vdash 569\\) is prime\u201d. Likewise, presumably, for\nmany propositional attitudes: for the deductivist, what we might\nordinarily describe as wondering whether 569 is prime should be\nunderstood as wondering whether the axioms deductively imply that 569\nis prime; what we might ordinarily describe as doubting that 569 is\nprime should be understood as doubting that the axioms deductively\nimply that 569 is prime; and so on. A tentative suggestion might then\nbe that the deductivist should take \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash\\)\u201d to\nhave narrow scope over force operators (asserting, wondering,\ndoubting, etc.).\n\nNeither of these tasks\u2014providing a word-level semantics for\nmathematical language and an account of speech acts involving\nmathematical sentences\u2014seems entirely straightforward. As for\nthe first, deductivists\u2019 account of mathematical language must\nallow for its use in empirical contexts to make straightforwardly\nliteral claims. For example, \u201cthere were 569 people in the\naudience\u201d should presumably not be understood as a covert\nimplication from axioms but rather as a literal claim about a physical\nsituation. For the deductivist, then, this is quite a different use of\n\u201c569\u201d from a purely mathematical one.\n \u00a78\n discusses the problem of applications for the deductivist (though at\nthe sentence- rather than word-level).\n\nAs for the second, it\u2019s not clear that the deductivist will\nalways wish to apply the \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash\\)\n\u201d-takes-narrow-scope strategy in the same mechanical way. Take\nfor example proof by assumption, in which we first assume \\(p_1\\) and\ndeduce \\(p_n\\) via \\(p_2 , \\ldots , p_{n-1}\\). Our initial supposition\n\\(p_1\\) might be that \\(m\\) is an odd perfect number and the final\nline \\(p_n\\) might be some interesting fact about any such \\(m\\).\nIt\u2019s not at all obvious that \u201cassume\u201d here takes\nwide scope and \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash\\) \u201d takes narrow scope. For if\nit did, \u201cAssume \\(p_1\\)\u201d would be construed as\n\u201cAssume \\(Ax \\vdash p_1\\)\u201d, which intuitively is a\ndifferent claim. A more technical way of seeing this is that because\n\\(m\\) does not occur free in \\(Ax\\), it seems that we can generalise\nto obtain \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash \\forall m p_1\\)\u201d. If so,\n\u201cAssume that \\(Ax\\) proves that \\(m\\) is an odd perfect\nnumber\u201d implies \u201cAssume that \\(Ax\\) proves that for every\n\\(m, m\\) is an odd perfect number\u201d. But that latter assumption\nis an outright false claim. A more promising approach is to take the\nfirst step in a supposition as allowing us to add \\(p_1\\) to the axiom\nset, and to then construe the second line as \u201c\\(Ax + p_1 \\vdash\np_2\\)\u201d (or its equivalent via the Deduction Theorem \u201c\\(Ax\n\\vdash p_1 \\rightarrow p_2\\)\u201d), the third line as \u201c\\(Ax +\np_1 \\vdash p_3\\)\u201d (or \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash p_1 \\rightarrow\np_3\\)\u201d), and so on. All in all, there is work for the\ndeductivist to do on this front to spell out these ideas into a\ncoherent theory.\n\nA third point is based on Parsons\u2019s (2008: 55 n. 35) distinction\nbetween what might be called reflexive and\nunreflexive deductivism. Deductivism as this entry defined it\nis reflexive, because it interprets \\(p\\) as \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash\np\\)\u201d. Unreflexive deductivism, by contrast, interprets \\(p\\) as\n\u201cif \\(\\wedge Ax\\) then \\(p\\)\u201d (\\(\\wedge\\) is an operator\nthat conjoins all the elements of the axiom set) and asserts that this\nconditional is a deductive logical truth. Rheinwald (1984: 50) opts\nfor the former, reflexive form, as we have. Commenting on Rheinwald,\nParsons advocates adopting the latter, unreflexive, form instead. For,\nas he sees it, the reflexive form introduces an inessential element of\nreflection\u2014explicit mention of the axioms\u2014into the content\nof mathematical statements, which he thinks they lack. Parsons has a\npoint, especially if deductivism is intended as meaning-capturing.\nEven so, this entry takes deductivism to be reflexive to avoid the\nproblem faced by unreflexive deductivism when the set of axioms is\ninfinite, as it is for example in the case of the first-order Peano\nAxioms. For in that case, the sentence \u201cif \\(\\wedge Ax\\) then\n\\(p\\)\u201d is infinitely long, so not an ordinary-language one. In\ncontrast, \u201c\\(Ax \\vdash p\\)\u201d is an ordinary sentence of\n(mathematical) English, where \u201c\\(Ax\\)\u201d is a name denoting\nthe relevant axiom set. That said, it may be that unreflexive\ndeductivism is better equipped to handle some of the problems\ndeductivism faces.\n\nA fourth and final point. So far, this entry remained neutral on what\nthe axioms \u201c\\(Ax\\)\u201d in the statement of deductivism are. A\n\u201clocal\u201d deductivist, as illustrated in\n \u00a71,\n deductively conditionalises the theorems of a branch of mathematics\non the branch\u2019s axioms, e.g., theorems of arithmetic on the\naxioms of Peano Arithmetic. Another sort of deductivism might\nconditionalise on the axioms of a particular alleged foundation for\nmathematics, say ZFC set theory. Thus a ZFC-deductivist understands a\nmathematical claim \\(p\\) as \u201c\\(p\\) follows deductively from the\nZFC axioms\u201d. The choice of ZFC is not essential: if the\ndeductivist\u2019s preferred foundation is not ZFC, but some other\nset theory, or a topos theory, or something else altogether, they\ncould base their deductivism on that instead. A third, similar but\nlooser form of deductivism than this might be called\n\u201cwhatever-it-takes deductivism\u201d. On this view, the axioms\nprovability from which constitutes mathematical truth are not a\nspecific collection, such as the ZFC axioms, but are more vaguely\ndescribed: they are whatever axioms it takes to prove the theorems of\nmathematics. This last version has the advantage over the second of\nnot tying provability, perhaps artificially, to a single foundational\nsystem. However, it achieves this at the cost of considerable\n imprecision.[11]\n In short, different forms of deductivism result from different\nunderstandings of \u201c\\(Ax\\)\u201d in deductivism\u2019s\ncanonical statement.\n5. Provability: to reify or not to reify?\n\nThe rest of this entry examines five challenges to deductivism, one\nper section in\n \u00a7\u00a75\u20139.\n The first turns on the notion of provability. Since deductivism\nclaims that mathematics is about what is provable in certain axiom\nsystems, providing an account of provability is central to it. The\nissue is whether to cash out provability in terms of the existence of\nproofs or not. In short, to reify or not to reify?\n\nTake the reifying approach first. It reads \u201c\\(p\\) is provable\nfrom \\(Ax\\)\u201d as \u201cthere is a proof of \\(p\\) from axioms\n\\(Ax\\)\u201d (in a particular deductive system understood). This is\nthe most natural and most standard understanding of provability. On\nthis approach, to say that a system \\(T\\) is consistent is just to say\nthat there is no formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of \\(T\\) such that\nthere is a proof of \\(\\phi\\) from \\(T\\) and a proof of \\(\\neg \\phi\\)\nfrom \\(T\\). However, some formulas and proofs are far too long to have\nconcrete physical instantiations; a simple example would be the proof\nof a numerical equation involving extremely large numbers. Even a\nformula with concrete instantiations should not be identified with a\nparticular one of these, or with the class of its instantiations. In\nother words, proofs as understood here are types rather than tokens:\nabstract strings conforming to the rules set by a deductive system,\nwhich exist irrespectively of any physical instantiations in speech,\nor on whiteboards, paper or screens. Indeed, if the deductivist wishes\nto retain the ability to refer to theories, as she will surely want\nto, she will have to accept linguistic types anyway. (Compare\nField-like nominalists, who must also refer to scientific and\nmathematical theories, even as they try to avoid reference to\nmathematical objects.)\n\nThe moral is that the deductivist will have to admit linguistic types.\nHer motivation for being a deductivist therefore cannot be to avoid\nall abstract objects (i.e., nominalism), since linguistic\ntypes are abstract. She must consequently motivate why admitting some\nabstract objects such as types is acceptable, whereas admitting\nmathematical objects is not. She might point to considerations of\neconomy: linguistic types are but a small part of the abstract realm.\nOr she might argue on the epistemological front that linguistic types\nare more easily knowable, since they have concrete instances, unlike\nmathematical objects, which do not. However, the literature is not\nshort of arguments that those who reject abstract mathematical objects\nshould also reject abstract linguistic types; see for example\nWetzel\u2019s 2009 book Types and Tokens.\n\nOf course, one could be a deductivist for other reasons than an\naversion to abstract objects. As we saw in\n \u00a74,\n one sort of deductivist might hold that a semantic analysis reveals\nthe meaning of mathematical statements to be of the form\n\u201c\\(p\\) deductively follows from the axioms\u201d. It is\nperfectly consistent to combine this view with an acceptance of\nabstract objects and the standard account of deductive consequence in\nterms of the existence of proofs. Yet, although perfectly coherent,\nthe view appears to lack independent motivation.\n\nThe alternative to reifying, evidently, is not to reify, and the most\nobvious way of doing so is to go down a modal route. Instead of\ncashing out provability by means of proof-existence, deductivists\ncould take provability to be a modal primitive. Logical possibility\nand necessity are these days typically understood model-theoretically:\na statement is logically possible or consistent just when it is true\nin some model; and necessary just when it is true in all models. The\ndeductivist must abjure this account of consistency (which she equates\nwith logical possibility), on pain of re-introducing mathematics in\nthe metatheory. Against the prevailing model-theoretic account, she\nmust take \u201cit is logically possible that\u201d as a primitive\nnotion, and forgo its analysis in terms of models (Putnam 1967b). In\nso doing, she is in the same boat as all anti-platonists who cannot\nhelp themselves to model theory or set theory in the metatheory. This\nparticular boat is a crowded one: it holds not just eliminative\nstructuralists, but also formalists of various stripes and nominalists\nas well. Nominalists, for example, do not believe in abstract objects.\nHence they face the same predicament\u2014they cannot appeal to the\nexistence of models in the metatheory. Hartry Field (1991) develops a\nnominalist logic that takes the notion of logical consistency as\nprimitive, which we may symbolise as \\(\\diamond\\), with the associated\nnotion of logical necessity being \\(\\square\\). In particular,\n\\(\\diamond T\\) is the claim that the theory \\(T\\) is logically\nconsistent, and claims of logical implication are conditionals\nprefaced by\n \\(\\square\\).[12]\n The non-reifying deductivist can avail themself of these resources\nand thereby construe \\(G \\vdash p\\) as \\(\\square(\\wedge G \\rightarrow\np)\\).\n\nSuch \u201cmodalist\u201d accounts of logical consequence \u00e0\nla Field have had a fairly low take-up among logicians. Many see\nlittle reason to prefer them to the model-theoretic account of\nconsequence. Modalist accounts suffer from problems of expressive\nadequacy, because they cannot quantify over possibilities; and they\nare theoretically less virtuous than the usual model-theoretic one,\npositing as they do primitive links between the existence of set\nmodels and primitive consistency facts. Chapter 4 of Melia (2003) is a\nlucid overview of the problems faced by modalism about\nmetaphysical modality, which have counterparts in the logical\ncase. If the deductivist takes the non-reifying route, they will have\nto come up with a satisfactory response to these sorts of\nchallenges.\n6. Unaxiomatic Mathematics\n\nA second objection to deductivism is that deductivism cannot account\nfor unaxiomatic\n mathematics.[13]\n This includes pre-axiomatic mathematics such as, say, \u201cOld\nBabylonian\u201d mathematics of the early second millennium BC, in\nwhich first principles are never stated explicitly (Robson 2008:\n 90).[14]\n But it also includes non-deductive mathematics; for example, we might\nwish to credit the eighteenth-century Swiss mathematician Euler with\nknowledge of results obtained through analogical reasoning, extensive\nverification of cases, and the like.\n\nIt seems right to attribute mathematical knowledge to Babylonian\nmathematicians who, among other things, were able to solve specific\nquadratic equations. Still, the challenge may not be that worrying.\nThat first principles were not explicit does not mean that they were\nnot implicit. Presumably, any mathematical principle that Babylonian\nmathematicians were willing to accept without argument should count as\na first principle or axiom. Independently of this point, deductivists\nshould also point out that unaxiomatic methods can yield knowledge if\nthey track what a proof would yield. Babylonian mathematicians used\nmethods that reliably produced solutions to specific quadratic\nequations, even if they could not formulate, still less solve, the\ngeneral quadratic equation. Euler\u2019s methods reliably tracked the\nexistence of proofs for his results; if they had not, he would not\nhave been right as often as he was. This deals with the vast majority\nof such cases. Moreover\u2014thinking about the residual\ncases\u2014there is some reason to think that non-deductive reasoning\ncan yield knowledge of mathematical truth even in the absence of proof\n(Paseau 2015).\n7. A Regress?\n\nWe turn now to the third challenge. To introduce it, consider whether\ndeductivism should apply to a sentence such as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\)\n\n\n(As usual, we write \\(Ax\\) to preserve neutrality on what the axioms\nare exactly; see\n \u00a74\n for the options here.) Since proof theory appears to be a branch of\nmathematics like any other, you might suppose that a consistent\ndeductivist should construe this sentence like any other mathematical\none. In which case, the sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d should be\nconstrued not as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\),\n\n\nbut instead as\n\n\nthe sentence \u201cthe sentence \u2018\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u2019\ndeductively follows from \\(Ax\\)\u201d deductively follows from\n\\(Ax'\\).\n\n\n(Where \\(Ax'\\) may or may not be identical to \\(Ax\\)\u2014this will\nnot affect the main point.) Now if a deductivist is to go down to this\nroute, she will also have to construe this last sentence like any\nother mathematical one. So it should be glossed in the same way. The\nsame applies to the resulting gloss, and so on without end. Clearly,\nwe are off on an infinite regress.\n\nIt seems to follow that for the deductivist there is no finite\nformulation of the sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d. Any such\nformulation would have to be infinite, and, if it ends at all, must\nend in a sentence \\(s\\) that is a \u201cfixed-point\u201d of this\niteration. In other words, \\(s\\) must be identical (not just logically\nequivalent) to \u201cthe sentence \\(s\\) deductively follows from\n\\(Ax\\)\u201d (for some \\(Ax)\\) since \\(s\\) is construed by the\ndeductivist as\n\n\nthe sentence \\(s\\) deductively follows from \\(Ax\\)\n\n\nWhether such a sentence exists is highly dubious. Even if it does, an\ninfinitely long sentence, with infinitely many embeddings, is an\nabsurdly complicated way to interpret \u201c\\(2+ 2 = 4\\)\u201d,\nwhich after all is one of the simplest sentences of mathematics,\nindeed of the English language.\n\nThe objection just raised is premised on the idea that provability\nclaims are mathematical. To support this premise, the\nobjection\u2019s proponent might point out that results in proof\ntheory are typically infused with mathematics. Our conviction that\nsome statement is provable in a deductive system is not usually a\nresult of having carried out the proof ourselves, starting from the\naxioms and applying the rules of inference to derive the theorem.\nRather, it often follows from more abstract mathematical\nreasoning.\n\nHow should the deductivist reply to this challenge? She can agree that\nwe use mathematics, sometimes even quite sophisticated mathematics, to\ndetermine what deductively follows from some axioms. That is an\nepistemological point. But it does not affect her thesis\nabout what mathematics is. For the deductivist, the truth of\na mathematical claim \\(p\\) consists in its being a theorem of an\nappropriate deductive system \\(D\\). How we determine what\n\\(D\\)\u2019s theorems are may require mathematics\u2014this is to\napply mathematics to proof systems\u2014and perhaps other machinery,\nbut that, to repeat, is an epistemological point. The fact that \\(p\\)\nis a theorem of \\(D\\) is a fact about a deductive system, namely that\nthere is a sequence of formulas starting from axioms and proceeding by\nrules of the system concluding in \\(p\\). As the deductivist sees\nit\u2014as she has to see it, to avoid the\nregress\u2014this fact is not mathematical, even if we must\nuse mathematics to determine whether it holds or not. (Compare the\nclaim that a large meteor will land on Earth before 2050: a physical\nfact, but one we verify or falsify using sophisticated\nmathematics.)\n\nIn short, to avoid the regress, deductivists should not apply their\ninterpretation strategy to claims of deductive consequence. For any\nsentence \\(s\\) and well-specified deductive system \\(D\\), whether\n\\(D\\) proves \\(s\\) or not should be taken to be a determinate fact.\nSuch facts are the cornerstone of her philosophy and should not be\n\u201cdeductivised\u201d. Rather than have the deductivist recipe\napplied to them, they must be taken at face\n value.[15]\n8. Applications\n\nThe fourth challenge concerns applications.\n \u00a72\n mentioned that deductivism appears to provide a straightforward\naccount of the applicability of mathematics: provided a physical\nsystem satisfies the axioms of a particular branch of mathematics, the\nbranch\u2019s theorems must apply to the physical system. But what\nexactly does it mean for a system to satisfy an axiom? The simplest\naccount of applications is the mapping or isomorphism account. Given a\nphysical set-up \\(P\\), stipulate an isomorphism from \\(P\\) to some\nmathematical structure \\(M\\), deduce some facts about \\(M\\), and then,\napplying the isomorphism in the reverse direction, read off the\ncorresponding facts about \\(P\\). Resnik (1980, 125), following Russell\nand Putnam, worries that this account is knee-deep in\nmathematics\u2014for what is an isomorphism if not a mathematical\nobject? More generally, a satisfactory account of mathematical\napplications will have to employ mathematics to explain how\nmathematics relates to the physical\n world.[16]\n\nThis is a major concern that applies to a host of other philosophies.\nAll anti-platonists must set out how to understand the mathematics\nitself used to explain the applicability of mathematics. Eliminative\nstructuralists must give an account of the mathematics relating\nstructures to the physical world. Nominalists must likewise explain\nhow scientific theories laden with commitment to abstract objects can\ncorrectly depict the physical facts despite there being no abstract\nobjects. Each specific anti-platonism seems to face some version of\nthis general problem. Allowing the use of mathematics in the\nmetatheory enables a philosophy to relate mathematics and the natural\nworld; disallowing it appears to hamstring a philosophy\u2014or so\nthis challenge maintains.\n\nSo can the deductivist explain mathematics\u2019 applicability?\nPerhaps her best hope of doing so is by means of a combined\nmathematical-scientific \u201ctotal\u201d theory, which we may call\nTT. TT incorporates all the axioms of mathematics,\nas well as established scientific principles and data. Through its\ncombination of mathematics and science, TT is able to posit\nall sorts of relations between mathematical \u201cstructures\u201d\nand physical situations and thereby explain mathematical applications\n(at least as well as anyone can). The truth-conditions of physical\nclaims derivable from TT should be understood in the usual\nreferential manner, as relating to the physical world; whereas the\ntruth-conditions of mathematical claims should, for the deductivist,\nbe understood as above, namely as claims of the form \u201c\\(p\\) is\ndeducible from TT\u201d. Importantly, for the deductivist,\n\u201cstructures\u201d and \u201cisomorphisms\u201d are to be\nunderstood deductively within the theory TT. Effectively, the\ndeductivist internalises model theory into the deductive\nframework.\n\nThis response looks like it dispatches the challenge from\napplications. Mathematics and science can be discussed and compared\nwithin the single overarching theory, TT. However, the\nresponse has an Achilles heel: mixed statements. The deductivist\nconstrues talk of numbers in deductivist fashion and talk of chairs\n(say) in straightforwardly literal fashion. So what is she to make of\na claim such as \u201cMy favourite things are the number 7 and this\nchair\u201d? The claim cannot be read literally, as it involves\nreference to a number; nor should it be read in deductivist fashion,\nsince it involves reference to a concrete entity, a particular chair.\nThat a chair is one of my favourite things is a claim with empirical\ncontent, to be taken literally. The sentence \u201cmy favourite\nthings are the number 7 and this chair\u201d is of course a toy\nexample. The point applies much more widely, since mathematics is\nseamlessly interwoven with ordinary and (especially) scientific\nlanguage.\n\nThe deductivist therefore owes us a recipe for cleaving the\nmathematical from the non-mathematical in all mixed statements. This\nis a problem faced by other anti-platonist approaches, for example by\nfictionalists about mathematics such as Mary\n Leng.[17]\n They take applied mathematics to be an \u201cextended fiction\u201d\nthat combines the (alleged) fiction of mathematics with science, which\nthey construe literally (as it is about the physical world). But which\nis which, where do we draw the line, and how do we deal with\nstatements mixing fiction and the literal, apparently inextricably?\nFinding good answers to the corresponding questions is a significant\nchallenge for deductivists just as much as it is for\nfictionalists.\n9. Truth-Completeness\n\nWe move on to the fifth and final challenge to deductivism. One\nversion of it, owed to Michael Resnik, runs as\n follows.[18]\n Consider the deductivist\u2019s set theory \\(T\\) and its G\u00f6del\nsentence \\(G_T\\). By construction, \\(G_T\\) is not derivable from\n\\(T\\). So the deductivist cannot explain the truth of \\(G_T\\).\nResnik\u2019s response: the deductivist can simply challenge the\nantideductivist to explain how she \u201csees\u201d the truth of\n\\(G_T\\). Whatever mathematical argument the antideductivist offers,\nthe deductivist can simply extract from it an axiom set \\(T^{+}\\) and\npoint out that \\(G_T\\) follows from \\(T^{+}\\). Objection parried.\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem does create a\nsignificant problem for deductivism; but it is not the one just\nformulated and responded to. The above version focuses on how, given a\nparticular theory \\((T)\\), we are supposed to appreciate the truth of\nits G\u00f6del sentence \\((G_T)\\). A stronger form of the objection\ncasts it in more global terms and brackets the issue of the G\u00f6del\nsentence\u2019s truth. What deductivism appears to get wrong is that\nit disrespects the entrenched understanding of most parts of\nmathematics as truth-complete: for any precisely formulated\nsentence \\(p\\) from a truth-complete area of mathematics, exactly one\nof \\(p\\) and not-p is true. Analysis and arithmetic are\nexamples of areas standardly understood to be truth-complete. It is\nstandardly thought, for example, that a statement such as\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture is true or false, even if it turns out to\nbe unprovable from any reasonable axioms, not just present\n ones.[19]\n But on the deductivist view, undecidable sentences in any\nformalisation of arithmetic and analysis are false and their negations\nare also false, since neither deductively follows from the axioms.\nThat there are undecidable sentences follows from G\u00f6del\u2019s\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem together with standard constraints on\ndeductive\n systems.[20]\n Hence deductivism misdescribes our understanding of truth-complete\nbranches of mathematics such as arithmetic, analysis and geometry.\n\nThis objection seems to affect two of the three variants of\ndeductivism we identified at the end of\n \u00a74:\n local deductivism and ZFC-deductivism. A form of deductivism the\nG\u00f6delian objection does not affect is constructivist deductivism,\nbecause constructivists do not assume the law of excluded middle in\nmathematics, so do not assume truth-completeness. Though, as we\nglimpsed in the discussion of Brouwer\n (\u00a73.5),\n constructivists do not tend to be deductivists.\n\nSticking to classical-logic-using deductivism, its proponent could\nrespond to the objection by idealising the axiom system or the proof\nsystem or both. The first approach is to construe \u201c\\(2 + 2 =\n4\\)\u201d as:\n\n\nthe sentence \u201c\\(2 + 2 = 4\\)\u201d deductively follows from the\nideal axioms of arithmetic\n\n\nThe resulting position is essentially whatever-it-takes deductivism,\nmentioned in\n \u00a74.\n It adds a little more detail to the position articulated in\n \u00a74\n in that the ideal axioms of arithmetic by stipulation give rise to a\ncomplete system, in order to overcome the present objection. (Of\ncourse, an informal version of whatever-it-takes deductivism would\nevade the objection altogether, because it is not based on a formal\nsystem. But critics will retort that it does so only because its\naccount of mathematical truth is inherently vague.) The second sort of\napproach might, for example, take the proof system to include\ninfinitary rules of reasoning, such as the omega-rule, which, as is\nwell-known, restores completeness if added to first-order Peano\n Arithmetic.[21]\n\nIdealising deductivism in either of these ways, however, is not to\nrescue but to abandon it. Any combined axiom-and-proof system that is\nconsistent, deductively complete and strong enough to capture all the\ntruths of mathematics lacks an effective proof procedure, by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem. To see this, consider\nsay the deductive \u201csystem\u201d whose \u201ctheorems\u201d\nconsist of all the true sentences of\n arithmetic.[22]\n Assuming the Church\u2013Turing thesis, this list of\n\u201ctheorems\u201d cannot be generated by any mechanical proof\nprocedure (i.e., algorithm). Idealised deductivism is thus eliminative\nstructuralism in thin disguise, since it advocates taking as the\ncombined axiom-and-proof system whatever it takes to capture the\nstructural content of the axioms, be it by beefing up the axioms or\nthe \u201cproof\u201d system or both. If the idea is that\nmathematicians take a sentence to be true if and only if it is a\nlogical consequence of the semantic content of\nstructure-characterising axioms, one should come clean and accept\ndeductivism\u2019s semantic counterpart: eliminative structuralism.\nThe clear moral is that what lands deductivism in trouble is its focus\non syntax. Instead of taking a syntactic turn as it did in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the \u201cmathematical\nstatements are conditional on axioms\u201d idea must instead take a\nsemantic form.\n\nDeductivists might try another defence. We quoted Curry in\n \u00a73.4\n as holding that \u201call formal systems stand on a par\u201d. And\nthis is surely a thought many deductivists will find attractive: in\nprinciple, any formal system is acceptable, the differences between\none formal system and another being owed to the fact that one of them\nis better suited to applications, or to the fact that one of the\nsystems happens to be the one \\(we\\) use, and so on. So, for the\ndeductivist, if the axioms of arithmetic \\(Ax\\) we explicitly or\nimplicitly accept are incomplete, then any arithmetical sentence \\(p\\)\nnot decided by them is neither true nor false, precisely because its\ntruth-value is relativised to deducibility from \\(Ax\\). Of course, we\ncan strengthen \\(Ax\\) in one way to derive \\(p\\) and in another way to\nderive not-\\(p\\), and in those respective strengthenings \\(p\\) will be\nrespectively true and false. This, it appears, is Curry\u2019s\nsuggestion about how deductivists should react to G\u00f6del\u2019s\nresult.\n\nThe resulting pluralist position rejects truth-completeness for a\nprincipled reason. But it rejects it nonetheless, and that must count\nas a significant cost. For the truth-completeness of arithmetic is a\nfundamental commitment of mathematics, and permeates most of our\nthinking about the natural numbers. (A similar point applies to many\nother areas.) Some would say that respecting it is a non-negotiable\nconstraint on a philosophy of mathematics. Of course, the\ntruth-completeness objection challenges deductivism only in certain\nareas of mathematics\u2014specifically those typically held to be\ntruth-complete but for which no deductively complete, consistent\naxiomatisation exists. A complete theory-axiomatisation may be\nprovided even in first-order logic not just for finite structures but\nfor some infinite ones as\n well.[23]\n Thus one could still try to defend a deductivism about all other\nareas. But there is great value in having a uniform philosophy of\nmathematics. More importantly, given deductivism\u2019s motivations,\nas outlined in\n \u00a72,\n it is hard to see what the point of this sort of eclectic deductivism\nmight be.\n\nTruth-completeness presents the deductivist with a formidable\nchallenge. To meet it, she cannot privilege any system of arithmetic\nover any other by maintaining that \u201cPA is consistent\u201d is\ntrue in one system and false in another. The post-G\u00f6delian\nrealisation that eliminative structuralism fares better\nhere\u2014because it allows for the possibility of truth-completeness\nif we move to an incompletable semantic consequence relation\u2014led\nto structuralism\u2019s gain in popularity at the expense of\ndeductivism in the second half of the twentieth century.",
