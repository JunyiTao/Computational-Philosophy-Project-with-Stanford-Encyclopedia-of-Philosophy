    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nFell\u2019s long life spanned the reigns of six English monarchs\nand some of the most dramatic political events in English history,\nincluding the Civil Wars of 1642\u201351 and the Glorious Revolution of\n1688\u201389. Fell (n\u00e9e Askew) was born at Marsh Grange,\nDalton-in-Furness, in Lancashire, England, in 1614, and she died in\n1702. At the age of seventeen, she married the barrister Thomas Fell\n(c. 1598\u20131658) and together they had nine children. In 1652,\nupon his return home, Thomas Fell was greeted by neighbors who warned\nhim that his wife had been bewitched by a travelling preacher. This\npreacher was George Fox (1624\u201391), a charismatic religious dissenter\nand first-generation leader of the Society of Friends (also known as\nQuakers). Upon hearing Fox speak at her local church, Margaret Fell\ntestified that\n\n\nIt pleased the Lord so to open my understanding Imediately in the\ntime of G Fs [George Fox\u2019s] declaration. That I saw perfectly\nJust then that wee were all wrong, & that we were but Theives,\nthat had stollen the scriptures. which caused me to shed many tears.\nAnd I satt down in my pew & wept all the while \u2026 (Glines\n2003, 430).\n\n\n\nFrom that day forward, Margaret Fell was a convert to Quakerism.\nDespite his initial reservations, Thomas Fell was supportive of his\nwife\u2019s conversion, and the Fell family home of Swarthmoor Hall\nbecame a popular meeting place for Friends. In these early years, while\nThomas Fell was chief magistrate of the area, the northern Quakers seem\nto have avoided persecution. Though Margaret Fell eventually suffered\nimprisonment for her beliefs, she remained a woman of considerable\nwealth and social status throughout her life.\n\n\nTogether with Fox and William Penn (1644\u20131718), Fell is now regarded\nas one of the founders of Quakerism. She helped to sustain the movement\nthrough her large correspondence with other Friends on a range of\npersonal and religio-political topics. She travelled widely and spent\nextended periods in London petitioning the political authorities on\nbehalf of persecuted Quakers; she personally addressed not only Oliver\nCromwell but also Charles II and James II. And on at least three\noccasions, she spent periods in prison for holding Quaker meetings at\nher house and for refusing to take the Oath of Allegiance. Fell married\nGeorge Fox in 1669, eleven years after her first husband\u2019s death,\nand she was subsequently known as Margaret Fox. Together they were\nactive organizers of the separate Quaker women\u2019s meetings, first\nofficially begun in 1671.\n\n\nNot long after her conversion, Fell began to express her Quaker\nbeliefs in print, starting with False Prophets, Antichrists,\nDeceivers in 1655. She was the author (or co-author) of at least\n23 works in total, mostly in the form of short pamphlets. Some of her\nmore substantial works\u2014including A Call to the Universall\nSeed of God (1665), Womens Speaking Justified (1666;\nsecond edition, 1667), and A Touch-Stone: or, A Perfect Tryal by\nthe Scriptures (1667)\u2014were written during the period of her\nimprisonment in Lancaster Castle (1664\u201368). Following her death,\nseveral of her works were collected together and published as A\nBrief Collection of Remarkable Passages and Occurrences (1710).\nDespite its 535 pages, this collection is nevertheless incomplete and\nincludes only a small sample of letters. Her works are now available in\ntheir original form in online databases such as Early English Books\nOnline, or in selective modern anthologies such as Wallace (1992),\nBooy (2004), and Garman et al. (1996). Elsa F. Glines has\npublished 164 of Fell\u2019s surviving letters in her collection\nThe Letters of Margaret Fell (2003).\n",
