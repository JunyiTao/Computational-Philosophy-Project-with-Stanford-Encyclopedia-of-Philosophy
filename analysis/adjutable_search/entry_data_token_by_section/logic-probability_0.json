    "main_text": "Combining Logic and Probability Theory\n1. Combining Logic and Probability Theory\n\nThe very idea of combining logic and probability might look strange at\nfirst sight (H\u00e1jek 2001). After all, logic is concerned with\nabsolutely certain truths and inferences, whereas probability theory\ndeals with uncertainties. Furthermore, logic offers a\nqualitative (structural) perspective on inference (the\ndeductive validity of an argument is based on the argument\u2019s\nformal structure), whereas probabilities are quantitative\n(numerical) in nature. However, as will be shown in the next section,\nthere are natural senses in which probability theory\npresupposes and extends classical logic.\nFurthermore, historically speaking, several distinguished theorists\nsuch as De Morgan (1847), Boole (1854), Ramsey (1926), de Finetti\n(1937), Carnap (1950), Jeffrey (1992) and Howson (2003, 2007, 2009)\nhave emphasized the tight connections between logic and probability,\nor even considered their work on probability as a part of logic\nitself.\n\nBy integrating the complementary perspectives of qualitative logic and\nnumerical probability theory, probability logics are able to offer\nhighly expressive accounts of inference. It should therefore come as\nno surprise that they have been applied in all fields that study\nreasoning mechanisms, such as philosophy, artificial intelligence,\ncognitive science and mathematics. The downside to this\ncross-disciplinary popularity is that terms such as \u2018probability\nlogic\u2019 are used by different researchers in different,\nnon-equivalent ways. Therefore, before moving on to the actual\ndiscussion of the various approaches, we will first delineate the\nsubject matter of this entry.\n\nThe most important distinction is that between probability\nlogic and inductive logic. Classically, an argument is\nsaid to be (deductively) valid if and only if it is\nimpossible that the premises of \\(A\\) are all true, while its\nconclusion is false. In other words, deductive validity amounts to\ntruth preservation: in a valid argument, the truth of the\npremises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In some arguments,\nhowever, the truth of the premises does not fully guarantee the truth\nof the conclusion, but it still renders it highly likely. A typical\nexample is the argument with premises \u2018The first swan I saw was\nwhite\u2019, \u2026, \u2018The 1000th swan I saw was white\u2019,\nand conclusion \u2018All swans are white\u2019. Such arguments are\nstudied in inductive logic, which makes extensive use of\nprobabilistic notions, and is therefore considered by some authors to\nbe related to probability logic. There is some discussion about the\nexact relation between inductive logic and probability logic, which is\nsummarized in the introduction of Kyburg (1994). The dominant position\n(defended by Adams and Levine (1975), among others), which is also\nadopted here, is that probability logic entirely belongs to deductive\nlogic, and hence should not be concerned with inductive reasoning.\nStill, most work on inductive logic falls within the\n\u2018probability preservation\u2019 approach, and is thus closely\nconnected to the systems discussed in\n Section 2.\n For more on inductive logic, the reader can consult Jaynes (2003),\nFitelson (2006), Romeijn (2011), and the entries on\n the problem of induction\n and\n inductive logic\n of this encyclopedia.\n\nWe will also steer clear of the philosophical debate over the exact\nnature of probability. The formal systems discussed here are\ncompatible with all of the common interpretations of probability, but\nobviously, in concrete applications, certain interpretations of\nprobability will fit more naturally than others. For example, the\nmodal probability logics discussed in \n Section 4\n are, by themselves, neutral about the nature of probability, but when\nthey are used to describe the behavior of a transition system, their\nprobabilities are typically interpreted in an objective way, whereas\nmodeling multi-agent scenarios is accompanied most naturally by a\nsubjective interpretation of probabilities (as agents\u2019 degrees\nof belief). This topic is covered in detail in Gillies (2000), Eagle\n(2010), and the entry on\n interpretations of probability\n of this encyclopedia.\n\nA recent trend in the literature has been to focus less on integrating\nor combining logic and probability theory into a single, unified\nframework, but rather to establish bridges between the two\ndisciplines. This typically involves trying to capture the qualitative\nnotions of logic in the quantitative terms of probability theory, or\nthe other way around. We will not be able to do justice to the wide\nvariety of approaches in this booming area, but interested readers can\nconsult Leitgeb (2013, 2014), Lin and Kelly (2012a, 2012b), Douven and\nRott (2018), and Harrison-Trainor, Holliday and Icard (2016, 2018). A\n\u2018contemporary classic\u2019 in this area is Leitgeb (2017),\nwhile van Benthem (2017) offers a useful survey and some interesting\nprogrammatic remarks.\n\nFinally, although the success of probability logic is largely due to\nits various applications, we will not deal with these applications in\nany detail. For example, we will not assess the use of probability as\na formal representation of belief in philosophy (Bayesian\nepistemology) or artificial intelligence (knowledge representation),\nand its advantages and disadvantages with respect to alternative\nrepresentations, such as generalized probability theory (for quantum\ntheory), \\(p\\)-adic probability, and fuzzy logic. For more information\nabout these topics, the reader can consult Gerla (1994), Vennekens et\nal. (2009), H\u00e1jek and Hartmann (2010), Hartmann and Sprenger\n(2010), Ili\u0107-Stepi\u0107 et al.\u00a0(2012), and the entries on\n formal representations of belief,\n Bayesian epistemology,\n defeasible reasoning,\n quantum logic and probability theory, and\n fuzzy logic\n of this encyclopedia.\n\nWith these clarifications in place, we are now ready to look at what\nwill be discussed in this entry. The most common strategy to\nobtain a concrete system of probability logic is to start with a\nclassical (propositional/modal/etc.) system of logic and to\n\u2018probabilify\u2019 it in one way or another, by adding\nprobabilistic features to it. There are various ways in which this\nprobabilification can be implemented. One can study probabilistic\nsemantics for classical languages (which do not have any explicit\nprobabilistic operators), in which case the consequence relation\nitself gets a probabilistic flavor: deductive validity becomes\n\u2018probability preservation\u2019, rather than \u2018truth\npreservation\u2019. This direction will be discussed in \n Section 2. \n Alternatively, one can add various kinds of probabilistic\noperators to the syntax of the logic. In \n Section 3\n we will discuss some initial, rather basic examples of probabilistic\noperators. The full expressivity of modal probabilistic operators will\nbe explored in \n Section 4. \nFinally, languages with first-order probabilistic operators will be\ndiscussed in \n Section 5.\n",
