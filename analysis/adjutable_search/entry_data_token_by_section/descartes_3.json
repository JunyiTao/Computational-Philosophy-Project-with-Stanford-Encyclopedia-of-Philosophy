This was the\nMeditations, and presumably he was revising or recasting the\nLatin treatise from 1629 and elaborating on Discourse IV. He\ntold Mersenne of his plan to provide the work to \u201cthe twenty or\nthirty most learned theologians\u201d so as to gauge their responses\nbefore publication. Ultimately, he and Mersenne collected seven sets\nof objections to the Meditations, which Descartes published\nwith the work, along with his replies (1641, 1642). Some objections\nwere from unnamed theologians, passed on by Mersenne; one set came\nfrom the Dutch priest Johannes Caterus; one set was from the Jesuit\nphilosopher Pierre Bourdin; others were from Mersenne himself, from\nthe philosophers Pierre Gassendi and Thomas Hobbes, and from the\nCatholic philosopher-theologian Antoine Arnauld.\n\nRecall that Descartes considered the Meditations to contain\nthe principles of his physics. But there is no Meditation labeled\n\u201cprinciples of physics.\u201d The principles in question, which\nare spread through the work, concern the nature of matter, the\nactivity of God in creating and conserving the world, the nature of\nmind (that it is an unextended, thinking substance), mind\u2013body\nunion and interaction, and the ontology of sensory qualities.\n\nOnce Descartes had presented his metaphysics, he felt free to move\nbeyond the published samples of his physics and to present the whole\nof his conception of nature. But he needed first \u201cto teach it to\nspeak Latin\u201d (3:523), the lingua franca of the seventeenth\ncentury (recall that his World was in French). He hatched a\nscheme to publish a Latin version of his physics (the\nPrinciples) accompanied by a scholastic Aristotelian work on\nphysics, so as to make the comparative advantages manifest. He chose\nthe Summa philosophiae of Eustace of St. Paul. That part of\nhis plan never came to fruition. His intent remained the same: he\nwished to produce a book that could be adopted in the schools, even\nJesuit schools such as La Fl\u00e8che (3:233, 523; 4:224).\nUltimately, his physics was taught in the Netherlands, France,\nEngland, and parts of Germany. For the Catholic lands, the teaching of\nhis philosophy was dampened when his works were placed on the Index of\nProhibited Books in 1663, although his followers in France, such as\nJacques Rohault (1618\u201372) and Pierre Regis (1632\u20131707),\ncontinued to promote Descartes\u2019 natural philosophy.\n\nThe Principles appeared in Latin in 1644, with a French\ntranslation in 1647. Descartes added to the translation an\n\u201cAuthor\u2019s Letter\u201d as a preface. The letter explained\nimportant aspects of his attitude toward philosophy, including the\nview that, in matters philosophical, one must reason through the\narguments and evaluate them for one\u2019s self (9B:3). He also\npresented an image of the relations among the various parts of\nphilosophy, in the form of a tree:\n\nThus the whole of philosophy is like a tree. The roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. By\n\u201cmorals\u201d I understand the highest and most perfect moral\nsystem, which presupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences\nand is the ultimate level of wisdom. (9B:14)\n\n\nThe extant Principles offers metaphysics in Part I; the\ngeneral principles of physics, in the form of his matter theory and\nlaws of motion, as following from the metaphysics, in Part II; Part\nIII concerns astronomical phenomena; and Part IV covers the formation\nof the earth and seeks to explain the properties of minerals, metals,\nmagnets, fire, and the like, to which are appended discussions of how\nthe senses operate and a final discussion of methodological issues in\nnatural philosophy. His intent had been also to explain in depth the\norigins of plants and animals, human physiology, mind\u2013body union\nand interaction, and the function of the senses. (Descartes and his\nfollowers variously included topics concerning the nature of the mind\nand mind\u2013body interaction within physics or natural philosophy,\non which, see Hatfield 2000.) In the end, he had to abandon the\ndiscussion of plants and animals (Princ. IV.188), but he\nincluded some discussion of mind\u2013body union in his abbreviated\naccount of the senses.\n",
