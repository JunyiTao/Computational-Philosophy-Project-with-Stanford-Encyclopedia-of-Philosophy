This work addresses meritocracy as a theory of justice\n (\u00a74),\n and is largely critical (e.g., Carneval et al. 2020; Littler 2018;\nMandler 2020; Markovits 2019; and Sandel 2020).\n\nThe public debate tends to be convoluted for two reasons. First,\ncommentators often fail to make clear what they mean by\n\u201cmeritocracy\u201d. The meritocratic ideal is more or less\ncompelling depending on how it is defined (e.g., with robust equal\nopportunity or without). To avoid talking past each other, it is\ncritical that commentators have a common definition in mind.\n\nSecond, one sees the classic conflation of the normative and the\npositive. This entry is concerned with the normative question:\nOught we live in a meritocracy? (Or, almost equivalently, is\nmeritocracy just?)\n\nBut then there is the positive question: Is the world\nmeritocratic? Do people enjoy equal opportunity? All else equal, do\npoor children and rich children face equal prospects? Are jobs and\nincome being distributed on the basis of merit? Or are\nnon-meritocratic features\u2014race, gender, family connections,\nappearance, luck, and so on\u2014playing roles as well?\n\nIt is useful to partition commentators on meritocracy along the\nnormative/positive dimensions. Some commentators (e.g., Mankiw [2013])\nbelieve that meritocracy is both desirable and largely realized in the\nactual world. Others (Mulligan [2018b]) think that meritocracy is\ndesirable but that we do not live in one. Still others (Markovits\n[2019]) say that we live in a meritocracy and that this is a bad\nthing. Finally, there are some (Gheaus [2015]) who think that\nmeritocracy is neither achieved nor a worthy ideal in the first\nplace.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the way perceptions of merit affect\nthe public\u2019s normative evaluation of policy. Consider\naffirmative action. While divisive, many supporters of affirmative\naction and many opponents appear to agree morally: Both want the most\nmeritorious applicant to be hired. What they disagree about is whether\naffirmative action contributes to or detracts from this shared goal.\nSupporters think that affirmative action nullifies racial bias and\nother forms of disadvantage, ensuring that the most meritorious\napplicant gets hired. Opponents of affirmative action think that the\npolicy violates meritocratic hiring by giving some applicants\nadvantage (and others, perforce, disadvantage) on the basis of race\n(see, e.g., Reyna et al. 2005).\n\nAs Suhay, Tenenbaum, and Bartola describe things,\n\n\nEven controlling for partisanship and various demographic\ncharacteristics, perceptions of whether the U.S. economy is\nmeritocratic are strongly associated with people\u2019s views on\ntaxation, social welfare policy, affirmative action, and presidential\ncandidates\u2026. If citizens could develop a shared understanding\nof the ways in which the American economy fails to deliver\nmeritocratic outcomes, perhaps they would demand the two parties find\ncommon ground on policies designed to combat inequality. (2022: 9\nff.)\n\n\nThe way the public perceives social and economic realities\u2014as\nmeritocratic or not\u2014appears to play a crucial role in their\nmoral assessment of those realities.\n\nA curious feature of the debate is how both opponents and supporters\nof meritocracy appeal to the same facts in making their cases. Michael\nSandel (2020), for example, attacks today\u2019s culture of\n\u201ccredentialism\u201d (also known as \u201cpedigree\u201d), in\nwhich a diploma from an elite college is a de facto\nrequirement for entry into elite professions. Frequently, a less\nmeritorious but credentialed person (from, say, Harvard) is preferred\nto a more meritorious but uncredentialed person (UMass). Credentialism\nis, by Sandel\u2019s lights, a feature of meritocracy.\n\nMulligan (2018b) also attacks credentialism, arguing that meritocracy\nis the solution to it rather than its cause. A Harvard education is\nnot markedly better than a UMass education, but the returns to a\nHarvard education are enormously better than the returns to a UMass\neducation. The returns to a Harvard education are, thus, largely rent\n (\u00a74.3),\n and so credentialism is unmeritocratic.\n\nThe meritocracy debate is, to put it mildly, unsettled. This is a\nreflection of its philosophical richness. While meritocratic ideas\nhave been expressed and implemented for millennia, we still struggle\nto say exactly what meritocracy is and if it is desirable. We do not\nhave full answers to those questions. But perhaps we are now, at\nleast, beginning to understand them.\n",
