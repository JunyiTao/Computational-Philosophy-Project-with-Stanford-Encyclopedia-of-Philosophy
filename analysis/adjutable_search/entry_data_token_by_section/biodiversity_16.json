    "main_text": "The Conservation Biology Framing || Biodiversity eliminativism\n5.3 Biodiversity eliminativism\n\nWhile biodiversity has been accepted as a core goal of modern\nconservation science, there is some scepticism in the philosophical\nliterature toward the utility of this concept. A series of\nphilosophers have argued that the biodiversity concept is detrimental\nto environmental efforts (Maier 2012; Santana 2014, 2018; Morar,\nToadvine, & Bohannan 2015). These arguments tend to coalesce\naround several points: that the biodiversity concept not\noperationalizable, biodiversity is not desirable, and that the concept\nobscures many of the values people have towards nature. The argument\nis that, either the concept cannot be used, or it may be used, but\nwith recognition that it does not represent our ethical interest in\nthe environment.\n\nThe belief that biodiversity cannot be adequately operationalized has\nappeared numerous times through the literature. Some argue that\noperationalizing biodiversity requires a \u201cdiversity\u201d\nmeasure, or set of measures, both represent the concept of\nbiodiversity and not be contradictory in its recommendations about\nwhat to conserve. Bryan Norton early on suggested that\n\n\nstrong arguments show that an index that captures all that is\nlegitimately included as biodiversity is not possible. Biodiversity\ncannot be made a measurable quantity. (Norton 2008: 373)\n\n\nThis is because many of the different scientific measures for\nbiodiversity are incommensurable, clashing with each other. For\nexample: an area of possessing populations that are highly\nfunctionally distinct may be quite species poor. Some take the\napparent incommensurability of biodiversity measures to show that\nmeasures should be used in context sensitive instances either relative\nto the development of conservation science or to the local interests\nof stakeholders (Koricheva & Siipi 2004; Sarkar 2005; Maclaurin\n& Sterelny 2008). An alternative considered is that we should\nnarrow down the list of measures to that are most important according\nto some desiderata (Maclaurin & Sterelny 2008; Lean 2017; Meinard,\nCoq, & Schmid 2019).\n\nEven if \u201cbiodiversity\u201d was made to be tractable (in the\nsense used above), eliminativists are suspicious of biological\ndiversity being regarded as valuable. Diversity across different\nbiological arrangements is even argued to be undesirable. Maier points\nto diversity of parasites and diseases being undesirable (Maier 2012).\nDiversity sometimes reduces the value of taxa as the rarity of a\nspecies tends to increase its value (Santana 2014). Morar, Toadvine,\nand Bohannan (2015) explain this is because it is \u201cnot\nlife\u2019s variety but rather life itself\u201d (2015: 24) that is\nvaluable (without making reference to insurance and options values of\nvariety). The perception of a mismatch between ethical interests in\nthe environment and diversity is emphasised by all eliminativists.\n\nEliminativists believe \u201cbiodiversity\u201d has mislead\nconservation, as the concept and term was designed to be exhaustive of\nhuman interests in the environment\u2014and it cannot succeed in this\ntask. The idea that biodiversity was designed to represent all human\nvalues of the environment appears in Maier\u2019s work as \u201cthe\nbiodiversity project\u201d, Santana argues that biodiversity is just\nan intermediary for \u201cecological value\u201d, and Morar,\nToadvine, and Bohannan argue that biodiversity \u201cdoes not exhaust\nwhat we value in the natural world\u201d (2015: 24). Santana (2014)\nprovides a clear presentation of this belief and uses it to argue that\nbiodiversity is a misleading and unnecessary step in conservation\nplanning. Biodiversity acts in conservation as an intermediary between\nall the ways we value the environment and the implementation of\nsurrogate measures for these values, which are then used in\nconservation planning. Santana suggests we should remove the step of\nconsidering biodiversity and directly represent our values in the\nenvironment without considering diversity (see also SEP\n conservation biology\n entry)\n\nThis perspective differs from other frameworks for understanding\nbiodiversity (including the focus on variety, originating in the\npre-history of the term), which consider biodiversity as just one of\nseveral different conservation values which may trade off against each\nother (Faith 1995; Norton 2015; Lean 2017). One may choose to\nprioritise wilderness, or ecosystem services, over biodiversity and\ndecision theoretic measures will be used to weight such\nconsiderations.\n\nIt is argued by some that biodiversity not only doesn\u2019t\nrepresent all the ways the public values nature, it may also hinder\nthe public\u2019s engagement in nature. As a scientific\n\u201cproxy\u201d for natures value it is viewed as a dangerous case\nof scientism (Morar, Toadvine, & Bohannan 2015; Sarkar 2019). By\nhaving the \u201cveneer of objectivity\u201d it masks the normative\ndimension of conservation. The argument is that this can lead to an\nattitude of leave it to the scientists and shift the responsibility\naway from the policymakers and the public (Morar, Toadvine, &\nBohannan 2015). This is interpreted as representing a dangerous\nimpediment to the democratic dimension of conservation. This is\nregarded as an interesting question for the interface between\nconservation theory and public policy.\n\nEliminativism proposes that there are tensions in the use of the\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d concept, posing the idea that there is a\nmismatch between the scientific measures of biodiversity and the\nnormative role it plays in conservation science. This perspective\ntherefore contrasts strongly with the historical \u201cvariety\u201d\nframing (above), where the scientific measure of biodiversity as\nvariety, and its recognised value to humanity, is the source of\nnormativity\n claims.[3]\n Eliminativists argue that, while it would be hard to remove\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d from use in conservation, this is necessary\nto allow for a clearer connection between humanities interests in the\nenvironment and conservation practice (also see the section on\n eliminating biodiversity in the entry on conservation biology).\n",
