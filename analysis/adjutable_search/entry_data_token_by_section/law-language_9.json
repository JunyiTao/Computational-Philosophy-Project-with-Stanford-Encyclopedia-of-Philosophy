In focusing their\nattention on the meaning of the main terms of legal discourse, Bentham\nand John Austin were ahead of their time. But it has come to be a\ncommonplace view in legal theory (though still controversial) that\nthey were misguided in attempting to define those terms. So, for\nexample, Hart in the 1960s rejected definition as a useful technique\nin philosophy of law (Hart 2012, 14\u201317). Dworkin in the 1980s\naccused Hart of only repackaging the same approach as the \u2018more\ncandidly definitional\u2019 method of John Austin (Dworkin 1986,\n32\u201333). And Richard Posner in the 1990s accused both Hart and\nDworkin of pointlessly \u201ctrying to define\n\u2018law\u2019\u201d (Posner 1996, vii).\n\nThere is no reason to describe the work of either Hart or Dworkin as\ndefining the word \u2018law\u2019. And defining that word would not\nsolve any of the problems of jurisprudence (as Hart pointed out). The\nfundamental reason is that the legal philosophers\u2019 problems and\ntheir disputes would not be resolved by a statement of the meaning of\nthe word \u2018law\u2019 that would be useful to someone who did not\nknow it. Philosophers of law cannot solve their problems by giving a\ndefinition of the word \u2018law\u2019, any more than philosophers\nof language can solve their problems by giving a definition of the\nword \u2018language\u2019 (for discussion of the implications for\nlegal philosophy of the semantics and metasemantics of the word\n\u2018law\u2019, see Coleman and Simchen 2003).\n\nA further reason is that, as John Finnis and Ronald Dworkin have both\nexplained in different ways, the word \u2018law\u2019 can be used in\na variety of senses: the law of the jungle, the law of gravity, laws\nof thought, Murphy\u2019s law, etc. (Finnis 1980, 6; Dworkin 1986,\n104). A definition would have to allow for those senses. It might be\nan intriguing (and arduous) study in culture and human thought to\nexplain the analogies among those senses, but it is a study that holds\nout no special promise for understanding the law of a community.\n",
