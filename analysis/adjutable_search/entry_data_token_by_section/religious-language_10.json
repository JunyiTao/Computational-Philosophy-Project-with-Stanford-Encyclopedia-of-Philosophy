    "main_text": "The Use of Religious Language || Religious Purposes\n3.4 Religious Purposes\n\nWe have been looking at theories than characterise the affirmation of\nindicative religious sentences by a type of speech act other than\nliteral assertion. However, some accounts propose that religious\ndiscourse, rather than exhibiting a distinctive type of speech act,\nemploys language for certain distinctive purposes. Possible examples\nof this position include Wittgenstein\u2019s suggestion that a\nreligious judgement should be understood as a picture that has a\nregulative function in guiding practical decisions (1966: 53\u20134)\nand Kant\u2019s proposal that religious utterances communicate\nguidance for how to think (Critique of Pure Reason A671/B699;\nA686/B714). This section will consider the accounts from Ian Ramsey\n(1957) and more recently Rowan Williams (2014).\n\nAccording to Ramsey, full-blooded religious engagement involves two\nthings: a commitment and a discernment. The commitment is an attitude\nthat is directed towards the universe as a whole; it is\n\u201ctotal\u201d and has a particular intensity akin to a personal\nrelationship. The discernment involves a \u201cdisclosure\u201d,\nwhich he describes as a recognition of something of enormous\nimportance. The something in question is not a new fact but a\nrecognition that \u201cbrings together\u201d what is known whereby\none appreciates the world in a new light. For Ramsey, the purpose of\nreligious language is to communicate and promote religious commitment\nand discernment: \u201creligious language talks of the discernment\nwith which is associated, by way of response, a total\ncommitment\u201d (1957: 49). With respect to utterances about God,\nRamsey says: \n\n\nMy suggestion is that we understand their logical behaviour aright if\nwe see them as primarily evocative of what we have called the odd\ndiscernment, that characteristically religious situation which, if\nevoked, provokes a total commitment. (1957: 50)\n\n\nWhen it comes to the details of how to interpret specific religious\nutterances, Ramsey\u2019s proposals are very varied. Some utterances\nhe takes to be expressive of attitudes. Talk of \u201ceternal\npurpose\u201d aims to evoke a sense of \u201ccosmic wonder\u201d\n(1957: 77). Some are metalinguistic claims about the proper use of\nreligious discourse: \n\n\nto say that \u201cGod is impassable\u201d is to claim that the word\n\u201cGod\u201d is a word which cannot be confined to passability\nlanguage. (1957: 89) \n\n\nOthers are about mystery: \n\n\nLet us recognize that the doctrine of the Virgin Birth is essentially\na claim for mystery at Christ\u2019s birth or at Christ\u2019s\ndeath. (1957: 132) \n\n\nHowever, for Ramsey, religious sentences have representational content\nbut are used by speakers in a variety of non-representational\nways\u2014expressive, metalinguistic, to generate a sense of\nmystery\u2014for the purposes of evoking discernment and encouraging\ncommitment, rather than descriptively.\n\nRecently Rowan Williams (2014) has proposed that religious language\nserves to challenge us both morally, by undermining selfishness and\ncomplacency, as well as conceptually by encouraging us to think about\nthe world in different terms. The use of religious language involves\ninnovations that \u201cinvite us to rethink our metaphysical\nprinciples\u201d (2014: 130), undercut \u201cour sense of being a\nfinished subject with a clear agenda of need and desire\u201d (2014:\n152\u20133), and \u201copen us to a truth that is changing us and\nnever leaves us in complacent possession of the power we think we\nhave\u201d (2014: 154). A similar approach is taken to discourse\nabout God. What we are representing in talking of God is not an object\nbut \u201ca particular aspect of every perception, the aspect that\ngives to any specific perception its provisionality, its openness to\nbeing represented afresh\u201d (2014: 148). These purposes can be\nfurthered even by using religious sentences that are not\nconsistent.\n\nFace value theorists will, of course, find much to object to in both\nRamsey\u2019s and Williams\u2019 discussions of religious language.\nOne obvious point to raise is that if engagement in religious\ndiscourse is driven by the purposes that Ramsey and Williams describe\nthen it seems that one need not be concerned with the truth of what\none says. Notably, Williams appears to be sympathetic to the\nendorsement of incoherent claims if they further the broader proposed\npurposes of religious discourse. However, caution is needed in\nclassifying these accounts as descriptive of religious discourse\nrather than revisionary proposals for objectives that speakers might\naim for. If they fall into the latter category, then they are in a\nsimilar position to revolutionary fictionalism.\n",
