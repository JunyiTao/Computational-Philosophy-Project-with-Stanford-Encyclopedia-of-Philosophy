    "main_text": "The First Period: Philosophical Politics || The Republic\n5.2 The Republic\n\nIn the Republic, a work which unfortunately has not come down\nto us complete (none of its six books survive whole, with large\nportions missing especially from the last four), Cicero stakes out his\nposition early with an attack on philosophers who argue that one\nshould refrain from public affairs \u2013 he means principally\nEpicureans. The Stoics, in offering a more activist model, present the\nalternative view. The Stoic philosopher Panaetius, together with the\nGreek historian Polybius, is named in the main body of the dialogue as\nhaving discussed political matters with one of the work\u2019s\nprincipal speakers, Scipio (1.34); and the influence of Stoic\npolitical thinking is evident in the idea that humans share with gods\ndominion not just of the place in which they happen to live, but of\nthe Earth and indeed the whole universe (1.19). Yet this cosmopolitan\noutlook in turn creates tension with the idea, also prominent in the\ndialogue, of the specialness of Rome, and raises the question of\nwhether Roman exceptionalism can sit comfortably with a view of human\nbeings as citizens of the world.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, even before embarking on a discussion of the\nnature of the state, Cicero is explicit in his preface (1.12) about\nthe need to justify participation in public affairs, a stance that\nunderlines his view that theories of good government are all very well\nbut may be idle unless one makes the case that engaging in the public\narena is the right thing to do. Yet, having commended the participant\nover the theoretician, Cicero goes on to say that he will now appeal\nto those who are moved by the authority of philosophers, and declares\nthat in their discussions of government such philosophers have\nthemselves discharged a public office.\n\nThe debate about the role of philosophy is reflected within the main\nbody of the dialogue as well, and here it becomes if anything clearer\nthat Cicero\u2019s purpose is not to play down philosophy but to play\nup the practically oriented way of doing political philosophy that he\nconsiders appropriate to the subject. At the same time, this enables\nhim to present his writing on the topic as genuine progress over his\nGreek predecessors. It may, then, come as a surprise to find, in a\nwork of supposedly practical orientation, that prior to Scipio\u2019s\nmain exposition in Book 1 of the different types of political\nconstitution, Cicero depicts a rather lengthy discussion of a\ncosmological event: the recent apparent sighting of a \u2018second\nsun\u2019 in the sky (1.15).\n\nScipio, even though he will take the lead role in the discussion of\npolitical theory, fulsomely praises the more abstract kinds of study\ndirected at the celestial realm (1.26\u201328); but he is persuaded\nby Laelius, another participant, that it is of greater importance now\nto address terrestrial issues, particularly regarding the best form of\ngovernment (1.30\u201334). The debate that Cicero lays out about the\ninvestigation of the human versus the divine realm makes the case for\nthe study of both as having value, and intriguingly leaves open the\nquestion of the relation between the two: Scipio speaks of how the\nEarth pales into insignificance beside the heavens, and asserts that\nthere is a universal natural law that has authority over any civil\nlaw, so that what has ultimate moral weight is the decree of the wise\nperson who understands the natural law, rather than that of the Roman\npeople (1.27). Similar principles are laid down at 3.33, anticipating\nthe fuller discussion in the Laws. These are pronouncements\nwith a strongly Stoic flavour; and when another participant, Philus,\nspeaks of the Stoic notion that gods and humans share the whole\nuniverse as their homeland, he suggests that for that reason cosmology\nmight be relevant to politics in any case (1.19).\n\nBy the time that we turn to Scipio\u2019s exposition of the various\nforms of government, it can be seen that Cicero has used the\nflexibility of the dramatic dialogue to prime his reader to examine\nthe topic with a critical eye. Scipio\u2019s focus on Rome is a\nresponse to the lack of practical awareness that he (or his author)\nsees infecting Greek models. But if Stoic universalism is correct,\nsuch focus on a particular concrete system seems itself to be headed\nin the wrong direction. And if cosmology is more important than\npolitics, yet too important for politics to ignore, then an exposition\nthat sticks to the human realm \u2013 as Scipio\u2019s, as far as we\ncan tell, largely does \u2013 is missing something. Cicero thus\ninvites us, in the midst of a work on political theory, to consider\nhow small the human (and within that the Roman) domain is, a thought\nreinforced in some complex ways in the dialogue\u2019s concluding\nDream of Scipio, perhaps the most famous excerpt in all of\nCicero\u2019s philosophy (its survival owed to its coming down to us\nas part of a separate manuscript tradition). In thus giving the work\nas a whole structural integrity (despite its, for us, truncated\ncondition), Cicero\u2019s framing challenges the reader to maintain a\ncritical perspective on the doing of political philosophy itself.\n",
