    "main_text": "History || Social and Sociological Theory\n2.1 Social and Sociological Theory\n\nEmile Durkheim (1898) and Max Weber (1922) have developed conceptions\nof collective intentionality under other labels, and they have come to\nquite different and indeed opposite views.\n\nDurkheim claims that social facts have to be accounted for in terms of\ncollective consciousness rather than individual attitudes.\nHis (1898) example of people who are involved in a mass emotion, of\nwhich they cannot make sense in terms of their own personal views and\nfeelings, is often quoted as an illustration. Indeed, Durkheim\u2019s\nview is sometimes even argued to be the direct historical root of the\ncurrent debate on collective intentionality (Olen/Turner 2015).\nDurkheim\u2019s remarks on the role of collective consciousness\nsuggest a view of the collective \u201ctaking over control\u201d and\nbypassing individual intentional psychology in the explanation of\naction (though Durkheim\u2019s views can also be reconstructed along\nless collectivist lines; see Turner 1986). Durkheim\u2019s work is\none of the historical sources for the analysis of collective emotions\n(von Scheve and Salmela 2014).\n\nWeber, by contrast, is famous for assigning the decisive role in the\nexplanation of social facts to the intentional attitudes of\nindividuals. He claims that many social situations are situations of\nstrategic interdependence between individual decisions. In such\nsituations, fully rational agents choose their preferred course of\naction on the basis of what they cognitively expect other agents to\ndo. However, Weber is well aware of the fact that where dependence of\neach participant\u2019s choice on his or her expectation concerning\nthe other\u2019s behavior is out in the open, the situation becomes\nunstable. In addressing this issue, Weber discusses the case in which\npeople act on the assumption of being in agreement with other\nagents, which then enables them to have normative\nexpectations concerning each other\u2019s behavior. This is a\ndecisive step beyond what has later become known as rational choice\ntheory. Such agents do not choose according to what they think to be\nbest given what they think others are likely to do; rather, they rely\non others to do what they ought to do. This need not, Weber\nclaims, be a matter of explicit agreement, but may be grounded in a\nsense of the agent\u2019s shared aims (and thus, we would now say, in\ncollective intentionality). However, such action orientation appears\nas not fully rational in Weber\u2019s conception (Weber 1922).\nWeber\u2019s conception thus foreshadows the neglect of collective\nintentions and actions in later rational choice and game theory. \n\n(Quasi-)Durkheim\u2019s and Weber\u2019s conceptions mark the Scylla\nand the Charybdis of the debate. The Scylla is a straightforward\nanti-reductivism about collective intentionality that comes at the\ncost of a flat-out rejection of individual intentional autonomy. The\nCharybdis is a reductionist attempt that denies collective\nintentionality for rational social agents.\n",
