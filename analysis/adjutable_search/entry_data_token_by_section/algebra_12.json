When those equations are themselves\nidentities for some domain, the equations they are transformed into\nremain identities for that domain. One can therefore start from some\nfinite set of identities and manufacture an unlimited number of new\nidentities from them.\n\nFor example if we start from just the two identities \\((x+y)+z =\nx+(y+z)\\) and \\(x+y = y+x\\), we can obtain the identity \\((w+x)+(y+z)\n= (w+y)+(x+z)\\) via the following series of transformations.\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n(w+x)+(y+z) &= ((w+x)+y)+z \\\\\n &=(w+(x+y))+z \\\\\n &=(w+(y+x))+z \\\\\n &=((w+y)+x)+z \\\\\n &=(w+y)+(x+z) \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThis process of manufacturing new identities from old is called\ndeduction. Any identity that can be generated by deduction\nstarting from a given set \\(A\\) of identities is called a\nconsequence of \\(A\\). The set of all consequences of \\(A\\) is\ncalled the deductive closure of \\(A\\). We refer to \\(A\\) as\nan axiomatization of its deductive closure. A set that is its\nown deductive closure is said to be deductively closed. It is\nstraightforward to show that a set is deductively closed if and\nonly if it is the deductive closure of some set.\n\nAn equational theory is a deductively closed set of\nequations, equivalently the set of all consequences of some set \\(A\\)\nof equations. Every theory always has itself as its own\naxiomatization, but it will usually also have smaller axiomatizations.\nA theory that has a finite axiomatization is said to be finitely\nbased or finitely axiomatizable.\n\nEffectiveness. Finitely based theories can\nbe effectively enumerated. That is, given a finite set \\(A\\) of\nequations, one can write a computer program that prints consequences\nof \\(A\\) for ever in such a way that every consequence of \\(A\\) will\nappear at some finite position in the infinite list of all\nconsequences. The same conclusion obtains when we weaken the\nrequirement that \\(A\\) be finite to merely that it can be effectively\nenumerated. That is, if the axiomatization is effectively enumerable\nso is its deductive closure.\n\n(In reconciling the finite with the infinite, bear in mind that if we\nlist all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, \u2026 in order, we obtain an\ninfinite list every member of which is only finitely far from the\nbeginning, and also has a well-defined predecessor (except for 0) and\nsuccessor. Only if we attempt to pad this list out at the\n\u201cend\u201d with infinite numbers does this principle break\ndown.\n\nOne way to visualize there being an \u201cend\u201d that could have\nmore elements beyond it is to consider the rationals of the form\n\\(1/n\\) for all nonzero integers \\(n\\), in increasing order. This list\nstarts out \\(-1/1, -1/2, -1/3,\\ldots\\) and after listing infinitely\nmany negative rationals of that form, with no greatest such, switches\nover to positive rationals, with no first such, finally ending with\n1/3, 1/2, 1/1. The entire list is discrete in the sense that every\nrational except the endpoints \\(-1/1\\) and 1/1 has a well-defined\npredecessor and successor in this subset of the rationals, unlike the\nsituation for the set of all rationals between \\(-1/1\\) and \\(1/1\\).\nThis would no longer be the case were we to introduce the rational 0\n\u201cin the middle\u201d, which would have neither a predecessor\nnor a successor.)\n\nEquational Logic. Our informal account of\ndeduction can be formalized in terms of five rules for producing new\nidentities from old. In the following, \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) denote\narbitrary terms.\n\n(R1)\nFrom nothing infer \\(t = t\\).\n(R2)\nFrom \\(s = t\\) infer \\(t = s\\).\n(R3)\nFrom \\(s = t\\) and \\(t = u\\) infer \\(s = u\\).\n(R4)\nFrom \\(s_1 = t_1, s_2 = t_2 , \\ldots ,s_n = t_n\\) infer \\(f(s_1,\ns_2 , \\ldots ,s_n)= f(t_1, t_2 , \\ldots ,t_n)\\), where \\(f\\) is an\n\\(n\\)-ary operation.\n(R5)\nFrom \\(s = t\\) infer \\(s' = t'\\) where \\(s'\\) and \\(t'\\) are the\nterms resulting from consistently substituting terms for variables in\n\\(s\\) and \\(t\\) respectively.\n\n\n\u201cConsistently\u201d in this context means that if a term is\nsubstituted for one occurrence of a given variable, the same term must\nbe substituted for all occurrences of that variable in both \\(s\\) and\n\\(t\\). We could not for example appeal solely to R5 to\njustify substituting \\(u+v\\) for \\(x\\) in the left hand side of \\(x+y\n= y+x\\) and \\(v+u\\) for \\(x\\) in the right hand side, though some\nother rule might permit it.\n\nAn equational theory as a set of pairs of terms amounts to a binary\nrelation on the set of all terms. Rules R1\u2013R3\ncorrespond to respectively reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of\nthis binary relation, \\(i.e\\). these three rules assert that an\nequational theory is an equivalence relation. Rule\nR4 expresses the further property that this binary relation\nis a congruence. Rule R5 further asserts that the\nrelation is a substitutive congruence. It can be shown that a binary\nrelation on the set of terms is an equational theory if and only if it\nis a substitutive congruence. These five rules therefore completely\naxiomatize equational logic in the sense that every consequence of a\nset \\(A\\) of equations can be produced from \\(A\\) via finitely many\napplications of these five rules.\n",
