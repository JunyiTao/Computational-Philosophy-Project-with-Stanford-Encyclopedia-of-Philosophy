    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and the Multiverse\n4. Fine-Tuning and the Multiverse\n\nAccording to the multiverse hypothesis, there are multiple universes,\nsome of them radically different from our own. Many of those who\nbelieve that fine-tuning for life requires some theoretical response\nregard it as the main alternative beside the designer hypothesis. The\nidea that underlies it is that, if there is a sufficiently diverse\nmultiverse in which the conditions differ between universes, it is\nonly to be expected that there is at least one where they are right\nfor life. As the strong anthropic principle highlights (see\n Section 3.2),\n the universe in which we, as observers, find ourselves must be one\nwhere the conditions are compatible with the existence of observers.\nThis suggests that, on the assumption that there is a sufficiently\ndiverse multiverse, it is neither surprising that there is at least\none universe that is hospitable to life nor\u2014since we could not\nhave found ourselves in a life-hostile universe\u2014that we find\nourselves in a life-friendly one. Many physicists (e.g., Susskind\n[2005], Greene [2011], Tegmark [2014]) and philosophers (e.g., Leslie\n[1989], Smart [1989], Parfit [1998], Bradley [2009]) regard this line\nof thought as suggesting the inference to a multiverse as a rational\nresponse to the finding that the conditions are right for life in our\nuniverse despite the required fine-tuning.\n",
