    "main_text": "Sister Concepts\n5. Sister Concepts\n\nThe PJP ties itself to two essential concepts: publicity and\nstability. A law that achieves stability and publicity may thereby\ncount as publicly justified. In other cases, theorists see reaching\npublicity and stability as theoretical merits\u2014considerations\nthat favor their approach to public justification over others. If a\nversion of the PJP conflicts with publicity, that could refute the\nspecification. Other factors can count against this specification of\nthe PJP. But publicity and stability are central to public\njustification, so we explore connections.\n",
