    "main_text": "Mental representations and the body || Why body representations?\n3.1 Why body representations?\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century, bodily awareness was typically\nunderstood in terms of a bundle of internal bodily sensations. Bonnier\n(1905) first introduced the term schema to refer to the\nspatial organization of these bodily sensations. But it was only in\nHead and Holmes (1911)\u2019s fundamental paper (discussed in the\nnext section) that one finds the first systematic analysis of the\nway(s) the brain represents the body. They initiated what might be\ncalled the representationalist approach to bodily awareness\n(e.g., O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980; Berm\u00fadez 1998; Vignemont\n2018; Carruthers 2008;\nAlsmith forthcoming; Murillo Lara 2018). Proponents of the\nrepresentationalist approach claim that in order to account for bodily\nawareness one needs to appeal to mental representations of the body.\nAccording to a minimal definition, a body representation is an\ninternal structure that has the function to track the state of the\nbody and encode it, that can misrepresent it and that can be decoupled\nfrom it. It plays the role of model that represents in virtue of its\nresemblance to the structure of the body (Alsmith forthcoming; Gadsby\n& Williams 2018). Now the question is why positing such internal\nmodels.\n\nThe first reason is to account for disturbances in bodily awareness.\nMost of the literature on body representation can be found in patient\nstudies (Head & Holmes 1911; Lhermitte 1942; Cole & Paillard\n1995, Schwoebel & Coslett 2005; Sirigu et al. 1991; Gadsby 2017).\nWith the help of the notion of body representation, and thus of body\nmisrepresentation, one can easily explain how the way the body is\nexperienced can be at odds with the physical reality of the body. On\nthe one hand, amputated patients can still feel the presence of their\nabsent limb because the physically missing limb is still represented.\nOn the other hand, patients with xenomelia can wish their perfectly\nhealthy limbs to be amputated because these limbs are not incorporated\nin their body representation (Hilti & Brugger 2010).\n\nThe second reason focuses on the spatial organization of bodily\nawareness (Bonnier 1905; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1980, 1995; Murillo Lara 2018).\nOver an extended period, all bodily experiences share the same spatial\ncontent of the structural shape of the body. To account for this\ncommonality, O\u2019Shaughnessy posits the existence of a long-term\nbody image that plays a structural role in spatially shaping bodily\nexperiences. One may then propose a hierarchical model of body\nrepresentations on the model of Marr\u2019s theory of vision: the\nprimal sketch, the 2.5D sketch, and the 3D sketch (Marr 1982). At each\nstep, more information is extracted from the original sensory input\nuntil it switches from a viewer-centered perspective to an\nobject-centered perspective. At each stage, the representation of the\nbody gains in complexity and spatial richness (Longo 2017; Haggard et\nal. 2017). The level of the primary somatosensory area (SI)\ncorresponds to the primal body sketch, which takes the shape of a\n\u201chomunculus\u201d (Penfield & Rasmussen, 1950). Although it\ngenerally follows natural anatomical divisions, associating cortical\nareas to specific parts of the body, some are over-represented (e.g.,\nhand), and others under-represented (e.g., torso). Furthermore, the\nhomunculus does not represent anatomical contiguity (e.g., the\nhand-specific area is next to the face-specific area). Consequently,\nthe primal body sketch cannot play the role of supplying information\nabout body metrics and configuration (Medina & Coslett 2016). This\nis done at a higher level of integration (integration among body parts\nand among multiple sensory sources), at which a kind of 3D body sketch\nis generated. Its function is to reliably covariate with the spatial\norganization and dimensions of the body and its segments, in order to\nspatially organize information coming from the body senses. This level\nof body representation is partly independent from online inputs.\n\nThe body model thus seems to play an explanatory role. It remains\nunclear, however, what kind of representation it consists in. On one\ninterpretation, it can be conceived as a kind of scenario in\nPeacocke\u2019s (1992) sense. A scenario is a nonconceptual,\nanalogue, unit-free, spatial representation that uses a set of\nlabelled axes in relation to body parts. Peacocke describes scenarios\nthat depict the subject\u2019s environment, but arguably, one can\nhave a scenario that depicts the subject\u2019s body, with similar\nproperties. On another interpretation, it can be conceived as an\naction-orientated representation (Brewer 1995; Berm\u00fadez 2005):\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic spatial content of normal bodily awareness is given\ndirectly in terms of practical knowledge how to act in connection with\nthe bodily locations involved. (Brewer 1995: 302)\n\n",
