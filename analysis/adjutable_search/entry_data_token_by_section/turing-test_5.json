    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || The Argument from Consciousness\n2.4 The Argument from Consciousness\n\nTuring cites Professor Jefferson\u2019s Lister Oration for\n1949 as a source for the kind of objection that he takes to fall under\nthis label:\n\nNot until a machine can write a sonnet or compose a concerto because\nof thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance fall of symbols,\ncould we agree that machine equals brain\u2014that is, not only write\nit but know that it had written it. No mechanism could feel (and not\nmerely artificially signal, an easy contrivance) pleasure at its\nsuccesses, grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery, be made\nmiserable by its mistakes, be charmed by sex, be angry or depressed\nwhen it cannot get what it wants. (445/6)\n\n\nThere are several different ideas that are being run together here,\nand that it is profitable to disentangle. One idea\u2014the one upon\nwhich Turing first focuses\u2014is the idea that the only way in\nwhich one could be certain that a machine thinks is to be the machine,\nand to feel oneself thinking. A second idea, perhaps, is that the\npresence of mind requires the presence of a certain kind of\nself-consciousness (\u201cnot only write it but know that it had\nwritten it\u201d). A third idea is that it is a mistake to take a\nnarrow view of the mind, i.e. to suppose that there could be a\nbelieving intellect divorced from the kinds of desires and emotions\nthat play such a central role in the generation of human behavior\n(\u201cno mechanism could feel \u2026\u201d).\n\nAgainst the solipsistic line of thought, Turing makes the effective\nreply that he would be satisfied if he could secure agreement on the\nclaim that we might each have just as much reason to suppose that\nmachines think as we have reason to suppose that other people\nthink. (The point isn\u2019t that Turing thinks that solipsism is a\nserious option; rather, the point is that following this line of\nargument isn\u2019t going to lead to the conclusion that there are\nrespects in which digital computers could not be our intellectual\nequals or superiors.)\n\nAgainst the other lines of thought, Turing provides a little\n\u201cviva voce\u201d that is intended to illustrate the\nkind of evidence that he supposes one might have that a machine is\nintelligent. Given the right kinds of responses from the machine, we\nwould naturally interpret its utterances as evidence of\npleasure, grief, warmth, misery, anger, depression, etc.\nPerhaps\u2014though Turing doesn\u2019t say this\u2014the only way\nto make a machine of this kind would be to equip it with sensors,\naffective states, etc., i.e., in effect, to make an artificial\nperson. However, the important point is that if the claims\nabout self-consciousness, desires, emotions, etc. are right, then\nTuring can accept these claims with equanimity: his claim is\nthen that a machine with a digital computing \u201cbrain\u201d can\nhave the full range of mental states that can be enjoyed by adult\nhuman beings.\n",
