That is, while standard semantic\nanalyses of generics aim to treat them in an abstract, formal\nframework, psychologically-oriented theorists have argued instead that\ngeneric generalizations are sensitive to the nature of the property\nbeing generalized. For example, consider the generics\n\u201cmosquitoes carry West Nile virus\u201d, \u201csharks attack\nswimmers\u201d, and \u201cticks carry Lyme disease\u201d. People\nrobustly accept such generics, despite knowing that very few members\nof the kind have the property in question. One possibility is that\nsuch familiar generics are accepted at low prevalence levels because\nthe property in question is dangerous\u2014the sort of property one\nwould do well to avoid (Leslie\u00a02008). This hypothesis is\nsupported by experimental data that finds that people are more likely\nto accept novel generics at low prevalence levels if the\nproperty in question is a dangerous one (Cimpian, Brandone and Gelman\n2010). As noted above, generics like \u201cticks carry Lyme\ndisease\u201d have proved difficult for the formal semantic\napproaches to accommodate. If generics are indeed sensitive to factors\nsuch as whether the property is question is dangerous or not, this\ndifficulty would be expected\u2014since formal semantic frameworks do\nnot normally take into account such features of the property, but\nrather aim to abstract away from such content-based\nconsiderations.\n\nIf generic generalizations are indeed sensitive to the nature of the\nproperty being generalized, might that account for other\n\u201ctroublesome\u201d generics? In addition to being sensitive to\nwhether the property is dangerous or not, it has been proposed that\ngenerics may also be sensitive to whether the property in question is\ncharacteristic of the kind (Cimpian, Brandone et al. 2010; Cimpian,\nGelman et al. 2010; Gelman and Bloom 2007; Leslie 2007, 2008; Prasada\nand Dillingham 2006, 2009). Examples of characteristic properties of\nkinds would include salient, distinctive physical features (e.g.,\n\u201clions have manes\u201d), methods of reproduction for animal\nkinds (e.g., \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d), and functions for artifact\nkinds (e.g., \u201cOrange-Crusher-2000s crush oranges\u201d). If a\ngeneric attributes a characteristic property to the kind, then the\ngeneric may be accepted even if few members of the kind have the\nproperty in question.\n\nIf generics are indeed sensitive to such factors, it may be possible\nto explain why some generics are accepted even though the property is\nnot prevalent among members of the kind. What, though, of generics\nsuch as \u201cbooks are paperbacks\u201d or \u201cschool teachers\nare female\u201d? People tend to reject such generics, despite\njudging that the property in question is highly prevalent (Prasada et\nal. 2013). One proposal is that generics may be sensitive to the\nnature of the exceptions to the generic claim (Leslie 2007,\n2008). That is, amongst the members of the kind that fail to have the\npredicated property, it may matter how they fail to have the\nproperty\u2014in particular whether they simply lack the property, or\nwhether they have an equally salient, concrete, positive property\ninstead. The non-infected ticks simply do not carry Lyme\ndisease\u2014they do not have an alternative property instead.\nHowever, the books that are not paperbacks are instead hardcover.\nSimilarly, people who are not right-handed are instead\nleft-handed; elementary school teachers who are not female\nare male. Intuitively, one might feel as though one would be\n\u201coverlooking\u201d these hardcover books, these left-handed\nindividuals, and these male school teachers if one accepted the\ngenerics in question. Thus, it is possible that generics may be\nsensitive to the nature of the exceptions to the generalization.\nHowever, more empirical investigation is needed on this point.\n",
