    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Utilitarianism || Conceptions of Duty\n2.5 Conceptions of Duty\n\nAs Mill\u2019s Proportionality Doctrine makes clear, he endorses the\nutilitarian idea that duty or right action is to be defined in terms\nof the promotion of happiness. But exactly how Mill thinks duty is\nrelated to happiness is not entirely clear. To understand the\ndifferent strands in his conception of utilitarianism, we need to\ndistinguish between direct and indirect utilitarianism.\n\nDirect Utilitarianism: Any object of moral assessment\n(e.g., action, motive, policy, or institution) should be assessed by\nand in proportion to the value of its consequences for the general\nhappiness.\nIndirect Utilitarianism: Any object of moral assessment\nshould be assessed, not by the value of its consequences for the\ngeneral happiness, but by its conformity to something else (e.g.,\nnorms or motives) that has (have) good or optimal acceptance\nvalue.\n\n\nSo formulated, direct and indirect utilitarianism are general theories\nthat apply to any object of moral assessment. But our focus here is on\nright action or duty. Act utilitarianism is the most familiar form of\ndirect utilitarianism applied to action, whereas the most common\nindirect utilitarian theory of duty is rule utilitarianism.\n\nAct Utilitarianism: An act is right insofar as its\nconsequences for the general happiness are at least as good as any\nalternative available to the agent.\nRule Utilitarianism: An act is right insofar as it\nconforms to a rule whose acceptance value for the general happiness is\nat least as great as any alternative rule available to the agent.\n\n\nThis conception of act utilitarianism is both maximizing,\nbecause it identifies the right action with the best available action,\nand scalar, because it recognizes that rightness can come in\ndegrees, depending on the action\u2019s proximity to the best\n(contrast Norcross 2008). The right act is the optimal act, but some\nsuboptimal acts can be more right and less wrong than others.\nSimilarly, this conception of rule utilitarianism assesses rules in\nboth maximizing and scalar fashion.\n",
