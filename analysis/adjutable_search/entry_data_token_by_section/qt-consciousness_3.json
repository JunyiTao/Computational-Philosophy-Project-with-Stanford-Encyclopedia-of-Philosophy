    "main_text": "Quantum Brain || Neurophysiological Levels of Description\n3.1 Neurophysiological Levels of Description\n\nA mental system can be in many different conscious, intentional,\nphenomenal mental states. In a hypothetical state space, a sequence of\nsuch states forms a trajectory representing what is often called the\nstream of consciousness. Since different subsets of the state space\nare typically associated with different stability properties, a mental\nstate can be assumed to be more or less stable, depending on its\nposition in the state space. Stable states are distinguished by a\nresidence time at that position longer than that of metastable or\nunstable states. If a mental state is stable with respect to\nperturbations, it \u201cactivates\u201d a mental representation\nencoding a content that is consciously perceived.\nNeural Assemblies\n\nMoving from this purely psychological, or cognitive, description to\nits neurophysiological counterpart leads us to the question: What is\nthe neural correlate of a mental representation? According to standard\naccounts (cf. No\u00eb and Thompson (2004) for discussion), mental\nrepresentations are correlated with the activity of neuronal\nassemblies, i.e., ensembles of several thousands of coupled neurons.\nThe neural correlate of a mental representation can be characterized\nby the fact that the connectivities, or couplings, among those neurons\nform an assembly confined with respect to its environment, to which\nconnectivities are weaker than within the assembly. The neural\ncorrelate of a mental representation is activated if the neurons\nforming the assembly operate more actively, e.g., produce higher\nfiring rates, than in their default mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Balance between inhibitory and\nexcitatory connections among neurons.\n\n\nIn order to achieve a stable operation of an activated neuronal\nassembly, there must be a subtle balance between inhibitory and\nexcitatory connections among neurons (cf. Figure 1). If the transfer\nfunction of individual neurons is strictly monotonic, i.e., increasing\ninput leads to increasing output, assemblies are difficult to\nstabilize. For this reason, results establishing a non-monotonic\ntransfer function with a maximal output at intermediate input are of\nhigh significance for the modeling of neuronal assemblies (Kuhn et\nal. 2004). For instance, network models using lattices of coupled\nmaps with quadratic maximum (Kaneko and Tsuda 2000) are paradigmatic\nexamples of such behavior. These and other familiar models of neuronal\nassemblies (for an overview see Anderson and Rosenfeld 1988) are\nmostly formulated in a way not invoking well-defined elements\nof quantum theory. An explicit exception is the approach by Umezawa,\nVitiello and others (see\n Section 3.3).\n Single Neurons and Synapses\n\nThe fact that neuronal assemblies are mostly described in terms of\nclassical behavior does not rule out that classically undescribable\nquantum effects may be significant if one focuses on individual\nconstituents of assemblies, i.e., single neurons or interfaces between\nthem. These interfaces, through which the signals between neurons\npropagate, are called synapses. There are electrical and chemical\nsynapses, depending on whether they transmit a signal electrically or\nchemically.\n\nAt electrical synapses, the current generated by the action potential\nat the presynaptic neuron flows directly into the postsynaptic cell,\nwhich is physically connected to the presynaptic terminal by a\nso-called gap junction. At chemical synapses, there is a cleft between\npre- and postsynaptic cell. In order to propagate a signal, a chemical\ntransmitter (glutamate) is released at the presynaptic terminal. This\nrelease process is called exocytosis. The transmitter diffuses across\nthe synaptic cleft and binds to receptors at the postsynaptic\nmembrane, thus opening an ion channel (Kandel et al. 2000,\npart III; see Fig. 2). Chemical transmission is slower than electric\ntransmission.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Release of neurotransmitters\nat the synaptic cleft (exocytosis).\n\n\nA model developed by Beck and Eccles applies concrete quantum\nmechanical features to describe details of the process of exocytosis.\nTheir model proposes that quantum processes are relevant for\nexocytosis and, moreover, are tightly related to states of\nconsciousness. This will be discussed in more detail in\n Section 3.4.\n\nAt this point, another approach developed by Flohr (2000) should be\nmentioned, for which chemical synapses with a specific type of\nreceptors, so-called NMDA\n receptors,[6]\n are of paramount significance. Briefly, Flohr observes that the\nspecific plasticity of NMDA receptors is a necessary condition for the\nformation of extended stable neuronal assemblies correlated to\n(higher-order) mental representations which he identifies with\nconscious states. Moreover, he indicates a number of mechanisms caused\nby anaesthetic agents, which block NMDA receptors and consequently\nlead to a loss of consciousness. Flohr\u2019s approach is\nphysicalistic and reductive, and it is entirely independent of any\nspecific quantum ideas.\n Microtubuli\n\nThe lowest neurophysiological level, at which quantum processes have\nbeen proposed as a correlate to consciousness, is the level at which\nthe interior of single neurons is considered: their cytoskeleton. It\nconsists of protein networks essentially made up of two kinds of\nstructures, neurofilaments and microtubuli (Fig. 3, left), which are\nessential for various transport processes within neurons (as well as\nother cells). Microtubuli are long polymers usually constructed of 13\nlongitudinal \u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin dimers arranged in a tubular\narray with an outside diameter of about 25 nm (Fig. 3, right). For\nmore details see Kandel et al. (2000), Chap. II.4.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. (left) microtubuli and\nneurofilaments, the width of the figure corresponds to approximately\n700nm; (right) tubulin dimers, consisting of \u03b1- and\n\u03b2-monomers, constituting a microtubule.\n\n\nThe tubulins in microtubuli are the substrate which, in\nHameroff\u2019s proposal, is used to embed Penrose\u2019s\ntheoretical framework neurophysiologically. As will be discussed in\nmore detail in\n Section 3.5,\n tubulin states are assumed to depend on quantum events, so that\nquantum coherence among different tubulins is possible. Further, a\ncrucial thesis in the scenario of Penrose and Hameroff is that the\n(gravitation-induced) collapse of such coherent tubulin states\ncorresponds to elementary acts of consciousness.\n",
