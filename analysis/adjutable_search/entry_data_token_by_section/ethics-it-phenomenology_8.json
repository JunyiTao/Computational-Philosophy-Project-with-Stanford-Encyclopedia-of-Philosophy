    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches to Technology || A (Post) Phenomenology of the Human/Technology Relationship\n2.4 A (Post) Phenomenology of the Human/Technology Relationship\n\nPhenomenology does not only function as an approach to reveal and\ncritique our relationship with technology, as suggested by Heidegger,\nDreyfus and Borgmann. Don Ihde (1990, 1995, 2002, 2010) has used the\nresources of phenomenology to give a rich and subtle account of the\nvariety and complexity of our relationship with technology\u2014what\nhe refers to as a postphenomenology of technology (Ihde 2009, 2010;\nSelinger 2006). With postphenomenology Ihde wants to move away from\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 (and often dystopian) grand narratives of\nthe technological to a more grounded empirical analysis of the\nhuman/technology relationship. This move to the empirical is often\ndescribed as the \u2018empirical turn\u2019 in the philosophy of\ntechnology (Achterhuis 2001). Postphenomenology is a relational\nontology, which proposes that the subject/object (or human/technology)\nrelation is not just interactional but also co-constitutive\n(Rosenberger and Verbeek 2015). Moreover, this co-constitutive\nrelation is fundamentally mediated. There are no direct relations\nbetween subject and object\u2014only \u2018indirect\u2019 ones in\nwhich technologies often function as mediators, not to connect but to\nco-constitute. As such, the human-world relation is typically a\nhuman-technology-world relation. In this relation, there are no\npre-given subjects or pre-given objects (which then connect through\nsome form of mediators). Rather mediation is the original source from\nwhich a specific subjectivity and objectivity emerges, or become\nenacted, as part of specific situated doings. Ihde defines this\noriginally mediated nature of existence as embodiment (Ihde 2011).\nPostphenomenology aims to describe the varieties of\nsubjectivities/objectivities that emerge through different\nembodiments. What sort of subjects do we become (and what does the\nworld become) through the embodiments of the microscope, the\ntelescope, self-driving cars, the computer screen, and so forth?\n\nIn thinking about these embodied human/technology relationships Ihde\ncharacterizes four different I-technology-world relationships. The\nfirst type of relationship he calls embodiment relations. In\nthis case technology is taken as the very medium of subjective\nperceptual experience of the world, thus transforming the\nsubject\u2019s perceptual and bodily sense. In wearing my eyeglasses\nI do not only see through them; they also become \u2018seen\nthrough.\u2019 In functioning as that which they are, they already\nwithdraw into my own bodily sense as being a part of the ordinary way\nI experience my surrounding. He denotes this relationship as having\nthe form [I-glasses]-world. He further argues that this relationship\nhas a necessary \u2018magnification/reduction structure\u2019\nassociated with it. Embodiment relations simultaneously magnify and\namplify or reduce and place aside (screen out) what is (and is not)\nexperienced through them. The moon through the telescope is different\nfrom the moon in the night sky perceived by the naked eye. The person\nat the other end of the online chat is made present to me across a\ngreat distance at the expense of being reduced to text on the\nscreen.\n\nThe second type of human/technology relation is what he calls\nhermeneutic. In this type of relation the technology\nfunctions as an immediate referent to something beyond itself.\nAlthough I might fix my focus on the text or the map, what I actually\nsee (encounter) is not the map itself but rather immediately and\nsimultaneously the world it already refers to, the landscape already\nsuggested in the symbols. In this case the transparency of the\ntechnology is hermeneutic rather than perceptual. As I become skilled\nat reading maps they withdraw to become for me immediately and already\nthe world itself. He denotes this relationship as having the form\nI-[map-world].\n\nThe third type of human/technology relations Ihde calls\n\u2018alterity\u2019 relations. In these relations\ntechnology is experienced as a being that is otherwise, different from\nme, technology-as-other. Examples include things such as religious\nicons and intelligent robots (the\n Sony Dog AIBO\n for example). In my interaction with these technologies they seem to\nexhibit a \u2018world of their own.\u2019 As I engage them they tend\nto disengage me from the world of everyday life and point to the\npossibility of other worlds, hence their pervasiveness in activities\nsuch as play, art and sport. He denotes these as having the form\nI-technology-[world], indicating that the world withdraws into the\nbackground and technology emerges as a focal entity with which I\nmomentarily engage\u2014as I play with my robot dog for example.\n\nIhde also recognizes a fourth type of human/technology relation in\nwhich technology is not directly implicated in a conscious process of\nengagement on the part of the human actor. Ihde refers to these as\nbackground relations. Examples include automatic central\nheating systems, traffic control systems, and so forth. These systems\nare \u2018black-boxed\u2019 in such a way that we do not attend to\nthem yet we draw on them for our ongoing everyday existence. They\nwithdraw as ongoing background conditions. Although he does not\ndesignate it as such one might formalize these relations in the form:\nI-[technology]-world. These invisible background technologies can be\npowerful in configuring our world in particular ways yet escape our\nscrutiny.\n\nIhde\u2019s phenomenological description of the human/technology\nrelation provides a meaningful taxonomy or framework to give an\naccount of many everyday technology relations in a manner that can\nfacilitate our considerations of the social and ethical implications\nof information technology. For example, the withdrawal of technology,\ninto my body, into my perception and into the background has important\npolitical and ethical implications for its design and implementation.\nEspecially if one considers that every disclosure of the world\n\u2018through\u2019 technology is also immediately a concealment of\nother possible disclosive relations. The car discloses\npossibilities\u2014for getting to places quickly\u2014but also\nconceals, in its withdrawal, the resources (roads, fuel, clean air,\netc.) necessary for it to be what it is\u2014they act as devices in\nBorgmann\u2019s terminology. Indeed we often lose sight of the\nreduction/magnification structure as we simply use these technologies.\nAs these technologies become more and more pervasive\u2014almost a\nnecessary condition of everyday life\u2014it becomes more and more\ndifficult to see that which has become concealed in their withdrawal.\nWith Ihde\u2019s typology of I-technology-world relations we might be\nable to bring what has become concealed back to the foreground for our\ncritical attention and ethical reflection. Let us now consider how\nthese different ways of approaching the information technology/society\nrelationship might circumscribe our thinking about the social and\nethical implications of information technology.\n",
