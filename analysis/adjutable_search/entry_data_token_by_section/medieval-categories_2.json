    "main_text": "Early Middle Ages (ca. 500\u20131150)\n3. Early Middle Ages (ca. 500\u20131150)\n\n\nLong before the Middle Ages, a well-defined tradition of writing\ncommentaries on philosophical works had been established. It is\nperhaps natural, then, that the most common way of engaging philosophy\nthroughout the Middle Ages consisted in writing commentaries on what\nwere considered authoritative philosophical texts, and particularly\nworks by Aristotle. So popular was commentary writing that thousands\nof Medieval Latin commentaries on Aristotle's writings are still\nextant, of which nearly two hundred concern the Categories\n(Lohr 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973). These commentaries were not\nalways intended simply to explain texts; often, they became the means\nof developing the thoughts of the commentators on various\nphilosophical topics. Moreover, commentators did not comment on\nAristotle's works in isolation, but also consulted other commentaries\non the same texts. In this way, they engaged and often challenged\nother interpretations, and developed their own insights.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the sixth century, we find several late\nNeoplatonic philosophers who continue the ancient tradition of\ncommentary writing. They include Boethius, Philoponus, Elias, David,\npseudo-Elias, Stephanus, and Simplicius. Two of these in particular\ndeserve mention. Simplicius (490\u2013560) is important because his\nCommentary was translated into Latin by William of Moerbeke in 1266\nand was subsequently read by Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Ockham, among\nothers, though apparently not by Albertus Magnus. In addition,\nSimplicius attempted to prove that there are ten and only ten\ncategories, something that became the subject of dispute in the later\nMiddle Ages.\n\n\nBoethius (ca. 480\u2013524/5) is important because he sought to\npreserve Greek philosophy by translating all of the works of Plato and\nAristotle into Latin. Unfortunately, his untimely death prevented him\nfrom accomplishing his ambitious goal, though he did succeed in\ntranslating Aristotle's Categories, On Interpretation, Prior\nAnalytics, and Porphyry's Isagoge. Moreover, Boethius\nhad hoped to write two commentaries on many of Aristotle's works: an\nintroductory commentary for students of philosophy and an advanced\ncommentary for philosophers. But again, his early death prevented him\nfrom producing second commentaries. Like other Neoplatonic\ncommentaries, Boethius' work draws heavily from Porphyry and\nperpetuates the view of the categories which became the canonical\ninterpretation of Aristotle's text, i.e., that it is a work about\nvocal signs that signify things (Boethius 1847, 160 a-b).\n\n\nDue to the closure of the Academy in 529 and the dominance of the\nLatin language in the West to the virtual exclusion of Greek, little\nof the ancient commentary tradition exerted any influence on the Latin\nMiddle Ages. Thus, in spite of the many commentaries produced in the\nancient world, the main texts available to authors dealing with\ncategories after the sixth century were Boethius' translation of and\nCommentary on Aristotle's Categories, the Categoriae\ndecem (a Themistian paraphrase of Aristotle's Categories\ntraditionally attributed to St. Augustine), and a composite\ntranslation which included the lemmata of Boethius' Commentary and\nsome glosses. A few other works refer to categories, such as\nPorphyry's Isagoge, translated and commented on twice by\nBoethius, and Boethius' two Commentaries on On Interpretation\nand his treatise On the Trinity. However, the\ngrowing interest in logic that began in the ninth century and then was\nrevived in the eleventh century made Boethius' translation and\nCommentary on the Categories the center of attention on this\ntopic.\nFrom the sixth to the ninth century, most commentaries on the\nCategories were written in Syriac.  These include commentaries by Paul\nthe Persian (fl. 550), Sergius of Re\u0161\u2018aina (d. 536), Aba\nof Kashkar (fl. c. 600), Silvanus of Qardu (early seventh century),\nAthanasius of Balad (d. 687), Jacob of Edessa (d. 708), George of the\nArabs (d. 724), Theodore bar Koni (late eighth century), David bar\nPaul (fl. 785), Mo\u0161\u0113 bar K\u0113ph\u0101 (d. 903), and by\nHunayn ibn Ish\u0101q.  The last Commentary, in turn, appears to be\nthe source for the Arabic tradition (see King 2011).\n\n\nBeginning in the tenth century, Islamic philosophers\nsuch as Alfarabi (ca. 870\u2013950), Avicenna (980\u20131037), and\nAverroes (ca.  1126\u201398), produced commentaries, but their impact\nin the West was felt only after the period of translations from Arabic\ninto Latin which began in Spain around the middle of the twelfth\ncentury. This process introduced many technical terms that came to\nhave considerable impact on philosophical and theological\ndiscussions. Also worth mentioning are the Liber sex\nprincipiorum, an anonymous work traditionally ascribed to Gilbert\nof Poitiers (1085/90\u20131154) that sought to expand Aristotle's\nbrief comments on the last six categories, and Peter Abelard\n(1079\u20131142), who discussed categories in his work (see Marenbon\n1997).\n\n\nAlthough commentaries on Aristotle's Categories written\nbefore 1200 tend to be expository, still they raise important\nphilosophical questions, such as whether the categories time\nand place are synonymous with when and\nwhere, or whether action and passion are\nreducible to motion. Even more important is the lively debate\nbetween realists and nominalists concerning whether categories are\nwords, concepts, or things (for Abelard's influence, see Marenbon\n1997, 108). The position they take on it determines the discipline in\nwhich they think the categories are studied and affect the degree of\nisomorphism they believe holds between language (words), thought\n(concepts), and reality (things). If Aristotle's Categories\nis a book about words, then categories are studied in grammar; if it\nis about concepts, they are studied in logic; and if it is about\nextra-mental things, they are studied in metaphysics.\n\n\nBy the early thirteenth century, an inclusive view, according to which\nAristotle's Categories is about words, concepts, and things,\nbecame standard. This view, shared by almost everyone up to Ockham\n(Pini, 2003, 11\u201318), had two important results. First, it lent\nsupport to the belief that categories are legitimately studied in\nthree disciplines: grammar, logic, and metaphysics, but especially in\nlogic and metaphysics. Second, it suggested a certain isomorphism\nbetween language (words), thought (concepts), and reality\n(things). The second point was supported by at least two passages in\nAristotle's writings. In On the Soul, Aristotle claims that\n\u201cin the case of objects which involve no matter\u2026\nspeculative knowledge and its object are identical\u201d (430a\n3\u20134). And in the text of On Interpretation cited\nearlier (16a 4\u20138) a similar point is made.  Taken together,\nthese texts suggest that in some ways language (words), thought\n(concepts), and reality (things) are like each other in important\nways, a fact that explains their relations.\n",
