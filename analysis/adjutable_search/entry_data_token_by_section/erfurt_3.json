    "main_text": "Modism\n4. Influence\n\nThomas of Erfurt\u2019s De modis significandi has enjoyed more\nattention than it might otherwise have received thanks to its early\nmisidentification as a work of Duns\n Scotus.[18]\n As a result, it was printed along with authentic works on logic in\nvolume 1 of Luke Wadding\u2019s seventeenth-century edition of the\nOpera Omnia of Duns Scotus (Lyons 1639), and again in the\nnineteenth-century reprint of Wadding by Juan-Luis Viv\u00e8s (Paris\n 1891).[19]\n Until recently, the Wadding-Viv\u00e8s edition was the definitive\nsource for the works of Scotus, so anyone consulting it would have\nassociated De modis significandi with\n him.[20]\n Complicating the story somewhat is the fact that Scotus was\ninfluenced by Modism early in his career, though this was probably due\nto his exposure to Modist authors such as Simon of Faversham and\nAndrew of\n Cornwall.[21]\n It is unlikely that he was influenced by Thomas of Erfurt, because\nDe modis significandi did not circulate widely until after\nScotus\u2019s death.\n\nThomas of Erfurt had a famous contemporary, Meister Eckhart (c.\n1260\u20131328), the German Dominican philosopher and mystical\ntheologian. Meister Eckhart was not only present in Erfurt at roughly\nthe same time as Thomas, but also lived only a few streets away. It\nseems incredible that they could not have known each other personally\nand academically, though there is no explicit evidence that they did.\nDespite this, there is indirect evidence that Meister Eckhart was\ninfluenced by Thomas in his grammatical approach to interpreting\nscripture. Their intellectual relationship is the subject of a recent\nvolume of\n essays.[22]\n\n\nOne of the many later figures to have unwittingly admired Thomas was\nthe American philosopher, Charles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914),\nwho regarded Duns Scotus as a fellow traveler in metaphysics and whose\nown semiotic theory resembles the Modist program in certain\n respects.[23]\n Peirce quotes verbatim the first six chapters of De modis\nsignificandis in an 1869 lecture comparing (what he took to be)\nthe views of Duns Scotus and William of Ockham on names and\nsignification. But the lecture is introductory in character, leaving\nit uncertain whether Peirce fully appreciated what was at stake in\nModistic grammar, rather than viewing it, say, as some sort of\nlinguistic addendum to Scotus\u2019s\n metaphysics.[24]\n\nAnother figure so influenced was Martin Heidegger, whose\nHabilitationsschrift was published in 1916 under the title,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus. This\nbook is only beginning to be studied by Heidegger scholars, which is a\npity because it is really about Heidegger\u2019s own project of advancing\nthe Husserlian notion of a priori grammar. A work of\nhistorical scholarship it is not. In what now seems a classic\nunderstatement, the historian of medieval philosophy Martin Grabmann\nwrote of this book in 1926, \u201cMartin Heidegger has demonstrated\nthe continuity of the Grammatica speculativa hitherto\nattributed to Duns Scotus with the terminology and overall\nintellectual outlook of Husserl, so that the structure and\ndistinctiveness of the medieval original is somewhat\n obscured\u201d.[25]\n In his defense, Heidegger never pretends to be doing history of\nphilosophy in Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns\nScotus. On the contrary, he states at the beginning of Part II\nthat he is mostly interested in exploring the implications of De\nmodis significandi for the broader theory of meaning, and that he\nis following scholarly consensus in attributing it to Duns\n Scotus.[26]\n\nIn 1922, however, Grabmann conclusively demonstrated that it was\nThomas of Erfurt who wrote De modis significandi, not Duns\n Scotus.[27]\n So the claim that Heidegger wrote his Habilitationsschrift\non Duns Scotus is only partly true. The first half, die\nKategorienlehre, is correctly addressed to Scotus\u2019s theory of the\ncategories as developed in his authentic commentaries on Porphyry\u2019s\nIsagoge, and Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De\nsophisticis elenchis. But the second half, die\nBedeutungslehre, is based almost entirely on Thomas of\n Erfurt.[28]\n\nFor more recent influence, we need look no further than Jacques\nDerrida, who mentions Thomas of Erfurt (this time dressed as himself)\nin connection with the old Peircean idea that logic is a branch of\nsemiotics: \u201cAs in Husserl (but the analogy, although it is most\nthought-provoking, would stop there and one must apply it carefully),\nthe lowest level, the foundation of the possibility of logic (or\nsemiotics) corresponds to the project of the Grammatica\nspeculativa of Thomas d\u2019Erfurt, falsely attributed to Duns\n Scotus\u201d (1976: 48).\n What impresses Derrida is not so much the reduction of logic to\ngrammar as the deconstructive potential of Husserl\u2019s phenomenology of\nsigns. The idea of deconstructing the science of language would have\nstruck Thomas as absurd, of course, though he probably would have felt\nsome affinity with the highly variegated notion of the sign in modern\nsemiotics. \n",
