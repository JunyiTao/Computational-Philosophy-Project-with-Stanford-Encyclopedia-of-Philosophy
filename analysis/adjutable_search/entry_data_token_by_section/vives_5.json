    "main_text": "Psychology\n6. Influence\n\nVives\u2019 works, which went through hundreds of editions and were\ntranslated into several vernacular languages, continued to be widely\nread and extremely influential during the century after their\npublication. His critical attitude toward the Aristotelian orthodoxy\nof his day left a mark on several authors. Mario Nizolio\n(1488\u20131567) cites Vives numerous times in De veris\nprincipiis et vera ratione philosophandi contra pseudophilosophos\n(On the True Principles and True Method of Philosophizing against\nthe Pseudo-Philosophers, 1553), an attack on Aristotelian\ndialectic and metaphysics, which G. W. Leibniz (1646\u20131716)\nconsidered to be worth editing more than a hundred years later. In\nQuod nihil scitur (That Nothing is Known, 1581), one\nof the best systematic expositions of philosophical skepticism\nproduced during the sixteenth century, the Portuguese philosopher and\nmedical writer Francisco Sanches displays a familiarity with De\ndisciplinis, and there are indications that he might also have\nbeen acquainted with In pseudodialecticos. In\nExercitationes paradoxicae adversus Aristoteleos\n(Paradoxical Exercises against the Aristotelians, 1624), a\nskeptical attack on Aristotelianism, Pierre Gassendi says that reading\nVives gave him courage and helped him to free himself from the\ndogmatism of Peripatetic philosophy.\n\nPsychology was another area in which Vives enjoyed considerable\nsuccess. Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560) recommended De anima\net vita in the prefatory letter to his Commentarius de\nanima (Commentary on the Soul, 1540). Vives\u2019\ninfluence on the naturalistic pedagogy of the Spaniard Juan Huarte de\nSan Juan (c.1529\u20131588), in his celebrated El examen de\ningenios para las ciencias (The Examination of Men\u2019s\nWits, 1575), is undeniable. In his discussion of the passions of\nthe soul, the Jesuit Francisco Su\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617) counted\nVives among his authorities, pointing out that the study of the\nemotions belongs to natural philosophy and medicine as well as to\nmoral philosophy. Vives\u2019 treatise was also an important source\nof inspiration for Robert Burton (1577\u20131640), who, in The\nAnatomy of Melancholy (1621), repeatedly quotes from De anima\net vita. The reference to Vives by Ren\u00e9 Descartes\n(1596\u20131650) in Les Passions de l\u2019\u00e2me (1649)\nsuggests that he had read the book.\n\nAlthough Vives is rarely mentioned in the scholarly literature on the\nScottish philosophy of \u201cCommon Sense,\u201d the impact of his\nthought on leading exponents of the school was significant. William\nHamilton (1788\u20131856) praised Vives\u2019 insights on memory and\nthe laws of association. In his \u201cContributions Towards a History\nof the Doctrine of Mental Suggestion or Association\u201d, he quotes\nextensive portions of Vives\u2019 account of memory and maintains\nthat the observations of \u201cthe Spanish Aristotelian\u201d\ncomprise \u201cnearly all of principal moment that has been said upon\nthis subject, either before or since\u201d. Moreover, Vives\u2019\nDialectices libri quatuor (1550) was one of the primary\nsources of Thomas Reid (1710\u20131796) in his \u201cA Brief Account\nof Aristotle\u2019s Logic\u201d (1774).\n\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century and the fist decades\nof the twentieth, Vives was read and studied by philosophers such as\nErnest Renan (1823\u20131892), Friedrich Albert Lange\n(1828\u20131875), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911), Pierre Duhem\n(1861\u20131916), Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), and Jos\u00e9\nOrtega y Gasset (1883\u20131955). Lange regards him as one of the\nmost important reformers of philosophy of his time and a precursor of\nboth Bacon and Descartes. According to Ortega y Gasset, Vives\u2019\nmethod, firmly based on experience, and his emphasis on the need to\nfound a new culture grounded, not in barren speculation, but in the\nusefulness of knowledge, anticipate some elements of the modern\nZeitgeist.\n",
