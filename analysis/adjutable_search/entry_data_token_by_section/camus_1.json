    "main_text": "Nuptials and Camus\u2019s Starting Point\n2. Nuptials and Camus\u2019s Starting Point\n\nCamus\u2019s graduate thesis at the University of Algiers\nsympathetically explored the relationship between Greek philosophy and\nChristianity, specifically the relationship of Plotinus to Augustine\n(Camus 1992). Nevertheless, his philosophy explicitly rejects religion\nas one of its foundations. Not always taking an openly hostile posture\ntowards religious belief\u2014though he certainly does in the novels\nThe Stranger and The Plague\u2014Camus centers his\nwork on choosing to live without God. Another way to understand\nCamus\u2019s philosophy is that it is an effort to explore the issues\nand pitfalls of a post-religious world.\n\nCamus\u2019s earliest published writing containing philosophical\nthinking, Nuptials, appeared in Algeria in 1938, and remain\nthe basis of his later work. These lyrical essays and sketches\ndescribe a consciousness reveling in the world, a body delighting in\nnature, and the individual\u2019s immersion in sheer physicality. Yet\nthese experiences are presented as the solution to a philosophical\nproblem, namely finding the meaning of life in the face of death. They\nappear alongside, and reveal themselves to be rooted in, his first\nextended meditation on ultimate questions.\n\nIn these essays, Camus sets two attitudes in opposition. The first is\nwhat he regards as religion-based fears. He cites religious warnings\nabout pride, concern for one\u2019s immortal soul, hope for an\nafterlife, resignation about the present and preoccupation with God.\nAgainst this conventional Christian perspective Camus asserts what he\nregards as self-evident facts: that we must die and there is nothing\nbeyond this life. Without mentioning it, Camus draws a conclusion from\nthese facts, namely that the soul is not immortal. Here, as elsewhere\nin his philosophical writing, he commends to his readers to face a\ndiscomforting reality squarely and without flinching, but he does not\nfeel compelled to present reasons or evidence. If not with religion,\nwhere then does wisdom lie? His answer is: with the \u201cconscious\ncertainty of a death without hope\u201d and in refusing to hide from\nthe fact that we are going to die. For Camus \u201cthere is no\nsuperhuman happiness, no eternity outside of the curve of the\ndays\u2026. I can see no point in the happiness of angels\u201d\n(N, 90). There is nothing but this world,\nthis life, the immediacy of the present.\n\nCamus is sometimes mistakenly called a \u201cpagan\u201d because he\nrejects Christianity as based on a hope for a life beyond this life.\nHope is the error Camus wishes to avoid. Rejecting \u201cthe\ndelusions of hope\u201d (N, 74), Nuptials contains\nan evocation of an alternative. Camus relies for this line of thought\non Nietzsche\u2019s discussion of Pandora\u2019s Box in Human,\nAll Too Human: all the evils of humankind, including plagues and\ndisease, have been let loose on the world by Zeus, but the remaining\nevil, hope, is kept hidden away in the box and treasured. But why, we\nmay ask, is hope an evil? Nietzsche explains that humans have come to\nsee hope as their greatest good, while Zeus, knowing better, has meant\nit as the greatest source of trouble. It is, after all, the reason why\nhumans let themselves be tormented\u2014because they anticipate an\nultimate reward (Nietzsche 1878/1996, 58). For Camus, following this\nreading of Nietzsche closely, the conventional solution is in fact the\nproblem: hope is disastrous for humans inasmuch as it leads them to\nminimize the value of this life except as preparation for a life\nbeyond.\n\nIf religious hope is based on the mistaken belief that death, in the\nsense of utter and total extinction body and soul, is not inevitable,\nit leads us down a blind alley. Worse, because it teaches us to look\naway from life toward something to come afterwards, such religious\nhope kills a part of us, for example, the realistic attitude we need\nto confront the vicissitudes of life. But what then is the appropriate\npath? The young Camus is neither a skeptic nor a relativist here. His\ndiscussion rests on the self-evidence of sensuous experience. He\nadvocates precisely what he takes Christianity to abjure: living a\nlife of the senses, intensely, here and now, in the present. This\nentails, first, abandoning all hope for an afterlife, indeed rejecting\nthinking about it. \u201cI do not want to believe that death is the\ngateway to another life. For me it is a closed door\u201d\n(N, 76).\n\nWe might think that facing our total annihilation would be bitter, but\nfor Camus this leads us in a positive direction: \u201cBetween this\nsky and the faces turned toward it there is nothing on which to hang a\nmythology, a literature, an ethic, or a religion\u2014only stones,\nflesh, stars, and those truths the hand can touch\u201d (N,\n90). This insight entails obstinately refusing \u201call the\n\u2018later on\u2019s of this world,\u201d in order to lay claim to\n\u201cmy present wealth\u201d (N, 103), namely the intense\nhere-and-now life of the senses. The \u201cwealth\u201d is precisely\nwhat hope cheats us out of by teaching us to look away from it and\ntowards an afterlife. Only by yielding to the fact that our\n\u201clonging to endure\u201d will be frustrated and accepting our\n\u201cawareness of death\u201d are we able to open ourselves to the\nriches of life, which are physical above all.\n\nCamus puts both sides of his argument into a single statement:\n\u201cThe world is beautiful, and outside there is no\nsalvation\u201d (N, 103). Only in accepting death and in\nbeing \u201cstripped of all hope\u201d does one most intensely\nappreciate not only the physical side of life, but also, he now\nsuggests, its affective and interpersonal side. Taken together, and\ncontrary to an unverifiable faith in God and afterlife, these are what\none has and one knows: \u201cTo feel one\u2019s\nties to a land, one\u2019s love for certain men, to know there is\nalways a place where the heart can find rest\u2014these are already\nmany certainties for one man\u2019s life\u201d (N, 90).\n\nOnly if we accept that Nietzsche is right, that God is dead and there\nis only nothingness after we die, will we then fully\nexperience\u2014feel, taste, touch, see, and smell\u2014the joys of\nour bodies and the physical world. Thus the sensuous and lyrical side\nof these essays, their evocative character, is central to the\nargument. Or rather, because Camus is promoting intense, joyous,\nphysical experience as opposed to a self-abnegating religious life,\nrather than developing an argument he asserts that these experiences\nthemselves are the right response. His writing aims to demonstrate\nwhat life means and feels like once we give up hope\nof an afterlife, so that in reading we will be led to\n\u201csee\u201d his point. These essays may be taken as containing\nhighly personal thoughts, a young man\u2019s musings about his\nMediterranean environment, and they scarcely seem to have any system.\nBut they suggest what philosophy is for Camus and how he conceives its\nrelationship to literary expression.\n\nHis early philosophy, then, may be conveyed, if not summed up, in this\npassage from \u201cNuptials at Tipasa\u201d:\n\nIn a moment, when I throw myself down among the absinthe plants to\nbring their scent into my body, I shall know, appearances to the\ncontrary, that I am fulfilling a truth which is the sun\u2019s and\nwhich will also be my death\u2019s. In a sense, it is indeed my life\nthat I am staking here, a life that tastes of warm stone, that is full\nof the signs of the sea and the rising song of the crickets. The\nbreeze is cool and the sky blue. I love this life with abandon and\nwish to speak of it boldly: it makes me proud of my human condition.\nYet people have often told me: there\u2019s nothing to be proud of.\nYes, there is: this sun, this sea, my heart leaping with youth, the\nsalt taste of my body and this vast landscape in which tenderness and\nglory merge in blue and yellow. It is to conquer this that I need my\nstrength and my resources. Everything here leaves me intact, I\nsurrender nothing of myself, and don no mask: learning patiently and\narduously how to live is enough for me, well worth all their arts of\nliving. (N, 69)\n\n\nThe intense and glistening present tells us that we can fully\nexperience and appreciate life only on the condition that we no longer\ntry to avoid our ultimate and absolute death.\n",
