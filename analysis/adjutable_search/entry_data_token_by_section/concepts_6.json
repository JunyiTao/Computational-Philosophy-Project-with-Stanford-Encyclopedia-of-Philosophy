    "main_text": "The structure of concepts || The prototype theory\n2.2 The prototype theory\n\nWhat other type of structure could they have? A non-classical\nalternative that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century\nis the prototype theory (e.g., Hampton 2006). According to\nthis theory, a lexical concept C doesn\u2019t have\ndefinitional structure but has probabilistic structure in that\nsomething falls under C just in case it satisfies a\nsufficient number of properties encoded by C\u2019s\nconstituents. The prototype theory has its philosophical roots in\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1953/1958) famous remark that the things covered\nby a term often share a family resemblance, and it has its\npsychological roots in Eleanor Rosch\u2019s groundbreaking\nexperimental treatment of much the same idea (Rosch & Mervis 1975,\nRosch 1978). The prototype theory is especially at home in dealing\nwith the typicality effects that were left unexplained by the\nclassical theory. One standard strategy is to maintain that, on the\nprototype theory, categorization is to be understood as a similarity\ncomparison process, where similarity is computed as a function of the\nnumber of constituents that two concepts hold in common. On this\nmodel, the reason apples are judged to be more typical than plums is\nthat the concept APPLE shares more of its constituents with FRUIT.\nLikewise, this is why apples are judged to be a kind of fruit faster\nthan plums are.\n\nThe prototype theory does well in accounting for a variety of\npsychological phenomena and it helps to explain why definitions may be\nso hard to produce. But the prototype theory has its own problems and\nlimitations. One is that its treatment of categorization works best\nfor quick and unreflective judgments. Yet when it comes to more\nreflective judgments, people go beyond the outcome of a similarity\ncomparison. If asked whether a dog that is surgically altered to look\nlike a raccoon is a dog or a raccoon, the answer for most of us, and\neven for children, is that it is remains a dog (see Keil 1989, Gelman\n2003 for discussion). Another criticism that has been raised against\ntaking concepts to have prototype structure concerns compositionality.\nWhen a patently complex concept has a prototype structure, it often\nhas emergent properties, ones that don\u2019t derive from the\nprototypes of its constituents (e.g., PET FISH encodes properties such\nas brightly colored, which have no basis in the prototype structure\nfor either PET or FISH). Further, many patently complex concepts\ndon\u2019t even have a prototype structure (e.g., CHAIRS THAT WERE\nPURCHASED ON A WEDNESDAY) (Fodor & Lepore 1996, Fodor 1998; for\nresponses to the arguments from compositionality, see Prinz 2002,\nRobbins 2002, Hampton & J\u00f6nsson 2012, and Del Pinal\n2016).\n\nOne general solution that addresses all of these problems is to hold\nthat a prototype constitutes just part of the structure of a concept.\nIn addition, concepts have conceptual cores, which specify\nthe information relevant to more considered judgments and which\nunderwrite compositional processes. Of course, this just raises the\nquestion of what sort of structure conceptual cores have. One\nsuggestion is that conceptual cores have classical structure (Osherson\n& Smith 1981, Landau 1982). This won\u2019t do, however, since it\njust raises once again most of the problems associated with the\nclassical theory (Laurence & Margolis 1999).\n",
