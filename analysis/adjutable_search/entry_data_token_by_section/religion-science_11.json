    "main_text": "Central topics in the debate || Divine action and creation\n3.1 Divine action and creation\n\nBefore scientists developed their views on cosmology and origins of\nthe world, Western cultures already had a doctrine of creation, based\non biblical texts (e.g., the first three chapters of Genesis and the\nbook of Revelation) and the writings of church fathers such as\nAugustine. This doctrine of creation has the following interrelated\nfeatures: first, God created the world ex nihilo, i.e., out\nof nothing. Differently put, God did not need any pre-existing\nmaterials to make the world, unlike, e.g., the Demiurge (from Greek\nphilosophy), who created the world from chaotic, pre-existing matter.\nSecond, God is distinct from the world; the world is not equal to or\npart of God (contra pantheism or panentheism) or a (necessary)\nemanation of God\u2019s being (contra Neoplatonism). Rather, God\ncreated the world freely. This introduces an asymmetry between creator\nand creature: the world is radically contingent upon God\u2019s\ncreative act and is also sustained by God, whereas God does not need\ncreation (Jaeger 2012b: 3). Third, the doctrine of creation holds that\ncreation is essentially good (this is repeatedly affirmed in Genesis\n1). The world does contain evil, but God does not directly cause this\nevil to exist. Moreover, God does not merely passively sustain\ncreation, but rather plays an active role in it, using special divine\nactions (e.g., miracles and revelations) to care for creatures.\nFourth, God made provisions for the end of the world, and will create\na new heaven and earth, in this way eradicating evil.\n\nViews on divine action are related to the doctrine of creation.\nTheologians commonly draw a distinction between general and special\ndivine action, but within the field of science and religion there is\nno universally accepted definition of these two concepts. One way to\ndistinguish them (Wildman 2008: 140) is to regard general divine\naction as the creation and sustenance of reality, and special divine\naction as the collection of specific providential acts, such as\nmiracles and revelations to prophets. Drawing this distinction allows\nfor creatures to be autonomous and indicates that God does not\nmicromanage every detail of creation. Still, the distinction is not\nalways clear-cut, as some phenomena are difficult to classify as\neither general or special divine action. For example, the Roman\nCatholic Eucharist (in which bread and wine become the body and blood\nof Jesus) or some healing miracles outside of scripture seem mundane\nenough to be part of general housekeeping (general divine action), but\nstill seem to involve some form of special intervention on God\u2019s\npart. Alston (1989) makes a related distinction between direct and\nindirect divine acts. God brings about direct acts without the use of\nnatural causes, whereas indirect acts are achieved through natural\ncauses. Using this distinction, there are four possible kinds of\nactions that God could do: God could not act in the world at all, God\ncould act only directly, God could act only indirectly, or God could\nact both directly and indirectly.\n\nIn the science and religion literature, there are two central\nquestions on creation and divine action. To what extent are the\nChristian doctrine of creation and traditional views of divine action\ncompatible with science? How can these concepts be understood within a\nscientific context, e.g., what does it mean for God to create and act?\nNote that the doctrine of creation says nothing about the age of the\nEarth, nor does it specify a mode of creation. This allows for a wide\nrange of possible views within science and religion, of which Young\nEarth creationism is but one that is consistent with scripture.\nIndeed, some scientific theories, such as the Big Bang theory, first\nproposed by the Belgian Roman Catholic priest and astronomer Georges\nLema\u00eetre (1927), look congenial to the doctrine of creation. The\ntheory is not in contradiction, and could be integrated into\ncreatio ex nihilo as it specifies that the universe\noriginated from an extremely hot and dense state around 13.8 billion\nyears ago (Craig 2003), although some philosophers have argued against\nthe interpretation that the universe has a temporal beginning (e.g.,\nPitts 2008).\n\nThe net result of scientific findings since the seventeenth century\nhas been that God was increasingly pushed into the margins. This\nencroachment of science on the territory of religion happened in two\nways: first, scientific findings\u2014in particular from geology and\nevolutionary theory\u2014challenged and replaced biblical accounts of\ncreation. Although the doctrine of creation does not contain details\nof the mode and timing of creation, the Bible was regarded as\nauthoritative, and that authority got eroded by the sciences. Second,\nthe emerging concept of scientific laws in seventeenth- and\neighteenth-century physics seemed to leave no room for special divine\naction. These two challenges will be discussed below, along with\nproposed solutions in the contemporary science and religion\nliterature.\n\nChristian authors have traditionally used the Bible as a source of\nhistorical information. Biblical exegesis of the creation narratives,\nespecially Genesis 1 and 2 (and some other scattered passages, such as\nin the Book of Job), remains fraught with difficulties. Are these\ntexts to be interpreted in a historical, metaphorical, or poetic\nfashion, and what are we to make of the fact that the order of\ncreation differs between these accounts (Harris 2013)? The Anglican\narchbishop James Ussher (1581\u20131656) used the Bible to date the\nbeginning of creation at 4004 BCE. Although such literalist\ninterpretations of the biblical creation narratives were not uncommon,\nand are still used by Young Earth creationists today, theologians\nbefore Ussher already offered alternative, non-literalist readings of\nthe biblical materials (e.g., Augustine De Genesi ad\nlitteram, 416). From the seventeenth century onward, the\nChristian doctrine of creation came under pressure from geology, with\nfindings suggesting that the Earth was significantly older than 4004\nBCE. From the eighteenth century on, natural philosophers, such as\nBeno\u00eet de Maillet, Lamarck, Chambers, and Darwin, proposed\ntransmutationist (what would now be called evolutionary) theories,\nwhich seem incompatible with scriptural interpretations of the special\ncreation of species. Following the publication of Darwin\u2019s\nOrigin of Species (1859), there has been an ongoing\ndiscussion on how to reinterpret the doctrine of creation in the light\nof evolutionary theory (see Bowler 2009 for an overview).\n\nTed Peters and Martinez Hewlett (2003) have outlined a divine action\nspectrum to clarify the distinct positions about creation and divine\naction in the contemporary science and religion literature that\nfocuses on Christians, agnostics, and atheists. They discern two\ndimensions in this spectrum: the degree of divine action in the\nnatural world, and the form of causal explanations that relate divine\naction to natural processes. At one extreme are creationists. Like\nother theists, they believe God has created the world and its\nfundamental laws, and that God occasionally performs special divine\nactions (miracles) that intervene in the fabric of those laws.\nCreationists deny any role of natural selection in the origin of\nspecies. Within creationism, there are Old and Young Earth\ncreationism, with the former accepting geology and rejecting\nevolutionary biology, and the latter rejecting both. Next to\ncreationism is Intelligent Design, which affirms divine intervention\nin natural processes. Intelligent Design creationists (e.g., Dembski\n1998) believe there is evidence of intelligent design in\norganisms\u2019 irreducible complexity; on the basis of this they\ninfer design and purposiveness (see Kojonen 2016). Like other\ncreationists, they deny a significant role for natural selection in\nshaping organic complexity and they affirm an interventionist account\nof divine action. For political reasons they do not label their\nintelligent designer as God, as they hope to circumvent the\nconstitutional separation of church and state in the US which\nprohibits teaching religious doctrines in public schools (Forrest\n& Gross 2004). Theistic evolutionists hold a non-interventionist\napproach to divine action: God creates indirectly, through the laws of\nnature (e.g., through natural selection). For example, the theologian\nJohn Haught (2000) regards divine providence as self-giving love, and\nnatural selection and other natural processes as manifestations of\nthis love, as they foster creaturely autonomy and independence. While\ntheistic evolutionists allow for special divine action, particularly\nthe miracle of the Incarnation in Christ (e.g., Deane-Drummond 2009),\ndeists such as Michael Corey (1994) think there is only general divine\naction: God has laid out the laws of nature and lets it run like\nclockwork without further interference. Deism is still a long distance\nfrom ontological materialism, the view that the material world is all\nthere is. Ontological materialists tend to hold that the universe is\nintelligible, with laws that scientists can discover, but there is no\nlawgiver and no creator.\n\nViews on divine action were influenced by developments in physics and\ntheir philosophical interpretation. In the seventeenth century,\nnatural philosophers, such as Robert Boyle and John Wilkins, developed\na mechanistic view of the world as governed by orderly and lawlike\nprocesses. Laws, understood as immutable and stable, created\ndifficulties for the concept of special divine action (Pannenberg\n2002). How could God act in a world that was determined by laws?\n\nOne way to regard miracles and other forms of special divine action is\nto see them as actions that somehow suspend or ignore the laws of\nnature. David Hume (1748: 181), for instance, defined a miracle as\n\u201ca transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of\nthe deity, or by the interposal of some invisible agent\u201d, and,\nmore recently, Richard Swinburne (1968: 320) defines a miracle as\n\u201ca violation of a law of Nature by a god\u201d. This concept of\ndivine action is commonly labeled interventionist. Interventionism\nregards the world as causally deterministic, so God has to create room\nfor special divine actions. By contrast, non-interventionist forms of\ndivine action require a world that is, at some level,\nnon-deterministic, so that God can act without having to suspend or\nignore the laws of nature.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, the explanation of the workings of nature\nin terms of elegant physical laws suggested the ingenuity of a divine\ndesigner. The design argument reached its peak during the seventeenth\nand early eighteenth century (McGrath 2011). For example, Samuel\nClarke (1705: part XI, cited in Schliesser 2012: 451) proposed an\na posteriori argument from design by appealing to Newtonian\nscience, calling attention to the \n\n\nexquisite regularity of all the planets\u2019 motions without\nepicycles, stations, retrogradations, or any other deviation or\nconfusion whatsoever. \n\n\nA late proponent of this view of nature as a perfect smooth machine is\nWilliam Paley\u2019s Natural Theology (1802).\n\nAnother conclusion that the new laws-based physics suggested was that\nthe universe was able to run smoothly without requiring an intervening\nGod. The increasingly deterministic understanding of the universe,\nruled by deterministic causal laws as, for example, outlined by\nPierre-Simon Laplace (1749\u20131827), seemed to leave no room for\nspecial divine action, which is a key element of the traditional\nChristian doctrine of creation. Newton resisted interpretations like\nthese in an addendum to the Principia in 1713: the\nplanets\u2019 motions could be explained by laws of gravity, but the\npositions of their orbits, and the positions of the stars\u2014far\nenough apart so as not to influence each other\ngravitationally\u2014required a divine explanation (Schliesser 2012).\nAlston (1989) argued, contra authors such as Polkinghorne (1998), that\nmechanistic, pre-twentieth century physics is compatible with divine\naction and divine free will. Assuming a completely deterministic world\nand divine omniscience, God could set up initial conditions and the\nlaws of nature in such a way as to bring God\u2019s plans about. In\nsuch a mechanistic world, every event is an indirect divine act.\n\nAdvances in twentieth-century physics, including the theories of\ngeneral and special relativity, chaos theory, and quantum theory,\noverturned the mechanical clockwork view of creation. In the latter\nhalf of the twentieth century, chaos theory and quantum physics have\nbeen explored as possible avenues to reinterpret divine action. John\nPolkinghorne (1998) proposed that chaos theory not only presents\nepistemological limits to what we can know about the world, but that\nit also provides the world with an \u201contological openness\u201d\nin which God can operate without violating the laws of nature. One\ndifficulty with this model is that it moves from our knowledge of the\nworld to assumptions about how the world is: does chaos theory mean\nthat outcomes are genuinely undetermined, or that we as limited\nknowers cannot predict them? Robert Russell (2006) proposed that God\nacts in quantum events. This would allow God to directly act in nature\nwithout having to contravene the laws of nature. His is therefore a\nnon-interventionist model: since, under the Copenhagen interpretation\nof quantum mechanics, there are no natural efficient causes at the\nquantum level, God is not reduced to a natural cause. Murphy (1995)\noutlined a similar bottom-up model where God acts in the space\nprovided by quantum indeterminacy. These attempts to locate\nGod\u2019s actions either in chaos theory or quantum mechanics, which\nLydia Jaeger (2012a) has termed \u201cphysicalism-plus-God\u201d,\nhave met with sharp criticism (e.g., Saunders 2002; Jaeger 2012a,b).\nAfter all, it is not even clear whether quantum theory would allow for\nfree human action, let alone divine action, which we do not know much\nabout (Jaeger 2012a). Next to this, William Carroll (2008), building\non Thomistic philosophy, argues that authors such as Polkinghorne and\nMurphy are making a category mistake: God is not a cause in the way\ncreatures are causes, competing with natural causes, and God does not\nneed indeterminacy in order to act in the world. Rather, as primary\ncause God supports and grounds secondary causes. While this\nneo-Thomistic proposal is compatible with determinism (indeed, on this\nview, the precise details of physics do not matter much), it blurs the\ndistinction between general and special divine action. Moreover, the\nIncarnation suggests that the idea of God as a cause among natural\ncauses is not an alien idea in theology, and that God incarnate as\nJesus at least sometimes acts as a natural cause (Sollereder\n2015).\n\nThere has been a debate on the question to what extent randomness is a\ngenuine feature of creation, and how divine action and chance\ninterrelate. Chance and stochasticity are important features of\nevolutionary theory (the non-random retention of random variations).\nIn a famous thought experiment, Gould (1989) imagined that we could\nrewind the tape of life back to the time of the Burgess Shale (508\nmillion years ago); the chance that a rerun of the tape of life would\nend up with anything like the present-day life forms is vanishingly\nsmall. However, Simon Conway Morris (2003) has insisted species very\nsimilar to the ones we know now, including humans, would evolve under\na broad range of conditions.\n\nUnder a theist interpretation, randomness could either be a merely\napparent aspect of creation, or a genuine feature. Plantinga suggests\nthat randomness is a physicalist interpretation of the evidence. God\nmay have guided every mutation along the evolutionary process. In this\nway, God could\n\n\nguide the course of evolutionary history by causing the right\nmutations to arise at the right time and preserving the forms of life\nthat lead to the results he intends. (2011: 121)\n\n\nBy contrast, other authors see stochasticity as a genuine design\nfeature, and not just as a physicalist gloss. Their challenge is to\nexplain how divine providence is compatible with genuine randomness.\n(Under a deistic view, one could simply say that God started the\nuniverse up and did not interfere with how it went, but that option is\nnot open to the theist, and most authors in the field of science and\nreligion are not deists.) The neo-Thomist Elizabeth Johnson (1996)\nargues that divine providence and true randomness are compatible: God\ngives creatures true causal powers, thus making creation more\nexcellent than if they lacked such powers. Random occurrences are also\nsecondary causes. Chance is a form of divine creativity that creates\nnovelty, variety, and freedom. One implication of this view is that\nGod may be a risk taker\u2014although, if God has a providential plan\nfor possible outcomes, there is unpredictability but not risk. Johnson\nuses metaphors of risk taking that, on the whole, leave the creator in\na position of control. Creation, then, is akin to jazz improvisation.\nWhy would God take risks? There are several solutions to this\nquestion. The free will theodicy says that a creation that exhibits\nstochasticity can be truly free and autonomous:\n\n\nAuthentic love requires freedom, not manipulation. Such freedom is\nbest supplied by the open contingency of evolution, and not by strings\nof divine direction attached to every living creature. (Miller 1999\n[2007: 289])\n\n\nThe \u201conly way theodicy\u201d goes a step further, arguing that\na combination of laws and chance is not only the best way, but the\nonly way for God to achieve God\u2019s creative plans (see, e.g.,\nSouthgate 2008 for a defense).\n",
