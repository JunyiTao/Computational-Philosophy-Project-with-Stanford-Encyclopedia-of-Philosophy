    "main_text": "Non-Contradiction and Metaphysics\n11. Non-Contradiction and Metaphysics\n\nTwo frequent themes of Aristotle\u2019s account of science are (1)\nthat the first principles of sciences are not demonstrable and (2)\nthat there is no single universal science including all other sciences\nas its parts. \u201cAll things are not in a single genus\u201d, he\nsays, \u201cand even if they were, all beings could not fall under\nthe same principles\u201d (On Sophistical Refutations 11).\nThus, it is exactly the universal applicability of dialectic that\nleads him to deny it the status of a science.\n\nIn Metaphysics IV (\u0393), however, Aristotle takes what\nappears to be a different view. First, he argues that there is, in a\nway, a science that takes being as its genus (his name for it is\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d). Second, he argues that the principles\nof this science will be, in a way, the first principles of all (though\nhe does not claim that the principles of other sciences can be\ndemonstrated from them). Third, he identifies one of its first\nprinciples as the \u201cmost secure\u201d of all principles: the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. As he states it,\n\nIt is impossible for the same thing to belong and not belong\nsimultaneously to the same thing in the same respect (Met. )\n\n\nThis is the most secure of all principles, Aristotle tells us, because\n\u201cit is impossible to be in error about it\u201d. Since it is a\nfirst principle, it cannot be demonstrated; those who think otherwise\nare \u201cuneducated in analytics\u201d. However, Aristotle then\nproceeds to give what he calls a \u201crefutative\ndemonstration\u201d (apodeixai elenktik\u00f4s) of this\nprinciple.\n\nFurther discussion of this principle and Aristotle\u2019s arguments\nconcerning it belong to a treatment of his metaphysics (see\n Aristotle: Metaphysics).\n However, it should be noted that: (1) these arguments draw on\nAristotle\u2019s views about logic to a greater extent than any\ntreatise outside the logical works themselves; (2) in the logical\nworks, the principle of non-contradiction is one of Aristotle\u2019s\nfavorite illustrations of the \u201ccommon principles\u201d\n(koinai archai) that underlie the art of dialectic.\n\nSee\n Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics,\n Aristotle on non-contradiction, Dancy 1975, and Code 1986 for further discussion.\n",
