    "main_text": "Arts and Sciences\n2. Arts and Sciences\n\n\nThe Aristotelian distinction between arts (artes) and\nsciences (scientiae) serves as the starting-point for\nZabarella\u2019s philosophical system. At the beginning of his Opera\nlogica, Zabarella draws a distinction between the eternal world\nof nature and the contingent human world. From this distinction he\nproceeds to two corresponding kinds of knowledge, and two distinct\nmethods of defining them. Zabarella maintained that, properly\nspeaking, sciences are concerned with the eternal world of nature and\nthus are contemplative disciplines, whereas arts are concerned with\nthe contingent world of human beings and thus are non-contemplative,\nbeing productive instead. The sciences in the proper sense of that\nterm, as pertaining to demonstrative knowledge, are limited to those\ndisciplines that deal with the necessary and eternal or with what can\nbe deduced from necessary principles. Zabarella notes that Aristotle\nrequires two kinds of certainty from science. One is in the knowable\nthings, which are necessary as such (simpliciter); the other\nis in the mind of the scientist, who must be absolutely sure that\nthings cannot be otherwise. The necessity involved is therefore both\nontological, with respects to the objects known, and cognitive, with\nrespect to the knowing subject (Kessler 1998, p. 837).\n\n\nThe hierarchy of different disciplines was a widely debated topic in\nRenaissance philosophy. Also Zabarella emphasized the hierarchical\nnature of the division between different disciplines; the whole of\nactive philosophy aiming ultimately at the higher sphere of\ncontemplation. According to Zabarella, both in Plato and Aristotle\nhappiness in the active life is not the ultimate goal for a human\nbeing. Instead it is contemplation, which is man\u2019s finest objective\nthat may lead to total perfection. In Zabarella\u2019s view the purpose of\nactive philosophy is to remove hindrance to the acquisition of\nknowledge and therefore contemplative philosophy is the ultimate end\nand master of all active philosophy. In productive disciplines (i.e.,\narts) it is not necessary to define the objects under production as\nstrictly as in the contemplative sciences, because the productive arts\ndo not aim at knowledge, and thus the knowledge they need do not have\nto be perfect.\n\n\nZabarella identifies therefore the basic difference between arts and\nsciences. Science deals with what already exists, but art is concerned\nwith creation. The subject-matter of a science is immutable, but the\nsubject-matter of an art is the formation of things as yet\nnon-existent, but which can be made by human being. The contemplative\nphilosopher is not interested in initiating anything, but rather wants\nto comprehend and arrange the forms of existing, eternal things.\nMoreover, the ultimate purpose of the contemplative science is the\npursuit of knowledge for its own sake, but in the productive arts the\nend-result is an actual product (Mikkeli 1997, pp. 212\u2013213).\n\n\nHowever, Zabarella was not concerned solely with the separation\nbetween the theoretical sciences and the practical and productive\ndisciplines, but dealt also with the relationships and hierarchy among\nthe theoretical sciences themselves. The contemplative or speculative\nsciences, for Zabarella, are in Aristotelian manner only three in\nnumber: divine science, also called metaphysics, mathematics, and\nnatural philosophy. Zabarella presents these contemplative sciences as\nbeing the only defenders of true knowledge. Zabarella emphasised in\nmany instances that each speculative science should demonstrate their\nown principles and not borrow them from metaphysics. According to\nZabarella, each discipline can be distinguished from others either\nwith respect to the object considered (res considerata) or\nwith respect to the way of considering (modus considerandi)\n(Pozzo 1998).  Natural philosophy, which deals with corporeal beings\nthat have an inner principle of movement, differs from metaphysics\n(which contemplates being as being) and from mathematics (which deals\nwith abstracted beings) in both ways. As a result, natural philosophy\nis autonomous and independent of both the other contemplative\nsciences.\n\n\nZabarella also developed a theory of the middle (or mixed) sciences\nthat, contrary to the prevailing view, afforded sciences such as\nastronomy and optics full demonstrative status despite their borrowing\nprinciples from pure mathematics. Nevertheless, Zabarella\u2019s approach\nto the study of nature remained causal and qualitative in the\ntraditional Aristotelian vein rather than mathematical. Therefore he\ngave little attention to the possible uses of mathematics as a tool\nfor understanding the physical world (Laird 1983, Ch. 8).\n",
