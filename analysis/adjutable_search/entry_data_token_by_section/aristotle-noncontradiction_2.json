    "main_text": "The Elenctic Method and Transcendental Arguments\n3. The Elenctic Method and Transcendental Arguments\n\nAlthough PNC is not subject to demonstration, it is subject to\n\u201celenctic refutation\u201d according to Aristotle. The\n\u201celenchus\u201d refers to the Socratic method of argument. When\nSocrates uses the elenchus, he gets his opponent to refute himself out\nof his own mouth. The opponent makes a proposal that is shown to\nconflict with other claims to which he agrees. To be consistent, the\nopponent must give up one of these claims, and he usually abandons the\noriginal proposal. This is the method of reductio ad absurdum\nfamiliar to ancient Greek geometers and modern formal logicians and\nmathematicians.\n\nThe idea of using an elenchus is at first sight very puzzling. The\nperson claiming to reject PNC is not being consistent and apparently\ndoes not want to be. Aristotle is not trying to catch the opponent in\na formal contradiction. The opponent purportedly does not care about\nthat, and it would be begging the question. Instead, Aristotle\u2019s\ntrick is to draw the opponent into saying something, without making a\ncomplete statement, that shows that he does accept that x is\nF and is not at the same time not F, in spite of the\nwords he previously said. In other words, Aristotle needs to show that\nhis opponent is committed to at least one thing that is not\ncontradictory. The Socratic method is turned on its head.\n\nIt has long been noted that Aristotle is here assuming that his\nopponent takes the very strong position that for any x and\nfor any F, it is possible for F to belong and not to\nbelong to x at the same time in the same respect &c.\nLater he says that he is glad to have stamped out the view according\nto which we do not have anything definite in our thinking\n(Metaph IV 4 1009a3\u20135).\n\nAristotle\u2019s \u201celenctic refutation\u201d has been\nfruitfully compared to a Kantian transcendental argument.\nTranscendental arguments generally run as follows: If certain aspects\nof experience or thinking are possible, the world must be a certain\nway. Since these aspects of experience or thinking do exist, the world\nis a certain way. These aspects of our experience or thinking\npresuppose that the world is a certain way. That the world is\na certain way explains these aspects of our experience or thinking and\nnot the other way round. On this interpretation, Aristotle would be\narguing that the world conforms to PNC, or that PNC is true, because\nit is presupposed by and explains the opponent\u2019s ability to say\nsomething significant.\n\nTranscendental arguments are controversial. One controversy surrounds\nthe precise content of their conclusions and what exactly is\npresupposed. Should one conclude that the world must be a certain way\nor merely that we have to think that it is a certain way, in order to\nhave the experience and thoughts at issue? The modern debate finds its\ncounterpart in debate among scholars about what Aristotle is aiming to\ndo in his elenctic discussion. There are two main possibilities.\nAristotle may be aiming to show that the ontological version of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction is true, or he may be aiming to show\nmerely that it cannot be disbelieved.\n",
