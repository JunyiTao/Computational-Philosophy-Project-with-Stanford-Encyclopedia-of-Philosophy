Life\n\nRecent studies have shed light on Kaspi\u2019s life such as his place\nof birth and the dates of his death and marriage. We can distinguish\nthree periods in Kaspi\u2019s life:\n\n1. Kaspi\u2019s birth until his return from Egypt. Joseph b.\nAbba Mari ibn Kaspi was born circa 1280 in Arles in Provence (or in\nArgenti\u00e8re, in the Languedoc region). In 1314, he traveled to\nEgypt in 1314 for five months:\n\nTwenty years ago, I was exiled to a place reputed for learning\u2026\nI crossed to Egypt, where I visited the College of that renowned and\nperfect sage, the Guide [=Maimonides]. I found there the fourth and\nfifth generations of his holy seed, all righteous, but none devoted to\nscience. In all the Orient there were no scholars\u2026 (Sefer\nHaMussar p.98)\n\n\nAs we see, his expectations\u2014of delving into Maimonidean thought\nthrough learning from Rabbi Abraham the Nagid\u2014were not\nmet. However, his exegesis was enriched by the things he saw on the\njourney.\n\nWe do not know of independent books by Kaspi from this period. He\nwrote a supercommentary on Ibn Ezra\u2019s commentary on the Bible,\nand a commentary on Sefer HaRikma by Ibn Janah.\n\n2. Kaspi\u2019s second Proven\u00e7al period\n(1314\u20131330), where he chiefly first in Arles, then\nin Tarascon. During this period, Kaspi apparently married and his\ntwo children, David, the eldest and Shlomo (1320), were born. In Arles\nKaspi completed his philosophical work Tirat Kesef (1317),\nwhich was harshly criticized by the scholars of Salon through\nKalonymus (1318). \n\n3. The Spanish period in Kaspi\u2019s life: 1330\u20131345.\nIn 1330, Kaspi moved from Tarascon to Spain, living with his family\nfor several years in Perpignan (from 1336), followed by Barcelona,\nMajorca, Valencia and Tudela. We know that Kaspi died in Majorca in\n1345 but now how he lived there. It seems that he traveled there to be\nalone and write, though this is uncertain. In the Spanish period Kaspi\nwrote many books, including three books on logic and linguistics:\n\u1e92eror HaKesef, a brief summary of parts of\nthe Organon for his son; Retuqot Kesef, an\napplication of the rules of logic to Hebrew and Hebrew grammar;\nSharshot Kesef, a Hebrew dictionary. These three books\nare among the most original and essential of Kaspi\u2019s work, and\nnone of them has been printed. Kaspi was well educated. Besides Hebrew\nand Proven\u00e7al, he was apparently also proficient in Arabic and\nLatin. He was familiar with the classical Hebrew religious literature,\nsuch as the Talmud and earlier Bible commentaries, and well-versed in\nthe works of Maimonides and his translator, Samuel ibn Tibbon. He was\nprobably also familiar with Falaquera\u2019s commentary on The\nGuide of the Perplexed. However, his knowledge of Halakhic\nliterature was limited by his own admission. Among the philosophers,\nhe mentions Averroes, Avicenna, Boethius, al-F\u0101r\u0101bi, and\nGalen, in addition to Plato and Aristotle.\n2. Exegesis\n\nKaspi considered himself primarily a commentator. He distinguishes\nbetween a \u201ccommentary\u201d (perush) and an\nindependent work (\u1e25ibbur), declaring, \u201cI do not\ndefine a work as a \u2018commentary\u2019 unless it brings us to the\nreal intention of the author of the book\u201d (Commentary on the\nSong of Songs, p. 184). Nevertheless, he sometimes admits his\ninability to prove that his interpretation represents the\nauthor\u2019s real meaning, particularly when that\n\u201cauthor\u201d is the biblical one, i.e., God, Himself:\n\nI do not assert that the intention of its Giver [= of the Torah] was\nthose same purposes that I have assumed, for perhaps those were not\nintended, but he combined them with other intentions, presently hidden\nfrom us\u2026 For the same thing may have many purposes that do not\nnecessarily contradict one another\u2026 Nevertheless what I\nsay\u2026, whether I prophesy their author\u2019s intentions or\nnot, what I say is true, that we have learned such and such a matter\nfrom the subject of the narratives (Tirat Kesef, p. 64).\n\n\nUnderstanding the author\u2019s intention is thus seen as a kind of\nprophecy (\u201cwhether I prophesy the\nintention\u2026\u201d). Kaspi\u2019s interpretative truth, he\ninsists, is concerned not with the author and his intention, but with\nthe reader and his or her understanding: The commentator can speak for\nhimself alone. Such exegesis is subjective, dependent on each of the\nwork\u2019s innumerable readers. Nevertheless, Kaspi is sometimes\nreasonably sure of the author\u2019s meaning:\n\nI have revealed to you what the Lord revealed to us of His secrets,\nfor I think that we have thereby arrived in this chapter at the\nauthor\u2019s intention; \u201cthe truth,\u201d as Aristotle says,\n\u201cis its own witness, agreeing in every aspect.\u201d The\nmeaning of \u201cagreeing in every aspect\u201d is in what he\nexplained, saying, \u201cthat one aspect thereof attests to [another]\naspect\u2026\u201d\u2026 Now our own Sages of blessed memory have\nalready said, \u201cwords of truth are recognizable\u201d\n[Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 9b] (Tirat Kesef, p. 83).\n\n\nHere, Kaspi boldly implies  that God somehow informed\nhim of the secret hidden in the text. The criterion of his\ncertainty is coherence. However, given Kaspi\u2019s own theology (see\nbelow), he was not claiming to have received a supernatural\nrevelation. Despite what some consider to be a radical adherence to\nAristotelian philosophy, Kaspi had a conservative outlook on\neverything concerning the written word of the Bible and the way it is\nread. He maintained that the written word, or its reading, has not\nchanged since the early sages of the Second Temple period . The way in\nwhich Jews write the Torah scroll is the same as in the original\nversion. The square-like Assyrian lettering, known from the Torah\nscrolls of today, was the same as that given to Moses at Sinai. Even\nthe division into the five books, including the weekly portions, were\nall present from the early sages of the Second Temple period. Kaspi\ndifferentiated between the early sages of the Second Temple period\n(who held traditions received from Moses, and therefore reflect the\nintent of the writer of the Torah), and later sages, the\nTanna\u2019im and Amora\u2019im of rabbinic writings, whose\ninterpretations of the biblical narrative may be disputed if they\ndisagree with the plain interpretation of the Bible.\n3. Logic\n\nTwo definitions emerge for the role of Logic after looking at\nKaspi\u2019s comments:\n\nLogic determines the correctness of our beliefs.  It is not a\nmatter of psychological rules, but of regulative rules that serve as a\nmarker and a guide to the correct way of thinking.\nLogic determines the proper use of the language. This is not a\nmatter of conventional rules that result from the structure of a\ncertain language, but of the rules of a universal syntax that\napplies to all languages. The delineation of the work of logic is\nnothing more than a match between \u201cexternal\u201d and\n\u201cinternal\u201d speech (Sharshot Kesef, p. 1), a\ncommonplace in his philosophical antecedents.\n\n\nKaspi accused his predecessors of misunderstanding Scripture because\nthey had not used logic:\n\nThe truth has evaded some of the commentators in this, and other\nmatters, in many places, for they are ignorant of the science of\nlogic, and even if some of them do know it, they do not remember its\nfoundations when they comment (Commentary on Esther, p. 32).\n\n\nAs noted above, Kaspi himself, wrote a brief compendium on logic\n(\u1e92eror ha-Kesef) in which he summarized what he\nbelieved were important principles for a correct interpretation of\nScripture. He omitted discussion of dialectic, rhetoric, and poetics,\nwhich he considered irrelevant to his task.  His exegesis\napplies various techniques: categorizing genera and species,\ndistinguishing between essential and non-essential qualities,\nasserting the symmetry of relation, understanding the law of\ncontradiction, and recognizing valid and invalid syllogisms, in\naddition to logical fallacies. For example, he criticizes commentators\nwho conclude from the truth of a proposition that its parts are also\ntrue. To illustrate this, he cites the verse \u201cThere was no man\nto till the soil\u201d (Genesis 2:5). This verse does not imply that\nthere were no human beings at the time, a proposition at variance with\nthe Aristotelian thesis (to which Kaspi apparently subscribed) that\nthe world has always existed alongside God.\n4. Logic and the Hebrew language\n\nKaspi was deeply concerned with the status of the Hebrew language.\nWhile agreeing with Aristotle that languages are conventional rather\nthan natural, he places Hebrew on a higher level, arguing that its\ncombinations of letters into words are not accidental. A Hebrew word\ndenotes the qualities of the object designated, and there is a\none-to-one relation between words and their\ndesignata. According to Kaspi, Hebrew is the ideal\nlanguage because its nouns attest to their characteristics,\nwhether essential or incidental. Man is called adam in\nHebrew because he originates [partly] from the earth (Hebrew:\nadama); ish because he originates partly\nfrom fire (Hebrew: esh) and enosh because of\nhis worthless and expendable nature (the Hebrew root\na-n-sh, claims Kaspi, designates\ndestruction and loss; Retuqot Kesef, p. 44).\n\nGeneralization is another critical principle derived from logic in\nKaspi\u2019s conception of language. Logic rests partly on the\ndivision between the general and the specific. Genus is defined as the\nmost general and comprehensive set of all. A species constitutes a\nsubset of a genus with a specific difference, but its particulars also\npossess non-essential properties. According to this principle,\nclaims Kaspi, a speaker is not obligated to reveal all particulars in\nhis choice of words. He thereby blurs boundaries in both language\nmorphology (such as differences in gender, number and time) and\nsyntax. Kaspi maintains that the grammatical means a speaker adopts to\nexpress these differences constitute superfluous information.\nConsequently, nothing is peculiar about a text that uses the male\ninstead of the female gender and so on. \u201cIt is not obligatory to\ninsist on gender consistency. A masculine name may well be accompanied\nby a feminine adjective or verb and vice versa. We have been fortunate\nto find textual gender consistency in a few places, but we should not\nfind it unusual if it is lacking in others\u201d (Retuqot\nKesef, p. 15). In a similar vein, Kaspi writes about texts that\nuse the singular instead of the plural, past tense instead of the\nfuture, or texts that lack the concept of a sentence or other\nsyntactic structures.\n5. Philosophical principles in lexicographic methodology\n\nIn Kaspi\u2019s view, all Hebrew words are distinct; Hebrew has no\nabsolute synonyms or homonyms. In support of this view, he wrote a\nkind of dictionary of the roots of biblical Hebrew (Sharshot\nKesef. The dictionary is based on two main assumptions:\n\nThere are no real homonyms. Kaspi determines the principle of the\ncommon denominator a priori, an economic principle of logic according\nto which the root has a chief meaning that includes all words derived\nfrom the same root. In some cases, however, he was forced to adapt the\ndata to conform to the principle. Thus, for example, the root\nl-ch-m denotes \u201copposition and resistance,\u201d and\nfrom it are derived the Hebrew words for \u201cwar\u201d\n(milchamah) and \u201cbread\u201d (lechem). He\nexplains the use of this root for \u201cbread\u201d in light of\nAristotle\u2019s proposition in On the Soul 416 that\n\u201cFood is\u2026 the contrary of what is fed.\u201d Kaspi\nexpresses amazement that anyone should disagree with this principle:\n\u201cFor how could a person think that the creators of the language,\nwho were great scholars, could have used one noun\u2026 for things\nso unrelated\u201d (Sharshot Kesef, ed. Last, p. 29).\nThere are no absolute synonyms. Kaspi, who claims that Hebrew has\nno absolute synonyms for words, worked hard to differentiate among\nsynonyms throughout his dictionary.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, contemporary linguistics discerns two key types of\nmeaning differentiation: (a) between word designata, in which\neach synonym is designated differently:\nquantitatively\u2014rekhev vs. mekhonith (motor\nvehicle vs. automobile); qualitatively\u2014shikor vs.\nmevusam (inebriated vs. tipsy); (b) among registers or layers\nof language (layish vs. aryeh/lion).\n\nKaspi also insists on an additional type of differentiation among\nsynonyms, maintaining that there is but one designatum and even the\ndesignates do not differ. Differences among words are embodied in the\naspects of the designatum that they emphasize. For example, Kaspi\nexplains that the words h\u0323erev, sakkin, maakheleth and\nshelah\u0323 (javelin) are not synonymous because each\ndesignates a different aspect of the object. Kaspi maintains, that all\nthese objects are cutting instruments: knives. One is called\nh\u0323erev because it attests to the destruction\n(h\u0323urban) of those struck by it; a sakkin\ndesignates the stricken victim as subject to danger and then severed\nfrom living creatures (according to Kaspi\u2019s interpretation of\nthe root samekh-kaf-nun). The instructive word\nmaakhelet informs us that the stricken one is slaughtered,\nconsumed (neekhal), terminated and so on. The words\nh\u0323erev, sakkin, maakhelet, and shelah\u0323\nthus designate the same type of tool, a cutting instrument. Different\nwords indicate and describe different phenomena concerning the\ndesignatum, but these are not synonyms.\n\nAnother significant difference between dictionaries produced before\nand up to Kaspi\u2019s time and Sharshoth Kesef is the order\nof discussion of lexical forms. Ibn Janah\u0323 and Radaq, who\npreceded Kaspi, begin by presenting the forms of the verbs derived\nfrom a given Biblical root, followed by the noun forms. Unlike earlier\nlexicographers of Hebrew and Arabic, Kaspi composed a dictionary in\nwhich the nouns derived from the root were described first and the\nrelevant verb form system was only shown afterward. This change in\norder is by no means coincidental. In Retuqot Kesef, Section\n40, Kaspi analyzes the structure of the Hebrew language. First, its\nfounders agreed on the general meaning of each root. Then they coined\nan abstract name designating its meaning that is not connected to any\nparticular object or occurrence. Subsequently, they coined the\nverb\u2019s infinitive, thereby creating the reality to which the\nnoun refers. The infinitive is an abstract noun expressing an\noccurrence. Subsequently, they formed adjectives that are concretely\nconnected with specific objects. After completing the nouns, they\ninvented a system that addresses tangible activity and occurrences. In\nother words, Kaspi maintains that the formation of nouns and the\nvarious weights accorded to them proceed from the most abstract to the\nmost tangible. As the verb system is the most tangible of all, it was\ndevised last.\n6. Theology and anthropology\n\nKaspi bases his biblical exegesis on the conventional theological\nassumptions of the Aristotelian philosophy prevalent among the Jews in\nfourteenth century Southern France. of his times. God is a necessary\nexistent, the unmoved mover, the intellect that intellectually\ncognizes  itself. Kaspi\u2019s description of God as the\nintellect borders on a certain conception of divine\nimmanence:\n\nFor we are our intellect in actu, we bring God into our\nminds, for the intellect is God and God is the intellect\u2026 For\nthat reason, Moses was called \u201ca Man of God\u201d because God\nwas always in his mind\u2026 I mean to say, \u201cdivine\npower,\u201d and there is no difference if one says \u201cGod\u201d\nor \u201cGod\u2019s power,\u201d since that same power is the\nintellect and God is the intellect (Maskiyot Kesef, p. 98).\n\n\nKaspi proposes another radical doctrine in connection with the\nAristotelian conception of God as the intellect, that which\nintellects, and the intellectum: he compares this conception with the\nHoly Trinity of Christian theology. He is even willing to accept a\nmoderate interpretation of the Trinity: \u201cSome individuals among\nthem (the Christians) are similar to us (in opinions)\u201d\n(Gevia\u2018 ha-Kesef, p. 27).\n\nKaspi explains the relationship between God and the world in as\nnaturalistic a manner as possible. He agrees with the position\nattributed to Aristotle and Plato, that the world was not created\nex nihilo at a certain point in time, arguing that this was\nalso Maimonides\u2019 position. In that spirit, Kaspi himself\nproposes a systematic explanation of the creation as described in\nGenesis.\n\nKaspi also understand God\u2019s continual providence of the world in\nentirely naturalistic terms. He interprets biblical miracles as rare\nbut natural phenomena\u2014an idea not dissimilar to Spinoza\u2019s\nteachings. To say that a certain phenomenon is contrary to natural\nlaw, Kaspi writes, is a subjective judgment, \u201cfor there is no\ndoubt that those ignorant of natural science believe many natural\nthings to be miraculous, not natural phenomena\u201d (Tirat\nKesef, p. 12). This may be compared with Spinoza in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus (Chap. 6): \u201c[S]ince\nmiracles were wrought according to the understanding of the masses,\nwho are wholly ignorant of the workings of nature\u2026 we cannot\ndoubt that the causes of many things, narrated in Scripture as\nmiracles could easily be explained by reference to established\nworkings of nature.\u201d Kaspi also holds that a wise prophet is\ncapable of performing miracles thanks to the possession of extensive\nknowledge. Moses, the wisest of men, performed miracles in Egypt\nbecause \u201che had acquired knowledge of the celestial body\u2026\nbecause he had captured the world of the [four sublunar]\nelements\u201d (Menorat Kesef, p. 93). This knowledge\nenabled him to inflict the plagues upon the Egyptians: \u201cWith the\nfour [elements] Moses performed actions that would be impossible for\nany [other] wise man\u201d (Commentary on Proverbs B, p. 127).\n\nDiscussing the relationship between the prophet and the wise man,\nKaspi agrees with the Muslim thinker\nal-Ba\u1e6daly\u016bs\u012b that a person with a prophetic soul\nis superior in level and essence to a wise man with a philosophical\nsoul. Nevertheless, prophecy is not a super-rational phenomenon. A\nprophet\u2019s knowledge of the future is based on deductive\ninference, since he or she is well acquainted with the world and all\ndetails of natural causality.\n\nThe ability of God and the prophets to foresee the future, despite the\napparent contradiction with the principle of (free) choice, also\nreceives a rational explanation. Kaspi proposes an analogy between\ntheir positive knowledge and the knowledge of wise men \u201cwith a\ngood sense of evaluation and estimation,\u201d who are capable of\nforeseeing the probable behavior of a person based on their knowledge\nof his or her character. Like most medieval theologians, Kaspi accepts\nthe concurrent validity of an omniscient God and human free\nchoice.\n\nNot unrelated to this antinomy is the theological problem posed by the\nhuman capacity for voluntary action. Maimonides stated the difficulty\nas follows: \u201cHow is it possible that a person can do whatever he\npleases?\u2026 How can anything be done in the world without the\npermission and will of its Creator?\u201d (Hilkhot Teshuvah\n5:4). Maimonides\u2019 solution was to define human choice as one\nexpression of the divine will, which is the cause of everything that\ntakes place in the world; accordingly, God \u201cdesired man to have\nhis own free will\u201d (ibid.). Kaspi goes further,\nhowever, suggesting the radical view that God is \u201cthe remote\nmover,\u201d even when a person chooses to realize his free will by\nsinning and worshiping idols; it was in that sense that the Bible\ndescribed God as hardening Pharaoh\u2019s heart (Matsref\nla-Kesef, pp. 152\u2013153).\n\nKaspi provides his readers with guidelines for a virtuous life. As a\nrationalist through and through, he recommends that a person acquire\nthe best possible education. Every effort should be made to accumulate\nthe financial resources necessary to improve one\u2019s education, by\npurchasing books and hiring teachers. Every man should set up a\nfamily: His wife will support him, and his children will keep him in\nhis old age, \u201cso that he should have time to acquire\nwisdom\u2026 Moreover, his sons, if they are good, will join him in\nhis studies, all the more so if his eyes have become dimmed with\nage\u201d (Commentary on Proverbs, pp. 59\u201360). This is a wholly\nutilitarian and egoistical philosophy, recommending the\nself-realization of every human being. Kaspi enunciates these\nguidelines in the context of his scriptural exegesis, relying\nprimarily on the literature of wisdom written, according to Jewish\ntradition, by King Solomon, the wisest of men. He also derives his\nrules from biblical stories, citing their heroes\u2019 behavior.\n\nKaspi\u2019s elitist principles, which create a disparity between the\nwise and the masses, also imply a similarity between humans and other\ncreatures One application of this thesis may be found in his\ncommentary on Isaiah 41:14, referring to the phrase \u201cworm of\nJacob\u201d:\n\nFor we are of the genus of the animals, similar to that of the lowest\nof the creeping insects. We are also their equal in every respect,\nunless we realize the potential of our intellect. All that is\u2026\nso that we should be aroused to acquire intelligence and the\nintelligibles, for in them we differ from the worms\u2026 (Adnei\nKesef, p. 151).\n\n\nIn this context, Kaspi expressed compassion for animals, a tendency\ntoward vegetarianism and a profound disapproval of sacrifices. He even\nexpresses disapproval of Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his\nson.\n6. Conclusion\n\nIf medieval philosophy from Philo to Spinoza may be understood as\nbeing at the service of biblical exegesis, Joseph ibn Kaspi may\ncertainly be viewed as one of its most successful representatives. As\nalready mentioned, he also anticipated some of Spinoza\u2019s\ncontroversial ideas in some contexts. In addition, both Kaspi and\nSpinoza held that only man is capable of loving God, whereas God does\nnot love man (Kaspi, Commentary on Isaiah, p. 151; Spinoza,\nEthics, On the Ability of the Intellect, Theorem\n17).\n\nDespite his brilliance and original thought, Kaspi has never been\nconsidered one of the most important medieval Jewish thinkers or\ncommentators. Only in the 19th century were some of his works\npublished for the first time, and others have yet to see the light of\nday. There are several possible explanations for this. Perhaps his\ncontroversial ideas weighed against his acceptance in the surrounding\nsociety. Another explanation is implied by comparing Kaspi and his\nmore famous contemporary, Gersonides, a biblical exegete and\nphilosopher. Gersonides, despite his non-conservative ideas, earned\nconsiderable fame among Jewish and non-Jewish thinkers. This was\nprimarily thanks to his systematic, profound, philosophical work\nMil\u1e25amot Adonay, which placed him squarely in the realm\nof philosophy, while his Bible commentaries were written mostly in the\nspirit of plain interpretation, although there is much philosophy, as\nwell. Kaspi, however, was something of a philosopher among\ncommentators and a commentator among philosophers; perhaps that was\nwhy he never attained prominence in either group. Kaspi\u2019s\nwritings on logic and Hebrew linguistics were indeed highly creative\nand innovative, but he appeared to have lacked good fortune as far as\npublication is concerned.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Kaspi\u2019s works ", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Kaspi\u2019s works ": ["</h3>\n<ul>", "<em>Adnei Kesef</em> or <em>Sefer ha-Mashal</em>, Commentary on\nthe Prophetic books, ed.
