    "main_text": "Development of Analytic Philosophy in Latin America || Argentina (1940\u20131990)\n2.1 Argentina (1940\u20131990)\n\nAnalytic philosophy appeared in Argentina in the mid-forties in\nsmall discussion groups outside the universities. In the mid-fifties,\nit entered the universities and academic institutions in two different\nareas almost simultaneously. On the one hand, mathematicians and\nphysicists interested in the foundations of mathematics and the\nnatural sciences introduced the logical developments of the early\ntwentieth century and the ideas of the logical positivists of the\nVienna Circle. On the other hand, lawyers and experts in the\nfoundations of law introduced formal developments and analytic tools\nfrom ordinary language philosophy in their studies of legal language.\nThose groups were connected from the beginning. During the 1960s and\n1970s, the country faced a serious political crisis that compelled\nmany philosophers to either leave the country or develop their\nactivities within a new private institution (SADAF). With the recovery\nof democracy in the 1980s, analytic philosophy returned to the\nuniversities and other public institutions. It was in the 1980s that\nthe first Argentinian journal devoted to analytic philosophy appeared.\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the overall quality and originality of\nphilosophical output increased, and analytic philosophy was settled\nacross the country.\n\nThe early reception of analytic philosophy took place from the\nmid-1940s to the mid-1950s. In 1944, Mario Bunge founded\nMinerva, probably the first philosophy journal exclusively\ndevoted to philosophy in Latin America (Mart\u00ed 1998;\nSalmer\u00f3n 1991a). In subsequent years, analytic philosophy was\nalso studied in various reading groups that gathered both supporters\nand critics of analytic philosophy. From 1945 onwards, the members of\nthe Grupo Argentino de la Academia Internacional de Historia y\nFilosof\u00eda de la Ciencia discussed Russell and Carnap\n(Rabossi 1984). In 1952, two new groups emerged: a group hosted by the\nInstituto Libre de Estudios Superiores interested in logic\nand philosophy of science and the C\u00edrculo Filos\u00f3fico\nde Buenos Aires led by Bunge. The creation of these two new\ngroups indicates the presence of a growing community of people\ninterested in philosophical analysis. It was in the\nC\u00edrculo that they discussed a manuscript of\nBunge\u2019s Causality: The Place of the Causal Principle in\nModern Science\u2014one of the first and most significant\nanalytic works published by a Latin American philosopher.\n\nA few years later, analytic philosophy formally entered various\nuniversities and other public institutions. In 1954, Carlos Cossio\norganized a seminar on von Wright\u2019s An Essay in Modal\nLogic in the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences at the\nUniversidad de Buenos Aires. Familiarity with Tarski\u2019s\nIntroduction to Logic and the Methodology of Deductive\nSciences was a requirement for attending that seminar (Rabossi\n1984). In 1956, Bunge took up the chair in philosophy of science in\nthe Philosophy Department at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. In 1957,\nGregorio Klimovsky took up the chair in logic.\n\nDuring his almost ten years at the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Bunge\nexerted firm opposition to the metaphysical trends emanating from\nEuropean philosophy and created Cuadernos de\nEpistemolog\u00eda, a collection of translations of important\narticles for students (Rabossi 1984). He also published\nAntolog\u00eda sem\u00e1ntica, a comprehensive collection\nof translations into Spanish of seminal texts from the analytic canon.\nIn 1965, Bunge decided to pursue his career abroad. Nevertheless, his\nmore than twenty years of intellectual activity in Argentina were key\nto the development of analytic philosophy in the country (for further\ninformation about Bunge\u2019s role in Latin American philosophy of\nscience, see the entry\n Philosophy of Science in Latin America).\n\nKlimovsky introduced axiomatic set theory and the debates concerning\nthe foundations of mathematics. Though Klimovsky published few papers,\nhis deep knowledge and enthusiasm for logic, the foundations of\nmathematics, the methodology of natural sciences, the foundations of\npsychoanalysis, and the history of science left a deep impression on\nhis\n students.[4]\n Some of them became the first generation of Argentinian analytic\nphilosophers. Two of them were crucial for the development of analytic\nphilosophy in the country: Thomas Moro Simpson and F\u00e9lix\nSchuster.\n\nSimpson introduced philosophy of language as a discipline in\nArgentina. He published Formas l\u00f3gicas, realidad y\nsignificado (1964), a very influential book in Latin America.\nIndeed, Simpson taught that material at the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas (IIFs) in Mexico in 1967 and\nthe book was translated into Portuguese in\n 1976.[5]\n In 1973, he published Sem\u00e1ntica filos\u00f3fica\n(1973), an anthology of translations of seminal works from the\nanalytic canon. Simpson\u2019s students Ra\u00fal Orayen and\nAlberto Moretti worked on logic, philosophy of logic, and philosophy\nof language. Orayen focused on the philosophy of logic and language,\naddressing problems raised by Russell, Frege, Quine, and Kripke. He is\nbest known for his formulation of \u201cOrayen\u2019s\nparadox\u201d, a paradox that arises when one tries to formulate a\nmodel that captures the intended interpretation of the language for\nset\n theory.[6]\n He worked in Argentina until the late 1970s and joined IIFs in 1982.\nOnce in Mexico, Orayen trained several analytic philosophers and wrote\nhis most significant contributions. The works from that period were\ncollected in L\u00f3gica, significado y ontolog\u00eda\n (1989).[7]\n Moretti specialized in Frege and studied Davidson\u2019s philosophy\nof language and Tarski\u2019s theory of truth. He developed a view of\nlogic as a condition of possibility of language, reality, and thought.\nSome of his most significant contributions are collected in\nInterpretar y referir. Ejercicios de an\u00e1lisis\nfilos\u00f3fico (2008) and En sayos anal\u00edticos\n(2021).\n\nSchuster made significant contributions to social philosophy. His book\nExplicaci\u00f3n y predicci\u00f3n: La validez del\nconocimiento en ciencias sociales (1982) is considered a classic\nand has been reprinted numerous times. It examines the structure,\nmethodology, and predictive power of theories in the social\n sciences.[8]\n[9]\n\nAs indicated above, Cossio from the Faculty of Law at the Universidad\nde Buenos Aires had organized a seminar on modal logic in 1954. In the\nfollowing years, he and his successor, Ambrosio Gioja continued those\n developments.[10]\n Some of their students became the founders of the analytic tradition\nin the\n country.[11]\n Particularly relevant are Genaro\n Carri\u00f3[12]\n and Eduardo Rabossi, who were interested in the analysis of ordinary\nlanguage. Rabossi had wide-ranging interests. In An\u00e1lisis\nfilos\u00f3fico, lenguaje y metaf\u00edsica (1975), he\nintroduced basic ideas from the analytic tradition into the\nSpanish-speaking world. In ethics, his most influential book is La\njustificaci\u00f3n moral del castigo (1976). One of his most\nimportant works, En el comienzo Dios cre\u00f3 el canon,\nwas published posthumously (2008) (See\n Section 3.3).[13]\n\nAmong the first analytic philosophers trained in law school, there was\nan alternative approach that applied formal tools to elucidate the\nlanguage of law. Especially noteworthy is Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n and\nEugenio Bulygin\u2019s Normative Systems (1971), a\npioneering book on deontic logic. The authors presented legal systems\nas deductive systems and studied the logical asymmetries between the\nprocesses of promulgation and abolition of\n laws.[14]\n Alchourr\u00f3n\u2019s aim was to develop a formal system that\navoided the introduction of inconsistencies in legal bodies. The\nanalogy with belief systems led him to focus on belief change,\nproducing the first formal paper on the dynamics of belief\n(Alchourr\u00f3n et al. 1985). The theory, known as AGM (by the\ninitials of the last names of its creators: Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n,\nPeter G\u00e4rdenfors, and David Makinson), has had a major impact\nworldwide (for a presentation of Alchourr\u00f3n and\ncollaborators\u2019 work, see Arl\u00f3-Costa and Ferm\u00e9\n(2009) and the entry\n Logic of Belief Revision).[15]\n\nOne of the youngest members of this generation, Carlos Nino, played an\ninfluential role in both philosophy and the institutional history of\nArgentina. He made contributions to ethics, philosophy of law, and\nconstitutional\n theory.[16]\n Nino is also remembered for his political commitment to the recovery\nof democracy in Argentina in the 1980s\n (Section 3.2\n introduces Nino\u2019s work).\n\nFrom the late 1960s to the 1970s, Argentina was hit by a political\ncrisis. In 1966, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that led to a\nmilitary intervention in the universities compelled many philosophers\nto resign their positions. Some emigrated to other countries, others\nleft the country for a couple of years, and still others tried to find\nan alternative way of doing philosophy. Thus, shortly after, various\nphilosophers started to gather outside official circles in order to\ncontinue their philosophical work. In 1972, they created SADAF\n(Sociedad Argentina de An\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico), an\nassociation analogous to the Aristotelian Society that\ninitially organized talks and seminars (Rabossi\n 1984).[17]\n In hindsight, SADAF made it possible to establish a unified community\nof analytic philosophers. In addition to maintaining the spirit and\npractice of analytic philosophy during the years in which it was\nexcluded from the public sphere (1966\u20131983), SADAF and its\nmembers carried out three major tasks: 1) they trained young\ngenerations within the analytic tradition; 2) they strengthened their\nconnections with analytic communities from other countries, mostly\nIIFs in Mexico and the Centro de l\u00f3gica,\nepistemolog\u00eda e hist\u00f3ria da ci\u00eancia in\nBrazil; and 3) they created, in 1981, An\u00e1lisis\nFilos\u00f3fico, the first journal exclusively devoted to\nanalytic philosophy in Argentina and the second one in Latin\n America.[18]\n\nAlthough analytic philosophy has developed for the most part in Buenos\nAires, there has been work in analytic philosophy in other cities\nsince the 1960s.\n\nIn C\u00f3rdoba, Andr\u00e9s Raggio was appointed chair of logic\n(1956) and then of philosophy of science at the Universidad Nacional\nde C\u00f3rdoba. Ernesto Garz\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s was hired the\nsame year as a researcher at the Instituto de Filosof\u00eda del\nDerecho at the same university. The political crisis compelled\nthem to leave the country in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, Alberto\nMoreno and Rabossi helped develop analytic philosophy of language and\nmind. Their student Carolina Scotto is nowadays the most established\nresearcher in those two\n areas.[19]\n She has also managed to build a solid research group that has made\ncontributions to those areas. From the early 1980s to the 1990s,\nHoracio Faas focused on logic. During that same period, V\u00edctor\nRodr\u00edguez worked in philosophy of science. For more than twenty\nyears, Rodr\u00edguez has organized the Jornadas de\nEpistemolog\u00eda e Historia de la Ciencia, an annual meeting\nopen to analytic philosophy.\n\nIn the 1960s, Roberto Rojo introduced the works of Carnap,\nWittgenstein, and Quine at the Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n\n(Rabossi 1984).\n\nIn the early 1970s, research in logic developed at the Universidad\nNacional de La Plata with Carlos Lungarzo and Gladys Palau.\nUnfortunately, both were compelled to resign in 1975. Nevertheless,\nanalytic philosophy returned to the university after the recovery of\ndemocracy in 1983.\n\nDespite the political and economic crisis, analytic philosophy started\nto thrive in Argentina in the 1970s and it was firmly established by\nthe late 1980s. After the recovery of democracy in 1983, most of\nSADAF\u2019s founders returned to the Universidad de Buenos Aires,\nwhere they found younger generations of students eager to be trained\nin the analytic tradition. This first generation of analytic\nphilosophers mentored most analytic philosophers currently working in\nArgentina and many Argentinian philosophers who have pursued their\ncareers abroad. Their influence also spread to other parts of the\ncountry through the national university\n system.[20]\n",
