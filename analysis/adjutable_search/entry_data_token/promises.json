It is in part this fixed\nplace in our intuitive judgments that makes promises of particular\ninterest to philosophers, as well as a host of social scientists and\nother theorists.\n\nAnother feature of promises that make them a topic of philosophical\nconcern is their role in producing trust, and by so doing facilitating\nsocial coordination and cooperation. Because of this promises and\nrelated phenomena, such as vows, oaths, pledges, contracts, treaties\nand agreements more generally are important elements of justice and\nthe law, and, at least in the Social Contract tradition, of the\npolitical order as well.\n\nPromises are of special interest to ethical theorists, as they are\ngenerally taken to impose moral obligations. Thus an explanation of\nhow such promissory obligations come about and how they function is\nnecessary for a complete moral theory.\n\nAnd if indeed promises produce moral obligations, they are of a\npeculiar sort. Unlike paradigmatic moral duties, the duty not to harm\nfor example, promissory obligations are not owed equally to everyone,\nbut rather only those we have promised. Further, promissory\nobligations are voluntary; we don\u2019t have to make promises, but\nwe must keep them when we do.\n\nAnd promissory obligations aren\u2019t just contingent upon acts of\nthe will, like the obligations we might incur by deliberately damaging\nsomeone\u2019s property, but (at least it seems on first reflection)\nthey are immediately created by acts of the will. When I\npromise to do something, it seems that by so doing I have\ncreated the obligation to do it.\n\nThis last feature makes promissory obligations a special puzzle for\nethical theories. The idea that we simply manufacture promissory\nobligations by speaking them, like an incantation, is decidedly\nmysterious. As Hume acidly remarked in the Treatise\n(1739\u201340):\n\n\nI shall further observe, that, since every new promise imposes a new\nobligation of morality on the person who promises, and since this new\nobligation arises from his will; it is one of the most mysterious and\nincomprehensible operations that can possibly be imagined, and may\neven be compared to transubstantiation or holy\norders, where a certain form of words, along with a certain\nintention, changes entirely the nature of an external object, and even\nof a human creature. (Treatise, 3.2.5; emphasis in the\noriginal)\n\n\nThe philosophical work on these topics is body of literature that\nspans the ages. Although promising as a phenomenon is rarely the sole\nsubject of a major work, it is a subject treated by many major\nfigures. From the ancients to the medievals to the moderns and beyond,\ntheorists have sought to explain the normative force of promises.\nWhile the bulk of the corpus is in ethical and political theory and\nthe related fields of legal theory and applied ethics, work on\npromises has also been done in the philosophy of language, action\ntheory, rationality theory, game theory and other areas.\n\nThere are a variety of methods of classifying promissory theories in\nthe literature. Atiyah (1981), Downie (1985), Vitek (1993), Shiffrin\n(2008), Owens (2012), van Roojen (2013), Liberto (2016b), and many\nothers have given the matter some attention, and while there is\nsignificant overlap, there are some differences as well. Typically\ntheorists sort theories by reference to the way in which promissory\nobligations are generated. On this standard taxonomy the main types of\npromissory theory are: Normative power views, Conventionalist views,\nExpectation views, and Joint Commitment views\n", "toc": [{"#NormPoweTheo": "1.

Normative Power Theory\n\nOn these theories promising is a special sort of power we have over\nour normative circumstances, the power to invoke obligations by\npromissory utterance. What separates this approach from the others is\nthe self-contained nature of promises: promisors obligate themselves\ndirectly, by their own powers, rather than indirectly, either by\nappeal to a convention or by engendering expectations or commitments\nin the promisee.\n\nTraditional normative power views, like the one Hume is mocking in the\nquote above, ground such a power in one of the various traditions that\ngo under the general title \u201cNatural Law\u201d, like the\nvirtue-based views of the ancients and the divinity-based views of the\nmedieval theologians. Modern (in the philosophical sense) normative\npower views generally ground the power in the rights or interests of\npromisors.\n1.1 Ancient Views\n\nRepresentative of the ancient view, for Aristotle promise-keeping is\ndirectly mandated by the virtues, in particular those of justice, as\nwell as liberality in cases of purely gratuitous promises:\n\n\nLet us discuss them both, but first of all the truthful man. We are\nnot speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements, i.e., in\nthe things that pertain to justice or injustice (for this would belong\nto another excellence[this would be the virtue of justice]), but the\nman who in the matters in which nothing of this sort is at stake is\ntrue both in word and in life because his character is such. But such\na man would seem to be as a matter of fact equitable. For the man who\nloves truth, and is truthful where nothing is at stake, will still\nmore be truthful where something is at stake; he will avoid falsehood\nas something base, seeing that he avoided it even for its own sake;\nand such a man is worthy of praise. He inclines rather to understate\nthe truth; for this seems in better taste because exaggerations are\nwearisome. (Nicomachean Ethics, iv. vii,\n1127a\u20131127b)\n\n\nThe Roman Jurists like Cicero and Gaius developed this sort of view\nfurther, crucially conceiving of a specific moral duty to keep\npromises, and a specific (and for Cicero particularly Roman)\nvirtue of fidelity to promises (see Cicero, De Officiis 1.8)\nas well as formalizing promissory obligations, by reference to a\nspecific procedure called the stipulatio or stipulating:\n\n\nA verbal obligation is created by question and answer in such form as:\n\u201cDo you solemnly promise conveyance? I solemnly promise\nconveyance\u201d; \u201cWill you convey? I will convey\u201d;\n\u201cDo you promise? I promise\u201d; \u201cDo you promise on your\nhonour? I promise on my honour\u201d; \u201cDo you guarantee on your\nhonour? I guarantee on my honour\u201d; \u201cWill you do? I will\ndo\u201d (Gaius, Inst. 3.92, cited in Swain 2013)\n\n1.2 Natural Law Views\n\nAnd the tradition is also later enlarged by Scholastic theorists, most\nimportantly Aquinas (Aquinas, Summa Theologica II, q.88 &\nq.110). Aquinas used Aristotelian assumptions and techniques to expand\nand detail the theory, deriving the duty to keep a promise from the\nintentions of the promisor and the underpinning virtues (see Gordley\n1991: 10ff).\n\nAquinas discusses promises indirectly, in his treatment of vows, which\nhe takes are promises made to God. His adaptation of Aristotelian\nvirtue theory to the precepts of the natural law made for some\nimportant changes in the theory\u2014principally a shift in focus to\nthe will of the promisor as the agent of obligation. For Aquinas, a\npromise is essentially the agent\u00a0\u201cbinding\u201d himself\n(i.e., generating an obligation) by act of will:\n\n\nA vow denotes a binding to do or omit some particular thing. Now one\nman binds himself to another by means of a promise, which is an act of\nthe reason to which faculty it belongs to direct. For just as a man by\ncommanding or praying, directs, in a fashion, what others are to do\nfor him, so by promising he directs what he himself is to do for\nanother. [\u2026] Now a promise is the outcome from a purpose of\ndoing something: and a purpose presupposes deliberation, since it is\nthe act of a deliberate will. Accordingly three things are essential\nto a vow: the first is deliberation; the second is a purpose of the\nwill; and the third is a promise, wherein is completed the nature of a\nvow. Sometimes, however, two other things are added as a sort of\nconfirmation of the vow, namely, pronouncement by word of mouth,\naccording to Psalm 65:13, \u201cI will pay Thee my vows which my lips\nhave uttered\u201d; and the witnessing of others. Hence the Master\nsays (Sent. iv, D, 38) that a vow is \u201cthe witnessing of a\nspontaneous promise and ought to be made to God and about things\nrelating to God\u201d: although the \u201cwitnessing\u201d may\nstrictly refer to the inward protestation. (Summa, II-II,\nq.88)\n\n\nStill later on, important early modern commentators on promising in\nthe Natural Law tradition such as Locke (1689, Two Treatises On\nGovernment, II-II:14), Reid (1788, Essay on the Active Powers\nof Man, 2), Grotius (1625, De iure naturae, ii. xi.),\nPufendorf (1672, De iure naturae et gentium, iii. v. 9),\nStair (1681/93, Institutions of the Laws of Scotland, I.\nX.1), and others developed the doctrine in new directions.\n\nThis natural law tradition waned in popularity among philosophers\nduring the modern period, with influential early theorists like Hobbes\nand Hume adopting conventionalist sorts of views. This is of a piece\nwith the turn to more naturalistic views in many different areas of\nwestern philosophy, but the tradition never disappeared. Through the\nworks of later natural lawyers in Spain and elsewhere, (Suarez,\nMolina), the tradition greatly influenced the development of European\nprivate law doctrine\u2014the doctrine underlying things like\ncontract and tort law. See the section below on the\n relationship between promissory theory and contract law\n for more. For an excellent overview of these issues, see chapter 1 of\nJames Gordley\u2019s The Philosophical Origins of Modern Contract\nDoctrine (1991).\n1.3 Contemporary Views\n\nBy the twentieth century newer versions of normative power views began\nto appear. Unsurprisingly, these neo-normative power views were\ninitially most popular among theorists with a significant legal theory\nbent, e.g., H. L. A. Hart (1955) and Joseph Raz (1972, 1977, 1984,\n2012). But philosophers without any such link have also adopted them,\nsome examples being Gary Watson (2004)\u00a0and David Owens (2006,\n2008, 2012). \u00a0\n\nThe new normative power views generally ground the power the same way\nother elements of Hohfeldian (1919) systems (e.g., rights and\nprivileges) have been grounded, by appeal to our interests (see\nFeinberg 1970). Perhaps the paradigm of such a view is HLA\nHart\u2019s appeal in his seminal \u201cAre There Any Natural\nRights?\u201d (Hart 1955), where he makes promissory obligations out\nto rest on \u201cspecial rights\u201d generated by the parties, in\nthe interests of \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d:\n\n\nWhen rights arise out of special transactions between individuals or\nout of some special relationship in which they stand to each other,\nboth the persons who have the right and those who have the\ncorresponding obligation are limited to the parties to the special\ntransaction or relationship. [\u2026]\n\n(i) The most obvious cases of special rights are those that arise from\npromises. By promising to do or not to do something, we voluntarily\nincur obligations and create or confer rights on those to whom we\npromise; we alter the existing moral independence of the\nparties\u2019 freedom of choice in relation to some action and create\na new moral relationship between them, so that it becomes morally\nlegitimate for the person to whom the promise is given to determine\nhow the promisor shall act. That which corresponds very well to the\ndistinction between a right, which an individual has, and what it is\nright to do. The promisee has a temporary authority or sovereignty in\nrelation to some specific matter over the other\u2019s will which we\nexpress by saying that the promisor is under an obligation to the\npromisee to do what he has promised. To some philosophers the notion\nthat moral phenomena\u2014rights and duties or obligations\u2014can\nbe brought into existence by the voluntary action of individuals has\nappeared utterly mysterious; but this I think has been so because they\nhave not clearly seen how special the moral notions of a right and an\nobligation are, nor how peculiarly they are connected with the\ndistribution of freedom of choice [\u2026] (Hart 1955:\n183\u2013184)\n\n\nHart\u2019s proposal was the harbinger of a revival of these sorts of\ntheories, first among legal theorists and then to moral philosophers\nmore generally. One of the earliest and most influential authors to\ntake up Hart\u2019s idea is Joseph Raz. First appearing in his 1977\nessay \u201cPromises and Obligations\u201d (Raz 1977) and later in\nhis book The Morality of Freedom (1986) and elsewhere (see\nRaz 1982, 2014) Raz advances a normative power view that explicitly\ngrounds the promissory power in our interests in self-binding for\ncooperation and coordination:\n\n\nNormative powers are the abilities of people (or institutions) to\nchange normative situations or conditions (i.e., to impose or repeal\nduties, to confer or revoke rights, to change status etc.) by acts\nintended to achieve these changes, where the ability depends on\n(namely is based on, grounded on, justified by) the desirability (the\nvalue) of those people (or institutions) having them.\n\nIn the case of promises the value of the power is that it expands\npeople\u2019s ability to fashion their lives, or aspects of their\nlives, by their actions. Through their promises they commit themselves\nto others. Up to a point, promises are analogous to decisions that\nconstitute reasons for the deciders to perform the act they decided to\nperform. Both are ways of opening up options through closing other\noptions, normatively speaking. Decisions, as well as having goals,\nfacilitate undertaking complex activities (giving a ball, writing a\nsymphony, etc.) that require concerted actions. Promises, being\ncommitments to others, facilitate co-operation, the forging of\nrelations that presuppose dependence, trust and joint actions, and\nmore. For the sake of brevity I will refer to the value of having\nthese powers as the value of enhanced control (of one\u2019s life),\nthough a somewhat different explanation of their value is required\nwhen the powers are held by institutions. (Raz 2014: 61)\n\n\nDavid Owens (2006, 2008, 2011, 2012), in a recent and widely\ninfluential approach, proposes a power based in what he calls our\n\u201cauthority interest\u201d, or the interest we have in having a\ncertain practical authority over others, the authority that being the\nrecipient of a promise gives us. This power is one of a family of such\npowers, whose purpose is to serve our interest in being able to shape\nthe normative landscape by declaration, an interest that takes at\nleast two forms: the authority interest, which underwrites\npromissory obligation and the permissive interest that\nunderwrites the power of consent:\n\n\nI shall argue that promising exists because, at least when it comes to\neach other\u2019s actions, human beings often have what might be\ncalled an authority interest: I often want it to be the case that I,\nrather than you, have the authority to determine what you do. If you\npromise me a lift home, this promise gives me the right to require you\nto drive me home; in that sense, it puts me in authority over you. So\nmuch is obvious. What I claim is that human beings often want such\nauthority for its own sake (not just to facilitate prediction or\ncoordination). I often have an interest in having the right to\ndetermine whether you\u2019ll give me a lift, over and above any\ninterest I have in knowing what you (or we) will actually do. And I\nclaim that promising exists because it serves this authority interest.\n(Owens, 2006: 51)\n\n\nSeana Shiffrin (2008, 2012b) has also recently proposed a novel\nnormative power view, one that grounds the power in our interests in\nforming and maintaining relationships with others, rather than\nauthority or coordination. On Shiffrin\u2019s view promises are of a\npiece with other commitments that are integral to the structure of\nintimate relations between persons:\n\n\n[\u2026]The power to make binding promises, as well as to forge a\nvariety of other related forms of commitment, is an integral part of\nthe ability to engage in special relationships in a morally good way,\nunder conditions of equal respect. (Shiffrin 2008: 485)\n\n\nThese recent developments have spawned a burgeoning literature, with a\nfocus on the issue of normative powers themselves, e.g., Chang (2013,\n2020), Westlund (2013, 2018), Nieswandt (2017), as well as their\npropriety for explaining promissory obligation, e.g., E. Taylor\n(2013), Fruh (2014, 2019), Molina (2019), Melenovsky (2017) and\nothers.\n2. Conventionalism\n\nConventionalism about promises refers, in the vaguest sense, to views\nthat invoke the promising convention (or the promising\n\u201cpractice\u201d, \u201cinstitution\u201d,\n\u201csystem\u201d, or \u201cgame\u201d to mention some of the\nother names that it goes by in the literature) as central to their\nexplanation of the provenance of promises and promissory\nobligations.\n\nThere are a number of different ways of making this idea more precise\nin the literature (E. Taylor 2013, Neiwenstadt 2019a, van Roojen 2020,\nCohon 2021, inter alia). My survey of this literature leads\nto me to propose a distinction between two sorts of conventionalism,\nontological and normative.\n2.1 Ontological and Normative Conventionalism\n\nThe first of these, ontological conventionalism, is the idea that\npromises are ontologically dependent upon the convention, so that\npromises could not exist, or could not be properly understood as\npromises, without the promising convention. One way of understanding\nthis is via the framework found in Rawls\u2019 1955 article Two\nConcepts of Rules.\n\nRawls distinguished between what he called the \u201csummary\u201d\nconception of rules, in which rules are merely \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d, i.e., guides to established actions\u2014like the rules\nof effective writing, and the \u201cpractice\u201d view of rules,\nwhere the rules define a practice, which in turn defines the actions\nregulated by the rules. Rawls calls these latter sort\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d rules.\n\nConstitutive rules, like the rules of baseball, are necessary for us\nto perform (and even understand) game-based actions like\n\u201cstriking out\u201d or \u201chitting a home run\u201d (Rawls\n1955). So on views that are ontologically conventionalist, promises\nare like home runs, i.e., they are only intelligible within the bounds\nof the convention\u2014they are artefacts of it.\n\nThe second thing meant by the term \u201cconventionalist\u201d is\nwhat I call Normative Conventionalism. This is the idea that the\nconvention explains the normative force of the promissory obligation,\nin a particular way. On these views individual promises are obligatory\nbecause of some prior obligation to the convention or its members as\nsuch.\n\nThis appeal can be made in different ways, by pointing to different\nelements of the convention and the ways in which reneging might affect\nit. One standard way is to argue for a duty to uphold the convention,\non some basis, as well as an appeal to the damage one might do to the\nconvention by reneging.\n\nThe two qualities go naturally together, and many contemporary\ntheories make both claims, although they are sometimes not careful to\ndistinguish them. But they are independent qualities, and they can and\ndo come apart. This can be seen by considering two early\nconventionalist theories, those of Hobbes and Hume.\n\nHobbes thinks that keeping promises is only rational (and thus\npromises are obligatory) due to the fear of punishment for reneging,\npunishment that only follows from the establishment of the civil state\nand a system of promissory exchange backed by the power of that\nstate:\n\n\nCovenants Of Mutuall Trust, When Invalid\n\nIf a Covenant be made, wherein neither of the parties performe\npresently, but trust one another; in the condition of meer Nature,\n(which is a condition of Warre of every man against every man,) upon\nany reasonable suspition, it is Voyd; But if there be a common Power\nset over them bothe, with right and force sufficient to compell\nperformance; it is not Voyd. For he that performeth first, has no\nassurance the other will performe after; because the bonds of words\nare too weak to bridle mens ambition, avarice, anger, and other\nPassions, without the feare of some coerceive Power; which in the\ncondition of meer Nature, where all men are equall, and judges of the\njustnesse of their own fears cannot possibly be supposed. And\ntherefore he which performeth first, does but betray himselfe to his\nenemy; contrary to the Right (he can never abandon) of defending his\nlife, and means of living.\n\nBut in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain\nthose that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more\nreasonable; and for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform\nfirst, is obliged so to do.\n\nThe cause of Feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be\nalwayes something arising after the Covenant made; as some new fact,\nor other signe of the Will not to performe; else it cannot make the\nCovenant Voyd. For that which could not hinder a man from promising,\nought not to be admitted as a hindrance of performing.\n\n\nBut Hobbes also thinks that promises, and their cognates, exchanges,\nagreements and covenants and contracts, arise not from any convention,\nbut rather from our power to transfer innate rights we have to each\nother:\n\n\nRenouncing (or) Transferring Right What; Obligation Duty Injustice\n\nRight is layd aside, either by simply Renouncing it; or by\nTransferring it to another. By Simply RENOUNCING; when he cares not to\nwhom the benefit thereof redoundeth. By TRANSFERRING; when he\nintendeth the benefit thereof to some certain person, or persons. And\nwhen a man hath in either manner abandoned, or granted away his Right;\nthen is he said to be OBLIGED, or BOUND, not to hinder those, to whom\nsuch Right is granted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that\nhe Ought, and it his DUTY, not to make voyd that voluntary act of his\nown: and that such hindrance is INJUSTICE, and INJURY, as being Sine\nJure; the Right being before renounced, or transferred. So that\nInjury, or Injustice, in the controversies of the world, is somewhat\nlike to that, which in the disputations of Scholers is called\nAbsurdity. For as it is there called an Absurdity, to contradict what\none maintained in the Beginning: so in the world, it is called\nInjustice, and Injury, voluntarily to undo that, which from the\nbeginning he had voluntarily done. The way by which a man either\nsimply Renounceth, or Transferreth his Right, is a Declaration, or\nSignification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or signes, that\nhe doth so Renounce, or Transferre; or hath so Renounced, or\nTransferred the same, to him that accepteth it. And these Signes are\neither Words onely, or Actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often)\nboth Words and Actions. And the same are the BONDS, by which men are\nbound, and obliged: Bonds, that have their strength, not from their\nown Nature, (for nothing is more easily broken then a mans word,) but\nfrom Feare of some evill consequence upon the rupture.\n\n\nThe distinction helps us perhaps understand a bit better the obvious\ntension between these two claims on Hobbes\u2019 part. How is it that\nHobbes can say that promises and contracts are matters of the will, in\none section, but then null and void in the state of nature in the\nsubsequent? Because in the first gloss Hobbes is saying what a promise\nis, ontologically speaking, and in the second he is speaking of what\ngenerates its normative force.\n\nSo Hobbes\u2019 theory is normatively, but not ontologically,\nconventionalist. He takes it that the normative force of a promise\nflows from the convention, while the promise itself is created by an\nact of the will in transfer of rights.\n\nFor Hume, the reverse is true. Hume thinks that promises are\nconventional in the ontological sense\u2014they are artefacts of a\nhuman convention, and fidelity, the virtue of justice that attend\nthem, is also artificial for this reason. This he contrasts with\nother, natural virtues, like caring for offspring, which are\ninnate.\n\n\nI say, first, that a promise is not intelligible naturally, nor\nantecedent to human conventions; and that a man, unacquainted with\nsociety, could never enter into any engagements with another, even\nthough they could perceive each other\u2019s thoughts by intuition.\n[\u2026]\n\nNow it is evident we have no motive leading us to the performance of\npromises, distinct from a sense of duty. If we thought, that promises\nhad no moral obligation, we never should feel any inclination to\nobserve them. This is not the case with the natural virtues. Though\nthere was no obligation to relieve the miserable, our humanity would\nlead us to it; and when we omit that duty, the immorality of the\nomission arises from its being a proof, that we want the natural\nsentiments of humanity. A father knows it to be his duty to take care\nof his children: But he has also a natural inclination to it. And if\nno human creature had that indication, no one could lie under any such\nobligation. (Treatise, 3.2.5)\n\n\nBut Hume also thinks that the primary role of the convention in\nproducing individual promissory obligations is indirect. Hume takes it\nthat the appreciation of the convention produces in people both the\nsentiments themselves that are, for Hume, the mark of the moral, as\nwell as the dispositions to foster and encourage those sentiments in\nthemselves and others:\n\n\nThere needs but a very little practice of the world, to make us\nperceive all these consequences and advantages. The shortest\nexperience of society discovers them to every mortal; and when each\nindividual perceives the same sense of interest in all his fellows, he\nimmediately performs his part of any contract, as being assured, that\nthey will not be wanting in theirs. All of them, by concert, enter\ninto a scheme of actions, calculated for common benefit, and agree to\nbe true to their word; nor is there any thing requisite to form this\nconcert or convention, but that every one have a sense of interest in\nthe faithful fulfilling of engagements, and express that sense to\nother members of the society. This immediately causes that interest to\noperate upon them; and interest is the first obligation to the\nperformance of promises.\n\nAfterwards a sentiment of morals concurs with interest, and becomes a\nnew obligation upon mankind. This sentiment of morality, in the\nperformance of promises, arises from the same principles as that in\nthe abstinence from the property of others. Public interest,\neducation, and the artifices of politicians, have the same effect in\nboth cases. The difficulties, that occur to us, in supposing a moral\nobligation to attend promises, we either surmount or elude.\n(Treatise, 3.2.5)\n\n\nSo Hume\u2019s promissory theory is ontologically conventionalist,\nbut not normatively so. Rather promises are obligatory by way of the\nmoral sentiments, like all other moral obligations. This point is\nelegantly made in a recent piece, \u201cHume\u2019s Practice Theory\nand its Dissimilar Descendants\u201d (Cohon 2021)\n2.2 Paradigmatic Conventionalism\n\nPerhaps a better way of understanding contemporary conventionalist\ntheories is that they are paradigmatically both normatively and\nontologically conventional about promises. Such a theory is offered by\nJohn Rawls, in his seminal A Theory of Justice (1971).\n\nRawls conceives of promises not as sui generis moral actions,\nbut as essentially institutional artifacts, and thus promissory\nobligations as institutional obligations, grounded in the same manner\nas all such obligations. These institutions are comprised of sets of\nrules that prescribe and proscribe certain sorts of behavior for the\nparticipants in the institution. The dicta of the rules are the\ncontents of moral obligations. Rawls in turn grounds institutional\nobligations in what he calls the principle of fairness.\n\nThe principle of fairness is a basic moral principle, chosen by\ncontractors in the OP. But unlike its more famous Rawlsian cognate the\ndifference principle, the principle of fairness is an individual\nprinciple, one that applies directly to individuals in the society, as\nopposed to the basic institutions of the society themselves. Rawls\nlays out the principle of fairness in the following way:\n\n\n\u2026[A] person is required to do his part as defined by the rules\nof an institution when two conditions are met: first the institution\nis just (or fair)\u2026and second, one has voluntarily accepted the\nbenefits of the arrangement or taken advantage of the opportunities it\noffers to further their own interests. (1971: 111\u2013112)\n\n\nSo there are two conditions on an action\u2019s being an\ninstitutional obligation in the Rawlsian sense: (1) The institution\nwhose rule calls for the action is just, and (2) The person has\n\u201cvoluntarily accepted the benefits\u201d of the\ninstitution.\n\nRawls then introduces three theoretical elements to explain promissory\nobligations in particular. The first is what he calls the rule of\npromising, or the central rule that constitutes the promising\nconvention:\n\n\n[I]f one says the words \u201cI promise to do X\u201d in\nthe appropriate circumstances, one is to do X, unless certain\nexcusing conditions obtain. (Rawls, 1971: 345)\n\n\nRawls doesn\u2019t go into the circumstance and conditions mentioned\nin the rule in any great detail, but he does note that a promise must\nbe voluntary and deliberate. He also notes that a proper rendition of\nsuch clauses is necessary to evaluate whether the institution of\npromising the rule defines is just (1971: 346). The second piece of\ntheory Rawls employs is the notion of a bona fide promise. A bona fide\npromise is a promise that arises in accordance with the rule of\npromising, when the practice [of promising] it represents is just.\n\nAnd the third piece of theory is a moral principle targeted to\npromises directly, what Rawls call the Principle of Fidelity. The\nprinciple of fidelity is merely a derivative of the principle of\nfairness, fashioned specifically for the institution of promising. And\nit says simply that \u201c[B]ona fide promises are to be kept\u201d\n(1971: 347).\n\nThus Rawls\u2019 explanation for the obligatory force of promises is\nroughly: If you make a promise under a just promising institution,\nthen you are obligated to uphold that institution (and obey its rules)\nbecause to do otherwise would be to \u201cfree-ride\u201d on the\ninstitution in a manner forbidden by the principle of fairness.\n\nSo, unlike Hobbes and Hume, for Rawls the convention is both source of\npromises as a phenomenon and the source of the moral justification for\npromissory obligation. Individual promises are \u201cmoves\u201d in\nthe promising game, as home runs are moves in baseball, and promissory\nobligations are grounded in the value of the convention directly.\n\nAnother important contemporary branch of conventionalist theory is\npropounded by John Searle (1965, inter alia) Like Rawls,\nSearle takes promises to be essentially institutional actions, made\npossible by the very rules of the promising convention. Similarly,\npromissory obligations are a kind of institutional obligation, one\nthat attends those already bound by the institution. And ultimately,\nthe normative force of the individual promises is grounded in the\nvalue of the convention as a whole. See the Promises and Speech acts\n (section 6.1)\n below for further information.\n2.3 Hybrid Theories\n\nBy the late twentieth century, outside of the legal academy, this sort\nof dual conventionalism was the dominant view among theorists who took\nup these issues. Thomas Scanlon\u2019s influential work propounding\nan expectational view of promises, takes this tradition as its\ntarget.\n\nIn \u201cPromises and Practices\u201d (1990), Scanlon argued that\n(among other things) the conventional view gets the harm of breaking a\npromise wrong. On the conventional view, when someone breaks a\npromise, they harm the convention of promising as a whole, and by\nextension, all those who rely on it. But this clashes with our firm\nintuition that a broken promise harms primarily the jilted\npromisee.\n\nOne possible response to this open to a conventionalist is to move\ntowards a \u201chybrid\u201d theory, one that invokes the convention\nto explain the source of the trust of the promisee, but explains the\nharm done in breaking a promise (and thus the ground of the obligation\nto keep one) as one of betraying that trust as per the expectational\nview\n\nThis is roughly the route that Kolodny and Wallace take in their\nproposal for an expectational/conventional hybrid sort of theory in\nresponse to Scanlon, in a piece called \u201cPromises and Practices\nRevisited\u201d (2003). They argue there that the two different sorts\nof principles would satisfy two different demands\u2014the appeal to\nthe convention would explain the moral obligation, while the appeal to\nexpectations would account for the directed wrongness of\npromise-breaking.\n\nWe can understand this move as a conscious return to the bifurcated\nconventionalism of Hobbes and Hume, save in this case the view is\nontologically conventional, but normatively expectational, as opposed\nto a natural law/normative power hybrid of Hobbes.\n\nThis hybrid proposal, and the criticisms that prompted it, have also\nspawned a growing discussion among theorists (see Cureton 2015;\nShockley 2008; Roth 2016; van Roojen 2013; and Melenovsky 2017, among\nothers).\n3. Expectation Theory\n\nAs just mentioned, another approach to promissory obligations is an\nappeal to the expectations that promises create in their promisees.\nTheories of this sort claim that promises are designed to invoke\nexpectations of performance in the promisee, and that the betrayal of\nthose expectations is the wrong in breaking a promise, and thus the\nsource of the promissory obligation.\n\nExpectational approaches were initially adopted by consequentialists\nlike Bentham (A Comment on the Commentaries, 1-1-6), Sidgwick\n(The Methods of Ethics, 3\u20136), Narveson (1967, 1971),\nSinger (1972), and \u00c1rdal (1968, 1976). But in the past 50 years\nmany theorists with other normative frameworks have also put forward\nsuch views, e.g., McNeilly (1972), MacCormick (1972), Anscombe (1981:\nCh. 1), Thomson (1990: Ch. 12), T. M. Scanlon (1990, 1999: Ch. 7),\nFoot (2001: Ch. 1), and Friederich and Southwood (2011).\n\nWe can distinguish (along with Friederich & Southwood [2009,\n2011], among others) between three sorts of expectational theories on\nthe basis of what they propose is required on the part of the promisee\nto incur the obligation. The three candidates are assurance, reliance\nand trust.\n3.1 Assurance\n\nAssurance views require that the promisee seek and care for the\npromisor\u2019s assurance of performance. In other words, the\npromisee must want to be assured of the fact of the promisor\u2019s\npromissory fulfillment. The paradigm of this sort of view is\nScanlon\u2019s (1990, 1998)\n\nScanlon claims that promissory obligations derive from another sort of\nmore basic moral obligations, specifically obligations not to\n\u201cunfairly manipulate\u201d others. One has a moral duty to keep\none\u2019s promises because making a promise will lead others to\nbelieve that you will do what you promise. Breaking the promise is\nthen tantamount to deceiving those one promised, and since one has a\nmoral duty not to do this, one has a moral duty to keep one\u2019s\npromises.\n\nScanlon\u2019s principle governing a promise\u2019s generation of an\nobligation (the Principle of Fidelity, or Principle F) is:\n\n\nPrinciple F: If (1) A voluntarily and intentionally\nleads B to expect that A will do X (unless\nB consents to A\u2019s not doing so); (2)\nA knows that B wants to be assured of this; (3)\nA acts with the aim of providing this assurance, and has good\nreason to believe that he or she has done so; (4) B knows\nthat A has the intentions and beliefs just described; (5)\nA intends for B to know this, and knows that\nB does know it; (6) B knows that A has this\nknowledge and intent, then, in the absence of special justification,\nA must do X unless B consents to\nX\u2019s not being done. (Scanlon 1998: 304)\n\n\nPrinciple F is reasonable (i.e., a real moral principle with normative\nforce) because the reasons potential promisees have not to be deceived\noutweigh the reasons potential promisors have to deceive.\n\nOn Scanlon\u2019s view, it is enough that the promisee come to\nreasonably believe in the promisor\u2019s fulfillment for a breach to\nbe a wrong. The promisee need not suffer a loss, other than by\nepistemic disappointment, to be wronged.\n3.2 Reliance\n\nA more demanding requirement is that a promisee must in fact suffer\nfrom some loss or harm in order for a wrong to have occurred, and this\nis what another expectational tradition, reliance views, propose. The\nparadigm of a contemporary reliance view is Thomson\u2019s\n(1990).\n\nFor Thomson, a promise is an invitation to rely on the\npromisor\u2019s performance, where that means expect and plan around\nthat future performance, and not merely come to believe or expect\nit.\n\nSomething like a reliance understanding of promises plausibly\nunderlies the private law doctrine of \u201cconsideration\u201d,\nwhich indemnifies promisees for costs incurred as a result of such\nreliance (see\n Promise and Contract section 6.2\n below).\n3.3 Trust\n\nThe third sort of expectational view, trust views, explain promises as\ninvitations to trust, where that concept is subtly different and\nsomewhat more demanding than expectation or reliance. Friederich and\nSouthwood (2011) pioneer this approach:\n\n\nAt the heart of the Trust View is the idea of inviting someone to\ntrust one to do something. To explicate this idea, consider first\nwhat it means for someone to trust one to do something. or\nsomeone to trust one to do something she must have a certain\nfaith or optimism in one\u2019s character insofar\nas one\u2019s doing it is concerned. (Friederich & Southwood\n2011: 278)\n\n\nFurther, the trusting relation requires that the promised act\ntypically be important to and desired by the promisee. So on the trust\nview, promises are simultaneously invitations to trust in the\npromisor\u2019s execution and acknowledgments of the importance and\nvalue of the promised act, as well as the other moral characteristics\nintegral to the trusting relation. Promissory obligations are formed\non the basis of the acceptance, or \u201cuptake\u201d, in the\njargon, of these invitations to trust.\n\nAll three sorts of expectation theory employ a condition of promissory\nuptake, as mentioned above. This has led to a separate set of\ndiscussions among scholars as to the nature of this condition.\n\nThere are a number of criticisms and objections in the literature to\nthe expectational approach to promissory obligations. One group of\nproblems revolves around the claim that by making promises out to be\nmerely expectation-producing mechanisms, expectationalists collapse\nthe distinction between promising and other things, like advising,\nwarning and threatening (see Raz 1972; Peetz 1977; see also\n\u00c1rdal 1979, in response).\n\nAdjunct to these problems is the charge that the expectationalist\ncan\u2019t explain why promissory expectations produce obligations,\nin a way that other expectations don\u2019t (see Raz 1972; Owens\n2006). Elinor Mason, in a recent article on Scanlon\u2019s theory\nargues in favor of the collapse, claiming that promises are just one\nsort of inducement to trust, and the harm of breaking a promise is\nexactly the harm of misleading that might be performed by lying or\notherwise deceiving (Mason 2005).\n\nAnother traditional problem for expectational views is a charge of\ncircularity (see Robins 1976; Prichard 1949; Warnock 1971). The\nproblem is this: When I promise someone to do something then, if all\ngoes well, as a result of my promise they come to trust that I will do\nthat thing. But this trust, on the expectational view, is the source\nof my obligation to do what I promise. So it seems that the trust of\nmy promisee is both the cause and the effect of my promise, and this\nseems an unacceptable circle. The problem is best framed in epistemic\nterms, as one of the reason that a promisee has to trust a promisor.\nThe intuitively obvious reason for the trust a promisee has is that\nthe promisor has promised, and as such has placed herself under a\nmoral obligation to do the deed. This belief, combined with beliefs\nabout the moral rectitude of the promisor, give the promisee a sound\nreason to believe that the promisor will keep her promise. The problem\nfor the expectational view is that the promisee, on such a view,\ncan\u2019t rely on the fact of the promissory obligation as a reason\nto trust, since on this view that obligation rests on the prior fact\nof the trust itself. If the trust of the promisor is the ground of the\nmoral obligation to keep a promise, then prior to the promisee coming\nto trust the promisor, no such obligation exists. So when the promisee\ngoes searching for a reason to trust, the standard one is barred from\nconsideration.\n\nMoreover, if an expectationalist aims to offer a theory that explains\npromissory obligation without the invocation of a convention or\npractice of promising (like Scanlon does), then the other standard\nroute to explaining promise trust is blocked. If there is a convention\nin place that governs promises, and if that convention is such as to\ninspire confidence in promisees that promisors will keep their\npromises, then promises can be said to generate the necessary\nexpectations. But such a view is incompatible with the claim that\nconventions aren\u2019t necessary to explain promissory obligations.\nThese objections are pressed against Scanlon\u2019s theory by N.\nKolodny and R. J. Wallace (2003).\n\nAnother traditional set of problems with the expectational approach is\ntheir difficulty in handling cases where the expectations that\nnormally attend a promise are lacking. The Desert Island/Deathbed\ncases are one such problem, where the expectations are lacking because\nthe promisee is dead. Scanlon discusses another sort of case, the\nProfligate Pal (Scanlon 1998: 312) where the promisee fails to have\nthe standard expectations because the promisor (the profligate pal)\nhas made and broken too many promises in the past. In such cases\nexpectationalists must either admit that there is no obligation to\nkeep the promise, which seems very counterintuitive, or come up with\nsome reason for the obligation apart from the fact that the promise\ncreated expectations in the promisee. See the section covering\n promises to the dead [\u00a75.1],\n for more information.\n4. Interpersonal Commitments\n\nIn the last twenty years a new sort of theory of promissory\nobligations has emerged. This approach makes promissory obligations\nout to be one of a number of Sui Generis obligations (and\nother normative phenomena) that arise from interpersonal exchange. The\ntwo pre-eminent views are those of Stephen Darwall (2006, 2009, 2011)\nand Margaret Gilbert (1993, 2011, 2013).\n4.1 Joint Commitment\n\nGilbert\u2019s theory, sketched in her \u201cThree Dogmas about\nPromising\u201d (2011) makes promissory obligations a matter of\n\u201cjoint commitment\u201d, jointly made by two or more parties.\nWhereas a personal decision is a personal commitment, a promise is a\njoint commitment of promisor and promisee. More fully a promise is a\njoint commitment to endorse as a body a plan such that one person (the\npromisor) do such and such, where a joint commitment is not composed\nof two or more personal commitment (in Gilbert's sense) though each of\nthe parties is committed through it:\n\n\nA joint commitment is not a composite of two or more personal\ncommitments. It is a commitment of two or more persons by two or more\npersons. [. . . .]\u00a0 In order to create a new joint commitment\neach of the would-be parties must openly express to the others his\nreadiness together with the others to commit them all in the pertinent\nway. Once these expressions are common knowledge between the parties,\nthe joint commitment is in place\u2014as they understand. Each is\ntherefore now committed to do what he can to promote satisfaction of\nthe joint commitment in conjunction with the actions of the rest.\n(Gilbert 2011: 92\u20133)\n\n\nGilbert\u2019s work has spurred a number of commentators, and there\nis a vibrant sub-literature on her theories and related matters, see\nSheehy (2002), Carassa & Colombetti, (2014), Melenovsky (2017),\nHelmreich (2018), Kenessey (2020, among others\n4.2 Second Personal\n\nStephen Darwall\u2019s view makes promissory obligations out to be a\nspecies of what he has called \u201csecond-personal\u201d normative\nphenomena. Second-personal phenomena are many and varied, and Darwall\nplaces promises in the category of \u201ctransactions\u201d, which\nare a group, including contracts and other mutual arrangements, in\nwhich the basic second-personal authority (i.e., the power we have to\n\u201cmake claims and demands on one another\u201d) generates\nobligations to perform what is outlined in the transaction. This\nsecond-personal authority is in turn a normative basic, and Darwall\nargues that this sort of authority is necessarily assumed in all cases\nof agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nDarwall assumes that transactions can engender obligations without an\nexplicit \u201cagreement\u201d. As an example of this he cites\naccepting an invitation. As well Darwall\u2019s second-personal\nauthority story gives rise to explicitly moral obligations, through\nthe mechanism of contractualism: roughly, the sort of authority we\nhave to enter agreements is the sort necessary to ground a\nhypothetical contractualism of the Scanlonian sort.\n\n\nTo begin with the most obvious point, promises are always to some\nperson or persons. There must be a promisee who is given by virtue of\nthe promise an ensemble of rights and prerogatives she would otherwise\nnot have had. But it is also important, as I shall be arguing\npresently is true of all transactions, that it is part of the very\nidea of a promise that the promisee already has some rights\nand prerogatives (hence some (second-personal) authority to make\nclaims and demands) with respect to the promisor, as indeed with\nrespect to every other person, independently of the promise. In\nparticular, the (would be) promisee has the authority to refuse to\naccept a promise. A promise\u2019s existence is conditional on its\nacceptance (or at least not being rejected) by the promisee. I simply\ncannot make a promise to you if you refuse to accept it.\n\nIn this way, a promise is like a gift; it must be accepted or not\nrejected to be given at all. Otherwise, I will have no more than tried\nto promise (or give a gift). Various other rights and prerogatives\nderive from the would-be promisee\u2019s authority to reject the\npromise. Just as it is part of the very idea of a gift that it cannot\nbe forced on someone, so also does a would-be promisee have standing\nto demand that he be genuinely free to reject it\u2014that his\nacceptance not be forced, manipulated, extracted by deception, and so\non. (Darwall, 2011: 269\u201370)\n\n\nDarwall\u2019s work has also led to a new sub-section of the\nliterature, see Watson (2007), Korsgaard (2007), Carassa &\nColombetti (2014), Zylberman (2014), Schofield (2014), Dougherty\n(2015), Kenessey (2020), Roth (2021) among others.\n5. Issues in Promissory Theory\n\nThere are also a number of theoretical issues in promissory theory\nthat have garnered significant attention from philosophers of late. A\npartial list of these below, along with some pointers to the relevant\nliterature:\n5.1 Problematic Promisees and the Uptake Condition\n\nOne source of discussion are the issues surrounding promisees that are\nsomehow different from the paradigm promisee. The paradigm promisee is\naware of the promise, acknowledges and confirms the promissory\narrangement, welcomes or at least doesn\u2019t spurn the promised act\nand expects and/or relies on its execution or the subsequent state of\naffairs. In the literature these are called \u201cuptake\u201d\nconditions (the term was coined by Thomson [1990: 301]).\n\nMost promissory theories employ some sort of uptake condition, for\ndifferent reason (see Liberto 2018) with expectational theories\ngenerally having the more demanding ones. But not all plausible\npromisees can satisfy these conditions. These are problematic\npromisees, cases where a promise to them seems intuitively valid, but\nthe promisee fails to satisfy the uptake condition.\n\nA paradigm example of such problematic cases are promises to the dead\nor dying, since those promisees can\u2019t be disappointed or harmed.\nThat is, unless one subscribes to the view that the dead can be\nharmed, and whether or not this is even possible is a question that\nthinkers have also spent some time on (see Boonin 2019, for a survey\nof the philosophical literature here). Like promises to the self,\npromises to the dead are a commonplace in both prose and poetry take\nJane Austen\u2019s\u00a0Pride and Prejudice, or J\nStafford\u2019s\u00a0The Cremation of Sam McGee\n\nOne such sort of case that arose in the mid-twentieth century is the\nso-called \u201cDesert Island\u201d case, where a promise is made in\nisolation (on a desert island) to someone who then dies. The case was\nwielded against act utilitarians, as an example of a sort of case that\nthe expectationalist sort of views they espouse can\u2019t answer\n(see Nowell-Smith 1956; Narveson 1963: 210; Cargile 1964; Narveson\n1967: 196\u20137).\n\nBut recently scholars have widened the criticism. Nick Leonard\n(forthcoming) argues that, like the dead and dying, promisees who fail\nto have the standard cognitive capacity to rely on promises would\ncertainly fail the uptake condition for expectational theories. He\nimagines in this role small children, or people with severe cognitive\nlimitations. Such promisees are intuitively owed fidelity, but\nexpectational promissory theories can\u2019t accommodate this\njudgment, since the promisees don\u2019t have the required uptake,\ni.e., they fail to form expectations or reliance. Further Leonard\nargues that joint commitment views are similarly cognitively\ndemanding, requiring as they do complex and sophisticated mental\nstates like mutual intentions.\n\nSimilarly James S. Taylor (2021) argues that authority views like\nOwens\u2019, that appeal to the possible exercise of power over the\npromisor by the promisee, can\u2019t accommodate dead or absent\npromisees. And Hallie Liberto (2018) through a set of subtle and\nclever cases, argues that uptake conditions in both authority and\njoint commitment views might be violated even by perfectly\nparadigmatic promisees. The cases involve promisees that are either\ndelayed, absent or not yet specified at the time of the creation of\nthe promissory obligation. Liberto argues that uptake has what she\ncall a \u201cbackward reach\u201d, meaning that it must be able to\nbe satisfied after the promissory obligation has\nattached.\n\nAlbrecht (2018), argues that these sorts of promises to the dead or\nmissing, to young children, to oneself, give rise to\n\u201casymmetrical\u201d promises. On what Albrecht calls\n\u201ctransactional\u201d sorts of promissory theories a promise is\nan exchange of rights (or authority, or whatever the specific\nmechanism is) which transaction occurs between independent agents. But\nin certain cases, where the promisee is unable to fulfil their pat of\nthe transaction, the promisor can stand in for her as a proxy. But\nthis only occurs, says Albrecht, in cases where the promisor is in\nsome way already responsible for the promisee. So, when we promise our\nyoung children t, say, get them a good education, we act to accept the\npromise on their part, as a proxy for them, in our role as parent, in\nthe same way we might receive money or other things on their\nbehalf.\n\nIn another vein, A. S. Roth (2016) argues that the uptake condition\nmust be understood as the promisee intending that the\npromisor perform, as opposed to \u201cexpecting\u201d or\n\u201ctrusting\u201d such. This construal allows him to respond to\nthe circularity worry inherent in expectational views. (see the\nsection covering\n expectationalism [\u00a73.3]).\n\nFollowing Scanlon, Roth analyses the circularity worry in epistemic\nterms, as a lack of justification for the belief in performance on the\npart of the promisee. But, argues Roth, intentional beliefs, of the\nsort we form when we form an intention to do some act don\u2019t\ntypically require epistemic justification. If I intend to take a walk,\nI come to believe that I will, and that belief is reasonable (ceteris\nparibus) without any other evidence that I will do so.\n\nSo (argues Roth) if we construe the promisee as intending that the\npromisor perform the promised act, and if we take intentions\nas cognitive, i.e., as partly constituted by beliefs, then we can\navoid the need for justification, and thus the circularity, since\nbeliefs of this sort don\u2019t typically require justification:\n\n\nBy offering a sufficiently attractive invitation (which most promises\nare), the promisor leads the promisee to accept. And the promisee\naccepts by intending the promisor\u2019s action. So we have a case of\nthe promisor leading the promisee to a belief (as required by\nPrinciple F), but not in a way that requires evidence. For, if\nCognitivism is true, the expectation that comes with the intention to\n\u03d5 is normally not based on evidence. [\u2026] Notice, also,\nthat the process described is entirely compatible with the expectation\n(hence acceptance) being voluntary. An attractive invitation was made\nand voluntarily accepted: the promisee voluntarily intends the\npromisor\u2019s action, and given Cognitivism, thereby forms the\nexpectation. (Roth 2016: 111)\n\n\nThis turn has also sparked some recent discussion, see Sharadin\n(2018), Shaver (2019), Dannenberg (2019), Kenessey (2020) and Lichter\n(2021)\n5.2 Promises to the Self and the Promisee Release Condition\n\nAnother sort of problematic case that has come in for some recent\nattention is the case of promising oneself. The idea of the self\npromises is a commonplace, in the vernacular as well as in poetry and\nprose (see Migotti 2003). But how self promises might produce\nobligations is a difficult question to answer for many promissory\ntheories.\n\nTraditionally self promises (and their counterparts, pledges,\nresolutions and similar commitments) have been discounted as proper\npromises, but there have been a number of recent attempts to vindicate\nself promises in the literature, and provide some positive explanation\nfor their normative force.\n\nConnie Rosati, in her influential piece \u201cThe Importance of Self\nPromises\u201d (2011) argues that self promises are, rather than a\nperipheral phenomena, the paradigmatic instance of promising\u2014as\nthey are exercises of our authority over ourselves. This idea is not\nwithout antecedent\u2014R.S. Downie says something similar in his\n1985 \u201cThree Accounts of Promising\u201d, as Rosati\nacknowledges. But Rosati\u2019s account is more\ndeveloped\u2014appealing to Owens-style authority and Darwall\u2019s\nsecond-personal normative framework.\n\nJorah Dannenberg (2015), in a Neitszchean vein, argues that self\npromises are a way of solidifying our wills, protecting our valued\nchoices from deterioration in the face of time and trials. And Janis\nSchaab (2021) argues against what she calls the\n\u201cincoherence\u201d argument against the possibility of one\nreleasing oneself from a promise.\n\nA central issue in this sub-literature is this last\u2014the problem\nof promisee release. This problem goes all the way back to Hobbes, who\nsays of self promises:\n\n\nNor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe ; because he\nthat can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to himselfe\nonely, is not bound. (Leviathan part II, ch. 26)\n\n\nIn cases of self promise, since the promisor is also the promisee, and\nso can release herself, then we are faced with Hobbes\u2019\nchallenge. Many authors have grappled with this puzzle\u2014some,\nlike Liberman (2019) move to drop the promisee release condition, and\nclaim that some sorts of self promise, like vows, cannot be revoked.\nOthers, like Habib (2009) and Schaab (2021), look to accept promisee\nrelease and explain Hobbes\u2019 difficulty away.\n5.3 Vows, Oaths and Related Phenomena\n\nAnother set of promissory issues that has received some recent\nattention from scholars concerns other phenomena of what we might call\n\u201cself-binding\u201d, things like vows, oaths, pledges and\nresolutions. In promissory theory proper, there has been some focus on\nthese with the end of informing a comprehensive promissory theory, one\nthat might go some distance to explain these related phenomena.\n5.3.1 Vows\n\nWork on vows has occurred in different contexts, and between different\nvoices, within and outside of philosophy. Wedding vows and religious\nvows in particular have been the object of some recent work.\n\nKyle Fruh (2019) surveys the difficulties some promissory theories,\nand in particular expectational theories have in accommodating these\nnotions, and offers that any reasonably successful theory of promises\nwould likely have to explain these phenomena as well. He calls this\nthe \u201cbreadth\u201d requirement:\n\n\nOaths and vows partially fill out what I call the \u201cbreadth\ncriterion\u201d: Theories of promising should cover not only\ncustomary, interpersonal promises but also sibling phenomena,\nincluding oaths and vows. Promises, oaths, and vows are all forms of\nvoluntary binding commitments; indeed, the terms are often used\ninterchangeably. They should be taken up into theory together. The\nfamiliar and powerful grounds for this intuitive idea are at least\ntwofold: It is more parsimonious to have a single theory that covers\nthe entire family rather than developing distinct theories for each of\nthe phenomena, and if there is such a theory, its explanatory power\nwill compare favorably to theories that fail to cover some of the\nphenomena in question. A theory of promising that is silent about\noaths and vows is one we have less reason to accept than one that can\nilluminate the capacity of oaths and vows to produce moral\nobligations. Provisionally at least, the breadth criterion should be\napplied to competing theories of promising. (Fruh 2019: 859)\n\n\nOn vows per se, in addition to Fruh\u2019s work, novel\ntheories of the obligation of vows have been advanced by Alida\nLiberman (2019), who makes vows out to be a species of resolution.\n\nIn another vein, Elizabeth Brake, in her widely read 2011 piece\n\u201cIs Divorce Promise Breaking\u201d argues that wedding vows\ncan\u2019t be construed as promises, on pain of saying that divorce\nis promise breaking. Brake argues for this and other reasons, wedding\nvows shouldn\u2019t be taken as promises at all.\n\nBrake\u2019s work has in turn spurred further dialogue on wedding\nvows as promises, see Gheaus (2017), Cowley (2020), and Liberman\n(2021).\n5.3.2 Oaths\n\nLike promises, oaths play a part in many different human undertakings.\nIn politics, at least among democracies, oaths of office for those in\npositions of power are the norm. In the professions oaths like the\nHippocratic oath sworn by doctors, are also very common. In cases of\ntestimony in court, testimonial oaths are standard, and witnesses are\nasked to swear oaths of veracity for their affidavits or other\ntestimony.\n\nTraditionally oaths were understood as a separate species of\nobligation-producing commitment, a \u201ccalling to witness\u201d of\nGod to bolster a claim to veracity on the part of the swearer.\nAquinas, for example divides them into four types: Calls to witness\ntruths of the past or present, which he calls declaratory oaths, and\nclaims of some future conduct, which are promissory oaths. Further,\noaths can be either simple invitations to witnessings, which are\nsimply oaths, or they can be invitations to punish the swearer for\ndefault, which are curses:\n\n\n[O]aths are taken for the purpose of confirmation. Now speculative\npropositions receive confirmation from reason, which proceeds from\nprinciples known naturally and infallibly true. But particular\ncontingent facts regarding man cannot be confirmed by a necessary\nreason, wherefore propositions regarding such things are wont to be\nconfirmed by witnesses. Now a human witness does not suffice to\nconfirm such matters for two reasons. First, on account of man\u2019s\nlack of truth, for many give way to lying, according to Ps. 16:10,\n\u201cTheir mouth hath spoken lies [Vulg.:\n\u2018proudly\u2019]\u201d. Secondly, on account of [his] lack of\nknowledge, since he can know neither the future, nor secret thoughts,\nnor distant things: and yet men speak about such things, and our\neveryday life requires that we should have some certitude about them.\nHence the need to have recourse to a Divine witness, for neither can\nGod lie, nor is anything hidden from Him. Now to call God to witness\nis named jurare (to swear) because it is established as\nthough it were a principle of law (jure) that what a man\nasserts under the invocation of God as His witness should be accepted\nas true. Now sometimes God is called to witness when we assert present\nor past events, and this is termed a \u201cdeclaratory oath\u201d;\nwhile sometimes God is called to witness in confirmation of something\nfuture, and this is termed a \u201cpromissory oath\u201d. But oaths\nare not employed in order to substantiate necessary matters, and such\nas come under the investigation of reason; for it would seem absurd in\na scientific discussion to wish to prove one\u2019s point by an oath.\n(Summa II-II q.89-Art. i)\n\nA person is called to give witness, in order that he may make known\nthe truth about what is alleged. Now there are two ways in which God\nmakes known whether the alleged facts are true or not. In one way He\nreveals the truth simply, either by inward inspiration, or by\nunveiling the facts, namely, by making public what was hitherto\nsecret: in another way by punishing the lying witness, and then He is\nat once judge and witness, since by punishing the liar He makes known\nhis lie. Hence oaths are of two kinds: one is a simple contestation of\nGod, as when a man says \u201cGod is my witness\u201d, or, \u201cI\nspeak before God\u201d, or, \u201cBy God\u201d, which has the same\nmeaning, as Augustine states [*See argument On the contrary]; the\nother is by cursing, and consists in a man binding himself or\nsomething of his to punishment if what is alleged be not true.\n(ibid., Reply Obj. 3)\n\n\nSo oaths are ways of bolstering one\u2019s claim to veracity by\ncalling on God to witness your claim. If your claim is about your\nfuture conduct, then the oath can be understood as a promise, with God\nas the promisee. You can invite god to witness alone, on the tacit\nunderstanding that he sees and knows all and will take account, or you\ncan invite him to punish you for falsity directly, e.g \u201cMay God\nstrike me down\u201d or \u201cGod blind me\u201d\n(\u201cblimey\u201d).\n\nRecent philosophical work has tended to recapitulate this analysis,\nabsent the divine promisee. This broadens the appeal, certainly, but\nit means a substantial change in the nature of the grounding of the\nobligation.\n\nThomas Scanlon, in his influential 1990 piece \u201cPromises and\nPractices\u201d, is an example of this. Scanlon offers roughly the\nsame meaning of the term, and rehearses the Thomistic distinctions\nbetween testamentary and promissory oaths, but he makes oaths out to\nbe not invitations to witness or punish, but rather invocations of\nimportant or sacred objects or ideas:\n\n\nIn an oath a person says, in support of a claim to be telling the\ntruth or to have a sincere and reliable intention to do a certain\nthing, \u201cI swear to you by \u2026\u201d, naming here something\nto which he or she is assumed to attach great value, such as God, the\nBible, or the memory of a loved one. It is not necessary that the\nvalue appealed to involve a code of honor or convention of\ntruth-telling. What is claimed is simply that the speaker\u2019s\nsincerity in making the present claim is comparable to the sincerity\nof his or her devotion to the value named. It would cheapen such a\nvalue, and hence be incompatible with true devotion to it, to invoke\nit for personal advantage in support of an insincere claim. Of course,\nsome think that it is incompatible with holding something sacred to\ninvoke it in sup port of any claim, which is why some religions forbid\nthe use of holy texts or the name of God in this way. (Scanlon 1990:\n223)\n\n\nThis move allows the analysis to survive the removal of God as a\npromisee, but subtly substitutes the receiver of the vow (\u201cI\nswear to you\u2026\u201d) in its place.\n\nFruh (2019) resists this move, and disputes the understanding of oaths\nas \u201cdirected\u201d toward a counterparty. He argues at some\nlength against the plausibility of various candidate counterparties\n(promisees) for standard oaths. Rather, for Fruh oaths should be\nunderstood as a sui generis form of voluntary obligation,\ndifferent from promises and vows in that it is without a\n\u201ccounterparty\u201d. Liberman (2021) instead argues that oath\nand vows should be understood as \u201cexceptionless\nresolutions\u201d, both without counterparty, and both different than\ntraditional promise.\n5.4 Promissory Reasons\n\nAnother set of issues that have been discussed in the literature we\nmight call issues of promissory psychology. These are issues\nconcerning the mental states of promisors and promisees, and the role\nthese play in producing, explaining or justifying promissory\nobligations. The main focus is on promissory reasons.\n\nWhat reasons do promisors have to keep promises? How do these\npromissory come about and how do they function? How strong are they,\nand what, if any, reasons may override them? These are just some of\nthe most common questions in this area, and the literature on them is\nquite large, too large to adequately survey here, so I will just note\nsome important foci. Of particular interest are the answers to these\nquestions provided by Joseph Raz (1975, 1982, 1986, 2012).\n\nRaz proposes a system of practical rationality with two sorts of\nreasons, of first and second order. First order reasons are reason for\nor against courses of action, while second order reasons are reasons\nabout reasons themselves. Exclusionary reasons are second order\nreasons that exclude other, first order reasons. Promises, says Raz,\nproduce (in the promisor) both first order reasons to perform the\npromised act as well as second order exclusionary reasons to bar from\nconsiderations most first order reasons that counsel against keeping\nthe promise.\n\n\nLet us say that a person does A for the reason that\np if and only if he does A because he believes that\np is a reason for him to do A. A person refrains\nfrom doing A for the reason that p if and only if it\nis not the case that he does A for the reason that\np. In other words a person refrains from acting for a reason\nif he does not do the act or does it but not for this reason.\n\u201cRefrains\u201d is used here in an extended sense which does\nnot imply that the agent intentionally avoids acting for the reason. A\nsecond order reason is any reason to act for a reason or to refrain\nfrom acting for a reason. An exclusionary reason is a second order\nreason to refrain from acting for some reason. (Raz 1975: 487)\n\n\nMoreover, on the Razian picture exclusionary reasons are\n\u201ccontent independent\u201d reasons. This is the notion\n(original with Hart [1958, 1982] cited in Sciaraffa 2009) that a\nreason for action is independent of the \u201ccontent\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d of the action they implicate:\n\nThere is a vibrant literature, spanning many decades, engaging with\nRaz\u2019s intriguing suggestions. see Sciaraffa (2009) for a survey\nof some of the earlier literature on this. More recent work can be\nfound in McBride (2015), MacMahon (2018), Molina (2019), Murphy\n(2020), Kimel (forthcoming), and others. Much of this work is in legal\ntheory, on the philosophical underpinnings of private law.\n6. Promises and Other Fields\n\nIn addition to the various positive theories of promising, there are\nalso several other issues of philosophical interest concerning the\nintersection of promissory theory and other fields or theoretical\nframeworks. In the following sections I try and outline some of these,\nand provide some guides to the literature.\n6.1 Promises and Speech Acts\n\nPromises have often been cast as speech acts, or actions that we\nperform by speaking. The locus classicus for this issue is J.\nL. Austin\u2019s 1962 book How to Do Things with Words. In\nit Austin defines two sorts of speech acts, or\n\u201cperformatives\u201d: illocutions and perlocutions. Illocutions\nare those actions that we perform by uttering the words alone. Austin\nlists requesting, warning and announcing as examples. Alternatively,\nperlocutions are actions performed by speaking which require some\nparticular effect of the speech in order to be successful.\nAustin cites persuading, explaining and alarming as examples of the\nlatter sort of locution.\n\nAustin takes promising to be an illocutionary act, that is, he takes\nit that promising is merely a matter of a certain form of\nutterance, under certain conditions. Moreover the reason he takes this\nto be is that he thinks that promising is a conventional act,\none that invokes a certain practice to formalize the action. Austin\nthinks that in this way promises are just of a piece with many sorts\nof obligation-producing actions, such as betting, buying and\ncontracting (Austin 1962 [1975: 19])\n\nAustin\u2019s linguistic distinction mirrors the crucial difference\nbetween the expectational and conventional theories of promising. On\nthe conventionalist view that Austin adopts, promises are\n\u201cconventional\u201d moves in the game, and as such one promises\nby \u201cmaking the right moves\u201d, i.e., saying the right sorts\nof things and otherwise obeying the rules of the game.\n\nSearle, taking up the speech-act framework pioneered by J. L.\nAustin\u2014similarly makes promises out to be a particular form of\nspeech act\u2014(see Searle 1963, 1965, 1965, 1979) a non-verbal\naction affected by speech, of a piece with \u201cordering\u201d and\n\u201cagreeing\u201d. Searle, like Austin, is a paradigmatic\nconventionalist his work has been widely influential, and has helped\nto grow the literature on both promises and speech act theory (cf.\nSearle et al. 1980, inter alia)\n\nThe investigation of promises as speech acts is furthered in the work\nof Rawls (1955), William Alston (1964, 1994), John Searle (1963, 1965,\n1979, 1980, 1985), David Jones (1966), Otto Hanfling (1975), and\nMichael Pratt (2003, 2007), Christina Corredor (2001), and Vincent\nBlok (2013) among others. See Harris and McKinney (2021) for a\ncontemporary survey\n6.2 Promise, Contracts and the Law\n\nThe relationship between the law, contracts and promises is a long and\ntangled one. From its ancient origins promissory theory has been\nintertwined with issues of contracts and agreements more generally.\nAnd since at least the time of Aquinas and especially with the works\nof the later Natural Lawyers like Grotius and Pufendorf, scholarly\nwork on promising has been done at least in part with an eye towards\ninforming the law of contract. This in turn gave rise to a tradition\non the part of legal theorists of surveying such scholarship in their\nwork on both historical and contemporary issues in the law of\ncontract. Finally, the law itself has methods for dealing with\npromises (as they are obviously the sorts of things that might lead to\nlegal wrangling). Thus the legal practice regarding promises has some\ninterest to theorists of promising as well. The result is two\ninterlinked scholarly traditions and bodies of work.\n\nPerhaps the first question on the mind of legal and philosophical\nhistorians is the issue of the degree to which, if any, contractual\nobligations are grounded in promissory obligations in contemporary\nlegal regimes. This question is complicated by the different\ntraditions and cultures involved in the long path to contemporary law,\ni.e., natural law theory, virtue theory, rights theory, the (anglo)\ncommon law, the continental civilian law, canon law and other\ntheoretical approaches, which are in turn variously situated in the\nUK, on the European continent, and in the anglo territories (Scotland,\nAustralia, Canada the US, etc.). The answer to the question is\ndifferent in different traditions and places, and the contemporary law\nis the result of some complicated amalgamation of these different\ntraditions over time. For an overview of these issues, see, e.g.,\nGordley (1991), Ibbetson (1999), Markovits (2011), Swain (2013), or\nFried (1981, 2015).\n\nOne central dialectic within this corpus has the \u201cnormative\npower\u201d tradition of the natural lawyers pitted against the more\nexpectational views of the English common law. As Atiyah notes (1981:\nch. 6), there is a tension between the Natural Law promissory theory\nand the actual law of contract and promise plainly evident in the\nBritish common law. One source of the tension is the common law\ndoctrine of \u201cconsideration\u201d, which mandates that only\npromises given with \u201cconsideration\u201d, i.e., given in\nexchange for something of value, are enforceable in the law. In other\nwords, mere promises, given without consideration, are traditionally\nnot indemnified by the law.\n\nFurther, as Lon Fuller and William Perdue pointed out in an\ninfluential 1936/37 article \u201cThe Reliance Interest in Contract\nDamages\u201d, the damages awarded by courts to those who have had a\npromise or contract broken is best understood as being proportional to\nthe harm the plaintiff suffered in relying on the promise. These and\nother considerations argue for a theory of promises based on\nexpectations and reliance, i.e., an expectational theory, as opposed\nto one based on conventions or natural duties, and this is what a\nnumber of philosophers and legal theorists have done. This debate has\nspawned a sizable literature (see Swain 2013 for a good overview of\nthis work).\n\nCharles Fried\u2019s widely influential book Contract as\nPromise (1981) re-kindled this debate in American legal circles.\nFried argued that the traditional approach, which made contractual\nobligation out to be grounded in promissory obligation, was slowly\nbeing usurped by the consequentialist-flavored approaches of the\nEnglish common law, and he aimed his book as a polemic against this\nmovement.\n\nFried took on these arguments directly, and the corpus of work that\nsprang from the book greatly enlarged the debate. In 2012 a special\nconference and subsequent issue of the Suffolk University Law Review\nrevisited Fried\u2019s work, 30 years on. This new corpus of work\nprovides us with some interesting new explorations. As an example of\nthis, see Brian Bix\u2019s assessment in his essay (2012). Subsequent\nto this Fried released an updated version of the book in 2015, which\nin turn has spawned a more recent literature (see Markovits 2020;\nSaprai 2013; Bix 2017; Encarnacion 2018)\n\nAnd the legal academy continues to work on the relation between the\nconcepts and the theoretical foundations of contract law, with\nscholars like Markovits (2011), Shiffrin (2006, 2012), Pratt (2007,\n2014) Encarnacion (2018), Saprai (2017) and many others contributing.\nFor an excellent overview of the theoretical work see the SEP entry on\n contract law.\n6.3 Promises and Consequentialism\n\nConsequentialism has always had a fraught relationship with promises\nand promissory obligation. It has been a traditional challenge to\nconsequentialist views, particularly earlier, act-based forms, to\nexplain promissory obligations, as they aren\u2019t necessarily\n\u201cfelicific\u201d, or productive of the most good. Of course,\nnot all consequentialist views are of this sort.\n\nConsequentialist theories of promissory obligation fall into two broad\ncamps: Act utilitarians are expectationalists\u2014generally explain\npromissory obligations as arising from the negative consequences of\nbreaking the promise. Rule utilitarians are conventionalists, and\ndefend promissory obligations on the grounds that the rule of\npromise-keeping is productive of the best consequences.\n6.3.1 Act Utilitarianism\n\nAct utilitarians evaluate individual actions in light of the net\nutility produced by that action as compared to alternative actions.\nThe right action is that which promotes the maximum net utility. On\nthe face of it, this entirely general and comprehensive maxim leaves\nno room for considerations of prior promise. The fact that an agent\npromised someone something has no direct relevance to an act\nconsequentialist appraisal of that agent\u2019s action at the time\nthe promise is meant to be kept. If breaking the promise would promote\nmore utility than keeping it, then the theory seems to mandate\nbreaking the promise.\n\nThis counter-intuitive result has been offered as a criticism of act\nutilitarianism since its inception. That act utilitarians have\ndifficulty in accounting for the force of promises is a touchstone for\ncritics (see Prichard 1949; Ross 1930; Hodgson 1967).\n\nBut act utilitarians do have some resources to accommodate our moral\nintuitions about promises, and the sort of theory they employ is held\nby more than just utilitarians .The act utilitarian explanation for\npromissory obligations is that these obligations arise from the\nnegative consequences that attend the breaking of promises, where\nthese negative consequences are, at least in part, created by the\neffects of the promise on the promisee, specifically, the creation in\nthe promisee of the expectation that the promisor will keep her\npromise. A sample list of utilitarianism that have either offered or\ndefended such a view: Bentham (A Comment on the Commentaries,\n1-1-6), Sidgwick (The Methods of Ethics, 1874 [1962:\n3\u20136]), Narveson (1967, 1971), Singer (1972), and \u00c1rdal\n(1968, 1976).\n\nIn support of this picture utilitarians argue that promises are the\nsorts of things which are generally made because the promisee wants\nthe thing promised, and so wants to be assured of getting it. Since a\npromise is designed to secure his trust, and that trust is then likely\nto be the source of much pain if it\u2019s disappointed, it\u2019s\nreasonable to assume that in most cases keeping one\u2019s promise\nwill be productive of better consequences than breaking them, given\nthe expectations of the promisee. And there are other potential\nnegative consequences of breaking a promise (e.g., the loss of trust\nby one\u2019s familiars, the general erosion of trust in the practice\nof promises) that utilitarians can add to the negative side of the\nledger. For an astute philosophical survey of Act Utilitarian\napproaches to promising see Atiyah (1981: 30\u201379), also Robins\n(1984: 140\u2013143) and Vitek (1993: 61\u201370).\n\nAs mentioned above, the standard critique of the act utilitarian\ntheory of promissory obligations is that it doesn\u2019t accord with\nour intuitive judgment that at least some promises that don\u2019t\nproduce the maximum utility still ought to be kept. In claiming that\nutilitarianism has unacceptably counter-intuitive results in certain\ncases, this argument it is of a piece with most arguments against the\nview. One sort of counter-intuitive case that has received some\nattention is the so-called \u201cDesert Island\u201d case, where a\npromise is made in isolation (on a desert island) to someone who then\ndies. The question is whether there is any obligation to keep the\npromise, given that the promisee can\u2019t have any expectations of\nits fulfillment (being dead) and that no-one else can know of the\npromise (see Nowell-Smith 1956; Narveson 1963: 210; Cargile 1964;\nNarveson 1967: 196\u20137). See the section on\n Problematic Promisees and the Uptake Condition (\u00a75.1]\n above for more information.\n\nA more sophisticated problem outlined by Hodgson (1967: 38) and others\nis that a promising convention is broadly speaking incompatible with\nan act utilitarian society. This is so because such a convention\ncouldn\u2019t get established (or couldn\u2019t be sustained) if\npeople were aware that everyone was a consistent utility maximizer of\nthe act utilitarian sort. If this were the case people would put no\nstock in promises, knowing that when the time came to keep the\npromise, the promisor would simply apply the utilitarian calculus,\nwithout regard to the fact that he had previously\n\u201cpromised\u201d, as this is what being an act utilitarian\nmeans.\n\nNote that the utilitarian cannot reply that we have failed to take\ninto account the expectations of the promisee in our case, because the\nclaim is that the promisee has no reason to generate any special\nexpectations that the promisor will do what she promises, precisely\nbecause he knows the promisor to be an act utilitarian, and\nconsequently knows that she will do what the utility calculus tells\nher is best, without thought of her promise. Of course, the promisee\nis free to generate some expectations that the promisor will keep her\npromise on the assumption that her promise is indicative of her at\nleast having the (present) intention to perform the promised act. But,\nas Raz (1972), Kolodny and Wallace (2003) and others point out, the\nadvising of the promisee of one\u2019s mere intention to do the\npromised act is insufficient ground for the sorts of expectations that\nare meant to attend promises.\n\nMore recently there have been some efforts to rehabilitate act\nutilitarianism with regards to promissory obligations. Some theorists,\nlike Michael Smith (1994, 2011), propose that sophisticating the\ntheory with the addition of other values might allow it to accommodate\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d values like promise keeping (M. Smith\n2011: 208\u2013215).\n\nOthers, like Alastair Norcross, offer a negative defense, arguing that\nthe sorts of counter-examples generally adduced to demonstrate the\nproblem don\u2019t survive scrutiny (Norcross 2011). Norcross also\nproposes an indirect form of consequentialism, one where the decision\nprocedure consciously adopted by agents isn\u2019t the same as theory\nitself. This sort of approach is outlined by Peter Railton (1984).\n6.3.2 Rule Utilitarianism\n\nThe sorts of difficulties that promises pose for act utilitarian\ntheories discussed above are at least in part the motivation for rule\nutilitarianism (see Rawls 1955 and Brandt 1979: 286\u2013305). Rule\nutilitarians change the context of moral evaluation from individual\nacts to rules governing actions. The principle of utility is applied\nto rules and practices, rather than individual acts, and the best rule\nor practice is that produces the best over-all consequences. Some\nnotable rule utilitarians are Urmson (1953), Brandt (1959, 1979), and\nHooker (2000, 2011).\n\nOf special note here is Rawls\u2019 1955 paper we discussed above in\nthe context of conventionalism, \u201cTwo Concepts of Rules\u201d,\nwhich advanced a rule-utilitarian defense of promissory obligations\nand helped to focus the debate on promising By changing the focus from\nact to rule, rule utilitarians are better able to explain our moral\nintuitions regarding individual cases of promise-keeping. But in\nparticular, rule utilitarians claim that their theory can make sense\nof the origin and maintenance of the practice of promising itself.\nUnlike an act utilitarian society, promising and trusting in promises\nmakes sense in a rule utilitarian society, because promisees can rest\nassured that promisors won\u2019t do the local utility calculation to\ndetermine whether or not to keep their promises, but rather will obey\nthe rule of promising.\n\nOne problem for the rule utilitarian theory of promissory obligations\nis that it seems that utilitarian society couldn\u2019t establish a\npractice of promising, because prior to the establishment of the rule,\npeople could have no expectations that promises would be kept. As\nsuch, those receiving the first promises would not be able to form the\nexpectations necessary to make the rule actually productive of the\nbest consequences. This is so because the consequential value of the\nrule of promise keeping depends on the expectations of promisees. Such\nexpectations are the grounds of trust, and trust is how promising\ngenerates its benefits (see Robins 1984: 142\u20133). In response,\nBrandt argues for what he calls ideal rule utilitarianism,\nwhich makes the frame of reference for rule consideration not the\nactual rules available, but the ideal rule, i.e., the rule that would\nbe optimific (productive of the best possible consequences), were it\nemployed. There is substantial criticism of this move (see Diggs\n1970). Again, an excellent (although now dated) survey of the\nrule-utilitarian approach to promising is found in Atiyah (1981:\n79\u201386).\n\nSince the turn of the century Brad Hooker has offered newer versions\nof Brandt-style rule-utilitarianism (he calls it\nrule-consequentialism) (2000, 2011) with an eye towards solving these\nsorts of problems. This work has in turn spawned another chapter in\nthis literature (see Eggleston 2007; Arneson 2005; Wall 2009; Cureton\n2015).\n\nAnd work continues on these issues, see Sinnott-Armstrong (2009), Gill\n(2012), Melenovsky (2017). For an excellent contemporary survey of\nthis issue, see Alida Liberman\u2019s \u201cConsequentialism and\nPromises\u201d in the Oxford Handbook of Consequentialism\n(2020).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albrecht, Ingrid V., 2018, \u201cGraveside and Other Asymmetrical\nPromises\u201d, <em>Social Theory and Practice</em>, 44(4):\n469\u2013483. doi:10.5840/soctheorpract201891344", "Alston, William P., 1964, <em>The Philosophy of Language</em>,\nEnglewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1994, \u201cIllocutionary Acts and\nLinguistic Meaning\u201d, in <em>Foundations of Speech Act Theory:\nPhilosophical and Linguistic Perspectives</em>, S.
