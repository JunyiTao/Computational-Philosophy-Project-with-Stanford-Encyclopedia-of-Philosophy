    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\n\nSextus Empiricus was a Pyrrhonian Skeptic living probably in the\nsecond or third century CE, many of whose works survive, including the\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism, which is the best and fullest account\nwe have of Pyrrhonian skepticism. (Book I of that work consists of\nSextus\u2019 codification of the nature of Pyrrhonian skepticism,\nwhich he contrasts with the outlooks of other schools of philosophy.)\nFittingly, we know little or nothing about the life of Sextus\nEmpiricus, including when and where he lived. Best estimates put him\nanywhere between 100 CE and the first half of the third century CE\n(House 1980), but it has been suggested that he was already well known\nby the end of the second century (Barnes 2000: xii). Sextus is called\n\u2018Empiricus\u2019 because he belonged to the Empirical School of\nMedicine (Deichgr\u00e4ber 1965: 40\u20131). There were three main schools\nof medicine, the Rationalists, the Empiricists, and the Methodists.\nConfusingly, even though Sextus was an Empiricist, he actually states\nin Outlines of Pyrrhonism I 236 that while Pyrrhonism is very\nsimilar to the Empirical School of Medicine, Pyrrhonists \u2018might\nrather adopt\u2019 Methodism. This is a standing puzzle for\ninterpreters of Sextus (see\n section 3.7 below).\n2. Works\n2.1 Surviving Works\n\n\nThe surviving works are grouped under two headings.\n2.1.1 Outlines of Pyrrhonism (Pyrrhoniae Hypotyposes)\n(This is usually referred to by the abbreviation PH.)  Works\nof Classical literature were normally divided into \u2018books\u2019\n(Plato\u2019s Republic is in ten books, Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics is in eight, etc.); PH is in three\nbooks. They are not given separate titles by scholars, and are just\nreferred to as PH I, II, and III. PH I is a complete\ndescription of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, stating what it is that makes\none qualify as a Pyrrhonian skeptic (the possession of a certain\nskill) and what the pay-off for being a Skeptic is (tranquillity),\ndetailing the various \u2018Modes\u2019 of argumentation that the\nSkeptic deploys (mastery of which constitutes the skill which defines\nthe skeptic) and the various phrases the Skeptic uses to indicate his\ncharacteristic state of mind, namely epoch\u00ea or\n\u2018suspension of judgment\u2019, and differentiating Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism from other philosophical schools with which it might seem\nto have affinities. In PH II and III, Sextus lays out the\npositions of Dogmatic philosophers on issues of logic (PH\nII), and physics and ethics (PH III), complete with Skeptical\ncounterarguments to those positions: essentially, we see Sextus in\nPH II and III exercising the Skeptical skill which he had\ndescribed in PH I. (With Sextus\u2019 description of Pyrrhonian Skepticism, compare that in DL (Diogenes La\u00ebrtius) IX 61\u2013116; for discussion of the differences, see the papers in Vogt 2015.) \n2.1.2  Against the Mathematicians (Adversus Mathematicos)\n(This is usually referred to by the abbreviation M.)  The\nwork is in eleven books, referred to as M I, II, III,\netc. These books have separate titles:\n\n\nM I: Against the Grammarians\nM II: Against the Rhetoricians\nM III: Against the Geometers\nM IV: Against the Arithmeticians\nM V: Against the Astrologers\nM VI: Against the Musicians\nM VII & VIII: Against the Logicians\nM IX & X: Against the Physicists\nM XI: Against the Ethicists\n\n\n\n\nThe word in the title translated \u2018Mathematicians\u2019 more\nliterally means \u2018learned\u2019 (think of the suffix\n\u2018-math\u2019 in \u2018polymath\u2019), so some people\ntranslate the title \u2018Against the Professors\u2019; Blank (1998:\nxvi) suggests \u2018Against the Professors of the Liberal\nStudies\u2019; Cooper (2012: 429) suggests \u2018Against the\nTheoreticians\u2019; Bett 2018 translates the title \u2018Against Those\nin the Disciplines\u2019. (Mathematics in a stricter sense is the target of\nM III and IV.) In fact, not all eleven books united under the\ntitle Against the Mathematicians belong together: we are\ndealing here with two works. As is clear from the way M I\nopens and M VI closes, M I\u2013VI constitute a complete\nwork\u2014the work which strictly speaking bears the title\nAgainst the Mathematicians (Blank 1998: xvi). The remaining\nbooks, M VII\u2013XI, also go together. Their contents shadow very\nclosely the contents of PH II (M VII & VIII)\nand III (M IX\u2013XI), expanding on them as appropriate\n(PH is, after all, just an \u2018outline\u2019). Janacek\n1963 argues that M VII\u2013XI form part of a larger work which was\na lengthy elaboration of all the parts of PH; if this is\nright, then we have lost the book or books of that work which\ncorrespond to book I of the Outlines. (The observation that\nthe larger work was an elaboration of PH is non-committal as\nto the order of composition of the two works. Janacek thought\nM was written after PH; against this, see Bett 1997:\nappendix C, and Schofield 2007: 321 n. 57.) The loss of the part\ncorresponding to PH I is greatly to be regretted, since much\nof the philosophical interest surrounding Pyrrhonian skepticism comes\nout of Sextus\u2019 description of it in PH I (indeed, most\nof this entry concerns PH I). Even though M VII\u2013XI do\nnot belong to the same work as M I\u2013VI, it is customary amongst\nscholars to refer to all eleven books as M I\u2013XI (Bett 2012:\nx).\n\n\n(When scholars cite passages from PH and M, they\nusually include the book number and section number within that book, so\n\u2018PH I 13\u2019 means book one of PH, section\n13.)\n2.2 Lost Works\n\n\nThe ancients do not refer to their books using titles in the way we\ndo. Often, Sextus refers to the books we know as PH or\nM using other descriptions. For instance, at M VI 52\nhe says: \n \nthat sound is non-existent has been proved by us in our\nskeptical commentaries (en tois skeptikois\nhypomn\u00eamatois), from the evidence of the Dogmatists,\n \nwhich is pretty clearly a reference to M VIII 131, and at\nM VI 61 he says:\n \nthat time is nothing we have already\nestablished in our Pyrrhonian writings (en tois\nPyrrh\u00f4neiois)\u2019,\n \nwhich is either a reference to\nPH III 136\u201350 or M X 169\u2013247 (Brochard 1887: 319\u201320).\nMost of Sextus\u2019 references to his own works can be explained this\nway. However, a couple of times Sextus refers to his writings in ways\nwhich suggest that there are some treatises we no longer have (in\naddition to the part of M corresponding to PH I):\n\nM VII 202: \u2018medical commentaries\u2019\n(\u1f30\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1); presumably\nthe same as M I 61: \u2018empiric commentaries\u2019\n(\u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1);\nM VI 55, \u2018the commentaries on the soul\u2019,\nand X 284 \u2018in the writings on the soul\u2019.\n\n3. The nature of Sextus\u2019 Pyrrhonism (PH I)\n3.1 What do Skeptics do, and where do they get their name?\n\n\nWhen you investigate whether P, there are three possibilities: (i)\nyou discover something (you find that the reasons for believing one of\nP and not-P outweigh any reasons for believing the other), or (ii) you\ndeny that it is possible to discover whether P, or (iii) you find that\nso far, the reasons for believing that P and the reasons for believing\nthat not-P balance each other out, and so you keep on investigating\n(PH I 1). So-called \u2018Dogmatic\u2019 philosophers think\nthey make discoveries when they investigate; \u2018Academic\u2019\nskeptics assert that no discovery can be made; Pyrrhonists carry on\ninvestigating and searching for the truth (I 3). (For the sincerity of\nthis last claim, see Palmer 2000 and Perin 2006.) This, continues\nSextus, is why Skeptics get their name (I 7): \u2018to\ninvestigate\u2019 in Greek is skeptesthai, and so\nskeptikos means something like \u2018one who is disposed to\ninvestigate\u2019, \u2018investigator\u2019.\n\n\nIf Pyrrhonian Skeptics are still investigating any matter you like,\nthere is no distinctive set of beliefs which mark them out as a school.\nAmongst the things Platonists believe is the proposition that the only\ntruly real things are Forms (and their discovery of this is what their\ninvestigation into the question \u2018what is there?\u2019 culminated\nin), and amongst the things Aristotelians believe is the proposition\nthat the soul is the actuality of the living body as such (and their\ndiscovery of this is what their investigation into the question\n\u2018what is the soul?\u2019 culminated in). Holding these beliefs\nis partially constitutive of what it is to be an Aristotelian or a\nPlatonist. Skeptics have not yet found answers to those questions,\nbecause they are still investigating them. It follows that to be a\nSkeptic is not to subscribe to a set of beliefs in the way that members\nof the other Philosophical Schools do. Yet there must be something\nabout them that makes them count as Skeptics. What, then, is\nSkepticism? Sextus\u2019 answer is that it is an ability or skill (I\n8), not a set of beliefs. \n \nSextus presents scepticism as a kind\nof philosophy, distinguished from others not by the content of its\ndoctrines (there are none), but apparently by its attitude to\nphilosophical problems and theses. (Striker 2001: 114; cf.\nMorison 2011: 265\u20139)\n3.2 What is the Skeptical ability or skill?\n\n\nScepticism is an ability to set out oppositions among things\nwhich appear and are thought of in any way at all, an ability by which,\nbecause of the equipollence in the opposed objects and accounts, we\ncome first to suspension of judgment and afterwards to\ntranquillity. (I 8)\n\nSextus tells us that the distinctively\nSkeptical ability is the one which enables its possessor to set out\noppositions of such a sort that suspension of judgment ensues\n(tranquillity, we learn later, will follow \n\u2018fortuitously\u2019\u2014see 3.3 below).\n The sort of opposition which will achieve this\nis one where \u2018none of the conflicting accounts takes precedence\nover any other as being more convincing\u2019 (I 10) (this is the\nelucidation of \u2018equipollent\u2019). So, a Skeptic is someone who\nhas the ability to find, for any given argument in favour of a\nproposition P, a conflicting argument (i.e., one whose conclusion is a\nproposition which cannot be true together with P\u2014call it P*)\nwhich is equally convincing.\n\n\nThis connects with investigation in the following way: when one\ninvestigates whether P, one assembles arguments or\nconsiderations in favour of P, and arguments or considerations\nagainst (i.e., arguments whose conclusions conflict with\nP). One assesses whether P or not-P on the basis\nof weighing up these arguments, and seeing which side carries more\nweight:\n\n \nYou pursue an inquiry insofar as you draw up\npossible solutions to the problem it addresses, consider what reasons\nmight be adduced in favour of the different solutions, and attempt to\nassess the force of those reasons in order to pick out the correct\nsolution. (Barnes 2000: xx)\n \nNote then that \u2018x suspends judgment as to whether\nP\u2019 does not merely mean that x neither\nbelieves P nor believes that not-P. For if P is a\nproposition that x has never given any thought to, then it\nmight be true that x neither believes P nor believes\nthat not-P. President Obama neither believes that my mother\u2019s\nname is \u2018Judith\u2019 nor believes that it isn\u2019t, but he is not\na skeptic about whether my mother\u2019s name is \u2018Judith\u2019. To\ncount as suspending judgment (in the Skeptic\u2019s sense) whether\nP, it is at least necessary to have given the question whether\nP some thought. As Barnes 2000: xix, puts it: \n x is sceptical with regard to the proposition\nthat P if and only if (i) x has considered whether or\nnot P, and (ii) x does not believe that P, and\n(iii) x does not believe that not-P.\n\n Note further that Sextus \n \nassembles arguments\nin favour of an affirmative answer, and arguments in favour of a\nnegative answer. The two sets of arguments exactly balance one\nanother. \n\u1f18\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \n[suspension of judgment] supervenes\u2014\u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \ndirected towards the\nproposition that P. (Barnes 1982: 59)\n \nThis means that\nconsidering whether or not P requires that one consider both sides\nof the question whether P, i.e., that one considers arguments in\nfavour of P and arguments in favour of not-P (or, more generally, of\nsomething incompatible with P; see PH I 10). It would\nnot be enough, for instance, to look at one argument in favour of P and\nthen reject that argument as invalid; while doing so would indeed leave\none neither believing P nor not-P (assuming one had no further evidence\neither way), one would not have considered both sides of the\nquestion, since one would not yet have considered any arguments in\nfavour of not-P. (This condition will be important later when we\nconsider the Modes of Skepticism\u2014see below, 3.5.2.)\n3.3 Tranquillity\n\n\nHow does it come about that someone acquires the skeptical skill?\nSextus offers an answer in PH I 12. People have become\nSkeptics because they are seeking tranquillity. Certain people\n(\u2018men of talent\u2019 in Annas and Barnes\u2019 translation;\n\u2018smart and energetic people\u2019 in Cooper\u2019s nice gloss\n(2012: 282)) are \u2018troubled by the anomaly in things\u2019 (I 12)\nand want to take away this \u2018trouble\u2019, i.e., become tranquil\n(the word translated \u2018tranquillity\u2019 is etymologically\nrelated to the word translated \u2018trouble\u2019, and more\nliterally means \u2018lack of trouble\u2019). Presumably Sextus has\nin mind that one might be troubled by the various discrepancies that\nthe world offers, such as this one (taken from PH III 202):\n\u2018among us, tattooing is thought to be shameful and a dishonour,\nbut many Egyptians and Sarmatians tattoo their babies\u2019. By\nconsidering these two facts, one has both the impression that tattooing\nis bad and the impression that it is good: those who pay attention to\nsuch anomalies will be \u2018puzzled as to which of them they should\nrather assent to\u2019 (PH I 12 again). So begins the quest\nfor finding the answer and ridding oneself of the irksome\n\u2018trouble\u2019 that such questions induce. Sextus seems to be\nexplaining how it is that someone could come to be investigating\nquestions with the sort of single-mindedness the skeptic has, a\nsingle-mindedness which results in the intense scrutiny of all sides of\na question. This will in turn explain how it is that anyone would\nend up with the skeptical skill: this intense scrutiny will lead the\nscrutiniser to develop skill at coming up with considerations speaking\nto both sides of a question and evaluating them for convincingness.\n\n\n(For a slightly different take on what Sextus is up to in PH\nI 12, see Cooper 2012, who interprets Sextus as telling us about his\n\u2018original skeptic predecessors\u2019 (283) or\n\u2018proto-skeptics\u2019 (285), who came upon the skeptical skill\nas a result of their reflections, \u2018as something then for later\nworriers to avail themselves of\u2019 (282 n.76). In other words,\nSextus is primarily offering\n\u2018a narrative history of the\nexperiences of those who became the first to practice the skeptic\nphilosophy\u2019 (288), rather than an account of how anyone at any\ntime might find themselves becoming a skeptic.)\n\n\nSo if we are smart and energetic we seek intellectual tranquillity, or\nfreedom from the troubles which come from being assailed by the many\ncontradictions the world seems to offer. Sextus elaborates further in\nPH I 25\u201330 that \u2018the aim of the Skeptic is\ntranquillity in matters of opinion\u2019 (I 26). But whereas to begin\nwith, \u2018Skeptics were hoping to acquire tranquillity by deciding\nthe anomalies in what appears and is thought of\u2019 (I 29), they\nfound themselves unable to settle the questions they were\ninvestigating and ended up suspending judgment (because of their\nSkeptical skill). But rather than this making them even more troubled,\nthey discovered\u2014to their surprise\u2014that in fact\ntranquillity followed after all! They did not find the answers they\nhad been looking for, because the Skeptical skill will preclude you\nfrom finding such answers; nonetheless, tranquillity did ensue. Sextus\nillustrates this fortuitousness with a story about Apelles the\npainter: \n \nhe was\npainting a horse and wanted to represent in his picture the lather on\nthe horse\u2019s mouth; but he was so unsuccessful that he gave up,\ntook the sponge on which he had been wiping off the colours from his\nbrush, and flung it at the picture. And when it hit the picture, it\nproduced a representation of the horse\u2019s lather.\n(PH I 28)\n \nYou search for tranquillity, and it will come, just\nnot in the way you were expecting. More succinctly, Sextus says that\ntranquillity follows suspension of judgment \u2018as a shadow follows\na body\u2019 (I 29; for the same image, cf. DL IX 107). The idea behind the shadow image seems to\nbe that tranquillity will indeed follow suspension of judgment, but it\nis not the thing you were expecting. So, burning with curiosity, you\nengage in the investigation whether P, expecting to find tranquillity\nwhen you discover whether P; you end up not discovering whether P but\nrather suspending judgment whether P, and much to your surprise,\ntranquillity still follows. Striker finds in Sextus\u2019 imagery the\nmessage that \u2018Skeptical tranquillity can only be reached if one\ndoes not try for it\u2019 (1990a: 193).\n\n\nWill being a Pyrrhonian Skeptic bring you tranquillity, as Sextus\nadvertises? Two objections have been brought against it.\n\n\n(1) Striker (1990a) argues that Sextus is guilty of an inconsistency.\nSextus obviously does not think there is such a thing as the goal of\nlife (no self-respecting Pyrrhonian Skeptic could have such a\ntheoretically loaded view). But then how can Sextus talk consistently\nof the goal of the Skeptic being tranquillity?\n\nSuch is the\npenalty of arguing, on the one hand, that there is no such thing as a\ngoal of life [\u2026], and on the other, that Pyrrhonism is the only\nway to it. (Striker 1990a: 193)\n\nStriker\u2019s charge might be\noverstretched, since Sextus would characterise himself as\nsuspending judgment over the question whether there is a goal\nof life (rather than as rejecting that there is such a thing),\nbut the tension she points to still remains. Additionally, Striker\nargues against Sextus that there is a psychologically crucial\ningredient in tranquillity that is missing from the Pyrrhonist\u2019s\nversion, namely \u2018the thought that one has or can easily get all\nthe goods one might need\u2019 (ibid). That thought is missing because\nof course the Skeptic does not have any beliefs about what is good or\nbad, and indeed Sextus himself touts Pyrrhonism as having the advantage\nover other philosophies, and over the belief systems of ordinary\npeople, that Pyrrhonists\n\nshed the additional opinion that each\nof these things [sc. feelings such as hunger, thirst, etc. that we\ncannot avoid in virtue of being human] is bad in its nature.\n(PH I 30; cf. Frede 1979: 22)\n\n This prompted Striker to\nconclude: \n \nThe Pyrrhonists would have done better, I believe, to\nstay out of the competition for guides to the happy life, and limit\nthemselves to the field of epistemology. (1990a: 193)\n \nPerhaps,\nthough, the tranquillity that Sextus promises is only supposed to be\nintellectual tranquillity, freedom from the trouble or anxiety that\nhaving an unanswered question in your life brings. It can\u2019t\npromise you freedom from your back pain or an irrational fear of\ndeath.\n\n\n(2) Myles Burnyeat raises a different objection to Sextus\u2019 claim that\nthe Skeptic will find tranquillity: \n\nataraxia is hardly to be attained if he is not in some sense\nsatisfied\u2014so far\u2014that no answers are forthcoming, that\ncontrary claims are indeed equal. (1980: 56) \n In other words, in order to settle back into intellectual\ntranquillity, the Skeptic must have some belief along these lines: no\nenquiry will ever produce an answer. He must become a global skeptic,\nand not just a local one. However, in the opening sentences of\nPH Sextus seems to preclude the possibility that Pyrrhonian\nskeptics espouse such a global belief in the impossibility of\ndiscovery when he contrasts the Pyrrhonian Skeptics, who\n\u2018are still investigating\u2019, with other, dogmatic, skeptics,\nwho hold that the truth \u2018cannot be apprehended\u2019\n(PH I 2). And quite apart from the apparent unavailability of\nthis particular belief to the Skeptic, there is also the general worry\nthat the Skeptic has no beliefs whatsoever (thus precluding him from\nbelieving that no enquiry will ever produce an answer). It is to this\nquestion that we shall turn next. But note that if it turns out that\nthe Skeptic can have beliefs, and that the belief that no\nenquiry will ever produce an answer is one of the beliefs available to\nthe skeptic, then we might be able to answer Burnyeat\u2019s objection (for\nmore on this see below, 3.6).\n3.4 Does the Skeptic have any beliefs?\n\n\nSince Skeptics spend their time taking the dogmatists to task for\nsettling on their beliefs too quickly and not persevering in their\nenquiries, it is a natural question to wonder whether the Skeptics\nthemselves have any beliefs\u2014if so, they seem open to the very\ncharges they level at the dogmatists. There are two ways in which the\nSkeptics might appear to have beliefs. First, they offer a wealth of\ncounterarguments to the positions of the dogmatists. Where the\ndogmatists argue that P, the Skeptic argues that not-P. It can easily\nappear that the Skeptic is in fact endorsing the conclusion, i.e., that\nhe holds that not-P on the basis of those arguments. But we should\ndistinguish between two cases of arguing something, say, C:\non the one hand, offering an argument with conclusion C and endorsing C, and on the other,\noffering an argument with conclusion C and letting the argument\nstand as a counter-argument to an argument with the opposite\nconclusion. Presumably, the Skeptic is doing the second. Still,\nyou can see how the misunderstanding might have arisen (for more on\nthis, see section 4.2 below). A second way the Skeptics might appear\nto have beliefs is that they went about their everyday lives in the way\nwe all do, eating, drinking, sleeping, and avoiding oncoming wagons and\ndangerous-looking dogs, etc.\u2014surely to act in this way requires\nhaving beliefs about the way the world is? This was a common charge\nlevelled against the Skeptics by their opponents in antiquity (see Vogt\n1998: 2010).\n\n\nSextus turns to the question of whether the skeptic has any beliefs\nin a very famous\u2014and much debated\u2014passage, PH\nI 13 (in Annas and Barnes\u2019 translation):\n\n\n\nWhen we say that Skeptics do not hold beliefs, we do not take\n\u2018belief\u2019 in the sense in which some say, quite generally,\nthat belief is acquiescing in something; for Skeptics assent to the\nfeelings forced upon them by appearances\u2014for example, they\nwould not say, when heated or chilled, \u2018I think I am not heated\n(or: chilled)\u2019. Rather, we say that they do not hold beliefs in\nthe sense in which some say that belief is assent to some unclear\nobject of investigation in the sciences; for Pyrrhonists do not assent\nto anything unclear.\n\n\n\nThe question of how to interpret this little paragraph, and thus\nsettle the question of whether the Skeptic has any beliefs, is the\nquestion that much contemporary scholarship concerning Sextus has\nfocussed on (see for instance the papers collected in Burnyeat and\nFrede 1997; with Fine 2000; Barnes 2007; Perin 2010b), yet there does\nnot seem to be a consensus.\n3.4.1 Yes, the Skeptic has beliefs\n\n\nIn 1979, Michael Frede argued that \n\n\nthe sceptics thought that\neven if one suspended judgment on all matters, at least suspended\njudgment in the sense in which they recommend that one suspend\njudgment, one would still have many beliefs and views, quite enough, at\nany rate, to lead a worthwhile life. (Frede 1979: 3) \n\n\nFrede\ntook himself to be arguing against what he terms the \u2018usual\ninterpretation of Pyrrhonian scepticism\u2019, namely that the Skeptic\n\u2018has no view or beliefs about anything\u2019 (1). Frede argues\nthat in PH I 13, \n  \nSextus distinguishes between a wider\n(koinoteron) and a narrower sense of \u2018belief\u2019; and\nonly beliefs in the narrower sense count as dogmatic. (8\u20139)\n  \n So\nconfident is Frede of this analysis that he concludes: \n  \nthere can\nbe no doubt whatsoever that, according to Sextus, a serious Pyrrhonean\nskeptic can have beliefs. (9)\n\n\nThe question for Frede is how to understand what Sextus says in I 13\nwhen he characterizes the first kind of belief\n(dogma) which he says the skeptics can have. Frede argues that\nwhat is meant is that the Skeptic \n  \naccepts the judgment of\nphantasia; at least, he raises no objection against its\nverdict; if it says things are thus or thus, he does not challenge\nthis. (18)\n  \n(Phantasia here refers to the faculty of our\nsoul which produces in us impressions of how things are. In PH\nI 13, Sextus says that Skeptics assent to \u2018the feelings forced\nupon them by appearances\u2019; one could also translate this as\nfollows: \u2018the feelings forced upon them by an exercise of\nphantasia\u2019.) In other words, the Skeptic, like everyone,\nhas impressions which represent the world as being a certain way, and\nthese are forced upon the Skeptic, so there is no avoiding\nthem, and these impressions in turn have a certain pull which inclines\nthe Skeptic to assent to them and which he does not counteract. Texts\nsuch as I 13, I 22, and I 29\u201330 emphasize that the impressions are\nforced on us. Other texts emphasize that impressions bring with them a\npull which is sufficient to cause assent, e.g., I 19: \n  \nwe do not\noverturn anything which leads us, without our willing it, to\nassent in accordance with a passive appearance,\n  \n or I 193:\n  \nwe do yield to things which passively move us and lead us\nnecessarily to assent\u2019 (my emphases).\n\n\nThe second kind of belief referred to in I 13, the kind which the\nSkeptic cannot have, is a belief which Frede characterizes as one which\n\u2018involve[s] an assumption or claim about one of the nonevident\nobjects of scientific inquiry \u2019 (18).\n These beliefs are not forced\nupon one, but arise through the rational weighing up of evidence on\neither side of a question. Frede\u2019s (and Sextus\u2019)\ncharacterization of these beliefs as being \u2018about one of the\nnonevident objects of scientific enquiry\u2019 might make it seem as\nthough it is beliefs with a certain content that will not be\nentertained by the skeptic, but in fact Frede has something different\nin mind: \n\n \nAs far as the second part of our passage is concerned,\nit says only that the sceptic may not have beliefs of a certain kind,\nviz., philosophical or scientific ones which depend on reasoned\ngrounds. (19)\n \nThus, \n \n[a]ny belief, whatever its content\nmay be, can be a dogmatic belief; conversely, every belief can be an\nundogmatic one. (ibid)\n \n Roughly speaking, Frede is proposing that\nthe difference between the kinds of belief a Skeptic can have and the\nones the Skeptic cannot have is a difference in the way the beliefs are\nformed. If the belief that p has been formed \u2018on\nreasoned grounds\u2019\u2014\u2018as a result of marshalling\narguments or considerations in favour of p\u2019 (Morison\n2011: 266), or perhaps as a result of simply thinking that there are\nsuch grounds without having yet marshalled them\u2014then this\nbelief counts as a belief of the sort the Skeptic cannot have, and if\nthe belief that p has been formed not on the basis of the\nmarshalling of arguments, but just because that is how things strike\nthe person who forms the belief, then this belief counts as a belief of\nthe sort the Skeptic can have. (See Perin 2010a and b for doubts about\nwhether this interpretation can be extracted from Sextus\u2019\ntext.)\n[See the supplementary document Interpreting Frede.]\n\n\n\nExamples of the kind of belief the Skeptic could have, following\nFrede\u2019s interpretation, are ones such as the following:\n\n(a) The belief that it is day outside, where this\nbelief is formed immediately from the perceptual appearance to you that\nit is day outside. Contrast: someone believing that it is day\noutside on the basis of performing a calculation about the sun\u2019s\nposition at that precise time relative to their position on the earth\n(Morison 2011: 267). Or again, contrast someone who believes that it is\nday outside because they run through an argument such as this in their\nheads: my senses are reliable; it appears right now to my senses that\nit is day outside; therefore it must be day.\n\n(b) The belief that 1+1=2, where this belief is formed as a\nresult of it just striking your intellect that 1+1=2. Contrast:\nbelieving that 1+1=2 as a result of running through the proof in\nPrincipia Mathematica.\n The belief that you should eat something right now,\nwhere this belief is formed immediately from the feeling you have\nof being hungry. Contrast: someone, an athlete perhaps, who weighs\nup the pros and cons of having something to eat now, and decides that\nthey should, because on balance, the pros outweigh the cons.\nThe belief that the Stoic God exists, where this\nbelief is formed simply from acculturation; \u2018imagine someone\nwho has been raised by the Stoics and who thus has the Stoic concept of\nGod\u2019 (Frede 1979: 23). Contrast: a philosopher who believes that\nthe Stoic God exists, formed as a result of running through and\naccepting the proofs the Stoics give of the existence of this sort of\nGod.\nThe belief that you should make the table in this way,\nwhere this belief is formed from your craft-experience.\nImagine the apprentice carpenter who simply follows the example set by\nhis teacher, without actually holding that the way his teacher does\nthings is the correct one. Or perhaps you make the table this way just\nbecause every time you have made a table this way it has stayed\nupright. Contrast: the master-carpenter who has an account of why\npieces of wood stick together better this way than any other way, and\nwho believes on this basis that you should make the table this way\naccordingly.\n\n\n\nThese examples are deliberately chosen in order to reflect the\nfourfold sources of appearances guiding our actions that Sextus relates\nin PH I 21\u201324, which Frede will take to be a fourfold source\nof beliefs open to the Skeptic, providing him with the wherewithal to\nlead an ordinary life: \n  \nBy nature\u2019s guidance we are\nnaturally capable of perceiving and thinking. By the necessitation of\nfeelings, hunger conducts us to food and thirst to drink. By the\nhanding down of customs and laws, we accept, from an everyday point of\nview, that piety is good and impiety bad. By teaching of kinds of\nexpertise we are not inactive in those expertises which we\naccept. (I 24)\n  \n Frede\u2019s interpretation provides a neat way\nto sidestep the traditional charge levelled against the Pyrrhonian\nSkeptics, namely that they will not be able to lead a recognisably\nhuman life, thanks to their suspension of judgment on all matters. The\ntrick is to see that the Skeptics can hold beliefs, but just in an\nordinary everyday way (\u2018from an everyday point of view,\u2019 as he\nsays in the passage above), i.e., not as a result of marshalling\narguments and evidence in favour of those beliefs, as philosophers and\nscientists do.\n\n\nMany other texts in Sextus suggest that in fact, the Pyrrhonian\nSkeptic does have beliefs. Here are some. \n \nwe\naccept\n(\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd),\nfrom an everyday point of view, that piety is good and impiety\nbad (PH I 24).\nwe accept\n(\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd)\nthat there\nare such things as numbers (PH III 151).\n\nin line\nwith his [sc. the skeptic\u2019s] ancestral customs and laws, he says\n(\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd)\nthat there are gods and does\neverything that tends to worship of and reverence towards\nthem (M IX 49).\n\nBut in fact we ourselves judge\n(\u1f14\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd) this way, assuming fire\nfrom smoke, a previous wound from a scar, death from previous trauma to\nthe heart, and oil from a previous headband (M VIII 157).\n\n3.4.2 No, the Skeptic doesn\u2019t have beliefs\n\n\nFrede\u2019s proposal was rejected by Jonathan Barnes and Myles\nBurnyeat, who argued that Pyrrhonian Skepticism involves rejecting\nall beliefs. Barnes followed Galen in using the term\n\u2018rustic\u2019 for the skeptic who rejects every belief, and\ncoined the term \u2018urbane\u2019 for the kind of skeptic Frede\ndescribes, the one whose skepticism still allows him to have beliefs\n(Barnes 1982: 61). One challenge for these interpreters who think\nSextus is a rustic skeptic is to explain how the type of dogma\nthat the skeptic does allow himself in I 13 won\u2019t count as a\nbelief. According to Burnyeat, what is going on when the Skeptic\nassents in accordance with the appearances is that he is merely\n\u2018acknowledging that this is indeed how the thing appears to one\nat the moment\u2019 (Burnyeat 1980: 43); but Skeptics and dogmatists\ndispute \u2018whether any proposition or class of propositions can be\naccepted as true of a real objective world as distinct from mere\nappearance\u2019 (30). \u2018Statements which record how things\nappear cannot be described as true or false\u2019 (31), since\n\n  \nthe true, if there is such a thing, is what conforms with the\nreal, an association traditional to the word alethes since the\nearliest period of Greek philosophy. (30)\n  \nHence the\npronouncements of the Skeptic that things appear thus-and-so do not\nrepresent the beliefs of the Skeptic as to how things are, but only\nrecord how things appear to him.\n\n\nJonathan Barnes has a slightly different interpretation of the\npronouncements of the Skeptic: when the Skeptic sees the tower in the\ndistance and it appears round to him, he \n\nmay utter the sentence\n\u201cThe tower seems round\u201d: he thereby expresses his\n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, but he does not state that\nhe is experiencing a certain \n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2\n(he does not state anything at all). (1982: 66; his emphases)\n\nWhat\nis the Skeptic doing, then, if he is not stating anything? He is\navowing something: \n  \nit is plain that avowals and\nconfessions were supposed by the Pyrrhonists to be speech acts of a\ndifferent kind from statements or affirmations. (65)\n  \nHis avowals\n\u2018express \n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\nand do not evince beliefs\u2019\n(66). His pronouncement is like saying \u2018ouch!\u2019: one\ndoes not express one\u2019s belief that one is in pain in\nsaying \u2018ouch!\u2019, but rather one simply expresses one\u2019s\npain (ibid).\n\n\nBarnes and Burnyeat have the same goal: to deny that any utterances\nthe Skeptic makes which have the form \u2018X appears F\u2019 commit\nthe Skeptic to having any beliefs. In other words, they attempt to show\nthat assenting to the \u2018feelings forced upon them by\nappearances\u2019 (I 13) need not involve having a belief in our sense\nof the term (even though Sextus says that this is a way of having a\ndogma). It is important to see that Barnes and Burnyeat do not\narrive at this position by interpreting I 13 alone; rather they have an\nargument that the Skeptic can\u2019t have any beliefs, and\nthey interpret I 13 in the light of that. That argument is sketched\nbelow (section 4.1), since it turns on the use they make of\nSextus\u2019 discussion of the criterion of truth (which occupies a\nlarge part of PH II and all of M VII).\n\n\nWhat do Barnes and Burnyeat say about the kind of life the Skeptic\nleads? How can the Skeptic respond to the charge that he cannot lead a\nrecognisably human life unless he has beliefs? Barnes 1982: 79\u201389\nattempts an interpretation of PH I 21\u20134 according to which the\nfourfold observances of everyday life don\u2019t commit the Skeptic to\nany beliefs whatsoever: hunger and thirst \u2018alone suffice to drive\nthe Skeptic\u2014like any other man or animal\u2014to food and\ndrink\u2019 (82); \n\n  \nTeaching a man medicine\u2026 is like\ntraining him to ride: you are attempting to impart a power or\nskill to him; you are not trying to give him any\nbeliefs;  (83)\n  \nthe Skeptic \u2018drives on the right\nbecause that is the custom\u2014not because he believes that it is\nthe custom\u2019 (84); etc.\n\n\nMany texts in Sextus suggest that the Skeptic does not have any\nbeliefs. Here are some. \n\n The chief constitutive\nprinciple of Skepticism is the claim that to every account an equal\naccount is opposed; for it is from this, we think, that we come to hold\nno beliefs (\u03bc\u1f74 \u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd) (PH I 12).\n in uttering these phrases [the Skeptical\nphrases: see below 3.6] they say what is apparent to themselves and\nreport their own feelings without holding opinions\n(\u1f00\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2),\naffirming nothing about external objects (PH I 15).\nwe say all this [i.e., about the fourfold sources of appearances\ngoverning actions, listed in PH I 21\u20134] without holding any\nopinions\n(\u1f00\u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2)\n(PH I 24).\n\n3.4.3 Yes again.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting another position that some scholars have\ntaken: when Skeptics acknowledge that things appear thus-and-so to\nthem, they quite simply do have beliefs, namely \u2018beliefs about\nthe ways things appear to him to be\u2019 (Perin 2010b: 161, following Fine\n2000: 104). The skeptic does indeed have beliefs: Burnyeat was wrong to\nsay that acknowledging that things appear to you thus-and-so is not a\nway of holding something to be true, and Barnes was wrong to try to\ndodge the commitments the skeptic incurs when he utters sentences such\nas \u2018honey seems sweet to me\u2019, by talking of avowals.\nRather, Perin and Fine argue, the skeptic has exactly the belief you\nwould expect, given that he says things like \u2018honey seems sweet\nto me\u2019: the belief that things appear thus-and-so to him\n(in this instance, the belief that honey appears sweet to\nhim). It is important to note that the beliefs such interpreters\nattribute to the Skeptics are nothing like the beliefs that\nFrede\u2019s interpretation allows to the Skeptic. Frede\u2019s\nposition allows the Skeptic to have ordinary beliefs such as \u2018it\nis day outside\u2019, \u2018I am hungry\u2019, \u2018the library\ncloses at 6.00 p.m.\u2019, etc., whereas the interpreters under\ndiscussion allow to the Skeptic only beliefs such as \u2018it\nseems to be daytime outside\u2019, \u2018I feel\nhungry\u2019, \u2018the library appears to close at 6.00\np.m.\u2019, etc.\n\n\nSome texts in Sextus suggest the Fine/Perin view. Here is one.\nPH I 19\u201320 (in the Annas and Barnes translation): \n\n When we investigate whether existing things are such\nas they appear, we grant\n(\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd)\nthat they appear, and what we investigate is not what is apparent but\nwhat is said about what is apparent\u2014and this is different from\ninvestigating what is apparent itself. For example, it appears to us\nthat honey sweetens (we concede\n(\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd)\nthis inasmuch as we are sweetened in a perceptual\nway).\n3.4.4 An assessment\n\n\nHere is PH I 13 again:\n\n\nWhen we say that Skeptics do not hold beliefs, we do not take\n\u2018belief\u2019 in the sense in which some say, quite generally,\nthat belief is acquiescing in something; for Skeptics assent to the\nfeelings forced upon them by appearances\u2014for example, they\nwould not say, when heated or chilled, \u2018I think I am not heated\n(or: chilled)\u2019. Rather, we say that they do not hold beliefs in\nthe sense in which some say that belief is assent to some unclear\nobject of investigation in the sciences; for Pyrrhonists do not assent\nto anything unclear.\n\n\n[See the supplementary document The example from PH I 13.]\n\n\n\nThe way to make progress is to see how the three interpretations\nsketched in (3.4.1)\u2013(3.4.3) differ in the way they interpret the phrase\n\u2018Skeptics assent to the feelings forced upon them by\nappearances\u2019 in PH I 13. The \u2018feelings\u2019 in\nquestion are the states (path\u00ea) that the faculty of\nphantasia puts one in when it represents the world as being a\ncertain way (so when my faculty of phantasia represents the\nworld as being one in which P, I am thereby in the state of being\nappeared to that P). When X is in that state, X has the impression\nor appearance that P. The question which concerns us is this: what does\nit mean to assent to this feeling, i.e., this impression or appearance?\nAccording to Frede, assenting to this feeling is a matter of\nbelieving the world to be as the state represents it as being.\nOr, more punchily, assenting to the feeling forced upon one by\nappearances entails accepting the content of that state. For\nBarnes and Burnyeat, to assent to the appearance that P is a matter of\nacknowledging that one is in the state of being appeared to that P.\nWhat gets acknowledged or accepted is that one is in that mental\nstate, not the content of the state. Both Barnes and\nBurnyeat think that to make such an acknowledgment does not amount to\nhaving a belief\u2014it\u2019s just an acknowledgment that one is\nin a certain internal state. Fine and Perin agree with Barnes and\nBurnyeat that the Skeptics acknowledge that they are in a certain\nmental state (rather than accepting the content of the state),\nbut Fine and Perin are prepared to say that the skeptic does thereby\nbelieves something, namely that it appears to him that P, and that this\nbelief is the only kind of dogma the Skeptic has.\n\n\nIn deciding this debate, one has to keep two issues apart (see e.g.,\nFine 2000: 81). One is how to interpret Sextus\u2019 characterisation\nof the kind of dogma which is acceptable to the skeptic (does\nit involve accepting that one is in a certain mental state, or is it an\nacceptance of the way the world is, etc.); the other is whether a\ndogma of the acceptable kind deserves to be called a\nbelief, given what that English term connotes. The second of\nthese points is a matter of philosophical definition, but the first is\na properly interpretational dispute. Barnes and Burnyeat claim that the\nacceptable kind of dogma, on their analysis, is not a belief\nin any acceptable sense of the word \u2018belief\u2019: for me to\nacknowledge that I am currently having a perceptual experience of a\ntree outside my window (to acknowledge that it appears to me that there\nis a tree outside) is no way of believing that there is a tree\noutside. Striker points out that this is not so obvious, since\naccording to Barnes and Burnyeat, the Skeptic\u2019s actions are\ngoverned by these acknowledgments, and there is \n\na much weaker,\ndispositional sense [sc. of the word \u2018belief\u2019], according\nto which it is sufficient for the ascription of a belief to an agent if\nshe acts or behaves in a certain way. (Striker 2001: 119)\n\nHence she is\ninclined to think \u2018it is a matter of terminological choice\nwhether we want to speak of belief here or not\u2019 (ibid). In other\nwords, given the Barnes/Burnyeat interpretation of what a\ndogma is, she thinks it is a matter of terminological choice\nwhether we call it a \u2018belief\u2019. But what we are interested\nin here is the larger question of just what it means to have a\ndogma of the acceptable kind.\n\n\nSo who is right about what the acceptable kind of dogma is?\nWho is right about the interpretation of the phrase \u2018Skeptics\nassent to the feelings forced upon them by appearances\u2019?\nPresumably Sextus intends us to understand the phrase in the light of\nits philosophical background. Frede claims: \n\n\u201cassenting to\nsuch impressions\u201d cannot mean \u201cassenting to the claim that\none is affected in this way, that one has such\nimpressions\u201d (1979: 20),\n\n thereby flatly denying the\ninterpretation of Barnes and Burnyeat. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t\nsay why the phrase cannot mean this. But his reason is not hard to\nfind. Sextus is using Stoic terminology and is deliberately casting the\nissue using Stoic terms. And for the Stoics, to assent to the\nimpression that P is a matter of judging that P:\n  \nTo accept or\ngive assent to a thought or impression is to have the belief that the\nproposition which forms the content of the impression is true. (Frede\n1983: 153)\n  \nThe issue is thoroughly uncontroversial in Stoic\nscholarship; see, for instance, Sandbach 1975: 88: \n\n  \nThe man may\nsay \u2018There appears to be an apple, and I assent: there is an\napple\u2019.\n \n (For the same diagnosis of Frede\u2019s train of\nthought, see Fine 2000: 101.) The point is that no one reading Sextus\u2019 text in the\nlight of the philosophical usage of the terms he uses would think that\nassenting to the impression that P meant anything other than\nbelieving that P. Specifically, no one would think that it\nmeant acknowledging or judging that one has the impression that\nP. So purely as a matter of philosophical usage, to talk of\nassenting to an impression that P, as Sextus does, requires us to\nunderstand that assent as the having of a belief that P. (Note that\nthis is not a linguistic point about the Stoics\u2019 use of the word\ndogma, since they don\u2019t use that word in these contexts,\nbut rather a philosophical point about what assenting to an impression\nmust amount to for the Stoics.) If this is right, then philosophical\nphilology alone rules out the reading that Burnyeat and Barnes and\nPerin and Fine want. (For a different view on the origins of\nSextus\u2019 language in PH I 13, but one which arrives at\nthe same conclusion, see Barney 1992.)\n\n\nIn I 13, Sextus gives two senses of the verb translated \u2018to\nhave beliefs\u2019\n(\u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd),\nand he does so by means of distinguishing two meanings of the word\n\u2018belief\u2019\n(\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1). One meaning is\nbroader (koinoteron) than the other. So the first meaning\nshould encompass the second. Sextus clearly intends this to be so: in\nthe first sense of dogma, a dogma is assent to\nanything, and in the second sense it is assent to a certain\nsubclass of things (\u2018some unclear object of\ninvestigation in the sciences\u2019). In arguing that the Skeptic has\ndogmata in the first sense, Sextus simply needs to show that\nthe Skeptic does assent to something. And this he does by\ntelling us which things the Skeptic assents to: he assents to the\n\u2018feelings forced upon him by appearances\u2019. When Sextus says\nwhat it is that the Skeptics don\u2019t assent to, we are\ntold that it is the \u2018unclear objects of investigation in the\nsciences\u2019. If it\u2019s right that the talk of assenting to\nimpressions is Stoic, then it could sound as though here Sextus is\ntalking about assent to a different kind of thing here, something more\nlike a proposition. It could sound as if Sextus means to differentiate\nbetween the type of thing that the Skeptic assents to\n(appearances) and the type of thing he doesn\u2019t assent to (objects\nof investigation, i.e., propositions). Indeed, it may be that this lies\nbehind the interpretations of Barnes, Burnyeat, Perin, and Fine: what\nthe Skeptic can assent to are his own impressions, but not to matters\nof fact! But on closer inspection, Sextus does describe the object of\nthis second kind of assent in epistemological or psychological terms:\nthe forbidden kind of dogma involves assenting to\n\u2018unclear objects of investigation in the\nsciences\u2019. So it is not difficult to put this in terms of\nimpressions: Sextus is saying that the forbidden kind of dogma\ninvolves assenting to impressions which are not clear. Why should the\nimpressions garnered during the course of an investigation in the\nsciences be unclear? For a Pyrrhonist such as Sextus, the answer is\nobvious: any impression that P which comes to him during his\ninvestigation will be counterbalanced by an impression that not-P (or\nsome other conflicting impression). These impressions or appearances do\nnot carry with them any pull because they are always countermanded by\nanother equal and opposite impression. Thus, to assent to one of these\nimpressions is to go beyond appearances; it is no longer a matter of\nresponding, passively and without an act of the will, to the weight or\npull of the appearances, but rather a matter of going beyond how things\nappear; in such cases, one\u2019s assent is instead dictated by certain theoretical\ncommitments one has (or, more broadly, by one\u2019s accepting something as a reason for assenting to the non-apparent thing). \n\n\nVerdict: the Skeptic does have beliefs. He assents to certain\nappearances, namely those that aren\u2019t accompanied by equal and\nopposing appearances. When he assents to those appearances, he is not\nendorsing them as being the correct ones in the light of this or that\ntheory, or in the light of this or that reason for assenting, but merely passively responding to their pull. In I 13 Sextus\ndresses this point up in Stoic garb, presumably in order to send the\nmessage that the Stoics have to acknowledge the existence of the kinds\nof belief the Skeptic has. And the examples of beliefs that the Skeptic\nwould end up with are indeed the ones that Frede gives, such as me\nbelieving now that it is day, on the basis of having a (perceptual)\nimpression that it is light outside, an impression which is not\ncountermanded by any countervailing impressions and which exerts a pull\nall of its own towards assent.\n[See the supplementary document\n Revisiting the texts which appeared to support interpretations 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.]\n\n\n\nThus, the weight of evidence seems to favour the Frede\ninterpretation (although sometimes it can also seem as though the\nrational thing to do is to suspend judgment in the face of these\nequally strong competing interpretations).\n3.5 Modes\n\n\nBy far the longest single discussion in PH I concerns the\nmodes of Skepticism (I 31\u2013186) (see Annas and Barnes 1985; Barnes\n1990a,b; Striker 1993; Hankinson 1995: chapters 9 and 10; Perin\n2006: 354\u20138; Woodruff 2010; Morison 2011, 2018; Bullock 2016). These are announced as\nbeing means by which the Skeptic comes to suspension of judgment (I\n35). Recall that the Skeptic achieves his characteristic state of\nsuspension of judgment (epoch\u00ea), with respect to some\nproposition or other, by assembling arguments or considerations on both\nsides (PH I 12). The Skeptic needs techniques or tools to\nbring this suspension about. The modes divide into four groups, the Ten\nModes, the Five Modes, the Two Modes, and the Eight Modes. (Presumably\nthe Skeptic can employ methods other than the modes for bringing about\nsuspension of judgment. For extended analysis of one such method, that\nof \u2018reversal\u2019, see Castagnoli 2010: ch. 14.)\n3.5.1  The Ten Modes (PH I 35\u2013163)\n\n\nThis charming group of modes, attributed by Sextus in PH I\n36 to unnamed \u2018older skeptics\u2019, but in M VII 345\nto Aenesidemus (fl. first century BCE; see Schofield 2007; Hankinson\n2010), gets the longest treatment of all the groups of modes:\n\nThe mode depending on the variations\namong animals (I 40\u201378);\nThe mode depending on the differences\namong humans (I 79\u201390);\nThe mode depending on the differing\nconstitutions of the sense-organs (I 91\u201399);\nThe mode depending on circumstance (I\n100\u2013117);\nThe mode depending on positions and\nintervals and places (I 118\u201323);\nThe mode depending on admixtures (I\n124\u201328);\nThe mode depending on the quantities and\npreparations of existing things (I 129\u201334);\nThe mode deriving from relativity (I\n135\u201340);\nThe mode depending on frequent or rare\nencounters (I 141\u201344);\nThe mode depending on persuasions and customs and laws and\nbelief in myths and dogmatic suppositions (I 145\u201362).\n\n\n\nThe point of the Ten Modes is to provide us with propositions to use\nagainst dogmatists who make their usual rash claims about the way the\nworld is. They exploit the relativity at the heart of appearances to\nundermine these claims. There is a pattern underlying them, since they\neach supply us with two propositions: x (a thing) appears\nF in (situation) S, and x appears\nF* (i.e., something incompatible with F) in another\nsituation S* (Annas and Barnes 1985: 24). Here are some\nrepresentative examples: \n\n\nperfume appears very pleasant to humans but intolerable to\ndung-beetles and bees (first mode, PH I 55);\n the same honey appears sweet to me, but bitter to people with\njaundice (fourth mode, PH I 101);\nthe same tower appears from a distance round, but from close at\nhand square (fifth mode, PH I 118);\n the poets represent the gods as committing adultery and indulging in homosexual\nacts, while with us the law forbids these things (tenth mode, PH I 159).\n\n\n\nWhat does the Skeptic do with the pair of propositions\ngenerated by an application of the Ten Modes? Annas and Barnes suggest\nthe Skeptic propounds to himself instances of the following schema\n(1985: 25):\n\nThere are oppositions:\n\n (1)\n\nx appears F in S\n (2)\nx appears F* in S*\n\nbut the appearances are equipollent, i.e.,\n\n(3)\n we cannot\nprefer S to S* or vice versa;\n\nHence we arrive at suspension of judgment, i.e.,\n\n(4)\n we can\nneither affirm nor deny that x is really F or really\nF*.\n\n\n\n\n(For similar stories, see Hankinson 1995: 156; Striker 1993: 120.)\nThis is an unattractive interpretation as it stands. The Skeptic surely\ncannot endorse premiss (3); this is a dogma of the forbidden\nkind. Also, the Skeptic\u2019s suspension of judgment is not a\nconclusion to any argument (in the logical sense of the term),\nbut something that happens to us when we are confronted by equal and\nopposing arguments (see e.g., Barnes 1982: 59). So an alternative\ninterpretation would be to suppose that the Ten Modes are devices for\ngenerating precisely such equal and opposing arguments, and\nnot merely a pair of propositions (Morison 2011: 287\u201393). What would\nthe two opposing arguments be? Schematically, they would be as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nx appears F in S \nx appears F* in S*\n\n\nTherefore, x is F Therefore, x is\n  F*\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the application of the fourth mode that we saw above,\nit would generate these two arguments:\n\n(1) Honey is perceived to be\nsweet by healthy people\nTherefore, honey is sweet\n(2) Honey is perceived to be\nbitter by jaundiced people\nTherefore, honey is bitter\n\n\n\nArguments (1) and (2) are opposing arguments because their\nconclusions conflict, and they are equal because (2) matches\n(1) in argumentative strategy: \n\nThe second argument makes exactly\nthe same move as the first: where the first called upon a fact\nconcerning how honey is perceived, so did the second. (Morison\n2011: 292)\n\nSuspension of judgment will follow for the Skeptic, since\nhe is confronted by two equal and opposing arguments (and because the\narguments are equal, he doesn\u2019t need to say to himself any\npremiss such as premiss (3) of Annas and Barnes\u2019 argument given\nabove). Thus, the Ten Modes are devices for generating an equal and\nopposing argument in response to a dogmatist\u2019s attempt to show\nhow things are based on how they are perceived in some situation or\nother.\n3.5.2 The Five Modes (PH I 164\u201377)\n\n\nSextus\u2019 presentation of the Five Modes is brief and\nelliptical, which is much to be regretted, since philosophically they\nare the most interesting of all the modes. They are attributed here to\n\u2018the more recent Skeptics\u2019, but Diogenes La\u00ebrtius\ntells us that the modes were invented by Agrippa (DL IX 88), who\nprobably lived at the end of the first century BCE. Here is the\ncomplete text of Sextus\u2019 presentation (PH I 164\u20139):\n\n\n\n[164] The more recent Skeptics offer the following five modes of\nsuspension of judgment: first, the mode deriving from dispute; second,\nthe mode throwing one back ad infinitum; third, the mode\nderiving from relativity; fourth, the hypothetical mode; fifth, the\nreciprocal mode. [165] According to the mode deriving from dispute, we\nfind that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come\nabout both in ordinary life and among philosophers. Because of\nthis we are not able either to choose or to rule out anything, and we\nend up with suspension of judgment. [166] In the mode deriving from\ninfinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of\nconviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source,\nwhich itself needs another, and so ad infinitum, so that we\nhave no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension\nof judgment follows. [167] In the mode deriving from relativity as we\nsaid above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to\nthe subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we\nsuspend judgment on what it is like in its nature. [168] We have the\nmode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ad\ninfinitum, begin from something which they do not establish but\nclaim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession.\n[169] The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of\nthe object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the\nobject under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order\nto establish the other, we suspend judgment about both.\n\n\n\nThe reference in the discussion of the Mode of Relativity (\u0399 167)\nis a reference back to PH I 39 where Sextus tells us that all\nTen Modes of Aenesidemus can be put under the generic heading of\n\u2018relativity\u2019 (not to be confused with the eighth of the\nTen Modes, also known as the Mode of Relativity\u2014although it\nseems as though Sextus himself made precisely that confusion; Annas\nand Barnes 1985: 142\u20133; for more on this difficult mode, see\nBrennan and Lee 2014). So one of the Five Modes is an umbrella mode\nfor all of the Ten Modes, which, as we have seen, were best thought of\nas devices for generating equal and opposing arguments to arguments\nput forward by dogmatists which depend upon how things are perceived\nin this or that situation.\n\n\nThe Mode of Dispute is also a device for generating equal and\nopposing arguments, this time arguments which appeal to the authority\nof either ordinary life or some philosopher. For an example of this\nmode in operation, look at PH II 18: \n \nOf those who have\ndiscussed standards, some have asserted that there is one (e.g., the\nStoics and certain others), some that there is not (among them,\nXeniades of Corinth and Xenophanes of Colophon who says: \u2018but\nbelief is found over all\u2019); and we suspend judgment as to whether\nthere is one or not.\n \n Sextus imagines someone arguing for the\nphilosophical position that there is a \u2018standard\u2019 (more on\nthat below) on the basis of the fact that the Stoics say there is one;\nthe Skeptic would counter that one could equally well argue that there\nis no standard, since Xeniades and Xenophanes say there\nisn\u2019t one. The mode of dispute codifies a tactic in the\nSkeptic\u2019s ongoing fight with dogmatists: it is a weapon to be\ndeployed when the dogmatist employs an argument from authority. (For a\ndifferent view on what the mode of dispute is, see Barnes 1990a: ch.\n1.)\n\n\nIt is the three remaining modes which are the most interesting. To see\nhow they work, consider the following fact. When the dogmatist\nproduces an argument for a claim, P, either he produces (or\ngestures at) an argument which goes on forever\u2014an infinite\nregress\u2014or not. To produce an infinite regress would mean that\nin offering grounds for his claim P, he gives grounds,\nQ, and then for that he offers grounds, R, and so on,\nwithout ever repeating himself.  If he doesn\u2019t produce an\ninfinite regress, he produces an argument which stops somewhere. In\nother words, in offering grounds for his claim P, he gives\ngrounds, Q, and then for that he offers grounds, R,\netc. and this chain of grounds terminates somewhere. Now there are two\npossibilities, either this chain terminates in the same claim with\nwhich it started (P), or it doesn\u2019t. The first of those two\ncases is a case of a circular argument\u2014an argument for the\nconclusion P which eventually appeals to P as its own\nground. The second case is a case of an argument which starts from\nunsupported propositions (first principles, or axioms, perhaps), which\nfunction as the \u2018anchor\u2019 for the proposition P we\nare trying to prove.  Thus, there are exactly three possibilities for\nthe form an argument propounded by a dogmatist might take: an infinite\nregress, a reciprocal or circular argument, or one which terminates in\na hypothesis.\n\n\nThe usual interpretation of the modes of infinite regress,\nreciprocality, and hypothesis, is that they codify Sextus\u2019\ncondemnation of each of these three forms of argument. So, in\nby far the best and fullest treatment of the Five Modes to date, Barnes\n1990a, we are told that Sextus thinks that infinitely regressive\narguments are \u2018bad arguments\u2019 (1990a: 43). To be\nsure, \u2018Sextus usually leaves unspoken the thought that infinite\nregressions are Bad Things\u2019 (44), but, says Barnes (ibid), Sextus\ndoes offer us one reason for why they are bad: \u2018we have no point\nfrom which to begin to establish anything\u2019 (PH I 166).\nThe interesting philosophical question here is this: why should\nrecognition of a bad argument for the conclusion that P encourage us to\nsuspend judgment on whether P? If I argue that the world will\nend tomorrow on the grounds that Nostradamus says so, your recognition\nthat this is a terrible argument for its conclusion hardly makes you\nsuspend judgment on the question of whether the world will end\ntomorrow! Barnes\u2019 answer is this: \n\nIf the only consideration offered in support\nof a given claim leads to an unacceptable epistemological regression,\nthen we must suspend judgment on the claim. (1990a: 42; Barnes\u2019\nemphasis)\n \nBarnes points out that Sextus often lays out an argument and then says\nthat the skeptic will suspend judgment as far as that argument\ngoes (\u1f45\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u1ff3); the idea\nis that Sextus uses that formula to capture the fact that if\nsuch-and-such an argument is all you had to go on, you suspend\njudgment. (See Frede 1979: 10\u201311; 1984: 133; and Brunschwig 1990\nfor more on this phrase.)\n\n\nThus Barnes thinks that the mode of Infinite Regress generates\nsuspension of judgment in the face of an infinitely regressive argument\nby dint of the Skeptic\u2019s condemnation of that type of argument as\ndefective. Barnes extends this analysis to the cases of reciprocality\nand hypothesis too, claiming that Sextus rejects reciprocal arguments\nas \u2018bad arguments\u2019 (1990a: 65; his emphasis) and\nhypothetical arguments as \u2018valueless\u2019 (99). On this\ninterpretation, then, \n \nreciprocal arguments are bad arguments;\nand if the only reason we have for accepting or rejecting P is a bad\nargument, then we should neither accept nor reject P but suspend\njudgement; (65\u20136)\n\nIf the only thing that can be said for\nor against P is that some Dogmatist has hypothesized it, and if\nhypothesizing that P does not establish or warrant belief in P, then we\nshould suspend judgement over P. (99)\n\n\nBarnes\u2019 interpretation of what these three modes accomplish is\nunsatisfactory for a couple of reasons. First, it seems very unlikely that\nSextus would allow himself to condemn these three types of\nargumentation as bad or valueless: isn\u2019t this just the type of\ndogma that everyone agrees the Skeptic can\u2019t have?\nSecond, condemning this or that argument that a Dogmatist gives for a\nconclusion P, and suspending judgment accordingly on whether P, seems\nto fall foul of the strictures that Barnes himself places on what\nSextan suspension of judgment consists in: after all, Sextus supposedly\n\n assembles arguments in favour of an affirmative\nanswer, and arguments in favour of a negative answer. The two sets of\narguments exactly balance one another.\n \u1f18\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae [suspension of\njudgment] supervenes\u2014\u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae directed towards\nthe proposition that P. (Barnes 1982: 59)\n \n Condemning a dogmatist\u2019s\nargument for P does not involve taking into account any\nconsiderations for not-P. (Put it another way, Sextus seems to think\nthat Pyrrhonists suspend judgment in the face of an argument for P and\nan opposing argument for not-P\u2014not when they face an\nargument for P and considerations which undercut that\nargument\u2014for this distinction in epistemology, see\nentries on Defeasible Reasoning\nand Evidence.) Third, Sextus never\ncomes out and says that reciprocal and hypothetical arguments are\nactually bad arguments. In fact, strictly speaking, he doesn\u2019t\neven say that infinitely regressive arguments are bad; he merely says\nthat in such an argument, \u2018we have no point from which to begin\nto establish anything\u2019 (PH I 166), which could be taken\nas a straightforward description of what an infinitely\nregressive argument is, rather than philosophical condemnation\nof it.\n\n\nThere are several responses possible to these objections. One could\nclaim that Sextus is simply confused; his employment of the Five Modes\nis incompatible with his brand of Pyrrhonian Skepticism (no doubt\nbecause they derived from Agrippa and weren\u2019t original to\nSextus). Or, in response to the first objection, one could deny that\nSextus is condemning these types of argument in propria\npersona, and that he instead is taking the criticisms levelled by\ncertain dogmatists against these three types of arguments and using\nthem against those dogmatists who persist in propounding arguments in\nthose forms: Sextus\u2019 Five Modes are \n\na way of showing his\ndogmatic opponents that they ought to suspend judgment, given\ntheir epistemological standards. (Striker 2004: 16)\n\nAnother\noption would be to take the second objection seriously, and seek an\ninterpretation according to which these three modes function like the\nother two members of the Five (and like the Ten Modes) as devices for\ngenerating equal and opposing arguments (an approach suggested by\nMorison 2011: 293\u20134, and worked out in detail in Morison 2018). This latter approach seems promising in the light\nof those texts where Sextus explicitly envisages the Skeptic responding\nto the Dogmatists\u2019 use of hypotheses by coming up with opposing\nhypotheses which would in turn generate opposing conclusions\n(PH I 173; M VIII 370; M III 8; M\nVII 315; etc.; see Barnes 1990a: 100\u2013109).\n\n\nSextus himself thought that the Five Modes had universal\napplication: \u2018That every object of investigation can be referred\nto these modes we shall briefly show as follows\u2019 (PH I\n169). Unfortunately, what follows (PH I 170\u201377) is far from\nclear, and doesn\u2019t take the form one expects, namely the\nobservation that any argument whatsoever must have one of the three\nforms of hypothesis, reciprocality, or infinite regression. That\nstretch of text remains mysterious.\n3.5.3 The Two Modes (PH I 178\u20139)\n\n\nThe Two Modes probably also come from Agrippa (Barnes 1990b: 213),\nand represent an attempt \u2018to have a neat sceptical system\ncompounded out of three of the Five [Modes]: dispute, reciprocity and\nregression\u2019 (Barnes 1990b: 215). But Barnes finds the omission of\nthe Mode of Hypothesis philosophically troubling, given that it\n\u2018is a mode of the first importance to the Pyrrhonists\u2019\n(1990a: 119), and most discussions of the Five Modes mention the system\nof the Two Modes only in passing, especially since Sextus never employs\nthem explicitly during his discussions of dogmatic philosophical\npositions.\n3.5.4 The Eight Modes (PH I 180\u201386)\n\n\nFor these, see Hankinson 1995: 213\u201317.\n\nThey are modes in accordance\nwith which we bring the Dogmatists to a halt by raising puzzles about\ntheir particular causal explanations\u2014we do this because they\npride themselves on these especially. (PH I 180)\n\nThese\nmodes suggest lines of attack that the Skeptic could adopt in response\nto those arguments of the Dogmatists which attempt to discern causes.\nFor instance, \n\naccording to the second [mode], some people often\ngive an explanation in only one way, although there is a rich abundance\nenabling them to explain the object of investigation in a variety of\nways. (PH I 181)\n\n The idea here is that the Skeptic can\napply pressure to the Dogmatist\u2019s attempted explanation by\npointing out that there is an equally good alternative explanation.\nSextus himself suggests that the Eight Modes are superseded by the Five\nModes (PH I 185), and like the Two Modes, Sextus does not\nemploy them explicitly during the course of his writings.\n3.6 The Skeptical Phrases (PH I 187\u2013209)\n\n\nAs a Skeptic, what do you say when suspension of judgment comes upon\nyou in the face of all the arguments and counterarguments you frame in\nthe course of your investigations? Sextus offers the following\noptions:\n\n\u2018No more\u2019 (PH I 188\u201391), which is an\nexpression intended to capture the Skeptic\u2019s state of mind when\n\u2018I do not know which of these things I should assent to and which\nnot assent to\u2019 (191) (for extended discussion, see Castagnoli\n2010: 256\u201377);\n\u2018Perhaps\u2019, \u2018Maybe\u2019, and\n\u2018Possibly\u2019 (194\u20135), short for \u2018perhaps it is and\nperhaps it isn\u2019t\u2019 (194);\n\u2018I suspend judgment\u2019 (196), capturing the\nSkeptic\u2019s state of mind when \u2018I cannot say which of the\nthings proposed I should find convincing and which I should not find\nconvincing\u2019 (ibid);\n\u2018I determine nothing\u2019 (197), capturing the fact that\n\u2018I now feel in such a way as neither to posit dogmatically nor to\nreject any of the things falling under this investigation\u2019\n(ibid);\n\u2018Everything is undetermined\u2019 (198\u20139), short for\n\u2018Those of the matter investigated by the Dogmatists which I have\nconsidered appear such to me that none of them seems to me to exceed in\nconvincingness or lack of convincingness what conflicts with it\u2019\n(199);\n\u2018Everything is inapprehensible\u2019 (200), short for\n\u2018I suppose that up to now I have not apprehended any of these\nthings because of the equipollence of their opposites\u2019\n(ibid);\n\u2018I have no apprehension\u2019 and \u2018I do not\napprehend\u2019 (201);\n\u2018Opposed to every account there is an equal account\u2019\n(202\u20135), short for \u2018To every account I have scrutinized which\npurports to establish something in dogmatic fashion, there appears to\nme to be opposed another account, purporting to establish something in\ndogmatic fashion, equal to it in convincingness or lack of\nconvincingness\u2019 (203).\n\n\n\nSextus makes clear that in uttering these phrases, the Skeptic is\nengaging in a particular form of \u2018non-assertion\u2019\n(PH I 192\u20133; see Stough 1984). The phrases all represent how\nthings appear to the Skeptic, so, for instance, Sextus insists that\nwhen the Skeptic says \u2018I suspend judgment\u2019, he reports only\nhow the arguments appear to him: \u2018we say what appears to us about\nthem, when they make an impression on us\u2019 (196). This might\nappear to settle the question of the beliefs of the Skeptic, since it\ndoes seem as though the Skeptic, in saying what appears to him, states\nthe content of these appearances, and not just that things\nappear thus-and-so (see above, 3.4). However, Sextus also tells us\nthat the Skeptic \u2018takes \u2018is\u2019 in the sense of\n\u2018appears to me\u2019\u2019 (I 198; cf. I 135), so the question\nis not so easily settled after all. One thing is worth noting: if Frede\nis right about the beliefs of the Skeptic, then one of the beliefs of\nthe Skeptic is that \u2018Everything is inapprehensible\u2019 (I\n200). If this is the kind of belief that the Skeptic can have, then it\ncan\u2019t be a belief held as a matter of assembling reasons on\neither side, but must instead be a belief that he has on the basis of\nhis multiple experiences of coming to suspension of judgment,\nrather than on the basis of having a philosophical argument to that\neffect (Frede 1984: 138\u20139). This opens up the possibility that the\nSkeptic can in fact have the belief that Myles Burnyeat says is\nnecessary for the Skeptic to attain tranquillity\n (see above, 3.3).\n3.7 Difference between Pyrrhonism and other schools (PH I 210\u201341)\n\n\nSextus differentiates Pyrrhonian Skepticism from the philosophy of\nHeraclitus (210\u201312), Democritus (213\u201314), the Cyrenaics (215) (see\nespecially Fine 2000, 2003), and Protagoras (216\u201319), from Academic\nSkepticism (220\u201335) (see Striker 1981, 2010; Ioppolo 2009), and Medical\nEmpiricism (see Allen 2010). As stated above, this last section is\nparticularly puzzling, since Sextus, who was part of the Empiricist\nSchool of Medicine (hence his name), seems rather to align Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism with the Methodist School of Medicine, since the form of\nEmpiricism associated with the Empirical school \u2018makes\naffirmations about the inapprehensibility of unclear matters\u2019\n(PH I 236)\u2014presumably the sorts of theory-laden\naffirmations which the Skeptic would not allow himself\n (see 3.6 above)\u2014whereas the Methodists adhere more to the fourfold observances\nof everyday life that Sextus discussed in I 21\u20134\n (see 3.4 above). To\nmitigate the tension, Allen suggests that \u2018Sextus\u2019 remarks\ncan be read as criticizing a certain tendency in Empiricism rather than\nan unqualified repudiation of the school\u2019 (2010: 246), stressing\nthat Sextus\u2019 endorsement of Methodism is not as wholehearted as\nit might seem: \n\n \nthe medical persuasion of the Methodics has some\naffinity with Scepticism\u2014not absolutely but more so than the\nother medical schools and in comparison with them. (PH I 241)\n\n4. PH II and III; M VII\u2013XI\n\nPH I is like a manifesto: it tells you what Pyrrhonism is\nand why it is preferable to other philosophical persuasions. By\ncontrast, PH II and III show Sextus putting into practice the\nskeptical skill: they are stuffed full of dogmatic arguments\naccompanied by skeptical counterarguments (and sometimes just skeptical\ncounterarguments on their own\u2014see below).\n\n\nThe contents of PH II and III closely shadow those of\nM VII\u2013XI. For a table comparing M VII and VIII with\nPH II (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n2005: 193\u20135; for a similar table comparing M IX and X to\nPH III (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n2012: 161\u201364; for discussion of the comparisons between M XI\nto PH III (and relevant passages in M I\u2013VI), see Bett\n1997. To get an idea of the scope of PH II and III, and\nthereby the corresponding parts of M, here is the list of\ncontents of PH II and III (based on Annas and Barnes 2000: 66\nand 142):\n\nPH II 1\u201312: Can Skeptics investigate what the Dogmatists\ntalk about?\nPH II 13: Where should the investigation of Dogmatism\nbegin?\nPH II 14\u201317: Standards (or criteria)\nPH II 18\u201321: Is there a standard of truth?\nPH II 22\u201347: That by which\nPH II 48\u201369: That through which\nPH II 70\u201379: That in virtue of which\nPH II 80\u201384: Truths and Truth\nPH II 85\u201396: Is anything true by nature?\nPH II 97\u2013103: Signs\nPH II 104\u2013133: Are there any indicative signs?\nPH II 134\u2013143: Proof\nPH II 144\u2013192: Are there any proofs?\nPH II 193\u2013203: Deductions\nPH II 204: Induction\nPH II 205\u201312: Definitions\nPH II 213: Division\nPH II 214: The division of a word into significations\nPH II 215\u201318: Whole and part\nPH II 219\u201327: Genera and species\n\nPH II 228: Common attributes\nPH II 229\u201359: Sophisms\nPH III 1: The part concerned with physics; Active\nprinciples\nPH III 2\u201312: God\nPH III 13\u201316: Causes\nPH III 17\u201329: Is anything a cause of anything?\nPH III 30\u201337: Material Principles\nPH III 38\u201355: Are bodies apprehensible?\nPH III 56\u201362: Blending\nPH III 63: Motion\nPH III 64\u201381: Local motion\nPH III 82\u20134: Increase and decrease\nPH III 85\u201396: Subtraction and addition\nPH III 97: Transposition\nPH III 98\u2013101: Whole and part\nPH III 102\u2013108: Natural change\nPH III 109\u2013114: Generation and destruction\nPH III 115\u201318: Rest\nPH III 119\u201335: Place\nPH III 136\u201350: Time\nPH III 151\u201367: Number\nPH III 168: The ethical part of philosophy\nPH III 169\u201378: Good, bad and indifferent things\nPH III 179\u2013238: Is anything by nature good, bad or\nindifferent?\nPH III 239\u2013249: Is there an expertise in living?\nPH III 250\u201351: Is expertise in living found among\npeople?\nPH III 252: Can expertise in living be taught?\nPH III 253\u201358: Is anything taught?\nPH III 259\u201365: Are there any teachers and learners?\nPH III 265\u201373: Is there a way of learning?\nPH III 273\u20139: Does expertise in living benefit its\npossessor?\nPH III 280\u201381: Why do Skeptics sometimes deliberately\npropound arguments of feeble plausibility?\n\n\n\nNotice the division of the discussions into the traditional Stoic\ndivision of philosophy (Ierodiakonou 1993) into Logic (PH II),\nPhysics (PH III 1\u2013167), and Ethics (PH III\n168\u2013279).\n4.1 The criterion of truth\n\n\nThe most important part of PH II is the long discussion\nof the \u2018criterion\u2019 (or \u2018standard\u2019, as Annas and\nBarnes translate it) of truth (see especially Striker 1974: 1990b;\nBrunschwig 1988). Not only is it philosophically extremely rich,\nbut it plays a crucial role in the dialectic of the contemporary scholarly debate as to\nwhether the Pyrrhonian skeptic can have beliefs. The notion of a\ncriterion of truth was central to the epistemologies of both the Stoics\nand Epicureans:\n \nThe problem of the criterion of truth\u2026 is\nthe problem of how we discover or ascertain the truth\u2014the truth\nthat we need to find in order to attain knowledge. (Striker\n1990b: 151)\n \n The Epicureans and the Stoics had slightly different\ncandidates for what the criteria of truth would be.\n \nEpicurus\u2019 criteria were taken to be primitive truths, that\nis, ones that had to be accepted without proof or further\nargument; (Striker 1990b: 152)\n \nthese are the truths delivered by\nsense-impressions, preconceptions, and feelings (DL X 31), which would\nthen be used to work out the truth of non-primitive propositions. The\nStoics thought that the criteria of truth were special kinds of\nimpressions, so-called \u2018cognitive impressions\u2019, which were\nof such a nature so as to guarantee their own truth (roughly speaking,\nthey \u2018come about from what is\u2019 (DL VII 46) and are clear\nand distinct (see Frede 1983: 164)); they could also be used to work\nout the truth of other, unclear, matters. These two conceptions of the\ncriterion, the Epicurean and the Stoic, were christened the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 and \u2018prodelic\u2019 conceptions by\nBrunschwig (1988: 230\u2013233). (The terms \u2018adelic\u2019 and\n\u2018prodelic\u2019 derive from the Greek words\nad\u00ealon and prod\u00ealon, meaning\n\u2018unclear\u2019 and \u2018clear\u2019 respectively; thus, the\n\u2018adelic\u2019 conception of the criterion of truth is the one\nwhich emphasizes the role of the criterion in the discovery of\nunclear things, whereas the \u2018prodelic\u2019 conception\nis the one which emphasizes that those truths delivered by the\ncriterion are clearly true.) Brunschwig shows in detail that\nSextus conflates the two in his arguments against the criterion,\nalthough he acknowledges that this conflation does not dent the force\nof the objections that Sextus brings.\n\n\nSome of the flavour of Sextus\u2019 objections to the criterion can\nbe gleaned from the following passage (PH II 74\u20135):\n\n\n[74] Nor can we say that the soul apprehends external\nexisting objects through its sensory feelings inasmuch as the feelings\nof the senses are similar to the external existing objects. For how\nwill the intellect know whether the feelings of the senses are like the\nsense-objects, given that it does not itself come into contact with the\nexternal objects and that the senses make clear to it not the nature of\nthese objects but their own feelings, as we deduced from the modes of\nsuspension? [75] Just as someone who does not know Socrates but has\nlooked at a picture of him does not know whether the picture is like\nSocrates, so the intellect, studying the feelings of the senses but not\nobserving the external objects, will not know whether the feelings of\nthe senses are like the external existing objects. Therefore it cannot\nrely on similarity to judge them.\n\n\n\nRoughly speaking, Sextus is pointing out to the Epicureans and the\nStoics, both of whom attach great weight to the deliverance of the\nsenses, that there is no way that one\u2019s intellect can distinguish\namongst impressions those ones which are faithful to the way the world\nis: one only has access to one\u2019s impressions, and not the\nexternal world, so one cannot discern which of one\u2019s impressions\nare faithful to the external world, and assent to them alone. The\nintellect is impotent when it comes to deciding whether perceptual\nimpressions are to be an adequate criterion. (Sextus might be\nmisunderstanding the Stoic position here; see Frede 1983.)\n\n\nAt the end of Sextus\u2019 discussion in PH II, he clearly\nsignals, as one would expect, that he suspends judgment on whether\nthere are criteria of truth:\n\nYou must realize that it is not our\nintention to assert that standards of truth are unreal (that would be\ndogmatic); rather, since the Dogmatists seem plausibly to have\nestablished that there is a standard of truth, we have set up\nplausible-seeming arguments in opposition to them, affirming neither\nthat they are true nor that they are more plausible than those on the\ncontrary side, but concluding to suspension of judgement because of the\napparently equal plausibility of these arguments and those produced by\nthe Dogmatists. (PH II 79; cf. M VII 444)\n\n\nHow does Sextus\u2019 treatment of the criterion contribute to the\ndebate between scholars over the question of whether the Skeptic has\nany beliefs? The answer is that both Jonathan Barnes and Myles Burnyeat\nhave used Sextus\u2019 discussion of the criterion as a means of\nsecuring the conclusion that the Skeptic has no beliefs at all. Recall\nthat in PH I 13, Sextus says there are two meanings of the\nword dogma, according to the first of which the Skeptic\ndoes have dogmata, and according to the second of\nwhich, the Skeptic does not have dogmata. All\ncommentators are in agreement that the second kind of dogma is\nroughly to be understood as a \u2018philosophico-scientific\u2019\nopinion or tenet (Barnes 1982: 67), even if the parties to the debate\nhave a slightly different understanding of what a\n\u2018philosophico-scientific tenet\u2019 is (Morison 2011: 265\u20137).\nThe question is what kind of belief (if any kind at all) the first kind\nof dogma is. According to Barnes and Burnyeat, this first kind\nof dogma is something like the Skeptic\u2019s acknowledgment\nof his occurrent state of being appeared to in a certain way. Clearly,\naccording to Barnes and Burnyeat, this leaves a gap in Sextus\u2019\npresentation: \n what attitude does he take to ordinary beliefs?  The\nsentences of breakfast-time, bath-time, and bed-time\u2014\u2018The\nbutter\u2019s hard\u2019, \u2018The water\u2019s cold\u2019, \u2018The\nsprings are protruding\u2019\u2014do not express scientific\n \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, nor\nyet do they serve in avowals. If we are concerned to discover the\nscope of \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae in\nPH, it is precisely such humdrum sentences which will most\nexercise us; yet of them Sextus says nothing. (Barnes 1982:\n75\u20136)\n\n\nBoth Barnes and Burnyeat end up claiming that these ordinary\neveryday beliefs actually end up being discarded along with the\ndogmata in the second sense. They argue this by claiming that\nSextus does not have a criterion of truth: the Skeptic \n needs a criterion of truth, to determine which [of\nconflicting appearances] he should accept. But the sceptic then\nargues, often at some length, that there is no intellectually\nsatisfying criterion we can trust and use\u2014this is the real\nbackbone of the discussion. (Burnyeat 1980: 29)\n\nBarnes puts it as follows: \n\nwe cannot affirm\nthat the water is tepid unless we have a criterion of truth\u2014a\nway of judging that the \n\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 with which\nthe water affects us corresponds to the actual state of the\nwater; (1982: 77) \n\nBut the thesis that there is a\ncriterion of truth is itself a\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014indeed, it is a perfect specimen of those philosophico-scientific\ntenets which the Greeks called\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1; (78)\n\n\nOrdinary beliefs are not\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u2026 Nonetheless, in\nrejecting \u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 the Pyrrhonist\nmust reject ordinary beliefs; for the possession of ordinary beliefs\npresupposes the possession of at least one\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u2014the\n\u03b4\u03cc\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1 that there is a criterion of\ntruth. (ibid) (Cf. Burnyeat 1984: 115n. 36)\n\n\nBarnes\u2019 argument, however, is fallacious (for more detailed\ndiscussion, see Schwab 2013, whose main points are summarised here).\nThere are two fundamental flaws. First, the Hellenistic theory of the\ncriterion of truth was never supposed to be a theory about how\nbeliefs in general are formed, only beliefs which meet the\ncondition of being suitable for conferring knowledge. But second, and\nmore importantly, one needs to distinguish between suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth, and failing\nto have a criterion of truth. Since the deliverances of the\nnatural capacity of perception are criteria of truth according to the\nEpicureans, there is nothing one can do, short of putting one\u2019s\neyes out, to bring it about that one lacks this criterion of truth;\nmerely suspending judgment on whether there is such a thing as a\ncriterion of truth won\u2019t do the job. Similarly, since it is\ncognitive impressions, according to the Stoics, which are criteria of\ntruth, there is nothing one can do to bring it about that one lacks\nthese criteria of truth, short of damaging one\u2019s capacity for\nforming impressions (one\u2019s phantasia); merely suspending\njudgment on whether there is a criterion of truth won\u2019t do the\njob. Barnes actually acknowledges this flaw in his argument in a\nfootnote: \n\n\nThe Pyrrhonian may possess a criterion even\nif he himself does not believe that he does; and in that case\nhe is in a position to judge that p (1982: 78n. 76)\n\n\nIn short, Barnes\u2019 and Burnyeat\u2019s appeal to the\ndiscussion of the criterion of truth is unconvincing as an attempt to\nshow that for the Pyrrhonian Skeptic, ordinary beliefs are off limits.\nThe urbane interpretation is still standing.\n4.2 Negative dogmatism in M VII\u2013XI?\n\n\nAnother pressing philosophical issue raised by M VII\u2013IX\nis the alleged difference in the skepticism evident in M XI\n(\u2018Against the Ethicists\u2019) as compared to PH. \nThere can be no doubt that in M, Sextus is much more willing\nto give the counterargument to the Dogmatists\u2019 positions without\nlaying out the corresponding positive arguments that the Dogmatists\ngives. This lends an air of negative dogmatism to M. However,\nthis is merely stylistic: there is also no doubt that Sextus frequently\nemphasizes in M that we shouldn\u2019t take his arguments\ndogmatically, e.g., at M VII 444; VIII 159, 476 (Frede 1973:\n808), or that the upshot of his argumentation is that one should\nsuspend judgment e.g., M VII 443; VIII 298; IX 137: 191\u20132; X\n168 (Bett 1997: xxix). But there are some passages in \u2018Against\nthe Ethicists\u2019 which are harder, at least at first sight, to\nbring into line with the doctrine of suspension of judgment in\nPH. Sextus stresses in the ethical section of PH III\nthat one should suspend judgment as to whether anything is good or bad\nby nature (e.g., PH III 235), and so it is no surprise that\n\u2018M XI argues for the conclusion that nothing is\nby nature good or bad\u2019 (Bett 1997: xiv)\u2014so much one would\nexpect by way of counterarguments to the Dogmatists\u2019 positive\narguments. But Sextus gets perilously close to saying that the skeptic\nshould embrace the conclusions of these counterarguments (Bett\n1997: xiv): \n\nthe freedom \u2018from the trouble associated with the opinion\nthat something bad or good is present\u2019 will \u2018come to him\nfrom his thinking nothing good or bad by nature\u2019\n(M XI 118; my emphasis);\n\u2018when reason has established that none of these\nthings is by nature good or by nature bad, there will be a release\nfrom disturbance and a peaceful life will await us\u2019 (M\nXI 130; my emphasis);\n\u2018It will only be possible to avoid this [sc. trouble], then,\nif we show to the person who is disturbed on account of his\navoidance of the bad or his pursuit of the good, that there is not\nanything either good or bad by nature\u2019 (M XI 140; my\nemphasis). \n\n\n The way to avoid saddling Sextus with an inconsistency is to\nsee that Sextus is not suggesting that the Skeptic must\nbelieve that nothing is good or bad by nature, but rather that\nthe Skeptic must have equally convincing arguments up his sleeve\nthat conclude that nothing is by nature good or bad\u2014once\nwe have managed that, \u2018there will be a release from disturbance\nand a peaceful life will await us\u2019. (For pushback against this, see Bett 2018: 13n. 24.)\n5. M I\u2013VI\n\n\nThe six books of M I\u2013VI, taken together, constitute an\nattack on the liberal arts. For their general aim, see Barnes 1988. The\nmost important feature of M I\u2013VI, which can be misleading, is\nthat in them, there is often the appearance of negative dogmatism, i.e.,\nof claims that this or that art doesn\u2019t exist. Take for example\nM I 90: \u2018So let this stand to show the non-existence of\ngrammar, at least on the grammarians\u2019 conception of it\u2019. Bett 2018: 11\u201315 urges us to view such moments as traces of a previous stage of Pyrrhonism. Alternatively,\nrather than interpret this as occasional departures from Sextus\u2019\nover-arching plan to induce suspension of judgment (which is in any\ncase still present in texts such as M I 6), one could take\nthese apparent statements of negative dogmatism to be \u2018the\nequipollent counterpoise to the technicians\u2019 arguments\u2019\n(Blank 1998: l, summarising Barnes 1988: 72\u20137). (See above 4.2 for a\nsimilar story about M XI.)\n\nI.\n M I 1\u201340 is a highly general introduction to all six\nworks, and then Against the Grammarians starts properly at I\n41. For this work, see Blank 1998. Against the Grammarians is\nmuch the longest of the six books, standing at 320 sections. There is\ndiscussion of the question \u2018What is Grammar?\u2019 (57\u201389), an\nattack on the \u2018expert\u2019 part of grammar, i.e., the part\nconcerned with letters, parts of speech, etc. (99\u2013247), and an attack\non the part of grammar which concerns poets and prose-writers\n(270\u2013320), i.e., the part which deals with the interpretation of poetry,\nand which Sextus argues is useless because it makes no contribution to\nhuman flourishing.\nII.\n Against the Rhetoricians is shorter, at only 113\nsections. It considers various definitions of what rhetoric is, what\nbenefit rhetoric is to individuals or to cities, what the goal of\nrhetoric is, and what the parts of rhetoric are, all with a view to\nattacking its status as an art.\nIII.\n Against the Geometers stands at 116 sections. It takes\ngeometers to task for their employment of hypotheses in establishing\ntheorems, and then attacks the hypotheses themselves, such as the\ndefinitions of body, point, line (particularly the definition of the\nline as \u2018length without breadth\u2019), and angle. For this\nwork, see Dye and Vitrac 2009.\nIV.\n Against the Arithmeticians has a mere 34 sections. This\nwork outlines the extraordinary views of the Pythagoreans concerning\nthe power of numbers, and then seeks to undermine them by arguing that\nPlatonic notion of a monad or unit (\u2018the One\u2019) is\n\u2018inconceivable\u2019 (17), adding as an aside that the notion of\na dyad doesn\u2019t fare much better (21\u201322), and by attacking the\nprinciples of addition and subtraction (23\u201333). \u2018But if number is\nconceived as subsisting through addition, as I said, and subtraction,\nand we have shown that neither of these exists, one must declare that\nnumber is nothing\u2019 (34). The work thus has a clear structure:\npresentation of arguments in favour of the existence of numbers (from\nthe Pythagoreans), followed by presentation of arguments against the\nexistence of numbers.\nV.\n Against the Astrologers, in 106 sections. Sextus attacks\nnot astronomy (1), which is one thing the term \u2018astrology\u2019\nreferred to in classical times, but \u2018the casting of\nnativities\u2019 (Bury\u2019s translation of the term\n\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b8\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\nin section 2) and horoscopes. The first half of the work involves\nSextus laying out the basics of the Chaldean theory of prognostication,\nand the second half contains his counterarguments, including\nfascinating observations about the difficulty of establishing when\nsomeone is conceived, the difficulty of establishing when they are born\n(\u2018is it when the child begins to emerge into the cold air, or\nwhen it has emerged a little, or when it is deposited on the\nground?\u2019, M V 65), and the difficulty of using accurate\ntime-keeping devices to detect which astronomical phenomena are\noccurring at what time.\nVI.\n Against the Musicians is in 68 sections. For this work,\nsee Greaves 1986; Bett 2013. Sextus attacks the standing of music as a science, by\nquestioning whether it is useful for happiness (7\u201337) and by\nquestioning whether it is a science at all (38\u201368), just as he did in\nthe case of grammar (a comparison Sextus himself makes at section 4).\nIn the first part, Sextus assembles arguments in favour of music being\nuseful for happiness (7\u201318) and arguments against (19\u201337); the second\npart consists wholly of the arguments against the existence of music as\na suitable subject for theoretical discourse, with Sextus leaving\nunstated the arguments in favour.\n\n6. References for the later history of Sextus\u2019 writings\n\n\nFor the fascinating story of the rediscovery of Sextus\u2019\nwritings in the Renaissance, see Floridi 2002 and 2010.\n",
