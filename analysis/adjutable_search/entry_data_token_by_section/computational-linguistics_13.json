    "main_text": "Semantic interpretation || Coping with semantic ambiguity and underspecification\n4.3 Coping with semantic ambiguity and underspecification\n\nWe noted earlier that language is potentially ambiguous at all\nlevels of syntactic structure, and the same is true of semantic\ncontent, even for syntactically unambiguous words, phrases and\nsentences. For example, words like bank,\nrecover, and cool have\nmultiple meanings even as members of the same lexical category; nominal\ncompounds such as ice bucket, ice\nsculpture, olive oil, or baby\noil  leave unspecified the underlying relation between the\nnominals (such as constituency or purpose). At the sentential level,\neven for a determinate parse there may be quantifier scope ambiguities\n(\u201cEvery man admires a certain woman\u201d\u2014Rosa Parks vs. his mother); and habitual and generic\nsentences often involve temporal/atemporal ambiguities\n(\u201cRacehorses are (often) skittish\u201d), among others.\nMany techniques have been proposed for dealing with the various\nsorts of semantic ambiguities, ranging from psychologically\nmotivated principles, to knowledge-based methods,\nheuristics, and statistical approaches. Psychologically\nmotivated principles are exemplified by Quillian's spreading\nactivation model (described earlier) and the use of selectional\npreferences in word sense disambiguation. For example,\nin \n\u201cThe job took five hours,\u201d took might be\ndisambiguated to the sense of taking up time because that sense of the\nverb prefers a temporal complement, and job might be\ndisambiguated to task (rather than, say, occupation)\nbecause of the direct associative link between the concept of a task\nand its time demands. Examples of knowledge-based disambiguation would\nbe the disambiguation of ice sculpture to a constitutive\nrelation based on the knowledge that sculptures may be carved or\nconstructed from solid materials, or the disambiguation of a man\nwith a hat to a wearing-relation based on the knowledge\nthat a hat is normally worn on the head. (The possible meanings may\nfirst be narrowed down using heuristics concerning the limited types\nof relations typically indicated by nominal compounding or by\nwith-modification.)  Heuristic principles used in scope\ndisambiguation include island constraints (quantifiers such\nas every and most cannot expand their scope beyond\ntheir local clause) and differing wide-scoping tendencies for\ndifferent quantifiers (e.g., each is apt to assume wider\nscope than some).  Statistical approaches typically extract\nvarious features in the vicinity of an ambiguous word or phrase that\nare thought to influence the choice to be made, and then make that\nchoice with a classifier that has been trained on an annotated text\ncorpus. The features used might be particular nearby words or their\nparts of speech or semantic categories, syntactic dependency\nrelations, morphological features, etc..  Such techniques have\nthe advantage of learnability and robustness, but ultimately will\nrequire supplementation with knowledge-based techniques. For example,\nthe correct scoping of quantifiers in contrasting sentence pairs such\nas\n\n\n(4.1) Every child at the picnic was roasting\na wiener.\n(4.2)\nEvery child at the picnic was watching a hot\nair balloon overhead,\n\n\nseems to depend on world knowledge in\na way unlikely to be captured as a word-level statistical regularity.\nHabitual and generic sentences present particularly challenging\ndisambiguation problems, as they may involve temporal/atemporal\nambiguities (as noted), and in addition may require augmentation with\nquantifying adverbs and constraints on quantificational domains\nmissing from the surface form.  For example,\n\n\n(4.3)\nRacehorses are (often) skittish when they are\npurebred\nwithout the quantifying adverb often is unambiguously\natemporal, ascribing enduring skittishness to purebred racehorses\nin general. (Thus in general appears to be the\nimplicit default adverbial.) But when the quantifying adverb is\npresent, the sentence admits both an atemporal reading according to\nwhich many purebred racehorses are characteristically skittish, as\nwell as a temporal reading to the effect that purebred racehorses\nin general are subject to frequent episodes of\nskittishness. If we replace purebred by at the starting\ngate,  then only the episodic reading of skittish\nremains available, while often may quantify over racehorses,\nimplying that many are habitually skittish at the starting gate, or it\nmay quantify over starting-gate situations, implying that racehorses\nin general are often skittish in such situations; furthermore, making\nformal sense of the phrase at the starting gate evidently\ndepends on knowledge about horse racing scenarios. \nThe interpretive challenges presented by such sentences are (or should\nbe) of great concern in computational linguistics, since much of\npeople's general knowledge about the world is most naturally expressed\nin the form of generic and habitual sentences. Systematic\nways of interpreting and disambiguating such sentences would\nimmediately provide a way of funneling large amounts of knowledge into\nformal knowledge bases from sources such as lexicons, encyclopedias,\nand crowd-sourced collections of generic claims such as those in Open\nMind Common Sense (e.g., Singh\net al. 2002; Lieberman et al. 2004; Havasi et\nal. 2007). Many theorists assume that the logical forms of such\nsentences should be tripartite structures with a quantifier that\nquantifies over objects or situations, a restrictor that limits the\nquantificational domain, and a nuclear scope (main clause) that makes\nan assertion about the elements of the domain (e.g., see Carlson\n2011; Cohen 2002; or Carlson & Pelletier\n1995).  The challenge lies in specifying a mapping from surface\nstructure to such a logical form. While many of the principles\nunderlying the ambiguities illustrated above are reasonably well\nunderstood, general interpretive algorithms are still lacking. It\nappears that such algorithms will involve stepwise elaboration of an\ninitially incomplete, ambiguous logical form, rather than a\nstraightforward syntax-semantics transduction, since the features on\nwhich the correct formalization depends transcend syntax: They include\nones such as Carlson's individual-level/stage-level distinction among\nverb phrases and his object-level/kind-level distinction among verb\narguments (Carlson 1977, 1982), as well as pragmatic features such as\nthe given/new distinction (influenced by phrasal accent), lexical\npresuppositions, linguistic context, and background knowledge.\n",
