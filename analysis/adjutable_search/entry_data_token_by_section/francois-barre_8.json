    "main_text": "The Equality of the Sexes || Inequality is a false belief\n4.1 Inequality is a false belief\n\nThis argument is based on Descartes\u2019 method for the search of\ntruth\n (section 2.1)\n and closely connected to Poulain\u2019s criticism of prejudice\n (section 3.1).\n It is Poulain\u2019s most substantial argument in the sense that a\nlarge part of De l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 consists of\nhis refutations of claims about the inferiority of women. Poulain\nargues that beliefs about women are not based on women\u2019s essence\nor nature, but historically constructed prejudices\n (section 3.2).\n Desmond Clarke, in particular, has emphasized this aspect of\nPoulain\u2019s criticism and connected it to a general Cartesian\ncriticism of Scholastic explanatory models, which explain \u201cany\nphenomenon simply by postulating a \u2018form\u2019 or\n\u2018nature\u2019 that corresponds to each reality that needs to be\nexplained\u201d (Clarke 2013: 41). Poulain\u2019s criticism of a\nscholastic notion of \u2018nature\u2019 is most explicit in a\npassage where he argues against \u201cLawyers\u2019 opinions\u201d,\nwhich carry \u201ca lot of weight for many people because they\nprofess specifically to give everyone their due\u201d (T1en 152; TTfr\n94). These Scholastic lawyers, among whom scholars claim that Poulain\nincludes Hugo Grotius (Stuurman 2004: 166\u2013167), say \u201cthat\nit is nature that assigns women to the lowest functions in society and\nremoves them from public offices\u201d, but they would, according to\nPoulain, \n\n\nbe hard pressed if they were required to explain intelligibly what\nthey mean by \u2018nature\u2019 in this context, and to explain how\nnature distinguished the two sexes, as they claim. (T1en 152; TTfr\n94\u201395) \n\n\nPoulain argues that \u2018nature\u2019 is, in this context, a\nnon-explanatory concept. We can compare his criticism with that of\nGournay: whereas she argues that when correctly interpreted, the\nScholastic concept of the human being does not allow for a distinction\nof sex, he argues that this kind of concept cannot explain the true\nnature of the sexes in the first place.\n\nPoulain also argues that inequality is a false belief by giving\nnumerous examples of the equal and even superior abilities of women.\nMany of these examples are speculative generalizations, which would\nnot satisfy Cartesian criteria for certainty. Poulain writes, for\nexample, that it \n\n\nis a pleasure to hear a woman pleading a legal case. No matter how\ncomplicated a case may be, she unravels it and explains it clearly.\n[\u2026] One finds throughout women\u2019s conduct of legal cases a\ncertain competence that men lack. (T1en 139; TTfr 79) \n\n\nThe generalization made here is not valid and does in fact resemble\nthe generalizations about women\u2019s inferiority that Poulain is\nattacking. But we must also note that he does not need more than one\nexample of a woman who pleads her case well in order to show that\nwomen are not by their nature unable to do so. In this sense\nhis generalizations are superfluous. Poulain seems to be aware of this\nphilosophically more valid aspect of arguing from examples when he\nwrites:\n\n\nJust as it is rather unfair to believe that all women are indiscreet\nsimply because one knows five or six who are such, one should be\nequally fair and conclude that women are capable of scientific study\nbecause one sees that a number of them have been able to raise\nthemselves to such heights. (T1en 142; TTfr 82)\n\n\nEven here Poulain is not completely clear about the crucial difference\nbetween invalid generalizations from examples and the valid use of\nexamples in order to show that a given generalization is untrue. But\nhe allows for a generous interpretation according to which his primary\naim is to show that generalizations about the inferiority of women are\nfalse.\n",
