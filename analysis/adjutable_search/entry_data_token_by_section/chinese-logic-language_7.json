An\nabundance of evidence suggests that they were aware of both the\npervasiveness of intensional phenomena in natural language and the way\nin which these phenomena tend to frustrate the view that natural\nlanguage meaning is essentially compositional in structure (Willman\n2010). They were probably also aware not only of the distinction\nbetween intensions and extensions, but also of the way in which this\ndistinction may be essential to the determination of the truth or\nadmissibility of sentences involving intensional contexts. Moreover,\nthey do not seem to have made any attempt to explain away these\ncontexts in terms of basic semantic principles, by denying that they\nexist, or by asserting that they can be reduced to, or explained in\nterms of, other more philosophically admissible modes of expression.\nOn the contrary, they not only embraced intensionality as a\nfundamental feature of language, but also attempted to exploit it for\nthe purpose of advancing their philosophical views, particularly their\nviews on ethics.\n\nTo be sure, the Mohists did not attempt to develop any rigorous\nnotation for handling differences of logical form. But as noted in\nexamples above, they were wary of assuming that sentences or\nexpressions with the same grammatical form have analogous semantical\nrepresentations. It is quite possibly from observations like these\nthat the later Mohists were led to compare the satisfaction conditions\nof expressions obtained from the intersubstitution of co-referential\nterms and co-extensive predicates. They did so by utilizing what we\nwould now identify as tests for intensionality. Many of these tests\ninvolved typical epistemic verbs, like \u201cknow\u201d,\n\u201cthink of\u201d, and \u201clove\u201d. For instance, in B40\nof the Canons the Mohists claim that:\n\nTo assert the identity of knowing dogs and knowing canines is a\nmistake; to not do so is not a mistake.\n\nThis translation is but one of many that have variously interpreted\nthe original text, and some scholars have claimed that the original is\nin need of textual emendation due to copyist errors in centuries past\n(e.g., He 1971 and Chen 1983; see also Zong 2000). However, it does\nmake sense when we recognize that the Mohists spent a great deal of\neffort thinking about how the meanings of simple names vary in\ncombination with others. According to A.C. Graham, the names\ngou (dog) and quan (canine) were the Mohists\u2019\nstock examples of terms that refer to the same thing, but which have\nslightly different senses, probably due to their individual\netymologies. Contemporary philosophers of language might consider that\nthe Mohists were on the verge of developing an ontology of mental\nstates with these examples, thinking of the opacity of the context\n\u201cknowing\u201d as a consequence of potential failures of\nknowledge. Jack might know what a dog is, but he might not know what a\ncanine is, regardless of the co-extension of \u201cdog\u201d and\n\u201ccanine\u201d. But the Mohists were not likely thinking of\nlanguage in any way as a window to the mind. There is no indication\nanywhere in Mohist literature suggesting that they were interested in\ndeveloping a classification of mental states. Indeed, the Mohists\nweighed the consequences of comparing linguistic expressions involving\nnot only those intensional verbs we usually associate with mental\nstates, such as \u201cknow\u201d, \u201cthink of\u201d,\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201clove\u201d and the like, but also\napparently intensional contexts introduced by verbs having nothing\nobviously to do with the mind, and they provide no indications that\nthey thought about distinguishing them.\n\nIn the Xiao Qu, for example, the Mohists give an intensional\nanalysis of linguistic contexts involving the expressions\n\u201criding\u201d (cheng), \u201centering\u201d\n(ru), \u201cabounding in\u201d (duo), \u201cbeing\nwithout\u201d (wu), \u201cserve\u201d (shi), and\neven \u201ckilling\u201d (sha). Their interest seems to\nhave been primarily semantical, with the issue of compositionality at\nthe forefront of their inquiries. They were concerned with whether or\nnot ideographs in combination produced meaningful wholes that are\nproperly analyzed as the sums of their constituent parts. Those not\nanalyzable in this way were likely deemed idiomatic. Consider again\nthe curious use of the phrase \u201centering wood\u201d (ru\nmu) in the following line from NO15:\n\nA boat is wood, but entering a boat is not entering wood.\n\nThe verb \u201centering\u201d (ru) would not normally be\nconsidered to indicate an intensional context. Zhang and Liu (2007)\nanalyze the complex expression ru mu (entering wood) as\n\u201cgoing to die\u201d, a meaning obviously surpassing the\nconnotation of ru chuan (entering a boat), in this case\nsignifying only the simple action of going into a boat. On the other\nhand, each of these expressions is identical in grammatical form, a\nfact again leading the Mohists to the conclusion that grammatical form\ncan be deceptive and that any expression may be either an analyzable\ncompound or an undifferentiable semantic whole.\n\nIt might be noted that the terms \u201cboat\u201d and\n\u201cwood\u201d are not co-extensive, and hence cannot be\ninterchanged to test whether or not the context in which they occur is\nintensional. Yet while it is true that the Mohists recognized names of\ndifferent scope (lei categorizes names that classify many\nthings while si categorizes those that refer to just one),\nthey were clearly not confined to conceiving expressions of the form\n\u201cX is Y\u201d as assertions of predication.\nAs noted above, their concept of \u201csameness\u201d\n(tong) was inclusive enough to accommodate a reading that in\nno way presupposes a failure of extension. For instance, a boat is\nwood in the sense that it is made up of wood, where \u201cwood\u201d\nis conceived not as a general kind, but as the very stuff of which the\nboat in question is made. This is likely what the Mohists had in mind\nwith this example because the point they are making clearly turns on a\ncomparison of the meanings of linguistic complexes\n(\u201centering a boat\u201d and \u201centering wood\u201d) and\nhow the meanings of words change in virtue of the contexts in which\nthey occur.\n\nMoreover, intensionality is marked by tests other than the\nintersubstitution of co-referential terms, co-extensive predicates, or\nlogically equivalent sentences. A context may be deemed intensional if\nit contains a phrase with a quantifier that allows for an\n\u201cunspecific\u201d reading (see the entry on\n intensional transitive verbs).\n For example, it may be true that Oedipus is seeking a member of his\nfamily, but not true that he is seeking Jocasta, in spite of the fact\nthat Jocasta is a member of his family. For, there might be no family\nmember in particular whom Oedipus is seeking. Something like\nthis seems to be the point the Mohists are making with the following\nexample:\n\nHer younger brother is a handsome man, but loving her younger brother\nis not loving a handsome man.\n\nThe sparsity of grammatical marks for quantification in Classical\nChinese does not require us to read the expression mei ren\n(\u201ca handsome man\u201d) in terms of the existentially\nquantified phrase \u201csome x such that x is male\nand handsome\u201d. But this only makes the Mohists\u2019 point more\nglaring. If \u201cloving a handsome man\u201d (ai mei ren)\nmay be taken to involve romantic attraction, and not just the kind of\nfilial love that exists between family members, then we can see why\nthe Mohists would consider this a failure of inference.\n\nSimilar points are made with regard to the remaining non-epistemic\nintensional transitive verbs. For example:\n\nThe father of huo is a human; and yet it does not follow from\nthis that when huo serves his father, he is serving a\nhuman.\n\nEvidence that the transitive verb shi (serve) is intensional\ncomes from the expression \u201cserving a human\u201d, which was\nunderstood in terms of the behavior of a service worker, somebody who\nacts as a servant. Quite obviously this has nothing to do with states\nof mind (such as those involving failures of knowledge).\n\nOn the other hand, we feel rightly confused when the Mohists say:\n\nRobbers are people \u2026 but killing robbers is not killing\npeople.\n\nThe term \u201ckilling\u201d is ordinarily thought of as an\nextensional verb. It is a matter of some controversy, but the Mohists\napparently felt that the combination of the ideographs sha\n(killing) and dao ren (robbers) formed an idiom that was\nrecognized as a distinct, unanalyzable unit of common speech, carrying\nwith it connotations of justified execution. This was not discerned in\nthe semantics of \u201ckilling people\u201d, which probably more\nsimply indicated an act of murder. Indeed, the Mohists explicitly\nprohibited the latter in connection with their espoused doctrine of\nuniversal love (cf. NO17 from Graham\u2019s translation\n(2003 [1978])). Not unlike many Western philosophers, the Mohists seem\nto have felt that careful attention to semantical nuances can have an\nimportant bearing on moral issues.\n\nThat is to say, part of the Mohists\u2019 interest in the analysis of\nlanguage stems from a firm conviction that the semantical distinctions\nuncovered by careful analysis can help put to rest certain questions\nabout the legitimacy of their basic moral beliefs. The Mohists\ninsisted that proper conduct involves \u201cloving all people without\nexception\u201d (which implies opposing acts of murder), but they\nwere also not opposed to the \u201cjustified execution\u201d of\nthose found guilty of serious crime. When questioned on grounds of\ninconsistency, they replied by pointing out that the endorsement of\njustified execution is not an inhumane act that compromises their\nstance on the value of loving all people. This might not have\nconvinced many of their interlocutors that their doctrine of universal\nlove is justified, but it would have put to rest the charge that they\nwere being illogical, and in any case consistency would surely have\nbeen conceived as a mark of superiority over any of the views of their\nopponents incapable of withstanding comparable scrutiny.\n",
