    "main_text": "\n\nIn the May 15, 1935 issue of Physical Review Albert Einstein\nco-authored a paper with his two postdoctoral research associates at\nthe Institute for Advanced Study, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. The\narticle was entitled \u201cCan Quantum Mechanical Description of\nPhysical Reality Be Considered Complete?\u201d (Einstein et\nal. 1935). Generally referred to as \u201cEPR\u201d, this paper\nquickly became a centerpiece in debates over the interpretation of\nquantum theory, debates that continue today. Ranked by impact, EPR is\namong the top ten of all papers ever published in Physical\nReview journals. Due to its role in the development of quantum\ninformation theory, it is also near the top in their list of currently\n\u201chot\u201c papers. The paper features a striking case where two\nquantum systems interact in such a way as to link both their spatial\ncoordinates in a certain direction and also their linear momenta (in\nthe same direction), even when the systems are widely separated in\nspace. As a result of this \u201centanglement\u201d, determining\neither position or momentum for one system would fix (respectively)\nthe position or the momentum of the other. EPR prove a general lemma\nconnecting such strict correlations between spatially separated\nsystems to the possession of definite values. On that basis they argue\nthat one cannot maintain both an intuitive condition of local action\nand the completeness of the quantum description by means of the wave\nfunction. This entry describes the lemma and argument of that 1935\npaper, considers several different versions and reactions, and\nexplores the ongoing significance of the issues raised.\n",
