    "main_text": "The Allocation of Organs || The complexity of organ allocation\n3.1 The complexity of organ allocation\n\nThe allocation of organs is certainly not just a medical problem to be\nsolved with medical expertise (Veatch and Ross 2015). The principles\nthat apply to allocation are quintessentially ethical principles.\nHowever, applying those principles correctly to produce final answers\nas to who receives organs does require medical knowledge and much\nother knowledge besides. To see the point, imagine that we have to\ndesign an organ allocation scheme.\n\nSuppose we start with first-best principles, such as allocation\naccording to need, or urgency, or benefit, or equity, or some mix of\nthese principles based on some judgment of their relative weight.\nClearly, applying these principles requires considering what organs\ndo. Organs differ in many ways that matter to allocation, such as\n\n\nalternative treatments to transplantation, the ability to stratify\nrisk, the different factors that affect patient and/or graft survival,\nand differences in the interactions between donor graft and recipients\non outcomes. (NHSBT 2013, p. 8)\n\n\nTo explain just one of these factors, nearly all patients in rich\ncountries whose kidneys have failed have the alternative of dialysis,\nwhereas most of those with acute liver failure have no alternative to\ntransplantation but death. Liver allocation, to a much greater extent\nthan kidney allocation, must thus make some judgment about the\nimportance of saving lives immediately compared with, for instance,\nimproving quality or extending lifespan.\n\nNext, the application of the principles ought to range across all the\nstages of transplantation. Details vary from place to place and organ\nto organ but in general the pathway to transplantation can be thought\nof as having these steps: being referred for assessment; being\nassessed and then listed; and receiving an organ once listed. People\nmay be halted at each step, perhaps for medical reasons, perhaps\nbecause they cannot pay (the so-called \u201cgreen screen\u201d) or\nbecause the public system will not pay. Principles need to range over\nall steps. For instance, scrupulous fairness to those on a waiting\nlist may obscure injustice in access to the list.\n\nImplementing first-best principles can have important secondary\nconsequences. To take one example, the scheme the U.S. introduced in\n1989 to allocate kidneys increased the weighting for immune system\ncompatibility and the effect was to reduce the proportion of\nAfrican-Americans transplanted (Elster 1992: ch. 5). Many thought the\nresult inequitable because of the disparate impact even though the\ndifference was not due to overt discrimination (see the entry on\n justice, inequality, and health).\n\nIn addition, a scheme must take account of procedural values such as\ntransparency, non-arbitrariness, and public deliberation (Miller 1999,\nch.5). For instance, we may think that time spent waiting on a list is\nonly a rough proxy for fairness. Perhaps someone entered a list late\nbecause of the difficulties in finding the time and resources to\ncomplete the requirements for listing; in perfect fairness that person\nshould not be disadvantaged as a result. And yet time waiting is a\nvisible and checkable criterion, whereas taking account of diverse\nsocial and economic circumstances would be procedurally fraught when\nit comes to ordering a priority list.\n\nFinally, allocation must take account of incentives in two distinct\nways. It must consider how the scheme would be operated. The ideal\napplication of first-best principles would require considerable\nflexibility and discretion. Fixed rules or algorithms inevitably fail\nto capture all the relevant information. And yet flexibility and\ndiscretion are open to gaming by doctors and patients, for instance in\nexaggerating the urgency of transplanting a patient. Thus incentive\neffects may make an ideal method sub-ideal in practice.\n\nAllocation must also consider the incentive effects of an allocation\nscheme on the size of the donor pool.\n\nThis topic is discussed below.\n",
