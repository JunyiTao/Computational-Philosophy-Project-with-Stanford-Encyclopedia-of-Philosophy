    "main_text": "Implications of Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Illusionism vs/ Disillusionism\n3.1 Illusionism vs/ Disillusionism\n\nIllusionism is the view that while we lack free will and\nmoral responsibility, we should nonetheless promote belief in\nthese notions since to disbelieve in moral responsibility would have\ndire consequences for society and ourselves (see Smilansky 1999, 2000,\n2002, 2013). According to Saul Smilansky, one of the lead proponents\nof illusionism, most people not only believe in actual possibilities\nand the ability to transcend circumstances, but have \n\n\ndistinct and strong beliefs that libertarian free will is a condition\nfor moral responsibility, which is in turn a condition for just reward\nand punishment (2000: 26\u201327; for more on the folk psychology of\nfree will and moral responsibility, cf. Nichols & Knobe 2007;\nNichols 2004; Deery et al. 2013; Sarkissian et al. 2010; Nahmias et\nal. 2005; Nahmias et al. 2007; Murray & Nahmias 2014). \n\n\nSmilansky and other proponents of illusionism go on to argue that\nwhile our commonplace beliefs in free will and desert-entailing moral\nresponsibility are illusions, if people were to accept this truth\nthere would be wide-reaching negative intrapersonal and interpersonal\nconsequences. It would be devastating, they warn, if we were to\ndestroy such beliefs since the difficulties caused by \u201cthe\nabsence of ultimate-level grounding\u201d are likely to be great,\ngenerating \u201cacute psychological discomfort\u201d for many\npeople and \u201cthreatening morality\u201d (Smilansky 2000: 166).\nTo avoid such deleterious social and personal consequences, and to\nprevent the unraveling of our moral fabric, illusionism contends that\npeople should be allowed their positive illusion of free will and\nmoral responsibility\u2014i.e., we should not take these beliefs away\nfrom people, and for those of us who have already been disenchanted,\nwe ought simply to keep the truth to ourselves.\n\nIn direct contrast to illusionism, is disillusionism: the\nview that to the extent that folk intuitions and beliefs about the\nnature of human cognition and moral responsibility are mistaken,\nphilosophers and psychologists ought to do their part to educate the\npublic\u2014especially when their mistaken beliefs arguably fuel a\nnumber of unhealthy emotions and attitudes such as revenge, hatred,\nintolerance, lack of empathy, etc. (Nadelhoffer 2011: 184). Proponents\nof disillusionism typically point to the benefits of a world without\nmoral responsibility. They cite the many instances in which moral\nresponsibility practices are counterproductive from a practical and\nhumanitarian standpoint\u2014notably in how they stifle personal\ndevelopment, encourage punitive excess in criminal justice, and\nperpetuate social and economic inequalities (see Waller 2011; N. Levy\n2012, 2015; Morris, forthcoming). They maintain that if we abandon moral responsibility \u201cwe can look more clearly at the causes and more deeply into the systems that shape individuals and their behavior\u201d (Waller 2011: 287), and this\nwill allow us to adopt more humane and effective interpersonal\nattitudes and approaches to education, criminal justice, and social\npolicy.\n\nA policy of disillusionism is present in the optimistic\nskepticisms of several leading moral responsibility skeptics\n(e.g., Spinoza, Pereboom, Waller, Levy, Caruso, Harris, Vilhauer,\nMilam, and Morris). These optimistic skeptics maintain that life\nwithout basic desert moral responsibility is not only possible, but\nalso preferable. Prospects of finding meaning in life or sustaining\ngood interpersonal relationships, for instance, would not be\nthreatened (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 2011; Sommers 2007a; Milam 2016, 2017). They further maintain that morality and moral judgments would remain intact (see Pereboom 2001, 2014a; Waller 1990, 2004). And although retributivism and severe punishment, such as the death penalty, would\nbe ruled out, they argue that the imposition of sanctions could serves\npurposes other than the punishment of the guilty\u2014e.g., it can\nalso be justified by its role in incapacitating, rehabilitating, and\ndeterring offenders (see Pereboom 2001, 2013b, 2014a; N. Levy 2012,\n2015; Caruso 2016, 2017, forthcoming-a; Pereboom & Caruso\nforthcoming; Corrado 2013, forthcoming-a; Vilhauer 2013a,b; Focquaert,\nGlenn, Raine 2013, forthcoming; Murtagh 2013).\n",
