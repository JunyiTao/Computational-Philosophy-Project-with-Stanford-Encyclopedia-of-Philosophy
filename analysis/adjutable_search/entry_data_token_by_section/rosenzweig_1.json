    "main_text": "Personal and Intellectual Development || Baden-Baden\n1.1 Baden-Baden\n\n\nPerhaps the most important early influence on Rosenzweig\u2019s\nphilosophical development was his cousin, Hans Ehrenberg, whom\nRosenzweig would later claim was \u201cmy real teacher in\nphilosophy.\u201d Ehrenberg was a student of Wilhelm Windelband, and\nhe was a notable figure in the rise of neo-Hegelianism which Windelband\ndescribed, with a mixture of interest and surprise, in his 1910\nlandmark lecture, \u201cDie Erneuerung des\nHegelianismus.\u201d The question of the possibility of a renewal\nof Hegelianism was at the heart of Ehrenberg\u2019s attempt, early in\n1910, to collect some of the brightest young intellectuals, historians,\nand scholars of philosophy from southwest Germany together in\nBaden-Baden for a series of symposia devoted to making\n\u201ccontemporary culture into the object of historical\ncontemplation.\u201d Rosenzweig shared in Ehrenberg\u2019s enthusiasm\nin founding this \u201cBaden-Baden Gesellschaft,\u201d so much so\nthat its subsequent failure had a dramatic effect on his own thinking.\nRosenzweig apparently saw as the task of the Baden-Baden group the\nrevival of a philosophical-historical consciousness that would rival\nwhat Hegel\u2019s \u201cSpirit\u201d had meant for its age.\nTogether, the young Rosenzweig believed, these up-and-coming\nintellectuals would reconcile in science their respective subjectivity\nwith the objectivity of their time. They would take seriously the\nradical individuality of person and specialization of science that\ntypified the age, and would at once forge the \u201cunity\u201d of\nsuch \u201cununifiables\u201d in a holistic vision of\nknowledge and culture befitting the Zeitgeist. But the first,\nand what would end up being the only meeting of the society, appears to\nhave been an abysmal failure precisely because the historians who came\nto the meeting\u2014most of whom were, like Rosenzweig, students of\nMeinecke\u2014could in no way stomach the kind of sweeping,\nmetaphysical account of history leading up to the present that\nRosenzweig sought to revive. The Baden-Baden Gesellschaft dissolved as\nquickly as it was formed.\n\n\nThe failure of the Baden-Baden experiment led Rosenzweig to reach\nwhat he took to be an important conclusion: the individualism of\ncontemporary culture and the specialization of contemporary science\nwere not to be dissolved in an intellectual-spiritual unity of the\npresent. In Rosenzweig\u2019s diagnosis of the failure of\nBaden-Baden, one thereby finds hints towards Rosenzweig\u2019s later\ninsight that for a system of philosophy to grasp particulars as such,\nthe unity of that system must be grasped as future.\n",
