    "main_text": "Three Models of Temporal Consciousness || Methodological Controversies\n1.4 Methodological Controversies\n\nPhilosophers interested in uncovering the temporal properties of\nconsciousness have often found inspiration in scientific findings.\nRecent discussions have featured a wide range of perceptual illusions\nuncovered by psychologists very prominently\u2014in several\nmuch-discussed works Daniel Dennett (1991, Dennett & Kinsbourne\n1992) drew the attention of philosophers to a number of\nexperiments where (seemingly) what we perceive is affected by stimuli\nwhich lie in the future. In his ground-breaking chapter on the\nexperience of time in The Principles of Psychology (1890)\nWilliam James spends much of his time relating relevant work carried\nout by German psychologists such as Exner, Helmolz and Wundt in the\npreceding decades. As a comparatively new science psychology was just\ngetting started in the nineteenth century, but back in 1689 we find\nLocke appealing to proto-scientific data when discussing our\nexperience of duration in his Essay, where Locke points out\nthat objects cannot be seen if they move fast enough (e.g., cannon\nballs), and that a glowing piece of coal appears as a circle when spun\nquickly.\n\nThe question of the extent to which philosophical discussions of\ntemporal experience should be influenced by science is itself a source\nof controversy. Lee recommends a hard-line science-oriented\nmethodological stance:\n\n\nMy view is that the most powerful considerations in this area have to\ndo with the ways in which temporal information is processed in the\nbrain, so that ultimately what is at stake depends on empirical\nconsiderations of a quite general kind. [\u2026] It is worth noting\nat the offset that because I adopt this \u201cbottom-up\u201d\nmethodology, my approach contrasts quite strongly with certain other\nauthors such as Dainton (2000) who argues for views in this area more\non the basis of phenomenological than empirical considerations. (Lee\n2014a: 2)\n\n\nIn the introduction to his Stream of Consciousness Dainton\n(2000) willingly concedes that in attempting to understand\nexperiential unity and continuity his own approach will be exclusively\nphenomenological. He argues that his approach is justified because\nthere exist important experiential structures that are in fact\naccessible to introspection, and we currently have no other way of\naccessing these features. Neuroscience may one day be in a position to\nassist but significant advances will need to be made\u2014indeed\nDainton suggests in\n\n\nsituations in which the phenomenological data conflict with accepted\nscience may well provide valuable clues as to how the relevant science\nmight be revised and improved. (2000: 23).\n\n\nKon and Miller (2015) advocate a middle way between Dainton\u2019s\n\u201ctop-down\u201d phenomenological approach and Lee\u2019s\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d approach rooted in neuroscience. They suggest\nthat advances in our understanding of temporal experience will require\nus to successfully integrate armchair analysis and empirical\nevidence:\n\n\nwe foresee that empirical evidence may significantly modify classic\nmodels these models are still of use: they offer a starting point for\nempirical enquiry by placing key features of our experience into\ncoherent models. Plus, they offer general frameworks in which\nparticular empirical models may be slotted and that potentially have\ntestable consequences. (2015: 215)\n\n\nIf temporal illusions have played a significant role in recent debates\nbut the same cannot be said of the general neuroscientific theories of\nconsciousness\u2014theories which purport to identify the neural\nbasis of consciousness and (more ambitiously) explain how and why\nneural processes produce experiences in all its forms. It is far from\nbeing the case that general theories of this sort do not exist, or are\neven thin on the ground\u2014see Wu (2018) for an introduction to\nseveral. Why have philosophers interested in temporal experience paid\ncomparatively little attention to these theories? Kent and\nWittmann (2021) propose an answer: to a surprising extent the main\ngeneral theories of how consciousness relates to the brain make no\nattempt to explain or accommodate experienced\nsuccession, at most they can explain experienced\nsimultaneity as it features in the briefest of conscious\nepisodes. Northoff and Lamme (2020) review eight leading\nneuroscientific theories of consciousness: global neuronal workspace\ntheory (GNWT), predictive coding theory (PCT), embodied theory (EB),\ntemporospatial theory of consciousness (TTC), integrated information\ntheory (IIT), recurrent processing theory (RPT), synchrony theory (ST)\nand higher-order thought theory (HOT). The majority of these, Kent and\nWittmann argue, focus exclusively on processes in the sub-300 msec\nrange, the sorts of neural processes that are generally thought to\ngive rise to momentary experiences of simultaneity. These leading\ntheories have nothing to say about neural processes occurring over\nlonger intervals, from 300 msec to 3 seconds or more, that it is\nplausible to suppose will be underlie experiences of change and\nsuccession. Only RPT and Northoff\u2019s own TTC offer anything\ndifferent: these theories hold that experienced succession depends on\noscillatory neural process that extend over significant periods of\ntime.\n\nIf Kent and Wittmann are right it\u2019s obvious why general\nneuroscientific theories have\u2014thus far at least\u2014had so\nlittle impact on the philosophical debates. Whereas the latter offer\ncompeting accounts of the experience of temporally extended phenomena\nseemingly stretching over intervals of time, the neuroscientific\ntheories have largely confined themselves to a single experienced\nmoment. If neuroscience starts to move beyond its current very narrow\ntemporal focus its impact will very likely begin to increase.\n\nThese considerations do not mean that it is impossible for the\nphilosophical debates to impact on neuroscience. To focus on just one\nexample, the current incarnation of IIT is quite explicit regarding\nthe narrow temporal confines of consciousness:\n\n\n\u2026 my experience flows at a particular speed\u2014each\nexperience encompassing a hundred milliseconds or so\u2014but I am\nnot having an experience that encompasses just a few milliseconds or\nhours. (Tononi & Koch 2015: 6)\n\n\nSince these brief episodes are discrete and non-overlapping our\nconsciousness is less continuous than commonly thought:\n\n\nAccordingly, the seemingly continuous \u201cstream\u201d of\nconsciousness would actually be constituted by a discrete succession\nof \u201csnapshots\u201d in line with some psychophysical evidence.\n(2015: 16)\n\n\nIn effect Tononi and Koch are committing IIT to a version of the\ncinematic model outlined earlier. This model does have its proponents,\nso this in itself is not problematic. What is more puzzling, as\nSinghal, Mudumba and Srinivasan (2022) point out is that IIT\ndistinguishes itself from other neuroscientific approaches by taking\nphenomenology very seriously indeed. Yet the cinematic model is widely\ntaken to be the most phenomenologically implausible of the leading\ntheories of temporal experience\u2014most of its proponents agree\nthat our ordinary consciousness seems to be deeply continuous. IIT is\ndistinctive by virtue of the singular importance it grants to the\nunity of consciousness, but it makes no attempt to\naccommodate the fact (as many see it) that the unity of consciousness\nextends through time as well as existing at a time. To render IIT\nmaximally phenomenologically plausible these same authors recommend\nthis addition to IIT\u2019s current axioms:\n\n\nexperience always occurs to us as a temporal whole, i.e. experience\nalways has an extension, is continuous and has an inherent direction\nthat is asymmetric. (2022: 14)\n\n\nIf future versions of IIT were to include an axiom along these lines\nit would be an interesting example of phenomenology influencing the\ndevelopment of a neuroscientific theory.\n",
