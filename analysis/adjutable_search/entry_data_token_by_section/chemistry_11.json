    "main_text": "The Chemical Revolution || Phlogiston\n3.2 Phlogiston\n\nAnother substance concept from roughly the same period is phlogiston,\nwhich served as the basis for 18th century theories of processes that\ncame to be called oxidation and reduction. Georg Ernst Stahl\n(1660\u20131734) introduced the theory, drawing on older theoretical\nideas. Alchemists thought that metals lose the mercury principle under\ncalcination and that when substances are converted to slag, rust, or\nash by heating, they lose the sulphur principle. Johann Joackim Becher\n(1635\u201382) modified these ideas at the end of the 17th century,\narguing that the calcination of metals is a kind of combustion\ninvolving the loss of what he called the principle of flammability.\nStahl subsequently renamed this principle \u2018phlogiston\u2019 and\nfurther modified the theory, maintaining that phlogiston could be\ntransferred from one substance to another in chemical reactions, but\nthat it could never be isolated.\n\nFor example, metals were thought to be compounds of the metal\u2019s calx\nand phlogiston, sulphur was thought to be a compound of sulphuric acid\nand phlogiston, and phosphorus was thought to be a compound of\nphosphoric acid and phlogiston. Substances such as carbon which left\nlittle or no ash after burning were taken to be rich in phlogiston.\nThe preparation of metals from their calxes with the aid of wood\ncharcoal was understood as the transfer of phlogiston from carbon to\nthe metal.\n\nRegarding carbon as a source of phlogiston and no longer merely as a\nsource of warmth was a step forward in understanding chemical\nreactions (which Ladyman 2011 emphasizes in support of his structural\nrealist interpretation of phlogiston chemistry). The phlogiston theory\nsuggested that reactions could involve the replacement of one part of\na substance with another, where previously all reactions were thought\nto be simple associations or dissociations.\n\nPhlogiston theory was developed further by Henry Cavendish\n(1731\u20131810) and Joseph Priestley (1733\u20131804), who both\nattempted to better characterize the properties of phlogiston itself.\nAfter 1760, phlogiston was commonly identified with what they called\n\u2018inflammable air\u2019 (hydrogen), which they successfully\ncaptured by reacting metals with muriatic (hydrochloric) acid. Upon\nfurther experimental work on the production and characterizations of\nthese \u201cairs,\u201d Cavendish and Priestley identified what we\nnow call oxygen as \u2018dephlogisticated air\u2019 and nitrogen as\n\u2018phlogiston-saturated air.\u2019\n\nAs reactants and products came to be routinely weighed, it became\nclear that metals gain weight when they become a calx. But according\nto the phlogiston theory, the calx involves the loss of phlogiston.\nAlthough the idea that a process involving the loss of a substance\ncould involve the gain of weight seems strange to us, phlogiston\ntheorists were not immediately worried. Some phlogiston theorists\nproposed explanations based on the \u2018levitation\u2019 properties\nof phlogiston, what Priestly later referred to as phlogiston\u2019s\n\u2018negative weight.\u2019 Another explanation of the phenomenon\nwas that the nearly weightless phlogiston drove out heavy, condensed\nair from the pores of the calx. The net result was a lighter product.\nSince the concept of mass did not yet play a central role in\nchemistry, these explanations were thought to be quite reasonable.\n\nHowever, by the end of the 1770s, Torbern Olaf Bergman\n(1735\u20131784) made a series of careful measurements of the weights\nof metals and their calxes. He showed that the calcination of metals\nled to a gain in their weight equal to the weight of oxygen lost by\nthe surrounding air. This ruled out the two explanations given above,\nbut interestingly, he took this in his stride, arguing that, as metals\nwere being transformed into their calxes, they lost weightless\nphlogiston. This phlogiston combines with the air\u2019s oxygen to form\nponderable warmth, which in turn combines with what remains of the\nmetal after loss of phlogiston to form the calx. Lavoisier simplified\nthis explanation by removing the phlogiston from this scheme. This\nmoment is what many call the Chemical Revolution.\n",
