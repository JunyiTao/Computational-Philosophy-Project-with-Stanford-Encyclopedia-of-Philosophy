    "main_text": "Thinking about Mind Prior to the Twentieth Century || From Descartes to Mill\n4.1 From Descartes to Mill\n\nAs so much of the debate concerning others in the heyday of its\ndiscussion in analytic philosophy in the twentieth century can be read\nas a reaction to Mill\u2019s formulation of the argument from\nanalogy, it is instructive to consider the context for Mill\u2019s\nwork\n here.[16]\n In proposing his argument, Mill was responding to a challenge laid\ndown by the eighteenth century philosopher Thomas Reid who argued that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy, when traced through the work of\nphilosophers such as Malebranche, Locke, Hume and Berkeley, leads to\nsolipsism. In order to avoid this conclusion, Reid argued that\nphilosophers must jettison the Cartesian framework of ideas and its\ntrust in reason over the deliverances of sense. According to Reid, the\nfaculties of reason and perception should be regarded as being on an\nequal footing. Rather than insist that all human belief is regulated\nby reason, Reid holds that we should allow that our perceptions of the\nworld are guided by principles for which no proof can be offered.\nAmongst the regulative principles Reid identifies there are two\nconcerning others: (i) there is life and intelligence in our fellow\nmen; and (ii) certain features of the countenance, sounds of the voice\nand gestures of the body indicate certain thoughts and dispositions of\nmind (Reid 1785). Mill\u2019s work is designed as a defense of the\nCartesian framework in response to Reid\u2019s claim that it leads\ninexorably to solipsism. According to Mill, all truths are known in\none of two ways: either directly, through the authority of\nconsciousness, or indirectly, by inference from truths known directly.\nMill believes that knowledge arrived indirectly in this way is\nsufficient to avoid the concern of solipsism.\n\nWhile there is little direct discussion of this question in\nDescartes\u2019 work, one can find passages devoted to it in\npost-Cartesian\n philosophy.[17]\n Malebranche, for example, differentiates knowledge of one\u2019s own\nmind, of bodies, and of other men\u2019s mind: the first is through\nconsciousness, the second through ideas, and the third through\nconjecture (1674\u20135 [1980: 239]). In the case of another\nman\u2019s sensations, Malebranche first considers the possibility\nthat everyone has the same sensations when confronted with the same\nobjects, but then notes that it can happen that \u201cthe internal\nfibers of the optic nerve do not produce the same sensation for\ndifferent people\u201d (Ibid, 66). Despite this possibility,\nMalebranche thinks there is reason to believe that God arranged things\nso that the same physical conditions do produce the same sensations\n(i.e., that nature is uniform). Nonetheless, he argues that we cannot\nknow another\u2019s sensations as there is \u201ca great deal of\ndiversity in different people\u2019s organs of sight as well as of\nhearing and taste\u201d\n (ibid).[18]\n Writing in response to Malebranche, Arnauld (1683) insists that we do\nknow other men\u2019s minds through ideas: we have ideas of their\nbodies and must reason from these to the conclusion that they have\nminds. In Arnauld\u2019s work we have, arguably, an early formulation\nof the argument from analogy.\n\nIt may be worth remembering that, in so far as Descartes\u2019\nphilosophy raises a problem about other minds, it is a thick or\nradical sceptical problem. What one finds in Malebranche\u2019s work\nis a thin sceptical problem. Malebranche appears to take it for\ngranted that others have minds; what interests him is whether the\nsensations that others feel are the same as those that I feel. John\nLocke follows Malebrance in not taking seriously the thick or radical\nsceptical problem here. Locke asks whether the idea produced in one\nman\u2019s mind by a violet may not be exactly the same as the idea\nproduced in another man\u2019s mind by a marigold (Locke 1689, II,\nxxxii, 15). But as Locke is concerned less with the\n\u201cmetaphysical Sense of the word Truth\u201d and more with\n\u201cthe more ordinary Acceptation of those words\u201d he allows\nthat \u201cthe sensible Ideas, produced by any Object in\ndifferent Men\u2019s Minds, are most commonly very near and\nundiscernible alike\u201d (Locke 1689, II, XXXii, 13 & 15). \n\nThe threat of solipsism is particularly problematic for the idealism\nof George Berkeley. Without proof of other minds, idealism will amount\nto nothing but solipsism. Berkeley admits that I cannot have immediate\nevidence of the mind of another; what he holds is that there is\n\u201ca certain collection of ideas, as directs us to think there is\na distinct principle of thought and motion like until ourselves,\naccompanying and represented by it\u201d (Berkeley 1710: Principle\n148). While some find in Berkeley\u2019s work another early\nformulation of the argument from analogy (Urmson 1982), others argue\nthat his work should be read as putting forwards a causal argument: in\nthe case of God, I reason that He is the cause or Author of everything\nin nature that I see around me; in the case of other finite spirits, I\nreason that they are the cause of the movements in the bodies I\nobserve and the words that I hear (Bennett 1971 and Falkenstein\n1990).\n\nSome philosophers also find an argument from analogy in the work of\nDavid Hume, while others interpret his work in a more naturalistic\nvein. One thing that cannot be denied is that Hume introduces an\nimportant element into the discussion of others when he writes in\nThe Treatise, \u201cNo quality of human nature is more\nremarkable, both in itself and in its consequences, than that\npropensity we have to sympathize with others\u201d (1738\u201340\n[1888: 316]). It is by means of sympathy that we are affected by the\npassions and mental states of others, which otherwise \u201cremain\nconcealed in the minds of others\u201d (ibid, 593).\nPrecisely how this remarkable capacity operates is a matter of some\ndebate. There are those who agree with Reid and find Hume unable to\nescape the confines of his own mind. These philosophers argue that\nHume recognizes the problem of other minds that arises for the\nCartesian framework that he endorses, and holds that sympathy can do\nno more than get us to feel our own feelings in response to what we\nobserve in the other. But there are others who take Hume to turn his\nback on scepticism and the very business of providing reasons for the\nbelief that others have thoughts and feelings. They read Hume\u2019s\nwork as giving us a psychological account of how it is that we are\nable to understand the thoughts and feelings of our fellow men through\nthe operation of sympathy (Greco 2012; see also work by Waldow\n2009).\n\nHume\u2019s understanding of the working of sympathy was challenged\nby his contemporary Adam Smith. Smith rejects the idea that I can feel\nwhat another feels. He writes,\n\n\nThough our brother is upon the rack, as long as we ourselves are at\nour ease, our senses will never inform us of what he suffers. They\nnever did, and never can, carry us beyond our own person, and it is by\nthe imagination only that we can form any conception of what are his\nsensations\u2026.\n\n\nA little later he writes,\n\n\nThat this is the source of our fellow-feeling for the misery of\nothers, that it is by changing places in fancy with the sufferer, that\nwe come either to conceive or to be affected by what he feels, may be\ndemonstrated by many obvious observations, if it should not be thought\nsufficiently evident of itself. (1759: I.i.i.2\u20133)\n\n\nWith Smith\u2019s work we take a step closer to the work of the\nsimulation theorists of more recent times (cf.\n \u00a73.1).\n\nIt is Reid\u2019s contention that, so long as one is working within a\nCartesian framework of ideas, our relations to others must be a taken\nto be a matter of probability, hypothesis, or conjecture, and this he\ntakes to be at odds with the conviction with which, for example, the\nchild interacts with her nurse. While the Cartesian recognizes only\nthe solitary operations of mind, Reid proposes that we also recognize\nthe social operations of mind (Reid 1785 [1969: 71]).\n",
