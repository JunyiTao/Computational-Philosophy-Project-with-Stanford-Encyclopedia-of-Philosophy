According to this approach, often\ncalled \u201copen theism\u201d, there may be future contingent\nevents, but God does not know about them. God does not know about them\neither because (1) there are no true propositions now that report what\nfuture contingent events will occur, or because (2) it is impossible\nfor anyone, including God, to know such true propositions, or because\n(3) God chooses not to know them in order to preserve our freedom\n(see, e.g., Swinburne 1986, chapter 10). Open theists also typically\nargue that foreknowledge alone would be providentially useless to God\n(see Hasker 1989, for instance; for more on open theism, see Hasker\n1989 and 2004, Basinger and Basinger 1986, Basinger 1994, Pinnock\n1986, Pinnock et al 1994, Rice 1985, and Davison 1991 and 2003). How\ncan open theism explain prophecies that appear to make reference to\nfuture contingent events?\n\nWilliam Hasker, perhaps the most prominent advocate of open theism,\naddresses this problem explicitly, and suggests a three-fold response.\nFirst, he points out that the main function of prophecy is not to\nforetell the future, but to reveal God\u2019s will (Hasker 1989,\n194). Many prophecies, in fact, have a conditional character, such as\n\u201cIf a nation does not do such and such, then it will be\ndestroyed\u201d (see Jeremiah 18:7\u201310, for example). Second,\nmany prophetic predictions are based upon existing trends and\ntendencies, which provide God with enough evidence to foresee the\nfuture (Hasker 1989, 195). (Hasker places Jesus\u2019 prediction\nabout Peter in this category, by the way.) Finally, some prophecies\nsimply reveal what God has already decided to bring about in the\nfuture (Hasker 1989, 195). Since God\u2019s own actions in the future\nare up to God, it is possible for God to know about them even though\nthey are contingent, so it is possible for prophecies to reveal\nthem.\n\nThomas P. Flint argues that Hasker\u2019s attempt to solve the\nproblem of prophecy from within the constraints imposed by open theism\nis inadequate. Flint argues that if people are truly free in a sense\nthat implies future contingency, then not even God could know very\nmuch about the future based upon present trends and tendencies alone.\nThis is because the probability of a particular future contingent\nevent is very low (when it is identified in some detail), so low that\nGod would not have much justification for believing that it would\noccur specifically (see Flint 1998, 102\u20135). As an example, Flint\npoints to John 6:64, which seems to imply that Jesus knew that Judas\nwould betray him. How could this be, Flint wonders, when the\nprobability that Judas would betray Jesus was so low? He also points\nout that Hasker faces a dilemma here that other open theists share,\nnamely, that if they insist that the probabilities of future\ncontingent events are high enough to justify God in making predictions\nabout the future, then God actually doesn\u2019t take much of a risk\nin creating the world. This is problematic for some open theists, who\nclaim that their view has the virtue that God takes certain risks in\ncreating the world; see Flint 1998, 104\u20136.)\n\nWe will not try to adjudicate the dispute between Flint and Hasker\nhere, since that would take us beyond the scope of this article.\nInstead, let\u2019s consider other possible solutions to the problem\nof prophecy. In order to classify them, it will be helpful to describe\nbriefly the different ways that philosophers and theologians have\ntried to explain God\u2019s knowledge of the contingent future.\n",
