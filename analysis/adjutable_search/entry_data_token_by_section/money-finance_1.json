    "main_text": "Metaphysics || What is Finance?\n1.2 What is Finance?\n\nOne may view \u201cfinance\u201d more generally (that is, the\nfinancial sector or system) as an extension of the monetary system. It\nis typically said that the financial sector has two main functions:\n(1) to maintain an effective payments system; and (2) to facilitate an\nefficient use of money. The latter function can be broken down further\ninto two parts. First, to bring together those with excess money\n(savers, investors) and those without it (borrowers, enterprises),\nwhich is typically done through financial intermediation (the inner\nworkings of banks) or financial markets (such as stock or bond\nmarkets). Second, to create opportunities for market participants to\nbuy and sell money, which is typically done through the invention of\nfinancial products, or \u201cassets\u201d, with features\ndistinguished by different levels of risk, return, and maturation.\n\nThe modern financial system can thus be seen as an infrastructure\nbuilt to facilitate transactions of money and other financial assets,\nas noted at the outset. It is important to note that it contains both\nprivate elements (such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and\ninvestment funds) and public elements (such as central banks and\nregulatory authorities). \u201cFinance\u201d can also refer to the\nsystematic study of this system; most often to the field of financial\neconomics (see\n section 3).\n\nFinancial assets: Of interest from an ontological\nviewpoint is that modern finance consists of several other\n\u201casset types\u201d besides money; central examples include\ncredit arrangements (bank accounts, bonds), equity (shares or stocks),\nderivatives (futures, options, swaps, etc.) and funds (trusts). What\nare the defining characteristics of financial assets?\n\nThe typical distinction here is between financial and\n\u201creal\u201d assets, such as buildings and machines (Fabozzi\n2002), because financial assets are less tangible or concrete. Just\nlike money, they can be viewed as a social construction. Financial\nassets are often derived from or at least involve underlying\n\u201creal\u201d assets\u2014as, for example, in the relation\nbetween owning a house and investing in a housing company. However,\nfinancial transactions are different from ordinary market trades in\nthat the underlying assets seldom change hands, instead one exchanges\nabstract contracts or promises of future transactions. In this sense,\none may view the financial market as the \u201cmeta-level\u201d of\nthe economy, since it involves indirect trade or speculation on the\nsuccess of other parts of the economy.\n\nMore distinctly, financial assets are defined as promises of future\nmoney payments (Mishkin 2016, Pilbeam 2010). If the credit theory of\nmoney is correct, they can be regarded as meta-promises: promises on\npromises. The level of abstraction can sometimes become enormous: For\nexample, a \u201csynthetic collateralized debt obligation\u201d (or\n\u201csynthetic CDO\u201d), a form of derivative common before the\nfinancial crisis, is a promise from person A (the seller) to\nperson B (the buyer) that some persons C to\nI (speculators) will pay an amount of money depending on the\nlosses incurred by person J (the holder of an underlying\nderivative), which typically depend on certain portions (so-called\ntranches) of the cash flow from persons K to Q\n(mortgage borrowers) originally promised to persons R to\nX (mortgage lenders) but then sold to person Y (the\noriginator of the underlying derivative). The function of a synthetic\nCDO is mainly to spread financial risks more thinly between different\nspeculators.\n\nIntrinsic value: Perhaps the most important\ncharacteristic of financial assets is that their price can\nvary enormously with the attitudes of investors. Put simply, there are\ntwo main factors that determine the price of a financial asset: (i)\nthe credibility or strength of the underlying promise (which will\ndepend on the future cash flows generated by the asset); and (ii) its\ntransferability or popularity within the market, that is, how many\nother investors are interested in buying the asset. In the process\nknown as \u201cprice discovery\u201d, investors assess these factors\nbased on the information available to them, and then make bids to buy\nor sell the asset, which in turn sets its price on the market (Mishkin\n2016, Pilbeam 2010).\n\nA philosophically interesting question is whether there is such a\nthing as an \u201cintrinsic\u201d value of financial assets, as is\noften assumed in discussions about financial crises. For example, a\ncommon definition of an \u201casset bubble\u201d is that this is a\nsituation that occurs when certain assets trade at a price that\nstrongly exceed their intrinsic value\u2014which is dangerous since\nthe bubble can burst and cause an economic shock (Kindleberger 1978,\nMinsky 1986, Reinhart & Rogoff 2009). But what is the intrinsic\nvalue of an asset? The rational answer seems to be that this depends\nonly on the discounted value of the underlying future cash\nflow\u2014in other words, on (i) and not (ii) above. However, someone\nstill has to assess these factors to compute a price, and this\nassessment inevitably includes subjective elements. As just noted, it\nis assumed that different investors have different valuations of\nfinancial assets, which is why they can engage in trades on the market\nin the first place.\n\nA further complication here is that (i) may actually be influenced by\n(ii). The fundamentals may be influenced by investors\u2019\nperceptions of them, which is a phenomenon known as\n\u201creflexivity\u201d (Soros 1987, 2008). For example, a company\nwhose shares are popular among investors will often find it easier to\nborrow more money and thereby to expand its cash flow, in turn making\nit even more popular among investors. Conversely, when the\ncompany\u2019s profits start to fall it may lose popularity among\ninvestors, thereby making its loans more expensive and its profits\neven lower. This phenomenon amplifies the risks posed by financial\nbubbles (Keynes 1936).\n",
