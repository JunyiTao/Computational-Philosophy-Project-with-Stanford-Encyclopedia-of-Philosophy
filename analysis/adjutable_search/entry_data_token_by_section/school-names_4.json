    "main_text": "Deng Xi\n3. Deng Xi\n\nDeng Xi (d. 501 B.C.E.) was China\u2019s earliest renowned lawyer and\nrhetorician. He has been called the \u201cfounding father of the\nChinese logical tradition\u201d (Harbsmeier 1998: 286), though this\nis probably an overstatement, since we lack evidence that he undertook\nany explicit study of argumentation or that he influenced the theories\nof the Mohists or Xunzi. As Harbsmeier (287) rightly points out,\nhowever, Deng Xi epitomizes the roots of Chinese disputation in legal\nrhetoric. He establishes a link between disputation and litigation\nthat continues throughout the classical period. Indeed, his reputation\nas a legal and political gadfly may have contributed to later\nauthoritarian thinkers\u2019 attitude that litigators disrupt social\norder and should be banned. \n\nAll of our very limited information about Deng Xi is second-hand,\ncomprising a one-line entry in the Zuo Commentary, curt\nattacks on him in the Xunzi, three anecdotes in The\nAnnals of L\u00fc Buwei, and a few stories in texts of later\n date.[8]\n According to the Han History, he was the author of two\nscrolls (pian) of writings, neither of which survives. The\nZuo Commentary (Duke Ding, Year 9), the earliest and most\nreliable of our sources, reports that he composed a penal code on\nbamboo strips, perhaps drawn up as an alternative to the official code\nof his home state of Zheng. By the time of the Han dynasty, however,\nthe code had been lost. \n\nXunzi alludes to Deng Xi\u2019s thought in three places, each time\npairing him with\n Hui Shi,\n though the men were from different states and lived about 200 years\napart. This incongruity suggests that the pair are being used\niconically to represent a certain general intellectual style or\norientation. Thus the sophistries Xunzi ascribes to them may not be\ntheir invention, or at least not Deng Xi\u2019s. Xunzi describes them\nas \u201cfond of dealing with strange doctrines and playing with\nbizarre expressions\u201d (6.6), of which he gives these examples\n(3.1):\n\nMountains and abysses are level. \nHeaven and earth are alongside each other.\nQi [on the east coast] and Qin [in the far west] are\nadjacent.\nEnter through the ear.\nExit through the mouth.\nHooks have whiskers.\nEggs have feathers.\n\n\nThe first two of these are similar to paradoxes attributed to Hui Shi\nin \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d (Zhuangzi, Book 33); we will\ndiscuss them in the section on\n Hui Shi.\n The seventh is also listed in \u201cUnder Heaven,\u201d but not\nattributed to Hui Shi there. This suggests that the list of paradoxes\nassociated with him was still fluid at the time of Xunzi\u2019s\nwriting. The third is similar to the spatial paradoxes of Hui Shi,\nalso to be discussed below. The sixth is obscure; some commentators\nemend \u201chooks\u201d to a similar graph for \u201cold\nwomen.\u201d The fourth and fifth are puzzling, since they are not\nobviously paradoxes or sophisms. Commentators often combine them into\na single sentence, but in the text all seven seem to be independent,\nthree-word sentences. \n\nXunzi\u2019s fundamental complaint about Hui Shi and Deng Xi is that\ntheir \u201cfrivolous investigations\u201d do not conform to\ntraditional ritual propriety and righteousness (3.1), an unsurprising\ncriticism given the Confucian\u2019s commitment to ritual\ntraining\u2014and thus conventional standards for the correct use of\nnames\u2014along with his general disdain for science and\nintellectual curiosity (12.3). They are \u201cincisive\u201d and\n\u201cclever,\u201d but their ideas are \u201cuseless,\u201d yield\nfew concrete results, and have no application to government (6.6).\nThey have \u201cno regard for the facts about right and wrong, so and\nnot-so\u201d (8.3). In the eyes of a 3rd-century B.C.E. Confucian\ntraditionalist, then, the 6th-century Deng Xi was emblematic of a\nbright, talented person who wastes his energy on pointless\nintellectual games and sophistry, perhaps with a deliberate disregard\nfor the truth, instead of earnestly committing himself to moral\ntraining and political administration.\n\nFor an account of Deng Xi\u2019s legal and political career, see this\nsupplementary document:\n\nDeng Xi\u2019s Exploits\n\n",
