    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nMartin Heidegger was born in Messkirch, Germany, on September 26,\n1889. Messkirch was then a quiet, conservative, religious rural town,\nand as such was a formative influence on Heidegger and his\nphilosophical thought. In 1909 he spent two weeks in the Jesuit order\nbefore leaving (probably on health grounds) to study theology at the\nUniversity of Freiburg. In 1911 he switched subjects, to philosophy. He\nbegan teaching at Freiburg in 1915. In 1917 he married Elfride Petri,\nwith whom he had two sons (J\u00f6rg and Hermann) and from whom he\nnever parted (although his affair with the philosopher Hannah Arendt,\nhis student at Marburg in the 1920s, is well-known).\n\n\nHeidegger's philosophical development began when he read\nBrentano and Aristotle, plus the latter's medieval scholastic\ninterpreters. Indeed, Aristotle's demand in the\nMetaphysics to know what it is that unites all possible modes\nof Being (or \u2018is-ness\u2019) is, in many ways, the question that\nignites and drives Heidegger's philosophy. From this platform he\nproceeded to engage deeply with Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and,\nperhaps most importantly of all for his subsequent thinking in the\n1920s, two further figures: Dilthey (whose stress on the role of\ninterpretation and history in the study of human activity profoundly\ninfluenced Heidegger) and Husserl (whose understanding of phenomenology\nas a science of essences he was destined to reject). In 1915 Husserl\ntook up a post at Freiburg and in 1919 Heidegger became his assistant.\nHeidegger spent a period (of reputedly brilliant) teaching at the\nUniversity of Marburg (1923\u20131928), but then returned to Freiburg to\ntake up the chair vacated by Husserl on his retirement. Out of such\ninfluences, explorations, and critical engagements, Heidegger's\nmagnum opus, Being and Time (Sein und Zeit) was born.\nAlthough Heidegger's academic and intellectual relationship with\nhis Freiburg predecessor was complicated and occasionally strained (see\nCrowell 2005), Being and Time was dedicated to Husserl,\n\u201cin friendship and admiration\u201d.\n\n\nPublished in 1927, Being and Time is standardly hailed as\none of the most significant texts in the canon of (what has come to be\ncalled) contemporary European (or Continental) Philosophy. It\ncatapulted Heidegger to a position of international intellectual\nvisibility and provided the philosophical impetus for a number of later\nprogrammes and ideas in the contemporary European tradition, including\nSartre's existentialism, Gadamer's philosophical\nhermeneutics, and Derrida's notion of\n\u2018deconstruction\u2019. Moreover, Being and Time, and indeed\nHeidegger's philosophy in general, has been presented and engaged\nwith by thinkers such as Dreyfus (e.g., 1990) and Rorty (e.g., 1991a, b)\nwho work somewhere near the interface between the contemporary European and the analytic traditions. A\ncross-section of broadly analytic reactions to Heidegger (positive and\nnegative) may be found alongside other responses in (Murray 1978).\nBeing and Time is discussed in section 2 of this article.\n\n\nIn 1933 Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and was elected Rector of\nFreiburg University, where, depending on whose account one believes, he\neither enthusiastically implemented the Nazi policy of bringing\nuniversity education into line with Hitler's nauseating political\nprogramme (Pattison 2000) or he allowed that policy to be officially\nimplemented while conducting a partially underground campaign of\nresistance to some of its details, especially its anti-Semitism (see\nHeidegger's own account in Only a God can\nSave Us). During the short period of his rectorship\u2014he resigned in 1934\u2014Heidegger gave a number of public speeches\n(including his inaugural rectoral address; see below) in which Nazi\nimages plus occasional declarations of support for Hitler are\nintegrated with the philosophical language of Being and Time.\nAfter 1934 Heidegger became increasingly distanced from Nazi politics.\nAlthough he didn't leave the Nazi party, he did attract some\nunwelcome attention from its enthusiasts. After the war, however, a\nuniversity denazification committee at Freiburg investigated Heidegger\nand banned him from teaching, a right which he did not get back until\n1949. One year later he was made professor Emeritus. Against this\nbackground of contrary information, one will search in vain through\nHeidegger's later writings for the sort of total and unambiguous\nrepudiation of National Socialism that one might hope to find. The\nphilosophical character of Heidegger's involvement with Nazism is\ndiscussed later in this article.\n\n\nAfter Being and Time there is a reorienting shift in\nHeidegger's philosophy known as \u2018the turn\u2019 (die\nKehre). Exactly when this occurs is a matter of debate, although\nit is probably safe to say that it is in progress by 1930 and largely\nestablished by the early 1940s. If dating the turn has its problems,\nsaying exactly what it involves is altogether more challenging. Indeed,\nHeidegger himself characterized it not as a turn in his own thinking\n(or at least in his thinking alone) but as a turn in Being. As he later\nput it in a preface he wrote to Richardson's ground-breaking text\non his work (Richardson 1963), the \u201cKehre is at work\nwithin the issue [that is named by the titles \u2018Being and\nTime\u2019/\u2018Time and Being.\u2019]\u2026 It is not something\nthat I did, nor does it pertain to my thinking only\u201d. The core\nelements of the turn are indicated in what is now considered by many\ncommentators to be Heidegger's second greatest work,\nContributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), (Beitrage zur\nPhilosophie (Vom Ereignis)). This uncompromising text was written\nin 1936\u20137, but was not published in German until 1989 and not in\nEnglish translation until 1999. Section 3 of this article will attempt\nto navigate the main currents of the turn, and thus of\nHeidegger's later philosophy, in the light of this increasingly\ndiscussed text.\n\n\nHeidegger died in Freiburg on May 26, 1976. He was buried in\nMesskirch.\n",
