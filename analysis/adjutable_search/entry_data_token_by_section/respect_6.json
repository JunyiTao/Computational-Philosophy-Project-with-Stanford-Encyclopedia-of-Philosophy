    "main_text": "Respect for Persons || Further issues, developments, and applications\n2.3 Further issues, developments, and applications\n\nPhilosophical discussions of respect since Kant have tended, on the\none hand, to develop or apply various aspects of it, or on the other,\nto take issue with it or develop alternative accounts of respect. Some\nof the discussions have focused on more theoretical issues. For\nexample, Kant gives the notion of respect for persons a central and\nvital role in moral theory. One issue that has since concerned\nphilosophers is whether respect for persons is the definitive focus of\nmorality, either in the sense that moral rightness and goodness and\nhence all specific moral duties, rights, and virtues are explainable\nin terms of respect or in the sense that the supreme moral principle\nfrom which all other principles are derived is a principle of respect\nfor persons. Some philosophers have developed ethical theories in\nwhich a principle of respect for persons is identified as the\nfundamental and comprehensive moral requirement (for example, Donagan\n1977; Downie and Telfer 1969). Others (for example, Hill 1993;\nFrankena 1986; Cranor 1975) argue that while respect for persons is\nsurely a very important moral consideration, it cannot be the\nprinciple from which the rest of morality is deduced. They maintain\nthat there are moral contexts in which respect for persons is not an\nissue and that there are other dimensions of our moral relations with\nothers that seem not to reduce to respect. Moreover, they argue, such\na principle would seem not to provide moral grounds for believing that\nwe ought to treat mentally incapacitated humans or nonhuman animals\ndecently, or would (as Kant argues) make a duty to respect such beings\nonly an indirect duty\u2014one we have only because it is a way of\nrespecting persons who value such beings or because our duty to\nrespect ourselves requires that we not engage in activities that would\ndull our ability to treat persons decently\u2014rather than a direct\nduty to such beings (Metaphysics of Morals, 6:443).\n\nSome theorists maintain that utilitarianism, a moral theory generally\nthought to be a rival to Kant\u2019s theory, is superior with regard\nto this last point. A utilitarian might argue that it is sentience\nrather than the capacity for rational autonomy that is the ground of\nmoral recognition respect, and so would regard mentally incapacitated\nhumans and nonhuman animals as having moral standing and so as worthy\nof at least some moral respect in themselves. Another issue, then, is\nwhether utilitarianism (or more generally, consequentialism) can\nindeed accommodate a principle of respect for persons. In opposition\nto the utilitarian claim, some Kantians argue that Kant\u2019s ethics\nis distinguishable from consequentialist ethics precisely in\nmaintaining that the fundamental demand of morality is not that we\npromote some value, such as the happiness of sentient beings, but that\nwe respect the worth of humanity regardless of the consequences of\ndoing so (Wood 1999; Korsgaard 1996). Thus, some philosophers argue\nthat utilitarianism is inconsistent with respect for persons, inasmuch\nas utilitarianism, in requiring that all actions, principles, or\nmotives promote the greatest good, requires treating persons as mere\nmeans on those occasions when doing so maximizes utility, whereas the\nvery point of a principle of respect for persons is to rule out such\ntrading of persons and their dignity for some other value (Benn 1988,\nBrody 1982). In opposition, other theorists maintain not only that a\nconsequentialist theory can accommodate the idea of respect for\npersons (Cummiskey 2008, 1990; Pettit 1989; Gruzalski 1982; Landesman\n1982; Downie and Telfer 1969), but also that utilitarianism is\nderivable from a principle of respect for persons (Downie and Telfer\n1969) and that consequentialist theories provide a better grounding\nfor duties to respect persons (Pettit 1989).\n\nIn addition to the debate between Kantian theory and utilitarianism,\ntheoretical work has also been done in developing the role of respect\nfor persons in Habermasian communicative ethics (Young 1997; Benhabib\n1991) and in exploring respect in the ethics of other philosophers,\nincluding ancient Greek poets (Giorgini 2017), Plato (Rowe 2017),\nAristotle (Thompson 2017; Weber 2017; Rabb\u00e5s 2015; Jacobs 1995;\nPreus 1991), Hobbes (2017), Hegel (Laitinen 2017; Moland 2002), and\nMill (Loizides 2017). Cross-cultural explorations include discussions\nof similarities and differences between western (Kantian) views of\nrespect for persons and Indian (Ghosh-Dastidar 1987), Confucian (Liu\n2019; Lu 2017; Chan 2006; Wawrytko 1982), and Taoist views (Wong\n1984). Several theorists have developed distinctively feminist account\nof respect for persons (Farley 1993; Dillon 1992a).\n\nOther philosophical discussions have been concerned with clarifying\nthe nature of the respect that is owed to persons and of the persons\nthat are owed respect. Some of these discussions aim to refine and\ndevelop Kant\u2019s account, while others criticize it, or offer\nalternatives. One significant non-Kantian account is Pettit\u2019s\nconversive theory of respect for persons (Pettit 2021, 2015). An\ninfluential development of the Kantian account is Darwall\u2019s\nsecond-personal account (2021, 2015, 2008, 2006, 2004), according to\nwhich the regulation of conduct that moral recognition respect\ninvolves arises from our directly acknowledging each other as equal\npersons who have the moral authority to address moral demands to one\nanother that each of us is morally obligated to accept. The reciprocal\nrelations of persons as authoritative claims-makers and mutually\naccountable claims-responders is, in Darwall\u2019s view, one way of\nunderstanding what Kant calls in the Groundwork a\n\u201ckingdom of ends.\u201d\n\nAnother area of interest has been the connections between respect and\nother attitudes and emotions, especially love and between respect and\nvirtues such as trust. For example, Kant argues that we have duties of\nlove to others just as we have duties of respect. However, neither the\nlove nor the respect we owe is a matter of feeling (or, is\npathological, as Kant says), but is, rather, a duty to adopt a certain\nkind of maxim, or policy of action: the duty of love is the duty to\nmake the ends of others my own, the duty of respect is the duty to not\ndegrade others to the status of mere means to my ends (Metaphysics\nof Morals, 6: 449\u2013450). Love and respect, in Kant\u2019s\nview, are intimately united in friendship; nevertheless, they are in\ntension with one another and respect seems to be the morally more\nimportant of the two. Critics object to what they see here as\nKant\u2019s devaluing of emotions, maintaining that emotions are\nmorally significant dimensions of persons both as subjects and as\nobjects of both respect and love. In response, some philosophers\ncontend that respect and love are more similar and closely connected\nin Kant\u2019s theory than is generally recognized (Bagnoli 2003;\nVelleman 1999; Baron 1997; R. Johnson 1997). Others have developed\naccounts of respect that is or incorporates a form of love (agape) or\ncare (Dillon 1992a; Downie and Telfer 1969; Maclagan 1960), and some\nhave argued that emotions are included among the bases of dignity and\nthat a complex emotional repertoire is necessary for Kantian respect\n(Wood 1999; Sherman 1998a; Farley 1993). In a related vein, some\nphilosophers maintain that it is possible to acknowledge that another\nbeing is a person, i.e., a rational moral agent, and yet not have or\ngive respect to that being. What is required for respecting a person\nis not simply recognizing what they are but emotionally experiencing\ntheir value as a person (Thomas 2001a; Buss 1999b; Dillon 1997). Other\nattitudes, emotions, and virtues whose connections with respect have\nbeen discussed are toleration (for example, Carter 2013; Deveaux 1998;\nAddis 2004), forgiveness (for example, Holmgren 1993), good manners\n(Stohr 2012; Buss 1999a), esteem (for example, Brennan and Pettit\n1997), reverence (Woodruff 2003, 2001), honor (Darwall 2015), and\nappreciation (Hill 2021). Work has also been done on attitudes and\nemotions that are (usually taken to be) opposed to respect, such as\narrogance (Dillon 2003) and contempt (Miceli and Castelfranci 2018;\nMason 2017; Bell 2013).\n\nAnother source of dissatisfaction with Kant\u2019s account has been\nwith his characterization of persons and the quality in virtue of\nwhich they must be respected. In particular, Kant\u2019s view that\nthe rational will which is common to all persons is the ground of\nrespect is thought to ignore the moral importance of the concrete\nparticularity of each individual, and his emphasis on autonomy, which\nis often understood to involve the independence of one person from all\nothers, is thought to ignore the essential relationality of human\nbeings (for example, Noggle 1999; Farley 1993; Dillon 1992a; E.\nJohnson 1982). Rather than ignoring what distinguishes one person from\nanother, it is argued, respect should involve attending to each person\nas a distinctive individual and to the concrete realities of human\nlives, and it should involve valuing difference as well as sameness\nand interdependence as well as independence. Other critics respond\nthat respecting differences and particular identities inevitably\nreintroduces hierarchical discrimination that is antithetical to the\nequality among persons that the idea of respect for persons is\nsupposed to express (for example, Bird 2004). Identity and difference\nmay, however, be appropriate objects of other forms of consideration\nand appreciation.\n\nThe ideas of mutual respect or disrespect and respect for\nparticularity and relationality has also become an important topic in\nmoral and political philosophy. Helm has argued that a\n\u201ccommunity of respect\u201d is essential to understanding what\na person is (Helm 2017). Margalit argues that humiliation, both\ndisrespect and the result of being disrespected, is a form of\nexclusion of individuals from the good of community (Margalit 1996).\nOne issue is how persons ought to be respected in multicultural\nliberal democratic societies (for example, Balint 2006; Tomasi 1995;\nC. Taylor 1992; Kymlicka 1989). Respect for persons is one of the\nbasic tenets of liberal democratic societies, which are founded on the\nideal of the equal dignity of all citizens and which realize this\nideal in the equalization of rights and entitlements among all\ncitizens and so the rejection of discrimination and differential\ntreatment. Some writers argue that respecting persons requires\nrespecting the traditions and cultures that permeate and shape their\nindividual identities (Addis 1997). But as the citizenry of such\nsocieties becomes increasingly more diverse and as many groups come to\nregard their identities or very existence as threatened by a\nhomogenizing equality, liberal societies face the question of whether\nthey should or could respond to demands to respect the unique identity\nof individuals or groups by differential treatment, such as extending\npolitical rights or opportunities to some cultural groups (for\nexample, Native Americans, French Canadians, African-Americans) and\nnot others. Some of these discussions are carried out in terms of\nrecognition rather than of respect, although some theorists contrast\nrecognition and respect (McBride 2013). Honneth develops a broader,\ncritical account of recognition that argues for a harmonious\nrelationship among universal (recognition) respect, esteem, and love,\narguing that each is essential for the development of positive\nrelations towards ourselves (Honneth 2007, 1995).\n\nThe idea that all persons are owed respect has been applied in a wide\nvariety of contexts. For instance, some philosophers employ it to\njustify various positions in normative ethics, such as the claim that\npersons have moral rights (Benn 1971; Feinberg 1970; Downie and Telfer\n1969) or duties (Fried 1978; Rawls 1971), or to argue for principles\nof equality (Williams 1962), justice (Narveson 2002a, 2002b; Nussbaum\n1999), and education (Andrews 1976). Others appeal to respect for\npersons in addressing a wide variety of practical issues such as\nabortion, racism and sexism, rape, punishment, physician-assisted\nsuicide, pornography, affirmative action, forgiveness, terrorism,\nsexual harassment, cooperation with injustice, treatment of gays and\nlesbians, sexual ethics, and many others. In political philosophy,\nrespect for persons has been used to examine issues of global\ninequality (e.g., Moellendorf 2010). One very important application\ncontext is biomedical ethics, where the principle of respect for\nautonomy is one of four basic principles that have become \u201cthe\nbackbone of contemporary Western health care ethics\u201d (Brannigan\nand Boss 2001, 39; see also Beauchamp and Childress 1979/2001 and, for\nexample, Kerstein 2021; Munson 2000; Beauchamp and Walters 1999). The\nidea of respect for patient autonomy has transformed health care\npractice, which had traditionally worked on physician-based\npaternalism, and the principle enters into issues such as informed\nconsent, truth-telling, confidentiality, respecting refusals of\nlife-saving treatment, the use of patients as subjects in medical\nexperimentation, and so on.\n",
