    "main_text": "Describing an Instance of Theater || Ontological Questions\n2.1 Ontological Questions\n\nWhat is a work of art? Are all works of art alike? How so, or how not?\nWhen asked to determine what sentences are about, philosophers often\nwill want to know what objects, properties, or relationships the\nobjects of a certain bit of human discourse are and what the referents\nof its nominal and pronominal phrases are. The answers to these\nquestions might well be taken to be the basic ontology of that\ndiscourse. In this sense, the word \u201contology\u201d is playing\nthe same role it plays in, for example, computer science: and it\nanswers the question, \u201cWhat is there?\u201d The most common\npractice in doing ontology of art is to use a roughly Quinean approach\n(Quine 1948) since it seems a fairly pragmatic way to undertake the\ninitial task in the ontology of art (see Pettersson 2009 for a detailed discussion).\nDissenters from this common practice have often pursued mereological\naccounts (in terms of parts and wholes) of how certain ostensible\n\u201cmultiple instances\u201d of works of art are related to the\nworks themselves (Cook 2011; Hackett 2017).\n\nBut some cast doubt on the utility of terms like \u201cworks of\nart\u201d and \u201cartworks\u201d altogether, arguing that, at\nleast with respect to literary and musical communication, the choices\nopen to us seem to be language-dependent in a way that makes it\ndubious to construe them as elements in \u201cthe basic furniture of\nthe world\u201d, so to speak, even if there is nothing intrinsically\nproblematic within our ordinary descriptions of art using these terms\n(Rudner 1950; Cameron 2008; Pettersson 2009; but for arguments for the\nindispensability of works-talk see S. Davies 2003). And others raise\nthe equally serious question about whether all events and objects that\nwe describe as art can be distinguished cleanly into single-instance\nand multiple-instance objects or events (Currie 1988; Hazlett 2012),\nlargely on the grounds that any work of art can be repeatable\nand that the alleged distinction turns out to be an artifact of our\ncurrent technological capabilities rather than an enduring feature of\nsome kinds of art.\n\nThat said, many philosophers who have accepted the terms \u201cworks\nof art\u201d or \u201cartworks\u201d have also accepted some\ndistinction between multiple-instance and single-instance works of\nart. Allan Hazlett begins an essay on repeatable artworks, ones that\nhave multiple instances, this way:\n\n\nThere seem to be repeatable artworks. Plays and musical works, like\nShakespeare\u2019s Hamlet or Mussorgsky\u2019s\n\u201cPictures at an Exhibition\u201d, can be performed again and\nagain; installations, like Sol LeWitt\u2019s Wall Drawing\n#260 (1975), can be installed over and over; dishes of food, like\nJean-George Vongerichten\u2019s tuna tartare, can be prepared many\ntimes (Hazlett 2012: 161).\n\n\nIn light of this distinction, determining the kind of entities works\nof art are depends upon explaining and defending one of the following\nproposals: \n\nthe view using C. S. Peirce\u2019s (1906)\n\u201ctype/token\u201d distinction, wherein some works are\nthemselves both tokens and types and others are types that take\nmultiple instances as their tokens; \n the view that all works of art are extended individuals and what\nappear to be mere instances are, in fact, parts of the larger whole work; \n the view that works of art are instances of \u201cnorm\nkinds\u201d, wherein they function as types (or kinds) and\nalso have a normative dimension that enables us to determine if\ninstances of the kind are properly or improperly formed; and \n the view that works of music, dance, and theater are\n\u201cstages\u201d of \u201cperduring\u201d objects and events\n\n\n\n(see \u00a74 of the entry on\n the history of the ontology of art\n and Rohrbach\u2019s article (2012) in the Routledge Encyclopedia\nof Aesthetics, third edition, for in-depth surveys of these\nviews; and also see work by Peirce 1906: 505ff.; Wolterstorff 1980; Predelli\n2001, S. Davies 2003; D. Davies 2004, Thomasson 2005; Dodd 2012; and\nMoruzzi 2018.\n\nOne striking feature of the disputes about these proposals is that\neach of these proposals makes sense of one class of them but has\ndifficulty explaining\u2014or explaining away\u2014certain others of\nthem. This may be due in part to the wide diversity among artistic\nevents and objects. But, whatever the cause, one result is that\n\u201cincreasingly, the very rules of engagements are as much the\ntopic of philosophical dispute as the ontological proposals\nthemselves\u201d (Rohrbaugh 2012).\n\nWhen it comes to narrowing down to the ontology of theater there are\nmore specific questions that make any approach to the ontology of\ntheater more difficult. The first question concerns how we determine\nwhat one must say there is within the discourse of theater. On the\ncommon view outlined above, the most basic ontological question is\n\u201cWhat do we (have to) say there is?\u201d with respect to some\ndomain of discourse (Quine 1948). On the Quinean view one should first\ndetermine what the best empirical theory is in some field of inquiry,\nsecond regiment that theory in terms of some system of formal logic,\nand then, thirdly, ask what objects satisfy the existentially\nquantified variables within that regimented discourse. That will be\nthe ontology of that field of inquiry. But before we can ask what one\nmust say there is with respect to theater, one first must ask what the\ndiscourse is that generates the descriptive facts over which\nthe variables of quantification are supposed to range. That is, to\nwhat discourse is this method for determining the ontology of theater\nto be applied? Any answer we can currently give to this question will\nbe the devastating observation that what exactly the descriptive facts\nare that are discussed in the relevant discourse, and thus what the\nactual discourse is, are themselves questions that are not actually\nsettled.\n\nThe second, and perhaps the more practically pressing of the two more\nspecific questions that must be asked regarding theater, is\n\u201cWhat exactly are instances of theater: performances,\nproductions, or illustrations of dramatic literature?\u201d It is\ncommonly assumed by theater or performance theorists that the correct\nanswer is \u201cperformances\u201d. But this is both far from clear\nand under-argued (see Hamilton 2007: 3\u201316 for a discussion of\nthis point). One way to address this question is to ask a more\nfundamental question about theater, as Paul Woodruff does (2008): what is it to make something\nworth watching? Another is to ask, as David Saltz, James Hamilton,\nNoel Carroll do (2001): what it is that people are interpreting and\nevaluating when they discuss theatrical performances and what is an\ninterpretation? Yet another is to ask, as David Osipovich does\n(2006): what is a theatrical performance actually like in the\nexperience of those who present it and those who attend it at the time\nof the performance itself? And a further is to ask, as W. B. Worthen\n(2007) and Hamilton (2009a) have: what is the relation between\nperformances/productions and texts\u2014i.e., specifically in\nrelation to works of dramatic literature? Once again, \u201cthe rules\nof engagement\u201d, as Rohrbaugh calls them, are as much disputed as\nthe proposals themselves.\n\nNotably, the methods for responding to this question seem to be\nepistemic rather than ontological\u2014that is, they seek to defend\nan answer to the question based on the role each of the possible\nanswers would play in our reasoning about theatrical performances. And\nthey seem to yield no distinctive proposals regarding the ontology of\ntheater. Moreover, to the extent they do yield such proposals, they\noften seem to offer empirical, rather than a priori, evidence\nto support the answer their view entails (Fine 2012). Thus, the\nstandard answers to the second question\u2014which certainly\nappears to be ontological\u2014point in a different\ndirection, namely to epistemic concerns about how we know what it is\nwe know about theatrical performances and less about what we must say\nthere is. And this is despite the fact that, in Carroll\u2019s case\nat least, the answer is derived from a general ontological view,\nnamely, his widely discussed view about the ontology of mass art.\n",
