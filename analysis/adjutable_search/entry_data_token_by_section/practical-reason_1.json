Naturalism and Normativity\n\n The connection of practical reason with intentional action raises\nlarge questions about its credentials as a capacity for genuine\nreasoning.  As noted above, intentional action is not mere bodily\nmovement, but reflects a distinctive attitude of the agent\u2019s,\nviz., intention. To be in this kind of mental state is to have\nsettled on a plan which one seeks to realize through one\u2019s\naction. Intention seems in this respect to be strikingly unlike\nbelief.  Propositional attitudes of the latter sort have a\nrepresentational function; they aim to fit the way the world is, so\nthat if one discovers that the world is not how one previously took it\nto be, one will acknowledge pressure to modify one\u2019s belief in the\nrelevant dimension (pressure to which one will respond if one is not\nirrational). With intentions however things seem crucially different\nin this respect (Smith 1987).  The intention to go shopping on\nWednesday, for instance, is not a state that would or should be\nabandoned upon ascertaining or confirming that one has not (yet) gone\nshopping on Wednesday; rather a person with such an intention will\nordinarily try to bring the world into alignment with the intention,\nby going shopping when Wednesday comes around. Intentions are in this\nway more like an architect\u2019s blueprints than like sketches of an\nalready-completed structure (Anscombe 1957; compare Velleman\n1989).\n\n Reflection on this contrast between belief and intention has led some\nphilosophers to ask whether practical reason might not be something of\na misnomer.  The difficulty, in a nutshell, is to make sense of the\nsuggestion that a genuinely rational process could by itself generate\nstates with the peculiar function of intentions. Reason seems a\ncapacity for cognitive operations, whereas intentions are\ndistinctively noncognitive states, insofar as they do not aim to\nreflect independent facts of the matter about the way things happen to\nbe in the world.\n \n Expressivism represents one line of response to this skeptical worry about\npractical reason. Accounts of this kind offer interpretations of the\nnormative and evaluative language that distinctively figures in\npractical reflection. As was seen in section 1, such reflection\naddresses an agent\u2019s reasons for acting in one way or another;\nconclusions about such reasons are characteristically couched in\nevaluative terms, as claims about what it would be good to do,\nor as normative conclusions about the actions that one ought to\nperform. According to the expressivist, however, evaluative and\nnormative claims of these kinds do not represent genuine cognitive\nachievements, judgments that are literally capable of being true or\nfalse.  Rather they give expression to desires, sentiments, plans, and\nother pro-attitudes, the sorts of goal-directed noncognitive state that move\npeople to action. The expressivist contends that we can make sense of\nthe capacity of practical reason to generate states with the peculiar\nstructure and function of intentions only if evaluative and normative\nassertions are understood along these lines.\n\n Expressivism in this form suggests a naturalistic interpretation of\npractical reason, one that may seem appropriate to the enlightened\ncommitments of the modern scientific world view. It is naturalistic\nmetaphysically, insofar as it makes no commitment to the objective\nexistence in the world of such allegedly questionable entities as\nvalues, norms, or reasons for action. If normative and evaluative\nclaims do not represent genuine cognitive achievements, then their\nlegitimacy does not depend on our postulating a realm of normative or\nevaluative facts to which those claims must be capable of\ncorresponding. It is also naturalistic psychologically, insofar as it\nyields explanations of intentional human behavior that are basically\ncontinuous with explanations of the behavior of non-rational\nanimals. In both the human and the non-human case, behavior is\nunderstood as the causal product of noncognitive attitudes, operating\nin conjunction with a creature\u2019s factual representation of how things\nare in its environment.  The special sophistication of human agency\nmay be traced to the fact that humans have much more sophisticated\nlinguistic methods for giving voice to their motivating noncognitive\nattitudes. Indeed, many contemporary expressivists would contend that\nthese expressive resources are sufficiently powerful that we can\nexplain by means of them the features of practical deliberation that\ninitially give it the appearance of a genuine form of reasoning\n(Blackburn 1998, Gibbard 1990, Gibbard 2003).\n\n Other philosophers remain unimpressed with this naturalistic approach\nto practical reason. One ground for dissatisfaction with it is the\nfollowing.  The expressivist strategy relies on an initial contrast\nbetween practical reflection on the one hand, and the genuine forms of\ncognitive activity characteristic of theoretical reasoning on the\nother. There has to be some important sense in which practical\ndiscourse does not satisfy the standards of rationality that\ndistinguish authentic cognitive discourse in the literal sense;\notherwise the contention that normative discourse is expressive rather\nthan cognitive will lack any significant content.  But the contrast\nbetween theoretical and practical reflection required for this purpose\nseems elusive. As we saw in section 1 above, theoretical reasoning\nappears to be no less a normative enterprise than practical\nreasoning. It is plausibly understood to concern itself with reasons\nfor belief, the evidence and other considerations that speak for and\nagainst particular conclusions about the way things are in the\nworld. To the extent this is the case, theoretical and practical\nreasoning would both seem equally problematic from the naturalistic\nperspective\u2014assuming, that is, that it leaves no place for\nsuch normative considerations as reasons. But if naturalism calls into\nquestion the credentials of theoretical reason, it thereby undermines\nthe contrast between genuine reasoning and noncognitive forms of\nnormative and evaluative discourse on which expressivists themselves\nrely.\n\nA different ground for concern about expressionism has to do with the\ndistinction between normative judgment and intention. Expressivism\nmakes sense of the fact that practical reason is practical in its\nissue by collapsing this distinction altogether. Normative reflection\ncan bring about adjustments in our intentions because it just is a set\nof operations on our intentions (or intention-like practical\nstates). Compliance with what we ordinarily think of as a rational\nrequirement, to bring our intentions into alignment with our normative\nbeliefs, is thus secured through a kind of conceptual fiat. The result\nis that there is no room, on this position, for the paradigmatic form\nof irrationality in practice represented by akrasia, whereby\nagents fail to do what they themselves believe they ought to do.\n Many of those who reject expressivist accounts would endorse some\nvariety of realism about the subject matter of practical reason. The\nbasic commitment of realism in this domain is the idea that there are\nfacts of the matter about what we have reason to do that are prior to\nand independent of our deliberations, to which those deliberations are\nultimately answerable. Realists picture practical reason as a capacity\nfor reflection about an objective body of normative truths regarding\naction (Skorupski 2010, Parfit 2011, Scanlon 2014). An alternative\napproach\u2014different both from realism and from the kind of\nexpressivism sketched above\u2014is constructivism (Korsgaard 1997,\nStreet 2008, Street 2010). This approach denies that practical reason\nis a capacity for reflection about an objective domain of independent\nnormative facts; but it equally rejects the expressivist\u2019s\nnaturalistic suspicion of normativity.  According to the\nconstructivist, practical reason is governed by genuine normative\nconstraints, but what makes these constraints normative is precisely\ntheir relation to the will of the agents whose decisions they govern.\nThe principles of practical reason are constitutive principles of\nrational agency, binding on us insofar as we necessarily commit\nourselves to complying with them in willing anything at all. The realm\nof the normative, on this approach, is not pictured as a body of\ntruths or facts that are prior to and independent of the will; rather,\nit is taken to be \u2018constructed\u2019 by agents through their\nown volitional activity.\n",
