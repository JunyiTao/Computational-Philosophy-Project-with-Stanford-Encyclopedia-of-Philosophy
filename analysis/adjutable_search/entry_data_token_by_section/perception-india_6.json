    "main_text": "Perspectives on Perception || Advaita Ved\u0101nta: direct knowledge\n2.5 Advaita Ved\u0101nta: direct knowledge\n\nAccording to Advaita Ved\u0101nta the defining characteristic of\nperception is the directness of knowledge acquired through perception\n(Bilimoria, 1980:35). In highlighting the directness of the perceptual\nprocess, the Advaitin differs from Ny\u0101ya and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 proponents for whom the contact of the\nsense faculty with its object is central to the perceptual process.\nVed\u0101nta Paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (ed. 1972: 30) cites pleasure\nand pain as instances of perception that are directly intuited without\nany sense object contact. For the Advaitin perception is simply the\nimmediacy of consciousness; knowledge not mediated by any instrument\n(Gupta et. al., 1991, p. 40). It is worth noting that this definition\nis very close to that accepted by Navya-Naiy\u0101yikas. Like the\nlatter, the Advaitins regard the role of the sensory connection as\naccidental, rather than essential, to the perceptual process. The\nNeo-Advaitins accept the distinction between conceptual or determinate\nperception (they refer to it as vi\u1e63ayagata\npratyak\u1e63a) and non-conceptual or indeterminate perception\n(nirvikaplapka pratyak\u1e63a), but do not think of\nnon-conceptual perception as simply a prior stage of conceptualized\nperception, as other Hindu schools do.\n \n\n",
