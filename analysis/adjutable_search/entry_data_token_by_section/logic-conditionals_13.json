Given a Boolean formula \\(A\\) of \\(L_0\\), and\na set \\(W\\) of possible worlds over which they are interpreted, we let\n\\(\\Pr(A)\\) denote \\(\\Pr(\\lvert A\\rvert)\\), namely the probability\nassigned to the worlds in which \\(A\\) is true. For \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) two\nBoolean formulae, the conditional probability\n\\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)\\) is definable by the Ratio Formula:\n\n(Ratio Formula)\n\\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\Pr(A\\wedge\nC)}{\\Pr(A)}\\), provided \\(\\Pr(A)>0\\).\n\n\nNow consider the problem of determining the probability that if a fair\ndie lands even, it will land on six. The probability of the material\nconditional \u201ceither it is not even, or it is a six\u201d is\n\n\\[\\Pr(1\\vee 3\\vee 5\\vee 6)=\\nicefrac{2}{3}.\\]\n\n\nThis clearly exceeds the probability sought, which is instead captured\nin terms of the conditional probability of getting a six assuming it\nis an even number, \n\n\\[\\Pr(6 \\mid 2\\vee 4 \\vee 6)=\\nicefrac{1}{3}.\\]\n\n\nMore generally, the probability \\(\\Pr(A\\supset C)\\) of any material\nconditional is never less than the conditional probability\n\\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)\\), a point apparently first stressed by\nReichenbach (1949, p. 437).\n\nAdams\u2019s central assumption is that for every conditional\nsentence \\(A>C\\) in which \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are Boolean sentences,\nand for every probability function \\(\\Pr\\), the probability of the\nconditional equals the corresponding conditional probability:\n\n(Adams\u2019s Thesis) For every Boolean\nsentences \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and every probability function \\(\\Pr\\),\n\\(\\Pr(A>C)=\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)\\), provided\n\\(\\Pr(A)>0\\).\n\n\nAdams\u2019s Thesis has two sides. From the inner standpoint of\nAdams\u2019 logic of conditionals, it may be viewed as a\ndefinition: the conditional probability defines the degree of\nprobability assigned to a simple conditional. From the outer\nstandpoint of ordinary English, Adams\u2019s Thesis makes an\nempirical claim: namely, that the assertability of a simple\nconditional is a function of the conditional probability of the\nconsequent given the antecedent.\n\nStipulating that \\(\\Pr(A>C)=1\\) when \\(\\Pr(A)=0\\), Adams\ninvestigates several notions of validity for the language \\(L_1\\) of\nflat conditionals. His original definition is the following:\n\n(Probabilistic Validity) An inference is\nprobabilistically valid if and only if, for any positive\n\\(\\varepsilon\\), there exists a positive \\(\\delta\\) such that under\nany probability assignment under which each of the premises has a\nprobability greater than \\(1 - \\delta\\), the conclusion will have a\nprobability of at least \\(1 - \\varepsilon\\).\n\n\nOne way of understanding this definition is by contraposing it: an\nargument is invalid when an arbitrarily high probability can be\nassigned to the premises, but such that the conclusion falls short of\na high probability.\n\nAdams contrasts this definition with an alternative criterion for\nvalidity that is perhaps more intuitive:\n\n(Strict Validity) An inference is strictly\nvalid if and only if its conclusion has probability 1 under any\nprobability assignment under which its premises each have probability\n1.\n\n\nEvery probabilistically valid inference is strictly valid, but not\nvice versa. Strict validity coincides with classical validity. In\nlater work, Adams uses an alternative definition of probabilistic\nvalidity, based on the notion of uncertainty. Given a probability\nfunction \\(\\Pr\\), the uncertainty U\\((A)\\) of a sentence \\(A\\) is\ndefined as \\(1-\\Pr(A)\\):\n\n(p-Validity) An inference is p-valid if\nand only if for every probability assignment, the uncertainty of the\nconclusion is no greater than the sum of the uncertainty of the\npremises.\n\n\nProbabilistic validity and \\(p\\)-validity can be shown to coincide\n(Adams 1975: Thm. 3.1). For Boolean formulae, moreover, Adams shows\nthat the three definitions of validity coincide with classical\nvalidity. For conditional sentences, however, the resulting logic is\nweaker, and corresponds in fact to system P.\n\nAs in the semantics considered in\n sections 3\n and 4, Monotonicity, Transitivity, and Contraposition fail\nin Adams\u2019 semantics. Consider Transitivity: it is easy to\nconstruct models in which \\(\\Pr(B\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)=1\\),\n\\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muB)>1-\\delta\\) for positive, but\narbitrarily small \\(\\delta\\), and yet \\(\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)=0\\)\n(see\n Fig. 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Counterexample against\nTransitivity in an Adams model [An\n extended description of Figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis yields a counterexample according to either definition of\nprobabilistic validity. Similar examples can be constructed for\nMonotonicity, Contraposition, and the paradoxes of the material\nconditional.\n",
