    "main_text": "Practices and Methods || Diversity of Scientific Inquiries\n3.1 Diversity of Scientific Inquiries\n\nWhile it is a truism that scientists employ diverse methods, pluralism\nas a methodological thesis articulates stronger claims about the\ninevitability or epistemic benefits of diverse research methods. In\nhis discussion of the doctrine of the unity of method, Hacking (1996)\ndistinguishes between scientific method understood as logic of\njustification and scientific method understood as methodology, that\nis, as a way of finding out about the world. When attacking\n\n\nthe opinion generally accepted that the various sciences named are\nfundamentally distinct in respect of subject matter, sources of\nknowledge and technique, (Carnap 1931/34 [1995: 32])\n\n\nCarnap was actually solely concerned with issues of justification.\nWhat mattered to him was to establish that everything that can be said\nin science about the world lends itself to the same type of\njustification, hence the unity of the domain of the sciences. His\nmotivation for the reconstruction of all scientific sentences within a\ncommon linguistic framework was to abolish differences in terms of\nepistemic access, especially between the human and the natural\nsciences. As is well known, Carnap\u2019s project was not successful.\nMore generally, not much progress has been made since the heyday of\nlogical positivism when it comes to the elaboration of a complete and\nunified account of empirical justification in science, notwithstanding\nthe much-discussed prospects of the Bayesian approach (Earman 1992:\nx). Some philosophers challenge the very project of a universal\ninductive scheme (Norton 2003) and the debate mainly amounts to\nassessing the cogency of the quest for a unified analysis of inductive\ninferences.\n\nBy contrast, on the methodological side of the notion of scientific\nmethod, pluralist approaches have given rise to a multiplicity of\nconcepts aiming at describing and making sense of the diversity of\nscientific practices. Influenced by \u201cscience and technology\nstudies\u201d, \u201cintegrated history and philosophy of\nscience\u201d, and \u201cphilosophy of science in practice\u201d,\nmany efforts have been made to grasp both the diachronic and\nsynchronic varieties of styles of scientific inquiries, in the vein of\nclassical propositions such as Foucault\u2019s\n\u201c\u00e9pist\u00e9m\u00e9\u201d (1966),\nFleck\u2019s \u201cDenkstil\u201d (\u201cthought\nstyle\u201d) (1935) or Kuhn\u2019s \u201cparadigm\u201d (1962). A\nseminal contribution in this domain is Hacking\u2019s multifaceted\nconcept of \u201cstyles of scientific reasoning\u201d (1982, 1992a,\n2012). Drawing on the work of the historian of science Crombie (1994),\nwho identified six main \u201cstyles of thought\u201d, that is, six\nmain modes of \u201cscientific inquiry, argument and\nexplanation\u201d in the European scientific culture, Hacking\u2019s\nambition is to provide a concept that combines methodological,\nontological and social dimensions in order to account for long-term\naspects of scientific development. Hacking conceives each style as\nbeing both the product of the evolution of human cognitive capacities\nand the result of specific features of human cultural history. A style\nof scientific reasoning is characterized as introducing new kinds of\nobjects, new types of propositions, new types of explanations and is\n\u201cself-authenticating\u201d, that is, it defines its own\nstandard of validity. One line of discussion of Hacking\u2019s\nproposition is whether his concept of style of scientific reasoning is\ntoo inclusive. In light of the above characterizations, it might be\nargued that certain types of reasoning such as religious thinking\nqualify as a style of scientific reasoning. Another line of discussion\naddresses the \u201cfoliated pluralism\u201d (Ruphy 2011b) that\nfollows from the current co-existence of different styles of\nscientific reasoning and specifies its main characteristics in terms\nof transdisciplinarity, synchronicity, nonexclusiveness and\ncumulativeness.\n\nAccounts of different styles of scientific reasoning interact with\nwider debates in philosophy, history, and social studies of science\nthat aim to understand the heterogeneity of scientific practices\nthrough different \u201cscenes of inquiry\u201d (Jardine 2000) and\n\u201cepistemic cultures\u201d (Knorr-Cetina 1999). Rather than\naiming to theorize \u201cthe structure of science\u201d in singular,\nsuch accounts emphasize that scientific inquiry is shaped by its\nembedding and interaction with heterogenous cultures that contribute\nto equally heterogenous practices. However, case study-based\napproaches (Chemla & Keller [eds.] 2017) also highlight that\ndistinctions between scientific cultures require a dynamic picture\nthat acknowledges shared concepts and constant interactions with both\nother scientific cultures and external factors.\n\nEmpirical accounts of the existing plurality of scientific cultures\ncan be complemented with normative arguments in favor of heterogenous\nforms of inquiry. Such a normative case for pluralism has been most\nfamously articulated in Feyerabend\u2019s (1975) plea for anarchism\nin science and finds more recent expressions in what Chang (2012)\ncalls \u201cactive normative epistemic pluralism\u201d. This\npluralism takes an active normative stance in the sense of advocating\nfor the cultivation of multiple systems of practice in the same field\nof study to reap benefits of toleration (different practices producing\ndifferent valuable results) and benefits of interaction (interactions\nof practices jointly produce valuable results).\n",
