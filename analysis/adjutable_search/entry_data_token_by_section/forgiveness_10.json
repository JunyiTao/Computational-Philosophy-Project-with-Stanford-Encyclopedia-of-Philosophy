The Oxford English\nDictionary includes \u201cpardon\u201d in its definition of\n\u2018forgive\u2019, and Hobbes drew a connection between forgiving\nand the facility to pardon in his sixth Law of Nature: \u201cA sixth\nlaw of Nature is this, \u2018that, upon caution of the future time, a\nman ought to pardon the offences past of them that, repenting, desire\nit\u2019\u201d ([1651] 1969). Remarking on this law, Bernard Gert\nwrites, \u201cThis virtue, which Hobbes calls having the facility to\npardon, one can also call being forgiving\u201d (2010: 98). In a\nsimilar vein, Leo Zaibert has recently argued that \u201cforgiveness\nis deliberately to refuse to punish\u201d (2009: 368). According to\nthe psychologist Robert Enright and his colleagues, forgiveness\ninvolves \u201cthe casting off of deserved punishments\u201d\n(Enright et al. 1992: 88). On these punishment-forbearance\nviews of forgiveness, forgiving crucially implicates the forbearance\nof punishment. \n\nAccording to these views, when one forgives one commits not to hold a\npast wrong against someone and (so the story goes) were one to punish,\ndoing so would be to hold a past wrong against the wrongdoer.\nPunishment-forbearance accounts may come in a variety of flavors,\ndepending on how one understands the logical relations between\nforgiving and forbearing punishment (see, e.g., Londey 1986:\n4\u20135; Wolsterstorff 2009: 203; Bash 2015: 53; Russell 2016). One\ncould hold that forbearing punishing is necessary for forgiveness, or\nsufficient, or both. Alternatively, one could make a\nnormative claim about the relations between forgiveness and\npunishment: forgiving a wrongdoing makes future punishment for that\nwrong morally inappropriate (see, e.g., Swinburne 1989: 97).\n\nSome reject these claims about the relationship between the\nforbearance of punishment, instead finding \u201cno clash between\npunishment and forgiveness\u201d (Mabbott 1939: 158; cf. Haber 1991,\nMurphy 2003: 101; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1967). For further discussion of\nthe relationship between punishment and forgiveness see Griswold\n(2007: 32\u201333), Pettigrove (2012: 117\u2013121), Russell (2016),\nTosi and Warmke (2017); and Warmke (2011, 2013).\n",
