    "main_text": "What is Moral Status? || Criteria for Moral Status\n2.2 Criteria for Moral Status\n\nThe central question in the debate over the full moral status of human\nbeings with radical cognitive disabilities concerns the type of\nattributes on which moral status is based. Most of those who deny or\nquestion the full moral status of all human beings insist that moral\nstatus must be based exclusively on attributes or properties of the\nindividual; those attributes must be identifiable by a biological or\npsychological inventory of that individual, with no reference to the\nbiological or social environment it inhabits. For example, it would be\npossible to assess an individual\u2019s self-consciousness or\npractical rationality knowing nothing about its fellow creatures\n(although the assessment itself might have to be done by\nself-conscious and practically rational creatures). In contrast, we\ncould not ascertain an individual\u2019s species membership or social\nrelationships without knowing a great deal about the world it\ninhabited. We will call accounts based solely on individual attributes\n\u201cindividually-based\u201d; we will label\n\u201cgroup-based\u201d those accounts based on facts about the\nindividual\u2019s membership in a biological or social group, or her\nrelationship with other members of that group. Those facts may concern\nthe individual\u2019s biological origins, the typical or average\ncharacteristics of a biological or social group to which she belongs,\nor her actual relationships with other individuals. Although some\nindividually-based accounts concern an individual\u2019s capacity or\npotential to form relationships of certain kinds with other\nindividuals, it is that capacity or potential which confers moral\nstatus, not the existence of such relationships.\n\nThose who insist that moral status must be based on an\nindividual\u2019s own attributes, that it cannot depend on the\naccidents of birth or the vagaries of biological classification, are\nalso likely to insist that an individual\u2019s claims on others\ncannot depend on whether those others happen to be members of the same\nspecies or communities. In this view, full moral status must not only\nbe independent of external circumstances, but must be universally\nrecognized. Although some group-based accounts may require that a\nbeing\u2019s full moral status be universally recognized, others see\nfull moral status as group-relative (see\n Sec. 5.1).\n\nIn comparing accounts of moral status, it is important to note two\npossible differences between such accounts. First, they may propose\ndifferent conditions as sufficient for full moral status. Some\naccounts, for example, claim that membership in the human species is\nsufficient for that status. Second, they may offer different\nexplanations of how the satisfaction of those conditions grounds or\nwarrants full moral status. For example, even if being a Homo sapiens\nsuffices for possessing full moral status, there may be different\nrationales for why it is sufficient: 1) because it is in the\nnature of Homo sapiens to be rational; 2) because the\nrational nature of the species requires respect for all of its\nmembers, rational or not; or 3) because members of the same species\nhave a duty of partiality to each other, regardless of their\nindividual attributes. Thus, the two accounts ground moral status in\nthe same relational property\u2014membership in the human\nspecies\u2014and they make membership a sufficient condition for full\nmoral status. But they use the fact of species membership differently\nin justifying moral status. They might also associate different rights\nwith full moral status, in accordance with their different ways of\ngrounding it. And, as discussed in\n Sec. 4,\n they may have different implications about who is required to\nrecognize or respect an individual\u2019s status.\n",
