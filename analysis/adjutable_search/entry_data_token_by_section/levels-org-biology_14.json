This synthesis often results in conceptually guided and\nempirically driven theory. Explicitly attending to different levels\nand the distinct scale-relative dynamics supports hypothesis and\ntheory building by making intelligible the scale-bound practices of\nobservation and motivating manipulation of well-defined targets in\nmanifestly complex systems.\n\nInstances of such synthesis are widely available in contemporary and\ntwentieth century biological science. For example, conceptualizing\ncancer as primarily a tissue-level disease (albeit with multiple\nlevels playing roles) has long been closely connected to interpreting\nand reinterpreting laboratory findings based on a leveled conceptual\nlandscape. Already in the 1930s, organicist biologists were\nhypothesizing that cancer be understood as deviations in tissue\ncompetence that disrupt maintenance of healthy tissue, enabling\nuncontrolled growth (Waddington 1935; Needham 1936a; see also\nAbercrombie, Heaysman, & Karthauser 1957; Sonnenschein & Soto\n1998). More recent conceptually guided work on cancer has reiterated\nthis insight, with many postulating that cancerous growth comprises a\nreversal from the multicellular state to the unicellular state,\namounting essentially to a dissolution of a tissue by disrupting\ntissue-level forces (Chen et al. 2015; see also Trigos et al. 2018).\nThis transition from multicellular to unicellular directly mirrors the\nexperimentally induced emergence of multicellular individuals\ndescribed in the previous section, a pattern noted by the authors\nabove in the case of the snowflake yeast clusters (Ratcliff, Denison,\net al. 2012).\n\nAnother example of synthetic theory involving levels more generally\nconcerns the dynamics of collective behaviors in tissue. Busby and\nSteventon (2021) argue that \u201ctissue tectonics\u201d, that is,\ntissue-level mechanical forces and associated timing, provide a\nmechanism for coordinating morphogenetic events across multiple levels\nof organization (see also Xi et al. 2019; Zinner, Lukonin, &\nLiberali, 2020). One striking example of tissue tectonics concerns the\nsliding of tissue sheets containing populations of cells within the\nrespective sheets, which allows intercellular signaling to occur\nbetween these populations, thus enabling a crucial timing event to\ninduce changes in cell states. One key feature of such examples is the\npreponderance of claims that causality free moves between levels via\nconcrete interactions, both in \u201cupward\u201d and\n\u201cdownward\u201d fashions (Busby & Steventon 2021; Zinner,\nLukonin, & Liberali 2020; see also\n section 5).\n",
