But there have been attempts to restore some\nversion of the theory. Often, but not always, these efforts sought to\nsustain mental sense data as the immediate objects of perception. The\nmost extensive efforts are by Frank Jackson, in Perception\n(1977), and Howard Robinson, in a book of the same title (1994).\n\nJackson set out to support the conclusion that the immediate objects\nof perception are mental and that they represent physical objects. He\nfirst argues that what we immediately perceive are sense data, which\nare colored patches. His argument appeals to the fact that when we\nperceive an object, we are not in immediate contact with the whole\nobject but only a portion of it, and that we are immediately aware of\nthe color and shape of this portion. We see the object in virtue of\nseeing its surface, and the basic form of seeing its surface is to see\nits color and shape via sense data that represent that surface. The\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d relation does all the work here; Jackson\ndoes not draw on, and rejects, the arguments from Variation and\nIllusion (1977: chs. 1, 4, 7).\n\nThis conclusion does not say whether sense data are mental or physical\n(1977: 119). The argument that sense data are all mental proceeds for\nthe case of vision by seeking to establish that colors are mental\nitems. The argument is indirect, from the conclusion that colors are\nnot physical. This conclusion, in turn, relies on the claim that color\nis not a \u201cscientific property\u201d, that only scientific\nproperties exist in the external world and affect the eyes and brain,\nand that color then can only be a mental entity caused by neural\nactivity (1977: ch. 5).\n\nThe argument relies on a conception of scientific or physical\nproperties that is widespread in philosophy: that physics has no place\nfor phenomenal properties or perceptual experience. Accordingly,\nphysics posits particles and forces, which may cause perceptual\nexperience in a suitable perceiver, but which themselves are\ncolorless. Jackson is certainly right that physics today does not\naccept something akin to phenomenal color as a fundamental physical\nproperty; rather, it accepts wavelengths and brain processes, and\nthese possess no such fundamental property. Prior to the evolution of\ncolor-sentient beings, there presumably were no phenomenal experiences\nof color, hence none to be counted among physical phenomena.\nNonetheless, physics, especially in the science of optics, accepts the\n\u201csubjective perception of color\u201d (Nelson 2017:\n125) as an object of\n study,[22]\n just as acoustics accepts the experience of pitch as a physical\nphenomenon (Weld & Palmer 1925: 322). Arguably, phenomenal\nexperiences need not be reduced or even reducible to basic physical\nprocesses in order to be counted among physical phenomena and hence\namong items to be investigated in the hard sciences, including\nphysics. Accordingly, color experience needn\u2019t be decisively\ncategorized as \u201cnon-physical\u201d. Its ultimate ontology is\nleft open. It might be a mental content as in an intentional theory or\nother appearance\n theory.[23]\n The color property might be analyzed relationally, as a surface\nproperty with the power to produce a color experience, which\nneedn\u2019t be a colored sense datum. The metaphysical status of\nphenomenal experience need not be decided in order for the conditions\nof such experience to be examined in the science of physics.\n\nRobinson (1994) sets forth the most extensive case for sense data in\nrecent times. His book offers a history of sense-data theory, which he\nsees as deriving from Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Robinson thus\ndisagrees with the history offered above as regards Berkeley and\nLocke. He also specifies a standard conception of sense data (1994:\n1\u20132): that such data possess the sensible qualiteis they appear\nto have, and that they are not intrinscally representational (they do\nnot intrinsically refer beyond themselves; they have no intentional\ncontent). He takes the Argument from Illusion to be the primary\nclassical argument for sense data in the twentieth century (though not\nmuch invoked before). Most of the other arguments he examines are\nrelated to Variation or Illusion, or to Jackson\u2019s argument from\nscience about color.\n\nSome of Robinson\u2019s arguments are new to our discussion, such as\nthe Time-Lag Argument. It notes that the light reaching our eyes from\nstars may be hundreds or thousands of years old and so the star may\nhave ceased to exist. On the assumption that the object of veridical\nperception exists, our perception cannot be of the actual star, and\nhence must be of another object. But all perception involves a causal\nprocess that unfolds in time; hence, on the assumption that perception\nmust be simultaneous with its object, we never perceive the actual\nproperties of the things that reflect or emit light (1994: ch. 3).\nThis argument can be extended to a Causal Argument (1994: ch. 6) which\nappeals to the fact that we can be made to seem to perceive objects by\nnon-standard causal processes, such as those that underlie\nhallucination. In such cases, we don\u2019t perceive an external\nobject and so there must be another object that we perceive, having\nthe properties that appear to us (invoking\n item 3 of the Classical Notion).\n These cases could be phenomenally indistinguishable from normal\nperception. Hence, arguing that phenomenally indistinguishable items\nshould be classified as the same type of object (as in Price\u2019s\nArgument from Illusion, Sec. 2.2.3, above), we should conclude that in\nthe normal case we also don\u2019t directly perceive an external\nobject.\n\nIn addition to making these various arguments for sense data, Robinson\n(1994: ch. 7) also raises objections against what he takes to be the\nprimary opponents: intentionalism and the adverbial theory. He further\nsuggests that, if his arguments for sense data are sound, this finding\nwould support a phenomenalistic idealism over physical realism (1994:\nchs. 8\u20139). (On idealism, see Guyer & Horstmann 2015 [2021];\non realism, Miller 2002 [2019].)\n\nFor those who would avoid both mental and non-mental perceptual\nintermediaries, the theory of \u201cNaturalized Sense Data\u201d\n(NSD) is of interest (Berm\u00fadez 2000). It distinguishes between\nwhat is directly perceived and what is immediately perceived. In this\nscheme, three-dimensional objects are directly perceived but not\nimmediately perceived. We immediately perceive the portion of the\nsurface of the object that is visible at any moment. Because we\nimmediately perceive a portion of the three-dimensional object, we are\nable to make ostensive reference to the three-dimensional object\nitself and so, it is claimed, to perceive it directly. NSD assumes\nthat na\u00efve realism holds that we immediately perceive\nthree-dimensional objects as a whole; NSD therefore rejects na\u00efve\nrealism, since according to NSD we immediately perceive only\nsurface-portions (2000: 369\u2013372). NSD objects to traditional\nsense-data theory as placing an unnecessary intermediary between the\nperceiver and ostended objects (2000: 370\u2013371).\n\nThere are two problems with this position. First, as Berm\u00fadez\nobserves, if it is to avoid bringing in mentalistic factors, it\nrequires a physicalist account of color as a surface property, which\nhas not been forthcoming (2000: 368, n. 14; 373). Second, if a\nphysical surface-portion provides the immediate object of perception,\nthen it provides the phenomenal content of our perception. When Moore\nendorsed surface-portions as immediate objects, he noted the problem\nthat if a surface of a round penny (seen obliquely) is the object of\nperception, it should appear round. Since he held that it did not, he\nfelt compelled to say that the sense datum appears elliptical but is\nround, thereby sundering the immediacy by bringing a separate\n\u201cappearance\u201d into the mix. A defender of NSD might counter\nMoore\u2019s response by saying that the penny in fact looks round\nand slanted, so there is no disparity between physical surface-portion\nand phenomenal perception. But then Price\u2019s objection arises.\nPrice allowed for what is now called full shape constancy within a few\nfeet of the observer: the round penny at a slant would appear round.\nBut he noted that, beyond a few feet, constancy starts to break\n down.[24]\n This creates a problem for NSD: within the framework set out here, it\nwould need to recognize \u201cappearances\u201d with content that\ndiffers from the actual structure of a surface-portion. This violates\nthe intent of NSD, which is to establish an account in which the\nphenomenal content of perceptual experience is provided by the\nproperties of the surface-portion itself, without needing to invoke\nappearances in addition to immediately perceived surface-portions.\n",
