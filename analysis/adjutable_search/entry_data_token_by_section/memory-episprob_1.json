    "main_text": "The Nature of Memory || Human Memory\n1.1 Human Memory\n\nHuman memory is not one but several things or systems (Michaelian\n2011c). The systems play different roles, most of which we might call\n\u201cremembering\u201d, even though the remembering may vary\nnotably from one system to the next. Some memory systems also help us\nimagine possibilities or think about the future, however. As the entry\non\n memory\n already taxonomizes human memory systems in detail, this entry will\nnot. It will, however, briefly overview some of them. Psychologists\nand philosophers often distinguish declarative from non-declarative\nmemory, which may roughly differentiate memory for accessible\ninformation from memory for everything else. Declarative memory\nincludes episodic and semantic memory (Tulving 1972). How best to\ndivide episodic and semantic memory turns out to be delicate and\ncontroversial. But they at least superficially differ in many ways,\nincluding in their characteristic content. To simplify: the content of\nsemantic memory is propositional, while the content of episodic memory\nis (a representation of) an event from the rememberer\u2019s past.\nYour friend might remember that a strange event took place\nrecently, because you told her so. But despite your telling, she is in\nno position to remember the event. Here, she is the\nrememberer, and the event was in your personal past, not hers.\n\nThe epistemology of memory has focused on declarative memory, perhaps\nto no one\u2019s surprise. Epistemology is the philosophical study of\nknowledge and of what makes believing reasonable. The epistemology of\nmemory examines memory\u2019s role in this. Epistemology covers most\noften the kinds of knowledge and reasonable believing that pertain to\naccessible information. Declarative memory seems more relevant here\nthan non-declarative. Moreover, since epistemology covers most often\nthe kinds of knowledge and reasonable believing that have\npropositional content, semantic memory seems more relevant here than\nepisodic. The line from remembering that p to knowing that\np makes fewer corkscrews than the line from remembering some\nevent concerning p to knowing that p. Consequently,\nsemantic memory has dominated the epistemology of memory. But in the\nlast few decades, episodic memory has stolen the show in the broader\nphilosophy of memory. It\u2019s safe to bet that a renaissance in the\nepistemology of episodic memory is not far off.\n\nRecent, empirically-minded epistemology of memory has been sensitive\nto a key feature that at least some of our memory systems seem to\nbear: they are constructive. It is most clearly the case that episodic\nmemory in particular is constructive (for the case laid out for a\ngeneral audience, see Schacter 1996, 2001). Remembering events is not\nthe straightforward affair we might have supposed. We might have\nsupposed that memory functions like an archive for the records of what\nwe have experienced; to learn is to deposit into the archive, to\nremember is to withdraw an unchanged deposit, and to forget is for the\narchive to malfunction. The prevailing view now, however, is that\nmemory is constructive, and not just occasionally but normally\n(Michaelian 2011b, 2016). Remembering is not (simply) reproducing a\nrecord, but generating new content.\n\nThis may seem to suggest that memory\u2019s role in our knowing and\nreasonably believing is more limited than we\u2019d thought. New\ncontent from memory is suspicious\u2014likely inaccurate or\nunsupported\u2014particularly if memory is supposed to\nfunction like an archive. But the evidence to support this suspicion\nis wanting (Michaelian 2011b, 2016). Episodic memory is generative,\nbut not in general at the cost of truth. Puddifoot and Bortolotti\n(2019) argue, for instance, that the cognitive mechanisms responsible\nfor certain false memory beliefs are indeed \u201cepistemically\ninnocent\u201d , as they overall increase a subject\u2019s chances\nof having other true beliefs or knowledge (see also Bortolotti and\nSullivan-Bissett 2018). Episodic memory\u2019s epistemic credentials\nare not clearly comprised.\n Section 2.4\n below further explores the significance of memory construction in\nepistemology.\n",
