Production Possibilities in Ramsey\u2019s Formulation\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s goal was practical: \u201cHow much of a nation\u2019s output should\nit save for the future?\u201d The demographic profile over time was taken by\nhim to be given, meaning that future numbers of people were seen as\nexogenous and predictable. We were therefore to imagine that economic\npolicies have a negligible effect on reproductive behaviour (but see\nDasgupta, 1969, for a study of the joint population/saving problem,\nusing Classical Utilitarianism as the guiding principle). Parfit (1984)\nchristened choices involving the same demographic profile, \u201cSame\nNumbers Choices.\u201d\n\n\nThe ingredients of Ramsey\u2019s theory are individuals\u2019 lifetime\nwell-beings. Government House in his world maximizes the expected sum\nof the lifetime well-beings of all who are here today and all who will\never be born, subject to resource constraints. The optimum distribution\nof lifetime well-beings across generations is derived from that\nmaximization exercise. Of course, the passage of time is not the same\nas the advance of generations. An individual\u2019s lifetime well-being is\nan aggregate of the flow of well-being she experiences, while\nintergenerational well-being is an aggregate of the lifetime\nwell-beings of all who appear on the scene. It is doubtful that the two\naggregates should have the same functional form. On the other hand,\nthere is little evidence to suggest that we would be way off the mark\nin assuming they do have the same form. As a matter of practical\nethics, it helps enormously to approximate by not distinguishing the\nfunctional form of someone\u2019s well-being over time from that of\nwell-being across the generations. Ramsey adopted this short-cut.\nPeople were also taken to be identical, so we may as well assume that\nthere is a single individual at each date. The move removes any\ndistinction between time and generations. An alternative interpretation\nwould have us imagine that the economy consists of a single dynasty,\nwhere parents in each generation leave bequests for their children\n(Meade 1966, adopted this interpretation). Ramsey also assumed,\nprobably because the mathematics is simpler, that time is a continuous\nvariable, not discrete.\n\n\nLet \\(t \\ge 0\\) denote time. In Ramsey\u2019s model there is no\nuncertainty (but see Levhari and Srinivasan, 1969, for one of the first\nof many extensions of the Ramsey model that incorporate uncertainty\nabout future possibilities). The economy is endowed with a single,\nnon-depreciating commodity that can be worked by labour to produce\noutput at each date (Gale 1967 and Brock 1973, were among the first\nof many extensions of the Ramsey model that contain a heterogeneous\ncollection of capital goods). The economy is assumed to be closed to\ninternational trade (opening the economy to trade involves only a minor\nextension to Ramsey\u2019s model). That means some of the output can be\ninvested so as to add to the commodity\u2019s stock while the remainder can\nbe consumed immediately. We call the stock of the commodity that serves\nto produce output, \u201ccapital.\u201d The problem is then to find the optimum\nallocation of output at each date between consumption and\ninvestment.\n\n\nRamsey assumed that work is unpleasant. But because including the\ndisutility of work in our account of his work here would add nothing of\nsubstance, we suppose that labour supply is an exogenously given\nconstant (e.g., it is independent of the wages labour can demand). That\nenables us to suppress the supply of labour in both production and the\nfactors affecting well-being.\n\n\nIf \\(K\\) is the stock of capital of the economy\u2019s one and only\ncommodity, output is taken to be \\(F(K)\\), where \\(F(0) = 0\\) (i.e.,\noutput is zero if there is no capital), \\(dF(K)/dK \\gt 0\\) (i.e.,\nthe marginal product of capital is positive), and \\(d^2 F(K)/dK^2\n\\le 0\\) (i.e., the marginal product of \\(K\\) does not increase with\n\\(K\\)). \\(F(K)\\) is a flow (production at a moment in time), in\ncontrast to \\(K\\), which is a stock (quantity of capital,\nperiod). Notice also that output depends solely on the stock of\ncapital. No mention is made of possible improvements in the quality of\ncapital or labour. Thus, there is no prospect of technological\nprogress or accumulation of human capital in Ramsey\u2019s model (but\nsee Mirrlees 1967, for one of the first of many extensions of the\nRamsey model that include technological advances in production and\nhuman capital formation); nor are there any natural resources in the\nmodel (but see Dasgupta and Heal 1974, for one of the first of many\nextensions of the Ramsey model that include natural capital in\nproduction).\n\n\nLet \\(C(t)\\) be consumption at \\(t\\). It is a\nflow (units of consumption per moment). Similarly, we write\n\\(K(t)\\) for the stock of capital at \\(t\\). As\n\\(dK(t)/dt\\) is the rate of change in the\ncapital stock at \\(t\\), it is \u201cnet investment at \\(t\\),\u201d\nwhich too is a flow. And because the capital stock is assumed not to\ndepreciate, gross investment equals net investment.\n\n\nIn Ramsey\u2019s model anticipated output at each moment equals the sum\nof intended investment and intended consumption. Intentions are always\nrealized. To put it in technical language, the economy is in\nequilibrium at each moment, which is another way of saying that at each\nmoment intended saving equals intended investment. (The assumption\nneeds no explanation in a model with a single agent, but has real bite\nin a world where savers are not the same agents as investors.) Capital\nis assumed to be always fully deployed, and labour (which is hidden in\nthe production function \\(F(K)\\)) is taken to be fully\nemployed. Output at \\(t\\) is \\(F(K(t))\\).\nIt follows that the economy is driven by the dynamical equation\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\frac{dK(t)}{dt} = F(K(t)) - C(t)\n\\]\n\n\nEquation (1) says that if consumption is \\(C(t)\\), investment is what\nremains of output. So, Ramsey\u2019s problem can be cast equally as,\n\u201cHow much of a nation\u2019s output should it consume?\u201d\nIf consumption is less than output at \\(t\\) (i.e., \\(C(t) \\lt\nF(K(t))\\), investment is positive (i.e., \\(dK(t)/dt \\gt 0)\\) and the\nstock of capital increases; but if consumption exceeds output at\n\\(t\\), investment is negative, which means capital is eaten into and\nthe stock declines (i.e., \\(dK(t)/dt \\lt 0).\\) We now imagine that\nGovernment House is advised by a \u201csocially-concerned\ncitizen,\u201d the person being someone who is trying to determine\nthe right balance between the economy\u2019s consumption and\ninvestment at each date. We shall call that person the decision\nmaker, or DM. Ramsey imagined that DM is a\nClassical-Utilitarian.\n",
