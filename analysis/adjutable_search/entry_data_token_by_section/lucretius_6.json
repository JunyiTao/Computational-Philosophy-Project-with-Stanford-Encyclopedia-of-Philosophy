Religion\n\nLucretius opens the DRN with a traditional prayer to\nanthropomorphic Venus, as a world-governing deity (1.21), to support\nhis poetic project and to pacify her lover Mars (1.21\u201340). This\nis already problematic, but the opening sequence is made even more\npuzzling by the immediate sequel, a clear statement of the most\nimportant Epicurean departure from popular belief about the gods, the\ndenial that they intervene in the world, because that is incompatible\nwith their eternal happiness, 1.44\u20139:\n\nFor the nature of divinity must necessarily enjoy immortal life along\nwith the greatest peace, far removed and separated from our affairs;\nfor without any pain, without any danger, itself mighty by its own\nresources, needing us in nothing, it is neither moved by benefactions\nnor touched by anger. (transl. Rouse-Smith with modifications)\n\n\nThe passage is fully orthodox (Key doctrines 1, Letter to\nMenoceus 123) and the same lines recur later at 2.644\u201351,\nafter the Magna Mater passage, where they make much better\nsense as a correction, from an Epicurean standpoint, of the preceding\nallegorical treatment of the earth as mother of the gods. But the\nbrutally abrupt way the lines undercut the prayer to Venus is\ndifficult. Many editors have suggested that 1.44\u20139 are an\nintrusion and should be removed or at most reflect an incomplete draft\n(defense in Bailey 1947 vol. II pp. 601\u20134; survey in Butterfield\n2020). But regardless of whether we keep or reject 1.44\u20139, it\nseems likely that Lucretius meant us, later on and from hindsight, to\nreinterpret the opening scene in some way more compatible with\nEpicureanism.\n\nLucretius next describes the intellectual hero, whose \u2018flight of\nthe mind\u2019 liberated humanity through science (61\u201379;\nEpicurus, again in hindsight, though not named), followed by the\nexample of human sacrifice of Iphigeneia (80\u2013101), to condemn\nwrong religion. (The example is quite literary: human sacrifice\nwas not a feature of Roman religion.) The main focus thereafter is\nnatural science, the atomic world free from divine governance, and\nLucretius does not return to the gods themselves until book 5. At\n5.146\u201355 we learn that the gods have exceedingly fine bodies, so\nthat they cannot be seen or touched, only grasped by the mind (that\nis, via especially fine simulacra, see below). Accordingly,\nthey do not dwell in the world. Lucretius\u2019 promise to tell us\nwhere they dwell (5.155) is never fulfilled, but other Epicurean\nsources hold that the gods dwell in the inter-cosmic voids. In\nLucretius this much seems strongly implied by the imagery used at\n3.14\u201330, when the world falls away as we experience\ndivine pleasure.\n\nThe origins of human belief in gods are given later in book 5 as part\nof the history of civilisation (1161\u20131240). Early men, both with\nwaking mind and in their dreams, had visions of the gods as beings of\ngreat beauty, stature and strength. As these figures did not seem to\nage, they attributed to them eternal life (1169\u201382). It was then\nthat, unable to puzzle out the workings of the heaven, they\n\u2018took shelter\u2019 by, as it were, handing over the governance\nof the world to these gods. That, for Lucretius, was the great fall.\nAt 1204\u20131240 Lucretius offers some impressive lines on\nnature\u2019s capacity, still now, to cow and grind down humanity, as\nwhen we contemplate the majesty of the heavens or are shaken up by the\nthunder and lightning of a powerful storm.\n\nLucretius\u2019 fullest positive account of the Epicurean gods and of\nhuman piety is given in the proem of book 6 at 68\u201378:\n\nUnless you spew all these errors out of your mind, and put far from\nyou thoughts unworthy of the gods and alien to their peace, their holy\ndivinity, impaired by you, will often do you harm, not that the\nsupreme power of the gods is open to insult, so that it should in\nwrath thirst to inflict sharp vengeance, but because you yourself will\nimagine that they who are quiet in their placid peace, are rolling\ngreat billows of wrath, you will not be able to approach their shrines\nwith placid heart, you will not have the strength to receive with\ntranquil peace of spirit the images (simulacra) that are\ncarried to men\u2019s minds from their holy bodies, declaring what\nthe divine shapes are. (transl. Rouse-Smith)\n\n\nIn the Letter to Menoeceus 123 Epicurus enjoins us to\n\u2018think of a god as an indestructible animal\u2019 and\nexplains that to form a proper conception of the divine, we must\nreject all that is incompatible with that core notion (as above\n1.44\u20139). What this book 6 passage adds is an explanation of how\nwe must make ourselves receptive to the gods, so that their images may\nimpinge upon our minds. The result is that it is we who are in\nlarge part responsible for shaping our conception of the gods. Peace\nof mind, while mostly an Epicurean end in itself, in this case also\nbecomes instrumental to the formation of a proper conception of the\ngods.\n\nStill, there are problems. Since our access to the gods proceeds\nexclusively through simulacra, and it is all too easy to form\na wrong conception of the gods, one can worry how any certain\nconception about them is possible (why no multiple explanations\nhere?), or why we should think that these gods are anything above and\nbeyond those simulacra, or again if it actually matters that\nthere should be such beings, since they do not answer prayers or\npunish wrongdoing. Add to that the numerous difficulties and awkward\nquestions that must be overcome to support the extra-cosmic life of\nsuch anthropomorphic gods with quasi-bodies and quasi-blood (see\nCicero On the nature of the gods 1.43\u20139), and one can\nsee how Epicurus\u2019 ancient critics felt free to accuse him of\natheism, the extra-cosmic gods merely providing plausible denial. An\necho of that tension is still heard in the modern scholarly debate\nabout these gods, confronting realists, who hold that Epicurus really\nwas committed to the existence of these gods (Konstan 2011) and\nidealists, who hold that we are mostly responsible for constructing\nour own conception of an ideal life (Long and Sedley 1987 section 23;\nSedley 2011). Perhaps the only relative certainty is that Lucretius,\nwho above distinguishes the gods from their simulacra, is\nofficially a realist, as is Philodemus (Essler 2011).\n\nYet however that theoretical debate comes out, it makes little\ndifference at the practical level, where the exemplarity of the gods\nis far more important. By focusing our minds upon the perfect life we\nconceive these gods to live, we can find or construct models on how\nbest to live out our own finite span. Such exemplarity in turn appears\nto be the best way to understand the various claims made by the\nEpicureans, followed by Lucretius, that Epicurus himself was a\nparadoxical \u2018mortal god\u2019 (deus ille fuit\n5.8) who taught his followers how to lead \u2018a life worthy of the\ngods\u2019 (3.322) that is, a life lived as far as possible in\nimitation of the blessed and imperturbable gods (Erler 2002). The\nexemplary life Epicurus led \u2013 and often in other Epicurean\nliterature his immediate disciples as well \u2013 could function as a\nsuitable model for such \u2018focusings\u2019 of the mind.\n\nOne last aspect of Lucretius\u2019 deification of Epicurus that\nappears to go beyond his status as model is his depiction as the\ngreatest benefactor of humanity in the proem of Book 5. This, however,\nmay owe more to the popularity of Euhemerism at Rome in the first\ncentury B.C. than anything Epicurean. Euhemerus (active c. 300 BCE)\nproposed that the gods of myth had originally been men, who had been\ngranted immortality in recognition of their discoveries or gifts to\nmankind, and whose names recorded their accomplishment, for example\n\u2018Bacchus\u2019 for wine. This rationalistic work had an\nunderstandable vogue in the Hellenistic period, where divinization of\nkings was not infrequent, and had been translated into Latin by\nEnnius. Lucretius claims that Epicurus\u2019 benefactions surpass the\ndiscoveries of agriculture, wine, and even the heroic deeds of\nHeracles, so that he should count as the greatest benefactor of\nmankind. Whereas these benefactors only improved mankind materially,\nEpicurus purged our hearts from troubles and desires (5.49\u201351).\nThe passage is in good part a rhetorical exercise in which Lucretius\nshows that he can beat the Euhemerists at their own game, while also\nsubtly undermining them, since Epicurus hardly strove after\nimmortality, as shown by the past tense fuit (Gale 1994\nappendix 1). More obviously the sequence serves the literary function\nof introducing the main topic of the last third of the book, the\ngrowth of civilisation. But unlike the discoverers celebrated and\nimmortalised by Euhemerus, Lucretius\u2019 discoverers in\n5.1011\u20131457 are all anonymous.\n",
