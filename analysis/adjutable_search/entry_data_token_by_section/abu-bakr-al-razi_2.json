Ethics\n\nFrom the foregoing discussion of al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s theodicy it\nmay seem obvious that his ethical teaching would focus on the goal of\nliberation from the body and its concerns. But as mentioned already,\nhis Philosophical Way of Life defends a lifestyle of\nmoderation, and distances itself from outright asceticism.\nFurthermore, in this text he says that bodily pleasure may licitly be\nsought so long as one does not transgress what he calls a \u201climit\npast which one may not go\u201d. This limit dictates that we should\npartake of no pleasures\n\n\nthat can be attained only by engaging in evildoing, murder, and in\ngeneral anything that displeases God, when the judgment of intellect\nand justice is that it is unnecessary. All else is permitted.\n(al-R\u0101z\u012b, RF: 106\u20137)\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the Spiritual Medicine he seems to take\na dim view of pleasures, and offers advice for resisting the allure of\nfood, drink, sex, and luxury. One point made in both works is that it\nis a violation of reason to enjoy things that entail more pain than\npleasure in the long run, like overeating. In the Spiritual\nMedicine al-R\u0101z\u012b tells the story of how he chastized a\nman who gobbled down a plate of dates, warning him that it would lead\nto illnesses, and thus \u201cmany times more pain than the pleasure\nyou have had\u201d (al-R\u0101z\u012b, RF: 71).\n\nTwo interpretations have been offered to explain\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s position on pleasure. According to Lenn E.\nGoodman (1971, 1999, followed by Groff 2014), al-R\u0101z\u012b was\ndefending an Epicurean ethic in which pleasure should be maximized. On\nthis account, his rationale for moderation is that it is the way to\nhave the most pleasure: going too far with pleasures turns out to be\nmore painful in the long run. This interpretation has been criticized\nby Adamson (2008a, 2021), on the grounds that it ignores\nal-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s own theory of pleasure. According to this\ntheory, which is clearly based on the Timaeus, pleasure can\nbe had only as the result of a process of removing a harmful state.\nFor example, drinking is pleasant because it eliminates thirst. On\nthis account of pleasure, as Plato himself pointed out, hedonism is an\nattempt to win at a zero-sum game: you can only have pleasure to the\nextent that you have suffered pain, or at least harm. (Not all harm is\nfelt as pain, just as not all restoration is felt as pleasure, because\nonly fast changes are noticeable.) Furthermore, al-R\u0101z\u012b says\nhimself in the Doubts about Galen (DG: \u00a77.7) that\npleasure is not the good to be sought in itself, which is a\ndirect rejection of the sort of hedonism adopted in Epicureanism.\n\nOn this latter reading, much of al-R\u0101z\u012b\u2019s advice for\nreaders focuses on helping non-philosophers work towards a moderate\nlifestyle, which will prepare them for the more serious and important\nundertaking of adopting a \u201cphilosophical way of life\u201d that\nwill ultimately lead to liberation from the body. Al-R\u0101z\u012b\nhimself seems to accept this distinction between\n\u201cpre-philosophical\u201d and \u201cphilosophical\u201d ethics\n(Druart 1997, Adamson 2016), for example in the aforementioned passage\nabout the glutton who loves dates. Al-R\u0101z\u012b says he\nthreatened the man with stomach aches and illness because\n\n\nthis and other such remarks are of more benefit to someone who has not\nengaged in philosophical training than proofs built on philosophical\nprinciples.\n\n\nAs for the truly philosophical life, it resides in the Platonic ideal\nof imitating God (Theaetetus 176b), realized through the\npursuit of wisdom and justice towards all living things. In a\nremarkable passage of the Philosophical Way of Life,\nal-R\u0101z\u012b stresses the importance of not mistreating beasts of\nburden and other non-rational animals (Adamson 2012). This would\nexplain the \u201cupper limit\u201d placed on the pursuit of\njustice: that limit does not derive from the need to maximize pleasure\nand minimize pain, but from the injunction to avoid \u201cdispleasing\nGod\u201d by engaging in injustice.\n\nIn more recent publications this interpretive dispute seems to be\nmoving towards agreement. Goodman (2015) now concedes that\nal-R\u0101z\u012b, unlike Epicurus, does not make pleasure the highest\ngood and sole criterion in ethics. He does however adopt a therapeutic\napproach to ethics, which is characteristic of Epicureanism, as of\ncourse is the advice to avoid things that bring pain than pleasure all\nthings considered. Adamson accepts this (2021: 6), but suggests that\nthe resonances with Epicureanism may rather reflect a more general\nreception of Hellenistic ethics by al-R\u0101z\u012b, again through\nthe intermediary of Galen (see also Bar-Asher 1989).\n",
