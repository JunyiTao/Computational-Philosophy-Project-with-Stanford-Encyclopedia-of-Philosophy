    "main_text": "Politics || Liberty and ridicule\n5.2 Liberty and ridicule\n\nAn overriding feature of Shaftesbury\u2019s political thinking is the\nimportance of \u201cLiberty in general\u201d\n(C 3.314). In a letter, he said that \u201cthe Triumph of\nLiberty\u201d is \u201cthe hinge and Bottom of all three [volumes of\nCharacteristicks] and of the whole Work it self\u201d (see\nKlein 1994: 124). He opposes absolutism and tyranny in all forms,\narguing vociferously for free public discourse and toleration of\ndifferent religious practices. He tries to show that control by church\nand court is not necessary\u2014is in fact counterproductive\u2014to\nthe virtue, sociability, and politeness of citizens (see Klein 1994:\n124\u2013135 and 195\u20137; Den Uyl 1998: 310; Carey 2006: 126). On\nKlein and M\u00fcller\u2019s readings (discussed above), proper\nattention to Shaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty and to the\nweakening of the control of church and court reveals that\nCharacteristicks is fundamentally a pro-Whig, anti-Tory tract\n(Klein 1994: 125; M\u00fcller 2013 and 2014a).\n\nDen Uyl argues that Shaftesbury does not think the state can or should\nactively promote virtue (Den Uyl 1998: 310\u2013315). Schneewind\nmakes a similar point when he writes, \u201cThe virtuous agent is not\ncreated by the political structure he inhabits. He brings his\ncharacter to it\u201d (Schneewind 1998: 309; see also 295\u20138,\n307\u20139). The best political course, consequently, is for the\nstate to allow as much liberty as possible, because that is most\nlikely to give individuals their own opportunity to fashion morally\nbeautiful characters. Political liberty creates the conditions for\nvirtue, even if politics cannot promote virtue itself. (For possibly\ncountervailing evidence see C 2.36\u20137, where Shaftesbury might be\nsuggesting that proper civic laws can promote virtue).\n\nM\u00fcller argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s commitment to liberty is\ngrounded in his fundamental moral position that virtue consists not\nmerely of performing certain actions but of acting from the right\nmotives (M\u00fcller 2012 and 2013; see C 2.12\u201315, 32, 38). A\nperson who benefits others only because she thinks she will be\nrewarded if she does so, and will be punished if she does not, does\nnot possess virtue. Her beneficence is virtuous only if it is\nmotivated by concern for others, not by selfish considerations\nexternal to others\u2019 welfare. Thus, even if the authorities of\nchurch and court can institute rewards and punishments that may induce\ncertain kinds of behavior, they will have done nothing to promote\nvirtue.\n\nShaftesbury believes that a free exchange of ideas will produce the\nsame benefits for the intellectual world that a\n\u201cFree-Port\u201d produces for commerce, and he\nmaintains that\n\n\nWit will mend upon our hands and Humour will refine\nit-self; if we take care not to tamper with it, and bring it under\nConstraint. (C 1.64)\n\n\nShaftesbury contends as well that the more liberty there is in a\nsociety, the greater its advancements will be in politeness,\nunderstanding, and the arts. \u201cAll Politeness is owing to\nLiberty,\u201d he writes.\n\n\nWe polish one another, and rub off our Corners and rough Sides by a\nsort of amicable Collision. To restrain this, is inevitably\nto bring a Rust upon Mens Understandings. \u2019Tis a destroying of\nCivility, Good Breeding and even Charity it-self, under pretence of\nmaintaining it. (C 1.64\u20135)\n\n\nAbout the arts he writes,\n\n\n\u2019Tis easy \u2026 to apprehend the Advantages of our Britain\n[over states with less liberty] and what\neffect its establish\u2019d Liberty will produce in every thing which\nrelates to Art. (C 1.219)\n\nJustness of Thought and Style, Refinement in Manners, good Breeding,\nand Politeness of every kind, can come only from the Trial and\nExperience of what is best. Let but the Search go freely on, and the\nright Measure of every thing will soon be found. (C 1.10)\n\n\nOn this basis Den Uyl attributes to Shaftesbury a belief in the\nefficacy of a \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d to \u201cpromote\ntruth and the reformation of character\u201d (Den Uyl 1998: 314; see\nalso Darwall 1995: 186).\n\nOne of the most conspicuous elements of Shaftesbury\u2019s belief in\nthe benefits of free speech and other forms of liberty is his\n\u201cTest of Ridicule\u201d (C 1.11). He argues that the\nstate should allow the people to engage in public ridicule because it\nwill ultimately expose the problems in faulty views and leave\nunscathed the strengths of reasonable views. As Lund (2012) and Amir\n(2016) point out, Shaftesbury never says explicitly that ridicule is\nthe test of truth, but he makes statements that are very similar to\nthat. He writes, \u201cI am sure the only way to save Mens Sense, or\npreserve Wit at all in the World, is to give Liberty to Wit\u201d (C\n1.19). Also: \u201cTruth \u2026 may bear all Lights\u201d\n(C 1.61) and \u201cNothing is ridiculous except what is\ndeform\u2019d\u201d (C 1.128). Ridicule will reveal the\nridiculousness of things that really are ridiculous, but no lasting\n\u201cRidicule can lie against Reason\u201d (C 1.11). Reasonable\npositions will always be able \u201cto endure a Ridicule wrongly\nplac\u2019d\u201d because while people may be \u201cfrighted out of\ntheir wits\u201d, they will never \u201cbe laugh\u2019d out of\n\u2018em\u201d (C 1.96). True ideas will not be harmed by ridicule,\nwhile false ideas will. One of Shaftesbury\u2019s prime examples of\ntruth and reasonableness being able to withstand ridicule is Socrates,\ntoward whom ridicule was directed but to whom ridicule did not stick\n(C 1.32). His prime example of ridicule undermining what really is\nridiculous is the use of humor and wit to mock fanatical religious\nviews. Indeed, ridicule is the very best way to deal with unhinged\nreligious fanatics. For while governmental restriction on those\nenraptured by \u201csuperstition and enthusiasm\u201d is likely only\nto inflame their ardor, witty ridicule (such as puppet shows) will\nwork to deprive such views of the opposition they need to thrive,\ninevitably leading to their withering in the face of the reasonable\nand sober (C 1.18).\n\nAmir (2016) argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s optimism about\nridicule\u2019s capacity to undermine falsity and only falsity is\nbased on his metaphysical view that what is true is harmonious.\nAccording to Amir, without the belief that everything that is true is\nharmonious, and that all deformity fails to capture truths of\nGod\u2019s creation, Shaftesbury\u2019s optimism about the test of\nridicule will appear unmotivated and naive.\n\nShaftesbury does not, however, propose unlimited free speech. While he\nis in favor of a good-humored ridicule, he also thinks there is a\nvicious kind of ridicule that does not serve the purposes of\ntruth\u2014although it is not always clear what principled\ndistinction he draws between on the one hand \u201cgenteelest\nWit\u201d and \u201ctrue Raillery,\u201d and on the other\n\u201cscurrilous Buffoonery\u201d and \u201cMalignity hid under\nHumanity\u201d (C 1.63, 1.65; Klein 1995, 138). The former works as a\ntest of truth, but the latter does not. The latter may thus be subject\nto legal penalty: \u201cIf men are vicious, petulant, or abusive; the\nMagistrate may correct them\u201d (C 1.10). This raises the question\nof whether Shaftesbury can produce an account of the right kind of\nridicule. He seems to believe that the right kind of ridicule is\nmotivated by a genuine and good-humored concern for truth and public\ngood, while the wrong kind is not. But it is far from clear that this\nwill give us a principled method for determining which speech should\nbe allowed and which should not.\n\nCarroll (2018) shows that Shaftesbury supported various restrictions\non speech and publication throughout his political career. He might\nhave been opposed to pre-publication censorship, but he was not\nopposed to post-publication penalties that would serve as a deterrent.\nAs a result, Carroll maintains, we should not take Shaftesbury\u2019s\ndefense of speech to be an argument for a completely open public\nsphere. (See also M\u00fcller 2013 and Chavez 2008.)\n\nEven for speech he takes to be a legitimate contribution to worthwhile\ndiscourse it is not clear how expansive a realm of freedom Shaftesbury\nhas in mind. Sometimes he suggests that completely free discussion is\nappropriate only within a club for elites, and not amid the\nhurly-burly of the hoi polloi. As he writes in Wit and\nHumour,\n\n\nFor you are to remember (my Friend!) that I am writing to you in\ndefence only of the Liberty of the Club, and of that sort of\nFreedom which is taken amongst Gentlemen and\nFriends, who know one another perfectly well. And that\n\u2019tis natural for me to defend Liberty with this restriction, you\nmay infer from the very Notion I have of Liberty it-self. (C 1.75)\n\n\n(For discussion of Shaftesbury\u2019s view of the \u201cclub\u201d\nand the public, see Carey 2006: 128 and Chaves 2008: 54.)\n",
