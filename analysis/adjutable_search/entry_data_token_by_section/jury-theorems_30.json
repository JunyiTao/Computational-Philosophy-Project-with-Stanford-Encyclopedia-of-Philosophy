Like\ndemocratic theory, social choice theory has a procedural and an\nepistemic branch. Procedural social choice theorists want procedures\nto be intrinsically \u201cdemocratic\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d to\nindividuals; they formulate axiomatic requirements on procedures\ncapturing normative principles (such as anonymity or Paretianism) and\nask which procedure(s) satisfy\n them.[36]\n Epistemic social choice theorists instead want procedures to\n\u201ctrack the truth\u201d; they formulate some epistemic criterion\non outcomes (e.g., high probability of correctness) and analyse\nprocedures in terms of how well their outcomes satisfy the\ncriterion.\n\nJury theorems fall into the epistemic camp. What distinguishes them\nwithin epistemic social choice is the focus on decision-body size\nrather than more conventional procedural parameters, such as the\nacceptance threshold in a supermajority rule or the individual weights\nin a weighted voting rule. Jury theorems seek to optimize group size\ngiven a procedure (e.g., given majority rule), rather than\noptimizing the procedure given a group size. Procedure\noptimisation is sometimes possible analytically. The generic finding\nis that, under a classical independence assumption, the epistemically\noptimal procedure in binary choices is a weighted (simple, super- or\nsub-) majority rule in which a voter\u2019s weight is a well-defined\nincreasing function of competence (which becomes negative for\ncompetence below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)); see, e.g., Nitzan and Paroush\n(1982), Ben-Yashar and Nitzan (1997), Dietrich (2006), and Pivato\n(2013). Simple majority rule can be far from optimal; in suitable\ncircumstances, it is optimal if voters are equally competent\nand options are initially equally likely correct.\n",
