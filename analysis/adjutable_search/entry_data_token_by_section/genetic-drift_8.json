    "main_text": "Detecting Drift Empirically || Classic Studies\n4.1 Classic Studies\n\nThe disagreements over the prevalence of drift and selection began\nalmost immediately after Wright and Fisher incorporated drift into\ntheir evolutionary models (see Provine 1986 for an extended discussion\nof their disagreements, to which this discussion is very much\nindebted). Wright (1931a, 1932), drawing on his experience with animal\nbreeding, developed the Shifting Balance Theory (SBT), which consisted\nof three phases; these have been understood either as empirical claims\nabout actual conditions (Provine 1986) or descriptions of the ideal\nconditions for evolution (Skipper 2002). Skipper provides a clear\ndescription of the SBT as Wright would eventually formulate it (see\nHodge 2011 for discussion of early formulations):\n\n\nIn the first phase, random genetic drift causes gene frequencies to\nchange and pull subpopulations semi-isolated within the global\npopulation into adaptive valleys because random fluctuations in gene\nfrequencies are almost always maladaptive. In phase two, mass\nselection will then act within subpopulations and increase their\nfitness, dragging them from adaptive valleys to adaptive peaks. In the\nthird phase, selection between subpopulations, which Wright called\ninterdemic selection, driven by differential dispersion (migration of\norganisms from more fit subpopulations to less fit subpopulations)\nwould then enable the global population to be raised to its optimal\npeak. (Skipper 2002: 345)\n\n\nDrift, then, on Wright\u2019s view, plays an essential role in the\nevolutionary process. Fisher, by contrast, thought that mass selection\non large populations was the predominant and most effective mode of\nevolution, leaving very little role for drift given the large\npopulation sizes. (This disagreement about the relative role of drift\nin evolution is one of several things that Wright and Fisher disagreed\nabout; e.g., as is clear from the above, they also disagreed about\npopulation structure and effective population size. See Skipper 2002,\n2009 and Plutynski 2005 for analyses of contemporary biologists who\ncontinue to argue the Wright-Fisher debate).\n\nAnother, related issue arose concerning the character of the traits\nthat were said to be subject to random drift. Wright\u2019s early\nwritings, in particular, emphasized the nonadaptive character of the\ntraits undergoing drift and produced by drift (as can be see in\nSkipper\u2019s characterization of Wright\u2019s SBT above). But a\nnumber of potential confusions arise here (Provine 1986; Millstein\n2009): First, \u201cnonadaptive\u201d does not necessary mean\n\u201cmaladaptive\u201d; it can also mean \u201cneutral\u201d.\nSecond, \u201cnonadaptive\u201d can refer either to the lack of\nadaptive differences between organisms or species, or it can refer to\nthe lack of adaptation to the environment (but authors are not always\nclear about which meaning is intended). So, one\u2019s views on the\nprevalence of drift can be\u2014and historically often have\nbeen\u2014tied to one\u2019s beliefs about the prevalence of\nadaptive traits (in either sense) in populations. Strictly speaking,\nhowever, there is no necessary connection between nonadaptive traits\nand drift; there can be indiscriminate sampling on organisms that are\nadapted to their environment and which differ in fitness, and the\noutcomes of that indiscriminate sampling can pull the population in an\nadaptive direction or a nonadaptive one. Thus, the proper\ncontrast between selection and drift does not map onto\n\u201cadaptive\u201d and \u201cnonadaptive\u201d, but rather to\n\u201cadaptive\u201d and \u201cpossibly nonadaptive\u201d (but\nalso \u201cpossibly adaptive\u201d).\n\nThese theoretical considerations were soon followed by field\nexaminations of drift (there were also laboratory studies, but these\nwere less contentious). Two sets of studies of natural populations are\nparticularly notable. One set, referred to in the introduction to this\nessay, is composed of the studies of the polymorphic land snail,\nCepaea nemoralis; these studies, and debates over the\nprevalence of drift, began in the 1930s and became quite heated in\n\u201cThe Great Snail Debate\u201d of the 1950s and 1960s (Millstein\n2008, 2009 gives more extensive discussion, from which the following\nis drawn; the moniker \u201cThe Great Snail Debate\u201d is due to\nProvine 1986). Early researchers, most famously Arthur J. Cain and\nPhilip M. Sheppard (1950, 1954), sought to demonstrate the adaptedness\nof the color and banding morphs of the snails as well as the sizes of\nthe populations in which they lived. But these were challenging to\ndetermine; adaptedness was primarily studied indirectly, by seeking\ncorrelations between variants and their backgrounds (presuming\ncamouflage and selection by predator), and population sizes varied\nconsiderably. And any correlations found were statistical ones, with\nlots of \u201cnoise\u201d. This left the door open for drift; Maxime\nLamotte (1959) argued that by examining the populations as a whole,\none found greater variation among the small populations than among the\nlarge. This was a distinctive signature for drift, but such outcomes\nare hard to find and require a very special set of circumstances to\nobtain (large numbers of populations of varying sizes that are easy to\ncount). However, Lamotte\u2019s study is not the only classic\nevolutionary study to exploit this unique drift outcome;\nCavalli-Sforza\u2019s studies of blood groups in humans did so as\nwell (Richardson 2006). Notably, this was not drift as an\nalternative to selection (Cain and Sheppard had suggested\nthat selection precluded much of a role for drift), but rather, an\nargument for a substantial role for drift in addition to a\nsubstantial role for selection.\n\nAnother important set of studies is of the polymorphic Scarlet Tiger\nMoth, Panaxia dominula (see Provine 1986 for extended\ndiscussion, to which the following is indebted). Fisher and Ford\ndeliberately chose P. dominula because of its small\npopulation sizes, figuring that if they could make the case for\nselection against drift in its worst case, they could make a decisive\ncase against Wright, who they saw as advocating a form of nonadaptive\nevolution. But rather than trying to make a case for\nselection, as Cain and Sheppard did, Fisher and Ford (1947) tried to\nmake a case against drift by arguing that the fluctuations of\ngene frequencies across generations were too large to be accounted for\nby drift and that the size of the fluctuations did not differ between\nthe small and the large populations, as you would expect if they were\nundergoing drift. Therefore, they concluded, the populations were\nundergoing selection. Wright\u2019s (1948) reply challenged both the\nlogic of this conclusion (disproving drift does not prove selection)\nas well as their characterization of his views, but more\nsignificantly, he pointed out that Fisher and Ford had not included\ndata on population sizes for the years in which the gene frequency\nfluctuations were statistically significant, so, in fact, it was\npossible that the populations had been undergone constrictions in\nthose years, in which case drift would have been able to\nproduce the observed fluctuations. He also pointed out that\nfluctuations in selection or migration (which he very problematically\nsuggested could be part of an expanded understanding of drift) could\nhave produced the same outcomes.\n\nIn short, the P. dominula studies turned on a slightly\ndifferent but related proposed unique outcome for drift, that of\nfluctuations over time rather than variation at a time as for C.\nnemoralis, in both cases comparing small populations to large (as\nwell as considering the capability of populations to produce large\nfluctuations), but with P. dominula, drawing definitive\nconclusions ran into difficulty from lack of data concerning the key\nvariable of population size. There is also the recognition that\nfluctuating selection can produce the same outcome of fluctuations of\ngene frequencies across generations as drift can, making it difficult\nto resolve the empirical case. Finally, note that biologists have\ncontinued to study both C. nemoralis and P.\ndominula, with the result that additional processes have been\nidentified that further complicate the empirical analyses (Millstein\n2008; Skipper 2009).\n",
