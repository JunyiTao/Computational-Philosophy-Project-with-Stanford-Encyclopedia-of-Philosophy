    "main_text": "Key Ethical Issues in Internet Research || Cloud Computing and Research Ethics\n4.4 Cloud Computing and Research Ethics\n\nRecent developments in cloud computing platforms have led to unique\nopportunities\u2014and ethical challenges\u2014for researchers.\nCloud computing describes the deployment of computing resources via\nthe Internet, providing on-demand, flexible, and scalable computing\nfrom remote locations. Examples include web-based email and\ncalendaring services provided by Google or Yahoo, online productivity\nplatforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365, online file\nstorage and sharing platforms like Dropbox or Box.net, and large-scale\napplication development and data processing platforms such as Google\nApps, Facebook Developers Platform, and Amazon Web Services.\n\nAlongside businesses and consumers, researchers have begun utilizing\ncloud computing platforms and services to assist in various tasks,\nincluding subject recruitment, data collection and storage,\nlarge-scale data processing, as well as communication and\ncollaboration (Allan 2011\n [OIR];\n X. Chen et al. 2010\n [OIR]);\n Simmhan et al. 2008; Simmhan et al. 2009).\n\nAs reliance on cloud computing increases among researchers, so do the\nethical implications. Among the greatest concerns is ensuring data\nprivacy and security with cloud-based services. For researchers\nsharing datasets online for collaborative processing and analysis,\nsteps must be taken to ensure only authorized personnel have access to\nthe online data that might contain PII, but also that suitable\nencryption is used for data transfer and storage, and that the cloud\nservice provider maintains sufficient security to prevent breaches.\nFurther, once research data is uploaded to a third-party cloud\nprovider, attention must be paid to the terms of service for the\ncontracted provider to determine what level of access to the data, if\nany, might be allowed to advertisers, law enforcement, or other\nexternal agents.\n\nAlongside the privacy and security concerns, researchers also have an\nethical duty of data stewardship which is further complicated when\nresearch data is placed in the cloud for storage or processing. Cloud\nproviders might utilize data centers spread across the globe, meaning\nresearch data might be located outside the United States, and its\nlegal jurisdictions. Terms of service might grant cloud providers a\nlicense to access and use research data for purposes not initially\nintended or approved of by the subjects involved. Stewardship may\nrequire the prompt and complete destruction of research data, a\nmeasure complicated if a cloud provider has distributed and backed-up\nthe data across multiple locations.\n\nA more unique application of cloud computing for research involves the\ncrowdsourcing of data analysis and processing functions, that is,\nleveraging the thousands of users of various online products and\nservices to complete research related tasks remotely. Examples include\nusing a distributed network of video game players to assist in solving\nprotein folding problems (Markoff 2010), and leveraging Amazon\u2019s\nMechanical Turk crowdsourcing marketplace platform to assist with\nlarge scale data processing and coding functions that cannot be\nautomated (Conley & Tosti-Kharas 2014; J. Chen et al. 2011). Using\ncloud-based platforms can raise various critical ethical and\nmethodological issues.\n\nFirst, new concerns over data privacy and security emerge when\nresearch tasks are widely distributed across a global network of\nusers. Researchers must take great care in ensuring research data\ncontaining personal or sensitive information isn\u2019t accessible by\noutsourced labor, or that none of the users providing crowdsourced\nlabor are able to aggregate and store their own copy of the research\ndataset. Second, crowdsourcing presents ethical concerns over trust\nand validity of the research process itself. Rather than a local team\nof research assistants usually under a principal investigator\u2019s\nsupervision and control, crowdsourcing tends to be distributed beyond\nthe direct management or control of the researcher, providing less\nopportunity to ensure sufficient training for the required tasks.\nThus, researchers will need to create additional means of verifying\ndata results to confirm tasks are completed properly and\ncorrectly.\n\nTwo additional ethical concerns with crowdsourcing involve labor\nmanagement and authorship. Mechanical Turk users were not originally\nintended to be research subjects, first and foremost. However,\nresearchers using Mechanical Turks must ensure that the laborers on\nthe other end of the cloud-based relationship are not being exploited,\nthat they are legally eligible to be working for hire, and that the\nincentives provided are real, meaningful, and appropriate (Scholz\n2008; Williams 2010\n [OIR).\n\nFinally, at the end of a successful research project utilizing\ncrowdsourcing, a researcher may be confronted with the ethical\nchallenge of how to properly acknowledge the contributions made by\n(typically anonymous) laborers. Ethical research requires the fair and\naccurate description of authorship. Disciplines vary as to how to\nreport relative contributions made by collaborators and research\nassistants, and this dilemma increases when crowdsourcing is used to\nassist with the research project.\n",
