    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Theory Reconstruction and Inductive Logic\n1.6 Theory Reconstruction and Inductive Logic\n\nFrom this period, then, Carnap once again focused on scientific\ntheories, and on theoretical languages as not fully reducible to\nempirical observation sentences. While he had given up the effort to\nreduce theories to observations, he remained preoccupied with\nthe complementary problems of how a theory can be confirmed\nby observations, and how the empirical content of a theory\ncan be determined. Both of these problems were articulated, and seen\nas interrelated, in \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d, but\nthereafter they took separate paths. The first of these problems was\ncentral to Carnap\u2019s preoccupation with inductive logic from\nabout 1942, though he was never able to develop it to the point where\nit could be applied to the confirmation of theoretical\nsentences (as opposed to mere empirical generalizations). The second\nproblem was the focus of significant attention to the nature of\ntheoretical languages and the degree to which theories are constrained\nby evidence, as well as the problem how to identify the analytic and\nsynthetic parts of a theoretical hypothesis or a theory, i.e., to\ndistinguish what components of it come with the language framework in\nwhich it is expressed, and what components contain actual information\nabout the world. See sections\n 8.1\n and\n 8.3\n below on Carnap\u2019s further pursuit of both problems and his\ncontroversies and interactions with Popper, Hempel, and others on\nthese issues. The supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 3 and 4)\n deals in more detail with Carnap\u2019s distinction between\nobservation language and theoretical language in science, and with\nCarnap\u2019s reconstruction of scientific theories and theoretical\nterms by means of Ramsey sentences and related logical resources.\n\nHis own primary attention during the later years of his career was to\ninductive logic, where he began by distinguishing two fundamentally\ndifferent explicanda of the concept \u201cprobability\u201d: (i) the\nidea of probability as relative frequency of some occurrence\nin a series of events or in a population, which he regarded as a\nlegitimate and entirely empirical matter. He contrasted it with (ii)\nprobability understood as an epistemic measure of our\ncertainty or uncertainty about the empirical truth or adequacy of a\nstatement. The latter was Carnap\u2019s focus; at the outset he\nworked out a structural and logical conception of epistemic\nprobability, influenced by Waismann and Keynes, as further explained\nin the supplement\n Inductive Logic,\n and progressed over the years toward a more \u201cpersonalist\u201d\nview, though never giving up the logical conception entirely. He\nworked closely with various students and associates on these problems,\nespecially Richard Jeffrey, Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, and John Kemeny. See\n section 8.2\n below, see the supplement\n Inductive Logic\n for the details of his structural account of probability, and see the\nsupplement\n Methodology (Section 1)\n for his probabilistic explication(s) of inductive confirmation. Ray\nJ. Solomonoff\u2019s work on universal inductive inference was also\ntriggered by Carnap\u2019s inductive logic. (Solomonoff studied with\nCarnap in Chicago. See Sterkenburg 2018 for a discussion and\nevaluation.)\n",
