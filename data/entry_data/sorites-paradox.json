    "preamble": "\n\nThe sorites paradox originated in an ancient puzzle that appears to be\ngenerated by vague terms, viz., terms with unclear\n(\u201cblurred\u201d or \u201cfuzzy\u201d) boundaries of\napplication. \u2018Bald\u2019, \u2018heap\u2019,\n\u2018tall\u2019, \u2018old\u2019, and \u2018blue\u2019 are\nprime examples of vague terms: no clear line divides people who are\nbald from people who are not, or blue objects from green (hence not\nblue), or old people from middle-aged (hence not old). Because the\npredicate \u2018heap\u2019 has unclear boundaries, it seems that no\nsingle grain of wheat can make the difference between a number of\ngrains that does, and a number that does not, make a heap. Therefore,\nsince one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it follows that two\ngrains do not; and if two do not, then three do not; and so on. This\nreasoning leads to the absurd conclusion that no number of grains of\nwheat make a heap. \n\nThe same form of reasoning is familiar in everyday life. Dorothy\nEdgington observes:\n\n\nThere\u2019s the \u2018ma\u00f1ana paradox\u2019: the unwelcome\ntask which needs to be done, but it\u2019s always a matter of\nindifference whether it\u2019s done today or tomorrow; the\ndieter\u2019s paradox: I don\u2019t care at all about the difference\nto my weight one chocolate will make. (1997: 296)\n\n\nThe puzzle can be expressed as an argument most simply using modus\nponens: \n\n\n1 grain of wheat does not make a heap.\nIf 1 grain doesn\u2019t make a heap, then 2 grains\ndon\u2019t.\nIf 2 grains don\u2019t make a heap, then 3 grains\ndon\u2019t.\n\u2026\nIf 999,999 grains don\u2019t make a heap, then 1 million grains\ndon\u2019t.\n\nTherefore,\n1 million grains don\u2019t make a heap.\n\n\n\nThe argument is a paradox because apparently impeccable reasoning from\napparently impeccable premises yields a falsehood. The argument can be\nrun equally in the opposite direction, from the premise that one\nmillion grains make a heap: if one million grains make a heap, then\none million less one grain make a heap; and if one million less one\ngrain make a heap, then one million less two grains make a heap; etc.\nIt follows, absurdly, that even a single grain makes a heap. Thus\nsoritical reasoning appears to show both that no number of grains make\na heap and that any number of grains make a heap.\n\nWhat conclusion should we draw from this untoward result? Is there\nsomething wrong with the paradoxical argument, or does the use of\nvague predicates really lead to\n absurdity?[1]\n In part because we use these ordinary words successfully all the\ntime, and do not normally land in absurdities like the ones above,\nmost theorists of vagueness suppose that the paradox is solvable,\ni.e., that the paradoxical argument is defective and we can discover\nthe defect. In what follows we consider some of the principal attempts\nto solve it.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Sorites in History\n\nThe Megarian philosopher Eubulides (4th century BC) is\nusually credited with the first formulation of the puzzle. (The name\n\u2018sorites\u2019 derives from the Greek word soros,\nmeaning \u2018heap\u2019.) Although we don\u2019t know his\nmotivations for introducing it (along with several other legendary\npuzzles), the paradox was later used by Greek philosophers as a\ndialectical weapon, most notably by the Sceptics against the Stoics\u2019\nclaims to knowledge.\n\nCuriously, the paradox attracted little subsequent interest until the\nlate 19th century. Marxist philosophers in the neo-Hegelian\ntradition, like Plekhanov (1908 [1937: 114]), cited the paradox as\nevidence of the failure of \u201ccustomary\u201d logic and the\nutility of the \u2018logic of contradiction\u2019. In this way some\nMarxists sought to establish the triumph of the dialectic. Meanwhile,\nin Anglo-American philosophy, formal logic regained its central place,\nand its classical formalisation left no room for the vagueness of\nnatural language. Vagueness and the associated paradox were seen as\nlying beyond the scope of logic and so posing no challenge to it.\nHowever, since the demise of the ideal language doctrines of the\nlatter half of the twentieth century (see\n \u00a73.1),\n interest in the idiosyncrasies of natural language, including its\nvagueness, has greatly increased. \n2. Different Formulations of the Paradox\n\nAt least three conditions must be met for an argument to be an\ninstance of the sorites paradox. (1) It must be possible to construct\na sorites series for the predicate in question, viz., a\nfinitely-membered ordering of values on a dimension decisive of the\npredicate\u2019s application. A sorites series for \u2018tall\u2019\nis an ordering on the dimension of height (an ordering of heights),\nfor \u2018old\u2019 an ordering on the dimension of age (an ordering\nof ages), and so forth. (2) Neighboring values in the series must be\nonly incrementally different, i.e., either indiscriminable or just\nslightly different. An incremental difference is supposed to guarantee\nthat if a vague predicate applies to one of a pair of neighbors, it\napplies equally to the other. (Following Wright [e.g., 1975], the\nproperty of applying across incremental differences on a decisive\ndimension is often called the tolerance of a vague term.) (3)\nThe predicate must be true of the first value in the series and false\nof the last.\n\nThe paradox is often presented in the conditional form discussed\nabove. More formally: let \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 be a soritical\npredicate and let \u2018\\(\\alpha_{n}\\)\u2019 (where n is a\nnatural number) represent a value in a sorites series for\n\u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019. Then the paradox can be represented most\nsimply this way, using Modus Ponens:\n\nConditional Sorites  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Phi\\alpha_{1}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{1} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{2}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{2} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{3}\\\\\n&\\textrm{Etc.}\\\\\n&\\textrm{If } \\Phi\\alpha_{n-1} \\textrm{ then } \\Phi\\alpha_{n}\\\\\\hline\n&\\Phi\\alpha_{n} \\textrm{ (where \\(n\\) can be arbitrarily large)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nA different formulation of the paradox replaces the set of conditional\npremises with a universal generalization and proceeds by mathematical\ninduction. Let \u2018n\u2019 be a variable ranging over the\nnatural numbers and let \u2018\\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\)\u2019\nassert that every number n satisfies the condition\n...n.... Further, let us represent the claim \u2018For any\n\\(n\\), if \\(\\alpha_n\\) is \\(\\Phi\\) then \\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) is\n\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 as \u2018\\(\\forall n (\\Phi\\alpha_n \\rightarrow\n\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\)\u2019. \n\nMathematical Induction Sorites \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\Phi\\alpha_1 \\\\\n&\\forall n (\\Phi\\alpha_n \\rightarrow \\Phi\\alpha_{n+1}) \\\\\\hline\n&\\forall n(\\Phi \\alpha_n)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nFor example, since a man with 1 hair on his head is bald, and since,\nfor any number of hairs n, if a man with n hairs is bald\nthen so is a man with n+1 hairs, every number n is such\nthat a man with n hairs on his head is bald.\n\nAnother version of the puzzle is a variant of the inductive form. We\nknow that a sorites series for \u2018bald\u2019 contains some\nnumbers of hairs such that men having those numbers of hairs are not\nbald. By the least number principle (equivalent to the principle of\nmathematical induction) there must be a least number, say i+1,\nsuch that a man with i+1 hairs on his head is not bald. Since a\nman with 1 hair on his head is bald, it follows that i+1 must\nbe greater than 1. Hence the series contains a number of hairs\nn (=i) such that a man with n hairs is bald\nwhilst a man with n+1 hairs is not. Let \u2018\\(\\exists\nn(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\)\u2019 assert that some number n satisfies\nthe condition ...n.... Then we can schematize the latter\nreasoning this way:\n\nLine-drawing Sorites \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\Phi\\alpha_1 \\\\\n&{\\sim}\\forall n(\\Phi \\alpha_n) \\\\\\hline\n&\\exists n \\ge 1 (\\Phi\\alpha_{n} \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe line-drawing and inductive forms of the puzzle illustrate well the\nsoritical predicament; apparently, competent users of\n\u2018bald\u2019 both must, and must not, draw a line in the series.\nFor convenience in what follows, most of the examples are framed in\nterms of the conditional or inductive forms of the paradox. Of course,\nan adequate resolution of the sorites will presumably need to disarm\nall versions of it.\n\nWe should mention also an informal version of the paradox, known as\nthe \u201cforced march sorites\u201d (Horgan 1994a; Soames 1999).\nHere it is framed in terms of the hypothetical classifications that\nwould be made by a competent speaker proceeding step by step along a\nsorites series. A competent speaker must say that a single grain of\nwheat does not make a heap; but if that\u2019s right, then she must\nalso say that two grains do not make a heap; and that three grains\ndon\u2019t; and so on until she must say that, e.g., one million\ngrains don\u2019t make a heap. As will emerge, the forced march\nsorites plays an important role in several treatments of the\nparadox.\n\nIt is worth noting that the popular definition of vagueness in terms\nof soriticality (e.g., Wright 1976; Bueno & Colyvan 2012) may well\nbe incorrect. If the sorites is a resolvable fallacy, as most\ntheorists of vagueness believe, then vagueness is not after all a\nsource of paradox. Maybe someone will say that even after the correct\ndiagnosis of the puzzle has been discovered, the argument will remain\na paradox because it will still appear to consist in\nunimpeachable reasoning from true premises to a false conclusion. But\nsuch a view makes vagueness far too contingent a property; for all we\nknow, once we have discovered the proper solution to the puzzle, the\nmajor premise will no longer appear true. It may appear true to the\nuninitiated, but this too would be a dubious way to define\nvagueness\u2014viz., as the property of generating an\nargument that previously appeared, or appears to the uninitiated,\nparadoxical. Bueno and Colyvan say that \u201ca predicate is vague\njust in case it can be employed to generate a sorites argument\u201d\n(2012). But what does \u2018can be employed\u2019 mean here? If a\nsorites argument is a fallacy, a vague predicate cannot be\ncorrectly employed in it. Is the criterion supposed to be\nthat a vague predicate is a term which, when employed incorrectly,\nappears temporarily (to the uninitiated?) to generate a sorites\nparadox? (Raffman 2014: 18\u201319)\n\nIn all likelihood, soriticality is an illusory feature of words like\n\u2018old\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019; their vagueness is real. If\nthat\u2019s right, then apparent soriticality may be best viewed as a\ntemporary symptom of vagueness, or perhaps as an element of\nits \u201csurface characterization\u201d (Smith 2008, e.g., 132; see\nSmith\u2019s third chapter for insight as to what vagueness is).\n3. Responses to the Paradox\n\nAs with any paradox, four broad types of response appear to be\navailable. One might:\n\ndeny that logic applies to soritical expressions.\n\n\nAlternatively, one might accept that the paradox is a legitimate\nargument to which logic applies, but then deny its soundness by\neither\n\nrejecting some premise(s), or\ndenying that it\u2019s valid.\n\n\nThe most drastic response would be to\n\nembrace the paradox and conclude that vague terms are either\nincoherent or vacuous.\n\n\nIn what follows, we consider the major philosophical treatments of the\nsorites and the ways in which they have employed these strategies to\ndissolve the puzzle.\n3.1 Ideal Language Approaches\n\nCommitted as Frege and Russell (see entries on\n Gottlob Frege\n and\n Bertrand Russell)\n were to ideal language doctrines, it is not surprising to find them\npursuing a type (1) response (e.g., Frege 1903[1960], Russell 1923). A\nkey attribute of the ideal language is said to be its precision; hence\nthe vagueness of natural language, including all soritical terms, is a\ndefect to be eliminated. If that\u2019s right, then contrary to what\nmany theorists believe, soritical terms cannot be marshalled to\nchallenge classical logic. Logic simply does not apply to them.\nEchoing this response, Quine contends that although eliminating vague\nterms may incur some cost to ordinary ways of talking, it\u2019s a\ncost worth paying insofar as it allows us to preserve the \u201csweet\nsimplicity\u201d of classical logic (1981: 31\u201337).\n\nHowever, with the demise of ideal language doctrines and subsequent\nrevival of interest in ordinary language, vagueness was no longer\nregarded as a superficial or easily dispensable feature. If logic was\nto have teeth, it had to apply to natural language as it stands;\nsoritical expressions are unavoidable and the paradox must be faced\nhead on. Responses of type (2) do just this and are the most common\nfamily of responses. Logic is seen as applicable to natural language,\nin particular to the paradoxical argument, and the latter is diagnosed\nas resting on a faulty premise. \n3.2 The Epistemic Theory\n\nMost theorists of vagueness conceive of vagueness as a semantic\nphenomenon, as somehow rooted in the meanings of words like\n\u2018tall\u2019 and \u2018old\u2019. As we shall see, semantic\ntheories typically introduce special nonclassical logics and/or\nsemantics in order to resolve the paradox (and accommodate the\nphenomenon of borderline cases). In contrast, epistemicists think that\nvagueness is just a form of ignorance: vague terms have sharp\nboundaries whose locations are hidden from us. In fact, heaps are\nsharply divided from non-heaps, and tall heights are sharply divided\nfrom average ones, but we cannot discover where those divisions lie\n(e.g., Sorensen 1988, 2001; Williamson 1994a,b, 2000; Graff 2000, Fara 2008;\nRescher 2009). On this view, the sorites paradox is dispatched\nimmediately: the major premise, or one of the conditional premises, is\nsimply false. And bivalence is preserved: any application of a vague\nterm either is true or is false, though we cannot always know\nwhich.\n\nWhat facts about the world or natural language or competent speakers\ncould serve to fix sharp boundaries for vague words? According to\nWilliamson (e.g., 1994b: 184), meaning supervenes on use; in other\nwords, the locations of the sharp boundaries of a vague term are a\nfunction of speakers\u2019 dispositions to use it as they do.\n(Insofar as the use of a vague term varies across time, its boundaries\nmay be unstable.) Of course, we cannot know the totality of those\ndispositions, and we do not know the relevant function; and our\nignorance of these factors blocks one path to knowledge of the\nlocations of the term\u2019s boundaries. \n\nAnother possible route to knowledge of the boundary locations is\nblocked by the fact that our knowledge of the application of a vague\nterm is inexact. Inexact knowledge is governed by margin\nfor error principles, viz., principles of the form\n\u2018If x and y differ incrementally on a decisive\ndimension and x is known to be \\(\\Phi\\) (old, blue, etc.), then\ny is\n \\(\\Phi\\)\u2019.[2]\n For example, where knowledge is inexact, we can know of a blue object\nthat it is blue only if objects whose colors are incrementally\ndifferent are blue as well\u2014hence, only in clear cases. In\ncontrast, in the borderline or \u201cpenumbral\u201d region of a\nsorites series for \u2018blue\u2019, where the boundary lives, some\nshade of blue is only incrementally different from, indeed may look\nthe same as, a shade that is not blue; and we cannot know where this\ndifference lies. Consequently, if we classify the former shade as\nblue, that classification is correct by luck, and so does not\nconstitute knowledge. (On the plausible assumption that seeing\nthat something x is blue is sufficient for knowing that x is\nblue, it follows that some blue things are such that we cannot\nsee that they are blue, even under ideal viewing\nconditions.)\n\nThe virtues and the appeal of the epistemic theory are significant,\nand it has earned its share of supporters. At the same time, the view\nmay be hard to accept. Even its proponents grant that epistemicism is\nintuitively implausible; and it seems to multiply mysteries. As a\nfirst approximation, the epistemicist says that\n\n\nvague terms have unknowable sharp boundaries that are fixed by an\nunknown function of their unknowable (i.e., not fully knowable)\npatterns of use. \n\n\nHowever, it seems that the function too must be unknowable, not just\nunknown; for how could we recognize it if we came across it? How could\nwe tell whether we\u2019d gotten hold of the right function but by\ndetermining whether it yields the correct boundaries as its values? If\nthat\u2019s right, then the epistemicist\u2019s thesis must actually\nbe that\n\n\nvague terms have unknowable sharp boundaries that are fixed by an\nunknowable function of their unknowable patterns of use.\n\n\n(Raffman 2014: 10) To be sure, explanations are provided for our\nirremediable ignorance in these cases: for example, we can\u2019t\nknow where the sharp boundaries lie because our knowledge is inexact,\nand we can\u2019t know the total pattern of the term\u2019s use\nbecause \u201cthe data are infinite\u201d (Williamson 1994b:\n184\u2013185), and so on. Nevertheless, epistemicism may have the\nfeel of a \u201cjust so\u201d\n story.[3]\n (See \u00a75.1 for further discussion of Williamson.)\n\nGraff Fara defends a different strain of epistemicism (Graff 2000, Fara 2008). \u00c5kerman\nand Greenough (2010) observe that her account\n\n\nis a form of epistemicism in that vague predicates draw sharp,\nbivalent,\n boundaries.[4]\n Unlike the epistemicism of Sorensen (1988) and Williamson (1994a,b),\nhowever, it is constitutive of vagueness that the boundary can shift\nas a function of changes in [speakers\u2019\n interests].[5]\n (2010: 277)\n\n\nSuch a sharp boundary is unknowable because (among other things) it is\nconstantly moving around in a sorites series, changing location with\nthe speaker\u2019s interests in such a way that he never encounters it\n(Fara 2008: 328). As Stanley puts it, \n\n\nwhen we look for [a] boundary of the extension of [a vague term] in\nits penumbra, our very looking has the effect of changing the\n[extension] of the vague expression so that the boundary is not where\nwe are looking. (2003: 269) \n\n\nThus we can never discover where the boundary lies, and each\nconditional premise seems true so long as we are considering it. (The\nrole of interest-relativity in Graff Fara\u2019s account is discussed\nfurther in\n \u00a73.3.4.)\n \n\nRetention of classical logic and bivalence is supposed to be a chief\nadvantage of the epistemic approach over other views (e.g., Williamson\n1992: 162). Indeed, because bivalence is widely supposed to entail\nsharp boundaries, many theorists of vagueness believe that, for all\nintents and purposes, epistemicism is the only theory that can employ\na bivalent semantics (e.g., Rosenkranz 2003, Keefe\n 2000).[6]\n In particular, they believe that no semantic theory of vagueness can\nbe classical. Subsequent developments cast doubt on this view, however;\nsee\n \u00a73.3.5.\n \n3.3 Semantic Approaches\n\nAs indicated above, vagueness is usually taken to be a semantic\nfeature of language. And if it is a semantic feature, its logic and/or\nsemantics cannot be classical, or so the standard thinking goes.\nStarting in the later part of the 20th century, a number of\nnon-classical logics and semantics have been developed for vague\nterms, each advancing its proprietary resolution of the sorites\nparadox. The extent of the proposed logical innovation varies.\n\nMost semantic theories of vagueness and treatments of the sorites\nconceive of the application of a vague term as indeterminate\nin a certain range of cases. Specifically, in a sorites series for\nvague predicate \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019, it is said to be\nindeterminate\u2014there is \u201cno fact of the\nmatter\u201d\u2014which value is the last \\(\\Phi\\) value. The\nindeterminacy is usually thought to be manifested in the\npredicate\u2019s possession of (possible) borderline cases.\nBorderlines are variously conceived as neither definitely (or\ndeterminately) \\(\\Phi\\) nor definitely not \\(\\Phi\\), or as such that\nthe sentence \u2018x is \\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 is neither true nor\nfalse, or neither super-true nor super-false, or neither true to\ndegree 1 nor false to degree 1, for\n example.[7]\n The shared idea seems to be that the regions of borderline cases in a\nsorites series for \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 constitute the\npredicate\u2019s blurred boundaries; and that because the series\ncontains these indeterminate values, the major premise (or one or more\nconditional premises) of the paradox is either less than true or\nflat-out false. In what follows we review some of the major semantic\ntreatments of the paradox.\n3.3.1 Supervaluationism\n\nIn accord with a principle of least mutilation, one approach adapts\nVan Fraassen\u2019s supervaluation semantics (1966) to the sorites paradox\nand vagueness more generally (e.g., Fine 1975; Keefe 2000). As a\nresult, it endorses a non-bivalent logic that, at least on the face of\nit, retains the classical consequence relation and classical laws\nwhile admitting truth-value gaps. On this view, the challenge posed by\nthe sorites paradox can be met by logical revision in the metatheory\nalone, and a type (2) response is advocated.\n\nUnlike the epistemic conception of vagueness, a semantic conception\nwill treat the apparent semantic indeterminacy of vague predicates as\nreal. Borderline cases are values to which the predicate neither\ndefinitely applies nor definitely does not apply, where\n\u2018definitely\u2019 gets a semantic analysis as opposed to an\nepistemic one. The positive extension of a predicate is given by those\nvalues to which the predicate definitely applies, the negative\nextension by those values to which the predicate definitely does not\napply, and the remaining (penumbral) cases are values to which the\npredicate neither definitely does, nor definitely does not, apply.\nConsistently with a view of vagueness as a semantic deficiency (e.g.,\nFine 1975) or as semantic indecision (e.g., Lewis 1986),\nsupervaluationists define a notion of \u201csuper-truth\u201d\n(\u201csuper-falsity\u201d) as the status of being true (false)\nirrespective of how the semantic deficiency or indecision is resolved\nor precisified, i.e., true (false) on every precisification of the\npredicate. Applying the predicate to something in its positive\nextension results in a super-true sentence, while applying it to\nsomething in its negative extension results in a super-false sentence.\nEquating super-truth with truth simpliciter and super-falsity with\nfalsity simpliciter then results in a non-bivalent logic with\nborderline cases giving rise to truth-value gaps.\n\nWith validity then defined in the usual way as preservation of truth\n(simpliciter), the supervaluationist account of validity coincides\nwith classical validity. In particular, treating laws as zero-premise\narguments, supervaluationism preserves all classical laws. Thus,\ndespite its abandonment of bivalence, supervaluationism validates the\nlaw of excluded middle. For example, irrespective of the vagueness of\n\u2018heap\u2019 it is logically true of any number of grains of\nwheat that it either does or does not make a heap. As a consequence,\nsupervaluation semantics is not truth-functional. It countenances\ninstances of true disjunctions neither of whose disjuncts is (super)\ntrue. Conjunction and the conditional exhibit analogous non-classical\nfeatures.\n\nSince all of the forms taken by the sorites paradox are classically\nvalid, they are also supervaluationally valid. The conclusion of the\nconditional form using Modus Ponens is resisted by noticing that some\nconditional premise fails to be true; though, admittedly, none is\nfalse. The conditional sorites is valid but unsound. More revealing is\nthe diagnosis of the version employing a universal major premise. This\nversion is also deemed unsound due to the failure of one of the\npremises\u2014the universal premise. The universally quantified\nconditional is not true; in fact it is false. While there is no one\nconditional premise that is false, it is nonetheless true according to\nsupervaluation theory that some conditional is. That is to say, it is\ntrue that some n is such that it\u2019s not the case that if\n\\(\\Phi\\alpha_{n}\\) then \\(\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1}\\) (where\n\u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 is soritical relative to the subjects of the\nform \\(\\alpha_{n}\\)).\n\nSince supervaluation semantics admits that the falsity of\n\u2018\\(\u2200n(\\Phi\\alpha_{n} \\rightarrow\n\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\)\u2019 is logically equivalent to the truth of\n\u2018\\(\\exists n(\\Phi\\alpha_n \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\)\u2019,\nthe line-drawing form of the sorites is sound: it is\nsupervaluationally valid since classically valid and its premises are\nuncontestably true. What supervaluation semantics claims to provide is\na formal account of how, contrary to appearances, such a conclusion\ncould be true; it is true since true no matter how one resolves the\nindeterminacy of the vague term involved (i.e., the soritical\npredicate).\n\nIn this way the sorites paradoxes are said to be defused. With\nvagueness viewed as a semantic phenomenon, classical semantics is no\nlonger appropriate as a semantics of vague language and supervaluation\nsemantics is proposed in its place. One immediate concern facing this\nsolution is the fact that it ultimately treats the mathematical\ninduction and line-drawing forms of the sorites in the same manner as\nthe logically conservative epistemic theory does. We are forced to\naccept the avowedly counterintuitive truth of \u2018\\(\\exists\nn(\\Phi\\alpha_n \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\)\u2019 which seems to\npostulate the existence of a sharp boundary, yet the existence of such\na boundary is just what the semantic theory of vagueness is meant to\ndeny. Supervaluationists respond by denying that the conclusion of the\nline-drawing sorites expresses the existence of a sharp boundary.\nThough committed to the claim expressed by \n\n\\[\\tag{a}\n \\mathrm{T} \u2018\\exists n(\\Phi\\alpha_n \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\apos,\n\\]\n\n\nsemantic precision is properly captured only by the expression\n\n\\[\\tag{b} \n\\exists n \\mathrm{T} \u2018(\\Phi\\alpha_n \\amp {\\sim}\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1})\\apos\n\\]\n\n\nand this is clearly denied by supervaluation theory. Whilst it is true\nthat there is some cut-off point, there is no particular point of\nwhich it is true that it is the cut-off point. Since only the latter\nsort of cut-off point is taken to be a sharp boundary, no commitment\nis made to such a boundary of which we are ignorant (contra the\nepistemic theorist).\n\nWith this explanation, however, doubts arise as to the adequacy of the\nlogic. Not only must (b) be properly taken to represent the semantic\nprecision of \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 but we must also be prepared to\nadmit that some existential statements can be true without having any\ntrue instance, thus blocking any inference from (a) to (b). Just as\nthe failure of the metatheoretic principle of bivalence in conjunction\nwith the retention of the law of excluded middle commits the\nsupervaluationist to the presence of true disjunctions lacking true\ndisjuncts, so too must we countenance analogous non-standard behavior\nin the logic\u2019s quantification theory. In effect, the counterintuitive\naspects of the epistemic theory are avoided only at a cost to other\nintuitions.\n\nAt this point the supervaluationist might seek to explain these\nsemantic anomalies by showing how they are mandated by a proper\nunderstanding of the underlying phenomenon of vagueness. More exactly,\nthe suggestion is that a view of vagueness as merely semantic, not\nreflecting any underlying phenomenon of metaphysical vagueness (i.e.,\na view of vagueness as merely representational) might underpin a\nsupervaluationist approach. Fine (1975) appears to promote this\nrepresentational view when defending the law of excluded middle, for\nexample, and Varzi (2001) amongst others also defends\nsupervaluationism in this way. (If successful, such a defense would\nalso provide a principled justification of the common de\nfacto linkage of supervaluation theory and a representational\nview of vagueness.) If this explanation is to be pursued, then the\nformal machinery of supervaluationism solves the paradox only in\nconjunction with a denial of metaphysical vagueness. The metaphysical\ndebate is ongoing. Keefe (2000), on the other hand, opts for a risky\npragmatic defense: though counterintuitive, the semantic anomalies\nthat afflict supervaluationism should be accepted because they are\npart of a theory that fares better overall than any other; no\nadditional defense is necessary.\n\nWilliamson (1994a) points to two further problems apparently\nafflicting the supervaluationist account. First, classical inferences\nlike conditional proof, constructive dilemma, and reductio ad\nabsurdum no longer hold in a language extended to express\nvagueness by the addition of a determinately operator \u2018D\u2019\nor similar. The logic of the extended language is decidedly\nnon-classical. (Dummett [1975] offers an alternative definition of\nvalidity that does not encounter this problem, but Williamson raises\nother objections to it. However, Graff Fara [2003] shows that if we\nstrengthen the notion of consequence to penumbral consequence, we get\nfailures of these principles even in the absence of a determinately\noperator.) Second, problems arise also with regard to the phenomenon\nof higher order vagueness. In accommodating higher order vagueness,\nthe supervaluationist must admit that his proffered concept of truth,\nviz., super-truth, lacks properties that truth is standardly\nthought to possess. Contrary to claims by supervaluationists, then,\ntruth is not super-truth (see Keefe 2000 for a rebuttal).\n3.3.2 Relatives of Supervaluationism\n\nSome criticisms of supervaluationism are mounted from positions closer\nto the supervaluationist\u2019s own perspective, sharing some of its\ncentral insights while abandoning others.\n\nWhile agreeing to the type (2) response advocated by\nsupervaluationists, Burgess and Humberstone (1987) take issue with the\ntheory\u2019s much-discussed retention of the law of excluded middle,\nadopting instead a variant of supervaluationist logic that abandons\nthe classical law in the face of apparent counter-examples presented\nby vagueness. (For discussion and criticism from a supervaluationist\nperspective see Keefe 2000: ch.7.)\n\nAnother variant of supervaluationism is Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s\nparaconsistent (see the entry on paraconsistent logic)\n\u201cdiscussive logic\u201d which underwrites a type (3) response\nto the conditional sorites. A decade before Mehlberg (1958) first\nproposed what was, in effect, a supervaluationist treatment of\nvagueness, a student of\n \u0141ukasiewicz (see entry),\n Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski, published an account of a logic that\nhe proposed as a logic of vague concepts. It was, in fact, the first\nformal system of paraconsistent logic. (Interestingly, both Mehlberg\nand Ja\u015bkowski were students of the\n Lvov-Warsaw School of philosophy (see entry)\n where \u0141ukasiewicz was a professor.) Paraconsistent approaches to\nthe sorites paradox had been advocated by Marxists for some time, with\nborderline case predications providing paradigm examples of\ndialectical situations. The paradox was commonly cited as evidence of\nthe inadequacy of classical logic; but it was not until\nJa\u015bkowski\u2019s pioneering work that the proposal received formal\nexplication. This logic, sometimes now referred to as\n\u201csubvaluationism\u201d to emphasise its duality with the more\nfamiliar supervaluationism, represents the postulated semantic\nindeterminacy as semantic overdetermination, rather than the\nunderdetermination typical of truth-value gap responses to the\nphenomenon of vagueness. While arguing for a supervaluationist\nsemantics for vagueness, Fine (1975) noted that the (subvaluationist)\ntruth-value glut approach can be arrived at by a simple\nreinterpretation of the truth-value gap approach advocated therein.\n(For more on this system and a limited defense thereof see Hyde 1997.\nFor criticism see Keefe 2000: ch.7 and Beall & Colyvan 2001.)\n3.3.3 Degree and Many-Valued Theories\n\nIn contrast to the non-truth-functional logics outlined above, several\ntruth-functional non-classical logics have been proposed, and in\nparticular, many-valued logics (see the entry on many-valued logic).\nAgain vagueness is seen as a properly semantic phenomenon, with the\nattendant indeterminacies providing cases of semantic\nunderdetermination or overdetermination, but truth-functionality is\npreserved. The approaches vary as regards the number of non-classical\ntruth-values deemed appropriate to model vagueness and defuse the\nsorites paradox.\n\nAn initial proposal, first developed in Halld\u00e9n 1949 and\nK\u00f6rner 1960 and revamped in Tye 1994, uses a three-valued logic.\nThe motivation for such a logic is similar to the supervaluationist\u2019s.\nJust as a vague predicate divides objects into the positive extension,\nnegative extension and penumbra, vague sentences can be divided into\nthe true, the false and the indeterminate. Unlike supervaluation\nsemantics, however, the connectives are all defined\ntruth-functionally. Though Halld\u00e9n proposed Kleene\u2019s weak\nthree-valued tables, Kleene\u2019s strong three-valued tables have\ndominated as the preferred choice. (For the relevant tables see Haack\n1974: Appendix.) A recent variation on this theme is Field 2003, which\nsupplements Kleene\u2019s strong tables with an improved,\nnon-truth-functional conditional and distinguishes the three-valued\nsemantics from the common truth-value gap approach.\n\nThe particular response to the sorites paradox then further depends on\nthe definition of validity adopted. A common generalisation of the\nconcept of validity to many-valued logic involves the designation of\ncertain values. A sentence holds (or is assertible) in a many-valued\ninterpretation just if it takes a designated value. Validity may then\nbe defined as the necessary preservation of designated value. (In\nclassical logic, of course, only truth is designated and thus the\ngeneralised concept reduces to the classical concept of necessary\ntruth-preservation.) There are then two non-trivial choices: let the\nset of designated values be {true} or {true, indeterminate}. The\nformer proposal, advocated by K\u00f6rner and by Tye, results in a\ntype (2) response to the paradox. The latter proposal results in a\nparaconsistent logic and yields a type (3) response (see the section\non many-valued systems in the entry on paraconsistent logic). When\ncoupled with the Kleene strong tables, it results in the\nparaconsistent system LP, elsewhere proposed to deal with the liar\nparadox and offered as a logic of vagueness in Weber (2010).\n\nWhile some are motivated to adopt the foregoing three-valued\napproaches for their truth-functionality, others find the consequences\nunacceptable. Those who, for example, find supervaluationist arguments\nfor classical laws plausible will balk at excluded middle claims\nsometimes being other than wholly true or contradictions sometimes\nbeing other than wholly false, as may be the case in such systems. A\nfurther concern with such approaches, also applicable to\nsupervaluationism, is that the invoked tripartite division of\nsentences seems to face objections similar to those that led to the\nabandonment of the bipartite division effected by two-valued classical\nlogic. Due to the phenomenon of higher order vagueness (in particular\nsecond order vagueness) there would seem to be no more grounds for\nsupposing there to exist a sharp boundary between the true sentences\nand indeterminate ones or the indeterminate sentences and false\nsentences than there was for supposing a sharp boundary to exist\nbetween the true sentences and the false ones. The phenomenon of\nvagueness that drives the sorites paradox no more suggests two sharp\nboundaries than it did one. Vague concepts appear to be concepts\nwithout boundaries at all. No finite number of divisions seems\nadequate. Tye (1994) seeks to avoid such difficulties by employing a\nvague metalanguage; Sainsbury (1990) proposes that vague terms are\n\u201cboundaryless\u201d, and that belonging to the extension of a\nvague predicate is more like being attracted to a magnetic pole than\nlike fitting into a pigeon hole (as conventional wisdom might have\nit).\n\nGoguen (1969) and Zadeh (1975), on the other hand, suggest replacing\nclassical two-valued logic with an infinite-valued one. Hyde (2008)\nalso adopts this approach, though the infinite-valued semantics is\nconsidered a purely formal device and not a commitment to degrees of\ntruth (see Cook 2002 in this connection). Infinite-valued or fuzzy\nlogics (see the entry on fuzzy logic) have, however, also been\npromoted precisely for their recognition of degrees of truth. Just as\nbaldness comes in degrees so too, it is argued, does the truth of\nsentences predicating baldness of things. The fact that John is more\nbald than Jo is reflected in the sentence \u2018John is bald\u2019\nhaving a higher degree of truth than \u2018Jo is bald\u2019. Smith\n(2008) advocates a fuzzy logic for just this reason.\n\nInfinite-valued logics are then developed to solve the sorites paradox\nin a variety of ways. As with all many-valued logics, the connectives\nand validity can be defined variously, giving rise to a number of\ndistinct logics. A standard proposal proceeds by way of the\ncontinuum-valued, truth-functional semantics of \u0141ukasiewicz (see\nHaack 1974: Appendix). As with the three-valued case, the type of\nresponse offered to the paradox also crucially depends on the\ndefinition of validity. Where validity is defined as preservation of\ndesignated value and only the maximum value is designated, the\nconditional sorites admits of a type (2) response, as in Hyde 2008.\nHowever, reinstating the validity of classical laws on this general\napproach would require designating more than the maximum value, and a\ntype (3) response results. In contrast, Machina (1976) suggests\ndefining validity as preservation of the lowest degree of truth\npossessed by any of the argument\u2019s premises. On this approach, the\nconditional sorites is invalid and thus a type (3) response again\nensues. Edgington (1996) expounds a distinctly different\nnon-truth-functional degree theory that preserves the principle of\nbivalence and classical logic. On this approach the conditional form\nof the sorites is valid and a type (2) response is advocated. Smith\n(2008) combines a non-bivalent, truth-functional degree theory with\nclassical logic through a distinctive definition of validity. Smith\u2019s\nunique approach provides another type (2) response to the paradox.\n\nAs with three-valued approaches, a number of problems beset\ninfinite-valued approaches to vagueness. Firstly, where the infinitude\nof semantic values are taken to model degrees of truth, the very idea\nof a degree of truth needs explanation. Secondly, if numerical\ntruth-values are used some justification seems required for the\nparticular truth-value assignments. Thirdly, the full implications of\nabandoning the well-understood classical theory in favour of degree\ntheory need spelling out before a proper evaluation of its worth can\nbe made. (On these points see Sainsbury 1995: ch.2; Keefe 2000: ch.4.\nFor an extended defense see Smith 2008: ch.5.) Furthermore, it is far\nfrom clear whether such an approach successfully avoids problems of\nhigher order vagueness. And the assumption of a totally ordered\ntruth-set is overly simple. Not all natural language sentences are\ncomparable as regards their truth. Due to the multi-dimensional nature\nof a concept such as redness, we may be unable to say of two reddish\npatches differing in hue or brightness or colour-saturation, whether\none is redder than the other. (On the latter points see Williamson\n1994a: ch.4; Keefe 2000: ch.4. Smith [2008: ch.6] argues that the\nso-called problem of higher order vagueness is in fact a distinct\nphenomenon and proposes a distinct response.)\n\nSmith defends the view he calls fuzzy plurivaluationism,\nblending together elements of degree theories and supervaluationism.\nThe plurivaluationist semantics departs from the supervaluationist in\nassigning to each vague predicate multiple precise classical\nextensions (\u201cacceptable interpretations\u201d) and abandoning\nthe semantic notion of super-truth. He replaces super-truth with\n\u201cjust a level of talk\u201d governed by the instruction\n\u2018Say that a sentence is simply true if it is true on every\nacceptable interpretation\u2019 (2008: 109\u2013110). Smith\nwrites:\n\n\nThe plurivaluationist will tell us that \u2018This leaf is red\u2019\nand \u2018This leaf is not red\u2019 can be said neither to be\nsimply true nor [to be] simply false, while \u2018This leaf is red or\nnot red\u2019 can be said to be simply true\u2026.[W]e have no\nviolation of truth-functionality [because t]here is no level of\nsemantic fact at which\u2026a disjunction is assigned the value\nTrue, while neither of its disjuncts is. For the only\nsemantic facts are the facts about what is happening in each\nacceptable interpretation\u2014and these are entirely classical\n(hence truth-functional). What we have is just a level of\ntalk laid on top of these semantic facts. The talk\nsounds non-truth-functional, but it is in fact\nepiphenomenal\u2026[I]t does not literally describe a\nnon-truth-functional semantic reality. (2008: 110)\n\n\nWhile \u201csimple truth\u201d may differ significantly from\nsuper-truth, the plurivaluationist endorses the notion that properties\ndefined across multiple valuations (interpretations) play a\nsignificant role in the verbal behavior of competent speakers.\n3.3.4 Contextualism and Its Relatives\n\nDissatisfied with many-valued and supervaluationist approaches, Kamp\n(1981) introduced a contextualist solution to the paradox.\nFocussing on the inductive form of the sorites, Kamp maintained that\nevery instantiation of the major premise is true in its individual\ncontext, where a context consists of the sentences (containing the\ngiven predicate) previously accepted as true. (For Kamp, a context\njust is a set of sentences.) Each instance is true because its\nantecedent must be added to the operative context before its\nconsequent is evaluated, and the neighboring values referred to in the\nantecedent and consequent are only incrementally different. In a\nclassical semantics the universal major premise would then be true as\nwell; but Kamp adopts a non-classical definition dictating that the\nuniversal premise is true in contexts (i) where its instances are true\nand (ii) that remain coherent when the universal premise\nitself is added. The trouble is that adding that premise produces an\nincoherent context that \u201cassign[s] opposite truth values to one\nand the same sentence\u201d (Kamp 1981: 252). Hence the premise is\nfalse, despite all of its instances being true. The contextual\nrelativity of this view is intuitively appealing, and it is free of\nthe need to explain why each instance of the universal premise seems\ntrue when at least one must be false. At the same time, the\nnonstandard semantics for the universal quantifier may seem\nunintuitive.\n\nInspired by Kamp, a subsequent contextualist approach (Raffman 1994)\nhas it that the major premise of the paradox is false but seems true\nfor at least two reasons. First, we confuse it with the true claim\nthat if \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) is \\(\\Phi\\) then \\(\\alpha_{i+1}\\) is \\(\\Phi\\)\nwhen the two values are considered together, pairwise. The pairwise\nclaim, though true, does not license the paradoxical conclusion, which\nmakes reference only to a value considered individually. The second\nreason is a hypothesis, viz., that the major premise can be\nfalse, while seeming true, because the speaker performing a forced\nmarch undergoes a characteristic change in her verbal dispositions at\nthe moment of switching from \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 to\n\u2018not-\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019.  This dispositional change constitutes a\nchange of context (akin to a Gestalt-shift) that allows the\nco-ordinated extensions of \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018not-\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 to shift so that the values \\(\\alpha_{i}\\)\nand \\(\\alpha_{i+1}\\) flanking the switching place are now both\nclassified as not-\\(\\Phi\\); in particular, \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) is\nclassified as \\(\\Phi\\) before the switch and as not-\\(\\Phi\\)\nafterward. Thus neither predicate is ever applied in such a way that\nit distinguishes between the two values relative to the same context,\nand so the speaker is able to switch from \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 to\n\u2018not-\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 without crossing a boundary. The major\npremise seems true because we fail to realize that truth can be\nsecured for all of its instances together only by equivocating on\ncontext.\n\nThe latter view has been criticized for (among other things) applying\nonly to the forced march paradox as opposed to the sorites proper; the\nsorites concerns a series of values (properties like colors, heights,\nages, etc.) in the abstract, independently of anything to do with\nspeakers\u2019 verbal dispositions or behaviors. To put the criticism\nanother way, Raffman\u2019s account may explain why the major premise of\nthe forced march sorites seems true, but it does not touch the paradox\nproper. Inasmuch as their solutions often involve a dynamical element,\nother contextualist treatments of the paradox may be vulnerable to\nthis objection as well.\n\nSoames (1999, 2002) maintains that vague terms are context-sensitive in the manner\nof indexical expressions. Stanley (2003) objects that if Soames is right,\nthen a diagnosis of the paradox as equivocating on an implicit\ncontextual parameter is precluded because indexicals do not admit of\nvariable interpretation in verb phrase ellipsis. Consider the\nstatement \u2018Jack is tired now and Jill is too\u2019. Both the\nfirst and second (implicit) occurrences of the indexical\n\u2018now\u2019 must receive the same interpretation: Jack and Jill\nare tired at the same time. As a result of this fixity of\ninterpretation, versions of the sorites paradox that employ such\nellipses are not open to contextualist resolution, even in the\npresence of the relevant sort of contextual variation. Stanley\nprovides the following example:\n\n\nIf that\\(_{1}\\) is a heap then that\\(_{2}\\) is too, and if\nthat\\(_{2}\\) is, then that\\(_{3}\\) is, and if that\\(_{3}\\) is, then\nthat\\(_{4}\\) is, \u2026 and then that\\(_{n}\\) is\u2026(2003: 272)\n\n\n\nwhere \u2018that\\(_{n}\\)\u2019 refers to the nth element of a\nsorites series for \u2018heap\u2019. If \u2018heap\u2019 is\nindexical, as Soames proposes, there is no room to suppose that its\nextension shifts from conjunct to conjunct in Stanley\u2019s formulation.\nDefending the contextualist, Raffman (2005) responds by denying that\nvague terms are indexicals. She contends that in verb phrase ellipsis,\nvague terms should be understood on the model of \u2018That elephant\nis big, and so is that flea\u2019. Here the extension of\n\u2018big\u2019 varies between the two conjuncts despite the\nellipsis (Ludlow 1989). \n\nAlthough Graff Fara defends an epistemic solution to the\nparadox, she proposes a dynamical contextualist explanation of the\nintuitive appeal of the conditional premise(s). On her view, vague\npredicates express properties that are interest-relative in the sense\nthat their extensions are determined by what counts as significant for\na speaker at a time. The premises of the paradox seem true because a\nspeaker performing a forced march has a \u201cstanding interest in\nefficiency that causes [him] to avoid making discriminations that are\ntoo costly\u201d (Fara 2008: 327-8). For example, for any pair of\nneighboring, incrementally different heights in a sorites series for\n\u2018tall\u2019: when the speaker is actively considering the pair,\nso that the similarity between the two heights is salient, the\ncost of discriminating between them outweighs the benefits: \n\n\n[S]uppose my primary purpose is to choose a cherry tree for the yard.\nA discrimination between two cherry trees that are very similar in\nheight will be very costly given my interest in efficiency. But the\ndiscrimination will be costlier still when I am actively considering\nthe two trees as live options for my purpose. (Fara 2008: 328) \n\n\nOwing to the high cost, the two heights in question will be treated as\n\u201cthe same for present purposes\u201d, and if one of the trees\nis tall, so is the other. In effect, the application of\n\u2018tall\u2019 is governed by an interest-relative form of\ntolerance. (Presumably the speaker\u2019s interest must invariably be\nin cost whenever he considers saliently similar values; in particular,\nthe latter interest cannot be superseded by a different one, like,\nsay, an interest in the location of the sharp boundary.)\n\n\nSome contextualizers, like Burns (1991), make use of the idea that a\npredicate\u2019s sharp boundaries never lie where one is looking, to\ndefend a purely pragmatic analysis of the sorites paradox that leaves\nclassical semantics and logic intact; others see consequences for\nlogic and semantics and advocate a non-classical approach. Shapiro\u2019s\n(2006) book develops a dynamical contextualist theory employing a\ndistinctive variant of supervaluationist logic and semantics to\nprovide a type (2) solution to the paradox. Soames (1999) appeals to\ncontext-sensitivity to defend a three-valued logic of vague\npredicates, postulating boundaries between the determinate exemplars,\nthe determinate non-exemplars, and the borderline cases. Coupled with\nKleene\u2019s strong, three-valued semantics, this non-classical\ncontextualism denies the truth of the universally quantified major\npremise of the paradox while nonetheless also denying its falsity.\n(Tappenden [1993] suggests a similar three-valued approach that\nappeals to context to explain the apparent truth of the universally\nquantified premise, but his use of the notion of context here differs\nsubtly from that of Kamp and Soames.) The conditional sorites also\nadmits of solution. Accepting the standard three-valued\ntruth-conditions for the universal quantifier, Soames (1999) takes the\nconditional sorites to have some non-true conditional premise.\n\nFor criticisms and a helpful taxonomy of different varieties of\ncontextualism (with particular attention to the distinction between\n\u201cextension-shifting\u201d and \u201cboundary-shifting\u201d\nforms of the view), see \u00c5kerman 2009 and \u00c5kerman &\nGreenough 2010.\n3.3.5 The Multiple Range Theory\n\nThe multiple range (\u201cmulti\u2013range\u201d) theory is\na semantic theory of vagueness that purports to retain classical logic\nand \nbivalence.[8]\nHere, the vagueness of an expression consists in its\nhaving multiple equally permissible, arbitrarily different ways of\nbeing applied, relative to a given context (Raffman\n2014: ch.4). In a sorites series, the vagueness of a term is reflected in its\npossession of multiple equally permissible, arbitrarily different\nplaces to stop applying it. Any adequate theory of vagueness must\nacknowledge the existence of permissible stopping places in a sorites\nseries, since competent users of a vague term are required to stop\napplying it before the end. For example, in a sorites series of ages\nproceeding from a clearly old age of 90 to a clearly middle-aged\n(hence not old) age of 50, say for Americans in 2018\u2014make the\ncontext as fine-grained as you like\u2014speakers can permissibly\nstop applying \u2018old\u2019 at 70, or at 67, or 65, or 63.5,\n etc.[9]\n Different speakers will stop at different ages, and the same speaker\nwill stop at different ages on different occasions. Any particular\nstopping place in the series is arbitrary, hence without legislative\nforce; speakers cannot justifiably charge each other with error when\nthey stop at different places. In contrast, a boundary would be\nlegislative; speakers who failed to stop applying \u2018old\u2019 at\nits boundaries would be making mistakes. The distinction between\nboundaries and permissible stopping places is a cornerstone of the\nmulti\u2013range approach.\n\nThis multiplicity of application is said to be reflected in the\npredicate\u2019s semantics in the form of multiple ranges of\napplication. A range of application is just an abstract\nrepresentation, in the semantics, of a permissible way of applying the\npredicate. More formally: a range is a set of values (e.g., ages) to\nwhose instantiations the predicate can competently be applied. In a\nseries from 90 to 50, one range of application of \u2018old\u2019\nmight contain the ages 90\u201370, another 90\u201365, another\n90\u201363.5, and so forth; and the ages (e.g., 90\u201370) in those\nvarious ranges will be instantiated by different people at different\nworlds. \n\nAccording to the multi\u2013range view, a sentence applying a vague\nterm to a given value is true relative to each of its ranges\nthat contain that value, and false relative to each of the others.\nSome ranges of \u2018old\u2019, \u2018borderline\u2019, and\n\u2018middle\u2013aged\u2019 are pictured in the figure below. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Some ranges of application of\n\u2018old\u2019, \u2018middle-aged\u2019, and\n\u2018old[middle-aged] borderline\u2019 \n\n\nNote that each predicate has some ranges that overlap with some ranges\nof the other two. The figure indicates that for a\n63-year-old, the sentence \u2018x is old\u2019 is\ntrue relative to the 3rd range of \u2018old\u2019 and\nrelative to the 4th range and relative to the\n5th, and false relative to the 1st and to the\n2nd. The sentence \u2018x is middle-aged\u2019 is\ntrue relative to the 1st range of \u2018middle-aged\u2019\nand to the 2nd, and false relative to each of the\nothers. The sentence \u2018x is borderline old\u2019 is true\nrelative to each range of \u2018borderline\u2019 except the\n4th, and false relative to the latter.\n\nRaffman warns against two potential confusions. (1) Ranges of\napplication are not precisifications (2014: 102\u20133). To see why, note\nthat on the multi\u2013range view, the predicate\n\u2018borderline\u2019 has ranges of application like any other\nvague term; ranges of application of \u2018borderline\u2019 contain\nborderline values. In contrast, by their nature, precisifications\ncontain no borderline values. Second, a range of (e.g.)\n\u2018old\u2019 contains only old ages, whereas a precisification of\n\u2018old\u2019 contains old ages and not-old (e.g., middle-aged)\nages. Therefore a range contains only a permissible stopping place,\nwhereas a precisification contains a sharp boundary. Consequently,\nthird, whereas a range specifies a way in which competent speakers can\nactually apply the term, a speaker who applied \u2018old\u2019\naccording to a precisification would be (mis)applying it as if it had\nsharp boundaries. Fourth, the multi\u2013range view contains no\nanalogue of super-truth; ordinary truth is truth relative to a single\nrange. (2) Ranges of application are not (aspects of) contexts. Among\nother things, whereas speakers typically are (or can be) aware of the\ncontext they are relativizing to, and can choose a given context for a\ncertain reason, they do not (cannot) choose the ranges to which\nthey will relativize their applications of a vague term. Rather,\nspeakers simply choose how they will classify a given value, and that\nclassification is relativized\u2014automatically, as it were, in\nvirtue of the semantics of the term\u2014to each of its ranges that\ncontains the value in question. Relativization to ranges is not\nsomething speakers do. (In this connection it is worth noting\nthat whereas contextualist treatments of the sorites are typically\ncoupled with a distinct type of semantics for vague terms, e.g., an\nepistemicist or supervaluationist or three-valued semantics, the\nmulti-range solution employs a proprietary multi-range semantics.)\n\n On the multi\u2013range view, the sorites is said to dissolve\nbecause, on pain of equivocation on ranges, every line in the paradox\nmust have its truth-value relative to the same ranges of application\nof \u2018old\u2019. And since each range contains a last age\u2014a\npermissible stopping place\u2014the major premise of the paradox is\nfalse relative to each range of the predicate for any context.\n The multi-range theorist hypothesizes that the major premise of\nthe paradox seems true because we confuse it with two pragmatic rules\nfor the use of vague words (2014: 172\u20135):\n\n (I)  For\nany vague term \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019: If \\(\\alpha_{n}\\) and\n\\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) are only incrementally different on a decisive\ndimension, then any differential application of the predicate as\nbetween them, i.e., any application of \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019 to one\nbut not to the other, must be arbitrary. (That is: arbitrary\nas opposed to impermissible).\n (II) For\nany vague term \u2018\\(\\Phi\\)\u2019: If \\(\\alpha_{n}\\) and\n\\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) are only incrementally different on a decisive\ndimension, then if \\(\\Phi\\alpha_{n}\\) then \\(\\Phi\\alpha_{n+1}\\),\ninsofar as \\(\\alpha_{n}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) are considered\n pairwise.[10]\n\n\nOf its aspects discussed here, the multi\u2013range approach has been\ncriticized most prominently for its commitment to an extreme\nrelativism about truth. Opponents object that it is one thing to\nrelativize truth to possible worlds, and to such contextual factors as\nspeakers, times, spatial locations, comparison classes, speaker\ninterests and purposes, stakes, and standards of assessment; and quite\nanother to relativize truth to factors that vary even after all of\nthose contextual parameters have been fixed. The extremely\nfine-grained relativity proposed by the multi\u2013range theorist\nseems to stretch the notion of truth to the breaking point. Also,\nquestions arise about the (higher order) vagueness of the predicate\n\u2018range of application\u2019 itself; and it\u2019s not clear that\nspeakers ever follow a rule like (I) above. See \u00c5kerman 2014,\n\u00c9gr\u00e9 2015, Sainsbury 2015, Scharp 2015, and Caie 2015\nfor these and other criticisms; and Raffman 2015 for some replies.\n\nWhile there isn\u2019t space to review them here, we should note\nthat theorists of vagueness have done a variety of revealing empirical\nstudies investigating ordinary speakers\u2019 use of vague terms.\nJust for example, see \u00c9gr\u00e9 2009, Ripley 2011, Alxatib\n& Pelletier 2010, Serchuk et al. 2011, Huang 2012, 2013,\n\u00c9gr\u00e9 et al. 2013. \n3.4 Embracing the Paradox\n\nSeveral philosophers have endorsed a type (4) response, drawing the\nradical conclusion that the paradox is unsolvable; we are just stuck\nwith it. The question then is what the paradox shows. Dummett (1975),\nfor example, maintains that vague observational predicates whose\napplication is supposed to be governed by a nontransitive\nindiscriminability relation are incoherent. Such a view appears fatal\nto the familiar notion of a determinate shade of color (see, e.g.,\nJackson 1975; Wright 1975; Peacocke 1992; Graff\n2001; Mills 2002; Hellie 2005; Chuard 2007 for discussion).\n\nA different type (4) response holds that, contrary to appearances,\nconditional sorites paradoxes are sound. For example, it is true,\nafter all, that no number of grains of wheat make a heap. However,\nsuch a view immediately runs into trouble because the paradoxes come\nin pairs. As observed above, there are negative and positive versions\nof the puzzle depending on whether the soritical predicate is negated.\nTo accept all sorites arguments as sound requires assent to the\nadditional claim that, since one grain of wheat makes a heap, any\nnumber does. A radical incoherence follows since there is a commitment\nto all and any number both making a heap and not making a heap.\nSimilarly, everyone is bald and no one is; everyone is rich and no one\nis, and so on.\n\nThe problem is that the soundness of any positive conditional sorites\nundercuts the truth of the unconditional premise of the corresponding\nnegative version, and vice versa. Unless one is prepared to accept a\npandemic of contradictions in natural language, not all sorites can be\nsound. Unger (1979) and Wheeler (1979) propose a more restricted\nembrace. Dissatisfied with responses of types (1) and (3), one accepts\nthe applicability and validity of classical norms of reasoning.\nNonetheless, dissatisfaction with responses of type (2) considered so\nfar\u2014rejecting some conditional premise\u2014leaves open the\noption of either rejecting the minor (unconditional) premise or\naccepting it and, with it, the soundness of the paradox. What is\nadvocated is the soundness of those sorites which deny heapness,\nbaldness, hirsuteness, richness, poverty, etc. of everything\u2014a\ntype (4) response\u2014and the corresponding falsity of the\nunconditional premise of all respective positive variants of the\nargument\u2014a type (2) response. Terms like \u2018heap\u2019,\n\u2018bald\u2019, \u2018hirsute\u2019, \u2018rich\u2019 and\n\u2018poor\u2019 apply to nothing. (For criticisms, see Williamson\n1994a: Ch. 6.)\n4. Unification with the Liar Paradox\n\nThe sorites paradox has traditionally been seen as unrelated in any\nsubstantially interesting way to the semantic and set-theoretic\nparadoxes of self-reference. However, McGee (1991) and Tappenden\n(1993) proposed a unified treatment of the liar and sorites paradoxes\nbased on similarities between vague predicates and the truth\npredicate. More recently, Field (2003: 262) speaks of \n\n\nsome temptation to connect up the [semantic paradoxes and the\nparadoxes of vagueness] by viewing the semantic paradoxes as due to\nsomething akin to vagueness or indeterminacy in semantic concepts like\n\u2018true\u2019. \n\n\nField 2008 further develops this theme, though it is devoted primarily\nto a resolution of the liar, Curry\u2019s and other paradoxes. Field\u2019s\napproach is by way of a logic that abandons the law of excluded\nmiddle.\n\nSome see unification as much more clearly indicated by the supposed\nfact that the semantic and sorites paradoxes themselves are \u201cof\na kind\u201d. Thus Colyvan (2009) points to a number of ways in which\nparadoxes might be thought to be of a kind per se, concluding\nthat the liar and the sorites are examples and thus deserving of a\nsimilar solution. Priest (2010) adds weight to this claim, arguing\nthat both the paradoxes of self-reference and the sorites paradox have\na common underlying structure, satisfaction of what Priest calls\n\u201cthe inclosure schema\u201d. On the assumption that this common\nstructure is sufficient to warrant a similar treatment, Priest\nadvocates a paraconsistent response to the sorites having elsewhere\ndefended a paraconsistent response to the paradoxes of self-reference.\nIn fact, as with paradoxical sentences, some vague sentences involving\nborderline cases will furnish examples of true contradictions,\ndialethias.\n5. Philosophical Lessons\n\nHaving considered several major families of responses to the logical\nand semantic challenges posed by the sorites, it is worth reflecting\nupon some of the broader philosophical issues that the problem raises.\nSince the deeply puzzling phenomenon of vagueness manifests itself\nfirst and foremost as a linguistic phenomenon, it is unsurprising that\nthe responses variously intersect with problems concerning meaning,\ntruth and reference.\n5.1 Meaning as Use\n\nA challenge posed for the epistemic theorist\u2019s response is that on\nsuch a view the commonly supposed connection between meaning and use\nappears to be strained if not severed altogether (see again\n \u00a73.2).\n While the margin-for-error principle discussed in Williamson 1994a\nmight serve to explain how we could be ignorant of the postulated\nsharp boundaries, it might be thought that since our use of vague\nterms does not draw sharp boundaries, it could not contain them given\nthe generally accepted connection between meaning and use. As\nWilliamson reports this concern others might have, \u201cthe\nepistemic view of vagueness sets truth-conditions floating\nunacceptably free of our dispositions to assent and dissent\u201d\n(1994a: 205). It seems that such a view must abandon the idea that our\nuse determines meaning.\n\nOne obvious response is that the connection between meaning and use is\nnot as strong as might be supposed. Nature might also sometimes play a\nrole in determining meaning, e.g., in the case of natural kind terms;\nbut for a predicate like, say, \u2018thin\u2019, it is unlikely that\nnature provides what our use does not. Williamson further responds by\npointing out that the determination thesis at issue is really a\nsupervenience thesis\u2014meaning supervenes on use\u2014and this\nthesis can be agreed to by epistemicists. Granted, the epistemicist\ncannot say exactly how meaning supervenes on use, and so cannot\ncalculate the meaning or truth-conditions of an application of a vague\nterm from facts about use. However, the response continues, this\ninability is something which all theorists ought to accept. To suppose\nthat the epistemic theory must make good on this count is to place\nunreasonable expectations on the theory (see Williamson 1996 and\nBurgess 2001 for further discussion). \n\nThe supervenience thesis is also challenged by symmetry\nconsiderations. When confronted with a borderline case of\n\u2018thin\u2019, the argument goes, a language user will neither\nassent to the application of the term nor to the application of its\nnegation. Patterns of dissent are similarly symmetrical with respect to the two \nclaims.[11] \nAnd yet despite this symmetry at the level of use\nit must be broken at the level of truth and falsity where one of the\nterms or its negation truly applies according to the theory; one or\nthe other claim is true and the other false. If our patterns of use\nleave the matter equally unsettled either way then how can the truth\nof the matter be settled without arbitrariness and a severing of the\nconnection between meaning and use? The answer, Williamson suggests,\nlies in the fact that truth and falsity are not symmetrical notions.\nFalsity obtains in the absence of truth, so where there is symmetry at\nthe level of use, falsity reigns. Whether this response succeeds is\ndebated in Burgess 2001 and Weatherson 2003.\n5.2 Truth and the T-schema\n\nAs already noted in connection with supervaluationism, theories that\nabandon bivalence have been charged with having to reject the required\nTarskian constraint on truth encapsulated in his T-schema:\n\u2018p\u2019 is true if and only if p. The rejection of bivalence\nin the context of the T-schema is said to lead to absurdity\n(Williamson 1994a: ch. 7; see Wright 1994 for criticism). This charge\napplies more generally to any non-bivalent theory of vagueness coupled\nwith the T-schema. If validated, the pressure to abandon bivalence in\nthe presence of vagueness would then cast doubt on a deflationary\naccount of truth. Many will find this consequence untoward. Field\n(2008), for example, is devoted to saving this account of truth from a\nrange of paradoxes and rejects a truth-value gap approach.\n\nSupervaluationists have responded by noting that though the T-schema\nis not true, a corresponding mutual entailment thesis is not\nthreatened: \u201c\u2018p\u2019 is true\u201d entails and is\nentailed by \u2018p\u2019. However, the latter claim is strictly\nweaker than the corresponding claim involving the conditional\naccording to supervaluationism, and one may wonder whether the weaker\ncommitment is sufficient to capture what matters about truth (see\nKeefe 2000: ch. 8). Others have taken issue with the Williamson\nargument by pointing out that in the context of nonbivalent approaches\nto vagueness, negation can be variously defined and that the argument\nsupposes a rejection of bivalence invoking a particularly strong\nreading of negation. In response Williamson contends that while an\nappropriately weak account of negation can be offered sufficient to\nundermine the argument for a general acceptance of bivalence, in the\nspecial case of vagueness the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness\nprovides the materials for similarly reducing this weaker rejection to\nabsurdity. (See Williamson 1994a: 193f. and Pelletier & Stainton\n2003 for further discussion.)\n\nThe claim then is that even if there were a sense in which truth was\nnon-bivalent and nonetheless satisfied the T-schema, thus making\navailable a deflationary account, the particular nature of the problem\nposed by vagueness precludes such a synthesis. The depth of the\nproblem, as evidenced by the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness,\nshows that it cannot be accounted for by a rejection of bivalence\nalone.\n5.3 The Inscrutability of Reference\n\nAttempts to solve the sorites paradox also throw issues of reference\ninto sharp relief. Unlike epistemic responses to the sorites which\npostulate inscrutable boundaries, supervaluationism is frequently\nassociated with a semantic approach to vagueness seemingly committed\nto the inscrutability of reference.\n\nConsider a sorites paradox using the predicate \u2018is on\nEverest\u2019 using the series of millimetre discriminations along a\nline from its peak to the valley floor below. The first point (the\nsummit) is clearly on Everest. The last (in the valley) clearly is\nnot. And there is no clear point in between where we would draw the\nsharp boundary separating the mountain from its surrounds. The\nvagueness or indeterminacy that underwrites this sorites paradox is,\non this approach, not a result of epistemic limitations, nor a result\nof indeterminacy in Everest itself but, rather, arises as a result of\nindeterminacy surrounding what to count as the referent of the term.\nAccording to the supervaluationist, vagueness is a matter of semantic\nindecision, as it is frequently put. In the case to hand, there is\nsimply no fact of the matter as to exactly what portion of earth is\nreferred to. There is a range of admissible candidates, all with equal\nclaim to be Everest, amongst which we have simply not decided, nor (to\nparaphrase Lewis) is anyone stupid enough to try. In such a case,\noverlapping the problem of the many (see the entry on the problem of\nthe many), the theory commits to a singular term\n\u2018Everest\u2019, though apparently a denoting phrase, lacking\nany unique determinate referent. This accords with Russell\u2019s much\nearlier analysis of vagueness as \u201cone-manyness in\ndenotation\u201d.\n\nAs Keefe (2000: ch. 7.1) points out, supervaluationism thus understood\nnonetheless makes true the claim that there is but one (sharply\nbounded) Mt Everest (thus claiming a solution to the problem of the\nmany, and to the foregoing sorites paradox since it is true that there\nis a sharp cut-off point to being on Everest) even if there is no one\n(sharply bounded) mountain of which it is true that it is the thing\nreferred to by \u2018Everest\u2019 (and thus no point on the\nmountain of which we can say that it is truly the cut-off point).\nThere is but one Everest but there is no fact of the matter what it\nis.\n\nAs with earlier problems concerning the role of existential\nquantification in supervaluationism, one can debate whether this is a\nconsequence to be embraced or an untoward consequence undermining the\ntheory being advanced. It is certainly surprising that reference is\ninscrutable in this way. Moreover, such cases are not the exception;\ngiven the ubiquity of vague singular terms such cases appear to be the\nrule (see Lewis 1993; McGee & McLaughlin 2000; Morreau 2002).\n",
