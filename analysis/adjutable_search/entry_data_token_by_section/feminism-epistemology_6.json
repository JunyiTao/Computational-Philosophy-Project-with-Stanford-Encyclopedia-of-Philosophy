Against the\nproject of feminist science, many philosophers hold that good science\nis neutral among social, moral, and political values. Lacey (1999)\ndistinguishes the following claims of value-neutrality: (1)\nAutonomy: science progresses best when uninfluenced by\nsocial/political movements and values. (2) Neutrality:\nscientific theories do not imply or presuppose judgments about\nnoncognitive values, nor do scientific theories serve any particular\nnoncognitive values more fully than others. (3) Impartiality:\nThe only grounds for accepting a theory are its relations to the\nevidence. These grounds are impartial among rival noncognitive values.\n\n\nOf these claims, neutrality is the most dubious, because it depicts\nthe grounds for accepting social, political and moral values as\ndetached from evidence about human potentialities and about what\nhappens when people try to realize these values in practice. If this\nwere true, then the defenders of keeping mathematics a male preserve\nwould not have bothered arguing that women were not intellectually\ncapable of doing mathematics\u2014and feminists would not have\nbothered disputing this claim. Neutrality is less a claim about the\ncharacter of science than about the purportedly\n\u201cfact-free\u201d justification of social and political values.\nAs a claim about the latter, it is false (Anderson 2004, Taylor 1985,\nTiles & Oberdiek 1995).\n\nThe core claim of value-neutrality is impartiality. Only facts can\nsupply the warrant for other facts. Autonomy, in turn, is defended as\na means to ensure impartiality. Social movements are thought to\nthreaten impartiality because their influence on science is thought to\nconsist in pressuring scientists to ignore the facts and validate\ntheir worldviews. Defenders of value-neutral science object to the\nidea of feminist science because they view it as threatening autonomy,\nand thereby impartiality.\n\nThe Basic Underdetermination Argument. Feminist\nempiricists reply to this challenge by extending Quine\u2019s\nargument that theory is underdetermined by evidence (Longino 1990,\nNelson 1993). Any body of observations counts as evidence for\nparticular hypotheses only in conjunction with certain background\nassumptions. Vary the background assumptions, and the same\nobservations will support different hypotheses. For example, the\nfailure to observe stellar parallax in the 16th century was taken as\nevidence that the Earth stands still by geocentrists, and as evidence\nthat the stars are very far away by heliocentrists. No logical\nprinciple stops scientists from choosing different background\nassumptions. In practice, scientists face constraints in selecting\nbackground assumptions, based on cognitive values such as simplicity\nand conservatism (resistance to revising assumptions on which many\nother beliefs depend). But with respect to open questions, such\ncognitive values rarely limit the scope for choice down to one option,\nand their interpretation and weights are contestable in any event\n(geocentrism was overturned by overriding conservatism). Feminist\nempiricists conclude that, given the scope for choice in background\nassumptions, no methodological principle forbids scientists from\nselecting their background assumptions on account of their fit with\nsocial and political values. Hence, feminist scientists may select\ntheir background assumptions on account of their fit with feminist\nvalues.\n\nStanding alone, the underdetermination argument does not help us\ndiscriminate error-generating biases from biases that serve as\ncognitive resources. Additional criteria are needed. Anderson (2004)\nargues that the chief danger of value-laden inquiry is wishful\nthinking or dogmatism (Anderson 2004). To avoid this danger, the\nvalue-laden character of the background assumptions linking evidence\nto theories should not foreclose the possibility of discovering that\none\u2019s values are mistaken, because (for example) they are based\non false beliefs about human potentialities or the consequences of\nputting certain values into practice. If women really can\u2019t do\nmath, the values incorporated into feminist science should not close\noff this possibility in advance. Although, in setting out to test this\nsexist hypotheses, women scientists presuppose their own mathematical\ncompetence, this does not preclude their discovering otherwise. To\navoid dogmatism and wishful thinking, they need only make their\ncalculations accountable to public criticism.\n\nThe Basic Pragmatic Strategy. The above reflections\nprovide a standard for determining when socially value-laden inquiry\nhas gone wrong. But how can social values function as an epistemic\nresource? Some feminist epistemologists stress the pragmatic\nfunctions of inquiry (Anderson 1995b). All inquiry begins with a\nquestion. Questions may be motivated by practical interests in\nunderstanding the nature and causes of situations judged to be\nproblematic, and in finding out how to improve those situations. Defenders of the value-neutrality of science acknowledge that pragmatic factors legitimately influence the choice of objects of study. Feminist epistemologists argue that practical interests properly shape the product of inquiry by introducing new dimensions\nof evaluation to theories. We can ask not only whether theories are\nbacked by evidence, but whether they are cast in forms that are\ncognitively accessible to the situated knowers who want to use these\ntheories, whether they help these knowers solve their problems, and\nwhether they answer the questions they were designed to answer. A set\nof statements can be true, yet fail these pragmatic tests. The basic\npragmatic strategy for defending feminist science, and any inquiry\nshaped by social and political values, is to show how the pragmatic\ninterests of that inquiry license or require a particular mode of\ninfluence of values on the process, product, and uptake of the product\nof inquiry, while leaving appropriate room for evidence to play its\nrole in testing hypotheses. Values do not compete with evidence in\ndetermining conclusions, but play different, cooperative roles in\nproperly conducted inquiry (Anderson 1995b, 2004).\n\nTypes of Legitimate Influence of Social Values in\nScience. Feminist philosophers of science stress the variety\nof roles for social and political values in science, and the\ncontingency of their effects (Wylie and Nelson 2007). We must examine\nhow particular values operate in particular scientific investigations\nand judge whether they are closing off the possibility of discovering\nunwelcome facts, leading scientists to reason dogmatically, or\ninsulating their findings from critical scrutiny\u2014or rather\nwhether the values are enabling new discoveries. Feminist\nepistemologists and philosophers of science have defended the\nfollowing types of influence of social values on theory choice.\n\nSelection and weighting of cognitive values. Kuhn (1977)\nargued that scientists need to appeal to cognitive values to take up\nthe slack between theory and evidence. His list of cognitive values\nincludes accuracy, scope, simplicity, fruitfulness, internal\nconsistency, and consistency with other beliefs (conservatism).\nLongino (1994) argues that feminists have reason to prefer theories\nthat manifest other cognitive values, such as diffusion of power.\nDiffusion of power, like simplicity, is not a truth-oriented cognitive\nvalue. Both count as cognitive values because they make theories\ncognitively accessible. Diffusion of power recognizes that cognitive\naccessibility is relative to the situation of the knower. Both\nsimplification and diffusion of power stand in tension with truth, in\nthat theories that embody them not only ignore many complex truths,\nbut may even make false claims. Whether this is bad depends on whether\nthe truths ignored or the inaccuracies allowed are important.\nThis can be judged only relative to the interests that the\ninvestigation ought to serve. All legitimate research programs must\nseek empirical adequacy, which requires that theories account for\nobservations. How much accuracy this requires depends on how much the\nexpected usefulness of the knowledge will be compromised by larger\nrisks or margins of error. The situation and pragmatic interests of\nthe inquirer or of the users of a theory may therefore legitimately\naffect the selection and weighting of cognitive values in theory\nchoice.\n\nStandards of Proof. The argument from inductive risk holds\nthat theories should be accepted or rejected depending on the relative\ncosts of type I error (believing something false) and type II error\n(failing to believe something true). In medicine, clinical trials are\nroutinely stopped and results accepted as genuine notwithstanding\nhigher P-values than the conventional <5%, if the results are\ndramatic enough and the costs to patients of not acting on them are\nhigh enough. Hare-Mustin and Maracek (1994) argue, by parallel\nreasoning, that whether studies that find gender differences, or that\nfail to find them, should be accepted depends on the relative costs of\nAlpha Bias (exaggerating differences) and Beta Bias (neglecting\ndifferences) in the context at hand.\n\nClassification. The ways phenomena are classified may\nlegitimately depend on social values. In medicine, the distinction\nbetween health and disease reflects both causal judgments and ethical\njudgments about human welfare and appropriate ways of dealing with\nproblems. A condition judged bad for human beings is not classified as\na disease unless medical intervention is considered an appropriate and potentially\neffective way to deal with it. Feminist inquiries, too, raise\nquestions about the causes of women\u2019s oppression that require\nclassifying phenomena as instances of rape, sexual objectification,\nsex discrimination, and so forth\u2014classifications tied to their\nmeeting both empirical and evaluative criteria (Anderson 1995a,\n1995b). In general, when inquiry seeks to answer a question about\nvalue-laden phenomena, such as the impact of certain practices on\nhuman welfare, or whether certain institutions are fair or\ndiscriminatory, the contours of the empirical phenomena to be studied\nwill be defined by evaluative judgments (Intemann 2001, 2005).\n\nMethods. The methods selected for investigating phenomena\ndepend on the questions one asks and the kinds of knowledge one seeks,\nboth of which may reflect social interests. Experimental methods in\nsocial science may be good for discovering factors that can be used to\ncontrol people\u2019s behavior in similar settings. But to grasp\ntheir behavior as action\u2014that is, as attempts by agents\nto govern their behavior through their understandings of what they are\ndoing\u2014requires different empirical methods, including\nparticipant observation and qualitative interviews (which allow\nsubjects to delineate their own systems of meaning). Standpoint\ntheories, as critical theories, seek to empower the subjects of study\nby helping them forge liberatory self-understandings. These may\nrequire different methods of inquiry\u2014for example,\nconsciousness-raising (MacKinnon 1989).\n\nCausal Explanations; Models; Explanations of Meaning;\nNarratives. The number of factors that affect the occurrence of\nmost human phenomena is too large to comprehend or test in a single\nmodel. Investigators must therefore select a subset of causal factors\nto include in their models. This selection may be based on fit with\nthe values and interests of the investigator (Longino 1990, 2001).\nThese interests often reflect background social and moral judgments of\nblame, responsibility, and acceptability of change. Conservatives are\nmore likely to study divorce and out-of-wedlock birth as causes of\nwomen\u2019s poverty, whereas feminists are more likely to focus on\nother causes\u2014for example, the exclusion of women from\nbetter-paid jobs, failures of state support for dependent-care work\nwithin the family, the weak bargaining power of women in marriage, and\nnorms of masculinity that lead fathers to avoid significant\nparticipation in child-rearing. These causal explanations are not\nincompatible. Normative interests may also determine whether one\nmodels only main effects or also interaction effects on outcomes\nrelevant to human welfare. A variable\u2014say, a certain lifestyle\u2014that\nhas a positive main effect on a population may have a negative effect\non some subpopulations. Whether one models and tests for such effects\nmay depend on whether one believes that one lifestyle does or should\nfit all, or whether one values pluralism and ontological heterogeneity\n(Anderson 2004).\n\nOften inquirers seek not merely a set of facts, but what the facts\nmean. The meaning or significance of facts depends on their relations\nto other facts. Even if two inquirers agree on the causal facts, they\nmay still disagree about their meaning because they relate the facts\nin different ways, reflecting their background values. Feminists may\nagree with conservatives that divorce is a cause of the feminization\nof poverty, but deny that this means that women are better off\nmarried. They argue that marriage itself, with its gendered division\nof domestic and market labor, constitutes one of the major structural\ndisadvantages women face, setting them up for worse outcomes in the\nevent of divorce. Conservatives, viewing marriage as an indispensable\ncondition of the good life, are no more willing to view marriage in\nthis light than most people would be willing to blame oxygen for the\noccurrence of house fires. It might be thought that scientists should\nstick to the facts and avoid judgments of meaning. But most of the\nquestions we ask demand answers that fit facts into larger, meaningful\npatterns. Scientists therefore cannot help but tell stories, which\nrequire the selection of narrative frameworks that go beyond the facts\n(Haraway 1989). This selection may depend both on their fit with the\nfacts and on their fit with the background values of the\nstoryteller.\n\nFramework Assumptions. As we ascend to higher levels of\nabstraction, general framework assumptions constitute the object of\nstudy. Some of these are disciplinary. Economics studies humans as\nself-interested, instrumentally rational choosers. Social psychology\nstudies humans as responding to socially meaningful situations.\nBehavioral genetics studies human conduct as influenced by their\ngenes. The selection of framework assumptions may depend on their fit\nwith the interests of the inquirer (Longino 1990, Tiles 1987).\nFeminists, being interested in promoting women\u2019s agency, tend to\nprefer frameworks that permit the representation of women as agents.\nThis does not guarantee that empirical findings will confirm the\nbackground assumption that women\u2019s agency is critical to the\nphenomena under investigation. The value-laden selection of framework\nassumptions thus need not lead to a vicious circle of reasoning,\nbecause it is still left up to the evidence to determine how\nsuccessful the assumptions are in explaining the phenomena of\ninterest.\n\nPluralism and naturalized moral epistemology as upshots of\nvalue-laden inquiry. Because inquirers select background\nassumptions in part for their fit with their varied interests and\nvalues, their background assumptions will also vary. Feminist\nepistemologists urge us to embrace this fact (Haraway 1991, Harding\n1998, Longino 2001). Pluralism of theories and research programs\nshould be accepted as a normal feature of science. As long as the\ndifferent research programs are producing empirical successes not\nproduced by the others, and avoiding clear error and viciously\ncircular or dogmatic reasoning, we should treat the value-biases\nanimating them as epistemic resources, helping us discover and\nunderstand new aspects of the world and see them in new perspectives.\nFeminist science takes its place as one set of legitimate research\nprograms among others. This does not imply relativism. Value-laden\nresearch programs are still open to internal and external critique. A\nnaturalized epistemology that rejects neutrality allows that\nobservations may undermine any background assumptions, including value\njudgments (Anderson 2004).\n\nOne way to support this last claim is to advance Quinean holism, and\ninsist that any evidence may bear on any belief or value (Nelson\n1990). While accepting the bi-directional influence of facts and\nvalues, Anderson (2004) rejects holism, arguing that some observations\nbear closer relevance relations than others to specific values.\nFurther progress in understanding legitimate and fruitful interactions\nof facts and values in scientific inquiry will likely involve\nnaturalizing moral epistemology, to get a clearer view of the bearing\nof observations on values. Tobin and Jaggar (2013) offer one way to\nnaturalize feminist moral epistemology.\n",
