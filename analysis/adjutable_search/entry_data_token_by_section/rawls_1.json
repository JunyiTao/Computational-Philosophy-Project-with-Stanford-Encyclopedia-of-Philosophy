The first role is practical:\nphilosophy can propose grounds for reasoned agreement when sharp\npolitical divisions threaten to lead to violent conflict. Rawls cites\nHobbes\u2019s Leviathan as an attempt to solve the problem\nof order during the English civil war, Locke\u2019s Letter on\nToleration as responding to the Wars of Religion, as well as the\nphilosophy that emerged from the debates over the US Constitution, and\nfrom debates over the extension of slavery before the American civil\nwar.\n\nA second role of political philosophy is to help citizens to orient\nthemselves within their own social world. Philosophy can meditate on\nwhat it is to be a member of a certain society\u2014in a democracy,\nan equal citizen\u2014and offer a unifying framework for answering\ndivisive questions about how people with that political status should\nrelate to each other.\n\nA third role is to probe the limits of political possibility.\nPolitical philosophy must describe workable political arrangements\nthat can gain support from real people. Yet within these limits,\nphilosophy can be utopian: it can depict a social order that is the\nbest that we can hope for. Given humans as they are, philosophy\nimagines laws as they might be.\n\nA fourth role of political philosophy is reconciliation: \u201cto\ncalm our frustration and rage against our society and its history by\nshowing us the way in which its institutions\u2026 are rational, and\ndeveloped over time as they did to attain their present, rational\nform\u201d (JF, 3). Philosophy can show that human life is\nnot simply domination and cruelty, prejudice, folly and corruption;\nbut that, at least in some ways, it is better that it has become as it\nis.\n\nRawls views his own work as a practical contribution to resolving the\nlong-standing tension in democratic thought between liberty and\nequality, and to limning the limits of civic and of international\ntoleration. He offers the members of democratic countries a way of\nunderstanding themselves as free and equal citizens of a society that\nis fair to all, and he describes a hopeful vision of a stably just\nconstitutional democracy doing its part within a peaceful\ninternational community. To individuals who are frustrated that their\nfellow citizens and fellow humans do not see the whole truth as they\ndo, Rawls offers the reconciling thought that this diversity of\nworldviews results from, and can support, a social order with greater\nfreedom for all.\n",
