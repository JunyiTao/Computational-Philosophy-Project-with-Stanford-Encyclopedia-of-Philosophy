    "main_text": "Varieties of business ethics\n1. Varieties of business ethics\n\nMany people engaged in business activity, including accountants and\nlawyers, are professionals. As such, they are bound by codes of\nconduct promulgated by professional societies. Many firms also have\ndetailed codes of conduct, developed and enforced by teams of ethics\nand compliance personnel. Business ethics can thus be understood as\nthe study of professional practices, i.e., as the study of the\ncontent, development, enforcement, and effectiveness of the codes of\nconduct designed to guide the actions of people engaged in business\nactivity. This entry will not consider this form of business ethics.\nInstead, it considers business ethics as an academic discipline.\n\nThe academic field of business ethics is shared by social scientists\nand normative theorists. But they address different questions. Social\nscientists try to answer descriptive questions like: Does corporate\nsocial performance improve corporate financial performance, i.e., does\nethics pay (Vogel 2005; Zhao & Murrell 2021)? Why do people engage\nin unethical behavior (Bazerman & Tenbrunsel 2011; Werhane et al.\n2013). How can we make them stop (Warren, Gaspar, & Laufer 2014)?\nI will not consider such questions here. This entry focuses on\nquestions in normative business ethics, most of which are variants on\nthe question: What is ethical and unethical in business?\n\nNormative business ethicists (hereafter the qualifier\n\u2018normative\u2019 will be assumed) tend to accept the basic\nelements of capitalism. That is, they assume that the means of\nproduction can be privately owned and that markets\u2014featuring\nvoluntary exchanges between buyers and sellers at mutually agreeable\nprices\u2014should play an important role in the allocation of\nresources. Those who reject capitalism will see some debates in\nbusiness ethics (e.g., about firm ownership and control) as\nmisguided.\n\nSome entities \u201cdo business\u201d with the goal of making a\nprofit, and some do not. Pfizer and Target are examples of the former;\nRutgers University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are examples of\nthe latter. An organization identified as a \u2018business\u2019 is\ntypically understood to be one that seeks profit, and for-profit\norganizations are the ones that business ethicists focus on. But many\nof the ethical issues described below arise also for non-profit\norganizations and individual economic agents.\n",
