    "main_text": "The Late Period || Peter of Mantua\n4.4 Peter of Mantua\n\nStrobino 2012 contains the first significant discussion of Peter of\nMantua\u2019s account of insolubles in modern times. Mantua\u2019s\ntreatise, composed in the early 1390s, shows influences from Albert of\nSaxony and William Heytesbury (whose opinions he criticises\nextensively) and of Wyclif\u2019s theory. Mantua\u2019s theory is\nalso mentioned in Paul of Venice\u2019s Logica Magna, in\naddition to the fifteen theories Paul specifically enumerates. Once\nagain, the theory frames itself in Aristotelian terms, whereby the\ninsolubles are absolutely or unqualifiedly false, but true in a\ncertain respect. Like Wyclif\u2019s, his main notion of truth\n(Wyclif\u2019s third, Mantua\u2019s second) requires that\npropositions not be self-referential. If they are self-referential,\nthey are false in this sense. But Mantua\u2019s other notion (similar\nto but narrower than Wyclif\u2019s second) applies only to\nself-referential propositions that are true according to their primary\nsignification. For example, \u2018This proposition is not true\u2019\nis false in the first sense (since it is self-referential), but true\nin the second sense, because it is self-referential and not true (in\nthe first sense). Strobino (\u00a7 3.4) argues that Mantua\u2019s\ntheory, like Wyclif\u2019s, cannot deal with the problem of revenge,\ne.g., with such a proposition as \u2018This proposition is not true\nin either sense\u2019.\n",
