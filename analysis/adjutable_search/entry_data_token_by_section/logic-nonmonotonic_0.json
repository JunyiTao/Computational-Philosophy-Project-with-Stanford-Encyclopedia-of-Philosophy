    "main_text": "Dealing with the dynamics of defeasible reasoning\n1. Dealing with the dynamics of defeasible reasoning\n\nDefeasible reasoning is dynamic in that it allows for a retraction of\ninferences. Take, for instance, reasoning on the basis of normality or\ntypicality assumptions. While we infer that Tweety flies on the basis\nof the information that Tweety is a bird and the background knowledge\nthat birds usually fly, we have good reasons to retract this inference\nwhen learning that Tweety is a penguin or a kiwi. \n\nAnother example is abductive reasoning\n (Aliseda 2017).\n Given the observation that the streets are wet we may infer the\nexplanation that it has been raining recently. However, recalling that\nthis very day the streets are cleaned and that the roof tops are dry,\nwe will retract this inference. \n\nAs a last example take probabilistic reasoning where we infer\n\u201cX is a B\u201d from \u201cX is an\nA and most As are Bs\u201d. Clearly, we may\nlearn that X is an exceptional A with respect to being a\nB and in view of this retract our previous inference. \n\nOur previous examples are instances of ampliative reasoning. It\nis based on inferences for which the truth of the premises does not\nguarantee or necessitate the truth of the conclusion as in deductive\nreasoning. Instead, the premises support the conclusion defeasibly,\ne.g., the conclusion may hold in most/typical/etc. cases in which the\npremises hold. \n\nReasoning may also turn defeasible when applied to an inconsistent\nstock of information, possibly obtained via different sources.\nClassical logic is not a viable option in such situations, since it\nallows us to derive just any consequence. A more cautious approach is\nto consider maximal consistent subsets (with respect to set inclusion)\nof the given information\n (Rescher and Manor 1970).\n For instance, where \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(s\\) are logical atoms and\n\\(\\Gamma = \\{ p \\wedge q, \\neg p \\wedge q, s\\}\\), maximal consistent\nsubsets of \\(\\Gamma\\) are \\(\\Gamma_1 = \\{p \\wedge q, s\\}\\) and\n\\(\\Gamma_2 = \\{\\neg p \\wedge q, s\\}\\). Various consequence relations\nhave been defined on the basis of consistent subsets. We give two\nexamples (see\n Benferhat et al. (1997)\n for more). \n\nLet \\(\\Sigma\\) be a possibly inconsistent set of formulas and let\n\\(\\mathrm{MCS}(\\Sigma)\\) be the set of maximal consistent subsets of\n\\(\\Sigma\\). The set \\(\\mathrm{Free}(\\Sigma)\\) of innocent\nbystanders in \\(\\Sigma\\) is obtained by intersecting all members\nof \\(\\mathrm{MCS}(\\Sigma)\\). \n\n Free consequences. \\(\\phi\\) is a free consequence of\n\\(\\Sigma\\), denoted by \\(\\Sigma \\nc_{\\mathrm{free}} \\phi\\), if and\nonly if it is (classically) entailed by the set of all the innocent\nbystanders \\(\\mathrm{Free}(\\Sigma)\\). \n Inevitable consequence. \\(\\phi\\) is an inevitable\nconsequence of \\(\\Sigma\\), denoted by \\(\\Sigma \\nc_{\\mathrm{ie}}\n\\phi\\), if and only if it is (classically) entailed by each member of\n\\(\\mathrm{MCS}(\\Sigma)\\). \n\n\nIn our example, the innocent bystander \\(s\\) is both a free and\ninevitable consequence, while \\(q\\) is merely an inevitable\nconsequence. In order to highlight the defeasible character of this\ntype of reasoning, consider the situation in which we obtain\nadditionally the information \\(\\neg s\\). We now have the additional\ntwo maximal consistent subsets \\(\\Gamma_{3} = \\{p \\wedge q, \\neg s\\}\\)\nand \\(\\Gamma_{4} = \\{p \\wedge \\neg q, \\neg s\\}\\) in view of which\n\\(s\\) is neither a free nor an inevitable consequence. E.g., although\n\\(\\Gamma \\nc_{\\mathrm{free}} s\\) we have \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\neg s\\}\n\\nnc_{\\mathrm{free}} s\\). \n\nThis kind of dynamics is characteristic for non-monotonic logics, in\nfact it is the reason for their name. They violate the Monotony\nproperty which holds for deductive reasoning, for instance, for the\nrelation of logical consequence \\(\\vDash\\) of CL (see the entry on\n classical logic\n for details on the relation \\(\\vDash\\)): \n\nMonotony: If \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\phi\\) then also \\(\\Sigma \\cup\n\\Sigma' \\nc \\phi\\). \n\n\nMonotony states that consequences are robust under the addition of\ninformation: if \\(\\phi\\) is a consequence of \\(\\Sigma\\) then it is\nalso a consequence of any set containing \\(\\Sigma\\) as a subset. Most\nof scholarly attention has been paid to the type of dynamics\nunderlying defeasible reasoning that results in violations of Montony\ndue to the retraction of inferences in view of conflicting new\ninformation. It has been called the synchronic\n (Pollock 2008)\n or the external dynamics\n (Batens 2004)\n of defeasible reasoning. \n\nClearly, most forms of defeasible reasoning are externally dynamic and\nhence most logics for defeasible reasoning violate Monotony: they have\nnon-monotonic consequence relations for which consequences may not\npersist when new information is obtained. This feature is so central\nthat the formal logical study of defeasible reasoning is often taken\nto be coextensive with the domain of NML where non-monotonicity is\nunderstood as a property of the consequence relation of a logic. \n\nIt has been noted, that beside the external there is also a\ndiachronic\n (Pollock 2008)\n or internal dynamics\n (Batens 2004)\n underlying defeasible reasoning. It is the result of retracting\ninferences without having available new information in terms of new\npremises: by analyzing the already available information we may find\n(possibly unexpected) inconsistencies. \n\nLet us return to non-monotonicity as a property of the consequence\nrelation. Given that Monotony is abandoned in NMLs, we are naturally\nled to the question which formal properties are to replace Monotony\nand whether some weakened forms of robustness of the consequence set\nunder the addition of new information is also to be expected in the\nrealm of defeasible reasoning. We state here two of the most central\nproperties considered in the literature: \n\nCautious Monotony: If \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\psi\\) and \\(\\Sigma \\nc\n\\phi\\), then also \\(\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\phi\\} \\nc \\psi\\). \nRational Monotony: If \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\psi\\) and \\(\\Sigma \\nnc\n\\neg \\phi\\), then also \\(\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\phi\\} \\nc \\psi\\). \n\n\nBoth Cautious and Rational Monotony are special cases of Monotony, and\nare therefore not in the foreground as long as we restrict ourselves\nto the classical consequence relation \\(\\vDash\\) of CL. \n\nCautious Monotony is the converse of Cut: \n\nCut: If \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\phi\\) and \\(\\Sigma \\cup \\{\\phi\\} \\nc\n\\psi\\), then \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\psi\\). \n\n\nCautious Montony (resp. Cut) states that adding a consequence \\(\\phi\\)\nto the premise-set \\(\\Sigma\\) does not lead to any decrease\n(resp. increase) in inferential power. Taken together these\nprinciples express that inference is a cumulative enterprise: we can\nkeep drawing consequences that can in turn be used as additional\npremises, without affecting the set of conclusions. In\n Gabbay (1985)\n it has been shown that some basic and intuitive assumptions about\nnon-monotonic derivations give rise to consequence relations which\nsatisfy Cautious Monotony, Cut and Reflexivity (If \\(\\phi \\in \\Sigma\\)\nthen \\(\\Sigma \\nc \\phi\\)). Accordingly, these properties are commonly\ntaken to be central principles of\n NML.[1]\n\n\nRational Monotony states that no conclusions of \\(\\Sigma\\) are lost\nwhen adding formulas \\(\\phi\\) to \\(\\Sigma\\) that are not contradicted\nby \\(\\Sigma\\). Rational Monotony is a more controversial property than\nCautious Monotony. For instance,\n Stalnaker (1994)\n gave a counter-example to it (see the\n supplementary document)\n in view of which it is clear that not in all application contexts\nRational Monotony is a desirable property of defeasible reasoning.\n\n",
