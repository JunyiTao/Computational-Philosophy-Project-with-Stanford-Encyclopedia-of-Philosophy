    "main_text": "Daoist Medical Traditions and Physicians || Tao Hongjing\n3.2 Tao Hongjing\n\n\nTao Hongjing\u9676\u5f18\u666f (456\u2013536) was the effective\nfounder of Shangqing \u4e0a\u6e05 (Highest Clarity) Daoism. He held\nseveral court positions under the Liu Song and Qi dynasties. In\n492 he retired to Mount Mao (Maoshan \u8305\u5c71), where he became\ninterested in the so-called Shangqing revelations to Yang Xi a\ncentury before his time. He set himself to collect and edit\nthe original manuscripts connected with these revelations. The\nresult was the Declarations of the Perfected (Zhen\ngao \u771f\u8aa5). When the Liang dynasty came to power\nin 502, he joined the court of Emperor Wu (r. 502\u2013549), on whom he had\nconsiderable influence.\n\n\nTao was educated in Daoist traditions associated with the Daode\njing, Zhuangzi, and the works of Ge Hong; and was initiated in the\nLinbao school at the age of thirty. He was also actively engaged\nin mostly unsuccessful attempts to produce alchemical elixirs\n(Strickman 1979, 152). \n\n\nTao\u2019s father and grandfather were experts in medicinal drugs, and he\nshared their interests in materia medica and medicine. Shortly\nafter compiling the Zhen gao he wrote a major work of\npharmacology: the Collected Commentaries to the Canonical\nPharmacopoeia (Bencao jing jizhu\n\u672c\u8349\u7d93\u96c6\u6ce8), a commentary and re-edition\nof the Shen Nong bencao, a Han work of pharmacology attributed\nto Shen Nong, the legendary inventor of materia medica. Tao\ndoubled the account of 365 drugs in the original and also rearranged\nthe material (502\u2013557), (Predagio 2013, 968\u201371; Robinet 1993;\nStrickman 1979).\n\n\nTao Hongjing is thus another clear case of overlapping interests\nbetween philosophy and medicine. His interests clearly included\nDaoist philosophy and practice, medicine, pharmacology and alchemy.\n",
