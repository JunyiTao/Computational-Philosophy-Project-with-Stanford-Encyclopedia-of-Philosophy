    "main_text": "Logic and the Hebrew language\n4. Logic and the Hebrew language\n\nKaspi was deeply concerned with the status of the Hebrew language.\nWhile agreeing with Aristotle that languages are conventional rather\nthan natural, he places Hebrew on a higher level, arguing that its\ncombinations of letters into words are not accidental. A Hebrew word\ndenotes the qualities of the object designated, and there is a\none-to-one relation between words and their\ndesignata. According to Kaspi, Hebrew is the ideal\nlanguage because its nouns attest to their characteristics,\nwhether essential or incidental. Man is called adam in\nHebrew because he originates [partly] from the earth (Hebrew:\nadama); ish because he originates partly\nfrom fire (Hebrew: esh) and enosh because of\nhis worthless and expendable nature (the Hebrew root\na-n-sh, claims Kaspi, designates\ndestruction and loss; Retuqot Kesef, p. 44).\n\nGeneralization is another critical principle derived from logic in\nKaspi\u2019s conception of language. Logic rests partly on the\ndivision between the general and the specific. Genus is defined as the\nmost general and comprehensive set of all. A species constitutes a\nsubset of a genus with a specific difference, but its particulars also\npossess non-essential properties. According to this principle,\nclaims Kaspi, a speaker is not obligated to reveal all particulars in\nhis choice of words. He thereby blurs boundaries in both language\nmorphology (such as differences in gender, number and time) and\nsyntax. Kaspi maintains that the grammatical means a speaker adopts to\nexpress these differences constitute superfluous information.\nConsequently, nothing is peculiar about a text that uses the male\ninstead of the female gender and so on. \u201cIt is not obligatory to\ninsist on gender consistency. A masculine name may well be accompanied\nby a feminine adjective or verb and vice versa. We have been fortunate\nto find textual gender consistency in a few places, but we should not\nfind it unusual if it is lacking in others\u201d (Retuqot\nKesef, p. 15). In a similar vein, Kaspi writes about texts that\nuse the singular instead of the plural, past tense instead of the\nfuture, or texts that lack the concept of a sentence or other\nsyntactic structures.\n",
