    "main_text": "Quaker thought and practice\n2. Quaker thought and practice\n\n\nFell\u2019s views about female spiritual authority are best\nunderstood in the context of her wider religious beliefs. Above all,\nFell embraces the Quaker notion that every human being has the\n\u201cLight of Christ\u201d within them and that this light is the\nSecond Coming of Christ in the flesh (cf. Bruyneel 2010, 6\u20137;\nBruyneel 2015, 107\u20138; Donawerth and Lush 2018,\n11\u201313). According to the Quaker philosophy, all human beings are\ncapable of attaining salvation provided that they turn their minds to\nthe divine light. This universalism concerning salvation, and the\nQuaker view that everyone is capable of discerning fundamental\nreligious truths for themselves, had notable implications for early\nQuaker practice. The Quakers believe that Christ is equally manifest\nin everyone and that God is \u201cno respecter of persons\u201d\n(Acts 10:34). From early on, the Quakers enacted this belief by taking\na collaborative approach to prayer meetings. They did not appoint a\nsingle authoritarian preacher, \u201cset up to teach them, it may be\nthirty or forty years together\u201d (Fell 1667b, 86), but rather\nmembers would wait in silence till someone felt the light stir\nwithin. A guiding principle, Fell says, was that no-one should\n\u201cstrive for Mastery\u201d but everyone should \u201cesteem\nothers better than themselves\u201d (Fell 1710, 55). In their\nday-to-day interactions with social superiors, Quaker men would not\nremove their hats, and Quaker women would not curtsey. They refused to\ntake oaths (such as the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy) and they\ndid not use deferential titles. This lack of outward submission led\nsome critics to accuse Quakers of \u201clevelling all\nconditions\u201d and ignoring social hierarchies between magistrates\nand people, husbands and wives, and masters and servants (Collier\n1657, 12).\n\n\nDespite her anti-authoritarian beliefs, however, Fell was no\nadvocate of active resistance to political authority. She was, in fact,\none of the first writers to articulate the Quaker philosophy of peace\nand non-resistance. In a letter to Charles II, dated 1660, she declares\nthat the Quakers aspire\n\n\n\nto live peaceably with all men, And not to Act any thing against the\nKing nor the peace of the Nation, by any plotts, contrivances,\ninsurrections, or carnall weapons to hurt or destroy either him or the\nNation thereby, but to be obedient unto all just & lawfull\nCommands. (Glines 2003, 280)\n\n\n\nFell emphasizes that although Friends cannot in good conscience take\nan oath, \u201cin Substance they perform that, which is true\nAllegiance to the King\u201d (Fell 1710, 29\u201330). They express their\nallegiance by opposition to resistance and through denial of the\nPope\u2019s authority (Fell 1710, 31). In none of her works does Fell\ncall for the subject\u2019s right to rebel against tyrannical or\nirreligious political leaders.\n\n\nIn the early years of the movement, Quakers also dressed plainly and\nwithout ostentation. This practice was an outcome of focusing on the\n\u201cInner-Man\u201d rather than outer appearances (Fell 1660f, 20).\nIn one of her last \u201cEpistle to Friends\u201d (1698), Fell\nsternly warns against the dangers of leading young Friends into\n\u201cthe observation of outward things\u201d. The outward form does\nnot make a true Christian, but rather the inner person:\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Spirit,\u201d she says, \u201cthat gives\nLife\u201d (Fell 1710, 535).\n",
