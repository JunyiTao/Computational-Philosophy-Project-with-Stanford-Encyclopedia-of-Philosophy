    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Mathematical Construction\n5.4 Mathematical Construction\n\nThere has been extensive discussion of the non-conceptuality of\nintuition in the secondary literature on Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics. For example, Michael Friedman has argued that the\nexpressive limitations of the prevailing logic in Kant\u2019s time\nrequired the postulation of intuition as a form of singular,\nnon-conceptual representation (Friedman 1992: ch. 2). Charles Parsons\n(1964, 1992a) and Emily Carson (1997, 1999) have argued that space\nmust be given in a phenomenological manner as an original,\nnon-conceptual representation in order that we be able to demonstrate\nthe real possibility of constructed mathematical objects as required\nfor geometric knowledge (cf. Shabel 2010: 100\u2013102). All of this\nat least suggests that Kant\u2019s conception of mathematical\nconstruction includes an important nonconceptual element.\n\nUltimately, however, there are difficulties in assessing whether\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics can be decisive for the debate\nconcerning the dependence of intuition on the intellect. One issue is\nthat the sense in which intuition must be nonconceptual in accounting\nfor mathematical knowledge is not obviously incompatible with claiming\nthat intuitions themselves (including pure intuition; see\n \u00a75.6\n below) are dependent upon a conceptually guided synthesis (e.g., Land\n2014). A second issue is that one might agree that intuitions are in\nsome sense \u201cnonconceptual\u201d while holding that the pure\nforms of intuition (as discussed in the relevant Metaphysical\nExpositions in the Transcendental Aesthetic) are themselves generated\nby a non- or pre-conceptual synthesis by the intellect, or the\nimagination as a function thereof (e.g., Waxman 1991; Longuenesse\n1998: ch. 8; Friedman 2012, 2015, 2019). Such views are forms of\nIntellectualism even if they reject the claim that intuition, in\nmaking synthetic a priori knowledge in mathematics possible, possesses\nconceptual content or is otherwise conceptually dependent.\n\nHence, the sense in which the dependence relation alluded to by Kant\nin claiming that mathematical principles are \u201cderived\nfrom\u201d (A160/B199) pure intuition is one that seems open to both\nIntellectualist and Sensibilist interpretations (cf. Shabel 2017).\nThus it is unclear whether mathematical considerations could be\ndecisive in adjudicating the debate between Intellectualism and\nSensibilism.\n",
