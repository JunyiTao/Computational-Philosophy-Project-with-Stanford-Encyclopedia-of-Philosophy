    "main_text": "Discourse Ethics || Discourse\n3.1 Discourse\n\nDiscourse is not a synonym for language or speech. Only speech that is\nexplicitly oriented towards reaching rationally motivated consensus\ncounts as discourse (1981 [1984a: 42]). In other words, discourse is\ncommunication, for Habermas stipulates that communication just is\nspeech oriented towards reaching understanding. But discourse is\ncommunication of a special kind. When communication breaks down and\nthe everyday shared meanings and understandings that normally\ncoordinate interactions are disrupted, interlocutors have to switch\nfrom action to discourse. Discourses are a \u201creflective form of\nagreement-oriented action that \u2026sit on top of the latter\u201d\n(1986a [1990b: 245\u20136]). Discourse is a higher order of\ncommunication, with the aim of renewing or replacing a problematized\nconsensus. To participate in discourse just is to provide reasons with\nthe aim of convincing all interlocutors to accept a disputed validity\nclaim. So, on Habermas\u2019s view, discourse just is the language\ngame of argumentation in which disputed validity claims are\n\u201credeemed\u201d, and when a validity claim is redeemed\nsuccessfully the disrupted consensus is restored, renewed, or replaced\nby a new one.\n\nOn this picture, argumentation is a rule-governed practice, not a\nverbal free-for-all. Habermas identifies three levels of rules. First,\nthere are the basic rules of logic such as the principle of\ncontradiction, and the basic semantic rules of universalizability and\nconsistency (1983 [1990: 86]). Second, there are procedural norms such\nas the principles of sincerity and accountability, namely that every\nparticipant must undertake, if only implicitly, to assert only what\nshe genuinely believes and always either to justify upon request what\nshe asserts or to provide reasons for not offering a justification.\nThese are, contends Habermas, preconditions for all genuine\nargumentation, i.e., argumentation conceived as a \u201csearch for\ntruth\u201d and organized like \u201ca competition for better\narguments\u201d (1983 [1990: 87\u20138]). Third, there are the\nprocessual preconditions that immunize discourse against coercion,\nrepression, and inequality. These norms are supposed to insulate\ndiscourse from all persuasive forces except the \u201cunforced force\nof the better argument\u201d, and they must be followed, if a\nrationally motivated consensus is to be reached.\n\nHabermas suggests that the following rules of discourse can be\nestablished:\n\n(1)\nEvery subject with the competence to speak and act is allowed to\ntake part in a discourse.\n(2)\n\n\na.\nEveryone is allowed to question any assertion whatever.\nb.\nEveryone is allowed to introduce any assertion whatever into the\ndiscourse.\nc.\nEveryone is allowed to express his attitudes, desires, and\nneeds.\n \n(3)\nNo speaker may be prevented, by internal or external coercion,\nfrom exercising his rights as laid down in (1) and (2) (1983 [1990:\n89]; Rehg 1994: 62).\n\n\nThe above list is not intended to be complete. And Habermas nowhere\nprovides a complete list. They are a representative sample borrowed\nfrom Robert Alexy\u2019s Theory of Practical Discourse\n(Alexy 1978 [1990: 165\u20137]).\n",
