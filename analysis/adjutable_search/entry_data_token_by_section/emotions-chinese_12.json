In his The Passions of the Soul\n(Les Passions de l\u2019\u00e2me), Descartes (1649)\ndesignates six primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy,\nand sadness. Except wonder, one can see his primitive passions in\nearly Chinese texts. Ekman\u2019s (1999) list of the basic emotions\n(emotions that are universally perceived and recognized across\ncultures and societies, i.e., joy, anger, sadness, fear, disgust,\nsurprise) also overlap substantially with those of early Chinese\nphilosophers. Although the notion of qing is quite\nidiosyncratic and polysemous, the individuation of emotions in early\nChinese philosophy seems comparable to that of Western philosophy and\npsychology.\n",
