    "main_text": "Logical Consequence\n7. Logical Consequence\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s most sophisticated definition of\nsyllogism is at [Expressions] 100.3\u20135: a syllogism\nis\n\n\nthings that are arranged in the mind in an order\n(tart\u012bb) such that when the things have been put in this\norder, the mind as a result finds itself unavoidably looking down at\nsomething else of which it was ignorant before, so that it knows it\nnow, and thus the mind is equipped to submit to the thing it looked\ndown at, just as if it [already] knew that thing.\n\n\nThe reference to \u201corder\u201d must owe something to\nAristotle\u2019s remark at Topics 156a22\u201326 that in a\ndebate, the questioner can sometimes hoodwink the responder by asking\nthe questions in the wrong order. But by bringing the notion of order\ninto the definition of syllogism itself, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nopens up a new chapter in logic (see Hodges 2018 on this and\nAvicenna\u2019s development of the theme). \n\nFor further illumination on al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nunderstanding of logical consequence, we need to explore what he says\nabout logical rules. At [Catalogue] 53.5\u20139 he tells\nus:\n\n\nThe art of logic provides in general the rules whose nature is to\nconstitute the intellect and to guide a person along the correct and\ntrue path in everything where there can be conceptual error, and the\nrules that protect and guard him against mistakes and slips and errors\nin concepts, and the rules through which one tests things in concepts\nwhere one can\u2019t be trusted not to make an error. \n\n\nBut these are Neoplatonic\n commonplaces.[22]\n Elsewhere al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b says deeper things about the rules\nof logic, as follows. \n\nRecall from\n Section 3\n above that on al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s understanding, the\ncorrect methods of logic were known by the time of Plato, who had them\n\u201caccording to matter\u201d, and it was Aristotle who\nreformulated them as \u201cuniversal rules\u201d. He very probably\nhas the same thing in mind when he says that Aristotle in Prior\nAnalytics considered declarative sentences \u201cfrom the point\nof view of their composition (ta\u2019l\u012bf) and not of\ntheir matter\u201d ([Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n53.3f). The point he is making here becomes clear if we go back to the\nexample syllogism spelled out at\n (*) in Section 5 above.\n This is actually al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s second shot at this\nsyllogistic mood. In his first shot ([Syllogism] 26.11f) he\nfollowed Aristotle\u2019s preferred style and used letters A,\nB, C in place of the \u201cmatters\u201d stone,\nanimal, and body respectively. So a corresponding paraphrase will\nread\n\n(**)\nFor all primary concepts A, B, and C, if a\nfirst sentence is taken as universal negative with subject A\nand predicate B, etc. etc.\n\n\nHere (**) is a universal rule in the sense that it is for all\nA, B, and C; the premises and conclusion contain\nno matter and are bare compositions. \n\nMallet (1994: 329\u2013335) calls attention to a passage in\n[Analysis] 95.5\u20138, where al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b says\nhe will explain \u201chow we define syllogism\u201d and how it is\nused. \n\n\nFirstly, it is through knowledge of the topics, which are the\nuniversal premises whose particulars (juz\u2019iyy\u0101t)\nare used as major premises in a syllogism and in each separate art.\n\n\n\nIf \u201cparticulars\u201d means what it usually means in such a\ncontext, namely existentially quantified statements, then this is just\nwrong: existentially quantified statements are hardly ever major\npremises in syllogisms. But as Mallet points out, the passage makes\nsense if the \u201cuniversal premises\u201d are statements like (**)\nand their \u201cparticulars\u201d are corresponding statements of\nthe form\n (*).\n Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b is then saying that natural language\nsyllogisms are validated through being instances of universal rules\nstating that all arguments of a certain form are valid. If this is a\ncorrect reading, it makes al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b a formal logician\nin a strong sense. And indeed some writers have written about\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s \u201cformalism\u201d (Zimmermann\n1981: xl).\n\nHowever, there are reasons for caution. As Mallet\u2019s paper shows,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b in his further discussion of topics, both in\n[Analysis] and in [Debate], heads off in completely\ndifferent directions (which are too complex to pursue here, but see\nHasnawi 2009 and Karimullah 2014). Moreover al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nhas a habit of justifying inferences by reference to real-world\ninformation about their terms (i.e., their matter) that is not\ncontained in the premises. He does this with the syllogistic mood\nBaroco ([Syllogism] 27.8\u201312, [Short\nSyllogism] 79.5\u201312), and there is a one-premise example at\n[Commentary on De Interpretatione]\n 136.10.[23]\n Elsewhere he plays fast and loose with the \u201cforms\u201d of\narguments, for example reducing a many-premise version of induction to\na two-premise categorical syllogism without giving any indication of\nhow a string of premises are reduced to a single one\n([Syllogism] 35.14\u201318). \n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b often refers to \u201cuniversal\nrules\u201d. But they need not be laws that can be shown to hold\nwithout exceptions. Take for example his essay [Canons],\nwhich closes (272.16) with a statement that the work has presented\n\u201cuniversal rules\u201d of poetry. The work consists mostly of\nclassifications of different types of poetry, together with\ndefinitions of terms used in analyzing poetry, and a broad comparison\nwith decorative arts. These \u201crules\u201d are at best things\nthat a person who aspires to work on the theory of poetry ought to\nknow.\n\nIn any case the only kind of justification that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b offers for logical rules is that they have\nbeen found useful for certain purposes in the community that uses them\n(cf.\n Section 3 above).\n All in all, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b treats the formal rules of logic\nas heuristics rather than as laws of a scientific theory. A case can\nbe made for viewing al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b as one of the creators of\nwhat is now known as \u201cinformal logic\u201d, as in the texts of\nHitchcock (2017) and Walton (1989). The pivotal role that he gives to\ndialogue places him in the same world as Walton\u2019s book.\n",
