    "main_text": "The Definition of Morality\n6. The Definition of Morality\n\nThe argument set out in the previous section suggests that\n\u201cmoral judgment\u201d can be viewed as a psychological natural\nkind term, and the essential features of moral judgments are that the\nperson making them takes them to be authority independent and\ngeneralizable to other times and other places. On the view urged by\nPutnam, Devitt, and Kornblith, these three features enable us to\nprovide a scientifically justified definition of \u201cmoral\njudgment\u201d. But while Turiel and his collaborators employ these\nfeatures as \u201ccriterion judgments\u201d used to determine\nwhether a participant\u2019s normative judgment is a moral judgment,\nthey do not treat them as providing a definition of\n\u201cmoral judgment\u201d. This is not because the social domain\ntheorists are uninterested in definitions. Quite the opposite! Many of\ntheir publications include discussions of \u201cthe definition of\nmorality\u201d (or of \u201cthe moral domain\u201d). Those\ndiscussions often acknowledge the influence of philosophical accounts\nof morality, and some of them discuss philosophical literature in\nconsiderable detail. Indeed, according to Turiel and Davidson,\n\n\nmore than any other discipline, philosophy has provided a basis for\ndefinitional criteria \u2026, [and] the working definitions guiding\nour research on concepts of convention and moral judgments \u2026\nborrowed liberally from some of those philosophical\ntreatments\u2026. (1986: 118)\n\n\nHowever, these definitions of morality, which have evolved somewhat\nover time, can be rather puzzling. It is often less than clear what\nthe definitions are, what their status is, how they are to be\nevaluated, and what role they play in the research of social domain\ntheorists. What is clear is that the definitions have provoked a great\ndeal of controversy. Some of the most trenchant and empirically\nsophisticated critiques of Turiel\u2019s work have focused on his\ndefinitions of morality. The primary goal of this section is to offer\nan account of the ways in which claims about the definition of\nmorality interact with other aspects of the work of Turiel and his\ncolleagues. The two sections that follow will consider some of the\nmore influential critiques of Turiel\u2019s definition.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few examples. In Turiel (1977: 80) we are\ntold: \u201cThe distinction between convention and morality implies a\nnarrow definition of morality as justice\u201d. Much the same idea\nappears in Nucci and Turiel (1978). After maintaining that\n\u201csocial conventions are defined relative to the social\ncontext\u201d, they go on to say that \u201cmoral issues are\n\u2026 structured by underlying concepts of justice\u201d (1978:\n400\u2013401). But later in that paper, they describe their study in\nwhich \u201cevents classified as moral involved the justice, welfare,\nor rights of individuals or groups\u201d (1978: 402). This\nanticipates the formulation used in a frequently quoted passage at the\nbeginning of Turiel\u2019s The Development of Social\nKnowledge (1983), where we\u2019re told that\n\n\nthe moral domain refers to prescriptive judgments of justice, rights\nand welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other.\n(1983:\n 3)[13]\n\n\nSocial domain theorists often characterize diminishing someone\u2019s\n\u201cwelfare\u201d as causing \u201charm\u201d, and in many\nplaces the term \u201charm\u201d replaces \u201cwelfare\u201d in\ntheir\n definition.[14]\n This is particularly important because in the vast majority of\nstudies by Turiel and other social domain theorists the transgressions\nthat they take to be moral result in obvious harm to the victim, and\nas we\u2019ll see in the following sections, the role of harm in\ncharacterizing moral transgressions has become a central focus in the\nliterature. In some recent publications by social domain theorists,\nfairness and equality have been added to the\n definition.[15]\n\nWhat is the status of these evolving definitions? One obvious proposal\nis that they are simply terminological stipulations intended\nto inform the reader about how these authors have decided to use the\nterm \u201cmorality\u201d. But that\u2019s clearly not what\u2019s\nintended, since Shweder, Turiel, and Much (1981: 289) insist that\n\u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018morality\u2019 is something\ndiscovered, not stipulated\u201d. Another possibility is that the\ndefinitions are attempts to capture the ordinary meaning of the term\nas it is used by speakers of contemporary English. But that proposal\nis also clearly mistaken. \u201cThe terminology\u201d, Turiel tells\nus,\n\n\ndoes not necessarily correspond to general, nonsocial scientific usage\nof the labels \u201cconvention\u201d and \u201cmorality\u201d.\nClear or systematic patterns of general use of the labels would be\ndifficult to discern. As labels, the terms are often used\ninterchangeably or even inconsistently; sometimes they correspond to\nthe definitions provided here and sometimes they are inconsistent with\nthem. (Turiel 1983: 34)\n\n\nIn trying to understand the status of these definitions, one useful\nhint is that Turiel and his associates often talk about\nimproving or refining them (see, for example, Killen\n& Smetana 2008: 4). In Turiel, Killen, and Helwig (1987: 169)\nwe\u2019re told that\n\n\n[t]he general strategy has been a recursive one: using definitions of\ndomain to inform data-gathering procedures and data to inform the\ndescriptions insofar as they apply to individuals\u2019 judgments. As\nstressed elsewhere (Turiel & Davidson 1986), these procedures must\nbe regarded as efforts based on working hypotheses, since the range\nand boundaries of domains are still not precise. The working\ndefinitions for the domains have also been partly guided by\nphilosophical treatments\u2026.\n\n\nAnd in Turiel and Davidson (1986), the strategy is further elaborated\nas follows:\n\n\nThe formation of systems for classifying domains of knowledge is both\na definition and a research issue in that definitions and data\ninterpretations feed back on each other. Our strategy has been one of\nmoving from (a) initial domain identification and definitional\ncriteria\u2026, to (b) the gathering of data bearing on how subjects\nuse and distinguish the categories, to (c) reformulations of the\ncategories and criteria\u2014and so on. (1986: 114)\n\n\nThese passages suggest the following account of the role and\njustification of definitions of morality in the work of Turiel and his\ncollaborators, and of the way philosophy contributed to their project.\nAs noted in\n Section 3,\n the philosophical literature played a role in designing the initial\nexperiments that enabled Turiel to show that children distinguish\ndifferent sorts of normative transgressions and thus that their\nnormative judgments are not \u201cundifferentiated\u201d. The\nfeatures probed by criterion judgment questions\u2014authority\nindependence and generalization to other places and other\ntimes\u2014were suggested by the philosophical literature. Having\nshown that a modest number of schoolyard transgressions that seem,\nintuitively, to be moral evoke the (putatively) moral pattern of\ncriterion judgments, a natural question to ask was how to characterize\nthe full set of transgressions that would evoke moral criterion\njudgments. Characterizing that set of transgressions would constitute\na \u201cdefinition of morality\u201d. Here again philosophy played a\nrole by suggesting what Turiel, Killen, and Helwig (1987) characterize\nas their \u201cworking definitions\u201d of the moral domain. Using\nsuch a working definition, Turiel and his colleagues could fine tune\nthe transgression descriptions and criterion judgment questions used\nin their experiments. And sometimes the results of the experiments\nrequired modification of the working definition of morality, which\nexpanded from matters involving justice, to justice,\nrights, and welfare or harm, and then expanded again to include\nmatters involving fairness and equality. This back\nand forth between definitions and data-gathering procedures is the\n\u201crecursive\u201d strategy that Turiel, Killen, and Helwig\n(1987) were alluding to.\n",
