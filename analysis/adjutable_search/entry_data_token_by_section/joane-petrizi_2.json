    "main_text": "Philosophy\n3. Historical Reception and Influence\n\nJoane Petrizi is the most widely read Georgian philosopher.\nPetrizi\u2019s Proclus Commentary with his Georgian\ntranslation of the Elementatio theologica had a major\ninfluence not only on Georgian philosophy and culture, but also\noutside of Georgia. In 1248, the Armenian monk Svimeon translated\nPetrizi\u2019s Proclus work into Armenian, thus contributing to the\ndissemination of the philosophy of Proclus there. In the\n17th century, Armenian philosophers devoted intensive work\nto Proclus\u2019s thought, to which they attributed contemporary\nrelevance; in 1651, the Armenian bishop Svimeon Dshughaezi wrote\ncommentaries to facilitate the understanding of the Elementatio\ntheologica. The basis for his commentary was the\n13th-century Armenian translation by the monk Svimeon of\nPetrizi\u2019s Georgian translation.\n\nIn 1757, these commentaries, together with the Armenian version of the\nElementatio theologica, were translated into Georgian; they\nhave made a clear mark on Georgian culture. Thus, in the\n18th century there were at least two different commentaries\non the Elementatio theologica in Georgian.\n\nIt must be emphasized that the thinkers of the Georgian Enlightenment\nin the 17th and 18th centuries reacted to these\ntraditions in diverse ways. Some trenchantly criticized the Armenian\nversion with reference to its contents (see below on Anton\nBagrationi). But one point is certain: in the modern era in Georgia,\nProclus\u2019s philosophy was the subject of intensive consideration\nand interest by virtue of Petrizi\u2019s works.\n\nLet us here have a look at three important stages of the Georgian\nreception of Proclus and Petrizi.\n\n(1) Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani (1658\u20131726) integrates numerous\ntheorems from Petrizi\u2019s Proclus work into his Georgian\nDictionary. In the definition and discussion of the problem of\nknowledge, he refers to the 20th proposition of the\nInterpretation and determines reason as the simple, bodiless\nknowledge of the known (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 166, col. 1\u20132).\nOther important philosophical definitions\u2014for example the\ndetermination of real being (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 574, col. 1), of\nproduction (Orbeliani, vol. II, p. 366, col. 2; p. 367, col. 1), of\ncausality (Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 480, col. 1\u20132), of motion\n(Orbeliani, vol. I, p. 479, col. 2)\u2014are taken from\nPetrizi\u2019s Proclus Commentary. In his Georgian\nDictionary, Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani made equally intensive\nreference to Petrizi\u2019s Georgian translation of the work On\nthe Nature of Man by Nemesius of Emesa.\n\n(2) In his philosophical work Spekali (1752), the philosopher\nand theologian Anton Bagrationi (1720\u20131788) refers to\nPetrizi\u2019s Interpretation, adopting numerous theorems of\nneo-Platonic origin from him. Anton Bagrationi took some chapters\ndevoted to Proclus\u2019s problem of knowledge almost verbatim from\nPetrizi\u2019s work (Anton I., Spekali, pp.\n327\u2013331).\n\nThe last chapters of Spekali are devoted to Petrizi. In\nchapters 148 and 149, Anton Bagrationi treats the topic of knowledge\non the basis of the propositions on nous in the\nInterpretation. Following Petrizi, it is here claimed that\nreasoned knowledge is different from the soul\u2019s mode of\nknowledge. In its essence, the activity and the substance of reason\nare a unity, whereas the nature of the soul shows itself to\nbe differentiated. The essence and the activity of the soul can be\ndistinguished inasmuch as knowledge is not the primary\nquality of the soul. In its knowledge, the soul proceeds from one\nbeing to another, that is, the acquired insights are deemed to be the\nbases for the progress of knowledge. The knowledge of reason\nhas to be characterized differently, for its activity is grounded in\neternal knowing and can be seen as nothing other than this\nactivity. At this point it must be remarked that Anton Bagrationi made\nintensive use of the noetic terminology of Petrizi\u2019s\nProclus Commentary to characterize his concept of knowledge.\nHis significant philosophical determinations of noetics were worked\nout exclusively with reference to Petrizi.\n\nAnton Bagrationi was trenchantly critical of the Armenian version of\nthe Elementatio theologica inasmuch as it did not represent\nProclus\u2019s or Petrizi\u2019s genuine doctrine. In his work\nTheology, of which a critical edition has not yet been\npublished, he claims that true metaphysics was there combined with\nfalse theories and thus disfigured. In his opinion, the old version\n(that is, Petrizi\u2019s version) of the Elementatio\ntheologica should be studied rather than the new (Armenian)\nversion. Admittedly, he sided with Petrizi in this point:\nPetrizi\u2019s interpretation of Proclus\u2019s philosophy should be\naccepted rather than its arbitrary transformation by modern Armenian\nand Georgian interpreters.\n\n(3) In contrast to Anton Bagrationi, Joane Bagrationi\n(1768\u20131830) mainly relied on the Armenian commentaries on the\nElementatio theologica in his main work, Kalmasoba,\nwhich is written in dialogue form. In the determination of the One and\nits dialectics, he quotes the first chapters of Proclus\u2019s work.\nFurthermore, the chapters on nous (for example prop. 20) are\ngiven adequate consideration in Kalmasoba. In this work,\nJoane Bagrationi does not comment on all the chapters of the\nElementatio theologica; a total of 86 chapters were commented\non. It is remarkable that the author interprets or transforms some\npassages of Proclus\u2019s and Petrizi\u2019s work in an original\nmanner; in the discussion of the problem of cause, he begins by\ndistinguishing three main kinds\u2014God, nature and skill\u2014and\nemphasizes God\u2019s superiority to all other causes. Joane\nBagrationi made use of Svimeon Dshughaezi\u2019s commentaries,\nattempting to interpret Proclus and Petrizi with their help.\nFurthermore, Joane Bagrationi brought clarity to the noetics of the\nElementatio theologica, characterizing the various kinds and\nfunctions of knowledge and designating the knowing soul as specific to\nman.\n\nAlthough Joane Petrizi\u2019s work received increasing attention in\nthe course of time and Georgian thinkers always emphasized his\nintellectual heritage, a thorough-going scholarly treatment of\nPetrizi\u2019s works only really began in the 20th\ncentury. Without a doubt, the most important stage in Petrizi research\nis represented by the publication of a scholarly edition of\nPetrizi\u2019s philosophical works. The edition began in 1937 with\nthe publication of the second volume of Petrizi\u2019s Proclus\nwork\u2014the Intertpretation of the \u201cElementatio\ntheologica\u201d of Proclus. This volume was edited by Sh.\nNutsubidze and S. Kaukhchishvili; it includes a comprehensive and\nvaluable study of Petrizi\u2019s philosophy in which the teaching of\nthe Georgian philosopher is viewed as reflected by his contemporaries\nand analysed with reference to Byzantine and Georgian medieval\nthought.\n\nThe first volume of Petrizi\u2019s Proclus work (The Elementatio\ntheologica of the Platonic Philosopher Proclus) was published in\n1940. This volume contains the Georgian translation of the\nElementatio theologica from the Greek. The editor was S.\nKaukhchishvili; M. Gogiberidze wrote an introduction to the volume. It\nalso contains a comprehensive vocabulary for both volumes, also\ncompiled by S. Kaukhchishvili. In the 20th century,\nPetrizi\u2019s Interpretation was translated into Russian.\nThe Russian translation of 1984 with an introduction and annotations\nby G. Tevzadze is of particular importance. After the publication of\nscholarly editions of Petrizi\u2019s works, both philosophical and\nphilological problems of the Proclus commentary have been subject to\nthorough-going research (for a detailed account of the state of\nPetrizi research, cf. Iremadze 2004a, 13\u201327).\n",
