    "main_text": "The Epistemological Role of Intuitions || General Intuitions\n2.3 General Intuitions\n\nThe four examples above\n (\u00a72.2)\n involve appeal to intuitions regarding particular hypothetical cases\nin philosophical theorizing. There are, however, other prominent\nexamples of appeals to intuition, such as those of the epistemological\nrationalist. For present purposes, the epistemological rationalist is\none who holds that belief in some propositions is not justified by\nsense experience, introspection, or memory, but rather by rational\nintuition (BonJour 1998; Bealer 1998).\n\nOne traditional argument for rationalism appeals to various\npropositions which (a) we seem clearly justified in believing, and (b)\nseem justified not by experience, but rather simply by our seeming to\nsee or apprehend that they are true. Plausible candidates include\nprinciples of classical logic, basic arithmetic, analytic\npropositions, color or shape exclusion principles, and transitivity\nclaims. The following examples are representative:\n\n[R1] Nothing can be red\nand green all over at the same time.\n[R2] \\(2 + 2 =\n4\\)\n[R3] If A is\ntaller than B and B is taller than C, then\nA is taller than C.\n[R4] There are no round\nsquares.\n[R5] (P and\nQ) implies Q.\n\n\nThe hypothetical case examples which drive much philosophical\ntheorizing in epistemology, moral theory, metaphysics, and the\nphilosophy of mind are, in some sense, particular in content. The\nrationalist\u2019s examples are typically more general.\n\nIn fact, there are philosophically significant propositions at all\nlevels of generality which may be the content of intuitions. Here are\nsome examples of general propositions which have been alleged to be\nintuitive:\n\n[G1] If S is\njustified in believing p and justified in believing \\(\\Box(p\n\\supset q)\\), then S is justified in believing\nq.\n[G2] If X is a\nheap of sand, then X remains a heap even if one grain of sand is\nremoved.\n[G3] S performs\nact A freely only if S could have done\notherwise.\n[G4] For every property\nP, there is a set of individuals (perhaps empty) which possess\nP.\n[G5] Through a given\npoint not on a given line, there exists exactly one line parallel to\nthe given line.\n[G6] Whether a later\nperson, y, is numerically identical to an earlier person,\nx, can depend only on intrinsic facts about x and\ny and the relations between x and\ny.\n[G7] Any two possible\nactions exactly alike in all non-moral respects must be exactly alike\nin all moral respects.\n\n",
