Background to the KS Theorem\n\n\nIn the following, we will presuppose some familiarity with elementary\nQM notions like \u2018state\u2019, \u2018observable\u2019,\n\u2018value\u2019 and their mathematical representatives\n\u2018vector\u2019, \u2018(self-adjoint) operator\u2019 and\n\u2018eigenvalue\u2019 [see the entry on\n quantum mechanics\n for details]. We will usually identify the observables and the operators\non an appropriate Hilbert space which represent them; if there is a\nneed to distinguish operators and observables, we write the operators\nunderlined and in boldface. (Thus an operator\nA represents an observable A.)\n\n\nThe present section states some elements of the historical and\nsystematic background of the KS theorem. Most importantly, an argument\nby von Neumann (1932), a theorem by Gleason (1957), and a critical\ndiscussion of both plus a later argument by Bell (1966) have to be\nconsidered. Von Neumann, in his famous 1932 book Die mathematischen\nGrundlagen der Quantenmechanik, disputed the possibility of\nproviding QM with an HV underpinning. He gave an argument that boils\ndown to the following: Consider the mathematical fact that, if\nA and B are\nself-adjoint operators, then any real linear combination of them (any\nC = \n \u03b1A +\n \u03b2B, where\n \u03b1,\n \u03b2 are arbitrary real\nnumbers) is also a self-adjoint operator. QM further dictates that:\n\nIf A and B (represented by self-adjoint operators\nA and B) are\nobservables on a system, then there is an observable C\n(represented by self-adjoint operator C defined\nas before) on the same system. \nIf, for any QM state, the expectation values of A\nand B are given by <A> and <B>,\nthen the expectation value of C is given by\n<C>=\u03b1<A> +\n\u03b2<B>.\n\n\n\nNow consider A, B, C, as above, and assume\nthey have definite values v(A),\nv(B), v(C). Consider a\n\u2018hidden state\u2019 V which determines\nv(A), v(B),\nv(C). We can then derive from V trivial\n\u2018expectation values\u2019 which are just the possessed values\nthemselves: <A>V =\nv(A), and so\n on.[2]\n Of course, these \u2018expectation values\u2019 do not, in general,\nequal the QM ones: <A>V \u2260\n<A> (we would indeed think of the latter as averages\nover the former for different hidden states V!). However, von\nNeumann requires that the <A>V,\nlike the <A>, conform to (2). This automatically\nentails that the values themselves must conform to a condition\nparallel to (2), i.e.:\n\nv(C) = \u03b1v(A) +\n\u03b2v(B).\n\n\n\nThis, however, is impossible, in general. An example very easily\nshows how (3) is violated, but because of its simplicity it also\nshows the argument\u2019s inadequacy. (This example is not due to von\nNeumann himself, but to\n Bell![3]) \n Let A = \u03c3x and B =\n\u03c3y, then operator C = (\u03c3x +\n\u03c3y)/\u221a2 corresponds to the observable of the\nspin component along the direction bisecting x and\ny. Now all spin components have (in suitable units) possible\nvalues \u00b11 only, thus, the HV proponent is forced to ascribe\n\u00b11 to A, B, C as values, and thus as\n\u2018expectation values\u2019. But (3) now obviously cannot be\nfulfilled, since \u00b11 \u2260 (\u00b11 + \u00b11)/\u221a2.\n\n\nThe example illustrates why von Neumann\u2019s argument is\nunsatisfying. Nobody disputes the move from (2) to (3) for compatible\nobservables, i.e. those which, according to QM, are jointly measurable\nin one arrangement. The above choice of A, B,\nC, however, is such that any two of them are incompatible,\ni.e. are not jointly observable. For these we will not want to require\nany HV interpretation to meet (3), but only (2). The hidden values\nneed not conform with (3) in general, only the averages of their\nvalues in a series of tests must conform with (2). The authority of\nvon Neumann\u2019s argument comes from the fact that requirements (1) and\n(2), for QM states, are consequences of the QM formalism, but\nthis does not in itself justify extending these requirements to the\nhypothetical hidden states. Indeed, if (3) were\nunrestrictedly true, this would nicely explain, in the presence of\nhidden values, why (2) is. Von Neumann apparently thought that the HV\nproponent is committed to this explanation, but this seems an\nimplausible restriction.\n\n\nThe KS theorem remedies this defect, and thus strengthens the case\nagainst HV theories insofar as it assumes (3) only for sets of\nobservables {A, B,\nC} which are all mutually compatible. The theorem requires\nthat only for compatible observables assumption (3) must hold.\n\n\nA second, independent line of thought leading to the KS theorem is\nprovided by Gleason\u2019s theorem (Gleason 1957). The theorem states that\non a Hilbert space of dimension greater than or equal to 3, the only\npossible probability measures are the measures\n\u03bc(P\u03b1) = Tr(P\u03b1\nW), where P\u03b1 is a projection\noperator, W is the statistical operator characterizing the\nsystem\u2019s actual state and Tr is the trace \n operation.[4]\n The P\u03b1 can be understood as representing\nyes-no observables, i.e. questions for whether a QM system\n\u2018living\u2019 in such a Hilbert space has a property \u03b1 or\nnot, and every possible property \u03b1 is associated uniquely with a\nvector |\u03b1> in the space \u2014 so, the task is to\nunambiguously assign probabilities to all vectors in the space. Now,\nthe QM measure \u03bc is continuous, so Gleason\u2019s theorem in effect\nproves that every probability assignment to all the possible\nproperties in a three-dimensional Hilbert space must be\ncontinuous, i.e. must map all vectors in the space continuously\ninto the interval [0, 1]. On the other hand, an HV theory (if\ncharacterized by VD + NC) would imply that of every property we can\nsay whether the system has it or not. This yields a trivial\nprobability function which maps all the P\u03b1\nto either 1 or 0, and, provided that values 1 and 0 both occur (which\nfollows trivially from interpreting the numbers as probabilities),\nthis function must clearly be discontinuous (cf. Redhead 1987:\n28).\nThe proof of Gleason\u2019s theorem is notoriously intricate.  It is\nnotable, however, that this corollary of Gleason\u2019s theorem can be\nobtained more directly via means much more elementary than those\nemployed in Gleason\u2019s proof.  Bell (1982: 994, 1987: 164) credits\nJ. M. Jauch with drawing his attention (in 1963) to Gleason\u2019s theorem,\nand with pointing out that it implies the strengthening of von\nNeumann\u2019s result, with the additivity requirement only for commuting\nobservables.  Bell then went on to prove the result in an elementary\nway, without use of Gleason\u2019s proof (Bell 1966).  Unknown to Bell,\nSpecker had already arrived at this result, alluded to (but not\npresented) in Specker (1960), as ein elementargeometrisches\nArgument.[5]\nThe argument was presented in Kochen and Specker (1967).  Bell\u2019s proof\nand the Kochen-Specker proof utilize similar constructions in\n3-dimensional Hilbert space, though they differ in their details.\nKochen and Specker go on to explicitly construct a finite set of\nprojections that cannot be assigned values subject to the constraint\nthat the additivity requirement (3) hold when A\nand B commute.  Though Bell does not do so, one can readily\nobtain from Bell\u2019s construction also a finite set of observables that\ncannot be assigned values subject to the additivity constraint for\ncommuting observables (see Mermin 1993).\n\n\nAfter having offered his variant of the argument against HV theories\nfrom Gleason\u2019s theorem, Bell proceeds to criticise it. His\nstrategy parallels the one against von Neumann. Bell points\nout that his own Gleason-type argument against arbitrary closeness of\ntwo opposite-valued points presupposes non-trivial relations between\nvalues of non-commuting observables, which are only justified given\nan assumption of noncontextuality (NC). He proposes as an analysis of\nwhat went wrong that his own argument \u201ctacitly assumed that\nmeasurement of an observable must yield the same value independently\nof what other measurements may be made simultaneously\u201d (1966: 9). In\nopposition to von Neumann, the Gleason-type argument derives\nrestrictions on value assignments like (3) only for sets of\ncompatible observables; but still one and the same observable can be\na member of different commuting sets, and it is essential to the\narguments that the observable gets assigned the same value in both\nsets, i.e. that the value assignment is not sensitive to a context.\n",
