    "main_text": "Causal Modeling || Conclusion and Further Reading\n3.7 Conclusion and Further Reading\n\nCausal modeling is a burgeoning area of research. This entry has largely\nignored work on computational methods, as well as applications of the\ntools discussed here. Rather, the focus has been on the conceptual\nunderpinnings of recent programs in causal modeling, with special\nattention to the connection between causation and probability. It has\nalso focused on what it possible to learn about causation \u201cin\nprinciple\u201d on the basis of probabilities, while ignoring the\npractical problems of making causal inferences on the basis of finite\ndata samples (which inevitably deviate from the true\nprobabilities).\n\nThe entry on Causal Models covers all of the material in this section\nin greater detail. The most important works surveyed in this section\nare Pearl 2009 and Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000. Pearl 2010\nis a short overview of Pearl\u2019s program, and Pearl et al. 2016 is\na longer overview. The latter, in particular, assumes relatively\nlittle technical background. Scheines 1997 and the Introduction of\nGlymour & Cooper 1999 are accessible introductions to the SGS\nprogram. Neapolitan 2004 is a text book that treats Bayes nets in\ncausal and noncausal contexts. Neapolitan & Jiang 2016 is a short\noverview of this topic. Hausman 1999, Glymour 2009, Hitchcock 2009,\nand Eberhardt 2017 are short overviews that cover some of the topics\nraised in this section. The entry on\n causation and manipulability\n contains extensive discussion of interventions, and some discussion\nof causal models. \n",
