    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || The Mathematical Objection\n2.3 The Mathematical Objection\n\nSome people have supposed that certain fundamental results in\nmathematical logic that were discovered during the 1930s\u2014by\nG\u00f6del (first incompleteness theorem) and Turing (the halting\nproblem)\u2014have important consequences for questions about digital\ncomputation and intelligent thought. (See, for example, Lucas (1961)\nand Penrose (1989); see, too, Hodges (1983:414) who mentions\nPolanyi\u2019s discussions with Turing on this matter.) Essentially,\nthese results show that within a formal system that is strong enough,\nthere are a class of true statements that can be expressed but not\nproven within the system (see the entry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems).\n Let us say that such a system is \u201csubject to the Lucas-Penrose\nconstraint\u201d because it is constrained from being able to prove a\nclass of true statements expressible within the system.\n\nTuring (1950:444) himself observes that these results from\nmathematical logic might have implications for the Turing test:\n\nThere are certain things that [any digital computer] cannot do. If it\nis rigged up to give answers to questions as in the imitation game,\nthere will be some questions to which it will either give a wrong\nanswer, or fail to give an answer at all however much time is allowed\nfor a reply. (444)\n\n\nSo, in the context of the Turing test, \u201cbeing subject to the\nLucas-Penrose constraint\u201d implies the existence of a class of\n\u201cunanswerable\u201d questions. However Turing noted that in the\ncontext of the Turing test, these \u201cunanswerable\u201d questions\nare only a concern if humans can answer them. His \u201cshort\u201d\nreply was that it is not clear that humans are free from such a\nconstraint themselves. Turing then goes on to add that he does not\nthink that the argument can be dismissed \u201cquite so\nlightly.\u201d\n\nTo make the argument more precise, we can write it as follows:\n\nLet C be a digital computer.\nSince C is subject to the Lucas-Penrose constraint, there is an\n\u201cunanswerable\u201d question q for C.\nIf an entity, E, is not subject to the Lucas-Penrose constraint,\nthen there are no \u201cunanswerable\u201d questions for E.\nThe human intellect is not subject to the Lucas-Penrose\nconstraint.\nThus, there are no \u201cunanswerable\u201d questions for the\nhuman intellect.\nThe question q is therefore \u201canswerable\u201d to the human\nintellect.\nBy asking question q, a human could determine if the responder is\na computer or a human.\nThus C may fail the Turing test.\n\n\nOnce the argument is laid out as above, it becomes clear that premise\n(3) should be challenged. Putting that aside, we note that one\ninterpretation of Turing\u2019s \u201cshort\u201d reply is that\nclaim (4) is merely asserted\u2014without any kind of proof. The\n\u201cshort\u201d reply then leads us to examine whether humans are\nfree from the Lucas-Penrose constraint.\n\nIf humans are subject to the Lucas-Penrose constraint then the\nconstraint does not provide any basis for distinguishing humans from\ndigital computers. If humans are free from the Lucas-Penrose\nconstraint, then (granting premise 3) it follows that digital\ncomputers may fail the Turing test and thus, it seems, cannot\nthink.\n\nHowever, there remains a question as to whether being free from the\nconstraint is necessary for the capacity to think. It may be that the\nTuring test is too strict. Since, by hypothesis, we are free from the\nLucas-Penrose constraint, we are, in some sense, too good at asking\nand answering questions. Suppose there is a thinking entity that is\nsubject to the Lucas-Penrose constraint. By an argument analogous to\nthe one above, it can fail the Turing test. Thus, an entity which can\nthink would fail the Turing test.\n\nWe can respond to this concern by noting that the construction of\nquestions suggested by the results from mathematical\nlogic\u2014G\u00f6del, Turing, etc.\u2014are extremely complicated,\nand require extremely detailed information about the language and\ninternal programming of the digital computer (which, of course, is not\navailable to the interrogators in the Imitation Game). At the very\nleast, much more argument is required to overthrow the view that the\nTuring Test could remain a very high quality statistical test for the\npresence of mind and intelligence even if digital computers differ\nfrom human beings in being subject to the Lucas-Penrose constraint.\n(See Bowie 1982, Dietrich 1994, Feferman 1996, Abramson 2008, and\nSection 6.3 of the entry on\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems,\n for further discussion.)\n",
