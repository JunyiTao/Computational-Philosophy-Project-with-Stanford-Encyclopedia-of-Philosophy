    "main_text": "Imitation\n2. Imitation\n\n\u201cImitation\u201d is the commonest English translation of\nmim\u00easis. Alternatives include\n\u201crepresentation\u201d and \u201cemulation.\u201d To make\nthings confusing, the transliterated Greek word sans diacritical mark\nhas come to be accepted as English (\u201cmimesis\u201d). All the\ntranslations capture something of the word\u2019s meaning. As long as\n\u201cimitation\u201d is used with awareness that it will not mean\neverything that mim\u00easis does, it makes a serviceable\ntranslation. \u201cImitate\u201d functions well enough as the verb\nmimeisthai; so does \u201cmimic.\u201d (See S\u00f6rbom\n1966; also see Maru\u0161i\u010d 2011.)\n\nOf course one can use the Greek mim\u00easis, as this\ndiscussion will frequently do. For simplicity\u2019s sake some prefer the\nnow-English \u201cmimesis.\u201d But this last choice brings a risk.\nThe English word \u201cmimesis\u201d has begun picking up its own\ncontexts and connotations, becoming English proportionately as it\nceases to substitute for the Greek word.\n\nBesides mim\u00easis Plato sometimes speaks of a\nmim\u00eama. \u201cImitation\u201d like\nmim\u00easis can refer either to a process or to its\noutcome. You engage in the act of imitation in order to produce an\nimitation. A mim\u00eama however is only ever a copy, not\nalso the copying act that produced it.\n\n(Mateo Duque was of much help in thinking through issues in the coming\nsections.)\n",
