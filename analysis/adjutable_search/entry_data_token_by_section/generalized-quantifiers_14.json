    "main_text": "Constancy\n15. Constancy\n\nIsom, i.e., topic neutrality, is standardly\nseen as at least a necessary condition for being a logical\n constant.[30]\n It is possible to distinguish logicality from\nconstancy in the earlier mentioned sense of meaning the same\nover different universes. For one thing, logicality is a property that\nought to be closed under definability, whereas it is not at\nall clear that constancy should be similarly closed. Note, for\nexample, that the class of Ext quantifiers is\nnot closed under first-order definability. More precisely, it is\nclosed under the usual Boolean operations, but not under inner\nnegation and hence not under taking duals, where the\ninner negation of a type \\({\\langle}1{\\rangle}\\) quantifier Q\nis defined by \\((Q\\neg)_M(A) \\Leftrightarrow Q_M(M\\!-\\!A)\\), and the\ndual by \\(Q^d = \\neg(Q\\neg)\\). For example, \\(\\exists^d =\n\\forall\\).\n\nOne intuition might be that Ext suffices for\nconstancy. But a different intuition is that a quantifier meaning the\nsame on all universes in particular should satisfy Isom,\nwhich forces Q to be the\n\u201csame\u201d on all universes of the same cardinality. These two\nideas are incompatible, since together they would imply that Ext\nimplies Isom, which is\nmanifestly false. Clearly, the vague notion of meaning the same across\ndifferent universes admits of different precisifications. On closer\ninspection, it seems unlikely that there is one precise version that\nwould accommodate all intuitions about sameness.\n\nIn this situation, a suggestion would be to simply stipulate that\nconstancy amounts to Ext + Isom.\nThis would be a Carnapian explication of\nconstancy. Quantifiers with this combination of properties seem\ncertain to mean the same on all universes. On the other hand, Ext\nbut non-Isom quantifiers\nlike three\\(^{\\textit{student}}\\) or some\nprofessor\u2019s would not have the same meaning across\ndifferent domains, which as we saw accords with one intuition.\nFurthermore, the few natural non-Ext\nquantifiers we have encountered are all definable from Ext\n+ Isom\n quantifiers.[31]\n\n",
