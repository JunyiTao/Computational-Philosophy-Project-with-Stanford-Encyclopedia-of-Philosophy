What sort of claim is this? Well, it\nseems clear what sort of claim it isn\u2019t. It isn\u2019t an\nidentity claim. For example, the property of striking isn\u2019t\nidentical to the property of picketing, as there are different ways of\nstriking, such as carefully following all safety regulations so as to\nimpede productivity. It isn\u2019t a causal claim either, at least if\nby causation we mean what we normally mean when we use the\nterm. The causes of the strike concern not the picketing of the\ntruckers but, instead, antecedent events such as how their employer\nhas allotted payroll deductions and benefits. Finally, the claim\nisn\u2019t purely modal in character either\u2014it isn\u2019t\nmerely the claim that there is a necessary connection between\npicketing and striking. Perhaps this behavior together with the\nsatisfaction of other conditions suffices for there to be a labor\nstrike, but the former suffices for any number of things, such as the\nfact that \\(2+2=4\\).\n\nWhat sort of claim is it, then? Some suggest that this and similar\nclaims are grounding claims, where grounding is understood to\nbe a form of constitutive (as opposed to causal or probabilistic)\ndetermination or explanation. The point of departure for theorizing\nabout grounding is that there are a variety of claims\u2014claims we\nmake in ordinary life as well as ones we make in the context of doing\nphilosophy\u2014that are best interpreted as being claims about what\ngrounds what. As for metaphysics in particular, some claim that\ngrounding plays a central role in the enterprise properly conceived.\nSchaffer, for example, writes that \u201cmetaphysics as I understand\nit is about what grounds what\u201d rather than what exists (2009:\n379). And, according to Fine, questions about what grounds what are\ncentral to what he calls realist metaphysics, which concerns\nnot just the nature of things but whether they are real;\n\u201cIndeed\u201d, Fine writes, \u201cif considerations of ground\nwere abolished, then very little of the subject would remain\u201d\n(2012a: 41).\n\nWe begin by addressing some preliminary issues, including how best to\nformulate grounding claims. Then we address the following general\nquestions: What is the nature of grounding? Why think that there is\ngrounding in the first place? And how does grounding interact with\nother notions of philosophical interest, such as necessity?\n", "toc": [{"#Prel": "1.

Preliminaries\n\nIn this section we address five preliminary issues: the distinction\nbetween determination- and explanation-based conceptions of grounding,\nthe formulation of grounding claims, the distinction between full and\npartial grounding, cases that are thought to illustrate the general\nconcept of grounding, and historical discussions of grounding.\n1.1 Determination and explanation\n\nAn important initial choice point in theorizing about grounding\nconcerns the theses of unionism and separatism\n(Raven 2015: 326). Proponents of unionism work with an\nexplanation-based conception of grounding, stipulating that grounding\nis a form of explanation, what we will call\nexplanationG (Dasgupta 2017; Fine 2012a;\nLitland 2015; Rosen 2010). For unionists, to say that the bowl\u2019s\nbrittleness is grounded in the ionic bonds of its constituent atoms\nis, in the first instance, to say that the bowl is brittle because\nthese bonds are ionic, that it\u2019s brittle in virtue of the ionic\nbonding, or that the brittleness is accounted for by the bonding.\n\nSeparatists, on the other hand, work with a determination-based\nconception of grounding. The guiding idea here is an analogy between\ncausation and grounding. Causation, while itself a form of\ndetermination rather than explanation, nevertheless backs\nexplanations. So too separatists claim with grounding: grounding,\nrather than being a form of explanation, is a form of\ndetermination\u2014what we will call\ndeterminationG\u2014that backs\nexplanations (Audi 2012a; Schaffer 2009, 2012, 2016a; Trogdon 2013a).\nFor separatists, to say that the bowl\u2019s brittleness is grounded\nin the ionic bonds of its constituent atoms is, in the first instance,\nto say that these bonds non-causally generate, produce, or bring about\nthe bowl\u2019s brittleness. Just what the intuitive notion of\nbacking ultimately comes to in the context of causation and grounding\nisn\u2019t an entirely settled matter\u2014some understand backing\nin terms of representation (Trogdon 2018a), while others suggest that\nbacking itself is to be given a grounding-theoretic treatment (Kovacs\n2020; Wirling 2020). (The\n\u201cexplanationG\u201d and\n\u201cdeterminationG\u201d terminology is\nborrowed from Skiles and Trogdon (2021)).\n\nUnionists, as we understand them, are committed to there being\ninstances of a certain form of explanation and to providing an account\nof what it\u2019s like; they don\u2019t have a corresponding\ncommitment regarding any form of determination. For separatists, the\nreverse is the case. Hence, unionism and separatism are importantly\ndifferent theses (cf. Dasgupta 2017: fn. 8; Kovacs 2020). And note\nthat, even if we agree that there is both\nexplanationG and\ndeterminationG, there still may be substantive\nreasons to go with one view rather than the other. For example, if,\nsay, explanationG is conceptually prior to\ndeterminationG, then perhaps we should, all other\nthings being equal, interpret grounding claims as targeting in the\nfirst instance the former rather than the latter. Compare: Strevens\n(2008: Ch. 6) claims that we ought to interpret causal claims (e.g.,\n\u201cThe stone striking the glass caused the window to\nshatter\u201d) as targeting in the first instance causal explanation\nrather than causation understood as a form of determination, as the\nformer is conceptually prior to the latter.\n1.2 Regimentation\n\nTo regiment grounding discourse is to adopt a formal language in which\nwe can precisely formulate grounding claims. A regimentation includes\nvarious linguistic policies, including ones specifying which syntactic\nforms we should use to express grounding relationships. There are two\ngeneral approaches to regimentation. On the first approach,\nregimentation is chiefly pragmatic in nature. In this case, we might\nregiment in one way rather than another merely because doing so will,\nsay, make a certain complicated argument or idea easier to follow or\nunderstand. On the second approach, our choices concerning\nregimentation are guided by the goal of accurately describing the\nstructure of reality.\n\nAs for the regimentations themselves, two general frameworks have\nemerged: predicationists formulate grounding claims with a\nrelational predicate, one corresponding to the English predicate\ngrounds (Audi 2012a; Schaffer 2009; Rosen 2010).\nConnectivists use a non-truth-functional sentential\nconnective instead, one corresponding to the English operator\nbecause (Fine 2012a; Correia 2010; Schneider 2011). Full\nblown connective regimentations will include a logic of grounding,\nwhich on Fine\u2019s (2012a, 2012b) development includes structural\nrules and properties (e.g., transitivity) and logical rules including\nintroduction and elimination rules. (See Poggiolesi 2020 for a general\ndiscussion of the logic of grounding.) Note that each of these\napproaches to regimentation is compatible with both separatism and\nunionism (Kovacs 2018: note 28). For further context, note that there\nis corresponding discussion regarding the proper formulation of\ntruthmaking claims (Melia 2005).\n\nSome claim that a potentially relevant consideration here concerns\nontological commitment (Correia 2010). All other things being equal,\nif one way of formulating grounding claims has fewer ontological\ncommitments than another, then the former is preferable to the latter.\nSuppose that the connectivist\u2019s connective is understood to be\nnon-committal, so as not to commit us to a grounding operation. And\nsuppose that the predicationist\u2019s predicate is understood to\ncommit us to a grounding relation between facts. In this case, it may\nbe that connectivism has an advantage over predicationism\u2014this\ndepends on whether there are countervailing considerations (e.g., the\nconnective treatment may be relatively cumbersome to work with). But\nnote that the predicationist, of course, might claim that their\npredicate is non-committal (nominalists, for example, dispute that\nrelational terms commit us to properties and relations), and perhaps\nthere are reasons to think that the connectivist\u2019s connective\ncommits us to a grounding operation. The moral is that we need to\nestablish which terms are committal before any claims of minimizing\ncommitment can be made. (Also, note that, with respect to the\npotential commitments of predicationism, we may have different\nattitudes about relations and facts\u2014you might be happy to\ncountenance facts but not relations or vice versa.)\n\nWhile we will introduce some symbols for expressing facts below, we\nwon\u2019t adopt any particular formal language for expressing\ngrounding relationships, so we needn\u2019t adopt either\npredicationism or connectivism. For ease of presentation, however, we\nwill formulate grounding claims with the predicate grounds\nand speak as if this predicate expresses a relation\u2014the\ngrounding relation\u2014such that collections of one or more facts\nground particular facts. (See, however, Dasgupta 2014b and Litland\n2018a for bicollective conceptions of grounding according to which\ncollections of facts can be non-distributivity grounded.) Where\nP is an English sentence, let \\([P]\\) be a function from\nP to the fact it corresponds to. So [Gomer is a good dog] is\nthe fact that Gomer is a good dog. (We will also indicate propositions\nin the same manner using angle rather than square brackets.) We assume\nthat grounding is factive in the following sense: \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\) only if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 and\n\\([Q]\\) obtain. Much of what we go on to say can be captured without\nrecourse to relations and facts, but we won\u2019t attempt to provide\nsuch translations.\n\nBefore proceeding, we should note that some formulate grounding claims\nin such a way that all manner of things potentially ground one\nanother, not just facts (Cameron 2008; Schaffer 2009; Wilhelm 2020).\nThe theses of separatism and unionism are relevant here (see\n \u00a71.1).\n Given unionism (grounding is explanationG), the\nrestriction to facts seems quite reasonable. While it makes sense to\nsay, for example, that [The truck exists] explains something,\nit\u2019s unclear what it might mean to say that the truck itself\ndoes so (Raven 2015; Trogdon 2013a). But, given separatism (grounding\nis determinationG), the alternative view is a\ngenuine option. We can coherently maintain that the truck determines\nits particular redness (a mode), and this, in turn, backs an\nexplanation of the existence of the mode in terms of the existence of\nthe truck.\n\nMoreover, some treat grounding as a quaternary rather than binary\nrelation. One such view is that the grounding relation includes two\nslots for facts and two slots for modes of presentation of those facts\n(Jenkins 2011). Another such view is that grounding is contrastive in\nnature, so it includes two slots for facts and two slots for contrasts\nof those facts (Schaffer 2012). Consider, again, the claim that [The\ntruckers are picketing] grounds [The truckers are striking]. Depending\non the context, we might read the claim as follows: [The truckers are\npicketing] rather than [They\u2019re working as normal] grounds [The\ntruckers are striking] rather than [It\u2019s not the case that\nthey\u2019re striking]. Schaffer argues that his version of the\nquaternary view is preferable to the binary view insofar as we can\nreasonably maintain that grounding is transitive given the former but\nnot the latter (see\n \u00a72.3\n for further discussion of transitivity). Schaffer also suggests that\nthe contrastive treatment of grounding is plausible insofar as it\ncasts grounding in an apt form to back explanation, which is itself\ncontrastive in nature.\n1.3 Full and partial grounding\n\nThere is a distinction between full and partial grounding. Suppose\n\\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). Speaking in unionist\nterms, for a preliminary characterization of the distinction we can\nsay that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 partially grounds \\([Q]\\) when\nthe former facts contribute to explaining the latter; and \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 fully grounds \\([Q]\\) when nothing needs to be\nadded to the former to get a fully adequate explanation of the latter\nfact. Separatists might instead initially characterize the distinction\nin terms of partial and full determination.\n\nSticking with unionism for the moment, we can say that, as any ground\ncontributes to explaining what it grounds, any ground is a partial\nground. But not all partial grounds provide fully adequate\nexplanations of what they ground, so not all partial grounds are full\ngrounds. A merely partial ground is a partial ground that isn\u2019t\na full ground. By grounding we henceforth mean partial\ngrounding. The example of the truckers picketing above illustrates the\nnotion of merely partial grounding\u2014we would need to add facts\nabout the trucking company and relations between the picketers and the\ncompany (e.g., that the picketers work as drivers for the company) to\nget a fully adequate explanation of the fact that they\u2019re\nstriking. As for full grounding, a common view is that conjunctive\nfacts are fully grounded by their conjuncts\u2014the collection\nconsisting of [The bowl is brittle] and [The truckers are striking],\nfor example, is thought to fully ground [The bowl is brittle and the\ntruckers are striking].\n\nAccording to the standard definition of partial grounding, \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 partially grounds \\([Q]\\) just in case \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 either on its own or together with other facts\nfully grounds \\([Q]\\) (Audi 2012a; Litland 2015; Loss 2017; Raven\n2013; Rosen 2010; Skiles 2015). You might initially view this\ndefinition as being a purely stipulative matter. But it\u2019s\nactually substantive in nature, as we have a pre-theoretic grip on\nboth partial and full grounding. In fact, Leuenberger (2020) and\nTrogdon & Witmer (2021) argue that the standard definition is\nfalse, proposing cases in which mere partial grounds can\u2019t be\nsupplemented with further facts to yield full grounds. The latter\nrecommend reversing the direction of the standard definition,\nproposing a definition of full grounding in terms of partial grounding\ntogether with other notions.\n1.4 Illustrative cases\n\nSo far, we have considered four grounding claims, namely:\n\n[The truckers are picketing] grounds [The truckers are\nstriking].\n[The truck exists] grounds [Thus-and-so particular redness\nexists].\n[The bowl\u2019s constituent atoms are bonded in thus-and-so way]\ngrounds [The bowl is brittle].\n[The bowl is brittle], [The truckers are striking] grounds [The\nbowl is brittle and the truckers are striking].\n\n\nNow, you might think there is something to grounding, yet at the same\ntime, think that these claims aren\u2019t true. As for the second and\nfourth examples above, perhaps there are no modes or conjunctive\nfacts. But these are illustrative cases\u2014these claims, whether\ntrue or not, help communicate the relevant notion of grounding and\nthus contribute to fixing the topic of discussion. Let\u2019s try to\nget a better sense of what the range of illustrative cases looks\nlike.\n\nWhile there are perhaps different ways of usefully typing illustrative\ncases, here we focus on three categories. Importantly, this taxonomy\nisn\u2019t intended to be exhaustive, and it may be that these\ncategories aren\u2019t exclusive either. First, there are\nmetaphysical cases, cases in which entities that \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 concern are metaphysically linked with entities\n\\([Q]\\) concerns. Our initial example of the truckers picketing is\nsuch a case. In this case, [The truckers are picketing] concerns the\nproperty of picketing, and the [The truckers are striking] concerns\nthe property of striking. Plausibly, the property of striking is a\nfunctional property (a property whose nature is exhausted by its\ncausal role), one functionally realized by the property of picketing\non this occasion (as opposed to, say, the property of engaging in a\nwork slowdown). The brittleness and mode examples look like\nmetaphysical cases as well, where mereological realization and mode\ndetermination yoke the relevant entities in these cases, respectively.\nFor other cases of this type, consider the following sentences, where\n\"{Beijing}\" refers to the set whose sole member is Beijing,\nand <The truck is red> refers to the proposition that the truck\nis red:\n\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing} exists].\n[The grains of sand exist] grounds [The heap of sand exists].\n[The truck is red] grounds [<The truck is red> is\ntrue].\n\n\nPlausibly, Beijing stands in the set formation relation to {Beijing},\nthe grains of sand compose the heap, and the truck is a truthmaker for\n<The truck is red> (i.e., the former makes the latter true).\n\nSecond, there are logical cases, grounding claims that\ncorrespond to certain logical inference rules, particularly\nintroduction rules (cf. McSweeney 2020 and Merlo 2020). Just which\nintroduction rules are relevant here will depend, in part, upon\nwhether grounding is worldly in nature (see\n \u00a72.1\n for discussion). The conjunctive case concerning the bowl being\nbrittle and the truckers striking above is such a case, which of\ncourse corresponds to conjunction introduction. For other examples,\nconsider the following two cases, which correspond to disjunction and\nexistential introduction, respectively:\n\n[The truck is red] grounds [The truck is red or the bowl is\nbrittle].\n[The truck is red] grounds [Something is red].\n\n\nThird, there are conceptual cases, grounding claims that\ncorrespond to certain conceptually necessary conditionals (cf.\nSmithson 2020). For example, you might think that it\u2019s\nconceptually necessary that if the truck is burgundy then the truck is\nred. The corresponding grounding claim:\n\n[The truck is burgundy] grounds [The truck is red].\n\n\nFor further examples of this type, consider:\n\n[Trucks are essentially artifacts] grounds [It\u2019s necessary\nthat any truck is an artifact].\n[The figure is a rectangle with sides of equal length] grounds\n[The figure is a square].\n\n\nThe thought is that it\u2019s conceptually necessary that if trucks\nare essentially artifacts, then it\u2019s necessary that any truck is\nan artifact; and it\u2019s conceptually necessary that if the figure\nis a rectangle with sides of equal length, then the figure is a\nsquare.\n\nAs mentioned above, these categories are aren\u2019t intended to be\nexclusive or exhaustive. With respective to exclusivity, the example\nof the burgundy truck above is perhaps both conceptual and\nmetaphysical, as burgundy and red stand in the\ndeterminate-determinable relation, a relation that plausibly\nunderwrites metaphysical links between properties.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve focused on specific grounding claims (i.e., claims\nto the effect that this collection of facts grounds that fact), but\nvarious generic grounding claims are illustrative cases as well. There\nare illustrative generic grounding claims corresponding to the\nspecific grounding claims discussed above, such as:\n\nFacts concerning the instantiation of determinate properties\nground facts concerning the instantiation of determinable\nproperties.\n\n\nHere\u2019s another example, one not connected to any specific\ngrounding claim we have discussed so far:\n\nChemical facts ground biological facts.\n\n\nThis last example speaks to the idea that grounding relations between\ndifferent kinds of facts are that in virtue of which the world has a\nlayered structure (see\n \u00a73.2\n for related discussion).\n1.5 Historical connections\n\nThere are interesting and difficult questions about grounding, its\nhistory, and what its relationship to the history of philosophy is. On\none view, the notion of grounding is old, perhaps as old as philosophy\nitself, with many of its most important thinkers engaging with\nquestions related to grounding. On another view, the notion of\ngrounding is decidedly new\u2014it\u2019s a recent development in\ncontemporary analytic metaphysics.\n\nCan we reconcile the grounding-is-old and grounding-is-new views? The\ndistinction between questions of grounding and questions\nabout grounding is helpful here (Raven 2019). To take but one\nwell-worn example, when Socrates asks in the Euthyphro if\nsomeone is pious because they are loved by the gods, or if they are\nloved by the gods because they are pious, perhaps Plato is directing\nour attention to a question of grounding. When in the contemporary\nliterature, philosophers are debating about whether grounding is, say,\na strict order (see\n \u00a72.3),\n this is the result of their asking questions about grounding.\nHistorically, so the thinking goes, philosophers have been interested\nin questions of grounding, whereas the contemporary literature has\nbeen primarily focused on questions about grounding. There is a sense,\nthen, in which the notion of grounding is as old as the hills, with\nthe more recent focus in the literature being directed at the notion\nitself.\n\nAlthough this characterization is appealing, it has its limitations.\nClearly, contemporary philosophers are interested in questions of\ngrounding in addition to questions about grounding. What might be less\nclear, however, is that, on the face it, the historical literature is\nby no means short of attempts at engaging with questions about\ngrounding in addition to questions of grounding. Consider, for\nexample, cosmological arguments. In broad strokes, the thought is that\nthe totality of contingent entities, the cosmos, stands in need of\nexplanation, and only considerations involving God understood as a\nnecessary existent are up to the task. Central to such arguments is an\nassumption according to which we can\u2019t explain why there are\ncontingent entities by appealing to the existence of a contingent\nentity. Debate has raged for centuries over how exactly we ought to\nunderstand this assumption and whether or not we ought to believe it.\nImportantly, this assumption is generally understood as a kind of no\ncircularity assumption. In debating whether the assumption is correct,\nhistorical figures are, albeit indirectly, debating whether or not the\nrelation at issue can have reflexive instances. The same goes for\ndiscussions around God\u2019s nature as a self-causer. If the\nrelation at issue is that of grounding, then the history of philosophy\nis rich in discussions about grounding.\n\nUltimately, however, it seems that the \u201cIs grounding old or\nnew?\u201d question should give way to nuanced and text-based\ndiscussions of structural similarities and causal continuities between\nspecific thinkers. As this entry will make clear, contemporary figures\ndon\u2019t fully agree on the concept of grounding. Hence, it seems\nthat there is little to be gained by asking whether thus-and-so\nhistorical figures used the same notion as the contemporary figures,\nas the contemporary figures aren\u2019t using the same notion\nthemselves! Beyond tracing out similarities and differences in content\nof various notions employed by historical figures and paths of\nhistorical development, the question of whether grounding is old or\nnew will apparently always be a crude generalization over these\nsimilarities and continuities. And note that there is nothing special\nabout grounding in this regard\u2014the same could be said for\nvirtually any philosophically interesting concept, such as causation\nor necessity. (For discussions of historical connections to the\nancient period, see, e.g., Corkum 2016 and 2020, Evans 2012, and\nMalink 2020; for the early and late modern periods, see, e.g., Amijee\n2020, Bliss 2019, Casati 2018, Mulligan 2020, Pearce 2017, Roski 2017,\n2020, and Stang 2019.)\n2. The Nature of Grounding\n\nThere are a variety of issues to address related to the nature of\ngrounding. In this section we focus on objectivity, representation,\nhyperintensionality, non-monotonicity, whether grounding is a strict\norder, and whether grounding is well-founded. There are other\ninteresting issues concerning the nature of grounding that we\ndon\u2019t have the space to discuss here. One such issue is that of\nmeta-ground, viz. what if anything grounds the facts about\nwhat grounds what (see Litland 2020 for an overview).\n2.1 Objectivity and representation\n\nWhat are the central features of grounding? Grounding theorists\nroutinely claim that grounding is fully objective. But, given that\nobjectivity and related notions are used in a variety of ways in\nphilosophy, it comes as no surprise that there are different ways of\nunderstanding precisely what is being claimed here. On one approach,\nthe issue chiefly concerns the regimentation of grounding discourse.\nIf grounding claims are to be formulated with a parameter for facts\nconcerning human mental activity, then grounding isn\u2019t fully\nobjective (Dasgupta 2017). On a more \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\napproach, the issue instead chiefly concerns the essence or nature of\ngrounding, specifically whether grounding is essentially connected to\nsubjects. Suppose, for example, that part of what it is to be\ngrounding is that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\) only if\ncertain epistemic conditions obtain (e.g., actual subjects are in a\nposition to understand certain propositions concerning \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 and \\([Q]\\)). In this case, grounding isn\u2019t\nobjective.\n\nWhat might speak in favor of objectivism about grounding? Perhaps our\nconsidered views about causation should guide our theorizing about\ngrounding (cf. Bernstein 2015). Schaffer (2016a) conceives of\ngrounding as being broadly analogous to causation and proposes to\nextend the familiar structural equation models for causation to\ngrounding. And A. Wilson (2018) argues that grounding is indeed a type\nof causation, proposing an interventionist account of grounding. So,\nprovided that it\u2019s a bad idea to outfit causal claims with a\nparameter for facts concerning human mental activity, this is probably\na bad idea for grounding claims as well (cf. Bernstein 2018).\nSubjectivism (the claim that, while some facts ground other facts,\ngrounding isn\u2019t fully objective), however, isn\u2019t beyond\nthe pale. One potential route to subjectivism is this: endorse\nunionism (grounding is explanationG) and argue\nthat explanationG is by its nature subject\ninvolving (Maurin 2019; Thompson 2018).\n\nRoughly speaking, the representational approach to grounding\nhas it that grounding is intimately tied to representation (Fine\n2012a; Rosen 2010), while the worldly approach denies this\n(Audi 2012b; Schaffer 2012). While the representational/worldly\ndistinction is somewhat hazy, we understand it to be orthogonal to the\nobjective/subjective distinction. One way to sharpen the distinction\nbetween the representational and worldly approaches is as follows: on\nthe former, the relata of grounding have concepts among their\nconstituents; on the latter, this isn\u2019t the case (Kr\u00e4mer\n& Roski 2015; Correia 2017). So understood, the representational\napproach comes in two varieties: either facts are composed entirely of\nconcepts or they\u2019re a mixture of concepts and\nnon-representational items like objects and properties. On the former\nview, facts are akin to Fregean propositions; on the latter view,\nthey\u2019re instead akin to ordered sets of concepts and\nnon-representational items. (See Correia 2010 for a discussion of the\ndistinction between the representational and worldly approaches where\nit isn\u2019t assumed that grounding is a relation.)\n\nWhat hinges on whether grounding is representational or worldly? This\nisn\u2019t entirely clear. You might think that grounding being\nworldly ensures that the relata of grounding are relatively\ncoarse-grained, and grounding being representational ensures that the\nrelata of grounding are relatively fine-grained. Consider the\nfollowing two facts: [The liquid is H2O] and [The liquid is\nwater]. Representationalists, so the thinking goes, might claim that\nwe have distinct facts here, as they have different concepts as\nconstituents. And proponents of the worldly approach might claim that\nwe have only one fact here, as there is no difference in constituents\nor manner of combination. And this, of course, is potentially relevant\nto theorizing about grounding\u2014if [The liquid is H2O]\nand [The liquid is water] are the same fact, then the claim that the\nformer grounds the latter or vice versa is false provided that\ngrounding is irreflexive (see\n \u00a72.3).\n Note, however, that representationalists can coherently maintain that\nfacts are relatively coarse-grained\u2014perhaps they think that,\nwhile facts are Fregean propositions, concepts are relatively\ncoarse-grained (Correia 2020). And proponents of the worldly approach\ncan coherently maintain that facts are relatively\nfine-grained\u2014perhaps they think that, while facts are true\nRussellian propositions (ordered sets of non-representational items\nincluding properties), properties are relatively fine-grained (Dorsey\n2015).\n\nYou might also think that if grounding is worldly then unionism is\nfalse. The idea is that, if grounding is worldly, then grounding\ncan\u2019t be a type of explanation, as explanation itself is\nrepresentational. There are, however, conceptions of explanation\nrelative to which explanation is non-representational, and a worldly\nunionist is free to appeal to explanation so conceived (Skiles and\nTrogdon 2021).\n2.2 Hyperintensionality and non-monotonicity\n\nGrounding theorists also routinely claim that grounding is\nhyperintensional (Bader 2013; Leuenberger 2014; Schaffer 2009). This\nissue concerns what linguistic distinctions grounding is sensitive to.\nIt will be helpful to begin by considering the hyperintensionality of\nbelief. Consider the following belief attribution:\n\nAmy believes that Mark Twain was a humorist.\n\n\nNote that, were we to replace\n\nMark Twain was a humorist\n\n\nas it appears in this belief attribution with a necessarily\nco-extensional expression such as\n\nSamuel Clemens was a humorist\n\n\nthe resulting belief attribution may have a different truth-value than\nthe original one. This is the sense in which belief is thought to be\nhyperintensional.\n\nWe can understand the claim that grounding is hyperintensional in a\nsimilar way. Consider again the following grounding claim:\n\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing} exists].\n\n\nWere we to replace\n\n[Beijing exists]\n\n\nas it appears in this grounding claim with a necessarily\nco-extensional expression such as\n\n[{Beijing} exists]\n\n\nthe resulting grounding claim may have a different truth-value than\nthe original one. In this case, it seems that the two grounding claims\ndo in fact differ in truth-value\u2014while the original grounding\nclaim is true, the resulting one is presumably false. (See Duncan,\nMiller, & Norton 2017 for discussion of the relationship between\ngrounding and various senses of hyperintensionality.)\n\nGrounding theorists also normally claim that grounding is\nnon-monotonic (Audi 2012a; Guigon 2018; Rosen 2010). Logical\nentailment is monotonic in the following sense: if one sentence\nlogically entails another, then the first sentence together with any\nother sentence logically entails the second. Returning to grounding,\nsuppose that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). And suppose\nthat \\([R],\\) \\([R'],\\) \u2026 obtain. Grounding is non-monotonic\njust in case these suppositions are compatible with it not being the\ncase that \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 together with \\([R],\\) \\([R'],\\)\n\u2026 grounds \\([Q]\\). To take an example, consider again\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing}\nexists]. Rather than replacing [Beijing exists] in\nthis sentence with something else as we did above, let\u2019s add\nsome other nominalized true sentence to it such as [Gomer is a\ngood dog]. The resulting sentence (i.e., [Beijing\nexists], [Gomer is a good dog] grounds\n[{Beijing} exists]) is clearly false, while our\noriginal grounding claim (we\u2019re supposing, anyway) is true.\n2.3 Strict ordering\n\nSome claim that grounding is a strict order\u2014it\u2019s\ntransitive, irreflexive, and asymmetric (Correia 2010; Fine 2012a;\nRaven 2013). One way to argue that grounding has some or all of these\nfeatures is to embrace separatism (grounding is\ndeterminationG) and argue that\ndeterminationG or determination in general has\nsome or all of them (Audi 2012a). Another option is to embrace\nunionism (grounding is explanationG), focusing on\nthe features of explanationG or explanation in\ngeneral (Raven 2015). Another way, still, is to argue that, given\neither separatism or unionism, grounding plays the theoretical roles\nnormally assigned to it only if it has some or all of these features\n(Kovacs 2018). These strategies can be used to argue that grounding\nhas further properties as well. For example, Litland (2013) and Raven\n(2015) claim that explanation in general is non-monotonic, so, given\nunionism, grounding is as well; and Audi (2012a) claims that\ndetermination in general is non-monotonic, so, given separatism,\ngrounding is as well.\n\nWhile the view that grounding is a strict-order is the prevailing\nview, what reasons might there be to think otherwise? (As Bliss &\nPriest [2018b] note, there are various possible combinations of formal\nproperties that we may wish to ultimately consider.) Let\u2019s begin\nwith transitivity. Consider the following case, adapted from one that\nSchaffer (2012) proposes. Suppose that the following claims are true,\nwhere g is a metal globe:\n\n(1)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way] grounds [g has\ndeterminate shape S].\n(2)\n[g has determinate shape S] grounds [g\nis more-or-less spherical].\n\n\nIf grounding is transitive, then the following is true as well:\n\n(3)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way] grounds [g is\nmore-or-less spherical].\n\n\nYou might think, however, that\n (3)\n is false\u2014as Schaffer puts the idea, \u201cThe thing is\nmore-or-less spherical despite the minor dent, not because of\nit\u201d (2012: 127). Note that\n (1)\n concerns merely partial grounding, while\n (2)\n concerns full grounding. But, as any merely partial ground is a\npartial ground, and any full ground is a partial ground, we can read\n(1)\u2013(3) as targeting partial grounding, so there is no\nequivocation here.\n\nHow might proponents of transitivity respond? Litland (2013) proposes\nthat we can add a fact to the merely partial ground for [g\nhas determinate shape S] to get a full ground:\n\n(4)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way], [g elsewhere\nhas determinate shape \\(S'\\)] fully grounds [g has\ndeterminate shape S].\n\n\nGiven that\n (2)\n also concerns full grounding, the transitive inference from\n (4)\n and\n (2)\n is the following:\n\n(5)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way], [g elsewhere\nhas determinate shape \\(S'\\)] fully grounds [g is\nmore-or-less spherical].\n\n\nLitland claims that\n (5)\n is plausible, or at least as plausible as\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n And, provided that any collection of facts that is a full ground is\nsuch that any fact among that collection is a partial ground,\n (3)\n follows from\n (5).\n (See Raven 2015 for a similar treatment of this case; see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2015 and Tahko 2013 for potential counterexamples to\ntransitivity involving truth.)\n\nTurning to irreflexivity, Bliss (2018) critically assesses the general\ntheoretical motivations for thinking that grounding is irreflexive.\nLowe (1998: 145) suggests that self-explanatory states of affairs are\nepistemically possible, so perhaps a characterization of grounding\nshouldn\u2019t rule this out. Historically, certain influential\nthinkers have thought that the fact that God exists, for example, is a\nself-explanatory state of affairs. Fine (2010) and Kr\u00e4mer (2013)\nalso discuss various cases that seem to involve violations of\nirreflexivity. Here is a case along the lines of those they\ndiscuss\u2014consider the following fact: [Some fact or other\nobtains]. Some facts do indeed obtain, so of course [Some fact or\nother obtains] itself obtains. And it seems that any fact that obtains\nis something that grounds this fact. Since [Some fact or other\nobtains] is itself a fact that obtains, it follows that this fact\ngrounds itself!\n\nIn response to cases like this, Woods (2018) distinguishes between\nwhat he calls vacuous and non-vacuous grounding.\nWoods suggests that cases like [Some fact or other obtains] involve\nvacuous grounding, and, while vacuous grounding isn\u2019t\nirreflexive, non-vacuous grounding is. Roughly speaking, \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 vacuously grounds \\([Q]\\) when the former grounds\nthe latter, yet the identity and nature of the constituents of\n\\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 aren\u2019t explanatorily relevant to\n\\([Q]\\) obtaining. Perhaps [The truck is red] is a vacuous ground for\n[Some fact or other obtains]\u2014while the former grounds the\nlatter, it seems that the identity and nature of the truck and the\nproperty of being red don\u2019t contribute to explaining why [Some\nfact or other] obtains.\n\nTurning to asymmetry, Bliss (2014) and Thompson (2016, 2018)\ncritically assess the general theoretical motivations for thinking\nthat grounding is asymmetric and propose potential counterexamples.\nThompson suggests that, given the functional relationship between\nmass, volume, and density (the density of a substance is its mass\ndivided its volume), we should accept that, say, [g has\n3cm3 volume] grounds [g has 2g/cm3\ndensity] and vice versa. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that many\nreciprocal functional relationships don\u2019t involve symmetric\ngrounding. As Alexander Skiles has suggested to us in conversation,\nthere is, for example, a reciprocal functional relationship between\nhow many things are Socrates and how many members Socrates\u2019\nsingleton has, but it\u2019s clear in which direction the grounding\nruns in this case.\n2.4 Well-foundedness\n\nAnother issue is whether grounding is well-founded. Different\nauthors mean different things in claiming that grounding is\nwell-founded. According to Schaffer, grounding is well-founded in the\nsense that downwardly non-terminating chains of grounds are\nimpossible. In conceiving of grounding as a relation between entities\nin general and not just facts, Schaffer\u2019s rationale concerns the\nnotion of reality inheritance. Schaffer claims that, were\nthere downwardly non-terminating grounding chains, the being of any\nobject in such a chain would be \u201cinfinitely deferred, never\nachieved\u201d (2010: 62). Something \u201c\u2026cannot be real\nmerely by having a limitless sequence of ancestors, each claiming\nreality from its parents\u201d; instead, \u201cThere must actually\nbe a source of reality somewhere\u201d (2016a: 95). This echoes\nLeibniz, who claims that in the event that every object is a being of\naggregation, \u201cone never arrives at any real being\u201d (Adams\n1994: 333).\n\nOthers claim that grounding is well-founded in the sense that any\ngrounded fact is ultimately grounded by ungrounded facts (Dixon 2016;\nRabin & Rabern 2016). Note that this conception of the\nwell-foundedness of grounding, in contrast to the one above, allows\nfor infinitely descending grounding chains. How so? Following Bliss\n(2013) and Rabin and Rabern (2016), consider Euclidean space, which is\ncomprised of points and regions that include those points. Suppose\nthat regions are gunky in that every region has a region as a proper\npart. And suppose that the existence facts concerning regions are\ngrounded by the existence facts concerning their sub-regions, the\nexistence facts concerning sub-regions are grounded by the existence\nfacts concerning their sub-sub-regions, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. Hence, the fact that region R exists is a\nmember of an infinitely descending grounding chain. But suppose that\nthe existence facts concerning regions are also grounded by the\nexistence facts concerning points. Suppose, moreover, that the\nexistence facts concerning points lack grounds. Hence, while the fact\nthat R exists is a member of an infinitely descending\ngrounding chain, this fact nonetheless is grounded in facts that\nthemselves lack grounds. The same applies to all the other facts that\nare links in the grounding chain in question.\n\nIt may be that, if considerations involving reality inheritance are\nrelevant here, they ultimately support the idea that grounding is\nwell-founded in the second sense rather than the first. While there\nmay be something wrong about reality inheritance in the absence of a\nsource of reality, perhaps there is nothing wrong about endless\nreality inheritance per se. (See Puryear 2020 for discussion\nof the historical context of reality inheritance and Trogdon 2018b for\nfurther discussion of reality inheritance in the contemporary\ncontext.)\n3. Why Think There is Grounding?\n3.1 Arguments from theoretical utility\n\nThat grounding figures in ordinary and philosophical thinking (and\nperhaps other domains as well) and that many grounding claims are\nfairly easy to evaluate (e.g., [Beijing exists] grounds\n[{Beijing} exists]) gives us defeasible reason to\nthink that there is grounding (deRosset 2020). What else can be said\non behalf of grounding? Proponents of grounding tend to think that\nit\u2019s a justified posit on the basis of its theoretical utility.\nIn this section we set out three theoretical utility arguments for\ngrounding that involve unity, explanation, and the direction of\npriority.\n\nThe unity argument says that grounding is a justified posit\nbecause of its unifying role (Audi 2012a; Rosen 2010; Schaffer 2009).\nOn one way of casting the argument, it has three premises. First,\nthere is substantial unity among the metaphysical relations (relations\nfamiliar from metaphysics such as functional realization and set\nformation that resist analysis in purely modal terms). Second, where\nthere is substantial unity, plausibly there is a unifier, something\nthat explains why the relations in question resemble one another in\nthe manner they do. Third, if there is a unifier for the metaphysical\nrelations, the best candidate is grounding.\n\nThe explanation argument says that grounding is a justified\nposit because of its explanatory role (Audi 2012a; Dasgupta 2014a;\nFine 2012a; Litland 2017; Schaffer 2016a). Recalling the distinction\nbetween unionism and separatism (see\n \u00a71.1),\n the argument proceeds differently depending on which view is in play\n(Kovacs 2017). Given separatism (grounding is\ndeterminationG), one way to cast the explanation\nargument is as follows: there is a form of explanation\u2014what we\ncan call ontic explanation\u2014such that explanations of\nthis form are backed by worldly relations; and, among the ontic\nexplanations are ones such that the best candidate for the relation\nthat plays the backing role is determinationG.\nGiven unionism (grounding is explanationG), one\nway to cast the argument is as follows: there is a form of\nexplanation, what we can call metaphysical explanation, such\nthat the connections in metaphysical explanations are best expressed\nin terms of explanationG.\n\nThe priority argument says that grounding is a justified\nposit because of its direction-fixing role\u2014it fixes the\ndirection of priority between facts, where one fact is prior to\nanother only if the former is more fundamental than the latter. (See\n \u00a74.3\n for further discussion of fundamentality; J. Wilson (2014) initially\nproposes the priority argument but rejects it\u2014more on this\nbelow.) Let a priority case be one in which some fact is\nprior to another and entities these facts concern are yoked by\nmetaphysical relations. One way to cast the priority argument is as\nfollows: there are priority cases in which the direction of\nmetaphysical relations doesn\u2019t determine which fact is prior to\nthe other; and the best candidate for that which fixes the direction\nof priority in such cases is grounding.\n\nWe can cast arguments for grounding in terms of theoretical roles in\naddition to those specified by the unity, explanation, and priority\narguments as well. Some, for example, claim that the thesis of\nphysicalism (roughly, the view that the world is ultimately\nphysical in nature) is usefully formulated in terms of grounding\n(Block 2015; Dasgupta 2014a; Schaffer 2017b). With respect to\nphysicalism about the mental in particular (roughly, the view\nthat mental phenomena are nothing over and above physical phenomena),\na simple grounding-theoretic formulation of the view is this: the\nmental facts are grounded by (non-mental) physical facts (perhaps\ntogether with other non-mental facts such as indexical and totality\nfacts). It\u2019s by now a familiar idea that purely modal\nformulations of physicalism are inadequate, as there are coherent\nversions of dualism that such formulations don\u2019t rule out\n(Horgan 1993, 2006). Hence, one point in favor of appealing to\ngrounding in this context is that grounding isn\u2019t a purely modal\nnotion. And Block (2015) argues that even physicalism formulated in\nterms of a priori entailment faces the same problem, pointing to a\nparticular grounding formulation of physicalism as the way to resolve\nthe issue.\n\nAs for further potential theoretical applications, some have proposed\ngrounding-theoretic accounts of:\n\nthe nature of properties (Audi 2016; Carmichael 2016);\nthe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic\nproperties\u2014roughly, properties that something has just in virtue\nof how that thing is (e.g., being made of tin) vs. properties\nsomething has because of how it's related to wholly distinct\nthings (e.g., being next to a tin cup) (Rosen 2010; Witmer et al\n2005);\nwhat it is for an object (e.g., Socrates) in contrast to a word\n(e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019) to have a definition (Rosen 2015);\nwhat it is for one claim to reduce to another (Fine 2001)\nwhat it is for the world to be stratified into levels (Rabin 2018;\nSchaffer 2012);\nhow moral facts (e.g., facts about what we\u2019re morally\nobligated to do) are related to natural facts (e.g., facts concerning\nwhat maximizes utility) (Rosen 2017);\nthe special explanatory gap between the experiential and physical\ntruths (Rabin 2019; Trogdon forthcoming);\nwhat it is for the existence of certain entities to depend on the\nexistence of others (Schnieder 2020);\nwhat it is for truths to be such that things in the world make\nthem true (Correia 2014; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005; Schnieder 2006);\nwhat it is for one theory to be more parsimonious than another\n(Schaffer 2013);\nthe nature of free will and moral responsibility (Sartorio\n2013);\nwhat it is for something (e.g., gender) to be a social\nconstruction (Griffith 2018; Schaffer 2017a);\nthe historically important view that everything has an explanation\n(Amijee 2020a; Dasgupta 2016; K. McDaniel 2019; Schnieder &\nSteinberg 2015);\nhow multiple objects can exist at the same place and time (Saenz\n2015);\nthe view that only present things exist (Baron 2014);\nthe relation between being F (e.g., being blue)\nand having the property F-ness (e.g., having\nblueness) (Dixon 2018);\nhow mental events (e.g., pain) can cause physical events (e.g.,\nwincing) given that such physical events have physical causes (e.g.,\nC-fiber firing) (Clark & Wildman 2018; Kroedel & Schulz 2016);\nStenwall 2021; Tiehen 2015).\n\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list\u2014there is something of a\ncottage industry of developing grounding-theoretic accounts of items\nof philosophical interest.\n3.2 Skeptical responses\n\nSome are skeptical of grounding. A distinction can be drawn between\nwhat we might call first-wave and second-wave\ngrounding skepticism (see Koslicki 2020, though she uses different\nterminology). First-wave skepticism is characterized by a general\nconcern about the intelligibility of the notion. Daly (2012) argues\nthat the notion of grounding doesn\u2019t really make sense. In a\nsimilar spirit, Hofweber (2009) states that grounding theorists are\nguilty of engaging in a problematic form of metaphysics\u2014while\nthey make use of perfectly ordinary terms such as priority,\nfundamental and ultimately, they use them in a\ndistinctively non-ordinary, metaphysical way. (For non-skeptical\nrejoinders to first-wave skepticism, see Audi 2012b and Raven 2012.)\nSecond-wave skeptics, by contrast, generally grant that the notion of\ngrounding is coherent, but they think that it doesn\u2019t belong in\nour theoretical toolkit in any case, as the arguments in favor of\npositing grounding aren\u2019t persuasive. What unites second-wave\nskeptics is a shared sense that grounding theorizing is simultaneously\nundermotivated and overreaching.\n\nWith respect to the unity argument, Koslicki (2015) and J. Wilson\n(2016a) challenge the second premise, arguing that, even if the\nmetaphysical relations (or some sub-collection thereof) are\nsubstantially unified, this on its own wouldn\u2019t give us a good\nreason to posit a generic relation of grounding as a unifier. J.\nWilson (2014) challenges the first premise as well, arguing that there\nis a class of metaphysical relations, what she calls the\nsmall-g grounding relations, that are neither\nterminologically, formally, nor metaphysically unified. Relatedly,\nTurner (2016) describes various differences in the way certain kinds\nof grounding claims behave, ultimately distinguishing between two\nforms of grounding, dependence-grounding and\nrealization-grounding. (For non-skeptical rejoinders to these\nchallenges, see Raven 2017, and Schaffer 2016b.)\n\nRoughly speaking, monists claim that there is ultimately just\none core type of grounding, while pluralists claim that there\nare different types and no core type. It\u2019s important to note\nthat being a pluralist about grounding doesn\u2019t necessarily make\nyou a grounding skeptic, at least given how we understand the usage of\nthe terms. It\u2019s true that some pluralists, as we\u2019ve just\nseen, are skeptics. But not all of them are. For example, Fine\n(2012a), a proponent of grounding if anyone is, stresses the\ndifferences between various forms of grounding, rejecting the idea\nthat they are unified in a way that might motivate positing a genetic\nform of grounding. Just what might make it fitting to call one\npluralist view a version of skepticism about grounding and another\npluralist view non-skeptical instead is perhaps worth further thought.\n(For further discussion of monism and pluralism about grounding, see\nBerker 2018, Cohen 2020, Griffith 2014, Litland 2018b, Rettler 2017,\nand Richardson 2020 and 2021.)\n\nAs for the explanation argument, Kovacs (2017) objects to both the\nseparatist and unionist versions set out above. For example, Kovacs\nargues that, with respect to the former version of the argument,\nworldly relations such as necessitation taken together with facts\nabout their relata, rather than determinationG,\nback ontic explanations. Relatedly, Miller and Norton (2017) propose\nan explanation of why you might judge, say, that {Beijing} exists\nbecause Beijing exists that doesn\u2019t appeal to grounding. And\nNorton and Miller (2019) propose an account of the truth conditions\nfor statements of such explanations that doesn\u2019t appeal to\ngrounding.\n\nReturning to the priority argument, there are two types of priority\ncases to consider: cases in which the prior fact is fundamental, and\ncases in which neither the prior nor posterior facts are fundamental.\nJ. Wilson (2014, 2016a) develops a proposal according to which a\nprimitive notion of fundamentality plays the direction-fixing role in\npriority cases of the first type. And this primitive notion and other\ngrounding-free considerations (e.g., modal considerations) play the\ndirection-fixing role in cases of the second type. (For non-skeptical\nrejoinders, see Cameron 2016 and Raven 2017.)\n\nWhat about additional theoretical applications of grounding? Returning\nto the application to physicalism discussed above, J. Wilson (2014)\npoints out that, as there are importantly different approaches to\ngrounding (ones disagreeing about, e.g., how grounding interacts with\nreduction, necessitation, and real definition\u2014see\n \u00a74),\n the bald grounding claim that the physical grounds the mental\ndoesn\u2019t on its own speak to even very basic characteristics of\nthe mental-physical interface. A natural response, however, is to\nsimply work in this context with an approach to grounding that is\nfleshed out to a degree that such issues aren\u2019t left open\n(deRosset 2020; cf. J. Wilson 2016a). Still, questions about the\ntheoretical utility of grounding-theoretic formulations of physicalism\nremain, including whether the nothing-over-and-above notion central to\ninitial characterizations of physicalism is best captured in terms of\ngrounding (Melnyk 2016; J. Wilson 2016b).\n\nTo take another example, Sider (2011: Ch. 8; 2020) questions whether\ngrounding is apt to play the role of a level connector. Intuitively,\nthe world has an overarching structure where entities occupy different\nlevels of reality. One way to formulate the view that grounding is a\nlevel connector is this: different levels of reality are connected to\none another by virtue of grounding relations between facts\ncharacterizing occupants of these levels. With this in mind, consider\nthe fundamental physical level and a higher level, one occupied by\ncities. The grounding theorist might claim that these levels are\nconnected partly in virtue of the fact that some quantum-mechanical\nfact, Q, grounds the fact, N, that New York is a\ncity. But Sider asks: what is the grounding profile of this grounding\nfact? On the face of it, [Q grounds N] itself is\nungrounded. Roughly speaking, the worry is this: provided that any\nentity that an ungrounded fact concerns is fundamental in nature, it\nfollows that New York is a fundamental entity. Hence, it may be that\nin using grounding to explain how different levels of reality are\nconnected, we get unacceptable results about which entities are\nfundamental. (See\n \u00a74.3\n for more on fundamentality; for an overview of views according to\nwhich facts like [Q grounds N] are grounded, see\nLitland 2020.)\n\nFor a different skeptical take on grounding related to its theoretical\napplications, Della Rocca (2014) and Tallant (2018: Ch. 5) argue, very\nroughly, that various metaphysical claims (e.g., material objects\npersist over time and truths have truthmakers) are false, as these\nclaims are ultimately about what grounds what but there is no\ngrounding.\n4. Interaction with Other Notions\n\nIn this section we focus on how grounding might be related to the\nnotions of necessity, essence, and fundamentality. There are\ninteresting issues concerning the relationship between grounding and\nother phenomena that we don\u2019t have the space to discuss here. In\naddition to the examples listed at the beginning of this entry (e.g.,\nreal definition and truthmaking), one such issue concerns the relation\nbetween grounding and degrees of reality. Indeed, K. McDaniel\n(2017: Ch. 8) sketches an account of the former in terms of the\nlatter.\n4.1 Necessity\n\nHow do grounding and necessity interact? Let \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 (metaphysically) necessitate \\([Q]\\) just in case any\n(metaphysically) possible world in which the former obtains is a world\nin which the latter obtains. The broad consensus is that necessity\nisn\u2019t sufficient for grounding\u2014it\u2019s not the case\nthat if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 necessitate \\([Q]\\), then the\nformer ground the latter. (B. McDaniel 2019, however, argues that a\nrestricted form of necessitation is sufficient\u2014as well as\nnecessary\u2014for grounding.) Consider a necessary fact such as\n[\\(2+3=5\\)]. While this fact might have grounds, facts about, say,\nGerman Expressivist art aren\u2019t among them; yet the latter\nnecessitate the former. Also, there are cases in which the direction\nof necessitation and grounding come apart. Plausibly, [{Beijing}\nexists] necessitates [Beijing exists], yet presumably the later\ngrounds the former rather than the other way around.\n\nThere are, however, two other issues about the relationship between\ngrounding and necessity that are less of a settled matter. The first\nis whether it\u2019s necessary that (full) grounds necessitate what\nthey ground\u2014according to necessitarianism,\nnecessitation is necessary for grounding. The second is whether\ngrounding is an internal relation in the following sense: it\u2019s\nnecessary that if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 (fully) grounds \\([Q]\\),\nthen any metaphysically possible world in which \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 and \\([Q]\\) obtain is a world in which the former (fully)\ngrounds the latter. According to internalism, grounding is\ninternal in this sense. Internalism entails necessarianism but not\nvice versa. Due to limitations of space, we focus on necessitarianism\nin what follows. (See Bennett 2011, Litland 2015, Carnino 2017, and\nLovett 2019 for discussion of internalism.)\n\nFollowing Skiles 2020, there are at least three ways to go about\nmotivating necessitarianism. One appeals to essences: every instance\nof grounding is mediated by essential truths that characterize the\ngrounds and what they ground or entities these facts concern (see\n \u00a74.2);\n these essential truths are themselves necessary; and grounds together\nwith these essential truths suffice for what they ground (Audi 2012a;\nO\u2019Conaill 2017; Trogdon 2013b). Another appeals to explanation:\nit\u2019s necessary that grounds explain what they ground in a\ndistinctive way; and, for any explanation of this type, its explanans\nsuffices for its explanandum (deRosset 2010). And another appeals to\nlaws: every instance of grounding is subsumed by a metaphysical law;\nthe metaphysical laws are themselves necessary; and grounds together\nwith the relevant metaphysical laws suffice for what they ground\n(Wilsch 2015).\n\nWhat might a counterexample to necessitarianism look like? Following\nSkiles (2015), suppose that the following accidental generalization\nobtains:\n\n(1)\n[All Fs are Gs].\n\n\nAnd suppose that exactly n things are F; let them be\n\\(a_1\\), \\(a_2,\\) \u2026 \\(a_n\\). While\n\n(2)\n\\([a_1\\) is G, \\(a_2\\) is G, \u2026 \\(a_n\\) is\nG]\n\n\nclearly doesn\u2019t necessitate\n (1),\n Skiles proposes that the latter fully grounds the former. Grounding\nnecessitarians might reply that here we have mere partial\ngrounding\u2014to get a full ground for\n (1),\n to\n (2)\n we would need to add\n\n(3)\n[The only F things are \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2,\\ldots\\)\n\\(a_n\\)].\n\n\nSkiles considers this reply, noting that\n (3)\n is itself an accidental generalization, one that presumably has full\ngrounds. Hence, this fact too stands in need a necessitating ground\nprovided that necessitarianism is true. What then fully grounds\n (3)?\n A natural proposal is that\n\n(4)\n\\(a_1\\) is F, \\(a_2\\) is F, \u2026 and \\(a_n\\)\nis F.\n(5)\n\\(a_{n+1}\\) is not F, \\(a_{n+2}\\) is not F,\n\u2026 and \\(a_{n+m}\\) is not F.\n(6)\nFor any x, \\(x = a_1\\) or \\(x = a_2\\), or\n\u2026 \\(x = a_{n+m}\\).\n\n\ndoes so. And note that these facts together necessitate\n (3).\n But what is the grounding profile of\n (6)?\n Intuitively,\n\n(7)\n\\(a_1\\) exists, \\(a_2\\) exists, \u2026. and \\(a_{n+m}\\)\nexists\n\n\ngrounds\n (6).\n You might claim that\n (7)\n is a non-necessitating full ground of\n (6).\n But one option for necessitarians is to argue that\n (7)\n is instead a special sort of merely partial ground, one that\ncan\u2019t be augmented with further facts to yield a full ground.\nThis is how Trogdon and Witmer (2021) treat this case and, as a\nconsequence, reject the standard definition of partial grounding (see\n \u00a71.3).\n (See Chudnoff 2016; Ch. 6 and Leuenberger 2014 for discussion of\nother potential counterexamples to necessitarianism).\n4.2 Essence\n\nHow do grounding and essence interact? On the relevant notion of\nessence, essence isn\u2019t a purely modal matter\u2014while all\nessential truths about some item (truths that characterize what it is\nto be that item) are necessary, not all necessary truths about some\nitem are essential truths about it (Fine 1994). For example, anything\nthat is identical to Beijing is a city, and this is a candidate\nessential truth about Beijing. But, while it\u2019s necessary that\nBeijing exists only if {Beijing} exists, this isn\u2019t a candidate\nessential truth about the city (though it\u2019s a candidate\nessential truth about {Beijing}). Intuitively, you can know everything\nthere is to know about what it is to be Beijing and not thereby know\nanything about sets.\n\nWe begin with an essence-to-grounding principle, one specifying a\npotential entailment from truths about essence to truths about what\ngrounds what. According to Rosen (2010), for any x, if\nit\u2019s essential to x that P, then [It\u2019s\nessential to x that P] grounds \\([P]\\) (see also\nDasgupta 2016 and Kment 2014: Ch. 6). Rosen points out that this\nprinciple, if true, may clarify the grounding profile of certain\nuniversal facts. For example, perhaps [It\u2019s essential to\ntriangularity that all triangles have three sides] grounds [All\ntriangles have three sides]. (See Glazier 2017 and Zylstra 2019b for\ncritical discussion.)\n\nTurning to grounding-to-essence principles, some, such as Correia\n(2013), O\u2019Conaill (2018), and Trogdon (2013b), focus in this\ncontext on putative essential truths that themselves don\u2019t\ndirectly concern grounding (e.g., part of what it is to be the\nproperty of being maroon is that, for any x, if x is\nmaroon, then x is red). Others, such as Audi (2012a), focus\non corresponding essential truths that encode information about what\ngrounds what (e.g., part of what it is to be the property of being\nmaroon is that, for any x, if x is maroon, then\n[x is maroon] grounds [x is red]). Let\u2019s focus\non putative essential truths of the former, grounding-free variety,\nwhere these truths are understood to characterize facts rather than\nentities they concern.\n\nYou might think that, if \\([P]\\), \\([P'],\\) \u2026 grounds \\([Q],\\)\nthen part of what it is to \\([Q]\\) is that if \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\)\n\u2026 obtains then \\([Q]\\) obtains. As Fine (2012a) notes, however,\nthere are potential counterexamples. While [Socrates is a philosopher]\ngrounds [Someone is a philosopher], on the face of it no essential\ntruth about the latter encodes information about Socrates in\nparticular. One possibility is to weaken the proposal so that the\nessential truths may characterize either \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026\nor \\([Q]\\). (A further consideration is whether we should understand\nthis principle as allowing for the relevant essential truths to be\nirreducibly collective.) Fine (2012a) takes a different route,\nclaiming that, whenever some facts ground another fact, there will be\nsome true generalization of this grounding connection that\n\ndoesn\u2019t mention the grounds;\nsuffices, together with the grounds, for the grounded; and\nis an essential truth about the grounded.\n\n\nWith respect to the case just mentioned, Fine proposes that this is\nthe relevant generalization: for any x, if x is a\nphilosopher, then [x is a philosopher] grounds [Someone is a\nphilosopher]. Fine notes that this principle, if true, suggests a\ntop-down approach to establishing what grounds what, one where we\nbegin with those facts we take to be grounded and then work our way\ndown to their grounds.\n\nAs Rosen notes (2010), however, these principles rule out so-called\nMoorean connections, grounding connections that aren\u2019t mediated\nby essential truths. If, say, non-reductive physicalism about the\nmental is best formulated in terms of Moorean connections as Rosen\nsuggests, then the above grounding-to-essence principle has the\nundesirable result of ruling out what is arguably the dominant view\nconcerning the metaphysics of mind.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t have the space to explore these proposals here,\nsome have proposed not just essence-to-grounding or\ngrounding-to-essence principles but full-blown accounts of essence in\nterms of grounding or vice versa. deRosset (2013) and Gorman (2014)\npropose accounts of essence in terms of grounding. (See Zylstra 2018\nfor critical discussion.) Correia (2013) and Zylstra (2019a) instead\npropose accounts of grounding in terms of essence. Finally, some have\nproposed accounts of both essence and grounding in terms of some third\nitem\u2014Fine (2015) does so in terms of constitutively necessary\nand sufficient conditions, and Correia and Skiles (2019) in terms of\ngeneralized identity. (See Zylstra 2020 for critical discussion of\neach of the above accounts.)\n4.3 Fundamentality\n\nHow are grounding and fundamentality related? Here we focus on\nfundamentality with respect to facts, as opposed to, say, entity or\ntheory fundamentality. There are two general types of fundamentality,\nrelative and absolute. As for relative fundamentality, the general\nidea is that some facts are more fundamental than others. A simple\ngrounding-theoretic account of relative fundamentality is this: for\neach fact among \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 to be more fundamental\nthan \\([Q]\\) is for \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 to ground \\([Q]\\).\nTurning to absolute fundamentality, the idea is that some facts are\nfundamental full stop. On one familiar conception of absolute\nfundamentality, to be absolutely fundamental is to enjoy a distinctive\nform of independence (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5). One way for a\nfact to be independent is for it not to be grounded by other facts.\nThis suggests a simple grounding-theoretic account of absolute\nfundamentality: to be absolutely fundamental it to be ungrounded\n(Schaffer 2009).\n\nYou might think that the above account of relative fundamentality\nfails to identify a necessary condition, especially if you assume\nthat, for any two facts, one of them is more fundamental than the\nother or they\u2019re equally fundamental. For example, perhaps\n[There are hydrogen atoms in Phoenix] is more fundamental than [There\nare H2O molecules in Ithaca] even though the former\ndoesn\u2019t ground the latter (Bennett 2017: Ch. 6). (For more\nsophisticated characterizations of relative fundamentality that appeal\nto grounding, see Bennett 2017: Ch. 6 and Werner 2021.)\n\nReturning to absolute fundamentality, you might worry that the above\naccount leaves out an important dimension, specifically the fact that\nthe absolutely fundamental facts are complete in the sense\nthat, since they are the basic building blocks of reality, to describe\nthem is in some sense to provide a description of everything (Tahko\n2018). Note that absolute fundamentality conceived of as involving\nboth independence and completeness seems to capture the notion of an\nunexplained explainer\u2014the absolutely fundamental facts are\nindependent and therefore unexplained, and these facts are complete\nand therefore explain (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5). Looking to the history of\nphilosophy, we see that fundamental entities are regularly invoked as\na means of meeting certain kinds of explanatory demands, demands that\nperhaps only independent entities could meet. This is typically\nevidenced by the arguments from vicious infinite regress that are\ncommonly wielded in defense of them. It\u2019s because we need to\nexplain, for example, why there are any contingent things whatsoever\nthat God must exist and, importantly, if God weren\u2019t the\nterminus point of our regress\u2014because independent\u2014then the\nproblem that God was invoked to solve wouldn\u2019t be solved after\nall.\n\nWith this in mind, we might revise the simple account of absolute\nfundamentality above as follows: to be fundamental is to be a member\nof some collection of facts, F, such that\n\neach fact among F is both ungrounded and grounds some\nfact; and\nfacts among F ground all the grounded facts.\n\n\nWe might wish to add further conditions ensuring that F is\nminimal (there is no proper sub-collection of F that\ngrounds all the grounded facts) and F is\nunique\u2014F is the only collection that satisfies\nthese conditions. Another option is to interpret completeness (or\nunique minimal completeness) as being characteristic but not\ndefinitional of absolute fundamentality (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5).\n(Whether definitional or not, the grounding role that absolutely\nfundamental facts play potentially makes the cost of positing such\nfacts worth paying\u2014see Bliss 2019 for discussion.) Still another\noption for the grounding theorist is to be a pluralist about notions\nof absolute fundamentality, characterizing independence, completeness,\nand perhaps further notions as well such as ineliminability,\ngranting that they might (in special cases) pull apart. (See Raven\n2016 for discussion of ineliminability in this context.)\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Robert Merrihew, 1994, <em>Leibniz: Determinist, Theist,\nIdealist</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Aizawa, Kenneth and Carl Gillett (eds.), 2016, <em>Scientific\nComposition and Metaphysical Ground</em>, London: Palgrave Macmillan\nUK. doi:10.1057/978-1-137-56216-6", "Amijee, Fatema, 2020, \u201cPrinciple of Sufficient\nReason\u201d, in Raven 2020: 63\u201375.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2021, \u201cExplaining Contingent\nFacts\u201d, <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 178(4): 1163\u20131181.\ndoi:10.1007/s11098-020-01487-y", "Audi, Paul, 2012a, \u201cGrounding: Toward a Theory of the\n<em>In-Virtue-Of</em> Relation\u201d, <em>Journal of Philosophy</em>,\n109(12): 685\u2013711. doi:10.5840/jphil20121091232", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012b, \u201cA Clarification and Defense\nof the Notion of Grounding\u201d, in Correia and Schnieder 2012:\n101\u2013121. doi:10.1017/CBO9781139149136.004", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cProperty Identity\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy Compass</em>, 11(12): 829\u2013840.\ndoi:10.1111/phc3.12380", "Bader, Ralf M., 2013, \u201cTowards a Hyperintensional Theory of\nIntrinsicality\u201d, <em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 110(10):\n525\u2013563. doi:10.5840/jphil2013110109", "Baron, Sam, 2015, \u201cThe Priority of the Now\u201d,\n<em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 96(3): 325\u2013348.\ndoi:10.1111/papq.12030", "Beebee, Helen and Julian Dodd, 2005, <em>Truthmakers: The\nContemporary Debate</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.\ndoi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199283569.001.0001", "Bennett, Karen, 2011, \u201cBy Our Bootstraps\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>, 25: 27\u201341.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1520-8583.2011.00207.x", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, <em>Making Things Up</em>, Oxford:\nOxford University Press. doi:10.1093/oso/9780199682683.001.0001", "Berker, Selim, 2018, \u201cThe Unity of Grounding\u201d,\n<em>Mind</em>, 127(507): 729\u2013777. doi:10.1093/mind/fzw069", "Bernstein, Sara, 2016, \u201cGrounding Is Not Causation\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>, 30(1): 21\u201338.\ndoi:10.1111/phpe.12074", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2018, \u201cCausal Idealism\u201d, in\n<em>Idealism: New Essays in Metaphysics</em>, Tyron Goldschmidt and\nKenneth L.
