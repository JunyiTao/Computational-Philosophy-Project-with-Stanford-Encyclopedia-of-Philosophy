    "main_text": "Philosophical Project\n3. Philosophical Project\n\nAs the title of the Treatise proclaims, Hume\u2019s subject\nis human nature. He summarizes his project in its subtitle: \u201can\nattempt to introduce the experimental method into moral\nsubjects\u201d. In his day, \u201cmoral\u201d meant anything\nconcerned with human nature, not just ethics, as he makes clear at the\nbeginning of the first Enquiry, where he defines \u201cmoral\nphilosophy\u201d as \u201cthe science of human nature\u201d (EHU\n1.1/5). Hume\u2019s aim is to bring the scientific method to bear on\nthe study of human nature.\n\nHume\u2019s early studies of philosophical \u201csystems\u201d\nconvinced him that philosophy was in a sorry state and in dire need of\nreform. When he was only 18 years old, he complained in a letter that\nanyone familiar with philosophy realizes that it is embroiled in\n\u201cendless Disputes\u201d (HL 3.2). The ancient philosophers, on\nwhom he had been concentrating, replicated the errors their natural\nphilosophers made. They advanced theories that were \u201centirely\nHypothetical\u201d, depending \u201cmore upon Invention than\nExperience\u201d. He objects that they consulted their imagination in\nconstructing their views about virtue and happiness, \u201cwithout\nregarding human Nature, upon which every moral Conclusion must\ndepend\u201d. The youthful Hume resolved to avoid these mistakes in\nhis own work, by making human nature his \u201cprincipal Study, &\nthe Source from which I would derive every Truth\u201d (HL 3.6).\n\nEven at this early stage, the roots of Hume\u2019s mature approach to\nthe reform of philosophy are evident. He was convinced that the only\nway to improve philosophy was to make the investigation of human\nnature central\u2014and empirical (HL 3.2). The problem with ancient\nphilosophy was its reliance on \u201chypotheses\u201d\u2014claims\nbased on speculation and invention rather than experience and\nobservation.\n\nBy the time Hume began to write the Treatise three years\nlater, he had immersed himself in the works of the modern\nphilosophers, but found them disturbing, not least because they made\nthe same mistakes the ancients did, while professing to avoid them.\nWhy, Hume asks, haven\u2019t philosophers been able to make the\nspectacular progress in understanding human nature that natural\nphilosophers\u2014whom we now call\n\u201cscientists\u201d\u2014have recently achieved in the physical\nsciences? His answer is that while scientists have cured themselves of\ntheir \u201cpassion for hypotheses and systems\u201d, philosophers\nhaven\u2019t yet purged themselves of this temptation. Their theories\nwere too speculative, relied on a priori assumptions, and\npaid too little attention to what human nature is actually like.\nInstead of helping us understand ourselves, modern philosophers were\nmired in interminable disputes\u2014evident even to \u201cthe rabble\nwithout doors\u201d\u2014giving rise to \u201cthe common prejudice\nagainst metaphysical reasonings of all kinds\u201d, that is,\n\u201cevery kind of argument which is in any way abstruse, and\nrequires some attention to be comprehended\u201d (T xiv.3).\n\nTo make progress, Hume maintains, we need to \u201creject every\nsystem \u2026 however subtle or ingenious, which is not founded on\nfact and observation\u201d. These systems, covering a wide range of\nentrenched and influential metaphysical and theological views, purport\nto have discovered principles that give us a deeper and more certain\nknowledge of ultimate reality. But Hume argues that in attempting to\ngo beyond anything we can possibly experience, these metaphysical\ntheories try to \u201cpenetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to\nthe understanding\u201d (EHU 1.11/11), which makes their claims to\nhave found the \u201cultimate principles\u201d of human nature not\njust false, but unintelligible. These \u201cairy sciences\u201d, as\nHume calls them, have only the \u201cair\u201d of science (EHU\n1.12/12).\n\nWorse still, these metaphysical systems are smokescreens for\n\u201cpopular superstitions\u201d that attempt to overwhelm us with\nreligious fears and prejudices (EHU 1.11/11). Hume has in mind a\nvariety of doctrines that need metaphysical cover to look\nrespectable\u2014arguments for the existence of God, the immortality\nof the soul, and the nature of God\u2019s particular providence.\nMetaphysics aids and abets these and other superstitious\ndoctrines.\n\nBut he insists that because these metaphysical and theological systems\nare objectionable, it doesn\u2019t mean we should give up doing\nphilosophy. Instead, we need to appreciate \u201cthe necessity of\ncarrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy\u201d.\nThe only way to resist the allure of these pseudo\u2013sciences is to\nengage with them, countering their \u201cabstruse \u2026\nmetaphysical jargon\u201d with \u201caccurate and just\nreasoning\u201d (EHU 1.12/12).\n\nThis means that the initial phase of Hume\u2019s project must be\ncritical. A prominent part of this aspect of his project is\nto \u201cdiscover the proper province of human\nreason\u201d\u2014determining the extent and limits of\nreason\u2019s powers and capacities (EHU 1.12/12). He believes that\nhis investigation will show that metaphysics as the quest for\nunderstanding the ultimate nature of reality is beyond reason\u2019s\nscope.\n\nScholars once emphasized this critical phase at the expense\nof the rest of Hume\u2019s project, encouraging the charge that he\nwas just a negative skeptic, who rejects the views of others without\ndefending any positive position himself. But while he is indeed\nskeptical about the possibility of metaphysical insights that go\ndeeper than science can, investigating the proper province of reason\nisn\u2019t only a critical activity. His critique of metaphysics\nclears the way for the constructive phase of his\nproject\u2014the development of an empirical science of human\nnature\u2014and Hume is not at all skeptical about its prospects.\n\nIn his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Treatise, Hume\nlaunches the constructive phase of his project by proposing nothing\nless than \u201ca compleat system of the sciences, built on a\nfoundation entirely new\u201d (T xvi.6). The new foundation is the\nscientific study of human nature. He argues that all the sciences have\nsome relation to human nature, \u201ceven Mathematics, Natural\nPhilosophy, and Natural Religion\u201d (T xv.4). They are all human\nactivities, so what we are able to accomplish in them depends on\nunderstanding what kinds of questions we are able to handle and what\nsorts we must leave alone. If we have a better grasp of the scope and\nlimits of our understanding, the nature of our ideas, and the\noperations we perform in reasoning about them, there is no telling\nwhat improvements we might make in these sciences.\n\nWe should expect even more improvement in the sciences that are more\nclosely connected to the study of human nature: \u201cLogic,\nMorals, Criticism, and Politics\u201d. Many longstanding\nphilosophical debates are about the nature of our\nideas\u2014causation, liberty, virtue and beauty\u2014so getting\nclear about their content should help us cut through these\n\u201cendless disputes\u201d.\n\nAs the science of human nature is the only solid foundation for the\nother sciences, \u201cthe only solid foundation we can give to this\nscience itself must be laid on experience and observation\u201d (T\nxvi.7). Although Hume does not mention him by name, Newton\n(1642\u20131727) is his hero. He accepts the Newtonian maxim\n\u201cHypotheses non fingo\u201d, roughly, \u201cI do not\ndo hypotheses\u201d. Any laws we discover must be established by\nobservation and experiment.\n\nHume is proposing an empiricist alternative to traditional\na priori metaphysics. His empiricism is naturalistic\nin that it refuses to countenance any appeal to the\nsupernatural in the explanation of human nature. As a\nnaturalist, he aims to account for the way our minds work in a manner\nthat is consistent with a Newtonian picture of the world.\n\nHume portrays his scientific study of human nature as a kind of\nmental geography or anatomy of the mind (EHU\n1.13/13; T 2.1.12.2/326). In the first section of the first\nEnquiry, he says that it has two principal tasks, one purely\ndescriptive, the other explanatory. Mental geography\nconsists in delineating \u201cthe distinct parts and powers\u201d of\nthe mind (EHU 1.13/3). While everyone can make some sense of the basic\ndistinctions among the mind\u2019s contents and operations, more\nfine\u2013grained distinctions are harder to grasp.\n\nHume, however, wants to go much further. He wants to explain\nhow the mind works by discovering its \u201csecret springs and\nprinciples\u201d. He reminds us that astronomers, for a long time,\nwere content with proving the \u201cmotions, order, and magnitude of\nthe heavenly bodies\u201d. But then \u201ca\nphilosopher\u201d\u2014Newton\u2014went beyond them and determined\n\u201cthe laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets\nare governed and directed\u201d (EHU 1.15/14). Newton\u2019s example\nled other natural philosophers to similar explanatory successes. Hume\nbelieves he will be equally successful in finding the fundamental laws\ngoverning our \u201cmental powers and economy\u201d, if he follows\nthe same caution Newton exhibited in carrying out his inquiries.\n\nNewton\u2019s scientific method provides Hume with a template for\nintroducing the experimental method into his investigation of the\nmind. In An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, he\nsays he will follow \u201ca very simple method\u201d that he\nbelieves will bring about a transformation in the study of human\nnature. Following Newton\u2019s example, he argues that we should\n\u201creject every system \u2026 however subtile or ingenious,\nwhich is not founded on fact and observation\u201d, and accept only\narguments derived from experience. When we inquire about human nature,\nsince we are asking \u201ca question of fact, not of abstract\nscience\u201d, we must rely on experience and observation (EPM\n1.10/173\u2013174).\n\nAs the fledgling Newton of the moral sciences, Hume wants to find a\nset of laws that explain how the mind\u2019s\ncontents\u2014perceptions, as he calls them\u2014come and\ngo in the mind and how simple perceptions combine to form complex\nperceptions in ways that explain human thought, belief, feeling and\naction.\n\nNewton\u2019s achievement was that he was able to explain diverse and\ncomplex physical phenomena in terms of a few general principles. Like\nhim, Hume proposes to explain \u201call effects from the simplest and\nfewest causes\u201d (T xvii.8). He predicts that it is likely that\none \u201cprinciple of the mind depends on another\u201d and that\nthis principle may in turn be brought under another principle even\n\u201cmore general and universal\u201d (EHU 1.15/15). But he\nemphasizes that while he will try to find the most general principles,\nrendering them as universal as possible, all of his explanations must\nbe based completely on experience.\n\nAlthough philosophy, as an empirical enterprise, is itself bound by\nexperience, this is not a defect in the science of human nature. The\nsame is true for all the sciences: \u201cNone of them can go beyond\nexperience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that\nauthority\u201d (T Intro 10). Explanations must come to an end\nsomewhere. When we see that we have \u201carriv\u2019d at the utmost\nextent of human reason, we sit down contented\u201d, for the only\nreason we can give for our most general principles is \u201cour\nexperience of their reality\u201d (T 9).\n\nHume is Newtonian in much more than method. He sees that Newton is\nsignificantly different from John Locke (1632\u20131704) and the\nother Royal Society natural philosophers, because he rejects their\nmechanist picture of the world. Newton\u2019s greatest discovery, the\nLaw of Gravitation, is not a mechanical law. Hume explicitly models\nhis account of the fundamental principles of the mind\u2019s\noperations\u2014the principles of association\u2014on the idea of\ngravitational attraction. By appealing to these same principles\nthroughout, Hume gives an explanation of these diverse phenomena that\nenable him to provide a unified and economical account of the\nmind.\n",
