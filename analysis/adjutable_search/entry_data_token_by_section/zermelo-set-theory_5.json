    "main_text": "The Major Problems with Zermelo's System || Completeness\n3.2  Completeness\nThere were also problems with the completeness of Zermelo's theory,\nsince there were important theoretical matters with which Zermelo does\nnot deal, either for want of appropriate definitions showing how\ncertain constructions can be represented in a pure theory of sets, or\nbecause the axioms set out in Zermelo's system are not strong\nenough.\n3.2.1  Representing Ordinary Mathematics\nZermelo gives no obvious way of representing much of\n\u2018ordinary mathematics\u2019, yet it is clear from his opening\nremarks that he regards the task of the theory of sets to stand as the\nfundamental theory which should \u2018investigate mathematically the\nfundamental notions \u201cnumber\u201d, \u201corder\u201d, and\n\u201cfunction\u201d \u2019. \n(See \u00a71.)\nThe first obvious question concerns the representation of the\nordinary number systems. The natural numbers are represented by\nZermelo as by \u2205, {\u2205}, {{\u2205}}, \u2026, and the Axiom\nof Infinity gives us a set of these. Moreover, it seems that, since\nboth the set of natural numbers and the power set axiom are available,\nthere are enough sets to represent the rationals and the reals,\nfunctions on reals etc. What are missing, though, are the details: how\nexactly does one represent the right equivalence classes, sequences\netc.? And assuming that one could define the real numbers, how does\none characterise the field operations on them? In addition, as\nmentioned previously, Zermelo has no natural way of representing\neither the general notions of relation or of function. This means that\nhis presentation of set theory has no natural way of representing\nthose parts of mathematics (like real analysis) in which the general\nnotion of function plays a fundamental part.\nA further difficulty is that the lack of the notion of function\nmakes the general theory of the comparison of sets by size (or indeed\nby order) cumbersome. Zermelo does develop a way of expressing, for\ndisjoint sets a, b, that a is of the same size\nas b, by first defining a \u2018product\u2019 of two disjoint\nsets, and then isolating a set of unordered pairs (a certain subset of\nthis product) which \u2018maps\u2019 one of the sets one-to-one onto\nthe other. But this is insufficiently general, and does not in any\ncase indicate any way to introduce \u2018the\u2019 size\nof a. Russell's method (defining the cardinality of M as\nthe set card(M) = {N : N\n\u223c M} (where \u2018\u223c\u2019 means\n\u2018cardinally equivalent to\u2019) is clearly inappropriate,\nsince with a set a = {b},\ncard(a) (which should be the cardinal number 1) is as big as\nthe universe, and the union set of 1 would indeed be the\nuniversal \u2018set\u2019. Over and above this, there is the more\nspecific problem of defining the aleph numbers.\nThe second major difficulty is along the same lines, concerning,\nnot functions, but relations, and thus ordering relations and ordinal\nnumbers. As we have seen\n(in \u00a72.2.4), Zermelo has the\nbeginnings of an answer to this in his second proof of the WOT, for\nthis uses a theory of subset-orderings to represent the underlying\nordering of a set. It turns out that the method given in this\nparticular case suggests the right way to capture the general\nnotion.\n3.2.2  Ordinality\nZermelo's idea (1908a) was pursued by Kuratowski in the 1920s,\nthereby generalising and systematising work, not just of Zermelo, but\nof Hessenberg and Hausdorff too, giving a simple set of necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a subset ordering to represent a linear\nordering. He also argues forcefully that it is in fact undesirable for\nset theory to go beyond this and present a general theory of ordinal\nnumbers:\n\nIn reasoning with transfinite numbers one implicitly uses an\n  axiom asserting their existence; but it is desirable both from the\n  logical and mathematical point of view to pare down the system of\n  axioms employed in demonstrations. Besides, this reduction will free\n  such reasoning from a foreign element, which increases its\n  \u00e6sthetic value. (Kuratowski 1922: 77)\n\nThe assumption here is clearly that the (transfinite) numbers will\nhave to be added to set theory as new primitives. Kuratowski however\nundertakes to prove that the transfinite numbers can be dispensed with\nfor a significant class of \n applications.[34]\n Application of the ordinal numbers in\nanalysis, topology, etc. often focuses on some process of definition\nby transfinite recursion over these numbers. Kuratowski succeeds in\nshowing that in a significant class of cases of this kind, the\nordinals can be avoided by using purely set-theoretic methods which\nare reproducible in Zermelo's system. As he notes:\n\nFrom the viewpoint of Zermelo's axiomatic theory of sets, one can\nsay that the method explained here allows us to deduce theorems of a\ncertain well-determined general type directly from Zermelo's axioms,\nthat is to say, without the introduction of any independent,\nsupplementary axiom about the existence of transfinite\nnumbers. (Kuratowski 1922: \n 77)[35]\n\nIt is in this reductionist context that Kuratowski develops his\nvery general theory of maximal inclusion orderings, which shows, in\neffect, that all orderings on a can really be represented as\ninclusion orderings on appropriate subsets of the power set\nof a, thus reducing ordering to Zermelo's primitive relation\n\u03b5.\nOne immediate, and quite remarkable, result of this work is that it\nshows how one can define the general notions of relation and function\nin purely set-theoretic terms. It had long been recognised that\nrelations/functions can be conceived as sets of ordered pairs, and\nKuratowski's work now shows how to define the ordered pair\nprimitively. The ordered pair (a, b) can be considered\ninformally as the unordered pair M = {a, b},\ntogether with an ordering relation a < b. Suppose\nthis relation is treated now via the theory of inclusion chains. The\nonly maximal inclusion chains in the power set of M are\n{\u2205, {a}, {a, b}} and {\u2205,\n{b}, {a, b}}. Using\nKuratowski's definition of the ordering \u2018<\u2019 derived\nfrom a maximal inclusion chain, these chains must then correspond to\nthe orderings a < b and b < a\non {a, b} respectively. If\n\u2205 is ignored, the resulting chain {{a},\n{a, b}} is thus associated with the\nrelation a < b, and so with the ordered set (pair)\n(a, b). It is then quite natural to define\n(a, b) as {{a},\n{a, b}} (see Kuratowski 1921: 170\u2013171). One\ncan now define the product a\n\u00d7 b of a and b as the set of all\nordered pairs whose first member is in a and whose second\nmember is in b; relations on a can now be treated as\nsubsets of a \u00d7 a, and\nfunctions from a to b as certain subsets\nof a \u00d7 b. Thus, many of\nthe representational problems faced by Zermelo's theory are solved at\na stroke by Kuratowski's work, building as it does on Zermelo's\nown.\n3.2.3  Cardinality\nBut there was a problem concerning cardinality which is independent\nof the problem of definitional reduction. It was pointed out by both\nFraenkel and Skolem in the early 1920s that Zermelo's theory cannot\nprovide an adequate account of cardinality. The axiom of infinity and\nthe power set axiom together allow the creation of sets of\ncardinality \u2265 \u2135n\nfor each natural number n, but this (in the absence of a result\nshowing that 2\u21350 >\n\u2135n for every natural number n) is not\nenough to guarantee a set whose power is \u2265\n\u2135\u03c9, and a set of power\n\u2135\u03c9 is a natural next step (in the Cantorian\ntheory) after those of power \u2135n. Fraenkel\nproposed a remedy to this (as did Skolem independently) by proposing\nwhat was called the Ersetzungsaxiom, the Axiom of Replacement (see\nFraenkel 1922: 231 and Skolem 1923: 225\u2013226). This says,\nroughly, that the \u2018functional image\u2019 of a set must itself\nbe a set, thus if a is a set,\nthen {F(x) : x\n\u2208 a} must also be a set, where\n\u2018F\u2019 represents a functional correspondence. Such an\naxiom is certainly sufficient; assume that a0 is the\nset of natural numbers {0, 1, 2, \u2026}, and now assume that to\neach number n is associated an an with\npower \u2135n. Then according to the replacement\naxiom, a =\n{a0, a1, a2,\n\u2026} must be a set, too. This set is countable, of course, but\n(assuming that the an are all disjoint) the union set of a must have cardinality at\nleast \u2135\u03c9.\nThe main difficulty with the Replacement Axiom is that of how to\nformulate the notion of a functional correspondence. This was not\nsolved satisfactorily by Fraenkel, but the Weyl/Skolem solution works\nhere, too: a functional correspondence is (in effect) just any\nfirst-order 2-place predicate \u03d5(x, y) which\nsatisfies the condition of uniqueness,\ni.e., \u2200x, y, z{[\u03d5(x, y)\n\u2227 \u03d5(x, z)] \u2192 y = z}.\nWith this solution, the Replacement Axiom will be (as required)\nstronger than Zermelo's original Separation Axiom and indeed can\nreplace it; however, in Fraenkel's system, one can prove his version\nof the Replacement Axiom from his version of the Separation Axiom,\nwhich shows that his separate definition of function is not\nsufficiently strong. (For details, see Hallett 1984:\n282\u2013286.)\nZermelo initially had doubts about the Replacement Axiom (see the\nletter to Fraenkel from 1922 published in Ebbinghaus 2007: 137), but\nhe eventually accepted it, and a form of it was included in his new\naxiomatisation published in 1930 (Zermelo 1930). Skolem's formulation\nis the one usually adopted, though it should be noted that von\nNeumann's own formulation is rather different and indeed\nstronger.[36]\n3.2.4  Ordinals\nAlthough Kuratowski's work solved many of the representational\nproblems for Zermelo's theory, and the Replacement Axiom shows how the\nmost obvious cardinality gap can be closed, there still remained the\nissue (Kuratowski's view to one side) of representing accurately the\nfull extent of the theory which Cantor had developed, with the\ntransfinite numbers as fully fledged objects which\n\u2018mirror\u2019 the size/ordering of sets. Once the ordinal\nnumber-classes are present, the representation of the alephs is not a\nsevere problem, which means that the representation of transfinite\nnumbers amounts to assuring the existence of sufficiently many\ntransfinite ordinal numbers. Indeed, as was stated above, the\nhypothesis that the scale of aleph numbers is sufficient amounts to\nthe claim that any set can be \u2018counted\u2019 by some\nordinal. There are then two interrelated problems for the\n\u2018pure\u2019 theory of sets: one is to show how to define\nordinals as sets in such a way that the natural numbers generalise;\nthe other problem is to make sure that there are enough ordinals to\n\u2018count\u2019 all the sets.\nThe problem was fully solved by von Neumann in his work on\naxiomatic set theory from the early 1920s. Cantor's fundamental\ntheorems about ordinal numbers, showing that the ordinals are the\nrepresentatives of well-ordered sets, are the theorem that every\nwell-ordered set is order-isomorphic to an initial segment of the\nordinals, and that every ordinal is itself the order-type of the set\nof ordinals which precede it. These results prove crucial in the von\nNeumann treatment. Von Neumann's basic idea was explained by him as\nfollows:\n\nWhat we really wish to do is to take as the basis of our\nconsiderations the proposition: \u2018Every ordinal is the type of\nthe set of all ordinals that precede it\u2019. But in order to avoid\nthe vague notion \u2018type\u2019, we express it in the form:\n\u2018Every ordinal is the set of the ordinals that precede\nit\u2019. (von Neumann 1923, p. 347 of the English translation)\n\nAccording to von Neumann's idea, 1 is just {0}, 2 is just {0, 1}, 3\nis just {0, 1, 2} and so on. On this conception, the first transfinite\nordinal \u03c9 is just {0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026, n, \u2026},\nand generally it's clear that the immediate successor of any ordinal\n\u03b1 is just \u03b1 \u222a {\u03b1}. If we\nidentify 0 with \u2205, as Zermelo did, then we have available a\nreduction of the general notion of ordinal to pure set theory, where\nthe canonical well-ordering on the von Neumann ordinals is just the\nsubset relation, i.e., \u03b1 < \u03b2 just in case \u03b1 \u2282\n\u03b2, which von Neumann later shows is itself equivalent to saying\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03b2. (See von Neumann 1928, p. 328 of the\nreprinting.) So again, inclusion orderings are fundamental.\nVon Neumann gives a general definition of his ordinals, namely that\na set \u03b1 is an ordinal number if and only if it is a set ordered\nby inclusion, the inclusion ordering is a well-ordering, and each\nelement \u03be in \u03b1 equals the set of elements in the initial\nsegment of the ordering determined by \u03be. This connects directly\nwith Kuratowski's work in the following way. Suppose M is a\nwell-ordered set which is then mirrored by an inclusion\nchain M in the power set of M. Then the first few\nelements of the inclusion chain will be the sets \u2205, {a},\n{a, b}, {a, b, c}, \u2026,\nwhere a, b, c, \u2026 are the first, second,\nthird \u2026elements in the well-ordering of M. The von\nNeumann ordinal corresponding to M will also be an inclusion\nordering whose first elements will be\n\u2205, {\u2205}, {\u2205, {\u2205}}, {\u2205, {\u2205},\n  {\u2205, {\u2205}}}, \u2026\n(in other words, 0, 1, 2, 3\u2026), and we have 0 \u2282 1 \u2282 2\n\u2282 3 \u2282\u2026 in mirror image of\n\u2205 \u2282 {a} \u2282 {a, b} \n\u2282 {a, b, c}\n\u2282 \u2026\nThese von Neumann ordinals had, in effect, been developed before\nvon Neumann's work. The fullest published theory, and closest to the\nmodern account, is to be found in Mirimanoff's work published in 1917\nand 1921 (see Mirimanoff 1917a,b, 1921), though he doesn't take the\nfinal step of identifying the sets he characterises with the ordinals\n(for an account of Mirimanoff's work, see Hallett 1984:\n273\u2013275). It is also clear that Russell, Grelling and Hessenberg\nwere close to von Neumann's general set-theoretic definition of\nordinals. But crucially Zermelo himself developed the von Neumann\nconception of ordinals in the years 1913\u20131916, (for a full\naccount, see Hallett 1984: 277\u2013280 and Ebbinghaus 2007:\n133\u2013134). Zermelo's idea was evidently well-known to the\nG\u00f6ttingen mathematicians, and there is an account of it in\nHilbert's lectures \u2018Probleme der mathematischen\nLogik\u2019 from 1920,\npp. 12\u201315.[37]\nDespite all these anticipations, it is still right to ascribe the\ntheory to von Neumann. For it was von Neumann who revealed the extent\nto which a full theory of the ordinals depends on the Axiom of\nReplacement. As he wrote later:\n\nA treatment of ordinal number closely related to mine was known\n  to Zermelo in 1916, as I learned subsequently from a personal\n  communication. Nevertheless, the fundamental theorem, according to\n  which to each well-ordered set there is a similar ordinal, could not\n  be rigorously proved because the replacement axiom was unknown. (von\n  Neumann 1928: 374, n. 2)\n\nThe theorem von Neumann states is the central result of Cantor's\nmentioned here in the second paragraph of this section. As von Neumann goes on to point out\nhere (also p. 374), it is the possibility of definition by transfinite\ninduction which is key, and a rigorous treatment of this requires\nbeing able to prove at each stage in a transfinite inductive process\nthat the collection of functional correlates to a set is itself a set\nwhich can thus act as a new argument at the next stage. It is just\nthis which the replacement axiom guarantees. Once justified,\ndefinition by transfinite induction can be used as the basis for\ncompletely general definitions of the arithmetic operations on ordinal\nnumbers, for the definition of the aleph numbers, and so on. It also\nallows a fairly direct transformation of Zermelo's first (1904) proof\nof the WOT into a proof that every set can be represented by (is\nequipollent with) an ordinal number, which shows that in the Zermelo\nsystem with the Axiom of Replacement added there are enough ordinal\nnumbers.[38]\nIt is thus remarkable that von Neumann's work, designed to show how\nthe transfinite ordinals can be incorporated directly into a pure\ntheory of sets, builds on and coalesces with both Kuratowski's work,\ndesigned to show the dispensability of the theory of transfinite\nordinals, and also the axiomatic extension of Zermelo's theory\nsuggested by Fraenkel and Skolem.\n4.
