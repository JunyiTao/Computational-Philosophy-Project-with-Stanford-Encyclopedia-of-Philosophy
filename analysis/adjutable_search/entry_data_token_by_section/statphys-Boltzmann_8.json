    "main_text": "The H-theorem and the reversibility objection || 1877: The reversibility objection\n3.3 1877: The reversibility objection\n\n\nAccording to Klein (1973)  Boltzmann seemed to have\nbeen satisfied with his treatments of 1871 and 1872 and turned his\nattention to other matters for a couple of years. He did come back to\ngas theory in 1875 to discuss an extension of the Boltzmann equation to\ngases subjected to external forces. But this paper does not present any\nfundamental changes of thought. However, the 1875 paper did contain a\nresult which, two years later, led to a debate with Loschmidt. It\nshowed that a gas in equilibrium in an external force field (such as\nthe earth's gravity) should have a uniform temperature, and therefore,\nthe same average kinetic energy at all heights. This conclusion\nconflicted with the intuition that rising molecules must do work\nagainst the gravitational field, and pay for this by having a lower\nkinetic energy at greater heights.\n\n\nNow Boltzmann (1875) was not the first to reach the contrary result,\nand Loschmidt was not the first to challenge it. Maxwell and Guthrie\nentered into a debate on the very same topic in 1873. But actually\ntheir main point of contention need not concern us very much. The\ndiscussion between Loschmidt and Boltzmann is important for quite\nanother issue which Loschmidt only introduced as a side remark:\n\nBy the way, one should be careful about the claim that in\na system in which the so-called stationary state has been achieved,\nstarting from an arbitrary initial state, this average state can remain\nintact for all times. [\u2026] \nIndeed, if in the above case [i.e. starting in a state where one\nparticle is moving, and all the others lie still on the bottom], after\na time \u03c4 which is long enough to obtain the stationary state, one\nsuddenly assumes that the velocities of all atoms are reversed, we\nwould obtain an initial state that would appear to have the same\ncharacter as the stationary state. For a fairly long time this would\nbe appropriate, but gradually the stationary state would deteriorate,\nand after passage of the time \u03c4 we would inevitably return to our\noriginal state: only one atom has absorbed all kinetic energy of the\nsystem [\u2026], while all other molecules lie still on the bottom of the\ncontainer.\nObviously, in every arbitrary system the course of events\nmust be become retrograde when the velocities of all its elements are\nreversed.  (Loschmidt 1876, 139)\n\n\n\nPutting the point in more modern terms, the laws of (Hamiltonian)\nmechanics are such that for every solution one can construct another\nsolution by reversing all velocities and replacing \\(t\\) by\n\\(-t\\). Since \\(H[f]\\) is invariant under the velocity reversal, it\nfollows that if \\(H[f]\\) decreases for the first solution, it will\nincrease for the second. Accordingly, the reversibility objection is\nthat the H-theorem cannot be a general theorem for all\nmechanical evolutions of the gas.\n\nBoltzmann's response (1877a).  Boltzmann's responses\nto the reversibility objection are not easy to make sense of, and\nvaried in the course of time. In his immediate response to Loschmidt\nhe acknowledges that certain initial states of the gas would lead to\nan increase of the \\(H\\) function, and hence a violation of the\nH-theorem. The crux of his rebuttal was that such initial\nstates were extremely improbable, and could hence safely be\nignored.\n\n\nThis argument shows that Boltzmann was already implicitly embarking\non an approach that differed from the context of the 1872 paper. Recall\nthat this paper used the concept of probability only in the guise of a\ndistribution function, giving the probability of molecular velocities.\nThere was no such thing in that paper as the probability of a state of\nthe gas as whole. This conceptual shift would become more explicit in\nBoltzmann's next paper (1877b).\n\n\nThis rebuttal of Loschmidt is far from satisfactory. Any reasonable\nprobability assignment to gas states is presumably invariant under the\nvelocity reversal of the molecules. If an initial state leading to an\nincrease of \\(H\\) is to be ignored on account of its small\nprobability, one ought to assume the same for the state from which it\nwas constructed by velocity reversal. In other words, any\nnon-equilibrium state would have to be ignored. But that in effect\nsaves the H-theorem by restricting it to those cases where it\nis trivially true, i.e., where \\(H\\) is constant.\n\n\nThe true source of the reversibility problem was only identified by\nBurbury (1894a) and Bryan1 (1894), by pointing out that already the\nSto\u00dfzahlansatz contained a time-asymmetric\nassumption. Indeed, if we replace the SZA by the assumption that the\nnumber of collisions is proportional to the product \\(f(\\vec{v}'_1)\nf(\\vec{v}'_2)\\) for the velocities \\(\\vec{v}'_1, \\vec{v}'_2\\) after\nthe collision, we would obtain, by a similar reasoning, \\(dH/dt \\le\n0\\).  The question is now, of course, we would prefer one assumption\nabove the other, without falling into some kind of double\nstandards. One thing is certain, and that is that any such preference\ncannot be obtained from mechanics and probability theory alone.\n",
