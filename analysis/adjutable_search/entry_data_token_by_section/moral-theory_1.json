    "main_text": "Morality || Common-sense Morality\n1.1 Common-sense Morality\n\n\u2026 Common-sense is\u2026 an exercise of the judgment unaided\nby any Art or system of rules : such an exercise as we must\nnecessarily employ in numberless cases of daily occurrence ; in which,\nhaving no established principles to guide us \u2026 we must needs\nact on the best extemporaneous conjectures we can form. He who is\neminently skillful in doing this, is said to possess a superior degree\nof Common-Sense. (Richard Whatley, Elements of Logic, 1851,\nxi\u2013xii)\n\n\u201cCommon-Sense Morality\u201d, as the term is used here, refers\nto our pre-theoretic set of moral judgments or intuitions\nor\n principles.[1] \nWhen we\nengage in theory construction (see below) it is these common-sense\nintuitions that provide a touchstone to theory\nevaluation. Henry Sidgwick believed that the\nprinciples of Common-Sense Morality were important in helping us\nunderstand the \u201cfirst\u201d principle or principles\nof\n morality.[2] \nIndeed, some theory construction explicitly appeals to puzzles in\ncommon-sense morality that need resolution \u2013 and hence, need to\nbe addressed theoretically. \n\nFeatures of commons sense morality are determined by our normal\nreactions to cases which in turn suggest certain normative principles\nor insights. For example, one feature of common-sense morality\nthat is often remarked upon is the self/other asymmetry in morality,\nwhich manifests itself in a variety of ways in our intuitive\nreactions. For example, many intuitively differentiate morality\nfrom prudence in holding that morality concerns our interactions with\nothers, whereas prudence is concerned with the well-being of the\nindividual, from that individual\u2019s point of view.\n\nAlso, according to our common-sense intuitions we are allowed to\npursue our own important projects even if such pursuit is not\n\u201coptimific\u201d from the impartial point of view (Slote\n1985). It is also considered permissible, and even admirable, for\nan agent to sacrifice her own good for the sake of another even though\nthat is not optimific. However, it is impermissible, and outrageous,\nfor an agent to similarly sacrifice the well-being of another under the\nsame circumstances. Samuel Scheffler argued for a view in which\nconsequentialism is altered to include agent-centered prerogatives,\nthat is, prerogatives to not act so as to maximize the good (Scheffler\n1982).\n\nOur reactions to certain cases also seem to indicate a common-sense\ncommitment to the moral significance of the distinction between\nintention and foresight, doing versus allowing, as well as the view\nthat distance between agent and patient is morally relevant (Kamm\n2007).\n\nPhilosophers writing in empirical moral psychology have been working\nto identify other features of common-sense morality, such as how prior\nmoral evaluations influence how we attribute moral responsibility for\nactions (Alicke et. al. 2011; Knobe 2003).\n\nWhat many ethicists agree upon is that common-sense is a bit of a\nmess. It is fairly easy to set up inconsistencies and tensions\nbetween common-sense commitments. The famous Trolley Problem\nthought experiments illustrate how situations which are structurally\nsimilar can elicit very different intuitions about what the morally\nright course of action would be (Foot 1975). We intuitively\nbelieve that it is worse to kill someone than to simply let the person\ndie. And, indeed, we believe it is wrong to kill one person to\nsave five others in the following scenario:\n\nDavid is a great transplant surgeon. Five of his patients need new\nparts\u2014one needs a heart, the others need, respectively, liver,\nstomach, spleen, and spinal cord\u2014but all are of the same,\nrelatively rare, blood-type. By chance, David learns of a healthy\nspecimen with that very blood-type. David can take the healthy\nspecimen's parts, killing him, and install them in his patients, saving\nthem. Or he can refrain from taking the healthy specimen's parts,\nletting his patients die. (Thomson 1976, 206)\n\n\nAnd yet, in the following scenario we intuitively view it entirely\npermissible, and possibly even obligatory, to kill one to save\nfive:\n\n\nEdward is the driver of a trolley, whose brakes have just failed. On\nthe track ahead of him are five people; the banks are so steep that\nthey will not be able to get off the track in time. The track has a\nspur leading off to the right, and Edward can turn the trolley onto it.\nUnfortunately there is one person on the right-hand track. Edward can\nturn the trolley, killing the one; or he can refrain from turning the\ntrolley, killing the five. (Thomson 1976, 206).\n\nTheorizing is supposed to help resolve those tensions in a\nprincipled way. Theory construction attempts to provide\nguidance in how to resolve such tensions and how to understand\nthem.\n",
