    "main_text": "Frege\u2019s Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics\n2. Frege\u2019s Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics\n\n\nFrege provided a foundations for the modern discipline of logic by\ndeveloping a more perspicuous method of formally representing the\nlogic of thoughts and inferences. He did this by developing: (a) a\nsystem allowing one to study inferences formally, (b) an analysis of\ncomplex sentences and quantifier phrases that showed an underlying\nunity to certain classes of inferences, (c) an analysis\nof proof and definition, (d) a theory of extensions\nwhich, though seriously flawed, offered an intriguing picture of the\nfoundations of mathematics, (e) an analysis of statements about number\n(i.e., of answers to the question \u2018How many?\u2019), (f)\ndefinitions and proofs of some of the basic axioms of number theory\nfrom a limited set of logically primitive concepts and axioms, and (g)\na conception of logic as a discipline which has some compelling\nfeatures. We discuss these developments in the following\nsubsections. However, it should be noted that, for those who are\nencountering it for the first time, we have simplified the\npresentation of Frege\u2019s logic in a significant number of ways.\nFor those already familiar with the notation and who want to see a\nmore precise presentation, see the entry on\n  Frege\u2019s logic.\n",
