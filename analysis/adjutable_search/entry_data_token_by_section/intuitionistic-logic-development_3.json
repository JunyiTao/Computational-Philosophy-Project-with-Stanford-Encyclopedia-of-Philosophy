    "main_text": "Brouwer\u2019s Views on Logic in 1907 and 1908 || The Hypothetical Judgement\n2.2 The Hypothetical Judgement\n\nBrouwer realized (1907: 125\u2013128 [1975: 72\u201373]) that the\nhypothetical judgement seems to pose a problem for his view on logic\nas described above. For what is peculiar to the hypothetical\njudgement, Brouwer says, is that there the priority of mathematics\nover logic seems to be reversed. Among the examples he refers to are\nthe proofs found in elementary geometry of the problems of Apollonius.\nHere is one of them: Given three circles, defined by their centers and\ntheir radii, construct a fourth circle that is tangent to each of the\ngiven three. The way this is usually solved is first to assume that\nsuch a fourth circle exists, then to set up equations that express how\nit is related to the three given circles, and then, via algebraic\nmanipulations and logic, arrive at explicit definitions of the center\nand radius of the required circle, and, from there, at corresponding\nmathematical constructions. So it seems that here one first has to\nassume the existence of the required circle, then use logic to make\nvarious judgements about it, and only thereby arrives at a\nmathematical construction for it.\n\nHowever, Brouwer argues, this is not what really happens. His general\ninterpretation of such cases is as follows. Having first remarked that\nlogical reasoning accompanies or mirrors mathematical activity which\nis at least conceptually prior to that reasoning, Brouwer then\nsays:\n\n\nThere is a special case [\u2026] which really seems to presuppose\nthe hypothetical judgment from logic. This occurs where a structure in\na structure is defined by some relation, without it being immediately\nclear how to effect its construction. Here one seems to\nassume to have effected the required construction, and to\ndeduce from this hypothesis a chain of hypothetical judgments. But\nthis is no more than apparent; what one is really doing in this case\nis the following: one starts by constructing a system that fulfills\npart of the required relations, and tries to deduce from these\nrelations, by means of tautologies, other relations, in such a way\nthat in the end the deduced relations, combined with those that have\nnot yet been used, yield a system of conditions, suitable as a\nstarting-point for the construction of the required system. Only by\nthis construction will it then have been proved that the original\nconditions can indeed be satisfied. (Brouwer 1907: 126\u2013127\n[1975: 72; translation modified])\n\n\nDifferent readings of this concise passage have been proposed.\nAccording to one, Brouwer\u2019s passage bears on \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nin the following way:\n\n\\((\\alpha)\\) Brouwer\npoints out in the above lines that if the conditions and\nspecifications for \\(A\\) are given, then we try to add\nmore information in such a way that, after a certain amount of\nconstructional activity, we can really carry out a construction of \\(A\\)\nwhich respects the specifications. Once this is\naccomplished, we can turn to the \u201cimplication\u201d\nconstruction for \\(B\\), which yields the construction\nfor \\(B\\) and to the required embedding of the\nstructure for \\(A\\) into the structure for \\(B\\).\n(van Dalen 2004: 250\u2013251)\n\n\nAccording to interpretation \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) just means\n\\(A \\wedge B\\) with the extra information that the construction for\n\\(B\\) was obtained from that for \\(A\\).\nOn this reading \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) can be asserted only after a\nconstruction for \\(A\\) has been found. The idea is\nclear: namely, to avoid hypothetical constructions, and the use of\nlogic they require, by insisting that a construction be supplied that\nproves the antecedent. (As will be explained in Section 2.1 of the\n supplementary document \n  Objections to the Proof Interpretation,\n  Freudenthal (1937b) too has suggested this strategy, albeit\nwith a different motivation than this passage in Brouwer\u2019s\ndissertation.) But, as van Dalen also notices, it is also in effect a\nrejection of the hypothetical judgement in the general case where one\ndoes not know whether there is a construction for \\(A\\).\n\nAn alternative reading is \\(\\beta\\):\n\n\\((\\beta)\\) In order to\nestablish \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), one has to conceive of \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) as conditions on\nconstructions, and to show that from the conditions specified by \\(A\\)\none obtains the conditions specified by \\(B\\),\naccording to transformations whose composition\npreserves mathematical constructibility: if, by hypothesis, a\nconstruction for \\(A\\) has been made, then we can make\na construction for \\(B\\) (van Atten 2009:\n128).\n\n\nOn this reading, Brouwer\u2019s explanation of the hypothetical\njudgement avoids hypothetical constructions and the concomitant use of\nlogic by considering conditions on constructions instead of\nconstructions themselves. Instead of a \u201cchain of hypothetical\njudgements\u201d that one seems to make, one is really making a chain\nof transformations in which from required relations (i.e., given\nconditions) further relations are derived. It is, of course, a\nrequirement that these transformations preserve mathematical\nconstructibility, and that this preservation is itself intuitively\nknown. The role of conditions is explicit in a statement Brouwer made\nat the other end of his publishing career:\n\n\n[T]he wording of a mathematical theorem has no sense unless it\nindicates the construction either of an actual mathematical entity or\nof an incompatibility (e.g., the identity of the empty two-ity with an\nempty unity) out of some constructional condition imposed on a\nhypothetical mathematical system. (Brouwer 1954A: 3)\n\n\nBrouwer speaks not of an incompatibility constructed out of a\nhypothetical mathematical system, but out of some condition on its\nconstruction.\n\nBe that as it may, the preservation of constructibility from \\(A\\)\nto \\(B\\) is essential to both reading\n\\(\\alpha\\) and reading \\(\\beta\\), so on either it is clear that\nBrouwer had the Proof Interpretation of the implication in mind\nalready in 1907. For further discussion of Brouwer\u2019s passage on\nthe hypothetical judgement and the two readings of it mentioned here,\nsee Kuiper 2004, van Dalen 2004, van Dalen 2008, and van Atten\n2009.\n",
