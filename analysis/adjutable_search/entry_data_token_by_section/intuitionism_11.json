    "main_text": "Mathematics || Descriptive set theory, topology, and topos theory\n3.8 Descriptive set theory, topology, and topos theory\n\nBrouwer was not alone in his doubts concerning certain classical forms\nof reasoning. This is particularly visible in descriptive set theory,\nwhich emerged as a reaction to the highly nonconstructive notions\noccurring in Cantorian set theory. The founding fathers of the field,\nincluding \u00c9mile Borel and Henri Lebesgue as two of the main\nfigures, were called semi-intuitionists, and their\nconstructive treatment of the continuum led to the definition of the\nBorel hierarchy. From their point of view a notion like the set of all\nsets of real numbers is meaningless, and therefore has to be replaced\nby a hierarchy of subsets that do have a clear description. \n\nIn Veldman 1999, an intuitionistic equivalent of the notion of Borel\nset is formulated, and it is shown that classically equivalent\ndefinitions of the Borel sets give rise to a variety of\nintuitionistically distinct classes, a situation that often occurs in\nintuitionism. For the intuitionistic Borel sets an analogue of the\nBorel Hierarchy Theorem is intuitionistically valid. The proof of this\nfact makes essential use of the continuity axioms discussed above and\nthereby shows how classical mathematics can guide the search for\nintuitionistic analogues that, however, have to be proved in a\ncompletely different way, sometimes using principles unacceptable from\na classical point of view.\n\nAnother approach to the study of subsets of the continuum, or of a\ntopological space in general, has appeared through the development of\nformal or abstract topology (Fourman 1982, Martin-L\u00f6f 1970,\nSambin 1987). In this constructive topology the role of open sets and\npoints is reversed; in classical topology an open set is defined as a\ncertain set of points, in the constructive case open sets are the\nfundamental notion and points are defined in terms of them. Therefore\nthis approach is sometimes referred to as point-free topology.\n\nIntuitionistic functional analysis has been developed far and wide by\nmany after Brouwer, but since most approaches are not strictly\nintuitionistic but also constructive in the wider sense, this research\nwill not be addressed any further here.\n",
