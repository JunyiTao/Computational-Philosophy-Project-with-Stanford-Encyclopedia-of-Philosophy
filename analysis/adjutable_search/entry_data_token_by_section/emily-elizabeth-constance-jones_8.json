Russell\u2019s Recognition of Jones\n\nAs we have seen, Jones\u2019s and Russell\u2019s respective analyses\nof identity statements are similar and, moreover, similarly motivated.\nThis raises a question: did Russell, prior to their public exchange\n(discussed below), have any awareness of Jones\u2019s work? Complete\nignorance on Russell\u2019s part seems unlikely, considering that her\nteacher, Ward, and her champion, Stout, were Russell\u2019s teachers\nat\n Cambridge.[2]\n It seems plausible that they would have attempted to interest Russell\nin the work of someone whose concerns overlapped with his so\nsignificantly. Moreover, Russell was a regular reader of the journals\nto which Jones contributed; in several cases, the two appeared in the\nsame issue of Mind or of the Proceedings of the\nAristotelian Society. (In fact, Jones\u2019s contribution to\nThe Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society for\n1906\u201307, which occurs in the same issue as Russell\u2019s\n\u201cOn the Nature of Truth\u201d, is in part a commentary on\nRussell\u2019s paper.) But then we have another question\u2014why\ndoes he never cite her distinction? Surely his audience, in particular\nreaders of Mind, members of the Aristotelian Society and\nmembers of the Moral Sciences Club (see below), could be expected to\nbe acquainted with it. If so, then it would make sense to mention it,\nif only to show how his (or Frege\u2019s) version of the distinction\nis markedly different. Even if there is disagreement with the\nframework in which the distinction is grounded, Russell\u2019s total\nsilence demands an explanation. After all, in \u201cOn\nDenoting\u201d Russell cites approvingly Bradley\u2019s account of\nuniversal generalizations in terms of conditionals, even though he has\ndecisively parted ways with Bradley\u2019s logic. So he was clearly\ncapable of separating a valuable idea from the framework in which it\nis expressed.\n\nOne document of interest concerning the question of influence is a\nletter to Philip Jourdain, dated September 5, 1909. Jourdain had sent\nRussell the draft of a long survey article on Frege\u2019s work, in\nwhich he mentions Jones\u2019s distinction, in Jones (1890) and\n(1982a), between intension and denotation\u2014a distinction\nendorsed, as he noted in the published version of the article, by\nKeynes in the fourth (and final) edition of his influential text,\nStudies and Exercises in Formal Logic (Jourdain,\n1911\u201312, 201\u20132, footnote 153). Although Jourdain\u2019s\nletter is now lost, it appears he is querying Russell about the\nrelation between Jones\u2019s distinction and Frege\u2019s (and,\nquite possibly, Russell\u2019s related distinction between meaning\nand denotation). Here Russell responds:\n\nIt would seem, from what you say in your letter, that Miss\nJones\u2019s distinction of signification and denotation must be much\nthe same as Frege\u2019s Sinn and Bedeutung. But of course\nsome such distinction is a commonplace of logic, and\neverything turns on the form given to the distinction. I have neither\nKeynes nor Miss Jones here, or I would look up the point.\n(Grattan-Guinness 1977, 119)\n\n\nThe note displays a remarkable lack of charity. Russell, instead of\nexpressing interest in the possibility that Jones anticipated Frege on\nsense and reference, dismisses the distinction as \u201ca commonplace\nof logic.\u201d Going by what he writes here, how it is\nmade, and not the distinction itself, is what is crucial. But until\nRussell developed the theory of descriptions, the distinction was made\ninformally, both in his own case and in the case of Frege (1892).\n(While Frege 1893, \u00a711, does present a formal theory of definite\ndescriptions, one which could conceivably be employed as a formal\ntheory of sense, it is doubtful that Russell had this version of\nFrege\u2019s theory in mind when writing the above.) Surely the\ndistinction had been worth making in the cases of Frege and of his\nearlier self, even though no particular form seems to have been given\nto the distinction in either case. Russell\u2019s dismissal is\ntherefore puzzling.\n\nMoreover, had Russell consulted Keynes\u2019 account of Jones\u2019s\ndistinction, he would have encountered an example that is quite\nsimilar to one used by Frege in the opening paragraph of \u201cOn\nSense and Reference\u201d:\n\nIf out of all triangles we select those which possess the property of\nhaving three equal sides, and if again out of all triangles we select\nthose which possess the property of having three equal angles, we\nshall find that in either case we are left with precisely the same set\nof triangles. Thus, each side of our equation denotes precisely the\nsame class of objects, but the class is determined or arrived at in\ntwo different ways. (Keynes 1906, 190)\n\n\nWhether or not Keynes and Frege give the same \u201cform\u201d to\nthe distinction, Keynes\u2019s presentation is sufficiently close to\nFrege\u2019s to suggest that one could hardly be in a position to\ndismiss the one, but not the other, as\n \u201ccommonplace\u201d.[3]\n\nOne explanation of Russell\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s\ndistinction has to do with his correspondent. Jourdain, a former\nstudent of Russell\u2019s, was quite conversant with the developing\nmathematical logic (at least to a degree\u2014he was a competent, but\nnot quite first-rate, practitioner), went on to publish informed\nsurvey articles on (in addition to the piece on Frege already\nmentioned) Boole, Jevons, MacColl, and Peano, and had written on\nRussell\u2019s earlier work on the principles of mathematics.\nIt\u2019s conceivable that Russell resented the fact that Jourdain,\nexpert in both Oxbridge logic and mathematical logic, took Jones to be\ntouching on a point that he and Frege had already laid claim\nto\u2014perhaps even beating them to a crucial insight. Matters are\nmade worse by the suggestion that Jones had\u2014however casually and\nindirectly\u2014influenced Russell. Any indication either that he was\ninfluenced by Jones, or that she anticipated him in some small way,\nwould detract from Russell\u2019s own contribution. It is one thing\nto acknowledge a debt to a Frege or to a Peano. Russell saw these men\nnot only as intellectual giants, but also as introducing genuinely\nrevolutionary ideas and techniques into the study of logic and the\nfoundations of mathematics. Not only was Jones manifestly not\nof their caliber, she was also philosophically quite retrograde. For\nRussell, mindful both of the figures he was allying himself with and\nof the innovation in thought that they were introducing, acknowledging\nthat Jones had anticipated some of his ideas may have been repugnant.\nSmall wonder, then, that he kept silent on the matter in his published\nwork and correspondence. As it turns out, Jones was quickly\nto take credit (in print) for first giving expression to the\ndistinction (see Jones 1910\u201311), although she sensibly refrained\nfrom suggesting that her work influenced Russell.\n\nNone of this is to deny that there may have been entirely intellectual\nreasons for Russell\u2019s dismissal. As indicated, Russell clearly\nsaw Jones as a throwback to an earlier period. Thus, even if there was\nsome recognition that she had come upon a distinction quite similar to\nthat between sense and reference or meaning and denotation,\nRussell\u2019s indifference could quite easily be attributed to the\nfact that the insight was grafted onto a system of logic that he\n rejected.[4]\n\nSee Waithe and Cicero (1995, 37\u201343) for an extended discussion\nof the relation between Russell and Jones. \n",
