    "main_text": "The Arguments for Occasionalism || The \u201cConservation is but Continuous Creation\u201d (CCC) Argument\n4. Occasions and Occasional Causation\n\nWe end with a brief look at what \u201c occasional causes\u201d are\nand how occasionalists understand \u201coccasional\n causation.\u201d[35]\n As we saw at the beginning of this entry, an occasionalist is someone\nwho, within a relevant domain, denies that creaturely causes are\ngenuine causes and holds that the unique genuine cause is God. This\ndenial of the causal efficacy of creatures, however, is consistent\nwith the recognition that some creaturely events and their types stand\nin peculiar relations, noteworthy enough to deserve a special status\nin the causal story of the world. Most prominent, particularly to\nthose interested in causation, are the robust regularities found in\nthe world, the very regularities that initiated our interest in causal\nconnections in the first place. These regularities are of interest to\nthe occasionalist as well, and it is for these regularities that the\noccasionalist employs the notion of occasional causes. Here is how\nMalebranche describes them: \n\nA natural cause is therefore not a real and true cause but only an\noccasional cause, which determines the Author of nature to act in such\nand such a manner in such and such a situation.(Search 448)\n\n\nAn occasional cause here is described as determining God \u201cto act\nin such and such a manner in such and such a situation.\u201d The\ncentral idea is that when an event of a certain type occurs, a\ndistinct event of a different type is brought about by divine\nvolition, such that a regular, law-like relation holds between two\ntypes of events, each exemplified by the occasional cause and its\neffect respectively. A common misunderstanding about occasionalism is\nthat if it is divine causality that anchors what occurs in the world,\nsuch grounding of natural events will render their occurrences rather\nirregular and haphazard. Perhaps it is the unpredictability of our own\nvolitional activity that precipitates this assumption that volitions\ndo not provide stable foundations for regularity. As we seen above,\nhowever, occasionalists accept the regularity of natural events as\nmuch as any realist about creaturely powers. The link that allows\noccasionalists to endorse regularity while grounding such regularity\nin divine volitions is their view that the divine volitions in\nquestion have a stable, law-like structure, thus being general in\ncharacter. Here again is Malebranche:\n\nGod acts by general volition, when he acts in consequence of general\nlaws that he has established. For example, I say that God acts in me\nby general volitions when he makes me feel pain when I am pricked [by\na pin], because, in consequence of the general and efficacious laws of\nthe union of soul and body that he has established, he makes me suffer\npain when my body is ill-disposed. I say, on the contrary, that God\nacts by particular volitions when the efficacy of his will is not\ndetermined by some general law to produce some effect\u2015 thus,\nsupposing that a body begins to move without being pushed by another,\nor without changes in the will of some mind, or without some other\ncreature who determines the efficacy of some general law; I say that\nGod would move this body by a particular volition. (OCM V\n147\u201348 /TNG 195)\n\n\nWhen my body is injured, I subsequently feel pain. This pain,\naccording to Malebranche, is due to the \u201cgeneral and efficacious\nlaw of the union of soul and body\u201d that God has established,\nand, thus, this injury is the occasional cause of the pain I feel.\nOccasional causes, as noted earlier, are just those events of a\ncertain type on the occurrence of which God wills to be bring about an\ninstance of distinct, yet commonly conjoined, event type, such that\nthese two types of events are naturally correlated with robust\nregularity. In fact, on the occasionalist scheme almost every event\nthat occurs in our world will turn out to be both an occasional cause\nand effect in that it will be part of the vast network of regularities\nthat we observe. That is, any given effect that follows from an\noccasional cause will, in turn, most likely be the occasional cause\nfor the following, subsequent effect. Thus, even on the occasionalist\npicture, there are hardly any events that fail to be part of this\nnetwork of causal regularities, and such regularity is possible\nbecause the overwhelming majority of events in the world are guided by\nGod\u2019s general volitions, which are determined by general laws that\nhave been established by God. Note that this last\nqualification\u2014that the general laws themselves are established\nby God\u2014marks a critical difference between an occasionalist like\nMalebranche and an Aristotelian essentialist about creaturely causal\npowers. For the latter holds that certain effects follow necessarily\nfrom the creature\u2019s causal essence, while Malebranche rejects such\ncausal essences and denies any such necessary connection that holds\ndirectly between a creaturely cause and\n effect.[36]\n\nWhat events are exceptions and do not fall under general volitions?\nThese are what the occasionalists typically identify as miraculous\nevents, which, for Malebranche, would be those cases wherein God acts\nby particular volitions. If an event occurs without its typical\npreceding occasion and in violation of the general law known to us,\nthen such an event we are able to judge as occurring due to God\nexercising his particular volition. Returning to Malebranche\u2019s\nown example, when \u201ca body begins to move without being pushed by\nanother, or without changes in the will of some mind,\u201d here God\ncan be said to move this body by a particular volition. However, even\nin such instances, it is important to note that we should not think\nthat God is rejecting or overpowering some built-in essences within\nthe creature and conjoining some event inherently foreign to them. In\nfact, as we have seen, one motivation behind the occasionalist project\nwas to avoid this picture of God having to act against natural\ntendencies in miraculous cases, a picture that occasionalist charged\nthe Aristotelian essentialists to be committed to. For the\noccasionalists, the general laws themselves are established by God\njust as the particular volitions are exercised by God, hence there is\nno struggle or conflict between divine volition and the results of\ndivine creation in either case. There is no need for God to overpower\nhis creation in cases of miraculous activity. Thus, on this\nunderstanding of occasional causes, we can see that any occasion in\nprinciple could be the antecedent event in God\u2019s exercise of a\nparticular volition, resulting in a miracle, and any antecedent event\nin actual miraculous events could have been conjoined to a general\nvolition. Creaturely states are at most occasions in that they are\ndevoid of causal natures or essences. \n\nGiven this understanding of occasional causation, occasionalism, as we\nnoted in the beginning, can be understood as a metaphysics of\ncausation that promotes a more discriminating attitude toward what are\ntypically taken to be causal interactions operative in this world. The\noccasionalist resists a blanket, univocal understanding of these\napparent causal interactions, and argues that we distinguish two types\nof relations in the world, that of genuine causation and that of\noccasional causation, wherein the latter relations are ultimately and\nfundamentally grounded in the former. \n",
