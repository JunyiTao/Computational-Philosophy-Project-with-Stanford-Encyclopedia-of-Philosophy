Not\nlong after his birth his parents returned to their hometown Xanthos in\nLycia, a maritime area of what is now southwest Turkey. He began his\neducation in Xanthos and moved from there to Alexandria (Egypt) to\npursue the study of rhetoric in order to become a lawyer, as was his\nfather. However, during a journey to Byzantium he discovered philosophy\nas his vocation. Back in Alexandria he studied Aristotle and\nmathematics. Marinus reports that the very gifted pupil easily learned\nall of Aristotle\u2019s logical writings by heart.\n\n\nIn 430\u2013431, 18 years old, Proclus moved to Athens, attracted by the\nfame of the Platonic School there. He studied for two years under the\ndirection of Plutarch (of Athens; to be distinguished from the\n1st\u20132nd c. philosopher/biographer), reading with\nhim Plato\u2019s Phaedo and Aristotle\u2019s De\nanima. After Plutarch\u2019s death in 432, Syrianus became\nthe head of the Academy. Proclus followed with him the usual curriculum\nof the school (going back to Iamblichus), reading first\nAristotle\u2019s works and after that entering the \u2018greater\nmysteries,\u2019 the Platonic dialogues. Under Syrianus, Proclus also\ncame into contact with the older traditions of wisdom such as the\ntheology of the Orphics and the Chaldaean Oracles. Among\nSyrianus\u2019 lost works we find a treatise On the harmony of\nOrpheus, Pythagoras and Plato with the Chaldaean Oracles. As the\nSuda lexicon attributes a work with this title also to Proclus, it is\nnot unlikely that he published Syrianus\u2019 treatise, adding\ncomments of his own. Since Syrianus and Proclus worked intensively\ntogether for six years, Proclus was strongly influenced by his\nteacher. On many occasions Proclus praises the philosophical\nachievements of his teacher and he never criticizes him. Because of\nthis, it is almost impossible to distinguish between Proclus\u2019\noriginal contribution and what he adopted from Syrianus.\n\n\nAfter Syrianus\u2019 death (437), Proclus succeeded as head of the\nAthenian school, and he kept this position for almost fifty years until\nhis death in 485. His tight schedule of the day, starting with a prayer\nto the sun at sunrise (repeated at noontime and at sunset), included\nlectures, reading seminars, discussions with students, and literary\nwork of his own. Besides his philosophical activities, Marinus also\nportrays Proclus as an experienced practitioner of theurgy\n(Life of Proclus, \u00a7 28\u201329; on theurgy\nsee below 3.6). The practice of these pagan rites could only be\ncontinued in the private sphere of the School\u2019s grounds. Though\nProclus was in Athens a highly respected philosopher and had some\nChristian students, he had to be prudent to avoid anti-pagan reactions.\nMarinus tells that he had to go into exile for about one year to Lydia\n(in Asia) to avoid difficulties (Life of Proclus \u00a7\n15).\n",
