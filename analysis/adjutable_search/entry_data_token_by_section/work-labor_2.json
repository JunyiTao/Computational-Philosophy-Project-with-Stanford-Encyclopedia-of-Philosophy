    "main_text": "The Value of Work || The Goods of Work\n2.1 The Goods of Work\n\nOn perhaps the narrowest conception of work\u2019s value, it only has\nexchange value. On this conception, work\u2019s value is\nmeasured purely in terms of the material goods it generates for the\nworker, either in monetary terms or in terms of work\u2019s products\n(growing one\u2019s own vegetables, for instance). To view work as\nhaving exchange value is to see its value as wholly extrinsic; there\nis no value to work as such, only value to be gained from what\none\u2019s work concretely produces. If work only has exchange value,\nthen work is solely a cost or a burden, never worth doing for its own\nsake. Echoing the Biblical tale of humanity\u2019s fall, this\nconception of work\u2019s value casts it as a curse foisted upon us\ndue to human limitations or inadequacies.\n\nBut work is often valued for other reasons. One powerful bit of\nevidence in favour of work\u2019s being valued for reasons unrelated\nto its exchange value comes from studies of (involuntary)\nunemployment. Unemployment usually adverse economic effects on\nworkers, inasmuch as it deprives them, at least temporarily, of\nincome. But prolonged unemployment also has measurable negative\neffects on individuals\u2019 health, both physical and mental (Calvo\net al 2015, Margerison-Zilko et al. 2016, Helliwell et al 2017), as\nwell as being among the most stressful of live events. (Holmes and\nRahe 1967). That being deprived of work is evidently so detrimental to\nindividual well-being indicates that work matters for many beyond a\npaycheck.\n\nMany of the goods of work are linked to the fact that work is nearly\nalways a social endeavour. As Cynthia Estlund (2003:7) observes,\n\u201cthe workplace is the single most important site of cooperative\ninteraction and sociability among adult citizens outside the\nfamily.\u201d Individuals thus seek out many social goods through\nwork. Gheaus and Herzog (2016) propose that in addition to providing\nus wages, work fulfills various social roles. For example, work is a\nprimary means by which individuals can achieve a sense of community.\nIn working with others, we can establish bonds that contribute to our\nsense of belonging and that enable us to contribute to a distinctive\nworkplace culture. In a similar vein, communitarian theorists often\nargue that work, by embedding us in shared practices or traditions, is\nessential to social life (Walzer 1983, Breen 2007). MacIntyre\n(1984:187) defines a practice as a \u201cany coherent and complex\nform of socially established cooperative activity through which goods\ninternal to that form of activity are realised in the course of trying\nto achieve those standards of excellence which are appropriate to, and\npartially definitive of, that form of activity.\u201d Those working\ntogether in (say) a bakery are cooperating to produce the goods\ninternal to that activity (bread), with the result that they extend\ntheir capacities and enrich their appreciation of the goods they\ncooperatively produce.\n\nMany philosophers have closely linked work\u2019s value to different\naspects of human rationality. For instance, philosophers inspired by\nthinkers such as Aristotle have underscored work\u2019s ability to\nallow us to perfect ourselves by developing and exercising our\nrational potential in worthwhile ways. On this picture, work is a\ncentral arena for the realization of our natures across our lifetimes\n(Clark 2017). Marxists typically agree that work allows us to develop\nand exercise our rational powers, but add that work\u2019s value also\nresides in how it enables us to make those powers visible by imparting\nhuman form to a natural world that would otherwise remain alien to us.\nHence, for Marxists, work is an expression of our active nature, a\npathway to self-realization inasmuch as work creates products that\n\u201cobjectify\u201d the human will. Work thus represents a\ncounterweight to the passive consumption characteristic of modern\nsocieties (Elster 1989, Sayers 2005).\n\nAnother value associated with work is meaningfulness.\nPhilosophical inquiry into meaningful work often parallels\nphilosophical inquiry into\n the meaning of life.\n One central dispute about meaningful work is whether it is\nfundamentally subjective (a matter of how a worker feels about her\nwork), fundamentally objective (a matter of the qualities of\none\u2019s work or of the products one makes), or both (Yeoman 2014,\nMichaelson 2021). Some accounts of meaningful work are broadly\nKantian, seeing meaningful work as grounded in the value of autonomy\n(Schwartz 1982, Bowie 1998, Roessler 2012). Such accounts judge work\nas meaningful to the extent that it is freely entered into, affords\nworkers opportunities to exercise their own independent judgment, and\nallows them to pursue ends of their own that are to some extent\ndistinct from the ends mandated by their employers. Other accounts\nlocate the meaningfulness of work in its potential to enhance our\ncapabilities, to manifest virtues such as pride or self-discipline, or\nto emotionally engage our sense of purpose (Beadle and Knight 2012,\nSvendsen 2015, Yeoman 2014, Veltman 2016).\n\nAt the same time, some argue that meaningful work is in turn a\nprecondition of other important goods. John Rawls, for example,\nproposed that a lack of opportunity for meaningful work undermines\nself-respect, where self-respect is the belief that our plan for our\nlives is both worth pursuing and attainable through our intentional\nefforts. Meaningful work, as Rawls understood it, involves enjoying\nthe exercise of our capacities, particularly our more complex\ncapacities. Given that meaningful work is a \u201csocial basis\u201d\nfor self-respect, a just and stable society may have to offer\nmeaningful work by serving as an \u201cemployer of last resort\u201d\nif such work is otherwise unavailable (Rawls 1996, Moriarty 2009).\n\nRecent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in the\ndignity of work. Christian thought, and Catholicism in\nparticular (John Paul II 1981), has long advocated that work manifests\nthe dignity inherent in human beings. The claim that \u201call work\nhas dignity,\u201d regardless of its nature or of how much social\nesteem it enjoys, rests on egalitarian ideals about labor, ideals\narticulated by Black American thinkers such as Booker T. Washington\nand Martin Luther King, Jr. As Washington expressed it, \u201cthere\nis as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem\u201d\n(Washington 1901:220). At the same time however, this tradition has\nalso deployed the notion of dignity as a critical concept, to\nhighlight labor injustice and to decry exploitative forms of work\n(including slavery) that fail to serve or uplift humanity (Washington\n1901: 148, King 2011: 171\u201372, Veltman 2016: 29\u201331). This\nposition thus seems to assert that work as such has dignity but that\nwork can also vary in its dignity depending on workers\u2019 economic\nconditions or social status. More recent philosophical scholarship on\nthe dignity of work has investigated its relationship to human rights.\nFor instance, Paolo Gilabert (2018) distinguishes between dignity as a\nstatus and dignity as a condition. Status dignity is grounded in\ncertain valuable capacities that individuals have, capacities that in\nturn that require workers be treated with respect and concern.\nCondition dignity is achieved when individuals are treated in\naccordance with the \u2018dignitarian\u2019 norms mandated by such\nrespect or concern. Gilabert\u2019s distinction may allow the\naffirmation both of the inherent dignity of work, inasmuch as work\ngives evidence of human capacities worthy of respect, and of the claim\nthat failing to provide decent working conditions is at odds with (but\ndoes not undermine) dignity.\n",
