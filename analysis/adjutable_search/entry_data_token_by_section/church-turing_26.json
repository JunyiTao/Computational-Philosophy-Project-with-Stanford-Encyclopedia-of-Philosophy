    "main_text": "The Church-Turing Thesis and the Limits of Machines || Two distinct theses\n5.1 Two distinct theses\n\nCan the universal Turing machine perfectly simulate the behavior of\neach and any machine? The Church-Turing thesis is sometimes\nregarded as providing a statement of the logical limits of machinery,\nto the effect that the universal Turing machine is the most general\nmachine possible (and so the answer to the question just posed is\nyes.) For example:\n\n\nThat there exists a most general formulation of machine and that it\nleads to a unique set of input-output functions has come to be called\nChurch\u2019s thesis. (Newell 1980: 150)\n\n\nYet the Church-Turing thesis is a thesis about the extent of\neffective methods (therein lies its mathematical importance).\nPutting this another way, the thesis concerns what a human\nbeing can achieve when calculating by rote, using paper and\npencil (absent contingencies such as boredom, death, or insufficiency\nof paper). What a human rote-worker can achieve, and what a machine\ncan achieve, may be different.\n\nGandy was perhaps the first to distinguish explicitly between\nTuring\u2019s thesis and the very different proposition that\nwhatever can be calculated by a machine can be calculated by a\nTuring machine (Gandy 1980). Gandy called this proposition\n\u201cThesis M\u201d. He pointed out that Thesis M is in fact false\nin the case of some \u201cmachines obeying Newtonian\nmechanics\u201d, where \u201cthere may be rigid rods of arbitrary\nlengths and messengers travelling with arbitrary large\nvelocities\u201d (1980: 145). He also pointed out that Thesis M fails\nto apply to what he calls \u201cessentially analogue machines\u201d\n(1980: 125). A most interesting question is whether Thesis M is true\nof all discrete (i.e., non-analogue) machines that are\nconsistent with the actual laws of physics. This question is\ndiscussed in\n Section 6.4.\n\nThesis M is imprecise, since Gandy never explicitly specified quite\nwhat he meant by \u201ccalculated by a machine\u201d. It is useful\nto state a more definite proposition that captures the spirit of\nThesis M. This might be called the strong Church-Turing\nthesis, but on balance it seems preferable to avoid that name,\nsince the proposition in question is very different from the\nChurch-Turing thesis of 1936. The proposition will be called the\n\u201cmaximality thesis\u201d.\n\nSome more terminology: A machine \\(m\\) will be said to\ngenerate (borrowing this word from Turing 1937: 153) a\ncertain function (e.g., \\(x\\) squared) if \\(m\\) can be set up so that,\nif \\(m\\) is presented with any of the function\u2019s arguments\n(e.g., 4), \\(m\\) will carry out some sequence of processing steps, at\nthe end of which \\(m\\) produces the corresponding value of the\nfunction (16 in the example). Mutatis mutandis for functions\nthat, like addition, demand more than one argument.\n\n\nMaximality thesis:\n\nAll functions that can be generated by machine are effectively\ncomputable.\n\n\n\u201cEffectively computable\u201d is a commonly used term: A\nfunction is said to be effectively computable if (and only if) there\nis an effective method for obtaining its values. When phrased in terms\nof effective computability, the Church-Turing thesis says: All\neffectively computable functions are Turing-machine computable.\n\nClearly the Church-Turing thesis and the maximality thesis are\ndifferent theses.\n",
