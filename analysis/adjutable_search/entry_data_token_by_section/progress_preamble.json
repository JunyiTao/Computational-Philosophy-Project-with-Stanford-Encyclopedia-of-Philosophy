    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical proponents of progress assert that the human condition\nhas improved over the course of history and will continue to improve.\nDoctrines of progress first appeared in 18th-century Europe and\nepitomize the optimism of that time and place.  Belief in progress\nflourished in the 19th century.  While skeptics of progress did exist\nalongside its supporters from the beginning, it was not until the 20th\ncentury that theorists backed away en masse from the notion.  Many\n20th-century thinkers rejected the notion of progress after horrendous\nevents such as the two World Wars, the Holocaust, and the use of\nnuclear weaponry.\n\n\nIn general, writings on progress tend to bear a close relationship to\nthe environment in which they were produced.  Because of the strong\nconnection between doctrines of progress and historical events, this\narticle is organized by time and place.  However, that principle of\norganization does not mean that each doctrine should not be assessed\non its own merits.  To help the reader, the next section briefly\nsummarizes the conceptual framework that is used throughout the rest\nof the article.\n\n",
