    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Self-Reference || Semantic Paradoxes\n1.1 Semantic Paradoxes\n\nParadoxes of self-reference have been known since antiquity. The\ndiscovery of the liar paradox is often credited to Eubulides the\nMegarian who lived in the 4th century BC. The liar paradox belongs to\nthe category of semantic paradoxes, since it is based on the\nsemantic notion of truth. Other well-known semantic paradoxes include\nGrelling\u2019s paradox, Berry\u2019s paradox, and Richard\u2019s\nparadox.\n\nGrelling\u2019s paradox involves a predicate defined as\nfollows. Say a predicate is heterological if it is not true\nof itself, that is, if it does not itself have the property it\nexpresses. Then the predicate \u201cGerman\u201d is heterological,\nsince it is not itself a German word, but the predicate\n\u201cdeutsch\u201d is not heterological. The question that leads to\nthe paradox is now:\n\nIs \u201cheterological\u201d heterological?\n\n\nIt is easy to see that we obtain a contradiction independently of\nwhether we answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to this\nquestion (the argument runs more or less like in the liar paradox).\nGrelling\u2019s paradox is self-referential, since the definition of\nthe predicate heterological refers to all predicates,\nincluding the predicate heterological itself. Definitions such as this\nwhich depends on a set of entities, at least one of which is the\nentity being defined, are called impredicative.\n\nBerry\u2019s paradox is another paradox based on an\nimpredicative definition, or rather, an impredicative description.\nSome phrases of the English language are descriptions of natural\nnumbers, for example, \u201cthe sum of five and seven\u201d is a\ndescription of the number 12. Berry\u2019s paradox arises when trying\nto determine the denotation of the following description: \n\nthe least number that cannot be referred to by a description\ncontaining less than 100 symbols.\n\n\nThe contradiction is that this description containing 93 symbols\ndenotes a number which, by definition, cannot be denoted by any\ndescription containing less than 100 symbols. The description is of\ncourse impredicative, since it implicitly refers to all\ndescriptions, including itself.\n\nRichard\u2019s paradox considers phrases of the English\nlanguage defining real numbers rather than natural numbers. For\nexample, \u201cthe ratio between the circumference and diameter of a\ncircle\u201d is a phrase defining the number \\(\\pi\\). Assume an\nenumeration of all such phrases is given (e.g. by putting them into\nlexicographical order). Now consider the phrase:\n\nthe real number whose \\(n\\)th decimal place is 1 whenever the\n\\(n\\)th decimal place of the number denoted by the \\(n\\)th\nphrase is 0; otherwise 0.\n\n\nThis phrase defines a real number, so it must be among the enumerated\nphrases, say number \\(k\\) in this enumeration. But, at the same\ntime, by definition, it differs from the number denoted by the\n\\(k\\)th phrase in the \\(k\\)th decimal place. Thus we have a\ncontradiction. The defining phrase is obviously impredicative. The\nparticular construction employed in this paradox is called\ndiagonalisation. Diagonalisation is a general construction\nand proof method originally invented by Georg Cantor (1891) to prove\nthe uncountability of the power set of the natural numbers. It was\nalso used as a basis for Cantor\u2019s paradox, one of the\nset-theoretic paradoxes to be considered next.\n",
