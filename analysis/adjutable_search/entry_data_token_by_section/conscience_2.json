    "main_text": "The epistemic function of conscience\n3. The epistemic function of conscience\n\nAlong with the previous, non-epistemic conception of conscience, we\ncan also understand conscience as having an epistemic function. In\nthis sense, conscience brings us some form of moral knowledge or moral\nbeliefs\u2014either in an absolute sense, e.g., knowledge of divine\nlaws, or in a relative sense, e.g., knowledge of social norms in\none\u2019s culture.\n\nThe epistemic role of conscience does not necessarily coincide with\nthe role of epistemic faculties or functions such as reason,\nintuitions, or senses. In particular, that conscience\n\u201cbrings\u201d us moral knowledge or beliefs does not\nnecessarily mean that it gives us direct access to the source\nof this knowledge or of these beliefs, as might be the case with\nreason, intuitions, or senses.\n\nThe knowledge we get from conscience, understood as possessing an\nepistemic function, is often conceived as mediated knowledge. This is\nnot surprising, since, as we have seen, conscience is mostly\nunderstood as inward looking, which presupposes that the knowledge to\nwhich it gives us access is already within us and that we\nacquired it through some other process not involving conscience. In\nfact, on many accounts, conscience does not generate its own moral\nprinciples. For example, the moral contents we discover within us can\nbe acquired through divine intervention, as is the case with the laws\nof nature which, according to Christians, God infuses in our heart. As\nwe are going to see in\n subsection 3.1\n here below, the understanding of conscience as having an epistemic\nfunction and as the recipient of mediated knowledge is not exclusive\nto religious views.\n\nOn other accounts of conscience, however, conscience does give us\ndirect access to moral knowledge, for example as an intuition\nabout what is good and what is bad.\n\nLet us examine the two accounts of the epistemic role of conscience in\nmore detail.\n",
