    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nThe impression through the twentieth century of Kant as a\nfundamentally secular philosopher was due in part to various\ninterpretative conventions (such as Strawson\u2019s \u201cprinciple\nof significance\u201d \u2013 Strawson 1966, 16) whereby the\nmeaningfulness and/or thinkability of the supersensible is denied, as\nwell as through an artifact of how Kant\u2019s philosophy religion is\nintroduced to most, namely through the widespread anthologization of\nhis objections to the traditional proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence.\n\nKant\u2019s philosophy in the pre-Critical period has been\ncharacterized variously as a progression from rationalism to\nempiricism to criticism (Paulsen 1963), the continued search for a\nmore proper method for metaphysics (De Vleeschauwer 1962), a\nreconciliation of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian ideas (Friedman\n1994) or of natural science and metaphysics (Sch\u00f6nfeld 2000; cf.\nAnderson 2015), and as an attempted articulation of a metaphysical\nalternative to Leibnizian \u201clogicism\u201d (i.e., the view that\n\u201canything that is not logically contradictory is possible\u201d\n(Stang 2016). But what nearly all of Kant\u2019s pre-Critical\nwritings have in common is the desire to frame a more adequate concept\nof God and of the relation of this being to the created universe. Thus\namong his earliest reflections we find a detailed sketch of a\nreligious outlook extracted from Alexander Pope\u2019s \u201cAn\nEssay on Man\u201d (1734) and a discussion, among other things, of\nwhy this position is philosophically superior to that of Gottfried\nWilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) and Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754).\n\nWithin Kant\u2019s Critical period, not only do we find powerful\ndefenses of religious belief in all three Critiques {1781, 1788,\n1790}, but a considerable share of Kant\u2019s work in the 1790s is\nalso devoted to the positive side of his philosophy of religion. This\nincludes his 1791 \u201cTheodicy\u201d essay, Religion within\nthe Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), \u201cThe End of All\nThings\u201d (1794), and the Conflict of the Faculties\n(1798). Moreover, his lectures on logic, Reflexionen and the\nJ\u00e4sche Logic present a robust account of the nature of religious\nbelief/faith [Glaube]. So, while Kant does deny the\npossibility of religious knowledge (as well as opinion), he\ncharacterizes this denial as necessary to safeguard faith, which he\nendorses as the proper mode of religious assent. One must, therefore,\nunderstand the negative elements in his philosophy of religion, such\nas his infamous objections to the traditional proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence, in this context. As stated in the B-Preface to the\nCritique of Pure Reason, a central goal of the Critical\nproject is to establish the limits to knowledge \u201cin order to\nmake room for faith\u201d (Bxxx).\n\nThroughout Kant\u2019s writings, we find ample discussions of\nreligious issues. These are, in many instances, clearly affirmative,\nthough they are often framed within objections to theoretical\nreason\u2019s encroachments into the domain that is instead proper to\nfaith. Although his discussions of God and immortality are familiar to\nmost Kantians, the Critical corpus moves well beyond just these.\nEspecially in the 1790s, we find detailed treatments of biblical\nhermeneutics, miracles, revelation, as well as many distinctively\nChristian doctrines such as Original Sin, the Incarnation, Vicarious\nAtonement, and the Trinity.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the many positive elements of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy of religion have been eclipsed by its initial negative\nmoments, moments not meant to oppose religion, but rather reflective\nof the Lutheranism (or more precisely, the anti-liturgical Lutheran\nPietism) of his youth. Just as with Luther\u2019s own negative\npolemics against religious despotism and scholastic arcana, we see in\nKant a parallel dialectic, where he, rather than opposing religion,\nsought to free it from the \u201cmonopoly of the schools\u201d and\nset it on a footing suitable to \u201cthe common human\nunderstanding\u201d (Bxxxii). Hence, as we will discuss through this\nentry, the statement that Kant sought out the limits to knowledge\n[Wissen] in order to \u201cmake room for faith\n[Glaube]\u201d (Bxxx), is not an empty bromide, but rather\nthe key anthem for his overall philosophy of religion.\n",
