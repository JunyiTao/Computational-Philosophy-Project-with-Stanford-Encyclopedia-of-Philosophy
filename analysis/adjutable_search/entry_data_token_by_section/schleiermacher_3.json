    "main_text": "Hermeneutics (i.e., Theory of Interpretation)\n4. Hermeneutics (i.e., Theory of Interpretation)\n\nSome of Schleiermacher\u2019s most important philosophical work\nconcerns the theories of interpretation (\u201chermeneutics\u201d)\nand translation. Friedrich Schlegel was an immediate influence on his\nthought here. Their ideas on these subjects began to take shape in the\nlate 1790s, when they lived together in the same house in Berlin for a\ntime. Many of their ideas are shared, and it is often unclear which of\nthe two men was the (more) original source of a given idea. But since\nSchlegel\u2019s surviving treatments of these subjects are much less\ndetailed and systematic than Schleiermacher\u2019s, the latter\ninevitably take on prime importance.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theories of interpretation and translation rest\nsquarely on three of the Herder-inspired doctrines in the philosophy\nof language that were described above:\n (4)\n thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by, or even identical\nwith, language;\n (5)\n meaning is word-usage; and\n (7)\n there are deep linguistic and conceptual-intellectual differences\nbetween people. Doctrine\n (7)\n poses a severe challenge to both interpretation and translation, and\nit is the main task of Schleiermacher\u2019s theories to cope with\njust this challenge. Schleiermacher\u2019s most original doctrine in\nthe philosophy of language, doctrine\n (8)\n (semantic holism), is also highly relevant in this connection, for,\nas Schleiermacher recognizes, semantic holism greatly exacerbates the\nchallenge to interpretation and translation that is posed by\n (7).\n\nSchleiermacher lectured on hermeneutics frequently between 1805 and\n1833. The following are his main principles:\n\n(a) Hermeneutics is strictly the theory of understanding\nlinguistic communication\u2014as contrasted, not equated, with\nexplicating, applying, or translating it.\n\n(b) Hermeneutics should be a universal discipline\u2014i.e.,\none that applies equally to all subjects areas (such as the Bible,\nlaw, and literature), to oral as well as to written language, to\nmodern texts as well as to ancient ones, to works in one\u2019s own\nlanguage as well as to works in foreign languages, and so forth.\n\n(c) In particular, the interpretation of sacred texts such as the\nBible is included within it. This may not rely on special\nprinciples, such as divine inspiration (either of the author or of the\ninterpreter).\n\n(d) Interpretation is a much more difficult task than is generally\nrealized: contrary to a common misconception that \u201cunderstanding\noccurs as a matter of course\u201d, in fact \u201cmisunderstanding\noccurs as a matter of course, and so understanding must be willed and\nsought at every point\u201d (HHM 109\u2013110;\nHC 21\u201322). (This position derives from\nSchleiermacher\u2019s version of principle\n (7):\n deep linguistic and conceptual-intellectual diversity.)\n\nHow, then, is interpretation to be accomplished?\n\n(e) It is essential to distinguish clearly between the question of the\nmeaning of a text or discourse and the question of its\ntruth. If an interpreter assumes that a text or discourse\nmust be true, this will often lead to serious misinterpretation.\n\n(f) Before the interpretation proper of a text or discourse can even\nbegin, the interpreter must acquire a good knowledge of its historical\ncontext. (The suggestion found in some of the secondary literature\nthat Schleiermacher thinks that historical context is\nirrelevant to interpretation is absurd.)\n\n(g) Interpretation proper always has two sides: one linguistic, the\nother psychological. Linguistic interpretation\u2019s task (which\nrests on principle\n (5))\n lies in inferring from evidence that consists in particular actual\nuses of words to the rules that are governing them, i.e., to their\nusages, and thus to their meanings; psychological interpretation\ninstead focuses on an author\u2019s psychology. Linguistic\ninterpretation is mainly concerned with what is common or shared in a\nlanguage; psychological interpretation mainly with what is distinctive\nto a particular author.\n\n(h) Schleiermacher implies several reasons why an interpreter needs to\ncomplement linguistic interpretation with psychological in this way.\nFirst, he sees such a need as arising from the deep linguistic and\nconceptual-intellectual distinctiveness of individuals. This\ndistinctiveness at the level of individuals leads to the problem for\nlinguistic interpretation that the actual uses of words that are\navailable to serve as evidence from which to infer an author\u2019s\nexact usage or meaning will usually be relatively few in number and\npoor in contextual variety\u2014a problem which an appeal to\nauthorial psychology can help solve by providing additional clues.\nSecond, an appeal to the author\u2019s psychology is also required in\norder to resolve ambiguities at the level of linguistic meaning that\narise in particular contexts (i.e., even after the range of meanings\navailable to the author for the word(s) in question is known). Third,\nin order fully to understand a linguistic act one needs to know not\nonly its linguistic meaning but also what more recent philosophers\nhave called its \u201cillocutionary force\u201d or intention. For\nexample, if I encounter a stranger by a frozen lake who says to me,\n\u201cThe ice is thin over there\u201d, in order fully to understand\nhis utterance I need to know not only its linguistic meaning (which in\nthis case is clear) but also whether the utterance is being made as a\nfactual observation, a threat, a joke, or whatnot. (Schleiermacher\nhimself places most emphasis on the first of these three\nconsiderations. However, if, as he does, one wants to argue that\ninterpretation needs to invoke psychology generally, and if,\nas I hinted earlier, linguistic and conceptual-intellectual\ndistinctiveness is not in fact the pervasive phenomenon that\nSchleiermacher usually takes it to be, then it is arguably the latter\ntwo considerations that should be considered the more fundamental\nones.)\n\n(i) Interpretation also requires two different methods: a\n\u201ccomparative\u201d method (i.e., a method of plain induction),\nwhich Schleiermacher sees as predominating on the linguistic side of\ninterpretation, where it takes the interpreter from the particular\nuses of a word to the rule for use that governs them all; and a\n\u201cdivinatory\u201d method (i.e., a method of tentative, fallible\nhypothesis based on but also going well beyond the empirical evidence\navailable; the etymology to keep in mind here is not so much Latin\ndivinus, which would point toward prophecy, but rather French\ndeviner, to guess or conjecture), which he sees as\npredominating on the psychological side of interpretation. (The\nwidespread conception in the secondary literature that\n\u201cdivination\u201d is for Schleiermacher a process of\npsychological self-projection into texts contains a grain of truth, in\nthat he does think that interpretation requires some measure\nof psychological common ground between interpreter and interpretee,\nbut is nonetheless basically mistaken.)\n\n(j) Ideal interpretation is of its nature a holistic activity (this\nprinciple in part rests on, but also goes well beyond,\nSchleiermacher\u2019s semantic holism). In particular, any\ngiven piece of text needs to be interpreted in light of the whole text\nto which it belongs, and both need to be interpreted in light of the\nbroader language in which they are written, their larger historical\ncontext, a broader pre-existing genre, the author\u2019s whole\ncorpus, and the author\u2019s overall psychology. Such holism\nintroduces a pervasive circularity into interpretation, for,\nultimately, interpreting these broader items in its turn depends on\ninterpreting such pieces of text. Schleiermacher does not see this\ncircle as vicious, however. Why not? His solution is not that all of\nthese tasks should be accomplished simultaneously\u2014for that would\nfar exceed human capacities. Rather, it essentially lies in the (very\nplausible) thought that understanding is not an all-or-nothing matter\nbut instead something that comes in degrees, so that it is\npossible to make progress toward full understanding in a piecemeal\nway. For example, concerning the relation between a piece of text and\nthe whole text to which it belongs, Schleiermacher recommends that we\nfirst read through and interpret as best we can each of the parts of\nthe text in turn in order thereby to arrive at an approximate overall\ninterpretation of the text, and that we then apply this approximate\noverall interpretation in order to refine our initial interpretations\nof each of the particular parts, which in turn gives us an improved\noverall interpretation, which can then be re-applied toward still\nfurther refinement of the interpretations of the parts, and so on\nindefinitely.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s debts to Herder in this theory of\ninterpretation extend well beyond the framework-principles\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7)\n mentioned earlier. Indeed, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory as it has\njust been described is almost identical to Herder\u2019s. Some of the\ncommon ground here is admittedly due to the fact that they were both\ninfluenced by the same predecessors, especially J.A. Ernesti. But\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory owes the two central moves (often\nwrongly thought to have been original with Schleiermacher) of\nsupplementing \u201clinguistic\u201d with\n\u201cpsychological\u201d interpretation and of identifying\n\u201cdivination\u201d as the predominant method of the latter\nexclusively to Herder. (Herder had already made these two moves,\nespecially in On Thomas Abbt\u2019s Writings [1768] and\nOn the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul [1778].)\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory as it has just been described in essence\nmerely draws together and systematizes ideas that already lay\nscattered through a number of Herder\u2019s works.\n\nThere are some significant exceptions to this rule of continuity,\nhowever\u2014respects in which Schleiermacher\u2019s theory deviates\nfrom Herder\u2019s. But it is precisely here that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory tends to become philosophically\nproblematic. To begin with two deviations that are not\nproblematic, but instead advantageous: First, as was previously\nmentioned, Schleiermacher exacerbates the challenge to interpretation\nthat principle\n (7)\n already poses by introducing principle\n (8),\n semantic holism. Second, Schleiermacher\u2019s theory explicitly\nintroduces principle (b), the ideal of the universality of\nhermeneutics. This principle is very much in the spirit of\nHerder\u2019s theory, but does go beyond its letter. (There were,\nhowever, some clearer precedents for it\u2014for example, in van der\nHardt, Chladenius, Pfeiffer, Grosch, and Meier.) Turning now to\ndeviations that are problematic, we have already noted\nseveral examples of such problematic deviations concerning the exact\nforce of the three principles in the philosophy of language that\nunderpin Schleiermacher\u2019s theory of interpretation, principles\n (4),\n (5), and\n (7).\n But the following are some further examples. Whereas Herder rightly\nemphasizes the vital importance in interpretation of correctly\nidentifying a work\u2019s genre, and also the great difficulty of\ndoing so in many cases, especially due to the constant changes in\ngenres that take place and the consequent pervasive temptation falsely\nto assimilate unfamiliar genres to more familiar ones, Schleiermacher\npays relatively little attention to this subject. Again, unlike\nHerder, Schleiermacher, especially in his later work, more closely\nspecifies psychological interpretation as a process of identifying,\nand tracing the necessary development of, a single authorial\n\u201cseminal decision [Keimentschlu\u00df]\u201d that\nlies behind a work and unfolds itself as the work in a necessary\nfashion. However, this seems an unhelpful move, for how many works are\nactually composed, and hence properly interpretable, in such a way?\nAgain, whereas Herder includes not only an author\u2019s linguistic\nbehavior but also his non-linguistic behavior among the evidence that\nis relevant to psychological interpretation, Schleiermacher normally\ninsists on a restriction to the former. But this too seems misguided;\nfor example, the Marquis de Sade\u2019s recorded acts of\ncruelty seem no less potentially relevant to establishing the (as we\nnow put it) sadistic side of his psychological make-up, and hence to\ninterpreting his texts accurately, than his cruel statements. Again,\nunlike Herder, Schleiermacher regards the central role of\n\u201cdivination\u201d, or hypothesis, in interpretation as a ground\nfor sharply distinguishing interpretation from natural science, and\nhence for classifying it as an art rather than a science. However, he\nshould arguably instead have seen it as a ground for considering\ninterpretation and natural science similar. (His mistake here\nwas caused by a false assumption that natural science works by a\nmethod of plain induction\u2014i.e., roughly: this first a\nis F, this second a is F, this third\na is F, \u2026 therefore all as are\nF\u2014rather than by hypothesis.)\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory also tends to downplay, obscure, or miss\ncertain important points concerning interpretation that Friedrich\nSchlegel had already made. Schlegel\u2019s treatment of hermeneutic\nmatters\u2014in texts such as his Philosophy of Philology\n(1797) and the Athenaeum Fragments\n(1798\u20131800)\u2014largely resembles Schleiermacher\u2019s. But\nit also includes the following four points which are either less\nemphatic, obscured, or altogether missing in Schleiermacher: (i)\nSchlegel notes that texts (at least superior ones) often express\nunconscious meanings in addition to their conscious ones:\n\u201cEvery excellent work \u2026 aims at more than it knows\u201d\n(On Goethe\u2019s Meister [1798] [PJ\n2:177]). Schleiermacher sometimes seems to imply a similar view, most\nfamously in his doctrine that the interpreter should aim to understand\nan author better than he understood himself. However, given\nSchleiermacher\u2019s general skepticism about the unconscious, he\nprobably means little more by this than that the interpreter should\nachieve an explicit knowledge of linguistic rules that the author\nhimself only grasped implicitly. By contrast, Schlegel\u2019s version\nof such a position is more radical, envisaging indeed an\n\u201cinfinite depth\u201d of meaning that is largely unknown to the\nauthor himself. (ii) Schlegel emphasizes that a work sometimes\nexpresses important meanings, not explicitly in any of its parts, but\nrather through the way in which these are put together to form a\nwhole. This is a very important point. Schleiermacher perhaps in a\nway makes it as well, but if so, then only as incorporated into\nand obscured by his more dubious doctrine of the \u201cseminal\ndecision\u201d. (iii) Unlike Schleiermacher, Schlegel emphasizes that\nworks typically contain confusions that the interpreter needs not only\nto identify but also to explain:\n\n\nIt is not enough that one understand the actual sense of a confused\nwork better than the author understood it. One must also oneself be\nable to know, characterize, and even construe the\nconfusion even down to its very principles. (KFSA\n18:63)\n\n\nThis is another very important point. (iv) Schlegel recognizes that\nnot only linguistic texts and discourse have meanings that require\ninterpretation, but also non-linguistic art (instrumental music,\nsculpture, painting, architecture, and so on), and he therefore covers\nthis in his theory of interpretation as well. Schleiermacher fails to\ndo so, instead confining himself to linguistic texts and discourse.\nThis is a serious omission.\n\nDespite these significant shortcomings in the details of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics, it at least had the advantages\nover Herder\u2019s and Schlegel\u2019s versions of the discipline of\nbeing consolidated, systematic, and somewhat comprehensive.\nSchleiermacher\u2019s pupil August Boeckh, an eminent classical\nphilologist, subsequently developed a largely faithful and even more\nsystematic re-articulation of Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics in\nlectures that he delivered during the period 1809\u20131866 and which\nwere eventually published posthumously as his Encyclopedia and\nMethodology of the Philological Sciences (1877). (Boeckh\u2019s\nonly major departure from Schleiermacher was his devotion of a new\npart of the discipline to genre, very much in the spirit of Herder and\nSchlegel.) Through the combined influence of Schleiermacher\u2019s\nand Boeckh\u2019s presentations of it, Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics achieved something very much like the status of the\nofficial hermeneutical methodology of nineteenth-century classical and\nbiblical scholarship.\n",
