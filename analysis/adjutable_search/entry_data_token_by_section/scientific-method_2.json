Logic of method and critical responses\n\nThe quantum and relativistic revolutions in physics in the early\n20th century had a profound effect on methodology.\nConceptual foundations of both theories were taken to show the\ndefeasibility of even the most seemingly secure intuitions about\nspace, time and bodies. Certainty of knowledge about the natural world\nwas therefore recognized as unattainable. Instead a renewed empiricism\nwas sought which rendered science fallible but still rationally\njustifiable.\n\nAnalyses of the reasoning of scientists emerged, according to which\nthe aspects of scientific method which were of primary importance were\nthe means of testing and confirming of theories. A distinction in\nmethodology was made between the contexts of discovery and\njustification. The distinction could be used as a wedge between the\nparticularities of where and how theories or hypotheses are arrived\nat, on the one hand, and the underlying reasoning scientists use\n(whether or not they are aware of it) when assessing theories and\njudging their adequacy on the basis of the available evidence. By and\nlarge, for most of the 20th century, philosophy of science\nfocused on the second context, although philosophers differed on\nwhether to focus on confirmation or refutation as well as on the many\ndetails of how confirmation or refutation could or could not be\nbrought about. By the mid-20th century these attempts at\ndefining the method of justification and the context distinction\nitself came under pressure. During the same period, philosophy of\nscience developed rapidly, and from\n section 4\n this entry will therefore shift from a primarily historical treatment\nof the scientific method towards a primarily thematic one.\n",
