    "main_text": "Origins\n1. Origins\n\nPublic justification arose to resolve problems for social contract\ntheory.\n\nClassical social contract theorists grounded political legitimacy on\nconsent. The chief social contract theorists were Thomas Hobbes, John\nLocke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. They had different\nstandards of consent; the first three oscillated between an empirical\nand a normative standard. The empirical standard draws on actual\nmental states: consent justifies political power because it draws on\neach party\u2019s beliefs and values. The normative standard draws on\nsomehow rational mental states: we appeal not to what people believe\nand value but what they have reason to believe and value. Political\npower is justified when grounded in what parties ideally affirm. In\nthe latter case, we sometimes speak of hypothetical consent as a proxy\nfor rational justification.\n\nIn general, empirical standards gave way to normative standards.\nTheorists wanted to legitimize uses of power that contradict what\npeople actually will. By Kant\u2019s time, actual consent views had\ndisappeared. Hypothetical consent was the state of play. The normative\nstandard of legitimacy had won out.\n\nAll four theorists recognize the diversity of private judgments about\njustice. All allowed moral judgments to diverge for any number of\nreasons. They all concluded that private judgment could not ground\nlegitimacy for a diverse public. As Rawls (2005, vii) would put it,\nthese theorists recognized reasonable pluralism. Citizens who reason\nfreely will disagree about fundamental values and principles. Contract\ntheorists concluded that justifications for political power had to\nrespect diverse judgments. So justification could not rest on one\nspecific set of beliefs and values. A public justification had to be\nimpartial, at least among respectable but diverse viewpoints.\n\nThe idea of public justification surfaced in Kant\u2019s work but\nthen entered hibernation for a century. Social contract theory gave\nway to utilitarianism, Hegelianism, and Marxism. These three schools\nof thought rejected the idea of a social contract, though they have\ndistinct reasons for doing so. The social contract tradition revived\nonly after World War II, first in the United States.\n\nOne of the first new forms of social contract theory was\ncontractarianism, which justifies coercive institutions through\ninstrumental rationality: justified political arrangements are\nrational bargains among parties for dividing social resources. The\nfirst contemporary contract theorists were economists like John\nHarsanyi and James Buchanan. But neo-Hobbesian philosophers pursued a\nsimilar project, especially David Gauthier, Jean Hampton, and Gregory\nKavka.\n\nBut the dominant strand of the new contract tradition was Kantian.\nHere John Rawls leads the pack in A Theory of Justice and\nlater in Political Liberalism. Political Liberalism\nfeatures public justification as this entry understands the concept.\nRawls first understood public justification as a hypothetical\ncontract: idealized members of the public choose principles of\njustice. Only Political Liberalism articulates the challenge\nthat reasonable pluralism poses for political legitimacy. For Rawls,\nthe public must adopt principles justified for them despite their\ndifferences. Political power is legitimate only when exercised in\naccord with publicly justified norms. (Some theorists use\n\u201cjustified\u201d and \u201cpublicly justified\u201d as\nsynonyms. See 2.3 below.)\n\nThe modern idea of public justification thus only comes into full view\nin the early 1990s. Works on public reason and justification published\nin rapid succession. They produced a new tradition of political\nthought that flourishes today; indeed, public justification is now a\ncore concept in political philosophy. Yet the idea admits significant\nvariation, so we now examine those differences.\n",
