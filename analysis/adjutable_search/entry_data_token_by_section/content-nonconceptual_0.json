    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAlthough some of the themes in current discussions of nonconceptual\ncontent have surfaced at various times in recent philosophical\nthinking (within the philosophy of perception, see, e.g., Dretske\n1969, 1981. Within philosophy of cognitive science, see, e.g., Stich\n1978), the notion of nonconceptual content was explicitly introduced\ninto analytical philosophy by Gareth Evans (Evans 1982). As part of\nhis general discussion of the role of information-links in making\npossible demonstrative and other types of identification, Evans\ndevelops the idea that the information yielded by the perceptual\nsystems (including somatic proprioception) is nonconceptual. This\nnonconceptual information, he argues, is initially unconscious but\nbecomes conscious when it serves as input to a thinking,\nconcept-applying, and reasoning system.\n\nEvans is not always clear whether he understands nonconceptual content\nto be a personal level or a subpersonal level phenomenon. And, in\nfact, it seems that Evans\u2019s conception of nonconceptual content\nis in at least one important way deeply antithetical to that currently\ndiscussed. Whereas much contemporary discussion of nonconceptual\ncontent is focused on the content of conscious perceptual\nstates, it looks very much as if Evans understands perceptual states\nwith nonconceptual content as being non-conscious until the\nsubject\u2019s conceptual abilities are brought to bear on them\n(Campbell 2005). Nonetheless, the general idea that there might be\nways of representing the world independent of the thinker\u2019s\nconceptual capacities has inspired other philosophers. An early,\npersonal level application of the notion is Tim Crane\u2019s paper on\nthe waterfall illusion (Crane 1988a. An illustration of the waterfall\nillusion, also known as the motion aftereffect illusion, can be found\n here).\n Crane argues that the waterfall illusion presents an experience with\na contradictory content that hence cannot have a conceptual\ncontent\u2014since conceptual contents must be consistent. This claim\nhas provoked some debate (Mellor 1988, Crane 1988b).\n\nEarly development of the notion of nonconceptual content came\nprimarily from philosophers connected with the University of Oxford\nand working within a broadly Fregean tradition. Christopher Peacocke,\nin a series of papers and then in his book on concepts (Peacocke\n1992), argued that the fineness of grain of perceptual experience\noutstrips the conceptual capacities of the perceiver (more on the\nfineness of grain argument in section\n 4.1).\n He offered a detailed theoretical framework for understanding the\nnonconceptual content of perceptual experience, which he termed\nscenario content. A rather different account of the nature of\nperceptual experience in nonconceptual terms was provided by Adrian\nCussins (Cussins 1990), who suggested that we should understand the\nnonconceptual content of experience in essentially ability-based\nterms. Cussins argued that this personal level notion of nonconceptual\ncontent is naturally complemented at the subpersonal level by a\nconnectionist cognitive architecture. Michael Martin applied the\nnotion of nonconceptual content to the study of memory (Martin 1992).\nRecent applications of the notion of nonconceptual content have\nfocused on the relation between perception and action (Hurley 1998)\nand the analysis of conscious experience (Tye 1995, 2000).\n\nOne thesis that might be held about nonconceptual content is that a\nthinker can represent the world nonconceptually without possessing\nany concepts at all. This was termed the Autonomy Thesis by\nPeacocke, who offers an argument against it in his (1992). This\nargument was challenged by Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez\n(Berm\u00fadez 1994) in favor of a notion of autonomous\nnonconceptual content that can be used to explain the behavior of\nnonlinguistic creatures. Peacocke was initially unconvinced by this\nline of argument (Peacocke 1994), but subsequently changed his mind\n(Peacocke 2002). Berm\u00fadez further deployed the notion of\nautonomous nonconceptual content in exploring primitive nonlinguistic\nforms of self-consciousness (Berm\u00fadez 1998). (More on the\nAutonomy Thesis in section\n 6.)\n\nThe notion of nonconceptual content has also been utilized in\nspecifying the representational contents of subpersonal states, such\nas those involved in the early stages of visual processing. Such\nstates, it is suggested, have representational contents and yet it is\nunlikely that the subject undergoing those states has the concepts\nutilized in a theoretical description of the contents of those states.\n(More on the nonconceptual character of subpersonal states in section\n 4.2.)\n Additionally, the notion of nonconceptual content has been utilized\nin the explanation of the behavior of nonlinguistic creatures or those\nthat do not employ concepts. Since, ex hypothesi, such\norganisms do not have conceptual capacities, if we are to attribute to\nthem states with representational contents at all the only contents\navailable to us are nonconceptual representational contents. (More on\nthe explanation of the behavior of nonlinguistic creatures in section\n 4.3.)\n\nThe most extensive discussion of the notion of nonconceptual content\nhas been in the philosophy of perception. Many have suggested that a\ncorrect specification of the representational contents of perception\nneed not be limited to concepts possessed by the perceiver. In other\nwords, a specification of the content of perception can be sensitive\nto how an organism perceptually represents its environment even though\nit utilizes concepts the organism need not possess. This claim is\nsupported by a variety of different considerations, some of which\nconcern the distinctive features of the phenomenology of perception\nand some which concern perception\u2019s distinctive epistemic role.\n(See section\n 4.1\n for the debate about the nonconceptual content of perception.)\n\nSome have objected to Evans\u2019s original characterization of the notion\non the grounds that whether or not a correct specification of the\nrepresentational content of some mental states is constrained by the\nconcepts possessed by the subject speaks only to the conditions a\nsubject must satisfy in order to undergo such states, rather than to\nthe nature of the state\u2019s representational content (e.g., Heck\n2000). This has led to a distinction between two forms of\nnonconceptualism\u2014\u201cstate\u201d-nonconceptualism and\n\u201ccontent\u201d-nonconceptualism. The former is concerned with the\nconditions one must meet in order to undergo a state with a given\ncontent, i.e., whether or not one must possess the concepts involved\nin specifying that content, whereas the latter is concerned with the\nnature of a mental state\u2019s content. Nonetheless, as we discuss below,\nthere is good reason to suppose that the distinction collapses, and\nthat the two forms of nonconceptualism are mutually-entailing. (See\nsection 3 for the purported\ndistinction between state and content nonconceptualism.)\n",
