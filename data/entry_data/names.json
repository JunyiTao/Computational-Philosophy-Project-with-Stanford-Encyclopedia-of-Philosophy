    "main_text": "\n1. Syntax\n\nThe Cambridge Grammar of English distinguishes the syntactic category\nof proper name from that of proper\nnoun (Payne & Huddleston 2002: 516). A\nproper noun is a word-level unit of the category noun, while\na proper name is a type of noun phrase. So, for example, the\nproper name \u201cAlice Walker\u201d consists of two proper\nnouns: \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cWalker\u201d. A proper\nname (the noun phrase) may also\u2014and often\ndoes\u2014consist of a single proper noun, just as a verb phrase may\nconsist of a lone verb. Hence, the sentence \u201cAlice sleeps\u201d\nis comprised of a noun phrase/proper name and a verb phrase; the noun\nphrase contains a single proper noun, and the verb phrase consists of\na lone verb. Its analysis into syntactic constituents would look like\nthis:  \n\\[\\left[_{\\textsf{S}} \\left[_{\\textsf{PName}} \\left[_{\\textsf{PNoun}}\n\\textsf{Alice} \\right]\\right] \\left[_{\\textsf{VP}} \\left[_{\\textsf{V}}\n\\textsf{sleeps}\\right]\\right]\\right]\\]\n\n\nProper names may contain other parts of speech, too: \u201cBrooklyn\nBridge\u201d places the common noun \u201cBridge\u201d alongside\nthe proper noun \u201cBrooklyn\u201d. \u201cThe Raritan\nRiver\u201d includes the determiner \u201cthe\u201d. \u201cThe\nBronx\u201d combines a determiner and a proper noun. Finally,\n\u201cthe Golden Gate Bridge\u201d is a proper name with no proper\nnouns in it at all.\n\nProper names occur in different formats depending on the sort of thing\nnamed (Carroll 1985). For instance, official names of persons in many\ncultures consist of (at least) first and last names, themselves proper\nnouns. Names of bridges have an optional definite article and often\ninclude the common noun \u201cbridge\u201d. We have bridge names\nthat embed other proper names like \u201cThe George Washington\nBridge\u201d. We can even imagine structurally ambiguous names, such\nas \u201cthe New New York Public Library\u201d.\n\nTo accommodate the full range of proper names, we need one more\nsyntactic category. Following the Cambridge English Grammar once again\nfor convenience, a noun phrase consists of an optional determiner\nfollowed by a nominal phrase. Thus in the noun\nphrase \u201cthe man who was Thursday\u201d, the nominal phrase\nconstituent is \u201cman who was Thursday\u201d. If we assume a\nsimilar construction for proper names, then \u201cthe Raritan\nRiver\u201d has a constituent \u201cRaritan River\u201d (itself\nmade up of the proper noun \u201cRaritan\u201d and the common noun\n\u201cRiver\u201d). We will call the constituent that is the\ncomplement of the (optional) determiner in a proper name a proper\nnominal. Thus the full analysis of the proper\nname \u201cAlice\u201d looks like this:  \n\\[[_{\\textsf{PName}} [_{\\textsf{PNom}} [_{\\textsf{PNoun}} \\textsf{Alice} ]]]\\]\n\n\nNames are standardly categorized as definite\nnoun phrases (Mulkern 1996; Abbott 2002). They can occur with markers\nof definiteness, such as the definite article \u201cthe\u201d in\nEnglish (though in some languages, such as Samoan, proper names\nobligatorily occur with a special proprial\narticle, distinguished from the ordinary definite article).\nSince definite descriptions also belong under the general head of\ndefinite noun phrases (along with pronouns and demonstratives), this\nevidence is used to support views on which names are a type of\ndefinite description (Sloat 1969; Larson & Segal 1995:\n354\u2013355; Elbourne 2005), but is consistent with names forming\ntheir own species of definite.\n\nProper nominals (proper names without their determiner) can modify\nother nouns, as in \u201ca Bronx resident\u201d. They can also occur\nas the restrictor of determiners other than \u201cthe\u201d, as in\n\u201cevery University of California, from Berkeley to Santa\nCruz\u201d. Some (Sloat 1969; Burge 1973) see the predicate meanings\nof proper nominals as primary, and attempt to generate the meaning of\nthe more common argumental occurrences of proper names from them.\nHowever, it is also reasonable to regard predicative proper nominals\nas on a par with \u201ccoerced\u201d expressions such as the verb\n\u201cto google\u201d (Leckie 2013; Schoubye 2017), or as having a\nmeaning separately bestowed by convention (Johnson 2018).\n\nIs there just one proper name \u201cAlice,\u201d or are there many\nhomonyms, one for each person or thing so named? It is tempting to\ninfer the uniqueness of the name, on syntactic grounds, from the\nuniqueness of the proper noun. Arguably the same noun recurs in the\ndifferent names \u201cAlice Waters\u201d and \u201cAlice\nWalker\u201d, as well as in the phrase \u201ctwo famous\nAlices\u201d (though see Sainsbury 2015 and Gray 2015 on the latter).\nAnd if the name \u201cAlice\u201d is a complex expression built up\nfrom a unique noun, then presumably there should be only one such\nexpression built up in that particular way.\n\nOn the other hand, the name \u201cAlice\u201d can be used to refer\nto many different people. If the same syntactic item is responsible in\neach case, this profligacy must be explained. Supposing the name is\nmeaningful (the topic of the next section), it is either (massively)\nambiguous, or else has the sort of meaning that constrains, without\ndetermining, the reference of a specific utterance. It might\nalternatively have a general meaning that identifies a different\nreferent when uttered in different contexts (in the manner of\nindexicals like \u201chere\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d).\n\nIf instead there are many homonyms, then each may be allocated its own\nconvention, independently determining its proper referent (see Kripke\n1980: 7\u20138; Kaplan 1990). It is reasonable to see the uniquely\ndenoting name as a technical innovation responding to a specific\ntheoretical need in semantics. Alternative terminology employed with\nthe same goal in mind, but a greater reluctance to embrace genuine\nhomonymy, includes that of the particular \u201cuse\u201d of a name\n(Strawson 1950), \u201cname-using practice\u201d (Evans 1982),\n\u201cnaming convention\u201d (Matushansky 2008: 592; Recanati\n1997), and even \u201cdiscourse entity\u201d (Cumming 2014).\n\nFor the exposition to come, we will not presume the issue settled, and\nwill speak, at different times, of the many homonymous specific\nnames \u201cAlice\u201d, as well as the\nunique generic name \u201cAlice\u201d.\n2. Semantics\n2.1 Meaning and Extension\n\nAs well as having a range of entities to which it applies, the common\nnoun \u201cbachelor\u201d has a meaning; it means man who has\nnever been married. Is the same true of names?\n\u201cSocrates\u201d certainly applies to things. It applies, most\nobviously, to the founder of Western philosophy. When understood as a\ngeneric name (see\n Section 1),\n \u201cSocrates\u201d applies to several individuals: to a first\napproximation, all those who are called \u201cSocrates.\u201d But\ndoes \u201cSocrates\u201d also possess a meaning?\n\nSome names have meanings in a sense. I have heard \u201cMerlot\u201d\nused on the playground to summon a child, and knew of a married couple\nwhose respective names were \u201cSunshine\u201d and\n\u201cMoonlight.\u201d These names, we would say, have meanings.\n\u201cMoonlight,\u201d for instance, means light from the\nMoon. Something similar goes on when we say that\n\u201cTheodore\u201d means gift of god, or interpret a\nMohawk name with a verb phrase. But this sense of meaning turns out\nnot to be the one we are after.\n\nConsider that for \u201cbachelor\u201d the meaning\u2014man who\nhas never been married\u2014is also what determines the\nnoun\u2019s range of application. When the noun\n\u201cbachelor\u201d applies to someone, it\u2019s because they are\na man who has never been married. And when it fails to apply to\nsomeone, it\u2019s because they are not. By contrast, the kind of\nmeaning just canvassed for the names \u201cMerlot\u201d or\n\u201cMoonlight\u201d places no direct constraint on who they apply\nto. One may be named \u201cMerlot\u201d, and so fall within the\nname\u2019s range of application, no matter what relationship one\nbears to the wine grape variety, Merlot (Mill 1843: 34).\nMoreover, a relationship to the grape does not constitute the reason\nfor the name applying.\n\nIn this long tail of the article on semantics, we will confine\nourselves to the question of whether names have a meaning in the sense\nthat \u201cbachelor\u201d does. Do they have a meaning that\ndetermines, or restricts, their extension\n(i.e., their range of application or reference)? As we will see, even\npursuing this reduced target, philosophers have had to consider a\nseries of foundational questions about language and meaning. It is not\noff-limits to ask a different question about names, or to think about\ntheir meaning in some other way, but this question will open a path\nthrough the important topics in the semantics of names, and indeed the\nphilosophy of language.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the generic name \u201cAlice\u201d. Consider\nthe range of individuals to which it applies. Unlike the range of\n\u201cbachelor\u201d, this set is not united under a brief\ndefinition, but consists of all the various people (including Alice\nCooper), and perhaps things, referred to by (occurrences of) the name\n\u201cAlice\u201d. A natural view, then, is that the individual\nreferential relationships are what\u2019s basic here, and any\ngeneralization concerning a generic name\u2019s range of application\nis based on them, rather than the other way around. According to this\nview, there is no general meaning of the name, responsible for\ndetermining to whom or to what it correctly applies. While it is\npossible to articulate a (complex) condition that correctly sorts\nAlices from non-Alices on some basis other than those referential\nrelationships (for instance, a disjunction consisting of each\nAlice\u2019s unique time and place of birth), it is clear that any\nsuch condition is based on those pre-existing relationships, rather\nthan being, with any plausibility, their originating source.\n\nThe only concise way of delimiting the range of generic\n\u201cAlice\u201d is with a metalinguistic feature, such as\nbeing named \u201cAlice\u201d. And indeed some have\ndefended a metalinguistic account of the\nmeaning of generic names (see\n Section 2.10\n below). The challenge for the account is to distinguish the relevant\nfeature from that of being in the extension of\n\u201cAlice\u201d, which clearly cannot determine the extension\nin the robust sense required of a meaning (Kripke 1980: 68; Geurts\n1997: 326ff; Bach 2002: 83; Gray 2014).\n\nNext consider the specific name \u201cSocrates.\u201d It refers to a\ncertain citizen of Athens, and, in contrast to the generic case, this\n(unitary) extension may be delimited concisely without appeal to its\nonomastic features. Moreover, just like \u201cbachelor,\u201d\n\u201cSocrates\u201d appears in (some) dictionaries along with an\nexplanation supplying just this kind of non-linguistic identifying\ninformation. The following is from Lexico (see the link in Other\nInternet Resources):\n\n\n(469\u2013399 BC), Greek philosopher. As represented in the writings\nof his disciple Plato, he engaged in dialogue with others in an\nattempt to define ethical concepts by exposing and dispelling error\n(the Socratic method). Charged with introducing strange gods and\ncorrupting the young, Socrates was sentenced to death and died by\ndrinking hemlock.\n\n\nOf course, the majority of specific names do not appear in any\ndictionary. Moreover, it should not be thought that dictionary\n\u201cdefinitions\u201d always give the meaning of the word they\nappear under (one entry for \u201cSocrates\u201d on Wiktionary just\nsays \u201cA male given name of mostly historical use\u201d). But\nsuppose we have a condition satisfied by, and only by, the referent of\n\u201cSocrates\u201d; one which is, moreover, listed below the name\nin certain dictionaries. For the sake of argument, suppose it is\nthe teacher of Plato and Xenophon. Would it follow that\n\u201cSocrates\u201d meant the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon?\n\nNot necessarily. First note that, prima facie,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d simply does not mean the teacher of Plato\nand Xenophon. While we would agree that Socrates was the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon, we would not be inclined to say that\nthis is what the word \u201cSocrates\u201d means. By\ncontrast, we are happy to say that \u201cbachelor\u201d means\nman who has never been married.\n\nSimilarly, though a dictionary might offer a definition of\n\u201ccat\u201d as domestic animal with retractile claws,\nwe would not be inclined to say that \u201ccat\u201d meant\ndomestic animal with retractile claws, though we would admit\nthat cats were such animals. Even if cats are the only\ndomestic animals in existence with retractile claws, it does not seem\ncorrect to say that this is the meaning of \u201ccat\u201d. The\nmeaning of a word is something more than just an accurate description\nof the contents of its extension.\n\nIn the first place, a condition that selects the correct range for a\nword is not necessarily the condition that determines that the word\nhas that range. Suppose all and only ascetics have matted hair. Still,\n\u201cascetic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean person with matted\nhair, because having matted hair, though it may be a\ndistinguishing mark of ascetics, is not what makes someone an ascetic.\nBut even supposing our condition is the one in virtue of which\n\u201cSocrates\u201d applies to the relevant Athenian, it still\ndoesn\u2019t follow that it is the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\nIt may yet be that \u201cSocrates\u201d doesn\u2019t have a meaning\n(compare Kripke 1980: 32\u201333). Though we take the meaning of a\nword to determine its range of application, we do not assume the\nconverse, that whatever determines the range of application of a word\nmust be its meaning. We allow that names might work differently from\n\u201cbachelor\u201d. Their extension might be determined by\nsomething other than a meaning; for instance, their previous use\n (Section 2.7).\n\nTo put it another way, the question as to whether a name has a meaning\nis not trivial. The name \u201cSocrates\u201d refers to a particular\nAthenian, and, unless reference is metaphysically basic, there must be\nsome feature of the world in virtue of which it does (cf. Kripke 1980:\n88, fn.38). However, this feature may or may not comprise the meaning\nof the specific name \u201cSocrates\u201d. It is really a further\nquestion whether this feature is semantic or meta-semantic, whether it\nis part of the meaning, or whether it establishes the name\u2019s\nreference without belonging to its meaning. The theory of (nominal)\nreference (see the entry on Reference) should be distinguished from\nthe\u2014intertwined\u2014theory of the semantics of names (Dickie\n2011).\n2.2 Cognitive Significance and Identification\n\nAnother issue we must disentangle from the semantics of names is that\nof their cognitive significance and allied\nbehavior in opaque contexts, including especially attitude reports\n(see the entry on Propositional Attitude Reports).\n\nNames that corefer do not always communicate the same information. For\ninstance, to one who is ignorant of the fact that the names\n\u201cHesperus\u201d (i.e., the Evening Star) and\n\u201cPhosphorus\u201d (i.e., the Morning Star) both refer to the\nplanet Venus, the sentence \u201cHesperus is a planet\u201d and the\nsentence \u201cPhosphorus is a planet\u201d transmit different\ninformation, producing different cognitive states and resultant action\n(Frege 1892). One who mishears an utterance of one of these sentences,\nmistaking it for the other, has misunderstood the speaker, despite\narriving at an interpretation that is extensionally correct (Loar\n1976).\n\nMoreover, coreferring names may be used with distinguishing import\neven by those in the know. When (in Wharton\u2019s novel) Miranda\nfalls upon the Abbot\u2019s mercy, and admits she has been playing\nthe part of a man to sidestep an ecclesiastical restriction on female\nperformers, he mercifully lifts the ban:\n\n\nMy only condition,\u201d he added with a truly paternal smile,\n\u201cis that, after the Signorina Miranda\u2019s performance at the\ntheatre her twin brother the Signor Mirandolo shall return every\nevening to the monastery. (Wharton, The Valley of\nDecision)\n\n\nThe Abbot\u2019s condition is not met unless Miranda returns to the\nmonastery each night in male guise (compare Saul 2007).\n\nRelatedly, coreferring names cannot always be substituted salva\nveritate in the context of a propositional attitude report (Frege\n1892). If Daphnis doesn\u2019t know that Hesperus is Phosphorus, then\nit could be true that\n\n(1) Daphnis believes\nthat Hesperus appears in the evening.\n\n\nWhile being false that\n\n(2) Daphnis believes\nthat Phosphorus appears in the evening.\n\n\nThese observations are connected with the main question of this\nsection\u2014do names have meanings? For names with the same\nreference could yet differ in meaning, and this might explain their\ndiffering cognitive significance. In particular, if a name\u2019s\nmeaning is (part of) what it contributes to the truth condition of an\nutterance, then a difference in meaning, in spite of an equivalence in\nreference, could lead to a different truth-value for the sentence.\n\nNevertheless, we will not consider this source of evidence for nominal\nmeaning further in the article. In the first place, the phenomena just\nrecounted are general to all kinds of referring expression (and\nperhaps other sorts of expression too), rather than being particular\nto names, and so their discussion properly belongs under a more\ngeneral head. Second, in cases where we are less uncertain that\nmeaning exists, it does not seem to correspond to cognitive\nsignificance. For example, given the right scenario,\n\u201cbachelor\u201d and the phrase documenting its\nmeaning\u2014\u201cman who has not been married\u201d\u2014would\nalso fail to substitute salva veritate in an attitude report.\nFinally, the debate over cognitive significance devolves into a\nstalemate, as any detailed explanation of the phenomena that relies on\nnames having meanings can be approximated by one that relies instead\non information which, while associated with a name, is not considered\nits meaning (Soames 2002).\n\nI will substantiate the last point at length, by considering a\nparticular account of the cognitive significance of names. The account\nrelates cognitive significance to the identifying\ninformation associated with a specific name in an agent\u2019s\nmind (Strawson 1974: 43ff). To illustrate this, suppose I know of two\nindividuals bearing the name \u201cZera Yacob\u201d. Most likely, I\nassociate a different sobriquet, or description, with each specific\nversion of the name, as a way of maintaining the distinction in my\nmind. Moreover, whenever I speak or hear the name \u201cZera\nYacob\u201d, I implicitly associate the utterance with one of those\ndescriptions; either it is the seventeenth century philosopher or the\nfifteenth century Emperor of Ethiopia who is being named in this\ninstance. Plausibly, I cannot felicitously utter \u201cZera\nYacob\u201d without selecting either the prince or the philosopher as\nmy intended referent, and I can\u2019t fully interpret\nanother\u2019s utterance of the name without forming a parallel\ndetermination.\n\nIf each specific name is annexed to some identifying\ninformation\u2014enough to single out its bearer at least in the mind\nof the agent\u2014then this could explain the different cognitive\nsignificances of coreferring names. But does the identifying sobriquet\nalso represent the meaning of the name? There are several reasons to\ndoubt that it does. First, different agents might well associate\ndifferent identifying information with the same referring use of a\nname (Frege 1892), which would seem to conflict with the natural\nassumption that a name like \u201cSocrates\u201d has a single\nmeaning throughout a community. Different responses are available\nhere. We might say that the meaning of a name is relative to the\nidiolect of the individual, rather than the dialect of the group.\nAnother option would be to claim that the meaning of a name in a\npublic language is aggregated in some way from the identifying\ninformation associated with it by each member of the relevant public\n(Strawson 1959: 191\u2013192). Note that, on the latter sort of\naccount, it would be possible for a user (or even every user) of the\nname to only have a partial grip on its (aggregate) meaning (see\n Section 2.3).\n\nSecond, information that is sufficient for identificational purposes\n(internally distinguishing one bearer of a name from another) may yet\nbe inadequate to determine the extension of a name (Strawson 1959:\n20\u201321). For instance, \u201cthe Roman author\u201d is enough\nto distinguish Marcus Tullius Cicero from Cicero, Illinois; but it is\nnot sufficient to select a unique Cicero in the world (Kripke 1980:\n81; Donnellan 1970: 343). There is, for instance, Cicero\u2019s\nyounger brother, Quintus Tullius Cicero, also an author of several\nworks.\n\nA description can also have the identifying function though it is\nfalse of the proper referent of the specific name. For instance, many\nwould have inaccurately identified Christopher Columbus as the first\nEuropean to visit the Americas (Searle 1958: 168; Strawson 1964: 102;\nDonnellan 1970: 341; Kripke 1980: 83\u201384).\n\nIf the feature used for identificational purposes is false of the\nreferent of the name, then by our earlier criterion it cannot serve as\nthe meaning of the name. If it is true, but insufficient to\ndiscriminate the referent, then the situation is different. It is\npossible to claim that the identifying feature is the meaning of the\nname, while admitting that nominal meaning merely constrains, without\nfully determining, nominal reference. Names would then be akin to\ncertain pronouns (arguably, the meaning of \u201cshe\u201d merely\nlimits its possible referents in certain respects).\n\nThus, it is possible to find a place in one\u2019s theory for\nidentifying descriptions, and even use them to explain cognitive\nsignificance, while still denying that they correspond to the meanings\nof names. Strawson himself, who developed the account of\nidentification on display, and who thought that a name\u2019s\nreference was determined by its associated identifying description\n(1959: 181\u2013182), did not conceive of that description as\nexpressing the name\u2019s meaning (1950: 340).\n\nMore generally, suppose we call whatever theoretical posit captures\nthe cognitive significance of names, sense,\nfollowing Frege. The crucial point is that we need not conflate the\nlinguistic meaning of a name with its sense (Kripke 1980: 59; Burge\n1977). This is so even if we take a name to contribute its sense to\nthe truth condition of an attitude report, as Frege also suggested.\nRemember, we understand meaning as something that (if present)\ndetermines or constrains the extension of a word. We have refrained\nfrom identifying meaning with a word\u2019s contribution to the truth\ncondition of a declarative sentence (what is usually called its semantic\nvalue). If we had, then it would follow,\nfrom the fact that names do contribute to truth conditions, that names\nhave meanings; and we had wanted to frame the issue of a name\u2019s\nmeaning so that it didn\u2019t have a trivial answer. Instead, we\nhave left open whether a name\u2019s contribution\u2014sense or\nreferent\u2014is determined by its meaning, or else, in the absence\nof such a meaning, by extra-semantic factors, such as use.\n2.3 Meaning and the a priori\n\nThere are propositions we can only confirm or justify by observation\nand experiment. There are, for example, various ways to establish that\nthe Earth is round, an especially conclusive one being\ncircumnavigation. There are other propositions that no observation can\nconfirm, nor, indeed, disconfirm; for instance, the proposition that\nbachelors are unmarried. Since \u201cbachelor\u201d is defined as\nman who has never been married, we derive this proposition\nprior to any consultation of the external world. It is a\npriori.\n\nBy similar reasoning, if \u201cSocrates\u201d meant the teacher\nof Plato and Xenophon, it would be a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato (Kripke 1980: 65). However, unlike the\nproposition that bachelors are unmarried, this claim does not seem to\nbe a priori. Intuitively speaking, the widely held belief\nthat Socrates taught Plato could turn out to be false. Perhaps one day\ndocuments will come to light establishing that the person who served\nas a model for the character of Socrates in Plato\u2019s dialogues\n(and other similar traditions) lived out his life prior to\nPlato\u2019s birth. Such evidence would appear to refute the\ntradition according to which Plato was Socrates\u2019 pupil.\n\nBy contrast, no observation could unseat the belief that bachelors are\nunmarried. Even irrefutable evidence that each individual we thought a\nbachelor had in fact been married would not convince us that bachelors\nwere, after all, married men. We would conclude instead that those men\nweren\u2019t bachelors (compare Putnam 1962 and Unger 1983 on\n\u201ccat\u201d).\n\nNow an a priori proposition is not automatically known. If\none is ignorant of the meaning of the relevant terms, then one\npresumably won\u2019t know the a priori proposition that\nfollows from the meaning. Someone might be unaware, for example, that\nall linguistic discourse is either verse or prose, or that all planets\nhave sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium; yet both\npropositions follow from the definitions of the relevant words\n(\u201cprose\u201d is defined as language without the metrical\nstructure of verse; and the official definition of\n\u201cplanet\u201d includes a clause requiring hydrostatic\nequilibrium).\n\nThe fact that some users of \u201cSocrates\u201d don\u2019t realize\nthat Socrates taught Plato does not immediately show that the\nproposition is a posteriori. It could be that they are\nignorant of the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d, and if they had\nknown it, they would also have known (a priori) that Socrates\ntaught Plato. The same goes for the intuition that it could turn\nout that Socrates did not teach Plato. This intuition could\nsimilarly originate in obscuring ignorance of meaning. It should be\nkept in mind that the argument we are considering in this section\n(often termed the epistemic argument) takes\nfor granted that if \u201cSocrates\u201d had a meaning, we would\nknow what it was, and be in a position to draw a priori\nconclusions from it.\n\nWith this one caveat, the epistemic argument is an effective challenge\nto many accounts that provide names with a substantial meaning. Often\nwhat would follow from the proposed meaning is something that,\naccording to our intuition, could turn out to be false. An ingenious\nresponse to the argument is to identify the meaning of a name with\n(roughly speaking) whatever claims about its extension could not turn\nout to be false, according to ordinary speakers\u2019 intuitions\n(Chalmers & Jackson 2001). Such an account of meaning (call it\napriorist) is of course immune to the\nepistemic argument.\n\nWhat sorts of claims are we talking about here? Not the claim that\nSocrates taught Plato: this, intuitively, could turn out to be false.\nBut what about the claim that it could turn out false that\nSocrates taught Plato. The justification for this claim was not\nobservational evidence, but an intuition about a hypothetical\nscenario, and what we would say about Socrates in that scenario. We\nfelt that if the true source of Plato\u2019s character had died\nbefore Plato was born, then it would follow that Socrates did not\nteach Plato. But whence this judgment? Perhaps it stems from the\nconviction that, roughly, \u201cSocrates\u201d will refer to whoever\nturns out to be the actual source of the eponymous character in\nPlato\u2019s dialogues (and other similar traditions). This is not\nquite a priori either. As a claim, it stands or falls on our\nempirical knowledge of the relevant traditions. Still, one imagines\nthe claim could be winnowed down further, until, as it were, the a\nposteriori hull is gone. The remaining polished kernel would then\nserve as the apriorist meaning of \u201cSocrates.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see this exercise carried out in full, but\nwhat would it show? Not that a certain core of knowledge must\nconstitute the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d. There is always the\npossibility that \u201cSocrates\u201d has no meaning. Even if the\naccount of what determines the reference of a name has an a\npriori core, we may yet conclude that such reference is\ndetermined extra-semantically. Perhaps the a priori core is\nsimply an (a priori) theory of reference in general, applied\nto the special case of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, the apriorist account, like the epistemic argument that\nled us to it, relies on the assumption that meanings, and their a\npriori consequences, are known to speakers, who then lean on this\nknowledge in forming intuitive judgments about what could turn out to\nbe true of Socrates\u2014or bachelors. But consider the person who\nfinds it intuitive that a planet might not have achieved hydrostatic\nequilibrium? We would like to say that they don\u2019t fully\nunderstand what \u201cplanet\u201d means, given that this is one of\nthe conditions in the 2006 definition arrived at by the International\nAstronomical Union (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n However, on the apriorist account, we are forced to say instead that\nthe proposition that all planets have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium\ndoes not follow from the meaning of \u201cplanet\u201d, as it does\nnot belong to the a priori core (as proven by the one speaker\nwho doesn\u2019t find it intuitive). Indeed, the a priori\ncore, whatever it is, only supports the judgment that all planets have\nachieved hydrostatic equilibrium in conjunction with the a\nposteriori knowledge that achieving hydrostatic equilibrium was a\nclause in the definition of \u201cplanet\u201d stipulated by an\nauthority.\n\nThe concern is that many uncontroversial examples of word meaning are\nnot known to some speakers (and for any example, including\n\u201cbachelor,\u201d we could easily contrive a case in which it\nwas not known to someone), and hence must be excluded by the\napriorist. Even if one is convinced that whatever (directly)\ndetermines the extension of a word constitutes its meaning, there is\nstill no guarantee that a particular (or general) theory of extension\ndetermination can be found, however implicit, in native speaker\nintuitions. Or, supposing it can be, that the process of deriving it\nfrom those intuitions is one of a priori demonstrative\ninference. Like other aspects of linguistic theory, the road from\nnative speaker judgments to theory is presumably the ampliative method\nof science.\n2.4 Meaning and Necessity\n\nThe fact that \u201cbachelor\u201d means man who has never been\nmarried implies that bachelors are necessarily\nunmarried. A married bachelor is an impossibility, a contradiction in\nterms. A man who in fact lived his life as a bachelor could have\n(instead) married, but if he had, his bachelor status would\nimmediately have ceased. The scenario is thus not one involving a\nmarried bachelor, but merely one where a particular person, actually a\nbachelor, gets married instead.\n\nThis is a separate topic from that of the previous section, since\nnecessity and the a priori can come apart. Consider the claim\nthat the nucleus of an atom of gold contains 79 protons. This claim is\nnot a priori. It is the fruit of an empirical inquiry into\nthe nature of gold, and could certainly not have been deduced from the\nmeaning of \u201cgold\u201d. It is, however, a necessary truth\n(Kripke 1980: 123\u2013125). The nature of gold is, in this respect,\nimmutable. If you added or subtracted protons from the nucleus, you\nwould no longer have an atom of gold, but some other element\ninstead.\n\nConsider once more the view that \u201cSocrates\u201d means the\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon. Does it similarly predict a\nnecessary connection between being Socrates and being the teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon? Is it committed to the impossibility of a Socrates\nwho never taught? If so, the view would seem to be in trouble. For it\nappears a contingent fact\u2014one that could have been\notherwise\u2014that Socrates taught Plato (Searle 1958: 172; Kripke\n1980: 74). Socrates could, after all, have died in infancy; or else\nlived, but declined to take on his most famous pupil.\n\nNote that \u201cSocrates\u201d is a referring expression, while\n\u201cbachelor\u201d is a nominal predicate. In carrying over the\nanalogy from \u201cbachelor\u201d, we had to convert\n\u201cSocrates\u201d into a predicate (\u201cbeing\nSocrates\u201d). This was because the necessity we observed for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d involved the co-instantiation of\nproperties\u2014one can\u2019t be a bachelor without\nbeing unmarried (compare Dummett 1973: 131). But it may be\nthat referring expressions relate to their meanings in a different way\nto predicates\u2014one that implies no necessary co-instantiation of\nproperties. Indeed, we will find that this is the case, for at least\none sort of referring expression, in\n Section 2.5.\n\nA different test using modal sentences relies on the assumption that\nsynonymous expressions should be substitutable salva veritate\nin modal contexts. To agree to this, we don\u2019t have to think that\nthe meaning of an expression corresponds to its truth-conditional\ncontribution; only that, in identical linguistic contexts, synonymous\nexpressions will make (or are likely to make) the same contribution.\n(Keep in mind that synonymous expressions are certainly not\nsubstitutable salva veritate in all contexts. Substituting\n\u201cman who has never been married\u201d for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d might change the truth-value of an attitude\nreport if the attitude holder is ignorant of the meaning of\n\u201cbachelor.\u201d)\n\nAs it turns out, \u201cSocrates\u201d and \u201cthe teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon\u201d cannot be substituted salva\nveritate in modal contexts (compare Kripke 1980:\n40\u201342):\n\n(3) The teacher of\nPlato and Xenophon might not have been human.\n(4) Socrates might not\nhave been human.\n\n\nIf we consider that Plato and Xenophon could have been raised by\nwolves, (3) sounds true, while (4) remains false. Thus, if we agree\nthat synonyms should substitute in this context,\n\u201cSocrates\u201d cannot mean the teacher of Plato and\nXenophon.\n\nHowever, observe that (3) also has a (false) reading on which it says\nroughly the same thing as (4), referring to a particular man, rather\nthan generalizing over teachers of Plato and Xenophon. (A competing\nexplanation is that \u201cSocrates\u201d is lexically univocal, but\ngives rise to a structural ambiguity, being analyzed as a scope-taking\nexpression\u2014see Russell 1905; Neale 1990. Note, however, that\nthis approach doesn\u2019t lend itself as well to the defense of our\ndescriptivist hypothesis. Such a defense needs to claim that names,\nperhaps similarly to the quantifier \u201ceach\u201d, gravitate\ntowards the widest possible scope in the sentence\u2014see Dummett\n1981: Ch.9; Soames 1998; and Sosa 2001 for further discussion of this\nproposal.)\n\nFollowing Rothschild (2007) and Nichols (in unpublished work; see\n other internet resources),\n we could say that while the name \u201cSocrates\u201d refers to an\nindividual, the definite description \u201cthe teacher of Plato and\nXenophon\u201d can refer either to that same individual, or else to a\nparticular role\u2014namely, that of teacher to Plato and Xenophon.\nWhen understood in the second way, (3) means something like \u201cThe\nrole of teacher to Plato and Xenophon might have been filled by a\nnon-human\u201d. This parallels the fact that \u201ctiger\u201d has\na taxonomic reading on which it applies to kinds alongside the more\nstandard reading on which it applies to individual animals, so that\n\u201cthe tiger\u201d can refer to either the kind or some\nparticular tiger.\n\nSupposing that definite descriptions can refer to roles would explain\ntheir different behavior in modal sentences without threatening the\nidea that a name could be synonymous with a definite description on\nits non-role reading. Still, the foregoing reflections offer no\nfurther help in interpreting the claim that \u201cSocrates\u201d\nmeans the teacher of Plato and Xenophon. The claim\ncan\u2019t simply be that \u201cSocrates\u201d and \u201cthe\nteacher of Plato and Xenophon\u201d corefer. Even one who denies a\nmeaning to \u201cSocrates\u201d admits this. But if there are no\ndetectable modal consequences of a name\u2019s having some meaning,\nin what other substantial sense should this possession be\nunderstood?\n2.5 Rule of Use\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s entry for the first person\npronoun \u201cI\u201d says: \u201cUsed by the speaker or writer\nreferring to himself or herself.\u201d This is plausibly a linguistic\nrule: it is correct English to use \u201cI\u201d this way. The\ndefinition also determines the reference of (a particular utterance\nof) \u201cI\u201d. It seems reasonable, then, to think of this rule\nas giving the meaning of \u201cI\u201d (Kaplan 1989a: 520\u2013521;\nReichenbach 1947, 284).\n\nThis is handy: we now have an example of the form the meaning of a\nreferring expression can take. The first benefit is that we can\nconfirm that this kind of meaning doesn\u2019t generate necessities,\nthe way the meaning of \u201cbachelor\u201d did. Suppose\n\u201cI\u201d means the speaker in the context (Kaplan\n1989a: 495). Well, it is possible to be me without being the speaker\nin the context. Though I am speaking now, I might have remained silent\n(Kaplan 1989a: 509).\n\nIt is evident, too, that the meaning of \u201cI\u201d cannot perform\nthe duties of an interpersonal Fregean sense (discussed in\n Section 2.2).\n The rule determining the reference of an utterance of \u201cI\u201d\n(what Kaplan calls its character) is not the\nsame as the contribution such an utterance makes to the communicated\ncontent (the cognitive significance of the utterance) on a particular\noccasion of use. Indeed, whereas \u201cI\u201d has a fixed\ncharacter, it contributes different senses when uttered by different\npeople (see Frege 1918\u20131919 [1956: 296]).\n\nThe rule is not irrelevant to the cognitive significance of an\nutterance of the term, of course; and may be considered the mode by\nwhich its interpersonal content is presented (Kaplan 1989a: 530).\nMoreover, the meaning of \u201cI\u201d supports a priori\ninferences of a particular sort (Kaplan 1989a: 508\u2013509). For\ninstance, no empirical investigation is required to divine that an\nutterance of \u201cI\u201d refers to the one uttering it. Hence,\n\u201cI am the one uttering this sentence\u201d is a\npriori.\n\nThe meaning of \u201cI\u201d provides a model for the meaning of\nnames, but is there a candidate meaning for a name that fits this\nmodel? \u201cI\u201d does not refer to the same person every time it\nis used, so we might reasonably suppose that it provides a better\nmodel for a generic name\u2014also used for different\npeople\u2014than a specific one. The rough thinking being that if a\nname is only ever used to refer to one thing (as a specific name is),\nthere is no real need for a general rule of use.\n\nWhat would a rule of use for a generic name look like? If\n\u201cI\u201d constrains reference to the speaker in the context,\nthen generic \u201cAlice\u201d, in most situations (unless the\nreferent is a protected witness, for example), constrains reference to\npersons called \u201cAlice\u201d. A semantic rule of use for generic\n\u201cAlice\u201d would thus amount to a metalinguistic account of\nits meaning. More will be said motivating and criticizing such a\nstance in the dedicated\n section (2.10)\n to come, but I will preview a major criticism of the view that names\nhave a metalinguistic rule of use below.\n\nThe rule governing the use of a generic name like \u201cAlice\u201d\nhas been spelled out by various theorists in similar ways (Burks 1951;\nLerner & Zimmermann 1984, 1991; Haas-Spohn 1995; Recanati 1997;\nPelczar & Rainsbury 1998). On each occasion of use, a referent for\nthe name will be more-or-less available, or obligatory, depending on\nthe familiarity and salience of a convention that tags that referent\nwith that generic name. So a minimal rule of use for\n\u201cAlice\u201d would require each utterance to refer to one to\nwhom that (generic) name has been conventionally attached. A stronger\nversion would have it that an utterance of \u201cAlice\u201d\nobligatorily refers to the most salient individual of this sort.\n\nAs Kaplan (1989a: 562) points out, there is a competing account of the\nvariable reference of names that does not treat them as generic\nexpressions with a metalinguistic meaning (rule of use). On that\naccount, the variation in reference is due to either ambiguity or\nhomonymy (i.e., there are many different \u201cspecific\u201d names\nwith the same form), and what passes for a rule of use on the\nmetalinguistic theory is not properly ascribed to the meaning of names\nat all, but is rather a more generally applicable procedure of\ndisambiguation (see also Evans 1973, as well as Evans 1982, where\nname-using practices, rather than specific names, are settled on in\nthe process of disambiguation).\n\nTo illustrate the difference, recall that it is a convention of\nEnglish that a speaker uses \u201cI\u201d to refer to themselves.\nThat convention is available to us, roughly speaking, whenever we are\nconversing with fellow English speakers, and we must always\ndisambiguate an uttered token of \u201cI\u201d (distinguishing it,\nsay, from homophone \u201ceye\u201d) prior to applying this\nconvention to determine the token\u2019s referent. The availability\nof the \u201cI\u201d convention in a conversation, and the\ndisambiguation of an individual token of \u201cI\u201d, while\ncrucial to communication, are matters that come before applying its\nrule of use, and so are distinct from the matters addressed in that\nrule.\n\nWe might go so far as to say that the sort of things a metalinguistic\nrule of use ranges over\u2014conventions and the like\u2014are just\nnot suitable targets for linguistic meanings (compare Pelczar &\nRainsbury 1998: 297\u2013298). However, a rule of use just like the\none advanced for generic \u201cAlice\u201d is very plausible for\ncertain other expressions. For instance, \u201cthe tall Alice\u201d\nor even just \u201cthe Alice\u201d (see Jeshion 2017 for\nunexceptionable examples of the latter) is a context-sensitive phrase\nused to refer to the most salient individual satisfying a\nmetalinguistic predicate (either being tall and being called\n\u201cAlice\u201d, or just being called \u201cAlice\u201d). For\nsuch examples, disambiguation between a number of different senses (of\neither \u201cthe Alice\u201d or \u201cthe tall Alice\u201d) is not\na plausible account.\n\nIt is obvious in hindsight that natural language, in its versatility,\nwould not disbar metalinguistic rules of use. Still, the point remains\nthat ceteris paribus we should prefer pre-semantic\ndisambiguation as an explanation, since it is required anyway, to\nintroducing a metalinguistic rule of use that apes it.\n2.6 The Cluster Theory\n\nSuppose we are convinced, perhaps by arguments already given, that\nthe teacher of Plato and Xenophon is not, by itself, a\nsatisfactory specification of the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\nWe might beat an orderly retreat, maintaining that it is still part of\nthat meaning. Instead of being specifiable as a single succinct\ncondition, the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d is constructed from a\ncluster of similar conditions.\n\nStrawson, though he did not think names were meaningful, proposed that\nthe referent of a specific name was determined by the collection of\nidentifying descriptions associated with the name in the\ncommunity:\n\n\nSuppose we take a group of speakers who use, or think they use, the\nname, \u201cSocrates\u201d, with the same reference. Suppose we then\nask each member of the group to write down what he considers to be the\nsalient facts about Socrates, and then form from these lists of facts\na composite description incorporating the most frequently mentioned\nfacts. Now it would be too much to say that the success of\nterm-introduction within the group by means of the name requires that\nthere should exist just one person of whom all the propositions in the\ncomposite description are true. But it would not be too much to say\nthat it requires that there should exist one and only one person of\nwhom some reasonable proportion of these propositions is true. If, for\nexample, it should be found that there was just one person of whom\nhalf the propositions were jointly true, and just one person, a\ndifferent one, of whom the other half of the propositions were jointly\ntrue, then, unless some indication were given of which Socrates was\nmeant, it would become impossible to give a straightforward answer to\nthe question, whether any particular \u201cproposition about\nSocrates\u201d was true or false. It is true, perhaps, of\nSocrates\\(_1\\), and not of Socrates\\(_2\\). It is neither true nor\nfalse of Socrates simpliciter, for, it turns out, there is no\nsuch person. (Strawson 1959: 191\u2013192)\n\n\nSearle (1958) responds to the epistemic argument (see\n Section 2.3)\n by proposing a cluster theory. That argument seemed to show that\nindividual components of the cluster, such as taught Plato,\ncould not be necessary conditions on belonging to the name\u2019s\nextension. For otherwise it would be knowable a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato. (Note that there is a similar problem with\ntreating it as a sufficient condition; for then it would be a\npriori that no-one other than Socrates taught Plato.) Instead,\nSearle suggests that a name\u2019s meaning imposes the weaker\nrequirement that some member of the cluster be true of the\nreferent. On his account, it is only a priori that the\nreferent possesses the disjunction of the conditions of the\ncluster. (Note that this weak condition is unlikely to single out a\nreferent for the name; hence Searle does not seem to provide a\ncomplete picture of reference determination. But strengthening the\naccount would only make the a priori consequences\nstronger.)\n\nSearle\u2019s escape route is blocked if one can show that, for any\nfinite list of the relevant sort (and for persons fully knowledgeable\nof the name\u2019s meaning\u2014see\n Section 2.3),\n it is conceivable that the true referent satisfies none of the\nconditions on the list. If clusters are finite lists of conditions,\nthen the theory predicts that there is some such list for which it is\na priori that the referent satisfies at least one of its\nconditions.\n\nOne way of so arguing would be to cultivate the intuition that any\nfinite list must be incomplete. Given any list, there is a conceivable\nscenario in which some further property\u2014one that was left off\nthe list\u2014proves crucial in determining the name\u2019s\nreference. This kind of argument was used by Friedrich Waismann (1945)\nto demonstrate the \u201copen texture\u201d of empirical predicates,\nsuch as \u201cgold\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d. But it seems that\nthe list of factors that could conceivably be relevant to determining\nthe referent of \u201cSocrates\u201d is similarly open ended. If\nthis hunch is correct, then the best we could hope for from a finite\ncluster theory is a kind of ceteris paribus determination:\n\n\n\nIf such-and-such facts obtain and no other facts relevant to the\ndetermination of the reference of \u201cSocrates\u201d, then\n\u201cSocrates\u201d refers to so-and-so.\n\n\nKripke (1980: 66\u201367) argues that, so long as our cluster\nconsists only of properties commonly attributed to the bearer of the\nname, as on Strawson\u2019s account, it is conceivable that none of\nits members applies to the referent. His case is buoyed by examples\nwhere experts posit or even identify a historical figure behind a\npopular legend, and treat the historical personage, who might share\nnone of the attributes of the legendary one, as the true referent of\nthe name. We might respond by applying Strawson\u2019s method to the\ncommunity of experts, rather than the general populace where the\nlegend holds sway, as it would then succeed in picking out the\nhistorical figure. However, the general observation is that no group\nis incorrigible. Even those experts could turn out, it seems, to be\nwholly wrong in their descriptions of the name\u2019s referent (as\nrevealed, perhaps, by a new wave of experts).\n\nKripke thus provides a direct challenge to a cluster theory based on\nidentifying descriptions. A complication is that Strawson explicitly\ncountenances identifying descriptions that are parasitic on other\nspeakers\u2019 use (such as the individual Plato referred to as\n\u201cSocrates\u201d). Kripke attempts to repulse this\nmaneuver, noting that the reference of one\u2019s own utterance of a\nname is ultimately determined by the reference of the person from whom\none in fact learned the name, rather than the person one might\nmistakenly identify as such (1980: 90\u201391; see also Geach 1969:\n288\u2013289; and Donnellan 1970).\n\nSuppose we could craft a version of the cluster theory that was\nmaterially correct (it satisfies all of our intuitions about the\nreference of the name in different eventualities). We might\nlegitimately ask, as we have done before, whether this theory succeeds\nin giving the meaning of the name. It seems that many have favored\nthis conclusion chiefly for want of an alternative: if a cluster of\ncommonly attributed features is not the meaning of a name, then what\nis? Or if, alternatively, names don\u2019t have meanings, then what\ncould it be that determines their extension? We will supply one\ngeneral answer to the second of these questions in the next\nsection.\n2.7 Reference Without Meaning: the Use Theory\n\nThe range of application of the noun \u201cbachelor\u201d is\ndetermined in two steps. First, something (we haven\u2019t seen what)\nestablishes that \u201cbachelor\u201d means man who has never\nbeen married. Second, \u201cbachelor\u201d applies to all and\nonly those things that satisfy the condition specified in its\nmeaning\u2014the men who have never been married. If names have\nmeanings, then their referents or ranges (in the case of generic\nnames) will be determined in the same way. However, many philosophers\nhave found the view that names do not have a meaning intuitively\ncompelling (Mill 1843: 34, 36\u201337; Strawson 1950; Ziff 1960:\n85\u201389, 93\u201394; Marcus 1961). They still believe names\nrefer, and so require an alternative metasemantics\u2014an account,\nin this case, of what determines reference\u2014to the\nmeaning-mediated one.\n\nThe now standard alternative to the meaning-mediated model is one on\nwhich reference (or range) is directly established by use.\nThe referent is the referent (or the range the range) because it\nsatisfies a particular condition, but that condition amounts to\nconsistency with past use, rather than encapsulating the meaning of\nthe expression. Proponents of the use model tend to emphasize the\nexternalism of this determining use. For\nexample, in the quote below, Evans elaborates the rough idea of the\nreferent being known as NN by citing the \u201cactual\npattern of dealings\u201d with the referent\u2014by which he means\nspecifically the occasions where the referent has been identified as\nNN by certain members of the community (the \u201cproducers\u201d of\nthe particular name-using practice)\u2014rather than basing it on the\nrecognitional capacities that enable the identification (which would\nhew closer to Strawson).\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to suggest that what makes it the case that an\nordinary proper-name-using practice involving the name\n\u201cNN\u201d concerns a particular individual is that that\nindividual should be known to the producers in the practice as\nNN. It is the actual pattern of dealings the producers have had\nwith an individual\u2014identified from time to time by the exercise\nof their recognitional capacities in regard to that\nindividual\u2014which ties the name to the individual. (Evans 1982:\n382, emphasis in the original)\n\n\nWe will now look, in a general way, at how the reference of a name\ncould be determined by other aspects of its use. Our approach will\nsingle out attribution (of a name to someone)\nas the relevant basis. Other approaches are possible, but the\n(technical) notion of attribution will be broad enough to cover the\nuse theories of Evans and Kripke.\n\nTo refer is to use an expression to identify some individual, usually\nin order to talk about them. Attribution of a name, by contrast,\nrequires the attributee to be identified (at least partially)\nindependently of the deployment of the name. To attribute a name to\nsomeone is just to treat someone\u2014thus extrinsically\nidentified\u2014as belonging to its extension; to assert or\npresuppose that the name applies to them. A straightforward example,\nwhere the attributee is identified by a gesture (or her proximity),\nwould be:\n\n(5) This is\nMiranda.\n\n\nOthers include vocative address (\u201cHello, Miranda!\u201d), where\nthe name is attributed to the addressee, and stipulation (\u201cLet\nthis one be Zappa\u201d). Constructions with appellative verbs like\n\u201ccall\u201d are tailor-made for name attribution (\u201cCall\nme Ishmael\u201d), but attribution may also be discerned in the\nbackground of a more casual kind of utterance. Even \u201cHomer was a\nmaster of narrative\u201d could be seen to presuppose an attribution\nof \u201cHomer\u201d to the author of certain narrative works (Evans\n1982: 394\u2013395).\n\nAttributions can be to individuals identified by description\nas well as by acquaintance. As we will see, Evans restricts\ncanonical applications by fiat to the by-acquaintance variety, while\nKripke seems to allow both sorts (1980: 94).\n\nThe main tenet of the use theory, as we will understand it, is that an\nutterance of a name is constrained in its reference by a set of prior\napplications. Assuming, for the moment, that the applications in that\nset were all to one individual (the same one was independently\nidentified in each case), then the utterance is simply constrained to\nrefer to that individual (in order, as we might put it, to be\nconsistent with those past applications). The use theory in outline is\nalmost the same as Strawson\u2019s view that the reference of a name\nis determined by the identifying descriptions associated with it in\nthe minds of its users, except that it replaces users\u2019\ndispositions to identify the referent of a name in a certain way with\ntheir public acts of committing to particular identifications.\n\nAnother difference exhibited by the use theories of Kripke and Evans\nis their flight from Strawson\u2019s democratic approach to\nidentification (Kripke 1980: 65). Both philosophers distinguish a\nproper subset of the applications of a name as canonical for\ndetermining its reference (see also Putnam 1975).\n\nIndeed, only one attribution is authoritative on the picture Kripke\noffers: an inaugurating stipulation that tyrannically governs all\nsubsequent use. The paradigm of this initiating act is the naming\nceremony, where a name is officially conferred on a person or thing.\nSince no subsequent attribution can alter the reference of downstream\nuse, Kripke\u2019s account makes no allowance for reference change\n(each \u201cchange\u201d in fact requires the institution of a new\nspecific name, with a new inaugural event).\n\nEvans loosens Kripke\u2019s restriction to allow for the influence of\nsubsequent attributions, and hence makes it possible to model change\nin the reference of a name. On his account, the authoritative\napplications are those of the (current) \u201cproducers\u201d of a\nname-using practice\u2014those in a position to make identifications\nbased on direct acquaintance, as they are capable of recognizing the\nindividual to which they attribute the name (Evans 1982:\n376\u2013377). Those who are not producers\u2014the\nconsumers\u2014have a more limited role in the practice. While they\ncan use the name to refer to the relevant individual, their own\nattributions need not be consistent with its reference.\n\nStandard use theories provide vague guidelines for selecting the set\nof historical attributions (the \u201cprecedent\u201d) that\nconstrains the reference of a particular utterance. For Kripke,\nselection involves tracing back the (intentionally mediated)\nhistorical chain from the utterance to an initial naming ceremony. For\nEvans it requires resolving the utterance to its proper name-using\npractice (a process he conceives of on the model of lexical\ndisambiguation), and then sifting out the attributions of the\nproducers in that practice.\n\nIt follows that Kripke is committed to the coreference of\n(appropriately) historically connected name-utterances, while Evans is\ncommitted to the coreference of all (simultaneous) utterances\nbelonging to the one practice. It is worth noting that a use theory\nneed not carry either of these commitments. We might instead,\nfollowing Donnellan (1974: 16), take the relevant applications to be\nthose that contribute to the historically correct explanation of the\nutterance in question. Since the same speaker, manifestly intending to\ncontribute to the same name-using practice, might utter the same name\nin pursuit of different goals, and hence with differing overall\nexplanations for each of their utterances, Donnellan\u2019s account\ndoes not carry the constraints of the other theories (for some pros\nand cons, see Donnellan 1970: 349\u2013351 and Evans 1973: 202).\n\nIf the precedent consists of more than one attribution, the theory\nadditionally needs some way to resolve conflicts\u2014cases where one\nattribution is to x, while another is to y. We could say\nthat any conflict in the precedent results in either reference failure\n(Evans 1982: 389) or referential indeterminacy (Lewis 1984). But we\ncan also imagine a more nuanced rule that prioritized certain\nproperties in the event of a conflict (the way Evans prioritizes the\napplications of producers over those of consumers).\n\nIn sum, the general framework for a use theory has it that a set of\nattributions P provides a constraint on the reference of an\nutterance u of a name (the theory may provide a means of\ndetermining P from u and its circumstances, or, at the\nextreme of relativism, will only say that reference is dependent on a\nchoice of precedent P). Each element \\(P_i\\) of P\ncontributes a general descriptive or situational feature that serves\nto identify the subject of the application (think of each \\(P_i\\) as a\nproperty, applied at the world of utterance). Additionally, the use\ntheory may specify a priority relation on P (or other means of\nresolving conflicts). The result is a condition (we can call it\n\\(C(u)\\) if we assume that an utterance u determines this\ncondition, by determining its proper precedent) that specifies the\nconstraint on the reference of the utterance required by consistency\nwith its proper precedent of attributions.\n2.8 Use Theories as Cluster Theories\n\nThe general use theory we have just described has an obvious affinity\nwith the cluster theory discussed just prior to it. The set of\ncanonical attributions in the use theory boils down to a cluster of\nconditions that jointly determine reference. Theories of both sorts\nare specified by providing a means of selecting the set, and a means\nof resolving conflicts among the properties in the set (in the event\nthat it does not turn out to be unitary).\n\nUse theories, like cluster theories, can be seen as open-ended in what\ncounts towards reference (I was careful to allow for this in the\ngeneral statement at the end of the previous section). Even an\nopen-ended cluster theory can issue in ceteris paribus claims\nsuch as: if these are the only considerations operating in the case,\nthen the reference is to so-and-so. In use theories, this\nopen-endedness crops up (at least) in the choice of precedent; so that\nthe best we might say, in some cases, is: if we fix the precedent like\nthis, then the reference is to such-and-such. Though we are certainly\nnot at a loss in deciding the proper precedent for any particular\ncase, it is difficult to say in general and with precision which\napplications should count. Evans\u2019 invocation of a name-using\npractice is too vague to guide us in concretely described cases, and\nKripke explicitly disclaims that he is providing a prediction-making\ntheory of nominal reference.\n\nIf we generalize cluster theories to allow them to include identifying\nproperties extracted from use (instead of restricting them to\ndispositional identifying descriptions), we can treat use theories as\na species of cluster theory. Indeed, a general umbrella is a good idea\nif it turns out that dispositional identifying descriptions play a\npart in determining reference alongside \u201cthe actual pattern of\ndealings\u201d (see Lewis 1984: 226\u201327, for this argument, and\nUnger 1983 for the cases on which it is based). For example, Evans\nobserves that one\u2019s utterance of \u201cAnir\u201d cannot refer\nto King Arthur\u2019s son if one believes it to be the name of\nArthur\u2019s burial place instead (1973: 198; see Dickie 2011 for a\nhost of similar examples).\n\nWe have already noted that a cluster theory need not give the meaning\nof a name; that adopting one is consistent with thinking that names\nare meaningless. Our example, recall, was Strawson, who denied the\nmeaningfulness of names (he would not even grant them a rule of use),\nyet thought their reference was determined by a cluster of identifying\ndescriptions. On the other hand, one might have reasons for thinking\nthe cluster\u2014even one that includes properties derived from\nuse\u2014accurately represents the meaning of a name (this appears,\nfor instance, to be Lewis\u2019s view). Finally, the cluster could\ncomprise influences from meaning alongside influences from use, with\nthe rule for adjudicating conflict, in part, deciding between factors\nof those different types.\n2.9 Empty Names and Negative Existentials\n\nA direct argument for the claim that a name\u2019s meaning is the\ncluster condition determining its reference comes from a consideration\nof claims of nonexistence (or \u201cnegative\nexistentials\u201d):\n\n\nConsider this example. If one says \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d,\nthis may mean various things. It may mean: the Israelites did not have\na single leader when they withdrew from Egypt\u2014or: their\nleader was not called Moses\u2014or: there cannot have been anyone\nwho accomplished all that the Bible relates of Moses\u2014or etc.,\netc. (Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79)\n\n\nThere is something compelling about Wittgenstein\u2019s observation.\nThe three alternatives he outlines (while being clear they are not\nexhaustive) describe different kinds of situation in which we might\nwell agree that Moses did not exist. While one could claim that the\nsentence is ambiguous, with an interpretation analyzed in each of\nthese ways at least, this is not what Wittgenstein has in mind. This\nis a good thing, since \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d cannot\nliterally mean that the Israelites did not have a single\nleader, as it is certainly conceivable that Moses existed but did not\nlead the Israelites (Kripke 1980: 66\u201367). Instead, we must treat\nhis alternatives in the manner already suggested for the components of\na cluster theory: as conditions that are neither strictly necessary\nnor inevitably sufficient, but which instead count as factors in favor\nof the nonexistence claim, interacting with an open-ended set of other\nfactors both for and against. Perhaps, indeed, Wittgenstein himself\nheld this view in an inchoate way:\n\n\nHas the name \u201cMoses\u201d got a fixed and unequivocal use for\nme in all possible cases?\u2014Is it not the case that I have, so to\nspeak, a whole series of props in readiness, and am ready to lean on\none if another should be taken from under me, and vice versa?\n(Wittgenstein 1953: sec. 79)\n\n\nIntuitions aside, negative existentials pose a serious challenge to\nthe view that names have no meaning. The difficulty is most acute on\nthe view that names only contribute their referent to the truth\ncondition of an utterance (but see Kripke 2013; Braun 1993; the papers\nin Everett & Hofweber 2000); there is a way out, sketched below,\nfor one willing to treat nonreferring names as still contributing a\nsense (which, as you will recall from\n Section 2.2,\n is consistent with the claim that names have no linguistic\nmeaning).\n\nGenerally speaking, the point of a singular negative existential\ncannot be to make a (false) claim about a certain individual, referred\nto by the singular term in the subject position, to the effect that\nthat individual does not exist. In this way, singular negative\nexistentials differ from run-of-the-mill utterances, such as:\n\n(6)Socrates drank\nhemlock.\n\n\nLet C(\u201cSocrates\u201d) stand for the (putative) cluster\ncondition that determines the referent of \u201cSocrates\u201d. We\nare able to state the condition under which (6) is true as:\n\n(7)\n\n   \\( \\exists x. C( \\textrm{\u2018Socrates\u2019})(x) \\wedge\n    \\textsf{drank.hemlock}(x) \\)\n\n\n\nWhile (7) is an accurate statement of the truth condition of (6), it\nmay not be the truth condition we get when we put together the\nsemantic contributions of the parts. (Once again, following Kripke,\nBurge and others, we must maintain a distinction between the semantic\ncontribution\u2014or semantic value\u2014of\nan uttered expression, and that expression\u2019s linguistic\nmeaning.) In particular, if we think that \u201cSocrates\u201d\ncontributes its referent (and only its referent) to the compositional\ntruth condition of a sentence, then we will prefer the following\nstatement (where s is an individual constant denoting\nSocrates):\n\n(8)\n\\(\\textsf{drank.hemlock}(s)\\)\n\n\nIf a name does not refer (take a name such as Urbain Le\nVerrier\u2019s \u201cVulcan\u201d or Algernon\u2019s\n\u201cBunbury\u201d\u2014from Wilde\u2019s play, The\nImportance of Being Earnest), then we obviously lack the option\nof expressing a truth condition that cites its referent. If a claim\ninvolving an empty name has a truth condition at all, it would have to\nbe a condition that, like (7), incorporates the condition that\ndetermines reference, rather than one that, like (8), incorporates the\nreferent itself.\n\nWe might not require a truth condition for statements like\n\u201cBunbury drank hemlock\u201d or \u201cThis is a fine red\none\u201d where nothing is demonstrated (cf. Strawson 1950: 333).\nThose sentences aren\u2019t true, and perhaps don\u2019t make\ntruth-evaluable claims at all. But Wittgenstein has drawn our\nattention to negative existentials, and we do have a grip on the sort\nof situations in which they would turn out to be true. If\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d) represents the cluster condition that\nsingles out Moses in all those situations in which we would say he did\nexist, then the truth condition for (9a) could be represented as (9b),\nbut not as (9c).\n\n(9)\n\n\na.\nMoses did not exist.\nb.\n\\(\\neg\\exists\nx.C(\\textrm{\u201cMoses\u201d})(x)\n\\wedge \\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x))\\)\nc.\n\\(\\neg\\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(m))\\)\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose, for a moment, we agree with Davidson (1967) that (i) when\nwe state the truth condition of a sentence in the right way, we give\nits semantic value. If the truth condition of (9a) cannot be stated as\n(9c), then that leaves (9b) as the remaining candidate for the\nsemantic value of the sentence. And (ii) if the semantic value of a\nsentence is determined by the semantic values of its parts, then\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d) must be the contribution of\n\u201cMoses\u201d (or possibly some larger constituent including\n\u201cMoses\u201d). Since we distinguish meaning and semantic value,\nit doesn\u2019t follow directly that C(\u201cMoses\u201d) is\nthe meaning of \u201cMoses\u201d. However, we cannot, according to\nthis argument, think of C(\u201cMoses\u201d) as a mere\nmetasemantic condition (perhaps derived from use), because\nmetasemantic conditions determine the semantic values of expressions,\nrather than vice versa.\n\nEither premise (i)\u2013(ii) in this argument could be challenged.\nSo, one could distinguish the (compositional) semantic value of a\nsentence from its truth condition. It would then be possible to say\nthat a name that does not refer makes no contribution to the semantic\nvalue of a sentence, and even that a sentence containing an empty name\ndoes not have a semantic value, while still maintaining that (9b)\ngives the correct truth condition for \u201cMoses does not\nexist\u201d. This is the approach of Donnellan (1974: 25), for whom\nthe compositional semantic value of an uttered sentence is the\nproposition that it expresses\u2014not quite its truth condition.\nWhile the utterance is true if that proposition holds and false if it\nfails to hold, Donnellan also thinks it may be true or false even if\nno proposition is generated. In particular, he proposes a rule that\nwould make a nonexistence statement true if generation fails in\nparticular way: specifically, if the historical explanation of its\nsingular subject\u2019s use does not serve to identify any\nappropriate individual.\n\nA different approach would replace\nC(\u201cMoses\u201d)\u2014which is just shorthand for a\ncluster condition\u2014with a truly metalinguistic condition, one\nthat includes the reference relation itself. Note that (10) entails\n(9b), given that C(\u201cMoses\u201d) is the condition that\ndetermines the referent of \u201cMoses\u201d.\n\n(10)\n  \\(\\neg\\exists\nx.\\textsf{refers}(\\textrm{\u201cMoses\u201d})(x) \\wedge\n  \\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x)) \\) \n\n\nMetalinguistic analyses of nonexistence statements face certain\nobjections. One is that \u201cMoses did not exist\u201d and its\ntranslation into French have different semantic values, since they say\nof different words that they don\u2019t refer to someone who once\nlived. This particular problem could be addressed if there was a\ncommon sense\u2014associated with at most one\nreferent\u2014expressed by English speakers uttering\n\u201cMoses\u201d and French speakers uttering its translation\n\u201cMo\u00efse\u201d (see Cumming 2013 for a proposal). The truth\ncondition could then replace parochial reference to language with\nreference to sense. If we let \\(\\delta\\) denote the sense expressed by\n\u201cMoses\u201d, then the truth condition would be:\n\n(11)\n\\( \\neg\\exists x.\\textsf{refers}(\\delta)(x) \\wedge\n\\textsf{past}(\\textsf{alive}(x)) \\) \n\n\nA further advantage of (11) is that we can give a compositional\nsemantics on which \u201cMoses\u201d contributes its sense,\n\\(\\delta\\), while the predicate contributes the existential\nquantification over the variable x as well as the relation\nconnecting the sense of an expression to its referent (glossed simply\nas refers in (11)). Musan (1997) and others\nhave given empirical arguments that a large class of predicates (those\nthat are not \u201cexistence independent\u201d in her terminology)\nhave such an existential component to their meaning. It is eminently\nreasonable to place \u201cexists\u201d in their company.\n\nA parallel compositional treatment of (10) would have\n\u201cMoses\u201d contributing itself (as though it occurred in a\nquotation). It perhaps seems more plausible, should we opt for (10),\nto carve the truth condition up differently, so that we assign\n\u201cMoses\u201d the metalinguistic meaning the individual\nreferred to by \u201cMoses\u201d. We will now turn to a\nconsideration of such a metalinguistic account of the meaning of\nnames.\n2.10 Metalinguistic Theories\n\nThe nominal phrase N in a definite description \u201cthe\nN\u201d contributes a condition that should be sufficient to\ndiscriminate the referent of the description from its local\ndistractors. If I felicitously utter \u201cthe red one\u201d, then\nyou should be able to successfully identify the referent I have in\nmind on the basis of its being red. In this case, the condition that\nserves for identification in context is not specific enough to\ndetermine the referent outright\u2014there are of course many red\nthings in existence other than the one I refer to.\n\nAs referring expressions, names can be seen to work in a similar way\n(compare Gray 2014: 216). In a felicitous utterance of\n\u201cAlice\u201d, some one individual is identified to the\naudience. In the case of names, the discriminating condition is\nmetalinguistic: the referent of the utterance is distinguished from\ndistractors by her feature of being called\n\u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis parallel suggests that a syntactic constituent of the\nname\u2014the proper nominal phrase\u2014contributes this\nmetalinguistic property; and the (generic) name \u201cAlice\u201d,\nas a whole, means the individual called\n\u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis compositional theory of a name\u2019s import is corroborated by\nseveral pieces of circumstantial evidence. First, many names,\nincluding certain names of places and things in English and of people\nin Greek and other languages, actually incorporate a definite\ndeterminer (\u201cthe\u201d in English). This suggests that names\nmight have a compositional semantics just like that of a definite\ndescription, where the determiner meaning combines with a property\ncontributed by the nominal complement to generate the meaning of the\noverall phrase.\n\nSecond, when a proper nominal occurs with other kinds of overt\ndeterminer, it often takes on a metalinguistic meaning (Sloat 1969;\nBurge 1973):\n\n(12) There are two\nAlices in my son\u2019s class.\n\n\nThe (proper) nominal \u201cAlice\u201d in (12) has a meaning one\nmight parse as being called \u201cAlice\u201d; or, even\nmore specifically, since (12) is a written sentence, as having a\nname spelled A-l-i-c-e (Gray 2015).\n\nOn the other hand, the metalinguistic property attributed to the\nproper nominal appears superfluous in accounting for the way a name\nidentifies its referent to the audience. The fact that the referent of\nthe speaker\u2019s use of \u201cAlice\u201d is called\n\u201cAlice\u201d is something that can reasonably be inferred from\nthe form of the referring expression alone, and doesn\u2019t require\naccess to its meaning. It is a familiar point that we should think\ntwice before attributing to meaning an inference that requires nothing\nmore than common sense (Grice 1975). Indeed, it is not clear that such\nan interpretation could belong to a conventional meaning, since a\nconvention requires a possible alternative, and there is no\nalternative to taking an utterance of \u201cAlice\u201d to narrow\nthe field to those individuals who are called \u201cAlice\u201d.\n\nThis brings us to a circularity objection brought against the\nmetalinguistic view (Strawson 1950: 340; Kripke 1980: 68\u201370).\nOne way of explicating having a name spelled A-l-i-c-e is to\nsay that there is a linguistic item\u2014a specific name with that\nspelling\u2014referring to one. Thus (12) says in effect that there\nare two individuals in the class referred to by such a name. This\nwould be consistent with an account on which specific names (unlike\nproper nominals occupying contexts like (12)) do not have a meaning,\ntheir reference being determined by use instead. More generally, this\nexplication treats the reference of specific names as the more basic\nnotion, defining the predicate meaning of the proper nominal in terms\nof such reference.\n\nTo think of names (not nominals) as having a metalinguistic meaning\nwhich then (partially) determines their reference, reverses this\npicture. Instead of the metalinguistic meaning being explicated in\nterms of the reference of specific names (satisfying a certain\nproperty), the reference of names would be explained with the help of\nthe metalinguistic meaning. To avoid a theory in which the explanation\ngoes in a circle, the metalinguistic predicate having a name\nspelled A-l-i-c-e must be explicated without appeal to the\nreference of names.\n\nFortunately, we already have the materials to attempt such an\nexplication. Back in\n Section 2.7,\n we distinguished the act of attributing a name to someone (previously\nidentified) from that of referring to someone with a name. It would be\nquite natural to interpret a metalinguistic predicate as applying to\nsomeone on the basis of a pattern of attribution, rather than a\npattern of reference. Indeed, the ordinary sense of \u201ccalling\nsomeone Alice\u201d is a reasonable gloss of the technical notion of\nattributing the name Alice to them (Evans in fact employs this\nterminology\u2014see his 1982: 383). So, for instance, I could not\nhave mistakenly called someone Alice without identifying them\nindependently, and people I refer to with a name but can\u2019t\nidentify independently\u2014for instance people whose names I am\nreading off a roll\u2014have not, intuitively speaking, been\ncalled that name by me.\n\nEven if name attribution is not the right way to ground metalinguistic\npredicates, any use theory, in attempting to explain the reference of\na name in terms of (distinct) features of its use, will have to employ\nsomething in its stead. Use theories and metalinguistic theories are\nin the same boat. While what ends up working for one won\u2019t\nnecessarily work for the other, it does not seem that the\nmetalinguistic theory is uniquely afflicted by a circularity\nobjection. Rather, both theories stand in need of a suitable reductive\nbase (for related discussion, see Burge 1973: 428; Geurts 1997:\n326\u2013327; Bach 2002: 83; Fara 2011; Gray 2014; Rami 2014: 858;\nGarc\u00eda-Carpintero 2017: 25).\n\nThe decision whether to grant a metalinguistic meaning to names\nappears to come down to what is basic and what is generated in the\nsemantic theory. If the meaning of a name is generated from the\nmetalinguistic meaning of the constituent proper nominal, then names\nwill accordingly have a metalinguistic meaning (most likely in the\nform of a rule of use). If instead names are treated as basic by the\nsemantics, then there is less motivation to assign them such a meaning\n(we shouldn\u2019t simply do so by default, as already discussed in\n Section 2.5).\n\nTo treat both names and metalinguistically interpreted nominal\npredicates as semantically basic is generally thought to be inferior\ntheoretical economy (Gray 2017: 436\u2013437). But this is surely too\nquick; a nominal predicate, though semantically basic, would still\ncount as a natural expression of the metalinguistic property\nit denotes (see Johnson 2018), and the naturalness of the choice could\nexplain the prevalence of the convention across languages and its ease\nof uptake. In any event, a parallel attempt is made on the\nanti-metalinguistic side to generate the metalinguistic\ninterpretations of proper nominals from existing resources\n(Bo\u00ebr 1975: 395; Leckie 2013; Jeshion 2015: 381; Gray 2017).\nHowever, unless those basic resources include the references of names\n(and Gray 2017 argues that this is hardly a promising route), the\nmetalinguistic theory can help itself to the same thrift.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the metalinguistic account that says the\nmetalinguistic predicates are themselves basic, just that they are\nmore basic than the meanings of names constructed out of them.\n\nDialectically speaking, then, the crucial issue appears to be the\ncompositional derivation of the name\u2019s meaning. I will go over a\nlittle of the linguistic data that has appeared so far in the debate.\nMuch of this data would appear, out of context, as the sheerest\nminutia. But the fate of what has recently been regarded as the best\nprospect for assigning a meaning to a proper name comes down to the\ninterpretation of these details.\n\nFirstly, a problem arises for the metalinguistic account when the name\nincludes an overt determiner (Cumming 2007: 22). \u201cThe\nBronx\u201d consists of the determiner \u201cthe\u201d and the\nproper nominal \u201cBronx\u201d. According to a compositional\naccount of its meaning, it should refer to the most salient entity\ncalled \u201cBronx\u201d. However, the northernmost borough of New\nYork City is not called \u201cBronx\u201d; it is called \u201cthe\nBronx\u201d. Furthermore, despite the fact that this borough is\ncalled the Bronx, we do not refer to it using an expression that\ncombines a phrase that expresses this metalinguistic property with a\ndefinite determiner, as the compositional theory would predict. We\ndon\u2019t use \u201cthe the Bronx\u201d, which might be seen as\nsuch a combination (with \u201cthe Bronx\u201d expressing the\nproperty of being called the Bronx). Nor is it plausible that\n\u201cthe Bronx\u201d sports a covert definite determiner, as the\novert \u201cthe\u201d is not fused with \u201cBronx\u201d into a\nproper nominal phrase, but is dropped in such expressions as \u201ca\nBronx resident\u201d.\n\nThis drawback of the metalinguistic theory is concealed when we\nrestrict our consideration to proper names that can\noccur\u2014optionally or obligatorily\u2014without an article, names\nsuch as \u201cAlice\u201d or \u201c(the) George Washington\nBridge\u201d. The George Washington Bridge also happens to be called\nGeorge Washington Bridge\u2014in the sense that people also refer to\nit this way (and attribute the name sans article to it). But this\nappears an accident of naming, rather than a vindication of the\ncompositional view. There are many names that fit the formula of\n\u201cthe Bronx\u201d instead. The World Cup is not, properly\nspeaking, called (just) World Cup; the Eiffel Tower is not called\nEiffel Tower (the way Sears Tower is); the Mona Lisa is not called\nMona Lisa (though its subject, Lisa del Giocondo, was; and\ninterestingly, we would say that the painting is titled Mona\nLisa).\n\nThe situation is different if we confine our attention to personal\nnames. As mentioned earlier, in many languages outside English,\npersonal names come with a (definite) determiner. Matushansky (2008:\n580\u2013581) provides evidence for a cross-linguistic pattern of\ndropping the determiner on personal names in naming environments like\n\u201cis called\u201d, just as the compositional account would\npredict.\n\nA problem remains even for a curtailed version of the metalinguistic\nview on which it applies only to personal names. It can be brought out\nwith data from English. It was originally claimed that \u201cthe\nAlice\u201d (with neutral stress on \u201cthe\u201d) was\nungrammatical, and hence that \u201cAlice\u201d accompanied by a\nnull determiner with the same meaning as \u201cthe\u201d filled its\nslot in the paradigm (Sloat 1969). However, \u201cthe Alice\u201d is\nnot ungrammatical, merely unusual. It is used when the possession of\nthe relevant metalinguistic property is particularly prominent. For\ninstance, when sorting people into groups based on their names, or\ncollecting examples of people with a particular name (Jeshion 2017:\n235; Gray 2017: 452).\n\nCritics of the metalinguistic view have noted subtle differences in\ninterpretation that prevent us from treating \u201cAlice\u201d as\nequivalent to the more clearly metalinguistic phrase \u201cthe\nAlice\u201d. In each pair below, the (b) member allows the individual\nwho counts as the Alice to vary with the occasion, while the (a)\nmember doesn\u2019t (Hawthorne & Manley 2012: 236\u2013237; Fara\n2015c; Schoubye 2016).\n\n(13)\n\na.\nIn every race, Alice won.\nb.\nIn every race, the Alice won.\n\n(14)\n\na.\nAlice always cheats.\nb.\nThe Alice always cheats.\n\n\n\nAnother difference is that \u201cthe Alice\u201d licenses subsequent\none-anaphora, while \u201cAlice\u201d does not (King 2006; Jeshion\n2017: 238):\n\n(15)\n\na. You\u2019re too late. The Alice just left\n    \u2026but maybe another one will show up.\nb. You\u2019re too late. Alice just left \u2026but\n    maybe another one will show up.\n\n\n\nA natural explanation of these differences is that a compositional\nsemantics on which the proper nominal contribute a metalinguistic\nproperty is correct for \u201cthe Alice\u201d, but not for\n\u201cAlice\u201d.\n",
