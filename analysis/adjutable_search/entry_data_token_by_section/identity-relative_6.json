    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n2.5 The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n\nImagine a wooden ship restored by replacing all its planks and beams\n(and other parts) by new ones. Plutarch reports that such a ship\nwas\n\n\n\u2026 a model for the philosophers with respect to the disputed\narguments \u2026 some of them saying it remained the same, some of\nthem saying it did not remain the same. (Plutarch, Life of\nTheseus, 23; translated by Michael Rea in Rea 1995, p. 531).\n\n\nHobbes added the catch that the old parts are reassembled to create\nanother ship exactly like the original. Both the restored ship and the\nreassembled one appear to qualify equally to be the original. In the\none case, the original is \u201cremodeled\u201d, in the other, it is\nreassembled. Yet the two resulting ships are clearly not the same\nship.\n\nSome have proposed that in a case like this our ordinary\n\u201ccriteria of identity\u201d fail us. The process of dismantling\nand reassembling usually preserves identity, as does the process of\npart replacement (otherwise no soldier could be issued just one rifle\nand body shops would function as manufacturers). But in this case the\ntwo processes produce conflicting results: We get two ships, one of\nwhich is the same ship as the original, by one set of criteria, and\nthe other is the original ship, by another set of criteria. There is a\nsimilar conflict of criteria in the case of personal identity: Brain\nduplication scenarios (Wiggins 1967, Parfit 1984) suggest that it is\nlogically possible for one person to split into two competitors, each\nwith equal claim to be the original person. We take it for granted\nthat brain duplication will preserve the psychological properties\nnormally relevant to reidentifying persons and we also take it for\ngranted that the original brain continues to embody these properties\neven after it is duplicated. In this sense there is a conflict of\ncriteria. Such a case of \u201cfission\u201d gives us two distinct\nembodiments of these properties.\n\nPerhaps we should conclude that identity is not what matters. Instead,\nwhat matters is some other relation, but one that accounts as\nreadily as identity for such facts as that the owner of the original\nship would be entitled to both the restored version and the\nreassembled one. For the case of personal identity, Parfit (1984)\ndevelops such a response in detail. A related reaction would be to\nclaim that if both competitors have equal claim to be the original,\nthen neither is the original. If, however, one competitor is\ninferior, then the other wins the day and counts as the original. It\nseems that on this view certain contingencies can establish or falsify\nidentity claims. That conflicts with NI. Suppose that \\(w\\) is a\npossible world in which no ship is assembled from the discarded parts\nof the remodeled ship. In this world, then, the remodeled ship is the\noriginal. By NI, the restored ship and the original are identical in\nthe actual world, contrary to the claim of the \u201cbest\ncandidate\u201d doctrine (which says that neither the remodeled nor\nthe reassembled ship is the original). There are, however, more\nsophisticated \u201cbest candidate\u201d theories that are not\nvulnerable to this objection (Nozick 1982).\n\nSome are convinced that the remodeled ship has the best claim to be\nthe original, since it exhibits a greater degree of spatio-temporal\ncontinuity with the original (Wiggins 1967). But it is unclear why the\nintuition that identity is preserved by spatio-temporal continuity\nshould take precedence over the intuition that identity is preserved\nin the process of dismantlement and reassembly. Furthermore, certain\nversions of the ship of Theseus problem do not involve the feature\nthat one of the ships competing to be the original possesses a greater\ndegree of spatio-temporal continuity with the original than does the\nother (see below). Others are equally convinced that identity is\nnot preserved by total part replacement. This view is often\nsuggested blindly, as a stab in the dark, but there is in fact an\ninteresting argument in its favor. Kripke (1980) argues that a table\nmade out of a particular hunk of wood could not have been\nmade out of a (totally) different hunk of wood. His reasoning is this:\nSuppose that in the actual world a table \\(T\\) is made out of a hunk\nof wood \\(H\\); and suppose that there is a possible world \\(w\\) in\nwhich this very table, \\(T\\), is made out of a different hunk of wood,\n\\(H'\\). Then assuming that \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) are completely unrelated\n(for example, they do not overlap), so that making a table out of the\none is not somehow dependent upon making a table out of the other,\nthere is another possible world \\(w'\\) in which \\(T\\), as in the\nactual world, is made out of \\(H\\), and another table \\(T'\\), exactly\nsimilar to \\(T\\), is made out of \\(H'\\). Since \\(T\\) and \\(T'\\) are\nnot identical in \\(w'\\), it follows by ND that the table made out of\n\\(H'\\) in \\(w\\) is not \\(T\\). Note, however, that the argument assumes\nthat the table made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w'\\) is the same table as the\ntable made out of \\(H'\\) in \\(w\\).\n\nKripke\u2019s reasoning can be applied to the present case (Kripke\nand others might dispute this claim; see below). Let \\(w\\) be a\npossible world just like the actual world in that \\(O\\), the original\nship, is manufactured exactly as it is in the actual world. In \\(w\\),\nhowever, another ship, \\(S'\\), exactly similar to \\(O\\), is\nsimultaneously built out of precisely the same parts that \\(S\\), the\nremodeled ship, is built out of in the actual world. Since \\(S'\\) and\n\\(O\\) are clearly different ships in \\(w\\), it follows by ND that\n\\(O\\) and \\(S\\) are not the same ship in the actual world. Note again\nthat the argument assumes that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are the same ship, but\nit seems quite a stretch to deny that. Nevertheless, some have done\nso. Carter (1987) claims (in effect) that \\(S\\) and \\(S'\\) are not\nidentical, but his argument simply assumes that \\(O\\) and\n\\(S\\) are the same ship. Alternatively, one might view the (Kripkean)\nargument as showing only that while \\(S\\) is the same ship as \\(O\\) in\nthe actual world, \\(S\\) (that is, \\(S')\\) is not the same ship as\n\\(O\\) in \\(w\\). But this is not an option for one who adheres to the\nstandard account and hence adheres to ND. In defending this view,\nhowever, Gallois (1986, 1988) suggests a weakened notion of rigid\ndesignation and a corresponding weakened formulation of ND. (See\nCarter 1987 for criticism of Gallois\u2019 proposals. See also\nChandler 1975 for a precursor of Gallois\u2019 argument.)\n\nIf we grant that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship, we seem to\nhave a solution to the ship of Theseus paradox. By the Kripkean\nargument, only the reassembled ship has any claim to being the\noriginal ship, \\(O\\). But this success is short-lived. For we are left\nwith the following additional paradox: Suppose that \\(S\\) eventuates\nfrom \\(O\\) by replacing one part of \\(O\\) one day at a time. There\nseems to be widespread agreement that replacing just one part of a\nthing by a new exactly similar part preserves the identity of the\nthing. If so, then, by the transitivity of identity, \\(O\\) and \\(S\\)\nmust be the same ship. It follows that either the Kripkean argument is\nincorrect, or replacement of even a single part (or small portion)\ndoes not preserve identity (a view known as \u201cmereological\nessentialism\u201d; Chisholm 1973).\n\nAs indicated, Kripke denies that his argument (for the necessity of\norigin) applies to the case of change over time: \u201cThe question\nwhether the table could have changed into ice is irrelevant\nhere\u201d (Kripke 1972, p. 351). So the question whether \\(O\\) could\nchange into \\(S\\) is supposedly \u201cirrelevant\u201d. But Kripke\ndoes not give a reason for this claim, and if cases of trans-temporal\nidentity and trans-world identity differ markedly in relevant\nrespects\u2014respects relevant to Kripke\u2019s argument for the\nnecessity of origin\u2014it is not obvious what they are. (But see\nForbes 1985, and Lewis 1986, for discussion.) The argument above was\nsimply that \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship since there is a\npossible world in which they differ. If this argument is incorrect it\nis no doubt because there are conclusive reasons showing that \\(S\\)\nand \\(S'\\) differ. Even so, such reasons are clearly not\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d. One may suspect that, if applied to the\ntrans-temporal case, Kripke\u2019s reasoning will yield an argument\nfor mereological essentialism. Indeed, a trans-world counterpart of\nsuch an argument has been tried (Chandler 1976, though Chandler views\nhis argument somewhat differently). In its effect, this argument does\nnot differ essentially from the \u201cparadox\u201d sketched in the\nprevious paragraph (which may well be viewed as an argument for\nmereological essentialism). Subsequent commentators, e.g., Salmon\n(1979) and Chandler (1975, 1976), do not seem to take Kripke\u2019s\nadmonition of irrelevance seriously.\n\nIn any case, there \\(is\\) a close connection between the two issues\n(the ship of Theseus problem and the question of the necessity of\norigin). This can be seen (though it may already be clear) by\nconsidering a modified version of the ship of Theseus problem. Suppose\nthat when \\(O\\) is built, another ship \\(O'\\), exactly like \\(O\\), is\nalso built. Suppose that \\(O'\\) never sets sail, but instead is used\nas a kind of graphic repair manual and parts repository for \\(O\\).\nOver time, planks are removed from \\(O'\\) and used to replace\ncorresponding planks of \\(O\\). The result is a ship \\(S\\) made wholly\nof planks from \\(O'\\) and standing (in the end), we may suppose, in\nexactly the place \\(O'\\) has always stood. Now do \\(O\\) and \\(O'\\)\nhave equal claim to be \\(S\\)? And can we then declare that neither is\n\\(S\\)? Not according to the Kripkean line of thought. It looks for all\nthe world as though the process of \u201cremodeling\u201d \\(O\\) is\nreally just an elaborate means of dismantling and reassembling \\(O'\\).\nAnd if \\(O'\\) and \\(S\\) are the same ship, then since \\(O\\) and \\(O'\\)\nare distinct, \\(O\\) and \\(S\\) cannot be the same ship.\n\nThis argument is vulnerable to the following two important criticisms:\nFirst, it conflicts with the common sense principle that (1) the\nmaterial of an object can be totally replenished or replaced without\naffecting its identity (Salmon 1979); and secondly, as mentioned, it\nconflicts with the additional common sense principle that (2)\nreplacement by a single part or small portion preserves identity.\nThese objections may seem to provide sufficient grounds for rejecting\nthe Kripkean argument and perhaps restricting the application of\nKripke\u2019s original argument for the necessity of origin (Noonan\n1983). There is, however, a rather striking problem with (2), and it\nis unclear whether the conflict between (1) and the Kripkean argument\nshould be resolved in favor of the former.\n\nThe problem with (2) is this. Pick a simple sort of objects, say,\nshoes, or better, sandals. Suppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two exactly\nsimilar sandals, one of which \\((A)\\) is brand new and the other\n\\((B)\\) is worn out. Each consists of a top strap and a sole, nothing\nmore. If \\(B\\)\u2019s worn strap is replaced by \\(A\\)\u2019s new\none, (2) dictates that the resulting sandal is \\(B\\)\n\u201crefurbished\u201d. In fact, if the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare simply exchanged, (2) dictates that the sandal with the new parts,\n\\(A'\\), is \\(B\\) and the sandal with the old parts, \\(B'\\), is \\(A\\).\nIt follows by ND that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) and \\(B\\) and \\(B'\\) are\ndistinct. This is surely the wrong result. The intuition that \\(A\\)\nand \\(A'\\) are the same sandal is very strong; and the process of\nexchanging the parts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) seems to amount to nothing\nmore than the dismantling and reassembling of each. This example is no\ndifferent in principle than the more elaborate trans-world cases\ndiscussed by Chisholm (1967), Chandler (1976), Salmon (1979), or Gupta\n(1980). (One who claims that \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) differ in that \\(A'\\)\ncomes into existence after \\(A\\), does not have much to go on. \\(A\\)\ncannot be supposed to persist after \\(A'\\) comes into existence. We do\nnot end up with two new sandals and one old one. Why then\ncouldn\u2019t it be \\(A\\) itself that reappears at the later\ntime?)\n",
