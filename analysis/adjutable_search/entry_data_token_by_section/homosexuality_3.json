Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality\n\nWith the rise of the gay liberation movement in the post-Stonewall\nera, overtly gay and lesbian perspectives began to be put forward in\npolitics, philosophy and literary theory. Initially these often were\novertly linked to feminist analyses of patriarchy (e.g., Rich, 1980)\nor other, earlier approaches to theory. Yet in the late 1980s and\nearly 1990s queer theory was developed, although there are obviously\nimportant antecedents which make it difficult to date it precisely.\nThere are a number of ways in which queer theory differed from earlier\ngay liberation theory, but an important initial difference becomes\napparent once we examine the reasons for opting for employing the term\n\u2018queer\u2019 as opposed to \u2018gay and lesbian.\u2019 Some\nversions of, for example, lesbian theory portrayed the essence of\nlesbian identity and sexuality in very specific terms:\nnon-hierarchical, consensual, and, specifically in terms of sexuality,\nas not necessarily focused upon genitalia (e.g., Faderman, 1985).\nLesbians arguing from this framework, for example, could very well\ncriticize natural law theorists as inscribing into the very \u201claw\nof nature\u201d an essentially masculine sexuality, focused upon the\ngenitals, penetration, and the status of the male orgasm (natural law\ntheorists rarely mention female orgasms).\n\nThis approach, based upon characterizations of \u2018lesbian\u2019\nand \u2018gay\u2019 identity and sexuality, however, suffered from\nthree difficulties. First, it appeared even though the goal was to\ncritique a heterosexist regime for its exclusion and marginalization\nof those whose sexuality is different, any specific or\n\u201cessentialist\u201d account of gay or lesbian sexuality had the\nsame effect. Sticking with the example used above, of a specific\nconceptualization of lesbian identity, it denigrates women who are\nsexually and emotionally attracted to other women, yet who do not fit\nthe description. Sado-masochists and butch/fem lesbians arguably do\nnot fit this ideal of \u2018equality\u2019 offered. A second problem\nwas that by placing such an emphasis upon the gender of one\u2019s\nsexual partner(s), other possible important sources of identity are\nmarginalized, such as race and ethnicity. What may be of utmost\nimportance, for example, for a black lesbian is her lesbianism, rather\nthan her race. Many gays and lesbians of color attacked this approach,\naccusing it of re-inscribing an essentially white identity into the\nheart of gay or lesbian identity (Jagose, 1996).\n\nThe third and final problem for the gay liberationist approach was\nthat it often took this category of \u2018identity\u2019 itself as\nunproblematic and unhistorical. Such a view, however, largely because\nof arguments developed within poststructuralism, seemed increasingly\nuntenable. The key figure in the attack upon identity as ahistorical\nis Michel Foucault. In a series of works he set out to analyze the\nhistory of sexuality from ancient Greece to the modern era (1980,\n1985, 1986). Although the project was tragically cut short by his\ndeath in 1984, from complications arising from AIDS, Foucault\narticulated how profoundly understandings of sexuality can vary across\ntime and space, and his arguments have proven very influential in gay\nand lesbian theorizing in general, and queer theory in particular\n(Spargo, 1999; Stychin, 2005).\n\nOne of the reasons for the historical review above is that it helps to\ngive some background for understanding the claim that sexuality is\nsocially constructed, rather than given by nature. Moreover, in order\nto not prejudge the issue of social constructionism versus\nessentialism, I avoided applying the term \u2018homosexual\u2019 to\nthe ancient or medieval eras. In ancient Greece the gender of\none\u2019s partner(s) was not important, but instead whether one took\nthe active or passive role. In the medieval view, a\n\u2018sodomite\u2019 was a person who succumbed to temptation and\nengaged in certain non-procreative sex acts. Although the gender of\nthe partner was more important in the medieval than in the ancient\nview, the broader theological framework placed the emphasis upon a sin\nversus refraining-from-sin dichotomy. With the rise of the notion of\n\u2018homosexuality\u2019 in the modern era, a person is placed into\na specific category even if one does not act upon those inclinations.\nIt is difficult to perceive a common, natural sexuality expressed\nacross these three very different cultures. The social constructionist\ncontention is that there is no \u2018natural\u2019 sexuality; all\nsexual understandings are constructed within and mediated by cultural\nunderstandings. The examples can be pushed much further by\nincorporating anthropological data outside of the Western tradition\n(Halperin, 1990; Greenberg, 1988). Yet even within the narrower\ncontext offered here, the differences between them are striking. The\nassumption in ancient Greece was that men (less is known about Greek\nattitudes towards women) can respond erotically to either sex, and the\nvast majority of men who engaged in same-sex relationships were also\nmarried (or would later become married). Yet the contemporary\nunderstanding of homosexuality divides the sexual domain in two,\nheterosexual and homosexual, and most heterosexuals cannot respond\nerotically to their own sex.\n\nIn saying that sexuality is a social construct, these theorists are\nnot saying that these understandings are not real. Since persons are\nalso constructs of their culture (in this view), we are made into\nthose categories. Hence today persons of course understand themselves\nas straight or gay (or perhaps bisexual), and it is very difficult to\nstep outside of these categories, even once one comes to see them as\nthe historical constructs they are.\n\nGay and lesbian theory was thus faced with three significant problems,\nall of which involved difficulties with the notion of\n\u2018identity.\u2019 Queer theory arose in large part as an attempt\nto overcome them. How queer theory does so can be seen by looking at\nthe term \u2018queer\u2019 itself. In contrast to gay or lesbian,\n\u2018queer,\u2019 it is argued, does not refer to an essence,\nwhether of a sexual nature or not. Instead it is purely relational,\nstanding as an undefined term that gets its meaning precisely by being\nthat which is outside of the norm, however that norm itself may be\ndefined. As one of the most articulate queer theorists puts it:\n\u201cQueer is \u2026 whatever is at odds with the normal,\nthe legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to\nwhich it necessarily refers. It is an identity without an\nessence\u201d (Halperin, 1995, 62, original emphasis). By lacking any\nessence, queer does not marginalize those whose sexuality is outside\nof any gay or lesbian norm, such as sado-masochists. Since specific\nconceptualizations of sexuality are avoided, and hence not put at the\ncenter of any definition of queer, it allows more freedom for\nself-identification for, say, black lesbians to identify as much or\nmore with their race (or any other trait, such as involvement in an S\n& M subculture) than with lesbianism. Finally, it incorporates the\ninsights of poststructuralism about the difficulties in ascribing any\nessence or non-historical aspect to identity.\n\nThis central move by queer theorists, the claim that the categories\nthrough which identity is understood are all social constructs rather\nthan given to us by nature, opens up a number of analytical\npossibilities. For example, queer theorists examine how fundamental\nnotions of gender and sex which seem so natural and self-evident to\npersons in the modern West are in fact constructed and reinforced\nthrough everyday actions, and that this occurs in ways that privilege\nheterosexuality (Butler, 1990, 1993). Also examined are medical\ncategories, such as \u2018inverts\u2019 and intersexuality, which\nare themselves socially constructed (Fausto-Sterling, 2000, is an\nerudite example of this, although she is not ultimately a queer\ntheorist). Others examine how language and especially divisions\nbetween what is said and what is not said, corresponding to the\ndichotomy between \u2018closeted\u2019 and \u2018out,\u2019\nespecially in regards to the modern division of\nheterosexual/homosexual, structure much of modern thought. That is, it\nis argued that when we look at dichotomies such as natural/artificial,\nor masculine/feminine, we find in the background an implicit reliance\nupon a very recent, and arbitrary, understanding of the sexual world\nas split into two species (Sedgwick, 1990). The fluidity of categories\ncreated through queer theory even opens the possibility of new sorts\nof histories that examine previously silent types of affections and\nrelationships (Carter, 2005).\n\nAnother critical perspective opened up by a queer approach, although\ncertainly implicit in those just referred to, is especially important.\nSince most anti-gay and lesbian arguments rely upon the alleged\nnaturalness of heterosexuality, queer theorists attempt to show how\nthese categories are themselves deeply social constructs. An example\nhelps to illustrate the approach. In an essay against gay marriage,\nchosen because it is very representative, James Q. Wilson (1996)\ncontends that gay men have a \u201cgreat tendency\u201d to be\npromiscuous. In contrast, he puts forward loving, monogamous marriage\nas the natural condition of heterosexuality. Heterosexuality, in his\nargument, is an odd combination of something completely natural yet\nsimultaneously endangered. One is born straight, yet this natural\ncondition can be subverted by such things as the presence of gay\ncouples, gay teachers, or even excessive talk about homosexuality.\nWilson\u2019s argument requires a radical disjunction between\nheterosexuality and homosexuality. If gayness is radically different,\nit is legitimate to suppress it. Wilson has the courage to be\nforthright about this element of his argument; he comes out against\n\u201cthe political imposition of tolerance\u201d towards gays and\nlesbians (Wilson, 1996, 35).\n\nIt is a common move in queer theory to bracket, at least temporarily,\nissues of truth and falsity (Halperin, 1995). Instead, the analysis\nfocuses on the social function of discourse. Questions of who counts\nas an expert and why, and concerns about the effects of the\nexpert\u2019s discourse are given equal status to questions of the\nverity of what is said. This approach reveals that hidden underneath\nWilson\u2019s (and other anti-gay) work is an important\nepistemological move. Since heterosexuality is the natural condition,\nit is a place that is spoken from but not inquired into. In contrast,\nhomosexuality is the aberration and hence it needs to be studied but\nit is not an authoritative place from which one can speak. By virtue\nof this heterosexual privilege, Wilson is allowed the voice of the\nimpartial, fair-minded expert. Yet, as the history section above\nshows, there are striking discontinuities in understandings of\nsexuality, and this is true to the point that, according to queer\ntheorists, we should not think of sexuality as having any particular\nnature at all. Through undoing our infatuation with any specific\nconception of sexuality, the queer theorist opens space for\nmarginalized forms of sexuality, and thus of ways of being more\ngenerally.\n\nThe insistence that we must investigate the ways in which categories\nsuch as sexuality and orientation are created and given power through\nscience and other cultural mechanisms has made queer theory appealing\nto scholars in a variety of disciplines. Historians and sociologists\nhave drawn on it, which is perhaps unsurprising given the role of\nhistorical claims about the social construction of sexuality. Queer\ntheory has been especially influential in literary studies and\nfeminist theory, even though the dividing lines between the latter and\nqueer thinking is contested (see Jagose, 2009; Marinucci, 2010). One\nof the most prominent scholars working in the area of gay and lesbian\nissues in constitutional law has also drawn on queer theory to advance\nhis interrogation of the ways that US law privileges heterosexuality\n(Eskridge, 1999). Scholars in postcolonial and racial analyses,\nethnography, American studies, and other fields have drawn on the\nconceptual tools provided by queer theory.\n\nDespite its roots in postmodernism and Foucault\u2019s work in\nparticular, queer theory\u2019s reception in France was initially\nhostile (see Eribon, 2004). The core texts from the first\n\u2018wave\u2019 of queer theory, such as Judith Butler\u2019s and\nEve Sedgwick\u2019s central works, were slow to appear in French\ntranslation, not coming out until a decade and a half after their\noriginal publication. Doubtless the French republican\nself-understanding, which is universalist and often hostile to\nmovements that are multicultural in their bent, was a factor in the\nslow and often strenuously resisted importation of queer theoretical\ninsights. Similarly, queer theory has also been on the margins in\nGerman philosophy and political philosophy. In sum, it is fair to say\nthat queer theory has had a greater impact in the Anglo-American\nworld.\n\nQueer theory, however, has been criticized in a myriad of ways\n(Jagose, 1996). One set of criticisms comes from theorists who are\nsympathetic to gay liberation conceived as a project of radical social\nchange. An initial criticism is that precisely because\n\u2018queer\u2019 does not refer to any specific sexual status or\ngender object choice, for example Halperin (1995) allows that straight\npersons may be \u2018queer,\u2019 it robs gays and lesbians of the\ndistinctiveness of what makes them marginal. It desexualizes identity,\nwhen the issue is precisely about a sexual identity (Jagose, 1996). A\nrelated criticism is that queer theory, since it refuses any essence\nor reference to standard ideas of normality, cannot make crucial\ndistinctions. For example, queer theorists usually argue that one of\nthe advantages of the term \u2018queer\u2019 is that it thereby\nincludes transsexuals, sado-masochists, and other marginalized\nsexualities. How far does this extend? Is transgenerational sex (e.g.,\npedophilia) permissible? Are there any limits upon the forms of\nacceptable sado-masochism or fetishism? While some queer theorists\nspecifically disallow pedophilia, it is an open question whether the\ntheory has the resources to support such a distinction. Furthermore,\nsome queer theorists overtly refuse to rule out pedophiles as\n\u2018queer\u2019 (Halperin, 1995, 62) Another criticism is that\nqueer theory, in part because it typically has recourse to a very\ntechnical jargon, is written by a narrow elite for that narrow elite.\nIt is therefore class biased and also, in practice, only really\nreferred to at universities and colleges (Malinowitz, 1993).\n\nQueer theory is also criticized by those who reject the desirability\nof radical social change. For example, centrist and conservative gays\nand lesbians have criticized a queer approach by arguing that it will\nbe \u201cdisastrously counter-productive\u201d (Bawer, 1996, xii).\nIf \u2018queer\u2019 keeps its connotation of something perverse and\nat odds with mainstream society, which is precisely what most queer\ntheorists want, it would seem to only validate the attacks upon gays\nand lesbians made by conservatives. Sullivan (1996) also criticizes\nqueer theorists for relying upon Foucault\u2019s account of power,\nwhich he argues does not allow for meaningful resistance. It seems\nlikely, however, that Sullivan\u2019s understanding of\nFoucault\u2019s notions of power and resistance is misguided.\n",
