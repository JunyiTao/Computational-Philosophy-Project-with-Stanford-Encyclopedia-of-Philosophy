    "main_text": "Basic DRT || Quantifiers vs. indefinites\n3.2 Quantifiers vs. indefinites\nThe interpretation of quantified donkey sentences is very similar\nto what we have just seen:\n\n[8a]\n Every farmer who\nowns a donkey beats it. \n[8b]\n [1\n: [2 x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y),\nowns(x,y)](\u2200x)[3 v, w: beats(v,w)]\n]\n\nThere are two ways of spelling out the interpretation of\nso-called duplex conditions of the\nform K(\u2200x)K\u2032. On its\nweak interpretation, [8a] means that every farmer who owns a donkey\nbeats at least one of the donkeys he owns; on its strong\ninterpretation the sentence says that every farmer beats every donkey\nhe owns. While the strong reading is the most natural choice for [8a],\nother donkey sentences prefer a weak reading:\n\n[9]\n Every farmer who\nowns a tractor uses it to drive to church on Sundays. \n\nThe most likely interpretation for [9] to have is that every\ntractor-owning farmer uses one of their tractors to drive to church.\nThe distinction between weak and strong interpretations is somewhat\nmysterious, because it doesn\u2019t seem to be an ordinary ambiguity. For\nexample, donkey sentences with existential quantifiers don\u2019t seem to\nlicense strong readings:\n\n[10]\n Some farmers who\nown a donkey beat it. \n\nThis can only be construed as saying that some donkey-owning\nfarmers beat at least one of their donkeys. More generally, the\nuniversally quantified donkey sentences seem to be the only ones to\nlicense both interpretations. It is not entirely clear why this should\nbe the case (see Kanazawa 1994, Geurts 2002).\nWhether weak or strong, the interpretation of a condition of the\nform K(Qx)K\u2032,\nwhere Q may be any quantifier,\nmakes K accessible\nto K\u2032, and in this respect\n(which is the fulcrum of the DRT analysis) conditionals and quantified\nsentences are the same. Consequently, the discourse\nreferents x\nand y in [8b2] are\naccessible to v\nand w in [8b3], and the\nlatter may be equated to the former.  The resulting representation is\n[8c], which is equivalent to [8d].\n\n[8c]\n[1\n: [2 x, y, v, w: v = x, w = y, farmer(x), donkey(y),\nowns(x,y)](\u2200x)[3 : beats(v,w)] ]\n[8d]\n[1\n: [2 x, y: farmer(x), donkey(y),\nowns(x,y)](\u2200x)[3 : beats(x,y)]\u00a0]\n\nThe DRT analysis of quantified expressions like \u201call\u201d\nor \u201cmost\u201d is fairly standard. A quantifier binds a\nvariable and delivers the truth conditions one should\nexpect. Indefinites are different. An indefinite like \u201ca\ndonkey\u201d is treated not as a quantifier but simply as device for\nintroducing a discourse referent and one or more conditions; on the\nDRT account, indefinites have no quantifying force of their own. What\nquantifying force they seem to have is not theirs, but derives from\nthe environment in which they occur. If the semantic material\nassociated with \u201ca donkey\u201d is introduced in the main DRS,\nas in [4c], the quantifying effect will be existential, owing to the\nfact that this DRS is verified in a model M iff there\nis a way of verifying it in M. If the semantic\nmaterial associated with \u201ca donkey\u201d is introduced in the\nantecedent of a conditional, as in [7d], the quantifying effect will\nbe universal, owing to the fact that a\ncondition of the form K\u21d2K\u2032 is\nverified in M iff every way of\nverifying K can be extended to a\nway of verifying K\u2032. This\nview on indefinites lies at the heart of DRT.\nDRT was one of the first semantic theories to go beyond the\nsentence boundary, and take into account how the interpretation of an\nexpression may depend on the preceding discourse. Looking back at the\nexamples discussed in the foregoing, we see that, if the DRT approach\nis on the right track, sentence boundaries are not as important as the\nFregean (or Chomskyan) conception of language would have it. In particular, there is\nessentially no difference between the DRT analysis of cross-sentential\nanaphora, as exemplified by the mini-discourse [2]-[3a], and\nsentence-internal anaphora, as in [7a] or [9a]. In either case, the\npronoun simply serves to pick up an accessible discourse\nreferent. This raises the question of how DRT\u2019s new-fangled notion of\nanaphora relates to the dichotomy between referential and\nbound-variable pronouns.  Curiously, this issue doesn\u2019t seem to have\nreceived much attention yet.\n",
