    "main_text": "Simone Weil\n9. Simone Weil\n\nBefore discussing Murdoch\u2019s notion of attention, some remarks\nabout Weil are in order, because of her profound impact on Murdoch,\nnot only in relation to attention. Simone Weil (1909\u20131943) was a\nFrench philosopher (though never a university professor), political\nactivist, and, in her later (short) life a kind of Christian mystic.\nMurdoch encountered Weil\u2019s writings in the early 1950s, and\nreviewed her Notebooks in 1956 (\u201cKnowing the\nVoid\u201d). Murdoch mentions her only briefly in her earlier\nwritings; Weil, unlike Sartre, was not a figure at all familiar to\nBritish philosophy of those years, and indeed she is still little\nknown to Anglo-American philosophers (see the Stanford Encyclopedia entry on\n Simone Weil).\n But as in the quote above, Murdoch always makes her debt to Weil\nevident. Weil influenced Murdoch\u2019s turn to Platonism, and her\nparticular interpretation of Plato. She certainly bolstered the\ncontinuing Christian elements in Murdoch\u2019s thought, as well as\nMurdoch\u2019s increasing invoking of mysticism as related to\nmorality, especially in Metaphysics. She probably influenced\nMurdoch\u2019s view of psychic energy (understood on a Freudian\nmodel) as \u201cmechanical\u201d, something to which we are\nsubjected. And Murdoch made use of Weil\u2019s notion of\n\u201cvoid\u201d as part her moral outlook in\nMetaphysics.\n\nWeil also developed a quite original critique of Marxism that involved\na strong emphasis on the dignity of manual work, an emphasis of\nMurdoch\u2019s also, in her important political essay, \u201cHouse\nof Theory\u201d, from 1958. Murdoch refers to Weil frequently in\nMetaphysics, though only once in any sustained way. In 1976\nshe cited Weil\u2019s Attente de Dieu (Waiting for\nGod) as one of only three philosophical works that deeply\ninfluenced her. (The others are Plato\u2019s Symposium and\nKierkegaard\u2019s Fear and Trembling [Broackes 2012a: 17,\nnote 42].)\n\nBut Weil\u2019s strongest influence on Murdoch was in the idea of\nattention (Weil 1942 [1977]; 1973b). Weil\u2019s view of attention\nhad a strong religious dimension. The proper, ultimate object of\nattention is God, though persons and subject matters are also objects\nof attention. Weil\u2019s notion of attention also involves a kind of\npassive waiting in readiness for a truth to be revealed, an emptying\nof oneself in preparation for receiving the object. Murdoch abandoned\nthe religious aspect of Weil\u2019s view of attention, as she also\nabandoned for herself the distinctly theistic aspects of Weil\u2019s\nChristianity, and also adopted a more active conception of attention\nthan Weil.  (Forsberg argues that Murdoch\u2019s view was closer to\nWeil\u2019s regarding passivity/activity [Forsberg 2017]. See also\nCordner 2016.)  But their notions were otherwise \n similar.[5]\n\n",
