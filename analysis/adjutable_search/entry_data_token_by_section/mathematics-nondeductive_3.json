    "main_text": "Introduction || Deductivism and Foundations\n1.3 Deductivism and Foundations\n\nIn addition to the development of formal logic, another aspect of\ndeductivism is its emphasis on \u2018foundations\u2019. The reason\nfor this is that the passage from axioms to theorem is\nstraightforward, in principle, since it is a matter of logical\nderivation. Indeed there is nothing distinctively mathematical\ninvolved in this transition. Hence attention is shifted to the\nstarting point of the deductive process, namely the axioms. And if\nthese axioms are themselves theorems of some more basic theory, then\nthis pursuit of a secure starting point can be pursued down through a\nhierarchy of ever more foundational mathematical theories.\n\nIt is undeniable that issues in the foundations of mathematics have\nbeen the central preoccupation of philosophers of mathematics through\nmost of the 20th Century. This is not, of course, because\nfoundational areas such as set theory are the only areas of\nmathematics where philosophers think that deduction takes place, but\nrather because\u2014as pointed out above\u2014focusing on deduction\nputs particular emphasis on the starting points of proofs. Even those\nsympathetic with this focus on foundational issues are likely to\nacknowledge that many areas of mathematical practice are thereby\nignored. The question is what\u2014if anything\u2014of philosophical\ninterest is lost in the process.\n",
