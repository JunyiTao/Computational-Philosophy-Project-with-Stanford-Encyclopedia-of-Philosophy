    "main_text": "Efficacious Ideas\n5. Efficacious Ideas\n\nMalebranche is a philosopher whose thought developed markedly over\ntime. In part this was due to his lively engagement with critics and\nhis attempts to respond to their objections, and also to his\nrecognition that his doctrines required further articulation than he\nhad provided in earlier writings. One of the most significant\ndevelopments to the theory of Vision in God was the view that ideas\nare causally efficacious. Malebranche had already argued that ideas\nhave properties \u2013 necessity, eternality, immutability,\nuniversality, etc. \u2013 but in response to an objection by his\nCartesian critic Pierre-Sylvain R\u00e9gis, he came to ascribe\ncausal powers to them as well. This new theory is introduced in the\ncontext of the claim that the mind is united to God, even in this\nlife. It is because of this union, Malebranche maintains, that Vision\nin God is possible. We are always in immediate contact with being in\ngeneral and so can focus our attention on the idea of intelligible\nextension at any time or immediately perceive it in sense\nperception.\n\nR\u00e9gis was rightly curious about the nature of this union with\nGod. Malebranche had spoken metaphorically of the\n\u2018presence\u2019 of God to the mind, but without ever specifying\nwhat he meant. R\u00e9gis noted that this union cannot be understood\non the model of the union of one body with another, for that requires\nactual physical contact; nor should it be thought to resemble the\nmind\u2019s union with the body, for that would make the mind and God\nmutually dependent on each other, and the infinite being depends on\nnothing. No, R\u00e9gis argued, the only viable way to understand\nthe God-mind union is on the model of cause to effect, respectively.\nAt this point he uncovers an important objection that he had been\nanticipating: if mind-God union is to be understood causally, then it\nis still possible that we perceive bodies by means of ideas that are\nin us, but caused by bodies themselves, as Descartes himself had\ntaught (SG 1:188; also see Schmaltz 2000, 76\u20137).\n\nIn his response, Malebranche attempts to exploit R\u00e9gis\u2019\nsuggestion but without leaving the door open to Cartesianism. Lacking\ncausal efficacy and being \u2018invisible\u2019 in themselves,\nbodies cannot act directly on the mind in the way that R\u00e9gis\nhad indicated. In virtue of being in God, however, the idea of\nextension can \u2018affect\u2019 or \u2018touch\u2019 the mind in\nvarious ways (OC 17\u20131, 282\u20133). In changes made to\npreviously published works, two years later (1695), Malebranche even\nmore explicitly ties the intelligibility of ideas to their causal\nefficacy (Robinet 1965, 259, note 2). Readers are told for the first\ntime that the reason ideas are intelligible and bodies are not is\nbecause only the former can act on the mind.\n\nThe theory that ideas are efficacious becomes Malebranche\u2019s\nmature position, and to mark this development changes are made to\nlater editions of the Search and to other writings. With the\nadvent of this theory, it becomes easier to see the relation between\nVision in God and Malebranche\u2019s other main doctrine of\nOccasionalism, or the view that God is the only genuine cause. Indeed,\none can regard Vision in God as a corollary to Occasionalism. As the\nonly true cause, God produces minds, bodies, and the various changes\nthey endure. The mind\u2019s nature is to think and to perceive, and\nGod produces those modifications via ideas, which are the instruments\nby which he enlightens us.\n\nMake no mistake about it, the theory of efficacious ideas marks a\nsignificant development in the doctrine of Vision in God. One\ncommentator aptly notes that Malebranche\u2019s epistemology shifts\nfrom being a vision in God to a vision by God\n(Alqui\u00e9 1974, 209). Ideas are no longer the direct objects of\nperception, passively awaiting our reflection upon them, but the\nactive agents of cognition. Moreover, whereas on Malebranche\u2019s\nearlier view ideas figured exclusively in the intellectual side of\nperception, on the new version of the doctrine they cause both our\nsensations and what he came to call our \u2018pure perceptions\u2019\n(perceptions pures). Malebranche had been reluctant\npreviously to say that ideas are \u2018sensible\u2019 lest he\nattribute colors and other sensible qualities to God. But on the\nrevamped doctrine he can say that ideas are both sensible and\nintelligible insofar as they causally affect our mind in different\nways (Schmaltz 2000, 80). \u2018When the idea of extension affects or\nmodifies the soul with a pure perception, then the soul conceives\nsimply this extension. But when the idea of extension touches the soul\nmore sharply, and affects it with a sense perception, then the soul\nsees, or senses extension\u2019 (Christian Conversations3,\nOC 4:75\u20136). Thus, the theory of efficacious ideas enables\nMalebranche to offer a more unified theory of cognition.\n",
