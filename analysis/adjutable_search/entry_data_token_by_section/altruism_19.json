Sentimentalism revisited\n\nWe are now in a better position to sort through the package of ideas\nlabeled \u201csentimentalism\u201d in preceding sections, and to\nrecognize that some are far more plausible than others.\n\nFirst, we should accept the sentimentalist thesis that one\u2019s\nfeelings can be assessed as fitting or unfitting on grounds other than\ntheir causal effect on one\u2019s actions. We should, for example,\ncare about what happens to our children even when we can do nothing to\nhelp them; that emotional response is appropriate because it is part\nof what it is to be a good parent. This point allows us to concede\nthat in certain situations one ought to try to suppress an emotional\nresponse that would normally be appropriate. If one has a duty to\nminister to many people who are suffering, one may be more effective\nin aiding them if one keeps oneself from feeling the emotions that are\nfitting. A nurse working in a war zone, for example, might save more\nlives if she trains herself, for now, to feel little emotion when she\nhears the moans and cries of the wounded. She has reason to feel\ncompassion, but that is overridden by stronger reasons to act\neffectively to relieve their burden.\n\nA closely related sentimentalist point that should be accepted is that\naiding someone in need, but doing so in a manifestly cold, affectless,\nor hostile manner is, in many situations, a defective response.\n\nA second idea associated with sentimentalism in\n section 4.4\n was this: \n\n\nwhat is most important in human relationships cannot be captured by an\napproach that begins with a general rule about how to treat others,\nand justifies a certain way of treating each particular individual\nsimply by applying that general rule.\n\n\nThe kernel of truth in this statement is that some of the most\nvaluable components of our lives are not available by following a\nrule. We do not fall in love with people by applying a general\nprinciple, standard, or criterion about whom we ought to fall in love\nwith. We do not develop a passion for mathematics, or history, or\ntennis, by seeing these pursuits as specific instances of something\nmore general that we care about. Some of the most valuable components\nof our lives are available to us only if they arise spontaneously from\nfeelings that respond to the lovable features of the world or the\npeople in it.\n\nBut that leaves a great deal of room for the project of treating\npeople in accordance with rules that we accept because they survive\nour rational scrutiny. For example, it would be absurd to suggest that\nwe should abstain from torturing someone if (but only if) we have an\nuntutored and negative emotional reaction to torturing him. With\nrespect to torture, we need to respond to a general question: are\nthere circumstances in which it would be justified? (And to answer\nthat question, we must first ask: what is torture?) The only way to\naddress these questions is one in which we reason our way towards a\ngeneral policy\u2014a rule, however simple or complex, that governs\nthe use of torture. And surely such a rule should be\nimpartial\u2014it should be a single rule that applies to all, not\ntailored to serve the interests of some nations or factions to which\nwe belong.\n\nThe same point applies to questions about everyday rules that govern\nsuch acts as promise-keeping, lying, theft, and other kinds of suspect\nbehavior. Here too we rightly expect each other to have a general\npolicy, one that takes these sorts of actions to be wrong in normal\ncircumstances. That a promise has been freely made is normally a\ndecisive reason for keeping it; someone who keeps a promise only if he\nhas a positive feeling about doing so would not be treating others as\nthey rightly expect to be treated. (For opposing views, see Dancy\n2004; Ridge and McKeever 2006.)\n\nA third question about the relation between our sentiments and\naltruism arises when we ask about the proper basis for charitable\ngiving. Consider, for example, someone who donates money to an\norganization devoted to fighting cancer, and chooses to do so because\nhis mother has died of cancer. His gift is an expression of his love\nfor her; it is meant, of course, to do good to others, but those\nothers are chosen as beneficiaries because he takes the reduction of\nthis disease to be an appropriate expression of his feelings for her.\nUtilitarianism cannot easily accept this form of altruism, since it\nbegins with the premise that charitable acts, like everything else,\nare right only if they do the most good\u2014and it could easily be\nthe case that money allocated to cancer research would do more good if\ndonated to some other humanitarian cause. But if one does not\npresuppose the truth of utilitarianism, it is not difficult to defend\nthe practice of choosing one charity over another on the basis of\none\u2019s sentimental attachments. If friendships and other loving\nrelationships have a proper place in our lives even if they do not\nmaximize the good, then sentiment is an appropriate basis for\naltruism. (For an opposing view, see Singer 2015.)\n\nThat does not entail that it is always right to follow our feelings\nwhen we decide whether to help this person or organization rather than\nthat. Suppose you belong to a group dedicated to reducing the number\nof people who die in drowning accidents, and you are on your way to an\nessential meeting of this organization. If you miss the meeting, let\nus suppose, the group will have to suspend its operations for many\nmonths\u2014with the result that the number of drownings will remain\nhigh. On your way, you pass a child who is in danger of drowning, and\ncries for your help. You must choose: either you can save this one\nchild, or you can attend the meeting and thereby save many more from\ndrowning. When you hear the child\u2019s cries for help, you cannot\nhelp responding emotionally; it would be cold and calculating to pass him\nby, even if in doing so you will be saving many more. What ought you\nto do?\n\nThe fact that your emotions are fully aroused by the child\u2019s\ncries does not have the same bearing on this issue as does the love\nfelt by a son for his departed mother in the previous example. The\ndrowning child whose cries fill you with compassionate feeling is a\nstranger to you. So your alternatives in this case are whether to help\none stranger (the one who is tugging at your heartstrings) or many\n(whom you do not see or hear at the moment). It would not be\nimplausible to hold that sentiment plays an appropriate role in\naltruism when it is the expression of a long-term and meaningful bond,\nbut not when it is a short-lived reaction to the cries of a\nstranger.\n",
