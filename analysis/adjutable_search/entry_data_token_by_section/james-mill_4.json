    "main_text": "The Essay on Government || Mill on Representation\n4.1 Mill on Representation\nMill\u2019s views on representation stand mid-way between two opposing views. On the one side are Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other \u201cparticipatory\u201d theorists who argue that to allow anyone to represent you or your interests is tantamount to forfeiting your liberty. On the other side are assorted Whig defenders of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d\u2014including Edmund Burke and, later, Mill\u2019s contemporaries Sir James Mackintosh and T. B. Macaulay\u2014who contend that representatives elected by the few may best represent the interests of the many. On their view, one need not have a voice\u2014or a vote\u2014to be well represented in Parliament.\nAgainst Rousseau and other opponents of representation tout court Mill maintains that representative government is \u201cthe grand discovery of modern times,\u201d inasmuch as it allows the interests of the many to be represented efficiently and expeditiously by the few\u2014so long, that is, as the many have the vote in order to register their views and can moreover hold the few strictly accountable for their actions while in office. Properly structured, such a system serves to enhance liberty, since it frees most people from the burdensome and time-consuming business of governing, thereby allowing them to get on with their more productive individual pursuits and, most especially, their productive labors (Mill 1992, 21).\nBut it was against Tory and Whigs who defended \u201cvirtual representation\u201d and advocated slow and piecemeal reform of the representative system that Mill\u2019s main arguments were directed. He holds that the very idea of virtual representation is a recipe for misgovernment, corruption, and the triumph of the aristocratic or \u201csinister interests\u201d of the few at the expense of the many. The public interest can be represented only in so far as the public, or a considerably enlarged portion thereof, has the vote. Mill is a radical individualist in that he insists that each person is the best, perhaps indeed the only, judge of what his own interests are. And if\u2014as he also insists\u2014the public interest is the sum of all individual non-sinister interests, it follows that the wider the franchise, the more truly representative the government. Mill deemed any defense of a greatly restricted franchise and virtual representation to be arguments against representative government itself. Pace Ricardo, Mill had not really managed to avoid giving Government \u201cthe appearance of an essay on Reform of Parliament\u201d (Ricardo 1820, 211).\n",
