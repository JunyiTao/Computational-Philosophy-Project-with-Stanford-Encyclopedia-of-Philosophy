    "main_text": "\n\nFuture contingents are contingent statements about the future \u2014\nsuch as future events, actions, states etc. To qualify as contingent\nthe predicted event, state, action or whatever is at stake must\nneither be impossible nor inevitable. Statements such as \u201cMy\nmother shall go to London\u201d or \u201cThere will be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d could serve as standard examples. What could be called\nthe problem of future contingents concerns how to ascribe truth-values\nto such statements. If there are several possible decisions out of\nwhich one is going to be made freely tomorrow, can there be a truth\nnow about which one will be made? If \u201cyes\u201d, on what\ngrounds could something which is still open, nevertheless be true\nalready now? If \u201cno\u201d, can we in fact hold that all\nlogically exclusive possibilities must be untrue without denying that\none of the possible outcomes must turn out to be the chosen\n one?[1]\n\nIn point of fact, \u201cfuture contingents\u201d could also refer to\nfuture contingent objects. A statement like \u201cThe first astronaut\nto go to Mars will have a unique experience\u201d could be analyzed\nas referring to an object not yet existing, supposing that one day in\nthe distant future some person will indeed travel to Mars, but that\nperson has not yet been born. The notion of \u2018future contingent\nobjects\u2019 involves important philosophical questions, for\ninstance the issue of ethical obligations towards future generations,\nquantification over \u201cfuture contingent objects\u201d etc.\nHowever, this entry is confined to the study of future contingent\nstatements.\n\nThe problem of future contingents is interwoven with a number of\nissues in theology, philosophy, logic, semantics of natural language,\ncomputer science, and applied mathematics. The theological issue of\nhow to reconcile the assumption of God\u2019s foreknowledge with the\nfreedom and moral accountability of human beings has been a main\nimpetus to the discussion and a major inspiration to the development\nof various logical models of time and future contingents. This\ntheological issue is connected with the general philosophical question\nof determinism versus indeterminism. Within logic, the relation\nbetween time and modality must be studied and various models\nsatisfying various assumptions with respect to the structure of time\nmust be developed and investigated. The project of formal semantics\nfor natural languages also has to address the problem of how to\nascribe a correct semantics to statements about the future. Finally,\nit should be mentioned that temporal logic has found a remarkable\napplication in computer science and applied mathematics (see Hasle and\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 2004).\n\nIn the present context the issue of future contingents will be\napproached from the viewpoint of philosophical logic with due\nconsideration to philosophical-theological origins.\n",
