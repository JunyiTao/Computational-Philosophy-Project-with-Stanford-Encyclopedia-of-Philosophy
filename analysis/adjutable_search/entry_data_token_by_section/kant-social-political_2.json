    "main_text": "Social Contract\n3. Social Contract\n\nKant provides two distinct discussions of social contract. One\nconcerns property and will be treated in more detail in section 5\nbelow. The second discussion of social contract comes in the essay\n\u201cTheory and Practice\u201d in the context of an a priori\nrestriction on the legitimate policies the sovereign may pursue. There\nis also a briefer statement in the Doctrine of Right\n(6:315\u201316). The sovereign must recognize the \u201coriginal\ncontract\u201d as an idea of reason that forces the sovereign to\n\u201cgive his laws in such a way that they could have arisen from\nthe united will of a whole people and to regard each subject, insofar\nas he wants to be a citizen, as if he has joined in voting for such a\nwill\u201d (8:297). This original contract, Kant stresses, is not a\nhistorical event but only an idea of reason, that is, is a concept\ngenerated by reason itself with no possible empirical reference that\nis used by reason to guide empirical thought or action. Any rights and\nduties stemming from an original contract do so not because of any\nparticular historical provenance, but because of the rightful\nrelations embodied in the original contract. No empirical act, as a\nhistorical act would be, could be the foundation of any rightful\nduties or rights. The idea of an original contract limits the\nsovereign as legislator. No law may be promulgated that \u201ca whole\npeople could not possibly give its consent to\u201d (8:297). The\nconsent at issue, however, is also not an empirical consent based upon\nany actual act. The set of actual particular desires of citizens is\nnot the basis of determining whether they could possibly consent to a\nlaw. Rather, the kind of possibility at issue appears to be one of\nrational possible unanimity based upon fair distributions of burdens\nand rights in abstraction from empirical facts or desires.\nKant\u2019s two examples both exemplify this consideration of\npossible rational unanimity. His first example is a law that would\nprovide hereditary privileges to members of a certain class of\nsubjects. This law would be unjust because it would be irrational for\nthose who would not be members of this class to agree to accept fewer\nprivileges than members of the class. One might say that no possible\nempirical information could cause all individuals to agree to this\nlaw. Kant\u2019s second example concerns a war tax. If the tax is\nadministered fairly, it would not be unjust. Kant adds that even if\nthe actual citizens opposed the war, the war tax would be just because\nit is possible that the war is being waged for legitimate reasons that\nthe state but not the citizens know about. Here possible empirical\ninformation might cause all citizens to approve the law. In both these\nexamples, the conception of \u201cpossible consent\u201d abstracts\nfrom actual desires individual citizens have. The possible consent is\nnot based upon a hypothetical vote given actual preferences but is\nbased on a rational conception of agreement given any possible\nempirical information.\n\nKant\u2019s view is similar to the social contract theory of Hobbes\nin a few important respects. The social contract is not a historical\ndocument and does not involve a historical act. In fact it can be\ndangerous to the stability of the state to even search history for\nsuch empirical justification of state power (6:318). The current state\nmust be understood, regardless of its origin, to embody the social\ncontact. The social contract is a rational justification for state\npower, not a result of actual deal-making among individuals or between\nthem and a government. The social contract is not voluntary; rather,\nindividuals may be forced into the civil condition against their\nconsent (6:256). Social contract is not based on any actual consent\nsuch as a voluntary choice to form a civil society along with others.\nSince the social contract reflects reason, each human being as a\nrational being already contains the basis for rational agreement to\nthe state. Are individuals then coerced to recognize their subjection\nto state power against their will? Since Kant defines\n\u201cwill\u201d as \u201cpractical reason itself\u201d\n(Groundwork, 4:412), the answer for him is \u201cno.\u201d\nIf one defines \u201cwill\u201d as arbitrary choice, then the answer\nis \u201cyes.\u201d Kant holds that individuals can be coerced to\nleave the state of nature and enter a civil condition (6:307), but\nsince the state of nature, like the social contract, is merely an idea\nof reason, this authorization for coercion means that now individuals\nare rightfully subject to the coercive power of the state regardless\nof any explicit consent on their part. This dichotomy between\nagreement based on one\u2019s empirical will and agreement based on one\u2019s\npure practical reason also arises with regard to Kant\u2019s theory\nof punishment (section 7). A substantial difference between Kant on\nthe one hand and Hobbes and Locke on the other hand is that the latter\nbase their arguments on the individual benefit for each party to the\ncontract, whereas Kant bases his argument on Right itself, understood\nas freedom for all persons in general, not just for the individual\nbenefit that the parties to the contract obtain in their own\nparticular freedom. To this extent Kant is influenced more by\nRousseau\u2019s idea of the General Will.\n",
