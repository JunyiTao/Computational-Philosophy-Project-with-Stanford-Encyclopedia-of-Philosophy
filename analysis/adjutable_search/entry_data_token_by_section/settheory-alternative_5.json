    "main_text": "Typed Theories\n3. Typed Theories\n\nAn early response to the paradoxes of set theory (by Russell, who\ndiscovered one of them) was the development of type theory (see the\nappendix to Russell\u2019s The Principles of Mathematics\n(1903) or Whitehead & Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (1910\u20131913).\n\nThe simplest theory of this kind, which we call TST (Th\u00e9orie\nSimple des Types, from the French, following Forster and others) is\nobtained as follows. We admit sorts of object indexed by the natural\nnumbers (this is purely a typographical convenience; no actual\nreference to natural numbers is involved). Type 0 is inhabited by\n\u201cindividuals\u201d with no specified structure. Type 1 is\ninhabited by sets of type 0 objects, and in general type \\(n + 1\\) is\ninhabited by sets of type \\(n\\) objects.\n\nThe type system is enforced by the grammar of the language. Atomic\nsentences are equations or membership statements, and they are only\nwell-formed if they take one of the forms \\(x^{n} = y^{n}\\) or \\(x^{n}\n\\in y^{n+1}\\).\n\nThe axioms of extensionality of TST take the form\n\n\\[ A^{n+1} = B^{n+1} \\leftrightarrow \\forall x^n (x^n \\in A^{n+1} \\leftrightarrow x^n \\in B^{n+1}); \\]\n\n\nthere is a separate axiom for each \\(n\\).\n\nThe axioms of comprehension of TST take the form (for any\nchoice of a type \\(n\\), a formula \\(\\phi\\), and a variable \\(A^{n+1}\\)\nnot free in \\(\\phi)\\) \n\n\\[ \\exists A^{n+1}\\forall x^n (x^n \\in A^{n+1} \\leftrightarrow \\phi) \\]\n\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the axioms of TST are\nprecisely analogous to those of naive set theory.\n\nThis is not the original type theory of Russell. Leaving aside\nRussell\u2019s use of \u201cpropositional functions\u201d instead\nof classes and relations, the system of Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead & Russell 1910\u20131913), hereinafter PM\nfails to be a set theory because it has separate types for relations\n(propositional functions of arity \\(\\gt 1)\\). It was not until Norbert\nWiener observed in 1914 that it was possible to define the ordered\npair as a set (his definition of \\(\\lt x, y \\gt\\) was not the current\n\\(\\{\\{x\\},\\{x, y\\}\\}\\), due to Kuratowski (1921), but \\(\\{\\{\\{x\\},\n\\varnothing \\},\\{\\{y\\}\\}\\})\\) that it became clear that it is possible\nto code relation types into set types. Russell frequently said in\nEnglish that relations could be understood as sets of pairs (or longer\ntuples) but he had no implementation of this idea (in fact, he defined\nordered pairs as relations in PM rather than the now usual\nreverse!) For a discussion of the history of this simplified type\ntheory, see Wang 1970.\n\nFurther, Russell was worried about circularity in definitions of sets\n(which he believed to be the cause of the paradoxes) to the extent\nthat he did not permit a set of a given type to be defined by a\ncondition which involved quantification over the same type or a higher\ntype. This predicativity restriction weakens the mathematical\npower of set theory to an extreme degree.\n\nIn Russell\u2019s system, the restriction is implemented by\ncharacterizing a type not only by the type of its elements but by an\nadditional integer parameter called its \u201corder\u201d. For any\nobject with elements, the order of its type is higher than the order\nof the type of its elements. Further, the comprehension axiom is\nrestricted so that the condition defining a set of a type of order\n\\(n\\) can contain parameters only of types with order \\(\\le n\\) and\nquantifiers only over types with order \\(\\lt n\\). Russell\u2019s\nsystem is further complicated by the fact that it is not a theory of\nsets, as we noted above, because it also contains relation types (this\nmakes a full account of it here inappropriate). Even if we restrict to\ntypes of sets, a simple linear hierarchy of types is not possible if\ntypes have order, because each type has \u201cpower set\u201d types\nof each order higher than its own.\n\nWe present a typed theory of sets with predicativity restrictions (we\nhave seen this in work of Marcel Crabb\u00e9, but it may be older).\nIn this system, the types do not have orders, but Russell\u2019s\nramified type theory with orders (complete with relation types) can be\ninterpreted in it (a technical result of which we do not give an\naccount here).\n\nThe syntax of predicative TST is the same as that of the\noriginal system. The axioms of extensionality are also the same. The\naxioms of comprehension of predicative TST take the form (for\nany choice of a type \\(n\\), a formula \\(\\phi\\), and a variable\n\\(A^{n+1}\\) not free in \\(\\phi\\), satisfying the restriction that no\nparameter of type \\(n + 2\\) or greater appears in \\(\\phi\\), nor does\nany quantifier over type \\(n + 1\\) or higher appear in \\(\\phi)\\)\n\n\\[ \\exists A^{n+1}\\forall x^n (x^n \\in A^{n+1} \\leftrightarrow \\phi) \\]\n\n\nPredicative mathematics does not permit unrestricted mathematical\ninduction: In impredicative type theory, we can define 0 and the\n\u201csuccessor\u201d \\(A^+\\) of a set just as we did above in naive\nset theory (in a given type \\(n)\\) then define the set of natural\nnumbers: \n\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbf{N}^{n+1} = \\{m^n \\mid\\forall A^{n+1}[[0^n\n\\in A^{n+1} \\amp \\forall B^n (B^n \\in A^{n+1} \\rightarrow (B^+)^n \\in\nA^{n+1})] \\\\ \\rightarrow m^n \\in A^{n+1}] \\} \\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\nRussell would object that the set \\(\\mathbf{N}^{n+1}\\) is being\n\u201cdefined\u201d in terms of facts about all sets\n\\(A^{n+1}\\): something is a type \\(n + 1\\) natural number just in case\nit belongs to all type \\(n + 1\\) inductive sets. But one of the type\n\\(n + 1\\) sets in terms of which it is being \u201cdefined\u201d is\n\\(\\mathbf{N}^{n+1}\\) itself. (Independently of predicativist scruples,\none does need an Axiom of Infinity to ensure that all natural numbers\nexist; this is frequently added to TST, as is the Axiom of\nChoice).\n\nFor similar reasons, predicative mathematics does not permit the Least\nUpper Bound Axiom of analysis (the proof of this axiom in a set\ntheoretical implementation of the reals as Dedekind cuts fails for the\nsame kind of reason).\n\nRussell solved these problems in PM by adopting an Axiom of\nReducibility which in effect eliminated the predicativity\nrestrictions, but in later comments on PM he advocated\nabandoning this axiom.\n\nMost mathematicians are not predicativists; in our opinion the best\nanswer to predicativist objections is to deny that comprehension\naxioms can properly be construed as definitions (though we admit that\nwe seem to find ourselves frequently speaking loosely of \\(\\phi\\) as\nthe condition which \u201cdefines\u201d \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\})\\).\n\nIt should be noted that it is possible to do a significant amount of\nmathematics while obeying predicativist scruples. The set of natural\nnumbers cannot be defined in the predicative version of TST,\nbut the set of singletons of natural numbers can be defined and can be\nused to prove some instances of induction (enough to do quite a bit of\nelementary mathematics). Similarly, a version of the Dedekind\nconstruction of the real numbers can be carried out, in which many\nimportant instances of the least upper bound axiom will be\nprovable.\n\nType theories are still in use, mostly in theoretical computer\nscience, but these are type theories of functions, with\ncomplexity similar to or greater than the complexity of the system of\nPM, and fortunately outside the scope of this study.\n",
