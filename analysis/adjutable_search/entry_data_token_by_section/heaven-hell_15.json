    "main_text": "Heaven: Three Critical Issues || Concerning the Misery of Loved Ones in Hell\n5.3 Concerning the Supposed Tedium of Immortality\n\nA third issue concerning heaven that sometimes arises is whether\neverlasting bliss is even a possible state of affairs. Bernard\nWilliams has thus suggested \u201cthat immortality would be, where\nconceivable at all, intolerable\u201d (in Fischer 1993, 73).\nCommenting on a play by Karel Capek about a women who at age 42\nreceives immortality and by age 342 no longer wants to live, Williams\nwrote: \u201cHer trouble was, it seems, boredom: a boredom connected\nwith the fact that everything that could happen and make sense to one\nhuman being of 42 had already happened to her\u201d by age 342\n(82).\n\nSuch a statement is reminiscent of a quotation often attributed to\nCharles H. Duell, who became commissioner of the U.S. patent office in\n1898. According to legend, Duell declared that everything that can be\ninvented has already been invented; and even though this wonderful\nstory is probably apocryphal, it nonetheless illustrates in a humorous\nway the possible consequences of an impoverished imagination. It would\nhardly take even 30 years, depending upon the circumstances, for a\ngiven life to become dull and insipid. But the idea that a healthy\nperson could exhaust all the possibilities for adventure and\nmeaningful experience in a mere 300 years will strike many as simply\npreposterous. A mere 300 years is virtually nothing, it is true, when\ncompared to a life without end. So the real issue is whether it is\nlogically possible that an unending life (in which one retains\none\u2019s identity as the same person) should be filled with\nunending joy and ever increasing opportunities for novel and\nmeaningful experiences.\n\nAddressing this very issue, John Martin Fischer writes:\n\u201cRemember [the possibility] that certain \u2026 of one\u2019s\nfamily and friends also have the relevant sort of immortality. It\nseems to me that under such circumstances one could live an attractive\nlife characterized by a desirable mix of fulfilling\nactivities\u201d (Fischer 1993, 10\u2014his italics). Might not an\nunending life even increase the possibilities for such a\ndesirable mix? A favorite symphony not heard for a hundred years or so\nmight be experienced as utterly fresh and exciting. And even if we set\naside anything that might raise a controversy about personal identity,\nthe mere discovery of an unexpected means of traversing our\nextravagant universe, with its billions of galaxies and billions of\nstar systems within each of them, might open up\u2014for adventurous\nspirits anyway\u2014incredible possibilities for new and exciting\nexperiences. Nor should we ignore the further possibility of\nexperiencing infinitely many other realms and universes that are not\nspatially contiguous with our own. Pursuing Fischer\u2019s idea of a\ndesirable mix even further, a longer life could also increase the\nchances for the experience of boredom itself to fit into a larger\ncontext of meaningful experience. In caring for her baby, for example,\na mother typically performs many mundane tasks that might seem utterly\ntedious were it not for the joy of interacting with her baby and of\nwatching it grow and flourish. Similarly, St. Paul found even the\ntedium of prison to be tolerable, so he claimed, because he saw it as\npart of a larger story that he believed to be both true and glorious.\nSo why allow, many religious people would ask, an impoverished\nimagination to exclude the very possibility of an over-arching story\narc perpetually giving fresh meaning to our individual lives?\n\nStill, all of that having been said, Williams\u2019s view concerning\nthe inevitably tedious nature of an unending life is not that far\nremoved from the religious view that in our present unperfected\ncondition we are not yet fit for eternity and not yet capable of\nexperiencing the most worthwhile forms of happiness; indeed, given our\npresent condition, some would claim, we might even turn heaven itself\ninto a hellish experience. And if that be true, then the task of\nrendering someone fit for eternal joy may be far more complicated,\neven for an omnipotent being, than one might have imagined. As many\nreligions including Christianity teach, we must first learn to love\nproperly before we can experience enduring happiness, and this\nrequires that we also be purged of all selfish tendencies, all lust\nfor power over others, every temptation to benefit ourselves at the\nexpense of others, and anything else that might separate one person\nfrom another. Right here, of course, is where Williams would question\nwhether a suitably transformed person would be the same individual as\nthe unperfected person that existed previously. But none of our moral\nimperfections, a religious person might retort, can coherently be\nnumbered among our essential properties\u2014as if we could never\nprogress morally and never learn to become more loving persons. So\nhere, perhaps, is the sum of the matter from a religious perspective:\nthe more self-absorbed we become, the more tedious and dreary our\nlives inevitably become over time. But the more outwardly focused we\nbecome in loving relationships, the more joyful and meaningful our\nlives also become over time.\n\nIn any case, the controversies associated with Williams\u2019s\nunderstanding of immortality are also relevant to the problem of evil.\nFor the same considerations that lead some to wonder whether\nimmortality would eventually become dreadfully boring may also lead\nsome of the religious to consider favorably the following hypothesis.\nFor all we know, an environment such as the one we live in\u2014an\nenvironment in which one encounters real threats and dangers of a\ntemporary kind, where one person\u2019s temporary welfare may depend\nupon the choices of others and upon natural forces over which one has\nlimited or no control, where a quest for truth and genuine discoveries\nabout the glories of God\u2019s creation are possible, and where\nmoral failure would likely provide ample opportunities for repentance,\nforgiveness, and atonement\u2014for all we know, such an environment\nis an important part of the process whereby God renders us fit for\neternal joy. Although the problem of evil is the subject of another\nentry (see the entry on\n The Problem of Evil),\n the relevant point for the topic of heaven is just this: one need not\nthink of heaven (or the coming age, as the Gospel writers sometimes\nrefer to it) as a static ethereal realm in which there is nothing to\ndo. One might instead suppose that God will never stop creating\nadditional persons to love and additional realms for us to experience\nand that we will always have important roles to play, as Paul hinted\nin Ephesians 2:7, in this ongoing process of creation and\nrevelation.\n",
