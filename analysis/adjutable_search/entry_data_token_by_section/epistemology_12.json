Whether a\nbelief is justified or unjustified, there is something that\nmakes it so. Let\u2019s call the things that make a belief\njustified or unjustified J-factors. Which features of a belief are\nJ-factors?\n\nAccording to \u201cevidentialists\u201d, it is the believer\u2019s\npossession of evidence for p. What is it, though, to possess\nevidence for p? Some evidentialists (though not all) would say\nit is to be in an experience that presents p as being true.\nAccording to these evidentialists, if the coffee in your cup tastes\nsweet to you, then you have evidence that the coffee is sweet. If you\nfeel a throbbing pain in your head, you have evidence that you have a\nheadache. If you have a memory of having had cereal for breakfast,\nthen you have evidence about what you had for breakfast. And when you\nclearly \u201csee\u201d or \u201cintuit\u201d that the proposition\n\u201cIf Jack had more than four cups of coffee, then Jack had more\nthan three cups of coffee\u201d is true, then you have evidence for\nthat proposition. On this view, evidence consists of perceptual,\nintrospective, memorial, and intuitional experiences, and to possess\nevidence is to have an experience of that kind. So according to this\n\u201cexperientialist\u201d version of evidentialism, what makes you\njustified in believing that p is your having an experience that\nrepresents p as being true (see Conee and Feldman 2008 and\nMcCain 2014 for defenses of such a view). Other versions of\nevidentialism might identify other factors as your evidence, but would\nstill insist that those factors are the J-factors.\n\nEvidentialism is often contrasted with reliabilism, which is the view\nthat a belief is justified by resulting from a reliable source, where\na source is reliable just in case it tends to result in mostly true\nbeliefs. Reliabilists, of course, can also grant that the experiences\nmentioned in the previous paragraph can matter to the justification of\nyour beliefs. However, they deny that justification is\nessentially a matter of having suitable experiences. Rather,\nthey say, those experiences matter to the justification of your\nbeliefs not merely by virtue of being evidence in support of those\nbeliefs, but more fundamentally, by virtue of being part of the\nreliable source of those beliefs. Different versions of reliabilism\nhave been defended: some philosophers claim that what justifies a\nbelief is that it is produced by a process that is reliable (for\ninstance, see Goldman 1986), others claim that what justifies a belief\nis that it is responsive to grounds that reliably covary with the\ntruth of that belief, other claim that what justifies a belief is that\nit is formed by the virtuous exercise of a capacity, and so on.\n",
