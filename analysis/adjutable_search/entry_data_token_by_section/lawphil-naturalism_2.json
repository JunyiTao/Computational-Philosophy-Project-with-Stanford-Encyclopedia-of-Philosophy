Replacement Naturalism II: American Legal Realism\n\nThe locus classicus of the second kind of Replacement\nNaturalism\u2014the one deriving from an attack on\nfoundationalism\u2014is Quine\u2019s \u201cEpistemology\nNaturalized\u201d (1969). The central enterprise of epistemology\non Quine\u2019s view is to understand the relation between our\ntheories of the world and the evidence (sensory input) on which they\nare based. Quine\u2019s target is one influential construal of this\nproject: Cartesian foundationalism, particularly in the sophisticated\nform given to it in the twentieth century by Rudolf Carnap in Der\nLogische Aufbau der Welt (1928). The foundationalist wants an\naccount of the theory-evidence relation that would vindicate the\nprivileged epistemic status of at least some subset of our theories:\nour theories (in particular, our best theories of natural science) are\nto be \u201cgrounded\u201d in indubitable evidence (i.e., immediate\nsense impressions). Quine deems foundationalism a failure: the\nsemantic part of the program is rendered unrealizable by meaning\nholism (theoretical terms get their meanings from their place in\nthe whole theoretical framework, not in virtue of some point-by-point\ncontact with sensory input), while the epistemic part of the program\nis defeated by the Duhem\u2013Quine thesis about the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence (there is always more than\none theory consistent with the evidence, in part because a\ntheoretical hypothesis can always be preserved in the face of\nrecalcitrant evidence by abandoning the auxiliary hypotheses that\ninformed the test of the hypothesis) (see Kim 1988, pp.\n385\u2013386).\n\nWhat becomes, then, of epistemology? Hilary Kornblith has summed up\nQuine\u2019s view as follows: \u201cOnce we see the sterility of the\nfoundationalist program, we see that the only genuine questions there\nare to ask about the relation between theory and evidence and about\nthe acquisition of belief are psychological questions\u201d\n(Kornblith 1994, p. 4). Kornblith aptly dubs this view Quine\u2019s\n\u201creplacement thesis\u201d: \u201cthe view that epistemological\nquestions may be replaced by psychological questions\u201d (Kornblith\n1994, p. 3). Here is how Quine puts it:\n\nThe stimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody\nhas had to go on, ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the world.\nWhy not just see how this construction really proceeds? Why not settle\nfor psychology? Such a surrender of the epistemological burden to\npsychology is a move that was disallowed in earlier time as circular\nreasoning. If the epistemologist\u2019s goal is validation of the\ngrounds of empirical science, he defeats his purpose by using\npsychology or other empirical science in the validation. However, such\nscruples against circularity have little point once we have stopped\ndreaming of deducing science from observations. (1969, pp.\n75\u201376)\n\n\nSeveral pages later, Quine continues that on his proposal,\n\nEpistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a\nchapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a\nnatural phenomenon, viz., a physical subject. This human subject is\naccorded a certain experientially controlled input\u2014certain\npatterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for\ninstance\u2014and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as\noutput a description of the three-dimensional external world and its\nhistory. The relation between the meager input and the torrential\noutput is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the\nsame reasons that always prompted epistemology; namely, in order to\nsee how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one\u2019s\ntheory of nature transcends any available evidence. (1969, pp.\n82\u201383)\n\n\nThus, according to Quine, the central concern of epistemology is\nthe theory-evidence relationship; if the foundationalist story about\nthis relationship is a failure, then that leaves only one story worth\ntelling about this relationship: namely, the story told by \u201ca\npurely descriptive, causal-nomological science of human\ncognition\u201d (Kim 1988, p. 388). The science of human cognition\nreplaces armchair epistemology: we naturalize epistemology by\nturning over its central question\u2014the relationship between\ntheory and evidence\u2014to the relevant empirical science.\n\nWe can now generalize Quine\u2019s point as follows (Leiter 1998).\nLet us say that a Replacement Naturalist in any branch of philosophy\nholds that:\n\nFor any pair of relata that might stand in a justificatory\nrelation\u2014e.g., evidence and theory, reasons and belief, causal\nhistory and semantic or intentional content, legal reasons and\njudicial decision\u2014if no normative account of the relation is\npossible, then the only theoretically fruitful account is the\ndescriptive/explanatory account given by the relevant science of that\ndomain.\n\n\nThis goes beyond Quine in one important respect: for Quine infers\nReplacement Naturalism only from the failure of\nfoundationalism\u2014which is simply one possible normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship, but not the only one.\nQuine\u2019s arguments simply do not show that no other normative\naccount of the evidence-theory relationship is possible.\n\nQuine has been extensively criticized on precisely this score (e.g.,\nGoldman 1986, pp. 2\u20133; Kim 1988). The key to a successful\ndefense of Replacement Naturalism lies in an explanation of why\nnormative theory without foundationalism is sterile. One\nworry is that without foundationalism, normative theories are\nbanal. Consider: it is now a familiar result of cognitive\npsychology that human beings regularly make mistakes in logical\nreasoning (cf. Stich 1994). So a mere descriptive theory of\nbelief-formation, of the sort Quine appears to recommend, would simply\nrecord these mistakes. But shouldn\u2019t epistemology tell us that\nbeliefs ought not to be formed illogically? One can hardly\nimagine why Quine would disagree: one ought not to form\nbeliefs illogically. But the question is whether this piece of banal\nadvice adds up to a fruitful research program. The descriptive project\nof Replacement Naturalism may record certain irrational cognitive\nprocesses in studying the evidence-theory relationship, but given the\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, even when we correct for\nlogical mistakes, we still won\u2019t have an account of which of our\ntheoretical beliefs are warranted and which are not. The Quinean\nintuition is that we\u2019ll learn more from the empirical inquiry\nthan from systematizing our banal normative intuitions about\nirrationality. More generally, unless we have some\nfoundational point outside our epistemic practices from which to\nassess the epistemic issues, the project of systematizing our mundane\nnormative intuitions will simply collapse into the descriptive\nsociology of knowledge. If we can\u2019t stand outside the\nepistemological boat, then we can do no more than report what it is we\ndo. But it is precisely the viability of such an external standpoint\nthat Quine denies in his embrace of the metaphor of Neurath\u2019s\nboat. So from within the boat, there is nothing to do but\ndescription.\n\nQuine\u2019s argument for Replacement Naturalism, recall, moved in\ntwo steps. Step one was anti-foundationalism: no unique\ntheory is justified on the basis of the evidential input. Step two was\nreplacement: since no foundational story can be told about\nthe relation between input (evidence) and output (theory), we should\nreplace the normative program with a purely descriptive inquiry, e.g.\nthe psychological study of what input causes what output. We can find\nanalogues of both steps in the approach to the theory of adjudication\noffered by American Legal Realism.\n\nTheory of adjudication is concerned not with the relationship\nbetween \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cscientific theory,\u201d\nbut rather with the justificatory relationship between \u201clegal\nreasons\u201d (the input, as it were) and judicial decision (the\noutput): theory of adjudication tries to tell judges how they\nought to justify their decisions, i.e., it seeks to\n\u201cground\u201d judicial decision-making in reasons that require\nunique outcomes. The American Legal Realists are\n\u201canti-foundationalists\u201d about judicial decisions in the\nsense that they deny that the legal reasons justify a unique decision:\nthe legal reasons underdetermine the decision, at least in most cases\nactually litigated. More precisely, the Realists claim that the law is\nrationally indeterminate in the sense that the class of legal\nreasons\u2014i.e., the class of legitimate reasons a judge may offer\nfor a decision\u2014does not provide a justification for a\nunique outcome. Just as sensory input does not justify a\nunique scientific theory, so legal reasons, according to the Realists,\ndo not justify a unique decision.\n\nThe Realists also take the second step that Quine takes: replacement.\nAccording to the Realist indeterminacy thesis, legal reasons do not\njustify a unique decision, meaning that the foundationalist enterprise\nof theory of adjudication is impossible. Why not replace, then, the\n\u201csterile\u201d foundational program of justifying some unique\nlegal outcome on the basis of the applicable legal reasons with a\ndescriptive/explanatory account of what input (i.e., what combination\nof facts and reasons) produces what output (i.e., what judicial\ndecision)? As Underhill Moore puts it at the beginning of one of his\narticles: \u201cThis study lies within the province of jurisprudence.\nIt also lies within the field of behavioristic psychology. It places\nthe province within the field\u201d (Moore & Callahan 1943, p.\n1). Notice how closely this echoes Quine\u2019s idea that,\n\u201cEpistemology\u2026simply falls into place as a chapter of\npsychology\u2026\u201d (1969, p. 82). Jurisprudence\u2014or, more\nprecisely, the theory of adjudication\u2014is\n\u201cnaturalized\u201d because it falls into place, for the\nRealist, as a chapter of psychology (or economics or sociology, etc.).\nMoreover, it does so for essentially Quinean reasons: because the\nfoundational account of adjudication is a failure\u2014a consequence\nof accepting the Realists\u2019 famous claim that the law is\nindeterminate.\n\nOf course, this argument for Replacement Naturalism only seems to work\nagainst \u201cformalist\u201d theories of adjudication that are\ncommitted to the rational determinacy of law. But, some object,\n\u201cNo contemporary analytic jurisprudent is a formalist\u201d\n(Coleman 1998, p. 284), and some have even claimed that the\n\u201cformalists\u201d the Legal Realists opposed were not committed\nto the rational determinacy of law (Paulson 2001, p. 78). Both\nobjections seem mistaken: Ronald Dworkin, for example, is committed to\nthe rational determinacy of law in exactly the sense at issue for the\nReplacement argument. The targets of the Legal Realist critique were,\nequally, committed to the rational determinacy of law (Etchemendy\n2021); indeed, it would be impossible to make sense of what the\nRealists were doing if that were not so. The Replacement Naturalist\nmight take the view that there is no reason to call for\n\u201cnaturalizing\u201d theory of adjudication in the range of\ncases where legal reasons are satisfactory predictors of\nlegal outcomes (i.e., precisely those cases where the foundationalist\nprogram can be carried out). One may worry, again, about whether there\nis an interesting or fruitful normative story to be\ntold (rather than a merely banal descriptive sociology), but it\nsuffices for the analogy with Quine that there remains some\nsubstantial domain of cases where the foundationalist program cannot\nbe carried out, so that the case for replacement remains intact.\n\nThe real difficulty, of course, pertains not to these historical\npoints, but to whether or not the project of a normative theory of\nadjudication warrants replacement just because rational determinacy\ndoes not obtain. As in the Quinean case, the Replacement Naturalist\nmust maintain that without rational determinacy, normative theories of\nadjudication are banal, mere exercises in descriptive sociology.\nCritics of Replacement Naturalism contest this conclusion, though more\nby way of affirmation than argument (Coleman 1998, p. 285 n. 44).\nHowever, if the objection under consideration were correct, then a\nnormative theory that specifies what the anti-foundationalist\nconcedes\u2014namely, that there is more than one (though not simply\nany) judicial decision that can be justified on the basis of the class\nof legal reasons\u2014must, in some measure, be a theory worth\nhaving. Arguably, such a theory might be adequate to deflect the\nchallenge to the political legitimacy of adjudication based\non the indeterminacy of law, but does it provide the\nnormative guidance to judges we want from a theory? Does a\ntheory that tells judges they would be justified (on the basis of the\nclass of legal reasons) in deciding for the plaintiff on theory\nX or the defendant on theory Y (but not the\nplaintiff or defendant on theory Z!) really provide normative guidance\nfor judges worth having? The Replacement Naturalist answers in the\nnegative: better to have a descriptive account of inputs and outputs,\none that would license prediction of judicial behavior, than an\nindeterminate normative theory. This response, of course, makes\nReplacement Naturalism vulnerable to conflicting intuitions about the\nfruitfulness or sterility of different kinds of theorizing.\n\nThere are other limits to the Quinean analogy (Leiter 2001a, pp.\n284\u2013285; Greenberg 2011 disputes other aspects of the analogy,\nwhile Leiter 2011 replies to some of Greenberg\u2019s objections).\nFirst, the American Legal Realists end up presupposing a theory of the\nconcept of legality in framing their arguments for law\u2019s\nindeterminacy (Leiter 2001a, pp. 292\u2013293); thus, while they may\nbelieve that the only fruitful account of adjudication is\ndescriptive and empirical, not normative and conceptual, they\nthemselves need a concept of law that is not\u2014at least\non the arguments considered so far\u2014empirical or naturalized. As\none critic of Replacement Naturalism notes: \u201cthe naturalist is\ncommitted as a conceptual matter to the existence of a test of\nlegality\u2026. The naturalist is thus in the same boat with every\nother analytic philosopher of law\u201d (Coleman 2001, p. 214). The\nanalogy with naturalized epistemology, in other words, must be\nlocalized to the theory of adjudication, and not the whole of\njurisprudence. Of course, it remains possible for the Replacement\nNaturalist to argue for the requisite concept of legality on precisely\nthe empirical grounds noted in the previous section\n(\u201cReplacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis\u201d).\nBut as it stands, the analogy to Quine\u2019s attack on\nfoundationalist epistemology warrants no radical abandonment of\ntraditional conceptual analysis across the board.\n\nA second difference from Quine is also important. The crux of the\nLegal Realist position (at least for the majority of Realists) is that\nnon-legal reasons (e.g., judgments of fairness, or consideration of\ncommercial norms) explain the decisions. They, of course,\nexplain the decisions by justifying them, though not\nnecessarily by justifying a unique outcome (i.e., the non-legal\nreasons might themselves rationalize other decisions as well). Now\nclearly the descriptive story about the non-legal reasons is not going\nto be part of a non-mentalistic naturalization of the theory of\nadjudication: a causal explanation of decisions in terms of reasons\n(even non-legal reasons) does require taking the normative force of\nthe reasons qua reasons seriously. The behaviorism of Quine\nor Underhill Moore is not in the offing here, but surely this is to be\npreferred: behaviorism failed as a foundation for empirical social\nscience, while social-scientific theories employing mentalistic\ncategories have flourished. Moreover, if the non-legal reasons are\nthemselves indeterminate\u2014i.e., if they do not justify a\nunique outcome\u2014then any causal explanation of the\ndecision will have to go beyond reasons to identify the psycho-social\nfacts (e.g., about personality, class, gender, socialization, etc.)\nthat cause the decision. Such a \u201cnaturalization\u201d of the\ntheory of adjudication might be insufficiently austere in its ontology\nfor Quinean scruples, but it is still a recognizable attempt to\nsubsume what judges do within a (social) scientific framework.\n",
