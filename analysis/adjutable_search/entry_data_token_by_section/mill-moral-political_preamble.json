    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) was the most famous and influential\nBritish philosopher of the nineteenth century. He was one of the last\nsystematic philosophers, making significant contributions in logic,\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and social\ntheory. He was also an important public figure, articulating the\nliberal platform, pressing for various liberal reforms, and serving in\nParliament. During Mill\u2019s lifetime, he was most widely admired\nfor his work in theoretical philosophy and political economy. However,\nnowadays Mill\u2019s greatest philosophical influence is in moral and\npolitical philosophy, especially his articulation and defense of\nutilitarianism and liberalism (Nicholson 1998). This entry will\nexamine Mill\u2019s contributions to the utilitarian and liberal\ntraditions. We will concentrate on his two most popular and best known\nworks, Utilitarianism (1861, cited as U) and On\nLiberty (1859, cited as OL), drawing on other texts when\nthis sheds light on his utilitarian and liberal principles. We will\nconclude by looking at how Mill applies these principles to issues of\npolitical and sexual equality in Considerations on Representative\nGovernment (1859, cited as CRG), Principles of\nPolitical Economy (1848, cited as PPE), and The\nSubjection of Women (1869, cited as SW).\n",
