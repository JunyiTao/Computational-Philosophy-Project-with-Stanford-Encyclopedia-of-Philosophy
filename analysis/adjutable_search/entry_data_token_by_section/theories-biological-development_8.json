    "main_text": "Regulative Theories of Development || Organicism, gradients, and fields\n8.1 Organicism, gradients, and fields\n\nDriesch\u2019s experiments (see\n Section 7)\n demonstrated regulative development: the developing embryo\ncompensated for experimental intervention rather than following a\npre-determined plan. To account for this phenomenon without resorting\nto vitalism, a new theoretical approach was needed. One such was\norganicism, which Donna Haraway (1976) casts as a new Kuhnian paradigm\nfor embryology in the first half of the twentieth century. Its tenets\nincluded:\n\nthe organism is a unified whole, with multiple connections between\nlevels of complexity/organization;\ndevelopment is a goal-directed process, regulated throughout\nrather than pre-determined; and\norganismal shape and structure should be understood in terms of\nprinciples for achieving form.\n\n\nLenoir (1982) traces these ideas to Kant\u2019s Critique of\nJudgment, notably reciprocal determination of parts and the whole\norganism during the process of development. A more explicit influence\nwas von Bertalanffy\u2019s systems theory of development (1928 [1933,\ntrans. Woodger]; see the entries on\n levels of organization in biology and\n systems and synthetic biology). Another influence was D\u2019Arcy\nThompson\u2019s seminal On Growth and Form (1917; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n A key idea was that organismal form emerges from a self-organizing\nsystem, not the unfolding of a pre-existing program.\n\nHaraway (1976) identifies four main elements of organicism:\n\nthe goal of explaining organismal form;\nconcepts of symmetry, polarity, and pattern;\nfield-particle duality (analogous to physics); and\nlinks to structuralism in philosophy (i.e., a structure as a\nself-regulating, complex system involving multiple interacting levels\nof organization and spatio-temporal scales).\n\n\nShe examines these elements in the work of the paradigm\u2019s\nprincipal architects in twentieth-century developmental biology: Ross\nHarrison, Joseph Needham, and Paul Weiss. Organicists sought\nmathematical yet autonomously biological laws to account for emergent\norder in developmental processes. Although such laws did not\nmaterialize, Haraway argues that metaphors (principally those of\ncrystals and fields) played significant theoretical roles in their\nstead. More abstract theoretical concepts\u2014of polarity,\ngradients, and fields\u2014were also used to explain organismal form\nin the first half of the twentieth century. For example, Hans Spemann\n(1936 [1938]) proposed that\n\n\nthe body of many, if not all animals, at least in the embryonic state,\npossesses one or several axes with unequal poles along which there\nexists a gradient of some sort. The course of development depends upon\nthese gradients to a high degree. (1936 [1938: 318]).\n\n\nSimilarly, Charles Manning Child hypothesized that organismal\ndevelopment is based on \u201cactivity gradients\u201d grounded in\nmetabolism. Others objected that these concepts are unclear,\nmetaphysically murky, and unscientifically vitalist (see Gilbert,\nOpitz, & Raff 1996).\n\nAn important spur to gradient and field theories was the phenomenon of\n\u201cthe organizer\u201d, demonstrated by Hilde Mangold\u2019s\nexperiments transplanting newt tissue. She moved a small piece from\nthe dorsal lip of a developing Triton cristatus embryo into\nthe early gastrula of another newt species (Triton\ntaeniatus). Donor tissue thus came in contact with\nundifferentiated ectoderm of another species. The result: two\nconjoined embryos with different body axes. This indicated that dorsal\nlip tissue somehow \u201corganized\u201d host cells and tissues into\nanother embryonic body. Spemann designated the dorsal lip of the\nembryo \u201cthe organization-center\u201d or\n\u201corganizer\u201d. But how did this work? The proposed answer\nsuggested that body axes result from a gradient of some chemical\nsubstance emanating from cells of the organizer. This was the\nstarting-point for \u201cfield theories\u201d; e.g.,\n\n\n\u2026the egg and early embryo consist of fields\u2014gradients or\ndifferentiation centers in which the specific properties drop off in\nintensity as the distance from the field center increases\u2026.\n(Harrison 1969: 258)\n\n\nIn discussions with other members of Cambridge\u2019s Theoretical\nBiology Club, Joseph Needham sought a theory of the chemical nature of\nthe \u201corganizer\u201d. Building on D\u2019Arcy Thompson\u2019s\ntheories of biological form and insights from biochemistry, he\nconceptualized fields as spatial regions of a developing embryo, which\ndetermine for all points within a region a specific quality,\ndirection, and intensity. The field as a whole exhibits (in)stability\nand equilibrium positions. Organismal development is thus defined\nas\n\n\na progressive restriction of potencies by determination of the parts\nto pursue fixed fates\u2026this state of affairs can best be\npictured in the manner of a series of equilibrium states. (Needham\n1936: 58)\n\n\nThe overall process is to be explained by probabilistic \u201cfield\nlaws\u201d describing a sequence of equilibrium positions for a\nfield, extending from proteins and fibers to cell shape and organismal\nmorphology. Although Needham did not flesh out his theoretical ideas\nin detail, they show clear parallels with Waddington\u2019s view of\ndevelopment, as well as recent systems approaches (see\n Section 9.1\n and\n section 10.2).\n\nWorking in the US, Paul Weiss also elaborated field and gradient\nconcepts to sketch a theory of development that anticipated key ideas\nof systems biology today (see the entry on\n systems and synthetic biology).\n His mature theory (\u201cmolecular ecology\u201d) posited an array\nof molecular species in a cell, distributed, arranged, grouped in ways\ndetermined by their sterically-mediated interactions and physical\nenvironment (1968). Steric interactions are based on molecules\u2019\nshape and charge; biochemical features such as bonding and repulsion.\nWeiss theorized that these molecular interactions are organized by\nhigher-level fields so as to produce patterns of cell differentiation,\ngrowth, and morphogenesis according to the principle of \u201cgradual\ndetermination\u201d. There is no pre-existing \u201cseat\u201d of\nembryonic organization in the egg or early embryo\u2014instead,\norganization emerges in the process itself, through a physiological\ngradient. Weiss\u2019s theory was based on extensive research on limb\nregeneration, neural development, grafting, and cell culture. A\nregenerated amphibian limb, for example, shows the correct orientation\nand organization of parts, even if derived from different cell types\nin another body part. How do the new parts acquire a \u201csense of\ndirection\u201d yielding correct morphological organization?\nWeiss\u2019s answer is that some physiological gradient in the body,\ntells the cells \u201cwhere they are and what to do\u201d.\n\nWeiss theorized this idea in terms of fields:\n\n\nfactors which cause the originally indefinite course of the individual\nparts of a germ to become definite and specific, and, furthermore,\ncause this to occur in compliance with a typical pattern. (1939:\n290)\n\n\nA field is organized from center to periphery, with a focal point of\nmaximal intensity and gradual decrease from this center. This\norganization entails a \u201cphysiological gradient\u201d: a robust\ndistribution of (molecular) properties, which vary along the three\nspatial dimensions and along one or more axes (polarity). Its causal\nactivity is holistic, determining cell behavior, which in turn\nproduces growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Haraway (1976),\nKeller (2002), and Vecchi and Hern\u00e1ndez (2014) examine the\ncomplex and uneven history of gradient and field concepts in\ndevelopmental biology. Haraway, as discussed above, is concerned\nprimarily with these concepts as metaphors structuring the organicist\nparadigm via the work of Harrison, Needham, and Weiss. Evelyn Fox\nKeller considers these concepts as part of the (so far largely\nunsuccessful) tradition of mathematicizing biology to understand\ndevelopment. Davide Vecchi and Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez elaborate on\nKeller\u2019s view, arguing that the concept of \u201cmorphogenetic\nfield\u201d was supplanted by Wolpert\u2019s concept of\n\u201cpositional information\u201d, part of the\nmid-twentieth-century theoretical shift from organicist ideas to\ngenetic control of development (see\n Section 8.3).\n",
