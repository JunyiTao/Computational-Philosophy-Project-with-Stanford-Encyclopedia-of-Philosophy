    "preamble": "\n\nIsaac Albalag stands out as one of the most rigorous representatives\nof the school of Jewish Averroism which flourished in Western Europe\nin the thirteenth century and lasted until the Renaissance. The\nmembers of this school, such as Ibn Kaspi, Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera,\nMoses Narboni, Isaac Polqar, Gersonides, and Elijah Delmedigo,\nregarded Averroes\u2019 philosophical writings, particularly his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, as the main source for the study of\nscience and philosophy. The impact of Averroes on these philosophers,\nvaried as it was, extended to the question of the relationship between\nreligion and philosophy. Many Jewish philosophers, drawing upon\nAverroes\u2019 religious epistemology, which established a\ntheoretical basis for reading Scripture and demonstrative sciences as\ndifferent representations of the truth rather than conflicting truths,\nundertook to interpret Judaism as a philosophical religion, a\nphilosophical-religious approach that was arguably championed by the\nprominent Jewish philosopher Maimonides (d.1204). Like most Jewish\nAverroists, Albalag occupied himself with purely philosophical\nquestions of physics, metaphysics, and epistemology, addressing them\nthrough the lens of Averroes. Characteristically, Albalag holds\nunreserved admiration for and faithfulness to Aristotle whose\nteachings he deems synonymous with the truth and which he\ndiscovers in the writings of Averroes. Restoring Aristotelianism and\nestablishing it among Jewish students of philosophy emerge as key\ngoals of Albalag\u2019s philosophical enterprise. Within the\nframework of that enterprise, Albalag also engages with the crucial\nquestion of the relationship between Judaism and philosophy, uniquely\nanswering it by advocating the double truth doctrine.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nLittle is known about Isaac Albalag. All that we know about him is\nthat he lived in the second half of the thirteenth century either in\nCatalonia or Provence (Sirat 1985: 238). References to Albalag in the\nmedieval Jewish literature indicate that he was not a figure of\nfavorable reputation. His name appears in a number of Jewish writings\nusually in association with humiliating accusations of heresy. The\nKabbalist Shem Tov Ibn Shem Tov (d.1440), for instance,\naccuses Albalag of heresy for advocating a heretical view regarding\nthe fate of the human soul (Sefer ha \u02beemunot [the Book\nof Beliefs], I:1). In Sefer Neveh Shalom (Indwelling of\nPeace), the fifteenth-century Spanish thinker Abraham Shalom\nattacks Albalag for eliminating the doctrine of creation by radically\nnaturalizing the account for celestial motion (Vajda 1960: 271).\nAlbalag\u2019s worth as a philosopher did not go unnoticed,\nnotwithstanding. Isaac Polqar (14th century), the author of\n\u02bfEzer ha-dat (The Support of Faith) holds Albalag in\ngreat esteem and cites him approvingly in dealing with the\ncontroversial issue of the origin of the world (\u02bfEzer\nha-dat: part II: p.46).\n\nAlbalag wrote only one treatise, Sefer Tiqqun ha de\u02bfot\n(The Emendation of the Opinions)\u2014I here employ Manekin\u2019s\ntranslation of the title (Manekin 2007: 140)\u2014which is a\ntranslation with commentarial notes on the first two sections of Abu\nHamid al-Ghazali\u2019s encyclopedic treatise kit\u0101b\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah (The Opinions of the\nPhilosophers), Logic and Metaphysics. The third section, Natural\nPhilosophy, was completed by Isaac Polqar (Vajda 1960: 268).\n\nTwo goals stand behind the composition of the Tiqqun. The\nprimary one, as the title reveals (Emendation of the Opinions), is\ncorrective. Motivated by confidence in Aristotelianism, Albalag adopts\na critical stance towards any doctrine that deviates from Aristotelian\nteachings and rules. For him, most errors in the philosophical\ndiscourse are instances of deviation from Aristotle or\nmisunderstandings of his teachings. The cumulative literature of\ncommentaries on Aristotle, excluding Averroes\u2019 commentaries, is\nreplete with such instances. Avicenna is particularly regarded by\nAlbalag as a major source of error and thus the process of\n\u201cemendation\u201d (Tiqqun) largely consists in\nsystematic critiques of Avicennian philosophy. But Avicenna is not the\nsole target of criticism, though he is the central one. Albalag also\ncriticizes other philosophers such as al-Farabi, Maimonides, and\nal-Ghazali\u2014it is not unlikely that Albalag thought, like\nMedieval Latin philosophers, that Maq\u0101\u1e63id\nal-Fal\u0101sifah was a genuine representation of\nal-Ghazali\u2019s philosophical view (for al-Ghazali\u2019s\nphilosophical image in Latin literature see Salman 1999; Shihadeh\n2011).[1]\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah encompasses a concise\npresentation of the opinions of the philosophers, and as a result it\nfurnishes Albalag with an ideal framework for pursuing the announced\nprocess of \u201cemendation\u201d (Tiqqun). In most of his\ndiscussions, critiques, and corrections Albalag derives what he\nregards as the correct understanding of Aristotle from Averroes\u2019\nwritings. \n\nThe second goal of the Tiqqun is pedagogical. Here, again,\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63id al-Fal\u0101sifah\nserves as an adequate vehicle. Thanks to al-Ghazali\u2019s style\nwhich is free of complexities and accords with \u201cpopular\nbeliefs\u201d, the Maq\u0101\u1e63id provides a suitable\nmedium for instructing students who have little training in philosophy\n(Tiqqun preface: 4). By translating and commenting on\nal-Ghazali\u2019s Maq\u0101\u1e63id, Albalag hopes to offer\na piecemeal instruction in philosophy, starting with a presentation of\nGhazali\u2019s summary of the doctrines of the philosophers and\nculminating in the establishment of Aristotelian demonstrative\ndoctrines. Overall, the Tiqqun follows the structure of the\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id except on some occasions where Albalag\nengages in large digressions.\n2. Logic\n\nThe first part of the Tiqqun (Logic) is, more or less, a\nfaithful translation of the Maq\u0101\u1e63id. Although this\npart is generally unoriginal, it may still be credited with a specific\ncontribution. Manuscripts of the Tiqqun include a sympathetic\ndiscussion of the fourth figure of syllogism. This figure was\nattributed by most Medieval logicians to Galen, though this\nattribution remains disputed in modern scholarship (Rescher 1965;\nSabra 1965), and was dismissed as lacking utility and\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d (see Gersonides Sefer ha-heqqesh\nha-Yashar  [The Book of the Correct Syllogism]: 147). It is not\nclear, however, whether Albalag himself wrote this discussion or\nwhether it was written by Abner of Burgos, a thirteenth-century\nJewish-convert-to-Christianity philosopher, as suggested by some\ntextual evidence (Vajda 1960: 275\u2013276).  In any case, the\ninclusion of this discussion in the Tiqqun independently of\nany explicit criticism indicates that Albalag agrees with its positive\nattitude towards the fourth figure of syllogism.\n\nThe Aristotelian syllogism does not determine a specific order for the\nmajor and minor premises. Hence, the terms comprising the premises,\nthe \u201cunique major\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d terms and the\nshared middle term, may be arranged in three possible figures as\nfollows: \n\n in the first figure, the middle term is subject in one premise\nand predicate in the other, \n in the second, it is subject in both premises, and \n in the third, it is predicate in both (Manekin 1996: 50).\n\n\nSome later logicians distinguished the order of the major and minor\npremises with the result that the first figure was divided into two\nfigures: \n\nin the first, the middle term is the subject in the minor and\npredicate in the major premises, and \n in the second, it is the subject in the major and the predicate\nin the minor premises (ibid, 1996: 50). \n\n\nThe additional fourth figure \u201cis sometimes placed after the\nfirst figure, rather than the third\u201d (ibid, 1996: 50).\n\nThe Tiqqun provides a quasi-defense of the fourth figure as a\n\u201cvaluable\u201d form of reasoning (Tiqqun n.5:12).\nThis interrupts Albalag\u2019s overall adherence to Averroes who,\nlike the majority of Medieval logicians, rejects the fourth figure due\nto considerations that have to do with \u201cnaturalness.\u201d\nAccording to Averroes, \u201cthe form of reasoning embodied in the\nfourth figure of syllogism does not exist in us by nature\u201d and\ninvolves \u201cabsurd self-predication\u201d (Manekin 1996: 56). In\nHebrew logical writings, limited attempts were advanced to establish\nthe validity of that figure, most famously by Gersonides. The\ndiscussion in the Tiqqun is another attempt to this effect\nwhere the author, interestingly, subjects even Aristotle to criticism\nfor omitting this form of reasoning (Tiqqun n.5: 12).\n3. Epistemology\n3.1 Knowledge, Belief and Intellectual Perfection\n\nLike most Medieval Aristotelians, Albalag understands the ultimate\ngoal of man in terms of intellectual perfection (Tiqqun\npreface: 2\u20133, n.30: 42; cf. Maimonides,\nGuide III:54; Farabi, Selected Aphorisms: 61;\nAverroes, Epistle on the Possibility of Conjunction: 103). To\nfulfill this goal one has to attain knowledge of existents in a manner\n\u201cthat dispels doubt\u201d (Tiqqun preface: 3). The\nformula of \u201cdispelling doubt\u201d points to the conception\nof certainty (yaq\u012bn), which is defined in the Arab\nAristotelian tradition as a cognitive state in which the cognizer\nacquiesces that what she perceived is necessarily true and cannot be\notherwise (see Black 2006: 15\u201325). In line with this tradition,\nAlbalag specifies the logical tool of demonstration as the\nmeans for fulfilling the criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e.,\nattaining certainty).\n\nThis, however, raises a difficulty, for the ultimate goal of man would\nseem to be exclusively tied to philosophy, while the role of religion\nwould be meager. Although this difficulty is not peculiar to Albalag,\nit is particularly strong in the Tiqqun where a notable\ndichotomy between \u02beemunah (belief) and\nyedi\u02bfah (scientific knowledge) serves to confine\nreligion/Scripture to a domain of knowledge that is quantitatively and\nqualitatively different from demonstrative knowledge (i.e., prophetic\nknowledge). Whether this knowledge qualifies as an alternative or a\nparallel means to philosophy in fulfilling the epistemic requirement\nof intellectual perfection is a complex question. Insofar as the\nTiqqun is concerned, \u02beemunah can rightly be\nequated with fideism (see Tiqqun n.30: 38, 51), unlike the\nphilosophical conception of belief (for which\n\u02bei\u02bftiq\u0101d and ta\u1e63d\u012bq were\nthe basic technical terms in Arabic) advocated by many Jewish and\nMuslim philosophers and theologians (see, for instance, al-Farabi \nBook of Demonstration: 63\u20134; Sa\u02bfadia Ga\u02beon \nBook of Beliefs: 14; Maimonides Guide\nI:50). In view of the latter, belief consists in judgment or\naffirmation, following from cognitive processes and syllogistic\nreasoning, that a given perceived object is true. In this way, belief\nis said to be associated with certainty or approximation of certainty\ndepending on the form of reasoning.\n\nThe Tiqqun, by contrast, points to a traditional conception\nof belief; one that amounts to simple acceptance of a given Scriptural\ndoctrine or a set of doctrines as true without prior rational\njustification (Tiqqun n.30: 51). Simple belief can always be\nregarded as a source of certainty on account of prophetic authority\nand this appears to be the basic standpoint of the Tiqqun\n(for background on the conception of belief in Jewish thought see\nWolfson 1942: 213\u2013261; Kellner 1986; Rosenberg 1984:\n273\u2013307). Yet it is important to consider the implications that\nthe Tiqqun\u2019s extreme skeptical stance in regard to\nprophetic knowledge raises for this standpoint. The Tiqqun\nencompasses a number of significant remarks stressing the\ninaccessibility of the Torah's prophetic secrets to non-prophets\n\u2014we will see below that the Torah has two layers of esoteric\nknowledge, prophetic and philosophical.  What remains is the layer of\nphilosophical knowledge to which philosophers, as Albalag points out,\ncould have access. Accessing this layer of knowledge essentially\ndepends on allegorical interpretation of Scripture in terms of what\nwas learned from demonstrative sciences (see below). This means that\nwhatever assent Scripture evokes in a person who is well-trained in\ndemonstrative sciences (i.e., a philosopher) will be of the type of\nreason-based, namely demonstrative, assent (cf. Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 17\u201318). It would, thus, be beside the point to\nspeak of \u201csimple belief\u201d (\u02beemunah pasho\u1e6dah),\nunless we grant that simple faith attaches to the surface layer of\nScripture. But this, again, would be implausible, since Albalag admits\nthat this layer is addressed to the multitude of people who,\n\u201clike animals\u201d, lack rationality, rather than philosophers\n(Tiqqun n.30: 45; for further discussion see Guttmann\n1945).\n3.2 Human Knowledge: Means and Limits \n\nAlthough Albalag does not devote a specific discussion to the theory\nof knowledge, many questions pertaining to the limit, means, and\nfeatures of human knowledge recur throughout the Tiqqun. His\ntreatment of these questions show indebtedness to Aristotelian\nepistemological theories as expounded by Arab Aristotelians, in\nparticular Averroes. Following the framework of the theory of\nrepresentational knowledge, standard among Arab Aristotelians, Albalag\ndivides knowledge into representation and assent. The former, which is\na prerequisite for the latter, is acquired by definition, while assent\nis acquired by a proof (Tiqqun [Logic]: 98; cf.\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id: 12). As noted previously, Albalag adopts\nthe Aristotelian theory of syllogism, assigning a primary significance\nto demonstrative syllogisms in evoking certain assent. Moreover,\nlike Averroes, Albalag places conspicuous emphasis on the empirical\nfoundation of human knowledge (for Averroes\u2019 epistemology see\nBlack 2019). Intelligible thoughts arise in the soul through the\ncognitive process of abstraction and syllogistic reasoning. Without\nexternal images, Albalag affirms, it would be impossible for the soul\nto apprehend the intelligible forms, just as it is impossible for a\nperson who is deprived of visual data to apprehend the quiddity of\ncolors (Tiqqun, n.11: 16, n.44: 71; cf. Aristotle \nDe Anima III, 7, 431a, 14\u201317).\n\nAlthough the Tiqqun is generally characterized by confident\nrationalism, it involves skeptical elements that echo\nMaimonides\u2019 critiques of the limitation of the human intellect\nin regard to metaphysical knowledge (for these critiques in Maimonides\nsee Pines 1979; Stern 2013). Albalag admits, like Maimonides,\nthat attaining complete knowledge of immaterial beings lies\nbeyond the capacity of the human intellect. The reason for this\nlimitation is, first and foremost, the material component of human\nbeings (\u1e25omer) which acts as both a constant impediment\nto the pursuit of knowledge and a cause of intellectual deficiency\n(Tiqqun n.11: 16, n.38: 58; cf. Guide\nIII:9).\n4. Conception of Being and God\u2019s Existence\n\nAvicenna\u2019s proof of God\u2019s existence, famously known as\n\u201cBurh\u0101n al-\u1e63idiqin\u201d, Demonstration of\nthe Truthful (Mayer 2001), occupies a good deal of Albalag\u2019s critical\ndiscussion. The proof is meant to be a metaphysical proof, one that\ntakes place in the science of Metaphysics and proceeds from analyses\nof the conception of existence qua existence.\n\nAvicenna divides \u201cactual\u201d beings, as opposed to impossible\nthings, into necessary in itself and possible in itself but necessary\nthrough another (Davidson 1987: 292\u20133; McGinnis 2010:\n159\u2013164). The necessary in itself is that which has existence in\nits essence and an impossibility arises whenever it is assumed not to\nexist. By contrast, the possible in itself but necessary through\nanother is that which \u201chas no existence in essence\u201d and\n\u201cno impossibility\u201d arises whether it is assumed to exist\nor not (Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t: 546; cf.\nal-\u02beishar\u0101t: 122; cf. al-Ghazali\nMaq\u0101\u1e63id: 100\u2013101). In other words, both\nexistence and non-existence are equal states with respect to it. This\nlatter point is crucial to Avicenna\u2019s proof, for it stipulates\nthat there must be an external cause that ultimately preponderates\nexistence over non-existence in things that are possible. This cause\nmust be necessary in itself. Considering all possible things as an\n\u201caggregate\u201d (jumlah), two alternatives arise in\nregard to the cause of that aggregate (Avicenna,\nal-Naj\u0101t: 567\u20138): either the aggregate of possible\nthings is self-caused or caused by something external. Avicenna\ndismisses the former alternative as impossible because the nature of\nwhat is possible in itself does not change independently of a cause;\npossible things become necessary only through other causes. Hence, an\naggregate of possible things is also possible in itself and cannot be\nself-caused. Furthermore, \u201ca chain\u201d (silsilah) of\npossible things cannot continue ad infinitum and it must end\nto a being that is necessary in itself. The trait of \u201cnecessary\nexistence\u201d further entails a number of divine attributes such as\noneness, simplicity and goodness, which permits identifying the\nNecessary Existent with the deity (Adamson 2013: 172).\n\nTo Albalag, Avicenna\u2019s proof of God as Necessary Existent\nappeared to involve flagrant deviations from Aristotle. Firstly,\nAvicenna\u2019s procedure for establishing the existence of the First\nPrinciple in the science of metaphysics is methodologically incorrect.\n(Tiqqun n.8: 13\u201314). Appealing to Averroes, Albalag\nargues that the existence of the prime mover must be accepted from\nnatural philosophy\u2014not insofar as it is the deity\u2014while\nmetaphysicians proceed therefrom in examining its states and\nattributes. Obviously, the theoretical basis for this argument is\nAristotle\u2019s rule that \u201cno master of any art can\ndemonstrate the proper principles of his art\u201d\n(Metaphysics IV 1003a21\u201322), which, according to\nAverroes, means that a given science does not demonstrate the\nexistence of its subject, but must concede to their existence either\nas something which is \u201cself-evident\u201d or as\n\u201csomething that has been demonstrated in another science\u201d\n(Wolfson 1950\u20131 : 691). Since the First\nPrinciple is the subject matter of metaphysics, its existence cannot\nbe established in that specific science.\n\nSecondly, Avicenna breaks away from Aristotle in that he proceeds in\nestablishing the existence of the First Principle from analyses of the\nconception of being rather than motion and moved objects (for\nAristotle\u2019s argument see Physics 7 & 8). In order\nto establish the Necessary Existent, Avicenna proceeds from a\nconception of being that Albalag, following Averroes, dismisses as\nspurious (for Averroes see al-kashf: 14). His discomfort with\nthis conception has to do primarily with the fact that it is alien to\nAristotle. But Albalag additionally speaks of errors and absurd implications,\nespecially in the science of metaphysics, that follow from\nAvicenna\u2019s method of distinguishing two types of necessary\nexistents, i.e., that which is necessary in itself and that which is\nnecessary by another. One implication pertains to the nature of\nseparate intellects. Assuming that anything which is not\nnecessary in itself involves two modes, necessity and possibility, as\nAvicenna holds, then separate intellects would also involve both\nnecessity and possibility. This, however, absurdly clashes with the\nessential nature of separate intellects as immaterial beings, since\npossibility must reside in a substratum (Tiqqun n.8: 14, \nn.29: 27).\n\nThese deviations from Aristotle provided Albalag with sufficient\nreason to reject the metaphysical proof of God. Moreover,\nAvicenna\u2019s supplementary arguments, as reproduced by al-Ghazali\nin the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, to the effect that the Necessary\nExistent is one, simple and incorporeal fall short of satisfying the\nepistemic criterion of dispelling doubt (i.e., certainty), unlike\nAristotle\u2019s argument from motion which, as Albalag asserts,\n\u201cdispels doubt\u201d (Tiqqun n.33: 53). But although\nAlbalag only trusts Aristotle\u2019s argument, he points to a subtle\nproblem whose origin goes back to ancient commentaries on Aristotle:\nthe problem of the relation of the Prime Mover to the deity (for this\nproblem see Avicenna Shif\u0101\u02be\n[Metaphysics]: 13). Aristotle\u2019s argument from motion\narrives at the existence of a mover that is not a body or a force in a\nbody. But whether that mover is the First Principle/Cause, i.e., the\ndeity, or a first effect remains an open question (Tiqqun\nn.8: 14, n.38: 61). Philosophers hold no unanimous answer to this\nquestion. While Avicenna concludes that the deity is ontologically\nsuperior to the Prime Mover known from Aristotle\u2019s analyses of\nmotion (Tiqqun n.38: 61), Averroes identifies the Prime Mover\nwith the deity in all his writings (see for instance the\nCommentary on Metaphysics: 172)\u2014the exclusion being, as\nAlbalag correctly notes, the Epitome of Metaphysics (see\nTal\u1e96\u012b\u1e63 m\u0101 ba\u02bfd\nal-\u1e6dabi\u02bfah: 149) where Averroes follows\nAvicenna\u2019s standpoint (Tiqqun n.69: 96).\n\nCuriously, Albalag does not immediately side with either camp.\nHowever, his discussions of the relation of the Prime Mover to the\ncelestial and sublunary realms confirm Averroes\u2019 standpoint by\nestablishing the primacy of the Prime Mover as a cause of all\nsublunary and celestial entities, and Its absolute unity and\nsimplicity, two essential specifications of the deity (see below).\n5. God-world Relationship\n\nTo reconstruct a rough picture of Albalag\u2019s understanding of the\nGod-world relationship, we consider three interrelated themes: the\norigin of the world, divine will, and divine wisdom.\n5.1 The Origin of the World\n\nOn scientific grounds, Albalag dismisses the doctrine of temporal\norigination as \u201cdefective\u201d and accepts the eternal\nexistence of the universe as an indisputable truth (we will see below\nthat he accepts the former on the authority of Scripture). Albalag,\nhowever, attempts to present the Aristotelian theory of eternity and\nits fundamental premises in a theologically appealing fashion. Thus,\nhe introduces the theory of \u201ceternal origination\u201d\n(\u1e25id\u016bsh ne\u1e63a\u1e25i) which maintains that\n\u201cthere was no moment at which the universe was not\noriginated\u201d (Tiqqun n.30: 30; cf. Tah\u0101fut\nal-Tah\u0101fut, Third Discussion). That the universe has no\ntemporal beginning is a premise that Albalag accepts based on\nAristotle\u2019s demonstration of the eternal existence of spheres\nand celestial motion (see for instance Tiqqun, n.30: 30,\n60:84\u201397; cf. De Caelo I: 2\u20133). What remains is\nto show that the universe is not self-sufficient. This procedure is\nnecessary in order to avoid confusing the philosophical doctrine of\neternity with that of Epicurus which maintains that \u201cthe\nuniverse has no cause\u201d (Tiqqun n.30: 45).  More\nspecifically, it shows that the philosophical conception of eternal\ncausation is not heretical and does by no means eliminate the idea of\norigination.\n\nFor this purpose, Albalag engages in a philosophical discussion in\nwhich he sets out to demonstrate the consistency of the theory of\neternal origination\u2014in addition, he offers interpretive notes to\nshow that the doctrine of eternal origination is not offensive to\nScripture (for the interpretive notes see Feldman 2000: 19\u201330).\nHis discussion indirectly links to some elements of al-Ghazali\u2019s\nrefutation of philosophers in Tah\u0101fut al-Fal\u0101sifah\nconcerning their conceptions of God and the universe.\nAl-Ghazali\u2019s central point of contention is that the\nphilosophers\u2019 exposition of the relation of God to the universe\ndwells on two premises that form an oxymoron, namely that the universe\nis eternal and that it has an Agent and Maker (see Tah\u0101fut\nal-Fal\u0101sifah third and tenth discussions). Contrary to\nal-Ghazali, Albalag holds these premises to be absolutely consistent.\nWhat is more, he introduces the theory of eternal origination as a\nmore adequate way for articulating the universe and divine causation\nthan the doctrine of temporal origination, the \u201cdefective\u201d\ndoctrine of the multitude which confines divine causation to\ntemporality. If perfection indicates absoluteness, then the term\n\u201cperfect\u201d (shalem) applies to both \u201cthe\nabsolute\u201d (mu\u1e25la\u1e6d) universe, which\neternally and immutably exists, and \u201cthe absolute\u201d Creator\nwhose act of creation is free from temporal or circumstantial\nlimitations.\n\nThe doctrine of eternal origination rests on a conception of the\nuniverse as a moving entity in which the cause-effect relationship is\na relation between a mover and a moved object (see Tiqqun\nn.30: 29; cf. Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut:  third discussion,\n101). In the natural realm, all processes of generation and corruption\nconsist in motion\u2014for instance the movement from potential to\nactual existence\u2014and occurs through motion. All natural changes\ndepend on the movements of the celestial spheres, which in turn depend\non the Mover of the outermost sphere, the Prime Mover (Tiqqun\nn.30: 29,  n.39: 62).\n\nBeyond this well-known Aristotelian conception of the Prime Mover as\nthe ultimate cause of motion in the universe, Albalag seeks to prove\nthat the very act of producing motion is sufficient to make the Prime\nMover a cause/creator of the universe. To this end, he differentiates\nbetween two classes of existents in terms of their dependence on\nmotion: \n\nexistents whose subsistence requires motion, and \n existents whose subsistence do not require motion; only\ntheir coming-to-be requires motion. \n\n\nThings belonging to the latter class continue to exist after their\ncauses perish\u2014for instance, a house continues to exist after the\ndeath of its builder. By contrast, things belonging to the former\nclass perish as soon as motion ceases\u2014for instance wind does not\ncontinue to exist as soon as the motion of air ceases (Tiqqun\n30: 30; cf. Averroes Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut, fourth\ndiscussion: 156\u20138). These things are said to be more in need of\na cause than things belonging to the former class are, for should the\ncause disappear from existence \u201cfor a twinkling of an\neye\u201d, they would necessarily perish (Tiqqun n.30: 30).\nThe universe as a whole belongs to this class. Both the natural and\ncelestial realms subsist because their constituent \u201cparts are\neternally originated\u201d through the motion produced by the Prime\nMover; the parts of the natural and celestial realms referring to\nsublunary existents and the \u201csuccessive\u201d stages of\ncelestial motion respectively (Tiqqun, n.30: 30). \n5.2 Divine Will\n\nWithin the framework of the theory of eternal creation, Albalag deals\nwith another problematic issue, which also links to al-Ghazali\u2019s\nrefutations of philosophers in Tah\u0101fut\nal-Fal\u0101sifah: the nature of divine causation, whether it is\nvoluntary or involuntary. In this treatise, Al-Ghazali maintains that\nvolition is a fundamental characteristic of acting causes; \u201cthe\nagent must be willing, choosing and knowing what he wills \u201d\n(Tah\u0101fut al-Fal\u0101sifah, third discussion:\n135). Causes that act by necessity, that is, without willing or\nchoosing, fall in the category of natural involuntary\ncauses. Proceeding from this conception of agency, Al-Ghazali asserts\nthat the conception of divine causation that philosophers espouse\ndeprives the deity of volition. Again, the theory of eternity is\nbrought into focus. Necessity is a key postulation of the scheme of\neternity. Philosophers, according to al-Ghazali, hold the perpetual\nprocession of the universe from God to be necessary in the same manner\nthat the connection between \u201cthe sun and light\u201d is\nnecessary (Tah\u0101fut, third discussion: 135;\ncf. Tiqqun n.23: 24). In opposition to al-Ghazali, Albalag\nbroadens the conception of agency to include both involuntary natural\nand voluntary causes. However, he emphasizes that a natural cause is\ninsufficient to produce an effect. It must primarily be moved by a\nvoluntary agent. In the empirical world, natural causes bring forth\neffects inasmuch as they are being moved by close or remote voluntary\nagents. In this connection, Albalag states that \u201cin this way all\nmaterial effects are related to God and it is said of Him that He is\ntheir Maker\u201d, vaguely indicating that God is the ultimate\nvoluntary cause in the universe. Other than articulating the God-world\ncausal relationship in terms of motion, Albalag barely explains the\nnature of divine will or the manner in which it causes the perpetual\nproduction of the universe.\n\nIn other contexts, Albalag argues, in opposition to al-Ghazali, that\ndivine agency is neither natural nor voluntary, but an intermediary\ntype that lies beyond human understanding. This, however, does not\nmean that God has no will. The truth is that God has a capacity that\nconstitutes for Him what will constitutes for human beings. The exact\nnature of this capacity, which human beings call will, is obscure,\neven though demonstration establishes that it exists. Nonetheless,\nconsidering the defining criteria of the conception of divine\nperfection, it is inferred that this capacity shares no features with\nempirical will. Unlike empirical will which follows from a stimulus\nand seeks to fulfill a desire, divine will is self-sufficient. While\nempirical will is temporal, originates with a stimulus and perishes as\nsoon as the desire is fulfilled, divine will, consistently with the\neternal and immutable nature of God, is eternal and immutable, being\ncharacterized as a benevolent and immutable capacity to eternally\n\u201cchoose\u201d the best of two opposite things: \n\n\nEven though He possesses power over everything, the manner of His will\nis such that it constantly attaches itself to a single object, the\nbest among two opposites. Certainly, if He willed evil He would be\ncapable of doing it, but His will desires nothing but what is good\nonly. (Tiqqun n.23: 24 [my translation]; cf. Guide\nIII:25 where Maimonides states that God acts in the best way) \n\n\nOn this basis, the universe maintains a fixed natural order such that\n\u201cnothing can be added to or reduced from it\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.30: 39), since God\u2019s will continuously and\nimmutably chooses this order.\n5.3 Divine Knowledge\n\nIf God possesses will, then He must also possess wisdom, since\ndeliberation and choosing assume knowledge of the thing that is\nwilled. That is to say, the God-world relationship is based on will\nand wisdom. In discussing the nature of divine knowledge, Albalag\ndisplays an obsession with divine perfection. Thus, he differentiates\nbetween divine and human knowledge on the basis of type rather than\nrank, removing any ground for comparing them or inferring premises\nabout God\u2019s mode of apprehension and knowledge from the\ncharacteristics of human knowledge and cognition. This idea of the\ndistinctiveness of divine knowledge, and, indeed all divine\nattributes, is best expressed in terms of Maimonides\u2019 theory of\nequivocation. According to Maimonides, terms such as wisdom, power and\nwill are predicated of God and creatures only equivocally. When\npredicated of God and other creatures, these terms are semantically\ndissimilar, sharing only the names rather than meaning (Guide\nI:56; cf. Tiqqun n.23: 24). Epistemologically speaking,\nmoreover, they are not informative; constituting an artificial\nlanguage, which we predicate of God owing to our inability to fathom\nand signify the corresponding characteristics in Him (Benor 1995;\nStern 2013: 198\u2013204).\n\nOn this conception of divine attributes, Albalag examines\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of divine knowledge, as reproduced by\nal-Ghazali in the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, according to which\n\u201cGod knows particulars in a universal fashion\u201d\n(Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 118). Avicenna\u2019s theory of divine\nknowledge has been subject to different interpretations (Marmura 1962:\n299\u2013312; Adamson 2005: 257\u2013278; Belo 2006: 177\u2013199).\nFor Albalag, it simply means that God\u2019s knowledge is universal.\nSince this way of articulating divine knowledge implies a\ncorrespondence between divine and human knowledge, Albalag naturally\nrejects it and scolds al-Ghazali for diffusing improper doctrines\nabout God. In opposition, he insists that God\u2019s knowledge is\nopposite in characteristics, not merely superior in rank, to human\nknowledge: it is neither particular nor universal, it is atemporal,\nindivisible, absolutely actual and self-sufficient, being exclusively\ndependent on the mode of self-intellection which is peculiar to God\nand separate intellects (Tiqqun n.42:  76).\n\nGiven this radical notion of transcendency, it would seem that the\ncelestial realm and sublunary species and individuals lie beyond the\ndomain of God\u2019s knowledge. But Albalag insists that God\u2019s\nknowledge is all-encompassing. To establish this, he appropriates\nAverroes\u2019 conception of the divine essence as a unified Form of\nthe forms of all existents (Averroes Commentary on\nMetaphysics: 197). Through the very act of self-intellection,\nGod, as Albalag concludes, apprehends all existents, including\nsublunary existents (Tiqqun n.42: 66). This conclusion is\naccompanied by an important clarification for the sake of maintaining\ndivine perfection and transcendence unimpaired: forms contained in the\nessence of God do not exactly correspond to the forms of sublunary\nthings insofar as they are material objects, but exist in the divine\nessence in the noblest possible manner, being absolutely simple,\nindivisible and independent of accidents.\n5.4 The Problem of Determinism\n\nIn the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, al-Ghazali restates the basic\nelements of Avicenna\u2019s deterministic metaphysics and its\nimplication for the nature and domain of divine knowledge. He\nexplains, in light of Avicenna\u2019s conception of being, the manner\nin which God knows future events. Possible things are necessitated by\ntheir causes; when a cause exists, the effect must necessarily follow.\nAs such, knowledge of a cause allows one to predict, beyond doubt, the\noccurrence of the associated effect or event. Inasmuch as God has\ncomplete knowledge of the hierarchy of the causes, He has knowledge of\nall future events (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 118; cf. Avicenna \nal-Naj\u0101t: 587\u2013599)\n\nFor Albalag, this deterministic worldview on which al-Ghazali\u2019s\naccount of God\u2019s knowledge of future events dwells follows from\na narrow understanding of the cause-effect relationship. Possible\nthings, according to Albalag, are realized by either material or\nefficient causes, or both. Some of these causes are either volitional\nor natural. Volitional causes, \u201chinge solely on the power of the\nchooser\u201d, which means that effects are not necessary and cannot\nbe predicted. Effects arising from natural causes are necessary, only\nwhen the natural causes are necessary, that is, when they maintain a\nfixed order and cannot be hindered by other accidental or voluntary\ncauses. An example of this is a solar eclipse. Foreknowledge of this\nevent and ones like it are correspondingly necessary with respect to\nthe knower. By contrast, some natural causes, despite having an\norder, can be impeded by voluntary or accidental causes. In such\ncases, the effects are not necessary, and hence it is not possible to\nmake certain predictions about their occurrence. \n\n\nI maintain that for any possible thing, if all its proximate an remote\ncauses succeed each other essentially and maintain order in their\nactions, and no hindrance can prevent any of them, then it is to be\njudged the same as a necessary thing with respect to knower. However,\nregarding other possible things one cannot know with certain knowledge\nthe fact or the time of their occurrence before their occurrence.\n(quotation from Manekin 2007: 141)\n\n\nAlbalag is aware that this note entails a denial of God\u2019s\nknowledge of every future event. For this reason, he clarifies that\nhis intention is not to propose that God is ignorant of future events,\nfor, indeed, he thinks that God knows them, but in a manner that is\ndifferent from human knowledge.\n\nAlthough Albalag is critical, overall, of al-Ghazali\u2019s account\nof God\u2019s foreknowledge, he recommends teaching it to the\nmultitude because it is easy for them to comprehend. Albalag still\npoints to the theological implication associated with it. \n\n\nWhen you examine al-Ghazali\u2019s statements carefully you will find\nthat they entail the annulment of man\u2019s choice and the\nconclusion that his actions are compelled, as well as the annulment of\nthe nature of the possible altogether. These opinions not only\nconstitute repudiation of philosophy but also heresy with respect the\nTorah. (Quotation from Manekin 2007: 142)\n\n6. Cosmology\n\nIn discussing the fundamental traits of the Necessary Existent,\nal-Ghazali considers the implications of the divine attribute of\nabsolute simplicity to the scope of divine causation and conception of\nthe universe. Al-Ghazali explains, following Avicenna, that from what\nis one and simple (i.e., the Necessary Existent) only one thing may\nproceed (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 157;\ncf. al-Shif\u0101\u02be [Metaphysics]:\n326\u2013334; al-Naj\u0101t: 649\u2013657). Underlying this\nunderstanding of the scope of divine causation is a conception of the\nrelationship between cause and effect as one of correspondence;\n\u201cthe action must be consistent with the essential nature of its\ncause\u201d (Kogan 1984: 249). Thus, a single cause has one act and\nproduces only a single effect. In keeping with this conception, and\nconsidering the absolute simplicity of the First Principle,\nal-Ghazali, describes an emanationist cosmology in which the First\nPrinciple causes multiplicity not directly, but through a\nchain of emanative intermediaries that successively proceed from one\nanother. The First Principle produces only one entity, the first\nintellect, by thinking Itself. In turn, the first intellect produces,\nby thinking its Cause and itself, the second intellect and the first\ncelestial sphere (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 157). The reason for\nthis multiplicity is that the first intellect is not absolutely simple\nlike the First Principle, but complex: in addition to thinking its\nPrinciple, it thinks itself insofar as it is possible and insofar as\nit is necessary by virtue of the First Principle. The process of\nemanation continues in a descending manner, terminating with the\nActive Intellect, the intellect of the sphere of the moon which is the\nimmediate source of the forms of sublunary entities.\n\nConvinced that the scheme of emanation constitutes an unsatisfactory\ndeviation from Aristotle, Albalag devotes extensive discussions to\nelucidating its inconsistency and fallacies, and alternatively\nestablishing what he regards as the correct Aristotelian scheme.\nUnlike the scheme of emanation, this scheme ascribes the\nuniverse\u2019s manifold existents to God\u2019s direct causation:\n\u201cfrom what is one and simple many things can come to be\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.96:\n 69).[2]\n Albalag describes a hierarchical cosmological scheme of separate\nintellects and celestial spheres in which each separate intellect\nrelates to the corresponding sphere as a cause of motion while the\nFirst Principle/Intellect relates to all separate intellects as a\ndirect formal\n cause.[3]\n Two theories account for this cosmological scheme: \n\nthe theory of divine knowledge, which, as illustrated formerly,\nmaintains that the First Intellect apprehends the forms of all\nexistents by thinking Its essence, and \n the Aristotelian theory of \u201ccognitive identification\u201d\naccording to which the knowing subject, the known object and thinking\nare identical in actual thinking (for further details about this\ntheory see Black 1999). \n\n\nBy definition, separate intellects are intellects in actu\nwhose substantiation is the very act of thinking. Without\nknowledge, the essence of the separate intellect would be nullified.\nThus, separate intellects, just like the First Intellect, have actual\nknowledge of the forms of all existents. In actual thinking, the\nknower, the known object, and the act of thinking are identical\n(Tiqqun n.42: 65), the relationship of identity being\nparticularly formal as Aristotle\u2019s dictum of cognitive\nidentification establishes (De Anima 3.8 431b21). This means\nthat in separate intellects \u201cessence/form\u201d, the known\nobject and the act of thinking are the same. In this way, the First\nIntellect is said to be \u201cthe formal cause\u201d of the separate\nintellects on the grounds that It provides them with \u201ctheir\nforms\u201d, i.e., the intelligible forms which they apprehend and by\nmeans of which they are what they are, intellects in actu\n(Tiqqun n.69:\n 98).[4]\n\nThis cosmological account, however, calls for explaining how separate\nintellects are differentiated. After all, separate intellects share\nthe feature of immateriality, hence they cannot be numbered.\nFurthermore, considering the fact that separate intellects share the\nsame epistemological content (i.e., the forms of all existents derived\nfrom the First Intellect) and that the knower is identical with the\nobject known, according to the Aristotelian dictum of \u201ccognitive\nidentity\u201d, separate intellects should all be identical. In the\nAvicennian-emanative scheme, intellects are numbered on account of the\ncausal relation between them, each intellect being the cause of an\nintellect emanating from it and \u201conly God, who is at the top of\nthe series is an uncaused caused\u201d (Wolfson 1958 : 244). By\nrejecting the conception of an emanative causal relationship between\nintellects, Albalag, however, could not speak of a distinction in\nterms of causal relation. Alternatively, he follows Averroes in\npositing ontological hierarchy as the differentiating factor between\nintellects (Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut: fifth discussion:\n173). While each separate intellect derives its knowledge directly\nfrom the First Intellect, each stands in a specific hierarchical\nrelation to the First Intellect, the ranking of each intellect being\nin accordance with the extent of purity of its mode of apprehension;\nthe purer and simpler the mode of apprehension the closer the\nintellect in rank to the First Intellect. Overlap between these modes\nis not possible, which ensures that separate intellects remain\ndifferentiated.\n\nBeyond this cosmological account, Albalag indicates that multiplicity\nin the sublunary realm also comes forth from the deity; the First is\nsaid to be the cause of multiplicity inasmuch as It is the ultimate\ncause of the cosmic unity. Were it not for the unifying force that\nholds the parts together, the universe as a totality and its\nparts\u2014each of which comes to be by virtue of a unifying force\nthat conjoins its constituent parts like matter and form and the\nelements\u2014would not exist (Tiqqun n.69: 97; cf.\nAverroes Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut, third discussion:\n108).\n7. Celestial Motion\n\nIn the Avicennian-emanative scheme celestial motion is ascribed to two\nprinciples: \n\n proximate movers (internal souls), and \n the separate unmoved intellects corresponding to the concentric\nspheres. \n\n\nWhereas the soul functions as the efficient cause of motion, the\nseparate unmoved movers function as the final cause of motion insofar\nas they represent an object of love and desire. The point is that\nsince celestial souls are corporeal and finite, they are insufficient\nto account for the spheres\u2019 perpetual activities. The\nperpetuation of motion, accordingly, must be the function of\nimmaterial and incorruptible principles. These are the unmoved\nseparate intellects of which the mover of the outermost spheres is the\nhighest in rank (Avicenna Shif\u0101\u02be\n[Metaphysics]: 308; cf. Maq\u0101\u1e63id:\n149).\n\nAs with many of Avicenna\u2019s theories, Albalag raises a number of\nobjections to this account of celestial motion. Firstly, Albalag\ndismisses the conception of complementary efficient-final causation as\nunwarranted, since, in his understanding, a final cause could hardly\ncontinue the activity of a terminated efficient cause. Secondly,\nAlbalag rejects the theory of the spheres\u2019 animation by souls\n(For background on this theory see Wolfson 1962: 65\u2013 93;\nFreudenthal 2002: 111\u2013137).  His argument against that theory\nproceeds from the eternity premise as follows. Forces inhering in\nbodies (including celestial bodies) are finite. As such, they could\nhardly move the body in which they inhere infinitely. But we know that\nthe nature of spheres is such that they move eternally and this means\nthat celestial souls are superfluous in this regard. That Nature\n(ha teva\u02bf) \u201cdoes nothing in vain\u201d\n(cf. Aristotle Politics 1252b30\u20131253a1;\nAverroes Commentary on Metaphysics: 178) prompts the\nconclusion that spheres do not have souls (Tiqqun n.61: 87).\nAlthough the basic lines of this argument are derived from Averroes,\nAlbalag seems to adopt a firmer position than Averroes in denying the\nanimation of spheres by souls. While Averroes rejects Avicenna\u2019s\ntwofold account of celestial motion and argues in some of his works\n(especially De Substantia Orbis: 71; cf. Commentary on\nMetaphysics: 164) that celestial motion could hardly be dependent\non a finite force inhering in the celestial body, he uses the term\nsoul interchangeably with form in reference to the principles of\nmotion in celestial spheres: the immaterial separate intellects. In\nother works, we still find indications that spheres are ensouled\n(e.g., Tah\u0101fut al-Tah\u0101fut, fourth discussion).\nThese variations in Averroes\u2019 standpoint in regard to the theory\nof the spheres\u2019 animation by souls have invited different\ninterpretations (see Donati 2015; Kogan 1984: 190\u2013201).\n\nAs for Albalag, his account of celestial motion consistently\nattributes celestial motion to the efficient, formal and final\ncausation of separate intellects. Relaying on Averroes, while giving\nthe credit to Aristotle, Albalag argues that the three modes of\ncausation are one in the divine realm (cf. Averroes Commentary on\nMetaphysics: 149). While separate intellects are themselves\ninvariable, they produce motion in the spheres in three different\nmanners (Tiqqun n.64: 92).\n8. The Relationship Between Religion and Philosophy\n\nAlbalag is most famous in modern scholarship for his view of the\nrelationship between religion and philosophy. In the context of\nmedieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, he stands out as perhaps the only\nphilosopher to straightforwardly stress, accept and account for the\ntension between philosophy and prophetic knowledge. His name is\nusually connected with the doctrine of the \u201cdouble truth\u201d,\nwhich maintains that the truth of prophecy and the truth of philosophy\nmay contradict each other while at the same time remaining\nsimultaneously true (Sirat 1985: 238; Zinberg 1973:\n107]; Vajda 1960: 264\u2013265). The origin of this doctrine had long\nbeen attributed to Averroes and Latin Averroists until recent studies\nchallenged this attribution. Some scholars have argued that the double\ntruth doctrine never existed as an actual dogma (Dales 1984).\nSimilarly, some scholars question the attribution of the double truth\ndoctrine to Albalag (Guttmann 1966: 227\u2013229) and Elijah\nDelmedigo, another Jewish Averroist whose treatment of the question in\ndiscussion involves some elements alluding to the double truth\ndoctrine (for Delmedigo, see Fraenkel 2013).\n\nThe discussion of the question of the relationship between religion\nand philosophy in the Tiqqun is complex and spans a number of\ncontexts. On the one hand, Albalag states in the preface to the\nTiqqun that there is no essential distinction between\nphilosophy and the Torah except that the former, addressing the select\nfew, conveys the truth in a demonstrative manner, while the latter,\naddressing the multitude, conveys the truth in a figurative language\nin accordance with their limited comprehension. By this means, Albalag\nseems to align with the understanding of religion as an imitation of\nphilosophy which was founded by al-Farabi and adopted by many Muslim\nand Jewish philosophers, most significantly Averroes and arguably\nMaimonides (see al-Farabi The Book of Letters: 19\u201326;\nMaimonides Guide: preface; Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 1\u20133, 7\u201310). Both philosophers not only\nmaintain that religion and philosophy are compatible, but also accord\nphilosophy a crucial role in arriving at the true meaning of Scripture\n(Maimonides Guide: preface; Averroes Decisive\nTreatise: 1\u20133, 7\u201310). Furthermore, Averroes sets\nforth a religious epistemology based on the principle that\n\u201ctruth does not oppose truth; rather, it agrees with and bears\nwitness to it\u201d (Decisive: 9). On this principle,\ncontradictions between al-Shari\u02bfah (Religious Law) and\nphilosophy are viewed as mere apparent, rather than essential,\ncontradictions that result from the literary form of\nScripture\u2014consisting in similes, metaphors and\nstories\u2014which is directed to the multitude. Since\nal-Shari\u02bfah cares for all people, \u201cthe red and\nblack\u201d, it conveys the truth in different methods in accordance\nwith the diverse intellectual capacities of people and types of assent\nthey are fit for (ibid, 8). Only those who are adept in science\n(al-rasi\u1e96una fi-l\u02bfilm) can have access to the\ninternal meaning of Scripture, which is designed according to the\ntruth as it is, thereby attaining certain, demonstrative, assent to\nScripture. Drawing on Averroes\u2019 religious epistemology,\npost-Maimonidean philosophers, continuing Maimonides\u2019\nphilosophical-religious \nenterprise,[5] \nundertook to interpret Judaism as \u201ca philosophical\nreligion\u201d by giving principles of Judaism that appeared to be in\nconflict with philosophy naturalistic interpretations (for the concept\nof philosophical religion see Fraenkel 2012: 5). In a similar vein,\nAlbalag engages in allegorical interpretations of some elements of the\nAccount of the Beginning, stating, in an obviously apologetic tone,\nthat \u201cit is possible to extract the philosophical doctrine of\neternal creation from the Torah\u201d (Tiqqun n.30,\n33). \n\nOn the other hand, Albalag reveals ambivalence about the feasibility\nof the philosophical approach to religion. His main stated concern is\nthat the true meaning of Scripture is not readily accessible. The\nreason is that prophetic knowledge, as Albalag repeatedly affirms, is\nexclusive to prophets and even the ablest philosopher has no access to\nthe \u201cintention\u201d of the prophet. Thus, when philosophers\nassign philosophical meanings to verses of the Torah they may just be\nswerving away from their actual tenor. Albalag finds Maimonides to be\nparticularly at fault in this regard and therefore he labels him as\none of the \u201chasty\u201d people (nemharim) of our time\nwho did harm not only to \u201cfaith\u201d, but also to\n\u201cwisdom\u201d (Tiqqun n.1: 5; Tiqqun n.30:\n44). In their attempts to rationally support religious doctrines they\nacted \u201cwith ignorance\u201d as they \n\n denied demonstrative philosophical doctrines, advocating,\ninstead, weak speculative arguments, and \n unhesitatingly ascribed meanings to Scripture in terms of these\narguments and based on their understanding of Scripture. \n\n\nTwo points of contention seem to underlie this critique. The first is\nthat those \u201chasty\u201d people tend to compromise philosophy in\norder to satisfy theological considerations. The second is sceptical.\nWhile many philosophers confidently interpret Scripture allegorically\non the assumption that the internal meaning of Scripture accords with\nphilosophy, Albalag merges his interpretive notes on the Account of\nthe Beginning\u2014the sole context where he offers interpretations\nof that sort\u2014with remarks emphasizing the inaccessibility of\nprophetic knowledge to non-prophets.\n\nIn response, Albalag offers what may be characterized as a restrictive\nscheme for interpreting the Jewish Scripture in terms of philosophy.\nThis scheme regards demonstration as the means for attaining\nthe truth and Scripture as a divine source for the truth. Scripture\ncontains two layers of secrets: philosophical and prophetic. A\nphilosopher arrives at the former layer by engaging in allegorical\ninterpretation after he has obtained knowledge through demonstrative\nreasoning: \n\n\nfor one who seeks the truth, it is not proper [for him] to seek its\npremises from what he apprehends from Scripture by his own effort\nwithout primarily [engaging in] demonstrative reasoning. Rather, he\nhas to learn the truth first through demonstration and thereafter seek\nsupport from Scripture. (Tiqqun n.30: 37; cf. Averroes \nDecisive Treatise: 7) \n\n\nWhen Scripture does not agree with demonstrative knowledge, this\npoints to the presence of a deeper layer of secrets, prophetic secrets\nto which only a prophet has access. On this occasion, the disharmony\nbetween demonstrative and prophetic knowledge is treated with fideism,\nby accepting the Scriptural doctrine on the basis of simple faith. One\nshould not, however, abandon the demonstrative doctrine. Both\ndoctrines remain \u201ctrue\u201d (\u02beemet) to the\nphilosopher-believer.\n\nThese claims lie behind the attribution of the double truth doctrine\nto Albalag in modern scholarship. It should be noted, however, that\nthe scope of application of the double truth doctrine in the\nTiqqun is meagre, being limited to the tension between\nreligion and philosophy in regard to the issue of the origin of the\nworld. Towards the end of his discussion of this issue Albalag\ndeclares that he accepts as \u201ctrue\u201d both the philosophical\ndoctrine of eternal creation and the biblical doctrine of temporal\ncreation, the former based on analysis of \u201cnature\u201d and by\nmeans of \u201cdemonstration\u201d and the latter based on\n\u201cthe authority of the prophet by way of miracle\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.30: 52). This peculiar way of treating the question\nof the relationship between religion and philosophy draws a parting\nline between Albalag and the tradition of Arab Aristotelians and\nJewish Averroists in which religion and philosophy are held to be\nseemingly different representations of the same truth. \n9. Theory of Prophecy\n\nUnderlying the double truth doctrine is a unique theory of prophecy\nthat credits Albalag with novelty. Deviating from the widely accepted\nconception of prophecy in medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy,\nwhich views prophets as accomplished philosophers and qualitatively\nequates prophetic knowledge with philosophy, this theory links\nprophets and prophetic knowledge to the divine realm (i.e., the realm\nof separate intellects) while at the same time stressing the absolute\ntranscendence and unknowability of that realm. It correspondingly\nstresses essential distinctions between philosophical reasoning and\nknowledge, on the one hand, and prophecy and prophetic knowledge, on\nthe other. Prophets, according to Albalag, are extraordinary human\nbeings endowed with a special mode of apprehension. Thanks to this\nmode of apprehension prophets have access to knowledge that differs\nfrom philosophical knowledge in both content and type. Not only do\nprophets arrive at answers to questions that lie beyond the capacity\nof human reason, but they also grasp the truth in a transcendent\nmanner, independently of physical tools and the cognitive processes\nnecessary for rational knowledge (Guttmann 1945: 86).\n\n\nTheir [the philosopher\u2019s and prophet\u2019s] modes of\napprehension are distinct. Not only that, but they are [like two]\nopposites, since this [the philosopher] perceives intelligible [forms]\nthrough sensory objects, whereas the latter [the prophet] perceives\nsensory objects through intelligible [forms]. (Tiqqun n.30:\n44 [my translation])\n\n\nThis note suggests that the prophetic mode of apprehension is similar\nto that of separate intellects which is described in the\nTiqqun in similar terms: \u201cif there exists a separate\nintellect in the universe whose knowledge is not obtained through\nphysical tools\u201d, its \u201cgrasp of things would be completely\nopposite to that of the human [intellect]\u201d\n(Tiqqun n.11: 16; cf. n.42: 67). The distinction in the mode\nof apprehension entails fundamental distinctions in the\ncharacteristics of the perceived knowledge. Human knowledge passes\nfrom potentiality to actuality. It is either universal or particular.\nIt is temporal and involves features of multiplicity, compositeness\nand materiality. By contrast, divine knowledge is transcendent; it is\n\u201cneither particular nor universal.\u201d It is constantly\nactual and absolutely indivisible, simple and atemporal\n(Tiqqun n.42: 67). In this way, prophetic knowledge, like\nknowledge of the separate intellects, is said to be qualitatively\ndistinct from philosophical knowledge. Radically maximizing the\ndistinction between prophecy and philosophy, Albalag emphasizes the\npossibility of contradiction. \n\n\nJust as the ways through which they [the philosopher and the prophet]\napprehend things are so distinct, their respective grasps of things\nare so distinct that it is possible for the former [the philosopher]\nto perceive from below [based on nature and reasoning] the opposite\n(hefekh) of what the latter [the prophet] perceives from\nabove. (Tiqqun n.30: 45 [my translation])\n\n\nThis theory of prophecy parts ways with the standard contemporary\ntheory of prophecy according to which prophets are accomplished\nphilosophers endowed with a strong imaginative faculty. By virtue of\nthis faculty, prophets, unlike philosophers, are able to carry out the\nnecessary political role of establishing laws conducive to the welfare\nof society, and reformulate theoretical knowledge in a language easy\nfor the multitude to understand. Whatever theoretical knowledge a\nprophet attains through emanation from the Active Intellect\u2014the\nintellect of the sphere of the moon to which philosophers variably\nascribed epistemological and ontological roles in the sublunary\nrealm\u2014accords with philosophical knowledge; the difference being\nparticularly quantitative (Macy 1986; Rahman 1958). Even the\nAvicennian theory of prophecy, which links the prophetic mind to the\ndivine realm, does not ascribe to prophetic knowledge a specific\nqualitative merit above philosophical knowledge; prophets apprehend\nthe principles of all existents, the middle term of every syllogism\nand intelligible forms instantaneously and effortlessly through divine\nintuition (\u1e25ads). (Rahman, 1958: 32; Marmura 1963:\n49\u201351; Morris 1992: 84). That is, there are no grounds for\ncontradiction, as Albalag\u2019s theory of prophecy suggests.\n10. Political Thought\n\nIn the context of medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, political\nthought was largely concerned with investigating the connection\nbetween social good and human happiness, on the one hand, and\nphilosophy and religion on the other. In the last section of the\nMetaphysics of the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, al-Ghazali\nrecapitulates Avicenna\u2019s view of the relationship between social\nwelfare and religion. Proceeding from the Aristotelian dictum that\n\u201cman is political by nature\u201d (Aristotle  Politics\n1252b30\u20131253a1), al-Ghazali stresses that human beings cannot\ndispense with social interaction and cooperation for fulfilling their\nbasic needs and for the sake of attaining the highest good of man.\nThis, however, is not possible unless society is stable and justly\ngoverned. The realization of these conditions is tied to the existence\nof a lawgiver that enacts laws and promotes doctrines that are\nconducive to the social and spiritual well-being.\n\nRemarkably, Albalag starts the Tiqqun with the political\ntheme with which al-Ghazali concludes the Maq\u0101\u1e63id.\nThe preface to the Tiqqun offers a gloss on the political\nnature of human beings, emphasizing the essentiality of society to the\nindividual\u2019s well-being and human survival in general. But,\nagain, society can be conducive to well-being only under specific\ncircumstances. From the point of view of a Medievalist like Albalag,\npluralism stands as a major enemy to social stability. The more\ndiversified the society the less stable and more conflict-fraught it\nis. Pluralism may result in constant warring among people to such an\nextent as to threaten human existence. Thus comes the need for a\nlawgiver who promotes social harmony by unifying people in creed and\npraxis.\n\nAlbalag accommodates the Torah into this political theme, assigning it\na crucial role in establishing social and political order and\nmaintaining the divinely ordained perpetual existence of the human\nspecies. Nothing in this outlook deviates from the view of Medieval\nAristotelians regarding the socio-political benefit of Divine Law.\nMaimonides, for instances, deems the Torah a key factor in the\nestablishment and preservation of social well-being. Still Albalag\ndeparts from Maimonides, as well as prominent Muslim philosophers such\nas al-Farabi and Averroes, in that he confines the Torah to this\nspecific socio-political purpose. These philosophers define divine Law\nin terms of its goal: unlike man-made laws which care only for the\nwelfare of society, divine Law cares for both the welfare of society\nand welfare of the soul (Fraenkel 2012: 175; Z. Harvey 1980:\n199\u2013200). Maimonides particularly emphasizes that the\nTorah\u2019s goal does not exclusively focus on the practical domain\nand that it concerns itself with theoretical virtues. Even practical\nactions prescribed in the Torah are conducive to the fulfillment of\nthe commandment to \u201clove the Lord\u201d (Deuteronomy\n6:4\u20135), which in Maimonides\u2019 interpretation is an\ninjunction for the true worship of God: intellectual worship. The\nTorah, accordingly, calls upon people to seek knowledge of all\nexistents by virtue of which man attains intellectual perfection,\ntruly worshiping God (Eight Chapters: 78; cf. Guide\nIII:53).\n\nUnlike Maimonides, Albalag scarcely associates the Torah with any\nexplicit role in promoting theoretical virtues. Indeed, he\ndifferentiates between philosophy and the Torah in terms of their\nrespective final goals. While philosophy aims for the happiness of the\nselect few, the Torah aims for the happiness of the multitude, the\nformer type of happiness is intellectual whereas the latter is\nexclusively civic. In this connection, Albalag defines four basic\nprinciples of the Torah, which, as he states, are also foundational to\nphilosophy and religious systems. These principles are: \n\n reward and punishment, \n the survival of the soul after death, \n the existence of a deity that rewards and punishes, and \n the existence of a divine providence that watches over human\nbeings, each according to his deeds.\n\n\nAs many scholars noted, these four principles belong to the category\nof principles that are necessary for social well-being (Touati 1962:\n44\u201347; Schweid 2008: 320\u2013321; Guttmann 1945:\n90\u201391). Furthermore, Albalag explains that the Torah adopts a\nstrategy of concealment. Revealing or concealing doctrines is\ndetermined on the basis of their respective benefits to society and\nsocial well-being. All in all, the preface to the Tiqqun\nstresses the value of the Torah as a political treatise that is\nnecessary for the establishment of justice and social well-being.\n11. Conclusion\n\nSefer Tiqqun ha de\u02bfot represents a significant\ndevelopment in the domain of Jewish thought in particular and\nphilosophy in general. In a time when post-Maimonidean philosophers\nexerted efforts to enhance the philosophical-religious\nenterprise of Maimonides (as they understood Maimonides\u2019\nenterprise to be), Albalag highlights the shortcomings of that\nenterprise, advocating as an alternative the double truth doctrine. In\napplication, however, this doctrine is strikingly restricted to a very\nnarrow scope, while the superiority of philosophy as a source of true\nknowledge and certainty is made noticeable throughout the\nTiqqun. Unlike the religious domain in which truth is\nqualified by degrees, the ultimate of which being exclusively\naccessible to prophets, and subject to human interpretations, truth in\nthe philosophical domain is absolute. It can be obtained through\ndemonstrative reasoning and learned from Aristotelian sciences. It is\nthis understanding of philosophical truth that motivated Albalag to\nundertake scrutiny of the philosophical discourse in order to purge it\nfrom errors and reinstate correct Aristotelianism, as he understands\nit through the writings of Averroes, the Commentator. On the whole,\nAlbalag\u2019s enterprise marks an attempt to break away from\nsome of the major Neo-Platonic trends that had characterized the\nAvicennian-Farabian interpretation of Aristotle.\n",
