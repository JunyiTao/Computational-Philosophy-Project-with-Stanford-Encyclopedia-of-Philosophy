    "main_text": "Design Approaches in Biology || Designing and Understanding Life\n2.1 Designing and Understanding Life\n\nSystems and synthetic biology offer new opportunities to reconsider\nthe prospects and limitations of engineering approaches for biological\nresearch (Braillard 2015; Calcott et al. 2015). Engineering approaches\nare often considered inadequate to grasp biological complexity.\nSpecifically, design thinking has often been associated with\nadaptationism, i.e., the assumption that biological traits are\noptimally \u201cdesigned\u201d by natural selection (Orzack &\nForber 2010). Accordingly, critics have argued that the engineering\napproach may lead to a simplified understanding of evolution as driven\nsolely by natural selection (Lynch 2007). But whereas some approaches\nin systems biology can be described as adaptationist (Green 2014), it\ncannot be assumed that design approaches always entail adaptationist\nimplications. Systems biologists may adopt a \u2018thin\u2019 notion\nof design focusing primarily on the relations between structures and\nfunctions (Green et al. 2015b). Because research in systems and\nsynthetic biology often is often dissociated from evolutionary\nconsiderations, these research practices may force philosophers to\nreexamine the concepts of biological function and design beyond\ntraditional aetiological accounts (Holm 2012; Preston 2008; see also\nMossio et al. 2009).\n\nIn this context, it is debatable whether the thin notion of design is\ncompatible with biological complexity. Some scholars have raised\nconcerns that the machine-view of organisms (and use of design\nmetaphors) may lead to a neglect of distinct biological features such\nas autonomy, evolvability, and intrinsic purposiveness (Nicholson\n2019; see also Jacob 1977; Kogge & Richter 2013; McLeod and\nNerlich 2017). Design approaches may implicitly enforce the view that\noperations and outputs of specific parts are stable and predictable\nacross different contexts. In biology, context-sensitivity and\ndegeneracy between genotype-phenotype-relations may provide severe\nlimitations to the utility of this heuristic (Boudry & Pigliucci\n2013; G\u00fcttinger 2013; see also\n Section 3.1).\n Yet, as outlined in the following sections, the ties to engineering\nare multi-faceted in both systems and synthetic biology.\n",
