    "main_text": "Diversity\u2019s Dominion\n7. Diversity\u2019s Dominion\n\n\nHow, if it held the Medical School\u2019s policy unconstitutional, did\nJustice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion become the basis upon which\nuniversities across the land enacted\u2014or\nmaintained\u2014racially preferential admissions policies?\n\n\nIf Powell had concluded with his assessment of the Medical School\u2019s\nfour justifications, Bakke would have left university\naffirmative action in a precarious situation. However, he didn\u2019t stop\nthere. In an earlier ruling on Bakke\u2019s lawsuit, the California Supreme\nCourt had forbidden the Medical School to make any use of race or\nethnicity in its admissions decisions. Powell thought this went too\nfar. Given higher education\u2019s protected interest in\n\u201cdiversity,\u201d and given that a student\u2019s race or ethnicity\nmight add to diversity just in the same way that her age, work\nexperience, family background, special talents, foreign language\nfluency, athletic prowess, military service, and unusual\naccomplishments might, Powell vacated that portion of the California\nSupreme Court\u2019s order.\n\n\nThen he added some dicta for guidance. If universities want to\nunderstand diversity and the role that race and ethnicity might play in\nachieving it, they should look to Harvard, proposed Powell, and he\nappended to his opinion a long statement of Harvard\u2019s affirmative action program.\nIn such a program, Powell contended, racial or ethnic background\nmight\n\n\nbe deemed a \u201cplus\u201d in a particular applicant\u2019s file, yet\nit does not insulate the individual from comparison with all other\ncandidates for the available seats.\u2026This kind of program treats\neach applicant as an individual in the admissions process. The\napplicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate\nreceiving a \u201cplus\u201d on the basis of ethnic background will\nnot have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply\nbecause he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would\nmean only that his combined qualifications\u2026did not outweigh\nthose of the other applicant. His qualifications would have been\nweighed fairly and competitively, and he would have had no basis to\ncomplain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth\n Amendment (Bakke, at 318, 319).\n\n\n\nIn these off-hand comments, universities saw a green light for pushing\nahead aggressively with their affirmative action programs.  Justice\nPowell\u2019s basic holding could not have been plainer: any system like\nthe Medical School\u2019s that assessed applications along two different\ntracks defined by race or that used numerical racial quotas must fail\nconstitutional muster. Yet by the mid-1980s universities across the\nland had in place systems of admissions and scholarships that\nexhibited one or both of these features. When the University of\nMaryland\u2019s Banneker scholarships\u2014awarded only to\nAfrican-American students\u2014were held in violation of the\nConstitution in 1994, the house of cards forming university\naffirmative action began to\n fall.[18]\n In 1996, the Court of Appeals for\nthe Fifth Circuit struck down the University of Texas Law School\u2019s two-track\nadmissions program.\n In 1998, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit struck down a Boston plan\nassigning students to selective high schools by\n race.[19]\n In 2001, two more schools saw their admissions programs invalidated\nby federal courts: the University of\n Georgia[20]\n and the University of Michigan Law\n School.[21]\n In many of these cases, educational\ninstitutions were using schemes that made race something very much more than\nJustice Powell\u2019s \u201cplus\u201d\n factor.[22]\n The Fifth Circuit Court\u2019s ruling in the University of Texas case (Hopwood\nv. Texas, 78 F 3d 932 [Fifth Circuit, 1996]) threw a cloud\neven over this small window for affirmative action, boldly asserting\nthat the Bakke holding was now dead as law and that race\ncould not be used at all in admissions.\n\n\nGiven Justice Powell\u2019s singular opinion, supported by no one else on\nthe Court, and given the drift of Supreme Court decisions on racial\npreferences since\n 1978,[23]\n the Hopwood court was not\noutlandish, if a bit presumptuous, in declaring Powell\u2019s holding in\nBakke dead. As it happened, Powell\u2019s opinion was far from dead.\nIn the University of Michigan Law School case, Grutter v.\nBollinger, eventually decided by the Supreme Court in June 2003,\nJustice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s lead opinion declared: \u201ctoday we\nendorse Justice Powell\u2019s view that student body diversity is a\ncompelling state interest that can justify the use of race in\nuniversity admissions\u201d (Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 306 [2003], at 330).  Diversity was alive after all. But how it\nworked its affirmative action elixir remained as unclear in 2003 as it\nhad been in 1978.\n\n\nTo see why, consider how in Grutter Justice\nO\u2019Connor posed the issue:\n\n\nThe [Law School\u2019s] policy aspires to \u201cachieve that\ndiversity which has the potential to enrich everyone\u2019s education\nand thus make a law class stronger than the sum of its\nparts.\u201d\u2026The policy does not restrict the types of\ndiversity contributions eligible for substantial weight in the\nadmissions process, but instead recognizes \u201cmany possible bases\nfor diversity admissions.\u201d\u2026The policy does, however,\nreaffirm the Law School\u2019s longstanding commitment to \u201cone\nparticular type of diversity,\u201d that is, \u201cracial and ethnic\ndiversity with special reference to the inclusion of students from\ngroups which have been historically discriminated against\u201d\n(Grutter, at 325).\n\n\n\n\nNow, posing the issue this way and allowing the Law School to assert a\nspecial interest in \u201cone particular type of diversity\u201d\ninvites the conflation of general diversity\u2014a diversity\nof opinions, experiences, backgrounds, talents, aspirations, and\nperspectives\u2014with ethnic and racial diversity\nthat Justice Powell appeared strongly to resist. After all, the\nMedical School too had asserted in its defense a similar special\ninterest.\n\n\nRecall Justice Powell\u2019s principal objection to the Medical School\u2019s\nset-asides. In making the race or ethnicity of an applicant a\n\u201cplus,\u201d a scheme like Harvard\u2019s does\n\n\nnot insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates\nfor the available seats. The file of a particular African-American\napplicant may be examined for his potential contribution to diversity\nwithout the factor of race being decisive when compared, for example,\nwith that of an applicant identified as an Italian-American if the\nlatter is thought to exhibit qualities more likely to promote\nbeneficial educational pluralism.\u2026In short, an admissions\nprogram operated in this way is flexible enough to consider all\npertinent elements of diversity in light of the particular\nqualifications of each applicant\u2026. This kind of program treats\neach applicant as an individual in the admissions\n process (Bakke, at 318\u201319).\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, Allan Bakke was not able to compete for all one hundred\nseats at the Medical School; sixteen were reserved for candidates not\nlike him.\n\n\nIt is Powell\u2019s resistance to this reservation that underpins Justice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion in Grutter, where she observed:\n\n\nWe find that the Law School\u2019s admissions program bears the hallmark\nof a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in\nBakke, truly individualized consideration demands that race be\nused in a flexible, non-mechanical way. It follows from this mandate\nthat universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial\n groups (Grutter, at 337).\n\n\n\n\nWhat vindicated the Law School in O\u2019Connor\u2019s eyes was its\n\u201chighly individualized, holistic review of each applicant\u2019s file,\ngiving serious consideration to all the ways an applicant might\ncontribute to a diverse educational\nenvironment\u201d (Grutter, at\n 339).[24]\n This \u201cindividualized consideration\u201d is crucial; in\nGratz v.  Bollinger, decided the same day as\nGrutter, Justice O\u2019Connor switched sides to hold\nunconstitutional the undergraduate admissions process at the\nUniversity of Michigan. The undergraduate admissions office operated\ndifferently than the Law School. It computed an index score for each\napplicant by assigning numerical points for academic factors such as\nhigh school grades, admissions test scores, quality of high school,\nstrength of curriculum; and for nonacademic factors such as being a\nresident of Michigan, a child of an alumnus, a recruited athlete, or a\nmember of \u201can underrepresented minority group.\u201d An\napplicant falling in this last category automatically received 20\n points (Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 244 [2003], at 287).\n In O\u2019Connor\u2019s view, this \u201cmechanical\u201d procedure meant\nthat the undergraduate admissions office did not fully take account in\neach application \u201cof all factors that may contribute to student\nbody\n diversity\u201d (Gratz, at 288).\n \n\n\nBut O\u2019Connor\u2019s conclusion here simply draws us back to the lacuna in\nJustice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion. Why should the undergraduate\nadmissions office take account of all the factors that may\ncontribute to student body diversity if it especially wants to select\nfrom certain parts of the diversity spectrum? Why can\u2019t it, like the\nLaw School, claim a special interest in \u201cone particular type of\ndiversity\u201d? Why bar the undergraduate admissions office from\nusing an effective tool to promote its interest even if the tool is\n\u201cmechanical\u201d? In fact, the Law School\u2019s\n\u201cnon-mechanical\u201d procedure differed from the undergraduate\nadmissions policy only on its face, not in its results. During\nadmissions season, the Law School\u2019s director of admissions frequently\nconsulted the \u201cdaily reports\u201d that \u201ckept track of\nthe racial and ethnic composition\u201d of the incoming class. He did\nso to make sure a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students was\n included (Grutter, at 326).\n In short, the Law School\n\u201cmanaged\u201d its admissions process so that roughly 6 to 7\npercent of each entering class was African-American. The undergraduate\nadmissions procedure, with its index scores, yielded a similar\n outcome (Grutter, at 367\u201369 [Rehnquist, dissenting] and 374 [Kennedy,\ndissenting]).\n Only surface appearance distinguished the\ntwo procedures. Justice Scalia called\nthe Law School\u2019s \u201cholistic\u201d admissions process \u201ca\nsham,\u201d and not without\n reason (Grutter, at 375 [Scalia, dissenting]).\n\n\nAs it turned out, Grutter failed to close the book on\nuniversity affirmative action. A new legal challenge soon arose, this\ntime against the University of Texas, which had revised its own\nadmission program in 2004 to emulate the scheme validated\nin Grutter. The case, Fisher v. Texas, wound its way\nthrough the courts for a decade, twice landing on the steps of the\nSupreme Court before final disposition in 2016.\n\nJustice Kennedy, writing for the Court, left the Grutter\ndefense of racial preferences intact, essentially retracing Justice\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion. Universities bent upon pursuing the\n\u201ceducational benefits that flow from student body\ndiversity,\u201d he wrote, are due a degree of judicial deference\n(Fisher v. University of Texas, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2419\n[2013]).\n\n\nThe University explains that it strives to provide an \u2018academic\nenvironment\u2019 that offers a \u2018robust exchange of ideas,\nexposure to differing cultures, preparation for the challenges of an\nincreasingly diverse workforce, and acquisition of competencies\nrequired of future leaders.\u2019 \u2026 All of these\nobjectives \u2026 mirror the \u2018compelling interest\u2019 this\nCourt has approved in its prior cases (Fisher v. University of\nTexas, 136 S. Ct. 2198, 2211 [2016]).\n\n\n\nPersuaded that race\u2013neutral policies didn\u2019t allow the\nUniversity fully to succeed in deriving the \u201ceducational\nbenefits\u201d of diversity, the Court majority found the\nUniversity\u2019s modest use of race permissible. \n\n\nBut despite these legal victories, have universities actually made a\ncase for diversity as the justifying basis for race\u2013conscious\nadmissions? Caught napping in the mid\u20131990s when the legal\nchallenges began, higher education rushed to put meat on\nthe Bakke bones and turn Justice Powell\u2019s\noff\u2013hand remarks into a full\u2013fledged defense. As the\nUniversity of Michigan cases approached a final test in 2003, the\nSupreme Court was bombarded with scores of\nfriend\u2013of\u2013the\u2013court briefs from business groups,\nmilitary officers, higher education associations, coteries of\nscholars, and other interested parties lauding the benefits of\ndiversity. A similar outpouring preceded the two decisions\nin Fisher v. University of\nTexas.[25]\n\nConsider some of the claims in these briefs. \u201c[S]tudent body\ndiversity is essential\u201d if universities are to provide\nstudents with \u201cskills necessary for\u2026success in an\nincreasingly globalized world\u201d (Leading Public Research\nUniversities 2015, 11\u201312; emphasis added). Racial and ethnic\ndiversity on campus are vital to securing a capable\nworkforce; it is  essential that [students] be educated in an\nenvironment where they are exposed to diverse people, ideas,\nperspectives, and interactions (65 Leading American Businesses 2003,\n1, 2; emphasis added). Otherwise, the education of students is\n\u201cdegraded\u201d (823 Social Scientists 2015, 5;\nemphasis added). \u201c[S]tudents today must receive direct\nexperience with people of different backgrounds\u201d (American\nCouncil on Education 2015, 6; emphasis added). The\n\u201conly means of obtaining properly qualified employees\nis through diversity at institutions of higher\neducation\u2026[Appropriate] skills can only be developed\nthrough exposure to widely diverse people, culture, ideas, and\nviewpoints\u201d (Fortune 100 and Other Leading Businesses 2013, 3,\n5; emphasis added). \u201cDiversity is an indispensable\nprerequisite to establishing the most productive problem\u2013solving\ngroups\u201d (Social and Organizational Psychologists 2015, 47;\nemphasis added).\n\n\nAccording to the briefs the positive effects of diversity are\nbountiful. They include \u201cimprovements in cognitive abilities,\nanalytical problem solving skills and complex thinking\nskills\u2026[C]ross racial interactions are more strongly linked\nwith cognitive growth than are interactions with non\u2013racial\ndiversity\u201d (American Educational Research Association 2012,\n12). \u201c[R]esearch shows that by increasing diversity, universities can\nhelp their graduates enter society with better problem\u2013solving\ncapabilities than students who are not exposed to diversity\u201d (Social\nand Organizational Psychologists 2015, 37). \n\nNow consider four points. First, the promiscuous use of \u201cdiversity\u201d in\nthe argument for affirmative action opens the door to waffling and\nequivocation. Students learn through \u201cexposure to widely diverse\npeople, culture, ideas, and viewpoints\u201d announces the Fortune 100\nbrief. Of course. But the issue at hand is racial\ndiversity. Wrapping the latter into the former is not an aid to\nprecision.[26]\nSecond, can we imagine that the University of Michigan or the\nUniversity of Texas would abandon its affirmative action program if\nstudies showed no particular educational benefit to diversity? Suppose\nit turns out that students in general don\u2019t show additional \u201ccognitive\ngrowth\u201d from increased racial diversity. Suppose it turns out students\nwould best prepare for our \u201cincreasingly globalized world\u201d by learning\nMandarin Chinese or Spanish.\n\nThird, the straining by academics to show that cross-racial\ninteraction\nis essential, indispensable, vital, necessary,\nor imperative to a good education, if taken at face value,\nleads to an unpleasant conclusion, namely that a lot of black college\nstudents suffer a deficient education. The young woman who excels at\nDunbar High School in Washington, DC (enrollment 95 % black, 1 %\nwhite) and then gets her Bachelor of Science degree in\nstatistics magna cum laude at Spelman College (enrolling, in\n2017, one white among its 2097 students) is, according to Fortune 100\ncompanies, not the sort of employee they want. Graduates of Fisk\nUniversity (0.7% white) or Tougaloo (0.6% white) or Florida A & M\n(3.5% white) haven\u2019t achieved enough cognitive growth,\nhaven\u2019t sufficiently honed their problem\u2013solving\nskills\u2014is that what we are supposed to conclude? The University\nof Texas (enrolling 25% Hispanics and 5% blacks) contends that without\na \u201ccritical mass\u201d of minority students it can\u2019t reap\n\u201cthe educational benefits of diversity.\u201d Does this mean\nthat Prairie View University, two hours down the road from Austin and\nenrolling 7% Hispanics and 1.8% whites, has to do without those\nbenefits? Are its students poorly prepared for \u201cour increasingly\ndiverse workforce and society\u201d (Fisher 2016, at 2210,\n2211)? Defenders of affirmative action should think twice about\nclaiming an education in a \u201cnon\u2013diverse\u201d setting\nmust be degraded. \n\nFourth, there is a noticeable lack of \u201cfit\u201d between university\naffirmative action practices and the diversity rationale (see, for\nexample, Anderson 2002, 27; Anderson 2004, 1217, 1221; Anderson 2010,\n142\u2013143). Race is not treated just like any other special factor\nthat might warrant an admission \u201cplus.\u201d Universities work diligently\nto maintain a relatively constant percentage of black and Hispanic\nenrollees but give variable attention to other of the myriad qualities\nstudents can bring to campus. As one proponent of affirmative action\nnotes, \u201caffirmative action programs\u2026do not look or operate as\nif they were testing for \u2018diversity\u2019.\u201d He suggests that many\nsupporters of affirmative action nevertheless disregard this fact,\nbelieving \u201cthat there is no harm in [a] miscast reliance on diversity\nbecause, with a wink and a nod, everyone understands that diversity is\nreally a proxy for integration\u201d (Issacharoff 2002, 30, 34;\nemphasis added). \n",
