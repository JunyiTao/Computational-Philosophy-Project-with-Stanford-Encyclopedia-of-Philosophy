Ontology (before 1324): essences and substantial forms\n\nGenerally speaking, for a medieval realist the essence of a thing is\nthe main metaphysical component of that thing, namely that in virtue\nof which that thing is something of a certain kind: a human, a cat, or\na stone. Therefore, essences are connected with being taken only in\nthe sense of that which is real, that is to say, actually existing.\nSince being taken in this sense is divided into the ten categories and\nis absolutely and primarily said of substances and only secondarily of\naccidents, essences were usually viewed as something (1) common to a\nmultiplicity of items in virtue of which these various items belong to\ntheir species and genera, as humanity is the essence of humans; and\n(2) present primarily and properly in substances, but in accidents\nsecondarily and derivatively.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the debate on essence was\nfocused on the relation between substantial essence (the so called\n\u2018forma totius\u2019, e.g., humanity) and the singular\nsubstantial form which, together with the singular matter, brings the\nsubstantial composite about (the so-called \u2018forma\npartis\u2019, e.g., human souls, which in union with human bodies\ngive rise to human beings). Medieval authors disputed a lot about\nwhether or not the essence (the forma totius) of a thing had\nto be somehow identified with the singular substantial form (the\nforma partis). Following Averroes\u2019 commentary on the\nMetaphysics (book VII, t.c. 34), some authors maintained that\nit was so. Others, such as Thomas Aquinas (Summa theologiae,\nI, q. 75, a. 4), supported the thesis that the substantial essence of\na thing and its singular form are somehow distinct entities, since the\nessence includes the common matter of the species, namely the material\nproper to all the members of the species connected with the essence\n(flesh and bones for human beings).\n\nBurley deals with these topics for the first time in his juvenile\nmiddle commentary on the Categories and Tractatus de\nabstractis (still unedited). In former work, he claims that\nsubstantial essences have no being (esse) outside the being\nof their instantiations (TsP, ch.\u00a0de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 34\u201335). Individual substances are unique metaphysical\nentities, located at a particular place and time, and substantial\nessences are their specific forms, apt to be common to several\nsingulars at the same time, present in them, and having no independent\nexistence. An individual substance, such as the substance of Socrates,\nis compounded not only by singular form and matter, but also by any\nsubstantial essence which is over-ordered to the singular substance\nand therefore predicated in quid of it. Furthermore, in his\nopinion, singular substances can be acknowledged as members of a given\n(natural) species by virtue of their conformity to the abstract\nessence they instantiate (TsP, ch.\u00a0de substantia,\ned. Conti, pp. 36\u201337; see also pp. 32\u201333). \n\nIn both the treatises, Burley follows Averroes in solving the question\nof the relationship between the essence as forma totius (in\nhuman beings, the humanity) and the forma partis (in human\nbeings, the soul). In his opinion, the forma totius of a\nthing is the same entity as the forma partis of that thing.\nBut we can refer to this entity by means of two different concepts,\ndepending on two different points of view. So according to him, the\nnoun \u2018humanity\u2019 and the expression \u2018intellective soul\u2019 have\nthe same reference, but different senses. \u2018Humanity\u2019 means the\nintellective soul considered as completing and perfecting a certain\nkind of body, and not by itself, as such and such an entity. On the\ncontrary, \u2018intellective soul\u2019 does refer to the intellective soul\ninsofar as it is such and such an entity, and not insofar as it is the\nentity complementing such and such a body. Hence \u2018humanity\u2019 is\nequivalent to the expression \u2018intellective soul informing a body\u2019\n(Tractatus de abstractis, Vatican City, Bibliotheca\nApostolica Vaticana, Vat. Lat. 2146, fol. 249rb). In this way, through\nthe reference to body, Burley tried to preserve Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\nidea (De ente et essentia, ch. 2) that the definition of the\nessence of a thing must contain not only its form, but its matter as\nwell. \n\nBurley argues that if the forma totius were a distinct entity\nin relation to the forma partis, then these two clearly\nunacceptable consequences would follow: firstly, a whole thing\n(totum) would be part of itself; secondly, there would be an\ninfinite regress of formae totius for each and every singular\nsubstance in the world (Tractatus de abstractis, fol.\n249rb).\n\nThis view had been already supported in the Tractatus super librum\nPredicamentorum, where, in commenting on the third chapter of the\nCategories, Burley had also pointed out that the body which\nis traditionally seen as a part of the human composite is an aggregate\n(aggregatum) of prime matter and the general form of\nquantity, and therefore not properly speaking part of the substance.\nRather, it is part of the macro-object (obiectum sensus),\nnamely the whole aggregate compounded by the substance and all of its\naccidental forms (TsP, ch.\u00a0de regulis\npraedicationis, ed. Conti, p. 24). On the contrary, those authors\nwho admit a plurality of substantial forms in the primary substance\nmust concede that the body which is part of the substance is a\ncomposite (compositum) of prime matter and the imperfect\nsubstantial form of corporeity (corporeitas; see\nTsP, ch.\u00a0de regulis praedicationis, ed. Conti, pp.\n24\u201325).\n\nThe same ideas concerning forma partis and forma\ntotius are restated in the first part of the later Tractatus\nde formis, where Burley continously identifies the human form\nwith the intellective soul (pp. 9, 10, and 15). In this work, he deals\nwith the nature and ontological status of prime matter and the\ndistinction between substantial and accidental forms. The thesis of\nthe real distinction between the essence and its individuals is not\nyet supported, and Averroes\u2019s influence is still heavy. Burley\ndefines substantial forms as those forms which immediately perfect\nmatter and give existence (esse simpliciter) to the\ncomposite, whereas accidental forms presuppose the existence of the\ncomposite, and perfect it. As a result, individuals belonging to the\nsame natural species differ from each other because of their own\nmatter, substantial form (or essence), and accidental forms (p.\n9).\n\nWhat characterizes Burley\u2019s opinion on essence in the period 1300\u201323\nseems to be the acceptance of the Averroistic thesis of the\nidentification of the forma totius with the forma\npartis. It is evident that in the human composite the essence is\nnothing but the intellective soul which informs the body. This choice\nallows Burley to justify the interpretation of the relation between\npredicate and subject of an essential predication in terms of\nidentity, and gives him a strong criterion for distinguishing\nsubstantial from accidental forms. Furthermore, it also allows him to\nhave an ontology rather lacking in kinds of entities: he admits the\nextramental existence of secondary substances, and so the extramental\nexistence of substantial essences, but even if they are real from a\ncertain point of view, absolutely considered (namely, from the point\nof view of their being) such essences have to be identified with the\nsubstantial forms which constitute the substantial composites. As a\nconsequence, the macro-objects (or obiecta sensus) are\naggregates made up by singular matter and (substantial) form and a\ncongeries of singular accidental forms inhering in the composite of\nmatter and form -- a description of the (metaphysical) structure of\nthings with which even a nominalist could have agreed. Yet, for\nBurley, the substantial form displays and transmits to the composite\nits own genetic inheritance (so to speak), namely the string of (real)\nproperties (the specific differences) which give rise to that\nsubstantial form from the generic and simple property of\nbeing-a-substance. And so, if considered from the point of view of its\n\u201cgenetic inheritance\u201d, the form is the essence, or forma\ntotius, of the composite, and, as such, somehow differs from\nitself viewed as forma partis of the composite. \n",
