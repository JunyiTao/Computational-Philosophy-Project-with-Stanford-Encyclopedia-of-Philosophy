The Meaning of Philosophy and Phenomenology\n\nAt the end of his life, Scheler wrote that the central issue in his\nthought and writing was the question regarding the meaning of the\nhuman being (GW IX, 9). This question not only guided his ever\nexpanding philosophical endeavors, but also defined his approach and\nunderstanding of philosophy. Like many of the Lebensphilosophen\n(philosophers of life) who had influenced him, Scheler strove to save\nphilosophy and thought from the reductive mindset of the positive\nsciences and to a degree, American pragmatism, a mindset that defined\nthe human being as mere homo faber (tool-maker). The human\nbeing is without a doubt a practical being, seeking to master and\nmanipulate his or her environment to achieve desired results and avoid\nfuture suffering. For Scheler, practical knowledge and practical\nconsciousness are genetically the first form of knowledge for the\nindividual. Yet, human beings are not necessarily tied to practical\naffairs and have the ability to comprehend and regard the world in\nterms of its essence or being. Philosophy, for Scheler, is the\n\u201cloving act of participation by the core of the human being\nin the essence of all things\u201d (GW V, 68). Practical\nknowledge is only the first of three types of knowledge. In addition\nto practical or mastery knowledge, Scheler describes two other types,\nerudition (Bildungswissen) and knowledge of revelation. All\nthree types have their own integrity and are irreducible to one\nanother. Each knowledge types thus has its own origin and is motivated\nby a different feeling. While practical knowledge is motivated by\nphysical pain or fear of error, erudition is motivated by wonder and\nknowledge of revelation by awe. Philosophical knowledge belongs to the\ntype, erudition.\n\nWonder is a loving concern for the world as it is in itself and marks\nthe transition from the practical to the philosophical (GW VIII, 208).\nThis \u201cloving participation\u201d of philosophy is, however,\ndistinct from the classical notion of love (eros) as a lack. Love is\nunderstood by Scheler here in terms of the Christian sense of\nagape, loving as giving. The human being as a loving,\nphilosophical being is not motivated to know by a sense of a lack, as\nis the case with eros, but is rather motivated by the abundance and\nsurfeit of the meaning of the world (GW VI, 84). Modernity\u2019s\nethos of control and domination has transformed the world into a mere\nobject of utility. As a means to reawaken a sense of wonder, Scheler\ncalled for a rehabilitation of virtue, in particular the virtues of\nhumility and reverence (GW III, 15). The philosopher lives in\nreverence of the world, in astonishment of the world\u2019s\ninexhaustible depth and secrets (GW III, 26).\n\nPhilosophical thought attends to the core meaning of knowledge as a\nSeinsverh\u00e4ltnis, an ontological relation. Knowledge,\naccording to Scheler, is a relation between beings, a relation wherein\na being \u2018participates\u2019 in what another being is in itself\n(GW VIII, 203). Scheler rejects the idea that knowledge is a an act of\nconstruction, as was the case for the neo-Kantians such as Ernst\nCassirer. Rather knowledge is a form of discovery, a discovery that\nrequires a humble divesting of oneself that opens one up to the other\n(GW VIII, 204) and presupposes the loving willingness to be open to\nthat which is other.\n\nFollowing Augustine, Scheler takes the emotional and affective life as\nfoundational for any form of knowledge (GW VI, 87). Before the world\nis known, it is first given. Love is that which opens the human being\nup to the world, to that which is other. This openness demonstrates\nthat there is a moral precondition for knowledge. Knowledge is\npossible only for a loving being (GW V, 83). This love is the movement\nof transcendence, a going beyond oneself, an opening to ever richer\nmeaning. Love is always already directed to the infinite, to absolute\nvalue and being (GW V, 90). With this understanding of the relation of\nlove to knowledge, Scheler declares that \u201cknowledge is\nultimately from the divine and for the divine\u201d (GW VIII,\n211).\n\nIt was not until he read Husserl\u2019s Logical\nInvestigations and learned of the idea of phenomenology, however,\nthat Scheler came upon a style of thinking that best captured for him\nthe loving disposition of philosophy. Although he was greatly indebted\nto Husserl\u2019s genius and originality, Scheler was often critical\nof Husserl when describing the nature of phenomenology. For Scheler,\nphenomenology is unequivocally not a method, but an attitude (GW X,\n380). Grasping the meaning or essence of an object has meant, since\nPlato, a type of disengagement from or suspension of an object\u2019s\nimmediate and present existence. The intent of this disengagement is\nnot to abstract from an object of cognition as it exists, but rather\nto look at the object as it is itself. The natural worldview or\nattitude presupposes the practical and habitual context in which the\nobject is given and thus uncritically assumes the meaning of the\nobject in this context. The scientific worldview assumes a particular\nunderstanding of the natural world in its investigations and\ndetermination of meaning, an atomistic or mechanistic conception of a\nliving being. In both cases, there is no reflection regarding the\nmeaning presupposed in the intention. The phenomenological attitude\ndoes not negate the practical or scientific world and way of being. It\nmerely holds them in abeyance, suspending judgment. Such a suspension\nis motivated not by a disdain or a devaluation of the practical life,\nbut by a love of the world. It is in this respect that Scheler\ndescribes phenomenological attitude as a psychic technique comparable\nto Buddhist techniques of suffering (GW VIII, 139).\n\nScheler shares the conviction with realist phenomenologists such as\nAdolf Reinach that there are essential intuitions\n(Wesensanschauungen) or essential insights\n(Wesenseinsichten) (GW X, 383), in which we have intuitive\nand immediate graspings of the essence of the being of the objects.\nThis grasping of the object is never complete and assumes merely a\npartial insight into the thing itself (GW V, 199). Modernity, for\nScheler, suffers from a fundamental mistrust of the world, a mistrust\nthat the world given in experience is not the world itself, but rather\nsome construct produced by the human mind. Phenomenology assumes a\ntrust in the world and in experience. It is the world that gives\nitself to intuition, beckoning us to participate ever more fully in\nits significance. By virtue of this loving trust, the world itself is\ngiven. The phenomenological attitude is an expression on this trust\nand seeks to describe the object as it gives itself, as it is brought\nto self-givenness. \n",
