    "main_text": "Epistemology: The Cognitive Functions of Models || Learning about models\n3.1 Learning about models\n\nLearning about a model happens in two places: in the construction of\nthe model and in its manipulation (Morgan 1999). There are no fixed\nrules or recipes for model building and so the very activity of\nfiguring out what fits together, and how, affords an opportunity to\nlearn about the model. Once the model is built, we do not learn about\nits properties by looking at it; we have to use and manipulate the\nmodel in order to elicit its secrets.\n\nDepending on what kind of model we are dealing with, building and\nmanipulating a model amount to different activities demanding\ndifferent methodologies. Material models seem to be straightforward\nbecause they are used in common experimental contexts (e.g., we put\nthe model of a car in the wind tunnel and measure its air resistance).\nHence, as far as learning about the model is concerned, material\nmodels do not give rise to questions that go beyond questions\nconcerning experimentation more generally.\n\nNot so with fictional and abstract models. What constraints are there\nto the construction of fictional and abstract models, and how do we\nmanipulate them? A natural response seems to be that we do this by\nperforming a thought experiment. Different authors (e.g., Brown 1991;\nGendler 2000; Norton 1991; Reiss 2003; Sorensen 1992) have explored\nthis line of argument, but they have reached very different and often\nconflicting conclusions about how thought experiments are performed\nand what the status of their outcomes is (for details, see the entry\non\n thought experiments).\n\nAn important class of models is computational in nature. For some\nmodels it is possible to derive results or solve equations of a\nmathematical model analytically. But quite often this is not the case.\nIt is at this point that computers have a great impact, because they\nallow us to solve problems that are otherwise intractable. Hence,\ncomputational methods provide us with knowledge about (the\nconsequences of) a model where analytical methods remain silent. Many\nparts of current research in both the natural and social sciences rely\non computer simulations, which help scientists to explore the\nconsequences of models that cannot be investigated otherwise. The\nformation and development of stars and galaxies, the dynamics of\nhigh-energy heavy-ion reactions, the evolution of life, outbreaks of\nwars, the progression of an economy, moral behavior, and the\nconsequences of decision procedures in an organization are explored\nwith computer simulations, to mention only a few examples.\n\nComputer simulations are also heuristically important. They can\nsuggest new theories, models, and hypotheses, for example, based on a\nsystematic exploration of a model\u2019s parameter space (Hartmann\n1996). But computer simulations also bear methodological perils. For\nexample, they may provide misleading results because, due to the\ndiscrete nature of the calculations carried out on a digital computer,\nthey only allow for the exploration of a part of the full parameter\nspace, and this subspace need not reflect every important feature of\nthe model. The severity of this problem is somewhat mitigated by the\nincreasing power of modern computers. But the availability of more\ncomputational power can also have adverse effects: it may encourage\nscientists to swiftly come up with increasingly complex but\nconceptually premature models, involving poorly understood assumptions\nor mechanisms and too many additional adjustable parameters (for a\ndiscussion of a related problem in the social sciences, see Braun and\nSaam 2015: Ch.\u00a03). This can lead to an increase in empirical\nadequacy\u2014which may be welcome for certain forecasting\ntasks\u2014but not necessarily to a better understanding of the\nunderlying mechanisms. As a result, the use of computer simulations\ncan change the weight we assign to the various goals of science.\nFinally, the availability of computer power may seduce scientists into\nmaking calculations that do not have the degree of trustworthiness one\nwould expect them to have. This happens, for instance, when computers\nare used to propagate probability distributions forward in time, which\ncan turn out to be misleading (see Frigg et al. 2014). So it is\nimportant not to be carried away by the means that new powerful\ncomputers offer and lose sight of the actual goals of research. For a\ndiscussion of further issues in connection with computer simulations,\nwe refer the reader to the entry on\n computer simulations in science.\n",
