Data protection laws,\nregulation and governance aim at establishing fair conditions for\ndrafting contracts about personal data transmission and exchange and\nproviding data subjects with checks and balances, guarantees for\nredress and means to monitor compliance with the terms of the\ncontract. Flexible pricing, price targeting and price gauging, dynamic\nnegotiations are typically undertaken on the basis of asymmetrical\ninformation and great disparities in access to information. Also\nchoice modelling in marketing, micro-targeting in political campaigns,\nand nudging in policy implementation exploit a basic informational\ninequality of principal and agent.\nInformational injustice and discrimination: Personal information\nprovided in one sphere or context (for example, health care) may\nchange its meaning when used in another sphere or context (such as\ncommercial transactions) and may lead to discrimination and\ndisadvantages for the individual. This is related to the discussion on\ncontextual integrity by Nissenbaum (2004) and Walzerian spheres of\njustice (Van den Hoven 2008).\nEncroachment on moral autonomy and human dignity: Lack of privacy\nmay expose individuals to outside forces that influence their choices\nand bring them to make decisions they would not have otherwise made.\nMass surveillance leads to a situation where routinely, systematically,\nand continuously individuals make choices and decisions because they\nknow others are watching them. This affects their status as autonomous\nbeings and has what sometimes is described as a \u201cchilling effect\u201d\non them and on society. Closely related are considerations of\nviolations of respect for persons and human dignity. The massive\naccumulation of data relevant to a person\u2018s identity (e.g. brain-computer interfaces, identity graphs, digital doubles or digital twins, analysis\nof the topology of one\u2018s social networks) may give rise to the idea\nthat we know a particular person since there is so much information about\nher. It can be argued that being able to figure people out on the\nbasis of their big data constitutes an epistemic and moral immodesty\n(Bruynseels & Van den Hoven 2015), which fails to respect the fact\nthat human beings are subjects with private mental states that have a\ncertain quality that is inaccessible from an external perspective\n(third or second person perspective) \u2013 however detailed and accurate\nthat may be. Respecting privacy would then imply a recognition of this\nmoral phenomenology of human persons, i.e. recognising that a human\nbeing is always more than advanced digital technologies can\ndeliver.\n\n\nThese considerations all provide good moral reasons for limiting and\nconstraining access to personal data and providing individuals with\ncontrol over their data.\n",
