    "main_text": "Nutrition\n5. Nutrition\n\n\nWhen turning to these individual faculties of the soul, Aristotle\nconsiders nutrition first, for two related reasons. The first is\nstraightforward: psychology considers all animate entities, and the\nnutritive soul belongs to all naturally living things, since it is\n\u201cthe first and most common capacity of soul, in virtue of which\nlife belongs to all living things\u201d (De Anima ii 4,\n415a24\u201325). The second is slightly more complex, being at root\nteleological. Given that the higher forms of soul presuppose nutrition,\nits explication is prior to them in the order of Aristotle\u2019s\nexposition.\n\n\nAristotle approaches his account of the nutritive soul by relying on\na methodological precept which informs much of his psychological\ntheorizing, namely that a capacity is individuated by its objects, so\nthat, e.g., perception is distinguished from mind by being arrayed\ntoward sensible qualities rather than intelligible forms (De\nAnima ii 4, 415a20\u201321). This induces him to offer what may sound\ninitially like a pedestrian observation, that in nutrition there are\nthree components, \u201cthat which is nourished, that by which it is\nnourished, and what nourishes (i.e. that which engages in\nnutrition).\u201d This, however, Aristotle unpacks by maintaining that\n\u201cwhat nourishes is the primary soul; what is nourished is the\nbody which has this soul; and that by which it is nourished is\nnourishment (i.e. food)\u201d (De Anima ii 4, 416b20\u201323). The\ninterest of this suggestion lies in the implication that all and only\nliving systems can be nourished, a consequence Aristotle makes more\nexplicit by claiming that \u201cnothing is nourished which does not\nhave a share in life\u201d (De Anima ii 4. 415b27\u201328) and\nthat \u201csince nothing is nourished which does not partake of life,\nwhat is nourished will be the ensouled body insofar as it is ensouled,\nwith the result that nourishment (i.e. food) is related to the\nensouled, and not coincidentally\u201d (De Anima ii 4,\n416b9\u201311). Here Aristotle means that food, as food, is definitionally\nrelated to life. Whatever is food is already such as to be necessarily\nrelated to living beings.\n\n\nThe significance of this observation resides in the thought that any\nadequate account of nutrition will make ineliminable reference to life\nas such. This in turn entails that it will not be possible to\ndefine life as the capacity for taking on nutrition. For then\nwe would have a vicious circularity: a living system is the sort of\nthing which can take on nutrition, while nutrition is whatever stuff is\nsuch as to sustain a living system. So, if living systems cannot be\nreductively defined in some other way, it will follow that no reductive\naccount of life will be forthcoming. Consequently, Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of nutrition provides some reason for thinking that he will\nresist any attempt to define life in terms which do not themselves\nimplicitly appeal to life itself. That is, he will resist any reductive\naccount of life.\n\n\nThis also seems to be the purport of Aristotle\u2019s rejection of the\nsimple mechanistic accounts of growth which he considers when\ndiscussing the nutritive soul (De Anima ii 4, 415b27\u2013416a20;\ncf. De Generatione et Corruptione i 5). Aristotle objects to\nthose who want to account for growth merely in terms of the natural\ntendencies of material elements. For growth is a constrained\npattern of development, the source of which Aristotle ascribes to the\nsoul. He takes it as evident that growth in organisms proceeds along\nstructured paths, in end-directed ways. These structures in turn\nmanifest capacities whose explication cannot be given in crude\nmaterialistic terms; for materialistic terms, as Aristotle understands\nthem, fail to account for the fact that mature members of species cease\ngrowing, having realized the structures characteristic of their kind.\nFire, for example, by contrast \u201cgrows\u201d haphazardly, without\ndirectionality, flowing towards the combustible without end, until\nhindered by external impediments or lack of fuel.\n\n\nNow, the forms of materialist explanations Aristotle considers are\nprimitive. One critical question about his treatment of these\nexplanations concerns whether he is right to suggest that facts about\nconstrained patterns of development are incompatible with more\nexplanatorily advanced forms of materialism, and, if so, whether those\nforms of materialism will be reductive in the sense that they will\navoid all implicit or explicit reference to life. So far, there is\nlittle reason to think that Aristotle has been proven wrong; that is,\nthere is at present no reductive account of life which enjoys universal\nor even broad support.\n\n\nIn any case, Aristotle\u2019s discussion of nutrition is characteristic\nof his general approach to the soul\u2019s faculties. His discussions often\nproceed on two levels. On the one hand, he simply seeks to provide an\naccount of the relevant phenomena. At the same time, his interests in\ndefinition are conditioned by a host of broader methodological and\nmetaphysical concerns. Consequently, he attempts to capture the nature\nof the individual faculties while at the same time investigating\nwhether reductive accounts of them are plausible. In this way, at\nleast, Aristotle\u2019s investigations reflect sensitivity to an array of\ninterlocking questions in definitional methodology, including most\nnotably questions about the plausibility of reductive approaches to\nlife\u2019s most characteristic features. These same interests are apparent\nin his discussions of perception and mind.\n",
