    "main_text": "Theory of History || Rationality\n3.5 Rationality\n\nThe driving force of history, in Cohen\u2019s reconstruction of Marx,\nis the development of the productive forces, the most important of\nwhich is technology. But what is it that drives such development?\nUltimately, in Cohen\u2019s account, it is human rationality. Human\nbeings have the ingenuity to apply themselves to develop means to\naddress the scarcity they find. This on the face of it seems very\nreasonable. Yet there are difficulties. As Cohen himself acknowledges,\nsocieties do not always do what would be rational for an individual to\ndo. Co-ordination problems may stand in our way, and there may be\nstructural barriers. Furthermore, it is relatively rare for those who\nintroduce new technologies to be motivated by the need to address\nscarcity. Rather, under capitalism, the profit motive is the key. Of\ncourse it might be argued that this is the social form that the\nmaterial need to address scarcity takes under capitalism. But still\none may raise the question whether the need to address scarcity always\nhas the influence that it appears to have taken on in modern times.\nFor example, a ruling class\u2019s absolute determination to hold on\nto power may have led to economically stagnant societies.\nAlternatively, it might be thought that a society may put religion or\nthe protection of traditional ways of life ahead of economic needs.\nThis goes to the heart of Marx\u2019s theory that man is an\nessentially productive being and that the locus of interaction with\nthe world is industry. As Cohen himself later argued in essays such as\n\u201cReconsidering Historical Materialism\u201d (1988), the\nemphasis on production may appear one-sided, and ignore other powerful\nelements in human nature. Such a criticism chimes with a criticism\nfrom the previous section; that the historical record may not, in\nfact, display the tendency to growth in the productive forces assumed\nby the theory.\n",
