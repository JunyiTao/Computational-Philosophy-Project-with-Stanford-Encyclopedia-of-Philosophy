    "main_text": "Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy || Buddhism\n3.3 Buddhism\n\nThe third major fountainhead feeding into Japanese philosophy from\nancient to contemporary times has been Buddhism. With origins in India\ngoing back to the fifth century bce, Buddhist\nphilosophy like Confucianism entered Japan via Korea and China in the\nsixth and seventh centuries. In contrast with Confucianism, however,\nby the end of the eighth century Buddhism emerged as the major focus\nof Japanese creative philosophical development as imported Chinese\nBuddhist schools of thought were modified and new Japanese schools\ndeveloped. Buddhism continued its intellectual dominance until the\nseventeenth century, then making way for the second wave of Confucian\nideas that better suited the newly risen urbanized, secular society\nunder the control of the Tokugawa shoguns. With notable exceptions, in\nthe seventeenth through nineteenth centuries Buddhist intellectuals\nretreated from philosophical innovation to focus on institutional\ndevelopment, textual studies, and sectarian histories. When Western\nphilosophy surged into modern Japan and its newly established secular\nuniversities, some influential Japanese philosophers saw Buddhist\nideas as the best premodern resource for synthesis with Western\nthought. In some cases that entailed reformulating traditional\nBuddhist ideas in light of Western philosophical categories. In other\ncases, philosophers used allocation, relegation, or hybridization to\ncreate new systems that tried to assimilate Western ideas while\nmaintaining aspects of traditional Japanese values. That said, in the\nmodern era under the ideology of State Shint\u014d, Buddhism as both a\nreligion and a philosophy often suffered persecution and it was not\nuntil 1945 that it was once again completely free to develop its\ntheories openly without government surveillance and censorship.\n\nBuddhism and the Self-World Interrelation\n\nBuddhism, with a millennium of philosophical roots going back to India\nand further cultivated in China and Korea, brought to\nProto-Shint\u014d\u2019s vague intuitions and inchoate belief systems\nsophisticated analyses, multiple theoretical formulations and\ncounterarguments represented by a multitude of different schools of\nthought, and a rich new vocabulary redolent with allusions to ideas\nand terms from Sanskrit, Pali, and Chinese. There were, however, a few\nnearly universally accepted Buddhist themes that resonated well with\nthe Japanese preliterate context and have continued to influence major\nlines of Japanese thinking throughout its history\n\nFirst is the Buddhist claim that reality consists of a flow of\ninterdependent, conditioned events rather than independent,\nsubstantially existent things. Nothing exists in and of itself and\nthere is no unchanging reality behind the world of flux. The\nBuddha\u2019s view was formulated originally in opposition to an\nincreasingly orthodox emphasis in Indian philosophy at the time\n(roughly the 5th c. bce)\nthat favored the idea of a permanent reality (Sanskrit:\nbrahman) or Self (\u0101tman) behind a world of\napparent change. Thus, more than a millennium later Buddhism came to\nJapan with fully developed, sophisticated analyses supporting a world\nview that was essentially consistent with proto-Shint\u014d\u2019s\nunreflective emphasis on internal relations, fluid boundaries, and a\nfield of shifting events rather than fixed things. Moreover, within\nthe variety of Buddhist schools introduced into Japan by the eighth\ncentury, there were further resources that could philosophically\njustify and elaborate what had been rather inchoate assumptions of\npre-Buddhist Japan. For example, the Japanese Kegon (Chinese: Huayan)\nschool had a rich philosophy of interdependence based in holographic\nrelations, which had probably been more a magical modality than\nphilosophical idea in the proto-Shint\u014d consciousness. Kegon gave\nit a philosophical articulation and justification.\n\nA second Buddhist premise is that reality presents itself without\nillusion in its so-called as-ness or thusness (nyoze;\nSanskrit: tathat\u0101). That premise contrasts with a\nwidespread orthodox Indian view (found in the Upani\u015bads\nand later Vedas, for example) that reality continuously hides\nits true nature through illusion (Sanskrit: m\u0101y\u0101).\nStill, according to Buddhism, despite the lack of ontological\nillusions, we ordinarily almost never access reality as it is because\nwe project on it psychological delusions fueled by habituated\nstimulus-response systems based in ignorance, repulsion, and desire.\nAs a result, a major theme in Buddhist philosophy is to understand the\nbodymind mechanisms of the inner self or consciousness, to recognize\nhow our emotions, ideas, mental states, and even philosophical\nassumptions color our perceptions of reality. The problem is not\nillusions within reality, but the self-delusions we mistake for\nreality. Buddhism brought to Japan not only an awareness of the inner\ndynamics of experience, but also a collection of epistemological,\npsychological, ethical, hermeneutic, and metaphysical bodymind\ntheories and practices aimed at understanding and eradicating those\ndelusions. Without those delusions our bodymind would be in accord\nwith the way things are and we could live without the anguish created\nby trying to live in a concocted reality we desire instead of reality\nas it is.\n\nA third general Buddhist contribution to Japanese thought since\nancient times is its theory of volitional action or karma\n(g\u014d). Every volitional thought, word, or deed has an\nimpact on the bodymind system such that present actions lead to\npropensities for future actions within that system. Furthermore, karma\nis Janus-headed in its causality such that those present actions are\nalso in part conditioned by previous volitional actions as well. The\nresult is that I affect my surrounding conditions even as those\nsurrounding conditions are affecting me. Thus, the Buddhist theory of\nkarmic action implies a field of interresponsive agency that is\nparadoxically both individuated and systemic, both volitional and\nconditioned. That paradigm has raised a number of issues and generated\nmultiple theories by Japanese Buddhist ethical and social philosophers\nthrough the centuries.\n",
