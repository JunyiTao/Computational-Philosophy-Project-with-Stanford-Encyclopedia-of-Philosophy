    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophers usually acknowledge two individually necessary and\njointly sufficient conditions for a person to be morally responsible\nfor an action, i.e., susceptible to be praised or blamed for it: a\ncontrol condition (also called freedom condition) and an epistemic\ncondition (also called knowledge, cognitive, or mental condition). The\nfirst condition has to do with whether the agent possessed an adequate\ndegree of control or freedom in performing the action, whereas the\nsecond condition is concerned with whether the agent\u2019s epistemic\nor cognitive state was such that she can properly be held accountable\nfor the action and its consequences. While the first condition prompts\nus to ask \u201cwas this person acting freely when she did\nA?\u201d, the second condition prompts us to ask \u201cwas\nthis person aware of what she was doing (of its consequences,\nmoral significance,\n etc.)?\u201d[1]\n\nThe standard assumption used to be that the philosophically\ninteresting condition was the one concerned with freedom and that, in\ncomparison, the epistemic condition (henceforth, EC) was relatively\nstraightforward and unproblematic. However, in the last twenty years\nor so it has become patent that the EC presents certain unique\nchallenges for a correct understanding of moral\nresponsibility\u2014even distinctive skeptical threats to its\npossibility (see sect. 2)\u2014quite independently of the issue of\nfreedom and determinism. The main purposes of this entry are, first,\nto outline in general terms what the EC is\u2014what its requirements\nare and what kinds of awareness are involved (sect. 1)\u2014and,\nsecond, to present the main competing positions concerning the\ninterpretation of those requirements and the different ways of\nsatisfying them (sects. 2\u20133).\n",
