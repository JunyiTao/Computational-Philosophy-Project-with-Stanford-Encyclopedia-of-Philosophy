    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories do not Provide a Metasemantic Theory\n4.8 Causal Theories do not Provide a Metasemantic Theory\n\nIn discussing informational variants of causal theories, Artiga &\nSebasti\u00e1n, 2020, have proposed a new \u201cmetasemantic\u201d\nproblem. They correctly note that there is a difference between\nexplaining why \u201cX\u201d means X, rather than Y, and explaining\nwhy \u201cX\u201d has a meaning at all. Moreover, they correctly\nnote that having an answer to this first question does not necessarily\nanswer the second question. But, it is unclear that the metasemantic\nproblem is serious. If one\u2019s theory is that \u201cX\u201d\nmeans X if A, B, and C, then that would seem to provide an answer to\nthe metasemantic question. Why does \u201cX\u201d mean anything at\nall? Because \u201cX\u201d meets sufficiency conditions A, B, and C.\nIn other words, insofar as there is a question to be answered, it\nappears that all theories provide one.\n",
