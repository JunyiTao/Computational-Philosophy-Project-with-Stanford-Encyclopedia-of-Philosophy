    "main_text": "The Definition of Art\n6. The Definition of Art\n\nAs mentioned above, Beardsley \u201csedulously avoided\u201d\n(Aesth: 59) the term \u201cwork of art\u201d as much as\npossible in Aesthetics. Even so, he came close to defining\nit. \u201cAesthetic object\u201d is his surrogate term, and he does\noffer a schematic definition of it.\n\nThe genus of \u201caesthetic object\u201d is perceptual\nobject. What is its differentia? It\u2019s not, Beardsley\nargues,\n\na motive or intention, even an aesthetic motive or intention, that\nstands behind the creation of the object,\nan effect, even if an aesthetic effect, that the object produces\nin those who experience it, or\nan attitude, even if, again, an aesthetic attitude, that people\nbring to the object.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is\u00a0objective differentia, not subjective ones\nlike (a), (b), and (c). Such differentia could be of either of two\nsorts. First, it could express the characteristics of perceptual\nobjects that all and only aesthetic objects have. This, Beardsley\nthinks, can\u2019t be done until a great deal of knowledge of\naesthetic objects and the philosophy of art is at hand; and it\nisn\u2019t. Second, an objective definition could proceed by first\ndividing up aesthetic objects into classes according to their sensory\nfields\u2014as seen, heard, felt, and so on\u2014and then, within\neach field, determining what objective characteristics distinguish\naesthetic objects from other perceptual objects.\n\nThe second route is the one Beardsley takes in Aesthetics.\nSchematically, an aesthetic object is: a visual perceptual object that\nisn\u2019t in the class of things that plastic forks, crumpled pieces\nof paper, and so on are in; or an auditory perceptual object that\nisn\u2019t in the class of objects that scratches, noises, and so on\nare in; etc. This is more the beginnings of an outline of an approach\nto a definition than the beginnings of a definition\nitself\u2014something Beardsley realizes\u2014and it has problems of\nits own. The interesting question, however, isn\u2019t what those\nproblems are or the ultimate success or failure of this \u201cdivide\nand conquer\u201d approach, but why he adopted it in the first place,\nand why he later abandoned it.\n\nHe adopted it for two reasons. First, approaches of the (a), (b), and\n(c) sort have numerous and serious problems (Aesth:\n60\u201363). Second, if art criticism can amount to knowledge, as\nBeardsley believes it can, then what\u2019s called for is an object\nof study that can be examined in its own right, in respect to its own\nobjective qualities. Both of these factors led him in search of an\nobjective definition of \u201caesthetic object\u201d. Since,\nhowever, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions seemed out of\nthe question\u2014there was too much variety among aesthetic objects,\nand too much disagreement among philosophers\u2014\u201cdivide and\nconquer\u201d seemed a better strategy.\n\nThe reason why he later abandoned it is that he came to realize not\nonly that his objections to an (a)-type definition weren\u2019t\ndefinitive, but that there\u2019s much to be said for an\nintentionalistic definition, a definition couched in terms of the\nartist\u2019s intention.\n",
