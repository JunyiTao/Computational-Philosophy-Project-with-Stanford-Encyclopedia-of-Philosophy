When, for his own polemical purposes, Karl Barth\n(1886\u20131968) surveyed the religious traditions of the world in\nsearch of doctrinal parallels to Christianity, he concluded that it\nwas the Japanese Pure Land tradition that provided \u201cthe most\nexact, comprehensive, and plausible \u2018pagan\u2019 parallel to\nChristianity\u201d (Barth 1961, 1,2: 342). He expresses some shock at\nthe depth and specificity of resemblance, commenting that the Pure\nLand thought of H\u014dnen (1133\u20131212) and Shinran\n(1173\u20131263) in particular\n\n\nparallels not so much Roman or Greek Catholicism but rather of all\nthings the Christianity of the Reformation, and therefore\nconfronts Christianity with the question of its truth precisely in its\nform as a consistent religion of grace. (Barth 1961, 1,2:\n342; for a discussion on Barth\u2019s comparative comments, see\nHirota 2000a, especially pp. 35\u201338)\n\n\nBarth insightfully discusses specific doctrinal analogues in a long\nnote in Church Dogmatics, and these parallels have indeed\ntended to form the foundations for the understanding of Japanese Pure\nLand Buddhism in much of Western scholarly literature. Unfortunately,\nto the extent that Pure Land Buddhism has seemed to resemble\nProtestant Christianity, it has also been assumed to be divorced from\n\u201cgenuine\u201d or \u201coriginal\u201d Mahayana Buddhist\nthought and practices and devoid of any intellectual interest. Any\ncomparative considerations of Japanese Pure Land Buddhist thought,\ntherefore, require caution, even in the face of seemingly evident\nresemblance.\n",
