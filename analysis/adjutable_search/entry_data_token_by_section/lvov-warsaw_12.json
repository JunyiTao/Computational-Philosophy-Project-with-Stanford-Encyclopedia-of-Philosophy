    "main_text": "Ontology and Epistemology Inspired by Logic || Radical conventionalism and semantic epistemology\n6. The Significance of the Lvov-Warsaw School\n\nThe LWS acted in a country which never belonged to the philosophical\nsuperpowers. This circumstance is important for any assessment of the\nsignificance of the LWS. One can measure it on a national or an\ninternational scale. The importance of the LWS for Polish\nphilosophical culture was enormous. Twardowski fully realized his\ntask. He introduced scientific philosophy in his sense into Poland and\ncreated a powerful philosophical school. It did very much for the\nsubsequent development of philosophy in the country. In particular, it\npopularized very high standards of doing philosophy. This was\nimportant in the difficult times after 1945, when Marxism started an\nideological and political offensive against bourgeois philosophy. In\nfact, due to the strong methodological tradition related to the LWS,\nPolish philosophy did not lose its academic quality in\n1945\u20131989.\n\nAs far as the matter concerns international importance, one thing is\nclear. The logical achievements of the LWS became the most famous.\nDoubtless, the Warsaw school of logic contributed very much to the\ndevelopment of logic in the 20th century. Other\ncontributions are known but rather marginally. This is partially due\nto the fact that most philosophical writings of the LWS appeared in\nPolish. However, this factor does not explain everything. Many\nwritings of the LWS were originally published in English, French or\nGerman. However, their influence was very moderate, considerably\nlesser than that of similar writings of philosophers from the leading\ncountries. This is a pity, because radical conventionalism, reism or\nsemantic epistemology are the real philosophical pearls. But perhaps\nthis is the fate of results achieved in cultural provinces.\n",
