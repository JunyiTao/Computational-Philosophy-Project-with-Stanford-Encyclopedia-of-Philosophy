    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018incommensurable\u2019 means \u2018to have no common\nmeasure\u2019. The idea has its origins in Ancient Greek mathematics,\nwhere it meant no common measure between magnitudes. For example,\nthere is no common measure between the lengths of the side and the\ndiagonal of a square. Today, such incommensurable relations are\nrepresented by irrational numbers. The metaphorical application of\nthis mathematical notion specifically to the relation between\nsuccessive scientific theories became controversial in 1962 after it\nwas popularised by two influential philosophers of science: Thomas\nKuhn and Paul Feyerabend. They appeared to be challenging the\nrationality of natural science and were often considered to be among\n\u201cthe worst enemies of science\u201d (Theocharis and Psimopoulos\n1987, 596; cf. Preston et al. 2000). Since 1962, the\nincommensurability of scientific theories has been a widely discussed,\ncontroversial idea that was instrumental in the historical turn in the\nphilosophy of science and the establishment of the sociology of\nscience as a professional discipline.\n",
