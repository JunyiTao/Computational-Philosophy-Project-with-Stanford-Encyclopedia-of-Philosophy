    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity\n3. Social Models of Knowledge and Objectivity\n\n\nWith much of their work drawing attention to the perspectival nature\nof knowing and community-specific elements of knowing, feminist social\nepistemologists also need to articulate how we are to distinguish\nbetween better and worse knowing, or how we are able to identify\nobjective knowledge. In a 1988 article, Donna Haraway first introduced\nthe term situated knowledges to feminist epistemology, as a\nway of expressing a form of objectivity that takes seriously the\nsocial construction of knowledge and the perspectival nature of\nknowledge demonstrated by feminists. By invoking situated knowledges,\nHaraway suggests that all knowledge is local and limited, denying the\npossibility of the impartial view-from-nowhere that has often been\nassociated with the perspective of objective knowledge. What Haraway\nsuggests instead is an embodied objectivity (recognizing our material\nlocations) that consists in partial connection across perspectives or\nlocations: given the limited and perspectival nature of all knowing,\nthe most we can hope for is forms of knowledge that are objective in\nthe sense that they are translatable across particular subjective\nlocations. For Haraway, it is through building political solidarities\nand engaging in epistemic conversations across our positionings that\nwe come to agreement on how to know certain aspects of the world, but\nthese agreements will never completely erase the differences in our\nperspectives. Other feminist social epistemologists offer different\nanalyses of how to attain such partial connection.\n",
