    "main_text": "Species Permanence and Change in Antiquity || Medieval Revisions\n1.2 Medieval Revisions\n\nThe implications of Aristotle\u2019s complex thought for subsequent\ndiscussions of species, generated by the recovery of his writings in\nthe Latin West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were varied.\nOn one hand, Aristotle\u2019s apparent metaphysical requirement that\nthe soul-as-form (eidos) be permanent and enduring through\nthe process of the generation of \u201clike by like\u201d seemed for\nmuch of the tradition to amount to a denial of the possibility that\nnatural species could change over time in their essential properties,\neven though local adaptation in \u201caccidental\u201d properties\nwas fully possible. Since individual beings were considered to be\ndynamic composites of a material substrate and an immaterial and\neternal form, the accidental differentiation of the substantial form\nin individuals did not affect the metaphysical endurance of the\nspecies. It also made species extinction metaphysically impossible. In\nliving beings, the soul-as-form is serially passed on through time in\nthe act of generation to create an eternal continuity of the form.\nThis supplied a metaphysical foundation for the notion of species\npermanence without reliance on an external creative agency.\n\nIn the background of the discussion of the high middle ages was also\nthe theory of divine creation endorsed in inherited Jewish, Christian\nand Islamic thought. This required a distinction between the first\norigin of species in historical time, and the normal generation of the\nindividual. If the origin of species was attributed to divine action,\nthe temporal emergence of these species was not necessarily\ninstantaneous. Such a doctrine was the basis of Augustine of\nHippo\u2019s (354\u2013430) theory of the original creation of\nprimordial seeds (rationes seminales) of each species at an\noriginal moment in time, but with the emergence of species in\nhistorical time a possibility (Augustine, VI.13.23\u201325, [GL,\n175\u201376]). This theory of a temporalized creation, put forth\nexplicitly in detail in his treatise The Literal Interpretation of\nGenesis, allowed Augustine to argue that species emerged\nsequentially in historical time rather than all at once.\n\nThe great textual recoveries in the Latin West of Greek science,\nmedicine and philosophy of the twelfth through the fifteenth\ncenturies, generally accompanied by Islamic commentaries, introduced\nthese texts into a theological context that had been strongly defined\nby Augustinianism and neo-Platonism. The interplay between this\npre-existent tradition with new philosophical views defined a complex\nperiod of intellectual ferment that defined much of the subsequent\nintellectual and scientific history of the West (Gaukroger 2006: chp.\n2). The sustained efforts of major synthesizers, such as Thomas\nAquinas (1225\u20131274), to bring the massive body of\nnewly-recovered Aristotelian works into dialogue with Christian\nNeo-Platonism and Augustinianism, demanded new insights into the\nconception of the soul-body relation, the autonomy of the natural\norder and the role of secondary causes in the creation of the\nworld.\n\nConcerning the issue of species-permanence and origin, Aquinas treated\nthis in dialogue with Augustine\u2019s theory of serial creation. As\nhe comments in his major synthesis, the Summa Theologiae:\n\u201cNew species, if they appear, pre-exist in certain active\npowers\u201d (Pars I, Qu. 73, Rep Obj. 3). This claim suggests a\nreading of Aristotle that assumed the essential fixity of each\ndefinable substantial form, and the eternity of each species since\ncreation. But this conclusion must be read in the context of\nAquinas\u2019s complex theory of creation and the discussions of the\nproblem of universals in late Scholastic philosophy (see the entry\nmedieval problem of universals, and Wilkins 2009: Ch. 3). This context\nprevents any simple picture of Scholastic thought concerning the issue\nof species permanence, and it cannot be claimed that either Aristotle\nor later Scholastics such as Aquinas are responsible for the strong\n\u201cessentialist\u201d position often attributed to them in the\nliterature (R. A. Richards 2010: chp. 2). As developed below (2.2), it\ncan be argued that the species concept was \u201chardened\u201d only\nin the early modern period with the rise of the mechanical philosophy\nand its attendant preformationist embryology. The \u201cstrong\nessentialist\u201d position often attributed to Aristotle and\nScholasticism (Hull, 1965), is demonstrably a product of later\nhistorical developments (R.A. Richards 2010; Wilkins 2009; Oderberg\n2007: chp. 9; Winsor 2006; Lennox 1985, 1987, 2001).\n",
