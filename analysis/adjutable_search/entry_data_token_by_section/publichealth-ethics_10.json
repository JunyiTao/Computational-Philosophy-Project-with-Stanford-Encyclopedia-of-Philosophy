Three types of reasons can be advanced in\nfavor of viewing public health as transcending nation-states:\nself-interest (2.5.1); humanitarian considerations (2.5.2); and\njustice, rights, and duties (2.5.3) (Wolff 2012). Of note, the first\ntwo of these reasons do not originate from the standpoint of justice,\nthough, as we shall see, they engage important questions of justice in\ntheir pursuit. The third set of reasons engages all the issues\ndiscussed thus far in Section 2, and also encounters general debates\nabout the meaning, reach and plausibility of global justice generally\n(Powers and Faden 2019, 145\u2013186; Brock 2013; Miller 2007; see also the\nentries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n global justice).\n2.6.1 Self-Interest and Global Justice\n\nThe paradigmatic example of national self-interest is the motivation\nevery country has to prevent and contain emerging and re-emerging\ninfectious diseases. Outbreaks of these diseases typically occur in\nlow- and middle-income countries, but many have the potential to\nbecome threats to health in other parts of the world. It is in the\ninterests of wealthier nations to provide financial and technical\nsupport to poorer countries to build up their surveillance and rapid\nresponse capabilities, and to provide emergency assistance when\noutbreaks strike. Preventing and containing infectious diseases as\nthey emerge in the global south is an important way for wealthy\ncountries to reduce the likelihood of negative consequences in their\nown backyards.\n\nIt is also in the interests of all nations, but arguably especially\nwealthy nations, to participate in the global sharing of surveillance\ndata about and biosamples of suspect pathogens through mechanisms\nmaintained by the WHO. As we noted in Section 1.1.1, nearly 200\ncountries are signatories to International Health Regulations, which,\namong other things, obligate them to do so. However, it is here that\nserious clashes between self-interest and global justice can emerge.\nShared bio-samples are used to develop vaccines, diagnostics, and\ntreatments that, depending on the context, may be made available first\nor only affordable in higher income countries where these counter\nmeasures will likely be financed and developed. The fairness of this\nstate of affairs was challenged dramatically by Indonesia in January\n2007, when it refused to hand over viral samples during an outbreak of\nH5N1 influenza (bird flu) in that country. Although Indonesia cited\nwhat it viewed as multiple ethical breaches, Indonesia\u2019s main\nobjection was a complaint of injustice that samples provided freely by\nlow- and middle-income countries were used by companies in wealthy\nnations to develop vaccines and other products that developing\ncountries cannot afford (Sedyaningsih et al. 2008). An interesting\ntwist on the justice issues was whether, because the viral samples\nthat would be used by wealthy country companies to develop and produce\nvaccine would be of Indonesian origin, Indonesia had any greater claim\nto the vaccine than other low- and middle-income countries who also\ncould be seriously threatened by H5N1 but had the \u201cbad\nluck\u201d to not be among the first countries to supply viral\nsamples.\n\nSeveral steps have since been taken to address Indonesia\u2019s and\nrelated complaints, including a 2011 WHO framework for the sharing of\ninfluenza viruses and access to vaccines and other counter-measures\n(see World Health Organization 2012 in Other Internet Resources).\nHowever, associated challenges in justice around global biosamples and\nepidemic preparedness and response continue. In 2019, a somewhat\nsimilar claim of exploitation and injustice arose when it was reported\nthat blood samples from patients with Ebola in several West African\ncountries had made their way to laboratories in the US, UK and other\nwealthy nations under conditions that some in West Africa and\nelsewhere considered unfair, exploitative and disrespectful\n(Freudenthal 2019).\n\nIn the context of emerging infections, there is yet another, related\nway in which national self-interest and justice can collide. When the\nburdens of a public health intervention fall heavily on those who are\nalready disadvantaged, the justificatory hurdle is particularly high.\nThis problem regularly emerges in global epidemic preparedness and is\nat the heart of many global justice questions, including most notably\nin environmental justice controversies, such as the locating of\nhazardous waste facilities and hazardous industries in low-income\ncountries, typically in the poorest communities within those\ncountries. (Powers and Faden 2019, 204\u2013206). Because infectious\ndisease threats so often emerge first in poorer countries, global\nefforts to prevent and contain pandemic influenzas can place\nsignificant burdens on the world\u2019s poor and, as we have already noted,\nnot always with sufficient or guaranteed offsetting benefit. For\nexample, a principal strategy employed to prevent avian influenza H5N1\nfrom becoming a human pandemic in the mid-2000s was the destruction\nof infected birds and the banning of household poultry in urban\nsettings in affected countries. This policy was most burdensome for\npoor women and their families who relied on backyard poultry as their\nonly source of disposable income. Because there was often no or little\ncompensation for the losses, they were economically devastated as a\nconsequence (Bellagio Working Group 2007 in Other Internet Resources;\nFaden and Karron 2009; Uscher-Pines, Duggan, Garoon, Karron, and Faden\n2007).\n\nPerhaps most foundationally, the self-interest reason for nations to\nengage globally in public health cannot be separated from questions of\nglobal structural injustice in international relations more broadly.\nMany threats to public health, including the threats from climate\nchange, cannot be effectively addressed absent collective global\naction. However, in today\u2019s global order in which nations differ\ngreatly in wealth and other forms of power, the likelihood that\nagreements and coordinated action will fairly represent and fairly\nprotect the interests of people living in poorer nations is not good.\nIn the case of climate change, although the hottest, poorest, most\nagriculturally dependent countries have contributed the least to\ngreenhouse gas emissions, they are being hurt \u201cfirst and\nworst\u201d by global warming (Powers and Faden 2019, 172\u2013178). And\nyet enforceable requirements to reduce emissions continue to be\nblocked by high emission countries. In infectious disease as well, it\nis typically the poorest countries and the poorest people who are hit\nhardest in outbreaks and epidemics, but their power to influence\nglobal preparedness and response does not match their outsized\nvulnerability.\n2.6.2 Humanitarian Considerations and Global Justice\n\nHumanitarian interventions are among the most visible examples of\nglobal public health in action. These interventions are implemented\nand organized by diverse actors, including NGOs, philanthropies, and\nmultinational organizations like the UN and WHO, often with support\nfrom health and military agencies from diverse countries. One way to\nconceptualize humanitarian interventions is as the public health\nresponse to the general moral position that it is wrong to stand by\nand allow others to suffer in a crisis when we have the resources to\nhelp. Under this framework, we have humanitarian duties or duties of\nbeneficence to help those in desperate circumstances, and those duties\ntranscend national borders. Public health services, material, and\npersonnel are often among the most important responses in humanitarian\ncrises, not only in outbreaks and epidemics but also in natural\ndisasters, wars and violent conflict, displaced populations and mass\nmigrations, famines, and droughts.\n\nCommitments to global humanitarian assistance in public health do not\nentail a commitment to a robust understanding of global justice. Even\ntheorists who are strong statists acknowledge that there are\nobligations of humanitarian assistance to those in dire need in other\ncountries (see, e.g., Cohen and Sabel 2006; the entry on\n international distributive justice).\n This is not to say, however, that there are no moral controversies or\nissues of justice in humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian health\norganizations and health workers are regularly confronted with ethical\nchallenges that include, for example, tensions between humanitarian\nprinciples of impartiality and neutrality and ethical commitments to\nthe just distribution of limited health resources (Broussard et al.\n2019). Looming large over the entirety of humanitarian assistance is\nthe question of whether individuals and especially nations have\nadequately fulfilled their obligations of global humanitarian\nassistance. It is unclear what that question might mean if\nhumanitarian assistance is understood as falling under obligations of\nbeneficence rather than obligations of justice, since obligations of\nbeneficence are less determinate than obligations of justice. Some\naccounts of justice might be interpreted as including duties of\ninternational humanitarian assistance, for example, if these duties\nare considered to fall under minimal global obligations to fulfill\nhuman rights or the threshold in sufficientarian approaches to global\n justice.[13]\n However, these accounts do not provide guidance on what is arguably\nan important global justice question \u2013 whether countries are\ndoing their fair share in humanitarian aid.\n2.6.3 Public Health, Global Justice, Rights, and Duties\n\nAs important as humanitarian assistance is in global public health, it\ncannot even begin to address the central global justice challenge in\npublic health \u2013 the stark differences in health between\npopulations living in wealthy countries and populations living in low\nand some middle-income countries, especially the poorest in these\ncountries. The global justice challenge in health cannot, of course,\nbe separated from the global justice challenge in well-being,\ngenerally. And all the debates in justice theory between strong\nstatists and theorists who defend accounts of utilitarian and\negalitarian transnational obligation are relevant as well. Still,\nthere are some reasons to think that public health, and therefore\npublic health ethics, hold a special and very interesting location\nvis-\u00e0-vis discussions of global justice and our duties to the\ndistant poor (Holland 2007). If nothing else, questions about whether\nthere are duties of justice across national borders occur way too\nfrequently in public health for them to be ignored. Consider just a\nfew.\n\nEven when vaccines are not developed using biosamples sourced from\nlow-income countries, is it just for wealthy countries to produce and\nstockpile only the amount of vaccine needed to protect their own\npopulations when low- and middle-income countries do not have a\ncomparable capacity? While outbreaks rage in poor countries and deaths\nmount, should wealthy countries continue to reserve their entire\nvaccine supply for their own population?\n\nIntellectual property regimes and international trade agreements\nprovide tremendous protections for pharmaceutical companies in wealthy\ncountries, with the result that many drugs and biologics are priced\nwell beyond what low-income countries can afford. To take what some\nconsider the most egregious case, should restrictions on the\nproduction and distribution of generics be upheld even when they\nhinder the containment of easily treatable diseases in poor countries\n(Pogge 2002; Grover, Citro, Mankad and Lander 2012)?\n\nOnly wealthy countries have the financial and human resources to make\nsizable investments in biomedical research. Do these countries have\nobligations in justice to allocate resources to address the major\nhealth problems of the world\u2019s poor? And finally, public health\ninfrastructures in low-income countries struggle from shortages of\nhealth professionals, in part because of migration of professionals to\nwealthy countries. Is this a problem that health authorities in\nwealthy countries should work to contain, even as the health of their\nown populations benefit?\n\nOne response to these specific challenges is to frame them all as\njustifiable claims of justice against the world\u2019s wealthy countries\nand persons. On one of the most compelling arguments for this view,\nwealthy countries and their citizens are responsible for transnational\ninstitutional structures that contribute to and exacerbate unjust\nglobal inequalities, including global health inequalities. The\ncontinuing beneficiaries of these structures have a duty not only to\nreform these structures but also to ensure that the effects of\nresultant unjust inequalities are mitigated. In public health, this\nincludes providing resources to meet the needs generated in health\ncrises and also helping to build effective public health\ninfrastructures in impoverished countries so that crises can be\naverted in the future. So understood, failing to do so is an injustice\nand not merely a failure to act charitably or in accordance with\nhumanitarian\n obligations.[14]\n Ultimately, that is why we cannot escape responsibility for\nintervening when something like an Ebola outbreak occurs and not\nmerely because of concerns about self-interest or humanitarian\nsentiments (Powers and Faden 2019).\n\nThose who make the case for viewing global health inequalities as\nunjust often appeal to health as a fundamental human right, drawing on\nthe field of health and human rights. As we have already noted, many\nin public health accept that health is a fundamental right, as\ncodified in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nor otherwise (General Assembly 1948). As is true for all human rights,\ndifficult questions immediately emerge about the assignment of\nresponsibility for protecting, promoting, and fulfilling the right to\nhealth and the specification of the content of the right (Millum and\nEmanuel 2012; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015a; Tasioulas and Vayena 2015b).\nAt least as long as the global order is organized as it is, there are\ngood reasons to view the nation-state as having first line\nresponsibility for the health and other human rights of those living\nwithin its borders. However, this does not absolve nation-states of\nobligations to at least forebear from undermining the ability of other\ncountries to meet their own human rights obligations. Arguably,\nnation-states have an obligation in justice to address impediments to\nhuman rights fulfillment that flow from unjust differentials of\ninterstate and global institutional power (Powers and Faden 2019,\n146). Also, acknowledging that nation-states are the first line of\ndefense in human rights fulfillment does not address who is\nresponsible for the human rights of people living in countries who\ncannot or will not protect their interests, including the human right\nto health (Powers and Faden 2019, 146\u2013177).\n\nIf we view inequalities between people living in wealthy nations and\nthose living in the rest of the world as a matter of justice rather\nthan as a humanitarian concern, then those who view public health ethics\nthrough the perspective of justice have plenty to think about. To\nthese theorists, the extraordinary disparities in life expectancy,\nchild survival, and health that distinguish those who live in rich and\npoor countries constitute a profound injustice that it is the duty of\nthe global community to redress. The necessary steps to ameliorate\nthese injustices go beyond simple medical care and classical public\nhealth interventions. Improving the health of the world\u2019s poor is\nindelibly tied to economic, social, educational, and environmental\nimprovements as well, and health-related justice claims are not easily\nseparable from justice claims that arise in those other contexts.\n\nThe fact that there are people who live in such poverty and\ndeprivation that they and their children die of starvation and the\nsimplest infection should be a sufficient indicator that these global\ninstitutional schemes are seriously\n unjust.[15]\n",
