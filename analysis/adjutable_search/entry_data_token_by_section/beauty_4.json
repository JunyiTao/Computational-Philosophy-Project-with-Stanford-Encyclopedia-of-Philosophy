    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty || Love and Longing\n2.3 Love and Longing\n\nEdmund Burke, expressing an ancient tradition, writes that, \u201cby\nbeauty I mean, that quality or those qualities in bodies, by which\nthey cause love, or some passion similar to it\u201d (Burke 1757,\n83). As we have seen, in almost all treatments of beauty, even the\nmost apparently object or objectively-oriented, there is a moment in\nwhich the subjective qualities of the experience of beauty are\nemphasized: rhapsodically, perhaps, or in terms of pleasure or\nataraxia, as in Schopenhauer. For example, we have already\nseen Plotinus, for whom beauty is certainly not subjective, describe\nthe experience of beauty ecstatically. In the idealist tradition, the\nhuman soul, as it were, recognizes in beauty its true origin and\ndestiny. Among the Greeks, the connection of beauty with love is\nproverbial from early myth, and Aphrodite the goddess of love won the\nJudgment of Paris by promising Paris the most beautiful woman in the\nworld.\n\nThere is an historical connection between idealist accounts of beauty\nand those that connect it to love and longing, though there would seem\nto be no entailment either way. We have Sappho\u2019s famous fragment\n16: \u201cSome say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, others\ncall a fleet the most beautiful sights the dark world offers, but I\nsay it\u2019s whatever you love best\u201d (Sappho, 16). (Indeed, at\nPhaedrus 236c, Socrates appears to defer to \u201cthe fair\nSappho\u201d as having had greater insight than himself on love\n[Plato, 483].)\n\nPlato\u2019s discussions of beauty in the Symposium and the\nPhaedrus occur in the context of the theme of erotic love. In\nthe former, love is portrayed as the \u2018child\u2019 of poverty\nand plenty. \u201cNor is he delicate and lovely as most of us\nbelieve, but harsh and arid, barefoot and homeless\u201d (Plato, 556\n[Symposium 203b\u2013d]). Love is portrayed as a lack or absence that\nseeks its own fulfillment in beauty: a picture of mortality as an\ninfinite longing. Love is always in a state of lack and hence of\ndesire: the desire to possess the beautiful. Then if this state of\ninfinite longing could be trained on the truth, we would have a path\nto wisdom. The basic idea has been recovered many times, for example\nby the Romantics. It fueled the cult of idealized or courtly love\nthrough the Middle Ages, in which the beloved became a symbol of the\ninfinite.\n\nRecent work on the theory of beauty has revived this idea, and turning\naway from pleasure has turned toward love or longing (which are not\nnecessarily entirely pleasurable experiences) as the experiential\ncorrelate of beauty. Both Sartwell and Nehamas use Sappho\u2019s\nfragment 16 as an epigraph. Sartwell defines beauty as \u201cthe\nobject of longing\u201d and characterizes longing as intense and\nunfulfilled desire. He calls it a fundamental condition of a finite\nbeing in time, where we are always in the process of losing whatever\nwe have, and are thus irremediably in a state of longing. And Nehamas\nwrites that \u201cI think of beauty as the emblem of what we lack, the mark\nof an art that speaks to our desire. \u2026 Beautiful things\ndon\u2019t stand aloof, but direct our attention and our desire to\neverything else we must learn or acquire in order to understand and\npossess, and they quicken the sense of life, giving it new shape and\ndirection\u201d (Nehamas 2007, 77).\n",
