    "main_text": "Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation? || Normative Conceptualism\n3.4 Normative Conceptualism\n\nWe have assumed that there are worldly states of affairs and\nproperties, and we take it that there are normative truths, but this\ndoes not force us to the conclusion that there are normative states of\naffairs and normative properties. Normative objectualism holds that\nthere are such things, but normative conceptualism holds that\nnormativity lies in the realm of thought rather than in the realm of\nreality that we represent in our thought. Objectualism holds that\nthere are states of affairs and properties that instantiate the\nnormativity property (or one of the normativity properties), whereas\nconceptualism denies this and holds that it is only concepts and\npropositions that are normative. Conceptualist theories agree that\nthere are normative truths, but deny that any states of affairs or\nproperties are normative\n3.4.1 Anti-realist conceptualism: non-cognitivist expressivism\n\nOne example of normative conceptualism is the anti-realist view\ngenerally called \u201cnon-cognitivist expressivism\u201d, or simply\n\u201cexpressivism\u201d. This is the view that, roughly, normative\nassertions express conative attitudes such as approval, disapproval,\naversion, or subscription to a norm. Such attitudes are akin to\ndesires rather than to cognitive states, such as beliefs, that\nrepresent the world as being one way or another. Expressivism holds\nthat normative judgments are at least partly constituted by conative\nattitudes taken toward things.\n\nIn the simplest cases, a normative judgment might just be an attitude.\nFor example, one might hold that the assertion that it would be bad to\ndrink Dr. Pepper expresses an aversion to drinking Dr. Pepper, and,\nmoreover, that this aversion just is the judgment that it\nwould be bad to drink Dr. Pepper. In more complex cases, a normative\njudgment might have some non-normative content, but inasmuch as it is\nnormative, it would be partly constituted by an attitude. An example\nof this might be the assertion that Justin was bad to drink another\nDr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivists accordingly take normative judgments to be very\ndifferent from ordinary beliefs. The belief that Dr. Pepper is sweet\nis a cognitive state of mind that takes the proposition that Dr.\nPepper is sweet as its intensional object and that represents Dr.\nPepper as having the property sweetness. The assertion that\nDr. Pepper is sweet expresses this belief. But, in the expressivist\nview, the assertion that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper\ndoes not express a cognitive state of mind that takes a proposition as\nits object and that represents drinking another Dr. Pepper as having a\nproperty. It rather expresses an aversion or some similar conative\nattitude.\n\nOne consideration that has motivated expressivism is the idea that\nhaving a normative judgment entails being motivated in some\nappropriate way. For example, we would expect that a person who thinks\nit would be bad to have another Dr. Pepper is motivated to avoid or to\noppose having another Dr. Pepper. According to the position called\nmotivational judgment internalism (MJI), such motivation is entailed\nby having a normative judgment. Motivation is internal to\nnormative judgment. Expressivists argue that the best explanation of\nMJI is the expressivist thesis that normative judgments consist at\nleast in part in motivating conative attitudes of some kind, such as\naversions or attractions.\n\nExpressivism has also been motivated by some of the considerations\nthat we explored in discussing arguments for the error theory. There\nis the idea that normative states of affairs would be metaphysically\nproblematic \u2013 perhaps because, it might seem, states of affairs of\nthis kind would have to have an intrinsic practical force that is\nunintelligible \u2013 or, it might seem, they would have to have an\nunintelligible intrinsic magnetism or repulsion. If this is correct,\nthen, it might seem, it would be a mistake to postulate the existence\nof normative states of affairs. This reasoning can be contested, as we\nsaw. But even if it is correct, it need not lead to an error theory.\nThere is the alternative of taking our normative judgments to consist\nin conative attitudes, such as aversions or attractions, rather than\nto be beliefs that purport to represent normative states of affairs.\nExpressivism can seem in this way to make room for normative truths\nwithout postulating the existence of normative states of affairs.\n\nExpressivism can make room for normative truths and facts if it is\ncombined with minimalist views of the meanings of \u201ctrue\u201d\nand \u201cfact\u201d. The result of such a combination would allow\nexpressivism to make sense of the claim that it is true, and a fact,\nthat it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper. For, on the\nminimalist view, to claim these things would simply be a way of\nclaiming that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivism might also be combined with a minimalist view of the use\nof the term \u201cbelief\u201d, according to which beliefs are the\npsychological states, whatever their nature, that are expressed by\nassertions. On this view, an expressivist could agree that we believe\nit would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper. But, for the\nexpressivist, this \u201cbelief\u201d or judgment is a conative\nstate of aversion or something like aversion. It is not the kind of\ncognitive state that is expressed when we assert that Dr Pepper is\nsweet. On this view, then, there are at least two radically different\nkinds of belief \u2013 cognitive states that take propositions as their\nobjects and conative states that consist in having a conative attitude\nto something. And there presumably are also mixed states.\n\nAs we mentioned, Blackburn has a view that combines expressivism with\nminimalism about \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cfact\u201d, and\n\u201cproperty\u201d, and his view also incorporates a minimalism\nabout \u201cbelief\u201d (Blackburn 2006). He calls this position,\n\u201cquasi-realism\u201d.\n\nAn expressivist would presumably deny that there is a worldly state of\naffairs of its being bad to have another Dr. Pepper. There is the\naversion to drinking another Dr. Pepper, of course. But the claim that\nit would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper is not a psychological\nclaim. It is not a claim about an aversion, although it\nexpresses an aversion. That is, this aversion is not a state\nof affairs that makes it true that it would be bad to drink another\nDr. Pepper. It is a psychological state that we express in saying it\nwould be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper.\n\nExpressivism is, then, an example of normative conceptualism.\nProperly understood, it says, normativity is not a feature of states\nof affairs in the world; it is a feature of a way or ways of thinking\nof things. There are no normative states of affairs in the world.\nThere are only normative ways of thinking.\n\nIt is arguable that so-called quietism, as well as Parfit\u2019s\ncognitivist anti-realism, are also examples of normative\nconceptualism. They contend that normative thought and talk do not\ncommit us metaphysically to anything we wouldn\u2019t otherwise be\ncommitted to. So, presumably, they must agree with expressivism that\nnormativity is not to be accounted for by anything in our metaphysics.\nPerhaps, then, it is a feature of our ways of thinking of things.\n\nReturn now to the question whether normativity can be given a\nnaturalistic explanation. For the expressivist, this is the question\nwhether the normativity of normative judgments can be given a\nnaturalistic explanation. And their answer would presumably be\naffirmative. We have just sketched the kind of explanation an\nexpressivist would provide. We have, and we endorse, the\n\u201cbelief\u201d we might express by saying it would be bad to\ndrink another Dr. Pepper. This thought consists in having an aversion\nto drinking another Dr. Pepper. There is a variety of such attitudes\nor \u201cstances\u201d, to use Blackburn\u2019s term (2006), and\nthey are the characteristic constituents of normative thoughts. For a\nthought to be normative is, roughly, for it to have some such\nconstituent. This is a sketch of the expressivist answer to our\nquestion.\n\nNote that this account of normativity explains normative thought and\ntalk in a way that we might also use to explain slurring thought and\ntalk, such as talk about \u201ckikes\u201d, \u201chuns\u201d,\n\u201cYankees\u201d, and the like. One might think that this counts\nagainst expressivism since, we take it, the emotionally-laden slurring\nways of thinking of Jews, Germans, and Americans, are not\nnormative.\n\nThere are several examples of expressivism, including Allan\nGibbard\u2019s somewhat different but complementary approaches (1990,\n2003), and Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons\u2019s cognitivist\nexpressivism (2006). We do not explore these different theories. For\ndetailed discussion of expressivism, see Mark Schroeder (2010). See\nalso the entry on\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism.\n3.4.2 Realist conceptualism\n\nNormative realism is a kind of cognitivism. It says that just as the\nassertion that Dr. Pepper is sweet expresses a belief, so the\nassertion that it would be bad to drink another Dr. Pepper expresses a\nbelief \u2013 both express a cognitive state of mind that takes a\nproposition as its object and that represents the world as being one\nway or another. Quasi-realism would allow us to call conative states\nof mind, such as an aversion to drinking another Dr. Pepper,\n\u201cbeliefs\u201d, but it holds that beliefs of this kind are\nconative states that are different in their intrinsic nature from\nordinary beliefs. Cognitivists, including normative naturalists and\nnon-naturalists, hold that normative judgments are ordinary beliefs,\ncognitive states that represent worldly states of affairs that are\ntheir truth conditions.\n\nWe have already seen that there is an important difference between\nprimitivist forms of normative realism and forms of realism that aim\nto explain the intrinsic nature of the normativity properties. But\nthere is also an important difference between forms of normative\nrealism that affirm, and those that deny, that there are normative\nworldly states of affairs and normative properties.\n\nRealist normative conceptualism holds that normativity is a\nfeature of some of our ways of thinking of certain properties and\nstates of affairs rather than being a property of those properties and\nstates of affairs themselves. Hence, normativity is to be found in the\nrealm of thought rather than in the realm of reality that we represent\nin our thought. Realist normative conceptualism is a form at least of\nbasic normative realism since it holds that normative judgments\nrepresent worldly states of affairs that are their truth conditions,\nand that normative concepts are concepts of worldly properties. What\nit denies is that these states of affairs and properties are\nthemselves normative. Matti Eklund calls this view, or at least\nnaturalist versions of it, presentationalism (Eklund 2017: ch\n6).\n\nNormative conceptualism is an attractive position for normative\nnaturalists because it enables them to hold that the properties\nreferred to by the normative concepts are natural ones, but without\nhaving to provide a naturalistic constitutive explanation of the\nnormativity property instantiated by these properties. It avoids this\nchallenging problem because it denies that the property of being\nnormative is instantiated by any properties and, indeed, by any states\nof affairs. It holds that only normative concepts and propositions are\nnormative.\n\nThere is a subtly different version of naturalist normative\nconceptualism. On this version, there are normative states of\naffairs and properties, but their being normative is entirely\nderivative from the normativity of the normative ways of thinking that\nrepresent these states of affairs and properties. Their being\nnormative consists in their being represented by normative\npropositions or concepts. Their normativity is extrinsic, rather than\nintrinsic. It would seem to follow that these states of affairs and\nproperties could exist, or might have existed, without being\nnormative. The property we represent in thought as wrongness is\nnormative only because we think of it this way, and we might not have\nthought of it in this way. This implication should be compared with\nthe implication, of the other version of naturalist normative\nconceptualism, that there are no normative states of affairs or\nproperties.\n\nUnless it embraces primitivism, normative conceptualism still needs to\nexplain what it is about the normative concepts in virtue of which\nthey are normative. But this is a challenge it shares with all other\nforms of ethical naturalism and ethical non-naturalism, and perhaps\nalso with all forms of ethical anti-realism. Further, it is open to\nnaturalist normative conceptualism to embrace primitivism and agree\nwith non-naturalists that the normative concepts are not analyzable in\nnon-normative terms. For this thesis is not problematic to naturalism.\nNaturalism is primarily a metaphysical thesis about what there is. It\nis not a thesis about the analysis of our concepts or ways of\nthinking.\n\nOne problem faced by realist normative conceptualism is that it\narguably is a necessary truth that the properties referred to or\nrepresented by normative concepts are normative. For instance,\narguably, if any property is referred to or represented by our concept\n<wrong> it is the property wrongness. And unless\nit embraces error theory, normative conceptualism agrees that there is\na property that is referred to or represented by our concept\n<wrong>. So it is committed to there being a property\nwrongness. And it would seem to be a necessary truth that any\nsuch property is normative in itself and not merely in virtue of the\nfact that some normative concept of ours refers to it or represents\nit. If this is right, then unless it embraces error theory, realist\nnormative conceptualism faces a fatal problem.\n3.5 Normative Objectualism\n\nObjectualist theories, unlike conceptualist ones, hold that there are\nworldly states of affairs and properties that are themselves\nnormative. Objectualist theories take it that normativity is found in\nthe world, and not merely in the realm of thought about the world. It\nholds that certain properties and facts instantiate a normativity\nproperty.\n\nAs we saw, normative realism is compatible with both normative\nformalism and normative conceptualism, but it is typically\nobjectualist. In this section, then, we return to normative realism in\nits objectualist form. In\n section 3.1,\n we saw that normativity formalism provides an affirmative answer to\nour guiding question, since it explains normativity by reference to\nrules or norms or social practices. We set aside normativity formalism\nbecause the controversial issue is whether a robust or authoritative\nnormativity can be given a constitutive naturalistic explanation. In\n section 3.2\n we discussed the explanatory challenge faced by realist theories, and\nin\n section 3.3,\n we considered primitivist realist theories, which deny that any\nconstitutive explanation of normativity is possible.\n Section 3.4\n considered both anti-realist and realist versions of normativity\nconceptualism. Non-cognitivist expressivism is a kind of normativity\nconceptualism that offers a naturalistic constitutive explanation of\nthe normativity of normative judgments and concepts. Realist versions\nof conceptualism would either be primitivist, or they would aim to\nprovide a constitutive explanation of the normativity of normative\njudgments and concepts. In this section, we turn to objectualist forms\nof ethical realism and the question whether theories of this kinds are\nable to answer our guiding question.\n\nThere are both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of normativity\nobjectualism. Non-naturalism, however, is typically primitivist. It\ngives a negative answer to our guiding question. As we saw, ethical\nnaturalism can also be primitivist. But if a theory is going to offer\na constitutive explanation of normativity, or constitutive accounts of\nthe normative properties and concepts, in each case the explanans\nproposed by the theory is almost certain to be a natural property or\ncondition. That is, the theory is almost certain to be a kind of\nreductive normative naturalism. Accordingly, this section\ndiscusses theories of this kind.\n\nThere are many varieties of normative naturalism, as we have seen. All\nsuch theories have in common the realist claim that there are worldly\nstates of affairs that are represented by, and that are the truth\nconditions of, normative truths, and that there are properties that\nare referred to and ascribed by normative predicates. Objectualist\nviews add that these properties and states of affairs are normative.\nNaturalist views add that these states of affairs and properties are\nnatural ones.\n\nReductive normative naturalism claims that naturalistic\nconstitutive explanations of normativity and of the normative\nproperties and concepts are available, at least in principle. We began\n section 3\n with the question whether normativity can be given a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation. Reductive normative naturalism offers an\naffirmative answer. Some naturalists might merely have the\naspirational view that although an adequate reduction is not yet\navailable, we should expect there to be one in the offing, since the\nnormative states of affairs and properties are natural. But the most\ninteresting forms of reductive normative naturalism offer accounts of\nthe nature of normativity, or at least sketches of such. Theories of\nthis kind propose, for each normative explanandum and for the property\nof normativity itself, a natural property as its explanans.\n\nA distinction needs to be drawn between analytic and non-analytic\nreductive normative naturalism. Both kinds of theory claim that\nnormative properties are natural ones and both offer sketches of\nnaturalistic constitutive explanations of these properties. Analytic\ntheories contend that their analyses are conceptual truths,\nwhereas non-analytic ones do not contend this.\n\nThere are many objections to normative naturalism in general and to\nreductive normative naturalism in particular. In this entry, we do not\ninvestigate these objections in detail, or arguments in favor of\nnaturalism. For an examination of these objections and arguments, see\nentries on\n moral naturalism\n and\n moral non-naturalism.\n\nOne might think it is obvious that there could not be a\ncorrect naturalistic constitutive explanation of normativity or of the\nnormative properties. Consider the property wrongness,\nassuming there is such a thing. Assuming that this property is\nnormative, a correct constitutive explanation of the essential nature\nof this property would need to identify a natural property (or\nnaturalistic condition) as the explanans, and this natural property\nwould have to be normative. According to a kind of meta-ethical\nutilitarian naturalism, for example, for an action to be wrong is for\nit to fail to maximize the general happiness. Since wrongness\nis normative, this theory is correct only if the property failing\nto maximize the general happiness is normative. But it might seem\nobvious that this property is not normative, and therefore that the\nutilitarian naturalist view cannot be correct. It is part of the\nessential nature of wrongness that it is normative, but, one\nmight think, it obviously is not part of the essential nature\nof the property of failing to maximize the general happiness that it\nis normative. Indeed, it might seem, this property obviously is not\nnormative. Failing to maximize the general happiness is normatively\nrelevant, the utilitarian thinks, because an action that\nfails in this way is wrong for this reason \u2013 but this is not a\nmatter of its nature. Or so one might think. And, generalizing, one\nmight think that there could not be a correct naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of the nature of any of the normative\nproperties because natural properties are not normative.\n\nFor a similar reason, one might think there could not be a correct\nnaturalistic constitutive explanation of the (second-order)\nproperty of being normative, or of any of the normativity properties.\nA correct naturalistic account of the essential nature of any such\nproperty would need to identify a natural property (or naturalistic\ncondition) as the explanans, where this explanans would be the\nessential nature of the normative property. But if natural properties\nand conditions are not normative, no such thing could be the essential\nnature of the property of being normative.\n\nThese arguments simply raise the issue whether it is correct that no\nnatural property is normative. A utilitarian naturalist might respond\nto the above argument, for example, by claiming that the nature of the\nproperty of failing to maximize the general happiness is such that\nactions with this property are wrong, and, since wrongness is\nessentially normative, normativity is inherent as well in the nature\nof the property failing to maximize the general\nhappiness.\n\nAt the root of all of the objections to normative naturalism is\nperhaps the \u201cJust too Different\u201d objection, the claim that\nnormative properties are just too different in their nature from\nnatural properties for them to be natural properties (Parfit\n2011; Enoch 2011; Copp 2020a). This is an intuitive claim rather than\nan argument. Derek Parfit contends, for example, that the normative\nconcepts rule out naturalism; that wrongness could no more be\nidentical to some natural property than heat could be identical to a\ncabbage (Parfit 2011, vol. II: 325). A naturalist might respond that,\nsimilarly, heat seems to be too different from mean molecular kinetic\nenergy for it to be identical to that, yet the consensus seems to be\nthat heat is identical to mean molecular kinetic energy, or\nsomething like that. So \u201cjust too different\u201d intuitions\nare hardly decisive.\n\nIn the next section of this entry, we briefly consider several\nexamples of proposed constitutive explanations of normativity,\nincluding both naturalist explanations and other kinds.\n4. Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity\n\nIn order to explain what normativity consists in, philosophers have\npursued just a few basic strategies. First, it is evident that there\nis a close relationship between normative beliefs and decisions or\nactions, at least when a person is rational. Given this, some theories\npropose a kind of constitutive relationship between normativity and\nmotivation, or between normativity and intentions to act, or between\nnormativity and agency. Second, it has seemed evident to some\nphilosophers that normativity must somehow have a deep psychological\nground if normative demands are not to seem alien to people. So some\ntheories propose that normativity is tied to the essential nature of\npersons as rational, or to what is essential to agency, or at least to\nthe \u201cidentity\u201d of agents, or their \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d. Third, some theories look at the role of normative\nbeliefs in the lives of human beings, in orienting humans to what will\nmake for flourishing lives, or in coordinating and organizing human\nbeings in joint activities in their societies in ways that allow their\nsocieties to flourish.\n\nThis entry will briefly introduce eight kinds of theory. Be aware,\nthat these will be merely sketches of the basic ideas. Note also that\nthe theories are not all intended as examples of reductive normative\nnaturalistic realism. In some cases, the intention is merely to\nilluminate the nature of normativity without achieving a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity. Some of the examples are realist, but some\nare anti-realist, expressivist or constructivist. And among the\nrealist cases are examples of both mind-independent normative realism\nand of basic normative realism. We begin with a perspective on the\nnature of normativity that has been taken to support non-cognitivist\nexpressivism, although it can also be interpreted in a way that is\nfriendly to realism. We then sketch two ideas that are examples of\nbasic-realist approaches, but that eschew mind-independence. They are\nsometimes classified as \u201cconstructivist\u201d and anti-realist.\nIt is not until we reach the final two cases, in\n section 4.7\n and\n section 4.8,\n that we find clear examples of naturalistic constitutive explanations\nof robust normativity that are also examples of mind-independent\nrealism. What follows, then, are eight strategies that have been\nused in attempting to explain normativity.\n4.1 Explaining Normativity via Motivation\n\nOne familiar view is that normative thought has a special, internal,\nconnection to motivation. According to motivational judgment\ninternalism (MJI), it is a necessary truth that a person who believes\nshe ought to do something is motivated accordingly. Generalizing,\nperhaps all normative thoughts are such that, necessarily, a person\nwith a normative thought is thereby motivated accordingly. This\nconnection to motivation arguably must be due to the content of\nnormative beliefs, since not all beliefs have such a close connection\nto motivation. And this suggests an account of normativity. It would\nsay, roughly, that normative propositions are such because,\nnecessarily, anyone who believes such a proposition is motivated\naccordingly.\n\nA different view would invoke the neo-Humean view that no belief\n(properly so called) entails or necessitates motivation; beliefs\nmotivate only when combined with an appropriately related desire. On\nthis view, if moral judgments entail motivation, then moral judgments\nare not (ordinary) beliefs, properly so-called. They must instead be\nat least partly constituted by conative states that do necessarily\nmotivate. In this way, MJI can lead to non-cognitive expressivism.\n\nThe expressivist, Allan Gibbard, has proposed, for example, that\nnormative states of mind are planning states, akin to intentions. To\njudge that it does not make sense to have another Dr. Pepper consists\nin something like planning not to have another Dr. Pepper. Gibbard has\ndeveloped a systematic and sophisticated account to put flesh on this\nbasic idea (Gibbard 2003).\n\nUnfortunately, MJI is controversial and there are a variety of\ncounter-examples and arguments against it (Brink 1989; Copp 2007: chap\n8; Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999; for relevant discussion, see entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external).\n Accordingly, defenders of the basic intuition have qualified and\namended MJI. Michael Smith contends, for example, that it is a\nnecessary truth that a person who believes she ought to do something\nis motivated accordingly unless she is practically irrational (1994).\nHe has also proposed a naturalistic account of what it is to be\npractically rational. His approach lends support to a form of\nnaturalistic normative realism rather than to a form of\nexpressivism.\n4.2 Explaining Normativity via Desire-based reasons\n\nA widespread view is that normative facts are analyzable in terms of\nfacts about reasons. So in this and the next sections, we investigate\nattempts to explain the nature of normativity by explaining the nature\nof reasons.\n\nIt is widely thought that a person has reason to satisfy her desires.\nOn this view, for instance, if I want some ice cream, I have reason to\nget some. Some philosophers hold that all practical reasons are\nbasically of this nature. The basic idea is that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction, but there are different\nversions of the idea. For example, some would insist that the desires\nin question are not necessarily the desires that a person actually\nhas, but are instead ones that she would have if she were fully\ninformed and if she brought all relevant facts vividly to mind (Brandt\n1979). See the entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external.\n\nOne might combine the idea that normative facts are analyzable in\nterms of facts about reasons with the idea that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction. On this basis, one might\nconclude that all normative facts are fundamentally facts about desire\nsatisfaction \u2013 or informed desire satisfaction, or the like. One\nmight then propose that the normativity of a fact consists in its\nbeing analyzable as a fact (of some relevant kind) about desire\nsatisfaction. This then would point the way toward a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of normativity. This basic strategy has been\ndeveloped in detail by Mark Schroeder (2007).\n\nViews of this kind would be classified as realist, if one had in mind\nwhat we earlier called \u201cbasic realism\u201d, or as irrealist or\nanti-realist, if one had in mind what we earlier called\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d. Sharon Street has a view of\nthis kind that she classifies as constructivist (2008, 2010).\n\nOne problem is that our second-order desires can conflict with our\nfirst-order ones. We can desire to get rid of some of our desires, for\nexample, and in this case it might seem that the latter desires\ndon\u2019t give us reason to satisfy them. Following Harry Frankfurt,\none might argue that only desires that are endorsed by higher order\ndesires, or at least not undermined by them, ground reasons (Frankfurt\n1971).\n\nThere are also attempts to undermine these approaches. Christine\nKorsgaard has argued, for example, that one has a reason to satisfy a\ndesire only if the object of the desire is something that is valuable\nitself, or something that will tend to promote something valuable\n(Korsgaard 1996).\n4.3 Explaining Normativity via Practical identity\n\nIt can seem that desires can be too shallow in our psychology to\nground reasons. Christine Korsgaard has suggested that normativity\nmight instead be grounded in our \u201cpractical\nidentity\u201d \u2013 in features of ourselves that we value\n(1996). Our practical identity is to be understood as a matter of\nattitudes we take to ourselves and our lives, but it is something more\ncentral to our sense of ourselves than mere desire. On\nKorsgaard\u2019s account, a parent who values parenthood thereby has\nreasons to act as parents are meant to act. Some people have practical\nidentities that are regrettable, of course, such as the practical\nidentity of a gangster. But, Korsgaard argues, a person\u2019s\npractical identity grounds reasons for her only if it is compatible\nwith the practical identities of everyone else.\n\nThe strategy outlined in the preceding section is to take the\nnormativity of a fact to consist in the fact\u2019s being, or being\nanalyzable as, a fact about reasons. One might then take up\nKorsgaard\u2019s account of reasons as facts about practical identity\nand propose that the normativity of a fact consists in the\nfact\u2019s being, or being analyzable as, a suitable fact about\npractical identity.\n\nThis account can still seem to leave too much to a person\u2019s\ncontingent psychology. It would seem to imply that a rootless person\nwho is aimless and untethered has no reasons whatsoever since he has\nno practical identity. He values nothing about his life. Yet,\nplausibly, there are still things he has reason to do and not to\ndo.\n\nThe theory of normativity on offer here might be classified as an\nexample of basic realism, but it isn\u2019t an example of\nmind-independent realism. It tends to be classified as a\nconstructivist and anti-realist (Street 2010).\n4.4 Explaining Normativity via Essential features of agency or action\n\nIt has seemed to some philosophers that a better strategy would be to\nexplain normativity in terms of agency. We are agents, and cannot help\nbut be agents, performing actions (Korsgaard 1996).\n\nDavid Velleman (2000) considers the idea that the key to\nunderstanding normativity in action is to discover what stands to\naction as truth stands to belief. It is constitutive of belief that it\naims at the truth. Truth is normative for belief. That is, roughly,\nbeliefs ought to be true, and a believer is subject to a requirement\nto be responsive to the truth. Similarly, perhaps, it is constitutive\nof action that it aims at the good. The good is normative for action.\nThat is, actions ought to promote the good, and a person who acts is\nsubject to a requirement to be responsive to the good. Velleman\nargues, however, for the different idea that it is constitutive of\nagency that agents have the aim of knowing what they\nare doing. Self-knowledge is the constitutive aim of\naction. Further, Velleman argues, this determines the criterion\nof success in action, which in turn determines which\nconsiderations count as reasons for action.\n\nChristine Korsgaard has proposed (1996), roughly, that in order to\ncount as an action, something done by a person must be done for a\nreason, and this means it must accord with norms that any rational\nagent could accept. Given what actions are, one can act only if one\nacts in accord with such norms.\n\nThese ideas could be interpreted as offering, or at least pointing in\nthe direction of, constitutive accounts of normativity. The basic idea\nwould be that it is constitutive of a fact\u2019s being normative in\nrelation to action or belief that the fact be appropriately related to\nthe essence of action or belief, respectively.\n\nOne response to proposals of these kinds is that, if agency is\nunderstood as these philosophers suggest, then agency is optional.\nThat is, perhaps, a person can opt out of the aim to have\nself-knowledge, or to do things that accord with norms of practical\nreason, by opting to do things that do not count as actions in the\npreferred sense that these proposals spell out. See David Enoch\n(2006).\n\nA different response points out that, on these accounts, the concept\nof action itself turns out to be normative in a covert way, for, on\nthese accounts, it is of the essence of action that it aim at\nself-knowledge, or that it must accord with norms of practical reason.\nBut the idea that an aim is non-optional is arguably\nnormative, as is the idea of norms of practical reason. Hence,\narguably, these accounts do not explain what normativity consists\nin. They rather change the explanandum from the nature of normativity\nto the nature of agency or action.\n4.5 Explaining Normativity via \u201cSelf-legislation\u201d\n\nOne approach, which is suggested by Kant, seeks to explain normativity\nin terms of norms that one could rationally will to serve as\nrequirements incumbent on all agents (1785 [1981]). This can be\ndescribed as a matter of self-legislation, since each person is viewed\nin effect as herself legislating these norms to serve as requirements\non all agents. On this view, as Kantians develop it, the content of\neveryone\u2019s \u201cself-legislation\u201d must be the same,\nassuming relevantly similar circumstances. For the view assumes that\nthere are standards of rational willing that constrain what anyone\ncould will to serve as requirements incumbent on all agents.\n\nWhether such an account can succeed in providing a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity depends on whether the normativity of these\nstandards of rational willing can be given a constitutive explanation.\nFor these standards are viewed as normative constraints on willing,\nand rationality here is taken to be normative. So if the nature of\nnormativity is what we are trying to explain, we haven\u2019t\nsucceeded if our account rests on the assumption that there are\nnormative constraints on willing.\n4.6 Explaining Normativity via Categorical requirements\n\nA similar problem arises for attempts to explain normativity in terms\nof the idea of a categorical requirement of rationality. There is a\nstandardly accepted distinction between hypothetical requirements and\ncategorical ones (Kant 1785 [1981]). Hypothetical requirements\nare, roughly, requirements that are grounded in, or hold in virtue of,\nthe contingent desires or attitudes of the agent who is so required.\nAn example might be the requirement to maintain your car, which\npresumably presupposes that you want your car to continue running.\nCategorical requirements have no such presupposition. It might seem\nthat any genuinely robust normative requirement would be categorical,\nsince all other requirements depend on, and so are hostage to, facts\nabout person\u2019s contingent psychology.\n\nThe challenge is to explain the nature of, and the grounding of, these\ncategorical requirements. If we try to explain this in terms of what\none could rationally will to serve as requirements incumbent on all\nagents, or in terms of what one could rationally will everyone to do,\nwe run up against the same problem as afflicted the account that\ninvokes the idea of self-legislation, which we just discussed. A\nnormative naturalist might propose a naturalistic explanation of\ncategorical requirements but would need to take a very different\napproach (see Copp 2015)\n4.7 Explaining Normativity via Natural function\n\nThere are at least the following two \u201ckinds of goodness\u201d\nthat seem to be naturalistically unproblematic, and, generalizing,\nthere seem to be two kinds of naturalistic normativity. First, where\nK is a functional kind, a good K is one that\nperforms the function well. A good toaster does well at toasting\nbread. A good printer is one that prints well. And the criteria for\nperforming well are naturalistically specifiable in line with the\npurpose of the relevant kind of thing. Second, where K is a\nbiological kind, the things needed by Ks in order to flourish\nare good for Ks. Water and sunlight are good for oak trees,\nfor example. And for a K to flourish is for it to do well at\nliving the kind of life for which it is suited. It is good for a\ncheetah to be able to run fast. It is good for an oak tree to produce\nabundant acorns. These ideas have been used and extended by several\nphilosophers, including Philippa Foot (2001) and Judith Thomson (2008)\nin developing theories of normativity.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward of these theories is Foot\u2019s\nproposal that the virtues of human beings are the general\npsychological properties needed by humans to thrive in living the kind\nof life that we do. Just as it is good for a wolf to be able to fit\ninto the pack, it is good for a human to be sociable \u2013 to be\ncharitable, honest, trustworthy, and so on. For Foot, the virtues are\ngrounded in the distinctive kind of life human beings have, which is\nnot to say they are grounded in our species membership. Any agent that\nlived this kind of life would have the same virtues, regardless of the\nagent\u2019s species. So, for Foot, human goodness is merely\nanalogous to the good for the wolf and the cheetah. For Paul\nBloomfield, however, there is more than merely an analogy. He develops\na theory that is similar to Foot\u2019s, but one that rests on the\nnature of our species and on what members of the species need in order\nto achieve their natural function (2001, 2014, forthcoming).\n\nViews of this kind are examples of mind-independent normative realism\nand of reductive normative naturalism. They can be seen as\nneo-Aristotelian, and they have been developed chiefly, although not\nexclusively, in tandem with virtue theories. For discussion, see\nFitzpatrick 2014 as well as entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology \n and\n virtue ethics.\n\nThere are things to worry about in theories of this kind. If a person\nis thriving even though she does not have the psychological properties\nthat are generally needed in order to thrive, one might think\nshe need have no reason to change. If a person is not living in\ntypical conditions for a human, it is not clear that it would be good\nfor her to have the psychological properties that are\ngenerally needed in order to thrive. This might actually be\nbad for her.\n4.8 Explaining Normativity via Practices well-suited to address problems of normative governance\n\nPeople cannot thrive except with the help of others. We live in\nsocieties, and plausibly we need to do so in order to cope with the\nmany problems and issues we face in meeting our needs and pursuing our\nvalues, as well as to enhance our opportunities, and to allow us to\ndevote time and attention to developing our talents. This means we are\nfaced with a generic problem, the \u201cproblem of sociality\u201d,\nwhich arises because there are sources of conflict and disagreement\nthat can interfere with our ability to live successfully in societies.\nSocieties do better at coping with this generic problem when their\nmembers share a moral code that calls for them to cooperate with one\nanother, to avoid force and fraud, and, generally, and with\nqualifications, not to interfere with one another.\n\nTo the extent that we are autonomous, in a familiar sense of that\nterm, we pursue what we need, and we aim to realize our values. Yet\neach of us has a tendency to fail to be resolute in this pursuit, to\nsuccumb to temptation by immediate pleasures, to fail to give enough\nweight to future goods or to present risks. This is a generic problem,\nthe \u201cproblem of autonomy\u201d, and we do better at coping with\nit if we subscribe to a standard or a norm requiring us, roughly, to\nefficiently pursue what we need and value. If our psychology and our\nstrivings are well regulated by such a norm, we are\n\u201crational\u201d, and we enhance our autonomy.\n\nIn both of these cases, and others, there is a generic problem that we\ndo better at coping with if we (or enough of us) subscribe to norms or\nstandards with a content well-suited to addressing the problem.\nPluralist teleology begins with this idea and uses it, first, to\ndevelop an account of the truth conditions of normative propositions\nof morality (Copp 2007, 2009), prudential rationality (Copp 2007: chap\n10), and epistemology (Copp 2014), and second, to develop an account\nof normativity (Copp 2015). This account says, roughly, that normative\nfacts of a given kind are grounded in the content of the system of\nstandards that would best address the corresponding problem of\nnormative governance. This view is another example of mind-independent\nnormative realism and of reductive normative naturalism.\n\nThere are things to worry about. One might worry that this approach\nseems unable to make sense of the idea that, when morality and\nprudential rationality come into conflict, there might be something\nthat one ought to do \u201call-things-considered\u201d (Copp 2020c).\nOne might also worry that normativity is smuggled into the rankings of\nnorms on the basis of how well-suited they are to enabling us to cope\nwith a problem of normative governance. If so, the account might not\nbe a successful constitutive explanation of normativity. One might\nalso worry that the view implies that it is a contingent matter\nwhether certain unsettling moral claims are true (Copp 2020b).\n4.9 Conclusion\n\nEach of these eight strategies for explaining normativity has of\ncourse been contested. In cases in which the explanans uses\nnormative concepts, there is the objection that the account\ndoesn\u2019t explain normativity as such, but only reduces\nnormativity to one variety of normative consideration. In cases where\nthe explanans does not use normative concepts, there is the\npotential to provide an analysis of what normativity consists in.\nHowever, of course, every putative analysis invites objections. And,\nin every case where the putative analysis is substantive and\nphilosophically interesting, it can be denied with some\nplausibility.\n\nA familiar challenge is the \u201cso what\u201d challenge. So what\nif this act is required by the system of norms best suited to address\nthe problem of sociality, what is that to me? So what if sustaining my\npractical identity requires this act; what is that to me if doing this\nact would involve a great sacrifice? So what if my agency in a special\nprivileged sense depends on my performing this act; why should I care\nabout being an agent in this sense?\n\nIt is no accident that this all-purpose objection bears a family\nresemblance to Moore\u2019s open question argument. And the best\nresponses to it are similar to familiar responses to Moore. A\nsubstantive analysis of a philosophically interesting concept would\nnot be informative if it were obviously correct. And nothing\nguarantees that the best analysis of a philosophically interesting\nconcept will be obviously correct. Further, a metaphysical analysis of\nwhat the normativity of a worldly property or state of affairs could\nconsist in is not likely to be a priori. The more informative\nand interesting a putative analysis is, the less likely it is that it\nwill seem obviously correct, so the more it will seem open to\nobjection. (See entries on\n analysis\n and\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n5. Is Normativity Mind-Dependent?\n\nMany of the views just canvassed share a common theme: normativity is\nexplained in terms of the mental states, events, or attitudes of\nindividuals or collections of individuals. (We\u2019ll call these\n\u201cmental states\u201d for short.) Many other\nviews \u2013 including some of those just canvassed \u2013 think that\nthere is some important sense in which the normative facts are\nindependent of mental states. This debate can be (and often\nhas been) traced back all the way to the Euthyphro, where\nSocrates considers whether what is pious is determined by what the\ngods love, or whether it\u2019s the other way around (see Berker\n2018; Wright 1992). This debate has come to be known as the debate\nover the mind-dependence of normativity. Normative realists\nhave generally been taken to be committed to mind-independence (see,\ne.g., Shafer-Landau 2003; McGrath 2010; Enoch 2011), although we have\nattempted to remain neutral on this point by distinguishing\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d from \u201cbasic\nrealism\u201d, which is compatible with mind-dependence (see Cuneo\n2007).\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll cover arguments for and against the\nmind-dependence of the normative. But before we get there, we need to\nanswer a framing question: what precisely are we talking\nabout when we talk about the mind-dependence of the normative?\nAbove we framed this as the question of whether normativity is\nexplained in terms of mental states. But as we\u2019ll see below,\nthat formulation is not entirely clear.\n5.1 What is Mind-Dependence?\n\nFirst, what is the important scope of mind-dependence? Is the\nimportant question whether some normative facts are\nmind-dependent, or whether all such facts are? We think it is\nthe latter. Mark Schroeder claims, with regard to reasons in\nparticular, that it is uncontroversial that some reasons\nare explained by mental states \u2013 Ronnie has a reason to go to the\ndance because he loves to dance, but Bradley has a reason to avoid the\ndance because he hates dancing. What would be controversial\nis the idea that all reasons are explained by mental states;\nthis is actually entailed by Schroeder\u2019s \u201cHumean\u201d\nview of reasons (Schroeder 2007). We agree that the interesting\nquestion is whether all normative facts are mind-dependent,\nor whether, instead, some are mind-independent.\n\nWe also note, however, that there could be important questions about\nthe mind-independence of distinct normative subdomains. For example,\nthere are the questions whether all moral facts are\nmind-dependent, whether all aesthetic facts are\nmind-independent, etc.\n\nSecond, it would be good to get a clearer idea of what kind of\ndependence is involved in mind-dependence. In brief, we are going to\ntry to be as ecumenical as possible, not tying mind-dependence to any\nnarrowly defined or parochial metaphysical relation. Rather,\nmind-dependence concerns broad metaphysical dependence on the mental.\nThis is for two reasons: first, this just seems to us to be what\nimportant debate in the vicinity is about. It\u2019s not as if\nmind-dependence concerns metaphysical constitution by the mental,\nrather than reduction. Certainly advocates of the view that wrongness\nis constituted by disapproval disagree on some points with\nthose who think that wrongness reduces to disapproval. But in\ngeneral they seem to agree on an important point: that the there is\nsome kind of robust metaphysical dependence of wrongness on some\nmental state. It is our sense that this agreed-upon claim is what is\nat stake in debates about mind-dependence.\n\nThe second reason to define mind-dependence ecumenically is that this\nis the best way of making sense of the extant literature. Sharon\nStreet\u2019s body of work is an example. She describes her position\nas committing her to mind-dependence (Street 2016: 298n). But she\ndescribes it differently in different places: she writes (2012) that\nnormative truth consists in what follows from within the\npractical point of view; or (2008) that normative facts are\nconstituted by facts about the agent\u2019s judgments; she\n(2016) characterizes mind-dependence views at those on which\n\u201cthings [are] valuable ultimately because we value\nthem\u201d (emphasis added). So we should understand the defining\nrelation of mind-dependence so that it encompasses all of these\nrelations. Below, we will call this generic relation\n\u201cgrounding\u201d, for simplicity. This term is\nimperfect \u2013 grounding has become intensely theorized and\ndisputed \u2013 but we use it as a stand-in for a broad kind of\nmetaphysical dependence.\n\nFinally, we think that the relevant notion of mind-dependence rules\nout there being mind-independent normative constraints on the kinds of\nmental states that can ground normative facts. A few examples will\nexplain what we mean. Take the view that what we have reason to do is\ngrounded in what an ideally rational agent in our situation would want\nto do, where rationality is an irreducibly normative property. Or take\nthe view that value is grounded in being the appropriate object of an\nattitude such as admiration, where appropriateness is irreducibly\nnormative. Both views ground some significant set of normative facts\nin mental facts, but they also entail that other normative facts\n(facts about rationality and appropriateness, respectively) are\nnot grounded in mental states. Such views do not, on our\nreckoning, count as mind-dependent, for two reasons. First, we have\nestablished that the important question about mind-dependence is\nwhether all normative facts are mind-dependent, and these\nviews are views on which some aren\u2019t. Second, and most\nimportant, the relevant normative facts are partly grounded in other\nnormative facts that are themselves not grounded in mental\nfacts: facts about rationality or appropriateness are in the grounds,\nwhere these facts explicitly do not \u201cground out\u201d in mental\nfacts.\n\nThis leaves us, so far, with the claim that mind-dependence views are\nthose that fully ground all normative facts (or some significant\nsubset thereof) in mental facts. Yet as we\u2019ll see, even this\nformulation leaves some problems.\n\nMany have worried that the debate over mind-dependence is not a\nsignificant one. Gideon Rosen (1994) argued that the notion of\nmind-independence does not track our intuitive notion of objectivity.\nHis arguments often take the form: X-facts are a paradigm example of\nmind-dependent facts, but they depend on Y-facts, and Y-facts seem\nperfectly real and objective even though they are obviously mind\ndependent. Facts about humor, for example, may depend on what humans\nfind funny \u2013 but facts about what humans find funny are perfectly\nobjective! Other of his arguments take the form: X-facts are clearly\nobjective, but they depend on mental facts, and so are mind-dependent.\nFacts about fox terriers, for example depend causally on the\nintentions of those who bred them \u2013 but surely facts about fox\nterriers are objective!\n\nRuss Shafer-Landau points to a different kind of problem: mundane\nfirst-order normative truths depend on mental facts. Thus, if\nparticular normative facts are mind-dependent just when they depend on\nmental facts, and if we don\u2019t distinguish kinds of dependence,\nit looks like many mundane first-order claims commit one to the\nmind-dependence of the relevant particular normative fact:\n\n\nWe obviously can\u2019t enter a moral assessment of an agent\u2019s\nmotivations and intentions without recourse to what is going on in her\nmind. And the moral status of an action may depend very importantly on\nhow pleased or miserable it makes others, whether it prompts feelings\nof anger or empathy, whether one who is harmed has given his consent\nto the treatment, etc. (2003: 15)\n\n\nThis problem has been discussed by, for example, Enoch (2011:\n2\u20133), Rosati (2018), and Morton (forthcoming). The problem is\nthat mind-dependence is not something that should be an entailment of\nmundane first-order moral claims that, presumably, would be accepted\nby theorists on both sides of the debate about mind-dependence.\n\nAs it stands, this problem can be solved by appeal to our earlier\nclarification: the claim worth arguing about is whether all\nnormative facts (or at least all moral facts) are mind-dependent. As\nlong as there are some moral facts that don\u2019t depend on mental\nfacts, Shafer-Landau\u2019s point shouldn\u2019t worry us.\n\nThere is, however, a related, although perhaps more subtle point, that\narises for certain ethical theories. Utilitarianism, for example,\nentails that all particular moral facts depend on mental facts about\nhappiness and unhappiness. This means that \u2013 assuming a normative\nfact is mind-dependent just when it depends on mental\nfacts \u2013 utilitarianism is by definition a theory on which all\nparticular moral facts are mind-dependent. (The theory does not imply\nthat the fact that it itself is true is mind-dependent.) But surely it\nwould be a mistake to think that utilitarianism implies that all\nparticular moral facts are mind-dependent in the sense at issue in\nmeta-ethical debate about realism! And utilitarianism is not unique.\nMany other moral theories hold that that which makes right actions\nright (and good actions good, etc.) is purely mental. Consider a view\non which all moral evaluations depend on the intentions of the actor,\nfor example. So we need a solution to this puzzle \u2013 an account of\nthe nature of mind-dependence (in the sense relevant to the\nmeta-ethical debate) that doesn\u2019t commit such theories one way\nor the other on whether particular moral facts are mind-dependent (in\nthat sense).\n\nThis is a puzzle about the very notion of mind-dependence. One\nsolution would be Shafer-Landau\u2019s (2003: 15): he suggests that\nmind-dependence is ultimately a matter of how \u201cthe moral\nstandards that fix the moral facts\u201d are \u201cmade true\u201d.\nWe could parlay this into a general account of the mind-dependence of\nnormative facts in the following way: a particular normative fact is\nmind-dependent when the normative principle that governs its grounding\nin the non-normative is mind-dependent. And a principle is\nmind-dependent when it is grounded in mental facts. This solution\nallows mundane first-order claims to make no commitment on the issue\nof mind-dependence. The important question regarding the\nmind-dependence of a particular normative fact will be what explains\nor grounds the connection between, for example, causing\nunhappiness and being wrong. For example, is the principle of utility\nonly true because I believe it or because of some other mental fact?\nIf so, the principle is mind-dependent, and this mind-dependence is\ninherited by the fact that my act is wrong.\n\nAnother way to solve the problem would be to be pluralists about the\nkinds of mind-dependence that could be relevant. Fine (2012)\nsuggested, in a broader context, that metaphysical grounding is\nfundamentally distinct from normative grounding. So perhaps when\nutilitarianism says the moral depends on the mental, it means that it\nnormatively depends on the mental, while the meta-ethical\ndebate about mind-dependence (about the moral) concerns the claim that\nthe moral metaphysically depends on the mental. This is a\nsuggestion that has not been fully explored yet (though it is\ndiscussed in Berker (2018), Enoch (2019) and Morton\n(forthcoming)).\n\nEither proposal would solve the problem with utilitarianism. If\nmind-dependence (in the sense relevant to the meta-ethical debate\nabout realism) is a matter of whether normative principles are\ngrounded in mental facts, then utilitarians are free (as far as their\nutilitarianism goes) to endorse either the mind-dependence or the\nmind-independence of the moral. Utilitarianism just says that the\nparticular moral facts are grounded in mental facts, but does\nnot commit one way or the other on the grounding of the Principle of\nUtility. Similarly, if mind-dependence is a matter of\nmetaphysical (as opposed to normative) grounding of\nparticular facts in the mental, then utilitarianism can (and should)\nbe read as the claim that moral facts are normatively\ngrounded in happiness facts. Utilitarianism is silent on the further\nclaim that moral facts are metaphysically grounded in\nhappiness facts (or any mental facts whatsoever), which leaves it open\nto the utilitarian to either affirm or deny the mind-dependence of\nmoral facts \u2013 i.e., to either affirm or deny mind-independent\nmoral realism.\n\nThe puzzles around mind-dependence remain not fully explored, and it\nseems to us that more work is needed here. Nevertheless, we will press\non now to consider arguments for and against the mind-dependence of\nthe normative (or in some cases, the moral in particular). For\nsimplicity, however, we will continue to talk about mind-dependence as\nconcerning whether normative facts are grounded in mental facts. We\nwill not attempt to cash this out in terms of either or both of the\nabove more nuanced accounts.\n5.2 Arguments for Mind-Dependence\n\nWe will cover four main arguments for the mind-dependence of (some\nsignificant subdomain of) the normative. The first is an\nepistemological argument. The general form of that argument is as\nfollows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nBut we do have substantive normative\nknowledge.\nTherefore, normative facts are mind-dependent.\n\n\nThe \u201csubstantive\u201d qualifier is here because, even\naccording to those who embrace\n premise (1),\n we could have knowledge of \u201cnon-substantive\u201d claims such\nas \u201cEither Bob\u2019s act was wrong or it wasn\u2019t\u201d.\nDefining substantiveness more precisely is hard, but we could focus on\nthe important case of (knowledge of) atomic normative truths.\n\nPremise (2)\n of the argument is taken as given by those who advance this argument,\nbut of course some would deny it.\n Premise (1)\n might seem strange, since we have substantive knowledge of many kinds\nof facts that surely are mind-independent, such as facts about the\nstars. But (1) is intended as a claim specifically about knowledge of\nnormative facts. The claim is that there is something about the\nnormative such that we could not have knowledge of facts of\nthis kind if they were mind-independent. The claim has been\nsupported in a variety of ways. Some have followed Benacerraf and\nField\u2019s formulation of a problem for mathematical Platonism\n(Benacerraf 1973 and Field 1989). Enoch (2011: ch. 7) and Setiya\n(2012: ch. 2) both take this to be a main epistemological worry for\nrealism. The argument is roughly that if normative facts were\nmind-independent, there would be no explanation of the reliability of\nour substantive normative beliefs \u2013 which would undermine our\nsubstantive normative knowledge. Some think that there could be no\nsuch explanation because normative facts do not (and cannot) cause\nanything. It is controversial, however, whether normative facts ever\nhave causal impact on anything. (See sec 3.2 of entry on\n moral skepticism\n and the extensive literature on moral explanations, including Harman\n1977 and Sturgeon 1985.)\n\nOf far more popularity recently are evolutionary debunking arguments\n(or \u201cEDAs\u201d), which aim to establish (1) by way of\ngenealogical arguments. (However, see White (2010) for discussion of\nnon-evolutionary genealogical arguments.) The basic form of an EDA is\nas follows:\n\nIf normative facts were mind-independent and evolution\nhad influenced our normative faculties in such-and-such a way, then we\nwould not have substantive normative knowledge.\nEvolution has influenced our normative faculties in\nsuch-and-such a way.\nTherefore, if normative facts were mind-independent,\nthen we would not have substantive normative knowledge.\n\n\nSharon Street (2006), Richard Joyce (2006: ch. 6), and Allan Gibbard\n(2003: ch. 13) all present early versions of this argument, though it\nhas spawned an extensive literature. The argument is typically aimed\nat moral realism, but it is clear that mind-independence is the tenet\nof realism that is supposed to be causing the problem. (This is\nexplicit in various places, e.g., Street 2006: 110). However, it could\ncertainly be argued that it is not mind-independence in general that\ncauses the problem, but non-naturalistic views in particular (see the\ndebate between Street 2008 and Copp 2008). We\u2019ll put that debate\naside for now and present the argument according to most of its\nproponents\u2019 view of it \u2013 that it targets mind-independence\nin general.\n\nDifferent kinds of support have been offered for the first premise of\nthe EDA \u2013 it could be that mind-independence and evolutionary\ninfluence would mean it would be a huge coincidence if our\nnormative beliefs were true, and that fact undermines our normative\nknowledge. (Street 2006; see also Bedke 2014, though Bedke\u2019s\nobjection is against non-naturalism in particular). Or perhaps\nevolution would mean that beliefs about mind-independent normative\nfacts would be insensitive: we would have those beliefs\nregardless of whether they were true. Shafer-Landau (2012) presents a\ngood overview of different arguments here.\n\nA third argument for mind-dependence relies on claims about the nature\nof reasons. Bernard Williams (1979) famously argued that in order to\nhave a normative reason to act, I must have some motive that will be\nfurthered by my so acting. This has been called \u201creasons\ninternalism\u201d. Humean theories of reasons claim that in order to\nhave a reason to act, I must have some desire that is furthered by so\nacting. Such claims are mere necessitation claims, but could be\nleveraged as an argument for mind-dependence. For, one might claim,\nthe fact that having a relevant desire is a necessary condition of\nhaving a reason could be easily explained on the basis that\nreasons \u2013 or the relevant domain of normative facts \u2013 are\ngrounded in or explained by the relevant motives or\ndesires, as in Schroeder (2007). (Of course, this superficial reading\nwould have to be more nuanced based on our reading of the nature of\nthe mind-dependence debate.) Mind-independence theories of reasons, it\ncould be argued, have a harder time explaining reasons internalism, or\nHumean theories of reasons.\n\nFinally, some have argued against the mind-independence of the moral\nby appeal to fundamental moral disagreements. These are moral\ndisagreements that would survive some set of idealizing conditions\nlike full non-normative information and full rationality. Mackie\n(1977) himself thought that moral disagreement undermined the\n\u201cobjectivity\u201d of morality \u2013 which, for our purposes,\ncan be equated with mind-independence \u2013 but because Mackie thought\nmoral talk was committed to objectivity, he concluded that there are\nno moral facts. Michael Smith (1994: 6) argues that if moral facts are\nobjective, then moral opinions should converge under ideal conditions:\nthus fundamental moral disagreement would undermine objectivity.\n\nMind-independence theorists could accept this and argue that\nfundamental moral disagreement is not actual or possible (depending on\nwhether the objection is about actual or merely possible fundamental\ndisagreement). Alternatively, mind-independence theorists could deny\nthat fundamental moral disagreement undermines mind-independence\n(Shafer-Landau 2003: ch 9; McGrath 2010). They could point out that\nthere is fundamental disagreement in other domains, such as physics or\nhistory, yet we do not take this to undermine objectivity-claims in\nthose domains. But some, such as Richard Rowland (2017), argue that\nmoral disagreement is relevantly different from disagreement in other\ndomains.\n5.3 Arguments for Mind-Independence\n\nWe will consider two main arguments for the mind-independence of the\nnormative. First is a recent argument by David Enoch for the\nmind-independence of morality (2011: ch. 2). Enoch argues that when we\nare in certain kinds of interpersonal conflict with someone else, to\nthe extent that that conflict is due to preferences, or attitudes, or\ndesires (etc.), we should not stand our ground but should stand back\nfrom our own position and seek some sort of impartial, egalitarian\nsolution to the conflict. For example, if two friends want to do\nsomething fun, and one wants to go to the movies while the other wants\nto play video games, neither should insist on their position over the\nother\u2019s without budging. (Maybe they should flip a coin.) Enoch\ncalls this constraint \u201cImpartiality\u201d.\n\nYet, Enoch argues, this entails that on many mind-dependence theories,\nwe should find a way of compromising in the same way, when we have a\nmoral disagreement. This is easiest to see on the view that our moral\njudgments simply report mental states, which Enoch calls\n\u201cCaricatured Subjectivism\u201d. On Caricatured Subjectivism,\nour moral disagreements just are disagreements about mental\nstates, and so should be governed by Impartiality. Enoch argues that\nthe same result follows on any theory that grounds moral truth in\nmental states: on such views, we ought to find some way of\ncompromising when we have a moral disagreement.\n\nThis, Enoch argues, is a morally odious entailment: in many moral\ndisagreements, it is not only permissible but required that\nwe stand our ground. Imagine \u2013 to use Enoch\u2019s\ncase \u2013 disagreeing with someone about whether a dog\u2019s pain\ncounts, morally speaking. And imagine you then have to decide on a\nparticular case, for example, on whether to cause a dog serious pain,\nabout which you also disagree. Should you split the difference and\ncause just a small amount of pain, or flip a coin, or pursue some\nother compromise? No, Enoch argues: you should stand your ground. In\nthis way, moral disagreements are analogous to (non-moral) factual\ndisagreements and unlike conflicts of conative attitudes.\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument has its limitations, as he admits. His argument\nassumes that, on a given mind-dependence view, when two agents\ndisagree morally, their disagreement reduces to or is relevantly\nanalogous to a disagreement of conative attitudes. But if you have a\nview on which all moral agents necessarily share certain attitudes,\nthus entailing that certain moral truths are necessary, then all or at\nleast many moral disagreements will not be relevantly analogous to a\ndisagreement of conative attitudes. Hence mind-dependence views of\nthese kinds avoid Enoch\u2019s objection since his argument does not\nshow that disagreements, as understood by such theories, are governed\nby Impartiality. (Similarly, cultural relativism, \u201cno\npriority\u201d views, and any view which gives an irreducibly\nnormative constraint on which mental states can ground moral facts,\nalso avoid Enoch\u2019s objection, according to Enoch.)\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument also has the limitation that it only applies to\nmorality, rather than mind-dependence views of normativity in general.\nThis limitation appears on the face of the argument, since it relies\non the premise that it is morally objectionable not to stand\nour ground in some moral disagreements. It does not seem\nequally objectionable in any sense to compromise in cases of\nepistemic, or aesthetic, or prudential disagreements (though maybe the\ncase could be made in some or all of these domains).\n\nA second argument, or class of arguments, depends on what Sharon\nStreet (2009) calls ideally coherent eccentrics (ICEs):\ncharacters who have some intuitively bad motive (or desire, or belief,\netc.) that survives some idealization process. What process is\nrelevant will depend on the particular mind-dependence view under\nconsideration, but the idea is that some ICEs will survive any\nplausible idealization process. Generally, we can say that they have\nsome objectionable mental state that coheres both with their other\nrelevant mental states, and with the non-normative facts. The outcome,\nin abstract terms, is that for any given view of normativity\nV on which normative fact N for agent A is\nfully grounded in mental fact M, there is some ICE for whom\nM obtains, and thus N obtains for that ICE on\nV, but it is intuitively clear that N does\nnot obtain for that ICE. So we should reject V.\n\nThe strategy can be illustrated by a concrete example. Allan Gibbard\ntalks about the infamously cruel Roman emperor Caligula, and imagines\nthat he wants to torture for fun while harboring no conflicting\nattitudes (1990: 145). The argument is, then, that Caligula plainly\nwould be wrong to torture just for fun despite the fact that his\ndesire to torture for fun is coherent with his other attitudes and\nresistant to change under any idealization process. So the wrongness\nof his torturing for fun is not grounded in his actual attitudes nor\nis it grounded in the attitudes of his that would survive some\nidealization process.\n\nThe argument from ICEs has some shortcomings. First, it seems only to\nstrike against theories according to which specific moral facts\nconcerning specific agents are grounded in the attitudes or idealized\nattitudes of those agents. Second, recall that, for reasons we\nexplained before, we take the debate about mind-dependence to concern\nwhether normative principles are fully metaphysically\ngrounded in mental facts. The example of Caligula, and similar\nexamples found in Parfit (2011: ch 2, sec 11), Williams (1989 [1995:\n39]) and Hume (1739\u201340: Book 2, Part 3), are not on point, for\nthey all concern an agent with a specific mental profile and a\nspecific moral claim involving that agent. The interesting question is\nwhether we can use the basic idea of ICEs to develop analogous\nobjections to views that fully ground normative principles in mental\nfacts.\n\nMind-dependence theories differ from one another in various ways. Yet\nthe ICE strategy can perhaps be modified in ways that would allow it\nto strike against a wider variety of mind-dependence theories, and\nperhaps against all such theories. For example, ICE strategy is on its\nface not aimed at views like cultural relativism, which would\nnevertheless still count as a mind-dependence view on our definition.\nBut we can easily conceive of ICE-analogues at the cultural level:\nassume the relevant relativistic view is that moral facts for\nA are grounded what A\u2019s culture believes. We\ncan imagine A\u2019s culture believing, without internal\ninconsistency, that genocide is morally commendable \u2013 but it\nclearly is not. Again, the ideally coherent Caligula wants to torture\nfor fun and has no conflicting desires. This will entail that he has a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun on the view that decisive reasons\nare grounded in desires (at least when those desires don\u2019t\nconflict with any others). Or take the view that believing one has\na reason to X engenders a reason for one to X.\nWe can then imagine that Caligula believes he has a reason to torture\nfor fun. Combining this particular mind-dependence view with the\nmodified Caligula example entails that Caligula has a reason to\ntorture for fun. Nothing seems to suggest that any particular\nmind-dependence view is going to escape criticism. And,\nmind-independence proponents will argue, the only way we can account\nfor the facts that Caligula is wrong to torture for fun and lacks a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun is by allowing that some normative\nfacts are fully mind-independent.\n\nIt is open to any given mind-dependence theory to argue that it does\nnot have the morally objectionable entailment suggested in\nthe ICE argument. Perhaps the theory could argue that it\u2019s\nimpossible for the relevant mental state not to be in conflict with\nother relevant mental states, or the non-normative facts \u2013 maybe,\nthat is, it is impossible for the ideally coherent eccentric\nin question to exist. On the other hand, mind-dependence theorists\ncould argue, as Sharon Street (2009) does, that the ICE could exist,\nand that the relevant normative entailments do obtain \u2013 but that\nthey are not problematic. That is, for instance, perhaps the ideal\nCaligula really does have a reason to torture for fun\n\nMind-dependence theorists could try to take the edge off these\nentailments. Taking the case of reasons as an example, they could\nargue, as Williams (1989 [1995: 39]) suggested, that even though, on\nWilliams\u2019s theory, a cruel husband might have no reason to be\nnicer to his wife, we can still say that he is \u201cungrateful,\ninconsiderate, hard, sexist, nasty, selfish, brutal, and many other\ndisadvantageous things\u201d. Of course, this strategy depends on\neach of those properties not entailing that someone with that\nproperty has a reason to try to avoid it. This is tenuous at best: it\nseems doubtful at the very least to say that we have no reason to\navoid being ungrateful or sexist, etc.\n\nThe mind-dependence theorist can also consistently say that, even if\nthe ICE lacks the reasons in question, we can nevertheless force him\ninto therapy, or help his wife leave him, or try to have him arrested\n(Manne 2014). These actions don\u2019t require that the cruel husband\nhave any reasons whatsoever, but depend only on what the sympathetic\nonlooker or the wife has reason to do. But some will still find this\nunsatisfying: the husband shouldn\u2019t be acting the way\nhe is. And, of course, here the mind-independence theorist is happy to\nadvertise the benefit she can offer: the husband has a reason to treat\nhis wife better no matter what\u2019s going on in his head (or his\nheart).",
