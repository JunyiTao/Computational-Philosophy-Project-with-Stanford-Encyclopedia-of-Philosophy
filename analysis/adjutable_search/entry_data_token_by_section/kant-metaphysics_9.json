    "main_text": "God and Rational Theology || The Ontological Argument\n5.1 The Ontological Argument\n\nKant\u2019s formulation of the ontological argument is fairly\nstraightforward, and may be summarized as follows:\n\nGod, the ens realissimum, is the concept of a being that\ncontains all reality/predicates.\nExistence is a reality/predicate.\nTherefore God exists.\n\n\nKant\u2019s identification of the errors involved in this argument\nare so varied that it seems surprising that he is so often simply said\nto have argued against the use of \u201cexistence\u201d as a\npredicate. His first complaint is that it is\n\u201ccontradictory\u201d insofar as it introduces\n\u201cexistence\u201d into the \u201cconcept of a thing which we\nprofess to be thinking solely in reference to its possibility\u201d\n(A597/B625). This suggests that he thinks that in taking \u201call\nreality\u201d to mean or include \u201cexistence,\u201d the\nrational theologist begs the question, and already posits the analytic\nconnection between the concept of the ens realissimum and\nnecessary existence.\n\nAt the heart of this complaint is a more general one, to wit, that\nthere is a problem with the attempt to infer anything as\nnecessarily existing. Although, according to Kant, reason is\nunavoidably led to the notion of an absolutely necessary being, the\nunderstanding is in no position to identify any candidate answering to\nthe idea. (cf. A592/B620). Clearly, the ontological argument is\ndesigned to show that, in fact, there is one (and only one)\ncandidate answering to this idea, namely, the ens\nrealissimum. But it does so by deducing the necessary existence\nfrom the concept of the ens realissimum (a being that\ncontains all reality or predicates) only via the minor premise that\n\u201cexistence\u201d is a predicate or reality. Kant, however,\nfamously denies that existence is a \u201creal predicate,\u201d or\ndetermination. Thus, one criticism is that the argument conflates\nmerely logical with real (determining) predicates. A real\n(determining) predicate is one that enlarges the concept to which it\nis attached. It seems clear that the locus of the error here, as in\nthe other metaphysical disciplines, is the view that the idea of the\nens realissimum provides us with a concept of an\n\u201cobject\u201d to which it would be appropriate to apply\ncategories or concepts in a determining way. Thus, included in\nKant\u2019s criticism is the claim that the category of existence is\nbeing subject to a transcendental misemployment (A598/B626). This\nmisapplication of the category is problematic precisely because,\naccording to Kant, we are dealing only with an object of pure thought,\nwhose existence cannot be known (A602/B630).\n",
