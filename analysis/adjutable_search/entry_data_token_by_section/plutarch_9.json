    "main_text": "Poetics and Educational theory\n8. Influence\n\n\nPlutarch exercised considerable influence on later Platonism. His\nemphasis on the Timaeus and on metaphysics and psychology set\nthe tone for the following generations of Platonists, in which\nmetaphysical and psychological questions and the high authority of the\nTimaeus were prominent features of philosophical\ninquiry. Plutarch's literal interpretation of the Timaeus\nitself was highly debated among Platonists. It was adopted by Atticus,\nbut was resisted by most others, including Taurus, Porphyry and\nProclus. Later Platonists criticized Plutarch for a narrow-minded\ninterpretation of the Timaeus, some of their criticisms\n(e.g. on the world soul), however, rest on an uncharitable\ninterpretation of Plutarch (see Opsomer 2001). Nevertheless,\nPlutarch's view that the world soul is created in the sense that it\npartakes of reason and intelligence imparted to it by the demiurge, is\nendorsed by Alcinous, Didascalikos 169.33\u201342 and\npresumably also by Numenius (fr. 45 Des Places; see Dillon 1993, 127).\nPlutarch's radical metaphysical and psychological dualism is shared by\nNumenius and Atticus, but is rejected by Plotinus and Porphyry. The\nlatter, however, draws on Plutarch in his argument that animals\npartake of reason (De abstinentia 3.6\u20137).  Plutarch's\ntheory of divine providence and theodicy, as presented in his On\nDelays of the Divine Providence (De sera numinis\nvindicta) was influential among ancient Platonists and Christians\nalike. Proclus, for instance, took over much from it in his Ten\nObjections Against Divine Providence (esp. 8 and 9). Despite the\nvagaries of judgment by later Platonists of Plutarch's work, Plutarch\nnot only set the agenda of questions for later Platonists, redirecting\ntheir attention to the Timaeus, but he was also influential\nin terms of his interpretative strategy in approaching Plato's\nwritings, which aspired to take into account Plato's entire work and\nto treat it as a system still to be articulated. It is this strategy\nthat leads Plutarch to distinguish hierarchies of being in Plato's\nwork and also levels of ethical life, a strategy that Plotinus will\nadopt and develop. Plutarch was highly influential also among early\nChristians, who approved of his literal interpretation of the\nTimaeus, of his theory of good and bad demons, and of his\neducational theory. His work was used by Clement of Alexandria, who\nfollowed Plutarch in writing a treatise with the title\n\u201cStromateis,\u201d but also by Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria\nand the Cappadocean Church Fathers, especially Basil (see above,\nsect. 7).\n",
