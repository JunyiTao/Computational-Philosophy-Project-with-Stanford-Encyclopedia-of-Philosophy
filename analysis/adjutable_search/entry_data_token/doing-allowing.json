The Contrast Strategy and Analysis-Independent Justifications\n\nJames Rachels (1975) provides a classic example of the contrast\n strategy.[3]\n He offers us a pair of cases\u2014in one, Smith drowns his young\ncousin in the bathtub; in the other, Jones plans to drown his young\ncousin, but finds the boy already unconscious under water and refrains\nfrom saving him. The two cases are designed to be exactly alike except\nthat the first is a killing and the second a letting die. Rachels\ninvites us to agree that Smith\u2019s behavior is no worse than\nJones\u2019s. He then concludes that killing per se is no worse than\nletting die per se, and that if typical killings are worse than\ntypical lettings die that must be because of other factors. \n\nRachels\u2019 argument depends on two claims: (1) the two cases are\nexactly alike except that one is a killing and the other a letting\ndie; (2) that there is no moral difference between the cases. Both\nthese claims have been challenged.\n\nScott Hills (2018) challenges (1). He argues that the cases are not\nproperly equalised because Jones has the ability to either kill his\ncousin or to let him die, while Smith does not have the option to\nmerely let his cousin die. Hills adds a third case in which the agent\nfinds his cousin drowning and chooses to kill him rather than let him\ndie. Hills argues that this behaviour is worse than both Jones\u2019\nletting die and Smith\u2019s killing while lacking the option to let\ndie. Hills argues that the best explanation for our intuitions about\nthis third case is that killing is worse than letting die.\n\nAlthough most people struggle to see a moral difference between\nSmith\u2019s behavior and Jones\u2019 behavior, Frances Kamm (2007)\nargues that the cases might not be intuitively morally equivalent. She\nsuggests that we test the apparent moral equivalence by asking whether\nwe could imposes the same losses on Jones and Smith, assuming these\nwere necessary to bring the child back to life. Kamm claims that it\nwould be permissible to kill Smith to bring the child back to life but\nimpermissible to kill Jones for this reason (Kamm 2007, 17). If Kamm\nis right, then there is an intuitive difference between the two\n cases.[4]\n\n\nEven if Rachels were correct that Smith\u2019s and Jones\u2019s\nbehavior is morally equivalent, we may not be able to infer the moral\nequivalence of killing and letting die in general (where other things\nare equal) from this. Shelly Kagan argues that this inference assumes\nthat \u201cif a factor has genuine moral relevance, then for any pair\nof cases, where the given factor varies while others are held\nconstant, the cases in that pair will differ in moral status\u201d\n(Kagan 1988). He claims, moreover, that this assumes the Additive\nAssumption, the view that \u201cthe status of the act is the net\nbalance or sum which is the result of adding up the separate positive\nand negative effects of the individual factors\u201d (Kagan 1988,\n259). He raises several objections to the Additive Assumption.\nFirstly, one might describe a pair of cases that are exactly alike\nexcept that one is a killing and the other a letting die, where the\nfirst intuitively seems far worse than the second. If this pair of\ncases is as good as Rachels\u2019 pair, then either the inference is\nvalid in both cases\u2014to prove the contradiction that killing is\nboth worse and not worse than letting die\u2014or it is invalid in\nboth cases. Secondly, one might raise the rhetorical question: why\naddition\u2014rather than, say, multiplication or some other\nfunction? Similarly, Kamm (1996, 2007) defends a Principle of\nContextual Interaction according to which a property can behave\ndifferently in one context than\n another.[5]\n\n\nQuinn (1989) argues that would-be counterexamples like the Bathtub\ncase involve a misunderstanding of the claim that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing harm is morally significant. This claim\nshould be understood as more about moral justification than about\nother forms of moral evaluation. Quinn thinks that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant not because there is\nsome kind of intrinsic disvalue attached to doing harm, but because\ndoing and allowing harm run up against different kinds of rights. On\nQuinn\u2019s view, the right against doing harm is stronger in that\nit takes much more to defeat or over-ride it. Thus much stronger\nconsiderations are needed to justify doing harm than to justify merely\nallowing harm (other things being equal). Suppose doing harm is much\nharder to justify than merely allowing harm (other things being\nequal). An unjustified killing and an unjustified letting die may\nstill be equally bad. Quinn illustrates this with an example: You have\na right of privacy that the police not enter your home without your\npermission. This right is easier to defeat than your right that other\nordinary citizens not enter your home without permission. Nonetheless,\nunjustified break-ins by the police are, if anything, morally worse\nthan unjustified break-ins by ordinary citizens. Quinn claims that\nthis is because \u201cmoral blame for the violation of a right\ndepends very much more on motive and expected harm than on the degree\nto which the right is defeasible\u201d (Quinn 1989, 290) \n\nSamuel Scheffler (2004) also attempts to settle the moral significance\nof the distinction between doing and allowing without offering an\naccount of the distinction. He argues that: \u201cdespite the lack of\nconsensus about which candidate is to be preferred, our practice of\ntreating one another as responsible agents requires us to make some\ndistinction of this kind\u201d (Scheffler 2004, 216).\nScheffler\u2019s paper is rich and correspondingly difficult to\ninterpret. However, the main argument seems to consist of two parts.\nIn the first part, Scheffler argues that to hold oneself and others to\nmoral requirements, one must already (a) draw a distinction between\nwhat one does and what one merely allows (or some other similar\ndistinction) and (b) treat this distinction as morally important. To\nhold oneself to moral requirements involves seeing oneself as having\nreason to act in one way rather than another. One must therefore see\noneself as an agent who is charged with the task of regulating\none\u2019s conduct in accordance with reasons. However, regulating\none\u2019s behavior is something one does, not something one merely\nallows to happen. Thus to hold oneself to a moral requirement is to\nattach a special importance to, and accept special responsibility for,\nwhat one does (Scheffler 2004, 220\u2013227). In the second part,\nScheffler argues that this distinction in moral significance needs to\nbe included in the moral requirements themselves: i.e. the set of\nrequirements we hold each other to must draw a distinction between\nwhat the agent does and what she merely allows. Scheffler argues that\nholding oneself to a set of moral requirements which require one to\nmake optimal use of our causal opportunities is unstable. Such a set\nof moral requirements would require a purely instrumental view of the\nagency of oneself and others: we assess conduct purely in terms of\nwhether it produces the optimal available outcome. However, holding\noneself and others to moral requirements involves adopting a\nnon-instrumental view of agency: (1) The reasons one has to regulate\none\u2019s conduct must be non-instrumental; (2) Holding oneself and\nothers to moral requirements involves seeing failure to live up to\nsuch requirements as meriting responses such as blame. Because whether\nblame is merited is not settled by whether it would produce the best\noutcome, this requires us to recognise non-instrumental reasons\n(Scheffler 2004,\n 227\u2013236).[6]\n\nOthers have taken an account of the nature of the doing/allowing\ndistinction to be a necessary starting point for assessing its moral\nrelevance. On this view, we cannot assess whether the difference\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant until we know what\nthat distinction is. Before discussing some prominent approaches to\nthe analysis of the doing/allowing distinction and related assessments\nof its moral relevance, we will clear the way by identifying some\nrelated distinctions that are sometimes confused with the\ndoing/allowing distinction.\n2. Distinguishing Distinctions\n\nSuppose some upshot occurs and would not have occurred if the agent\nhad behaved in some different way. The question of whether the agent\ncounts as doing or allowing may be conflated with or distorted by\nquestions that should be kept distinct from it, like the questions of\n(i) whether the agent intended the upshot, (ii) whether she could\neasily have prevented the upshot, (iii) whether she guaranteed the\nupshot or merely made it probable, and even (iv) whether the\nagent\u2019s behavior was morally objectionable. It can easily be\nseen that these do not coincide with the distinction between doing and\nallowing.\n\n(i) Consider the distinction between cases where an agent intends the\nupshot and cases where she does not. If you drive your car into\nsomeone\u2019s body, without realizing it, or because you were trying\nto avoid killing a larger number, and she dies as a result, you\nundoubtedly killed her, even if you did not intend her death.\nConversely, someone may intentionally allow a child to drown in order\nto inherit his fortune.\n\n(ii) It tends to be easier to avoid killing than to avoid letting die,\nbut this is only a tendency. Sometimes saving is easier than not\nkilling. It is easy to throw a life preserver, and it may be difficult\nto refrain from killing someone who is threatening one or who has\ntreated one appallingly. There are even cases where it is physically\ndifficult to avoid killing; as for example, where one has to hold\ntight to a tree to prevent one\u2019s (light) vehicle whose brakes\nhave failed from running into a pedestrian.\n\n(iii) Sometimes the terms \u2018making\u2019 and\n\u2018allowing\u2019 are used to suggest the difference between\nmaking certain and making possible or probable. For example, in\ndiscussions of the problem of evil, people sometimes say, \u201cWell,\nGod didn\u2019t actually make the murder occur. He just allowed it to\noccur.\u201d This is best understood as a distinction between raising\nthe probability of murder to 1 from something less than 1, on the one\nhand, and raising the probability of murder from 0 to something higher\nbut still less than 1. This is a morally significant distinction but\nit is not the distinction between doing and allowing. An agent can\nkill without guaranteeing death. For example, by adding small\nquantities of poison to her victim\u2019s meals she may bring about\nthe death, even though there was a 20% chance that the poison would\nnot kill her. On the other hand, an agent might guarantee the demise\nof a plant by failing to water it in a situation where she is the only\none who can do so.\n\n(iv) Finally, the distinction between doing and allowing harm is\nsometimes thought to have, as part of its conceptual content, a moral\nelement. This thought is rarely made explicit, but the way people are\ninclined to classify cases suggests that they are guided by it. There\nare two main difficulties with this way of drawing the line. Firstly,\nif it is true by definition that killing is worse than letting die,\nthen the question of whether killing is worse than letting die is\nsettled in a trivial, circular, uninteresting way. Secondly, there are\nobvious counterexamples to this crude account\u2014morally appalling\ncases of letting die\u2014failing to feed one\u2019s\nchildren\u2014and morally acceptable cases of killing. We have no\nhesitation talking of killing in self-defense.\n\nA more controversial question is whether the doing/allowing\ndistinction should be distinguished from another related distinction.\nSometimes harms occurs because the agent performed some action:\nbecause she pressed a switch or pushed a rock. Sometimes the harm\noccurs because the agent did not perform some action: because she did\nnot press a switch or did not push a rock. We will refer to this as\nthe action/inaction distinction. There do appear to be cases where the\naction/inaction distinction and the doing/allowing distinction come\napart. An actor might spoil a performance by failing to turn up (doing\nby inaction) (Foot 1978, 26). A potential benefactor might let a\nstarving child die by ringing up her attorney to cancel a direct debit\n(allowing by action) (Bennett 1981, 91). However, the status of these\ncases is a matter of disagreement. The relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the inaction/inaction distinction will\nbe particularly relevant in discussion of\n \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Cases. \n3. The Trolley Problem and the Doing/Allowing Distinction\n\nAt this point, it is worth discussing the relationship between the\ndoing/allowing distinction and the famous Trolley Problem. The Trolley\nProblem dates back to Philippa Foot\u2019s (1978) discussion of a\npair of examples: In the first case, a judge must choose between\nframing and killing an innocent man and allowing five innocents to be\nkilled in a riot. In the second, a trolley driver must choose between\nturning a trolley so that it runs over an innocent man attached to a\ntrack and allowing the trolley to run over and kill five innocent\npeople. Foot, claimed that it was wrong to kill in the first case, but\nnot wrong in the second. Foot noted that such cases might motivate\nsomeone to accept the Doctrine of Double Effect, which distinguishes\nbetween harm that is strictly intended and harm that is merely\nforeseen. However, Foot argues that the cases can be explained by the\ndistinction between doing and allowing harm: the judge must choose\nbetween killing one and merely allowing five to die, while the trolley\ndriver must choose between killing one and killing five. Judith Jarvis\nThomson (1986) modified the case so that it was a bystander, not the\ndriver, who had to make the choice. The difference was important,\nsince the bystander is clearly choosing between killing and letting\ndie and yet it still seems permissible to turn the trolley. This\nundermines Foot\u2019s claim that the difference between doing and\nallowing explains our intuitions about these cases. So what made the\ndifference? A considerable amount of ink has been spilled attempting\nto answer this question.\n\n22 years after putting forward the bystander version of the trolley\ncase, Thomson (2008) changed her mind and argued that the consensus\nthat it is permissible for the bystander to turn the trolley was\nmistaken. She offers the reader a third option, of turning the trolley\nonto and killing oneself. Obviously, few of us would take that option.\nIf so, she argues, we are not entitled to turn the trolley onto a\nstranger. Doing so would be like stealing someone\u2019s wallet to\ngive to charity. Thomson argues that it is still wrong to turn the\ntrolley even without the option of turning it on oneself. Fitzpatrick\n(2009) has responded to Thomson by casting doubt on the analogy\nbetween stealing money to give to charity and turning the trolley on a\nstranger rather than oneself. We know that stealing is wrong except in\nexceptional cases \u2014 and the fact that the agent would prefer not\nto donate her own money doesn\u2019t make it an exceptional case. The\nTrolley Case is exceptional, which is precisely why it has generated\nso much discussion. Fitzpatrick argues that it must be permissible to\nsacrifice others when we would not sacrifice ourselves: morality\ncannot demand such extreme self-sacrifice but nonetheless the reasons\nto minimise damage remain\n compelling.[7]\n\n\nThe bystander trolley case might seem to undermine the claim that the\ndoing/allowing distinction is morally relevant. After all, it seems as\nif it is permissible for the bystander to do harm to one person rather\nthan allow harm to five others. Derek Parfit (2017) uses the bystander\ntrolley case in this way, arguing that considering such cases shows\nthat the fact that a threat is heading towards one group of people\nrather than another gives no reason not to redirect the threat.\nHowever, as Kamm (2020) points out, even if the fact that a threat is\nheading to one group rather than another is not morally relevant in\nitself, it might supervene on other morally relevant features. Kamm\nasks us to consider a version of the trolley case where there are five\npeople on each track. The bystander must choose between killing five\nand letting five die. If not harming had no priority over not aiding,\nthen it would seem the bystander should be morally indifferent between\nthese two options \u2013 but it is clear that they are morally\nrequired not to turn the trolley from five to five. As Kamm concludes,\nit seems that, if turning the trolley is permissible, it is not\npermissible because there are no differences between turning the\ntrolley and not turning the trolley. Instead, it is permissible\ndespite these differences. \n\nAlthough the Trolley Problem is often associated with the\ndoing/allowing distinction, the two should be kept separate. First, we\nmust settle whether the doing/allowing distinction is morally\nsignificant. If it can be shown that the doing/allowing distinction is\nmorally significant, the Trolley Problem should be understood as a\nfurther challenge. To respond to this challenge one must either (a)\nappeal to some additional distinction to explain why it is permissible\nfor the bystander to turn the trolley towards five to save one, even\nthough it is not normally permissible to kill one to save five or (b)\nshow that we should abandon the intuition that it is permissible for\nthe bystander to turn the trolley. \n\nLet\u2019s turn to some candidate accounts of the doing/allowing\ndistinction, and where appropriate, the moral significance or\ninsignificance of each account. In both doing and allowing, an agent\nis responsible for or relevant to a bad upshot\u2014such as a death\nor injury\u2014in the sense that she could have prevented it. The\ncontrast is most naturally picked out by the terms \u2018doing\u2019\nand \u2018allowing\u2019, or \u2018making\u2019 and\n\u2018allowing\u2019. We will in general use the former but due to\noccasional awkwardnesses in practice, we will sometimes use the terms\n\u201cpositively relevant to an upshot\u201d and \u201cnegatively\nrelevant to an upshot\u201d for cases of \u201cdoing\u201d and\n\u201callowing\u201d,\n respectively.[8]\n4. Causing and Not Causing Not to Occur\n\nOne natural suggestion is that the agent who does harm causes it to\noccur; whereas the agent who allows harm doesn\u2019t cause it, but\nsimply fails to prevent it where she could have done\n so.[9]\n This suggestion has immediate moral implications. It seems true by\ndefinition (almost) that you can be causally responsible only for\nupshots that you cause. And it is arguably true that you can be\nmorally responsible only for what you are causally responsible\nfor.\n\nThis argument gets into trouble when we reflect on the fact that we\nare often responsible for upshots we allow: the death of the\nhouseplants or the child\u2019s illiteracy. When we notice that, in\nthese cases, the plants die or the child remains uneducated because of\nsome failure on the agent\u2019s part, it becomes clear that the\nagent does, in some sense, cause the upshots. Moreover, most widely\naccepted contemporary accounts of causation imply that some event or\nfact involving these agents causes the deaths or illiteracy. For\nexample, the counterfactual account of causation\u2014according to\nwhich (very roughly) event E causes F if and only if\nhad E not occurred F would not have occurred\neither\u2014implies that it was the agent\u2019s failure to water\nthe plants that caused the\n deaths.[10]\n John Mackie\u2019s INUS\n condition[11]\u2014according\n to which E causes F if and only if E is\na(n insufficient but) necessary part of a(n unnecessary but)\nsufficient condition for F\u2014implies that the fact that\nthe agent failed to water the plants causes the plants to\n die.[12]\n\nReflecting on this may lead us to distinguish a wide sense of\ncausation (where S causes X if and only if\nS is causally relevant to X) from a narrow sense of\ncausation. Bronner (2018) argues that an agent causes an outcome in\nthis narrower sense of causation just if his behaviour falls on the\ndoing side of the doing/allowing distinction. He argues that\nrecognising two notions of causations explains why we are inclined to\nassert both (a) the claim that the agent who merely allows harm does\nnot cause harm and (b) claims that e.g. the agent caused the house\nplant to die by failing to water it. Unfortunately, these assertions\nare explained in a way that suggests that appeal to causation will not\nhelp us defend the moral relevance of the distinction between doing\nand allowing harm.\n5. Counterfactual Accounts\n\nWe are concerned then with a contrast between two ways the behavior of\nagents is causally relevant to upshots. One suggestion is to say that\nwhen the agent is positively relevant to the upshot, the upshot would\nnot have occurred if the agent had never existed. Suppose, for\nexample, the victim dies because I push his head under water. He\nwouldn\u2019t have died if I had never existed. On the other hand,\nsuppose he is in deep water and cannot swim and I don\u2019t save\nhim. He would have drowned anyway if I had never existed. In these two\ncases, the counterfactual account draws the line in the intuitively\ncorrect way.\n\nHowever, suppose that the youngest son of a King squanders his\ninheritance and begs his elder brother, the new King, for food. The\nnew King refuses and the younger brother starves to death. If the\nelder brother had never existed, the younger brother would have\ninherited the throne and would not have starved to death. Yet, it is\nclear that the new King merely allows his brother to die and does not\nkill him (Kagan 1989, 96). \n\nThis may lead us to revise the counterfactual test and ask whether the\nupshot would have happened if the agent had not been present.\nHoward-Snyder (2002) argues that this narrower counterfactual also\nfails. She asks us to \u201csuppose an SS officer, Franz, tortures\nsomeone to death. But this is standard practice in the Gestapo. If\nFranz had stayed home with a sore throat, or if Franz had never\nexisted, his pal Hans would have done the torturing, in the same way,\nat the same time Franz did. If the counterfactual account is correct,\nthen Franz is negatively relevant to the victim\u2019s death by\ntorture. That is, Franz merely allowed the death to occur\u201d\n(Howard-Snyder 2002). Yet, it is very clear that Franz killed the\nvictim. Moreover, as Howard-Snyder points out \u201cthe fact that\nHans was waiting in the wings in no way diminishes Franz\u2019s\nwrongdoing in this case.\u201d (Howard-Snyder 2002).\n\nAlan Donagan (1977) suggests a similar account of the distinction. To\ndetermine whether the agent is positively or negatively relevant to an\nupshot, we should consider what would have happened if the agent had\nnot acted at the relevant moment, or what would have happened if the\nagent had \u2018abstained from intervening in the course of\nnature\u2019. It isn\u2019t entirely clear what we are supposed to\nimagine when we imagine this but perhaps it\u2019s that the agent is\nasleep or in a trance or in some other way unable to exercise her\nagency. Now\u2014with respect to some behavior that led to some\nupshot, we might ask: would that upshot have occurred if the agent had\nabstained from intervening in the course of nature? If it would have,\nthe agent allowed the upshot. If it would not have, then she did it\n(her relevance to the upshot is positive).\n\nBennett offers the following counterexample to Donagan\u2019s\naccount: Suppose that an alarm will go off if Henry pushes a button\nwhich requires a fairly specific movement. Henry is subject to a\nbarely controllable muscular spasm which, if allowed to run its\ncourse, would jerk his hand up, hitting the button and setting off the\nalarm. Bennett argues that on Donagan\u2019s account Henry counts as\npositively relevant to the alarms silence (as keeping it silent)\nwhereas intuitively he seems to have merely refrained from setting the\nalarm off (Bennett 1995, p.\n 113).[13]\n\n\nAfter discussing, and dismissing, a similar stream of counterfactual\naccounts, Kagan notes we may be tempted to refine the counterfactual\ntest still further. We may want to say that an agent does harm when\nthe harmful upshot would not have occurred if the given reaction had\nnot occurred. However, on this account the distinction between doing\nand allowing simply disappears. For in the classic cases of merely\nallowing harm, the harm would not have occurred if the agent had acted\ndifferently. Suppose I watch Maude drown. If I had reacted\ndifferently, if I had not refused to save her, then she would not have\ndrowned. Thus this revised test still fails to capture the intuitive\ndistinction (Kagan 1989, pp. 97\u201398).\n\nCounterfactual accounts may be used to support the claim that doing\nharm is worse than allowing harm on the grounds that, on such\naccounts, allowing harm is simply a matter of not interfering or\nletting nature take its course. The underlying thought seems to be\nthis: if something bad happens when you do not exist (or are not\npresent or are unable to exercise your agency) then you aren\u2019t\nresponsible for it. If we turn our attention to another world where\nyou do exist (or are present or able to exercise your agency), but\nwhich is otherwise exactly like the first, it seems that your\ncontribution to, and thus your responsibility for, the upshot is the\nsame. Thus we should not hold you responsible in the second case\neither. Bennett (1995) argues that this is a mistake. If some bad\nupshot occurs when you do not exist or cannot exercise your agency,\nthen you are not responsible for it. Your agency is not involved and\nthe bad upshot\u2019s occurrence implies nothing about the morality\nof your behaviour. But this is simply not true in the other cases. In\nthese cases, you could have prevented the bad upshot and did not. The\nbad upshot is a consequence of how you exercised your agency and does\nhave implications for the morality of your behaviour. \u201c Only a\nmuddle could lead anyone to think that \u2018I could have prevented\nit, but I did not\u2019 is significantly like \u2018I had nothing to\ndo with it\u2019\u201d (Bennett 1995, 119).\n6. Sequences, Action, Inaction and Positive and Negative Rights\n\nBoth Philippa Foot and Warren Quinn attempt to defend the moral\nrelevance of the doing/allowing distinction by connecting it with a\nmoral distinction between positive and negative rights. \n\nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the difference between doing and\nallowing harm is at heart a difference in the agent\u2019s\nrelationship to a harmful sequence. We are able to pick out the\nsequence leading to a harmful upshot. Foot distinguishes between\ninitiating (setting the harmful sequence going); sustaining (keeping\nthe harmful sequence going when it would otherwise have stopped);\nenabling (removing some barrier which would have brought the harmful\nsequence to a halt) and forbearing to prevent (failing to take some\naction which would have brought the sequence to a halt). Initiating\nand sustaining both count as doing harm; enabling and forbearing to\nprevent are ways of merely allowing harm. Foot is clear that, in her\nview, the doing/allowing distinction is not the same as the\naction/omission distinction. \u201c[Forbearing to prevent] requires\nan omission but there is no other general correlation between omission\nand allowing, commission and bringing about or doing. An actor who\nfails to turn up for a performance will generally spoil it rather than\nallow it to be spoiled\u201d (Foot, 1978, 26) \n\nFoot (1978, 1984, 1985) argues that the moral relevance of the doing\n/allowing distinction rests on a distinction between positive and\nnegative rights. Negative rights are rights against interference\nwhereas positive rights are rights to aid or support. Negative rights\nare, in general, stronger than positive rights: it typically takes\nmore to justify an interference than to justify the withholding of\ngoods and services. Foot connects this to her analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction by arguing that interference implies\nbreaking into an existing sequence and initiating a new one and that\ntherefore violation of a right of non-interference must involve doing,\nrather than merely allowing, harm (Foot, 1984, 284).\n\nWarren Quinn (1989) shares Foot\u2019s view that the doing/allowing\ndistinction rests on the difference between positive and negative\nrights, but offers both an alternative analysis and a deeper defense\nof the claim that negative rights are stronger than positive rights.\nWhile Foot argues that these is no necessary connection between action\nand doing or inaction and mere allowing, Quinn treats the\naction/inaction distinction as fundamental to the analysis of the\ndoing/allowing distinction. On Quinn\u2019s view, an agent is\npositively relevant to a harmful upshot when his most direct\ncontribution to the harm is an action, whether his own or that of some\n object.[14]\n His relevance is negative when his most direct contribution is an\ninaction, a failure to prevent the harm. An agent\u2019s most direct\ncontribution to a harmful upshot of his agency is the contribution\nthat most directly explains the harm. One contribution explains harm\nmore directly than another if the explanatory value of the second is\nexhausted in the way it explains the first.\n\nThe key difference for Quinn is between cases where the agent produces\nthe result by an action and cases where she produces it by an\ninaction\u2014pushing someone\u2019s head under water or refraining\nfrom throwing a life preserver. Quinn holds that we do not need\nfurther analysis of the action/inaction distinction. However, Quinn\nadds a modification to his account which means that he does not treat\nthe doing/allowing distinction and the action/inaction distinction as\nthe same. Sometimes, Quinn says, your relevance to a death can be\npositive, you can kill, in other words, even though you don\u2019t\nact. This happens, for example, when you are on a train headed towards\nsome drowning victims you wish to save when you notice someone tied to\nthe tracks ahead of you. You can stop the train but you choose not to\nin order to reach your destination. Quinn believes that you kill in\nthis case, because the train acts as your agent, taking you where you\nwant to go, and crushing the person tied to the tracks in the process.\nOn the other hand, if you had chosen not to stop the train for some\nother reason but you would have not minded had someone else stopped\nthe train, then your failure to stop the train would not have\nconstituted a killing.\n\nLike Foot, Quinn believes that the key here is the distinction between\nnegative and positive\n rights.[15]\n Doing harm involves the violation of negative rights; merely allowing\nharm involves the violation of positive rights. Since negative rights\nare more stringent than positive rights, doing harm is harder to\njustify than merely allowing harm (ceteris paribus). Quinn\nagrees with Foot that negative rights are intuitively stronger than\npositive rights. However, Quinn seeks to provide further argument by\nlinking the precedence of negative rights over positive rights with\nthe conditions for a person\u2019s body to genuinely belong to him:\n\n\n[i]n such a morality [neutral vis \u00e1 vis killing and letting\ndie] the person trapped on the road has a moral say about whether his\nbody may be destroyed only if what he stands to lose is greater than\nwhat others stand to gain. But then surely he has no real say at all.\nFor, in cases where his loss would be greater than the gain to others,\nthe fact that he could not be killed would be sufficiently explained\nnot by his authority in the matter but simply by the balance of\noverall costs. And if this is how it is in general\u2014if we may\nrightly injure or kill him whenever others stand to gain more than he\nstands to lose\u2014then surely his body (one might say his person)\nis not in any interesting moral sense his. It seems rather to belong\nto the human community, to be dealt with according to its best overall\ninterest\u2026. Whether we are speaking of ownership or more\nfundamental forms of possession, something is, morally speaking, his\nonly if his say over what may be done to it (and thereby to him) can\noverride the greater needs of others (Quinn 1989, 308\u2013309).\n\n\nTo say that one has a negative right against being harmed is to say\nthat it is (at least, prima facie) wrong to harm one unless one wishes\nto be harmed. It is crucial that we add the phrase \u201cunless one\nwishes to be harmed\u201d, since without it, the precedence of\nnegative rights wouldn\u2019t give the victim any special say about\nhis own body, because it would be just as wrong to harm him even if he\nasked to be harmed, and it would be wrong for him to harm himself. So,\nthe crucial thing is that the victim has some sort of a say about what\nhappens to himself(i.e., others are morally bound to respect his\nwishes with respect to his body to a certain extent). Quinn\u2019s\nclaim is that if there is no extent to which someone\u2019s wishes\nwith respect to his body, etc. are to be respected, then we\u2019ve\ncompletely done away with the idea of ownership of one\u2019s body,\netc. One person\u2019s wishes about what happens to her body do often\nclash with someone else\u2019s wishes about what happen to his. For\nexample, Susan wishes to marry Paul, but Paul doesn\u2019t wish to\nmarry Susan. Morality obviously cannot give all such wishes\nprecedence. So, we need to give some subset of them precedence. Quinn\nargues that we cannot give positive rights precedence over negative\nrights without\n incoherence.[16]\n And, hence, he concludes that we must give negative rights precedence\nover positive rights.\n\nHoward-Snyder(2002) has argued that Quinn\u2019s defense does not\nshow that we should endorse the distinction between doing and allowing\nrather than some alternative distinction: \u201c...there are other\nways to divide up rights than the division into positive and negative\nrights. We might divide them into the rights of children and the\nrights of adults, rights concerning the upper half of the body and\nrights concerning the lower half, etc. and then give precedence to one\nset over the other whenever they come into conflict. These seem\narbitrary and wasteful, but their rationale seems no worse than\nQuinn\u2019s. Quinn\u2019s is a funny sort of defense of negative\nrights. Unless I\u2019m missing something, it doesn\u2019t pick out\nany special feature of negative rights that makes them specially worth\nrespecting\u201d (Howard-Snyder 2002).\n\nWoollard (2013, 2015) attempts to fill this gap in Quinn\u2019s\nargument, offering a new analysis of the doing/allowing distinction\nand using the notion of imposition to link the distinction, so\nanalysed, to the conditions for genuine ownership. \n\nWoollard returns to Foot\u2019s (1978, 1984, 1985) sequence account.\nHowever, she argues that Foot\u2019s account is incomplete because it\ndoes not tell us how to distinguish enabling from sustaining, why\nenabling is grouped with forbearing to prevent, or what sustaining and\ninitiating have in common. On Woollard\u2019s view, the key question\nis whether the relevant fact about the agent\u2019s behavior is part\nof the sequence leading to harm. Woollard distinguishes between\nsubstantial and non-substantial facts. Substantial facts are by nature\nsuitable to be part of a sequence. Non-substantial facts normally\ncount as mere conditions for a sequence. Thus anything that is\nrelevant to a sequence through a non-substantial fact will normally be\na mere condition rather than part of the sequence. However,\nnon-substantial facts can count as relatively substantial and part of\na sequence under special circumstances, if for example, they are facts\nabout the absence of a barrier that belongs to the victim.\n\nThis leaves Woollard with the following account: If an agent is merely\nrelevant to a harm through a non-substantial fact about her body or\nbelongings then her behavior will be merely a condition for, rather\nthan part of, the harmful sequence. She will count as merely allowing\nharm. In contrast, if there is a complete sequence of substantial\nfacts leading from the agent to an harmful affect on what belongs to\nthe victim or a third party, her behavior will be part of the harmful\nsequence and she will count as doing harm. Woollard uses this analysis\nto connect the doing/allowing distinction and imposition. Imposition\ninvolves the needs or behavior of one person intruding upon the proper\nsphere of another. When an agent does harm, there is a sequence of\nsubstantial facts connecting her behavior to an unwanted effect on\nwhat belongs to this victim: this is a harmful causal imposition. When\nan agent is forbidden from allowing harm, she is required to make some\nsubstantial fact about her body or her belongings true for the sake of\nanother. Finally, Woollard argues that for our bodies and other\nbelongings to genuinely belong to us we require protection from both\ncausal and normative imposition: we require constraints against doing\nharm and permissions to allow harm. \n\nLike Quinn and Woollard, Frances Kamm (1996, 2007) also appeals to the\nidea of rights or entitlements. Kamm argues that letting die has two\nessential properties which can make letting die more acceptable than\nkilling: (1) the victim only loses life that he would have had with\nthe agent\u2019s help at that time; (2) the alternative is for the\nagent to be interfered with. These features make a moral difference\nbecause the victim has a stronger claim (relative to the agent) to\nwhat he has independently of that agent\u2019s current efforts. Kamm\nargues that these features are essential properties of a letting die,\nbut may also be found in some cases of killing and such killings will\nbe morally equivalent to merely letting die. \n7. The \u2018Most of the Things He Could have Done\u2019 Account\n\nJonathan Bennett thinks that the fundamental distinction between doing\nand allowing is between cases where the upshot occurs because of\none\u2019s action and cases where the upshot occurs because of\none\u2019s inaction\u2014although he prefers to replace\n\u201caction/inaction\u201d talk with \u201cpositive/negative\nfact\u201d talk (Bennett 1967, 1981, 1993, 1995). When Bennett\ndiscusses the contrast between positive and negative relevance to\nharm, he is attempting to capture a deep, philosophically interesting\ndistinction that underlies our talk of \u2018doing and\nallowing\u2019 \u2018making and letting\u2019,\u2018killing and\nletting die\u2019. He acknowledges that the correspondence between\nhis distinction and the distinctions we make in everyday life and\nlanguage may be inexact. He says that my behavior is negatively\nrelevant to an upshot if a negative fact about my behavior is the\nleast informative fact that suffices to complete a causal explanation\nof it; whereas my behavior is positively relevant to that upshot if a\npositive fact about my behavior is the least informative fact about my\nconduct that suffices to complete a causal explanation of it. For\nexample, if I jog while you drown, your drowning could be explained by\nthe fact that I jogged, but it could also be explained by the less\ninformative fact that I did not pull you out of the water.\n\nIn a nutshell, on Bennett\u2019s view, an agent\u2019s relevance to\nan upshot is positive if most of the ways she could have behaved at\nthe time would not have led to the upshot; otherwise, it is\n negative.[17]\n For example, suppose I douse a slug with salt and it dies as a\nresult. My relevance to its demise is positive, since most of the ways\nI could have behaved would not have led to the death. On the other\nhand, if it dies because I fail to move it from the path of a car,\nthen most of the ways I could have behaved at the time would have led\nto its death, so my relevance to the death is negative.\n\nMost people conclude that on this account doing harm is in itself no\nworse than allowing harm. If some upshot obtains because of the way\nyou behaved, then the fact that there were many ways (rather than only\na few) you could have behaved which would also have had that result\nmay seem obviously morally\n insignificant.[18]\n This conclusion is surprising, even shocking. Bennett\u2019s\naccount, however, does offer an alternative explanation of why we tend\nto think of killing as worse than letting die. He claims, quite\nplausibly, that it is morally worse to be causally relevant to a bad\nupshot one could easily have avoided than a similarly bad upshot one\ncould have avoided only with great difficulty. If most of the ways one\ncould have behaved would have led to an upshot, then it was probably\nsomewhat difficult or onerous to avoid the upshot; whereas if most of\nthe ways one could have behaved would not have led to an upshot, then\nit was probably fairly easy to avoid the upshot. However, on\nBennett\u2019s view when killing and letting die are equally\ndifficult to avoid, and all other factors are equal, then there is no\nmoral difference between them. Thus the doing/allowing distinction is\nnot itself morally relevant. \n\nThe two most persistent objections to Bennett\u2019s accounts are the\nImmobility Objection and the Sassan Counterexample. There are two\ntypes of Immobility Counterexample:\n\n\nImmobility 1: If Henry stays completely still, dust will settle and\nclose a tiny electric circuit, setting off an explosion which will\nkill Bill. If Henry makes any move whatsoever, the dust will not\nsettle and the circuit will not close (Quinn 1989, 295).\n\nImmobility 2: If Henry makes any move whatsoever, he will set off a\nmotion detector which will set off an explosion, killing Bill. If he\nstays completely still, the motion sensor will not go off and Bill\nwill not die (Quinn 1989, 296).\n\n\nMost ways Henry could move in Immobility 1 would not lead to\nBill\u2019s death. Thus on Bennett\u2019s account, Henry counts as\npositively relevant to Bill\u2019s death if he stays still and the\ndust settles on the circuit in Immobility 1. This conflicts with our\nintuition that Henry would merely allow Bill to die by staying still.\nOn the other hand, most ways Henry could move in Immobility 2 would\nlead to Bill\u2019s death. Thus on Bennett\u2019s account Henry is\nnegatively relevant to Bill\u2019s death if he waves an arm and sets\noff the motion sensor in Immobility 2. Again, this conflicts with our\nintuitions: intuitively waving an arm and setting off the explosion\nwould be killing Bill. As Quinn (1989, 296) notes, Bennett\u2019s\naccount also clashes with our moral intuitions. It seems permissible\nfor Henry to stay still in Immobility 1 if this is necessary to save\nfive other lives even if Bill will die, but impermissible for him to\nmove to save five others in Immobility 2 if he would thereby set off\nthe motion sensor and kill Bill. \n\nSome\n philosophers[19]\n argue that such examples refute Bennett\u2019s account because\nBennett wrongly classifies immobility as positive and motion as\nnegative. The suggestion is that immobility is incompatible with\npositive relevance to an upshot. Nifty slogan: \u2018You cannot do\nanything by doing nothing.\u2019 \n\nHowever, there are some cases which do intuitively involve doing harm\nby remaining still. In Bennett\u2019s example, Agent finds himself\nsitting on Patient\u2019s chest. If he makes any move, this will\nrelieve the pressure enough for her to breathe, but if he stays still\nshe will suffocate and die (Bennett 1995, 98).\n\nBennett attempts to explain away the intuition that immobility is\nnegative by arguing that we are misled by the fact that in most actual\nstates of affairs, for any upshot that we care about, staying still\nwill be on \u201cthe roomy side of the line.\u201d As Bennett notes:\n\u201cIt takes work to rig things so that keeping still is almost the\nonly route to some interesting upshot. Perhaps this is why, when\npeople confront a result that is produced by Agent\u2019s immobility,\nthey immediately and invalidly infer that this is a case of\nallowing\u201d (Bennett 1995, 99).\n\nBennett also suggests that our intuitions about doing and allowing are\nresponsive to two distinctions: his positive/negative distinction and\nthe active/passive distinction identified by Alan Donagan (see the\nsection on\n counterfactual accounts).\n An agent is active relative to an upshot if the upshot would not have\noccurred if the agent had temporarily lost the power of agency, i.e.\nhad been temporarily asleep or unconscious. Bennett asks us to imagine\nthat Henry finds it very difficult to stay still and he \u201csweats\nand strains\u201d against bodily spasms to do so. He suggests that in\nthis case, where both analyses agree, we will see Henry\u2019s\nbehaviour as doing. On the other hand, when the two distinctions\ndisagree, the resulting uncertainty will allow our rule of thumb (rest\nequals allowing and motion equals doing) to prevail (Bennett 1995, 99,\n113).\n\nHoward-Snyder (2002) is responsible for the second persistent\nobjection to Bennett\u2019s account. In Howard-Snyder\u2019s Sassan\ncounterexample, \u201cAn assassin, A. Sassan, is preparing to\nassassinate Victor by shooting him. A second assassin, Baxter, is\nwaiting across the street watching Sassan to ensure his success. If\nSassan shows any signs of hesitation, Baxter will shoot Victor\nhimself. Suppose Sassan knows about Baxter and his intentions and also\nknows that he can turn his gun on Baxter instead of on Victor if he so\nchooses. Although this thought crosses his mind, he quickly suppresses\nit, since he is committed to Victor\u2019s annihilation. He shoots\nVictor and Victor dies instantly.\u201d Most of the ways Sassan could\nhave behaved would have led to the shooting and death of Victor\n(either by himself or by Baxter). So it looks like Bennett\u2019s\naccount will classify Sassan as negatively relevant to Victor\u2019s\ndeath e.g. as merely letting Victor die. But as Howard-Snyder points\nout, \u201cI just said that Sassan shot Victor. He pulled the\ntrigger. The gun fired. A bullet flew out of the barrel and entered\nVictor\u2019s body. Victor died from the bullet wound. A clearer case\nof killing is impossible to find\u201d (Howard-Snyder 2002). Bennett\nmight repeat the point that positive relevance to a death is not\nexactly the same as killing. Nevertheless, insofar as we have any\npre-theoretical grip on (and interest in) the concept of positive\nrelevance to a death, Sassan\u2019s relevance to Victor\u2019s death\nmust strike us as positive rather than\n negative.[20]\n And yet Bennett\u2019s account implies that it is negative.\n\nIn response, Bennett has pointed out that the upshot that concerns us\nis not the fact that Victor died (no-one could prevent that) but the\nfact that Victor died at T (or perhaps, the fact that Victor\ndied no later than\n T).[21]\n He suggested that perhaps Sassan is positively relevant to that,\nsince most of the ways he could have behaved would have resulted in\nVictor\u2019s dying later than T. But we could, with minimal\nartifice, ensure that Baxter is disposed to kill Victor at exactly\nT if Sassan does not. For example, we could imagine that\nthere is only a fraction of a second when Victor is vulnerable to a\nbullet and that Baxter is located closer to him (or has a faster\nacting gun) so that there is a moment T2 such that\nif Sassan does not shoot at T2, he will not\nsucceed in killing Victor, but such that Baxter still has a chance to\nget a shot off at T1 with the result that Victor\nwill die at T (Howard-Snyder 2002).\n\nHoward-Snyder (2002) also explores responses which try to get the\nright result by narrowing the description of the upshot. Perhaps\nsomeone may try to argue that Sassan is positively relevant to\nsomething\u2014the fact that Victor is killed with this bullet rather\nthan that, or more simply the fact that Victor is killed by him rather\nthan by Baxter. Howard-Snyder argues that the latter suggestion will\nnot do, since it begs the question. Bennett cannot assume that his\naccount implies that Sassan kills Victor, since that is the very claim\nat issue. Howard-Snyder (2002) also dismisses the suggestion that\nSassan is positively relevant to Victor\u2019s being killed with this\nbullet rather than that, for we can modify the story in such a way\nthat if Sassan does not pull the trigger, Baxter can push a switch\nthat will guarantee that the gun\n fires.T).[22]\n8. \u2018Safety Net\u2019 Cases\n\nWhen we first describe the doing/allowing distinction, it is tempting\nto use standard doings and standard allowings of harm as examples. In\nstandard doings of harm, the agent performs some action, setting some\nphysical forces in motion which then run to the victim: Bob pushes a\nboulder which rolls down the hill and crushes Victor to death;\nBystander pulls a lever turning the trolley towards the one. In\nstandard allowing, the agent does not perform some action, refusing to\nintervene in some harmful sequence. \n\nWhat about cases where the agent removes a safety net from beneath a\nfalling victim, unplugs a respirator, kicks a rock out of the path of\nthe runaway vehicle, and other similar cases? In these cases, the\nagent performs some action but does not act on the victim directly.\nInstead, she removes some barrier to a harmful sequence. Such cases\nare now an important part of philosophical discussion of the\ndoing/allowing distinction, in part because of the recognition that\nsome apparently standard cases of doing in fact involve removing a\nbarrier. As Jonathan Schaffer (2000) has argued, in many guns, pulling\nthe trigger fires a bullet by essentially removing a barrier. \n\nThere are four main approaches to such \u2018Safety Net\u2019\nCases.\n\nUnified All Doings Accounts: The first approach treats all safety\nnet cases as doings because the upshot occurs because the agent does\nsomething. This in effect, seems to treat the action/inaction\ndistinction and the doing/allowing distinction as identical. Quinn\n(1989) and Bennett (1995) both endorse this approach to safety net\ncases.\nUnified All Allowings Accounts: The second approach treats all\nsafety net cases as mere allowings. This approach is commonly seen as\nfollowing Philippa Foot in holding that all safety net cases count as\nenabling harm (removing a barrier that would have prevented a harmful\n sequence).T).[23]\n For Foot, enabling is a species of allowing. Rickless (2011) endorses\nthis approach. \nNon-Unified Accounts: Others, such as McMahan (1993) and Woollard\n(2015), argue that some safety-net cases should be treated as doings\nand others as merely allowings. \n3rd Category Accounts: Finally, others such as Matthew Hanser\n(1999), Timothy Hall (2008) and Barry and \u00d8verland (2016), argue that\nsafety net cases cannot be classified alongside either standard doings\nof harm or standard allowings of harm. They fall into a third\ncategory. \n\n\nNon-Unified Accounts may seem attractive because there are safety net\ncases that seem like clear cases of doing harm and others that seem\nvery much like merely allowing harm. For example,\n\n\nImpoverished Village: Having given one\u2019s accountant full power\nof attorney one learns that because of a misunderstanding he is\npreparing to sign away 10% of one\u2019s income to save the lives of\npeople in a remote impoverished village. One phones to instruct him\nnot to do it (McMahan 1993,\n 258).[24]\n\nHospital: A doctor has just plugged one person into a respirator. If\nthe patient is moved or unplugged from the respirator, he will die.\nFive more patients arrive and will die unless plugged into the\nrespirator. The doctor unplugs the first patient into order to save\nthe five (Rickless 2011, 68).\n\nBurning Building (Enemy): A person trapped atop a high burning\nbuilding leaps off. Seeing this, a firefighter quickly stations a\nself-standing net underneath and then dashes off to assist with other\nwork. The imperilled person\u2019s enemy, however, is also present\nand, seeing his opportunity, swiftly removes the net so the imperilled\nperson hits the ground and dies. (McMahan 1993, 254)\n\nGallows: A innocent man is standing on a gallows with a noose around\nhis neck. The agent pulls the lever, releasing the trap door. As the\ninnocent man falls through the trap door, the noose tightens around\nhis neck, killing him. (See Vihvelin and Tomkow 2005, 194.)\n\n\nImpoverished Village and Hospital seem like clear cases of merely\nallowing harm whereas Burning Building (Enemy) and Gallows seem like\nclear cases of doing harm. The challenge for Unified All Doings\nAccounts is to explain our intuitions in Impoverished Village and\nHospital, either by arguing that our intuition that these cases count\nas allowings is misleading or by showing that these cases have some\nspecial feature which means they should not be seen as standard safety\nnet cases. Unified All Allowings Accounts face an analogous challenge\nwhen it comes to Burning Building (Enemy) and Gallows. Non-Unified\nAccounts and 3rd Category Accounts must give a convincing account of\nthe status of safety net cases which explains\u2014or explains\naway\u2014our intuitions about all such cases. \n\nRickless (2011) uses both the above-mentioned tactics to defend the\nUnified All Allowings Account. He argues that our intuitions in cases\nlike Burning Building (Enemy) are distorted by the agent\u2019s\nmalicious intentions. He suggests that if we remove the distorting\nfactor of malicious intentions, we will see the Burning Building case\nas morally equivalent to merely allowing harm (Rickless 2011,\n 71).[25]\n Thus, for example, in McMahan\u2019s original Burning Building Case,\nwhen a firefighter removes a net from beneath one imperilled person in\norder to save five others, he counts as merely allowing harm (McMahan\n1993, 262, Rickless 2011, 72). Rickless argues that this would also be\ntrue of a passerby who moved the net from beneath one to save five\n(Rickless 2011, 73). Instead of arguing that our intuitions are wrong\nabout Gallows, Rickless argues that it differs from other safety net\ncases. In Gallows, there is no pre-existing threatening sequence.\nGallows should be understood as the initiation of a harmful sequence,\nand thus as doing harm. \n\nMcMahan (1993) picks out three key factors which he claims affect\nwhether withdrawal of a barrier counts as doing or allowing\n\u201c...whether the person who terminates the aid or protection is\nthe person who has provided it, whether the aid or protection is\nself-sustaining or requires more of the agent, and whether the aid or\nprotection is operative or as yet inoperative\u201d (McMahan 1993,\n262). Withdrawal of a barrier counts as merely allowing harm if and\nonly if the barrier was (a) provided by the agent and the barrier is\neither (b) not self-sustaining or (c) not yet operative. Thus\nMcMahan\u2019s account seems to correctly classify Impoverished\nVillage and Hospital as merely allowing harm and Burning Building\n(Enemy) as doing harm. It may, however, counterintuitively classify\nGallows as merely allowing harm if the trap door belongs to the agent.\nIf the trap door belongs to the agent, the continued use of his\nresources is required to keep the barrier in place, so the barrier may\nnot count as self-sustaining. McMahan also allows that sometimes one\nagent can act on behalf of another, or they can act as a team. This is\nsupposed to explain the intuition that in the Burning Building case\nwhere the net is moved to catch five imperilled persons instead of\none, it doesn\u2019t matter whether it is the original firefighter or\na second firefighter who does the\n moving.[26]\n\n\nMatthew Hanser (1999), Timothy Hall (2008) and Barry and \u00d8verland\n(2016) all argue that safety net cases should not be classified as\neither doing or merely allowing harm. They fall into a third category.\nHanser argues that this third category is \u2018preventing people\nfrom being saved\u2019 and it is conceptually distinct from both\ndoing and allowing harm, but morally equivalent to merely allowing\nharm, other things being equal. Other things are not equal i.e.\npreventing someone from being saved is worse than merely allowing harm\nif the resources the victim needs in order to survive do not belong to\nthe agent. The moral implications of Hanser\u2019s account are thus\nsimilar to those of McMahan\u2019s account.\n\nHall argues that safety net cases belong to the category\n\u2018denials of resources\u2019 which are both conceptually and\nmorally distinct from standard doings and standard allowings. Hall\noffers three main arguments. First, he argues that previous analyses\nhave failed to show that allowing harm by denying resources has\nanything significant in common with allowing harm by failing to act.\nSecond, he argues that the moral status of denials of resources depend\nto a large extent on which person has a right to the resource in\nquestion while the moral status of standard doings and standard\nallowings does not. Third, he argues that constraints against standard\ndoings of harm and permissions for standard allowings of harm are\nrooted in pre-political personal rights but constraints and\npermissions regarding denials of resources are not. \n\nOn Barry and \u00d8verland\u2019s view, safety net cases count as\nenablings. When an agent enables harm, there is a \u2018relevant\naction\u2019 (\u201cthere is an answer to the question of how she\nwas relevant to [the harm] that refers to something she did\u201d\n\u2013 see Barry and \u00d8verland 2016, 116) but the action is not\nconnected to the harm through a complete causal process. Barry and\n\u00d8verland argue that an agent can be expected to bear greater costs to\navoid doing harm than to avoid enabling harm, but greater costs to\navoid enabling harm than merely allowing harm.\n9. Letting Yourself Do Harm\n\nRecent work raises another important challenge for defenders of the\nDoctrine of Doing and Allowing (see Persson 2013 and Hanna 2014,\n2015). The challenge is to provide an account of the moral status of\nallowing oneself to do or to have done harm. Consider: \n\nPoisoner: Earlier this morning, Agent deposited a dose of lethal\npoison into a teapot from which one person drinks tea at the same time\neach afternoon. Unless Agent warns her potential victim now, he will\ndrink the tea and\n die.[27]\n\nSpasm: Agent feels the onset of a spasm in her finger. If she does not\nrepress the spasm, her finger will contract around the trigger,\nsetting off a gun, killing Vic (Persson 2013, 96).\n\nAs Hanna points out, failure to warn the potential poison victim would\nnot be killing, instead Agent would be failing to prevent her past\nbehavior from constituting killing (Hanna 2014, 679). She would be\nallowing herself to have killed. Similarly, failure to repress the\nspasm seems significantly different from normally killing. It is\nperhaps best characterized as letting oneself (non-intentionally) kill\n(Persson 2013, 96).\n\nPersson suggests that deciding the moral status of allowing oneself to\nhave done harm requires us to choose between a\n\u201cpresent-self-focus\u201d, which gives primary importance to\nwhat you do now, and a \u201cself-other divide\u201d, based on the\ndifference between your own agency and agency that is external to you\n(Persson 2013, 102\u2013103). He argues that the neither of these is\nsatisfactory. The present-self focus is mysterious: \u201cwhy should\nwhat we are doing at the present time have this special\nimportance?\u201d (110). The self-other divide has \u201can air of\nrepulsive moral self-indulgence\u2026 why be especially concerned\nabout your own rights violations rather than the rights-violations of\nall people, in proportion to the stringency of the rights\nviolated?\u201d\n (110).[28]\n Persson has similar worries about holding that letting yourself kill\nnow is harder to justify than \u201cmerely\u201d letting die, even\nwhen the killing would not be intentional under any description. We\nmust place a lot of weight on whether a natural or non-intentional\ncause of death is external or internal to us. Persson challenges this\nidea: \u201cThe fact that a twitch is internal rather than external\nto us cannot make any moral difference\u201d (Persson 2013, 105).\n\nHanna\u2019s discussion of cases suggests that intuitively allowing\noneself to have done harm is neither morally equivalent to doing harm\nnor morally equivalent to merely allowing harm. Normally, if we face a\nchoice between merely allowing harm to one and merely allowing the\nsame harm to five, we should allow harm to one. However, if Agent\nfaces a choice between warning her potential poison victim and saving\nfive others from drowning, then intuitively, she is morally required\nto save the one potential poison victim. This suggests that allowing\noneself to have done harm is not morally equivalent to merely allowing\nharm (Hanna 2014, 678\u20139). If we face a choice between doing harm\nto one and doing the same harm to five, we should do harm to the one.\nBut suppose that Agent can give her warning and prevent the poisoning\nonly by driving down a narrow mountain path, which is blocked by the\nbody of an innocent, unconscious person. It seems impermissible for\nher to do so even if there are five people about to drink from the\npoisoned teapot. This suggests that allowing oneself to have done harm\nis not morally equivalent to doing harm (Hanna 2014, 681). This\nexacerbates the challenge for defenders of the Doctrine of Doing and\nAllowing for they must find a justification for treating the fact that\nthe Agent will be allowing herself to have done harm as somewhat\nmorally significant but not as so morally significant that it renders\nher current behaviour morally equivalent to doing\n harm.[29]\n In Persson\u2019s terms, we seem to need to defend both the\nself-other divide and the present-self-focus.\n\nThe cases from the literature on letting oneself do harm may seem\ncontrived. This may lead one to think that accounting for such cases\nis not a central issue for an account of the doing /allowing\ndistinction. Charlotte Franziska Unruh (2021) argues that such cases\nof letting oneself do harm are merely a subset of cases involving\ncomplicated causal chains where the agent is relevant to harm in more\nthan one way. Moreover, she argues, such cases arise frequently in\ncases involving future generations, for example, when we must make\ndecisions about whether to mitigate climate change resulting from our\npast carbon dioxide emissions.\n10. X-Phi and the Doing/Allowing Distinction\n\nThe majority of work on the doing/allowing distinction has appealed to\nthe author or reader\u2019s own intuitions about cases. However, some\nwork has used experimental data in relation to the doing/allowing\ndistinction. This is part of a wider phenomenon of use of empirical\ndata in philosophy known as \u2018X-Phi\u2019. \n\nKahneman and Tversky\u2019s (1983) experiment asked respondents to\nchoose between treatment plans for a deadly disease expected to kill\n600 people. The first set of respondents must choose between:\n\nOption (A): 200 people will be saved.\nOption (B): There is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be\nsaved and a 2/3 probability that no one will be saved.\n\n\n72% of people prefer (A) and 28% of people prefer (B). The second\ngroups of respondents were asked to choose between:\n\nOption (C): 400 people will die.\nOption (D): There is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and a\n2/3 probability that 600 people will die.\n\n\nThis time, 22% preferred C and 78% preferred D.\n\nThe results are striking because (A) is the same outcome as (C) and\n(B) is the same outcome as (D). The outcomes are simply described\ndifferently.\n\nKahneman and Tversky (1984) argue that such experiments show that we\nattached greater disvalue to a loss than to the absence of a gain (a\nno-gain). Different descriptions of the same outcome lead to different\nresponses by changing the baseline, affecting whether the outcome is\nperceived as a loss or a no-gain. These results may seem to threaten\nthe relevance of the doing/allowing distinction: first by suggesting\nthat the intuitions that supported the doing/allowing distinction can\nbe explained by the loss/no-gain preference; second, by undermining\nthe reliability of these intuitions. See Sinnott-Armstrong (2008);\nHorowitz (1998).\n\nHowever, as Kamm (2007) argues, the doing /allowing distinction seems\nto be intuitively morally relevant independently of the loss/no-gain\ndistinction. Imagine I am driving five healthy people to hospital to\nreceive anti-venom against the plague of poisonous snakes that will\nhit town and kill all unprotected people in a few hours; I will not\nreach the hospital in time unless I drive over the one healthy person\nwho is blocking my road. It seems intuitively impermissible for me to\nkill the one to save the five \u2013 even though all victims face\nlosses. \n\nKamm (2007) also argues that the correct application of the\ndoing/allowing distinction is not affected by framing effects: except\nin cases of overdetermination, the correct baseline for the\ndoing/allowing distinction is determined by what would happen if the\nagent did not intervene. Colombo (2018) argues that Kamm\u2019s\nassurance depends upon prior acceptance of a particular account of the\ndoing/allowing distinction. Nonetheless, Colombo argues, this need not\nundermine our appeal to intuitions in support of the doing/allowing\ndistinction: our intuitions may be generally trustworthy even if\nborderline cases are subject to framing effects.\n\nCushman et al (2008) claim that their experimental data shows that\nmoral appraisals affect classification of behaviour as doing or\nallowing. Cushman et al do not see this as presenting a special\nchallenge for the doing/allowing distinction. They see these findings\nas adding to \u201ca growing list of folk concepts influenced by\nmoral appraisal, including causation and intentional action\u201d\nconcluding that: \u201cthe present finding favors the view that moral\nappraisal plays a pervasive role in shaping diverse cognitive\nrepresentations across multiple domains\u201d (Cushman et al 2008,\n281).\n\nBarry et al (2014) use empirical studies to support the 3rd\ncategory approach to safety net cases. They argue that empirical\nstudies show that removing a barrier to harm (enabling) is treated as\na distinct category, both morally and conceptually distinct from doing\nand allowing. Most philosophical work on the doing/allowing\ndistinction seeks to reflect something that is claimed to be part of\ncommonsense morality while noting that common intuitions about\nparticular cases could be incorrect. Given this, there are interesting\nquestions about how to respond to such empirical studies: does the\nfact that enabling is treated as a distinct category settle whether it\nis a distinct category for the purposes of the defender (or critic) of\nthe doing/allowing distinction? \n11. Conclusion\n\nThe early critics of the doing/allowing distinction focus on appealing\nto intuitions to cast doubt on the claim that commonsense morality\nattributes significance to the doing/allowing distinction. Rachels\n(1975) and Tooley (1972) offer contrast cases in which all other\nfactors are held constant and killing and letting die seem morally\nequivalent. Kamm (2007) and Frowe (2007) respond by arguing that we do\nnot treat these cases as morally equivalent, while Kagan (1988) and\nQuinn (1989) challenge the inference from the moral equivalence of the\ncases described to the general equivalence of doing and allowing in\ngeneral.\n\nThe next wave of critics argues that no account could both provide an\nanalysis of the distinction that matched our intuitive understanding\nof the distinction and was morally relevant (Bennett 1995, Kagan\n1989). Quinn(1989), Woollard (2015) Kamm (1996), amongst many others,\nattempt to respond to this challenge.\n\nRecent work has produced new challenges about how to account for the\nremoval of barriers (McMahan 1993, Rickless 2011, Hanser 1999, Hall\n2008), past behaviour (Persson 2013, Hanna 2014, 2015) and the\nsignificance of empirical research (Kahneman and Tversky 1983,\nHorowitz 1998, Sinnott-Armstrong 2008, Cushman et al 2008, Barry et al\n2014). \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Cited Works", "Further Reading"], "cat_ref_text": {"Cited Works": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anscombe, G.E.M., 1958, <em>Intention</em>, Oxford: Basil\nBlackwell.", "Aronson, Jerrold L., 1971, \u201cOn the Grammar of Cause,\u201d\n<em>Synthese</em>, 22: 414\u2013430.", "Asscher, Joachim, 2007, \u201cKilling and Letting Die: The\nSimilarity Criterion,\u201d <em>Journal of Applied Philosophy</em>,\n24 (3): 271\u2013282.", "Barry, Christian, Matthew Lindauer, and Gerhard \u00d8verland,\n2014, \u201cDoing, Allowing, and Enabling Harm: An Empirical\nInvestigation,\u201d in J.
