Weak vs. Strong Emergence: Contested Phenomena\n\nCertain phenomena and theoretical considerations motivating some\ncontemporary theorists to endorse a strong emergentist construal of\nthose phenomena. (It bears emphasis that strong emergentists typically\nalso suppose that some interesting organized behavior is more\nplausibly understood either reductively or as weakly emergent: their\nstrong emergentism is piecemeal.) This final section summarizes those\nphenomena and considers in general terms the different ways strong and\nweak emergentists might go about treating them.\n",
