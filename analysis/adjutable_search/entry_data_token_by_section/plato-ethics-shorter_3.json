    "main_text": "The Instrumentality of Virtue\n6. The Instrumentality of Virtue\n\nAre virtues instrumental for other goods, or are they good in\nthemselves? Are they good in themselves or because they promote our\nhappiness? If they are instrumental, are they instrumental in respect\nof themselves, by causing virtue to grow in the holders of virtue and\nin those on whom they have influence? Or are they instrumental in\nhelping us procure external goods for ourselves such as power or\nhappiness? On the instrumentality of virtue there was an important\ndispute between Vlastos and Irwin.\n\nIn a famous passage in Republic 1, which has many affinities\nwith dialogues of our group, a sophist named Thrasymachus challenges\nSocrates to define justice without saying (as he was apparently known\nfor doing) that justice is the beneficial or the advantageous (336d).\nInstead, Thrasymachus insists on the precision that specifies who\nreceives the benefit or advantage of justice; in Thrasymachus\u2019\nview it is the rulers who reap the benefits, while those who are ruled\npay a heavy price. Socrates defends the use of terms such as\n\u201cbeneficial\u201d in defining justice, implying that he would\naccept some sort of instrumental view, but he plainly holds that\njustice is beneficial to everyone who is touched by it. This is the\nmain theme of the Republic, but it also resonates with the\nshorter ethical dialogues, as we shall see. The ending of the\n Hippias Major\n bears on the problem of instrumentality through a discussion of the\nbeneficial as replicating its own goodness (as virtue engenders\nvirtue). Socrates appears to be the first to make eudaimonia\n(happiness, the good life) a goal in ethics. On the relation between\nvirtue and happiness in Socrates\u2019 thought, see Reshotko 2013 and\nWoodruff 2023.\n",
