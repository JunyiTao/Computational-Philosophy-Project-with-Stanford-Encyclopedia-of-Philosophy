    "main_text": "Central Features of the Common Good || A Nonaggregative Concern\n4.5 A Nonaggregative Concern\n\nA closely related feature is that most conceptions of the common good\ndo not take an aggregative view of individual interests. The\naggregative view treats the satisfaction of individuals\u2019\ninterests as commensurable values, and it directs citizens to maximize\nthe sum of these values. Because it focuses on the aggregate, the\naggregative view may require citizens to impose a debilitating\ncondition on some of their fellow citizens when this would generate\nsufficient gains for others.\n\nSolidarity rules out the aggregative view. Starting with an\nappropriate view of her own interests, solidarity requires each\ncitizen to give certain interests of her fellow citizens a status in\nher reasoning that is similar to the status that she gives to her own\ninterests. This way of thinking does not allow citizens to abandon the\ninterests of any of their fellow citizens for the sake of aggregate\ngains. For instance, solidarity would not allow citizens to subject\nsome of their fellow citizens to slavery, even if this might produce\nsubstantial benefits for others, because enslavement would involve a\nfailure on the part of each citizen to give the interests of each of\nher enslaved comrades the right status in her reasoning.\n",
