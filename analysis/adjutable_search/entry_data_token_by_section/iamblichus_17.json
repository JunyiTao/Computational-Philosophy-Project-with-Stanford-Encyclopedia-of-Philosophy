There Iamblichus rejects Porphyry\u2019s\naccount of divine hierarchy as misleading, since Porphyry regarded\nclasses of divine beings as species ranked under the same genus and\ndetermined by \u201cproperties\u201d (idi\u014dmata) that\nact as specific differentiae (Reply to Porphyry, I, 4\n[SS-2013: 7.21\u20138.6]). In so doing, Porphyry ruins the very idea\nof hierarchy: divine comes to be a common genus which is\npredicated of all of its species, in the same way as animal\nis predicated of (say) horse and dog. Against\nPorphyry, Iamblichus calls for a qualified use of logical notions\nwhich makes the hierarchical relation between different classes of\ndivine beings clear. Each level differs from the others as a whole and\nnot in the same way as different species are divided under the same\ncommon genus. As said above, in his interpretation of the\nCategories Iamblichus argued that the genus is a hierarchical\nrelation in which items from different levels are analogically\nconnected to their origin. This can be set in parallel with what\nIamblichus says in the Reply to Porphyry:\n\n\nBut if one were to apply an analogical principle of identity to\ndifferent genera, for example to the many genera of gods, and again to\nthose among the demons and heroes, and lastly in the case of souls,\nthen one might succeed in defining their specific characteristics.\n(Reply to Porphyry, I, 4 [SS-2013: 10.25\u201311.4], trans.\nCDH-2003)\n\n",
