In consequence of the demise\nof ancient materialist or corporealist thought such as Epicureanism\nand Stoicism, Neoplatonism became the dominant philosophical ideology\nof the period, offering a comprehensive understanding of the universe\nand the individual human being\u2019s place in it. However, in\ncontrast to labels such as \u201cStoic\u201d,\n\u201cPeripatetic\u201d or \u201cPlatonic\u201d, the designation\n\u201cNeoplatonic\u201d is of modern coinage and to some extent a\nmisnomer. Late antique philosophers now counted among \u201cthe\nNeoplatonists\u201d did not think of themselves as engaged in some\nsort of effort specifically to revive the spirit and the letter of\nPlato\u2019s dialogues. To be sure, they did call themselves\n\u201cPlatonists\u201d and held Plato\u2019s views, which they\nunderstood as a positive system of philosophical doctrine, in higher\nesteem than the tenets of the pre-Socratics, Aristotle, or any other\nsubsequent thinker. However, and more importantly, their signature\nproject is more accurately described as a grand synthesis of an\nintellectual heritage that was by then exceedingly rich and\nprofound. In effect, they absorbed, appropriated, and creatively\nharmonized almost the entire Hellenic tradition of philosophy,\nreligion, and even literature\u2014with the exceptions of\nEpicureanism, which they roundly rejected, and the thoroughgoing\ncorporealism of the Stoics. The result of this effort was a grandiose\nand powerfully persuasive system of thought that reflected upon a\nmillennium of intellectual culture and brought the scientific and\nmoral theories of Plato, Aristotle, and the ethics of the Stoics into\nfruitful dialogue with literature, myth, and religious practice. In\nvirtue of their inherent respect for the writings of many of their\npredecessors, the Neoplatonists together offered a kind of\nmeta-discourse and reflection on the sum-total of ideas produced over\ncenturies of sustained inquiry into the human condition.\nAs a natural consequence of their insistence on the undiminished\nrelevance of the past, the Neoplatonists developed their\ncharacteristically speculative brand of philosophical enquiry in which\nempirical facts tended to serve as illustrations rather than heuristic\nstarting points or test cases. Today, the Neoplatonic system may\nstrike one as lofty, counterintuitive, and implausible, but to dismiss\nit out of hand is difficult, especially if one is prepared to take\nseriously a few fundamental assumptions that are at least not\nobviously wrong and may possibly be right.\nThe most fundamental of these assumptions, which the Neoplatonists\nshared with the majority of intellectuals of the ancient world,\nincluding most pre-Socratic thinkers as well as Socrates, Plato,\nAristotle and their followers, is that mindful consciousness\n(nous, often translated as thought, intelligence, or\nintellect) is in an important sense ontologically prior to the\nphysical realm typically taken for ultimate reality (Mind over\nMatter). There existed a dispute between Plato and Aristotle over\nwhether or not the objects of mindful consciousness (abstract\nconcepts, Platonic or otherwise, numbers, geometrical properties, and\nso forth) are also ontologically prior, but the Neoplatonists regarded\nthis fact as a matter of inconsequential detail. And so, following a\nvenerable and abiding tradition of Mind over Matter, Neoplatonism\ninevitably turned out to be an idealist type of philosophy.\nThe second assumption, which the Neoplatonists shared with the\nStoics and the Hermetists (an influential group of Egyptian religious\nthinkers that predate the rise of Neoplatonism), was that reality, in\nall its cognitive and physical manifestations, depended on a highest\nprinciple which is unitary and singular. Neoplatonic philosophy is a\nstrict form of principle-monism that strives to understand everything\non the basis of a single cause that they considered divine, and\nindiscriminately referred to as \u201cthe First\u201d, \u201cthe\nOne\u201d, or \u201cthe Good\u201d. Since it is reasonable to\nassume, as the Neoplatonists did, that any efficient cause is\nontologically prior to, and hence more real, than its effect, then, in\nthe hierarchy of being, the first principle, whatever it is, cannot be\nless \u201creal\u201d than the phenomena it is supposed to explain.\nGiven the veracity of the first assumption (the ontological priority\nof intelligence and consciousness), it follows at once that the first\nprinciple must be a principle of consciousness. In consequence, the\nfundamental challenge all Neoplatonists struggled to meet was\nessentially the following: How are we to understand and describe the\nemergence of the universe, with all its diverse phenomena, as the\neffect of a singular principle of consciousness? In\nparticular\u2014and in this regard Neoplatonism shares certain\nconcerns with modern cosmology\u2014how is it possible to understand\nthe emergence of the physical, material universe from a singularity\nthat is in every sense unlike this universe? Their answer to this\nquestion was entirely new, and went far beyond any prior cosmic\naetiology, including that of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, in\nelegance and sophistication.\n", "toc": [{"#HisOriAnt": "1.

Historical Orientation: Antiquity\nRightly or wrongly, the Egyptian-born Plotinus (204/5\u2013270) is\ncommonly regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. He was a pupil of\nthe Alexandrian philosopher Ammonius Saccas (3nd century), who reportedly did not\npublish anything and remains one of the most enigmatic philosophers of\nall antiquity. Around 245, at the age of 40, Plotinus moved from\nAlexandria to Rome and founded a school of philosophy there. At first,\nhis instruction too was entirely oral, until his most talented pupil,\nPorphyry, persuaded him to commit his seminars to the page. After\nPlotinus\u2019 death, Porphyry edited and published these writings,\nhaving arranged them in a collection of six books consisting of nine\nessays each (the so-called \u201cEnneads\u201d or\n\u201cnines\u201d).\nBy any standard of intellectual prowess, Plotinus is one of the\nintellectual giants of antiquity, on a par with the likes of Plato,\nAristotle, and Chrysippus, even if modernity is still hesitant to\naccord him such an exalted status. As in the case of his preeminent\nprecursors, Plotinus\u2019 philosophical system combines innovation\nwith tradition. The question of precisely which predecessors inspired\nhim is still unclear and in need of further investigation. Carefully\nselected passages from Plato\u2019s dialogues and Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics often serve him as starting points for his own\nspeculations; Stoic ethics is very much in evidence, as are the views\nof the Peripatetic philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd-3rd centuries). A general\nintellectual background is provided by the so-called Middle\nPlatonists, above all Numenius of Apamea (2nd\ncentury). Moreover, it is not impossible that Gnosticism (which\nPlotinus vehemently opposed) as well as the writings circulating under\nthe name of Hermes Trismegistus confirmed or even informed his\nmetaphysical monism. Lastly, Plotinus may have been well aware of the\nrise of Christianity, but if so, he was not as alarmed by it as his\npupil Porphyry.\nIn the course of its history in late antiquity, Neoplatonism proved\nto be adaptable, fluid and dynamic, much more so than the system of\nthe Stoics, the dominant philosophy during Hellenistic times. It\nappealed to the mundane literati as much as to the religious\nzealot, to the die-hard pagan as much as to the up-start Christian who\nneeded a philosophical background to parse the theological fine points\nwhich would eventually distinguish the orthodox from the\nheretic. Important figures of late antique Neoplatonism were the\nalready mentioned pupil of Plotinus, Porphyry, his pupil Iamblichus,\nPlutarch of Athens, Syrianus, Proclus, Simplicius, Damascius, Ammonius\nHermeiou, John Philoponus, Olympiodorus, and Stephanus of Alexandria,\nto name but the most important. All of them, in different and fascinating ways,\ncontributed to the development and internal diversification of the\nschool\u2019s doctrines. (Some of these philosophers have their own\nentries in this encyclopedia; see the Related Entries section\nbelow.) \nImportantly, the new direction Plotinus, and presumably Ammonius\nSaccas before him, had given to Greek philosophy gradually acquired\ntraction among the Greco-Roman elites. Ironically, it may have\ncontributed to the acceptance of Christianity among the educated,\nthereby elevating the religious sentiments of the empire\u2019s\nmisfits and downtrodden to the ideology of a political system\nsanctified by the will of god. Evidence for the increasing\nNeoplatonization of Christianity is abundant: The brilliant Christian\ntheologian Origen, some twenty years older than Plotinus, may also\nhave been a pupil of Ammonius Saccas; the Cappadocian Fathers Basil\nand Gregory of Nazianzus spent their youth in philosophical study in\nAthens in the 4th century, where they most certainly were\nexposed to Neoplatonism, while Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) was\nintimately familiar with the writings of Plotinus and Porphyry. The\ncut-throat debates about transubstantiation (in the Eucharist), the\nhypostases of the Trinity, or the divine/human nature of Christ, could\nnot even be followed without a thorough training in current Greek\nphilosophical discourse. By the end of the 5th century, the\naudience in the philosophical classrooms in Alexandria was\npredominantly Christian, and Neoplatonism continued to be taught in\nsome form or other in Athens, Alexandria, Constantinople, Baghdad,\nMistra, and other pockets of learning until its triumphant revival in\nRenaissance Italy.\n2. The One\nWhat was it that made the radically top-down idealism of the\nNeoplatonists so appealing? Disregarding in this context the\nreligious-sentimental appeal Neoplatonism undoubtedly must have had\nand perhaps still has, its philosophical attractiveness and\nsignificance lies in the fact that it offered a maximum of explanatory\npower on the basis of just one metaphysical principle. Even though the\nsystem coheres in such a way that it is possible to approach it from\nmany angles, it is perhaps best to begin at the top of the ontological\npyramid and to return to the question posed earlier: How is it\npossible to explain the world\u2019s emergence from a single divine\nprinciple of consciousness?\nIt may be useful first to state that the pagan Neoplatonists were\nnot creationists. That is to say, whatever account they were giving\nabout the universe\u2019s origin, this narrative was not to be\nmisunderstood as recounting a creation in time or at the very\nbeginning of time. Instead, they speculated that the process of the\nemergence of the universe from the divine principle, as they conceived\nof it (described below), has gone on forever, just as it continues at\nthis very moment and will continue to do so, sustaining a world\nwithout end. When the general outlook of Neoplatonism was appropriated\nand adapted to refine and articulate the creeds of Christianity,\nIslam, and Judaism, this feature of the doctrine, and the connected\ndoctrine of the eternity of the world, would become a vigorously\ndebated issue.\nSecond, unlike the ancient theologians of Israel and Egypt, the\nNeoplatonists did not think that the universe could spring from the\ndeity directly and in a way that surpasses all understanding, for\nexample by being thought and spoken into existence. Their more refined\nview was that reality emerged from \u201cthe First\u201d in coherent\nstages, in such a way that one stage functions as creative principle\nof the next.\nThis kind of emanationist cosmology rests on the tenet\u2014based\nto some extent in observation, but elevated by them to the status of a\nheuristic principle\u2014that every activity in the world is in some\nsense double insofar as it possesses both an inner and an outer\naspect.  For example, the inner activity of the sun (nuclear fusion,\nas we now know) has the outer effect of heat and light, themselves\nactivities as well. Or the inner activity of a tree that is determined\nby the kind of tree it is (its genetic code, we would now say;\nthe Neoplatonists spoke of an inherent formative principle,\nlogos) results in the bearing of a particular kind of fruit;\nor again, thoughts and feelings internal to human beings express\nthemselves in speech and actions. In each case, the outer effect is\nnot the purpose or end of the inner activity; rather, it is simply the\ncase that one falls out of the other and is concomitant with\nit. Furthermore, it is also the case that these outer activities will\ntypically be productive of yet other outer activities that are\nontologically more remote and derivative: Fruit serves as nourishment\nor poison for other individual life forms, and human speech and action\nconstitute, over time, a person\u2019s biography or a society\u2019s\nhistory. It is important to note that, in all cases, the outer\nactivity will not be some random affair, but rather something\nintimately connected with the inner activity it is an expression\nof. In other words, any inner activity will somehow prefigure the\ncharacter and nature of its outer effect.  Thus, the Neoplatonists\ninsisted that there is nothing on the lower ontological levels within\nthe chains of causality that is not somehow prefigured on the\ncorresponding higher levels. In general, no property emerges unless it\nis already in some way preformed and pre-existent in its cause.\nAs regards the very first principle of reality, conceived of as an\nentity that is beyond Being, transcending all physical reality, very\nlittle can actually be said, except that it is absolute\nUnity. However, we know empirically of its effect, the entire\nuniverse, and we must therefore suppose that the One is the carrier\nof, or rather identical with, a boundless sort of singular activity or\nenergy. Since it is counterintuitive to suppose that the material\nuniverse leapt into being in its present form directly from this\nwell-spring of energy, the question arises: what precisely is the\nfirst and primary outer activity of the inner activity of the One?\n3. Absolute Consciousness\nIn accordance with the Platonic-Aristotelian commitment to Mind\nover Matter the Neoplatonists\u2019 answer to this question was that\nthe outer activity and effect of the First must be nous, a\ndifficult and ambiguous concept commonly translated as\n\u201cIntellect\u201d. It seems preferable to translate the term\nnous in an experientially more concrete and accessible way as\npure and absolute \u201cConsciousness\u201d. According to\nNeoplatonic theory, Consciousness would not be some kind of emergent\nproperty of material constituents arranged in a certain way, but\nrather be the first effect of the activity of the One, the most\nsupreme form of reality (since the One was posited to be beyond\nBeing), a kind of pre-embodied power of cognition as\nsuch. Neoplatonists referred to Consciousness as the second\n\u201cHypostasis\u201d, a term that would have a long and complex\nhistory as it acquired new and related meanings in Christian\ncontexts. \u201cHypostasis\u201d is an abstract noun derived from a\nverb meaning \u201cto place oneself under or beneath\u201d, with the\nconnotation of \u201cstanding one\u2019s ground\u201d. The word\n\u201chypostasis\u201d therefore denotes a distinct substantial\nbeing or realm of reality of a certain kind which, in the case of\nConsciousness, is the derivative outer activity of the first\nprinciple. The term could also be applied to the One as the\n\u201cfirst hypostasis\u201d, in which case the connotation of\nsubordination would recede into the background.\nWhat, then, is the inner activity of Consciousness? The inherent\ntask of consciousness is to understand, and understanding entails the\ncognition of causes. In trying to understand itself, Consciousness can\nonly turn towards its origin and thus posit or behold the\nFirst as the transcendent principle of its own reality. As the\nNeoplatonists would put it, having emerged from the First,\nConsciousness \u201cturns back\u201d towards it in order to\nunderstand the pre-condition of its own existence. Becoming thus aware\nof another entity, the originary unity of Consciousness breaks up into\nduality, and with it emerge the categories of identity and difference,\nof greater and smaller, of number, of change and of rest. In fact, in\na way not fully explained, or perhaps even explicable, the entire\nideal world of Platonic forms and ideas emerges effortlessly in the\ncourse of Consciousness\u2019 effort to understand itself.\nBefore we move on to discuss the outer effect of this inner\nactivity of Consciousness, we must correct the common assertion that\nwhat we are dealing with here is a process of\n\u201cemanation\u201d. To be sure, Consciousness (or Intellect)\nsomehow emerges from the activity of the First, but calling this a\nprocess of emanation, with its obviously materialist connotations, is\nmisleading. The Neoplatonists used the words \u201cprocession and\nreturn\u201d (prohodos and epistroph\u00ea),\nwhich, as spatial metaphors, are not much better either. And even\nthough the analogy oftentimes invoked in this context is that of light\nradiating out from the sun, this too does not do much to help us grasp\nthe nature of the Neoplatonic theory of how Consciousness, and by\nimplication the entire rest of reality, eternally emerges from the\nfirst cause. In essence, there is no process of generation or\nproduction; nothing material or spatial is happening; no agent exerts\nits influence on a patient. Although the Neoplatonists followed\nPlatonic tradition in talking about a demiurge (divine craftsman),\ntheir cosmology has nothing demiurgic about it, as Plotinus rarely\nfailed to point out. Craftsmen think, forge, labor, arrange, and\ncoordinate a host of diverse technical operations towards the creation\nof some product of their craft. Unlike Plato\u2019s character Timaeus\nor the authors of Genesis, Neoplatonic metaphysics has no room for\nsuch crude analogies. In the realm of Consciousness, the activity is\none and constitutes itself as a multiplicity within that unity. In the\nidentity of the activity of thought with its objects, the\nNeoplatonists contended, the ideal world of all forms and ideas came\nto be conceptualized. Here again, in an unintentional and effortless\nway, this inner active life of Consciousness produces further outer\neffect, the Soul.\n4. Soul and Nature\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, structural and\ndispositional diversities present in the inanimate material world\nconverge towards irreversible entropy and disorder. In the biosphere,\nhowever, we witness a tendency to ever increasing diversification of\nnatural kinds and species. From a Neoplatonic point of view, this\nlatter fact is readily explained by the entirely non-Darwinian\nsupposition of eternal Forms of natural kinds in the hypostasis of\nConsciousness which gradually emerge in the world, limited by space\nand time, in some sort of evolutionary organic process. As has already\nbeen pointed out, the Neoplatonists assumed as axiomatic that nothing\ncould come to be here below that is not prefigured paradigmatically in\nthe intelligible realm.\nAlthough one might think that the phenomenon of evolution militates\nagainst Neoplatonic theory, it is actually compatible with it; to some\ndegree, it is precisely what we should expect as the empirical upshot\nof such metaphysical assumptions. Moreover, in distinction to the\nForms posited in the old Academy of Plato and his immediate\nsuccessors, the Forms of the Neoplatonists, far from being mere\nschemata, definitions, or ghostly blueprints of the natural world, are\nrather noetic entities teeming with conscious life. They actively and\ndynamically interrelate in such a way as to constitute a living noetic\ncosmos; and it is their rich inner life, the conscious activity of\nthoughts that they are, which is ultimately responsible for the\nappearance of images of them in space and time to make up the physical\nuniverse and everything contained in it. But this is by no means easy\nto understand. How exactly can images of eternal and immutable Forms,\nprefigured in Consciousness as such, become manifest in, and in fact\nconstitute, the material world?\nTo understand and explain how precisely it is that mind and matter\ninteract with one another in general is a considerable and perennial\nphilosophical problem. Approaches to it that start from modern\nmaterialist assumptions have not yielded plausible answers any more\nreadily than the Neoplatonists\u2019 idealist perspective. Even\nthough the Neoplatonists afforded it extensive treatment, they,\nunsurprisingly, have not satisfactorily explained it either. In a\nnutshell, the answer they gave has something to do with their\nfundamental understanding of the realm of the psychic. Plotinus in\nparticular struggled in long and meandering treatises to explicate the\nprecise functioning of the general phenomenon of what the ancients\ncalled \u201cSoul\u201d (psych\u00ea). Soul, a further\nhypostasis of being that effortlessly \u201cfalls out of\u201d the\ninner activity of Consciousness in a similar way as Consciousness\n\u201cfell out of\u201d the First, is the link that facilitates the\nmanifestation of form in matter. Their ingenious speculation about\nSoul, understood in its relationship to its cause (pure Consciousness)\non the one hand and its effect (the emergence of the living material\nuniverse) on the other, lies at the heart of Neoplatonism. In a manner\nof speaking, Neoplatonism is nothing but a philosophy of the soul, or\n\u201cpsychology\u201d in the original sense of that word.\nIn living beings, and human beings in particular, consciousness is\nbut one psychic activity among others. The realm of the psychic\nextends in a continuum from the loftiest processes of knowing, memory,\nand imagination down to the most rudimentary forms and expressions of\nlife that characterize the world\u2019s biosphere (natural processes\nof metabolism, growth, etc.). Many influential ancient thinkers, both\nphilosophers and poets, regarded the universe as a living being, not\nonly in its parts but also and especially as whole. In the\nTimaeus, Plato had described in detail the structure and\nfunction of the world soul, and had recounted the way in which it was\nput together by a divine craftsman (demiurge) and conjoined with the\nrealm of disorderly matter, upon which it controlled and imposed\norder.  Plotinus and his followers had a quite different view. There\nis no planning on account of anyone, no \u201cconstruction\u201d of\none metaphysical entity by another; instead, soul, that is to say the\ngeneral phenomenon of life capable of animating matter, is merely the\nmanifest outer aspect of the inner activity of Consciousness.\nThe general idea is that Soul, qua outer activity of\nConsciousness, looks back at its cause in order to understand\nitself so as to truly be what it is. Gazing thus at the forms and\nideas eternally present in Consciousness, it becomes\n\u201cinformed\u201d by them and carries forward, by some manner of\nbenevolent necessity, images of the eternal forms into the lower realm\nof Being. Giving birth to the entire universe and the biosphere on\nearth in this way, one could say that the sum total of the corporeal,\nsensible world rests in Soul, not the other way round, that soul\nresides in the bodies it animates.\nAccording to Neoplatonic theory, then, the world as we know and\nexperience it in its formal and structural characteristics is the\nouter effect of the activity and life of Consciousness, an activity\nthat was thought to be mediated \u201cfrom above\u201d by another,\nintermediate metaphysical entity, Soul. The precise ontological status\nof Soul as another hypostasis in its own right remains somewhat\nunderdetermined, for in a manner of speaking Soul is the very process\nof expressing the intelligible world in the derivative form of\nsensible natural living beings and the lives they live.\nThe Neoplatonists drew a distinction between \u201cSoul\u201d and\n\u201cNature\u201d (phusis) that amounts to a hierarchical\nseparation of higher and lower psychical functions. For the\nNeoplatonists, \u201cNature\u201d denotes not only the essence or\nnature of each natural being or the entirety of the natural world\n(Nature as a whole), but also, and in the first instance, a lower\naspect of conscious life (the \u201cautonomic\u201d life activities\nthat are not consciously controlled by the individual animal\u2019s\nconsciousness) which beholds, in a kind of diminished vision, relevant\naspects of the intelligible world and brings them forth in an act of\nsilent contemplation. Thus, every aspect of the natural world, even\nthe meanest piece of inorganic and apparently useless matter, has an\neternal and divine moment. For all the other-worldliness often\nassociated with Neoplatonic philosophy, then, it needs to be\nemphasized that the material world they inhabited was for this reason\nan essentially good and beautiful place, the effortless product of\ncosmic providence and divine power, and worthy of reverence.\n5. Matter\nWithout light, it would not make any sense to speak of darkness. In\nfact, there would be no such thing as darkness, since darkness is, if\nit is anything, light\u2019s absence and opposite. In the same way as\ndarkness is a by-product of light, so matter, the Neoplatonists\nreasoned, is nothing but a by-product of the dynamic emanation of the\nFirst. In fact, it is the limit at which the energy transmitted in the\nchain of inner and outer activities at the various levels of reality\nexhausts itself and comes to an end. Just as darkness has no capacity\nto make itself visible, in the same way matter no longer has any inner\nactivity that could give rise to a further outer activity. As such, it\nis merely passive, and the eternal process of consecutive production\nof ever lower levels of reality necessarily comes to an end. But\nimportantly for us, it is the realm at which the activity of Soul\ninformed by Consciousness becomes phenomenal and perceptible. It would\nbe wrong to say that matter does not exist at all, or is a nothing.\nAccording to this theory, at any rate, matter exists, but not as a\nseparate ontological principle distinct from the One with effects of\nits own. Rather, it is a fringe phenomenon of the life of the soul, a\nby-product of the activity of higher realms of Being. As such, it is\nno thing, an entirely immaterial and formless non-entity. This\nPlotinian doctrine was destined to raise controversy among later\nNeoplatonists, when it was proposed that matter should at the very\nleast have the property of undefined three-dimensionality.\nAn even more controversial doctrine connected to matter was the\nexplanation of evil. Plotinus had tried to uphold the view, consistent\nwith his entire ontology, that at no point in the great chain of Being\ncoming from above does anything emerge that could be regarded as evil,\nor the cause of evil. Nevertheless, evil, and in particular moral\nevil, is obviously part of our experience of the world, and an\nexplanation had to be given as to where it originated. Plotinus\u2019\nanswer was that evil arises from below, not above, and is intimately\nconnected with matter. Yet importantly, matter is not an independent\nprinciple of evil in any Manichean or Gnostic sense, as it has no\nactive power on its own. Rather, evil arises if and when higher\nbeings, and in particular human beings, direct their attention towards\nthe material world below, instead of the intelligible world above, and\nhave an all-encompassing concern for it. The regard\ndownwards, as it were, rather than upwards towards Consciousness and\nthe divine essences, is what contaminates the soul and renders it\nmorally evil.  Even though it is surprising how much explanatory force\nfor the nature and existence of moral evil this theory affords, it\nremained controversial even among Neoplatonists. Proclus, in the fifth\ncentury, dedicated an entire treatise to repudiating Plotinus on this\npoint.  Proclus abandoned the comforting notion of the essential\ngoodness of humanity and, not unlike Augustine before him, insisted on\nthe real possibility of the moral depravity of the human soul\nqua soul.\n6. Ethics\nAs human beings we are, with our bodies, part of the material\nworld; but importantly, we are living organisms that can place\nourselves in opposition to the needs and concerns of the body and\nreflect upon our own condition. Nothing just material would be able do\nthat, according to the Neoplatonists, and therefore we have what the\nancients called a \u201csoul\u201d. Moreover, our souls operate on a\nlevel of consciousness and intelligence that surpasses the cognition\nof all other creatures. Finally, just as everything else that has\nbeing, we are individual units and participate, again, as the\nNeoplatonists would express it, in the form of Unity.\nLooked at from this point of view, human existence is a striking\nrepresentation of the cosmos as a whole, a microcosm in which all\nlevels of being (Unity, Consciousness, Soul, Nature, Matter) are\ncombined into one organic individual. The Neoplatonists took this to\nbe a clear indication that we, just like the entire cosmic edifice,\n\u201ccame from above\u201d. A human being is therefore in the first\ninstance not a social or political being, but a divine being, and\nlife\u2019s purpose was seen not so much in the exercise and\nrehearsal of the traditional virtues that give meaning and quality to\nour interaction with others, but in seeking \u201cto bring back the\ngod in us to the divine in the All\u201d, as Plotinus pressed upon\nhis followers on the very point of his death (Porphyry, Life of\nPlotinus 2).\nNeoplatonic ethics recognizes the social importance and value of\nthe so-called cardinal virtues (justice, prudence, temperance, and\ncourage), but the virtues\u2019 main function lies in purifying and\npreparing us for a much more momentous individual relationship, that\nwith divine Consciousness and, ultimately, the first principle itself.\nNecessarily, then, the moral precepts of the Neoplatonists concern the\nindividual person, the goal being not the mundane fulfillment of life\nwithin the bounds of what is humanly possible, but nothing less than\neudaimonia in its most expansive sense, deification.\nUnsurprisingly, the route to salvation turned out to be the\nphilosophic life, a sincere and arduous effort of the mind to return\nto the One and forever abrogate any concerns for the body. It was on\nthis basis that the Neoplatonists would most vehemently protest\nagainst the latter-day Christian dogma that human salvation has\nalready been accomplished vicariously through the life and death of a\nman revered as the son of god.\n7. Later Developments in Antiquity\nAt a time when the considered wisdom of Greece and Rome came under\nincreasing pressure to re-articulate its commitments in the face of\nwaves of novel movements that lay claim to revelatory truth, the\nNeoplatonists too strove to refine their teachings and to delineate\nthe metaphysical architecture of the world as they saw it. No longer\nwould it suffice to hold forth on philosophical issues, as Plato,\nCicero, and to some extent Plotinus had done, in a serious yet\nexploratory and protreptic spirit. In order to be heard in an\nincreasingly competitive marketplace of ideas teeming with holy men of\nevery kind and temperament, views had to be laid out clearly and in\nsystematic fashion. In some of its later manifestations, like Stoicism\nand Epicureanism before it, Neoplatonism drifted towards scholasticism\nand reveled in dogmatic system building.\nAlong the way, all kinds of refinements and modifications of\nnomenclature were introduced. Distinctions were drawn up within the\nhypostases of Consciousness and Soul in order to try to articulate the\ntransitions from one level of Being to another. An entire industry of\nteaching and commenting sprang up to interpret a millennium of\nHellenic philosophy in the light of the core commitments of\nNeoplatonism.  Certain philosophic predecessors were elevated to the\nstatus of nearly infallible authorities, and the texts of Plato and\nAristotle were comprehensively read, diligently analyzed, and\nruthlessly harmonized.  Finally, in an effort to stem the rising tide\nof all kinds of new salvation-peddling cults then inundating the Roman\nEmpire, the ancient religious traditions of the Greeks and especially\nthe Egyptians were brought into the fold and given new significance\nand meaning. But after the untimely death of Emperor Julian (363), a\nNeoplatonist himself, none of these efforts could any longer withstand\nthe tidal wave of Christendom.\nThe most vigorous group of Neoplatonists, living in Athens and\nstill adhering to the old rituals, disbanded in the aftermath of\nEmperor Justinian\u2019s legislation of 529, which resulted in the\nclosing of the Platonist academy. Hellenic philosophy and the teaching\nof its attendant disciplines went on in Alexandria and Constantinople\nuntil the end of the 6th century, but were now being taught\nby people who had either embraced or otherwise come to terms with the\nnew religion. The Arab conquest in the 7th century\nobliterated and appropriated in equal measure, but the real revival of\nNeoplatonism occurred when humanists made the treasures of late\nantique Greece available to the Renaissance intelligentsia of Italy,\nFrance, and Germany.\n8. Influence\n\nIt is an undeniable fact, although nowadays rarely acknowledged, that\nthe general outlook and the principal doctrines of the Neoplatonists\nproved exceedingly influential throughout the entire history of\nwestern philosophy. Through Augustine (354\u2013430) in the West and\nthe 4th-century Cappadocian Fathers (Basil, Gregory of\nNyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus) in the East as well as the\npseudo-epigraphic writings of Dionysius the Areopagite (early\n6th century), Neoplatonism profoundly influenced the\nemergence of mainstream and not so mainstream Christian theology (John\nScotus Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Meister Eckhart). In\naddition, by way of a pseudo-epigraphical treatise\nentitled Theology of Aristotle, Neoplatonic thought\nfacilitated the integration of ancient philosophy and science into\nboth Islam (especially through Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi and Avicenna [Ibn\nSina]) and Judaism (Maimonides).\n\nDuring the Renaissance, ancient Greek learning, and Neoplatonism in\nparticular, experienced a dramatic revival in the West in the wake of\nthe work of Gemistus Plethon (1355\u20131452), Bessarion\n(1403\u20131472) and, above all, Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499),\nwhose translation and interpretation of Plato and Plotinus in the\nsecond half of the 15th century influenced not only the\nphilosophy, but also the art and literature of the period. It may even\nbe true to say that even more than the writings of Plato and Aristotle\nthemselves Neoplatonic ideas have continued to influence Western\nthinkers of the idealist persuasion, such as the Cambridge Platonists\n(who were really Neoplatonists), Leibniz, Hegel, Schelling, Fichte,\nBergson and Teilhard de Chardin, to name but a few.\nThe history of Neoplatonism until the present day is much too\ndiverse and complex to be done justice to in an introductory article\nsuch as this. In spite of the ubiquity of proponents of this developed\nform of Platonism in all historical periods of western philosophy\nsince late antiquity, today Neoplatonism has acquired the reputation\nof being speculative and abstract to a fault. Modern philosophical\ncommitments to empiricism, logical positivism, and the analysis of\nlanguage have not helped much to arrive at a judicious evaluation of\nthe movement, its strengths and its weaknesses, and the dramatic\nscientific discoveries of contemporary bottom-up materialism tend to\ndeter students from even attempting to find their way into the world\nof Neoplatonism. Perhaps another reason that this kind of thinking\nstrikes the general public as arcane and alien may be that the Abrahamic\nreligions, even if they too posit a single divine principle as the\nsource of all being, conceive of this principle as a person and maker.\nThis vestige of pre-philosophical anthropomorphism bypasses the\ndifficult questions that the last pagan thinkers so arduously\nstruggled to answer when they sought to explain the existence of the\ndiverse and complex physical world from a non-material principle that\nthey assumed to be nothing but One.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"EssReaLatAntNeoWor\">Essential readings of late-antique Neoplatonic Works</a>", "<a id=\"SelIntSecLit\">Selected Introductory Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"EssReaLatAntNeoWor\">Essential readings of late-antique Neoplatonic Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Plotinus, <em>Enneads</em>", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 I 1 (<em>What is the Living Being and what\nis Man?</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 I 2 (<em>On Virtues</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 I 4 (<em>On Well-Being</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 I 6 (<em>On Beauty</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 I 8 (<em>What is Evil and Where Does it Come\nFrom?</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 II 4 (<em>On Matter</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 III 8 (<em>On Nature and\nContemplation</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 IV 8 (<em>On the Descent of the Soul in\nBodies</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 V 1 (<em>On the Three Primary\nHypostases</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 V 9 (<em>On Intellect, The Forms, and\nBeing</em>)", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 VI 8 (<em>On Free Will and the Will of the\nOne</em>)", "Porphyry, <em>Life of Plotinus</em>", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>Isagoge</em>", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>On Abstinence</em>", "Iamblichus, <em>On the Egyptian Mysteries</em>", "Proclus, <em>Elements of Theology</em>", "Marinus, <em>Life of Proclus</em>", "Damascius, <em>Life of Isidore</em>", "Simplicius, <em>Commentary on Epictetus\u2019 Handbook</em>", "John Philoponus, <em>On the Eternity of the World against\nProclus</em>\n</ul>\n<p>For further and more detailed information on the development of\nNeoplatonism in the history of Western philosophy, or on specific\nNeoplatonic doctrines, refer to the Related Entries section below.</p>\n<h3>"], "<a id=\"SelIntSecLit\">Selected Introductory Secondary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Chiaradonna, Riccardo and Franco Trabattoni (eds.), 2009,\n<em>Physics and Philosophy of Nature in Greek Neoplatonism</em>,\nLeiden and Boston: Brill.", "Cooper, John M., 2012, <em>Pursuits of Wisdom: Six Ways of Life in\nAncient Philosophy from Socrates to Plotinus</em>, Princeton NJ:\nPrinceton University Press, Ch. 6.", "Emilsson, Eyjolfur Kjalar, 1988, <em>Plotinus on Sense-Perception:\nA Philosophical Study</em>, Cambridge (England) and New York, NY:\nCambridge University Press.", "Gerson, Lloyd P., 1994, <em>Plotinus</em>, London and New York:\nRoutledge.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 (ed.), 1996, <em>The Cambridge Companion to\nPlotinus</em>, Cambridge (England) and New York, NY: Cambridge\nUniversity Press.", "Gerson, Lloyd P.
