Existence and Identity Conditions for Properties\n\nQuine (1957 [1969: 23]) famously claimed that there should be no\nentity without identity. His paradigmatic case concerns sets: two of\nthem are identical iff they have exactly the same members. Since then\nit has been customary in ontology to search for identity conditions\nfor given categories of entities and to rule out categories for want\nof identity conditions (against this, see Lowe 1989). Quine started\nthis trend precisely by arguing against properties and this has\nstrictly intertwined the issues of which properties there are and of\ntheir identity\n conditions.[13]\n",
