    "main_text": "Significant Issues on Which Prichard Changed His Mind || The nature of obligation, or of obligatedness\n6.3 The nature of obligation, or of obligatedness\n\nPrichard\u2019s earliest work does seem to treat rightness or\nobligatoriness as a property of the action to be done, or rather, as a\nproperty of the action once it is done. By 1932, however, as discussed\nin section 3 above, he had moved to the view that obligation is a\nproperty of the agent, not of the act at all. There is some sign in\nhis published paper of that date that he had not yet extended the new\nview to include rightness, i.e. that he had come to distinguish\nrightness, which remained a property of the act and not of the agent,\nfrom obligation or obligatedness, now appearing as a property of the\nagent. For he writes \u2018While the truth could not be expressed by\nsaying \u2018My setting myself to do so-and-so would\nbe right, because I think it would have a certain\neffect\u2019 \u2013 a statement which would be as vicious in\nprinciple as the statement \u2018Doing so-and-so would\nbe right because I think it would be right\u2019\n\u2013 there is nothing to prevent its being expressible in the form\n\u2018I ought to set myself to do so-and-so because I think\nit would have a certain effect\u2019 (99\u2013100). With this\ndistinction the property of obligatoriness vanishes altogether, though\nrightness remains, grounded in the familiar combinations of the\n(objective) nature of the situation and some definite relation in\nwhich the agent stands to others or to himself. However, if this was\nPrichard\u2019s view at the time, no trace of it appears later, and\nRoss appears not to have noticed it at all (see his account of the\nargument of Prichard\u2019s 1932 paper in Ross 1939, ch. 7). And this\nis just as well, because it is very unsettling to be told that one can\nhave an obligation to do an action that is in fact wrong.\n",
