    "main_text": "Interpretation of Kant\n3. Interpretation of Kant\n\n\nBefore returning to Vaihinger\u2019s own positive philosophy, it is\nworth examining the task that occupied him intensely between the\npublication of (1876) and the PAO: the interpretation of\nKant. The rise of Neo-Kantianism in the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury brought with it a renewed interest in the historical study of\nthe critical philosophy. The majority of the works written during this\nperiod tended to approach Kant\u2019s texts polemically, either with\nthe aim of defending and \u201cupdating\u201d them, or with the\nintention of refuting them. In terms of its scholarly sobriety, depth\nof textual analysis, and sensitivity to Kant\u2019s immediate\nintellectual context, Vaihinger\u2019s Commentary was\nunique. He notes that his approach will be that of those who analyze\nancient texts \u201cwith philological sobriety and strict rigor\n\u2026 in order to determine their genuine meaning from\nan historical standpoint\u201d (1881\u201392, 1:iii). The\nextent to which Vaihinger resists allowing his own philosophical\ncommitments to influence his interpretation is indeed impressive. In\nfact, the very idea that understanding Kant\u2019s texts might\nrequire a distinctively historical kind of approach seems to have been\nsomething of a novelty and is among Vaihinger\u2019s lasting\ncontributions to Kant scholarship.\n\n\nThere are other important, and more substantive, respects in which the\nCommentary was at the vanguard of Kant scholarship. The\ndominant trend in the interpretation of Kant\u2019s theoretical\nphilosophy throughout most of the nineteenth century had been the\nphysio-psychological reading advanced by such figures as Schopenhauer,\nJakob Fries, Friedrich Beneke, J\u00fcrgen Bona Meyer, Helmholtz, and\nof course Lange (Beiser 2018, 64\u201372, 81\u201384; 2014,\n209\u201311, 460\u201363). According to this tradition, Kant\u2019s\nmain goal in the Critique was the discovery of the causal\nmechanisms underlying perception. Kant\u2019s conception of the\na priori was accordingly understood as referring to innate or\ningrained properties of the psychological subject that played an active\nrole in the construction of perception and acquisition of empirical\nknowledge. The first to break decisively with this tradition was\nprobably Hermann Cohen. Cohen (1871) highlighted the\nepistemological side of Kant\u2019s project\u2014his\ninterest in justifying various claims to knowledge.\nAccordingly, Cohen interpreted the a priori as referring to\nthe logical, rather than psychological, conditions of knowledge (1871,\n208). In this respect, Cohen\u2019s influence on the\nCommentary was decisive. Vaihinger insists at the outset that\nKant\u2019s \u201cphilosophy is, in the first instance,\nepistemology [Erkenntnistheorie]\u201d\n(1881\u201392, 1:8).\n\n\nVaihinger certainly does not, however, accept Cohen\u2019s\ninterpretation tout court. Though Cohen too had emphasized\nthe need for historical sensitivity in interpreting Kant, his aims\nwere ultimately still polemical: he believed more careful attention to\nKant\u2019s texts could exonerate his system from some of the\nperennial charges of inconsistency. For example, Kant\u2019s doctrine\nthat things in themselves exist independently of us and causally\naffect our minds to produce our representations had long been thought\nto violate his doctrine that the categories have validity only for\nobjects of possible experience. Another charge, very much alive at the\ntime, was that Kant\u2019s key arguments for the\nnon-spatiotemporality of things in themselves failed on the grounds\nthat they showed, at best, only the subjectivity of space and time,\nnot their mere subjectivity. According to this criticism,\nKant overlooked the possibility that space and time might\nbe both subjective forms of intuition and objective\nproperties of things in themselves (the classic statement of this\ncriticism is [Trendelenburg 1867]). Cohen\u2019s response to both\ncharges was to argue that interpreters were wrong to read Kant\u2019s\ndoctrine of things in themselves as positing a class of entities\nontologically distinct from appearances. Instead, he maintained, the\nKantian thing in itself is a mere \u201climiting concept\u201d\n(Grenzbegriff), to whose actual existence Kant was never\ncommitted (1871, 252, 268).\n\n\nVaihinger, by contrast, does not hesitate to admit that the above\nobjections are genuine problems for Kant. Indeed, he believes they\npinpoint serious inconsistencies in Kant\u2019s position. For\nexample, against Cohen\u2019s deflationary treatment of the thing in\nitself, Vaihinger notes, \u201cKant speaks thousands of times of\naffecting things in themselves; the impossibility of the existence and\ncausal efficacy of things in themselves is, by contrast, merely a\nconsequence that Kant\u2019s readers must certainly\ndraw from his theory of the categories, but which Kant himself\nhints at only seldom, and even then only timidly\u201d (1881\u201392,\n2:47) (the actual target of this remark is Fichte, but the point\napplies to Cohen\u2019s reading too). Vaihinger\u2019s goal in the\nCommentary is not to exonerate Kant from such inconsistencies,\nbut to explain why he fell into them. In particular, Vaihinger argues\nthat careful attention to both Kant\u2019s pre-critical writings and\nhis unpublished notes reveals that the Critique is really a\n\u201cpatchwork\u201d of inconsistent views and arguments from\nvarious periods of Kant\u2019s intellectual development. It consists\nof \u201cgeological strata which differ in both time of composition\nand content\u201d (1902, 27). In the case of the Deduction, Vaihinger\neven claims to have been able to trace precisely each portion of the\ntext to a particular series of notes from the decade between the\nDissertation and the KrV (1902). In this respect,\nthen, Kant\u2019s great book resembles more the texts of Homer than\nthe work of a single author, writing at a single time, with a single\nset of views.\n\n\nMore specifically, Vaihinger believes the development of Kant\u2019s\nthought proceeds through six stages. From 1750\u20131760 Kant is a\ndogmatic rationalist after the Leibnizian-Wolffian model.  Then, under\nthe influence of Locke and Hume, he endorses empiricism from\n1760\u20131764. With the publication of Dreams of a Spirit\nSeer, he begins to adopt the standpoint of the critical\nphilosophy, but by the time of the 1770 Inaugural\nDissertation, the influence of Leibniz (particularly of the\nNouveaux Essais) reasserts itself. This reversion to\ndogmatism lasts until 1772 when he becomes a skeptic, again under the\ninfluence of Hume. Finally, he arrives at the mature critical\nstandpoint with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 (1881\u201392, 1:47\u201349). Unfortunately, on\nVaihinger\u2019s reading, doctrines from the first five periods\ncontinue to figure in Kant\u2019s arguments for and even the core\ntenets of the critical philosophy. It is this which explains the\nnumerous inconsistencies besetting Kant\u2019s system.\n\n\nA clear example of Vaihinger\u2019s basic approach is his treatment\nof Kant\u2019s famous argument for the subjectivity of space from\nincongruent counterparts. In the Prolegomena, Kant argues\nthus:\n\n\n\nThere are no inner differences here [in the case of incongruent\ncounterparts] that any understanding could merely think; and yet the\ndifferences are inner as far as the senses teach \u2026 one\nhand\u2019s glove cannot be used on the other\u2026 . These objects\nare surely not representations of things as they are in themselves,\nand\nas the pure understanding would cognize them, rather, they are\nsensory intuitions, i.e., appearances. (4:286)\n\n\nRoughly, Vaihinger reconstructs the argument as follows: (1) Some\ndifferences in the spatial properties of objects cannot be known\nthrough the pure understanding; (2) All differences between things in\nthemselves can be known through the pure understanding; (C) Space is\nnot a thing in itself. Premise (2), however, violates Kant\u2019s\nnoumenal ignorance doctrine, according to which things in themselves\ncannot be known through the understanding\u2019s categories. Thus,\nVaihinger concludes, \u201cthis assumption [that things in themselves\nare knowable through the pure understanding] is obviously anathema to\nKantian criticism, and an archaic reversion to dogmatism\u201d\n(1881\u201392, 2:528). More specifically, his claim is that the\npremise is residue from Kant\u2019s view in the 1770\nDissertation, according to which things in themselves\nare objects as the pure understanding knows them\n(1881\u201392, 2:354, 453, 522).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s reading of the KrV, and especially of the\nDeduction, has become known as the \u201cpatchwork thesis.\u201d The\npatchwork reading has been influential in Anglophone scholarship, due\nlargely to its adoption by Norman Kemp Smith (1918), but it remains\ncontroversial. Since the reading apparently requires us to assume that\nKant failed to understand that combining views he knew were\ninconsistent with one another would produce a view that is itself\ninconsistent, it may be objected that, \u201cif such a conclusion is\ntrue, we must say that Immanuel Kant was either abnormally stupid, or\nelse that he took his thinking in a frivolous spirit\u201d (Paton\n1930, 157). However, the thesis that the Deduction, regardless of its\nprecise method of composition, at least contains multiple inconsistent\nlines of argument, rather than a single unified argument, has found\nable defenders since Vaihinger (see e.g., Wolff 1963; Guyer 1987). For a\nrecent challenge to this revised patchwork reading see (Allison\n2015).\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretive work during the 1880\u2019s and\n90\u2019s did not extend to the other major part of the KrV,\nthe Transcendental Dialectic. The PAO, however, includes a\nsupplementary appendix in which Vaihinger lays out a novel\ninterpretation of this chapter (PAO 201\u201335). The\nDialectic was the part of the KrV that clearly had the most\nsignificant impact on Vaihinger\u2019s own thought, and his\ninterpretation of it is radical and interesting. It will therefore be\nworth briefly examining before turning to the main argument of the\nPAO. \n\n\nIn the Dialectic, Kant claims that certain concepts (e.g., those of an\nimmaterial soul, freedom of the will, and God) have their root in pure\nreason. He argues that such concepts are mere \u201cIdeas\u201d\n(Ideen), in the sense that they are not constitutive\nprinciples of experience, and thus yield no \u201ccognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnis) of objects. Nevertheless, he suggests they are\n\u201cnot arbitrarily thought up\u201d (A 327/B 384), but have a\nnumber of important \u201cregulative\u201d uses. In his works on\nmoral philosophy, Kant goes on to argue that we can even have a\ncertain kind of \u201cpractical cognition\u201d of or\n\u201crational faith\u201d in the Ideas. A natural interpretation of\nKant\u2019s position regarding the Ideas holds that we lack\ntheoretical justification for believing that they refer to objects,\nand this lack of justification is such that we cannot claim knowledge\nof the existence or non-existence of such objects. Practical reason,\nhowever, may provide justification for the belief in (say) the\nexistence of God, even if not of a sort sufficient to yield knowledge\nof him. Vaihinger disputes this reading. Instead, he interprets the\nIdeas as self-conscious fictions, which are nevertheless licensed by\ntheir theoretical and practical utility. This utility justifies us in\n\u201cmaking use\u201d of such concepts\u2014looking, e.g., at\nnature as though it were the product of an intelligent\ndesigner\u2014but never in believing they refer to objects.\nThe interpretation relies crucially on two factors: first, a\nsuggestive passage in which Kant calls Ideas \u201cheuristic\nfictions\u201d (A 771/B 799), and contrasts them with hypotheses; and\nsecond, Kant\u2019s frequent use of \u2018als ob\u2019 and\nrelated locutions when describing the regulative employment of the\nIdeas. Both the distinction between fictions and hypotheses, and the\nidea of treating reality as if certain concepts appropriately\napplied to it are major themes that find extensive development in the\nPAO.\n\n\nVaihinger\u2019s interpretation of the Ideas as fictions is highly\ncontroversial, and was already subjected to withering criticism in his\nown day by Erich Adickes (1927). Adickes accuses Vaihinger of ignoring\ncountless passages that flatly contradict his fictionalist reading,\nand of misleadingly paraphrasing or eliding passages he does cite. In\none way, at least, this criticism is unfair. Vaihinger explicitly\nconcedes: \u201cin Kant we also find in the same contexts many\npassages which permit or even demand a contrary interpretation\u2026\n. Two tendencies are revealed, a critical and a dogmatic, a\nrevolutionary and a conservative\u201d (PAO\n212). Vaihinger\u2019s interpretation is not, unlike his work in\nthe Commentary, intended to be strictly historical; he is\nrather presenting one strand in Kant\u2019s thought that he finds\nespecially promising. Adickes nevertheless makes a compelling case\nthat even those passages on which Vaihinger does rely do not speak\ndecisively in favor of his interpretation. Most contemporary Kant\nscholars follow Adickes in rejecting the fictionalist interpretation\nof the Ideas, though it continues to find some supporters (see e.g.,\nShaper 1966; Korsgaard 1996, 162\u201376; and esp. Rauscher\n2015). \n",
