    "main_text": "Letting Yourself Do Harm\n9. Letting Yourself Do Harm\n\nRecent work raises another important challenge for defenders of the\nDoctrine of Doing and Allowing (see Persson 2013 and Hanna 2014,\n2015). The challenge is to provide an account of the moral status of\nallowing oneself to do or to have done harm. Consider: \n\nPoisoner: Earlier this morning, Agent deposited a dose of lethal\npoison into a teapot from which one person drinks tea at the same time\neach afternoon. Unless Agent warns her potential victim now, he will\ndrink the tea and\n die.[27]\n\nSpasm: Agent feels the onset of a spasm in her finger. If she does not\nrepress the spasm, her finger will contract around the trigger,\nsetting off a gun, killing Vic (Persson 2013, 96).\n\nAs Hanna points out, failure to warn the potential poison victim would\nnot be killing, instead Agent would be failing to prevent her past\nbehavior from constituting killing (Hanna 2014, 679). She would be\nallowing herself to have killed. Similarly, failure to repress the\nspasm seems significantly different from normally killing. It is\nperhaps best characterized as letting oneself (non-intentionally) kill\n(Persson 2013, 96).\n\nPersson suggests that deciding the moral status of allowing oneself to\nhave done harm requires us to choose between a\n\u201cpresent-self-focus\u201d, which gives primary importance to\nwhat you do now, and a \u201cself-other divide\u201d, based on the\ndifference between your own agency and agency that is external to you\n(Persson 2013, 102\u2013103). He argues that the neither of these is\nsatisfactory. The present-self focus is mysterious: \u201cwhy should\nwhat we are doing at the present time have this special\nimportance?\u201d (110). The self-other divide has \u201can air of\nrepulsive moral self-indulgence\u2026 why be especially concerned\nabout your own rights violations rather than the rights-violations of\nall people, in proportion to the stringency of the rights\nviolated?\u201d\n (110).[28]\n Persson has similar worries about holding that letting yourself kill\nnow is harder to justify than \u201cmerely\u201d letting die, even\nwhen the killing would not be intentional under any description. We\nmust place a lot of weight on whether a natural or non-intentional\ncause of death is external or internal to us. Persson challenges this\nidea: \u201cThe fact that a twitch is internal rather than external\nto us cannot make any moral difference\u201d (Persson 2013, 105).\n\nHanna\u2019s discussion of cases suggests that intuitively allowing\noneself to have done harm is neither morally equivalent to doing harm\nnor morally equivalent to merely allowing harm. Normally, if we face a\nchoice between merely allowing harm to one and merely allowing the\nsame harm to five, we should allow harm to one. However, if Agent\nfaces a choice between warning her potential poison victim and saving\nfive others from drowning, then intuitively, she is morally required\nto save the one potential poison victim. This suggests that allowing\noneself to have done harm is not morally equivalent to merely allowing\nharm (Hanna 2014, 678\u20139). If we face a choice between doing harm\nto one and doing the same harm to five, we should do harm to the one.\nBut suppose that Agent can give her warning and prevent the poisoning\nonly by driving down a narrow mountain path, which is blocked by the\nbody of an innocent, unconscious person. It seems impermissible for\nher to do so even if there are five people about to drink from the\npoisoned teapot. This suggests that allowing oneself to have done harm\nis not morally equivalent to doing harm (Hanna 2014, 681). This\nexacerbates the challenge for defenders of the Doctrine of Doing and\nAllowing for they must find a justification for treating the fact that\nthe Agent will be allowing herself to have done harm as somewhat\nmorally significant but not as so morally significant that it renders\nher current behaviour morally equivalent to doing\n harm.[29]\n In Persson\u2019s terms, we seem to need to defend both the\nself-other divide and the present-self-focus.\n\nThe cases from the literature on letting oneself do harm may seem\ncontrived. This may lead one to think that accounting for such cases\nis not a central issue for an account of the doing /allowing\ndistinction. Charlotte Franziska Unruh (2021) argues that such cases\nof letting oneself do harm are merely a subset of cases involving\ncomplicated causal chains where the agent is relevant to harm in more\nthan one way. Moreover, she argues, such cases arise frequently in\ncases involving future generations, for example, when we must make\ndecisions about whether to mitigate climate change resulting from our\npast carbon dioxide emissions.\n",
