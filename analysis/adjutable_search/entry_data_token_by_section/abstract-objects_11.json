    "main_text": "What is an Abstract Object? || The Way of Encoding\n3.6 The Way of Encoding\n\nOne of the most rigorous proposals about abstract objects has been\ndeveloped by Zalta (1983, 1988, and in a series of papers). It is a\nformal, axiomatic metaphysical theory of objects (both abstract and\nconcrete), and also includes a theory of properties, relations, and\npropositions. The theory explicitly defines the notion of an\nabstract object but also implicitly characterizes them using\n axioms.[9]\n There are three central aspects to the theory: (i) a predicate \\(E!\\)\nwhich applies to concrete entities and which is used to define a modal\ndistinction between abstract and ordinary objects;\n(ii) a distinction between exemplifying relations and\nencoding properties (i.e., encoding 1-place relations); and\n(iii) a comprehension schema that asserts the conditions under which\nabstract objects exist.\n\n(i) Since the theory has both a quantifier \\(\\exists\\) and a predicate\n\\(E!\\), Zalta offers two interpretations of his theory (1983,\n51\u20132; 1988, 103\u20134). On one interpretation, the quantifier\n\\(\\exists\\) simply asserts there is and the predicate \\(E!\\)\nasserts existence. On this interpretation, a formula such as\n\\(\\exists x \\neg E!x\\), which is implied by the axioms described\nbelow, asserts \u201cthere is an object that fails to exist\u201d.\nSo, on this interpretation, the theory is Meinongian because it\nendorses non-existent objects. But there is a Quinean interpretation\nas well, on which the quantifier \\(\\exists\\) asserts\nexistence and the predicate \\(E!\\) asserts\nconcreteness. On this interpretation, the formula \\(\\exists x\n\\neg E!x\\) asserts \u201cthere exists an object that fails to be\nconcrete\u201d. So, on this interpretation, the theory is Platonist,\nsince it doesn\u2019t endorse non-existents but rather asserts the\nexistence of non-concrete objects. We\u2019ll henceforth use the\nQuinean/Platonist interpretation.\n\nIn the more expressive, modal version of his theory, Zalta defines\nordinary objects \\((O!)\\) to be those that might be concrete.\nThe reason is that Zalta holds that possible objects (i.e., like\nmillion-carat diamonds, talking donkeys, etc.) are not concrete but\nrather possibly concrete. They exist, but they are not abstract, since\nabstract objects, like the number one, couldn\u2019t be concrete.\nIndeed, Zalta\u2019s theory implies that abstract objects \\((A!)\\)\naren\u2019t possibly concrete, since he defines them to be objects\nthat aren\u2019t ordinary (1993, 404):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nO!x &=_\\mathit{df} \\Diamond E!x \\\\\nA!x &=_\\mathit{df} \\neg O!x\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThus, the ordinary objects include all the concrete objects (since\n\\(E!x\\) implies \\(\\Diamond E!x\\)), as well as possible objects that\naren\u2019t in fact concrete but might have been. On this theory,\ntherefore, being abstract is not the negation of being\nconcrete. Instead, the definition validates an intuition that\nnumbers, sets, etc., aren\u2019t the kind of thing that could be\nconcrete. Though Zalta\u2019s definition of abstract seems\nto comport with the way of primitivism\u2014take\nconcrete as primitive, and then define abstract as\nnot possibly concrete\u2014it differs in that (a) axioms are\nstated that govern the conditions under which abstract objects exist\n(see below), and (b) the features commonly ascribed to abstract\nobjects are derived from principles that govern the property\nof being concrete. For example, Zalta accepts principles such as:\nnecessarily, anything with causal powers is concrete (i.e., \\(\\Box\n\\forall x(Cx \\to E!x)\\)). Then since abstract objects are, by\ndefinition, concrete at no possible world, they necessarily fail to\nhave causal powers.\n\n(ii) The distinction between exemplifying and\nencoding is a primitive one and is represented in the theory\nby two atomic formulas: \\(F^nx_1\\ldots x_n\\) \\((x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\)\nexemplify \\(F^n\\)) and \\(xF^1\\) \\((x\\) encodes\n\\(F^1).\\) While both ordinary and abstract objects exemplify\nproperties, only abstract objects encode\n properties;[10]\n it is axiomatic that ordinary objects necessarily fail to encode\nproperties \\((O!x \\to \\Box \\neg \\exists FxF).\\) Zalta\u2019s proposal\ncan be seen a positive metaphysical proposal distinct from all the\nothers we have considered; a positive proposal that uses encoding as a\nkey notion to characterize abstract objects. On this reading, the\ndefinitions and axioms of the theory convey what is meant by\nencoding and how it works. Intuitively, an abstract object\nencodes the properties by which we define or conceive of it,\nbut exemplifies some properties contingently and others necessarily.\nThus, the number 1 of Dedekind-Peano number theory encodes all and\nonly its number-theoretic properties, and whereas it contingently\nexemplifies the property being thought about by Peano, it\nnecessarily exemplifies properties such as being abstract,\nnot having a shape, not being a building, etc. The\ndistinction between exemplifying and encoding a property is also used\nto define identity: ordinary objects are identical whenever they\nnecessarily exemplify the same properties while abstract objects are\nidentical whenever they necessarily encode the same properties.\n\n(iii) The comprehension principle asserts that for each expressible\ncondition on properties, there is an abstract object that\nencodes exactly the properties that fulfill (satisfy) that\ncondition. Formally: \\(\\exists x(A!x \\:\\&\\: \\forall F(xF \\equiv\n\\phi))\\), where \\(\\phi\\) has no free \\(x\\)s. Each instance of this\nschema asserts the existence of an abstract object of a certain sort.\nSo, for example, where \u2018\\(s\\)\u2019 denotes Socrates, the\ninstance \\(\\exists x(A!x \\:\\&\\: \\forall F(xF \\equiv Fs))\\) asserts\nthat there is an abstract object that encodes exactly the properties\nthat Socrates exemplifies. Zalta uses this object to analyze the\ncomplete individual concept of Socrates. But any condition \\(\\phi\\) on\nconditions on properties with no free occurrences of \\(x\\) can be used\nto form an instance of comprehension. In fact, one can prove that the\nobject asserted to exist is unique, since there can\u2019t be two\ndistinct abstract objects that encode exactly the properties\nsatisfying \\(\\phi\\).\n\nThe theory that emerges from (i)\u2013(iii) is further developed\nwith additional axioms and definitions. One axiom asserts that if an\nobject encodes a property, it does so necessarily \\((xF \\to \\Box\nxF).\\) So the properties that an object encodes are not relative to\nany circumstance. Moreover, Zalta supplements his theory of abstract\nobjects with a theory of properties, relations, and propositions. Here\nwe describe only the theory of properties. It is governed by two\nprinciples: a comprehension principle for properties and a principle\nof identity. The comprehension principle asserts that for any\ncondition on objects expressible without encoding subformulas, there\nis a property \\(F\\) such that necessarily, an object \\(x\\) exemplifies\n\\(F\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is such that \\(\\phi\\), i.e., \\(\\exists\nF\\Box \\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\phi)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) has no encoding\nsubformulas and no free \\(F\\text{s}\\). The identity principle asserts\nthat properties \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are identical just in case \\(F\\) and\n\\(G\\) are necessarily encoded by the same objects, i.e., \\(F\\! =\\! G\n=_\\mathit{df} \\Box \\forall x(xF \\equiv xG)\\). This principle allows\none to assert that there are properties that are necessarily\nequivalent in the classical sense, i.e., in the sense that \\(\\Box\n\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\), but which are\n distinct.[11]\n\n\nSince \\(\\alpha\\! =\\! \\beta\\) is defined both when \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\) are both individual variables or both property variables,\nZalta employs the usual principle for the substitution of identicals.\nSince all of the terms in his system are rigid, substitution of\nidenticals preserves truth even in modal contexts.\n\nThe foregoing principles implicitly characterize both abstract and\nordinary objects. Zalta\u2019s theory doesn\u2019t postulate any\nconcrete objects, though, since that is a contingent matter. But his\nsystem does include the Barcan formula (i.e., \\(\\Diamond \\exists xFx\n\\to \\exists x\\Diamond Fx\\)), and so possiblity claims like\n\u201cthere might have been talking donkeys\u201d imply that there\nare (non-concrete) objects at our world that are talking donkeys at\nsome possible world. Since Zalta adopts the view that ordinary\nproperties like being a donkey necessarily imply concreteness, such\ncontingently nonconcrete objects are ordinary.\n\nZalta uses his theory to analyze Plato\u2019s Forms, concepts,\npossible worlds, Fregean numbers and Fregean senses, fictions, and\nmathematical objects and relations generally. However, some\nphilosophers see his comprehension principle as too inclusive, for in\naddition to these objects, it asserts that there are entities like\nthe round square or the set of all sets which are not\nmembers of themselves. The theory doesn\u2019t assert that\nanything exemplifies being round and being square\u2014the\ntheory preserves the classical form of predication without giving rise\nto contradictions. But it does assert that there is an abstract object\nthat encodes being round and being square, and that there is an\nabstract object that encodes the property of being a set that contains\nall and only non-self-membered sets. Zalta would respond by suggesting\nthat such objects are needed not only to state truth conditions, and\nexplain the logical consequences, of sentences involving expressions\nlike \u201cthe round square\u201d and \u201cthe Russell set\u201d,\nbut also to analyze the fictional characters of inconsistent stories\nand inconsistent theories (e.g., Fregean extensions).\n\nIt should be noted that Zalta\u2019s comprehension principle for\nabstract objects is unrestricted and so constitutes a\nplenitude principle. This allows the theory to provide\nobjects for arbitrary mathematical theories. Where \\(\\tau\\) is a term\nof mathematical theory \\(T\\), the comprehension principle yields a\nunique object that encodes all and only the properties \\(F\\) that are\nattributed to \\(\\tau\\) in \\(T\\) (Linsky & Zalta 1995,\nNodelman & Zalta\n 2014).[12]\n Zalta\u2019s theory therefore offers significant explanatory power,\nfor it has multiple applications and advances solutions to a wide\nrange of puzzles in different fields of\n philosophy.[13]\n\n",
