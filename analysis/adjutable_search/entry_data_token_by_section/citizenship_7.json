    "main_text": "The challenge of globalisation || Citizens, non-citizens, and rights\n3.2 Citizens, non-citizens, and rights\n\nShould one infer from the preceding discussion that citizenship is\n\u201chard on the outside and soft on the inside\u201d (Bosniak\n2006, 4) with the border representing a firm line between those who\nare part of the community of equal citizens and those who remain\noutside? The short answer is no. International migration produces what\nBaub\u00f6ck calls a \u201cmismatch between citizenship and the\nterritorial scope of legitimate authority\u201d with \u201ccitizens\nliving outside the country whose government is supposed to be\naccountable to them and inside a country whose government is not\naccountable to them\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 31). To resident aliens\nwho live within a specific community of citizens, the border is not\nsomething they have left behind, it effectively follows them inside\nthe state, denying them many of the rights enjoyed by full citizens or\nmaking their enjoyment less secure (Bosniak 2006).\n\nOne way to address this mismatch is to reconsider how entitlement to\ncitizenship is determined. In a world characterized by significant\nlevels of migration across states, birthright citizenship \u2014\nacquired either through descent (jus sanguinis) or birth in\nthe territory (jus soli) \u2014 may lead to counterintuitive\nresults: while a regime of pure jus sanguinis systematically\nexcludes immigrants and their children, though the latter may be born\nand bred in their parents\u2019 new home, it includes descendants of\nexpatriates who may never have set foot in their forebears\u2019\nhomeland. On the other hand, a regime of jus soli may\nattribute citizenship to children whose birth in the territory is\naccidental while denying it to those children who have arrived in the\ncountry at a very young age.\n\nThe stakeholder principle (or jus nexi) is proposed as an\nalternative (or a supplement) to birthright citizenship: individuals\nwho have a \u201creal and effective link\u201d (Shachar 2009, 165)\nto the political community, or a \u201cpermanent interest in\nmembership\u201d (Baub\u00f6ck 2008, 35) should be entitled to claim\ncitizenship. This new criterion aims at securing citizenship for those\nwho are truly members of the political community, in the sense that\ntheir life prospects depend on the country\u2019s laws and policy\nchoices.\n\nIf the stakeholder principle alleviates the mismatch, it does not\nquestion the tight association between rights, citizenship, territory,\nand authority. For some, it is precisely this association that should\nbe questioned since it contradicts the increasing fluidity of the\nrelations between individuals and polities in a globalized world. This\ncontext is thought to necessitate more than a friendly amendment to\ncurrent principles of citizenship allocation: it requires the\ndisaggregation of rights, commonly associated with citizenship, from\nthe legal status of\n citizen.[19]\n This process is thought to have already begun in contemporary\ndemocracies since, as noted above, many of the civil and social rights\nassociated with citizenship are now extended to all individuals\nresiding in the state, notwithstanding their legal status. Political\nrights to participation should likewise be extended to resident\nnoncitizens, and perhaps even to those \u201cnoncitizen\nnonresidents\u201d who have fundamental interests that are affected\nby a particular state (Song 2009).\n\nThe emergence of human rights instruments at the international level\nhas lent some credibility to the perspective of a deterritorialization\nof rights regimes and the possibility of securing a person\u2019s\nbasic rights irrespective of her formal membership status in a given\npolity. In this context, it is not in virtue of our (particular)\ncitizenship that we are recognized rights, but in virtue of our\n(universal) personhood.\n\nOver and above diverging assessments of the empirical plausibility of\nunbundling, some authors highlight the risks involved and contest its\ndesirability. Stable citizenship regimes \u201cpromote internal\nredistribution and support co-governance\u201d. \u201c[B]y\nencouraging the dissolution of the bundle of benefits and protections\nthat currently attach to citizenship, proponents of the unbundling\nvision will also begin to fuel an alternative discourse as well\n\u2013 one that urges the privatization and fragmentation of\ncitizenship, and that implies less collective responsibility for the\nwell being of members\u201d (Shachar 2009, 67).\n\nThe debate over voting rights, in particular, is complex and covers\nboth external (extending voting rights to nonresident citizens) and\ninternal voting (expanding the franchise to resident non-citizens).\nTheorists with sympathies to the social membership thesis (arguing\nthat residence over time in a specific territory is the key to\nmembership in a society) or to the stakeholder conception of\ncitizenship usually consider that long-term residence in a country\nshould be the basis for the allocation of democratic rights. The\nargument may cover not only migrants who qualify for permanent\nresident status, but also those who have entered illegally in the\ncountry (Carens 2010b, 2013) as well as temporary migrants, in\nparticular \u2018guest workers\u2019 who are often denied any access\nto citizenship (Lenard 2015). On this view, safety from deportation\nand the entitlement to the state\u2019s protection when abroad is\nwhat distinguishes citizens from resident noncitizens. Citizenship\nrights are understood as extra-territorial (\u201cthey follow the\ncitizen rather than the territory\u201d) while voting rights are best\nunderstood as territorial (Lenard 2015,\n 131).[20]\n\nThough some states do extend voting rights to resident noncitizens at\nthe local level, it is the growing extension of voting rights to\nnonresident citizens over the last decades that is particularly\nstriking (Pogonyi 2014). It shows the persistence of a conception of\nmembership premised on understanding the nation-state as a historical\ncommunity of citizens with common values and shared ethno-cultural\ntraits. On this view, voting rights are not understood territorially,\nbut follow the citizen when she settles outside of her home country.\nThough one can understand some of the pragmatic reasons that often\nmotivate states to recognize voting rights to expatriates (e.g.\nacknowledging and encouraging their continued contribution to the home\ncountry through payment of remittances), normative theorists have been\nmostly critical of this phenomenon (see especially Lopez-Guerra 2005).\nThe policy followed by certain states of the former socialist\nfederations (USSR and Yugoslavia) of recognizing voting rights to\nco-ethnics residing in territories integrated in neighbouring\nindependent states, as well as the more recent decisions by states\nlike Hungary and Romania to extend voting rights to trans-border\nethnic kin populations, should alert us to the dangers to regional\nstability that the \u201cre-ethnicization of citizenship\u201d\ninvolve (Joppke 2005, cited by Pogonyi 2014; see also Pogonyi 2023).\nMoreover, where the electoral system is not designed to limit the\npotential political impact of the nonresident electoral body, external\nvoting may effect the \u201cresident constituency\u2019s right to\ndemocratic self-determination\u201d (Pogonyi 2014, 135-136).\n\nThe rise of \u201ccash-for-passports\u201d programs over the last\nten years in many liberal states is yet another sign of an increasing\n\u201cprivatization and fragmentation of citizenship\u201d. These\nprograms \u2013 like the one introduced by the government of Malta in\nOctober 2013 \u2013 have provoked a heated debate over normative\nissues (Shachar and Hirschl 2014; Shachar 2017; Hidalgo 2016; Joppke\n2019; Erez 2021; Irving\n 2022).[21]\n There are two main objections. First, these programs raise issues of\nfairness towards other potential immigrants lacking the resources to\nqualify as well as towards those who remain in the country of origin.\nSecond, they represent a government-induced commodification of\ncitizenship that may distort the citizens\u2019 understanding of the\nkind of commitment to the political community and to co-citizens that\ncitizenship entails. In contrast, those who refuse to condemn investor\ncitizenship programs point to the normative inconsistencies that often\npermeate their critics\u2019 accounts. Is it consistent to defend a\nstate\u2019s right to restrict immigration while claiming that it is\nnot permissible for states to sell foreigners access to the country\n(Hidalgo 2016)? Can one reject as unethical investment-based criteria\nfor immigration while condoning skilled-based criteria (Erez 2022)?\nCan one criticize citizen-investors for not residing in their new\ncountry while not condemning those who acquire dual citizenship (based\non ancestry or descent) without having any serious intention of\nresiding in the state (Irving\n 2022)?[22]\n Other theorists emphasize that worries over the corrupting effect of\ncash-for-passports schemes are premised on a conception of citizenship\nthat gives an overblown importance to its political dimension in an\nage of decreasing participation in democratic institutions (e.g.\nvoting, membership in political parties, etc.). One should face\nsquarely the fact that citizenship is essentially about the\nopportunities and protection that passports issued by certain states\nprovide to individuals (Kochenov 2018). For those who share\nShachar\u2019s robust view of citizenship, the depressing reality may\nwell be that investor citizenship programs are more a symptom than a\ncause of the larger malaise provoked by the \u201cmaterial forces of\nglobalization\u201d (Spiro 2018, 19; see also Joppke 2019,\n866\u2013867).\n",
