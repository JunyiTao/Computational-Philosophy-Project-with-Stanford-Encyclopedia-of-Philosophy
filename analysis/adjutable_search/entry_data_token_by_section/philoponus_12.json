    "main_text": "Influence\n5. Influence\n\n\nDespite arousing the disapproval of many of his contemporaries, both\npagan and Christian, Philoponus\u2019 immediate influence may have been\nconsiderable among fellow-monophysites in Egypt. The anathema of 681,\nhowever, made the further proliferation of his theological ideas\nimpossible. Likewise, his arch-enemy Simplicius, also a pupil of\nAmmonius, submitted the Grammarian\u2019s anti-eternalism almost\nimmediately to thundering pro-Aristotelian criticism (in his\ncommentaries on the De Caelo and the Physics,\nwritten sometime in the late 530s). It was that polemic which\nresounded through the ages; its shockwaves can still be felt in later\nthinkers like Thomas Aquinas (1224\u20131274) and Zabarella (1533\u20131589) who\ncarefully examined, though in the end rejected, Philoponus\u2019\nanti-eternalist arguments.  Philoponus\u2019 work was studied extensively\nby the Arabs, who referred to him as Yahy\u00e2 an-Nahw\u00ee or\nYahy\u00e2 al-\u2018Asqal\u00e2n\u00ee. Al-Kindi (ca. 800\u2013870)\nin particular is heavily indebted to Philoponus for his own attack on\neternalism. Later on in the West, the arguments against the eternity\nof the world also persuaded Bonaventure (1217\u20131274) and Gersonides\n(1288\u20131344), and impetus theory was reaffirmed by Buridan (1300\u20131361)\nand his pupil Oresme (1325\u20131382).  In the sixteenth century, the first\neditions and numerous translations (into Latin) of Philoponus\u2019\ncommentaries and the treatise Against Proclus began to appear\nin print. Eventually, Philoponus\u2019 criticism of Aristotelian dynamics\nin the Physics commentary was widely discussed and persuaded\nsuch diverse thinkers as Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola\n(1469\u20131533) and, for different reasons, Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642). In a sense, Philoponus is a Renaissance figure avant la lettre. However, historically positioned at a half way point between the Classical period and the Renaissance, he symbolizes more than anything else the Western mind\u2019s excruciatingly slow struggle for emancipation from Aristotelianism on the one hand and blind faith in Church dogma on the other. \n",
