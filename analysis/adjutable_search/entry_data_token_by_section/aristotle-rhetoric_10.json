    "main_text": "The Three Means of Persuasion || Persuasion Through the Emotions of the Hearer\n5.2 Persuasion Through the Emotions of the Hearer\n\nWith regard to the hearer, persuasion comes about whenever the hearers\nare led by the speech to feel a certain emotion or passion that, in\nturn, has an impact on the judgement they are going to make. The\nunderlying assumption of this persuasive technique is that\npeople\u2019s emotional states broadly conceived \u2014 i.e. whether\nthey actually undergo an episode of emotion or not and what kind of\nemotion they feel \u2014 makes a difference for the formation of the\njudgement they are about to pass. Indeed, Aristotle even introduces\nthe emotions or passions (path\u00ea) in an important\npassage (Rhet. II.1, 1378a20\u201330) by saying that they\nare \u201cthose things due to which people, by undergoing a change,\ndiffer in their judgements ...\u201d. He illustrates this\ngeneral assumption by pointing out that we do not judge in the same\nway when we grieve and rejoice or when we are friendly and hostile. It\ntherefore seems that the speaker has to arouse emotions exactly\nbecause emotions have the power to modify our judgments: e.g. to a\njuror or judge who is in a friendly mood, the person about whom he or\nshe is going to judge seems not to do wrong or only in a small way;\nbut to the juror or judge who is in an angry mood, the same person\nwill seem to do the opposite (see Rhet. II.1, 1378a1ff.).\nSince rhetoric aims at steering the hearers\u2019 judgement and since\nemotions, thus, have a significant impact on the formation of\njudgements (on the various ways how emotions, according to Aristotle,\ncan alter our judgements see Leighton 1982), the rhetorical method\nrequires to address the emotional states of the hearers, if only in\norder to calm down adverse feelings or emotions that are likely to\nprevent the jurors or judges from forming their judgement in\naccordance with the presented evidence and arguments.\n\nSome scholars writing on the rhetorical use of emotions take it to be\nsignificant that emotions also play a crucial role in\nAristotle\u2019s moral philosophy, for Aristotle defines the virtuous\nperson not only by performing the right actions, but also by having\nand by being motivated through the appropriate sort of emotions.\nApplying this to the rhetorical situation, one might wonder whether in\nAristotle\u2019s art of rhetoric the speaker tries to arouse\nemotions, in order (i) to motivate the audience (e.g. motivate them to\nact in accordance with the judgement they pass) or (ii) to turn them\ninto better persons (e.g. by providing and making them familiar with\nthe appropriate emotions that are definitory of the virtuous persons).\nHowever, both options are not backed by the evidence given in the text\nof the Rhetoric. With regard to (i), it seems crucial to note\nthat the aim of rhetorical persuasion is a certain judgement\n(krisis), not an action or practical decision\n(prohairesis), which would intrinsically involve a specific\nsort of desire and motivation (see e.g. Kontos 2021, 20\u201331).\nWhile the practical decision that Aristotle discusses in his ethical\nwritings is always about things the agents themselves are able to do,\nthe judgements of the hearers of a public speech are often about\nthings to be done by other agents or about actions that took place in\nthe past. With regard to (ii), one might be reluctant to accept that\nmoral education might be the direct purpose of the kind of public\nspeeches Aristotle has in mind. At least, no such moral purpose is\nmentioned when Aristotle addresses the purpose and use of rhetoric\n(see above\n \u00a7 4).\n It is also significant that the appropriateness of the aroused\nemotions (in accordance with Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the mean) is\nnowhere discussed in the Rhetoric. More than that, Aristotle\nseems to think that moral education requires individual habituation\nand habituation is a matter of gradually adjusting a person\u2019s\nattitudes and hedonic responses, while the uneducated ones are not\nreally responsive to disciplinary allocutions. For all these reasons,\nhe is not too optimistic with regard to the pedagogical effect of\npublic speeches: \u201cNow if speeches were in themselves enough to\nmake men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very\ngreat rewards, and such rewards should have been provided; but as\nthings are \u2026 they are not able to encourage the many to\nnobility and goodness\u201d (EN X.9, 1179b4\u201310).\n\nBut how is it possible for the orator, in the first place, to lead the\naudience to feel a certain emotion? After all, the technical means of\npersuasion are restricted to what the speakers say in a\nspeech. It is remarkable that Aristotle\u2019s treatment of several\ntypes of emotions in Chapters 2\u201311 of Rhet. II is based\non the definition of each type of emotion. Even though Aristotle\nmostly leaves it to the reader to infer how these definitions are\nuseful for arousing a particular type of emotion, it seems safe to\nconclude that these definitions are meant to offer the key to the\nmethodical arousal of emotions in the audience. Let, for example,\nanger be defined as \u201cdesire, accompanied with pain, for\nconspicuous revenge for a conspicuous slight that was directed against\noneself or those near to one, when such a slight is undeserved.\u201d\n(Rhet. II.2 1378a31\u201333). According to such a\ndefinition, someone who takes it to be the case that he or she has\nsuffered a slight from a person who is not entitled to do so, etc.,\nwill, all other things being equal, become angry. Obviously, this\npresupposes an account of emotions according to which emotions are\nclosely related to what people think or take to be the case.\nUnfortunately and owing to the overall nature of Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric, this underlying account of emotion is nowhere\nexplicitly unfolded and defended. What we can infer though is that\nAristotle assumes at least a covariance between someone\u2019s\nthought or opinion that she has been slighted undeservedly and her\nfeeling of anger. If that much is granted and if the speakers have\naccess to such definitions of each type of emotions, it is possible to\ndeduce conditions under which a person is likely to feel this\nparticular type of emotion. And if the speakers manage to make the\nhearers think \u2014 by what they say \u2014 that these conditions\nare given, it is likely, as far as this method goes, that the hearers\nwill feel the corresponding emotion. Aristotle himself suggests the\nfollowing example. If we take the above-mentioned definition of anger\nfor granted, it is possible to deduce circumstances in which a person\nwill become angry; most notably, we can deduce (i) in what state of\nmind people are angry and (ii) against whom they are angry and (iii)\nfor what sorts of reason. If we want to make an audience angry, we\nhave to address all three factors, making the hearers think (ii) that\nthere are people who deserve their anger, (iii) that there is a reason\nfor being angry (a slight, an insult, a belittlement, etc.) and (i) by\nbringing them into a state of mind in which they are prone to anger.\nAristotle himself shows how to deduce these three factors for each\nparticular type of emotion throughout chapters II.2\u201311. With\nthis equipment, the speaker will be able, for example, to highlight\nsuch characteristics of a case as are likely to provoke anger in the\naudience. In comparison with the tricks of former rhetoricians (which,\nAristotle thinks, are bound to speak \u201coutside the\nsubject\u201d), this method of arousing emotions has a striking\nadvantage: The speaker who wants to arouse emotions need not even\nspeak \u201coutside the subject\u201d or distract from the thing at\nissue; it is sufficient to detect aspects of a given subject that are\nconnected with the intended emotion and to make the addressee think\nthat certain emotion-provoking aspects, in accordance with the three\nfactors mentioned above, are given.\n\nSupplement on Judgemental and Non-Judgemental Accounts of Aristotelian Emotions\n\n",
