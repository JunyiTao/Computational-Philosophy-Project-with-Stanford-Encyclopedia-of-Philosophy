    "main_text": "Welfare\n2. Welfare\n\nClassical utitilitarians (i.e., Jeremy Bentham, J.S. Mill, and Henry\nSidgwick) took benefit and harm to be purely a matter of pleasure and\npain. The view that welfare is a matter of pleasure minus pain has\ngenerally been called hedonism. It has grown in sophistication (Parfit\n1984: Appendix I; Sumner 1996; Crisp 2006; de Lazari-Radek and Singer\n2014: ch. 9) but remains committed to the thesis that how well\nsomeone\u2019s life goes depends entirely on his or her\npleasure minus pain, albeit with pleasure and pain being construed\nvery broadly.\n\nEven if pleasures and pains are construed very broadly, hedonism\nencounters difficulties. The main one is that many (if not all) people\ncare very strongly about things other than their own pleasures and\npains. Of course these other things can be important as means to\npleasures and to the avoidance of pain. But many people care very\nstrongly about things over and beyond their hedonistic instrumental\nvalue. For example, many people want to know the truth about various\nmatters even if this won\u2019t increase their (or anyone\nelse\u2019s) pleasure. Another example is that many people care about\nachieving things over and beyond the pleasure such achievements might\nproduce. Again, many people care about the welfare of their family and\nfriends in a non-instrumental way. A rival account of these points,\nespecially the last, is that people care about many things other than\ntheir own welfare.\n\nOn any plausible view of welfare, the satisfaction people can feel\nwhen their desires are fulfilled constitutes an addition to their\nwelfare. Likewise, on any plausible view, frustration felt as a result\nof unfulfilled desires constitutes a reduction in welfare. What is\ncontroversial is whether the fulfilment of someone\u2019s desire\nconstitutes a benefit to that person apart from any effect that the\nfulfilment of the desire has on that person\u2019s felt satisfaction\nor frustration. Hedonism answers No, claiming that only effects on\nfelt satisfaction or felt frustration matter.\n\nA different theory of welfare answers Yes. This theory holds that the\nfulfilment of any desire of the agent\u2019s constitutes a benefit to\nthe agent, even if the agent never knows that desire has been\nfulfilled and even if the agent derives no pleasure from its\nfulfilment. This theory of human welfare is often referred to as the\ndesire-fulfillment theory of welfare.\n\nClearly, the desire-fulfillment theory of welfare is broader than\nhedonism, in that the desire-fulfillment theory accepts that what can\nconstitute a benefit is wider than merely pleasure. But there are\nreasons for thinking that this broader theory is too broad. For one\nthing, people can have sensible desires that are simply too\ndisconnected from their own lives to be relevant to their own welfare\n(Williams 1973a: 262; Overvold 1980, 1982; Parfit 1984: 494). I desire\nthat the starving in far-away countries get food. But the fulfilment\nof this desire of mine does not benefit me.\n\nFor another thing, people can have desires for absurd things for\nthemselves. Suppose I desire to count all the blades of grass in the\nlawns on this road. If I get satisfaction out of doing this, the felt\nsatisfaction constitutes a benefit to me. But the bare fulfilment of\nmy desire to count all the blades of grass in the lawns on this road\ndoes not (Rawls 1971: 432; Parfit 1984: 500; Crisp 1997: 56).\n\nOn careful reflection, we might think that the fulfilment of\nsomeone\u2019s desire constitutes an addition to that person\u2019s\nwelfare if and only if that desire has one of a certain set\nof contents. We might think, for example, that the fulfilment of\nsomeone\u2019s desire for pleasure, friendship, knowledge,\nachievement, or autonomy for herself does constitute an\naddition to her welfare, and that the fulfilment of any desires she\nmight have for things that do not fall into these categories do not\ndirectly benefit her (though, again, the pleasure she derives from\ntheir satisfaction does). If we think this, it seems we think there is\na list of things that constitute anyone\u2019s welfare (Parfit 1984:\nAppendix I; Brink 1989: 221\u201336; Griffin 1996: ch. 2; Crisp 1997:\nch. 3; Gert 1998: 92\u20134; Arneson 1999a).\n\nInsofar as the goods to be promoted are parts of welfare, the theory\nremains utilitarian. There is a lot to be said for utilitarianism.\nObviously, how lives go is important. And there is something deeply\nattractive (if not downright irresistible) in the idea that morality\nis fundamentally impartial, i.e., the idea that, at the most\nfundamental level of morality, everyone is equally important \u2014\nwomen and men, strong and weak, rich and poor, Blacks, Whites,\nHispanics, Asians, etc. And utilitarianism plausibly interprets this\nequal importance as dictating that in the calculation of overall\nwelfare a benefit or harm to any one individual counts neither more\nnor less that the same size benefit or harm to any other\nindividual.\n",
