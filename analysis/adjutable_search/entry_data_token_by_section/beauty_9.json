    "main_text": "The Politics of Beauty || The Feminist Critique\n3.2 The Feminist Critique\n\nAs we have seen, the association of beauty with the erotic is\nproverbial from Sappho and is emphasized relentlessly by figures such\nas Burke and Nehamas. But the erotic is not a neutral or universal\nsite, and we need to ask whose sexuality is in play in the history of\nbeauty, with what effects. This history, particularly in the West and\nas many feminist theorists and historians have emphasized, is\nassociated with the objectification and exploitation of women.\nFeminists beginning in the 19th century gave fundamental critiques of\nthe use of beauty as a set of norms to control women\u2019s bodies or\nto constrain their self-presentation and even their self-image in\nprofound and disabling ways (see Wollstonecraft 1792, Grimk\u00e9\n1837).\n\nIn patriarchal society, as Catherine MacKinnon puts it, the content of\nsexuality \u201cis the gaze that constructs women as objects for male\npleasure. I draw on pornography for its form and content,\u201d she\ncontinues, describing her treatment of the subject, \u201cfor the\ngaze that eroticizes the despised, the demeaned, the accessible, the\nthere-to-be-used, the servile, the child-like, the passive, and the\nanimal. That is the content of sexuality that defines gender\nfemale in this culture, and visual thingification is its method\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1987, 53\u20134). Laura Mulvey, in \u201cVisual Pleasure\nand Narrative Cinema,\u201d reaches one variety of radical critique\nand conclusion: \u201cIt is said that analyzing pleasure, or beauty,\ndestroys it. That is the intention of this article\u201d (Mulvey\n1975, 60).\n\nMulvey\u2019s psychoanalytic treatment was focused on the scopophilia\n(a Freudian term denoting neurotic sexual pleasure configured around\nlooking) of Hollywood films, in which men appeared as protagonists,\nand women as decorative or sexual objects for the pleasure of the male\ncharacters and male audience-members. She locates beauty \u201cat the\nheart of our oppression.\u201d And she appears to have a hedonist\nconception of it: beauty engenders pleasure. But some pleasures, like\nsome kisses, are sadistic or exploitative at the individual and at the\nsocietal level. Art historians such as Linda Nochlin (1988) and\nGriselda Pollock (1987) brought such insights to bear on the history\nof painting, for example, where the scopophilia is all too evident in\nfamous nudes such as Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino or\nVelazquez\u2019s Rokeby Venus, which a feminist slashed with\nknife in 1914 because \u201cshe didn\u2019t like the way men gawked\nat it\u201d.\n\nFeminists such as Naomi Wolf in her book The Beauty Myth,\ngeneralized such insights into a critique of the ways women are\nrepresented throughout Western popular culture: in advertising, for\nexample, or music videos. Such practices have the effect of\nconstraining women to certain acceptable ways of presenting themselves\npublicly, which in turn greatly constrains how seriously they are\ntaken, or how much of themselves they can express in public space. As\nhave many other commentators, Wolf connects the representation of the\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d female body, in Western high art but\nespecially in popular culture, to eating disorders and many other\nself-destructive behaviors, and indicates that a real overturning of\ngender hierarchy will require deeply re-construing the concept of\nbeauty.\n\nThe demand on women to create a beautiful self-presentation by male\nstandards, Wolf argues, fundamentally compromises women\u2019s action\nand self-understanding, and makes fully human relationships between\nmen and women difficult or impossible. In this Wolf follows, among\nothers, the French thinker Luce Irigaray, who wrote that \u201cFemale\nbeauty is always considered as finery ultimately designed to attract\nthe other into the self. It is almost never perceived as a\nmanifestation of, an appearance of, a phenomenon expressive of\ninteriority \u2013 whether of love, of thought, of flesh. We look at\nourselves in the mirror to please someone, rarely to\ninterrogate the state of our body or our spirit, rarely for ourselves\nand in search of our becoming\u201d (quoted in Robinson 2000,\n230).\n\n\u201cSex is held hostage by beauty,\u201d Wolf remarks, \u201cand\nits ransom terms are engraved in girls\u2019 minds early and deeply\nwith instruments more beautiful that those which advertisers or\npornographers know how to use: literature, poetry, painting, and\nfilm\u201d (Wolf 1991f, 157).\n",
