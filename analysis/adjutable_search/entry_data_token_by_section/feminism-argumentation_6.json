    "main_text": "Other Goals for and Styles of Arguing || Knowledge and criticism\n2.3 Knowledge and criticism\n\nEven feminists with concerns about adversarial reasoning recognize\nthat it promotes criticism that may advance the goal of attaining\nknowledge and understanding. Knowledge is an important purpose among\nthose that arguing serves and different styles of arguing can serve\ndifferent purposes. Some efforts to build knowledge may benefit from\nthe adversarial styles and models, especially if arguers can avoid\nautomatically slipping into hostile, \u201cancillary\u201d modes of\naggression (Govier 1999). Arguers may also need to avoid reinforcing\nother epistemic cultures and subcultures that prioritize men\u2019s\ninteraction with each other (Rooney 2012). So feminists need norms for\narguing that support criticism of such androcentric cultures and\npractices and the development of knowledge about how such systems\nfunction.\n\nNon-adversarial models of reasoning such as coalescent argumentation\nmay aid people\u2019s understanding too, especially about others and\ntheir positions. Mutual understanding develops from coalescent arguing\nbecause it demands finding common ground. The remaining opposition\namong people and their beliefs constitutes a minimally adversarial\norientation that Trudy Govier (1999) and Rooney (2010) argue may be\nvaluable for both the development of arguments and the role of arguing\nin the processes that generate knowledge. Arguers can aid each other\nin achieving knowledge, which is the main goal in academic arguing,\ndespite the fact that academics sometimes can be side-tracked by\nmundane power play.\n\nBecause of overarching epistemic purposes, Cohen suggests that the\npeople whose ideas lose in eristic debate thus may benefit the most\nbecause they learn the most (1995: 182). People may also share an\ninquiry (Dutilh Novaes 2015: 598\u2013599), and epistemic benefit may\naccrue to communities. The discursive practices in which individual\nscientists work together by testing each other\u2019s claims may\nexhibit certain characteristics that Helen Longino\u2019s (1990)\nmodel of scientific reasoning sees as supporting a form of\nobjectivity. Longino\u2019s account of objectivity addresses feminist\nconcerns with about gender bias in scientific theories and involves\nboth collaborative and adversarial elements.\n\nSuch shared epistemic projects among people might be understood as\n\u201carguing with\u201d rather than \u201cagainst\u201d other\nreasoners (Rooney 2003). Rooney argues that readily available logical\nterms such as \u201ccontradictory\u201d and \u201ccontrary\u201d\ncan adequately describe differing opinions without implicating\nopposition among the people holding divergent views (2003; 2010: 222).\nSuch language may help reasoners move away from both the Adversary\nMethod\u2019s dominance as a Paradigm and eristic arguing that may be\notherwise dysfunctional. The negative connotations of\n\u201cargument\u201d and \u201carguing\u201d in the English\nlanguage may be part of the\n problem.[4]\n Related words in other Indo-European languages carry no such\nimplication of verbal fighting (Hitchcock 2017: 449). Avoiding the\nEnglish-language connotations is part of the reason theorists often\nspeak instead of \u201cargumentation\u201d even though that\nterminology can be unclear or unnecessarily abstract.\n\nYet, criticism must be part of feminism, especially to direct it at\nsexism, and feminists may be no more skilled than anyone else at\navoiding the pitfalls of arguing such as its tendency to aggravate\nconflict. Feminist models of arguing avoid levelling criticism against\npeople and direct it toward the views they hold so as to better serve\neveryone\u2019s understanding. Feminist models of arguing and some\nways of arguing used by feminists and non-feminists alike exhibit a\nbenevolent attentiveness to other arguers in the processes of arguing\nand yet they may also subject what other people say to extensive\ncriticism and opposition.\n\nAccording to Govier, the characteristic explicitness of reasoning when\npeople argue enables them to learn from disagreement and doubt (1999).\nExplicitness also promotes honesty with ourselves and each other and\nrespect for interpersonal differences:\n\n\nan arguer, in actually or potentially addressing those who differ, is\ncommitted to the recognition that people may think differently and\nthat what they think and why they think it matters. (1999: 8, 50)\n\n\nFeminist criticism often involves anger, an emotion also regularly\nassociated with arguing. Anger can be a distracting or even\ndestructive influence on reasoning and it can signify harmful\narrogance (Tanesini 2018). Moira Howes and Catherine Hundleby make a\ncase that arguing can help derive cognitive benefit from anger because\narguing encourages reasoners to express and to articulate their\nreasons (2018). It can reveal aspects of reasoning that otherwise\nwould remain unconscious, a feature of arguing processes that Douglas\nWalton identifies as the \u201cmaieutic effect\u201d (1992).\n\nStyles for communicating and sharing reasons often distinguished as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d also play roles in feminist epistemologies of\nargumentation: Gilbert assigns a fundamental role in coalescent\nargumentation to the values of attention to the speaker and seeking\nagreement, while Linker characterizes empathetic intellectuals as\nhaving the skills of cooperation and accepting vulnerability. Feminist\nethical goals of accountability to women thus can benefit from the\npursuit of knowledge. Not only for feminists but for all reasoners,\nthe ethical value of understanding other people can enhance the\nstandard philosophical treatment of arguments as logical\npremise-conclusion complexes. Coalescent and intellectually empathic\nreasoning complement critical analysis once we distinguish criticism\nfrom the eristic culture of aggressive fault-finding (Miller\n1995).\n",
