    "main_text": "Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka || The Two Truths\n2.1 The Two Truths\n\nThe theory of the two truths, or two realities, is fundamental to\nMadhyamaka philosophy. Reality can be classified in terms of the\nconventional truth (or conventional reality), which corresponds to the\nway that things appear to ordinary persons, and the ultimate truth (or\nultimate reality), which corresponds to the way that things really\nare. While M\u0101dhyamikas tend to disagree about the nature of and\nrelationship between the conventional and ultimate truths, the final\ngoal of Madhyamaka philosophy involves realizing the ultimate truth\n\u2013 seeing things not just as they appear, but as they really\nare.\n\nGorampa argues that the distinction between the two truths is made\nbased on the ways in which a subject (yul can) apprehends an\nobject (yul). That is, the way in which one engages with the\nworld determines whether one perceives things conventionally or\nultimately. Broadly speaking, the conventional truth is mediated by\nconcepts, logic, and reasoning, while the ultimate truth is outside of\nthe realm of conceptual thought. As long as one is engaged in\nconcepts, one is interacting with conventional reality. Once all\nconcepts have been eliminated by following the Buddhist path (as will\nbe explained below), one is said to have realized the ultimate\nreality.\n\nGorampa defines \u201cconventional truth\u201d as that which appears\nto ordinary beings with ordinarily functioning sense faculties.\nObjects, words, smells, and ideas are all sorts of things that can be\nconventionally true, or conventionally real. They are true or real in\nthe sense that they appear to be true or real to ordinary persons,\nwithout any sort of philosophical analysis. Most people in Paris, for\nexample, can point to the Eiffel Tower and agree, \u201cThat is the\nEiffel Tower.\u201d The existence of the Eiffel Tower is thus\nconventionally true. It appears to ordinary people with fully\nfunctioning sense faculties, and these ordinary people identify it by\nmeans of the linguistic convention, \u201cEiffel Tower.\u201d\n\nIt is not, however, necessarily the case that anything that can be\nidentified or described in words is conventionally true. If a tourist\nin Paris drinks too much wine and starts seeing double, for example,\nthis does not mean that the existence of two Eiffel Towers is suddenly\nconventionally true. The drunk person\u2019s perception is skewed; he\nis no longer operating with ordinary faculties. After he sobers up, he\nwill once again see that really, there is only one Eiffel Tower. To\nillustrate this point in his texts, Gorampa refers to\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s well-known Madhyamaka analogy of a person\nwith an eye disorder (rab rib can) mistakenly thinking that the\nfloaters in his field of vision are actually hairs on his dinner\nplate. But the truth of the matter \u2013 the conventional truth,\nthat is \u2013 is that the hairs are not really there, as a person\nwith normally functioning eyes can affirm.\n\nThe conventional truth, therefore, is true in the sense that it is\nsomething upon which all ordinary persons with normally functioning\nfaculties can agree. The conventional truth is what allows for people\nto travel to Paris to visit the Eiffel Tower, to talk about the\nweather, and to engage in debates about politics. It is also, most\nimportantly for Gorampa, what allows people to understand conceptually\nwhat a realization of the ultimate truth is like, and what enables\nBuddhist practitioners to correctly develop logical reasoning and\nengage in proper types of meditative practices. In other words, some\nfeatures of the conventional \u2013 such as reasoning and\nlanguage \u2013 can be used to approach an understanding of the\nultimate, even though the ultimate itself transcends those\nfeatures.\n\nIn contrast to the conventional, the ultimate truth is understood as\nthe way things really are, independent of the concepts and conventions\nwith which ordinary persons engage. Gorampa contends that the\nconventional truth is mired in ignorance \u2013 the cause of\nsa\u1e43s\u0101ra, which keeps sentient beings cycling from\none birth to the next, lifetime after lifetime. When this ignorance is\nremoved, one is capable of realizing the ultimate truth, and through\nthat realization, one can attain freedom from the cycle of\nrebirth.\n\nBased on this account, then, when philosophers attempt to describe or\neven label \u201cthe ultimate truth,\u201d they fail to capture it\nin its entirety; when identifying and describing the ultimate truth,\nconcepts and language must be used, and Gorampa\u2019s definition of\nthe ultimate truth is that it is beyond all concepts and language.\nStill, Gorampa argues that it is important to begin the process of\nrealizing the actual ultimate truth by developing a conceptual\nunderstanding of the general features of the ultimate. In other words,\nforming a concept of the ultimate is not the final goal of awakening\nitself, but it gives one a sense of what awakening is like.\n\nIn order to explain the difference between a conceptual understanding\nand a nonconceptual realization of the ultimate truth, Gorampa divides\nit into two types: the ultimate that is taught (bstan pa'i don\ndam) and the ultimate that is realized (rtogs pa'i don\ndam). The ultimate that is taught corresponds to an ordinary\nperson\u2019s concept of the ultimate, while the ultimate that is\nrealized is directly and nonconceptually ascertained by awakened\nbeings.\n\nWhen the ultimate is divided in this way, Gorampa makes the case that\nordinary persons and awakened beings are capable of recognizing each\nof the two truths, but in different ways. An ordinary person can\nconceptually understand the ultimate that is taught, while still\nperceiving the conventional realm as true or real. From this\nperspective, the conventional is called \u201cthe conventional\ntruth\u201d (kun rdzob bden pa). But once an awakened\nbeing nonconceptually apprehends the ultimate that is realized, the\nconventional no longer appears as real or as solid as it once was. The\nawakened being, having had a direct experience of the way things\nreally are, no longer experiences the conventional as true, but\nrather as merely conventional (kun rdzob tsam).\n\nIn other words, we can say that the conventional truth is that\nwhich is true for ordinary, unawakened beings. The merely\nconventional, however, is perceived after an awakened being\nrealizes the ultimate truth. There merely conventional is not false;\nit is simply a mode of perception that is subordinated to the ultimate\ntruth that an awakened being has directly experienced.\n\nUnlike some other Tibetan philosophers, Gorampa stresses that the\ndifference between conventional truth and mere convention is based\nentirely on the subject who apprehends these objects. The same table\nappears as truly existent to an ordinary being, and as a merely\nconventional imputation to an awakened being. The conventional and\nultimate truths, similarly, are distinguished on the basis of the ways\nin which they are apprehended. (This approach differs from someone\nlike Tsongkhapa, who distinguishes the two truths on the basis of the\nobject, arguing that every appearing thing consists of conventional\nand ultimate aspects.)\n\nIn short, ordinary beings perceive the conventional truth, and\nunderstand the ultimate that is taught. Awakened beings\nexperience the merely conventional, and directly realize the\nultimate that is realized. Based on this model of the two\ntruths, Gorampa argues that the Buddhist path involves a process of\ntransforming one\u2019s perspective. One begins by correctly\nidentifying and understanding the conventional truth. Then, through\nlogical reasoning and meditative practices, one gradually begins to\nrealize that this so-called truth is merely conventional and that it\nis based entirely on concepts that are rooted in ignorance; in this\nway one comes to a conceptual understanding of the ultimate that is\ntaught. Through more analysis and practice still, one eventually\nrecognizes that the conventional truth is only merely conventional,\nand directly realizes the ultimate truth, which does not depend on\nignorance and concepts.\n\nBy working through this process to transform one\u2019s mind, Gorampa\nargues that a Buddhist practitioner on the Madhymaka path will finally\narrive at a state of freedom from conceptual proliferations (spros\npa dang bral ba). This is a mental state in which conceptual\nthought does not occur, and one directly and immediately apprehends\nthe ultimate that is realized. Gorampa is explicit in pointing out\nthat this state of freedom from conceptual proliferations is different\nfrom a state of unconsciousness. In order to cultivate a state of\nfreedom from conceptual proliferations, one must eliminate concepts\ngradually, through particular methods that involve both logical\nreasoning and meditative practices. As we will see below, Gorampa\noutlines a very specific fourfold process for eliminating concepts in\norder to arrive at this desired state of nonconceptuality.\n",
