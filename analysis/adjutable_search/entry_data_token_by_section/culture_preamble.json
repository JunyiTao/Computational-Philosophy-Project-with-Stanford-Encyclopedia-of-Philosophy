    "main_text": "\n\nDemocratic societies are often characterized by extensive pluralism of\nreligions, cultures, ethnicities, and worldviews, on the basis of\nwhich citizens make claims against their state. Democratic states are\nadditionally characterized by a commitment to treat all citizens\nequally, and so they require fair and just ways to wade through and\nrespond to these claims. This entry considers cultural claims in\nparticular.\n\nCultural claims are ubiquitous in political and legal spaces. Not only\ndo individuals and groups both make cultural claims against the state,\noften for legal or political accommodations, but the state often\nexplains its choices in terms of protecting particular aspects of its\nculture. This entry will first examine the ways in which\n\u201cculture\u201d is defined by political and moral philosophers:\nculture-as-encompassing group, culture-as-social-formation,\nculture-as-narrative/dialogue, and culture-as-identity. Over the\ncourse of this discussion, the \u201cessentialist\u201d challenge\nwill be introduced: an essentialist account of culture is one that\ntreats certain key characteristics of that culture as defining it and\ncorrespondingly all of its members must share certain key traits in\norder to be treated as members (for more, see Phillips 2010). In\nparticular, the entry goes on to note that early conceptions of\nculture-as-encompassing groups are criticized for being essentialist,\nand later conceptions are attempts to reformulate culture in ways that\navoid the essentialist challenge.\n\nFollowing an articulation of these main ways of understanding culture,\nthe entry turns to an assessment of distinct (though occasionally\noverlapping) types of cultural claims that are pressed against the\nstate by minority groups: exemption claims, assistance claims,\nself-determination claims, recognition claims, preservation claims\n(and claims against coerced cultural loss), defensive claims in legal\nsettings, and exclusive use claims (claims against cultural\nappropriation). There are both justifications for, and objections to,\nthese claims, and they often hinge on how \u201cculture\u201d is\nunderstood. In many cases, the disputes about the justifiability of\nthese claims hinge on competing understandings of what culture is, and\nespecially, how valuable it is to those who are members, as will be\nshown below. Finally, the entry will close with an assessment of cases\nwhere a majority community makes cultural claims to justify actions,\nmainly in the context of controlling immigration and, in some cases,\nrefusing entry to potential migrants all together, as well as the\ncultural demands it makes of those who are admitted, and the range of\njustifications and objections offered in these cases. This section\nconsiders the content of the majority culture, to which\nnewcomers are asked to adhere, as well as how forcibly they can be\n\u201casked\u201d to do so.\n",
