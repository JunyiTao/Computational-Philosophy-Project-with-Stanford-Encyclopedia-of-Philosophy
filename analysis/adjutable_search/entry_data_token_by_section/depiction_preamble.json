    "main_text": "\n\nDepiction or pictorial representation was studied less intensively by\nphilosophers than linguistic meaning until the 1960s. The traditional\ndoctrine that pictures represent objects by copying their appearance\nhad been challenged by art theorists since the first quarter of the\ntwentieth century, when what were thought of as illusionistic styles\nof painting lost favour, due to the growing prestige of so-called\n\u201cprimitive\u201d artistic styles, and the fauvist and cubist\nexperiments of artists at that time. But it took several decades\nbefore philosophers became interested in these debates. When they did\nso, it was largely due to the impact of two books: Ernst\nGombrich\u2019s Art and Illusion (1960), and Nelson\nGoodman\u2019s Languages of Art (1968). Gombrich explored a\nvariety of problems about the nature of depiction, the evolution of\nstyle, and the nature of realism, drawing extensively on theories of\nvisual perception advanced since Helmholtz, and on Karl Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationist theory of science. Goodman, by contrast defended a\npurely conventionalist theory of depiction in general and realistic\ndepiction in particular, which was rooted in the nominalist philosophy\nhe had developed in collaboration with W.V.O. Quine. A large part of\nthe philosophical work on this topic during the past fifty years\nconsists in attempts to develop theories of depiction in general, and\nrealistic depiction in particular, which overcome the objections to\ntheir views, while avoiding the simplifications and alleged cultural\nbias of the traditional ideas they rejected.\n",
