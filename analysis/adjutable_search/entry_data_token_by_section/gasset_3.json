Biological thoughts of Hans Driesch, August Weissmann, and\nJakob von Uexk\u00fcll, and the philosophical, economic and social\nthoughts of Max Scheler, Georg Simmel and Werner Sombart were\nintroduced to Spanish university students for the first time. In July\n1916, Ortega, his father and several other Spanish intellectuals\ndeparted Spain for Argentina where, between August and October, Ortega\ngave a series of lectures at the University of Buenos Aires on Kant\nand the currents in contemporary Continental philosophy. These\nlectures followed the recent arrival of Julio Rey Pastor, a noted\nSpanish mathematician, who immigrated to Argentina to elevate the\nmathematical and scientific level of instruction at the University of\nBuenos Aires. Ortega\u2019s residence in Buenos Aires kept him away from\npolitical affairs, save for an article in June 1917 in which he\ncriticized the role of the military in politics. The political\ncommentary precipitated his definitive departure from El\nImparcial and prompted his move with his brother, Eduardo, to\njoin a new daily newspaper El Sol, founded by a close friend,\nNicol\u00e1s Mar\u00eda de Urgoiti of La Papelera Espa\u00f1ola.\nThe first issue appeared on December 1, 1917. Five years later, Ortega\nalso assisted in establishing the publishing house Calpe (later named\nEspasa-Calpe), which immediately made available Spanish and European\nclassic and contemporary literature in reasonably priced paperback\neditions. Between these activities, Ortega became the founder and\ndirector of the monthly Revista de Occidente, publishing the\nfirst issue in July 1923. The Revista, which was directed\ntoward an educated readership, quickly became one of Europe\u2019s renowned\nintellectual journals. The organ became a veritable \u201cReview of\nthe West\u201d as several of the articles, which were translations of\nworks previously published abroad, were important philosophic and\nscientific trends representative of \u201cour epoch\u201d: Spengler,\nHuizinga, Simmel, Uexk\u00fcll, Brentano, Heimsoeth, Driesch,\nPf\u00e4nder, M\u00fcller and Russell. The journal also became the\nprincipal medium of the intelligentsia and, in conjunction with\nOrtega\u2019s tertulias in the offices on the Avenue Pi y Margall,\nassisted in fostering the poetic generation of young intellectuals,\nthe \u201cGeneration of 1927\u201d. The Generation of 1927\noriginated as a term to characterize a certain similarity of poets and\nwriters in 1920s Spain. The year signaled the moment when\nintellectuals and students began to resist the dictatorship of General\nMiguel Primo de Rivera as a prelude to the Second Republic. As with\ntheir predecessors, the Generation of 1898, the perceived national\ncrisis created a spirit of collective mentality, or at least a shared\nidentity, in the years preceding the Spanish Civil War. Several of the\nyounger vanguard poets were first published by \u00cdndice,\nfounded and directed by Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez\nMantec\u00f3n (1881\u20131958), a nineteenth-century follower of\nKarl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781\u20131832), who had been one of\nthe first to reintroduce modernist themes in Spanish literature. Other\nmembers of the Generation of 1927 found expression through the\nRevista de Occidente. Ortega, whose major works were\npublished in the 1920s, served as one of the most important links\nbetween the two generations by giving editorial assistance to the\nyounger poets and addressing The Dehumanization of Art (1925)\nto their concerns. Along with Am\u00e9rico Castro (1885\u20131972),\nRam\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala (1880\u20131962), and Eugenio\nd\u2019Ors y Rovira (1882\u20131954), he provided an intellectual\nleadership that inspired the younger Spaniards to develop fully their\nown creative endeavors.\n\nThese young artists and poets were marking their careers on the crest\nof a new wave that swept intellectual circles in Europe and Spain.\nPolitics appeared to pursue culture and art. As these young poets and\nartists matured and identified with the Generation of 1927, they\nbecame more daring and willing to experiment with new techniques and\nmedia to produce a much wider vivid impact. Federico Garc\u00eda\nLorca\u2019s (1898\u20131936) friendly collaboration with painter Salvador\nDal\u00ed (1904\u20131989), film director Luis Bu\u00f1uel\n(1900\u20131983) and composer Manuel de Falla (1876\u20131946)\ndemonstrated an appreciation for combining new techniques to extract\nmysterious essences from human experience. Their works offered vivid\nimages of the new abstract aesthetic mysticism and surrealism in the\n1920s. These new art forms and novel methods of perceiving hidden\nessences were immediately associated with the aesthetic expressions\nthat rejected old moralities and traditional values, developed a\ngreater interest in politics and represented an ever-increasing\ncreative sensitivity. Indeed, this new found freedom in aesthetic\nexpression was extended to the realm of politics. In April 1929, after\nOrtega resigned his chair of metaphysics at the Central University of\nMadrid in protest of Primo de Rivera\u2019s repressive educational\npolicies, several of these young intellectuals representing diverse\npolitical positions turned to him for political counsel and implored\nhim to guide their reform movement on behalf of a \u201cmodern\u201d\nand \u201cintellectual\u201d orientation toward\n\u201cfreedom\u201d in Spain. Ortega declined the leadership role\nproposed by Garc\u00eda Lorca and the group of young intellectuals\nand offered, instead, his \u201csympathy, support, and\ncomradeship\u201d.\n",
