    "main_text": "God and Creativity\n2. God and Creativity\n\nThe question of the metaphysical relation of God and creativity is a\nwatershed between process theism and more traditional forms of theism.\nProcess philosophy, modifying a statement from Plato\u2019s\nSophist (247e), affirms that the most concrete real\nbeings\u2014in Whitehead\u2019s language, actual entities\u2014are\ncharacterized by the power to act and to be acted upon (Plato\nsays real beings act or are acted upon). In process\nmetaphysics no actual entity is wholly determined by the activity of\nanother; or phrased positively, every actual entity retains\nsome power of self-determination, however minimal or slight\nit may be. According to this view, to have power in relation to others\nis to have power in relation to other entities with some degree of\npower. This is process philosophy\u2019s doctrine of universal\ncreativity. Hartshorne says, \u201cTo be is to create\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1970, 1, 272). The logic of the matter does not change if\nGod is included in the metaphysical scheme. For process theism, God is\nthe supreme or eminent creative power, but not the only creative\npower. Thus, process theists speak of God and the creatures as\nco-creators (Hartshorne and Reese 1953 [2000, 140]; Hartshorne 1967a,\n113).\n\nProcess theism\u2019s doctrine of creativity differs from that of\nclassical theism according to which God alone is genuinely creative.\nThomas Aquinas says that in the proper sense of the word, only God\ncreates (Summa Theologica I, Q 45, a. 5). Aquinas explains\nthat to create is to bring something from nothing, and this is\npossible only for deity. This is the famous doctrine of\ncreatio ex nihilo, or creation from no pre-existing\nmaterial. This ex nihilo creation is logically distinct from\nthe claim that the universe is temporally finite. Aquinas, for\nexample, treats the questions whether God is the creator and whether\nthe universe had a beginning under separate headings. Aquinas is clear\nthat he accepts the temporal finitude of the universe as a matter of\nfaith, from revelation, and not because of rational argument. On the\nother hand, like other traditional theists (Gottfried Leibniz for\nexample), Aquinas holds that God could have created a temporally\ninfinite universe, but it too would have been created ex\nnihilo.\n\nProcess theists generally, though not unanimously, deny that the\nuniverse had a first temporal moment. Those wishing to demonstrate the\ncompatibility between process theism and Jewish and Christian\nScripture commonly follow David Griffin\u2019s arguments that the\nBible neither requires nor implies an absolute beginning of the\nuniverse (Griffin 2001b, 109\u2013114). There is still the objection,\nhowever, that by conceiving both God and the creatures as creative,\nprocess theists seem to destroy one of the most meaningful contrasts\nbetween God and the world: God as creator and the world as created.\nIndeed, Whitehead says, \u201cIt is as true to say that God creates\nthe World, as that the World creates God\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 348]).\nOne must, however, separate Whitehead\u2019s poetic expression from\nhis philosophical meaning. In process theism, as in traditional\ntheism, the existence of God is in no way precarious, in no\nway dependent upon the activity of other entities; likewise, process\ntheism and traditional theism are in agreement that non-divine\nindividuals are contingent (they can fail to exist)\u2014in the case\nof non-angelic beings, they are born and they die. In\nWhitehead\u2019s and Hartshorne\u2019s form of theism, God\u2019s\nexistence is everlasting, but the existence of any particular creature\nis not. Nevertheless, the creatures, being lesser creators, create\nsomething in God, if only the knowledge of their own activity. For\nprocess theism, the activity of the creatures makes no difference to\nGod\u2019s existence, only to God\u2019s experience of them.\n\nImplicit in traditional theism\u2019s doctrine of creation are the\nideas that God\u2019s creative act and God\u2019s knowledge of the\nworld are non-temporal. Augustine, for example, in the\nConfessions (book XI, chapters 13 and 14), considers it\nnonsensical to ask what God was doing before the creation of the\nworld; God, in creating the universe, brings time\u2014and with it,\nrelations of before and after\u2014into existence; thus, it is no\nmore meaningful to ask what came before the first moment of\ntime than it is to ask on a spinning sphere what is north of the north\npole. In traditional theism, the temporal world is spread out before\nGod who can see it in its entirety from an eternal vantage point. As\nBoethius says in The Consolation of Philosophy (book 5, prose\n6), eternity is the complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of\neverlasting life. Process theism takes a contrary view that time\nis the process of creation. In other words, the order of beings\nin time is the process whereby beings are created. For process\nmetaphysics, there is no eternal act of divine creation that fixes the\nworld in existence and there is no eternal perspective from which the\nuniverse can be considered a finished product. Furthermore, the\n\u201ccreative advance,\u201d as Whitehead calls the universe, is\ninherently open-ended and growing, like a line to which tiny segments\nare continually being added. Where Aquinas could liken God\u2019s\nprescience to a man viewing a caravan of travelers from a high tower,\nHartshorne says, \u201cThere is not (either now or eternally) a fixed\ntotality of travelers for God to survey, but a new totality each\nmoment\u201d (Hartshorne 1970, 135).\n\nWhitehead remarks that, \u201cIn all philosophic theory there is an\nultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 7]). In process thought, this ultimate is creativity. It would be\nmisleading, however, to speak as though creativity were \u201cthe\nultimate reality\u201d according to process theism (Hick 1990, 49).\nCreativity is not a metaphysical agency that produces anything;\nrather, it is the character of every concrete fact, from the humblest\nflicker of existence in non-divine actual entities to God.\nWhitehead\u2019s pithy summary of process philosophy is, \u201cThe\nmany become one, and are increased by one\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]).\nCreativity, then, is the ultimate metaphysical principle. A principle,\nhowever, is not a real being. Whitehead explained to his student A. H.\nJohnson that God is not a principle but an actuality (Johnson 1983,\n5). That which is best described, in process theism, as the ultimate\nreality, is God. For Whitehead and Hartshorne, God should not be\ntreated as the exception to metaphysical principles; otherwise, apart\nfrom an appeal to putative revelations from God, there could be no\nreasoned discourse about the divine. Whitehead and Hartshorne strive\nto conceive God as the chief exemplification of metaphysical\nprinciples. In process theism, the divine or eminent form of\ncreativity provides the basis for cosmic order and achieved value. In\nWhitehead\u2019s words, God is \u201cthe poet of the world,\u201d\nleading it with tender patience by the divine vision of truth, beauty,\nand goodness (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 346]).\n\nProcess theism is critical of the traditional metaphysical question,\n\u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d In process\nthought, the proposition, \u201cSomething exists,\u201d is a\nnecessary truth (Hartshorne 1971). Insofar as traditional theism\nmaintains the doctrine of the necessary existence of God, it too\naccepts the necessity of something existing. Therefore, the difference\nbetween process theism and traditional theism is not in whether\nsomething necessarily exists, but in the nature of the\nnecessarily existent. According to traditional theism, the\ntotality of non-divine entities is a multiplicity in need of\ngrounding in a primordial unifying activity\u2014the \u201cpure\nact\u201d (actus purus) of existing that is God.\nProcess theism refuses to give a privileged metaphysical status to the\none over the many. In Whitehead\u2019s words, \u201cThe term\n\u2018many\u2019 presupposes the term \u2018one,\u2019 and the\nterm \u2018one\u2019 presupposes the term \u2018many\u2019\u201d\n(Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]). Taking creativity as the category of the\nultimate is an attempt to keep the one and the many on equal\nmetaphysical footing by taking reality itself as necessarily social.\nGod, considered as the ultimate reality in any version of process\nmetaphysics, necessarily exists as a social being in dynamic\ninteraction with all non-divine entities.\n\nClearly, treating creativity as the ultimate metaphysical principle\nhas far-reaching consequences for the concept of God and of\nGod\u2019s relations to others. It is not possible, in process\nmetaphysics, to conceive divine activity as a\n\u201csupernatural\u201d intervention into the \u201cnatural\u201d\norder of events. Process theists usually regard the distinction\nbetween the supernatural and the natural as a by-product of the\ndoctrine of creation ex nihilo. In process thought, there is\nno such thing as a realm of the natural in contrast to that which is\nsupernatural. On the other hand, if \u201cthe natural\u201d is\ndefined more neutrally as \u201cwhat is in the nature of\nthings,\u201d then process metaphysics characterizes the natural as\nthe creative activity of actual entities. In Whitehead\u2019s words,\n\u201cIt lies in the nature of things that the many enter into\ncomplex unity\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 21]). It is tempting to emphasize\nprocess theism\u2019s denial of the supernatural and thereby\nhighlight what the process God cannot do in comparison to what the\ntraditional God can do (that is, to bring something from nothing). In\nfairness, however, equal stress should be placed on process\ntheism\u2019s denial of the natural (as traditionally conceived) so\nthat one may highlight what the creatures cannot do, in traditional\ntheism, in comparison to what they can do in process metaphysics (that\nis, to be part creators of the world with God).\n",
