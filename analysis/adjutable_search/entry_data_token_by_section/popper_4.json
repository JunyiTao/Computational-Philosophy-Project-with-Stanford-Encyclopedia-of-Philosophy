    "main_text": "The Growth of Human Knowledge\n5. The Growth of Human Knowledge\n\nFor Popper, the growth of human knowledge proceeds from our problems\nand from our attempts to solve them. These attempts involve the\nformulation of theories which must go beyond existing knowledge and\ntherefore require a leap of the imagination. For this reason, he\nplaces special emphasis on the role played by the creative imagination\nin theory formulation. The priority of problems in\nPopper\u2019s account of science is paramount, and it is this which\nleads him to characterise scientists as \u201cproblem-solvers\u201d.\nFurther, since the scientist begins with problems rather than with\nobservations or \u201cbare facts\u201d, he argues that the only\nlogical technique which is an integral part of scientific method is\nthat of the deductive testing of theories which are not themselves the\nproduct of any logical operation. In this deductive procedure\nconclusions are inferred from a tentative hypothesis and are then\ncompared with one another and with other relevant statements to\ndetermine whether they falsify or corroborate the hypothesis. Such\nconclusions are not directly compared with the facts, Popper stresses,\nsimply because there are no \u201cpure\u201d facts available; all\nobservation-statements are theory-laden, and are as much a function of\npurely subjective factors (interests, expectations, wishes, etc.) as\nthey are a function of what is objectively real.\n\nHow then does the deductive procedure work? Popper specifies four\nsteps (2002: 9):\n\nThe first is formal, a testing of the internal\nconsistency of the theoretical system to see if it involves any\ncontradictions.\nThe second step is semi-formal, \u201cthe investigation\nof the logical form of the theory, with the object of determining\nwhether it has the character of an empirical or scientific theory, or\nwhether it is, for example, tautological\u201d (2002: 9).\nThe third step is the comparing of the new theory with existing\nones to determine whether it constitutes an advance upon them. If its\nexplanatory success matches that of the existing theories, and it\nadditionally explains some hitherto anomalous phenomenon or solves\nsome hitherto unsolvable problems, it will be adopted as constituting\nan advance upon the existing theories. In that sense, science involves\ntheoretical progress: on this account, a theory X is better\nthan a \u201crival\u201d theory Y if X has\ngreater empirical content, and hence greater predictive\npower, than Y.\nThe fourth and final step is the testing of a theory by the\nempirical application of the conclusions derived from it. If such\nconclusions are shown to be true, the theory is corroborated (but\nnever verified). If the conclusion is shown to be false, then this is\ntaken as a signal that the theory cannot be completely correct\n(logically the theory is falsified), and the scientist begins his\nquest for a better theory. He does not, however, abandon the\npresent theory until such time as he has a better one to substitute\nfor it.\n\n\nThe general picture of Popper\u2019s philosophy of science, then is\nthis: Hume\u2019s philosophy demonstrates that there is a\ncontradiction implicit in traditional empiricism, which holds that\nuniversal scientific laws are in some way finally confirmable by\nexperience, despite the open-ended nature of the latter being\nacknowledged. Popper eliminates the contradiction by removing the\ndemand for empirical verification in favour of empirical falsification\nor corroboration. Scientific theories, for him, are not inductively\ninferred from experience, nor is scientific experimentation carried\nout with a view to verifying or finally establishing the truth of\ntheories; rather, all knowledge is provisional, conjectural,\nhypothetical\u2014the universal theories of science can never be\nconclusively established. Hence Popper\u2019s emphasis on the\nimportance of the critical spirit to science\u2014for him critical\nthinking is the very essence of rationality. For it is only by\ncritical thought that we can eliminate false theories and determine\nwhich of the remaining theories is the best available one, in the\nsense of possessing the highest level of explanatory force and\npredictive power.\n",
