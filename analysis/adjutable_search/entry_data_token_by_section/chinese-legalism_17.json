    "main_text": "Assault on Culture and Learning\n7. Epilogue: The fa Tradition in Chinese History and in Modern Research\n\nThe fa tradition experienced odd destiny in imperial China.\nOn the one hand, many of its tenets\u2014e.g., the usage of objective\nand quantifiable standards in assessing the officials\u2019\nperformance\u2014were duly utilized by the empire\u2019s leaders\n(cf. Korolkov forthcoming and Creel 1974: 233\u2013293). On the other\nhand, some of the fa thinkers\u2019 basic recommendations\nproved untenable for the unified empire. For instance, the\ndiscontinuation of universal military service in the Han dynasty\n(Lewis 2000) caused gradual atrophy of the system of ranks of merit\nadvocated by Shang Yang, turning the crux of his social engineering\nprogram irrelevant to the imperial-era statesmen (Pines 2016b:\n29\u201331). Even more consequentially, the emergence of powerful\nlocal elites early in the Han dynasty eroded another pillar of\nfa thought, viz. the insistence on the state as the sole\nprovider of material and social benefits. As the political and\nintellectual power of these elites increased, more and more ideas of\nthe fa thinkers were sidelined. Such prominent tenets of\nfa thought as evolutionary view of history, the dismissive\nattitude toward self-cultivation, the derision of moralizing\ndiscourse, the denigration of independent intellectuals and the like,\nhad largely disappeared from the imperial-era political texts.\n\nWhen the Imperial Counsellor Sang Hongyang \u6851\u5f18\u7f8a\n(152\u201380 BCE) defended Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, and Han Fei during\nthe Salt and Iron Debates of 81 BCE, this was the last major occasion\nin imperial China\u2019s history that a leading statesman had openly\nidentified himself with these thinkers and proudly positioned himself\nas their heir (Yantielun, chapters 7 and 56; see also\nPolnarov 2018). Thenceforth, manifold supporters of \u201ca rich\nstate and a strong army\u201d policy would usually distance\nthemselves from Shang Yang or Han Fei, even if admiring their deeds.\nThe image of the fa thinkers was too tarnished to merit open\nidentification. These thinkers, were viewed, following Sima Tan, as\n\u201cstrict and having little kindness\u201d (Shiji 130:\n3289), as advocates of cruel laws and merciless punishments, as\nproponents of the policies that were diametrically opposite to the\ncherished \u201ceducational transformation\u201d (jiaohua\n\u6559\u5316). One of the imperial China\u2019s most brilliant\nintellectuals, Su Shi \u8607\u8efe (appellative Dongpo\n\u6771\u5761, 1036\u20131101) remarked, derisively: \u201cfrom\nthe Han onward, scholars have been ashamed to speak about Shang Yang\nand Sang Hongyang\u201d (Dongpo quanji 105:14).This verdict\ngrasps well the dominant attitude toward the fa tradition in\nimperial China. It was only on the eve of the collapse of the Qing\ndynasty and of the imperial order itself, when, amid massive\nreevaluation of the past, scholars starting paying attention to this\nlong-sidelined tradition (Song, forthcoming B).\n\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, we witness a robust\ninterest in the fa texts, which attracted scholars because\ntheir ideas resonated with aspects of modern Western thought, be it\nthe evolutionary view of history or the idea of fazhi, viewed\nby many as compatible withthe Western \u201crule of law.\u201d Yet\nthe twentieth-century rediscovery remained somewhat abortive due to\nthe lingering political dislike of the authoritarian aspects of the\nfa tradition, as well as due to mere scholarly inertia. Even\nthe odd outburst of adoration of fa ideology during the\nMaoist campaign \u201cReappraise the fa thinkers, criticize\nConfucians\u201d \u8a55\u6cd5\u6279\u5112 (1973\u20131975 )\ndid not result in major breakthroughs (Li Yu-ning 1977; Chen 2019).\nOnce the campaign ended, the interest in the fa tradition in\nmainland China receded anew, whereas elsewhere the bizarre endorsement\nof fa thinkers by Maoist radicals had actually discouraged\nin-depth engagement with their texts (Pines, forthcoming C).\n\nThis legacy of lackluster interest in fa thought is most\nreadily recognizable in studies of \u201cChinese philosophy\u201d in\nthe West. Even a brief survey of major Western introductory-level\nstudies of Chinese philosophy through the twentieth century and into\nthe first decade of the twenty-first suffices to demonstrate the\nongoing sidelining of the fa tradition. In these studies, the\nfa texts usually merit just between five to ten percent of\ntotal space dedicated to China\u2019s preimperial thinkers. Besides,\nuntil the second decade of the twenty-first century, the fa\nthinkers merited little if any attention in major Anglophone scholarly\njournals that deal with Chinese philosophy, such as Dao,\nThe Journal of Chinese Philosophy, and Philosophy East\nand West.\n\nSince the second decade of the twenty-first century one can note a\nclear change. This decade witnessed a translation cum study of the\nShenzi Fragments (Harris 2016); two translations cum study of\nthe Book of Lord Shang (Vogelsang 2017; Pines 2017);\npublication of the Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei\n(Goldin 2013); and publication of more relevant articles than during\nthe previous half a century. This trend seems to accelerate further\n(see, e.g. Jiang 2021; Pines, forthcoming A). The increasing interest\nin the fa tradition is paralleled in China, where the topic\nhad been largely de-politicized (as for 2022), and where a scholarly\nsociety for studies of fajia was formed in 2015. Overall,\nthese new developments are conducive for in-depth engagement with the\nfa tradition.\n",
