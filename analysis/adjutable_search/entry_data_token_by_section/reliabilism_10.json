    "main_text": "New Developments for Reliabilism || Beyond Individualistic Reliabilism\n3.2 Beyond Individualistic Reliabilism\n\nMost versions of reliabilism are \u201cindividualistic\u201d in at\nleast two senses. First, they assume that the justificatory status of\nan agent\u2019s belief depends entirely on the reliability of\nprocesses that take place within that agent\u2019s head. Second, they\nassume that the bearers of justificatory status are the beliefs of\nindividual agents, rather than groups. Recently, several philosophers\nhave developed versions of reliabilism that revise or abandon these\nindividualistic assumptions.\n\nSanford Goldberg (2010) advances a distinctive view of testimonial\nbelief that abandons the first individualistic assumption. Goldberg\ninvites us to imagine that an informant (A) forms a perceptual\nbelief that p, which they convey via testimony to an audience\n(B), who then comes to believe p. However,\nA\u2019s perceptual belief that p was formed in a way\nthat falls just shy of the threshold for justification. Goldberg\ncontends that B\u2019s testimony-based belief that p\ndoes not amount to knowledge. What\u2019s more, the reason why it\ndoes not amount to knowledge is that it is not justified. After all,\nthe belief could well be true, and free from Gettierization. But if\nB\u2019s belief that p is not justified, this\njustificatory failing is not due to any unreliability in\nB\u2019s mental processing of A\u2019s testimony.\nRather, it\u2019s due to the fact that A\u2019s original\nbelief that p was insufficiently justified. Goldberg concludes\nthat the justificatory status of testimonial beliefs depends\u2014in\npart\u2014on the reliability of the testifier\u2019s cognitive\nprocesses.\n\nTurn next to the second individualistic assumption: the bearers of\njustificatory status are always the beliefs of individual agents. A\nnew movement in social epistemology has called this assumption into\nquestion. This movement starts with the observation that we routinely\nascribe beliefs to groups. For example, we talk about whether the jury\nbelieves the defendant is guilty, or what the Committee on Climate\nChange believes to be the causes of global warming. A burgeoning body\nof literature investigates the nature of group belief, and the ways in\nwhich group belief depends on the beliefs of the group\u2019s\nmembers. For important work on this topic, see Gilbert (1989); List\nand Pettit (2011); for an overview, see the entry on\n belief merging and judgment aggregation.\n\nIn addition to inquiring into the conditions under which a group holds\na particular belief, we can also inquire into the conditions under\nwhich group beliefs are justified. Some social\nepistemologists have sought to answer this question in reliabilist\nterms. For example, Goldman (2014) develops a view of group\njustification that is modelled on the way inference transmits\njustification within an individual agent. According to process\nreliabilism for individuals, inferential justification depends on two\nfactors: (a) the justifiedness of the premise beliefs and (b) the\nconditional reliability of the inferential process used.\nSimilarly, Goldman suggests, group justification depends on two\nanalogous factors: (a) the justifiedness of the members\u2019 beliefs\nand (b) the conditional reliability of the belief aggregation function\n(a function that specifies the way in which the group\u2019s beliefs\ndepend on the members\u2019 beliefs). The details of Goldman\u2019s\nproposal have been critically discussed by both Lackey (2016) and Dunn\n(forthcoming), both of whom propose alternative accounts of the\nconditions under which group beliefs are justified.\n",
