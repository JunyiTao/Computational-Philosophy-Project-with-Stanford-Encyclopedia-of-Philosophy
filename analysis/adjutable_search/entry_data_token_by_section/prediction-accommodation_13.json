Anti-Predictivism\n\nIt was noted in\n Section 1\n that John Maynard Keynes rejected predictivism\u2014he argued that\nwhen a theory T is first constructed it is usually the case\nthat there are reasons R that favor T. If T goes\non to generate successful novel predictions E then those\nreasons combine with R to support T\u2014but if some\n\\(T'\\) is constructed \u2018merely because it fit E\u2019\nthen \\(T'\\) will be less supported than T. This has been deemed\nthe \u201cKeynesian dissolution of the paradox of predictivism\u201d\n(Barnes 2008: 15\u201318) \n\nColin Howson cites with approval the Keynesian dissolution (1988: 382)\nand provides the following illustration: consider h and \\(h'\\)\nwhich are rival explanatory frameworks. \\(h'\\) independently predicts\ne; h does not entail e but has a free parameter\nwhich is fixed on the basis of e to produce\n\\(h(a_{0})\\)\u2014this latter hypothesis thus entails e. So\n\\(h'\\) predicts e while \\(h(a_{0})\\) merely accommodates\ne. Let us assume that the prior probabilities of h and\n\\(h'\\) are equal (i.e., \\(p(h) = p(h')\\)). Now it stands to reason\nthat \\(p(h(a_0)) \\lt p(h)\\) since \\(h(a_{0})\\) entails h but\nnot vice versa\u2014thus Howson shows it follows that the effect of\ne\u2019s confirmation will be to leave \\(h'\\) no less\nprobable\u2014and quite possibly more probable\u2014than\n\\(h(a_{0})\\) (1990: 236\u20137). Thus predictivism appears true but\nthe operating factor is the role of unequal prior\n probabilities.[14]\n\n\nThe argument from Keynes and Howson against predictivism holds that\nthe evidence which appears to support predictivism is\nillusory\u2014they are clearly asserting that strong predictivism is\nfalse, presumably in its temporal and heuristic forms.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the arguments of Keynes and\nHowson cited above predate the injection of the concept of \u2018weak\npredictivism\u2019 into the\n literature.[15]\n It is thus unclear what stand Keynes or Howson would take on weak\npredictivism. Likewise, Collins\u2019 1994 paper \u201cAgainst the\nEpistemic Value of Prediction\u201d strongly rejects predictivism,\nbut what he is clearly denying is what has since been deemed strong\nheuristic predictivism. He might endorse weak heuristic predictivism\nas he concedes that \n\n\nall sides to the debate agree that knowing that a theory predicted,\ninstead of accommodated, a set of data can give us an additional\nreason for believing it is true by telling us something about the\nstructural/relational features of a theory. (1994: 213) \n\n\nSimilarly Harker argues that \u201cit is time to leave predictivism\nbehind\u201d but also concedes that \u201csome weak predictivist\ntheses may be correct\u201d (2008: 451); Harker worries that\nproclaiming weak predictivism may mislead some into thinking that\npredictive success is somehow more important than other epistemic\nindicators (such as endorsement by reliable scientists). White goes so\nfar as to claim that weak predictivism \u201cis not\ncontroversial\u201d (2003: 656).\n\nStephen Brush is the author of a body of historical work much of which\npurports to show that temporal predictivism does not hold in various\nepisodes of the history of\n science.[16]\n These include the case of starlight bending in the assessment of the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity (Brush 1989), Alfv\u00e9n\u2019s\ntheories of space plasma phenomena (Brush 1990), and the revival of\nbig bang cosmology (Brush 1993). However, Brush (1996) argues that\ntemporal novelty did play a role in the acceptance of\nMendeleev\u2019s Periodic Table based on Mendeleev\u2019s\npredictions. Scerri and Worrall (2001) presents considerable\nhistorical detail about the assessment of Mendeleev\u2019s theory and\ndispute Brush\u2019s claim that temporal novelty played an important\nrole in the acceptance of the theory (2001: 428\u2013436). (See also\nBrush 2007.) Steele and Werndl (2013) argue that predictivism fails to\nhold in assessing models of climate change, while Frish (2015) affirms\nthat it displays weak predictivism. \n\nAnother form of anti-predictivism holds that accommodations are\nsuperior to predictions in theory confirmation. \u201cThe information that\nthe data was accommodated rather than predicted suggests that the data\nis less likely to have been manipulated or fabricated, which in turn\nincreases the likelihood that the hypothesis is correct in light of\nthe data\u201d (Dellsen forthcoming).\n8 The Realist/Anti-Realist Debate\n\nScientific realism holds that there is sufficient evidence to believe\nthat the theories of the \u2018mature sciences\u2019 are at least\napproximately true. Appeals to novelty have been important in\nformulating two arguments for realism\u2014these are the \u2018no\nmiracle argument\u2019 and the realist reply to the so-called\n\u2018pessimistic\n induction\u2019.[17]\n\n\nThe no-miracle argument for scientific realism holds that realism is\nthe only account that does not make the success of science a miracle\n(Putnam 1975: 73). \u2018The success of science\u2019 here refers to\nthe myriad verified empirical consequences of the theories of the\nmature sciences\u2014but as we have seen there is a long standing\ntendency to regard with suspicion those verified empirical\nconsequences the theory was built to fit. Thus the \u2018ultimate\nargument for scientific realism\u2019 refers to a version of the no\nmiracle argument that focuses just on the verified novel consequences\nof theories\u2014it would be a miracle, this argument proclaims, if a\ntheory managed to have a sustained record of successful novel\npredictions if the theory were not at least approximately true. Thus,\nassuming there are no competing theories with comparable records of\nnovel success, we ought to infer that such theories are at least\napproximately true (Musgrave\n 1988).[18]\n\n\nInsofar as the ultimate argument for realism clearly emphasizes a\nspecial role for novel successes, the nature of novelty has been an\nimportant focus in the realist account. Leplin 1997 is a book length\narticulation of the ultimate argument for realism; Leplin proposes a\nsufficient condition for novelty consisting of two conditions:\n\n\nAn observational result O is novel for T if: \n\nIndependence Condition: There is a minimally adequate\nreconstruction of the reasoning leading to T that does not cite\nany qualitative generalization of O.\nUniqueness Condition: There is some qualitative generalization of\nO that T explains and predicts, and of which, at the\ntime that T first does so, no alternative theory provides a\nviable reason to expect instances. (Leplin 1997: 77). \n\n\n\nLeplin clarifies that a \u2018minimally adequate\nreconstruction\u2019 of such reasoning will be a valid deduction\nD of the \u2018basic identifying hypotheses\u2019 of T\nfrom independently warranted background assumptions\u2014the premises\nof D cannot be weakened or simplified while preserving\nD\u2019s validity. Thus for Leplin what establishes whether\nO is a novel consequence of T is not whether O\nwas actually used in the construction of T, but rather whether\nit was \u2018needed\u2019 for T\u2019s construction. As with\nWorrall\u2019s mature \u2018essential use\u2019 conception of\nnovelty, what matters is whether there is a heuristic path to T\nthat does not appeal to O, whether or not O was used in\nconstructing T. The Uniqueness Condition helps bolster the\nargument for the truth of theories with true novel consequences, for\nif there were another theory \\(T'\\) (incompatible with T) that\nalso provides a viable explanation of O, the imputation of\ntruth could not explain the novel success of both T and \\(T'\\).\nThe success of at least one would have to be due to chance, but if\nchance could explain one such success it could explain the other as\nwell. \n\nBoth of these conditions for novelty have been questioned. Given the\nIndependence Condition, it is unclear that any observational result\nO will count as novel for any theory, for it may always be true\nthat the logically weakest set of premises that entail T (which\nwill be cited in a minimally adequate reconstruction of the reasoning\nthat led to T) will include O as a disjunct of one of\nthe premises (Healey 2001: 779). The Uniqueness Condition insists that\nthere be no available alternative explanation of O at the time\nT first explains O\u2014but clearly, theories that\nexplain O could be subsequently proposed and would threaten the\nimputation of truth to T no less. This condition seems\narbitrarily to privilege theories depending on when they were proposed\n(Sarkar 1998: 206\u20138; Ladyman 1999: 184). \n\nAnother conception of novelty whose purpose is to bolster the ultimate\nargument for realism is \u2018functional novelty\u2019 (Alai 2014).\nA datum d is \u2018functionally novel\u2019 for theory\nT if (1) d was not used essentially in constructing\nT (viz., there is a heuristic path to T and related\nauxiliary hypotheses that does not cite d), (2) d is\na priori improbable, and (3) d is heterogeneous with\nrespect to data that is used in constructing T and related\nauxiliary hypotheses (i.e. d is qualitatively different from\nsuch data). Functional novelty is a \u2018gradual\u2019 concept\ninsofar as a priori improbability and data heterogeneity come\nin degrees. If there is more than one theory for which d is\nfunctionally novel then the dispute between these theories cannot be\nsettled by the ultimate argument (Alai 2014: 306). \n\nAnti-realists have argued that insofar as we adopt a naturalistic\nphilosophy of science, the same standards should be used for assessing\nphilosophical theories as scientific theories. Consequently, if novel\nconfirmations are necessary for inferring a theory\u2019s truth then\nscientific realism should not be accepted as true, as the latter\nthesis has no novel confirmations to its credit (Frost-Arnold 2010,\nMizrahi 2012). \n\nAnother component of the realist/anti-realist debate in which appeals\nto novel success figure importantly is the debate over the\n\u2018pessimistic induction\u2019 (or \u2018pessimistic\nmeta-induction\u2019). According to this argument, the history of\nscience is almost entirely a history of theories that were judged\nempirically successful in their day only to be shown subsequently to\nbe entirely false. There is no reason to think that currently accepted\ntheories are any different in this regard (Laudan 1981b). \n\nIn response some realists have defended \u2018selective\nrealism\u2019 which concedes that while the majority of theories from\nthe history of science have proven false, some of them have components\nthat were retained in subsequent theories\u2014these tend to be the\ncomponents that were responsible for novel successes. Putative\nexamples of this phenomenon are the caloric theory of heat and\nnineteenth century optical theories (Psillos 1999: Ch. 6), both of\nwhich were ultimately rejected as false but which had components that\nwere retained in subsequent theories; these were the portions that\nwere responsible for their novel\n confirmations.[19]\n So in line with the ultimate argument the claim is made that novel\nsuccesses constitute a serious argument for the truth of the theory\ncomponent which generates them. However, antirealists have responded\nby citing cases of theoretical claims that were subsequently\ndetermined to be entirely false but which managed nonetheless to\ngenerate impressive records of novel predictions. These include\ncertain key claims made by Johannes Kepler in his Mysterium\nCosmographicum (1596), assumptions used by Adams and Leverrier in\nthe prediction of the planet Neptune\u2019s existence and location\n(Lyons 2006), and Ptolemaic astronomy (Carman & D\u00edez 2015).\nLeconte (2017) maintains that predictive success legitimates only\nsceptical realism \u2013 the claim that some part of a theory is true, but\nit is not known which part. \n",
