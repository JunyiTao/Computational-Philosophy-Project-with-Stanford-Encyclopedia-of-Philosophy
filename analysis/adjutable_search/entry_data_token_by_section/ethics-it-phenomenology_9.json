    "main_text": "Ethics and Information Technology || The Impact of Information Technology and the Application of Ethical Theory\n3.1 The Impact of Information Technology and the Application of Ethical Theory\n\nMuch of the ethical debate about computers and information technology\nmore generally has been informed by the tool and impact view of\ninformation technology (discussed in\n section 1.1\n above). Within this tradition a number of issues have emerged as\nimportant. For example, whether computers (or information and\ncommunication technology more generally) generate new types of ethical\nproblems that require new or different ethical theories or whether it\nis just more of the same (Gorniak 1996). These debates are often\nexpressed in the language of the impact of information\ntechnology on particular values and rights (Johnson 1985, 1994). Thus,\nwithin this approach we have discussions about the impact of CCTV or\nweb cookies on the right to privacy, the impact of the digital divide\non the right to access information, the impact of the piracy of\nsoftware on property rights, and so forth. In these debates Jim Moor\n(1985) has argued that computers show up policy vacuums that require\nnew thinking and the establishment of new policies. Others have argued\nthat the resources provided by classical ethical theory such as\nutilitarianism, consequentialism and deontological ethics is more than\nenough to deal with all the ethical issues emerging from our design\nand use of information technology (Gert 1999). \n\nIrrespective of whether information technology creates new types of\nethical problems that require new ethical theory or whether\nestablished ethical theory is sufficient, one tends to find the debate\ncentered on questions of policy that is intended to regulate or\njustify conduct vis-\u00e0-vis the negative impact produced by\ncertain uses or implementations of IT. These policies are seen, and\npresented as ways to regulate or balance competing rights or competing\nvalues in the context of the impact of IT. For example, what sort of\npolicies do we need to protect our children when they go on the\nInternet? How would these policies affect the right to free speech?\nOr, what sort of policies do we need to secure the rights of producers\nof digital products? How would these policies affect the right of\nsociety to a reasonable access to these products? (Lipinski &\nBritz 200). Furthermore, these debates are most often directed at an\ninstitutional level of discourse\u2014i.e., with the intention to\njustify the policies or conduct for governments, organizations and\nindividuals. In these debates on the impact of technology, ethicists\nare primarily conceived as presenting arguments for justifying a\nparticular balance, of values or rights, over and against other\npossibilities within the context of specific uses or implementations\nof IT. In presenting these arguments ethicists normally apply ethical\ntheories (such as consequentialism, utilitarianism, deontological\nethics, etc.) to new cases or problems presented by the use, or\nperceived impact, of the particular technology.\n",
