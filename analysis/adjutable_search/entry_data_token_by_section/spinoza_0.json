    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nBento (in Hebrew, Baruch; in Latin, Benedictus: all three names mean\n\u201cblessed\u201d) Spinoza was born in 1632 in Amsterdam. He was\nthe middle son in a prominent family of moderate means in\nAmsterdam\u2019s Portuguese-Jewish community. As a boy he had\nundoubtedly been one of the star pupils in the congregation\u2019s\nTalmud Torah school. He was intellectually gifted, and this could not\nhave gone unremarked by the congregation\u2019s rabbis. It is\npossible that Spinoza, as he made progress through his studies, was\nbeing groomed for a career as a rabbi. But he never made it into the\nupper levels of the curriculum, those which included advanced study of\nTalmud. At the age of seventeen, he was forced to cut short his formal\nstudies to help run the family\u2019s importing business.\n\nAnd then, on July 27, 1656, Spinoza was issued the harshest writ of\nherem, ban or excommunication, ever pronounced by the\nSephardic community of Amsterdam; it was never rescinded. We do not\nknow for certain what Spinoza\u2019s \u201cmonstrous deeds\u201d\nand \u201cabominable heresies\u201d were alleged to have been, but\nan educated guess comes quite easy. No doubt he was giving utterance\nto just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical\ntreatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul;\nstrongly rejects the notion of a transcendent, providential\nGod\u2014the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law\n(i.e., the commandments of the Torah and rabbinic legal principles)\nwas neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can\nthere be any mystery as to why one of history\u2019s boldest and most\nradical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?\n\nTo all appearances, Spinoza was content finally to have an excuse for\ndeparting from the community and leaving Judaism behind; his faith and\nreligious commitment were, by this point, gone. Within a few years, he\nleft Amsterdam altogether. By the time his extant correspondence\nbegins, in 1661, he is living in Rijnsburg, not far from Leiden. While\nin Rijnsburg, he worked on the Treatise on the Emendation of the\nIntellect, an essay on philosophical method, and the Short\nTreatise on God, Man and His Well-Being, an initial but aborted\neffort to lay out his metaphysical, epistemological and moral views.\nHis critical exposition of Descartes\u2019s Principles of\nPhilosophy, the only work he published under his own name in his\nlifetime, was completed in 1663, after he had moved to Voorburg,\noutside The Hague. By this time, he was also working on what would\neventually be called the Ethics, his philosophical\nmasterpiece. However, when he saw the principles of toleration in\nHolland being threatened by reactionary forces, including political\nmeddling by the Dutch Reformed Church, he put it aside to complete his\n\u201cscandalous\u201d Theological-Political Treatise,\npublished anonymously and to great alarm in 1670 (one overwrought\ncritic called it \u201ca book forged in hell by the devil\nhimself\u201d). When Spinoza died in 1677, in The Hague, he was still\nat work on his Political Treatise; this was soon published by\nhis friends along with his other unpublished writings, including a\nCompendium of Hebrew Grammar.\n",
