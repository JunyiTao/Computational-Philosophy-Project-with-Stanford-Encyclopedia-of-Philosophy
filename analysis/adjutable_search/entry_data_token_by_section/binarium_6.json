    "main_text": "Conceptual issues\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThe issues here are complex and the historical facts are not yet\nwell sorted out. But it appears that twentieth-century scholars who saw\na close conceptual link between universal hylomorphism and the\nplurality of forms were perhaps thinking of the two theories as\nmotivated by a common commitment to the first theory of predication\ndescribed in \u00a7 4 above. In some cases (for example the Fons vitae),\nthey probably were so motivated. Still, the fact that the two theories\nare regarded as a \u201cpair\u201d is a recent phenomenon, not a medieval\none. It seems to have arisen first in the writings of Daniel Callus.[28]\n",
