    "main_text": "Contemporary Controversies || Substance and teleology\n4. Conclusion\n\nAll non-relativist philosophical systems acknowledge substances in the\nmost generic sense of that term, for that is only to acknowledge that\nthere are some fundamental entities in their system. Most, if not all,\nphilosophers acknowledge that we cannot function without using\nsubstance concepts in the narrower sense, for the notion of an\nenduring particular or individual substance is essential to our making\nsense of the world as we live in it. But three things at least remain\ncontroversial. First, it is disputed what kinds of concepts need to be\ndeployed to characterise these enduring things: are they the rich\nvariety of traditional or \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 substance\nconcepts, or will various ways of identifying things simply as\nphysical bodies with certain characteristics do the job? Second, it is\nstill unclear how far our substance concepts purport to reflect a\ncomponent in reality (real or imagined) over and above the bundle of\nproperties that constitute its intelligible aspects. Third, the\nunclarity of the connection between what a thing is and\nwhat it does leaves unresolved the degree of interdependence\nbetween substance concepts and notions of purpose and final\ncausation.\n",
