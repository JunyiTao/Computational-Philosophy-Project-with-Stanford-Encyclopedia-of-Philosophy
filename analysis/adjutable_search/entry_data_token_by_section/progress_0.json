    "main_text": "Overview of Conceptual Issues\n1. Overview of Conceptual Issues \n\nThe problem of progress can be approached from many directions.  Three\nquestions will provide the starting points for this particular\nanalysis.  These are: (1) Does the theory under consideration\nrigorously define a conception of human well-being and, if so, what is\nit?  (2) What causes of long-term improvement and, especially, what\nlaws of historical development does the theorist propose? (3) What\nevidence or reasons does the theorist provide for the aforementioned\ncausal account? Note that the first question is normative, the second\nbelongs to social science, and the third is methodological and\nepistemological.\n\n\nTo argue successfully that human well-being is increasing over the long term, \ntheorists of progress must offer an interpretation of well-being compatible\nwith that claim. They are committed either to interpret human well-being as a \nsingle value, or as a set of incommensurable values that are empirically connected. \nIn the first case, value monism, the list of compelling alternatives is not long. \nIt includes freedom, happiness or utility, and the realization of human \ncapabilities.  In the second case, theorists can draw on a wider range of values, \nbut will have to show that the incommensurable components of human\nwell-being reinforce each other causally or at least do not clash.  As\nwe will see, faced with the difficulties of the task, some theorists\ndo not define well-being rigorously.  They may, however, formulate a\nconception of improvement for a circumscribed domain of social life,\nthe description of which is a part of their overall account.\n\n\nNext, each theorist of progress offers a causal story to explain the\nimprovement in the human condition that he thinks has occurred.  The\nnotion of a universal history, a historical narrative taking all of\nhumanity as its subject, came to prominence during the Enlightenment.\nUniversal historians aspired to surpass ordinary historians in breadth\nand depth and aimed to penetrate the surface play of events to\ndiscover fundamental laws of historical development.  These laws would\nnot only explain the past, but could be used to predict the future.\nAlthough a universal history need not be an account of improvement,\nall accounts of progress rest explicitly or implicitly on a universal\nhistory.\n\n\nThe content of the laws of progress, however, is an object of\ncontention. Many thinkers, including Hegel and Auguste Comte, view the\ndevelopment of ideas over time as the fundamental change that causes\noverall improvement.  Marx, in contrast, regards the growth of the\nmeans of production as primary.  Kant represents a third category,\narguing that a tension within human nature itself is the source of\nchange.  We will also see theorists who offer more eclectic causal\nstories and, because their accounts of change are more complicated,\nare less inclined to formalize their conclusions.  Next to content,\nthinkers differ in their treatment of episodes of devastation and\nconflict and periods of decline.  It is hard for anyone to sustain the\nargument that improvement is perfectly linear, but some theorists more\nthan others emphasize that such episodes and eras can be part of a\npattern of long-term improvement.  Furthermore, the extent to which\nthe laws are deterministic varies.  Some authors leave little room for\nchoice and contingency, while others frame their generalizations as\nloose trends that constrain rather than determine the course of\nevents.  Authors in the latter category often present their writings\nas political interventions that can shape the future as well as\npredict it.\n\n\nFinally, the question of method arises.  Most of the authors treated\nin this study wrote before quantitative and statistical methods in the\nsocial sciences became widespread.  Nevertheless, they do remark on\nmethod, in some cases in detail.  The most striking distinction is\nbetween those who rely on a priori reasoning and those who\ngeneralize from empirical facts in a social scientific fashion.  While\nthis study will not concentrate on method, a priori reasoning\nand problematic empirical assumptions will be attended to.\n\n",
