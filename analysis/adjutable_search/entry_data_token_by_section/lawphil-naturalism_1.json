    "main_text": "Replacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis\n2. Replacement Naturalism I: Against Conceptual Analysis\n\nReplacement Naturalism holds that conceptual and justificatory\ntheories\u2014the traditional fare of philosophy\u2014are to be\nreplaced by empirical and descriptive theories. There are two\nkinds of argumentative routes to Replacement Naturalism, both\ntraceable to Quine: the first arises from doubts about the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction (Quine 1951); the second from doubts\nabout foundationalism (Quine 1969). Here we consider the former.\n\nPhilosophers have long thought that some truths were\nnecessary while others were contingent; in the\ntwentieth century, under the influence of logical positivism, this was\ntaken to be the distinction between those statements that were\n\u201ctrue in virtue of meaning\u201d (hence necessarily\ntrue) and those that were \u201ctrue in virtue of fact\u201d (hence\nonly contingently true). The former \u201canalytic\u201d\ntruths were the proper domain of philosophy; the latter\n\u201csynthetic\u201d truths the proper domain of empirical science.\nQuine argued that the distinction could not be sustained: all\nstatements are, in principle, answerable to experience, and,\nconversely, all statements can be maintained in the face of experience\nas long as we adjust other parts of our picture of the world. So there\nis no hard distinction between claims that are \u201ctrue in virtue\nof meaning\u201d and \u201ctrue in virtue of facts,\u201d or\nbetween \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d truths;\nthere is simply the socio-historical fact that, at any given point in\nthe history of inquiry, there are some statements we are unlikely to\ngive up in the face of recalcitrant empirical evidence and others that\nwe are quite willing to give up in light of new empirical\nevidence.\n\nWithout a domain of analytic truths\u2014truths that are a\npriori and hold in virtue of meaning\u2014it becomes unclear\nwhat special domain of expertise for philosophical reflection remains.\nIf all claims are, in principle, revisable in light of empirical\nevidence, why not let all questions fall to empirical science?\nPhilosophy would be out of business, except perhaps as the abstract,\nreflective branch of empirical science. This Quinean attack has\nconsequences for the traditional philosophical business of conceptual\nanalysis, since on the dominant view from Plato through Carnap\n\u201cevery analysis of a concept is inextricably bound to a\ncollection of purported analyticities\u201d (Laurence & Margolis\n1999, p. 18). The conclusion Replacement Naturalists draw from the\npreceding is that since any claim of conceptual analysis is vulnerable\nto the demands of a posteriori (i.e., empirical) theory\nconstruction, philosophy must proceed in tandem with empirical\nscience, not as the arbiter of its claims, but as a reflective attempt\nat synoptic clarity about the state of empirical knowledge.\n\nMany resist this conclusion. According to one proponent, a conceptual\nanalysis proceeds \u201cby appeal to what seems to us most obvious\nand central about [the concept in question]\u2026as revealed by our\nintuitions about possible cases\u201d (Jackson 1998, p. 31).\n\u201c[T]he general coincidence in intuitive responses [to possible\ncases] reveals something about the folk theory of [the concept in\nquestion]\u201d (Jackson, 1998, p. 32). But the question that plagues\nconceptual analysis, post-Quine, is what kind of knowledge\nsuch a procedure actually yields. Why should ordinary intuitions about\nthe extension of a concept be deemed reliable or informative? Why\nthink the \u201cfolk\u201d are right?\n\nThe track record of a priori methods like appeal to\nintuitions and conceptual analysis is not a promising one (e.g.,\nHarman 1994; Hintikka 1999). Kant, for example, took it to be a\npriori that space necessarily had the structure described by\nEuclidean geometry; subsequent physics showed his intuitions to be\nmistaken. The lesson naturalists draw from this track record of a\npriori philosophy is well-expressed by Cummins (1999, pp.\n117\u201318):\n\nWe can give up on intuitions about the nature of space and time and\nask instead what sort of beasts space and time must be if current\nphysical theory is to be true and explanatory. We can give up on\nintuitions about representational content and ask instead what\nrepresentation must be if current cognitive theory is to be true and\nexplanatory.\n\n\nFor the Replacement Naturalist, in short, the only sound reason to\nprefer a proposed conceptual analysis is not because it seems\nintuitively obvious, but because it earns its place by figuring in\nsuccessful a posteriori theories of the world. Philosophy\nqua conceptual analysis and intuition-pumping should be\nabandoned in favor of empirical science; philosophy is simply the more\nabstract and reflective part of empirical science and lays claim to no\ndistinctive methods or body of knowledge.\n\nDefenders of conceptual analysis, it is true, commonly proclaim the\nmodesty of their ambitions. Indeed, Frank Jackson specifically\nchastises conceptual analysis in its \u201cimmodest role,\u201d\nnamely when \u201cit gives intuitions\u2026too big a place in\ndetermining what the world is like\u201d (1998, pp. 43\u201344):\n\u201cThere is nothing sacrosanct about folk theory. It has served us\nwell but not so well that it would be irrational to make changes to it\nin the light of reflection on exactly what it involves, and in the\nlight of one or another empirical discovery about us and our\nworld\u201d (Jackson 1998, p. 44). The question is, having conceded\nthis much, what remains? Conceptual analysis, as Jackson conceives it,\nbecomes hard to distinguish from banal descriptive sociology of the\nGallup-poll variety. (Jackson even says he advocates, when necessary,\n\u201cdoing serious opinion polls on people\u2019s responses to\nvarious cases\u201d [1998, p. 36].) Such a procedure might deliver\nsome insight about what some people, at some time, in some place,\nthink about \u201cmind\u201d or \u201claw\u201d or\n\u201cjustice,\u201d but Replacement Naturalists wonder what\nphilosophical import any of this data could have, since it is bounded\nnot simply by time and place, but also by ignorance. Yet, as Ian\nFarrell (2006) has argued, such a procedure may serve an important\ntheoretical purpose, even if its claims are vulnerable to\nrevision.\n\nHow might Replacement Naturalism in legal philosophy, motivated by\nthese Quinean doubts about conceptual analysis and intuitions,\nproceed? Leiter (2001b) suggests one possibility, which invokes the\nfollowing example. Joseph Raz (1985) has offered an influential\nconceptual argument against Soft Legal Positivism\u2019s claim that\nthere is no constraint on the content of a rule of recognition beyond\nthe fact that it is a social rule: its existence-conditions are given\nby the actual practice of officials in deciding disputes, but what\ncriteria of legality officials appeal to (i.e., the content\nof the rule of recognition) is dependent upon whatever the\nconventional practice of officials in that society happens to be. Raz\noffers an analysis of the concept of authority to show that Soft\nPositivism is incompatible, even in principle, with the law\u2019s\nhaving the authority it claims to have. According to Raz, it is a\nnon-normative prerequisite for a claim to authority that it be\npossible to identify the authority\u2019s directive without reference\nto the underlying \u201cdependent\u201d reasons for that directive.\nThis is a prerequisite for authority because what\ndistinguishes a (practical) authority, on Raz\u2019s\n\u201cservice\u201d conception, is that its directives preempt\nconsideration of the underlying reasons for what we ought to do, and\nthereby make it more likely that we will do what we really ought to\ndo. Authoritative reasons are claimed to be exclusionary reasons,\nexcluding from consideration those dependent reasons (including,\nimportantly, moral reasons) on which the authoritative directive\nrests. Soft Positivism, then, undermines the possibility of the rule\nof recognition claiming authority, since for Soft Positivism a rule of\nrecognition can, in principle, employ dependent reasons as criteria of\nlegal validity. Thus, it would be impossible to identify such a\nrule of recognition\u2019s directives about legal validity without\nrecourse to precisely the dependent reasons the rule was supposed to\npreempt.\n\nOne line of response to Raz has appealed to contrary intuitions about\nthe concept of authority. Stephen Perry (1987), for example, argues\nthat authoritative reasons need not be exclusionary in Raz\u2019s\nsense; it suffices, Perry says, that they simply be\n\u201cweightier\u201d than other reasons. Some commentators\u2019\nintuitions line up with Raz\u2019s (Leiter 2001b), others with Perry\n(Waluchow 1994). Now, of course, the Quinean worries about conceptual\nanalysis hold even in cases where everyone\u2019s intuitions about a\nconcept coincide; but when they do not coincide, the inadequacies of\nthe philosophical methods at hand seem especially acute. Some\nproponents of traditional methods of legal philosophy object that\n\u201cthe mere fact that there is disagreement about what the\nconceptual truths of law are\u2026does not mean that conceptual\nanalysis of law is fruitless. If that were the case, we should have to\nconclude the same about philosophy generally\u201d (Coleman 2001, p.\n211 n. 38). Unfortunately, this reductio response depends on\na conclusion that the Replacement Naturalist is, in fact, prepared to\nembrace\u2014and not because the Replacement Naturalist naively\nbelieves empirical methods \u201cwould\u2026put an end to disputes\nabout the nature of law or anything else\u201d (Coleman 2001, p. 211\nn.38). The worry, rather, is that intuitions about concepts enjoy no\nprivileged epistemic status, while claims in empirical science do.\nEven if empirical science does not resolve these disputes, it at least\ndelineates criteria with epistemic weight for adjudicating them. The\ncrucial question, then, becomes whether our best empirical science\nrequires drawing the conceptual lines one way rather than another.\n\nThe leading social-scientific accounts of judicial\ndecision-making\u2014both the informal ones (Pritchett 1949; Powe\n2000) and the formal ones (Segal & Spaeth 1993)\u2014have two\nstriking features in this regard. First, they all aim to account\nfor the relative causal contribution of \u201claw\u201d and non-law\nfactors (e.g., political ideologies or \u201cattitudes\u201d) to\njudicial decisions. Second, they demarcate \u201claw\u201d from\nnon-law factors in typical Hard Positivist terms, i.e., they generally\ntreat as \u201claw\u201d only pedigreed norms, like legislative\nenactments and prior holdings of courts (as well as, sometimes, the\ninterpretive methods applied to these kinds of legal sources: see the\ntreatment of the \u201clegal model\u201d in Segal & Spaeth 1993,\npp. 33\u201353). If these models were ultimately vindicated\nempirically\u2014and not just for American courts\u2014this would\ngive the Replacement Naturalist reason to abandon any a\npriori, intuitive confidence we had about the concept of law that\nconflicted with Hard Positivism\u2014just as the role of\nnon-Euclidean geometry in parts of physics has led everyone\nto repudiate Kant\u2019s a priori intuitive confidence about\nthe Euclidean structure of space. If social science really cuts the\ncausal joints of the legal world in Hard Positivist terms, the\nReplacement Naturalist argues, that is a compelling reason to work\nwith that concept of law as against its competitors.\n\nProponents of conceptual analysis, by contrast, are skeptical that the\nexplanatory premises of empirical social scientists give us any reason\nto prefer one concept of law to another. Notice, of course, that an\nanalogous skepticism is available to the diehard Euclidean: after all,\nnon-Euclidean geometries are famously non-intuitive and hard to grasp.\nBut even those sympathetic to Kant\u2019s view that space is\nnecessarily Euclidean would have to admit that such a response would\nbe unmotivated: if non-Euclidean geometry does explanatory work within\nsuccessful physical theory, then the right conclusion to draw is that\nour intuitions about the structure of space need tutoring to keep pace\nwith empirical knowledge. So, too, the analogous question for the\nnatural lawyer or Soft Positivist is: why think your intuitions are\nepistemically privileged as opposed to simply untutored by the best\nempirical science?\n\nThe skeptic, however, might refine the challenge as follows:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she might say, \u201cthat I insist on\nsticking to my intuitions, empirical science be damned. Rather, I do\nnot see why the empirical science at issue needs to take\nsides on a dispute about the concept of law.\u201d Of course, it is\nclear that the empirical social science at issue draws the line\nbetween legal and non-legal norms based on pedigree criteria, but the\nquestion is whether it needs to: the natural lawyer could\nagree with the social scientists that, e.g., moral and political\nconsiderations determine judicial decisions, but contest the\nassumption that these considerations are not themselves legally\nbinding.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is that the candidate non-law explanatory\nfactors at issue (e.g., an ideological commitment to the Republican\nParty platform) are not plausible candidates for being legal norms, on\nany existing theory of the concept of law. Moreover, there are good\nreasons why social science treats the explanatory factors at issue as\nnon-legal. For example, the moral and political attitudes invoked\nto explain decisions do not appear explicitly in the text of judicial\nopinions or in courts\u2019 explicit rationales for\nreaching particular outcomes; they are often hidden and\nhard to detect, which makes them quite unlike any of the\nparadigm instances of legal norms, such as statutory provisions or\njudicial precedents. Finally, the legal/non-legal demarcation in\nempirical social science usually reflects more general explanatory\npremises about the psycho-social factors that account for behavior,\nwell beyond the realm of the legal. The motivation for demarcating the\nlegal/non-legal in essentially Hard Positivist terms is, for most\nsocial scientists, to effect an explanatory unification of legal\nphenomena with other political and social behavior.\n\nYet the very talk of \u201clegal phenomena\u201d may invite a\ndifferent kind of objection to the proposed naturalization of\njurisprudential questions. For how is it, one might wonder, that the\nsocial scientist knows these are legal phenomena he is\nexplaining, and not phenomena of some other kind? Does that not\nalready presuppose an analysis of the concept of law? (Cf. Coleman\n2001, pp. 213\u2013214.) It is not obvious, though, why a shared\nlanguage and dictionaries (or even an explicit definition of terms,\nas, for example, Newton deploys at the start of Principia\nMathematica) won\u2019t often suffice to get empirical science\noff the ground. It is not that empirical science needs\nconceptual analysis to tell this explanatory story, it\u2019s rather\nthat after the fact the philosopher may be able to offer some\ngreater reflective clarity about the concepts invoked in the\nexplanatory story. To the extent a conceptual analysis helps, it helps\nafter we discover which way of cutting the causal joints of\nthe social world works best, according to the naturalist.\n\nAll these rejoinders on behalf of naturalism, however, are predicated\non the assumption that we have a robust social-scientific account of\nlaw. Yet it is now plain we do not. (See, e.g., Leiter 2007, pp. 192\nff.) The best social-scientific accounts of adjudication, for\nexample, boast predictive success that is so feeble (better than\ncoin-tosses, but not much!) that their explanatory models, with their\nimplicit concepts of law, earn no epistemic credence. When it comes to\nthe \u201cconcept of law\u201d itself, we may have nothing more than\nintuitions, however epistemically feeble, on which to rely. And\nperhaps they are not as epistemically feeble as the naturalist\noriginally thought? Law, after all, is not a natural kind, but a\ncomplicated kind of social artifact, and it seems far more plausible\nthat social artifacts will depend on folk intuitions and how people\nuse language: so perhaps traditional conceptual-analytic methodology,\nof the kind H.L.A. Hart utilized in The Concept of\nLaw, is the right one after all for its subject-matter (cf.\nLanglinais & Leiter 2016)?\n",
