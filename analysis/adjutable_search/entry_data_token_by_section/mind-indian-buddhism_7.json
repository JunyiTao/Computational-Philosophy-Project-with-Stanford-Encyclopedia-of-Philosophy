    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition || Overview of the Abhidharma Synthesis\n3.1 Overview of the Abhidharma Synthesis\n\n\nA few clarifications about the origins and scope of the Abhidharma\nscholastic are necessary before we explore its analysis of mind.\nFirst, as the name suggest, the Abhidharma (\u2018about\u2019\n(abhi) + \u2018the doctrine\u2019 (dharma),\nusually translated as \u2018higher doctrine\u2019) is concerned with\nthe notion of dharma, its central and most difficult\nconcept. Depending on the context, a dharma may be taken to\ndesignate either the body of teachings attributed to the Buddha or a\nbasic element or unit of existence and/or experience, better captured\nby the notion of phenomenon. In the Abhidharmic analysis of mind and\nmental constituents, a dharma most closely refers to a\ntemporal instance in the stream of cognitive events, which is\nmomentary and discrete, that arises together with a moment of\ncognitive awareness (a vij\u00f1\u0101na). In this extended\nsense, a dharma designates both an indivisible unit of\nexperience and an object of conceptual analysis, which means that\nfactors contributing to the arising of cognitive awareness can in turn\nbecome objects of reflective inquiry. \n\n\nA large body of literature concerned with examining the received \nteachings had emerged roughly three centuries after the death of the \nBuddha (ca. 150 B.C.E.). The origins of the Abhidharma schools are \nthus traceable to the diverse interpretations of the Buddha's \nteachings. Two main branches of Abhidharma \nare extant: that of the Therav\u0101da (\u2018Doctrines of the \nElders\u2019), which became dominant in Sri Lanka and southeast \nAsia, and that of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da (the \u2018All Exists \nSchool\u2019), which flourished in North India and provided the \nbasis for the development of later Abhidharma and Mah\u0101y\u0101na \nschools in India, and later on in Central and East Asia. The \nfoundational texts for these two branches of Abhidharma are the \nKath\u0101vatthu (\u2018Points of Controversy\u2019) and \nthe Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 (\u2018The Great \nCommentary\u2019).\n\n\nThe four main schools of Indian Buddhism emerge almost exclusively \nfrom the Northen branch of Abhidharma. The \nMah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 itself is associated with \nthe first of these schools, the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika \n(\u2018Follower of the \nVibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u2019). The other three schools are\nthose of the Sautr\u0101ntika (\u2018Follower of the \nS\u016btra\u2019), Madhyamaka (\u2018Middle Way School\u2019) and \nYog\u0101c\u0101ra (\u2018Practice of Yoga School\u2019). The \nSautr\u0101ntika doctrines survive primarily in later texts such as \nVasubandhu's Abhidharmako\u015ba (\u2018Treasury of Higher \nKnowledge,\u2019 ca. 360 C.E.) and Vimalamitra's \nAbhidharmad\u012bpa (\u2018Light of Higher \nKnowledge,\u2019 ca. 500 C.E.). The Madhyamaka School is associated \nwith the emergence of the vast corpus of \nPraj\u00f1ap\u0101ramit\u0101 (\u2018Perfection of \nWisdom\u2019) literature and with the works of the prominent \nBuddhist philosopher N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (fl. ca. 150 C.E.), \nprincipally with his magnum opus, the \nM\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101s (\u2018Verses on the \nFoundation of the Middle Way\u2019). Lastly, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra,\nwhich became the dominant philosophical school in India from the 5th \nthrough the 12th century traces it origins to the encyclopedic work \nof Asa\u1e45ga (ca. 315\u2013390) and his half brother Vasubandhu \n(320\u2013380). Asa\u1e45ga is credited with the authorship of the \nMah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha (\u2018Compendium of the \nGreat Vehicle\u2019) and the encyclopedic \nYog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi\u015b\u0101stra \n(\u2018Treatise on the Stages of the Practice of Yoga,\u2019 most \nlikely a compilation by various authors). Vasubandhu is the author of\nsome of the most influential works of Indian Buddhist philosophy, \nwhich include, apart from his Treasury of Higher Knowledge \n(written from a Sautr\u0101ntika perspective) such seminal texts as \nthe Madhy\u0101ntavibh\u0101gabh\u0101\u1e63ya \n(\u2018Commentary on the Separation of the Middle from \nExtremes\u2019), the Trisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba \n(\u2018Teaching of the Three Self-Natures\u2019), and the pithy but\ninfluential Vi\u1e43\u015batik\u0101k\u0101rik\u0101 \n(\u2018The Twenty Verses\u2019) and \nTri\u1e43\u015bikak\u0101rik\u0101 (\u2018Thirty \nVerses\u2019) (see \n \u00a76.3\n for a discussion of the main arguments for idealism presented by \nVasubandhu in the Twenty Verses).\n\n\nA wide gulf separates works such as Vasubandhu's Treasury of\nHigher Knowledge, a foundational text for most of the\nphilosophical developments of late Indian Buddhism, from the simple\nand pragmatic teachings of the Buddha. The Abhidharma scholastic\nevolved from mnemonic lists (m\u0101t\u1e5bka) that were\ninitially intended to work as summaries of various topics discussed in\nthe canonical texts. These lists were usually structured around five\nmain categories: form or matter (r\u016bpa), mind or\nconsciousness (citta), mental constituents (caitta),\nconditioned factors dissociated from consciousness\n(cittaviprayukta sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra), and unconditioned\nelements (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta) such as cessation or\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a. In composing his Treasury of Higher\nKnowledge, Vasubandhu mainly relied on three Abhidharma texts:\nDharma\u015bri's An Epitome of Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmas\u0101ra), Gho\u1e63aka's The Nectar of\nAbhidharma (Abhidharm\u0101m\u1e5bta\u015b\u0101stra)\nand K\u0101ty\u0101yan\u012bputra's Method of Knowing\n(J\u00f1\u0101naprasth\u0101na) (see Frauwallner 1963, 1971a,\n1971b). From these three works Vasubandhu adopted his categorical\nclassification of Abhidharma topics according to the five\naggregates. The analytic models of the five categories and the five\naggregates represent, thus, \u201can attempt to record exhaustively\nall the elements of being and order them systematically\u201d\n(Frauwallner 1995, 146). Such efforts were not new: indeed, the\nBuddhist attempt mirrors similar undertakings in the Brahmanical\ntradition. A good example of such undertakings is the\nS\u0101\u1e43khya scheme of the mental and physical elements and\ntheir derivatives. \n",
