    "main_text": "Evoking religious emotion\n8. Evoking religious emotion\n\nMost straightforwardly it has been maintained that the One is holy\nbecause we feel a particular set of religious emotions towards it\n(Levine 1994, ch.2.2). For Rudolf Otto (1917), whatever is holy or\n\u2018numinous\u2019 is so characterised on the basis of our\nnon-rational, non-sensory experience of it rather than its own\nobjective features and, taking its departure from Otto\u2019s work,\none approach has been to argue that the feelings of awe which people\nfeel towards God can be, and often are, applied to the universe\nitself (Byerly 2019). Whether it is really possible, or appropriate,\nto entertain such feelings towards the cosmos as a whole will be\ndiscussed below, but the chief point to make here concerns the extreme\nsubjectivism of this response; it\u2019s coming to rest upon feelings\nwhich, while sincere enough, indicate nothing whatsoever about the\nuniverse itself. On this view, all that distinguishes a pantheist from\nan atheist is feeling; a certain emotional reaction or\nconnection that we feel to the universe. It would become akin, say, to\nthe difference between one who loves art and another who is relatively\nindifferent to it. Prima facie, however, this approach puts\nthe cart before the horse; rather than say that the One is divine\nbecause we feel a set of religious emotions towards it, it seems more\nappropriate to suppose that we feel those emotions towards it because\nwe think it is divine.\n",
