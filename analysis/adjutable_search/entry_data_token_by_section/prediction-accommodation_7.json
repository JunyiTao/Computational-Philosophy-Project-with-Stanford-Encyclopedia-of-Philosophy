    "main_text": "The Null Support Thesis || Arbitrary and Non-Arbitrary Conjunctions\n6.3 Arbitrary and Non-Arbitrary Conjunctions\n\nLange (2001) offers an alternate interpretation of the coin flip\nexample that claims that the process of accommodation (unlike\nprediction) tends to generate theories that are not strongly supported\nby confirming data. He imagines a \u2018tweaked\u2019 version of the\ncoin flip example in which the initial 99 outcomes form a strict\nalternating sequence \u2018tails heads tails heads\u2026\u2019\n(instead of forming the \u2018apparently random sequence\u2019 of\noutcomes provided in the original case). Again we imagine a predictor\nwho correctly predicts 99 outcomes in advance and an accommodator who\nwitnesses them. Both the predictor and the accommodator predict that\nthe 100th outcome will be tails. Now there is little or no\ndifference in our assessed probability that the subject will correctly\npredicted the 100th outcome. \n\n\nThis suggests that the intuitive difference between Maher\u2019s\noriginal pair of examples does not reflect a difference between\nprediction and accommodation per se. (Lange 2001: 580)\n\n\nLange\u2019s analysis appeals to what Goodman called an\n\u2018arbitrary conjunction\u2019\u2014the mark of which is that\n\n\n\nestablishment of one component endows the whole statement with no\ncredibility that is transmitted to other component statements. (1983:\n68\u20139) \n\n\nAn example of an arbitrary conjunction is \u201cThe sun is made of\nhelium and August 3rd 2017 falls on a Thursday and 17 is a\nprime number\u201d. In the original coin flip case, we judge that\nH is weakly supported in the accommodator\u2019s scenario\nbecause we judge that the apparently random sequence of outcomes is\nprobably an arbitrary conjunction\u2014thus the fact that the initial\n99 conjuncts are confirmed implies almost nothing about what the\n100th outcome will be. But the success of the predictor in\npredicting the initial 99 outcomes strongly implies that the sequence\nis not an arbitrary conjunction after all: \n\n\n(w)e now believe it more likely that the agent was led to posit this\nparticular sequence by way of something we have not noticed that ties\nthe sequence together\u2014that would keep it from being a\ncoincidence that the hypothesis is accurate to the 100th\ntoss\u2026. (Lange 2001: 581) \n\n\nHaving judged it not to be an arbitrary conjunction, we are now\nprepared to recognize the first 99 outcomes as strongly confirming the\nprediction in the 100th case. What accounts for the\ndifference between the two scenarios, in other words, is not primarily\nwhether E was predicted or accommodated, but whether we judge\nH to be an arbitrary conjunction, and thus whether E\nprovides support for the remaining portion of H. \n\nThus in Lange\u2019s tweaked case, the non-existence of the\npredictivist effect is due to the fact that it is clear from the\ninitial 99 flips that the sequence is not an arbitrary\nconjunction\u2014thus E confirms H equally strongly in\nboth scenarios. \n\nLange goes on to suggest that in actual science the practice of\nconstructing a hypothesis by way of accommodating known evidence has a\ntendency to generate arbitrary conjunctions. Thus Lorentz\u2019s\ncontraction hypothesis, when appended to his electrodynamics to\naccommodate the failure to detect optically any motion with respect to\nthe aether, resulted in an arbitrary conjunction (since evidence that\nsupported the contraction hypothesis did not support the\nelectrodynamics, or vice versa)\u2014essentially for this reason,\nLange argues, it was rejected by Einstein as ad hoc. When evidence is\npredicted by a theory, by contrast, this is typically because the\ntheory is not an arbitrary conjunction. The evidential significance of\nprediction and accommodation for Lange is that they tend to be\ncorrelated (negatively and positively) with the construction of\ntheories that are arbitrary conjunctions. Lange\u2019s view might\nthus be classed as a weak heuristic predictivism, though Lange never\ntakes a stand on whether scientists actually rely on such correlations\nin assessing theories. \n\nFor critical discussion of Lange\u2019s theory see Worrall 2014:\n59\u201361 and Harker 2006: 317f.\n",
