    "main_text": "Composition Principles || Infinitary Bounds and Sums\n4.3 Infinitary Bounds and Sums\n\nOne can get even stronger composition principles by considering\ninfinitary bounds and sums. For example, (P.11\u03be) can be\ngeneralized to a principle to the effect that any non-empty\nset of (two or more) entities satisfying a suitable condition\n\u03c8 has an upper bound. Strictly speaking, there is a difficulty in\nexpressing such a principle in a standard first-order language. Some\nearly theories, such as those of Tarski (1929) and Leonard and Goodman\n(1940), require explicit quantification over sets (see Niebergall\n2009a, 2009b; Goodman produced a set-free version of the calculus of\nindividuals in 1951). Others, such as Lewis's (1991), resort to the\nmachinery of plural quantification of Boolos (1984). One can, however,\navoid all this and achieve a sufficient degree of generality by\nrelying on an axiom schema where sets are identified by predicates or\nopen formulas. Since an ordinary first-order language has a\ndenumerable supply of open formulas, at most denumerably many sets (in\nany given domain) can be specified in this way. But for most purposes\nthis limitation is negligible, as normally we are only interested in\nthose sets of objects that we are able to specify. Thus, for most\npurposes the following axiom schema will do, where \u2018\u03c6\u2019\nis any formula in the language and \u2018\u03c8\u2019 expresses the\ncondition in question:\n\n\n(P.14\u03c8)\nGeneral \u03c8-Bound\n\n(\u2203w\u03c6w \u2227\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 \u03c8w)) \u2192\n\u2203z\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192\nPwz). \n\n\n(The first conjunct in the antecedent is simply to guarantee that\n\u2018\u03c6\u2019 picks out a non-empty set, while in the\nconsequent the variable \u2018z\u2019 is assumed not to\noccur free in \u2018\u03c8\u2019.) The three binary sum axioms\ncorresponding to the schema in (P.12\u03be,i) can be\nstrengthened in a similar fashion as follows:\n\n\n(P.15\u03c8,i)\nGeneral \u03c8-Sumi\n\n(\u2203w\u03c6w \u2227\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 \u03c8w)) \u2192\n\u2203zSiz\u03c6w, \n\n\nwhere\n\n\n(521)\nGeneral\n Sum1[21]\n\nS1z\u03c6w =df\n\u2200v(Pzv \u2194\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 Pwv)) \n\n(522)\nGeneral Sum2\n\nS2z\u03c6w =df\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 Pwz) \u2227\n\u2200v(Pvz \u2192\n\u2203w(\u03c6w \u2227 Ovw)) \n\n(523)\nGeneral Sum3\n\nS3z\u03c6w =df\n\u2200v(Ovz \u2194\n\u2203w(\u03c6w \u2227 Ovw)). \n\n\n(Here, \u2018Siz\u03c6w\u2019 may be\nread: \u2018z is a sumi of every\nw such that \u03c6w\u2019 and, again,\n\u2018z\u2019 and \u2018v\u2019 are assumed not\nto occur free in \u03c6; similar restrictions will apply below.) Thus,\neach (P.15\u03c8,i) says that if there are some\n\u03c6-ers, and if every \u03c6-er satisfies condition \u03c8, then the\n\u03c6-ers have a sum of the relevant type. It can be checked that each\nvariant of (P.15\u03c8,i) includes the\ncorresponding finitely principle (P.12\u03c8,i) as\na special case, taking \u2018\u03c6w\u2019 to be the formula\n\u2018w=x \u2228 w=y\u2019 and\n\u2018\u03c8w\u2019 the condition\n\u2018(w=x \u2192 \u03bewy) \u2227\n(w=y \u2192 \u03bexw)\u2019. And, again, it\nturns out that in the presence of Strong Supplementation,\n(P.15\u03c8,2) and (P.15\u03c8,3) are equivalent.\n\n\nOne could also consider here a generalized version of the Product\nprinciple (P.13\u03be), asserting the conditional existence\nof a maximal common overlapper\u2014a common \u201cnucleus\u201d,\nin the terminology of Leonard and Goodman (1940)\u2014for any\nnon-empty set of entities satisfying a suitable condition. Adapting\nfrom Goodman (1951: 37), such a principle could be stated as\nfollows:\n\n\n(P.16\u03c8)\nGeneral \u03c8-Product\n\n(\u2203w\u03c6w \u2227\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 \u03c8w)) \u2192\n\u2203zRz\u03c6w, \n\n\nwhere\n\n\n(53)\nGeneral Product\n\nRz\u03c6w =df\n\u2200v(Pvz \u2194\n\u2200w(\u03c6w \u2192 Pvw)) \n\n\nand \u2018\u03c8w\u2019 expresses a condition at least as\nstrong as \u2018\u2200x(\u03c6x \u2192\nOwx)\u2019 (again, unless one assumes the Bottom principle\n(P.10)). This principle includes the finitary version\n(P.13\u03be) as a special case, taking\n\u2018\u03c6w\u2019 and \u2018\u03c8w\u2019 as\nabove, so the remarks we made in connection with the latter apply\nhere. An additional remark, however, is in order. For there is a sense\nin which (P.16\u03c8) might be thought to be redundant in\nthe presence of the infinitary sum principles in\n(P.15\u03c8,i). Intuitively, a maximal common\noverlapper (i.e., a product) of a set of overlapping entities is\nsimply a minimal underlapper (a sum) of their common parts; that is\nprecisely the sense in which a product principle qualifies as a\ncomposition principle. Thus, intuitively, each of the infinitary sum\nprinciples above should have a substitution instance that yields\n(P.16\u03c8) as a theorem, at least when\n\u2018\u03c8w\u2019 is as strong as indicated. However, it\nturns out that this is not generally the case unless one assumes\nextensionality. In particular, it is easy to see that\n(P.15\u03c8,3) does not generally imply\n(P.16\u03c8), for it may not even imply the binary version\n(P.13\u03be). This can be verified by taking\n\u2018\u03bexy\u2019 and \u2018\u03c8w\u2019 to\nexpress just the requirement of overlap, i.e., the conditions\n\u2018Oxy\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2200x(\u03c6x \u2192 Owx)\u2019,\nrespectively, and considering again the non-extensional model\ndiagrammed in Figure 4. In that model, x and y do\nnot have a product, since neither is part of the other and neither\nz nor w includes the other as a part. Thus,\n(P.13\u03be) fails, which is to say that\n(P.16\u03c8) fails when \u2018\u03c6\u2019 picks out the\nset {x, y}; yet (P.15\u03c8,3) holds, for both\nz and w are things that overlap exactly those things\nthat overlap some common part of the \u03c6-ers, i.e., of x\nand y. \n\nIn the literature, this fact has been neglected until recently (Pontow\n2004). It is, nonetheless, of major significance for a full\nunderstanding of (the limits of) non-extensional mereologies. As we\nshall see in the next section, it is also important when it comes to\nthe axiomatic structure of mereology, including the axiomatics of the\nmost classical theories.\n",
