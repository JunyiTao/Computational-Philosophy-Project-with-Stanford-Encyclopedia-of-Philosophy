    "main_text": "Philosophy: Following the Thread of Intuition || Examination\n5.2 Examination\n\n\nEarlier attempts to explain the phenomenon of prophecy in terms of the then-accepted workings of the human psyche, for example, that of\nMaimonides, found analogous or proto-prophetic symptoms in two types\nof human inspiration. The first of these includes veridical dreams,\ndivination, and other cases in which the unknown is revealed. The\nsecond comprises instances where people spontaneously perform acts of\nbravery, leadership, or literary creativity, and thus act in a manner\nthat appears to be above the ordinary. These ideas were helpful in\ndeveloping a political theory of prophecy; the prophet, like the\nphilosopher-king, is a visionary, gifted with bold leadership as well\nas the ability to impose a code of behavior upon his people. The main\ndifference is that the code of the prophet is expressly not of his own\ndevise, but rather revealed by some supernal source. On the whole, Ibn\nKammuna downplays the political function of prophecy. The prophet does\nhave an important role to play in organizing and ordering society.\nHowever, the thrust of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s analysis emphasizes the\nepistemological advantages of the prophet rather than his political\nskill. Moreover, as political leader, he is charged with inculcating\ncorrect religious belief; Ibn Kammuna sharply distinguishes between\nthe prophet on the one hand, and rulers of jahiliyya\n(uncultured, lacking a proper revealed code) cities on the other.\n\n\nThe prophet\u2019s distinction from others is to be explained in\npsychological terms by the perfection of his h\u0323ads. In\ndeveloping this theme, Ibn Kammuna makes the bold claim that\nh\u0323ads is the ultimate basis of all human knowledge. All\nknowledge that is acquired is either a direct intuition, acquired by\nsomeone suitably equipped, or instruction in items of knowledge that\nhas been acquired by someone else by intuition:\n\n\nAs for their [prophets\u2019] perfection, it is due to the perfection of\ntheir speculative intellect, and for this reason. The middle term, by\nmeans of which one succeeds in acquiring intelligibles that were\n[hitherto] unknown, is at times obtained by means of h\u0323ads, at\nothers by means of instruction. However, h\u0323ads is the basis of\ninstruction. Things thus trace back without a doubt to intuitions\nwhich the masters [of intuition] arrived at. They then conveyed them\nto students. However, it is possible for someone to have an intuition\non his own; the reasoning gels in his mind without a teacher.\n[Perlmann (ed.) 1971, p. 12; translation by the author]\n\n\nHumans exhibit the full range of endowments, from the dull witted who\nnever intuit, to those who are able to satisfy all or nearly all of\ntheir quests by means of intuition. The variation is seen both in the\nquantity of percepts that are obtained intuitively as well as in the\nspeed of intuitive act. (Nonetheless, it should be added that Ibn\nKammuna places the limit at \u201cthe quickest and shortest\ninstant\u201d; unlike Ibn Sina, for example, he does not claim here\nthat intuition takes no time at all.) It is certainly possible that,\nat the upper bounds of human capacity, one may find an individual\nblessed with \u201can intense purity and an intense connection to the\nsupernal sources\u201d such that he can intuit all or most of what\nhumans are capable of knowing, \u201cnot by means of an uncertain\ntradition, but by means of middle terms and demonstrative\nproofs.\u201d H\u0323ads accounts not only for the quickness and\nindependence of the prophet\u2019s knowledge, but for its certainty as\nwell. It meets the requirements of formal logic, since it supplies the\nmiddle term of the syllogism, and hence is demonstrative.\n",
