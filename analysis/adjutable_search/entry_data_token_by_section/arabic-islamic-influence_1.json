    "main_text": "Division of the Sciences\n2. Division of the Sciences\n\nArabic divisions of the sciences influenced the Latin West mainly\nthrough Dominicus Gundisalvi\u2019 treatise Division of\nPhilosophy (De divisione philosophiae). In this text,\nGundisalvi reuses much material from his own abbreviating translation\nof al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Enumeration of the\nSciences (I\u1e25\u1e63\u0101\u02be\nal-\u02bful\u016bm), of which a second, more literal translation\nwas produced by Gerard of Cremona. But it was Gundisalvi\u2019s own\nArabicized treatise which was the main channel of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s influence. The mostly anonymous\nintroductory literature for artes students of the thirteenth\ncentury draws amply on Gundisalvi\u2019s treatise, sometimes\nreferring to Gundisalvi as \u201cAlpharabius\u201d (Lafleur 1988,\n341n). The translator Michael Scot also writes his own Division of\nphilosophy, in which he adopts substantial material from Gundisalvi,\nbut arranges it according to his own scheme (Burnett 1997).\n\nGundisalvi adopts central principles for the division of the sciences\nfrom Avicenna: that the principal criterion of division between the\nsciences is their subject matter; that a science cannot demonstrate\nthe existence of its own subject matter; and that there are two kinds\nof subordination of a science: either as a part (pars) of\nanother science, when it studies a part of its subject matter, or as a\nspecies (species) of another science, when it studies the\nsubject matter in a specific respect (Hugonnard-Roche 1984;\nFidora & Werner 2007, 24\u201335).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s influence is particularly obvious in\nthe enumeration of the seven parts of grammar, the eight parts of\nnatural science (covering the spectrum of Aristotle\u2019s libri\nnaturales), and the seven parts of mathematics: arithmetic,\nmusic, geometry, optics, astrology, astronomy, the science of weights,\nthe science of technical devices (ingenia) (see the tables in\nBouyges 1923, 65\u201369). As to the discipline of logic, Gundisalvi\nexplicitly embraces al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s division into\neight parts, following the tradition which makes Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric and Poetic parts of logic. The Farabian\ndivision of logic into eight parts reappears, for example, in Roger\nBacon (Maier\u00f9 1987) and in Arnoul de Provence\u2019s\nDivision of the Sciences (ca. 1250); Arnoul remarks that\nneither Aristotle nor common usage includes Rhetoric and\nPoetic among the parts of logic (Lafleur 1988, 342).\nGundisalvi further distinguishes with al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b between\nfive kinds of syllogistic reasoning, of which demonstration is the\nhighest. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s emphasis on demonstration as\nthe pivotal means for the acquisition of certain knowledge is an\nimportant innovation of Arabic philosophy, which reached the Latin\nWest via Gundisalvi (Fidora 2007).\n\nThe influence of al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s Enumeration of\nthe Sciences extends also to specific areas such as music (Farmer\n1934, 31\u201334). In general, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s and\nGundisalvi\u2019s works were instrumental in disseminating a\nsystematic division of the sciences which integrated the full range of\nAristotle\u2019s works and a broad spectrum of sciences, many of\nwhich were new to the Latin West (Burnett 2011).\n",
