    "main_text": "Recognition || Secondary versus Primary Recognition\n5.3 Secondary versus Primary Recognition\n\nA key distinction in his theory is between (a) primary recognition,\ni.e. of a characteristic presented in experience, and (b) secondary\nrecognition, i.e. of something beyond what is presented in experience\n(1953a: 44ff). His favourite examples are recognising an instance of\nred (primary), and recognising a lump of lead (secondary). Price\nclaims that in recognising it as lead the subject goes beyond the\ncharacteristics she notices. Rather, she treats the presented features\nas signs (see\n \u00a75.4\n below; 1953a: ch. 4).\n\nObviously, secondary recognition can be mistaken. Price calls such\nmistakes, \u201cerrors of recognition\u201d (1953a: ch. 3). Someone\ncould take a grey lump to be lead even if it was not. But Price argues\nthat it is different with primary recognition. A statement in\nresponse to a primary recognition might be erroneous, e.g., when using\nthe wrong word. But if one notices a feature presented in experience\nand has an apparent memory of encountering it earlier, then one is\nrecognising the feature, whether or not one had encountered it before.\nThis argument\u2019s two crucial assumptions are \n\n(i)\nthat the presented feature fixes what it is recognised as, and\nsince it is there, what it is recognised as cannot differ from it, and\n\n(ii)\nthe occurrence of recognition simply involves the\napparent sense of familiarity, which is there whether or not\nit has been previously encountered. \n\n\n(ii) is hard to accept.\n",
