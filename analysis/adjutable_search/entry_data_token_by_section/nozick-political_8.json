    "main_text": "The Minimal State versus Individualist Anarchism || Response to the Anarchist Challenge\n3.2 Response to the Anarchist Challenge\n\nBefore considering how and how successfully Nozick meets this\nchallenge, we need to take note of a questionable preliminary move on\nhis part. When Nozick mentions the agreements that competing agencies\nwould enter into in order to assure their prospective clients smooth\nand non-violent dispute resolution, he speaks of the emergence of\n\u201ca system of appeals courts and agreed upon rules of\njurisdiction and the conflict of laws\u201d. He acknowledges that the\nemergence of this system allows for the continued operation of\n\u201cdifferent agencies\u201d. Yet he then says that the result is\n\u201cone unified federal judicial system of which they [presumably\nthe various agencies] all are components\u201d (16). On the basis of\nthis description of the outcome of the networking process Nozick\nallows himself to speak of the rise of a dominant protective\nassociation that is united and federal.\n\nThis language seems to paper over the continued existence of\n\u201cdifferent agencies\u201d which may well compete with one\nanother not merely in terms of prices but also in terms of the\npackages of protective services they offer in response to diverse\nconsumer demand for such services. So Nozick faces a problem even if\nhe succeeds in showing that the confederation of agencies\nthat emerges from such networking may permissibly eliminate its\nnon-outlaw competitors. For, there may still be too much competition\namong the confederates that make up the dominant association\nfor it to qualify as a state (Childs 1977 and Mack 1978).\n\nPutting that initial problem aside, one possible way for Nozick to\nmeet the anarchist\u2019s challenge is to maintain that the dominant\nprotective association will eliminate its competitors without\nusing coercive force. Perhaps something about the production and\ndelivery of rights protection makes that enterprise a natural\nmonopoly. Nozick seems to be pursuing this route when he asks and\nanswers the question, \u201cWhy would a virtual monopoly arise in\nthis market without the government intervention that elsewhere creates\nand maintains it?\u201d (17). His answer is that the value of the\nprotective services offered by any agency will increase with the size\nof its clientele\u2014presumably because disputes among clients of\nthe same agency will be more cheaply or readily resolved than disputes\namong clients of competing agencies. So, clients of competing agencies\nwill migrate to the dominant association and that migration will\nincrease the incentive for yet others to follow the same\n path.[19]\n\nHowever, this claim about the propensity for \u201cvirtual\u201d\nmonopoly to arise within the rights protection business is only\nintended by Nozick to explain the emergence of a dominant protective\nassociation; it is not intended to explain that association\u2019s\npermissible suppression or control of its remaining non-outlaw\ncompetitors. Nozick accepts the anarchist contention that, for an\nagency to rise to or sustain itself as a state, it must suppress or\ncontrol actual (or potential) non-outlaw competitors. To meet the\nanarchist\u2019s challenge, Nozick sets out to show how the dominant\nassociation\u2019s suppression or control of non-outlaw competitors\nis not a violation of the rights of those competitors\u2014even\nthough they are non-outlaws.\n\nNozick\u2019s case relies upon the surprising attenuation of rights\nthat we noted in the previous section, viz., the idea that in\nthemselves rights are claims that are protected by liability rules.\nAbsent further conditions that make due compensation for infringements\nimpossible or severely difficult, rights are merely claims to be duly\ncompensated for losses imposed by certain interferences. Given this\nconstrual of rights, the basic structure of Nozick\u2019s response to\nthe anarchist is quite simple. The rights of non-outlaw protective\nagencies (and non-outlaw independent self-protectors) to engage in\ntheir chosen procedures are merely claims that are protected by\nliability rules. Hence, those procedures may be interfered with as\nlong as those subject to this interference are duly compensated. The\nanarchist is correct in saying that these non-outlaw agencies and\nindividuals have rights against being interfered with; but he is\nmistaken in thinking that these rights forbid that interference.\n\nOf course, a further premise is needed for this argument. This is that\nit will not be impossible or severely difficult to duly compensate\nthose non-outlaw agencies and individuals for interference with their\nown protective activities and, hence, their claims against such\ninterference do not acquire the force of claims protected by property\nrules. (If the claims do acquire that force, the anarchist correctly\ncondemns the dominant association\u2019s interference with those\nagencies or individuals.) To support this further premise, Nozick\nneeds to survey the conditions that do made it impossible or severely\ndifficult to supply due compensation for boundary crossings. A\nboundary will have the force of a claim protected by a property rule\nif and only if such a condition is present. Much of the intricacy (and\nopacity) of ASU\u2019s chapter 4 resides within this\nsurvey.\n\nThere are some boundary crossings\u2014like killings, maiming, or and\nlifetime enslaving\u2014for which due compensation is simply\nimpossible.\n\n\nIf some injuries are not compensable, they would not fall\nunder a policy of being allowed as long as compensation is paid.\n(Rather, they would be allowed provided compensation was paid, but\nsince the compensation could not be paid by anyone, in effect they\nwould be unallowed.) (65\u20136)\n\n\nHowever, Nozick focuses on two factors that severely complicate the\ntask of identifying due compensation for boundary crossings. The first\nis fear (65\u201371). Here is one way that fear complicates the\nidentification of due compensation. Suppose we treat the right that\neach individual has not to have her forearm broken as a claim\nprotected by a liability rule. And suppose further that we know what\nthe due compensation is for having one\u2019s forearm broken. On this\nbasis we decide to allow unconsented to forearm breaking as long as\nthe forearm breaker duly compensates the subject of his ministrations.\nThe effect of this will be to make many people fearful of having their\narms broken who will never receive compensation for that fear because\ntheir arms will not in fact be\n broken.[20]\n Or if people are to be compensated simply for their fear, individuals\nwhose conduct induces fear may be required to make compensation\npayments even though they never in fact break forearms. These sorts of\nproblems are mitigated if the right not to have one\u2019s forearm\nbroken is treated as a claim protected by a property right.\n\nThe second factor that complicates recourse to due compensation for\nunconsented to boundary crossings is the fact that the best procedure\nfor identifying the due compensation for a crossing is to require\nantecedent negotiation with and consent by the party who will be\nsubject to the crossing (63\u201365). The best way to identify the\ndue compensation for A for having her forearm broken by\nB is to see what payment A will accept to allow\nB to break her arm. However, this requires the\nprohibition of the boundary crossing under discussion unless\nthe subject of the action agrees to it. When antecedent negotiation\nbetween subject A and actor B is feasible, the best\nroute to due compensation for A (which is required under the\nliability rule construal of A\u2019s right) consists in\ntreating A\u2019s right against B\u2019s proposed\naction as a claim that is protected by a property rule. Especially\nsince antecedent negotiation between subjects and actors is usually\nfeasible, even rights that are in themselves only protected by\nliability rules are usually to be treated as boundaries that may not\nwithout consent be crossed.\n\nNozick describes the task of identifying the compensation due to\nA for undergoing B\u2019s chosen action as the task\nof identifying the just division of the benefits generated by\nB\u2019s action. B gains through his action; but\njustice requires that he share those gains with\nA\u2014especially since the immediate effect of\nB\u2019s action is a loss for A. The just division\nof the benefits is the division that A and B would\nsettle upon in conjunction with A\u2019s agreement to be\nsubject to the action in question. And the best procedure for\nidentifying what terms would be settled upon is to require antecedent\nnegotiation and consent\u2014when antecedent negotiation and consent\nis feasible.\n\nWe can now return to Nozick\u2019s core argument against the\nanarchist\u2019s challenge. Nozick calls for a three-fold distinction\namong agencies and individuals who operate outside of the dominant\nprotective association. At one end of the spectrum are outlaw agencies\nor rogue individuals who either aim to perform actions that cross\nboundaries or pose substantial risks of crossing boundaries through\ntheir recklessness or negligence. The actions of such agencies or\nindividuals may simply be suppressed to protect the rights that they\n threaten.[21]\n At the other end of the spectrum are agencies or individuals who are\nknown to the dominant association to pursue rights protection in ways\nthat are not markedly more likely to violate the rights of the\nassociation\u2019s clients than the procedures of the association is\nlikely to violate rights. Given its own procedures, the association\ncannot honestly proclaim that its clients have rights against the\nactivities of these well-behaved agencies and individuals. (But the\nassociation may know that they are well-behaved precisely through its\nmonitoring of those agencies and individuals.) In the middle of the\nspectrum are agencies and individuals whose procedures are not so\nrisky as to justify straight-forward prohibition but are risky enough\nso that those whose rights are threatened seem to have some\nrights-based justification for suppressing those procedures.\n\nAccording to Nozick, there would be no good answer to the question of\nhow the dominant association should act toward agents in the middle of\nthe spectrum if the association had to choose between straight-forward\nsuppression and securing the voluntary consent of those agents to\ncease or modify their procedures. But, fortunately, an intermediate\nmode of action is available to the dominant association, viz.,\ncrossing the boundaries that protect those unacceptably risky\nprocedures while duly compensating the subjects of those\ncrossings.\n\n\nIt might be objected that either you have the right to forbid these\npeople\u2019s risky activities or you don\u2019t. If you do, you\nneedn\u2019t compensate the people for doing to them what you have a\nright to do; and if you don\u2019t \u2026 you ought simply to stop\n[the forbidding]\u2026 . But the dilemma, \u201ceither you have a\nright to forbid it so that you needn\u2019t compensate, or you\ndon\u2019t have a right to forbid it so you should stop,\u201d is\ntoo short. It may be that you do have a right to forbid an action but\nonly provided you compensate those to whom it is forbidden. (83)\n\n\nNozick\u2019s crucial move against the anarchist depends, then, on\nconstruing the claims to non-interference of agents who engage in\nactions that pose moderate risk to others\u2019 rights as claims that\nare merely protected by liability rules. Since, they are merely\nprotected by liability rules, those actions may be interfered with as\nlong as those subject to that interference are duly compensated.\n\nWhy, though, do the rights of those who pose moderate risk to\nothers\u2019 rights not acquire the force of claims protected by\nproperty rules? With respect to the fear factor, Nozick seems simply\nto assume that the dominant association\u2019s measures to suppress\nor control the activities of those moderately dangerous (but\nnon-outlaw) agencies and individuals generate no complicating fear.\nWith respect to the division of benefits factor, Nozick seems to hold\nthat those who suppress (or mitigate) risky conduct by others should\nnot be thought of as thereby benefiting. They are essentially\nmerely diminishing the likelihood of harm being\n done.[22]\n Thus, there is no need for antecedent negotiation to determine the\njust division of the benefits generated by the dominant\nassociation\u2019s suppression or mitigation of the moderately risky\nprocedures of independent agencies or individuals. Everything else\nbeing equal, it seems to follow that moderately risky procedures by\nthose independents may be suppressed or mitigated without any\ncompensation. (Rather, it seems that they can be suppressed or\nmitigated with due compensation; but the due compensation is no\ncompensation.)\n\nHowever, according to Nozick, everything else is not quite equal. Some\nof these independent individuals or agencies may have adopted\nmoderately risky procedures because they (or their clients) cannot\nafford more fastidious procedures. According to Nozick, if we\nhad \u201ca theory of disadvantage\u201d (82), it would tell us that\nthese independents (or these clients) will be disadvantaged by the\ndominant association\u2019s interference with those moderately risky\nprocedures. They will be disadvantaged even though they are only\nengaged in (or subscribing to) procedures that might infringe\non others\u2019 rights. So, Nozick concludes, the suppression or\nmitigation of the procedures engaged in (or subscribed to) by these\nindependents must be accompanied by compensation for disadvantages\nimposed upon them. Thus, we arrive at Nozick\u2019s principle of\ncompensation:\n\n\nthose who are disadvantaged by being forbidden to do actions\nthat only might harm others must be compensated for these\ndisadvantages foisted upon them in order to provide security for the\nothers. (82\u20133)\n\n\nThis principle of compensation explains (or expresses) the\njustification for the dominant association stepping in to suppress or\nexercise mitigating control over the procedures of moderately risky\n(but non-outlaw) agencies and individuals.\n\nHow does the principle of compensation get us to the minimal state?\nAccording to Nozick, through its enforced oversight over others\u2019\nprovision of protective services the association exercises enough of a\nmonopoly over the provision of those services to become an\nultra-minimal state. However, under the principle of\ncompensation, the dominant association\u2019s interference with\nmoderately risky independents who are disadvantaged by this\ninterference will be permissible only if the association compensates\nthose independents for those disadvantages. Nozick envisions that\ncompensation naturally taking the form of the ultra-minimal state\nproviding free or subsidized protective services to those who will\n(otherwise) be disadvantaged by its interferences. When the\nultra-minimal state secures the permissibility of its monopoly\noversight by providing free or subsidized protection to those who are\n(otherwise) disadvantaged by its oversight it becomes a (legitimate)\nminimal state.\n\nIn asserting the permissibility of its enforced oversight, the\ndominant association does not maintain that it has some unique claim\nto suppress or control moderately risky agencies or individuals.\nNevertheless, by being the dominant association, it alone is in\nposition to act under the aegis of the principle of compensation\n(108\u2013110). Nozick\u2019s minimal state provides free or\nsubsidized protective services to some parties. To pay for those free\nor subsidized services, the minimal state charges its paying customers\nmore than it otherwise would. This may appear to be enforced\nredistribution; but it is not. For, the additional charges incurred by\nthe minimal state\u2019s paying clients simply are payments that are\nneeded to fund compensation that must be paid if the oversight that is\nimposed on behalf of the clients\u2019 security is to be\npermissible.\n\nNozick provides an important second argument on behalf of the dominant\nassociation\u2019s monopolistic oversight and constraint of other\nprotective agencies. This argument focuses on procedural\nrights. Do the clients of the dominant association have (natural)\nprocedural rights against having moderately risky protective measures\ndirected against them? Nozick recognizes that it seems implausible to\naffirm procedural rights in the state of nature. Yet he seeks to back\ninto such rights by starting with the proposition that even in the\nstate of nature C acts wrongly and impermissibly\ntoward D if C extracts restitution payments from\nD or punishes D without knowing (or having a\nwell-justified belief) that D has violated C\u2019s\nrights; C acts wrongly and impermissibly even if D\nhas in fact violated those rights and the restitution or punishment\nimposed by C is appropriate for that violation (106). Nozick\ntakes the wrongness and impermissibility of C\u2019s\nepistemically ill-grounded reaction to justify the prohibition of\nC\u2019s action against the guilty D. So D\nhas at least the equivalent of a procedural right against\nC\u2019s epistemically ill-grounded conduct (107). The\ndominant association can permissibly rise to statehood by enforcing\nits clients\u2019 (equivalent of) procedural rights against those\nmoderately risky\n competitors.[23]\n The problem here seems to be that, if saying that C\u2019s\nill-grounded reaction is \u201cimpermissible\u201d is merely another\nway of saying that it is morally defective, one cannot infer from its\nimpermissibility that it may be prohibited. It seems that one can only\ninfer that C\u2019s reaction may be prohibited if that\nreaction is impermissible in the much stronger sense of being\n(equivalent to) rights-violating. But one cannot assert that the\nreaction is impermissible in this stronger sense unless one already\nassumes what Nozick is purporting to show, viz., that there is a\nprocedural right (or something equivalent to such a right) that the\nill-grounded reaction violates.\n3.3 Further Observations about the Minimal State\n\nWe have already noted that Nozick\u2019s minimal state differs from\ncommon depictions of the minimal state because it does not impose\ntaxation to finance its services. In many other ways as well, it is\nmore like a business enterprise than a state. There are no rulers, no\nlegislative body, no political elections, no contending parties and\ncitizens. There is no sovereignty and no state territory. There are,\ninstead, executives, a board of directors, shareholders, clients, and\nthe assets of the enterprise. But the fly in the enterprise ointment\nis the absence of competitive market constraints on the price or the\nquality of the services offered by this monopoly. (If there is enough\nmarket competition to keep prices of protective services down and\ntheir quality up, there will be too much competition for this\nenterprise to count as a state.) It appears that the only other way to\nkeep this monopoly in check would be through some sort of\npolitical-constitutional constraints. However, Nozick makes no mention\nof these. Of course, a protective association in pursuit of customers\nmight commit itself to constitution-like constraints on its\ndecisions and conduct as a way of reassuring potential clients. (Mack\n2018 110\u2013124)\n\nIt is striking that a more direct route to a more conventional minimal\nstate\u2014i.e., one that would fund the production of rights\nprotection through taxes\u2014is available to Nozick. (Mack\n2011) That route is opened by his shift to the liability rule\nconstrual of rights. On that construal each individual\u2019s right\nto her financial assets is at base merely a right to receive due\ncompensation for the seizure of those assets. So, if the dominant\nassociation taxes individuals\u2014seizes some of their financial\nassets without their consent\u2014but provides compensating benefits\nfor each of those individuals in the form of protective services, the\nassociation\u2019s conduct will be perfectly permissible. On\nNozick\u2019s view, such non-negotiated accompanying compensation\nwill be inferior to antecedently negotiated terms of exchange if\nsuch prior negotiation would have been feasible. However, Nozick\ncould have advanced the common argument that such prior negotiation of\npayment for protective services would not be feasible.\n\nThat argument turns on the special public good feature of a system of\nrights protection, viz., that, if such a good is produced, if will be\ndifficult to exclude individuals who do not voluntarily pay for that\nsystem from enjoying (many of) the benefits generated by the system.\nPerhaps the police whom I have not voluntarily paid won\u2019t\nrespond to my calls for assistance. But they will respond to\nthe calls of my paying neighbors and, as a result, I will enjoy a\nlower level of neighborhood crime. Accordingly, antecedent\nnegotiations about payment for protection will not be feasible because\na significant number of individuals would decline to offer payment in\nthe hope that they would to get (most of) the benefits of the\nproduction of those services even if they do not contract for\n them.[24]\n Hence, assuming that the taxation to fund the public good of rights\nprotection is not itself feared, the rights to the financial assets\nthat are seized in that taxation remain claims that are merely\nprotected by liability rules. According to his argument, since the\nprovision of that protection duly compensates for the seizures, the\nimposition of those taxes is\n permissible.[25]\n\nOne strand that runs throughout ASU is Nozick\u2019s\ninterest in invisible-hand explanations\u2014explanations of complex\norders like the adjustment of supply and demand in market economies\nthat do not appeal to anyone\u2019s intention to bring about the\nexplained order (18\u201322). For Nozick, part of the charm of his\nstory about the emergence of the minimal state is that it is an\ninvisible hand story. The dominant association backs into being a\nstate without really trying (to be a state) (118\u2013119). This\ncontrasts with the visible hand quality of social contract\nexplanations or justifications of the state. Of course, no\nactual minimal state is explained or justified by\nNozick\u2019s invisible hand explanation. This is no philosophical\nproblem because there is no actual minimal state that Nozick sets out\nto justify.\n\nHowever, Nozick does seem to be committed to the view that the\nlegitimacy of any actual minimal state that might arise will depend\nupon its having arisen through permissible, rights respecting\nactivities; and this seems to be a problem. Consider a minimal state\nthat comes into existence when some aggressive individuals seize\ncontrol of a powerful coercive apparatus that has been built up\nthrough many years of murder and plunder but then immediately undergo\nconversion into conscientious libertarians. As quickly as they can\nthose individuals redirect the coercive power at their disposal from\naggressions against life, liberty, and property to the suppression of\nrights violations by non-violating means. It seems that our judgment\nabout the legitimacy of this minimal state should turn at least\nprimarily on how it now conducts itself and not on the\nimpermissibility of the actions through which this state was founded\n(Paul 1979).\n\nA new angle on this topic is presented in Ralf Bader\u2019s ingenious\nexplanation of how Nozick\u2019s account of the way in which minimal\nstates would arise without violating rights supports a demand\nin justice that actual more-than-minimal states be transformed into\nminimal states. (Bader 2017) The key is Bader\u2019s idea that the\nrectification of economic injustice and the rectification of (what\nmight be called) political justice are isomorphic. Economic\nrectification requires the transition from an array of holdings that\nis at least in part the product of rights violations to the array of\nholdings that would have arisen had holdings arisen justly.\nIn parallel fashion, political rectification requires the transition\nfrom political institutions that are at least in part the product of\nrights violations to the political institutions that would\nhave arisen had political institutions arisen justly. Nozick\u2019s\ncounterfactual account of the minimal state reveals that this is sort\nof political institution into which actual more-than-minimal states\nmust, as a matter of justice, be transformed.\n4. Justice in Holdings\n\nWhile the core official purpose of Part I of ASU is the\ndefense of the minimal state against the anarchist critique, the core\nofficial purpose of Part II of ASU, is to argue that\n\u201cno more extensive state can be justified\u201d (xi). In\nchapter 8 of Part II, \u201cEquality, Envy, Exploitation,\nEtc.\u201d, Nozick seeks to counter the force of a series of\nconsiderations that are invoked on behalf of a more extensive state.\nThese include equality, equal opportunity, meaningful work,\nworkers\u2019 control, and exploitation. In chapter 9 of part II,\n\u201cDemoktesis\u201d, he constructs an invisible hand account of\nthe rise of an unconstrained democratic state. The intention seems to\nbe to undercut the appeal of such a state by showing what sorts of\nunattractive, albeit permissible, actions individuals would have to\nengage in to arrive at such a state. Nozick needs, then, to explain\nwhy a hypothetical invisible hand explanation of the minimal state\nmuch more legitimates it than a hypothetical invisible hand\nexplanation of the unconstrained democratic state legitimates it\n(292\u2013294).\n\nStill, by far the most philosophically important chapter of Part II is\nchapter 7, \u201cDistributive Justice\u201d in which Nozick seeks to\ncounter the view that a more extensive state is justified as an\ninstrument of distributive justice. This chapter has been the subject\nof the bulk of the philosophical commentary on ASU. In this\nchapter, Nozick sketches his \u201chistorical entitlement\u201d\nconception of justice in holdings, provides a number of quite general\narguments against all alternative conceptions of justice in holdings,\nendorses a Lockean Proviso that adds a bit of complexity to the\nentitlement doctrine, and provides a powerful critique of Rawls\u2019\ncase in A Theory of Justice for his strongly redistributive\n\u201cdifference principle\u201d. This section focuses on the first\nthree of these topics.\n4.1 The Historical Entitlement Doctrine about Justice in Holdings\n\nNozick\u2019s approach to justice in holdings has to be seen as\nemerging from his broad construal of the implications of the\nRawlsian-Nozickean critique of utilitarianism. Whereas Rawls concludes\nthat a due respect for the separateness of persons precludes imposing\nlosses on individuals for the sake of the general welfare, Nozick\nconcludes that it precludes imposing losses upon individuals for the\nsake of any conception of the overall social\ngood\u2014including deeply distribution-sensitive conceptions. The\njustice of a given individual\u2019s possession of and discretionary\ncontrol over certain economic goods cannot be a function of that\npossession and control contributing to the general welfare or\nto any other overall social end-state or pattern. All such\nconsequentialist assessments of holdings are ruled out of court. So,\nif there is any acceptable account of the justice of individual\nholdings, it must be a backward-looking account. The justification\nmust depend upon how the holdings in question have arisen.\n\nIf the holding came about by permissible and title-conferring modes of\naction, the possessor will be entitled to it. If the holding came\nabout by modes of action that are not permissible (or are permissible\nbut not title-conferring) the possessor will not be entitled to it.\nThus, entitlements are historical. Individual A will have an\nentitlement to holding H if and only if A\u2019s\npossession of H has the right sort of history. This stance\naccords with the common-sense intuition that an agent\u2019s\nacquiring economically valuable objects in certain ways\u2014e.g.,\ncreating those objects out of unowned natural\nmaterials\u2014generates entitlements for that agent over those\nobjects while an agent\u2019s acquiring objects in other\nways\u2014e.g., seizing those objects from another who has created\nthem out of unowned natural materials\u2014does not generate\nentitlements for that agent over those objects. A distribution of\nholdings across individuals will be just insofar as the particular\nholdings that constitute that distribution are just\u2014rather than\nthe justice of any particular individual\u2019s holding depending on\nthe holistic justice of the distribution of which it is a part.\n\nJust acquisition takes the form of just initial acquisition, just\ntransfer, or just rectification of an unjust taking. An existing\nholding will be just if it arises from an act of just initial\nacquisition or an act of just initial acquisition followed by one or\nmore acts of just transfer, or an act of just rectification that\ncounteracts an unjust taking of a just holding. An adequate theory of\njustice in holdings will specify the processes that constitute just\ninitial acquisitions, just transfers, and just acts of rectification.\nNozick tells us that each of these principles is a \u201ccomplicated\ntruth\u201d (150) that he will not attempt to formulate. Thus, we\nnever get statements from Nozick of what specific initial acquisition\nor transfer or rectification processes that result in agent\nC\u2019s possession of H generate or convey to\nC an entitlement over H. Nozick never directly seeks\nto explain why certain specific processes\u2014certain specific means\nof acquisition\u2014have the power to generate or convey\nentitlements. He never addresses the ways in which historical\ncontingency and convention may select (from among morally eligible\nprocedures) the specific procedures that count as entitlement\nconferring within a given society. (Mack 2010 and Bryan 2017)\n\nNozick\u2019s lack of specification and explanation has mislead\ncommentators such as Cohen into thinking that, for Nozick, any not\nunjust process that results in C\u2019s possession of\nH generates or conveys an entitlement for C over\nH. \u201c\u2019[J]ust steps, for Nozick, are human actions\nthat are free of injustice\u2026\u201d (Cohen 1995: 39). Consider\nCohen\u2019s example of D\u2019s rolling pin accidentally\nrolling downhill from D\u2019s kitchen into\nC\u2019s kitchen where C innocently mistakes it for\nhis long-lost rolling pin. Cohen thinks that, since nothing within\nthis transfer process is unjust, Nozick is committed to the transfer\nbeing just and entitlement conveying and, hence, is committed to the\nimplausible conclusion that C would acquire a just claim to\nthe rolling pin. Although this sort of criticism rests on the mistaken\nidea that, for Nozick, just processes are simply not unjust processes,\nit does highlight how little Nozick does offer in the way of a\npositive account of the nature and power of entitlement generating or\nconveying processes.\n\nNozick thinks we are pushed to adopt some set of historical\nentitlement principles by the dethronement of consequentialist\ndoctrines of justice in holdings; and he then implicitly relies on his\nreaders\u2019 intuitions about what the content of those principles\nwill be. Such intuitions will, e.g., count against the thought that\none can engage in the initial just acquisition of H by\nwanting H or by intensely focusing one\u2019s attention on\nH and will support the thought that some sort of physical\nengagement with unowned materials is necessary for acquiring an\nentitlement to them. Similarly, such intuitions will count against the\nthought that an accidental transfer of a rolling pin from\nD\u2019s kitchen to C\u2019s kitchen will convey\nthe right to the pin from D to C and will support\nthe thought that such a conveyance requires some sort of informed and\nvoluntary interaction between D and C.\n4.2 The Critique of End-State and Patterned Principles\n\nNozick discerns two types of principles concerning justice in holdings\nother than the historical entitlement type. These are end-state\nprinciples and patterned principles. To a considerable extent,\nNozick\u2019s argument on behalf of his historical entitlement\napproach consists in his critiques of end-state and patterned\ndoctrines. End-state principles hold that justice in the distribution\nof income (or economically valuable goods) is a matter of some\narithmetical feature of one of the available distributions. Consider\nthree available distributions of income among three individuals (or\namong three positions to be occupied by individuals):\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA\nB\nC \n\nDistribution D1\n12\n10\n9 \n\nDistribution D2\n4\n22\n13 \n\nDistribution D3\n20\n8\n8  \n\n\nA utilitarian (or income maximization) theory will select\nD2 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nhas the greatest total income. An egalitarian theory will select\nD1 as the just distribution on the ground that it\nis the most equal distribution. Rawls\u2019 difference principle will\nselect D1 on the distinct ground that within it\nthe lowest payoff is greater than the lowest payoff within any other\navailable distribution. What makes each of these doctrines an\nend-state view is their shared conviction that the information\nprovided by this sort of matrix is sufficient for determining which of\nthe available distributions is the just one.\n\nAccording to Nozick, a major problem for all end-state doctrines is\nprecisely the falsity of this shared conviction. For surely\ninformation that cannot appear within such a matrix is essential to a\nsensible judgment about which of these available distributions is\njust. Consider, e.g., the following information.\nD2 is the distribution of income that obtains when\nA is enslaved to B who employs C as his\neffective overseer. D1 is the distribution that\nobtains when A is partially emancipated and is only subject\nto slavery-like exploitation by B and C one week per\nmonth. And D3 is the distribution that obtains\nwhen A is entirely emancipated. Given the obvious relevance\nof this sort of information for any responsible selection of one of\nthese distributions as the just one, any doctrine that asserts or\npresumes that the information available in the matrix suffices has to\nbe deeply flawed.\n\nPatterned theories of distributive justice escape this problem because\nthey hold that the just distribution is the available distribution in\nwhich the income accorded to individuals most tracks some feature of\nthose individuals\u2014e.g., their moral desert or their economic\neffort\u2014and the incidence of that feature is not reported in that\nincome matrix. Hence, one cannot say which of the distributions\npresented in the above table is to be selected until one also knows\nwhat the distribution of the to-be-tracked feature is among\nA, B, and C. In addition, plausible\npatterned doctrines will focus on features of individuals that are\nhistorical\u2014e.g., how much moral desert particular individuals\nhave amassed or how much economic effort they have evinced. So,\nplausible patterned doctrines will be historical. However, unlike\nhistorical entitlement doctrines, historical patterned theories will\nnot determine the justice of the particular holdings of individuals on\nthe basis of whether those individuals acquired those holdings through\nentitlement generating or conveying processes.\n\nNozick offers a series of arguments each of which is supposed to\ndiscredit all (non-trivial) end-state and patterned principles. (At\nthis point, Nozick employs the term \u201cpatterned\u201d to refer\nboth to end-state principles and track-the-feature principles.) We\nmust focus here on two of those arguments. The first, most famous, and\nmost misunderstood of these arguments appears in the section of\nASU that is entitled \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d (160\u2013164). The second appears in the section\nentitled \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d\n(167\u2013174).\n\nIn \u201cHow Liberty Upsets Patterns\u201d, Nozick asks each of his\nreaders to envision an income distribution that accords with her\nfavorite patterning principle. Then Nozick points out that more or\nless as soon as that pattern P1 is instituted,\nindividuals will engage in highly innocuous dispositions of what has\nbeen assigned to them in the name of justice that will engender a\ndifferent pattern P2. For instance, a million fans\nwill each pay Wilt Chamberlain 25 cents to see him play basketball.\nHowever, this new pattern P2 will almost certainly\nbe convertible through fine-tuned social engineering into another\npattern P3 that better realizes the favored\npatterning principle. Imagine, e.g., that the $250,000 that is\nconcentrated in Wilt\u2019s hands within P2 can\nbe effectively redistributed downward whereas it could not be\neffectively redistributed downward when it was still spread out among\nWilt\u2019s moderately prosperous fans. Thus, if we continue to\nassess distributions on the basis of the selected patterning\nprinciple, we will have to declare P2 to be unjust\nand maintain that justice requires its conversion into\nP3. And, more or less as soon as\nP3 is instituted, individuals will engage in\nhighly innocuous dispositions of what has just been assigned to them\nin the name of renewed justice that will engender a different pattern\nP4 \u2026 and so on. Nozick then identified two\nproblems with this continued application of the favored patterned\nrule.\n\nThis first problem is that, if (as stipulated) the holdings of\nindividuals under P1 were just and if (as\nstipulated) interactions that converted P1 into\nP2 were all just, it is difficult to see how\nP2 can become infected with injustice. Of course,\nP2 (almost certainly) must be judged to\nbe unjust if one continues to assess the justice of distributions on\nthe basis of the adopted patterned principle. But it seems reasonable\nto demand an explanation of how that asserted injustice could\nhave entered P2 given the justice of\nP1 and of the processes through which\nP2 emerges from P1.\n\n\nBy what process could such a transfer among two persons give rise to a\nlegitimate claim of distributive justice on a portion of what was\ntransferred, by a third party who has no claim of justice on any\nholding of the others before the transfer? (161\u20132)\n\n\nIt does not seem to be a sufficient answer to say that injustice must\nhave entered in P2 because, after all, when we\napply the operative distributive principle to P2\nwe reach the conclusion that P2 is unjust.\n\nThe second problem is that the endorsement of redistributive\ninterference with the outcomes of persons\u2019 innocuous deployments\nof their assigned holdings seems to be inconsistent with the justice\nof that assignment of holdings. For surely one may dispose as one\nchooses of one\u2019s just holdings as long as one does not unjustly\nimpinge upon others and their just holdings.\n\n\nIf the people were entitled to dispose of the resources to which they\nwere entitled (under D1), didn\u2019t this\ninclude their being entitled to give it to, or exchange it with Wilt\nChamberlain? (161)\n\n\nTo endorse redistributive interference with the outcomes of\npersons\u2019 non-impinging dispositions of the holdings that have\nbeen assigned to them seems to rescind the justice of that assignment\nof holdings.\n\n\nPatterned distributional principles do not give people what\nentitlement principles do, only better distributed. They do not give\nthe right to choose what to do with what one has\u2026 (167)\n\n\nThis aspect of Nozick\u2019s critique is nicely summed up in Hillel\nSteiner\u2019s quip that patterned theories of justice \u201ccreate\nrights to interfere with the rights that they have created\u201d\n(Steiner 1977:\n 43).[26]\n\nIt is important to note that the problems that Nozick\u2019s\nidentifies are problems internal to the ongoing application\nof any patterned principle. Nozick should not be read as making the\nquestion-begging external argument that, since conforming to liberty\nis the standard by which theories of justice in holdings should be\nassessed and patterned theories often call for interferences with\nliberty, patterned theories must be dismissed. Nevertheless, Nozick\nbears considerable responsibility for this reading when he says,\n\n\nThe general point\u2026 is that no end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continually\nrealized without continuous interference with people\u2019s lives.\n(163)\n\n\nNor should Nozick be pictured as holding that the problem with\npatterned theories is that they would forbid any departure from a\nP1 that is instituted because, at the time it is\ninstituted, it is the available distribution that best realizes some\nfavored pattern. Nozick is not charging patterning theorists with\nforbidding the exchange between Wilt and his fans.\n\nAn important response to Nozick\u2019s \u201cHow Liberty Upsets\nPatterns\u201d arguments is that they rely upon a mistaken picture of\nthe patterned theorist\u2019s program. According to this response,\nNozick represents the patterned theorist as aiming at the daily (or\nweekly or monthly) fullest available realization of her favorite\npattern. On this representation, at the end of each day (or week or\nmonth) the advocate of, e.g., the Rawlsian difference principle will\ndetermine whether the existing distribution can be transformed into\none that provides a higher income for those in the lowest income\npositions for the next day (or week or month); if such a\ntransformation is available then (on this representation) the\ndifference principle advocate will require it as a matter of justice.\nHence, the continuous interference in the name of justice with the\nresults of people acting as they choose with their purported just\nholdings. However, the advocate of the difference principle will\nmaintain that this principle guides the design of the basic\ninstitutional structure of society; it provides the basic structure\nwith the aim of raising the lifetime income of the representative\nlowest income individual as much as possible. What is assigned to\nindividuals as a matter of distributive justice is a lifetime stream\nof income that arises through some combination of permitted and\nprotected modes of income acquisition, tax and regulatory structures,\nand tax-funded assistance. Wilt does not have a claim in justice to\nhis holdings on the day before the fans transfer $250,000 to him or to\nhis holdings on the following day. He has a claim in justice to the\nlifetime income that will accrue to him when a basic structure is in\nplace which, through enabling income acquisition, taxing, regulating,\nand subsidizing income yields (something like) the highest possible\nlifetime income for the least advantaged. That claim in justice is not\nviolated when the IRS seizes, say, 70% of his $250,000 windfall.\n\nHence, in his most direct response to Nozick\u2019s challenge, Rawls\ndeclares,\n\n\nThere are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences with\ncitizens\u2019 expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are\nearned, and honored as the public system declares. Taxes and\nrestrictions are all in principle foreseeable, and holdings\nare acquired on the known condition that certain transfers\nand redistributions will be made. (Rawls 1993: 283, emphasis\nadded)\n\n\nIt would seem, however, that Nozick can insist that any ongoing\nattempt to maximize lifetime incomes for the worst off (or to sustain\nany other non-trivial pattern) will require unannounced and\nunpredictable interferences with citizens\u2019 expectations and\nacquisitions. For, as economic preferences, needs, opportunities,\nbeliefs, insights, and capacities change in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways, the public system will similarly have to change if\nit is going to continue to aim at maximizing lifetime incomes for the\nworst off. And as further unannounced and unpredictable changes occur,\nthe basic structure will again have to be changed in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways. As Rawls himself says, \u201c\u2026 even in a\nwell-ordered society, adjustments in the basic structure are always\nnecessary\u201d (Rawls 1993: 284, Mack 2018: 124\u2013129). The\ninstitution of those adjustments will almost certainly have to\ndishonor some of the entitlements proclaimed under the previous public\nsystem and treat some of people\u2019s previously earned holdings to\npreviously unannounced and unpredictable transfers and redistributions\n(Mack 2002a, 85\u201391).\n\nIn \u201cRedistribution and Property Rights\u201d Nozick offers a\nmore external argument against all patterned theories of justice. The\nargument is that the institutional operation of any (non-trivial)\npatterned doctrine amounts to the institution of partial ownership of\nsome people by other people.\n\n\nWhether it is done through taxation on wages or on wages over a\ncertain amount, or through seizure of profits, or through there being\na big social pot so that it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s coming from\nwhere and what\u2019s going where, patterned principles of\ndistributive justice involve appropriating the actions of other\npersons. Seizing the results of someone\u2019s labor is equivalent to\nseizing hours from him and directing him to carry on various\nactivities\u2026 . This process \u2026 makes [those who carry it\nout] a part-owner of you; it gives them a property right in you. Just\nas having such partial control and power of decision, by right, over\nan animal or inanimate object would be to have a property right in it.\n(172)\n\n\nNozick distances himself from a Lockean labor-mixing account of just\ninitial holdings by jokingly asking whether one comes to own the ocean\nby pouring one\u2019s can of tomato juice into it (175). And, in the\npassage above, he carefully avoids saying that the operation of any\npatterned doctrine infringes upon one\u2019s self-ownership by way of\nappropriating one\u2019s labor.\n\nNevertheless, the argument in this passage seems to be quite Lockean\nin its basic structure. Rather than focusing on particular\nexpropriations of this or that labor infused object, the argument\nattends to the configuration of control over individuals\u2019\nactions, time, and decisions that the institution of any (non-trivial)\ndistributive pattern will require. According to Nozick, such a\nconfiguration of control wrongly treats the individuals who are\nsubject to it without their consent as though they are in part the\nproperty of those who establish and exercise that control. Note that\neven here Nozick does not seem to be proposing specific content for\nthe principles of just initial acquisition and just transfer. Rather,\nthe goal is to provide a general vindication of the historical\nentitlement approach by undercutting the end-state and patterned\napproaches.\n4.3 Nozick\u2019s Lockean Proviso\n\nNozick follows Locke in adopting a version of the claim that an\nindividual will have a complaint in justice against otherwise\nperfectly just acquisitions by others if those acquisitions do not\nleave that individual with \u201cenough, and as good\u201d\n(174\u2013182). Although Nozick\u2019s discussion of his Lockean\nproviso is somewhat murky, we can identify three important features of\nthat proviso doctrine.\n\nFirst, whether an individual has a complaint under Nozick\u2019s\nLockean proviso will not be a matter of whether too little natural\nmaterial has been left in common by others or too little material has\nbeen left for that individual to initially acquire. Rather, that\nindividual will have a just complaint against others\u2019\nacquisitions if and only if those acquisitions leave her on net worse\noff in terms of utility or welfare. The individual will have no just\ncomplaint even if her utility or welfare is diminished by a decrease\nin what remains in common or a decrease in what remains available for\nher initial acquisition as long as she is duly compensated in terms of\nutility or welfare by other effects of the acquisitive\nactions of others. The claim at the core of Nozick\u2019s\n\u201cenough, and as good\u201d proviso is only protected by a\nliability rule.\n\nSecond, in his main discussion of it, Nozick maintains that this\nproviso is readily satisfied in free market\n economies.[27]\n This is in part due to the strong tendency of the rising tide of such\neconomies to raise up all those who are willing to swim with it (177).\nIt is also in part due to the low baseline set by the proviso. Nozick\nnever carefully spells out that baseline. But it must be something\nlike how well off the individual under consideration would have been\nhad all natural stuff remained in the common or, perhaps, how well off\nthat individual would be (over his lifetime) were all natural stuff\n(or even all owned stuff) now returned to the common.\n\nThird, the proviso adds \u201can additional bit of complexity into\nthe structure of the entitlement theory\u201d (174). It specifies a\nway in which things could go especially badly for an individual even\nif the acquisitions of others are entirely in accord with the\nprinciples of justice in acquisition and it asserts that individuals\nwould have a complaint in justice should things go that badly for them\nin that way. For Nozick, the primary case for the justice of any\nholding continues to turn on its having arisen through processes that\naccord with the principles of just initial acquisition, just transfer,\nand (if relevant) just rectification. (This is why it is such a\nserious problem that Nozick never spells out those principles and\nnever explains why acquisition in accordance with them has the power\nto engender or convey entitlements.) For Nozick, even if the proviso\nis violated, those who have acquired justly do not have to surrender\ntheir holdings\u2014albeit they need to provide compensation to those\nwhose situations are on net worsened by the existing system of\n holdings.[28]\n4.4 The Rectification of Historical Injustices\n\nNozick recognizes that even in relatively free societies the\nhistorical processes that have yielded existing holdings have been\nshot through with injustices. The history of almost all existing\nholdings includes lots of appropriation by way of murder, plunder,\nenslavement, fraudulent dealings, and other illicit coercive transfers\n(usually on behalf of the rich and powerful). We do not need a\ndelicately worked out theory of rectification in order to say that, if\nA has grabbed B\u2019s goat yesterday, he can be\nrequired to return it to B today. But we do need a highly\nelaborate theory to inform us about what rectification payments (if\nany) should now be required of whom on behalf of who else because of\ninjustices performed 20 or 50 or 200 years ago. Presumably any\nacceptable doctrine will require that only current victims of past\ninjustices have just claims to rectification payments and that they\nonly have just claims against current beneficiaries of those past\ninjustices. Perhaps, then, bygones should be treated as bygones when\nwe lack the information that a well-developed doctrine of\nrectification would require us to have to justly rectify long past\n injustices.[29]\n\nNozick closes chapter 7 with two thoughts concerning rectification.\nThe first is that proper rectification may have to take the form of\nrough and ready payments to classes of people whose members are likely\nto be worse off than they otherwise would be because of historical\ninjustices\u2014payments that would be funded by taxes upon classes\nof people whose members are likely to be better off than they\notherwise would be because of those historical injustices. The second\nis that some end-state principle might come into play as a guide for\nthese required payments\u2014albeit \u201cit may well be\nimplausible\u201d (231) to select the difference principle as this\nguide.\n5. Utopia\n\nThe official purpose of Part III of ASU,\n\u201cUtopia\u201d, is to show that the minimal state is not merely\nlegitimate and just; it is also inspiring. This purpose is advanced by\nsketching a framework for utopia that is inspiring and noting that\nthis framework is highly akin to\u2014Nozick actually says\n\u201cequivalent to\u201d (333)\u2014the minimal state. Yet Nozick\nalso says that the framework might not have any \u201ccentral\nauthority\u201d (329). Still, the framework is akin to the minimal\nstate because it is an institutional structure that enforces peaceful\nco-existence among voluntarily formed communities. It protects the\nindependence of such communities and their freedom to recruit members\nand also protects the liberty of individuals to enter and exit\ncommunities as they respectively choose. Although Nozick is not\nexplicit about this, we have to presume that the framework enforces\nthe same norms of personal freedom, property, and contractual\ncompliance that the minimal state enforces except insofar as\nindividuals voluntarily relinquish such rights within the communities\nthey enter.\n\nThe framework is inspiring because of the way it contributes to\npersons\u2019 identification of and participation in communities (and\nother networks of relationships) through which they will find meaning\nand well-being. It is inspiring to anyone who appreciates how little\neach of us knows about what sorts of communities best suit human\nbeings in all their depth and diversity and how much the operation of\nthe framework assists individuals in their discovery of and engagement\nin communities that enhance their respective well-being. Moreover,\nmany persons may value the framework not merely for the way it\nenhances their own good but, also, for the ways in which it allows\nthem to participate vicariously in others\u2019 achievement of their\ndifferent modes of flourishing (Lomasky 2002).\n5.1 The Framework as Discovery Procedure\n\nThe framework is\u2014or, more precisely, sustains\u2014a discovery\nprocedure. Under the protective umbrella of the framework, individuals\nare presented with and can try out diverse communities while\ncommunities themselves arise and modify themselves in their\ncompetitive search to sustain, improve, or increase their membership.\nA wide range of communities will continually arise out of and in\nresponse to the evolving perceptions that diverse individuals will\nhave about what modes of sociality will best suit them and will best\nattract welcome partners. Communities will survive and perhaps expand\nor be imitated insofar as they actually embody modes of relationship\nthat serve well their actual or prospective membership or insofar as\nthey successfully refine their offerings in the market place of\ncommunities. The framework also insures that those who are already\nconfident that they know what sort of community is best for them will\nbe free to form those communities by voluntary subscription and,\nthereby, to manifest their actual value (or disvalue) to themselves\nand to other seekers of well-being.\n\nPart of Nozick\u2019s sub-text here is a message to socialist\nutopians that nothing in the framework (or the minimal state)\nprecludes their non-coercive pursuit of their ideal communities. How,\ntherefore, can socialists object to the framework (or the minimal\nstate)? This generalizes Nozick\u2019s earlier claims in ASU\nthat that advocates of meaningful work and workers\u2019 control of\nproductive enterprises ought not to be hostile to the minimal state\nsince the minimal state is fully tolerant of non-coercive endeavors to\nestablish such conditions (246\u2013253).\n\nIn a short essay in Reason magazine published four years\nafter ASU, Nozick asked, \u201cWho Would Choose\nSocialism?\u201d (Nozick 1978). More precisely, his question was:\nWhat percent of the adult population would choose \u201cto\nparticipate in socialist interpersonal relations of equality and\ncommunity\u201d were they in position to choose between \u201ca\nreasonably attractive socialist option and also a reasonably\nattractive non-socialist one?\u201d (Nozick 1978: 277). Nozick takes\nthe choice available to Israelis between membership and non-membership\nin kibbutzim to be a good instance of a choice between such options\nand notes that around six percent of the adult population of Israel in\nthe 1970s had chosen the socialist option. He speculates that\nsocialists are at least \u201ctempted\u201d to be imperialists,\ni.e., to impose on everyone one their own vision of utopia, precisely\nbecause they sense that there will be too few volunteers (Nozick 1978:\n279).\n\nThe discovery procedure that the framework sustains is a version of\nMillian experiments in living\u2014albeit it is a version that places\nmuch more emphasis on the role of a marketplace of communities in\nproviding individuals with experimental options. This discovery\nprocedure (like Millian experiments in living) is, of course, a\nHayekian invisible hand process. Given the enormous diversity among\nindividuals, we do not know what one form of community would be\nbest.\n\n\nThe idea that there is one best composite answer to all of these\nquestions [about what features utopia has], one best society for\neveryone to live in, seems to me to be an incredible one. (And the\nidea that, if there is one, we now know enough to describe it is even\nmore incredible.) (311)\n\n\nNor do we know what distinct modes of community would be best for\ndistinct types of persons. Thus, we cannot design an inclusive utopia;\nnor can we design an array of mini-utopia such that some significantly\nfulfilling community will be available to everyone\u2014or even to\nmost.\n\n\nIt is helpful to imagine cavemen sitting together to think up what,\nfor all time, will be the best possible society and then setting out\nto institute it. Do none of the reasons that make you smile at this\napply to us? (313\u2013314)\n\n\nGiven our ignorance, the best way to realize utopia\u2014almost\ncertainly many distinct utopia\u2014is through the discovery\nprocedure that the framework sustains. (We should note, however, an\nimplicit, somewhat puzzling, and wholly unnecessary presupposition of\nNozick\u2019s discussion, viz, that individuals with utopian\naspirations will generally seek out communities that are made up of\nother individuals like themselves. The suggestion is that chosen\ncommunities will be internally homogeneous with heterogeneity existing\nonly across these communities.)\n5.2. An Independent Route to the Minimal State\n\nThe role of the framework in sustaining a discovery procedure brings\nus to the second main purpose of \u201cUtopia\u201d. This is the\nprovision of an independent vindication of the minimal state\u2014one\nthat specifically does not depend on \u201cthe moral arguments for\nindividual liberty\u201d (309 footnote*) offered in Parts I and II of\nAnarchy, State, and Utopia. Although the activities of the\nframework are described in terms of protecting the rights that are\naffirmed in early parts of the book, the utopian advocacy of the\nframework does not rely upon the validity of those rights. Rather,\nthat advocacy turns on a general endorsement of utopian aspiration\ncombined with the core epistemic claim that, given our ignorance, the\nonly sensible route to utopia is the discovery procedure that the\nframework sustains.\n\nThere is, however, an apparent problem with Nozick\u2019s\nindependence claim. Nozick distinguishes among three sorts of\nutopians. There are \u201cexistential utopians\u201d who have a\nparticular utopia in mind for themselves and others who will be drawn\nto it but have no problem with yet others being drawn to different\nutopia. There are \u201cmissionary utopians\u201d who hope \u201cto\npersuade or convince everyone to live in one particular kind of\ncommunity, but will not force them to do so\u201d. And there are\n\u201cimperialistic utopians\u201d who countenance \u201cthe\nforcing of everyone into one pattern of community\u201d\n(319\u2013320). While existential utopians will embrace the framework\nand missionary utopians will (less heartily) support it, imperialistic\n\u201cwill oppose the framework as long as some others do not agree\nwith them\u201d (320). Nozick\u2019s response to the imperialist is\nto say \u201cWell you can\u2019t satisfy everyone, especially if\nthere are those who will be dissatisfied unless not everybody is\nsatisfied\u201d (320). The suggestion\u2014never explicitly stated\nby Nozick\u2014is that the imperialist pursuit of utopia is to be\nsuppressed by the framework precisely because it is\nimpermissibly coercive. But, if so, the justification for\nthis crucial operation of the framework must appeal to some of\n\u201cthe moral arguments for individual liberty\u201d from which\nNozick wants his utopia argument to be independent.\n\nHowever, Nozick may be able to escape from this problem by emphasizing\nthat imperialists are being excluded on epistemic rather than moral\ngrounds. The question is, on what procedures will epistemically\nsensible utopians\u2014utopians with a due appreciation for the\ndifficulties involved in identifying and instituting\nutopia\u2014converge? And the answer is, on the processes of\nvoluntary association and dissociation and adjustment that the\nframework aims to sustain. Imperialist utopian coercion is simply not\npart of the process that all utopians have reason to favor because of\nits epistemic fecundity. Moreover, the operation of the framework does\nnot preclude the establishment\u2014for some people or for\nall\u2014of the mode of community favored by any\nutopian.\n\n\nSince any particular community may be established within the\nframework, it is compatible with all particular utopian visions, while\nguaranteeing none. (320)\n\n\nAny utopian who wants her (current) vision to be guaranteed by being\nforced upon others has good epistemic reasons to shed that desire.\n\nStill, it might be maintained that the most informative discovery\nprocedure is one that embodies no-holds-barred competition among\ncommunities. For surely we want to know which communities or\nassociations of communities, if any, will be capable of defending\nthemselves against the imperialists. Since it seems that the most\ninformative discovery procedure would not exclude imperialist\nutopians, it seems that the real basis for the exclusion of\nimperialists must be moral. Hence, it appears that their exclusion\ndoes undercut Nozick\u2019s goal of providing an independent\nvindication of the minimal state.\n\nHowever, this problem also may be just a matter of appearance. After\nall, the framework proposed by Nozick does not exclude imperialists in\nthe sense of stipulating their non-existence. Rather, one of the core\nroles of the framework is precisely to protect non-imperialists and\ntheir voluntary modes of association and dissociation from those\nepistemically short-sighted, albeit still existing, imperialists. The\noperation of the framework should, therefore, be seen as a two-level\ndiscovery procedure. On one level it operates as Nozick explicitly\ndescribes\u2014as a competitive market place of communities serving\nindividuals who are becoming more informed about their taste for\ncommunity. However, on another level, the operation of the framework\nis a procedure through which non-imperialist communities and\nnon-imperialist individuals who do not enter any utopian community\ndiscover how, if at all, they can cooperate in maintaining and\noperating the framework so as to protect themselves and their\nepistemic quest from the imperialists.",
