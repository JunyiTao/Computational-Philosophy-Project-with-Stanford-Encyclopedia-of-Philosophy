    "main_text": "Individual Responsibility and Health Behaviors\n8. Justice and Global Health Inequalities\n\nDiscussions of justice and health inequality often focus on\ninequalities among members of the same polity. However, scholars have\nalso addressed the justice of international health disparities, which,\ndepending on the countries of comparison, can be drastic. As we note\nabove, life expectancy in low-income countries in 2016 was 62.7 years,\ncompared to 80.8 years in high-income countries, a gap of 18.1 years\n(WHO 2020). These disparities are no doubt driven by the wide income\ndifferences among these countries, and so questions regarding their\njustice are tightly connected to questions of global distributive\njustice (see entries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n global justice).\n However, global health inequalities are also driven by war, climate\nchange, healthcare worker migration, and the funding decisions of\nsponsors of medical research, among other factors. Positions regarding\nthe justice of global health disparities may therefore have\nfar-reaching implications for a diverse set of policy spheres.\n\nGiven the tight connection between global health justice and global\ndistributive justice, it is no surprise that approaches to the former\npiggy-back on approaches to the latter. Briefly,\ncosmopolitans start from the premise that all humans are\nmoral equals and argue on this basis that high-income states have\nrobust distributive obligations to people regardless of their\nnationality or relation to them. Some cosmopolitans defend a\nsufficientarian position (Brock 2009), while others argue that global\njustice demands equality since national membership is a morally\narbitrary factor on the basis of which people should not be\ndisadvantaged (Caney 2005). Institutionalists do not reject\nthe claim that all humans are moral equals but argue that robust\ndistributive obligations\u2014as opposed to a duty of\nassistance\u2014are contingent on the existence of certain types of\ninstitutions, whether a coercive legal system (Nagel 2005; Blake 2001)\nor institutions establishing substantial economic interdependence\n(Sangiovanni 2007; J. Cohen & Sabel 2006).\n\nTurning to theories of global health justice, a number of scholars\ndefend sufficientarian accounts, according to which all people are\nentitled to some minimum level of health or opportunity to be healthy.\nSridhar Venkatapuram (2011: 224) defends a cosmopolitan account of\nglobal health justice according to which all people have an\nentitlement to the capability to be healthy, secured at a threshold\nsufficient to ensure their equal human dignity. Jennifer Prah Ruger\n(2018: 82) defends an institutionalist sufficientarian approach,\n\u201cprovincial globalism\u201d, according to which states and the\nbroader global community have an obligation to ensure that all people\nenjoy a threshold level of central health capabilities. Others defend\nthe human right to health, understood as a right to \u201cprotection\nagainst \u2018standard threats\u2019 to health\u201d (Wolff 2012:\n27), or as a right to those things necessary for a basic minimum of\nhealth and so for a minimally good life (Hassoun 2020; see also Powers\n& Faden 2006: 85).\n\nSegall (2010) defends a cosmopolitan luck prioritarian account of\nglobal health justice. National membership is a morally arbitrary\nfeature of one\u2019s identity, Segall argues, and so disadvantages\nin people\u2019s opportunities for health that are due to national\nmembership should be addressed, with priority given to those who are\nworse off. While luck egalitarian or prioritarian positions often\npermit deficits in health due to voluntary choices in the domestic\ncontext, Segall (2010) rejects appeals to national responsibility to\njustify global health disparities on the grounds that not all\nresidents of a polity can be held responsible for national policies.\nEven in an ideal world of democratic countries operating in the\ncontext of a just global economic order, policy decisions will be made\non behalf of children and against the wishes of dissenters.\n\nHausman (2012) criticizes luck egalitarian and prioritarian accounts\non the grounds that they may imply policies that exacerbate\ninternational inequalities in income or opportunity. Since citizens of\nsome low-income countries experience better health than citizens of\nsome middle- and high-income countries, policies aimed at addressing\nthe poor health outcomes of the latter may exacerbate income\ninequalities among these countries. Luck egalitarian and prioritarian\nviews therefore face difficult questions regarding the prioritization\nof health equality over equality of income or equality of opportunity.\nAs an alternative to these accounts, Hausman (2012: 45) proposes a\nrelational egalitarian account of global health justice, positing that\nsome health inequalities across borders may be drastic enough to\n\n\nrender individuals in one nation vulnerable to domination by other\nnations and diminish their voice in international co-operation.\n\n\nAlthough Hausman\u2019s proposal is more of a sketch than an account\nof global health justice, it faces the above-mentioned problem with\ndomestic relational egalitarian approaches, namely, identifying the\nhealth inequalities which in fact undermine equal relations. For\nexample, when are the difference in life expectancy among citizens of\ntwo countries large enough to imply that they do not have equal status\nwhen representatives negotiate a trade deal?\n\nDaniels (2008) develops an institutionalist approach to global health\njustice. He rejects the cosmopolitan idea that national membership is\nmorally arbitrary on the grounds that co-nationals stand in a morally\nrelevant set of institutionally mediated relationships which establish\nsustainable claims of egalitarian justice. Co-nationals are subject to\nthe same coercively enforced rules of social cooperation of which they\nare the putative co-authors (see Nagel 2005). While Daniels (2008)\nrejects Segall\u2019s claim that global inequalities due to national\nmembership are unjust, he follows Joshua Cohen and Charles Sabel\n(2006) in arguing that international organizations and agreements\nestablish morally relevant relationships and so must be designed in\naccordance with principles of justice. Thus, Daniels (2008) argues,\nthe World Health Organization must show equal concern to all in its\ndistribution of public health expertise and technology, and\ninternational property rights regimes must be designed to better\naddress the global burden of disease.\n\nGopal Sreenivasan (2007b: 221) side steps the above-mentioned debates\nin global distributive justice, and instead offers a non-ideal account\nof global health justice, one which anticipates the \u201cminimum\nrequirements that any plausible and complete ideal theory of\njustice will include\u201d. He argues that the richest nations have\nan obligation to transfer 1% of GDP to the poorest nations with\npriority given to spending it on the determinants of health, including\nhealth care and public health, income and nutrition support, and\neducation. This transfer is neither too demanding, nor, if spent on\nthe determinants of health, too minimal for it promises to\nsubstantially improve the life expectancy of the world\u2019s poorest\npeople (Sreenivasan 2007b).\n",
