    "main_text": "Arguments for Value Incommensurability and Incomparability || Akrasia\n3.3 Akrasia\n\nValue incommensurability also features in debates about\nakrasia (Nussbaum 2001, 113\u2013117). David Wiggins, for example,\ninvokes the idea of value incommensurability to suggest \u201cthe\nheterogeneity of the psychic sources of desire satisfaction and of\nevaluation\u201d (1998, 266). This heterogeneity, according to\nWiggins, allows for a coherent account of the agent\u2019s attraction\nto what is not best. It allows for a divergence between desire and\nvalue such that the akratic individual can be attracted to a value\nthat should not be sought at that point in time. Wiggins invokes value\nincommensurability to capture the idea that a gain in the value that\nshould not be sought does not reduce the loss in choosing what is not\nbest.\n\nIn contrast, Michael Stocker denies that value incommensurability is\nrequired for a coherent account of akrasia (1990, 214\u2013240).\nFor Stocker, coherent akrasia is possible with a single value\nin just the way that it is possible to be attracted to two objects\nthat differ with respect to the same value (e.g., \u201ca languorous\nlesser pleasure and a piquant better pleasure\u201d (1990, 230)).\nRecall the discussion of quantitative and qualitative aspects of a\nsingle value at the outset of section 3.\n",
