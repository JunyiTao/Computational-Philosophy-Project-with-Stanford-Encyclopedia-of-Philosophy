    "main_text": "Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy || Shint\u014d\n3.1 Shint\u014d\n\nThree major philosophical sources have fed into Japanese thought since\nancient times up through the present, two additional ones being added\nin modern times (that is, post-1868). First has been Shint\u014d. In\nits archaic form, especially before its contact with the literary\nphilosophical heritage of continental Asia, it is better termed\nproto-Shint\u014d because it only loosely resembles what we\nnow know as Shint\u014d. Institutional Shint\u014d thought did not\nsignificantly begin until the medieval period and today\u2019s\nShint\u014d philosophy mostly originates in the Native Studies\ntradition beginning in the eighteenth century. That trajectory of\nShint\u014d doctrinal development continued with the rise of\nnationalism and ethnocentrism under the rubric of Shrine Shint\u014d,\nthe institutional arm of State Shint\u014d ideology, which cast a pall\non creative philosophical thinking from the early twentieth century\nuntil 1945. Postwar Japan has witnessed a range of renewed Shint\u014d\nphilosophies, some in the direction of a return to right-wing\nideology, others toward a more liberalized version inspired by Western\nmodels of liberal Christian theology and comparative religious\nscholarship.\n\nProto-Shint\u014d Animism and Naturalism\n\n Proto-Shint\u014d lacked philosophical reflection and even\nself-conscious articulation but is so named because today\u2019s\nShint\u014d has often claimed (sometimes disingenuously) a resonance\nwith its main values, ritual forms, and world view. Dating back to\npreliterate times, proto-Shint\u014d was more an amalgam of beliefs\nand practices lending cohesion to early Japanese communities. As such\nit largely resembled religions in ancient animistic and shamanistic\ncultures found elsewhere in the world. Specifically, the material and\nspiritual were internally related so as to form a continuous field\nwherein the human and the natural, both animate and inanimate, were in\nan interactional, even communicative relation. Kami (often\ntoo restrictively translated into English as \u201cgods\u201d)\nmanifested the power (tama) to inspire awe and could refer to\nanything ranging from a celestial deity to a ghost to a possessed\nhuman being to a spirit within a natural object to a wondrous natural\nobject itself (such as Mt Fuji) to even a special manufactured object\nsuch as a sword. Although human interactions with kami might\nbe either beneficial or harmful, there was no duality or conflict\nbetween good and evil forces. Even within human affairs wrongdoing was\ngenerally a violation or transgression of a taboo, regardless of\nwhether the acts were accidental or intentional. Since criminality or\nsin was not a major consideration, the proper response was not so much\nguilt, repentance, or rehabilitation, but instead ritual purification.\nSpiritual and political leadership shared a common charisma allowing\nthe political leader to serve sacerdotal roles in rituals that brought\nthe community benefits and warded off danger. The rituals, often\nshamanistic in character, mediated the fluid boundaries between the\nheavens, this world, and the underworld as well as the realms of the\nanimate, inanimate, human, and natural.\n\nAlthough, as far as we know, there was no self-reflective\nphilosophizing per se in the preliterate world of proto-Shint\u014d,\nphilosophical ideas introduced from abroad often took root most deeply\nwhen they drew support from some of its basic ideas and values. For\nexample, proto-Shint\u014d animism generally assumed we live in a\nworld of internal relations where various forces and things can be\ndistinguished, but in the end, they are never discrete but inherently\ninterrelated in some way. Indeed because of that reciprocity, one\nmight say the world is not simply what we engage, but also something\nthat engages us. As we define it, it also defines us. Nothing is ever\nsimply material without somehow also having some spirituality; nothing\nis ever simply spiritual without somehow also having some materiality.\nThe ancient proto-Shint\u014d creation myths recount how many parts of\nthe physical world came into being through involuntary divine\nparthenogenesis. For example, the sun and the moon\u2014both the\nphysical objects and the celestial kami associated with\neach\u2014came into being as the effluent of Izanagi\nkami\u2019s eyes when he purified himself in a river after\nbeing polluted by a journey to the realm of the dead. This type of\ngenesis narrative also supports an understanding that every part of\nthe physical world holographically reflects the pattern of spiritual\ncreativity on a cosmic level.\n\nFor proto-Shint\u014d the intersection of the\ndualities\u2014humanity/nature, spirit/matter, good/bad, alive/dead,\nabove/below\u00ad, natural/cosmic\u2014is almost always a preexistent\nintrinsic relation that is not made but discovered, not fixed but\nevolving, not given but nurtured. In the final analysis, reality is\nnot a world of discrete things connected to each other, but more a\nfield of which we are part (a field often expressed by the indigenous\nword kokoro). This form of relation applies to the\nword-reality relation as well. From what we know of proto-Shint\u014d\nritual forms, it seems incantations played a central role in\npurification rites. In those incantations the sounds of the words\nwere, as in magical cultures elsewhere in the world, thought to have\nspecial efficacy beyond the simple semantic meaning. Koto was\na term for both word and thing suggesting that words\nhad the spiritual power (tama) to evoke, and not simply refer\nto, a preexisting reality. Thus, the term kotodama (koto\n+ tama) suggested an onto-phonetic resonance reflecting internal\nrelations among language, sound, and reality.\n\nAlthough many such characteristics of proto-Shint\u014d are found in\nother archaic animistic cultures throughout the world, unlike many of\nthose other locations, in Japan those ancient sensitivities were not\nsuppressed by the imposition of rationalistic philosophies from\noutside. For example, the expansion of Christianity with its\nGreco-Roman philosophical analyses drove underground many older\nanimistic cultures (such as the Druids in the British Isles). When the\nmajor philosophical traditions from continental Asia entered Japan, by\ncontrast, they did not take an oppositional stance toward the world\nview already in place within the archipelago. Therefore, much of\nproto-Shint\u014d\u2019s organicism, vitalism, and the sensitivity to\nthe field of inter-responsive, internal, and holographic relations\ncould survive within the mainstream of Japanese thinking.\n",
