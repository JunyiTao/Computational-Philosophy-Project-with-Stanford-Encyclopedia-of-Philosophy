    "main_text": "The argument from the demographics of nonbelief\n6. The argument from natural nonbelief\n\nMarsh (2013) focuses on natural nonbelief in God\u2019s existence,\n\n\n\u201cnatural\u201d in the sense of being built into the physical or\nbiological structure of the world, and being generally outside the\nscope of human agency and control. (2013: 355)\n\n\nThe cognitive science of religion, combined with ethnographic data for\npre-industrial cultures (Barrett 2007; Bloom 2009; Stark 2007), show\nthat\n\nearly humans, including many anatomically and behaviorally modern\nhumans, originally lacked a concept of God and were religiously\nrestricted to concepts of limited, and sometimes mean, supernatural\nagents. As a result, many [such humans] failed to believe in God or\nanything like God. The nonbelief in question was both naturally\noccurring and nonresistant. (Marsh 2013: 359)\n\n\nThe \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of instances of natural,\nnonresistant nonbelief in early humans is much more surprising on\ntheism than on naturalism, since it is very surprising that \u201cthe\nhuman mind would be naturally so insensitive to the truth about\nreligion\u201d \u201cgiven that a perfect God would desire to enter\ninto a divine-human relationship with early humans\u201d, whereas\n\u201c[g]iven naturalism\u2019s commitment to indifference about\nwhether early humans would be theists\u201d, it\u2019s much less\nsurprising.\n\nMatters get only worse when one adds that (i) Darwinian\nevolution\u2014\u201cthe claim that natural selection, working on\nrandom mutation, is the driving force behind much, if not most,\nevolutionary change\u201d (351)\u2014helps to explain natural\nnonbelief in early humans and (ii) Darwinian evolution is much more\nlikely on naturalism than theism. As for (i),\n\nthere are three basic ways of thinking about religion and natural\nselection. Religion might be an evolutionary byproduct stemming from\nmental architecture and capacities that evolved for nonreligious\npurposes (Barrett 2004); or religion might be adaptive, and so\nselected for directly (Norenzayan and Shariff 2007); or religion might\nstart out as a byproduct of evolved capacities and later be co-opted\nfor adaptive purposes (Powell and Clarke 2012). No matter which option\none favors, the point is that serious religious diversity and early\nnonbelief in a theistic or theistic-like God is to be expected. (Marsh\n2013: 361)\n\n\nAs for (ii), \u201cDarwinism starts out more likely on naturalism\nthan on theism\u201d because \u201cDarwinism is highly optional on\ntheism\u201d, as evidenced by the fact that \u201can omnipotent God\nwould have many non-Darwinian ways to create minds, bodies, and souls\nand would not be limited to Darwinian or even physical\nconstraints\u201d, whereas on naturalism, \u201cthe options for\ndeveloping life are much more constrained, especially in the relevant\ntime frame\u201d (360\u201361).\n\nSo it is, says Marsh, that natural, nonresistant nonbelief in early\nhumans constitutes evidence for naturalism over theism and, when\ncombined with Darwinian evolution, that evidential force increases\nsubstantially.\n\nEvaluating the argument from natural nonbelief interacts with the\ncognitive science of religion and the question of what the\ndemographics of belief, nonbelief, and the capacity for belief\nactually are. \n\nSome have taken the cognitive science of religion to have provided\nempirical support for the universality of, if not theism, then at\nleast religious impulses friendly to theism (cf. Barrett 2004; Clark\nand Barrett 2011). One might think the surprisingness of discovering\ntheistically friendly religious impulses outweighs the contingent\nrelationship of evolution and theism to which Marsh points since our\nexpectations are not what is probabilistically relevant, but rather\nthe comparative likelihoods of the rival hypotheses conditioned on the\nevidence (Anderson 2021). \n\nOthers have taken the cognitive science of religion to have debunked\nor \u201cexplained away\u201d religious belief. For example, it is\nless clear in the case of religion than in other areas what the\n\u201cMilvian Bridge\u201d is that connects fitness to truth\n(Wilkins & Griffiths 2012). An evolutionary byproduct is, by\ndefinition, selected for reasons independent of its function, and\nadaptionist accounts of religion do not typically reference truth as\nthe value in virtue of which religion may be adaptive. To whatever\nextent that it is plausible that evolutionary explanations such as\nthose from the cognitive science of religion successfully undercut\nreligious belief, this only adds greater force to Marsh\u2019s\nargument as one should find it surprising indeed that God would choose\nto use an epistemic method susceptible to debunking. \n\nIt is possible to have a more mixed perspective on the evidence from\nthe cognitive science of religion. For instance, one might argue that\nthe cognitive science of religion provides the atheist\n\u201cintellectual aid and comfort\u201d, even though it does little\nto decide the God debate in favor of the atheist, and yet provides the\ntheist, at best, with a reason to endorse certain theses in reformed\nepistemology (Penner 2018).\n\nFew philosophers, however, have been willing to take a firm stance on\nthe capacities, beliefs, and practices of hominids that predate our\nown species or even pre-Holocene homo sapiens which leaves a\nfair bit of putative natural nonbelief unaccounted for. However, one\nmight argue that \u201cthe earthly careers of early humans form a\nsubplot in a much larger human story that constitutes a life of\nchoiceworthy meaning for them whether they had the conceptual\nresources to grasp that reality or not\u201d (Vandergriff 2016, 36).\nWhether or not one finds such a line persuasive may hinge on key\nconsiderations from the discussion of Schellenberg\u2019s argument,\nnamely, whether or not one thinks God could create such choiceworthy\nlives without this subplot, and whether the kind of meaningful\nrelationship one should expect God to be invested in could possibly\nlack \u201cthe conceptual resources to grasp that reality.\u201d\n",
