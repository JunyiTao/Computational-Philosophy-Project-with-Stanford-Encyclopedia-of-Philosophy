    "main_text": "Theories of Unity || The No Experiential Parts Theory\n7.2 The No Experiential Parts Theory\n\nSearle and Tye are leading current advocates of NEP. Searle ([2000]\n2002: 56) ventures that \u201cmaybe it is wrong to think of\nconsciousness as made up of parts at all\u201d. For one has a\n\u201csingle, unified, conscious field containing visual, auditory,\nand other aspects\u201d and \u201cthere is no such thing as a\nseparate visual consciousness\u201d ([2000] 2002: 55). Do\n\u201cvisual experiences stand to the whole field of consciousness in\nthe part-whole relation?\u201d ([2000] 2002: 54). No, says Searle\n(though he may do some backsliding later in the article). \n\nTye offers a similar view, which he dubs the \u2018one-experience\nview\u2019 (Tye 2003: ch. 1). Considering the polymodal nature of our\nexperience, he says, \u201cThere are not five different \u2026\nexperiences somehow combined together to produce a new unified\nexperience\u201d. Instead, \u201cthere is just one experience\nhere\u201d (2003: 27). \n\nPart of what is at stake in this dispute is how to individuate (how to\ncount) experiences. EP theorists think that experiences go one to an\nobject: if you experience two things, you have two experiences. Or\neven finer: if you experience one thing in two ways, you have had two\nexperiences. NEP theorists hold that some experiences can be\nindividuated differently; a unified act of conscious experiencing is a\nsingle experience, experientially non-composite, no matter how many\nobjects it has. \n\nSo what are the arguments for the two views like? Theorists who accept\nEP usually just assert or even assume it (we saw some examples of this\nin\n Section 7.1).\n The idea just seems intuitively plausible to its adherents and they\ntend not to argue for it. NEP is not intuitively obvious\u2014even\npeople such as Searle who advocate it can find themselves sliding into\nEP\u2014and its adherents do argue for it. \n\nJames was the first champion of NEP. He endorsed it in the course of\nrepudiating the \u2018mind-stuff theory\u2019, according to which\n\u201cour mental states are composite in structure, made up of\nsmaller states conjoined\u201d (1890: 145). Against this James says\nthat, while our experience is complex, this complexity is not a matter\nof there being several experiences (or\n\u2018feelings\u2019) present in an encompassing experience. This is\nbecause \u201cwe cannot mix feelings as such, though we may mix the\nobjects we feel, and from their mixture get new\nfeelings\u201d (1890: 157). If one\u2019s experience appears to\nbecome more complex, that is a matter of a single\nexperience\u2019s content being more complex, and is not the\naddition of more experiences (of the diverse contents).\nIndeed, he says, \u201cWe cannot even \u2026 have two feelings in\nmind at once\u201d (1890: 157).\n\nHere is how this is supposed to work. If we say that experiences\na and b are fused to form experience c, we should\ntreat \u2018fused\u2019 as referring to a process in which a\nand b are superseded by c, not included in it. A\nand b have been replaced by c, in which their contents\nare connected, and they (a and b) no longer exist. As\nJames put it, contrasting the unified consciousness of the whole\nalphabet with the several states involved in consciousness of each\nletter taken singly, \n\n\nIt is safer \u2026 to treat the consciousness of the alphabet as a\ntwenty-seventh fact, the substitute and not the sum of the\ntwenty-six simpler consciousnesses. (1909: 189) \n\n\nThis view clearly avoids the problem of how to combine experiences\nthat faces EP. \n\nSince James had a concept of co-consciousness and we have linked\nco-consciousness closely to EP, we should say a word about his\nconcept. It is not the same as the concept that we find in Parfit,\nLockwood, Hurley, Shoemaker et al. For James, co-consciousness relates\nonly to a multiplicity of items of which one is conscious. In unified\nconscious experience of them, there is no multiplicity of conscious\nstates to enter into a \u2018co\u2019-relationship. Indeed, the\ncontents are made co-conscious by being presented together in a\nsingle, noncomposite experience. \n\nWe will close this discussion with two notes about the relationship of\nthe dispute between EP and NEP to the transparency thesis that we\ndiscussed earlier. This is the thesis that we are not directly\nconscious of our own experiences. (\u2018Transparent\u2019 here\nmeans that while I am conscious via conscious states, I am\nnot conscious of them. I \u2018see through\u2019 them, as\nit were; hence \u2018transparency\u2019.) First, all claims for both\nEP and NEP that we have considered would seem to go through even if\nthe transparency thesis were true. So transparency would not undermine\nthis debate. Secondly, even Tye (2003), who accepts both NEP and\ntransparency, also accepts that NEP does not require or\nentail transparency. Rather, he seems to think that the\ntransparency thesis is true and, since it is true, this constrains\nwhat could be unified in phenomenal unit. Accepting the constraint, he\nhas to say that, \u201cPhenomenal unity is a relation between\nqualities represented in experience, not between qualities\nof experiences\u201d (Tye 2003: 36), however unintuitive\nthis claim may be. Certainly there are approaches that can both accept\nNEP and reject transparency. That is true, for example, of those who\nhold that conscious states are self-representing states, states of\nwhich one becomes conscious just by having them. These theorists will\nhold that one can be directly conscious of one\u2019s own\nconscious states, yet they could still hold that states of unified\nconsciousness have an NEP structure. \n",
