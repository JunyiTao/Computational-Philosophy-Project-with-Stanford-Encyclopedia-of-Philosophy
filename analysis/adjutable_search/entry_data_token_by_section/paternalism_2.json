    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || Hard vs. soft paternalism\n2.1 Hard vs. soft paternalism\n\nSoft paternalism is the view that the only conditions under which\nstate paternalism is justified is when it is necessary to determine\nwhether the person being interfered with is acting voluntarily and\nknowledgeably. To use Mill\u2019s famous example of the person about\nto walk across a damaged bridge, if we could not communicate the\ndanger (he speaks only Japanese) a soft paternalist would justify\nforcibly preventing him from crossing the bridge in order to determine\nwhether he knows about its condition. If he knows, and wants to, say,\ncommit suicide he must be allowed to proceed. A hard paternalist says\nthat, at least sometimes, it may be permissible to prevent him from\ncrossing the bridge even if he knows of its condition. We are entitled\nto prevent voluntary suicide.\n",
