    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics || The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge (1920)\n4.1 The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge (1920)\n\nEinstein\u2019s lectures on relativity in Berlin in 1917\u201318,\nattended at the time by Reichenbach and a handful of others, provided\na shock to Reichenbach\u2019s viewpoint. The Theory of Relativity\nand A Priori Knowledge, published in 1920, is an attempt to\nidentify neo-Kantian doctrines that must be abandoned and to\narticulate what can be salvaged. Twenty-five years before, in his\ndissertation published in 1897, Russell had undertaken a similar\nproject in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, arguing that\nconstant curvature is the geometrical synthetic a priori. In 1902,\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s Science and Hypothesis essentially\nsupplemented Russell\u2019s view with the opinion that the choice of\nconstant curvature geometry is underdetermined; the choice of one such\ngeometry rather than another can always be compensated by a change of\nphysics to save the phenomena. Without mentioning Russell or\nHelmholtz, Reichenbach takes general relativity to have refuted both\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometrical conventionalism and Kant\u2019s\ngeometrical apriorism. Most of the book addresses general\nepistemological issues discussed above rather than issues about\nphysics per se. \n",
