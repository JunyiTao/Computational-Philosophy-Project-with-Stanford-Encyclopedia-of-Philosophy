    "main_text": "The Middle Wittgenstein\u2019s Finitistic Constructivism || Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Finitism and Algorithmic Decidability\n2.3 Wittgenstein\u2019s Intermediate Finitism and Algorithmic Decidability\n\nThe middle Wittgenstein has other grounds for rejecting unrestricted\nquantification in mathematics, for on his idiosyncratic account, we\nmust distinguish between four categories of concatenations of\nmathematical symbols.\n\nProved mathematical propositions in a particular mathematical\ncalculus (no need for \u201cmathematical truth\u201d).\nRefuted mathematical propositions in (or of) a particular\nmathematical calculus (no need for \u201cmathematical\nfalsity\u201d).\nMathematical propositions for which we know we have in hand an\napplicable and effective decision procedure (i.e., we know\nhow to decide them).\nConcatenations of symbols that are not part of any mathematical\ncalculus and which, for that reason, are not mathematical propositions\n(i.e., are non-propositions).\n\n\nIn his 2004 (p. 18), Mark van Atten says that\n\n\u2026 [i]ntuitionistically, there are four [\u201cpossibilities\nfor a proposition with respect to truth\u201d]:\n\n\\(p\\) has been experienced as true\n\\(p\\) has been experienced as false\nNeither 1 nor 2 has occurred yet, but we know a procedure to\ndecide \\(p\\) (i.e., a procedure that will prove \\(p\\) or prove \\(\\neg\np)\\)\nNeither 1 nor 2 has occurred yet, and we do not know a procedure\nto decide \\(p\\).\n\n\n\nWhat is immediately striking about Wittgenstein\u2019s ##1\u20133\nand Brouwer\u2019s ##1\u20133 (Brouwer 1955: 114; 1981: 92) is the\nenormous similarity. And yet, for all of the agreement, the\ndisagreement in #4 is absolutely crucial.\n\nAs radical as the respective #3s are, Brouwer and Wittgenstein agree\nthat an undecided \\(\\phi\\) is a mathematical proposition (for\nWittgenstein, of a particular mathematical calculus) if we\nknow of an applicable decision procedure. They also agree that until\n\\(\\phi\\) is decided, it is neither true nor false (though, for\nWittgenstein, \u2018true\u2019 means no more than \u201cproved in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d). What they disagree about is the status of\nan ordinary mathematical conjecture, such as Goldbach\u2019s\nConjecture. Brouwer admits it as a mathematical proposition, while\nWittgenstein rejects it because we do not know how to algorithmically\ndecide it. Like Brouwer (1948 [1983: 90]), Wittgenstein holds that\nthere are no \u201cunknown truth[s]\u201d in mathematics, but unlike\nBrouwer he denies the existence of \u201cundecidable\npropositions\u201d on the grounds that such a\n\u2018proposition\u2019 would have no \u2018sense\u2019,\n\u201cand the consequence of this is precisely that the propositions\nof logic lose their validity for it\u201d (PR \u00a7173). In\nparticular, if there are undecidable mathematical\npropositions (as Brouwer maintains), then at least some mathematical\npropositions are not propositions of any existent\nmathematical calculus. For Wittgenstein, however, it is a defining\nfeature of a mathematical proposition that it is either decided or\ndecidable by a known decision procedure in a mathematical\ncalculus. As Wittgenstein says at (PR \u00a7151), \n\n\nwhere the law of the excluded middle doesn\u2019t apply, no other law\nof logic applies either, because in that case we aren\u2019t dealing\nwith propositions of mathematics. (Against Weyl and Brouwer). \n\n\nThe point here is not that we need truth and falsity in\nmathematics\u2014we don\u2019t\u2014but rather that every\nmathematical proposition (including ones for which an applicable\ndecision procedure is known) is known to be part of a\nmathematical calculus.\n\nTo maintain this position, Wittgenstein distinguishes between\n(meaningful, genuine) mathematical propositions, which have\nmathematical sense, and meaningless, senseless\n(\u2018sinnlos\u2019) expressions by stipulating that an\nexpression is a meaningful (genuine) proposition of a mathematical\ncalculus iff we know of a proof, a refutation, or an\napplicable decision procedure (PR \u00a7151; PG 452;\nPG 366; AWL 199\u2013200). \u201cOnly where\nthere\u2019s a method of solution [a \u2018logical method for\nfinding a solution\u2019] is there a [mathematical] problem\u201d,\nhe tells us (PR \u00a7\u00a7149, 152; PG 393).\n\u201cWe may only put a question in mathematics (or make a\nconjecture)\u201d, he adds (PR \u00a7151), \u201cwhere the\nanswer runs: \u2018I must work it out\u2019\u201d.\n\nAt (PG 468), Wittgenstein emphasizes the importance of\nalgorithmic decidability clearly and emphatically: \n\n\nIn mathematics everything is algorithm and nothing\nis meaning [Bedeutung]; even when it\ndoesn\u2019t look like that because we seem to be using\nwords to talk about mathematical things. Even these\nwords are used to construct an algorithm. \n\n\nWhen, therefore, Wittgenstein says (PG 368) that if\n\u201c[the Law of the Excluded Middle] is supposed not to hold, we\nhave altered the concept of proposition\u201d, he means that an\nexpression is only a meaningful mathematical proposition if we\nknow of an applicable decision procedure for deciding it\n(PG 400). If a genuine mathematical proposition is\nundecided, the Law of the Excluded Middle holds in the sense\nthat we know that we will prove or refute the\nproposition by applying an applicable decision procedure (PG\n379, 387).\n\nFor Wittgenstein, there simply is no distinction between syntax and\nsemantics in mathematics: everything is syntax. If we wish to\ndemarcate between \u201cmathematical propositions\u201d versus\n\u201cmathematical pseudo-propositions\u201d, as we do, then the\nonly way to ensure that there is no such thing as a\nmeaningful, but undecidable (e.g., independent), proposition\nof a given calculus is to stipulate that an expression is only a\nmeaningful proposition in a given calculus (PR\n\u00a7153) if either it has been decided or we know of an\napplicable decision procedure. In this manner, Wittgenstein defines\nboth a mathematical calculus and a mathematical\nproposition in epistemic terms. A calculus is defined in\nterms of stipulations (PR \u00a7202; PG 369),\nknown rules of operation, and known decision\nprocedures, and an expression is only a mathematical proposition\nin a given calculus (PR \u00a7155), and only if that\ncalculus contains (PG 379) a known (and applicable)\ndecision procedure, for \u201cyou cannot have a logical plan of\nsearch for a sense you don\u2019t know\u201d (PR\n\u00a7148).\n\nThus, the middle Wittgenstein rejects undecidable mathematical\npropositions on two grounds. First, number-theoretic\nexpressions that quantify over an infinite domain are not\nalgorithmically decidable, and hence are not meaningful mathematical\npropositions.\n\n\nIf someone says (as Brouwer does) that for \\((x) f_1 x = f_2 x\\),\nthere is, as well as yes and no, also the case of undecidability, this\nimplies that \u2018\\((x)\\)\u2026\u2019 is meant extensionally and\nwe may talk of the case in which all \\(x\\) happen to have a property.\nIn truth, however, it\u2019s impossible to talk of such a case at all\nand the \u2018\\((x)\\)\u2026\u2019 in arithmetic cannot be taken\nextensionally. (PR \u00a7174)\n\n\n\u201cUndecidability\u201d, says Wittgenstein (PR\n\u00a7174) \u201cpresupposes\u2026 that the bridge cannot\nbe made with symbols\u201d, when, in fact, \u201c[a] connection\nbetween symbols which exists but cannot be represented by symbolic\ntransformations is a thought that cannot be thought\u201d, for\n\u201c[i]f the connection is there,\u2026 it must be possible to\nsee it\u201d. Alluding to algorithmic decidability, Wittgenstein\nstresses (PR \u00a7174) that \u201c[w]e can assert anything\nwhich can be checked in practice\u201d, because\n\u201cit\u2019s a question of the possibility of\nchecking\u201d (italics added).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s second reason for rejecting an undecidable\nmathematical proposition is that it is a\ncontradiction-in-terms. There cannot be \u201cundecidable\npropositions\u201d, Wittgenstein argues (PR \u00a7173),\nbecause an expression that is not decidable in some actual\ncalculus is simply not a mathematical proposition, since\n\u201cevery proposition in mathematics must belong to a calculus of\nmathematics\u201d (PG 376).\n\nThis radical position on decidability results in various radical and\ncounter-intuitive statements about unrestricted mathematical\nquantification, mathematical induction, and, especially, the\nsense of a newly proved mathematical proposition. In\nparticular, Wittgenstein asserts that uncontroversial mathematical\nconjectures, such as Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture (hereafter\n\u2018GC\u2019) and the erstwhile conjecture \u201cFermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem\u201d (hereafter \u2018FLT\u2019), have no sense (or,\nperhaps, no determinate sense) and that the\nunsystematic proof of such a conjecture gives it a sense that\nit didn\u2019t previously have (PG 374) because \n\n\nit\u2019s unintelligible that I should admit, when I\u2019ve got the\nproof, that it\u2019s a proof of precisely this proposition,\nor of the induction meant by this proposition. (PR\n\u00a7155)\n\n\n\nThus Fermat\u2019s [Last Theorem] makes no sense until I can\nsearch for a solution to the equation in cardinal numbers.\nAnd \u2018search\u2019 must always mean: search systematically.\nMeandering about in infinite space on the look-out for a gold ring is\nno kind of search. (PR \u00a7150)\n\nI say: the so-called \u2018Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u2019\nisn\u2019t a proposition. (Not even in the sense of a proposition of\narithmetic.) Rather, it corresponds to an induction. (PR\n\u00a7189)\n\n\nTo see how Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem isn\u2019t a proposition and\nhow it might correspond to an induction, we need to examine\nWittgenstein\u2019s account of mathematical induction.\n",
