    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism || Weakened Internalism\n3.1 Weakened Internalism\n\nThe most conservative strategy for attacking the revisionist\ninterpretation of the EC accepts the bulk of the regress argument\n(theses i, ii and iv) but denies that occurrent awareness of\nwrongdoing (that is, clear-eyed akrasia) is necessary for\nblameworthiness (thesis iii). According to this position, a weaker\nkind of awareness\u2014constituted by dispositional,\ndormant, tacit, or unconscious beliefs\u2014is all that the EC\nrequires (Haji 1997; Peels 2011; Timpe 2011; Husak 2011; Levy 2013\n& 2014: ch. 2; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a: 127). Other proponents\nof this strategy deny that the content of the requisite\nawareness must involve a belief in the action\u2019s overall\nwrongness and claim that a belief in there being sufficient reasons\nnot to perform the action (Robichaud 2014), a belief in one\u2019s\nacting from morally reproachable reasons (Sartorio 2017), or a belief\nin there being a non-negligible risk that one\u2019s action is wrong\n(Guerrero 2007; Nelkin & Rickless 2017a), can be enough for\nblameworthiness. (See also Levy 2014 [ch. 2] who claims that\nresponsibility requires awareness of the facts that give the\naction its moral valence rather than awareness of moral wrongness. Cf.\nLevy 2011 [ch. 6, esp. 141] and\n fn. 3\n above.) We\u2019ll call this position \u2018weakened\ninternalism\u2019: \u2018internalism\u2019 because, like\nvolitionism, it assumes that what the EC requires is the presence of\ncertain mental states that track the action\u2019s moral valence as\nit appears to the agent (Levy 2009); \u2018weakened\u2019 because,\nunlike volitionism, it allows for the possibility that non-occurrent\nmental states, as well as beliefs that fall short of full-blown\nakrasia, satisfy the EC.\n\nIn defense of the volitionist position, Zimmerman offers this\nargument:\n\n\nif a belief is not occurrent, then one cannot act either with the\nintention to heed the belief or with the intention not to heed it; if\none has no such intention, then one cannot act either deliberately on\nor deliberately despite the belief; if this is so, then the belief\nplays no role in the reason for which one performs one\u2019s action;\nand one incurs culpability for one\u2019s action only if one\u2019s\nbelief concerning wrongdoing plays a role in the reason for which one\nperforms the action. (1997: 421\u20132)\n\n\nIn reply, the weakened internalist argues that it\u2019s false that\nonly occurrent beliefs play a role in the reasons for which one acts,\nand so it\u2019s false that an occurrent belief concerning wrongdoing\nis necessary for knowingly doing wrong (Peels 2011: 581\u20132). Take\na non-moral example first: one can decide to go to the park because\none occurrently believes that a break from work is in order, while\nalso (albeit dispositionally) believing that the park is a nice place,\nthat one\u2019s friends frequently gather at the park, that there are\noften amusing performances taking place there, etc. All these beliefs\ncan play a role in the reasons for which one decides to go to the\npark, even though they are dispositional rather than occurrent.\nSomething similar holds in cases of wrongdoing: returning to our\nexample, suppose that while John is preparing his attack on Mary, the\nonly beliefs he occurrently holds concern various aspects of his plan\nand ways of carrying it out undetected. Still, he may hold the\ndispositional belief that what he is planning to do is wrong and, just\nas in the park example, this belief can play a role in the reasons for\nwhich he does wrong (for instance, John may decide to proceed with\nthis plan despite dispositionally believing it\u2019s wrong to do\nso). It thus seems that John is blameworthy despite his belief about\nwrongdoing not being occurrent (Timpe 2011: 23; Levy 2014: 31). If\nthis is correct, then clear-eyed akrasia isn\u2019t necessary for\nblameworthiness.\n\nThis contention can be bolstered by appealing to cases of\nself-deception (Haji 1997: 537\u20139). Suppose that Susan is\ndeliberating whether to pay her taxes. Lately she has been spending\nsignificant amounts of time with some libertarian (in the political\nsense) friends who try to convince her that she has no obligation to\npay taxes because the government is illegitimate. Susan doesn\u2019t\nfind their arguments very convincing, but her strong desire to fit in\nleads her to form a conscious judgment that she shouldn\u2019t pay\nher taxes. At the same time, however, she has an unconscious or\ndispositional belief that it\u2019s all-things-considered wrong not\nto pay taxes. If Susan ends up not paying taxes, it seems correct to\nsay that she did so despite her (dispositional) belief that\nher omission is all-things-considered wrong. So this belief did play a\nrole in the reasons for which she acted, even though it was merely\ndispositional (recall that, according to Zimmerman, a belief plays a\nrole in one\u2019s reasons if one either acts on the belief\nor despite the belief). Susan was \u201cunconsciously\naware\u201d (Haji 1997: 544) that not paying taxes is wrong and this,\naccording to the weakened internalist, suffices for satisfying the\nrequirement of awareness of moral significance and thus for Susan to\nbe blameworthy. So, once again, clear-eyed akrasia isn\u2019t\nnecessary for blameworthiness. On the further assumption that\ndispositional beliefs about wrongdoing are much more common than\noccurrent ones, the weakened internalist position would have shown\nthat the revisionist consequences of the regress argument aren\u2019t\nas severe as originally thought.\n\nAnother line of argument exploited by weakened internalists denies\nthat the content of the requisite awareness must involve a\nbelief in the action\u2019s overall wrongness. For instance, Guerrero\n(2007: 78) argues that if an agent is unsure whether the action she is\nplanning to undertake is permissible or not, and so admits the\npossibility that it might well be wrong, she can be\nblameworthy for carrying it out even in the absence of clear-eyed\nakrasia and even if her ignorance (which is manifested here as lack of\ncertainty) is blameless. (Thus Guerrero, unlike other weakened\ninternalists, deny thesis i of the regress argument, since in his view\nignorant wrongdoing can be culpable in the absence of culpable\nignorance.) This is because there is an independently plausible moral\nprinciple that urges restraint in the face of uncertainty regarding\nthe potential harms that our actions might bring about (2007: 79).\nSimilarly, Nelkin and Rickless (2017a: 121\u20132) claim that being\naware of doing something that poses a risk of forgetting relevant\ninformation can anchor responsibility for unwitting wrongdoing, even\nin the absence of an akratic decision to assume the risk.\n\nIn turn, Robichaud (2014) claims that a belief in there being\nsufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to perform an action\nsatisfies the requirement of awareness of moral significance, which\nentails that one can be blameworthy for performing an action one\nbelieves there are sufficient (albeit not decisive) reasons to avoid.\n(Relatedly, Sartorio [2017: 24\u20138] argues that one can be\nblameworthy if one is aware that one is acting from morally\nreproachable reasons, regardless of whether one is also aware that\none\u2019s action is overall morally wrong.) In so arguing, Robichaud\ndenies an important implicit assumption in the regress argument,\nnamely that an agent can rationally comply with an obligation (moral\nor epistemic), and thus can reasonably be expected to do so, only if\nshe believes that she ought to comply with it and therefore believes\nshe has decisive reasons in its favor (Levy 2009). On the contrary,\nRobichaud argues that for a course of action to be rationally open for\nan agent it isn\u2019t necessary that she believes she has decisive\nreasons in its favor; a belief concerning sufficient reasons is enough\n(Robichaud 2014: 142).
