    "main_text": "Psychology\n5. Psychology\n\nVives\u2019 philosophical reflections on the human soul are mainly\nconcentrated in De anima et vita, published in 1538, which\nprovides the psychological underpinning for many of his educational\nideas and can be characterized as a prolegomenon to moral philosophy.\nHe attempts to reconcile the Aristotelian view of the soul as an\norganizing and animating principle with the Platonic conception of the\nsoul as an immaterial and immortal substance. He also pays close\nattention to physiology and, following the Galenic tradition,\nmaintains that our mental capacities depend on the temperament of our\nbody.\n\nThe structure of the treatise is indebted to the traditional approach\nof faculty psychology, in which the soul is said to be composed of a\nnumber of different faculties or powers, each directed toward a\ndifferent object and responsible for a distinct operation. The first\nbook covers the functions of the vegetative soul (nutrition, growth\nand reproduction), of the sensitive soul (the five external senses),\nand of the cogitative soul (the internal senses, i.e., a variety of\ncognitive faculties, including imagination, fantasy and the estimative\npower, which are located in the three ventricles of the brain, and\nwhose acts follows from the acts of the external senses). The second\nbook deals with the functions of the rational soul and its three\nfaculties (mind, will, and memory), as well as with topics stemming\nfrom Aristotle\u2019s Parva naturalia, such as sleep,\ndreams, and longevity. The third and final book explores the emotions,\nwhich Vives, rejecting the Stoic view, regards as natural responses to\nthe way things appear to us and as essential constituents of human\nlife.\n\nHe defines the soul as \u201cthe principal agent inhabiting a body\nadapted to life (agens praecipuum, habitans in corpore apto ad\nvitam).\u201d The soul is called an agent in the sense that it\nacts through instruments\u2014e.g., heat, humors and spirits\u2014by\nmeans of its own power. That it is the principal agent means that,\neven though its instruments act on the body, they do not operate by\nmeans of their own power but only through the power that they receive\nfrom the soul (III, 335\u20136). The organs governing our rational\nfunctions consist of fine and bright spirits exhaled from the\npericardial blood. Although the heart is the source and origin of all\nthe rational soul\u2019s operations, the head is their workshop. In\nfact, the mind does not apprehend, nor is it affected, unless the\nspirits reach the brain (III, 365\u20136).\n\nThe enormous importance Vives attaches to the exploration of the\nemotions is reflected in the fact that he describes the branch of\nphilosophy that provides a remedy for the severe diseases of the soul\nnot only as \u201cthe foundation of all morality, private as well as\npublic\u201d (III, 299\u2013300), but also as \u201cthe supreme\nform of learning and knowledge\u201d (I, 17). Emotions (affectus\nsive affectiones) are defined as \u201cthe acts of those\nfaculties which nature gave to our souls for the pursuit of good and\nthe avoidance of evil, by means of which we are led toward the good\nand we move away from or against evil\u201d. He stresses that the\nterms \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d in this definition\nmean, not what is in reality good or evil, but rather what each person\njudges to be good or evil (III, 422). Therefore, the more pure and\nelevated the judgment, the more it takes account of what is genuinely\ngood and true, admitting fewer and less intense emotions and becoming\ndisturbed more rarely. Immoderate and confused movements, on the other\nhand, are the result of ignorance, thoughtlessness, and false\njudgments, since we judge the good or evil to be greater than it\nreally is (III, 425).\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of Vives\u2019 study of the\nhuman soul is the fundamental role that psychological inquiry came to\nplay in his reform program. His use of psychological principles in his\nwritings often surpasses that of previous authors in both scope and\ndetail. He applies these principles, for instance, not only to\nindividual conduct and education, but also to professional practice,\nsocial reform, and practical affairs in general. According to Vives,\npsychology is relevant to all disciplines. \u201cThe study of\nman\u2019s soul\u201d, he writes in De tradendis\ndisciplinis, \u201cexercises a most helpful influence on all\nkinds of knowledge, because our knowledge is determined by the\nintelligence and comprehension of our minds, not by the things\nthemselves\u201d (VI, 375).\n",
