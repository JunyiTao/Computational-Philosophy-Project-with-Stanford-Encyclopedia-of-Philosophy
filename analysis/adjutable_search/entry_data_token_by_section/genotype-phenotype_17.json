    "main_text": "What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies || Development as a Genotype to Phenotype Relationship\n6.3 Development as a Genotype to Phenotype Relationship\n\nSeveral of the programs of reintegration sketched in\n section 5\n rest on the idea that development of traits will eventually be\nunderstood in terms of a composite of the influences of DNA variants\non the organism. An alternative approach is to observe that germ cells\nare organized structures, which means that development is always a\nprocess of further organization emerging from initial organization.\nThat emphasis was evident, not only in developmental mechanics\n(Entwickslungsmechanik), but also in a mid-twentieth century\nform of epigenetics centered on embryological or developmental\npathways. Conrad Waddington, for example, undertook experiments on\nvariation in certain characters that was originally seen only in\nresponse to an environmental stress, e.g., enlarged anal papillae (a\nfleshy protuberance) of Drosophila larvae that arose in\nhigher salt concentrations (Waddington 1959). In populations that had\nbeen selected for that responsiveness, eventually the trait occurred\neven when that stress was withdrawn. Waddington\u2019s interpretation\nis that a genotype (in the sense of a specific set of pairs of genes)\nhad arisen in the population that switched on development of large\npapillae. Presumably, this could happen through reassortment of genes\ninto new genotypes, not a random mutation. An alternative hypothesis,\nwhich places more emphasis on the dynamics of development, is that, if\nmany pathways in a non-inbred population can produce the same response\n(e.g., enlarged anal papillae in response to salt), selection results\nin a population of individuals that have a concentration or redundancy\nof the various pathways. If pathways arise within this\nconcentration where large papillae develop without the salt stress,\nthat is not a logical process to be modeled by population genetic or\nquantitative genetic models, but a contingent outcome of the dynamics\nof development in a realm in which a variety of genotypes can\ninfluence a variety of paths to a trait. In this light, to call traits\nphenotypes, and thus suggest that they have a direct association with\na specific genotype, is to make it more difficult to conceive and\npursue a program of reintegration in which researchers examine cases\nof traits that are acquired as an appropriate response to\nenvironmental condition and then increase in frequency in a\npopulation. Moreover, even if such cases turn out not to be common,\nthey trouble the premise that the individual-to-individual\nbarrier to a trait being transmitted back into the genotype\nbarrier means that acquired characters cannot increase in a\npopulation during evolution.\n",
