    "main_text": "Defending the Dharma: A Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows || Against the Ultimate Reality of Virtue\n3.3 Against the Ultimate Reality of Virtue\n\nLike other arguments in the Three Vows, Sapa\u1e47\u2019s\ndisproof of the ultimate reality of virtue is a targeted critique of\nhis Tibetan\n contemporaries.[15]\n In this case, the discussion revolves around a verse from the\nVajradhvaja S\u016btra, in which there is a dedication of all\nbeings\u2019 virtue in the three times (the quote is something like,\n\u201cas much as exists in the past, present and future\u201d).\nOrdinarily, in the Great Vehicle, one altruistically dedicates\none\u2019s virtue (or merit)\u2014what we today euphemistically call\none\u2019s \u201cgood karma\u201d\u2014to all beings, in the hope\nthat one\u2019s own benefits will ripen in them. In this oft-cited\nscriptural passage, the speaker imaginatively maximizes this\nintention, and dedicates all the good karma in the universe, for all\ntime, toward this altruistic purpose. Some, Sapa\u1e47 says,\nmistakenly consider this mass of virtue to be a thing,\nself-established and eternal, and they say that it is equivalent to\nthe \u201cSugata-matrix\u201d, the unelaborated ultimate reality.\nWhat Sapa\u1e47 believes, on the other hand, is that this idea that\nit is possible to dedicate ultimate reality\u2014and that, since one\nonly dedicates wholesome karma, the Dharmadh\u0101tu is a kind of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d\u2014is an error that threatens an\nessential dharma teaching.\n\nOn the surface, then, the argument is a tussle over how to read a\npassage from scripture and its apparent, maximal dedication of merit.\nSince the scripture contains the words to recite that enact the\nbodhisattva vow, it is important from a ritual perspective that one\nunderstand the intention behind it. After all, as he argues, the\nmental intention is the true agent for the engagement of a vow. This\nin itself would be enough to make the issue soteriologically\nsignificant. But what merits extensive treatment is that the idea of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d violates a consistent norm in\nSapa\u1e47\u2019s writings, which is the strict separation between\nconventional and ultimate reality. We have seen this emphasis in his\napproaches to epistemology and will see it in the doctrine of\nemptiness as well, but here we see the practical, ritual-cum-ethical\napplication of this stance.\n\nSapa\u1e47 begins the argument by quoting a wide range of\nauthoritative sources to show that the \u201cSugata-matrix\u201d is\nunchanging, that it is equivalent to the Dharmadh\u0101tu and the\nTath\u0101gata-nature, and that these are all completely devoid of\nevil and virtue, which are illusory\n constructions.[16]\n Near the end of the passage Sapa\u1e47 recommends that the reader\nstudy, in particular, the Dharmodgata chapter of the Perfection of\nWisdom in 8,000 Lines (I.137; Rhoton 2002: 58). That chapter\nteaches that suchness, Tath\u0101gata and emptiness are all the same,\nwhich is to say they are immobile and unproduced, unrelated to all\nnumbers (including one), unrelated to all concepts whatsoever, and yet\ngreater than\u2014infinitely beyond\u2014anything conceivable. If\nthe Dharmadh\u0101tu thus described does not change, it cannot go from\nbeing undedicated to dedicated; which means that you cannot dedicate\nit. Sapa\u1e47 writes that the Vajradhvaja\nS\u016btra\u2019s expressions \u201cas much as\u201d and\n\u201cexists\u201d (from \u201cas much as exists in the past,\npresent and future\u201d) could not possibly refer to the\nDharmadh\u0101tu: \u201cAs much as\u201d appeals to the rejected\nidea of number, and, as he cites many sources to show, it is false to\nsay of the ultimate that it either \u201cexists\u201d or \u201cdoes\nnot exist\u201d. Based on scripture alone, then, this passage could\nnot imply the dedication of the Dharmadh\u0101tu. The passage is just\nsaying that we dedicate the actions (the karma) of\nall beings\u2014just, whatever virtuous actions beings perform. This\nkeeps the dedication ritual firmly in the realm of conventional,\nchanging, illusory, reality.\n\nSapa\u1e47 cites the possibility that the basis for the idea of\n\u201cexistent virtue\u201d is the Abhidharmasamuccaya of\nAsa\u1e45ga, which does call the Dharmadh\u0101tu\n\u201cvirtue\u201d, distinguishing it from the evils of cyclic\nexistence, and using terms such as \u201cnatural virtue\u201d and\n\u201cabsolute virtue\u201d. Sapa\u1e47 considers this passage\nmerely figurative. It is like calling people whose hunger is sated,\n\u201cdesireless\u201d\u2014when of course they still have other\ndesires. To call the Dharmadh\u0101tu \u201cvirtue\u201d is only to\nrefer to the absence of evil\u2014to emptiness itself. But the\nDharmadh\u0101tu is not itself the cause of well-being, which\nis how virtue was defined. If the Dharmadh\u0101tu caused\nwell-being, all actions would be virtuous, since all things are\ncontained within it. Sapa\u1e47 gives a similarly figurative reading\nto the Uttaratantra\u2019s discussion of an innately\nexistent Buddhahood; it cannot mean this literally, he says,\nsince otherwise it would be affirming a non-Buddhist belief in an\neternal soul.\n\nUltimate reality\u2019s numberless freedom from conceptual\nelaborations is, needless to say, a difficult idea to fathom. After\nall, we could only fathom it by means of concepts. But the notion\nallows Sapa\u1e47 to reject a number of intermediate proposals, such\nas the notion that perhaps the dedicatable Sugata-matrix refers only\nto the animate portion of the Dharmadh\u0101tu. As he\nreplies, there are no distinctions and hence no \u201cportions\u201d\nin the Dharmadh\u0101tu! That\u2019s what it means to say that it is\nfree of elaborations.\n",
