    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition\n6.2 Intuitive and Abstractive Cognition\n\nOne of the more intriguing features of late medieval epistemology in\ngeneral, and of Ockham\u2019s view in particular, is the development\nof a theory known as \u201cintuitive and abstractive\ncognition.\u201d The theory is found in authors as diverse as Duns\nScotus, Peter Auriol, Walter Chatton, and Ockham. But their theories\nof intuitive and abstractive cognition are so different that it is\nhard to see any one thing they are all supposed to be theories of.\nNevertheless, to a first approximation, intuitive cognition can be\nthought of as perception, whereas abstractive cognition is closer to\nimagination or remembering. The fit is not exact, however, since\nauthors who had a theory of intuitive and abstractive cognition\nusually also allowed the distinction at the intellectual\nlevel as well.\n\nIt is important to note that abstractive cognition, in the sense of\nthis theory, has nothing necessarily to do with\n\u201cabstraction\u201d in the sense of producing universal concepts\nfrom cognitive encounters with individuals. Instead, what abstractive\ncognition \u201cabstracts\u201d from is the question of the\nexistence or non-existence of the object. By contrast,\nintuitive cognition is very much tied up with the existence or\nnon-existence of the object. Here is how Ockham distinguishes\n them:[45]\n\nFor intuitive cognition of a thing is a cognition such that by virtue\nof it it can be known whether the thing exists or not, in such a way\nthat if the thing does exist, the intellect at once judges it to exist\nand evidently knows it to exist \u2026 Likewise, intuitive cognition\nis such that when some things are known, one of which inheres in the\nother or the one is distant in place from the other or is related in\nanother way to the other, it is at once known by virtue of the\nincomplex cognitions of those things whether the thing inheres or does\nnot inhere, whether it is distant or not distant, and so on for other\ncontingent truths \u2026\n\n\nAbstractive cognition, however, is that by virtue of which it cannot\nbe evidently known of the thing whether it exists or does not exist.\nAnd in this way abstractive cognition, as opposed to intuitive\ncognition, \u201cabstracts\u201d from existence and non-existence,\nbecause by it neither can it be evidently known of an existing thing\nthat it exists, nor of a non-existent one that it does not exist.\n\n\nOckham\u2019s main point here is that an intuitive cognition\nnaturally causes in the mind a number of true\ncontingent judgements about the external thing(s) that caused\nthis intuitive cognition; for example, that this thing exists, or that\nit is white, and so on. This does not prevent God from deceiving any\nparticular creature if He wants to, even when an intuitive cognition\nis present, but in such a case, God would have to neutralize the\nnatural causal effect of this intuitive cognition (this is something\nHe can always do, according to Ockham) and directly cause instead a\nfalse judgement. Intuitive cognitions, on the other hand, can\nsometimes induce false beliefs, too, if the circumstances are abnormal\n(in cases of perceptual illusions in particular), but even then, they\nwould still cause some true contingent judgements. The latter at any\nrate is their distinctive feature. Abstractive cognitions, by\ncontrast, are not such as to naturally cause true judgements about\ncontingent\n matters.[46]\n",
