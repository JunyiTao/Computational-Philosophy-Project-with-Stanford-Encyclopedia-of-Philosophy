    "main_text": "Overview\n1. Overview\n\nWhat are biological species? At first glance, this seems like an easy\nquestion to answer. Homo sapiens is a species, and so is\nCanis familiaris. Many species can be easily distinguished.\nWhen we turn to the scientific literature on species, the nature of\nspecies becomes much less clear. Biologists offer over twenty\ndefinitions of the term \u2018species\u2019 (Hey 2001). These\ndefinitions are not fringe accounts of species but prominent\ndefinitions in the biological literature. Philosophers also disagree\non the nature of species. Their primary concern is the ontological\nstatus of species. Some philosophers believe that species are natural\nkinds. Others maintain that species are particulars or\nindividuals.\n\nThe concept of species plays an important role both in and outside of\nbiology. Within biology, species are the fundamental units of\nbiological classification. Species are also units of\nevolution\u2014groups of organisms that evolve in a unified way.\nOutside of biology, the concept of species plays a role in debates\nover environmental law and ecological preservation. Our conception of\nspecies even affects our understanding of human nature. From a\nbiological perspective humans are the species Homo\nsapiens.\n\nThis entry discusses a number of philosophical issues concerning\nspecies. The first issue is their ontological status. Are species\nnatural kinds, individuals, or sets? The second issue concerns species\npluralism. Monists argue that biologists should attempt to find the\ncorrect definition of \u2018species.\u2019 Pluralists disagree. They\nargue that there is no single correct definition of\n\u2018species\u2019 but a plurality of equally correct definitions.\nThe third issue concerns the reality of species. Does the term\n\u2018species\u2019 refer to a real category in nature? Or, as some\nphilosophers and biologists argue, is the term \u2018species\u2019 a\ntheoretically empty designation? The fourth and final issue concerns\nhow social values affect which definitions of \u2018species\u2019\nbiologists use. \n",
