    "main_text": "Malament\u2019s Theorem\n3. Malament\u2019s Theorem\n\n\nFor a discussion of various proposals to establish synchrony, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nTransport of Clocks\n\n\nThe only currently discussed proposal is based on a theorem of\nMalament (1977), who argues that standard synchrony is the only\nsimultaneity relation that can be defined, relative to a given\ninertial frame, from the relation of (symmetric) causal\nconnectibility. Let this relation be represented by \u03ba, let the\nstatement that events p and q are simultaneous be represented\nby S(p,q), and let the given inertial frame\nbe specified by the world line, O, of some inertial\nobserver. Then Malament\u2019s uniqueness theorem shows that if\nS is definable from \u03ba and O, if it is an\nequivalence relation, if points p on O and\nq not on O exist such that\nS(p,q) holds, and if S is not the\nuniversal relation (which holds for all points), then S is\nthe relation of standard synchrony.\n\n\nSome commentators have taken Malament\u2019s theorem to have settled\nthe debate on the side of nonconventionality. For example, Torretti\n(1983, 229) says, \u201cMalament proved that simultaneity by standard\nsynchronism in an inertial frame F is the only\nnon-universal equivalence between events at different points\nof F that is definable (\u2018in any sense of\n\u201cdefinable\u201d no matter how weak\u2019) in terms of causal\nconnectibility alone, for a given F\u201d; and Norton\n(Salmon et al. 1992, 222) says, \u201cContrary to most\nexpectations, [Malament] was able to prove that the central claim\nabout simultaneity of the causal theorists of time was false. He\nshowed that the standard simultaneity relation was the only nontrivial\nsimultaneity relation definable in terms of the causal structure of a\nMinkowski spacetime of special relativity.\u201d\n\n\nOther commentators disagree with such arguments, however.\nGr\u00fcnbaum (2010) has written a detailed critique of Malament\u2019s\npaper. He first cites Malament\u2019s need to postulate that S is an\nequivalence relation as a weakness in the argument, a view also\nendorsed by Redhead (1993, 114). Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s main argument,\nhowever, is based on an earlier argument by Janis (1983,\n107\u2013109) that Malament\u2019s theorem leads to a unique (but\ndifferent) synchrony relative to any inertial observer, that this\nlatitude is the same as that in introducing Reichenbach\u2019s \u03b5,\nand thus Malament\u2019s theorem should carry neither more nor less weight\nagainst the conventionality thesis than the argument\n(mentioned above in the last paragraph of the\nfirst section of this article) that standard synchrony is the simplest\nchoice. Gr\u00fcnbaum concludes \u201cthat Malament\u2019s remarkable\nproof has not undermined my thesis that, in the STR, relative\nsimultaneity is conventional, as contrasted with its\nnon-conventionality in the Newtonian world, which I have articulated!\nThus, I do not need to retract the actual claim I made in\n1963\u2026\u201d Somewhat similar arguments are given by Redhead\n(1993, 114) and by Debs and Redhead (2007, 87\u201392).\n\nFor further discussion, see the supplement document:\n\nFurther Discussion of Malament\u2019s Theorem\n\n",
