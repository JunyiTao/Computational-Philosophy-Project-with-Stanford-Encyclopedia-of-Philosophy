    "main_text": "Is Consciousness Unified? || Consciousness Must be Unified\n3.2 Consciousness Must be Unified\n\nThat said, there are theorists who maintain not only that some\nconscious states in a subject are unified but that all conscious\nstates must be unified. Bayne and Chalmers (2003: 24; Bayne\n2010: ch. 1.4) call this the unity thesis: necessarily, any\nset of conscious states of a subject at a time is unified. As we saw,\nBrentano probably held this view. Hill (1991) does, too. Scepticism\nabout this view would be weaker than either of the two kinds of\nscepticism about unified consciousness that we just examined.\n\nBayne and Chalmers express sympathy for the thesis on the grounds\nthat, \n\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to imagine a subject having two\nphenomenal states simultaneously, without there being a conjoint\nphenomenology for both states. (2003: 37) \n\n\nMerely having phenomenal states might seem too little but\nBayne and Chalmers are talking about phenomenal states where, for\nthem, to have the state is for the state to be like something. If we\nrecast to make this element explicit, we get a claim of some real\nintuitive appeal: If A is like something to S and\nB is like something to S, it must be the case that the\ncombination, A and B, is like something to S.\nInterestingly, Kant seems to have believed something similar:\n\u201c[Experiences] can represent something to me only insofar as\nthey belong with all others to one consciousness\u201d (A116).\nA and B having conjoint phenomenology is exactly what\nunity consists in, according to Bayne and Chalmers. Put this way, the\nunity thesis has some real appeal.\n\nAre there reasons to be sceptical of the unity thesis, presumptive\ncounter-examples say? Spelled out as we have spelled it out, we do not\nknow of any. Bayne and Chalmers consider brain bisection cases to be\nputative counter-examples because, on some concepts of the subject of\nexperience, we can think of there still being one subject in these\ncases even though not all the conscious states are unified. There are\nat least three ways to respond. The simplest is just to deny that\nthere is one subject, at least for the period of the split. A second\nwould be to note that, however one counts subjects during the period\nof the split, there is evidence that many conscious experiences in\nthat body are not like anything to some subject. If so, the apparent\nlack of conjoint consciousness of them will not be a problem.\nA third (advocated by Bayne & Chalmers 2003: 38\u20139; Bayne\n2010: ch. 9) would be to urge that while there is clearly a breach in\nthe unity of access consciousness (access to information for purposes\nof belief formation, behavioural control, and so on) during the period\nof the split, phenomenal unity may still extend across all the\nconscious experience. We will discuss the third response in more\ndetail in\n Section 4.2\n below.\n\nThe unity thesis is a very strong thesis. Theorists could hold both\nthat consciousness is unified and that this unity is important and yet\ndeny that the unity thesis is true. \n",
