    "main_text": "Diagrams as Representational Systems || Venn Diagrams\n2.2 Venn Diagrams\n\nVenn\u2019s criticism of Euler Circles is summarized in the following\npassage:\n\nThe weak point in this [Euler diagrams], and in all similar schemes,\nconsists in the fact that they only illustrate in strictness the\nactual relation of classes to each other, rather than the imperfect\nknowledge of these relations which we may possess, or may wish to\nconvey by means of the proposition. (Venn\n 1881:\n 510)\n\n\nBecause of its strictness, Euler\u2019s system sometimes fails in\nrepresenting consistent pieces of information in a single diagram, as\nshown above. In addition to this expressive limitation, Euler\u2019s\nsystem also suffers other kinds of expressive limitations with respect\nto non-empty sets, due to topological restrictions on plane figures\n(see\n Section 3.1).\n\nVenn\u2019s new system\n (1881)\n was to overcome these expressive limitations so that partial\ninformation can be represented. The solution was his idea of\n\u2018primary diagrams\u2019. A primary diagram represents all the\npossible set-theoretic relations between a number of sets, without\nmaking any existential commitments about them. For example, Figure 2\nshows the primary diagram about sets A and B.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Venn\u2019s Primary diagrams\n\n\nAccording to Venn\u2019s system, this diagram does not convey any\nspecific information about the relation between these two sets. This\nis the major difference between Euler and Venn diagrams.\n\nFor the representation of universal statements, unlike the visually\nclear spatial containment relations in the case of Euler diagrams,\nVenn\u2019s solution is \u2018to shade them [the appropriate areas]\nout\u2019 (Venn\n 1881:\n 122). By using this syntactic device, we obtain diagrams for\nuniversal statements as shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Venn\u2019s shading\n\n\nVenn\u2019s choice of shading might not be absolutely arbitrary in\nthat a shading could be interpreted as a visualization of set\nemptiness. However, it should be noted that a shading is a new\nsyntactic device which Euler did not use. This revision gave\nflexibility to the system so that certain compatible pieces of\ninformation may be represented in a single diagram. In the following,\nthe diagram on the left combines two pieces of information, \u201cAll\nA are B\u201d and \u201cNo A is\nB,\u201d to visually convey the information \u201cNothing\nis A.\u201d The diagram on the right, which represents both\n\u201cAll A are B\u201d and \u201cAll B\nare A,\u201d clearly shows that A is the same as\nB:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, using primary diagrams also avoids some other expressivity\nproblems (to do with spatial properties of diagram objects) discussed\nbelow, in\n Section 3.\n Surprisingly, Venn was silent about the representation of existential\nstatements, which was another difficulty of Euler diagrams. We can\nonly imagine that Venn might have introduced another kind of a\nsyntactic object representing existential commitment. This is what\nCharles Peirce did about twenty years later. \n",
