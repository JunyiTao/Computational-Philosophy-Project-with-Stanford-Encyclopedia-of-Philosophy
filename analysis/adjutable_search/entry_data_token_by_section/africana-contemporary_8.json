    "main_text": "Stage one: emergence || Complications\n4.3 Complications\n\nThe period of emergence set the stage for contemporary work in\nAfricana philosophy by establishing many of the key elements that\nwould come to define the field. Careful study of the period, however,\nreveals some important challenges that continue to confront\ncontemporary work.\n\nOne important complication is the overlay of bias that constrains\nstandard notions of what counts as an intellectual contribution and of\nwho counts as a contributor. The standard notions tend to focus on the\nwritten output of elite men, even in studies of populations, cultures,\nand societies that are not at the top of the relevant social\nhierarchies. Considering the reasons for these biases is beyond the\nscope of this piece, though we can say that some reasons are better\nthan others. (To be sure, writerly output\u2014literature\u2014is\neasier to track and preserve than orature. But even the\nwritten contributions of women are routinely ignored or\nexcluded from the economies of writerly production.)\n\nSuffice it to say for now that one of the recurring challenges of\nAfricana thought in its philosophical modes has to do with crediting\nthe philosophical labor that goes into assembling a responsible life\nunder absurd conditions, when the laborers don\u2019t look or act\nlike standard-issue philosophers. For recent thinkers like Fred Moten\n(2017) in his study of artist Thornton Dial, this is sometimes a\nquestion about the philosophical significance of aesthetic\nproductions. For others, as we\u2019ll soon consider further, it is a\nquestion about the philosophical content of political activism or of\nvernacular cultures. It is almost always, of course, a question about\ncrediting the work of women and people without wealth, high incomes,\nhomes, and other markers of high socioeconomic status.\n\nA second important complication is rooted in a simple question: what\nhappens to local or national traditions if one focuses on broadly\nregional approaches to Africana philosophy? One way to ask this\nquestion is to focus on the differences between, say, Haiti and\nJamaica, and on the differences between Antenor Firmin and Marcus\nGarvey. Another way is to insist on the integrity and importance of\ndistinct national traditions of recognized and recognizably\nphilosophical activity, as Teodros Kiros (2004) and a number of\nscholars do in relation to figures like the 17th century\nEthiopian philosopher Zera Yacob.\n\nThere are two things to say about this possible tension between the\nregional or transnational and the local or national. First, it is\neminently possible for analyses at different scales to co-exist. The\nquestion is just whether there is sufficient warrant to sustain an\nanalysis at each level. One of the main aims of the early stages of\nprofessional Africana philosophy, as we\u2019ll soon see, was\nprecisely to show that there was a transnational enterprise related to\nAfricanaity that required\u2014and had long\nprovoked\u2014philosophical reflection. This in no way precludes more\nlocal studies. Second, one of the central claims of Africana\nphilosophy is that local contexts are often profoundly informed by\nbroader dynamics. Whether those dynamics matter in specific cases is a\nmatter to be settled by appeal to the details of the cases. One\nundeniable feature of the modern world is the way globe-spanning ideas\nabout things like race, reason, and civilization have shaped the life\nchances of large swathes of humanity for generations. This would seem\nto have some bearing on philosophical activity in African communities\nand communities in its diaspora.\n",
