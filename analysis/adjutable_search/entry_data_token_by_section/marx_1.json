    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Paris\n1.2 Paris\n\nBetween late 1843 and early 1845, Marx lived in Paris, a cosmopolitan\ncity full of \u00e9migr\u00e9s and radical artisans. He was\nsubsequently expelled by the French government following Prussian\npressure. In his last months in Germany and during this Paris exile,\nMarx produced a series of \u201cearly writings\u201d, many not\nintended for publication, which significantly altered interpretations\nof his thought when they were published collectively in the twentieth\ncentury. Papers that actually saw publication during this period\ninclude: \u201cOn the Jewish Question\u201d (1843) in which Marx\ndefends Jewish Emancipation against Bruno Bauer (1809\u20131882), but\nalso emphasises the limitations of \u201cpolitical\u201d as against\n\u201chuman\u201d emancipation; and the \u201cCritique of\nHegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right: Introduction\u201d (1844) which\ncontains a critical account of religion, together with some prescient\nremarks about the emancipatory potential of the proletariat. The most\nsignificant works that Marx wrote for self-clarification rather than\npublication in his Paris years are the so-called \u201c1844\nManuscripts\u201d (1844) which provide a suggestive account of\nalienation, especially of alienation in work; and the \u201cTheses on\nFeuerbach\u201d (1845), a set of epigrammatic but rich remarks\nincluding reflections on the nature of philosophy.\n",
