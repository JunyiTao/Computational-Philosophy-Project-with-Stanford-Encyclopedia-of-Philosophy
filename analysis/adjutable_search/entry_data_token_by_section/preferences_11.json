    "main_text": "Preferences combination || Managing preference conflicts\n4.1 Managing preference conflicts\n\nThe most convenient way to represent problems with multiple preference\naspects is to introduce a vector \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\succcurlyeq_n \\rangle\\) whose elements are the preference relations\nwe have to take into account. For simplicity, we can assume that all\nthese preferences are complete (or we can treat incompleteness as\nindifference). We can call such a vector conflict free if and\nonly if it has no elements \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) and \\(\\succcurlyeq_m\\)\nsuch that \\(X \\succ_k Y\\) and \\(Y \\succ_m X\\) for any alternatives\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots ,\\succcurlyeq_n\n\\rangle\\) is conflict free, then we can define a combined preference\nrelation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) such that (1) \\(X\\succ Y\\) if there is some\n\\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) such that \\(X\\succ_k Y\\), (2) \\(Y\\succ X\\) if there\nis some \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) such that \\(Y\\succ_k X\\), and (3) otherwise\n\\(X\\sim Y\\). This is a plausible construction for conflict free\npreferences, since the combined preference relation does not\ncontradict any of the strict preferences expressed in the component\nvectors. \n\nFor conflictual preference vectors, i.e. vectors that are not\nconflict free, there is no such simple solution that is plausible in\nall applications. There are five common ways to deal with conflicts\namong preferences.\n\n1. Reduction to a single dimension. Such reductions are\nusually performed by first translating all preference relations into\nsome numerical value, and then, for each alternative, adding up the\nvalues assigned to it for all aspects. In utilitarian moral\nphilosophy, a fictional value unit, \u201cutile\u201d, is used for\nthis purpose. In economics, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) instead uses monetary units. However in many cases\nthere is uncertainty or disagreement on how the reductions should be\nperformed. \n\n2. Assuming that all conflicts cancel each other out. This\namounts to extending the above definition of a combined preference\nrelation so that \\(X\\sim Y\\) will hold in all cases of conflict,\ni.e. whenever there are \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) and \\(\\succcurlyeq_m\\) such\nthat \\(X \\succ_k Y\\) and \\(Y \\succ_m X\\). Although usually not\nexpressed in this way, this is the effect of applying efficiency as\nthe sole criterion (e.g. Pareto efficiency as the sole criterion in a\nmulti-person case). This method has the obvious disadvantage that it\nsometimes lets a small disadvantage in one dimension outweigh a large\nadvantage in another dimension. \n\n3. Majoritarian solutions. Another way to deal with conflicts\nis to look for the alternatives that are favoured by most (but not necessarily all) of the preference relations. This requires that the aspects\ncovered by the different preference relations are valued equally.\nTherefore, this solution is commonly used when the elements of the\nvector correspond to the wishes or interests of different persons, but\nnot when they correspond to more general aspects of a decision (such\nas sustainability and aesthetics in the example of of choosing an\narchitectural design). \n\n4. Intuitive weighing. In practice, decision makers often\nweigh different preference dimensions against each other intuitively,\nwithout any prior attempt to reduce the multi-dimensionality of the\ndecision. This way of dealing with multiple preferences has practical\nadvantages, but it also has the disadvantage of lacking efficient\nmechanisms for ensuring consistency in decision-making. \n\n5. Modifying at least one of the conflicting preference\nrelations. This is what happens when people involved in\nnegotiations or discussions approach each other\u2019s views in ways that\nmake their preference relations less conflicting. The Delphi method is\na systematized procedure that can be used to reduce interindividual\ndifferences in preferences. On an intraindividual level, strivings for\na reflective equilibrium can take the form of adjusting preference\nrelations that concern different aspects of an issue to each\nother. From a psychological point of view, such changes can be\ndescribed as reductions of cognitive dissonance in value issues.\n\nVoting procedures are often described as methods for aggregating or\ncombining preferences. Such aggregation can also be performed by a\nbenevolent planner striving to take the wishes and/or interests of all\nconcerned persons into account. The aggregation of preferences is a\nmajor topic of social choice theory. See the entry on \n social choice theory.\n",
