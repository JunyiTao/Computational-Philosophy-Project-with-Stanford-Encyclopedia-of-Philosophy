    "main_text": "Setting the Scene: Different Kinds of Meanings of Genotype and Phenotype\n1. Setting the Scene: Different Kinds of Meanings of Genotype and Phenotype\n\nThe meaning of the terms given at the start of the introduction may at\nfirst seem clear, but conceptual questions have accompanied or been\nimplied by the use of the terms since their introduction to\nEnglish-language readers by Johannsen\u2019s (1911) \u201cThe\nGenotype Conception of Heredity\u201d and up until the present. How\ndoes an individual organism\u2019s DNA influence the processes of\ndevelopment of its traits over its lifetime\u2014processes that also\ninvolve other influences? How can an individual organism\u2019s\ntraits be used to identify its DNA sequence? Why are the terms\ngenotype and phenotype still used if they simply refer to the\nindividual\u2019s DNA and traits? One answer to this last question is\nthat what counts is less the meaning of the terms than what their use\nhas come to signify, in particular, that certain issues have\nbeen resolved: the barrier between the organism\u2019s life course\nand DNA transmitted to the next generation; evolution is change in\nfrequencies of genes or DNA sequences in populations over time;\ndevelopment of traits will eventually be understood in terms of a\ncomposite of the effects of DNA on the organism; what counts is what\nis underneath or inside the observable surface; and findings about\nheredity derived using one meaning of terms affirm findings derived\nusing a different meaning. How firmly resolved are these issues? If\none wants to open them up for further scrutiny, it could be helpful to\nquestion the meaning of genotype, phenotype, and the distinction\nbetween them.\n\nAnother response to why the terms continue to be used is that the\npredominant meanings are not the only ones. Type connotes a\nclass. This sense of the terms leads to further questions:\nWhat makes organisms similar enough to be grouped in a genotype as a\nclass? \u2026or in a phenotype as a class? How is the membership of\norganisms in a genotype manifest in their membership in a\nphenotype\u2014or phenotypes? How can the membership of organisms in\na phenotype be used to identify their membership in a genotype? Type\nalso connotes an abstraction away from the full set of\nobserved characteristics. What then is to be accentuated and what\nde-emphasized about a genotype and phenotype, as DNA and traits or as\nclasses\u2014especially when asking any of the previous questions?\nAnd how\u2014by what concepts, methods, and models\u2014is what has\nbeen de-emphasized to be brought back and re-integrated into\nthe scientific account? \n\nTo make sense of the original meanings of the terms and the\ndistinction between them as well as the coexistence of different kinds\nof meanings since then, a specific kind of abstraction (see entry on\n abstract objects)\n is pertinent, namely, the material practices of\ncontrol over biological materials and conditions advanced in\nmodern experimental biology and agricultural breeding or entailed in\nthe allied use of models in analysis of data. Reliable\nmethods more than endorsable theories are the touchstone of this kind\nof abstraction. It is within a framing of control\u2014and the\nconsequent challenge of reintegration\u2014that this entry discusses\nthe other senses already mentioned of the terms genotype and\nphenotype: in the context of the relationship between an\nindividual\u2019s DNA and traits; what the use of the terms\nsignifies; and grouping into classes. (Given the continuing\ncoexistence of the different kinds of meaning of the terms, qualifiers\nare used when there might be ambiguity.)\n\nAlthough there may be grounds to revise various positions and\ninquiries about the genotype-phenotype relationship in light\nof assumptions made about control and eventual reintegration, such\ndiscussion lies beyond the scope of this entry. (If the\ngenotype-phenotype relationship were the entry\u2019s focus, more\nattention would need to be given to philosophical arguments about\ncausality and about abstraction as it relates to causal claims; see\nWinther 2014 for an entry point and\n section 7.)\n The entry also cannot do justice to the rich social and economic\nhistory of heredity, where concrete cases abound concerning the\ncontrol of biological materials for production and\nbreeding\u2014dating from well before the genotype-phenotype\ndistinction through to present-day biotechnology. (Readers wanting to\nreintegrate the history and context might usefully start with the\nessays collected in M\u00fcller-Wille et al. 2008b, Deichmann et al.\n2014, and M\u00fcller-Wille & Brandt 2016, and references cited\ntherein. M\u00fcller-Wille 2008 and Bonneuil 2016, in particular,\ndescribe Johannsen\u2019s professional and modernizing aspirations\nand place them in their economic context. Rolls-Hansen 2014 places\nJohannsen\u2019s 1911 contribution in the context of shifts in his\nviews over his career.) \n",
