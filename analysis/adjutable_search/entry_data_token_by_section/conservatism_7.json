    "main_text": "The Development of Conservative Thought || Burkean conservatism\n2.3 Burkean conservatism\n\nLiberalism was defined by J.S. Mill, who as Skorupski comments\n\u201c[drove] so many windows onto its innermost commitments\u201d,\ninterrogating its values and policies (Skorupski 1989: 338); socialism\nwas defined by Marx. For most conservatives, Burke largely defines\nmodern conservatism\u2014even if his \u201cwindows\u201d, unlike\nMill\u2019s, seem more like panes of frosted glass. We now examine\nhis ideas and how they arose. \n\nIn his Reflections on the Revolution in France, the Irish\nWhig and parliamentarian Edmund Burke (1729\u20131797) warned against\nrevolutions and their utopian schemes for human perfectibility.\nWriting in 1790, he predicted the French Revolutionary Terror of three\nyears later:\n\n\nIn the groves of [the] academy [of this new conquering empire of light\nand reason], at the end of every vista, you see nothing but the\ngallows; (Burke, WS III: 128)\n\n\nhe also foresaw Napoleon\u2019s coup. His prediction is based on his\nview that when compliance no longer flows from customary allegiances,\nthe result is naked force (WS VIII: 128). As Steiner comments,\n\n\nWhen Burke reflected and published, the French Revolution was in its\nArcadian phase [and] his bloodstained previsions seemed nearly\nhysterical\u2026Retroactively\u2026 his sombre clairvoyance took\non formidable weight. (Steiner 1988: 3; see Lock 2006: Vol. 2)\n\n\nHe provided \u201cthe first serious argument that revolutions devour\ntheir own children and turn into their own opposites\u201d (Hitchens\n2011: 161)\u2014that the violent seizure of power invites its violent\ncounter-seizure. Its British friends compared the French Revolution\nwith the Glorious Revolution of 1688; for Burke, it reprised 1649,\nwhen Parliament was purged and the king executed. The 1688 Revolution\ndid not affirm, like the French Revolution, that power can revert to\nthe people, who have a right to \u201cerect a new form\u2026as they\nthink good\u201d (to quote Locke\u2019s Second Treatise) (Pocock\n1989: 207).\n\nBurke argued that revolutionaries impose theory on political practice,\nwhen they should rather derive theory from it. In a speech of 1782, he\nheld it preposterous\n\n\nto take the theories which learned and speculative men have made from\nthat government, and then, supposing it made on those theories which\nwere made from it, to accuse that government as not corresponding with\nthem. (1782 House of Commons motion, in SW IV: 148)\n\n\nHe thus\n\n\nregarded as folly the Enlightenment programme of willed, abstractly\nunderwritten social reform, which violated the organic mystery of\nhistoricism, the [Aristotelian]\u2026 unfolding\nof\u2026institutional modes of social being. (Steiner 1988: 3)\n\n\nHe opposed radical rationalist philosophes, Rousseau\u2019s Romantic\nsentimentalism, and Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism, lamenting that\n\u201cthe age of chivalry is gone. That of the sophists, economists\nand calculators has succeeded\u201d (Burke, WS III: 127). He held\nagainst these calculators and rationalists that \u201cno great human\ninstitution results from deliberation\u201d, but rather, evolves in\nways not envisaged by its founders; \u201chuman works are fragile in\nproportion to\u2026the degree to which science and reasoning\u201d\nhave helped construct them (Kirk 1954: 24; Burke, WS III: 128). As\nPocock writes,\n\n\nthe reason of the living, though it might clearly enough discern the\ndisadvantages, might not fully perceive the advantages of existing and\nancient institutions; \n\n\nthere is always\n\n\nmore in laws and institutions than [meets] the eye of critical reason.\n(Pocock 1989: 203)\n\n\nBurke required close and constant attention to circumstance, for\nsociety is \u201ca dense medium\u201d, never easy to penetrate.\n(1987 [1790]: 54) \n\nIsaiah Berlin and Stuart Hampshire link Burke with reactionaries such\nas de Maistre. But to reiterate, Burke advocated organic and\nrestorative reform, not reaction:\n\n\na nation without the means of its own reform is without the means of\nits own preservation. (Burke, WS III: 327; Lock 2006: 305)\n\n\nThe Reflections argue that the ancien regime could\nhave been restored to its pre-corrupt state; summoning the Estates\nGeneral for May 1789 was an opportunity for enlightened reform of the\nmonarchy, hijacked by enthusiastic atheists and deists (WS VIII:\n175\u20136). Burke advocated \u201cslow politics\u201d, an inching\nforward on the secure foundation of inherited settlements and\nloyalties (Mount 2014).\n\nBurke had a Whig belief in limited government. He identified liberties\nand rights with landed property, hence King George III\u2019s praise\nof Reflections for supporting \u201cthe cause of the\nGentleman\u201d. Burke differs from liberal tradition not in\nrejecting rights as such, but in his conception of them (Lock 2006:\n313\u201326). He rejected a constitution or bill of rights that does\nnot simply express existing practice. For him, the only reliable\nliberty comes through descent, justified\n\n\n\u2026not on abstract principles \u201cas the rights of men\u201d,\nbut as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their\nforefathers\u2026 The idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle\nof conservation, and\u2026of transmission; without at all excluding\na principle of improvement. By a constitutional policy, working after\nthe pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we transmit our government\nand our privileges, [just as] we enjoy and transmit our property and\nour lives. (Burke, WS III: 83) \n\n\nBurke mistrusted appeals beyond positive law, but his writings on\nIndia allow, in its absence, an appeal to natural law though not\nnatural right. The Hobbesian conception of Reflections treats\nnatural rights as pre-social, and incompatible with society. For\nBurke, liberty is precarious; to say that it is assured by\nprovidential order, and has an inevitable progress, is the kind of\nmetaphysical principle he abhorred (Himmelfarb 1987: 146\u20137).\n\nBurke misrepresents the social contract of Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau\nas a rather temporary expedient,\n\n\nnothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and\ncoffee, calico, or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be\ntaken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the\nfancy of the parties. (Burke, WS III: 147)\n\n\nBut his position is genuinely distinct from theirs in crossing the\ngenerations:\n\n\n[The state] is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art;\na partnership in every virtue\u2026As [its] ends\u2026cannot be\nobtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership\u2026between\nthose who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be\nborn. Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the\ngreat primeval contract of eternal society, linking the lower with the\nhigher natures, connecting the visible and invisible world\u2026\n(Burke, WS III: 147)\n\n\nThis is a powerful statement, but hard to interpret. It is reflected\nin Chesterton\u2019s remarks that\n\n\nTradition means giving a vote to most obscure of all classes, our\nancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to\nsubmit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen\nto be walking about. All democrats object to men being disqualified by\nthe accident of birth; tradition objects to their being disqualified\nby the accident of death. Democracy tells us not to neglect a good\nman\u2019s opinion, even if he is our groom; tradition asks us not to\nneglect a good man\u2019s opinion, even if he is our father (Chesterton\n2012: 29; see also section 4 of this entry) \n\n\nHampsher-Monk comments that Burke\n\n\nsublimates the contract\u2019s ideological power whilst draining it\nof radical potential: a contract involving the dead and unborn could\nhardly be renegotiated. [This rhetorical figure] expresses his deepest\nbeliefs about the status of political establishments. Our social\ninstitutions cannot (like ordinary contracts) be the product of any\nindividual\u2019s calculation or insight (Hampsher-Monk 2012:\n202\u20133)\n\n\nFor Scruton (1980), liberals tend to make present members of society\ndominant over those who went before, and those who come after; some\nconservative commentators fear that the cross-generational contract is\nnow being broken by\n\n\nenormous inter-generational transfers [from future to present\ngenerations] implied by current fiscal policies. (Ferguson 2012)\n\n\nBurke was a Christian thinker whose conservatism has been traced to\nhis theological presuppositions (Harris 1993; Cobban 1960: 94); he saw\natheistic Jacobinism as a threat to Western cultural tradition. Many\nconservative writers share his religious interpretation of the\ncontract across the generations; for Kirk (1954: 7), established\nreligion is among the traditions that conservatives value. But\nreligious belief is not essential to conservatism, and Oakeshott was a\nsecular conservative (Cowling, 2004: xv).\n\nBurke\u2019s writings appealed to Continental as well as\nAnglo-American audiences; both Tocqueville and Macaulay were\nfollowers. But they caused a stormy reaction from radicals. Thomas\nPaine, a friend with whom Burke quarrelled, defended a cosmopolitan\nconception of rights; liberty is each person\u2019s natural right,\nwhich only the living possess, and Burke\u2019s idea of descent was a\n\u201cusurpation\u201d and diminution of it:\n\n\n[No] generation [has] a property in the generations which are to\nfollow. The parliament or the people of 1688\u2026had no more right\nto dispose of the people of the present day\u2026. (Paine 1791:\n92)\n\n\nPaine wanted the American Revolution to abolish slavery, and to\nrestrain the French Revolution from violent fanaticism; Burke,\nsympathising with Marie Antoinette, \u201cpities the plumage and\nforgets the dying bird\u201d\u2014the people (Paine 1791: 102). Mary\nWollstonecraft, in her pamphlet A Vindication of the Rights of\nMen (1790), said that\n\n\nhad you been a Frenchman, you would have been, in spite of your\nrespect for rank and antiquity, a violent revolutionist. Your\nimagination would have taken fire. (Wollstonecraft 1790: 44)\n\n\nIn his later career, liberals believed, Burke showed himself a\nprisoner of the feudal and landed conception of society.\n\nBurke\u2019s apparent change of affiliation from Whig to Tory is\nmuch-debated. For most of his career, he was regarded as a moderate\nreforming Whig, campaigning against the corruption and brutality of\nthe East India Company. Only at the end did he become the Tory scourge\nof Revolution. Indeed, Reflections is liberal compared to\nLetters on a Regicide Peace five years later, which demanded\na war abroad and repression at home to extirpate revolutionary\ninfection. The 19th century regarded him as a liberal,\ntreating his later writings as an aberration\u2014an interpretation\nreversed in the 20th century. Marx scathingly dismissed\nBurke as an opportunist:\n\n\nThe sycophant\u2014who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the\nromantic\u2026against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of\nthe North American colonies\u2026he had played the liberal against\nthe English oligarchy\u2014was an out-and-out vulgar bourgeois.\n\u201cThe laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the\nlaws of God.\u201d (E. Burke, l.c.: 31, 32)\u2026true to the laws\nof God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market (Das\nKapital, Vol. 1, Ch. 31)\n\n\nColeridge, slightly more charitably, wrote:\n\n\nIf his Opponents are Theorists, then every thing is to be founded on\nPRUDENCE, on mere calculation of EXPEDIENCY\u2026 Are his Opponents\nCalculators? Then\u2026God has given us FEELINGS, and we are to obey\nthem! (Coleridge CW, The Friend, II (first published 1809):\n123\u20136)\n\n\nFor Locke, Burke\u2019s statements are context-specific rhetorical\nacts, never intended to form a consistent system; the traditional view\nof Burke as a \u201cliberal\u201d who ended up as a\n\u201cconservative\u201d is simplistic, though his views did develop\nover time (see Lock 2006 Vol II: 306).\n\nOthers have variously attempted to reconcile the earlier and later\nBurke. Churchill argued that\n\n\nthe Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority [sought] the same\nideals of society and Government\u2026defining them from assaults,\nnow from one extreme, now from the other. (Churchill 1932:\n40\u2014like Burke, he changed party and so may have identified with\nhim)\n\n\nMacpherson argued that by Burke\u2019s time, the traditional order\nwas a capitalist one, and so his conservatism was consistent with\nfree-market liberalism; Burke advocated the Whig principles underlying\nthe Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the American Revolution of 1776,\nbut not the French Revolution (Macpherson 1980; see Burke 1987 [1790]:\n15, on how his opponents are \u201cconstantly confounding\u201d the\nrevolution of 1688, and those of 1649 and 1789). In contrast,\nO\u2019Brien in The Great Melody\u2014the title, a\nquotation from W.B. Yeats, is Burke\u2019s consistent opposition to\nabuse of power in Ireland, America, India and France\u2014argues that\nhis understanding of the American Revolution was not a radical,\nliberal one. He was always a Christian and monarchist, and his great\nspeech was entitled \u201cOn Conciliation with the Colonies\u201d;\nuntil independence was inevitable, conciliation was his aim. Cobban,\nseeing Burke as \u201cthe greatest of the followers of Locke\u201d,\ndenies that he changed his opinion fundamentally at the time of the\nFrench Revolution; rather, \u201can inconsistency runs right through\nhis thought\u201d (Cobban 1960: 40). (Pocock 1994 outlines\nBurke\u2019s conflicting commitments to English Whiggery and Irish\nCatholicism.)\n\nA fundamental question is how far the \u201cprejudice\u201d that\nBurke advocates is non-rational. Was he against reason, or just\nagainst abstract reason? Did he supplant individual with collective\nreason? For Cobban, Burke was \u201ca philosopher of unreason in the\ngreat age of Reason\u201d (Cobban 1960: 75). A subtler view is that\nfor him, individual reason cannot discern fully how social and\npolitical institutions work; it cannot see the entire process of\ncommunal adaptation, or understand by itself the principles on which\nit is based. As Hampsher-Monk puts it, institutions result from trial\nand error, embodying accumulated historical experience in\ninstitutional reason\u2014like precedent within Common Law, which\nBurke had studied. (Pocock 1989: 211ff. discusses Burke\u2019s debt\nto this tradition; he rejected legalism, and especially\u2014since he\nwas a kind of relativist\u2014the idea of the Common Law as timeless\nand immemorial.) Burke contrasted the wisdom of the law, with the\nlimited reflective reason of individuals\u2014no one person can\nreproduce in thought the complex train of experiences and decisions\nthat led the law to be what it is\u2014and he relies on the tradition\nof sceptical and conservative empiricism in English social thought,\nincluding Coke\u2019s critique of the Stuart monarchs (Pocock 1989).\nThe British and American common law system is evolutionary, not\nabstract like Roman and Napoleonic coded law. Judgment according to\nprecedent, unlike a priori codified law, is better able to\nanticipate new circumstances.\n\n\nBurke [credited] educated prejudice as an antidote to its bigoted\nforms. This did not entail a renunciation of reason, but a suspicion\nof its inordinate pretensions. (Bourke, in Dwan and Insole 2012:\n29)\n\n\nScruton echoes Burke when he argues that beliefs that appear to be\nexamples of prejudice may be useful and important; the attempt to\njustify them will merely lead to their loss. One might show prejudice\nas irrational, but there will be a loss if it is discarded (Scruton\n1980).\n\nBurke is opposed not to reason, but to the arrogance of individual\nreason, therefore:\n\n\nWe are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private\nstock of reason\u2026the stock in each man is small,\nand\u2026individuals would do better to avail themselves of the\ngeneral bank and capital of nations and of ages\u2026. Prejudice is\nof ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind\nin a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man\nhesitating in the moment of decision sceptical, puzzled, and\nunresolved. (Burke, WS III: 138)\n\n\nRejecting the dominant individualist cognitive tradition in Western\nepistemology, Burke regards political reason as historically\naccumulated in developed social institutions\u2014including an\nunwritten constitution, practices of representation, and dispositions\nnotably of compromise. According to Himmelfarb, there is for Burke\ngood reason\u2014reason itself\u2014to praise prejudice, which\nexists on a continuum with theoretical reason (Himmelfarb 2008b).\nHowever, Hampsher-Monk argues that\n\n\nBurke\u2019s fear of the inadequacies of individual reason has only\nan obscure counterpart in his belief in collective wisdom. (1992: 304)\n\n\n\nDoes Burke follows Hume\u2019s notion of custom, which may be\nregarded as irrationalist or even nihilist? For Burkean conservatives,\n\u201creason\u201d operates only relative to or within a prior\n\u201cnon-rational stabilisation of belief\u201d in habit or\nprejudice\u2014a stabilisation necessary to avoid scepticism in the\ntraditional philosophical sense. For Hume and Burke this is a\ncustomary framework; for religious thinkers such as Cardinal Newman it\nis fideistic, appealing to the extra-rational authority of religious\ndoctrine. Prejudice is normative; the inability to subsume particular\nactions under a universal law does not imply radical relativism\n(Vannatta 2014). For the classical liberal, in contrast, reason\nprecisely does not operate within customary frameworks.\n",
