    "main_text": "Systems of connexive logic || Algebraic connexive logic\n4.1 Algebraic connexive logic\n\nWhereas the basic ideas of connexive logic can be traced back to\nantiquity, the search for formal systems with connexive implication\nseems to have begun only in the 19th century in the work of H. MacColl\n(1878), see also Rahman and Redmond 2008. The basic idea of connexive\nimplication was spelled out also by E. Nelson (1930), and a more\nrecent formal study of systems of connexive logic started in the\n1960s. In McCall 1966, S. McCall presented an axiomatization of a\nsystem of propositional connexive logic semantically introduced by\nAngell (1962) in terms of certain four-valued matrices. The language\nof McCall\u2019s logic CC1 contains as primitive\n(notation adjusted) a unary connective ~ (negation) and the binary\nconnectives \u2227 (conjunction) and \u2192 (implication). Disjunction\n\u2228 and equivalence \u2194 are defined in the usual way. The\nschematic axioms and the rules of CC1 are as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nA1\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 ((B \u2192\nC) \u2192 (A \u2192 C)) \n\nA2\n((A \u2192 A) \u2192 B) \u2192\nB \n\nA3\n(A\u2192 B) \u2192 ((A \u2227\nC) \u2192 (B \u2227 C)) \n\nA4\n(A \u2227 A) \u2192 (B \u2192\nB) \n\nA5\n(A \u2227 (B \u2227 C)) \u2192\n(B \u2227 (A \u2227 C)) \n\nA6\n(A \u2227 A) \u2192 ((A \u2192\nA) \u2192 (A \u2227 A)) \n\nA7\nA \u2192 (A \u2227 (A \u2227\nA)) \n\nA8\n((A \u2192 ~B) \u2227 B) \u2192\n~A \n\nA9\n(A \u2227 ~(A \u2227 ~B)) \u2192\nB \n\nA10\n~(A \u2227 ~(A \u2227 A)) \n\nA11\n(~A \u2228 ((A \u2192 A) \u2192\nA)) \u2228 (((A \u2192 A) \u2228 (A\n\u2192 A)) \u2192 A) \n\nA12\n(A \u2192 A) \u2192 ~(A \u2192\n~A) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nR1\n\u00a0 if \u22a2 A and \u22a2 (A \u2192\nB), then \u22a2 B (modus ponens) \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\nR2\n\u00a0 if \u22a2 A and \u22a2 B, then\n\u22a2 (A \u2227 B) (adjunction)  \n\n\nAmong these axiom schemata, only A12 is contra-classical. The system\nCC1 is characterized by the following four-valued\ntruth tables with designated values 1 and 2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n\u00a0 \n\n1\n4 \n\n2\n3 \n\n3\n2 \n\n4\n1  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u2227\n1\n2\n3\n4 \n\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4 \n\n2\n2\n1\n4\n3 \n\n3\n3\n4\n3\n4 \n\n4\n4\n3\n4\n3  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u2192\n1\n2\n3\n4 \n\n1\n1\n4\n3\n4 \n\n2\n4\n1\n4\n3 \n\n3\n1\n4\n1\n4 \n\n4\n4\n1\n4\n1  \n   \n\n\nMcCall emphasizes that the logic CC1 is only one\namong many possible systems satisfying the theses of Aristotle and\nBoethius. Although CC1 is a system of\nconnexive logic, its algebraic semantics appears to be only a formal\ntool with little explanatory capacity. In CC1, the\nconstant truth functions 1, 2,\n3, and 4 can be defined as follows\n(McCall1966, p. 421): 1 := (p \u2192\np), 2 := ~(p \u2194 ~p),\n3 := (p \u2194 ~p),\n4 := ~(p\u2192 p), for some\nsentence letter p. As Routley and Montgomery (1968, p. 95)\npoint out, CC1 \u201ccan be given a semantics by\nassociating the matrix value 1 with logical necessity, value 4 with\nlogical impossibility, value 2 with contingent truth, and value 3 with\ncontingent falsehood. However, many anomalies result; e.g. the\nconjunction of two contingent truths yields a necessary truth\u201d.\nMoreover, McCall points out that CC1 has some\nproperties that are difficult to justify if the name \u2018connexive\nlogic\u2019 is meant to reflect the fact that in a valid implication\nA \u2192 B there exists some form of connection\nbetween the antecedent A and the succedent B. Axiom\nA4, for example, is bad in this respect. On the other hand,\nCC1 might be said to undergenerate, since (A\n\u2227 A) \u2192 A and A \u2192 (A\n\u2227 A) fail to be theorems of CC1. Routley\nand Montgomery (1968) showed that the addition of the latter formulas\nto only a certain subsystem of CC1 leads to\ninconsistency. For a defense of Angell\u2019s PA1\nagainst Routley and Montgomery\u2019s critical observations see Bode\n1979.\n\nThese observations may well have distracted many non-classical\nlogicians from connexive logic at that time. If the validity of\nAristotle\u2019s and Boethius\u2019 Theses is distinctive of\nconnexive logics, it is, however, not quite clear how damaging the\nabove criticism is. In order to construct a more satisfactory system\nof connexive logic, McCall (1975) defined the notions of a connexive\nalgebra and a connexive model and presented an axiom system\nCFL that is characterized by the class of all\nconnexive models. In the language of CFL, however,\nevery implication is first-degree, i.e., no nesting of \u2192 is\npermitted. McCall refers to a result by R. Meyer showing that the\nvalid implications of CFL form a subset of the set of\nvalid material equivalences and briefly discusses giving up the\nsyntactic restriction to first-degree implication. Meyer (1977) showed\nthat the first-degree fragment of the normal modal logic\nS5 (and in fact every normal modal logic between\nKT and S5, cf. the entry\n logic: modal)\n and CFL are equivalent in the following sense: all\ntheorems of CFL are provable in S5\nif the connexive implication A \u2192 B is defined\nas \u25a1(A \u2283 B) \u2227 (A \u2261\nB), where \u2283 and \u2261 are classical implication and\nequivalence, respectively, and every first-degree theorem of\nS5 is provable in CFL if\n\u25a1A (\u201cit is necessary that A\u201d) is\ndefined as (~p \u2228 p)\u2192A. In summary,\nit seems fair to say that as the result of the investigations into\nconnexive logic in the 1960s and 1970s, connexive logic, its ancient\nroots notwithstanding, appeared as a sort of exotic branch of\nnon-classical logic.\n\nMore recently, Cantwell (2008) presented a truth table semantics for a\nsystem of connexive logic together with a proof-theoretical\ncharacterization. The truth tables for negation and implication are\ntaken from Belnap 1970, but Cantwell's three-valued truth table for\nthe conditional can already be found in a paper by William Cooper\n(1968). Like Cantwell, Cooper wanted to formally model how conditional\nsentences in the indicative mood and expressed by means of\nif-then are used in ordinary conversational English. (Whereas\nCantwell takes the entire three-element set of truth values as the\nco-domain of assignment functions for propositional variables, Cooper\nrestricts assignment functions to mappings from the set of\npropositional variables to the two-element set of classical truth\nvalues.) Cantwell considers a language containing the constantly false\nproposition \u22a5 and the following three-valued truth tables for\nnegation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication with designated\nvalues T and \u2212 (where \u2018T\u2019 stands for truth and\n\u2018F\u2019 for falsity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n\u00a0 \n\nT\nF \n\nF\nT \n\n\u2212\n\u2212  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u2227\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\nT\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\nF\nF\nF\nF \n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nF\n\u2212  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2228\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\nT\nT\nT\nT \n\nF\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\n\u2212\nT\n\u2212\n\u2212  \n \n\n\n\n\n\u2192\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\nT\nT\nF\n\u2212 \n\nF\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \n\n\u2212\nT\nF\n\u2212  \n   \n\n\nIn this system, introduced as a system of conditional negation,\nCN, (A \u2192 ~B) and ~(A\n\u2192 B) have the same value under every assignment of truth\nvalues to propositional variables. Cantwell\u2019s system thus\nvalidates BTe and BTe\u2032, and it turns out to be the connexive\nlogic MC from Wansing 2005, see section 4.5.3,\nextended by the Law of Excluded Middle, A \u2228 ~A. A\ncertain expansion of CN is studied in Olkhovikov\n2002, 2016 and, independently, in Omori 2016c, see section 4.5.3.\n\nA three-valued logic that validates Aristotle\u2019s theses but not\nBoethius\u2019 theses and that is subminimally connexive and Kapsner\nstrong in the terminology of Estrada-Gonz\u00e1lez &\nRamirez-C\u00e1mara 2016 is the three-valued logic\nMRSP that was introduced in\nEstrada-Gonz\u00e1lez 2008. In Estrada-Gonz\u00e1lez &\nRamirez-C\u00e1mara 2016, MRSP is\ndiscussed against the background of Cantwell\u2019s three-valued\nconnexive logic CN and Mortensen\u2019s (1984)\nthree-valued connexive logic, dubbed M3V by McCall\n(2012).\n\nMcCall (2014) presents a cut-free sequent calculus for a system of\nconnexive logic that he calls \u201cconnexive Gentzen.\u201d The\ncalculus has the non-standard feature of using pairs of axioms that\nare not logical truths. An annotation with subscripts is used to\nenable the elimination of dependencies on such non-standard axioms in\nthe course of a derivation. The resulting system differs from\nCC1 in that p \u2192 (p \u2227\np) and (p \u2227 p)\u2192 p are\nprovable, and it is shown to be sound with respect to certain\nfour-valued matrices. Sound and complete cut-free sequent calculi for\ncertain constructive and modal connexive logics have been presented\nfor the first time in Wansing 2008 and Kamide and Wansing 2011.\n",
