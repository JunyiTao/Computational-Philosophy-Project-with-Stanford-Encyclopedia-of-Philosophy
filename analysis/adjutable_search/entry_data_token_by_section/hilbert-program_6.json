    "main_text": "The Finitary Point of View || Finitarily meaningful propositions and finitary reasoning\n2.2 Finitarily meaningful propositions and finitary reasoning\n\nThe most basic judgments about finitary numerals are those about\nequality and inequality. In addition, the finite standpoint allows\noperations on finitary objects. Here the most basic is that of\nconcatenation. The concatenation of the numerals 11 and 111 is\ncommunicated as \u201c\\(2 + 3\\),\u201d and the statement that 11\nconcatenated with 111 results in the same numeral as 111 concatenated\nwith 11 by \u201c\\(2 + 3 = 3 + 2\\).\u201d In actual proof-theoretic\npractice, as well as explicitly in\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1934;\n Bernays, 1930), these basic operations \nare generalized to operations\ndefined by recursion, paradigmatically, primitive recursion, e.g.,\nmultiplication and exponentiation (see\n Parsons 1998\n for philosophical difficulties in relation to exponentiation and\n 2007\n for an extended discussion of intuitive mathematics and finitism).\nSimilarly, finitary judgments may involve not just equality or\ninequality but also basic decidable properties, such as \u201cis a\nprime.\u201d This is finitarily acceptable as long as the\ncharacteristic function of such a property is itself finitary: For\ninstance, the operation which transforms a numeral to 1 if it is prime\nand 11 otherwise can be defined by primitive recursion and is hence\nfinitary. Such finitary propositions may be combined by the usual\nlogical operations of conjunction, disjunction, negation, but also\nbounded quantification.\n (Hilbert, 1926)\n gives the example of the proposition that \u201cthere is a prime\nnumber between \\(p + 1\\) and \\(p! + 1\\)\u201d where \\(p\\) is a\ncertain large prime. This statement is finitarily acceptable since it\n\u201cserves merely to abbreviate the proposition\u201d that either\n\\(p + 1\\) or \\(p + 2\\) or \\(p + 3\\) or \u2026 or \\(p! + 1\\) is a\nprime.\n\nThe problematic finitary propositions are those that express general\nfacts about numerals such as that, for any given numeral \\(n, 1+n =\nn+1\\). It is problematic because, as Hilbert puts it, it \u201cis\nfrom the finitist point of view incapable of being\nnegated\u201d\n (1926,\n 378). By this he means that the contradictory proposition that there\nis a numeral \\(n\\) for which \\(1+n \\ne n+1\\) is not finitarily\nmeaningful. \u201cOne cannot, after all, try out all numbers\u201d\n (1928,\n 470). For the same reason, a finitary general proposition is not to\nbe understood as an infinite conjunction but \u201conly as a\nhypothetical judgment that comes to assert something when a numeral is\ngiven\u201d (ibid.). Even though they are problematic in this sense,\ngeneral finitary statements are of particular importance to\nHilbert\u2019s proof theory, since the statement of consistency of a\nformal system \\(S\\) is of such a general form: for any given sequence\nof formulas \\(P, P\\) is not a derivation of a contradiction in\n\\(S\\).\n",
