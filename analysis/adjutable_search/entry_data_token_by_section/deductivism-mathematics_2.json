    "main_text": "Historical Accounts\n3. Historical Accounts\n\nThis section covers four historical accounts of deductivism, advocated\nby Russell\n (\u00a73.1),\n Hilbert\n (\u00a73.2),\n Pasch\n (\u00a73.3),\n and Curry\n (\u00a73.4)\n respectively. The first three are pre-G\u00f6delian; the fourth is a\npost-G\u00f6delian attempt to defend deductivism.\n\nAttributing deductivism to older authors is harder than it may\ninitially appear, and the existing literature offers no attempts to do\nso in a comparative way. The difficulty is owed to several conflating\nfactors. The main one is that, before G\u00f6del, there was no clear\ndistinction between semantic and syntactic consequence. And\nterminological confusion does not help: Curry, for example, refers to\nhis deductivism as \u201cformalism\u201d, a label usually reserved\nfor a different position. This article thus focuses on classifying\nauthors\u2019 substantive claims. A comparison with Brouwer\n (\u00a73.5),\n who emphasised proof in mathematics but was no deductivist, will also\nbe relevant.\n",
