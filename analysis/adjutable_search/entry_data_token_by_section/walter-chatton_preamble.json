    "main_text": "\n\nWalter Chatton or more rarely \u201cCatton\u201d (c.\n1290\u20131343) was an English theologian and philosopher who trained\nat Oxford around the same time as his famous colleague and frequent\nphilosophical target, William of Ockham. More inclined to speculative\nmetaphysics and less skeptical of reason than Ockham, Chatton was one\nof the most energetic and gifted critics of the influential brand of\nnominalism which arose in early fourteenth-century England around\nOckham. As a constructive philosopher, Chatton was not a\nsystem-builder, but a defender of certain parts of the more systematic\nphilosophy of John Duns Scotus, and an advocate of perspectivist\naccounts of cognition. Historically he is an interesting figure\nbecause he combined the realist tendencies of Scotism with the\nappreciation of logic and language we see in Ockham; thus it is common\nto find Chatton defending Scotistic theses and criticizing Ockham\nusing the same sorts of semantic ideas that Ockham himself\npopularized. His unyielding attacks on Ockham bore him fruit\nintellectually and otherwise: we have evidence of Ockham changing his\nmind on several seminal issues as a direct result of Chatton\u2019s\ncritiques. Moreover, he seems to have built a very successful\necclesiastical career, no doubt based in part on his cleverness; he\nserved as an advisor to two popes, and earned for himself, but did not\nlive long enough to enjoy, a bishopric in Wales. His stature as a\ntheologian rose high enough in his lifetime that his opinions on\nsacramental efficacy were remembered and cited at the Council of\nTrent, two hundred years after his death.\n\nAlthough his importance has long been known to Ockham specialists,\ncomplete critical editions of his work have only recently become\navailable, and detailed scholarly analysis of his views, influence,\nand intellectual life are in a nascent stage. Consequently, this\narticle will not summarize his positions under broad, modern headings\nsuch as \u2018metaphysics\u2019, \u2018epistemology\u2019, etc.,\nbut will rather present exposition and analysis of his contributions\nto several narrower problems which remain philosophically viable\ntoday.\n",
