    "main_text": "Indian Concepts of Nature || Naturalism about Self and Consciousness\n2.5 Naturalism about Self and Consciousness\n\nIndian philosophers of Mind/Self and Consciousness are of naturalist\npersuasion. Most systems subscribe to soft naturalism except the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka and the Advaita Ved\u0101nta. Regarding mind and\nconsciousness, too, the materialist C\u0101rv\u0101ka-s are hard\nnaturalists and the spiritualist Advaitins are non-naturalists.\nHowever, naturalists and non-naturalists alike approach mentalistic\nconcepts on the basis of our lived experience. That is, they theorize\non these concepts at the person-level using the vocabulary eminently\nsuitable for expressing human experiences. Hence subjective phenomena\nfall squarely within the Space of Reason. Pluralist schools, viz., the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s, the Jaina-s, the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\naccommodate mind, body, consciousness and emotions within nature\nwithout much problem because they construe nature rather widely. They\ndo not think that nature is homogeneous as it is constituted by the\nmaterial elements and their properties. Consequently Indian theorists\nare not bugged by the problems of interactionism and reductionism. Let\nme explain this point in brief. Whoever placed mind and consciousness\nin one realm and body and brain in a different realm failed to account\nfor causal interaction amongst conscious mind and extended body, a\nphenomenon we commonly experience in our everyday life. Besides,\ndenial of a pluralist ontology and adopting a particular kind of\nscientific explanation underlie reductionism and its associated\nproblems. If different kinds of entities could be accommodated in\nnature and the model of scientific explanation adopted in the wake of\nthe unification of science program could be given up then the\nreductive tendencies (metaphysical, doctrinal and theoretical\nreduction) could be kept in check.\n\nIn the Upani\u1e63ads, the Ultimate Reality or Brahman had\nbeen identified with the inner essence of an individual being or\n\u0100tman. At the beginning there was only One, the essence\nof which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. That One desired to be many\nand this world of multifarious object was created. Having created the\nworld Brahman entered into it. Hence It is both transcendent\nof and immanent in Its creations. Classical followers of the\nUpani\u1e63adic view are divided on this point. \u015aankara\nmaintained that Brahman is transcendent and the world is an illusory\ntransformation of the Brahman projected by its power called\nM\u0101y\u0101. Brahman therefore stands apart from Nature. Apparently\n\u015aankara and his followers are non-naturalists. Other major\nschools of Vedanta propounded respectively by R\u0101m\u0101nuja\n(Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita), M\u0101dhva\n(Bhed\u0101dvaita), Nimb\u0101rka and Bh\u0101skara\n(Bhed\u0101bheda-v\u0101da), Vallabha\n(\u015auddh\u0101dvaita), Sri Caitanya\n(Acintyabhed\u0101bheda-v\u0101da) \u2013 all upheld\nthat the world is an evolution of the Brahman. In empirical\nlife existence, consciousness and enjoyment of an individual is\nconstrained by his/her body, though the final aim of individual life\nis to dissociate itself from its body and merge with the Ultimate\nReality having realized his/her own essential nature. Ved\u0101ntins,\neven Advaitins, thus, explain and justify all lived human experience,\nhence tilt towards relaxed naturalism. \n\nThe materialist C\u0101rv\u0101ka-s maintain that consciousness\nemerges from the four basic material elements \u2013 earth, water,\nfire and air combined in the right proportion, though none of these\nmaterial elements possesses consciousness. It is like emergence of red\ncolour from the chewing of beetle-nut and certain other ingredients,\nnone of which contains red colour; or like emergence of water from\nhydrogen and oxygen molecules. Consciousness, according to the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka-s, is a quality of the body and self to them is\nnothing but a conscious body. Major interpreters of the\nC\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophy brand this emergentist view as\nreductionist. but Ganeri (2012) sees a possibility of interpreting\nthis view as a kind of non-reductive supervenience which entails that\n\u2018a full inventory of reality must include both the supervenience\nbase and all that is emergent, irreducibly supervenient, upon\nit\u2019 (pp.30\u201331). \n\nAs opposed to the C\u0101rv\u0101ka-s and the Ved\u0101ntins, the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s, maintain that consciousness is a\nnon-essential adventitious quality (\u0101gantuka-gu\u1e47a)\nof the self because consciousness is present in the self only during\nits embodied existence. In their metaphysics, they enumerated\ndifferent kinds of entities, viz. soul/self (\u0101tm\u0101),\nbody (\u015bar\u012bra), sense organs (indriya),\nobjects of experience (artha), knowledge (budhhi),\ninner sense (manas), etc. A summary account of these\nmetaphysical entities shows that all these kinds of knowable objects\nare inter-related. Here, \u0101tm\u0101 is the seer of all\nthings, enjoyer of all things, knows and experiences. Body is the site\nof all sorts of experiences including enjoyment and suffering. The\nsense organs are the means of knowledge as well as enjoyment.\nManas is the internal sense organ with the help of which we\nintrospect our inner states. Volition (prav\u1e5btti) is\nthat which leads to physical and mental acts. Affection, aversion and\nstupidity are listed as faults (do\u1e63a-s). Transmigration\n(pretyabh\u0101ba) means the series of births and deaths\nthrough which an individual soul travels until attaining liberation.\nBirth means connection of a soul with body, senses and so forth; death\nmeans their dissociation. Consequences of activities are mainly of two\ntypes: pleasure and pain. This is the Ny\u0101ya account of all\npossible experiences of soul. The means of release from the cycle of\nlife and death is the correct knowledge of different types of entities\nwhich enables one to distinguish between self from not-self. This\nparaphrase from the first commentary (bh\u0101\u1e63ya) of the oldest\nNy\u0101ya treatise makes it evident that if the excellence of an\nindividual lies in its knowledge, its sentience, its attempt to avoid\npainful existence \u2013 it cannot be an abstract essence \u2013 a\nsoul minus its bodily entrapments. It has to be a self-body continuum\nimmersed and engaged in meaningful pursuits of life in its journey\ntowards emancipation \u2013 towards absolute cessation of all\nsufferings. Self, according to this school, cannot be individuated\nwithout a body and hence this view is again a version of liberal\nnaturalism guaranteeing causality without over-determination among\ndifferent kinds of entities material and non-material. \n\nIn the teachings of the Buddha, which is available in the\nNik\u0101ya-s, consciousness is described as one link in the\ntwelve-link-causal chain\n(dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101nga-bhavacakra) that is responsible\nfor the birth and bondage of human beings. Consciousness is the link\nbetween the past and the present. It arises out of ignorance\n(avidy\u0101) and mental formations (karma) and\ngives rise to name and form (n\u0101ma-r\u016bpa), i.e., the\npsycho-physical constituents of a person in bondage. One should\nremember that each of the twelve links in the bhava-cakra is\nboth conditioned and that which conditions. One\u2019s consciousness\nis conditioned not only by what one experiences in this world but also\nby the way one reacts to these experiences. If a person realizes that\npleasurable experiences of this world are all temporary then he can\ncontrol his cravings and the chain will snap ultimately leading to his\nliberation. On the other hand, if he craves for and clings to\napparently pleasurable experiences, that will lead him to future\nbirths and the wheel of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra goes on and on for\nhim with all its associated pains. The Buddha thus with his doctrine\nof dependent origination (prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da)\nexplains the nature of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra  and of the\nI-consciousness, though he never admitted a permanent Self.\nI-consciousness, says the Buddha, is a collection of five-fold\naggregates (pa\u1fc6ca-skandha-sam\u0101h\u0101ra). The\naggregates are of matter (r\u016bpa), sensation\n(vedan\u0101), perception (sanj\u1fc6\u0101),\ndispositions (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) and consciousness\n(vij\u1fc6\u0101na). Consciousness is of six kinds \u2013\nvisual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactual/bodily and mental.\nCorresponding to each consciousness there is a dedicated\nobject-structure, viz, visible forms correspond to eye-consciousnes,\nsound to ear-consciousness, odour to nose-consciousness, taste to\ntongue-consciousness, tangible things to body-consciousness and ideas\nto mind-consciousness. Consciousness in Early Buddhism stands for a\nsimple awareness of the presence of an object. This view of the mental\ncan be branded as liberal naturalism on two grounds, (a) both material\nand non-material elements of nature can causally interact and (b) all\nexperiences of an individual in his empirical journey are explainable\nwith reference to \u2018the space of reasons\u2019.\n",
