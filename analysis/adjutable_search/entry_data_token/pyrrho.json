This later Pyrrhonism was one of the two major traditions of\nsceptical thought in the Greco-Roman world (the other being located in\nPlato\u2019s Academy during much of the Hellenistic period). Perhaps\nthe central question about Pyrrho is whether or to what extent he\nhimself was a sceptic in the later Pyrrhonist mold. The later\nPyrrhonists claimed inspiration from him; and, as we shall see, there\nis undeniably some basis for this. But it does not follow that\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy was identical to that of this later\nmovement, or even that the later Pyrrhonists thought that it was\nidentical; the claims of indebtedness that are expressed by or\nattributed to members of the later Pyrrhonist tradition are broad and\ngeneral in character (and in Sextus Empiricus\u2019 case notably\ncautious\u2014see Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.7), and do not in\nthemselves point to any particular reconstruction of Pyrrho\u2019s\nthought. It is necessary, therefore, to focus on the meager evidence\nbearing explicitly upon Pyrrho\u2019s own ideas and attitudes. How we\nread this evidence will also, of course, affect our conception of\nPyrrho\u2019s relations with his own philosophical contemporaries and\npredecessors.\n", "toc": [{"#Lif": "1.

Life\n\nPyrrho appears to have lived from around 365\u2013360 BCE until\naround 275\u2013270 BCE (for the evidence see von Fritz (1963), 90).\nWe have several reports of philosophers from whom he learned, the most\nsignificant (and the most reliable) of which concern his association\nwith Anaxarchus of Abdera. Alongside Anaxarchus (and several other\nphilosophers) he allegedly accompanied Alexander the Great on his\nexpedition to India. We are told that in the course of this expedition\nhe encountered some \u201cnaked wise men\u201d\n(gumnosophistai); Diogenes Laertius (9.61) claims that his\nphilosophy developed as a result of this meeting, but it is not clear\nwhat basis, if any, he has for this assertion. In any case, after his\nreturn to Greece Pyrrho did espouse a philosophy that attracted\nnumerous followers, of whom the most important was Timon of Phlius.\nThe travel writer Pausanias reports (6.24.5) seeing a statue of him in\nthe marketplace in Pyrrho\u2019s home town of Elis in the\nPeloponnese; Diogenes also reports (9.64) that he was made high\npriest, and that in his honor philosophers were made exempt from city\ntaxation. While Pausanias\u2019 report is easier to accept at face\nvalue than Diogenes\u2019, both suggest that (at least locally) he\nachieved considerable celebrity. However, there is no good reason to\nbelieve that a Pyrrhonist \u2018movement\u2019 continued beyond his\nown immediate followers; it was not until the first century BCE that\nPyrrhonism became the name of an ongoing philosophical tradition.\n2. Ancient Sources and the Nature of the Evidence\n\nWith the exception of poetry allegedly written while on\nAlexander\u2019s expedition (which, as far as we can tell, did not\nsurvive that expedition), Pyrrho wrote nothing; we are therefore\nobliged to try to reconstruct his philosophy from reports by others.\nUnfortunately the reports that we have are fragmentary and, in many\ncases, of doubtful reliability. Pyrrho\u2019s follower Timon wrote\nnumerous poems and prose works; but of these only fragments and in\nsome cases second-hand reports survive. It is likely that much of what\nwe hear about Pyrrho in later sources also derives indirectly from\nTimon, but it is frequently not possible to judge, in individual\ncases, whether or not this is so. Other difficulties concerning\nTimon\u2019s evidence are, first, that he writes as a devotee rather\nthan as a neutral reporter, and second, that the great majority of\nTimon\u2019s fragments derive from a poem called Silloi\n(Lampoons), and consist of satirical thumbnail sketches of\nother philosophers rather than any kind of direct exposition of\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook. (See the entry on Timon, section 2, for\ndetails.) Nevertheless, Timon is clearly the most important and\nthe most trustworthy source of information about Pyrrho. Of the\nevidence from Timon, one piece looks to be especially important.\nThis is a summary, by the Peripatetic Aristocles of Messene (late 1st\nc. BCE), of an account by Timon of what appear to\nbe Pyrrho\u2019s most general philosophical attitudes. It is\nwidely agreed that this passage must be the centerpiece of any\ninterpretation of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy. However, its usefulness\nfor this purpose depends in part on how much of it is actually talking\nabout Pyrrho\u2019s attitudes, as opposed to Timon\u2019s own\ndevelopments or expansions of them. As we shall see, this is one of\nmany difficulties in interpreting the passage.\n\nWith the exception of a very few snippets of information, the only\nother source of evidence on Pyrrho that is close to contemporary is\nAntigonus of Carystus, a biographer of the mid-third century BCE.\nDiogenes Laertius, whose life of Pyrrho is our major source of\nbiographical anecdotes, frequently cites Antigonus, and is probably\nindebted to him in many places even when he does not cite him;\nAntigonus is also mentioned by Aristocles, and is likely to be the\norigin of much or even most of the surviving biographical material on\nPyrrho. But Antigonus needs to be handled even more carefully than\nTimon. He was not a philosopher, and there is no reason to think that\nhe was capable of or particularly interested in comprehending\nphilosophical nuances. Nor is it clear that accuracy was high on his\nlist of priorities; on the contrary, what we know about him suggests\nthat he was a purveyor of sensationalist gossip rather than a reliable\nhistorian. His account probably did contain genuine information about\nPyrrho\u2019s demeanor and activities; but it would certainly be\nunwise to take his anecdotes as a group on trust.\n\nCicero refers to Pyrrho about ten times, and Cicero is, in general, a\nresponsible reporter of other people\u2019s views. Unfortunately his\ninformation about Pyrrho appears to be very incomplete, and, as we\nshall see, the impression he conveys of him may very well be\ninaccurate. With one exception, he never mentions him except in\nconjunction with the famously non-orthodox Stoics Aristo and\n(sometimes) Herillus, and the remarks in question always concern the\nsame one or two points in ethics; it looks as if his knowledge of\nPyrrho derives almost entirely from a single source that conveyed\nlittle or nothing about Pyrrho individually. In addition, a number of\nauthors in later antiquity make isolated comments about Pyrrho. But\nsince these comments postdate the rise of the later Pyrrhonist\nmovement, there is often room for suspicion as to whether they reflect\ngenuine information about Pyrrho himself, as opposed to the later\nphilosophy that took his name.\n\nEven given the difficulty referred to above, any attempt to interpret\nPyrrho\u2019s philosophy must pay close attention to the summary of\nTimon in Aristocles. If the entire passage is summarizing the\nviews of Pyrrho (as Timon understood them), it clearly takes\nprecedence, in detail and trustworthiness, over the remaining\nevidence \u2014 pace Green (2017), who proposes a more holistic\napproach. If, on the other hand, much of the passage conveys the views\nof Timon, and only part of it the views of Pyrrho, the holistic\napproach has more to recommend it, despite the paucity of the\nremaining evidence. Even on this assumption, however, the Aristocles\npassage remains as important as anything else, and to this we now\nturn.\n3. The Aristocles Passage\n\nA word, first, about the provenance and evidential value of the\nAristocles passage. Several chapters from book 8 of Aristocles\u2019\nPeri philosophias (On Philosophy) appear in\nquotation in the Praeparatio evangelica of Eusebius, the\nfourth-century bishop of Caesarea. These chapters expound, and then\nattack from an Aristotelian perspective, a number of philosophies that\nimpugn the reliability of one or other of our cognitive faculties.\nAmong these Aristocles counts Pyrrhonism, as represented by Pyrrho\nhimself and by the initiator of the later Pyrrhonist tradition,\nAenesidemus; Aristocles speaks of Aenesidemus (first century BCE,\nq.v.), as recent, and is apparently not aware of any subsequent\nmembers of the Pyrrhonist tradition. The chapter on Pyrrhonism opens\nwith a brief summary of the early Pyrrhonist outlook, as reported by\nTimon, who refers to Pyrrho (14.18.1\u20135).\n\nThis convoluted transmission might lead one to doubt how much\nauthentic information can be extracted from the passage. But there is\nno reason, first, to doubt Eusebius\u2019 explicit claim to be\nquoting Aristocles verbatim. Aristocles is not quoting Timon verbatim;\nsome of the vocabulary in this passage is clearly reminiscent of\nAristocles\u2019 own vocabulary in other chapters. However, other\nterms in the passage are quite distinct both from Aristocles\u2019\nown normal usage and from any of the terminology familiar to us from\nlater Pyrrhonism, yet were in use prior to Timon\u2019s day; it seems\neasiest to account for these as authentic reproductions of\nTimon\u2019s own language. In addition, the frequent mention of Timon\neither by name or by the word ph\u00easi, \u2018he\nsays\u2019, suggests that Aristocles is taking pains to reproduce the\nessentials of his account as faithfully as possible. And finally,\nAristocles\u2019 other chapters, where we are in a position to check\nhis summaries against other evidence of the views being summarized,\nsuggest that he is in general a reliable reporter of other\npeople\u2019s views, even views to which he himself is strongly\nopposed\u2014or at least, that he is reliable when he has access to\nsystematic written expositions of those views, as seems to be the case\nhere. As for Timon\u2019s reliability as a source for Pyrrho\u2019s\nviews, we cannot be sure, but we cannot do better; he is clearly\ncloser to Pyrrho than any other source who discusses him.\nHowever, as already noted, there is a further question concerning how\nfar the passage is a report of Pyrrho\u2019s ideas and how far it gives\nus Timon\u2019s creative development of them.\n\nEven aside from that question, the interpretation of the\nAristocles passage is fraught with controversy. It follows that the\ncharacter of Pyrrho\u2019s thinking is, at its very core, a matter\nfor sharp disagreement. The present survey will begin by assuming that\nthe passage is all about Pyrrho, laying out the two main\nalternatives (given this assumption) and exploring the\nconsequences of each. (Numerous other readings besides these two have\nbeen proposed; in particular, the interpretation of Svavarsson (2004)\nis an intriguing, though arguably unstable, hybrid of the two. But it\nis fair to say that these two are the ones that have commanded by far\nthe most scholarly attention.) It will then explain why some scholars\nhave questioned this assumption, and what difference this would\nmake to our understanding of Pyrrho and of Timon\u2019s\nrelation to him. First, then, on the assumption that the whole\npassage is Timon\u2019s summary of Pyrrho\u2019s thought:\n\nTimon is reported as telling us that in order to be happy, one must\npay attention to three connected questions: first, what are things\nlike by nature? second, how should we be disposed towards things\n(given our answer to the first question)? and third, what will be the\noutcome for those who adopt the disposition recommended in the answer\nto the second question? And the passage then gives us answers to\neach of the three questions in order.\n\nThe answer to the question \u201cwhat are things like by\nnature?\u201d is given by a sequence of three epithets; things are\nsaid to be adiaphora and astathm\u00eata and\nanepikrita. Taken by themselves, these epithets can be\nunderstood in two importantly different ways: they may be taken as\ncharacterizing how things are (by nature) in themselves, or they may\nbe taken as commenting on human beings\u2019 lack (by our nature) of\ncognitive access to things. Adiaphora is normally translated\n\u2018indifferent\u2019. But this might be taken as referring either\nto an intrinsic characteristic of things\u2014namely that, in\nthemselves and by nature, they possess no differentiating features\n\u2014 or to our natural inability to discern any such features. In\nthe latter case \u2018undifferentiable\u2019 might be a more\nperspicuous translation. (Beckwith (2011) plausibly connects the focus\non differentiating features, or the lack of them, with the\nAristotelian notion of differentiae; on either of the readings to be\nexplored, Aristotle\u2019s picture of the world and of our ability to\nunderstand it would indeed be a prime example of the kind of view from\nwhich Pyrrho is anxious to distance himself.) Similarly,\nastathm\u00eata might mean \u2018unstable\u2019 or\n\u2018unbalanced\u2019, describing an objective property of things;\nor it might mean \u2018not subject to being placed on a\nbalance\u2019, and hence \u2018unmeasurable\u2019, which would\nagain place the focus on our cognitive inabilities. And\nanepikrita might mean \u2018indeterminate\u2019, referring\nto an objective lack of any definite features, or\n\u2018indeterminable\u2019, pointing to an inability on our part to\ndetermine the features of things. The statement as a whole, then, is\neither answering the question \u201cwhat are things like by\nnature?\u201d by stating that things are, in their very nature,\nindefinite or indeterminate in various ways \u2014 the precise nature\nof the thesis would be a matter for further speculation\u2014or by\nstating that we human beings are not in a position to pin down or\ndetermine the nature of things. Let us call these the metaphysical and\nthe epistemological interpretations respectively.\n\nIt is clear that the metaphysical interpretation gives us a Pyrrho who\nis not in any recognizable sense a sceptic. Pyrrho, on this\ninterpretation, is issuing a declaration about the nature of things in\nthemselves\u2014precisely what the later Pyrrhonists who called\nthemselves sceptics were careful to avoid. On the epistemological\ninterpretation, on the other hand, Pyrrho is very much closer to the\ntradition that took his name. There is still some distance between\nthem. To say that we cannot determine the nature of things\n\u2014 as opposed to saying that we have so far failed to determine\nthe natural features of things\u2014is already a departure from the\nsceptical suspension of judgement promoted by Sextus Empiricus. And to\nput it, as on this reading Pyrrho does put it, by saying that\nthings are indeterminable, is a further departure, in that it\ndoes attribute at least one feature to things in themselves \u2014\nnamely, being such that humans cannot determine them. Nevertheless,\nthe epistemological interpretation clearly portrays Pyrrho as a\nforerunner\u2014a naive and unsophisticated forerunner, perhaps\n\u2014 of later Pyrrhonist scepticism, whereas the metaphysical\ninterpretation puts him in a substantially different light.\n\nThe natural way to try to choose between these two interpretations is\nto see which of them fits best with the logic of the passage as a\nwhole. Unfortunately, a neutral decision on this does not seem be\npossible. According to the manuscripts, the phrase that\nfollows the words we have been discussing reads \u201cfor\nthis reason (dia touto) neither our sensations nor our\nopinions tell the truth or lie\u201d. On the metaphysical\ninterpretation, the idea would be that, since things are in\ntheir real nature indeterminate, our sensations and opinions, which\nrepresent things as having certain determinate features, are neither\ntrue nor false. They are not true, since reality is not the way they\npresent it as being. It might then seem that they are false. But\nif reality is indeterminate because it is constantly changing\n(as the sensible world is sometimes portrayed, for example, in Plato),\nthen one might say that our perceptions of the fleeting, temporary\nfeatures of things are not simply false. Because these\nfeatures are temporary and fleeting, they do not belong to the real\nnature of things, so the perceptions do not qualify as\ntrue; but (assuming our senses are functioning normally) they are\nfeatures the things do actually manifest on particular occasions.\n\nAs for the epistemological interpretation, some scholars have\nsuggested that the manuscripts are in error at this point, and that\nwhat the text should say is \u201con account of the fact\nthat (dia to) neither our sensations nor our opinions\ntell the truth or lie\u201d. The change is justified on linguistic\ngrounds; it is alleged that the text in the manuscripts as they stand\nis not acceptable Greek. The considerations for and against this\nproposal are technical, and debate has yielded no consensus on this\nquestion. However, it is clear that if one does make this small\nalteration to the text, the direction of the inference is reversed;\nthe point about our sensations and opinions now becomes a reason for\nthe point about the nature of things, not an inference from it. And\nthis, it has been argued, points towards the epistemological\ninterpretation. The idea would then be that, since our sensations and\nopinions fail to be consistent deliverers of true reports (or, for\nthat matter, false reports) about the world around us, there is no\nprospect of our being able to determine the nature of things. However,\neven if we retain the manuscript text, the epistemological reading may\nstill be possible (so Green (2017)). The idea would be that, in order\nfor our sensations and opinions to tell the truth or lie, they would\nhave to do two things: 1) present an appearance of things and 2)\npresent this appearance as how things really are. But since\nwe are not able to determine the latter (as we were just told in the\nstatement about the nature of things), our sensations and opinions\ncannot do this; they can only register appearances, and that is not\nenough for them to tell either truths or falsehoods.\n\nThe immediate inference from the statement about the nature of things,\nthen, is not decisive. And the remainder of the Aristocles\npassage can be also read so as to fit with either the\nmetaphysical or the epistemological reading of his answer to the\nquestion about the nature of things. The Aristocles passage continues\nwith the answer to the second question, namely the question of the\nattitude we should adopt given the answer to the first question. We\nare told, first, that we should not trust our sensations and opinions,\nbut should adopt an unopinionated attitude. On the epistemological\nreading, the significance of this is obvious. But on the metaphysical\nreading, too, we have already been told that our sensations and\nopinions are not true, which is presumably reason enough for us not to\ntrust them; and the unopinionated attitude that is here recommended\nmay be understood as one in which one refrains from positing any\ndefinite characteristics as inherent in the nature of\nthings\u2014given that their real nature is wholly indefinite. (To\nthe objection that this thesis of indefiniteness is itself an opinion,\nit may be replied that doxa, \u2018opinion\u2019, is\nregularly used in earlier Greek philosophy, especially in Parmenides\nand Plato, to refer to those opinions\u2014misguided opinions, in the\nview of these authors\u2014that take on trust a view of the world as\nconforming more or less to the way it appears in ordinary experience.\nIn this usage, the claim that reality is indefinite would not be a\n(mere) opinion, but would be a statement of the truth.)\n\nThe passage now introduces a certain form of speech that is supposed\nto reflect this unopinionated attitude. We are supposed to say\n\u201cabout each single thing that it no more is than is not or both\nis and is not or neither is nor is not\u201d. There are a number of\nintricate questions about the exact relations between the various\nparts of this complicated utterance, and especially about the role and\nsignificance of the \u2018both\u2019 and \u2018neither\u2019\ncomponents. But it is clear that this too is susceptible of being read\nalong the lines of either of the two interpretations introduced above.\nOn the metaphysical interpretation, we are being asked to adopt a form\nof words that reflects the utter indefiniteness of the way things are;\nwe should not say of anything that it is any particular way\nany more than that it is not that way (with \u2018is\u2019\nbeing understood, as commonly in Greek philosophy, as shorthand for\n\u2018is F\u2019, where F stands for any arbitrary\npredicate). On the epistemological interpretation, we are being asked\nto use a manner of speaking that expresses our suspension of judgement\nabout how things are. Sextus Empiricus specifically tells us that\n\u2018no more\u2019 (ou mallon) is a term used by the\nsceptics to express suspension of judgement, and its occurrence in the\nAristocles passage can be taken as an early example of the same type\nof usage.\n\nFinally, in answer to the third question, we are told that the result\nfor those who adopt the unopinionated attitude just recommended is\nfirst aphasia and then ataraxia. Ataraxia,\n\u2018freedom from worry\u2019, is familiar to us from later\nPyrrhonism; this is said by the later Pyrrhonists to be the result of\nthe suspension of judgement that they claimed to be able to induce.\nThe precise sense of aphasia is less clear. Beckwith (2011)\nactually argues that the transmitted text is erroneous, and that we\nshould instead read apatheia, \u201clack of passion\u201d.\nThis is an attractive suggestion; apatheia is indeed a term\nused not infrequently of Pyrrho\u2019s untroubled attitude (see\nsection 5), whereas a reference to aphasia would be\nunparalleled in the other evidence on Pyrrho. However, the proposal is\ninevitably speculative, and aphasia is a term in use in later\nPyrrhonism; it seems worth trying to elucidate it on the assumption\nthat the transmitted text is correct. It might mean\n\u2018non-assertion\u2019, as in Sextus\u2014that is, a refusal to\ncommit oneself to definite alternatives; or it might mean, more\nliterally, \u2018speechlessness\u2019, which could in turn be taken\nto be an initial reaction of stunned silence to the radical position\nwith which one has been presented (an uncomfortable reaction that is\nsubsequently replaced by ataraxia\u2014the passage does say\nthat aphasia comes first and ataraxia comes later).\nBut the decision between these two ways of understanding the term is\nindependent of the broader interpretive issues bearing upon the\npassage as a whole. For some form of \u2018non-assertion\u2019 is\nclearly licensed by either the metaphysical or the epistemological\ninterpretation; and on either interpretation, the view proposed might\nindeed render someone (initially) uncomfortable to the point of\n\u2018speechlessness\u2019. The important point, though, is that\nataraxia is the end result; and this links back to the\nintroductory remark to the effect that the train of thought to be\nsummarized has the effect of making one happy.\n\nWe have, then, two major possibilities. On the one hand, Pyrrho can be\nread as advancing a sweeping metaphysical thesis, that things are in\ntheir real nature indefinite or indeterminate, and encouraging us to\nembrace the consequences of that thesis by refusing to attribute any\ndefinite features to things (at least, as belonging to their real\nnature) and by refusing to accept at face value (again, as revelatory\nof the real nature of things) those myriad aspects of our ordinary\nexperience that represent things as having certain definite features.\nOr, on the other hand, Pyrrho can be read as declaring that the nature\nof things is inaccessible to us, and encouraging us to withdraw our\ntrust (and to speak in such a way as to express our withdrawal of\ntrust) in ordinary experience as a guide to the nature of things. As\nnoted earlier, the second, epistemological interpretation makes\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook a great deal closer to that of the later\nPyrrhonists who took him as an inspiration. But that is not in itself\nany reason for favoring this interpretation over the other,\nmetaphysical one. For on either interpretation Pyrrho is said to\npromise ataraxia, the later Pyrrhonists\u2019 goal, and to\npromise it as a result of a certain kind of withdrawal of\ntrust in the veracity of our everyday impressions of things; the\nconnection between these two points aligns Pyrrho with the later\nPyrrhonists, and sets him apart from every other Greek philosophical\nmovement that preceded later Pyrrhonism. The fact that this later\nsceptical tradition took Pyrrho as an inspiration is therefore readily\nunderstandable whichever of the two interpretations is correct (or\nwhichever they thought was correct). It is also true that, on the\nmetaphysical interpretation of the passage, the grounds on which\nPyrrho advanced his metaphysical thesis of indeterminacy are never\nspecified; this too, like the precise character of the thesis itself,\nmust be a matter for speculative reconstruction. But Aristocles only\npurports to be giving the key points of Timon\u2019s summary; the\nlack of detail, though disappointing, would not be surprising.\n\nSo far we have assumed that the Aristocles passage is supposed to\nrepresent the thought of Pyrrho. But, as noted earlier, some scholars\nhave questioned that assumption (see especially Brunschwig\n(1994), Marchand (2018)). Their reason is that there is only one place\nin the Aristocles passage that reads \u201cTimon says that Pyrrho says\n\u2026\u201d; this is the threefold statement about the nature of things.\nElsewhere Aristocles says \u201cTimon says\u201d, but nowhere else are we\nspecifically told that Timon is conveying the thought of Pyrrho.\nAdmittedly Aristocles introduces Pyrrho as one of those who question\nour ability to know things, but he may have thought that Timon\u2019s own\n(written) ideas are the closest we can get to Pyrrho\u2019s (unwritten)\nideas. Hence it is not obvious that anything beyond the threefold\nstatement about the nature of things should actually be attributed to\nPyrrho himself. Of course, when Aristocles says \u201cTimon says\u201d, he\nmay have meant this as short for \u201cTimon says Pyrrho says\u201d,\nbut he may also have intended to distinguish between the contributions\nof Pyrrho and of Timon.\n\nIf we limit Pyrrho\u2019s contribution in this way, what difference does it\nmake? There is still the question whether the statement about the\nnature of things is about how things are in themselves or about\nour inability to grasp them. But in this case, all the mention of\nsensations and opinions, of their truth or falsehood, and of what we\nshould say belongs to Timon, not to Pyrrho. And this opens the\npossibility that the main philosophical outlook expressed in the\nAristocles passage, whether one reads it metaphysically or\nepistemologically, is Timon\u2019s construction, building on a single idea\nof Pyrrho\u2019s that may have been rather less broad in scope or ambitious\nin character. In particular, as we shall see, much of the other\nevidence on Pyrrho seems to depict him as focused on questions of\nvalue, questioning our characterizations of things as good or bad\nand doubting whether our views on such matters are stable or\nreliable. His statement of the \u201cindifferent\u201d nature of things, as\nreported in the Aristocles passage, may also have been of an\nevaluative kind: things do not really \u2014 or, we cannot tell\nwhether things really \u2014 have the positive or negative evaluative\nqualities we accord them.\n4. Other Reports on Pyrrho\u2019s General Approach\n\nThe other evidence bearing upon Pyrrho\u2019s central philosophical\nattitudes does nothing to settle the dispute between these various\npossible interpretations of the Aristocles passage. A number of texts\nexplicitly or implicitly represent Pyrrho\u2019s outlook as\nessentially identical to the sceptical outlook of the later\nPyrrhonists. However, all of these texts postdate the rise of later\nPyrrhonism itself, and none of them contains anything like the level\nof detail of the Aristocles passage; there is no particular reason to\nsuppose that any of them represents a genuine understanding of Pyrrho\nas distinct from the later Pyrrhonists. There are also a few texts\nthat appear to offer a picture of Pyrrho\u2019s thought that is\ncongenial to the metaphysical interpretation. The most significant of\nthese is a passage from near the beginning of Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nlife of Pyrrho (9.61); Pyrrho, we are told, \u201csaid that nothing\nis either fine or ignoble or just or unjust; and similarly in all\ncases that nothing is the case in reality (m\u00eaden einai\nt\u00eai al\u00eatheiai), but that human beings do everything\nby convention and habit; for each thing is no more this than\nthat\u201d. This looks as if it is attributing to Pyrrho a\nmetaphysical thesis, and a thesis according to which things have no\ndefinite features; it does not seem to be portraying Pyrrho as an\nadvocate of suspension of judgement. However, the passage is\nundoubtedly in some way confused. For immediately beforehand we are\ntold that Pyrrho was the one who initiated the type of philosophy\nconsisting of \u201cinapprehensibility and suspension of\njudgement\u201d, which sounds epistemic; and the previously quoted\npassage is then cited as confirmation of this. In addition, while\n\u201cnothing is the case in reality\u201d and \u201ceach thing is\nno more this than that\u201d sound wholly general, Diogenes\u2019\nexamples are all in the domain of values, which ties in with the\npossibility that Pyrrho\u2019s statement about the nature of things,\nin the Aristocles passage, was only about values and that most of that\npassage represents Timon\u2019s views rather than\nPyrrho\u2019s. This passage of Diogenes, then, cannot be used as\nsupport for any particular understanding of Pyrrho.\n5. Reports on Pyrrho\u2019s Demeanor and Lifestyle\n\nMost of the remaining evidence about Pyrrho has to do with his\npractical attitudes and behavior. There are a number of biographical\nanecdotes, and there are a few fragments of Timon that purport to\ndepict Pyrrho\u2019s state of mind. Some of the biographical\nanecdotes are clearly polemical inventions. For example, Diogenes\n(9.62) reports Antigonus as saying that Pyrrho\u2019s lack of trust\nin his senses led him to ignore precipices, oncoming wagons and\ndangerous dogs, and that his friends had to follow him around to\nprotect him from these various everyday hazards. But he then reports\nthe dissenting verdict of Aenesidemus, according to which Pyrrho was\nperfectly capable of conducting himself in a sensible manner. This\nreflects a longstanding ancient dispute as to whether it is possible\nto live if one radically abandons common-sense attitudes to the world.\nAntigonus has transformed a hostile criticism of Pyrrho\u2014that, if\none really were to adopt the attitudes he recommends, one\nwould be unable consistently to live as a sane human being\n\u2014 into an account of how Pyrrho actually did act; but there is\nno reason to take this seriously as biography. (It does, however,\nraise the question of what it means to mistrust the senses\u2014as\nthe Aristocles passage tells us that either Timon or Pyrrho\ndid\u2014if this is to be consistent with self-preservation in\none\u2019s ordinary behavior; we shall return to this point at the\nend of this section.)\n\nBut there are many other anecdotes, preserved in Diogenes and\nelsewhere, that cannot be dismissed in this fashion. The dominant\nimpression they convey as a group is of an extraordinary impassivity\nor imperturbability; with rare exceptions (which he himself is\nportrayed as regretting), Pyrrho is depicted as maintaining his calm\nand untroubled attitude no matter what happens to him. (The exceptions\nhave led Pyrrho\u2019s outlook to be labeled\n\u201caspirationalism\u201d; see Ribeiro (2022). But while his\nattainment of tranquility was admittedly not perfect, the picture we\nget is of someone who was truly exceptional in this respect.) This\nextends even to extreme physical pain\u2014he is reported not to have\nflinched when subjected to the horrific techniques of ancient\nsurgery\u2014but it also encompasses dangers such as being on a ship\nin a storm. (This is not to say that he did not avoid such troubles if\nhe could, as suggested by the apocryphal stories mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph; it is just to say that he did not lose his\ncomposure in the face of life\u2019s inevitable hardships.) There is\nanother aspect to this untroubled attitude as well. In numerous\nanecdotes Pyrrho is shown as unconcerned with adhering to the normal\nconventions of society; he wanders off for days on end by himself, and\nhe performs tasks that would normally be left to social inferiors,\nsuch as housework and even washing a pig. Here, too, the suggestion is\nthat he does not care about things that ordinary people do care about\n\u2014 in this case, the disapproval of others. (The passage from\nDiogenes quoted in the previous section, according to which Pyrrho\nheld \u201cthat human beings do everything by convention and\nhabit\u201d is not necessarily in conflict with this; by \u2018human\nbeings\u2019 Pyrrho might have meant ordinary human beings,\namong whom he would not have included himself.)\n\nThe fragments of Timon also emphasize Pyrrho\u2019s exceptional\ntranquility, and add a further, more philosophical dimension to it.\nSeveral fragments suggest that this tranquility results from his not\nengaging in theoretical inquiry like other philosophers, and with his\nnot engaging in debate with those philosophers. Other thinkers are\nperturbed by their need to discover how the universe works, and their\nneed to prevail in arguments with their rivals; Pyrrho is unconcerned\nabout any of this.\n\nClearly it would be foolish to accept every detail of this composite\naccount. Timon\u2019s picture is no doubt idealized, and the\nbiographical material surely includes a measure of embellishment.\nCollectively, however, these fragments and anecdotes add up to a\nhighly consistent portrait; it does not seem overconfident to take\nthis at least as reflecting an ideal towards which Pyrrho strived, and\nwhich he achieved to a sufficient degree to have attracted notice.\n\nWhat connections can be drawn between this portrait of Pyrrho\u2019s\ndemeanor and the philosophy expounded in the Aristocles passage? What\nwe have here, plainly, is a fuller specification of the\nataraxia that the Aristocles passage promised as the outcome\nof the process of responding in the recommended way to the three\nquestions. (And it confirms that, even if the process of reaching\nataraxia, as explained in the Aristocles passage, was largely\nTimon\u2019s rather than Pyrrho\u2019s, the ideal of\nataraxia itself was one to which Pyrrho adhered.) But\nwhy should thinking as Pyrrho did, according to that passage,\nyield ataraxia, and why should this outcome take the specific\nform suggested by the material discussed in this section?  Now is a\nconvenient point to address these questions (as we did not do in\ninitially examining the Aristocles passage). We may distinguish the\noverall emotional tranquility depicted in the biographical material\nand the particular tranquility, derived from the avoidance of\ntheoretical inquiry, that is emphasized in the fragments of Timon.\n\nThe most obvious explanation for the overall emotional tranquility\nwould seem to be along the following lines. If one adopts the position\nrecommended in the Aristocles passage, one will not hold any\ndefinite beliefs, about any object or state of affairs, to the effect\nthat the object or state of affairs really is good, or valuable, or\nworth seeking\u2014or, on the other hand, bad or to be avoided. (This\nwill be true on either the metaphysical or the epistemological\ninterpretations of the Aristocles passage, and it will be true of\nPyrrho, given his answer to the first question, even if the rest is\nTimon\u2019s development.) Hence one will attach far less importance to the\nattainment or the avoidance of any particular objects, or the\noccurrence or non-occurrence of any particular state of affairs, than\none would if one thought that these things really did have some kind\nof positive or negative value; nothing will matter to one to anything\nlike the same extent as it matters to most people. If this is on the\nright lines, then Pyrrho\u2019s route to ataraxia closely\nresembles the one described in several places by Sextus Empiricus\n(PH 1.25\u201330, 3.235\u20138, M\n11.110\u201367); the account I have given is in fact modeled after\nSextus\u2019 explanation of how suspension of judgement produces\nataraxia. Indeed, it is difficult to see how else the process\nis to be reconstructed. One difference, however, between the practical\nattitudes of Pyrrho and Sextus is that Sextus attributes an important\nrole to convention in the shaping of one\u2019s behavior; more on\nthis in a moment.\n\nAs for the avoidance of theoretical inquiry and debate, if Pyrrho was\nprimarily a moralist and the Aristocles passage mostly contains\nTimon\u2019s ideas, such inquiry and debate would simply have been\noutside Pyrrho\u2019s sphere of interest. But if the Aristocles\npassage as a whole represents Pyrrho\u2019s own thought, it is fair\nto assume that he will have regarded such inquiry and debate as\ntroublesome because it is necessarily fruitless and interminable. If\nthe real nature of things is indeterminable by us, as the\nepistemological interpretation would have it, then to attempt to\ndetermine the nature of things, and to provide cogent grounds for the\nsuperiority of one\u2019s own theories, is to attempt the impossible;\nsuch matters are simply beyond our grasp. But if, as the metaphysical\ninterpretation would have it, the world is in its real nature\nindefinite, then one is also attempting the impossible, though for a\ndifferent reason; one is attempting to determine a fixed character for\nthings that inherently lack any fixed character. Of course, the thesis\nthat reality is indefinite is itself a definite statement. But it\nfollows from this statement that any attempt to establish fixed and\ndefinite characteristics for specific items in the universe is doomed\nto failure. And it seems to be this kind of theoretical inquiry that\nTimon represents Pyrrho as eschewing; as one fragment puts it\n(addressing Pyrrho), \u201cyou were not concerned to inquire what\nwinds hold sway over Greece, from where everything comes and into what\nit passes\u201d (Diogenes Laertius 9.65). On this reading, then,\nPyrrho\u2019s avoidance of inquiry and debate resembles the disdain\nfor physical speculation that is apparent in some writings of Plato\n(Phaedo for example); physical speculation is fruitless\nbecause the physical world is not susceptible to rational inquiry.\n\nHere another difference may be discerned from the Pyrrhonism of Sextus\nEmpiricus. For although Sextus certainly does not claim to have\ndefinite answers of his own concerning the nature of things, he has no\nqualms about engaging with his opponents in debate, or about pitting\nthem against one another. Indeed, the Pyrrhonism of Sextus depends on\na constant interplay of competing arguments on as many topics as\npossible. One\u2019s suspension of judgement results from one\u2019s\nexperience of the \u2018equal strength\u2019 (isostheneia)\nof the competing considerations on all sides of a given issue; but\nthis requires that one be regularly exposed to such competing\nconsiderations, and the works of Sextus are themselves bountiful\nsources for this. Sextus may agree with Pyrrho that such debates are\ninterminable, but they have an important role in later Pyrrhonist\npractice nonetheless. Pyrrho\u2019s own practice is quite different,\nbecause his ataraxia flows not from an ongoing practice of\nintellectual juggling, but from a conclusion about the nature\nof things, as reported in the Aristocles passage. As we have seen,\nthis conclusion may be interpreted in several different ways, but\nhowever we interpret it, it is a firm view of his.\n\nWe have seen that Pyrrho was unconcerned, or aspired to be\nunconcerned, about things that most of us care about very deeply. But\nhow does one make any decisions at all, if one adopts this kind of\nattitude? Unless we are to believe the stories of Pyrrho as a madman\ndepending on his friends to rescue him from precipices and dogs, we\nare entitled to expect an answer to this question. There is some\nevidence to suggest that the answer proposed\u2014if not by Pyrrho\nhimself, then at least by Timon\u2014was that one relies on the\nappearances. If this is correct, we have another link, at least at a\ngeneral level, with the Pyrrhonism of Sextus, for whom appearances are\nwhat he calls the \u201ccriterion of action\u201d. One difference,\nas mentioned earlier, is that Sextus lists laws and customs as one of\nthe four main varieties of appearances that one may use to guide\none\u2019s behavior; on Sextus\u2019 account, then, certain courses\nof action will appear to one as desirable or undesirable given that\nthey are approved or disapproved of by the prevailing mores. But\nPyrrho seems to have been thoroughly unconventional in some aspects of\nhis behavior. It is impossible to say specifically what kinds of\nphenomena were included for him and Timon under the heading of\n\u2018the appearances\u2019 \u2014 or whether they had anything\nvery precise in mind here. Nevertheless, it looks as if the early or\nproto-Pyrrhonist answer to the question of how one acts and makes\ndecisions is that one does so in light of the way things appear to\none. Depending on how we read the Aristocles passage, this might\namount to \u201cin light of the characteristics that things seem to\nhave (but, for all we know, may not really have)\u201d, or it\nmight amount to \u201cin light of the temporary and contingent\ncharacteristics that things manifest on any given occasion (but that\nare no part of how they really are, since how they really are\nis indefinite)\u201d. In either case, the way in which one mistrusts\nsensations and common-sense opinions, as the Aristocles passage\nrecommends, is not that one pays no attention to them in one\u2019s\neveryday behavior; one mistrusts them simply in that one does not take\nthem as a guide to the underlying nature of things.\n6. \u201cThe Nature of the Divine and the Good\u201d\n\nThere is one further, highly problematic fragment of Timon that seems\nto belong in the area of practical philosophy. This is a set of four\nlines of verse that make reference to \u201cthe nature of the divine\nand the good\u201d. There is no consensus on how to translate these\nlines, and different translations yield very different consequences\nfor interpretation. The first two lines can be rendered either\n\n\n\n(A)\n\u201cFor I will say, as it appears to me to be,\n\nA word of truth, having a correct standard:\u201d \n\nor\n  \n\n(B)\n\u201cFor I will say, as it is plain to me that it is,\n\nA word of truth, having a correct standard:\u201d  \n\n\nThe second two lines can be rendered either\n\n\n\n(C)\n\u201cThat the nature of the divine and the good is eternal,\n\nFrom which a most even-tempered life for a man is derived.\u201d\n\n\nor\n  \n\n(D)\n\u201cThat the nature of the divine and the good is at any time\n\nThat from which life becomes most even-tempered for a man.\u201d\n \n\n\nThere are numerous other disputes over the translation, but these\nalternatives put on display most of the central options for\ninterpretation.\n\nThe lines are quoted by Sextus Empiricus (M 11.20); there is\nno further trace of them in the surviving record. The context in which\nSextus introduces them shows that he is inclined to understand the\nfirst couplet according to reading (A) rather than reading( B); but he\nsuggests that he is not sure about this. The speaker into whose mouth\nTimon put these lines is never identified, but it has generally been\nassumed to be Pyrrho.\n\nIf one understands the second couplet according to reading (C), then\nthe speaker is apparently endorsing a position that attributes\ndefinite natures to things; and this appears flatly inconsistent with\nthe Pyrrho of the Aristocles passage, on any of the readings we\nhave considered. The tension is especially bad if one reads the first\ncouplet according to reading (B), in which case the speaker is\ninsisting that he is in possession of the truth. But even on reading\n(A), where the effect is to weaken the assertion to one about what\nappears to the speaker to be the case, the statement about \u201cthe\nnature of the divine and the good\u201d seems strikingly out of\nkeeping with the rest of what we hear about Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy.\nIt has been suggested that Pyrrho made an exception, in the case of\nthe divine and the good, to his general prohibition on attributing\ndefinite natures to things; but it is hard to see the motivation for\nsuch a move, and this interpretation has not been generally accepted.\nIt is true that Cicero speaks of Pyrrho as holding that virtue is the\nsole good, and that no distinctions of value are to be drawn among\nthings other than virtue and vice. However, as was mentioned earlier,\nCicero always attributes this view to Pyrrho alongside the unorthodox\nStoic Aristo of Chios; he never gives any details about Pyrrho\u2019s\nthinking specifically. We know from other sources that Aristo did hold\nthis position; and, as we have seen, there is good reason to think\nthat Pyrrho did refrain quite generally from attributing positive or\nnegative value to ordinary objects of concern (things other than\nvirtue and vice), which is one part of the position Cicero attributes\nto him and Aristo. So it looks as if Cicero has been misled (probably\nby the sketchiness of the information in his source) into thinking\nthat Pyrrho agreed with Aristo in both parts of his position rather\nthan in just one part. At any rate, Cicero cannot be regarded as\noffering any credible support for an interpretation of Pyrrho that has\nhim believing in a natural good; again, this is just too discordant\nwith the remainder of the evidence.\n\nReading (D) of Timon\u2019s second couplet (which is due, with minor\nmodifications, to Burnyeat (1980)) is intended to eliminate the\ntroublesome reference to an eternal real nature. According to this\ninterpretation, the phrase \u201cthe nature of the divine and the\ngood\u201d refers simply to a characteristic that is attributed to\nPyrrho, and labeled by poetic hyperbole as \u2018divine\u2019, in\nanother fragment of Timon, namely his extraordinary tranquility; the\ncouplet as a whole, then, is saying that tranquility is the source of\nan even-tempered life. And if one combines this with the less dogmatic\nreading (A) of the first couplet, this yields a set of remarks that\nare not obviously in conflict with anything else in the record on\nPyrrho.\n\nThe acceptability of the translation in reading (D) is not beyond\nquestion. There is also some question whether the claim that\ntranquility is the source of an even-tempered life is anything more\nthan vacuous. However, if one assumes that Pyrrho is the speaker of\nthese lines, then this interpretation or something close to it seems\nto be the only way to rescue his thought (as reported by Timon) from\ninconsistency. Another possibility, an interpretatively less\nburdensome one, is to drop the assumption that Pyrrho is the speaker;\nin this case, there is no reason to assume that the thought expressed\nby the lines must be consistent with what we know of Pyrrho\u2019s\nphilosophy. But if one takes this option, one must devise an\nalternative explanation for why Timon would have written these\nlines\u2014including some account of who else the speaker might be.\nThis challenge has recently been taken up in Clayman (2009), chapter\n2. Clayman argues that the speaker is Timon himself, and that the\nlines serve a programmatic function at the opening of the poem; in\nlight of parallel passages in other early Hellenistic poetry, the\nreference to truth is understood as an allusion to poetic\nverisimilitude rather than to anything philosophically problematic.\nFinally, it has been suggested (in Svavarsson 2002) that\nmuthon, rendered in both readings (A) and (B) by\n\u201cword\u201d, should rather be understood as \u201cmyth\u201d\nin the sense of \u201cfiction\u201d (and \u201cof truth\u201d\nlinked instead, as is linguistically quite possible, with\n\u201cstandard\u201d). In this case, again, there is no difficulty\nin understanding the second couplet as expressing a dogmatic position;\nindeed, such a reading is only to be expected, since the position is\nbeing debunked, not advocated. Green (2017) has extended\nSvavarsson\u2019s suggestion by proposing that \u201cword of\ntruth\u201d and \u201ccorrect standard\u201d are to be understood\nsarcastically rather than at face value, making fun of other\nthinkers\u2019 belief in these things (which would also render the\nthought less dogmatic; it would not simply be a declaration of\nfalsehood). But whether the word muthos, all by itself, can\ncarry this weight of significance\u2014or whether, if that is what\nTimon had intended, he would not have chosen some less ambiguous means\nof expressing it\u2014is open to question. It is fair to say that no\nresolution of these matters is in sight.\n7. Influences on Pyrrho\n\nMany different philosophical antecedents have been claimed for Pyrrho.\nSince we know very little about which philosophical currents Pyrrho\nmay have been acquainted with, such claims are bound to be in large\nmeasure speculative. There are, however, a couple of exceptions to\nthis; as noted at the outset, Pyrrho was associated with Anaxarchus\nand was reported to have encountered some unnamed Indian thinkers. The\nlittle that we know of Anaxarchus seems to suggest that his philosophy\nhad a good deal in common with Pyrrho\u2019s. Diogenes Laertius\n(9.60) ascribes to him an attitude of apatheia and\neukolia, \u2018freedom from emotion\u2019 and\n\u2018contentedness\u2019; as noted earlier, apatheia is\nused in some sources to describe Pyrrho\u2019s attitude as well, and\nthe combination of the two terms seems to describe something close to\nthe state cultivated by Pyrrho. We also hear from Sextus Empiricus\nthat Anaxarchus \u201clikened existing things to stage-painting and\ntook them to be similar to the things which strike us while asleep or\ninsane\u201d (M 7.88). This has often been taken as an early\nexpression of a form of epistemological scepticism. But it may also be\ntaken as an ontological comment on the insubstantiality of the world\naround us; it is things (as opposed to our impressions of\nthings) that are assimilated to stage-sets and the contents of dreams\nand fantasies. Either way, the remark looks like an anticipation of\nthe position expounded in the Aristocles passage; the first\nreading conforms to the epistemological interpretation of that\npassage, and the second to the metaphysical interpretation. It\nappears, then, that Pyrrho may have borrowed to a considerable extent\nfrom Anaxarchus, especially if the Aristocles passage as a whole\nrepresents Pyrrho\u2019s thought.\n\nWe do not know the identity of the \u201cnaked wise men\u201d whom\nPyrrho met in India, or what they thought. There are reports of other\nmeetings between Indian and Greek thinkers during Alexander\u2019s\nexpedition, and these tend to emphasize the Indians\u2019\nextraordinary impassivity and insensitivity to pain and hardship. It\nis not unlikely that Pyrrho, too, was impressed by traits of this\nkind. Though precedents for his ideal of ataraxia exist in\nearlier Greek philosophy as well, his reported ability to withstand\nsurgery without flinching is exceptional in the Greek context (and\nquite distinct from anything in later Pyrrhonism); if we believe this\nstory, it is tempting to explain it by way of some form of training\nfrom the Indians. Some scholars have sought to establish more detailed\nlinks between the thought of the Aristocles passage and various\ncurrents in ancient Indian philosophy; and Beckwith (2015) finds in\nPyrrho an authentic representative of early Buddhism. But there is at\nleast room for debate about how far these similarities really go. From\nan opposing perspective, some have suggested that the linguistic\nbarriers would have ruled out an interchange of any great\nphilosophical subtlety between the Indians and Pyrrho. But this may be\noverly pessimistic; the expedition lasted a number of years, and some\npeople manage to learn new languages remarkably quickly.\n\nBeyond these figures with attested connections to Pyrrho, it is\nplausible to suppose a certain influence on Pyrrho from Democritus.\nPyrrho is reported to have had a special admiration for Democritus\n(Diogenes Laertius 9.67, citing Pyrrho\u2019s associate Philo);\nDemocritus is one of the few philosophers besides Pyrrho himself who\nseems to escape serious criticism in Timon\u2019s Lampoons;\nand Anaxarchus belonged in the tradition of thinkers stemming from\nDemocritus. The influence may have been mainly in the ethical area;\nDemocritus, too, had an ethical ideal that is recognizably a\nforerunner to Pyrrho\u2019s ataraxia. If one adopts the\nepistemological interpretation of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy, one may\nsee an additional area of influence in Democritus\u2019 sceptical\npronouncements about the prospects for knowledge of the world around\nus.\n\nAlternatively, if one interprets Pyrrho along metaphysical lines, one\nmay be inclined to look to Plato and the Eleatics as possible\ninfluences. Timon\u2019s verdicts on these figures in the\nLampoons are at least partially favorable; and, as was hinted\nat earlier on, the dim view of sensibles that is suggested by a number\nof Plato\u2019s dialogues\u2014but also anticipated by the\nEleatics\u2014seems to have something in common with Pyrrho\u2019s\nview of reality (on the metaphysical interpretation) as indeterminate.\nThe difference, of course, is that Pyrrho does not suggest any higher\nlevel of reality such as Plato\u2019s Forms or the Eleatic Being.\n8. Pyrrho\u2019s Influence\n\nPyrrho\u2019s relation to the later Pyrrhonists has already been\ndiscussed. Given the importance of Pyrrhonism in earlier modern\nphilosophy, Pyrrho\u2019s indirect influence may be thought of as\nvery considerable. But beyond his being adopted as a figurehead in\nlater Pyrrhonism\u2014itself never a widespread philosophical\nmovement \u2014 Pyrrho seems to have had very little impact in the\nancient world after his own lifetime. Both Cicero and Seneca refer to\nPyrrho as a neglected figure without a following, and the surviving\ntestimonia do not contradict this impression. It is possible that he\nhad some influence on the form of scepticism adopted by Arcesilaus and\nother members of the Academy; the extent to which this is so is\ndisputed and difficult to assess. It is also possible that the\nEpicureans, whose aim was also ataraxia, learned something\nfrom Pyrrho; there are indications of an association between Pyrrho\nand Nausiphanes, the teacher of Epicurus. But if so, the extent of the\nEpicureans\u2019 borrowing was strictly limited. For them,\nataraxia is to be attained by coming to understand that the\nuniverse consists of atoms and void; and the Epicureans\u2019\nattitude towards the senses was anything but one of mistrust.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"AncTex\">Ancient Texts</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"AncTex\">Ancient Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Decleva Caizzi, F., 1981, <em>Pirrone: Testimonianze</em>, Naples:\nBibliopolis.
