Pragmatic\nprocessing, however, is not necessarily fulfilled by conscious\ninference: processes that enrich the output of syntax are\nsub-doxastic, direct, and automatic. The resulting representation of\nutterance meaning is the only representation that has cognitive\nreality and it is subject to truth-conditional analysis. On this\naccount, the content of an utterance is arrived at directly, similar\nto the act of perception of an object. Recanati calls this view\nanti-inferentialist in that \u201ccommunication is as direct as\nperception\u201d (Recanati 2002: 109): the processing of the\nspeaker\u2019s intentions is (at least normally) direct, automatic,\nand unreflective. Such processes enriching the actually uttered\ncontent are called primary pragmatic processes. Some of them make use\nof contextual information, others are context-independent. So, they\ninclude some cases of Grice\u2019s GCIs as well as some\nparticularised implicatures (PCIs; on implied content see also\nTonhauser et al. 2013) \u2013 but only the ones which\nfurther develop the logical form of the uttered sentence. When the\npragmatic addition constitutes a separate thought, it is, on this\naccount, an implicature proper, arrived at through a secondary,\nconscious, and reflective pragmatic process.\n\nThere are two kinds of enrichment of the content obtained through the\nsyntactic processing: (i) completing of a semantically incomplete\nproposition as in (10b), called saturation, and (ii) further\nelaboration of the meaning of the sentence that is not guided by any\nsyntactic or conceptual gaps but instead is merely triggered by the\nhearer\u2019s opinion that something other than the bare meaning of\nthe sentence was intended, as in (11b). The latter process is called\nfree enrichment.\n\n(10a)The fence isn\u2019t strong enough.\n(10b)The fence isn\u2019t strong enough to withstand the gales.\n(11a)John hasn\u2019t eaten.\n(11b)John hasn\u2019t eaten dinner yet.\n\nDefault interpretations are here defaults for processing of an\nutterance in a particular context. Automatic and unconscious\nenrichment produces a default interpretation of the utterance and\n\u201c[o]nly when there is something wrong does the hearer suspend or\ninhibit the automatic transition which characterizes the normal cases\nof linguistic communication\u201d. (Recanati 2002: 109). To sum up,\nsuch defaults ensue automatically, directly, without the effort of\ninference. They are cancellable, they can make use of contextual\nclues, but they are not \u2018processes\u2019 in any cognitively\ninteresting sense of the term: they don\u2019t involve conscious\ninference, albeit, in Recanati\u2019s terminology, they involve\ninference in the broad sense: the agent is not aware of performing an\ninference but is aware of the consequences of this pragmatic\nenrichment of the interpreted sentence.\n",
