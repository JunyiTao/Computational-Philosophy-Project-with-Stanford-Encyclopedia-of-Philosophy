Correctness and Etymological Meaning (390e\u2013394e)\n\nWhen Socrates infers from the argument of the tool analogy \u201cthat\nnames belong to the objects by nature\u201d (390d/e), Hermogenes is\nnot fully convinced and demands to know what \u201cthe natural\ncorrectness of a name consists in\u201d (390e). As has become evident\nby now, this is a good question\u2014it is in fact not clear what\nHermogenes would commit himself to if he accepted\n (NAT).\n Socrates attempts to answer Hermogenes\u2019 question at\n390e\u2013394e by discussing the name \u201cAstyanax\u201d.\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d is actually a proper name of a victim of the\nTrojan war (Hector\u2019s son, who would have become king of Troy had\nthe city not been destroyed). However, Socrates does not treat it as a\nproper name, but as a general term that refers to the kind\n(genos) of kings. He gives the following account of its\ncorrectness:\n\n\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d is a correct name for the kind (genos)\nof kings because its etymological meaning (\u201ctownlord\u201d)\nensures that it indicates (d\u00ealoun) the way of being\n(ousia) that the members of this kind share.\n\n\nWhat does this account entail? What, in particular, does it mean to\nsay that \u201cAstyanax\u201d indicates the way of being\nthat is shared by all kings? It has been claimed that indicating a way\nof being is tantamount to disclosing its definition (see, e.g., Barney\n2001: 103). But Socrates\u2019 examples, and his later use of the\nterm d\u00ealoun (see\n section 8.2),\n suggest that this is an overinterpretation (Ademollo 2011: 165f.).\nApparently, a way of being is indicated if and only if it is\ndistinguished from other ways of being\u2014if it is picked out, as\nit were.\n\nHow, then, does the etymological meaning of the name\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d ensure that it picks out the way of being that\nis characteristic of kings? Socrates\u2019 idea seems to be that the\netymological meaning of the name ensures that it functions as a\ndescription of what it means to be a king. It is important to\nnote, however, that indicating something does not necessarily entail\ndescribing it; as Socrates will explain at 421c\u2013427e, names that\nare not composed of other names indicate a way of being in virtue of\nimitating it. But in the passage at hand, he ignores this possibility\nand focuses on names that are composed of other\nnames\u2014etymologically complex names, as one might\nsay.\n\nSocrates does not stop to distill a general account of the correctness\nof etymologically complex names from his reflections on the name\n\u201cAstyanax\u201d. But he clearly has the following account in\nmind:\n\n(NAT*)\nIf an etymologically complex name is a correct name for a given\nkind, this is because its etymological meaning ensures that it\ndescribes and thus indicates the way of being (ousia) that\nthe members of the kind share.\n\n\nAt first blush,\n (NAT*)\n seems to be a far cry from\n (NAT),\n the central claim of the tool analogy. But this impression might be\nmisleading. According to (NAT), a correct name for a given kind is a\nlinguistic device that has been created in a way that makes it fit for\npicking out the way of being that the members of this kind share. As\nhas just been indicated, picking out a way of being and indicating a\nway of being are the same act. Hence, (NAT) would appear to be\nequivalent to the claim that a correct name for a given kind must be\nsuited for indicating the way of being that the members of this kind\nshare. And clearly, (NAT*) does provide an explanation of how a name\ncan be suited for this act.\n\nThere is one more thing to note before we move on: As virtually all\ncommentators who take a closer look at 390e\u2013394e agree,\nSocrates\u2019 discussion of the name \u201cAstyanax\u201d is\npeppered with blatant mistakes. Proponents of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C\n see this as Plato\u2019s way of discrediting\n (NAT*)\n (Heitsch 1984: 53\u201357; Eckl 2003: 135\u2013155; Ademollo 2011:\n146\u2013180); proponents of Reading B, on the other\nhand, need to bite the bullet and argue that Plato is simply not aware\nof Socrates\u2019 blunders (Sedley 2003: 75\u201386).\n",
