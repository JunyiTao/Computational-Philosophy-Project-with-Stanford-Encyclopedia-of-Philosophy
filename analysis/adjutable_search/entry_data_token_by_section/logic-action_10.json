    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Artificial Intelligence || Representing and reasoning about actions\n4.1 Representing and reasoning about actions\n\nAs said above, the representation of actions and formalisms/logics to reason with them are very central to AI and particularly the field of KR. One of the main problems that one encounters in the literature on reasoning about actions in AI, and much more so than in mainstream computer science, is the discovery of the so-called frame problem (McCarthy and Hayes 1969). Although this problem has been generalized by philosophers such as Dennett (1984) to a general problem of relevance and salience of properties pertaining to action, the heart of the problem is that in a \u2018common-sense\u2019 setting as one encounters in AI, it is virtually impossible to specify all the effects by the actions of concern, as well as, notably, all non-effects. For instance, given an action, think about what changes if the action is performed and what does not\u2014generally the latter is much more difficult to produce than the former, leading to large, complex attempts to specify the non-effects. But there is of course also the problem of relevance: what aspects are relevant for the problem at hand; which properties do we need to take into consideration? In particular, this also pertains to the preconditions of an action that would guarantee the successful performance/execution of an action. Again, in a common-sense environment, these are formidable, and one can always think of another (pre)condition that should be incorporated. For instance, for successfully starting the motor of a car, there should be a charged battery, sufficient fuel, \u2026, but also not too cold weather, or even sufficient power in your fingers to be able to turn the starting key, the presence of a motor in the car, \u2026 etc. etc. In AI one tries to find a solution for the frame problem, having to do with the smallest possible specification. Although this problem gave rise to so-called defeasible or non-monotonic solutions such as defaults (\u2018normally a car has a motor\u2019), which in itself gave rise to a whole new a realm within AI called nonmonotonic or commonsense reasoning, this is beyond the scope of this entry (we refer the interested reader to the article by Thomason (2003) in this encyclopedia). We focus here on a solution that does not appeal to nonmonotonicity (directly).\n\nReiter (2001) has proposed a (partial) solution within a framework, called the situation calculus, that has been very popular in KR especially in North America since it was proposed by John McCarthy, one of the founding fathers of AI (McCarthy 1963b, McCarthy 1986). The situation calculus is a dialect of first-order logic with some mild second-order features, especially designed to reason about actions. (One of its distinctive features is that of the so-called reification of semantic notions such as states or possible worlds (as well as truth predicates) into syntactic entities (\u2018situations\u2019) in the object language.) For the sake of conformity in this entry and reasons of space, we will try rendering Reiter\u2019s idea within (first-order) dynamic logic, or rather, a slight extension of it. (We need action variables to denote action expressions and equalities between action variables and actions (or rather action expressions) as well as (universal) quantification over action variables).\n\nWhat is known as Reiter\u2019s solution to the frame problem assumes a so-called closed system, that is to say, a system in which all (relevant) actions and changeable properties (in this setting often called \u2018fluents\u2019 to emphasize their changeability over time) are known. By this assumption it is possible to express the (non)change as a consequence of performing actions as well as the issue of the check for the preconditions to ensure successful performance in a very succinct and elegant manner, and coin it in a so-called successor state axiom of the form\n\n\\[\n(\\forall A)[\\Poss(A) \\rightarrow(([A]f(\\boldsymbol{x})) \\leftrightarrow (\\gamma_{f}^+ (\\boldsymbol{x}, A) \\vee(f(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\wedge \\neg \\gamma_{f}^- (\\boldsymbol{x}, A))))]\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is an action variable, and \\(\\gamma_{f}^+ (\\boldsymbol{x}, A)\\) and \\(\\gamma_{f}^- (\\boldsymbol{x}, A)\\) are \u2018simple\u2019 expressions without action modalities expressing the conditions for \\(\\phi\\) becoming true and false, respectively. So the formula is read informally as, under certain preconditions pertaining to the action \\(A\\) at hand, the fluent (predicate) \\(f\\) becomes true of arguments \\(\\boldsymbol{x}\\), if and only if either the condition \\(\\gamma_{f}^+ (\\boldsymbol{x}, A)\\) holds or \\(f(\\boldsymbol{x})\\) holds (before the execution of \\(A)\\) and the condition \\(\\gamma_{f}^- (\\boldsymbol{x}, A)\\) (that would cause it to become false) does not hold. Furthermore, the expression \\(\\Poss(A)\\) is used schematically in such axioms, where the whole action theory should be complemented with so-called precondition axioms of the form \\(\\phi_A \\rightarrow \\Poss(A)\\) for concrete expressions \\(\\phi_A\\) stating the actual preconditions needed for a successful execution of \\(A\\).\n\nTo see how this works out in practice we consider a little example in a domain where we have a vase \\(v\\) which may be broken or not (so we have \u201cbroken\u201d as a fluent), and actions drop and repair. We also assume the (non-changeable) predicates fragile and held-in-hand of an object. Now the successor state axiom becomes \n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n(\\forall A)[&\\Poss(A) \\rightarrow \\\\\n&([A]\\mathop{\\mathrm{broken}}(v) \\leftrightarrow \\\\\n&\\ ((A = \\mathop{\\mathrm{drop}}(v) \\wedge \\mathop{\\mathrm{fragile}}(v)) \\vee (\\mathop{\\mathrm{broken}}(v) \\wedge A \\ne \\mathop{\\mathrm{repair}}(v))))]\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nand as precondition axioms we have \\(\\textrm{held-in-hand}(x) \\rightarrow \\Poss(\\mathop{\\mathrm{drop}}(x))\\) and \\(\\mathop{\\mathrm{broken}}(x) \\rightarrow \\Poss(\\mathop{\\mathrm{repair}}(x))\\). This action theory is very succinct: one needs only one successor state axiom per fluent and one precondition axiom per action.\n\nFinally in this subsection we must mention some other well-known approaches to reasoning about action and change. The event calculus (Kowalski and Sergot 1986, Shanahan 1990, Shanahan 1995) and fluent calculus (Thielscher 2005) are alternatives to the situation-based representation of actions in the situation calculus. The reader is also referred to Sandewall and Shoham 1994 for historical and methodological issues as well as the relation with non-monotonic reasoning. These ideas have led to very efficient planning systems (e.g., TALplanner, Kvarnstr\u00f6m and Doherty 2000) and practical ways to program robotic agents (e.g., the GOLOG family (Reiter 2001) of languages based on the situation calculus, and FLUX (Thielscher 2005) based on the fluent calculus).\n",
