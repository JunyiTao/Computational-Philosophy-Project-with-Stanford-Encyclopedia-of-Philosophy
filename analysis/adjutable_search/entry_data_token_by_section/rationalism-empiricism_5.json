    "main_text": "The Innate Knowledge Thesis\n4. The Innate Concept Thesis\n\nAccording to the Innate Concept thesis, some of our concepts have not\nbeen gained from experience. They are instead part of our rational\nmake-up, and experience simply triggers a process by which we\nconsciously grasp them. The main concern motivating the rationalist\nshould be familiar by now: the content of some concepts seems to\noutstrip anything we could have gained from experience. An example of\nthis reasoning is presented by Descartes in the Meditations.\nAlthough he sometimes seems committed to the view that all our ideas\nare innate (Adams 1975 and Gotham 2002), he there classifies our ideas\nas adventitious, invented by us, and innate. Adventitious ideas, such\nas a sensation of heat, are gained directly through sense experience.\nIdeas invented by us, such as our idea of a hippogriff, are created by\nus from other ideas we possess. Innate ideas, such as our ideas of\nGod, of extended matter, of substance, and of a perfect triangle, are\nplaced in our minds by God at creation. Consider Descartes\u2019s\nargument that our concept of God, as an infinitely perfect being, is\ninnate. Our concept of God is not directly gained in experience, as\nparticular tastes, sensations, and mental images might be. Its content\nis beyond what we could ever construct by applying available mental\noperations to what experience directly provides. From experience, we\ncan gain the concept of a being with finite amounts of various\nperfections, one, for example, that is finitely knowledgeable,\npowerful and good. We cannot however move from these empirical\nconcepts to the concept of a being of infinite perfection. (\u201cI\nmust not think that, just as my conceptions of rest and darkness are\narrived at by negating movement and light, so my perception of the\ninfinite is arrived at not by means of a true idea but by merely\nnegating the finite,\u201d Third Meditation, p. 94.) Descartes\nsupplements this argument by another. Not only is the content of our\nconcept of God beyond what experience can provide, the concept is a\nprerequisite for our employment of the concept of finite perfection\ngained from experience. (\u201cMy perception of the infinite, that is\nGod, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is\nmyself. For how could I understand that I doubted or\ndesired\u2014that is lacked something\u2014and that I was not wholly\nperfect, unless there were in me some idea of a more perfect being\nwhich enabled me to recognize my own defects by comparison,\u201d\nThird Meditation, p. 94).\n\nAn empiricist response to this general line of argument is given by\nLocke (Essay, 1.4.1\u201325). First, there is the problem of\nexplaining what it is for someone to have an innate concept. If having\nan innate concept entails consciously entertaining it at present or in\nthe past, then Descartes\u2019s position is open to obvious\ncounterexamples. Young children and people from other cultures do not\nconsciously entertain the concept of God and have not done so. Second,\nthere is the objection that we have no need to appeal to innate\nconcepts in the first place. Contrary to Descartes\u2019s argument,\nwe can explain how experience provides all our ideas, including those\nthe rationalists take to be innate, and with just the content that the\nrationalists attribute to them.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s New Essays offers a rationalist reply to the\nfirst concern. Where Locke puts forth the image of the mind as a blank\nslate on which experience writes, Leibniz offers us the image of a\nblock of marble, the veins of which determine what sculpted figures it\nwill accept (New Essays, Preface, p. 153). Leibniz\u2019s\nmetaphor contains an insight that Locke misses. The mind plays a role\nin determining the nature of its contents. This point does not,\nhowever, require the adoption of the Innate Concept thesis. Locke\nmight still point out that we are not required to have the concepts\nthemselves and the ability to use them, innately. In contemporary\nterms, what we are required to have is the right hardware that allows\nfor the optimal running of the actual software. For Locke, there are\nno constrains here; for Leibniz, only a particular type of software\nis, indeed, able to be supported by the extant hardware. Put\ndifferently, the hardware itself determines what software can be\noptimally run, for a Leibnizian.\n\nRationalists have responded to the second part of the empiricist\nattack on the Innate Concept thesis\u2014the empiricists\u2019 claim\nthat the thesis is without basis, as all our ideas can be explained as\nderived from experience\u2014by focusing on difficulties in the\nempiricists\u2019 attempts to give such an explanation. The\ndifficulties are illustrated by Locke\u2019s account. According to\nLocke, experience consists in external sensation and inner reflection.\nAll our ideas are either simple or complex, with the former being\nreceived by us passively in sensation or reflection and the latter\nbeing built by the mind from simple materials through various mental\noperations. Right at the start, the account of how simple ideas are\ngained is open to an obvious counterexample acknowledged, but then set\naside, by Hume in presenting his own empiricist theory. Consider the\nmental image of a particular shade of blue. If Locke is right, the\nidea is a simple one and should be passively received by the mind\nthrough experience. Hume points out otherwise:\n\nSuppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years\nand to have become perfectly acquainted with colors of all kinds,\nexcept one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has\nbeen his fortune to meet with; let all the different shades of that\ncolor, except that single one, be placed before him, descending\ngradually from the deepest to the lightest, it is plain that he will\nperceive a blank where that shade is wanting and will be sensible that\nthere is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous\ncolors than in any other. Now I ask whether it be possible for him,\nfrom his own imagination, to supply this deficiency and raise up to\nhimself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been\nconveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are but few will be of\nthe opinion that he can\u2026 (Enquiry, 2, pp. 15\u201316)\n\n\nEven when it comes to such simple ideas as the image of a particular\nshade of blue, the mind seems to be more than a blank slate on which\nexperience writes. The main question is whether the veins in\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphor should count as part of the knowledge or just\nas part of our biological mental architecture: all the knowledge we\ncan ever acquire is constrained by the type of beings we are. This does\nnot require our positing that concepts be part of the inner workings,\nat the beginning of our lives.\n\nOn the other hand, consider, too, our concept of a particular color,\nsay red. Critics of Locke\u2019s account have pointed out the\nweaknesses in his explanation of how we gain such a concept by the\nmental operation of abstraction on individual cases. For one thing, it\nmakes the incorrect assumption that various instances of a particular\nconcept share a common feature. Carruthers puts the objection as\nfollows:\n\nIn fact problems arise for empiricists even in connection with the\nvery simplest concepts, such as those of colour. For it is false that\nall instances of a given colour share some common feature. In which\ncase we cannot acquire the concept of that colour by abstracting the\ncommon feature of our experience. Thus consider the concept\nred. Do all shades of red have something in common? If so,\nwhat? It is surely false that individual shades of red consist, as it\nwere, of two distinguishable elements a general redness together with\na particular shade. Rather, redness consists in a continuous\nrange of shades, each of which is only just distinguishable\nfrom its neighbors. Acquiring the concept red is a matter of\nlearning the extent of the range. (1992, p. 59)\n\n\nFor another thing, Locke\u2019s account of concept acquisition from\nparticular experiences seems circular: \u201cFor noticing or\nattending to a common feature of various things presupposes that you\nalready possess the concept of the feature in question.\u201d\n(Carruthers 1992, p. 55)\n\nConsider in this regard Locke\u2019s account of how we gain our\nconcept of causation.\n\nIn the notice that our senses take of the constant vicissitude of\nthings, we cannot but observe, that several particulars, both\nqualities and substances; begin to exist; and that they receive this\ntheir existence from the due application and operation of some other\nbeing. From this observation, we get our ideas of cause and effect.\n(Essay, 2.26.1)\n\n\nWe get our concept of causation from our observation that some things\nreceive their existence from the application and operation of some\nother things. Yet, to be able to make this observation, we must have\nour minds primed to do so. Rationalists argue that we cannot make this\nobservation unless we already have the concept of causation.\nEmpiricists, on the other hand, argue that our minds are constituted\nin a certain way, so that we can gain our ideas of causation and of\npower in a non-circular manner.\n\nRationalists would argue that Locke\u2019s account of how we gain our\nidea of power displays a similar circularity.\n\nThe mind being every day informed, by the senses, of the alteration of\nthose simple ideas, it observes in things without; and taking notice\nhow one comes to an end, and ceases to be, and another begins to exist\nwhich was not before; reflecting also on what passes within itself,\nand observing a constant change of its ideas, sometimes by the\nimpression of outward objects on the senses, and sometimes by the\ndetermination of its own choice; and concluding from what it has so\nconstantly observed to have been, that the like changes will for the\nfuture be made in the same things, by like agents, and by the like\nways, considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its\nsimple ideas changed, and in another the possibility of making that\nchange; and so comes by that idea which we call power.\n(Essay, 2.21.1)\n\n\nWe come by the idea of power though considering the possibility of\nchanges in our ideas made by experiences and our own choices. Yet, to\nconsider this possibility\u2014of some things making a\nchange in others\u2014we must already have a concept of power,\nrationalists would say. Empiricists, on the other hand, would point\nout, again, that what we actually need is for our minds to be able to\nrecognize this, by having the correct abilities and faculties. Just as\nwe don\u2019t need to have a concept telling us how it is that we\nhave binocular vision, being able to recognize change would be cashed\nout by us having the requisite faculty enabling us to do so.\n\nAnother way to meet at least some of these challenges to an empiricist\naccount of the origin of our concepts is to revise our understanding\nof the content of our concepts so as to bring them more in line with\nwhat experience will clearly provide. Hume famously takes this\napproach. Beginning in a way reminiscent of Locke, he distinguishes\nbetween two forms of mental contents or \u201cperceptions,\u201d as\nhe calls them: impressions and ideas. Impressions are the contents of\nour current experiences: our sensations, feelings, emotions, desires,\nand so on. Ideas are mental contents derived from impressions. Simple\nideas are copies of impressions; complex ideas are derived from\nimpressions by \u201ccompounding, transposing, augmenting or\ndiminishing\u201d them. Given that all our ideas are thus gained from\nexperience, Hume offers us the following method for determining the\ncontent of any idea and thereby the meaning of any term taken to\nexpress it.\n\nWhen we entertain, therefore, any suspicion that a philosophical term\nis employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we\nneed but inquire from what impression is that supposed idea\nderived? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will confirm\nour suspicion. (Enquiry, 2, p. 16)\n\n\nUsing this test, Hume draws out one of the most important implications\nof the empiricists\u2019 denial of the Innate Concept thesis. If\nexperience is indeed the source of all ideas, then our experiences\nalso determine the content of our ideas. Our ideas of causation, of\nsubstance, of right and wrong have their content determined by the\nexperiences that provide them. Those experiences, Hume argues, are\nunable to support the content that many rationalists and some\nempiricists, such as Locke, attribute to the corresponding ideas. Our\ninability to explain how some concepts, with the contents the\nrationalists attribute to them, are gained from experience should not\nlead us to adopt the Innate Concept thesis. It should lead us to\naccept a more limited view of the contents for those concepts, and\nthereby a more limited view of our ability to describe and understand\nthe world.\n\nConsider, for example, our idea of causation. Descartes takes it to be\ninnate. Hume\u2019s empiricist account severely limits its content.\nOur idea of causation is derived from a feeling of expectation rooted\nin our experiences of the constant conjunction of similar causes and\neffects.\n\nIt appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connection among\nevents arises from a number of similar instances which occur, of the\nconstant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be\nsuggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible\nlights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances,\ndifferent from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly\nsimilar, except only that after a repetition of similar instances the\nmind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect\nits usual attendant and to believe that it will exist. This\nconnection, therefore, which we feel in the mind, this\ncustomary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual\nattendant, is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea\nof power or necessary connection. (Enquiry, 7.2, p. 59)\n\n\nThe source of our idea in experience determines its content.\n\nSuitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an\nobject followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the\nfirst are followed by objects similar to the second\u2026 We may,\ntherefore, suitably to this experience, form another definition of\ncause and call it an object followed by another, and whose\nappearance always conveys the thought of the other.\n(Enquiry, 7.2, p. 60)\n\n\nOur claims, and any knowledge we may have, about causal connections in\nthe world turn out, given the limited content of our empirically based\nconcept of causation, to be claims and knowledge about the constant\nconjunction of events and our own feelings of expectation. Thus, the\ninitial disagreement between rationalists and empiricists about the\nsource of our ideas leads to one about their content and thereby the\ncontent of our descriptions and knowledge of the world.\n\nLike philosophical debates generally, the rationalist/empiricist\ndebate ultimately concerns our position in the world, in this case our\nposition as rational inquirers. To what extent do our faculties of\nreason and experience support our attempts to know and understand our\nsituation?\n",
