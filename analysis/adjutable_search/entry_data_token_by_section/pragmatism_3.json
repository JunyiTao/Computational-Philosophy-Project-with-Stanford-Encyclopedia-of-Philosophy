    "main_text": "Pragmatist Theories of Truth || Peirce on Truth and Reality\n3.1 Peirce on Truth and Reality\n\nThe final section of \u2018How to Make our Ideas Clear\u2019\npromises to consider a fundamental logical conception,\nreality. This concept seems clear: \u2018every child\nuses it with perfect confidence, never dreaming that he does not\nunderstand it.\u2019 Thus it reaches Peirce\u2019s first level of\nmeaning-clarity. A (second-level) verbal definition of the concept is\nalso readily forthcoming: \u2018we may define the real as that whose\ncharacters are independent of what anybody may think them to\nbe.\u2019 But, Peirce announces, we shall need to apply the Pragmatic\nMaxim if our idea of reality is to be \u2018perfectly clear\u2019.\nAt this stage the concept of truth enters the discussion:\nPeirce claims that the object represented in a true proposition is our\nbest understanding of the real. So we have to turn to his remarks\nabout truth to see how the mind-independence alleged in the abstract\ndefinition of reality is to be operationalized and thus properly\nunderstood from a pragmatist perspective.\n\nHis pragmatic clarification of truth is expressed as follows:\n\nThe opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented\nin this opinion is the real. That is the way I would explain reality.\n(EP1: 139)\n\n\nSeven years earlier, in a review of a new edition of the writings of\nBerkeley, Peirce had described this way of thinking as the\n\u2018realist conception of reality\u2019 (EP1:88\u20139), in\ncontrast with a \u2018nominalist conception of reality\u2019 which\nmany early modern philosophers took for granted. Nominalists assume\nthat the real can only be the antecedent cause of singular sensations\nwhich provide our evidence for beliefs about the external world. This\nnaturally leads to a certain (age-old) solipsistic skepticism\nconcerning whether a person can gain knowledge that transcends their\nown perceptions and epistemic perspective. Peirce\u2019s pragmatist\nclarification of truth offers an alternative conceptualization of\n\u2018being constrained by reality\u2019, in terms of\nconsequent convergence of opinion, through the process of\ninquiry, rather than as an antecedent cause of sensations.\n\nAll this has led Peirce\u2019s account of truth to be expressed in\nthe slogan: truth is the end of inquiry, where\n\u2018end\u2019 is to be understood not as a \u2018finish\u2019\n(some point in time when all human questions will be settled) but as a\ngoal, telos or final cause. This original understanding of truth has\nfaced challenges that it is \u2018too realist\u2019 insofar as it\ntakes for granted that inquiry will converge on just one answer to any\ngiven question. Here Bertrand Russell asked, \u2018Is this an\nempirical generalization from the history of research? Or is it an\noptimistic belief in the perfectibility of man?\u2019, concluding,\n\u2018Whatever interpretation we adopt, we seem committed to some\nvery rash assertion.\u2019 (1939: 146). Similarly, Quine wrote,\n\u2018\u2026we have no reason to suppose that man\u2019s surface\nirritations even unto eternity admit of any one systematization that\nis scientifically better or simpler than all possible others\u2019\n(1960: 23). However, later in life Peirce urged that the hypothesis of\nmonistic convergence is best viewed as a regulative hope. In\n1908, Peirce wrote to a friend, \u2018I do not say that it is\ninfallibly true that there is any belief to which a person would come\nif he were to carry his inquiries far enough. I only say that that\nalone is what I call Truth\u2019 (cited Haack 1976: 246). \n\nAt the same time, others have criticised Peirce\u2019s account of\ntruth for not being realist enough, due to its \u2018internal\nrealist\u2019 definition of truth in terms of belief and inquiry. Can\nthere not be claims which no-one ever inquires into or believes, which\nare nonetheless true? What about \u2018lost facts\u2019, such as the\nnumber of cakes on a tray during a long-ago party (Johnston 2003: 91)?\nHere Peirce arguably doubles down on his fallibilism (Legg 2014: 211).\nHow can we be sure that no amount of inquiry will settle such\nmatters?\n\n\u2026 it is unphilosophical to suppose that, with regard to any\ngiven question (which has any clear meaning), investigation would not\nbring forth a solution of it, if it were carried far enough\u2026\nWho can be sure of what we shall not know in a few hundred years?\n(EP1: 140)\n\n\nThe objectivism of Peirce\u2019s account of truth derives not from a\nworld entirely external to our minds (a famously difficult thing to\nknow), but from the potential infinity of the community of\ninquiry, which exposes all of our beliefs to future correction:\n\u2018reality is independent, not necessarily of thought in general,\nbut only of what you or I or any finite number of [persons] may think\nabout it\u2026\u2019 (EP1: 139). By means of this mathematical\nanalysis, Peirce deftly synthesises insights from traditional realisms\nand idealisms (Legg 2014: 212; Lane 2018). \n",
