    "main_text": "Rationality and History: Some Basic Questions\n2. Rationality and History: Some Basic Questions\n\nMany of the issues raised by and about historicist conceptions of\nrationality remain unresolved, but the approach has the merit of\nbringing back into discussion several interrelated questions.\n\n What is it to be rational, anyway, once we situate agents in\nreal-life socio-cultural situations?\n Is an account of rationality something discovered rather than\nhumanly constructed?\n Is a theory of rationality something that can be fixed a\npriori, or can it (must it?) be naturalized, in whole or in part,\ni.e., shaped by a broadly empirical mode of inquiry?\n Is there just one, unique, correct conception or theory of\nrationality, of universal applicability?\n Can (should) our concept of rationality be relativized to\nspecifically human capabilities and to specific kinds of\ndecision-action situations, or could it turn out, by some universal\nstandard, perhaps realized by future artificial intelligence or by\n(other) aliens, that we are all terribly non-rational, scientists\nincluded?\n Is scientific rationality special in some way, as distinct from\nrationality in general?\n Is a theory of specifically scientific rationality the same as an\naccount of scientific method? (If so and there is no unique scientific\nmethod, then there is no single, general account of scientific\nrationality either.)\n Is second-order rationality possible, i.e., rational changes in\nscientific goals and standards of rationality themselves?\n Should a metatheory of scientific rationality match the theory of\nfirst-order methodological rules?\n Do we even need a theory of scientific rationality, either to\nexplain research at the microlevel or scientific development at the\nmacrolevel? If so, precisely how does appeal to rationality explain?\nDoes it provide a causal mechanism?\n How is the individual rationality of a researcher related to the\nrationality of the working group and to the community of specialists\nas a whole? In other words, how does (or should) the distribution of\ncognitive labor affect the discussion of rationality?\n Are rationality assessments instantaneous (given the logical or\nmathematical relations of the available information) or do they (at\nleast sometimes) require historical retrospect or prospect?\n What good is the historical study of how basic categories of\ndescription such as \u2018fact\u2019, \u2018experiment\u2019,\n\u2018objective\u2019, \u2018replication\u2019, and \u2018novel\nprediction\u2019 change over time? What does such history tell us, if\nanything, about human inquiry or epistemology?\n What does \u2018historicism\u2019 mean in this context, and\nwhat could a constitutively historicist theory of rationality be?\n\n",
