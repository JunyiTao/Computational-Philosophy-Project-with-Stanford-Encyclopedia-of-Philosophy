    "main_text": "Category Differences\n2. Category Differences\n\nMuch recent work on categories has been influenced by skepticism about\nthe possibility of offering a system of ontological categories.\nDifficulties like those mentioned above have undermined the idea that\na uniquely true and comprehensive system of ontological categories can\nbe found. The skepticism that comes from noting the proliferation of\ncategory systems is compounded by general skepticism about\nmetaphysics. In some cases this has come from imputations of logical\npositivists that all metaphysical talk is nonsense. More recently, the\nskepticism has arisen from general doubts about the epistemology of\nmetaphysics (Bennett 2009, Kriegel 2013, Thomasson 2015), as well as\nmore specific doubts that we can make sense of the idea that the world\nhas a distinctly \u2018ontological structure\u2019, or that we could\ndiscover what that structure is.\n\nAs a result, while categories have continued to play a central role in\nanalytic philosophy in the past century, and while some have continued\nto pursue work on categories in the realist spirit, others have\nshifted their focus to identifying differences in\nsemantic categories rather than drawing out systems\nof ontological categories. Thus when Gilbert Ryle (1949, 1938\n[1971]) talks of categories, he does not speak directly of categories\nof entities, but rather of differing logical types of\nconcepts, where such type differences are detectable by the\nabsurdities that result from substituting in terms of one sort for\nterms of another in sentences of certain kinds (see \u00a72.2 below).\nWilfrid Sellars, developing a strategy of Ockham\u2019s, argues\nexplicitly that we may construe category statements as disguised\nmetalinguistic statements about the conceptual role of certain\nexpressions (and their functional counterparts in other languages).\nAccording to Sellars, \u201cSocrates is a substance\u201d, for\nexample, has the sense of \u201cThe \u00b7Socrates\u00b7 is a\nbasic mental singular term\u201d, and \u201cYellow is a\nquality\u201d has the sense of \u201cThe \u00b7yellow\u00b7 is a\n(one-place) predicate (in mentalese)\u201d (1970 [1974], 328) (where\nthe \u201c\u00b7___\u00b7\u201d notation has the function of\nenabling us to speak about linguistic roles without being tied to a\nparticular natural language). As a result, we can replicate the work\ndone by traditional category distinctions between, e.g., substance and\nquality, without committing ourselves ontologically to the existence\nof qualities or other abstracta (1970 [1974], 329). On Sellars\u2019\nview, the categories are \u201cmetaconceptual, second-order\nfunctional classifications of the most fundamental types of\nfirst-order conceptual roles within a norm-governed linguistic\npractice or conceptual framework\u201d (O\u2019Shea forthcoming,\nsection 1). An interesting upshot of this Sellarsian way of looking at\nthe categories is that are not fixed, but may change over time as the\nconceptual roles in our norm-governed practices change (O\u2019Shea\nforthcoming, section 2).\n",
