    "main_text": "Quantifiers in Justification Logic\n9. Historical Notes\n\n\nThe initial Justification Logic system, the Logic of Proofs\n \\(\\mathsf{LP}\\),\n was introduced in 1995 in (Artemov 1995) (cf. \nalso (Artemov 2001)) where such basic properties as Internalization, \nRealization, arithmetical completeness, were first established.\n\\(\\mathsf{LP}\\) offered an intended\nprovability semantics for G\u00f6del\u2019s provability logic\n \\(\\mathsf{S4}\\),\n thus providing a formalization of Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov\nsemantics for intuitionistic propositional logic. \nEpistemic semantics and completeness (Fitting 2005) were first \nestablished for \\(\\mathsf{LP}\\). \nSymbolic models and decidability for\n \\(\\mathsf{LP}\\)\n are due to Mkrtychev (Mkrtychev 1997). \nComplexity estimates first appeared in (Brezhnev and Kuznets 2006, \nKuznets 2000, Milnikel 2007). A comprehensive overview of all \ndecidability and complexity results can be found in (Kuznets 2008). \nSystems \\(\\mathsf{J} , \\mathsf{J4}\\), and\n \\(\\mathsf{JT}\\)\n were first considered in (Brezhnev \n2001) under different names and in a slightly different setting. \n\\(\\mathsf{JT45}\\) appeared \nindependently in (Pacuit 2006) and (Rubtsova 2006), and\n \\(\\mathsf{JD45}\\) in (Pacuit 2006). The\nlogic of uni-conclusion proofs has been found in (Krupski 1997). \nA more general approach to common knowledge based on justified\nknowledge was offered in (Artemov 2006).  Game\nsemantics of Justification Logic and Dynamic Epistemic Logic with \njustifications were studied in (Renne 2008, Renne 2009). Connections \nbetween Justification Logic and the problem of logical omniscience \nwere examined in (Artemov and Kuznets 2009, Wang 2009).\nThe name Justification Logic was introduced in\n(Artemov 2008), in which Kripke, Russell, and Gettier examples were\nformalized; this formalization has been used for the resolution of\nparadoxes, verification, hidden assumption analysis, and eliminating\nredundancies.  In (Dean and Kurokawa 2009a), Justification Logic was\nused for the analysis of Knower and Knowability paradoxes.\n\n\nThe first two monographs on Justification Logic were published in 2019\n(Artemov and Fitting 2019, Kuznets and Studer 2019).\n",
