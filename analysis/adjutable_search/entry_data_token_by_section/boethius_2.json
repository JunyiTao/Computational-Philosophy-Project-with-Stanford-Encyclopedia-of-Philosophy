    "main_text": "The Logical Text-Books\n3. The Logical Text-Books\n\nThe two most interesting of Boethius\u2019s logical text-books are\nthe treatises on topical differentiae (c. 522\u20133) and on\nhypothetical syllogisms (516\u201322), since each gives an insight\ninto an area of late ancient logic for which there are otherwise few,\nif any, sources.\n\nFrom Aristotle\u2019s Topics, logicians of late antiquity\nhad elaborated a system of topical argument, which had been\nconsiderably influenced by the needs of Roman lawyers. The focus of\ntopical theory is on discovering arguments, and these\narguments are not usually formally valid, but merely plausible. The\ntopical differentiae are the classifications of types of such\narguments; knowing the differentiae gives the arguer a ready\nmeans to hit upon a persuasive line of reasoning. Suppose, for\nexample, I want to argue that we should praise Cicero. I start trying\nto think what information I have which might help me to argue this\npoint, and I remember that everyone is full of praises for another\norator, Demosthenes. Then I turn over in my mind the list of topical\ndifferentiae and I see that the differentia\n\u2018from equals\u2019 will provide me with the argument I\nneed:\n\nEveryone praises Demosthenes as an orator.\nCicero is Demosthenes\u2019s equal as an orator.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nEveryone should praise Cicero.\n\n\nAssociated with this, as with every differentia, is a\n\u2018maximal sentence\u2019 (maxima propositio), in this\ncase: \u2018equal things are to be judged equally.\u2019 The maximal\nsentence can be taken as an indication of how to put together the\nargument; it might also be added to the argument in order to make it\nformally valid, but Boethius did not envisage maximal sentences being\nused in this way. Rather, the topical arguer produces arguments of\ndiffering strength, depending on how close to being a logical truth is\nthe maximal sentence associated with the differentia he is\nusing. Some maximal sentences do indeed state fundamental laws of\nreasoning (including modus ponens and modus\ntollens); others state what are at best rules of thumb and, in\nthe case of the topic \u2018from authority\u2019\u2014the\ninjunction to accept as true what the wise, or experts or the majority\nbelieve\u2014not even that.\n\nBoethius\u2019s two main authorities, Cicero and Themistius, give\nrather different lists of the topical differentiae, and one\nof the tasks of his text-book is to show that their schemes do really\ncoincide. In his commentary on Cicero\u2019s Topics, written\nshortly before, Boethius expounds the same theory, but leaves himself\nplenty of room for digressions on such subjects as universals,\ncausation, free will and Stoic logic.\n\nIt is Stoic logic and Boethius\u2019s relations to it which give his\ntreatise On hypothetical syllogisms its special interest. A\nsyllogism is \u2018hypothetical\u2019 when one of its premisses is a\nmolecular sentence which uses \u2018if\u2019 or \u2018or\u2019\n(understood as exclusive disjunction) as a connective. So, for\nexample, the following syllogism is hypothetical:\n\nIf it is day, it is light.\nIt is not light.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is not day.\n\n\nA modern reader will be inclined to see (4\u20136) as a piece of\nsimple sentence logic: p\u2192q; \u00acq; therefore\n\u00acp. Since it was the Stoics who, in antiquity, developed\na sentence logic, by contrast with Aristotle\u2019s term logic, it\nwould appear that Boethius\u2019s treatise on hypothetical syllogisms\nis the tributary of Stoic logic. This conclusion is true to the extent\nthat the tradition Boethius inherited goes back in part to Stoic\nroots. By the time it had reached Boethius, however, Stoic and\nPeripatetic elements had become hopelessly confused (cf. Speca 2001).\nAs C.J. Martin (1991) has shown, Boethius himself lacked the\nconceptual apparatus to think in terms of sentence logic. For him,\n(4\u20136) is to be understood as term logic, in which the predicates\n\u2018is light\u2019 and \u2018is day\u2019 are attributed to or\ndenied of a vague subject \u2018it\u2019. The treatise itself is\nmainly devoted to a laborious calculation of the various different\npossible forms of hypothetical syllogism involving two, three (with a\nfirst premise such as \u2018If it is A, then if it is\nB, it is C\u2019) and four terms (with a first\npremise such as \u2018If, if it is A then it is B,\nthen, if it is C then it is D\u2019).\n",
