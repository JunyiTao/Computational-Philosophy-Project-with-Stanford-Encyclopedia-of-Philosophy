    "main_text": "Ethics: Virtue for the Sake of Happiness\n4. Political Theory: Ethocracy\n\n\nHolbach\u2019s political theory, which he developed for the most part after\nhis metaphysics and ethics, extends his ethical views to the state.\nHaving described human interest as happiness and preservation in the\nSystem of Nature and Common Sense in 1770 and 1772,\nHolbach went on to develop a notion of the just state or, to use his\nown term, \u201cethocracy,\u201d founded for the purposes of securing the general\nwelfare. This theory is presented in several works published during the\n1770s, La politique naturelle (Natural Politics,\n1773), Syst\u00e8me social (The Social System,\n1773), La morale universelle (Universal Morality,\n1776), and Ethocratie (Ethocracy, 1776). Holbach\u2019s\nfoundational view is that the most valuable thing a person seeking\nself-preservation can do is to unite with another person: \u201cMan is of\nall beings the most necessary to man\u201d (Syst\u00e8me social,\n76; cf. Spinoza\u2019s Ethics IVP35C1, C2, and S). Society, when it\nis just, unites for the common purpose of preservation and the securing\nof welfare, and society contracts with government for this purpose. \n\n\nHolbach\u2019s theory of social contract has two stages. The first is\nsocial. When individuals realize that others are the greatest helps to\ntheir own welfare, they make a pact with one another, uniting in order\nto obtain personal and proprietary security and other benefits of\nsociety (Universal Morality 1.86; Politique\nNaturelle, 1.1). To strike such a pact is part of each person\u2019s\nreason:\nHelp me\u2026and I will help you with all my talents..work for\nmy happiness if you want me to concern myself with yours\u2026Secure for\nme advantages great enough to persuade me to give up to you a part of\nthose which I possess. [Politique Naturelle 1.1, Ladd\u2019s\ntranslation]\n\n\nThis social contract, the contract between individuals in society, is\nnever broken. \n\n\nThe second stage of the social contract is more narrowly political.\nIt is a contract that society, in order to secure the general welfare,\nstrikes with a sovereign power, usually understood by Holbach to be a\nking limited, or at least informed by, a body of elected\nrepresentatives (La politique naturelle 3.17). This second\nsocial contract for Holbach, as for Locke, may be broken. Holbach is a\nthoroughgoing utilitarian: where the government fails to secure the\ngeneral welfare, which consists principally in securing property and\nbasic freedoms such as the freedoms of speech and religion, society has\na right to revolution (La politique naturelle, 4.5).\n\n\nPerhaps because of the less cautious advocacy of right to revolution\namong other members of his coterie, particularly Naigeon, or perhaps\nbecause he criticized the kings of his time so fiercely, Holbach is\nsometimes regarded as an advocate of revolution. Holbach\u2019s\ndiscussion is tentative, however. He describes the right in La\npolitique naturelle (4.5 ff.) as a product of the natural\ninstinct for self-preservation. Like Hobbes (Leviathan, XXIX,\n23), Holbach expects that obedience to a sovereign will break down\nwhere individuals feel the need to secure their own lives. This is\nalso why sovereigns need to take care to look after citizens\u2019\nwelfare and education. Where they fail to do these things, citizens\ncome to be ruled not by reason but by passion, and revolution\nresults. Holbach\u2019s right to revolution, then, is less an\nadvocacy of revolution than a warning to avoid the conditions that\nlead to it.\n",
