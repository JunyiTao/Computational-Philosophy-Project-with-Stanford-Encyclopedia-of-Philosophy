    "main_text": "Knowledge as Justified True Belief || The Belief Condition\n1.2 The Belief Condition\n\nThe belief condition is only slightly more controversial than the\ntruth condition. The general idea behind the belief condition is that\nyou can only know what you believe. Failing to believe something\nprecludes knowing it. \u201cBelief\u201d in the context of the JTB\ntheory means full belief, or outright belief. In a\nweak sense, one might \u201cbelieve\u201d something by virtue of\nbeing pretty confident that it\u2019s probably true\u2014in this\nweak sense, someone who considered Clinton the favourite to win the\nelection, even while recognizing a nontrivial possibility of her\nlosing, might be said to have \u201cbelieved\u201d that Clinton would win.\nOutright belief is stronger (see, e.g., Fantl & McGrath 2009: 141;\nNagel 2010: 413\u20134; Williamson 2005: 108; or Gibbons 2013: 201.).\nTo believe outright that p, it isn\u2019t enough to have a\npretty high confidence in p; it is something closer to a\ncommitment or a being\n sure.[4]\n\nAlthough initially it might seem obvious that knowing that p\nrequires believing that p, a few philosophers have argued that\nknowledge without belief is indeed possible. Suppose Walter comes home\nafter work to find out that his house has burned down. He says:\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d. Critics of the belief\ncondition might argue that Walter knows that his house has burned down\n(he sees that it has), but, as his words indicate, he does not believe\nit. The standard response is that Walter\u2019s avowal of disbelief\nis not literally true; what Walter wishes to convey by saying \u201cI\ndon\u2019t believe it\u201d is not that he really does not believe\nthat his house has burned down, but rather that he finds it hard to\ncome to terms with what he sees. If he genuinely didn\u2019t believe\nit, some of his subsequent actions, such as phoning his insurance\ncompany, would be rather mysterious.\n\nA more serious counterexample has been suggested by Colin Radford\n(1966). Suppose Albert is quizzed on English history. One of the\nquestions is: \u201cWhen did Queen Elizabeth die?\u201d Albert\ndoesn\u2019t think he knows, but answers the question correctly.\nMoreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to which he\ndidn\u2019t think he knew the answer. Let us focus on Albert\u2019s\nanswer to the question about Elizabeth:\n\n(E)Elizabeth died in\n1603.\n\n\nRadford makes the following two claims about this example:\n\nAlbert does not believe (E).\nAlbert knows (E).\n\n\nRadford\u2019s intuitions about cases like these do not seem to be\nidiosyncratic; Myers-Schutz & Schwitzgebel (2013) find evidence\nsuggesting that many ordinary speakers tend to react in the way\nRadford suggests. In support of (a), Radford emphasizes that Albert\nthinks he doesn\u2019t know the answer to the question. He\ndoesn\u2019t trust his answer because he takes it to be a mere guess.\nIn support of (b), Radford argues that Albert\u2019s answer is not at\nall just a lucky guess. The fact that he answers most of the questions\ncorrectly indicates that he has actually learned, and never forgotten,\nsuch historical facts.\n\nSince he takes (a) and (b) to be true, Radford holds that belief is not necessary for knowledge. But either of (a) and (b) might be resisted. One might deny (a), arguing that Albert does have a tacit belief that (E), even though it\u2019s not one that he thinks amounts to knowledge. David Rose and Jonathan Schaffer (2013) take this route. Alternatively, one might deny (b), arguing that Albert\u2019s correct answer is not an expression of knowledge, perhaps because, given his subjective position, he does not have justification for believing (E). The justification condition is the topic of the next section.\n \n",
