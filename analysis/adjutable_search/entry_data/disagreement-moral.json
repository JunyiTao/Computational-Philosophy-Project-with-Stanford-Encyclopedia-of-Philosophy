    "preamble": "\n\n\nAppeals to moral disagreement have figured in philosophical\ndiscussions since antiquity, especially regarding questions about the\nnature of morality. An example is provided by Sextus Empiricus, who in\na famous passage concludes (in Richard Bett\u2019s translation) that\n\u201cthere is nothing by nature good or bad\u201d from the\nobservation that \u201cthe same thing is thought bad by one person and\ngood by another\u201d (Against the Ethicists, 14). It is\noften dubious to characterize the thoughts of ancient philosophers by\nusing distinctions and terminologies that have emerged much later.\nStill, it is tempting to take Sextus to offer an argument against the\nmetaethical position known as \u201cmoral realism\u201d and its\ncentral thesis that there are moral truths which are objective in the\nsense that they are independent of human practices and thinking.\n\n\nMoral realism is the target also of many modern appeals to moral\ndisagreement which are often made by philosophers who instead favor\nnihilist, relativist, constructivist, non-cognitivist or expressivist\nviews. However, the phenomenon has been ascribed other dialectical\nroles as well. For example, it has also been invoked in support of\nrealism. Metaethics is furthermore not the only domain in which moral\ndisagreement has received attention. Another is political philosophy.\nAn influential view which is known as \u201cpublic reason\u201d\nentails that a government\u2019s use of coercive power is legitimate\nonly if it can be justified to the citizens on the basis of principles\nthat all could reasonably accept. That view provides a different context in\nwhich facts about moral disagreement are relevant (see Quong 2018 for\nan overview and discussion). Nevertheless, this entry is exclusively devoted\nto its metaethical significance.\n\n\nSome of the topics metaethicists address concern the metaphysics and\nontology of morality. Others concern its epistemology and its semantics\n(and metasemantics). Moral disagreement has been thought relevant to\nall those subfields, and the entry is organized in accordance with the\ndivisions among them. However, one of the points the discussions below\nare meant to illustrate is that the topics are related and that\nthe positions and arguments that have been put forward in one of the\nsubfields might be relevant also to those in another.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Nature of Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThere is little controversy about the existence of widespread\ndisagreement over moral issues, both within and between societies and\ncultures. Often used examples are the debates about the morality of the\ndeath penalty, of euthanasia, of abortion, and of meat-eating. Examples\nof cultural differences include infanticide and geronticide and other\nmore or less alien practices that historians and anthropologists have\nrevealed. For example, Napoleon Chagnon\u2019s account of the ways of\nthe Yanomam\u00f6 people in the Amazon basin is a popular source of\nillustrations (Chagnon 1997, but see also Tierney 2003 for a critical\ndiscussion). Some theorists assign special weight to disagreements\namong philosophers and professional ethicists who have engaged in\nsystematic reflection about moral issues (e.g., Wong 1984, ch. 10 and\nLeiter 2014). What they have in mind are, among other disputes, those\nbetween utilitarians and Kantians about what makes an action morally\nright and those between egalitarians and libertarians about what\njustice requires. How deep the disagreement goes, however, and how it\nis best explained, are disputed questions. So is another topic which in\na way precedes the others, namely, what it is, more\nspecifically, to disagree morally.\n1.1 Conflicts of Belief or Clashes of Conative Attitudes?\n\n\nPeople disagree morally when they have opposing moral convictions.\nThat much can be agreed by all theorists. What is debated is rather\nwhat it means for such convictions to be opposing. For example, moral\nrealism entails cognitivism, and cognitivism is the view that moral\nsentences\u2014the sentences we typically use to express our moral\nconvictions\u2014can be true and false and that the convictions\nthemselves constitute beliefs that purport to represent aspects of\nreality. That element of their position allows realists to construe\nmoral disagreements as conflicts of belief along the lines of disputes\nabout (other) factual matters, i.e., as cases where persons give\ninconsistent verdicts on one and the same truth-evaluable claim or\nproposition. On that conception, if Jane thinks that meat-eating is\nmorally wrong while Eric denies so then they have incompatible beliefs\nboth of which cannot be true, just as when Jane believes while Eric\ndenies that the Earth is older than four thousand years.\n\n\nTo construe moral disagreements in that way is not, however, an\noption for those non-cognitivists who deny that moral convictions are\nbeliefs and think that to judge that meat-eating is wrong is\ninstead to have a conative attitude towards meat-eating (such as an\nattitude of dislike or a desire). Theorists of that kind rather\nconceive of the opposition that a moral disagreement involves as a\nclash of such attitudes (see, e.g., Stevenson 1944; and Blackburn 1984,\n168). What the clash more specifically is supposed to consist in\ndepends on which version of non-cognitivism one is considering. If\nmoral convictions are taken to be desires, for example, then a moral\ndisagreement can be construed as a case where people have desires which\nare not jointly satisfiable and thus motivate different courses\nof\n action.[1]\n1.2 Relativist Accounts\n\n\nThe fact that moral realists are cognitivists enables them to\nconstrue moral disagreements as conflicts of belief, but some\ncognitivists may also, just like non-cognitivists, need a conception\nwhich is different from the realist one. Moral realism is associated\nwith the absolutist view that the truth conditions or contents of moral\nsentences and moral convictions remain constant across speakers. For\nexample, the realist Richard Boyd insists that there is \u201ca single\nobjective property which we\u2019re all talking about when we use the\nterm \u2018good\u2019 in moral contexts\u201d (1988, 312). However,\nthere are also cognitivists who are relativists and think that the\ntruth conditions of moral sentences vary, depending for example on the\ncultural or social groups which the speakers or believers belong to\n(see, e.g., Harman 1978 and Wong 1984).\n\n\nA crude version of relativism is the simple type of subjectivism\nwhich holds that to state that an action is right or wrong is to report\nsomething about one\u2019s own attitudes towards it. On such a view, if Jane states that meat-eating\nis wrong while Eric claims that it is permitted, then Jane expresses\nthe belief that she disapproves of meat-eating while Eric expresses the\nbelief that he does not disapprove of it. Since both those beliefs can\nbe true, they are not incompatible. A common objection to subjectivism\nis that it therefore, implausibly, represents paradigm cases of moral\ndisagreement as being merely apparent (Moore 1912, ch. 3), which\nillustrates how facts that have to do with moral disagreement can help\na moral realist.\n\n\nSimilar objections can be raised against other forms of relativism,\nalthough it may be easier for some of them to construe cases of moral\ndisagreement as conflicts of belief than for others. For example, on\none type of relativist view, what a speaker claims by stating that an\nact is right is, roughly, that it is permitted by his or her moral\nstandards. So, if the speaker\u2019s claim is rejected by someone who\nshares those standards, then they do after all have incompatible\nbeliefs (for this point, see Harman 1978; and Lo\u0301pez de Sa 2015).\nDisagreements between persons who do not share standards remain to be\naccounted for, however.\n\n\nIn response to such objections, relativists can dissociate\nthemselves from the conception that a moral disagreement essentially\ninvolves a conflict of belief and instead adopt the non-cognitivist\nview which takes such disagreements to be clashes of conative\nattitudes. They may do so, for example, by assuming that the moral\nstandards of a person consist in such attitudes (see, e.g., Wong 1984;\nDreier 1999; Bjo\u0308rnsson and Finlay 2010 and Marques 2014). That\nwould enable them to describe the situation with Jane and Eric as a\ngenuine moral dispute even if they concede that Jane\u2019s and\nEric\u2019s statements about the morality of meat-eating can both be\ntrue. One might think that a relativist who chooses that path is left\nwith little reason to remain a cognitivist. But there are further forms\nof relativism that allow for other options.\n\n\nSome of those are explored in the debate regarding so-called\nfaultless disagreements (e.g., K\u00f6lbel 2003 and McFarlane 2014, ch.\n6). On a view which is inspired by the more general position known as\n\u201cassessor relativism\u201d, the propositions that constitute the\ncontents of moral beliefs are the same independently of who the\nbeliever is. But the truth-values of those contents nevertheless vary\ndepending on the standards of those who assess them (e.g., K\u00f6lbel\n2004; and Schafer 2012). That view allows its advocates to remain\nfaithful to their relativist inclinations and still construe\nJane\u2019s and Eric\u2019s dispute as concerning one and the same\nproposition which is affirmed by Jane and rejected by Eric. It also\nallows them to claim that, for any spectator of the case, at most one\nof Jane\u2019s and Eric\u2019s statements is true (since both cannot\nbe true relative to the same standards). This leaves them with a\nconception of a moral disagreement which has at least some semblance to\nthe realist one. (For further discussion and criticism of the pertinent\naccount of disagreement, see Dreier 1999; and Franc\u00e9n 2010.)\n\n\nThe fact that different theorists thus ultimately employ different\nideas about what a moral disagreement amounts to may make one suspect\nthat they risk talking past each other when discussing further\nquestions, such as how much disagreement there is and how it is to be\nexplained. However, note that the disputes in question take place at a\nquite theoretical level and are consistent with significant overlap\nregarding what counts as a paradigm case of moral disagreement and\nabout the types of behavior such disagreements typically manifest\nitself in. For example, both realists, non-cognitivists and others can\nagree that moral disagreements are typically accompanied with clashes\nof desires and that they are often causally rooted in conflicts of\nnon-moral belief (for example regarding the consequences of the\nactions). That overlap helps to secure a shared subject matter for\ndiscussions about (e.g.) how much disagreement there is.\n1.3 Radical Moral Disagreements\n\n\nAll moral disagreements are not created equal from a metaethical\npoint of view, as some types are held to be more interesting than\nothers. This has partly to do with the fact that philosophers who\ninvoke moral disagreement in support of antirealist positions typically\nwant to avoid committing themselves to similar positions about other\nareas where disagreement occurs, such as the empirical sciences.\nOvergeneralization worries of that kind are addressed in section 6. But\na common response to them is to argue that there are crucial\ndifferences between disagreement over moral issues and that which\noccurs in the other areas.\n\n\nOn one such suggestion, many moral disagreements are particularly\npervasive and hard to resolve. The disagreements which arise for\nexample in the sciences can generally, it is held, be attributed to a\nlack of evidence, bias, limited reasoning skills or similar cognitive\nshortcomings and tend to go away when progress has been made in\nremoving those obstacles. That situation, however, is contrasted with\nthe one which is supposed to obtain in ethics, where many disagreements\nallegedly would survive such measures and persist even if none of its\nparties were affected by any factor which could plausibly be regarded\nas an epistemic shortcoming. That is, the idea is that disagreements\nwould persist even in circumstances that are ideal in the sense that\nthey are the most favorable circumstances that human inquirers can hope\nto achieve. This is why some theorists assign special weight to\ndisagreements among philosophers, who presumably are the most likely\ncandidates of being in such circumstances, given their training,\nfamiliarity with each other\u2019s arguments, and the time they have\nspent on reflecting on the issues.\n\n\nIn what follows, a moral disagreement that would persist in ideal\ncircumstances is called \u201cradical\u201d. The claim that much of\nthe existing moral disagreement is radical is a premise in some\narguments from moral disagreement, although different arguments explain\nits significance differently. It should be noted, however, that there\nare also arguments which invoke weaker assumptions about the nature of\nthe existing disagreement and do not require that any of it is radical\n(as is illustrated below).\n\n\nRealists tend to agree with antirealists that radical moral\ndisagreements are the most troublesome (see, e.g., Parfit 2011, 546),\nbut they question the grounds for postulating such disagreements. They\nmight in that context use several complementary strategies. One, which\nmay be especially applicable to intercultural differences, is to argue\nthat some disagreements are in fact merely apparent. Thus, polygamy is\njudged acceptable in some societies but deemed unacceptable in others.\nIf each of those judgments contains an implicit indexical element,\ngiven which it holds only for the society in which it is held, then\nthey are not incompatible. Indeed, if the conditions that obtain in\nthose societies are different, then the situation is consistent with\nassuming that certain more basic principles are accepted in all\nsocieties, from which the differing views about polygamy could be\nderived. (This possibility is noted by John Mackie, who however\ndownplays its importance, see 1977, 37.)\n\n\nAnother strategy is to insist that many moral disagreements can\nafter all be attributed to factors that are analogous to those that\nunderlie scientific ones (e.g., Smith 1994, 155\u2013161) or to related\nfactors that are supposed to be especially pertinent to moral inquiry\n(for a rich account of both options, see Brink 1989, ch. 7). For\nexample, it is often noted that moral disputes are frequently rooted in\ndisagreement about non-moral facts (e.g., Boyd 1988, 213), such as when\npeople have opposing views about the death penalty because of different\nbeliefs about the effects of permitting it. Those cases do arguably not\nprovide any particular problem for moral realism and can be seen as\ninstances of disagreement which is due to a lack of evidence. A further\ndistorting factor is self-interest, whose influence may make people\nresist plausible moral views just because those views represent them or\nthe behavior they want to engage in as immoral. That mechanism may help\nto explain why there is more disagreement in ethics than in areas where\nself-interest is less of an issue (see Nagel 1986, 148; and\nShafer-Landau 2006, 219 for this suggestion). Yet further examples are\nbias and prejudice, lack of imagination, and, as for example David\nBrink has stressed (1989, 197\u2013210), an insufficient amount of\nsystematic reflection. In specifically addressing the lack of\nconvergence among ethicists, Derek Parfit has made the congenial\nsuggestion that it is premature to draw antirealist conclusions from\nit, as secular moral reasoning has been pursued for a relatively short\ntime (1984, 454). The suggestion is that fruitful moral inquiry has\nbeen constrained by religious influences in ways that do not promote\ntruth-seeking, just as research about empirical issues was similarly\nhampered before the scientific revolution. According to Parfit, this\nmeans that it is not irrational to be hopeful about future convergence\nof the very same kind that occurs in the sciences (see also Wedgewood\n2014 for a discussion of disagreement among philosophers). The list of\navailable strategies could be extended, and the question, in the\ncontext of the assessment of some (but not all) arguments from moral\ndisagreement, is what scope their application leaves for postulating\nany remaining ones.\n2. Empirical Research on Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThe question about the extent to which the existing moral\ndisagreement is radical is essentially an empirical one. Yet references\nin the philosophical discussion to the numerous studies by\nanthropologists, historians, psychologists and sociologists who have\ndocumented the disagreement are relatively\n sparse.[2]\nThis may seem regrettable, and some have\naccordingly emphasized that philosophers should pay more attention to\nempirical research (see, e.g., Sturgeon 1994, 230 and Loeb 1998, 284).\nThat is surely good advice, but the absence of references to the\nempirical literature is also to some extent understandable.\n\n\nOne reason for this is that much of the philosophical discussion\nfocuses on the implications of the claim that much moral disagreement\nis radical, rather than on the truth of that claim. Another is that\nsome arguments merely appeal to the possibility of radical\nmoral disagreement and are consistent with thinking that all actual\ndisputes involve some shortcoming. (See e.g., Tolhurst 1987, and Wright\n1992 and 1996. See also the references to antirealists who use thought\nexperiments of the type considered in section\n 5.)[3]\nThat approach raises methodological questions of its\nown, of course, especially if one is not willing to extend one\u2019s\nantirealism to all other domains. For then one must explain how one can\nestablish that disagreements of the pertinent kind are possible in\nethics but not in the other domains. The role empirical evidence might\nhave in that context is a complex issue.\n\n\nA further reason for the absence of references to empirical studies\nin the metaethical literature is that their relevance is often unclear,\npartly since the studies have typically not been guided by the rather\nspecific concerns that philosophers reflect on (such as whether the\ndisagreement is radical). However, that might be better seen as a\nreason to scrutinize those studies more carefully than to ignore them\naltogether. It may also be a reason for philosophers to take a more\nactive role in the empirical research themselves and to find ways to\ncollaborate with those who are trained in those areas.\n\n\nSome important efforts along those lines have in fact been made. A\nprominent example is Richard Brandt\u2019s study (1954) of the Hopi\npeople, which revealed differences in basic moral attitudes between the\nHopi and white Americans that could not, he thought, be explained with\ndifferences in non-moral beliefs. (See Moody-Adams 1997 for a critique,\nand Abarbanell and Hauser 2010 and Barrett et al. 2016 for two more\nrecent examples.) An attempt to argue that there is empirical evidence\nfor the existence of radical moral disagreement that has been widely\ndiscussed in recent years has been made by John Doris, Alexandra\nPlakias and Stephen Stich (Doris and Plakias 2008a; Doris and Plakias\n2008b, and Doris and Stich 2007). They appeal to research conducted by\nthe social psychologists Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett (1996) about why\ncertain types of violence among non-Hispanic whites are more common in\nthe American South than in the North. Cohen and Nisbett attribute this\ndifference to the existence in the South of a \u201cculture of\nhonor\u201d, which permits harsh responses even to minor insults. As\nfor why such a culture is more prevalent there, Cohen and Nisbett point\nto the fact that early European migrants to the United States settled\nin different regions. Many who went to the South were descendants of\npeople whose morals had been forged in herding economies (in Scotland,\nfor example), where a reputation for being prone to violent retaliation\nlessened the risk of having one\u2019s cattle stolen.\n\n\nDoris et al. argue that the difference Cohen and Nisbett have\nrevealed is a plausible candidate of a disagreement which would persist\nunder ideal conditions, as it is unreasonable to attribute it to\nunawareness of non-moral facts or to other obvious types of distorting\nfactors. But they also acknowledge the tentativeness of their\ncontention and that there are further options for those who want to\nexplain away the difference (see, e.g., Doris et al. 2020). One is to\npursue the aforementioned suggestion by Brink (see also Loeb 1998) to\nthe effect that the failure to expose one\u2019s moral beliefs to\ntheoretical reflection is a shortcoming. The type of reflection he has\nin mind is associated with a reflective equilibrium-style method for\nmoral inquiry, which prescribes the pursuit of coherence and\nsystematicity. Arguably, the evidence presented by Cohen and Nisbett is\nnot enough to confidently conclude that the disagreements would survive\ncompetent applications of that method. (See Fitzpatrick 2014. For\nfurther discussion, see Tersman 2006, ch. 2; Bloomfield 2008; and\nFraser and Hauser 2010.)\n\n\nThe idea that an insufficient amount of reflection counts as a\nshortcoming may justify focusing especially on disagreements among\nphilosophers, as Brian Leiter (2014) does. But a problem is that the\navailable characterizations of the pertinent method of reflection are\nrather vague. It may therefore be hard to determine whether\nany individual has applied it competently or not. Moreover,\nhow any such method is to be specified, and even if it is to be used at\nall, are controversial issues within philosophy. Something similar\nholds for other potential candidates of relevant shortcomings. For\nexample, what about cases where our moral convictions are influenced by\nour emotions? It is common to view such influence as a distorting\nfactor (e.g., Singer 2005 and Sayre-McCord 2015), but on some views in\nmoral epistemology, and given the benign roles emotions sometimes play\nin cognitive processes, it may need to be qualified (see Le Doux 1996\nand Nussbaum 2001 for two influential accounts of the epistemic\nsignificance of emotions). Before those and many related issues are\nsettled, and thus before we have established a comprehensive list of\nclearly defined factors which count as shortcomings, all confident\nestimates of the extent to which the existing moral disagreement is\nradical may seem premature.\n3. Metaphysical Arguments from Moral Disagreement\n3.1 The Argument from Relativity\n\n\nMuch of the contemporary metaethical discussion about moral\ndisagreement is inspired by John Mackie\u2019s \u201cargument from\nrelativity\u201d, which is offered in support of his nihilist\nmetaphysical claim that there are no moral facts. Mackie\u2019s\nargument is often interpreted as an inference to the best explanation.\nOn that interpretation, the existence of widespread moral disagreement\nsupports the thesis that there are no moral facts because it is implied\nby the best explanation of the disagreement. However, although that\nconstrual of Mackie\u2019s argument is quite common (e.g., Brink 1989,\n197; McGrath 2008, 90; Joyce 2010, 46 (but see also Joyce 2018); Vavova\n2014, 304; and Clarke-Doane 2020, 148), it is also questionable.\n\n\nMackie\u2019s brief presentation of his argument begins as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe argument from relativity has as its premiss the well-known\nvariation in moral codes from one society to another and from one\nperiod to another, and also the differences in moral beliefs between\ndifferent groups and classes within a complex community (1977,\n36).\n\n\nHe acknowledges that there is no direct step from the diversity to\nthe conclusion that there are no moral facts and stresses that the\ndisputes which occur in the sciences do not support analogous\nconclusions about them. To justify this mixed verdict, he stresses\nthat, while \u201cscientific disagreement results from speculative\ninferences or explanatory hypotheses based on inadequate\nevidence\u201d (1977, 36), moral disagreement should be explained in a\ndifferent way:\n\n\n[T]he argument from relativity has some force simply because the\nactual variations in the moral codes are more readily explained by the\nhypothesis that they reflect ways of life than by the hypothesis that\nthey express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly\ndistorted, of objective values. (1977, 37)\n\n\nWhat makes it questionable to construe Mackie\u2019s argument as an\ninference to the best explanation is that his way-of-life explanation\nseems completely neutral as to the existence of moral facts. The\naccount is illustrated by the claim that \u201cpeople approve of\nmonogamy because they participate in a monogamous life\u201d rather\nthan the other way round, and that view is surely consistent both with\nthe existence and the non-existence of moral facts. It is accordingly\nhard to see how the alleged superiority of Mackie\u2019s way of\nlife-explanation of moral diversity confirms the idea that it is best\nexplained by assuming that moral facts do not exist.\n\n\nWhen exploring the possibility of an alternative reconstruction, it\nis helpful to distinguish between two claims:\n\nThe best explanation of the variation in moral codes\nentails that there are no moral facts.\nThe best explanation of the variation in moral codes does not\nentail that there are moral facts.\n\n\n\nGiven the neutrality of Mackie\u2019s way of life-account relative\nto the existence of moral facts, the supposition that it offers a\nsuperior explanation of the variation does not imply (i). However, it\ndoes imply the weaker claim (ii), which is what Mackie notes by\ncontrasting the way of life-account with \u201cthe hypothesis that\n[our moral convictions] express perceptions, most of them seriously\ninadequate and badly distorted, of objective values\u201d. Can (ii) be\nused in a compelling objection to moral realism? One option is to try\nfor an indirect one which targets the grounds for being a realist,\nrather than realism itself. (ii) does not entail that the variation is\na direct reason to reject realism, but it does indicate that realism\nfails to obtain support from it. That is obviously an unsurprising\nresult, but if the way-of-life hypothesis is incorporated in a broader\ntheory, which provides the best explanation also of other aspects of\nmoral discourse, then it may deprive realists of more important sources\nof support. For example, some moral realists (e.g., Sturgeon 1988, 229,\nSmith 1994, 188, and Huemer 2016) stress that although there is plenty\nof moral disagreement, there is also some amount of convergence. Issues\nthat previously were intensely debated are currently less controversial\n(Smith mentions slavery, for example). The inspiration of these\nrealists may be the arguments for scientific realism which invoke the\n(arguably more impressive) convergence that occurs there (see Devitt\n1984 for a discussion). However, if a theory which incorporates the\nway-of-life hypothesis and at the same time remains non-committal about\nmoral facts were to provide a better explanation not only of the\ndivergence but also of the convergence among moral judgments, then\narguments for moral realism of that kind would fail. If the broader\ntheory were in addition to explain why we form moral convictions in the\nfirst place, then it would provide significant support for the core\nclaim of Gilbert Harman\u2019s much discussed argument against moral\nrealism, according to which we should not posit moral facts, as they\nare not needed in the best explanation of anything observable. (See\nHarman 1977 and Sturgeon 1988 for a realist response.)\n3.2 Disagreement and Inaccessibility\n\n\nOf course, the role such a reconstruction of Mackie\u2019s argument\nassigns to moral disagreement is exceedingly limited, so it hardly\naccounts for the attention that moral disagreement has received in the\ndebate about moral realism. Can the argument be reconstructed in a more\ndirect way? As several commentators have pointed out, what might be\nneeded is an epistemic premise (e.g., Bennigson 1996; Loeb 1998;\nTersman 2006, ch. 3, Enoch 2009; and Locke 2017). The question is what\nthe existence of moral facts predicts about existing moral\ndisagreement, and the problem is that it is hard to see how it\ngenerates any such predictions on its own. Further assumptions are\nneeded, and one candidate is the idea that the facts, if they exist,\nare accessible to us in the sense that we can in favorable epistemic\ncircumstances acquire knowledge of them. David Wiggins has formulated\nthe idea as follows: \u201cIf X is true, then X will under favourable\ncircumstances command convergence\u201d (1987, 147). Given such a\nclaim, one could then argue that moral realism predicts less\ndisagreement (in the relevant circumstances) than that which actually\nexists. This would be a direct reason to reject it.\n\n\nThis alternative construal of the argument leaves realists with the\noption of denying that the moral facts they posit are accessible.\nHowever, that is a move realists are typically not inclined to make. A\npersuasive argument to the effect that moral realists are committed to\nviewing moral facts as inaccessible would rather be seen as an\nembarrassment, as it would leave them, to use Russ\nShafer-Landau\u2019s phrase, with \u201ca logically coherent position\nthat contains about zero appeal\u201d. (2012, 1). Indeed, some\nrealists even make the claim that moral facts are epistemically\naccessible a part of their definition of the position (Boyd 1988, 182).\nA more common response is therefore to try to find ways to reconcile\nthe existing disagreement both with the existence and with the\naccessibility of moral facts.\n\n\nThe prospects of such a response depend on what the accessibility is\ntaken to entail. There may be little reason for realists to go beyond\nthe relatively modest claim that we can attain knowledge of some moral\nfacts in favorable circumstances. Given such a weak interpretation of\n\u201caccessible\u201d, realists may employ all the strategies\noutlined in section 1.3 to argue that most of the existing disagreement\noccurs between persons who are not in ideal circumstances which would\nrender it irrelevant in the present context. After all, the fact that\npeople have failed to reach agreement (which entails, on a realist\nview, that some have failed to obtain knowledge) in conditions that are\nnot favorable need not show that they would fail also in\ncircumstances that are. As for the remaining disagreement,\nsuch as that between philosophers, realists could point out that it\nprimarily concerns highly general and theoretical facts whose\naccessibility they can consistently remain agnostic about, for example\ndue to underdetermination concerns.\n\n\nIn addition, realists may in fact concede that some contested moral\nissues do not allow for objectively correct answers and thus grant some\namount of indeterminacy in the moral realm. The idea is that they may\ndo so and still insist that other moral questions have such answers, by\nattributing the indeterminacy to vagueness which in turn may be the\nresult of the applicability of incommensurable values or requirements\n(see, e.g., Brink 1989, 202; Sturgeon 1994, 95; and Shafer-Landau 1994\nand 1995). That proposal has received some attention (e.g.,\nConstantinescu 2012 and 2014) and deserves further examination.\nHowever, a potential concern with it is that the set of moral issues\nwhich may most plausibly be taken to involve vagueness might not\noverlap so well with the set of issues over which there is the fiercest\ndisagreement among competent inquirers (for this point, see Loeb 1998,\n290; Tersman 2006, 133; and Schroeter and Schroeter 2013, 7\u20138).\nWouldn\u2019t such inquirers be likely to spot the indeterminacy and\nabstain from forming any (conflicting) beliefs about those issues? If\nso, then the appeal to vagueness provides just limited help to realists\nin accommodating the most likely candidates for qualifying as radical\nmoral disagreements.\n4. Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThe argument to the effect that moral disagreement generates\nproblems for moral realists by committing them to the inaccessibility\nof moral facts is ultimately of an epistemological nature. It is thus\ncongenial with the more general idea that disagreement sometimes raises\nskeptical worries by suggesting that our grounds for the contested\nbeliefs are inadequate and that they thus fail to be adequately\njustified or amount to knowledge. And although that idea applies to\nother areas as well, it is often taken to have a special relevance to\nethics, given the extent of the disagreement that occurs there.\n\n\nThe skeptical conclusions that moral disagreement has been taken to\nwarrant vary in strength, both modally and in terms of scope. The claim\nthat moral facts are inaccessible is modally strong in that it goes\nbeyond saying just that we actually lack moral knowledge or justified\nmoral beliefs. But moral disagreement has been invoked in defense of\nmodally weaker claims as well. Note that the fact that a form of\nskepticism is weak in the modal sense and just pertains to our actual\nsituation does not mean that it cannot be a part of an argument against\nmoral realism. At least, that is so as long as it is sufficiently broad\nin scope. For example, if it were shown that we are in fact unjustified\nin thinking of any moral claim that it is a truth, then that\nwould arguably diminish our justification for thinking that there are\nsuch truths in the first place (see further Tersman 2019). However, if\na skeptical conclusion is weak not only in the modal sense but also in\nthe scope sense, so that it applies only to a limited subset of our\nmoral beliefs, then it is less likely to have a role to play in a\nforceful challenge against moral realism (or other positions that seek\nto leave room for moral\n knowledge).[4]\nStill, the contention that moral disagreement has\nsuch implications is interesting in its own right.\n\n\nThe focus below is on arguments which seek to cast doubt on the\nexistence of moral knowledge, even granted that there are moral truths.\nAn alternative approach is to first argue that the disagreement\ndirectly excludes the existence of moral truths and then to simply\nderive the thesis that there is no moral knowledge from that conclusion\n(given that knowledge presupposes truth). That alternative strategy\nwill be set aside in this section. Thus, since the arguments are\nsupposed to support skeptical conclusions independently of any\nrejection of moral truths, they need to establish that our moral\nbeliefs violate some other precondition of knowledge, such as, most\ncommonly, justification.\n\n\nAny argument to that effect raises general questions about what it\ntakes for a belief to constitute knowledge or to be justified.\nNevertheless, those who put forward skeptical arguments from moral\ndisagreement do not always invoke any such general view. The reason\nmight be that they believe that the skeptical conclusions follow on\njust about any of the most promising theories that have emerged in\nepistemology, which obviously would make the arguments less vulnerable\n(see e.g., Tolhurst 1987 for this suggestion). However, others do\nexplicitly state some general view of knowledge or justification on\nwhich they rely.\n4.1 Moral Peer Disagreement\n\n\nOne example of an argument which invokes a specific view is developed\nby Sarah McGrath (2008). The view in question entails that your belief\nabout some topic does not amount to knowledge if it is \u201cdenied by\nanother person of whom it is true that: you have no more reason to\nthink that he or she is in error than you are\u201d. Armed with this\nprinciple, McGrath offers an argument to the effect that many of our\nmoral beliefs do not constitute knowledge. What she in particular has\nin mind are those beliefs that concern issues \u201cthat tend to be\nhotly contested in the applied ethics literature as well as in the\nbroader culture\u201d (92\u201393), such as the ones about the death\npenalty and meat-eating. (Derek Parfit considers a challenge which he\narticulates similarly. See 2011, 546.)\n\n\nMcGrath\u2019s principle is congenial with the position known as\n\u201cconciliationism\u201d in the peer disagreement debate, although\nthat position is more often stated in terms of justified or rational\nbelief than knowledge (see Frances 2019 for an overview of the\npositions and arguments the debate revolves around). An interlocutor is\nyour peer, roughly, if he or she is just as well equipped as you are\n(for example, in terms of evidence and reasoning skills) when it comes\nto figuring out the truth about topics of the kind the contested belief\nconcerns. According to conciliationism, if one learns that one\u2019s\nbeliefs are opposed by a peer, then one should drop the beliefs or at\nleast reduce one\u2019s confidence in them. Conciliationism thus\noffers a way to argue that moral disagreement sometimes has the type of\nsignificance assigned to it by moral skeptics (see Rowland 2020 for an\nextensive discussion of the strategy).\n\n\nConciliationism has been met with criticism from theorists who\ninstead favor \u201csteadfastness\u201d in the face of peer\ndisagreement. And the fact that conciliationism is thus a contested\ndoctrine also raises the self-defeat worry that it can be turned\nagainst itself as it may then seem to call for its own abandonment. But\nan advantage of conciliationism in the present context is that it\nallows moral skeptics to derive skeptical conclusions from moral\ndisagreement without having to assume that the parties are in ideal\ncircumstances. After all, two persons could be in equally favorable\nepistemic situations even if their situations could be improved. At the\nsame time, however, the conclusions a skeptic may, via\nconciliationism, hope to derive from such disagreements are\ncorrespondingly modest. They seem at best to entail that the parties\ncurrently lack justified beliefs or knowledge and do not rule out that\nknowledge is in principle attainable. As Richard Feldman puts it, the\nskepticism we get from conciliationism is \u201ca kind of contingent\nreal-world skepticism\u201d which does not address, for example,\n\u201cwhether it is possible for us to know about the existence and\nnature of things in the external world\u201d (2006, 217).\n\n\nThe type of skepticism which follows from conciliationism is likely\nto be limited in the scope sense as well. The reason is that, besides\nthe disputes about the death penalty, abortion, and so on, there are\nalso issues over which disagreement is rare, such as, to use a couple\nof examples which are often mentioned in this context (e.g., in Vavova\n2014), whether pain is bad and whether parents have a responsibility to\ntake care of their children. A global moral skeptic might try to\ncounter that point by noting that those claims are also opposed by some\npeople, namely error theorists such as Mackie, who reject all\n(positive) moral claims as being incorrect in one fell sweep. But even\nif that group includes some very capable thinkers, they are vastly\noutnumbered by others, including philosophers who appear no less\ncompetent. As McGrath suggests, the fact that the error theorists thus\nare outliers might in itself be seen as a reason for not regarding them\nas peers, in spite of their philosophical capabilities (2008, 95). (For\na different argument to the effect that conciliationism yields at most\na very restricted form of skepticism, see Vavova 2014.)\n4.2 Disagreement and Safety\n\n\nIs there a plausible way to accommodate the fact that there is\nnear-universal agreement about some moral claims while still\nmaintaining that moral disagreement supports global moral skepticism?\nOne option is to argue that the disagreement can play a more indirect\nrole (see, e.g., Enoch 2009). The idea could be that it is not the\ndisagreement itself which makes our moral beliefs unjustified, but\nrather some underlying factor which the disagreement is a symptom of\n(and which might obtain also when the symptom is absent). One may\nimagine, for example, that even if just some moral claims attract\ndisagreement, the best explanation of the diversity of moral views is\nnevertheless a theory about the causal background of moral beliefs\nwhich holds generally. If that theory in turn suggests that the beliefs\nare caused in a way that undermines their justification, it allows us\nto see how the disagreement can support global moral skepticism, even\ngranted that some moral claims do not generate controversy. In this\ntype of argument, the relevance of the disagreement is somewhat reduced\n(though not entirely obliterated) compared to that assigned to it by\nconciliationism, as disagreement merely plays the role of being\nevidence that the more fundamental skepticism-generating condition\nobtains.\n\n\nAccording to one suggestion along those lines, what moral\ndisagreements reveal is that the abilities or methods we use to form\nour moral beliefs are not sufficiently reliable or truth-tracking. They\nmay fail to be so, for example, by being such that, even if the beliefs\nwe have formed by using those methods are in fact true, we could easily\nhave ended up with false ones. If we could not easily have been\nmistaken (by using the same methods that we used to form our actual\nbeliefs), then our beliefs are sometimes said to be \u201csafe\u201d.\nSome theorists take safety to be a necessary condition of knowledge\n(see, e.g., Pritchard 2005 and Williamson 2000). If it could be shown\nthat existing moral disagreements indicate that our moral beliefs are\nnot safe, then this offers a way forward for moral skeptics (for this\nidea, see e.g., Mogensen 2016; Hirvela 2017; Risberg and Tersman 2019;\nand Clarke-Doane 2020, 148).\n\n\nHow is moral disagreement supposed to show that our moral beliefs\nare unsafe? Consider a person a whose beliefs about a set of\ncontested moral topics are true. The beliefs are safe only if\na, by using the same methods, could not easily have formed\nbeliefs that contradict her actual ones in circumstances where the\nmoral facts remain the same. Now, what disagreement about\na\u2019s beliefs entails is that some people have in\nfact formed beliefs that contradict a\u2019s actual ones\nin circumstances where (we are supposing) the moral facts remain the\nsame. So, if (some of) those persons have used the same methods as\na and if the existence of those persons accordingly indicates\nthat a could easily have formed those beliefs as well by using\nthose methods (on the ground, perhaps, that they have grown up in\nsimilar social or cultural circumstances and have been exposed to\nsimilar types of education), then it also indicates that\na\u2019s beliefs are unsafe.\n\n\nThis is just a sketch of an argument, of course, and it faces\nserious challenges. One is to clarify the notion of a\n\u201cmethod\u201d, which is required in order to make sense of the\nclaim that different people use the same methods to arrive at\nincompatible moral beliefs. Another problem is to explain in more\nprecise terms what it means to say that it could \u201ceasily\u201d\nhave happened that someone had formed an opposing belief. It is a\ntricky task to provide precise definitions of those notions which both\nrender the view that safety is required for knowledge plausible and\nvindicate the role assigned to disagreement by the indicated\nargument.\n4.3 Merely Possible Disagreement\n\n\nAn alternative way to try to accommodate the fact that there is\nnear-universal agreement about some moral claims, while still pursuing\na global form of moral skepticism, is to argue that the mere\npossibility of certain types of disagreement is enough to secure\nskeptical conclusions. That approach has been tried by William Tolhurst\n(1987, but see also Schiffer 2002, 288).\n\n\nTolhurst presents an argument whose conclusion is that no moral\nbeliefs are ever justified, if those beliefs are understood \u201con\nthe realist model\u201d (610). Its premises include two epistemic\nprinciples which together imply that if a person\u2019s belief that P\nis justified, then it is not possible for there to be another person\nwho is similar in all epistemically relevant respects and who believes\nnot-P. A further premise is that, for every person a and every\nmoral claim M which is accepted by a, it is indeed\npossible for there to be another person who shares a\u2019s\nnon-moral beliefs, is equally good at reasoning and is (therefore)\nsimilar in all relevant respects, and yet believes the negation of M.\nGiven that further premise, it follows that no moral belief is\njustified. As indicated, Tolhurst takes this argument to be conditional\non a realist understanding of moral beliefs. However, the premises make\nno mention of that assumption, and Tolhurst does not elaborate on how\nit would help a non-skeptic to adopt an alternative\n account.[5]\n\n\nIs the argument compelling? Tolhurst suggests that the best option\nfor those who want to resist it is to postulate \u201cthe existence of\na special ability to ascertain [\u2026] moral truth\u201d (614, see\nWright 1992, 152\u2013156, for a related suggestion). For that would allow\none to hold that there are relevant respects in which we may differ\nfrom our possible opponents, besides those concerning our non-moral\nbeliefs and (general) reasoning skills. In the ensuing discussion,\nTolhurst notes that, by postulating a special ability, realists would\n\u201cincur a significant theoretical debt\u201d (621), but he holds\nopen whether they can make good on it.\n\n\nTolhurst thus ultimately reaches the verdict that his argument is\ninconclusive, and there are additional ways to question it besides that\nwhich invokes the idea of a special cognitive ability. For example, his\ntwo principles can be challenged with reference to the\n\u201cpermissivist\u201d view that the same set of evidence can\nlicense different doxastic attitudes toward a proposition (see, e.g.,\nWhite 2005 about permissivism). However, Tolhurst also makes some\nremarks about how to move forward which are of general interest. The\nupshot of those remarks is that the argument he developed should be\nassessed from a holistic perspective. The legitimacy of invoking a\nspecifically moral cognitive ability depends, he thinks, on\n\u201cwhether a realist theory which includes [that] hypothesis can,\nas a whole, explain moral [and non-moral] phenomena more effectively\nthan its antirealist rivals\u201d (621). This is an important\nobservation in view of that arguments from moral disagreement are often\nassessed under the assumption that they are expected to establish their\nskeptical or antirealist conclusions all by themselves and are\ndismissed if it is found that they fail to do so. What the holistic\napproach suggests, however, is that, even if they fail in that sense,\nit is still conceivable that they might contribute to a successful\ncombined challenge, by joining forces with other skeptical or\nantirealist arguments, such as the evolutionary debunking ones. (The\nevolutionary debunking strategy is described and discussed in\nFitzPatrick 2021. For an attempt to combine it with arguments from\ndisagreement, see Tersman 2017, but see also Klenk 2018 for a\ncritique.)\n5. Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language\n\n\nThe previous sections address potential epistemological and\nmetaphysical implications of moral disagreement. However, it is also\nthought to be relevant to the fields of moral semantics and moral\nmetasemantics (which focus on questions about the meanings and\nfunctions of moral sentences and about the nature and contents of moral\nconvictions). Moral disagreements manifest themselves in disputes over\nsentences that involve terms such as \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d and in differences regarding when and on what basis\nthose terms are to be applied. Since such patterns of language use\nbelong to the phenomena semantical and metasemantical theories seek to\naccount for, the disagreement has been taken to have relevance also in\nthose areas.\n\n\nMuch of that discussion focuses on a certain challenge against moral\nrealism, according to which it generates implausible implications about\nwhen people are in a genuine moral disagreement. Realism is supposed to\nhave those implications because of its commitment to cognitivism and\nabsolutism, and the challenge is accordingly offered of in support of\nnon-cognitivist or relativist views. However, the implications do not\nfollow from cognitivism or absolutism alone, but only given certain\nmetasemantical assumptions about how the truth conditions of moral\nsentences and the contents of moral beliefs are determined. So, an\nimportant question is if there are plausible assumptions of that kind\nwith which realists can combine their theory to avoid the\nimplications.\n5.1 Disagreement and Charity\n\n\nAn early contribution to the debate was made by Richard Hare (1952,\nesp. 146\u2013149, but see also Stevenson 1963, and Blackburn 1984 and 1993,\nch. 11). He imagined a scenario with two facts which he assumed could\nco-exist. The first is the fact that different sets of speakers\nsystematically apply \u201cgood\u201d to different persons and\nactions and on the basis of different criteria of application with\nlittle overlap. The second is the fact that they all use \u201cgood\u201d\nas, in Hare\u2019s phrase, a \u201cgeneral adjective of\ncommendation\u201d. According to Hare, the first fact implies that\nthere is no single property which \u201cgood\u201d is used to refer\nto by all speakers in the scenario. That is, supposing that the term is\nused to refer at all, the fact suggests that it refers to different\nproperties for different speakers. This in turn means that their\ndisputes about how to apply \u201cgood\u201d need not reflect any\nconflicts of belief, as the belief that an item has one property is\ncompatible with its lacking some other property (provided that the\nproperties are appropriately distinct). Hare\u2019s point, however,\nwas that, in virtue of the second fact, it would still be plausible to\ninterpret those speakers as being in in a genuine moral dispute when\narguing about whether to apply \u201cgood\u201d or not. Hare took\nthis conclusion to suggest that moral disagreements are best seen as\nclashes of commands rather than as conflicts of belief and provided the\nargument in support of his non-cognitivist view that the\n(\u201cprimary\u201d) function of moral terms and sentences is to\nexpress such commands.\n\n\nA common realist response to the argument is to question whether the\ndifferences in language use which are assumed in Hare\u2019s scenario\nreally do rule out co-reference. Whether it does is a metasemantical\nquestion. On a metasemantical view which potentially vindicates\nHare\u2019s contention, we interpret the referential terms of a\nspeaker correctly only if we assign referents \u201ccharitably\u201d.\nAn assignment is charitable in the relevant sense if, given the\nassignment, most or many of the speaker\u2019s ascriptions of the\nterms come out true (e.g., Davidson 1973; and Lewis 1983). On that\nview, it does indeed seem hard to reconcile co-reference with a lack of\nconvergence or agreement regarding how a term of the pertinent kind is\nto be applied. However, the charity-based approach is challenged by\nother metasemantical positions, including those which take the\nreference of at least some terms to be determined in ways that allow\nfor more error. By invoking such a position, a realist could\npotentially deny Hare\u2019s conclusion that the speakers in his\nscenario use \u201cgood\u201d to refer (if at all) to different\nproperties.\n5.2 New Wave Moral Realism\n\n\nThat strategy has been pursued by Richard Boyd in defense of his\nnaturalist form of moral realism, which is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cnew wave moral realism\u201d (Boyd 1988, but see also Brink\n1989). Boyd appeals to a causal theory of reference. His version of\nthat approach is complex and differs in significant ways from more\nfamiliar versions (such as those offered in Putnam 1972 and Kripke\n1980). But the main idea is that moral terms refer to the properties\nthat \u201ccausally regulate\u201d our uses of those terms, including\nour dispositions to apply them in particular cases. Such regulation\npresupposes that there are mechanisms which causally connect\n(instantiations of) the properties with the uses. Boyd insists that\nthose mechanisms must ensure some tendency to apply the term\nreliably to actions, persons or states of affairs which have the\nproperties in question, to secure a degree of epistemic access to them.\nHowever, he also stresses that this constraint does not preclude\nserious errors. Our use of \u201cgood\u201d can be relevantly\nregulated by a certain property even if we are ignorant of it and even\nif our ignorance results in many affirmations which are false (given\nthat the term refers to the property in question). Differences in our\nuse of moral terms and sentences of the kind that Hare highlighted are\ntherefore consistent with co-reference and accordingly also with\nthinking that there is a shared (factual) subject matter over which the\npeople in his scenario express conflicting beliefs by using the\npertinent terms and sentences.\n\n\nHowever, although mere differences in application do not undermine\nco-reference on Boyd\u2019s account, other factors do. That is the\npoint of departure of a criticism which Terrence Horgan and Mark\nTimmons have developed in a series of influential papers (first set out\nin Horgan and Timmons 1991 and 1992), in which they argue that\nBoyd\u2019s causal approach also commits realists to implications of\nthe type Hare pointed to.\n\n\nThe argument is illustrated by the \u201cMoral Twin Earth\u201d\nthought experiment. Moral Twin Earth is a planet whose inhabitants\nspeak a language which is similar to ours in that it includes the moral\nterms \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\nso on. Moreover, the social and psychological roles those terms play in\ntheir communities overlap with those they play in our communities. We\nmay imagine, for example, that they figure in similar ways in their\ndeliberations and discussions about how to act, and that the\ninhabitants are, like us, in general motivated to act and avoid acting\nin ways they classify as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d,\nrespectively. A further stipulation\u2014a crucial one in this\ncontext\u2014is that the inhabitants\u2019 uses of the pertinent\nterms are causally regulated by different properties than those that\nregulate our uses of them. Thus, their use of \u201cright\u201d is\nregulated by the property actions have by satisfying certain\ndeontological requirements, while ours is regulated by the\nconsequentialist property actions have when maximizing happiness. Given\nthat stipulation, \u201cright\u201d does not, on Boyd\u2019s\naccount, refer to the same property for us and for them. So, again, the\ndisputes we might have with them about how to apply \u201cright\u201d\nneed not reflect any conflicts of belief. What Horgan and Timmons\nsuggest, however, in a way which mirrors Hare\u2019s argumentation, is\nthat it would still be plausible to construe our disputes with them\nregarding how to apply it as genuine moral disagreements, in virtue of\nthe overlap in social and psychological roles (for a different critique\nof Boyd\u2019s approach, see Schroeter and Schroeter 2013).\n5.3 Further Developments and Responses\n\n\nThe Moral Twin Earth thought experiment has led philosophers to\nexplore other metasemantical options, besides Boyd\u2019s causal\ntheory, which realists may use to argue that they can accommodate the\npertinent intuitions about when people are in a genuine moral\ndisagreement. These options include conceptual role semantics (Wedgwood\n2001) and David Lewis\u2019 views on \u201creference magnetism\u201d\n(van Roojen 2006; Dunaway and McPherson 2016; Williams 2016; see Eklund\n2017 for further discussion). The general problem that those\nalternative suggestions are intended to solve can be indicated as\nfollows. Horgan\u2019s and Timmons\u2019 argument suggests that the\nfact that a speaker\u2019s use of \u201cright\u201d is regulated by\na certain property is of limited relevance to the plausibility of\nviewing us as being in a genuine disagreement when discussing its\napplication. What matters are instead the considerations pertaining to\nthe social and psychological roles the term plays in the\nspeaker\u2019s community and in his or her deliberations. To\naccommodate the intuitions the moral twin earth thought experiment\nevokes (and to handle new scenarios that antirealists might come up\nwith), what realists seem to need is thus an account to the effect that\nthose very considerations are enough to secure co-reference. That is,\nthe account must entail that the features that tempt us to interpret\nthe speaker as being in a genuine moral disagreement with us are the\nsame as, or at least reliably correlated with, the features on which\nco-reference is taken to supervene.\n\n\nThe difficulties of developing an account which fits that bill are\nelevated by the fact that there are further requirements it arguably\nmust meet. One such additional requirement is that the account must be\nplausibly applicable also to other domains besides morality (see\nSchroeter and Schroeter 2013 and Dunaway and McPherson 2016 for\ndiscussions of the relevant constraints). To design an account of\nreference which entails that there is co-reference in exactly the cases\nwhere we intuitively think that people disagree in scenarios such as\nthe Moral Twin Earth one may not be such a difficult task. But the idea\nbehind the additional requirement is that this would be ad hoc\nif the account were only applicable to moral terms (or to normative\nterms in general). Note in this context that Boyd takes his account to\napply not only to moral terms but to natural kind terms quite generally\n(which is the type he thinks that \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d are instances of), including \u201cwater\u201d\nand \u201cgold\u201d. If one were to drop that \u201cgenerality\nconstraint\u201d, allowing for a metasemantic view that applies just\nto moral or other normative terms, then the task for the realist would\nbe simpler.\n\n\nIs there a way to justify such a move? In this connection, one might\nwonder if it would help the moral realist to be a non-naturalist about\nthe nature of moral properties, i.e., to hold that they are not\nreducible to natural properties and (on some characterizations of the\ntheory) to assume that they are sui generis and causally\ninert. That is an issue which has not been in the foreground in the\ndebate following the Horgan\u2019s and Timmons\u2019 contributions,\nas they specifically target Boyd\u2019s (and Brink\u2019s) naturalist\nform of realism.\n\n\nWhether non-naturalism really is less vulnerable to the challenge is\nnot clear, however. On the one hand, the assumption that moral\nproperties are sui generis may help realists to defend the\nexceptionalist view that the reference of moral terms is determined in\na special way (at least along with terms in other domains that deal\nwith non-natural properties). On the other hand, explaining how our\nmoral terms have come to refer to such properties may be extra\ndifficult, especially given the further assumption that they are\ncausally inert (the issue is discussed in Suikkanen 2017). It should\nalso be noted that the soundness of at least the charity-based versions\nof the challenge seems unaffected by what view one takes on the nature\nof moral properties. On those versions, systematic differences\nregarding the application of moral terms threaten to undermine\nco-reference regardless of whether the candidate properties to which\nthose terms refer are taken to be non-natural or not.\n\n\nThe responses that so far have been discussed are aimed to show that\nrealists are not in fact committed to the allegedly implausible\nimplications (viz., that certain moral disputes are merely apparent) to\nwhich antirealists seek to tie them. Another type of response is to\nbite the bullet, to insist that the pertinent implications are after\nall acceptable, and to explain away their counter-intuitiveness in a\nway which is consistent with realism.\n\n\nOn one such suggestion, the parties of some disputes about how to\napply \u201cright\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d do indeed use the terms\nto refer to different properties. But what they really disagree about\nis which property the terms should be used to refer to, in\nsome non-moral sense of \u201cshould\u201d (see, e.g., Merli 2002 and\nPlunkett and Sundell 2013). Presumably, however, this suggestion helps\nthe realist only if that other, background dispute can in turn be\nconstrued as a conflict of belief. So, if the challenge could be\nextended to cover the \u201cshould\u201d which is relevant in that\ncontext as well, which it seems hard to rule out, nothing much is\naccomplished (see Tersman 2006, 100 and Dunaway and McPherson 2016,\n661, for this point).\n\n\nA different option is to concede that the appearance in the relevant\ncases of a genuine dispute is best explained in terms of clashes of\nconative attitudes, and to stress that this explanation is not\nincompatible with realism. After all, realists can consistently agree\nthat moral convictions are usually accompanied with such attitudes (see\nJackson and Pettit 1998 for this point). By making that response,\nrealists in effect give up trying to account for the cases by using\nassumptions that form a part of their theory. For even if the\nassumption that the cases involve clashing attitudes is not\ninconsistent with realism it is also not entailed by it. A potential\nproblem with that type of response is raised by the natural view that\nthe justification of a theory about moral semantics (such as the form\nof cognitivism which forms a component of realism) depends at least in\npart on its ability to explain how people behave or relate to disputes\nabout how to apply moral terms. The relevant facts include the\nwillingness of such disputants to see themselves as standing in genuine\nopposition to each other. Thus, if, in some cases, that fact is best\nexplained by assumptions that are external to that theory, then some\nbits of the relevant evidence fail to support it. That is a potential\ndisadvantage of the pertinent response, although there may obviously be\nother sets of evidence which make up for the (alleged) loss (see\nfurther Tersman 2006, ch. 5 and Bj\u00f6rnsson 2012).\n6. Over-Generalization and Self-Defeat Worries\n\n\nWidespread disagreement occurs not only in ethics but in just about\nany domain, including the sciences. A longstanding worry about\nskeptical or antirealist arguments from moral disagreement has\ntherefore been that they generate analogous conclusions about those\nother domains as well (e.g., Brink 1989 and Huemer 2005). More\nrecently, the debate has come to focus not only on the empirical\nsciences but also on areas such as mathematics (Clarke-Doane 2020) and\nother philosophical areas besides ethics, including epistemology,\nmetaphysics and metaethics itself (e.g., Shafer-Landau 2006; Cuneo\n2007).\n\n\nAccording to the idea which underlies the concern, the skeptical or\nantirealist arguments from disagreement that apply to ethics and the\nversions that apply to the other domains are equally compelling. The\nsuggestion that this kind of parity obtains is in turn offered as an\nobjection to the arguments, as it is supposed to show that they\n\u201cover-generalize\u201d and lead to \u201ctoo much\u201d\nskepticism or antirealism. Why too much? That is, why cannot those who\nfavor the arguments just embrace their alleged wider implications as\nyet being, though perhaps surprising and unintended, perfectly\nacceptable? Two answers to that question can be discerned. (The\ndistinction between the answers is noted in Tersman 2010 and in\nP\u00f6ltzler 2020.)\n\n\nOn the first answer, the parity undermines the skeptical or\nantirealist arguments because there are independent reasons for\nrejecting the conclusions they yield when applied to the other areas\n(it is assumed here that those reasons do not in turn undermine the\nparity claim). This would arguably cast doubts on the arguments. For if\nthey yield incorrect conclusions in those contexts, why think that they\ndo a better job in the case of ethics? In other words, the idea is that\nthe parity provides resources for a reductio ad\nabsurdum of sorts of the arguments.\n\n\nWhich are the independent reasons that may back up such a challenge?\nOne option is to appeal to the sheer counter-intuitiveness of the wider\nimplications. Thus, Shafer-Landau writes:\n\n\nIf intractable disagreement [\u2026] is enough to warrant an\nantirealist diagnosis of an area, then the whole of philosophy must be\ndemoted. That simply is implausible: there really is (or isn\u2019t)\nsuch a thing as probabilistic causation, numbers without\nspatio-temporal location, actions that are both free and determined,\netc. (2006, 220).\n\n\nOthers raise more specific objections of this kind. For example,\nFrank Jackson (1999) targets arguments for moral non-cognitivism and\nclaims that they, when appropriately adjusted, provide equal support\nfor non-cognitivism about theoretical rationality (i.e., judgments\nabout when beliefs are rational). The latter view is in turn criticized\non the ground that it commits one, via certain (contestable)\nassumptions about the nature of beliefs, to think \u201cthat there are\nno believers and no beliefs\u201d (423). The absurdity of that\nimplication is taken by Jackson to refute non-cognitivism about\ntheoretical rationality. But he also takes it to undermine the\narguments that are used in its support, and therefore also the versions\nof those arguments which apply to ethics (even if no similarly absurd\nimplication can be directly derived from moral non-cognitivism).\n\n\nHow can advocates of arguments from moral disagreement respond to\nsuch challenges? The prospects depend partly on which other domain(s)\nethics is compared with. A connection of the pertinent sort with some\ndomains may result in less pressing problems than a connection with\nothers. For example, the jury is arguably still out regarding\nantirealism about mathematics, as such positions do have able defenders\n(e.g., Field 1989). So, if an overgeneralization challenge depends on\nthe implausibility of those positions, there is some room for advocates\nof the arguments to resist the objection.\n\n\nThe second answer to why the alleged parity between ethics and other\ndomains undermines arguments from disagreement may generate a more\ndecisive objection, however. On that answer, the parity makes the\narguments self-defeating and the position of their advocates\nincoherent.\n\n\nThat type of challenge can in turn take different forms. A\nstraightforward way to argue that an argument is self-defeating is to\nshow that its advocates are committed to claims that are outright\ninconsistent with it (i.e., either with its conclusion or with its\npremises). Consider for example an argument which is aimed at\nestablishing the error-theoretical thesis that all moral claims are\nfalse. If that argument can be extended to metaethics, so that it\ncommits its advocates to thinking that all metaethical claims are false\nas well (including the error theory), then they have obviously ended up\nin an awkward place.\n\n\nAnother type of self-defeat or incoherence is epistemic, as\ncontrasted with the \u201cstrict\u201d type just indicated. An\nargument is epistemically self-defeating, we may say, if we by\naffirming it commit ourselves to thinking that at least one of its\nelements is unjustified (rather than false). That is the type of\nincoherence that Derek Parfit has tried to saddle moral\nnon-cognitivists with by stressing (like Jackson) that they are\ncommitted to non-cognitivism about theoretical rationality as well.\nParfit takes the latter view to imply that \u201cto call a thing\nrational is not to state a matter of fact\u201d (2011, 409). And the\nproblem for the moral non-cognitivist which he discerns is that\n\u201c[i]f there could not be truths about what it is rational to\nbelieve [\u2026] it could not be rational to believe anything\u201d,\nincluding moral non-cognitivism.\n\n\nParfit makes a problematic move by deriving the normative claim that\nit is not rational to believe in non-cognitivism from a metanormative\nthesis about what it is to state such a claim. But it is easy enough to\ncome up with other examples of epistemic self-defeat. Thus, consider an\nargument aimed at establishing global moral skepticism. Any such\nargument must invoke some epistemological principle via which\nthe skeptical conclusion can be derived. So, if the argument applies\njust as well (mutatis mutandis) to epistemology and shows that\nwe lack justified beliefs in that area as well, then it commits its\nadvocates to thinking that one of its premises is not justified. This\ntype of incoherence is presumably less worrying than the first one, as\nit neither rules out the validity of the argument nor the truth of its\npremises. But it is clearly sufficiently worrying to raise concerns\nabout the target argument\u2019s dialectical significance (see Sampson\n2019 for discussion).\n\n\nThe above discussion illustrates that an argument\u2019s\nvulnerability to an overgeneralization challenge depends on which other\ndomain(s) the challenge focuses on, as well as on the conclusion of the\nargument (whether it pursues a local or global form of moral\nskepticism, for example). However, it also depends on how the\nargument reaches its conclusion and on which further premises it\ninvolves besides the one that postulates disagreement.\n\n\nThe last point is important. The most straightforward way to respond\nto an overgeneralization objection is to insist that there are after\nall crucial differences between the disagreement that occurs in ethics\nand that which occur in the other areas. This is what Mackie did by\nsuggesting that scientific disagreements, unlike moral ones, result\nfrom speculative inferences or inadequate evidence. Whether the\ndisagreements are different in such ways is an empirical issue which is\nhard to resolve. However, the fact that any argument from moral\ndisagreement involves further premises besides that which posits\ndisagreement leaves their advocates with other options when trying to\nchallenge the relevant parity claim. That is, it potentially allows\nthem to concede that there is \u201cjust as much\u201d or \u201cjust\nas deep\u201d disagreement in ethics and the other areas and still\nconsistently argue that the disagreement that occurs in those areas\nlicense different conclusions about their status.\n\n\nTake for example the semantical arguments which were considered in\nthe previous section. They rely on the idea that it is\ncounter-intuitive to construe certain disputes over the application of\nmoral terms as being merely apparent. In analogous disputes in\nepistemology, such as those between internalists and externalists about\nwhen to classify beliefs as \u201cjustified\u201d, such a diagnosis\nmay be more acceptable. At least, that is the upshot of a suggestion by\nWilliam Alston, who indicates that it helps explain the lack of\nconvergence in epistemology (see Alston 2005a, esp. ch. 1; Alston\n2005b, 137; and Tersman 2010).\n\n\nAdditional options are generated by the above-mentioned idea that\nalthough appeals to moral disagreement are not capable of establishing\nany skeptical or antirealist conclusions on their own, they may do so\nwhen combined with other strategies, such as the evolutionary debunking\nones. Such a combined strategy might be more promising in the moral\ncase than, say, in the epistemological case. A crucial assumption in\nevolutionary debunking arguments is that an evolutionary explanation of\nour moral convictions does not support their reliability (although it\nmay be consistent with it). Whether that is so in the case of our\nepistemic convictions is a separate issue and may call for a different\nanswer, which potentially leaves room for a different assessment of a\ncombined argument which is applied in that context (see further Tersman\n2010).\n\n\nThe availability of these ways to respond to overgeneralization\nobjections adds to the difficulties of reaching a conclusive assessment\nof them and thus also to the difficulty of assessing the arguments that\nprovide their target themselves. It thereby confirms a more general\nobservation, namely, that while each of the skeptical or antirealist\narguments surveyed above involves problematic elements, quick and\nimpatient dismissals of appeals to moral disagreement are often\nsimilarly dubious. That may be frustrating but is also unsurprising.\nThe discussion about the metaethical significance of moral disagreement\nraises intricate and philosophically central issues about knowledge,\njustification, how reference is determined, and so on. This helps to\nexplain why progress is slower than one might desire but also why the\nphenomenon commands continued attention from philosophers.\n",
