    "main_text": "Language, Law, and Sexual Difference\n3. Language, Law, and Sexual Difference \n\nIn considering the background of psychoanalytic feminism, a large\nportion of which is rooted in or aligned with what gets called French\nFeminism, the French context of psychoanalytic theory is also crucial,\nand in particular the work of Jacques Lacan. Lacan\u2019s work has\nbeen both a powerful influence on, and an object of critique for,\nfeminist appropriations of psychoanalysis, and his ideas have been\ntaken up, transformed, and challenged by Luce Irigaray and Julia\nKristeva (both of whom are discussed below), among others.\nLacan\u2019s work is both praised for its de-biologization of Freud\nand pilloried for its phallocentrism. These two aspects are in fact\nimbricated, as both hinge on Lacan\u2019s elaboration of language as\na symbolic order that precedes and makes possible human subjectivity.\nIn order to stay focused on the feminist deployment of the\npsychoanalytic theoretical apparatus, I will concentrate first on\nLacan\u2019s understanding of the intersection of language and law in\nthe symbolic order, and then on his account of the ego\u2019s\nformation in the imaginary order. The imaginary and symbolic are modes\nof representation that make the world and the self intelligible. The\nsymbolic is Lacan\u2019s term for the way in which reality becomes\nintelligible and takes on meaning and significance, through words; the\nimaginary refers to the mode of intelligibility offered by images. The\nconcordant and conflicting mediation of the world by images and words\ncoordinates, or makes sense of, reality and instigates both\nsubjectivity and social relations. As with Freud, maternal and\npaternal figures are central to his account of subjectivity. \n\nLacan characterizes his own work as fundamentally a return to Freud,\nalbeit one that brings the insights of structural linguistics,\nespecially Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson, and structural\nanthropology, primarily Claude Levi-Strauss, into the domain of\npsychoanalysis. Even so, his returns are also revisions; he not only\nretrieves but renovates Freud\u2019s central concepts.\nAccording to Lacan, Freud\u2019s theory of sexuality anticipates a\ntheory of signification that he could not yet elaborate. The\nanthropological and linguistic lineage of Lacan\u2019s thought is\ncentral to this conceptualization of a \u201csymbolic universe\ndomain.\u201d Lacan explicitly endorses Levi-Strauss\u2019s\nconception of the transcendental law at the origin of human sociality\nas the incest taboo; he writes that \u201cthe fundamental or primary\nlaw, the one where culture begins in opposition to nature, is the law\nof the prohibition of incest\u201d (Lacan 1986 [1992: 66\u20137]).\nThe intrusion of language and law institutes a break with nature, one\nthat transfigures the world by imbuing it with meaning. Following the\nlogic of Totem and Taboo, social identities are constituted\non the basis of exclusions that establish kinship networks. These\nsocial bonds are maintained through mandates and prohibitions (what is\nrequired and what is forbidden), and in particular through the mandate\nof exogamy (with its structures of exchange) which determines that\n\u201cthe Oedipus complex is both universal and contingent\u201d\n(Lacan 1978 [1991b: 33]): paternal prohibition provides the conditions\nfor human sociality without the prohibition itself being innate. Lacan\nthus accounts for the transgenerational transmission of elementary\nstructures of kinship without appealing to any natural necessity.\nLacan takes this law of kinship (dictating desire and its limits) to\nbe fundamentally co-terminous with the order of language since it is\ninstituted through a symbolic articulation.\n\nLacan calls the paternal prohibition (the incest taboo) the \u2018law\nof the father,\u2019 and he develops the connection between law and\nlanguage by way of a pun. In French Non (No) and Nom\n(Name) sound alike. The no that prohibits (the father\u2019s law) and\nthe name that establishes authority (the father\u2019s name or the\nproper name) are conferred simultaneously. By submitting to the law of\nthe father (his no and name) the child assumes a symbolic identity and\nplace in the human universe of meaning, i.e., the child becomes a\nsubject, bound by law and bearer of language. With this compliance,\nthe child takes on a life of desire and incompletion, pursuing lost\nobjects with no firm ground or fixed purpose, a lack of plenitude in\nbeing that Lacan designates as castration. \n\nAs discussed above in the section on Freud, Freud understands women to\nbe \u2018castrated,\u2019 deprived of a penis, and men to live under\nthe threat of castration. Lacan complicates this theoretical\nperspective by deeming all subjects, all speaking beings, to be\ncastrated, by which he means deprived of the phallus, which is not the\nsame as the penis. While the penis is a biological organ, the phallus\nis a signifier which invokes or points toward other signifiers, or\ntoward a system of signifiers.  The moment of\ncastration is the primordial moment of loss, the fracturing of being\nby language. With entry into the reign of law and language, subjects\nare cut off from the immediacy of bodily experience; relations to\nthings, and to oneself and others, are now mediated by words and\nrepresentations. \n\nCastration takes place when the child recognizes lack in the mother\nand her maternal omnipotence is annulled. The mother, for the child,\nceases to be the all-powerful provider of every satisfaction as she\nherself is a desiring being deprived of satisfaction. This conundrum\nof maternal desire points elsewhere, toward \u201cthe law introduced\nby the father\u201d (Lacan 1966 [2006: 582]). The paternal\nprohibition intervenes to warn the child that s/he is not the answer\nto the question of the mother\u2019s desire. Galvanized by the\nmother\u2019s lack, the law of the father (which need not be embodied\nin an actual person) takes the place of the desire of the mother,\nsubstitutes for it, occludes it. Indeed the paternal function, working\nthrough name and law, indicates a dead father, just as Freud\nunderstands in Totem and Taboo that the murdered father, the\nprecondition of law, is stronger than the living one. In the Lacanian\nversion of the Oedipal Complex, human beings achieve a sexual position\nby traversing the Oedipal Complex, i.e., by submitting to castration,\nalso called the phallic function, and thereby entering into\nsignification. There is thus no sexual difference prior to\nrepresentation.\n\nHere we arrive at the phallocentrism, if not the patriarchalism, of\nLacan\u2019s thought, the central role of the phallus in his thinking\nabout subjectivity and sexual difference. According to Lacan, the\nphallus instates the signifier into the subject regardless of any\n\u201canatomical distinction between the sexes\u201d (Lacan 1966\n[2006: 576]). The phallus, in other words, is responsible for the\nchild\u2019s passage from immersion in perceptual immediacy to a\nrepresentational domain in which the world takes on meaning. It is\nthis claim that de-biologizes Freud, since it articulates the function\nof the phallus apart from any particular bodily attributes. Lacan\ninsists that the phallus is a signifier, not an image or bodily organ,\nand that in relation to it all are castrated. The father\u2019s No\neffectively says to the child \u2018you are not the object of the\nmother\u2019s desire\u2019 or \u2018you are not her phallus, the\nthing that fulfills her.\u2019 As such, it also conveys the message\nthat the child too is lacking or desiring. Although Lacan\ndistinguishes between a \u2018seeming to be\u2019 which\ncharacterizes femininity, in the attempt to be the phallus that one is\nnot (to be the object of desire), from a \u2018seeming to have\u2019\nwhich characterizes masculinity in the attempt to have the phallus\nthat one does not have (to possess the object of desire), he still\nmaintains that everyone is lacking the phallus in some way, either in\nthe mode of not being it or in the mode of not having it. Nonetheless,\nwhile Lacan centers human experience not on the supposed biological\nfixity of anatomical distinctions, but on a representational economy,\nthe phallus retains its associations with masculinity and remains the\nfocal point of sexual identity. \n\nAs already discussed, Freud had theorized that there is only one\nlibido and it is masculine. In \u201cThe Signification of the\nPhallus,\u201d Lacan explicitly addresses, and criticizes, the\nalternative view that there might be two libidos, which he satirizes\nas a kind of sexual equality, the \u201cequality of natural\nrights\u201d (Lacan 1966 [2006: 577]). This is the view I earlier\nmentioned as belonging to Karen Horney who defends the idea of an\ninherent, underived, biologically-based, nature of feminine sexuality.\nLacan also disparages the idea that the final stage of genital\nsexuality is directed toward the entire person in his or her\npersonhood, the achievement of a kind of tenderness toward the whole\nbeing of another (Lacan 1966 [2006: 580]). Lacan disputes both of\nthese positions as normalizing and biologizing and claims that the\npsyche is not harmonized with nature in either of these ways. In\ncontrast to this fantasy of sexual complementarity, the idea that\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s sexual interests converge, Freud, Lacan\nclaims, understood \u201cthe essential disturbance of human\nsexuality\u201d (1966 [2006: 575]), that we are always lacking,\nalways in search of aims and objects, \u201cthe deviation of\nman\u2019s needs due to the fact that he speaks\u201d (1966 [2006:\n579]), and that this discordance means also that there is no\nsymmetrical or harmonious sexual relation between well-integrated and\nself-realized men and women.\n\nThis symbolic dimension of human relations must be clearly\ndistinguished from the imaginary as the domain of the ego. The\nimaginary order is most fundamentally and plainly elucidated in\nLacan\u2019s essay \u201cThe Mirror Stage as Formative of the\nI Function as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience,\u201d\nwhere he elaborates Freud\u2019s insights in The Ego and the\nId, taking up the idea that the ego is first and foremost a\nbodily ego formed through the \u201cprojection of a surface\u201d\n(Freud 1923 [1968: 27]), a visual representation of an external veneer\nor fa\u00e7ade. Lacan concurs, writing that consciousness occurs\n\u201ceach time \u2026 there\u2019s a surface such that it can\nproduce what is called an image\u201d (Lacan 1978 [1991b:\n49]). The mirror stage commences, pre-Oedipally, when the infant is\naround 6 months old. The infant at this age is literally\ninfans, without speech and moreover, without bodily\ncoordination or motor control. Born prematurely, at a point prior to\nany adequate capacity for self-care, the infant is wholly\ninstinctually inept. By identifying itself with an image, a coherent\nunity that contrasts to its own fragmented and dispersed bodily\nexistence, the infant forms a preliminary self, one animated by an\nillusion but an illusion that allows it to anticipate its own future\norganization.\n\nLacan\u2019s account of the mirror stage establishes the ego as\nfundamentally imaginary, formed through the infant\u2019s specular\ncaptivation with the unitary form presented in images of itself which\nit assumes as its own through identification. This perceptual image of\ncoherent bodily contours and boundaries is at odds with the\ninfant\u2019s motor incapacity and the \u201cturbulent\nmovements\u201d or fragmented drives that animate its own body and\nprocesses. The ego, with its illusion of self-mastery and containment,\nis formed through misrecognition, an anticipatory identification with\nan idealized, stable, self-enclosed, citadel of self. This\nidentification with an image of oneself sets up the ego as rivalrous,\nnarcissistic, and aggressive. While the act of misrecognition becomes\nthe basis for a sense of self or for self-consciousness, it is also an\nact of alienation, exclusion, or self-division; by erecting an\nimaginary ideal, representing oneself in a perfected image, the self\nis also split and rendered unconscious to itself, cut off from the\nmultiplicity of dispersed drives. \n\nFor Lacan, the ego is a \u201cknot of imaginary servitude\u201d\n(Lacan 1966 [2006: 80]) and thus the site of the subject\u2019s\nstagnancy and inertia. The mirror stage also forms the basis of\nLacan\u2019s critique of ego psychology; whereas the latter takes\nstrengthening the ego to be the aim of analytic practice, Lacan takes\nthe aspirations of the ego to be a \u201clure\u201d (1966 [2006:\n78]) of self-possession, an armor that rigidifies the subject and\nresists freedom and movement, a defensive structure that provides an\nalienating identity. With this theory of the ego, Lacan presents a\nsubject at odds with itself, non-self-identical, in \u201cprimordial\nDiscord\u201d (1966 [2006: 78]), torn between unity and anarchy,\norganization and chaos, integration and fragmentation. The withdrawal\nof the self from itself proceeds from the reflexivity of\nrepresentational practices of language. The ego as object is trapped\nin oppositional relationships, including with itself, and cannot\ntherefore be equated with the subject as speaking being who, in the\nuse of words, signifiers that are differentially related to one\nanother, is capable of more complex plays of presence and absence;\nlanguage, unlike perception (I perceive an object or I don\u2019t),\ncan evoke simultaneously the presence and the absence of the thing (I\ncan represent objects that are not present).\n\nWhile the advent of the symbolic order is tied to Oedipalization, and\nthe imaginary order is tied to the pre-Oedipal period, it would be\nmistaken to think of the imaginary and symbolic in only developmental\nor chronological terms as they are also ongoing structures of\nexperience. Even in the seemingly dyadic relation between mother and\nchild, Lacan argues, a third term is always at work. Initially this\nthird term is simply a question, the question of the mother\u2019s\ndesire, of what she wants, but already this question interrupts or\ndestabilizes the child\u2019s position, rents dyadic unity, even as\nthe child takes itself to be this object of desire, since it indicates\nin a preliminary way that the mother is lacking, that she is not\nwhole, entire, omnipotent. The question of desire, in other words,\nmeans that the phallic mother of the imaginary is already the\ncastrated mother of the symbolic, and that the imaginary unity of the\nego, with its oppositional relations, is bound to be sublated into a\nsymbolic relation of difference.\n\nIt is important, however, not to conflate the mother with the woman or\nmaternity with femininity. Lacan famously declares that\n\u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as Woman, Woman with a capital\nW indicating the universal\u201d (1975 [1998: 72]), a\nmetaphysical concept with determinate and substantive content. In\nasserting that \u2018The Woman\u2019 does not exist, Lacan indicates\nthat something of the psyche escapes castration, limitation,\nsignification, and the demands of the law of the father. Symbolic and\nimaginary representations leave something out, hit their limit,\nproduce an impasse that presents a fracture or fissure in the symbolic\norder. While sexual difference is mediated by representation, it\ncannot be fully contained within its terms.\n\n\nThe idea that sexual difference is not biologically innate but\nestablished through language and law has led some feminists to conclude\nthat Lacan is on the side of social constructionism but this would be\nmistaken. Lacan is adamant that the choice between nature and\nculture is a false one, and that language is not a \u201csocial\nphenomenon\u201d (Lacan 2006 [1970], 578). Language and law,\npersonified by the name of the father, are irreducible to social\npractices and processes and are in fact the condition of their\npossibility. While Lacan is criticized for constituting sexual\ndifference on the basis of the phallic function and subjectivity on the\nbasis of paternal authority, what the Lacanian project does provide for\nfeminism is not the idea of a malleable culture, susceptible to human\nmastery, as distinct from a fixed nature that escapes it, but the more\ndisconcerting idea that human mastery, of ourselves, of others, of\nnature and culture, is itself illusory. Rather than the promise\nof a rational progress toward greater and greater equality, respect for\nindividual difference, and universality, Lacan's insights, like\nFreud's, point toward the precariousness of identity and social\nbonds and to the instability of the drives that attach us to one\nanother. Subjectivity and sexuality are not natural adaptations\nbut deviations, detours, breaks from nature that undermine identity and\ndivide or limit any unity of self or community. In addition to\nthe distinctiveness of his method, focus, and insight, this willingness\nto grapple with the limits of self-mastery is one reason why Lacan has been taken\nas an innovative and amenable resource for some feminist theorists.\nIn exposing the inadequacies of social or empirical accounts of\nsexual difference, identity, and the power relations built upon them,\nLacan confronts the fundamental structures at the root of empirical\nsocio-historical circumstances.\n",
