Other Routes to Libertarianism\n\nAs noted above, there are a variety of moral foundations that\nlibertarians draw upon for their central normative claims. Whilst most\nlibertarians will articulate the structure of libertarianism in terms\nof rights, by no means do all libertarians believe rights to be\nfoundational in a deontological sense, let alone that the most\nvaluable articulation of them is in the form of universal\nself-ownership. In this section we will briefly discuss other moral\nand conceptual inputs that yield roughly libertarian outputs in\npolitical philosophy.\n\nSome libertarians ground their political philosophy in\nneo-Aristotelian eudaimonism. On this view, the moral life is\nfundamentally understood the flourishing of the individual in terms of\nfulfilling or perfecting their nature or telos, achieving a state of\neudaimonia. The unique way in which we each flourish requires\na community to flourish within and as a part of, but it also must be,\nat bottom, a self-directed process due to its uniqueness. Therefore,\nit is an ethical imperative to both live within a society, and to have\none\u2019s potential for individual practical reasoning protected.\nDouglas Rasmussen and Douglass Den Uyl (1991, 2005, 2016, 2020) argue\nthat individual rights to negative liberty render each person\u2019s\nflourishing compossible with others\u2019. These rights allow\nindividuals to participate in the community (or a variety of\ncommunities) as they deem fit in light of their practical reason, but\ndoes not allow anyone to pursue flourishing in a way that morally\ncannibalizes the flourishing of others. Rasmussen and Den Uyl argue\nthat rights, on this view, are metanormative principles that are\nnecessary for ordinary normativity to operate within a social context.\nLibertarian justice then is a sort of meta-virtue that enables a\ndiversity of other forms of virtue. Some argue that this approach must\nconverge with a certain kind of deontological approach (Christmas\n2018a), but Rasmussen and Den Uyl resist this (2018). Indeed, there is\na broader tradition of grounding natural rights in Aristotelian ethics\nwithin natural law theory, going back to St. Thomas Aquinas (1947,\nalso see Finnis 2011).\n\nOther libertarians deploy a contractualist or contractarian framework\nof moral reasoning in order to arrive at libertarian conclusions. For\nexample, Loren Lomasky argues from an egoistic rational choice\nframework that it is rational for individuals to adopt a framework of\nindividual, negative rights (2016, 1987, also see Narveson 2011).\nWhilst Gerald Gaus deploys the public reason framework to argue for a\nstate that is constitutionally constrained along libertarian lines\n(2009, 2010, 2012). What these views share is that whilst libertarian\nrights may be the most just ideal of rights, they must be discovered\nor constructed through a rational and social process, rather than\nderived logically from human nature or abstract reason.\n\nRule-consequentialist libertarians argue that social welfare is\noptimized by society adopting libertarian rules. Richard Epstein\nargues that legal rules that protect individual rights against one\nanother and against the state generate higher amounts of social\nwelfare than legal rules that permit significant amounts of\nexpropriation and coercion (Epstein, 1995, 1998, 2015, also see\nBarnett 1998b). On this view rights are justified to the extent that\nthey serve this welfare-enhancing role over time as part of a legal\nsystem, but have little or no intrinsic value in and of themselves.\nThis view therefore permits state-takings of private property where it\nis conducive to the general welfare (Epstein 1985). The methodology of\nlaw and economics is central to this school of thought. It\nseeks to use empirical research to investigate the economic efficiency\nof different legal arrangements. Ronald Coase\u2019s paper \u201cThe\nProblem of Social Cost\u201d (1960) is typically seen as the\ninaugural work in this vein.\n\nOther libertarians are more implicitly rule-consequentialist and\ndeploy economic arguments for the kinds of political and legal\narrangements libertarians favour \u2013 specifically, epistemic\narguments (Friedman 1997, Pennington 2011, Tebble 2016). They will\noften argue that institutions of private property and freedom of\ncontract, enforced by a constitutionally constrained state, are the\nbest way of ensuring social knowledge is deployed in pro-social ways,\nand will point to constraints on how far this knowledge can be\ncentralized by even a presumptively benevolent central planner. These\narguments are drawn explicitly from Hayek (cf. Boettke 2018) and the\nAustrian School of economic thought more broadly (see especially Mises\n1935, Hayek 1945, Kirzner 1997).\n\nA subtle approach that does not easily fit into the categories above\nfollows the work of Adam Smith, claiming that libertarian ideas are\ninherent in our ordinary moral psychology and how it interacts with\ncommercial society (cf. Otteson 2012, Schmidtz 2016, Cowen &\nGeloso 2021, Cowen 2021). Smith famously considered justice to be\nstrictly negative in nature \u2013 something we satisfy simply\nthrough abstaining from theft, coercion, and other violations of\nlibertarian rights. Thus, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\nSmith wrote that the rules that \u201ccall loudest for vengeance and\npunishment are the laws which guard the life and person of our\nneighbour; the next are those which guard his property and\npossessions; and last of all come those which guard what are called\nhis personal rights, or what is due to him from the promises of\nothers.\u201d (Smith 1976 [1759], p. 84) These are the only acts that\nare generally disapproved of in a way calling for punishment. (1976\n[1759], p. 78) Rule-following of this kind is desirable because\nit\u2019s conducive to the stability and effectiveness of society.\n(1976 [1759], p. 86) None of this means that people do not have\nobligations to assist others. Smith grounds his view in a deeply\nsocial view of moral psychology. Thus, benevolence along with justice\nis a pillar of society. However, we cannot expect or force people to\ncare for distant strangers in the same way as they care for\nthemselves. And trying to organize a society along these lines would\nlead to disaster. Smith was extremely skeptical about government\nofficials, writing about how they seek fame and power, think\nthemselves morally superior, and are more than willing to serve their\nown interests and those of well-connected businessmen rather than the\npublic good. (Smith 1976 [1776], pp. 266\u20137). And, perhaps\nforeshadowing Hayek, Smith argued that governments are generally\nincapable of knowing enough to guide large numbers of people. Human\nbeings make their own decisions and respond to circumstances, thus\nthwarting any systematic plans the government might lay out for them.\nThus, as a rule, it is more promising to appeal to people\u2019s\nself-interest through market exchange than to use state coercion.\nLibertarian arguments of this kind cast the state as an arbitrator, an\nimpartial agent that makes fair and productive cooperation between\ncitizens possible, much like a referee enables fair play by\nadministering the rules of the game. It is crucial, then, for the\nstate to remain impartial and not choose sides in society or the\neconomy. Once governments begin benefiting one party over another,\nwhether this be certain groups in society or business interests, such\ninvolvement is in principle off-limits and likely to backfire as it\nwill favor whoever is politically well-connected or favored at the\ntime. The minimal state, then, is the only state capable of\nstructuring complex and deeply interdependent societies in ways that\nare mutually beneficial.\n",
