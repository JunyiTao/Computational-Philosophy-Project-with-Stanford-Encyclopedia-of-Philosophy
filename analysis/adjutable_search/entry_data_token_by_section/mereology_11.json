    "main_text": "Composition Principles || Sums\n4.2 Sums\n\nA stronger condition would be to require that any pair of suitably\nrelated entities must have a minimal\nunderlapper\u2014something composed exactly of their parts and\nnothing else. This requirement is sometimes stated by saying that any\nsuitable pair must have a mereological \u201csum\u201d, or\n \u201cfusion\u201d,[18]\n though it is not immediately obvious how this requirement should be\nformulated. Consider the following definitions:\n\n\n(391)\nSum1[19]\n\nS1zxy =df\n\u2200w(Pzw \u2194 (Pxw \u2227\nPyw)) \n\n(392)\nSum2\n\nS2zxy =df Pxz \u2227\nPyz \u2227 \u2200w(Pwz \u2192\n(Owx \u2228 Owy)) \n\n(393)\nSum3\n\nS3zxy =df\n\u2200w(Ozw \u2194 (Owx \u2228\nOwy)) \n\n\n(\u2018Sizxy\u2019 may be read:\n\u2018z is a sumi of x and\ny\u2019. The first notion is found e.g. in Eberle 1967,\nBostock 1979, and van Benthem 1983; the second in Tarski 1935 and\nLewis 1991; the third in Needham 1981, Simons 1987, and Casati and\nVarzi 1999.) Then, for each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, one could\nextend M by adding a corresponding axiom as follows,\nwhere again \u03be specifies a suitable binary condition:\n\n\n(P.12\u03be,i)\n\u03be-Sumi\n\n\u03bexy \u2192\n\u2203zSizxy. \n\n\nIn a way, (P.12\u03be,1) would seem the obvious choice,\ncorresponding to the idea that a sum of two objects is just a minimal\nupper bound of those objects relative to P (a partial ordering).\nHowever, this condition may be regarded as too weak to capture the\nintended notion of a mereological sum. For example, with \u03be\nconstrued as overlap, (P.12\u03be,1) is satisfied by the\nmodel of Figure 7, left: here z is a minimal upper bound of\nx and y, yet z hardly qualifies as a sum\n\u201cmade up\u201d of x and y, since its parts\ninclude also a third, disjoint item w. Indeed, it is a simple\nfact about partial orderings that among finite models\n(P.12\u03be,1) is equivalent to (P.11\u03be), hence\njust as weak.\n\nBy contrast, (P.12\u03be,2) corresponds to a notion of sum\nthat may seem too strong. In a way, it says\u2014literally\u2014that\nany pair of suitably \u03be-related entities x and y\ncompose something, in the sense already discussed in connection with\n(35): they have an upper bound all parts of which overlap either\nx or y. Thus, it rules out the model on the left of\nFigure 7, precisely because w is disjoint from both\nx and y. However, it also rules out the model on the\nright, which depicts a situation in which z may be viewed as\nan entity truly made up of x and y insofar as it is\nultimately composed of atoms to be found either in x or in\ny. Of course, such a situation violates the Strong\nSupplementation principle (P.5), but that's precisely the sense in\nwhich (P.12\u03be,2) may seem too strong: an\nanti-extensionalist might want to have a notion of sum that does not\npresuppose Strong Supplementation.\n\nThe formulation in (P.12\u03be,3) is the natural compromise.\nInformally, it says that for any pair of suitably \u03be-related\nentities x and y there is something that overlaps\nexactly those things that overlap either x or y.\nThis is strong enough to rule out the model on the left, but weak\nenough to be compatible with the model on the right. Note, however,\nthat if the Strong Supplementation axiom (P.5) holds, then\n(P.12\u03be,3) is equivalent to (P.12\u03be,2).\nMoreover, it turns out that if the stronger Complementation axiom\n(P.6) holds, then all of these principles are trivially satisfied in\nany domain in which there is a universal entity: in that case,\nregardless of \u03be, the sum of any two entities is just the complement\nof the difference between the complement of one minus the other. (Such\nis the strength of (P.6), a genuine cross between decomposition and\ncomposition principles.)\n\n\nFigure 7. A sum1 that is not a\nsum3, and a sum3 that is not a sum2.\n\n\nThe intuitive idea behind these principles is in fact best appreciated\nin the presence of (P.5), hence extensionality, for in that case the\nrelevant sums must be unique. Thus, consider the following definition,\nwhere i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} and \u2018\u2129\u2019 is the\ndefinite descriptor):\n\n\n(40i)\n x +i y =df\n\u2129zSizxy. \n\n\nIn the context of EM, each\n(P.12\u03be,i) would then imply that the\ncorresponding sum operator has all the \u201cBoolean\u201d\nproperties one might expect (Breitkopf 1978). For example, as long as\nthe arguments satisfy the relevant condition\n \u03be,[20]\n each +i is idempotent, commutative, and\nassociative,\n\n\n(41)\nx = x +i x \n\n(42)\nx +i y = y\n+i x \n\n(43)\nx +i (y +i\nz) = (x +i y) +i\nz, \n\n\nand well-behaved with respect to parthood:\n\n\n(44)\nPx(x +i y) \n\n(45)\nPxy \u2192 Px(y +i\nz) \n\n(46)\nP(x +i y)z \u2192\nPxz \n\n(47)\nPxy \u2194 x +i y =\ny. \n\n\n(Note that (47) would warrant defining \u2018P\u2019 in terms of\n\u2018+i\u2019, treated as a primitive. For\ni=3, this was actually the option endorsed in Leonard 1930:\n187ff.)\n\nIndeed, here there is room for further developments. For example, just\nas the principles in (P.12\u03be,i) assert the\nexistence of a minimal underlapper for any pair of suitably related\nentities, one may at this point want to assert the existence of a\nmaximal overlapper, i.e., not a \u201csum\u201d but a\n\u201cproduct\u201d of those entities. In the present context, such\nan additional claim can be expressed by the following principle:\n\n\n(P.13\u03be)\n\u03be-Product\n\n\u03bexy \u2192 \u2203zRzxy, \n\n\nwhere \n\n\n(48)\nProduct\n\nRzxy =df \u2200w(Pwz \u2194\n(Pwx \u2227 Pwy)), \n\n\nand \u2018\u03be\u2019 is at least as strong as \u2018O\u2019\n(unless one assumes the Bottom principle (P.10)). In\nEM one could then introduce the corresponding binary\noperator,\n\n\n(49)\nx \u00d7 y =df\n\u2129zRzxy, \n\n\nand it turns out that, again, such an operator would have the\nproperties one might expect. For example, as long as the arguments\nsatisfy the relevant condition \u03be, \u00d7 is idempotent,\ncommutative, and associative, and it interacts with each\n+i in conformity with the usual distribution\nlaws:\n\n\n(50)\nx +i (y \u00d7\nz) = (x +i y) \u00d7\n(x +i z) \n\n(51)\nx \u00d7 (y +i\nz) = (x \u00d7 y) +i\n(x \u00d7 z). \n\n\nNow, obviously (P.13\u03be) does not qualify as a composition\nprinciple in the main sense that we have been considering here, i.e.,\nas a principle that yields a whole out of suitably \u03be-related parts.\nStill, in a derivative sense it does. It asserts the existence of a\nwhole composed of parts that are shared by suitably related\nentities. Be that as it may, it should be noted that such an\nadditional principle is not innocuous unless \u2018\u03be\u2019\nexpresses a condition stronger than mere overlap. For instance, we\nhave said that overlap may be a natural option if one is unwilling to\ncountenance arbitrary scattered sums. It would not, however, be enough\nto avoid embracing scattered products. Think of two C-shaped objects\noverlapping at both extremities; their sum would be a one-piece\nO-shaped object, but their product would consist of two disjoint,\nseparate parts (Bostock 1979: 125). Moreover, and independently, if\n\u03be were just overlap, then (P.13\u03be) would be\nunacceptable for anyone unwilling to embrace mereological\nextensionality. For it turns out that the Strong Supplementation\nprinciple (P.5) would then be derivable from the weaker\nSupplementation principle (P.4) using only the partial ordering axioms\nfor \u2018P\u2019 (in fact, using only Reflexivity and Transitivity;\nsee Simons 1987: 30f). In other words, unless \u2018\u03be\u2019\nexpresses a condition stronger than overlap, MM\ncum (P.13\u03be) would automatically\ninclude EM. This is perhaps even more remarkable, for\non first thought the existence of products would seem to have nothing\nto do with matters of decomposition, let alone a\ndecomposition principle that is committed to extensionality. On second\nthought, however, mereological extensionality is really a\ndouble-barreled thesis: it says that two wholes cannot be decomposed\ninto the same proper parts but also, by the same token, that two\nwholes cannot be composed out of the same proper parts. So it is not\nentirely surprising that as long as proper parthood is well behaved,\nas per (P.4), extensionality might pop up like this in the presence of\nsubstantive composition principles. (It is, however, noteworthy that\nit already pops up as soon as (P.4) is combined with a seemingly\ninnocent thesis such as the existence of products, so the\nanti-extensionalist should keep that in mind.)\n",
