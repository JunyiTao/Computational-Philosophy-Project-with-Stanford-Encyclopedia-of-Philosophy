    "main_text": "Further issues || Amendments to the RTT\n5.3 Amendments to the RTT\n\nWe note three ways to amend the RTT. First, we might put constraints\non which hypotheses are acceptable. For example, Gupta and Belnap 1993\nintroduce a theory, \\(\\mathbf{T}^c\\), of truth based on\nconsistent hypotheses: an hypothesis \\(h\\) is\nconsistent iff the set \\(\\{A:h(A) = \\mathbf{t}\\}\\) is a\ncomplete consistent set of sentences. The relative merits of\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^*, \\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{T}^c\\) are discussed\nin Gupta & Belnap 1993, Chapter 6.\n\nSecond, we might adopt a more restrictive limit policy than\nGupta and Belnap adopt. Recall the question asked in Section 3: How\nshould we set \\(S_{\\eta}(d)\\) when \\(\\eta\\) is a limit ordinal? We\ngave a partial answer: any object that is stably true [false] up\nto that stage should be true [false] at that stage. We\nalso noted that for an object \\(d \\in D\\) that does not stabilize up\nto the stage \\(\\eta\\), Gupta and Belnap 1993 allow us to set\n\\(S_{\\eta}(d)\\) as either \\(\\mathbf{t}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{f}\\). In a\nsimilar context, Herzberger 1982a and 1982b assigns the value\n\\(\\mathbf{f}\\) to the unstable objects. And Gupta originally\nsuggested, in Gupta 1982, that unstable elements receive whatever\nvalue they received at the initial hypothesis \\(S_0\\).\n\nThese first two ways of amending the RTT both, in effect, restrict the\nnotion of a revision sequence, by putting constraints on which of\nour revision sequences really count as acceptable revision\nsequences. The constraints are, in some sense local: the first\nconstraint is achieved by putting restrictions on which hypotheses can\nbe used, and the second constraint is achieved by putting restrictions\non what happens at limit ordinals. A third option would be to put more\nglobal constraints on which putative revision sequences count as\nacceptable. Yaq\u016bb 1993 suggests, in effect, a limit rule whereby\nacceptable verdicts on unstable sentences at some limit stage \\(\\eta\\)\ndepend on verdicts rendered at other limit stages. Yaq\u016bb\nargues that these constraints allow us to avoid certain\n\u201cartifacts\u201d. For example, suppose that a ground model \\(M\n= \\langle D,I\\rangle\\) has two independent liars, by having two names\n\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), where \\(I(\\alpha) = \\neg\n\\boldsymbol{T}\\alpha\\) and \\(I(\\beta) = \\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\beta\\).\nYaq\u016bb argues that it is a mere \u201cartifact\u201d of the\nrevision semantics, naively presented, that there are revision\nsequences in which the sentence \\(\\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\alpha \\equiv\n\\neg \\boldsymbol{T}\\beta\\) is stably true, since the two liars are\nindependent. His global constraints are developed to rule out such\nsequences. (See Chapuis 1996 for further discussion.)\n\nThe first and the second way of amending the RTT are in some sense put\ntogether by Campbell-Moore (2019). Here, the notion of stability for\nobjects is extended to sets of hypotheses: A set \\(H\\) of hypotheses\nis stable in a sequence \\(S\\) of hypotheses if for some ordinal\n\\(\\theta\\) all hypotheses \\(S_{\\zeta}\\), with \\(\\zeta \\ge \\theta\\),\nbelong to \\(H\\). With this, we can introduce the notion of\n\\(P\\)-revision sequence: If \\(P\\) is a class of sets of hypotheses, a\nsequence \\(S\\) is a \\(P\\)-revision sequence just in case that, at\nevery limit ordinal \\(\\eta\\), if a set of hypotheses \\(H\\) belongs to\n\\(P\\) and is stable in \\(S\\), then \\(S_{\\eta}\\) belongs to \\(H\\). It\ncan be shown that, for a suitable choice of \\(P\\), all limit stages of\n\\(P\\)-revision sequences are maximal consistent\nhypotheses.\n5.4 Revision theory for circularly defined concepts\n\nAs indicated in our discussion, in Section 4, of the \u2018iff\u2019\nin the T-biconditionals, Gupta and Belnap present the RTT as a special\ncase of a revision theory of circularly defined concepts. To\nreconsider the example from Section 4. Suppose that \\(L\\) is a\nlanguage with a unary predicate F and a binary predicate R. Consider a\nnew concept expressed by a predicate \\(G\\), introduced through a\ndefinition, \\(D\\), like this: \n\\[\nGx =_{df} A(x,G)\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A(x,G)\\) is the formula \n\\[\n\\forall y(Ryx \\supset Fx) \\vee \\exists y(Ryx \\amp Gx).\n\\]\n\n\nIn this context, a ground model is a classical model \\(M =\n\\langle D,I\\rangle\\) of the language \\(L\\): we start with a domain of\ndiscourse, \\(D\\), and an interpretation of the predicate \\(F\\) and the\nrelation symbol \\(R\\). We would like to extend \\(M\\) to an\ninterpretation of the language \\(L + G\\). So, in this context, an\nhypothesis will be thought of as an hypothesized extension for the\nnewly introduced concept \\(G\\). Formally, a hypothesis is simply a\nfunction \\(h:D \\rightarrow \\{\\mathbf{t}, \\mathbf{f}\\}\\). Given a\nhypothesis \\(h\\), we take \\(M+h\\) to be the classical model \\(M+h =\n\\langle D,I'\\rangle\\), where \\(I'\\) interprets \\(F\\) and \\(R\\) in the\nsame way as \\(I\\), and where \\(I'(G) = h\\). Given a hypothesized\ninterpretation \\(h\\) of \\(G\\), we generate a new interpretation of\n\\(G\\) as follows: and object \\(d \\in D\\) is in the new extension of\n\\(G\\) just in case the defining formula \\(A(x,G)\\) is true of \\(d\\) in\nthe model \\(M+h\\). Formally, we use the ground model \\(M\\) and the\ndefinition \\(D\\) to define a revision rule, \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\),\nmapping hypotheses to hypotheses, i.e., hypothetical interpretations\nof \\(G\\) to hypothetical interpretations of \\(G\\). In particular, for\nany formula \\(B\\) with one free variable \\(x\\), and \\(d \\in D\\), we\ncan define the truth value \\(\\textit{Val}_{M+h,d}(B)\\) in the standard\nway. Then, \n\\[\n\\delta_{D,M}(h)(d) = \\textit{Val}_{M+h,d}(A)\n\\]\n\n\nGiven a revision rule \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\), we can generalize the notion\nof a revision sequence, which is now a sequence of\nhypothetical extensions of \\(G\\) rather than \\(\\boldsymbol{T}\\). We\ncan generalize the notion of a sentence \\(B\\) being stably\ntrue, nearly stably true, etc., relative to a revision\nsequence. Gupta and Belnap introduce the systems \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\), analogous to \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\), as\n follows:[11]\n\nDefinition 5.1.\n\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe ground model \\(M\\) in the system \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\)\n(notation \\(M \\vDash_{*,D} B)\\) iff \\(B\\) is stably true relative to\neach revision sequence for the revision rule \\(\\delta_{D,M}\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe ground model \\(M\\) in the system \\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\)\n(notation \\(M \\vDash_{\\#,D} B)\\) iff \\(B\\) is nearly stably\ntrue relative to each revision sequence for the revision rule\n\\(\\delta_{D,M}\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) (notation \\(\\vDash_{*,D} B)\\) iff for\nall classical ground models \\(M\\), we have \\(M \\vDash_{*,D} B\\).\nA sentence \\(B\\) is valid on the definition \\(D\\) in\nthe system \\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\) (notation \\(\\vDash_{\\#,D} B)\\) iff\nfor all classical ground models \\(M\\), we have \\(M \\vDash_{\\#,D}\nB\\).\n\n\n\nOne of Gupta and Belnap\u2019s principle open questions is whether\nthere is a complete calculus for these systems: that is, whether, for\neach definition \\(D\\), either of the following two sets of sentences\nis recursively axiomatizable: \\(\\{B:\\vDash_{*,D} B\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{B:\\vDash_{\\#,D} B\\}\\). Kremer 1993 proves that the answer is no:\nhe shows that there is a definition \\(D\\) such that each of these sets\nof sentences is of complexity at least \\(\\Pi^{1}_2\\), thereby putting\na lower limit on the complexity of \\(\\mathbf{S}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S}^{\\#}\\). (Antonelli 1994a and 2002 shows that this is also\nan upper limit.)\n\nKremer\u2019s proof exploits an intimate relationship between\ncircular definitions understood revision-theoretically and\ncircular definitions understood as inductive definitions: the\ntheory of inductive definitions has been quite well understood for\nsome time. In particular, Kremer proves that every inductively defined\nconcept can be revision-theoretically defined. The expressive power\nand other aspects of the revision-theoretic treatment of circular\ndefinitions is the topic of much interesting work: see Welch 2001,\nL\u00f6we 2001, L\u00f6we and Welch 2001, and K\u00fchnberger et\nal. 2005.\n\nAlongside Kremer\u2019s limitative result there is the positive\nobservation that, for some semantic system of definitions based on\nrestricted kinds of revision sequences, sound and complete calculi\ndo exist. For instance, Gupta and Belnap give some examples\nof calculi and revision-theoretic systems which use only finite\nrevision sequences. Further investigation on proof-theoretic calculi\ncapturing some revision-theoretic semantic systems is done in Bruni\n2013, Standefer 2016, Bruni 2019, and Fjellstad 2020.\n5.5 Axiomatic Theories of Truth and the Revision Theory\n\nThe RTT is a clear example of a semantically motivated theory of\ntruth. Quite a different tradition seeks to give a satisfying\naxiomatic theory of truth. Granted we cannot retain all of classical\nlogic and all of our intuitive principles regarding truth, especially\nif we allow vicious self-reference. But maybe we can arrive at\nsatisfying axiom systems for truth, that, for example, maintain\nconsistency and classical logic, but give up only a little bit when it\ncomes to our intuitive principles concerning truth, such as the\nT-biconditionals (interpreted classically); or maintain consistency\nand all of the T-biconditionals, but give up only a little bit of\nclassical logic. Halbach 2011 comprehensively studies such axiomatic\ntheories (mainly those that retain classical logic), and Horsten 2011\nis in the same tradition. Both Chapter 14 of Halbach 2011 and Chapter\n8 of Horsten 2011 study the relationship between the Friedman-Sheard\ntheory FS and the revision semantics, with some interesting results.\nFor more work on axiomatic systems and the RTT, see Horsten et al\n2012.\n\nField 2008 makes an interesting contribution to axiomatic theorizing\nabout truth, even though most of the positive work in the book\nconsists of model building and is therefore semantics. In particular,\nField is interested in producing a theory as close to classical logic\nas possible, which retains all T-biconditionals (the conditional\nitself will be nonclassical) and which at the same time can express,\nin some sense, the claim that such and such a sentence is defective.\nField uses tools from multivalued logic, fixed-point semantics, and\nrevision theory to build models showing, in effect, that a very\nattractive axiomatic system is consistent. Field\u2019s construction\nis an intricate interplay between using fixed-point constructions for\nsuccessively interpreting T, and revision sequences for successively\ninterpreting the nonclassical conditional \u2014 the final\ninterpretation being determined by a sort of super-revision-theoretic\nprocess.\n\nThe connection between revision and Field\u2019s theory is explored\nfurther in Standefer 2015b and in Gupta and Standefer 2017.\n5.6 Applications\n\nGiven Gupta and Belnap\u2019s general revision-theoretic treatment of\ncircular definitions \u2014 of which their treatment of\ntruth is a special case \u2014 one would expect\nrevision-theoretic ideas to be applied to other concepts. Antonelli\n1994b applies these ideas to non-well-founded sets: a non-well-founded\nset \\(X\\) can be thought of as circular, since, for some \\(X_0 ,\n\\ldots ,X_n\\) we have \\(X \\in X_0 \\in \\ldots \\in X_n \\in X\\). Chapuis\n2003 applies revision-theoretic ideas to rational decision making.\nThis connection is further developed by Bruni 2015 and by Bruni and\nSillari 2018. For a discussion of revision theory and abstract objects\nsee Wang 2011. For a discussion of revision theory and vagueness, see\nAsmus 2013.\n\nStandefer (2015a) studies the connection between the circular\ndefinitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic RT (for\n\u201cRevision Theory\u201d). Campbell-Moore et al. 2019\nand Campbell-Moore 2021 use revision sequences to model probabilities\nand credences, respectively. Cook 2019 employs a revision-theoretic\nanalysis to find a new possible solution of Benardete\u2019s version\nof the Zeno paradox.\n\nIn recent times, there has been increasing interest in bridging the\ngap between classic debates on the nature of truth \u2014\ndeflationism, the correspondence theory, minimalism, pragmatism, and\nso on \u2014 and formal work on truth, motivated by the liar\u2019s\nparadox. The RTT is tied to pro-sententialism by Belnap 2006;\ndeflationism, by Yaq\u016bb 2008; and minimalism, by Restall 2005.\n\nWe must also mention Gupta 2006. In this work, Gupta argues that an\nexperience provides the experiencer, not with a straightforward\nentitlement to a proposition, but rather with a hypothetical\nentitlement: as explicated in Berker 2011, if subject S has experience\n\\(e\\) and is entitled to hold view \\(v\\) (where S\u2019s\nview is the totality of S\u2019s concepts, conceptions, and\nbeliefs), then S is entitled to believe a certain class of perceptual\njudgements, \\(\\Gamma(v)\\). (Berker uses \u201cpropositions\u201d\ninstead of \u201cperceptual judgements\u201d in his formulation.)\nBut this generates a problem: how is S entitled to hold a view? There\nseems to be a circular interdependence between entitlements to views\nand entitlements to perceptual judgements. Here, Gupta appeals to a\ngeneral form of revision theory \u2014 generalizing beyond both the\nrevision theory of truth and the revision theory of circularly defined\nconcepts (Section 5.4, above) \u2014 to given an account of how\n\u201chypothetical perceptual entitlements could yield categorical\nentitlements\u201d (Berker 2011).\n5.7 An open question\n\nWe close with an open question about \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). Recall Definition 3.11, above, which defines when\na sentence \\(A\\) of a truth language \\(L\\) is valid in the ground\nmodel \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) or by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). We will say that \\(A\\) is valid by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) [alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] iff\n\\(A\\) is valid in the ground model \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\)\n[alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] for every ground model \\(M\\).\nOur open question is this: What is the complexity of the set of\nsentences valid by \\(\\mathbf{T}^* [\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)]?",
