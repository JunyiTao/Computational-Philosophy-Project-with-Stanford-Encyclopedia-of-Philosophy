    "main_text": "Criticizing Naturalism (427d\u2013435d) || The Return of Convention\n8.2 The Return of Convention\n\nSocrates\u2019 convincing arguments against\n (C1)\n and\n (C3)\n lead him to the interim conclusion that even if\n (NAT**)\n holds, etymologically simple correct names imitate the being of their\nreferents only in outline, but not perfectly (432d\u2013433b). His\nnext argument\u2014the so-called skl\u00earot\u00eas\nargument\u2014complements this interim conclusion by undermining\n (C2)\n and re-introducing convention into the picture. The basic\npremise of this argument is the following one:\n\n(P1)\nIf a convention ensures that a name is a means to indicate\n(d\u00ealoma) the being (ousia) of its\n referents,[3]\n the correctness of this name is conventional. (433d\u2013434a)\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 reliance on this premise is a bit surprising. After\nall, he had first introduced the concept of indication when he began\nto elaborate his naturalist theory of correctness at 390e\u2013394e;\nbut now, he is characterizing the assumption that names are used to\nindicate as a shared tenet of naturalism and conventionalism. He must\nbelieve, then, that conventionalism and naturalism do not differ in\ntheir account of the use to which speakers put names, but in their\naccount of what makes this use possible (Ademollo 2011:\n385\u2013388).\n\nAt any rate, Socrates moves on to apply\n (P1)\n to the name skl\u00earon\n (\u201chard\u201d).[4]\n He considers this name a correct etymologically simple name that can\nbe used to indicate the way of being that unites all hard\nthings\u2014hardness. Using the results of his earlier mimetological\ndiscussion of individual letters, he points out that while\nskl\u00earon contains one\nletter\u2014rh\u00f4\u2014that resembles hardness, it also\ncontains one letter\u2014lambda\u2014that resembles the\nopposite of hardness, softness (434c\u2013d). Hence,\nskl\u00earon contains as many letters that resemble the\nopposite of hardness as letters that resemble hardness; and\nconsequently, it cannot be a means to indicate hardness in virtue of\nbeing an imitation of hardness. He then introduces two more premises\nto show that skl\u00earon is such a means in virtue of a\nconvention:\n\n(P2)\nIf a convention ensures that a hearer understands that a speaker\nwho articulates the name skl\u00earon is thinking of\nhardness, then a convention ensures that skl\u00earon is a\nmeans to indicate the being of its referents (= hardness). (435a)\n(P3)\nA convention ensures that a hearer understands that a speaker who\narticulates the name skl\u00earon is thinking of hardness.\n(434e)\n\n\nCratylus does not object to any of this and is compelled to accept the\nfollowing conclusion:\n\n(CONV)\nThe correctness of the name skl\u00earon is conventional\n(435a\u2013b).\n\n\nThis argument is certainly plausible. What is very important to see is\nthat its conclusion is explicitly framed as a claim about the\ncorrectness of the name skl\u00earon. It thus\ncannot be right to assume (as, e.g., Williams 1982: 83) that Socrates\nshows only that skl\u00earon is a name for hardness in\nvirtue of a convention, but not that it is correct in virtue of a\nconvention. As a matter of fact, Socrates does not distinguish between\nnames and correct names at this crucial moment (Barney 2001: 137; cf.\nAdemollo 2011: 2\u20134). And consequently, his argument does not\nonly show that\n (C2)\n is wrong: It also demonstrates that\n (NAT**)\n cannot be true as it stands.\n",
