    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nIn the literature, \u201cdeterminism\u201d is sometimes used as an\numbrella term for a variety of different claims which have\ntraditionally been regarded as threats to free will. Given this usage,\nthe thesis that we are calling \u201cdeterminism\u201d (nomological\ndeterminism, also sometimes called \u2018causal determinism\u2019)\nis just one of several different kinds of determinism, and the free\nwill/determinism problem we will be discussing is one of a family of\nrelated problems. For instance, logical determinism is the\nthesis that the principle of bivalence holds for all propositions,\nincluding propositions about the future, and the problem of free will\nand logical determinism is the problem of deciding whether our belief\nthat we have free will is compatible with the existence of truths\nabout all our future actions. (It should be noted that on this point\nthere is almost universal agreement among philosophers that the answer\nis \u201cyes\u201d.) For more on logical determinism, see the entry\non\n fatalism;\n Taylor 1962; D. Lewis 1976; Merricks 2009; Fischer & Todd 2011;\nVan Cleve 2019; Vihvelin 2013 and 2020. Theological\ndeterminism is the thesis that God exists and has infallible knowledge\nof all true propositions including propositions about our future\nactions; the problem of free will and theological determinism is the\nproblem of understanding how, if at all, we can have free will if God\n(who cannot be mistaken) knows what we are going to do. For\nmore on theological determinism, see the entries on\n fatalism\n and\n divine foreknowledge\n and Fischer & Todd 2015.\n\nIn this entry, we will be restricting our attention to arguments for\nthe incompatibility of free will and nomological determinism, but it\nis important to understand one preliminary point. Nomological and\nlogical determinism are very different kinds of claims. Logical\ndeterminism is a claim about truth; nomological determinism\nis a claim about the natural laws. Logical determinism\ndoesn\u2019t say anything about causation or the laws; it simply says\nthat, regardless of whether we ever come to know them or not, there\nare timelessly true propositions about the past, present, and future,\nincluding our future actions. Logical determinism doesn\u2019t entail\nnomological determinism; it might be true even if nomological\ndeterminism is false. But nomological determinism says (roughly) that\nfacts about the past together with facts about the laws determine all\nthe facts about the future. So if nomological determinism is true,\nthere are true propositions about all our future actions.\n\nWhy does this matter? For the following reason. A common first\nresponse to logical determinism is the fatalist\u2019s response:\n\nIf there are truths about what I will do in the future, then I\nmust do whatever I will do, and so I have no free\nwill.\n\nWhile this response has a powerful intuitive grip (as can be seen from\nmuch of the popular and even scientific discussion of time travel), it\nis generally agreed, by philosophers, that the fatalist is making a\nmistake. Different diagnoses have been given of the \u201cfatalist\nfallacy\u201d or other mistake in modal reasoning, but the basic\npoint is simple. Truth is not the same as necessity; it isn\u2019t\nthe same as logical necessity, metaphysical necessity, or even the\nrelative necessity of unavoidability or lack of ability or power. The\nexistence of a detailed set of truths about my future actions is\nconsistent with my ability to do things other than the things I\nactually do.\n\nIt is of course possible to agree that the existence of\ntruths about all our future actions is compatible with free\nwill while denying that the existence of nomologically\ndetermined truths about all our future actions is compatible with\nfree will. But an argument is needed for this conclusion, an argument\nwhich doesn\u2019t rely on fatalist reasoning or an appeal to\nfatalist intuitions.\n\nFor comparisons between arguments for incompatibilism and arguments\nfor fatalism, see van Inwagen 1983, Mackie 2003, Perry 2004, and\nVihvelin 2008 and 2013.\n\nAt a first approximation, nomological determinism (henceforth\n\u201cdeterminism\u201d), is a contingent and empirical claim about\nthe laws of nature: that they are deterministic rather than\nprobabilistic, and that they are all-encompassing rather than limited\nin scope. At a second approximation, laws are deterministic if they\nentail exceptionless regularities (e.g., that all \\(F\\)s are \\(G\\)s,\nthat all \\(ABCD\\)s are \\(E\\)s) and laws are probabilistic if they say\nthat \\(F\\)s have an objective chance \\(N\\) (less than 1) of being\n\\(G\\)s (note that so-called \u201cstatistical laws\u201d need not be\nprobabilistic laws; see Armstrong 1983, Loewer 1996a). The laws of\nnature are all-encompassing if deterministic or probabilistic laws\napply to everything in the universe, without any exceptions. If, on\nthe other hand, some individuals or some parts of some individuals\n(e.g., the nonphysical minds of human beings) or some of the behaviors\nof some of the individuals (e.g., the free actions of human beings) do\nnot fall under either deterministic or probabilistic laws, then the\nlaws are limited rather than all-encompassing.\n\nFor a more precise articulation of determinism, the contemporary\nliterature offers us two main choices.\n\nDeterminism is standardly defined in terms of entailment, along these\nlines: A complete description of the state of the world at any time\ntogether with a complete specification of the laws entails a complete\ndescription of the state of the world at any other time. (Hoefer 2002,\nMele 2009, Beebee 2013; see also van Inwagen 1983, Ginet 1990, and the\nEncyclopedia entry on\n causal determinism).\n\nAlternatively, following D. Lewis 1973, we might understand\ndeterminism as the thesis that our world is governed by a set of\nnatural laws which is such that any two possible worlds with our\nlaws which are exactly alike at any time are also exactly alike\nat every other time (see also Earman 1986). This second definition of\ndeterminism is stronger than the first; if a possible world is\ndeterministic according to the Lewis/Earman definition, it is\ndeterministic according to the Entailment definition, but not vice\nversa.\n\nLet\u2019s call a possible world \u2018deterministic\u2019 iff the\nthesis of determinism is true at that world;\n\u2018non-deterministic\u2019 iff the thesis of determinism is false\nat that world. There are two very different ways in which a world\nmight be non-deterministic. A world might be non-deterministic because\nat least some of its fundamental laws are probabilistic, or a world\nmight be non-deterministic because it has no laws or because its laws\nare not all-encompassing. Let\u2019s call worlds which are\nnon-deterministic in only the first way \u2018probabilistic\nworlds\u2019 and let\u2019s call worlds which are non-deterministic\nin the second way \u2018lawless\u2019 or \u2018partly\nlawless\u2019 worlds.\n\nDeterminism is a thesis about the statements or propositions that are\nthe laws of our world; it says nothing about whether these statements\nor propositions are knowable by finite beings, let alone whether they\ncould, even in principle, be used to predict all future events. (For\nmore on the relation between determinism and predictability, see the\nEncyclopedia entry on\n Causal Determinism.)\n\nDeterminism, understood according to either of the two definitions\nabove, is neutral with respect to different philosophical accounts of\nlawhood, ranging from the so-called \u201cna\u00efve\nregularity\u201d account (Swartz 1986) to broadly Humean or\n\u201cbest system\u201d accounts (D. Lewis 1973; Earman 1986; Loewer\n1996a; Beebee 2000; Schaffer 2008) to various kinds of necessitarian\naccounts (Armstrong 1983; Carroll 2008). In the book that set the\nstage for much of the contemporary discussion of the free\nwill/determinism problem, van Inwagen 1983 appealed only to two\nrelatively uncontroversial assumptions about the laws of nature: that\nthe propositions that are laws have this status independent of the\nhistory or present state of scientific knowledge and that the laws\nimpose limits on our abilities. Most of the participants in the\ncurrent debate agree, but there are dissenters who think that\ndeterminism must be defined in a metaphysically stronger way, as a\nkind of necessitation relation between particular events (Mumford\n& Anjum 2014). For critique, see Mackie 2014a and Franklin\n2014.\n\nDeterminism (understood according to either of the two definitions\nabove) is not a thesis about causation; it is not the thesis that\ncausation is always a relation between events, and it is not the\nthesis that every event has a cause. If the fundamental laws turn out\nto be probabilistic rather than deterministic, this doesn\u2019t mean\nthat there is no causation; it just means that we have to revise our\ntheories of causation to fit the facts. And this is what philosophers\nof causation have done; there are probabilistic versions of lawful\nentailment theories of causation, of counterfactual theories of\ncausation, and so on, for all major theories of causation (see the\nentries on the\n metaphysics of causation\n and\n counterfactual theories of causation).\n It is now generally accepted that it might be true that every event\nhas a cause even if determinism is false and thus some events lack\nsufficient causes.\n\nMore controversially, it might be true that every event has a cause\neven if our world is neither deterministic nor probabilistic. If there\ncan be causes without laws (if a particular event, object, or person\ncan be a cause, for instance, without instantiating a law), then it\nmight be true, even at a lawless or partly lawless world, that every\nevent has a cause (Anscombe 1981; van Inwagen 1983).\n\nIt\u2019s less clear whether determinism entails the thesis that\nevery event has a cause. Whether it does depends on what the correct\ntheory of causation is; in particular, it depends on what the correct\ntheory says about the relation between causation and law.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that we should not make the\nassumption, almost universally made in the older literature, that the\nthesis that every event has a cause is equivalent to the thesis of\ndeterminism. This is an important point, because some of the older\narguments in the literature against incompatibilism assume\nthat the two claims are equivalent (Hobart 1934).\n\nIn the older literature, it was assumed that determinism is the\nworking hypothesis of science, and that to reject determinism is to be\nagainst science. This no longer seems plausible. Some people think\nthat quantum physics has shown determinism to be false. This remains\ncontroversial (Albert 1992; Loewer 1996b; P. Lewis 2016), but it is\nnow generally agreed that we can reject determinism without accepting\nthe view that the behavior of human beings falls outside the scope of\nnatural laws. If naturalism is the thesis that human behavior can be\nexplained in the same kind of way\u2014in terms of events, natural\nprocesses, and laws of nature\u2014as everything else in the\nuniverse, then we can reject determinism without rejecting\nnaturalism.\n\nNote, finally, that determinism neither entails physicalism nor is\nentailed by it. There are possible worlds where determinism is true\nand physicalism false; e.g., worlds where minds are nonphysical things\nwhich nevertheless obey deterministic laws (van Inwagen 1998). And\nthere are possible worlds (perhaps our own) where physicalism is true\nand determinism is false.\n\nSo much for determinism. What about free will? How should we\nunderstand the disagreement between the compatibilist and the\nincompatibilist?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of room for argument about how, exactly, we should\nunderstand our commonsense beliefs about ourselves as persons with\nfree will. (Are we born with free will? If not, when do we acquire it,\nand in virtue of what abilities or powers do we have it? What is the\ndifference between acting intentionally and acting with free will?)\nLuckily we don\u2019t have to answer these questions in order to say\nwhat is at issue between the compatibilist and the incompatibilist.\nLet\u2019s define the free will thesis as the thesis that at\nleast one non-godlike (human-like) creature has free will, leaving it\nopen what that amounts to. The free will thesis is a minimal\nclaim about free will; it would be true if one person in the universe\nacted with free will (acted freely, acted while possessing free will)\non one occasion. We won\u2019t assume that the free will thesis is\ntrue or even possibly true, but let a free will world be any\npossible world where the free will thesis is true. Since\nnon-determinism is the negation of determinism, and since determinism\nis a contingent thesis, we can divide the set of possible worlds into\ntwo non-overlapping subsets: deterministic worlds and\nnon-deterministic worlds.\n\nGiven this apparatus, we could define incompatibilism and\ncompatibilism in the following way: incompatibilism is the thesis that\nno deterministic world is a free will world. (Equivalently,\nincompatibilism is the claim that necessarily, if determinism is true,\nthen the free will thesis is false.) And we could define compatibilism\nas the denial of incompatibilism; that is, as the claim that some\ndeterministic worlds are free will worlds. (Equivalently,\ncompatibilism is the claim that possibly, determinism and the free\nwill thesis are both true.)\n\nThis way of defining compatibilism is unproblematic. There are\ncompatibilists who are agnostic about the truth or falsity of\ndeterminism, so a compatibilist need not be a soft determinist\n(someone who believes that it is in fact the case that determinism is\ntrue and we have free will). And a compatibilist might believe that we\ndon\u2019t have free will for reasons independent of determinism. But\nall compatibilists believe that it is at least possible that\ndeterminism is true and we have free will. So all compatibilists are\ncommitted to the claim that there are deterministic worlds that are\nfree will worlds.\n\nBut this definition of incompatibilism has a surprising consequence.\nSuppose, as some philosophers have argued, that we lack free will\nbecause free will is conceptually or metaphysically impossible, at\nleast for nongodlike creatures like us (Taylor 1962; G. Strawson 1986,\n1994). If these philosophers are right, there are no free will worlds.\nAnd if there are no free will worlds, it follows that there are no\ndeterministic free will worlds. So if free will is\nconceptually or metaphysically impossible, at least for creatures like\nus, it follows that incompatibilism (as we have just defined it) is\ntrue. But this doesn\u2019t seem right. If it is conceptually or\nmetaphysically impossible for us to have free will, then we lack free\nwill regardless of whether determinism is true or false. And\nif that is so, then the incompatibilist cannot say the kind of things\nshe has traditionally wanted to say: that the truth or falsity of\ndeterminism is relevant to the question of whether or not we\nhave free will, that if determinism were true, then we would lack free\nwill because determinism is true, and so on.\n\nIf we want to avoid this counter-intuitive result, there is a remedy.\nInstead of understanding compatibilism and incompatibilism as\npropositions that are contradictories, we can understand them as\npropositions that are contraries. That is, we can understand\ncompatibilism and incompatibilism as claims that can\u2019t both be\ntrue, but that can both be false. Compatibilism and incompatibilism\nare both false if a third claim, impossibilism, is true. Impossibilism\nis the thesis that free will is conceptually or metaphysically\nimpossible for non-godlike creatures like us.\n\nIf we accept this three-fold classification, we can define our terms\nas follows: Impossibilism is the thesis that there are no free will\nworlds. Incompatibilism is the thesis that there are free will worlds\nbut no deterministic world is a free will world. Compatibilism is the\nthesis that there are free will worlds and free will worlds include\ndeterministic worlds. (For some objections to this three-fold\nclassification see McKenna 2010 and Mickelson 2015a. For defense, see\nVihvelin 2008 and 2013.)\n\nThe term \u2018impossibilism\u2019 is being coined; however, the\nposition it describes is recognized in the literature under a variety\nof names: the \u201cno free will either way\u201d view,\n\u201cnon-realism\u201d, \u201cillusionism\u201d,\n\u201cpessimism\u201d. Theorists who defend impossibilism include G.\nStrawson 1986 and 1994, and Smilansky 2000. Another kind of\nimpossibilist is the fatalist (Taylor 1962).\n\nIn the older literature, there were just two kinds of\nincompatibilists\u2014hard determinists and libertarians. A hard\ndeterminist is an incompatibilist who believes that determinism is in\nfact true (or, perhaps, that it is close enough to being true so far\nas we are concerned, in the ways relevant to free will) and because of\nthis we lack free will (Holbach 1770; Wegner 2003). A libertarian is\nan incompatibilist who believes that we in fact have free will and\nthis entails that determinism is false, in the right kind of way (van\nInwagen 1983). Traditionally, libertarians have believed that\n\u201cthe right kind of way\u201d requires that agents have a\nspecial and mysterious causal power not had by anything else in\nnature: a godlike power to be an uncaused cause of changes in the\nworld (Chisholm 1964). Libertarians who hold this view are committed,\nit seems, to the claim that free will is possible only at worlds that\nare at least partly lawless, and that our world is such a world (but\nsee O\u2019Connor 2000, Clarke 2003 and Steward 2012). But in the\ncontemporary literature there are incompatibilists who avoid such\nrisky metaphysical claims by arguing that free will is possible at\nworlds where some of our actions have indeterministic event causes\n(Kane 1996, 1999, 2008, 2011a; Ekstrom 2000; Balaguer 2010; Franklin\n2018) or that free will is possible at worlds where some of our\nactions are uncaused (Ginet 1990). Note that none of these three kinds\nof incompatibilists (agent-causation theorists, indeterministic\nevent-causation theorists, non-causal theorists) need be libertarians.\nThey may reserve judgment about the truth or falsity of determinism\nand therefore reserve judgment about whether or not we in fact have\nfree will. They might also be hard determinists because they believe\nthat determinism is in fact true. But what they do believe\u2014what\nmakes them incompatibilists\u2014is that it is possible for\nus to have free will and that our having free will depends on a\ncontingent fact about the laws that govern the\nuniverse: that they are indeterministic in the right kind of way. (See\nthe entry on\n incompatibilist theories of free will).\n\nGiven these definitions and distinctions, we can now take the first\nstep towards clarifying the disagreement between compatibilists and\nincompatibilists. Both sides agree that it is conceptually and\nmetaphysically possible for us to have free will; their disagreement\nis about whether any of the possible worlds where we have free will\nare deterministic worlds. The compatibilist says \u2018yes\u2019;\nthe incompatibilist says \u2018no\u2019. Arguments for\nincompatibilism must, then, be arguments for the claim that\nnecessarily, if determinism is true, we lack the free will we might\notherwise have.\n",
