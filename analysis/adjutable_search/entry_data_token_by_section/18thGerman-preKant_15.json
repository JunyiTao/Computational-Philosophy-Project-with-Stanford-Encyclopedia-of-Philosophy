Leibniz exchanged letters with a number\nof women, but his correspondence with his patroness Electress Sophie\nof Hanover (1630\u20131714), who happened to be the sister of\nElisabeth of Bohemia, and her daughter Queen Sophie Charlotte of\nPrussia (1668\u20131705), is particularly significant as it\nfrequently turned to philosophical topics. In his letters, and his\npersonal exchanges with \u201cthe two Sophies\u201d, Leibniz can be\nseen to refine and develop key doctrines, including his conception of\nsubstance and his attempted theodicy (Strickland 2011: 35\u201348),\nwhere Leibniz himself claimed that his Theodic\u00e9e found\nits beginnings in his conversations with Sophie Charlotte. Sophie of\nHanover likewise supplied Leibniz with one of his favourite pieces of\nempirical evidence for the principle of the identity of indiscernables\n(when she challenged a courtier to find two identical leaves during a\ngarden stroll). Sophie of Hanover was no dogmatic Leibnizian however,\nas she maintained her commitment to physical influence between the\nmind and the body, and hosted controversial figures such as Francis\nMercury Van Helmont (1614\u20131699) and John Toland\n(1670\u20131722) at her court. It is, however, debated whether Sophie\nshared the materialist views of these thinkers when it comes to the\nmind (de Careil 1876; Strickland 2009 and 2011: 49\u201364) or\ninstead upheld a metaphysically agnostic view regarding the nature of\nthe soul (Leduc 2021).\n\nAs for the other founder of the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, Wolff\ndoes not seem to have been similarly influenced by interaction with\nwomen in the development of his system. Through adopting the\nvernacular for his initial series of textbooks, however, he did at\nleast indirectly contribute to making the latest innovations in\nmetaphysics, ethics, politics, and physics accessible to a wider\nliterate audience including women. Indeed, this hardly seems to have\nbeen an undesired consequence as, at one point, at the urging of the\nSaxon nobleman and Wolffian devot\u00e9e Ernst Christoph Graf von\nManteuffel (1676\u20131749), Wolff drafted the beginning of an\nintroduction to Wolffian philosophy intended specifically for women\n(cf. Ostertag 1910). In the 1740s and 1750s in particular, Wolffian\nphilosophy had gained such a following among women of society that one\ncommentator quipped that it was as if \u201can actual\nlycanthropy\u201d had broken out (Edelmann 1740: 108). Among those\nwomen so influenced was \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet\n(1706\u201349), who made use of foundational Wolffian metaphysical\nprinciples in her presentation of Newton\u2019s physics in her\nInstitutions de physique\u2014Wolff and du Ch\u00e2telet\nengaged in correspondence for a time, and he commended her mastery of\nhis system to others and appraised her as a more talented philosopher\nthan her companion Voltaire.\n\nIn addition to du Ch\u00e2telet, a number of women took up the task\nof defending and developing Leibnizian-Wolffian ideas. None were more\nactive in this than Luise Adelgunde Viktorie Gottsched\n(n\u00e9e Kulmus, 1713\u201362), whose husband Johann\nChristoph\n (\u00a74.2\n above) was a Wolffian disciple who made contributions to philosophy\n(metaphysics and aesthetics), as well as to literary theory and the\ndevelopment of German letters. In virtue of her ambitious education\n(especially in languages), Luise Gottsched contributed extensively to\nJohann Christoph\u2019s efforts to promote German letters and\ntheatre, and was a prolific translator, both in the context of her\nhusband\u2019s ambitious projects and in her own right. Thus, she\nmade substantial contributions to Johann Christoph\u2019s\ntranslations of Leibniz\u2019s Theodic\u00e9e (J. C.\nGottsched 1744) and of Bayle\u2019s Dictionaire historique et\ncritique (1741\u201344) (for other philosophical translations,\nsee Brown 2012). She also translated R\u00e9flexions nouvelles\nsur les femmes (1727; L. A. V. Gottsched 1731) by the Parisian\nsalonni\u00e8re Anne-Th\u00e9s\u00e8se, Marquise de\nLambert and produced a translation of and an original response to\nMadeleine Ang\u00e9lique Poisson de Gomez\u2019s Le triomphe de\nl\u2019\u00e9loquence (1730; L. A. V. Gottsched 1739), which\nemphasized the importance of education (including philosophy) for\nwoman\u2019s cultivation of virtue.\n\nAnother notable figure in this respect is Johanna Charlotte Unzer\n(n\u00e9e Ziegler, 1725\u201382), who was raised in an\nintellectual family in Halle: her uncle J. G. Kr\u00fcger\n(1715\u201359) was a well-known Wolffian scientist, and\nBaumgarten\u2019s student G. F. Meier was a close family friend.\nUnzer herself would become a renowned poet, though she produced a\nhighly original philosophical contribution to Wolffian thought in her\nGrundri\u00df einer Weltweisheit f\u00fcr das Frauenzimmer\n(Outline of a Philosophy for the Lady) of 1751. In that text,\nUnzer seeks to present the doctrines of Leibnizian-Wolffian logic and\nmetaphysics in an aesthetically perfect manner, often making use of\npoetry to provide a moving illustration of an otherwise abstruse\ntheorem. In the process, Unzer grants German women access to the most\nchallenging and controversial philosophical debates of her time\n(including Wolff\u2019s account of scientific reasoning, the\nchallenge of materialism, and the Leibnizian doctrine of monads) with\nthe express intention of equipping her female readers to engage in\nspeculative and scientific investigations themselves. At the same\ntime, she offers a dynamic revision and re-orientation of the Wolffian\nphilosophy which, significantly, attempts to carve out a space for the\n(as yet unfounded) discipline of aesthetics (Buchenau 2021).\n",
