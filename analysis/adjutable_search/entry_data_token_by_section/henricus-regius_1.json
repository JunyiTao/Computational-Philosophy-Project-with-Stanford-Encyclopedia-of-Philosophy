    "main_text": "Dispute with Voetius and Descartes\n2. Dispute with Voetius and Descartes\n\n\nRegius attributed his appointment at Utrecht University to his\nfamiliarity with and support for Cartesian philosophy, which was\nacquired initially by reading Descartes\u2019 first book, the Discours\nde la M\u00e9thode \u2026 plus la Dioptrique, les\nM\u00e9t\u00e9ores et la G\u00e9ometrie, 1637 (AT,\nvol. VI). Regius was sympathetic to Cartesian natural philosophy from\nhis initial reading and began to teach it to students, in private\nlessons, and to dictate notes with a view to publishing his own\nsummary of natural philosophy based on Cartesian principles. This\nobjective was further encouraged when he read a copy of Descartes\u2019\nunpublished manuscript, Le Monde (AT, vol.  XI), in 1641. The\nnatural philosophy of Le Monde rejected scholastic forms and\nqualities as philosophical entities that contributed nothing to an\nexplanation of natural phenomena. There was a significant difference,\nhowever, in a university such as Utrecht between not relying on\nscholastic forms and criticizing them publicly. The transition from\nthe former to the latter, in the case of Regius, occurred in 1641.\n\n\nWhile preparing Physiologia (Regius 1641a), Regius sent\nadvance copies of draft disputations to Descartes. Since they were\nbeing presented in Utrecht as examples of Cartesian philosophy,\nDescartes recommended various changes, both to avoid needless\ncontroversy (for example, concerning blood circulation) and, more\nimportantly, to avoid accusations of heresy against himself or\nRegius. Accordingly, he asked Regius to correct the thesis that the\nhuman soul is three-fold, and to argue instead that \u201cin human\nbeings the soul is one, namely a rational soul\u201d (AT III,\n369\u201374: Bos 2002, 63\u201369). During the year 1641, this\npattern of prior consultation with Descartes continued; Regius\naccepted many of Descartes\u2019 suggestions, and incorporated them into\nthe final versions of the disputations.\n\n\nIn November 1641, however, the Utrecht professor inaugurated another\nseries of disputations in which he transgressed from medicine to\nphilosophy and, by implication, into theology, and thereby provoked a\ncontroversy that continued for more than a decade. The most explicit\nchallenge to established Aristotelian teaching occurred when one of\nRegius\u2019 students, Henricus van Loon, claimed in a disputation (8\nDecember 1641) that the human mind and body are two distinct\nsubstances which are joined together in an accidental union [unum\nper accidens].  This thesis addressed, perhaps inadvertently, one\nof the most contentious issues in Christian philosophy and\ntheology, viz.  how to understand the unity of human nature,\nas experienced by each subject, and at the same time defend the\ntraditional Christian beliefs in the immortality of the human soul or\nmind and the resurrection of the body. The immortality of the soul\nseemed to presuppose that the mind or soul was capable of existing\nwithout the body and, for that reason, that it should be classified as\nan Aristotelian substance. When Descartes was informed about this\ndisputation (when it was already too late to recommend amendments), he\nresponded that there was hardly anything more likely to offend or\nantagonize theologians than to say that a human being \u201cis an\naccidental being\u201d (AT III, 460: Bos 2002, 90\u201391).\n\n\nVoetius, with the support of his professorial colleagues in theology,\nreplied to Regius by appending corollaries to his own theological\ndisputations, in December 1641, in which he accused proponents of the\n\u2018new philosophy\u2019 [i.e., Cartesianism] of a number of\nerrors: teaching that a human being is an accidental being, defending\nCopernicanism, and supporting scepticism and irreligion by denying\nsubstantial forms. In the course of these replies to Regius,\nDescartes\u2019 name was also mentioned, and it was clear that Regius and\nDescartes were perceived by Voetius as jointly attempting to undermine\nthe philosophical foundations of Calvinist theology as taught at\nUtrecht. Initially, Descartes joined the debate merely by advising\nRegius how to respond appropriately to Voetius. One part of that\nadvice was that Regius should have dealt with substantial forms as\nDescartes had done in the M\u00e9t\u00e9ores (AT VI,\n239): that he should not have rejected them explicitly but, instead,\nshould merely have omitted them as redundant to genuine\nexplanations.\n\n\nHowever, Descartes also provided Regius with philosophical arguments\nin reply to Voetius. He outlined a number of reasons why they were\njointly opposed to describing the human mind as a substantial form. To\nsay that human beings think because they have a \u2018thinking\nform\u2019 explains nothing; secondly, those who postulate the\nexistence of substantial forms are unable to say more precisely what\nthey are, and thus they appeal to \u2018occult\u2019 realities that\nthey do not understand; and, perhaps most importantly, if the alleged\nsubstantial forms of other natural phenomena were made redundant by \ndevelopments in physics, there would be a danger that the spirituality\nof the mind or soul would be compromised by similar advances in the\nsciences.  \u201cAll the arguments that are used to prove substantial\nforms may be applied to the form of a clock, although no one claims\nthat it is substantial\u201d (AT III, 505: Bos 2002, 115). Many of\nDescartes\u2019 suggestions were incorporated, as amendments, into the\nfinal version of the Regius\u2019 reply to Voetius, which appeared as\nResponsio, sive notae in Appendicem (Regius 1642) on 16\nFebruary 1642. This further inflamed the situation. The following\nmonth, Regius was forbidden by the University to teach natural philosophy in\npublic or in private, and was restricted to lecturing in traditional\nmedicine. The Academic Senate, with the approval of\nthe town council, also issued an official condemnation of Cartesian\nphilosophy. \n\n\nDescartes later joined the controversy in a more public way. He\nincluded a letter to a French Jesuit, \u2018A Letter to Father\nDinet,\u2019 in the second edition of the Meditations (1642),\nwhich was published in Amsterdam and thus became readily available to\nhis critics in Utrecht. While the letter to Dinet criticised Voetius\nwithout naming him explicitly, Descartes\u2019 subsequent\nEpistola ad Voetium (1643) went further by removing the\napparent anonymity of his target in the first letter. The complex\nhistory of the next few years, which is summarized in Verbeek 1992,\nincluded an official ban on the teaching of Cartesian philosophy by the\nlocal authority in Utrecht (the Vroedschap), and the establishment by\nthe same authority of a committee of inquiry into the public\ncontroversy that resulted from Regius\u2019 teaching of Cartesian\nphilosophy. The official report of the university committee on the\nwhole affair, to date, was published in 1643 as the Narratio\nhistorica (Verbeek 1988, 71\u2013123). Meantime, Voetius arranged\nfor one of his supporters, Martinus Schoock (1614\u201369), to write\nan extensive critique of Descartes and Cartesianism, which was\npublished as Admiranda methodus (The Admirable\nMethod) in Utrecht in 1643 (Schoock 1643). The\nAdmirable Method listed, among the most serious charges against\nDescartes, that he was an atheist and a sceptic, and it implied that he\ndeserved the same treatment as heretics, such as Giulio Cesare Vanini\n(1585\u20131619), who had been burned at the stake in Toulouse. While\nthe authorship of this book, Descartes\u2019 replies to it, and\nvarious legal charges of defamation and libel continued for some years,\nDescartes concluded his contribution to the controversy with Voetius in\nthe Apologetic Letter to the Magistrates of Utrecht, which was\nwritten in 1647 and sent to Utrecht in February 1648 (Bos 1999).\n\n\nThe intensity of the dispute between Voetius and those whom he\nidentified as proponents of a \u2018new philosophy\u2019 might\nsuggest agreement, at least between Descartes and Regius, on a common\nphilosophical position. In the course of the Utrecht controversy,\nhowever, an irretrievable breakdown developed in relations between\nDescartes and his former supporter. The epistemology favoured by\nRegius, which reflected his disciplinary expertise in medicine and\nphysiology, left little room for Cartesian metaphysics. When he wrote\nto Descartes, in July 1645 (AT IV, 254\u20136: Bos 2002,\n189\u201390), that many reputable people believed that Descartes\nsecretly held views about the human mind and God that differed from\nthose that he published, and that he had discredited his philosophy by\npublishing the Meditations, it seemed to Descartes that Regius\nwas endorsing the same criticisms that Voetius and Schoock had\nmade earlier. The following year, against Descartes\u2019 advice, Regius published\nthe Fundamenta physices, in which he rejected a number of\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysical theses and thereby incurred the wrath of\nhis former mentor. The French philosopher denounced Regius, as\nmisrepresenting his philosophy, in the preface to the French edition of\nthe Principles of Philosophy (1647). Regius planned to reply\nby adding twenty-one Corollaries to a medical disputation that was scheduled\nfor 2 October 1647, concerning a forty-year old man who had\ninflammation of the feet and legs (Regius 1647b). These Corollaries\nincluded three of the more contentious claims about the mind and God\nthat Regius had earlier removed from Fundamenta physices in\nan unsuccessful attempt to appease Descartes. Although the\ndisputation was banned by the University rector, Regius had already\ndisseminated copies of the text, including the controversial\nCorollaria. Descartes replied with Notae in programma\nquoddam (1648)\u2014i.e., Notes on a Certain\nManifesto\u2014to which Regius replied with an extended version\nof the Corollaria, in A Brief Explanation of the Human Mind\nor the Rational Soul, in which is explained what it is and what it may\nbe (Regius 1648).\n\n\nThe main source of disagreement between Descartes and Regius was their\nrespective accounts of human nature. This had emerged as early as\n1640, when Regius commented on a draft of the Meditations,\nand more explicitly in the disputation (December 1641), which proposed\nthe thesis that the human mind and body are united in an\n\u2018accidental unity.\u2019 In July 1645, when Descartes responded\nto a draft of the Fundamenta\nphysices, he argued that Regius had gone too far in the\nopposite direction by making the union of mind and body so close that\nthe mind was merely a \u2018mode\u2019 of the body\u2014which was\nan even greater error than his earlier mistake (AT IV, 250: Bos 2002,\n188). This issue, of how to conceive of the mind and body as united\nand yet separable, dominated the series of claims and counter-claims\nmade by both philosophers up to 1648. Between 1648 and February 1650,\nwhen Descartes died, the two philosophers did not engage directly with\neach other. Descartes discussed a range of questions with Burman in\n1648, and in response to one query he provided another reminder of the\nextent to which Regius allegedly misunderstood his\nmetaphysics. \u201cAs far as Regius is concerned \u2026 in physics\nhe has always been anxious to follow the views of the author [i.e.,\nDescartes] \u2026 whereas in metaphysics he has done everything\npossible to contradict the author\u2019s views\u201d (Descartes CB, 38:\nAT V, 170).  Descartes\u2019 last publication, Les Passions de\nl\u2019Ame (1649: AT, vol. XI), may be read as his final attempt to\naddress the source of their disagreement, and Regius 1650 may be seen\nas Regius\u2019 response (Verbeek 2017).\n",
