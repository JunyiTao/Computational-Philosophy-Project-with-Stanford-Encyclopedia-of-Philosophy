    "main_text": "Cosmology and Argument Against Natural Theology\n4. Cosmology and Argument Against Natural Theology\n\n\nWright had interesting and original views about the origin of the\nuniverse and changes in the\n heavens.[14]\n He saw no evidence in astronomical data or known scientific law for\nascribing purpose or direction to the evolution of the cosmos as a\nwhole. He believed it most likely that the universe is eternal,\nconstituting \u201can order without beginning and without\ntermination\u201d (PD 4). It is governed by the principle of\n\u201ccounter-movements,\u201d which he believed was manifest\nalready in biological phenomena in the cycle of life and death,\nnutrition and decay. Gravitation and heat were the chief forces\ninvolved in counter-movements. Geology manifests the principle, in the\nrelation of forces producing elevations, compressions, erosion, and\ndeposits, and it is even more markedly evident in meteorological\nphenomena. Wright believed that changes in interstellar space\nconstituted, in a way similar to meteorology, \u201ccosmical\nweather\u201d (PD 10). He was concerned that the nebular\nhypothesis of the origin of solar systems, presented as a plausible\nscientific hypothesis by Laplace and supported by the observations of\nHerschel, was too readily taken in support of a \u201cdevelopmental\nhypothesis\u201d about the universe, namely that the universe was\ncreated and had evolved toward an end congenial to supporting human\nlife. For Wright, teleological notions in science were always\nanathema. He accepted the nebular hypothesis in terms of the physical\nlaws that yielded the developmental hypothesis, both in astronomy and\nbiology. But he called it the \u201cderivative hypothesis\u201d to\nconnote the fact that \u201cin several classes of phenomena hitherto\nregarded as ultimate and inexplicable, physical explanations are\nprobable and legitimate\u201d (PD 17). He meant by this that\nscientific cosmology need entertain no extra-scientific principles as\nfundamental: \u201cthe constitution of the solar system is not\narchetypal, as the ancients supposed, but the same corrupt mixture of\nlaw and apparent accident that the phenomena of the earth's surface\nexhibit\u201d (PD 9).\n\n\nWright was aware that the second law of thermodynamics militated\nagainst his cosmology of cosmic weather continuing in an endless\nsuccession of phenomena in infinite time. But he believed the\n\u201ctendency to diffuse the mechanical energies of nature\u201d\nthat was characteristic of the laws of heat was considered too narrowly\nby Thomson and others. There was a \u201cround of actions\u201d in\nthe complex interactions of heat and gravitation through space that set\nup the counter-movements of continuous change (L 177). To the\nscientific Aristotelian mind that Wright claimed to have, the theory of\n\u201cwasting\u201d raised more questions than it answered, and so he\ndeferred his own full acceptance of it (PD 87). Wright's\napproach to this issue illustrates his penchant, evident also in his\nacute and ready understanding of natural selection, to focus on\nlarge-scale effects of natural law as making sense of nature. In this,\nhis mind worked against the reductionist tendencies of philosophers who\nhad less experience with and sympathy for science itself. He was\ninterested in the persistent patterns evident to sense perception set\nup by the operation of natural law at levels inaccessible to\nperception.\n\n\nA constant theme for Wright is the rejection of\nnatural theology. He did not believe that there could be philosophical\narguments, starting from natural phenomena, whether motion or the\nintelligible forms of living things, that prove the existence of a\ndeity. He also believed it was impossible to identify in nature genuine\nfinal causes, ends present naturally that are always prior to the\nsubordinate causes that bring about those ends. He said:\nBy what criterion \u2026 can we distinguish among the\nnumberless effects, that are also causes, and among the causes that\nmay, for aught we can know, be also effects, \u2014 how can we\ndistinguish which are the means and which are the ends? (PD\n36).\n\n\nThat the universe has a purpose or that the forms of living things\ngiven by nature have an inevitability or natural priority to them can\nbe believed on grounds of faith but can in no way be disclosed or\nsupported by scientific investigation of nature. Perhaps judging from\nthe state of philosophy and theology in the American institutions of\nhigher learning in the mid-nineteenth century, Wright believed that\nmetaphysics had no other purpose than the service of natural theology.\nHe was never precise about what he meant by metaphysics, but he said\nthat the motives for theological and metaphysical speculation come\nfrom \u201cthe active emotional life of man\u201d (PD\n49\u201350). He seemed to equate metaphysics and philosophy. He\ncontinued, \u201cThe questions of philosophy proper are human desires\nand fears and aspirations \u2014 human emotions \u2014 taking an\nintellectual form\u201d (PD 50). A spirit of inquiry free of\nthese influences motivates science, but it is \u201cnecessarily, at\nall times, a weak feeling\u201d and could have little effect on\ncivilization until a body of scientific learning had been\ndeveloped. He said, \u201cAnd we owe science to the combined energies\nof individual men of genius, rather than to any tendency to progress\ninherent in civilization\u201d (PD 51). Philosophy belongs\nwith the fine arts and religion. Its attainments are not great but its\nmotives are noble (PD 52). This ad hominen argument\nagainst philosophers \u2014 that their enterprise is not rational and\ndisinterested \u2014 would have found ready reinforcement in Comte's\nrejection of metaphysics in favor of scientific method. Wright never\nfollowed Comte, however, in Comte's recommendation of a religion of\nhumanity to take the place of religion for the masses. Although\nWright's own thinking is highly philosophical, the rejection of\nmetaphysics and philosophy together is fundamental for him and lies in\nthe background of all his pronouncements in philosophy of science.\n",
