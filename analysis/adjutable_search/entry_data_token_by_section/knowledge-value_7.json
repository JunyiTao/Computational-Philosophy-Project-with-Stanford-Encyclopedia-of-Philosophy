    "main_text": "The Value of True Belief\n8. The Value of True Belief\n\nSo far, in common with most of the contemporary literature in this\nregard, we have tended to focus on the value of knowledge relative to\nother epistemic standings. A related debate in this respect,\nhowever\u2014one that has often taken place largely in tandem with\nthe mainstream debate on the value of knowledge\u2014has specifically\nconcerned itself with the value of true belief and we will turn now to\nthis issue.\n\nFew commentators treat truth or belief as being by themselves valuable\n(though see Kvanvig 2003: ch. 1), but it is common to treat true\nbelief as valuable, at least instrumentally. True beliefs are clearly\noften of great practical use to us. The crucial caveat here,\nof course, concerns the use of the word \u2018often\u2019. After\nall, it is also often the case that a true belief might actually\nmilitate against one achieving one\u2019s goals, as when one is\nunable to summon the courage to jump a ravine and thereby get to\nsafety, because one knows that there is a serious\npossibility that one might fail to reach the other side. In such cases\nit seems that a false belief in one\u2019s abilities\u2014e.g., the\nfalse belief that one could easily jump the ravine\u2014would be\nbetter than a true belief, if the goal in question (jumping the\nravine) is to be achieved.\n\nMoreover, some true beliefs are beliefs in trivial matters, and in\nthese cases it isn\u2019t at all clear why we should value such\nbeliefs at all. Imagine someone who, for no good reason, concerns\nherself with measuring each grain of sand on a beach, or someone who,\neven while being unable to operate a telephone, concerns herself with\nremembering every entry in a foreign phone book. Such a person would\nthereby gain lots of true beliefs but, crucially, one would regard\nsuch truth-gaining activity as rather pointless. After all, these true\nbeliefs do not seem to serve any valuable purpose, and so do not\nappear to have any instrumental value (or, at the very least, what\ninstrumental value these beliefs have is vanishingly small). It would,\nperhaps, be better\u2014and thus of greater value\u2014to have fewer\ntrue beliefs, and possibly more false ones, if this meant that the\ntrue beliefs that one had concerned matters of real consequence.\n\nAt most, then, we can say that true beliefs often have instrumental\nvalue. What about final (or intrinsic) value? One might think that if\nthe general instrumental value of true belief was moot then so too\nwould be the intuitively stronger thesis that true belief is generally\nfinally valuable. Nevertheless, many have argued for such a claim.\n\nOne condition that seems to speak in favor of this thesis is that as\ntruth seekers we are naturally curious about what the truth is, even\nwhen that truth is of no obvious practical import. Accordingly, it\ncould be argued that from a purely epistemic point of view, we do\nregard all true belief as valuable for its own sake, regardless of\nwhat further prudential goals we might have (e.g., Goldman 1999: 3;\nLynch 2004: 15\u201316; Alston 2005: 31; Pritchard 2019; cf. Baehr\n2012: 5). Curiosity will only take you so far in this regard, however,\nsince we are only curious about certain truths, not all of them. To\nreturn to the examples given a moment ago, no fully rational agent is\ncurious about the measurements of every grain of sand on a given\nbeach, or the name of every person in a random phone book\u2014i.e.,\nno rational person wants to know these truths independently of having\nsome prudential reason for knowing them.\n\nStill, one could argue for a weaker claim and merely say that it is\nprima facie or pro tanto finally good to believe the\ntruth (cf. David 2005; Lynch 2009), where cases of trivial truths such\nas those just given are simply cases where, all things\nconsidered, it is not good to believe the truth. After all, we\nare familiar with the fact that something can be prima facie\nor pro tanto finally good without being all-things-considered\ngood. For example, it may be finally good to help the poor and needy,\nbut not all-things-considered good given that helping the poor and\nneedy would prevent you from doing something else which is at present\nmore important (such as saving that child from drowning).\n\nAt this point one might wonder why it matters so much to (some)\nepistemologists that true belief is finally valuable. Why not instead\njust treat true belief as often of instrumental value and leave the\nmatter at that? The answer to this question lies in the fact that many\nwant to regard truth\u2014and thereby true belief\u2014as being the\nfundamental epistemic goal, in the sense that ultimately it is only\ntruth that is epistemically valuable (so, for example, while\njustification is epistemically valuable, it is only epistemically\nvaluable because of how it is a guide to truth). Accordingly, if true\nbelief is not finally valuable\u2014and only typically instrumentally\nvaluable\u2014then this seems to downplay the status of the\nepistemological project.\n\nThere are a range of options here. The conservative option is to\ncontend that truth is the fundamental goal of epistemology and also\ncontend that true belief is finally valuable\u2014at least in some\nrestricted fashion. Marian David (2001, 2005) falls into this\ncategory. In contrast, one might argue that truth is the fundamental\ngoal while at the same time claiming that true belief is not\nfinally valuable. Sosa (see especially 2004, but also 2000a, 2003)\nseems (almost) to fall into this camp, since he claims that while\ntruth is the fundamental epistemic value, we can accommodate this\nthought without having to thereby concede that true belief is finally\nvaluable, a point that has been made in a similar fashion by Alan\nMillar (2011: \u00a73). Sosa often compares the epistemic domain to\nother domains of evaluation where the fundamental good of that domain\nis not finally valuable. So, for example, the fundamental goal of the\n\u2018coffee-production\u2019 domain may be great tasting coffee,\nbut no-one is going to argue that great tasting coffee is finally\nvaluable. Perhaps the epistemic domain is in this respect like the\ncoffee-production domain?\n\nAnother line of response against the thesis that true belief is\nfinally valuable is to suggest that this thesis leads to a\nreductio. Michael DePaul (2001) has notably advanced such an\nargument. According to DePaul, the thesis that true belief is finally\nvaluable implies that all true beliefs are equally epistemically\nvaluable. Though this latter claim, DePaul argues, is false, as is\nillustrated by cases where two sets each containing an equal number of\ntrue beliefs intuitively differ in epistemic value. Ahlstrom-Vij and\nGrimm (2013) have criticized DePaul\u2019s claim that the thesis that\ntrue belief is finally valuable implies that two sets each containing\nan equal number of true beliefs must not differ in epistemic value.\nAdditionally, Nick Treanor (2014) has criticized the argument for a\ndifferent reason, which is that (contra DePaul) there is no\nclear example of two sets which contain the same number of true\nbeliefs. More recently, Xingming Hu (2017) has defended the final\nvalue of true belief against DePaul\u2019s argument, though Hu argues\nfurther that neither Ahlstrom-Vij and Grimm\u2019s (2013) nor\nTreanor\u2019s (2014) critique of DePaul\u2019s argument is\ncompelling.\n\nAnother axis on which the debate about the value of true belief can be\nconfigured is in terms of whether one opts for an epistemic-value\nmonism or an epistemic-value pluralism\u2014that is, whether one\nthinks there is only one fundamental epistemic goal, or several.\nKvanvig (e.g., 2005) endorses epistemic-value pluralism, since he\nthinks that there are a number of fundamental epistemic goals, with\neach of them being of final value. Crucial to Kvanvig\u2019s argument\nis that there are some epistemic goals which are not obviously\ntruth-related\u2014he cites the examples of having an empirically\nadequate theory, making sense of the course of one\u2019s experience,\nand inquiring responsibly, and more recently, Brent Madison (2017) has\nargued by appealing to a new evil demon thought experiment, that\nepistemic justification itself should be included in such a list. This\nis important because if the range of goals identified were all\ntruth-related, then it would prompt the natural response that such\ngoals are valuable only because of their connection to the truth, and\nhence not fundamental epistemic goals at all.\n\nPresumably, though, it ought also to be possible to make a case for an\nepistemic-value pluralism where the fundamental epistemic goals were\nnot finally valuable (or, at least, \u00e0 la Sosa, where\none avoided taking a stance on this issue). More precisely, if an\nepistemic-value monism that does not regard the fundamental epistemic\ngoal as finally valuable can be made palatable, then there seems no\nclear reason why a parallel view that opted for pluralism in this\nregard could not similarly be given a plausible supporting story.\n",
