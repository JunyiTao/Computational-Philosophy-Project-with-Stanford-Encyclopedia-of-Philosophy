    "main_text": "Arrow\u2019s Framework || Multiple Profiles\n2.2 Multiple Profiles\nArrow required aggregation procedures to derive social orderings\nfrom more than just a single profile, representing\neveryone\u2019s actual preferences. In his framework they must\nreckon with many profiles, representing preferences that the\npeople could have.\nVariety among preferences is the result, in Arrow\u2019s account, of the\ndifferent standards by which we assess our options. Our preferences\ndepend on our \u201ctastes\u201d in personal consumption but\nimportantly, for social choice, they also depend on our socially\ndirected \u201cvalues\u201d. Now, we are to some extent free to have\nvarious tastes, values, and preferences; and we are free, also, to\nhave these independently of one another. Any individual can have a\nrange of preferences, then, and for any given sets of people and\nalternatives there are many possible preference profiles. One profile\n\\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) represents the preferences of these people\namong their alternatives in, if you will, one possible world.  Another\nprofile \\(\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\) represents preferences of the same\npeople, and among the same alternatives, but in another possible world\nwhere their tastes and values are different.\nArrow\u2019s rationale for requiring aggregation procedures to handle\nmany profiles was epistemic. As he framed the question of collective\nchoice, a procedure is sought for deriving a social ordering of some\ngiven alternatives on the basis of some given people\u2019s tastes and\nvalues. It is sought, though, before it is known just what these\ntastes and values happen to be. The variety among profiles to be\nreckoned with is a measure, in Arrow\u2019s account of the matter, of how\nmuch is known or assumed about everybody\u2019s preferences a\npriori, which is to say before these have been elicited. When\nless is known, there are more profiles from which a social ordering\nmight have to be derived. When more is known, there are fewer of\nthem.\nThere are other reasons for working with many profiles, even when\npeople\u2019s actual preferences are known fully in advance. Serge Kolm (1996)\nsuggested that counterfactual preferences are relevant when we\ncome to justify the use of some given procedure.\nSensitivity analysis, used to manage uncertainty about errors in the\ninput, and to determine which information is critical in the sense\nthat the output turns on it, also requires that procedures handle a\nrange of inputs.\nWith many profiles in play there can be \u201cinterprofile\u201d\nconditions on aggregation procedures. These coordinate the results of\naggregation at several profiles at once. One such condition that plays\na crucial role in Arrow\u2019s theorem is Independence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives. It requires that whenever everybody\u2019s preferences\namong two alternatives are in one profile the same as in another, the\ncollective ordering must also be the same at the two profiles, as far\nas these alternatives are concerned. There is to be this much\nsimilarity among social orderings even as people\u2019s tastes and values\nchange. Sections 3.1\nand 4.5 discuss in more detail the meaning of\nthis controversial requirement, and the extent to which it is\nreasonable to impose it on aggregation procedures.\nIan Little raised the following objection in an early discussion\nof (Arrow 1951):\n\nIf tastes change, we may expect a new ordering of all the\nconceivable states; but we do not require that the difference between\nthe new and the old ordering should bear any particular relation to\nthe changes of taste which have occurred. We have, so to speak, a new\nworld and a new order; and we do not demand correspondence between the\nchange in the world and the change in the order (Little 1952:\n423\u2013424).\n\nLittle apparently agreed with Arrow that there might be a different\nsocial ordering were people\u2019s tastes different, but unlike Arrow he\nthought that it wouldn\u2019t have to be similar to the actual or current\nordering in any special way. Little\u2019s objection was taken to support\nthe \u201csingle profile\u201d approach to social welfare judgments\nof Abram Bergson (1938) and Paul Samuelson (1947), and there was a\ndebate about which approach was best, theirs or Arrow\u2019s.  Arguably,\nwhat was at issue in this debate was not\u2014or should not have\nbeen\u2014whether aggregation procedures must handle more than a\nsingle preference profile, but instead whether there should be any\ncoordination of the output at different profiles. Among others Sen\n(1977) and Fleurbaey and Mongin (2005) have made this point. If they\nare right then the substance of Little\u2019s objection can be accommodated\nwithin Arrow\u2019s multi-profile framework simply by not imposing any\ninterprofile constraints. Be this as it may, Arrow\u2019s framework is\nnowadays the dominant one. \n",
