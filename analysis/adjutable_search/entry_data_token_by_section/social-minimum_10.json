    "main_text": "Why a social minimum? || Relational egalitarianism\n2.5 Relational egalitarianism\n\nPosing this question is one way to draw out the importance of another\nperspective on social justice, that of relational\negalitarianism. This refers to perspectives in social philosophy\nthat give priority to the promotion of equality in power and\nstatus relations (understood, let us assume, as a demand of\njustice; see Fraser 1998, Anderson 1999). Relational egalitarians will\nbe concerned, for example, that disabled people have the capabilities\nthey need to avoid domination by others and a \u2018second class\u2019 social\nstatus. Relational egalitarian perspectives are not necessarily\nsharply distinct from egalitarian liberal perspectives, but they do\ndraw out and give more emphasis to considerations that are ignored or\nunderexplored in at least some formulations of egalitarian liberalism\n(Young 1989).\n\nOne focus of concern for the relational egalitarian is with ensuring\nthe effectiveness of citizens\u2019 political liberties. In a\npolitical democracy, all citizens have rights to vote, to campaign,\nand to stand for political office in competitive elections (Dahl\n1998). It seems likely that poverty can significantly diminish the\neffectiveness with which individuals can exercise these rights (for\nrelevant empirical research on this issue, see Krishna 2006, Mood and\nJonsson 2015). Someone who is wrapped up in the struggle for basic\nmaterial well-being might simply lack the time and energy needed to\nfocus on political issues. In addition, they will be less able to\nafford the monetary costs associated with political participation,\ne.g., paying party membership fees, making campaign contributions, and\nso on. This is bad for political democracy. It means that certain\nviewpoints and interests are not heard, so that policy becomes\nunfairly skewed against these viewpoints and interests. Hence it can\nbe argued that it is straightforwardly good for a political democracy\nto enact a social minimum. By relieving the pressure of poverty, an\nenacted social minimum will enable all citizens to participate\neffectively in the democratic process, thereby ensuring that this\nprocess is indeed genuinely\n democratic.[6]\n\nPower is not only exercised within and through the formal political\nprocess, however, but within and through a wide range of other social\nrelationships. For example, employers can exercise power over their\nemployees. Historically, husbands have often wielded great power over\nwives. These power relations can emerge in part because of\ninequalities in the economic positions between the parties (for very\nhelpful discussions, to which we are here indebted, see Goodin 1986,\n1988; Okin 1989: chapter 7). One party\u2014the employer, the\nhusband\u2014might be able to do perfectly well financially without\nthe other party. By contrast, the second party\u2014the individual\nworker, the wife\u2014might be financially reliant on the first\nparty. Were the first party to exit from the relationship, this party\nwould suffer little harm, but the second party would suffer a severe\nfall in living standards. Precisely because of this inequality in the\ncosts of exiting from the relationship, the first party has the power\nto shape the relationship on their terms. The worker or wife is not in\na position to argue with the employer\u2019s or husband\u2019s commands because\nthe employer\u2019s or husband\u2019s threat to leave the relationship unless\nobedience is forthcoming will be at once credible (since they stand to\nlose little financially from exiting it) and compelling (because the\nworker or wife stand to lose so much financially if the employer or\nhusband do go ahead and exit). Power inequalities of this kind are\nobjectionable for a number of reasons. It can be argued that they\ndirectly reduce the freedom of the less powerful parties by subjecting\nthem to \u2018domination\u2019 (Pettit 1997). They also put the less powerful\nparties at risk of exploitation and abuse by the more powerful parties\n(Goodin 1986, 1988; Okin 1989).\n\nOne important argument for the enactment of a social minimum is that\nthis can help to reduce the exit costs from such relationships for the\nparties that are otherwise vulnerable, and so reduce these\nobjectionable inequalities of power. For example, if a worker knows\nthat the community will guarantee them a decent income even if they\nquit their current job, then this makes it much easier for them to\nstand up to the boss and refuse unreasonable demands. If a wife knows\nthat the community will assist her financially if she leaves her\nhusband, then the prospect of leaving him because he abuses her\nbecomes more feasible for her. This can change the dynamic of these\nrelationships, to some extent rebalancing the power relationships\nbetween the parties.\n\nFor these reasons, then, relational egalitarian perspectives on social\njustice offer strong support for the enactment of a social minimum\n(see also Pateman 2005). Indeed, it is hard to see how any society\ncould retain relations characterised by equality of status and the\nabsence of domination for long in the absence of people having\nreasonable access to a social minimum.\n",
