Gibbard and Harper assume, to illustrate\nthe main ideas of causal decision theory, that the conditional has a\ntruth-value, and that, given its falsity, if the option were adopted,\nthen the state would not obtain. This assumption may be unwarranted if\nthe option is flipping a coin, and the relevant state is obtaining\nheads. It may be false (or indeterminate) that if the agent were to\nflip the coin, he would obtain heads. Similarly, the corresponding\nconditional about obtaining tails may be false (or indeterminate).\nThen probabilities of conditionals are not suitable for calculating\nthe option\u2019s expected utility. The relevant probabilities do not\nsum to one (or do not even exist). To circumvent such impasses, some\ntheorists calculate causally-sensitive expected utilities without\nprobabilities of subjunctive conditionals. Causal decision theory has\nmany formulations.\nBrian Skyrms (1980: Sec IIC; 1982) presented a version of causal\ndecision theory that dispenses with probabilities of subjunctive\nconditionals. His theory separates factors that the agent\u2019s act\nmay influence from factors that the agent\u2019s act may not\ninfluence. It lets \\(K_i\\) stand for a possible full specification of\nfactors that an agent may not influence and lets \\(C_j\\) stand for a\npossible (but not necessarily full) specification of factors that the\nagent may influence. The set of \\(K_i\\) forms a partition, and the set\nof \\(C_j\\) forms a partition. The formula for an act\u2019s expected\nutility first calculates its expected utility using factors the agent\nmay influence, with respect to each possible combination of factors\noutside the agent\u2019s influence. Then it computes a\nprobability-weighted average of those conditional expected\nutilities. An act\u2019s expected utility calculated this way is the\nact\u2019s \\(K\\)-expectation, \\(\\textit{EU}_k(A)\\). According to\nSkyrms\u2019s definition,\n\n\\[\\textit{EU}_k(A) = \\sum_i P(K_i)\\sum_j P(C_j \\mid K_i \\amp A)\\util (C_j\n\\amp K_i \\amp A).\\]\n\n\nSkyrms holds that an agent should select an act that maximizes\n\\(K\\)-expectation.\nLewis (1981) presented a version of causal decision theory that\ncalculates expected utility using probabilities of dependency\nhypotheses instead of probabilities of subjunctive conditionals. A\ndependency hypothesis for an agent at a time is a maximally specific\nproposition about how the things the agent cares about do and do not\ndepend causally on his present acts. An option\u2019s expected\nutility is its probability-weighted average utility with respect to a\npartition of dependency hypotheses \\(K_i\\). Lewis defines the expected\nutility of an option \\(A\\) as\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (A) = \\sum_i P(K_i)\\util (K_i \\amp A)\n\\] \n\n\nand holds that to act rationally is to realize an option that\nmaximizes expected utility. His formula for an option\u2019s expected\nutility is the same as Skyrms\u2019s assuming that \\(U(K_i \\amp A)\\)\nmay be expanded with respect to a partition of factors the agent may\ninfluence, using the formula\n\n\\[\nU(K_i \\amp A) = \\sum_j P(C_j\\mid K_i \\amp A)\\util (C_j \\amp K_i \\amp A).\n\\]\n\n\nSkyrms\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s calculations of expected utility\ndispense with causal probabilities. They build causality into states\nof the world so that causal probabilities are unnecessary. In cases\nsuch as Newcomb\u2019s problem, their calculations yield the same\nrecommendations as calculations of expected utility employing\nprobabilities of subjunctive conditionals. The various versions of\ncausal decision theory make equivalent recommendations when cases meet\ntheir background assumptions. Adam Bales (2016) compares versions in\nspecial cases that do not meet the background assumptions.\n",
