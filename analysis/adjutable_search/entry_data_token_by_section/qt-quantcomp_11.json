    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || What is Quantum in Quantum Computing?\n5.1 What is Quantum in Quantum Computing?\n\nNotwithstanding the excitement around the discovery of Shor\u2019s\nalgorithm, and putting aside the presently insurmountable problem of\npractically realising and implementing a large scale quantum computer,\na crucial theoretical question remains open: What physical resources\nare responsible for quantum computing\u2019s putative power? Put\nanother way, what are the essential features of quantum mechanics that\nwould in principle allow one to solve problems or simulate certain\nsystems more efficiently than on a classical computer? A number of\ncandidates have been put forward. Fortnow (2003) posits interference\nas the key, though it has been suggested that this is not truly a\nquantum phenomenon (Spekkens 2007). Jozsa (1997) and many others point\nto entanglement, although there are purported counter-examples to this\nthesis (see, e.g., Linden and Popescu (1999), Gottesman (1999), Biham\net al. (2004), and finally see Cuffaro (2017) for a philosophical\ndiscussion). Howard et al. (2014) appeal to quantum contextuality. For\nBub (2010) the answer lies in the logical structure of quantum\nmechanics (cf. Pitowsky 1989). Duwell (2018) argues for quantum\nparallelism, and for Deutsch (1997) and Hewitt-Horsman (2009) it is\n\u201cparallel worlds\u201d which are the resource.\n\nSpeculative as it may seem, the question \u201cwhat is\nquantum in quantum computing?\u201d has significant\npractical consequences. One of the embarrassments of quantum computing\nis the paucity of quantum algorithms which have actually been\ndiscovered. It is almost certain that one of the reasons for this is\nthe lack of a full understanding of what makes a quantum computer\nquantum (see also Preskill (1998) and Shor (2004)). As an ultimate\nanswer to this question one would like to have something similar to\nBell\u2019s famous\n theorem,\n i.e., a succinct crisp statement of the fundamental difference\nbetween quantum and classical systems. Quantum computers,\nunfortunately, do not seem to allow such a simple characterisation\n(see Cuffaro 2017, 2018a). Quantum computing skeptics (Levin 2003)\nhappily capitalise on this puzzle: If no one knows why\nquantum computers are superior to classical ones, how can we be sure\nthat they are, indeed, superior?\n5.1.1 The Debate over Parallelism and Many Worlds\n\nThe answer that has tended to dominate the popular literature on\nquantum computing is motivated by evolutions such as: \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n \\sum_{x} \\lvert x\\rangle \\lvert 0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\sum_{x}\n        \\lvert x\\rangle \\lvert f(x)\\rangle,\\]\n\n\nwhich were common to many early quantum algorithms. Note the\nappearance that \\(f\\) is evaluated for each of its possible inputs\nsimultaneously. The idea that we should take this at face\nvalue\u2014that quantum computers actually do compute a\nfunction for many different input values simultaneously\u2014is what\nDuwell (2018) calls the Quantum Parallelism Thesis\n(QPT). For Deutsch, who accepts it as true, the only reasonable\nexplanation for the QPT is that the many\nworlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics is also true. For\nDeutsch, a quantum computer in superposition, like any other quantum\nsystem, exists in some sense in many classical universes\nsimultaneously. These provide the physical arena within which the\ncomputer effects its parallel computations. This conclusion is\ndefended by Hewitt-Horsman (2009) and by Wallace (2012). Wallace\nnotes, however, that the QPT\u2014and hence the explanatory need for\nmany worlds\u2014may not be true of all or even most quantum\nalgorithms.\n\nFor Steane (2003), in contrast, quantum computers are not well\ndescribed in terms of many worlds or even quantum parallelism. Among\nother things, Steane argues that the motivation for the QPT is at\nleast partly due to misleading aspects of the standard quantum\nformalism. Additionally, comparing the information actually produced\nby quantum and classical algorithms (state collapse entails that only\none evaluation instance in (2) is ever accessible, while a classical\ncomputer must actually produce every instance) suggests that quantum\nalgorithms perform not more but fewer, cleverer, computations than\nclassical algorithms (see, also, section 5.1.2  below).\n\nAnother critic is Duwell, who (contra Steane) accepts the QPT (Duwell\n2018a), but nevertheless denies that it uniquely supports the MWI\n(Duwell 2007). Considering the phase relations between the terms in a\nsuperposition such as (2) is crucially important when evaluating a\nquantum algorithm\u2019s computational efficiency. Phase relations,\nhowever, are global properties of a state. Thus a quantum computation,\nDuwell argues, does not consist solely of local parallel\ncomputations. But in this case, the QPT does not uniquely support the\nMWI over other explanations.\n\nDefending the MWI, Hewitt-Horsman (2009) argues (contra Steane) that\nto state that quantum computers do not actually generate each of the\nevaluation instances represented in (2) is false according to the\nview: on the MWI such information could be extracted in principle\ngiven sufficiently advanced technology. Further, Hewitt-Horsman\nemphasises that the MWI is not motivated simply by a suggestive\nmathematical representation. Worlds on the MWI are defined according\nto their explanatory usefulness, manifested in particular by their\nstability and independence over the time scales relevant to the\ncomputation. Wallace (2012) argues similarly.\n\nCuffaro (2012) and Aaronson (2013b) point out that the Many Worlds\nExplanation of Quantum Computing (MWQC) and the MWI are not actually\nidentical. The latter employs\n decoherence\n as a criterion for distinguishing macroscopic worlds from one\nanother. Quantum circuit model algorithms, however, utilise\ncoherent superpositions. To distinguish computational worlds,\ntherefore, one must weaken the decoherence criterion, but Cuffaro\nargues that this move is ad hoc. Further, Cuffaro argues that the MWQC\nis for all practical purposes incompatible with\n measurement based computation,\n for even granting a weakened world identification criterion, there is\nno natural way in this model to identify worlds that are stable and\nindependent in the way required.\n5.1.2 The Elusive Nature of Speed-Up\n\nEven if we could rule out the MWQC, the problem of finding the\nphysical resource(s) responsible for quantum \u201cspeed-up\u201d\nwould remain a difficult one. Consider a solution of a decision\nproblem, say satisfiability, with a quantum algorithm based\non the circuit model. What we are given here as input is a proposition\nin the propositional calculus and we have to decide whether it has a\nsatisfying truth assignment. As Pitowsky (2002) shows, the quantum\nalgorithm appears to solve this problem by testing all \\(2^{n}\\)\nassignments \u201cat once\u201d as suggested by (2), yet this\nquantum \u2018miracle\u2019 helps us very little since, as\npreviously mentioned, any measurement performed on the output state\ncollapses it, and if there is one possible truth assignment that\nsolves this decision problem, the probability of retrieving it is\n\\(2^{-n}\\), just as in the case of a classical probabilistic Turing\nmachine which guesses the solution and then checks it.\nPitowsky\u2019s conclusion (echoed, as we saw, by Steane (2003) and\nDuwell (2007)) is that in order to enhance computation with quantum\nmechanics we must construct \u2018clever\u2019 superpositions that\nincrease the probability of successfully retrieving the result far\nmore than that of a pure guess. Shor\u2019s algorithm and the class\nof algorithms that evaluate a global property of a function\n(this class is known as the hidden subgroup class of\nalgorithms) are (so far) a unique example of both a construction of\nsuch \u2018clever\u2019 superpositions and a retrieval of the\nsolution in polynomial time. The quantum adiabatic algorithm may give\nus similar results, contingent upon the existence of an energy gap\nthat decreases polynomially with the input.\n\nThis question also raises important issues about how to measure the\ncomplexity of a given quantum algorithm. The answer differs, of\ncourse, according to the particular model at hand. In the adiabatic\nmodel, for example, one needs only to estimate the energy gap\nbehaviour and its relation to the input size (encoded in the number of\ndegrees of freedom of the Hamiltonian of the system). In the\nmeasurement-based model, one counts the number of measurements needed\nto reveal the solution that is hidden in the input cluster state\n(since the preparation of the cluster state is a polynomial process,\nit does not add to the complexity of the computation). But in the\ncircuit model things are not as straightforward. After all, the whole\nof the quantum-circuit-based computation can be be simply represented\nas a single unitary transformation from the input state to\nthe output state.\n\nThis feature of the quantum circuit model supports the conjecture that\nthe power of quantum computers, if any, lies not in quantum dynamics\n(i.e., in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation), but rather in the quantum\nstate, or the wave function. Another argument in favour of this\nconjecture is that the Hilbert subspace \u201cvisited\u201d during a\nquantum computational process is, at any moment, a linear space\nspanned by all of the vectors in the total Hilbert space which have\nbeen created by the computational process up to that moment. But this\nHilbert subspace is thus a subspace spanned by a polynomial number of\nvectors and is thus at most a polynomial subspace of the total Hilbert\nspace. A classical simulation of the quantum evolution on a Hilbert\nspace with polynomial number of dimensions (that is, a Hilbert space\nspanned by a number of basis vectors which is polynomial in the number\nof qubits involved in the computation), however, can be carried out in\na polynomial number of classical computations. Were quantum\ndynamics the sole ingredient responsible to the efficiency of\nquantum computing, the latter could be mimicked in a polynomial number\nof steps with a classical computer (see, e.g. Vidal 2003).\n\nThis is not to say that quantum computation is no more powerful than\nclassical computation. The key point, of course, is that one does not\nend a quantum computation with an arbitrary superposition, but aims\nfor a very special, \u2018clever\u2019 state\u2014to use\nPitowsky\u2019s term. Quantum computations may not always be\nmimicked with a classical computer because the characterisation of the\ncomputational subspace of certain quantum states is difficult, and it\nseems that these special, \u2018clever\u2019, quantum states cannot\nbe classically represented as vectors derivable via a quantum\ncomputation in an optimal basis, or at least that one cannot do so in\nsuch way that would allow one to calculate the outcome of the final\nmeasurement made on these states.\n\nConsequently, in the quantum circuit model one should count the number\nof computational steps in the computation not by counting the number\nof transformations of the state, but by counting the number of one- or\ntwo-qubit local transformations that are required to create the\n\u2018clever\u2019 superposition that ensures the desired\n\u201cspeed-up\u201d. (Note that Shor\u2019s algorithm, for\nexample, involves three major steps in this context: First, one\ncreates the \u2018clever\u2019 entangled state with a set of unitary\ntransformations. The result of the computation\u2014a global property\nof a function\u2014is now \u2018hidden\u2019 in this state; second,\nin order to retrieve this result, one projects it on a subspace of the\nHilbert space, and finally one performs another set of unitary\ntransformations in order to make the result measurable in the original\ncomputational basis. All these steps count as\ncomputational steps as far as the efficiency of the algorithm\nis concerned. See also Bub (2006b).) The trick is to perform these\nlocal one- or two-qubit transformations in polynomial time, and it is\nlikely that it is here where the physical power of quantum computing\nmay be found.\n",
