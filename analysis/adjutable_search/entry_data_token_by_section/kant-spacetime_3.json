    "main_text": "The \u201cMetaphysical Exposition\u201d || What is a metaphysical exposition?\n3.1 What is a metaphysical exposition?\n\nWhat Kant calls the Metaphysical Exposition of the Concept of Space\npresents the first arguments of the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant\ndefines the \u201cexposition\u201d of a concept as follows:\n\u201cBy an exposition (expositio) I understand the clear\n(if it is not explicit) representation of what belongs to a concept;\nit is metaphysical if it contains what the concept presents as a\npriori given\u201d (A23/B38). By a concept (Begriff) in\nthis context I take Kant simply to mean a\n representation.[8]\n So his goal is to characterize the content of the representation of\n space. For Kant, an \u201cexposition\u201d is different from a definition: he\n is not undertaking a definition of space, the word\n \u2018space,\u2019 or the concept <space> (for helpful\n discussion, see Dunlop 2012). In this regard, Kant follows a long\n tradition emanating from Newton\u2019s Scholium following the\n Definitions in the\nPrincipia, where Newton explains that space, time and motion\nare familiar to everyone and therefore will not be defined in his\nwork, unlike unfamiliar technical concepts like mass or\nimpressed force, which are defined (Newton 1999, 408). Unlike\nNewton, however, Kant focuses primarily on our representation of\nspace, rather than on space itself. That seems to be expressed by his\nnotion of an exposition.\n",
