    "main_text": "Republican Liberty: Problems and Debates || What about non-interference?\n2.1 What about non-interference?\n\nA common objection to the republican idea of freedom is that it fails\nto pick out an distinct conception at all. The suggestion here, first\nnoted perhaps by Paley (1785), is that talking about non-domination is\nreally just another (more obscure) way of talking about security of\nnon-interference (Goodin 2003; Carter 2008; Kramer 2008). Contemporary\ncivic republicans must reject this view. Pettit (1997, 73\u20134)\nobserves that one might secure a low expected level of\nnon-interference in more than one way, and the republican idea of\nfreedom is by no means indifferent as to the method adopted. For\nexample, to have a master with an exceptionally benevolent disposition\nis to be reasonably secure in one\u2019s expectation that one will\nnot often be adversely interfered with\u2014but it is to have a\nmaster nonetheless. The republican idea of freedom specifically\ninstructs us not to make our master a better person (the goal of the\nold \u2018mirror for princes\u2019 literature), but to render him\nless of a master (Lovett 2012b). This can only be done by curbing\neither his arbitrary power or his subjects\u2019 dependency on\nhim.\n\nSupposing then that non-domination and non-interference are indeed\ndistinct ideas, one might wonder where this leaves the latter, on the\ncivic republican view of things. Is obtaining freedom from arbitrary\npower the only thing we should care about? Roughly speaking,\nthere are three possible answers civic republicans might give to this\nquestion.\n\nThe first is simply to answer yes. It was a mistake, one\nmight argue, to ever think non-interference important or desirable in\nitself. Of course, as a contingent empirical fact, extensive arbitrary\npower often brings extensive interferences in train (slave masters and\nabsolute monarchs just can\u2019t help meddling in their\nsubjects\u2019 affairs, we might suppose), so it is understandable\nthat our distaste for the former should influence our assessment of\nthe latter. There are good reasons for rejecting this first answer,\nhowever. Imagine living in a community where our lives are regulated\ndown to the tiniest detail, but always in strict accordance with\ncommonly-known, non-arbitrary rules and procedures. Although we enjoy\nextensive freedom from arbitrary power, we have hardly any freedom of\nindividual choice. Most would not want to live in such a community,\nand this suggests that we do indeed place some independent value on\nnon-interference (Larmore 2001; Wall 2001).\n\nThis leaves two other possible answers. On the one hand, we might try\nto incorporate some measure of non-interference into our idea of\nfreedom as non-domination. Something like this approach was initially\ntaken by Pettit (1997, 74\u20137): there he distinguished between\nfactors that \u201ccompromise\u201d liberty, and factors that\n\u201ccondition\u201d it. Perhaps my republican freedom is\ncompromised when someone gains arbitrary power over me, but it is\nmerely conditioned when I lack the means or opportunities to make full\nuse of it, and interferences might be one such conditioning factor. On\nthe other hand, we might allow that republican freedom and\nnon-interference are distinct goods, but hold that both are valuable\nin some degree. We might either regard them as having roughly equal\nvalue (Skinner 1998), or we might regard republican liberty as having\ngreater importance than non-interference, other things equal (Viroli\n2002, Pettit 2012). Each of these options has its advantages and\ndisadvantages, and there is no settled view in the contemporary civic\nrepublican literature on this point (see Lovett 2018).\u00a0\n",
