    "main_text": "The Good Democrat\n2. The Good Democrat\n\nCivic education can occur in all kinds of regimes, but it is\nespecially important in democracies. In The Politics, Aristotle\nasks whether there is any case \u201cin which the excellence of the\ngood citizen and the excellence of the good man coincide\u201d\n(1277a13\u201315). The answer for him is a politea or a mixed\nconstitution in which persons must know both how to rule and how to\nobey. In such regimes, the excellence and virtues of the good man and\nthe good citizen coincide. Democratic societies have an interest in\npreparing citizens to rule and to be ruled. \n\nModern democracies, however, are different from the ancient polis in\nseveral important and pertinent respects. They are mass societies in\nwhich most people can have little individual impact on government and\npolicy. They are complex, technologically-driven, highly specialized\nsocieties in which professionals (including lawyers, civil servants,\nand politicians) have much more expertise than laypeople. And they are\nliberal constitutional regimes in which individual freedom is\nprotected--to various degrees--and government is deliberately\ninsulated from public pressure. For example, courts and central banks\nare protected from popular votes. Once the United States had become an\nindustrialized mass society, the influential columnist Walter Lippmann\nargued that ordinary citizens had been eclipsed and could, at most,\nrender occasional judgments about a government of experts (see The\nPhantom Public, 1925). John Dewey and the Chicago civic leader\nJane Addams (in different ways) asserted that the lay public must and\ncould regain its voice, but they struggled to explain how.\n",
