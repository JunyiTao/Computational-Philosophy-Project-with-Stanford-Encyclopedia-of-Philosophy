    "main_text": "Contemporary Eliminative Materialism || Eliminative Theory Change\n2.2 Eliminative Theory Change\n\nThe second component of eliminative materialism is the thesis that\nfolk psychology is profoundly wrong about the actual nature of the\nmind/brain. Eliminative materialists argue that the central tenets of\nfolk psychology radically misdescribe cognitive processes;\nconsequently, the posits of folk psychology have no role to play in a\nserious scientific theory of the mind because the posits pick out\nnothing that is real. Like dualists, eliminative materialists insist\nthat ordinary mental states cannot be reduced to or identified with\nneurological events or processes. However, unlike dualists,\nstraightforward eliminativists claim there is nothing more to the mind\nthan what occurs in the brain. The reason mental states are\nirreducible is not because they are non-physical; rather, it is\nbecause mental states, as described by common-sense psychology, do not\nreally exist. \n\nTo see all of this a little better, it will help to return to the\nimportant distinction made by Steven Savitt discussed in Section 1\nbetween ontologically conservative (or retentive) theory change on the\none hand, and ontologically radical (or eliminative) theory change on\nthe other hand. Ontologically conservative theory change occurs when\nthe entities and posits of the replaced theory are relocated, often\nwith some degree of revision, in the replacing theory. For example, as\nour theory of light was gradually replaced by our understanding of\nelectro-magnetic radiation, our conception of light was dramatically\ntransformed as we recognized ways in which our old conception was\nmistaken or incomplete. Nevertheless, at no point did we come to say\nthat there is really no such thing as light. Rather, light was\neventually identified with a form of electro-magnetic radiation.\n\nBy contrast, our notion of demons did not come to find a new home in\ncontemporary theories of mental disorder. There is nothing in the\ntheories of schizophrenia, Tourette\u2019s Syndrome, neuro-pathology\nor any of the other modern explanations for bizarre behavior, that we\ncan sensibly identify with malevolent spirits with supernatural\npowers. The notion of a demon is just too far removed from anything we\nnow posit to explain behavior that was once explained by demonology.\nConsequently, the transition from demonology to modern accounts of\nthis behavior was ontologically radical. We dropped demons from our\ncurrent ontology, and came to realize that the notion is\nempty\u2014it refers to nothing real. \n\nEliminative materialists claim that an ontologically radical theory\nchange awaits the theoretical posits of folk psychology in a manner\nsimilar to these cases. With straightforward eliminativism, just as we\ncame to understand that there are no such things as demons (because\nnothing at all like demons appear in modern accounts of strange\nbehavior), so too, eliminative materialists argue that various folk\npsychological concepts\u2014like our concept of belief\u2014will\neventually be recognized as empty posits that fail to correspond with\nanything that actually exists. Since there is nothing that has the\ncausal and semantic properties we attribute to beliefs (and many other\nmental states) it will turn out that there really are no such\nthings. \n\nIt should be noted that a somewhat similar framework for understanding\neliminative materialism is provided by David Lewis\u2019s discussion\nof functional definitions in psychology (1972) (see the entry on\n functionalism).\n In Lewis\u2019s account, our commonsense mental notions can be\ntreated as functionally defined theoretical terms that appear in a\nchain of Ramsey-sentences. The Ramsey-sentences are a formal\nreconstruction of the platitudes of commonsense psychology. They\nprovide a set of roles or conditions that more or less must be met for\nthe instantiation of any given state. If nothing comes close to\nactually filling the roles specified by this framework for a certain\nstate, then we are warranted in saying that the theoretical posit in\nquestion doesn\u2019t refer and there is no such thing. Eliminative\nmaterialists claim that this is precisely what will happen with at\nleast some of our folk mental notions.\n",
