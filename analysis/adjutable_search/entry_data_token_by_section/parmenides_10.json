    "main_text": "Some Principal Types of Interpretation || The Aspectual Interpretation Prevailing in Antiquity\n3.5 The Modal Interpretation\n\nNumerous interpreters have variously resisted the idea that Parmenides\nmeant to deny the very existence of the world we experience. They have\nconsequently advocated some more robust status for the cosmological\nportion of his poem. (See, e.g., Minar 1949, Woodbury 1958, Chalmers\n1960, Clark 1969, Owens 1974, Robinson 1979, de Rijk 1983, and\nFinkelberg 1986, 1988, and 1999, and Hussey 1990.) Unfortunately, too\nmany interpretations of this type deploy the terms\n\u201creality,\u201d \u201cphenomena,\u201d and\n\u201cappearance\u201d so ambiguously that it can be difficult to\ntell whether they intend to attribute an objective or merely some\nsubjective existence to the inhabitants of the\n\u201cphenomenal\u201d world. More positively, a number of these\ninterpreters have recognized the important point that the two parts of\nthe goddess\u2019 revelation are presented as having different\nepistemic status. (See also the proposal at Kahn 1969, 710 and n. 13,\nto identify Parmenides\u2019 subject in the Way of Conviction as\n\u201cthe object of knowing, what is or can be known.\u201d) They\nhave nonetheless failed to take proper account of the modal\ndistinctions that define Parmenides\u2019 presentation of the ways of\ninquiry. In this omission they are not alone, of course, since none of\nthe types of interpretation reviewed so far recognizes that Parmenides\nwas the first philosopher rigorously to distinguish what must be, what\nmust not be, and what is but need not be.\n\nIn the crucial fragment 2, the goddess says she will describe for\nParmenides \u201cwhich ways of inquiry alone there are for\nunderstanding\u201d (fr. 2.2). The common construal of this phrase as\ntantamount to the only conceivable ways of inquiry has been\none of the principal spurs for readings according to which only two,\nnot three, paths feature in the poem, for it is natural to wonder how\nthe goddess can present fragment 2\u2019s two paths as the only\nconceivable paths of inquiry and nonetheless in fragment 6 present\nstill another path, that along which mortals are said to wander.\nTwo-path interpretations respond to this apparent difficulty by\nidentifying the path of mortal inquiry with fragment 2\u2019s second\npath (though implausibly so, as noted above, sect. 2.2).\nParmenides\u2019 goddess in fact has good reason to distinguish the\ntwo ways of inquiry presented in fragment 2 from the way subsequently\npresented in fragment 6. The two ways of fragment 2, unlike the third\nway, are marked as ways \u201cfor understanding,\u201d that is, for\nachieving the kind of understanding that contrasts with the\n\u201cwandering understanding\u201d the goddess later says is\ncharacteristic of mortals. The use of the Greek datival infinitive in\nthe phrase, \u201cthere are for understanding\u201d (eisi\nno\u00easai, fr. 2.2b; cf. Empedocles fr. 3.12 for the identical\nconstruction) distinguishes the two ways introduced in this fragment\nfrom the one subsequently introduced in fragment 6, as ways\nfor understanding. That the goal is specifically\nunderstanding that does not wander becomes clear when she\nsubsequently presents the third way as one followed by \u201cmortals\nwho know nothing\u201d (fr. 6.4), which leads to \u201cwandering\nunderstanding\u201d (plagkton n\u00f6on, fr. 6.6).\nComparison with fr. 8.34\u20136a\u2019s retrospective indication\nthat \u201cunderstanding\u201d (no\u00eama, to\nnoein), by which is apparently meant trustworthy thought (cf. fr.\n8.50), has itself been a major goal of the inquiry suggests that a way\nfor understanding is one along which this goal of attaining\ntrustworthy understanding might be achieved.\n\nThe two ways of inquiry that lead to thought that does not wander are:\n\u201cthat [it] is and that [it] is not not to be\u201d (fr.\n2.3)\u2014i.e., \u201cthat [it] is and that [it] cannot not\nbe\u201d\u2014and \u201cthat [it] is not and that [it] must not\nbe\u201d (fr. 2.5). Each verse appears to demarcate a distinct\nmodality or way of being. One might find it natural to call these\nmodalities, respectively, the modality of necessary being and the\nmodality of necessary non-being or impossibility. Parmenides conceives\nof these modalities as ways of being or ways an entity might be rather\nthan as logical properties. If one respects the organizing metaphor of\nthe ways of inquiry, one can, even at this stage of the goddess\u2019\nrevelation, appreciate what it means for \u201cthat [it] is and that\n[it] cannot not be\u201d to define a way of inquiry. This\nspecification indicates that what Parmenides is looking for is what is\nand cannot not be\u2014or, more simply, what must be. Pursuing this\nway of inquiry requires maintaining a constant focus on the modality\nof the object of his search as he tries to attain a fuller conception\nof what an entity that is and cannot not be, or that must be, must be\nlike. To remain on this path Parmenides must resolutely reject any\nconception of the object of his search that proves incompatible with\nits mode of being, as the goddess reminds him at numerous points.\n\nWhat one looks for along this path of inquiry is what is and cannot\nnot be, or, more simply, what must be. It is therefore appropriate to\nthink of the first path as the path of necessary being and of what\nlies along it as what is (what it is) necessarily. What is and cannot\nnot be will be whatever is (what it is) actually throughout the\nhistory of this world. Likewise, what is not and must not be will be\nwhatever is not (anything) actually at any moment in the world\u2019s\nhistory. There are of course other ways for things to be, but not,\naccording to Parmenides, other ways for things to be such that\napprehension of them will figure as understanding that does not\nwander. The second way is introduced alongside the first because the\nmodality of necessary non-being or impossibility specified in fr. 2.5\nis just as constant and invariable as the modality of necessary being\nspecified in fr. 2.3. Whatever thought there may be about what lies\nalong this second way will be unwavering and, as such, will contrast\nwith the wandering thought typical of mortals. Even if the effort to\nthink about what lies along the second way ends (as it does) in a\ntotal failure of apprehension, this non-apprehension remains\nunwavering. Inquiry along the second way involves, first, keeping in\nmind that what one is looking for is not and must not be, and thereby\ntrying to discover what an entity that is in this way must be like. It\nis immediately evident, though, what an entity that is not and must\nnot be is like: nothing at all. The goddess warns Parmenides not to\nset out on the second way because there is no prospect of finding or\nforming any conception of what must not be. She thus tells Parmenides\nat fr. 2.6 that this is a path where nothing at all can be learned by\ninquiry.\n\nPaying proper attention to the modal clauses in the goddess\u2019\nspecification of the first two ways of inquiry enables us to\nunderstand the last two verses of fragment 2 as making a sound\nphilosophical point. She says, again, at fr. 2.7\u20138:\n\u201cneither could you apprehend what is not, for it is not to be\naccomplished,/ nor could you indicate it.\u201d Here she is warning\nParmenides against proceeding along the second way, and it should be\nclear that \u201cwhat is not\u201d (to m\u00ea eon) is the\ngoddess\u2019 way of referring to what is in the manner specified\njust two verses above: \u201cthat [it] is not and that [it] must not\nbe\u201d (fr. 2.5). She declares that Parmenides could neither know\nnor indicate \u201cwhat is not\u201d by way of explaining her\nassertion in the preceding verse that the second way is a way wholly\nwithout report. Thus here \u201cwhat is not\u201d (to m\u00ea\neon) serves as shorthand for \u201cwhat is not and must not\nbe.\u201d (Given the awkwardness of having to deploy the phrase\n\u201cwhat is not and must not be\u201d whenever referring to what\nenjoys the second way\u2019s mode of being, one would expect\nParmenides to have employed such a device even if he had written in\nprose.) One cannot, in fact, form any definite conception of what is\nnot and must not be, and a fortiori one cannot indicate it in\nany way. (Try to picture a round square, or to point one out to\nsomeone else.) Parmenides has not fallen prey here to the purportedly\nparadoxical character of negative existential statements but makes a\nperfectly acceptable point about the inconceivability of what\nnecessarily is not. Any philosopher with an interest in the relation\nbetween conceivability and possibility should be prepared to recognize\nin Parmenides\u2019 assertion that you could neither apprehend nor\nindicate what is not (and must not be) one of the earliest instances\nof a form of inference\u2014that from inconceivability to\nimpossibility\u2014that continues to occupy a central position in\nmetaphysical reasoning.\n\nBefore undertaking to guide Parmenides toward a fuller conception of\nwhat is and cannot not be, the goddess properly warns him away from a\nthird possible path of inquiry in fragments 6 and 7, while at the same\ntime reminding him of the imperative to think of what is in the manner\nspecified in fr. 2.3 only as being (what it is). Fragment 6 begins\nwith the goddess instructing Parmenides that it is necessary to say\nand think that \u201cWhat Is\u201d (to eon) is,\nand that he is not to think of it as not being. (Here to eon\nfunctions as a shorthand designation for what is in the way specified\nin fr. 2.3, that is, what is and cannot not be, paralleling fr.\n2.7\u2019s use of to m\u00ea eon or \u201cwhat is\nnot\u201d as shorthand for what is in the way specified in fr. 2.5,\nthat is, what is not and must not be.) This is her essential directive\nto Parmenides regarding how to pursue the first path of inquiry. The\ngoddess also indicates in this fragment that the second major phase of\nher revelation will proceed along the path typically pursued by\nmortals whose reliance upon sensation has yielded only wandering\nunderstanding. She provides what amounts to a modal specification of\nthis path of inquiry when she describes mortals as supposing\n\u201cthat it is and is not the same/ and not the same\u201d (fr.\n6.8\u20139a). The sense of this difficult clause seems to be that\nmortals mistakenly suppose that an object of genuine understanding may\nbe subject to the variableness implicit in their conception of it as\nbeing and not being the same, and being and not being not the same.\nThis is not to say that the things upon which ordinary humans have\nexclusively focused their attention, because of their reliance upon\nsensation, do not exist. It is merely to say that they do not\nenjoy the mode of necessary being required of an object of unwandering\nunderstanding. The imagery in fr. 6.4\u20137 that paints mortals as\nwandering blind and helpless portrays them as having failed entirely\nto realize that there is something that must be that is available for\nthem to apprehend if only they could awaken from their stupor. Even\nso, the goddess does not say that mortals have no apprehension.\nUnderstanding that wanders is still understanding.\n\nThe goddess reveals to Parmenides, however, the possibility of\nachieving understanding that does not wander or that is stable and\nunchanging, precisely because its object is and cannot not be (what it\nis). The third way of inquiry can never lead to this, and thus it is\nnot presented by the goddess as a path of inquiry for understanding.\nIt directs the inquirer\u2019s attention to things that are (what\nthey are) only contingently or temporarily: they are and then again\nare not, or they are a certain way and then again are not that way.\nThe problem with this path is not, as too many interpreters have\nunderstood it to be, that nothing exists to be discovered\nalong this way. There are innumerably many things that are (and exist)\nin the manner specified at fr. 6.8\u20139a (and fr. 8.40\u20131).\nHowever, since their being is merely contingent, Parmenides thinks\nthere can be no stable apprehension of them, no thoughts about them\nthat remain steadfast and do not wander, and thus no true or reliable\nconviction. According to Parmenides, genuine conviction cannot be\nfound by focusing one\u2019s attention on things that are subject to\nchange. This is why he has the goddess repeatedly characterize the\ncosmology in the second phase of her revelation as deceptive or\nuntrustworthy. The modal interpretation thus makes it relatively\nstraightforward to understand the presence of the poem\u2019s\ncosmology. It is an account of the principles, origins, and operation\nof the world\u2019s mutable population. It is Parmenides\u2019 own\naccount, the best he was able to provide, and one firmly in the\ntradition of Presocratic cosmology. At the same time, however,\nParmenides supposed there was more to the world than all those things\nthat have grown, now are, and will hereafter end (as he describes them\nin fragment 19). There is also what is (what it is) and cannot not be\n(what it is).\n\nThe first major phase of the goddess\u2019 revelation in fragment 8\nis, on the modal interpretation, a meditation on the nature of what\nmust be. The goddess leads Parmenides to form a conception of the\nattributes whatever must be has to possess just in virtue of its mode\nof being. If one appreciates that Parmenides is concerned with\ndetermining what can be inferred about the nature or character of What\nIs simply from its mode of being, one can see that he is in fact\nentitled to the inferences he draws in the major deductions of\nfragment 8. Certainly what must be cannot have come to be, nor can it\ncease to be. Both possibilities are incompatible with its mode of\nbeing. Likewise, what must be cannot change in any respect, for this\nwould involve its not being what it is, which is also incompatible\nwith its mode of being, since what must be must be what it is. On the\nassumption, inevitable at the time, that it is a spatially extended or\nphysical entity, certain other attributes can also be inferred. What\nmust be must be free from any internal variation. Such variation would\ninvolve its being something or having a certain character in some\nplace(s) while being something else or having another character in\nothers, which is incompatible with the necessity of its (all) being\nwhat it is. For much the same reason, it must be free from variation\nat its extremity. Since the only solid that is uniform at its\nextremity is a sphere, what must be must be spherical.\n\nIt is difficult to see what more Parmenides could have inferred as to\nthe character of what must be simply on the basis of its modality as a\nnecessary being. In fact, the attributes of the main program have an\nunderlying systematic character suggesting they are meant to exhaust\nthe logical possibilities: What Is both must be (or exist), and it\nmust be what it is, not only temporally but also spatially. For What\nIs to be (or exist) across times is for it to be ungenerated and\ndeathless; and for it to be what it is across times is for it\nto be \u201cstill\u201d or unchanging. For What Is to be (or exist)\neverywhere is for it to be whole. For it to be what it is at\nevery place internally is for it to be uniform; and to be so\neverywhere at its extremity is for it to be \u201cperfect\u201d or\n\u201ccomplete.\u201d Taken together, the attributes shown to belong\nto what must be amount to a set of perfections: everlasting existence,\nimmutability, the internal invariances of wholeness and uniformity,\nand the invariance at its extremity of being optimally shaped. What Is\nhas thus proven to be not only a necessary but, in many ways, a\nperfect entity.\n\nOn the modal interpretation, Parmenides may be counted a\n\u201cgenerous\u201d monist. While he reasons that there is only one\nentity that must be, he also sees that there are manifold entities\nthat are but need not be (what they are). Parmenides was a\n\u201cgenerous\u201d monist because the existence of what must be\ndoes not preclude the existence of all the things that are but need\nnot be. There are at least two options for envisaging how this is\nsupposed to be the case. Some who have understood Parmenides as a\ngenerous monist have adopted a view similar to Aristotle\u2019s. In\nMetaphysics 1.5, Aristotle remarks that Parmenides seems to\nhave had a conception of formal unity (986b18\u201319),\nand he gives a compressed account of the reasoning by which he takes\nParmenides to have arrived at such a conception\n(986b27\u201331). Then, as already noted, he adds the\ncomment that Parmenides, being compelled to go with the phenomena, and\nsupposing that what is is one with respect to the account (sc. of\nits essence) but plural with respect to perception, posited a\nduality of principles as the basis for his account of the phenomena\n(986b27\u201334). Thus, for Aristotle, Parmenides held\nthat what is is one, in a strong and strict sense, but it is\nalso many (in and for perception). A number of modern interpreters\nhave also advocated some form of what amounts to the ancient\n\u201caspectual\u201d view of the relation between the two phases of\nthe goddess\u2019 revelation. (See Owens 1974 and Finkelberg 1999,\nwho explicitly position their views as heirs to that at Arist.\nMetaph. 1.5.986b27\u201334.) Parmenides would\ncertainly have been a generous monist if he envisioned What Is as\nconsubstantial with the cosmos\u2019s perceptible and mutable\npopulation. But an apparently insurmountable difficulty for this\nresponse comes in the suggestive verses of fr. 4: \u201cbut behold\nthings that, while absent, are steadfastly present to thought:/ for\nyou will not cut off What Is from holding fast to What Is,/ neither\ndispersing everywhere every way in a world-order (kata\nkosmon)/ nor drawing together.\u201d\n\nIt thus seems preferable to understand What Is as coterminous but not\nconsubstantial with the perceptible cosmos: it is in exactly the same\nplace where the perceptible cosmos is, but is a separate and distinct\n\u201csubstance.\u201d (Note the parallels between fr. 8.30b-31 and\nfr. 10.5-7, as well as between fr. 8.24 and fr. 9.3.) On this view,\nWhat Is imperceptibly interpenetrates or runs through all things while\nyet maintaining its own identity distinct from theirs. Something like\nthis seems to be how Anaxagoras envisioned the relation between Mind\nand the rest of the world\u2019s things: Mind, he says, \u201cis now\nwhere also all the others are, in that which surrounds many things and\nin those which have accreted and in those which have separated\nout\u201d (Anaxag. fr. 14). Parmenides\u2019 vision of the relation\nbetween What Is and the developed cosmos, as coterminous but not\nconsubstantial, also has its analogue in Xenophanes\u2019 conception\nof the relation between his one greatest god and the cosmos, as well\nas in Empedocles\u2019 conception of the divinity that is the\npersistent aspect of the cosmos\u2019 perfectly unified condition,\ndarting throughout the cosmos with its swift thought. Both appear to\nbe coterminous but not consubstantial with the cosmos they\npenetrate.\n\nAlthough What Is in Parmenides has its nearest analogue in these\ndivine principles, Parmenides himself never in the extant fragments\ncalls What Is divine or otherwise suggests that it is a god. Instead,\nhe develops an exhaustive conception of the attributes what must be\nhas to possess, by systematically pursuing the fundamental idea that\nwhat must be both must be or exist, and must be what it is, not only\ntemporally but also spatially. Whatever other attributes it might have\nthat cannot be understood to belong to it in one of these ways do not\nenter into Parmenides\u2019 conception of What Is. Thus it has none\nof the features of the religious tradition\u2019s heavenly gods that\npersist as attributes of Xenophanes\u2019 greatest god, despite\nresembling it in other respects. If Xenophanes can be seen as a\nfounder of rational theology, then Parmenides\u2019 distinction among\nthe principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that\nmust belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as\nthe founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct\nfrom theology.\n",
