Opposed to this\nview are holists who claim that whether a consideration like pleasure\nis relevant and whether it counts in favor of an action depends on\nwhat other factors may be present in some set of circumstances.\nHolists claim that in some circumstances a factor that is normally\nrelevant is \u201csilenced\u201d and moreover even when relevant its\nvalence may be reversed! Although pleasure tends to have a positive\nvalence, the pleasure a bully would derive from bullying someone has a\nnegative valence, which contributes to the wrongness of the\nbully\u2019s act.\n\nMandelbaum used the example from the previous section (his example) to\nargue against Rossian atomism (although the atomism/holism terminology\nhad not yet been introduced as labels for the pertinent distinction).\nAs we explained, if Ross\u2019s atomistic view is correct, the fact\nthat one has a chance to express gratitude is a morally relevant\nconsideration that favors lying about your co-worker\u2019s\ncompetence. In not acting on this consideration, one ought to feel\nsome remorse (having failed to comply with a prima facie\nduty), remorse being a proper reaction to wrongness. However, if, upon\ncontemplating this scenario and projecting into it, one imagines\nexperiencing regret at being in this difficult situation, but not\nremorse, this signifies that one takes considerations of gratitude to\nbe irrelevant in deciding what to do in this case. Mandelbaum\nargues that \u201cthe essential aspect of the situation\u201d (1955:\n78) is that one has been asked a legitimate question, and the person\nasking it is either unaware of one\u2019s personal tie with the\nco-worker or expects one to put it aside in answering the question.\nViewed this way, considerations of gratitude are not relevant in the\nsituation one confronts. Mandelbaum further reports that he imagines\nfeeling regret at being in such a situation, but not remorse for\ntelling the truth.\n\nThus, while the experiential difference between regret, whose object\nis one\u2019s circumstances, and remorse, whose object is one\u2019s\naction (or omission), is used in defense of pluralism over monism\nregarding the fundamental right- and wrong-making features of actions,\nthis same contrast has been marshaled in defense of holism over\natomism about the relevance and valence of such features.\n",
