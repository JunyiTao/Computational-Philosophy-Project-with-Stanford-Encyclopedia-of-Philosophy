    "main_text": "\n\nScientific theories seem to have an expiry date. If we look at the\nhistory of science, a number of theories that once were dominant and\nwidely accepted are currently taught in history of science courses.\nWill this be the fate of current scientific theories? Is there a\npattern of radical theory-change as science grows? Are theories\nabandoned en bloc? Or are there patterns of retention in\ntheory-change? That is, are some parts of theories more likely to\nsurvive than other parts? And what are the implications of all this\nfor the scientific image of the world?\n\nThese kinds of question have played a major role in the scientific\nrealism debate. The challenge to scientific realism is supposed to\ncome directly from the history of science. The history of science, it\nis claimed, is at odds with scientific realism\u2019s epistemic\noptimism. It is full of theories which were shown to be false and\nabandoned, despite their empirical successes. Hence, it is claimed,\nrealists cannot be warrantedly optimistic about the (approximate)\ntruth of currently empirically successful theories. If we take the\nhistorical evidence seriously, it is claimed, current theories too\nwill, sooner or later, be abandoned and take their place in future\nhistory-of-science courses. This anti-realist line of argument has\nbecome known as \u2018the pessimistic induction\u2019 (aka\npessimistic meta-induction)\u2014henceforth PI. Without\ndenying that theories change over time, scientific realists have tried\nto block this line of argument by showing either that it is fallacious\nor that there is substantive continuity in theory-change which\nwarrants the realist\u2019s optimism that current science is on the\nright track.\n\nThis entry discusses the origin and current state of the historical\nchallenge to realism and the various realist reactions to it. The\nfirst part focuses on the first enactment of arguments based on\nhistorical pessimism, as these appeared in the so-called\n\u2018bankruptcy of science controversy\u2019 in the end of the\nnineteenth century.\n\nThe second part deals with the historical challenge to scientific\nrealism as this is currently formulated and the various lines of\ndefense of the claim that scientific knowledge grows despite\ntheory-change.\n",
