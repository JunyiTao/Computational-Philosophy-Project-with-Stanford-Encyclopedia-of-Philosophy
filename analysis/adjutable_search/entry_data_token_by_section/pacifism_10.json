Thus pacifism is usually derived\nby negation. Pacifism, primarily, tells us what not to do. As Cheyney\nRyan has argued, pacifism is a \u201cskeptical position.\u201d As\nRyan puts this: \u201cits general claim is that the proponent of\nkilling cannot produce a single compelling argument for why killing\nanother person is permissible\u201d (Ryan 1983, 509). One of the\nskeptical problems that Ryan addresses is the problem that occurs in\nkilling in self-defense. When a Victim kills an Aggressor in\nself-defense, this killing occurs before the Aggressor has actualized\nhis malicious intention. In this case, killing in self-defense is out\nof proportion to the harm done, since the Victim who kills in\nself-defense was not himself killed. A skeptical version of pacifism\ncan thus develop from the worry that when we choose to kill in\nself-defense, we never know whether this killing is in fact\njustifiable.\n\nThis sort of skeptical position can be linked to the just war\ntradition\u2019s concern with the question of \u201clast\nresort\u201d in thinking about jus ad bellum. Skeptical\npacifists wonder how we would know that we ever reach the stage of\nlast resort, when violence becomes necessary. One way that pacifists\narticulate this concern is to focus on the variety of nonviolent\nmeasures that could be employed before it becomes necessary to resort\nto force. Indeed, it may be argued that to resort to violence is to\nadmit to a failure of imagination and to give up hope that more humane\nforms of problem solving and conflict resolution can be effective.\nMoreover, pacifists will note that it is not sufficient to try\nnonviolent methods once and then disregard them. Rather, one must\nengage in a variety of nonviolent actions; and one must try these\nnonviolent alternatives more than once.\n\nA somewhat different version of skeptical pacifism can be found in\ncritiques of militarism and the ideology and propaganda that lead\npeople to support war. This skeptical stance has been defended by\nFiala (Fiala 2008 and 2010). In this approach, skepticism produces a\npractical political pacifism that is based upon the fact that citizens\nhave no good reason to trust that their governments are telling them\nthe truth about war and its justification. This skepticism is derived\nfrom historical judgments about the tendency of governments to\nmanipulate information in order to provoke the citizenry toward war.\nIn light of such skepticism, the burden of proof for the justification\nof war is placed upon the government, who must prove that the\ndangerous and presumptively immoral activity of war can in fact be\njustified.\n\nThis sort of skepticism might also be called \u201cprima facie\npacifism\u201d: this is the idea that war is usually wrong except in\ncertain extraordinary circumstances when it is compellingly shown that\nthe evil of war is a sort of lesser evil that is necessary for some\ngreater good. Prima facie pacifism presumes that war is wrong but\nallows for exceptions. Prima facie pacifism places the burden of proof\nupon the proponent of war: it is up to the proponent of war to prove,\nin a given circumstance, that war is in fact morally necessary.\n",
