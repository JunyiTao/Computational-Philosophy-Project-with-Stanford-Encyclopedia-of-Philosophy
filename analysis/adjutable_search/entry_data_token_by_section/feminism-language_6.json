    "main_text": "Critical work on language and philosophy of language || Maleness of language\n1.7 Maleness of language\n\nSome feminists (e.g., Penelope 1990; Spender 1985) argue that English\nis, in some quite general sense, male. (Corresponding arguments are\nalso put forward about other languages.) One thing that is meant by\nthis is that English can be said to be male in a manner similar to\nthat in which particular terms can be said to be male\u2014by\nencoding a male worldview, by helping to subordinate women or to\nrender them invisible, or by taking males as the norm. One sort of\nargument for this begins from the examination of large quantities of\nspecific terms, and the identification of patterns of male bias, and\nproceeds from this to the conclusion that the male bias of English is\nso widespread that it is a mistake to locate the problem in a\ncollection of words, rather than in the language as a whole. The first\nstage of this sort of argument is, obviously, a lengthy and complex\none. The sorts of claims (in addition to those we have already seen)\ncited include (a) that there are more words for males than for females\nin English, and that more of these words are positive (Spender 1985:\n15, citing Julia Stanley 1977); (b) that a \u201cword for women\nassume[s] negative connotations even where it designated the same\nstate or condition as it did for men\u201d (Spender 1985: 17), as\nwith \u2018spinster\u2019 and \u2018bachelor\u2019; (c) that words\nfor women are far more frequently sexualized than words for men, and\nthat this holds true even for neutral words, when they are applied to\nwomen. Dale Spender, citing Lakoff (1975), discusses the example of\n\u2018professional\u2019, comparing \u2018he\u2019s a\nprofessional\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019s a professional\u2019, and\nnoting that the latter is far more likely than the former to be taken\nto mean that the person in question is a prostitute. The sexualisation\nof words for women is considered especially significant by the many\nfeminists who take sexual objectification to be a crucial element, if\nnot the root, of inequalities between women and men. (For more on such\nexamples, see also Baker 1992.)\n\nThis widespread encoding of male bias in language is, according to\ntheorists like Spender, just what we should expect. Males (though not,\nas she notes, all of them) have had far more power in society, and\nthis, she claims has included the power to enforce, through language,\ntheir view of the world. Moreover, she argues, this has served to\nenhance their power.\n\n\nThere is sexism in language, it does enhance the\nposition of males, and males have had control over the\nproduction of cultural forms. (Spender 1985: 144)\n\n\nThis, Spender claims, provides circumstantial evidence that\n\u201cmales have encoded sexism into language to consolidate their\nclaims of male supremacy\u201d (Spender 1985: 144). Spender takes the\nevidence for this claim to be far more than circumstantial, however,\nand to support it she discusses the efforts of prescriptive\ngrammarians. These include, for example, the claim that males should\nbe listed before females because \u201cthe male gender was the\nworthier gender\u201d (Spender 1985: 147, emphasis hers),\nand the efforts (noted earlier) to establish \u2018he\u2019 as the\ngender-neutral third-person English pronoun.\n\nAccording to theorists like Spender, men\u2019s ability to control\nlanguage gives them great power indeed. We have already seen ways in\nwhich what one might call the maleness of language contributes to the\ninvisibility of women (with respect to words like \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018man\u2019). If one takes the maleness of language to go beyond\na few specific terms, one will take language\u2019s power to make\nwomen invisible to be even stronger. We have also seen ways that what\nmight be called maleness can make it more difficult for women to\nexpress themselves. Where we lack words for important female\nexperiences, like sexual harassment, women will find it more difficult\nto describe key elements of their existence. Similarly, where the\nwords we have\u2014like \u2018foreplay\u2019\u2014systematically\ndistort women\u2019s experiences, women will have a difficult time\naccurately conveying the realities of their lives. If one takes such\nproblems to go beyond selected particular terms, and to infect\nlanguage as a whole, it is natural to suppose that women are to a\nlarge degree silenced\u2014unable to accurately articulate\nkey elements of their lives, and unable to communicate important\naspects of their thoughts. Spender and others also suggest that the\nmaleness of language constrains thought, imposing a male\nworldview on all of us, and making alternative visions of reality\nimpossible, or at least very difficult to articulate. These arguments\noften draw upon the so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir 1921; Whorf 1956). \nIt is generally formulated very vaguely, but seems to amount to roughly the hypothesis that \u201cour\nworldview is determined by the structures of the particular language\nthat we happen to speak\u201d (Cameron 1998b: 150).  (There is substantial controversy about what this means, and about the accuracy of attributing it to either Sapir or Whorf, but this controversy is not very relevant to the present entry.)\n\n\nSome suggest that male power over language allows men to shape not\njust thought, but also reality. For example, Spender claims that men\n\u201ccreated language, thought, and reality\u201d (1985: 143). This\nis a very strong version of what Haslanger has called discursive\n constructivism.[3]\n She defines this view as follows:\n\n\nSomething is discursively constructed just in case it is the way it\nis, to some substantial extent, because of what is attributed (and/or\nself-attributed) to it. (Haslanger 1995: 99)\n\n\nFeminists like Spender and Catherine MacKinnon (1989) argue that male\npower over language has allowed them to create reality. This is partly\ndue to the fact that our categorizations of reality inevitably depend\non our social perspective: \u201cthere is no ungendered reality or\nungendered perspective\u201d (MacKinnon 1989: 114). Haslanger (1995)\ndiscusses this argument in detail.\n\nIn general, the solution suggested is not to attempt to create a\nneutral language that can accurately capture reality in itself, a goal\nthey would take to be nonsense. Instead, we must aim to create a new\nreality more congenial to women. Some feminists have argued that the\nonly way to achieve this is for women to create their own language,\neither by redefining terms already in use, or by inventing a new\nlanguage, with new words and new rules. Only in this way, they\nsuggest, will women be able to break free from the constraints of male\nlanguage and male thought, to articulate a competing vision for the\nworld, and to work toward it (Daly and Caputi 1987; Elgin 1985;\nMacKinnon 1989; Penelope 1990; Spender 1985). Lynne Tirrell (1993)\noffers an especially sophisticated and complex discussion of this\nidea.\n\nThe claims discussed above concerning the maleness of\nEnglish, its causes, and its effects, are far from uncontentious.\nFirst, the extent of male bias in language is debatable. Although it\nis right that there is much to worry feminists about a wide variety of\nspecific terms and usages, it is far from clear that it is appropriate\nto claim that English is male-biased in some sweeping sense. It is\nalso unclear exactly what the claim being made is. If this claim is\ntaken to be that every term is male-biased, then it is highly implausible: it is very unlikely that there is a male bias present in\n\u2018piano\u2019 or \u2018isotope\u2019. If the claim is simply\nthat there is much for feminists to object to, then it is almost\ncertainly right\u2014but it is far from obvious that it is useful to\nfocus on such a general claim rather than on specific problems, their\ncomplexities and their possible solutions (Cameron 1998b).\n\nNext, the power that men have undeniably exercised in society (though, importantly, some groups of men have been vastly less powerful than others) by no\nmeans translates to a general power over language. Language is a\ndifficult thing to control, as those who have attempted to create\nlanguages have learned. The main power men have had has concerned\ndictionaries, usage guides, and laws. While these are enormously\nimportant in shaping reality, and in shaping our thoughts, it is quite\na leap to move from this power to the claim that men \u2018created\nlanguage, thought, and reality\u2019.\n\nThe claimed effects of the maleness of language are also problematic.\nWe have already seen problems for the idea that men control language.\nThe idea that men also control or create thought and reality faces\nfurther problems. The ability of feminists to successfully point out\nways in which elements of language have obscured women\u2019s\nexperiences counts strongly against the claim that men control thought\n(Cameron 1998b); and, as Haslanger (1995) has argued in detail,\ndiscursive constructivism about reality is unsustainable. Nonetheless,\nit does seem right to notice that problems with specific terms can\nrender it more difficult for women to communicate about important\nelements of their lives, and probably also more difficult to reflect\nupon these elements (Hornsby 1995). These difficulties could perhaps\nbe described as partial silencing, partial constraint of thought, or\nhermeneutical injustice (Fricker 2007), which we discuss more fully in\n2.4.\n\nIf the criticisms above are right, then women certainly do not need to\ncreate their own language. Many welcome this conclusion, worried that\na women\u2019s language would doom women\u2019s thoughts to\nmarginality and impede feminist progress. Moreover, the idea that\nwomen could craft a common language that allowed the articulation of\nall their experiences seems to ignore the fact that women differ\nenormously from one another (Crenshaw 1991; Lugones and Spelman 1983; Spelman 1988;\nsee the section on\n feminism and the diversity of women\n in the entry on\n feminist philosophy).\n If women cannot use the same language as men, why should we suppose\nthat women can successfully share a language?\n",
