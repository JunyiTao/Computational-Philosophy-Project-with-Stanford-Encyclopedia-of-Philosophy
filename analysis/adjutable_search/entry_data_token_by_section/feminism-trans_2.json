    "main_text": "The Transsexual Empire\n3. The Transsexual Empire\n\n\nMany of the earliest non-trans feminist perspectives on transsexuals\nwere marked by hostility. One of the first examples of non-trans\nfeminist reactions to trans women was the expulsion of Beth Elliott\nfrom the Daughters of Bilitis and the subsequent controversy over her\nparticipation in 1973 in the West Coast Lesbian Conference in Los\nAngeles (Stryker 2008). At the conference, Robin Morgan charged\nElliot, \u201cas an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a\ndestroyer\u2014with the mentality of a rapist\u201d (Morgan 1978,\n181). This theme of \u201cviolation\u201d can also be found in Mary\nDaly's\nGyn/Ecology (1978, 71). It is more thoroughly elaborated in\nJanice Raymond's The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the\nShe-Male (1979) where she writes :\n\n\nAll transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female\nform to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.  However,\nthe transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women's\nsexuality and spirit, as well. Rape, although it is usually done by\nforce, can also be accomplished by deception. (104)\n\n\nThe thesis that MTF transsexuals are rapists because they\nappropriate women's bodies to themselves or through deception is\ndifficult to assess since no arguments seem to have been given in its\ndefense. However it will be worth trying to push such extreme\nrepresentations to the side in order to isolate the core assumptions\nwhich ground Raymond's position as well as to appreciate her\nfeminist critique of transsexuality as a medical phenomenon.\n\nRaymond's position is underwritten by a substrate view about sex\naccording to which sex exists as a given prior to the machinations of\nculture; social sex roles are then assigned on the basis of sex.\n(Raymond does not usually use the term gender,\npreferring, instead, the expression sex role). Membership\nin the category woman is determined by chromosomes and the\nindividual's history of experience being assigned to a sex role\n(1979, 4, 18, 114). In light of this, Raymond maintains that MTF\ntranssexuals are really men and FTM transsexuals are really women. The\nlast condition (history of experience) is important in noting that MTF\ntranssexuals have avoided the history of damage done to women who have\nsuffered a lifetime under sex-role oppression. It is worth\nrecognizing, however, that while MTFs may have avoided this oppression\nbefore transitioning, many MTFs experience sexual harassment and\ndiscrimination in the workplace, the threat of all variations of rape,\nsurvival sex work, and domestic violence after transitioning.\nMoreover, some MTFs live as women from a very young age.\n\nA second underlying assumption of Raymond\u2019s position is that\noppression experienced by transsexuals (and trans people more\ngenerally) is nothing but an aspect of the sexist oppression enforced\nthrough sex role (1979, xviii, 16). In other words, MTFs are really men\nwho are victims of the violence done through the rigidly enforced\nsex-role system and FTMs are really women who, as such, are the central\ntargets of this system. Gender dysphoria experienced by transsexuals,\nin such a view, is to be understood as unhappiness with the existing\nsex-role system. This means that Raymond does not recognize a distinct\nmodality of oppression that specifically targets trans people in a way\nthat is non-reducible to the sexist oppression inherent in sex roles.\nRaymond poses the rhetorical question \u201cDoes a Black person who\nwants to be white suffer from the \u2018disease\u2019 of being a\n\u2018transracial?\u2019\u201d and then observes that \u201cthere is no\ndemand for transracial medical intervention precisely because most\nBlacks recognize that it is their society, not their skin, that needs\nchanging\u201d [Raymond 1994, xvi]. What is lacking in such an account\nis the possibility that transsexuals might be oppressed as\ntranssexuals.\n\nOn the basis of these two theses, Raymond is led to see the\nmedicalization of gender variance and the gender identity clinics as\nnothing but vehicles to further secure sexist sex roles. Thus, for\nher, a sexist society is \u201cthe first cause\u201d of\ntranssexuality (1979, 16). The role of the medical treatment of\ntranssexuality is to turn men into \u201cwomen\u201d and women into\n\u201cmen\u201d when they cannot be normed into their natally\nassigned sex roles. For Raymond, the phrase transsexual\nempire applies to the patriarchal medical establishment which\nperpetuates sex-role oppression through surgical intervention. (She\nuses the word empire to refer to \u201ca political unit having\na territory of great extent, or a number of territories under a single\nsovereign authority\u201d (xv). She sees the medical\n\u201cempire\u201d as including numerous specialties such as\nurology, gynecology, endocrinology, and so forth.  She also sees the\ncollaboration of psychology and psychiatry in hiding what she calls\nthe sovereignty of the medical \u201cempire\u201d by making it\nappear that there is some need for transsexual medical intervention,\nas well as the involvement of lawyers and legislators.  However, it is\nthe medical establishment, for Raymond, which possesses this\nsovereignty. So it is the medical establishment which is the unifying\nauthority of the \u201ctranssexual empire\u201d (ibid.)).\n\n\nNow Raymond is right that the medicalization of transsexuality\ninvolved the perpetuation of sexist (and heterosexist) norms. Yet the\nactual struggle of some scientists and surgeons to make surgeries\navailable to transsexuals is ignored in Raymond's account (Riddell\n2006). Such advocates for transsexual surgery were in the minority\n(certainly in the U.S) and themselves experienced hostility and\nmarginalization. This means that what Raymond calls the transsexual\nempire was not monolithic. And given the marginalization of\nthese advocates for transsexual surgery, it seems that the medical\nestablishment was not especially friendly to transsexuality (Riddell\n2006). Generally transsexuality was and remains largely unaccepted in\nsociety. Contrary to Raymond's view, it is largely not\nendorsed by \u201cthe patriarchy.\u201d\n\n\nRaymond's contrast between integration and\nintegrity brings out a core aspect of her picture of\nliberation. Integration, for Raymond, involves putting\ntogether parts to form a complex whole (1979, 163). She sees androgyny\nas a kind of blend between masculine and feminine and she argues that\ntranssexual surgery also brings about such blends (constructing the\nindividual into a kind of hermaphroditic being) (1979, 165). By\ncontrast, integrity involves a prior wholeness from which no\npart can be taken away (193). For Raymond, true liberation cannot be\nsecured by any mere blending of sex roles. Rather, it must be secured\nthrough a transcendence of sex role altogether (164). This\nsuggests a notion of the self that is prior to sex role or at least a\nnotion of a self that can be freed from the cultural interpretations of\nsex. Raymond's solution to \u201cthe problem\u201d of\ntranssexuality which she sees as promoting the surgical violation of\nbodily integrity, is to \u201cmorally mandate it out of\nexistence\u201d (178) by working against sex role oppression through\neducation and consciousness raising (178\u2013185).\n\nRaymond's representation of transsexuals themselves warrants\nparticular comment. Beyond the two key assumptions mentioned above,\nRaymond adopts a stance for which transsexual subjectivities are\nerased. This means that she constructs monolithic, stereotypical\nrepresentations of trans individuals (based on her own ideology) in\nways that foreclose the possibility of registering the actual variable\nexperiences of trans people (on this point see Riddell 2006, 152\u20133,\nStone 1991, 298, Heyes 2003, 1095). She points to ways in which (some)\nMTFs take up traditional sex roles (and are thereby complicit) on the\none hand (77\u201379), and yet goes on to criticize lesbian-separatist\nidentified MTFs who have eschewed such roles as oppressively masculine\n(102\u20136). In this way, she traps MTF transsexuals with a double-bind:\nEither MTFs take up traditional sex roles and are thereby sexist or\nelse they eschew these traditional sex roles and are thereby sexist\n(See Califia 1997, 102, 104\u20135; Serano 2007, 49). Such a theory\nisn't equipped to accommodate the actual variable experiences of\nMTFs trying to negotiate gender in a sexist and transphobic world. In this way,\nRaymond's theory erases the actual experiences of MTFs through\nmonolithic, ideologically-driven representations of them. Moreover\nbecause Raymond sees transsexuality as essentially a male phenomenon,\nher discussion of FTMs is minimal. She argues that FTMs are mere tokens\nwho are used to prop up claims that transsexuality is a universal\nphenomenon and thereby hide its true patriarchal character. In this\nway, FTM transsexuality is largely dropped out of the picture (xxiii,\n27\u201328, 140; for further critique see Califia 1997, 100\u20131, Serano 2007,\n48). This allows her to avoid discussing FTM transsexuals in any depth\nat all. And this means that the complex, variable, everyday experiences\nof FTMs do not get represented in the first place. Consider, for\nexample, Raymond's claim \u201cAll transsexuals rape\nwomen's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact,\nappropriating this body for themselves.\u201d While the statement\npurports to be universal, it is also a claim specifically about MTF\ntranssexuals. In Raymond's account, there is no room for FTMs.\nThey are erased.\n\n\nWhile this tendency to forgo consideration of the real life\nexperiences of trans people in favor of monolithic, stereotypical\nrepresentations of them (or through outright erasure) seems to have\nbeen common in academic writing at the time, it is also worth noting\nthe deep theoretical and political commitments at work. Raymond's\naccount is situated within a lesbian-separatist paradigm which sees\nwomen's oppression as secured through compulsory heterosexual\nrelationships (Radicalesbians [1970] 1988). In this heterosexual\ncontext, women are forced to adopt an identity that is male-dominant\n(man-identified). Liberation from the colonization of identity can only\nbe obtained through lesbian relationships and a community of\nwomen-identified women. Central to this paradigm of oppression/\nliberation, then, is the view that a woman's identity can be\nthoroughly colonized as well as the view that this can possibly be\neliminated through loving lesbian relationships (Frye 1983). It is one,\nthen, which does not see the self as inherently bound up with gender or\nsex role.\n\n\nGiven this account, it is no surprise that Raymond criticizes\nMoney's view that gender identity, while determined by\nenvironmental factors, is \u201clocked down\u201d at an early age\n(1979, 62\u20138). And given the separation between sex and role, it becomes\napparent why transsexual claims about gender identity become hard to\nfathom. On the one hand, identity might involve the internalization of\nand identification with the sexist gender roles from which, according\nto Raymond, we need to find transcendence. This would obviously cry out\nfor feminist intervention. On the other hand, since Raymond accepts a\nview according to which sex is a given, biological substrate upon which\ncultural role is assigned, identity may simply be taken to reflect\nrecognition of one's own invariant biological sex (male or\nfemale). Such an identity would survive any transcendence from cultural\nsex role. In this case, however, any purported misalignment between\nbody and identity would seem deeply misguided (since identity merely\nreflects one's invariant biological sex).\n",
