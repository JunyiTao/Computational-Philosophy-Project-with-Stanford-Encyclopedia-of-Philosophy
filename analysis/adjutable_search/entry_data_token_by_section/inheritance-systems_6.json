    "main_text": "Reproduction and Replication || Inheritance and replication\n2.2 Inheritance and replication\n\nAs mentioned earlier, two major influences led to the emphasis on\nreplication as a necessary condition for evolution via natural\nselection: the influence of the replicator framework and the discovery\nof the molecular basis of genetic inheritance, in particular DNA\nreplication. In their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA, James Watson\nand Francis Crick famously noted that the properties of the double\nhelix structure suggest a straightforward method for replicating the\nDNA sequence. It is now known that DNA replication is\nsemiconservative: each of the strands of the double stranded DNA\nmolecule is used as a template for constructing a complementary\nstrand, and the replication process results in two DNA molecules, each\ncontaining one of the original strands and one newly constructed\nstrand. In the absence of mutations, each of the new double stranded\nDNA molecules has the same sequence of base pairs (nucleotides) the\noriginal DNA molecule had. DNA replication explains how the\ninformation in the DNA sequence is copied, so that when the cell\ndivides each daughter cell ends up with a complete copy of the\noriginal cell\u2019s DNA. This is a critical element of genetic\ninheritance, though the genetic inheritance processes of mitosis and\nmeiosis are far more involved than DNA replication, which is only one\ncomponent of them.\n\nWhen considered from the perspective of accounting for the reliable\nreconstruction of parental phenotypes, replication of the kind found\nin genetic inheritance is seen to be neither sufficient nor necessary\nfor heredity (Jablonka 2004, has a particularly clear discussion of\nthese issues). The inheritance of cellular properties as a consequence\nof self-sustaining metabolic loops, one kind of cellular epigenetic\ninheritance, is an example of inheritance not involving replicators.\nPartly on the basis of cellular epigenetic inheritance and similar\nobservations about other forms of extra-genetic inheritance, such as\nbehavioral and linguistic transmission, that do not conform with the\nreplicator framework, Jablonka has argued that the\nreplicator/interactor distinction should be rejected (Jablonka 2001,\n2004). More generally, she argued that \u201cthe replicator/vehicle\ndichotomy\u2026 is meaningless in all cases in which the\ntransmission of information or the generation of new heritable\ninformation depends on development\u201d (Jablonka 2001: 114).\nGodfrey-Smith (2009: sec. 2.4) discusses formal arguments showing that\nreplicators are not a necessary condition for evolution by natural\nselection.\n\nDNA replication is also not sufficient for explaining cellular\nheredity, since cellular heredity depends on support from epigenetic\nnuclear and cytoplasmatic inheritance mechanisms that maintain proper\ngene regulation. This point has been made during the historical\ndebates about cytoplasmatic inheritance (Nanney 1958; Sapp 1987).\nMoreover, cellular epigenetic inheritance is essential for cell\ndifferentiation in multi-cellular organisms, which involves the\nestablishment of lineages of cells that produce tissue specific\nphenotypes that are not due to differences in DNA sequence.\nDifferentiated cells inherit their tissue-specificity, which they\nusually do not alter throughout their life-cycle. This means that in\naddition to its role in cellular heredity, cellular epigenetic\ninheritance is essential for the multi-generation reconstruction of\nphenotypes of multi-cellular organisms, regardless of any direct role\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance plays in the transmission of\ncharacters from parent to offspring above the cellular level, though\nsuch effects are also well known (see Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n",
