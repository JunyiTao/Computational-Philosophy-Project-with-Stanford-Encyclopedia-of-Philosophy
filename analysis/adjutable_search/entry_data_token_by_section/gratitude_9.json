    "main_text": "Accounts of Gratitude || Gratitude as Emotion\n4.1 Gratitude as Emotion\n\nGratitude is often conceptualized as an emotion (see, e.g.,\nMacnamara 2019). Emotions, such as fear and sadness, are occurrent\ncomplex mental states that arise in response to certain stimuli. They\nare more than just feelings, in that emotions are\nintentional, or about something, while feelings (like the\nfeeling of euphoria) need not be; and emotions imply or include\nbeliefs and motivational tendencies, while feelings need not. On the\nother hand, emotions differ from moods, like anxiety, in that\nan emotion is usually more short-lived than a mood, which can be\nlonger lasting, and not about anything in particular. Emotions are\noften thought to involve certain propositional content, and thus to\nserve the function of representing the world (and, particularly, their\nstimulus) as being a certain way. To say that gratitude is an emotion,\nthen, is to say that gratitude is a particular complex of beliefs,\nfeelings and motivational tendencies arising in a beneficiary in\nresponse to, and targeted at, an act of beneficence from a benefactor.\nGratitude as an emotion may involve propositional content (e.g., that\nbenefactor R performed some benevolent act for me), and may\nrepresent its target as being a certain way (e.g., benefactor\nR is benevolent, brave, cares about me).\n\nConceiving of gratitude as an emotion has a certain plausibility. The\nconcept of emotion provides a familiar framework for integrating many\nof the cognitive, affective and conative elements of the grateful\nresponse under one conceptual roof. Nevertheless, conceptualizing\ngratitude as an emotion (and nothing more) comes at certain\ntheoretical costs. The first stems from the fact that emotions are\nepisodic: an emotion is typically not the sort of thing we\nexperience or undergo continuously for years at a time. But though a\nbeneficiary might go years without instantiating or experiencing the\nemotion of gratitude, he might still all that time be\ngrateful to some benefactor for a genuine act of benevolence performed\nin the past, insofar as he is properly disposed to believe, feel and\nact toward her as a grateful beneficiary should. An analogy with the\nemotion of love is helpful here. It is (often) true that I love my\nmother in moments when I do not experience any emotion of love\nregarding her (in moments when my full attention is on some other\nemotionally salient object, say). This suggests that whatever love is,\nit must be more than the emotion of love. So too for gratitude.\n\nIn the second place, conceiving of gratitude as an emotion might\nincline us to overlook a certain way in which the grateful beneficiary\nis sometimes motivated to grateful action. An emotion influences\nbehavior in a particular way\u2014that is, by providing or\nconstituting a certain natural inclination. A grateful beneficiary,\nhowever, might sometimes find his natural inclinations to benefit a\nbenefactor overwhelmed by other natural inclinations; and in these\ncases, a truly grateful beneficiary will be prepared to muster an\neffort of will to act against the balance of his natural inclinations\n(see\n section 3.4.2\n above). Most conceptions of emotion, however, do not allow that\nemotions can motivate in this particular way. Insofar as this\npreparedness to muster an effort of will is necessary for true\ngratitude, then, it may be misleading to claim that gratitude is\n(nothing more than) an emotion. It might be fairer to say that many of\nthe elements of gratitude can be explained by or accounted for in an\nemotion (what we might call the emotion of gratitude), but\nthere is more to gratitude (the proper response to an act of\nbeneficence from an agent) than can be accounted for in an\nemotion.\n",
