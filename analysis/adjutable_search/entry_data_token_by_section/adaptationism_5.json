    "main_text": "Testing and Standards of Evidence\n3. Testing and Standards of Evidence\n\n\n An important part of the\nadaptationism debate concerns the testing of adaptive and non-adaptive\nhypotheses. The belief that scientific practice in evolutionary\nbiology does not adhere to the proper standards of evidence motivates\nmany of the critiques of adaptationism. This concern has been taken\nseriously by some evolutionary biologists; for example, Rose and Lauder\n(1996) claimed that a central task of contemporary evolutionary biology\nis to articulate a \u201cpost-Spandrels adaptationism,\u201d a task\nthat involves improving testing methods by including comparative and\nmolecular data, conducting careful long-term studies in both the\nlaboratory and the wild, and incorporating a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of development and constraint.\n\n\n We now discuss testing of\nadaptationism itself and the associated implications for testing\nevolutionary hypotheses generally, and the sort of epistemic\ndifficulties that must be overcome. We highlight how the debate\nhas led to increased understanding of the importance of phylogenetic\nmethods, of the viability of optimality models as tools for testing\nadaptive hypotheses, and of whether constraint hypotheses are rivals to\nadaptive hypotheses or provide the backdrop against which we test\nhypotheses about the evolutionary process.\n",
