Hobbes thinks that we incur\nbinding obligations when we make pledges under the appropriate\nconditions. By contrast, Spinoza maintains that \u201cthe validity of\nan agreement rests on its utility, without which the agreement\nautomatically becomes null and void\u201d (TTP 16/182; cf. TP\n2/12). To demand otherwise would be absurd, since men are bound by\nnature to choose what appears to be the greater good or lesser\nevil. We are bound by nature to act on our strongest interest and\ncannot be obligated by previous agreements to break this inviolable\npsychological law of nature.\n\n\nBy adhering to a strict naturalism about right and obligation and\nmaintaining that \u201cthe sovereign power in a State has right over a\nsubject only in proportion to the excess of its power over that of a\nsubject\u201d (Epistle 50), Spinoza, unlike Hobbes, places the burden\nof political stability on the sovereign rather than the subject (see\nWernham 1958, 27). The commonwealth must be structured so as to promote\ncompliance; when there is excessive vice or non-compliance, the blame\nmust be \u201claid at the door of the commonwealth\u201d (TP 5/3).\nSo, whereas Hobbes argues that the sovereign is always vested with\nnearly absolute legislative authority, Spinoza claims that \u201csince\nthe right of a commonwealth is determined by the collective power of a\npeople, the greater the number of subjects who are given cause by a\ncommonwealth to join in conspiracy against it, the more must its power\nand right be diminished\u201d (TP 3/9). If a sovereign is to maintain\nits right, it must legislate wisely, so as not to incite insurrection.\nSo while Spinoza does not accord to the people a proper right of\nrevolution, he proposes a naturalistic equivalent, since the right of\nthe state is essentially constituted, and limited, by the power of the\npeople (TP 2/17) (see Sharp 2013).\n\n\nThus, when Spinoza points to the differences between his view of\nnatural right and Hobbes\u2019 in his letter to Jelles, differences\nthat might appear negligible to the casual reader, he is identifying a\nsignificant distinction (see Wernham 1958, 35). Spinoza\u2019s\nthoroughgoing naturalism leads him to reject the sharp distinction that\nHobbes draws between civil state\u2014the product of\nartifice\u2014and the state of nature, along with the concomitant\nconception of obligation that arises with the inception of the\ncommonwealth. But given his naturalism and repudiation of rights and\nobligations as traditionally understood, one might be left wondering\nhow or whether Spinoza could offer a normative political theory at\nall.\n",
