    "main_text": "Some groups of ITV\u2019s and their behavior\n1. Some groups of ITV\u2019s and their behavior\n\nSearch verbs and desire verbs manifest all three of the behaviors\nlisted in the prologue as \u201cmarks\u201d or effects of\nintensionality. Thus, Lois Lane may be seeking Superman. But it does\nnot seem to follow that she is seeking Clark, even though Superman is\nClark, and so we have an example of the first kind of anomaly\nmentioned in the prologue: substitution of one name with another for\nthe same person leads to a change in truth-value for the embedding\nsentence (here \u201cLois is seeking Superman\u201d). Similarly, a\nthirsty person who believes that water quenches thirst and that\nH2O is a kind of rat poison may want some water but not\nsome H2O. [According to some, this alleged failure of\nsubstitution to preserve truth-value is an illusion; but for reasons\nof space I do not pursue this theory \u2014 its locus\nclassicus is (Salmon 1986).]\n\nSecond, both search verbs and desire verbs create specific-unspecific\nambiguities in their containing VPs when the syntactic object of the\nverb consists in a determiner followed by a nominal (this ambiguity is\nalso known as the relational/notional ambiguity, following Quine 1956,\nwhere it was first studied, at least in the modern period). For\nexample, \u2018Oedipus is seeking a member of his family\u2019 could\nbe true because Oedipus is seeking specifically Jocasta, who is a\nmember of his family, though he doesn\u2019t realize it. On such an\noccasion, what is true can be more carefully stated as \u2018there is\na member of his family such that Oedipus is seeking that\nperson\u2019. The alternative, unspecific or notional reading, is\nforced by adding \u2018but no particular one\u2019: \u2018Oedipus\nis seeking a member of his family, but no particular one\u2019. Here\nOedipus is implied just to have a general intention to find some\nmember or other of his family. Contrast the extensional\n\u2018embrace\u2019: Oedipus cannot embrace a member of his family,\nbut no particular one. \n\nThird, it is obvious that it is possible both to want, and to search\nfor, that which does not exist, for instance, a fountain of eternal\nyouth. But it isn\u2019t possible to, say, stumble across such a thing,\nunless it exists.\n\nDepiction verbs, such as \u2018draw\u2019, \u2018sculpt\u2019, and\n\u2018imagine\u2019, resist substitution in their syntactic objects,\nat least if the clausal \u2018imagine\u2019 does: if imagining that\nSuperman rescues you is not the same thing as imagining that Clark\nrescues you, it is hard to see why imagining Superman would be the\nsame thing as imagining Clark. A specific/unspecific ambiguity is also\npossible, as is attested by the wall label for Guercino\u2019s The\nAldrovandi Dog (ca. 1625) in the Norton Simon Museum,\nwhich states \u2018this must be the portrait of a specific\ndog\u2019, thereby implicating an alternative, that \u2018Guercino\ndrew a dog\u2019 could be taken to mean that he drew a dog,\nbut no particular dog \u2014 he just made one up. And we can clearly\ndraw or imagine that which does not exist (as opposed to, say,\nphotographing it). Braque\u2019s Little Harbor in Normandy (1909)\nis an example, according to the curators of the Art Institute of\nChicago: \u2018it appears this work was painted from imagination,\nsince the landscape depicted cannot be identified.\u2019\n\nHowever, whether or not a notional reading of a depiction VP is\npossible depends on which quantificational determiner occurs in the\nnoun phrase complement. If we say \u2018Guercino drew every\ndog\u2019, \u2018Guercino drew most dogs\u2019, or \u2018Guercino\ndrew the dog\u2019 (non-anaphoric \u2018the dog\u2019), we seem to\nadvert to some antecedent domain with respect to which \u2018drew\nevery/most/the dog(s)\u2019 are to be evaluated. So specific readings\nare\n required.[1]\n This resistance to unspecific construal is robust across languages\nand is typical of those quantificational determiners which do not\noccur naturally in existential contexts such as \u2018there\nis\u2019: contrast \u2018there is a dog in the garden\u2019 with\n\u2018there is every dog in the garden\u2019, \u2018there are most\ndogs in the garden\u2019, or \u2018there is the dog in the\ngarden\u2019. An account of what is wrong with \u2018there is every\ndog in the garden\u2019 (see Keenan 2003) might well contain the\nmaterials for explaining the lack of unspecific readings of depiction\nVPs with determiners like \u2018every\u2019, \u2018most\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019; see further (Forbes 2006:142\u2013150).\n\nIt should be emphasized that depiction verbs are special in this\nrespect, for there is no problem getting unspecific readings with\n\u2018every\u2019, \u2018most\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019 using\ndesire verbs or search verbs. Guercino might be looking for every dog\non Aldrovandi\u2019s estate, though there are no particular dogs he is\nlooking for; the reader might be driving around an unfamiliar airport\nrental car lot, looking for the exit, and in this case there is no\nexit such that it is being sought. (\u2018look\u2019 isn\u2019t\nreally a transitive verb, but when the following preposition is\n\u2018for\u2019, a search activity is denoted, so it is customary to\ncount the likes of \u2018looking for\u2019 as a \u201ctransitive\nverb\u201d in contexts where intensionality is under discussion.)\n\nMixed behavior is also manifested by evaluative verbs, for example\n\u2018respect\u2019, \u2018admire\u2019, \u2018disdain\u2019,\n\u2018worship\u2019, including emotion verbs such as \u2018lust\n(after)\u2019 and \u2018fear\u2019. Lex Luthor might fear Superman,\nbut not Clark, and Lois might disdain Clark, but not Superman.\nHowever, unspecific readings of VPs with quantified complements are\nharder to hear, at least when the quantifier is existential.\n\u2018Lois admires an extraterrestrial\u2019 can be heard in two\nways: there is the \u2018admires a particular extraterrestrial\u2019\nreading, and there is a generic reading, which means that\namong the kinds of thing she admires are extraterrestrials in general.\nGeneric readings of evaluative VPs attribute dispositions, and are\nnot the same as unspecific or notional readings (see Cohen 1999, 2008,\nand the entry on\n generics).\n There does not seem to be a sensible non-generic construal of\n\u2018Lois admires an extraterrestrial, but no particular\none\u2019.\n\nThe verb \u2018need\u2019 is an interesting case. A sports team\nmight need a better coach, though no specific better coach, and might\nneed a better coach even if there are none to be had. So two out of\nthree marks of intensionality are present. However, \u2018need\u2019\ncontrasts with \u2018want\u2019 as regards substitution: our\ndehydrated subject who does not want H2O because he\nbelieves it to be a kind of rat poison, nevertheless needs\nH2O. It seems that co-denoting terms may be interchanged in\nthe complement of \u2018need\u2019. But merely accidentally\nco-extensive ones cannot be: Larson (2001, 232) gives the example of\nMax the theater impresario, who needs more singers but not more\ndancers, even though all who sing dance, and vice-versa. The property\nsinger and the property dancer are different\nproperties, so expressions for them cannot be exchanged in the\ncomplement of \u2018need\u2019. Similar restricted substitutivity is\nobserved with transaction verbs such as \u2018wager\u2019,\n\u2018owe\u2019, \u2018buy\u2019, \u2018sell\u2019,\n\u2018reserve\u2019, and perhaps the transaction resultative\n\u2018own\u2019. One may reserve a table at a restaurant, though\nthere need not be a specific table one has reserved in making the\nreservation, since the restaurant may be expecting a slow night. But\nthese verbs do allow interchange of co-referential expressions (a\npurchase of water-rights is a purchase of H2O-rights)\nthough not (Zimmerman 1993, 151) of accidentally co-extensive ones.\nFor \u2018own\u2019 see (Zimmerman 2001, passim).\n\nIndeed, it is even arguable that some marks of intensionality are\npresent with verbs that allow interchange of accidentally\nco-extensive expressions. A case in point is verbs of absence, such as\n\u2018omit\u2019 and \u2018lack\u2019. If it so happens that all\nand only the physicists on the faculty are the faculty\u2019s Nobel prize\nwinners, then a faculty committee that lacks a physicist lacks a Nobel\nprize winner. However, not too much weight can be put on this case,\nsince it may be that at some level, \u2018lack\u2019 should be\nanalyzed (possibly in a complicated way) in terms of not\nhaving, in which case it would not really be an intensional verb\nat all; though so far as the author knows, no convincing analysis of\nthis type has been formulated. See (Zimmerman 2001, 516\u201320) for\nfurther discussion of relationships among the marks of\nintensionality.\n",
