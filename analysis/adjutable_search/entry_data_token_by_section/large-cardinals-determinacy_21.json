    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Summary\n5.  Philosophical Discussion\n\nLet us return to the question of pluralism. Do the above results\ncollectively provide us with a strong extrinsic justification of\nADL(\u211d) and thereby secure non-pluralism at\nthis level? \n\n The pluralist will certainly accept the above results\u2014after\nall, they are mathematical theorems\u2014but will resist the claim\nthat they provide us with theoretical reasons for adopting\nADL(\u211d). The pluralist may grant that the\nresults are quite interesting and that they show that\nADL(\u211d) has a certain appeal\u2014since, for\nexample, it renders L(\u211d) a paradise for\nanalysts\u2014but they will view this as a practical reason for\nadopting ADL(\u211d), not a theoretical reason. On\nthis view there are many roads that one can take\u2014V\n= L, ADL(\u211d), etc.\u2014and that while\neach has its advantages with respect to certain aims there is no\n\u201cfact of the matter\u201d as to which is the correct one, any\nmore than there is a \u201cfact of the matter\u201d as to which of\ntwo notations is the correct notation. At this level, according to the\npluralist, no theoretical reasons are at play and there is no issue of\nobjective mathematical truth. This is the view of Feferman (1999),\nKanamori (2003), Shelah (2003), and many other philosophers and\nmathematicians. \n\n The non-pluralist regards the above results as collectively\nproviding very strong theoretical reasons for thinking that\nADL(\u211d) holds and that the other, incompatible\nalternatives fail. This is the view of Martin (1998), Steel (2000),\nWoodin (2005a), many philosophers and mathematicians, and most\ndescriptive set theorists and inner model theorists. \n\n As we mentioned in the introduction, some pluralists and\nnon-pluralists take realism to be prior to reason while others take\nreason to be prior to realism. It is important to keep these two\nversions separate and address them individually. \n\n Let us start with those who take realism to be prior to reason. To\nfix ideas consider the pluralist who accepts realism about the natural\nnumbers but not about arbitrary subsets of natural numbers and then,\non this basis, concludes that theoretical reasons can be offered in\nthe case of new axioms in number theory but not in the case of\nanalysis or set theory. When pressed on the source of this\nasymmetrical stance concerning realism in the two domains the\npluralist usually responds by resorting to the intuition that the\nnatural numbers are \u201cclear\u201d while the notion of an\narbitrary subset of natural numbers is \u201cinherently\nvague\u201d. To this the non-pluralist might respond that the notion\nof clarity is not clear. Intuitions of clarity, like intuitions of\nself-evidence, are notoriously vague and subjective and hence a weak\npoint upon which to rest one's case. \n\n Let us now turn to those who take reason to be prior to\nrealism. People in this category take objectivity to be the hallmark\nof realism and they come to their conclusions concerning realism about\na given domain only after one has a good understanding of what kind of\ntheoretical reasons have traction in that domain. A pluralist who\nthinks that theoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately\ntrace back to axioms which are self-evident will be unmoved by the\nabove extrinsic case. Likewise for a pluralist who thinks that\ntheoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately trace back to\naxioms that are extrinsically justified. The case we have given is\nclearly an extrinsic one. The issue, then, comes down to the\nlegitimacy of extrinsic justifications. \n\n We are certainly not in a position to resolve this debate\nhere. But it will be helpful to draw a parallel with the debate\nbetween the instrumentalist and non-instrumentalist\nin physics. An extreme form of instrumentalism was advanced by the\nneo-Kantian Hans Vaihinger in his book The Philosophy of As\nIf (1911). According to this view, the \u201chard data\u201d of\nphysics consists in the data of our immediate sense impressions. Upon\nthis basis we are free to construct\u2014in common sense and in\nphysics\u2014a \u201creality\u201d, but the result is not genuine\nknowledge\u2014rather, it is a useful fiction for moving around in\neveryday life and making predictions in physics. In a similar fashion,\nthe extreme pluralist takes the \u201chard data\u201d to consist of\nthe theorems that have actually been established and regards\neverything else as a useful fiction. \n\n In the physical case the non-instrumentalist sees theoretical\nreason at play at a much higher-level, far beyond the data. For\nexample, in the time of Copernicus, when the Ptolemaic and Copernican\ntheory were observationally indistinguishable, theoretical reasons\ncould still be given for the Copernican theory over the Ptolemaic\n theory.[15]\n Similarly in the set theoretic case the non-pluralist sees theoretical\nreason at play at higher level, beyond the theorems and the\nintrinsically plausible statements. Just as in astronomy the\nnon-instrumentalist finds evidence of a higher-level structure in the\nconstellation of connections, likewise in the case of set theory the\nnon-pluralist takes the constellation of connections in the\ninterpretability hierarchy\u2014in particular, the above theorems\nconcerning ADL(\u211d)\u2014as providing evidence\nof structure of a higher level. There is, of course, much more to be\nsaid. But we hope to have brought the issues to the fore. \n\n It should be mentioned that the non-pluralist about\nADL(\u211d) is open to the possibility that\npluralism holds at higher levels, say at the level of CH. For a\ntreatment of that subject see the entry\n \u201cThe Continuum Hypothesis\u201d\n\n",
