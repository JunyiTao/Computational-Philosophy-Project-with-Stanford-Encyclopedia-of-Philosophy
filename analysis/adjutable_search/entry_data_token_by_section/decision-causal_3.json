A subjunctive conditional is true if and only if in the\nnearest antecedent-world, its consequent is true. (This analysis is\nunderstood so that a subjunctive conditional is true if its antecedent\nis true in no world.) Stalnaker used analysis of subjunctive\nconditionals to ground their role in decision theory and in a\nresolution of Newcomb\u2019s problem.\nIn a letter to Lewis, Stalnaker (1972) proposed a way of\nreconciling decision principles in Newcomb\u2019s problem. He\nsuggested calculating an act\u2019s expected utility using\nprobabilities of conditionals in place of conditional\nprobabilities. Accordingly,\n\n\\[\n\\textit{EU} (A) = \\sum_i P(A \\gt S_i)\\util (A \\amp S_i),\n\\] \n\n\nwhere \\(A \\gt S_i\\) stands for the conditional that if \\(A\\) were\nperformed then \\(S_i\\) would obtain. Thus, instead of using the\nprobability of a prediction of one-boxing given one-boxing, one should\nuse the probability of the conditional that if the agent were to pick\njust one box, then the prediction would have been one-boxing. Because\nthe agent\u2019s act does not cause the prediction, the probability\nof the conditional equals the probability that the prediction is\none-boxing. Also, consider the conditional that if the agent were to\npick both boxes, then the prediction would have been one-boxing. Its\nprobability similarly equals the probability that the prediction is\none-boxing. The act the agent performs does not affect any\nprediction\u2019s probability because the prediction occurs prior to\nthe act. Consequently, using probabilities of conditionals to compute\nexpected utility, two-boxing\u2019s expected utility exceeds\none-boxing\u2019s expected utility. Therefore, the principle of\nexpected-utility maximization makes the same recommendation as does\nthe principle of dominance.\n\nGibbard and Harper (1978) elaborated and made public Stalnaker\u2019s\nresolution of Newcomb\u2019s problem. They distinguished causal\ndecision theory, which uses probabilities of subjunctive conditionals,\nfrom evidential decision theory, which uses conditional probabilities.\nBecause in decision problems probabilities of subjunctive conditionals\ntrack causal relations, using them to calculate an option\u2019s\nexpected utility makes decision theory causal.\n\nGibbard and Harper distinguished two types of expected utility. One\ntype they called value and represented with \\(V\\). It indicates\nnews-value or auspiciousness. The other type they called utility and\nrepresented with \\(U\\). It indicates efficacy in attainment of goals.\nA calculation of an act\u2019s expected value uses conditional\nprobabilities, and a calculation of its expected utility uses\nprobabilities of conditionals. They argued that expected utility,\ncalculated with probabilities of conditionals, yields genuine expected\nutility.\n\nAs Gibbard and Harper introduce \\(V\\) and \\(U\\), both rest on an\nassessment \\(D\\) (for desirability) of maximally specific outcomes.\nInstead of adopting a formula for expected utility that uses an\nassessment of outcomes neutral with respect to evidential and causal\ndecision theory, this essay follows Stalnaker (1972) in adopting a\nformula that uses utility to evaluate outcomes.\n",
