    "main_text": "Causation and Quantum Mechanics\n8. Causal Explanation\n\nThe philosophical literature on causal explanation in general and in\nphysics, more specifically, has developed largely independently of,\nand without engaging with, philosophical discussions in the\nneo-Russellian tradition questioning the legitimacy of causal concepts\nin physics (with Woodward\u2019s work being a notable exception). In\nfact, while neo-Russellian arguments have attracted renewed attention\nsince the turn of the twenty-first century and continue to be widely\nendorsed, causal or causal-mechanical theories of explanation, which\nwere developed in response to problems faced by the\ndeductive-nomological model of scientific explanation developed by\nCarl Hempel (Hempel & Oppenheim 1948), arguably have become the\ndefault view in the philosophical literature on scientific explanation\n(Woodward 2003b [2019]). In fact, one central recent debate within\nthis literature takes for granted that there are causal explanations\nand then discusses whether all scientific explanations are\ncausal (Lewis 1986; Skow 2014) or whether there is room for genuinely\nnon-causal scientific explanations as well (Lange 2016).\n\nEarlier defenders of causal accounts of explanation took one\ndistinguishing feature of causal accounts to be their metaphysical,\nor\u2014as Alberto Coffa called it\u2014ontic conception of\nexplanation. The goal of explanation, on this conception is to locate\na phenomenon within the objective \u201ccausal nexus\u201d (Salmon\n1984: 120). Yet as Woodward\u2019s (2003a) work shows, is that it\nalso possible to investigate the relation between explanation and\ncausation within the functional project of examining the cognitive\nrole of explanatory and causal judgments and their connection to\nprediction, manipulation, and control.\n\nCausal imperialists, as we might call them, argue that all\nscientific explanations are fundamentally causal. Neo-Russellians, by\ncontrast, deny that causal notions and causal explanation can play any\nrole in suitably fundamental theories of physics. Yet, despite their\nstark disagreement, neo-Russellians and causal imperialists share a\ncommitment to what Woodward has called \u201cthe hidden structure\nstrategy\u201d (Woodward 2003b [2019]). Both views are committed to\nthe existence of what Peter Railton has called an \u201cideal\nexplanatory text\u201d (Railton 1981) that contains all the\ninformation relevant to a complete explanation of some phenomenon.\nWhile actual explanations may fall short of providing us with the\ncomplete information contained in the ideal explanatory text, they are\nexplanatory, according to the hidden structure strategy, in virtue of\nproviding us with some information about the text.\n\nFor the neo-Russellian, the fundamental explanatory structures consist\nof microphysically complete dynamical models of the backward lightcone\nof a given explanandum. While the neo-Russellian view is\ncompatible with the claim that in some non-fundamental domains and for\npragmatic reasons information about the ideal explanatory text may\nfruitfully be presented in causal terms, the view holds that ideal\nphysical explanations are not causal. Causal imperialism turns this\npicture on its head: for Lewis and others the underlying ideal\nexplanatory structures are causal structures. Hence all explanations\nare causal in virtue of the fact that they provide information about\nthis structure, even though the information provided in an actual\nexplanation may not be presented in causal terms.\n\nAs Woodward (2003b [2019]) has argued, a problem for the hidden\nstructure strategy is to explain how hidden structures that are\nepistemically inaccessible to us can account for the explanatory\nimport of the explanatory accounts we give. For the neo-Russellian the\nproblem is that we seem to be able to provide successful causal\nexplanations of phenomena even when the complete initial data that are\npart of the ideal explanatory text are in principle inaccessible to\nus. The causal imperialist\u2019s version of the hidden structure\nstrategy faces an analogous problem. There are apparently successful\nexplanations of phenomena that do not identify causes of the\nphenomenon.\n\nConsider for example an explanation of the heat capacity of metals\nand, in particular, of the fact that the heat capacity is much lower\nthan predicted classically (Kittel 2005: 141ff). The explanation\nappeals to the Pauli exclusion principle and shows how the heat\ncapacity depends on particle statistics. In order to get the correct\nresult for the heat capacity, we need to model free electrons in the\nmetal as satisfying the quantum-mechanical Fermi-Dirac statistics and\nthe exclusion principle. The explanation appeals to the structure of\nthe phase-space available to the electrons.\n\nAccording to causal imperialists, such as Lewis, this explanation is\ncausal by virtue of the fact that it provides information about the\ncausal history of a sample of metal. Does this construal of the\nexplanation as pointing to a hidden causal structure allow us to make\nperspicuous its explanatory import? As we have seen, Pearl\u2019s and\nWoodward\u2019s accounts of causation emphasize two features as\ncharacteristic functions of causal notions. First, knowledge of causal\nstructures allows us to identify relationships amenable to\nmanipulation and control; and second, common cause reasoning enables\nus to draw inferences from one time to another even when we possess\nonly incomplete knowledge of the state of a system on an initial or\nfinal value surface.\n\nNow, the explanation of the heat capacity embeds its\nexplanandum into patterns of functional dependencies and\nallows us to answer how the heat capacity would change if the\navailable phase space were different. That is, the explanation does\nenable us to answer what Woodward calls\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions (Woodward 1979),\nwhich, according to Woodward\u2019s account of explanation is an\nimportant feature of causal explanations. Yet the counterfactuals at\nissue cannot be interpreted in terms of interventions or manipulations\non the electron states. Indeed, the fact that the value of the heat\ncapacity of metals follows from structural features of the\nelectrons\u2019 phase space and is not something that, even in\nprinciple, is open to manipulation or control arguably is itself\nexplanatorily relevant. Thus, one might worry that by classifying\nexplanations such as this as causal the causal imperialist obliterates\nwhat is an important distinction between different explanatory\nfunctions and epistemic goals.\n",
