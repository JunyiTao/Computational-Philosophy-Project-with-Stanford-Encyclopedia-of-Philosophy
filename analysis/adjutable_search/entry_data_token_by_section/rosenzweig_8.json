    "main_text": "The New Thinking\n2. The New Thinking\n\n\nIn a series of correspondences during the war, Rosenzweig also began\nto formulate those basic philosophical ideas that would govern his most\nimportant works. Here Rosenzweig articulated a critique of the\nphilosophical tradition culminating in German Idealism, and along with\nit a positive vision of the direction philosophy and theology, in\ntandem, should take in his time. Rosenzweig would later understand\nthese ideas as part of an intellectual project called the \u201cnew\nthinking\u201d which he shared with his closest interlocutors, Eugen\nRosenstock-Huessy, Rudolf Ehrenberg, Hans Ehrenberg, and Viktor von\nWeizs\u00e4cker, and whose core insights had also been reached by\nMartin Buber and Ferdinand Ebner. Drawing from Rosenzweig\u2019s 1925\nessay, \u201cThe New Thinking,\u201d and taking into consideration\nRosenzweig\u2019s varied comments about the \u201cnew thinking\u201d\nin other writings, one can highlight the key ways in which Rosenzweig\nunderstood this \u201cnew thinking\u201d to differ from the\n\u201cold thinking\u201d of the philosophical tradition.\n\n\nRosenzweig understood himself to be living at a transitional moment\nin the history of philosophy. The systems of German Idealism, by\nRosenzweig\u2019s account, brought to completion a 2500-year arc of\nphilosophical thinking initiated by the pre-Socratics. In so doing,\nhowever, they at once brought to light tendencies of the philosophical\ntradition that prevented its representatives from achieving the very\nknowledge they set out to attain. These tendencies of what Rosenzweig\nrefers to as the \u201cold\u201d thinking, include the following:\n\n\nAbstracting from time. In their quest to grasp what is\nuniversally and essentially true, philosophers abstract from the\ntemporal, relational context in which human beings experience the world\naround them. This abstraction that points to what things are\nessentially, Rosenzweig suggests, cannot yield knowledge of things\nas they are. Indeed, such knowing, according to Rosenzweig,\ntakes the pathological case\u2014the case of a being stripped of the\nvery temporal and relational qualities that allow it to be the way it\nis\u2014as what is normal, or as the ideal against which our\nexperience must be measured.\n\nReductive reasoning. The attempt to grasp what things\nare essentially inclines the old thinking to reason out a\nsingle ground for all beings, thereby reducing particular beings to\nsomething other than what they are. Our everyday experience confirms\nfor us, Rosenzweig claims, the fundamental difference between divine,\nworldly, and personal beings. But over the course of the philosophical\ntradition, philosophers have repeatedly sought to reduce these three\nobjects of special metaphysics one to the other, rather than to take\neach up as independent and irreducible. Thus ancient philosophy, by\nRosenzweig\u2019s account, tends to reduce the divine and the human to\naspects of the cosmos; medieval philosophy reduces world and selfhood\nto aspects of the divine; and modern philosophy finds in the human self\nalone the firm ground upon which knowledge of all else is to be\nrooted.\n\nThinking from the Absolute standpoint. The quest for\nthe most comprehensive answer to the \u201cwhat is\u201d question of\nthe philosophical tradition leads the old thinking, in its German\nIdealist manifestation, to aspire to an \u201cAbsolute\u201d\nstandpoint from which the whole of what is\u2014the\n\u201cAll\u201d\u2014can be grasped in its unity. But even if one\nwere to grant the philosopher the possibility of seeing things from the\nstandpoint of the Absolute, such a standpoint would take away from the\nphilosopher the very unique outlook on the actual world which she\npossesses as individual. Moreover, seeking to grasp the whole\nof what is from the Absolute standpoint leads the German Idealist\nphilosopher to grasp particular beings not as they are, but rather as\nmere parts of or manifestations of \u201cthe All.\u201d Grasping such\nparticulars from the perspective of the Absolute hence reduces the\nparticulars qua particulars to nothing.\n\n\n\nFaced with the reductive tendencies of the \u201cold\nthinking\u201d Rosenzweig proposes a \u201cnew thinking\u201d that\npursues knowledge of God, world, and the self in their interrelations,\nfrom out of the individual standpoint of the human being in\ntime.\n\n\nThe new thinker aims to grasp all beings within the \u201cwhole\nhorizon\u201d of her individual standpoint, but her standpoint remains\nthat of an individual human being. She does not transcend her\nindividual, finite standpoint in order to attain a standpoint that\nwould pretend to be Absolute. She does not, according to Rosenzweig,\n\u201chave to take out her own eyes in order to see right.\u201d In\nthis emphasis on the fundamental individuality of the human being,\nRosenzweig sees himself as following in a line of post-Hegelian thought\nbegun by Kierkegaard and Schopenhauer, and epitomized in the life and\nthought of Nietzsche. For only in such thinkers, Rosenzweig claimed,\ndid the individual first cease to be a negligible quantity for\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe new thinker takes the temporal character of human experience\nseriously. Our temporal experience is stamped, Rosenzweig suggests, by\npast, present, and future, and thus our knowledge of the actual is\nmediated through these tenses of time. Before one even begins to\nphilosophize, one finds oneself in a world that is already there; thus\nthe new thinker relates to the things of the world through the prism of\nthe past. The human being experiences her own selfhood as\ncategorically present, and thus the new thinker relates to her\nown self and to the call to selfhood she experiences as present. From\nout of the presence of selfhood, the human being opens up into\nrelations with others, and the new thinker relates to those ultimate\naims which she shares with these others as future. \n\n\nIn its emphasis on temporality, Rosenzweig contends, the new\nthinking breaks away from assumptions about the nature of truth that\ndominate the philosophical tradition. For the new thinking suggests\nthat one does not attain truth by stepping out of the river of time,\nbut rather that truth is that which \u201cunfolds in time.\u201d\nThus, it is not enough to grasp what beings are sub specie\naeternitatis; such beings must be grasped in the nexus of temporal\nrelations in which we experience them.\n\n\nFinally, just as Rosenzweig\u2019s new thinking seeks to reform\nphilosophy\u2019s long-standing assumptions about the object of the\nphilosophical pursuit (truth) and the standpoint out of which the human\nbeing may seek to carry out this pursuit (Absolute or individual), so\nhe suggests that philosophy\u2019s traditional reliance on reason must\nbe qualified in order to attune itself to the temporality of human\nexperience. According to Rosenzweig, if thinking according to reason\nalone runs the risk of reducing all that is to a single ground, it is\nspeech whose fundamental link to the actuality of our temporal\nexperience can serve to temper the reductive excesses of reason. We\narticulate our experience of time through the tenses of our spoken\nlanguage; through language we name the things around us; and it is the\nspoken word through which we enter into actual relations with others.\nInspired by the \u201cnarrative philosophy\u201d to which Schelling\nalludes in the preface to his Ages of the World, and by the\nthought of his contemporary and friend Eugen Rosenstock, Rosenzweig\nthus proposes a form of \u201cspeech-thinking\u201d [see separate\nsection below] as integral to the new thinking\u2019s pursuit of truth\nin time.\n\n\nRosenzweig understands the new thinking to have been made possible\nfor philosophy, in part, by a turn towards theology. Indeed, Rosenzweig\nsuggests that the new philosophical approach towards understanding the\nnature of beings which the new thinking proposes\u2014to wit, that\nour access to knowledge about beings comes not primarily through an\ninquiry into what beings are essentially but rather through serious\nconsideration of the nexus of temporal relations in which we experience\nsuch beings\u2014rests on an insight that is theological at its\nroot. Recall that one of the failings of the \u201cold\nthinking,\u201d according to Rosenzweig, was its tendency to reduce\nthe different kinds of beings to one: grounding the world and the self\nin God, grounding gods and selves in the world, or grounding God and\nworld within the self. But the story theology tells about God, world,\nand the self\u2014and by \u201ctheology\u201d Rosenzweig refers\nquite narrowly to certain dominant trends of Jewish and Christian\ntheology\u2014is not a story about the grounding of any one of these\nfundamental kinds of being in the other, but rather is the story of the\nrelations between God, world, and human being. That is to say,\nthe theology in which Rosenzweig is interested assumes the independent,\nirreducible reality of God, world, and self, and accounts for the\nactuality we experience through the relations between these beings.\nTaking this theological insight as his lead, Rosenzweig proceeds to\nlabel the very threefold temporal experience of actuality through which\nthe new thinking grasps the nexus of relations between beings with\ntheological categories: our experience of the things of the world as\nalready being there in the moment we awaken to our selves is the\nexperience theology describes through its category of creation\nand understands as rooted in a relation between the world of things and\nits divine creator; our experience of being awoken or called to\nselfhood in the present moment is the experience theology describes\nthrough its category of revelation and understands as the\ndivine call to the human self; our experience of the ultimate goal we\nshare with other beings, which we anticipate as future, is the\nexperience theology describes through its category of\nredemption and understands as the vocation placed upon human\nbeings in the world by the divine.\n\n\nIn addition to denoting the narrow relation between God and the\nhuman self, \u201crevelation\u201d for Rosenzweig is the broad\numbrella concept which designates the theological insight which the new\nthinking takes as its lead: if one is to grasp beings as they are, if\none is to grasp truth in its unfolding in time, then one must grasp the\ntrajectory of the relations into which the three fundamental kinds of\nbeings enter spanning from creation to redemption. Revelation amounts\nto the \u201corientation\u201d after which the philosopher has long\nsought, according to Rosenzweig, because it shows the new thinker her\nplace and calling within that trajectory of relations.\n",
