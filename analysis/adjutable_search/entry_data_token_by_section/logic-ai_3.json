Reasoning about Action and Change[21]\n4.1 Priorian Tense Logic\n\n\nTime and temporal reasoning have been associated with logic since the\norigins of scientific logic with Aristotle. The idea of a logic of\ntense in the modern sense has been familiar since at least the work of\nJan \u0141ukasiewicz (see, for instance,\n \u0141ukasiewicz 1970),\n but the shape\nof what is commonly known as tense logic was standardized by Arthur\nPrior\u2019s work in the 1950s and 1960s: see Prior\n 1956,\n 1967,\n 1968.[22]\n As the topic was developed in\nphilosophical logic, tense logic proved to be a species of modal logic;\nPrior\u2019s work was heavily influenced by both Hintikka and Kripke, and by\nthe idea that the truth of tense-logical formulas is relative to\nworld-states or temporal stages of the world; these are the\ntense-theoretic analogues of the timeless possible worlds of ordinary\nmodal logic. Thus, the central logical problems and techniques of tense\nlogic were borrowed from modal logic. For instance, it became a\nresearch theme to work out the relations between axiomatic systems and\nthe corresponding model theoretic constraints on temporal orderings.\nSee, for instance,\n Burgess 1984\n and\n van Benthem 1983.\n\n\nPriorian tense logic shares with modal logic a technical\nconcentration on issues that arise from using the first-order theory of\nrelations to explain the logical phenomena, an expectation that the\nimportant temporal operators will be quantifiers over world-states, and\na rather remote and foundational approach to actual specimens of\ntemporal reasoning. Of course, these temporal logics do yield\nvalidities, such as\nA\u2192PFA\n\n\n(if A, then it was the case that A was going to be\nthe case), which certainly are intuitively valid. But at most, these\ncan only play a broadly foundational role in accounting for realistic\nreasoning about time. It is hard to think of realistic examples in\nwhich they play a leading part. \n\n\nThis characteristic, of course, is one that modal logic shares with\nmost traditional and modern logical theories; the connection with\neveryday reasoning is rather weak. Although modern logical techniques\ndo account with some success for the reasoning involved in verifying\nmathematical proofs and logic puzzles, they do not explain other cases\nof technical or common sense reasoning with much detail or\nplausibility. Even in cases like legal reasoning, where logicians and\nlogically-minded legal theorists have put much effort into formalizing\nthe reasoning, the utility of the results is controversial.\n4.2 Planning Problems and the Situation Calculus\n\n\nPlanning problems provide one of the most fruitful showcases for\ncombining logical analysis with AI applications. On the one hand there\nare many practically important applications of automated planning, and\non the other logical formalizations of planning are genuinely helpful\nin understanding the problems, and in designing algorithms.\n\n\nThe classical representation of an AI planning problem, as described\nin\n Amarel 1968,\n evidently originates in\nearly work of Herbert Simon\u2019s, published in a 1966 CMU technical\nreport,\n Simon 1966.\n In such a problem, an\nagent in an initial world-state is equipped with a set of\nactions, which are thought of as partial functions\ntransforming world-states into world-states. Actions are feasible only\nin world-states that meet certain constraints.  (These constraints are\nnow called the \u201cpreconditions\u201d of the action.)  A planning\nproblem then becomes a search for a series of feasible actions that\nsuccessively transform the initial world-state into a desired\nworld-state.\n\n\nThe Situation Calculus, developed by John McCarthy, is the\norigin of most of the later work in formalizing reasoning about action\nand change. It was first described in 1969, in\n McCarthy 1983;\n the earliest generally\naccessible publication on the topic is\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969.\n\n\nApparently, Priorian tense logic had no influence on\n Amarel 1968.\n But there is no important\ndifference between Amarel\u2019s world-states and those of Priorian tense\nlogic. The \u201csituations\u201d of the Situation Calculus are these same\nworld-states, under a new\n name.[23]\n They resemble possible worlds in\nmodal logic in providing abstract locations that support a consistent\nand complete collection of truths. As in tense logic, these locations\nare ordered, and change is represented by the variation in truths from\none location to another. The crucial difference between the Situation\nCalculus and tense logic is that change in the situation is\ndynamic\u2014changes do not merely occur, but occur for a\nreason.\n\n\nThis difference, of course, is inspired by the intended use of the\nSituation Calculus: it is meant to formalize Simon\u2019s representation of\nthe planning problem, in which a single agent reasons about the\nscenarios in which a series of actions is\n performed.[24]\n In this\nmodel, what drives change is the performance of actions, so the\nfundamental model theoretic relation is the relation\nRESULT(a,s,s\u2032)\n\n\nbetween an action a, an initial situation s in which a is performed,\nand a resulting situation s\u2032 immediately subsequent to the\nperformance of the action. Usually (though this is not absolutely\nnecessary) the deterministic assumption is made that s\u2032 is\nunique. In general, actions can be successfully performed only under\ncertain limited circumstances. This could be modeled by allowing for\ncases in which there is no s\u2032 such that\nRESULT(a,s,s\u2032). But usually, it is assumed that\nRESULT is in fact a total function, but that in cases in\nwhich s does not meet the \u201cpreconditions\u201d of a, there are no\nrestrictions on the s\u2032 satisfying\nRESULT(a,s,s\u2032), so that the causal effects of a\nwill be entirely unconstrained in such cases. \n\n\nA planning problem starts with a limited repertoire of actions\n(where sets of preconditions and effects are associated with each\naction), an initial situation, and a goal (which can be treated as a\nformula). A planning problem is a matter of finding a sequence of\nactions that will achieve the goal, given the initial situation. That\nis, given a goal G and initial situation s, the problem will\nconsist of finding a sequence s1,...,sn of\nactions which will transform s into a final situation that satisfies\nG. This means (assuming that RESULT is a\nfunction) that G will be satisfied by the situation\nsn, where s0 = s and si+1 is\nthe s\u2032 such that\nRESULT(ai+1,si,s\u2032).\nThe planning problem is in effect a search for a sequence of actions\nmeeting these conditions. The success conditions for the search can be\ncharacterized in a formalism like the Situation Calculus, which allows\ninformation about the results of actions to be expressed.\n\n\nNothing has been said up till now about the actual language of the\nSituation Calculus. The crucial thing is how change is to be expressed.\nWith tense logic in mind, it would be natural to invoke a modality like\n[a]A,\n with the truth condition\n\u22a8s[a]A iff\n \u22a8s\u2032A, where\nRESULT(a,s,s\u2032).\n\n\nThis formalization, in the style of dynamic logic, is in fact a leading\ncandidate; see\n Section 4.7,\n below. \n\n\nBut\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969\n deploys a language that is much closer to first-order logic.\n(This formalization style is characteristic of McCarthy\u2019s work; see\n McCarthy 1979.)\n Actions are treated as\nindividuals. And certain propositions whose truth values can change\nover time (propositional fluents) are also treated as\nindividuals. Where s is a situation and f is a fluent,\nHolds(f,s) says that f is true in s.\n4.3 Formalizing Microworlds\n\n\nSince the pioneering work of the nineteenth and early twentieth\ncentury logicians, the process of formalizing mathematical domains has\nlargely become a matter of routine. Although (as with set theory) there\nmay be controversies about what axioms and logical infrastructure best\nserve to formalize an area of mathematics, the methods of formalization\nand the criteria for evaluating them are relatively unproblematic. This\nmethodological clarity has not been successfully extended to other\ndomains; even the formalization of the empirical sciences presents\ndifficult problems that have not yet been\n resolved.[25]\n\n\n The formalization of temporal reasoning, and in particular of\nreasoning about actions and plans, is the best-developed successful\nextension of modern formalization techniques to domains other than\nmathematical theories.  This departure has required the creation of\nnew methodologies.  One methodological innovation will emerge in\n Section 4.5:\nthe development of a library of scenarios for\ntesting the adequacy of various formalisms, and the creation of\nspecialized domains like the blocks-world domain (mentioned above,\nin Section 4.2) that serve a laboratories for testing ideas. \nFor more on the blocks world, see\n Genesereth & Nilsson 1987;\n Davis 1991.\n McCarthy\u2019s ideas about\nelaboration tolerance\nMcCarthy 1999\n provide one interesting attempt to provide a criterion for the\nadequacy of formalizations. Another idea that has emerged in the course of\nformalizing common sense domains is the importance of an explicit\nontology; see, for instance,\n Fikes 1996 and\n Lenat & Guha 1989.\n Another is the potential usefulness of explicit\nrepresentations of context; see\n Guha, 1991.\n  Another is the use of simulation techniques: see,\nfor instance, \n Johnstone & Williamson 2007\n\n4.4 Prediction and the Frame Problem\n\n\nTo tell whether a plan achieves its goal, you need to see whether\nthe goal holds in the plan\u2019s final state. Doing this requires\npredictive reasoning, a type of reasoning that was neglected\nin the tense-logical literature. As in mechanics, prediction involves\nthe inference of later states from earlier ones. But (in the case of\nsimple planning problems at least) the dynamics are determined by\nactions rather than by differential equations. The investigation of\nthis qualitative form of temporal reasoning, and of related sorts of\nreasoning (e.g., plan recognition, which seeks to infer goals from\nobserved actions, and narrative explanation, which seeks to fill in\nimplicit information in a temporal narrative) is one of the most\nimpressive chapters in the brief history of common sense logicism.\n\n\nThe essence of prediction is the problem of inferring what holds in\nthe situation that ensues from performing an action, given information\nabout the initial situation. It is often assumed that the agent has complete\nknowledge about the initial situation\u2014this assumption is usual in\nclassical formalizations of \nplanning.[26]\n\n\nA large part of the qualitative dynamics that is needed for planning\nconsists in inferring what does not change. Take a simple plan\nto type the word \u2018cat\u2019 using word processing software: \nthe natural plan is to first enter \u2018c\u2019, then enter \u2018a\u2019,\nthen enter \u2018t\u2019. Part of one\u2019s confidence in this plan is that\nthe actions are independent: for instance, entering \u2018a\u2019\ndoes not also erase the \u2018c\u2019. The required inference can be\nthought of as a form of inertia. The Frame Problem is\nthe problem of how to formalize the required inertial reasoning.\n\n\nThe Frame Problem was named and introduced in\n McCarthy & Hayes 1969.\nUnlike most of the philosophically interesting technical problems to\nemerge in AI, it has attracted the interest of philosophers; most of\nthe relevant papers, and background information, can be found in\n Ford & Pylyshyn 1996;\n Pylyshyn 1987.\n Both of these volumes\ndocument interactions between AI and philosophy.\n\n\nThe quality of these interactions is discouraging. Like any realistic\ncommon sense reasoning problem, the Frame Problem is open-ended, and\ncan depend on a wide variety of circumstances. If you put $20 in a\nwallet, put the wallet in your pocket, and go to the store, you can\nsafely assume that the $20 is still in the wallet.  But if you leave the\n$20 on the counter at the store while shopping, you can\u2019t safely\nassume it will be there later.  This may account for the\ntemptation that makes some \nphilosophers[27]\n want to construe the Frame Problem\nvery broadly, so that very soon it becomes indiscernible from the\nproblem of formalizing general common sense in arbitrary domains. Such\na broad construal may serve to introduce speculative discussions\nconcerning the nature of AI, but it loses all contact with the\ngenuine, new logical problems in temporal reasoning that have been\ndiscovered by the AI community. It provides a forum for repeating some\nfamiliar philosophical themes, but it brings nothing new to\nphilosophy. This way of interpreting the Frame Problem is disappointing, because\nphilosophy can use all the help it can get; the AI community has\nsucceeded in extending and enriching the application of logic to\ncommon sense reasoning in dramatic ways that are highly relevant to\nphilosophy. The clearest account of these developments to be found in\nthe volumes edited by Pylyshyn is\n Morgenstern 1996.\n An extended treatment can be found in\n Shanahan 1997;\n also see\n Sandewall 1994 and\n Shanahan 2009.\n\n The purely logical Frame Problem can be solved using monotonic logic,\nby simply writing explicit axioms stating what does not\nchange when an action is performed. This technique can be successfully\napplied to quite complex formalization\nproblems.[28]\nBut nonmonotonic solutions to the framework have been\nextensively investigated and deployed; these lead to new and\ninteresting lines of logical development.\n\n\nSome philosophers\n (Fodor 1987,\n Lormand 1996)\n have felt that contrived\npropositions will pose special difficulties in connection with the\nFrame Problem. As Shanahan points out\n Shanahan 1997\n [p.\u00a024]) Fodor\u2019s\n\u201cfridgeon\u201d example is readily formalized in the Situation Calculus and\nposes no special problems. However, as Lormand suggests, Goodman\u2019s\nexamples\n Goodman, 1946\n do create\nproblems if they are admitted as fluents; there will be anomalous\nextensions in which objects change from green to blue in order to\npreserve their grueness.\n\n\nThis is one of the few points about the Frame Problem made by a philosopher \nthat raises a genuine difficulty for\nthe formal solutions. But the difficulty is peripheral, since the\nexample is not realistic. Recall that fluents are represented as\nfirst-order individuals. Although fluents are situation-dependent\nfunctions, an axiom of comprehension is certainly not assumed for\nfluents. In fact, it is generally supposed that the domain of fluents\nwill be a very limited set of the totality of situation-dependent\nfunctions; typically, it will be a relatively small finite set of\nvariables representing features of the domain considered to be\nimportant.  In particular cases these will be chosen in much the same\nway that a set of variables is chosen in statistical modeling.\n\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a systematic account in the AI literature of\nhow to choose an appropriate set of fluents, but it would certainly be\npart of such an account that all fluents should correspond to\nprojectable predicates, in Goodman\u2019s sense.\n4.5 Nonmonotonic Treatments of Inertia and a \nPackage of Problems\n\n\nThe idea behind nonmonotonic solutions to the Frame Problem is to\ntreat inertia as a default; changes are assumed to occur only if there\nis some special reason for them to occur. In an action-centered account\nof change, this means that absence of change is assumed when an action\nis performed unless a reason for the change can be found in axioms for\nthe action.\n\n\nFor explicitness, let\u2019s use Reiter\u2019s default logic to illustrate\nthe formalization. Recall that in Reiter\u2019s theory, defaults are\nrepresented as rules, not formulas, so that they are not subject to\nquantification. To formalize inertia, then, we need to use default rule\nschemata. For each fluent f, action a, and situation s, the set of\nthese schemata will include an instance of the following schema:\n\n\n\nIR(f, a, s) \u00a0 \n\n  T\u00a0:\u00a0Holds(f,s) \u2194 Holds(f,RESULT(a,s))\n\n\nHolds(f,s) \u2194 Holds(f,RESULT(a,s))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way of doing things makes any case in which a fluent changes\ntruth value a prima facie anomaly. But it follows from\nReiter\u2019s account of extensions that such defaults are overridden when\nthey conflict with the monotonic theory of situation dynamics. So if,\nfor instance, there is a monotonic causal axiom for the action\nblacken ensuring that blackening a block will make it black in\nthe resulting situation, then the appropriate instance of\nIR will be inefficacious, and there will be no\nextension in which a white block remains white when it is\nblackened.\n\n\nThe Frame Problem somehow managed to capture the attention of a wide\ncommunity\u2014but if one is interested in understanding the complex\nproblems that arise in generalizing formalisms like the Situation\nCalculus, while at the same time ensuring that they deliver plausible\nsolutions to a wide variety of scenarios, it is more useful to consider\na larger range of problems. For the AI community, the larger problems\ninclude the Frame Problem itself, the Qualification Problem, the\nRamification Problem, generalizability along a number of important\ndimensions including incomplete information, concurrency (multiple\nagents), and continuous change, and finally a large assortment of\nspecific challenges such as the scenarios mentioned later in this\nsection.\n\n\nThe Qualification Problem arises generally in connection\nwith the formalization of common sense generalizations. Typically,\nthese involve exceptions, and these exceptions\u2014especially if\none is willing to entertain far-fetched circumstances\u2014can\niterate endlessly. The same phenomenon, under a label like \u2018the\nproblem of ceteris paribus generalizations\u2019, is familiar\nfrom analytic philosophy. It also comes up in the semantics of\ngeneric constructions found in natural languages.[29] In a sense, this\nproblem is addressed at a general level by nonmonotonic logics,\nwhich\u2014though they do not provide a way to enumerate\nexceptions\u2014do allow common sense generalizations to be\nformulated as defaults, as well as enabling further qualifications to\nbe added nondestructively. Ideally, then, the initial generalization\ncan be stated as an axiom and qualifications can be added\nincrementally in the form of further axioms.\n\n\nThe Qualification Problem was raised in\n McCarthy 1986,\n where it was motivated\nchiefly by generalizations concerning the consequences of actions;\nMcCarthy considers in some detail the generalization that turning the\nignition key in an automobile will start the car. Much the same point,\nin fact, can be made about virtually any action, including stacking one\nblock on another\u2014the standard action that is used to illustrate\nthe Situation Calculus. A circumscriptive approach to the Qualification\nProblem is presented in\n Lifschitz 1987;\nthis explicitly introduces the precondition relation between an action\nand its preconditions into the formalism, and circumscriptively\nminimizes preconditions, eliminating from preferred models any \u201cunknown\npreconditions\u201d that might render an action inefficacious.\n\n\nSeveral dimensions of the Qualification Problem remain as broad,\nchallenging research problems. For one thing, not every nonmonotonic\nlogic provides graceful mechanisms for qualification. Default logic,\nfor instance, does not deliver the intuitively desired conclusions.\nSuppose one formalizes the common sense generalization that if you press\nthe \u2018a\u2019 key on a computer it will type \u2018a\u2019 as\na normal default:\n\n\n  T\u2009:\u2009VALUE(text, RESULT(Press-a,s)) = VALUE(text,s) + \u2018a\u2019\n\n\n  VALUE(text, RESULT(Press-a,s)) = VALUE(text,s) + \u2018a\u2019\n\n\n\n\nIf we then formalize the exception to this generalization that if you\npress the \u2018a\u2019 key while the Alt key is depressed the\ncursor moves to the beginning of the current sentence as a normal\ndefault along the same lines, we get two extensions: one in\nwhich pressing \u2018a\u2019 while the Alt key is depressed moves\nthe cursor and another in which it adds \u2018a\u2019 to the\ntext.\n\n\nThe problem is that default logic does not provide for more specific\ndefaults to override ones that are more general. This principle of\nspecificity has been discussed at length in the literature.\nIncorporating it in a nonmonotonic logic can complicate the theory\nconsiderably; see, for instance,\n Asher & Morreau 1991\n and\n Horty 1994.\n And,\nas\n Elkan 1995\n points out, the Qualification\nProblem raises computational issues. \n\n\nRelatively little attention has been given to the Qualification\nProblem for characterizing actions, in comparison with other problems\nin temporal reasoning. In particular, the standard accounts of\nunsuccessful actions are somewhat unintuitive. In the\nformalization of\n Lifschitz 1987,\n for instance, actions with some unsatisfied preconditions are only\ndistinguished from actions whose preconditions all succeed in that\nthe conventional effects of the action will only be ensured when the\npreconditions are met. It is as if an action of spending $1,000,000\ncan be performed at any moment\u2014although if you don\u2019t have the\nmoney, no effects in particular will be guaranteed. \n [30] And there\nis no distinction between actions that cannot even be attempted (like\nboarding a plane in London when you are in Sydney), actions that can\nbe attempted, but in which the attempt can be expected to go wrong\n(like making a withdrawal when you have insufficient funds), actions\nthat can be attempted with reasonable hope of success, and actions\nthat can be attempted with guaranteed success. As J.L. Austin made\nclear in\n Austin 1961,\n the ways in which actions can be\nattempted, and in which attempted actions can fail, are a well\ndeveloped part of common sense reasoning. Obviously, in contemplating a\nplan containing actions that may fail, one may need to reason about the\nconsequences of failure. Formalizing the pathology of actions,\nproviding a systematic theory of ways in which actions and the plans\nthat contain them can go wrong, would be a useful addition to planning\nformalisms, and one that would illuminate important themes in\nphilosophy.\n\n\nThe challenge posed by the Ramification Problem\n(characterized first in\n Finger 1987)\n is\nto formalize the indirect consequences of actions, where \u201cindirect\u201d\neffects are not\n delayed,[31]\n but are temporally immediate but causally derivative. If one walks into\na room, the direct effect is that one is now in the room. There are also\nmany indirect effects: for instance, that one\u2019s shirt also is now in the\nroom.\n\n\n You can see from this that the formulation of the problem\npresupposes a distinction between direct consequences of actions (ones\nthat attach directly to an action, and that are ensured by the\nsuccessful performance of the action) and other consequences. This\nassumption is generally accepted without question in the AI literature\non action formalisms. You can make a good case for its common sense\nplausibility\u2014for instance, many of our words for actions\n(\u2018to warm\u2019, to \u2018lengthen\u2019, \u2018to\nensure\u2019) are derived from the effects that are conventionally\nassociated with them. And in these cases, success is entailed: if\nsomeone has warmed something, this entails that it became warm.\n[32] A typical\nexample is discussed in\n Lin 1995:\na certain suitcase has two locks, and is open if and only if both locks\nare open. Then (assuming that actions are not performed concurrently)\nopening one lock will open the suitcase if and only if the other lock\nis open. Here, opening a lock is an action, with direct consequences;\nopening a suitcase is not an action, it is an indirect effect.\n\n\nObviously, the Ramification Problem is intimately connected with the\nFrame Problem. In approaches that adopt nonmonotonic solutions to the\nFrame Problem, inertial defaults will need to be overridden by\nconclusions about ramifications in order to obtain correct results. In\ncase the left lock of the suitcase is open, for instance, and an action\nof opening the right lock is performed, then the default conclusion\nthat the suitcase remains closed needs somehow to be suppressed. Some\napproaches to the Ramification Problem depend on the development of\ntheories of common sense causation, and therefore are closely related\nto the causal approaches to reasoning about time and action discussed\nbelow in\n Section 4.6.\n See, for\n instance,\n Giunchiglia et al. 1997,\n Thielscher 1989,\n Lin 1995.\n\n\nPhilosophical logicians have been content to illustrate their ideas\nwith relatively small-scale examples. The formalization of even\nlarge-scale mathematical theories is relatively unproblematic. Logicist\nAI is the first branch of logic to undertake the task of formalizing\nlarge examples involving nontrivial common sense reasoning. In doing\nso, the field has had to invent new methods. An important part of the\nmethodology that has emerged in formalizing action and change is the\nprominence that is given to challenges, posed in the form of\nscenarios. These scenarios represent formalization problems\nwhich usually involve relatively simple, realistic examples designed to\nchallenge the logical theories in specific ways. Typically, there will\nbe clear common sense intuitions about the inferences that should be\ndrawn in these cases. The challenge is to design a logical formalism\nthat will provide general, well-motivated solutions to these benchmark\nproblems.\n\n\nAmong the many scenarios that have been discussed in the literature\nare the Baby Scenario, the Bus Ride Scenario, the Chess Board Scenario,\nthe Ferryboat Connection Scenario, the Furniture Assembly Scenario, the\nHiding Turkey Scenario, the Kitchen Sink Scenario, the Russian Turkey\nScenario, the Stanford Murder Mystery, the Stockholm Delivery Scenario,\nthe Stolen Car Scenario, the Stuffy Room Scenario, the Ticketed Car\nScenario, the Walking Turkey Scenario, and the Yale Shooting Anomaly.\nAccounts of these can be found in\n Shanahan 1997\n and\n Sandewall 1994;\n see\nespecially\n Sandewall 1994[Chapters\u00a02\n and 7].\n\n\nMany of these scenarios are designed to test advanced problems that\nwill not be discussed here\u2014for instance, challenges dealing with\nmultiple agents, or with continuous changes. Here, we concentrate\non one of the earliest, and probably the most subtle of these\nscenarios: the Yale Shooting Anomaly, first reported in\n Hanks & McDermott 1985\n and\npublished in\n Hanks & McDermott 1986;\n Hanks & McDermott 1987.\n\n\nThe Yale Shooting Anomaly involves three actions: load,\nshoot, and wait. A propositional fluent\nLoaded tracks whether a certain pistol is loaded; another\nfluent, Alive, tracks whether a certain person, Fred, is\nalive. load has no preconditions; its only effect is\nLoaded. The fluent shoot has Loaded as its\nonly precondition and Alive as a negative effect;\nwait has no preconditions and no effects.\n\n\nCausal information regarding the axioms is formalized as\nfollows.\n\n\nLoad\n\u2200sHolds(Loaded,\nRESULT(load,s))\n\n\nShoot 1\n\u2200s[Holds(Loaded,s) \u2192\nHolds(\u00acAlive,\nRESULT(shoot,s))]\n\n\nShoot 2\n\u2200s[Holds(Loaded,s) \u2192\nHolds(\u00acLoaded,\nRESULT(shoot,s))]\n\n\n\n\nThere is no Wait Axiom\u2014that is, wait has no\npreconditions and no effects.\n\n\nWe will formalize the inertial reasoning in this scenario using a\nnonmonotonic logic\u2014to be specific, we use Reiter\u2019s default logic.\nThe set D of defaults for this theory consists of all\ninstances of the inertial schema IR. In the initial\nsituation, Fred is alive and the pistol is unloaded.\n\n\n\nIC1\nHolds(Alive,s0)\n\n\nIC2\n\u00acHolds(Loaded,s0)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe monotonic theory W of the scenario consists of: (1) the\naction axioms Load, Shoot 1 and\nShoot 2 and (2) the initial conditions\nIC1 and IC2. Let s1 =\nRESULT(load,s0), s2 =\nRESULT(wait,s1), and s3 =\nRESULT(shoot,s2). \n\n\nThe Yale Shooting Anomaly arises because this theory\nallows an extension in which the actions are load;\nshoot; wait, and in the final situation\ns3, the pistol is unloaded and Fred is alive. The\ninitial situation in the Anomaly and the three actions, with their\nresulting situations, can be pictured as follows.\n\n\n\ns0\nload\n\n \u2192\ns1\nwait\n\n \u2192\ns2\nshoot\n\n \u2192\ns3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural, expected outcome of these axioms is that the pistol is\nloaded and Fred is alive after waiting, so that shooting yields a final\noutcome in which Fred is not alive and the pistol is unloaded. There is\nno problem in showing that this corresponds to an extension; the\nproblem is the presence of the other, anomalous extension, which looks\nlike this.\n\n\n\nAlive\n\n\u00acLoaded\n\ns0\nload\n\n \u2192 \nAlive\n\nLoaded\n\ns1\nwait\n\n \u2192\nAlive\n\n\u00acLoaded\n\ns2\nshoot\n\n \u2192\nAlive\n\n\u00acLoaded\n\ns3\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a narrative version of this extension. At first, Fred is\nalive and the pistol is unloaded. After loading, the pistol is loaded\nand Fred remains alive. After waiting, the pistol becomes unloaded and\nFred remains alive. Shooting is then vacuous since the pistol is\nunloaded, so finally, after shooting, Fred remains alive and the pistol\nremains unloaded.\n\n\nThe best way to see clearly that this is an extension is to work\nthrough the proof. Less formally, though, you can see that the expected\nextension violates just one default: the frame default for\nAlive is violated when Fred changes state in the last step.\nBut the anomalous extension also violates only one default: the frame\ndefault for Loaded is violated when the pistol spontaneously\nbecomes unloaded while waiting. So, if you just go by the number of\ndefaults that are violated, both extensions are equally good.\n\n\nThe Yale Shooting Anomaly represents a major obstacle in developing\na theory of predictive reasoning. A plausible, well-motivated logical\nsolution to the Frame Problem runs afoul of a simple, crisp example in\nwhich it clearly delivers the wrong results. Naturally, the literature\nconcerning the Yale Shooting Problem is extensive. Surveys of some of\nthis work, with bibliographical references, can be found in\n Shanahan 1997;\n Morgenstern 1996.\n4.6 Some Emergent Frameworks\n\n\nMany formalisms have been proposed to deal with the problems\nsurveyed in the previous section. Some are more or less neglected\ntoday. Several are still advocated and defended by leading experts;\nsome of these are associated with research groups who are not only\ninterested in developments of logical theory, but in applications in\nplanning and cognitive robotics.\n\n\nThe leading approaches provide solutions to the main problems\nmentioned in\n Section 4.5,\n and to many of the\nscenarios designed to test and illustrate theories of reasoning about\naction and change. It is commonly agreed that good solutions need to be\ngeneralizable to more complex cases than the early planning formalisms,\nand that in particular the solutions they offer should be deployable\neven when continuous time, concurrent actions, and various kinds of\nignorance are allowed. Also, it is generally agreed that the formalisms\nshould support several kinds of reasoning, and, in particular, not only\nprediction and plan verification but retrodiction, i.e.,\nconstruction of a sequence of states and actions from partial\ninformation, presented in narrative form.\n\n\nWe describe four approaches here: (1) Features and fluents\n(Sandewall), (2) Motivated Action Theory (Morgenstern and Stein), (3)\nState Minimization in the Event Calculus (Shanahan) and (4) Causal\nTheories (Lifschitz and others). The accounts of the first three in\nwhat follows will be fairly brief; fortunately, each approach is well\ndocumented in a single reference. The fourth approach is most likely\nto be interesting to philosophers and to contain elements that will be\nof lasting importance regardless of future developments in this\narea.\n4.6.1 Features and fluents\n\n\nThis approach, described in\n Sandewall 1994,\n uses preference semantics as a way to organize nonmonotonic\nsolutions to the problems of reasoning about action and change. Rather\nthan introducing a single logical framework, Sandewall considers a\nnumber of temporal logics, including ones that use discrete,\ncontinuous, and branching time. The properties of the logics are\nsystematically tested against a large suite of test scenarios. \n4.6.2 Motivated Action Theory\n\n\nThis theory grew out of direct consideration of the problems in\ntemporal reasoning described above in\n Section 4.5,\n and especially the Yale Shooting Scenario. In\n Morgenstern & Stein 1994,\nMorgenstern and Stein seek to find a general, intuitively motivated\nlogical framework that solves the difficulties. They settle on the idea\nthat unmotivated actions are to be minimized, where an action\n(\u201cactions\u201d construed generally enough to include any change) can be\nmotivated directly, e.g. by an axiom, or indirectly, through chains of\nmotivations. The key technical idea of the paper is a (rather\ncomplicated) definition of motivation in an interval-based temporal\nlogic. In\n Morgenstern 1996,\nMorgenstern presents a summary of the theory, along with reasons for\nrejecting its causal rivals. The most important of these reasons is\nthat these theories, based on the Situation Calculus, do not appear to\ngeneralize to cases allowing for concurrency and ignorance. She also\ncites the failure of early causal theories to deal with retrodiction. \n4.6.3 State-Based Minimization in the Event Calculus\n\n\nIn\n Baker 1989,\n Andrew Baker presented a\nsolution to the version of the Yale Shooting problem in the Situation\nCalculus, using a circumscriptive inertial axiom. The very brief\naccount of circumscription above in\n Section 3\nindicated that circumscription uses preferred models in which the\nextensions of certain predicates are minimized. In the course of this\nminimization, a set of parameters (including, of course, the predicates\nto be minimized) is allowed to vary; the rest are held constant. Which\nparameters vary and which are held constant is determined by the\napplication. \n\n\nIn the earliest circumscriptive solutions to the Frame Problem, the\ninertial rule CIR is stated using an abnormality\npredicate.\nCIR \n\u2200f\u2200s\u2200a[\u00acAb(f,a,s) \u2192\n[Holds(f,s) \u2194\nHolds(f,RESULT(a,s))]]\n\n\n\nThis axiom uses a biconditional, so that it can be used for\nretrodiction; this is typical of the more recent formulations of common\nsense inertia. In circumscribing, the abnormality predicate is\nminimized while the Holds predicate is allowed to vary and all\nother parameters are fixed. This formalization succumbs to the Yale\nShooting Anomaly in much the same way that default logic does.\n(Circumscription does not involve multiple extensions, so the problem\nemerges as the nonderivability of the conclusion that Fred is alive\nafter the occurrence of the shooting.)\n\n\nIn Baker\u2019s reformulation of the problem, separate axioms ensure the\nexistence of a situation corresponding to each Boolean combination of\nfluents, and the RESULT function is allowed to vary,\nwhile the Holds predicate is held constant. In this setting,\nthe RESULT function needs to be specified for\n\u201ccounterfactual\u201dactions\u2014in particular, for shooting as well as\nfor waiting in the Yale Shooting Anomaly. It is this feature that\neliminates the incorrect model for that scenario; for details, see\n Baker 1989\n and\n Shanahan 1997,\n Chapter 6.\n\n\nThis idea, which Shanahan calls \u201cState-Based Minimization,\u201d is\ndeveloped and extended in\n Shanahan 1997,\nin the context of a temporal logic deriving from the Event Calculus of\nKowalski and Sergot; see\n Kowalski & Sergot 1986.\n Shanahan\u2019s formalism has the advantage of being\nclosely connected to implementations using logic programming.\n4.6.4 Causal Theories\n\n\nRecall that in the anomalous model of the Yale Shooting Scenario the\ngun becomes unloaded after the performance of the wait action,\nan action which has no conventional effects\u2014the unloading, then,\nis uncaused. In the context of a nonmonotonic logic\u2014and without\nsuch a logic, the Yale Shooting Anomaly would not arise\u2014it is\nvery natural to formalize this by treating uncaused eventualities as\nabnormalities to be minimized. \n\n\nThis strategy was pursued by Hector Geffner in\n Geffner 1992\n1990,\n where he formalizes this simple causal\nsolution to the Yale Shooting Anomaly. But the solution is presented in\nthe context of an ambitious general project in nonmonotonic logic that\nnot only develops properties of the preferred model approach and shows\nhow to apply it to a number of reasoning problems, but that relates\nnonmonotonic logic to probabilities, using ideas deriving from\n Adams 1975.\n In\n Geffner 1992,\n the causal theory is sketched;\nit is not developed to show its adequacy in dealing with the battery of\nproblems presented above, and in particular the Ramification Problem is\nleft untouched.\n\n\nThe work beginning with\n Lifschitz 1987\n has contributed to a sustained line of research in the causal\napproach\u2014not only by Lifschitz and students of his such as Enrico\nGiunchiglia and Hudson Turner, but by researchers at other sites. For\nwork in this area, and further references, see\n Thielscher 1989,\n Gustaffson & Doherty 1996,\n Baral 1995,\n Nakashima et al. 1997,\n Lifschitz 1997,\n Giunchiglia & Lifschitz 1998,\n Lin 1995,\n Haugh 1987,\n Lifschitz 1998,\n Turner 1999,\n McCain & Turner 1995,\n Elkan 1991,\n McCain & Turner 1997,\n Thielscher 1996,\n and\n Gelfond & Lifschitz 1998.\n\n\nHere, we briefly describe some of theories developed by the\nTexas Action Group, leading up to the causal solution presented in\n Turner 1999.\n Turner returns to the ideas\n of\n Geffner 1992,\n but places them in a simpler\nlogical setting and applies them to the formalization of more complex\nscenarios that illustrate the interactions of causal inertia with other\nconsiderations, especially the Ramification Problem.\n\n\nRamification is induced by the presence of static laws\nwhich relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes. \nLet\u2019s use a car-starting scenario to illustrate the difficulties. There\nis one action, turn-on, which turns on the ignition; let\u2019s\nsuppose that this action has no preconditions. There is a fluent\nIg tracking whether the ignition is on, a fluent Dead\ntracking whether the battery is dead, and a fluent Run\ntracking whether the engine is running. A static law says that if the\nignition is on and the battery isn\u2019t dead, the engine is running.\n(Let\u2019s suppose that every other source of failure has already been\neliminated in this scenario; the only possible reason for not starting\nis the battery.) We want to consider a transition in which\nturn-on is performed in a situation in which the ignition is\nnot on, the battery is not dead, and the car isn\u2019t running.\n\n\nOf course, we want a planning agent to be able to infer in such a\ncase that a performance of turn-on will result in a situation\nin which the ignition is on, the battery isn\u2019t dead, and the engine is\nrunning. But contraposition of laws makes it difficult to devise a\nprincipled solution. Informally, this difficulty is this: we can\nconclude by contraposing our only static law that if the ignition is on\nand the engine isn\u2019t running, then the battery is dead. This law not\nonly is true in our scenario, but would be used to explain a failed\nattempt to start the car. But if we allow it to be used for prediction,\nthen it is hard to see how to rule out an outcome of turn-on\nin which the ignition is on, the battery is dead, and the engine isn\u2019t\nrunning. The battery is dead in this outcome because of causal inertia.\nThe engine isn\u2019t running because of the contraposed causal law.\n\n\nReaders who want to explore in some detail the\nproblems of embedding a nonmonotonic solution to the Frame Problem in\nrelatively expressive action languages  can look to\n Gelfond & Lifschitz 1998.\nThis paper presents an\nincreasingly powerful and sophisticated series of action languages.\nTheir language incorporates an ad hoc or at least purely\nsyntactic solution to the Ramification Problem.\n\n\nA theory in language\n B\n consists of\ntwo sets of axioms:\n\nStatic laws of the form F\u2192L, where\nL is a literal and F is a conjunction of literals or\nis T.\nDynamic laws of the form A Causes\nL if F, where A is an\naction term and F is a boolean formula.\n\n\n\nGelfond and Lifschitz impose a weak closure condition on static\nlaws: where s is a set of literals, s is\nrestricted-closed with respect to a\n B theory\n T,\n RBClT(s)\nif and only\nif every literal that would be added by starting with s and\nforward-chaining through the static laws of\n B\n is already in s. In other words:\nRBClT(s) \niff for all\nstatic laws F\u2192L of T, if s\nentails F then L\u2208s.\n\n\nThe closure operation induced by this condition is used in defining\nRESULT(a,s) for the language\n B.\n Of course, this solution treats logically equivalent\nstatic laws differently; for instance, a theory whose only static law\nis [P\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u00acQ] \u2192R will in general\ndetermine a very different RESULT function than one\nwhose only static law is [P\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u00acR] \u2192Q.\n\n\nThis has some somewhat counterintuitive effects. In the car-starting\nscenario, Gelfond and Lifschitz\u2019 language\n B\n indeed yields the desired conclusion that the car will\nstart when there is one dynamic law,\n\nturn-on\u00a0Causes\u00a0Ig\u00a0\nif\u00a0T,\n\n\nwhen the only static law is \n[Ig\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u00acDead] \u2192 Run,\n\n\nwhen the initial state is s = {\u00acIg,\n\u00acDead, \u00acRun}, and when the action\nturn-on is performed. \n\n\nHowever, if we add a true static law saying that if the ignition is\non and the engine isn\u2019t running the battery is dead, we get an anomaly.\nWith the addition of this law, there is a model in which preserving the\nfact that the car is not running makes the battery become dead when the\nignition is turned on.\n\n\nIf the two static laws,\n[Ig\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u00acDead] \u2192 Run\nand [Ig\u00a0\u2227\u00a0\u00acRun]\n\u2192 Dead, are reformulated using causal language, the\nformer sounds correct, while the second is distinctly problematic:\ncompare\nIf the battery isn\u2019t dead, the ignition\u2019s being on will\ncause the engine to run.\n\n\nwith \nIf the engine isn\u2019t running, the ignition\u2019s being on will\ncause the battery to be dead.\n\n\nThis makes it very plausible to suppose that the source of the\nproblem is a representation of underlying causal information in action\nlanguage\n B\n that is somehow\ninadequate.\n\n\nGelfond and Lifschitz go on to describe another action\n language,\n C, which invokes an explicit notion of\ncausality\u2014motivated, in all likelihood, in part by the need to provide a\nmore principled solution to the problem. Instead of describing that\nlanguage, we now discuss the similar theory of\n Turner 1999.\n\n\nTurner\u2019s idea is to treat Caused as a modal operator\n[\u00a0c\u00a0], making this the\nbasis of a modal nonmonotonic logic. In the preferred models of this\nlogic, the caused propositions coincide with the propositions that are\ntrue, and this must be the only possibility consistent with the\nextensional part of the model. To make this more explicit, recall that\nin the possible worlds interpretation of S5, it is\npossible to identify possible worlds with state descriptions,\nwhich we can represent as sets I of literals (atomic formulas\nand their negations). Making this identification, then, we can think of\na model as a pair <I, S>, where S is a\nset of interpretations (complete, consistent sets of literals)\nincluding I. The modal operator\n[\u00a0c\u00a0] is given the\nstandard semantics: where S is a set of interpretations and\nwhere I\u00a0\u2208\u00a0S, \nS\u00a0\u22a8I\u00a0[\u00a0c\u00a0\n]\u00a0A if and only if \nS\u00a0\u22a8I\u2032\u00a0A for all\nI\u2032\u00a0\u2208S. <I, S>\nsatisfies a set of formulas T if and only if\nS\u00a0\u22a8I\u00a0A for all\nA\u00a0\u2208\u00a0T.\n\n\nTurner\u2019s preferred models of T are the pairs\n<I, S> such that: (1) <I,\nS> satisfies T, (2) S = {I}, and\n(3) <I, S> is the unique interpretation\n<I\u2032, S\u2032> meeting conditions (1) and\n(2) with I\u2032 = I. Condition (2) guarantees the\n\u201cuniversality of causation\u201d; it validates A \u2194\n[\u00a0c\u00a0]A.\nCondition (3) \u201cgrounds\u201d causality in noncausal information (in the\nmodels in which we are interested, this will be information about the\noccurrence of events), in the strongest sense: it is uniquely\ndetermined by this information.\n\n\nAlthough it is not evident from the formulation, Turner\u2019s account of\npreferred models is related to the constructions of more general\nnonmonotonic logics, such as default logic. Consult\n Turner 1999\n for details.\n\n\nThe axioms that specify the effects of actions treat these effects\nas caused; for instance, the axiom schema for loading would read as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nCausal-Load\n\n[\u00a0c\u00a0]Holds(load,\n RESULT(load, s))[33]\n\n\n\n\n\nRamifications of the immediate effects of actions are also treated as\ncaused. And the nonmonotonic inertial axiom schemata take the form \n\n[[[\u2009c\u2009]Holds(f,s)]\n \u2227\nHolds(f,RESULT(a,s))] \u2192\n[\u2009c\u2009]Holds(f,R\nESULT(a,s))\n\nand \n\n[[[\u2009c\u2009]\u00acHolds(f,s)]\n \u2227\n\u00acHolds(f,RESULT(a,s))] \u2192 \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \n  [\u2009c\u2009]\u00acHolds(f,RESULT(a,s)).\n\n\n\nThus, a true proposition can be caused either because it is the direct\nor indirect effect of an action, or because it involves the persistence\nof a caused proposition. Initial conditions are also considered to be\ncaused, by stipulation. \n\n\nTo illustrate the workings of this approach, let\u2019s consider the\nsimplest case of inertia: we have a language with just one constant\ndenoting a fluent, f, and one action-denoting constant, wait.\nAs in the Yale Shooting Problem, there are no axioms for wait;\nthis action can always be performed and has no associated effects. Let\ns1 be RESULT(wait,s\n0). The theory T contains an initial condition for\nf, Holds(f,s0) and a statement that the initial\ncondition is caused,\n[\u2009c\u2009]\u2009Holds(f,s\n0), as well as the inertial schemata.\n\n\nTwo models of T satisfy conditions (1) and (2):\n\nM1 =\n<I1,{I1}> and\nM2 =\n<I2,{I2}>,\n\nwhere\nI1 = {Holds(f,s0),\nHolds(f,s1)} and I2 =\n{Holds(f,s0),\n\u00acHolds(f,s1)}.\n\nM1 is the intended model, in which nothing\nchanges. It satisfies Condition (3), since if\n<I1, S> satisfies T it\nsatisfies\n[\u2009c\u2009]Holds(f,s\n1) by the inertial axiom\n\n[[[\u2009c\u2009]Holds(f,s)]\n \u2227 Holds(f,s1)] \u2192\n[\u2009c\u2009]Holds(f,s\n1).\n\n\nTherefore, S = {I1}.\n\nM2 is an anomalous model, in which the fluent\nceases spontaneously. This model does not satisfy Condition (3), since\nM3 =\n<I2,{I1,\nI2}> also satisfies T; in particular,\nit satisfies the inertial axiom for f because it fails to satisfy\nHolds(f,s1). So, while M1 is a\npreferred model, M2 is not.\n\n\nTurner\u2019s approach avoids the problem of contraposition by giving\ncausal relations the form\n[BACKGROUND-CONDITIONS\n \u2227\n CAUSE] \u2192\n[\u2009c\u2009]EFFECT.\n\n\nWhen contraposed, this becomes \n[CAUSE\n \u2227\n\u00ac[\u2009c\u2009]\nEFFECT] \u2192 \u00acBACKGROUND-\nCONDITIONS,\n\n\nwhich does not have the form of a causal law. This solution is less\nthan fully satisfactory at solving the intuitive difficulties, because\nTurner\u2019s semantics seems intuitively to validate formulas such as\n\n[\u2009c\u2009][[\u00acDead\n \u2227 Ig] \u2192\nRun],\n\n\nand in this form, contraposition would be restored. The task of\nclarifying the foundations of causal theories of action and change may\nnot yet be complete.\n\n\nBut the apparent usefulness of a \u201cprinciple of universal causality\u201d\nin accounting for a range of problems in qualitative common sense\nreasoning will be tantalizing to philosophers. And the causal theory,\nas initiated by Geffner and developed by Turner, has many interesting\ndetailed features. For instance, while philosophical work on causality\nhas concentrated on the causal relation, this work in logical AI shows\nthat a great deal can be done by using only a nonrelational causal\npredicate.\n\n\nThe relation between causality and conditionals can be explored and\nexploited in various ways.  Lewis 1977\nundertakes to account for causality in terms of conditionals.  In the\nreverse direction, Lent and Thomason 2015\nuses Turner\u2019s causal approach to construct models for conditional logics,\nin the restricted case where the antecedent is the conjunction of an\naction expression and simple situational conditions.  The motivation for\nthis idea is than an explicit solution to the frame problem automatically\nprovides a semantics for such conditionals.\n\n\nMorgenstern\u2019s two chief criticisms of the causal approach to\nreasoning about actions are that it does not give an adequate account\nof explanation[34]\n and that the logical context in\nwhich it works (the Situation Calculus) is limited. As work on the\napproach continues, progress is being made in these areas. But the\nconstraints that a successful logic of action and change must meet are\nso complex that it seems to be a reasonable research methodology to\nconcentrate initially on a restricted logical setting.\n\n\nFor another approach to nonmonotonic causal reasoning, based on\ninput-output logics (Makinson\n& van der Torre 2000), see Bochman\n2004.\n4.7 Action Formalisms and Natural Language\n\n\nAlthough for many AI logicists, the goal of action formalisms is to\nilluminate an important aspect of common sense reasoning, most of their\nresearch is uninformed by an important source of insights into the\ncommon sense view of time\u2014namely, natural language. Linguists\nconcerned with the semantics of temporal constructions in natural\nlanguage, like the AI community, have begun with ideas from\nphilosophical logic but have discovered that these ideas need to be\nmodified in order to deal with the phenomena. A chief discovery of the\nAI logicists has been the importance of actions and their relation to\nchange. Similarly, an important discovery of the \u201cnatural language\nlogicists\u201d has been the importance of different kinds of events\n(including structured composite events) in interpreting natural\nlanguage. From work such as this the idea of \u201cnatural language\nmetaphysics\u201d (see, for instance,\n Bach 1989)\nhas emerged. \n\n\nThe goal of articulating a logical framework tailored to a\nrepresentational system that is motivated by systematic evidence about\nmeanings in natural languages is not acknowledged by all linguistic\nsemanticists. Nevertheless, it is a significant theme in the linguistic\nliterature. This goal is remarkably similar to those of the common\nsense logicists, but the research methodology is entirely\ndifferent.\n\n\nCan the insights of these separate traditions be reconciled and\nunified? Is it possible to constrain theories of temporal\nrepresentations and reasoning with the insights and research\nmethodologies of both traditions? In\n Steedman 1995\n (and\n 2000,\n listed in the Other\nInternet Resources Section), these important questions are addressed,\nand a theory is developed that extends action formalisms like the\nSituation Calculus, and that incorporates many of the insights from\nlinguistic semantics. The project reported in\n Steedman 2000\n is still incomplete, but the\nresults reported there make a convincing case that the event-based\nideas from linguistics can be fruitfully combined with the\naction-centered formalisms in the AI literature. The possibility of\nthis unification is one of the most exciting logical developments in\nthis area, bringing together as it does two independent descendants of\nthe earlier work in the logic of time.\n",
