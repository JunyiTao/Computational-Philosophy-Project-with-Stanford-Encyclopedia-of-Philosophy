In this entry, the available\nphilosophical literature on this topic will be critically reviewed.\nHowever, relatively few academic works on the topic of search engines\nhave been written from a philosophical perspective. And only a handful\nof the existing publications that focus specifically on the\nethical aspects of search engines have been contributed by\nphilosophers (see, for example, Nagenborg 2005).\n",
