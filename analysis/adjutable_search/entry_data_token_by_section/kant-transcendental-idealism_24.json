    "main_text": "Things in themselves, noumena, and the transcendental object || Phenomena and noumena\n6.1 Phenomena and noumena\n\nIn the section \u201cOn the ground of the distinction of all objects\ninto phenomena and noumena\u201d, which he\nsubstantially revised for the B Edition, Kant reiterates his argument\nthat we cannot cognize objects beyond the bounds of possible\nexperience, and introduces a complex distinction between phenomena and\nnoumena.\n\nFortunately, it is relatively clear what phenomena are:\n\u201cappearances to the extent that as objects they are thought in\naccordance with the unity of the categories are called\nphenomena\u201d (A249). Earlier, in the \u201cAesthetic\u201d, Kant\nhad defined appearance as: \u201cthe undetermined object of an\nempirical intuition\u201d (A20/B34). All objects of empirical\nintuition are appearances, but only those that are \u201cthought in\naccordance with the unity of the categories\u201d are phenomena. For\ninstance, if I have a visual after-image or highly disunified visual\nhallucination, that perception may not represent its object as\nstanding in cause-effect relations, or being an alteration in an\nabsolutely permanent substance. These would be appearances but not\nphenomena. The objects of \u201cuniversal experience\u201d, as\ndefined in section 3, are phenomena because the categories determine\nthe a priori conceptual form; universal experience represents\nits objects under the unity of the categories.\n\nKant\u2019s then introduces the concept of noumena:\n\n\nif, however, I suppose that there be things that are merely objects of\nthe understanding and that, nevertheless, can be given to an\nintuition, although not to sensible intuition (as coram intuiti\nintellectuali), then such things would be called noumena\n(intelligibilia). (A249)\n\n\nThe concept of a noumenon, as defined here, is the concept of an\nobject of cognition for an intellect that is not, like ours,\ndiscursive, and thus has a non-sensible form of intuition, which Kant\nhere designates \u201cintellectual\n intuition\u201d.[64]\n A sensible intuition is one that can only intuit objects by being\ncausally affected by them; a non-sensible intuition is one in which\nthe intuition of the object brings the object into existence. Thus,\nthe concept of a noumenon is the concept of an object that would be\ncognized by an intellect whose intuition brings its very objects into\nexistence. Clearly, we do not cognize any noumena, since to cognize an\nobject for us requires intuition and our intuition is sensible, not\nintellectual.\n\nKant then connects the concept of noumena to things in themselves:\n\n\n\nit also follows naturally from the concept of an appearance in general\nthat something must correspond to it which is not in itself\nappearance, for appearance can be nothing for itself and outside of\nour kind of representation; thus, if there is not to be a constant\ncircle, the word \"appearance\" must already indicate a relation to\nsomething the immediate representation of which is, to be sure,\nsensible, but which in itself, without this constitution of our\nsensibility (on which the form of our intuition is grounded), must be\nsomething, i.e., an object independent of sensibility. Now from this\narises the concept of a noumenon, which, however, is not at\nall positive and does not signify a determinate cognition of something\nin general, in which I abstract from all form of sensible intuition.\n(A251\u20132)\n\n\nThis passage begins with the familiar point that the very concept of\nappearance requires that there be something that is not appearance\nthat appears. Usually Kant makes this point using the concept\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d (e.g., in the Prolegomena\n(Ak. 4:314\u20135); cf. Bxxvi\u2013xxvii, B306, and B307). However,\nhere he claims that this idea\u2014that it cannot be\n\u201cappearances all the way down\u201d\u2014brings with it the\nidea of noumena. This is puzzling. Why must whatever it is that appear\nto us as phenomena be conceived of as an objects of intellectual\nintuition?\n\nKant clarifies precisely this point in the B Edition by distinguishing\nbetween a positive and a negative sense of \u201cnoumena\u201d: \n\n\nIf by a noumenon we understand a thing insofar as it is not an\nobject of our sensible intuition, because we abstract from\nthe manner of our intuition of then this is a noumenon in the\nnegative sense. But if we understand by that an\nobject of a non-sensible intuition then we assume a\nspecial kind of intuition, namely intellectual intuition, which,\nhowever, is not our own, and the possibility of which we cannot\nunderstand, and this would be the noumenon in a\npositive sense. (B307)\n\n\nNoumena in a positive sense are simply noumena as Kant originally\ndefined that notion in the A edition: objects of an intellectual\n(non-sensible) intuition. The negative concept of noumena, however, is\nsimply the concept of objects that are not spatiotemporal (not objects\nof our sensible intuition, namely space and time). But then it follows\nthat things in themselves are noumena in the negative sense,\nretrospectively clarifying the passage from the A edition quoted\nimmediately above, where Kant seems to draw from the\n\u201cTranscendental Aesthetic\u201d the conclusion that there are\nnoumena: the concept of appearance requires that something appears,\nand this must be a negative noumena.\n\nPutting these pieces together we can see that \u201cthings in\nthemselves\u201d [Dinge an sich selbst] and (negative)\n\u201cnoumena\u201d are concepts that belong to two different\ndistinctions: \u201cthing in itself\u201d is one half of the\nappearance/thing in itself distinction, which Kant originally defined\nat A491/B519 in terms of their existence: appearances have no\nexistence \u201cgrounded in themselves\u201d while things in\nthemselves do. \u201cNoumena\u201d is one half of the distinction\nphenomena/noumena which Kant characterizes at B307 as the distinction\nbetween what can be an object of our sensible spatiotemporal intuition\nand what cannot be an object of sensible intuition. (Kant here appears\nto overlook the possibility of objects of sensible but\nnon-spatiotemporal intuition). One is a distinction in what ground the\nexistence of objects; the other is a distinction in what kinds of\nintuition can present those objects. However, we can make a connection\nbetween them: things in themselves, the objects whose existence is\n\u201cground in itself\u201d, and which appear to us in space and\ntime, cannot be objects of any sensible intuition, so they are\nnegative noumena. Whether, additionally, they are also objects of an\nintuitive intellect, is a separate matter. This is a point about the\nrelations among these concepts; it holds whether or not they are\npossibly instantiated.\n",
