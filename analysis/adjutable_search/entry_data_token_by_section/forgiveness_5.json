    "main_text": "Cognate Phenomena || Reconciliation\n2.5 Reconciliation\n\nWhen we are wronged, this typically damages our relationship with the\nwrongdoer. Minor offenses might put strains on relationships that put\nburdens on both persons involved; serious offenses might lead the\nvictim to terminate the relationship altogether. Further, when we\nblame others for their wrongs against us, we often do so at the cost\nof causing further relational damage. We might withhold expressions of\ngood-will, or alter our behavior in ways that make clear that we no\nlonger trust the other.\n\nAlthough in many cases forgiveness will be accompanied by\nreconciliation, it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for\nforgiveness. One reason for thinking that reconciliation is not\nnecessary for forgiveness is that the offending party may be, for\nwhatever reasons, unwilling to reconcile. But the fact that I am\nunwilling to restore our relationship does not, all by itself, make it\nimpossible for you forgive me for the wrong I did to you. In other\ncases, reconciliation is practically impossible. Perhaps I have\nsecretly moved to Fiji and you have no way to get in touch with me.\nYou can forgive me whether or not you know I am in Fiji. In still\nother cases, restoring a relationship would be \u201cmorally\nunwise\u201d, as Jean Hampton puts it (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n42\u20133, fn. 9). Doing so might expose one to additional\npsychological damage, for example. Neither does reconciliation appear\nto be sufficient for forgiveness. Relationships may be restored, at\nleast to some degree, for purely pragmatic reasons.\n",
