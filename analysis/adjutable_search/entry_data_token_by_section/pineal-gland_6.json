    "main_text": "Descartes\u2019 Views on the Pineal Gland || The Treatise of Man\n2.1 The Treatise of Man\nIn the Treatise of man, Descartes did not describe man, but a kind of conceptual models of man, namely creatures, created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul. \u201cThese men will be composed, as we are, of a soul and a body. First I must describe the body on its own; then the soul, again on its own; and finally I must show how these two natures would have to be joined and united in order to constitute men who resemble us\u201d (AT XI:119, CSM I:99). Unfortunately, Descartes did not fulfill all of these promises: he discussed only the body and said almost nothing about the soul and its interaction with the body.\nThe bodies of Descartes\u2019 hypothetical men are nothing but machines: \u201cI suppose the body to be nothing but a statue or machine made of earth, which God forms with the explicit intention of making it as much as possible like us\u201d (AT XI:120, CSM I:99). The working of these bodies can be explained in purely mechanical terms. Descartes tried to show that such a mechanical account can include much more than one might expect because it can provide an explanation of \u201cthe digestion of food, the beating of the heart and arteries, the nourishment and growth of the limbs, respiration, waking and sleeping, the reception by the external sense organs of light, sounds, smells, tastes, heat and other such qualities, the imprinting of the ideas of these qualities in the organ of the \u2018common\u2019 sense and the imagination, the retention or stamping of these ideas in the memory, the internal movements of the appetites and passions, and finally the external movements of all the limbs\u201d (AT XI:201, CSM I:108). In scholastic philosophy, these activities were explained by referring to the soul, but Descartes proudly pointed out that he did not have to invoke this notion: \u201cit is not necessary to conceive of this machine as having any vegetative or sensitive soul or other principle of movement and life, apart from its blood and its spirits, which are agitated by the heat of the fire burning continuously in its heart\u2014a fire which has the same nature as all the fires that occur in inanimate bodies\u201d (AT XI:201, CSM I:108).\nThe pineal gland played an important role in Descartes\u2019 account because it was involved in sensation, imagination, memory and the causation of bodily movements. Unfortunately, however, some of Descartes\u2019 basic anatomical and physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by our standards, but also in light of what was already known in his time. It is important to keep this in mind, for otherwise his account cannot be understood. First, Descartes thought that the pineal gland is suspended in the middle of the ventricles.\n\nFigure 6. The Pineal Gland According to Descartes. This image from the 1664 edition of the Treatise of man illustrates Descartes\u2019 view that the pineal gland (H) is suspended in the middle of the ventricles (Descartes 1664, p. 63).\n\nBut it is not, as Galen had already pointed out (see above). Secondly, Descartes thought that the pineal gland is full of animal spirits, brought to it by many small arteries which surround it. But as Galen had already pointed out, the gland is surrounded by veins rather than arteries. Third, Descartes described these animal spirits as \u201ca very fine wind, or rather a very lively and pure flame\u201d (AT XI:129, CSM I:100) and as \u201ca certain very fine air or wind\u201d (AT XI:331, CSM I:330). He thought that they inflate the ventricles just like the sails of a ship are inflated by the wind. But as we have mentioned, a century earlier Massa had already discovered that the ventricles are filled with liquid rather than an air-like substance.\nIn Descartes\u2019 description of the role of the pineal gland, the pattern in which the animal spirits flow from the pineal gland was the crucial notion. He explained perception as follows. The nerves are hollow tubes filled with animal spirits. They also contain certain small fibers or threads which stretch from one end to the other. These fibers connect the sense organs with certain small valves in the walls of the ventricles of the brain. When the sensory organs are stimulated, parts of them are set in motion. These parts then begin to pull on the small fibers in the nerves, with the result that the valves with which these fibers are connected are pulled open, some of the animal spirits in the pressurized ventricles of the brain escape, and (because nature abhors a vacuum) a low-pressure image of the sensory stimulus appears on the surface of the pineal gland. It is this image which then \u201ccauses sensory perception\u201d of whiteness, tickling, pain, and so on. \u201cIt is not [the figures] imprinted on the external sense organs, or on the internal surface of the brain, which should be taken to be ideas\u2014but only those which are traced in the spirits on the surface of the gland H (where the seat of the imagination and the \u2018common\u2019 sense is located). That is to say, it is only the latter figures which should be taken to be the forms or images which the rational soul united to this machine will consider directly when it imagines some object or perceives it by the senses\u201d (AT XI:176, CSM I:106). It is to be noted that the reference to the rational soul is a bit premature at this stage of Descartes\u2019 story because he had announced that he would, to begin with, discuss only the functions of bodies without a soul.\nImagination arises in the same way as perception, except that it is not caused by external objects. Continuing the just-quoted passage, Descartes wrote: \u201cAnd note that I say \u2018imagines or perceives by the senses\u2019. For I wish to apply the term \u2018idea\u2019 generally to all the impressions which the spirits can receive as they leave gland H. These are to be attributed to the \u2018common\u2019 sense when they depend on the presence of objects; but they may also proceed from many other causes (as I shall explain later), and they should then be attributed to the imagination\u201d (AT XI:177, CSM I:106). Descartes\u2019 materialistic interpretation of the term \u2018idea\u2019 in this context is striking. But this is not the only sense in which he used this term: when he was talking about real men instead of mechanical models of their bodies, he also referred to \u2018ideas of the pure mind\u2019 which do not involve the \u2018corporeal imagination\u2019.\nDescartes\u2019 mechanical explanation of memory was as follows. The pores or gaps lying between the tiny fibers of the substance of the brain may become wider as a result of the flow of animal spirits through them. This changes the pattern in which the spirits will later flow through the brain and in this way figures may be \u201cpreserved in such a way that the ideas which were previously on the gland can be formed again long afterwards without requiring the presence of the objects to which they correspond. And this is what memory consists in\u201d (AT XI:177, CSM I:107).\nFinally, Descartes presented an account of the origin of bodily movements. He thought that there are two types of bodily movement. First, there are movements which are caused by movements of the pineal gland. The pineal gland may be moved in three ways: (1) by \u201cthe force of the soul,\u201d provided that there is a soul in the machine; (2) by the spirits randomly swirling about in the ventricles; and (3) as a result of stimulation of the sense organs. The role of the pineal gland is similar in all three cases: as a result of its movement, it may come close to some of the valves in the walls of the ventricles. The spirits which continuously flow from it may then push these valves open, with the result that some of the animal spirits in the pressurized ventricles can escape through these valves, flow to the muscles by means of the hollow, spirit-filled nerves, open or close certain valves in the muscles which control the tension in those muscles, and thus bring about contraction or relaxation of the muscles. As in perception, Descartes applied the term \u2018idea\u2019 again to the flow of animal spirits from the pineal gland: \u201cAnd note that if we have an idea about moving a member, that idea\u2014consisting of nothing but the way in which spirits flow from the gland\u2014is the cause of the movement itself\u201d (AT XI:181; Hall 1972, p. 92). Apart from the just-mentioned type of bodily motions, caused by motions of the pineal gland, there is also a second kind, namely reflexes. The pineal gland plays no role with respect to them. Reflexes are caused by direct exchanges of animal spirits between channels within the hemispheres of the brain. (Descartes did not know that there are \u201cspinal reflexes\u201d.) They do not necessarily give rise to ideas (in the sense of currents in the ventricles) and are not brought about by motions of the pineal gland.\n",
