    "main_text": "Disability and Health || The Second Approach: Health as More or Other than the Absence of Disease\n2.2 The Second Approach: Health as More or Other than the Absence of Disease\n\nAn alternative approach to the relationship between health and\ndisability involves a broad or positive conception of health as more\nthan, or distinct from, the absence of disease or disability.\nThis approach has more and less instrumental versions. The former is\nrepresented by Nordenfelt\u2019s account of health as the ability of\nan individual to reach her \u201cvital goals\u201d\u2014those whose\nachievement is independently necessary and jointly sufficient for\nminimal happiness (Nordenfeldt 1995). On such an instrumental account,\nthe relationship of disability to health depends on the goals that are\nconsidered vital or central and on the role of typical functions in\nachieving them. Some impairments will hinder the pursuit of some goals\n(goal-based accounts of health vary in whether or how they specify the\nrelevant environment(s) affecting their pursuit), other impairments\nwill have no effect, and some will enhance the pursuit of\nsome goals. Any generalizations about the impact of impairments on\nhealth will depend on the assessment of their net effect on the\npursuit of the specified goals.\n\nThe breadth of an instrumental approach is apparent in Sridhar\nVenkatapuram\u2019s variation on Nordenfeldt, which replaces the\nlatter\u2019s mix of universal and personal \u201cvital goals\u201d\nwith the \u201cbasic capabilities for minimal happiness\u201d, as\nenumerated by Martha Nussbaum. \u201cWhat is important\u201d,\nVenkatapuram maintains, is \u201cthe idea of health as the capability\nto achieve a cluster of basic capabilities and functionings\u201d\n(277). Far from denying\nthat this conception resembles the much-ridiculed 1948 WHO definition\nof health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social\nwell-being\u201d, Venkatapuram just alters that definition to refer\nto a capability for minimal well-being. Nor does he\nshirk from the practical implications of this conception: \n\n\n\u201cHealth policy and expertise will have to encompass all the\ndeterminants of the core human capabilities that constitute a\nminimally decent life\u201d (278). \n\n\nAt the same time, he recognizes a narrower conception of health,\ntreating it as one of the more specific capabilities that health in\nhis broader conception encompasses. Health in this narrow sense is\njust the capacity to avoid disease and impairment. But it is unclear\nwhy even health in this narrow sense should be a constituent of\nwell-being, given the fact of human mortality and vulnerability. \n\nLawrence Becker has proposed a broad but less instrumental conception\nof health, examining positive conceptions of health in other\ndisciplines, specifically models of positive mental health in\npsychology, which incorporate notions such as resilience, robustness,\ndevelopmental maturity, character strength, and subjective well-being\n(Becker 2005). Such conceptions go beyond the absence of disease in\ntwo ways: they are positive, requiring psychophysical\nvitality\u2014robustness, vigor, and resilience\u2014and they are\nbroad, concerned not merely with biomedical functioning but with more\ncomprehensive well-being.\n\nMore recently, Becker (2012) argues for \u201cbasic good\nhealth\u201d as the metric for \u201cbasic justice\u201d. For\nBecker, basic good health is defined in interactive terms, as\n\u201creliably competent physical and psychological functioning in a\ngiven environment\u201d (2012: 45). As David Crocker (2013) observes,\nthis notion \n\n\nhas both negative and positive elements. The negative dimension\nincludes absence of disease, illness, disability, and other\nimpairments. The positive aspect is \u2026 \u201drobustly active\nagency. To be healthy is to have a kind of agency appropriate to the\nstages on life\u2019s way\u2014from infancy to mature adulthood to\nold age. \n\n\nThis positive aspect of basic good health, if not the notion as a\nwhole, gives support and structure to the claim that one can be\ndisabled but healthy. It could also promote the development of health\ninterventions for people with disabilities that are not directed at\nthe normalization of their atypical or impaired functions. One\nchallenge for this approach is to limit the scope of positive health,\nso that it does not encompass all aspects of well-being, but remains\nanchored in biomedical functioning. A second challenge for this\napproach is to explain how cognitive and affective conditions bear on\nhealth, and how any adverse effects of such conditions can be\nmitigated or eliminated without medical normalization.\n",
