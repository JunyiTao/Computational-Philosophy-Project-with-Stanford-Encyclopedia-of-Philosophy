    "main_text": "\n\nThomas Paine was a pamphleteer, controversialist and international\nrevolutionary. His Common Sense (1776) was a central text\nbehind the call for American independence from Britain; his Rights\nof Man (1791\u20132) was the most widely read pamphlet in the\nmovement for reform in Britain in the 1790s and for the opening\ndecades of the nineteenth century; he was active in the French\nRevolution and was a member of the French National Convention between\n1792 and 1795; he is seen by many as a key figure in the emergence of\nclaims for the state\u2019s responsibilities for welfare and\neducational provision, and his Age of Reason provided a\npopular deist text that remained influential throughout the\n19th century. In his own lifetime, and subsequently, he has\nbeen extensively vilified and often dismissed. Yet many of his ideas\nstill command wide interest and enthusiasm in readers throughout the\nworld.\n",
