    "main_text": "Ontological Innocence? || The set-theoretic argument\n5.1 The set-theoretic argument\n\nThe first argument begins by asking us to consider the claim\n\n(17)\n There are some sets which are all and only the non-self-membered\nsets.\n\n\nand admit that it is true. It continues by arguing that, if plural\nexpressions were committed to collections or any other\n\u201cset-like\u201d objects, then the truth of (17) would lead\nstraight to Russell\u2019s paradox. This is sometimes thought to be a\nknock-down argument in favor of Ontological Innocence (Boolos 1984:\n440\u2013443 [1998a: 64\u201367]; Lewis 1991: 65\u201369; McKay\n2006: 31\u201332). But in fact it is less conclusive than it appears.\nFor as we saw in\n Section 4.3,\n Russell\u2019s paradox will follow only if two alternative views are\nruled out. Since these views cannot be dismissed out of hand, much\nwork remains before this argument can be said to be conclusive.\n",
