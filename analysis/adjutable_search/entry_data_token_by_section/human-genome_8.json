ELSI\nfunding is mandated through the National Institutes of Health\nRevitalization Act of 1993, which calls for a minimum of 5 percent of\nthe NIH budget for the HGP\u2014the monies directed to the\nNCHGR-NHGRI\u2014to be set aside to study the ethical, legal, and\nsocial implications of the science of genomics (McEwen et al. 2014).\nThe Division of Genomics and Society at the NIH\u2019s NHGRI, created\nin 2012, maintains the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI)\nResearch Program as an extramural grant funding initiative to the\npresent day; the division also includes an intramural bioethics\nprogram. Input concerning the ELSI program is provided by the NHGRI\nGenomics and Society Working Group through the National Advisory\nCouncil for Human Genome Research.\n\nA review article by NIH staff (McEwen et al. 2014) characterizes the\nELSI program as \u201can ongoing experiment.\u201d Since it was\nestablished in 1990, the ELSI program has supported empirical and\nconceptual research carried out by researchers from a broad range of\ndisciplines: \u201cgenetics and genomics, clinical medicine,\nbioethics, the social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology,\nanthropology, political science, and communication science), history,\nphilosophy, literature, law, economics, health services, and public\npolicy\u201d (p. 485). This research is considered to have had\nimpacts on genomics studies (e.g., requirements for informed consent,\nprotection of the privacy of subjects, and nomenclature for socially\ndefined groups), genomic medicine (e.g., personal impacts of acquiring\ngenetic information from screening and testing carried out in\nclinical, research, and direct-to-consumer settings), and wider\nsociety (e.g., federal legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination\nin health insurance and employment, increased awareness about DNA\nforensics, and policies on gene patenting). The experimental aspect\nremarked upon refers to the organizational and physical situation of\nELSI, a program charged with critically evaluating the implications\ngenomics research, within the very agency that funds that research.\nWhile this institutional arrangement supports the growing trend to\nintegrate ELSI research with genomics research and policy formulation,\nensuring that ELSI research is scientifically informed and practically\nrelevant, excessive proximity also risks compromising \u201cthe\nautonomy, objectivity, and intellectual independence of ELSI\ninvestigators\u201d (McEwen et al. 2014).\n\nSince the early years of the HGP, bioethicists have criticized ELSI on\nvarious institutional grounds: for a lack of independence from\nscientist-overseers (Murray 1992; Yesley 2008), for an absence of\nstructure conducive to providing guidance regarding policy (Hanna\n1995), and for a negative impact on bioethics in narrowing the range\nof topics covered and creating an isolated subspecialty within the\nfield (Annas and Elias 1992; Hanna et al. 1993). And from history and\nphilosophy of science quarters, broader philosophical concerns have\nbeen raised about ELSI\u2019s focus on the ethical, legal, and social\nimplications of genetic research. Such a focus promotes a\n\u201cdownstream\u201d rather than \u201cupstream\u201d framework\nfor understanding the relationship between science and ethics that\nfails to appreciate that foundational concepts in genetic research\nsuch as normality and mutation are themselves evaluative and operate\nas directives to action (Limoges 1994). ELSI\u2019s European\ncounterpart, Ethical, Legal and Social Aspects or ELSA, chose to use\nthe term \u201caspects\u201d in order to avoid the connotations of\nnarrowness, linearity, and determinism attached to the term\n\u201cimplications\u201d (Hilgartner et al. 2016).\n\nThe \u201congoing experiment\u201d at the NIH\u2019s NHGRI has come\nto define a particular model for doing research in bioethics that is\nbeing exported to other rapidly developing scientific fields, as\nexpressed in the title of a target article published in AJOB\nNeuroscience, \u201cTo ELSI or Not to ELSI Neuroscience: Lessons\nfor Neuroethics from the Human Genome Project\u201d (Klein 2010).\nIndeed, although \u201cELSI\u201d entered the lexicon as an acronym\nfor the specific extramural research program supported by US\ngovernment funding set aside for the HGP (elsewhere in the world,\nsimilar programs received their own appellations and\nacronyms\u2014e.g., Genomics and its Ethical, Environmental,\nEconomic, Legal, and Social Aspects or GE3LS in Canada),\nwith that program offering a possible model for other emerging\nsciences, the term has come to receive a broader meaning that refers\ninstead to a field of research, defined by its \u201cresearch and\nscholarship content, rather than a particular set of funding\nsources\u201d (Morrissey and Walker 2012, p. 52). Given the interest\nin exporting the ELSI model, its merits as a field of research, as\nbioethicists Clair Morrissey and Rebecca L. Walker argue (Morrissey\nand Walker 2012; Walker and Morrissey 2014), need to be examined.\nInvestigating the content and methods of ELSI as a field of research,\nMorrissey and Walker combed through hundreds of articles and book\nchapters published between 2003 and 2008 (Morrissey and Walker 2012,\nWalker and Morrissey 2014). They found that funding sources influenced\nwhat research is carried out: though only 17 percent of all\npublications involved empirical research, for publications whose\nauthors received US government funding, 30 percent of those with\nnon-NHGRI support and 52 percent of those with NHGRI support were\nempirically based. They found that institutional and professional\nforces, irrespective of funding sources, promoted the coverage of\ntopics of greatest interest to affluent populations (e.g.,\n\u201cgenomics and clinical practice,\u201d \u201cintellectual\nproperty,\u201d \u201cgenetic enhancement,\u201d and\n\u201cbiorepositories\u201d). They found that the vast majority (89\npercent) of publications were prescriptive, recommending to diverse\nactors (scientists, clinicians, bioethicists, government, etc.) that\ncertain policies or practices be pursued. Given this overwhelmingly\nprescriptive posture, they were dismayed to find that publications\nmade use of multiple bioethical methods in piecemeal fashion with\nlittle depth. For the most part (77 percent), publications did not\nreflect on methods.\n\nELSI itself has become an object of research in science and technology\nstudies (STS) scholarship. The ELSI model, as incorporated more\nrecently in areas such as nano and synthetic biology, is understood as\nserving as \u201ca new governance tool built on the prior\ninstitutionalization of \u2018bioethics\u2019 as a way to manage\nproblems of moral ambiguity and disagreement in biomedicine\u201d\n(Hilgartner et al. 2016, p. 824). At the outset of the HGP, ELSI\nrelied on a governance model in which ethicists and social scientists\nlent their expertise by producing a body of scholarship that could\ninform public policy; subsequently, especially in Europe, social\nscientists were expected to facilitate mechanisms for making public\npolicy in more democratic ways by engaging stakeholders and the\nbroader public. Hilgartner et al. (2016) argue that STS scholarship\nsits somewhat uneasily alongside ELSI scholarship inasmuch as STS\nscholarship problematizes elements of the \u201ctraditional\nimaginaries of orderly science-society relations\u201d to which ELSI\nsubscribes, such as the fact/value distinction, the\n\u201cneutrality\u201d of science and technology, and \u201cthe\nself-evidence of power relations\u201d (p. 832). Criticisms are also\nmade that as a tool of governance, bioethics exercises power in ways\noften unseen, thereby foreclosing questions asked and debates\nhad\u2014for e.g., taking the boundary between facts and values as\ngiven not made, presenting rational moral arguments as outside\npolitics to dismiss issues of public concern, or circumventing\nlegislation by justifying the extension of existing regulations.\n",
