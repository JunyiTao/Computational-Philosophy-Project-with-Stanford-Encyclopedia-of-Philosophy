    "main_text": "The Arguments for Occasionalism || The \u201cNo Necessary Connection\u201d (NNC) Argument\n3.3 The \u201cNo Necessary Connection\u201d (NNC) Argument\n\nAs noted earlier, the criticism of positing necessary \n connections[20]\n between creaturely powers and their effects first emerges in the work\nof al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b. In the \u201cSeventeenth Discussion\u201d\nof The Incoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nwrites:\n\nThe connection between what is habitually believed to be a cause and\nwhat is habitually believed to be an effect is not necessary,\naccording to us. But [with] any two things, where \u201cthis\u201d\nis not \u201cthat\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d is not\n\u201cthis,\u201d and where neither the affirmation of the one\nentails the affirmation of the other nor the negation of the one\nentails the negation of the other, it is not a necessity of the\nexistence of the one that the other should exist, and it is not a\nnecessity of the nonexistence of the one that the other should not\nexist\u2014for example, the quenching of thirst and drinking, satiety\nand eating, burning and contact with fire, light and the appearance of\nthe sun, death and decapitation, healing and the drinking of medicine,\nthe purging of the bowels and the using of a purgative, and so on to\n[include] all [that is] observable among connected things in medicine,\nastronomy, arts, and crafts. Their connection is due to the prior\ndecree of God, who creates them side by side, not to its being\nnecessary in itself, incapable of separation. On the contrary, it is\nwithin [divine] power to create satiety without eating, to create\ndeath without decapitation, to continue life after decapitation, and\nso on to all connected things. The philosophers denied the possibility\nof [this] and claimed it to be impossible. (TF 170)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s target is the \u201cAristotelian\nphilosopher\u201d, exemplified by Avicenna, who affirms strict causal\nnecessitation relations between creaturely causes and their effects. A\ncentral motivation behind this criticism is to secure the possibility\nof miracles reported in the Qur\u2019\u00e2n and the prophetic\ntraditions that were considered impossible by these philosophers\noriented towards \u201cAristotelianism\u201d (TF 166; cf.\nMarmura 2005, 146).\n\nAccording to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, the proper understanding of divine\nomnipotence dictates that no limitation on divine power is justified,\nunless the state of affairs impermeable to divine power is one that is\nlogically inconsistent. In other words, it is within divine power to\nbring about any state of affairs except for those that are logically\ninconsistent\u2014for instance, where I both exist and not exist:\n\nThe impossible is not within the power [of being enacted]. The\nimpossible consists in affirming a thing conjointly with denying it,\naffirming the more specific while denying the more general, or\naffirming two things while negating one [of them]. What does not\nreduce to this is not impossible, and what is not impossible is within\n[divine] power. (TF 179)\n\n\nGiven the examples in TF 170, we see that\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does not take the state of affairs in which, say,\na live fire does not burn a dry piece of cotton to be impossible. For,\naccording to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, there is no logical entailment\nrelation between the cotton coming into contact with the fire and its\nburning. Hence, it is logically consistent to suppose that cotton not\nburn when it comes into contact with fire.\n\nThe interesting question is how the Aristotelian philosopher would\nrespond to this claim. Why couldn\u2019t Avicenna simply deny that\nthis state of affairs is possible in that the suggestion of fire not\nburning cotton indeed is logically inconsistent, given their\nrespective natures or essences? In other words, why couldn\u2019t the\nAristotelian philosopher contest the non-entailment claim and argue\nthat the essences of fire and cotton along with the event of their\ncoming into contact do entail the event of the cotton burning?\n\nAs we can see in the long quote from TF 170 and other\npassages in The Incoherence (e.g. TF 1), the\noperative conception of entailment for al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b appears to\nthat of \u201cconceptual\u201d entailment, where the concepts of\n\u201cfire\u201d and \u201ccotton\u201d are rather sparse in terms\nof content. Whatever content is contained in these concepts, they are\nstill sparse enough to not entail such facts as \u201cthe burning of\nappropriately dry cotton that comes into contact with fire.\u201d In\nother words, the causal powers typically identified as being part of\nthe essences of created substances, something the Aristotelian\nphilosophers would have found very hard to resist, are not built into\nthe concepts, as it were, for al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b.\n\nIn this case, the main issue of contention between\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and the fal\u00e2sifa would concern how\nrich the contents of the concepts of creatures are. What\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b needs is a rather thin notion of what a concept\nor essence of a creature is, while the Aristotelian philosopher would\nobviously argue for a richer understanding of the contents of these\nconcepts, one that would include various causal powers as their\nessences. A key intuition driving al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s view\nseems to be that if one takes the concepts of creatures to be rich in\nthis way, then there is no logical space for the miraculous\nintervention on the part of God. For on the Aristotelian scheme,\ndivine intervention such as God\u2019s keeping the cotton from\nburning would imply that either God has to change the cotton into\nsomething else at the time of\n intervention,[21]\n or that God has to done something that is logically inconsistent, or\nimpossible.\n\nNeither option seems palatable to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, and his\ninnovative proposal is to distinguish between logical connections and\ncausal connections. On al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s scheme, the\nlogically necessary constitute a much narrower set of connections than\nthose that are causally necessary (Dutton 2001, 24\u20135; Schmaltz\n2008b, 299\u2013301). This setup allows him to claim that when God\nintervenes to stop a piece of dry cotton from burning, which obviously\ndiverges from the natural course of events, God need not change the\ncotton fibers into some material that is fire-resistant, nor is he\ndoing something that is logically impossible. Rather, God is bringing\nabout a state of affairs that is perfectly consistent, hence,\npossible, but one that is an exception, when compared to the normal\ntype of causal connections we come to expect between fire and\ncotton.\n\nBut what then grounds these normal types of causal connections we\ntypically anticipate? If they are not grounded in the natures or\nessences of things, what is their source? As we saw in the long quote\nfrom TF 170, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b not surprisingly holds that\n\u201c[t]heir connection is due to the prior decree of God, who\ncreates them side by side, not to its being necessary in itself,\nincapable of separation.\u201d In other words, the law-like relations\nthat we typically think to hold between creaturely natures are\nactually grounded in divine decrees.\n\nThe question of whether al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b himself is committed to\noccasionalism depends on whether al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b regards this\nclaim that the \u201cconnection [between creatures] is due to the\nprior decree of God\u201d to be incompatible with there being real\nsecondary causation\u2014that is, genuine creaturely causation. As\nnoted earlier, interpreters disagree on this issue. Some, such as\nMarmura, argue that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b did find the two claims to be\ninconsistent, and rejects the latter claim that there are real\nsecondary causes. Marmura grants that the texts in the\nIncoherence are insufficient to support this claim, but\nargues that other texts well establish al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s\ncommitment to occasionalism (Marmura 2005, 145\u201352). Other\ninterpreters, such as Griffel in addition to Perler and Rudolph, have\nargued that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b leaves open the possibility that\nGod\u2019s causal activity is consistent with some form of genuine\nsecondary causality, on the condition that the secondary causation in\nquestion is not of the type espoused by the fal\u00e2sifa\n(Griffel 2007; Perler & Rudolph 2000, 75\u201377).\n\nWe end our discussion of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b on necessary connections\nwith the following observation: if al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does consider\ngenuine secondary causation to be consistent with divine causal\nactivity, he would have to concede that there are distinct types of\ncausation. For al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b would have granted that the causal\nconnection between the decree of God and its effect is substantially\ndifferent from the causal connection between a creaturely cause and\nits effect. The former type of connection would be the strongest of\nall possible causal connections, since divine omnipotence would\nrequire that for all events that are logically possible, should God\ndecree their occurrence, they would come about with causal necessity.\nIn contrast, creaturely causes obviously lack this omnipotent power,\nsuch that whatever causal connection they have to their effects, it\ncannot be, in principle, as strong as that of divine decree. So this\nsuggests that the strength of the causal connection would differ\nsubstantially between divine causation and secondary causation, and\nthis difference might lead one to wonder these two types of causation\ncan be brought under a single, univocal notion of causation.\n\nIn the work of Nicolas Malebranche, to whom we now turn, we are\npresented with an explicit argument denying secondary causation on the\ngrounds that (1) something is a true cause if and only if there is a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect and (2) there are\nnecessary connections only between the will of God and its effects.\nConsider the following passage from the Search:\n\nA true cause as I understand it is one such that the mind perceives a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect. Now the mind perceives\na necessary connection only between the will of an infinitely perfect\nbeing and its effects. Therefore, it is only God who is the true cause\nand who truly has the power to move bodies. (OCM II\n316/Search 450)\n\n\nThough the argument clearly is couched in terms of perceiving\nnecessary connections, the overall context makes it clear the central\npoint is more metaphysical in nature. Malebranche\u2019s key point\nhere is that there are no causally necessary connections between\nalleged creaturely causes and their effects, since creaturely causes\ncannot but fall short of the criterion of genuine causation, that is,\nnecessary\n efficaciousness.[22]\n\nWhy is it that creaturely causes cannot but fall short in this way?\nAccording to Malebranche, this is due to the fact that God could\nalways will some event contrary to what the creature allegedly brings\nabout. For instance, Malebranche invites us to consider the case of\ndemons, where God wills to bring about a state of affairs contrary to\nwhat demons will:\n\n\u2026 [L]et us suppose that God wills to produce the opposite of\nwhat some minds will, as might be thought in the case of\ndemons \u2026 that deserve this punishment. One could not say in this\ncase that God would communicate His power to them, since they could do\nnothing they willed to do. (OCM II 316/Search 450)\n\n\nSimilar to what we had seen in al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nMalebranche\u2019s core intuition appears to be that it is plainly\npossible for a creature to fail to bring about some effect that is\ntypically thought to be within the purview of its causal powers. To\ndeny such a possibility would entail a problematic restriction on\ndivine omnipotence, or so Malebranche appears to be thinking. This is\nnot to say that Malebranche is willing to expand divine omnipotence\nlimitlessly, such that divine volition would have power over logical\ntruths, for instance. In contrast to Descartes, Malebranche was\nagainst the doctrine of the creation of eternal truths. Certain truths\nfor Malebranche hold of logical necessity: those truths whose denials\nare contradictory are independent of and insulated from divine\nvolitional intervention. In this respect, he is in agreement with\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b. For both philosophers, divine power extends to\nall and only that which is possible, that is, logically\nconsistent.\n\nOnce again, the interesting question is how one should think of the\nnatures of things, and whether the natures of things are rich enough\nto have various conceptual entailments that are logically binding. An\nAristotelian realist about secondary causes would likely hold that the\nnatures of creatures are robustly rich such that the effects that even\nan omnipotent God can bring about are restricted to the possibilities\nallowed by these creaturely natures. Malebranche is denying this view\nof creaturely natures, in that the options for God, as it were, are\nmuch more diverse, and we wonder on what grounds Malebranche can argue\nfor this view. In the case of extended substances or bodies, a reason\nthat is independent of theological motivations might be available to\nMalebranche in the following way: armed with a Cartesian understanding\nof extended substances, Malebranche could say that given the sparse\nessence of bodies, consisting of merely size, shape, and motion, there\nare no conceptual entailments that follow from a concept of a given\nbody that are rich enough to support the typical causal connections\nAristotelians would like to affirm. That is, proper consideration of\nwhat bodily substances are, Malebranche could argue, clearly reveal\nthat there are no such entailments. And, perhaps, an analogous case\ncan be made for thinking substances, to the effect that that a\nthinking substance essentially has thoughts does not lead to any\nobvious conceptual connections that would dovetail nicely with the\ncausal powers traditionally identified as belonging to the mind. That\nis, the mere having of certain thoughts, which is the essence of the\nmind, carries no implications as to what other thoughts one must have\nsubsequently or what other states of mind one must be in.\n\nNot surprisingly, Malebranche also has some theologically motivated\nreasons for rejecting such rich conceptions of natures as well. He\nappears to find the idea that divine efficient causality is bound by\nnatures of creatures to be rather problematic: \u201cwhen one thinks\nabout the idea of God, i.e., of an infinitely perfect and consequently\nall-powerful being, one knows that there is such a connection between\nHis will and the motion of all bodies, that it is impossible to\nconceive that He wills a body to be moved and that this body not be\nmoved\u201d (OCM II 313/Search 448). In other\nwords, were there a conceptually necessary connection between body A\nmoving body B in a particular way, then even if God were to will body\nB to move in a different manner, given the assumed conceptually\nnecessary connection that holds between body A and body B, God\u2019s\nvolition would fail. But this is impossible, Malebranche is arguing,\ngiven the proper understanding of divine omnipotence. So, for\nMalebranche, the proper understanding of divine omnipotence dictates\nthe absence of conceptual entailments that determine specific\nmovements. \n\nInterestingly enough, from this claim concerning the necessary\nefficaciousness of divine volition, Malebranche immediately infers\n\u201c[w]e must therefore say that only His will can move bodies if\nwe wish to state things as we conceive them and not as we sense\nthem\u201d (OCM II 313/Search 448). This is a\nproblematic move, as we have already seen in our discussion of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b. For to accept that divine power is unique in its\nnecessary efficaciousness need not itself imply that God is the only\ncause. Many a theist would grant that creaturely causes lack necessary\nefficaciousness on the very grounds that Malebranche had presented,\nbut still argue that this does not mean that they lack causal powers.\nDivine concurrentists, for instance, typically argue that all\nsecondary causation requires divine concurrence, such that the\ncreature\u2019s powers in themselves are never sufficient to bring\nabout an effect, and that God\u2019s power is such that he could\nalways override the causal contribution of the creature and bring\nabout a contrary effect. Despite such concessions, divine\nconcurrentists nonetheless affirm the causal activity of the creature\nin producing the effect when the effect is concurrently produced. What\nMalebranche needs to establish, then, is the claim that causation just\nis necessary efficaciousness, and the pressing question for\nMalebranche is how he can defend this claim.\n\nIn the Search at least, Malebranche seems to be thinking that\nthe divine intervention cases provide us with a reason to think that\nit is God who does all the causal work. For when God intervenes to\nbring about an effect contrary to what the demon wills, it is clear\nthat God is the unique cause of the event. So parity of reasoning\nsuggests, or so Malebranche seems to be thinking, that in the normal\ncase in which I will my arm to go up and it does go up, it is also God\nwho alone brings about my arm going up. But this argument is far from\nconvincing, since it does not follow from the fact that my power can\nbe overridden in certain circumstances, that I am powerless\nsimpliciter. We still need to consider cases when my power is\nnot overridden, and it seems clear that the fact that I successfully\npushed the door shut when my five year old son pulled to open it does\nnot entail that when my son is successful in opening the door with my\nhelp, my son is causally ineffective.\n\nIn fairness to Malebranche, we might point out that, in identifying\nnecessary connections with genuine causality, Malebranche is\npresenting an attractive reductive analysis of causation, one that we,\nbenefitting from the exposure to David Hume\u2019s work, are already\nfamiliar with. In fact, it does not seem far-fetched to say that it is\nin part due to Hume that we are accustomed to such a clear-cut\nunderstanding of causation as necessary connection. But note that the\nintellectual climate of Malebranche\u2019s time period was rather\ndifferent: philosophers were trying to come to grips with the\ncomplicated task of understanding the nature of causality given the\nnew scientific developments of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies. Moreover, this endeavor took place against the backdrop of\nthe traditional approaches to causation, involving the confusing\nmyriad of the four Aristotelian causes. Compared to the Aristotelian\nconception, Malebranche\u2019s conception of causation is remarkably\nsimple and unified, and does not face the question of how such diverse\nand distinct types of Aristotelian causes can come under a single\nconception of causation. Furthermore, there is some evidence that\nMalebranche might have responded to our challenge to produce a better\nargument for this conception of causation as necessary connections by\nnoting how difficult it is to imagine what causation would be if not\nnecessary connections, in much the same way that Hume did. That is,\ngiven his statement in the Search that \u201c[a] true cause\nas I understand it [c\u2019est ainsi que je\nl\u2019etends] is one such that the mind perceives a necessary\nconnection between it and its effect\u201d (Search 450, my\nemphasis), Malebranche might have had something close to the Humean\nidea in mind\u2014though not developed as clearly and\nemphatically as in Hume\u2014that we have no conception of\nwhat a causal connection would be, if it is not a necessary\nconnection. If so, this intuition could have provided a rationale for\nthe claim that an event is a true cause if and only if there is a\nnecessary connection between it and its effect. But given how\ncontroversial such a claim is within the context of considering divine\ncausation in nature, one wonders whether this central claim\nidentifying necessary connection with causation could have been\nfurther\n motivated.[23]\n",
