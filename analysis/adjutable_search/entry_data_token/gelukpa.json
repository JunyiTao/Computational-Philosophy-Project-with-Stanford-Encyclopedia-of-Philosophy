Ultimate Truth and the Middle Way\n\nThe Geluk interpretation of the Middle Way offers a unique\npresentation of the Buddhist doctrine of two truths: the ultimate\ntruth and conventional (or relative) truth. Geluk philosophers are\nconcerned to avoid the reification of the ultimate truth and the\ndeprecation of conventional truth, arguing that conventional existence\nand ultimate nonexistence are mutually implicative. In this tradition,\nthe two truths are said to be \u201cextensionally identical but\nintensionally distinct\u201d (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha\ndad). That is, the two truths are not different entities, but are\nconceptually distinct aspects of all entities. Thus Geluk philosophers\nargue that (1) to exist is to be empty and (2) to exist is to exist\nconventionally (see Changkya in Cozort 1998, 429).\n\nThe ultimate truth is said to be emptiness because things are not\nfound to exist separate from their parts, causes, or designations;\nthis non-finding itself is the meaning of emptiness. Emptiness, too,\nis not \u201cfound\u201d when sought (emptiness is empty, too). To\nbe found (when an ultimate essence is sought) is to be intrinsically\nor ultimately real, and nothing has this status for the Geluk\ntradition, not even emptiness. Emptiness is interpreted in the Geluk\ntradition as a non-implicative negation (med dgag). As\nopposed to a negation that implies something else, a non-implicative\nnegation is simply an absence, such as a lack of true existence. This\nmere lack or absence, as a negation of essence that does not implicate\nany other essence, is the meaning of the ultimate truth in the Geluk\ntradition. Nevertheless, the claim that there is nothing ultimately\nreal\u2014or that the ultimate truth is emptiness\u2014is itself a\n(conventional) truth (Jinpa 2002, 46\u201348). It is expressed like\nthis: \u201cThe ultimate truth is posited as solely the negation of\ntruth [that is, inherent existence] upon a subject that is a basis of\nnegation\u2026\u201d (Tsongkhapa, 396). Thus, on this view, nothing\nexists ultimately. This lack of essence in phenomena, or\n\u201cemptiness,\u201d does not annul their appearance or\nconventional reality. Rather, emptiness is held to be the condition\nfor the possibility for any appearance. To be empty means to arise\ndependently\u2014to lack independent, real existence. Since nothing\ncan be found to be independent, everything is said to be empty. Thus,\nin the Geluk tradition, emptiness is the nature of all phenomena (or\ntheir lack of independent nature), and all phenomena are\nnecessarily empty.\n2. Conventional Truth and the Consequence School\n\nGeluk philosophers take the radically anti-foundationalist,\nantirealist Consequence School (Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka),\ngrounded in the texts of the Indian Buddhist philosophers\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Candrak\u012brti, to be the most sophisticated\nschool of Buddhist philosophy. The Consequence School gets its name\nfrom the fact that it relies on reductio argument to\ndemonstrate emptiness, in contrast to independent formal arguments.\nAccording to Tsongkhapa, no independent formal argument can prove the\nemptiness of phenomena to those not already convinced of that fact\nbecause these arguments presuppose a common understanding of the terms\nused. That is, this kind of formal argument presumes that a subject\nmatter is objective or given and is understood in the same way by all\nparties to the debate, and he follows Candrak\u012brti in arguing that\nthis cannot be the case when an antirealist (who understands\nemptiness) and a realist (who lacks an understanding of emptiness)\nengage in dialogue (Changkya in Cozort 1998, 451). This is because a\nproponent of the Consequence School consents to no such given,\nobjective facts.\n\nBy invoking consensus as the mark of (conventional) reality, the Geluk\nschool\u2019s coherence theory of truth anticipates some of the\ninsights of the later Wittgenstein (see Thurman 1980). There are no\nfoundations in the Geluk tradition, neither ultimate nor conventional;\nthere is only transactional usage\u2014\u201cwhat is renowned in the\nworld.\u201d Thus, unlike some other Middle Way philosophies, like\nthe Autonomy School (sv\u0101tantrika), the distinction\nbetween \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d relative\ntruth itself depends upon our epistemic conventions and practices, not\non a world of independent truthmakers. \u201cWhat works\u201d is the\ncriterion; that is, what conforms to the ways of the world is a\nconventional truth in the way that a game works when you subscribe to\nits rules. Any further notion of a \u201ccorrect\u201d relative\nimplicates a foundation, an essentialist presumption about the way\nthings are (Changkya 1998, 321; B\u00f6tr\u00fcl 2011, 141).\nTherefore, the measure of what is correct is simply what conforms to\nthe world rather than based on any other warrant that would serve as a\ndeeper structure or more fundamental layer of reality beyond what is\nsimply conventional (Cozort 1998, 52).\n\nTsongkhapa identifies three criteria for conventional truth. A\nconventional truth is what (1) is acknowledged by a conventional\nepistemic instrument, (2) is not undermined by another conventional\nepistemic instrument, and (3) is not undermined by an analysis of its\nultimate nature (Tsongkhapa 2000, 627). The third criterion\nunderscores an important point in Gelukpa philosophy: that an\nobject\u2019s emptiness of intrinsic existence (its ultimate status)\ndoes not undermine its status as a conventional truth. Whether or not\nthis is successful, or if this is even possible, is a strongly debated\nphilosophical question. The first two criteria reflect the commitment\nthat what counts as true or real depends upon our epistemic resources,\nwhich themselves are mutually supportive, and which both support and\nare supported by the entities they reveal, as well as the fact that\nthere is a difference between being correct and incorrect regarding\nconventional truth. Because of this commitment to a robust sense of\nconventional truth, their rivals in Tibet have charged the Geluk\ninterpretation of the Middle Way with being realist (about the\nconventional truth) and nihilist (about the ultimate truth), or even\nan incoherent mixture\u2014full of contradictions\u2014of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s foundationalist epistemology with\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s antirealist ontology. The Geluk philosophy\ncontinues to be engaged in the debate about the unique role that\nepistemology plays within the antifoundationalist Consequence School\n(The Yakherds, 2021).\n\nTsongkhapa and his Geluk followers insist is that nothing exists on\nits own even conventionally; that interdependence is universal\n(Tsongkhapa 1988, 585). Therefore, we cannot ground conventions in any\ndeeper foundation. The fact that there is nothing but groundless\nconventions\u2014all the way up and all the way down\u2014is another\nway of seeing why the ultimate and the conventional are not distinct\nfrom one another; the two truths are none other than two aspects of\nthe same thing.\n\nGeluk philosophers argue that this explains the crucial distinction\nbetween the Middle Way (Madhyamaka) and the Mind-Only (Cittam\u0101tra\nor Yog\u0101c\u0101ra) schools of Buddhist philosophy which, on their\nreading, assigns the mind a privileged ontological status as the truly\nexistent ground of an illusory external world. Rather than claim that\nthe mind is independently real in contrast to unreal external objects,\nlike a subjective idealist, Geluk theorists argue that a proponent of\nthe Middle Way explicitly affirms the interdependency of minds and\nobjects. K\u00fcnzang S\u00f6nam (1823\u20131905), explains\nTsongkhapa\u2019s position as the thesis that minds and external\nobjects are equally conventionally existent and equally ultimately\nnonexistent, and so of exactly the same ontological and\nepistemological status. He goes on to show how external objects are\naccepted conventionally in the Consequence School because the\ncoextensive presence and absence of objects and cognitions undermines\nthe claim that even conventionally there are no external objects. That\nis, when there are external objects, there are internal cognitions,\nand when there are internal cognitions, there are external objects;\ncognitions and objects are paired and thus rise and fall together. He\nreiterates this point by saying that not only does no conventional\nanalysis negate external objects, but that conventional analysis\nundermines the absence of externality (K\u00fcnzang 2007, 706\u2013707).\nOne might think that since Geluk philosophers take the existence of\nthe external world to be affirmed in the Consequence School, that they\nare committed to external realism, and indeed some of their critics\nhave accused them of this (The Yakherds 2021). But the affirmation of\nthe existence of the external world is simply an affirmation of its\nconventional reality, and of its knowability using conventional\nepistemic instruments. So, while Geluk philosophers are not idealists,\nthey are certainly not external realists, either.\n\nTsongkhapa outlined three types of \u201cintrinsic\ncharacteristic\u201d (rang mtshan) that convey important\nfeatures of the different metaphysical systems of the Abhidharma,\nDharmak\u012brtian epistemology, and the Consequence School,\nrespectively. Through this threefold distinction he sets up his\npresentation of what uniquely defines the ultimate truth, and by\nimplication, the conventional truth, in the Consequence School, while\nincorporating a range of metaphysical systems into his comprehensive\ninterpretative scheme. Firstly, Tsongkhapa says that an\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d is distinguished from a\n\u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d in the Abhidharma context of\nmetaphysics, where an intrinsic characteristic distinguishes a\nparticular trope from a general type. That is to say, an intrinsic\ncharacteristic marks a contrast that delineates, for instance, the\nheat of fire (intrinsic characteristic) from its being a member of the\nlarger class of material form (general characteristic). Tsongkhapa\nconveys another meaning of \u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d\nfound in Dharmak\u012brtian epistemology that distinguishes the\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d that is the unique particular\nfrom that which is an universal. In contrast to the second meaning of\n\u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d\u2014which marks a contrast of\na more real kind of entity (a particular) from another, less\nsubstantially real counterpart (an universal)\u2014the third meaning\nof \u201cintrinsic characteristic\u201d represents a subtle kind of\nreification that is a problem. This third type of intrinsic\ncharacteristic is presupposed by distorted cognitions that impute\nthings to have independent existence. This kind of intrinsic\ncharacteristic, as the imputation of things existing on their own,\neven conventionally, is what Tsongkhapa describes as the subtle\nreification that is uniquely eliminated in the philosophical system of\nthe Consequence School (Tsongkhapa 2008, 425\u2013426).\n\nGeluk philosophers emphasize the interdependence \u2014 the\nrelational nature of things (the internal and external, and the\nultimate and conventional). Indeed, the argument for universal\nemptiness from the premise of interdependence is often called\n\u201cthe king of arguments.\u201d K\u00fcnzang S\u00f6nam says that\nit is \u201cthe king\u201d because it can simultaneously induce\ncertainty in emptiness and appearance from the side of emptiness;\nthere are no other Middle Way arguments that do this. That is,\ndemonstrating that the objects we encounter are (mere) appearance\neliminates the reification of (intrinsic) existence, while showing\nthat emptiness is the emptiness of intrinsic existence\u2014as\nopposed to empirical existence\u2014eliminates the misconception that\nthings are utterly nonexistent. The fact that the interdependent world\nexists (dependently, without intrinsic existence) reveals how the\nconventional and ultimate truths are paired in this philosophy. There\nis no hierarchy of a transcendent, ultimate world contrasted with the\nimmanent world of conventions that lacks any value. Rather, the\nontological unity of the two truths in the Consequence School erases\nthis dichotomy, and arguably erases the dichotomy of the domains of\nontology and ethics, too. That is, the system of this antirealist\n\u201cground\u201d of emptiness and interdependence arguably\nsupports an ethical system in a more seamless way than an instrumental\nnotion of ethics can, with its associated notion of a means or\n\u201cpath\u201d that results in a qualitatively different,\ntranscendent goal. Indeed, the Geluk (lit. \u201cway of\nvirtue\u201d) appeals to this ethical feature in its name.\n3. Unique Assertions of the Consequence School\n\nTsongkhapa contends that the superiority of the Consequence School to\nall other Buddhist philosophical schools is reflected in a series of\ntheses unique to this school, each of which reflects a deeper\nunderstanding of the nature of reality and cognition. We now turn to\nseveral of these. The Consequence School squarely rejects idealism:\nneither objects nor minds have a privileged status in this tradition,\nand so there is no privileged level of consciousness, and no\nself-validating awareness. While the Mind-Only school asserts that all\nthought and all appearances are grounded in a \u201cfoundational\nconsciousness\u201d (kun gzhi rnam shes) and that each\nmoment of consciousness is reflexively aware (rang rig), the\nConsequence School rejects these claims. The foundational\nconsciousness, he argues\u2014posited as a ground for sensory\nconsciousness\u2014represents a mistaken attempt by other Buddhists\nto understand personal identity, one that ends up reifying the self.\nTsongkhapa dispenses with this notion of a substrate consciousness and\nsees it as simply another reification.\n\nThe Mind-Only school is committed to the reality of a special kind of\nreflexive awareness (rang rig), by means of which the mind\nknows itself, a way that is different from the way a mind knows any\nother object. Geluk scholars deny that there is any such distinctive\nmode of reflexive awareness; the mind is simply a dependently arisen\nphenomenon, just like any other, and is known in just the way that\nother phenomena are known. Moreover, nothing appears the way it really\nis to an ordinary being (Jamyang Zhepa in Hopkins 2003, 930). For this\nreason, this philosophy does not partake in ordinary phenomenology.\nInstead, it is primarily concerned with critical ontology, or what we\ncould call a form of \u201contological deflationism,\u201d in that\nit aims to undermine the foundations of the entire ontological project\n(MacKenzie 2008, 197). Philosophers in the Geluk tradition also point\nout that the posit of reflexive awareness attributes to the mind a\nspecial status as an independently existent, self-knowing entity. Yet\na unique, first-personal access to self-awareness, being simply given\nin experience, presumes immediate access to truth. Tsongkhapa and his\nfollowers take this as a further reason to reject this view, since\naccording to those in the Geluk tradition, conventional truths are\ninterdependent, and knowledge is always mediated and contingent.\nMoreover, they argue, reflexive awareness offers no explanatory power\nin the realms of either the conventional or ultimate truth. Indeed,\nTsongkhapa argues that in the Consequence School, neither this kind of\nfoundational consciousness nor reflexive awareness are taken to exist\neven conventionally\u2014they are simply philosophical errors.\n\nTsongkhapa argues that another distinctive feature of the Consequence\nschool is its recognition of the existence of \u201cdisintegration as\nan entity\u201d (zhig pa\u2019i dngos po) to account for\ncausality (Hopkins 2003, 934\u201335). The impetus for the theory\nthat disintegration is a distinct entity is to provide an account for\ncausality in the absence of substance. Tsongkhapa argues that an\nentity\u2019s disintegration\u2014which many other Buddhist\nphilosophical systems take to be a non-entity\u2014is just as real as\nany positive entity, and so itself is as causally efficacious as any\nother entity or event. While attributing causal power to\ndisintegration is an attempt to preserve a non-substantialist theory\nof causality, this theory invites other problems, such as the\nreification of absence (i.e., treating emptiness as a\n\u201cthing\u201d), which has been a frequent target for critics of\nthe Geluk tradition.\n\nThe Geluk tradition also sees the Consequence School as offering an\nunapologetic affirmation of conventional reality, including the\nreality of the person. The Geluk tradition holds that transformation\nand liberation do not require us to deny the reality of the world, but\nrather to cease the superimposition of essences onto the entities we\nencounter and onto ourselves as subjects. This is another way of\nsaying that emptiness\u2014the absence of essence\u2014is a negation\nnot of existence per se, but rather of intrinsic\nexistence, or essence. That is, this analysis in terms of\nemptiness in a significant way leaves conventional phenomena intact,\nand merely refutes the claim that they exist ultimately.\nSignificantly, the denial of self, too, does not mean the denial of\nthe \u201cmere I\u201d (bdag tsam), or the conventionally\nexistent person (Jinpa 2002, 71). The mere I or the conventional\nperson is also accepted as conventional existent in the Geluk\ntradition. Only its reification or true existence is denied.\n4. Buddhist Context of Geluk Philosophy\n\nIt is important to recognize how Geluk philosophy is embedded within a\ndistinctively Buddhist soteriology. That is, the truth of no-self is\nliberating because understanding this is held to free one from the\nmistaken idea of a self that binds one to suffering. Knowledge of\nemptiness is key to this emancipatory process, as Tsongkhapa claims,\nfor one must realize emptiness as it is articulated in the Consequence\nSchool, the lack of true essence, to be free from the subtle sense of\nself and achieve nirv\u0101\u1e47a (Cozort 1998, 316). This view is\nalso maintained to be a prerequisite for the esoteric practices of\ntantra. Tantra is an important part of the path to liberation in the\nGeluk tradition. It is a path to liberation that is held to involve\ndistinct, esoteric methods, but without diverging from the\nphilosophical view of emptiness, which is indispensable. For this\nreason, Geluk philosophy is located squarely within the immanent world\nand the exoteric domain of discourse: the intersubjective spaces of\ndialogue and debate.\n\nTherefore, rather than overcoming mistaken concepts by circumventing\nthem in a mystical flash of insight or an ecstatic experience of\nunion, the Geluk tradition offers a more sober way to overcome\nmisconceptions, one based on clear, rational analysis and a direct\nappeal to this world. That is, this tradition holds reasoned analysis\nto be necessary to understand the nature of phenomena (or rather,\ntheir lack of nature). This is because an ascertainment of\nthe lack of true existence is held to be necessary to counteract the\ndirectly opposed notion\u2014the apprehension of true\nexistence\u2014which is the misinterpretation of reality (as more\nthan simply conventionally existing) that binds one to suffering. To\ndo this, it is not sufficient to simply \u201clet be,\u201d stare\ninto space, or ignore the cause of misinterpretation in some tranquil\n\u201cnonconceptual\u201d meditation; rather, one must have insight\ninduced by reason that counteracts the habit of holding onto true\nexistence.\n\nThus, in Geluk philosophy, we can say that insight into reality is not\nheld to be beyond thought, or attributed to some third category beyond\nthe world that is neither existent nor nonexistent, but is simply\ninsight into a world that is neither (ultimately) existent nor\n(conventionally) nonexistent. Even though Geluk scholars consent to\nthe fact that emptiness can be perceived nonconceptually\u2014in the\nrarified case of a highly developed meditation\u2014they maintain\nthat the emptiness that is known nonconceptually is no different from\nthe emptiness that is conceptually known. The sharp distinction\nbetween conceptual and perceptual arguably falls away when there is\nnothing beyond conceptual designation. It is not a surprise then that\nit is the conceptual ascertainment of emptiness that is a\nprincipal element of the Geluk school\u2019s philosophy. Moreover,\ntheir emphasis on the practice of insight is not based on an appeal to\na direct, unmediated access to what is beyond concepts, but to reason.\nReason is also given priority over scriptural authority, which is\nsubjected to the scrutiny of analysis and is adjudicated by reason\n(Tsongkhapa in Hopkins 1999, 71).\n5. Geluk Education\n\nFollowing Tsongkhapa\u2019s lead, the Geluk tradition came to\nestablish large monastic institutions that set the standard for\nscholastic education in Tibet. The curriculum at Geluk monastic\ninstitutions involves five primary topics: metaphysics\n(abhidharma), epistemology (pram\u0101\u1e47a),\nnegative dialectics (madhyamaka), path structure\n(Abhisamay\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra), and ethics\n(vinaya). Buddhist metaphysics instills the contours of a\nBuddhist view, including causality, impermanence, and an\nevent-metaphysics that ties these two together. The path structure\nalso plays a central role in traditional Buddhist philosophy: it\nprovides the philosophy with a telos, a narrative arch toward\nliberation and complete enlightenment. Ethics, too, is integral to\nthis path and to Buddhist philosophy in general, yet some of the most\ndistinctive and interesting features of Geluk philosophy are found in\nits epistemology, and in particular, negative dialectics.\n\nGeluk monks who train in philosophy study epistemology early in their\ncareers, and debate is a primary means by which this tradition is\ninternalized and enacted. Buddhist epistemology, as codified in\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Commentary on Epistemology\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika), lays out a systematic\npresentation of the means of knowledge and the rules for valid\ninference. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s epistemology can be said to be\nantirealist or conceptualist, in that he denies that language directly\nrelates to the contents of perception, which are ineffable\nparticulars. Yet to account for the relationship between real\nparticulars and unreal universals, the Geluk tradition develops what\nhas been dubbed a \u201csemi-realist\u201d position, whereby it\nasserts that there are universals that are real entities in contrast\nto the antirealism that denies that universals are entities (Dreyfus\n1997, 173). Here again we see a collapse of duality; this time, the\nconcept-percept duality that underwrites Dharmak\u012brtian\nepistemology.\n\nStraddling the delicate line between a realist view that affirms the\nreality of universals and an antirealist one that denies the reality\nof concepts, a Geluk account of epistemology holds that universals are\nreal, but that they do not exists separately from their particular\ninstances. For instance, the universal \u201ccow\u201d and the\nparticular instances of cow are held to be not utterly distinct, as\nantirealists would have it, nor are they held to be the same, as a\nstrict realist would claim, but are rather said to be\n\u201cextensionally identical but intensionally distinct\u201d\n(Dreyfus 1997, 174\u201378). In the epistemological context,\narticulating this relationship is an attempt to account for the\nefficacy of concepts without giving universals an autonomous existence\napart from their instances. Given that the Geluk tradition claims that\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s epistemological project represents an\ninferior philosophical position, it is arguably studied for didactic\npurposes, whereas the nominalism of what Geluk thinkers consider their\nown tradition\u2014the view of the Consequence School of the Middle\nWay\u2014is the hallmark of their philosophy.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["B\u00f6tr\u00fcl (<em>bod sprul mdo sngags bstan pa\u2019i nyi\nma</em>, 1898\u20131959), 2011. <em>Distinguishing the Views and\nPhilosophies: Illuminating Emptiness in a Twentieth-Century Tibetan\nBuddhist Classic</em>, translated, annotated, and introduced by\nDouglas Duckworth, Albany, NY: SUNY Press.", "Cabez\u00f3n, Jos\u00e9 Ignacio, 1994. <em>A Dose of\nEmptiness: An Annotated Translation of the sTong thun chen mo of mKhas\ngrub dGe legs dpal bzang</em>, Albany, NY: State University of New\nYork Press.", "Changkya Rolp\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9 (<em>lcang skya rol pa\u2019i\nrdo rje</em>, 1717\u20131786), 1998. <em>Presentation of\nPhilosophical Systems</em> (<em>grub pa\u2019i mtha\u2019 rnam par\nbzhag pa gsal bar bshad pa thub bstan lhun po\u2019i mdzes\nrgyan</em>), Qinghai, China: Nationalities Press.", "Cozort, Dan, 1998. <em>The Unique Tenets of the Middle Way\nConsequence School</em>, Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications.", "Dreyfus, Georges, 1997. <em>Recognizing Reality:\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Philosophy and its Tibetan\nInterpretations</em>, Albany, NY: State University of New York\nPress.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2003. <em>The Sound of Two Hands Clapping:\nThe Education of a Tibetan Buddhist Monk</em>, Berkeley, CA:\nUniversity of California Press.", "Garfield, Jay, 2006. \u201cThe Conventional Status of Reflexive\nAwareness: What\u2019s at Stake in a Tibetan Debate?\u201d\n<em>Philosophy East and West</em>, 56(2): 201\u2013228.", "Garfield, Jay L., and Geshe Ngawang Samten, 2006. <em>Ocean of\nReasoning</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Hopkins, Jeffrey, 1980. <em>Tantra in Tibet:</em> <em>The Great\nExposition of Secret Mantra</em>, London: Allen and Unwin.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1999. <em>Emptiness in the Mind-Only School\nof Buddhism</em>, Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002. <em>Reflections on Reality</em>:\n<em>The Three Natures and Non-Natures in the Mind-Only School: Dynamic\nResponses to Dzong-ka-ba\u2019s The Essence of Eloquence</em>,\nBerkeley, CA: University of California Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2003. <em>Maps of the Profound</em>,\nIthaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2008. <em>Tsong-kha-pa\u2019s Final\nExposition of Wisdom</em>, Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion Publications.", "Jinpa, Thupten, 2002. <em>Self, Reality, and Reason in Tibetan\nPhilosophy</em>, London: Routledge Curzon.", "K\u00fcnzang S\u00f6nam (<em>kun bzang bsod nams</em>,\n1823\u20131905), 2007. <em>Overview of the Wisdom Chapter</em>\n(<em>spyod \u2019jug shes rab le\u2019u\u2019i spyi don rim par\nphye ba zab mo rten \u2019byung gi de kho na nyid yang gsal sgron\nme</em>).
