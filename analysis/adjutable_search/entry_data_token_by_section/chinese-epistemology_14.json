    "main_text": "Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology || Ultimate Knowledge and the Exploration of Things vs. Secluded Meditation\n4.4 Ultimate Knowledge and the Exploration of Things vs. Secluded Meditation\n\nThese new concepts led to a polarization of epistemology which also\nmanifested itself in the methods of comprehension. Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy presents two epistemological currents, which were named\n\u201crealistic\u201d and \u201cidealistic\u201d (or\n\u201cintuitionistic\u201d) by Western sinology. Both were based on\nthe different portions of The Book of Rituals (Li ji\n\u79ae\u8a18 ), which is part of the classic Confucian canon.\n\nThe epistemology of the \u201crealistic\u201d current followed the\nparadigms of the Great learning (Da xue\n\u5927\u5b78), which postulates the exploration of things\n(gewu) for the purpose of attaining ultimate knowledge\n(zhi zhi \u81f4\u77e5 ). These approaches were previously\nadvocated by Han Yu (768\u2013824), a precursor of Neo-Confucianism,\nand by most of the above mentioned Neo-Confucians such as Zhou Dunyi,\nCheng Yi and especially Zhu Xi (Zhu 1999: 14, 48). However, in Zhu\nXi\u2019s understanding the exploration of things (gewu) was\nnot limited to the process of investigation. In order to explore a\nthing one should exhaustively recognize all of its qualities (Zhu\n1999: 15, 3). For him, exploring things (gewu) and attaining\nultimate knowledge (zhizhi) form a unity (Zhu 1999: 15,\n17).\n\nThe \u201cidealistic\u201d or \u201cintuitive\u201d studies of\nknowledge of Neo-Confucian epistemology was derived primarily from the\nDoctrine of the Mean (Zhong yong \u4e2d\u5eb8)\nand sought to achieve recognition of reality based upon the practice\nof secluded meditation or concentration (shendu\n\u614e\u7368). The main Neo-Confucian exponents of this\nepistemological current were Li Ao and Cheng Hao. According to them,\nthe indeterminable cosmic force dao represented the only true\nbase of comprehension. The main goal of the introspection in the sense\nof secluded meditation was thus to understand dao (Cheng and\nCheng 1981: I, Yi Shu, 13, 221).\n",
