    "main_text": "Five Fountainheads of Japanese Philosophy || Western Academic Philosophy\n3.4 Western Academic Philosophy\n\nThe fourth major source of Japanese philosophy, the first of the two\nadditional ones to enter modern Japan, has been the aforementioned\ninflux of Western philosophy into the universities. As\ntetsugaku, Western philosophy became a standard discipline in\nthe newly established Japanese universities designed on Western\nmodels. The philosophy courses, like most other subjects of Western\norigin, were initially taught by Westerners, mainly professors from\nGermany and the United States who came to Japan to teach the\ndiscipline in their native languages. To prepare students to benefit\nfrom that instruction, the government established a comprehensive\nsystem of preparatory academies (\u201chigher schools\u201d)\nscattered throughout the land in which the highly qualified were\ntrained not only in the basic academic disciplines of arts and\nsciences (both Western and East Asian) but also in the Western\nlanguages required for university instruction. Then after completing\ntraining in philosophy at the Imperial University (Tokyo Imperial\nUniversity was the first, then several others were added in other\nmajor cities around Japan), the most promising students were sometimes\nsent abroad to the West for further study, after which time they could\nassume professorships back home. Thus, as in other academic fields,\nphilosophers in Japan were groomed in Western studies from their early\nteenage years until their mid- or late twenties. As a result, their\nphilosophical education was truly global in scope.\n\nWestern Academic Philosophy and Modernization\n\n\nAlthough Roman Catholic Christian thought was introduced by\nmissionaries in the fifteenth century, it had a short-lived influence\nof about a century before it was banned as part of the closure of\nJapan to almost all foreign contact. Hence, the first strong and\nlasting impact of Western philosophy came in the late nineteenth\ncentury. Although its impact has been broad and difficult to\nsummarize, a few key points are especially noteworthy.\n\nFirst, in the two or three centuries preceding the modern period,\nConfucianism and its secular academies dominated the philosophical\nscene. Since Confucian philosophy placed a premium on the mastery of\nclassic historical texts and given the etymology of the neologism\ntetsugaku, it is probably not surprising that the study of\nthe history of Western thought was one pillar of the Japanese\nphilosophy curriculum. Many young philosophers could read the original\ntexts in English, German, or French and sometimes also in Greek or\nLatin. For a wider audience, there was a major publication effort to\ntranslate major Western philosophical works into Japanese. With\nJapan\u2019s new openness to Western ideas, modernization, and the\ndemocracy promised in the Meiji Constitution of 1889, there was\ninitially an attraction to the liberal political ideas of Rousseau and\nJ. S. Mill, for example.\n\nSecond, the stress on urgent technological and scientific development\nas well as the chance to break free from the canonicity of\nConfucianism (and to a lesser extent Buddhism) led to an almost\nimmediate interest in Comte\u2019s positivism and Mill\u2019s\nutilitarianism. With the new emphasis on mathematics and science,\nthere was also an interest in the new (still\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d) field of experimental psychology\nrepresented by Wilhelm Wundt and William James.\n\nIn the long run, however, German philosophy, especially German\nidealism had the most lasting and deep influence. This was partly a\nfortuitous connection brought about by the close association formed in\nthe late nineteenth century between Tokyo Imperial University and\nGermany. Not only were some key early foreign professors at Tokyo from\nGermany, but also Germany became the favored location for sending\nJapanese philosophy students for foreign study. Another factor was the\nmodernization strategy of Japanese government and intellectual\nleadership. To modernize as quickly as possible, a Western country was\nidentified as the model to emulate for each academic field. For\nexample, for medicine and physics, Germany was the target; for\ngovernment bureaucracy, France; for agricultural science and public\neducation for school children, the United States. Once the decision\nwas made, urgency made it difficult to change direction. And Germany\nwas chosen for philosophy. In that context even more than Plato or\nDescartes, Kant was considered the key figure for the founding of\ntetsugaku. He had settled the challenge of Hume\u2019s\nskeptical stance toward science, saved us from scholastic theological\nmetaphysics by establishing critical philosophy and the antinomies, as\nwell as given direction\u2013\u2013either positive or\nnegative\u2014to the development of Fichte\u2019s philosophical\nanthropology, Hegel\u2019s dialectical thinking, Schopenhauer\u2019s\nand Nietzsche\u2019s Will, Kierkegaard\u2019s subjectivism, and the\nlater school of neo-Kantianism. At least that became the mainstream\nview among the majority of Japan\u2019s early twentieth-century\nphilosophers.\n",
