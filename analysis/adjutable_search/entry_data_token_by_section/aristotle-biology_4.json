    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s Biological Practice\n5. Aristotle\u2019s Biological Practice\n5.1 The History of Animals as a Report of the Results of a Hoti-Investigation\n\nAs we saw earlier, Aristotle introduces his systematic study of the\ndifferences and attributes of animals as a\nhoti-investigation, a factual investigation preliminary to\nthe search for causal demonstrations. By studying it, then, we ought\nto be able to develop a rich picture of what this theoretically\nmotivated, preliminary stage of investigation aims to achieve, and\nperhaps a glimpse of what such an investigation entails.\n\nAs many studies, following up on the pioneering work of David Balme\n(1961, 1987b) have now established, the History of Animals\n(HA) is a work that from first to last displays and builds\nupon multi-differentiae division of animal differences (see Gotthelf\n1988, 1997b; Lennox 2001b, chs. 1, 2; Pellegrin 1986). It is organized\nas a study of four kinds of animal differences first mentioned in\nHA\u2019s first chapter as the principal objects of study\n(at 486b22\u2013487a14)\u2014differences in parts (the topic of\nBooks I\u2013IV), in modes of activity and ways of life (those\nrelated to generation in Books V-VI--and human generation in\nIX--others in Book VII) and in characters (Book VIII). These in turn\nare sub-divided; for example, discussion of the non-uniform\nparts (organs, as we say) of animals with blood (I 7-III 1) is\nfollowed by that of their uniform parts (tissues, III\n2\u201322). A discussion of the parts of animals without blood then\nconcludes the discussion of differences in parts (IV 1\u20138). Book\nIV concludes with a discussion of differences in sensory faculties,\nvoice, and differences related to\n sex.[9]\n\nIt is only once Aristotle begins to distinguish differences\namong, say, uniform parts that various groupings of animals play an\nimportant role in organizing the discussion. And in so far as there\nare relatively stable general groupings of animals, these are\nidentified by noting their possession of stable correlations among\ndifferentiae\u2014for example, there are a large number of different\nanimals all of which have wings, feathers, beaks, and two fleshless\nlegs, and this group of animals has been given the designation\n \u2018bird\u2019.[10]\n In other cases, such groups have not been generally recognized, and\nAristotle simply refers to them by means of some of their most\nimportant correlated differences\u2014the four-legged and\nlive-bearing animals, for example, corresponding to our land mammals\n(with one important exception).\n\nWhat is clear from the practice of the History of Animals is\nboth the value of division and its limitations. Division by itself\ndoes not provide you with the axes of division; rather they\nare presupposed. Division does not give you animal kinds; as we saw in\nthe previous section, one needs to turn to PA I 4 and\nHA I 6 for Aristotle\u2019s thoughts on how those kinds are\nestablished. Something besides division is needed in order for a\nresearcher to recognize theoretically significant\nkinds, such as cephalopods or cetaceans. Why group animals together\nbased on their possession of four legs and the ability to give birth\nto living offspring (rather than eggs)? Certainly each of these traits\nis the product of a division, one of modes of locomotion and one of\nmodes of reproduction. But those divisions do not tell you that\nanimals with four legs that bear living young constitute a\nscientifically significant group.\n\nA second limitation of division is its indifference to the distinction\nbetween causally fundamental characteristics and proper attributes, to\nuse the language of the Analytics. Yet, being able to\ndistinguish these is absolutely fundamental to Aristotelian science. A\ncareful comparative study of the History of Animals, on the\none hand, and works such as On the Parts or On the\nGeneration of Animals, on the other, provides insight into how\nAristotle understands and deploys this distinction in his actual\nscientific practice. And as we have seen above, Aristotle draws\nexplicit attention to its importance for his biological investigations\nin a number of key texts within those investigations themselves. To\nstudy in detail the interplay between definition, causal demonstration\nand division in the biology is to see Aristotle working through just\nthose problems which form the central question of Posterior\nAnalytics II\u2014how precisely are definition, causal\ndemonstration and division related to one another in the quest for,\nand achievement of, scientific understanding?\n\nIt is impossible to present even a hint of the richness of the\nempirical content of the Historia Animalium here. Before\ngoing on to a discussion of the works that report the results of\nAristotle\u2019s causal investigations of animal parts and animal\ngeneration, however, two examples of reports from HA are\nprovided for comparison with corresponding discussions in PA\nand GA. The first example discusses the organs of respiration\nin blooded animals; these are the first internal organs\ndiscussed after Aristotle has concluded his review of their\nexternal parts. Here is how he introduces that\ndiscussion.\n\n\nSo, then, the number and character of the external parts of the\nblooded animals and how they differ from one another has been stated.\nWe must now discuss how the internal parts are situated, first in the\nblooded animals.\n\nAs many as (hosa) are four legged and live-bearing all\n(panta) have an esophagus and windpipe, arranged just as in\nhuman beings; it is also arranged similarly in as many of the four\nlegged animals as lay eggs, and in the birds; but they differ in the\nforms (tois eidesi) of these parts. Generally, all and only\n(panta hosa) those receiving air by inhaling and exhaling in\nevery case (panta) have a lung, windpipe and esophagus; and\nthe position of the esophagus and windpipe is alike in all,\nbut the organs are not, while the lung is neither alike in all nor is\nit positioned in a like manner. And again as many as (hosa)\nhave blood all (panta) have a heart\u2026 . But not all\n[blooded animals] have a lung, for instance fish do not, nor any other\nanimal there might be that has gills. (505b23\u2013506a12,\nexcerpts)\n\n\nThere are a number of features in this passage that are common\nthroughout the Historia Animalium and provide insight into\nits methods and aims. First is the syntactically redundant linguistic\npattern hosa\u2026panta (\u201cas many as...all\u201d),\nvariants of which are common in this treatise. Aristotle appears to\nuse the sentence form \u201cAs many as are X, all have Y\u201d for a\nquite specific reason. It is not just to note a universal\ncorrelation; it is to do so while leaving the extension of the\ncorrelation open\u2014a brilliant methodological innovation. New\nanimals with the correlation can be discovered, but the generalization\nwill not change, since it is about the universal correlation among\ndifferentiae\u2014in this case internal organs\u2014not about the\nkinds that exemplify it. It appears that when Aristotle intensifies\nthe expression by writing panta hosa, as he does once here,\nhe means to signal a convertible universal, an\n\u2018entailment\u2019 as we would say. Aristotle first lists a\nnumber of distinct groups, all the members of which have the three\norgans being discussed, windpipe, lung and esophagus. Then, using the\nterm \u2018generally\u2019 to signal what he is about to do, he\nidentifies a differentia that all these groups have in common, and\nwhich is coextensive with these three organs\u2014inhaling\nand exhaling air. The inductive pattern has the following form:\n\n\n\u2018As many as are P all have Y; As many as are\nQ all have Y\u2026 .\n\nGenerally, all and only those that are X (a feature common to\nP, Q\u2026) have Y\u2019.\n\n\nBy going on to note that as many as have blood have a heart, he\nimplicitly is warning the reader about a potential false inference one\nmight draw from the examples so far: that all blooded animals have a\nlung. He mentions fish as an example of blooded animals without a\nlung, but immediately identifies the relevant differentia:\n\u2018those blooded animals that have gills do not have\nthese organs [the lung and its associated parts]\u2019. He is careful\nnot to restrict the universal to a kind\u2014the relevant correlation\nis with gills, in whichever animals they might be found.\n\nWhile the inductive strategy of this work, directing us to high-level,\nconvertible universals is, I hope, now clear, it is also important to\nnote what is absent from this passage. Aristotle rarely in\nthis work claims any of these correlations is necessary, or\nthat others are impossible. He does not distinguish features\nthat are part of the essence of a kind from others that are\nmere attributes; and he typically avoids any hint of causal\nexplanation. All of this is to be expected, given the\nmethodological guidelines for historia that we discussed\nearlier\u2014historia is preliminary to causal investigation\nand prepares us for it. In the passage we are currently considering,\nfor example, it is striking that he notes the convertible correlation\nbetween lung, windpipe and esophagus, on the one hand, and inhaling\nand exhaling of air, on the other, but does not claim that\ntwo of the organs are present for the sake of breathing. (In fact, the\nword for \u2018breathing\u2019 is never used!) Though he uses the\nterm \u2018nature\u2019 regularly in HA, he does\nnot, as he does so often in his causal investigations, claim\nthat nature does nothing in vain, or that it always does what is best\nfor each organism. Nor does he talk about the parts of an animal as\nits material nature, nor about its living capacities as aspects of its\nformal nature. Indeed there is virtually no mention of the matter-form\ndistinction in HA. It is only when we turn to the various\nbiological treatises devoted to causal investigation that this\nlanguage associated with the search for definitions and demonstrations\ncomes to the fore.\n\nThe aim of this brief analysis of one small passage is to convey a\ntaste of the methodological depth and complexity of this great\nscientific treatise, so often misunderstood as a poorly organized\ncompendium of nature lore. I\u2019ll conclude this section with one\nmore example, from the books dealing with generation, so that we may\ncompare it with a corresponding discussion in De\nGeneratione Animalium.\n\nHA V-VI discuss all aspects of animal generation, moving from\nconsideration of differences in modes and timing of copulation and\nreproduction to the actual process of generation (or\n\u2018development\u2019, as we more often say). As in his discussion\nof parts, he moves through the various blooded kinds and then\ndiscusses generation in bloodless kinds and from identifying the\nuniversals common to all members of a group to identifying the\npeculiarities of more specific kinds. At HA VI 3, having\npreviously described the common and peculiar characteristics of\ncopulation in birds, he turns to recording his observations of the\ndevelopment of the chick at the critical fourth day after the egg has\nbeen laid.\n\nGeneration from the egg occurs in an identical manner in all birds,\nthough the time taken to termination varies, as we have said. In the\ncase of the hen, the first signs of the embryo are seen after three\ndays and nights; in larger birds it takes more time, in smaller birds\nless. During this time the yolk travels upwards to the point of the\negg\u2014that is where the starting point of the egg is and where it\nopens up, and the heart is no bigger than just a small blood-spot in\nthe white. This spot beats and moves as though it were alive; and from\nit, as it grows, two vein-like vessels with blood in them lead on a\ntwisted course to each of the two surrounding membranes. A membrane\nwith bloody fibers already surrounds the white of the egg, at this\ntime coming from the vessel-like channels. A bit later the body can\nalso be distinguished, at first very small and pale. The head is\napparent, and its eyes, very swollen; and this continues for a long\ntime, for it is later that they contract and become smaller.\n(561a4\u201321)\n\n\nHe begins with a wide generalization about all birds, followed by a\n\u2018more and less\u2019 correlation between the size of\nthe bird and the rate of development. This device allows\nAristotle to use the careful description of the chick egg opened on\nday four as a universal description of development; the reader is\nlicensed to infer that the same stage of development will occur in all\nbirds, but may occur either earlier or later, depending on whether\nthey are larger or smaller than the domestic chicken.\nAristotle\u2019s description of this classic experiment led to its\nbeing repeated many times in the\n Renaissance.[11]\n Anyone who has seen modern films of the chick at this stage of\ndifferentiation can appreciate the accuracy of Aristotle\u2019s\ndescription, especially when one takes into account the size of the\nchick embryo at this stage of growth.\n5.2 From Inquiry to Understanding; from hoti to dioti.\n\nFor Aristotle, \u2018historia\u2019, the scientific\norganization of information about animals\u2014serves the goal of\ncausal explanation; and, as I discussed in section 4., explanation by\nreference to goals and functions is the primary form of causal\nexplanation in biology.\n\nOn the Parts of Animals II-IV presents Aristotle\u2019s\nattempt to provide causal explanations for the sort of information one\nfinds organized in HA I-IV, information about the uniform and\nnon-uniform parts of animals. (PA I, it will be recalled, is\na discussion of the norms that are needed to guide the scientific\ninvestigation of animals; see section 4, above.) Here, I will be\nnarrowly focused on just a couple of passages in PA II-IV,\nbut will begin with a very brief sketch of its overall structure. It\nbegins (PA II 1\u20132) with a careful and complex\ndiscussion of the causal relationships between uniform and non-uniform\nparts (roughly, this distinction corresponds to our distinction\nbetween bodily fluids and tissues and organs), stressing the\nteleological priority of the whole organism to the parts, and among\nparts the priority of the non-uniform to the uniform. PA II\n3\u201310 then discusses the uniform parts, beginning with that out\nof which all the others are nourished, blood, and ending with flesh,\nbone, and analogous materials (nail, horn, hoof). From II 10 to III 3,\nAristotle discusses the external parts of blooded animals associated\nwith the head such as eyes, ears, nose and mouth. But when he gets to\nthe neck, he turns to the internal parts, and from III 3 to IV 4 he\ndiscusses the \u2018innards\u2019 of the blooded animals, parts such\nas heart, lung, liver, kidneys, and so on. From IV 5 to 9 he discusses\nthe parts, both internal and external, of the \u2018bloodless\u2019\nanimals, i.e. the crustaceans, testaceous mollusks, cephalopods and\ninsects. Finally, at IV 10, he returns to the external parts\nassociated with the torso and limbs of the live bearing and egg laying\nquadrupeds (10\u201311), birds (12), and fish (13); and ends by\ndiscussing a number of animals that \u2018dualize\u2019 between\nbeing land-dwellers and water dwellers or flyers.\n\nIn order to compare the methods of this treatise with the discussion\nof the parts in HA, it will be useful to look briefly at\nPA III 3, a discussion of the lung, windpipe and esophagus,\nthe part discussed in the passage from HA II quoted in section 5.1,\nabove. The first twenty lines of that discussion read as follows:\n\n\n\nNot all animals have a neck, but only those with the parts for the\nsake of which the neck is naturally present\u2014these\nare the windpipe and the part known as the esophagus. Now the larynx\nis present by nature for the sake of breathing; for it is\nthrough this part that animals draw in and expel air when they inhale\nand exhale. This is why those without a lung have no neck,\ne.g. the kind consisting of the fish. The esophagus is the part\nthrough which nourishment proceeds to the gut; so that animals without\nnecks manifestly do not have an esophagus. But it is not\nnecessary to have the esophagus for the sake of\nnutrition; for it concocts nothing. And further, it is\npossible for the gut to be placed right next to the position\nof the mouth, while for the lung this is impossible. For\nthere needs first to be something common like a conduit,\nwhich then divides in two and through which the air is separated into\npassages\u2014in this way the lung may best accomplish\ninhalation and exhalation.\n\nSo, then, the organ connected with breathing from necessity\nhas length; therefore it is necessary for there to be an\nesophagus between the mouth and the stomach. The esophagus is fleshy,\nwith a sinuous elasticity\u2014sinuous so that it\nmay dilate when food is ingested, yet fleshy so that\nit is soft and yielding and is not damaged when it is scraped by the\nfood going down. (664a14\u201334)\n\n\nI have highlighted the language of nature, necessity, possibility\n(and impossibility), and being for the sake of in this passage in\norder to highlight the contrast with the discussion of the same\norganic correlations in the corresponding HA passage. Here\nthe goal is explanation\u2014parts are present and have the\ncharacter they do primarily due to the conditional necessity imposed\nby the organism\u2019s functional requirements. One sees here the\nAristotle that so impressed the great French naturalist Georges\nCuvier: Aristotle is not only systematically discussing the adaptive\nfunctions of each of these organs; he is also displaying the complex\nway in which the internal parts of animals constitute an organic\nsystem.\n\nThe lack of names for animal kinds is also noteworthy; as in the\ncorresponding passage from HA II, fish are mentioned once as\nan instance of blooded animals that lack the organs in question; but\nthe stress throughout is on this particular system of organs in\nwhichever blooded animals have them. Aristotle\u2019s goal is to\nexplain why it is that certain animals have these organs, and why it\nis that, if they have one of these organs, they must\nhave the others. Some, but not all, of the explanations specify the\nfunction for the sake of which the parts are present; and even the\nmaterial nature of the tissues, whether fleshy or sinuous, may be\nexplained in functional terms. This discussion also displays a\nhierarchy of teleological connections of the sort described\nat the close of PA I 5, 645b28\u201333\u2014one activity is\npresent for the sake of another more basic one; a part that performs a\nsubordinate activity is present for the sake of a part that performs a\nmore important activity. Inhaling and exhaling are for the sake of\nrespiration (which is for the sake of cooling the blood); a windpipe\nis present for the sake of transporting air to and from the lung; a\nneck is present to protect the windpipe.\n\nFor reasons that will become clear, the relationship between the books\nof the Historia Animalium dealing with generation and On\nthe Generation of Animals (GA) is somewhat more complex.\nGA has a reasonably clear organization of its own; but its\ncentral (though not only) project of explaining the causal\nroles of the male and female in sexual generation and the causality of\nembryological development raises a host of topics and problems well\nbeyond the scope of HA. But a study of how the two works are\nrelated is nonetheless illuminating. This discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s biological practice will thus close by considering\nthe causal explanation of embryological development and in particular\nthe explanation for the early appearance of the heart, with a final\nlook at the application of this explanation to the case of embryonic\nbirds.\n\nAs I noted earlier, taken on its own terms, GA has a\nreasonably clear structure. Here again, as with PA II-IV, I will begin\nwith a brief sketch of its overall structure, before focusing narrowly\non its method as applied to one problem. It begins (715a1\u201318) by\nnoting that it will explain two sets of facts left unexplained in\nPA: the differences among the parts related to generation;\nand the generation of the parts generally. Though he\nacknowledges that some animals do not have males and females, he\ntreats sexual generation as his central topic. Initially he provides a\ntheoretically \u2018neutral\u2019 account of the distinction: the\nmale is what generates in another, the female what generates in itself\n(716a14\u201315). It is not until late in book I that he begins to\ndevelop his own detailed theory of their distinctive contributions to\ngeneration.\n\nThe first 13 chapters characterize the reproductive organs in the\nmales and females of blooded animals, while 14\u201316 do the same\nfor the bloodless animals that have males and females. Beginning in\nchapter 17, the discussion turns to the relevant uniform\nparts related to generation, sperma (roughly\n\u2018seed\u2019) and milk, but the discussion of milk is postponed\nuntil book IV. This immediately raises the contentious issue of\nwhether both male and female contribute sperma, and\nif both, then what the nature of their respective contributions is.\nThis is a large part of the discussion from I 17-II 5, one of the most\ndifficult stretches of text in the Aristotelian corpus, and the one on\nwhich our attention will be focused. But to continue our overview: the\nremainder of book II (from chapter 5 on) discusses the causes of the\nembryological development of live-bearing animals, while the\negg-laying animals are the primary focus in book III, which closes\nwith a discussion of animals that are not sexually generated,\nincluding those that arise \u2018spontaneously.\u2019 GA IV\nturns to the development of inherited differences within kinds,\nbeginning with the most important intra-specific difference for his\ntheory of generation, the difference between male and female. From\nthere it moves on to family resemblance, differences in the number of\noffspring produced and to the causes of deformities. GA V\naims to explain \u2018more and less\u2019 variations within kinds\nthat appear late in development and that may be fully accounted for by\nidentifying material level causal interactions\u2014differences\nwithin a kind in the color, texture or density of a part, for\nexample.\n\nThe remainder of this discussion will focus on the general causal\ntheory of animal generation developed in the first half of GA\n II.[12]\n In the closing chapters of book I, Aristotle argues that both the\nmale and female contributions are formed from a \u2018useful\nresidue\u2019 of blood by a concocting process, the male\u2019s\nbeing more fully concocted than the female\u2019s. From this point on\nthe male\u2019s contribution is typically termed gon\u00ea\n(semen), and the female\u2019s katamenia (menses). Aristotle\nis not entirely consistent, however: occasionally he uses the generic\nterm sperma for the male contribution and explicitly\ncontrasts it with katamenia (727a27\u201330); while at other\ntimes he refers to katamenia as a sort of sperma\n(728a26\u201329).\n\nThe two contributions are variously described. The male contributes a\nsource of movement or dunamis (\u2018power\u2019 or\n\u2018potential\u2019), which, as the argument unfolds, turns out to\nbe a special sort of capacity to heat present in the semen\u2019s\npneuma or air, which is part of its nature. (This gets fully\nworked out in GA II 2\u20133) The semen itself is mere a\nvehicle for delivering this heating capacity; the male makes no\nmaterial contribution to the offspring. The female contributes what\nmight be called \u2018prepared matter\u2019; all it needs is the\npresence within it of the heating capacity from the male and it begins\na more or less lengthy and complicated developmental process, which\nAristotle analogizes to a sort of automaton performing a complex set\nof coordinated movements once it is set in motion.\n\nHe relies at several points in the argument on an analogy with crafts,\nsuch as house building:\n\nIn animals that emit semen the nature in the male uses the semen as an\ninstrument possessing active movement, just as the tools are moved in\nthings that come to be by craft; for the movement of the craft is\nsomehow in these tools. (730b20\u201323)\n\n\nThis obscure analogy gradually gets unpacked in the first four\nchapters of GA II. The general principle common to art and\nnature is this:\n\nAs many things as come to be by nature or by art come to be by means\nof a being in actuality from that which is potentially such as that\nbeing. (734b22\u201323)\n\n\nIt is the prepared portion of the female\u2019s katamenia\nthat is potentially such as the contributor of semen is actually. And\nthe semen conveys to it a movement or power, such that \u201cwhen the\nmovement ceases each of the parts comes to be and is ensouled\n(734b24\u201325).\u201d That is, in embryological development, each\npart emerges within a system of parts that is organized to provide\nnutrition for its growth, and that is guided by a complex\n\u2018program\u2019 for its development. Notice that as each part\ncomes to be it already has the functional capacity associated with\nit\u2014it comes to be and is ensouled. Aristotle\ncharacterizes the process as follows:\n\n\nAs for hardness, softness, toughness and fragility and all the other\nsuch affections present in these ensouled parts, these affections\nmight be produced by heat and cold, but not the defining character\n(logos) in virtue of which the one part is flesh and the\nother bone; that is the result of the movement derived from the\ngenerator, being in actuality what that out of which it comes to be is\npotentially, just as in things that come to be by craftsmanship.\n(734b31\u201335)\n\n\nThis passage comes immediately after Aristotle has stressed two\nrelated points: that the uniform parts and the instrumental parts\narise simultaneously; and that even flesh and bone have a function to\nperform. These points are tightly connected. The defining features of\ntissues are not merely their affective qualities such as being hard or\nsoft, but their biological functions as well; and their biological\nfunctions are intimately connected to their roles in\nconstituting\u2014and being able to play functional roles\nin\u2014instrumental parts; many, if not all, of a part\u2019s\naffective qualities are a consequence of its biological role.\n\nIn the process of making this argument, Aristotle also stresses a\ncrucial and problematic dis-analogy: Natural things, once\ntheir generation begins, \u2018grow by means of themselves\u2019\n(735a13\u201314). This is the most fundamental difference between art\nand nature for Aristotle; a nature is a source of change within the\nthing itself (Physics II. 1). Natural development, then,\nthough initiated by the warmth contributed by the male parent,\ncontinues by means of a source of change within the developing embryo.\nThe carpenter may not mix any of his own material in his buildings;\nbut he must be continuously, physically involved in the movements that\ncreate those buildings. Not so with the male parent in natural\ngeneration. So how does a complex process that has its origins in an\nexternal generator become a natural process of development?\n\nFor Aristotle, the heart (or its analogue in bloodless animals) is\ncrucial. It is the first part created by the heat derived from the\nsemen of the male parent, and henceforth it is the primary internal\nsource of that heat and thus of further development (735a16\u201326).\nThe following explanation begins to bring us into contact with our\npassage on generation from the History of Animals.\n\n\u2026in the embryo (kuema), while in a way all the parts\nare present potentially, the source [of development] is most along the\npath to actuality. This is why the heart is first to be differentiated\nin actuality. And this is not only clear to perception (as it\nhappens), but is also clear to reason. When the developing thing is\ndistinct from both the male and female contributions, it must manage\nitself, as when a son sets up a home away from his father. So in\nanimals there must be a source of generation from which the later\norganizing of the body comes about. \u2026 Wherefore the heart\nappears differentiated first in all blooded animals; for it is the\nsource of both the uniform and the non-uniform parts. \u2026 And the\nprepared blood or its analogue is nutrient for the animal, and the\nblood vessels are its repository; for this reason the heart is their\nsource. This is clear from a study of \u2018the histories\u2019 and\n\u2018the dissections\u2019. (740a2\u201323, excerpted; compare\n735a12\u201326, 738b17\u201318 740a27\u201336, 742b34\u2013743a1,\n743b26)\n\n\nHaving developed this general explanation during his discussion of his\ncentral case, viviparous development, in GA II, Aristotle\nmoves on to egg-laying animals in book III. GA III 1 carries\nover to them whatever is common to the two cases, with discussion of\nthe development of birds in their eggs beginning in GA III 2.\nA recurring aspect of his argument, here as in PA, is to\nrefer us for descriptive details to the histories (presumably\nthe basis of our HA) and to a collection of representations\nof dissections (tragically not preserved, but cited repeatedly in\nAristotle\u2019s biological writings and in ancient catalogues of his\nwritings).\n\nThe most general differences among egg-layers relate to the\n\u2018completeness\u2019 of the egg when laid. Because birds lay\neggs that become hard as soon as they are exposed to the air\n(752a30-b2), they are taken to be better prepared when laid than the\neggs of other egg-laying animals. Ignoring much interesting and\nimportant detail, we will take up the discussion of development within\nthe eggs of birds as they incubate. Aristotle distinguishes the\n\u2018white\u2019 and the \u2018yolk\u2019, not descriptively as\nhe did in HA, but functionally (752b18\u201328).\n\n\u2026it is the white out of which the animal is constituted, while\nthe yolk becomes nutrient, and growth for the constitution of the\nparts is from it. This is also why the yolk and the white, having\ndistinct natures, have been kept distinct by membranes. For precise\ndetails concerning how these parts are situated in relation to each\nother in virtue of the sources of generation and the constitution of\nanimals, as well as the membranes and umbilical cords, one should\nstudy what has been outlined in the histories. The following appears\nto be sufficient for the present investigation: the heart is the first\nthing constituted; after this the great blood vessel is marked off,\nand two umbilical cords extend from this blood vessel, one to the\nmembrane around the yolk, the other to the membrane surrounding the\nanimal itself. This latter is thus next to the membrane of the shell.\n(753b11\u201323)\n\n\nIn this case (though not always) one does get far more detail in\nHA. These references to histories and dissections can be\nmisleading unless one takes into account the differences in the aims,\nand thus in the organization, of these treatises. In this case, for\nexample, nothing is said in GA about the heart \u2018beating\nand moving as though it were alive\u2019. As we saw, however,\nGA II stresses that in the development of live-bearing\nanimals, the heart is first to be formed, is ensouled from the start,\nand is the source of development for all the other parts\u2014a much\nmore \u2018theory-laden\u2019 characterization that stresses the\nheart\u2019s causal role in development. And because of the\norganizational structure of GA, much of what is said in his\ndiscussion of the live-bearing animals (those that are \u2018more\ncomplete\u2019 when they are born) is assumed to apply to animals\nthat lay eggs (that are \u2018less complete\u2019 when born).\n\nRecall the stunningly accurate discussion of the head and eyes of the\nfour day old chick embryo in HA (in section 5.1, above). This\nis not discussed in GA III 2; however in GA II 6, in\na long discussion of early organ formation in live-bearing\nanimals, Aristotle has a good deal to say on the subject:\n\nWhat happens concerning the eyes of animals presents a problem. For\nfrom the beginning, whether in land animals, swimmers or flyers, they\nappear very large and yet they are among the last of the parts to be\ncompleted and in the mean time contract in size. This is\nbecause the sense organs of the eyes are, as with the other sense\norgans, on channels; but while those for touch and taste are simply\nbodily, or some part of the body of animals, and those for smell and\nhearing are channels connected to the air outside and are full of\nconnate pneuma\u2026the eyes alone have a proper sensory body.\n(743b33\u2013744a6)\n\n\nThe full explanation goes on much longer, but we need not follow it\nout for the purposes of making two important points about the\nrelationship of GA to HA. The first is that the\norganization of GA dictates that for the explanation of facts\nof wide generality such as this one, we must look in book\nII\u2014notice that he claims that this explanation for the large\nsize of eyes early in development and for their subsequent contraction\napplies to all land, air and water animals. The second point to be\nstressed is the relentlessly causal/explanatory focus of the\nGA discussion, a feature (properly) completely absent in the\ncorresponding discussions in HA. As impressive as the\ndescriptive accuracy of the embryological passage cited earlier from\nHA is, we again need to remember what is absent from\nthat discussion. For the equally impressive embryological\ntheory, the reader of Aristotle\u2019s biology must turn to\nthe Generation of Animals.\n6. A Concluding Puzzle\n\nThis entry on Aristotle\u2019s biology and its philosophy closes with\na puzzle about the organization of his biological works when compared\nwith the remainder of the Aristotelian corpus. I began by noting that\nit is a fundamental aspect of Aristotle\u2019s theory of science that\ninvestigation proceeds from a stage where one establishes the\nexistence of the things being studied and the facts about them to a\nstage where the focus is on causal explanations by reference to the\nnatures and essences of those things. It seems clear that the\nbiological works honor this distinction, and do so self-consciously.\nYet Aristotle never suggests, in the Posterior Analytics or\nanywhere else, that these stages should be represented by distinct\ntreatises devoted to the same subject. Indeed, in no other domain\ndoes Aristotle do this: whether we look to meteorology, cosmology,\npsychology, ethics, drama or rhetoric, we find single treatises\npresenting both the facts and their explanation. Nor can this puzzle\nbe easily dismissed as an artifact of later editing\u2014as I have\npointed out a number of times, these treatises have a most interesting\nand consistent pattern of cross-referencing. The treatises that report\nthe results of causal investigations regularly refer to HA\n(and the dissections) for more detail regarding the facts being\nexplained; the HA, in contrast, never refers to the\ncausal treatises. Moreover, the striking avoidance in the Historia\nAnimalium of all of the concepts associated with\ndefinition and explanation cannot reasonably be laid at the feet of\nsome imagined later editor. We are left, then, to ponder what it was\nabout the investigation of animals that led Aristotle to take a\nmethodological distinction regarding stages of investigation\nand reify it in methodologically distinct treatises devoted to these\ndifferent stages.",
