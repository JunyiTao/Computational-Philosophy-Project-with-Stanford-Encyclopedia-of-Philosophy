    "main_text": "Models of (Epistemic) Reduction || Theory Reduction\n3.1 Theory Reduction\n\nAccording to theory reduction, theory \\(T_A\\) reduces \\(T_B\\)\n(e.g., \\(A\\)tomic physics reduces \\(B\\)iology) if \\(T_A\\) logically\nentails \\(T_B\\). Assuming a deductive-nomological account of\n explanation\n(Hempel and Oppenheim 1965 [1948]), theory reduction as deduction from\ntheoretical principles is an instance of explanation. In particular,\n\\(T_A\\) logically entails and explains the laws of \\(T_B\\). Compare\nthis with the logically weaker notion of reduction put forward by\nKemeny and Oppenheim (1956), which includes instances of theory\nreplacement. The Kemeny-Oppenheim model concerns the situation\nwhere the observable predictions made by \\(T_A\\) include (at least)\nall observable predictions of \\(T_B\\). In this case \\(T_A\\) can\nexplain everything that \\(T_B\\) explains, but \\(T_A\\) need not\nencompass the theoretical principles of \\(T_B\\) (as in genuine theory\nreduction), which allows for the possibility that \\(T_B\\) contains\ninadequate theoretical notions and is replaced by \\(T_A\\).\n\nMany models of theory reduction derive from the account of reduction\ndue to Ernest Nagel (1949, 1961). Working within the philosophical\nframework of logical empiricism, Nagel construed reduction as a\nlogical relation between theories, where a theory is understood as a\nsystem of statements, containing laws, formulated in a first-order\nformal language (Sarkar 2015). The reducing theory \\(T_A\\)\nreduces the reduced theory \\(T_B\\) if the laws of \\(T_B\\) can\nbe logically derived from \\(T_A\\), which Nagel called the\n\u201ccondition of derivability\u201d. However, if \\(T_B\\) contains\nscientific terms that do not occur in the language of the reducing\ntheory \\(T_A\\) (\u201corganismal reproduction\u201d is not an\nexpression of biochemistry), then derivability presupposes that the\nprimitive expressions of \\(T_B\\) (in particular, its predicates) can\nbe logically related to the language of \\(T_A\\). Nagel made this\nexplicit by a \u201ccondition of connectability\u201d: reduction\npresupposes that there are statements (e.g., conditionals) that\ncontain expressions both from \\(T_A\\) and \\(T_B\\), such that \\(T_A\\)\ntogether with these statements entail the laws of \\(T_B\\). These\nconnectability statements are often called bridge principles\n(or correspondence rules, or reduction functions), and have been\ninterpreted diversely. Nagel rejected the idea that bridge principles\nare analytic statements, but did not take a stand as to whether they\nare factual or conventional. Some philosophers have required that\nbridge principles are laws (rather than accidental generalizations),\nwhereas others have maintained that they should express metaphysical\nidentities between entities, properties, and processes (e.g.,\nidentifying cells with collections of molecules, in line with\nontological reduction). Nagel himself construed reduction as an\nepistemic notion without ontological commitment; nor did he require\nthat bridge statements be biconditionals\u2014mere conditionals when\nconjoined with \\(T_A\\) sometimes logically entail \\(T_B\\). (The\nKemeny-Oppenheim notion of reduction / theory replacement is weaker\nthan Nagelian reduction as it does not require such bridge principles\nconnecting \\(T_A\\) and \\(T_B\\).)\n\n\n This account covers interlevel theory reduction. For\ninstance, Oppenheim and Putnam (1958) argued for a hierarchical or\nlayered model of scientific disciplines that assumes each layer or\nlevel corresponds to a theory. Each discipline is reducible to the\ntheory on the next lower level, e.g., sociology to organismal biology,\norganismal biology to molecular biology, molecular biology to\nchemistry, and chemistry to microphysics (see also Brooks et al. 2021,\nWalter and Eronen 2011). Another way to apply Nagel\u2019s general\nmodel is successional theory reduction, where a historically\nearlier theory is reduced to a later, more mature theory, so that\nreduction can be an instance of theoretical progress (Nickles 1973).\nIn both cases, Nagel held that theories needed to be indexed to a\nparticular time: \u201cThe question whether a given science is\nreducible to another cannot in the abstract be usefully raised without\nreference to some particular stage of development of the two\ndisciplines\u201d (1961, 361).\n Paul Feyerabend\n (1962, 1965a, 1965b) and\n Thomas Kuhn\n (1962) criticized successional theory reduction and especially\nNagel\u2019s connectability condition. Feyerabend argued that an\nearlier and later theory might use the same theoretical term with a\ndifferent meaning (e.g., \u201cmass\u201d in classical and\nrelativistic mechanics). This\n incommensurability\n of meaning makes the connectability of these theories\u2019\nexpressions, and thus the logical derivation of one theory from\nanother, impossible. Whether or not genuine incommensurability obtains\nis controversial (see, e.g., Sankey 1994).\n\nNagel\u2019s model was revised and applied in a specifically\nbiological context\u2014the reduction of classical genetics to\nbiochemistry\u2014by Kenneth Schaffner (1967, 1969, 1976; see\nSchaffner 1993 for his mature account). Schaffner\u2019s\n\u201cGeneral Reduction Model\u201d addresses a key drawback of\nNagel\u2019s account, first noted by Feyerabend: even though the\ntheory to be reduced may be approximately true, it might contain\nempirically false statements, especially if it is a historical\nprecursor of the more mature reducing theory (e.g., the inheritance\n\u201claws\u201d of classical genetics have exceptions). If the\ntheory to be reduced \\((T_B)\\) contains false statements, then it\ncannot possibly be deduced from \\(T_A\\). For this reason, Schaffner\nconsiders instead \\(T_{B^*}\\), which is a corrected version\nof the theory to be reduced in that \\(T_{B^*}\\) makes more adequate\npredictions than \\(T_B\\). On this model, reduction occurs if \\(T_A\\)\nand \\(T_{B^*}\\) can be related by reduction functions (bridge\nprinciples) and \\(T_{B^*}\\) follows logically from \\(T_A\\) enriched by\nthe reduction functions.  (Whereas Nagel focused on the laws of\n\\(T_B\\) being deducible from \\(T_A\\), Schaffner requires that all\nstatements of \\(T_B /T_{B^*}\\) be deducible from \\(T_A\\).)\nSchaffner\u2019s central tenet about reduction in biology is that the\nsuccess of\n molecular biology\n shows that classical genetics and traditional fields of experimental\nbiology are in the process of being reduced to biochemistry. Although\nthis reduction has not been completed yet, a logical derivation of\ntraditional experimental biology from a (completed) theory of\nbiochemistry is in principle possible and will be achieved\neventually. Schaffner\u2019s account has an ontological aspect in\nthat he interprets the reduction functions as synthetic statements\nexpressing identities between the entities and processes of the two\ndomains related (in line with Sklar 1967 and Causey 1972a, 1972b),\nthough he does not argue that these identities are metaphysical\nnecessities. The Nagel-Schaffner approach to theory reduction assumes\na syntactic account of\n theory structure\n such that they are axiomatized systems formalizable in first order\npredicate calculus. A variety of other models of theory reduction\nexist, some of which use a semantic (i.e., theories as families of\n models)\n rather than a syntactic account of scientific theories (see Balzer\nand Dawe 1986a,b, Hooker 1981, Suppes 1957, Woodger 1952).\n\n\n Schaffner\u2019s account provided the motivation and point of\ndeparture for much of the reduction debate in philosophy of biology,\nwhich was conducted primarily in the 1970s and 80s and revolved around\nthe issue of whether (and in which sense)\n classical genetics can be reduced to molecular genetics\n or biochemistry. Three criticisms pertaining specifically to the\nNagel-Schaffner model bear mentioning.\n (Section 4\n reviews the main objections to different models of reduction more\ngenerally.)\n\n(a) Michael Ruse (1971) and David Hull (1974) argued that the relation\nbetween classical and molecular genetics is one of theory replacement,\nnot reduction in Schaffner\u2019s sense. Although Schaffner\u2019s\naccount permits a correction of the theory to be reduced \\((T_{B^*}\\)\ninstead of \\(T_B)\\), it is not clear when a modified version\n\\(T_{B^*}\\) (corrected \u201cclassical genetics\u201d) still counts\nas being largely similar to \\(T_B\\) (classical genetics). This leaves\nan ambiguity of whether one should conclude that \\(T_B\\) was reduced\nbecause \\(T_{B^*}\\) is similar enough or that \\(T_B\\) has been\nreplaced by another theory because the two are so dissimilar (Hull\n1976, Ruse 1976). Schaffner only requires that \\(T_B\\) and \\(T_{B^*}\\)\nare \u201cstrongly analogous\u201d (1993, 429), without offering a\nspecification of how much similarity is required for reduction rather\nthan replacement (Winther 2009). William Wimsatt (1976b) emphasizes\nthat while interlevel, compositional reductions are transitive,\nsuccessional reductions through history are intransitive, so that a\ncontinuum between genuine successional reduction and replacement\nobtains. Any sequence of successive reductions can be expected to\nevolve into an instance of replacement given enough time.\n\n(b) Nagel and Schaffner relied on a\n syntactic construal of theories,\n which assumes that a theory is a set of statements in a formal\nlanguage, including laws (Kitcher 1984). Yet it has been argued that\nmolecular biology as the reducing theory does not consist of a small\nbody of laws, so that a covering-law model of explanation and\nreduction is not applicable (Culp and Kitcher 1989, Kitcher 1984,\nSarkar 1998). If molecular biology or other biological fields are\ninadequately represented as consisting of a clearly delineated theory,\nreconstructed as a set of statements in a formal language, then an\naccount of reduction that presupposes this construal of scientific\ntheories is problematic.\n\n(c) Hull (1976), Wimsatt (1976a, 1976b), and Sahotra Sarkar (1992,\n1998) have objected that Schaffner focuses too much on formal\nconsiderations about reduction, rather than substantive issues. His\naccount construes reduction as a logical relation that is \u201cin\nprinciple\u201d possible even though it is not occurring in practice.\nIf reduction in this sense is not occurring in biology, then there are\nsignificant questions about whether it best fits biological knowledge\nand practice. Nagel claimed that premature attempts at reduction could\nretard scientific progress, thus implicitly decoupling methodological\ndemands from epistemological ones (Nagel 1961, 362\u20133). Schaffner\n(1974, 1993) acknowledges that reductionism in his sense has been\nperipheral to the practice of molecular biology, but maintains that\nhis formal model of reduction captures the reduction relation between\ntheories. Wimsatt (1979) suggests that Nagel\u2019s and\nSchaffner\u2019s focus on in-principle considerations and the context\nof justification, to the exclusion of in-practice considerations and\nthe context of discovery, leads to misunderstandings about the nature\nof reductionism debates, including historical and current controversy\namong scientists (see\n Section 2).\n Reduction may obtain between classical and molecular genetics, but\nnot in the sense of Nagel\u2019s or Schaffner\u2019s logical\nempiricist approach (Hull 1974).\n",
