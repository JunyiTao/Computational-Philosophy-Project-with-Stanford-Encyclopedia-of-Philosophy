    "main_text": "The Two Treatises Of Government || Of War and Slavery\n4.3 Of War and Slavery\n\nIn chapters 3 and 4, Locke defines the states of war and slavery. The\nstate of war is a state in which someone has a sedate and settled\nintention of violating someone\u2019s right to life (and thus all\ntheir other rights). Such a person puts themselves into a state of war\nwith the person whose life they intend to take. In such a war the\nperson who intends to violate someone\u2019s right to life is an\nunjust aggressor. This is not the normal relationship between people\nenjoined by the law of nature in the state of nature. Locke is\ndistancing himself from Hobbes who had made the state of nature and\nthe state of war equivalent terms. For Locke, the state of nature is\nordinarily one in which we follow the Golden Rule interpreted in terms\nof natural rights, and thus love our fellow human creatures. The state\nof war only comes about when someone proposes to violate someone\nelse\u2019s rights. Thus, on Locke\u2019s theory of war, there will\nalways be an innocent victim on one side and an unjust aggressor on\nthe other.\n\nSlavery is the state of being in the absolute or arbitrary power of\nanother. On Locke\u2019s definition of slavery, there is only one\nrather remarkable way to become a legitimate slave. In order to do so,\none must be an unjust aggressor defeated in war. The just victor then\nhas the option to either kill the aggressor or enslave them. Locke\ntells us that the state of slavery is the continuation of the state of\nwar between a lawful conqueror and a captive, in which the conqueror\ndelays taking the life of the captive, and instead makes use of him.\nThis is a continued war because if conqueror and captive make some\ncompact for obedience on the one side and limited power on the other,\nthe state of slavery ceases and becomes a relation between a master\nand a servant in which the master only has limited power over his\nservant. The reason that slavery ceases with the compact is that\n\u201cno man, can, by agreement pass over to another that which he\nhath not in himself, a power over his own life\u201d\n(Treatises II.4.24). Legitimate slavery is an important\nconcept in Locke\u2019s political philosophy largely because it tells\nus what the legitimate extent of despotic power is and defines and\nilluminates by contrast the nature of illegitimate slavery.\nIllegitimate slavery is that state in which someone possesses absolute\nor despotic power over someone else without just cause. Locke holds\nthat it is this illegitimate state of slavery which absolute monarchs\nwish to impose upon their subjects. It is very likely for this reason\nthat legitimate slavery is so narrowly defined. This shows that the\nchapter on slavery plays a crucial role in Locke\u2019s argument\nagainst Sir Robert Filmer and thus could not have been easily\ndispensed with. Still, it is possible that Locke had an additional\npurpose or perhaps a quite different reason for writing about\nslavery.\n\nThere has been a steady stream of articles and books over the last\nsixty years arguing that given Locke\u2019s involvement with trade\nand colonial government, the theory of slavery in the Second\nTreatise was intended to justify the institutions and practices\nof Afro-American slavery. If this were the case, Locke\u2019s\nphilosophy would not contradict his actions as an investor and\ncolonial administrator. However, there are strong objections to this\nview. Had he intended to justify Afro-American slavery, Locke would\nhave done much better with a vastly more inclusive definition of\nlegitimate slavery than the one he gives. It is sometimes suggested\nthat Locke\u2019s account of \u201cjust war\u201d is so vague that\nit could easily be twisted to justify the institutions and practices\nof Afro-American slavery. This, however, is also not the case. In the\nchapter \u201cOf Conquest\u201d Locke explicitly lists the limits of\nthe legitimate power of conquerors. These limits on who can become a\nlegitimate slave and what the powers of a just conqueror are ensure\nthat this theory of conquest and slavery would condemn the\ninstitutions and practices of Afro-American slavery in the\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Nonetheless, the\ndebate continues. One element of the debate has to do with\nLocke\u2019s role in the writing of the Fundamental Constitutions\nof the Carolinas. David Armitage in his 2004 article \u201cJohn\nLocke, Carolina and the Two Treatises of Government\u201d argues that\nLocke was involved in a revision of the Fundamental Constitution\nof the Carolinas at the very time he was writing The Two\nTreatises of Government. The provision that \u201cEvery Freedman\nof the Carolinas has absolute power and authority over his negro\nslaves\u201d remained in the document unchanged. In his 2016 book\nThe Ashley Cooper Plan, Thomas Wilson gives a detailed\naccount of Ashley Cooper\u2019s intentions for the Carolina colony\nand how Cooper\u2019s intent was thwarted by Barbadian slave owners\nwho changed Carolina society from a society with slaves to a slave\nsociety. L. H. Roper, in his 2004 book Conceiving Carolina:\nProperty, Planters and Plots 1662\u20131729, offers a different\naccount of what went wrong, focusing on conflicts over the trade in\nIndian slaves. James Farr\u2019s article \u201cLocke, Natural Law\nand New World Slavery\u201d (2008) is one of the best statements of\nthe position that Locke intended his theory of slavery to apply to\nEnglish absolutism and not Afro-American slavery while noting that\nLocke\u2019s involvement with slavery has ruined his reputation as\nthe great champion of liberty Roger Woolhouse in his recent biography\nof Locke (Woolhouse 2007: 187) remarks that \u201cThough there is no\nconsensus on the whole question, there certainly seems to be \u2018a\nglaring contradiction between his theories and Afro-American\nslavery\u2019\u201d.\n\nRecently, there has been a debate over whose theory of slavery and\nabsolutism Locke was attacking. Johan Olsthoorn and Laurens van\nApeldoorn (2020) argue that Locke\u2019s account of slavery and in\nparticular, that no person can consensually establish absolute rule\nover themselves with all its consequences has little force against\nother classical contract theories, in particular those of Grotius and\nPuffendorf. Both Grotius and Puffendorf defended both absolutism and\ncolonial slavery.\n\nFelis Waldmann in \u201cSlavery and Absolutism in Locke\u2019s Two\nTreatises: A Response to Olsthoorn and van Apeldoorn\u201d objects to\na number of their claims finding others not relevant. Most\nnotably, he objects to these claims: First, \u201cLocke is working\nwith an idiosyncratic conception of slavery and absolute rule\nrepudiated by prominent early modern thinkers defending political\nabsolutism.\u201d Second: \u201cLike Filmer, Locke maintains that\nabsolute rulers may arbitrarily kill and maim their subjects at will,\nby dint of having a dominium in the latter\u2019s\nlives.\u201d Finally, he objects to the claim that: \u201cEarly\nmodern natural lawyers, from Grotius onward, conceptualized slavery\nrather differently, insisting that enslaved people were not\nowned in the way we own things (which may be destroyed at\nwill)\u201d (Waldmann 7).\n\nIn brief, Waldmann\u2019s response to the first claim is that Filmer\naccurately represented the Royalist position in the late 1670s and\nearly 1680s and so Locke\u2019s account is not a straw man. Thus,\nLocke is attacking Filmer\u2019s account of slavery and not some weak\nand extreme version of the argument for absolutism that no one\nheld. Waldmann suggests that the second claim magnifies this tendency\nof the two authors\u2019 portrayal of Locke\u2019s argument as not\nresponding to the standard arguments for absolutism. Thus, Olsthoorn\nand van Apeldoorn attribute Filmer\u2019s position to Locke. Waldmann\nconcludes that the claims of Olsthoorn and van Apeldoorn that since\nLocke\u2019s position on slavery was significantly different from\nthose of Grotius and Puffendorf, it had little force against them is,\nin fact, the case.  But he thinks this is of little importance since\nLocke was not arguing against them. One suggestion he considers\nplausible is that Locke is aiming his argument against the possibility\nof self-enslavement at Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes was recognized by his\ncontemporaries as asserting both that one could by contract enslave\noneself and that the king had dominium, over his\nsubjects.\n\nWilliam Uzgalis, in his 2017 chapter \u201cJohn Locke, Slavery and\nIndian Lands,\u201d holds that Locke has two theories of slavery, one\nof them of legitimate slavery and the other of illegitimate\nslavery. Note that the authors discussed above simply\ndon\u2019t make this distinction. If they had, it would be\nplain that while Locke shares with Filmer the dominium\nconception of slavery that allows a master to kill or maim a slave,\nneither theory belongs to Filmer, and if Locke is correct about royal\nabsolutism and given the character of the practices of the slave\ntrade and colonial slavery, both absolutism at home and the slave\ntrade and colonial slavery fall under the theory of illegitimate\nslavery. Neither Grotius, Puffendorf or Hobbes has an explicit\ntheory of illegitimate slavery. Uzgalis also notes that Grotius and\nPuffendorf provided claims that Locke could have adopted had he wished\nto justify the slave trade and slavery in the colonies. Still, he\ndenies them all, and with good reason. He would have\nsubstantially weakened his argument against the kind of absolutism he\nattributed to Filmer and the Stuarts had he done so. This\nsuggests that he was crafting an alternative theory and not arguing\nagainst its competitors, with the exception, perhaps, of Hobbes.\n\nHolly Brewer in her 2017 article \u201cSlavery, Sovereignty, and\n\u2018Inheritable Blood\u2019, Reconsidering John Locke and the\nOrigins of American Slavery\u201d argues for a different approach\nto these questions. She presents evidence that the Stuart\nkings, and Charles II and his brother James, Duke of York, in\nparticular, were not just interested in absolute government at home;\nthey actively promoted the Royal Africa Company, the slave trade and\nslavery in the colonies as it provided considerable amounts of money\nto the royal coffers. James was the Governor (the President) of the\nRoyal Africa Company and Admiral of the English fleet. Lord\nShaftesbury, Locke\u2019s patron, was the sub-governor, and Locke\nassisted him. Using the fleet, James attacked and captured Dutch forts\non the coast of Africa to make bases for the Royal Africa Company and\ndeprive the Dutch of them. The Stuarts minted guinea coins to\ncelebrate these efforts. After becoming King, James continued as\nGovernor of the Royal Africa Company. Thus Brewer underlines the\nsimilarities and connections between the absolutism Locke objected to\nat home and the slave trade and slavery in the colonies. She argues\nthat the spread of slavery needs to be understood as an English\nimperial policy and not something that occurred in different times and\nplaces unconnected with one another. She also claims that while Locke\nwas a member of King William III\u2019s Board of Trade in the waning\nyears of the seventeenth century, he sought to undo Stuart policies\nconcerning slavery in the colonies.\n",
