    "preamble": "\n\nTo forgive is to respond in a particular way to someone who has\ntreated someone badly or wrongly. Forgiveness is therefore a dyadic\nrelation involving a wrongdoer and a wronged party, and is thought to\nbe a way in which victims of wrongdoing alter both their and a\nwrongdoer\u2019s status by, for instance, acknowledging yet moving\npast a moral transgression. Commonly, forgiveness is thought to\ninvolve the giving up of certain negative emotions towards the\nwrongdoer, the forbearance of negative reactions against the\nwrongdoer, and possibly the restoration of the relationship with the\nwrongdoer. Much philosophical discussion of forgiveness centers on\nthree primary questions: (1) What is the nature of\nforgiveness\u2014what must one do in order to forgive; (2) Who has\nstanding to forgive\u2014when is one in a position to forgive a\nwrongdoer; and (3) What are the norms governing forgiveness\u2014when\nis forgiveness morally good, right, or praiseworthy?\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Forgiveness as a Response to Wrongdoing\n\nAn inevitable and unfortunate fact of life is that we are often\nmistreated by others. Forgiveness concerns one kind of response to\nthose who wrong us. From the ancient Greeks to the present day,\nforgiveness has typically been regarded as a personal response to\nhaving been injured or wronged, or as a condition one seeks or hopes\nis bestowed upon one for having wronged someone else.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines\n\u2018forgivable\u2019, the first entry under the general term\n\u2018forgive\u2019, as that which \u201cmay be forgiven,\npardonable, excusable\u201d, referring thereby to the quality of\ndeserving to be forgiven. Notwithstanding the association with\nexcusing conditions, forgiving is not, strictly speaking, equivalent\nto excusing. For wrongdoing that is excused entirely, there is nothing\nto forgive, since (as we shall see) agents who are fully excused are\nnot blameworthy or culpable. Moreover, the application of the concept\nof forgiveness to non-moral behavior, as in the case of a forgivably\npoor musical performance by a pianist, shows that forgiveness is not\nalways or necessarily a moral term. For this reason, there may be\nsimilar practices of forgiveness in non-moral arenas of normative\nappraisal (Haji 1998). However, we shall focus here on forgiveness as\nit pertains to moral appraisal and moral responsibility. Further,\nwhile most of our discussion will be focused on forgiveness for\nconduct, we note the possibility that one may also be forgiven for\none\u2019s character or the kind of person one is (Bell 2008).\n2. Cognate Phenomena\n2.1 Justification\n\nSometimes we do things that appear to be morally wrong. Suppose I see\nyou, a total stranger, take a pear from a fruit stand and walk off\nwith it. I reproach you for having stolen the pear into which you are\nnow happily chomping. Yet you explain that you own that fruit stand\nand have not stolen anything. In giving this kind of explanation, you\nare offering a justification for your action\u2014you are claiming\nthat despite appearances to the contrary, your taking the pear was\nmorally permissible. Offering justifications is commonplace in our\nmoral lives. But justification and forgiveness ought to be\ndistinguished. When conduct is justified, this implies that the\nconduct was not morally wrong. But when conduct is forgiven, there is\nno such implication. Indeed, in most cases (if not all), what we are\nforgiven for are the morally wrong things we do. This is why it can be\noffensive when someone says that she forgives you when you have done\nnothing wrong.\n2.2 Excuse\n\nSometimes we do things that are indeed morally bad or impermissible,\nbut for which we are not morally blameworthy. In such cases, so-called\nexcusing conditions render an otherwise blameworthy agent not\nblameworthy. Recall our pear-taker. Suppose that you take the\npear, not from your own fruit stand, but from your neighbor\u2019s.\nYou have done something that you ought not to have done. Even so,\nthere may be facts about you or the context of your action that make\nit the case that you are not morally responsible and blameworthy. When\nwe draw attention to these facts\u2014that is, when we offer an\nexcuse for our action\u2014we are not claiming that what we did was\nnot morally wrong. Rather, we concede that what we did was morally\nwrong, but we provide putative reasons for thinking that we are not\nmorally responsible and blameworthy for having done so.\n\nWhen conduct is excused, this entails that the agent who so acted is\nnot morally responsible and blameworthy for that conduct. But when one\nis forgiven for one\u2019s conduct, this does not entail\nthat the wrongdoer was not morally responsible and blameworthy for her\nconduct. It is often claimed that a necessary condition for\nforgiveness is that the wrongdoer is morally blameworthy for her\nconduct (see, e.g., Bash 2007: 5; Haber 1991: 33; Murphy 2003; Allais\n2008; and Hieronymi 2001). Perhaps this is true (although see Gamlund\n2011). But we need not insist, as a matter of conceptual necessity,\nthat forgiveness requires that agents be morally blameworthy in order\nto show how forgiveness and excuse are distinct. For even if\nthere are certain cases in which one can be forgiven for non-culpably\nhaving done wrong (say, in moral dilemma cases), this does not change\nthe fact that forgiven agents can be morally responsible and\nblameworthy but that agents who are excused are not morally\nresponsible and blameworthy.\n2.3 Condonation\n\nThere are many ways to respond to wrongdoers who are blameworthy for\ntheir conduct. One such way is to condone their conduct\n(Hughes 1995). \u201cBroadly speaking, to condone\u201d, writes\nCharles Griswold, \u201cis to collaborate in the lack of censure of\nan action, and perhaps to enable further wrong-doing by the\noffender\u201d (2007: 46). What is it to collaborate in the lack of\ncensure of an action? Griswold makes two suggestions: \n\n\nOne may condone in the sense of accepting while not disapproving (by\nnot holding the wrong-doing against its author), or in the sense of\ntolerating while disapproving (a sort of \u201clook the other\nway\u201d or \u201cputting up with\u201d strategy). (2007:\n46\u20137) \n\n\nWe can call the first kind of condoning\u2014the one that involves\naccepting and not disapproving of\nconduct\u2014A-condonation. We can call the second kind of\ncondonation\u2014the kind that involves disapproving of but\ntolerating conduct\u2014D-condonation. A brief discussion can\nhelp us to see how each differs from forgiveness.\n\nAccording to Garrard and McNaughton, when \n\n\nwe condone an action, we say in effect that it wasn\u2019t really\nsuch a bad thing to do [\u2026] Condoning an action amounts to\nsaying (correctly or incorrectly) that the action wasn\u2019t really\nwrong. (2010: 85) \n\n\nJean Hampton also seems to have something like A-condonation in\nmind:\n\n\nI will define \u2018condonation\u2019 as the acceptance, without\nmoral protest (either inward or outward), of an action which ought to\nwarrant such protest, made possible, first, by ridding oneself of the\njudgement that the action is wrong, so that its performer cannot be a\nwrongdoer, and, second, by ridding oneself of any of attendant\nfeelings (such as those which are involved in resentment) which\nsignify one\u2019s protest of the action. (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n40)\n\n\nIn order to forgive, however, the victim must represent the putative\nrecipient of forgiveness as one who did something morally wrong (or\nbad or vicious).\n\nD-condonation occurs when an agent disapproves of someone\u2019s\nconduct, but tolerates it. Griswold characterizes it as a sort of\n\u201clook the other way\u201d or \u201cputting up with\u201d\nstrategy (2007). The forgiver, by contrast, does not paper over\nwrongdoing\u2014she is prepared to blame, but forgoes it.\n\nTwo other considerations help distinguish condoning from forgiving.\nFirst, under typical circumstances, we can condone actions that are\nnot wrongs against us (Haber 1991: 59\u201360). We cannot, however,\nat least in typical circumstances, forgive others for their wrongs\nagainst others. Second, while we forgive agents for their\nconduct (or perhaps their characters), when we condone, we condone\nthe conduct (or the character). It is infelicitous to say,\n\u201cI condone you for lying to me\u201d whereas it makes perfect\nsense to say, \u201cI forgive you for lying to me\u201d.\n2.4 Pardon and Mercy\n\nThe phrase \u201cpardon me\u201d frequently functions as an apology,\nwhich might precede an act of forgiveness, or be a plea or request for\nforgiveness, or some similar act of forbearance. And to pardon a\nwrongdoer often seems indistinguishable from forgiveness, perhaps\nespecially in cases of minor wrong. However, the concept of pardon\nalso refers to a familiar and important legal and political power\nquite unlike forgiveness. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines this\nsense of pardon as \u201can act or an instance of officially\nnullifying punishment or other legal consequences of a crime\u201d,\nordinarily \u201cgranted by the chief executive of a\ngovernment\u201d (Garner 1999: 1137). In the United States, for\nexample, the President has the authority to grant pardons for federal\noffenses, and state governors may pardon crimes against the state.\n\nAlthough reasons for exercising the power of pardon often mimic those\ngiven for forgiving wrongdoers, one clear difference between pardon\nand forgiving is that the former is typically exercised by\nthird-parties as opposed to the victims of wrong. As discussed below,\nstandard philosophical views maintain that there are good reasons for\nthinking that, with one important exception, third-party forgiveness\nis impossible, inasmuch as forgiveness is the prerogative or right of\nthe victim of wrong.  Another difference is that a central idea in the\nlegal and political concept of pardon is that of an offer that must be\naccepted in order to accomplish its partial or complete end, such as\nmitigation of a criminal punishment via commutation of a prison\nsentence (Bingham 2009). Although on some views forgiveness is also an\noffer, especially where reconciliation between a victim and wrongdoer\nis attempted (Tombs 2008), the main sense of forgiveness seems not to\ninvolve the idea of an offer at all, let alone an offer that must be\naccepted by the wrongdoer in order for forgiveness to occur and\naccomplish at least some of its ends, for example to discharge\none\u2019s duty to forgive others as commanded by God, or to move\nbeyond a potentially paralyzing negative emotion.\n\nFurthermore, acts of mercy in general are to be distinguished from\nacts of forgiveness (Murphy 1988; Murphy & Hampton 1988; Tosi\n& Warmke 2017). First, manifestations of mercy, but not\nforgiveness, are essentially overt. To extend or show mercy to someone\nwho has acted badly is to engage in some overt behavior: a parent may\nlessen a guilty child\u2019s punishment. Forgiveness, however, is not\nnecessarily overt. It is possible to forgive privately; indeed\nphilosophical discussions of forgiveness have focused predominantly on\nits private manifestations. Second, mercy is third-personal in a way\nthat forgiveness is not. A boss may reprimand an employee for telling\nan inappropriate joke in the lunchroom even though termination would\nbe justified and the boss herself is not personally offended by it.\nHere, a third-party shows mercy, and does so (we may presume)\njustifiably. But forgiveness, if it is ever third-personal, is not\nthird-personal in this way. Barring exceptional\ncircumstances, you cannot forgive me for the offense I caused to a\nco-worker\u2014you simply lack the standing to forgive me for my\noffense to her. Mercy is not paradigmatically second-personal\nin this way. Third, mercy is often (if not always) connected to\nauthority in a way that forgiveness is not. It is natural to think\nthat in order for S to show mercy to P, S must be in some\nkind of position of authority over P. Interpersonal forgiveness,\nhowever, is tied to no such authority structures.\n2.5 Reconciliation\n\nWhen we are wronged, this typically damages our relationship with the\nwrongdoer. Minor offenses might put strains on relationships that put\nburdens on both persons involved; serious offenses might lead the\nvictim to terminate the relationship altogether. Further, when we\nblame others for their wrongs against us, we often do so at the cost\nof causing further relational damage. We might withhold expressions of\ngood-will, or alter our behavior in ways that make clear that we no\nlonger trust the other.\n\nAlthough in many cases forgiveness will be accompanied by\nreconciliation, it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for\nforgiveness. One reason for thinking that reconciliation is not\nnecessary for forgiveness is that the offending party may be, for\nwhatever reasons, unwilling to reconcile. But the fact that I am\nunwilling to restore our relationship does not, all by itself, make it\nimpossible for you forgive me for the wrong I did to you. In other\ncases, reconciliation is practically impossible. Perhaps I have\nsecretly moved to Fiji and you have no way to get in touch with me.\nYou can forgive me whether or not you know I am in Fiji. In still\nother cases, restoring a relationship would be \u201cmorally\nunwise\u201d, as Jean Hampton puts it (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n42\u20133, fn. 9). Doing so might expose one to additional\npsychological damage, for example. Neither does reconciliation appear\nto be sufficient for forgiveness. Relationships may be restored, at\nleast to some degree, for purely pragmatic reasons.\n3. The Ends of Forgiveness\n\nEven if reconciliation is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nforgiveness, we can still recognize that reconciliation is, as Robert\nRoberts (1995) puts it, the \u201cteleology of forgiveness\u201d.\nAll things being equal, reconciliation is the goal to which\nforgiveness points. Although there are reasons that sometimes make\nreconciliation impossible or unwise, forgiveness is oriented towards\npromoting pro-sociality and friendly relations (McCullough 2008: 114,\n116). In some cases, this might mean that the end of forgiveness is to\nrepair a relationship to its ex ante state. In some cases,\nhowever, only partial reconciliation may occur. In such cases, the\nnature of the restored relationship should be \u201cappropriate to\nthe situation of the parties after they have forgiven one\nanother\u201d (Bash 2007: 25).\n\nCommon conceptions of forgiveness make clear that its main purpose is\nthe re-establishment or resumption of a relationship ruptured by\nwrongdoing. In keeping with the common conceptions of forgiveness,\nmany contemporary philosophers argue that the resumption of\nrelationships disrupted by wrongdoing often requires a moral\nreassessment of the wrongdoer by the victim, and that such a\nreassessment involves relinquishing resentment or some other form of\nmorally inflected anger (Murphy & Hampton 1988; Murphy 2001), or\nbehavior such as seeking revenge (Griswold 2007; Zaibert 2009; Govier\n2002; Hughes 2016).\n\nMaintaining or perpetuating personal relationships is one of the\nclearest and most important ends of forgiveness, though not the only\nimportant one. Forgiving those who wrong us often helps us move beyond\nstrong negative emotions which, if allowed to fester, could harm us\npsychologically and physically. Forgiveness benefits wrongdoers, as\nwell, by releasing them from the blame and hard feelings often\ndirected toward them by those they wrong, or helping them transcend\nthe guilt or remorse they suffer from having done wrong, thereby\nallowing them to move forward in their lives. These ends of\nforgiveness may be regarded as in general enabling in the sense that\nthey show how forgiveness sometimes helps people move beyond the\nwrongs they endure or cause and the sometimes debilitating effects\nthose wrongs have on wrongdoers and victims alike. For some,\nforgiveness has these forward-looking benefits because of the way it\ntransfigures the past. Emmanuel Levinas claims that \u201cforgiveness\nacts upon the past, somehow repeats the event, purifying it\u201d\n([1961] 1969: 283), a notion similar to Hannah Arendt\u2019s view\nthat forgiveness alters the ethical significance of a\nwrongdoer\u2019s past by keeping it from having a permanent or fixed\ncharacter (Arendt 1958).\n4. Standing to Forgive\n\nIt is standard to assume that not just anyone can forgive a wrongdoer\nfor a certain wrong. One must have \u201cstanding\u201d. If I\nlack standing, then forgiving is not on the table for me; I\nam not a candidate for forgiving. And so to doubt whether someone has\nstanding to forgive is not to doubt whether someone succeeded in\nforgiving. Nor is it to doubt whether someone\u2019s forgiveness was\nmorally good, right or permissible. Rather, it is to doubt whether\nthat person can forgive in the first place.\n\nWho has standing to forgive? It might be thought that one has standing\nonly if one is the victim of wrongdoing (in some sense of\n\u2018victim\u2019). Jeffrie Murphy expresses such a view when he\nsays that \n\n\nI do not have standing to resent or forgive you unless I have\nmyself been the victim of your wrongdoing. I may forgive you for\nembezzling my funds; but it would be ludicrous for me, for example, to\nclaim that I had decided to forgive Hitler for what he did to the\nJews. I lack the proper standing for this. Thus, I may legitimately\nresent (and hence consider forgiving) only wrong done to me.\n(Murphy & Hampton 1988: 21, emphasis original) \n\n\nOn this view, only those who have been directly wronged have standing\nto forgive. Suppose Alfred lies to Betty. Betty is thereby directly\nwronged by Alfred. Though we will not attempt a full account of what\nit means to be directly wronged by someone, the general idea is that\nfor Betty to be directly wronged by Alfred means that Alfred\u2019s\nconduct itself constituted a wrong against Betty; he failed Betty,\nmorally speaking. Betty therefore has direct standing to forgive.\n\nSuppose, however, that Alfred lies to Betty and this results in Betty\nbeing very late in picking up her brother Todd. Alfred did not lie to\nTodd, but by lying to Betty, there is a straightforward sense\nin which this resulted in a wrong being done to Todd. Here, while we\ncan say that Betty was directly wronged and so has direct standing to\nforgive, it is not true that Todd was directly wronged by Alfred.\nRather, it was something Alfred did to Betty that led to Todd\u2019s\nbeing wronged indirectly. And because it would be fitting for\nTodd to blame Alfred, and for Alfred to apologize to Todd, it is\nplausible to think that Todd also has standing to forgive Alfred. Call\nthis indirect standing.\n\nThough controversial, it may be possible to have standing to forgive\nwhile lacking either direct or indirect standing. Such standing is\nimplicated in cases where one person forgives on behalf of\nsomeone else who has or would have had direct or indirect standing.\nSuppose Ted\u2019s adult daughter Maria is assaulted and left unable\nto communicate for the rest of her life. Supposing that Maria has\ndirect standing to forgive her assailant, if it is possible for Ted to\nforgive the assailant on behalf of Maria, he is able to do so in\nvirtue of possessing what we may call proxy standing.\n\nFinally, consider third-party standing. What is labeled\n\u201cthird-party\u201d forgiveness in the forgiveness literature is\noften a source of confusion. Charles Griswold rightly points out that\nsome kinds of cases of standing are misleadingly called\n\u201cthird-party\u201d. For example, he asks us to imagine a case\nin which the murder of a loved one injures us, and the matter of\nwhether to forgive presents itself to us in light of the loss\nwe\u2019ve sustained. \u201cThis sort of case\u201d, he says,\n\u201cis not a matter of third-party forgiveness\u201d (2007: 117).\nThe standing to forgive that would accrue to such a person, Griswold\nsays, would be (to put it in our above terminology) of the direct or\nindirect variety, depending on how the case is fleshed out.\nGriswold\u2019s own view of the matter is that third-party\nforgiveness involves \n\n\na situation in which the question of forgiveness arises in light of\nyour indignation at the loss suffered by another person, thanks to\nsomeone else\u2019s actions: here the matter concerns your forgiving\ntheir offender on their behalf for the harm done to them (not to you).\n(2007: 117) \n\n\nYet because Griswold has in mind an activity that involves forgiving\n\u201con behalf\u201d of the victim, this kind of standing to\nforgive might be best thought of as proxy standing. Indeed, he argues\nthat in order to engage in what he calls third-party\nforgiveness, the forgiver can only do so if she has\n\u201cstanding\u201d, and one receives such standing only if one has\nan \u201cidentification with the victim\u201d (119).\n\nWe identify as third-party standing what both Glen Pettigrove (2009)\nand Margaret Urban Walker (2013) have in mind in their recent\ndiscussions of third-party forgiveness. Such cases, Walker writes,\ninvolve \n\n\nthe scenario in which A forgives the offender B for\nsomething B did to the victim C, where A is not\nplausibly seen as a fellow victim, and where A forgives\nB on A\u2019s own behalf, not on behalf of C or\nanyone else who might be a victim of the wrong. (2013: 495) \n\n\nSuch a putative forgiver, she says, is one who \u201csuffered no\nwrong\u201d by the offender\u2019s actions (2013: 496). This\nputative standing to forgive, therefore, is not reducible to any of\nthe aforementioned varieties: the forgiver was not wronged by the\noffender (directly or indirectly), she does not forgive herself, and\nshe does not forgive on behalf of anyone else.\n5. Theories of Forgiveness\n5.1 Emotion Accounts\n\nIt is widely thought that forgiveness is fundamentally a matter of how\none feels about another. Jeffrie Murphy, for example, claims that\n\u201c[f]orgiveness is primarily a matter of how I feel\nabout you (not how I treat you)\u201d (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 21;\ncf. Hughes 1993: 108). Broadly speaking, emotion accounts of\nforgiveness claim that forgiveness is best understood as fundamentally\na change in emotion. According to such views, were you to be wronged,\nyour forgiving the wrongdoer fundamentally involves your overcoming\n(or abating, or eliminating, or forswearing) some relevant negative\nemotion (e.g., resentment, hatred, rancor) that you experience because\nyou were wronged. For example, Kathleen Dean Moore writes, that\n\u201cthe attitude of forgiveness is characterized by the presence of\ngood will and by the lack of personal resentment for the injury\u201d\n(1989:184). Norvin Richards claims that to \u201cforgive someone for\nhaving wronged one is to abandon all negative feelings based on the\nepisode in question\u201d (1988: 79). Stephen Darwall also appears to\ndefend some kind of emotion account when he says that to\n\u201cforgive is, roughly, to forbear or withdraw resentment\u201d\n(2006: 72). \n\nAmong the various emotion accounts, however, there is significant\ndisagreement on two main points: (1) about which specific emotions are\nimplicated in forgiveness; and (2) about what must be done with those\nemotions in order to forgive. We survey emotion accounts by taking\nthese two issues in turn.\n\nOne way to differentiate between the varieties of emotion accounts is\naccording to the emotion or set of emotions that are thought to be\nrelevant to forgiveness. A cursory survey of the forgiveness\nliterature might give one the impression that there is widespread\nagreement about which emotion is crucially implicated in forgiveness.\nThat emotion is resentment. The view that forgiveness crucially\nimplicates resentment is usually taken to be \u201creceived\northodoxy\u201d (Bash 2007: 161; cf. Kekes 2009: 490; Radzik 2009:\n117; and Zaibert 2009: 38). But any impression of wholesale agreement\nwould be mistaken for two reasons. First, some emotion theorists argue\nthat overcoming resentment is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nforgiveness. Such emotion theorists hold that in forgiving there are\nother emotions that may or must be overcome. And second, even\namong those who hold that overcoming resentment is either necessary or\nsufficient for forgiveness, there is disagreement about what\nresentment is. Some think of resentment as a \u201chostile\nfeeling\u201d which aims at inflicting harm on the wrongdoer (Garrard\n& McNaughton 2002), while others think of it as a kind of\n\u201cmoral protest\u201d (Hieronymi 2001), while still others think\nof resentment as the paradigmatic sort of \u201cmoral anger\u201d\n(Hughes 1993). Whereas some describe resentment as a\n\u201cvindictive passion\u201d (Murphy 2003: 16) others claim that\nresentment \u201cneed not entail motivation to retaliate for the\nwrong\u201d (Holmgren 2012: 31). In recent work, Jeffrey Blustein\ndescribes resentment as being a member of a class of attitudes that\nare \u201cfeelings of insult\u201d (2014: 33; cf. Murphy &\nHampton 1988: 44\u20135).\n\nIt is difficult to know what exactly these characterizations of\nresentment amount to, what kinds of relations hold between them, and\nperhaps most importantly, which view is correct. Indeed, this is one\nof the more troublesome aspects of the philosophical literature on\nforgiveness: while it is commonly thought that forgiveness crucially\nimplicates resentment, there is no such consensus about what\nresentment is (contra Holmgren 2012: 35). And as we\nhave already noted, even though resentment is widely thought to be the\ncentral or paradigmatic emotion that forgiveness implicates, not all\nemotional accounts accept that view.\n\nSo here is a rough and ready way of categorizing the various emotion\naccounts as regards the set of relevant emotions that forgiveness\nimplicates. Let minimal emotionalism be the view that in\norder to forgive, one must overcome a very narrow set of emotions:\nonly \u201chostile retributive feelings\u201d, attitudes whose aim\nis to see the offender suffer for what she has done (Garrard &\nMcNaughton 2002: 44). Examples of such emotions include the feelings\nof malice, spite, or ill-will that might arise as a response to being\nwronged. The minimal emotionalist can allow that there are lots of\nnegative emotions that one might experience upon being wronged (e.g.,\nanger, sadness, disappointment, hurt), but they claim that forgiveness\nrequires only that we overcome a small subset of them\u2014those\nemotions that might be best described as vengeful or hostile.\n\nAlternatively, let moderate emotionalism be the view that in\norder to forgive, one must overcome both hostile retributive\nfeelings and what we may call moral anger. According to\nmoderate emotionalism, overcoming hostile feelings is not enough for\nforgiveness. One may harbor moral anger towards a wrongdoer (so the\nview goes) without thereby wishing that she suffers for what she did.\nBut both moral anger and hostile feelings must be given up in\norder to forgive. Paul Hughes defends something like moderate\nemotionalism. An attitude counts as moral anger according to Hughes if\nit is \u201cpartially constituted by the belief that you have been\nwrongfully harmed by another\u201d (1993: 331). As Hughes notes, not\nall anger is moral; if you are angry because a bird drops a gift on\nyour head, your anger is non-moral for it is not constituted by a\nbelief that the bird has done you a wrong. But because resentment is,\naccording to Hughes, a paradigm case of moral anger, it must be\novercome in order for one to forgive. Charles Griswold also appears to\nhave in mind a kind of moderate emotionalism:\n\n\nForswearing resentment does not require giving up every\n\u2018negative\u2019 feeling associated with the injurious event\n[\u2026] Forgiveness does however mean overcoming negative feelings\nthat embody and perpetuate the key features of resentment, feelings\nthat very often accompany resentment\u2014such as contempt and\nscorn\u2014insofar as they are modulations of the moral\nhatred in question. (2007: 41)\n\n\nAlthough Griswold thinks of resentment as a kind of moral hatred, he\ndoes not think of resentment as involving a desire to inflict\nsuffering on the wrongdoer, but rather as a desire to \u201cexact a\ndue measure of punishment\u201d (2007: 26). In this respect his view\ndiffers from Garrard and McNaughton, who do target those\nemotions that involve desires to inflict suffering on the\nwrongdoer.\n\nFinally, let expansive emotionalism be the view that in order\nto forgive a wrongdoer, the victim must overcome all negative\nemotions that the victim has towards the wrongdoer on account of the\nwrongdoing in question. Norvin Richards is commonly cited as a\ndefender of what we are calling expansive emotionalism: \u201cto\nforgive someone for having wronged one is to abandon all negative\nfeelings based on the episode in question\u201d (1988: 79). On\nRichards\u2019 view, not only must one overcome emotions like malice\nand moral anger in order to forgive, one must also overcome emotions\nlike sadness and disappointment (1988: 77\u201379). In recent work,\nJeffrie Murphy has also endorsed a more expansive emotionalism.\nAlthough he once argued that forgiveness ought to be construed\nnarrowly as the overcoming of resentment, Murphy has now, citing the\ninfluence of Richards and others, become more ecumenical, writing that\nwe should \n\n\nthink of forgiveness as overcoming a variety of negative feelings that\none might have toward a wrongdoer\u2014resentment, yes, but also such\nfeelings as anger, hatred, loathing, contempt, indifference,\ndisappointment, or even sadness. (2003: 59; see also Holmgren 1993:\n341 and Blustein 2014) \n\n\nThe set of emotions that victims might possess in response to being\nwronged by another agent therefore form a large and diverse\nlandscape.\n\nEmotion theorists claim that in order to forgive one must make certain\nalterations to one\u2019s emotional life. But what kind of changes\nmust occur? Writers on forgiveness often speak of the\novercoming of resentment. In doing so we follow precedent\n(e.g., Murphy 2003: 16; Holmgren 1993: 341). But other writers have\nclaimed that one is to \u201cabandon\u201d (Richards 1988: 184) or\n\u201cforbear or withdraw\u201d (Darwall 2006: 72) resentment. Still\nothers claim that forgiveness involves \u201cletting go\u201d of\n(Griswold 2007: 40) or the \u201celimination of\u201d (Lauritzen\n1987: 142) resentment. Rarely is much more said about the machinery of\nthese proposed changes to one\u2019s emotional life (notable\nexceptions include Hughes 1993, Hieronymi 2001, and Blustein 2014). We\ntherefore want to know what kinds of changes are at issue with respect\nto each of these claims, and what relations hold between them? Does,\nfor example, overcoming resentment entail that one has totally\neliminated it? There are at least two facts about the relevant notion\nof overcoming about which most emotion theorists seem to agree.\n\nFirst, emotion theorists have been keen to clarify that it is not just\nany kind of elimination of resentment that is at issue. Were\nyou accidentally to fall and hit your head on a rock, thereby causing\nyour resentment to be eliminated, you would not have forgiven. Or if\nyour resentment simply withered away over the years via a process\noutside of your control or ken, it is widely thought that you would\nnot have forgiven (cf. Horsbrugh 1974: 271). Emotion theorists\ntherefore usually require that the forgiver\u2019s resentment be\novercome for reasons (e.g., Murphy 2001: 561). What kinds of\nreasons? Sometimes the right kinds of reasons are claimed to be\nspecifically moral reasons (Murphy 2003: 16; Griswold 2007:\n40). Murphy suggests that the fact that the wrongdoer \u201crepented\nor had a change of heart\u201d, \u201cmeant well (his motives were\ngood)\u201d, or \u201che has suffered enough\u201d are the right\nkinds of reasons (1988: 24). But here, we should be careful to\ndistinguish between two different questions. One question is a\nconceptual one, concerning what kinds of motivating reasons make\nforgiveness possible at all. But another kind of question, a\nnormative one, concerns what motivating reasons make forgiveness, on\nany given occasion, appropriate (or permissible or\npraiseworthy). If Murphy is right, then it appears that one cannot\nforgive because one wanted to win a bet. This raises questions as to\nhow moralized our conception of forgiveness ought to be. Should our\naccount of forgiveness require that in order to forgive, one must do\nso for (only) moral reasons? Or could one forgive for merely\nprudential reasons (Ingram 2013)? We will return to this issue\nbelow.\n\nSecond, it is widely thought that the kind of overcoming of resentment\nthat is implicated in forgiveness involves what Marilyn McCord Adams\ndescribes as \u201cagent effort\u201d (1991: 284). Even when one\neliminates resentment for (the right) reasons, it is possible to do so\nusing the wrong kind of process. Forgiveness therefore must\nhave the right kind of history. Suppose, for example, that one sought\nto forgive and that the miracle of modern medicine produced a pill\nthat, if ingested, could immediately eliminate one\u2019s resentment.\nIt has seemed to many that taking the resentment-eliminating pill does\nnot qualify as forgiving (even if one were to take the pill for the\nright kinds of reasons). Why? It\u2019s hard to say exactly, but many\nphilosophers think of forgiveness as a manifestation of a virtue, a\ndisposition to act and feel in certain ways (Roberts 1995; Pettigrove\n2012). On this view, forgiving acts are properly understood as being\nthe kinds of things that must \u201cgo through\u201d the agent in a\ncertain sort of way, either by way of an agential\n\u201cstruggle\u201d against resentment or a decision to give up or\ndo without resentment (what is commonly described as\n\u201cforswearing\u201d).\n\nStill, many questions remain. First, which processes of overcoming the\nrelevant emotions are the right ones? Hieronymi (2001) argues that in\nparadigmatic cases, resentment is eliminated by revising a specific\njudgment that rationally supports it, namely the judgment that the\nwrongdoer\u2019s past action stands as a present threat. For\ndiscussions of this judgment-based approach to how forgiveness\novercomes resentment see Zaragoza (2012), Nelkin (2013), and Warmke\n(2015). Blustein (2014) argues that overcoming the relevant emotions\nshould be understood as involving a certain kind of forgetting.\n\nSecond: need the relevant emotions be eliminated completely or perhaps\nonly moderated, and what are we to say if the relevant emotions return\n(perhaps unbidden, perhaps not) at some point in the future? One\nmight, for example, hold that a forgiver must eliminate all traces of\nthe relevant negative emotion(s). It is uncommon to find this view\nstated explicitly, but Haber has attributed to it to some philosophers\n(1991: 7). Others have claimed that what is needed is not the total\nand final elimination of resentment, but rather, some sort of\nmoderation. Margaret Holmgren, for example, allows that resentment can\nreoccur:\n\n\nBy overcoming her negative feelings at the time she forgives, the\nvictim does not necessarily eliminate these feelings without a trace.\nThey may recur from time to time throughout her life. However, once\nshe has determined that forgiveness is the appropriate attitude\ntowards her offender and has overcome her negative feelings towards\nhim, it will presumably be possible for her to conquer these feelings\nagain if they do recur. Thus we can plausibly say that the victim has\nforgiven her offender when she first overcomes her resentment towards\nhim. (1993: 341\u20132)\n\n\nThere is also a strand of discussion in the forgiveness literature\nthat crucially implicates the forswearing of resentment (or\nsome other attitude or behavior). P.F. Strawson claims:\n\n\n[T]o ask to be forgiven is in part to acknowledge that the attitude\ndisplayed in our actions was such as might properly be resented and in\npart to repudiate that attitude for the future (or at least for the\nimmediate future); and to forgive is to accept the repudiation and to\nforswear the resentment. (1962: 76)\n\n\nThe difference between overcoming and forswearing (or renouncing) some\nattitude is not usually made explicit. Sometimes the terms appear to\nbe used interchangeably. Marilyn McCord Adams, however, distinguishes\novercoming an attitude (which she suggests involves\n\u201cagent effort\u201d) from forswearing an attitude,\nwhich she describes as a \u201cdeliberate act\u201d (1991: 284). The\nimplication is that forswearing (as an act of renunciation) is\nsomething one does straightaway, whereas overcoming is not. One may\nforswear resentment by making a decision or making a commitment, but\nto decide to give up or commit to eliminate resentment does not imply\nthat one has or will overcome it.\n5.2 Butlerian Accounts\n\nBishop Joseph Butler is commonly cited as the progenitor of emotion\naccounts. In a way, this is not surprising, for his legacy in the\nphilosophical literature on forgiveness rests on two of his\nFifteen Sermons (1726): Sermon VIII (\u201cUpon\nResentment\u201d) and Sermon IX (\u201cUpon Forgiveness of\nInjuries\u201d). Butler does indeed make clear that resentment and\nforgiveness are importantly related, and his interpreters have often\nattributed to him the view that forgiveness is the\nforswearing or overcoming of resentment (Murphy\n1988: 15; Haber 1991: 16; Holmgren 1993: 341)\n\nErnesto Garcia (2011) has called this interpretation of Butler the\n\u201cRenunciation Model\u201d, according to which Butler holds: (1)\nthat resentment is a \u201cnegative vindictive response that is\nincompatible with goodwill\u201d; and (2) that forgiveness occurs\n\u201conly insofar as we forswear or renounce our negative feelings\nof resentment towards our wrongdoers\u201d (2011: 2). Garcia and\nothers have convincingly argued, however, that Butler did not\nadvocate the Renunciation Model, for he advocated neither of these two\ntheses (Garcia 2011; Griswold 2007: 19\u201337, and Newberry 2001).\nThis is not the place to explore Butler\u2019s view in great detail.\nHowever, we can bring into relief enough of Butler\u2019s account of\nforgiveness to show why he does not advocate the Renunciation\nModel.\n\nConsider the claim that Butler held that resentment is a response to\ninjury that is incompatible with good-will and therefore forgiveness.\nWhat Butler actually says, however, is that forgiveness is perfectly\ncompatible with an attitude of resentment. Butler held that resentment\nhelps us to deal with those who harm us: it motivates us to insulate\nourselves from wrongdoers, and it motivates us to deter future\nwrongdoing via punishment. When resentment has these ends it serves\nthe public good and is therefore compatible with the general\nobligation to good-will [IX.9]. Indeed, as Butler puts it, resentment\nis both \u201cnatural\u201d [VIII. 11] and \u201cinnocent\u201d\n[VIII.19]. Therefore, resentment as such is compatible with\ngood-will.\n\nButler does say that resentment can be dangerous, but it is not\nresentment as such that is the problem. Rather, he claims that when\nresentment is allowed to become \u201cexcessive\u201d it can easily\nlead an agent to pursue revenge, not as a means to producing some\ngreater social good, but as a self-gratifying exercise that seeks\n\u201cthe misery of our fellow creatures\u201d [IX.10]. But to let\nresentment carry one this far is to violate a general obligation to\nbenevolence. To forgive, then, is simply to prevent resentment from\nhaving this effect on us. The divine command to benevolence is\ntherefore just the command to \u201cprevent [resentment] from having\nthis effect, i.e. to forgive injuries, is the same as to love\nour enemies\u201d [IX.13.]. Resentment itself is natural and\ninnocent. It is only when it is indulged and allowed to bleed into\nrevenge that a violation of goodwill occurs. But this is the work of\nforgiveness: to prevent resentment from leading us to seek revenge.\nTherefore, Butler does not think that forgiveness is the forswearing\nor overcoming of resentment.\n\nWhat, then, is forgiveness according to Butler? Griswold\nclaims that Butler\u2019s forgiveness involves two aspects: (1) the\nforswearing of revenge; and (2) a moderation of resentment to\nan appropriate level (2007: 36). Yet according to Ernesto Garcia,\n\u201cButlerian forgiveness simply amounts to being virtuously\nresentful by avoiding both excessive and deficient resentment against\nour wrongdoers\u201d (2011: 17). On Garcia\u2019s interpretation,\nButlerian forgiveness seems to require no emotional change at\nall\u2014one can be virtuously resentful without ever having been\nviciously resentful. It is unclear whether Griswold thinks that Butler\nwould require emotional change. If all that is required is that\nresentment be kept in check, this could be done without it ever having\nbeen excessive. On the other hand, if the requirement is that one must\ngo through the process of moderating one\u2019s resentment,\nthis would require some kind emotional change (although not one that\nwould require eliminating it entirely or even trying to do so). \n5.3 Punishment-forbearance Accounts\n\nOther approaches to forgiveness claim that there is an important\nconnection between forgiving and punishment. The Oxford English\nDictionary includes \u201cpardon\u201d in its definition of\n\u2018forgive\u2019, and Hobbes drew a connection between forgiving\nand the facility to pardon in his sixth Law of Nature: \u201cA sixth\nlaw of Nature is this, \u2018that, upon caution of the future time, a\nman ought to pardon the offences past of them that, repenting, desire\nit\u2019\u201d ([1651] 1969). Remarking on this law, Bernard Gert\nwrites, \u201cThis virtue, which Hobbes calls having the facility to\npardon, one can also call being forgiving\u201d (2010: 98). In a\nsimilar vein, Leo Zaibert has recently argued that \u201cforgiveness\nis deliberately to refuse to punish\u201d (2009: 368). According to\nthe psychologist Robert Enright and his colleagues, forgiveness\ninvolves \u201cthe casting off of deserved punishments\u201d\n(Enright et al. 1992: 88). On these punishment-forbearance\nviews of forgiveness, forgiving crucially implicates the forbearance\nof punishment. \n\nAccording to these views, when one forgives one commits not to hold a\npast wrong against someone and (so the story goes) were one to punish,\ndoing so would be to hold a past wrong against the wrongdoer.\nPunishment-forbearance accounts may come in a variety of flavors,\ndepending on how one understands the logical relations between\nforgiving and forbearing punishment (see, e.g., Londey 1986:\n4\u20135; Wolsterstorff 2009: 203; Bash 2015: 53; Russell 2016). One\ncould hold that forbearing punishing is necessary for forgiveness, or\nsufficient, or both. Alternatively, one could make a\nnormative claim about the relations between forgiveness and\npunishment: forgiving a wrongdoing makes future punishment for that\nwrong morally inappropriate (see, e.g., Swinburne 1989: 97).\n\nSome reject these claims about the relationship between the\nforbearance of punishment, instead finding \u201cno clash between\npunishment and forgiveness\u201d (Mabbott 1939: 158; cf. Haber 1991,\nMurphy 2003: 101; O\u2019Shaughnessy 1967). For further discussion of\nthe relationship between punishment and forgiveness see Griswold\n(2007: 32\u201333), Pettigrove (2012: 117\u2013121), Russell (2016),\nTosi and Warmke (2017); and Warmke (2011, 2013).\n5.4 Multiple-Stage Accounts\n\nIn an insightful chapter on the relationship between forgiving and\nhatred, Jean Hampton argued that forgiveness is a two-stage process,\nthe first of which \u201cinvolves regaining one\u2019s confidence in\none\u2019s own worth despite the immoral action challenging\nit\u201d, which can be accomplished by \n\n\novercoming, in the sense of \u201cgiving up\u201d or\n\u201crepudiating\u201d, emotions such as spite and malice, and\n\u201covercoming\u201d in the sense of \u201ctranscending\u201d\nresentment. (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83) \n\n\nA further stage is required, however, for even after the first stage,\none might still hate the wrongdoer and hatred, according to Hampton,\nis incompatible with forgiveness. Therefore, at the second stage, the\nforgiver \u201creapproves\u201d of the wrongdoer (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83),\ndeciding to see the \u201cwrongdoer in a new, more favorable\nlight\u201d (84), \u201crevising her judgement of the person\nhimself\u201d (85).\n\nThis does not mean that the forgiver comes to approve of the\nwrongdoer\u2019s action or the character trait that precipitated\nit\u2014that disapproval must remain in order for forgiveness not to\ncollapse into condonation. Rather, by having a change of heart towards\nthe wrongdoer himself, the forgiver frees herself from hatred and\nindignation, allowing herself to accept the wrongdoer as a decent\nperson worthy of \u201crenewed association\u201d (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 83, 85). On\nHampton\u2019s account then, forgiveness requires both a change in\nemotion towards the wrongdoer, and an intentional alteration of\none\u2019s assessments about the wrongdoer as a person, which is why\nshe holds that \u201cforgiveness must be defined so that it involves\nmore than simply effecting certain psychological changes for moral\nreasons\u201d (1988: 37). Forgiving, therefore, is accomplished when\none successfully goes through both stages. For more on Hampton\u2019s\naccount see Radzik (2011).\n5.5 Performative Accounts\n\nThe views of forgiveness canvassed thus far have, by and large,\nfocused on forgiveness as a private phenomenon, involving, for\nexample, a change in emotion. But another strand of thinking attends\nto our social and linguistic practices related to forgiveness, most\nnotably, our practice of saying \u201cI forgive you\u201d or some\ncognate expression. Joram Haber argued that the question \u201cWhat\nis forgiveness?\u201d is best answered, \u201cin the context of what\nspeakers mean when they employ the term\u201d (1991: 53), even if\nthere are other ways to forgive besides uttering \u201c\u2018I\nforgive you\u2019\u201d (1991: 40). According to Haber,\nunderstanding forgiveness requires discovering what one does when one\nperforms the linguistic act of expressing forgiveness, typically by\nway of the utterance, \u201cI forgive you\u201d (1991: 29).\n\nTo see what Haber and his followers have in mind, we need a bit of\nbackground. J.L. Austin (1975) called attention to two ways to\nunderstand what we do when we speak. In the first instance, we can\nthink of an utterance simply as a locutionary act, which is\nsimply the act of uttering a sentence with a certain sense and\nreference. But we do not typically utter sentences simply for the sake\nof uttering sentences. We also ask questions, make demands, warn of\nthreats, persuade detractors, express our preferences, inter\nalia. Austin suggested that in addition to the performance of the\nact of uttering a sentence, we may also perform an act\nin uttering a sentence, what he called illocutionary\nacts. Consider the sentence \u201cI would like a ham\nsandwich\u201d. The locutionary act is the utterance of the sentence\nitself. The illocutionary act might be one of simply communicating a\ndesire, or it might be one of (in a different context) ordering a\nsandwich at the deli counter.\n\nOne way to examine what a speaker does when one says \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d is therefore to ask what illocutionary acts one performs\nwhen one does so. Haber focuses on a class of illocutionary acts that\nAustin called behabitives, \n\n\nwhich include the notion of reaction to other people\u2019s behavior\nand fortunes and of attitudes and expressions of attitudes to someone\nelse\u2019s past conduct or imminent conduct. (Austin 1975: 160) \n\n\nExamples of locutions with behabitive force include statements like,\n\u201cI applaud you\u201d and \u201cI commend you\u201d, which\nserve to express or exhibit the speaker\u2019s attitude about the\nconduct of the intended audience. Understood as a behabitive, \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d functions as an illocutionary act that communicates\nto the audience that the speaker possesses certain attitudes about\nher. Haber suggests that for S to say \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d to X regarding some act A of\nX\u2019s, S represents (among other things) that\n(S) has overcome his resentment for X\u2019s doing\nA, or is at least willing to try to overcome it (1991: 40).\nBuilding on Haber\u2019s account, Glen Pettigrove argues that when a\nspeaker says \u201cI forgive you\u201d, she reveals three facts\nabout herself: (1) that the speaker believes that she has been wronged\nby the one to whom she speaks; (2) that the speaker has an absence of\nhostile reactive attitudes that might have arisen in response to the\nwrongdoing; and (3) that the speaker has some degree of positive\nregard for the one she addresses (2004a: 379).\n\nSpeech acts may also function as commissives, which have the\nillocutionary force of committing the speaker to an action or a course\nof conduct. One might say, \u201cI promise to buy you a tangerine\ntomorrow\u201d, or \u201cI will never lie to you again\u201d. In\ndoing so, the speaker places herself under an obligation to do (or not\ndo) what she says she will do (or not do). Pettigrove claims that in\naddition to functioning as a behabitive, \u201cI forgive you\u201d\ncan also function as a commissive by committing the speaking to\nforswear hostile reactive attitudes and retaliation toward the\nwrongdoer and to treat her with an appropriate level of benevolence\n(2004a: 385).\n\nUsed as a declarative, utterances or expressions may have the\neffect of (to put it crudely) changing reality in various ways. An\nappropriate authority might, for example, say, \u201cI christen this\nship\u201d, or \u201cI hereby find you guilty\u201d. By making such\nan utterance, one is actually able to make it so that a ship\nis christened or that one is found guilty. Understood as a\ndeclarative, the utterance \u201cI forgive you\u201d (or one of its\ncognates) makes it the case that one has been forgiven, thereby\naltering the operative norms governing the interaction between victim\nand wrongdoer (Warmke 2016a, 2016b). Much like one can declare a debt\nforgiven (or a criminal pardoned), one can declare that one has been\nforgiven by sincerely saying something like \u201cI forgive\nyou\u201d (Swinburne 1989). Such a declaration could release a\nwrongdoer from certain kinds of personal obligations to the victim\n(such as further apology or restitution, remorse or penance) (Nelkin\n2013). It might also function as a way for the victim to relinquish\ncertain rights or permissions to continue blaming the wrongdoer\n(Warmke 2016b).\n\nThree clarifications about performative accounts are in order. First,\none need not think that performative forgiveness possesses only one\nkind of illocutionary force. Pettigrove (2004a, 2012), for example,\nargues that \u201cI forgive you\u201d can function as both a\nbehabitive and commissive. Some hold that it can function as a\nbehabitive, commissive, and declarative (Warmke 2016b). Second,\ndefenders of performative accounts need not hold that acts of\nforgiveness qua performative, must always function in the\nsame way, for it might be that even if \u201cthe language of\nforgiveness is quite often put to a performatory use, and it is not\nalways put to the same performatory use\u201d (Neblett 1974: 269; cf.\nPettigrove 2012: 17\u20138). It may be that sometimes \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d functions only as a behabitive, and other times\nalso as a commissive. Third, defenders of performative accounts need\nnot think that only speech acts (e.g., utterances of \u201cI\nforgive you\u201d) can fulfill the performative functions of\nforgiving. Cognate communicative acts, gestures, and facial\nexpressions may achieve the same result (Swinburne 1989: 85).\n5.6 Pluralist Accounts\n\nSome philosophers have argued that forgiveness is just too diverse and\ndiffuse of a practice to be captured by a simple, singular theory.\nNick Smith observes that our \u201cnotions of forgiveness seem to\nidentify a loose constellation of interrelated meanings among various\nbeliefs, judgments, emotions and actions\u201d (2008: 134).\nResponding to the view that forgiveness is the same wherever it\noccurs, William Neblett writes that \n\n\nif there is anything about forgiveness that is always the same, no\nmatter the context, it is very little, and it is none of the various\nthings that philosophers are prone to say that it is, that it must be\n(like the wiping away of all resentment and ill-will). (1974: 273, cf.\n269)\n\n\nMarilyn McCord Adams has suggested that forgiveness has two\n\u201cmodalities\u201d, which she labels \u201cperformative\nforgiveness\u201d and \u201cforgiveness from the heart\u201d (1991:\n294). Forgiveness from the heart, she writes, \u201cinvolves a\nprocess of letting go of one\u2019s own point of view\n(regarding the situation, one\u2019s self and/or the victim, and the\noffender)\u201d, which will typically \u201cinvolve many changes in\nfeelings, attitudes, judgments and desires\u201d (1991: 294\u20135,\nitalics original). Performative forgiveness, on the other hand,\n\u201cfocuses on externals (material compensations or behavior) and\nthe formal structures of relationships, not on inner attitudes or\nfeelings\u201d (1991: 294). Examples include \u201cthe public\nacceptance of apologies for small injuries\u201d and cases in which a\n\u201ccivil suit could be pressed but is legally or officially\nwaived\u201d, either of which, she claims, may be accomplished absent\nany \u201ccommitment to change one\u2019s attitudes or\nfeelings\u201d (1991: 294). The key thought to which Adams draws our\nattention is that the phenomena counting as forgiveness can be\nunderstood as possessing an interior dimension or an\nexterior dimension (and sometimes both) (cf. Zaibert 2009;\nWarmke & McKenna 2013). Adams\u2019s forgiveness from the heart\noccurs in this interior dimension insofar as it involves those things\nthat can be roughly described as psychological: judgments, beliefs,\nemotions, feelings, decisions and intentions are interior aspects of\nforgiveness. The exterior \u201cperformative\u201d dimension\ninvolves those things that can be roughly described as bodily. The\nrelevant kinds of bodily conduct might include things like utterances\nof \u201cI forgive you\u201d, gestures, friendly behaviors, or a\nwritten letter or email.\n6. Self-forgiveness\n\nIn the recent years, the topic of self-forgiveness has drawn\nconsiderable attention (see, e.g., Williston 2012; Milam 2015).\nIndeed, it does seem a commonplace that people claim to forgive\nthemselves both for wrongs they commit against others, and for\nself-directed wrongs in the form of some sort of personal failure or\nshortcoming, such as violating a commitment to another person; or\nfailing to adhere to a diet. Although there seems to be no logical\nreason to think self-forgiveness as overcoming various forms of\nself-directed moral reactive attitudes such as disappointment or\ndisgust is fundamentally unlike interpersonal forgiveness, there are\nsignificant differences between the two. First, and notwithstanding\nthe fact that people may be angry with themselves, experience\nself-directed loathing, and struggle to overcome such negative\nemotional attitudes, it is not clear that the idea of resenting\noneself is coherent and, thus, whether forgiveness as overcoming\nself-referential resentment is possible, at least on certain accounts\nof forgiveness. This is because resentment in the sense at issue\nrequires such cognitions as that the wrongdoer is a moral agent and\nthe victim a moral subject whose rights are in some way violated by a\nwrongdoer. That one and the same person is involved simultaneously as\nagent and subject, wrongdoer and victim, in this drama is often\nthought incompatible with the idea that resentment is necessarily\ndirected at other people (Arendt 1958).\n\nNancy Snow (1992) argues that self-forgiveness serves two important\nself-regarding purposes (though see Hughes 1994). First, it serves the\npurpose of restoring wrongdoers to full moral agency even in the\nabsence of the victim\u2019s forgiveness. This is similar to\nHolmgren\u2019s claim (1998) that self-forgiving is a way of\nrestoring or maintaining one\u2019s intrinsic self-worth, which she\nargues is an extension of her analysis of interpersonal forgiveness.\nZenon Szablowinski (2011) concurs, arguing that a failure to\nself-forgive may be detrimental to a wrongdoer\u2019s moral and\npsychological well-being, and that such forgiveness is morally\nappropriate when a wrongdoer\u2019s guilt, shame, or self-loathing\nreach significantly high levels. Second, it constitutes a second-best\nalternative to full interpersonal forgiveness, in the sense that when\nfull interpersonal forgiveness is not forthcoming (and there can be\nmany reasons for this), self-forgiving is nevertheless an important\nand sometimes morally appropriate response to having done wrong.\n7. Divine Forgiveness\n\nThe topic of God\u2019s relation to human wrongdoing is an important\none in mainstream Western theological and philosophical discussions of\nforgiveness, but it is by no means clear what the relationship is\nsupposed to be between God and forgiveness, and the connection between\nthat and the possibility of forgiveness between persons. This is\nbecause there is some question whether the differences between divine\nand human forgiveness are so significant that any comparison between\nthem is inapt. As one author puts the point, \n\n\nThe difference between the human and the divine should not be\nunderestimated, and it is possible that it would not just be over\noptimistic but actually dangerous to expect people to model their\nbehavior on God. (Tombs 2008: 592) \n\n\nThe concern expressed in this remark is that whereas God\u2019s\nforgiveness is supposedly unilateral, unilateral human forgiveness may\nbe irresponsible, as when a victim of wrongdoing forgives a wrongdoer\nirrespective of any signs of repentance on the part of the wrongdoer.\nAnother writer argues that the gap between human and divine\nforgiveness is unbridgeable, for God\u2019s forgiveness is grounded\nin \u201ceschatological divine justice\u201d not, as in human\nforgiveness, in an awareness of \u201csinful solidarity with\nhumanity\u201d (Williams 2008: 584\u2013585).\n\nIf divine forgiveness is possible, what is its nature? Douglas Drabkin\nreports that \u201cthere is no other way that God can forgive us, as\nfar as I can see, except through a change in emotion\u201d (1993:\n237). What kind of emotional changes might be at issue? For many, the\nobvious candidate will be resentment. And so on this view, when we do\nwrong, God has resentment towards us. To follow Jonathan Edwards, we\nare \u201csinners in the hands of an angry God\u201d. God forgives\nus by eliminating that resentment (though see Minas 1975).\n\nOne need not think that God gives up resentment, however, to adopt an\nemotion theory of divine forgiveness. Douglas Drabkin has argued that\nthere is a kind of emotional change that is natural to suppose that\nGod experiences and that this change is a good candidate for divine\nforgiveness. On his view, God, like any loving parent, will\n\u201csuffer on our account\u201d when we do evil (235). \u201cWhen\nwe repent\u201d, he says, \u201cGod feels our joy and ceases to\nsuffer\u201d (235). He concludes: \u201cThis, I am suggesting, is\nhow God forgives us: by rejoicing in our repentance\u201d (235).\nHowever, on those theological views according to which God is\nimpassible (i.e., God is unable to suffer or have reactive emotions),\nthese kinds of emotion views will be off the table (see, e.g.,\nGavrilyuk 2004).\n\nAnother approach to divine forgiveness says that God forgives by\nforbearing punishment. Some philosophical discussions of divine\nforgiveness have proceeded as if this view (or something very much\nlike it) is the default position. For example, David Londey proceeds\nto answer this question by operating with a conception of forgiveness\nthat crucially involves the remission of any \u201cpenalty or\nsanction\u201d, including \u201cmoral censure\u201d and \u201cmore\ntangible punishments\u201d that a wrongdoer is due (1986: 5). In\ntheir respective replies to Londey defending the possibility of divine\nforgiveness, Andrew Brien and Dean Geuras each assume a\npunishment-forbearance view according to which forgiveness is the\nforbearing of any punishment one ought to inflict (Brien 1989: 35) and\nthe remission of a deserved penalty (Geuras 1992: 65). Swinburne\nargues that God\u2019s forgiveness is akin to the forgiveness of a\nkind of debt: when God forgives us, the guilt that our wrongdoing\nincurred is wiped away (1989). See also Bash (2015), Brien (1989),\nMackintosh (1927), Minas (1975), and Scheiber (2001).\n8. Political Forgiveness\n\nThe power of pardon enjoyed by duly established political authorities\nmay be at best a loose cognate of forgiveness, but this is not to say\nthat all legal or political analogues to forgiveness are implausible\n(for discussion see MacLachlan 2012, cf. Norlock & Veltman 2009). P.E. Digeser (2001) has argued\nin favor of a conception of political forgiveness that breaks sharply\nwith the standard philosophical accounts of forgiveness as involving\nthe overcoming of resentment or other negative emotional states by\nvictims of wrong. Instead, Digeser seeks to divest political\nforgiveness of any personal feelings whatsoever in favor of a\nperformative account in which such overt behaviors as pardoning a\ncriminal or waiving a debt signify forgiveness. Digeser claims that\nseparating the action of forgiving from its underlying motive and from\nthe constellation of feelings often thought to accompany interpersonal\nforgiveness better suits a conception of justice as one in which\npeople get their due. On this performative conception, forgiveness\nconsists in political actors or institutions opting not to get their\ndue, for whatever reasons.\n\nDigeser claims to have created a serviceable political notion of\nforgiveness shorn of its usual psychological baggage. And surely, as\nnoted earlier, there is a sense of forgiveness in which an action such\nas waiving a debt or an utterance such as \u201cI forgive you\u201d\nis sometimes all that forgiveness is about. To this extent and in this\nsense, debt forgiveness and political pardons may reasonably be\nregarded as political forms of forgiving, and Digeser identifies four\nforms such political forgiveness may take (2001: 9). First, political\nforgiveness takes a many-to-one form when a group forgives an\nindividual. Suppose, for example, the American people could forgive\nformer President Clinton for lying to a grand jury, or that a\nuniversity community could forgive a dean who embezzled funds. Second,\nwe can recognize one-to-many political forgiveness, whereby\nan individual forgives a group. One can imagine, for example,\nexonerated prisoners forgiving police forces or the justice system for\nwrongly arresting or convicting them (for even if no single member of\nthe police or justice system wronged the exonerated prisoner, their\njoint action may have done so). Third, in many-to-many\npolitical forgiveness, groups or collectives enter into forgiveness\nrelations with other groups or collectives. Examples may include the\naforementioned cases of U.S.-Japan and Tutsi-Hutu relations. Finally,\none-to-one political forgiveness involves individuals\nforgiving other individuals. President Gerald Ford, for example,\nfamously issued an executive pardon to former President Richard Nixon\nafter his resignation amidst charges that he broke the law.\n\nThe past thirty or so years have seen a rapid increase on the part of\npolitical leaders apologizing for and seeking reconciliation between\nperpetrators and victims of moral atrocities. The ostensible aim of\nsuch efforts has not only been to rectify past wrongs and give those\nwho have been wronged their due, but to heal deep and sometimes\nlongstanding wounds caused by such wrongs as well. The South African\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in the mid 1990s is probably\nthe best-known example of such attempts to achieve reconciliation\nbetween perpetrators and victims of intra-national collective wrongs\n(Tutu 1999). Other instances of political apology, aimed in part at\neffecting some form of forgiveness or reconciliation, include\nAustralia\u2019s \u201csorry book\u201d, which records\ncitizens\u2019 remorse over a former government policy mandating the\nforced removal of aboriginal children from their natural parents in\nthe name of cultural assimilation, President Clinton\u2019s apology\nto African Americans and subsequent proposals by scholars and\npolicy-makers of reparations for slavery, and Northern Ireland\u2019s\n1998 Good Friday Agreement and the peace process initiated thereby\n(Brooks 2004; Biggar 2008). Understanding forgiveness as roughly\nsynonymous with reconciliation supports the notion that these\ncollective endeavors are institutional forms of forgiveness (Radzik\n2009).\n9. The Ethics of Forgiveness\n9.1 Forgiveness as a Virtue\n\nWithin Western traditions, forgiveness has often been regarded as a\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d virtue (Scarre 2004), and its\nopposite, unwillingness to forgive, as a vice. Yet this poses an\nimmediate problem of interpretation, namely, whether forgiveness is a\n\u201chigh\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d virtue in the sense\nthat while it is morally laudable it is beyond duty (i.e.,\nsupererogatory). Since supererogatory actions are permissible, not\nobligatory, it follows that a failure to forgive, at least in\ncircumstances where forgiving would be supererogatory, would not,\ncontrary to the aforementioned view, be a vice. However, widespread\nand persistent disagreement within moral philosophy both about\nsupererogation and the deontic nature of forgiveness have led to\nconflicting views on the relation between forgiveness and moral\nobligation (see, e.g., Gamlund 2010; Lauritzen 1987). Some thinkers\nhave argued that forgiveness is a duty (Rashdall 1907) while others\nhave maintained that, like a gift with no strings attached,\nforgiveness is utterly gratuitous (Heyd 1982). It might also be\nthought that, similar to the duty of charity in Kant\u2019s moral\nsystem, forgiveness is properly regarded as an imperfect duty. Unlike\nperfect duties such as the obligation to justice or honesty, imperfect\nduties allow for agential discretion over when and with respect to\nwhom to discharge the duty. In this way, forgiveness may be located in\na system of moral duties that allows for no supererogatory deeds at\nall.\n\nIn contrast to duty-based approaches to forgiveness, virtue-based\nperspectives suggest that the overcoming or forswearing of angry\nreactive attitudes characteristic of forgiveness must be grounded in\nor expressive of relatively stable and durable dispositions or\ncharacter traits (Roberts 1995; Sadler 2008; Radzik 2010). On such\nviews, forgiveness is a virtue, or is at least closely aligned with\none or more of the traditional virtues such as magnanimity or\nsympathy. Within ancient Greek thought the views of Plato and\nAristotle on the relationship between anger and living virtuously are\nnoteworthy, as is the Christian traditions\u2019 understanding of\nforgiveness as love or compassion.\n\nAlthough forgiveness is not identified as a distinct virtue in\nPlato\u2019s work, the Platonic perspective on anger illuminates the\ngeneral emotional landscape in which forgiveness has often been\nlocated and from which it derives much of its value. In his discussion\non the nature of community and individual morality in Book IV of the\nRepublic, Plato makes clear that demonstrations of anger are\ngenerally regarded as manifestations of intemperance, which is a vice,\nand since angry emotions are ever a threat to overwhelm reason and\nself-control they must be rationally controlled in the name of a\nharmonious ordering of the different parts of the soul, which is the\nessence of a morally good person (Republic, 439\u2013442).\nBy contrast, Aristotle, in his discussion of virtues and vices\nrelative to anger in Book IV of the Nicomachean Ethics,\nexplains that \u201cgood temper\u201d is the mean between the\nextremes of irascibility, an excess of anger, and inirascibility, or\nwhat he alternatively calls a \u201cnameless\u201d deficiency of\nanger, and that the good-tempered person \u201cis not revengeful, but\nrather tends to forgive\u201d (1126a1). Aristotle\u2019s general\nperspective on morally appropriate anger is that the person of virtue\nis \u201cangry at the right things and with the right people, and,\nfurther, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought\u201d\n(1125b32). In general, both Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s views\nsuggest that anger controlled by or expressive of reason may be seen\nas manifesting virtue, whereas anger ungoverned by rationality is a\nvice.\n\nA disposition to too readily forgive may be symptomatic of a lack of\nself-respect, or indicative of servility, ordinarily viewed as moral\ninfirmities or vices (Novitz 1998). This recalls Aristotle\u2019s\nidea that the person deficient in appropriate anger is \u201cunlikely\nto defend himself\u201d and \u201cendure being insulted\u201d and\nis for this reason a \u201cfool\u201d (Nicomachean Ethics,\n1126a5), Kant\u2019s notion that a person who fails to become angry\nat injustices done to him lacks dignity and self-respect (Kant [c.\n1770\u20131794] 1997, cf. Sussman 2005; Ware 2014), and Hume\u2019s\nassertion that since anger and hatred are \u201cinherent in our very\nframe and constitution\u201d the lack of such feelings is sometimes\nevidence of \u201cweakness and imbecility\u201d ([1740] 1958: 605).\nThat interpersonal forgiveness does not always serve morally laudable\naims suggests that a general account of the criteria for justified and\nmorally permissible or even obligatory forgiveness is needed to\ndistinguish appropriate from inappropriate forgiving.\n\nSeveral virtue-theoretic perspectives contrary both to early Greek\nnotions that anger appropriately mediated by reason is a virtue, and\nfrom the Christian view that forgiveness as transcending anger in an\nact of love is a virtue, should be mentioned. First, Nietzsche\u2019s\nconception of ressentiment as sublimated anger/envy directed\nat the noble man suggests that both dispositional and episodic anger\nmay be manifestations of weakness or vice, not strength, self-respect,\nor virtue (Nietzsche [1887] 1967; cf. Griswold 2007; Blustein 2014).\nThis is reminiscent of Plutarch\u2019s view that anger is like a\ndisease, and extreme or abiding anger such as rage or bitterness are\nunnatural dispositional states (Plutarch [c. 100 CE] 2000). We should\nadd to these views the observation that the negative effects of being\nangrily obsessed by someone\u2019s wrongdoing is not by itself a\njustification for blaming or forgiving him. Put differently, though it\nmight be a bad thing to be angrily obsessed with having been wronged,\nit does not follow from this that a victim of wrong must forgive the\nwrongdoer. There are, after all, other ways of transcending or purging\nrecalcitrant anger which might be more appropriate than would be\nforgiving. \n\nNietzsche\u2019s view suggests the further idea that even episodic\nangry emotions may be a sign of moral infirmity, insofar as such\nemotions concede power to others by revealing one\u2019s\nvulnerability to injury. But the truly noble or strong are thought to\nhave, in some sense, no such vulnerabilities. Second, some recent\npopular views suggest that the uninhibited expression of anger and\nrage is a good thing, insofar as such venting is cathartic. But on\nconsequentialist grounds alone it seems clear that controlling intense\nanger rather than its unfettered expression is closer to what a good\nlife requires, for though anger may sometimes be enabling in\nmotivating constructive solutions to personal or political problems,\nits indiscriminate expression is more likely to be disabling, both for\nthose expressing it and for those around them. This last remark\nrelates to a third disparaging view of angry reactive attitudes, that\nof the Stoic Seneca, who maintains that all forms of anger are\ninconsistent with the moral life because they dispose us to cruelty\nand vengeance, which passions encourage us to see other people as less\nthan fully human (De Ira, c. 50CE). On this view, the person\nof virtue is one who strives to extirpate anger in all its forms.\nThese three perspectives seem to imply that since anger is never an\nappropriate emotion, forgiveness cannot be a virtue, at least in the\nsense of overcoming justified anger.\n\nWhat is the connection between forgiveness and another virtue, that of\njustice? Forgiveness has long been regarded by some as in conflict\nwith justice, if not incompatible with it. Seneca (De\nClementia, c. 55CE) claimed that \n\n\nPardon is given to a man who ought to be punished; but a wise man does\nnothing that he ought not to do, omits to do nothing which he ought \nto do; therefore he does not remit a punishment which he ought to\nexact. \n\n\nMercy, by contrast, is aligned with justice in the sense that\n\u201cit declares that those who are let off did not deserve any\ndifferent treatment\u201d (De Clementia). Considering the\nspecific circumstances of individual cases is a matter of mercy,\n\u201cnot of forgiveness\u201d. Mercy, unlike pardon and\nforgiveness, is an exercise of equity, which is an application of\njustice in light of the unique circumstances of individual cases. By\ncontrast, the prerogative of pardon associated with such political\nexecutives as Presidents, Prime Ministers, and other authorities may\nbe viewed, according to Aristotle, as an exercise of equity in the\nsense that such duly established authorities are commonly thought to\nuse that power as a way of mitigating the rigors of universal\nstandards of justice in their application to particular cases the\nspecifics of which appear to fall beyond the scope of the universal\nrule (Wolsterstorff 2009; Bingham 2009).\n9.2 Norms Governing Instances of Forgiveness\n\nWhat about the morality of individual acts of forgiveness? Let us use\n\u201cpositive moral status\u201d as an umbrella term to capture the\nstatus of an instance of forgiveness insofar as it is morally\ngood, morally virtuous, morally permissible, morally praiseworthy,\nmorally right, morally obligatory, or morally supererogatory. It is\ncommonplace to think that in order for an act of forgiveness to have\npositive moral status, certain kinds of conditions must be met.\nConditionalism is the view that in order for an act of\nforgiveness to have positive moral status, certain conditions must be\nmet either by the victim or the wrongdoer (or both). For example, it\nmight be thought that in order for forgiveness to have positive moral\nstatus, the victim must forgive for certain kinds of good reasons. If\nthe victim does not forgive for those good kinds of reasons, then she\ndoes something morally impermissible (or bad, or blameworthy, etc.) by\nforgiving. We can call such conditions victim-dependent.\nAlternatively, it might be thought that in order for forgiveness to\nhave positive moral status, the wrongdoer must, say, apologize to the\nvictim. This is a kind of wrongdoer-dependent condition. If\nthe wrongdoer does not apologize to the victim, then the victim does\nsomething morally impermissible (or bad, or blameworthy, etc.) by\nforgiving.\n\nNotice, however, that this claim is to be distinguished from the view\naccording to which, absent a wrongdoer\u2019s apology, the\nvictim\u2019s \u201cforgiveness\u201d is not actually forgiveness\nat all, but instead condonation or exculpation. On this latter sort of\nview, the conditions for positive moral status for an act of\nforgiveness are built into the very constitutive conditions for\nforgiveness itself. We can call a view of forgiveness that builds the\nconditions for positive moral status into the conditions for\nforgiveness itself a \u201cthick\u201d conception of forgiveness. On\nthis view, forgiveness is, as such, always morally good, morally\npermissible, or otherwise possesses some other such positive moral\nstatus. (This is consistent with an act of forgiveness being all\nthings considered wrong if, say, forgiving in some case would cause\nthe death of innocent millions.) In contrast, a \u201cthin\u201d\nconception of forgiveness is one that allows that an instance of\nforgiveness can lack positive moral status. Of course, both thick and\nthin conceptions of forgiveness can require (or not require) that\neither (or both) victim-dependent and wrongdoer-dependent conditions\nwere first met. And so here, we will set aside this thick/thin\ncontroversy and focus on the conditions for morally positive\nforgiveness as such.\n\nIt is widely thought that in order for an act of forgiveness to have\npositive moral status, the victim must meet certain conditions. The\nmost commonly cited kind of victim-dependent condition has to do with\nthe victim\u2019s motivating reasons for forgiving. Only some kinds\nof motivating reasons make forgiveness morally positive. For example,\nJoram Haber has argued that for an act of forgiveness to be\n\u201cappropriate\u201d (such that were we to forgive we would not\nrisk \u201cmoral reproval\u201d), the victim must forgive for a\nreason that \u201cpreserves self-respect\u201d and that the\n\u201conly reason that would serve this function is that the\nwrongdoer has repented the wrong she has done\u201d (1991: 90). For\nHaber, then, it seems that unless the wrongdoer repents and the victim\nforgives her (at least in part) for this reason, then that forgiveness\nis morally inappropriate. Haber therefore has two conditions, one\nwrongdoer-dependent (to repent for the wrong done), and one\nvictim-dependent (to forgive at least in part because the wrongdoer\nrepented). Jeffrie Murphy articulates a similar view, claiming that\n\n\n\nacceptable grounds for forgiveness must be compatible with\nself-respect, respect for others as moral agents, and respect for the\nrules of morality and the moral order. (Murphy & Hampton 1988: 24)\n\n\n\nExamples of the kinds of moral reasons that Murphy has in mind\ninclude: that the wrongdoer repented or had a change of heart, that\nshe has suffered enough, and that she has undergone humiliation, such\nas \u201cthe apology ritual\u201d (24).\n\nThere may be other kinds of conditions that a victim must meet in\norder to effect morally positive forgiveness. Charles Griswold writes\nthat in the \u201cparadigmatic scene\u201d, where forgiveness is\n\u201cat its best\u201d as the manifestation of virtue (2007: 38),\nin addition to forswearing revenge, moderating resentment, and\ncommitting to give up any lingering resentment, the victim must also:\n(1) revise her view of the wrongdoer as someone who is reducible to\nthe person who did the wrong; (2) give up any presumption of decisive\nmoral superiority and recognize the shared humanity of both parties;\nand (3) address the wrongdoer and declare that forgiveness is granted\n(2007: 54\u20138).\n\nIt is more controversial whether morally positive forgiveness requires\nwrongdoer-dependent conditions. One of the foremost defenders of such\nconditions is Charles Griswold, who argues that in the\n\u201cparadigmatic scene\u201d, there are numerous\nwrongdoer-dependent conditions on forgiveness. Namely, the wrongdoer\nmust: (1) acknowledge that she was responsible for the wrong in\nquestion; (2) repudiate the deeds and disavow the thought that she\nwould do them again; (3) experience and express regret at having\ncaused the particular wrong; (4) commit, by deeds and words, to being\nthe sort of person who doesn\u2019t do wrong; (5) show that she\nunderstands, from the victim\u2019s perspective, the damage done by\nthe wrongdoing; and (6) offer some sort of narrative to explain why\nshe did wrong (2007: 47\u201351).\n\nAs noted above, Haber claims that repentance is necessary for morally\npositive forgiveness, as does Wilson (1988). Swinburne claims that,\nleast in the case of \u201cserious hurt\u201d, \u201cit is both bad\nand ineffective\u201d to forgive when no atonement has been made\n(where atonement includes some combination of reparation, repentance,\napology, and penance) (1989: 84, 86). Although he remains\nnon-committal about the necessity of wrongdoer-dependent conditions,\nJeffrie Murphy thinks that \u201cit is not unreasonable to make\nforgiveness contingent on sincere repentance\u201d (2003: 36).\n\nWhy think that a wrongdoer must apologize, repent, or have a change of\nheart in order for forgiveness to have positive moral status? Two\ngeneral reasons have been given. First, it is thought that in the\nabsence of apology and repentance, forgiving constitutes a failure to\ntake the wrongdoing seriously enough. If we give up our resentment or\ndiscontinue blame while the wrongdoer continues to \u201cstand\nby\u201d their mistreatment of us, we are in effect condoning the\nwrongdoing (see, e.g., Kolnai 1973: 95\u20136). A second kind of\nreason is that forgiving in the absence of apology and repentance\nreveals a lack of self-respect. Forgiving the unapologetic will\nusually, if not always, mean that the victim will \u201cunderestimate\ntheir own worth and fail to take their projects and entitlements\nseriously enough\u201d (Novitz 1998: 299; cf. Murphy 1982: 505;\nGriswold 2007: 64\u20135). In reply, Pettigrove (2004b, 2012: ch. 6)\nand Garrard and McNaughton (2011) take on both the condonation and the\nself-respect arguments, concluding that neither shows that forgiving\nunrepentant or unapologetic wrongdoers necessarily puts one at moral\nrisk. For discussion of three other objections to the rejection of\nwrongdoer-dependent conditions\u2014that it has bad consequences,\nthat it is arbitrary, and that absent repentance resentment is still\nwarranted\u2014see Garrard and McNaughton (2011). \n\nEve Garrard and David McNaughton originally coined the term\n\u201cunconditional forgiveness\u201d to refer to morally positive\nforgiveness that doesn\u2019t depend on the actions or attitudes of\nthe wrongdoer (2002). The term itself may be misleading for the kind\nof conditions on morally positive forgiveness they rejected are what\nwe are calling the wrongdoer-dependent conditions: they argued that an\nact of forgiveness need not be lacking in positive moral status just\nbecause the wrongdoer did not repent, apologize, or make restitution.\nThey did not mean to claim that all acts of forgiveness as\nsuch have positive moral status, and so have recently clarified their\nposition, defending what they call \u201cconditional unconditional\nforgiveness\u201d (2011; cf. Hoffman 2009). Their view is\nunconditional insofar as morally positive forgiveness does not require\nthat the wrongdoer repent, apologize, or make restitution. However, a\nvictim\u2019s forgiveness may still be \u201cdefectively\nfacile\u201d if she fails to grasp the moral significance of the\noffense and so overcomes her hostile feelings too \u201csmoothly and\neasily\u201d (Garrard & McNaughton 2011: 105). Her reasons for\nforgiving may be bad ones and she may display her forgiveness in an\nillegitimate manner. The illegitimacy of such forgiveness, however,\nhas nothing to do with the wrongdoer\u2019s actions or state of mind.\n\n\nMargaret Holmgren articulates a similar view, arguing that once a\nvictim completes a certain kind of process, \n\n\nforgiveness is always appropriate and desirable from a moral point of\nview, regardless of whether the wrongdoer repents and regardless of\nwhat [the wrongdoer] has done or suffered. (1993: 341) \n\n\nAbsent this process, however, the victim forgives prematurely, and her\nforgiveness may therefore be incompatible with her own self-respect\nand therefore inappropriate (1993: 341, 342). Notice that for\nHolmgren, whether one\u2019s forgiveness is self-respecting depends\nwholly on whether the victim herself goes through a certain kind of\nprocess. On her view, forgiveness that is compatible with self-respect\ndoes not depend on the actions or attitudes of the wrongdoer. What\nkind of process is required? Holmgren identifies six general elements\nof this process: the victim must (1) recover her self-esteem; (2)\ncome to fully appreciate the nature of the wrongdoing and why it was\nwrong; (3) acknowledge as basic and legitimate her feelings of anger\nand grief as a result of being wronged; (4) not withhold something she\nneeds to say or express to the wrongdoer about her beliefs and\nfeelings; (5) reassess the nature of her relationship with the\nwrongdoer; and (6) determine whether she wants to seek restitution\nfrom the wrongdoer (1993: 343\u20134).\n9.3 Skepticism About the Morality of Forgiveness\n\nAll of the views canvassed thus far allow that, at least in some\ncircumstances, forgiveness has positive moral status. But some\nphilosophers have expressed skepticism about the morality of\nforgiveness as such. For example, some \u201cperfectionist\u201d\nviews of morality might see forgiveness, not as having intrinsic moral\nvalue, but as having only instrumental or remedial value. A\nperfectionist view might hold that whatever attitudes or actions we\novercome or forbear in forgiveness were not morally good in the first\nplace: to feel resentment, for example, admits of moral error. And so\nif one is in a position to forgive, this would reveal only that\nsomething morally sub-par had already occurred in how a victim\nresponded to being wronged. Forgiveness might be thought then as just\nthe mechanism by which we expunge those already morally mistaken\nreactions. Griswold argues that something like this perfectionist\nscheme can be found in the ancients from Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics,\nand the Epicureans (2007: 2\u201314). And though his views on what we\nnow call forgiveness are complicated, Nietzsche might be understood as\n\u201cseeing forgiveness as part of a moral system that must be\nrejected in toto\u201d (Griswold 2007: 15; cf. Blustein\n2014: 23\u201330).\n\nModern-day skeptics about moral responsibility and blameworthiness\nmight also be committed to a remedial view of the moral status of\nforgiveness (see, e.g., Pereboom 2014). If no one is morally\nresponsible and blameworthy for what they do, then morally reactive\nattitudes like resentment will likely be inappropriate for both\nepistemic and moral reasons. But if forgiving requires that one hold a\nwrongdoer morally responsible and blameworthy for what they have done,\nthey are making a kind of moral mistake. Forgiving\u2014understood as\ngiving up one\u2019s morally reactive attitudes or blaming\nbehaviors\u2014might be what is required to reverse that mistake, but\nthe need to forgive itself is evidence that something has already gone\nwrong as regards one\u2019s reactions to being wronged. According to\nMartha Nussbaum (2016), another modern critic of forgiveness, not only\ndoes forgiveness respond to an already normatively problematic\nattitude (i.e., resentment), it also takes on in its\n\u201ctransactional\u201d form a kind of morally suspect\ndown-ranking: the victim demands apology and humility from the\nwrongdoer thereby bringing her low until the victim is ready to move\non from her anger.\n\nOne contemporary critic of the positive moral status of forgiveness is\nJohn Kekes (2009), who argues that the \u201cstandard view\u201d\n(viz. that forgiveness is always or at least sometimes\nmorally good) is \u201cseriously flawed\u201d. The reason is simple:\n\u201cwhen blaming wrongdoers is reasonable, there is no reason to\nforgive them; and when blaming them is unreasonable, there is nothing\nto forgive\u201d (2009: 488; cf. Kolnai 1973; Zaibert 2009; Hallich\n2013). On Kekes\u2019 view, whether blame is reasonable depends on\n(1) whether the blamer\u2019s belief about having suffered\nundeserved, unjustified, and non-trivial harm is true; (2) whether the\nemotion such harm elicits is appropriate; (3) whether the motive (for\nblaming) is commensurate with the harm; and (4) whether the (blaming)\naction, if there is one, remains within the limits set by the\nblamer\u2019s relevant belief, emotion, judgment, and motive (2009:\n501). And so if someone has done nothing blameworthy, then\n\u201cneither blame nor forgiveness is appropriate\u201d (2009:\n501). On the other hand, if someone has done something blameworthy,\nthen \u201cblame [of the right kind and degree] is appropriate and\nforgiveness is not\u201d (2009: 501). Either way, to forgive would be\nto do something morally inappropriate.\n\nKekes\u2019 argument relies on at least two crucial assumptions.\nFirst, it assumes that forgiveness requires giving up the judgment\nthat one has been the victim of undeserved, unjustified and\nnon-trivial harm, a judgment that is \u201cat the core of\nblame\u201d (2009: 498, contrast Pettigrove 2012: 6\u20137, fn. 12).\nIf an account of forgiveness had no such requirement, however, then\nforgiveness would not be inappropriate simply because it required one\nto adopt a false belief about the past. Second, the argument assumes\nthat when a wrongdoer is blameworthy, then either blame or forgiveness\nis appropriate, but not both. Yet if one can forgive while still\njudging truly that the wrongdoer did wrong, then it may be appropriate\neither to continue to blame or to instead forgive.\nBlameworthiness may provide reasons that merely justify\nblame, even if forgiveness is also justified (Warmke &\nMcKenna 2013).\n10. The Science of Forgiveness\n\nFor much of the history of modern psychology, the topic of forgiveness\nwas largely ignored. Piaget (1932) discussed the capacity of\nforgiveness so far as it is related to the development of moral\njudgment. Litwinski (1945) produced a study on the kind of affective\nstructure that would provide one with a capacity to forgive. Emerson\n(1964) was the first to explore the association of forgiveness with\nmental health, and Heider (1958) proposed an early working definition\nof forgiveness (as the forgoing of vengeful behavior). Rokeach (1973)\npromoted forgiveness as a valuable form of conduct, but didn\u2019t\nsay much about its nature. Discussions of forgiveness as it relates to\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma situations and tit-for-tat strategies were\nnot uncommon (e.g., Gahagan & Tedeschi 1968)\u2014the idea being\nthat forgiveness could be likened to a cooperative move following a\ncompetitive move.\n\nIn the recent decades, forgiveness has enjoyed a significant increase\nin empirical attention (McCullough, et al. 2000: 6, 7). Important\nearly work during this time included papers by Boon and Sulsky (1997),\nDarby and Schlenker (1982), and Weiner, et al. (1991). Yet even after\ndecades of sustained empirical enquiry, psychologists remain divided\nabout how forgiveness ought to be defined. The \u201cmajor issue\ncharacterizing this new science of forgiveness\u201d, Everett\nWorthington writes, \u201chas been how forgiveness ought to be\ndefined\u201d (2005: 3).\n\nSome psychologists forward interpersonal models of forgiveness.\nAccording to these approaches, forgiveness is an activity involving\ncommunication (perhaps verbal, perhaps not) between agents.\nReconciliation-based models of forgiveness developed out of\nresearch in evolutionary psychology and evolutionary ethics (Sapolsky\n& Share 2004; de Waal & Pokorny 2005; Axelrod 1980a,b).\nAccording to these views, forgiveness evolved as a mechanism for\naffirming mutual cooperation between agents after an act of\ndefection.\n\nOthers have sought to define forgiveness by way of intrapersonal\nmodels. According to these models, forgiveness occurs within\none\u2019s skin, as it were. DiBlasio\u2019s (1998)\ndecision-based model views forgiveness \u201cas an act of\nthe will, a choice to let go or hold onto\u201d resentment,\nbitterness and the need for vengeance (1998: 76). McCullough and\nvarious colleagues have posited a motivational model that\nunderstands forgiveness as a process involving a decrease in\nmotivations to avoid or seek revenge, and an increase in benevolent\nand conciliatory motivations (e.g., McCullough, Fincham, & Tsang\n2003). Cognitive models conceive of forgiveness as a\nreframing of the narrative about the transgression, the transgressor\nand the forgiver (e.g., Gordon, Baucom, & Snyder 2000; Thompson,\net al. 2005). One forgives by changing one\u2019s assumptions,\nbeliefs, standards, or perceptions about the wrongdoer and the\nwrongdoing. Emotion-based models see forgiveness as being\naccomplished by the replacement of negative, unforgiving emotions\n(e.g., anger, hatred) with positive, other-oriented emotions (e.g.,\nempathy) (Worthington 2003; Malcolm & Greenberg 2000).\n\nStill others have suggested mixed models, according to which\nforgiveness has both interpersonal and intrapersonal modes or aspects.\nBaumeister, Exline, and Sommer (1998) suggest that when one feels\nforgiving towards an offender but does not communicate as much, one\nhas silently forgiven. Alternatively, when one does\nnot feel forgiving but tells the offender that she is forgiving her,\nshe accomplishes hollow forgiveness. When one both feels\nforgiving and tells the offender so, she has accomplished full\nforgiveness. Enright and Fitzgibbons (2000) have argued that in\norder to forgive, cognitive, affective, and behavioral changes must be\nmade. \n\nAs it should be clear, there is significant disagreement about the\nnature of forgiveness in the psychological sciences, leading one\nprominent psychologist of forgiveness to write that \u201cno\nconsensual definition of forgiveness exists\u201d (McCullough, et al.\n2000: 7).\n",
