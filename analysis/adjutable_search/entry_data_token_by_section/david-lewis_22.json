    "main_text": "Other Writings || Mathematics and Mereology\n7.1 Mathematics and Mereology\n\nParts of Classes (1991a) and \u201cMathematics is\nMegethology\u201d (1993d) consider the distinctive philosophical\nproblems raised by\n set theory.\n As Lewis notes, it is widely held that all of mathematics reduces to\nset theory. But there is little consensus about what the metaphysics\nof set theory is. Lewis puts forward two proposals that might,\ncollectively, help to clarify matters.\n\nThe first proposal is what he calls the Main Thesis:\n\u201cThe parts of a class are all and only its subclasses\u201d\n(1991a: 7). By \u2018class\u2019 here, Lewis does not mean\n\u2018set\u2019. Classes are things with members. Some classes are\nproper classes, and hence not sets. And one set, the null set, has no\nmembers, so is not a class. Individuals, for Lewis, are things without\nmembers. Since the null set has no members, it is an individual. But\nthe overlap between the sets and the classes is large; most sets we\nthink about are classes.\n\nThe big payoff of the Main Thesis is that it reduces the mysteries of\nset theory to a single mystery. Any class is a\n fusion of singletons,\n i.e., sets with one member. If we understand what a singleton is, and\nwe understand what fusions are, then we understand all there is to\nknow about classes, and about sets. That\u2019s because any set is\njust the fusion of the singletons of its members.\n\nBut singletons are deeply mysterious. The usual metaphors that are\nused to introduce sets, metaphors about combining or collecting or\ngathering multiple things into one are less than useless when it comes\nto understanding the relationship between a singleton and its member.\nIn (1993d), Lewis settles for a structuralist understanding of\nsingletons. He also says that he \u201cargued (somewhat reluctantly)\nfor a structuralist\u2019 approach to the theory of singleton\nfunctions\u201d in (1991a), though on page 54 of (1991a) he appears\nto offer qualified resistance to structuralism.\n\nOne of the technical advances of (1991a) and (1993d) was that they\nshowed how a structuralist account of set theory was even possible.\nThis part of the work was co-authored with John P. Burgess and A. P.\nHazen. Given a large enough universe (i.e., that the cardinality of\nthe mereological atoms is an\n inaccessible cardinal),\n and given plural quantification, we can say exactly what constraints\na function must satisfy for it to do the work we want the singleton\nfunction to do. (By \u2018the singleton function\u2019 I mean the\nfunction that maps anything that has a singleton onto its singleton.\nSince proper classes don\u2019t have singletons, and nor do fusions\nof sets and objects, this will be a partial function.) Given that, we\ncan understand mathematical claims made in terms of sets/classes as\nquantifications over singleton functions. That is, we can understand\nany claim that would previous have used \u2018the\u2019 singleton\nfunction as a claim of the form for all s:\n\u2026s\u2026s\u2026, where the terms\ns go where we would previously have referred to\n\u2018the\u2019 singleton function. It is provable that this\ntranslation won\u2019t introduce any inconsistency into mathematics\n(since there are values for s), or any indeterminacy (since\nthe embedded sentence \u2026s\u2026s\u2026 has\nthe same truth value for any eligible value for s).\n\nShould we then adopt this structuralist account, and say that we have\nremoved the mysteries of mathematics? As noted above, Lewis is\nuncharacteristically equivocal on this point, and seemed to change his\nmind about whether structuralism was, all things considered, a good or\na bad deal. His equivocation comes from two sources. One worry is that\nwhen we work through the details, some of the mysteries of set theory\nseem to have been relocated rather than solved. For instance, if we\nantecedently understood the singleton function, we might have thought\nit could be used to explain why the set theoretic universe is so\nlarge. Now we have to simply posit a very large universe. Another is\nthat the proposal is in some way revisionary, since it takes ordinary\nmathematical talk to be surreptitiously quantificational. Parts of\nClasses contains some famous invective directed against\nphilosophers who seek to overturn established science on philosophical\ngrounds.\n\nI\u2019m moved to laughter at the thought of how presumptous\nit would be to reject mathematics for philosophical reasons. How would\nyou like the job of telling the mathematicians that they must\nchange their ways, and abjure countless errors, now that\nphilosophy has discovered that there are no classes? Can you\ntell them, with a straight face, to follow philosophical argument\nwherever it may lead? If they challenge your credentials, will you\nboast of philosophy\u2019s other great discoveries: that motion is\nimpossible, that a Being than which no greater can be conceived cannot\nbe conceived not to exist, that it is unthinkable that anything exists\noutside the mind, that time is unreal, that no theory has ever been\nmade at all probable by evidence (but on the other hand that an\nempirically adequate ideal theory cannot possibly be false), that it\nis a wide-open scientific question whether anyone has ever believed\nanything, and so on, and on, ad nauseum? Not me! (1991a: 59)\n\n\nAnd yet Lewis\u2019s positive theory here is somewhat revisionary. It\ndoesn\u2019t revise the truth value of any mathematical claim, but it\ndoes revise the understanding of them. Is even this too much revision\nto make on philosophical grounds? Perhaps not, but it is worrying\nenough for Lewis to conclude merely that the theory he proposes seems\nbetter than the alternatives, not that there is a compelling positive\ncase for its truth.\n",
