    "main_text": "Ethical Views\n7. Conclusion\n\nGersonides\u2019 philosophical ideas went against the grain of\ntraditional Jewish thought; he also challenged scholastic thought.\nGlasner suggests that unlike his Christian peers who studied and\ntaught at a university, Gersonides\u2019 academic profile as rooted\nin applied mathematics and astronomy allowed him to leave metaphysics\nbehind. He offered a serious critique of Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nmotion, thus freeing himself as well from \u201cthe grip of\nAristotelian physics, and even laid down a basis for an alternative\nunderstanding of motion\u201d (Glasner 2015, p. 106). Gersonides\nreflects the following characteristics: first, his writings\ndemonstrate a fundamental interplay and harmony between astrological\nand theological beliefs. It is clear that the appeal of astrology lay\nin the fact that it offered useful information, while it looked and\noperated like a science. Even the critics of astrology had to agree\nthat the heavens exerted a real influence upon terrestrial events. The\ncomplexity of the rules of astrology and internal disagreement among\nits followers served to increase the respect accorded to the science.\nFailures did not cause the astrologer to lose faith, just as failures\namong modern physicists do not lead to loss of faith in science.\nGersonides believed that life on earth had a meaning, and that\nterrestrial events had an order. Astrology was a means of ascertaining\nthat meaning. Gersonides\u2019 views on prophecy, providence,\nfree-will and evil reflected ingredients of this philosophical\ndeterminism. Whereas his commentaries occupied a central place in\nJewish theology, his philosophical work was rejected. Jewish\nphilosophers such as Hasdai Crescas and Isaac Abrabanel felt obliged\nto subject his works to lengthy criticism. Only in recent years has\nGersonides received his rightful place in the history of philosophy.\nAs scholars have rediscovered his thought and have made his corpus\navailable to a modern audience, Gersonides is once again appreciated\nas an insightful, ruthlessly consistent philosopher.\n",
