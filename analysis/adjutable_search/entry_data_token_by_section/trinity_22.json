    "main_text": "Mysterianism\n4. Mysterianism\n\nOften \u201cmystery\u201d is used in a merely honorific sense,\nmeaning a great and important truth or thing relating to religion. In\nthis vein it\u2019s often said that the doctrine of the Trinity is a\nmystery to be adored, rather than a problem to be solved. In the Bible\na \u201cmystery\u201d (Greek: musterion) is simply a truth\nor thing which is or has been somehow hidden (i.e., rendered\nunknowable) by God (Anonymous 1691; Toulmin 1791b). In this sense a\n\u201crevealed mystery\u201d is a contradiction in terms (Whitby\n1841, 101\u20139). While Paul seems to mainly use\n\u201cmystery\u201d for what used to be hidden but is now\nknown (Tuggy 2003a, 175), it has been argued that Paul assumes that\nwhat has been revealed will continue to be in some sense\n\u201cmysterious\u201d (Boyer 2007, 98\u2013101).\n\nMysterianism is a meta-theory of the Trinity, that is, a theory about\ntrinitarian theories, to the effect that an acceptable Trinity theory\nmust, given our present epistemic limitations, to some degree lack\nunderstandable content. \u201cUnderstandable content\u201d here\nmeans propositions expressed by language which the hearer\n\u201cgrasps\u201d or understands the meaning of, and which seem to\nher to be consistent.\n\nAt its extreme, a mysterian may hold that no first-order theory of the\nTrinity is possible, so we must be content with delineating a\nconsistent \u201cgrammar of discourse\u201d about the Trinity, i.e.,\npolicies about what should and shouldn\u2019t be said about it. In\nthis extreme form, mysterianism may be a sort of sophisticated\nposition by itself\u2014to the effect that one repeats the creedal\nformulas and refuses on principle to explain how, if at all, one\ninterprets them. More common is a moderate form, where mysterianism\nsupplements a Trinity theory which has some understandable content,\nbut which is vague or otherwise problematic. Thus, mysterianism is\ncommonly held as a supplement to one of the theories of sections\n1\u20133. Again, it may serve as a supplement not to a full-blown\ntheory (i.e., to a literal model of the Trinity) but rather to one or\nmore (admittedly not very helpful) analogies. (See\n section 3.3.1\n in the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian\ndoctrines.) Unitarian views on the Father, Son, and Spirit are\ntypically motivated in part by hostility to mysterianism. (See the\nsupplementary document on\n unitarianism.)\n But the same can said of many of the theories of sections\n1\u20133.\n\nMysterians view their stance as an exercise of theological\nsophistication and epistemic humility. Some mysterians appeal to the\nmedieval tradition of apophatic or negative theology, the view that\none can understand and say what God is not, but not what God is, while\nothers simply appeal to the idea that the human mind is ill-equipped\nto think about transcendent realities.\n\nTuggy (2003a) lists five different meanings of \u201cmystery\u201d\nin the literature:\n\n[1]\u2026a truth formerly unknown, and perhaps undiscoverable by\nunaided human reason, but which has now been revealed by God and is\nknown to some\u2026 [2] something we don\u2019t completely\nunderstand\u2026 [3] some fact we can\u2019t explain, or\ncan\u2019t fully or adequately explain\u2026 [4] an unintelligible\ndoctrine, the meaning of which can\u2019t be grasped\u2026.[5] a\ntruth which one should believe even though it seems, even after\ncareful reflection, to be impossible and/or contradictory and thus\nfalse. (175\u20136)\n\n\nSophisticated mysterians about the Trinity appeal to\n\u201cmysteries\u201d in the fourth and fifth senses. The common\ncore of meaning between them is that a \u201cmystery\u201d is a\ndoctrine which is (to some degree) not understood, in the sense\nexplained above. We here call those who call the Trinity a mystery in\nthe fourth sense \u201cnegative mysterians\u201d and those who call\nit a mystery in the fifth sense \u201cpositive mysterians\u201d. It\nis most common for theologians to combine the two views, though\nusually one or the other is emphasized.\n\nSophisticated modern-era mysterians include Leibniz and the theologian\nMoses Stuart (1780\u20131852). (Antognazza 2007; Leibniz\nTheodicy, 73\u2013122; Stuart 1834, 26\u201350.)\n",
