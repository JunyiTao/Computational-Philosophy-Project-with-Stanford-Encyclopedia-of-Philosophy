    "main_text": "The Categories\n2. The Categories\n\nTo understand the problems and project of Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, it is best to begin with one of his earlier\nworks, the Categories. Although placed by long tradition\namong his logical works (see the discussion in the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s logic),\n due to its analysis of the terms that make up the propositions out of\nwhich deductive inferences are constructed, the Categories\nbegins with a strikingly general and exhaustive account of the things\nthere are (ta onta)\u2014beings. According to this account,\nbeings can be divided into ten distinct categories. (Although\nAristotle never says so, it is tempting to suppose that these\ncategories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of the things\nthere are.) They include substance, quality, quantity, and relation,\namong others. Of these categories of beings, it is the first,\nsubstance (ousia), to which Aristotle gives a privileged\nposition.\n\nSubstances are unique in being independent things; the items in the\nother categories all depend somehow on substances. That is, qualities\nare the qualities of substances; quantities are the amounts and sizes\nthat substances come in; relations are the way substances stand to one\nanother. These various non-substances all owe their existence to\nsubstances\u2014each of them, as Aristotle puts it, exists only\n\u2018in\u2019 a subject. That is, each non-substance \u201cis in\nsomething, not as a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is\nin\u201d (Cat. 1a25). Indeed, it becomes clear\nthat substances are the subjects that these ontologically dependent\nnon-substances are \u2018in\u2019.\n\nEach member of a non-substance category thus stands in this inherence\nrelation (as it is frequently called) to some substance or\nother\u2014color is always found in bodies, knowledge in the soul.\nNeither whiteness nor a piece of grammatical knowledge, for example,\nis capable of existing on its own. Each requires for its existence\nthat there be some substance in which it inheres.\n\nIn addition to this fundamental inherence relation across categories,\nAristotle also points out another fundamental relation that obtains\nbetween items within a single category. He describes this as the\nrelation of \u201cbeing said of a subject,\u201d and his examples\nmake clear that it is the relation of a more general to a less general\nthing within a single category. Thus, man is \u2018said of\u2019 a\nparticular man, and animal is \u2018said of\u2019 man, and\ntherefore, as Aristotle points out, animal is \u2018said of\u2019\nthe particular man also. The \u2018said of\u2019 relation, that is\nto say, is transitive (cf. 1b10). So the genus (e.g.,\nanimal) is \u2018said of\u2019 the species (e.g., man) and both\ngenus and species are \u2018said of\u2019 the particular. The same\nholds in non-substance categories. In the category of quality, for\nexample, the genus (color) is \u2018said of\u2019 the species\n(white) and both genus and species are \u2018said of\u2019 the\nparticular white. There has been considerable scholarly dispute about\nthese particulars in nonsubstance categories. For more detail, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nNonsubstantial Particulars\n\n\nThe language of this contrast (\u2018in\u2019 a subject vs.\n\u2018said of\u2019 a subject) is peculiar to the\nCategories, but the idea seems to recur in other works as the\ndistinction between accidental vs. essential predication. Similarly,\nin works other than the Categories, Aristotle uses the label\n\u2018universals\u2019 (ta katholou) for the things that\nare \u201csaid of many;\u201d things that are not universal he calls\n\u2018particulars\u2019 (ta kath\u2019 hekasta). Although\nhe does not use these labels in the Categories, it is not\nmisleading to say that the doctrine of the Categories is that\neach category contains a hierarchy of universals and particulars, with\neach universal being \u2018said of\u2019 the lower-level universals\nand particulars that fall beneath it. Each category thus has the\nstructure of an upside-down\n tree.[2]\n At the top (or trunk) of the tree are the most generic items in that\n category[3]\n (e.g., in the case of the category of substance, the genus plant and\nthe genus animal); branching below them are universals at the next\nhighest level, and branching below these are found lower levels of\nuniversals, and so on, down to the lowest level universals (e.g., such\ninfimae species as man and horse); at the lowest\nlevel\u2014the leaves of the tree\u2014are found the individual\nsubstances, e.g., this man, that horse, etc.\n\nThe individuals in the category of substance play a special role in\nthis scheme. Aristotle calls them \u201cprimary substances\u201d\n(pr\u00f4tai ousiai) for without them, as he says, nothing\nelse would exist. Indeed, Aristotle offers an argument\n(2a35\u20132b7) to establish the primary\nsubstances as the fundamental entities in this ontology. Everything\nthat is not a primary substance, he points out, stands in one of the\ntwo relations (inhering \u2018in\u2019, or being \u2018said\nof\u2019) to primary substances. A genus, such as animal, is\n\u2018said of\u2019 the species below it and, since they are\n\u2018said of\u2019 primary substances, so is the genus (recall the\ntransitivity of the \u2018said of\u2019 relation). Thus, everything\nin the category of substance that is not itself a primary substance\nis, ultimately, \u2018said of\u2019 primary substances. And if there\nwere no primary substances, there would be no \u201csecondary\u201d\nsubstances (species and genera), either. For these secondary\nsubstances are just the ways in which the primary substances are\nfundamentally classified within the category of substance. As for the\nmembers of non-substance categories, they too depend for their\nexistence on primary substances. A universal in a non-substance\ncategory, e.g., color, in the category of quality, is \u2018in\u2019\nbody, Aristotle tells us, and therefore in individual bodies. For\ncolor could not be \u2018in\u2019 body, in general, unless it were\n\u2018in\u2019 at least some particular bodies. Similarly,\nparticulars in non-substance categories (although there is not general\nagreement among scholars about what such particulars might be) cannot\nexist on their own. E.g., a determinate shade of color, or a\nparticular and non-shareable bit of that shade, is not capable of\nexisting on its own\u2014if it were not \u2018in\u2019 at least\nsome primary substance, it would not exist. So primary substances are\nthe basic entities\u2014the basic \u201cthings that there\nare\u201d\u2014in the world of the Categories.\n",
