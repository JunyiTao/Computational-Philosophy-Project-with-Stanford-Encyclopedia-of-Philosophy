This is how traditional Buddhist\n\u201cnon-self\u201d doctrine comes to play out in Tiantai. I think\nI am already this self, Brook, but in reality, Buddhism tells me, I am\nnot yet really any such self\u2014for to be a self is to be\nunconditional, and that is impossible for \u201cme\u201d, a\nconditional determinate being. Also, I am not yet\nenlightened\u2014for enlightenment is unconditionality, the only\nfreedom from suffering. To become unconditioned, as I\u2019d thought\nI was when I thought I was a self, is to become enlightened. This\nnon-self is the only thing that really fulfills my previous lust to be\na self, to actually be me. I cannot become this by being me\nas a determinate being to the exclusion of all other beings, nor other\nbeings to the exclusion of me. Rather, by the Three Truths, I can only\nbecome more and more me by becoming more and more everything else, and\nthat is what it means to become more and more enlightened, and to\nbecome more me, more unconditionally this specific me. To\n\u201cbecome what I am\u201d, to be a more fully realized version of\nmyself, is to see myself, Brook specifically, as unconditional, which\nmeans as omnipresent and eternal, which means as expressing itself in\nand as all things, which also means, conversely, intersubsumed, i.e.,\nas an expression of all other things, as something as which\nall other things are appearing. I cannot be myself until I am a\nBuddha, but I cannot be a Buddha until I can be more fully (i.e., more\nunconditionally, more all-pervasively) myself, and that means being\nmore fully a devil, a fool, a table, a spaceship, or, in Siming\nZhili\u2019s example, a dung beetle. Buddhist practice is the\nprogressively fuller manifestation of my latent Buddhahood\u2014which\nmeans also the progressively fuller manifestation of my latent\nDung-Beetlehood, and indeed, my allegedly long ago already actual but\nreally hitherto merely latent Brookhood.\n",
