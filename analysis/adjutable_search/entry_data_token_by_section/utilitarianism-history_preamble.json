    "main_text": "\n\n\nUtilitarianism is one of the most powerful and persuasive approaches\nto normative ethics in the history of philosophy. Though not\nfully articulated until the 19th century, proto-utilitarian\npositions can be discerned throughout the history of ethical\ntheory.\n\n\nThough there are many varieties of the view discussed,\nutilitarianism is generally held to be the view that the morally right\naction is the action that produces the most good. There are many\nways to spell out this general claim. One thing to note is that\nthe theory is a form of consequentialism: the right action is\nunderstood entirely in terms of consequences produced. What\ndistinguishes utilitarianism from egoism has to do with the scope of\nthe relevant consequences. On the utilitarian view one ought to\nmaximize the overall good \u2014 that is, consider the good of others\nas well as one's own good.\n\n\nThe Classical Utilitarians, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill,\nidentified the good with pleasure, so, like Epicurus, were hedonists\nabout value. They also held that we ought to maximize the good,\nthat is, bring about \u2018the greatest amount of good for the\ngreatest number\u2019.\n\n\nUtilitarianism is also distinguished by impartiality and\nagent-neutrality. Everyone's happiness counts the\nsame. When one maximizes the good, it is the good\nimpartially considered. My good counts for no more than\nanyone else's good. Further, the reason I have to promote\nthe overall good is the same reason anyone else has to so promote the\ngood. It is not peculiar to me.\n\n\nAll of these features of this approach to moral evaluation and/or\nmoral decision-making have proven to be somewhat controversial and\nsubsequent controversies have led to changes in the Classical version\nof the theory.\n",
