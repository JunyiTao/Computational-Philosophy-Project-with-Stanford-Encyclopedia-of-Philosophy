    "main_text": "\n\nEpistemic paradoxes are riddles that turn on the concept of knowledge\n(episteme is Greek for knowledge). Typically, there are\nconflicting, well-credentialed answers to these questions (or\npseudo-questions). Thus the riddle immediately poses an inconsistency.\nIn the long run, the riddle goads and guides us into correcting at\nleast one deep error \u2013 if not directly about knowledge, then\nabout its kindred concepts such as justification, rational belief, and\nevidence.\n\nSuch corrections are of interest to epistemologists. Historians date\nthe origin of epistemology to the appearance of skeptics. As manifest\nin Plato\u2019s dialogues featuring Socrates, epistemic paradoxes\nhave been discussed for twenty five hundred years. Given their\nhardiness, some of these riddles about knowledge may well be discussed\nfor the next twenty five hundred years.\n",
