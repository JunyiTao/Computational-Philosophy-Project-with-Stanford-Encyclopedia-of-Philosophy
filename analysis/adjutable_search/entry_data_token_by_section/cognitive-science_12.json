Another important innovation is combining learning from\nexamples with reinforcement learning, resulting by 2016 in the\nworld\u2019s leading Go player, AlphaGo. Ideas from deep learning are\nspreading back into neuroscience and also beginning to influence\nresearch in cognitive psychology. The explanatory schema for deep\nlearning is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nHow does the brain carry out functions such as cognitive\ntasks?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nThe brain has large numbers of neurons organized into 6\u201320\nlayers.\nThe brain has powerful mechanisms for learning from examples and\nfor learning actions that are reinforced by their successes.\nApplying learning mechanisms to layered neural networks makes them\ncapable of human and sometimes even super-human performance.\n\n\n\nAlthough deep learning has produced dramatic improvements in some AI\nsystems, it is not clear how it can be applied to aspects of human\nthought that include causal reasoning, imagery, emotion, and analogy.\nFor further discussion, see Section 11 (on deep learning) of the entry\non\n connectionism.\n4.10 Predictive processing and active inference\n\nPredictive processing is an approach to theoretical neuroscience that\nviews the brain as constantly generating and updating models of the\nenvironment in order to predict the results of perceptions and\nactions. Active inference is a version of predictive processing that\nhypothesizes that the brain uses Bayesian calculations to minimize\n\u201cfree energy\u201d consisting of discrepancies between\nexpectations and actual observations. Organisms survive when brains\nreduce prediction errors by changing their models of the environment\nor by changing the environment through action.\n\nThe explanatory schema for active inference is:\n\nExplanation target:\n\nHow does the brain function to support perception and action?\n Explanatory pattern:\n\nThe brain is a prediction engine that uses probabilistic models to\nanticipate perceptions and the results of actions.\nTo reduce prediction error, the brain uses Bayesian updating to\nchange its models and uses actions to change its environment, e.g. by\nmoving.\nEffective inference, perception, and action result from these\nreductions in prediction errors.\n\n\n\nActive inference is open to numerous challenges. Is brain functioning\nreally Bayesian updating rather than connectionist constraint\nsatisfaction or deep reinforcement learning? Can predictive processing\nsubsume other brain functions that include pattern recognition,\nexplanation, emotional evaluation, memory, and communication? Does\nactive inference explain high-level cognitive operations such as\ncausal reasoning, language, and creativity?\n5. Philosophical Relevance\n\nSome philosophy, in particular naturalistic philosophy of mind, is\npart of cognitive science. But the interdisciplinary field of\ncognitive science is relevant to philosophy in several ways. First,\nthe psychological, computational, and other results of cognitive\nscience investigations have important potential applications to\ntraditional philosophical problems in epistemology, metaphysics, and\nethics. Second, cognitive science can serve as an object of\nphilosophical critique, particularly concerning the central assumption\nthat thinking is representational and computational. Third and more\nconstructively, cognitive science can be taken as an object of\ninvestigation in the philosophy of science, generating reflections on\nthe methodology and presuppositions of the enterprise.\n5.1 Philosophical Applications\n\nMuch philosophical research today is naturalistic, treating\nphilosophical investigations as continuous with empirical work in\nfields such as psychology. From a naturalistic perspective, philosophy\nof mind is closely allied with theoretical and experimental work in\ncognitive science. Metaphysical conclusions about the nature of mind\nare to be reached, not by a priori speculation, but by informed\nreflection on scientific developments in fields such as psychology,\nneuroscience, and computer science. Similarly, epistemology is not a\nstand-alone conceptual exercise, but depends on and benefits from\nscientific findings concerning mental structures and learning\nprocedures. Ethics can benefit by using greater understanding of the\npsychology of moral thinking to bear on ethical questions such as the\nnature of deliberations concerning right and wrong. Here are some\nphilosophical problems to which ongoing developments in cognitive\nscience are highly relevant. Links are provided to other relevant\narticles in this Encyclopedia.\n\nInnateness.\n To what extent is knowledge innate or acquired by experience? Is\nhuman behavior shaped primarily by nature or nurture?\nLanguage of thought.\n Does the human brain operate with a language-like code or with a more\ngeneral\n connectionist\n architecture? What is the relation between symbolic cognitive models\nusing rules and concepts and sub-symbolic models using neural\nnetworks?\nMental imagery.\n Do human minds think with visual and other kinds of imagery, or only\nwith language-like representations?\nFolk psychology.\n Does a person\u2019s everyday understanding of other people consist\nof having a theory of mind, or of merely being able to simulate\nthem?\nMeaning.\n How do\n mental representations\n acquire meaning or\n mental content?\n To what extent does the meaning of a representation depend on its\nrelation to other representations, its relation to the world, and its\nrelation to a community of thinkers?\nMind-brain identity.\n Are mental states brain states? Or can they be\n multiply realized\n by other material states? What is the relation between psychology and\nneuroscience? Is\n materialism\n true?\nFree will.\n Is human action free or merely caused by brain events?\nMoral psychology.\n How do minds/brains make ethical judgments?\nThe meaning of life.\n How can minds construed naturalistically as brains find value and\nmeaning?\nEmotions.\n What are emotions, and what role do they play in thinking?\nConsciousness.\n Can conscious experience be scientifically explained, for example by\nthe\n neuroscience of consciousness?\nMental disorder.\n What are mental disorders, and how are psychological and neural\nprocesses relevant to their explanation and treatment?\nPerception and reality.\n How do minds/brains form and evaluate representations of the external\nworld?\nPerception and cognition.\n How does perception differ from other kinds of cognition with respect\nto representational format and justification?\nRealism.\n Is cognitive science consistent with views that minds grasp the real\nworld? Could minds be computer simulations? Is virtual reality a kind\nof reality?\nInformation.\n How does cognitive science illuminate the operations of information\nand misinformation in minds and societies?\nSocial science.\n How do explanations of the operations of minds interact with\nexplanations of the operations of groups and societies?\n\n\nAdditional philosophical problems arise from examining the\npresuppositions of current approaches to cognitive science.\n5.2 Critique of Cognitive Science\n\nThe claim that human minds work by representation and computation is\nan empirical conjecture and might be wrong. Although the\n computational-representational\n approach to cognitive science has been successful in explaining many\naspects of human problem solving, learning, and language use, some\nphilosophical critics have claimed that this approach is fundamentally\nmistaken. Critics of cognitive science have offered such challenges\nas:\n\nThe\n emotion\n challenge: Cognitive science neglects the important role of emotions\nin human thinking.\nThe\n consciousness\n challenge: Cognitive science ignores the importance of consciousness\nin human thinking.\nThe world challenge: Cognitive science disregards the significant\nrole of physical environments in human thinking, which is embedded in\nand extended into the world.\nThe body challenge: Cognitive science neglects the contribution of\n embodiment\n to human thought and action.\nThe dynamical systems challenge: The mind is a dynamical system,\nnot a computational system.\nThe social challenge: Human thought is inherently social in ways\nthat cognitive science ignores.\nThe mathematics challenge: Mathematical results show that human\nthinking cannot be computational in the standard sense, so the brain\nmust operate differently, perhaps as a quantum computer.\nThe interdisciplinarity challenge: Cognitive science has failed to\ngo beyond multidisciplinary interactions by developing a core theory\nthat unifies work in its many disciplines.\n\n\nThe first five challenges are increasingly addressed by advances that\nexplain emotions, consciousness, action, and embodiment in terms of\nneural mechanisms. The social challenge is being met by the\ndevelopment of computational models of interacting agents. The\nmathematics challenge is based on misunderstanding of\n G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem\n and on exaggeration of the relevance of quantum theory to neural\nprocesses. Response to the interdisciplinary challenge must recognize\nthat cognitive science still has many contending theoretical\napproaches, without the unification that theories of evolution and\ngenetics provide for biology. Nevertheless, interactions among\npsychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and\ncomputer modeling have contributed to theoretical and empirical\nprogress concerning many aspects of cognition. For example,\n computational philosophy\n uses programmed models to address questions in epistemology, ethics,\nand other areas of philosophy.\n5.3 Philosophy of Cognitive Science\n\nCognitive science raises many interesting methodological questions\nthat are worthy of investigation by philosophers of science. What is\nthe nature of representation? What role do computational models play\nin the development of cognitive theories? What is the relation among\napparently competing accounts of mind involving symbolic processing,\nneural networks, and dynamical systems? What is the relation among the\nvarious fields of cognitive science such as psychology, linguistics,\nand neuroscience? Are psychological phenomena subject to reductionist\nexplanations via neuroscience? Are levels of explanation best\ncharacterized in terms of ontological levels (molecular, neural,\npsychological, social) or methodological ones (computational,\nalgorithmic, physical)?\n\nThe increasing prominence of neural explanations in cognitive, social,\ndevelopmental, and clinical psychology raises important philosophical\nquestions about\n explanation\n and\n reduction.\n Anti-reductionism, according to which psychological explanations are\ncompletely independent of neurological ones, is becoming increasingly\nimplausible, but it remains controversial to what extent psychology\ncan be reduced to neuroscience and molecular biology. Crucial to\nanswering questions about the nature of reduction are answers to\nquestions about the nature of explanation. Explanations in psychology,\nneuroscience, and biology in general are plausibly viewed as\ndescriptions of\n mechanisms,\n which are combinations of connected parts that interact to produce\nregular changes. In psychological explanations, the parts are mental\nrepresentations that interact by computational procedures to produce\nnew representations. In neuroscientific explanations, the parts are\nneural populations that interact by electrochemical processes to\nproduce new neural activity that leads to actions. If progress in\ntheoretical neuroscience continues, it should become possible to tie\npsychological to neurological explanations by showing how mental\nrepresentations such as concepts are constituted by activities in\nneural populations, and how computational procedures such as spreading\nactivation among concepts are carried out by neural processes.\n\nThe increasing integration of cognitive psychology with neuroscience\nprovides evidence for the\n mind-brain identity theory\n according to which mental processes are neural, representational, and\ncomputational. Other philosophers dispute such identification on the\ngrounds that minds are embodied in biological systems and extended\ninto the world. However, moderate claims about embodiment are\nconsistent with the identity theory because brain representations\noperate in several modalities (e.g. visual and motor) that enable\nminds to deal with the world. Another materialist alternative to\nmind-brain identity comes from recognizing that explanations of mind\nemploy molecular and social mechanisms as well as neural and\nrepresentational ones.",
