How these findings shed\nlight on the character of evolutionary change is well illustrated by\nthe research of inheritable immune variation. The origin of variation\nhas been subject to much debate in philosophy of biology. Advocates of\nthe view that nonrandom, environmentally induced factors are involved\nin the generation of inheritable variation cite evidence of\nstress-induced mutagenesis, horizontal gene transfer, and non-genetic\nsystems of inheritance (Koonin 2012: 257\u2013291). Such discoveries\nsuggest that organisms may enhance their own adaptation to altered\nenvironmental conditions epigenetically (Jablonka and Lamb 2014; J.\nShapiro 2011). Specialized diversification and recombination\nmechanisms that are used by organisms to enhance their own adaptation\nare considered Lamarckian in so far as the response to specific\nenvironmental cues leads to alterations of phenotypic features, and\nthese adaptive characteristics may be transmitted to succeeding\ngenerations (Sarkar 1991; Depew and Weber 1996). Notwithstanding\nevidence for such mechanisms, postulated non-random mechanisms of\nevolution have been disputed by those who claim that appeals to\nLamarckism are misguided and stem from mis-interpreting the\nNeo-Darwinian synthesis or from overlooking genes as the basic units\nof selection (Merlin 2010; Weiss 2015). With a focus on rapidly\nadapting and evolving cell populations, immunological studies provide\na unique opportunity to investigate evolution in real time and to\nunderstand the role of non-random, inheritable alterations of the\nphenotype.\n\nExamination of adaptive immunity in prokaryotes provides a major\nbreakthrough in this controversy. Many bacteria and most Archaea\nundergo non-random changes directed at devising protection from\ninvasive bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements (Horvath and\nBarrangou 2010). These microbes use specialized methods of defense,\nCRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas\n(CRISPR-associated protein) systems to incorporate foreign DNA\nfragments into their genomes (Koonin 2019). These become templates for\nthe formation of RNA molecules, which when associated with\nendonuclease enzymes, mediate destruction of the complementary,\nforeign DNA fragments. These acquired adaptive changes are a direct\nconsequence of the organism\u2019s interactions with the environment,\nand, because these modifications can be passed on to succeeding\ngenerations, the CRISPR-Cas system has been suggested to operate on\nLamarckian principles, an interpretation that has been contested\n(Koonin 2012: 265; Koonin 2019; Pradeu 2019). Although not conforming to the neo-Darwinian model, this system lacks the teleological character postulated by Lamarck, and thus should be considered, at most, a model of directed mutagenesis (Wideman et al. 2019; Woolley et al. 2019; Weiss 2015).\nOthers counter that a continuum of Lamarckian-Darwinian mechanisms\nexists in nature and that CRISPR-Cas represents a genuine case of\nLamarckinism (Jablonka 2019; Koonin and Wolf 2016). Advocates of this latter interpretation place CRISPR-Cas systems among other apparently Lamarckian mechanisms like those mediating epigenetic inheritance\n(Gissis and Jablonka 2011).\n\nHighlighting the importance of directed mutagenesis and programmed\ngene rearrangements in evolution, these studies potentially revise\ndominant theories of adaptation. Indeed, such genetic changes operate\nin the vertebrate adaptive immune system: The first exposure of\nantigen leads to selection of a diverse population of lymphocytes,\neach carrying antigen receptors of a single specificity with varying\ndegrees of affinity for the newly introduced antigen; the stochastic\nbut coordinated assembly of gene segments determines receptor binding\nfitness (Tonegawa, et al. 1974; Podolsky and Tauber 1997). Higher\ndegrees of specificity arise through a class of lymphocytes (B cells),\nwhose activation by a specific antigen induces further variation and\nselection. This mechanism exhibits hypermutation, in which rearranged\nantigen receptor genes are subjected to scattered, random point\nmutations to permit rapid selection of a cell variant with an enhanced\nbinding fitness. As the process of hypermutation acts on pre-selected\ncells to improve adaptive fit of their receptors, its outcomes are\npartially biased, failing to exactly fit into the Neo-Darwinian scheme\n(cf. Dobzhansky 1970). Thus, in the course of antigenic exposure, the\npopulation of lymphocytes that recognize a newly introduced antigen\ncollectively generates an increasingly effective pool of responsive\ncells by fine-tuning the specificity of immune receptors, a process\nthat exemplifies non-random selection and adaptation (Simon,\nHollander, and McMichael 2015).\n\nFurther revising our understanding of adaptation is the observation that maternal antibodies may be passed on to descendants, allowing progeny to inherit some of the acquired immune characteristics of their parents. An example of such vertical immune transfer has been found in\nstudies of the composition of the microbiota mothers pass on to the\ninfant through vaginal and breastfeeding routes that program the\nnewborn\u2019s immune system and metabolism (Mueller et al. 2015;\nGomez de Ag\u00fcero et al. 2016). By molding the composition of its\nmicrobiota during pregnancy, the mother\u2019s immune system\nengineers its environment by constructing a microbial model for her\noffspring (Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015; Mueller et al. 2015). When dysbiotic\nmicrobial populations are transmitted by obese mothers, their\nmetabolic abnormalities and associated pro-inflammatory phenotype are\nimprinted upon their children (Soderborg et al. 2018; Ley et al.\n2005). Due to the reliance on microbial niche construction, the\nacquisition of an infant\u2019s immune characteristics is an instance\nof ecological inheritance, where transmission of selective pressures\nfrom one generation to another pre-sets the process of the\nprogeny\u2019s adaptation to the environment (Odling-Smee, Laland,\nand Feldman 2003; Odling-Smee et al. 2013; Chiu and S. Gilbert 2015).\nAlterations in this ecological mode of immune transmission in humans\nby C-section or administration of antibiotics may compromise the\nhealth of the child and thus predispose them to a variety of\nimmune-related disorders (e.g., allergy and autoimmunity) (Bokulich et\nal. 2016). Thus, adaptive immunity exhibits various modalities in which variation may be generated and transferred from one generation to another. These findings challenge traditional Darwinian and Lamarckian categories, with wide-ranging ramifications.\n\nFinally, immunology contributes to a general account of selection\n(Darden and Cain 1989; Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). The clonal\nselection theory (CST), the foundational framework of modern\nimmunology, states that the immune system relies on a Darwinian-like\nprocess of selection to permit differential expansion of lymphocytes,\nwhose receptors are fitted to bind an antigen (Burnet 1959). Analogies\nbetween CST, natural selection theory, and selective theories in\nneuroscience have been generally regarded as examples of \u201ca\nselection type theory\u201d (Darden and Cain 1989). CST has also been\ncompared to other selective theories to elaborate a general vision\nof selection as cycles of replication, variation and environmental\ninteraction (Hull, Langman, and Glenn 2001). Such a general account of\nselection would not only elucidate the most fundamental principles of\nevolution, but would also serve as a guide for future selective\ntheories, e.g., neural group selection (cf. Edelman 1974, 1987).\nDifferences between selection theories have also been recognized and\nsuggest that unlike evolution of species, selection in somatic systems\n(in particular the neural system) does not fully account for the\nadaptation of the developing populations (Dumouchel 1996). More\ngenerally, Piattelli-Palmarini suggested that such a general scheme\ncould be of use in cognitive science and linguistics, as well as in\nother disciplinary domains outside of biology (Piattelli-Palmarini\n1986).\n",
