    "main_text": "Formal Epistemology\n4. Formal Epistemology\n\nFormal epistemology is concerned with the examination of traditional\nepistemological questions using the formal tools of logic and\nprobability. There has been a small but important group of Latin\nAmerican researchers working within this subfield of\nepistemology\u2014sometimes in close collaboration with scholars from\nthe United States, Europe, and Australia\u2014particularly on such\ntopics as belief change, Bayesian epistemology, and theory choice.\n\nArgentina has been the main center of development of the subfield of\nformal epistemology in Latin America, beginning in the mid-1980s. The\nfirst central figure was the Argentinian Carlos Alchourr\u00f3n\n(1931\u20131996), who obtained his B.A. in law and his Ph.D. in law\nand social sciences at the Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), where he\ntaught until his death. He was one of the founders of the Sociedad\nArgentina de An\u00e1lisis Filos\u00f3fico (on which see\n Section 1).\n He also founded, at UBA\u2019s philosophy department, a logic group\nthat would eventually incorporate researchers working on artificial\nintelligence at UBA\u2019s computer science department. The\ninterdisciplinary group became a hotbed of formal epistemology.\n\nAlchourr\u00f3n\u2019s main line of research concerned the theory\nof belief change, which basically deals with the question of how a\nbelief set is to be updated in light of new information. In 1985 he\npublished, together with Peter G\u00e4ndenfors and David Makinson, a\nseminal article in which they advanced an axiomatic theory that has\ncome to be known as \u201cthe AGM theory of belief change\u201d,\n\u201cthe AGM account of the logic of belief change\u201d, or\n\u201cthe AGM theory of belief revision\u201d (Alchourr\u00f3n,\nG\u00e4ndenfors, & Makinson 1985; cf. Alchourr\u00f3n &\nMakinson 1982, 1985, 1986). The AGM theory identifies three types of\nbelief change: expansion, contraction, and revision, focusing on the\nlast two. Roughly put, expansion consists in adding to a given belief\nset a new belief that does not conflict with the current beliefs of\nthe set; contraction involves removing a belief from the set; and\nrevision amounts to adding a new belief to the set and removing others\nfrom it so that the resulting set stays consistent. The AGM theory\nproposes six basic and two supplementary postulates for each of the\ntwo operations of contraction and revision that every appropriate\nbelief-change method must satisfy. Since its appearance in 1985, the\nAGM theory has had a tremendous impact on subsequent discussions of\nbelief change, becoming the predominant paradigm, even though some of\nits main assumptions have been questioned and several modifications or\nextensions of it have been proposed (for an overview, see\nArl\u00f3-Costa & Ferm\u00e9 2010 and Hansson 2011; see also\nFerm\u00e9 & Hansson 2011, which is a special issue on the\noccasion of the 25 years of the AGM theory). The theory has also had a\nconsiderable influence on research on artificial intelligence (on\nwhich see Carnota & Rodr\u00edguez 2010). Towards the end of his\nlife, Alchourr\u00f3n\u2019s work focused on the logic of\ndefeasible conditionals (Alchourr\u00f3n 1993, 1995, 1996; see\nFerm\u00e9 & Rodr\u00edguez 2006 for an analysis of his theory\nof conditionals).\n\nA second key contributor to the development of formal epistemology,\nnot only in Latin America but worldwide, was Horacio Arl\u00f3-Costa\n(1956\u20132011). Born in Montevideo (Uruguay), he pursued his\nundergraduate studies at UBA, obtaining his B.A. in philosophy under\nthe supervision of Alchourr\u00f3n, and was a member of\nAlchourr\u00f3n\u2019s logic group since its founding. He later on\nobtained his Ph.D. in philosophy at Columbia University under the\nsupervision of Isaac Levi, with whom he would collaborate in a number\nof publications. From 1997 until his death, he worked at Carnegie\nMellon University, where he helped found the Center for Formal\nEpistemology. Arl\u00f3-Costa made significant contributions to the\nstudy of the logic of belief change (Arl\u00f3-Costa 1990, 2006;\nArl\u00f3-Costa & Levi 2006), conditionals (Arl\u00f3-Costa\n1995, 1999; Arl\u00f3-Costa & Levi 1996), Bayesian epistemology\n(Arl\u00f3-Costa 2001, Arl\u00f3-Costa & Thomason 2001,\nArl\u00f3-Costa & Parikh 2005, Arl\u00f3-Costa & Pedersen\n2012), and rationality and decision theory (Arl\u00f3-Costa 1996;\nArl\u00f3-Costa, Collins, & Levi 1995; Arl\u00f3-Costa &\nHelzner 2010; Arl\u00f3-Costa & Pedersen 2011, 2013). (For a\nbrief presentation of Arl\u00f3-Costa\u2019s original contributions\nto those subjects as well as to modal logic, see Cresto 2011.)\n\nAnother former student of Alchourr\u00f3n to be mentioned is the\nArgentinian Eduardo Ferm\u00e9 (b. 1964), who was also a member of\nAlchourr\u00f3n\u2019s group when it became interdisciplinary.\nCurrently a professor at the Universidad de Madeira (Portugal), he\nobtained his B.A. and Ph.D. in computer science at UBA, and his Ph.D.\nin philosophy at the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden).\nFerm\u00e9\u2019s research has focused mainly on theory contraction\nand on epistemic entrenchment, extending or modifying in several of\nhis publications the AGM theory (Ferm\u00e9 1998, 2000, 2001;\nFerm\u00e9 & Hansson 1999; Ferm\u00e9 & Reis 2013).\n\nA leading international specialist in database theory, the Argentinian\nAlberto Mendelzon (1951\u20132005), also deserves a mention because\nof his key contribution to the theory of belief change. He obtained a\nB.Sc. from UBA as well as a M.S.E., a M.A., and a Ph.D. from Princeton\nUniversity. From 1980 until his death, he taught at the University of\nToronto. He also contributed to the creation of UBA\u2019s computer\nscience department in the early 1980s. In 1992 he published, together\nwith Hirofumi Katsuno, a highly influential paper that addresses the\nissue of updating knowledge bases (Katsuno & Mendelzon 1992). They\ndistinguished between two kinds of modification to a knowledge base:\nupdate and revision. While the former consists in\nbringing the knowledge base up to date when the world it describes\nchanges, the latter consists in modifying the knowledge base when new\ninformation about a static world is acquired. Mendelzon and Katsuno\nclaimed that the AGM postulates describe only revision and\nhence that, in order to describe update, the AGM theory\nshould be considerably modified by adding new postulates. (On\nMendelzon\u2019s work on belief change, see also Katsuno &\nMendelzon 1989 and 1991.)\n\nRegarding formal epistemology in Argentina, one may finally refer to a\nnumber of works by Eleonora Cresto, who completed her Ph.D. under the\nsupervision of Isaac Levi. Her first publications in the field were\nconcerned with formal belief-revision theories (Cresto 2008, 2010b).\nShe later on offered a defense of a moderate version of the so-called\nKK principle\u2014according to which if S knows that\np, then S knows that she knows that\np\u2014as a normative rather than descriptive epistemic\nprinciple. Her defense of such a principle of epistemic transparency\nis different from that traditionally proposed by epistemic\ninternalists inasmuch as her argument is a formal one that appeals to\nlower- and higher-order probabilities (Cresto 2012). Cresto\u2019s\nmore recent research in the subfield of formal epistemology focuses on\nsuch topics as group knowledge and probability aggregation (Cresto\n2015a, 2016, 2017).\n\nResearch in formal epistemology has also been important in Brazil,\nwhere several researchers from artificial intelligence and computer\nscience have examined the application of belief-change theory to\nvarious areas. Among them one may mention Odinaldo Rodrigues (b. 1968)\nand Renata Wassermann (b. 1971).\n\nRodrigues, who has been teaching at King\u2019s College London since\n1998, obtained his B.Sc. in computer science at the Universidade de\nFortaleza, his MSc in computer science at the Universidade Federal do\nRio de Janeiro, and his Ph.D. in computing at Imperial College London.\nHe has applied the principles of belief change to non-classical\nlogics, software engineering, and social choice theory (Gabbay &\nRodrigues 1996; Gabbay, Pigozzi, & Rodrigues 2006, 2007; Gabbay,\nRodrigues, & Russo 2008; Gabbay, Rodrigues, & Pigozzi\n2009).\n\nWassermann obtained her B.Sc. in computer science and her M.Sc. in\napplied mathematics at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), and\nher Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Amsterdam. She is\nat present a professor at USP\u2019s computer science department and\na member of the research group \u201cL\u00f3gica,\nIntelig\u00eancia Artificial e M\u00e9todos Formais\u201d (LIAMF),\nwhich was founded in 2000 at USP and is one of the most active Latin\nAmerican groups working on belief change. Wassermann has published\nextensively in this field, examining local belief change and applying\nthe AGM theory to non-classical logics and to computer science\n(Wassermann 1999; Chopra, Parikh, & Wassermann 2001; Hansson &\nWassermann 2002; Ribeiro, Wassermann, Flouris, & Antoniou 2013;\nWassermann & Ribeiro 2015).\n",
