Substantial change as coming-to-be\n\nChange in substance is the main subject of Aristotle\u2019s De\ngeneratione et corruptione although the other two kinds are\nexamined too, namely, growth and alteration. Substantial change\nimplies absolute coming-to-be and perishing, and first matter is\nassumed as their ground; it takes place in an absolute, unqualified\nway (hapl\u014ds) (GC 317a 32\u201334); absolute coming-to-be and\nperishing divide again into simple (haplous) and composite\n(synthetos) forms. The Arabic uses \u02bbal\u00e1\nal-i\u1e6dl\u0101q for \u2018absolutely,\u2019 and\nbas\u012b\u1e6d for \u2018simple\u2019.\n\nAverroes wrote a Middle and a Short Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatise and his approach is somewhat different in each one. The Short\nCommentary or Epitome places the treatise in the context of\nAristotle\u2019s works. We are told that the book belongs after the\nDe Caelo and that \u201cin an earlier work,\u201d i.e., the\nPhysics change in place was examined. Growth was \nexamined in the books On the Soul and On Animals,\nand coming-to-be was also studied in the Meteorologica (Averroes,\nSC GC En, 113), but its treatment is now different: \n\n\nWith regard to simple generation, he explains it here completely , but\nwith regard to the generation of composite [bodies], he does it, in\nthis book, at the level of the genus of the topic (amr),\ngiving account of its principles and elements\n(us\u1e6duqus\u0101t) (Averroes, SC GC Ar, 3: 11\u20134: 2\nArabic).\n\n\nAverroes divides the genus of coming-to-be and perishing into two\nkinds simple and composite. Simple generation is found in the\nso-called elements (us\u1e6duqus\u0101t) and chapters 1\u20138 of\nBook II of De generatione identify them as Earth, Air, Fire,\nand Water and justify why they are only these four and how they change\ninto each other. The issue of the ether, the fifth element, is left\naside in this treatise. No need saying that his argumentation is based\non the preeminence of the sense of touch, something which is obviously\nquestionable, but the classification was successful for many\ncenturies.\n\nFor a modern reader, more important than the reality of the four\nelements seems to be Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the contrarieties\nas well as the double dimension active and passive of their potencies\n(in particular, c. 2, 329b 7 \u2013 330a 29). Joachim considers that\nthe contrarieties (enanti\u014dseis) in Aristotle are merely\n\u201ccouples of contrasted qualities\u201d (Aristotle, GC Joachim\n1926, 200\u2013201) but Averroes was more specific and wrote\nal-muta\u1e0d\u1e0da\u1e0d\u0101t al-\u016bl\u00e1 /\nal-uwwal, the primary contrarieties (contrarietates\nprimae, haphakhim re\u2019shonim) so that we should\nlook for the reasons of his precision.\n\nSince Philoponos\u2019 commentary is extant, we may turn to it for\nhis interpretation of the passage (Philoponus GC Gr 1897, 213: 1\u2013223: 27). For him Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the contrarieties\nconsiders them as principles, arkhai. There are three\nprinciples according to Philoponus: matter is the first principle,\nform \u201cwhich is the contrariety\u201d is the second, and the\nthird is the simple body. (Philoponus, 123) The translation by\nWilliams reads that :\u201cthe principles are three, first matter, second\nthe enmattered form which is the same as the contrarieties, and third\nthe simple bodies which he says come to be out of matter when it takes\non the contrarieties\u201d (Philoponus 2013, 123).\n\nAverroes knew the commentary and therefore, that they were principles\nand that they were on the same level as first matter. One should not\ndismiss the possible reading \u201cprimary contrarieties\u201d in\nthe Arabic translation used by Averroes. The Aristotelian tradition\ntaught him that hotness/coldness and dryness/moistness are principles.\nFurthermore, the capacity of acting was related to one of the members\nof the couple of primary contrarieties, and that of being affected to\nthe second. Their dual combination was substantial form, and Averroes\nstressed it: \u201cThe proximate matter of the simple bodies is the\nprime matter, as has already been shown, and their forms are the\nprimary contrarieties existing in them\u201d (Averroes, SC GC, 27:\n6\u20138). The Middle Commentary expresses the very conclusion in similar\nterms (MC GC En, 70)\n\nAs for the question whether the \u201cprimary contrarieties\u201d\n--as enmattered form-- are active or passive powers, Philoponus\ncommented on GC 329b 24 \u2013 26 and observed that the elementary\nqualities, or contrarieties, have a power to act and a capacity to be\naffected, and that \u201cin the case of their coming-to-be from one\nanother they are all alike capable both of acting and of being\naffected\u201d (Philoponus 2013, 128). Avempace was very sensitive to\nthe issue and extended in an excursus when writing his own commentary\nand was clear in accepting an active and a passive power in each\nelement, for instance, in the element water (Avempace 1994,\n65).Averroes, in the Epitome, summarized Aristotle\u2019s views that\nonly hotness/coldness and dryness/moistness can be the primary\ncontrarieties because they are powers, quw\u00e1, while\nheaviness and lightness, in spite of their being tangible qualities,\nare not. Averroes insisted:.\n\n\nAs for heavy and light, however, although they are present in the\nsimple bodies, they do not belong to them insofar as they are elements\nsince they are neither active nor passive forces [powers], whereas the\nforms by reason of which the simple bodies are elements must\nnecessarily be active and passive (Averroes, SC GC En, 124) (SC GC Ar,\n30: 2\u20135). \n\n\nWhen it comes to the Middle Commentary, and to the words of Aristotle\ndescribing \u201chot and cold\u201d and \u201cdry and moist\u201d\n(GC 329b 24\u201326), Averroes reflects on the sense of the terms and\nexpresses his doubts about their right meaning. Their description does\nnot match the meaning that the term has in the colloquial language,\nnor the various meanings collected by lexicologists, and maybe those\nwho theorize about them, understand them differently, he doubts.\nFinally, Averroes writes that \u201chot and cold\u201d and\n\u201cdry and moist\u201d are\n\n\nThings whose existence in these qualities is evident in itself, i.e.,\nthese actions described by them [are evident]; the descriptions are\ntaken from their properties. However in that [the Greek] language they\n[the descriptions] happen to be generally accepted and intellectually\napprehended which prove the names given to them. For us they are only\nintellectually apprehended (ma\u02bbq\u016bl), not generally\naccepted (mashh\u016br) (Averroes, MC GC Ar, 92: \n  5\u20138).[13]\n\n\n\nTherefore, Averroes will use \u201chot and cold\u201d and \u201cdry\nand moist\u201d only as intellectually apprehended concepts, namely,\nprimary contrarieties and consider them \u201cthe specific\ndifferences (fu\u1e63\u016bl) of the elements\u201d\n(Averroes, MC GC Ar 2005, 92: 9). Averroes does not deny the primary\ncontrarieties to be powers, but in the Middle Commentary, he\nunderlines the genus/species classification. The Short Commentary\nfollows the line of the primary contrarieties and produces following\nsyllogism:\n\n\n[Minor premise] These four bodies are those bodies in which the\nprimary contrarieties exist and their number is equal to the number of\nthe possible compositions of the primary contrarieties.\n\n\n\n[Major premise] The bodies in which are existing those primary\ncontrarieties and whose number is equal to the number of the\ncontrarieties are the elements.\n\n\n\n[Conclusion] Therefore, the elements are those bodies and their number\nis equal to the number of those bodies (Averroes, SC GC Ar, 35) (SC GC\nEn, 127).\n\n\nThe Middle Commentary does not make recourse to the syllogism but both\ncommentaries agree on the conclusion \u201cthat all bodies are\ncomposed out of all of the four bodies which are called\nelements\u201d (Averroes, MC GC En, 96). Quantities of fire, air,\nwater, and earth \u2013 even minimal parts-- are the ultimate\ncomponents of tissues and limbs, or organs.\n\nSince Averroes was very aware that any philosophical enquiry is about\ncauses, this was also the case in the investigation concerning the\ngenerated and corruptible beings. The elements are composed of matter\nand form but they cannot be generated out of one another, nor can they\ncombine with each other and generate composite bodies unless the third\nprinciple intervenes, and this principle is the efficient cause\n(f\u0101\u02bbil) . The efficient cause is present in all\nchanges, and requires a previous local motion. There is a local motion\nwhich is inherent, natural to each kind of element, and another which\nis external. The latter brings two elements in contact, one acts and\nthe other reacts, so that a mixture is produced. The mixture is the\nlast condition for the coming-to-be or perishing of the elements.\nAristotle and his disciple, Averroes, were convinced that the\nexplanation should be true.\n",
