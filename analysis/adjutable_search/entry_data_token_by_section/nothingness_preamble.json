    "main_text": "\n\nSince metaphysics is the study of what exists, one might expect\nmetaphysicians to have little to say about the limit case in which\nnothing exists. But around the fifth century BCE in China, India, and\nGreece, philosophers turned from what is, to what is not (Sorensen 2022).\nEver since, there has been commentary on omissions, holes, vacuums,\nand the possibility of an empty world.\n\nThis survey starts with nothingness at a global scale and then\nexplores local pockets of nothingness. Let\u2019s begin with a\nquestion that Martin Heidegger famously characterized as the most\nfundamental issue of philosophy.\n",
