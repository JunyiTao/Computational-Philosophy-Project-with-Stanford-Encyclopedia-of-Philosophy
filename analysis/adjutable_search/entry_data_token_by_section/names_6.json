    "main_text": "Semantics || The Cluster Theory\n2.6 The Cluster Theory\n\nSuppose we are convinced, perhaps by arguments already given, that\nthe teacher of Plato and Xenophon is not, by itself, a\nsatisfactory specification of the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d.\nWe might beat an orderly retreat, maintaining that it is still part of\nthat meaning. Instead of being specifiable as a single succinct\ncondition, the meaning of \u201cSocrates\u201d is constructed from a\ncluster of similar conditions.\n\nStrawson, though he did not think names were meaningful, proposed that\nthe referent of a specific name was determined by the collection of\nidentifying descriptions associated with the name in the\ncommunity:\n\n\nSuppose we take a group of speakers who use, or think they use, the\nname, \u201cSocrates\u201d, with the same reference. Suppose we then\nask each member of the group to write down what he considers to be the\nsalient facts about Socrates, and then form from these lists of facts\na composite description incorporating the most frequently mentioned\nfacts. Now it would be too much to say that the success of\nterm-introduction within the group by means of the name requires that\nthere should exist just one person of whom all the propositions in the\ncomposite description are true. But it would not be too much to say\nthat it requires that there should exist one and only one person of\nwhom some reasonable proportion of these propositions is true. If, for\nexample, it should be found that there was just one person of whom\nhalf the propositions were jointly true, and just one person, a\ndifferent one, of whom the other half of the propositions were jointly\ntrue, then, unless some indication were given of which Socrates was\nmeant, it would become impossible to give a straightforward answer to\nthe question, whether any particular \u201cproposition about\nSocrates\u201d was true or false. It is true, perhaps, of\nSocrates\\(_1\\), and not of Socrates\\(_2\\). It is neither true nor\nfalse of Socrates simpliciter, for, it turns out, there is no\nsuch person. (Strawson 1959: 191\u2013192)\n\n\nSearle (1958) responds to the epistemic argument (see\n Section 2.3)\n by proposing a cluster theory. That argument seemed to show that\nindividual components of the cluster, such as taught Plato,\ncould not be necessary conditions on belonging to the name\u2019s\nextension. For otherwise it would be knowable a priori that\nSocrates taught Plato. (Note that there is a similar problem with\ntreating it as a sufficient condition; for then it would be a\npriori that no-one other than Socrates taught Plato.) Instead,\nSearle suggests that a name\u2019s meaning imposes the weaker\nrequirement that some member of the cluster be true of the\nreferent. On his account, it is only a priori that the\nreferent possesses the disjunction of the conditions of the\ncluster. (Note that this weak condition is unlikely to single out a\nreferent for the name; hence Searle does not seem to provide a\ncomplete picture of reference determination. But strengthening the\naccount would only make the a priori consequences\nstronger.)\n\nSearle\u2019s escape route is blocked if one can show that, for any\nfinite list of the relevant sort (and for persons fully knowledgeable\nof the name\u2019s meaning\u2014see\n Section 2.3),\n it is conceivable that the true referent satisfies none of the\nconditions on the list. If clusters are finite lists of conditions,\nthen the theory predicts that there is some such list for which it is\na priori that the referent satisfies at least one of its\nconditions.\n\nOne way of so arguing would be to cultivate the intuition that any\nfinite list must be incomplete. Given any list, there is a conceivable\nscenario in which some further property\u2014one that was left off\nthe list\u2014proves crucial in determining the name\u2019s\nreference. This kind of argument was used by Friedrich Waismann (1945)\nto demonstrate the \u201copen texture\u201d of empirical predicates,\nsuch as \u201cgold\u201d and \u201ccat\u201d. But it seems that\nthe list of factors that could conceivably be relevant to determining\nthe referent of \u201cSocrates\u201d is similarly open ended. If\nthis hunch is correct, then the best we could hope for from a finite\ncluster theory is a kind of ceteris paribus determination:\n\n\n\nIf such-and-such facts obtain and no other facts relevant to the\ndetermination of the reference of \u201cSocrates\u201d, then\n\u201cSocrates\u201d refers to so-and-so.\n\n\nKripke (1980: 66\u201367) argues that, so long as our cluster\nconsists only of properties commonly attributed to the bearer of the\nname, as on Strawson\u2019s account, it is conceivable that none of\nits members applies to the referent. His case is buoyed by examples\nwhere experts posit or even identify a historical figure behind a\npopular legend, and treat the historical personage, who might share\nnone of the attributes of the legendary one, as the true referent of\nthe name. We might respond by applying Strawson\u2019s method to the\ncommunity of experts, rather than the general populace where the\nlegend holds sway, as it would then succeed in picking out the\nhistorical figure. However, the general observation is that no group\nis incorrigible. Even those experts could turn out, it seems, to be\nwholly wrong in their descriptions of the name\u2019s referent (as\nrevealed, perhaps, by a new wave of experts).\n\nKripke thus provides a direct challenge to a cluster theory based on\nidentifying descriptions. A complication is that Strawson explicitly\ncountenances identifying descriptions that are parasitic on other\nspeakers\u2019 use (such as the individual Plato referred to as\n\u201cSocrates\u201d). Kripke attempts to repulse this\nmaneuver, noting that the reference of one\u2019s own utterance of a\nname is ultimately determined by the reference of the person from whom\none in fact learned the name, rather than the person one might\nmistakenly identify as such (1980: 90\u201391; see also Geach 1969:\n288\u2013289; and Donnellan 1970).\n\nSuppose we could craft a version of the cluster theory that was\nmaterially correct (it satisfies all of our intuitions about the\nreference of the name in different eventualities). We might\nlegitimately ask, as we have done before, whether this theory succeeds\nin giving the meaning of the name. It seems that many have favored\nthis conclusion chiefly for want of an alternative: if a cluster of\ncommonly attributed features is not the meaning of a name, then what\nis? Or if, alternatively, names don\u2019t have meanings, then what\ncould it be that determines their extension? We will supply one\ngeneral answer to the second of these questions in the next\nsection.\n",
