    "main_text": "Life and Writings\n1. Life and Writings\n\nThe dramatic occasion of Plato\u2019s dialogue, Parmenides,\nis a fictionalized visit to Athens by the eminent Parmenides and his\nyounger associate, Zeno, to attend the festival of the Great\nPanathenaea. Plato describes Parmenides as about sixty-five years old\nand Socrates, with whom he converses in the first part of the\ndialogue, as \u201cquite young then,\u201d which is normally taken\nto mean about twenty. Given that Socrates was a little past seventy\nwhen executed by the Athenians in 399 BCE, one can infer from this\ndescription that Parmenides was born about 515 BCE. He would thus\nappear to have been active during the early to mid-fifth century BCE.\nSpeusippus, Plato\u2019s successor as head of the Academy, is said to\nhave reported in his On Philosophers that Parmenides\nestablished the laws for the citizens of his native Elea, one of the\nGreek colonies along southern Italy\u2019s Tyrrhenian coast (Speus.\nfr. 3 Tar\u00e1n ap. D.L. 9.23; cf. Plu. Col.\n1126A), though Elea was founded some 30 years before Parmenides\u2019\nbirth. The ancient historiographic tradition naturally associates\nParmenides with thinkers such as Xenophanes and the Pythagoreans\nactive in Magna Graecia, the Greek-speaking regions of southern Italy,\nwhom he may well have encountered. A 1st c. CE portrait head of\nParmenides was discovered at Castellamare della Bruca (ancient Elea)\nin the 1960s with an inscription\u2014\u201cParmeneides, son of\nPyres, Ouliad\u00eas, Natural Philosopher\u201d\u2014that\nassociates him with a cult of Apollo Oulios or Apollo the Healer.\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Parmenides composed only a single work\n(D.L. 1.16). This was a metaphysical and cosmological poem in the\ntraditional epic medium of hexameter verse. The title \u201cOn\nNature\u201d under which it was transmitted is probably not\nauthentic. The poem originally extended to perhaps eight hundred\nverses, roughly one hundred and sixty of which have survived as\n\u201cfragments\u201d that vary in length from a single word (fr.\n15a: \u201cwater-rooted,\u201d describing the earth) to the\nsixty-two verses of fragment 8. That any portion of his poem survives\nis due entirely to the fact that later ancient authors, beginning with\nPlato, for one reason or another felt the need to quote some portion\nof it in the course of their own writings. Sextus Empiricus quotes\nthirty of the thirty-two verses of fragment 1 (the opening Proem of\nthe poem), though apparently from some sort of Hellenistic digest\nrather than from an actual manuscript copy, for his quotation of fr.\n1.1\u201330 continues uninterruptedly with five and a half verses\nfrom fragments 7 and 8. The Alexandrian Neoplatonist Simplicius (6th\nc. CE) appears to have possessed a good copy of the work, from which\nhe quoted extensively in his commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics and De Caelo. He introduces his lengthy\nquotation of fr. 8.1\u201352 as follows: \u201cEven if one might\nthink it pedantic, I would gladly transcribe in this commentary the\nverses of Parmenides on the one being, which aren\u2019t numerous,\nboth as evidence for what I have said and because of the scarcity of\nParmenides\u2019 treatise.\u201d Thanks to Simplicius\u2019 lengthy\ntranscription, we appear to have the entirety of Parmenides\u2019\nmajor metaphysical argument demonstrating the attributes of\n\u201cWhat Is\u201d (to eon) or \u201ctrue reality\u201d\n(al\u00eatheia).\n\nWe are much less well informed about the cosmology Parmenides\nexpounded in the latter part of the poem and so must supplement the\nprimary evidence of the fragments with testimonia, that is,\nwith various reports or paraphrases of his theories that we also find\nin later authors. (A number of these testimonia are collected\namong the fifty-four \u201cA-Fragmente\u201d in the Parmenides\nsection of Diels and Kranz\u2019s Die Fragmente der\nVorsokratiker. A more comprehensive collection of\ntestimonia, with English translations, is to be found in\nCoxon 2009, 99\u2013267. Many of these testimonia are\npresented and translated together with the verbatim fragments in the\nD section of Laks and Most 2016.) As always when dealing with\nan ancient philosopher whose work has not survived entire, one must\ntake into account how the philosophical and other concerns of later\nauthors thanks to whom we know what we do of Parmenides\u2019\noriginal poem are likely to have shaped the transmission of the extant\nfragments and testimonia. Certainly the partial and imperfect\npreservation of his poem is one factor that complicates understanding\nof his thought.\n",
