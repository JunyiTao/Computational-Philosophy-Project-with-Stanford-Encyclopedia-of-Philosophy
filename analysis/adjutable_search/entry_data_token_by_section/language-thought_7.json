    "main_text": "Arguments for LOTH || Argument from Cognitive Science Practice\n4.1 Argument from Cognitive Science Practice\n\nFodor (1975) defends RTT+COMP+CCTM by appealing to scientific\npractice: our best cognitive science postulates Turing-style mental\ncomputations over Mentalese expressions; therefore, we should accept\nthat mental computation operates over Mentalese expressions. Fodor\ndevelops his argument by examining detailed case studies, including\nperception, decision-making, and linguistic comprehension. He argues\nthat, in each case, computation over mental representations plays a\ncentral explanatory role. Fodor\u2019s argument was widely heralded\nas a compelling analysis of then-current cognitive science. The\nargument from cognitive science practice has subsequently been\ndeveloped and updated both by Fodor and by other authors, such as\nQuilty-Dunn, Porot, and Mandelbaum (forthcoming).\n\nWhen evaluating cognitive science support for LOTH, it is crucial to\nspecify what version of LOTH one has in mind. Specifically,\nestablishing that certain mental processes operate over mental\nrepresentations is not enough to establish RTT. For example, one might\naccept that mental representations figure in perception and animal\nnavigation but not in high-level human cognition. Gallistel and King\n(2009) defend COMP+CCTM+FSC through a number of (mainly non-human)\nempirical case studies, but they do not endorse RTT. They focus on\nrelatively low-level phenomena, such as animal navigation, without\ndiscussing human decision-making, deductive inference, problem\nsolving, or other high-level cognitive phenomena.\n",
