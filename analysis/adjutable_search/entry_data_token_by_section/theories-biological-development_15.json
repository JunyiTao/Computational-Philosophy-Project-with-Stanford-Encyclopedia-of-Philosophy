Twenty-First-Century Alternatives: A New Epigenesis?\n\nThe end of the twentieth century brought discoveries that challenged\nprevailing genetic determinism, and also began to replace the extreme\nforms of either preformationism or epigenesis with the sorts of\ninteractionist models that were only offered as outlying alternatives\nin earlier decades. A modified form of epigenesis, in which the\norganism is seen as beginning from an inherited egg and sperm that do\ninclude genes, seems to be on the rise again. Research on cell\ndevelopment, stem cells, and tissue engineering shows that the\nidentity of any particular cell is not predetermined, but also depends\non interactions with its neighbors and context. Ian Wilmut\u2019s\nteam\u2019s success in cloning Dolly, reported in 1997, and John\nGearhart and James Thomson\u2019s successes with developing human\nstem cell lines, both reported in 1998, challenged prevailing\nassumptions (Wilmut et al 1997, Wilmut, Campbell, & Tudge 2000;\nThomson et al. 1998; Shamblott et al. 1998; Gearhart 1998). Both\nsuggested that development is a good deal more flexible, plastic, and\ninteractive than preformationist interpretations allow. These\nexperimental results, alongside conceptual issues, spur alternative\ntheories of development. Gilbert (2004) notes increased emphasis on\ninteraction, change, emergence, and reciprocal\n\u201cdetermination\u201d relations between whole and component\nparts. His own work emphasizes the need for multiple perspectives in\nunderstanding development; notably diversification in the location of\ncausal control beyond genes alone (see the entry on\n evolution and development).\n This section focuses on philosophical efforts along these lines.\n",
