    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe locus classicus of game formalism is not a defence of the\nposition by a convinced advocate, but a demolition job by a great\nphilosopher, Gottlob Frege. Not that he was attacking a straw man\nposition: the highly influential diatribe by Frege in volume II of his\nGrundgesetze Der Arithmetik (Frege, 1903) is an attack on the\nwork of two real mathematicians, H. E. Heine and Johannes Thomae.\nMoreover, philosophers of mathematics are wont to claim that the\nposition is still widely adopted by mathematicians. It must be\nemphasised, however, that \u201cformalism\u201d in this\nsense\u2014the Heine/Thomae position as interpreted by Frege, and its\ndescendants\u2014is to be distinguished from a more sophisticated\nposition (it is claimed), namely Hilbertian formalism. For more\ninformation on the latter see Detlefsen (1993) or consult the entries\non\n Hilbert\u2019s program\n and\n the Frege-Hilbert controversy.)\n Detlefsen (2005) also provides a detailed historical treatment of\nformalist themes in thinkers from the ancient Greeks up to the period\nof Frege and Hilbert and beyond which is the focus here. \n\nAlthough it is the non-Hilbertian approach we will be concerned with\nin this entry, we briefly discuss the Hilbertian approach. The\nHilbertian position differs because it depends on a distinction within\nmathematical language between a finitary sector, whose\nsentences express contentful propositions, and an ideal, or\ninfinitary sector. Where exactly Hilbert drew the\ndistinction, or where it should be drawn, is a matter of debate.\nCrucially, though, Hilbert adopted an instrumentalistic attitude\ntowards the ideal sector. The formulae of this language are, or are\ntreated as if they are, uninterpreted, having the syntactic form of\nsentences to which we can apply formal rules of transformation and\ninference but no semantics. Nonetheless they are, or can be useful, if\nthe ideal sector conservatively extends the finitary, that is if no\nproof from finitary premisses to a finitary conclusion which takes a\ndetour through the infinitary language yields a conclusion we could\nnot have reached, albeit perhaps (herein lies the utility) by a\nlonger, more unwieldy proof. The goal of the Hilbert programme was to\nprovide a finitary proof of this conservative extension result; most,\nthough not all, think this goal was proved impossible by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem.\n\nReturning now to our non-Hilbertian focus, the earlier formalism which\nFrege attacked does not divide mathematics into the aforementioned\ndual categories of the finitary/contentful, and the\ninfinitary/essentially meaningless but, on the contrary, treats all of\nmathematics in a unitary and homogeneous fashion. From now on I will\nuse \u2018formalism\u2019, to refer to the non-Hilbertian positions\nand will start with an account of the formalist views distilled by\nFrege from Heine and Thomae and the criticisms he made of them. These\ncriticisms are widely believed now to contain conclusive refutations\nof the Heine/Thomae approach. But there are a number of post-Fregean\nviews which seem heavily influenced by, or strongly analogous to,\nformalism. I will go through these in turn:\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s views on mathematics, primarily the\nconception to be found in his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus;\nformalism as found in the Logical Positivists, particularly\nCarnap;\nGoodman and Quine\u2019s nominalist formalism;\nHaskell Curry\u2019s version of formalism and \nformalist interpretations of the Curry-Howard correspondence.\n\n\nI will conclude with a look at more recent formalist philosophers and\nan overall assessment of the prospects for formalism in contemporary\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n",
