    "main_text": "Imagination, Politics, Allegory || Allegory and Obscure Writing: External Layers vs. True Ideas\n7.3 Dynamic Writing\n\n\nMoving from Maimonides' allegorical rendering of the Bible, we might\nnote too his use of a dynamic of external and internal senses in the\nvery construction of his own treatise, a dynamism which can be seen\nearlier in an even more emphatic form in Avicenna's own elaborate\n\u201cvisionary recitals \u201d (see Corbin 1960).  Seen in\nMaimonides own construction of parables (see Guide 3.51 for the\nparable of the palace), in his use of metaphors, in his allegorical\nrenderings of Biblical verses, but also more broadly in the overall\nconstruction of the Guide (in his leaving lots of ambiguities and in\nhis giving voice to outright contradictions), the creative spirit of\n\u201cinner vs. outer\u201d reading and writing strategies is part\nof what makes it so difficult to interpret Maimonides on such\nimportant topics as creation, providence, and immortality. In fact,\nMaimonides prefaces his Guide with a list of seven reasons for\n\u201ccontradictory or contrary statements\u201d (G Intro, P 17) in\nbooks, together with the overt declaration that the Guide itself will\ncontain \u201cdivergencies\u201d which may be explained in light of\nthe list.  Reflecting on the writing dynamics at play in his own text,\nMaimonides explains:\n\n\nDivergences that are to be found in this Treatise are due to the fifth\ncause and the seventh. Know this, grasp its true meaning, and remember\nit very well so as not to become perplexed by some of its chapters. (G\nIntro, P 17)\n\n\n\n\nThe fifth cause of contradictory writing is related by Maimonides to\n\u201cthe necessity of teaching and making someone understand\u201d\n(G Intro, P 17-18), whereas the seventh is related to the necessity of\n\u201cconceal[ing] some parts\u201d and \u201cdisclos[ing]\nothers\u201d when it comes to treating \u201cvery obscure matters\n\u201d (G Intro, P 17).  And while he does not cite the third cause\nas one of his own strategies of writing, he does cite it as a\nprinciple at play in the prophetic Scriptures; returning us again to\nthe idea of \u201cexternal\u201d vs. \u201cinternal\u201d senses,\nthis is the case in which,\n\n\n[n]ot all the statements in question are to be taken in their external\nsense; some are to be taken in their external sense, while some others\nare parables and hence have an inner content\u2026 (G Intro, P 17)\n\n\n\nStarting off his treatise as he does with attention to the dynamics of\ninternal and external meanings (seen too in his reflections on the\ngolden apples and silver casings of Proverbs 25:11), Maimonides\nclearly illustrates his sensitivity to the importance and pedagogical\neffectiveness of various writing and speaking strategies in which\nmeanings are hidden, surface senses meet inner senses, and\nexpression-via-contradiction is an art form.\n\n\nEvidence of shared ideas between Maimonides and Islamic philosophers\non these themes abounds. As is clear from even the representative\nquotes from Islamic sources cited throughout, these interrelated\nfeatures of imagination, allegory, politics, and religion in\nMaimonides' thought are hallmarks of the political philosophical\nwritings of al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Averroes as well. Here, as\nthroughout our investigation, understanding the Islamic philosophical\ncontext of the Guide is key for understanding the intricacies of\nMaimonides' thought.\n",
