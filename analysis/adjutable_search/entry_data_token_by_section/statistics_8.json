    "main_text": "Bayesian statistics\n4. Bayesian statistics\nBayesian statistical methods are often presented in the form of an\ninference. The inference runs from a so-called prior\nprobability distribution over statistical hypotheses, which expresses\nthe degree of belief in the hypotheses before data has been collected,\nto a posterior probability distribution over the\nhypotheses, which expresses the beliefs after the data have been\nincorporated. The posterior distribution follows, via the axioms of\nprobability theory, from the prior distribution and the\nlikelihoods of the hypotheses for the data obtained, i.e.,\nthe probability that the hypotheses assign to the data. Bayesian\nmethods thus employ data to modulate our attitude towards\na designated set of statistical hypotheses, and in this respect\nthey achieve the same as classical statistical procedures. Both types\nof statistics present a response to the problem of induction. But\nwhereas classical procedures select or eliminate elements from the set\nof hypotheses, Bayesian methods express the impact of data in a\nposterior probability assignment over the set. This posterior is fully\ndetermined by the prior and the likelihoods of the hypotheses, via the\nformalism of probability theory.\nThe defining characteristic of Bayesian statistics is that it\nconsiders probability distributions over statistical hypotheses as\nwell as over data. It embraces the epistemic interpretation of\nprobability whole-heartedly: probabilities over hypotheses are\ninterpreted as degrees of belief, i.e., as expressions of epistemic\nuncertainty. The philosophy of Bayesian statistics is concerned\nwith determining the appropriate interpretation of these input\ncomponents, and of the mathematical formalism of probability itself,\nultimately with the aim to justify the output. Notice that the general\npattern of a Bayesian statistical method is that of\ninductivism in the cumulative sense: under the impact of\ndata we move to more and more informed probabilistic opinions about\nthe hypotheses. However, in the following it will appear that Bayesian\nmethods may also be understood as deductivist in nature.\n",
