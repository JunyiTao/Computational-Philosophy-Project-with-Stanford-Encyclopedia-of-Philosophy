    "main_text": "\n\n\nAssociated with postmodern and poststructuralist theory, Jean\nBaudrillard (1929\u20132007) is difficult to situate in relation to\ntraditional and contemporary philosophy. His work combines philosophy,\nsocial theory, and an idiosyncratic cultural metaphysics that reflects\non key events and phenomena of the epoch. A sharp critic of\ncontemporary society, culture, and thought, Baudrillard is often seen\nas a major guru of French postmodern theory, although he can also be\nread as a thinker who combines social and cultural criticism in\noriginal and provocative ways and a writer who has developed his own\nstyle and forms of writing. He was an extremely prolific author who has\npublished over fifty books and commented on some of the most salient\ncultural and sociological phenomena of the contemporary era, including\nthe erasure of the distinctions of gender, race, and class that\nstructured modern societies in a new postmodern consumer, media, and\nhigh tech society; the mutating roles of art and aesthetics;\nfundamental changes in politics, culture, and human beings; and the\nimpact of new media, information, and cybernetic technologies in the\ncreation of a qualitatively different social order, providing\nfundamental mutations of human and social life.\n\n\nFor some years a cult figure of postmodern theory, Baudrillard moved\nbeyond the postmodern discourse from the early 1980s to his death in\n2007, and in his later writings developed a highly idiosyncratic mode\nof philosophical and cultural analysis. This entry focuses on the\ndevelopment of Baudrillard\u2019s unique modes of thought and how he\nmoved from social theory to postmodern theory to a provocative type of\nphilosophical\n analysis.[1]\nIn\nretrospect, Baudrillard can be seen a theorist who has traced in\noriginal ways the life of signs and impact of technology on social\nlife, and who has systematically criticized major modes of modern\nthought, while developing his own philosophical perspectives.\n",
