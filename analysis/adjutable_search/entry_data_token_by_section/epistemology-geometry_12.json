    "main_text": "The intelligibility of the new geometries\n6. The intelligibility of the new geometries\n\nThe epistemological significance of projective geometry rests on its\nimplications for the nature and rigour of classical geometry. The\nepistemological significance of non-Euclidean geometry rests more on\nthe possibility that it could be true in whatever way that Euclidean\ngeometry could be true. We therefore turn to 19th century\nexaminations of the intelligibility of geometry.\n\nBut first a word of warning. The logical fact that non-Euclidean\ngeometry turned out to be consistent (relative to Euclidean geometry,\nor to real analysis) does not per se establish the invalidity of the\nKantian viewpoint. Kant's views are compatible with the existence of\nlogical alternatives to Euclidean geometry; after all, he was arguing\nabout space as an intuition, not about mere conceptual possibilities;\nhe was not a Leibnizian, and denied that geometry is analytic. If\nanything, a Kantian would expect that the alternative geometries are\nonly an intellectual possibility, and that we cannot visualize them\nintuitively. A sophisticated elaboration of such a standpoint was\nFrege's in his famous correspondence with Hilbert (see the entry on the\n Frege-Hilbert controversy).\n But it's true that most of the relevant authors chose a different\nline of thought and abandoned the Kantian position.\n",
