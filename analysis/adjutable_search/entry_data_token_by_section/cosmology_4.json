Cosmology clearly relies very heavily on theory; the\ncosmological parameters that have been the target of observational\ncampaigns are only defined given a background model. The strongest\ncase for accepting the SM rests on the evidence in favor of the\nunderlying physics, in concert with the overdetermination of\ncosmological parameters. The SM includes several free parameters, such\nas the density parameters characterizing the abundance of different\ntypes of matter, each of which can be measured several\n ways.[14]\n These methods have distinctive theoretical assumptions and sources of\nerror. For example, the abundance of deuterium produced during big\nbang nucleosynthesis depends sensitively on the baryon density.\nNucleosynthesis is described using well-tested nuclear physics, and\nthe light element abundances are frozen in within the \u201cfirst\nthree minutes\u201d. The amplitudes of the acoustic peaks in the CMB\nangular power spectrum depend on the baryon density at the time of\ndecoupling. Current measurements fix the baryon density to an accuracy\nof one percent, and the values determined by these two methods agree\nwithin observational error. This agreement is one of many consistency\nchecks for the\n SM.[15]\n There are important discrepancies, such as that between local versus\nglobal measurements of the Hubble parameter \\(H_0\\) (Lukovi\u0107 et\nal. 2016; Bernal et al. 2016). The significance and further\nimplications of these discrepancies is not clear.\n\nThe SM from nucleosynthesis on can be regarded as well supported by\nmany lines of evidence. The independence and diversity of the\nmeasurements provides some assurance that the SM will not be\nundermined by isolated theoretical mistakes or undetected sources of\nsystematic error. But the SM is far from complete, and there are three\ndifferent types of significant open issues.\n\nFirst, we do not understand three crucial components of the SM that\nrequire new physics. We do not have a full account of the nature, or\nunderlying dynamics, of dark matter (Bertone et al. 2005), dark energy\n(Peebles & Ratra 2003), or the inflaton field (Lyth & Riotto\n1999; Martin et al. 2014). These are well-recognized problems that\nhave inspired active theoretical and observational work, although as\nwe note below in\n \u00a72.4\n they will be challenging to resolve due to inaccessibility of physics\nat the appropriate scale.\n\nThe second set of open questions regards structure formation. While\nthe account of structure formation matches several significant\nobserved features, such as the correlations among galaxies in large\nscale surveys, there are a number of open questions about how galaxies\nform (Silk 2017). Many of these, such as the cusp-core problem\n(Weinberg et al. 2015), and the dark halos problem (a great many more\nsmall dark halos are predicted around galaxies than observed) regard\nfeatures of galaxies on relatively small scales, which require\ndetailed modeling of a variety of astrophysical processes over an\nenormous dynamical range. This is also a very active area of research,\ndriven in particular by a variety of new lines of observational\nresearch and large-scale numerical simulations.\n\nThe third and final set of open issues regards possible observations\nthat would show that the SM is substantially wrong. Any scientific\ntheory should be incompatible with at least some observations, and\nthat is the case for the SM. In the early days of relativistic\ncosmology, the universe was judged to be younger than some stars or\nglobular clusters. This conflict arose due to a mistaken value of the\nHubble constant. There is currently no such age problem for the SM,\nbut obviously discovering an object older than 13.7 Gyr would force a\nmajor re-evaluation of current cosmological models. Another example\nwould be if there was not a dipole in matter number counts that agrees\nwith the CMB dipole (Ellis & Baldwin 1984).\n",
