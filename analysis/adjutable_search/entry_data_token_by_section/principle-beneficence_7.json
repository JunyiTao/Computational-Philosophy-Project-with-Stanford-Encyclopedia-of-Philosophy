    "main_text": "Liberty-Limiting Beneficence: The Problem of Benefit Paternalism\n5. Liberty-Limiting Beneficence: The Problem of Benefit Paternalism\n\n\nA much-discussed issue about beneficence descends historically from\nMill\u2019s On Liberty, where Mill inquired into the nature and\nlimits of justifiable social control over the individual. He argues\nthat the measure of a person\u2019s liberty\u2014or personal\nautonomy\u2014is the measure of the person\u2019s independence from\ninfluences that control the person\u2019s preferences, thoughts, and\nbehavior. Various principles commonly assumed to be moral\nprinciples have been advanced to justify the limitation of individual\nliberties. Joel Feinberg, who was philosophically close to various of\nMill\u2019s views, appropriately called these principles\n\u201cliberty-limiting principles.\u201d Mill defended the view that\nonly one principle validly limits liberty. Feinberg called it the\nharm principle: A person\u2019s liberty (or autonomy) is justifiably\nrestricted to prevent harm to others caused by that person. Feinberg\nagreed with Mill that the principle of paternalism, which\nrenders acceptable certain acts intended to benefit another person when\nthe other does not prefer to receive the benefit, is not a morally\nacceptable liberty-limiting principle.\n\n\nThe term paternalism has its roots in the notion of\npaternal administration\u2014government as by a father to administer\nin the way a beneficent father raises his children. The analogy with\nthe father presupposes two features of the paternal role: that the\nfather acts beneficently (that is, in accordance with the interests of\nhis children) and that he makes all or at least some of the decisions\nrelating to his children\u2019s welfare, rather than leaving them free to\nmake those decisions. On this model, \u201cpaternalism\u201d may be\ndefined as the intentional overriding of one person\u2019s known preferences\nor choices by another person, where the person who overrides justifies\nthe action by the goal of substantially benefiting or avoiding harm to\nthe person whose preferences or choices are overridden. (Both\n\u201cbenefiting\u201d and \u201cavoiding harm\u201d can generally,\nthough not always, be understood as forms of beneficence.) An act of\npaternalism, then, overrides moral obligations to respect autonomous\nchoice on grounds of beneficence.\n\n\nPhilosophers divide sharply over whether some restricted form of\npaternalism can be justified and, if so, on what basis. One plausible\nbeneficence-based justification of paternalistic actions places\nbenefits on a scale with autonomy interests and balances the two: As a\nperson\u2019s interests in autonomy increase and the benefits for that\nperson decrease, the justification of paternalistic action becomes less\ncogent; conversely, as the benefits for a person increase and that\nperson\u2019s interests in autonomy decrease, the justification of\npaternalistic action becomes more plausible. In this account preventing\nminor harms or providing minor benefits while deeply disrespecting\nautonomy lacks plausible justification; but actions that prevent major\nharms or provide major benefits while only trivially disrespecting\nautonomy have a plausible paternalistic rationale.\n\n\nThough no consensus exists over the justification of paternalism,\nvirtually no one thinks that benefit paternalism can be justified\nunless at least the following conditions are\nsatisfied:\n\nA person is at risk of a substantial and preventable harm or loss\nof a benefit.\nThe paternalistic action has a strong likelihood of preventing the\nharm or obtaining the benefit.\nThe projected benefits of the paternalistic action outweigh its\nrisks.\nThe least autonomy-restrictive alternative that will secure the\nbenefits or reduce the risks is implemented.\n\n\n\nDebates about benefit paternalism have also emerged in public policy\ncontexts. Often health policies have the goal of avoiding a harm or\nproviding a benefit in a population in which most affected parties are\nnot consulted. Some percentage of the population will not support the\npolicy because they are given no choice in the matter, whereas others\nwill approve the policy. In effect, the policy is intended to benefit\nall members of a population without consulting the specific preferences\nof the individuals affected\u2014all the while foreseeing that many\nindividuals will in fact reject the imposed control that the policy\nexerts over their lives.\n\n\nSo-called libertarian paternalists (or neopaternalists), principally\nthe team of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, have argued for\ngovernment and other institutional policies intended to protect or\nbenefit individuals through shaping, steering, or nudging their choices\nwithout altogether disallowing or coercing those choices. These writers\nrecommend policies developed by public and private institutions to\n\u201cnudge\u201d people to the advancement of their welfare without\ncoercively making them to do so, while purportedly preserving their\nautonomy. These policies pursue values that an intended beneficiary\nallegedly already holds, at least implicitly, but does not realize\nbecause of limited capacities, limited resources, or limited\nself-control. Here the individual\u2019s own stated preferences,\nchoices, or actions are deemed unreasonable in light of other\nvalues the person is believed to embrace. Since they already embrace\nthese values, their autonomy is not violated despite the paternalism at\nwork.\n\n\nThis conception must confront two major problems: The first is\nconceptual. It is head-scratching how a libertarian can be a\npaternalist in the standard senses of these terms. Genuine libertarians\nfirmly support freedom of choice, freedom of contract, and the like,\nwhich seems to lack any firm support in \u201clibertarian\npaternalism.\u201d Second, what an informed and competent person\nchooses to do generally supplies the evidence of his or her true\nvalues, not some hidden value that contradicts what they choose. For\nexample, if a politically conservative man fails in one election to\nsupport the platform of a party whose platform he has always wholly\nsupported and has often said he will always support, he seems in some\nrespect committed to his party\u2019s platform, but his departure from\nthe platform in this case seems to be the best evidence we have of his\ntrue values now on the particular matter of which political positions\nhe supports. It would be improper to assert that he supports the\ncurrent platform of the party he has always supported in the past.\nSimilarly, a justified paternalism must have adequate evidence of any\nassumption it makes about an individual\u2019s deepest beliefs or\nhopes and whether they are misguided in any given case.\n",
