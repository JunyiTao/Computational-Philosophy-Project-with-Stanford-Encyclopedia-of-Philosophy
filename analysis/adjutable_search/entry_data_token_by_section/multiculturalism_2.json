    "main_text": "Justifications for multiculturalism || Equality\n2.2 Equality\n\nA second justification for multiculturalism comes from within\nliberalism but a liberalism that has been revised through critical\nengagement with the communitarian critique of liberalism. Will\nKymlicka has developed the most influential liberal theory of\nmulticulturalism by marrying the liberal values of autonomy and\nequality with an argument about the value of cultural membership\n(1989, 1995, 2001). Rather than beginning with intrinsically valuable\ncollective goals and goods as Taylor does, Kymlicka views cultures as\ninstrumentally valuable to individuals, for two main reasons. First,\ncultural membership is an important condition of personal autonomy. In\nhis first book, Liberalism, Community, and Culture (1989),\nKymlicka develops his case for multiculturalism within a Rawlsian\nframework of justice, viewing cultural membership as a \u201cprimary\ngood,\u201d things that every rational person is presumed to want and\nwhich are necessary for the pursuit of one\u2019s goals (Rawls 1971, 62).\nIn his later book, Multicultural Citizenship (1995), Kymlicka\ndrops the Rawlsian scaffolding, relying instead on the work of Avishai\nMargalit and Joseph Raz on national self-determination (1990). One\nimportant condition of autonomy is having an adequate range of options\nfrom which to choose (Raz 1986). Cultures serve as \u201ccontexts of\nchoice,\u201d which provide meaningful options and scripts with which\npeople can frame, revise, and pursue their goals (Kymlicka 1995, 89).\nSecond, cultural membership plays an important role in people\u2019s\nself-identity. Citing Margalit and Raz as well as Taylor, Kymlicka\nviews cultural identity as providing people with an \u201canchor for\ntheir self-identification and the safety of effortless secure\nbelonging\u201d (1995, 89, quoting Margalit and Raz 1990, 448 and\nalso citing Taylor 1992). This means there is a deep and general\nconnection between a person\u2019s self-respect and the respect accorded to\nthe cultural group of which she is a part. It is not simply membership\nin any culture but one\u2019s own culture that must be secured in\norder for cultural membership to serve as a meaningful context of\nchoice and a basis of self-respect.\n\nKymlicka moves from these premises about the instrumental value of\ncultural membership to the egalitarian claim that because members of\nminority groups are disadvantaged in terms of access to their own\ncultures (in contrast to members of the majority culture), they are\nentitled to special protections. It is important to note that\nKymlicka\u2019s egalitarian argument for multiculturalism rests on a theory\nof equality that critics have dubbed \u201cluck egalitarianism\u201d\n(Anderson 1999, Scheffler 2003). According to luck egalitarians,\nindividuals should be held responsible for inequalities resulting from\ntheir own choices, but not for inequalities deriving from unchosen\ncircumstances (Dworkin 1981; Rakowski 1993). The latter inequalities\nare the collective responsibility of citizens to address. For example,\ninequalities stemming from one\u2019s social starting position in life are\nunchosen yet so strongly determine our prospects in life. Luck\negalitarians argue that those born into poor families are entitled to\ncollective support and assistance via a redistributive tax scheme.\nKymlicka adds cultural membership to this list of unchosen\ninequalities. If one is born into the dominant culture of society, one\nenjoys good brute luck, whereas those who belong to minority cultures\nsuffer disadvantages in virtue of the bad brute luck of their minority\nstatus. Insofar as inequality in access to cultural membership stems\nfrom luck (as opposed to individual choices) and one suffers\ndisadvantages as a result of it, members of minority groups can\nreasonably demand that members of the majority culture must share in\nbearing the costs of accommodation. Minority group rights are\njustified, as Kymlicka argues, \u201cwithin a liberal egalitarian\ntheory\u2026which emphasizes the importance of rectifying unchosen\ninequalities\u201d (Kymlicka 1995, 109).\n\nOne might question whether cultural minority groups really are\n\u201cdisadvantaged\u201d and thereby, owed positive accommodations.\nWhy not just enforce antidiscrimination laws, stopping short of any\npositive accommodations for minority groups? Kymlicka and other\nliberal theorists of multiculturalism contend that antidiscrimination\nlaws fall short of treating members of minority groups as equals; this\nis because states cannot be neutral with respect to culture. In\nculturally diverse societies, we can easily find patterns of state\nsupport for some cultural groups over others. While states\nmay prohibit racial discrimination and avoid official establishment of\nany religion, they cannot avoid establishing one language for public\nschooling and other state services (language being a paradigmatic\nmarker of culture) (Kymlicka 1995, 111; Carens 2000, 77\u201378;\nPatten 2001, 693). Linguistic advantage translates into economic and\npolitical advantage since members of the dominant cultural community\nhave a leg up in schools, the workplace, and politics. Linguistic\nadvantage also takes a symbolic form. When state action extends\nsymbolic affirmation to some groups and not others by adopting a\nparticular language or by organizing the work week and public holidays\naround the calendar of particular religions, it has a normalizing\neffect, suggesting that one group\u2019s language and customs are more\nvalued than those of other groups.\n\nIn addition to state support of certain cultures over others, state\nlaws may place constraints on some cultural groups over\nothers. Consider the case of dress code regulations in public schools\nor the workplace. A ban on religious dress burdens religious\nindividuals, as in the case of Simcha Goldman, a U.S. Air Force\nofficer, who was also an ordained rabbi and wished to wear a yarmulke\nout of respect to an omnipresent God (Goldman v. Weinberger,\n475 US 503 (1986)). The case of the French state\u2019s ban on religious\ndress in public schools, which burdens Muslim girls who wish to wear\nheadscarves to school, is another example (Bowen 2007, Laborde 2008).\nReligion may command that believers dress in a certain way (what Peter\nJones calls an \u201cintrinsic burden\u201d), not that believers\nrefrain from attending school or going to work (Jones 1994). Yet,\nburdens on believers do not stem from the dictates of religion alone;\nthey also arise from the intersection of the demands of religion and\nthe demands of the state (\u201cextrinsic burden\u201d). Individuals\nmust bear intrinsic burdens themselves; bearing the burdens of the\ndictates of one\u2019s faith, such as prayer, worship, and fasting, just is\npart of meeting one\u2019s religious obligations. When it comes to\nextrinsic burdens, however, liberal multiculturalists argue that\njustice requires assisting cultural minorities bear the burdens of\nthese unchosen disadvantages.\n\nIt is important to note that liberal multiculturalists distinguish\namong different types of groups. For instance, Kymlicka\u2019s theory\ndevelops a typology of different groups and different types of rights\nfor each. It offers the strongest form of group-differentiated\nrights\u2014self-government rights\u2014to indigenous peoples and\nnational minorities for the luck egalitarian reason that their\nminority status is unchosen: they were coercively incorporated into\nthe larger state. By contrast, immigrants are viewed as\nvoluntary migrants: by choosing to migrate, they relinquished\naccess to their native culture. Immigrant multiculturalism, what\nKymlicka calls \u201cpolyethnic rights\u201d, is understood as a\ndemand for fairer terms of integration into the broader society\nthrough the granting of exemptions and accommodations, not a rejection\nof integration or a demand for collective self-determination (1995,\n113\u2013115).\n",
