    "main_text": "Term Formalism: Curry\n6. Term Formalism: Curry\n\nThe most substantive attempt at a non-Hilbertian formalist philosophy\nof mathematics is Haskell Curry\u2019s book Outline of a\nFormalist Philosophy of Mathematics (Curry, 1951). Curry is no\ngame formalist, his position is closer to term formalism, of the two\nviews we started out from. Curry\u2019s philosophy of mathematics,\nhowever, is, or attempts to be, a highly anti-metaphysical one, at\nleast to the extent that he thinks he can remain neutral on the issue\nof the ontological commitments of mathematics.\n\nMathematics can be conceived as a science in such a way as to be\nindependent of any except the most rudimentary philosophical\nhypotheses. (p. 3)\n\n\nHence he is not motivated by an anti-platonist horror of abstract\nobjects. His neutrality, indeed, is somewhat compromised by the fact\nthat Curry is perfectly happy to commit to an infinite ontology of\npresumably abstract expression types. Officially he evinces\ndisinterest in what the primitives\u2014he misleadingly calls them\n\u2018tokens\u2019\u2014of his formal systems are:\n\nWe can take for those tokens any objects we please, and similarly we\ncan take for operators any ways of combining these objects which have\nthe requisite formal properties. (p. 28)\n\n\nBut since for many systems there are infinitely many primitive\n\u2018tokens\u2019, they cannot all be identified with concrete\nmarks which mathematicians have actually produced.\n\nLike the term formalist, Curry takes mathematics, properly\nreconstructed after philosophical reflection, to have an essentially\nsyntactic subject matter, namely formal systems. Unlike Frege\u2019s\nadversaries, though, Curry, writing after the development of the\ndiscipline of metamathematics, is able to give a far more rigorous\n(albeit in his case somewhat eccentric) account of what a formal\nsystem is.\n\nNo restrictions are placed on what form the axioms, rules and\ntherefore theorems of a formal system are to be. Truth for elementary\npropositions of a formal system consists simply in their provability\nin the system. One of his formal systems (Example 7, p. 23) has only\none predicate \u201ca unary predicate expressed by G\u00f6del by the\nwords \u2018ist beweisbar\u2019\u201d (p. 23), i.e., a provability\npredicate. The elementary truths of this system can be interpreted as\nclaims about provability in the underlying system. Any formal system\nof the usual sort could be \u2018reduced\u2019 into one in which\nthere is only one provability predicate and truth (= provability) in\nthe reducing system of the elementary proposition \\(\\vdash \\langle\n\\phi \\rangle\\) holds only when \\(\\phi\\) is provable in the reduced\nsystem (pp. 34\u201335). Curry allows that one can form compounds\nfrom elementary propositions by means of the usual logical operators\nin order to express complex propositions in the language of proof\ntheory (Chapter IX).\n\nThe upshot is that mathematics in general becomes metamathematics, a\ncontentful theory\u2014Curry\u2019s sentences express propositions\nwith truth values\u2014setting out the truths about what is provable\nfrom what in underlying formal systems whose interpretation, or rather\ninterpretations, are not taken to be mathematically important. This\nstandpoint, however, threatens to collapse into structuralism, into\nviewing mathematical utterances as schemata implicitly generalising\nover a range of (in general) abstract structures which satisfy the\nschemata. As to the problem of the metatheory, Curry does not seek to\nanswer this; there is no real attempt to avoid commitment to a rich\nontology of objects, except that, by considering only standard formal\nsystems, one could make do with a countable ontology which can play\nthe role of linguistic expressions. Only, however, at the cost of\ngrossly distorting mathematical practice. Set theorists, topologists,\nanalysts et al. entertain conjectures, and try to prove things\n\u2018about\u2019 sets, topological spaces, functions on the complex\nnumbers and so on. In their philosophical moments they may wonder just\nwhat the concepts they are wrestling with are \u2018about\u2019, but\nthey do not in general entertain conjectures or try to prove things\n\u2018about\u2019 expression strings, except where it is of\ninstrumental value to them in proving things about sets, spaces, the\ncomplex plane and so on (cf. Resnik pp. 70\u201371).\n",
