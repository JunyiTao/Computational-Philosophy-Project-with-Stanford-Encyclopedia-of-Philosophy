For convenience, assume also\nClassical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that\nthe singular terms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to\nand range over abstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one\nalso be a mathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that\nmathematical sentences refer to and quantify over satisfy either\nversion of the independence thesis?\n\nIt will be useful to restate our assumptions in more neutral terms. We\ncan do this by invoking the notion of a semantic value, which\nplays an important role in semantics and the philosophy of language.\nIn these fields it is widely assumed that each expression makes some\ndefinite contribution to the truth-value of sentences in which the\nexpression occurs. This contribution is known as the semantic\nvalue of the expression. It is widely assumed that (at least in\nextensional contexts) the semantic value of a singular term is just\nits referent.\n\nOur assumptions can now be stated neutrally as the claim that\nmathematical singular terms have abstract semantic values and that its\nquantifiers range over the kinds of item that serve as semantic\nvalues. Let\u2019s focus on the claim about singular terms. What is\nthe philosophical significance of this claim? In particular, does it\nsupport some version of Independence? The answer will\ndepend on what is required for a mathematical singular term to have a\nsemantic value.\n\nSome philosophers argue that not very much is required (Frege 1953,\nDummett 1981, Dummett 1991a, Wright 1983, Hale & Wright 2000, Rayo\n2013, and Linnebo 2012 and 2018). It suffices for the term \\(t\\) to\nmake some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in\nwhich it occurs. The whole purpose of the notion of a semantic value\nwas to represent such contributions. It therefore suffices for a\nsingular term to possess a semantic value that it makes some such\nsuitable contribution.\n\nThis may even open the way for a form of non-eliminative reductionism\nabout mathematical objects (Dummett 1991a, Linnebo 2018). Although it\nis perfectly true that the mathematical singular term \\(t\\) has an\nabstract object as its semantic value, this truth may obtain in virtue\nof more basic facts which do not mention or involve the relevant\nabstract object. For example, a singular term may refer to a direction\nin virtue of being associated with an appropriately oriented line and\nsubject to the criterion of identity stating that two lines specify\none and the same direction just in case they are parallel. Thus,\nalthough it is perfectly true that the term refers to an abstract\nobject, this truth obtains in virtue of some more basic facts that do\nnot mention or involve that abstract object. Linnebo (2018, ch. 11)\nargues that this approach to mathematical objects nevertheless\nvalidates Counterfactual Independence.\n\nThere is no reason, however, why an approach of this sort should be\ncommitted to Robust Independence. On the contrary, such approaches\nentail some important disanalogies between mathematical and physical\nobjects. For a direction to exist, for example, it suffices that there\nexists an appropriate oriented line that specifies that the direction.\nSince this line can be located anywhere, the existence of the\ndirection does not impose any constraints on any particular region of\nspacetime. By contrast, the existence of a physical object imposes\nsubstantial constraints on the particular region of spacetime where\nthe object is located. \n\nIn short, if some lightweight account of semantic values is\ndefensible, we can accept object realism and Counterfactual\nIndependence without committing ourselves to a more robust\nform of platonism.\n",
