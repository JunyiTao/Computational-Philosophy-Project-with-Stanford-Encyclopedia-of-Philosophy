Deontology\u2019s Relation(s) to Consequentialism Reconsidered\n\nThe perceived weaknesses of deontological theories have led some to\nconsider how to eliminate or at least reduce those weaknesses while\npreserving deontology\u2019s advantages. One way to do this is to embrace\nboth consequentialism and deontology, combining them into some kind of\na mixed theory. Given the differing notions of rationality underlying\neach kind of theory, this is easier said than done. After all, one\ncannot simply weigh agent-relative reasons against agent-neutral\nreasons, without stripping the former sorts of reasons of their\ndistinctive character.\n\nA time-honored way of reconciling opposing theories is to allocate\nthem to different jurisdictions. Tom Nagel\u2019s reconciliation of the two\ntheories is a version of this, inasmuch as he allocates the\nagent-neutral reasons of consequentialism to our\n\u201cobjective\u201d viewpoint, whereas the agent-relative reasons\nof deontology are seen as part of our inherent subjectivity (Nagel\n1986). Yet Nagel\u2019s allocations are non-exclusive; the same situation\ncan be seen from either subjective or objective viewpoints, meaning\nthat it is mysterious how we are to combine them into some overall\nview.\n\nA less mysterious way of combining deontology with consequentialism is\nto assign to each a jurisdiction that is exclusive of the other. One\npossibility here is to regard the agent-neutral reasons of\nconsequentialism as a kind of default rationality/morality in the\nsense that when an agent-relative permission or obligation applies, it\ngoverns, but in the considerable logical space where neither applies,\nconsequentialism holds sway (Moore 2008). Remembering that for the\nthreshold deontologist, consequentialist reasons may still determine\nright action even in areas governed by agent-relative obligations or\npermissions, once the level of bad consequences crosses the relevant\nthreshold (Moore 2012).\n",
