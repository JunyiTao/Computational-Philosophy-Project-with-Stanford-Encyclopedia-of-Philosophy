    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Cultural Capacities || Culture, Cumulative Culture, and Cultural Complexity\n3.1 Culture, Cumulative Culture, and Cultural Complexity\n\nTheorists of culture see great significance in a distinction between\nmere culture, on one hand, and cumulative culture, on the other. The\nlatter involves not just the spread of information between individuals\nvia social transmission, but the wherewithal of later generations to\nretain, refine, add to, and innovate on the cultural repertoire they\ninherit from previous generations. Some have claimed that cumulative\nculture is distinctly human and evolutionarily unique (Sterelny 2009,\nTomasello 2009) while others have suggested that rudimentary instances\nof cumulative culture can also be found in some non-human animals like\nwhales (Whitehead & Rendell 2015), Japanese monkeys (Schofield et\nal. 2018), and chimpanzees (Marshall-Pescini & Whiten 2008). There\nis little controversy, however, about the claim that the scale and\ncomplexity of human culture outstrips anything found in other animals\n(Dean et al. 2014). While some have expressed doubts about whether the\ncurrent evidence suffices to establish that most human cultural traits\nresult from the accumulation of modifications over time (Vaesen &\nHoukes 2021), most researchers hold that understanding our capacities\nfor cumulative culture, perhaps more so than those that underlie\nindividual intelligence, creativity, or problem solving, is crucial to\nunderstanding the distinctive character and success of the human\nspecies (Richerson & Boyd 2005; Sterelny 2009, 2012; J. Henrich\n2016; Derex & Boyd 2015; R. Boyd 2017; cf. Pinker 2010).\n\nThere remains disagreement on how to characterize the relevant notion\nof complexity, however. As Querbes, Vaesen, and Houkes (2014) note,\nincrease in cultural complexity has been characterized in several\nways, including as an increase in a trait\u2019s fitness, as an\nincrease in the number of elements that make up a trait, and as an\nincrease in the difficulty of transmitting the trait faithfully (see\nalso Mesoudi & Thornton 2018) or how difficult it is to learn (J.\nHenrich 2004). These characterizations are not theoretically or\nempirically equivalent, and each suffers from its own shortcomings.\nSpecifying complexity in terms of fitness, for instance, seems to\nrequire an agreed upon metric for cultural fitness, but no such metric\nhas been widely accepted (Ramsey & De Block 2017). Relatedly,\nwhile it is relatively easy to recognize episodes of technological\nchange that are instances of progress, it is far less clear how to\nevaluate changes in other kinds of cultural traits, and so it remains\ndifficult to know when transformations in, say, a religious or\nlinguistic system should be classified as improvements or degradations\n(Miton & Charbonneau 2018).\n\nAttempts to characterize cultural complexity by appeal to number of\nelements confront an individuation problem, and it remains unclear how\nto determine what counts either as a distinct element or a single\ntrait. A similar individuation problem emerged in the debate over\ncultural replication. Dawkins famously coined the term\n\u2018meme\u2019 to refer to discrete bits of culture that play a\nrole in cultural evolution similar to that played by genes in\nbiological evolution, arguing that memes are independent replicators\nwhose propagation serves their own interests (Dawkins 1976).\nSubsequent research revealed, however, that it is very difficult to\ndetermine how a bit of cultural information might qualify as single\nmeme (Chvaja 2020), and many scholars are skeptical that cultural\nvariants are usefully thought of as being discrete or primarily\nserving their own interests (Hull 1982, 1988; Heyes & Plotkin\n1989; R. Boyd & Richerson 2000; Claidi\u00e8re &\nAndr\u00e9 2012; De Block & Ramsey 2016). Consequently, memetics\nhas largely disappeared from academic discussion (though see Sterelny\n2006 and Dennett 2017 for exceptions).\n\nWhat has not entirely waned, however, are debates over the nature of\ncultural acquisition, whether and when the spread of culture is\nusefully thought of in terms of replication, and if not why not. Some\nproponents of replication hold that most stable cultural traditions\nare primarily the result of imitation, and that imitation drives a\nkind of faithful, high fidelity copying of cultural variants that\nshould qualify as replication (Tomasello 1999). Dual inheritance\ntheorists argue that the type of high fidelity copying suggested by\nthe term \u2018replication\u2019 may or may not be rare, but it is\nnot required for complex cultural adaptations to evolve. Rather,\ncumulative cultural evolution can be sustained by low fidelity\nimitation because the influence of many teachers and models can\ncompensate for noise and copying errors (J. Henrich & Boyd 2002).\nCultural epidemiologists also reject the need for replication, arguing\ninstead that many traditions are mainly the result of \u2018guided\nvariation\u2019. This is a phenomenon whereby learners do not simply\ncopy what they are exposed to, but rather creatively reconstruct\nrepresentations from what they observe, slightly but significantly\naltering the cultural variants they acquire in the process of\nacquiring them. In these cases, the recipient of the cultural signal\nis not a passive vessel, but actively filters or even transforms the\nrepresentations that they adopt. Moreover, cultural epidemiologists\nhold that these processes of reconstructive learning are\nsystematically influenced by stable features of human cognitive\narchitecture, which can be represented as \u2018attractors\u2019 in\nthe abstract possibility space of cultural evolutionary models\n(Sperber 1996; Claidi\u00e8re & Sperber 2007; Claidi\u00e8re,\nScott-Phillips, & Sperber 2014; Lewens 2015; Morin 2011 [2016];\nBuskell 2017; Scott-Phillips 2017). For example, a proponent of\n\u2018pure\u2019 replication might hold that the pronunciation of\nwords remains relatively stable because individuals tend to copy with\nhigh fidelity the pronunciation of their peers and parents. A\nproponent of the cultural epidemiology approach could offer a\ndifferent explanation, claiming rather that the pronunciation of words\nevolves in the direction of better fit with the mechanisms of\nverbalization, comprehension, and retention, and then stabilizes\naround these attractors (for similarly competing accounts of some of\nthe common features of religion, see Boyer 2001; Atran 2002;\nNorenzayan et al. 2016).\n\nAs just noted, this debate about cultural transmission and the\ncomplexity and character of cultural variants is entangled with\ndebates about different kinds of human universals, how common or rare\nthey are, and how they should be explained (Brown 1991, 2004; Singh et\nal 2021; also see J. Henrich, Blasi, et al. forthcoming). For example,\nif features of a shared human psychological nature are implicated in\nreconstructive social learning, and those features, in turn, help\nstabilize certain types of group level behavioral regularities by\nfunneling social transmission towards cultural attractors, then those\ntypes of group level behavioral regularities are likely to be common\nto many cultures (Sperber 1996; De Cruz 2006). If, on the contrary,\nhigh-fidelity copying is the rule in social learning, then small\nmodifications in initial conditions, minor copying errors, and slight\nperturbations in the flow of cultural information have a better chance\nof being propagated, and to develop into more and more dramatic\ndifferences between cultures (Acerbi & Mesoudi 2015; but see\nTchernichovski, Eisenberg-Edidin, & Jarvis 2021 for how imitation\ncan sustain high ingroup variability).\n\nTo a large extent, many of these are empirical issues that turn on the\nrelative importance of the respective transmission processes in\ndifferent episodes of social learning, as well as the relative effect\nof each process on cultural stability. However, there may be\nconceptual issues involved as well (Lewens 2015), concerning whether\nor not the type of cognitive reconstruction of cultural variants\nposited to occur in guided variation is necessarily at odds with\nreplication, or is perhaps a process that sometimes produces\nhigh-fidelity copies, but other times does not (Boudry 2018). Such\nlocal discussions are part of the larger debate over how to best\nconceptualize, study, and understand the significance of cumulative\nculture, cultural complexity, and the psychology and population\nstructure (e.g., Derex & Mesoudi 2020) required to create and\nsustain it.\n",
