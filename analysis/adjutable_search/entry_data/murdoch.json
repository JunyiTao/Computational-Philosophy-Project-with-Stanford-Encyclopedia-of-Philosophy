    "main_text": "\n1. Overview\n\nMurdoch\u2019s family was middle class (her father was a civil\nservant) and Irish Protestant (an identity that remained important to\nMurdoch throughout her life). They moved to London from Ireland when\nMurdoch was very young. Murdoch attended Oxford University,\noverlapping with three other women\u2014Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa\nFoot, and Mary Midgley\u2014at a time (1938\u20131942) when many\nmale students were away at war. Foot, Murdoch, and Midgley all became\nprominent and influential moral philosophers, and Anscombe a prominent\nphilosopher of action and a student, friend, translator and\ninterpreter of Wittgenstein.\n\nThe four (now being referred to as the \u201cWartime Quartet\u201d\n[MacCumhaill & Wiseman 2022; Lipscomb 2021]) stayed in\ntouch after the war, and Murdoch did so with each of them\nindividually. All four pushed back against various aspects of the\nmale-dominated Oxford orthodoxy of linguistic and analytic philosophy\n(e.g., the fact/value dichotomy, the severing of ethics from an\nunderstanding of human nature, the neglect of virtue and vice), though\ntheir own philosophies differed significantly from one another.\n\nOver her lifetime Murdoch developed an entirely distinctive position\nin moral philosophy, as well as philosophy of art and religion (both\nof which she saw as important for morality). She was engaged with the\nAnglo-American moral philosophy of that period and its historical\nantecedents (such as Hobbes and Hume) but was equally engaged\nthroughout her life with traditional and some then-current\n\u201cContinental\u201d philosophy\u2014especially Schopenhauer,\nHegel, Heidegger (on whom she wrote a book, to be published in the\nnear future), Sartre, Adorno, Buber, and Derrida; with Christian\nthinkers St. Paul, St. Augustine, Anselm, Eckhart, Julian of Norwich;\nand with Hindu and especially Buddhist thought. Her views were also\nstrongly influenced by Plato, Kant, Simone Weil, and Wittgenstein, and\nshe declared herself in 1968 to be \u201ca kind of Platonist\u201d\n(Rose 1968).\n2. Murdoch\u2019s Trajectory and Reception\n\nMurdoch taught at Oxford from 1948\u20131963 (as both tutor and\nlecturer), and was highly regarded by colleagues, often appearing in\ncollections and BBC programs with leading British philosophers\ngenerally though not always in the analytic or linguistic tradition.\nShe was comfortable with the analytic approach, though her thinking\nwas clearly headed in different directions, in part because of the\ninfluence of Simone Weil (Broackes 2012a: 19\u201320).\n\nHowever, unusual for Oxford philosophers of that period, she was also\ndrawn to Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s existentialism, to which she had\nbeen exposed while working after the war in Belgium (and Austria) for\nthe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).\nHer first book, in 1953, was Sartre: Romantic Rationalist.\nShe was instrumental in bringing French thinkers of that period,\nincluding also Simone de Beauvoir, the feminist/existentialist, and\nAlbert Camus, to an English-speaking audience.\n\nMurdoch left her position at Oxford in 1963 (though she continued to\nlive in Oxford for some of each week) and increasingly lost touch with\nBritish academic philosophy. As of this writing, Murdoch is best known\nfor a collection of three essays written in the 1960s, none originally\npublished in easily accessible philosophy venues, published in 1970 as\nThe Sovereignty of Good. This collection is by far the main\nsource for professional philosophers writing on Murdoch, and of\nMurdoch\u2019s broader impact on moral philosophy, and this entry\nwill draw largely but not exclusively on that work.\n\nToward the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, some Anglo-American\nphilosophers began to make use of Murdoch in criticizing moral\nphilosophy of the day, or in developing a distinctive position of\ntheir own. This included Charles Taylor, Hilary Putnam, Cora Diamond,\nGenevieve Lloyd, John McDowell, Raimond Gaita, Martha Nussbaum,\nLawrence Blum and Sabina Lovibond. This early secondary literature did\nnot involve deep scholarly engagement with Murdoch\u2019s own work,\nbut was inspired by it and helped bring Murdoch to the attention of\nthe wider professional philosophical world.\n\nA collection of almost all Murdoch\u2019s previous articles\n(including those in Sovereignty) plus a short book on Plato\nwas published in 1997, as Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on\nPhilosophy and Literature, edited by her friend and biographer,\nthe literary scholar Peter Conradi. That and the first scholarly\ncollection on her work, Iris Murdoch and the Search for Human\nGoodness (Antonaccio & Schweiker 1996), with essays by\ntheologians and philosophers (including Diamond, Nussbaum, and Taylor)\nprompted an increase in scholarship directly on Murdoch in the 2000s.\nJustin Broackes\u2019s Iris Murdoch, Philosopher, in 2012,\nwas the first all-philosopher collection on Murdoch. While the recent\nscholarship sometimes aims at demonstrating Murdoch\u2019s relevance\nto current live issues in Anglo-American ethics (Setiya 2013; Hopwood\n2018), increasingly, scholarship (including the two articles just\ncited) engages with Murdoch\u2019s own philosophical\npreoccupations on her terms.\n\nIn 1992, Murdoch published her sole book working out her own\nphilosophical views (Sovereignty being a collection of\nseparately published essays), Metaphysics as a Guide to\nMorals. Murdoch\u2019s views, especially in the latter work,\nhave been difficult for contemporary philosophers to place comfortably\nwithin the intellectual terrain of moral philosophy as it has\ndeveloped in our time, in part because of her unusual range of\nintellectual touchstones; in part because, especially in\nMetaphysics, she seldom writes in a standard\n\u201cargument/conclusion\u201d format; and in part because of her\nintellectual distance from contemporary Anglo-American philosophy.\nThere is currently very little secondary literature on\nMetaphysics, but Dooley and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s 2019\ncollection, Reading Iris Murdoch\u2019s Metaphysics as a Guide to\nMorals will hopefully spur further scholarship on that work. A\nRoutledge Handbook, Hopwood and Panizza\u2019s The Murdochian\nMind (forthcoming), will contribute substantially to\nMurdoch scholarship.\n\nMurdoch is distinctive as a philosopher in another way as well.\nBeginning in 1954, she became a published novelist, with twenty-six\nnovels in her lifetime, several of which won or were short-listed for\nimportant British literary prizes. Although her philosophy and her\nnovels can be read entirely separately from one another, they are\nplausibly regarded as connected and mutually illuminating, although in\ninterviews Murdoch sometimes denied this. A good deal of scholarly\nliterature (mostly from literary scholars [but from the philosophy\nside, see Nussbaum 1990; Browning 2018b]) is devoted to exploring\ntheir connection and non-connection. Murdoch is the subject of an\naward-winning biography, Iris: The Life of Iris Murdoch, by\nPeter Conradi (2001), and an award-winning film of that same year,\nIris (dir: Richard Eyre), based on a memoir by\nMurdoch\u2019s husband, John Bayley, which focuses largely on her\ndecline into Alzheimer\u2019s in her last years (Bayley 1999).  The\nIris Murdoch Society publishes (since 2008) a twice-yearly journal,\nthe Iris Murdoch Review (see Other Internet\nResources), that had been almost entirely a venue for scholarship\nand commentary on Murdoch\u2019s literary oeuvre, but recently has\nstarted to carry much more philosophy.\n3. Murdoch in Her Times\n\nAs is generally recognized, the English philosophical tradition has a\nstrong empiricist and anti-metaphysical bent. An important exception\nwas the late 19th and early 20th century\nmovement of a Hegelian-influenced \u201cabsolute idealism\u201d,\nwhose most prominent exponent was F.H. Bradley (1846\u20131924). This\nmovement was seen as discredited by two prominent early\n20th century British philosophers, G.E. Moore and Bertrand\nRussell. The final blow was dealt by A.J. Ayer \u201clogical\npositivist\u201d work, Language, Truth, and Logic,\nchanneling for an English audience views developed by the Vienna\nCircle in the 1920s and 30s. Logical positivism essentially declared\nthat what made a statement meaningful was the possibility of verifying\nit through empirical observation. Science was seen as the paradigm,\nthough not the only, form of meaningful discourse. Metaphysical\nstatements typical of British Idealism, such as that \u201call\nreality is one\u201d or that \u201ctime is unreal\u201d, were\nviewed as meaningless because unverifiable. Ethical and evaluative\nstatements, such as that killing is wrong, were taken to have no\ncognitive significance. Murdoch thus came of age when the metaphysical\ntradition was still within memory (she read Bradley seriously and\ntaught him), even if regarded as discredited. For her entire career,\nshe retained a strong sense of the value of metaphysics both in itself\nand as providing broader visions and structures for moral\nphilosophical reflection, while also appreciating the force of\nespecially a Wittgensteinian critique of traditional metaphysics. Her\nmain tutor at Oxford, Donald MacKinnon, with whom she remained close\nthrough much of her younger life, was a philosophical theologian, and\nhelped influence her in a less positivistic direction, also less\ndistant from and hostile to religion (MacKinnon 1957).\n\nSoon verificationism and its related ethical view,\n\u201cemotivism\u201d (ethical statements express emotions,\nespecially of approval and disapproval) was abandoned and a more\nsophisticated, and (in Oxford) a much more influential view of ethical\nlanguage was developed by R.M. Hare, in his 1952 The Language of\nMorals. Hare said that moral statements did not aim to make\ntruthful assertions, but had a distinct character as prescriptions,\ntelling their addressees to do what is stated in the prescription.\nHare\u2019s view, \u201cuniversal prescriptivism\u201d, said that a\nprescription no matter what its content was moral if the subject\nprescribed it for all (or everyone relevantly similarly situated), and\nin that sense universally.\n\nHare\u2019s account of ethics involved several assumptions, not\nalways articulated, but widely shared in the practice of moral\nphilosophy in the 1950s (and many of them beyond). Murdoch\u2019s\nrejection of all of them provides an essential backdrop to her\ndistinctive approach to ethics.\n\n Fact/value dichotomy: A fact can never entail a\nvalue. If a term appears to be simultaneously factual and evaluative\n(e.g., \u201crude\u201d, to take an example made famous by\nMurdoch\u2019s dear friend Philippa Foot), it is really a conjunction\nof a descriptive/factual meaning and an evaluation conferred on the\nfactual referent by the speaker. This view is inherited from the\nempiricist tradition \u201ccreated in the scientific image\u201d (SG\n1970:\n 28/321[1]).\n Murdoch says it is \u201cthe most important argument in modern moral\nphilosophy\u201d (M&E 1957/EM: 64).\nMoral agents all inhabit the same shared world of\nfacts (M&E 1957/EM: 71).\nValues are not part of the world, capable of being\ndiscovered by individual agents, but are brought to or projected onto\nthe world by moral agents. Quite often, situations present no moral\nissues for the agent at all. \nThe fundamental subject matter of ethics is what acts\npersons should perform, and principles and procedures for determining\nthose acts, not what kind of person it is good to be (e.g., what sort\nof qualities of character, or virtues, it is good to have), or how to\ndescribe the human world, an enterprise Murdoch takes to be inherently\nethical.\n\u201cThe individual\u2019s \u2018stream of\nconsciousness\u2019 is of comparatively little importance, partly\nbecause it is often not there at all, and more pertinently because it\nis and can only be through overt acts that we can characterize another\nperson mentally or morally\u201d (VCM 1956/EM 77). Inner reflection\nis of moral interest only as it issues in choice, decision and\naction. \nMetaphysics has no legitimate role to play in ethics,\nand is not an intellectually coherent project. \nThe role of the moral philosopher is distinct from\nthat of the moralist, who aims to \u201celaborate a moral code or\nencourage its observance\u201d, as Ayer says (Warnock 1960: 131). The task of the\nmoral philosopher is to analyze the character of moral statements, a\nlinguistic/analytic rather than moral enterprise. The moral\nphilosopher qua philosopher should remain neutral on specific moral\nissues or more generally on questions about how to act and live.\n\n\nMurdoch\u2019s rejection of all these views in her writings of the\n1950s and 60s is partly connected with her take on existentialism.\nExistentialism attracted Murdoch partly because it was a philosophy\none could \u201cinhabit\u201d or \u201clive by\u201d [OGG:\n47/337]. For existentialism it mattered tremendously what one did, in\nparticular situations as well as with one\u2019s life overall, and\nhow philosophy was to guide and illuminate that journey. That sense of\nurgency is lacking in British philosophical ethics in its turn toward\ncharacterizing \u201cthe language of morals\u201d, partly because\nthis enterprise was seen as morally neutral, not having implications\nfor conduct. (Murdoch\u2019s friend Foot, who herself famously\nchallenged the idea that the language of morals was morally neutral,\npoignantly captured Murdoch\u2019s relation to the linguistic turn in\nethics: \u201cWe were interested in moral language, she was\ninterested in the moral life\u2026She left us, in the end\u201d\n[Conradi 2001: 302].)\n4. Murdoch\u2019s View of the Self Against the Existentialist/Behaviorist Account\n\nMurdoch developed her own view of morality in reaction against both\nHare and (notwithstanding her admiration for it) Sartrean\nexistentialism as she understood it. (For a critique of her take on\nexistentialism, see Moran 2012.) Both viewed freedom as fundamental to\nthe moral enterprise. For Hare the moral agent is free to choose their\nmoral values, constrained only by the requirement that the agent\nprescribe those values universally. Sartre shares the former view but\neschews the universalist \u201clogic of morality\u201d\n constraint.[2]\n For Sartre, anguish (Angst) attends our recognition that our choices\nare totally up to us; Hare\u2019s view lacks that existential\nanguish. But what interests Murdoch is their shared privileging of the\nchoosing will in the moral enterprise, the central image of the moral\nagent as responsible and free (and, in Hare\u2019s case, rational),\nand their rejection of a structure of objective value outside the\nindividual that gives authoritative direction for deciding and\nchoosing. Murdoch sees the appeal of this view, in both its\nexistentialist and analytic forms, but finds it false to our moral\nexperience and to the nature of moral agency.\n\nIn the 1962 \u201cThe Idea of Perfection\u201d (in\nSovereignty), Murdoch begins to develop a contrasting picture\nof the self, moral agency, and moral reality, building on her 1956\n\u201cVision and Choice in Morality\u201d. Her stated target is not\nHare, who is only briefly mentioned, but Stuart Hampshire, whom she\nadmired as a subtler and deeper thinker (and to whom she dedicated\nSovereignty) and whom she regarded, in his 1959 Thought\nand Action, as having articulated and defended much more\nexplicitly than Hare the view of human agency and the self underlying\nHare\u2019s moral theory (largely but not entirely incorporating the\nseven characteristics of Hare\u2019s philosophy mentioned above).\nMurdoch says that the will does not engage in choice out of nowhere,\nbut out of a rich and complex individual psyche formed by ongoing\nattitudes, perceptions, drives, attachments, beliefs, and modes of\nattention. This substantial self is in the process of formation,\nchange, and development all the time; and it provides the context for\nchoice in determinate situations (against\n point 4 above).\n Murdoch notes that sometimes our way of apprehending a particular\nsituation will seem to make so evident to us what we should do that\nprocesses of deliberation standardly underlying choice will not be\nnecessary and we will simply perform the action. We should not, she\nthinks, value a kind of \u201cfreedom\u201d that would exert will\ncontrary to an accurate perception of moral features of the situation\nthat bear on conduct.\n\nMurdoch says that philosophy should develop a moral or philosophical\npsychology that provides the terms in which to understand and\ncharacterize the substantial self to which she gives center stage,\ndisplacing the existentialist/analytic (which she sometimes calls\n\u201cexistentialist-behavioristic\u201d) freely choosing will. This\ncall for a new turn in philosophical ethics toward what came to be\ncalled \u201cmoral psychology\u201d helped to usher in that subject.\nIt somewhat echoed Murdoch\u2019s friend Elizabeth Anscombe\u2019s\nsimilar but more radical and striking charge in her 1958 \u201cModern\nMoral Philosophy\u201d to put the subject of ethics on hold until a\nphilosophical psychology that clarified the notions of intention,\nwill, desire, and belief could be developed. But Anscombe thought of\nphilosophical psychology as an enterprise independent of and prior to\ndoing ethics (Anscombe 1958 [1997: 38]). By contrast Murdoch did not\nthink such a philosophical psychology (a term she also sometimes used\nbut more frequently used \u201cmoral psychology\u201d) could be\nseparated from ethics (OGG: 46/337; Diamond 2010; Brewer 2009:\n8\u20139).\n\nMurdoch takes some steps toward developing such a moral psychology by\nembracing Freud as the great theorist of the human mind, who \n\n\nsees the psyche as an egocentric system of quasi-mechanical energy,\nlargely determined by its own individual history, whose natural\nattachments are sexual, ambiguous, and hard for the subject to\nunderstand or control. (OGG: 51/341) \n\n\nThis substantial self constrains the will much more extensively than\nthe existentialist/analytic picture recognizes. \u201cThe area of\n[the moral agent\u2019s] vaunted freedom of choice is not usually\nvery great\u201d (SGC: 78/364). We cannot easily rid ourselves of\npernicious emotions, attachments and motives that work against moral\nmotivation and behavior. Murdoch adds, \n\n\nIntrospection reveals only the deep tissue of ambivalent motive, and\nfantasy is a stronger force than reason. Objectivity and unselfishness\nare not natural to human beings. (OGG: 51/241) \n\n\nShe sees the Freudian view as \u201ca realistic and detailed picture\nof the fallen man\u201d (OGG: 51/241), one of many places where her\nphilosophy is influenced by a Christian worldview, as she fully\nrecognizes. This pessimistic view of the human psyche plays a central\nrole in Murdoch\u2019s thought for her entire life, bolstered by her\nencounter with Schopenhauer and her particular take on Kant, both of\nwhom articulate a philosophic dualism with a strong egoistic\nanti-moral force countered by a moral force (differing among those\ntwo philosophers) in the psyche.\n5. Moral Reality and Moral Realism\n\nMurdoch\u2019s critique of the existentialist/analytic conception of\nthe self and the will mirrors her critique of both the Sartrean and\nHarean rejection of a moral reality outside the individual self. She\nbelieves in that reality, that it can be known by human persons, and\nthat that reality, or the apprehension of it, motivates us to act\nmorally. She is thus a \u201cmoral realist\u201d, \u201cmoral\nobjectivist\u201d and \u201cmoral cognitivist\u201d (thus rejecting\n point 3\n [values are not part of the world]).\n\nThere are three distinct strands within Murdoch\u2019s conception of\nmoral reality\u2014\u201cother persons\u201d, \u201cthe\nGood\u201d, and \u201cmetaphysics\u201d. Murdoch does not pull the\nthree together into an overall systematic view of moral reality.\n5.1 Moral reality as other persons\n\nA central strand in Murdoch\u2019s view is that moral reality is\nother persons. Murdoch is not thinking of \u201cother persons\u201d\nas an aggregate, nor primarily as instances of a category. Rather a\ngiven moral agent\u2019s moral reality consists in the individual\nreality of each other person, one at a time.\n\nIn this strand, Murdoch emphasizes the complexity and difficulty of\napprehending the moral reality in question. She says that we are prone\nto fantasy and egoism (the \u201cfat, relentless ego\u201d [OGG:\n52/342]) that block us from being able to see other persons clearly;\nfrom appreciating that they are as real as oneself (SBL 1959/EM: 215);\nfrom a lived recognition of their separateness and differentness (OGG:\n66/353); and from grasping their true individual character (OGG:\n59/348). Our ego must in a way be silenced\u2014a process she refers\nto as \u201cunselfing\u201d (a concept she draws from Simone\nWeil\u2019s \u201cd\u00e9creation\u201d)\u2014in order for us to\nfully grasp reality in this\n sense.[3]\n (\u201cWe cease to be in order to attend to the existence of\nsomething else\u201d. OGG: 59/349) Murdoch\u2019s novels frequently\nportray characters lost in their own world who see others primarily\nthrough their own fantasies of them. But Murdoch also emphasizes a\nmore general contingency and idiosyncrasy of persons, resulting in a\ngeneral opaqueness of persons to each other, a point apparently\nindependent of the one about fantasy and egoism, though complementing\nit.\n\nMurdoch thinks grasping the reality of the other comes in degrees,\nthat extend to a \u201cperfect\u201d understanding of another, a\nstate that can be aimed at but not actually attained. She often speaks\nof levels of understanding\u2014of persons, concepts, ideas\u2014an\nidea she increasingly comes to associate with Plato, and that she\nconnects with a \u201cperfectionism\u201d that holds out the perfect\nunderstanding as a (moral) standard (IP: 29/322; OGG: 61/350). The\nmoral challenge of knowing the other differs for each individual agent\nbecause each agent encounters different people, but also because the\ntask and challenge of knowing differs for each agent in relation to\neach other person.\n\nSometimes Murdoch expresses the \u201cother persons\u201d strand in\nmore general terms\u2014not only individual persons but\n\u201cindividual realities\u201d outside the (agent\u2019s) self.\nThis can include natural objects such as a tree or an individual\nanimal, but also non-animate and conceptual objects such as a language\nor a subject matter, and also situations. She sometimes, and\nincreasingly so in Metaphysics, sees an appreciation of all\nof reality in its manifold detail as a crucial form of moral\naspiration, and there is evidence in her novels of a special\nappreciation of natural objects, not only living beings, and not only\nas beautiful (White 2020). But more frequently Murdoch regards other\npersons specifically as the content of moral reality.\n5.2 Moral reality as Platonic good\n\nA second, and increasingly prominent, strand in Murdoch\u2019s view\nof moral reality is that it is \u201cThe Good\u201d, understood in a\nPlatonic sense. One element in Murdoch\u2019s Platonism is that\nsomething like the form of the Good constitutes what is known when we\nhave moral knowledge, and is also what is sought and loved. We achieve\nthat understanding through knowing and loving the good in good\nparticular things (including persons but also art, nature and ideas),\nthen ascending to an understanding of Good itself. (Murdoch frequently\nemploys Plato\u2019s \u201cascending\u201d metaphor [e.g., SGC:\n94/377].) Murdoch also says, attributing it to Plato, that the Good is\nlike a light that enables us to see goodness in particular things\n(SGC: 93/376).\n\nMurdoch explicitly rejects two philosophically familiar ways to\nunderstand \u201cgood\u201d\u2014a functional use (\u201cgood\nknife\u201d; SGC: 93/376) and good as \u201cthe most general\nadjective of commendation\u201d (SGC: 98/381). These do not give us a\nclue to the concept. \u201cA genuine mysteriousness attaches to the\nidea of goodness and the Good\u201d (SGC: 99/381).\n\nWhile the Good is an object of both knowledge and love for Murdoch\n(and she links those two notions (\u201cto love, that is, to\nsee\u201d [OGG: 66/354]; \u201cattention to reality inspired by,\nconsisting of, love\u201d [OGG: 67/354]), she does not subscribe to\nthe aspect of Plato\u2019s view that regards the forms as more real\nthan individual objects and persons who partake of them in the world\nof experience, nor as inhabiting a transcendent world beyond our world\nof experience (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen 2019: 267). And she rejects this as a\nproper interpretation of Plato (SGC: 96/378f; Robjant provides a\ndetailed defense of her interpretation of Plato [Robjant 2012].)).\n The Good and other persons are distinct strands in Murdoch\u2019s\nview of moral reality. But they reinforce each other. Hopwood\ninterprets Murdoch as saying that \u201cwe love particular\nindividuals in light of the Good, and we love the Good through\nparticular individuals\u201d (Hopwood 2018: 486). Murdoch\u2019s\nview is not analogous to Kant\u2019s idea that respecting the other\nperson involves directing that respect to the moral law or rational\nwill within them, or to their best self. (Velleman defends a form of\nKant\u2019s view as Murdochian, understanding rational will to be the\ncapacity for valuing [Velleman 1999 (2006: 100)]. Hopwood criticizes\nthis view [Hopwood 2018: 482].) For Murdoch loving and knowing other\npersons is also not the same as knowing what is distinctly good in\nthem or about them.  Susan Wolf rejects the idea that loving attention\nas Murdoch (and she) understand it affirms the moral goodness, or\noverall goodness, of its object. One can love, and direct loving\nattention to, another whose deficiencies and faults she fully\nrecognizes (Wolf 2014). Both Cordner and Wolf emphasize that it is the\nperson as a whole that is the proper object of loving attention\n(Cordner 2016; Wolf 2014). Murdoch agrees, in giving a criticism of\nKant: \u201cKant does not tell us to respect whole particular\ntangled-up historical individuals\u201d (M&E 1957/EM: 215).\n\nOther connections between the Platonic and the other persons strands,\nnot necessarily incompatible with the ones mentioned, have been\nproposed. Clarke suggests that the Good is a perfectionist principle\nin Murdoch, so that seeing other persons in light of the Good is just\nan expression of her perfectionism, pushing the agent to achieve a\nmore and more just, loving, and complete perception of that person\n(Clarke 2012). Dorothy Emmet, an older contemporary and friend of\nMurdoch presses a similar view, that the Good should be thought of as\na \u201cregulative ideal\u201d in the Kantian sense, \u201can\nindefinable standard towards which we can turn in appreciation\nof\u201d what is Good (or Beautiful). But Emmet differs from Clarke\nin denying that this is a moral principle (Emmet 1994 [this book was\ndedicated to Murdoch]: 65\u201366; see also 1979 for one of the first\nscholarly engagements with Murdoch). Emmet likely also influenced\nMurdoch\u2019s resistance to British philosophy\u2019s jettisoning\nof metaphysics in its analytic and linguistic modalities in the 1950s,\nthrough Emmet\u2019s defense of metaphysics in her 1945 The\nNature of Metaphysical Thinking; which Murdoch read, and in her\nand Murdoch\u2019s attempts starting in the 1950s (and in all of\nMurdoch\u2019s subsequent writings) to bring religion and philosophy\ncloser together. Murdoch acknowledges that the Christian conception of\nGod influences her understanding of the Good. \u201cI shall suggest\nthat God was (or is) a single perfect transcendent non-representable\nand necessarily real object of attention\u201d and that we should\nretain a non-theistic concept [i.e., Good] with those characteristics\n(OGG: 55/344). This semi-religious dimension relates to the idea\nMurdoch occasionally expresses, and more so in Metaphysics,\nthat the Good is a source of energy that is not found within our\n\u201cnatural psychology\u201d (OGG: 71/358).\n5.3 Murdoch, Sidgwick, Plato and the self/other moral framework\n Though \u201cthe Good\u201d is a distinctly Platonic strand in\nMurdoch\u2019s view of moral reality, the \u201cother persons\u201d\nstrand is un-Platonic in two important ways. One is that it involves a\nsharp separation between self and other, and identifies morality with\nattention to, love of, or concern for the other and not the self.\nHenry Sidgwick articulated a standard view in Anglo-American moral\nphilosophy on this matter when he said that the field of ethics made\nan important step beyond the ancients when it articulated\nself-interest as a distinct rational principle of action that is\nseparate from a principle of the good of others, understood\nimpersonally. (He attributed this discovery to Bishop Butler.)\n(Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 404]; Sidgwick 1886 [1902: 197\u20138]; Brewer\n2009: 193). Neither Plato nor Aristotle have this exclusively\nother-focused conception of virtue, common to both Murdoch and the\ntradition Sidgwick identifies and praises. Murdoch agrees with\nSidgwick\u2019s self/other distinction as one of great moral\nsignificance, though she does not regard cognizing or caring for the\nother in terms either of rationality or principle.\n\nA second difference from Plato (and Aristotle) is Murdoch\u2019s\nrejection of the Greeks\u2019 sense that virtue and virtuous action\nare good for their agent as well as for their own sake (but the former\n\u201cgood for\u201d is not understood by Plato or Aristotle\nprudentially and is not separable from virtue being good for its own\nsake [Brewer 2009: 202]).  For Murdoch it is indeed good to act\nvirtuously, and doing so helps to constitute the agent as morally\ngood. But she does not understand this virtuousness as intrinsically\ngood for the agent. Virtue is pointless, as Murdoch often\nsays (OGG: 71/358; SGC: 78/364), and this is tied up with the view,\nwhich she sees as historically produced from Kant to Existentialism,\nthat there is no inherent purpose in human life. \u201cWe are simply\nhere\u201d with no larger purpose or telos (SGC:\n79/364). But in the face of this purposelessness, being and becoming a\nmorally good person through a suppression or transcendence of self is\nthe best aspiration we can have.\n\nDespite aligning with Sidgwick regarding the identification of\nmorality solely with an appropriate focus on the other and the\nother\u2019s welfare, not that of the self, Murdoch\u2019s view\ndiffers from Sidgwick\u2019s, as well as from much of the English\nempiricist tradition in ethics (Hutcheson, Hume, Mill), in three\ncrucial respects. First, she pays very little attention to\nself-interest as an egoistic obstacle to morality through our\nunduly privileging our own interests over those of others. For Murdoch\nthe prime self-oriented obstacle to morality is fantasy, which gets in\nthe way of our seeing the other person as a distinct, separate, other\nbeing with their own reality. Sometimes the personal fantasy idea is\nbound up with self-absorption, which keeps us from being more\nthan barely aware of others at all. More frequently it is our\ninvestment in false ideas of the (particular) other expressed in the\nfantasy idea. Neither of these, however, is self-interest as an\noverall motive or principle as Sidgwick envisages. All three (fantasy,\nself-absorption, self-interest) are egoistic but in distinct ways.\n\nA second difference from Sidgwick (and from Butler, Hume, and\nHutcheson, and the empiricist temper of British philosophy more generally)\nis Murdoch\u2019s understanding of moral realism. She is viewing\nmorality not only as calling for a greater focus on the well-being of\nothers rather than the self, but saying that doing so involves being\nin touch with, being responsive to, reality itself, while egoism\ninvolves living in falsehood, being out of touch with reality.\n\u201cThe self, the place where we live, is a place of\nillusion\u201d (SGC: 93/376). \u201cThe authority of morality is the\nauthority of truth, that is, of reality\u201d (SGC: 90f/374).\n\nDiamond and Brewer both note that Murdoch shares with both Plato and\nAristotle the view that reality is irreducibly evaluative (Diamond\n2010, 59f; Brewer 2009: 152). The identification of the Real with the\nGood is a deep part of Murdoch\u2019s view (Brewer 2009:\n152). Murdoch recognizes that the view of reality as evaluatively\ninert (in addition to human life having no telos) is an\nhistorical product, tied up with the rise of natural science, with\nKant playing a particularly important role in solidifying it within\nthe Western philosophic tradition (MGM 1992: 40). She views Kant as\ntrying to rescue value and morality in the face of this scientistic\nview of reality (MGM 1992: 50), but she entirely rejects that\n(unPlatonic) view of reality. Diamond argues that in doing so she also\nrejects the related Kantian distinction between the theoretical domain\nand the practical domain (Diamond 2010: 73).\n\nA third difference between Murdoch and the British tradition in ethics\nis that the latter largely fails to recognize the difficulty\nand psychic complexity, so central to Murdoch\u2019s view, of knowing\nthe (individual) other, and thus also often of knowing how to act\ntoward them so as to bring about their well-being. The notion of\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d as employed in that tradition is taken to\nimply that being motivated to help others is sufficient to bring about\nwhat is good for the other. Murdoch strongly rejects this view, since\nthe benevolent sentiment and motive does not guarantee an\nunderstanding of the other\u2019s reality and well-being.\n5.4 Moral realism, fact and value, practical reason\n\nMurdoch\u2019s form of moral realism has spurred important and\ninfluential secondary literature that is more engaged than Murdoch\nherself with meta-ethical questions in the Anglo American tradition.\nHilary Putnam credits Murdoch with the critique he develops of the\nfact/value dichotomy, focusing on what Murdoch calls \u201csecondary\nmoral words\u201d (IP: 22/317) and \u201cnormative-descriptive\nwords\u201d (IP: 31/325; Putnam 2002: 34\u201335). (Bernard Williams\nlater influentially referred to these as \u201cthick\u201d moral or\nevaluative concepts, such as cruel, rude, brave, courageous, generous,\nelegant [Williams 1985]). These terms possess descriptive content but\nare also evaluative, and often motivational, contrasting with the more\nabstract moral terms \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and\n\u201cought\u201d that had dominated British moral philosophy\nthrough the 1950s, and that almost entirely lack the descriptive\nelement. For Putnam there are evaluative facts (\u201cJane\u2019s\nact was courageous\u201d) that have no less standing as describing\nreality than a presumptively non-evaluative fact. Nor, he argues, can\nthe reality reflected in the characterization be factored into two\nunrelated components joined together\u2014an allegedly \u201cpurely\ndescriptive\u201d component, and an evaluation of the content in that\ncomponent\n (point 1 on the Hare list).\n The two dimensions are inextricably \u201centangled\u201d, Putnam\nargues (2002).\n\nThis view thus rejects a common moral non-cognitivist (but shared by\nsome cognitivists) claim that moral properties always\n\u201csupervene\u201d on (that is, apply in virtue of)\nalready-existing non-moral properties. Panizza and Setiya defend this\nimplication of the existence of secondary moral terms (Panizza 2020;\nSetiya 2013). Panizza connects the rejection of supervenience with\nMurdoch\u2019s view that our direct perception of moral properties is\nbound up with the ways that perception is deeply conceptual (Panizza\n2020: 284\u20135; see also Setiya 2013).\n\nOthers have focused more distinctly on Murdoch\u2019s view\u2019s\nimplications for practical reason. John McDowell developed a\nMurdochian-influenced moral realist view, in an influential 1979 paper\n\u201cVirtue and Reason\u201d, often also regarded as a founding\nessay in the contemporary virtue ethics tradition (and indeed McDowell\nsees his view [developed in other papers as well] as both Aristotelian\nand Murdochian) (McDowell 1979, 1998). (More on Murdoch and virtue\nbelow.)\n\nMcDowell says that to possess a virtue, such as kindness, is to\npossess \u201ca reliable sensitivity to a certain sort of requirement\nwhich situations impose on behavior\u201d. Its \n\n\ndeliverances\u2026are cases of knowledge\u2026 [A] kind person\nknows what it is like to be confronted with a requirement of kindness.\nThe sensitivity is, we might say, a sort of perceptual capacity.\n(McDowell 1979 [1997: 142]) \n\n\nMcDowell adds that the reasons for action in particular situations\nthat moral perception cognizes cannot be derived from general\nprinciples but retain a particularistic dimension, also emphasized by\nMurdoch. (See \u201cparticularity\u201d below.)\n\nSetiya agrees with McDowell that for Murdoch reality as accurately\ncognized supplies agents with motivating reasons, including moral\nreasons, for action; this view thus constitutes a form of \u201cmoral\ninternalism\u201d. \u201cRationality belongs to full cognition of\nthe facts\u201d (Setiya 2013: 13). Setiya responds to the objection\nthat a moral agent could apply a moral concept competently to a\nsituation but be unmoved by the moral force of the thus-characterized\nsituation. He notes that Murdoch speaks of \n\n two senses of \u201cknowing what a word means\u201d, one\nconnected with ordinary language and the other very much less so. (IP:\n29/322) \n\n\nThe second sense is the deeper understanding on which her moral\nrealism relies. And the deeper understanding can be both of a concept\nand of an individual person in the situation to which the concept is\nbeing applied (Setiya 2013: 9). Murdoch connects these points to an\naspect of her perfectionism, implying the ideal of perfect\nunderstanding of both individuals and concepts.\n\nBut Setiya disagrees with McDowell\u2019s view that the moral reality\ncognized by the moral agent must take the form of moral requirements\nand indeed, more broadly, with action-guiding features of situations\n(Setiya 2013: 11). Mylonaki criticizes McDowell on similar grounds and\nboth she and Setiya take the \u201cother persons\u201d view of the\nmoral reality Murdoch is concerned with (Mylonaki 2019; Setiya 2013:\n11a). Mylonaki emphasizes, however, that cognizing that reality can\ngive rise to reasons for action.\n5.5 Moral reality as metaphysics\n\nA final thread in Murdoch\u2019s view of reality is that it is what\nmetaphysics describes. She understands metaphysics as an\nall-encompassing view of a transcendent reality, of the universe, that\nthe individual must then attempt to come to understand in order to\nwork out her place in it (M&E 1957/EM: 70). In \u201cMetaphysics\nand Ethics\u201d she mentions Thomism, Hegelianism, and Marxism as\nexamples. These metaphysical systems and pictures are deeply ethical\nand evaluative, but, she implies, also provide a broader conception of\nreality. In her 1950s essays, she defends metaphysical thinking not so\nmuch as true, as capturing reality, but as a coherent way of thinking\nabout the moral endeavor of life that is excluded by the linguistic\nturn in philosophical ethics, and which thereby refutes (Hare\u2019s)\nuniversal prescriptivism\u2019s claim to be the sole moral theory\nconsistent with \u201cthe language of morals\u201d. She is\nsympathetic to some moral, political, and philosophical/analytic\ncriticisms of metaphysical systems (especially that they can lose a\nsense of the value of the individual [M&E 1957/EM: 70; Antonaccio\n1996: 115f], and an acknowledgment of ultimate contingency [MGM 1992:\n490]). Nevertheless, her evolving moral views always leave room for\nsome kind of transcendent structure beyond the individual that retains\nethical authority over the moral agent. The title of her final\nsummative work, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals, expresses\nthis continuing role for metaphysics in her thinking about morality\nand reality. As Diamond argues, she is not thinking of\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d as a non-morally-informed enterprise, as it\nis sometimes understood. In that form, Diamond says, Murdoch would not\nthink it positioned to dictate what possibilities are open to moral\nphilosophy (Diamond 2010). A metaphysics of actual reality cannot\navoid being morally informed.\n\nThe Platonic strand of moral reality can of course be seen as\nexemplifying the metaphysics strand, but the latter remains a more\ngeneral idea within Murdoch\u2019s complex overall view of moral reality. The\n\u201cother persons\u201d strand seems less metaphysical and thus\ncontrary to the final strand. But Murdoch often speaks of the reality\nof other people in \u201ctranscendental\u201d\nterms\u2014transcending the individual ego\u2014and this framing\nthereby retains an element important to her complex and shifting\nunderstanding of metaphysics. All three strands play a role in\nMurdoch\u2019s thinking about (moral) reality, but the other persons\nand the Good are distinctly more prominent.\n5.6 Metaphor\n\nIn addition to but interwoven with the differences mentioned, other\npersons, the Good, and metaphysics (or a particular metaphysical\nsystem or concept) also embody distinct metaphors for understanding\nmoral reality. Murdoch often emphasizes the importance of metaphor in\nthinking, especially in philosophy where, in the analytic tradition,\nthere is an often tacit assumption that any metaphorical use of\nlanguage can be given a purely literal rendering. Murdoch entirely\nrejects this way of thinking about language and understanding and\noften talks of exploring metaphors. \n\n\nMetaphors are not merely peripheral decorations or even useful models,\nthey are fundamental forms of our awareness of our condition. (SGC:\n77/363, and elsewhere 93f/377) \n\n\nThe \u201cother persons\u201d strand involves an image of a struggle\nof each moral agent to grasp the other person(s) in their particular\nworld as distinct persons, as equally real as themselves. The metaphor\nof Good involves a reaching to an abstract and implied-to-be\n\u201chigher\u201d entity. The metaphor of \u201cmetaphysics\u201d\ngenerally evokes an elaborated system within which the individual\nagent is placed. The metaphorical dimension (with the differences\namong the three) is integral to our understanding of each strand.\n6. Moral Agency as Inner Activity\n\nMurdoch\u2019s form of moral realism has influenced a critique of the\nfact/value dichotomy; the development of a virtue-ethical form of\nmoral realism focused on right-making characteristics prompting acts\nin the public world; and, more generally, debates about practical\nreason and reasons for action. But the significance of Murdoch\u2019s\nphilosophy, and in particular of her version of moral realism, for an\nunderstanding of morality significantly transcends those\ncontributions. (Setiya recognizes that Murdoch herself is barely\ninterested in reason or rationality [Setiya 2013], though she does\nvery occasionally talk about reasons. She would not regard \u201cpractical\nrationality\u201d as a welcome framework for her thought, even if her\ninsights have bearing on what is currently understood by that notion.\nShe says, in promotion of both her perfectionism and love\nas a central ethical concept, \u201c\u2018Act lovingly\u2019 will\ntranslate \u2018Act perfectly\u2019 whereas \u2018Act\nrationally\u2019 will not\u201d [IP: 102/384].) Bakhurst argues that\nMurdoch\u2019s moral realism is a substantive moral view, not a\nmeta-ethical view as McDowell\u2019s is (a rejection of\n point 7,\n that philosophers can and should propound morally neutral views of\nmorality) (Bakhurst 2020:\n 218).[4]\n\nWe may focus on two such contributions to moral philosophy connected\nto Murdoch\u2019s moral realism: (A) an expanded conception of moral\nagency; (B) the notion of a \u201cfabric of ethical being\u201d.\n\nOn (A), Murdoch delineates a broader notion of moral agency than that\ninvolved in reasons internalism and the perception of or sensitivity\nto action-guiding reasons within situations. She seeks to demonstrate\na form of moral agency that takes place solely in the mind of the\nagent with no expression in her behavior in the public world. She does\nso through an extended example in IP, which serves other purposes as\nwell (especially the importance of the inner life for morality,\nagainst\n point 5\n [the inner life is not very important for morality]), and is\nextensively cited in the secondary literature. The example is of\nM, the mother-in-law of D. Throughout D\u2019s\nmarriage to M\u2019s son, M has viewed D as\n\u201cpert and familiar, insufficiently ceremonious, brusque,\nsometimes positively rude, always tiresomely juvenile\u201d. She\nfeels her son has \u201cmarried beneath him\u201d (IP: 17/312).\nM behaves toward D without revealing her real opinions\nand feelings. Murdoch highlights this feature by imagining that\nD moves away or dies, and that M therefore comes to have\nno opportunity to engage in behavior directed at D.\n\nM settles into her fixed picture of D. But something\nprompts her to reflect on her view, recognizing both her jealousy of\nD and her own snobbishness. She tries to look at the D\nshe knew in a new way, and over time, as the result of her attempts to\nsee D anew, her view of D changes. \n\n\nD is discovered to be not vulgar but refreshingly simple, not\nundignified but spontaneous\u2026not tiresomely juvenile but\ndelightfully youthful. (IP: 17\u201318/313)\n\n\nMurdoch imagines that M\u2019s new view of D is\naccurate and truthful, recognizing that it need not be. Murdoch sees\nM\u2019s attempts to see D as exemplifying activity on\nM\u2019s part, though issuing in no outward behavior, activity\nthat is moral in character. Murdoch concludes that our moral agency is\nnot exhausted by our outward behavior, nor by outward behavior plus\nmental acts conceptually tied to outward behavior, like deciding,\nchoosing, and deliberating. And the moral philosophy of her time did\nnot leave any clear place for this purely inner moral activity of\nattention.\n7. The Fabric of Moral Being\n\n(B) Beyond her expansion of moral agency to include inner mental life,\nMurdoch proposes the notion of a person\u2019s total moral being,\nwhich transcends agency itself. In discussing M she says that\nher inner mental acts of attention contribute to \u201ca continuous\nfabric of being\u201d (IP: 22/316) that she says \n\n\nis shown in their mode of speech or silence, their choice of words,\ntheir assessment of others, their conception of their own life, what\nthey think attractive or praiseworthy, what they think funny. (VCM\n1956/EM: 80f) \n\n\nIn discussing the fabric of being idea, Diamond refers to\n\u201cthoughts, jokes, patterns of attention, fantasies, imaginative\nexplorations, and a thousand other things\u201d (Diamond 2010: 72.\nSee also Crary 2007: 47). In Metaphysics Murdoch says\n\u201cMorality is and ought to be connected with the whole of our\nbeing\u201d. (MGM 1992: 495).\n\nMurdoch is saying that our thoughts, modes of speech, emotions,\nimaginings, contemplatings, and the like, are responses to our\nperceived reality, just as the exercise of moral agency is. If we are\namused by someone making fun of a disabled person, that is part of our\nmoral being; it reflects on us morally. Such responses are part of us,\nbut are not always doings, exercisings of agency.\n\nThis metaphor of the fabric of being connects with Murdoch\u2019s\nsaying that morality is \n\n\nsomething that goes on continually, not something that is switched off\nin between the occurrence of explicit moral choices. (IP: 37/329) \n\n\na key criticism of\n point 4\n (morality consists fundamentally in choice-making in specifiable\nsituations). We are in a constant state of moral formation,\nand we bring our fabric of being to (what we experience as) choice\nsituations. Actions and other responses flow from the background\nfabric of being that has been constructed by this moral formation.\nThis metaphor also connects with Murdoch\u2019s defense of the moral\nimportance of the inner life, of the individual\u2019s consciousness,\nthat is ignored or demoted in the moral philosophy of her time\n (point 5),\n a development she thinks due partly to a partial misunderstanding of\nWittgenstein\u2019s emphasis on public criteria for the meaning of\nconcepts (IP 1970, e.g., 15/311; Wiseman 2020).\n8. Seeing Replaces Doing\n\nNevertheless, it is not entirely clear how Murdoch is envisioning the\nmoral formation that constructs the fabric of moral being. This\nunclarity emerges in Murdoch\u2019s substituting seeing for\ndoing as the core metaphor for human life\u2019s most\nfundamental moral task. Her influential essay \u201cThe Idea of\nPerfection\u201d is framed as a critique of Stuart Hampshire on this\npoint. She sees Hampshire as articulating the most powerful case for\nplacing action-in-the-world at the core of the moral enterprise. She\nsuggests an alternative conception that uses a range of visual\nmetaphors such as see, attention, perception, looking, and vision to\nexpress the fundamental task of morality. Her visual metaphors are\ndefinitely meant to retain an important place for action in the world,\nbut to place it in a larger context than does Hampshire\u2019s\n\u201cdoing\u201d metaphor (see Moran 2012: 189). They thereby\nexpress the limitations of the practical reasoning approach to\nunderstanding Murdoch\u2019s moral philosophy.\n\nIn particular, Murdoch employs \u201cattention\u201d (not entirely\nconsistently) to mark the process by which this successful\napprehension of reality\u2014seeing\u2014is brought about. \n\n\nI have used the word \u201cattention\u201d which I borrow from\nSimone Weil, to express the idea of a just and loving gaze directed\nupon an individual reality. I believe this to be the\ncharacteristic and proper mark of the moral agent. (IP: 34/327;\nemphasis added)\n\n9. Simone Weil\n\nBefore discussing Murdoch\u2019s notion of attention, some remarks\nabout Weil are in order, because of her profound impact on Murdoch,\nnot only in relation to attention. Simone Weil (1909\u20131943) was a\nFrench philosopher (though never a university professor), political\nactivist, and, in her later (short) life a kind of Christian mystic.\nMurdoch encountered Weil\u2019s writings in the early 1950s, and\nreviewed her Notebooks in 1956 (\u201cKnowing the\nVoid\u201d). Murdoch mentions her only briefly in her earlier\nwritings; Weil, unlike Sartre, was not a figure at all familiar to\nBritish philosophy of those years, and indeed she is still little\nknown to Anglo-American philosophers (see the Stanford Encyclopedia entry on\n Simone Weil).\n But as in the quote above, Murdoch always makes her debt to Weil\nevident. Weil influenced Murdoch\u2019s turn to Platonism, and her\nparticular interpretation of Plato. She certainly bolstered the\ncontinuing Christian elements in Murdoch\u2019s thought, as well as\nMurdoch\u2019s increasing invoking of mysticism as related to\nmorality, especially in Metaphysics. She probably influenced\nMurdoch\u2019s view of psychic energy (understood on a Freudian\nmodel) as \u201cmechanical\u201d, something to which we are\nsubjected. And Murdoch made use of Weil\u2019s notion of\n\u201cvoid\u201d as part her moral outlook in\nMetaphysics.\n\nWeil also developed a quite original critique of Marxism that involved\na strong emphasis on the dignity of manual work, an emphasis of\nMurdoch\u2019s also, in her important political essay, \u201cHouse\nof Theory\u201d, from 1958. Murdoch refers to Weil frequently in\nMetaphysics, though only once in any sustained way. In 1976\nshe cited Weil\u2019s Attente de Dieu (Waiting for\nGod) as one of only three philosophical works that deeply\ninfluenced her. (The others are Plato\u2019s Symposium and\nKierkegaard\u2019s Fear and Trembling [Broackes 2012a: 17,\nnote 42].)\n\nBut Weil\u2019s strongest influence on Murdoch was in the idea of\nattention (Weil 1942 [1977]; 1973b). Weil\u2019s view of attention\nhad a strong religious dimension. The proper, ultimate object of\nattention is God, though persons and subject matters are also objects\nof attention. Weil\u2019s notion of attention also involves a kind of\npassive waiting in readiness for a truth to be revealed, an emptying\nof oneself in preparation for receiving the object. Murdoch abandoned\nthe religious aspect of Weil\u2019s view of attention, as she also\nabandoned for herself the distinctly theistic aspects of Weil\u2019s\nChristianity, and also adopted a more active conception of attention\nthan Weil.  (Forsberg argues that Murdoch\u2019s view was closer to\nWeil\u2019s regarding passivity/activity [Forsberg 2017]. See also\nCordner 2016.)  But their notions were otherwise \n similar.[5]\n\n10. Murdoch on Attention\n\nFor Murdoch, attention involves activity on our part (more so than in\nWeil), directing the \u201cjust and loving gaze upon an individual\nreality\u201d, as M\u2019s attempt to see D is meant\nto illustrate. Sometimes Murdoch suggests that seeing someone justly\nand lovingly is precisely what is involved in seeing them as they\nreally are [IP: 28/321; OGG: 67/354].\n\nBut Murdoch does not regard mere accuracy as constituting this just\nand loving gaze (IP: 23/317). Learning more details about someone\n(that they like chocolate or are afraid of snakes) is not what\nattention as loving and just provides (Cordner 2016). Moreover, as\nillustrated by the character of Julius King in her novel Fairly\nHonorable Defeat, someone can be very perceptive, very tuned into\naspects of other people\u2019s reality, such as their vanity, and can\nuse this knowledge to manipulate and harm those persons. Julius indeed\nis incapable of loving others at all, and his perceptiveness might\ninvolve accurate, but not just or loving, attention (FHD 1970).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Murdoch thinks that fully recognizing and\nacknowledging that a given other person is as real as oneself does not\ncome naturally to us. Our fantasies and self-absorption get in the\nway; getting past these obstacles is difficult and uncertain and\nconstitutes a genuine moral achievement. Attention is the process by\nwhich we are potentially enabled to do so.\n\nThe \u201cas real as oneself\u201d formulation may be meant to\ncapture two somewhat distinct strands in Murdoch\u2019s view. One is\nthe recognition of the other in her distinct otherness and difference\nfrom oneself, rather than in light of one\u2019s projections onto the\nother that assimilate her to oneself. The second is that the other is\nseen as like oneself, for example as a human being, a person, a\npossessor of dignity. (Murdoch implies but does not articulate this second\nstrand.) Murdoch wants both these strands in what constitutes a moral\ntake on the other, and \u201cjust and loving attention\u201d, even\nif it does not seem equivalent to \u201cappreciating that others are\nas real as oneself\u201d, should probably be understood as\nencompassing both. (Chappell adds a third strand, what it is like to\nbe that other person [Chappell 2018: 103].)\n\nAttention is thus a process by which human persons are enabled to\naccess moral reality. The process is both cognitive and perceptual\n(Murdoch does not attempt to work out their relationship to one\nanother) but for Murdoch those capacities are also moral in character.\nOur moral capacities are part of our cognitive capacities,\nenabling, and required for us to see, the moral and evaluative aspects\nof\n reality.[6]\n10.1 Care ethics, feminism, and particularity\n Murdoch\u2019s (and through her, Weil\u2019s) view of (loving)\nattention as the core moral capacity influenced the development of\ncare ethics, especially in its early (and continuing) form as a type\nof feminist ethical outlook (Gilligan 1982; Noddings 1984; Grimshaw\n1986; Ruddick 1989; Walker 1989; Bowden 1997). Care ethics emphasizes\nattentiveness and concern for the other person in her particularity,\ninformed by knowledge of the specific needs, desires, and situation of\nthat other person, in contrast to emphasizing a universal category\nsuch as \u201cperson\u201d or \u201chuman being\u201d as the\nappropriate target of attention and care. Murdoch\u2019s emphasis on\nthe reality of the particular other as the target of loving attention\nwas drawn on to develop this form of ethical theory.\n\nIn addition both care ethics and Murdoch tend to see personal\nrelationships as the primary domain of morality. Murdoch\u2019s focus\non personal fantasy as a prime obstacle to grasping the other\u2019s\nreality suggests that she is envisioning persons with whom we have a\npersonal relationship. But her language sometimes suggests a broader\nscope, perhaps to persons known to oneself but with whom one does not\nhave a personal relationship, or even the broader category of persons\none encounters in a fleeting way (e.g., fellow riders on the subway).\nShe seldom suggests that it means needy or suffering persons distant\nfrom oneself, or members of a general category (e.g., victims of\nCovid). Something like that idea surfaces only in\nMetaphysics, where Murdoch associates it with\nutilitarianism.\n\nVarieties of care ethics arose to encompass less personal forms of\nrelationship, and some also expanded this focus to take account of\ninstitutions and structures in which care relationships do, or should,\ntake place (Tronto 1993; Bowden 1997; Norlock 2019). Murdoch never goes in this\ninstitutional direction. At the same time, the centrality of the\nvisual metaphor in Murdoch\u2014attention, seeing, looking,\nvision\u2014does not sit comfortably with the emphasis in much care\nethics, especially in its feminist form, on the sustaining of ongoing\npersonal relationships involving mutuality and reciprocity, and more\ngenerally on the fundamentally relational character of the self. The\nattentive self is not portrayed by Murdoch as actively engaging with\nthe attended-to other in a reciprocal relationship. In\nMetaphysics, she actively defends the standing-apart of the\nmoral subject against the engaged relationality present in the Jewish\ntheologian Martin Buber\u2019s views (MGM 1992, ch 15: 361\u2013380.\nSee Cordner 2019 discussion). (Murdoch\u2019s overall relationship to\nfeminism is complex. For extended treatments, see Lovibond 2011;\nBolton forthcoming).\n10.2 Particularity and particularism\n\nOne Murdochian strand in care ethics that has been influential outside\nthe care ethics context is particularity\u2014an emphasis on the\nlimits of universal principle and impersonality to capture the\nsubstance of appropriate moral response. This particularity takes two\nforms, or at least two emphases, one on the particularity of\nsituations\u2014the (alleged) impossibility of coming up with a set\nof general moral principles or a moral code that will always prescribe\nthe right action (McDowell\u2019s emphasis, and the focus of what is\ncalled \u201cparticularism\u201d [Hooker & Little 2000]). The\nother is on the particularity of persons as objects of moral attention\nand concern. (There are other typologies of particularism. See Driver\n2012.) Both dimensions are present in Murdoch\u2019s thought and in\ncare ethics, and the person-focus is more central to both Murdoch and\ncare ethics. Millgram finds a resource for particularism in\nMurdoch\u2019s emphasis on finding the best description of a\nsituation (Millgram 2002), but situation-particularity remains within\nthe \u201caction/reasons for action\u201d framework that Murdoch\ndefinitively transcends, and person-particularity is crucial for her\ndoing so.\n10.3 Obstacles to loving attention\n\nFor Murdoch, just and loving attention, seeing the other as equally\nreal as oneself is a difficult and infrequent moral achievement. She\ndelineates three different stages involving attention, each yielding\nobstacles to its realization. First, an agent may fail to notice that\nan effort of attention is called for. As Murdoch says, \u201cI can\nonly choose within the world I can see\u201d (IP: 37/329). What we\nnotice, what registers with us, is an integral part of our fabric of\nmoral being. If an agent fails to see a morally relevant feature of a\nperson nearby (e.g., their distress), this feature will not become\npart of her subjectively perceived world and she will not even attempt\nto focus on this other person as part of an attempt at proffering just\nand loving attention.\n\nBut even if she does notice the morally relevant feature of the other\nand decides to make that attempt, as for example M does with\nrespect to D, she may not be able to do so. Because of\nfantasies and resentments toward the other, or just self-absorption,\nthe moral agent may simply not be capable of focusing on the other\nperson beyond a very superficial level. She may genuinely try, but end\nup with the wrong target occupying her mind.\n\nThird, even if the agent is able to direct her attention to the other\nperson, she may be unsuccessful in making that attention a just and\nloving take on that other person. Try as she might with all sincerity\n(which she is unable to muster at the second stage) her fantasies\nabout that other person, and her fabric of being more generally, may\nkeep her from seeing the other as she really is.\n\nNotice that \u201cattention\u201d is used in two different ways in\nthis account. The first is focusing on another as part of an\nattempt to proffer just and loving attention. (Call this\n\u201cattempt attention\u201d, attention in its mode as an attempt\nat just and loving attention). The second is successfully\nproffering such just and loving attention. (Call this \u201csuccess\nattention\u201d, attention in its mode as a successful attempt.)\n\nOnly if the three hurdles are cleared has the agent achieved the\nsuccess attention that Murdoch thinks morality demands. Various\naspects of the agent\u2019s fabric of ethical being can prevent that\nmoral achievement.\n11. Murdoch\u2019s Focus on the Active Dimension of Moral Formation\n\nWe must therefore look more closely into how Murdoch understands moral\nformation, the creation of agents\u2019 fabric of ethical being. She\nsays that over time our attendings (another term for attempt\nattention) build up the (subjective) structures of value that largely\nconstitute our fabric of being. \n\n\n[I]f we consider what the work of attention is like, how continuously\nit goes on, and how imperceptibly it builds up the structures of value\nround about us\u2026; (IP: 37/329) \n\n[O]ur ability to act well \u201cwhen the time comes\u201d depends\npartly, perhaps largely, upon the quality of our habitual objects of\nattention. (OGG: 56/345; see also 67/354, 69/356,\n 91f/375)[7]\n\n\nMurdoch is implying that by our efforts of attending to various\nobjects (attempt attention), especially other persons, bringing them\ninto our active mental universe, we build up the evaluative structures\nof our subjectively experienced or perceived world, and create our\nfabric of ethical being. This sets the stage for attempts at loving\nattention and (less frequent) successes in proffering such loving\nattention.\n\nBut the idea that our fabric of being and subjective structures of\nvalue are built up almost solely or even primarily through acts of\nattempt attention seems at odds with Murdoch\u2019s\nFreudian/Kantian/Schopenhauerian moral psychology, which implies that\nthe main forces creating our fabric of being are fantasies, other\ndistortions, and egoistic desires infrequently aligned with moral ways\nof being. These do indeed build up structures of value and ways of\nperceiving reality. They are not merely forces operating in a\nmechanical way on the agent\u2019s will, pulling her away from moral\naction and perception, although this dualistic image is one Murdoch\noften employs for the human psyche. But the values and ways of\nperceiving built up by these forces are usually morally bad or at\nleast unworthy. An example from Murdoch\u2019s novels is Julius King,\nthe character referred to earlier, who sees many other persons in a\nparticular way, contemptuously\u2014Murdoch somewhat implies that he\nis morally damaged from being a concentration camp survivor\u2014and\noften treats his acquaintances and even friends in a malicious and\ncontemptuous way, arising from the valuational framework (part of his\nfabric of ethical being) within which he views them (FHD 1970).\nAlthough Murdoch\u2019s predominant view of the psyche implies that\negoistic forces do much to create our fabric of being, within which\nour capability for success attention comprises but a weak reed, she\ndoes not actually adopt this view. Rather she takes the view that our\nactive, deliberate attendings (attempt attention) are the prime source\nof our subjective structures of value and fabric of moral being.\n\nThus Murdoch\u2019s stated view privileges what can be seen as the\nactive dimension of value or moral formation, while her theory of the\npsyche should have pointed her (also) toward the passive aspects\nthereof. Cora Diamond suggests that the \u201cfabric of being\u201d\nmetaphor mixes active and passive (Diamond 2010: 72). And in a 1966\nessay, \u201cThe Darkness of Practical Reason\u201d, Murdoch\ncriticizes Hampshire for an overly sharp distinction between passive\naspects of mental life (represented by desires and fears that are not\nthought-dependent) and the active choosing will, aided by\nreason\u2019s surveying the facts of the agent\u2019s situation\nenabled by an active stepping back from that situation, that decides\nand takes action (DPR 1966/EM: 201). She sees (attempt)\nattention, and also imagination, as falling into neither of these\ncategories. So in this particular \u201cactive/passive\u201d\nframework attempt attention does not fall in the \u201cactive\u201d\ncategory.\n\nNevertheless, Murdoch still sees moral agents as in genuine if limited\ncontrol of their attendings. In this sense, attempt attention does\nfall into the \u201cactive\u201d category, thus contrasting with the\naction-centric view of agency and freedom she criticizes in existentialist and analytic moral philosophies and\npsychologies. This attempt attention contrasts with the Freudian\nintrapsychic forces that contribute to our moral formation without\nengaging our agency in that way. And at least in one place she\nrecognizes a form of passivity that is connected with a person\u2019s\nfabric of being, in contrast with aspects of our mental or psychic\nuniverse that are not. In discussing Hampshire, she attributes to him\nrecognition that a Freudian explanation or understanding of, say, a\nfear \n\n\nenables us to attach the fear intelligibly to a more clearly seen\nstructure of motivation which we may endorse or at any rate accept as\nours. (DPR 1966/EM: 196) \n\n\nThis contrasts with a fear that besieges us but whose character we\nrepudiate, or at least do not accept. Thus Murdoch\u2019s view that\nour attendings shape our moral formation and world of perceived values\ndraws on a view of activity reduced in scope from the Hampshirean\nconcept, yet still distinguishable from a form of passivity that she\nrecognizes (at least here) as part of our moral being. It is in this\nsense of \u201cactive\u201d that she privileges the active (attempt\nattendings) over the passive in her explicit account of the formation\nof our fabric of moral being, resulting in the passive dimension not\nreceiving adequate attention (Blum 2012).\n12. The Absence of Social Sources of Negative Moral Formation in Murdoch\u2019s Philosophy\n\nMurdoch\u2019s failure to theorize passive forces in moral formation\nis also expressed in a striking absence of attention to the distinctly\nsocial sources of negative moral formation. An important part\nof how moral formation is, as she says, going on all the time, how our fabric of\nbeing is always being constructed, arises from social rather than\nintrapsychic factors, for example, representations of categories of\npersons that block or hinder agents\u2019 abilities to see the\nreality of persons in those groups. As a member of a given society, or\nparticular subcultures within that society, we are subjected to\nstereotypes and other misleading representations of different groups\nof people, with whom we do or do not come in contact. The stereotypes\nare attached to race, gender, class, religion, national origin, sexual\norientation, age, gender expression, professions and occupations,\nresidence in certain neighborhoods or regions, and other social\ngroups. These \u201cfigurations\u201d, as Diana Meyers usefully\ncalls them, are almost always evaluative in character (Meyers 1994).\nThus they contribute to social agents\u2019 evaluative take on the\nworld and to the formation of their moral being. They affect whether\nwe do, or try to, have loving attention, respect, compassion, and even\nmere acknowledgment toward individual members of those groups. In this\nrespect figurations are comparable to the fantasies and other forms of\negoism that Murdoch points to that block loving attention\u2014except\nthat they affect our responses to people unknown to us much more than\nthese Freudian intrapsychic forces do. Social stereotypes are not the\nonly form of socially-produced barrier to loving attention, but they\nare important and can represent the larger category for our\n purposes.[8]\n\nWe are largely passive with respect to the impact of these figurations\non our moral being, often not even recognizing their existence, as\nrecent work on \u201cimplicit bias\u201d\u2014unconscious ways we\nsee members of particular groups in negative or positive lights (Saul\n& Brownstein\n 2016)\u2014demonstrates.[9]\n We do not generally choose to embrace these figurations of the groups\nin question, nor are they generally (though perhaps they can sometimes\nbe) generated through (attempt) attention towards groups or\nindividuals. If we notice them at all, we often just find ourselves\npossessing them (Blum 2012).\n\nSocial figurations may not clear the bar for contributions to our\nmoral formation that Murdoch sets up in the quote above from DPR. They\nmay seem more like a fear that we do not endorse. Indeed figurations\ncan be a source of such fears, such as a stereotype of black males as\nthreatening, and can function even if the agent has not embraced their\ncognitive content. Murdoch\u2019s notion of \u201cfabric of\nbeing\u201d is never sufficiently defined so as to make entirely\nclear whether any item in our mental universe is actually excluded\nfrom it. But we can rely on an intuitive sense that if a stereotype\nsubstantially affects how the agent perceives and experiences persons\nof group X, and the agent has not attempted to rid herself of\nthe stereotype or neutralize its effect on her, then the stereotype\ncontributes to or is part of her moral being (as a passive\nfactor).\n\nThese social forces, explored by the more recent development of\n\u201csocial epistemology\u201d, complement the intrapsychic ones as\npassive contributors to moral formation. The \u201cgoing on all the\ntime\u201d that constitutes our moral formation and being is a\ncomplex combination of passive and active elements and processes. In\nseveral essays in the late 1950s Murdoch mentions the idea of\n\u201cconvention\u201d, and sometimes sees conventions or\nconventional thinking as a barrier to adequate perception (Holland\n2012). But convention does not capture the idea of distinct\nfigurations of particular groups of persons that are powerful forces\nin the culture and society harming social beings\u2019 ability to see\nthe reality of members of those specific groups. These obstacles have\nan entirely different source than the intrapsychic forces with which\nMurdoch is concerned (Clarke 2012: 244f; Blum 2012). The two can\ncomplement and interact, as M\u2019s class-based snobbery\nmakes common cause with her jealousy of D to cast the latter in\nthe negative light that Murdoch describes. There is strong support in\nMurdoch\u2019s writing for Nussbaum\u2019s claim that \n\n\nMurdoch seems almost entirely to lack interest in the political and\nsocial determinants of a moral vision and in the larger social\ncritique that ought\u2026to be a major element in the struggle\nagainst one\u2019s own defective tendencies. (Nussbaum 2001: 32) \n\n\nThis is not, however, to deny Clarke\u2019s point that\nMurdoch\u2019s view of attention and moral perception leave room for\nself-reflective criticism within which such a social critique could be\nlodged (Clarke 2012). But the point is not only that Murdoch neglects\nsocial and political factors in moral formation but that her\nprivileging of the active and neglecting the passive is a theoretical\nunderpinning of this neglect.\n\nMurdoch\u2019s stated view that our attempt attention is the\nvirtually sole source of our fabric of being suggests an ambiguity in\nwhat she means when she says that morality or moral life is\n\u201csomething that goes on continually\u201d (IP: 37/329), not\nonly in moments of actional choice. She definitely means that\nmoral activity is going on all the time, a view connected\nwith her expanding the domain of \u201cactivity\u201d beyond its\nconventional understanding as the public world of action, to include\nthe inner life. She wants to say that in between public act-and-choice\nsituations we are continually active mentally in our attempt attention\nand our imagination.\n\nBut she also wants to say that the moral formation that\nproduces our fabric of being is going on all the time. This opens up\nthe larger issue of the range of factors that contribute to moral\nformation, beyond attempt attention. Murdoch may partly be blinded to\nthe passive forces in this category by a failure to keep clearly\ndistinct the claims that moral activity goes on continually and that\nmoral formation goes on continually. But her vital moral insight of\nthe \u201cfabric of being\u201d metaphor requires taking account of\nthe full range of contributions to that fabric of being, passive as well as active.\n13. Moral Seeing as a Spiritual Achievement vs. the Unreflective Good, Non-Egoistic Person\n\nMurdoch generally presents seeing moral reality as a difficult and\nlengthy mental, emotional, and spiritual achievement, never able to be\nfully accomplished. The defeat or transcendence of the ego is\nsomething the agent must continually work at. This idea of a spiritual\njourney toward moral seeing looms even larger in Metaphysics.\nHowever, Murdoch also wants to leave room for rare persons for whom\nappreciating the Good and the reality of other people is not achieved\nprimarily through struggle and challenge. As she says in a oft-quoted\npassage, \u201c[I]t must be possible to do justice to both Socrates\nand the virtuous peasant\u201d (IP: 2/300). (The latter is not an\nauspicious formulation, as \u201cpeasants\u201d, even if uneducated,\ncan still be reflective and intentional in seeking the Good.) Murdoch\nfollows Schopenhauer, an important historical figure for her, in\nmarveling at meeting that rare someone in whom \u201cthe anxious\navaricious tentacles of the self\u201d, so ubiquitous in human nature,\nare absent [SGC: 103/385]. Of course, this is not to deny that any\nvirtuous person must sometimes have to suppress anti-moral desire, or\nto struggle to see other persons in their full reality. Even if the\ndifference is one of degree, the \u201cconstant struggle\u201d image\nis quite different from the virtuous peasant, and Murdoch wants to\nleave room for both.\n14. Virtue\n\nMurdoch speaks often of virtue, and she has been treated as an early\nvirtue theorist. Her Sovereignty essays were given exposure\nby inclusion in some early and canonical virtue ethics collections\n(MacIntyre & Hauerwas 1983; Crisp & Slote 1997). While she may\nwell have helped spur interest in virtue within moral philosophy, she\nis not a virtue theorist. She is not putting forward a view that\nvirtue is a more fundamental moral concept than other concepts, nor is\nshe claiming that approaching right action through the lens of virtue\nis superior to doing so through a Kantian/deontological or utilitarian\napproach. She does not offer an \u201cethical theory\u201d in either\nof these senses. Her invocation of virtue reflects an unsystematized\nrecognition that virtue is part of the toolbox we use to understand\nthe moral domain of life, as are attention, perception, love,\nunselfishness, and (in Metaphysics) duty. She joined with\nvirtue theory in helping to expand the scope of ethics beyond\nprocedures and principles of right action to include how it is good to\nlive and to be (against\n point 5).\n15. Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals\n15.1 Duty\n\nIt is not possible to provide a full discussion of Metaphysics as\na Guide to Morals in this entry, nor of Murdoch\u2019s evolving\nviews on art and literature, religion, politics, concepts, and the\nnature of philosophy, all of which bear on her view of morality. When\nMetaphysics treats issues of morality, most of what it says\nis in the spirit of her earlier moral writings, or extends it, though\nsometimes quite significantly. There is a great deal more emphasis in\nMetaphysics on purification of the individual\nconsciousness\u2014purifying it of its egoism\u2014and the Platonic\n\u201cascent\u201d to that purification, as a core moral task; but\nthat idea is present in Sovereignty also. She also much more\nfrequently connects morality with mysticism, spirituality, and\nreligion. She also retains the idea that we construct our moral world\nthrough mental activity, but in Metaphysics she sometimes\nshifts that activity from attention to Eros, or energy (\u201c[W]e\nare always deploying and directing our energy, refining or\nblunting it, purifying or corrupting it\u201d. [MGM 1992: 495;\nemphasis in original]), and sometimes to imagination (MGM 1992:\n322).\n\nHowever, in Metaphysics Murdoch amends her moral philosophy\nin one quite substantial way. She now thinks the moral life cannot do\nwithout duty, and that duty is not simply an expression of moral\nvision or attention. She says that there are several different\n\u201cmodes of ethical being\u201d besides moral\nvision/attention/Eros/purification, that co-exist with it in a larger\n\u201cfield of force\u201d, involving tension between the different\nmodes (MGM 1992: 492). Duty is the most important of these. Her\nconception of duty is like Kant\u2019s in certain respects and\ncontrary to it in others.\n\nDuties, as Kant said, present absolute moral requirements. They are\navailable as a bridle on contrary inclination without being routed\nthrough the individual\u2019s moral sensibility. They can thereby\n\u201cintroduce order and calmness\u201d (MGM 1992: 494). They do\nnot leave room for flexibility of interpretation by the agent\u2019s\nmoral character (Hopwood 2019: 250).\n\nBut, contra Kant, duties are unsystematic, not necessarily connected\nwith one another. The reason for not lying is different from that for\nnot stealing. They are not all expressions of a more general principle\nor procedure, like the categorical imperative. Murdoch recognizes but\nrejects Schopenhauer\u2019s and Wittgenstein\u2019s view that\n\u201cduty\u201d, especially when viewed (as Murdoch does), as an\nunconnected \u201clist\u201d, is a holdover from a theological view\n\u201cas arbitrary orders given by God\u201d (MGM 1992: 301f,\n303).\n\nMurdoch is aware that this conception of duty applies more fully to\n\u201cnegative duties\u201d than positive ones.\n\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t lie\u2019 is a clearer command\nthan \u2018be truthful\u2019\u201d (MGM 1992: 302). However,\nalthough the latter does not have the clarity of direction of the\nformer, both possess an immediate availability to the agent.\n\nMurdoch also rejects Kant\u2019s view that duty is the whole of\nmorality, as she rejects Schopenhauer\u2019s view that morality can\nrest solely on compassion and eschew duty (MGM 1992: 292).\nPurification of consciousness remains the \u201cfundamental\n\u2018arena\u2019\u201d of morality (MGM 1992: 293). The\n\u201cdutiful man\u201d may be \u201ccontent with too\nlittle\u201d, following a rule without imagining that more is\nrequired (MGM 1992: 494), more that must arise from another mode of\nethical being.\n\nMurdoch recognizes something like dutiful action in\nSovereignty, when she speaks of everyday acts that we perform\nsimply as any moral agent, and for publicly obvious reasons [IP:\n43/334]. But there she does not frame these actions as\n\u201cduty\u201d as she develops that notion in MGM, but as\nexpressions of moral perception. In Sovereignty she lacks the\nidea that \u201cthe concept of duty remains with us as a steady moral\nforce\u201d (MGM 1992: 494).\n15.2 Axioms\n\nThe notion of duty is connected with a third \u201cmode of moral\nbeing\u201d, part of the field of force constituted by all these\nmodes, that she calls \u201caxioms\u201d. Axioms are roughly the\npolitical counterpart of duties, the latter understood as operating in\nthe terrain of personal behavior (Antonaccio 2000: 159). Axioms are\n(relatively) fixed and unavoidable constraints and requirements\ngoverning behavior in the political domain. Like duties, they do not\nform a system, but are distinct in their individual character, as\nillustrated by Murdoch\u2019s most frequent example of an axiom-type,\nthat of rights. She mentions, for example, the right to happiness, the\nright to vote, rights animals have (presumably not to be made to\nsuffer), and the rights of women. Even if all are rights, they have\ndifferent valuational characters. Axioms operate by being regarded as\nreadily understood unconditional and inviolable standards, and so can\nbe invoked and expect to be honored (Browning 2019: 185).\n\nIn contrast to (though not strictly incompatible with) what she says\nabout duties, axioms are historical products, and this is connected\nwith their being unsystematic and piecemeal. Women\u2019s coming to\nbe seen as having equal rights with men might not have happened, but\nit did, and now (Murdoch thinks) equal rights for women has the status\nof an axiom. Axioms are products of genuine, if historically\ncontingent, moral insight.\n\nIn MGM, Murdoch sees the individual-moral and the political\ndomains as governed by very different norms and principles, each\nneeding to be protected from too much influence from the other. \n\n\nLiberal political thought posits a certain fundamental distinction\nbetween the person as citizen and the person as moral-spiritual\nindividual. (MGM 1992: 357) \n\n\nShe sees the individual-moral domain (notably excluding duty) as\ngoverned by a \u2018perfectionism\u2019 that is continuous from\nSovereignty to Metaphysics. The aspiration to the\nhighest moral goodness is the proper aim of the human person. By\ncontrast, the polity cannot be \u2018perfected\u2019; its proper aim\nis to be \u2018decent\u2019 (MGM 1992: 356), to try to limit the\nevil contained therein (MGM 1992: 368, from Simone Weil). This view is\na radical departure from Murdoch\u2019s political thinking in her\nfascinating 1958 essay, \u201cA House of Theory\u201d, her only\npre-Metaphysics political philosophy writing. There, and in\noccasional remarks in Sovereignty, Murdoch sees moral ideas\nand ideals as the appropriate normative source for sociopolitical\narrangements\u2014for example, as in \u201cHouse\u201d, the ideas\nof dignity in work, and the communal bonds of work. In\nMetaphysics this view is largely (not entirely) rejected\n(Blum forthcoming).\n\nThough, in contrast to duties and moral vision, axioms concern the\npolitical rather than the individual-moral realm, Murdoch conceives of\nthem as part of the fabric of moral being. They bear on individual\nconduct through the individual\u2019s status as a citizen, wherein we\nrecognize, support, and honor human rights, though it is the state that\nadopts policies that officially recognize rights (and other axioms). Civic\nmorality is part of the individual\u2019s moral being. The inclusion\nof the political as a distinct aspect of moral thinking and being does\nnot take Murdoch in the direction of envisioning the human person as\ndeeply embedded in a rich web of social/institutional relationships\nthat shape her moral being and her moral requirements\u2014for\nexample, in social role relationships, as explored in her friend\nDorothy Emmet\u2019s 1966 Rules, Roles, and Relations (Emmet\n1996). Alasdair MacIntyre (Emmet\u2019s student and collaborator)\nmakes this point in a review of Metaphysics: \n\n\n[W]hat is absent is any conception of the achievement of the Good as a\ntask for human beings in community, so that the transformation of the\nself has to be a transformation of social relationships. (MacIntyre\n1993: 2)\n\n\nThe pluralistic conception of morality in the field of force idea goes\nbeyond the rejection of a single principle governing conduct, such as\nutilitarianism, Kantianism, or certain versions of virtue theory.\nThese monistic views concern only conduct, and their rejection\n(discussed earlier in relation to McDowell\u2019s Murdochian\nAristotelianism) leaves in place, in Sovereignty, a unity\ninvolved in the idea of moral vision/purification of consciousness.\nThe pluralism in Metaphysics\u2019s modes of ethical being\nidea rejects a unity of that sort as well, seeing the purification of\nconsciousness as only one, though the most significant, aspect of\nmorality in the overall \u201cfield of force\u201d of our ethical\nbeing (Hopwood 2019).\n",
