    "main_text": "Intervention\n6. Implications for Further Research in the Philosophy of Revolution\n\nBoth the ethics of revolution and the ethics of intervention in\nrevolution are heavily fact-dependent, because both are shaped by\nconsideration of the likely consequences of engaging in revolution.\nMore specifically, whether individuals or groups ought to or may\npermissibly attempt to overthrow the existing political order and\nreplace it with a new one depends, inter alia, on whether the\nprospects for significant improvement are good, relative to the likely\ncosts of trying to achieving it. And for third parties considering\nwhether to intervene either in support of or in opposition to a\nrevolution an estimate of the risks and benefits is also essential. We\nhave seen that, except in the case of Kant\u2019s Conceptual\nArgument, the division between philosophers who opt for a blanket\nprohibition on revolution (and by implication, on intervention in\nsupport of revolution) and those who hold that revolution is sometimes\njustified is best explained by the hypothesis that the opposing groups\nrely on different estimates of the risks of revolution. But we have\nalso seen that the risks vary depending upon the context in which a\nrevolution occurs. Consequently, a sound philosophical theory of\nrevolution will be particularistic, in this sense: it will acknowledge\nthat there is no correct answer to the question \u201cIs revolution\njustified,\u201d unless the context is specified and a defensible\naccount of the relationship between different contexts and different\nlikely outcomes of revolution is provided. Doing that requires an\nempirically grounded account of the relationship between particular\ncontexts and outcomes. So far, no moral theory of revolution satisfies\nthis requirement.\n\nWe conclude, accordingly, that a defensible theory of the morality of\nrevolution must rely on a descriptive-explanatory theory of how\nlarge-scale political change is likely to occur, a theory that is\ncontext-sensitive. Further, since the question is when, if ever,\nrevolutions are likely to produce a morally better political order,\nwhat is needed is nothing short of a descriptive-explanatory theory of\nmorally progressive large-scale political change.\n\nAnother way to put this fundamental point is that theorizing the\nmorality of revolution should be \u201cnaturalized,\u201d not in the\nsense that normative issues should be reduced to factual ones, but\nrather in the sense that theorists should recognize the relevance of\nthe facts about what actually happens in revolutions. Until they do\nso, perennial debates about whether revolution or reform is the best\npath to moral progress, debates of great importance for the\njustification of revolution, will remain unresolvable. That means that\nthe normative theorizing about revolution, if it is to be concrete\nenough to be action-guiding, requires not just the traditional skills\nof the philosopher, but also recourse to relevant social scientific\ntheories of how large-scale changes come about (a factual question),\nin combination with principled assessments of whether the likely\noutcomes of revolution in various contexts will be morally\nprogressive.\n",
