Hardly\nany of them has been put forth as a systematic account of all\nhyperintensional notions. However, we focus on frameworks that are\ngeneral enough to handle a broad range of phenomena (thus we do not\nconsider, e.g., hyperintensional epistemic logics that target only\ncertain forms of logical omniscience, like justification logic). We\nbriefly introduce the key ideas of each approach, and we discuss how\nit handles hyperintensional phenomena such as those introduced in\n Section 1.\n We highlight relative merits and open issues.\n",
