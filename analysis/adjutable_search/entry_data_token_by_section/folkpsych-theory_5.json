    "main_text": "Empirical Findings || Developmental Psychology\n3.2 Developmental Psychology\n\nThere exists a substantial body of research on the development of folk\npsychological abilities in young children. A range of findings in\ndevelopmental psychology reveals how younger children perform in\nexperimental settings when it comes to their dealing with a wide\nvariety of everyday mental states. For example, at around two years of\nage, children are sensitive to the fact that different people have\ndifferent goals and desires (Wellman & Phillips 2001; Bartsch\n& Wellman 1995; Repacholi & Gopnik 1997). A\ntwo-year-old\u2019s understanding of desires can be rather\nsophisticated: children understand, for example, how desires relate to\nemotions and perceptions, and what would relevantly and consistently\nsatisfy specific desires, exhibiting some fluency with counterfactual\nthinking of a limited sort.\n\nAs impressive as these abilities are, they neither equate to nor\nentail an understanding of belief\u2014and it is testing for belief\nunderstanding in younger children that takes center stage in child\ndevelopmental research on ToM. Testing for an understanding of belief\nis deemed by many to be the empirically robust, gold standard way of\nascertaining the presence or absence of ToM abilities. The\nfalse-belief test or FB test (sometimes referred to as \u201cToM\ntest\u201d) was first constructed by Perner and Wimmer in 1983, and\nthe experimental protocol has been further modified by others. It now\ncomes in many subtly different variants, including location change\ntasks, unexpected contents tasks, and appearance/reality distinction\ntasks (see Wimmer & Perner 1983; J. Flavell, E. Flavell, &\nGreen 1983; Baron-Cohen, Leslie & Frith 1985; Perner, Leekam,\n& Wimmer 1987).\n\nIn the original test of young children\u2019s grasp of false belief,\nparticipants were introduced to a puppet, Maxi. The participant\nwatched as Maxi\u2019s mother put Maxi\u2019s chocolate in cupboard\nX. In Maxi\u2019s absence, the mother moved the chocolate to cupboard\nY. When Maxi returns, participants are asked where Maxi would look for\nthe chocolate. Significantly, no participants in the 3-to-4-year range\nanswered correctly. A familiar explanation of these findings is that\nthose who fail these kinds of FB tests lack the concept of belief, or\nsufficient facility with it, be able to represent how things appear,\ncognitively speaking, from a vantage point that diverges from their\nown.\n\nFB tests have been greatly popular because they provide psychologists\nwith a well-defined yet modifiable experimental protocol that can be\napplied to different populations, across species, and in diverse\nsettings. In their 2001 meta-analysis focusing on experiments\nconducted before 1998, Wellman, Cross, and Watson (2001) reviewed 178\nsuch studies, conducted in 591 conditions.\n\nA standard assumption in developmental psychology has been that\nsomething important happens in the normal pattern of child development\nsomewhere between the ages of 3 to 5. These are the ages around which\nFB understanding is usually thought to be acquired by most normally\ndeveloping children (Astington 2001; Wellman & Liu 2004). Indeed,\nfor many, the passing of FB tests is thought to tell us something\nimportant about a subject\u2019s ToM abilities. Some hold that\nsuccess at FB test is the mark of a subject having acquired the final\ncomponent of their mature ToM. The tacit assumption made here is that\nchildren put the finishing touches on their FP competence by mastering\nthe concept of belief.\n\nThere are two things to note concerning these assumptions. Firstly,\nempirical studies of characteristic developmental patterns have\nfocused almost exclusively on subjects from WEIRD (Western, Educated,\nIndustrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies, and, as such,\nconclusions drawn from them should be treated with caution (Henrich,\nHeine, & Norenzayan 2010). Secondly, even in industrialized\nWestern populations, the full suite of standard FP abilities is not\nsecurely in place in children\u2019s performance until after the ages\nof 5 or 6. Summarising a range of empirical findings, Apperly and\nButterfill (2009) report that even older children who are capable of\npassing false belief tests still have problems understanding how\nbeliefs are acquired, how beliefs interact with desires, and in\nanticipating the emotional consequences of false beliefs.\n\nIn recent years, new kinds of FB tests experiments have shown that\nchildren as young as 25 months (Southgate, Senju, & Csibra 2007);\n15-months (Onishi & Baillargeon 2005); and 13-months (Surian,\nCaldi, & Sperber 2007) can pass language-free versions of\nfalse-belief tasks. Taken at face value the new infant data suggests\nthat very young children must have some command of the concept of\nbelief, even though much older children lack, as we have seen, the\ncapacity to pass standard, verbally based, FB tasks. These findings\nhave led to the articulation of the so-called developmental\n\u201cparadox\u201d (Southgate 2013; De Bruin & Newen 2014). Why\nis it the case that cognitively typical 3\u20135-year-old children\nstruggle with explicit FB tests if they are already competent with FP\nat much younger ages?\n\nSome TTists seek to explain the evident developmental changes in\nchildren\u2019s conceptual abilities without the need to posit any\nradical change to or development of ToM concepts. These TTists propose\nthat children do not change the conceptual components of their ToM.\nThese TTists hold that children operate with one and only one TOM with\nthe same basic concepts throughout their entire lives\u2014from early\ninfancy to adulthood (Baillargeon, Scott, & He 2010; Scott &\nBaillargeon 2017).\n\nTTists of this stripe claim that the developmental paradox is an\nillusion. By their lights, the core concepts of FP never change even\nthough the capacity to apply concepts comes in degrees. The variation\nin children\u2019s performance, they propose, is the result of other\ncomplicating factors, such as the development of executive function\ncapacities, working memory, and language abilities. On this view, the\nfailure of explicit, verbal false belief tasks does not reveal a\nconceptual deficit, rather it reveals a deficit of performance rather\ncompetence (Carruthers 2013, 2016; Baillargeon, Scott, & Bian\n2016; Sch\u00f6nherr & Westra 2019).\n\nAn alternative TT proposal is that we can beset explain the\naforementioned developmental changes in humans by positing the\nexistence of two functionally distinct ToMs. On this theory, one type\nof ToM underwrites adult FP capacities to ascribe propositional\nattitudes. Yet we also make use of a more minimal ToM, one which\nemploys and attributes weaker concepts than that of belief proper.\nThis second, earlier developing ToM is, ex hypothesi, used\nfor fast and efficient, but limited ToM tasks (Apperly &\nButterfill 2009; Butterfill & Apperly 2013). On this dual-ToM\ntheory, our first ToM never grows up. Instead, radically new concepts\nand principles come into play with the advent of our adult ToM, which\narrives at around ages 3 to 4 in normally developing Western\npopulations. After that point, both ToMs begin to work alongside one\nanother.\n\nNeutrally presented, the findings of FB tests do not automatically\nsupport ToM interpretations. What the FB data shows is that before a\ncertain age, which varies considerably with individual differences,\nchildren are unable to make correct belief attributions or to\ncorrectly answer questions about belief-related actions when this\nrequires them to specify the content of the divergent cognitive points\nof view of others. All such tests confront children with a task that\ninherently demands that they adopt a spectatorial stance.\nConsequently, the experimental data provide no direct insight into the\ntrue range of children\u2019s FB understanding. Nor do they reveal\nwhat role such FB understanding might play in children\u2019s ability\nto make sense of others in more natural and less restricted\ninteractional settings (Reddy & Morris 2004; Buttelmann,\nCarpenter, & Tomasello 2009).\n\nIt has been argued that FB tests do not probe deeply into the\nchild\u2019s FP understanding because they only test for such\nunderstanding in third-personal, experimental conditions. Such tests\nleave us none the wiser as to how frequently or centrally such FB\nunderstanding is used; how the children come by it; what enables its\nacquisition; which other tasks it might be used for; and so on.\n\nSeveral psychologists and philosophers have emphasized the\nartificiality of FB experiments and the contrived nature of the\nsituations, those requiring subjects to take up a third-personal\nstance on others, in which they are conducted. These critics of FB\ntesting conclude that while FB tests allow for the focused collection\nof data, that collected data tells us precious little about the\nuse of FP in everyday human social engagements, namely those we find\n\u201cin the wild\u201d and \u201cin the streets\u201d (Gallagher\n2001, 2015; Leudar, Costall, & Francis 2004; Leudar & Costall\n2009). Given the limits of the FB experimental protocol, it has been\nargued that such tests do not tell us much about children\u2019s FP\ncapacities in other, more ecologically valid contexts and\nsettings.\n",
