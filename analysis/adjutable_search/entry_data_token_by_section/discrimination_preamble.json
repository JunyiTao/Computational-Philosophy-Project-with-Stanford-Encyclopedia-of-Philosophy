    "main_text": "\n\n\nDiscrimination is prohibited by six of the core international human\nrights documents. The vast majority of the world\u2019s states\nhave constitutional or statutory provisions outlawing discrimination\n(Osin and Porat 2005). And most philosophical, political, and\nlegal discussions of discrimination proceed on the premise that\ndiscrimination is morally wrong and, in a wide range of cases, ought to\nbe legally prohibited. However, co-existing with this impressive\nglobal consensus are many contested questions, suggesting that there is\nless agreement about discrimination than initially meets the eye.\nWhat is discrimination? Is it a conceptual truth that discrimination is\nwrong, or is it a substantive moral judgment? What is the\nrelation of discrimination to oppression and exploitation? What\nare the categories on which acts of discrimination can be based, aside\nfrom such paradigmatic classifications as race, religion, and sex?\nThese are some of the contested issues.\n",
