    "main_text": "Theology and anthropology\n6. Theology and anthropology\n\nKaspi bases his biblical exegesis on the conventional theological\nassumptions of the Aristotelian philosophy prevalent among the Jews in\nfourteenth century Southern France. of his times. God is a necessary\nexistent, the unmoved mover, the intellect that intellectually\ncognizes  itself. Kaspi\u2019s description of God as the\nintellect borders on a certain conception of divine\nimmanence:\n\nFor we are our intellect in actu, we bring God into our\nminds, for the intellect is God and God is the intellect\u2026 For\nthat reason, Moses was called \u201ca Man of God\u201d because God\nwas always in his mind\u2026 I mean to say, \u201cdivine\npower,\u201d and there is no difference if one says \u201cGod\u201d\nor \u201cGod\u2019s power,\u201d since that same power is the\nintellect and God is the intellect (Maskiyot Kesef, p. 98).\n\n\nKaspi proposes another radical doctrine in connection with the\nAristotelian conception of God as the intellect, that which\nintellects, and the intellectum: he compares this conception with the\nHoly Trinity of Christian theology. He is even willing to accept a\nmoderate interpretation of the Trinity: \u201cSome individuals among\nthem (the Christians) are similar to us (in opinions)\u201d\n(Gevia\u2018 ha-Kesef, p. 27).\n\nKaspi explains the relationship between God and the world in as\nnaturalistic a manner as possible. He agrees with the position\nattributed to Aristotle and Plato, that the world was not created\nex nihilo at a certain point in time, arguing that this was\nalso Maimonides\u2019 position. In that spirit, Kaspi himself\nproposes a systematic explanation of the creation as described in\nGenesis.\n\nKaspi also understand God\u2019s continual providence of the world in\nentirely naturalistic terms. He interprets biblical miracles as rare\nbut natural phenomena\u2014an idea not dissimilar to Spinoza\u2019s\nteachings. To say that a certain phenomenon is contrary to natural\nlaw, Kaspi writes, is a subjective judgment, \u201cfor there is no\ndoubt that those ignorant of natural science believe many natural\nthings to be miraculous, not natural phenomena\u201d (Tirat\nKesef, p. 12). This may be compared with Spinoza in his\nTractatus Theologico-Politicus (Chap. 6): \u201c[S]ince\nmiracles were wrought according to the understanding of the masses,\nwho are wholly ignorant of the workings of nature\u2026 we cannot\ndoubt that the causes of many things, narrated in Scripture as\nmiracles could easily be explained by reference to established\nworkings of nature.\u201d Kaspi also holds that a wise prophet is\ncapable of performing miracles thanks to the possession of extensive\nknowledge. Moses, the wisest of men, performed miracles in Egypt\nbecause \u201che had acquired knowledge of the celestial body\u2026\nbecause he had captured the world of the [four sublunar]\nelements\u201d (Menorat Kesef, p. 93). This knowledge\nenabled him to inflict the plagues upon the Egyptians: \u201cWith the\nfour [elements] Moses performed actions that would be impossible for\nany [other] wise man\u201d (Commentary on Proverbs B, p. 127).\n\nDiscussing the relationship between the prophet and the wise man,\nKaspi agrees with the Muslim thinker\nal-Ba\u1e6daly\u016bs\u012b that a person with a prophetic soul\nis superior in level and essence to a wise man with a philosophical\nsoul. Nevertheless, prophecy is not a super-rational phenomenon. A\nprophet\u2019s knowledge of the future is based on deductive\ninference, since he or she is well acquainted with the world and all\ndetails of natural causality.\n\nThe ability of God and the prophets to foresee the future, despite the\napparent contradiction with the principle of (free) choice, also\nreceives a rational explanation. Kaspi proposes an analogy between\ntheir positive knowledge and the knowledge of wise men \u201cwith a\ngood sense of evaluation and estimation,\u201d who are capable of\nforeseeing the probable behavior of a person based on their knowledge\nof his or her character. Like most medieval theologians, Kaspi accepts\nthe concurrent validity of an omniscient God and human free\nchoice.\n\nNot unrelated to this antinomy is the theological problem posed by the\nhuman capacity for voluntary action. Maimonides stated the difficulty\nas follows: \u201cHow is it possible that a person can do whatever he\npleases?\u2026 How can anything be done in the world without the\npermission and will of its Creator?\u201d (Hilkhot Teshuvah\n5:4). Maimonides\u2019 solution was to define human choice as one\nexpression of the divine will, which is the cause of everything that\ntakes place in the world; accordingly, God \u201cdesired man to have\nhis own free will\u201d (ibid.). Kaspi goes further,\nhowever, suggesting the radical view that God is \u201cthe remote\nmover,\u201d even when a person chooses to realize his free will by\nsinning and worshiping idols; it was in that sense that the Bible\ndescribed God as hardening Pharaoh\u2019s heart (Matsref\nla-Kesef, pp. 152\u2013153).\n\nKaspi provides his readers with guidelines for a virtuous life. As a\nrationalist through and through, he recommends that a person acquire\nthe best possible education. Every effort should be made to accumulate\nthe financial resources necessary to improve one\u2019s education, by\npurchasing books and hiring teachers. Every man should set up a\nfamily: His wife will support him, and his children will keep him in\nhis old age, \u201cso that he should have time to acquire\nwisdom\u2026 Moreover, his sons, if they are good, will join him in\nhis studies, all the more so if his eyes have become dimmed with\nage\u201d (Commentary on Proverbs, pp. 59\u201360). This is a wholly\nutilitarian and egoistical philosophy, recommending the\nself-realization of every human being. Kaspi enunciates these\nguidelines in the context of his scriptural exegesis, relying\nprimarily on the literature of wisdom written, according to Jewish\ntradition, by King Solomon, the wisest of men. He also derives his\nrules from biblical stories, citing their heroes\u2019 behavior.\n\nKaspi\u2019s elitist principles, which create a disparity between the\nwise and the masses, also imply a similarity between humans and other\ncreatures One application of this thesis may be found in his\ncommentary on Isaiah 41:14, referring to the phrase \u201cworm of\nJacob\u201d:\n\nFor we are of the genus of the animals, similar to that of the lowest\nof the creeping insects. We are also their equal in every respect,\nunless we realize the potential of our intellect. All that is\u2026\nso that we should be aroused to acquire intelligence and the\nintelligibles, for in them we differ from the worms\u2026 (Adnei\nKesef, p. 151).\n\n\nIn this context, Kaspi expressed compassion for animals, a tendency\ntoward vegetarianism and a profound disapproval of sacrifices. He even\nexpresses disapproval of Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his\nson.\n",
