    "main_text": "Defining Culture || Culture-as-encompassing-group\n1.1 Culture-as-encompassing-group\n\nOne way to think about culture is as a kind of all-encompassing whole,\nwhich shapes all or most dimensions of our lives. It is perhaps Will\nKymlicka\u2019s formulation of a \u201csocietal culture\u201d that\nis most responsible for generating serious reflection on the nature of\nculture understood in this way. A societal culture\n\n\nprovides its members with meaningful ways of life across the full\nrange of human activities, including social, educational, religious,\nrecreational and economic life, encompassing both public and private\nspheres. (Kymlicka 1996: 76)\n\n\nKymlicka explains that a vibrant societal culture provides a\n\u201ccontext for choice\u201d, i.e., it provides the resources that\nindividuals rely on to make sense of their world and the choices it\noffers. On this account, nation-states are well-described as having a\nsocietal culture, as are Indigenous groups and sub-state national\nminority groups (for example, the Catalans or the Tibetans); immigrant\ngroups which sustain a range of cultural practices and norms even as\nthey integrate into a larger \u201csocietal culture\u201d are\nnot.\n\nKymlicka is not alone in offering an encompassing account of culture.\nMichael Walzer too offers such an account, proposing that we\nunderstand political communities as \u201ccommunities of\ncharacter\u201d, in which members are bound by a \u201cworld of\ncommon meanings\u201d (Walzer 1983: 28). Avishai Margalit and Joseph\nRaz also describe so-called \u201cencompassing\u201d groups, in\nwhich their members\n\n\nfind in them a culture which shapes to a large degree their tastes and\nopportunities, and which provides an anchor for their\nself-identification and the safety of effortless secure belonging.\n(Margalit & Raz 1990: 448)\n\n\nAvishai Margalit and Moshe Halbertal say of an encompassing group that\nits culture \u201ccovers various important aspects of life\u201d,\nand in so saying, they offer as an example the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish\nculture:\n\n\nit defines people\u2019s activities (such as Torah study in\nUltra-Orthodox culture), determines occupation (such as circumciser),\nand defines important relationships (such as marriage). It affects\neverything people do: cooking, architectural style, common language,\nliterary and artistic traditions, music, customs, dress, festivals,\nceremonies\u2026the culture influences its members\u2019 taste, the\ntypes of options they have and the meaning of these options, and the\ncharacteristics they consider significant in their evaluation of\nthemselves and others.\u00a0(Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 498)\n\n\nWhereas Kymlicka emphasizes the freedom that is offered by a\nrobust societal culture, Margalit and Halbertal speak of its role in\nsecuring\u00a0members\u2019 \u201cpersonality identity\u201d\n(Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 502) and Walzer of its importance in\nshaping a \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d. Although these\nscholars justify the protection of a robust culture for many reasons,\nthey agree that what culture does, fundamentally, is offer a\nbackground value system that helps members select among options and\ninterpret their value, including for example with respect to certain\nforms of employment, or education, or family structure and\nchild-rearing. Walzer captures the way in which culture informs how\neven the most basic of things are understood:\n\n\na single necessary good, and one that is always necessary\u2014food,\nfor example\u2014carries different meanings in different places.\nBread is the staff of life, the body of Christ, the symbol of the\nSabbath, the means of hospitality, and so on. (Walzer 1983: 8)\n\n\nMuch is illuminated by these accounts of culture, including especially\nwhy depleted societal cultures may be less able to provide the context\nfor choice that Kymlicka emphasizes, or why one\u2019s\n\u201cpersonality identity\u201d may thereby be threatened: if a\ncultural group\u2019s educational, political, or economic systems are\nweakened, their capacity to support members to make sense of the\nworld, and choose among options, is likewise weakened. Moreover, this\naccount illustrates the wrong of undermining the cultures of others:\nif a culture is undermined, the choices available to its members are\nthereby reduced. We can see this with respect to Indigenous culture in\nmany states: where states have actively attempted to erase Indigenous\nculture, the result has been severe social dislocation and alienation\namong Indigenous peoples whose context for choice has been\nsubstantially weakened.\n\nHowever, multiple objections have been launched at this way of\nunderstanding culture, most of which are variants on what is termed\nthe \u201cessentialist\u201d objection; notice, though, that the\nviews described above are not believed by their holders to be\nessentialist. The essentialist objection targets what it sees as an\nassumption that members of a culture will hold the same set of\npractices, norms, and values to be important, and in the same measure.\nBut, say critics, this assumption does not hold: in any actual\nculture, members will be differently committed to its defining\npractices and norms, and indeed, there will necessarily be\ndisagreement around which of its practices and norms are defining in\nthe first place. The essentialist objection says, roughly, that\ntreating culture as encompassing wrongly does one of the following\nthings: 1) it proclaims that certain features of a culture are at its\ncore and therefore immutable, on pain of dissolving the culture\n(Eisenberg 2009: 120), and correspondingly that cultures are\nnecessarily bounded and determinate rather than contested and\nfluid (Moore 2019; Patten 2014: 38); 2) having identified these\nfeatures as at a culture\u2019s core, it excludes those who believe\nthemselves to be members but\u00a0do not\u00a0 conform to, display, or\nrespect\u00a0these features (Parvin 2008: 318\u201319); and, 3) it\nignores the reality that most people in a liberal society \u201cdraw\ntheir identity from a multiplicity of roles and communities and\nmemberships at any one time\u201d (Parvin 2008: 321), which can\nvariously have social salience, depending on the context, both\nindependently of, and sometimes in conjunction with, cultural\nidentities (Moore 2019). In summary, a too-encompassing account of\nwhat culture is for its members runs the risk of treating the\nboundaries of a culture as if they are determinate, unshifting, and as\nthough its members display no variance (and perhaps cannot display\nvariance) in their commitment to the culture as a whole and its\ndefining practices.\n\nThe alternative accounts of culture that are considered below are all,\nat least in part, intended to respond to the essentialist challenge;\ntheir objective is, in other words, to generate a plausible account of\nwhat culture is, and correspondingly what it means to be a\nmember of a particular cultural group, that can be deployed to make\nsense of legal and political controversies, and ideally adjudicate\namong them, without succumbing to the essentialist challenge. A\ncaveat: the views of culture treated below should be understood as\n\u201cideal types\u201d, characterized so as to understand its key\nfeatures, how it is differentiated from other views, and why it does\nnot fall victim (in its own estimation) to the essentialist\nchallenge.\n",
