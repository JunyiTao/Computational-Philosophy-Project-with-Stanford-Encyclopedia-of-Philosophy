The holistic view of inheritance articulated by\nDevelopmental Systems Theory downplays the significance of the idea\nthat inheritance should be conceived as the transmission of\ninformation between generations (Griffiths & Gray 2001; Sterelny\n2001: 334, see also the discussion in Sterelny et al. 1996: 379). In\nparticular, DST uses the so-called parity argument to reject\nthe view that DNA is uniquely informational while other inherited\nresources merely provide material support for reading or interpreting\nDNA (Griffiths & Knight 1998). In recent work Griffiths applies an\ninformation-theoretic measure of causal specificity to measure how a\ngiven factor contributes to the precise determination of the\nphenotype. This measure is produced by combining the classic notion of\nmutual information, as found in Shannon information theory, with\nWoodward\u2019s notion of speficity of causes (Woodward 2010).\nGriffiths (2017) argues that this framework naturally extends to\nvarious epigenetic marks and non-coding regions of DNA that are\ncausally specific, while at the same time distinguishing these cases\nfrom many other causes of the same outcomes, such as the presence of\nRNA polymerase, that lack such specificity.\n\nJablonka (Jablonka 2001, 2002) introduced her discussion of\ninheritance systems by characterizing them as systems that carry\nhereditary information, which in turn she defined as \u201cthe\ntransmissible organization of an actual or potential state of a\nsystem\u201d (cf. the different notion of information and\nrepresentation favored by Sterelny et. al. 1996). A common framework\nfor discussing hereditary information can then be used to compare and\nanalyze various inheritance systems and expose their differences as\nwell similarities (see\n section 3.3).\n",
