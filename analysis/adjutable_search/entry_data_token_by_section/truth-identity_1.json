Historical Background\n\nThe expression \u201cthe identity theory of truth\u201d was first\nused\u2014or, at any rate, first used in the relevant sense\u2014by\nStewart Candlish in an article on F. H. Bradley published in 1989. But\nthe general idea of the theory had been in the air during the 1980s:\nfor example, in a discussion first published in 1985, concerning John\nMackie\u2019s theory of truth, McDowell criticized that theory for\nmaking \n\n\ntruth consist in a relation of correspondence (rather than identity)\nbetween how things are and how things are represented as being. (1985\n[1998: 137 n. 21]) \n\n\nThe implication is that identity would be the right way to conceive\nthe given relation. And versions of the identity theory go back at\nleast to Bradley (see, e.g., Bradley 1914: 112\u201313; for further\ndiscussion and references, see Candlish 1989; 1995; 1999b:\n209\u201312; T. Baldwin 1991: 36\u201340), and to the founding\nfathers of the analytic tradition (Sullivan 2005: 56\u20137 n. 4).\nThe theory can be found in G. E. Moore\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of\nJudgment\u201d (1899), and in the entry he wrote on\n\u201cTruth\u201d for J. Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary of\nPhilosophy and Psychology (1902\u20133; reprinted Moore 1993:\n4\u20138, 20\u20131; see T. Baldwin 1991: 40\u20133). Russell\nembraced the identity theory at least during the period of his 1904\ndiscussions of Meinong (see, e.g., 1973: 75), possibly also in his\nThe Principles of Mathematics of 1903, and for a few years\nafter these publications as well (see T. Baldwin 1991: 44\u20138;\nCandlish 1999a: 234; 1999b: 206\u20139). Frege has a statement of the\ntheory in his 1919 essay \u201cThe Thought\u201d, and may have held\nit earlier (Frege 1918\u201319: 74 [1977: 25]; see Hornsby 1997:\n4\u20136; Milne 2010: 467\u20138).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus (1922) is usually held to\npropound a correspondence rather than an identity theory of truth;\nhowever this is questionable. In the Tractatus, declarative\nsentences (S\u00e4tze) are said to be facts (arrangements of\nnames), and states of affairs (Sachlagen,\nSachverhalte, Tatsachen) are also said to be facts\n(arrangements of objects). If the Tractatus is taken to put\nforward a correspondence theory of truth, then presumably the idea is\nthat a sentence will be true just if there is an appropriate relation\nof correspondence (an isomorphism) between sentence and state of\naffairs. However, the problem with this interpretation is that, in the\nTractatus, a relation of isomorphism between a sentence and\nreality is generally conceived as a condition of the\nmeaningfulness of that sentence, not specifically of its\ntruth. False sentences, as well as true, are isomorphic with\nstates of affairs\u2014only, in their case the states of affairs do\nnot obtain. For Wittgenstein, states of affairs may either obtain or\nfail to obtain\u2014both possibilities are, in general, available to\n them.[3]\n Correlatively, it has been suggested that the Tractatus\ncontains two different conceptions of fact, a factive and a\nnon-factive one. According to the former conception, facts necessarily\nobtain or are the case; according to the latter, facts may fail to\nobtain or not be the case. This non-factive conception has been\ndiscerned at Tractatus 1.2\u20131.21, and at 2.1 (see\nJohnston 2013: 382). Given that, in the Tractatus, states of\naffairs (and perhaps facts) have two poles\u2014obtaining or being\nthe case, and non-obtaining or not being the case\u2014it seems to\nfollow that, while Wittgenstein is committed to a correspondence\ntheory of meaning, his theory of truth must be (some\nversion of) an identity theory, along the lines of \n\n\nA declarative sentence is true just if what it is semantically\ncorrelated with is identical with an obtaining state of affairs (a\nfactive fact). \n\n\n(Identity theorists normally presuppose the factive conception of\nfacts, so that \u201cfactive\u201d is redundant in the phrase\n\u201cfactive facts\u201d, and that is the policy which will be\nfollowed here.) Though a bipolar conception of facts (if indeed\nWittgenstein has it) may seem odd, the bipolar conception of states of\naffairs (which, it is generally agreed, he does have) seems quite\nnatural: here the identity theorist says that a true proposition is\nidentical with an obtaining state of affairs (see Candlish &\nDamnjanovic 2018: 271\u20132).\n\nPeter Sullivan has suggested a different way of imputing an identity\ntheory to the Tractarian Wittgenstein (2005: 58\u20139). His idea is\nthat Wittgenstein\u2019s simple objects are to be identified with\nFregean senses, and that in effect the Tractatus contains an\nidentity theory along the lines of (7) or (10). Sullivan\u2019s\nground for treating Tractarian objects as senses is that, like\nbona fide Fregean senses, they are transparent: they\ncannot be grasped in different ways. An apparent difficulty with this\nview is that there is plausibly more to Fregean sense than just the\nproperty of transparency: after all, Russell also attached the\nproperty of transparency to his basic objects, but it has not been\nsuggested that Russellian basic objects are really senses, and the\nsuggestion would seem to have little going for it (partly, though not\nonly, because Russell himself disavowed the whole idea of Fregean\nsense).The orthodox position, which will be presupposed here, is that\nthe Tractarian Wittgenstein like Russell, finds no use for a level of\nFregean sense, so that his semantical hierarchy consists exclusively\nof levels of language and reference, with nothing of a mediatory or\nsimilar nature located between these levels. (Wittgenstein does appeal\nto the concepts of sense and reference in the\nTractatus, but it is generally agreed that they do not figure\nin a Fregean way, according to which both names and sentences, for\nexample, have both sense and reference; for Wittgenstein, by contrast,\nsentences have sense but not reference, whereas names have reference\nbut not sense.)\n",
