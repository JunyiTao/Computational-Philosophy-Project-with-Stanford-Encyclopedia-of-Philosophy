    "main_text": "Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts || The Xunzi\n5.4 The Xunzi\n\nXunzi (310\u2013235 BCE) approaches emotions from the perspective of\nthe functions and processes of the mind. The mind, according to him,\nis a functional complexity consisting of diverse processes of feelings\nand its nature is not to draw upon the innate moral orientation but to\nmanifest affective sensitivity and reactivity in expressible forms. If\nthe mind has the spontaneous reactivity to external stimuli, emotions\nand feelings show how the mind interacts with or reacts to the world\n(Xunzi, 11.10). Therefore, his approach to emotions and\nfeelings, in comparison to Mencius\u2019s foundational and moral\napproach, is naturalistic and psychological. Unlike Mencius, he does\nnot investigate and analyze the innate foundations of Confucian\nvirtues. Instead, he discusses how emotions and feelings are aroused\nin the mind to serve particular perceptual, conative, and moral\nfunctions.\n\nXunzi focuses on naturally given inclinations of the mind without\nnecessarily implicating the underlying norms of ideal virtues. He\nstates that\n\n\nThe natural disposition [qing \u60c5] of people is that for food\nthey want meats, for clothes they want embroidered garments, for\ntravel they want chariots and horses, and moreover they want the\nriches of surplus wealth and accumulated goods. Even if provided these\nthings, to the end of their years they would never be satisfied; this\nis also the natural disposition [qing \u60c5] of people.\n(Xunzi, 4.11; Hutton 2014: 29)\n\n\nIn this passage, Hutton translates qing as \u201cthe natural\ndisposition\u201d. It is important to note that the meaning of\nqing as the natural disposition does not necessarily mean\nnormative or teleological sense of nature (i.e., nature as an ideal\nstandard or ultimate goal of human life) but spontaneous, unregulated\nand uncultivated tendencies of human behavior in Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy because human qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5) can\nbe disruptive and disorderly (Xunzi, 23).\n\nFrom this naturalistic viewpoint, Xunzi actively links qing\nwith psychological states and dispositions. In earlier Chinese texts\nsuch as the Mozi, for example, ren qing does not\nrefer to inner psychology or affective states. In the Xunzi,\nhowever, ren zhi qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5, qing of human\nbeings) or ren qing (\u4eba\u60c5, human qing) refers to\npsychological dispositions or affective states. Cai (2020: 407)\nreports that qing appears 119 times in the Xunzi and\n\n\n\nOf the 119 appearances of qing, fewer than 20 carry the\nneutral or positive import of \u201cthe nature of things\u201d. \n\n\nSpecifically, Xunzi connects qing with inner subjective\nstates. He states that \n\n\nThe feelings of liking and disliking, happiness and anger, and sadness\nand joy in one\u2019s nature are called the dispositions\n[qing \u60c5]. (Xunzi, 22.2; Hutton 2014: 236) \n\n\nAmong Chinese texts in the Warring States period, this is one of the\npassages where qing is discussed explicitly in the context of\ninner subjective feelings. However, the passage, in itself, does not\nnecessarily show that qing is understood or identified as\nemotions in Xunzi\u2019s philosophy. Instead, emotions can be\nunderstood as expressions, derivations, or one of the manifestations\nof the underlying nature or essence of human beings, as Graham (1990:\n64) suggests. Whether one takes Graham\u2019s interpretation or not,\nit is clear that Xunzi brings qing close to the affective\ndimension of the mind. In fact, the careful observation, modification,\nand cultivation of qing as an affective disposition is a key\nelement of Xunzi\u2019s moral philosophy as illustrated in his\nchapters on ritual and music. \n\nAccording to Xunzi, human qing has a distinctive inclination\nof yu (\u6b32 desire). People like to satisfy their desires for\nmaterial goods such as fancy food and fine clothes. \n\n\nThe natural disposition [\u60c5] of people is that for food they want\n[yu \u6b32] meats, for clothes they want embroidered\ngarments\u2026. (Xunzi, 4.11; Hutton 2014: 29) \n\n\nIn this passage, yu (\u6b32) means desire for material values\nand one\u2019s interest in maximizing one\u2019s self-interest.\nXunzi believes that yu is an inborn disposition of human\npsychology and human beings are self-interested individuals who seek\nto satisfy their desires that are not completely satisfied. As a\nresult, yu generates competitive struggle and violence. He\nstates that \n\n\nThey [people] are born with desires of the eyes and ears, a fondness\nfor beautiful sights and sounds. If they follow along with these, then\nlasciviousness and chaos will arise\u2026. (Xunzi 23.1;\nHutton 2014: 248) \n\n\nUnlike Mencius\u2019 optimistic approach to innate dispositions such\nas the four moral sprouts, Xunzi\u2019s approach to the natural\ndisposition of yu is cautious and despairing if not\ncompletely hopeless: yu is a major threat to the orderliness\nand stability of human living. Human nature is evil, he declares\n(Xunzi, 23.1), because of this natural but self-interested\npsychological disposition of the human mind.\n\nYu is typically understood as a conative state, a state of\nwanting or seeking (Xunzi, 4.11, 23.1). However, Xunzi\nexplains it in the context of perceptual states such as seeing,\nhearing, and tasting, i.e., how our sensory organs search for their\nobjects.\n\n\nAs for people\u2019s natural dispositions [qing \u60c5], their\neyes desire [yu \u6b32] the utmost in sights, their ears desire\nthe utmost in sounds, their mouths desire the utmost in flavors, their\nnoses desire the utmost in smells, and their bodies desire the utmost\nin comfort. These \u201cfive utmosts\u201d are something the natural\ndispositions [qing \u60c5] of people cannot avoid desiring.\n(Xunzi, 11.10; Hutton 2014: 104)\n\n\nIn this passage, Xunzi describes the way our sensory organs are\nrelated to their targets. Perceptual states have their objects, i.e.,\nwhat they see, hear, and smell. Yu describes this relational\nproperty (i.e., intentionality) of the mind in addition to its\noriginal function of desiring \u201cfive utmost objects\u201d. That\nis, yu is not just a natural tendency to satisfy one\u2019s\ndesires but also perceptual intentionality that resides at a\nfoundational (perceptual) level of the human mind. If intentionality,\nas Brentano (1874) explains, is a distinctive and an essential nature\nof the mind, Xunzi\u2019s yu and qing include this\nfoundational aspect of the mind (the relationality or about-ness of\nthe mind) from an affective viewpoint.\n\nThe relation between qing and yu, therefore, should\nbe understood at a deeper level of human nature or perhaps the nature\nof the universe. Xunzi provides such an explanation. He states\nthat\n\n\nHuman nature [xing \u6027 nature] is the accomplishment of\nHeaven [tian \u5929]. The dispositions [qing \u60c5\nnatural disposition or essential property] are the substance of the\nnature [xing \u6027 nature]. The desires [yu \u6b32] are\nthe responses of the dispositions [qing \u60c5] to things.\nViewing the objects of desire as permissible to obtain and seeking\nthem are what the dispositions [qing \u60c5] cannot avoid.\n(Xunzi, 22.15; Hutton 2014: 244)\n\n\nIn this passage, Xunzi explains that yu derives from\nqing and qing comes from xing (the\nfoundational nature of things). Against this broad process of\nderivation from tian (Heaven) to yu through\nxing and qing (as indicated in the schematic diagram\nbelow), yu can be understood as an unavoidable inborn\ndisposition of human beings. \n\n\nTian (\u5929 Heaven) \u2192 Xing (\u6027 nature) \u2192\nQing (\u60c5 natural disposition) \u2192 (Qing\u2019s\nResponse [Ying \u61c9] to external stimulation) \u2192\nYu (\u6b32 desire)\n\n\nThis cosmological process can help us understand how qing\ncame to include a new semantic dimension, i.e., psychological\ndisposition of desire or emotion from its original meaning of nature\nor essence. According to Xunzi, qing is related not only to\nobjective and essential nature of things (xing \u6027) but also\nto the psychological inclinations of human beings (yu \u6b32),\nbecause qing derives from xing (nature) and\ngenerates yu (desire). In this process of\nqing\u2019s origination and projection, one can understand\nthat qing does not simply refer to objective, static, and\neternal nature of things but also to the interactive and responsive\ndispositions of human beings. A similar approach to qing can\nbe found in Xing Zi Ming Chu\n(\u6027\u81ea\u547d\u51fa Human Nature comes from the\nMandate), an excavated Confucian text written in the mid-fourth to\nearly third century BCE. According to Xing Zi Ming\nChu, qing is aroused when xing (human nature)\nis stimulated by external objects. \n\n\nEmotional (xi, nu, ai, bei\n[delight, anger, grief, sadness]) qi [material force or\nphysical energy] is due to xing. When it manifests\nexternally, it is due to sensual contact with things (wu qu\nzhi \u7269\u53d6\u4e4b). (Xing Zi Ming Chu, 1.1;\nTang, Bruya, and Wen 2003: 275; Middendorf 2008: 152) \n\n\nFrom this broad perspective of foundational xing and\nresponsive qing, one can understand how the objective and\nsubjective aspects of qing are integrated in Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy through the interactive responsiveness or resonance among\nthings.\n\nXunzi\u2019s naturalistic and psychological approach, however, does\nnot imply that emotions are just subjective feelings and the mind is\nonly amoral or immoral. The genuineness of emotion is still important\nin Xunzi\u2019s moral psychology, as in Confucius\u2019s and\nMencius\u2019s. Xunzi discusses, for example, why it is important to\npay full respect to deceased people with loyalty, generosity and the\nfull decoration of coffins. He explains that people have genuine\nfeelings for deceased people because treating life and death with one\nand the same care is what people all wish for (Xunzi, 19.17;\nHutton 2014: 207). He also explains how genuine emotions can be\ncultivated through the affective transformation. According to him,\nemotional genuineness can be developed through various means of social\nand cultural activities such as ritual and music because affective\nstates, through careful adjustment and modification, can be enriched\nand refined to become sincere states of the mind. For example, people\nfind joy in music with their deep and affective resonance with musical\nperformance. Xunzi states that \u201cSounds and music enter into\npeople deeply and transform people quickly\u201d (Xunzi,\n20.5; Hutton 2014: 219). Even though emotions are influenced by the\nnatural disposition of yu, they can transform the heart-mind\nto follow the way of the sages through the process of responsive\nrefinement in music and ritual. Xunzi\u2019s philosophy shows this\ndevelopmental and transformative nature of emotions.\n",
