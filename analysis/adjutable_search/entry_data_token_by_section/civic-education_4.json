    "main_text": "The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions || Mill: Education Through Political Participation\n1.4 Mill: Education Through Political Participation\n\nMill argued that participation in representative government, or\ndemocracy, is undertaken both for its educative effects on\nparticipants and for the beneficial political outcomes. Even if\nelected or appointed officials can perform better than citizens, Mill\nthought it advisable for citizens to participate \u201cas a means to\ntheir own mental education\u2014a mode of strengthening their active\nfaculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar\nknowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal. This\nis a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial; of\nfree and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conduct of\nindustrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary\nassociations\u201d (1972, 179). Thus, political participation is a\nform of civic education good for men and for citizens.\n\nOn Liberty, the essay in which the above quotation appears,\nis not, writes Mill, the occasion for developing this idea as it\nrelates to \u201cparts of national education.\u201d But in\nMill\u2019s view the development of the person can and should be\nundertaken in concert with an education for citizens. The\n\u201cmental education\u201d he describes is \u201cin truth, the\npeculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the political\neducation of a free people, taking them out of the narrow circle of\npersonal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to the\ncomprehension of joint interests, the management of joint\nconcerns\u2014habituating them to act from public or semi-public\nmotives, and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of\nisolating them from one another\u201d (Idem).\n\nThe occasion for discussing civic education as a method of both\npersonal and political development is Mill\u2019s Considerations\non Representative Government. Mill wants to see persons\n\u201cprogress.\u201d To achieve progress requires \u201cthe\npreservation of all kinds and amounts of good which already exist, and\nProgress as consisting in the increase of them.\u201d Of what does\nMill\u2019s good consist? First are \u201cthe qualities in the\ncitizens individually which conduce most to keep up the amount of good\nconduct\u2026Everybody will agree that those qualities are industry,\nintegrity, justice, and prudence\u201d (1972, 201). Add to these\n\u201cthe particular attributes in human beings which seem to have a\nmore especial reference to Progress\u2026They are chiefly the\nqualities of mental activity, enterprise, and courage\u201d (Ibid,\n202).\n\nSo, progress is encouraged when society develops the qualities of\ncitizens and persons. Mill tells us that good government depends on\nthe qualities of the human beings that compose it. Men of virtuous\ncharacter acting in and through justly administered institutions will\nstabilize and perpetuate the good society. Good persons will be good\ncitizens, provided they have the requisite political institutions in\nwhich they can participate. Such participation\u2014as on juries and\nparish offices\u2014takes participants out of themselves and away\nfrom their selfish interests. If that does not occur, if persons\nregard only their \u201cinterests which are selfish,\u201d then,\nconcludes Mill, good government is impossible. \u201c\u2026[I]f the\nagents, or those who choose the agents, or those to whom the agents\nare responsible, or the lookers-on whose opinion ought to influence\nand check all these, are mere masses of ignorance, stupidity, and\nbaleful prejudice, every operation of government will go wrong\u201d\n(Ibid, 207).\n\nFor Mill good government is a two-way street: Good government depends\non \u201cthe virtue and intelligence of the human beings composing\nthe community\u201d; while at the same time government can further\n\u201cpromote the virtue and intelligence of the people\nthemselves\u201d (Idem). A measure of the quality of any political\ninstitution is how far it tends \u201cto foster in the members of the\ncommunity the various desirable qualities\u2026moral, intellectual,\nand active\u201d (Ibid, 208). Good persons act politically as good\ncitizens and are thereby maintained or extended in their goodness.\n\u201cA government is to be judged by its actions upon men\u2026by\nwhat it makes of the citizens, and what it does with them; its\ntendency to improve or deteriorate the people themselves.\u201d\nGovernment helps people advance, acts for the improvement of the\npeople, \u201cis at once a great influence acting on the human\nmind\u2026.\u201d Government is, then, \u201can agency of national\neducation\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 210, 211).\n\nFollowing Tocqueville, Mill saw political participation as the basis\nfor this national education. \u201cIt is not sufficiently considered\nhow little there is in most men\u2019s ordinary life to give any\nlargeness either to their conceptions or to their sentiments.\u201d\nTheir work is routine and dull; they proceed through life without much\ninterest or energy. On the other hand, \u201cif circumstances allow\nthe amount of public duty assigned him to be considerable, it makes\nhim an educated man\u201d (Ibid, 233). In this way participation in\ndemocratic institutions \u201cmust make [persons] very different\nbeings, in range of ideas and development of faculties, from those who\nhave done nothing in their lives but drive a quill, or sell goods over\na counter\u201d (Idem).\n\nThere was no national public schooling in Mill\u2019s Great Britain,\nand there were clearly lots of Britons without the requisite\ncharacteristics either of good citizens or of good men. Mill was\ncertainly aware of this. He was much influenced by Tocqueville\u2019s\nwritings on the tyranny of the majority. Mill feared, as did\nTocqueville, that the undereducated or uneducated would dominate and\ntyrannize politics so as to undermine authority and individuality.\nBeing ignorant and inexperienced, the uneducated and undereducated\nwould be susceptible to all manner of demagoguery and manipulation. So\ntoo much power in the hands of the inept and ignorant could damage\ngood citizenship and dam the course of self-development. To remedy\nthis Mill proposed two solutions: limit participation and provide the\ncompetent and educated with plural votes.\n\nIn Mill\u2019s \u201cideally best polity\u201d the highest levels\nof policymaking would be reserved for nationally elected\nrepresentatives and for experts in the civil service. These\nrepresentatives and experts would not only carry out their political\nduties, but they would also educate the public through debate and\ndeliberation in representative assemblies, in public forums, and\nthrough the press. To assure that the best were elected and for the\nsake of rational government, Mill provided plural votes to those with\ncollege educations and to those of certain occupations and training.\nAll citizens (but the criminal and illiterate) could vote, but not all\ncitizens would vote equally. Some citizens, because they were educated\nor highly trained persons, were \u201cbetter\u201d than others:\n\u201c\u2026[T]hough every one ought to have a voice\u2014that\nevery one should have an equal voice is a totally different\nproposition\u2026No one but a fool\u2026feels offended by the\nacknowledgment that there are others whose opinion, and even whose\nwish, is entitled to a greater amount of consideration than his\u201d\n(Ibid, 307\u20138).\n\nBut education was the great leveling factor. Though not his view when\nhe wrote Considerations on Representative Government, Mill\nwrote in his autobiography that universal education could make plural\nvoting unnecessary (1924, pp. 153, 183\u201384). Mill did acknowledge\nin Representative Government that a national system of\neducation or \u201ca trustworthy system of general examination\u201d\nwould simplify the means of ascertaining \u201cmental\nsuperiority\u201d of some persons over others. In their absence, a\nperson\u2019s years of schooling and nature of occupation would\nsuffice to determine who would receive plural votes (1972,\n308\u201309). Given Mill\u2019s prescriptions for political\nparticipation and given the lessons learned from the deliberations and\ndebates of representatives and experts, however, it is doubtful that\ncivic education would have constituted much of his national\neducation.\n",
