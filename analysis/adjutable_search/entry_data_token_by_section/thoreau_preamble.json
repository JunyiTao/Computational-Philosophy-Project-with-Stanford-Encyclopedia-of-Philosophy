    "main_text": "\n\nHenry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862) was an American philosopher,\npoet, environmental scientist, and political activist whose major\nwork, Walden, draws upon each of these various identities in\nmeditating upon the concrete problems of living in the world as a\nhuman being. He sought to revive a conception of philosophy as a way\nof life, not only a mode of reflective thought and discourse.\nThoreau\u2019s work was informed by an eclectic variety of sources.\nHe was well-versed in classical Greek and Roman philosophy (and\npoetry), ranging from the pre-Socratics through the Hellenistic\nschools, and was also an avid student of the ancient scriptures and\nwisdom literature of various Asian traditions. He was familiar with\nmodern philosophy ranging from Descartes, Locke, and the Cambridge\nPlatonists through Emerson, Coleridge, and the German Idealists, all\nof whom are influential on Thoreau\u2019s philosophy. He discussed\nhis own empirical findings with leading naturalists of the day, and\nread the latest work of Humboldt and Darwin with interest and\nadmiration. His philosophical explorations of self and world led him\nto develop an epistemology of embodied perception and a non-dualistic\naccount of mental and material life. In addition to his focus on\nethics in an existential spirit, Thoreau also makes unique\ncontributions to ontology, the philosophy of science, and radical\npolitical thought. Although his political essays have become justly\nfamous, his works on natural science were not even published until the\nlate twentieth century, and they help to give us a more complete\npicture of him as a thinker. Among the texts he left unfinished was a\nset of manuscript volumes filled with information on Native American\nreligion and culture. Thoreau\u2019s work anticipates certain later\ndevelopments in pragmatism, phenomenology, and environmental\nphilosophy, and poses a perennially valuable challenge to our\nconception of the methods and intentions of philosophy itself.\n",
