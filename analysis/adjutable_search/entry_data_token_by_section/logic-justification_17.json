    "main_text": "Semantics || Single World Justification Models\n3.4 Single World Justification Models\n\n\nSingle world justification models were developed considerably before\nthe more general possible world justification models we have been\ndiscussing, (Mkrtychev 1997). Today they can most simply be thought of\nas possible world justification models that happen to have a single\nworld. The completeness proof for \\(\\mathsf{J}\\) and the other\njustification logics mentioned above can easily be modified to\nestablish completeness with respect to single world justification\nmodels, though of course this was not the original argument. What\ncompleteness with respect to single world justification models tells\nus is that information about the possible world structure of\njustification models can be completely encoded by the admissible\nevidence function, at least for the logics discussed so far. Mkrtychev\nused single world justification models to establish decidability of\n\\(\\mathsf{LP}\\), and others have made fundamental use of them in\nsetting complexity bounds for justification logics, as well as for\nshowing conservativity results for justification logics of belief\n(Kuznets 2000, Kuznets 2008, Milnikel 2007, Milnikel 2009). Complexity\nresults have further been used to address the problem of logical\nomniscience.\n",
