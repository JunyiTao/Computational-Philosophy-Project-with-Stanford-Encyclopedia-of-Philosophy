    "preamble": "\n\nThe idea that some characteristics of an organism are explained by its\nintrinsic nature, whilst others reflect the influence of the\nenvironment is an ancient one. It has even been argued that this\ndistinction is itself part of the evolved psychology of the human\nspecies. The distinction played an important role in the history of\nphilosophy as the locus of the dispute between Rationalism and\nEmpiricism discussed in\n another entry\n in this encyclopedia. This entry focuses on accounts of the\ninnate/acquired distinction from the mid 19th century to\nthe present. These accounts have for the most part been inspired by\nthe sciences of mind and behavior. Hence, Section 1 focuses on key\nscientific controversies about the innate/acquired distinction in the\nbehavioral sciences since Darwin. We choose this starting point\nbecause the theory of evolution is the inevitable background to any\nmodern discussion of innate behavior. Moreover, Darwin himself\npioneered an approach to the study of innate behavior that remains\ninfluential even today.\n\nHaving outlined these key scientific debates, we then turn to attempts\nby philosophers to understand those debates. Section 2 considers five\nalternative diagnoses of why nativism is the subject of so many\nscientific controversies. The first diagnosis is that scientists\nsimply fail to appreciate the legitimate differences in explanatory\nemphasis across different sciences. The second diagnosis is that\nscientists disagree about whether certain cognitive traits are\nacquired by special (as opposed to general) purpose learning\nmechanisms. The third diagnosis sees the innateness concept as a\ndisciplinary boundary marker between psychological and biological\nsciences. The fourth diagnosis claims that scientific debates are the\nresult of a deeply muddled concept which conflates various properties\nthat ought to be distinguished. The fifth diagnosis claims that\nscientific conceptions of innateness are easily conflated with a\ndeeply unscientific vernacular conception that is grounded in folk\nessentialism.\n\nAlthough philosophers disagree about which (if any) of these diagnoses\nare correct, there is almost universal agreement that our vernacular\nor \u201cfolk\u201d concept of innateness is out of step with recent\nadvances in biology and psychology. Section 3 considers several\nattempts to revise the vernacular concept of innateness to avoid some\nof its more obvious scientific pitfalls. One proposal recommends\ndefining a trait as innate insofar is it genetically specified or\nencoded. Another proposal defines innateness as developmental\ninvariance. A third defines innateness in terms of the biological\nproperty of developmental canalization. A fourth revisionist proposal\ndefines innateness as a psychological disposition that is\nenvironmentally triggered. Each of these proposals faces shortcomings\nthat are outlined in this entry and which suggest, to some, a very\ndifferent strategy for the behavioral sciences. Instead of revising\nthe concept of innateness to render it more scientifically accurate,\nanother option is to eliminate the innate/acquired distinction from\nscientific discourse. Section 3 concludes with a review of of this\neliminativist proposal.\n\nFinally, in our conclusion we reflect on how philosophy can hope to\nadvance our understanding of innateness and related concepts, and how\nthis philosophical work relates to the sciences of the mind in which\nthese concepts remain vital and contested.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Outline of scientific debates over nativism\n\nIn human and animal psychology since Darwin there have been a number\nof periods when the innate/acquired distinction was the subject of\nheated scientific controversy. This section reviews some of these\ndebates. It provides a sense of how different scientists have\nconceptualized instinct or innateness, the kinds of evidence\nmarshalled to support nativist hypotheses, and some of the recurring\nobjections that nativist proposals have encountered. In scientific\npsychology the words \u201cinnate\u201d and\n\u201cinstinctive\u201d have been used to refer to the same cluster\nof properties, \u201cinstinct\u201d being a now somewhat antiquated\nterm for an innate psychological trait. Hence, in this section we take\nolder debates over instinct to be about the same set of issues as more\nrecent debates over innateness.\n1.1 Darwin versus Wallace\n\nCharles Darwin pioneered an approach to the study of instinct that\naimed to show, above all, that instincts evolve gradually as\nadaptations to a species\u2019 environment. Darwin\u2019s theory of\ninstinct was developed in opposition to William Paley, William Kirby,\nand other influential Natural Theologians (Grinnell 1985; Richards\n1981; 1987; Rochowiak 1988). Paley defined an instinct as \u201ca\n[behavioral] propensity prior to experience and independent of\ninstruction\u201d (Richards 1981). Examples such as bird migration,\nnest building, and mating preference seemed, to Paley, not possibly\nacquired by experience. The best explanation for these instincts was\nthat they are Divinely implanted. Likewise, Kirby viewed animal\ninstincts as a means by which God animates the material world:\n\u201cif animals lost their instincts, birds would no longer build\ntheir nests, or migrate, or learn to fly. Bears would not know when to\nhibernate, nor salmon when to be driven upstream to spawn; the entire\nanimal kingdom would be thrown into disarray\u201d (Grinnell 1985,\n57). Like many theologically inspired naturalists at the time, Paley\nand Kirby drew a sharp distinction between instinctive vs acquired\nbehavior. Since instincts were thought to be designed by God, and thus\nperfect, there would be no need to supplement or modify them through\nindividual learning.\n\nDarwin offered a naturalistic alternative to the theological account.\nMarshalling anecdotes from zookeepers, breeders, and his own\nobservations, Darwin presented evidence that instincts adapt to a\nchanging environment. One process by which they evolve is unguided\nvariation and natural selection. However, like many of his\ncontemporaries, Darwin also accepted an alternative \u201cinherited\nhabits\u201d model of instinct evolution. Habits are behaviors that\noriginate as intelligent acts and become increasingly automatic over\nrepeated performances. Although historians disagree about which\nmechanism Darwin took to be the more significant, it appears that he\ntook both natural selection and inherited habits to be involved in the\nevolution of instinct. As he explained in The Origin,\n\u201cIf we suppose any habitual action to become inherited \u2013\nand I think that this does sometimes happen \u2013 then the\nresemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct\nbecomes so close as not to be distinguished\u201d (1859, 187).\nDarwin\u2019s dual-mechanism view inspired other researchers to\nexplore the relationship between intelligence, habit, and instinct. Of\nparticular note is George Romanes, a protege of Darwin who sought to\nclarify and elaborate his mentor\u2019s theory of instinct. In his\nbooks on animal intelligence, Romanes (1882; 1883) distinguished two\ntypes of instinct: primary instincts that evolve by a process\nof natural selection, and secondary instincts that evolve by\nthe inheritance of acquired habits.\n\nA noteworthy critic of Darwin\u2019s account of instinct was none\nother than Alfred Russel Wallace, co-founder of the principle of\nnatural selection. Wallace was notoriously hostile to Darwin\u2019s\nview of the human mind as the product of selection (Gould 1980). As he\nasserted in a letter to Charles Lyell,\n\nUnless Darwin can show me how this rudimentary or latent musical\nability in the lowest races can have been developed by survival of the\nfittest \u2013 can have been of use to the individual or race so as\nto cause those who possessed it in a fractional greater degree than\nothers to win the struggle for life, I must believe that some\nother power caused that development \u2013 and so on with every other\nespecially human characteristic. (1869, quoted in (Richards 1987, 183)\nitalics in original)\n\n\nWallace was critical of Darwin\u2019s claim, defended extensively in\nThe Descent of Man (1871) that many human behaviors are\ngrounded in instincts that are shared with other species. In his\nessay, \u201cOn instinct in man and animals,\u201d (1891) Wallace\npresented alternative explanations for how allegedly instinctive human\nbehaviors might be acquired by learning (Gross 2010). In a paper\nentitled \u201cThe philosophy of birds\u2019 nests\u201d, Wallace\nargued that Darwin was wrong even about the instinctive basis of\nanimal behavior:\n\nIf instinct means anything, it means the capacity to perform some\ncomplex act without teaching or experience. It implies not only innate\nideas but innate knowledge of a very definite kind\u2026 but in the\nparticular instance of birds\u2019 nests which is usually considered\nits stronghold, I cannot find a particle of evidence of anything\nbeyond those lower reason and imitative powers which animals are\nuniversally permitted to possess. (1891, quoted in Gross 2010, 503)\n\n\nNotice that Wallace understood instincts to involve knowledge\n\u201cof a very definite kind\u201d that arises without teaching or\nexperience. By contrast, he allowed that animals inherit certain\ngeneral (i.e. non-specific) cognitive capacities, such as \u201clower\nreason\u201d and learning by imitation, but these were not classified\nas instincts. Instead, Wallace described such general capacities as\nemanating from the \u201corganization of the nervous system\u201d\n(Gross 2010). He thought that these mechanisms provide a more\nplausible explanation for the acquisition of most animal and human\nbehavior than Darwin\u2019s appeal to instinct.\n1.2 The rise of instinct psychology at the turn of the 20th century\n\nWallace\u2019s criticisms were overshadowed by Darwin\u2019s\npopularity and influence. The final decade of the 19th\ncentury saw growing scientific interest in the study of instincts,\nmuch of it in a Darwinian vein. This was also a period of intense\ndispute about the nature of instincts. A key point of disagreement\nconcerned the relationship between instinct and habit during\ndevelopment. William James outlined a list of roughly forty human\ninstincts in his Principles of Psychology, and famously\nproclaimed that humans possess more (not fewer) instincts compared to\nother animals. His list included such eyebrow-raising candidates as\n\u201ca native impulse in everyone to conceal love affairs\u201d, a\n\u201cgenuine instinct of cleanliness\u201d, and an \u201cinstinct\nof personal isolation, which in women is called coyness\u201d (1890,\n393). It is important to understand what James meant when classifying\nsuch behaviors as instinctive. For James, the influence of instinct on\nbehavior takes place during early stages of development. As he\nexplained in Principles of Psychology, \u201cMost instincts\nare implanted for the sake of giving rise to habits and\u2026 this\npurpose, once accomplished, the instincts themselves, as such, have no\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre in the psychical economy, and consequently\nfade away\u201d (1890, 398). Thus, to call a behavior\n\u201cinstinctive\u201d meant, for James, that it has a\ndevelopmental origin in some more basic behavior which itself required\nno prior experience. After first performance, however, the original\nbehavior is modified by reason, learning, and habit. This\ndevelopmental model stood in contrast to the more static view of\ninstinct defended by Romanes and others, wherein instincts often\nremain unmodified by experience into maturity.\n\nA second point of scientific disagreement concerned the evolutionary\norigin of instincts. The prevailing view, held by Romanes and others,\ninvolved the inheritance of acquired habits.\n\u201cLate-19th century psychologists and intellectuals in\ngeneral assumed that heredity and environment could not be separated\nfunctionally or treated as independent factors, because change induced\nby the environment would sooner or later (depending on the author)\nbecome a part of the organism\u2019s racial heritage\u201d (Cravens\nand Burnham 1971, 637\u201338). This model was fiercely criticized by\nAugust Weismann (1891 (1888)), who drew a sharp distinction between\ngerm plasm and soma. On Weismann\u2019s model, the germ plasm (i.e.\nhereditary material) is sequestered early in development placing it\nbeyond the influence of somatic modifications, including habits or\nother traits acquired over the life of an organism. In addition,\nWeismann maintained that selection acts only on traits that emanate\ndirectly from the germline (Johnston 1987). He allowed that some\ntraits are the product of environmental modifications during\ndevelopment. But these, Weismann held, could never become adaptations.\nThus, Weismann distinguished hereditary traits, which were under\ndirect control of the germline and could become adapted to the\nenvironment, from acquired traits, which were due to arbitrary\nenvironmental influences on the soma.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Weismann\u2019s views became popular at a time\nwhen many behavioral scientists rejected the distinction between\ninnate vs acquired characteristics. Not only James, but also Conwy\nLloyd Morgan (1896), Henry Fairfield Osborn (Kemp 1896) and James Mark\nBaldwin (1896) were developing models of behavioral evolution and\ndevelopment that emphasized an interaction between learned and\nhereditary factors (Boakes 1984). These authors followed Weismann in\naccepting that habits did not become incorporated into heredity as\ninstincts, but sought to explain how it could appear that\nacquired behavior became hereditary through mechanisms later, and\ndismissively, labelled \u2018Baldwin effects\u2019. According to\nhistorian Timothy Johnston, Weismann\u2019s popularity explains,\n\u201cwhy the dichotomy [between innate vs acquired traits] has been\nso influential and so long-lived in the twentieth century, despite\nrepeated and quite cogent arguments against it\u201d (1995, 115).\n\nWe have just considered two points of disagreement over the nature of\ninstinct that arose in the late 19th century as this concept was\ngaining in scientific currency. In fact, Morgan (1895) identified a\ntotal of seven \u201cdefinitional\u201d issues surrounding the\ninstinct concept in his day. It is noteworthy, given how fecund the\nconcept of instinct was in motivating scientific research between\n1880\u20131900, that instinct was already being criticised for its\nambiguity. Morgan expressed his frustration with this situation in the\nfollowing, frequently cited passage:\n\nInstinctive activities are unconscious (Claus), non-mental\n(Calderwood), incipiently conscious (Spencer), distinguished by the\npresence of consciousness (Romanes), accompanied by emotions in the\nmind (Wundt), involve connate ideas and inherited knowledge\n(Spalding); synonymous with impulsive activities (James), to be\ndistinguished from those involving impulse proper (Hoffding,\nMarshall); not yet voluntary (Spencer), no longer voluntary (Lewes),\nnever involuntary (Wundt); due to natural selection only (Weismann),\nto lapsed intelligence (Lewes, Schneider, Wundt), to both (Darwin,\nRomanes); to be distinguished from individually-acquired habits\n(Darwin, Romanes, Sully, and others), inclusive thereof (Wundt); at a\nminimum in man (Darwin, Romanes), at a maximum in man (James);\nessentially congenital (Romanes), inclusive of individually-acquired\nmodifications through intelligence (Darwin, Romanes, Wallace). (Lloyd\nMorgan 1895, quoted in Herrnstein 1972, 26)\n\n\nThe next two decades saw no decline in psychologists\u2019 interest\nin instincts. Between 1900 and 1920 over 600 articles and books were\npublished on this topic in the USA and England alone (Cravens 1978).\nMany of these publications emulated William James\u2019 work,\npresenting lists of candidate human and animal instincts. However,\nthese authors often departed from James\u2019 developmental account,\nviewing instincts instead as emerging fully formed and insensitive to\nexperience. Lists of candidate instincts also varied dramatically,\nwith some authors positing as few as two human instincts and others\nidentifying as many as 110 (L. L. Bernard 1921). William\nMcDougall\u2019s Introduction to Social Psychology (1908)\nwas an attempt to impose rigor to this branch of psychology. McDougall\nwas critical of his fellow instinct theorists, complaining that\n\u201c[h]undreds of passages might be quoted from contemporary\nauthors, even some of considerable philosophical culture, to\nillustrate how these two words [\u2018instinct\u2019 and\n\u2018instinctive\u2019] are used with a minimum of meaning,\ngenerally with the effect of disguising from the writer the obscurity\nand incoherence of his thought\u201d (1908, cited in Herrnstein\n1972). McDougall\u2019s solution was to define instincts more\nprecisely as motivational or \u2018hormic\u2019 internal states.\nSpecifically, he proposed that instincts are:\n\nan inherited or innate psycho-physical disposition which determines\nits possessor to perceive, and to pay attention to, objects of a\ncertain class, to experience an emotional excitement of a particular\nquality upon perceiving such an object, and to act in regard to it in\na particular manner, or, at least, to experience an impulse to such\naction. (1908, 25)\n\n\nMcDougall went on to posit various learning rules describing how both\nthe perceptual inputs and the behavioral outputs associated with an\ninstinct are modified by experience (Herrnstein 1972). Thus, much like\nJames, McDougall downplayed the distinction between instinctive vs\nacquired behavior, focusing instead on the developmental interaction\nbetween instincts (viewed as motivational states) and other factors\nsuch as perception and action. Dewsbury (1993) further notes that, for\nMcDougall, instincts were psychological processes that interacted with\nperceptions, emotions, and behavioral impulses.\n\nMcDougall\u2019s effort to reform the scientific concept of instinct\nwas perhaps too little too late, as his work primarily served as\nfodder for a group of anti-hereditarian psychologists who emerged in\nthe early 1920s. Three of the most outspoken critics of instinct were\nKnight Dunlap, Luther Lee Bernard, and Zing-Yang Kuo (Gu\u014d\nR\u00e8nyu\u01cen). Their arguments are worth considering,\nespecially since many of the same objections would be revived two\ndecades later in opposition to the ethological concept of\ninnateness.\n1.3 Critiques of instinct psychology in the 1920s\n\nOne of the first frontal attacks on the concept of instinct was that\nof social psychologist Knight Dunlap (1919). He contrasted two general\napproaches to the study of instinct. The \u201cphysiological\u201d\napproach identified each instinct with a distinct neuro-physiological\nmechanism. Dunlap was in principle supportive of this approach,\nclaiming that it could potentially generate useful definitions of\nparticular instincts. However, Dunlap lamented that, \u201cI am very\nstrongly convinced that it is not at present possible to secure\nagreement to confine the term to this meaning\u201d (1919, 308). The\nproblem, he thought, stemmed from the prevalence of\n\u201cteleological\u201d approaches to instinct, of which McDougall\nwas a prime example. On the teleological approach, components of\nbehavior are grouped together as members of a class according to their\ntendency to generate some functional outcome. Dunlap cited the\n\u201cmoral instinct\u201d and \u201cthe instinct for\npugnacity\u201d as examples. Dunlap was willing to tolerate this\napproach provided that \u201c[t]he grouping of activities into\n\u2018instincts\u2019 [is] \u2026 clearly understood to be a\ndevice of convenience only, similar to the arrangement of documents in\na well ordered filing system\u201d (1919, 309). Problems emerge, he\nthought, when psychologists reified those groupings, regarding them as\nnatural (as opposed to instrumental) categories. Dunlap argued that\nthis tendency encouraged psychologists to draw faulty inferences. For\nexample, \u201cHaving posited a \u2018pugnacious instinct,\u2019\n\u2026 one writer proceeds gravely to infer that war is forever a\nnecessity, as the expression of this instinct.\u201d (Dunlap 1919,\n309). From identifying pugnacity as a natural teleological category,\npsychologists inferred that it is developmentally fixed. Dunlap\nrecognized that this inference was empirically unwarranted.\n\nSocial psychologist Luther Lee Bernard (1921; 1924) also thought that\nambiguity in psychologists\u2019 use of \u201cinstinct\u201d\npromoted faulty inferences. As he explained, the typical instinct\ntheorist, \u201coften confuses both himself and the reader by such\nvagueness of speaking, for he may at one time mean only to emphasize\nthe automatic character of the act and at another he may fall back\nupon the recognized or approved meaning of the term, implying that\nautomatism is an inherited phenomenon\u201d (1921, 101). In other\nplaces, Bernard observed, instinct theorists would take developmental\nfixity as a sufficient condition for instinct, with \u201cany\nrelatively fixed or definite action pattern being pronounced an\ninstinct whether it is acquired or inherited\u201d (1921, 101). In\naddition to such inconsistencies, Bernard accused instinct theorists\nof remaining \u201cuntouched by the biological foundations of these\nsciences\u2026 [since] they have failed to grasp the true\nsignificance of Mendelian theory for the social and mental\nsciences\u201d (1921, 103). To illustrate, Bernard cited examples in\nwhich instinct theorists would posit the evolution of a\nspecies-typical instinct in just a few generations. Such rapid\nfixation violated basic principles of Mendelian inheritance as Bernard\nunderstood them. Bernard envisioned a future for social psychology\n\u201cthe practitioners of which fully recognized that nature and\nculture could not be separated\u201d (Cravens and Burnham 1971,\n654\u201355).\n\nPerhaps the fiercest critic of the concept of instinct was the\nBerkeley-educated Chinese psychologist Zing-Yang Kuo (Gu\u014d\nR\u00e8nyu\u01cen) who was dedicated to a Watsonian vision of\npsychology as an experimental science grounded on behaviorist\nprinciples (Honeycutt 2011). Kuo pejoratively referred to instinct\ntheory as \u201cfinished psychology\u201d because it discouraged\nresearchers from exploring the potential influences of learning early\nin an organism\u2019s life. As he explained, \u201c[t]he\npreconception of instinct has often betrayed the psychologist into\noverlooking the new environmental factors which are chiefly\nresponsible for the supposedly unlearned acts\u201d (Kuo 1921, 653).\nIn his earlier writings, Kuo (1921) admitted that certain\n\u201chereditary action units\u201d appear early in development and\ncould be classified as instincts, provided that they are viewed merely\nas developmental resources and not as functional behaviors (Honeycutt\n2011). However, this admission inspired critics, such as Geiger\n(1922), to object that Kuo was implicitly relying on the very concept\nof instinct which he purported to reject. This prompted Kuo (1924;\n1929) to revise his position, ultimately questioning the very\ndistinction between heredity vs acquired traits (Honeycutt 2011). His\nmain argument assumed that in order to identify some behavior as\nhereditary (as opposed to acquired), it would be necessary to identify\nthree things: (1) some fixed behavioral pattern, (2) the\nneuro-physiological mechanisms generating that pattern, and (3) a link\nto specific germ cells responsible for producing that mechanism. Kuo\nmaintained that there simply were no fixed behaviors, let alone ones\nthat could be associated with definite neuromuscular patterns\n(Honeycutt 2011). At the same time, available embryological evidence\n(e.g. Carmichael 1925) revealed that germ cells do not act\nindependently of environmental influences during development. Thus,\nKuo concluded that the very idea of a hereditary trait is,\n\u2018\u2018beyond any experimental approach, and will always remain\nas an unverifiable abstraction which serves no scientific purpose\nwhatever\u2019\u2019 (Kuo 1929, 195). A true scientist, Kuo argued,\nwould not be satisfied with labelling behavior\n\u2018instinctive\u2019 but would demand a causal analysis of its\norigin in the embryo, asking \u2018How are our Instincts\nAcquired?\u2019 (Kuo 1922, 344)\n\nFew psychologists went as far as Kuo in rejecting the concept of\nheredity in psychology (e.g. Tolman 1922). However, the criticisms of\nDunlap, Bernard, Kuo and others led to a rejection of instinct as a\nlegitimate topic of investigation, at least in North America. This\noccurred in conjunction with the rise of behaviorism and its focus on\nlearning theory as a framework for explaining animal and human\nbehavior.\n1.4 Ethology and the revival of instinct psychology\n\nDespite its eclipse by behaviorism in North America, the study of\ninstinct was rehabilitated in Europe on either side of World War Two\nby the founders of ethology, Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen\n(Tinbergen 1942; 1951; Lorenz 1957 (1937); Lorenz and Tinbergen 1957\n(1938)). Ethology was a Darwinian approach to behavior and the direct\nancestor of today\u2019s behavioral ecology and sociobiology. It\ntreated an organism\u2019s behavior as simply one more evolved\ncharacteristic alongside its skeleton and its digestive system. Innate\nbehavior was thought to be composed of identifiable units \u2013\n\u2018fixed action patterns\u2019 \u2013 whose evolution could be\nstudied like that of a bone by comparing the different form taken by\nthe same (homologous) behavior in different species. The evolutionary\nrelationships of birds, for example, were thought by the early\nethologists to be reflected in similarities and differences in their\ncourtship rituals as reliably as in similarities and differences in\ntheir bones.\n\nIn their early work, Lorenz and Tinbergen drew a sharp distinction\nbetween innate vs acquired behavior. An innate behavior was thought to\nbe, (1) stereotyped or constant in form, (2) species-typical, (3)\ncapable of developing in socially isolated animals, and (4) capable of\ndeveloping \u201cfully formed\u201d in animals which had been\ndeprived of opportunities to practice it (Lehrman 1953). Early\nethologists placed considerable emphasis on the \u2018deprivation\nexperiment\u2019 as a method for distinguishing innate from acquired\nbehaviors. These experiments involved raising an animal without the\nopportunity to learn a behavior and then testing to see if it can\nperform the behavior when provided with an appropriate stimulus. A\nsongbird, for example, can be raised from egg to adult without hearing\na member of its own species sing, and tested to see which song it\nproduces the following spring. If it produces the typical song of its\nown species, then the song was deemed innate. For more on Lorenz and\nTinbergen\u2019s ideas about instinct, see (Richards 1974; Griffiths\n2004; Brigandt 2005; Browne 2005; Burkhardt 2005).\n\nThe idea of instinct in classical ethology was strongly criticized by\nseveral North American psychologists including Theodore C. Schneirla\n(1952; 1963; 1966), Howard Moltz (1960; 1965), and most famously by\nSchneirla\u2019s student Daniel S. Lehrman in \u2018A critique of\nKonrad Lorenz\u2019s theory of instinctive behavior\u2019 (1953).\nLehrman objected to ethologists\u2019 resurrection of the innateness\nconcept on both empirical and theoretical grounds. Empirically,\nLehrman documented the role of environmental factors in the\ndevelopment of species-typical behavior patterns, drawing on many\nexisting studies, including some by Kuo. These experiments revealed\nthat certain prototypical fixed action patterns depend on\nenvironmental feedback for their development. This is true despite the\nfact that such behaviors are species-typical and present in animals\nthat were raised in isolation. For Lehrman, such evidence undermined\nthe attempt to distinguish innate from acquired behavior:\n\nin each case, analysis of the developmental process involved shows\nthat the behavior patterns concerned are not unitary, autonomously\ndeveloping things, but rather that they emerge ontogenetically in\ncomplex ways from the previously developed organization of the\norganism in a given setting. (Lehrman 1953, 343)\n\n\nLehrman was particularly critical of the use of the deprivation\nexperiment to infer that a certain trait is innate\nsimpliciter, rather than merely that the factors controlled\nfor in the experiment are not needed for the development of that\ntrait.\n\nMany of Lehrman\u2019s ideas were incorporated into mainstream\nethological theory. By the 1960s Tinbergen regarded the use of the\nterm \u2018innate\u2019 to characterize behaviors as\n\u201cheuristically harmful\u201d (Tinbergen 1963, 425) and endorsed\nLehrman\u2019s critique of the deprivation experiment: \u201cThe\nconclusion can only be formulated correctly in negative terms, in\ndescribing which environmental aspect was shown not to be\ninfluential\u201d (Tinbergen 1963, 424). In the same period Tinbergen\nand his students shifted the focus of their research from behaviors as\nstable taxonomic characters to behaviors as adaptations shaped by the\necological demands of the environment (Burkhardt 2005). Determining\nthe extent to which behavior develops independently of the environment\nceased to be important to the Tinbergen school, or to the new\ndiscipline of behavioral ecology in which students of Tinbergen like\nRichard Dawkins played such a prominent role. Interest turned instead\nto testing population genetic and game theoretic models of behavioral\nevolution.\n\nLorenz responded to his critics with a revised account of the\ninnate/acquired distinction (Lorenz 1965; see also Browne 2005). No\ntrait is innate in itself, but \u201ccertain parts of the information\nwhich underly the adaptedness of the whole, and which can be\nascertained by the deprivation experiment, are indeed innate\u201d\n(Lorenz 1965, 40). A trait is innate insofar as its development is\nguided by \u2018inherited information\u2019 rather than\n\u2018environmental information.\u2019 Lorenz defined\n\u2018information\u2019 in terms of adaptation. An adaptive trait\n\u2018fits\u2019 its environment and hence can be said to contain\ninformation about that environment just as a key can be said to\ncontain information about the lock it will open. The question is where\nthat information comes from \u2013 how does the organism\n\u2018know\u2019 about its environment? If a woman has calluses on\nher palms rather than on the backs of her hands, this represents\ninformation about where her skin gets rubbed most. If she were\nborn with calluses on her palms, as ostriches are born with\ncalluses that match pressure points on their legs, this would imply\nadvance \u2018knowledge\u2019 of where her skin is going to be\nrubbed most. Such anticipatory information, Lorenz argued, must be in\nthe genome. It is in the genome as a result of natural selection,\nwhich can be seen as a form of trial-and-error learning.\n\nLorenz\u2019s analysis can readily be expressed in\ninformation-theoretic terms, with the environment as the signal source\nand the organism as the receiver. Organisms need to reduce their\nuncertainty about what demands the environment will place on them and\nto develop in a way that meets those demands. There are two ways to do\nthis. The first way is to gather information about the environment\nduring development. The water flea Daphnia pulex monitors\nchemical traces of predators as it develops. If an individual flea\ndetects evidence that predators are present, then that flea grows\ndefensive armor. Thus, a flea\u2019s possession or lack of defensive\narmour reflects environmental information. The alternative is to\ninherit information from your ancestors. The human sickle cell allele\nhas harmful effects in homozygotes and survives in a population only\nbecause it confers resistance to malaria in heterozygotes. Hence the\nfact that an individual carries the allele provides information about\nthe prevalence of malaria in the ancestral environment and thus,\nprobably, in the environment of the organism which inherits the\nallele. The sickle cell allele can thus be seen as passing on\ninformation about the environment which was \u2018learnt\u2019 by\nancestors through natural selection. To the extent that the functional\nadjustment of a trait to its environment is explained by\n\u2018inherited information\u2019 of this kind, Lorenz argued, the\ntrait is innate. Hence, albeit in a very different way from Tinbergen,\nLorenz also came to see whether a behavior is an adaptation as the key\nissue.\n1.5 Nativism and the study of language acquisition\n\nClassical ethology flourished in the years immediately following World\nWar Two (Burkhardt 2005). At the same time others started to question\nthe emphasis on environmental factors in behavioral development which\nhad developed between the wars in the wake of the behaviorist\nrevolution in psychology. Numerous lines of evidence suggested that\npsychology would have to take account of species-specific biological\nendowments if it was to understand how different species interact with\ntheir environment and the distinctive things each species is able to\nlearn from these interactions (e.g. Harlow 1953; Tomkins 1962;\nSeligman 1970). By far the most influential criticism of behaviorism,\nhowever, came from linguistics. The linguist Noam Chomsky argued that\nexisting behaviorist accounts of the development of language were\nunworkable and offered a general argument for the conclusion that the\nability to acquire language is innate (Chomsky 1957; 1959; 1966).\nAccording to this \u2018poverty of the stimulus\u2019 argument, the\nexamples of speech to which children are exposed do not contain enough\nevidence to settle which utterances are grammatical in the language\nthey are trying to acquire. Nevertheless, children reliably acquire\nthe grammar of their native language. Therefore, Chomsky and his\nfollowers concluded, children must have innate knowledge about grammar\nwhich supplements the evidence to which they are exposed during\ndevelopment. If this argument is sound, every normal childhood is a\ndeprivation experiment that confirms the innateness of grammar. The\ndetails of the original poverty of the stimulus argument, its\nelaboration by Chomsky\u2019s followers, and the current state of the\nevidence for linguistic nativism are discussed in detail in the entry\n Innateness and Language.\n What matters for current purposes is that Chomsky\u2019s work\nproduced a very broad consensus in psychology that language\nacquisition is explained by a complex, evolved mechanism that is\npresent at birth and which can produce normal linguistic development\nin a wide range of environments, including those which are\n\u2018impoverished\u2019 with respect to language.\n\nThe \u2018language acquisition device\u2019 has served as an\nexemplar for research on whether other psychological and behavioral\ntraits are innate. Like the language acquisition device these\nputatively innate traits are supposed to explain patterns in the\ndevelopment of the child\u2019s mind. These patterns can be seen as\nrepresenting innate \u2018knowledge\u2019 or innate\n\u2018theories\u2019 about various cognitive domains. For example,\nthe eminent cognitive developmental psychologists Susan Carey and\nElizabeth Spelke argue that children possess four domains of innate\n\u2018core knowledge\u2019 which underlie much of their later\ncognitive development. These domains are \u2018objects, agents,\nnumbers and space\u2019 (Carey and Spelke 1996, 517). Children think\nabout each of these four domains in distinctive ways that do not seem\nto depend on the details of the child\u2019s environment. The\ndistinctive way in which children think about living, as opposed to\ninanimate, entities has also been proposed as a domain of innate\nknowledge (e.g. Medin and Atran 2004). The recent philosophical\nliterature on the concept of innateness which is outlined in later\nsections of this entry is mostly intended to analyse innateness as it\nis understood in this extensive body of \u2018neo-nativist\u2019\npsychology. The topic of\n innateness in language\n is covered separately. For a thorough introduction to this field and\nthe controversies arising from it, also see (Carruthers, et al. 2005;\n2007a; 2007b).\n1.6 Historical patterns\n\nThis historical overview of scientific debates over nativism reveals a\nfew general patterns. One is that there has never been an agreed\nscientific definition of an \u201cinstinctive\u201d or\n\u201cinnate\u201d trait. During the late 19th century\nC.L. Morgan noted the proliferation of different definitions of\ninstinct and criticized his contemporaries for their sloppy use of\nlanguage. The same criticisms are echoed in the work of Dunlap,\nBernard, and Kuo, who all complained that imprecision in the\ndefinition of \u201cinstinct\u201d led researchers to draw faulty\ninferences. Lehrman and other critics of the ethological revival of\ninstinct likewise complained that this concept lacked scientific\nprecision.\n\nA second general pattern is that such ambiguity was no barrier to the\nsheer volume of studies claiming to identify instincts. Indeed, it\nmight even be the case that lack of precision in the meaning of this\nterm fostered the growth of the instinct industry in late\n19th and early 20th century. A third general\npattern is the persistent complaint that instinct theorists ignore\nearly or subtle opportunities for learning. Wallace criticized Darwin\nfor failing to consider the influence of experience in early\ndevelopment. The same objection can be found in Kuo\u2019s criticism\nof instinct theory. Lehrman and his fellow critics likewise noted the\nfailure of ethologists to consider possible influences of experience\non development.\n\nDespite this troubled scientific history, versions of nativism\ncontinue to appear in psychology. In this century, Evolutionary\nPsychology has resuscitated a brand of nativism that is strikingly\nreminiscent of the instinct psychology that prevailed in the wake of\nDarwin and James (Hampton 2004). Part of what makes the recurrence of\nnativism philosophically interesting is that many scientists have\nnoted that the innate/acquired distinction is ultimately a false\ndichotomy (Kitcher 2001). All traits are influenced in their\ndevelopment by both environmental and genetic factors.\nWeismann\u2019s insistence on the distinction aside, it is a mistake\nto classify traits as emanating either from the germ line or the\nenvironment. Moreover, ever since Baldwin (1896) it has been thought\nthat complex behavioral adaptations can conceivably become fixed in a\npopulation by a process that relies heavily on experience. What then\nexplains the persistence of the innate/acquired distinction in\npsychology? The following section reviews recent attempts by\nphilosophers to identify what is at issue in disagreements over the\nmeaning and utility of nativism in psychology and biology.\n2. Philosophical diagnoses of the scientific debates\n\nThe previous section reviewed some of the arguments raised by\nscientists about the nature of instinct or innateness and the\nquestionable scientific utility of this concept. In this section, we\nconsider some recent proposals by philosophers to capture what is at\nissue in these debates. These philosophical diagnoses vary\nconsiderably, not only in their understanding of what is at issue, but\nalso in their methods. As we will see, this is one of the topics on\nwhich an \u2018experimental philosophy\u2019 (X-phi) approach has\nbeen put to productive use (see\n SEP entry\n on this topic). What follows is a review of five different\nphilosophical hypotheses about what is at issue in scientific debates\nover nativism.\n2.1 A matter of explanatory emphasis\n\nOne possible reason for the persistence of scientific debates over\nnativism is that researchers approach psychological development with\ndifferent explanatory interests. This idea was defended by Peter\nGodfrey-Smith (1996), who distinguished between\n\u201cexternalist\u201d and \u201cinternalist\u201d modes of\nexplanation in biology generally. Externalists \u201cexplain\nproperties of organic systems in terms of properties of their\nenvironments\u201d; whereas internalists explain, \u201cone set of\norganic properties in terms of the other internal or intrinsic\nproperties of the organic system\u201d (1996, 30 quoted in Cowie\n1998, 16). Nativism can be viewed as an internalist mode of\nexplanation in that it focuses on internal (e.g. genetic)\ncontributions to development while setting aside environmental\ninfluences. Conversely, anti-nativists like Kuo or Lehrman focus on\ncertain \u201cexternal\u201d (e.g. environmental) factors. On this\nview, the two approaches are not in conflict. Ultimately, it comes\ndown to the interests of an investigator where to place explanatory\nemphasis.\n\nIf this analysis is correct, then the resolution of debates over\nnativism should be straightforward. It should be sufficient to point\nout that the two perspectives are complementary: that both\n\u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d factors contribute\nto development. The problem with this analysis, however, is that it\nthreatens to trivialize the debate. Could it really be the case that\nsuch intellectual heavyweights as Lorenz and Lehrman were engaged in\nnothing more than a verbal dispute? Fiona Cowie (1998), for one, sees\nthis as a red flag. Although verbal disputes are not unheard of in\nscience and philosophy it is uncharitable to assume that all\nhistorical debates over nativism can be understood so simplistically.\nAs Cowie puts it, \u201c[v]iewing nativists and empiricists as\nquarreling merely over how \u2018important\u2019 the various factors\nin belief and concept acquisition are can incline us to see their\ndispute as insubstantial\u201d (1998, 22). We are well advised, she\nargues, to search for more substantial stakes in these debates.\n\nMore recently, James Tabery (2014) has developed an account of the\n\u201cinteraction debates\u201d (as he calls them) which also places\nexplanatory interests at the center of the disagreement. Tabery\nidentifies two general scientific approaches to the interaction\nbetween nature and nurture. So called \u201cvariation\npartitioners\u201d understand interaction in statistical terms. Their\nexplanatory aim is to identify the amount of actual variation\nexhibited by some phenotype that can be attributed to additive genetic\nvariance and environmental factors, respectively. A sharp distinction\nbetween innate versus acquired traits is central to this approach. By\ncontrast, Tabery\u2019s \u201cmechanism elucidators\u201d are\nprimarily interested in describing the developmental mechanisms\ngenerating particular phenotypes. These researchers understand\n\u201cinteraction\u201d in causal terms and tend to see little value\nin a sharp innate/acquired distinction.\n\nPhilosophers Slobodan Perovic and Ljiljana Radenovic (2011) have also\nsuggested that nativism/empiricism controversies might be dissolved by\nidentifying the different explanatory interests of the disputants.\nThey focus on the dispute between neo-nativist psychologists who see\nthemselves as heirs to Chomsky\u2019s linguistic nativism (Section\n1.5) and the intellectual descendants of anti-nativist developmental\npsychologists (Section 2.4) who believe that the distinction between\ninnate and acquired behavior is meaningless and that explaining\noutcomes of development by calling them \u2018innate\u2019 is\nscientifically vacuous (e.g. Oyama 1985; Ford and Lerner 1992; Michel\nand Moore 1995). According to Perovic & Radenovic these\nanti-nativists or \u2018developmental systems theorists\u2019 target\nneo-nativist claims about the pattern of gene-environment interaction\nin the development of cognition and behavior. Neo-nativists claim that\nthe pattern is maturational, with genes as specific causes and\nenvironmental factors as merely \u201cpermissive\u201d causes\n(Holtzer 1968). This is a fundamentally internalist form of\nexplanation, with external, environmental factors as mere background\nconditions and internal, genetic factors doing the real explanatory\nwork. However, while neo-nativist psychologists do make such claims,\nthey do not typically examine the developmental genetics of the traits\nwhich they claim are \u2018innate\u2019 (Gary Marcus (2004) is one\nimportant exception). Instead, their research examines specific stages\nin psychological development, often well into the life of the\nindividual, and specific environmental factors which might be thought\nto influence development at those stages. Their experiments aim to\nshow that the developmental outcome at such a stage is not\nspecifically influenced by the details of the environment, but instead\nfollows a pathway determined by internal cognitive structures. In one\nfamous body of research, children make an \u2018intellectual\nbreakthrough\u2019 at around age four when they come to properly\nunderstand the whole body of kinship terms in their local language,\nrather than treating categories like \u2018uncle\u2019 as defined by\nthe pattern of resemblance between uncles (Keil 1989). The fact that\nthis happens all at once, at around the same age, and despite a great\ndeal of variation in the specific kinship systems that children are\nlearning, supports the view that this transition is the result of an\ninternal, maturational change. While an environment of kinship\nstructures and kinship terms is needed, it functions as a merely\npermissive or background condition. The explanatory work is done by\nthe internal factors.\n\nPerovic & Radenovic (2011) point out that this claim about the\ncausal structure of development in a particular, late developmental\nstage is entirely compatible with the strongly interactionist view of\nhow genes and environment build the brain favoured by developmental\nsystems theorists. They suggest that neo-nativism is primarily\nconcerned to show that how organisms respond to their environments\ndepends strongly on cognitive structure that is in place before the\norganism encounters that environment. Conversely, anti-nativists are\nprimarily concerned to show that environments often play a specific,\ninstructive role in the development of cognitive structures. Since the\ntwo schools do such different research, the latter primarily focused\non human development post-partum and well into childhood, and the\nformer on early development, often in animal models for reasons of\nethical and experimental tractability, there is considerable scope for\naccounts of psychological development that draw on both perspectives\nat different stages of development. So, once again, on this account\ndisputes about nativism are fundamentally a reflection of scientists\ndifferent explanatory interests.\n2.2 Special-purpose faculties and the limits of empiricist science\n\nThe question, \u201cwhat are nativism debates about?\u201d has been\ncarefully analyzed by Fiona Cowie (1998), who distinguishes two\narguments historically deployed in defense of nativism. Poverty of\nthe stimulus arguments claim that the environment lacks\nsufficient information for an organism to learn some belief, cognitive\ndisposition, or behavior. If an individual nonetheless acquires that\ncognitive trait, then the process must have involved some amount of\n\u201cinnate\u201d information. A second type of argument, which\nCowie (1998) calls impossibility arguments, claim that\ncertain traits must be innate not because the environment is\nimpoverished, but rather because scientific accounts of the\nacquisition process are doomed to failure. This distinction leads\nCowie (1998) to propose two fundamental disagreements underlying\ndebates over nativism. The \u201cspecial faculties\u201d debate\nconcerns the basic architecture of the mind. Nativists posit\nspecial-purpose learning faculties to explain acquisition, whereas\nanti-nativists explain acquisition in terms of domain general\nlearning. The \u201cmystery\u201d debate, however, turns on a\nskeptical claim about the limits of scientific explanation. As Cowie\nexplains:\n\nImpossibility arguments\u2026 work to undermine the empiricist\nassumption that the processes underpinning our acquisition of ideas\nand beliefs are simply a species of natural phenomena, amenable at\nleast in principle to natural scientific explanation. (1998, 50)\n\n\nCowie is describing an extremely strong form of anti-empiricist\nskepticism. When directed at the explanatory prospects of science in\ngeneral it is unlikely that this brand of nativism will be appealing\nto naturalistic philosophers or scientists. However, skepticism of\nthis kind may be directed at specific scientific theories or\nexplanatory frameworks. Cowie (1998) discusses Jerry Fodor\u2019s\n(1975; 1981) peculiar-sounding hypothesis that most concepts \u2013\ne.g. our concept of a doorknob \u2013 are innate. On Cowie\u2019s\nreading, Fodor is offering an impossibility argument: concept\nacquisition cannot in principle be explained by an empiricist\nmodel of associative learning. The following section (2.3) looks more\nclosely at psychological primitivism, a more developed version of\nCowie\u2019s mystery hypothesis. The remainder of this section\nfocuses on the special-faculties hypothesis.\n\nCowie (1998; 2009) acknowledges a limitation of the special-faculties\nhypothesis. It applies only to debates in psychology over the\nkinds of learning process underlying the acquisition of beliefs or\nbehaviors. This is a problem because disputes about nativism are not\nconfined to psychology. For instance, we saw in the previous section\nthat Weismann (1891 (1888)) drew a sharp distinction between\nhereditary versus acquired traits generally. The special faculties\nhypothesis apparently cannot explain such non-psychological\ndisputes.\n\nOne potential way of rescuing the special-faculties hypothesis is to\nunderscore the difference between nativism in psychology compared to\ninnateness hypotheses in other disciplines, such as biology. Richard\nSamuels (2002), who does not defend the special-faculties hypothesis,\nnonetheless maintains that innateness is a distinctively psychological\nconcept. According to Samuels, to identify some trait as innate means\nabove all that it is unlearned, and to identify some trait as learned\nimplies that it is not innate. Samuels (2002) calls this the\nfundamental conceptual constraint on any analysis of\ninnateness. If Samuels is correct on this point, such that questions\nabout nativism are ultimately about the presence/absence of learning,\nthen it is no shortcoming of the special-faculties hypothesis that it\nfocuses on psychological traits. One noteworthy difference between\nCowie\u2019s special-faculties hypothesis and Samuels\u2019\nfundamental constraint is that the former distinguishes among learning\n\u201cmechanisms\u201d (general vs special purpose), whereas the\nlatter distinguishes more broadly between learned versus unlearned\ntraits.\n2.3 Innateness as a psychological primitive\n\nRichard Samuels (1998; 2002; 2004; 2007) has developed a version of\nCowie\u2019s mystery hypothesis called psychological primitivism. On\nthis view, that a belief or behavior is \u2018innate\u2019 means\nthat it serves as an explanatory primitive for psychological science.\nAn explanatory primitive is a concept that is deployed by a discipline\nto explain certain phenomena, but which cannot in principle be\nexplained by that discipline. Samuels maintains that there is a sharp\nexplanatory boundary between psychology and other fields. A necessary\ncondition for any psychological explanation, he claims, is that it\napply to the whole organism and not to a specific (sub-personal)\ncomponent (Samuels 1998). This condition excludes many explanations\ncouched in neurobiological terms, because they apply to sub-personal\ncomponents and not to the organism as a whole. However, there are\nother predicates that apply to the whole organism and yet do not\nqualify as psychological (e.g being a carnivore). So, the\npersonal/sub-personal distinction is not sufficient for marking the\nboundary that Samuels wants to draw. As a result it is not entirely\nclear how to draw the line between psychological and non-psychological\nphenomena. Samuels examples of psychological explanations feature\nprocesses such as conditioning, perception, and inference; whereas\nneurological and hormonal explanations purportedly fall outside\npsychology (Samuels 1998; 2002; 2004). Some authors criticize\nSamuels\u2019 primitivism on the grounds that this sharp distinction\nbetween psychology and other sciences does not exist (Gross and Rey\n2012; Linquist 2018). For example, psychological explanations of\ndepression and anxiety cite both intentional states and sub-personal\nprocesses as components of the same mechanism. The issue of how\npsychological explanations are related to biological explanations is\none of the most pressing questions in the philosophy of cognitive\nscience and has recently been explored in the context of debates over\nmechanistic explanation (see Gaj 2016; Milkowski, et al. 2019 for\nreviews).\n\nA further problem with Samuels\u2019s primitivism is that some\n\u201cbiological\u201d (i.e. not psychologically explainable) events\ncan have pronounced psychological effects over an individual\u2019s\nlifetime. For example, someone who undergoes brain trauma or suffers\nfrom the overuse of pharmaceuticals might thereby acquire certain\nbeliefs or behaviors. Phineas Gage, the 19th century\nrailroad worker who became famous for surviving a massive brain\ninjury, is reported to have acquired several new personality traits\nafter an iron rod pierced his prefrontal cortex (Twomey 2010). Samuels\nworries that according to primitivism such traits would be innate\nsince they cannot, by hypothesis, be explained in psychological terms.\nHe worries that this would be highly counterintuitive.\n\nTo avoid such implications, Samuels shores up his proposal with a\nproviso: a psychological structure is innate just in case it is\npsychologically primitive and it would develop under normal\nconditions for a member of the species. This move has prompted\nsome philosophers to generate further counterexamples of acquired\ntraits that are psychologically unexplainable but nonetheless emerge\nunder \u201cnormal\u201d conditions (e.g. Khalidi 2007). A deeper\nquestion, however, concerns the very notion of a \u201cnormal\u201d\ndevelopmental environment. Spelling out this idea is no easy matter.\nPresumably, a necessary condition for some environment to qualify as\nnormal for a species is that it was encountered ancestrally. But this\nraises the twin problems of how far back in time is relevant, and how\ncan we classify environments as types. Samuels argues that these\nproblems plague any discipline that appeals to the notion of a normal\nenvironment and are thus not unique to psychology. However, it remains\nan open question whether the concept of normal environment can made\ncoherent. We return to this issue in Section 3.4 (below).\n2.4 I-properties and the clutter hypothesis\n\nAs we discussed in Section 1, for more than 150 years there has been\ndisagreement over how to define instinctive (or innate) traits in a\nway that is useful to scientific psychology. Shortly after instinct\nhad become a topic of scientific study, C.L. Morgan (1896) identified\nseven \u201cdefinitional\u201d issues surrounding this term. Two\ndecades later, criticisms by Knight Dunlap (1919) and L.L. Bernard\n(1921) reveal that those ambiguities had not been resolved. It is also\ntelling that Lorenz continued to modify his definition of innateness\nin response to critics over the course of his career, while Tinbergen\neventually abandoned this term altogether. More recently, behavioral\nbiologist Patrick Bateson has observed that, \u201c[a]t least six\nmeanings are attached to the term [innate]: present at birth; a\nbehavioral difference caused by a genetic difference; adapted over the\ncourse of evolution; unchanging throughout development; shared by all\nmembers of a species; and not learned\u201d (1991, 21). His objection\nis not merely that the term \u201cinnate\u201d is ambiguous. Like\nDunlap (1919) and Bernard (1921), his complaint is that ambiguity\npromotes equivocation, encouraging researchers to draw faulty\ninferences as they slide between different senses of innateness. For\nexample, if a trait is deemed \u201cinnate\u201d because there is\nevidence that it is present at birth, psychologists will sometimes\ninfer (without further evidence) that it is therefore\n\u201cinnate\u201d in the sense of being insensitive to\nenvironmental influence. Developmental biologists since Kuo (1921)\nhave provided evidence against this easy inference. Bateson\u2019s\nown work on the phenomenon of parental imprinting in birds (Bateson,\n1966) showed that traits which appear early in life are often highly\nsensitive to specific environmental factors. The tendency for nativism\nto promote such unwarranted inferences has been one of the main\nreasons why many scientists have called for dramatic revision or even\nan elimination of this concept from scientific discourse (see Section\n4.5 of this entry).\n\nPaul Griffiths (2002) has clarified what is ontologically at stake in\nthis objection to nativism. Researchers who draw questionable\ninferences about the properties associated with innateness are\nassuming (implicitly, if not explicitly) that innateness is a natural\nkind. More specifically, they assume that innate traits form what\nRichard Boyd (1989) called a homeostatic property cluster.\nSuch property clusters require the existence of some causal process\nthat \u201cholds together\u201d the relevant properties in a\ncoherent bundle, so to speak. For example, Weismann assumed that the\nonly way for a trait to be modified by natural selection is if it\ndevelops \u201cdirectly\u201d from germline cells. He also assumed\nthat germline cells were the only possible source of developmental\nstability since environmental factors were seen exclusively as a\nsource of developmental noise (Johnston 1995). Thus, on\nWeismann\u2019s picture, the properties of being an adaptation and\nbeing developmentally stable were a part of the same homeostatic\ncluster. It turns out that Weismann\u2019s picture of development was\ntoo narrow. The environment is much more than just a source of noise.\nCertain environmental factors are a source of developmental stability\n(West-Eberhard 2003), acting as a \u201cscaffold\u201d for the\ndevelopment of particular traits (Sterelny 2003). The environment can\nalso store information that organisms rely on during development to\ngenerate adaptive phenotypes (Mameli 2004). So, contra Weismann, there\nis no distinct causal process associated with germline cells that\naccounts for developmental stability and adaptation. Without a known\nprocess to unify the various properties associated with innateness,\nGriffiths (2002) argues, the assumption that they form a homeostatic\ncluster is unwarranted.\n\nThis position was developed in Bateson\u2019s later work with\nphilosopher Matteo Mameli (Mameli and Bateson 2006; 2011; Bateson and\nMameli 2007). Expanding on Bateson\u2019s (1991) original list, they\nidentify a total of twenty-six candidate definitions of innateness in\nthe scientific and philosophical literature (Mameli and Bateson 2006).\nMany of these proposals are deemed unsatisfactory because \u201cthey\nappeal to unclear, unexplained, or controversial notions such as\n\u2018genetic information\u2019, \u2018learning\u2019,\n\u2018developmental induction\u2019, and \u2018normal\ndevelopment\u2019\u201d (2006, 176). Other candidate definitions are\nrejected by Mameli and Bateson because they fail to pick out any trait\nwhatsoever. For instance, no trait is (strictly speaking) genetically\ndetermined or unacquired. Other candidates are rejected because they\napply to all possible traits. For example, every trait is (to some\ndegree) genetically influenced or insensitive to the environment. By\nthe end of their analysis, Mameli and Bateson arrive at a shortlist of\njust eight candidates. These \u201ci-properties\u201d (as they call\nthem) are relatively promising definitions in that they suffer from no\nobvious conceptual or empirical shortcoming. Their shortlist of\ncandidate definitions for \u201cinnate\u201d are as follows:\n\nIt appears reliably at a particular stage of the lifecycle.\nIt develops abnormally in response to environmental manipulations\nwhich were not encountered in the organism\u2019s evolutionary\nhistory.\nIt is not produced by a developmental mechanism that evolved to\ngenerate different phenotypes in response to particular environmental\nconditions (i.e., adaptive phenotypic plasticity), and it is also not\nthe result of exposure to abnormal environmental conditions.\nAny modification to the trait would have a negative impact on the\ndevelopment of other traits (the \u2018generatively\nentrenchment\u2019 of Schank and Wimsatt 1986).\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes during\ndevelopment.\nIt is insensitive to certain environmental changes after\ndevelopment.\nThe trait is species typical.\nThe trait is a standard Darwinian adaptation.\n\n\nMameli and Bateson maintain that it is an empirical question whether\nany of these properties cluster together. Moreover, they propose that\nin the absence of a known unifying causal process, we should not\nassume that they do cluster. Mameli (2008) has dubbed this the\n\u201cclutter hypothesis\u201d (in contrast to \u201ccluster\nhypothesis\u201d). Their work has inspired some recent philosophical\ndiscussion over which hypothesis (clutter or cluster) is best\nsupported by available evidence and theory. For instance, Nicholas\nShea (2012) argues that recent developments in evolutionary and\ndevelopmental biology suggest that i-properties do not cluster. In\ncontrast, Muhammad Ali Khalidi (2016) argues that innateness\nproperties do cluster provided that we focus strictly on\npsychology and not biology (assuming that such a distinction can be\ndrawn). This question remains an important area for future\nresearch.\n\nAlthough the clutter hypothesis captures what is ontologically at\nstake in debates over nativism, it does not explain why the associated\nconceptual confusion has been so difficult to resolve. Admittedly,\nambiguities are by no means unknown to science (Cowie 2009; Samuels\n2007). However, the tenacity of nativism debates in psychology seems\nunusual. One might reasonably expect that psychologists would have, by\nnow, disambiguated this concept and developed experimental criteria\nfor detecting specific i-properties. Such questions as whether a trait\nis present at birth, a functional adaptation, developmentally\nsensitive to some environmental factor, and so on should be regarded\nby psychologists as independent research hypotheses (Griffiths 2002).\nOn the contrary, there is a stubborn tendency to conflate these issues\nby simply asking whether some trait is \u201cinnate.\u201d Even\namong researchers who acknowledge on the one hand that\n\u201cinnate\u201d is a multiply ambiguous term will, in other\ncontexts, slide between different i-properties apparently without\nrealizing it (Linquist et al. 2011). Such observations have prompted a\nnumber of recent questionnaire experiments, conducted largely by\nphilosophers, analyzing the \u201cfolk\u201d concept of innateness\nand comparing it to scientific conceptions.\n2.5 Folk essentialism and the psychological attraction of nativism\n\nGriffiths (2002) offered a testable psychological hypothesis to\nexplain the recalcitrance of nativism in psychology and potentially\nother disciplines. The basic idea is that the concept of innateness is\na cornerstone of \u201cfolk biology\u201d (Medin and Atran 1999;\n2004), the pre-theoretical beliefs that people intuitively use to\nunderstand biological systems. Part of folk biology involves the\nclassification of organisms into species-like groupings. These\nclassifications sometimes overlap with scientific classifications, but\noften they diverge. For example, a folk biological classification\nmight identify horses, roses, and octopuses as species-like groupings,\nwhen in fact each of these biological categories contain numerous\nspecies, some of which are morphologically and phylogenetically\ndisparate.\n\nFolk biology also departs from scientific classification in its\nessentialist commitments. Across a wide range of cultures, people tend\nto assume that members of each species possess a common essence or\ncausal nature that determines their appearance, behavior, and\necological roles (Medin and Atran 2004). Psychologists have found that\neven when people have no specific ideas about the nature of a\nparticular species, they nonetheless assume that it must have an\nessence (i.e. they operate with what Medin and Ortony (1989) call an\n\u201cessence placeholder\u201d). It is plausible that folk\nessentialism has served our species well for most of its history.\nMedin and Atran (2004) propose that the existence of an essence\nplaceholder might have motivated people to explore their environments,\nleading them to discover and share information about edible or\nmedicinal plants, about dangerous plants and animals, and other\nsalient aspects of the environment. The idea of an essence might also\nhave assisted humans in tasks associated with agriculture and animal\nhusbandry. Despite its utility, however, essentialism is\nscientifically inaccurate. No internal essence explains why members of\na species share certain traits. Although genetic similarities account\nfor some of the traits that are typical of a species, it is misleading\nto think of a species\u2019 genome as its essence. Elliott Sober\n(1980) provides a detailed account of what is wrong with this idea.\nEssentialism, he notes, employs a Natural State Model of explanation\nwhich views every member of a species as directed toward a single\ndevelopmental outcome (natural state). Essentialists recognize that\nindividuals vary in the characteristics they actually express.\nHowever, such variability is explained according to essentialism by\npositing the effects of intervening forces that interrupt development\nand prevent the full realization of its goal. The reason that\nindividuals of the same sex differ in their sexual preference, on this\nview, is because of slightly different environmental factors impinging\non the development of these individuals. By contrast, on a\nneo-Darwinian model there is no natural state. Individual variability\nis partly explained in terms of genetic variation passed on from one\ngeneration to the next. Moreover, even given a specific genetic\nstarting point, development is not aiming at some specific, natural\nstate, but simply goes wherever local causes push it. The interaction\nbetween genetic and environmental factors is most accurately\nrepresented as a norm of reaction (see Section 3.2 below), where a\nspectrum of developmental outcomes is associated with each unique\ngenotype in a population of genetically variable individuals. This\nneo-Darwinian perspective requires a fairly dramatic shift in\nconventional thinking about species. As Atran et al. (2002, 32) put\nit, \u201cto understand modern biological science, people must\nunlearn universal dispositions to view species\nessentialistically\u201d.\n\nGriffiths (2002) hypothesized that folk essentialism might be exerting\nan influence even on scientists\u2019 and philosophers\u2019\nprofessional judgments about innateness. More precisely, the\nhypothesis states that (1) there is a \u201cfolk\u201d or vernacular\nconcept of innateness that most people operate with in non-technical\ncontexts, (2) this vernacular concept is incompatible with scientific\ndevelopments in such fields as evolutionary and developmental biology,\nand (3) that researchers working in psychology and perhaps other\ndisciplines will employ the vernacular concept of innateness (often\ninadvertently) even when reasoning in a scientific context. Machery et\nal. (2019) have more recently dubbed this the \u201cattractor\nhypothesis\u201d of innateness, because of its similarity to the idea\nof a psychological attractor in cultural evolution (Sperber 1996;\nClaidi\u00e8re and Sperber 2007). An implication of the attractor\nhypothesis of innateness is that the concept of an innate trait will\nbe highly resistant to scientific revision. Despite attempts to refine\nthe concept, researchers will continue to default to the vernacular\nconcept, the theory goes, and draw faulty inferences despite their\nefforts to avoid equivocation. Griffiths (2002) draws the normative\nconclusion that the concept of innateness should be self-consciously\neliminated from scientific discourse. This proposal will be discussed\nbelow (Section 3.5). The remainder of this subsection discusses recent\nexperimental evidence surrounding the attractor hypothesis of\ninnateness.\n\nPhilosophers have devised a number of questionnaire studies exploring\nthe structure of the vernacular concept of innateness (Griffiths, et\nal. 2009; Linquist et al. 2011; Knobe and Samuels 2013) and whether\nthe vernacular concept features in scientists\u2019 judgments about\ninnateness (Knobe and Samuels 2013; Machery et al. 2019). Drawing\nagain from the psychological literature on folk biology, Griffiths et\nal. (2009) identified three features that are thought to be central to\nthe vernacular concept of innateness:\n\nFixity: Innate traits are insensitive to environmental influences\nduring development.\nTypicality: Innate traits are shared by most adult members of the\nsame species or sex.\nFunction: Innate traits serve some purpose or end for the\norganism.\n\n\nThe authors tested this \u201cthree feature theory\u201d (as they\ncall it) using a questionnaire describing examples of birdsong that\ndiffered in Fixity, Typicality, and Function. The aim was to determine\nthe extent to which each factor independently contributes to\nfolk judgments about innateness. This experiment was first conducted\non na\u00efve or non-expert subjects with the aim of first determining\nthe structure of the vernacular concept before examining its potential\nrole in expert (scientific) judgments. As predicted, evidence of\nFixity was enough for na\u00efve subjects to agree that a trait is\ninnate, even if the trait lacks Typicality and Function. Evidence of\nTypicality also independently drove innateness judgments, as did\nFunctionality (though to a lesser degree). The authors take these\nresults to provide a fine-grained analysis of the vernacular concept\nof innateness, revealing just how easily people are prompted to\nclassify a given trait as \u201cinnate.\u201d In a later study,\nLinquist et al. (2011) expanded the survey to test whether Fixity,\nTypicality, and Function also influence naive subjects\u2019\njudgments about whether a trait is \u201cin the DNA.\u201d They\nfound that the two phrases (\u201cinnate\u201d and \u201cin the\nDNA\u201d) draw upon the same underlying folk concept. Linquist et\nal. (2011) also cite examples where researchers in psychology and\nbiology employ the folk concept in drawing unjustified inferences\namong i-properties. It is important to note that although these x-phi\nexperiments are quite limited, their findings are confirmed by a much\nlarger body of experimental work in social psychology on the\n\u2018genetic essentialist framework\u2019 in folk cognition\n(Dar-Nimrod and Heine 2006; 2011; Cheung, et al. 2014). For a side by\nside-comparison of the two models see Stotz and Griffiths (2018).\n\nLinquist and collaborators (2011) predicted that scientists would\ncontinue rely on the vernacular concept of innateness when reasoning\nin a professional context. This prediction was confirmed by Knobe and\nSamuels (2013) who compared na\u00efve subjects\u2019 responses to\nthe same birdsong questionnaire that was developed by Griffiths et al.\n(2009). As the attractor hypothesis predicts, they found that\nscientific training had no effect on a person\u2019s judgments about\ninnateness. Scientists were just as likely as lay people to classify a\ntrait as innate it if exhibits one of Typicality, Fixity or Function.\nThis result went against Knobe and Samuels (2013) own expectations\nthat professional scientists would exhibit a different response\npattern from laypersons. A subsequent analysis of Knobe and\nSamuels\u2019 (2013) data by Machery et al. (2019) took a\nfiner-grained look at how different categories of scientist responded\nto questions about innateness. They found no significant difference\namong psychologists, linguists, and biologists in their responses to\nthe birdsong questionnaire. This finding supports the attractor\nhypothesis and goes against the rival expectation that the concept of\ninnateness functions differently in psychology or linguistics than it\ndoes in biology. Interestingly, however, Knobe and Samuels (2013) also\nasked researchers how \u201cimportant\u201d the concept of\ninnateness is in their discipline. In this case, there was a\nsignificant difference among disciplines, with biologists ranking it\nless important than psychologist or linguists.\n\nOne must be cautious before reading too much significance into these\nresults since the sample size of scientists was fairly small (Machery\net al. 2019), the questionnaire offered only a limited glimpse into\nthe folk concept of innateness (Samuels 2016), and the questions\npresented (on birdsong) might have been more familiar to certain\ndisciplines (e.g. to biologists) than they were to others. This topic\nis ripe for future research. That said, a few additional results\nreported by Knobe and Samuels (2013) are worth mentioning.\n\nIn one of their experiments the authors manipulated the way in which\nbirdsong was described. In one condition, birds were described as\n\u201clearning\u201d their song. In another condition, the same\nacquisition process was described in neurological terms: birds were\ndescribed not as learning their songs, but rather as acquiring songs\nthrough specific neurological interactions with the environment.\nRecall that primitivism (Section 2.3) predicts that a trait described\nas \u201cunlearned\u201d should be less likely to be seen as innate\nthan one which is described as the result of a sub-personal,\nneurological process. The fact that subjects responded no differently\nto the \u201clearned\u201d versus \u201cneurological\u201d\nversions of the questionnaire (regardless of whether they were\nscientists or lay persons) contradicts this prediction of primitivism.\nIt is also interesting to note that Knobe and Samuels (2013) found an\neffect of moral \u201cvalence\u201d on innateness judgments. If a\nbehavior was morally unacceptable, subjects were less likely to judge\nit as innate than if it was morally good. This result ties in with a\nbroader literature on the influence of moral valence on all manner of\nfolk judgments (Knobe and Mendlow 2004; Cushman, et al. 2008; Petit\nand Knobe 2009). Finally, Knobe and Samuels (2013) included another\nversion of the birdsong questionnaire in which subjects were told how\ndifferent vignettes varied from one another, while also prompting\nsubjects to justify their responses. This was interpreted by the\nauthors as a \u201creflective\u201d condition, with the aim of\nprompting subjects to answer more systematically. Knobe and Samuels\n(2013) report that subjects responded more systematically under the\n\u201creflective\u201d condition than they did under the\nunreflective one, suggesting that even na\u00efve subjects will be\nless likely to equivocate in their judgments if they are prompted to\ndo so (see Linquist 2018 for a discussion of this result). All of the\nexperiments reported in this section are suggestive and offer an\ninteresting example of how empirical methods can be used to analyze\nboth folk and scientific concepts. Hopefully other researchers will be\ninspired to carry this work forward.\n3. Revisionist and Eliminativist Proposals\n\nPhilosophers have suggested three ways to avoid future iterations of\nthe nature versus nurture debate. First, revisionist proposals aim to\nrestrict the definition of \u201cinnate\u201d to a subset of the\ni-properties outlined by Mameli and Bateson (see Section 2.4).\u00a0\nPerhaps if scientists converge on a single meaning, problems\nassociated with equivocation will decrease, and psychology generally\nwill undergo conceptual progress. Second, eliminativist proposals\nargue that while conceptual revision sounds like a nice idea it is\nunlikely to succeed. A more practical approach, eliminitivists\nsuggest, is to discard innatness as a serious scientific construct. A\nthird strategy, outlined by Cowie (2009) is to do nothing. Vagueness\naround the innate acquired distinction has caused, on her view, no\ninhibition to scientific progress. In this section we review some\nrecent revisionist proposals, attempts to establish a single, clear\ndefinition. Eliminativism and the \u201cdo nothing\u201d proposals\nare considered in Section 3.5.\n3.1 Innateness as genetic specification\n\nAccording to our intuitive or \u201cfolk\u201d conception of\ninnateness, a trait qualifies as innate if it is either typical of\nmost members of the species, or if it is developmentally buffered\nagainst certain environmental factors, or if it is an evolutionary\nadaptation (Griffiths, et al. 2009). It might be argued that all three\nof these properties are coextensive with traits that are genetically\nspecified: 1. Species-typicality is explained, on this view, by the\nfact that members of each species share a common pool of genes. 2.\nSome genes are developmentally buffered against certain environmental\nfactors, such that within some range of variation those factors do not\nimpact the expression of those genes. 3. Finally, many biologists see\nthe gradual accumulation of genetic mutations as the primary mechanism\nallowing phenotypes to undergo evolutionary adaptation. Putting these\nideas together, it might seem plausible to cash out the folk\nconception of innateness in terms of genetic information. More\nprecisely, a trait could be described as more or less innate depending\non the extent to which its development is guided by genetic\ninformation. One potential advantage of this analysis is that it can\nmake sense of the dispositional nature of certain \u201cinnate\u201d\ntraits. Many traits have a late developmental onset, such as those\nassociated with puberty in humans. Their developmental fixity, their\nspecies typicality, and their functionality can lead people to judge\nthese traits as \u201cinnate\u201d despite not being present early\nin life. This judgment makes sense if innate traits are those which\nare genetically specified, since the genetic predisposition to develop\ncertain characters is present in the organism from conception.\n\nDespite these apparent advantages, most philosophers reject this\nproposal. As Elliott Sober (1988; 2000) points out, when speaking\nabout a particular trait in a particular organism \u2013 such as the\nreader\u2019s own height \u2013 it makes no sense to ask how much of\nthat individual trait was determined by genes and how much by the\nenvironment. All traits require both genetic and environmental factors\nfor their development. Thus, one cannot isolate these causal factors\nin a way that would allow for the comparison of their relative\nphenotypic contributions. We cannot ask, for example, how an organism\nwould develop in an \u201cenvironmental vacuum\u201d because it\nwould not develop at all. Sober further notes that genetic and\nenvironmental contributions are incommensurable. If you are six feet\ntall, we cannot sensibly ask how much of your height came from your\ngenes and how much came from your environment. There are no\n\u201cheight particles\u201d produced by both genes and environments\nthat add up to determine your height (Sober 1988). Genes and\nenvironment both make contributions, but not contributions that can be\ntaken apart and then weighed separately. Yet the folk concept of\ninnateness clearly applies to particular traits in particular\nindividuals: Donald Trump\u2019s eyes are innately grey-blue but his\nskin is not innately orange. Such statements cannot be meaningfully\ntranslated into statements about the relative contributions of genes\nend environment to Trump\u2019s eyes or Trump\u2019s skin.\n\nThe scientific discipline that does meaningfully address questions of\nthe relative contributions of genes and environment is quantitative\ngenetics. It does so by shifting its focus from the individual to the\npopulation. Instead of investigating individuals, quantitative\ngeneticists focus on populations comprised of genetically\nvariable individuals. Instead of asking how genetic and environmental\nfactors influence the development of an individual, this discipline\nfocuses on how each factor influences phenotypic differences\nin a population. It is important to understand how this focus on\npopulation-level phenotypic differences impacts judgments about\nwhether a given trait is \u201cgenetic.\u201d An obvious limitation\nof this approach is that it can be applied only to traits that exhibit\nphenotypic variation. Take some trait that is invariant, such as all\nhumans having one head. Without variation in this trait, it is not\npossible to conduct a population-level analysis to determine the\nextent to which this trait is genetically encoded. There are no\nphenotypic differences at the population level, and so no\ndistinguishable genetic contribution to those differences (see\n SEP entry\n on heritability). This is, again, at odds with our vernacular notion\nof innateness, which would surely judge the human head to be an innate\ntrait. Indeed, typicality (or invariance) is one of the driving\nfactors in folk judgments of innateness (Griffiths, et al. 2009), so\nthe conventional scientific method for evaluating genetic\ncontributions to trait development is at odds with our folk intuitions\nfor this reason alone.\n\nAnother implication of this approach is that judgments about the\nmagnitudes of genetic vs environmental contributions are relative to a\nspecific population and to a particular environment. Changing either\none of these contextual factors can alter the extent to which some\ntrait is deemed genetic. For example, suppose that a quantitative\ngeneticist is interested in growing large corn plants. She sets out to\ncompare two different corn genotypes (G1 and G2) across two different\nfertilizer treatments (E1 and E2). Suppose that G2 grows larger than\nG1 by exactly 5 units in both E1 and E2. This would lead our\nresearcher to conclude that the observed variation in corn height is\ndue entirely to genetic differences. We might further infer that the\ntrait of height in corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic\nthan by environmental factors. However, this judgment is contingent on\nthe comparison class that our researcher has chosen. Imagine another\nscenario in which G2 is compared to yet another genotype (G3). This\ntime, our researcher compares E2 to E3, a third fertilizer treatment\ndistinct from E1. Further suppose that G2 and G3 grow to the same\nheight in E2, but that G3 is five units larger than G2 in E3. In this\ncase, a comparison based on population differences suggests that the\nfocal trait is more strongly influenced by environmental than by\ngenetic factors. Let us now focus just on G2 in E2, and ask whether\nheight in these corn plants is more strongly influenced by genetic or\nenvironmental factors? Sober (1988) uses a similar example to\nillustrate that any answer to this question is contingent on the\ncomparison class one chooses. If we compare G2/E2 to G1/E1, then\nheight differences come out as genetically influenced; but if we\ncompare G2/E2 to G3/E3, then height differences come out as\nenvironmentally influenced. Hence, judgments about the relative\nmagnitudes of genetic versus environmental contributions are\ninherently \u201cnon-local\u201d or context sensitive.\n\nSome philosophers take this as sufficient grounds for rejecting any\nanalysis of innateness in terms of genetic contributions (e.g. Khalidi\n2007). The worry is that there is no canonical comparison class for\nevaluating the relative contributions of genetic and environmental\ninfluences. Different researchers will select different alleles and\ndifferent environments for investigating a given trait and there is no\nnon-arbitrary way to determine which is the \u201ccorrect\u201d\ncomparison class. Insofar as innateness is not a context sensitive\nconcept, but the magnitude of genetic contribution is highly context\nsensitive, innateness cannot be defined as magnitude of genetic\ncontribution. One way to potentially avoid this implication is by\nspecifying a canonical or \u201cnormal\u201d range of environments.\nIn this view, a trait is relatively innate to the extent that genetic\n(as opposed to environmental) factors explain phenotypic differences\nacross the normal range of environments. This proposal will be\nconsidered more carefully in the following section (Section 3.2)\nInterested readers might refer to entries on\n Gene\n and\n Biological Information).\n\nAnother way to potentially avoid the context-sensitivity objection is\nto develop some other method of quantifying genetic vs environmental\ncontributions to phenotypes. We saw earlier (Section 1) that Lorenz\nattempted to define innate traits in terms of the extent to which they\nare encoded by genetic information. This proposal places\nemphasis on the concept of information and whether it is possible to\ncompare traits according to the relative amounts to which they are\nstructured by genetic information. A general problem with this\napproach is that genes do not contain information about traits,\nstrictly speaking. As Peter Godfrey-Smith has noted, \u2018All the\ngenes can code for, if they code for anything, is the primary\nstructure (amino acid sequence) of a protein\u2019 (Godfrey-Smith\n1999, 328). Considered as a language, the genetic code can only refer\nto the twenty-three standard amino acids and can only say which order\nto put them in. The only exceptions to this are the\n\u2018start\u2019 and \u2018stop\u2019 codons which affect where\nDNA transcription begins and ends. Many other things happen as a\ndownstream causal consequence of the order of amino acids, but to\nparaphrase Godfrey Smith\u2019s argument, genes do not \u2018code\nfor\u2019 these downstream causal consequences for the same reason\nthat President Nixon\u2019s order to cover up the Watergate scandal\nwas not an \u2018order\u2019 to get himself impeached by Congress.\n\u2018Coding for\u2019, like \u2018ordering\u2019 and other\nsemantic locutions, is not merely another name for\n\u2018causing\u2019. The idea that the \u2018genetic program\u2019\nor \u2018genetic instructions\u2019 for phenotypes are literally\nwritten in the genetic code is a continuing barrier to the public\nunderstanding of genetics, one that is reinforced every time a\njournalist reports that scientists have \u2018decoded\u2019 the gene\nfor something. In reality there are no tiny \u2018traitunculi\u2019\nhidden in the genome awaiting a sufficiently powerful genetic\nmicroscope to read them (Schaffner 1998, 2016).\n\nBut although the sequences of nucleotides in the genome do not\nliterally \u2018code for\u2019 phenotypic traits, they are, of\ncourse, amongst the causes of phenotypic traits. Several philosophers\nand scientists have introduced technical definitions of \u2018genetic\ninformation\u2019 based on these causal relationships in order to\nexplicate the intuitive idea that genes carry information about\nphenotypes. These proposals are discussed in more detail in the entry\n Biological information.\n Here we will simply make two points about these proposals. The first\npoint is that there are some very straightforward senses in which\ngenes \u2018carry information\u2019 about phenotypes. The human Y\nchromosome carries information about sex in the same way that\n\u2018smoke means fire\u2019: one can be predicted from the other.\nIn addition, the SRY region on the Y-chromosome is an adaptation for\nmaking organisms into males, so we can apply a version of\n\u2018teleosemantics\u2019, an approach which defines information in\nterms of adaptation, to this piece of DNA (Sterelny, et al. 1996; Shea\n2007 and see the entry on\n Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n The second point is that these straightforward senses of\n\u2018information\u2019 also seem to be applicable to environmental\ncauses in development (Oyama 1985; Griffiths and Gray 2005). Mammals\nhave a chromosomal system of sex-determination. But many reptiles use\ntemperature, an environmental signal, to switch genetically identical\neggs between male or female developmental pathways. Other reptiles\nhave a genetic system which can be overridden by an environmental\nsignal. Some fish even switch sex in adulthood in response to\nenvironmental cues. These environmental signals carry information\nabout sex in the same unproblematic \u2018smoke means fire\u2019\nsense as the SRY gene. Moreover, the behaviors that parents use to\ngive appropriate cues to their eggs, and some of the products of those\nbehaviors, such as nests of rotting vegetation which maintain a\nsuitable temperature range, are designed by natural selection to\nensure the correct sex-ratio in offspring, so the teleosemantic\nprogram can be applied to them too. The idea that genes \u2018carry\ninformation\u2019 about phenotypes in a special sense which\ndistinguishes them from other causes is not the piece of common-sense\nit is often taken to be, but rather a highly contested idea that is\nthe focus of much work in the philosophy of biology. See the entry on\n Biological Information.\n3.2 Developmental invariance and the norm of reaction\n\nThe previous section touched on the fact that judgments about the\nrelative contributions of genetic vs environmental factors to trait\ndifferences are context sensitive. They are sensitive to both the\nallelic combinations that a researcher studies and also to range of\nenvironments that a researcher includes in her analysis. Quantitative\ngeneticists recognize that a given genetic variant (allele) will have\nvariable phenotypic effects across different environments. These\nresponses are often nonlinear, such that gradual increases in an\nenvironmental parameter do not have correspondingly gradual phenotypic\neffects. At the same time, different genetic variants (alleles)\ncompared against a single environment will often produce a range of\nphenotypic effects. Quantitative geneticists typically represent these\ninteractions with a graphical tool called the norm of reaction. These\ndiagrams were introduced at around the same time as the idea of the\ngene and the distinction between genotype and phenotype (Sarkar 1999)\nand have long been advocated as the clearest way to think about the\nrole of genes in development (Hogben 1933; Lewontin 1974; Gottlieb\n1995; Kitcher 2001). Suppose, for example, that with respect to some\nenvironmental variable (E) an organism with a given genotype (G1) will\ndevelop the same phenotype (P) way no matter what value the\nenvironmental variable takes (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. A norm of reaction in which\nthe phenotype P is \u2018genetically determined\u2019\n\n\nIf a norm of reaction has this shape, we can say that P is\n\u2018genetically determined\u2019 even though it has an\nenvironmental factor as one of its causes. Philip Kitcher suggests\nthat some norms of reaction may have this form, but only in some\nlimited, but perhaps contextually important, range of environments\n(Kitcher 2001). For example, a disease caused by the loss of one or\nboth normal copies of a gene might develop in every\nenvironment except those specifically structured as clinical\ninterventions to cure the disease.\n\nAnother norm of reaction is one in which genetic and environmental\nfactors interact \u2018additively\u2019 (Figure 2). Genotype makes a\nconstant difference across some range of environments. While\nthe genetic variable does not determine the actual value of the trait\nin each individual, it does determine the differences between\nindividuals. Moreover, when the norms of reaction have this form,\nheritability scores become relevant to the question of whether and how\nmuch a phenotype can be altered by environmental intervention, as\ndiscussed in the previous section. A famous diagram in the early days\nof behavior genetics depicted the relationship between IQ (P),\ngenotype (G) and the \u2018enrichment\u2019 of the environment (E)\nas having roughly this form (Gottesman 1963a). If correct, this would\nmean that educational enrichment would cause every individual to get a\nhigher test score, but would not change the ordering of their\nscores.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Purely additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nIn perhaps the most famous paper on this topic the geneticist Richard\nLewontin (1974) argued that actual norms of reaction are likely to be\nnon-additive (Figure 3). In that case, it makes no sense to talk of a\nparticular genotype \u2018determining\u2019 a phenotypic difference.\nGenotype and environment jointly determine the outcome in the\nstraightforward sense that the effect of each factor on the outcome is\na function of the particular value taken by the other factor. Whether\nnorms of reaction are typically non-additive and exactly what this\nimplies is the subject of an extensive scientific and philosophical\nliterature on \u2018gene-environment interaction\u2019, as discussed\nin the previous section.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Non-additive interaction\nbetween genotype and environment\n\n\nKitcher (2001) argues that \u2018genetic determinism\u2019 should be\nunderstood as the claim that many norms of reaction have roughly the\n\u2018determinist\u2019 shapes depicted in Figures 1 and 2.\n\nIn recent philosophical literature on innateness, Sober (1998) is\noften credited with the proposal that innateness might be defined as a\nflat norm of reaction (but see Cassidy (1979) for an earlier\nexposition of this idea). According to Sober:\n\n\u2026it is a reasonable hypothesis that the most that can be\nsalvaged from the ancient concept of innateness is this: a\nphenotypic trait is innate for a given genotype if and only if that\nphenotype will emerge in all of a range of developmental\nenvironments. What counts as the appropriate range of\nenvironments is left open in this proposal. Perhaps there is a\nuniquely correct answer to this question; then again, maybe the range\nis determined pragmatically. It is difficult to see how the latter\nconclusion can be evaded. (1998, author\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nSo if the \u2018ancient\u2019 concept of innateness is to be\nsalvaged in this way, the problem of context sensitivity looms large.\nAny given trait is bound to develop in some environmental contexts and\nbe absent in others. Sober\u2019s hope is that this issue can be\nsolved \u201cpragmatically\u201d. This is reminiscent of\nSamuels\u2019 (2002) suggestion that the question of what counts as a\n\u201cnormal\u201d environment should be left to scientists and is\nnot something for philosophers to resolve. Of course, this agnostic\nattitude does not make the problem go away. The fact remains that\nanyone proposing to define innateness in terms of developmental\nstability will have to justify their choice of relevant environments.\nThe fact that scientists can and do manage to perform quantitative\ngenetic analyses does not allay the concern that their choice of which\nenvironmental conditions to consider may be arbitrary or\ninappropriate.\n\nIn his seminal paper \u2018The idea of innateness\u2019 (1975)\nStephen Stich made a similar suggestion, that an innate trait might be\ndefined as one which an organism will manifest in the\n\u201cnormal\u201d course of development. But Stich himself offered\na counterexample to this analysis: universally held beliefs, such as\nthe belief that water quenches thirst, will count as innate on this\nanalysis, which seems counterintuitive (Stich 1975, 9). Andr\u00e9\nAriew has offered another counterexample: humans acquire a typical gut\nflora during development, but these bacteria are intuitively an\nacquired trait rather than an innate trait (Ariew 1999, 133). Ariew\nsuggests that Stich\u2019s analysis confuses evidence for innateness\nwith innateness itself. Universality is evidence for the existence of\na particular kind of developmental mechanism which Ariew explicates in\nterms of Waddington\u2019s concept of environmental canalization\n(Ariew 2007, 10, and see Section 3.4 below).\n\nKhalidi (2002) identifies a further objection to the proposal that\ninnateness can be defined as invariance across some\n\u201cnormal\u201d range of environments. Sometimes, he notes, the\nstrongest evidenced that a trait is innate is its capacity to develop\nin highly abnormal conditions. Consider the deprivation\nexperiments deployed by early ethologists, where animals were raised\nin social isolation or other impoverished circumstances. The tendency\nfor a trait to develop even under these (abnormal) conditions was\nregarded as strong evidence of its innateness. From this perspective\nit seems utterly wrong-headed to define innateness in terms of some\nnormal range, so long as \u201cnormal\u201d is defined as the\nenvironments which a species typically encounters.\n\nCowie (1998) pushes on this idea from another direction. Drawing on\nSocrates\u2019 famous interaction with the slave boy in Plato\u2019s\nMeno, Cowie notes that the boy\u2019s knowledge of geometry is\nregarded as innate simply because it developed in an (arguably)\ninformationally impoverished environment. It makes no difference\nwhether the slave boy\u2019s interaction with Socrates qualifies as a\nnormal environment or not. Hence, environmental invariance is not\nconnected, she argues, to intuitive judgments of innateness (see\nKhalidi 2002 for a discussion of this argument).\n3.3 Innateness as environmental canalization\n\nAndr\u00e9 Ariew (1996; 1999; 2007) has developed a more specific\nversion of the environmental invariance account of innateness.\nFollowing Stich (1975) and Sober (1988), Ariew maintains that the\nprimary job for the concept of innateness \u2013 not just in\npsychology, but in the life sciences generally \u2013 is to explain\nenvironmental invariance. The problem with the norm of reaction\naccount, Ariew objects, is that it merely redescribes this pattern\nrather than explaining the processes that generate it. In an effort to\nexplain invariance, Ariew invokes C. H. Waddington\u2019s idea of\nenvironmental canalization. An environmentally canalized trait is\nbuffered against certain types and amounts of environmental variation\nover stages of its development. Waddington described this phenomenon\nusing the metaphor of an \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d which\nconsists of a ball rolling down a contoured surface (Figure 4). The\nsurface is sloped like a pinball machine. The path traced by a ball as\nit rolls through a particular valley represents the trajectory of a\ndeveloping trait. The amount of \u201cshaking\u201d required to make\nthe ball jump out of one valley and into another depends on the\noverall shape of the landscape. The deeper (more canalized) the\nvalley, the more buffered the trait is against environmental changes\n(or genetic changes, but Ariew focuses on environmental canalization\nrather than its complement, genetic canalization). His proposal is\nsimply that a trait should be considered innate to the extent that it\nis environmentally canalized in Waddington\u2019s sense. One\nadvantage of this definition, he adds, is that it represents\ninnateness as a matter of degree rather than as an all-or-nothing\nproperty.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Waddington\u2019s\ndevelopmental landscape (A). Figure B shows the underside of the\nlandscape with points on the surface anchored to loci in the genome,\nrepresenting the idea that genetic mutations will affect the shape of\nthe landscape. (Waddington 1957, 29 & 36, reproduced with\npermission)\n\n\nNotice that Ariew\u2019s proposal hinges on a particular view of\nWaddington\u2019s metaphor and its cognitive status. Ariew takes this\nmetaphor to provide a mechanistic explanation of developmental\ninvariance. This is the purported benefit of Ariew\u2019s\ncanalization account over the invariance proposal. As he explains,\n\u201cIt is this sense of [environmental] canalization that accounts\nfor the invariance effect that is central to Sober\u2019s account of\nbiological innateness. But better than a mere invariance account, the\neffect is grounded in a real developmental pathway\u201d (Ariew 2007,\n579). Linquist (2018) raises doubts about this claim. When we think\ncarefully about Waddington\u2019s landscape metaphor, he argues, it\nis difficult to see how it could be regarded as an actual causal\nmechanism or even an idealized a model of a mechanism. Instead, most\nmolecular biologists view canalization as a phenomenon to be explained\nrather than as a mechanism that does any explaining. As Greg Gibson\nand G\u00fcnter Wagner note, \u201cThere are likely to be many\nmolecular mechanisms involved [in canalization], including genetic\nredundancy, feedback regulation, and cooperative biochemical\ninteractions\u201d (2000, 373\u201374). They go on to state that\n\u201c[t]hese are more phenomenological descriptions, however, than\nquantitative explanations of buffering.\u201d If these more specific\nproposals are regarded by developmental biologists as \u201cmerely\nphenomenological descriptions\u201d and thus fall short of explaining\ncanalization, where does this leave Waddington\u2019s broader and\nless specific landscape metaphor? Linquist\u2019s (2018) contention\nis that any explanatory insight provided by Waddington\u2019s\nmetaphor is merely apparent. Much like the norm of reaction, this\nmetaphor merely describes the phenomenon of environmental invariance\nwithout explaining it.\n\nAriew (2007) has proposed a second, very different way in which\ncanalization might offer an advantage over the invariance account.\nAriew suggests that the concept of canalization provides a framework\nfor comparing species in their sensitivity to environmental factors.\nFor example, Sober 1998 introduces three different types of learning\nexhibited by different species of songbird. Type 1 songbirds produce\nspecies-typical song even if the bird is reared in silence. Type 2\nbirds produce species-typical song only after sessions of call and\nresponse with a \u201ctutor\u201d from their own species. Type 3\nsongbirds produce their species-typical song after encountering any\nsong at all. These cases are presented by Ariew (2007) as if they vary\nalong a continuum of sensitivity to environmental cues. Type 1\nlearning seems the least sensitive. Type 3 learning is only slightly\nmore sensitive that Type 1, since the trait is \u201ctriggered\u201d\nby exposure to a wide range of songs. Type 2 learning is the most\nsensitive to the specific songs that a bird encounters. Hence,\nAriew\u2019s suggestion is that Type 1 is \u201cmore innate\u201d\nthan Type 3, which is in turn \u201cmore innate\u201d than Type 2.\nBy suggesting that birdsong can be organized along a single axis of\ninnate/triggered/acquired, Ariew seems to be proposing a form of\nexplanatory unification in the sense developed by Kitcher (1989) (see\nthe entry on\n Scientific Explanation).\n An important feature of explanatory unification is the capacity to\nshow how disparate phenomena, previously thought to be unrelated, can\nbe derived using a single, limited vocabulary for describing them. We\ncan apply this to Ariew\u2019s birdsong example. Upon first\nencountering the three types of learning (Types 1, 2, and 3), one\nmight assume that they are entirely distinct phenomena. However, to\nfurther discover that they vary along a single parameter \u2013 i.e.,\nthe \u201cinnateness/triggering/acquired\u201d dimension \u2013\nwould seem to unify them, in Kitcher\u2019s sense.\n\nIn response to Ariew\u2019s proposal, however, Griffiths and Machery\n(2008) argue that canalization is actually a multi-dimensional\nphenomenon. There is no such thing as \u201cthe\u201d degree to\nwhich a trait is buffered against \u201cthe\u201d environment.\nRather, for each trait there are many different environmental factors\ncapable of influencing its development, each to varying degrees.\nAriew\u2019s example with the songbirds seems to work only because it\nis oversimplified. With examples of real birds it proves unworkable.\nFor example, the songs of the much-studied Brown-headed Cowbird are\nrelatively insensitive to the songs of other male cowbirds. This is in\ncontrast to the equally well-studied Song Sparrow, whose songs are\nhighly sensitive to conspecific male songs. So, when we focus on just\nthis factor \u2013 male conspecific song \u2013 the cowbirds seem\nrelatively canalized or \u201cinnate\u201d compared to the sparrows.\nHowever, other researchers focus on the ways that courtship\ninteractions (with females) influence song development. When it comes\nto this environmental factor, the song of male cowbirds is much more\nsensitive (less canalized) than most sparrows. Hence, song development\nwill appear more or less canalized or \u201cinnate\u201d in these\ntaxa depending on which environmental factor we focus. Hence,\nGriffiths and Machery conclude:\n\nThe strategy of placing traits along a continuum of independence of\nthe environment founders on the fact that there is no continuum, but\nrather a high-dimensional space whose axes are often specific to one\nor a few species. Even when the same axes can be applied to different\nspecies, so that canalization of a character in two species can be\nmeaningfully compared, there is no systematic tendency for traits that\nare at the \u201cinnate\u201d end of one axis to be at the\n\u201cinnate\u201d end of the other. (2008, 402)\n\n\nThis situation threatens Ariew\u2019s suggestion that canalization\nmight serve as a unifying concept in biology and psychology. In order\nto effectively unify disparate phenomena, such as the development of\nsong in different species of birds, a concept must provide some\nrelatively simple organizing framework. Ariew painted a simplistic\npicture of birdsong, giving the impression that different species\ncould be arranged along a single environmental axis. Griffiths and\nMachery object that there are indefinitely many environmental axes\nalong which a group of species might be compared. Moreover, the\narrangement of species as more or less canalized will vary from one\nenvironmental axis to the next. Such complexity and lack of coherence\nmakes canalization a bad candidate for conceptual unification.\n\nGriffiths and Machery (2008) mention another consideration that makes\nthe prospects for conceptual unification seem even less promising.\nThey note that the kinds of environmental factors that influence trait\ndevelopment are often highly surprising. For instance, there is a link\nbetween maternal licking of male rat pups and their ability to perform\nsexually as adults (Moore 1992). From these examples, one gets the\nimpression that cryptic environmental influences abound and that the\nonly obstacle to their discovery is researchers\u2019 ability to\nanticipate them. However, if researchers are often unaware of which\nenvironmental factors influence a trait, they then are unlikely to\ntest for those factors experimentally. This means that traits will be\ndeemed \u201cinnate\u201d or environmentally canalized, not because\nthey are buffered against many environmental factors, but rather\nbecause researchers have not thought to look at the factors to which\nthey are sensitive.\n\nOne way to potentially render scientific statements more accurate is\nby demanding that any innateness claim is explicit about the precise\nenvironmental contexts being taken into account. Elizabeth\nO\u2019Neil (2014) proposes this as a strategy for revising the\nscientific concept of innateness. She proposes that scientists\nstudying innateness should always explicitly identify the\nenvironmental contexts in which a given trait is (or is not)\ndevelopmentally invariant. O\u2019Neill argues that such a shift in\nscientific discourse would reduce the amount of confusion produced by\ninnateness claims. However, even if this new scientific convention\ncould be established, what further benefit would there be in adding\nthe term \u2018innate\u2019 after specifying the actual dimensions\nand degrees of environmental canalization? Scientists could simply\nfollow Bateson\u2019s call to: \u201cSay what you mean (even if it\nuses a bit more space) rather than unintentionally confuse your\nreaders by employing a word such as innate that carries so many\ndifferent connotations\u201d (Bateson 1991, 22).\n3.4 Other revisionary proposals\n\nWe have described three revisionary proposals in detail because they\nreflect major themes in the century long controversy about the innate\nacquired distinction. But there are many other proposals to redefine\ninnateness in the philosophical literature.\n\nRon Mallon and Jonathan Weinberg (2006, 2008) argue that an innate\nphenotype is \u201cproperly understood\u201d (2008, 415) as one that\nis invariant in normal environments (Section 3.2), but also produced\nby a \u2018closed developmental process.\u2019 Mallon and\nWeinberg\u2019s distinction between \u2018open\u2019 and\n\u2018closed\u2019 processes appears to be the same as that that\ndrawn by Ernst Mayr (1961) between open and closed genetic programs.\nAn open developmental process can respond to different environments by\nproducing a range of different phenotypes, while a closed\ndevelopmental process can only produce one or a small number of\noutcomes and changing the environment either has no effect or simply\nterminates the process, perhaps killing or severely impairing the\norganism.\n\nGualtiero Piccinini and Robert Northcott propose that \u201ctraits\nare innate to the degree that they are caused by factors intrinsic to\nthe organism at the time of its origin\u201d (2018, 1). This is the\ncorrect definition of innateness and judgments that disagree with it\nshould be revised, although they suggest that only those\n\u201cuntutored\u201d in biology will make such divergent judgments\n(2018, 1). Their proposal relies on three key ideas, intrinsic\nfactors, the organism\u2019s moment of origin, and degree of causal\nexplanation. The idea of intrinsic factors is meant as a superior\nalternative to the idea that innate phenotypes depend on genes or on\ninherited factors. Those two ideas are replaced by the idea of\n\u201cproperties that organisms have in virtue of what\u2019s within\ntheir boundaries\u201d (2018, 2).\u00a0 Some of these intrinsic\nfactors are present at the moment when an organism becomes a new\nindividual (which they note may not be well-defined for all\norganisms). The degree to which these factors explain a phenotype is\nto be measured using Northcott\u2019s (2013) theory of degrees of\ncausal explanation.\n\nNathan Cofnas (2017) has attempted to revive Lorenz\u2019s 1965\ntheory\u00a0 (See Section 1.4). Lorenz was basically correct that\ninnate phenotypes are those which are adaptive because of information\ncontained in the genome, although the details of Lorenz\u2019s theory\nneed revision in light of recent work on epigenetic and cultural\nevolution. Cofnas\u2019s main addition to Lorenz is to propose that\ngenes contain adaptive information in the\n \u2018teleosemantic\u2019\n sense that they have evolved by natural selection to create a\nparticular adaptive match between phenotype and environment.\n\nMuhammad Ali Khalidi (2002; 2007; 2016) has developed an account of\ninnateness that builds on the older idea of \u2018poverty of the\nstimulus\u2019 (Section 1.5). He restricts his account to\npsychological traits, where the problems of assessing the relative\nweight of genetic and environmental causes can be avoided, \u201cby\nfocusing on the informational content of the stimulus relative to the\nresultant cognitive capacity\u201d (2002, 263). In Khalidi\u2019s\nview, it is possible to judge the informational complexity of certain\nrepresentational states, such as a belief or cognitive skill. It is\nalso possible, according to Khalidi, to assess the amount of\nenvironmental information available to the organism during\ndevelopment. The discrepancy between the amount of available\ninformation and the complexity of the belief or skill determines its\ndegree of innateness. A complex belief that develops in an\ninformationally impoverished environment is highly innate on this\nview. Such beliefs are sometimes described as being\n\u201ctriggered\u201d by the environment, as opposed to being\nlearned (Fodor 1981). Hence, Khalidi dubs this the\n\u2018triggering\u2019 account of innateness: \u201cAn innate\ncognitive capacity is one that has a disposition or tendency to be\ntriggered on the basis of an environmental input that is impoverished\nby comparison to the resultant cognitive capacity\u201d (Khalidi\n2009, 506). Because of its limited range of application this is not\nintended as a general\u00a0 definition of innateness. Rather, the\ntriggering account is intended as an explication of how cognitive\nscientists currently use the term.\n\nIt should be clear that the success of this account depends on our\nability to make sense of this notion of informational relevance.\nKhalidi admits that a quantitative measure is difficult, but argues\nthat there are robust non-quantitative ways to document the\ninformational poverty of the environment relative to the phenotype\n(Khalidi 2007).\n\nA consistent theme in recent revisionist proposals is the\nauthors\u2019 conviction that they have correctly diagnosed how\nworking scientists understand innateness. Cofnas, for example,\nsuggests that it is primarily philosophers who have criticised the\nidea of innateness and that amongst real scientists only \u201ca few\nphilosophically minded ones\u201d have any reservations about the\nconcept. To nearly all scientists it is \u201ca valid, useful concept\nwith an obvious one-sentence definition.\u201d (2017, 560) But as we\nhave described in Section 1, the innate/acquired distinction has been\nscientifically controversial ever since Darwin.\n\nThere is little cross-citation amongst these recent proposals to\nredefine innateness, raising two important issues for future research.\nFirst, are all these analyses extensionally equivalent, classifying\ntraits as innate or acquired to similar degree? In particular, do they\nagree on cases where there has been actual scientific disagreement\nabout whether the trait is innate, and cases which critics have used\nto agree that the distinction is not helpful? Second, and relatedly,\nalthough Khalidi is the only proposal explicitly restricted to one\nscientific field, do other analyses implicitly focus on how innateness\nis understood in some fields and neglect others?\n3.5 Eliminativism about the innate/acquired distinction\n\nThe previous subsections described attempts to revise the scientific\nconcept of innateness in order to avoid the semantic confusion that\nhas obscured the real issues in nearly a century and a half of\ncontroversy about the innate/acquired distinction. To briefly recap,\nthere are three general problems that critics associate with this\nconcept. One problem is that the concept is deeply muddled. Mameli and\nBateson (2006) identified as many as 26 distinct\n\u2018i-properties\u2019 associated with innateness. This alone is a\nsource of confusion, potentially leading scientists to misunderstand\none another, especially when it comes to communication across\ndifferent disciplines. A related worry is that researchers will be\ninclined to draw fallacious inferences, where evidence for the\npresence of one i-property is taken as sufficient grounds for\ninferring the existence of other i-properties. The fact that\npsychologists since C.L. Morgan (1896) have warned against this\ntendency (see also Dunlap 1919; Bernard 1924; Lehrman 1953; Bateson\n1991) indicates that it is a genuine concern among practitioners, and\nnot merely hypothetical (see Section 2). A second recurring complaint\nis that innateness claims draw scientific attention away from the\nmultifarious and often subtle ways in which environmental factors\ncontribute to development. Again, this objection has a long history\nthat extends back to A.R. Wallace (1892) and has been raised on\nnumerous occasions by psychologists (e.g. Kuo 1921; Lehrman 1970),\nbiologists (e.g. Hinde 1968; Bateson 1991) and philosophers (e.g.\nCowie 1998; Griffiths 2002). A third objection is that the scientific\nconcept of innateness is psychologically anchored in an essentialist\nfolk biology that is scientifically untenable.\n\nInstead of asking scientists to agree to use a revised conception of\ninnateness, which would then have to be consistently distinguished\nfrom the vernacular conception, a simpler and potentially more\neffective strategy is to eliminate the innate/acquired distinction\nfrom scientific discourse. This recommendation has been advocated by a\nnumber of philosophers and some scientists (Mameli and Bateson 2006;\nBateson and Mameli 2007; Griffiths 2002; Griffiths, et al. 2009;\nGriffiths and Machery 2008; Linquist et al. 2011; Linquist 2018;\nMachery 2017; Machery et al. 2019). This does not mean forbidding the\nuse of the word \u2018innate\u2019, even if such a thing were\npossible or ethical. It merely means reducing its status to that of\nphrases like \u2018in the blood\u2019 which are no longer seen as\nthe names of serious scientific constructs worthy of detailed\ninvestigation.\n\nCowie (2009) offers a helpful distinction between three types of\neliminativist argument. The first, argues that some type of object or\nproperty fails to exist. She claims that this type of argument cannot\nbe applied to the concept of innateness because the concept is too\nunclear to even specify what it refers to. A second style of argument\nclaims that a concept should be eliminated because \u201cit\ndoesn\u2019t work.\u201d That is, because it is associated with a\nfailing or degenerate research program. Cowie argues that the concept\nof innateness has in fact been highly productive. This is a question\nwe return to momentarily. The third style of argument claims that the\ntarget concept is so muddled that it should be eliminated for this\nreason alone. Cowie (2009) suggests that vagueness and ambiguity can\npotentially lead to fruitful research programs. Philosophers should be\ncautious about demanding conceptual clarity from scientists when\nunclear concepts are leading to productive outcomes.\n\nIn support of the suggestion that the concept of innateness has been\nscientifically productive, Cowie relies on examples from cognitive\nscience such as that of Chomsky and his followers on language\nacquisition. Although one cannot deny that this concept has been\nproductive, it is a further question whether certain sciences would\nhave advanced more rapidly if they had not framed their hypotheses in\nterms of the innate/acquired distinction. Another lesson to be drawn\nfrom the history of psychology is that the sheer volume of research\npapers on a subject is not always a good indication of a healthy\ndiscipline. The study of instinct was a productive cottage industry at\nthe beginning of the 20th century (see Section 1.2). Little of this\nwork is cited today, except as an historical example of a failed\nresearch program. More recently, the discipline of Evolutionary\nPsychology has revived a similar approach to nativism as the early\ninstinct theorists (Hampton 2004). It is controversial whether this\nprogram qualifies as an advance in our understanding of the human mind\n(Buller 2006; Laland and Brown 2002). Ultimately, it is an empirical\nquestion whether adherence to an innate/acquired distinction is\nconducive to scientific progress. It is notoriously difficult to say\nwhether a given research program is on the whole more or less\nproductive than some rival (Laudan 1977). Yet this is an area where,\nwe think, careful historical and philosophical analysis would pay\nvaluable dividends.\n4. Conclusion\n\nThe innate/acquired distinction is not only interesting in its own\nright, but also serves as an example of how the discipline of\nphilosophy can and should interact with the scientific fields it\ninvestigates. In this entry we have explored some of the historical\ndebates over nativism as they have played out within the disciplines\nof psychology and biology. Philosophical diagnoses of these debates\ntend to focus on particular historical episodes or on the work of\nindividual historical figures (e.g. Konrad Lorenz and his debate with\nLehrman). This raises an important consideration when evaluating the\ngenerality of a given philosophical diagnosis: to what extent is it\nshaped by the particular details of the scientific debate on which it\nis based? Our view is that an adequate philosophical diagnosis of what\nis at issue in scientific debates over nativism should sample from a\nbroad range of historical periods and figures.\n\nAs we have seen, the word \u201cinnate\u201d is used as a technical\nterm in scientific biology and psychology. It also has a long history\nof usage in the vernacular. This dual existence gives rise to two\ndistinct sets of issues when philosophically analyzing the concept. In\nscientific contexts, the core issue is whether some prevailing concept\nof innateness adequately serves the epistemic goals of the fields in\nwhich it is employed. It is important to note that epistemic goals can\nvary across disciplines, among research programs within a discipline,\nand potentially over time. This raises a methodological challenge for\nphilosophers attempting to evaluate a candidate scientific definition\nof innateness. To do the job well, the philosopher must assume the\nrole of an anthropologist (Dennett 1986) paying careful attention to\nthe specific ways that scientists are using the term. Some\nphilosophers have employed the tools of experimental philosophy to aid\nin this task. (Griffiths, et al. 2009; Linquist et al. 2011; Knobe and\nSamuels 2013; Machery et al. 2019)\n\nAn analysis of the vernacular concept raises a distinct set of issues.\nThe innate/acquired distinction features in socially and ethically\nimportant discussions, for example in disputes about whether human\nsexual diversity is \u2018innate\u2019. Experimental work (Section\n3.5) strongly suggests that the vernacular concept of innateness\nprojects a scientifically discredited essentialism about species onto\nnature. This does not seem a sound basis on which to discuss such\nissues (Lewens 2020). Arguably, one reason that people continue to\nhave confidence in the distinction is that they believe there are\nscientific experts who are capable of definitively classifying traits\nas innate or acquired. But as we have shown in this entry, such\nclassifications are in reality highly problematic and there is little\nagreement either about whether they have scientific value or about how\nthey should be drawn.\n",
