    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Bradley-Russell Debate About Relations and Complexes in 1910/1911\n1.3 The Bradley-Russell Debate About Relations and Complexes in 1910/1911\n\nBradley\u2019s arguments against relations gained a different\ndimension during his debate with Russell in the journal Mind,\nduring 1910\u20131911. At this point, Bradley is no longer concerned\njust with arguments against the relational unity of qualities; rather,\nhe is concerned with the possibility of there being compex unities\nthat cannot be analyzed.\n\nBy the end of his paper \u201cOn Appearance, Error, and\nContradiction\u201d (1910), Bradley challenges Russell to explain how\nhe can reconcile his pluralism of terms and external relations with\nhis commitment to complex unanalyzable entities which have terms and\nexternal relations as constituents. He writes as follows:\n\nI encounter at the outset a great difficulty. Mr. Russell\u2019s\nposition has remained to myself incomprehensible. On the one side I am\nled to think that he defends a strict pluralism, for which nothing is\nadmissible beyond simple terms and external relations. On the other\nside Mr. Russell seems to assert emphatically, and to use throughout,\nideas which such a pluralism surely must repudiate. He throughout\nstands upon unities which are complex and which cannot be analysed\ninto terms and relations. These two positions to my mind are\nirreconcilable, since the second, as I understand it, contradicts the\nfirst flatly. If there are such unities, and still more, if such\nunities are fundamental, then pluralism surely is in principle\nabandoned as false. (Bradley 1910: 179)\n\nBradley thinks that a pluralist who postulates two fundamental simple\nentities cannot also admit a third fundamental entity which\nis complex, i.e., constituted out of the simple entities. There is a\ntension which must be resolved by either letting go of the\nfundamentality of the simples (the view that Bradley would have opted\nfor); or by letting go of the fundamentality of complexes (the view\nthat Bradley thinks a consistent pluralist should embrace). But there\nis a further way that the tension might be resolved, and this is by\narguing that simples and complexes are fundamental in different senses\nof the term \u201cfundamental\u201d. (For different senses of\nfundamentality in this context see Perovic (2016) who distinguishes\nbetween constitutive, explanatory, and existential\nfundamentality.)\n\nRussell\u2019s own reply to Bradley focused on clarifying the sense\nin which he claimed that complex unities cannot be analyzed. He wrote\nback the following:\n\nIt would seem that everything here turns upon the sense in which such\nunities cannot be analysed. I do not admit that, in any strict sense,\nunities are incapable of analysis; on the contrary, I hold that they\nare the only objects that can be analysed. What I admit is that no\nenumeration of their constituents will reconstitute them,\nsince any such enumeration gives us a plurality, not a unity. But I do\nnot admit that they are not composed of their constituents; and what\nis more to the purpose, I do not admit that their constituents cannot\nbe considered truly unless we remember that they are their\nconstituents. (Russell 1910: 373)\n\nIn this reply to Bradley, Russell is taking care to point out that he\nis using the term \u201canalysis\u201d to designate a process\nperformed by us of \u201cdiscovery of the constituents of\nthe complex\u201d (Russell 1910: 374). This signifies a departure\nfrom his claims in the Principles of Mathematics, where he\nargued that propositional unities could not be analyzed because\nanalysis would destroy the unity of the proposition (Russell 1903:\n50\u201351). This shift in the understanding of the notion of\n\u201canalysis\u201d from ontological breaking down of unities to\nsomething that we perform when we are discovering\nconstituents of complex entities, allows Russell to say that complexes\nare the only objects that can in fact be analyzed.\n\nIn addition, Russell pinpoints his disagreement with Bradley when it\ncomes to relations. Russell explicitly rejects the view which favors\ninternal relations, that is, which holds \u201cthat the fact\nthat an object x has a certain relation R to an object y implies\ncomplexity in x and y, i.e., it implies something in the\n\u201cnatures\u201d of x and y in virtue of which they are related\nby the relation R\u201d (Russell 1910: 373\u2013374). Instead,\nRussell states his support of external relations, the holding\nof which cannot be derived from the terms that such relations relate\nor their intrinsic complexity. Instead, when we have x and y standing\nin an external relation R, we then have a complex or a unity\nxRy. What distinguishes such a complex from a \u201cmere\naggregate\u201d, according to Russell, is that a relation in a\nunified complex relates whereas in an aggregate it does not\nrelate and is just a member of an aggregate.\n\nRussell\u2019s reply was unsatisfying to Bradley, who followed up\nwith his \u201cReply to Mr Russell\u2019s Explanations\u201d in\n1911, reiterating some of the same concerns. Namely, Bradley\nrepeatedly returns to the worry about external relations\u2014he\nfinds them to be unobservable and unthinkable without the terms; a\nrelation apart from its terms is indeed for Bradley an\n\u201cindefensible abstraction\u201d. In addition, he asks Russell\nto elaborate further on the presumed difference between an aggregate\nof entities and a unity of those entities. Bradley says that an appeal\nto relating relations is unsatisfying and further asks Russell to\nexplain wherein the difference between relating relations and\nnon-relating relations lies for him. But for Russell there was no\nfurther story to be told; the difference between relating and\nnon-relating relations is a primitive on which he did not feel the\nneed to offer any further details. \n",
