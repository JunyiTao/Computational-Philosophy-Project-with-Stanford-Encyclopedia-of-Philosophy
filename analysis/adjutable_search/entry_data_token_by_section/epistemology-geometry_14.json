    "main_text": "The intelligibility of the new geometries || Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9\n6.2 Helmholtz and Poincar\u00e9\n\nRiemann\u2019s ideas in turn influenced Hermann von Helmholtz, who\npublished several influential essays on how our knowledge of geometry\nis possible. In his \u201cOn the factual [thats\u00e4chlichen]\nfoundations of geometry\u201d (1866) he endeavoured to show how\nonly a limited number of Riemannian geometries can be constructed in\nwhich there is a concept of rigid body motion. He argued that it is\nour experience of rigid bodies that teaches us what space is like, and\nin particular what distance is. He further claimed that a\n2-dimensional space that admits rigid body motions would either be the\nEuclidean plane or the sphere. Beltrami wrote to him to point out that\nhe had overlooked the possibility of non-Euclidean geometry, and\nHelmholtz not only agreed, but wrote a further essay (1868) in which\nhe explained how it would be possible for us to have knowledge of this\ngeometry at an intuitive level (thus giving the lie to followers of\nKant). Many Kantians refused to be convinced, but one person that\nthese ideas (and Riemann's) very likely influenced was Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 (see Gray 2012).\n\nAs soon as Poincar\u00e9 began to write his popular philosophical\nessays about geometry, he made it clear that his chief concern was\nwith how we could rely on any geometry at all. Mathematical advances\nwere the basis for his reflections, but the key question was about the\nepistemological status of the hypotheses on which geometry is founded.\nAnd here he could not agree with Kant, nor Helmholtz, nor with\nRiemann. He was well aware of the great range of Riemannian\ngeometries, and of the conclusion of Helmholtz\u2019s speculations,\nby then made rigorous in the work of Sophus Lie, that a very limited\nnumber of geometries admitted rigid body motions. His concern in his\n\u201cOn the foundations of geometry\u201d (1898) was with\nepistemology.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argued that the mind quickly realises that it can\ncompensate for certain kinds of motions that it sees. If a glass comes\ntowards you, you can walk backwards in such a way that the glass seems\nunaltered. You can do the same if it tilts or rotates. We come to\nmaster a store of these compensating motions, and we realise that we\ncan follow one with another and the result will be a third\ncompensating motion. On this basis we come to distinguish\ndisplacements (both our bodily displacements and displacements of\nobjects) from other kinds of change, i.e., alterations for which we\ncannot generate compensating motions, such as the motion of the wine\nin the glass as it swirls around, or a change in its colour. Most\nimportantly, the displacements form a mathematical structure called a\ngroup. In this way the mind comes to form the concept of a rigid body\nmotion, and we elaborate a clear conceptual understanding of space on\nthe basis of the group of motions.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 then considered what group the group of compensating\nmotions could be, and found that, as Lie had proved in his study of\nthe Riemann-Helmholtz problem of space, there was a strictly limited\ncollection of such groups. Chief among them were the groups that come\nfrom Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry, and as abstract groups they\nare different. But which one was correct?\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s controversial view was that one could never\nknow, or better, than none was simply \"true\". Human beings, through\nevolution and through our experience as infants, pick the Euclidean\ngroup and so we say that space is Euclidean. Our bodies are quite\nrigid, our motions are rigid motions, and this is decisive. Another\nspecies, drawing on different experiences, could pick the\nnon-Euclidean group and so say that space was non-Euclidean. If we met\nsuch a species, there would be no experiment that would decide the\nissue.\n\nOf course, one can make experiments using large triangles and\nmeasuring the angles, as Lobachevskii, Riemann and others had\nsuggested. To maximize dimensions, assume that the sides of the\ntriangle are made by rays of light. Now, suppose that within the\nlimits of experimental error the result of the experiment is that the\nangle sum of the triangle is less that \\(\\pi\\), a result consistent\nwith non-Euclidean geometry but inconsistent with Euclidean geometry.\nThe only conclusion one can draw, said Poincar\u00e9, is that either\nlight rays travel along straight lines and space is non-Euclidean, or\nthat space is Euclidean and light rays travel along curves.\n\nWe can summarise his argument this way. Our knowledge of the geometry\nof the external world is founded on our basic physical experiences,\nwhich lead to our mental ability to deal with a group of rigid body\nmotions. There is a very limited store of these groups, but no\nexperiment can decide between them. All we can do is make a choice,\nand we shall choose the simplest one. As it happens, that was the\nEuclidean group, because, said Poincar\u00e9, we had found that one\nof its properties not shared with the non-Euclidean group\n(corresponding to the parallel postulate), was particularly simple.\nBut the human species had, as it were, made a choice, and that choice\nwas now innate in the human mind. Because of the way knowledge is\nacquired and the fact that there is more than one appropriate group,\none can never know whether space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean, only\nthat we construct it as Euclidean.\n\nThis twist on the Kantian doctrine of the unknowability of the\nDing an sich (the thing in itself) and our confinement to the\nworld of appearances, was congenial to Poincar\u00e9 as a working\nphysicist. Even though he agreed with Riemann to a large extent,\nRiemann had hoped that empirical matters would guide the choice of\ngeometry, while Poincar\u00e9 could not agree. The viewpoint just\nexplained is Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophy of geometrical\nconventionalism. But there is an important distinction to make. Notice\nthat this is not like the conventionality of words, but rather like\nsocial or legal conventions (where some basic facts have to be taken\ninto account, see De Paz 2018). The situation is far from total\narbitrariness, since physical experience plays a decisive role and\nrestricts the choice; but there is no absolute determination either,\nin the end a choice has to be made, and simplicity has the final\nword.\n\nHe advocated conventionalism in other areas of science too, arguing\nthat what we call the laws of nature (Newton\u2019s laws, e.g., the\nprinciple of inertia) are neither empirical matters open to revision\nnor absolute truths but are well established results that have been\nelevated to the role of axioms in present scientific theories. They\ncould be challenged, but only if a whole scientific theory was being\nchallenged, not idly when some awkward observations were made. Faced\nwith a satellite that did not seem to be obeying Newton\u2019s laws\none should, said Poincar\u00e9, consider some as-yet unnoticed force\nat work and not seek to re-write Newton. But a new theory can be\nproposed, based on different assumptions that rewrite a law of nature,\nbecause these laws are not eternal truths\u2014we could never know\nsuch things. And if a new law were to be proposed, simplicity and not\nonly empirical fit will be taken into account as one chooses between\nthe new and the old.\n\nThe crucial distinction here is that scientific conventionalism\noperates at a high level. The choices are made consciously and\nintellectually, the debate is only open to people with a considerable\namount of specialised education. On the other hand, the choice of\nEuclidean geometry operates in the mind before it is capable of any\nkind of formal instruction; without some geometric framework,\nthe unfortunate subject would be incapable of any knowledge of the\nexternal world.\n",
