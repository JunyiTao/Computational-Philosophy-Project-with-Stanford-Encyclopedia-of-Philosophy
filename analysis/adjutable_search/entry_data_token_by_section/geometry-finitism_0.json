    "main_text": "Some general considerations\n1. Some general considerations\n\nThe most important thing to take into account is, given a particular\nproposal for a discrete geometry, what the scientific and/or\nphilosophical background is of the author(s) and, related to that,\nwhat their intentions are. Are they logicians, mathematicians,\ncomputer scientists, physicists or philosophers (to list the five most\nfrequently occurring cases)? Do they want to solve a mere technical, a\nphysical or a philosophical problem? Are they worried about\nfoundational aspects or is the object of their research to further\ndevelop existing theories? It is worthwhile to go into some more\ndetail for each of the five types of author(s) mentioned to illustrate\nthese questions.\n",
