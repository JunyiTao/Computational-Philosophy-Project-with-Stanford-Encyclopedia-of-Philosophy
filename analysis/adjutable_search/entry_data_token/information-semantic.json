It is perhaps the richest of them\nall. It is by now almost post-truistic that interested parties, from\nindividuals, to large-scale globalised private actors and nation\nstates, will go to extraordinary lengths to protect and to acquire\ninformation. If we allow ourselves to engage in a little armchair\netymology, then something\u2019s being in formation is just\nfor it to to be non-random. Indeed this armchair etymology gets\nstraight to the heart of how it is that we often speak of information,\nas a contrast to randomisation. Indeed \u201csignal-to-noise\nratio\u201d may be restated as \u201cinformation-to-noise\nratio\u201d, hence the ubiquity of the refrain \u201cThat is not\ninformation, it is just noise\u201d.\n\nAnother way of putting this is to say that information is a non-random\ndistinction with a difference. Information supervenes on patterned\ndeviations, and getting information from one\u2019s environment\ndepends on one being able to recognise and exploit these patterns.\nThat one part of our environment may carry information about another\npart of our environment depends on our environment behaving in\nreliable, non-randomised way. Our ability to use information at one\npart of our environment to access information at another part of it\ndepends not only on our ability to recognise patterned regularities,\nbut on our ability to recognise connections between such\nregularities.\n\nFor example, for us to access the distal information that there is\nfire from the proximal information that there is smoke, we must be\naware of the correlation between smoke and fire. That we do is marked\nby maxims such as \u201dsmoke means fire\u201d. Such correlations of\nnatural meaning between events in the world is studied by the\nMathematical Theory of Communication (MTC) due to Shannon and Weaver\n(see the entry on\n information).\n This is the \u201cindustry standard\u201d account of information,\nas analysed by communications engineers. What of the information\nencoded by natural language however? What of information in this more\nconcretely semantic sense? A semantic conception of information will\nnot investigate the mere surprise value of a signal given the\nlikelihood of the signal itself (as does MTC). Instead, it will\ninvestigate the nature of the information carried by, or encoded by\nthe messages transmitted themselves. Another way of approaching the\nissue is to understand such semantic conceptions of information to be\nconcerned with the investigation of the informational content\nof a piece of language of some sort. Such pieces of language\nmight be propositions, singular terms, descriptions, and so on.\n\nThe first theory of such a semantic conception of information that was\narticulated in detail was Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information. It is fitting then that we start here in\n section 1.\n In\n section 1.1\n we will see how the theory of semantic information has some\nconsequences for certain types of statements, namely logical truths\nand contradictions, that many have found counterintuitive. In\n section 1.2\n we will see how Floridi responds to these problems, as well how\nothers have extended and responded to Floridi\u2019s proposal that we\naccept the veridicality thesis\u2014that information be\nfactive. A number of such responses are motivated by realist and\nnaturalist considerations with regard to the ontology of semantic\ninformation. In\n section 2\n we will look at semantic conceptions of information that take\nnaturalist metaphysics seriously. Here we will see how Fodor, Dretske,\nEvans, Lewis, Recanati, and Jackson propose and defend semantic\nconceptions of information that turn on modes of presentation, and\nthat are broadly naturalist insofar as they attempt to subsume\ninformation within causal relations of various sorts. Any causal\ntheory of meaning or knowledge will face the problem of accounting for\nthe meaning of, and our epistemic access to, abstract objects.\n\nMost of the theories of broadly semantic information outlined in\n section 2\n appeal to information channels in one sense or another (with a\nchannel being a relation allowing information the flow from one state\nto another). In\n section 3\n we will look at theories of information channels directly. (For a\ndetailed examination of the formal properties of the theory of\ninformation channels, as well as how it is that the theory connects\nwith other issues in logic and information more generally, see the\nentry on\n logic and information.)\n We will see how the original theory of information channels due to\nBarwise and Perry emerged from Austin\u2019s theory of semantic\ncontent, as well as how it is that the theory of information channels\nhas been developed and extended in order to give a semantics for\ninformation flow itself, as well as informational semantics for\nnatural language fragments and epistemic phenomena.\n", "toc": [{"#BarHillCarnTheoSemaInfo": "1.

Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s Theory of Semantic Information\n\nThe most natural starting point for any overview of semantic\nconceptions of information is Carnap and Bar-Hillel\u2019s \u201cAn\nOutline of a Theory of Semantic Information\u201d (1952). Bar Hillel\nand Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic information is a quantitative\ntheory that emerged from more general theories of information (see \nsection 4.2 on Shannon in the entry on\n information).\n Their theory was designed with the goal of giving us a usable\nframework for calculating the amount of semantic information\nencoded by a sentence in a particular language. In their case the\nlanguage in question is monadic predicate logic. The philosophical\ndetails are grounded on an idea that has come to be known as the\ninverse range principle (IRP). Loosely, IRP states that the\namount of information carried or encoded by a sentence is inversely\nproportional to something else, where this something else is something\nto which one can attach a precise numerical value. Once this has been\ndone, one can use this numerical value to calculate the measure of\nsemantic information as understood by the theory of semantic\ninformation.\n\nFor Bar-Hillel and Carnap, the amount of semantic information\nencoded by a sentence is inversely proportional to the likelihood of\nthe truth of that sentence. So for them, the likelihood of truth\nis the \u201csomething else\u201d to which we can attach a precise\nnumerical value. To illustrate, we start with their method of\ncalculating a qualitative individuation of semantic information,\ncontent or \u201cCont\u201d.\n\nWhere \\(s\\) is a sentence and \\(W\\) is\nthe set of all possible worlds, content is defined as follows:\n\\[\\tCont(s) := \\{x\\in W : x\\vdash \\neg s\\}\\]\n\nGiven that the intension of a sentence \\(s\\)\nis the set of all worlds in which the sentence if true, and\nthat the content of a sentence is the set of all worlds in which \\(s\\)\nis false, the intension and the content of a\nsentence \\(s\\) form a partition on the set of all\nworlds \\(W\\).\n\nBar-Hillel and Carnap define two distinct methods for\nquantitative calculations of semantic information\u2014a\ncontent measure (cont), and an information measure\n(inf). They start with an a priori probability measure of a\nsentence \\(s\\), \\(p(s)\\), which is gotten from an a\npriori distribution. The a priori distribution onto \\(W\\)\nsums to 1, and we assume that all assignments are\nequiprobable, hence the a priori probability measure is the\nvalue of \\(p(s)\\) that results from this distribution. In this case,\ncont and inf can be defined as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tcont(s) &:= 1 - p(s)\\\\ \\inf(s) &:= \\log_2\\frac{1}{1 - \\tcont(s)} \\end{align}\\]\n\nThe two measures are required for technical reasons\u2014in order to\ncapture additivity on content independence and inductive\nindependence respectively. Two sentences \\(s\\) and\n\\(s'\\) are content independent when they do not have any worlds in\ncommon. Two sentences \\(s\\) and \\(s'\\) are inductively\nindependent when the conditional probability of each sentence given\nthe other is identical to their initial unconditional probability.\nAdditivity on inductive independence fails for cont, since it might be\nthe case that \\(\\tcont(s\\wedge s') \\neq \\tcont(s) + \\tcont(s')\\) on\naccount of \\(p(s)\\) and \\(p(s')\\) having worlds in common\u2014that\nis, on account of them not being content independent in spite of their\nbeing inductively independent. For additivity to hold on cont, it is\ncontent independence, as opposed to inductive independence\nthat is required. By contrast, additivity on inductive independence\ndoes not fail for inf. Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s proof is\nnon-trivial (found on their 1952: 244\u20135).\n1.1 Problems for the theory of semantic information\n\nTechnical matters aside, some philosophical issues are immediate.\nFirstly, how do we know in practice how many possible words there are?\nIf we are talking about the number of possible worlds with respect to\nall possible sentences in English, then there will be infinitely many\nof them. Bar-Hillel and Carnap avoided this issue by talking\nexclusively about the semantic information encoded by sentences\nformulated in monadic predicate logic with a finite number of\npredicate letters. Where there are \\(n\\) predicate\nletters, there will be \\(2^n\\) possible objects, exhausting all\npossible predicate combinations. There will then be \\(2^{2^n}\\)\npossible worlds (\u201cstate descriptions\u201d in Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s parlance), corresponding to all possible combinations\nof possible objects. Hintikka (1970, 1973), extended Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s theory of semantic information from monadic predicate\nlogic to fully general predicate logic.\n\nThirdly and more generally, Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information has give rise to two problems of strong\nsignificance philosophically.\n\nThe Bar-Hillel and Carnap Semantic Paradox (BCP)\nThe Scandal of Deduction (SOD)\n\n\nBCP refers to the fact that Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of\nsemantic information assigns maximal information to contradictory\nsentences. Where \\(\\perp\\) is an arbitrary contradiction, given that\n\\(\\perp\\) will be false in all possible worlds, we have the following\nvia\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3)\n respectively: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tCont(\\perp) &= W\\; (\\text{i.e., maximal content})\\\\ \\tcont(\\perp) &= 1\\\\ \\inf(\\perp) &= \\infty\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nBar-Hillel and Carnap (1952: 229) responded to this situation as\nfollows:\n\n\nIt might perhaps, at first, seem strange that a self-contradictory\nsentence, hence one which no ideal receiver would accept, is regarded\nas carrying with it the most inclusive information. It should,\nhowever, be emphasised that semantic information is here not meant as\nimplying truth. A false sentence which happens to say much is thereby\nhighly informative in our sense. Whether the information it carries is\ntrue or false, scientifically valuable or not, and so forth, does not\nconcern us. A self-contradictory sentence asserts too much; it is too\ninformative to be true.\n\n\nThere are two dimensions to this response that have caused concern in\nphilosophical circles. The first is that their notion of semantic\ninformation is non-factive\u2014semantic information does\nnot need to be true. The second is that they are taking their notion\nof semantic information to underpin informativeness in some\nnon-trivial sense.\n\nSOD refers to the fact philosophical accounts of information are yet\nto give an account of the informativeness of logical truths and\ndeductive inferences. Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s theory of semantic\ninformation assigns minimal information to logical truths (and valid\ndeductive inferences can be transformed into logical truths by\nconjoining the premises into an antecedent of a conditional that takes\nthe conclusion as its consequent). Where \\(\\top\\) is an arbitrary\ntautology, given that \\(\\top\\) will be false in all possible worlds,\nwe have the following via\n (1),\n (2), and\n (3)\n respectively: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\tCont(\\top) &= \\varnothing\\\\ \\tcont(\\top) &= 0\\\\ \\inf(\\top) &= 0\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWith respect to logically true sentences returning a minimal\ninformation value, Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1952: 223) respond as\nfollows:\n\n\nThis, however, is by no means to be understood as implying that there\nis no good sense of \u2018amount of information\u2019 in which the\namount of information of these sentences will not be zero at all, and\nfor some people, might even be rather high. To avoid ambiguities, we\nshall use the adjective \u2018semantic\u2019 to differentiate both\nthe presystematic sense of \u2018information\u2019 in which we are\ninterested at the moment and their systematic explicata from other\nsenses (such as \u201camount of psychological information for the\nperson P\u201d) and their explicata.\n\n\nWe will return to SOD briefly in\n section 3.2\n below. Note here however that Hintikka (1970, 1973) mounted a\ntechnically heroic if ultimately unsuccessful attempt to solve it (see\nSequoiah-Grayson (2008)), and for a properly detailed investigation,\nsee the entry on\n logic and information.\n For now we must recognise that the response of Bar-Hillel and Carnap\nabove brings with it some noteworthy philosophical claims of its own.\nFirstly, Bar-Hillel and Carnap are suggesting that the type of\ninformation which is encoded by logical truths and for which the\namount encoded is non-zero, is psychological in some sense or other.\nFurthermore, it may vary for one person from the other even with\nrespect to the same logical truth. Secondly, they are heeding the\nfollowing advice of Claude Shannon, the originator of the mathematical\ntheory of communication, given just two years earlier.\n\n\nThe word \u2018information\u2019 has been given different meanings\nby various writers in the general field of information theory. It is\nlikely that at least a number of these will prove to be useful in\ncertain applications to deserve further study and permanent\nrecognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of\ninformation would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible\napplications of the general field. (1950 [1993: 180]).\n\n\nShannon is advocating a rich informational pluralism, for a\ndetailed development of which see Allo (2007). Shannon\u2019s advice\non this point was, as we are about to see, nothing if not\nprescient.\n1.2 Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic information\n\nLuciano Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic\ninformation (2004, 2005), is a response to BCP motivated by the\nbelief that something has gone essentially amiss with Bar-Hillel and\nCarnap\u2019s theory. The suspicion is that their theory is based on\na semantic principle that is too weak, namely that truth-values\nare independent of semantic information. Floridi\u2019s proposal\nis that an approach according to which semantic information is factive\ncan avoid the paradox, and that the resulting theory is more in line\nwith our ordinary conception of what generally counts as information.\nThe line of argument is that a theory of strongly semantic\ninformation, based on alethic and discrepancy values rather than\nprobabilities, can successfully avoid BCP. Relatedly, see Bremer and\nCohnitz (2004: chap. 2) for an overview of Floridi\u2019s theory to\nbe described below, and Sequoiah-Grayson (2007) for a defence of the\ntheory of strongly semantic information against independent objections\nfrom Fetzer (2004) and Dodig-Crnkovic (2005).\n\nBefore we expound Floridi\u2019s approach, note that some have\nproposed a different alethic approach, one that uses truthlikeness, or\nverisimilitude, to explicate the notion of semantic\ninformation\u2014Frick\u00e9 (1997), Cevolani (2011, 2014), and\nD\u2019Alfonso (2011). Typically these seek to identify factual\ninformation with likeness to the complete truth about all empirical\nmatters or about some restricted relevant domain of factual interest.\nThese also avoid the BCP, and also do not use probabilities. However,\ntruthlikeness is different from truth itself in as much as a truth\nbearer can be truth-like without actually being true, i.e., while\nbeing false, so that verisimilitude accounts of information can permit\nthat false claims may possess information. Indeed false statements can\nsometimes carry more information than their true negations on this\naccount, see Frick\u00e9 (1997).\n\nBy contrast, Floridi\u2019s strongly semantic factive information is\ndefined as well-formed, meaningful, and truthful data. This\nlatter factivity constraint on semantic information has come to be\nknown commonly as the veridicality thesis (VT) (prefigured in\nMingers (1995, 1996a, 1996b)). Importantly, versions of VT arise in\ndebates about the ontological status of information in general, not\nmerely with regard to semantic information in particular\u2014see\nDretske (1981) for a classic example. Once the content is so defined,\nthe quantity of strongly semantic information in a proposition \\(p\\)\nis calculated in terms of the distance of \\(p\\)\nfrom a situation \\(z\\) (where\nsituations are partial or incomplete worlds) that \\(p\\)\nis supposed to model.\n\nWhen \\(p\\) is true in all cases, but also when \\(p\\)\nis false in all cases, there is maximal distance (as\nopposed to maximal closeness) between \\(p\\) and the\nsituation \\(z\\) that \\(p\\) is supposed\nto model. By contrast, maximum closeness is equivalent to the\nprecise modelling of \\(z\\) at the agreed level of\nabstraction or descriptive adequacy. Maximal distance in the\ndirection of truth will result in \\(p\\) being true in\nall cases in which case \\(p = \\mathord{\\top}\\) and is minimally\ninformative. Similarly, maximal distance in the direction of falsity\nresults in \\(p\\) being false in all cases (all possible\nsituations or probability 0) in which case \\(p = \\mathord{\\perp}\\) and\nis minimally informative also. The important difference here is that\nany distance in this direction is distance bereft of strongly\nsemantic information entirely. This is on account of distance in\nthe direction of \u201cthe false\u201d violating the factivity\ncondition on strongly semantic information.\n\nFloridi distinguishes informativeness from strongly semantic\ninformation itself. This is welcome, since strongly semantic\ninformation is factive, whereas false statements can still be\ninformative. Indeed a false statement \\(s\\) may be\nmore informative than a true statement \\(s'\\), in spite of\nthe fact that \\(s'\\) carries strongly semantic information whereas \\(s\\)\ndoes not. By way of example, suppose that you are\nrunning a catering contract for an event, and that there will in fact\nbe exactly 200 people in attendance. Suppose that \\(s\\)\nis there will be 201 people in attendance, and \\(s'\\) is\nthere will be between 100 and 200 people in attendance.\n\\(s'\\) is true whilst \\(s\\) is false, but \\(s\\)\nis more informative than \\(s'\\) on any natural\nunderstanding of the concept informative.\n\nWhere \\(\\sigma\\) is a piece of strongly semantic (hence true)\ninformation, and \\(z\\) is the target situation that it\ndescribes with total accuracy, the more distant \\(\\sigma\\) gets from\n\\(z\\), the larger the number of situations to which it\napplies and the lower its degree of informativeness. Floridi uses\n\u2018\\(\\Theta\\)\u2019 to refer to the distance between a true\n\\(\\sigma\\) and \\(z\\) (recall that Floridi is not\ninterested in non-factive information, and might well deny that there\nis any sensible such commodity). \\(\\Theta\\) indicates the degree of\nsupport offered by \\(z\\) to \\(\\sigma\\). Given a\nspecific \\(\\sigma\\) and a corresponding target \\(z\\),\nFloridi maps the values of \\(\\Theta\\) onto the x-axis of a Cartesian\ndiagram. We now need a formula to calculate the degree of\ninformativeness \\(\\iota\\) of\n\\(\\sigma\\)\u2014\\(\\iota(\\sigma)\\)\u2014in relation to\n\\(\\Theta(\\sigma)\\). Floridi\u2019s proposal is that we calculate the\nvalue of \\(\\iota(\\sigma)\\) via the complement of the distance of\n\\(\\Theta(\\sigma)\\) squared:\n\\[\\iota(\\sigma) = 1 - \\Theta(\\sigma)^2\\]\n\nValues of \\(\\iota\\) range from 0 to 1 and are mapped along the y-axis\nof the Cartesian diagram.\n Figure 1\n shows the graph generated by\n (10)\n when we include negative values for false \\(\\sigma\\). \\(\\Theta\\)\nranges from \\(-1 = \\mathord{\\perp}\\) to \\(1 = \\mathord{\\top}\\):\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nResponses and extensions\n\nFloridi (2012) extends the theory of strongly semantic information\ninto matters of traditional epistemology. His network theory of\naccount involves an argument for the claim that should strongly\nsemantic information be embedded within a network of questions and\nanswers that account for it correctly, then this is necessary and\nsufficient for the strongly semantic information to count as\nknowledge. Floridi (2008) develops a theory of\nrelevant semantic information in order to articulate a theory\nof epistemic relevance. Here he argues that the nature of\nrelevant semantic information is an additional vindication of the\nveridicality thesis. In Floridi (2011) he further explores just what\nit might, or should mean for semantic information to be true. Rather\nthan accept a correspondence, coherence, or pragmatic theory of truth,\nhe develops what he calls a correctness theory of truth for\nthe veridicality thesis, one which connects directly with his network\ntheory of account described above.\n\nFloridi (2006) argues that the modal logic KTB is well placed to play\nthe role of a logic of being informed (KTB is system\nB described in the entry on\n modal logic.)\n KTB itself licenses a version of the veridicality thesis within the\ncontext of being informed, \\(I_\\alpha p\\to p\\) (where \\(I\\)\nis a universal modal operator, on account of the\naxiom \\(\\square p\\to p\\) being an axiom of KTB). \u201cBeing\ninformed\u201d is understood as a cognitive state distinct from both\nknowledge and belief. Allo (2011) provides a formal semantics for the\nlogic of being informed, in both pure and applied versions. Primiero\n(2009) rejects the veridicality thesis for a logic of\nbecoming informed. Primiero\u2019s logic of becoming\ninformed is a logic of epistemic constructive information, within\nwhich the definition of information requires it to be kept distinct\nfrom truth. Epistemic constructive information understands information\nfor propositional content in terms of proof-conditions as opposed to\ntruth-conditions.\n\nMore broadly, Dinnen and Brauner (2015) search for a single definition\nof information (be it semantic or not) and find the veridicality\nthesis to be obstructive. By contrast, Mingers and Standing (2018)\nargue for a single definition of information that supports the\nveridicality thesis. Allo (2007) preempts such concerns with an\nargument for an informational pluralism (analogous to a\n logical pluralism,\n see the entry) via a realist interpretation of semantic\ninformation itself. A realist interpretation of semantic information\nleads naturally to the question of how it is that semantic information\ncan emerge from and be a part of the natural world\u2014a question\nthat is addressed in detail in Vakarelov (2010). The question of how\nit might be that information could be accounted for naturalistically\nhas a rich history in philosophy, most notably in informational\nsemantics covered in the following section.\n\nAlthough Floridi\u2019s, and Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s stance on\nsemantic information is not uncontroversial ( sans an\ninformational pluralism that is), Floridi\u2019s motivating intuition\nhas some philosophical precedent. Firstly, it is unlikely that many\nare satisfied with Bar-Hillel and Carnap\u2019s claim that \u201cA\nself-contradictory sentence asserts too much; it is too informative to\nbe true\u201d. Secondly, with regard to logical truths having zero\nsemantic information on Floridi\u2019s account, recall that as\nWittgenstein put it with typical bluntness\u2014\u201cAll the\npropositions of logic say the same thing, viz nothing. They are\ntautologies\u201d (Tractatus, 4.46, 6.1). One way to\nunderstand Floridi\u2019s theory of strongly semantic information is\nas a theory of the information we get from and about our particular\nobjective physical environment, as our physical environment is one\nabout which contradictions and logical truths are typically maximally\nuninformative. Semantic conceptions of information designed to tell a\nnaturalistic story about the content of our putatively referring terms\nhave a rich history of their own in philosophy, and this is the topic\nto which we now turn.\n2. Information, Modes of Presentation, and Meaning\n\nTheories of meaning that turn on modes of presentation have been\ncommon in philosophy in one way or another since Frege\u2019s\nSense and Reference. The story is as follows. There must be\nmore to the meaning of a referring term than its referent, since terms\ncan co-refer. For example, James Newell Osterberg Jr. and\nIggy Pop both refer to the same individual. In spite of this\nthe intuition that they do not mean the same thing is strong.\n\u201cIggy Pop is Iggy Pop\u201d and \u201cIggy Pop is James Newell\nOsterberg Jr.\u201d do not seem to mean the same thing.\nSimilarly, it seems to be the case that \u201cAlice believes that\nIggy Pop was the singer in The Stooges\u201d might true, whilst\n\u201cAlice believes that James Newell Osterberg Jr. was the singer\nin The Stooges\u201d might be false, at least on one natural reading\nthat is in line with our intuitions with regard to meanings.\n\nFrege\u2019s well known response is that both the referent and the\nsense of a referring term play a role in specifying its semantic\ncontent. But what is the sense of a term? Frege\u2019s own way of\ncashing out the notion of sense is in terms of a mode of\npresentation (MOP), an idea used by many later philosophers. The\nMOP of a referring term is the way in which the putative referent of\nthe term is presented to us by our phenomenology. MOPs are what we\nwould use in an attempt to identify or locate the referent of a\nreferring term whose meaning we grasp. Many contemporary theories of\nmeaning that turn on information, incorporate MOPs in one way or\nanother. The reason for this is that although reducing the meaning of\na term to the information carried or transmitted by it alone is\nattractive, it has proven to be fraught.\n\nThe temptation to take meaning and information to amount to pretty\nmuch the same thing is a result of the following idea. The idea is\nthat the word \u2018cat\u2019 denotes the property of being a cat,\nand that it means cat because it expresses the concept cat,\nand the concept cat\nmeans cat. The concept cat means\ncat because it carries the information\n\\(\\langle\\)cat\\(\\rangle\\), and cat carries the\ninformation \\(\\langle\\)cat\\(\\rangle\\) because its instances or\ntokenings are caused, by and large, by cats. This is a nice idea. By\ntying meaning and information together and telling a causal\nstory about them, we have a naturalistic story to tell about the\ninformation that we get from our environment, and hence a naturalistic\nstory to tell about meaning. Such information-transmitting causal\nrelationships are information channels\u2014causal\nconnections that facilitate the flow of information between the source\nof information and the receiver. We should take care to note this\nstory is telling an informationally semantic story about\nsub-propositionally located pieces of information such as the\npredicate \u2018cat\u2019 and paradigmatic uses of singular terms.\nAs such it sits outside of the domain described by the theories of\nsemantic and strongly semantic information described above. In spite\nof this, we will see that a refinement of this story turns on tracking\naccuracy, if not truth itself.\n\nIn a series of influential works on this area of informational\nsemantics, Jerry Fodor (1990), and Fred Dretske (1981) proposed a\ntheory of semantics very much like the one outlined above (see the\nentry on\n causal theories of mental content).\n A noted problem for such an informational semantics has come to be\nknown commonly as the disjunction problem. The disjunction\nproblem is as follows. cat tokens are not\nalways caused by cats, they are sometimes caused by other things like\nsmall dogs for example (or by thoughts about balls of yarn or\nwhatever). Given this fact, if the story above is correct, then why\ndoes cat mean cat and not cat or\ndog? Fodor\u2019s (1990) response is in two stages.\n\nFirstly, Fodor\u2019s initial proposal is that non cat-caused tokens\nof cat are asymmetrically dependent on\ncat-caused tokens of cat. That is, there would\nnot be any non cat-caused tokens of cat had\nthere not been any cat-caused tokens of cat.\nSecondly, on Fodor\u2019s picture, meaning and information come\napart. The information carried by a token of a concept\ncovaries with its cause, whereas the meaning of a token is\nwhat all of the concept\u2019s tokenings have in common\u2014the\ninner vehicles of our cat tokenings, or their\nMOPs. Note that Fodor is not, strictly speaking, subsuming information\nas part of meaning, but rather teasing them apart. Our failure to\nappreciate that meaning and information come apart is, according to\nFodor, a consequence of the fact that firstly, they are very often\ncoextensive, and that secondly, \u2018means\u2019 is a homonym for\nboth semantic content (meaning) and information-carrying. Consider the\nfollowing two uses of \u201cmeans\u201d:\n\nSmoke means fire.\n\u2018Smoke\u2019 means smoke.\n\n\nOn Fodor\u2019s view, the first use is in the sense of\ninformation-carrying only. Smoke carries the information that there is\nfire, but that is not what it means semantically. What\n\u2018smoke\u2019 means, in the semantic sense, is smoke,\nand this is captured by the latter use of \u201cmeans\u201d above.\nOn Fodor\u2019s story, just as with \u2018cat\u2019 above,\n\u2018smoke\u2019 means smoke because it expresses smoke,\nand tokenings of smoke\nare caused paradigmatically (but not always!)\nby smoke itself. The \u201cnot always\u201d qualification is covered\nby the asymmetric dependence condition above. So far so good, but what\nabout non-existent objects such as bunyips? Non bunyip-caused bunyip\ntokens of bunyip cannot be asymmetrically\ndependent on bunyip-caused bunyip tokens of bunyip\nbecause there are no bunyips around to cause\nanything at all.\n\nIn light of non-existent objects such as bunyips, and the\nmeaningfulness of bunyip tokens in spite of\nthere being no bunyips, Fodor adjusts his proposal so that meaning now\nrests on asymmetrical dependences among nomological relations\namong properties\u2014the property of being a bunyip for\nexample\u2014as opposed to actual causal relations between\nindividuals. Nomological relations are cashed out in terms of\ncounterfactuals, so what we have now is an informational semantics\nalong the lines of the following\u2014bunyip\nmeans bunyip because if there were bunyips, bunyips\nwould be the cause of bunyip tokens\non which all other causes would depend asymmetrically.\n\nRecall again that Fodor is teasing meaning and information apart.\nGareth Evans (1982) formulates a similar informational theory of\nmeaning, but one where information and MOPs are both subsumed within\nthe semantic story itself. For Evans, a full story about the meaning\nof thoughts about particular objects that are\u2014putatively at\nleast\u2014in the world, needs to take account of both the causal\norigins of the thought, as well as the MOP engendered by it. Evans\ncalls such thoughts information based particular thoughts,\nand such thoughts will be well grounded if and only if the\nobject satisfying the MOP and the object at the source-end of the\ncausal route are one and the same thing.\n\nWhat the Fodor/Dretske and Evans theories of informational semantics\nhave in common, is that they recognise that the meaning or\ncontent/object of a thought is robust across causal variation:\n\n\nWe want to be able to say that two informational states (states of\ndifferent persons) embody the same information, provided that they\nresult from the same initial informational event. (Evans 1982:\n128\u2013129)\n\nInformational theories\u2026appeal to reliable covariances while\nquantifying over the causal mechanisms by which these covariances are\nsustained. By doing so, they explain why information (indeed, why the\nvery same information ) can be transmitted over so many different\nkinds of channels. (Fodor 1990: 100)\n\n\nMoreover, although Evans did not put things in quite these terms,\nFodor, Dretske, and Evans all recognise information channels\nas robust entities in their own right.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Recanati (2012, 2016), has proposed a detailed version\nof informational semantics, his mental files theory, within\nwhich information channels play a central role. Recanati\u2019s\nmental files are cognitive counterparts to singular terms, and as such\nare referring concepts. Recanati\u2019s view looks very similar to\nEvan\u2019s information based particular thoughts at first glance.\nHowever, on Recanati\u2019s view, metal files contain information\nin the form of MOPs of an object\u2014be they given directly\nand experientially, or indirectly via descriptions\u2014their\nreference is not fixed by the information that they contain/their\nmodes of presentation. Rather, the reference of a metal file is fixed\nby the relations on which this file is based, and the\nreferent of a mental file will be the entity or object with which we\nare acquainted correctly in virtue of such relations obtaining. So\nRecanati is allowing that MOPs contain information themselves, rather\nthan restrict the role of information to the reference fixing relation\nitself (as do Evans and Fodor). The feature that identifies these\nrelations is that they are epistemically rewarding (ER)\nrelations. For Recanati, a relation is an ER relation in virtue of the\nfact that it is the sort of relation that makes the flow of\ninformation possible. In other words, ER relations are\ninformation channels.\n\nRecanati\u2019s ER relations draw heavily on Lewis\u2019s (1983)\nrelations of \u201cepistemic rapport\u201d\u2014causal chains that\nwould permit information flow, or information channels under another\nname. Both Recanati and Lewis recognise the disjunction problem by\nallowing that both information and misinformation may be transmitted\nalong information channels. Recanati\u2019s take is that the\nreference of a mental file is fixed by the object that sits at the\ndistal end of the information channel that contributes to the\ninformation that the mental file contains, irrespectively of the\n\u201cfit\u201d. Fit may of course be bad on account of noisy\nchannels and/or misidentification on the agent\u2019s behalf. As\nRecanati puts it:\n\n\nThe role of a mental file based on a certain acquaintance relation is\nto store information acquired in virtue of that relation. The\ninformation in question need not be veridical; we can think of it in\nterms, simply, of a list of predicates which the subject takes the\nreferent to satisfy. The referent need not actually satisfy the\npredicates in question, since the subject may be mistaken. Such\nmistakes are possible because what determines the reference is not the\ncontent of the file but the relevant relation to the object. The file\ncorresponds to an information channel, and the reference is the object\nfrom which the information derives, whether that information is\ngenuine information or misinformation. (2012: 37\u201338)\n\n\nIt reads here as though Recanati is conflating a mental file on the\none hand, with the information channel that carries its informational\npayload. Indeed Recanati goes on to argue that there are two sensible\nand \u201cdistinct notions of file\u201d (p. 82). The first notion\nis simply a repository of evolving information that appears to be and\nmay be about a single distinct object. The second notion of file, what\nRecanati calls the \u201cproper notion\u201d, involves both\na specific relevant information channel, and the repository\nof information acquired via that channel.\n\nAlong with Fodor, Dretske, Evans, Recanati, and Lewis, Frank Jackson\n(2010) also articulates a semantic theory based upon information\nchannels that supervene on causal relations, along with MOPs.\nJackson\u2019s MOPs are identified with descriptions.\nJackson\u2019s description theory of reference for proper names turns\non information channels, which are articulated in terms of causal\nlinks that underpin information flow. Jackson\u2019s motivating idea\nis that names are by and large sources of information about the\nentities that they name. The descriptive dimension is a function of\ntheir (the descriptions) being specified in terms of\ninformation-carrying causal connections\u2014information\nchannels.\n\nFor Jackson, language is, in general, a representational system that\ntransmits information about the way that things are taken to be to\nthose who comprehend the language. When names are used in declarative\nsentences, speakers are representing things as being a certain way.\nThe use of names in such contexts is to deliver putative information\nabout the way things are to other speakers in the language community.\nAccording to Jackson, names do this as a function of their being parts\nof information channels that exist between users of the language, and\nthe world. In order for us to track the information channel itself for\nthe purposes of getting information from it, we must understand the\nstructured connection between linguistic items (words and sentences),\nand ways that the world might be. Names themselves facilitate this\npractice in virtue of their being elements in the information channels\nthat exist between us and the world. These channels are created by\nconventions of language use and established practices of baptism.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of information channels in the theories above, it\nis no surprise that information channels have become a topic of study\non their own terms. The theory of information channels has made\ncontributions to information-based analysis of natural language and\nformal semantics.\n3. The Theory of Information Channels\n\nThe theory of information channels, channel theory, emerged\nfrom\n situation semantics\n (see the entry), with the latter being motivated by the observation\nthat meaning depends on systematic regularities in the world, and that\nsuch regularities are a necessary condition on our grasping any\nmeanings at all (Barwise 1993). Jon Barwise and John Perry (1983)\nappealed to this observation in order to justify and motivate a\nnaturalistic theory of meaning. Early work in situation theory\nconcentrated on situations themselves, thought of best as partial\nworlds in modal parlance. Importantly, situation theory itself\ndealt with the formal side of things in terms of set theory as opposed\nto modally, although as we will see below, modal interpretations have\ncome to dominate.\n\nSituation theory focused on constraints early on, with\nconstraints thought of most usefully as conditionals.\nSituation theory builds its semantic theory on an Austinian theory of\ntruth\u2014where an utterance \\(u_s\\) of a declarative sentence \\(s\\)\nis putting forward a claim that is about some type of\nsituation \\(x\\), such that \\(x\\) is of\nsome type \\(\\phi\\) (Barwise 1993: 4). Austin (1950) calls the type\n\\(\\phi\\) the descriptive content of \\(s,\\) with \\(\\phi\\) specifying\nthe type of situation (or event or thing etc.) in the world that is\nbeing described. He calls the situation \\(x\\) itself\nthe demonstrative content of \\(s\\). In other\nwords, \\(\\phi\\) describes the content of \\(s\\), and \\(x\\)\nis the content demonstrated by \\(s\\)\u2014which\nis just to say that it is the part of the\nworld about which the utterer of \\(u_s\\) is speaking when they utter\n\\(s\\).\n\nAccording to Barwise, for any conditional statement if \\(s_1\\)\nthen \\(s_2\\), such that the descriptive content of \\(s_1\\) is of\ntype \\(\\phi\\), and the descriptive content of \\(s_2\\) is of type\n\\(\\psi\\), the descriptive content of if \\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\)\nis the constraint \\(\\phi\\to\\psi\\). Constraints are connections between\ntypes. The demonstrative content of if \\(s_1\\) then\n\\(s_2\\) will be a connection between the demonstrative contents\nof \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\). Supposing that \\(x\\) is the\ndemonstrative content of \\(\\phi\\), and \\(y\\) is the\ndemonstrative content of \\(\\psi\\), the demonstrative content of if\n\\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\) will be a connection between \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), with this connection being\nan information channel \\(c\\) between \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\), written \\(x\\cmapsto y\\). As\nBarwise puts it succinctly:\n\n\nBy an information channel, let us mean one of these relations\nbetween situations, since it is these relations which allow\ninformation about one situation to be gleaned from another situation.\n(1993: 5)\n\n\nThe proposal in sum is that when we express a constraint\n\\(\\phi\\to\\psi\\) by way of uttering if \\(s_1\\) then \\(s_2\\),\nwe are making a claim to the effect that there is an information\nchannel supporting the constraint. For an information channel to\nsupport a constraint, Barwise\u2019 proposal is the following:\n\\[\\text{If }x\\vDash\\phi, \\:x\\cmapsto y,\\text{ and } \\phi\\to\\psi, \\text{ then } y\\vDash \\psi\\]\n\n(11)\n states that if information of type \\(\\phi\\) is true at the situation\n\\(x\\), and there is an information channel \\(c\\)\nfrom the situation \\(x\\) to the\nsituation \\(y\\), and there is a constraint from\ninformation of type \\(\\phi\\) to information of type \\(\\psi\\), then\ninformation of type \\(\\psi\\) is true at the situation \\(y\\).\n\nBarwise refines the notion of a situation to that of\n\u201csite\u201d\u2014a structured object that contains\ninformation. We now have sites \\(x,\\) \\(y,\\) \\(z,\\)\u2026 and types\n\\(\\phi,\\) \\(\\psi,\\)\u2026, where \\(x:\\phi\\) is read as the\ninformation site \\(x\\) is of type \\(\\phi\\). With\nthe qualification that the channels may or may not be among the sites,\nand that \\(x\\cmapsto y\\) is a three-place (ternary) relation between\ninformation sites and channels. Barwise formulates the Soundness\nAxiom for channel theory as follows:\n\\[c: \\phi\\to\\psi \\text{ iff } \\text{ for all sites } x, y, \\text{ if } x\\cmapsto y\\text{ and } x:\\phi, \\text{ then } y:\\psi.\\]\n\nAt this stage, things are starting to look decidedly modal in\nspirit, if not in practice.\n\nBarwise and Perry\u2019s situations and Austin\u2019s\ndemonstrative contents, are simply partial worlds under a\ndifferent name. That is, they are incomplete possible worlds.\nAustin\u2019s types, the descriptive contents of statements,\nare looking very much like propositions\u2014in particular the\nproposition that describes the claim being made by an utterance. With\na little bit of license, we might think of Austin\u2019s\ndemonstrative content of a statement as that statement\u2019s\ntruthmaker in a fine-grained sense. Barwise\u2019 notation\nin\n  (11)\n above with respect to \\(x\\vDash\\phi\\) betrays this reading. Moreover,\ngiven that \\(x\\cmapsto y\\) is a ternary relation,\n (12)\n is starting to look very much like a semantic clause for the\nconditional that turns on a three-place accessibility relation in\nsomething like a Kripke frame.\n\nThe semantics from Routley et al.\u2019s (1982) relevance logic\ngives the evaluation conditions on a three-place accessibility\nrelation, where the notion of an accessibility relation is familiar\nfrom their role in Kripke frames, used to specify the semantics of\nmodal logic. Barwise notes the connection explicitly:\n\n\nThe work presented here work also suggests a way to think about the\nthree-place accessibility relation semantics for relevance logic of\nRoutley and Meyer. (I have discussed this with both Gabbay and Dunn\noff and on over the past year. More recently, Greg Restall has\nobserved this connection, and has begun to work out the connection in\nsome detail.) (1993: 26)\n\n\nRestall (1996) along with Mares (1996) work out this connection as\nfollows. Restall assumes that channels are amongst the\ninformation sites (Mares does not). Instead of information\nsites, common terminology speaks of information\nstates. Information states may be incomplete and/or\ninconsistent, indeed they may be sub-propositional entirely (as will\nbe the case below when we look at fine-grained information-based\nsemantics for natural languages based on informationalised versions of\nthe Lambek Calculi). In Kripke/frame semantics terms, we have\nternary information frame \\(\\mathbf{F}:\\langle S,\n\\sqsubseteq, R\\rangle\\), where \\(S\\) is a set of\ninformation states, \\(\\sqsubseteq\\) is a partial order on \\(S\\),\nand \\(R\\) is a ternary accessibility\nrelation on members of \\(S\\). An information\nmodel is an information frame \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) along with an\nevaluation/supports relation \\(\\Vdash\\) between members of \\(S\\)\nand types/propositions \\(\\phi, \\psi\\ldots\\). How\nexactly we read \\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) is going to depend on what sort of\ninformation state \\(x\\) happens to be, and what type of\nthing \\(\\phi\\) is. The simplest case will be when \\(x\\)\nis a situation and \\(\\phi\\) is a proposition. In this case we may read\n\\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) as \\(\\phi\\) is true at \\(x\\).\nGiven this much,\n (12)\n is translated as follows:\n\\[x\\Vdash\\phi\\to\\psi\\text{ iff }\\forall y, z \\text{ s.t. } Rxyz, \\text{ if }y\\Vdash\\phi\\text{ then }z\\Vdash\\psi.\\]\n\nIn this context, the way that \\(Rxyz\\) is read is\u2014if you take\nthe information that is true at \\(x\\), and you put it\ntogether with the information that is true at \\(y\\),\nthen you get the information that is true at \\(z\\).\nHowever, \\(Rxyz\\) is not read so strictly in general. Although the\n\\(\\Vdash\\) relation can be read as a straightforward semantic\nrelation in line with \\(\\vDash\\), it is considerably more flexible.\nOther readings \\(x\\Vdash\\phi\\) include \\(x\\)\ncarries the information that \\(\\psi\\), \\(x\\)\ncarries the information of type \\(\\psi\\), \\(x\\)\nsupports the information that/of type \\(\\psi\\),\n\\(x\\) is a record of the information that/of type\n\\(\\psi\\), and so on. As a consequence of this, the way that\n\\(Rxyz\\) is read in practice will depend the applications to which the\nresulting information-based semantic models are being put\u2014that\nis, on the domain of the information channels in question.\n\nThe domain of information channels might be anything from channels for\npropositionally structured environmental information along the lines\nFloridi is interested in (be it veridical or not), or\nsub-propositionally structured environmental information along the\nlines Fodor and Evans are interested in. Moreover, it might be\nlinguistically focused sub-propositionally structured information from\nnatural language semantics, or concern semantic informational\nphenomena familiar from issues in the philosophy of language such as\nattitude reports and the semantic analysis of epistemic and other\nattitudinal states. We will examine such approaches in some detail in\nthe section below.\n\nFor now, note that semantic models of different information channel\ntypes will be individuated in terms of how it is that the\n\u201cputting together\u201d of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nin \\(Rxyz\\) is understood precisely. For\nexample, putting \\(x\\) together with \\(y\\)\nmight mean the same thing as putting \\(y\\)\ntogether with \\(x\\), or it might not,\ndepending on whether or not one wants the ternary relation \\(R\\)\nto be a commutative relation. That is, on\nwhether or not one wants it to be the case the \\(\\forall x\\;\\forall\ny\\;\\forall z(Rxyz\\to Ryxz)\\) Whether or not one does want \\(R\\)\nto be a commutative relation will depend on\nproperties of the information channels that one is trying to model\n(for which see the paragraph above).\n\nBy analogy, recall modal logic, where different properties of the\ntwo-place accessibility relation \\(R^2xy\\) will generate different\nmodal logics (for example, to get the modal logic \\(T\\)\none makes \\(R^2xy\\) reflexive, to get the modal logic \\(S4\\) one makes\n\\(R^2xy\\) reflexive and transitive and so on). Similar decisions can\nbe made with regard to the ternary relation \\(Rxyz\\). For example, one\nmight want \\(Rxyz\\) to have the properties of commutativity,\nassociativity, contraction, monotonicity,\nand others, or none at all, or subtle combinations of these and more.\nThese decisions will generate different logics of information\nchannels in the same way as do the choices on \\(R^2\\) with regard\nto different modal logics. These logics are known in general as\nsubstructural logics on account of the way the properties of the\nternary accessibility relation (commutation etc.), correspond to the\nstructural rules that individuate the logics themselves. (One may\nthink of structural rules as the syntactic/proof-theoretic\ncounterparts to the semantic conditions being discussed presently.) As\na part of the growing field of\n logic and information\n more generally, we will see in the following section that clusters of\nsuch logics have found utility across a range of\ninformational-semantic phenomena.\n3.1 The semantics of information flow\n\nA group of weak substructural logics known as the Lambek\ncalculi reject all structural rules, or else one or the\nother of either commutation or association, or possess both of these\nrules only. Designed by and named after Joachim Lambek, these logics\nwere designed originally to model the syntax, or formal grammar, of\nnatural languages (see the entry on\n typelogical grammar).\n\nThat they have found a home modelling\u2014providing a semantics\nfor\u2014information flow across information channels is not as\nsurprising as it might seem initially. Firstly, with some license we\nmay think of a natural language lexicon as a database, and a grammar\nas a specification of the processing constraints on that database such\nthat the processing constraints guarantee well-formed outputs.\nSecondly, one of situation and channel theory\u2019s targets\noriginally was natural language semantics itself, so the convergence\nis far from totally surprising. For example, Massimo Poesio (1993)\nappeals to the formal nomenclature of situation theory in order to\nbuild a theory of definite descriptions. Ginzburg (1993) uses the\nnaturally fine-grained structures of situation theory to give a\nsemantics for propositional attitudes. Hwang and Schubert (1993)\nimplement natural Language Processing (NLP) controls via a situation\ntheoretic framework. Westerh\u00e5ll, Haglund and Lager (1993) appeal\nto situation theory to give a theory of text meaning where\ntexts are treated as abstract states coding readers\u2019 cognitive\nstates.\n\nBarwise, Gabbay, and Hartonas (1995, 1996), appeal to the\nassociative Lambek calculus in order to model, that is to\ngive a semantics for, information flow itself. They define an\ninformation network \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) as a quadruple such that\n\\(\\mathbf{N} := \\langle S, C, \\mapsto, \\circ\\rangle\\), where \\(S\\)\nis a set of information states (called\n\u201csites\u201d by the authors), \\(C\\) is a set of\ninformation channels, \\(\\mapsto\\) is a ternary accessibility relation\non \\(S \\times C \\times S\\), and \\(\\circ\\) is an associative binary\ncomposition operator on \\(C\\). For information to flow,\nthere must be some way in which channels compose so that information\ncan flow from one channel to another. The authors specify the\nfollowing constraint on serial channel composition. For all channels\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\\[\\forall x\\; \\forall y (x \\overset{a\\circ b}{\\longmapsto} y\\: \\text{ iff }\\ \\exists z(x\\overset{a}{\\mapsto} z \\text{ and } z\\overset{b}{\\mapsto} y))\\]\n\nThe author\u2019s argue for channels associating, hence the binary\ncomposition operator on channels being associative, i.e., for all\nchannels \\(a,\\) \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), if\n\\(a\\circ(b\\circ c)\\), then \\((a\\circ b)\\circ c\\)). Those familiar with\ncategory theory will know the refrain \u201cchannels\nassociate!\u201d.\n\nCare is needed so as to not conflate channel composition as\nspecified above in\n (14),\n with the channel application specified above in\n (12)\n and\n (13).\n The latter involves feeding a channel its input, whereas the former\ninvolves the compositions of channels themselves. Tedder (2017) argues\nelegantly for the composition and application of information channels\nto be treated separately, and that we should not expect the properties\nof both (specified via structural rules on the ternary relation\n\\(\\mapsto\\) to be the same. For arguments with regard to just what\nproperties it is that we should expect channel composition\nand application to possess, see Tedder (2021) and Sequoiah-Grayson\n(2021). Sequoiah-Grayson (2010) argues that a basic theory of\ninformation flow with a semantics given by the Lambek calculi gives us\nan informational interpretation of the dynamic predicate\nlogic (DPL) of Groenendijk and Stokhof (1991).\n\nVan Benthem (2010), by contrast, argues against the temptation to\nunderstand Lambek calculi in such foundational informational terms.\nThis is not to suggest that van Benthem is opposed to extended\napplications of the Lambek calculi. For example, van Benthem (1996)\nargues for an application of the Lambek calculi for the purpose of\ngiving a dynamic semantics for cognitive procedures. Van\nBenthem\u2019s use of the Lambek calculi for a dynamic semantics of\ncognitive procedures, in combination with the use of\nsubstructurally interpreted Lambek calculi as a foundational model of\ninformation flow, leads naturally to the idea that models for\ndynamic epistemic phenomena might be given in information\nchannel-theoretic terms. We examine such information models in the\nfollowing section.\n3.2 Modelling epistemic phenomena informationally\n\nSedl\u00e1r and Pun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159 (2019) extend\npropositional dynamic logic (PDL) into the non-associative\nLambek Calculus, which they call Lambek PDL. They give Lambek\nPDL three informal interpretations, one in terms of actions that\nmodify linguistic resources, another in terms of actions that modify\nbodies of information, and another in terms of actions that modify the\nepistemic states of agents (see 2019: 358\u2013539). In their\nsemantics, specific readings of the ternary relation \\(R\\)\nfrom\n (13)\n above will depend on the interpretation of the information states in\ntheir models. In particular, they are interested in threshold cases\nwhere commutation, \\(x\\circ y = y\\circ x\\), breaks down for channel\napplication. Sedl\u00e1r (2020) extends the non-associative and\nnon-commutative Lambek calculus with iterative channel\noperations (both applicational and compositional) under an\ninformational interpretation.\n\nSedl\u00e1r (2016) designs and explores substructural epistemic\nlogics under an informational interpretation with the explicit goal of\nattending to the Scandal of Deduction (SoD) from\n section 1.1\n above. The motivating idea here is that there are channels from one\nepistemic state of an agent to another epistemic state of that agent,\nand that certain epistemic actions (namely acts of reasoning) that\nfacilitate information flow along such channels can be captured by the\nternary relation \\(R\\) that marks channel application\nin\n (13)\n above. Pun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159 and Sedl\u00e1r (2017) introduce\na substructural epistemic logic for pooling information in a\ngroup of agents via structured communication (viz. structured\ninformation flow) between them. In this context the binary combination\noperator \\(\\circ\\) (\u2018\\(\\cdot\\)\u2019 in Sedl\u00e1r and\nPun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159\u2019s notation) is a pooling operator\nbetween the different epistemic states of agents in a\ncommunicative group. The authors\u2019 have several examples to\nsuggest that both association and commutation are misguided in this\ncontext. Sedl\u00e1r, Pun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159, and Tedder (2019)\nprovide a semantics for universal and common knowledge operators via\nthe now-familiar informational reading of the non-associative Lambek\nCalculus under an informational interpretation.\n4. Summary\n\nAt this point it is clear that semantic conceptions of information\ncover a large amount of territory, but not one without structure of\ncohesion.\n\nCarnap and Bar-Hillel\u2019s (1952) theory of semantic information\nfor formal languages has an intuitive starting point, one that takes\nintensions and semantic information to be very closely related.\nWhatever the shortcomings of their theory, it has motivated an entire\nfield of research into the nature of semantic information via the\nsystematic informational approach to semantic and related phenomena of\nLuciano Floridi along with an increasingly large number of closely\nrelated research programs.\n\nThe information-based semantics for natural languages and content\nbearing mental states due largely to Dretske, Evans, Fodor, Lewis,\nJackson, Recanati, and Zalta has led to refined theories of meaning\nand content in terms of informational relations. Such\nrelations\u2014information channels that allow information to flow\nfrom one part of a system to another\u2014have proved to be so\nindispensable that they are in turn an object of research in their own\nright.\n\nThe semantic theory of information channels due largely to Barwise has\nbeen refined in such a way as to permit its adaptation for modelling a\nrich range of philosophical phenomena. Logics designed originally to\nmodel linguistic artefacts on their own terms have been used to\ncapture the properties of information flow. This has lead quickly to\nrigorously defined semantic models for such linguistic artefacts, as\nwell as to models for epistemic phenomena that are given in terms of\ninformation flow itself.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aczel, Peter, David Israel, Yasuhiro Katagin, and Stanley Peters\n(eds.), 1993, <em>Situation Theory and Its Applications, Volume 3:\nProceedings of the First-Third Conference on Situation Theory and Its\nApplications.
