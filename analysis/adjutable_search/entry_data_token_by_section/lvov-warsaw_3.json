    "main_text": "Logic || Investigations of classical propositional calculus\n3.2 Investigations of classical propositional calculus\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz formulated several axiomatic bases for the\nfunctionally complete propositional calculus, that is PC in which all\n16 binary connectives can be defined. The most popular is the\nN-C system, having as axioms the formulas:\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNppp, CpCNpq, and the usual\nrules of inference (substitution, detachment). This system is\nconsistent, independent, Post-complete (= semantically complete):\n\u0141ukasiewicz and his collaborators invented new methods for\nproving these properties. According to the criteria mentioned in the\npreceding section, one should look for the simplest axiom bases.\n",
