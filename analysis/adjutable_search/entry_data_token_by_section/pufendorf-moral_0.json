    "main_text": "The Method of Modern Natural Law || Modern Natural Law\n2.1 Modern Natural Law\n\nThe intellectual tradition with which Pufendorf is associated, and to\nwhich he was later seen as central, has been variously termed modern,\nsecular, or Protestant. Indeed, the first chapter of his Sample of\nControversies (Specimen controversiarum, 1678; in ES)\noriginated the historiography of the genre. (See section 5.2 below.)\nAs critics of that self-interpretation have pointed out and Pufendorf\nhimself admitted, elements of the approach were already present in\nprevious traditions, including Stoicism, Roman law, Christian and\nscholastic thought (particularly Vitoria, Vasquez, and Suarez), and\nthe Grotius commentary literature (Tierney 1997, Brett 1997,\nHaakonssen 1998, Seelmann 2000, Oakley 2005, Behme 1996, Hartung 2008,\nReibstein 1953\u201354). Still, Pufendorf and those who shared his\noutlook claimed a kind of Baconian novelty for their enterprise. This\nlay in its eschewal of metaphysics and theology as foundations for\nphilosophy, in its rejection of appeals to authority, and in its\nassertion of an \u2018eclectic\u2019 privilege not only to mix and\ncompare different perspectives, but also to place new bodies of\nknowledge on a so-called scientific footing (BW #137, 1996, p.194;\nHochstrasser 2000). The founder (in the sense of first practitioner)\nof this so-called \u201cnoble discipline of natural law\u201d was\naccording to Pufendorf \u201cthe incomparable Hugo Grotius,\u201d\nwho \u201cset out to construct a work wherein he was not ruled by the\ninfluence of his precedessors\u201d and that resisted the fragmenting\ntendencies of discrepant opinions (ES 2002b, p. 126).\nPufendorf\u2019s assessment was seconded by his French translator,\nJean Barbeyrac (1674\u20131744), who noted too \u2013 in his famous\nPreface (1706), \u00a728 \u2013 that with Bacon and Grotius\n\u201cthe Science of Morality was \u2026 rais\u2019d again from\nthe Dead\u201d (in DJN 2005 [1729], p. 78), and that it was Pufendorf\nwho had corrected, improved, and systematized it. (\u00a731) \n\nThe controversial beginning (and eventual locus classicus) of\nthe new approach, which would aspire to rigor and persuasion in morals\nand politics in the way that Descartes had sought them for science and\nmetaphysics, was Grotius\u2019s \u201cPreliminary Discourse\u201d\nor \u201cProlegomena\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 5\u20138) to On the\nRight of War and Peace (1625). For there, the Dutch classicist,\nambassador, and corporate counsel for the Dutch East India Company\nchallenged the moral relativism advocated by the ancient skeptic,\nCarneades, by laying out the basic requirements of communal living.\nUnlike Carneades, his professional concerns were not epistemological\nargument, moral proof, or philosophical system as such, but rather the\nconcrete mitigation of conflicts and the maintenance of peace.\nAppealing to a so-called principle of sociality or sociability\n(conceived as both presupposition and requirement), he sought to\nidentify the most general or minimal, and thus most widely acceptable,\nrights and laws of human association. These focused mainly, in his own\ncase, on international matters of war and peace, but in other natural\nlawyers like Pufendorf they addressed the entire range of human\naffairs. The modernity of the project, as well as its secularism, lay\nas noted in the intentional avoidance of biblical, theological, and\nconfessional presuppositions, and in the rejection of the essentialism\nand associated teleology of classical (abstract) realism \u2013 which\nwere thought to generate or exacerbate rather than to resolve\nintellectual and practical controversies (Forbes 1975, Tuck 1979 and\n1987, Todescan 2001, Ekardt and Richter 2006, Hunter 2007b). Instead,\nand in the manner of the physical sciences, the new discipline devised\nexplanations that emulated (somehow) mathematical reasoning and\nappealed to concrete observation, attempting thereby to create a\nshared outlook possessing theoretical coherence, empirical\nplausibility, and pragmatic effect (R\u00f6d 1970, Dufour 1980).\n\nThis reading of the modern natural law project is rooted in the texts,\nit was promoted by Barbeyrac, and it has been persuasively articulated\nmainly by Tuck (1979, 1987). However, aside from criticisms focused on\nits casting of Grotius and Hobbes (Mautner 2005, Sommerville 2001,\nZagorin 2000), it also seems wanting now as a comprehensive\ninterpretation of Pufendorf by being too inattentive to his more\nimmediate social and intellectual contexts. These included the\npolitical and confessional status of the Empire and, more\nspecifically, the metaphysical, theological, and Lutheran culture of\nnorthern Germany, Saxony in particular \u2013 as represented by\nconservative, Platonizing scholastics like Johann Benedict Carpzov,\nAdam Scherzer, Valentin Veltheim, and Valentin Alberti, with whom\nPufendorf and his younger colleague, Christian Thomasius\n(1655\u20131728), contended through much of their academic lives\n(Hunter 2007b, 2001; Palladini 1978; Sparn 1976). This conflict was\npractical and immediate as well as theoretical, affecting German\nacademic culture for another century up to and including Kant (Hunter\n2005). For the opponents propounded a theocratic politics guided by\nScriptural interpretation and supernatural metaphysics accessible only\nor especially to (philosophical) theologians, in contrast to the\nsecular conception of the state and its subsidiary institutions (such\nas the judiciary and the universities) proposed by Pufendorf and\nThomasius. In fact, the two readings may intersect and complement one\nanother. For Grotius, Hobbes, and also Descartes (especially his idea\nof philosophical liberation and innovation) certainly influenced\nPufendorf, albeit in a characteristically German, Protestant, and\nLutheran setting that he helped to transform with their assistance\n(Friedeburg 2008, Friedeburg and Seidler 2007, Dufour 2005, Schmoeckel\n2013b).\n\nClearly, early modern Protestantism was in this as well as other\nrespects a house divided, pitting those inclined to transcendent\nmetaphysics and theological authority against the innovators who\nrejected this approach. Of course, it is the latter stream \u2013 to\nwhich Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, C. Thomasius, (and sometimes Wolff)\nare seen to belong \u2013 that is intended by the characterization of\nearly modern natural law as distinctively \u2018Protestant\u2019.\nBecause of its rejection of scholastic rationalism and universalism,\nand its interest in the particular, the singular, and the irregular\n(Seidler 2011) on various levels of analysis (i.e., its appreciation\nof difference and insistence on dissent, its \u2018protestant\u2019\nand broadly anti-\u2018imperial\u2019 character), the discipline is\nalso aptly described as \u2018individualistic\u2019 (Haakonssen\n2004). And this feature links it, in turn, to the characteristic\n\u2018voluntarism\u2019 of the genre (Schneewind 1998, Haakonssen\n1998), in distinction to the generally intellectualist bent of both\nancient and medieval natural law (Hunter 2003b, Haakonssen and Seidler\n2015). Voluntarism acknowledged not only God\u2019s supreme and\nsingular omnipotence (exercised through the divine will), and thus the\n(to us) arbitrariness, contingency, and cognitive imperviousness of\nthe (created) world, but also humans\u2019 individual and collective\npower over, and thus responsibility for, their own actions and the\ninstitutional contexts regulating them. In sum, the approach was\nsecular rather than atheistic, as it typically combined relatively\nsparse convictions derived from natural theology (understood as a\nminimalist philosophical view about a creative, providential deity and\nhis formal role in generating moral obligation) with an emphasis on\npersonal religiosity and confessional neutrality, especially in the\npolitical sphere. That is, it privatized (and to some extent\nmoralized) religion, it demarcated theology from philosophy (Tully\n1991), and it denied theoretical and political advantage to\ndogmatists, including those inclined to play the God card from the\nside of reason or philosophical metaphysics.\n",
