    "main_text": "Aesthetics\n7. Aesthetics\n\nSchleiermacher tended to be quite self-deprecating about his\nsensitivity to and knowledge of art, and hence about his aptitude for\naesthetics (e.g., in On Religion and the\nSoliloquies, where he is clearly rather in awe of the greater\ntalent and expertise in this area that such romantic friends as the\nSchlegel brothers enjoyed), and accordingly tended to shy away from\ndiscussing the subject in detail in his earlier work. However, he did\neventually bring himself to confront the subject systematically,\nnamely, in his lectures on aesthetics (first delivered in 1819, and\nthen again in 1825 and 1832\u20133).\n\nPart of his motivation behind this eventual confrontation with the\nsubject\u2014and part of the reason why it remains interesting\ntoday\u2014derives from the fact that the phenomenon of art, and in\nparticular the phenomenon of non-linguistic art (e.g., painting,\nsculpture, and music), prompts a certain theoretical question that is\nof fundamental importance, not only for the philosophy of art itself,\nbut also for hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation, and for\nthe philosophy of language that underlies it: Do non-linguistic arts\nsuch as painting, sculpture, and music express meanings and thoughts,\nand if so how? This question is obviously important for the philosophy\nof art. But it is also important for hermeneutics, or the theory of\ninterpretation, because it carries in its train such further questions\nas whether the theory of interpretation ought not to treat additional\nforms of expression besides the linguistic ones that\nSchleiermacher\u2019s own hermeneutics treats, what the appropriate\nmethods of interpretation might be in such additional cases, and how\nsuch additional cases and their interpretive methods might relate to\nlinguistic ones. Moreover, the question mentioned is also important\nfor the philosophy of language that underpins Schleiermacher\u2019s\ntheory of interpretation, as embodied in principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n For a positive answer to this question might threaten those two\nprinciples, or at least show that they need significant revision.\n\nIn his last cycle of aesthetics lectures (1832\u20133) Schleiermacher\ninitially pursued a very simple strategy for dealing with these issues\nconcerning non-linguistic art. However, he soon realized that the\nstrategy in question was untenable, and abandoned it for a more\npromising but also more ambiguous position.\n\nHis whole train of thought there closely followed one that Herder had\nalready pursued in the Critical Forests (1769), so it may be\nuseful to begin with a brief sketch of the latter. By the time of\nwriting the Critical Forests Herder was already committed to\nhis own versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n Accordingly, in reaction to the phenomenon of the non-linguistic arts\nthe book initially set out to argue for a theory of their nature that\nwould preserve consistency with those principles, and it did so in a\nvery straightforward way, denying the non-linguistic arts any the\nability to express thoughts or meanings autonomously of\nlanguage by denying them any ability to express thoughts or meanings\nat all: whereas poetry has a sense, a soul, a force, music is\na mere succession of objects in time, and sculpture and painting are\nmerely spatial; whereas poetry not only depends on the senses but also\nrelates to the imagination, music, sculpture, and painting belong\nsolely to the senses (to hearing, feeling, and vision, respectively);\nwhereas poetry uses voluntary and conventional signs, music,\nsculpture, and painting employ only natural ones. However, as\nHerder proceeded with his book he came to realize that this simplistic\nsolution was untenable: in the third part of the book he stumbled upon\nthe awkward case of ancient coins, which, though normally\nnon-linguistic, clearly do nonetheless often express meanings and\nthoughts in pictorial ways. This realization did not lead him to\nabandon his versions of principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n however. Instead, it brought him to a more refined account of the\nnon-linguistic arts which was still consistent with those principles:\nthe non-linguistic arts do sometimes express meanings and thoughts,\nbut the meanings and thoughts in question are ones that are\nparasitic on a prior linguistic expression or expressibility of\nthem by the artist. In the fourth part of the book (which was not\npublished until the middle of the nineteenth century, and was hence\nunknown to Schleiermacher) Herder already extended this solution from\ncoins to painting; and in subsequent works he extended it to sculpture\nand music as well.\n\nSchleiermacher\u2019s aesthetics lectures follow a strikingly similar\ncourse. He at first sets out to develop a version of the theory that\nHerder had initially developed in the Critical Forests,\ncorrelating the several non-linguistic arts with the different senses\nas Herder\u2019s theory had done (his only significant revision here\nconsists in modifying Herder\u2019s correlation of sculpture with the\nsense of touch to include vision as well as touch). Like\nHerder\u2019s initial theory, Schleiermacher\u2019s is largely\nmotivated by his prior commitment to principles\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n which, again like Herder\u2019s initial theory, it seeks to\nvindicate in a naive way: non-linguistic arts, such as music and\nsculpture, do not express meanings or thoughts autonomously\nof language because they do not express them at all. For\nexample, Schleiermacher argues that music merely expresses\nphysiologically based \u201clife-conditions\n[Lebenszust\u00e4nde]\u201d, not representations or\nthoughts. However, rather like Herder with his ancient coins, in the\ncourse of developing this naive solution Schleiermacher stumbles upon\na case that forces him to the realization that it is untenable: He\ndevelops his naive solution smoothly enough for the cases of music and\npainting, but then in the middle of his discussion of sculpture he\nsuddenly recalls Pausanias\u2019s account that the very earliest\nGreek sculptures were merely rough blocks whose function was to serve,\nprecisely, as symbols of religious ideas (oops!). He\nsubsequently goes on to note that an analogous point holds for other\nnon-linguistic arts, such as painting, as well. Accordingly, at this\nstage in his lectures he changes tack. He now acknowledges that\nnon-linguistic arts do (at least sometimes) express meanings\nand thoughts after all, and he goes on to vacillate between two new,\nand mutually conflicting, accounts of that fact: (a) The arts in\nquestion do so in such a way that the meanings and thoughts involved\nare at least sometimes not (yet) linguistically articulable. (In\nparticular, he suggests that the early Greek sculpture just mentioned\nexpressed religious ideas that only later got expressed\nlinguistically.) This account would entail abandoning or at least\nseverely revising principles\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n (b) The arts in question do so in virtue of a pre-existing linguistic\narticulation or articulability of the same meanings and thoughts in\nthe artist. (Schleiermacher actually only says in virtue of\n\u201csomething universal\u201d, \u201ca representation\u201d, but\na dependence on language seems clearly implied.) This account is\nsimilar to Herder\u2019s final account, and, like it, would preserve\nprinciples\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n In the end, then, having renounced his initial\u2014clearly\nuntenable\u2014position, Schleiermacher is left torn between these\ntwo more plausible-looking positions, which, however, contradict each\nother.\n\nThe eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German hermeneutic tradition as\na whole was similarly torn between these two positions. As has already\nbeen mentioned, (b) was the considered position at which Herder\neventually arrived. But (a) had strong champions as well\u2014in\nparticular, Hamann, Wackenroder and Tieck, Hegel (concerning\narchitecture and sculpture), and the later Dilthey. The choice between\nthese two positions is a genuinely difficult one, philosophically\nspeaking.\n\nWhere does this leave Schleiermacher in relation to the several issues\nbearing on his hermeneutics and his philosophy of language that, I\nsuggested, encouraged him to undertake this investigation of\nnon-linguistic art in the first place? Concerning the primary\nquestion, whether the non-linguistic arts express meanings and\nthoughts and if so how, he has now realized that they do indeed (at\nleast sometimes) express meanings and thoughts, but he remains torn on\nexactly how they do so. Concerning his theory of interpretation, that\nrealization is already important, because it shows that interpretation\ntheory does indeed need to extend its coverage beyond linguistic cases\nto include at least some cases of non-linguistic art. But he remains\ntorn on the further issues in this area\u2014in particular, on\nwhether, as (a) implies, there will be cases in which the\ninterpretation of non-linguistic art will transcend the interpretation\nof any associated language or, as (b) implies, it will always be\ndependent on and restricted by the interpretation of associated\nlanguage. Finally, concerning the philosophy of language that\nunderpins his theory of interpretation, he remains torn about whether\nthe meanings and thoughts that are expressed by non-linguistic art are\nalways parasitic on language (position (b)), so that principles\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n can be retained without any qualification or modification, or they\nare instead sometimes independent of language (position (a)), so that\nprinciples\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n will either have to be abandoned or (with Hamann in his\nMetacritique [1784]) (re)construed in a way that stretches\ntheir reference to \u201clanguage\u201d and \u201cwords\u201d to\ninclude not-strictly-linguistic-or-verbal symbol use in the\nnon-linguistic arts.\n\nAnother motive behind Schleiermacher\u2019s treatment of art in his\nlate aesthetics lectures concerns its cultural status, especially\nrelative to religion. It was an abiding concern of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s from early in his career until the very end of\nit\u2014one that set him at odds with the predominant tendency of\nearly German romanticism\u2014to subordinate art to religion. The\nfinal cycle of the aesthetics lectures from 1832\u20133 is just the\nlast in a long line of attempts to achieve this goal. It seems to me,\nhowever, that, partly for reasons already touched on, this last\nattempt turns out to be oddly and interestingly self-subverting.\n\nLet us first briefly survey Schleiermacher\u2019s broader series of\nattempts to subordinate art, and then consider how this last one\nproves self-subverting. It was already one of the early\nSchleiermacher\u2019s main goals to turn contemporary culture, and\nespecially the romantic movement, away from the then fashionable idea\nthat art was the highest possible type of insight toward the idea that\nreligion was. This is an important part of the project of On\nReligion (1799), where he criticizes the sort of elevation of art\nabove religion that Goethe and Schiller had begun and the romantics\nhad then accentuated, complains of the trivial nature of modern art,\nand argues that art ought to subserve religion, as Plato had thought.\n(The early Schleiermacher was in a way strikingly successful in\nachieving his goal: after 1799, largely under his influence, the\nleading romantics did increasingly turn away from art toward religion,\nand to some extent the same was also true of German culture more\ngenerally.) The ethics lectures of 1812\u201313 continue the same\nproject in a certain way. There Schleiermacher represents art as of\nits very nature a collective expression of religious feeling (one that\ndiffers in accordance with the differences between religions). In\nother words, he represents art as only true to its own nature when it\nsubserves religion. The 1830 psychology lectures develop an\ninteresting variation on the same theme. There Schleiermacher argues\nthat the perception of beauty is a feeling but one that has a certain\nsort of deep cognitive content in that it expresses the relation of\nintelligence to Being. This makes it sound very much like religious\nfeeling, and indeed in these lectures it is treated as a sort of close\nsecond-in-command to religious feeling. It might seem as though, from\nSchleiermacher\u2019s standpoint, there was a danger here of art\nacquiring too independent and exalted a status. However, that danger\nis in part averted by the fact that he is here talking primarily about\nnatural beauty, and only secondarily about artistic\nbeauty.\n\nThe 1832\u20133 aesthetics lectures continue this sort of\nart-demoting project, but in a different way. Schleiermacher\u2019s\ninitial intention there, it seems, was to demote art (in comparison\nwith religion) in two respects: First, as we saw, the lectures\ninitially set out to give an account of non-linguistic arts (music,\npainting, and sculpture) that represents them as merely expressive of\nsensuous feelings and non-cognitive in character. Second, the lectures\ngive an account of poetry that represents it as merely national and\nindeed individual in nature, not universal like science and (at least\nin a way) religion. Thus the lectures argue that art generally, and\ntherefore poetry in particular, is national in nature, not universal,\nand more radically that it indeed has the function of expressing\nindividuality, of resisting even the commonality of a national\nlanguage (thereby making explicit a potential that is also present,\nthough less fully realized, in normal language use).\n\nHowever, as I suggested, this twofold strategy for demoting art turns\nout to be curiously self-subverting. For one thing, as we saw, the\nmodel of non-linguistic art as merely sensuous and non-cognitive in\nthe end proves to be unsustainable. Moreover, not only does\nnon-linguistic art turn out to have a cognitive content after all, but\nin addition that fact becomes clear from a case (the earliest Greek\nsculpture) in which the content in question is not trivial but deeply\nreligious in character. Furthermore, this self-subversion would be\neven more extreme if position (a) won out over position (b) in the\nend. For another thing, poetry\u2019s function of expressing\nindividuality implies that for Schleiermacher it represents the\nhighest ethical value (for more on individuality\u2019s high\nstatus in Schleiermacher\u2019s ethics, see below). In short, what\nwas intended as a demotion of art turns willy-nilly into a sort of\ncognitive-religious and ethical exaltation of it.\n",
