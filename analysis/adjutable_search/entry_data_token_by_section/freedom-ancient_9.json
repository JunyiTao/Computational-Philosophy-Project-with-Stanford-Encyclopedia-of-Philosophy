It is not mentioned in any of the extant texts by Epicurus\nhimself, but a variety of later sources attribute the doctrine to him.\nThe two most extensive discussions we have of the swerve\u2019s role\nin protecting human freedom are in Cicero\u2019s On Fate,\nwhich describes how the swerve is needed in order to preserve the\nopenness of the future and avert the fatalistic implications of the\nPrinciple of Bivalence, and in lines 251\u2013293 of Book 2 of On\nthe Nature of Things, Lucretius\u2019 exposition of Epicurean\nphysics.\n\nLucretius argues that is evident that animals can and do act freely.\nHowever, if atoms did not sometimes randomly swerve to the side,\nanimals would not be able to act freely. Therefore, atoms sometimes\nrandomly swerve to the side. In this argument, Lucretius moves from\nsomething he thinks we can observe (that animals act freely), and on\nits basis infers something that we cannot directly perceive (that\natoms swerve slightly to the side). Free actions are ones where the\nbody follows the mind\u2019s desires (DRN 2.268), and free\nactions have an \u201cinternal source\u201d in a literal sense for\nLucretius: they are produced by the animal\u2019s mind, which is a\nbodily organ in its chest.\n\nLucretius spends most of his argument establishing the premise that\nanimals do, in fact, act freely, by giving two examples. Both examples\nare supposed to show that animals have an internal capacity to\ninitiate motion, which distinguishes animal motion from the way in\nwhich inanimate objects are simply moved around by external blows. The\nfirst example is of race horses eager to burst from the starting\ngates. Lucretius claims that we see a slight delay between the\nexternal stimulus of the opening of the gates and the resultant motion\nof the horses surging forward. This delay supposedly shows that there\nexists motion initiated by the mind, in which case it takes some time\nfor the decision of the mind to stir together and move all of the\nmatter of the horse. The second example appeals to our own experience,\nin cases such as being in a jostling crowd: we are not always\nhelplessly shoved around by these outside forces but are sometimes\nable to fight against them to go where we wish, and we initiate this\nmotion ourselves.\n\nUnfortunately, Lucretius is much less forthcoming in supporting or\nelucidating his other premise. If there were not a swerve, and causal\ndeterminism were true, why would animals be unable to act freely? And\nhow exactly is the swerve supposed to help preserve freedom? At the\nstart of his argument, Lucretius says that if there were not an atomic\nswerve, to prevent all motion from being interlinked in an endless\nchain of causation and thereby to annul the decrees of fate, we would\nnot have the ability to move ourselves around as we wished. And at the end\nof his argument, Lucretius says that, in order for our actions not to\nbe subject to an \u201cinternal necessity\u201d, there must be an\natomic motion that is not necessitated, since nothing comes to be from\nnothing (DRN 2.284\u2013293). A number of answers to the above\nquestions have been advanced, but each of these interpretations\nsuffers from philosophical and textual problems. Below are some of these\nanswers.\n2.4.1 Free will and the ability to do otherwise\n\nA common way of answering these questions is to say that free will is\nincompatible with causal determinism because determinism precludes us\nfrom having the ability to do otherwise than we do, and this ability\nis needed to have free will (Purinton 1999). Human beings are\naggregates of atoms, and our decisions are caused by the motions of\nthe atoms that make up our minds. If the atoms that make us up moved\nin accordance with deterministic laws\u2014if we were subject to\n\u201cinternal necessity\u201d\u2014then we would be unable to act\notherwise than how we do act. But because the atoms in our mind can\nswerve, then it is possible for me to do otherwise than I do. There is\na range of possible outcomes for any action I take, depending on\nwhether, when, and how many atoms in my mind swerve. And so, I have\nfree will and can be rightly held responsible for my actions.\n\nOne problem with this interpretation is that Lucretius does not seem\nconcerned with moral responsibility or the ability to do otherwise.\nThe Latin phrase Lucretius uses for what allows us to \u201cact\nfreely\u201d is libera voluntas, which is often translated\nas \u201cfree will\u201d. But libera voluntas is not\nsomething particular to adult humans, who can be held morally\nresponsible for their actions. It is shared by all animals. And\nlibera voluntas is not described as an ability to do\notherwise, which allows animals to be accountable for what they do.\nInstead, libera voluntas is effective agency; it allows\nliving creatures all over the earth to do what they want to\ndo and to advance wherever pleasure leads them (DRN\n2.251\u2013260). And in any case, inserting random atomic swerves into\none\u2019s mind is an unpromising basis for the production of free\nand responsible actions; instead, it would seem to result in random\nand blameless twitches. Let us imagine that after thinking things\nover, I am getting ready to pick up the phone and accept a job offer,\nbut before I pick up the phone, a series of atomic swerves occur in my\nmind, and I start singing Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the\nChampions\u201d instead. Is the singing a free and responsible\naction? Or if I do pick up the phone and accept the job, does the\npossibility that random atomic swerves might have caused me to sing\ninstead help preserve my free will? To the extent that random swerves\nare involved in action, they seem to undercut our control over our\nactions, rather than preserve it.\n2.4.2 Character development and internal necessity\n\nAlternatively, it has been proposed that the Epicureans\u2019 concern\nis with our control over character development, which Epicurus\ndiscusses in On Nature book 25, not free will (Furley 1967;\nBobzien 2000). If determinism were true, how we develop would be\nnecessitated\u2014our current character would be the inevitable\nresult of eternal chains of cause and effect, and traceable entirely\nto external factors of environment and heredity beyond our control.\nLucretius is referring to this threat when he talks about the\n\u201cinternal necessity\u201d that the swerve saves us from by\nbreaking the chains of cause and effect. Once again, however,\nLucretius\u2019 concern when he describes the swerve does not seem to\nbe the ability of humans to shape their own character development, or\nthe way determinism may threaten it. And leaving that worry aside,\nhaving the process of character development caused in part by random\natomic swerves seems no better than having it caused entirely by\ndeterministic atomic motions, as far as our control over it. What is\nneeded is not to falsify determinism, but to preserve our ability to\nuse our reason to change ourselves.\n2.4.3 The self and emergence\n\nIn On Nature 25, Epicurus says that how we develop depends on\nus, and not on the nature of our atoms. Based on this assertion and\nsome other passages in On Nature 25, David Sedley (1983,\n1988) argues that Epicurus believes that how we act is not determined by\nthe atoms that make up our minds. Instead, from complex atomic systems\nlike the atoms that makes up our minds, there emerges human reason,\nour desires, and other psychological entities, which cannot be\nidentified with atomic states. All together, these entities make up\nthe person, or the self. According to Sedley, Epicurus thinks that the\nself acquires causal powers that transcend the laws that bind atomic\nmotion and that can even \u201creach down\u201d and cause changes to the\natoms that make up my mind, and thereby initiate actions. However, the\nself would not be able to exercise this power if physical laws were\nsufficient on their own to determine all atomic motions. As a minimal\nindeterminacy at the atomic level, the swerve allows the self\n\u201celbow room\u201d where it can exercise its power to act one\nway or the other within the laws of physics, but in a way\nthat is not determined by the laws of physics.\n\nOn Nature 25, however, is extremely unclear. The\nbetter-preserved and clearer texts we have by the Epicureans that deal\nwith their philosophy of mind, such as On the Nature of\nThings and The Letter to Herodotus (Epicurus\u2019\nsummary of his physics) seem to support an identity theory of\nmind\u2014that the mind is just a bodily organ (like the brain, but\nlocated in the chest), and that psychological states and events are\nthe same as atomic states and events. The passages cited to support an\n\u201cemergent self\u201d do not obviously commit Epicurus to the\nposition, and they can be read in a way that is consistent with an\nidentity theory of mind. And even if Epicurus did believe in an\nemergent self that acquires causal powers that transcend the powers of\nthe atoms, he would not need to posit the swerve. The \u201claws of\nphysics\u201d simply sum up the effects of a number of causal factors\nthat determine how an atom will move, like its weight and its\ncollisions with other atoms. If there really were an emergent and transcendent self, that self would add another causal factor that could\nmove the atoms. There doesn\u2019t need to be an antecedent\nindeterminacy to ensure that the atoms can be moved by the self. In\nhis solution to the fatalist \u201clazy argument\u201d (see section\n1.3), Carneades says something along these lines: once we have a\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d that obeys us, we do not\nneed a random swerve to help ensure our freedom.\n2.4.4 Bivalence and the swerve\n\nFinally, the swerve may do nothing more than fulfill the function,\ndescribed above, that Cicero gives to it in On\nFate\u2014because of the swerve, statements about what will\nhappen in the future are, at present, neither true nor false. And so,\nwhat will happen is not inevitable, and our deliberations about what\nto do and our actions are not futile (O\u2019Keefe 2005). This fits\nwith Lucretius\u2019 description of how determinism threatens our\nlibera voluntas\u2014if each motion were linked to a prior\nmotion from eternity, animals would not be able to do what they want\nto do and to advance wherever pleasure leads them. So the swerve is\nnot directly involved in the production of free action, it simply\nhelps dispose of one threat to our freedom, the one spelled out by the\nfatalist argument: if the Principle of Bivalence were true, and\napplied to statements about the future, the future would be\nnecessitated, and we would be helpless.\n\nHowever, the Epicureans need not have such concerns about the\nPrinciple of Bivalence. If the Stoics are right, neither the Principle\nof Bivalence nor causal determinism would rob us of freedom, since\naction and deliberation can still be effective even if the Principle\nof Bivalence holds and causal determinism is true. However, if one is\nnot convinced by the Stoics, then Carneades\u2019 position seems more\ncogent than Epicurus\u2019. To secure our ability to shape the\nfuture, what matters is our ability to control our actions in a way\nthat is not causally predetermined\u2014Carneades\u2019\n\u201cvoluntary motion of the mind\u201d\u2014whereas positing a\nrandom atomic motion to falsify a logical principle is beside the\npoint. And if the swerve has no direct role either in the production\nof action or the formation of our character, it is unclear what\nLucretius might be referring to when he says that the swerve saves us\nfrom \u201cinternal necessity\u201d.\n\nNo matter which interpretation is correct, it looks like introducing\nan atomic swerve to preserve our freedom was not a good idea.\n2.5 The Stoics on what is \u201cup to us\u201d, the principle of alternate possibilities, and punishment\n\nThe Stoics are materialists, and they believe that every action we\nperform is causally determined by god as part of his divine plan. This\nmight seem to make us helpless puppets of god, puppets who cannot rightly be held responsible for what we do. The Stoics, however, develop\na theory of animal behavior generally and human action in particular\nthat tries to counter this suspicion. Like both Aristotle and\nEpicurus, for the Stoics, the possession of reason is key to making humans responsible\nfor their actions.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, inanimate objects like logs and stones are\nmoved around from the outside. Animals, however, move themselves\naround. Animal motion has an internal source, the animal\u2019s own\nmind, which is a material, bodily organ. The Stoics\u2019 distinction\nbetween inanimate and animate motion is reminiscent of\nLucretius\u2019 distinction between the passive way inanimate objects\nare moved around, compared to the active motion of animals, which have\nlibera voluntas and can move themselves around as they wish.\nThe Stoics, however, believe that animals moving themselves around is\ncompatible with the way in which animals move being causally\ndetermined. Animals move themselves when an impression occurs which\narouses an impulse. For instance, a hungry dog may see a hunk of meat,\nand this arouses an impulse to run up to the meat and eat it. The\nimpulse is triggered by the impression, but this is still a case of\nthe dog moving itself toward the meat, not merely being passively\npushed around by the impression.\n\nIn the case of rational animals, like humans, there is a crucial\nadditional step. We have \n\n\nreason, which passes judgment on impressions, rejecting some of these\nand accepting others, in order that the animal may be guided\naccordingly. (Origen, On principles 3.1.2\u20133, LS 53A) \n\n\nFor instance, I may see a pulled-pork sandwich in front of me when I\nam hungry. But instead of saying, \u201cMmmm, looks good\u201d, and\nstraightaway gobbling it down, I think \u201cEating meat produced by\nfactory farms would be wrong\u201d and refrain. On the other hand,\nChrysippus believes that animals are made for the sake for human\nbeings\u2014for instance, that appetizing pigs have no purpose other\nthan slaughter and that god created them as part of our cuisine\n(Porphyry, On Abstinence, 3.20.1, 3, LS 54P). And so, given\nhis foolish and vicious views about the moral status of animals,\nChrysippus would gladly decide to chow down on a pulled-pork\nsandwich.\n\nAny action proper will include this step of assent to an impression\nthat leads to an impulse, and it is this additional step that\ndistinguishes human action from mere animal behavior. This does not\nmean that actions require extended and self-conscious deliberation. If\nyou insult my hipster sideburns and I straightaway get angry and punch\nyou in the face, I have assented to the impression that you have\nwronged me and it would be good to retaliate and cause you pain, even\nthough I haven\u2019t thought it over carefully.\n\nTo illustrate the Stoic doctrine of the internal source of animal\nmotion Chrysippus uses the analogy of a stone cylinder rolling down a\nslope. The cylinder\u2019s rolling down the slope may require an\ninitial shove. But that initial shove only triggers the motion, and\nthe primary cause of the motion is the cylinder\u2019s own shape and\n\u201crollability\u201d. Likewise, human action may require an\ninitial impression as its trigger, but how a person acts depends on\nthe person themself, on the sort of person they are and how they\nrespond to their impressions (Cicero, Fat. 39\u201343, LS\n62C).\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and assent is the cause\nof our actions. Therefore, our actions are attributable to us, and we\nare rightly held responsible for them. I do not control whether I am\nhealthy, although I can aim at maintaining my health. I do not\ncontrol whether other people hurl insults at me, but it is up to me\nwhether I react angrily when I am insulted. What we do is controlled\nby our will and intellect, and the misdeeds of bad people can rightly\nbe attributed to their own vice (Gellius, Noctes Atticae,\n7.2.6\u201313, LS 62D).\n\nThe Stoics reject the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP). We\ndon\u2019t have \n\n\nthe freedom to choose between opposite actions \u2026 [instead], it\nis what comes about through us that is up to us. (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 13, 181,13, LS 62G1) \n\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and we are rightly\nheld responsible for what we do, even though we do not have the\nability to do otherwise than we do. If we accept PAP, then the actions\nof the virtuous person will be praiseworthy only if they are capable\nof acting in a way other than how they do act. But the truly virtuous\nperson is incapable of acting viciously, of doing anything wrong.\nImagine that I am a virtuous person, and that I have promised my young\ndaughter a piece of cake if she finishes her dinner. She finishes her\ndinner and asks for the cake. There is only one action that I can and\nwill do in that particular situation: give her the cake as promised.\nLet us suppose that there was some small chance that I would\nnot keep my promise\u2014that I\u2019d pretend to look for the cake\nand not find it, and lie to her about its being missing, so that I\ncould have it for myself later. If I were capable of depriving my\ndaughter of her promised cake so that I could chow down on it later,\nthen I would not really be a virtuous person. There would have to be\nsomething wrong with me. And so if we accept PAP, we would have to\naccept the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for\nacting virtuously, as they cannot do anything other than the virtuous\naction in any situation. And so, we should reject PAP (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 26, 196,24\u2013197,3, LS 61M).\n\nAristotle would say that the virtuous person will not break\ntheir promise to their daughter, but that they are capable of\ndoing so. The Stoics reject this response. Virtue is a reliable\ndisposition to do what one should. I am not forced to get the\ncake for my daughter, but if I am truly a good person, I am incapable\nof doing otherwise, because I cannot but want to get her the cake\n(Seneca On Benefits 6.21.2\u20133). The Stoics conceive of virtue\nas a kind as practical skill that allows a person to live well, and\nthe wise person will consistently exercise this skill, so that\neverything they do they do well (Stobaeus Eclogues\n2.66,14\u201367,4, LS 61G). So an \u201cability\u201d to break my promise\nto my daughter is something I do not want to have, as it would be a\ndefect, a form of folly, and a disability.\n\nThe Stoics believe that their doctrine that god causally determines\nour every action is compatible with all of our ordinary moral\npractices. They share with Aristotle the idea that virtue is a\nperfection of our nature as rational and social animals, and they\nbelieve that the proper action to perform is the one that can be given\na reasonable justification. (See the texts in Long and Sedley sections\n59\u201361.) Let us suppose that causal determinism is true and that I\nbreak my promise to my daughter and chow down on the cake. Even if\nevery action is causally determined by God, right reason still\ncommands right actions and prohibits wrong ones. We can still give the\nreasons why breaking my promise to my daughter is irrational and\nwrong, and why keeping my promise would be rational and right. So,\neven though I was causally determined to break my promise, my doing so\nwas wrong. And if there are right and wrong actions, there are also\nvirtues and vices, character traits that dispose us to act rightly and\nwrongly, respectively. So, in the example above, I am a vicious\nperson: I am the kind of person who will break his promise to his\ndaughter for the sake of filling his belly. But virtue is noble, and\nthus commendable, whereas vice is shameful, and thus reprehensible.\nAnd commendable things deserve honor, whereas reprehensible things\ndeserve censure and punishment. So I am a shameful, reprehensible\nperson, and I am rightly criticized for my action (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 35, 207, 5\u201321, LS 62J).\n\nWhile the Stoics think that vicious people are responsible for what\nthey do, and that wrongdoing merits censure and punishment, they\nreject retributive punishment, punishment that seeks to set back a\nperson\u2019s interests as fitting payback for the wrong they have\ndone. Like god, the virtuous person wishes to harm none and to benefit\nall. We should regard ourselves as akin to all human beings, and we\nshould seek to benefit as many people as we can (Cicero Fin.\n3.62\u20138, LS 57F). Punishment is a fitting response to wrongdoing, but\nright punishment is rehabilitative, a loving correction of\nthe person punished (Alexander, On fate ch. 35, 207,5\u201321, LS\n62J). The model here is akin to parental discipline. If my sons are\nsquabbling, and one of them angrily hits the other, I might send him\nto time-out, deprive him of dessert, and ground him for a week. But I\ndo not do so because I want my son to suffer or I think he had it\ncoming to him. Instead, while my son might find the punishment\npainful, I inflict the punishment because I think that the discipline\nwill be good for him, that it will help him realize that he has done something\nwrong and that he needs to change himself. In their theory of\npunishment, as in much of their ethical theory, the Stoics are\nfollowing the lead of Plato, who also rejects retributive punishment\nin favor of rehabilitative punishment. (See in particular\nProtagoras 323d-324d and Gorgias 472d-479e.) Plato,\nhowever, rejects retribution in part because he believes that all\nwrongdoing is due to ignorance of what is good. Hence, he thinks,\nnobody does wrong willingly, and nobody is deserving of retributive\npunishment.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, both the virtuous, wise person and the\nvicious fool are responsible for their actions, because the actions of\neach of them are equally a result of their assent, which is under\ntheir control. Nonetheless, in another sense, only the wise person is\ntruly free (DL 7.33). The later Stoic Epictetus often compares the\nfoolish person to a slave, under the yolk of vicious and damaging\ndesires (for instance, Handbook 14 and Discourses\n2.2). Similarly, the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius likens the fool to\na puppet who is jerked here and there by irrational impulses (for\ninstance, Meditations 2.2, 6.16). The fool is dominated by\ndesires and beliefs that are alien to his nature as a rational being,\nbecause right reason commands all virtuous actions and forbids all\nvicious actions. Only the wise person is free from these alienating\nand disturbing desires and beliefs; only the wise person has mastered\nhimself and is in harmony with himself.\n 2.6 Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 incompatibilist Aristotelianism\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias is an adherent of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy, best known for his extensive commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s texts. In his treatise On Fate, Alexander\ndevelops an Aristotelian theory on human freedom in reaction to the\nStoics\u2019 clearly determinist and compatibilist theory.\nAlexander\u2019s theory is based on what Aristotle says, and he\nclaims simply to be presenting Aristotle\u2019s views. But\nAlexander\u2019s treatment takes many elements of Aristotle, which on\ntheir own can be read as either compatible with causal determinism or\nincompatible with causal determinism, and develops them in\nincompatibilist ways. Alexander thinks that causal determinism is\nincompatible both with effective deliberation and with the sort of\ncontrol over our actions needed for moral responsibility.\n\nThe Stoics identify fate with the causal organization of the cosmos.\nEvery thing that occurs has a cause which is sufficient to produce\nexactly that outcome. And given the totality of circumstances, it is\ncausally impossible for things not to turn out the particular way that\nthey do (Alexander, On Fate ch. 22). Alexander believes that\nhaving things causally determined by fate in this way is incompatible\nwith some outcomes being contingent. On the Stoic position, if there\nis going to be a sea battle tomorrow, the causal structure of the\ncosmos guarantees that there will be a sea battle tomorrow and makes\nit impossible that there not be a sea battle tomorrow (Alexander,\nOn Fate ch. 9). But deliberating about things that will\nnecessarily occur or necessarily not occur is pointless; it makes\nsense to deliberate only about things that can either possibly occur\nor not. Furthermore, if I deliberate about whether to instigate a sea\nbattle or not, it makes sense to do so only if I have the ability\neither to instigate a sea battle or not to do so. I do not deliberate\nwhether or not to fly if I cannot fly, or if I must fly\n(Alexander, On Fate ch. 11\u201312). So, effective deliberation\nrequires that a person have the ability to do otherwise than they do,\nand Alexander thinks that such an ability is incompatible with causal\ndeterminism.\n\nAlexander also believes that the Stoic position implies that our\nactions are not really \u201cup to us\u201d, i.e., that we do not\nhave the sort of control over our actions which is required to be\nrightly praised, blamed, rewarded, or punished for them. Alexander\nthinks this because he subscribes to something like the principle that\n\u201cought implies can\u201d, i.e., that a person can be morally\nobligated to do something only if they have the ability to do it. This\nis shown in our own case, when we feel regret and blame ourselves for\ndoing something because we think we were able not to choose to do the\nevil thing we had done (Alexander, On Fate ch. 12,\n180.29\u201331). And in the case of other people, too, we blame and punish\nthem on the assumption that they were able to refrain from wrongdoing.\nIf they had to do what they did, under the circumstances, they are\nblameless. (Alexander thinks that it is inadequate to say that they\nwould have acted differently if circumstances had been different;\nAlexander, On Fate ch. 16.)\n\nAlexander turns Chrysippus\u2019 analogy of the cylinder rolling down\nthe slope against the Stoic position. Chrysippus says that, while an\ninitial shove is required to get the cylinder moving, whether and how\nthe cylinder rolls depends on its shape, and likewise, while an\ninitial impression is needed to get a person moving, how they respond\nto the impression depends on the type of person they are, and thus\nthey are responsible for how they act. But, says Alexander, round\nthings must roll down a slope when shoved; it is not up to them\nwhether or not to roll. Instead, they are compelled to roll by a kind\nof internal necessity. And if the Stoics are right, vicious people are\nlikewise compelled by their vicious natures, by a kind of internal\nnecessity, to do their evil deeds (Alexander, On Fate ch.\n17).\n\nLike Carneades, Alexander believes that his own doctrine of free\nchoice doesn\u2019t introduce motion without a cause. A person has\nvarious motives they can act on: they may want to obtain this pleasure\nor that one, or to get something that they believe is to their\nadvantage, or to do something because they think it\u2019s the right\nthing to do. Nothing predetermines or necessitates what the person\nwill end up freely choosing to do: they might accept this job or that\none, given the competing considerations in favor of each, and they can\nvalue the pleasure of cake over the importance of keeping their\npromises, or vice-versa. But no matter what they end up choosing, they\nare the cause of their own choices and of the actions that result from\nthem (Alexander, On Fate ch. 15).\n\nBut what about the thoroughly virtuous person? Alexander agrees with\nthe Stoics that virtuous people are psychologically incapable of doing\nanything vicious. However, it does not follow that every action they\nperform is causally necessitated. There is often a range of available\nactions that are consistent with virtue, or some leeway in the\nprecise way in which they may do the action which virtue requires, and\nit is up to them which of these options they choose (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 29). Alexander also follows Aristotle in thinking that\npeople are responsible for developing their character through their\nown voluntary actions, in a way analogous to developing skills through\npractice. This, thinks Alexander, distinguishes virtuous humans from\nthe gods. Humans are not by nature virtuous. Instead, they have to\ndevelop their virtue, and they are capable of either becoming virtuous\nor not. And so, we praise the person who develops the virtues, because\nthe type of person they became was up to them. But the gods\nnecessarily possess their goodness as a kind of natural gift, and they\nare incapable of becoming bad. And so, because their goodness was not\nup to them, we rightly honor the gods for their goodness, but we do not\npraise them (Alexander, On Fate chs. 27, 32).\n 2.7 Plotinus on freedom and the good\n\nPlotinus is a follower of Plato, and in his attempt to spell out\nsystematically the truths contained in Plato\u2019s dialogues, he\nfounded the philosophical movement nowadays called Neoplatonism. He\ndevelops a distinctive position on human freedom, one that overlaps\nconsiderably with the Stoics\u2019 position. However, because of his\ndeep metaphysical differences with the Stoics, he breaks with them on\nthe role of fate in producing human action.\n\nFor Plotinus, to say that something is \u201cup to us\u201d is to\nsay that we have power or mastery over it. He contrasts this mastery\nwith servitude or slavery. True power is the power to do what we wish,\nin order to gain what we desire. So Plotinus thinks that a person who\nacts under compulsion is not acting freely. He also agrees with\nAristotle that a person who acts in ignorance of the particulars of\nhis situation is not acting voluntarily: if I inadvertently poison my\nmother with cyanide-laced Tylenol, I am not doing what I wished to do,\nas I did not wish to poison my mother. But he disagrees with\nAristotle, and agrees with Plato, in thinking that ignorance of the\nrightness or wrongness of what I propose to do excuses (Enn.\nVI.8[39].1). Plotinus believes that all desire is desire for the good\n(Enn. VI.8[39].7). If I poison my mother, I do so because I\nbelieve that doing so is good for me. But if I\u2019m wrong about\nthat, then when I kill her, I\u2019m not really gaining what I\ndesire, because I wanted to get what was good for me. (It\u2019s for\nthese sorts of reasons that Plato, in Gorgias 466c-468e,\ndenies that a tyrant who is able to kill, torture, or imprison anybody\nas he sees fit has great power. Power enables a person to get what\nthey desire, which is what is good for them, and the tyrant\u2019s\nso-called \u201cpower\u201d actually harms him.)\n\nFollowing Plato in the Republic, Plotinus repeatedly asserts\nthat for the mind to be controlled by the appetites or passions is a\nkind of slavery, because the mind is being controlled by something\noutside of itself (Enn. VI.8[39].2, VI.8[39].3). Reason\nshould rule the person, and an action is free if it proceeds from\nknowledge (Enn. VI.8[39].1, VI.8[39].6). So Plotinus joins\nthe Stoics in thinking that only the wise person is free.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d in this sense is primarily an ethical ideal, not\na condition on moral responsibility.\n\nBecause freedom is a power to obtain what is truly good for yourself,\nPlotinus also joins the Stoics in rejecting the principle that, in\norder to be in control of what you do, you must have the ability to do\notherwise than you do. Let us imagine that my daughter has a serious\nheart condition, and after researching the options to repair her\nheart, I follow the correct course of action, both because I love her\nand because I recognize that doing so is also good for me. If my\nreason is in charge of what I do, and I know that what I am doing is\nfor the best, then I am incapable of not doing what I do. But it not\nsome lack of power or external obstacle that prevents me from\nneglecting my daughter and doing what is worse. Instead, my action is\nan expression of my knowledge and my will, and that is why I cannot do\notherwise (Enn. VI.8[39].10). Likewise, Plotinus thinks it\nwould be perverse to say that I am forced or compelled to help my\ndaughter, that my action is involuntary because it springs from some\nsort of \u201cinternal necessity\u201d. Instead, an action is free\nwhen it is directed towards a good that you recognize, and slavery\nconsists in being powerless to move towards your good. This is the\nkind of freedom enjoyed by the divine intellect. Plotinus believes\nthat the Form of the Good, as described in places like book 6 of\nPlato\u2019s Republic, is the transcendent source of\neverything that exists. (Plotinus sometimes calls it the One, to\nstress its simplicity.) The divine intellect fully understands and\neternally contemplates the Good, and it does so freely\u2014for why\nwould it not do so? (Enn. VI.8[39].4)\n\nPlotinus wants to allow the wise person untrammeled mastery, and so he\nrestricts the scope of their freedom to their reasoning and will, and\nnot, strictly speaking, to their actions. If I am wise, I have control\nover my reasoning and the decisions I make on account of my reasoning.\nBut which actions I perform are not entirely up to me, but depend on\nexternal circumstances beyond my control. If I am a brave person, I\nwill stand ready to risk my life in war for a noble cause, but such a\nwar may never arise. And of course, the effects of my actions are not\nup to me\u2014perhaps my daughter will die of her heart condition\ndespite my best efforts (Enn. VI.8[39].5). However, because\nhappiness consists in wisdom and virtue, the wise person\u2019s\ninability to entirely control their actions or their actions\u2019\neffects does nothing to prevent them from having the sort of power\nthat matters\u2014the power to obtain what is good. This aspect of\nPlotinus\u2019 thought echoes the Roman Stoic Epictetus. In order to\nbe happy, says Epictetus, we must distinguish between what is up to us\nand what is not, and the one thing that god has placed under our\ncontrol is the correct use of impressions i.e., to decide rightly what\nto believe and what to do (Epictetus, Discourses 1.1.7\u201312, LS\n62K). Because Epictetus thinks that freedom consists in our control\nover an internal power of assent, Frede (2011) claims that the notion\nof a \u201cfree will\u201d first appears in Epictetus.\n\nDespite the considerable overlap between Plotinus and the Stoics on\nfreedom, they differ significantly on fate. The Stoics think that\ngod\u2019s mind is a fiery breath. It is a material substance that\npervades the cosmos and causally determines every event that will\noccur through its organization of the cosmos, which includes the\nmatter that makes up our own minds. The motions in the cosmos, then,\nare the result of both the operations of matter and\nof reason. Plotinus, on the other hand, distinguishes the causal\ninfluences of matter and of mind. The One, the divine intellect, soul,\nand our intellects are all immaterial, and bodies are the lowest form\nof beings. For Plotinus, any purely materialistic metaphysics, such as\nthe Epicureans\u2019 scheme of atoms moving in the void, cannot\nexplain the operations of mind, which stands above matter\n(Enn. III.1[3].3).\n\nPlotinus criticizes the Stoics because, on their theory, humans and\ntheir minds are parts of god, and god works his will through human\nactions. Plotinus believes that, if this were true, our decisions\nwould be caused by something outside of ourselves and would not really\nbe our own\u2014we would not be agents any more than our feet are,\nwhen we use them to kick something. (The Stoics would reply that\nhumans both move themselves and are moved by god through\nfate.) Furthermore, the Stoics\u2019 theory has the unacceptable\nresult of making god the cause of evil, when humans act wrongly\n(Enn. III.1[3].4). Instead, says Plotinus, we should hold\nthat human minds are genuinely separate things, and that they are\nself-movers, the cause of their own thoughts and decisions\n(Enn. III.1[3].4, III.1[3].8, III.2[47].7). Here, Plotinus\nagain follows Plato, who in his creation-myth the Timaeus\nasserts that human souls are distinct from the world-soul that\nanimates the cosmos (Tim. 41d).\n\nFor Plotinus, wrongdoing is involuntary, because it is always due to\nignorance, but the evil person is still its cause (Enn.\nIII.2[47].10). The wrongdoer is not culpable for what they do, but\nthey still suffer two sorts of punishments\u2014although these\npunishments might better be called \u201cconsequences\u201d. The\nfirst penalty they pay for their wrongdoing is becoming evil, which is\nbad for them (Enn. III.2[47].4; III.2[47].8; cf. Plato,\nLaws 728b-c). Secondly, our behavior in this life will have\nan impact on how we will fare in our future lives. Plotinus believes\nin a cycle of reincarnation in which past wrongs lead to future\nsuffering (Enn. III.2[47].12). Furthermore, the choices a\nperson makes within this life will determine the sort of animal (or\nplant) they are reincarnated as, with those who maintain the human\nlevel becoming humans once again, whereas those dominated by passions\nor appetites reincarnated as an appropriate sort of animal or plant\n(Enn. III.4[15].2).\n\nPlotinus develops his theory of reincarnation as a reading of\nPlato\u2019s Myth of Er, which closes the Republic\n(Rep. 614b-621d). In the Myth, disembodied souls between\ncycles of reincarnation have a variety of lives to choose between.\nWhich life they choose is entirely up to them, and the gods are not to\nblame. However, once they choose a particular life, they are bound by\nnecessity to that life and to the events within that life\u2014for\ninstance, a greedy soul chooses the life of a tyrant without examining\nit closely, only to realize after his choice that he is fated to eat\nhis children. On a literal reading, the myth seems to confine control\nover what will happen within one\u2019s life to the choice one makes\nprior to that life, as a disembodied soul. But Plotinus thinks that\nthe Myth is an allegory for how all of the soul\u2019s choices in\nthis life shape what will happen to it in the future (Enn.\nIII.4[15].3; III.4[15].5). It is better to be incarnated in some\nbodies rather than others\u2014it is better to be a human rather than\na wolf, and some humans have bodily temperaments more conducive to\ngoodness than others. Nonetheless, the body one is incarnated into\ndoes not determine what one will do; it is up to the soul what it will\ndo given the opportunities available to it within that life\n(Enn. III.4[15].5).",
