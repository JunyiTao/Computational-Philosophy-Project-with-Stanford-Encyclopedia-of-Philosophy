    "main_text": "Which Mental States Possess Qualia?\n2. Which Mental States Possess Qualia?\n\nThe following would certainly be included on my own list. (1)\nPerceptual experiences, for example, experiences of the sort involved\nin seeing green, hearing loud trumpets, tasting liquorice, smelling\nthe sea air, handling a piece of fur. (2) Bodily sensations, for\nexample, feeling a twinge of pain, feeling an itch, feeling hungry,\nhaving a stomach ache, feeling hot, feeling dizzy. Think here also of\nexperiences such as those present during orgasm or while running\nflat-out. (3) Felt reactions or passions or emotions, for example,\nfeeling delight, lust, fear, love, feeling grief, jealousy, regret.\n(4) Felt moods, for example, feeling elated, depressed, calm, bored,\ntense, miserable. (For more here, see Haugeland 1985, pp.\n230\u2013235).\n\nShould we include any other mental states on the list? Galen Strawson\nhas claimed (1994) that there are such things as the\nexperience of understanding a sentence, the\nexperience of suddenly thinking of something, of suddenly\nremembering something, and so on. Moreover, in his view, experiences\nof these sorts are not reducible to associated sensory experiences\nand/or images. Strawson\u2019s position here seems to be that\nthought-experience is a distinctive experience in its own right. He\nsays, for example: \u201cEach sensory modality is an experiential\nmodality, and thought experience (in which understanding-experience\nmay be included) is an experiential modality to be reckoned alongside\nthe other experiential modalities\u201d (p. 196). On Strawson\u2019s\nview, then, some thoughts have qualia. (This is also the position of\nHorgan and Tienson (2002).) \n\nThis view is controversial. One response is to claim that the\nphenomenal aspects of understanding derive largely from linguistic (or\nverbal) images, which have the phonological and syntactic structure of\nitems in the subject\u2019s native language. These images frequently\neven come complete with details of stress and intonation. As we read,\nit is sometimes phenomenally as if we are speaking to ourselves.\n(Likewise when we consciously think about something without reading).\nWe often \u201chear\u201d an inner voice. Depending upon the content\nof the passage, we may also undergo a variety of emotions and\nfeelings. We may feel tense, bored, excited, uneasy, angry. Once\nall these reactions are removed, together with the images of\nan inner voice and the visual sensations produced by reading, some\nwould say (myself included) that no phenomenology remains.\n\nIn any event, images and sensations of the above sorts are not always\npresent in thought. They are not essential to thought.\nConsider, for example, the thoughts involved in everyday visual\nrecognition (or the thoughts of creatures without a natural\nlanguage).\n\nWhat about desires, for example, my desire for a week\u2019s holiday\nin Venice? It is certainly true that in some cases, there is an\nassociated phenomenal character. Often when we strongly desire\nsomething, we experience a feeling of being \u201cpulled\u201d or\n\u201ctugged\u201d. There may also be accompanying images in various\nmodalities.\n\nShould we include such propositional attitudes as feeling angry\nthat the house has been burgled or seeing that the\ncomputer is missing on the list? These seem best treated as\nhybrid or complex states, one component of which is essentially a\nphenomenal state and the other (a judgment or belief) is not. Thus, in\nboth cases, there is a constituent experience that is the real bearer\nof the relevant quale or qualia.\n",
