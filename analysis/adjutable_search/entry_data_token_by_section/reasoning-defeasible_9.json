    "main_text": "Applications and Motivation || Defeasible Laws of Nature and Scientific Programs\n2.6 Defeasible Laws of Nature and Scientific Programs\n\nPhilosophers David M. Armstrong and Nancy Cartwright have argued that\nthe actual laws of nature are oaken rather than iron\n(to use Armstrong\u2019s terms). (Armstrong 1983; Armstrong 1997,\n230\u2013231; Cartwright 1983). Oaken laws admit of exceptions: they\nhave tacit ceteris paribus (other things being equal) or\nceteris absentibus (other things being absent) conditions. As\nCartwright points out, an inference based on such a law of nature is\nalways defeasible, since we may discover that additional\nphenomenological factors must be added to the law in question\nin special cases. \n\nThere are several reasons to think that deductive logic is not an\nadequate tool for dealing with this phenomenon. In order to apply\ndeduction to the laws and the initial conditions, the laws must be\nrepresented in a form that admits of no exceptions. This would require\nexplicitly stating each potentially relevant condition in the\nantecedent of each law-stating conditional. This is impractical, not\nonly because it makes the statement of each and every law extremely\ncumbersome, but also because we know that there are many exceptional\ncases that we have not yet encountered and may not be able to imagine.\nDefeasible laws enable us to express what we really know to be the\ncase, rather than forcing us to pretend that we can make an exhaustive\nlist of all the possible exceptions.\n\nMore recently, Tohm\u00e9, Delrieux, and Bueno (2011) have argued\nthat defeasible reasoning is crucial to the understanding of\nscientific research programs.\n",
