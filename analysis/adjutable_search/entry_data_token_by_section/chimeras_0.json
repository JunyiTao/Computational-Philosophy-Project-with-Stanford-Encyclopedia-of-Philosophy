    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nIn classical Greek and Egyptian myth, chimeras are depicted as having\nparts with the morphological characteristics typical of different\nspecies. The chimera of Greek mythology, for example, has the head of\na lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. Not all\nchimeras are mythical, however. In fact, each one of us is most likely\na chimera, according to the modern scientific definition of a chimera\nas a single organism composed of cells with different embryonic\norigins (Nagy and Rossant 2001). As we interact with other organisms\nover the years, their cells become incorporated into our bodies, not only\nthrough a process of consumption and digestion, but also through processes\nthat leave the cells intact. For example, pregnant women acquire cells\nfrom their fetuses and mosquitoes transfer blood between their\nsuccessive victims.  More exotic natural chimeras occur when\nearly-stage human embryos fuse in utero, resulting in a child with two\ndistinct genotypes.  Laboratory-created chimeras include the geep, an\nintraspecies chimera made by fusing a sheep embryo with a goat embryo\nor by transplanting cells from one embryo into another (Fehilly,\nWilladsen, and Tucker 1984; Polzin et al. 1987). Like the\nchimeras of myth, the geep exhibits morphological traits of multiple\nspecies, with wool on some parts of its body and hair on\nothers. Researchers have also created quail/chick chimeras by\ntransferring parts of the neural tube (the precursor of the central\nnervous system) from a quail embryo into a Leghorn embryo, resulting\nin the transfer of vocalizations typical of a quail into the Leghorn\nchick (Couly, Coltey, and Le Douarin 1992). Intraspecies mice/mice\nchimeras, the most common of the laboratory-created chimeras, are\ntypically created by genetically engineering embryonic stem cells\nderived from one mouse embryo and inserting them into another mouse\nembryo at the blastocyst stage. The modified embryos are then\nimplanted into surrogate mice and brought to term. If the gametes\n(sperm or eggs) of the resulting chimeric mice are descendants of the\ngenetically engineered cells, they can then be bred with each other to\nproduce nonchimeric offspring carrying the genetic alteration in all\nof their cells.\n\n\nThe early discussion of ethical issues raised by chimeras occurred\nunder the heading of xenotransplantation, the use of non-human animals\nas a source of cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation into\nhumans (Institute of Medicine 1996). The moral argument in favor of\nxenotransplantation was one of beneficence: the shortage of human\norgans available for transplant and the inadequacy of alternatives\nmeant that if non-human animals could serve as a source of organs,\nhundreds of thousands of human lives could be saved or improved each\nyear (ibid., 14). The main ethical problems included the\nhealth risks for the transplant recipient (e.g., a substantial risk of\nhyperacute rejection and graft-versus-host disease), traditional\nanimal ethics issues, concerns about informed consent (complicated by\nempirical uncertainties and the possibility of legally mandated\nlife-long health surveillance), fair allocation of health care\nresources, and the public health issue that xenotransplantation would\nallow viruses to jump the species barrier into humans.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, however, the term\n\u201cchimera\u201d will be restricted to chimeras formed by the\nintroduction of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) or their more\nspecialized derivatives into non-human animals.  Pluripotent cells are\ncapable of turning into any kind of tissue, and stem cells are capable\nof renewing themselves indefinitely. So hPSCs theoretically provide an\nindefinitely renewable source of any kind of human tissue, thus\noffering tremendous potential for basic research, drug development,\nand regenerative medicine (NIH 2001, 5\u201321). The first sources of hPSCs\nwere human embryos, and are thus referred to as human embryonic stem\ncells (hESCs). These were established by James Thomson and colleagues\nat the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1998 (Thomson et al. 1998)\nand their availability has expanded the range of human/non-human\nchimeras that scientists are capable of making. For example:\n\nThe gold standard for ascertaining whether non-human cells are\npluripotent involves injecting them into blastocyst-stage embryos. The\nresulting chimeras are then bred and the offspring examined to see if\nall of their cells are progeny of the inserted cells. If so, then the\ninserted cells were pluripotent, as evidenced by the fact that they\ncould give rise to germ cells and, consequently, to an entire\nindividual. In the case of hESCs, such a procedure would involve the\ncreation of human offspring as a means for testing cell potency, not\nan ethically viable procedure. Instead, the standard method for\nascertaining whether putative hESCs are truly pluripotent is to inject\nthem into postnatal, immune-deficient mice, and see whether they give\nrise to teratomas (tumors that consist of disorganized tissue growth\nof the three embryonic germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and\nectoderm).\nSu-Chun Zhang, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin,\nMadison, discovered how to direct undifferentiated hESCs into neural\nprecursors. To begin exploring whether these cells could serve as a\nsource of cells for possible nervous system repair, he transplanted\nthem into neonatal mice. The cells \u201cwere incorporated into a\nvariety of brain regions, where they differentiated into both neurons\nand astrocytes\u201d (Zhang et al. 2001, 1129).\nUndifferentiated hESCs have been transplanted into\nblastocyst-stage chick embryos to determine whether \u201cthe chick\nembryo could be used as an in vivo system for the study of human ES\ncell differentiation\u201d (Goldstein et al. 2002, 80).\nTransplants of hESCs into blastocyst-stage mouse embryos have been\nperformed to see if the chimeras could provide \u201can accessible\nplatform for studying the emergence of many human cell types; and with\nthe expansion of available hESCs to include genetically diseased\nlines, mouse/human chimeras may allow us to elucidate the bases of\ndisease by examining the behavior of such hESC lines in live animal\nmodels\u201d (James et al. 2006, 100).\nAs mentioned, xenotransplantation was traditionally conceived\nof transplanting animal organs into human beings. Such interspecies\ntransplants, though, impose even greater risks than\nallotransplantation (human-to-human transplants) on the organ\nrecipient because animal organs tend to induce a much more extreme\nimmune response than do human organs. Recent research attempts to\ngenetically engineer the animals to remove the most immunogenic\ncomponents. But some researchers are exploring the possibility of\ngoing further by genetically engineering the animal so that it cannot\nproduce the desired organ on its own. This creates an unoccupied niche\nin the animals. Human pluripotent stem cells are then inserted into\nthe animal to occupy that niche, with the result that the relevant\norgan is made entirely of human cells (Waltz 2017.)\n\n\n\nChimera research inherits the ethical issues associated with\ntraditional animal ethics and, when using hPSCs derived from embryos,\nwith hESC research in general, but one striking feature of the chimera\ndebate is the existence of several advisory bodies that exhibit a\ncautious reaction to certain kinds of chimeric research even though\nthey maintain that non-human animal research and embryo research are\ngenerally permissible. For example, the Human Embryo Research Panel of\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a general endorsement\nof a wide range of embryo research (including hESC research) and\nresearch on non-human animals. Nonetheless, the panel expressed\nconcern about the \u201cextensive mixing\u201d that would occur in\nsome chimera research and unanimously opposed, \u201con ethical and\nscientific grounds, the creation of heterologous, or human-nonhuman\nchimeras, with or without transfer [into a uterus]\u201d (NIH 1994,\n80). Similar statements have been made by the Ethics Advisory Board of\nGeron, the private biotechnology company that financed Thomson\u2019s\noriginal derivations (Geron Ethics Advisory Board 1999, 34), the\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2019s Biotechnology Advisory Committee, which\nprovided guidance to UW on hESC research policy (University of\nWisconsin Biotechnology Advisory Committee 2001), the Committee on\nGuidelines for Human Stem Cell Research created by the National\nAcademies\u2019 Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council\n(National Academy of Sciences 2005), and the International Society for\nStem Cell Research (International Society for Stem Cell Research 2006,\n7). This suggests that chimera research raises some ethical concerns\nthat are distinct from the traditional issues discussed about the use\nof non-human animals or human embryos in research.\n",
