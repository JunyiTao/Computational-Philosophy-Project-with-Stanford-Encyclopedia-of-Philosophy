    "main_text": "Early Modern Foundations || Revitalizing Nature\n2.4 Revitalizing Nature\n\nThe development of new conceptualizations of the relation of organic\nbeings to the history of the world, and the relation of species\npermanence to this history, was achieved in the eighteenth century.\nThis included the breakdown of universal mechanism, the introduction\nof dynamic theories of matter, new theories of embryological\nformation, and a reconceptualization of the relation of time to the\nmaterial world. It also involved the formulation of progressive and\ndevelopmental, rather than \u201cdegenerating\u201d, conceptions of\nthe history of life. The following discussion will selectively examine\naspects of these developments. The reader is referred to major recent\nhistorical syntheses for further development of the more general\nintellectual and scientific context (Zammito 2018; Gaukroger 2010;\nReill 2005; Rudwick 2005).\n\nIn several respects these developments are connected in some way to\nthe introduction of dynamic conceptions of matter that emerged in the\ninterplay between Newtonianism and Leibnizianism in the early decades\nof the eighteenth century, particularly in French discussions (Shank\n2008). As described in the previous section, Newton\u2019s\nintroduction in the Queries to the Opticks of the concept of\nactive microforces that could explain microchemical and electrical\nphenomena opened up this discussion. The other great natural\nphilosophy developed on the Continent by Gottfried Leibniz\n(1646\u20131716) and systematized and expanded into an influential\nsystematic philosophical program by Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754),\nelaborated a more complex theory of matter that distinguished between\nthe properties of phenomenal \u201cmatter\u201d as conceived by\nNewton, and those of a more fundamental active and\nteleologically-directed \u201csubstance\u201d, grounded in force\n(vis). In physics this development played out on the\nContinent in the vis viva controversy, which was concerned\ninitially with the conservation of force in collisions. It was then\nextended to more fundamental metaphysical issues that had a complex\neffect on the life sciences.\n\nIn the life sciences, these issues were manifest in debates over the\nrole of vital powers in the explanation of living properties, as these\nwere developed particularly in French discussions in the complex\ninteractions of Newtonian and Leibnizian-Wolffian natural\nphilosophies. An influential example of this synthesis is\n\u00c9milie Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s (1706\u20131749)\nInstitutions de Physique (first ed. 1740, second ed. 1742).\nThese hybrid Leibnizian- Newtonian syntheses, bringing together\naspects of Newton\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d forces with the monad\nand substance theory of Leibnizianism, were subsequently extended into\ndiscussions of embryology by Pierre de Maupertuis (1698\u20131759),\nand as will be developed in the next section, by Georges-Louis\nLeClerc, Comte de Buffon (1707\u201388) in the 1740s. \n\nIt is in the context of these discussions that we encounter the first\nearly modern systematic speculations connecting naturalistic theories\nof earth history, embryological development, and changes of organic\nspecies in response to external changes of conditions of life. These\nconnections develop directly out of critiques of the preexistence\ntheory of generation by Maupertuis and Buffon, who in different but\nrelated ways reformulated the \u201cmechanistic\u201d epigenetic\nembryology previously advocated by Descartes and Atomist theorists.\nSimilar to these discarded theories (see above, Section 2.2), the\nexistence of equivalent male and female \u201cseeds\u201d was\npostulated, which were then assumed to combine in sexual generation to\nform the embryo. The new eighteenth-century versions supplemented\nthese seventeenth- century accounts with a novel role for dynamic\nconceptions of matter and inherent organizing forces. In the case of\nBuffon, these claims were supported by controversial microscopic\nobservations that presumably refuted the opposing claims made by\nWilliam Harvey a century earlier (Sloan, 1992a). We can conveniently\ndate these developments from the speculations of Pierre de Maupertuis,\nput forth in two treatises, the better known the Physical\nVenus (V\u00e9nus physique) published in 1745\n(Maupertuis 1745 [1966]). To deal with the difficulty of explaining\nhow atomistic seeds derived from the male and female could be formed\ninto the complexity of the embryo, Maupertuis drew upon a version of\nNewtonian attraction inherent in these seeds which also included\nelements of Leibnizian monad theory. In his last formulation of 1751\nhe expanded on this with the claim that the particles themselves were\nendowed with an internal principle that led them to arrange themselves\nto form specific parts of the fetus. Maupertuis\u2019 dynamic\n\u201cepigenesis\u201d incorporated both mechanism and dynamic\nmaterialism (Terrall 2002: chp. 7; Hoffheimer 1982).\n\nThere are at least three ways in which the change in embryological\ntheory instituted by Maupertuis, and subsequently elaborated by\nBuffon, proved to be relevant to the broader question of the\nhistorical transformation of species. First, this new account of the\nembryological origin of the individual organism meant that it actually\nis organized in historical time rather than pre-existing and simply\nunfolding at an opportune moment. Second, it involved a theory of\nmaterial inheritance that explained the passing on of physical traits\nfrom one generation to the next through the transmission of particles\nof matter. Third, the conservation of the identity of the species is\nguaranteed only by the accurate transmission of this material\ninheritance. If this transmission is affected by external\ncircumstances in any way, significant historical change in the lineage\nof ancestor and descendant is possible. These options, opened up by\nMaupertuis\u2019s speculations, were subsequently developed within an\ninstitutional setting by Buffon.\n",
