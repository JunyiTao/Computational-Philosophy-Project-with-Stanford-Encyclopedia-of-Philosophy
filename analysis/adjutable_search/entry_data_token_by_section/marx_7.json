    "main_text": "Alienation and Human Flourishing || Political Emancipation\n2.4 Political Emancipation\n\nIn the text \u201cOn The Jewish Question\u201d (1843) Marx begins to\nmake clear the distance between himself and his radical liberal\ncolleagues among the Young Hegelians; in particular Bruno Bauer. Bauer\nhad recently written against Jewish emancipation, from an atheist\nperspective, arguing that the religion of both Jews and Christians was\na barrier to emancipation. In responding to Bauer, Marx makes one of\nthe most enduring arguments from his early writings, by means of\nintroducing a distinction between political\nemancipation\u2014essentially the grant of liberal rights and\nliberties\u2014and human emancipation. Marx\u2019s reply to Bauer is\nthat political emancipation is perfectly compatible with the continued\nexistence of religion, as the contemporary example of the United\nStates demonstrates. However, pushing matters deeper, in an argument\nreinvented by innumerable critics of liberalism, Marx argues that not\nonly is political emancipation insufficient to bring about human\nemancipation, it is in some sense also a barrier. Liberal rights and\nideas of justice are premised on the idea that each of us needs\nprotection from other human beings who are a threat to our liberty and\nsecurity. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed\nto protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is\nfreedom from interference. What this view overlooks is the\npossibility\u2014for Marx, the fact\u2014that real freedom is to be\nfound positively in our relations with other people. It is to be found\nin human community, not in isolation. Accordingly, insisting on a\nregime of liberal rights encourages us to view each other in ways that\nundermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human\nemancipation. Now we should be clear that Marx does not oppose\npolitical emancipation, for he sees that liberalism is a great\nimprovement on the systems of feudalism and religious prejudice and\ndiscrimination which existed in the Germany of his day. Nevertheless,\nsuch politically emancipated liberalism must be transcended on the\nroute to genuine human emancipation. Unfortunately, Marx never tells\nus what human emancipation is, although it is clear that it is closely\nrelated to the ideas of non-alienated labour and meaningful\ncommunity.\n",
