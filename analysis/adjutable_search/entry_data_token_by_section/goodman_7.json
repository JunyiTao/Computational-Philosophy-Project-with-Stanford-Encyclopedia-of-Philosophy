    "main_text": "The Structure of Appearance || The Critique of Carnap\u2019s Aufbau\n4.2 The Critique of Carnap\u2019s Aufbau\nGoodman\u2019s predecessor in studying a constitutional system by the\nmeans of modern formal logic is, as we already said, Rudolf Carnap,\nwho follows a very similar project as Goodman in his Der logische\nAufbau der Welt (Carnap 1928). In this book Carnap investigates\nthe example of a world built up from primitive temporal parts of the\ntotality of experiences of a subject (the so-called \u201celementary\nexperiences\u201d or just \u201cerlebs\u201d) and thus faces the\nproblem of abstraction: how can qualities, properties and their\nobjects in the world be abstracted from our phenomenal\nexperiences.\nCarnap tries to show that by using the method of\n\u201cquasi-analysis\u201d all the structure can be retained from\nthe basis if the \u201cerlebs\u201d are ordered by a simple relation\nof part-similarity. Very roughly, the idea is that, although the\nindividual temporal slices of our totality of experience are not\nstructured (and thus have no parts), we can, via quasi-analysis, get\nto their quasi-parts, the \u201cqualities\u201d they share with\nother time-slices with which they are part-similar. Of course, time\nslices of the totality of our experiences can be part-similar with\neach other in a variety of ways. Perhaps two slices are similar with\nrespect to what is in our visual field at the time in question, or\nthey are similar with respect to what we hear or smell. However, since\nthe time-slices are primitives in the system, we cannot yet even talk\nabout these respects or ways in which the slices should be similar in\norder to, for example, be considered experiences of the same\ncolor. Carnap\u2019s ingenious idea is to group exactly those erlebs\ntogether that are mutually part-similar, thereby grouping exactly\nthose that share (pre-theoretically speaking) a property. For simple\ncases the quasi-analysis seems to give exactly the right\nresults. Consider the following group of erlebs that,\npre-theoretically have different colors.\n\n\nFigure 1a.\n\nHowever, we do not yet know that there are such things as\ncolors. In fact the only thing we know about the erlebs\n(A\u2013F) is that they are part similar as displayed\nin the following graph (where part-similarity between erlebs is\nindicated by a line):\n\n\nFigure 1b.\n\n\n\nIf we take the graph and now group exactly those erlebs together\nthat are mutually part-similar, we get the following sets:\n\n\\[\n\\{A, B, C, F\\}, \\{A, E, F\\}, \\{C, D, F\\}\n\\]\n\nBut, of course, these sets correspond exactly to the extensions of\nthe colors in our example (viz. black, green, and red). Thus, by\nknowing about the part-similarity between erlebs alone, we seem to be\nable to reconstruct their properties with the method of\nquasi-analysis.\nGoodman observes, however, that in unfavorable circumstances\nquasi-analysis will lead to the wrong results. Consider the following\nsituation:\n\n\nFigure 2a.\n\nThis corresponds to the following graph:\n\n\nFigure 2b.\n\nIf we use Carnap\u2019s rule for quasi-analysis, we will obtain all\ncolor classes except \\(\\{A, E, F\\}\\), the color class for\n\u201cgreen\u201d, because green only occurs in \u201cconstant\ncompanionship\u201d with the color \u201cblack\u201d. Goodman calls\nthis the \u201cconstant companionship difficulty\u201d.\nA second problem can be illustrated with the following example of\nerlebs:\n\n\nFigure 3a.\n\nThis corresponds to this graph:\n\n\nFigure 3b.\n\nBut here \\(\\{A,C,F\\}\\) should be a color class resulting from\nquasi-analysis, although \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(F\\) have in fact\nno color in common.  Goodman calls this problem \u201cthe difficulty\nof imperfect community\u201d. It is controversial to what extent\nthese problems are devastating for Carnap\u2019s project, but Goodman\nconsidered them to be serious.\n",
