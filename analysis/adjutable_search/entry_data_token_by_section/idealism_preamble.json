    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry discusses philosophical idealism as a movement chiefly in\nthe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, although anticipated by\ncertain aspects of seventeenth century philosophy and continuing into\nthe twentieth century. It revises the standard distinction between\nepistemological idealism, the view that the contents of human\nknowledge are ineluctably determined by the structure of human\nthought, and ontological idealism, the view that epistemological\nidealism delivers truth because reality itself is a form of thought\nand human thought participates in it, in favor of a distinction\nearlier suggested by A.C. Ewing, between epistemological and\nmetaphysical arguments for idealism as itself a metaphysical position.\nAfter discussing precursors, the entry focuses on the\neighteenth-century versions of idealism due to Berkeley, Hume, and\nKant, the nineteenth-century movements of German idealism and\nsubsequently British and American idealism, and then concludes with an\nexamination of the attack upon idealism by Moore and Russell and the\nlate defense of idealism by Brand Blanshard. \n\nWith the possible exception of the introduction (Section 1), each of\nthe sections below can be read independently and readers are welcome\nto focus on the section(s) of most interest.\n",
