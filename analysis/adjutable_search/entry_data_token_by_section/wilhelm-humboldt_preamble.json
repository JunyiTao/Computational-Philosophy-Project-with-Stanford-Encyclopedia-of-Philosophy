    "main_text": "\n\nWilhelm (Friedrich Wilhelm Christian Karl Ferdinand) von Humboldt,\nGerman man of letters extraordinary, close friend of the poets Goethe\nand Schiller, whose life\u2019s work encompasses the areas of philosophy,\nliterature, linguistics, anthropology, education, and political\nthought as well statesmanship was born in Potsdam on June 22, 1767 and\ndied at Tegel near Berlin on April 8, 1835. Although there has always\nbeen strong interest in Humboldt expressed by political and cultural\nhistorians and educationists in Germany, it is only in recent decades\nthat his contributions to the formation of modern linguistics, to\nsemiotics, hermeneutics and philosophy of language have given rise to\nrenewed attention to his pioneering achievements in these areas, even\nthough much of his work in linguistics has remained unknown or\nunexplored until recently. Yet numerous linguists beginning with Pott\nand Steinthal in Germany and the American Brinton in the nineteenth\ncentury to Boas, Sapir, B\u00fchler, Weisgerber, and Chomsky in the\ntwentieth century derived or claimed to have derived important\ninsights from Humboldt. But their interest in Humboldt was partial at\nbest and limited to those aspects of his work that could be utilized\nto reinforce or to legitimize their own projects and methodologies. It\nis quite misleading to associate the term \u201cHumboldtian\nlinguistics\u201d or \u201cHumboldtian philosophy of language\u201d\nwith any one specific direction, for example with the Whorfian thesis\nof \u201clinguistic relativity\u201d or with Chomsky\u2019s opposite\nnotion of a universalist \u201cgenerative grammar\u201d because\nthese tend to ignore other equally or more important dimensions of\nHumboldt\u2019s work. After his death in 1835 his linguistic work was\neffectively disregarded by mainstream linguists in Germany whose\nprimary interest was focused on the Indo-European language group. Thus\na prominent figure like Franz Bopp would maintain that the languages\nof the South Pacific represented but decayed forms of Sanskrit despite\nthe fact that Humboldt had already thoroughly disproved this opinion\nin his Kavi Work and demonstrated that these languages constituted\nwhat is called today the Austronesian language group (Mueller-Vollmer\n1991). Even the linguist Heyman Steinthal, who published in 1884 a two\nvolume edition of Humboldt\u2019s writings entitled Die\nSprachphilosophischen Werke Wilhelm\u2019s von Humboldt (Humboldt\u2019s\nworks in philosophy of language) (see \u201cWorks\u201d,\nbibliography), in his introduction and commentaries criticises\nHumboldt from a reductionist psychologistic position and neither here\nor anywhere in his other writings made a serious attempt to discuss\nHumboldt\u2019s own arguments and to investigate his actual philosophical\nposition. In France, on the other hand, we find throughout the\nnineteenth century a comparatively sustained interest in Humboldt\nthat was confined chiefly to his work in the Asian languages and to\nhis Basque studies. As a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nAsiatique in Paris he published a number of articles in the\nsociety\u2019s official journal, the Journal Asiatique (for a list\nof these articles, see B\u00f6sch 2006, p. 234) and the latter in turn\ncarried reviews of some of his writings. It has to be noted that this\nFrench reception resulted largely from the personal contacts and\nscholarly exchanges that he maintained with a number of prominent\nFrench linguists such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, Jean-Pierre\nAbel-R\u00e9musat, Eug\u00e8ne Jacquet, and Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf.\nYet Humboldt\u2019s French reception, while including some of his important\nlinguistic studies, all but omitted their philosophical concerns and\nunderlying principles. Typical is the review of Humboldt\u2019s\ngroundbreaking treatise from 1827, \u201cOn the Dual\u201d that\nappeared in the Nouvelle Revue Germanique, I: 378\u2013381\n(1829), where the reviewer blended out entirely the philosophical\nintent and key argument of the piece (Ibid. 105/6) and thus distorted\nbeyond recognition Humboldt\u2019s integration of linguistic research and\nphilosophy of language, which lies at the heart of his linguistic\nenterprise. It is only in the late twentieth century that the\nphilosopher of language and linguist Humboldt has been discovered in\nFrance by men like Henri Meschonic, Jean Rousseau or Denis Thouard\n(For their publications see, B\u00f6sch 2006, pp. 239f, 243f, and\n247f). Surprisingly, Humboldt\u2019s name has been notoriously absent in\nthe extensive debates prompted by Jacques Derrida and his\nGrammatology concerning the role of writing (\u00e9criture)\nfor an understanding of language and culture and its alleged neglect\nin the Western tradition because of its inherent phonocentrism. For\nHumboldt had in effect produced, on the basis of his extensive study\nof the world\u2019s different writing systems past and present, a\ncomprehensive theory of writing that does not fit into the rubrics of\nphonocentrism or eurocentrism. Writing constituted in his view an\nessential part of language, the material embodiment of the specific\nformative principle a language employs to construct meaning rather\nthan being the mere representational mirror of speech. For him, the\ndevelopment of language and writing were mutually dependent on each\nother (On this issue see the extensive and groundbreaking work by\nMessling 2008).\n\nThere was an early presence of Humboldtian ideas in American\nlinguistics and ethnology dating back to the early nineteenth\ncentury in which Humboldt himself had played an active role. Its\nbeginning is marked by Stephen S. Duponceau\u2019s (1760\u20131844)\nprogrammatic report to the American Philosophical Society in\nPhiladelphia in 1819 on the study the American Indian languages in the\n\u201cTransactions of the historical and literary committee of the\nAmerican Philosophical Society\u201d, the founding document of\nAmerican linguistics, with its reference to Humboldt (Transactions\nof the historical and literary committee of the American Philosophical\nSociety, vol. 1, Philadelphia, 1819) and the ensuing\ncorrespondence between the two men. There is in addition Humboldt\u2019s\nimportant correspondence with the second founder of American\nlinguistics, John Pickering (1777\u20131846) who wrote a lengthy\narticle on the American Indian languages for Francis Lieber\u2019s\nEncyclopedia Americana where specific reference is made to\nHumboldt\u2019s work (see Pickering 1831). Francis Lieber\n(1798\u20131872), the creator and editor of the Encyclopedia\nAmericana, besides corresponding with the German linguist,\nfollowed Humboldtian principles or what he understood of them in his\nown linguistic work on the American languages (see for example\nLieber\u2019s \u201cThe Plan of Thought in American Languages\u201d, in\nH. R. Schoolcraf\u2019s History and Statistics of the Indian Tribes of\nthe United State, vol. ii, 346\u2013349, Washington, 1853). The\nmost prominent American ethnologist and linguist of the second half of\nthe nineteenth century, Daniel G. Brinton (1837\u20131899) was\nwell acquainted with Humboldt\u2019s work on the American Indian tongues,\nas far as it was known then. He viewed his own researches as following\nthe path that Humboldt had first laid out. There are references to\nHumboldt throughout his work, he translated an unpublished treatise of\nhis \u201cOn the American Verb System\u201d and regarded him as\nfounder of \u201cthe Philosophy of Language\u201d (Brinton 1890, p.\n332.). Yet what he and his followers understood by this term was\nconfined largely to the methodological principles that governed\nHumboldt\u2019s typological and comparative studies and excluded essential\ndimensions and the actual philosophical concerns expressed in his\nwritings. \n\nA similar process of partial appropriation has been characteristic\nalso of the philosophers who paid serious attention to Humboldt\u2019s\nviews, such as Ernst Cassirer (1923\u201329), Martin Heidegger (1927,\n1959), and more recently Bruno Liebrucks (1965), Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1960, 1965, 1972), and J\u00fcrgen Habermas (1985, 1988, 1991). It is\nonly in the last decades that Humboldt\u2019s philosophical and linguistic\nwritings have become a focal point of attention in their own right.\nLinguists of various orientations, philosophers, historians and\nliterary scholars of different nationalities alike have examined\nHumboldt\u2019s philosophy and linguistic ideas by placing them into a\nvariety of different contexts.\n",
