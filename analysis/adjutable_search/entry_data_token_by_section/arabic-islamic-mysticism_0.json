    "main_text": "Neoplatonism and Sufism\n1. Neoplatonism and Sufism\n\nFollowing the early theological schools of thought in Islam, among\nwhich were the determinists (Qadarites), the eschatologists\n(Murj\u2018aites and Wa\u2018idites) and the faith\nbased theologians (Ash\u2018arites), there came the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition and its many different schools of thought.\nEven though Al-Kind\u012b is regarded to be the first Muslim\nphilosopher, the full impact of Hellenic thought on Islamic philosophy\nis best seen in the philosophical edifice of Ab\u016b Nasr\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (10th CE) Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b,\nwho is considered to be the father of logic in the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition, is also the first to have embraced\nNeoplatonism, albeit in a limited sense. It was his paradigm that\npaved the way for mysticism to enter Islamic philosophy.\n\nNeoplatonism, which has remained one of the salient features of\nIslamic philosophy, has performed two functions: the intellectual and\nthe practical, both of which have become an integral part of living a\nphilosophical life. Philosophically, Neoplatonism provides answers to\nmost major questions within the context of Islam, such as how\nmultiplicity came from unity and how corporality emanated from an\nincorporeal God, as well as explaining the ascending and descending\norder of beings.\n\nMysticism in Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b manifests itself in two ways,\nphilosophical and practical. Philosophically, as is evident in The\nLetter Concerning the Intellect (Ris\u0101lah\nfi\u2019l-\u2018aql), his interpretation of the concept of the\nfour intellects paved the road for his successor Avicenna (Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101) (981\u20131037 CE), who made full use of\nNeoplatonism. Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b tries in his writings not only\nto reconcile the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, with Plato seen as\nsomewhat of a mystical figure, but also, in his discussions of\npolitical philosophy, he replaced Plato\u2019s philosopher-king with\nan Imam whose understanding of truth is intuitive, who knows not only\ntheoretical virtues but also the practical ones. However, even though\nhis musical compositions are sung among some Sufi orders in Turkey and\nthe Indo-Pakistani continent and one can see the influence of Sufism\nin his Bezels of Wisdom (Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63\nal-h\u0323ikam), reports concerning him having been a practicing\nSufi are quite nebulous.\n\nAs to the master of the Peripatetics, Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101)\nhimself, the consensus of scholars is that Avicenna was a rationalist\nwho embraced certain concepts from Plato, Aristotle and Neoplatonism\nand that the salient feature of his philosophical writings are\ndiscursive in nature. From here on, there are generally two distinct\ninterpretations of Avicennan philosophy: Those who see him only as a\nrationalist who had nothing to do with mysticism and those who argue\nthat later Avicenna had embraced mysticism as is reflected in some of\nhis later works.\n\nMost Western scholars of Avicenna who see him only as a rationalist,\nsimilar to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Averroes, (Gutas 2006, Adamson\n2013) primarily rely on his discursive and rationalistic writings.\nMany Muslim philosophers in particular Iranian scholars of Avicenna\nhave a more inclusive reading of his writings and tend to agree that\nin the later period of his life, Avicenna developed an interest in\nmysticism. (Nasr & Leaman 1996, Inati 1996).\n\nFor Avicenna, similar to many other Muslim philosophers, the ultimate\nphilosophical endeavor was to unveil the mystery of creation in\nparticular; how Divine unity became the multiplicity of the world of\nexistents. To resolve this riddle, Avicenna adopts the Neoplatonic\nscheme of emanation which has also been used not only by Sufis and\nIslamic gnostics to explain the spiritual journey of man towards God\nbut also, by almost all philosopher-mystics from Suhraward\u012b and\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 to Sabziw\u0101r\u012b and\n\u1e6cab\u0101\u1e6dab\u0101\u2019\u012b.\n\nAvicenna was not a practicing Sufi with any known affiliation to a\nSufi order. In fact, Avicenna\u2019s meeting with the great Sufi\nmaster Ab\u016b Sa\u2018\u012bd Abu\u2019l-Khayr (d. 1049 CE) and\nthe presence of an \u201coriental philosophy\u201d\n(al-\u1e25ikmat al-mashraqiyyah) in his writing in all\nlikelihood are apocryphal. However, the presence of mystical elements\nin some of his later works is held by some to be undeniable\n(Aminrazavi 2003). For instance, in the ninth chapter of his\nphilosophical masterpiece Remarks and Treatments\n(al-Ish\u0101r\u0101t wa\u2019l-tanbih\u0101t), in a section\nentitled On the Stations of Knowers (F\u012b maq\u0101m\u0101t\nal-\u2018\u0101rif\u012bn), Avicenna appears to offers an\nexplanation of the Sufi doctrine and openly to defend the gnostic and\nSufi method of attaining truth. While the authorship of some of his\nPersian writings are subject to debate, in some of his allegorical\nwritings, such as Treatise on Ascendance (Mi\u2018r\u0101j\nn\u0101mah), Treatise on Birds (Ris\u0101lat al-\u1e6da\u012br),\nSalm\u0101n and Abs\u0101l, Son of the Living Awake (\u1e24ayy\nibn Yaqz\u0323\u0101n) and Treatise on Love (Ris\u0101lah\nfi\u2019l-\u2018ishq) not to mention his famous poem Ode of\nthe Soul (al-Qa\u1e63idah al-\u2018ayniyyah), the presence of\nSufi and gnostic elements are vividly apparent to those who follow\nthis interpretation.\n\nWith Avicenna, who represents the pinnacle of rationalistic philosophy\nin Persia, came two other intellectual trends. On the one side there\nwas the towering figure of Ab\u016b \u1e24\u0101mid\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b, who rejected philosophy altogether and became the\nexponent of Sufism alone. On the other side, there arose\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012bs philosophy, which incorporated Sufi and\nHermetico-Pythagorean ideas within a philosophical context.\n\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b, an orthodox jurist and a major exponent of faith\nbased theology (Ash\u2018arite) having studied philosophy,\nthought discursive reasoning stood on a solid ground but soon turned\nagainst philosophy, offering a devastating critique of reason in his\nThe Incoherence of Philosophers (Tah\u0101fut\nal-fal\u0101sifah). Having been disillusioned with intellectual\nsciences, he practiced asceticism for a number of years in seclusion\nand finally found his answers in the Sufi tradition. The spiritual\njourney of Ghazz\u0101l\u012b from an orthodox jurist to a Sufi is one\nof the most remarkable accounts of the transformation of a Muslim sage\nwho turned from the outward to the inner life of Islam and found\nSufism to be the only path that leads to truth. He spent the later\npart of his life teaching, writing and practicing Sufism.\n\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b is one of the few mystics whose brand of Sufism\nembraces religious orthodoxy, a gnostic intellectual framework, and\nthe more practical and ascetic dimension of the spiritual path.\nContrary to the antinomian Sufis, who violated the Islamic law\n(Shari\u2018ah) and the more relaxed attitude of some of the\nother Sufis, Ghazz\u0101l\u012b was an austere and ardent observer of\nIslamic law.\n\nHe wrote extensively on mysticism, arguing it to be the only right\npath to truth. A notable piece among his writings on mysticism is\nThe Niche of Light (Mishk\u0101t al-anw\u0101r), a\nsignificant work of an illuminationist nature and one that influenced\nthe formation of the doctrine of illumination (ishr\u0101q)\nby Suhraward\u012b (Aminrazavi 1996). Also, parts of his Magnum Opus,\nRevival of Religious Sciences (I\u1e25y\u0101\u2019\nal-\u2018ul\u016bm al-d\u012bn\u012b), such as book thirty-five\nof the Ih\u0323y\u0101\u2019: The Book of Faith in Divine Unity\nand Trust in Divine Providence, are essentially devoted to an\nexplication of the Sufi doctrine. He also has written numerous shorter\ncommentaries on the spiritual significance of fasting, praying,\ninvocation of divine names and attributes, and spiritual music as\ninstruments of the catharsis of the soul.\n",
