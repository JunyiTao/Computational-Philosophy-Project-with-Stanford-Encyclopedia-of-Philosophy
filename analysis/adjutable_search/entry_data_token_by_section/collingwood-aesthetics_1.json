    "main_text": "Art as Craft, Magic, Representation and Amusement || Art as Craft\n1.1 Art as Craft\n\nThe first of these things that is easily confused with art proper has\nthe recommendation of having been espoused by Plato and Aristotle.\nThis is the \u2018technical\u2019 theory of art, or the theory that\nart is craft (from the Greek word \u2018techn\u00ea\u2019), by\nwhich we mean a fully worked out theory of crafts such as watchmaking,\njoinery, carpentry and so on. In fact, the theory of craft, along with\nthe thesis that art is not craft, suffices to show that art proper is\na distinct activity from the other three things, by showing that they\nare essentially crafts.\n\nThe term \u2018craft\u2019 refers to activities which typically\nexemplify the following six characteristics. None is individually\nnecessary, but the less of them that an activity exemplifies, the less\nsense there is in calling it a craft: (1) The applicability of a\ndistinction amongst actions as means and actions as ends; a baker, for\nexample, whips the egg whites in course of mixing the batter, for the\neventual end of baking a cake. (2) A distinction between planning and\nexecution; a carpenter, for example, may draw up a plan for a table,\nand then in a separate action or set of actions construct a table. (3)\nIn planning, ends precede means in that the latter are chosen for the\nsake of the former, but in execution the means precede the end. (4) We\ncan distinguish between raw material and finished product. (5) A\ndistinction can be drawn been form and matter. (6) Crafts stand in\nthree sorts of hierarchy: (a) The raw material of one craft is the\nfinished product of another; for example the sawmill produces plywood,\nwhich is in turn the raw material for builders. (b) One craft has as\nits end product the tools which are employed as means in another. (c)\nSome trades work in concert to bring about the finished product; for\nexample, the manufacture of a computer may involve separable\nmanufacture of the chip, the hard disc, the monitor and so on, so that\nthe final assembly is \u2018only the bringing together of these\nparts\u2019.\n\nThe point is not that works of art never display any of these\nfeatures; the point is that some works of art involve none of them,\nwithout its detracting from their status as art. Therefore the essence\nof art cannot have to do with any features correctly treated by a\ntheory of craft. A pure case might be the poet for whom the poem\nsimply comes to mind, unbidden, without its being written down or even\nsaid aloud. There is no distinction to be drawn between planning and\nexecution in such a case, and none between actions as means and\nactions as ends. (If the poet had in mind something analogous to a\nblueprint for the poem, he would already have composed it.)\n\nThat takes care of (1)\u2013(3), and (6) (a)\u2013(c). What of (4)?\nIt might be tempting to think of the words as the raw material, the\npoem as the finished product. But T. S. Eliot for example did not\nchoose the words needed for The Wasteland and then proceed to\narrange them into the poem. The poet can, however, be conceived as\n\u2018converting emotions into poems\u2019; but this is \u2018a\nvery different kind of thing\u2019 from, say, the pasta maker\u2019s\nconversion of flour into spaghetti. Collingwood simply leaves this\npoint hanging, because it would require his own positive account of\nart as expression to explain it; that will come later. (He also\nneglects the possibility that the raw material of the poet is simply\nthe language as a whole.)\n\nFinally, the distinction between form and matter as it applies to art\nis not the sort required by (5). That distinction requires that the\nself-same matter be capable of having different forms placed upon it;\nif we cannot identify the matter in the first place, then the\ndistinction cannot get a grip.\n\nIt bears repeating that the claim is not that no works of art have any\ncraft-like features; it simply that any definition of art in terms of\nthose features would exclude some unimpeachable works of art (29). Or\nrather, success in being craft is strictly immaterial to its being\nart; no craft-features make an object into a work of art.\nCollingwood is well aware that for example an opera requires a great\ndeal of planning, technique, raw materials, and so on. And because of\nthis, he is well aware that the craft-theory is widely if implicitly\nheld, and devotes a lively excursus to its modern manifestation,\nnamely \u2018Art as a Psychological Stimulus\u2019. This is the\naccount of art whereby it is the craft (or \u2018technique\u2019) of\nmanipulating certain objects (paint, sound, words and on) so as to\nbring about psychological states in the audience, which in turn are\nknown, or least knowable, in advance. But this is to assimilate works\nof art to mere means; Collingwood is quite serious in his denial of\nthis. The artist is not \u2018a purveyor of drugs\u2019 (34).\n",
