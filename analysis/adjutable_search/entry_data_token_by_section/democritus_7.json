    "main_text": "Ethics\n8. Anthropology\n\nAlthough the evidence is not certain, Democritus may be the originator\nof an ancient theory about the historical development of human\ncommunities. In contrast to the Hesiodic view that the human past\nincluded a golden age from which the present day is a decline, an\nalternative tradition that may derive from Democritus suggests that\nhuman life was originally like that of animals; it describes the\ngradual development of human communities for purposes of mutual aid,\nthe origin of language, crafts and agriculture. Although the text in\nquestion does not mention Democritus by name, he is the most plausible\nsource (Cole 1967; Cartledge 1997).\n\nIf Democritus is the source for this theory, it suggests that he took\nseriously the need to account for the origin of all aspects of the\nworld of our experience. Human institutions could not be assumed to be\npermanent features or divine gifts. The explanations offered suggest\nthat human culture developed as a response to necessity and the\nhardships of our environment. It has been suggested that the sheer\ninfinite size of the atomist universe and thus the number of possible\ncombinations and arrangements that would occur by chance alone are\nimportant in the development of an account that can show how human\ninstitutions arise without assuming teleological or theological\norigins (Cole 1967). Although here, as on other questions, the\nevidence is less than certain, it is plausible that Democritus\ndeveloped a powerful and consistent explanation of much of the natural\nworld from a very few fundamentals.\n\nFor the reception and subsequent history of Democritean atomism, see\nthe related entry on ancient atomism.\n",
