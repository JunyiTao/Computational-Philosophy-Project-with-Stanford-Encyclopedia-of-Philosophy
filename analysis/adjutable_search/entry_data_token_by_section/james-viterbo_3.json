    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Divine Ideas\n2.3 Divine Ideas\n\nThe scholastics held that because God is the creative cause of all\nnatural beings, he must possess the ideas corresponding to each of his\ncreatures. But because God is eternal and is not subject to change,\nthe ideas must be eternally present in him, although creatures exist\nfor only a finite period of time. This doctrine of course raised many\ndifficulties, which each author addressed with varying degrees of\nsuccess. One difficulty had to do with reconciling the multiplicity of\nideas with God\u2019s unity: since there are many species of being,\nthere must be a corresponding number of ideas; but God is one and,\nhence, cannot contain any multiplicity. Another, directly related,\ndifficulty had to do with the ontological status of ideas: do ideas\nhave any reality apart from God? If one denied them any kind of\nreality, it was hard to see how they could function as exemplar causes\nof things; but to assign too much reality to them was to run the risk\nof introducing multiplicity in God and undermining the ex\nnihilo character of creation.\u00a0\n\nOne influential solution to these difficulties was provided by Thomas\nAquinas, who argued that divine ideas are nothing else but the diverse\nways in which God\u2019s essence is capable of being imitated, so\nthat God knows the ideas of things by knowing his essence. Ideas are\nnot distinct from God\u2019s essence, though they are distinct from\nthe essences of the things God creates (De veritate, q. 2, a.\n3).\n\nOne can discern two answers to the problem of divine ideas in the\nworks of James of Viterbo. At an early stage of his career, in the\nAbbreviatio in Sententiarum Aegidii\nRomani\u00ad\u2014assuming one accepts, as seems reasonable, the\nearly dating suggested by Ypma (1975)\u2014James defends a position\nthat is almost identical to that of Thomas Aquinas (Giustiniani 1979).\nIn his Quodlibeta, however, he defends a position that is\ncloser to that of Henry of Ghent. In the following I will sketch\nJames\u2019 position in the Quodlibeta as it provides the\nmost mature statement of his views. For detailed discussions, see\nGossiaux (2007) and C\u00f4t\u00e9 (2018). \n\nAlthough James agreed with the notion that ideas are to be viewed as\nthe differing ways in which God can be imitated, he did not think that\none could make sense of the claim that God knows other things by\ncognizing his own essence unless one supposed that the essences of\nthose things preexist in some way (aliquo modo) in God.\nJames\u2019 solution is to distinguish two ways in which ideas are in\nGod\u2019s intellect. They are in God\u2019s intellect, firstly, as\nidentical with it, and, secondly, as distinct from it. The first mode\nof being is necessary as a means of acknowledging God\u2019s unity;\nbut the second mode of being is just as necessary, for, as James puts\nit (Quodl. I, q. 5, p. 64, 65\u201367), \u201cif God knows\ncreatures before they exist, even insofar as they are other than him\nand distinct (from him), that which he knows is a cognized object,\nwhich must needs be something; for that which nowise exists and is\nabsolutely nothing cannot be understood.\u201d\u00a0 But James also\nthinks that the necessity of positing distinct ideas in God follows\nfrom a consideration of God\u2019s essence. God enjoys the highest\ndegree of nobility and goodness. His mode of knowledge must be\ncommensurate with his nature. But according to Proclus, an author\nJames is quite fond of quoting, the highest form of knowledge is\nknowledge through a thing\u2019s cause. That means that God knows\nthings through his own essence. More precisely, he knows things by\nknowing his essence as the cause of those things, knowledge that is\ndistinct in James\u2019s view from God\u2019s mere knowledge of\nhimself.\n\nAlthough James\u2019 insistence on the distinctness of ideas with\nrespect to God\u2019s essence is reminiscent of Henry of\nGhent\u2019s teaching, it is important to note, as has been stressed\nby M. Gossiaux (2007), that James does not conceive of this\ndistinctness as Henry does. For Henry, ideas possess \u201cbeing of\nessence\u201d (esse essentiae); James, by contrast, while\nreferring to divine ideas as things (res), is careful to add\nthat they are not things \u201cin the absolute sense but only in a\nqualified sense,\u201d viz., as cognized objects (Quodl. I,\nq. 5, p. 63, 60). Thus, divine ideas for James possess a lesser degree\nof distinction from God\u2019s essence than do Henry of\nGhent\u2019s. Nevertheless, because James did consider ideas to be\ndistinct in some sense from God, his position would be viewed by some\nlater authors\u2014e.g., William of Alnwick\u2014as compromising\ndivine unity.
