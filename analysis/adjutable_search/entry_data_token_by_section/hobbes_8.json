    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion\n5. Philosophy of Religion\n\nHobbes\u2019s views about religion have been disputed at great\nlength, and a wide range of positions have been attributed to him,\nfrom atheism to orthodox Christianity. This section focuses on two\ncentral questions: whether Hobbes believes in the existence of God,\nand whether he thinks there can be knowledge from revelation. Some\nimportant aspects of Hobbes\u2019s approach to religion are left\naside. These include religion\u2019s role in politics (Lloyd 1992),\nand the question of whether God plays some fundamental role in\nHobbes\u2019s ethical system (see Warrender 1957 and Martinich 1992,\nbut also Nagel 1959 and Darwall 1994).\n\nHobbes at one point rules a good deal of religious discussion out of\nphilosophy, because its topics are not susceptible to the full\ndetailed causal explanation that is required for scientia,\nthe best sort of knowledge. \u201cThus philosophy excludes from\nitself theology, as I call the doctrine about the nature and\nattributes of the eternal, ungenerable, and incomprehensible God, and\nin whom no composition and no division can be established and no\ngeneration can be understood\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.8). Also excluded\nare discussion of angels, of revelation, and of the proper worship of\nGod. But despite these not being, strictly speaking, philosophy,\nHobbes does in fact have a good deal to say about them, most notably\nin Leviathan. Things outside philosophy (in its strict sense)\nmay not be amenable to thorough causal explanation in terms of the\nmotions of bodies, but they may well still be within the limits of\nrational discussion.\n\nMany people have called Hobbes an atheist, both during his lifetime\nand more recently. However, the word \u2018atheist\u2019 did not\nmean the same thing in the seventeenth century as it means now. Thus\nwhen Mintz (1962), in a study of Hobbes\u2019s critics that often\nmentions atheism, summarizes the reasons those critics gave for\ncalling Hobbes an atheist, he lists the views\n\n\nthat the universe is body, that God is part of the world and therefore\nbody, that the Pentateuch and many other books of Scripture are\nredactions or compilations from earlier sources, that the members of\nthe Trinity are Moses, Jesus, and the Apostles, that few if any\nmiracles can be credited after the Testamental period, that no persons\ndeserve the name of \u2018martyr\u2019 expect those who witnessed\nthe ascension of Christ, that witchcraft is a myth and heaven a\ndelusion, that religion is in fact so muddled with superstition as to\nbe in many vital places indistinguishable from it, [and] that the\nChurch, both in its government and its doctrine, must submit to the\ndictates of Leviathan, the supreme civil authority (Mintz 1962,\n45).\n\n\nThus, many of Hobbes\u2019s critics in the seventeenth century,\nincluding those who vehemently attacked his religious views, still\nthought he believed in the existence of God. They thought, however,\nthat he was a rather dubious sort of Christian. Other critics,\nhowever, have thought that Hobbes in fact denied the existence of God.\nThis might seem a curious allegation, for Hobbes often talks about God\nas existing. Certainly, to read Hobbes in this way requires one to\ntake some of his statements at something other than face value.\n\nIn the Elements of Law Hobbes offers a cosmological argument\nfor the existence of God (Hobbes 1640, 11.2). However, he argues, the\nonly thing we can know about God is that he, \u201cfirst cause of all\ncauses\u201d, exists. Our knowledge is limited in this way because\nour thoughts about God are limited: \u201cwe can have no conception\nor image of the Deity\u201d. So when we seem to attribute features to\nGod, we cannot literally be describing God (Hobbes 1640, 11.3).\nWe\u2019re either expressing our inability, as when we call God\nincomprehensible, or we\u2019re expressing our reverence, as when we\ncall God omniscient and just. The same indeed is going on when we call\nGod a spirit: this is not \u201ca name of anything we\nconceive\u201d, but again a \u201csignification of our\nreverence\u201d (Hobbes 1640, 11.3).\n\nThose three views \u2014 support for a cosmological argument, the\nbelief that God is inconceivable by us, and the interpretation of\napparent descriptions of God as not really descriptions \u2014 appear\nto recur in Leviathan (Hobbes 1651, 11.25, 12.6\u20139).\nHowever, in later work, such as the appendix to the 1668 Latin edition\nof Leviathan, Hobbes proposes a different view. The older\nHobbes thought that we could know God to have at least one feature,\nnamely extension. In his Answer to Bishop Bramhall, Hobbes\ndescribes God as a \u201ccorporeal spirit\u201d (Hobbes 1662,\n4.306). By this he means at least that God is extended. Indeed, Hobbes\nseems to think of God as a sort of extended thing that\u2019s mixed\nthrough the rest of the world, not being in every individual place in\nthe world, but able to affect all the things in the world (Hobbes\n1662, 4.306\u201313, especially 4.309\u201310).\n\nWhatever one thinks of the orthodoxy of Hobbes\u2019s earlier views\n\u2014 and one might take the holder of those views just to be a very\nserious believer in the rather orthodox view that God is\nincomprehensible \u2014 this later view that God is corporeal is\nstrange indeed. However, Hobbes does seem in his Answer to Bishop\nBramhall and the Appendix to the Latin edition of\nLeviathan to believe this strange view sincerely. Indeed, he\ngoes to some pains to defend this as an acceptable version of\nChristianity. Whether or not one believes that, this is still on the\nsurface an odd theism rather than atheism.\n\nEven if Hobbes is some sort of theist, he\u2019s a theist who is\nsceptical about many widely held religious views. This is notable to\nsome extent in his critical reading of biblical texts, which was not\nat all a standard approach at the time. Indeed, Hobbes and Spinoza\noften get a good deal of credit for developing this approach.\nIt\u2019s notable too in his treatment of matters related to\nrevelation.\n\nIn chapter 2 of Leviathan Hobbes comes to these topics at a\nslightly surprising point. In the course of discussing the workings of\nimagination, he talks naturally enough about dreams. Emphasizing the\noccasional difficulty of distinguishing dreams from waking life, he\nturns to talk of visions. Dreams had in stressful circumstances, when\none sleeps briefly, are sometimes taken as visions, Hobbes says. He\nuses this to explain a supposed vision had by Marcus Brutus, and also\nwidespread belief in ghosts, goblins, and the like. Later he uses it\nto account for visions of God (Hobbes 1651, 32.6). And Hobbes\nexplicitly uses this to undermine the plausibility of claims to know\nthings because told by God:\n\n\nTo say he [God] hath spoken to him in a dream is no more than to say\nthat he dreamed God spake to him, which is not of force to win belief\nfrom any man that knows dreams are for the most part natural and may\nproceed from former thoughts \u2026 To say he hath seen a vision, or\nheard a voice, is to say that he hath dreamed between sleeping and\nwaking; for in such a manner a man doth many times naturally take his\ndream for a vision, as not having well observed his own slumbering\n(Hobbes 1651, 32.6)\n\n\nThis does not rule out the possibility that God might indeed\ncommunicate directly with an individual by means of a vision. But it\ndoes rule out other people sensibly believing reports of such\noccurrences, for the events reported are easily (and usually if not\nnecessarily always correctly) given a natural explanation as dreams,\nwhich themselves have natural causes.\n\nHobbes takes a similarly sceptical attitude to reports of miracles.\nChapter 37 of Leviathan is a discussion of this topic,\ncentred on Hobbes\u2019s definition of a miracle as \u201ca work\nof God (besides his operation by the way of nature, ordained\nin the creation), done for the making manifest to his elect\nthe mission of an extraordinary minister for their\nsalvation\u201d (Hobbes 1651, 37.7). Though there is some\ndispute about exactly what Hobbes is doing there, there clearly is a\ngood deal of talk about \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cpretended\u201d\nmiracles, with an emphasis on the possibility of trickery, and a\nwarning about believing too hastily in reports of miracles. The\nconclusion is weaker than that of Hume\u2019s more famous argument\nabout the evidence for belief in miracles, but a similar sceptical\nattitude is present.\n\nThe case has often been made, however, that Hobbes was not just\nsomewhat sceptical about some religious claims, but actually denied\nthe existence of God. The idea is that, though Hobbes says that God\nexists, those statements are just cover for his atheism. Moreover,\nthese interpreters claim, there are various pieces of evidence that\npoint to this hidden underlying view. Opinions differ on what the\ncrucial evidence of the hidden atheism is. Jesseph (2002), for\ninstance, argues that Hobbes\u2019s claims about a material God do\nnot add up. Curley (1992) argues that Hobbes\u2019s discussions of\nprophecy and miracles, taken together, contain a suggestive\nproblem.\n\n\nThere is (what I would take to be) a fairly obvious problem of\ncircularity here: in the chapter on miracles we are to judge the\nauthenticity of a miracle by the authenticity of the doctrine it is\nused to support, but in the chapter on prophecy we had to judge the\nprophet\u2019s claim to be God\u2019s spokesman by his performance\nof miracles. If Hobbes is aware of this circularity, he does not call\nattention to it. Perhaps he just did not notice it. Perhaps, as\nStrauss might have suggested, he leaves it to the reader to discover\nthis for himself. (Curley 1992, \u00a75).\n\n\nThere are some tricky general methodological questions here, about\nwhen we can reasonably say that an author is trying to communicate a\nview other than the one apparently stated. Note, however, that for\nsomeone allegedly covering up his atheism to avoid controversy, Hobbes\ntook the curious approach of saying many other intensely controversial\nthings. He was opposed to free will and to immaterial souls, opposed\nto Presbyterianism and to Roman Catholicism, and managed to have\nanti-royalists thinking he was a royalist, but at least one prominent\nroyalist (Clarendon) thinking he supported Cromwell. This was not a\nrecipe for a quiet life. One might see Hobbes as thinking that these\nthings could be said with controversy, but God\u2019s existence only\ndenied with genuine danger. But one needs, at least, a fairly complex\nstory about Hobbes\u2019s attitudes in order to sustain the view that\nhe was sneakily suggesting that God didn\u2019t exist.\n",
