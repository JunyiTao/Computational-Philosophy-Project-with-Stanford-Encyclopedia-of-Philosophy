    "main_text": "Materialism\n3. Materialism\n\nBy the time of Leviathan and De Corpore, Hobbes was\nconvinced that human beings (including their minds) were entirely\n material.[3]\n Later on he came to think that even God was a sort of material being\n(Gorham 2013, Springborg 2012). This section focuses on Hobbes\u2019s\nmaterialism about human beings. This was not a popular or widely-held\nposition at the time. Hobbes, however, was a materialist. Why was he a\nmaterialist?\n\nWe might suspect that Hobbes\u2019s story about the workings of mind\nand language (e.g., in the early chapters of Leviathan) is\nsupposed to be an implicit argument for materialism.\n\u2018Look\u2019, we might take Hobbes to be saying, \u2018I can\nexplain all the workings of the mind using only material resources.\nWhat need is there to postulate an immaterial mind when this perfectly\ngood, and more minimal, explanation is available?\u2019 Hobbes\nperhaps suggests this when he notes that his nominalism means we do\nnot need to suppose there\u2019s any faculty other than imagination\nin order to understand how universal thought works (Hobbes 1655, 2.9).\nHowever, for the most part we do not find Hobbes explicitly stating\nthat argument. Instead he presents a series of arguments against\nvarious opponents\u2019 beliefs in immaterial beings (including\nimmaterial human minds).\n\nThere is a prominent suggestion in Leviathan that our\ndiscourse about incorporeal things constitutes \u201cinsignificant\nspeech\u201d.\n\n\nAll other names are but insignificant sounds; and those of two sorts.\nOne when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by\ndefinition; whereof there have been abundance coined by schoolmen, and\npuzzled philosophers.\n\nAnother, when men make a name of two names, whose significations are\ncontradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an incorporeal\nbody, or (which is all one) an incorporeal\nsubstance, and a great number more. For whensoever any\naffirmation is false, the two names of which it is composed, put\ntogether and made one, signify nothing at all (Hobbes 1655,\n4.20\u20131).\n\n\nThus Hobbes apparently thinks that talk about incorporeal substances\n(such as Cartesian unextended thinking things) is just nonsense. But\nwhy does he think that? Hobbes\u2019s comment about false\naffirmations suggests he thinks that \u2018incorporeal\nsubstance\u2019 is insignificant because \u2018a substance is\nincorporeal\u2019 is false. But that seems to derive the\ninsignificance from the truth of materialism, which is hardly going to\nconvince Hobbes\u2019s opponents. Hobbes does offer a supporting\nargument, when he claims that \u2018incorporeal substance\u2019 and\n\u2018incorporeal body\u2019 are \u201call one\u201d. But that\npremise too will be denied by his opponents, who think that there can\nbe substances that are not bodies, and that \u2018substance\u2019\nand \u2018body\u2019 are far from interchangeable terms.\n\nHobbes offers a further argument against his opponents\u2019 belief\nin immaterial things in De Corpore, in a passage in which he\ntalks at length about the \u201cgross errors\u201d of\nphilosophers.\n\n\nBut the abuse consists in this, that when some men see that the\nincreases and decreases of quantity, heat, and other accidents can be\nconsidered, that is, submitted to reasons, as we say, without\nconsideration of bodies or their subjects (which is called\n\u201cabstraction\u201d or \u201cexistence apart from them\u201d),\nthey talk about accidents as if they could be separated from every\nbody. The gross errors of certain metaphysicians take their origin\nfrom this; for from the fact that it is possible to consider thinking\nwithout considering body, they infer that there is no need for a\nthinking body; and from the fact that it is possible to consider\nquantity without considering body, they also think that quantity can\nexist without body and body without quantity, so that a quantitative\nbody is made only after quantity has been added to a body. These\nmeaningless vocal sounds, \u201cabstract substances,\u201d\n\u201cseparated essence,\u201d and other similar ones, spring from\nthe same fountain (Hobbes 1655, 3.4).\n\n\nThe key mistake, Hobbes thinks, lies in moving from the observations\nthat we can talk about \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, and can\nthink about A without thinking about B, to the conclusion that A can\nexist without B existing. Hobbes attacks various views associated with\nthe Scholastic Aristotelian tradition as resting on that mistake. One\naim of this critical passage is to support materialism by showing a\nproblem with the belief that there can be thought without a body.\nHobbes elsewhere claims that Aristotle thinks that \u201cthe human\nsoul, separated from man, subsists by itself\u201d, so presumably has\nAristotle and Aristotelians in mind as targets (Hobbes 1668b,\n46.17).\n\nWhen Hobbes talks about Aristotelian views, one might ask whether his\ntarget is Aristotle himself, or some later Aristotelians. When Hobbes\ntalks about Aristotelian metaphysics in particular, his main approach\nseems to be to take a certain core view to have been\nAristotle\u2019s, then to criticize both that view and the further\nuses that were made of it. Hobbes\u2019s attitude to Aristotelianism\ncomes across forcefully in a discussion in Behemoth that\nbegins by describing Peter Lombard and John Duns Scotus as writing\nlike \u201ctwo of the most egregious blockheads in the world\u201d\n(Hobbes 1668a, 41\u20132). That exchange has several elements: the\ncondemnation of the philosophical view as nonsensical; the claim that\nsome philosophers aim to confuse; and the claim that views are\npromoted in order to control the public and take their money. However,\nthough Hobbes rejected many of the views of the Scholastic\nAristotelian tradition, his work had several connections\nto it, as is illustrated by Leijenhorst 2002.\n\nThe view that there can be thought without a body is also\nDescartes\u2019s view. Indeed, Hobbes may be thinking of\nDescartes\u2019s argument for that view in the Sixth Meditation. A\nkey claim in Descartes\u2019s argument is that \u201cthe fact that I\ncan clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is\nenough to make me certain that the two things are distinct\u201d\n(Descartes 1641a, 2.54). Descartes argues, via that claim, from his\nability to clearly and distinctly conceive of mind apart from body and\nvice versa, to the conclusion that mind and body are really distinct\n(i.e., are two substances, not one). Abstracting away from the\ndetails, we have an argument from the conceivability of mind without\nbody to the conclusion that the mind is not physical. And such an\nargument is one of Hobbes\u2019s targets in the \u201cgross\nerrors\u201d passage.\n\nHowever Descartes, by endorsing that argument, does not endorse the\nclaim that \u2018if I can conceive of A\u2019s existing without\nB\u2019s existing, then A can exist without B existing\u2019. He\nendorses at most the weaker claim that \u2018if I can clearly and\ndistinctly conceive of A\u2019s existing without B existing, then A\ncan exist without B existing\u2019. There\u2019s a special sort of\nconceivability involved here, clear and distinct conceivability, which\nlicenses the move in this case but not in general. Hobbes\u2019s\nargument seems blind to this distinction.\n\nOverall then, something of a puzzle remains. Hobbes clearly was a\nmaterialist about the natural world, but the explicit arguments he\noffers for the view seem rather weak. Perhaps he just had a good deal\nof confidence in the ability of the rapidly developing science of the\nhis time to proceed towards a full material explanation of the mind.\nJust as his contemporary William Harvey, of whom he thought very\nhighly, had made such progress in explaining biological matters, so\ntoo (Hobbes might have thought) might we expect further scientists to\nsucceed in explaining mental matters.\n",
