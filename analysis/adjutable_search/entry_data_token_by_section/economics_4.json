    "main_text": "Six central methodological problems || Positive versus normative economics\n2.1 Positive versus normative economics\n\nPolicy makers look to economics to guide policy, and it seems\ninevitable that even the most esoteric issues in theoretical economics\nmay bear on some people\u2019s material interests. The extent to\nwhich economics bears on and may be influenced by normative concerns\nraises methodological questions about the relationships between a\npositive science concerning \u201cfacts\u201d and a\nnormative inquiry into values and what ought to be. Most\neconomists and methodologists believe that there is a reasonably clear\ndistinction between facts and values, between what is and what ought\nto be, and they believe that most of economics should be regarded as a\npositive science that helps policy makers choose means to accomplish\ntheir ends, though it does not bear on the choice of ends itself.\n\nThis view is questionable for several reasons (Mongin 2006, Hausman,\nMcPherson, and Satz 2017). First, economists have to interpret and\narticulate the incomplete specifications of goals and constraints\nprovided by policy makers (Machlup 1969b). Second, economic\n\u201cscience\u201d is a human activity, and like all human\nactivities, it is governed by values. Those values need not be the\nsame as the values that influence economic policy, but it is debatable\nwhether the values that govern the activity of economists can be\nsharply distinguished from the values that govern policy makers.\nThird, much of economics is built around a normative theory of\nrationality. One can question whether the values implicit in such\ntheories are sharply distinguishable from the values that govern\npolicies. For example, it may be difficult to hold a maximizing view\nof individual rationality, while at the same time insisting that\nsocial policy should resist maximizing growth, wealth, or welfare in\nthe name of freedom, rights, or equality. Fourth, people\u2019s views\nof what is right and wrong are, as a matter of fact, influenced by\ntheir beliefs about how people in fact behave. There is evidence that\nstudying theories that depict individuals as self-interested leads\npeople to regard self-interested behavior more favorably and to become\nmore self-interested (Marwell and Ames 1981, Frank et al.\n1993). Finally, people\u2019s judgments are clouded by their\ninterests. Since economic theories bear so centrally on people\u2019s\ninterests, there are bound to be ideological biases at work in the\ndiscipline (Marx 1867, Preface). Positive and normative are especially\ninterlinked within economics, because economists are not all\nresearchers and teachers. In addition, economists work as commentators\nand as it were \u201chired guns\u201d whose salaries depend on\narriving at the conclusions their employers want. The bitter polemics\nconcerning macroeconomic policy responses to the great recession\nbeginning in 2008 testify to the influence of ideology.\n",
