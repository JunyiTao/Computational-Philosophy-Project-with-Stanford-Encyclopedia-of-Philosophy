    "main_text": "Principles of Equality and Justice || Proportional Equality\n2.2 Proportional Equality\n\nAccording to Aristotle, there are two kinds of equality, numerical and\nproportional (Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1130b\u20131132b; cf.\nPlato, Laws, VI.757b\u2013c). A way of treating others, or a\ndistribution arising from it, is equal numerically when it\ntreats all persons as indistinguishable, thus treating them\nidentically or granting them the same quantity of a good per capita.\nThat is not always just. In contrast, a way of treating others or a\ndistribution is proportional or relatively equal when it\ntreats all relevant persons in relation to their due. Just\nnumerical equality is a special case of proportional\nequality. Numerical equality is only just under special circumstances,\nnamely when persons are equal in the relevant respects so that the\nrelevant proportions are equal. Proportional equality further\nspecifies formal equality; it is the more precise and comprehensive\nformulation of formal equality. It indicates what produces an adequate\nequality.\n\nProportional equality in the treatment and distribution of goods to\npersons involves at least the following concepts or variables: Two or\nmore persons \\((P_1, P_2)\\) and two or more allocations of goods to\npersons \\((G)\\) and \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as the quantity in which\nindividuals have the relevant normative quality \\(E\\). This can be\nrepresented as an equation with fractions or as a ratio. If \\(P1\\) has\n\\(E\\) in the amount of \\(X\\) and if \\(P_2\\) has \\(E\\) in the amount\n\\(Y\\), then \\(P_1\\) is due \\(G\\) in the amount of \\(X'\\) and \\(P_2\\) is\ndue \\(G\\) in the amount of \\(Y'\\), so that the ratio \\(X/Y = X'/Y'\\)\nis valid. (For the formula to be usable, the potentially large variety\nof factors involved have to be both quantifiable in principle and\ncommensurable, i.e., capable of synthesis into an aggregate\nvalue.)\n\nWhen factors speak for unequal treatment or distribution, because the\npersons are unequal in relevant respects, the treatment or\ndistribution proportional to these factors is just. Unequal claims to\ntreatment or distribution must be considered proportionally: that is\nthe prerequisite for persons being considered equally.\n\nThis principle can also be incorporated into hierarchical,\ninegalitarian theories. It indicates that equal output is demanded\nwith equal input. Aristocrats, perfectionists, and meritocrats all\nbelieve that persons should be assessed according to their differing\ndeserts, understood in the broad sense of fulfillment of some relevant\ncriterion. Reward and punishment, benefits and burdens, should be\nproportional to such deserts. Since this definition leaves open who is\ndue what, there can be great inequality when it comes to presumed\nfundamental (natural) rights, deserts, and worth -\u2013 this is\napparent in both Plato and Aristotle.\n\nAristotle\u2019s idea of justice as proportional equality contains a\nfundamental insight. The idea offers a framework for a rational\nargument between egalitarian and non-egalitarian ideas of justice, its\nfocal point being the question of the basis for an adequate equality\n(Hinsch 2003). Both sides accept justice as proportional equality.\nAristotle\u2019s analysis makes clear that the argument involves those\nfeatures that decide whether two persons are to be considered equal or\nunequal in a distributive context.\n\nOn the formal level of pure conceptual explication, justice and\nequality are linked through these formal and proportional principles.\nJustice cannot be explained without these equality principles, which\nthemselves only receive their normative significance in their role as\nprinciples of justice.\n\nFormal and proportional equality is simply a conceptual schema. It\nneeds to be made precise \u2013 i.e., its open variables need to be\nfilled out. The formal postulate remains empty as long as it is\nunclear when, or through what features, two or more persons or cases\nshould be considered equal. All debates over the proper conception of\njustice \u2013 over who is due what \u2013 can be understood as\ncontroversies over the question of which cases are equal and which\nunequal (Aristotle, Politics, 1282b 22). For this reason,\nequality theorists are correct in stressing that the claim that\npersons are owed equality becomes informative only when one is told\nwhat kind of equality they are owed (Nagel 1979; Rae 1981;\nSen 1992, p. 13). Every normative theory implies a certain notion of\nequality. In order to outline their position, egalitarians must thus\ntake account of a specific (egalitarian) conception of equality. To do\nso, they need to identify substantive principles of equality, which\nare discussed below.\n",
