    "main_text": "What the Genotype-Phenotype Distinction Signifies || Evolution Defined as Change in Gene Frequencies\n6.2 Evolution Defined as Change in Gene Frequencies\n\nBiological evolution, in its most general construal, is modification\nby descent, that is, change over time in frequency of observed traits\nor forms in a population or a taxonomic group derived from a common\nancestor. A narrower definition, however, arose with the rise of a\ngenotypic conception of heredity, namely, only with changes in\nfrequencies of genes is evolution deemed to be happening. The barrier\nto so-called inheritance of acquired characteristics is held to make\nirrelevant any changes in forms without changes in gene frequencies.\nExponents of extended inheritance disagree, including in their\ndefinition of evolution the changes in the developmental system and\nits constructed niche (Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Adjudication of\nthe disagreement comes down, in part, to a matter of quantity: How\nsignificant are resources other than the genotype (in the sense of the\nDNA of the whole genome) in development of traits that influence\nsurvival and reproductive success? Significance may depend on the\nnumber of generations that the resources are transmitted. The\ndisagreement, however, becomes qualitative, even radical, if attention\nis given to the dynamics of development in an ecological context that\nhad been abstracted away in demonstrating the original genotype\nconception of heredity. Reintegrating developmental dynamics entails\nmore than noting the existence of developmental noise, such as when\nDrosophila individuals are not symmetric in the number of bristles on\neach side. The next subsection elaborates.\n",
