    "main_text": "William of Ockham\n7. Knowledge of First Principles\n\n\nIt is no doubt clear at this point that a large part of the question\nhow we gain natural knowledge has not yet been treated, for we have not\nyet discussed how it is one acquires knowledge of the first principles\nthat enter into demonstration. Grosseteste allowed two forms of\nknowledge. In first principles per se in the first way (so that the\npredicate is contained in the subject) he suggested that through\nsensory experience of particulars of a natural kind, one's intellect is\naroused, and comes to a vision of the real nature of the thing which is\nexpressed in the real definition of the subject. (Aquinas has a similar\nview concerning the first principles of a demonstration of the highest\nsort. With acquaintance with the real definition of a substantial\nnature, one can simply see, intellectually, what its immediate powers\nare.) Since the predicate is contained in the subject, once we have a\nreal definition of the subject in hand, we simply see that the first\nprinciple is true. Roughly speaking, we will simply see what functions\na natural thing has once we understand what it is formally, though we\nwill not yet see how it manages to execute those functions.\n\n\nHow it executes those functions is expressed in principles per se in\nthe second way, so that the subject is somehow implicated in the\npredicate. It is in these first principles that natural causes are\nexpressed. Grosseteste supposes that we have a faculty,\naestimatio, parallel to the senses, which enables us to simply\nsee a particular causal connection. This faculty is no more infallible\nthan are the senses, but after a number of such experiences of a causal\nrelation the intellect will be aroused, and will begin to seek actively\nwhether the apparent causal connection is real or not. To do this, it\nwill attempt to produce experiences in which the apparent cause is\npresent, but nothing else that might be a cause is. If the effect is\nproduced in such situations, it will then conclude the first principle,\nwhich will assert the material definition of the attribute to its\nformal definition. For instance, through experience we might note that\nthunder is caused by the extinction of fire, and express this in the\nprinciple that thunder, considered formally (as a noise in a cloud,\nperhaps with a certain function of frightening those in Hades), is in\nfact the same as noise in a cloud produced by the extinction of fire\n(the material realization of this function of frightening by a loud\nnoise). Or we might note that anger (as the desire to harm someone) is\nin fact, in this world, the same thing as the boiling of blood around\nthe heart (the material conditions for its realization). Thus he takes\ncausal principles to describe how a form is realized (made actual)\ngiven certain material resources. To see what material resources in\nfact realize the form, sensory experience, aided by reason, is\nneeded.\n\n\nAquinas, it is to be noted, holds that we know all the principles of\na demonstration of the highest sort through an intellectual vision of\nthe substantial nature of the subject, for this tells us the real\ndefinition, and so reveals the minor premise, per se in the first way,\nand it also enables us to see, through the intellect, what primary\nattribute arises through emanatio from such a thing. Like\nGrosseteste, Aquinas thinks that the causal capacities of things (their\nfunctions) must be understood to know what they are, but he sees no\nproblem in working out how these forms do what they do within the\nactual world. In the case of the highest form of demonstration, they\nsimply do it. It is as though we were to say that an adding\nmachine adds, without concerning ourselves how it must be designed to\ndo so. Of course, real natural substances are simple, and artificial\nthings like adding machines are not. An adding machine adds because of\nthe way it is put together, but it is absurd to say that heat heats or\na person knows, because of the way it is put together, for it is\nnot put together. There must be something for which simply to\nexist is to exercise its function, or else we have an infinite regress,\nand must explain every functioning as though it were the functioning of\na complex machine, without ever settling on simple parts for the\nmachine which simply function as they do because of what they are. It\nis Aquinas who lies behind Descartes's view that first principles in\nthe sciences are clearly and distinctly perceived by reason.\n\n\nDuns Scotus seems to have retained Grosseteste's empiricist bent.\nSome causal principles are known per se, for instance, that an opaque\nthing placed between something illuminated and its light source will\nblock the light and leave that thing in the dark. Here, anyone who\nknows the definitions of the terms (in the example, of\n\u2018opaque\u2019) can work out the principle from there. But, like\nGrosseteste, he also thought some principles can only be discovered\nthrough experience. So he advances the notion that\n\u201cWhatever occurs in many instances by a cause that is not\nfree is the natural effect of that cause.\u201d He seems to assume\nthat a sufficient number of observations will lead to cases in which\nthe cause fails, if it ever does. In any case, this seems to continue\nGrosseteste's empiricist tendencies, for he apparently assumes that a\nsimple substance must be observed to function before one can conclude\nthrough reason that it functions as it does. Aquinas would no doubt\nsay that such observation of the immediate functioning of a simple\nsubstance is necessary in order to acquire a concept of its\nsubstantial nature, and so its real definition. A real definition of a\nsubstance will specify its natural effect, and we do not infer its\nfunctioning from experience, but rather use experience to abstract its\nreal definition.\n\n\nOckham thought that the causal power of a most specific natural kind\n(infima species) can be known through the observation of a\nsingle instance. So the curative power of an herb, or the ability of\nheat to produce heat in something adjacent to it, can be concluded by\nreason from a single instance. The principle at work here states that\neverything in a given most specific natural kind which acts produces\neffects of the same kind. He thus seems to refer to a version of the\nuniformity of nature. He is perfectly clear that the real definition of\na simple substance, since it does not signify anything outside the\nsubstance, cannot tell us what its effects are. Here we find the roots\nof Early Modern Empiricism.\n",
