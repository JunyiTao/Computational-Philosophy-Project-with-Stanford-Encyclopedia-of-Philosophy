    "main_text": "Unorthodox Conceptions of Persons || Jaina\n2.1 Jaina\n\nAmong the non-Hindu traditions, we begin with Jaina conception of\npersons because it is closest to the Hindu conception, specifically\nthat of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and\nS\u0101\u1e43khya schools. Like the S\u0101\u1e43khya, the Jainas\nare essentially dualistic. The universe is constituted by two kinds of\nthings: living (j\u012bva) and non-living\n(aj\u012bva) akin to puru\u1e63a anf\nprak\u1e5bti. The self is described in Jaina from the\nnoumenal and the phenomenal points of view. From the ultimate or\nnoumenal points of view the self or the soul is pure and perfect,\ncharacterised by pure consciousness. It is a simple, immaterial and\nformless substance. From the phenomenal point of view, the soul is\ndescribed as life force (pr\u0101na) which in conjunction the\nnon-living forces is manifested in various life forms, including human\npersons. The Jainas posit only four non-living (aj\u012bva)\nforces: matter or pudgala which is manifested as karma, time, space\nand movement (Kalghatgi, 1965). The coming together of these things is\nthe Jaina conception of life as pervading all aspects of the natural\nworld. Each life-form stands within a hierarchy of ascent from\nelemental beings, microbes and plants, worms, insects and the array of\nfish, reptiles, amphibians and mammals all the way to persons. The\nnature of the next birth is dependent of the actions performed in the\nimmediate past body, plants and microbes can be reborn higher up in\nthe hierarchy, or mammals can be demoted to lower forms. Persons too\ndepending on whether their actions are virtuous or vicious can be\nreborn in a heavenly realm, or suffer torture in one of the seven\nhells. Persons at the top of the hierarchy, are unique in that they\nare able to perform the karmic necessary purgations to attain\nfreedom or liberation (kevala), the highest end which is\nbreak free from the cycle of birth and rebirth. The story so far is\nnot very different from what we find in the Hindu texts, except that\nkarma is literally a material force.\n\nThe Jainas also agree with the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 that the essence and the qualities of the\nself are not totally separate from each other. They are two aspects of\nthe same thing: one and the same self substance is unchanging and\neternal when viewed from one point of view, and changing when viewed\nfrom another point of view. Its permanence is indexed to its essence\nand its impermanence to its qualities to allow for the very same self\nto be transformed through the cycle of birth and rebirth. Though there\nis much similarity between Jaina and the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view, there is a curious difference. The\nJainas think that though the self is immaterial, it changes it size\naccording to the body with which it is associated. The self, so to\nsay, fits the body it is housed in.\n\nAgain, though there is not much explicit discussion of persons in the\nJaina tradition, the notion of a person is present as a moral agent\nwith the capacity for attaining the highest freedom or liberation.\nPersons alone have the capacity to escape the cycle of birth and\nrebirth. Moral agency requires sensitivity to the nature of our world,\naccording to which all living beings are said to be interconnected.\nThis brings with it a moral obligation to respect all living beings\nincluding plants and not be unscrupulous in using natural resources.\nWhat makes us the same person over time is the soul substance, so the\nJainas would also be classified as Non-Reductionists about persons in\ncontemporary parlance.\n",
