Individually-Based Accounts and Radical Cognitive Disability: The Challenge of Exclusion\n\nIf full moral status is determined by the possession of any of the\ncognitive attributes discussed in the last section, then that status\nwill be enjoyed by some non-human animals and\u2014more\nproblematically\u2014almost certainly lacked by some humans. Most\nproponents of individually-based attribute accounts welcome the\nimplication that we cannot justify existing disparities between our\ntreatment of \u201chigher\u201d animals and cognitively disabled\nhuman beings, and many argue that those disparities are better reduced\nby raising our standards for non-human animals than by lowering them\nfor cognitively disabled humans.\n\n\nThe optimal point of convergence \u2026 requires that traditional\nbeliefs about animals be more extensively revised than traditional\nviews about the severely retarded. (McMahan 2002, 230)\n\n\nBut full convergence, as McMahan recognizes, would have disturbing\nimplications even if it were achieved entirely by upgrading the\ntreatment of nonhuman animals: \n\n\n[T]he preservation of the traditional view [that it is seriously wrong\nto kill an anencephalic infant] will commit us to the conclusion that\nit is seriously wrong to kill an animal that altogether lacks the\ncapacity for consciousness. And this is unacceptable. (2002, 230) \n\n\nConvergence at a significantly lower level would have equally\nunacceptable implications. For example, it would permit the use of\nradically impaired human beings in any research, however harmful, for\nwhich the use of animals with comparable cognitive capacities was\npermitted. Any view about moral status that aspires to reflective\nequilibrium with our deeply held moral convictions must confront the\nabhorrence with which most thoughtful people would regard the\npractical implications of treating humans with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as having even slightly lower moral status than the rest\nof us.\n\nA variety of approaches seek to address that abhorrence: by\nidentifying criteria for full moral status that include a wider range\nof humanity\n (Sec. 4.1);\n by expanding the ways in which an individual can possess or achieve\nfull moral status without denying the primacy of individual attributes\n (Sec. 4.2);\n and by rejecting individual attribute accounts of moral status\n (Sec. 5).\n",
