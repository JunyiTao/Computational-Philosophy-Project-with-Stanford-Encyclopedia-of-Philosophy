Is there any nothingness?\n\nThe trouble sustaining multiple voids may push us to the most extreme\nanswer to \u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019,\nnamely, \u2018There must not only be something but there must not be\nany emptiness at all!\u2019.\n\nParmenides maintained that it is self-defeating to say that something\ndoes not exist. The linguistic rendering of this insight is the\nproblem of negative existentials: \u2018Atlantis does not\nexist\u2019 is about Atlantis. A statement can be about something\nonly if that something exists. No relation without relata! Therefore,\n\u2018Atlantis does not exist\u2019 cannot be true. Parmenides and\nhis disciples elaborated conceptual difficulties with negation into an\nincredible metaphysical monolith.\n\nThe Parmenideans were opposed by the atomists. The atomists said that\nthe world is constituted by simple, indivisible things moving in empty\nspace. They self-consciously endorsed the void to explain empirical\nphenomena such as movement, compression, and absorption.\n\nParmenides\u2019s disciple, Zeno of Elea, had already amassed an\namazing battery of arguments to show motion is impossible. Since these\nimply that compression and absorption are also impossible, Zeno\nrejects the data of the atomists just as physicists reject the data of\nparapsychologists.\n\nLess radical opponents of vacuums, such as Aristotle, re-explained the\ndata within a framework of plenism: although the universe is full,\nobjects can move because other objects get out of the way. Compression\nand absorption can be accommodated by having things pushed out of the\nway when other things jostle their way in.\n\nIn the Timaeus, Aristotle\u2019s teacher Plato attempted to\ncombine atomism with plenism as a \u201clikely story\u201d. The\natoms are the Platonic solids (regular, convex polyhedra), each having\na distinctive role in the composition of objects. Aristotle objects\nthat the Platonic solids cannot fill space. Every arrangement of\nPlatonic solids yields the sort of gaps that one can more readily\npredict in a universe composed solely of spherical atoms.\n\nAristotle agrees that atoms could fill space if they were all cubes.\nPressing his luck, Aristotle goes on to claim that tetrahedra can also\ncomplete space. It is testament to Aristotle\u2019s subsequent\nauthority that this claim was accepted for seventeen hundred\nyears\u2014despite being easily refutable by anyone trying to snugly\ncombine tetrahedral blocks. Almost any choice of shapes guarantees\ninterstitial vacua. This geometrical pressure for tiny vacua creates a\nprecedent for the cosmic void (which surrounds the material cosmos)\nand the intermediate empty spaces that provide a promising explanation\nof how motion is possible.\n\nYet Aristotle denied the void can explain how things move. Movement\nrequires a mover that is pushing or pulling the object. An object in a\nvacuum is not in contact with anything else. If the object did move,\nthere would be nothing to impede its motion. Therefore, any motion in\na vacuum would be at an unlimited speed. This conflicts with the\nprinciple that no object can be in two separate places at the same\ntime.\n\nAristotle\u2019s refutation of the void persuaded most commentators\nfor the next 1500 years. There were two limited dissenters to his\nthesis that vacuums are impossible. The Stoics agreed that terrestrial\nvacuums are impossible but believed there must be a void surrounding\nthe cosmos. Hero of Alexandria agreed that there are no naturally\noccurring vacuums but believed that they can be formed artificially.\nHe cites pumps and siphons as evidence that voids can be created. Hero\nbelieved that bodies have a natural horror of vacuums and struggle to\nprevent their formation. You can feel the antipathy by trying to open\na bellows that has had its air hole plugged. Try as you might, you\ncannot separate the sides. However, unlike Aristotle, Hero thought\nthat if you and the bellows were tremendously strong, you could\nseparate the sides and create a vacuum.\n\nHero\u2019s views became more discussed after the Church\u2019s\nanti-Aristotelian condemnation of 1277 which required Christian\nscholars to allow for the possibility of a vacuum. The immediate\nmotive was to preserve God\u2019s omnipotence. God could have chosen\nto create the world in a different spot. He could have made it bigger\nor smaller. God could have also chosen to make the universe a\ndifferent shape. These possibilities entail the possibility of a\nvacuum.\n\nA second motivation is a literal reading of Genesis 1:1. This opening\npassage of the Bible describes God as creating the world from nothing.\nSuch a construction seems logically impossible. Commitment to an\nillogical miracle jeopardized the Christian\u2019s overarching\ncommitment to avoid outright irrationality. If creation out of nothing\nwere indeed a demonstrable impossibility, then faith would be forced\nto override an answer given by reason rather than merely answer a\nquestion about which reason is silent.\n\nAll Greek philosophy had presupposed creation was from something more\nprimitive, not nothing. Consistently, the Greeks assumed destruction\nwas disassembly into more basic units. (If destruction into\nnothingness were possible, the process could be reversed to get\ncreation from nothing.) The Christians were on their own when trying\nto make sense of creation from nothing. (Ancient Chinese philosophers\nare sometimes translated as parallel believers in creation from\nnothing. JeeLoo Liu (2014) cautions that both the Daoist and\nConfucians are speaking about formlessness rather than\nnothingness.)\n\nCreation out of nothing presupposes the possibility of total\nnothingness. This in turn implies that there can be some nothingness.\nThus Christians had a motive to first establish the possibility of a\nlittle nothingness. Their strategy was to start small and scale\nup.Accordingly, scholars writing in the aftermath of the condemnation\nof 1277 proposed various recipes for creating vacuums (Schmitt 1967).\nOne scheme was to freeze a sphere filled with water. After the water\ncontracted into ice, a vacuum would form at the top.Aristotelians\nreplied that the sphere would bend at its weakest point. When the\nvacuists stipulated that the sphere was perfect, the rejoinder was\nthat this would simply prevent the water from turning into ice.\n\nNeither side appears to have tried out the recipe. If either had, then\nthey would have discovered that freezing water expands rather than\ncontracts. To contemporary thinkers, this dearth of empirical testing\nis bizarre. The puzzle is intensified by the fact that the medievals\ndid empirically test many hypotheses, especially in optics.\n\nHero was eventually refuted by experiments conducted by Evangelista\nTorricelli and Blaise Pascal. In effect, they created a barometer\nconsisting of a tube partially submerged, upside down, in bowl of\nmercury. What keeps the mercury suspended in the tube? Is there an\nunnatural vacuum that causes the surrounding glass to pull the liquid\nup? Or is there no vacuum at all but rather some rarefied and\ninvisible matter in the \u201cempty space\u201d? Pascal answered\nthat there really was nothing holding up the mercury. The mercury\nrises and falls due to variations in the weight of the atmosphere. The\nmercury is being pushed up the tube, not pulled up by\nanything.\n\nWhen Pascal offered this explanation, Descartes wrote Christian\nHuygens (8 December 1647) that the hasty young man had the vacuum too\nmuch on his mind. (A more amusing translation of the letter has\nDescartes complaining that Pascal had too much vacuum in his head;\nalas, Descartes\u2019 writing loses something in the original.)\nDescartes identified bodies with extension and so had no room for\nvacuums. If there were nothing between two objects, then they would be\ntouching each other. And if they are touching each other, there is no\ngap between them.\n\nWell maybe the apparent gap is merely a thinly occupied region of\nspace. On this distributional model, there is no intermediate\n\u201cempty object\u201d that separates the two objects. There is\nmerely unevenly spread matter. This model is very good at eliminating\nvacuums in the sense of empty objects. However, it is also rather good\nat eliminating ordinary objects. What we call objects would just be\nrelatively thick deposits of matter. There would be only one natural\nobject: the whole universe. This may have been the point of\nSpinoza\u2019s attack on vacuums (Bennett 1980). (Indian philosophers\nassociate nothingness with lack of differentiation. They may prefer to\ndescribe Spinoza\u2019s world as a realm of nothingness dominated by\na single overarching unity.)\n\nDescartes was part of a tradition that denied action at a distance.\nThis orthodoxy included Galileo. He was distressed by Johannes\nKepler\u2019s hypothesis that the moon influences the tides because\nthe hypothesis seems to require causal chains in empty space. How\ncould the great Kepler believe something so silly? After Isaac Newton\nresurrected Kepler\u2019s hypothesis he eventually capitulated to\northodoxy and stuffed the space between the moon and the Earth with\nether.\n\nIndeed, the universality of Newton\u2019s law of gravitation seems to\nrequire that the whole universe be filled with a subtle substance. How\nelse could the universe be bound together by causal chains? Hunger for\nether intensified as the wave-like features of light became\nestablished. It is tautologous that a wave must have a medium.\n\nOr is it? As the theoretical roles of the ether proliferated,\nphysicists began to doubt there could be anything that accomplished\nsuch diverse feats. These doubts about the existence of ether were\nintensified by the emergence of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.\nHe presented his theory as a relational account of space; if there\nwere no objects, there would be no space. Space is merely a useful\nabstraction.\n\nEven those physicists who wished to retain substantival space broke\nwith the atomist tradition of assigning virtually no properties to the\nvoid. They re-assign much of ether\u2019s responsibilities to space\nitself. Instead of having gravitational forces being propagated\nthrough the ether, they suggest that space is bent by mass. To explain\nhow space can be finite and yet unbounded, they characterize space as\nspherical. When Edwin Hubble discovered that heavenly bodies are\ntraveling away from each other (like ants resting on an expanding\nballoon), cosmologists were quick to suggest that space may be\nexpanding. \u201cExpanding into what?\u201d wondered bewildered\nlaymen, \u201cHow can space bend?\u201d, \u201cHow can space have a\nshape?\u201d, \u2026.\n\nHistorians of science wonder whether the ether that was loudly pushed\nout the front door of physics is quietly returning through the back\ndoor under the guise of \u201cspace\u201d (Kuhn 1962, 109). Quantum\nfield theory provides especially fertile ground for such speculation.\nParticles are created with the help of energy present in\n\u201cvacuums\u201d. To say that vacuums have energy and energy is\nconvertible into mass, is to deny that vacuums are empty. Many\nphysicists revel in the discovery that vacuums are far from empty.\n\nFrank Wilczek (1980), Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow (2010, 180)\nas well as Lawrence Krauss (2012) explicitly claim that this answers\nthe question of why there is something rather than nothing. The basic\nidea goes back to an issue raised by the symmetry of matter and\nanti-matter. Given that the symmetry implies equality, matter and\nanti-matter should have annihiliated each other. Creation should have\nbeen aborted. Why is there NOW something (particles) rather than\nnothing (mere energy in a quantum field)? This question was answered\nby calculations suggesting that there was about a billionth more\nmatter than anti-matter. Although it is still possible for the\nuniverse to be without particles, the slight numeric imbalance biases\nthe universe toward states in which there are many particles. A small\nrandom change can trigger a phase transition analogous to the\ntransformation of very cold liquid beer into solid beer when the cap\nof the bottle is popped (suddenly reducing the pressure in the\nbottle).\n\nA proud physicist is naturally tempted to announce these insights\nthrough the bullhorn of metaphysics. But philosophers interested in\nthe logic of questions will draw attention to the role of emphasis in\nframing requests for explanations. \u2018Why did Eve eat the\napple?\u2019, \u2018Why did Eve eat the apple?\u2019, and\n\u2018Why did Eve eat the apple?\u2019 are different\nquestions because they specify different contrast classes (van\nFraassen 1980, 127\u2013130). Philosophers read \u2018Why is there\nsomething rather than nothing?\u2019 tenselessly as in \u2018Why is\n\u03c0 an irrational number?\u2019. The philosophers also read\n\u2018something\u2019 as a quantifier ranging over any concrete\nentity. The quantum vacuum is a concrete entity (in the sense\ndescribed in sections 4 and 7) and so is in the philosopher\u2019s\ndomain of discourse. But for rhetorical effect, physicists\nanachronistically back-date their domain of discourse to the things of\nnineteenth century physics. Thus the physicists wind up addressing\n\u2018Why is there some thing rather than\nnothing?\u2019.\n\nPhilosophers complain of misleading advertising. They asked one\nquestion and the proud physicists answered a different question.\nLawrence Krauss defends the switch as an improvement. Often scientists\nmake progress by altering the meaning of key terms. Why stick with an\nintractable (and arguably meaningless) question? We should wriggle\nfree from the dead hand of the past and rejuvenate our curiosity with\nthe vocabulary of contemporary cosmology.\n\nThe physicist turned philosopher, Rudolf Carnap (1950), recalls how\nthermodynamicists explicated \u201cheat\u201d into the more\nprecise concepts of temperature, thermal energy, and heat transfer.\nAlthough the new terms are not synonymous with the old, they bear\nenough similarity to disarm the objection that the physicists are\nmerely changing the topic. Our questions, like our children, can\nmature without losing their identity over time. (The idea of there\nbeing two different questions being asked is pursued in Carroll 2012,\nOther Internet Resources.)\n\nDavid Albert is open to the possibility of old questions being\nimproved by new interests and discoveries. However, he denies that\nLawrence Krauss\u2019s particular change of meaning constitutes an\nimprovement (2012, Other Internet Resources):\n\nRelativistic-quantum-field-theoretical vacuum states\u2014no less\nthan giraffes or refrigerators or solar systems\u2014are particular\narrangements of elementary physical stuff. The true\nrelativistic-quantum-field-theoretical equivalent to there not being\nany physical stuff at all isn\u2019t this or that particular\narrangement of the fields\u2014what it is (obviously, and\nineluctably, and on the contrary) is the simple absence of\nthe fields! The fact that some arrangements of fields happen to\ncorrespond to the existence of particles and some don\u2019t is not a\nwhit more mysterious than the fact that some of the possible\narrangements of my fingers happen to correspond to the existence of a\nfist and some don\u2019t. And the fact that particles can pop in and\nout of existence, over time, as those fields rearrange themselves, is\nnot a whit more mysterious than the fact that fists can pop in and out\nof existence, over time, as my fingers rearrange themselves. And none\nof these poppings\u2014if you look at them aright\u2014amount to\nanything even remotely in the neighborhood of a creation from nothing.\n\n",
