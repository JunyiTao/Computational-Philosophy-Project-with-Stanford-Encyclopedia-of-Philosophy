    "main_text": "Projective geometry\n3. Projective geometry\n\nIn the opinion of many in the 19th century, Euclidean\ngeometry lost its fundamental status to a geometry that was regarded\nas more general: projective geometry. (For an introduction to geometry\nin the 19th century, see Gray 2011. Projective geometry is\ndescribed in the entry,\n Nineteenth Century Geometry,\n see also the essays by various authors in Bioesmat-Martagon 2011.)\nProjective geometry has its own foundational problem, akin to that of\ndistance in Euclidean geometry, which concerns the concept of\ncross-ratio, and we need to follow the moves to create projective\ngeometry as an independent subject, to define cross-ratio in this\nsetting, and to resolve the epistemological issues that are raised (an\nachievement associated with Klein\u2019s Erlangen Programme). We\nshall also see that the growth of projective geometry creates the\narena for Hilbert\u2019s axiomatisation of geometry.\n\nThe origins of this geometric theory lay in the 17th century, with\nDesargues and Pascal, but plane projective geometry took a particular\nboost from Jean Victor Poncelet\u2019s book of 1822 Trait\u00e9\ndes propri\u00e9t\u00e9s projectives des figures where he\nshowed the power of projective methods under the provocative\nformulation of non-metrical geometry. The fundamental character of the\nnew geometry resides in the way it can be thought of as capturing the\nsimplest properties of the straight line\u2014two distinct points\ndefine a unique line, two distinct lines meet in at most one\npoint\u2014while discarding the metrical concepts of distance and\nangle.\n\nPoncelet\u2019s claims for transformations of the plane that map\nlines to lines were rewritten by Chasles (1837) in a more rigorous way\nthat highlighted the invariance of cross-ratio. Consider \\(AB\\) to\nrepresent the distance between the two points. The cross-ratio of four\npoints \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\) on a line is defined to be\n\\(AB{\\cdot}CD \\mathbin{/} AD{\\cdot}CB\\), and if the points are mapped\nto \\(A'\\), \\(B'\\), \\(C'\\), \\(D'\\) respectively by a projective\ntransformation, then \n\n\\[ \\frac{AB\\cdot CD}{AD\\cdot CB} = \\frac{A'B'\\cdot C'D'}{A'D'\\cdot C'B'}. \\]\n\n\nHowever, this left the subject in the uncomfortable position of\nseeming to be more general than Euclidean geometry, because Euclidean,\nmetrical, transformations are projective transformations but not\nconversely, while still seeming to rely on a metrical concept in the\ndefinition of its fundamental invariant.\n\nThis issue was tackled in the 1840s and 1850s by Georg Karl Christian\nvon Staudt. His two books (1847, 1856\u20131860) attempted to give\nfoundations for projective geometry that made it an autonomous\nsubject, independent of Euclidean geometry. They were hard to read,\nand imperfect in a number of ways, but the task of creating a rigorous\ntheory could be seen for the first time as a matter of completing a\ntask already begun. Von Staudt argued that the transformations of\nplane projective geometry could map any triple of collinear points to\nany other, and any quadruple of points (no three of which were\ncollinear) to any other, but not any quadruple of collinear points to\nany other. He then made a detailed study of collinear quadruples. He\nalso made brief remarks about how Euclidean geometry could be obtained\nfrom projective geometry, and from these it could be seen that his\ntheory of collinear quadruples reduced to the familiar theory of\ncross-ratio as soon as the concept of Euclidean distance was added to\nprojective geometry. This insight was made clear and explicit by Felix\nKlein in a number of papers in the early 1870s. The first readable\ntextbook on projective geometry, and the one that gave it its name,\nwas Cremona\u2019s Elementi di geometria projettiva of 1873,\nand after that the subject swiftly rose to become the fundamental\nclassical geometry.\n\nIts basic concepts were the points, lines, and planes of a space that\nwas \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) enriched with what was often called a plane at\ninfinity, so that any two coplanar lines meet. Prior to\naxiomatisations of the theory at the end of the 19th\ncentury, point, line, and plane were basic concepts with an intuitive\ninterpretation that allowed for a ready passage between projective and\nEuclidean geometry. The allowed transformations of the geometry map\npoints to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes and preserve\ncross-ratio. They act transitively on the space, so no point, line, or\nplane is special, and therefore lines that are parallel in any finite\npart of the space may be mapped to intersecting lines and vice\nversa.\n\nIn its synthetic form the successes of projective geometry were\nlargely confined to the simplification it brought to the study of\nconics\u2014all non-degenerate conics (the circle, ellipse, parabola,\nand hyperbola) are projectively equivalent. In its algebraic form\nprojective geometry proved itself almost essential in the study of\nplane algebraic curves of any degree, and, extended to projective\nspaces of higher dimensions, to the study of algebraic surfaces. All\nthis contributed to the central importance attributed to a\nnon-metrical geometry based on little more than the concept of the\nstraight line and on the incidence properties of lines and planes.\n\nProjective geometry also possessed one startling feature, called\nduality, which stimulated epistemological reflections on its possible\nsource. In plane projective geometry it is possible to exchange the\nterms \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018line\u2019,\n\u2018coincident\u2019 and \u2018concurrent\u2019 and in this way\nobtain from a valid statement a new one. As a result all definitions,\ntheorems, and proofs in projective geometry have a dual character. The\ndual of the statement of Desargues\u2019 theorem and its proof, for\nexample, is the converse of the theorem and its proof. In three\ndimensions, the terms \u2018point\u2019 and \u2018plane\u2019 can\nbe exchanged in the same way, leaving \u2018lines\u2019\nunchanged. This raises intriguing epistemological issues: duality was\nregarded by Cremona as a law of logic; also, it is easy to conceive of\nthe plane as made up of points, but impossible to regard it\nintuitively as made up of lines. To make matters worse, space is\nthree-dimensional when regarded as made up of points, but\nfour-dimensional when made up of lines.\n",
