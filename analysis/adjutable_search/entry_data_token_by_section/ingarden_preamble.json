    "main_text": "\n\n\nRoman Ingarden (1893\u20131970) was a Polish phenomenologist,\nontologist and aesthetician. A student of Edmund Husserl\u2019s from the\nG\u00f6ttingen period, Ingarden was a realist phenomenologist who spent\nmuch of his career working against what he took to be Husserl\u2019s turn to\ntranscendental idealism. As preparatory work for narrowing down\npossible solutions to the realism/idealism problem, Ingarden developed\nontological studies unmatched in scope and detail, distinguishing\ndifferent kinds of dependence and different modes of being. He is best\nknown, however, for his work in aesthetics, particularly on the\nontology of the work of art and the status of aesthetic values, and is\ncredited with being the founder of phenomenological aesthetics. His\nwork The Literary Work of Art has been widely influential in\nliterary theory as well as philosophical aesthetics, and has been\ncrucial to the development of New Criticism and Reader Response\nTheory.\n",
