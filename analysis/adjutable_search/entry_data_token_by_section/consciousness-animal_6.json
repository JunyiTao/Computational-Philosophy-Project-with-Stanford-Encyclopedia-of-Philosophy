    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || Cognition and Consciousness\n4.3 Cognition and Consciousness\nMany scientists and philosophers remain convinced that even if some\nquestions about animal minds are empirically tractable, no amount of\nexperimentation can provide access to  phenomenal consciousness\n per se. This remains true even among those who are willing to\ninvoke cognitive explanations of animal behavior that advert to\ninternal representations. Opposition to dealing with consciousness can\nbe understood in part as a legacy of behavioristic psychology first\nbecause of the behaviorists\u2019 rejection of terms for unobservables\nunless they could be formally defined in terms of observables, or\notherwise operationalized experimentally, and second because of the\nstrong association in many behaviorists\u2019 minds between the use of\nmentalistic terms and the twin bugaboos of Cartesian dualism and\nintrospectionist psychology. In some cases\nthese scientists are even dualists themselves, but they are strongly\ncommitted to denying the possibility of scientifically investigating\nconsciousness, and remain skeptical of all attempts to bring it into\nthe scientific mainstream.\nAlso important has been a line of argumentation by philosophers\nthat the subjective nature of consciousness makes it inherently\ndifficult to study. Block\u2019s (1995) influential distinction between\nphenomenal and access consciousness was framed as part of a critique of\ntreatments of consciousness in the psychological literature: by\nfailing to properly distinguish between consciousness as experience\n(phenomenal consciousness) and consciousness as general availability\nof information (access consciousness), scientists were equivocating\n\u2014 drawing conclusions about consciousness in the phenomenal\nsense from premises about consciousness in the access sense. The\nconceptual distinction between access consciousness and phenomenal\nconsciousness, and the difficulty of gaining empirical traction on the\nlatter, has been seen as a major hurdle to empirical consciousness\nstudies. Block himself has recently been more optimistic, even arguing\nthat certain experiments can empirically tease apart phenomenal and\naccess consciousness (Block 2011). But the distinction between access\nand phenomenal consciousness does raise special methodological hurdles\nfor those who want to study the latter empirically.\n\n\nBecause consciousness is assumed to be private or subjective, it is\noften taken to be beyond the reach of objective scientific methods\n(e.g., Nagel 1974). This claim might be taken in either of two\nways. On the one hand it might be taken to bear on the possibility of\nanswering the Distribution Question, i.e., to reject the possibility\nof knowledge that a member of another taxonomic group (e.g., a bat)\nhas conscious states. On the other hand it might be taken to bear on\nthe possibility of answering the Phenomenological Question, i.e., to\nreject the possibility of knowledge of the phenomenological details of\nthe mental states of a member of another taxonomic group. The\ndifference between believing with justification that a bat is\nconscious and knowing what it is like to be a bat is\nimportant because, at best, the privacy of conscious experience\nsupports a negative conclusion only about the latter. To support a\nnegative conclusion about the former, one must also assume that\nconsciousness has absolutely no measurable effects on behavior, i.e.,\none must accept epiphenomenalism.\nBut if one rejects epiphenomenalism and maintains that consciousness\ndoes have effects on behavior then a strategy of inference to the best\nexplanation may be used to support its attribution. Moreover, if\nparticular conscious states have particular effects on behavior, then\nthis strategy might be pursued to elucidate some specific features of\nthe conscious experience of other animals, even if some aspects must\nremain out of reach because of our inability, as humans, to fully\ngrasp what it would be like to experience them. More will be said\nabout this in the next section.\n\n\nIf phenomenal consciousness is completely epiphenomenal, as some\nphilosophers believe, then a search for the functions of consciousness\nis doomed to futility. In fact, if consciousness is completely\nepiphenomenal then it cannot have evolved by natural selection. On the\nassumption that phenomenal consciousness is an evolved characteristic\nof human minds, at least, and therefore that epiphenomenalism is\nfalse, then an attempt to understand the biological functions of\nconsciousness may provide the best chance of identifying its\noccurrence in different species.
