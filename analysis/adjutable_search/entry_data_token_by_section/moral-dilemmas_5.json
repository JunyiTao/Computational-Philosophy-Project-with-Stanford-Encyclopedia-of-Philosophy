This argument might be called\n\u201cphenomenological.\u201d It appeals to the emotions that agents\nfacing conflicts experience and our assessment of those emotions.\n\nReturn to the case of Sartre\u2019s student. Suppose that he joins\nthe Free French forces. It is likely that he will experience remorse\nor guilt for having abandoned his mother. And not only will he\nexperience these emotions, this moral residue, but it is appropriate\nthat he does. Yet, had he stayed with his mother and not joined the\nFree French forces, he also would have appropriately experienced\nremorse or guilt. But either remorse or guilt is appropriate only if\nthe agent properly believes that he has done something wrong (or\nfailed to do something that he was all-things-considered required to\ndo). Since no matter what the agent does he will appropriately\nexperience remorse or guilt, then no matter what he does he will have\ndone something wrong. Thus, the agent faces a genuine moral dilemma.\n(The best known proponents of arguments for dilemmas that appeal to\nmoral residue are Williams 1965 and Marcus 1980; for a more recent\ncontribution, see Tessman 2015, especially Chapter 2.)\n\nMany cases of moral conflict are similar to Sartre\u2019s example\nwith regard to the agent\u2019s reaction after acting. Certainly the\ncase from Sophie\u2019s Choice fits here. No matter which of\nher children Sophie saves, she will experience enormous guilt for the\nconsequences of that choice. Indeed, if Sophie did not experience such\nguilt, we would think that there was something morally wrong with her.\nIn these cases, proponents of the argument (for dilemmas) from moral\nresidue must claim that four things are true: (1) when the agents\nacts, she experiences remorse or guilt; (2) that she experiences these\nemotions is appropriate and called for; (3) had the agent acted on the\nother of the conflicting requirements, she would also have experienced\nremorse or guilt; and (4) in the latter case these emotions would have\nbeen equally appropriate and called for (McConnell 1996, pp.\n37\u201338). In these situations, then, remorse or guilt will be\nappropriate no matter what the agent does and these emotions are\nappropriate only when the agent has done something wrong. Therefore,\nthese situations are genuinely dilemmatic and moral failure is\ninevitable for agents who face them.\n\nThere is much to say about the moral emotions and situations of moral\nconflict; the positions are varied and intricate. Without pretending\nto resolve all of the issues here, it will be pointed out that\nopponents of dilemmas have raised two different objections to the\nargument from moral residue. The first objection, in effect, suggests\nthat the argument is question-begging (McConnell 1978 and Conee 1982);\nthe second objection challenges the assumption that remorse and guilt\nare appropriate only when the agent has done wrong.\n\nTo explain the first objection, note that it is uncontroversial that\nsome bad feeling or other is called for when an agent is in a\nsituation like that of Sartre\u2019s student or Sophie. But the\nnegative moral emotions are not limited to remorse and guilt. Among\nthese other emotions, consider regret. An agent can appropriately\nexperience regret even when she does not believe that she has done\nsomething wrong. Consider a compelling example provided by Edmund\nSanturri (1987, 46). Under battlefield conditions, an army medic must\nperform a life-saving amputation of a soldier\u2019s leg with insufficient\nanesthetic. She will surely feel intense regret because of the pain\nshe has inflicted, but justifiably she will not feel that she has done\nwrong. Regret can even be appropriate when a person has no causal\nconnection at all with the bad state of affairs. It is appropriate for\nme to regret the damage that a recent fire has caused to my\nneighbor\u2019s house, the pain that severe birth defects cause in\ninfants, and the suffering that a starving animal experiences in the\nwilderness. Not only is it appropriate that I experience regret in\nthese cases, but I would probably be regarded as morally lacking if I\ndid not. (For accounts of moral remainders as they relate specifically\nto Kantianism and virtue ethics, see, respectively, Hill 1996,\n183\u2013187 and Hursthouse 1999, 44\u201348 and 68\u201377.)\n\nWith remorse or guilt, at least two components are present: the\nexperiential component, namely, the negative feeling that the\nagent has; and the cognitive component, namely, the belief\nthat the agent has done something wrong and takes responsibility for\nit. Although this same cognitive component is not part of regret, the\nnegative feeling is. And the experiential component alone cannot serve\nas a gauge to distinguish regret from remorse, for regret can range\nfrom mild to intense, and so can remorse. In part, what distinguishes\nthe two is the cognitive component. But now when we examine the case\nof an alleged dilemma, such as that of Sartre\u2019s student, it is\nquestion-begging to assert that it is appropriate for him to\nexperience remorse no matter what he does. No doubt, it is appropriate\nfor him to experience some negative feeling. To say, however,\nthat it is remorse that is called for is to assume that the agent\nappropriately believes that he has done something wrong. Since regret\nis warranted even in the absence of such a belief, to assume that\nremorse is appropriate is to assume, not argue, that the\nagent\u2019s situation is genuinely dilemmatic. Opponents of dilemmas\ncan say that one of the requirements overrides the other, or that the\nagent faces a disjunctive requirement, and that regret is appropriate\nbecause even when he does what he ought to do, some bad will ensue.\nEither side, then, can account for the appropriateness of some\nnegative moral emotion. To get more specific, however, requires more\nthan is warranted by the present argument. This appeal to moral\nresidue, then, does not by itself establish the reality of moral\ndilemmas.\n\nMatters are even more complicated, though, as the second objection to\nthe argument from moral residue shows. The residues contemplated by\nproponents of the argument are diverse, ranging from guilt or remorse\nto a belief that the agent ought to apologize or compensate persons\nwho were negatively impacted by the fact that he did not satisfy one\nof the conflicting obligations. The argument assumes that experiencing\nremorse or guilt or believing that one ought to apologize or\ncompensate another are appropriate responses only if the agent\nbelieves that he has done something wrong. But this assumption is\ndebatable, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirst, even when one obligation clearly overrides another in a\nconflict case, it is often appropriate to apologize to or to explain\noneself to any disadvantaged parties. Ross provides such a case (1930,\n28): one who breaks a relatively trivial promise in order to assist\nsomeone in need should in some way make it up to the promisee. Even\nthough the agent did no wrong, the additional actions promote\nimportant moral values (McConnell 1996, 42\u201344).\n\nSecond, as Simon Blackburn argues, compensation or its like may be\ncalled for even when there was no moral conflict at all (Blackburn\n1996, 135\u2013136). If a coach rightly selected Agnes for the team\nrather than Belinda, she still is likely to talk to Belinda, encourage\nher efforts, and offer tips for improving. This kind of \u201cmaking\nup\u201d is just basic decency.\n\nThird, the consequences of what one has done may be so horrible as to\nmake guilt inevitable. Consider the case of a middle-aged man, Bill,\nand a seven-year-old boy, Johnny. It is set in a midwestern village on\na snowy December day. Johnny and several of his friends are riding\ntheir sleds down a narrow, seldom used street, one that intersects\nwith a busier, although still not heavily traveled, street. Johnny, in\nhis enthusiasm for sledding, is not being very careful. During his\nfinal ride he skidded under an automobile passing through the\nintersection and was killed instantly. The car was driven by Bill.\nBill was driving safely, had the right of way, and was not exceeding\nthe speed limit. Moreover, given the physical arrangement, it would\nhave been impossible for Bill to have seen Johnny coming. Bill was not\nat fault, legally or morally, for Johnny\u2019s death. Yet Bill\nexperienced what can best be described as remorse or guilt about his\nrole in this horrible event (McConnell 1996, 39).\n\nAt one level, Bill\u2019s feelings of remorse or guilt are not\nwarranted. Bill did nothing wrong. Certainly Bill does not deserve to\nfeel guilt (Dahl 1996, 95\u201396). A friend might even recommend\nthat Bill seek therapy. But this is not all there is to say. Most of\nus understand Bill\u2019s response. From Bill\u2019s point of view,\nthe response is not inappropriate, not irrational, not uncalled-for.\nTo see this, imagine that Bill had had a very different response.\nSuppose that Bill had said, \u201cI regret Johnny\u2019s death. It\nis a terrible thing. But it certainly was not my fault. I have nothing\nto feel guilty about and I don\u2019t owe his parents any\napologies.\u201d Even if Bill is correct intellectually, it is hard\nto imagine someone being able to achieve this sort of objectivity\nabout his own behavior. When human beings have caused great harm, it\nis natural for them to wonder if they are at fault, even if to\noutsiders it is obvious that they bear no moral responsibility for the\ndamage. Human beings are not so finely tuned emotionally that when\nthey have been causally responsible for harm, they can easily\nturn guilt on or off depending on their degree of moral\nresponsibility. (See Zimmerman 1988, 134\u2013135.)\n\nWork in moral psychology can help to explain why self-directed moral\nemotions like guilt or remorse are natural when an agent has acted\ncontrary to a moral norm, whether justifiably or not. Many moral\npsychologists describe dual processes in humans for arriving at moral\njudgments (see, for example, Greene 2013, especially Chapters\n4\u20135, and Haidt 2012, especially Chapter 2). Moral emotions are\nautomatic, the brain\u2019s immediate response to a situation. Reason\nis more like the brain\u2019s manual mode, employed when automatic\nsettings are insufficient, such as when norms conflict. Moral emotions\nare likely the product of evolution, reinforcing conduct that promotes\nsocial harmony and disapproving actions that thwart that end. If this\nis correct, then negative moral emotions are apt to be experienced, to\nsome extent, any time an agent\u2019s actions are contrary to what is\nnormally a moral requirement.\n\nSo both supporters and opponents of moral dilemmas can give an account\nof why agents who face moral conflicts appropriately experience\nnegative moral emotions. But there is a complex array of issues\nconcerning the relationship between ethical conflicts and moral\nemotions, and only book-length discussions can do them justice.
