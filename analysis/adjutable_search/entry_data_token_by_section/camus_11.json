    "main_text": "Camus and the World of Violence: The Rebel || Violence: Inevitable and Impossible\n4.3 Violence: Inevitable and Impossible\n\nThe concluding chapters of The Rebel are punctuated with\nemphatic words of conclusion (alors, donc,\nainsi, c\u2019est pourquoi), which are rarely\nfollowed by consequences of what comes before and often introduce\nfurther assertions, without any evidence or analysis. They are studded\nwith carefully composed topic sentences for major ideas\u2014which\none expects to be followed by paragraphs, pages, and chapters of\ndevelopment but, instead, merely follow one another and wait until the\nnext equally well-wrought topic sentence.\n\nAs often in the book, the reader must be prepared to follow an\nabstract dance of concepts, as \u201crebellion,\u201d\n\u201crevolution,\u201d \u201chistory,\u201d\n\u201cnihilism,\u201d and other substantives stand on their own,\nwithout reference to human agents. The going gets even muddier as we\nnear the end and the text verges on incoherence. How then is it\npossible that Foley judges The Rebel philosophically as\nCamus\u2019s \u201cmost important book\u201d (Foley 55)?\n\nIn these pages Camus is going back over familiar ground, contrasting\nthe implicit religiosity of a future-oriented outlook that claims to\nunderstand and promote the logic of history, and justifying violence\nto implement it, with his more tentative \u201cphilosophy of\nlimits,\u201d with its sense of risk, \u201ccalculated\nignorance,\u201d and living in the present. However the strain stems\nfrom the fact that he is doing so much more. As he tries to bring the\nbook to a conclusion he is wrestling with its most difficult\ntheme\u2014that the resort to violence is both inevitable and\n\u201cimpossible.\u201d The rebel lives in contradiction. He or she\ncannot abandon the possibility of lying, injustice, and violence, for\nthey are part of the rebel\u2019s condition, and will of necessity\nenter into the struggle against oppression. \u201cHe cannot,\ntherefore, absolutely claim not to kill or lie, without renouncing his\nrebellion and accepting, once and for all, evil and murder.\u201d In\nother words, to not rebel is to become an accomplice of oppression.\nRebellion, Camus has insisted, will entail murder. Yet rebellion,\n\u201cin principle,\u201d is a protest against death, just as it is\na source of the solidarity that binds the human community. He has said\nthat death is the most fundamental of absurdities, and that at root\nrebellion is a protest against absurdity. Thus to kill any other human\nbeing, even an oppressor, is to disrupt our solidarity, in a sense to\ncontradict our very being. It is impossible, then, to embrace\nrebellion while rejecting violence.\n\nThere are those, however, who ignore the dilemma: these are the\nbelievers in history, heirs of Hegel and Marx who imagine a time when\ninequality and oppression will cease and humans will finally be happy.\nFor Camus such a hope resembles the paradise beyond this life promised\nby religions. Living for, and sacrificing humans to, a supposedly\nbetter future is, very simply, another religion. Moreover, his\nsharpest hostility is reserved for intellectuals who theorize and\njustify such movements. Accepting the dilemma, Camus is unable to\nspell out how a successful revolution can remain committed to the\nsolidaristic and life-affirming principle of rebellion with which it\nbegan. He does however suggest two actions which, if implemented,\nwould be signs of a revolution\u2019s commitment to remain\nrebellious: it would abolish the death penalty and it would encourage\nrather than restrict freedom of speech.\n\nIn The Rebel Camus extends the ideas he asserted in\nNuptials, developed in The Myth of Sisyphus, and\nthen foreshadowed in The Plague: the human condition is\ninherently frustrating, indeed absurd, but we betray ourselves and\nsolicit catastrophe by seeking solutions beyond our capacity.\n\u201cThe rebel obstinately confronts a world condemned to death and\nthe impenetrable obscurity of the human condition with his demand for\nlife and absolute clarity. He is seeking, without knowing it, a moral\nphilosophy or a religion\u201d (R, 101). The book sets out\nthe alternative: to accept the fact that we are living in a Godless\nuniverse and rebel against this within limits as do most of the\nmembers of the \u201csanitary squads\u201d in The Plague\n\u2013 or to become a revolutionary, who, like the religious believer\ncommitted to the abstract and total triumph of justice, refuses to\naccept living in the present.\n\nHaving critiqued religion in Nuptials and The\nPlague, Camus is self-consciously exploring the starting points,\nprojects, weaknesses, illusions, and political temptations of a\npost-religious universe. He describes how traditional religion has\nlost its force, and how younger generations have been growing up amid\nan increasing emptiness and a sense that anything is possible. He\nfurther claims that modern secularism stumbles into a nihilistic state\nof mind because it does not really free itself from religion.\n\u201cThen the only kingdom that is opposed to the kingdom of grace\nmust be founded-namely, the kingdom of justice-and the human community\nmust be reunited among the debris of the fallen City of God. To kill\nGod and to build a church are the constant and contradictory purpose\nof rebellion\u201d (R, 103). If rebellion spills over its\nlimits and is given free rein, our modern need to create kingdoms and\nour continuing search for salvation is the path of catastrophe.\n\u201cWhen the throne of God is overturned, the rebel realizes that\nit is now his own responsibility to create the justice, the order, and\nthe unity that he sought in vain within his own condition, and in this\nway to justify the fall of God. Then begins the desperate effort to\ncreate, at the price of crime and murder if necessary, the dominion of\nman\u201d (R, 25). But to restrain oneself from this effort\nis to feel bereft of justice, order, and unity. Camus recognizes that\nhope and the revolutionary drive are essential directions of the\npost-classical Western spirit, stemming from its entire world of\nculture, thought, and feeling. This is the path of the metaphysical\nrebel, who does not see that \u201chuman insurrection, in its exalted\nand tragic forms, is only, and can only be, a prolonged protest\nagainst death\u201d (R, 100).\n",
