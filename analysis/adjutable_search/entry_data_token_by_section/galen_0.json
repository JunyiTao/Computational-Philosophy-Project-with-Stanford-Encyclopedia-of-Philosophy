    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\nGalen was born into the intellectual and social elite of the culturally Greek city of Pergamon, near the northwest coast of Roman Asia, in present-day Turkey, in 129 CE, the son of an architect. (Further on his biography and intellectual background see Nutton 1973; Gill et al. 2009; Boudon-Millot 2013; Mattern 2013; Singer 2019a.) He lays great stress on his own early education in mathematics and geometry, and on his passion for logic (Lib. Prop. 14/11; Aff. Pecc. Dig. I.8), seeing these disciplines as providing a model of secure proof lacking from the philosophical debates of the post-Hellenistic schools which were dominant in his day, as well as an antidote to the lures of Skepticism. From the age of fourteen he embarked on his formal education in philosophy. This involved attendance at the closely text-based lecture courses of professors of one or more of the four established philosophical schools: Platonist, Aristotelian, Stoic, Epicurean: Galen mentions an adherent of each as part of his early education. (On Galen\u2019s philosophical eclecticism see Donini 1992; Hankinson 1992.) From the age of sixteen he also commenced his medical studies, although study of philosophy continued concurrently. After his father\u2019s death in 149 he undertook an educational journey of several years, involving periods in Smyrna, Corinth and Alexandria, to study with the foremost medical teachers of the time. This study also involved a strong textual element. Alexandria retained its status as a centre for anatomical research and teaching (although dissection at this period was restricted to non-human animals), but also for scholarship on \u201cclassical\u201d texts. It seems likely that it was here that Galen acquired his in-depth training both in anatomy (von Staden 1992; Grmek and Gourevitch 1994) and in the tradition and practice of commentary on texts of his predecessors, those of the \u201cHippocratic\u201d corpus in particular, which became a central element in his writing and in his intellectual self-positioning (Lloyd 1993; von Staden 1997, 2009; Manetti and Roselli 1994; Singer 1996, 2021a; Vegetti 1999).\nIn 157 he returned to his home city, taking up an official post as doctor to the gladiators, before moving to Rome in the early 160s, where\u2014after one more brief period back in Pergamon\u2014he settled permanently. At Rome Galen seems to have developed his status very quickly amongst the socio-intellectual elite\u2014which significantly included devotees of philosophy, in particular Aristotelians (Singer 2014). He soon shone as a self-publicizing medical practitioner; he also gave public lectures and anatomical demonstrations in a highly competitive intellectual environment (see Lib. Prop. 1; Praen. 4\u20135; Barton 1994; von Staden 1995, 1997; Mattern 2008; Gleason 2009; Salas 2020). Much of his anatomical work, as well as the inception of two great works central to the establishment of his reputation, The Function of the Parts of the Body (UP) and The Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato (PHP), belongs to this early period. The former text aims to establish the purposive, indeed divine, construction, understood in relation to its particular function (chreia), of every anatomical feature of the body (see further section 5 below), and explicitly models itself on Aristotelian biological work. The latter constitutes both an exposition of Platonic tripartite psychology, with a vigorous polemic against the Stoic monist alternative, and a synthesis of this Platonic view with Galen\u2019s physiology of brain, heart and liver (see further below, section 7); it contains an account of the famous experiment whereby the function of the brain\u2014in Galen\u2019s terms, the fact that it is the seat of the \u201cleading-part\u201d of the soul\u2014is demonstrated by ligation of the spinal cord of a live pig.\nAdopted as court physician by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (who ruled 161\u201380), Galen was also fortunate to be left in Rome during the emperor\u2019s lengthy military campaign in central Europe; to this period (169\u201376), indeed, he ascribes the writing-up of a large number of his major works in scientific and medical theory (Lib. Prop. 3).\nGalen\u2019s court career apparently continued through the reigns of Marcus\u2019 successors, Commodus (180\u201392) and Septimius Severus (193\u2013211); this later phase of his career includes some of his major medical writings, including the completion of the magnum opus The Method of Healing (MM), as well as the production of much of his extremely voluminous series of works on drugs, and equally voluminous body of commentaries on Hippocrates (together constituting nearly half his extant output). Galen lived through both Commodus\u2019 notorious reign of terror and a disastrous fire, in 192, in which he lost a substantial personal library: both experiences are described in a recently-discovered ethical work, Avoiding Distress (Ind.), which also adds to our knowledge of his extraordinary scholarly activity, including not least his work on the Aristotelian tradition (see Petit 2019). It is possible, but not certain, that Galen\u2019s extant ethical writings should also be dated to this later phase of his life (after 192). Towards the end of his life, certainly, he wrote a \u201cphilosophical testament\u201d, My Own Doctrines (Prop. Plac.), which gives a concise but important insight into his attitudes to a range of philosophical questions (see below, \u00a73.4).\nGalen amassed a large fortune, including a second home in Campania; he must have had considerable intellectual influence on medical life at Rome, although such influence is not attested until a considerably later period. The traditional date of his death is around 200, but some later sources suggest that he was still alive more than ten years after this (Nutton 1984).\n",
