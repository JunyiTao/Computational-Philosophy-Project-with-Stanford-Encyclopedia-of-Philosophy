One common\nclassification of the divine attributes was into (1) essential\nproperties or attributes (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-dh\u0101t) and\n(2) properties of action (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-fi\u02bfl).\nEssential properties in turn are divided into negative\n(salb\u012b) properties and \u2018properties of\nma\u02bfn\u012b\u2019, that is, properties with a positive\n(thub\u016bt\u012b) meaning, and so add some further sense to\nwhat it is to be God. Negative properties indicate God\u2019s\ntranscendence and include unity, eternity (qidam), permanence\n(baq\u0101\u02be), self-subsistence (qiy\u0101m bi\nnafsihi), dissimilarity to the creation (mukh\u0101lafa\nli-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith) and one may also include simplicity,\nalthough it is not usually included in the list. This list consists of\n\u2018formal properties\u2019 in the sense that they do not indicate\nany perfection per se but an absence of limitations on God,\ne.g., non-temporal, immutable and non-dependent (Burrell 1986:\n46\u201350). In general, all of these negative properties express a\ndissimilarity to creation, since each one of them indicates how God is\nnot like creation in a certain respect. The positive\nproperties (properties of ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) include\npower (qudra), will (ir\u0101da), knowledge\n(\u02bfilm), life (\u1e25ay\u0101t), speech\n(kal\u0101m), hearing (sam\u02bf) and sight\n(ba\u1e63ar). Properties of action include creation and the\nconservation of the universe, commanding, determining what happens\n(qadar) in the universe, etc. Positive properties and\nproperties of action imply some similarity to creation. One may add as\nanother sub-category of properties found in the Qur\u2019an those\nthat necessarily imply similarity with creaturely existence, like\nhaving a face, eyes, being seated, etc. In general later Muslim\ntheologians and philosophers understood this last set of properties\nmetaphorically. How to understand the sense and status of the divine\nessential properties with a positive meaning, however, remained an\nimportant problem for medieval Muslim scholars. The three most\nprominent and developed views were those of the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians, the Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians and the\nphilosophers. Let us consider each school in turn.\n6.2.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites and theological language\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians strongly emphasized both God\u2019s\ndissimilarity to creation and his absolute oneness or simplicity. They\nask one to consider the properties or perfections found in humans and\nalso attributed to God, like, knowledge, power and will. As these\nproperties exist in humans there is a distinction between the thing\nthat possesses the perfections and the perfections themselves. Is the\nsame true of God? The answer for the Mu\u02bftazilites is a resounding\n\u2018no!\u2019 That is because if the divine attributes are\ndistinct from the divine self, then there would be a multiplicity of\ndivine, eternal entities, namely, the eternal and divine subject of\nattribution and the eternal and divine attributes. Consequently, they\nconclude, divine oneness and unity is lost and indeed one sinks into a\nform of polytheism far from the monotheism of Islam, a position that\nthe Mu\u02bftazilites found wholly untenable. For Mu\u02bftazilites,\nthe relation between God\u2019s self and his attributes must be\neither one of negation (salb), namely, to deny that God is in\nany way limited in the way creatures are, or one of identity, namely,\nthe divine attributes are not distinct from the divine self that bears\nthose attributes.\n\nIn the case of interpreting divine attributes as negations,\nMu\u02bftazilites modified a version of the earlier Muslim\napophaticists. For instance, to say that \u201cGod is knowing\u201d,\nmeans that God is not ignorant\u201d, or to say that \u201cGod is\npowerful\u201d means that \u201cGod is not weak or not\npowerless\u201d. The rest of the divine attributes are interpreted\nalong the same lines (Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201377, 183\u20135\n& 486 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 182\u2013213). Such\nattributions are helpful in understanding and speaking about God in\njust they way that eliminating possible choices from a multiple-choice\nquestion is helpful. One with such negative knowledge is certainly in\na better position than one who does not possesses it or is merely\nguessing or who wrongly believes that they know what is true.\nMoreover, informative, negative ascriptions do not require assigning\nto God a plurality of distinct positive properties, which in fact are\nmore fitting of creatures. Thus, in the case of negative ascriptions,\nboth God\u2019s transcendence and simplicity are safeguarded.\n\nAs for identifying God\u2019s self and attributes, Mu\u02bftazilites\nbegan by acknowledging that human language cannot avoid distinguishing\na subject and the properties predicated of that subject, and indeed\nthe Qur\u2019an addresses humans in human language. This feature is a\nlimit of human language and our cognitive capacities but not of God.\nIn the case of God, there is an identity of the subject and\nperfections predicated of the divine subject, even though human\nthinking and speaking cannot avoid distinguishing these as separate\n(Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201385 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK:\n182\u2013213). Unfortunately, identifying the divine properties of\nperfection with God Himself is not as simple as it might first appear.\nIf divine properties are identical to God, then they must be identical\nto each other, and yet, for example, despite adages to the contrary,\nknowledge seems to be truly distinct from power. Additionally, if God\nis identical to his properties, God would be a property, which hardly\nseems like an object worthy of worship (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nIncoherence, discs. 5\u20136; cf. Plantinga 1980:\n26\u201361 and McGinnis 2022).\n\nOne Mu\u02bftazilite response to this objection was that of Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101shim al-Jubb\u0101\u02be\u012b (d. 933). In order to\nexplain, both why and how identifying positive properties with God\ndoes not lead to these absurdities, he argued that such properties are\nlike states (a\u1e25w\u0101l) of an entity\u2014e.g.,\nsitting\u2014which can differ depending upon how one considers them.\nThus, if a state is taken on its own, it does not really exist out\nthere\u2014there is no \u2018sitting\u2019 that exists out there\nsimply as sitting. Still, the fact that a state as some independent\nproperty does not exist out there does not mean that it is an\nabsolutely non-existent; rather, it exists by virtue of the existence\nof the entity in that state. Thus, to say that \u201cGod is\nknowing\u201d is to indicate a certain state of God and to say that\n\u201cGod is powerful\u201d is to indicate another state of God, yet\nin neither case, does the state indicate what God himself is\n(\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 128\u20139; also see Schmidtke 2016a:\n162\u20134).\n6.2.2 Ash\u02bfarites/Maturidites and theological language\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians accused the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians of all the problems following upon identifying the divine\nself and its attributes implies, such as the loss of distinction among\nthe divine attributes and that ultimately God would be identical with\na property. In opposition to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the Ash\u02bfarite\nand Maturidite theologians affirmed the distinction between the\npositive divine attributes, like knowledge, power and will, and God as\nthe bearer of those attributes. Thus, the problem facing them was to\nexplain how a multiplicity of divine things, and so a violation of\ndivine oneness, does not ensue if God\u2019s self and his distinct\nproperties of perfection are all divine and eternal.\n\nThey adopted two main strategies to address this problem. One early\nstrategy was to argue that properties predicated of God with some\npositive connotation\u2014properties that are not simply\nnegations\u2014are neither different from nor identical to the divine\nself. One challenge to such a view is that it seems to violate the Law\nof Excluded Middle, for a divine attribute must either be identical to\nthe divine self or not identical to it, in which case it would be\ndifferent from the divine self. Two early Ash\u02bfarite theologians,\nB\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b and Juwayn\u012b, apparently tried to adopt\nthe Mu\u02bftazilite theory of states to address this concern.\nConsidered in themselves, the divine attributes are not identical to\nGod, while considered relative to God\u2019s possession of those\nattributes they are identical to God (Shahrast\u0101n\u012b\nal-Milal, I 82 & Summa, 52\u201360; F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b Opinions, 61\u20134 and\nTaft\u0101z\u0101n\u012b Creed, 51\u20135).\n\nAnother way that Ash\u02bfarites and Maturidites attempted to observe\ndivine transcendence while upholding the meaningfulness of theological\nlanguage was to emphasize that when an attribute is predicated of God,\n\u201cGod is not like others that have that attribute\u201d. For\nexample, al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b, in his Kit\u0101b\nal-Taw\u1e25\u012bd, begins by criticizing the anthropomorphic\nposition by indicating certain shortcomings of conceiving God in a\nmanner similar to creation (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 43\u20137;\nalso see Rudolph 1996 [2015: 282\u20134]). He then explains how God\nis unlike creation. When properties predicated of creation are\npredicated of God, they are used in such a way that all the creaturely\nimplications are stripped off; they are, as it were, a \u2018winnowed\nconcept\u2019 (cf. Alston 1985). He also acknowledges that in order\nto know God, we must use the language that is used to talk about\ncreatures. Accordingly, we predicate perfections of God, but take into\naccount the principle that God is unlike creatures. For example, one\nmay say \u201cGod knows but His knowledge is unlike, knowledge\nbelonging to creatures\u201d. This way of predicating attributes of\nGod also found supporters among Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, like\n\u02bfAbd al-Jabbar, who offers and defends the same strategy and\nformula. The strategy, however, has its challenges, for if one\ninterprets \u2018unlike\u2019 in the strict sense, theological\nlanguage seems to lose its informative function, while if it is not\ntaken in a strict sense, it is not clear that divine transcendence is\nsecured.\n6.2.3 Philosophers and theological language\n\nTo varying degrees most, if not all, philosophers accepted some form\nof a negative theology when discussing the divine attributes\n(Kind\u012b PWK: \u201cOn First Philosophy\u201d, \u00a7\u00a7\nXIX\u2013XX; F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, ch. 1; and\nAvicenna MetaH: 8.4). For them, many, if not all, of the attributes\nascribed to God are in fact merely descriptions of ways that God is\nunlimited or infinite in some respect or other. The\nphilosophers\u2019 general strategy is the same as the\nMu\u02bftazilites (see\n \u00a76.2.1),\n where the basic idea, again, is that negative ascriptions, while\ninformative, do not involve God\u2019s necessarily possessing a\nplurality of positive attributes, which would jeopardize both divine\nsimplicity and God\u2019s transcendence.\n\nCertain philosophers, like Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd, likewise\nrepeated the Mu\u02bftazilite position that the divine self is\nidentical with its essential attributes, like life, knowledge and\npower (Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t, 264 = MR07: 214 & MetaH:\n1.7 & 8.4 and Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 299\u2013301 [1954:\n177\u20139]). Ibn Rushd notes that in a limited sense this\nidentification of some entity with its essential attributes is true\neven of creatures. He provides the example of the definition of\n\u2018man\u2019 as a \u2018rational animal\u2019. Both rationality\nand animality are parts of the definition of \u2018man\u2019, but\nthey are not distinct parts constituting the flesh-and-blood man in\nthe world in the way that color and shape are. This analogy is not to\nsuggest that one can have a definition of God, which Ibn Rushd flatly\ndenies, but only to indicate that the way humans conceive an entity\nneeds not perfectly reflect how that entity exists in the world.\nIndeed, Ibn Rushd goes further and provides a principled Aristotelian\nreason why no creature could ever form a definition of God or fully\ngrasp the divinity (Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 345\u20136 [1954:\n207]). He notes that according to Aristotelian principles to grasp\nwhat a thing is essentially, so as to be able to have a definition,\nrequires that in some sense the intellect becomes the very thing\ngrasped. Thus, since a finite human intellect can never grasp the\ninfinite\u2014indeed, to whatever extent it does grasp it, the very\nact of grasping it limits it so that it is finite in the human\nintellect\u2014it can never form a definition of God nor fully grasp\nGod\u2019s essential existence. Thus, by necessity the human\nintellect conceives a plurality of attributes in its conception of God\nwhere in fact none exists. Admittedly, this discussion comes from one\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s popular works and not from one intended solely\nfor the philosophers, and so whether it presents his considered view\non the subject remains unclear. As for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, he is more\nforthcoming, arguing that all the various (positive) essential\nattributes said of God really are nothing more than alternative\ndescriptions of a single reality, namely, necessary existence through\nitself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi), which is\nidentical with and unique to God.\n7. Ethics in Islam\n\nIn addition to the role of reason in justifying specific ethical\njudgments like what is morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn\nwa-l-qub\u1e25)\u2014a discussion that mirrors those about\nreason and faith in Islam more generally\n (\u00a71.2)\u2014Muslim\n thinkers also were concerned with the ontological status of normative\nproperties, like goodness and badness (see Emon 2010). With respect to\nthis issue, one asks whether ethical facts exist independently of God\nor do they originate from and have their morally binding force as a\nresult of a divine command. On the one hand, if the demands of morally\ngood and bad actions are independent of God, then is God subject to\nthose demands or not? If so, then does God observe them as a matter of\nnecessity, in which case God\u2019s power seems limited, or does he\nobserve them as a matter of will or choice, in which case were he not\nto observe them would he be morally bad, since again these demands\ndetermine morally good and bad actions? On the other hand, if ethical\ndicta have their source and force in God\u2019s commanding them,\ncould God have commanded contrary to what he did and so invert right\nand wrong? For example, could God have commanded us to lie, in which\ncase lying would have been obligatory and even morally good?\n7.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites on the morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn wa-l-qub\u1e25)\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians defended the view that reason can acquire\na knowledge of what is morally right and wrong, precisely because\nstandards of right and wrong are purportedly objective and not\narbitrary, and so are independent of God\u2019s merely commanding\nthem. Their views are laid out within the context of moral\nresponsibility (see Hourani 1971 & 1985 and Vasalou 2008). For\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians, while perhaps reason cannot discover all\nof those actions for which one is religiously responsible in order to\nbe a devout Muslim (such as praying five times daily or avoiding\npork), one could come to know the more general ethical human\nresponsibilities (such as avoiding lying and honoring one\u2019s\nbenefactor). This is because according to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the\nproperties that make an action good or bad, and for which one is\nmorally responsible, are objective qualities relative to the action,\nto the consequence(s) of the action or to the agent of the action.\nThese moral properties are objective precisely because we\nobserve\u2014whether through self-reflection or inference from the\noutward behavior of others\u2014the benefit or the harm that an\naction causes. Thus, in a consequentialist vein, these\nMu\u02bftazilites relate the morally good with what is genuinely\nbeneficial and the morally bad with what is harmful. Religion then\nconfirms what reason knows about the moral status of an action and its\nconsequence(s).\n\nSince for these thinkers the ethical status of an action does not\ndepend on a divine command, the question arises whether God is bound\nto behave ethically. \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r argued that ethical\ndemands are binding and applicable not only to human agents but also\nto God and his action as well (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r\nal-Ta\u02bfd\u012bl: 52\u201370). Thus, he argues that if\none denies that God is bound to do and to command the morally good,\nthe commands and prohibitions given in scripture would be not only\narbitrary but possibly even mutable and unreliable. For example, if\none allowed that God could lie, then God or the prophets could be\nlying about what is required for salvation or what leads to damnation,\nin which case all the religious teaching would be under suspicion, a\nposition which that \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r simply found\nunacceptable.\n7.2 Responses to the Mu\u02bftazilites\n\nMost medieval Muslim thinkers, whether philosophers, theologians or\nSufis, recognized some need for religion in order to possess a\ncomplete understanding of things ethical. Although they generally\ngranted that humans have some intuitive recognition of virtues and\nwhat is morally good and bad, they emphasized that various human\nconditions limit our ability always to judge correctly about the\nethical status of particular actions. One such limit is our inherent\ncognitive limits. Thus, the Sufi master Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b complains\nthat because the moral goodness or badness of actions may depend on\ncertain conditions that human reason cannot comprehended, divine\nrevelation is needed to inform us of the ethical status of our actions\n(Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b al-Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyya (b), I 459\u201360 & VII 326). For instance,\nwhat we \u2018observe\u2019 or judge to be a benefit may, all things\nconsidered, actually be harmful and similarly for our judgments about\nwhat is harmful. Only from a \u2018God\u2019s eye perspective\u2019\ncan one be assured that in fact all things have been considered. In\naddition to our inherent cognitive limits, personal and social\nconditions affect the reliability of our ethical judgments. For\nexample, the Sunni jurist, \u1e24ak\u012bm al-Tirmidh\u012b (d. ca.\n869), noted that while reason has some share in making sound moral\njudgments, selfishness and the human desire for material benefits and\npleasures hinders our ability always to reason correctly and\nobjectively about what is ethically right and wrong (Tirmidh\u012b\nKit\u0101b Ithb\u0101t al-\u02bfilal, 67\u201378).\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 identify yet another\nhuman condition that requires religion to aid reason in determining\nright ethical rules. They maintained that ethical and political\njudgments are not a priori necessary truths, but well-known\nand commonly accepted specific rules\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl\u0101t) acquired from attending to various\npractices over long periods of time. Thus, without knowing this\nsocio-cultural history that religion preserves, one cannot know what\nis efficacious for living a good and virtuous life here on earth\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, 77\u20138 and Avicenna\nMetaH: 10.2\u20134; also see Erlwein 2019).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians in general vehemently\ncriticized the Mu\u02bftazilite position that reason alone can\ndiscover even general ethical demands incumbent upon humans and God\nalike. Their criticisms highlight the unacceptable theological\nimplications of the Mu\u02bftazilite position and the inherent limits\nof human reason. The most common criticism comes from the theological\nimplication that God is compelled or obligated to do the good. Recall\nthat the general Mu\u02bftazilite position, as \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r articulated it, holds that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions regardless of their agents, and so since God is\ngood, God is morally compelled to do good. One obvious implication of\nthis view is that if God cannot do bad actions, then God\u2019s power\nis limited, and so God is not wholly omnipotent. From a theological\npoint of view, Ash\u02bfarite theologians found this implication\nunacceptable. Consequently, they denied that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions and instead demanded that all ethical standards\nare dependent on what God himself commands.\n\nAs for criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite position from the\nnature of human reason, Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidites theologians\navailed themselves of all the argument we have already seen about the\nlimits of our cognitive capacities and the constraints of our human\ncondition. Thus, for example, M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b presses the\npoint that while humans may have some inkling of general ethical\nprinciples and what is morally good and bad, these judgments are\nalways shaky given the frailty of our cognitive capacities.\nConsequently, religion is always needed to set our moral judgments on\nfirm ground (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 346\u201351).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite scholars also added further arguments to\nthe arsenal of criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite ethical theory.\nFor instance, in The Guide to Conclusive Proofs, Juwayn\u012b\nputs forth an account of the good and bad, which in certain ways\nanticipates the moral theory of David Hume seven hundred years later\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 141\u20136). The Mu\u02bftazilite\nposition rests on two key elements: (1) that some actions are either\ninherently and rationally good or bad and (2) the implicit assumption\nthat a rational agent must act in a rational way. Juwayn\u012b simply\ndenies that moral actions are inherently rational and that\nconsequently there is anything irrational when one does a good or bad\naction. To be sure, actions can be obligatory and praiseworthy or\nprohibited and blameworthy, but not rational. Instead, continues\nJuwayn\u012b, when through self-reflection or inference one recognizes\nthat certain actions are seemingly beneficial and others harmful, one\nmerely instinctually recognizes that those actions produce pleasure or\npain. It is the human\u2019s (and all animals\u2019) natural\ninstinct to seek pleasure and to avoid pain that motivates the action,\nnot some inherent rational property of the object that reason\ngrasps.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b likewise rejected the Mu\u02bftazilites\u2019\nposition, which he claimed rested upon an ambiguity in the meanings of\nthe terms \u2018good\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019 and\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 (w\u0101jib). For Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhen one says an action is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019,\nthose value judgments must be understood in terms of the intention or\npurpose relative to the agent or the one affected by the action. So\nunderstood, an action is good if it achieves the intended purpose and\nbad if it does not. While reason can direct and set one\u2019s\nintentions, so can imagination and estimation (wahm) as well\nas our passions and appetites. These latter faculty, however,\nfrequently fail to get at what is ultimately beneficial and harmful\nfor us, and so they fail to get at what an agent would intend all\nthings considered. Divine law provides precisely the\n\u2018all-things-considered\u2019 view.\n\nAs for human reason\u2019s determining what is morally incumbent upon\nGod, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b continues that since good and bad are related\nto the intentions of the agent, it is impossible for reason alone to\ndetermine whether God\u2019s actions are good or bad since we simply\ndo not know God\u2019s intentions independent of revelation. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b developed a similar defense (F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, 289\u2013304; also see\nShihadeh 2006 and 2021). Now instead of understanding good and bad\nrelative to an agent\u2019s intentions, Razi explains them in\nconsequentialist terms: Actions are good when, relative to the agent\nor one affected by the action, they are beneficial or pleasurable and\nbad when they are harmful or painful. Since God is in no need of\nbenefit and in no way can be pained, there is a sense in which his\nactions are simply beyond good and evil.\n\nIn light of their denial that there is any objective, God-independent\nstandard of right and wrong to which God is beholden, Ash\u02bfarites\nwere accused of undermining God\u2019s justice and making the\ngoodness or badness of actions arbitrary. That is because if there\nwere no limits to what God can morally command, then what God willed\nin the past to be good or bad, he could in the future will and so\ncommand to be contrariwise. Indeed, God may inflict pain on an\ninnocent for no reason whatsoever, and yet that action would be good\nprecisely because God commanded it. The Ash\u02bfarites were not\ninsensitive to this complaint. While both al-Juwayn\u012b and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b insist on God\u2019s absolute omnipotence and so\nGod\u2019s possibility to act arbitrarily, they also note that an\naction is only actually arbitrary if it is actually carried out, not\nif its occurrence is merely possible. Thus, a preferred Ash\u02bfarite\nresponse to the arbitrariness complaint was that the possibility of\nthe occurrence is not the occurrence of the possibility; God confirms\nvia revelation that he gives reward for good actions and he may punish\nonly those who do not fulfill what is decreed by revelation\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 157\u201364, 209\u201311 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 172\u201388).",
