    "main_text": "Ontology\n3. Ontology\n\nForemost among the technical terms of philosophy that Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee employs is wuj\u00fbd, existence or\nbeing, a word that had come to the center of philosophical discourse\nwith Avicenna. In its Koranic and everyday Arabic sense,\nwuj\u00fbd means to find, come across, become conscious of,\nenjoy, be ecstatic. It was used to designate existence because what\nexists is what is found and experienced. For Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nthe act of finding\u2014that is, perception, awareness, and\nconsciousness\u2014is never absent from the fact of being found. If\non the one hand he speaks of wuj\u00fbd in the standard\nAvicennan language of necessity and possibility, he simultaneously\ntalks of it\u2014in terms long established by the Sufi\ntradition\u2014as the fullness of divine presence and human\nconsciousness that is achieved in realization (Dobie 2007).\n\nAmong the Koranic divine names is \u201cLight\u201d\n(al-n\u00fbr), for God is \u201cthe light of the heavens\nand the earth\u201d (24:35). Naming God \u201cLight\u201d is\ntantamount to naming him Being, for, as Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee explains,\n\u201cTrue Light brings about perception but is not perceived\u201d,\njust as True Being brings about manifestation and finding but is\nneither manifest nor found. Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee continues by saying\nthat True Light is \u201cidentical with the Essence of the Real in\nrespect of Its disengagement from relations and attributions\u201d\n(Q\u00fbnaw\u00ee, al-Fuk\u00fbk, 225). In other words,\nTrue Light is Nondelimited Being (al-wuj\u00fbd al-mutlaq),\nand it discloses itself as delimited being (al-wuj\u00fbd\nal-muqayyad). It is precisely this Light that brings about\nfinding, awareness, and perception. Just as there is no true being but\nGod, so also there is no true finder but God and nothing truly found\nbut God. As Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee explains:\n\nWere it not for light, nothing whatsoever would be perceived\n[idr\u00e2k], neither the known, nor the sensed, nor the\nimagined. The names of light are diverse in keeping with the names of\nthe faculties\u2026. Smell, taste, imagination, memory, reason,\nreflection, conceptualization, and everything through which perception\ntakes place are light. As for the objects of perception\u2026 they\nfirst possess manifestation to the perceiver, then they are perceived;\nand manifestation is light\u2026. Hence every known thing has a\nrelation with the Real, for the Real is Light. It follows that nothing\nis known but God. (Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee,\nal-Fut\u00fbh\u00e2t, 1911 edition, 3:276\u201377)\n\n",
