Philosophical Themes\n\nLef\u00e8vre\u2019s place on the map of late medieval and\nRenaissance philosophy is difficult to pinpoint in a single key\ndoctrine or even a single work. He never composed his own synthetic or\nsystematic overview of philosophy. Nor did he write large commentaries\non select, individual questions, as did major university philosophers\nof the preceding centuries such as Jean Buridan or Paul of Venice. The\nfollowing themes thus represent more the state of current research\nthan a synoptic perspective on all Lef\u00e8vre\u2019s\nphilosophical positions.\n",
