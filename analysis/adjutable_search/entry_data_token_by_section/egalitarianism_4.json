    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Karl Marx on Equal Rights\n3.2 Karl Marx on Equal Rights\n\n\nThe Marxian tradition in political and economic thought urges the\ndesirability of eliminating some of the inequalities associated with\nthe institutions of a capitalist market economy. Interpreting Karl\nMarx as an egalitarian normative theorist is a tricky undertaking,\nhowever, in view of the fact that he tends to eschew explicit\nnormative theorizing on moral principles and to regard assertions of\nmoral principles as so much ideological dust thrust in the eyes of the\nworkers by defenders of capitalism. Marx does, of course, have an\nelaborate empirical theory of the evolution of moral principles\ncorresponding to changes in the economic mode of production.\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Critique of the Gotha Program,\u201d Marx asserts that in the first\nphase of communist society the economy will distribute goods according\nto the norm, to each according to his labor contribution.  This norm\ncan be regarded as defining an equal right, but like any such right,\nit is defective. One defect is that some individuals are naturally\nmore able than others, and so the amount of one's labor contribution\nwill vary depending on factors that vary by luck beyond one's power to\ncontrol. For this and other reasons Marx asserts it will be desirable\nto discard this norm when a higher phase of communist society is\nattained. Then society can move beyond the sphere of bourgeois right\naltogether and operate according to the norm, from each according to\nhis ability, to each according to his needs. Despite Marx's\ndisclaimer, he seems to be proposing a principle of equal right: Each\nhas the right to receive economic goods that satisfy her needs to the\nsame extent provided she contributes to the economy according to her\nability. But Marx would resist the description of this norm as a\nprinciple of justice or moral rights. One consideration in his mind\nmay be that moral rights ought to be enforced, but when it is feasible\nand desirable to implement higher-phase communist distribution, the\nimplementation can be carried out successfully without any legal or\ninformal coercion, and hence should not occur through any process of\nsocial enforcement. Or so Marx thinks. (See Marx 1978, Wood 1981,\nCohen, G., 1988 and 1995.)\n",
