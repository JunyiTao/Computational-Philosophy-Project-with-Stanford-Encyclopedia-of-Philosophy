Schlegel\n\nAugust Wilhelm Schlegel was son of Johanna Christiane Erdmuthe\nSchlegel (n\u00e9e H\u00fcbsh) and Johann Adolf Schlegel, who was a\nLutheran clergyman and poet. He was born in September of 1767, in\nHanover. He initiated his studies at the University of G\u00f6ttingen\nin 1786, first in theology and later in classical philology and\naesthetics. It is also in G\u00f6ttingen that he first met Wilhelm von\nHumboldt and Caroline Michaelis (Caroline B\u00f6hmer after 1784), an\nintellectual and scholar who encouraged him and also participated in\nhis Shakespeare translations.  His youngest brother, Friedrich\nSchlegel, joined him in 1790. During this period, he was influenced by\nsome of his lecturers, such as Heyne, B\u00fcrger, and Eschenburg, and\nthe works of authors such as Johann Gottfried Herder (cf. Ewton 1972\nand H\u00f6lter 2010: 16\u201318). August Schlegel finished his\nstudies in 1791 and moved to Amsterdam where he worked until 1795 as a\nprivate teacher of Willem Ferdinand Mogge Muilman. In 1796 he moved to\nJena to work as a literary critic. His brother Friedrich also followed\nhim to Jena, and they both joined important artists and philosophers\nsuch as Novalis, Ludwig Tieck, Dorothea Schl\u00f6zer, and\nF.W.J. Schelling, thus forming the \u2018heart\u2019 of the so\ncalled Jena Romantik. In this same year, he married the widow\nCaroline B\u00f6hmer, whose role in A.W. Schlegel\u2019s translations\nof Shakespeare as well as other writings attributed solely to him\n(such as the dialogue Die Gem\u00e4lde, first published in\nthe Athenaeum in 1799) was much more\nimportant than has been acknowledged. In fact, as Ernst Behler claims,\nCaroline \u201chad a decisive influence upon the formulation of early\nRomantic theory\u201d (Behler 1993: 40).\n\nIn 1798, tired of the publishing difficulties endured within the\nexisting literary journals, A.W. Schlegel and his brother Friedrich\nSchlegel founded the famous periodical Athenaeum. They were\nboth the editors and the main writers of this journal, which would\noffer an alternative to mainstream classicist approaches in literary\ncriticism and which was soon to become one of the main outlets of the\nGerman Early Romantic Movement. The Athenaeum was devoted\nprimarily to literary criticism with a philological and historical\nperspective, and a large section of it featured the review of\ncontemporary literature. It contained critical essays, fragments,\nletters, announcements, and dialogues and appeared twice a year in the\nperiod between 1798 and 1800. Most importantly, though, the\nAthenaeum became the \u201cleading publication of the early\nRomantics\u201d (Behler 1993: 36).\n\nIn that same year, 1798, A.W. Schlegel started giving Lectures at the\nUniversity of Jena. He also continued his translation of the works of\nShakespeare (1797\u20131810), but on the whole his new involvement\nwith the university meant that his presence in the Athenaeum\nwould suffer, as did his marriage (Paulin 2016: 126). In 1801 Schlegel\nmoved alone to Berlin, where he also lectured on literature and art at\nthe University. Both his Jena (1798\u20131799) and his Berlin\nLectures (1801\u20131804) were highly didactic while at the same time\ninterspersed with important philosophical insights. So, as well as\nproviding a comprehensive vision of the history of European\nliterature, poetry, and mythology, Schlegel presented a new critical\nand philosophical (i.e., systematic) approach to art and its history.\nSome of these lectures were published in literary journals, until 1884\nwhen they were posthumously collected as Vorlesungen \u00fcber\nphilosophische Kunstlehere (Lectures on Philosophical Art\nEducation) and Vorlesungen \u00fcber sch\u00f6ne Literatur\nund Kunst (Lectures on Fine Art and Literature)\nrespectively. Four years later, in Vienna, Schlegel delivered another\nseries of lectures elaborating upon some of the ideas he had developed\nin his previous work. A literal transcription of these lectures was\npublished between 1809 and 1811 as Vorlesungen \u00fcber\ndramatische Kunst und Literatur (A Course of Lectures on\nDramatic Art and Literature). A more extended version of his\nCourse of Lectures was published in an 1816 edition: by that\ntime, they had already been translated into English, French, Dutch,\nand Italian and had obtained a wide circulation. Later Schlegel shows\nawareness of the fact that he was read \u201cnot only from Cadiz to\nSt. Petersburg, but in North America as well and even as far as\nAsia\u201d (Paulin 2016: 561). Indeed, the successful circulation of\nhis Vienna Lectures facilitated the dissemination of the fundamental\nideas underlying the Romantic Movement throughout Europe, and helped\nto solidify Schlegel\u2019s influence and reputation as a critic.\n\nAfter his divorce from Caroline Michaelis, who left him for his friend\nthe philosopher F.W.J. Schelling, Schlegel became Mme. de\nSta\u00ebl\u2019s constant companion on her travels in Germany,\nItaly, France, and Sweden until her death in 1817. He also was tutor\nof her children. In August 1818 he married Sophie Paulus in\nHeidelberg, but they only remained together for a few weeks. Sophie\nnever accompanied him to Bonn, where Schlegel was appointed Professor\nof Literature and Art History and lectured until 1844, a year before\nhis death.\n\nAlongside his academic work, A.W. Schlegel was a remarkably talented\ntranslator; he translated over 16 Shakespearean plays, five plays by\nCalder\u00f3n de la Barca, and selected pieces by Dante, Petrarch,\nGiovanni Boccaccio, Miguel de Cervantes, Torquato Tasso, and\nLu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, published in 1804 as\nBlumenstr\u00e4usse itali\u00e4nischer, spanischer, und\nportugiesischer Poesie, (Bouquets of Italian, Spanish, and\nPortuguese Poetry). He also made the first complete translation\nof the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 from Sanskrit into Latin, which\nhelped to promote and popularize the book in Germany (cf. Adluri and\nBagche 2014: 33f.).\n\nA.W. Schlegel can rightly be regarded as one of the first and most\nsignificant founders of Indology in Western Europe. Apart from his\ntranslations of Sanskrit texts, and the publishing the scholarly\njournal Indische Bibliothek (1820\u20131830), he set up a\nSanskrit printing press with which he provided the first printed\neditions of the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 (1823) and\nR\u0101m\u0101yana (1829) in continental Europe.\n",
