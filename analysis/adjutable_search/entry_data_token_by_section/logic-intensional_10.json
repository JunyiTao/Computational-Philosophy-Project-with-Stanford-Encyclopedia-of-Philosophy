    "main_text": "A Particular Intensional Logic || Adding Intensions\n3.3 Adding Intensions\n\n\nIn Section 3.2 a first order modal logic was sketched, in which\nquantification was over objects. Now a second kind of quantification\nis added, over intensions. As has been noted several times, an\nintensional object, or individual concept, will be modeled by a\nfunction from states to objects, but now we get into the question of\nwhat functions should be allowed. Intensions are supposed to be\nrelated to meanings. If we consider meaning to be a human construct,\nwhat constitutes an intension should probably be restricted. There\nshould not, for instance, be more intensional objects than there are\nsentences that can specify meanings, and this limits intensions to a\ncountable set. Or we might consider intensions as \u2018being\nthere,\u2019 and we pick out the ones that we want to think about, in\nwhich case cardinality considerations don\u2019t apply. This is an issue\nthat probably cannot be settled once and for all. Instead, the\nsemantics about to be presented allows for different choices in\ndifferent models\u2014it is not required that all functions from\nstates to objects be present. It should be noted that, while this\nsemantical gambit does have philosophical justification, it also makes\nan axiomatization possible. The fundamental point is the same as in\nthe move from first to second order logic. If we insist that second\norder quantifiers range over all sets and relations, an axiomatization\nis not possible. If we use Henkin models, in which the range of second\norder quantifiers has more freedom, an axiomatization becomes\navailable.\n\n\nFormulas are constructed more-or-less in the obvious way, with two\nkinds of quantified variables instead of one: extensional and\nintensional. But there is one really important addition to the\nsyntactic machinery, and it requires some discussion. Suppose we have\nan intension, \\(f\\), that picks out an object in each state. For\nexample, the states might be various ways the universe could have been\nconstituted, and at each state \\(f\\) picks out the number of the\nplanets which could, of course, be 0. Suppose \\(P\\) is a one-place\nrelation symbol\u2014what should be meant by \\(P(f)\\)?\nOn the one hand, it could mean that the intension \\(f\\) has the\nproperty \\(P\\), on the other hand it could mean that the object\ndesignated by \\(f\\) has the property \\(P\\). Both versions are\nuseful and correspond to things we say every day. We will allow for\nboth, but the second version requires some cleaning up. Suppose\n\\(P(f)\\) is intended to mean that the object designated\nby \\(f\\) (at a state) has property \\(P\\). Then how do we read\n\\(\\Diamond P(f)\\)? Under what circumstances should\nwe take it to be true at state \\(\\Gamma\\)? It could be understood as\nasserting the thing designated by \\(f\\) at \\(\\Gamma\\) (call it\n\\(f_{\\Gamma })\\) has the \u2018possible-\\(P\\)\u2019\nproperty, and so at some alternative state \\(\\Delta\\) we have that\n\\(f_{\\Gamma }\\) has property \\(P\\). This is the\nde re reading, in which a possible property is ascribed to a\nthing. Another way of understanding\n\\(\\Diamond P(f)\\) takes the possibility operator\nas primary: to say the formula is true at \\(\\Gamma\\) means that at some\nalternative state, \\(\\Delta\\), we have \\(P(f)\\), and so at\n\\(\\Delta\\) the object designated by \\(f\\) (call it\n\\(f_{\\Delta })\\) has property \\(P\\). This is the\nde dicto reading, possibility applies to a sentence. Of course\nthere is no particular reason why \\(f_{\\Gamma }\\) and\n\\(f_{\\Delta }\\) should be identical. The de re and\nde dicto readings are different, both need representation, and\nwe cannot manage this with the customary syntax.\n\n\nAn abstraction mechanism will be used to disambiguate our syntax. The\nde re reading will be symbolized\n\\([\\lambda x\\,\\Diamond P(x)](f)\\)\nand the de dicto will be symbolized\n\\(\\Diamond [\\lambda x\\,P(x)](f)\\). The\n(incomplete) expression \\([\\lambda x\\,X]\\) is\noften called a predicate abstraction; one can think of it as\nthe predicate abstracted from the formula \\(X\\). In\n\\([\\lambda x\\,\\Diamond P(x)](f)\\) we\nare asserting that \\(f\\) has the possible-\\(P\\) property,\nwhile in\n\\(\\Diamond [\\lambda x\\,P(x)](f)\\) we\nare asserting the possibility that \\(f\\) has the \\(P\\)\nproperty. Abstraction disambiguates. What we have said about \\(\\Diamond\\)\napplies equally well to \\(\\Box\\) of course. It should be noted that one\ncould simply think of abstraction as a scope-specifying device, in a\ntradition that goes back to Russell, who made use of such a mechanism\nin his treatment of definite descriptions. Abstraction in modal logic\ngoes back to Carnap 1947, but in a way that ignores the issues\ndiscussed above. The present usage comes from Stalnaker & Thomason\n1968 and Thomason & Stalnaker 1968.\n",
