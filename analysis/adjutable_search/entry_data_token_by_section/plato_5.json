Can we know Plato\u2019s mind?\n\nThis feature of Plato\u2019s works raises important questions about\nhow they are to be read, and has led to considerable controversy among\nthose who study his writings. Since he does not himself affirm\nanything in any of his dialogues, can we ever be on secure ground in\nattributing a philosophical doctrine to him (as opposed to one of his\ncharacters)? Did he himself have philosophical convictions, and can we\ndiscover what they were? Are we justified in speaking of \u201cthe\nphilosophy of Plato\u201d? Or, if we attribute some view to Plato\nhimself, are we being unfaithful to the spirit in which he intended\nthe dialogues to be read? Is his whole point, in refraining from\nwriting treatises, to discourage the readers of his works from asking\nwhat their author believes and to encourage them instead simply to\nconsider the plausibility or implausibility of what his characters are\nsaying? Is that why Plato wrote dialogues? If not for this reason,\nthen what was his purpose in refraining from addressing his\naudience in a more direct way (see Griswold 1988, Klagge and Smith\n1992, Press 2002)? There are other important questions about the\nparticular shape his dialogues take: for example, why does Socrates\nplay such a prominent role in so many of them, and why, in some of\nthese works, does Socrates play a smaller role, or none at all?\n\nOnce these questions are raised and their difficulty acknowledged, it\nis tempting, in reading Plato\u2019s works and reflecting upon them,\nto adopt a strategy of extreme caution. Rather than commit oneself to\nany hypothesis about what he is trying to communicate to his readers,\none might adopt a stance of neutrality about his intentions, and\nconfine oneself to talking only about what is said by his\ndramatis personae. One cannot be faulted, for\nexample, if one notes that, in Plato\u2019s Republic,\nSocrates argues that justice in the soul consists in each part of the\nsoul doing its own. It is equally correct to point out that other\nprincipal speakers in that work, Glaucon and Adeimantus, accept the\narguments that Socrates gives for that definition of justice. Perhaps\nthere is no need for us to say more\u2014to say, for example, that\nPlato himself agrees that this is how justice should be defined, or\nthat Plato himself accepts the arguments that Socrates gives in\nsupport of this definition. And we might adopt this same\n\u201cminimalist\u201d approach to all of Plato\u2019s\nworks. After all, is it of any importance to discover what went on\ninside his head as he wrote\u2014to find out whether he himself\nendorsed the ideas he put in the mouths of his characters, whether\nthey constitute \u201cthe philosophy of Plato\u201d? Should we not\nread his works for their intrinsic philosophical value, and not as\ntools to be used for entering into the mind of their author? We know\nwhat Plato\u2019s characters say\u2014and isn\u2019t that all that\nwe need, for the purpose of engaging with his works\nphilosophically?\n\nBut the fact that we know what Plato\u2019s characters say\ndoes not show that by refusing to entertain any hypotheses about what\nthe author of these works is trying to communicate to his readers we\ncan understand what those characters mean by what they say.\nWe should not lose sight of this obvious fact: it is Plato, not any of\nhis dramatis personae, who is reaching out to a readership\nand trying to influence their beliefs and actions by means of his\nliterary actions. When we ask whether an argument put forward by a\ncharacter in Plato\u2019s works should be read as an effort to\npersuade us of its conclusion, or is better read as a revelation of\nhow foolish that speaker is, we are asking about what Plato\nas author (not that character) is trying to lead us to believe,\nthrough the writing that he is presenting to our attention. We need to\ninterpret the work itself to find out what it, or Plato the author, is\nsaying. Similarly, when we ask how a word that has several different\nsenses is best understood, we are asking what Plato means to\ncommunicate to us through the speaker who uses that word. We should\nnot suppose that we can derive much philosophical value from\nPlato\u2019s writings if we refuse to entertain any thoughts about\nwhat use he intends us to make of the things his speakers say.\nPenetrating the mind of Plato and comprehending what his interlocutors\nmean by what they say are not two separate tasks but one, and if we do\nnot ask what his interlocutors mean by what they say, and what the\ndialogue itself indicates we should think about what they mean, we\nwill not profit from reading his dialogues.\n\nFurthermore, the dialogues have certain characteristics that are most\neasily explained by supposing that Plato is using them as vehicles for\ninducing his readers to become convinced (or more convinced than they\nalready are) of certain propositions\u2014for example, that there are\nforms, that the soul is not corporeal, that knowledge can be acquired\nonly by means of a study of the forms, and so on. Why, after all, did\nPlato write so many works (for example: Phaedo,\nSymposium, Republic, Phaedrus,\nTheaetetus, Sophist, Statesman,\nTimaeus, Philebus, Laws) in which one\ncharacter dominates the conversation (often, but not always, Socrates)\nand convinces the other speakers (at times, after encountering initial\nresistance) that they should accept or reject certain conclusions, on\nthe basis of the arguments presented? The only plausible way of\nanswering that question is to say that these dialogues were intended\nby Plato to be devices by which he might induce the audience for which\nthey are intended to reflect on and accept the arguments and\nconclusions offered by his principal interlocutor. (It is noteworthy\nthat in Laws, the principal speaker\u2014an unnamed visitor\nfrom Athens\u2014proposes that laws should be accompanied by\n\u201cpreludes\u201d in which their philosophical basis is given as\nfull an explanation as possible. The educative value of written texts\nis thus explicitly acknowledged by Plato\u2019s dominant speaker. If\npreludes can educate a whole citizenry that is prepared to learn from\nthem, then surely Plato thinks that other sorts of written\ntexts\u2014for example, his own dialogues\u2014can also serve an\neducative function.)\n\nThis does not mean that Plato thinks that his readers can become wise\nsimply by reading and studying his works. On the contrary, it is\nhighly likely that he wanted all of his writings to be supplementary\naids to philosophical conversation: in one of his works, he has\nSocrates warn his readers against relying solely on books, or taking\nthem to be authoritative. They are, Socrates says, best used as\ndevices that stimulate the readers\u2019 memory of discussions they\nhave had (Phaedrus 274e-276d). In those face-to-face\nconversations with a knowledgeable leader, positions are taken,\narguments are given, and conclusions are drawn. Plato\u2019s\nwritings, he implies in this passage from Phaedrus, will work\nbest when conversational seeds have already been sown for the\narguments they contain.\n",
