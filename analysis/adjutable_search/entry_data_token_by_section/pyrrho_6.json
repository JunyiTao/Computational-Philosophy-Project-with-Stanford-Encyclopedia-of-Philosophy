    "main_text": "Influences on Pyrrho\n7. Influences on Pyrrho\n\nMany different philosophical antecedents have been claimed for Pyrrho.\nSince we know very little about which philosophical currents Pyrrho\nmay have been acquainted with, such claims are bound to be in large\nmeasure speculative. There are, however, a couple of exceptions to\nthis; as noted at the outset, Pyrrho was associated with Anaxarchus\nand was reported to have encountered some unnamed Indian thinkers. The\nlittle that we know of Anaxarchus seems to suggest that his philosophy\nhad a good deal in common with Pyrrho\u2019s. Diogenes Laertius\n(9.60) ascribes to him an attitude of apatheia and\neukolia, \u2018freedom from emotion\u2019 and\n\u2018contentedness\u2019; as noted earlier, apatheia is\nused in some sources to describe Pyrrho\u2019s attitude as well, and\nthe combination of the two terms seems to describe something close to\nthe state cultivated by Pyrrho. We also hear from Sextus Empiricus\nthat Anaxarchus \u201clikened existing things to stage-painting and\ntook them to be similar to the things which strike us while asleep or\ninsane\u201d (M 7.88). This has often been taken as an early\nexpression of a form of epistemological scepticism. But it may also be\ntaken as an ontological comment on the insubstantiality of the world\naround us; it is things (as opposed to our impressions of\nthings) that are assimilated to stage-sets and the contents of dreams\nand fantasies. Either way, the remark looks like an anticipation of\nthe position expounded in the Aristocles passage; the first\nreading conforms to the epistemological interpretation of that\npassage, and the second to the metaphysical interpretation. It\nappears, then, that Pyrrho may have borrowed to a considerable extent\nfrom Anaxarchus, especially if the Aristocles passage as a whole\nrepresents Pyrrho\u2019s thought.\n\nWe do not know the identity of the \u201cnaked wise men\u201d whom\nPyrrho met in India, or what they thought. There are reports of other\nmeetings between Indian and Greek thinkers during Alexander\u2019s\nexpedition, and these tend to emphasize the Indians\u2019\nextraordinary impassivity and insensitivity to pain and hardship. It\nis not unlikely that Pyrrho, too, was impressed by traits of this\nkind. Though precedents for his ideal of ataraxia exist in\nearlier Greek philosophy as well, his reported ability to withstand\nsurgery without flinching is exceptional in the Greek context (and\nquite distinct from anything in later Pyrrhonism); if we believe this\nstory, it is tempting to explain it by way of some form of training\nfrom the Indians. Some scholars have sought to establish more detailed\nlinks between the thought of the Aristocles passage and various\ncurrents in ancient Indian philosophy; and Beckwith (2015) finds in\nPyrrho an authentic representative of early Buddhism. But there is at\nleast room for debate about how far these similarities really go. From\nan opposing perspective, some have suggested that the linguistic\nbarriers would have ruled out an interchange of any great\nphilosophical subtlety between the Indians and Pyrrho. But this may be\noverly pessimistic; the expedition lasted a number of years, and some\npeople manage to learn new languages remarkably quickly.\n\nBeyond these figures with attested connections to Pyrrho, it is\nplausible to suppose a certain influence on Pyrrho from Democritus.\nPyrrho is reported to have had a special admiration for Democritus\n(Diogenes Laertius 9.67, citing Pyrrho\u2019s associate Philo);\nDemocritus is one of the few philosophers besides Pyrrho himself who\nseems to escape serious criticism in Timon\u2019s Lampoons;\nand Anaxarchus belonged in the tradition of thinkers stemming from\nDemocritus. The influence may have been mainly in the ethical area;\nDemocritus, too, had an ethical ideal that is recognizably a\nforerunner to Pyrrho\u2019s ataraxia. If one adopts the\nepistemological interpretation of Pyrrho\u2019s philosophy, one may\nsee an additional area of influence in Democritus\u2019 sceptical\npronouncements about the prospects for knowledge of the world around\nus.\n\nAlternatively, if one interprets Pyrrho along metaphysical lines, one\nmay be inclined to look to Plato and the Eleatics as possible\ninfluences. Timon\u2019s verdicts on these figures in the\nLampoons are at least partially favorable; and, as was hinted\nat earlier on, the dim view of sensibles that is suggested by a number\nof Plato\u2019s dialogues\u2014but also anticipated by the\nEleatics\u2014seems to have something in common with Pyrrho\u2019s\nview of reality (on the metaphysical interpretation) as indeterminate.\nThe difference, of course, is that Pyrrho does not suggest any higher\nlevel of reality such as Plato\u2019s Forms or the Eleatic Being.\n",
