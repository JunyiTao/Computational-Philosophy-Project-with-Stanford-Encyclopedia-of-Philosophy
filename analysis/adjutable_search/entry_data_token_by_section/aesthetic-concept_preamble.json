    "main_text": "\n\nIntroduced into the philosophical lexicon during the Eighteenth\nCentury, the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 has come to designate, among\nother things, a kind of object, a kind of judgment, a kind of\nattitude, a kind of experience, and a kind of value. For the most\npart, aesthetic theories have divided over questions\nparticular to one or another of these designations: whether\nartworks are necessarily aesthetic objects; how to square the\nallegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact that\nwe give reasons in support of them; how best to capture the elusive\ncontrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one; whether to\ndefine aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological or\nrepresentational content; how best to understand the relation between\naesthetic value and aesthetic experience. But questions of more\ngeneral nature have lately arisen, and these have tended to\nhave a skeptical cast: whether any use of \u2018aesthetic\u2019 may\nbe explicated without appeal to some other; whether agreement\nrespecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoretical\nagreement or disagreement; whether the term ultimately answers to any\nlegitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in the\nlexicon. The skepticism expressed by such general questions did not\nbegin to take hold until the later part of the 20th century, and this\nfact prompts the question whether (a) the concept of the aesthetic is\ninherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed to\nsee that it is, or (b) the concept is fine and it is only recently\nthat we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise. Adjudicating\nbetween these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take in\nboth early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters.\n",
