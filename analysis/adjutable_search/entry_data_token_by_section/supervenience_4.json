    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || The Modal Force of the Supervenience Relation\n3.1 The Modal Force of the Supervenience Relation\n\nIn order to sort out how supervenience connects up to other\nrelations\u2014like entailment, reduction, grounding, ontological\ndependence, and explanation\u2014we need to discuss the fact that\nsupervenience can hold with varying degrees of modal force. That is,\nthe \u2018cannot\u2019 in \u201cthere cannot be an\nA-difference without a B-difference\u201d comes in\ndifferent strengths. For example, it can mean \u201ccannot as a\nmatter of logic,\u201d or it can mean \u201ccannot consistently with\nthe laws of nature\u201d.\n\nThis raises some controversial issues. For the purposes of this essay,\nwe make the following three assumptions. First, we assume that\nmetaphysical necessity is just as strong as logical necessity. There\nare, to be sure, metaphysically necessary truths that are not logical\ntruths, such as the truth that water = H20.\nBut metaphysical necessity is just as strong as logical necessity in\nthat the space of metaphysical possibility is exactly the same as the\nspace of logically possibility: the logically possible worlds = the\nmetaphysically possible worlds (see, e.g., McLaughlin 1995; Chalmers\n1996; and Jackson 1998). This is not entirely uncontroversial, but\nlittle we have to say turns on it. Second, and more importantly in\nwhat follows, we assume that at least certain properties that figure\nin laws of nature do not play their nomic roles essentially, so that\nit is logically or metaphysically possible for those properties not to\nfigure in the laws in question. This is also controversial, but we\nwill not defend it here. (See Shoemaker 1980, Swoyer 1982, and Ellis\n2001 for the opposing view.) Finally, we will assume that whatever is\nmetaphysically necessary is nomologically necessary, but not\nconversely. (One can hold that there are nomologically necessary\ntruths that are not metaphysically necessary, even if one holds that\nall nomic properties play their nomic roles essentially; see Fine\n2002.)\n\nSome supervenience relations are metaphysically (or logically)\nnecessary. The property being a haircut or a halibut\nsupervenes with metaphysical necessity on the two base properties\nbeing a haircut and being a halibut: two things\ncannot differ with respect to being a haircut or a halibut\nwithout differing either with respect to being a haircut or\nelse with respect to being a halibut. Also, the surface areas\nof perfect spheres supervene with metaphysical necessity on their\nvolumes (and vice versa) (Lombard 1986). Some supervenience\nrelations are metaphysically contingent. Consider the Wiedemann-Franz\nLaw, which entails that the electrical conductivity of a metal\nco-varies with its thermal conductivity. This law thus entails that\nelectrical conductivity and thermal conductivity mutually supervene on\neach other. But on the assumption that the law is metaphysically\ncontingent, the supervenience relation is too. It is only\nnomologically necessary that there cannot be a difference in one sort\nof conductivity without a difference in the other sort.\n\nSo, supervenience relations can hold with either metaphysical or\nnomological necessity, and perhaps even with some other kind of\nnecessity. The fact that supervenience comes in different modal\nstrengths is important. Sometimes there is widespread agreement that a\ncertain supervenience relation holds, but dispute over what its modal\nforce is. One important example is the supervenience of the mental on\nthe physical. Just about everyone, even a Cartesian dualist, believes\nsome version of this supervenience claim. But there is vigorous\ndisagreement about whether the supervenience relation holds with\nmetaphysical or merely nomological necessity. Ask yourself\u2014could\nthere be an individual that has no conscious experience at all,\ndespite being physically indiscernible from an individual that is\nconscious (Kirk 1994; Chalmers 1996)? That is, could there be what\nphilosophers call a \u2018zombie\u2019? Because it is widely agreed\nthat the mental nomologically supervenes on the physical, it is widely\nagreed that zombies are nomologically impossible\u2014that their\nexistence would violate psychophysical laws. But some philosophers\n(e.g., Chalmers 1996) think that zombies are metaphysically possible.\nThis remains a matter of lively dispute, and resolving it requires\naddressing some hard questions about the relationship between\nconceivability and metaphysical possibility. Suffice it to note that\nthe dispute is precisely over the modal force of the\n\u2018cannot\u2019 in \u201cthere cannot be a mental difference\nwithout a physical difference.\u201d (For discussions of the\nrelationship between conceivability and metaphysical possibility see,\ne.g., the essays in Gendler and Hawthorne 2002. For a discussion of\nphysicalism, see\n Section 5.4\n of this entry and the separate entry on\n physicalism.)\n",
