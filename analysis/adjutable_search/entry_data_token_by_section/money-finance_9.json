    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Financialization and Democracy\n5.1 Financialization and Democracy\n\nMany of the questions political philosophy raises about finance have\nto do with \u201cfinancialization\u201d. The phenomenon of\n\u201cfinancialization\u201d, whereby the economic system has become\ncharacterized by the increasing dominance of finance capital and by\nsystems of financial intermediation (Ert\u00fcrk et al. 2008; Davis\n2011; Engelen et al. 2011; Palley 2013), is of potentially substantial\nnormative significance in a number of regards. A related normative\nconcern is the potential growth in political power of the financial\nsector, which may be seen as a threat to democratic politics.\n\nThese worries are, in effect, an amplification of familiar concerns\nabout the \u201cstructural power\u201d or \u201cstructural\nconstraints\u201d of capital, whereby capitalist investors are able\nto reduce the freedom of action of democratic governments by\nthreatening \u201cinvestment strikes\u201d when their preferred\npolitical options are not pursued (see Lindblom 1977, 1982; Przeworski\n& Wallerstein 1988; Cohen 1989; B. Barry 2002; Christiano 2010,\n2012; Furendal & O\u2019Neill 2022). To take one recent version\nof these worries, Stuart White argues that a republican commitment to\npopular sovereignty is in significant tension with the acceptance of\nan economic system where important choices about investment, and hence\nthe direction of development of the economy, are under the control of\nfinancial interests (White 2011).\n\nIn many such debates, the fault-line seems to be the traditional one\nbetween those who favor social coordination by free markets, and hence\nstrict limitations on state activities, and those who favor democratic\npolitics, and hence strict limitations on markets (without denying\nthat there can be intermediate positions). But the current financial\nsystem is not a pure creature of the free market. In the\nfinancial system that we currently see, the principle that individuals\nare to be held financially accountable for their actions, and that\nthey will therefore be \u201cdisciplined\u201d by markets, is patchy\nat best. One major issue, discussed above, is the problem of banks\nthat are so large and interconnected that their failure would risk\ntaking down the whole financial system\u2014hence, they can\nanticipate that they will be bailed out by tax-payers\u2019 money,\nwhich creates a huge \u201cmoral hazard\u201d problem (e.g., Pistor\n2013, 2017). In addition, current legal systems find it difficult to\nimpose accountability for complex processes of divided labor, which is\nwhy there were very few legal remedies after the financial crisis of\n2008 (e.g., Reiff 2017).\n\nThe lack of accountability intensifies worries about the power\nrelations between democratic politicians and individuals or\ncorporations in the financial realm. One question is whether we can\neven apply our standard concept of democracy to societies that have\nthe kinds of financial systems we see today. We may ask whether\nsocieties that are highly financialized can ever be true democracies,\nor whether they are more likely to be \u201cpost-democracies\u201d\n(Crouch 2004). For example, states with high levels of sovereign debt\nwill need to consider the reaction of financial markets in every\nsignificant policy decision (see, e.g., Streeck 2013 [2014], see also\nKlein 2020) Moreover \u201crevolving doors\u201d between private\nfinancial institutions and supervising authorities impact on the\nability of public officials to hold financial agents accountable. This\nis similar to the problems of conflicts of interest raised above (see\nsections\n 2\n and\n 4.2.2).\n If financial contracts become a central, or maybe even the\nmost central, form of social relations (Lazzarato 2012), this may\ncreate an incompatibility with the equal standing of citizens,\nirrespective of financial position, that should be the basis of a\ndemocratic society and its public sphere of deliberation (see also\nBennett 2020 from an epistemic perspective).\n\nWhile finance has, over long stretches of history, been rather\nstrictly regulated, there has been a reversed trend towards\nderegulation since roughly the 1970s. After the financial crisis of\n2008, there have been many calls for reregulation. Proposals include\nhigher capital ratios in banks (Admati & Hellwig 2013), a return\nto the separation of commercial banking from speculative finance, as\nhad been the case, in the US, during the period when the\nGlass-Steagall Act was in place (Kay 2015), or a financial transaction\ntax (Wollner 2014). However, given that the financial system is a\nglobal system, one controversial question is whether regulatory steps\nby single countries would have any effect other than capital\nflight.\n",
