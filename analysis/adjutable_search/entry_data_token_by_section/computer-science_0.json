    "main_text": "Computational Systems\n1. Computational Systems\n\nComputational systems are widespread in everyday life. Their design,\ndevelopment and analysis are the proper object of study of the\ndiscipline of computer science. The philosophy of computer science\ntreats them instead as objects of theoretical analysis. Its first aim\nis to define such systems, i.e., to develop an ontology of\ncomputational systems. The literature offers two main approaches on\nthe topic. A first one understands computational systems as defined by\ndistinct ontologies for software and hardware, usually taken to be\ntheir elementary components. A different approach sees computational\nsystems as comprising several other elements around the\nsoftware-hardware dichotomy: under this second view, computational\nsystems are defined on the basis of a hierarchy of levels of\nabstraction, arranging hardware levels at the bottom of such a\nhierarchy and extending upwards to elements of the design and\ndownwards to include the user. In the following we present these two\napproaches.\n",
