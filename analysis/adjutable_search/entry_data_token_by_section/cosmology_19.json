    "main_text": "Anthropic Reasoning and Multiverse || Fine-Tuning\n4.2 Fine-Tuning\n\nFine-tuning arguments start from a conflict between two different\nperspectives on certain features of cosmology (or other physical\ntheories). On the first perspective, the existence of creatures like\nus seems to be sensitive to a wide variety of aspects of cosmology and\nphysics. To be more specific, the prospects for life depend\nsensitively on the values of the various fundamental constants that\nappear in these theories. The SM includes about 10 constants, and the\nparticle physics standard model includes about 20\n more.[48]\n Tweaking the SM, or the standard model of particle physics, by\nchanging the values of these constants seems to lead to a barren\n cosmos.[49]\n Focusing on the existence of \u201clife\u201d runs the risk of\nbeing too provincial; we don\u2019t have a good general account of\nwhat physical systems can support intelligent life. Yet it does seem\nplausible that intelligence requires an organism with complex\nstructural features, living in a sufficiently stable environment.\n\nAt a bare minimum, the existence of life seems to require the\nexistence of complex structures at a variety of scales, ranging from\ngalaxies to planetary systems to macro-molecules. Such complexity is\nextremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants of\nnature. From this perspective, the existence of life in the universe\nis fragile in the sense that it depends sensitively on these aspects\nof the underlying theory.\n\nThis view contrasts sharply with the status of the constants from the\nperspective of fundamental physics. Particle physicists typically\nregard their theories as effective field theories, which suffice for\ndescribing interactions at some specified energy scale. These theories\ninclude various constants, characterizing the relative strength of the\ninteractions they describe, that cannot be further explained by the\neffective field theory. The constants can be fixed by experimental\nresults, but are not derivable from fundamental physical principles.\n(If the effective field theory can be derived from a more fundamental\ntheory, the value of the constants can in principle be determined by\nintegrating out higher-energy degrees of freedom. But this merely\npushes the question back one step: the constants appearing in the more\nfundamental theory are determined experimentally.) Similarly, the\nconstants appearing in the SM are treated as contingent features of\nthe universe. There is no underlying physical principle that sets, for\nexample, the cosmological densities of different kinds of matter, or\nthe value of the Hubble constant.\n\nSo features of our theories that appear entirely contingent, from the\npoint of view of physics, are necessary to account for the complexity\nof the observed universe and the very possibility of life. The\nfine-tuning argument starts from a sense of unease about this\nsituation: shouldn\u2019t something as fundamental as the complexity\nof the universe be explained by the laws or basic\nprinciples of the theory, and not left to brute facts regarding\nthe values of various constants? The unease develops into serious\ndiscomfort if the specific values of the constants are taken to be\nextremely unlikely: how could the values of all these constants be\njust right, by sheer coincidence?\n\nIn many familiar cases, our past experience is a good guide to when an\napparent coincidence calls for further explanation. As Hume\nemphasized, however, intuitive assessments from everyday life of\nwhether a given event is likely, or requires a further explanation, do\nnot extend to cosmology. Recent formulations of fine-tuning arguments\noften introduce probabilistic considerations. The constants are\n\u201cfine-tuned\u201d, meaning that the observed values are\n\u201cimprobable\u201d in some sense. Introducing a well-defined\nprobability over the constants would provide a response to Hume:\nrather than extrapolating our intuitions, we would be drawing on the\nformal machinery of our physical theories to identify fine-tuning.\nPromising though this line of argument may be, there is not an obvious\nway to define physical probabilities over the values of different\nconstants, or over other features of the laws. There is nothing like\nthe structure used to justify physical probabilities in other\ncontexts, such as equilibrium statistical\n mechanics.[50]\n\n\nThere are four main responses to fine-tuning:\n\nEmpiricist Denial: This response follows Hume in denying\nthat a clear problem has even been identified. One form of this\nresponse challenges appeals to probability, undermining the claim that\nthere are unexplained coincidences. Alternatively, fine-tuning is\ntaken to reveal that the laws alone are not sufficient to account for\nsome features of nature; these features are properly explained by the\nlaws in conjunction with various contingent facts.\nDesigner: Newton famously argued, for example, that the\nstability of the solar system provides evidence of providential\ndesign. For the hypothesized Designer to be supported by fine-tuning\nevidence, we require some way of specifying what kind of universe the\nDesigner is likely to create; only such a specific Design hypothesis,\nbased in some theory of the nature of the Designer, can offer an\nexplanation of fine-tuning.\nNew Physics: The fine-tuning can be eliminated by\nmodifying physical theory in a variety of ways: altering the dynamical\nlaws, introducing new constraints on the space of physical\npossibilities (or possible values of the constants of nature),\netc.\nMultiverse: Fine-tuning is explained as a result of\nselection, from among a large space of possible universes (or\nmultiverse).\n\n\nIn the next section we discuss the last response in more detail; see\n \u00a73\n for further discussion of the third response.\n",
