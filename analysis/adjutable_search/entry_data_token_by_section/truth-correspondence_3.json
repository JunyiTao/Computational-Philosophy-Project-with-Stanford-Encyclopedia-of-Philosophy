    "main_text": "Truthbearers, Truthmakers, Truth || Truthbearers\n2.1 Truthbearers\n\n\nCorrespondence theories of truth have been given for beliefs,\nthoughts, ideas, judgments, statements, assertions, utterances,\nsentences, and propositions. It has become customary to talk\nof truthbearers whenever one wants to stay neutral between\nthese choices. Five points should be kept in mind:\n\nThe term \u201ctruthbearer\u201d is somewhat misleading. It is\nintended to refer to bearers of truth or falsehood\n(truth-value-bearers), or alternatively, to things of which it makes\nsense to ask whether they are true or false, thus allowing for the\npossibility that some of them might be neither.\nOne distinguishes between\nsecondary and primary truthbearers. Secondary\ntruthbearers are those whose truth-values (truth or\nfalsehood) are derived from the truth-values of primary truthbearers,\nwhose truth-values are not derived from any other\ntruthbearers. Consequently, the term \u201ctrue\u201d is usually\nregarded as ambiguous, taking its primary meaning when applied to\nprimary truthbearers and various secondary meanings when applied to\nother truthbearers. This is, however, not a brute ambiguity, since the\nsecondary meanings are supposed to be derived, i.e. definable from,\nthe primary meaning together with additional relations. For example,\none might hold that propositions are true or false in the primary\nsense, whereas sentences are true or false in a secondary sense,\ninsofar as they express propositions that are true or false\n(in the primary sense). The meanings of \u201ctrue\u201d, when\napplied to truthbearers of different kinds, are thus connected in a\nmanner familiar from what Aristotelians called\n\u201canalogical\u201d uses of a term\u2014nowadays one would call\nthis \u201cfocal meaning\u201d; e.g., \u201chealthy\u201d in\n\u201chealthy organism\u201d and \u201chealthy food\u201d, the\nlatter being defined as healthy in the secondary sense of contributing\nto the healthiness (primary sense) of an organism.\nIt is often unproblematic to advocate one theory of truth for\nbearers of one kind and another theory for bearers of a different kind\n(e.g., a deflationary theory of truth, or an identity theory, applied\nto propositions, could be a component of some form of correspondence\ntheory of truth for sentences). Different theories of truth applied to\nbearers of different kinds do not automatically compete. The standard\nsegregation of truth theories into competing camps (found in\ntextbooks, handbooks, and dictionaries) proceeds under the\nassumption\u2014really a pretense\u2014that they are intended for\nprimary truthbearers of the same kind.\nConfusingly, there is little agreement as to which entities are\nproperly taken to be primary truthbearers. Nowadays, the main\ncontenders are public language sentences, sentences of the language of\nthought (sentential mental representations), and propositions. Popular\nearlier contenders\u2014beliefs, judgments, statements, and\nassertions\u2014have fallen out of favor, mainly for two reasons:\n  \n  \nThe problem of logically complex truthbearers. A\nsubject, S, may hold a disjunctive belief (the baby will be a boy or\nthe baby will be a girl), while believing only one, or neither, of the\ndisjuncts. Also, S may hold a conditional belief (if whales are fish,\nthen some fish are mammals) without believing the antecedent or the\nconsequent. Also, S will usually hold a negative belief (not everyone\nis lucky) without believing what is negated. In such cases, the\ntruth-values of S\u2019s complex beliefs depend on the truth-values\nof their constituents, although the constituents may not be believed\nby S or by anyone. This means that a view according to which beliefs\nare primary truthbearers seems unable to account for how the\ntruth-values of complex beliefs are connected to the truth-values of\ntheir simpler constituents\u2014to do this one needs to be able to\napply truth and falsehood to belief-constituents even when they\nare not believed. This point, which is equally fundamental for a\nproper understanding of logic, was made by all early advocates of\npropositions (cf. Bolzano 1837, I.\u00a7\u00a722, 34; Frege 1879, \u00a7\u00a72-5; Husserl\n1900, I.\u00a711; Meinong 1902, \u00a76). The problem arises in much the same\nform for views that would take judgments, statements, or assertions as\nprimary truthbearers. The problem is not easily evaded. Talk of\nunbelieved beliefs (unjudged judgments, unstated statements,\nunasserted assertions) is either absurd or simply amounts to talk of\nunbelieved (unjudged, unstated, unasserted) propositions or\nsentences. It is noteworthy, incidentally, that quite a few\nphilosophical proposals (concerning truth as well as other matters)\nrun afoul of the simple observation that there are unasserted and\nunbelieved truthbearers (cf. Geach 1960 & 1965).\nThe duality of  state/content\na.k.a. act/object. The noun \u201cbelief\u201d can refer\nto the state of believing or to its content, i.e.,\nto what is believed. If the former, the state of believing,\ncan be said to be true or false at all, which is highly questionable,\nthen only insofar as the latter, what is believed, is true or\nfalse. Similarly for nouns referring to mental acts or their objects\n(contents), such as \u201cjudgment\u201d, \u201cstatement\u201d,\nand \u201cassertion\u201d.\n\nMental sentences were the preferred primary truthbearers\nthroughout the medieval period. They were neglected in the first half\nof the 20th century, but made a comeback in the second half through\nthe revival of the representational theory of the mind (especially in\nthe form of the language-of-thought hypothesis, cf. Fodor\n1975). Somewhat confusingly (to us now), for many centuries the term\n\u201cproposition\u201d (propositio) was reserved\nexclusively for sentences, written, spoken or mental. This use was\nmade official by Boethius in the 6th century, and is still found in\nLocke\u2019s Essay in 1705 and in\nMill\u2019s Logic in 1843. Some time after that, e.g., in\nMoore\u2019s 1901-01, \u201cproposition\u201d switched sides, the\nterm now being used for what is said by uttering a sentence,\nfor what is believed, judged, stated, assumed (etc.)\u2014with\noccasional reversions to medieval usage, e.g. in Russell (1918,\n1919).\n\n",
