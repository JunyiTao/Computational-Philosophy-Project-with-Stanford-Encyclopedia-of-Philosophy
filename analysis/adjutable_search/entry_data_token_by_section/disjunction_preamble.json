    "main_text": "\n\nIn logic, disjunction is a binary connective (\\(\\vee\\)) classically\ninterpreted as a truth function the output of which is true if at\nleast one of the input sentences (disjuncts) is true, and false\notherwise. Its supposed connection with disjunctive words of natural\nlanguage like or has long intrigued philosophers, logicians\nand linguists. In this entry we give an overview of logical and\nlinguistic analyses of disjunction with focus on developments at the\ninterface between logic and language. Sections 1 and 2 present\ndisjunction as a binary connective in classical logic and in a number\nof non-classical interpretations. Section 3 discusses some basic facts\nconcerning disjunctive words in natural language, and introduces a\ngeneralized, cross-categorial notion of disjunction as the\njoin operator in a (Boolean) algebra. Section 4 and 5 present\nGrice\u2019s account of the use of or in conversation and\nrecent developments in the discussion on inclusive and exclusive uses\nof linguistic disjunctive words. Finally, sections 6 and 7 introduce\ntwo recent non-classical accounts of linguistic disjunction and\ndiscuss applications to phenomena of free choice, disjunctive\nquestions and counterfactuals with disjunctive antecedents.\n",
