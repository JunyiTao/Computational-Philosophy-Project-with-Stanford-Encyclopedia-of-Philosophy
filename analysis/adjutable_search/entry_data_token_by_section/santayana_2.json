Development of Santayana\u2019s Philosophy\n\n\nIn his autobiography, Persons and Places, Santayana describes\nthe development of his thought as a movement from the idealisms of\nboyhood to the intellectual materialism of a traveling student, and\nfinally to the complete, naturalistic outlook of the adult\nSantayana. He emphasizes the continuity of his life and beliefs,\ncontrasting what may appear to be disparate views with the overall\nunity of his thought: \u201cThe more I change the more I am the same\nperson\u201d (Persons and Places, 159).\n\n\nAs a young man of the nineteenth century, he was influenced by the\nidealism of the age and of his age, but he claims to have always been a\nrealist or naturalist at heart.\n\n\nBut those ideal universes in my head did not produce any firm\nconvictions or actual duties. They had nothing to do with the wretched\npoverty-stricken real world in which I was condemned to live. That the\nreal was rotten and only the imaginary at all interesting seemed to me\naxiomatic. That was too sweeping; yet allowing for the rash\ngeneralisations of youth, it is still what I think. My philosophy has\nnever changed. (Persons and Places, 167)\n\n\nHence he notes, that in spite \u201cof my religious and other\nday-dreams, I was at bottom a young realist; I knew I was dreaming,\nand so was awake. A sure proof of this was that I was never anxious\nabout what those dreams would have involved if they had been true. I\nnever had the least touch of superstition\u201d (Persons and\nPlaces, 167).  Santayana cites poems, \u201cTo the Moon\u201d\nand \u201cTo the Host,\u201d written when he was fifteen or sixteen,\nas revealing this early realism, and he quotes from memory one stanza\nof \u201cAt the Church Door\u201d where the realistic sentiment is\nthe same (Persons and Places, 169).\n\n\nBy the time he was a traveling student seeing the world in Germany,\nEngland, and Spain his \u201cintellectual materialism\u201d was firmly\nestablished with little change in his religious affections.\n\n\nFrom the boy dreaming awake in the church of the Immaculate\nConception, to the travelling student seeing the world in Germany,\nEngland, and Spain there had been no great change in sentiment.\nI was\nstill \u201cat the church door\u201d. Yet in belief, in the\nclarification of my philosophy, I had taken an important step. I no\nlonger wavered between alternative views of the world, to be put on or\ntaken off like alternative plays at the theatre. I now saw that there\nwas only one possible play, the actual history of nature and of\nmankind, although there might well be ghosts among the characters and\nsoliloquies among the speeches. Religions, all religions, and\nidealistic philosophies, all idealistic philosophies, were the\nsoliloquies and the ghosts. They might be eloquent and profound. Like\nHamlet\u2019s soliloquy they might be excellent reflective criticisms of\nthe play as a whole. Nevertheless they were only parts of it, and\ntheir value as criticisms lay entirely in their fidelity to the facts,\nand to the sentiments which those facts aroused in the\ncritic. (Persons and Places, 169)\n\n\nThe full statement and development of his materialism did not occur\nuntil later in his life. It was certainly in place by the time of\nScepticism and Animal Faith (1923) but not fully so at the\ntime of The Life of Reason (1905). The influence of the\nHarvard philosophers, particularly James and Royce is evident in\nSantayana\u2019s thought, but he was hardly a mere follower and often\nadvanced his philosophy more along European and Greek lines rather than\nthe American tradition, which he thought was both too derivative and\ntoo tied to the advancement of business and capitalism.\n\n\nThe move from Harvard marked not only a geographical shift but a\nphilosophical one as well. Henry Levinson in Santayana,\nPragmatism, and the Spiritual Life provides a well-balanced\naccount of this gradual but distinctive move from the Harvard\nphilosophical mentality.  Leaving Harvard also meant that Santayana\nabandoned the view of a philosopher as a public, philosophical\nstatesman and of language as being representative. This philosophical\nturn placed makes him a forerunner of many issues in the next two\ncenturies. Removing himself, literally and philosophically, from the\nAmerican scene, Santayana increasingly came to believe that the\n\u201cbrimstone\u201d sensibility of pragmatism was wrong-headed\n(Character and Opinion in the United States, 53). A major\naspect of this sensibility was the view that philosophers must be\nengaged fundamentally in social and cultural policy formulation, and\nif they are not, they are not pulling their civic weight. In this\nfashion, Santayana believes the pragmatists came to belie \u201cthe\ngenuinely expressive, poetic, meditative, and festive character of\ntheir vocation\u201d (Levinson,165). A condition that James took\nseriously in his \u201cOn a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,\u201d\nsuggesting that the world of practical responsibility fosters a\nblindness to multiplural ways of living that can only be escaped by\ncatching sight of \u201cthe world of impersonal worths as such\u201d\n\u2014 \u201conly your mystic, your dreamer, or your insolent loafer\nor tramp can afford so sympathetic an occupation\u201d (James,\nTalks to Teachers on Psychology and to Students on Some of\nLife\u2019s Ideals, 141).  Interestingly, America\u2019s\nimperialistic actions toward the Philippines during the\nSpanish-American War sparked James\u2019 remarks; this was a war that\nhad a much deeper ancestral and historical aspect for Santayana and\nled to his poem, \u201cYoung Sammy\u2019s First Wild Oats.\u201d\nWhether connected or not, Santayana later came to identify himself as\nan intellectual vagabond or tramp, not isolated in the specific\nperspectives of an ideology, hosted by the world, and devoted to\nspiritual disciplines that \u201cappear irresponsible to philosophers\nhoping to command representative or some otherwise privileged\nauthority at the center of society\u201d (Levinson, 167).\n\n\nBuilding on his naturalism, institutional pragmatism, social\nrealism, and poetic religion, Santayana on leaving Harvard moves even\nfarther from the role of philosophical statesman by removing the\nrepresentative authority of language from the quest for a comprehensive\nsynthesis, by narrowing the line between literature and philosophy (as\nhe had earlier done between religion and poetry), and by wrestling more\nwith the influence of James than of Emerson. Santayana\u2019s stay in Oxford\nduring the Great War led to his famous counter to Wilson\u2019s war to end\nall wars: \u201cOnly the dead have seen the end of war.\u201d (Soliloquies in\nEngland and Later Soliloquies, 102)\n\n\nSantayana\u2019s message is clear: The epistemological project that\nRussell\u2019s Problems epitomizes is diseased. The renewed quest\nto establish unmediated Knowledge of Reality simply leads to\n\u201cintellectual cramp\u201d (Soliloquies, 216). Philosophy has itself\nbecome spiritually disordered by blinding its practitioners\nfrom their traditional and proper task, which is to celebrate the good\nlife. If the spiritual disciplines of philosophy are to thrive,\nphilosophers have to take off the bandages of epistemology and\nmetaphysics altogether, accept the finite and fallible status of their\nknowledge claims, and get on with confessing their belief in the things\nthat make life worth living (Levinson, 204).\n\n\nLeaving Harvard and America enabled Santayana to develop his\nnaturalism.\n",
