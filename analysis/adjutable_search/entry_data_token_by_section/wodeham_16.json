Among other\nthings, Chatton is concerned about the implications of Wodeham\u2019s\nposition for the necessity of faith. Wodeham\u2019s reply not only\ngives us a nice illustration of how his moral theory plays out in\nconcrete instances, but also provides us with a helpful introduction\nto his position on the nature of belief and its connection to the\nwill.\n\nChatton is concerned that if one holds a position similar to the one\nof Wodeham there will no longer be any need for faith or belief, but\nonly the desire to believe. Chatton has this concern because, for him,\nthe act of belief is not directly under the control of the will (cf;\nOO IV 36, ll. 20\u201323). Wodeham responds by starkly distinguishing\nbetween two kinds of faith. Infused faith, which appears to be a pure\nact of the will and acquired faith which is not a direct act of the\nwill and is not required for salvation (OO IV 58, ll.13\u201314).\nPresumably, this act of acquired belief is an act of the intellect and\na response to the relative evidence of a given proposition or an\nentire syllogism taken together (see above An Evident\nJudgment).\n\nWith this distinction in place, Wodeham uses his moral theory to show\nthat the act of acquired belief, described as the act of believing\ncalmly (quiete) and presumably without intellectual\nhesitation or doubt, does not add any moral worth. This is the case\nsince, as we have already seen, if one wishes to believe, but is\nprevented from doing so by a lack of power, the agent should\nnot be held responsible for this lack of power. Reasons for such a\nlack of power include a melancholic disturbance, a passion, or sophism\n(OO IV 58, ll. 15\u201318). He further concludes, it is quite\npossible that the person who wishes to believe, but is not able to do\nso calmly (quiete), may be more morally praiseworthy than the\nperson who intellectually believes \u201cquietly\u201d and is not\nbeset by doubt. Intriguingly, he critiques Lombard at this point,\nsaying: \n\n\nIf the Master means to say that in order to achieve salvation one must\nbelieve with something more than a perfect will, but must also have\nbelief calmly (quiete), then he does think\ncorrectly\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. (OO IV 58, ll. 26\u201329)\n\n",
