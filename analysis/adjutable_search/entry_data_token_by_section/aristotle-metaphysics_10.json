    "main_text": "Substance as Cause of Being\n11. Substance as Cause of Being\n\nIn \u0396.17 Aristotle proposes a new point of departure in his effort\nto say what sort of a thing substance is. The new idea is that a\nsubstance is a \u201cstarting-point and cause\u201d (arch\u00ea\nkai aitia, 1041a9) of being. Before looking at the\ndetails of his account, we will need to make a brief detour into\nAristotle\u2019s theory of causes. The relevant texts are\nPhysics II.3, Posterior Analytics II.11,\nand Metaphysics \u0391.3 and \u0394.2. See also the entry\non\n Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy\n and Section 2 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology.\n\nThe word aitia (\u201ccause\u201d or, perhaps better,\n\u201cexplanation\u201d), Aristotle tells us, is \u201csaid in many\nways.\u201d In one sense, a cause is \u201cthat out of which a thing\ncomes to be, and which persists; e.g., bronze, silver, and the genus\nof these are causes of a statue or a bowl\u201d (Physics\n194b24). A cause in this sense has been traditionally\ncalled a material cause, although Aristotle himself did not\nuse this label. In a second sense, a cause is \u201cthe form \u2026\nthe account of the essence\u201d (194b27), traditionally\ncalled the formal cause. A third sense, traditionally called\nthe efficient cause, is \u201cthe primary source of change\nor rest\u201d (194b30). In this sense, Aristotle says, an\nadviser is the cause of an action, a father is the cause of his child,\nand in general the producer is the cause of the product. Fourth is\nwhat is traditionally called the final cause, which Aristotle\ncharacterizes as \u201cthe end (telos), that for which a\nthing is done\u201d (194b33). In this sense, he says,\nhealth is the cause of walking, since we might explain a\nperson\u2019s walking by saying that he walks in order to be\nhealthy\u2014health is what the walking is for. Note that,\nas in this case, \u201cthings may be causes of one another\u2014hard\nwork of fitness, and fitness of hard work\u2014although not in the\nsame sense: fitness is what hard work is for, whereas hard work is\nprinciple of motion\u201d (195a10). So hard work is the\nefficient cause of fitness, since one becomes fit by means of hard\nwork, while fitness is the final cause of hard work, since one works\nhard in order to become fit.\n\nAlthough Aristotle is careful to distinguish four different kinds of\ncause (or four different senses of \u2018cause\u2019), it is\nimportant to note that he claims that one and the same thing can be a\ncause in more than one sense. As he puts it, \u201cform, mover, and\ntelos often coincide\u201d (198a25). And in\nDe Anima he is perfectly explicit that the soul, which is the\nform or essence of a living thing, \u201cis a cause in three of the\nways we have distinguished\u201d (415b10)\u2014efficient,\nformal, and final.\n\nLet us return to Aristotle\u2019s discussion in \u0396.17. The job of\na cause or principle of being, he notes, is to explain why one thing\nbelongs to another (1041a11); that is, it is to explain\nsome predicational fact. What needs to be explained, for example, is\nwhy this is a man, or that is a house. But what kind\nof a question is this? The only thing that can be a man is a man; the\nonly thing that can be a house is a house. So we would appear to be\nasking why a man is a man, or why a house is a house, and these seem\nto be foolish questions that all have the same answer: because each\nthing is itself (1041a17\u201320). The questions must\ntherefore be rephrased by taking advantage of the possibility of a\nhylomorphic analysis. We must ask, e.g., \u201cwhy are\nthese\u2014for example, brick and stones\u2014a house?\u201d\n(1041a26). The answer Aristotle proposes is that the cause\nof being of a substance (e.g., of a house) is the form or essence that\nis predicated of the matter (e.g., of the bricks and stones) that\nconstitute that substance. The essence is not always just a formal\ncause; in some cases, Aristotle says, it is also a final cause (he\ngives the examples of a house and a bed), and in some cases an\nefficient cause (1041a29\u201330). But in any case\n\u201cwhat is being looked for is the cause in virtue of which the\nmatter is something\u2014and this is the substance\u201d\n(1041b6\u20139) and \u201cthe primary cause of its\nbeing\u201d (1041b27).\n\nNotice that the explanandum in these cases (\u201cwhy is this a\nman?\u201d or \u201cwhy is that a house?\u201d) involves a species\npredication (\u201cCallias is a man,\u201d \u201cFallingwater is a\nhouse\u201d). But the answer Aristotle proposes invokes a hylomorphic\nanalysis of these questions, in which form is predicated of matter. So\nCallias is a man because the form or essence of man is present in the\nflesh and bones that constitute the body of Callias; Fallingwater is a\nhouse because the form of house is present in the materials of which\nFallingwater is made. In general, a species predication is explained\nin terms of an underlying form predication, whose subject is not the\nparticular compound but its matter. Form predications are thus more\nbasic than their corresponding species predications. A substantial\nform, as a primary definable, is its own substance, for it is\nessentially predicated of itself alone. But the substantial form of a\nmaterial compound, because it is predicated (accidentally) of the\nmatter of the compound, is the cause of the compound\u2019s being the\nkind of thing that it is. The form is therefore, in a derivative way,\nthe substance of the compound, as well.\n",
