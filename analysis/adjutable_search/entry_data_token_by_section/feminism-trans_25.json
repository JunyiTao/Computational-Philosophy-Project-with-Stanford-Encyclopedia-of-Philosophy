    "main_text": "Toward a Trans/Feminism || Trans Woman Manifesto\n10.2 Trans Woman Manifesto\n\n\nAnother version of trans feminist politics has been elaborated by\nJulia Serano who distinguishes between traditional sexism (which she\nsees as the belief that males and masculinity are superior to females\nand femininity) and oppositional sexism (which she sees as the belief\nthat male and female, along with masculinity and femininity,\nconstitute exclusive categories) (2007, 12\u20133). Serano coins the\nexpression trans-misogyny to capture forms of discrimination\nwhich pertain specifically to trans women which principally target\ntheir perceived femininity (13). For example, Serano points to ways in\nwhich some trans women are represented in the media as either sexually\npredatory deceivers or pathetic, laughable, fakes (36). In Serano's\nview, such representations derive largely from a sexist focus on the\nfeminine presentation of trans women and the tendency to view\nfemininity as artificial (43\u201344). Serano also provocatively\nargues that the devaluation of feminine males is a distinctive form of\ntraditional sexism which she calls \u201ceffemimania\u201d (129,\n287).\n\n\nSerano posits the existence of a \u201csubconscious sex\u201d to\ncapture the traditional notion of gender identity without requiring an\ninitial conscious awareness of \u201cwrong body\u201d which she\nsuggests is biologically grounded and largely limited to body rather\nthan social role (78\u201382). (In this way, her notion echoes\nProsser's appeal to \u201cbody ego.\u201d) Serano deploys the\nterm cissexualism to indicate the advantaging of those for\nwhom biological sex and subconscious sex are in alignment. The term\ncisgenderism, by contrast, indicates the assumption that males\nought to be masculine and females ought to be feminine (where\nmasculinity and femininity are constituted by the set of attributes\ntypically associated with males and females respectively) (90). Serano\ntakes the position that while some forms of femininity may be socially\ninstituted, many feminine attributes may also be biologically grounded.\nShe writes:\n\n\nOne would have to have a rather grim view of the female population\nto believe that a majority could so easily be \u201cbrainwashed\u201d\nor \u201ccoerced\u201d into enthusiastically adopting an entirely\ncontrived of wholly artificial set of gender expressions. In fact, it\nseems incomprehensible that so many women could so actively gravitate\ntoward femininity unless there was something about it that resonated\nwith them on a profound level. (2007, 339)\n\n\nThere is a worry, however, about Serano's under-estimation of the\ndegree and depth of female subordination as well as her theoretical\nfailure to distinguish between \u201cpersonal resonance\u201d and\nenforced social acquiescence. In Serano's view, many (non-trans)\nfeminists have engaged in negative assessments of femininity (viewing\nit as strictly an imposed artifice) and thereby implicated themselves\nin a form of sexism. Indeed, Serano claims that any feminist critique\nof trans femininity is inherently anti-feminist:\n\n\nIn other words, when we critique any gender as being\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad,\u2019 we are by definition, being\nsexist. After all, isn't what drives many of us into feminism and\nqueer activism in the first place our frustration that other people\noften place rather arbitrary meanings and values onto our sexed bodies,\ngender expression, and sexualities? (2007, 360)\n\n\nWhile Serano may be right to raise worries about the ways in which the\nbehavior of trans women has been unfairly judged, a position which\nallows for no analysis of politically problematic gender behavior at\nall seems to seriously impair feminism's critical force. The core\nissue is that Serano does not see gender as fundamentally relational.\nThis allows her to view gender as something that everybody ought to be\nfree to express in any way they want to (free of judgment as\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019). However, once gender is\nviewed as relational, it seems entirely appropriate to raise feminist\nworries about certain forms of masculinity that involve treating women\nbadly and certain forms of femininity that involve accepting poor\ntreatment. Once gender is recognized as relational (i.e., as involving\nthe treatment of other gendered people in particular ways), it can be\nsubject to ethical evaluation (e.g.,\u201cthat gendered behavior\ninvolves hurting people\u201d). For the very sake of trans women and\ntheir safety, such a trans feminist intervention is surely\nappropriate.\n\n\nIn fairness to Serano, she does not fail to note sexist relations\nbetween men and women. Indeed, she offers a rich account of the\nsexualization of trans women (2007, 253\u2013262). In her view,\nhowever, such negative relational features which accrue to femininity\nflow from the inappropriate interpretation and evaluation of\nfemininity, rather than femininity itself. That said, the difficulty\nis how one is to distinguish femininity as abstracted from such\nrelational social meanings. Even if such a project were possible, it\nseems clear enough that feminists are concerned precisely by the\nharmful forms of masculinity and femininity that are deeply implicated\nin systems of social meaning. And it seems unfair to accuse feminists\nwho raise worries about such forms of sexism as themselves sexist, by\nconstruing them as negatively assessing some culturally abstracted\nform of femininity.\n",
