    "main_text": "The Basics: People, Activities and Overview of Doctrines || People\n2.1 People\n\nThe Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers\nand philosophically interested scientists who met under the (nominal)\nleadership of Moritz Schlick for often weekly discussions of problems\nin the philosophy of science during academic terms in the years from\n1924 to 1936. As is not uncommon with such groups, its identity is\nblurred along several edges. Not all of those who ever attended the\ndiscussions can be called members, and not all who attended did so\nover the entire period. Typically, attention is focused on long-term\nregulars who gained prominence through their philosophical\npublications, but even these do not in all cases fall into the period\nof the Vienna Circle proper. It is natural, nevertheless, to consider\nunder the heading \u201cVienna Circle\u201d also the later work of\nleading members who were still active in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.\nFinally, there is the so-called periphery of international contacts\nand visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of\nanalytical philosophers of science. In the present article the\nemphasis will be placed on the long-term regulars whose contributions\nwill be followed, selectively, into the post-Schlick era.\n\nAccording to its unofficial manifesto (see section 2.3 below), the\nCircle had \u201cmembers\u201d and recognized others as\n\u201csympathetic\u201d to its aims. It included as members, besides\nSchlick who had been appointed to Mach\u2019s old chair in Philosophy\nof the Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922, the\nmathematician Hans Hahn, the physicist Philipp Frank, the social\nscientist Otto Neurath, his wife, the mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath,\nthe philosopher Viktor Kraft, the mathematicians Theodor Radacovic and\nGustav Bergmann and, since 1926, the philosopher and logician Rudolf\nCarnap. (Even before World War I, there existed a similarly oriented\ndiscussion circle that included Frank, Hahn and Neurath. During the\ntime of the Schlick Circle, Frank resided in Prague throughout, Carnap\ndid so from 1931.) Further members were recruited among\nSchlick\u2019s students, like Friedrich Waismann, Herbert Feigl and\nMarcel Natkin, others were recruited among Hahn\u2019s students, like\nKarl Menger and Kurt G\u00f6del. Though listed as members in the\nmanifesto, Menger and Kraft later wanted to be known only as as\nsympathetic associates, like, all along, the mathematician Kurt\nReidemeister and the philosopher and historian of science Edgar\nZilsel. (Karl Popper was never a member or associate of the Circle,\nthough he studied with Hahn in the 1920s and in the early 1930s\ndiscussed its doctrines with Feigl and Carnap.) Over the years, other\nparticipants (not listed in the manifesto) included other students of\nSchlick\u2019s and Hahn\u2019s like Bela von Juhos, Josef\nSch\u00e4chter, Walter Hollitscher, Heinrich Neider, Rose Rand, Josef\nRauscher and K\u00e4the Steinhardt, a secondary teacher, Robert\nNeumann, and, as notable thinkers with independent connections, the\njurist and philosopher Felix Kaufmann (also a member of F.A. von\nHayek\u2019s \u201cGeistkreis\u201d) and the innovative\npsychologist Egon Brunswik (coming, like the even more loosely\nassociated sociologists Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda, from the\npioneering Karl B\u00fchler\u2019s University Institute of\nPsychology).\n\nDespite its prominent position in the rich, if fragile, intellectual\nculture of inter-war Vienna and most likely due to its radical\ndoctrines, the Vienna Circle found itself virtually isolated in most\nof German speaking philosophy. The one exception was its contact and\ncooperation with the Berlin Society for Empirical (later: Scientific)\nPhilosophy (the other point of origin of logical empiricism). The\nmembers of the Berlin Society sported a broadly similar outlook and\nincluded, besides the philosopher Hans Reichenbach, the logicians Kurt\nGrelling and Walter Dubislav, the psychologist Kurt Lewin, the surgeon\nFriedrich Kraus and the mathematician Richard von Mises. (Its leading\nmembers Reichenbach, Grelling and Dubislav were listed in the\nCircle\u2019s manifesto as sympathisers.) At the same time, members\nof the Vienna Circle also engaged directly, if selectively, with the\nWarsaw logicians (Tarski visited Vienna in 1930, Carnap later that\nyear visited Warsaw and Tarski returned to Vienna in 1935). Probably\npartly because of its firebrand reputation, the Circle attracted also\na series of visiting younger researchers and students including Carl\nGustav Hempel from Berlin, Hasso H\u00e4rlen from Stuttgart, Ludovico\nGeymonat from Italy, J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen, Eino Kaila, Arne\nNaess and Ake Petzall from Scandinavia, A.J. Ayer from the UK, Albert\nBlumberg, Charles Morris, Ernest Nagel and W.V.O. Quine from the USA,\nH.A. Lindemann from Argentina and Tscha Hung from China. (The reports\nand recollections of these former visitors\u2014e.g. Nagel\n1936\u2014are of interest in complementing the Circle\u2019s\nin-house histories and recollections which start with the unofficial\nmanifesto\u2014Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929\u2014and extend through\nNeurath 1936, Frank 1941, 1949a and Feigl 1943 to the memoirs by\nCarnap 1963, Feigl 1969a, 1969b, Bergmann 1987, Menger 1994.)\n\nThe aforementioned social and political engagement of members of the\nVienna Circle and of Vienna Circle philosophy for Enlightenment reason\nhad never made the advancement of its associates or proteg\u00e9es\neasy in Viennese academia. From 1934 onwards, with anti-semitism\ninstitutionalized and irrationalism increasingly dominating public\ndiscourse, this engagement began to cost the Circle still more dearly.\nNot only was the Verein Ernst Mach closed down early that year for\npolitical reasons, but the ongoing dispersal of Circle members by\nemigration, forced exile and death meant that after the murder of\nSchlick in 1936 only a small rump was able to continue meetings for\nanother two years in Vienna. (1931: Feigl emigrated to USA; 1934: Hahn\ndied, Neurath fled to Holland, 1940 to UK; 1935: Carnap emigrated to\nUSA; 1936: Schlick murdered; 1937: Menger emigrated to USA, Waismann\nto UK; 1938: Frank, Kaufmann, Brunswik, Bergmann emigrated to USA;\nZilsel, Rand to UK, later to USA; Hollitscher fled to Switzerland,\nlater to UK; Sch\u00e4chter emigrated to Palestine; 1940: G\u00f6del\nemigrated to USA; see Dahms 1995 for a chronology of the exodus.) But\nthe end of the Vienna Circle as such did not mean the end of its\ninfluence due to the continuing development of the philosophy of\nformer members (and the work of Kraft in post-World War II Vienna; on\nthis see Stadler 2008). Particularly through their work in American\nexile (esp. Carnap at Harvard, Chicago and UCLA; Feigl at Iowa and\nMinnesota; less so Frank at Harvard) and that of earlier American\nvisitors (esp. Quine, Nagel), as well as through the work of fellow\nemigr\u00e9es from the Berlin Society (esp. Reichenbach, Hempel) and\ntheir students (Hilary Putnam, Wesley Salmon), logical empiricism\nstrongly influenced the post-World War II development of analytic\nphilosophy of science. By contrast, Waismann had little influence in\nthe UK where Neurath, already marginalized, had died in 1945. (The\nfull story of logical empiricism\u2019s acculturation in the English\nspeaking world remains to be written, but see Howard 2003, Reisch\n2005, Uebel 2005a, 2010, Douglas 2009, and Romizi 2012 for considerations of\naspects of Vienna Circle philosophy early and/or late that were neglected in the process\nand remained long forgotten.)\n",
