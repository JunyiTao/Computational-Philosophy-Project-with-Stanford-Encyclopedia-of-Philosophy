    "main_text": "Influence || Relationship to Token Causation\n3.4 The Metaphysics of the Models\n\nThis section discusses what it takes for these models to be\naccurate\u2014what the world must be like to host the relations of\ninfluence described by the model. However, it must be noted that not\nevery author in the literature would be happy with the way this\nquestion is posed. Many prefer to talk about whether a model is\nappropriate or apt. This is in part because they\nrecognize that many of the models written down and used in practice\nmisrepresent the world. For instance, the models portray systems as\ndeterministic, neglecting minute quantum mechanical chances. Thus,\nHalpern writes that\n\n\nI am not sure that there are any \u201cright\u201d models, but some\nmodels may be more useful, or better representations of reality, than\nothers. (2016a: 108)\n\n\nOf course, if we are going to say that a causal model\nmisrepresents the world, we must have a prior understanding\nof what the model represents. To misrepresent is to represent\ninaccurately. This section is going to be focused on the question of\nwhat it is for a causal model to represent accurately. There is of\ncourse a further and subsequent question to be asked about when the\ninaccuracies of the model are negligible enough that the model may be\nappropriate or apt to use in a given context.\n\nIn one sense, this question should be seen as stipulative; the models\ncome from humans, not gods. It is for us to say what they do and do\nnot represent. Nonetheless, we should take care that our stipulations\ndon\u2019t undermine the purposes for which the models were designed,\nnor the use to which they are standardly put. Insofar as they are\nmeant to capture the notion of influence which appears in\ncausal claims like \u201chow much I water my plant influences how\ntall it grows\u201d, and insofar as they are meant to forge\nconnections between influence and counterfactuals\u2014or influence\nand and token causation, or influence and control, or influence and\nchance\u2014not just any stipulations will serve our purposes.\nWhether these connections are plausible or defensible will depend upon\nhow we understand the models; what we take them to be saying about the\nworld.\n\nThe formalism of the models is much the same, whether we are\nrepresenting token influence or type influence. But when it comes to\nexplaining what it takes for these models to be accurate, it will\nmatter whether we are talking about token influence or type influence.\nIn the case of token influence, Hitchcock (2001a: 283\u2013284)\nsuggests that what it takes for a causal model to be correct is for a\ncertain family of counterfactuals to be true:\n\n\nA system of structural equations is an elegant means for representing\na whole family of counterfactuals\u2026The correctness of a set of\nstructural equations\u2026depends upon the truth of these\ncounterfactuals.\n\n\nOn this kind of view, what it takes for a system of structural\nequations to correctly represent a network of token influence is for\nsome corresponding counterfactuals to be true. There is a weaker and a\nstronger version of this requirement. On the stronger version, we\nrequire that all of the (infinitely many) counterfactuals\nwhich can be derived from the model (via the interventionist\nprocedure outlined in the previous subsection) are true. On the weaker\nversion, we require only the more limited class of counterfactuals\nwhich say that, were any subset of the variables to have their values\nset via an intervention, the equations for the non-intervened\nupon variables would continue to be true. For illustration, take the\nfollowing system of equations, \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nZ &\\coloneqq X + Y \\\\\n Y &\\coloneqq X \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nThe weak requirement is that, for any values \\(x, y, z\\), the\nfollowing counterfactuals hold: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} X = x &{}\\boxto ( Y=x \\wedge Z= x + Y) \\\\\n Y = y &{}\\boxto Z = X + y \\\\\n Z = z &{}\\boxto Y = X \\\\\n (X=x \\wedge Y=y) &{}\\boxto Z= x + y \\\\\n (X=x \\wedge Z=z) &{}\\boxto Y = x \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nOne worry with the weak requirement is that the counterfactuals in (1)\nfail to capture the modularity of the structural equations. Recall:\nit\u2019s important to distinguish between the structural\nequations \\(Y \\coloneqq X\\) and \\(Z \\coloneqq X + Y\\) and the\nequations \\(Y = X\\) and \\(Z=X+Y\\). Modularity is not just the\nclaim that, if we were to intervene to set X equal to\nx, the equations \\(Y = X\\) and \\(Z=X+Y\\) would continue to be\ntrue. It is the claim that, if we were to intervene to set X\nequal to x, the structural equations \\(Y \\coloneqq\nX\\) and \\(Z \\coloneqq X + Y\\) would continue to hold. This\nrequires, at least, that the counterfactuals \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nX=x' &{}\\boxto Y=x' \\\\\n (X=x' \\wedge Y=y) &{}\\boxto Z = x' + y \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nwould still be true, for any values \\(x'\\) and \\(y\\), were we\nto intervene to set X equal to x. So it requires\nthat the nested counterfactuals \n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nX=x & {}\\boxto (X=x' \\boxto Y=x') \\\\\n X = x &{}\\boxto ((Y=y \\wedge X=x') \\boxto Z= x' + y) \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nare actually true. (And, indeed, these nested counterfactuals follow\nfrom the system of equations, on the causal modeling semantics.)\nHowever, on many semantics for counterfactuals, this nested\ncounterfactual does not follow from the counterfactuals given in\n(3.4.1) above. We might attempt to reduce nested counterfactuals like\nthese to counterfactuals with conjunctive antecedents by appeal to a\nprinciple of exportation, according to which \\(\\phi \\boxto (\\psi\n\\boxto \\chi)\\) follows from \\((\\phi \\wedge \\psi) \\boxto \\chi\\).\nHowever, on the causal modeling semantics, exportation is not valid in\ngeneral. Take the causal model above. Assuming counterfactuals with\nnecessarily false antecedents are vacuously true, \n\\[(X=x \\wedge X = x') \\boxto Y = x \\]\n\n\nwill be deemed true so long as \\(x \\neq x'\\). But \n\\[X = x {}\\boxto (X=x' \\boxto Y = x) \\]\n\n\nwill be deemed false. (See Briggs 2012, for related discussion, and\nGallow 2016, for an alternative approach.)\n\nSome think that more than a family of true counterfactuals is required\nin order for a token causal model to be correct\u2014or, at least, in\norder for a causal model to provide us with a guide to token causation\n(see\n \u00a73.3).\n Many, persuaded by the considerations from\n \u00a71.2.3\n above, include information about which variable values are more or\nless normal than which others. And Handfield et al. (2008) suggest\nthat the models must only represent relations of influence which\ncorrespond to \u201cconnecting processes\u201d, in the sense of Fair\n(1979), Salmon (1984, 1994), or Dowe (2000). The idea is this: if a\nvariable, X, shows up on the right-hand-side of\nY\u2019s structural equation, then there must be some\npossible state of the system (some possible assignment of values to\nthe variables in the model) such that, in that state, there is a\nconnecting process leading from X\u2019s value to\nY\u2019s value.\n\nWoodward (2003) focuses on systems of type influence. He\nproposes a series of non-reductive definitions which jointly\ncharacterize what it is for one type of variable, X, to\ndirectly influence another type of variable, Y, relative to a\nset of variables types, \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), which contains both X\nand Y. First, we are told:\n\n\nX directly influences Y, relative to a set of\nvariables \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), iff there is a possible intervention on\nX which will change Y when all other variables in\n\\(\\mathbf{V}\\) are held fixed at some value by interventions.\n\n\nThe definition makes reference to the notion of an\nintervention. (Notice: though Woodward is explicating the\nrelation of type influence, any particular intervention will\nbe a token occurrence.) We saw how interventions are formally\nmodeled in the previous subsection; but Woodward gives the following\ndefinition of an intervention in terms of an intervention\nvariable. We are told:\n\n\nI\u2019s assuming some value I=i is an intervention\non X (with respect to Y) iff I is an\nintervention variable for X (with respect to Y) and\nI=i is a token cause of the value taken on by X.\n\n\nThis definition relies upon the notion of an intervention\nvariable (for X with respect to Y). We are\ntold:\n\n\nI is an intervention variable for X with respect to\nY, relative to \\(\\mathbf{V}\\), iff:\n\nI influences X;\nthere are values of I such that, when I takes on\nthose values, X\u2019s value does not change when any of the\nother variables in \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) which influence X change\ntheir values; instead, the value of X is determined by the\nvalue of I alone;\nevery directed path of influence leading from I to\nY travels through X\u2014that is, if there\u2019s\nsome collection of variables \\(Z_1, Z_2, \\dots, Z_N \\in \\mathbf{V}\\)\nsuch that \\(I\\) directly influences \\(Z_1\\), \\(Z_1\\) directly\ninfluences \\(Z_2\\), \\(\\dots\\), and \\(Z_N \\) directly influences \\(Y\\),\nthen \\(X = Z_i\\), for some \\(i \\in \\{ 1, 2, \\dots, N \\}\\)\nI is statistically independent of any variable Z\nwhich directly influences Y and which is on a directed path\nof influence which does not go through X.\n\n\n\nThis definition appeals to the notion of (type) influence; so it will\nnot allow us to gives a reductive analysis of influence. But notice\nthat it doesn\u2019t appeal to influence between X and\nY\u2014and that is the relation which Woodward is attempting\nto characterize. So while the series of definitions are not reductive,\nthey are not viciously circular. They tell us something about\nhow influence between X and Y relates to influence\nbetween variables besides X and Y. (See the entry on\n causation and manipulability\n for more.)\n",
