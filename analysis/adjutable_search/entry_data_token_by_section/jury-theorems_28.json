The Athenian\ndemocracy increased the decision body compared to its oligarchic\ncompetitors, demonstrating that such an enlargement can engender\ncollective epistemic success (Ober 2008; 2013). Against this backdrop,\nthe philosophical debate about the epistemic performance of democracy\nbegan. Aristotle, for instance, despite being generally sceptical of\nthe rule by the people, concedes the possibility of group wisdom\n(Aristotle, Politics: 1281a11; Waldron 1995), though this\nreading is contested (Cammack 2013; Lane 2013).\n\nWhile the epistemic advantages of drawing on many minds had been\ndebated long before Condorcet, he is the first to develop a\nprobabilistic framework akin to modern jury theorems and to focus\nexplicitly on voting mechanisms. Condorcet\u2019s remarkable advance\nmay also have rubbed off on his contemporaries. Jean-Jacques\nRousseau\u2019s argument for popular rule was influenced by\nCondorcet\u2019s thought and resembles an informal statement of his\ntheorem, according to an influential article by Grofman and Feld\n(1988) (but see Wyckoff 2011 for a critical take on that historical\nspeculation).\n\nWhile Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem largely falls into oblivion after\nhis death, the mathematical take on aggregation which he had initiated\nremains. Francis Galton, for example, stumbles over useful data for\ntesting the epistemic performance of belief aggregation when visiting\na cattle fair in 1906. Galton observes a weight-judging competition:\nparticipants were asked to guess the slaughtering weight of an ox,\nsubmitting their guesses in writing. To Galton\u2019s surprise, the\nmedian guess was within 0.8% of the actual weight, beating by far the\nindividual judgments. While Galton does not directly invoke a jury\ntheorem, he notes that\n\n\nthe middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other\nestimate being condemned as too low or too high by a majority of the\nvoters. (Galton 1907)\n\n\nCondorcet is a founding father of social choice theory, not only\nbecause of his jury theorem. When Duncan Black (1958) famously\nrediscovers his work, his jury theorem receives new attention in\npolitical science and democratic theory (Grofman 1975 seems to have\ncoined the term \u201cCondorcet Jury Theorem\u201d). However, the\ninitial reception is not friendly: Black (1958: 163) dismisses the\nidea of an independent standard of correctness in elections and John\nRawls (1971 [1999]: 315) doubts that votes could be sufficiently\nindependent. Brian Barry (1965 [2010: 205\u20136]) is perhaps the\nfirst twentieth-century political theorist to affirm the importance of\nthe theorem for democratic theory.\n\nContemporary democratic theory remains divided on jury theorems.\nBroadly speaking, the field distinguishes between instrumental and\nprocedural arguments for democracy (Dworkin 1987; List & Goodin\n2001; Anderson 2009). Recent years have seen increasing interest in\ninstrumental, and especially epistemic arguments. But even among\nepistemic democrats (early proponents are Cohen 1986; Coleman &\nFerejohn 1986; see Schwartzberg 2015 for an overview), the merits of\njury theorems are controversial. Some epistemic democrats regard jury\ntheorems as central tools for justifying democracy (e.g., List &\nGoodin 2001; Landemore 2013; Dietrich & Spiekermann 2013a; Goodin\n& Spiekermann 2018). Others disagree. Henry S. Richardson (2002),\nfor example, rejects Condorcet\u2019s independence assumption. David\nEstlund instead rejects Condorcet\u2019s competence assumption\n(Estlund 2008: ch. 12) and dismisses Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem as\nproviding \u201ctoo shaky a basis\u201d (Estlund 2008: 223).\nElizabeth Anderson also objects to Condorcet\u2019s implausible\nassumptions and conclusions (Anderson 2006).\n\nSuch debates in political philosophy were hampered by a focus on\nCondorcet\u2019s initial version of the theorem with its problematic\nassumptions and conclusions (see\n Section 2);\n these objections often lose weight for other jury theorems.\n\nGrofman and Feld fan worries about deliberation by attributing to\nRousseau the view that \u201ceach voter is polled about his or her\nindependently reached choice, without any group deliberation\u201d\n(1988: 570). Unsurprisingly, since many democratic theorists see\npublic deliberation as instrumentally or intrinsically valuable, the\nproposal to sacrifice deliberation for independence was not met with\nenthusiasm. Recent debates in democratic theory, however, have turned\nto conditional notions of independence which can better accommodate\ndeliberation and fruitful exchange, thereby also avoiding the\ncontroversial infallibility conclusion (cf.\n Section 2\n and\n Section 4.5).\n\nSome epistemic democrats worry that an exaggerated focus on jury\ntheorems (and aggregation more generally) suppresses other important\nepistemic mechanisms, such as democratic experimentation (Anderson\n2006; Fuerstein 2008), individual learning as opposed to aggregation\n(M\u00fcller 2018), distributed search, deliberation, and learning.\nCertainly, jury theorems are only one building block; a\ncomprehensive epistemic analysis of collective decision-making also\nneeds models of such other mechanisms. Nevertheless, jury theorems can\nassist the epistemic analysis of institutions and help assess\npolitical representation, bicameralism, epistemic division of labour,\npolitical cue taking, the merits of diversity, and the dangers of\nexcessive bias, to name just a few applications (Goodin &\nSpiekermann 2018). Jury theorems have also been used to analyse legal\ninstitutions, including the importance of legal precedent and, of\ncourse, the (in)correctness of jury verdicts (e.g., Vermeule 2009;\nFeddersen & Pesendorfer 1998; Coughlan 2000).\n",
