    "main_text": "Epistemic Luck\n8. Epistemic Luck\n\nIf the problem illustrated by Gettier cases is that JTB and JTB+\nanalyses are compatible with a degree of epistemic luck that is\ninconsistent with knowledge, a natural idea is to amend one\u2019s\nanalysis of knowledge by including an explicit \u201canti-luck\u201d\ncondition. Zagzebski herself outlines this option in her 1994 (p. 72).\nUnger 1968 gives an early analysis of this kind. For example:\n\n\nS knows that p iff\n\np is true;\nS believes that p;\nS is justified in believing that p.\nS\u2019s belief is not true merely by luck.\n\n\n\nThe first thing to note about this analysis is that it is\n\u201credundant\u201d in the sense described in the previous\nsection; the fourth condition entails the first\n two.[29]\n So its surface form notwithstanding, it actually represents a\nsignificant departure from the JTB+ analyses. Rather than composing\nknowledge from various independent components, this analysis demands\ninstead that the epistemic states are related to one another in\nsubstantive ways.\n\nThe anti-luck condition, like the safety condition of the previous\nsection, is vague as stated. For one thing, whether a belief is true\nby luck comes in degrees\u2014just how much luck does it take to be\ninconsistent with knowledge? Furthermore, it seems, independently of\nquestions about degrees of luck, we must distinguish between different\nkinds of luck. Not all epistemic luck is incompatible with\nhaving knowledge. Suppose someone enters a raffle and wins an\nencyclopedia, then reads various of its entries, correcting many of\ntheir previous misapprehensions. There is a straightforward sense in\nwhich the resultant beliefs are true only by luck\u2014for our\nsubject was very lucky to have won that raffle\u2014but this is not\nthe sort of luck, intuitively, that interferes with the possession of\n knowledge.[30]\n Furthermore, there is a sense in which our ordinary perceptual beliefs\nare true by luck, since it is possible for us to have been the victim of a\nCartesian demon and so we are, in some sense, lucky not to be. But\nunless we are to capitulate to radical skepticism, it seems that this\nsort of luck, too, ought to be considered compatible with\n knowledge.[31]\n\nLike the safety condition, then, a luck condition ends up being\ndifficult to apply in some cases. We might try to clarify the luck\ncondition as involving a distinctive notion of epistemic\nluck\u2014but unless we were able to explicate that notion\u2014in\neffect, to distinguish between the two kinds of luck mentioned\nabove\u2014without recourse to knowledge, it is not clear that the\nensuing analysis of knowledge could be both informative and\nnoncircular.\n",
