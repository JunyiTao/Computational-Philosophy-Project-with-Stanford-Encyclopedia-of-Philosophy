    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Argument A Priori\n4.1 Argument A Priori\n\nClarke thought highly of the argument from design, largely because it\nis widely accessible and easily grasped. However, due to the rise of\natheistic systems of philosophy, he thought it was necessary to give\nan argument that would satisfy his fellow metaphysicians, such as the\nfollowing, presented in his first set of Boyle lectures. The Boyle\nlectures, especially Clarke\u2019s were crucial to spreading\nNewton\u2019s views. As Margaret Jacob (1977, 2) has convincingly\nargued, \u201cWithout these sermons, Newton\u2019s system of the\nworld would have remained relatively unknown, and possibly even\nfeared, by an educated and literate public on both sides of the\nChannel which could not have begun to understand the mathematical\nintricacies of the Principia.\u201d\n\nClarke tells us that his argument for the being and attributes of God\nwas done \u201cpartly by metaphysical Reasoning, and partly from\nthe Discoveries (principally those that have been lately made) in\nNatural Philosophy\u201d (W 2.581). His argument, which was\nknown in Clarke\u2019s time as \u201cthe argument a\npriori,\u201d occupies most of A Demonstration of the Being\nand Attributes of God, Clarke\u2019s first set of Boyle\nLectures. (Note that Clarke\u2019s use of the term \u201ca\npriori\u201d is not that which has been standard since Kant. The\nargument is a priori not primarily because it is available\nindependent of experience, but because it argues from the nature of\nthe cause to the nature of the effect; this is in contrast with the\nargument a posteriori which works from the effects \u2014\ne.g., the design of the world\u2014 to the cause \u2014 e.g., the\ndesigner.) The argument is typically classified today as cosmological,\nbut it should not be confused with the kalam cosmological\nargument (which takes as a premise that the world has a finite\nhistory). Clarke\u2019s version belongs to the tradition of modal\ncosmological arguments that employ the principle of sufficient reason\nto argue from a contingent series of causes to a necessary being. The\nmain lines of Clarke\u2019s \u201cargument a priori\u201d\nare as\n follows.[1]\n\nSomething now exists, so something always was (D 8, W 2.524).\nOtherwise nothing would exist now because it is impossible for\nsomething to be produced by nothing. Clarke does not explicitly\nacknowledge that \u201csomething always was\u201d is ambiguous\nbetween a stronger, de re reading and a weaker, de\ndicto reading. Because the stronger, de re claim (this\nparticular thing has always existed) seems unwarranted by the argument\nthus far and the next step of the argument is to establish that there\nis a single independent being, the more plausible and weaker de\ndicto claim (some thing or another, perhaps a succession of\nvarious things, has always existed) can be assumed.\n\nWhat has existed from eternity can only be either an independent being\n(one having in itself the reason of its existence) or an infinite\nseries of dependent beings. However, such an infinite series cannot be\nwhat has existed from eternity because by hypothesis it can have no\nexternal cause, and no internal cause (no dependent being in the\nseries) can cause the whole series. Hence, an independent being\nexists. A frequent objection to this argument is that the demand for\nan explanation is satisfied when it is conceded that each being in the\nseries has a cause (Rowe 1971, 56\u201357). The series is not a new entity\nto be explained, so there is no reason to appeal to an eternal,\nindependent being. Furthermore, if the series is not dependent, then\nit is not contingent, and if it is not contingent, then it is\nnecessary. Clarke finds this options unacceptable, as have many since\n(including Rowe 1973, 57\u201359, and van Inwagen 2014, 159\u2013182), but\nClarke\u2019s appeal to God\u2019s will to maintain the contingency of the\ncreated world has been challenged, especially by Leibniz (see 3.2,\nabove).\n\nThis independent being is \u201cself-existent, that is, necessarily\nexisting\u201d (D 12, W 2.527), a conclusion he also reaches by\narguing that space and time cannot be conceived not to exist and they\nare obviously not self-existent, so the substance on which they\ndepend, God, must exist necessarily as well (D 13, W 2.527\u2013528).\n(Clarke was criticized for assuming, rather than arguing, that space\nand time are attributes of God.) It seems that for Clarke a\n\u201cnecessary being\u201d is a being whose non-existence is\nimpossible (either because it is an independent being or is\nnecessarily dependent on an independent being), and a\n\u201cself-existent being\u201d is a being whose non-existence is\nimpossible because the necessity of its existence is to be found in\nits own nature. Once these two are distinguished, however, Clarke is\nopen to the criticism that he cannot rule out the existence of two\nself-existent beings (as he attempts in the seventh proposition)\nbecause there may be two beings who are self-existent even though only\none self-existent being is required to explain the existence of the\nworld (Law 1758, 21). Anthony Atkey (1725, 3\u201314) provided a\nvariation on this objection in correspondence. He alleges that Clarke\nillegitimately moves from the existence of at least one\n\u201cnecessary being\u201d to the existence of no more than one\n\u201cself-existent being.\u201d Clarke concludes that there\nexists only one self-existent being, but he has at best shown\nthat we cannot have the idea of two self-existent beings.\nAtkey\u2019s objection is about the relationship of the conceivable\nto the possible. Clarke\u2019s response (Atkey 1725, 17\u201319) is\nthat we have clear ideas in this case, so our ideas can guide us in\nthe nature of things (conceivability entails possibility in the case\nof clear ideas), but he does not give any reason why we should think\nour ideas are clear in this case. This problem is exacerbated by his\ndenial that we have adequate ideas of the essences of substances,\nincluding God. If we do not have adequate ideas of any substances\n(including the divine being) then how could we have a clear idea of\nGod? Roger North had previously raised a similar worry about Clarke\nneeding to show \u201cnatural things accord with our ideas,\u201d\nbut Clarke\u2019s response has not survived (NC 133).\n\nIf successful, Clarke\u2019s argument a priori establishes\nall the metaphysical attributes of God (independence, eternality,\nimmutability, infinitude, omnipresence) by examining the nature of\nnecessity and positing the contingency of the world. To reach the\npersonal and moral attributes of God, it is necessary to draw upon\nfurther features of the world and argue a posteriori (D 38, W\n2.543). Clarke attempted a variety of arguments to establish that God\nis an agent (that is, that God is not only intelligent but has a will\nthat is free in a libertarian sense). First, one real feature of the\nworld is that there are intelligent beings in it. Intelligence, being\na perfection, must exist to at least as great a degree in the cause as\nin the effect (an instance of Clarke\u2019s applying a causal version\nof the principle of sufficient reason). So God must be intelligent\n(D38\u201339, W 4.543). Second, this intelligence can be established\nfrom the order and beauty of the world, so a teleological argument can\nreach this conclusion as well. Third, Clarke claimed that\n\u201cintelligence without liberty \u2026 is really (in respect of\nany power, excellence, or perfection) no intelligence at all,\u201d\nso therefore God must be an agent. Fourth, the person positing a God\nwithout freedom (Clarke specifically mentions Spinoza) is positing a\ncontradiction and has failed to explain the source of activity in the\nworld (D 46\u201347, W 4.548\u2013549). Finally, the necessitarian\n(like Spinoza) is forced to deny a number of (to Clarke) obvious\npoints, including that things could be different than they are, that\nthere are final causes in the universe, and that there is a variety of\nfinite things in the universe (Yenter 2014).\n\nWith God\u2019s intelligence and agency in place, he sketches how\nGod\u2019s wisdom, goodness, justice, and other moral perfections can\nbe established.\n",
