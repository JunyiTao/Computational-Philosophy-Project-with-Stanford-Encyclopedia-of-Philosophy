One major theme\nin this literature is that people\u2019s conception of themselves\nvaries across cultures, and that in many non-western cultures\none\u2019s social roles and one\u2019s relation to other people play\na much more central role in people\u2019s self-concepts than they do\nin the individualistic West (Markus & Kitayama 1991; Baumeister\n1998). One very simple way of studying these differences is to ask\npeople to respond to the question \u201cWho am I?\u201d fifteen\ntimes. Non-westerners will typically mention social groups, group\nroles and relationships: \u201cI am Maasai\u201d, \u201cI am a\nperson who brings fruit to the temple\u201d, \u201cI am my\nfather\u2019s youngest son\u201d. Westerners, by contrast, will\ntypically mention personal attributes, aspirations and achievements:\n\u201cI am intelligent\u201d, \u201cI am a pre-med student\u201d,\n\u201cI am the fastest swimmer in my school\u201d (Ma &\nSchoeneman 1997). Another theme is that people\u2019s conception of\nthemselves is situationally malleable\u2014it changes depending on\nwho we are with, where we are and what we are doing (Kihlstrom &\nCantor 1984; Markus & Wurf 1987). \n\nWhile this sort of situational malleability may not be surprising, a\nnumber of psychologists have suggested a much more radical situational\nmalleability. Under certain circumstances, notably when we have a\nclose personal relationship with another person, when we are trying to\ntake the perspective of another person, or when we feel empathy for\nanother person, the conceptual boundary between the self and the other\nperson disappears; the self and the other merge. According to Arthur\nAron and colleagues,\n\n\nMuch of our cognition about the other in a close relationship is\ncognition in which the other is treated as self or confused with\nself\u2014the underlying reason being a self-other merging. (Aron et\nal. 1980: 242)\n\n\nIf this is true, then it poses a fundamental challenge to the claim\nthat helping behavior directed at someone for whom we feel empathy is\nreally altruistic. For, as Melvin Lerner memorably observed:\n\n\nIt seems that we respond sympathetically, with compassion and a sense\nof concern, when we feel a sense of identity with the victim. In\neffect, we are reacting to the thought of ourselves in that situation.\nAnd, of course, we are filled with the \u201cmilk of human\nkindness\u201d for our own sweet, innocent selves. (Lerner 1980:\n77)\n\n\nA bit less colorfully, Batson notes that for \u201cthe contrast\nbetween altruism and egoism to be meaningful\u201d, an individual\nproviding help \u201cmust perceive self and other to be distinct\nindividuals\u201d (2011: 145\u2013146). And \n\n\nif the distinction between self and other vanishes then so does the\ndistinction between altruism and egoism, at least as these terms are\nused in the empathy-altruism hypothesis. (2011: 148)\n\n\nPsychologists who have debated the rather astonishing claim that\npeople who provide help to others often lose track of the distinction\nbetween themselves and the person being helped have proposed several\ndifferent ways of determining whether this sort of \u201cself-other\nmerging\u201d has occurred. Before considering these, however, we\nshould remind ourselves of an important philosophical distinction that\nwill be crucial in assessing tests for self-other\n merging.[19]\n The distinction is often made using the labels \u201cqualitative\nidentity\u201d and \u201cnumerical identity\u201d. Qualitative\nidentity is the relation that often obtains between two TV sets\nmanufactured by the same company. They share most of their important\nproperties. Numerical identity is a relationship that obtains between\na person at one time in his life and that same person at another time\nin his life. If the time gap is substantial, the person at the earlier\ntime may differ in many ways from the person at the later time. When\nyou were a baby, you weighed less than 10 kg, spoke no language, and\ncouldn\u2019t walk. But you now are numerically the same person as\nthe baby. Numerical identity can be of enormous legal and moral\nimportance, a point nicely illustrated by the trial of John Demjanuk,\nthe Ukrainian-born auto worker who was accused of being the sadistic\nNazi concentration camp guard whose victims called him \u201cIvan the\nTerrible\u201d. The man on trial, in 1988, differed in many ways from\nthe concentration camp guard: he was much older, heavier, bald, and\nspoke English. He was obviously not even close to being qualitatively\nidentical with perpetrator of Ivan\u2019s crimes. What the court had\nto determine was not whether Ivan and Demjanuk were qualitatively\nidentical but whether they were numerically\n identical.[20]\n What makes this distinction important for present purposes is that\nthe sort of identity that is relevant to the debate between egoists\nand altruists is numerical identity, not qualitative identity. If\nSophia, at age 30, sets aside a large sum of money that will be paid\nto Sophia at age 70, young Sophia is not being altruistic. If her\nultimate goal is to ensure that old Sophia has the means to live a\ncomfortable life, then young Sophia\u2019s action is\nstraightforwardly egoistic. The take-home message here is that if a\ntest used to determine whether person A takes herself to be\nidentical to person B is to be relevant to the egoism versus\naltruism debate, the test must provide evidence that person A\ntakes herself to be numerically identical to person B,\nnot that she takes herself to be qualitatively identical to\nperson B.\n\nNow let\u2019s consider how psychologists have attempted to assess\nwhether experimental participants feel a sense of identity with\nsomeone they might be called on to help. In one of the most\ninfluential studies claiming to show that helping is often the product\nof a feeling of oneness, Cialdini et al. (1997) used a pair of\ntests.\n\n\n[P]articipants rated the extent of oneness they felt with the [person\nthey might help] by responding to two items that were combined in all\nanalyses to form a oneness index. The first item incorporated the\nInclusion of Other in Self (IOS) Scale used by Aron et al. (1992) to measure self-other\nboundary overlap. It consisted of a set of seven pairs of increasingly\noverlapping circles. Participants selected the pair of circles that\nthey believed best characterized their relationship with the [person\nthey might help]. The second item asked participants to indicate on a\n7-point scale the extent to which they would use the term we\nto describe their relationship with the [person they might help].\n(1997: 484)\n\n\nIn a critique of the Cialdini et al. paper, Batson, Sager, et al.\n(1997) used three measures of self-other merging. One was the IOS\nScale used by Cialdini et al. The second was a \u201cperceived\nsimilarity\u201d task in which \u201c[p]articipants were asked,\n\u2018How similar to you do you think the person \u2026is?\u2019\n(1 = somewhat, 9 = extremely)\u201d (1997: 500). In the third,\nparticipants rated both themselves and the target on a series of\npersonal attributes. The \u201cmeasure of merging was the mean\nabsolute difference between ratings of self and other\u201d (1997:\n498).\n\nIt does not seem that any of these four tests of self-other merging\nprovide a reason to believe that the participant views herself as\nnumerically identical with another person. Indeed, both the perceived\nsimilarity test and the personal attribute rating test seem to be\nassessing qualitative identity rather than numerical identity.  And it\nis far from clear what, if anything, the other two tests are\nmeasuring. So it seems that there is really no evidence at all that\npeople in close relationships lose track of the distinction between\nthemselves and another person. Indeed, as May notes, if someone really\ndid believe that he exists in two obviously distinct bodies, the most\nnatural conclusion to draw would be that he is delusional (May 2011b:\n32).\n\nWhile the literature on self-other merging provides little reason to\nbelieve that normal people take themselves to be numerically identical\nwith another person, it does provide a different kind of challenge to\nthe empathy-altruism hypothesis defended by Batson and his colleagues.\nThat hypothesis, it will be recalled, is that empathy often causes an\nultimate desire to help another person. But in the Cialdini et al.\n(1977) paper cited earlier, they report three studies indicating that\nempathy, though it does occur, is not playing any causal role in the\nprocess that leads to helping. Rather, they maintain, it is\n\u201cmerging\u201d\u2014which is used here as a label for whatever\nthe IOS scale and the use-of-we test measure\u2014that is\nactually leading participants to help. Though the Cialdini et al.\npaper is quite sophisticated, Batson et al. (1997) pointed out a number of\nmethodological problems. When they conducted a pair of experiments\nthat avoided these methodological problems, the role of empathy in\nproducing helping behavior was clearly evident. However, most\nexperiments exploring the link between empathy and helping behavior,\nincluding this one, use a relatively small number of participants. And\nthe \u201creplication crisis\u201d that has emerged in recent years\nhas led many to worry about the robustness of the effects reported in\nexperiments like these (Chambers 2017). McAuliffe et al. (2018) have\naddressed these concerns. Their high powered, pre-registered study,\nrun on the internet, analyzed data from 680 participants. Their\nfindings were \u201cunambiguously supportive\u201d (2018: 504) of\nthe link between empathy and helping behavior.\n",
