This section will explore the history and consequences of\nchemistry\u2019s focus on structure. The first half of this section\ndescribes chemistry\u2019s transition from a science concerned with\nelemental composition to a science concerned with structure. The\nsecond half will focus on the conceptual puzzles raised by\ncontemporary accounts of bonding and molecular structure.\n",
