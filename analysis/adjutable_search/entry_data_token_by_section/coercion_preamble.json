    "main_text": "\n\nThe concept of coercion has two different faces,\ncorresponding to the two parties involved in its most ordinary cases.\nOn one face, it picks out a technique agents (coercers) can use to get\nother agents to do or not do something. On the other face, it picks\nout a kind of reason for why agents (coercees) sometimes do or refrain\nfrom doing something. Coercion is typically thought to carry with it\nseveral important implications, including that it diminishes the\ntargeted agent\u2019s freedom and responsibility, and that it is a\n(pro tanto) wrong and/or violation of right. Nonetheless, few\nbelieve that it is always unjustified, since it seems that no society\ncould function without some authorized uses of coercion. It helps keep\nthe bloody minded and recalcitrant from harming others, and seems also\nto be an indispensable technique in the rearing of children. A\nstate\u2019s legitimacy and sovereignty is sometimes thought to\ndepend on its ability to use coercion effectively and to monopolize\nits use within its territory against competitors, both internal and\nexternal.\n\nBecause of its usefulness and its sometimes devastating effects,\ncoercion is a matter of longstanding political and ethical concern.\nNonetheless, there has been little sustained scholarly attention to\nits nature until recently; historically, many seem to have been\nwilling to accept the concept of coercion as a primitive. Since the\n1970s, however, the nature and function of coercion has come in for\nsignificant philosophical discussion. Though the pace of study has\nslowed somewhat since 1990, the nature of coercion and its effects\nremains a matter of dispute.\n\nSometimes the term \u201ccoercion\u201d is used in popular speech\nwith a quite broad sense. For instance, one hears\n\u201ccoercion\u201d used to describe social pressures (e.g., the\nneed to conform to peer expectations or to placate one\u2019s\nparents); or the constraining or manipulative effects of advertising,\none\u2019s upbringing, or the structuring of society more generally\n(e.g., the necessity of participating in a capitalist economy). It is\nalso sometimes treated as a quite general concept encompassing almost\nany sort of interpersonal infringement on one\u2019s rights. Such\nuses are not wholly foreign to philosophical discussions (see, e.g.,\nRipstein 2004). Nonetheless, the following discussion will focus on a\nnarrower sense of the term more in line with its use by major\nhistorical philosophical writers and contemporary theorists alike.\nThis usage will rule out, by stipulation, such things as mere\ndisapproval, emotional manipulation, or wheedling. (What is\n\u201cruled in\u201d is subject to dispute, as is discussed below.)\nThis minimal setting of boundaries still leaves considerable room for\ndisagreement over how best to understand coercion\u2019s workings,\nits preconditions, and its effects.\n",
