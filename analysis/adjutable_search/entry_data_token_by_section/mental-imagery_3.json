    "main_text": "What is mental imagery? || Mental imagery vs. imagination\n1.3 Mental imagery vs. imagination\n\nMental imagery is not imagination (Langland-Hassan 2015, 2020,\nArcangeli 2020). Imagination is (typically) a voluntary act. Mental\nimagery is not. Mental imagery can be, and is very often, involuntary.\nWhen we have flashbacks to an unpleasant scene, this is mental\nimagery, but not imagination by any sense of the term (see also\nGregory 2010, 2014, Wiltsher 2016 on the differences between\nimagination and mental imagery). It is involuntary mental imagery. The\nsame goes for earworms: annoying tunes that go through our head in\nspite of the fact that we really don\u2019t want them to. Again, this\nis not auditory imagination, but it is auditory mental imagery.\n\nIn spite of these differences, given that the term \u2018mental\nimagery\u2019 was not systematically used until the end of the\n19th century, throughout the history of philosophy people\nused the term \u2018imagination\u2019 to refer to what we now would\ndescribe as mental imagery. Thomas Hobbes, for example, talked about\n\u201cretaining an image of the seen thing\u201d, which comes very\nclose to at least a subcategory of the current use of mental imagery\nin psychology and neuroscience, but he referred to this mental\nphenomenon as imagination (Hobbes 1651, Chapter 2). More generally,\nboth the British empiricists and the German idealists used the term\n\u2018imagination\u2019 at least sometimes in the sense that would\nbe captured by the concept of mental imagery nowadays (see Yolton 1996\nfor a summary). If we want to understand the evolution of\nphilosophical thinking about mental imagery, we would need to go\nthrough all the historical texts about imagination and separate out\nreferences to voluntary acts (imagination proper) from references to\nmental imagery. This is not something that can be done in this\nencyclopedia entry.\n\nThe relation between mental imagery and imagination is important for\nanother reason: we have seen that we can have mental imagery without\nimagination (see the flashback and the earworm examples). But how\nabout the other way round? Can we have imagination without mental\nimagery? In other words, does imagination necessarily involve the\nexercise of mental imagery (Kind 2001, Van Leeuwen 2016,\nLangland-Hassan 2020)? This debate has been further complicated by the\nstandard distinction between sensory and propositional imagination\n(roughly, imagining seeing x versus imagining that x is F), and the\nrole imagery plays in these two forms of imagination \u2013 roughly,\nthe difference between them is that the former, but not the latter is\nnecessarily accompanied by (or constituted by) mental imagery. Without\ntaking sides or venturing into the literature on the distinction\nbetween sensory and propositional imagination, it needs to be pointed\nout that many of the arguments on either side appeal to introspection\n(Byrne 2007, Chalmers 2002). If we allow for unconscious mental\nimagery, then these arguments would not lead to any kind of conclusive\nresolution. The only way in which we can assess whether imagination\nnecessarily involves mental imagery is by empirical means.\n",
