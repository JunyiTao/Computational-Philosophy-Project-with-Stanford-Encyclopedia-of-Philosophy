    "main_text": "New approaches to fallacies || Renewed interest\n3.1 Renewed interest\n\nA common complaint since Whately\u2019s Elements of Logic is\nthat our theory and teaching of fallacies are in want of\nimprovement\u2014he thought they should be put on a more logical\nfooting to overcome the loose and vague treatments others had\nproffered.\n\nIt is on Logical principles therefore that I propose to discuss the\nsubject of Fallacies. \u2026 the generality of Logical writers have\nusually followed so opposite a plan. Whenever they have to treat of\nanything that is beyond the mere elements of Logic, they totally lay\naside all reference to the principles they have been occupied in\nestablishing and explaining, and have recourse to a loose, vague, and\npopular kind of language \u2026 [which is] \u2026 strangely\nincongruous in a professional Logical treatise. (1875, III, intro.)\n\n\nCharles Hamblin\u2019s 1970 book, Fallacies, revives\nWhately\u2019s complaint. We may view Fallacies as the\ndividing line between traditional approaches to the study of fallacies\nand new, contemporary approaches. At the time of its publication it\nwas the first book-length work devoted to fallacies in modern times.\nThe work opens with a critique of the standard treatment of fallacies\nas it was found in mid-twentieth century textbooks; then, in\nsubsequent chapters, it takes a historical turn reviewing\nAristotle\u2019s approach to fallacies and exploring the tradition it\nfostered (as in the previous section of this entry). Other\nhistorically-oriented chapters include one on the Indian tradition,\nand one on formal fallacies. Hamblin\u2019s more positive\ncontributions to fallacy studies are concentrated in the book\u2019s\nlater chapters on the concept of argument, formal dialectics, and\nequivocation.\n\nWhat Hamblin meant by \u201cthe standard treatment of\nfallacies\u201d was:\n\nThe typical or average account as it appears in the typical short\nchapter or appendix of the average modern textbook. And what we find\nin most cases, I think it should be admitted, is as debased, worn-out\nand dogmatic a treatment as could be imagined\u2014incredibly\ntradition bound, yet lacking in logic and in historical sense alike,\nand almost without connection to anything else in modern Logic at all.\n(1970, 12)\n\n\nLet us consider what came before Hamblin as the traditional approach\nto fallacies and what comes after him as new approaches. The new\napproaches (since the 1970\u2019s) show a concern to overcome\nHamblin\u2019s criticisms, and they also vie with each to produce the\nmost defensible alternative to the traditional approach. One thing\nthat nearly all the new approaches have in common is that they reject\nwhat Hamblin presents as the nearly universally accepted definition of\n\u201cfallacy\u201d as an argument \u201cthat seems to be\nvalid but is not so\u201d (1970, 12). Although this\ndefinition of fallacy is not nearly as widely accepted as Hamblin\nintimated (see Hansen 2002), others have taken to calling it\n\u201cthe standard definition of fallacies\u201d and for convenience\nwe can refer to it as SDF. SDF has three necessary conditions: a\nfallacy (i) is an argument, (ii) that is invalid, and (iii) appears to\nbe valid. These can be thought of as the argument condition, the\ninvalidity condition and the appearance condition. All three\nconditions have been brought into question.\n",
