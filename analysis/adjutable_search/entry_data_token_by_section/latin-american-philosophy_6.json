    "main_text": "Problems and Topics || The Rights of Amerindians\n3.1 The Rights of Amerindians\n\nPerhaps the oldest distinctive philosophical problem of\npost-Columbian Latin American philosophy concerns the rights of\nindigenous populations in the Americas, and the duties of those\ngovernments that claimed jurisdiction over them. In the mid-sixteenth\ncentury, there were serious reservations on the part of a number of\nphilosophers, theologians, and legal theorists concerning the validity\nof the Spanish wars of conquest. Francisco Vitoria\u2019s developments\nof just war theory were among the earliest and most lasting\nphilosophical contributions to the topic. One of the most significant\nissues for sixteenth century thinkers in Spain was whether the\nindigenous populations were natural slaves or not. Whether the Spanish\nCrown could \u201cpacify\u201d the indigenous populations through\nviolence\u2014or whether more peaceful means of persuasion and\npolitical control were necessary\u2014was perceived to turn on whether\nthe indigenous populations were natural slaves. Relatedly, the outcome\nof this dispute had implications for the duties of the Spanish Crown to\nthe indigenous population, and correspondingly, the manner in which the\nindigenous populations ought to be treated (Cante\u00f1s 2010).\n\nThe issue reached its apex in a debate between Juan Gin\u00e9s\nSep\u00falveda, who defended the Spanish Crown\u2019s right to forcibly\nimpose its legal and religious practices on the indigenous populations\nof the Americas, and Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a Dominican friar\nand the first Bishop of Chiapas. Las Casas argued for a nuanced\nreading of the idea of natural slavery, while insisting on the full\nrationality of the indigenous populations, the need for peaceful\nevangelization of those populations, and for strict limits on the\nmeans used on behalf of Spanish interest in the Americas.  The results\nof the debate were inclusive\u2014Sep\u00falveda\u2019s work was\nsuppressed for a time, but Las Casas\u2019 position on the limits of\nSpanish use of force never became officially adopted by the Spanish\nCrown. Nevertheless, Las Casas continued to play a prominent role in\nthe Spanish Imperial court, tirelessly arguing on behalf of the native\npopulations. \n\nBetween the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, perhaps the dominant\nview of Latin American philosophers (a predominantly upper class group,\ngenerally of European ancestry) tended to regard indigenous populations\nas a \u201cproblem\u201d that needed to be overcome. By the late\nnineteenth century, amidst the considerable influence of Huxley and\nSocial Darwinism, several nations had policies of encouraging\nassimilation and \u201ccivilizing\u201d of the indigenous\npopulations, oftentimes in conjunction with encouraging more\nimmigration from Europe. For philosophers and policy-makers alike,\nconcern for preserving indigenous cultural practices, language, and\npolitical autonomy was typically negligible.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the concerns and nature of indigenous\npopulations received more varied evaluations from philosophers. For\nexample, Mari\u00e1tegui (1971) argued that indigenous Peruvians were\ncollectivists, \u201cnatural\u201d communists whose economic\ndifficulties were due in large part to the ownership, distribution and\nuse of lands in Peru. In the work of Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos\n(Vasconcelos/Gamio, 1926; Vasconcelos, 1997), indigenous populations in\nthe Americas were something to be assimilated along the way towards the\nformation of a \u201ccosmic\u201d race of mixed-people. That future\npopulation, a mixed-race people, would adapt the best cultural\npractices from around the world. In the work of Enrique Dussel (1995),\nthe encounter with the Amerindian populations are philosophically\nimportant for a variety of reasons, including the formation of Europe\nas an important conceptual category, the creation of modernity, and\nwhat the interactions between conquerors and conquered reveal about the\ndifficulty of understanding the interests and concerns of other\npeoples.\n\nIn the decade leading up to 1992 (the quincentenary of the Conquest)\nintellectual discussion of indigenous peoples and their interests grew\nconsiderably. By the 1990s, there was a flourishing of philosophical\nwork, especially but not exclusively in Mexico, on issues of ethnic\nidentity and political representation of indigenous populations. Luis\nVilloro, Fernando Salmer\u00f3n, and Le\u00f3n Oliv\u00e9 were\namong the prominent contributors to those discussions.\n\nIn the first part of the twenty first century, philosophical work on\naspects of a distinctly Latin American problematic concerning race and\npolitics\n proliferated.[8]\nFor more\non some of these matters, see the section below on the Identity of\nthe People.\n",
