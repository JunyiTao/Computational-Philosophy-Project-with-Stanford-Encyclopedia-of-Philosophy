    "main_text": "The existentialist \u201csystem of the arts\u201d || Non-linguistic arts: painting and music\n10.4 Non-linguistic arts: painting and music\n\n\nThe existentialists\u2019 lack of interest in poetry (which, in the\ncase of Sartre especially, turns into outright dismissal) is based on\ntheir view that poets make a misguided use of language. For the same\nreason, the other non-discursive arts attract almost as little interest\nas poetry (however, see Camus 1951, 257). Yet, when they are discussed,\nthey are treated more favourably than poetry, since they do not have\nlanguage as their medium, and this means that the accusation against\npoetry becomes irrelevant. The emphasis on language as the eminent\nmedium for the representation of human freedom reproduces a classical\nargument that is already at the heart of Hegel\u2019s aesthetics (a\nfact that the existentialists are fully aware of [Sartre 1948a, 5]).\nThe implication for the other arts is that they are able to produce and\nconvey ideal contents, meaning and beauty, but that these are never as\ntransparently accessed as in linguistic expression. Rather, the ideal\ncontent in non-linguistic art-forms remains trapped, glued, as it were,\nin the materiality of the artwork: \u201c\u2026 it is one thing to\nwork with colour and sound, and another to express oneself by means of\nwords. Notes, colours, and forms are not signs. They refer to nothing\nexterior to themselves. (\u2026) As Merleau-Ponty has pointed out in\nThe Phenomenology of Perception, there is no quality of\nsensation so bare that it is not penetrated with significance. But the\ndim little meaning which dwells within it, a light joy, a timid\nsadness, remains immanent or trembles about like a heat mist; it\nis colour or sound\u201d (Sartre 1948a, 1).\n\n\nThis seems to introduce some important differences amongst the\nexistentialists, since Merleau-Ponty, for instance, claimed that all\nart forms function like language. But Merleau-Ponty agrees with Sartre\non the important differences between art forms. The Prose of the\nWorld established that there was a single source behind all acts\nof expression, which made them commensurable to language, only to\nacknowledge the specificity of language in a manner similar to\nSartre\u2019s. For example, the \u201cvoices\u201d in painting \u2014 a\nmetaphor for the ideal content of painting \u2014 are \u2018voices of\nsilence\u2019 that speak only an \u2018indirect language\u2019 (the\ntitles of Malraux\u2019s famous studies on the history of painting).\nThat is to say, they remain attached to their specific materiality,\nmaking the work a self-enclosed world. In Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nrepeated metaphor, every painter starts the history of painting afresh\n(1960, 309\u2013311) because the same visible world calls for an infinite\nnumber of expressive variations, each singular in its determinate\ncoherence. The history of painting, therefore, is indeed made up of\nconstant echoes and criss-crosses, with each generation revisiting the\nvisual themes and techniques of the past generations, but the\ncommunication amongst the works are haphazard, indirect, and cannot be\naccumulated. There is no progress in the history of painting. In\nlanguage, on the other hand, meanings acquired from the past are\nsedimented in current meanings and allow for the dialectic of spoken\nand speaking speech discussed earlier (Merleau-Ponty 1964b, 97-113).\nThis means that the material of literature carries with it the\nsedimented historical experiences of the lifeworlds it speaks about.\nThere is no progress in literature either, not in a sense comparable to\nscientific progress, but the novel, simply by using the language of the\nlifeworld it arises from, is a direct witness of the broader historical\nnarrative in which it is embedded. As a result, it can portray ethical\nand political situations very powerfully.\n\n\nPrecisely, the poet\u2019s sin is to treat language as though it\nwere a sound or a note; it is to treat language as a thing and to\nrevere its materiality. This ignores the nature of linguistic\nexpression, in which the signs must be traversed towards their\nsignification. The reverse error is that of Paul Klee, who, according\nto Sartre, uses colour both as sign and as object (1948a, 23). The\nexistentialist system of the arts is ordered according to the Hegelian\nprinciple where arts that involve language rule over the others,\nbecause they best express human freedom.\n\n\nIn Sartre\u2019s What is Literature? this apparent disdain\nfor the materiality of painting seems at odds with another aesthetic\nprinciple of the existentialists, namely, the capacity of art to\nwitness the obtrusiveness of the world, and, in exceptional moments of\naesthetic communion, its inhuman beauty. Indeed, in a few, smaller\ntexts of Sartre\u2019s (for example, those he wrote for exhibition\nopenings) he seems to return to this aspect of the artwork, which he\nhimself had so powerfully demonstrated in his first novel. However, it\nis true that the existentialists are more interested in the ways in\nwhich human beings sort out the entanglements of their freedom in the\nabsurd world, than in the depiction of the materiality of that world.\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s texts on the ontological grandeur of\nC\u00e9zanne\u2019s painting are not representative of existential\naesthetics generally, but reflect only that author\u2019s unique\nperspective on art and ontology.\n\n\nMusic, which in some classical systems of the arts (in Schopenhauer\nand Nietzsche, for example) is the highest and most metaphysical, also\nreceives an ambiguous treatment in existentialist aesthetics. In\nThe Myth of Sisyphus, for example, Camus seems to be saying\nthat it is the absurd art par excellence because it realises\nin the purest form what all art conscious of the absurd should be\nabout, namely, the \u201ctriumph of the flesh\u201d in the absence of\nany ultimate meaning:\n\n\n\u2026 that game the mind plays with itself according to set and\nmeasured laws takes place in the sonorous compass that belongs to us\nand beyond which the vibrations nevertheless meet in an inhuman\nuniverse. There is no purer sensation. (\u2026) The absurd man\nrecognises as his own these harmonies and these forms (Camus 1942b,\n91).\n\n\nMarcel often emphasised the extent to which music had played a\nsignificant role in his philosophical inspiration. He was famous for\nhis improvisations on classical 19th century poems, which\nhis wife noted after the Second World War. We saw earlier that Sartre\nin a famous passage of Nausea had described an encounter with\njazz music in a caf\u00e9 as a sublime experience in which the\nbeautiful inner coherence of the musical flow transcended for a moment\nthe nauseating meaninglessness of the material world. And note also de\nBeauvoir\u2019s late enthusiasm for music (in Francis and Gontier\n1979, 67).\n\n\nDespite these descriptions of music as a privileged meaningful\nexperience in an absurd world, none of the existentialists has\nundertaken any sustained analysis on the relationship between music,\nphilosophy and the existential condition. Camus interprets positively\nthe formality of music, its lack of discursivity and the abstraction of\nits relation to the world of flesh (see also his early essay in Camus\n1935\u20131936), features that the latter Merleau-Ponty interprets\nnegatively; but, in the end, the existentialist writers do not give\nmusic any detailed consideration.\n",
