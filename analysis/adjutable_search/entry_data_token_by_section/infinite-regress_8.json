    "main_text": "Transmissive and Non-Transmissive Explanations\n6. Coherence, Circularity, and Holism\n\nThe Coherentist resists regress by allowing a circular or holistic\nexplanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of at least some \\(X\\)s. This could be\nto simply allow straightforwardly circular explanations, such as that\n\\(X_1\\) is \\(F\\) in virtue of \\(X_2\\) being \\(F\\) and \\(X_2\\) is \\(F\\)\nin virtue of \\(X_1\\) being \\(F\\). But that is not the only option for\nthe Coherentist. Consider again the regress argument concerning\njustification of belief: our belief \\(p_1\\) is justified by appeal to\n\\(p_2\\), which is in turn justified by appeal to \\(p_3\\), and so on.\nThere is an assumption behind this regress: that what is to be\nexplained are the facts concerning the individual beliefs\u2014why is\nthis one justified, then why is that one justified,\netc. An epistemic Coherentist such as Bonjour (1985) rejects this\nassumption. It is not, primarily, individual beliefs that are\njustified, it is systems of belief. A particular belief is\njustified only in a derivative sense, by belonging to a justified\nsystem. A system of belief is justified because of the properties of\nthe system as a whole, namely that the beliefs in it form a coherent\nsystem. Thus, justification is a holistic phenomenon: a collection of\nbeliefs is justified because of what they, collectively, are like, not\nbecause of what each individual member of the system is like. This\nholistic explanation of where justification comes from is very\ndifferent from a circular explanation: a circular explanation tells us\nthat one individual\u2019s being \\(F\\) explains another\u2019s being\n\\(F\\) and also vice versa, but a holistic explanation tells us to\nabandon the idea of explaining an individual\u2019s being \\(F\\) by\nappeal to another individual being \\(F\\), and instead hold that the\nexplanation for some things being \\(F\\) can be the facts\nconcerning what that collection of things as a whole is like. (An\nanalogous view concerning Metaphysical Coherentism and holistic\nexplanation is defended by Thompson (2018), and Cameron (2022, Ch.4).\nCf. Barnes (2018).)\n\nSometimes a circular explanation might be warranted because we are not\ntrying to explain in virtue of what the \\(X\\)s are \\(F\\), but rather\nwe are merely attempting to illuminate the \\(X\\)s being \\(F\\) by\nshowing how the \\(X\\)s relate. Consider the regress argument against\nthe thesis that time passes given by J.J.C. Smart (1949, 484):\n\n\nIf time is a flowing river we must think of events taking time to\nfloat down this stream, and if we say \u2018time has flowed faster\ntoday than yesterday\u2019 we are saying that the stream flowed a\ngreater distance today than it did in the same time yesterday. That\nis, we are postulating a second timescale with respect to which the\nflow of events along the first time dimension is measured \u2026\nFurthermore, just as we thought of the first time dimension as a\nstream, so will we want to think of the second time dimension as a\nstream also; now the speed of flow of the second stream is a rate of\nchange with respect to a third time dimension, and so we can go on\nindefinitely postulating fresh streams without being any better\nsatisfied.\n\n\nHere we start with our ordinary temporal dimension\u2014what we may\nhave supposed to be the only temporal dimension\u2014the one\nphilosophers have in mind when they say that time passes. Smart\nsupposes that if this dimension of time indeed passes then there must\nbe a rate at which it\n passes.[14]\n Whether that rate can slow down or speed up or if time always flows\nat the same rate is not important, but there must be some rate at\nwhich it passes, thinks Smart. Now, just as we would measure the speed\nof a car, say, by measuring how much distance it covers in a given\namount of time, so, thinks Smart, we would have to measure the speed\nat which time itself passes by measuring how much time passes in a\ngiven amount of time of some second temporal dimension. While the car\ncovers forty miles of road in the space of an hour, an hour of time\npasses in the space of, say, two hours of this second temporal\ndimension. But then, how fast does this second dimension of time pass?\nWe need a third temporal dimension to measure how long it takes for an\nhour of the second temporal dimension to pass. But how fast does the\nthird temporal dimension pass? And so on, ad infinitum. Smart\nconcludes that time does not pass.\n\nA defender of the view that time passes could attempt to resist\nSmart\u2019s regress by cutting off the regress at the second stage\nby claiming that there is a principled difference between the first\ntemporal dimension and the second that results in the first temporal\ndimension passing at some rate, but not the second. Smart himself\nconcludes that time does not pass, so can hardly object to the\npostulation of temporal dimensions that do not pass. However,\nSmart\u2019s regress can be resisted without abandoning the principle\nthat all temporal dimensions pass at some rate.\n\nNed Markosian (1993) points out that to give a rate is to compare two\ndifferent types of change. When we say that the car travels at forty\nmph, we are comparing one type of change\u2014the car started off in\none place and ended up forty miles distant\u2014with another\u2014it\nwas one time and it is now an hour later. In that case, we can always\nget the rate of the second type of change by comparing back to the\nfirst. As Markosian says (ibid., 842): \u201cIf \u2026 I tell you\nthat Montana\u2019s passing totals increased at the rate of 21 passes\nper game, then I have also told you that the games progressed at the\nrate of one game per 21 completions by Montana.\u201d So suppose we\nsay that the first temporal dimension passes at a rate of one hour for\nevery two hours of the second temporal dimension; there is no need to\ninvoke a third temporal dimension in order to state the rate at which\nthe second passes, for we have already given that rate: an hour of the\nsecond temporal dimension passes for every half hour of the first.\nIndeed, as Markosian points out, we need not even invoke a second\ntemporal dimension, for any time we give a rate of any ordinary\nprocess with respect to time\u2014such as that the Earth goes around\nthe sun once every year\u2014we have thereby stated the rate at which\ntime passes with respect to those ordinary processes: time passes at\nthe rate of one year for every orbit of the Earth around the sun.\n\nMarkosian\u2019s maneuver is possible because in giving the rate of\none process of change by appeal to a second process of change we are\nnot saying what makes it the case that the first change\noccurs at the rate it does. What makes it the case\u2014what are the\nontological grounds of the fact\u2014that the car travels at 40 mph?\nNot that an hour of time passes while the car moves a distance of 40\nmiles, for that is merely a re-description of the fact in question: a\nway of describing the rate. In the case of time itself,\ndefenders of the view that time passes may plausibly claim that what\nmakes it the case that time passes is simply the nature of\ntime: that it is in its nature to pass at the rate it does. It\ndoesn\u2019t pass at the rate it does because of some\nrelation it stands in, either to ordinary processes of change or to a\nsecond temporal dimension. Such relations allow us to informatively\nstate the rate of change, they do not provide the\ngrounds for it.\n\nIf we were providing the metaphysical grounds of rates of change,\nSmart might be right that this would lead to a vicious regress, since\narguably grounding is asymmetric (see e.g., Rosen 2010,\n 115).[15]\n If the car travels at the speed it does in virtue of\nsomething to do with the passage of time then, arguably, time cannot\npass at the rate it does in virtue of anything to do with the\nspeed of the car, and so we need to appeal to the passage of a second\ntemporal dimension to provide the ontological grounds of the rate of\npassage of the first. If the passage of this second temporal dimension\ngrounds facts about the passage of the first temporal dimension, it\nitself cannot pass in virtue of facts concerning the passage\nof the first, and so we need to appeal to a third temporal dimension,\nand so on. And even if we hold that it\u2019s possible for\nthere to be infinitely descending chains of grounds, it seems absurd\nin this case to suppose that there are in fact infinitely many\ntemporal dimensions. But that is not what is going on. When we explain\nthe speed of the car by appeal to the passage of time, we\u2019re not\nproviding the ontological grounds of its speed, we\u2019re simply\nshowing a connection between two things: the movement of the car and\nthe passage of time. Likewise for the rate of time\u2019s passage\nitself: we are not seeking to provide the ontological grounds of\ntime\u2019s passage in stating its rate, for the ontological grounds\nare plausibly just the nature of time itself. Rather, when we compare\nthe two changes, we are simply trying to illuminate one or both of\nthose changes by pointing to the way they relate. That is the only\nsense in which one explains the rate of one change when\ncomparing it to another kind of change: the mutual connection tells us\nsomething enlightening about each. It is not to give a metaphysical\nexplanation in the sense of providing the metaphysical\ngrounds of either rate of change. Compare: if I tell you that\nthe value of a US dollar is 0.7 British pounds (and therefore\nthat the value of a British pound is 1.43 US dollars), this is not to\nsay that the US dollar has the worth that it has in virtue of\nstanding in this relation to the British pound. The US dollar relates\nthus to the British pound because of what they are each\nworth; they are not worth what they are in virtue of standing in that\nrelationship. What makes it the case that the US dollar is worth what\nit is is some incredibly complex set of facts concerning economics,\nmonetary policy, etc. To give an exchange rate is not to give the\ngrounds of the value of the currencies, but merely to say something\nsubstantive about each value by stating their connections. Likewise\nwith rates of change, which is why Markosian is able to resist\nSmart\u2019s regress in this manner. Coherentist explanations might\nbe controversial when it comes to providing ontological grounds, but\nthey are less so when it comes to simply casting light on the nature\nof some phenomena by showing how they connect. So whether a regress\nargument even gets going will depend on the explanatory ambitions of\nthe view being targeted.\n",
