    "main_text": "First Case Study: Confirming Scientific Theories || Quantitative Confirmation & The Raven Paradox\n1.3 Quantitative Confirmation & The Raven Paradox\n\nRecall the raven paradox: the hypothesis that all ravens are black is\nlogically equivalent to the hypothesis that all non-black things are\nnon-ravens. Yet the latter would seem to be confirmed with each\ndiscovery of a non-black, non-raven\u2026red shirts, blue\nunderpants, etc. Yet examining the contents of your neighbor\u2019s\nclothesline doesn\u2019t seem a good way to research an\nornithological hypothesis. (Nor does it seem a good way to treat your\nneighbor.)\n\nThe classic, quantitative solution originates with\nHosiasson-Lindenbaum (1940). It holds that the discovery of blue\nunderpants does confirm the hypothesis that all ravens are black, just\nby so little that we overlook it. How could blue underpants be\nrelevant to the hypothesis that all ravens are black? Informally, the\nidea is that an object which turns out to be a blue pair of underpants\ncould instead have turned out to be a white raven. When it turns out\nnot to be such a counterexample, our hypothesis passes a weak sort of\ntest. Does our formal theory of confirmation vindicate this informal\nline of thinking? The answer is, \u201cyes, but\u2026\u201d.\n\nThe \u2018but\u2026\u2019 will prove crucial to the fate of\nNicod\u2019s Criterion (spoiler: outlook not good). But let\u2019s\nstart with the \u2018yes\u2019.\n\nWe vindicate the \u2018yes\u2019 with a theorem: discovering an\nobject to be a non-raven that isn\u2019t black, \\(\\neg R \\wedge \\neg\nB\\), just slightly boosts the probability of the hypothesis that all\nravens are black, \\(H\\), if we make certain assumptions. Here\nis the theorem (see the\n technical supplement\n for a proof):\n\nTheorem (Raven Theorem). If (i) \\(p(\\neg R \\mid \\neg\nB)\\) is very high and (ii) \\(p(\\neg B\\mid H)=p(\\neg B)\\), then\n\\(p(H\\mid \\neg R \\wedge \\neg B)\\) is just slightly larger than\n\\(p(H)\\).\n\nThe first assumption, that \\(p(\\neg R \\mid \\neg B)\\) is very high,\nseems pretty sensible. With all the non-ravens in the world, the\nprobability that a given object will be a non-raven is quite high,\nespecially if it\u2019s not black. The second assumption is that\n\\(p(\\neg B\\mid H)=p(\\neg B)\\). In other words, assuming that all\nravens are black doesn\u2019t change the probability that a given\nobject will not be black. This assumption is more controversial\n(Vranas 2004). If all the ravens are black, then some of the things\nthat might have been black aren\u2019t, namely the ravens. In that\ncase shouldn\u2019t \\(p(\\neg B\\mid H) < p(\\neg B)\\) instead? On\nthe other hand, maybe all the ravens being black doesn\u2019t reduce\nthe number of black things in the universe. Maybe it just means that\nother kinds of things are black slightly more often. Luckily, it turns\nout we can replace (ii) with less dubious assumptions (Fitelson 2006;\nFitelson and Hawthorne 2010; Rinard 2014). But we can\u2019t do with\nno assumptions at all, which brings us to two crucial points about\nconfirmation and probability.\n\nThe first point is that Nicod\u2019s Criterion fails. Assumptions\nlike (i) and (ii) of the Raven Theorem don\u2019t always hold. In\nfact, in some situations, discovering a black raven would actually\nlower the probability that all ravens are black. How could\nthis be? The trick is to imagine a situation where the very discovery\nof a raven is bad news for the hypothesis that all ravens are black.\nThis would happen if the only way for all the ravens to be black is\nfor there to be very few of them. Then stumbling across a raven would\nsuggest that ravens are actually plentiful, in which case they\naren\u2019t all black. Good (1967) offers the following, concrete\nillustration. Suppose there are only two possibilities:\n\n\n\nAll ravens are black, though there are only \\(100\\) ravens and a\nmillion other things.\n\n\nThere is one non-black raven out of \\(1,000\\) ravens, and there are a\nmillion other things.\n\n\nIn this case, happening upon a raven favors \\(\\neg H\\) because \\(\\neg\nH\\) makes ravens ten times less exotic. That the raven is black fits\nslightly better with \\(H\\), but not enough to outweigh the first\neffect: black ravens are hardly a rarity on \\(\\neg H\\). This is the\n\u2018but\u2026\u2019 to go with our earlier\n\u2018yes\u2019.\n\nThe second point is a far-reaching moral: that the fates of claims\nabout confirmation often turn crucially on what assumptions we make\nabout the values of \\(p\\). Nicod\u2019s criterion fails in situations\nlike Good\u2019s, where \\(p\\) assigns a lower value to \\(p(R \\wedge\nB\\mid H)\\) than to \\(p(R \\wedge B\\mid \\neg H)\\). But in another\nsituation, where things are reversed, Nicod\u2019s Criterion does\napply. Likewise, a diagnosis of the raven paradox like the standard\none only applies given certain assumptions about \\(p\\), like\nassumptions (i) and (ii) of the Raven Theorem. The probability axioms\nalone generally aren\u2019t enough to tell us when Nicod\u2019s\nCriterion applies, or when confirmation is small or large, positive or\nnegative.\n",
