    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition || Mental Proliferation\n3.3 Mental Proliferation\n\n\nOrdinary mentation is bound up with expectations, judgments, and \ndesires. The Buddhist philosophical term used for describing the \nstate of ordinary mentation is prapa\u00f1ca (lit. \n\u2018fabrication,\u2019 usually translated as \u2018conceptual \nproliferation\u2019)[see Samyutta Nik\u0101ya, IV, 72]. We \ndon't simply apprehend an object. Rather, we apprehend it as the \nlocus of a multiplicity of associations: in seeing a tree we perceive\nan entity made of trunk, branches, and foliage but also something \nthat can provide shade and lumber. In perception we are ordinarily \nassailed by a stream of conceptualizing tendencies, which have their \nultimate source in linguistic conventions and categorizing practices.\nThese conceptualizing tendencies overwhelm and distort the perceptual\nexperience.\n\n\nIn the canonical literature conceptual proliferation is associated \nwith sensory activity rather than consciousness [see Samyutta \nNik\u0101ya, I, 100, IV, 52; Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, I, \n65]. These proliferating tendencies, which are sustained by a \nconstant flow of sense impressions, give rise to the common sense \nconceptual schema that informs our ordinary, habitual coping \npractices. Thus cognition, in its perceptual aspect, has a dual form:\nsubjectively, it discloses a bare consciousness that merely attends \nto the flow of sensations; objectively, it corresponds to each \nspecific domain of empirical awareness: visual objects to visual \nawareness, sounds to auditory awareness, etc.\n\n\nAn inevitable outcome of this dual aspect view of perception is the \ntendency of most Buddhist philosophy of mind toward metaphysical \nidealism, since the diversity and manifoldness of the perceived world\nsuggest not a rich and variegated ontology, but a profligate mind. \nAlternatively, the Buddhist philosophy of mind could be interpreted \nas a type of phenomenology, since it argues that empirical awareness \nopens us to a world that is not entirely free from our own mental \npropensities (see \n \u00a75.4\n and \n \u00a76.3).\n It is primarily on account of this proliferating tendency of the \nordinary mind that notions such as self and other are superimposed \nupon the constant flow of phenomena. Such superimpositions are the \nmain cause for the reification of perceptual content, leading to the \nall too familiar propensity to operate with notions such as existence\nand non-existence, self and other. As the Abhidharma traditions \nmaintain, concepts are superimposed upon the constant flow of \nphenomena in dependence upon the presence or absence of stimuli at \nthe sense-doors.\n",
