    "main_text": "Extensions || Phenomenology\n3.5 Phenomenology\n\nSchutz\u2019s philosophical targeting of the social world had its\nrepercussions upon phenomenology, particularly in his critique near\nthe end of his career of Husserl\u2019s account (also referred to as\na \u201ctranscendental constitution\u201d) of how the other person\ncomes to appearance in consciousness. In \u201cThe Problem of\nTranscendental Intersubjectivity in Husserl,\u201d Schutz first\nobjected when Husserl in his Fifth Cartesian Mediation prepared the\nground for the other\u2019s appearance in consciousness by the\nmethodology of screening off everything that referred to other minds.\nHusserl had begun the Cartesian Meditations by reflectively\nabstaining from believing in the existence of what appeared in\nexperience in order to refrain from any dogmatic suppositions, but\nsince this first epoch\u00e9, or phenomenological\nreduction, still left meanings with intersubjective references, the\nscreening off methodology, or second epoch\u00e9, became\nnecessary. For Husserl, one\u2019s actual or potential experiences\nof correlates that were not properly of the ego still would\nbelong to one\u2019s sphere of ownness, but one had to seek to\nexclude any reference those correlates, as products of the\nsense-determining of other subjectivities, might have to those other\nsubjectivities. For Schutz, however, insofar as those experiences of\nwhat was not properly of the ego, supposedly confined within the\nsphere of ownness, had their origin in the intersubjective world of\neveryday life that higher level phenomenological reflection\npresupposed, it seemed difficult to see how one could exclude from\nsuch correlates any reference to the sense-determininng of other\nsubjectivities. It was as though Husserl was striving for a\ntheoretical detachment that the ontological origins of theory would\nnot allow. In addition, for Schutz the very consciousness of another\ninevitably instituted a relationship with her. Husserl\u2019s\nargument in the Fifth Meditation continued by affirming that a\nnon-ratiocinative \u201cpairing\u201d occurred through which one\ntransferred the sense \u201canother living body\u201d to another.\nOne could then verify that the other\u2019s living body was like\none\u2019s own if it continued manifesting behavior congruent with\nwhat one would expect of a living body. Schutz challenged this\nsense-transfer, however, since one experienced the other\u2019s body\nfrom the outside, unlike one\u2019s own, which was given interiorly\n(but might the similarities suffice for the transfer?), and he\nsuggested that verification through what was \u201ccongruent\u201d\nbehavior drew on social-world presuppositions of how bodies ought to\nbehave. Finally, he questioned whether the philosopher, refraining\nfrom belief in the existence of the world or others and entering into\na certain reflective solitude, could ever experience the\ntranscendental community of which Husserl spoke, since she only\nconstituted the world for herself and not for all other transcendental\negos. Intersubjectivity, Schutz concluded, was a matter of everyday\nlife to be simply described and not to be constituted within the\ntranscendental sphere of a self-reflective consciousness giving an\naccount of how the other comes to appearance. Just as Schutz had\nargued that the social world dictated the methods for its own social\nscientific investigation, so here it seemed to prescribe to\nphenomenology the approach appropriate to its description.\n\nIn the last thirteen years of his life, Schutz was preparing a\ncomprehensive phenomenology of the natural attitude, and one\nmanuscript, edited by Richard Zaner, was posthumously published as\nReflections on the Problem of Relevance, and another,\nco-authored by Thomas Luckmann, appeared as The Structures of the\nLife World. The former book distinguishes different sets of\ninterests, or relevances: topical (which focus attention on themes),\ninterpretive (which confer meanings on experiences or objects), and\nmotivational. Such relevances often involve a subject, with more or\nless systematic interests, or relevances, interacting with the world,\nand from this interaction between subject and world, it becomes\nevident what is \u201cof relevance\u201d to an actor. These\nrelevances, interdependent on each other and conjoined with\none\u2019s system of types or categories, constitute a stock of\nknowledge, which Schutz examines in terms of its genesis and\nstructure. He further explores the meaning of one\u2019s biographical\nsituation, including types and relevances, one\u2019s body, and the\nontological constraints of space and time that, for instance, prevent\none from being at certain places at certain times or compel one to\nwait (for salt to dissolve in water).\n\nThe Structures of the Life-World represents a most complex\nand thorough restatement of many of the themes Schutz addressed\nthroughout his life. After a more general account of the life-world\nand its relation to the sciences, the book takes up its various\nstratifications, such as provinces of meaning, temporal and spatial\nzones of reach, and social structure. Schutz and Luckmann then comment\non the components of one\u2019s stock of knowledge, including learned\nand non-learned elements, relevances and types, and trace the build-up\nof such a stock. The authors study the social conditioning of\none\u2019s subjective stock of knowledge and inquire about the social\nstock of knowledge of a group and different possible combinations of\nknowledge distribution (generalized and specialized). They consider\nhow subjective knowledge becomes embodied in a social stock of\nknowledge and how the latter influences the former. In addition, the\nauthors pursue such issues as the structures of consciousness and\naction, the choosing of projects, rational action, and forms of social\naction, whether such action be unilateral or reciprocal, immediate or\nmediate. A final section analyzes the boundaries of experience,\ndifferent degrees of transcendencies (from simply bringing an object\nwithin reach to the experience of death), and the mechanisms for\ncrossing boundaries (e.g. symbols).\n",
