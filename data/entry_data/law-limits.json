    "preamble": "\n\nA central\u2014perhaps the central\u2014question of the\nphilosophy of law concerns the relationship between law and morality.\nThe concern breaks down into many issues, both conceptual and\nevaluative. Among the evaluative issues is the question of obedience\nto law: does the fact that some norm is a legal norm provide any\nreason to obey it? (Green 2004 [2012]; Delmas & Brownlee 2021). By\ncontrast, conceptual or analytical issues include the identification\nof conditions necessary for the existence of a legal system,\nirrespective of the system\u2019s goodness or otherwise. Must some\nreference to morality enter into an adequate definition of law or\nlegal system? (Hart 1963 [1982]; Dickson 2012). And so on.\n\nThe present topic, the question of the limits of law, is\nwidely understood to be one of the important evaluative\nquestions, revolving around the legal enforcement of\nmorality. In the nineteenth century John Stuart Mill proposed\n\u201cthe harm principle\u201d as his answer; in the late twentieth\ncentury H.L.A Hart adopted a significantly modified version of\nMill\u2019s principle and further important versions of the harm\nprinciple followed in the hands of Joel Feinberg and Joseph Raz\n(Sections 4\u20136 below). The harm principle in all its\nmanifestations has encountered strong resistance, most notably from\n\u201clegal moralists\u201d (Sections 1\u20133) and remains in the\neyes of many the focus of debate, the view to adopt, supplement or\nmodify (as some would say), or to beat and replace (as others would\nsay).\n\nA more recent strand to the question of the legal enforcement of\nmorality is Rawlsian in origin, most notably the claim that\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice should be\nsubject to a constraint of public reason (Section 7). An\nalternative perspective challenges the assumption that the limits of\nlaw is simply an evaluative question focussed on law as a\nneutral instrument put to good ends and bad. It takes the limits of\nlaw as in part a conceptual question. Law of its nature has\nan internal morality of its own, so it is claimed, with its own\nbuilt-in limits (Section 8). A further question relates to the\ndeployment by the law of techniques beyond coercion (Section 8).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Legal Moralism: Formulation and Structure\n\nLegal moralism is an initially simple and natural position to take in\ndelineating the legitimate boundaries of the legal use of coercion. At\nits heart is a strong link between moral wrongdoing and legal\n(especially criminal) wrongdoing. In the 1960s Herbert Hart applied\nthe label \u201clegal moralist\u201d to his intellectual sparring\npartner, Lord Patrick Devlin, and the label stuck (Hart 1963; Devlin\n1965). Devlin\u2019s account, which we come to below, has led to\nnumerous responses; beyond Hart himself a sample might include: Rostow\n(1960), Ronald Dworkin (1965), Ten (1972), Feinberg (1987), Kane\n(1994), Jeffrie Murphy (1999), Gerald Dworkin (1999), Kekes (2000),\nNussbaum (2004, 2010), Wall (2013). While many of the responses to\nDevlin have been heavily critical, the approach is alive and well and\ncontinues to develop in the hands, among others, of self-declared\nlegal moralists, such as Michael Moore and Antony Duff (Duff 2016: 96,\n2018; Moore 1997, 2014) and in writers who seem at least broadly\nfavourably disposed (Tadros 2016a: 169\u2013170). Something akin to\nit is also found implicit in a vast range of legal writing.\n\nLegal Moralism is often formulated in terms of immorality as a\nsufficient condition for legal coercion. Hart asks whether\nthe fact that conduct is immoral is \u201csufficient to justify\nmaking that conduct punishable by law?\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982:4]).\nLarry Alexander similarly defines legal moralism as \u201cthe\nposition that immorality is sufficient for criminalization\u201d\n(Alexander 2003: 131). Joel Feinberg\u2014mindful of the possibility\nthat a legal moralist might want to excise from the picture certain\nkinds of immorality\u2014defines legal moralism without mention of\nsufficient conditions:\n\n\nit can be morally legitimate to prohibit conduct on the\nground that it is inherently immoral, even though it causes neither\nharm nor offence to the actor or to others. (Feinberg 1984: 27,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nHowever, Hart\u2019s and Alexander\u2019s formulations are at best\nmisleading as characterizations of legal\n moralism;[1]\n and Feinberg\u2019s is incomplete by the measure of his own\nformulations of rival positions. What both leave out is the important\npoint that immorality or wrongdoing is generally taken by legal\nmoralists to be a prima facie or pro tanto ground\nfor the imposition of legal coercion, subject to potential defeat by\nother\n factors.[2]\n That certain conduct is by common standards immoral gives the\nsociety, in Devlin\u2019s view, \u201cprima facie right to\nlegislate\u201d (Devlin 1965: 11). The immorality is certainly a\nvalid reason for criminalization, but such a reason will fail to be\nconclusive if unable to override a series of potential defeating\nfactors that Devlin outlines. Accordingly, the\n\n\nappointed law makers of society have the duty to balance conflicting\nvalues\u2026and to form a judgement according to the merits of each\ncase. (Devlin 1965: 117)\n\n\nDevlin identifies a series of \u201cfactors which should restrict the\nuse of the criminal law\u201d, even where an immorality or moral\nwrong has been identified (Devlin 1965: viii). Balances must be struck\nas between \u201cfactors of principle\u201d and \u201cfactors of\nexpediency\u201d (we examine some of these in the next section).\nHence it will often be the case that the posited wrongness or\nimmorality will not be a sufficient ground for legal\ncoercion.\n\nAs far as Feinberg\u2019s formulation is concerned, it is perhaps\nrevealing to contrast his formulation of the harm principle (which we\ndiscuss below in\n section 4)\n with his formulation of legal moralism cited above.\n\n\nHarm to others: It is always a good reason in support of\npenal legislation that it would be effective in preventing\n(eliminating, reducing) harm to persons other than the actor (the one\nprohibited from acting) and that there is probably no other\nmeans that is equally effective at no greater cost to other\nvalues. (Feinberg 1984: 26, emphasis added)\n\n\nIn formulating his harm principle, Feinberg is careful to qualify his\ncentral claim with conditions relating to what would be\n\u201ceffective\u201d and of what the \u201ccost\u201d may be to\n\u201cother values\u201d. Not so, however, when he formulates legal\nmoralism. This may be no more than an oversight. However,\nconsiderations of the sort\u2014potential\n\u201ceffectiveness\u201d, \u201ccost to other\nvalues\u201d\u2014are central to legal moralists as will be seen in\nthe next section (Devlin 1965; Moore 1997: 663\u2013665). Stressing\nthese, as regards the harm principle, but omitting them, as regards\nlegal moralism, leaves the unfair impression that the former has a\nsubtlety and a realism that the latter lacks. Furthermore,\nFeinberg\u2019s formulation makes wrongdoing or immorality sound like\nsomething of an afterthought or a factor of only marginal importance\nto the criminalization question. The legal moralist by contrast sees\nwrongdoing or immorality not as marginal or in play only after harm\nand offence have had their due, but as central or pivotal. Wrongs, as\nDevlin would have it, \u201cshape\u201d crimes. Of the best\nknown\u2014murder, rape, battery, theft, fraud, arson\u2014so called\nmala in se\u2014we should say \u201ca moral idea shapes the\ncontent of the law\u201d (Devlin 1965: 27). It is true, the moralist\nwill say, that while these crimes are shaped by morality, the criminal\noffence of, say, murder is not identical to the moral wrong of murder\nas law will import various other requirements, of legality and so on;\nfor example the law\n\n\nmust trim the edges so that they present a line sharp enough for the\nclear acquittal or condemnation which the administration of justice\nrequires. (Devlin 1965: 27)\n\n\nThe wrongdoing is, however, essential. Hence the legal moralist takes\nmurder, fraud etc as ripe for criminalization because they are\nwrongful. They may (or may not) be wrongful because harmful;\nbut from the fact that harms form a significant subset of wrongs, we\nshould not be tempted to put the cart before the horse. Harms matter a\ngreat deal, but this is because they are often a kind of wrong. As\nDevlin\u2019s fellow legal moralist Michael Moore puts it\n\n\nwe care about harm to non-consenting victims because to cause such\nharms (and sometimes, to fail to prevent them) breaches our moral\nobligations. (Moore 1997: 649)\n\n\nIf one were to revise Feinberg\u2019s definition of legal moralism so\nas to be symmetrical with his definition of the harm principle one\nwould get something closer to the essence of the position: It is\n(always or sometimes) a good reason in support of penal legislation\nthat it would be effective in preventing (eliminating, reducing)\nwrongs and that there is probably no other means that is equally\neffective at no greater cost to other\n values.[3]\n\nLegal moralism, then, broadly comes in two parts, first, a wrong or\nimmorality is identified and, second, a set of countervailing factors\nare considered; and considered with the aim of reaching an\nall-things-considered-judgement on whether legal coercion should be\ndeployed. The wrong may be strong enough to see off the countervailing\nfactors, as the case may be, or the factors may be powerful enough to\ndefeat the wrong, all things considered. Thus, some wrongs will be\ntolerable, according to this position, and some will be intolerable.\nBeyond this core of the position, legal moralist accounts diverge\nsignificantly. Moore takes a specific philosophy of punishment, a form\nof retributivism, as an essential component of his account (Moore\n1997). Duff argues that only a subset of moral wrongs should be\ncriminalizable\u2014public, not private wrongs (Duff 2016, 2018).\nTadros, whose relationship to legal moralism is complex, also excludes\na subset of moral wrongs as potentially criminalizable, for example\n\u201cless serious wrongs committed in families\u201d (Tadros 2016a:\n131). Against this Moore accepts there is initially reason to\ncriminalize all kinds of morally wrongful conduct\u2014even\nbreach of contract or treachery among friends\u2014and leaves it to\nthe second part of the structure mentioned above, the countervailing\nfactors, to block the absurdity of criminalizing such conduct (Moore\n1997, 2016). There is also considerable variation between legal\nmoralists as to how \u201cmorality\u201d is to be understood.\nNotably, Devlin\u2019s understanding of morality is widely rejected\nby his successors. Below the flexibility of the approach will be\nemphasized. We return to the question of how the\n\u201cmorality\u201d in \u201clegal moralism\u201d is to be\nunderstood in\n section 3.\n2. Legal Moralism: Restrictive Factors that Can Defeat Prima Facie Wrongs\n2.1 Privacy\n\nThe defeating factors most heavily stressed by Devlin and Moore are\nprivacy and liberty (Devlin 1965: 16\u201320; Moore 1997:\n76\u201378). As far as privacy is concerned, consider adultery and\nfornication. Adultery remains a criminal offence in parts of the world\nincluding certain US states (Rhode 2016). Devlin takes the\nwrongfulness of adultery for granted, but nevertheless holds it\ninappropriate to criminalize it. Jeffrie Murphy reaches the same\nconclusion despite saying, along the same lines as Devlin:\n\n\nIt does not strike me as absurd\u2026to suggest that the sexual\nrevolution of the 60s, and the resulting freedom many men felt to\nabandon their marriages and family responsibilities for sexual and\nother forms of so-called self-fulfilment, generated considerable\nsocial harm\u2014particularly for women and children. (J. Murphy 2006\n[2012: 70])\n\n\nFrom considerations like this there may be a prima facie\nground to criminalize in some circumstances such moral wrongs, but the\nconduct\u2014all things considered\u2014should not be criminal in\nDevlin\u2019s view or Murphy\u2019s. The clumsy tool of legal\ncoercion is hardly likely to help remedy any wrongs here, not to\nmention the undesirability of official surveillance of intimate\nrelationships.\n\nThe privacy concerns defeat any prima facie right. A legal\nmoralist position must attend closely to what is known about the\npotential effects on privacy of the criminal law. Such a view would\nfind pertinent Lawrence Tribe\u2019s suggestion as to what the\nquestion should be in Bowers v Hardwick\u2014that is: not\nthe question of what Hardwick \u201cwas doing in the privacy of his\nbedroom, but what the State of Georgia was doing there\u201d (quoted\nin Suk 2009a:\n 689).[4]\n More recently Jeannie Suk has explored the relationship between the\ncriminal law and the value of privacy and intimate relationships.\nThough not writing from any self-declared legal moralist perspective\nthe ideas illustrate the kind of balanced exploration that the legal\nmoralist seeks. The criminal law in many\njurisdictions\u2014Suk\u2019s focus is largely on New York\nCounty\u2014showed, historically, a reluctance to enter the intimate\nspace of the home at the heavy cost of enabling domestic abuse against\nwomen. This has been replaced in many jurisdictions, such as New York\nCounty, by the criminalization in various guises of domestic abuse. An\nimprovement to be sure. However, Suk points to some complex resulting\ntensions \u201cbetween protecting women from intimate violence\u201d\nand respecting their \u201cself-determination\u201d (Suk 2009a:\n690). Certain criminal law techniques, such as protection orders that\nseek the end of an intimate relationship can amount, she claims, to\n\u201cstate-imposed de facto divorce\u201d (Suk 2009a: 685; 2009b)\nand to various contexts in which \u201cthe particular desires of\nindividual women\u201d do not \u201ccontrol\u201d a particular area\nof their intimate lives (Suk 2009a: 690). Suk\u2019s aim is not to\ndeny that the criminal law should be used to criminalize and enforce\nspecific laws against domestic abuse; the wrong (and harm) of domestic\nabuse remains a ground for such intervention. It is rather to focus on\nthe delicate balances implied by legal enforcement of such wrongdoing\nagainst the value of privacy, intimacy, and self-determination and to\nevaluate certain specific legal techniques in the light of such a\nfocus. It has led to numerous responses (see Suk 2009a, which contains\nreactions from eight commentators; on domestic abuse see also Friedman\n2003, Dempsey 2009).\n\nThis approach to privacy is not one accepted by all legal moralists.\nThe usual two-part structure of legal moralism\u2014the wrongs and\nthe countervailing factors\u2014was noted above. Devlin and Moore\ntreat privacy as a potentially defeating countervailing factor, an\naspect of the second part of that structure as we have just seen.\nDuff, however, treats it as a criterion to determine what counts as a\nwrong before even reaching the question of countervailing factors, in\nother words as an aspect of the first part of that structure. For\nDuff, the criminal law is, or should be, limited to the definition and\ndeclaration of public wrongs; wrongness, for him, \u201cis a\nreason for criminalization\u2014but only if it is committed within\nthe public realm\u201d (Duff 2018: 100). In insisting on this, Duff\nis departing from Devlin\u2019s claim:\n\n\nthat it is not possible to set theoretical limits to the power of the\nState to legislate against immorality. It is not possible to settle in\nadvance exceptions to the general rule or to define inflexibly areas\nof morality into which the law is in no circumstances to be allowed to\nenter. (Devlin 1965: 12\u201313)\n\n\nThe \u201cprivate realm\u201d for Duff\u2014which he aspires to\ndefine in advance, albeit not \u201cinflexibly\u201d\u2014is\nprecisely an area of morality into which the (criminal) law is not to\nbe allowed to enter.\n2.2 Liberty\n\nAs for liberty, \u201cthere must be\u201d, says Devlin,\n\u201ctoleration of the maximum individual freedom that is consistent\nwith the integrity of society\u201d (Devlin 1965: 16).\n\u201cToleration\u201d only arises in relation to conduct of which\none disapproves: toleration is not approval (Devlin 1965: 18; cf.\nOberdiek 2001; Green 2008). He gives two examples\u2014cruelty to\nanimals and \u2013the issue with which his view is most famously\nassociated\u2014homosexual sex and, as he puts it, the \u201cgeneral\nabhorrence of homosexuality\u201d in the UK in the late 1950s and\nearly 1960s (Devlin 1965: 17). As regards both, his question is: are\nthey beyond toleration by the criminal law? Devlin\u2019s answer is\nyes to the first and\u2014although there is a widespread erroneous\nview on this in the\n literature[5]\u2014no\n to the second. In other words, liberty or freedom of human choice\ncannot defeat the prima facie right of society to criminalize\ncruelty to animals on grounds of its wrongfulness, but, in the case of\nconsensual homosexual sex in private, it can (Devlin, Birmingham et\nal. 1965; cf. Devlin 1965: ix). On the latter issue, one might\ncertainly disagree (to put it mildly) with the claim that the\nreason gay sex ought not to be criminalized is that it is\nwithin the bounds of toleration, for that implies that such conduct is\nmorally wrongful in the first place. And one might also strongly doubt\nthe plausibility of Devlin\u2019s means of discerning where the\nboundary of maximum individual freedom lies\u2014turning both on how\nwidespread a moral belief is and on how intensely it\nis felt and\n believed.[6]\n We will return below to these points when we consider how\n\u201cmorality\u201d should be best understood in legal moralism\n (section 3).\n The point for now is to illustrate the structure of a legal moralism\nsuch as that of Devlin. In short Devlin took both animal cruelty and\nhomosexuality to be prima facie morally wrong, but took the\nformer all things considered to hold firm against liberty as a\npotential defeating condition, and the latter to be defeated by\nliberty (and other factors) when all things are considered. Moore in\nhis brand of legal moralism also stresses the place of liberty. In his\nview, \u201cthere is always some reason not to legally coerce\nbehaviour, namely, that to do so diminishes the opportunities of those\ncoerced, diminishes the likelihood of autonomously chosen rightful\nbehaviour etc.\u201d (Moore 1997: 749; 2014).\n\nThere is a controversy here as to whether the negative\nliberty which Moore explicitly invokes (and which Devlin assumes) can\nground the requisite prima facie reason against legal\ncoercion (for scepticism see Tadros 2016b: 79\u201382 and the\nresponse in Moore 2016:\n 352).[7]\n This raises the issue much explored in the philosophical literature\nof the extent to which liberty should be understood as \u201cnegative\nliberty\u201d or \u201cpositive liberty\u201d or some combination\nof the two (Carter 2019). Negative liberty, as Ian Carter puts it,\n\n\nis the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints. One has negative\nliberty to the extent that actions are available to one in this\nnegative sense. Positive liberty is the possibility of acting\u2014or\nthe fact of acting\u2014in such a way as to take control of\none\u2019s life and realize one\u2019s fundamental purposes. (Carter\n2019)\n\n\nAmy Baehr blocks out how the negative/positive liberty distinction\ntakes shape in liberal feminist writing, labelling approaches of the\nformer kind \u201cclassical-liberal feminism\u201d, and approaches\nof the latter kind as \u201cegalitarian-liberal feminism\u201d\n(Baehr 2021). As we saw in the previous subsection in relation to\nprivacy, it is a sign of the potential flexibility of a broad legal\nmoralist approach, that liberal-feminist accounts of freedom could\npotentially be deployed so as to yield potential defeating conditions\nfor all-things-considered determinations in given cases of whether\nlegal coercion can legitimately be deployed to counter an identified\nwrong. We touch on this issue again below\n (section 6.2).\n2.3 The Crime Tariff\n\nThe legal moralist notion of defeaters\u2014the conditions that can\npotentially defeat a prima facie reason to impose legal\ncoercion on the basis of moral wrongdoing\u2014should not be thought\nof as closed, but rather as flexible and subject to evolution or\nchange. The notion fits comfortably with an established set of\nconsiderations that have been developed since the 1960s, based on the\n\u201ccrime tariff\u201d and other mechanisms at work in the\ncriminal law (Packer 1964, 1968; Moore 1997: 664). The idea of the\ncrime tariff is that certain kinds of (perceived) wrongful behaviour\nwill be engaged in, one way or another, whether it is criminal or not.\nThat, of course, is not a conclusive objection to criminalization. If\nit were, the criminalization of murder or theft would be ruled out.\nHowever, if one looks at the predictable effects of criminalization of\ngiven wrongful conduct, it may make matters still worse than staying\nthe hand of the criminal law. For one effect of criminalization is\nthat the price of products (for example dangerous drugs) or services\n(for example sex work) will go up and will attract suppliers willing\nto break the law systematically and introduce a plethora of criminal\ngangs into societies, among other effects. The result may be worse\nthan leaving well (or quite bad) alone. Michael Moore, for example,\nwrites:\n\n\nProstitution\u2026 does not go away by being legislated against, as\nthe experience of all societies has shown. By making it criminal,\nhowever, the supply is artificially restricted to those willing to\nengage in criminal behaviour, so that prices and profits are such as\nto draw in organized criminal activity. (Moore 1997: 664; cf. Flanigan\n& Watson 2020).\n\n\nDevlin appeared to be anticipating this argument when pointing out a\nfactor that needed to be weighed in considering whether abortion\n(which he appeared to assume was morally wrongful) should be, or\nshould remain, criminal. Abortions, in certain circumstances, will be\nsought irrespective of whether the conduct is criminal. But, if\ncriminal, they will be performed by amateur, unskilled\n\u201cbackstreet\u201d practitioners, operating outside of legal\nregulation. This renders the procedure dangerous in a way it would not\nbe if properly attested professionals were undertaking the procedure;\nand punishment may seem appropriate for anyone causing or risking such\ndanger. However, the dangerousness of this conduct, said Devlin, is\n\u201clargely\u201d based on the facts that \u201cit is illegal and\ntherefore performed only by the unskilled\u201d (Devlin 1965: 24).\nThis again yields a factor of potential relevance\u2014even to those\nwho, like Devlin, believe abortion to be morally wrong. Whatever the\nconclusion, such a consideration is a factor to be weighed in the\nbalance.\n2.4 Self-Defeat and Other Forms of Defeat\n\nThere has been much research in the intervening decades on how\nnorm-subjects will respond to any potential use of the criminal law.\nWill they endorse it, ignore it, seek to undermine it? All of this can\nmake a difference to the wisdom of criminalizing in the first place.\nTom Tyler has argued that to a large extent obedience to the law is\nbased on what is perceived by people to be legitimate and to be\nrespected. The extent to which people obey because threatened by legal\nsanctions is, by contrast, exaggerated (Tyler 2006). Paul Robinson\nstresses the need for laws to be made that do not stray too far from\nthe norms already accepted by the people. For if they do, the people\nwill not stigmatize the conduct, which may blunt or compromise the\neffectiveness of the norms in question (Robinson 2000). Similarly,\nlegal officials may find various ways of underenforcing norms if they\nstray too far from those generally accepted, again blunting their\nefficacy. Bill Stuntz points to the phenomenon of\n\u201cself-defeating crimes\u201d (Stuntz 2000). A series of factors\nof the sort have most recently been examined by Jacob Barrett and\nGerald Gaus (Barrett & Gaus 2020). The idea of potential defeating\nconditions is a highly flexible one, not a once-for-all set of\nconditions with any rigidity; the list will inevitably change and\ndevelop. A further issue of potential relevance to the question of\nwhat conduct should be criminalized (and how) focusses on the\nconsequences of applying the criminal law in given areas. There is,\nfor example, a differential impact of the criminal law on some races\nin many jurisdictions (Yankah 2019). One might add to a list of\npotential defeaters the problem that enforcement of a given proposed\nor current offence is not possible under current conditions in any\ntolerably fair way. In the United Kingdom, for example, the politician\nDavid Lammy has written a report on racial disparities across the\ncriminal justice system and proposed a principle for government of\n\u201cexplain or reform\u201d: if governments cannot provide an\nevidence-based explanation for apparent disparities, then reforms\nshould be introduced to address them (Lammy 2017).\n\nThe above discussion emphasized the legal moralist\u2019s defeating\nfactors because of their importance to the position and because, as we\nhave seen, legal moralism is sometimes misleadingly characterized\nwithout reference to them. It was also noted that Feinberg holds such\nfactors to be of crucial importance to the version of the harm\nprinciple he endorses. Such factors will surely be largely ecumenical\nas between the rival approaches.\n3. The Morality of Legal Moralism\n\nAs we have seen, Devlin took homosexuality and animal cruelty to be\nmorally wrongful and therefore his reason for supporting the\ndecriminalization of the first and the continued criminalization of\nthe second was that they, respectively, ought to be tolerated and\nought not to be tolerated (see footnote 5). Notably neither Devlin nor\nHart addressed the question of why\u2014in virtue of what\u2014can\nit be asserted or denied that homosexuality is morally wrongful. For\nDevlin that is hardly to the point, for \u201cwhat the law maker has\nto ascertain is not the true belief but the common\nbelief\u201d(Devlin 1965: 94). By contrast Devlin\u2019s fellow\nlegal moralist, Moore, would take Devlin\u2019s support for\ndecriminalization of homosexual sex to be the right result for the\nwrong reason; homosexuality, not being in any way morally\nwrong, should not be criminalized for that straightforward reason; the\nquestion of toleration should never arise (Moore 1997: 756; Corvino\n2013; Pickett 2020).\n\nDevlin\u2019s account is a moral relativist one. He relativizes what\nis morally good to the beliefs of a given society (where \u201cdeeply\nfelt and not manufactured\u201d; Devlin 1965: 17). The attraction for\nDevlin of moral relativism was his belief that it would yield a\nmorality generally of the society subject to it, without\nconceding \u201cmoral expertise\u201d to any (elite) group of\npersons. He seemed to assimilate the \u201crationalist\nmorality\u201d he rejected to the views of an educated elite (Devlin\n1965:\n 91\u201392).[8]\n Since Hart\u2019s critique, few have found the relativist aspect of\nDevlin\u2019s account convincing (Hart 1963 [1982: 17\u201324]).\nDevlin\u2019s view appears to exemplify what Bernard Williams styled\nas \u201cvulgar and unregenerate\u201d relativism (B. Williams 1972:\n34, cf. Fricker 2013). Such relativism\u2014as Williams paints\nit\u2014is composed of three propositions:\n\n\n1.\n\u201cright\u201d means \u2026 \u201cright for a given\nsociety\u201d [also presumably by the same token: \u201cwrong\u201d\nmeans \u201cwrong for a given society\u201d];\n2.\nright[/wrong] \u201cfor a given society\u201d is to be\nunderstood in the functionalist sense\u2019 [i.e., for the\npersistence of that society]; and that\n3.\n(therefore) it is wrong for people in one society to condemn,\ninterfere with, etc., the values of another society.\n\u00a0\n(B. Williams 1972: 34\u201339, numbering added; cf. the\ndistinction between \u201cpositive morality\u201d and\n\u201ccritical morality\u201d in Hart 1963 [1982: 17\u201324])\n\n\n\nAs noted above, Devlin affirmed the first of William\u2019s\npropositions. In industrialized societies, Devlin tells us, it is\ngenerally true that monogamy \u201cis built into the house in which\nwe live and could not be removed without bringing it down\u201d\n(Devlin 1965: 10). But this is merely a contingent truth and if our\nhouses were built differently\u2014around polygamy\u2014the content\nof the law to be enforced could legitimately be the opposite of what\nit is (Devlin 1965: 114). As for the second, it is equally clear that\nDevlin understood wrongness \u201cfor a given society\u201d in\n\u201cthe functional sense\u201d of what threatened the persistence\nof that society. A society is constituted by its \u201ccommon\nmorality\u201d or \u201cmoral structure\u201d or \u201cpublic\nmorality\u201d and its morality is as necessary to it as \u201ca\nrecognised government\u201d, If a society\u2019s morality is not\nsufficiently enforced the society will \u201cdisintegrate\u201d; and\nthe society accordingly has a right to defend itself against attacks\non that morality (Devlin 1965: 10).\n\nDevlin\u2019s \u201cdisintegration argument\u201d appears fatally\nwounded by Hart\u2019s initial criticism of it. As Hart puts it,\nDevlin moves\n\n\nfrom the acceptable proposition that some shared morality is\nessential to the existence of any society to the unacceptable\nproposition that a society is identical with its morality as that is\nat any given moment of its history, so that a change in its morality\nis tantamount to a destruction of society. (Hart 1963 [1982: 51])\n\n\nThe former claim is plausible if restricted to what Hobbes and Hume\ncharacterized as the moral minimum essential for social life:\n\n\nrules restraining the free use of violence and minimal forms of rules\nregarding honesty, promise-keeping, fair dealing, and property. (Hart\n1967 [1983: 258])\n\n\nIf these ceased to be enforced, it is likely that a different and more\ndangerous state-of-affairs would ensue; one might well say the\noriginal society had disintegrated. Hart can afford to concede this.\nSuch a Hobbesian-Humean minimum is accounted for by the harm principle\nDevlin rejects. Devlin\u2019s argument, however, needs the\ndisintegration thesis to apply more widely, potentially to every crime\nof a community, be that to homosexuality, animal cruelty, bigamy,\nincest etc (to \u201cevery jot and tittle\u201d as Hart puts it:\nHart 1967 [1983: 258]). These need to be protected on pain of the\ndisintegration of society. Since Devlin gives no empirical evidence\nlinking the destruction of past societies with the non-enforcement of\ntheir rules, this appears not to be an empirical\n claim.[9]\n But as a conceptual argument it is highly dubious. For as Hart\nsays\n\n\nTaken strictly, it would prevent us saying that the morality of a\ngiven society has changed, and would compel us instead to say that one\nsociety had disappeared and another one taken its place (Hart 1963\n[1982: 51\u201352])\n\n\nOnly a claim of this strength seems able to support Devlin\u2019s\nbelief that any deviation from a society\u2019s shared\nmorality is an existential threat to it.\n\nA different objection is this: to assimilate right and wrong with the\nquestion of a society\u2019s survival assumes that the survival of a\nspecific society is necessarily good. It may be true that if certain\nsteps are not taken, the society will disintegrate. Apartheid in South\nAfrica disintegrated. What if by a more sustained enforcement of its\ncentral racist elements it had managed to persist longer? Would this\ncontinued existence be underwritten by a moral right? Does anyone now\nowe the society the duty to restore the system or did such a duty lie\nfor a period after its disintegration? The suggestions are absurd. The\npoint of course is that some societies are so lacking in legitimacy\nthat it may be for the best that they disintegrate and are replaced.\nDevlin goes too far when he says \u201cWhat is important is not the\nquality of the creed but the strength of the belief in it\u201d\n(Devlin 1965: 114). While his concern was the use of legal coercion\nwithin a specific society rather than with criticism of other\nsocieties, Devlin also appeared to hold to the third of\nWilliams\u2019 propositions above in seeking to exclude standards\nexternal to the beliefs of the society. Legal moralism, then, surely\nneeds foundations other than those Devlin sought to provide.\n\nThis impression is buttressed by another concern about his account.\nFor what is the status and basis of liberty and\nprivacy, for example, in Devlin\u2019s account? As we have seen he\ntook them to be powerful enough to override certain immoralities in\ndetermining what should be criminalized. But what if the ordinary jury\nmember or person on the Clapham omnibus just does not care that much\nabout privacy or liberty? What if, say, they take the view that\nadultery should be criminalized never mind the very high cost to\nprivacy? Should privacy and liberty be simply downgraded as a result?\nThere is no indication that Devlin would accept such a conclusion or\neven that the possibility occurred to him. Similarly, Devlin took it\nthat the law should be \u201cperfectly impartial in matters of\nreligion\u201d and this seems in no way sensitive to whether or not\nthe ordinary member of society endorses such impartiality (Devlin\n1965: 62). He appears to take liberty and privacy and other defeaters\nas safeguards applicable independently of whether ordinary people\nwould accept their validity. In this he appears to have been simply\ninconsistent.\n\nWhat alternative foundations could legal moralism have if\nDevlin\u2019s brand of moral relativism is to be rejected? In the\nlight of Devlin\u2019s stress on wrongdoing as a prima facie\nground for legal coercion, one possibility might be an ethics of\nprima facie duty associated with W.D Ross (Ross 1930; Skelton\n2012). And of course, any of the other numerous theories of what makes\nwrong action wrong\u2014consequentialist, Kantian, natural law,\nrights-based, virtue ethics\u2014could potentially form such a\nfoundation (Timmons\n 2013).[10]\n Michael Moore combines his legal moralism with a strong version of\nmetaphysical realism (Moore 1997). Presumably, however, such strong\nmetaethical commitments can be bracketed for the more specific\nquestions raised by legal moralism. Jeremy Waldron for example\nsuggests that an anti-realist or quasi-realist view, positing moral\ntruth, albeit based ultimately on subjective sources \u201cinside our\nown attitudes, desires, and natures\u201d, could serve as well as an\nout-and-out realist view of Moore\u2019s variety (Waldron 1999: 171).\nAgain, while a legal moralist must surely reject a\n\u201cvulgar\u201d relativist view of Devlin\u2019s stripe, it may\nnot follow that a more sophisticated moral relativist grounding for\nlegal moralism could not be attempted (Wong 2006; Rovane 2013;\nVelleman 2015; cf. Fricker 2013). Indeed Duff\u2019s legal moralism\nis alleged by others to contain moral relativist commitments, a claim\nhe himself rejects (Moore 2014: 199; Tadros 2016a: 121\u2013128; Duff\n2018: 232)\n4. The Harm Principle\n\nFar and away the best-known proposal for a principled limit to the law\nis the \u201charm principle\u201d from John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nOn Liberty. The pivotal sentence of its most famous passage\nreads:\n\n\nthe only purpose for which power can rightfully be exercised over any\nmember of a civilised community against his will is to prevent harm to\nothers. (Mill On Liberty, Ch. 1, para 9)\n\n\nHarm to others, can be contrasted with moral\nwrongfulness or immorality\u2014the legal moralist\u2019s\nstarting point; with offence to others; and with harm to\npersons choosing to engage in, or consenting to, the relevant\nconduct (anti-paternalism). At least as far as Mill\u2019s\ncanonical statement is concerned, moralism, offence and paternalism\nare ruled out as legitimate bases for legal coercion. The State may\nlegitimately stop A from beating up B, thereby limiting his freedom of\naction, because this prevents harm to B. And it may stop A from\nstealing from B for the same reason. But the State oversteps its\nproper limits on this view if it purports to stop A smashing up his\nown property; or to protect C from the distaste she will feel knowing\nthat A is doing this. And it may not treat the wrongfulness of\nconduct, in the absence of any unconsented-to harm, as a basis for\nlegal coercion: it may not for example prevent \u201cbloody\ngladiatorial contests presented by voluntary performers before\nconsenting audiences\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 13). For the harm\nprinciple, says Mill, is \u201centitled to govern absolutely the\ndealing of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and\ncontrol\u201d (Mill On Liberty, Ch. 1, para 9)\n\nIn his four-volume work, the Moral Limits of the Criminal Law\nJoel Feinberg sets out to defend a version of the harm principle that\nhe takes to be firmly in the spirit of Mill (Feinberg 1984, 1985,\n1986, 1990).\n\n\nThe Liberal Position: The harm and offense principles, duly\nclarified and qualified, between them exhaust the class of good\nreasons for criminal prohibitions.\n\n\nThis is compounded, first, of Feinberg\u2019s \u201charm to\nothers\u201d principle stating, as we saw in\n section 1:\n\n\nHarm to others: It is always a good reason in support of\npenal legislation that it would be effective in preventing\n(eliminating, reducing) harm to persons other than the actor (the one\nprohibited from acting) and that there is probably no other means that\nis equally effective at no greater cost to other values. (Feinberg\n1984: 26)\n\n\nBut Feinberg goes beyond Mill\u2019s officially stated position in\nadding, secondly, the offense principle:\n\n\nOffense to others: It is always a good reason in support of a\nproposed criminal prohibition that it is probably necessary to prevent\nserious offense to persons other than the actor and would probably be\nan effective means to that end if enacted. (Feinberg 1984: 26)\n\n\nThough this \u201coffense to others principle\u201d goes beyond\nMill\u2019s canonical position, Feinberg believed there to be support\nin Mill\u2019s writings for the addition of offense as a ground and\nin any case argued that there are independent grounds for thinking the\naddition of the offense principle strengthens the Millian position.\nThe place of offense and relatedly \u201cmoral distress\u201d\nremains controversial and has inspired an extensive literature\n(Feinberg 1985; Hart 1963 [1982: 46]; Waldron 1987 [1993]; Simester\n& von Hirsch 2011: 99\u2013140; Edwards 2019)\n\nThere is an important qualification to be made to Feinberg\u2019s\n\u201charm to others\u201d principle. One reason why one might want\nto treat harm as special is the yearning for a concept for practical\nuse that is \u201csimple, determinate\u201d and \u201cpurely\nempirical\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 214). Such a determinate empirical\nconcept, if it exists, could function free of the controversies that\nusually attend normative concepts. Everyone, from vastly diverse\ncultures, philosophies and opinions could get behind it, without fear\nof compromising what they hold dear. It is clear, however, that\nFeinberg abandons any hope, if this ever was a feasible ambition, of\nblocking out any such purely empirical notion. Instead he builds into\nhis harm principle a strong element of moral wrongfulness. As we have\nobserved, his harm principle is designed to reject moral\nwrongfulness as a legitimating ground for legal coercion, but the\ncrucial qualification here is that it rejects wrongfulness without\nmore as a legitimate basis for legal coercion. Moral wrongs,\nhowever, remain highly significant to the account. For harms\n\u201cproduced by justified or excused conduct (\u2018harms that are\nnot wrongs\u2019)\u201d are said by him not to count as\n\u201charms\u201d for the sake of his harm principle. It is thus not\nany harm to others that constitutes a good reason in support\nof legal coercion. It is the harms that are produced by \u201cmorally\nindefensible conduct\u201d that matter (Feinberg 1984: 215). In other\nwords, the proponent of Feinberg\u2019s harm principle must be highly\nconcerned with moral wrongs and immorality, perhaps almost as\nconcerned as the legal moralist.\n\nOn the one hand, this allows Feinberg to deal satisfyingly with a raft\nof potential counterexamples. Since, for him, a good reason for\ncoercion will present itself only if the harm in question is wrongful,\nhe can avoid designating as harmful setbacks to persons of the order\nof losing a professional tennis competition or of being driven out of\nbusiness by a rival\u2019s superior product, even if the consequences\nfeel like, and are, terrible events in the lives of the individuals\nconcerned. Be they so terrible they are not harms in the relevant\nsense for Feinberg, as they do not spring from any wrongdoing. On the\nother hand, the necessity of a moral wrong in his account of harms\nopens him up to potential criticism. For example, it might be claimed\nthat it is the wrongs that are doing the essential explanatory work,\nwhile harm is a redundant or near-redundant addition. Or the strong\nmoral wrongness element in the account might be taken as a tacit\nadmission that the reason the relevant harms matter in the first place\nis that they are morally wrongful; and if that point goes through, the\nnext question may be: why, then do wrongs that are not harms not\nalso matter enough to form, on occasion (and subject to\npotential defeating conditions), a valid reason for legal\ncoercion?\n\nFeinberg, however, is clearly Millian in his rejection of\npaternalism.\n\n\nPaternalism: It is always a good reason in support of a\nprohibition that it is probably necessary to prevent harm (physical,\npsychological, or economic) to the actor himself and that there is\nprobably no other means that is equally effective at no greater cost\nto other values. (Feinberg 1984: 26\u201327; Feinberg 1986)\n\n\nHis strong anti-paternalism is not equally hostile to everything that\nmight be described as legal paternalism. He distinguishes \u201csoft\npaternalism\u201d from \u201chard paternalism\u201d. In many cases\nthe forcible implementation of a person\u2019s will can accord with\nhis personal autonomy. Feinberg describes such cases as involving\n\u201csoft paternalism\u201d and contrasts them with those involving\n\u201chard paternalism\u201d (Feinberg 1986: 26). It is the\n\u201chard\u201d variety that Feinberg sets himself against, the\nforcible coercion of a person against her will for her own good. This\nhe rules out on grounds of legitimacy. In fact, he does not believe\nthat \u201csoft\u201d paternalism is really paternalism at all\nproperly so-called and so stops short of adding it to his list of\npotentially legitimating reasons for legal coercion (G. Dworkin\n2020).\n\nWhether or not Feinberg broke significantly with Mill on the question\nof offense, a much larger break with Mill is evident in the respective\ndefences of the harm principle offered by H.L.A Hart and Joseph Raz.\nSpeaking of Hart, Devlin observed that he \u201cmutinied\u201d\nagainst Mill and \u201cran paternalism up the mast\u201d (Devlin\n1965: 132). Hart indeed accuses Mill of carrying \u201chis protests\nagainst paternalism to lengths that may now appear to us\nfantastic\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982: 32]). Furthermore, anticipating\nparts of the \u201cNudge\u201d movement that emerged fully this\ncentury (Sunstein 2014), Hart speaks of\n\n\na general decline in the belief that individuals know their own\ninterests best, and to an increased awareness that a great range of\nfactors which diminish the significance to be attached to an\napparently free choice or consent. (Hart 1963 [1982: 32\u201333])\n\n\nRaz in turn speaks of his \u201cready embrace of various\npaternalistic measures\u201d, asserting it is \u201csenseless to\nformulate either a general pro- or a general anti-paternalistic\nconclusion\u201d (Raz 1986: 422: Simester & von Hirsch 2011: Part\nIV; Stanton-Ife 2020: 211\u2013220). The issue of paternalism is of\nconsiderable importance to the limits of the law, but for a deeper\ndiscussion beyond the brief remarks just made see the entry on\n paternalism\n (G. Dworkin 2020; cf. Hurd 2018; De Marneffe 2018; Conly 2018).\n\nHence Hart and Raz defend a \u201charm principle\u201d, not a\n\u201charm to others\u201d principle. Both nevertheless\nargue that it will often be the case that the state should not act\npaternalistically, only not in such a way that an exclusionary\nprinciple is merited. The dramatic differences between major\nproponents of the harm principle makes it misleading to speak of\nthe harm principle as one principle, although one suspects\nthe term is too far embedded in the debate to be dislodged. Therefore\nwe continue to speak of the harm principle, though strictly speaking,\nthere is more than one. The table below illustrates the divergence in\nthe views of the leading thinkers associated with the harm principle.\nNo one of them has an account with conclusions identical to any of the\nothers (see also Edwards 2014). What unites them all is the rejection\nof legal moralism.\n\n\nA family of harm-principle accounts:\n\npotentially legitimating grounds for legal coercion\n\n\nLegitimate basis for coercion?\nHarm to Others?\nOffence to Others?\nHarm to Self?\nLegal Moralism?  \n\n\nMill\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo \n\nFeinberg\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo \n\nHart\nYes\nYes, can be\nYes, can be\nNo \n\nRaz\nYes\nNo[11]\nYes, can be\nNo  \n\n\n5. What is Harm?\n\nProponents of the harm principle often proceed without supplying any\ndefinition or understanding of \u201charm\u201d. Mill himself gives\nno explicit general definition of what he means by the word,\nsatisfying himself with various examples, contextual stipulations and\nhints:\n\n\nhe seems throughout to think no further explanation is necessary, and\nto count on any literate speaker of English to accept his application\nof the word or of some proxy for it. (Brown 2017: 411)\n\n\nAs we will see, other writers consider they can detect in Mill one or\nmore ways to define or understand the term. Perhaps, as well as\nrelying on general linguistic intuitions, one can simply cite paradigm\ncases. These come easily to mind; harm as \u201cbroken bones and\nstolen purses\u201d as Joel Feinberg puts it (Feinberg 1984: 214).\nCertainly, one harms others, on any folk understanding of the term, by\nkilling, raping, beating, defrauding, or stealing. But the ordinary\nsense of harm may also suggest that a transitory pain is a harm and\nmay also have rather porous borders with other normative concepts such\nas \u201cwrong\u201d, May there, then, be trouble ahead developing a\nsufficiently determinate, discriminating, and workable conception of\nharm for purposes of applying the harm principle?\n5.1 Other-Regarding Conduct\n\nVarious definitions and understandings of \u201charm\u201d have been\noffered. One derived from Mill takes harmful conduct to be\n\u201cother-concerning\u201d or \u201cother-regarding\nconduct\u201d and, conversely, harmless conduct is\n\u201cself-regarding\u201d (Mill On Liberty, ch. 1, para\n9). Accordingly, if some actions have no social consequences, they\naffect only the actor and are therefore harmless. Hart seems\ndiscomforted enough by \u201ccritics\u201d of this Millian\nsuggestion to have been unwilling to adopt it himself across the\nboard. He surely had James Fitzjames Stephen\u2019s critique of Mill\nin mind among others (Stephen 1873 [1993]). These critics, he\nsays,\n\n\nhave urged that the line which Mill attempts to draw between actions\nwith which the law may interfere and those with which it may not is\nillusory. \u201cNo man is an island\u201d; and in an organised\nsociety it is impossible to identify classes of actions which harm no\none or no one but the individual who does them. (Hart 1963 [1982:\n5])\n\n\nDespite seeming to take Stephen\u2019s point against Mill, however,\nHart goes on to adopt the other-regarding/self-regarding understanding\nin a limited context: so far, he says, as the \u201cspecial topic of\nsexual morality\u201d is concerned there may exist a realm or area of\nconduct that is harmless; here it does seem, \u201cprima facie\nplausible that there are actions immoral by accepted standards and yet\nnot harmful to others\u201d (Hart 1963 [1982: 5]). It is not,\nhowever, clear how this understanding of harm is to be reconciled with\nHart\u2019s other uses of the term. For example, he discusses\n(sceptically) whether the \u201cmoral distress\u201d of persons\noccasioned by the moral wrongdoing of others should count as harm to\nthem (Hart 1963 [1982: 46]); cf. Waldron 1987 [1993]); and he asserts\nthat animal cruelty should be criminal, not pace Devlin to\n\u201cenforce a moral principle\u201d, but on account of animal\nsuffering. If there is a coherent way of bringing these various\nunderstandings of harm together, Hart does not himself supply it.\n5.2 A Setback to Interests\n\nAnother understanding of \u201charm\u201d again takes its cue from\nMill, this time from his many references to the\n\u201cinterests\u201d of persons\u2014for example: \u201cinsofar\nas these concern the interests of no person but himself\u201d and\n\u201csuch actions as are prejudicial to the interests of\nothers\u201d (Mill On Liberty, ch. 5, para 2). The important\ndistinction is not that which regards others versus that\nwhich regards oneself. It is that which is in the interests\nof others versus that which is in the interests of oneself. The\nseminal essay for this reading is from 1960 by John Rees (Rees 1960;\ncf. Saunders 2016), though Hart appears not to have been aware of it.\nRees paved the way for Feinberg\u2019s development of harm as\n\u201cthe setback of interests\u201d. Hence, in addition to\nFeinberg\u2019s addition of wrongfulness commented on above,\nFeinberg\u2019s defines harm as \u201cthose states of set-back\ninterest that are the consequence of wrongful acts or omissions by\nothers\u201d (Feinberg 1984: 215).\n\nThis Mill-inspired move of Rees and Feinberg, of defining harm in\nterms of interests, smacks of defining one unclear concept in terms of\nanother unclear concept (Miller 2010: 119). The question of what is in\na person\u2019s interests\u2014what is at stake for her\u2014is\nitself a question that requires considerable elucidation. In Derek\nParfit\u2019s terms should we understand \u201cinterests\u201d in\n\u201cdesire-fulfilment\u201d terms, in \u201chedonistic\u201d\nterms, or in accordance with an \u201cobjective list\u201d which\nholds\n\n\ncertain things are good or bad for people, whether or not the people\nwould want to have the good things, or to avoid the bad things?\n(Parfit 1984: 499)\n\n\nMight one reasonably think that adjudicating the conflict between\nhedonistic, desire-fulfilment and objective list understandings of\ninterests is an undertaking no less complex than the harm\nprinciple/legal moralism conflict itself? Take an \u201cobjective\nlist\u201d understanding of a person\u2019s interests. According to\nParfit this might include\u2014as good for a\nperson\u2014\u201cmoral goodness, rational activity, the development\nof one\u2019s abilities\u201d and so on; and it might\ninclude\u2014as bad for a person\u2014being \u201cdeprived of\ndignity\u201d (Parfit 1984: 499). If this is always or sometimes the\nbest account of interests, the whole question of \u201cmoral\nharm\u201d that the harm principle aims to expel is potentially\nreintroduced. The question of which account, or combination of\naccounts, is the most compelling is very much a live issue (Fletcher\n2016).\n5.3 A Setback to Autonomy/Prospect Harm\n\nAnother influential understanding of \u201charm\u201d is that\ninitially proposed by Raz: \u201cTo harm a person is to diminish his\nprospects, to affect adversely his possibilities\u201d (Raz 1986:\n414; Gardner & Shute 2000; Simester & von Hirsch 2011; Edwards\n2014, 2019). Harm is essentially understood not as a setback to\ninterests, but a setback to autonomy. Autonomy is essentially\nunderstood as the ability to choose between an adequate range of\nvaluable options, while in possession of the appropriate capacities to\nmake such choices and while sufficiently independent of others. There\nare plainly numerous ways one can set back such autonomy. The problem\nof explaining why pain is harmful raises its head again. Many would\ntake the infliction of pain on another to be harmful, without waiting\nto ask if the victim has suffered any setback in her ability to choose\nbetween an adequate range of valuable options, which surely, she will\noften not have done. And what of Devlin\u2019s case of harm to\nanimals? Devlin is likely to pop up at this point to repeat his view\nthat the reason we criminalize cruelty to animals is that it is\nmorally wrong and no potential defeating factor is strong enough to\noverturn that judgement for purposes of criminalization. There is no\nneed to establish any harm in the first place. Hart, as touched on\nabove, while accepting harm must be part of the story, offered the\navoidance of \u201csuffering\u201d as the ground for criminalizing\nanimal cruelty. Setback to autonomy or prospect-harm, however, looks\nlike a non-starter, for animals, though beings that can be harmed, are\nnot autonomous beings, at least on any standard account. Similarly,\nseverely mentally disordered persons may in some cases lack the\ncapacity for autonomy, but it is plain as day that they can be harmed,\nsomething the \u201csetback to autonomy\u201d or \u201cprospect\nharm\u201d conception seems ill equipped to account for (Stanton-Ife\n2010: 157\u2013162; Tadros 2011).\n\nOne upshot of the varying, sometimes implicit, understanding of harm\nis surely that anyone propounding an argument based on the harm\nprinciple needs to be clear about how they are using the term\n\u201charm\u201d. For the term may hide a host of questions that\nthemselves need to be resolved.\n6. Foundations of the Harm Principle\n6.1 Utilitarian/Consequentialist Foundations\n\nMoving on from questions of definition, what are the foundations of\nthe harm principle? Mill, together with Jeremy Bentham and Henry\nSidgwick, was one of three giants of nineteenth century\nutilitarianism. He declared utility to be the ultimate appeal on all\nethical questions. Speaking of his harm principle, he also\ndeclared:\n\n\nI forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the\nidea of abstract right, as a thing independent from utility. (Mill\nOn Liberty, ch. 1.11 [1993: 79])\n\n\nThe harm principle sounds rather like the (foregone) stuff of abstract\nright, so how is utility to give any support to the harm principle? At\nfirst sight, the principle of utility looks like a straightforward\nrival to the harm principle, not its sturdy foundation. Mill\nheld of the principle of utility that\n\n\nactions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness,\nwrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. (Mill\nUtilitarianism, ch. 2.2 [1993: 7]\n\n\nThis last formulation seems to counsel states to keep their options\nopen in their law-making. \u201cDo what you can to reverse\nunhappiness\u201d, the advice seems to be, \u201cand do what you can\nto promote happiness\u201d,\n\n\nCoerce to prevent harm to others if that will reverse unhappiness;\ncoerce for some other end if that will equally do the trick.\n\n\nBut as we have just seen, coercion to prevent harmless wrongdoing is\nruled out by Mill, irrespective of whether such an action is the\nstate\u2019s best bet for reversing unhappiness.\n\nThe path to reconciling the harm principle with utilitarianism is\noften thought to be some form of indirect utilitarianism\n(Gray 1996; Mulgan 2007: 117\u2013119). The distinction is drawn\nbetween a criterion of rightness and a decision\nprocedure (Mulgan 2007: 117\u2013119). Thus, on this indirect\nview the words \u201cactions are right in proportion as they tend to\npromote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of\nhappiness\u201d is not any part of a decision procedure; it is a\ncriterion of rightness. Sometimes, perhaps often, a criterion of\nrightness will itself feature heavily in a decision procedure. But at\nother times a decision procedure will not contain the supreme\ncriterion of rightness. Acting always to promote happiness or minimize\nunhappiness may be self-defeating for various reasons or impossible in\nthe practical circumstances of ignorance that ordinary people face.\nOver the course of a lifetime and across all the activities of a legal\nsystem, more utility will be produced and disutility avoided if the\nharm principle has the place Mill argues it has, despite the fact that\nthis will repeatedly require the sacrifice of some utility in day to\nday legal dealings. Much of this, for Mill, relates to the importance\nof human liberty to happiness (Gray 1996: 136). Demonstrating that one\ncan really derive something as strong as the harm principle (\u201cto\ngovern absolutely\u201d) in this way is a formidable challenge. It is\nsubject, among other things, to scepticism about the workability of\nthe distinction between criterion of rightness and decision procedure\n(Griffin 1994; Mulgan 2007). John Gray\u2019s book-long attempt to\nspell out how the harm principle can be underpinned by indirect\nutilitarianism came to be repudiated by Gray himself (Gray 1996:\npostscript) . Contemporary consequentialism, however, continues to\nflourish (Sinnott-Armstrong 2019); and many accounts of the harm\nprinciple still see a form of utilitarianism as the best grounding for\nthe harm principle (Sumner 2004, 2011). Moreover, there are\nnon-utilitarian writers making related arguments in support of the\nharm principle. Les Green for example argues that\n\n\nThere can be reasons to promulgate, and attempt to conform to, an\nabsolute norm even if the reasons that justify having a norm in that\nfield are defeasible. (Green 2013: 191)\n\n\nOther accounts of criminalization maintain utilitarianism or a broad\nconsequentialism but conclude the harm principle must be rejected\n(Petersen 2020a,b).\n6.2 Perfectionist/Value-Pluralist Foundations\n\nIn recent years, value-pluralist perfectionism has been more\ninfluential than utilitarianism as a foundation for the harm\nprinciple, whether argued for explicitly or assumed (Raz 1986; Gardner\n& Shute 2000; Simester & Von Hirsch 2011; Edwards 2014, 2018\n[2021]). Joseph Raz\u2019s classic work The Morality of\nFreedom contains a defence of the harm principle (Raz 1986; cf.\nRaz 1989\u2014other leading accounts of perfectionism include Hurka\n1993 and Sher 1997). Raz claims that\n\n\nthe autonomy-based principle of freedom is best regarded as providing\nthe moral foundation for the harm principle. (Raz 1986: 400)\n\n\nAt first sight this may be surprising, given the openness of\nperfectionists to moral reasons in general, an openness that might\nsuggest legal moralism is its natural home so far as the limits of law\nare concerned. Raz asserts that there is \u201cno fundamental\nprincipled inhibition on governments acting for any moral\nreason\u201d (Raz 1989: 1230, emphasis added). Even reasons that are\nnot \u201cneutral\u201d, or not \u201cpublic\u201d or some such\nare not in principle excluded by perfectionism (cf. G. Dworkin 2007).\nAgain: \u201cIt makes no sense to say of a state of affairs that it\nis good, but that fact is no reason to do anything about it\u201d\n(Raz 1989: 1230). By the same token, presumably, one could substitute\nthe word \u201cbad\u201d for \u201cgood\u201d in the previous\nsentence and the proposition would remain accurate. Thus our starting\npoint is that the law should have available to it any moral reason and\nhas the function to promote the quality of life, including the moral\nquality of life, of those whose lives and actions the government can\naffect (Raz 1986: 415). This aspect of perfectionism is apt to make\nsome fear the oppressive imposition of styles of life on unwilling\nindividuals (Sher 1997: 106).\n\nHowever, such alarmism cannot fairly be applied to a perfectionist\nview such as Raz\u2019s. It is not that anything one might\ndescribe, rightly or wrongly, as a moral reason will do. Raz\u2019s\nconcern is limited to states with \u201cautonomy-respecting\ncultures\u201d and with what it is to live a good life in such\nsocieties. The key, as the phrase \u201cautonomy-respecting\nculture\u201d would suggest, is autonomy. It is a state\u2019s\nprimary duty in the relevant kind of society to promote, protect and\nfoster the autonomy of all citizens. This requires\u2014on\nRaz\u2019s account\u2014furnishing all with, or preserving for all,\nan \u201cadequate range of valuable options\u201d. It also requires\nseeing to it that persons have the appropriate mental and other\ncapacities to be genuine choosers in conditions of freedom and\nindependence (Raz 1986: 372\u2013373).\n\nGiven, then, that Raz\u2019s starting point is that there is no\nprincipled inhibition to the law deploying any valid moral reason, an\naccount is plainly needed of how that can be reconciled with his\nsupport for the harm principle, a large part of the point of which is\nto rule out certain moral reasons. But before coming to that, it will\nbe helpful to dwell on autonomy a little longer. In\n section 2.2\n above, the familiar distinction between two kinds of liberty,\nnegative and positive, and a similar distinction within liberal\nfeminist writing, were noted. Autonomy-based accounts plainly go\nbeyond negative liberty as the absence of obstacles, barriers or\nconstraints, and embrace the notions of positive liberty, in terms of\nauthorship (or part-authorship) of one\u2019s own life, ability to\nchoose between options, realize purposes within bounds as the case may\nbe. Furthermore, autonomy is often contrasted with heteronomy. As\nMarilyn Friedman puts it,\n\n\nheteronomy\u2026involves behaving or living in accord with what is\nin some important sense not, or other than,\none\u2019s own. (Friedman 2005: 155, author\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nThere are at least two senses, as she continues, of heteronomy, one\nwhose sources \u201carise within the self, considered in abstract\nsocial isolation;\u201d the other whose sources \u201cderive from\ninterpersonal relations and the treatment of a self by others\u201d\n(Friedman 2005: 155). The first sense is of course important. It\nrelates, for one thing, to the very real problems that can emerge when\nan agent\u2019s \u201cdesires, emotions, passions, inclinations,\ndrives\u201d are not in good order, or where the agent is addicted or\nin the grip or a compulsion (Friedman 2005: 155). However, for all its\nimportance, Friedman argues that heteronomy in this sense has been the\n\u201calmost exclusive\u201d focus in mainstream philosophy. The\nsorts of heteronomy that are by contrast based on interpersonal\nrelations and the way some agents are treated by others, has been\nlargely neglected outside of liberal feminist circles, where\n\u201crelational autonomy\u201d has received considerable attention\n(Friedman 2005: 171; cf. Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000; Friedman 2003;\nStoljar 2018). This has led to the underplaying of such phenomena of\nconsiderable importance to autonomy as male dominance. Interestingly,\nFriedman explicitly cites Raz\u2019s account of autonomy as a rare\nexception to the neglect by the mainstream of the social or\ninterpersonal aspects of autonomy ((Friedman 2005: 171).\n\nThus the criticism sometimes levelled at perfectionist accounts of the\ngood life, government or law, that they imply the oppressive\nimposition of styles of life, looks unlikely to get much traction on a\nform of liberal perfectionism, such as Raz\u2019s, with autonomy for\nall so embedded in it. This, however, does not explain how an account\nsuch as Raz\u2019s can explain its adoption of an anti-moralist harm\nprinciple in tandem with its in-principle openness to all valid moral\nreasons. In other words, how can one derive an anti-moralist harm\nprinciple from a position that takes any valid moral ground as in\nprinciple available to the state and the law?\n\nRaz\u2019s answer focusses on the coercive means at the\nlaw\u2019s disposal:\n\nThere are no principled limits to the pursuit of moral goals by\nthe law or the enhancement of the well-being of individuals on the\npart of the law.\nThere are (nevertheless) limits to the means that can\nlegitimately be adopted in promoting the well-being of people and in\nthe pursuit of moral ideals (Raz 1986: 420; George 1993:\n161\u2013188).\n\n\nHis autonomy principle \u201cpermits and even requires governments to\ncreate morally valuable opportunities, and to eliminate repugnant\nones\u201d (Raz 1986: 417). It must, however, respect the harm\nprinciple in doing this. It must not use coercion to\neliminate repugnant, wrongful opportunities if they are not also\nharmful in the relevant sense. Coercive interference is a special\nthreat to autonomy. It often violates autonomy in two ways:\n\n\nFirst it violates the condition of independence and expresses a\nrelation of domination and an attitude of disrespect for the coerced\nindividual. Second, coercion by criminal penalties is a global and\nindiscriminate invasion of autonomy. (Raz 1986: 418)\n\n\nLet us consider both points, beginning with the second. In what sense\nis the use of coercion a \u201cglobal and indiscriminate invasion of\nautonomy\u201d? There is no doubt that sometimes it is.\n\u201cDepriving a person of opportunities or of the ability to use\nthem is\u201d, as Raz says, \u201ca way of causing him harm\u201d.\nAgain \u201cfrustrating [a person\u2019s] pursuit of projects and\nrelationships he has set upon\u201d can cause harm (Raz 1986: 413).\nRaz alludes to the most common context for the invocation of the harm\nprinciple, namely the criminal law. Much behaviour that is\ncriminalized is done under the threat of imprisonment and imprisonment\ncan cut off a very large range of options; or it can reduce\nthem considerably by various forms of disruption or destruction: of\nfamily life, deep personal relations, work opportunities, pursuit of\nvaluable outdoor activities, political participation and so on.\nRichard Lippke distinguishes between the material and the symbolic\ndimensions of imprisonment. The symbolic dimensions relate to what\nmessage the fact of imprisonment conveys to the public and to the\nprisoner. The material dimensions break down into\n\nrestrictions on freedom of movement,\nlow levels of comfort and amenity\nidleness, especially a paucity of opportunities for labour,\nrelative isolation from family members, friends, and the larger\ncommunity,\nsignificant diminution of autonomy especially insofar as prisons\nsubject their inhabitants to a degree of bureaucratic control which\nmight be categorised as the \u201csubservience of youth\u201d\nand\ndiminishment of privacy (Lippke 2008: 408; cf. Lippke 2007).\n\n\nThough only one of Lippke\u2019s six material dimensions explicitly\nmentions autonomy, all have some significant effect on it. Moreover, a\nsimilar point applies to the compulsory detention in certain\ncircumstances of mentally disordered persons under the civil law. All\nof Lippke\u2019s material dimensions can be present there too; and,\nwhile the symbolic dimensions of a criminal conviction and punishment\nare absent, the often-attendant stigma can compromise the autonomy of\nthe detained mentally disordered person in question still further\n(Stanton-Ife 2012).\n\nRaz, then, is right that coercion by criminal penalties can be\n\u201ca global and indiscriminate invasion of autonomy\u201d,\nHowever, there seem to be two problems with this as a basis for\nreconciling perfectionism and the harm principle. First, the scope of\nthe justification seems significantly limited; while the criminal\npenalties can have such an effect, they often will not. For\nthere are many more forms of criminal law coercion in regular use than\nimprisonment: fines, community service orders and electronic tagging\norders are three examples. These methods short of imprisonment can\naffect options, without necessarily leaving the convicted criminal\nshort of an adequate range of valuable options\u2014in\nRaz\u2019s terminology; the assault on autonomy will not in most be\ntotal or near-total. Take the last-mentioned example: the mandatory\nwearing of electronic tagging devices. There have been several\nhigh-profile cases of sports stars and other celebrities being\nrequired to wear such devices. An early example is the English soccer\nplayer, Jermaine Pennant. He broke into the first team of a top\nprofessional team\u2014the stuff that most English lads\u2019 dreams\nare made of!\u2014but, soon after, was convicted of a drunk-driving\noffence. His sentence required him to wear an electronic tag but\nallowed him to play in top division games with his tag under his\n sock.[12]\n Despite the cloud he was under he certainly did not appear to have an\ninadequate range of valuable options. The argument at best seems to\nsupport the deployment of the harm principle only where lengthy\nperiods of incarceration are deployed or threatened.\n\nRaz does acknowledge that \u201cother forms of coercion may be less\nsevere\u201d. However, he adds that\n\n\nthey all invade autonomy, and they all, at least in this world, do it\nin a fairly indiscriminate way. That is, there is no practical way of\nensuring that the coercion will restrict the victims\u2019 choice of\nrepugnant options but will not interfere with their other choices.\n(Raz 1986: 418\u2013419)\n\n\nLeaving the criminal law to one side, there are other legal contexts\nwhere Raz intends the harm principle to apply where this argument\nappears overstated. Consider tax. Of the operation of the harm\nprinciple in relation to taxation, Raz writes:\n\n\nthe measures I [support] avoid direct coercion for perfectionist\ncauses. The coercion that they involve can be fully justified on the\ngrounds of protecting and promoting individual autonomy. The simplest\nexample is that of taxation. Taxation is coercive. It is justified in\nmy view only inasmuch as it is useful for the promotion and protection\nof autonomy for all. (Raz 1989: 1232)\n\n\nRaz takes taxation to be coercive (indirectly) and argues it should be\nraised only subject to the terms of the harm principle. But the\nderivation of a perfectionist harm principle here cannot be based on\nany \u201cglobal and indiscriminate\u201d invasion of autonomy,\nbecause tax\u2014except in extreme cases where imposed\noppressively\u2014does not attack autonomy that hard and, if\nsuitably progressive, should leave the person taxed with her abilities\nto choose between an adequate range of valuable options intact\n(Stanton-Ife 2017). Of course, taxation, conceived in this way, does\nnot imply what Raz elsewhere describes as \u201ca coercive imposition\nof a style of life\u201d (Raz 1986: 161). This seems to reveal that a\nmuch more nuanced account of coercion, in its various manifestations,\nis required, not that coercion \u201cin this world\u201d is always\n\u201cglobal and indiscriminate\u201d,\n\nThe second problem with Raz\u2019s (correct) observation that\ncoercion by criminal penalties can on occasion be \u201ca global and\nindiscriminate invasion of autonomy\u201d, is summarized in the\nquestion \u201cwhat follows when it is?\u201d What does\nfollow, surely, is that such coercion must shoulder a large burden of\njustification. What does not appear to follow is anything to do with\nwhat kind of valid moral reason\u2014be it harm-based or\nwrong-based\u2014should be doing the needed justificatory work. The\nperfectionist starting point, as we have seen, is that there are no\nprincipled limits to the pursuit of moral goals by the law. It is the\njob of the harm principle to provide them if the harm principle can be\nsuccessfully derived. Pointing to global and indiscriminate coercion\npoints us to something that requires justification, but not yet to\nwhat kind of justification is needed.\n\nAs noted above Raz has another argument for liberal\nperfectionism\u2019s right to claim the harm principle for its own:\nnamely coercion\n\n\nviolates the condition of independence and expresses a relation of\ndomination and an attitude of disrespect for the coerced individual.\n(Raz 1986: 418)\n\n\nMight this argument make up the slack? Gerald Dworkin counters that\ncoercing someone based on their wrongful or immoral behaviour need not\nshow disrespect for such a person, \u201cbut merely for his\nconduct\u201d (G. Dworkin 2007: 447). Alternatively, if it be\naccepted that coercion is disrespectful and expresses a\nrelation of domination, one might again ask why that is not true of\nsomeone one coerces out of harming others as much as it is true of\ncoercing someone out of some morally wrongful conduct? In both cases,\ndoes the legitimacy of the coercion not turn on the presence of\nsufficient justification, be that harm-based or wrong-based?\nFurthermore, if the key argument for the harm principle is really\nbased on respect for independence and opposition to domination, it may\nseem particularly puzzling to identify how it is really a\nharm-based argument at all. It is true that independence, is\nfor Raz, part and parcel of his understanding of autonomy (Raz 1986:\n377\u2013378); and it is also true that he understands harm in terms\nof setbacks to autonomy. However, if the argument turns on\nindependence alone, the question arises of whether it does not\ncollapse into\u2014or keep sufficient distance from\u2014certain\nprinciples devised in explicit opposition to the harm principle, such\nas Arthur Ripstein\u2019s \u201csovereignty principle\u201d?\nRipstein argues that conduct should not be legally coerced if it does\nnot wrongfully interfere with the sovereignty of others (Ripstein\n2006: 231; for critique, see Tadros 2011).\n\nRaz\u2019s \u201cone simple reason\u201d why \u201cthe harm\nprinciple is defensible in the light of the principle of\nautonomy\u201d, viz. that \u201cthe means used, coercive\ninterference, violates the autonomy of its victim\u201d (Raz 1986:\n418) runs into the difficulty that often coercion does not do that or\ndoes not do that very significantly, let alone globally and\nindiscriminately. Furthermore, where coercion does violate autonomy\nglobally and indiscriminately, it is either wrongful all things\nconsidered or justifiable only on the basis of strong valid reasons,\nwhich may include (exclusively) wrongness-based reasons for all that\nis as yet established. Finally, to the extent that the argument turns\non independence it is not clear that harm is really doing the\nwork.\n7. Public Reason\n\nAs we have seen, several leading legal writers\u2014be they in favour\nor against\u2014continue to take Mill\u2019s harm principle in\noriginal or modified form to be \u201cthe dominant theory as to what\nlimits on criminal legislation should be observed by liberal\ndemocratic states\u201d (Moore 2017: 461). Katrina Forrester\u2019s\npost-war history of liberal political thought, however, emphatically\nputs John Rawls, rather than Mill, at the centre (Forrester 2021); and\nPiers Norris Turner, in an essay on Mill and modern liberalism, opines\nthat public reason liberalism\u2014whose leading light is\nRawls\u2014has become the dominant tradition within liberal thought\n\u201cover the past three decades\u201d (Turner 2017: 576; cf.\nTurner and Gaus 2017; Rawls 1999; Quong 2018; Hartley & Watson\n2018; Freeman 2020). However, the growing and highly sophisticated\nliterature on public reason among specifically political philosophers\nhas not yet\u2014at least not to the extent that it has in relation\nto legal moralism and the harm principle\u2014received the sustained\nstudy of writers as heavily steeped in the law as Feinberg, Hart or\nDevlin. Specific legal applications of the public reason approach are,\nhowever, already in existence (for example Flanders 2016) and the\napproach continues to develop.\n\nThe approach suggests a different limit of the law: that laws must in\nsome sense be based on public reasons, not reasons harvested\nfrom, or based on, comprehensive moral, ethical or religious theories.\nWe saw above that while Devlin, Moore and Hart all supported the\ndecriminalization of gay sex, they did so on very different\nunderstandings. Devlin did not rule out circumstances, admittedly\nextreme ones, in which criminalization might be justifiable in virtue\nof the intensity and comprehensiveness of the beliefs of ordinary\npersons in a society. Moore and Hart, by contrast, did implicitly rule\nout criminalization in such circumstances. Moore because the moral\ntruth of the matter is highly pertinent, indeed\ndecisive\u2014there being nothing morally wrong with gay\nsex\u2014Hart, despite assuming the moral truth of the matter to be\nirrelevant\u2014gay sex is not harmful, so the conclusion\ngoes through whether such conduct is wrongful or not. Rawls for his\npart would no doubt agree with all three on the correctness of\ndecriminalization. But he would seek to exclude, as did Hart and\nDevlin, any Moore-style or perfectionist appeal to a comprehensive\nmoral understanding to determine the issue. Devlin for his part would\nhave had Moore down as one of the \u201cmoral rationalists\u201d\nwhose views he wanted side-lined in favour of the reasonable\ncitizen.\n\nIn one way, then, Devlin anticipates a major preoccupation of Rawls.\nRawls did not, to be sure, take Devlin\u2019s apparent view that the\nmoral beliefs of a society constitute (its) moral truth. His\nwas not a scepticism about the existence of moral truth, merely a\ndetermination to avoid \u201cthe zeal to embody the whole\ntruth in politics\u201d (Rawls 1999: 132\u2013133, emphasis added).\nBut both Devlin and Rawls demanded that political power and legal\ncoercion should be justifiable to those subject to them,\nprovided they are reasonable. Thomas Nagel similarly insists\na state\u2019s law must do better than just tell those with certain\nconceptions of the good that they are mistaken, which seems the\nimplication of Moore\u2019s and of the perfectionist view; something\nmore must be offered to them relating, he argues, to the point of view\nof such persons. According to him we must support:\n\n\n\u2026 the exclusion of certain values from the admissible grounds\nfor the application of coercive state powers. We must agree to refrain\nfrom limiting people\u2019s liberty by state action in the name of\nvalues that are deeply inadmissible in a certain way from their point\nof view. (Nagel 1991: 155)\n\n\nDevlin and Rawls, however, differed in how justification to reasonable\ncitizens should be spelt out and it is here that Rawls develops much\nof his account. Devlin\u2019s model of the reasonable person was the\njury. To the question how the lawmaker is to ascertain the moral\njudgements of society, Devlin answered,\n\n\nthe moral judgement of society must be something about which any\ntwelve men or women drawn at random might after discussion be expected\nto be unanimous. (Devlin 1965: 15).\n\n\nTo insist, as both do, that justification must be targeted at the\nreasonable citizen is to idealize the agreement on which their views\nwere based (Raz 1990 [1994]; Enoch 2013; Billingham & Taylor\nforthcoming), since neither is saying one should simply seek the\nacceptance of (all) the citizens as they are, reasonable or not.\nInsisting on the actual agreement of citizens as they actually are is\nlikely to prove excessively demanding, since too much of the rough\nmust be taken with the smooth, accommodating misanthropic,\nmisogynistic, egotistical, anarchic etc views. Devlin does not\nidealize a great deal, or at least he does not spell out in any detail\nhow he understands what \u201creasonable\u201d means, beyond\ninsisting the reasonable jury-member must not hold\n\u201cirrational\u201d beliefs, such as \u201chomosexuality is the\ncause of earthquakes\u201d (Devlin 1965: viii). In stating one can\nnotionally pick \u201ctwelve men or women at random\u201d he\nappeared to think that a sample of the population is an adequate\npointer to the appropriate morality. Here there is a stark contrast\nwith Rawls. For taking a random sample of the population is to\nunderemphasise moral disagreement, as Rawls would see it. It is not\nreasonable to think that moral disagreement will disappear in the\nmedium- or even the long-term. And much of this disagreement cannot\nsimply be blamed on the bloody-mindedness of some or on those biased\nin favour of themselves, their families, or groups. Some of the\ndisagreement is based, rather, on differences over what evidence is\nappropriate, how much weight should be given to the evidence where it\ncan be agreed upon, how priorities and choices should be made among\nthe vast range of possible values and so on. Rawls describes factors\nsuch as these as \u201cthe burdens of judgment\u201d (Rawls 1993:\n56\u201357). Hence Rawls idealizes the constituency to whom legal\ncoercion must be justified inter alia as the persons who\naccept the burdens of judgement and the resulting fact of reasonable\npluralism.\n\nThe idealization involved in the public reason approach is\ncontroversial. There is scepticism in some quarters that there really\nis any genuine \u201cmiddle way\u201d between \u201cactual\n(including implied) agreement and rational justification\u201d (Raz\n1990: 46). If too many constraints are built in, the very idea of\njustification-to a given constituency disappears. The leading\nnatural law theorist John Finnis, writes:\n\n\nNatural Law theory is nothing other than the account of all the\nreasons-for-action which people ought to be able to accept, precisely\nbecause these are good, valid and sound as reasons. (Finnis 1996:\n10\u201311).\n\n\nNatural law, theory, is a paradigm \u201ccomprehensive\u201d\ndoctrine, however, precisely what is to be avoided in Rawls\u2019\nview. If justification-to ends up meaning only giving good\nreasons to a certain constituency, the idea has all but\nevaporated.\n\nAnother contrast with Devlin\u2019s members of the jury, is that\nRawlsian public reason is not simply a matter of getting a sample of\nthe people into a notional room and waiting for them to agree, however\nthat is to be done. Public reason is itself a substantive framework to\nbe shared by everyone, a module, \u201ca complete political\nconception\u201d whose principles and ideals are to be elaborated and\nwhose arguments are to be deployed in legal argument (Rawls 1999:\n138). It has content, in other words, \u201cgiven by a family of\nreasonable conceptions of justice\u201d (Rawls 1999: 132). While, as\nwe have just noted, a natural law or Roman Catholic world view cannot\nitself be adopted under public reason, its conception of the common\ngood or solidarity when \u201cexpressed in terms of political\nvalues\u201d can be one grounding for a political conception that\ngives content to public reason (Rawls 1999: 142). For interesting\nexplorations of the relationship between religious comprehensive\ndoctrines and public reason, see, e.g., An-Na\u2019im 2015,\nBillingham 2021.\n\nTwo kinds of issue of special concern to questions of the limits of\nlaw concern, first, the scope of public reason and, secondly, its\ncapacity to account convincingly for certain apparently easy cases of\nlegitimate legal coercion. As for the first, Rawls restricts public\nreason to \u201cconstitutional essentials and matters of basic\njustice\u201d (Rawls 1999: 133). Is it convincing to thus limit\npublic reason? In the eyes of some Rawls is too permissive about\nimportant matters of (non-basic) justice and fairness beyond the\nconstitutional essentials and the basic aspects of justice. Jonathan\nQuong for example objects to Rawls\u2019 openness to perfectionist\nvalues so far as \u201clarge resources to grand projects in the arts\nand sciences\u201d are concerned (Quong 2011: 281; Stanton-Ife\n2020).\n\nSecondly, how well does the public reason view handle certain\nobviously legitimate uses of legal coercion, such as the\ncriminalization of murder and rape? While there is no doubt that a\nRawlsian public reason module, duly developed, would straightforwardly\ndeliver the bare bones of coercive laws against murder and rape, can\nthis be done fully and satisfactorily without the sort of recourse to\ncomprehensive moral and metaphysical doctrines Rawls wishes to rule\nout? Take murder as an example. Standardly murder requires proof of at\nleast causation of death with an intention to kill and penalties are\namong the severest, stretching in various jurisdictions to mandatory\nlife imprisonment or, in some, to capital punishment. But how is\n\u201cdeath\u201d in \u201ccausation of death\u201d to be\nunderstood? It is common to understand it in terms of the cessation of\nbrain stem functioning. But why this understanding? For some putative\nvictim may have irrevocably lost the capacity for consciousness while\nhis or her brain stem continues to function. Is not the wrong of\nmurder truly captured not only when the brain stem ceases functioning,\nbut (possibly before that) when there is such \u201cirrevocable loss\nof the capacity of consciousness\u201d (Persson 2002; De Grazia 2017:\n4.3)? For, one might say, it is the latter that explains what is\nhorrific about murder. Someone who intentionally brings about the\npermanent cessation of the brain stem functioning of another should\nnot be thought of as a murderer, the argument goes, where the capacity\nfor consciousness of the victim is already known to have been\nirrevocably lost. Perhaps such conduct ought still to be criminal and\nlabelled as such, only not as murder meriting the mandatory life\nsentence. The point for present purposes is not to settle the question\nof what the best understanding of murder should be, or whether the\nimaginary case should count as murder, only to suggest that these\nissues are likely to turn, implicitly or explicitly, on comprehensive\nmoral and metaphysical understandings. Public reason will be\ninsufficient-or so the challenge would run (Tadros 2012: 77). Somewhat\nrelatedly is Rawls\u2019 account of abortion\u2014he argues for a\n\u201cduly qualified right\u201d on the part of a woman \u201cto\ndecide whether or not to end her pregnancy during the first\ntrimester\u201d (Rawls 1993: 243). Whether Rawls is entitled to this\nconclusion on the basis of public reason has been hotly contested (see\nthe varying perspectives of George 1997 [1999: 209\u2013213]; J.\nWilliams 2015; Kramer 2017: 92\u2013155; Laborde 2018; Chambers 2018;\nArrell 2019).\n8. Other Directions: Legality, a \u201cModal Kind\u201d and Coercion\n\nIn the Introduction a distinction was drawn between conceptual and\nevaluative questions about the relationship between law and morality;\nand it was said that the limits of law is generally taken to be a\nstrictly evaluative question. The term \u201claw\u201d is generally\nleft largely unanalysed, with the emphasis on the law\u2019s coercive\nmeans and the extent to which it may legitimately be deployed in the\npursuit of moral ends. But will be seen, there are some approaches\nsceptical of the distinction\u2019s importance to our understanding\nof the limits of law.\n\nIt is uncontroversial to say that a (further) kind of limit of law is\nthat contained in the idea of legality. Lon Fuller famously identified\neight \u201cdesiderata\u201d for laws. Laws should be general; they\nshould be promulgated to their norm-subjects; and they should be\nprospective. They should be understandable (perhaps with professional\nhelp); the obligations they impose should be susceptible to being\njointly fulfilled; and they should not require anything beyond the\ncapacities of their norm-subjects. Laws should be tolerably stable\nand, finally, they should actually be upheld by the relevant legal\nofficials, rather than ignored, bypassed or replaced by what the\nofficials applying them consider more congenial standards (Fuller\n1964; Rundle 2012: Ch. 4; Waldron 2016 [2020]; Sunstein & Vermeule\n2020). Kristen Rundle and Jeremy Waldron both argue that the legal\npositivism of Hart and Raz, as well as a broader instrumentalism that\nwould take in\n Devlin,[13]\n is too casual and accommodating in allowing the designation\n\u201clegal system\u201d and \u201claw\u201d to systems and norms\nthat fall short on the criteria of legality (Waldron 2008: 14; Rundle\n2012: 202). This implies that one cannot simply take the question of\nthe limits of law to be an evaluative question. This would\nunderestimate the extent to which supposedly conceptual questions\nabout the existence of legal systems and laws are themselves\nevaluative questions. Hence the limits of the law should be seen\nsquarely as both an evaluative and a conceptual question. Against\nthis, while granting that conceptual questions matter and are\nthemselves a large focus in the philosophy of law, one might wonder\nhow far they matter to the specific issue of the limits of the law. If\nit is accepted for example that Fuller\u2019s desiderata for legality\nor something close to them are indeed desiderata as well as to some\nextent conceptual features of the law (as does Raz 1977), does it\ngreatly matter that one might conceive of such features as conceptual\nto a still greater extent?\n\nIt is widely said by those sympathetic to the instrumentalist\nunderstanding of law that law is a \u201cmodal kind\u201d rather\nthan a \u201cfunctional kind\u201d, distinguished by its means (or\ntechniques) rather than its ends; the moral legitimacy of such ends\nbeing contingent (Green 1996: 1711). In the words of John Gardner:\n\n\n[T]o say that law is a modal as opposed to a functional kind is merely\nto say that law is not distinguished by its functions\u2014by the\npurposes it is capable of serving. It is distinguished rather by the\ndistinctive means that it provides for serving whatever ends it\nserves. Law is what Kelsen memorably called a \u201cspecific social\ntechnique\u201d (Gardner 2012: 195\u2013220, 207; cf. Kelsen 1941;\nSummers 1971).\n\n\nThe idea of the legal techniques, developed by Robert\nSummers, from both the positivism of Hans Kelsen and the\nanti-positivism of Fuller, points however to a line of thought about\nthe limits of the law that is surely due a revival. The debate as it\nis mostly prosecuted is too dominated by the one\n\u201ctechnique\u201d of coercion. While giving coercion its due\nSummers also emphasized\n\n\neducational effort, rewards and other incentives, symbolic deployment\nof legal forms, publicity (favourable or adverse), continuous\nsupervision, public signs and signals, recognized statuses and\nentities\n\n\nand\n\n\ngrants with strings attached. (Summers 1977: 126)\n\n\nThere is also growing awareness at a theoretical level of the\nimportance of expressive values in the law (McAdams 2015). It is\nsomething of a loss that the schema developed by Summers and his\ncollaborators, dividing legal techniques into\n\u201cgrievance-remedial\u201d, \u201cpenal-corrective\u201d,\n\u201cadministrative-regulatory\u201d, \u201cpublic-benefit\nconferral\u201d, \u201cfacilitator of private arrangements\u201d,\nappears to have fallen largely into disuse (Summers et al. 1986). For\nit allowed various areas of potential legal concern to be examined\nagainst a background of various legal techniques, coercive and beyond.\nRawls\u2019 question of how far such techniques should be subject to\npublic reason is a further issue that might helpfully be pressed.\n9. Conclusion\n\n\nThe law\u2019s task, put abstractly, is to secure a situation whereby\nmoral goals which, given the current social situation in the country\nwhose law it is, would be unlikely to be achieved without it, and\nwhose achievement by the law is not counter-productive, are realized.\n(Raz 2003 [2009: 178])\n\n\nThis remark could be taken as the essence of legal moralism. The basic\ncore of legal moralism, as we have seen, is a two-part structure,\ncompounded of a wrong and a set of countervailing and potentially\ndefeating factors, such as liberty and privacy. From within legal\nmoralism there are controversies over how morality should itself be\nconceived and controversies over how the first part of the structure\nshould be conceived\u2014all moral wrongs or only a subset of\nthem?\u2014and the second part\u2014which countervailing factors,\nfor example, make the list? And what, if anything, unifies them? While\nRaz\u2019s remark may serve as a pithy statement of legal moralism,\nRaz himself rejected legal moralism, in favour of a version of the\nharm principle. Mill\u2019s original harm principle was based on a\nmonistic utilitarianism. There remain adherents of such a\nutilitarianism, but more influential today is some version of\nvalue-pluralism, such as Raz\u2019s liberal perfectionism. The\nderivation of the harm principle from such pluralistic premises, is as\nwe have seen, a far from straightforward task. Adherents of the harm\nprinciple also manifest a strong divide between those who broadly\ninherit Mill\u2019s principled anti-moralism without his\nanti-paternalism, such as Hart and Raz and those who inherit both\nMill\u2019s principled anti-moralism and his anti-paternalism, such\nas Feinberg. Into the mix comes Rawlsian public reason. Like one kind\nof legal moralist, there is an emphasis on steering the justification\nof legal coercion to the citizens subject to the coercion themselves\nand from this an aspiration to develop a \u201cmodule\u201d of\npolitical practical reasoning, the public reason of all subjects of a\ngiven legal system independent of the comprehensive ethical or\nreligious commitments of some of their number. For the proponent of\npublic reason it is the \u201czeal to embody the whole truth\u201d\nthat is anathema (Rawls 1999: 132\u2013133). To legal moralists such\nas Moore, the moral truth, with due sensitivity to the countervailing\nfactors, should rather be the point. The idea that the law has\nsometimes no limits to hold back the moral truth\u2014which of\nnecessity must lie in the mouth of some (fallible) human\u2014can\ninduce a feeling of vertigo. Perhaps the question ultimately turns on\nwhether there is a genuine alternative.\n",
