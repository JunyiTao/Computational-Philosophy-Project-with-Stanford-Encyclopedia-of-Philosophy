    "main_text": "Individual versus Trait Fitness\n3. Individual versus Trait Fitness\n \n\nSome philosophers (notably Sober, 2013) have argued that\nevolutionary fitness is a property of populations and not of\nindividual organisms, or alternatively that fitness is a property of\ntraits and not of the individuals that possess them. Individual\nfitness values are, they argue, empirically inaccessible and\npredictively useless. If trait fitness is defined in terms of the\naverage fitness value of individuals bearing the trait, then it will\nturn out that there are individual fitnesses and individual fitness\ndifferences, even if it is the case that evolutionary\nbiologists\u2019 interests are confined to trait fitnesses. This\nclaim has been challenged (cf. Pence and Ramsey 2014): sometimes\nbiologists estimate trait fitnesses by studying individual fitnesses\n(Endler 1986).\n \n\nIt has also been held that trait fitness and fitness difference are\nboth something more than and different from the average of individual\nfitnesses and fitness differences. On this view, trait fitness is a\nproperty of populations and, in part, their population\nstructure\u2014that is, the ways in which traits are distributed in\nthe population. An example (to be explored further below) is reflected\nin cases where the fitness of a trait depends not just on its\nincidence in a population, but also on its variance within. A\ntrait\u2019s variance in a population cannot be reflected in\nindividual fitness any more than the entropy of a volume of gas can be\nreflected in the properties of any of the individual molecules that\ncompose it and contribute to its entropy. This suggests that trait\nfitness is not reducible to, definable in terms of, or even entirely\nsupervenient on the relationship between individuals (e.g., organisms)\nand their environments.\n \n\nThe disagreement about whether fitness is a property of biological\nindividuals (genes, genotypes, organisms, families, populations and\nother groups or even species) as opposed to a property of traits of\nthese individuals, has made significant another debate about the\nexplanatory role of fitness in the theory of natural selection. Among\nthose who endorse trait fitness (differences), and not individual\nfitness (differences), as a fundamental explanatory factor in natural\nselection, there is a dispute about whether its explanatory role\nreflects its causal force, or whether trait fitness is a purely\nstatistical concept employed in the theory of natural selection to\nmake demographic predictions about future trait distributions, without\nentering into any causal nexus among the objects so to speak. Thus,\nMatthen and Ariew (2002, 56) write, \u201cUnlike vernacular\n[individual] fitness, predictive [trait] fitness is not a cause of\nselection, or of evolution for that matter\u2026. [P]redictive\nfitness is a measure of evolutionary change not a cause.\u201d This\nview confers an obligation on those who embrace it to explain how the\ntheory of natural selection can provide contingent explanations\nwithout trading in causal relations among its explanatory\nvariables.\n",
