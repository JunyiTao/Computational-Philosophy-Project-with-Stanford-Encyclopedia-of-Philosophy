    "main_text": "Transcendental Arguments in Philosophy of Psychology and Perception\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nWe have looked in some depth at the role of transcendental arguments\nthat have been given in philosophy, not only in refuting the\nepistemological sceptic, but also in ethics, philosophy of psychology,\nand philosophy of perception. As we have seen, such arguments clearly\nface challenges, both in their details but also at a more general\nlevel, concerning how much they can ever hope to achieve. However,\nwhile these challenges are certainly significant, it would be wrong to\nexaggerate them: for, as we have also seen, the range of potential\nuses for such arguments is wide, while it seems that their intriguing\npower, as well as their alluring promise, will mean that philosophers\nwill continue to be drawn to them. As a result, therefore, it seems\nunlikely that those engaged in the subject will ever cease to feel\nthat \u2018tenderness for transcendental arguments\u2019 (Strawson\n1985: 21) instilled in them by Kant and others.\n",
