    "main_text": "The Function of Political Legitimacy || Political Legitimacy and Political Obligations\n2.3 Political Legitimacy and Political Obligations\n\nHistorically speaking, the dominant view has been that legitimate\npolitical authority entails political obligations. Locke, for example,\nwrites: \u201cevery man, by consenting with others to make one body\npolitic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to\nevery one of that society to submit to the determination of the\nmajority, and to be concluded by it; or else this original compact,\nwhereby he with others incorporates into one society, would signify\nnothing, and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ties\nthan he was in before in the state of nature\u201d (Locke 2009\n[1690]: 52f).\n\nWhile this is still the view many hold, not all do. Some take the\nquestion of what constitutes legitimate authority to be distinct from\nthe question of what political obligations people have. Ronald Dworkin\n(1986: 191) treats political obligations as a fundamental normative\nconcept in its own right. What he calls \u201cassociative\nobligations\u201d arise, not from legitimate political authority, but\ndirectly from membership in a political community. (For a critical\ndiscussion of this account, see Simmons 2001; Wellman 1996.)\n\nArthur Applbaum (2019) offers a conceptual argument to challenge the\nview that legitimate political authority entails an obligation to\nobey. Applbaum grants that legitimate political authority has the\ncapacity to change the normative status of those under its rule, as\nRaz (1986), for example, has influentially argued, and that this\ncapacity should be interpreted as a moral power in Hohfeld\u2019s\nsense, not as a claim right to rule. But, Applbaum argues, Hohfeldian\npowers, unlike rights, are not correlated with duties; they are\ncorrelated with liabilities. On Applbaum\u2019s view, legitimate\npolitical authority thus has the capacity to create a liability for\nthose under its rule, but not an obligation. To be liable to\nlegitimate political authority means to not be free from the\nauthority\u2019s power or control. To be sure, the liability might be\nto be subject to a duty, but to be liable to be put under a duty to\nobey should not be confused with being under a duty to obey (see also\nPerry 2013 on this distinction).\n\nViews that dissociate legitimate authority from political obligation\nhave some appeal to those who aim to counter Robert Paul Wolff\u2019s\ninfluential anarchist argument. The argument highlights what today is\nsometimes called the subjection problem (Perry 2013): how can\nautonomous individuals be under a\ngeneral\u2014content-independent\u2014obligation to subject their\nwill to the will of someone else? A content-independent obligation to\nobey the state is an obligation to obey a state\u2019s directives as\nsuch, independently of their content. Wolff (1970) argues that because\nthere cannot be such a general obligation to obey the state, states\nare necessarily illegitimate.\n\nEdmundson (1998) has a first response to the anarchist challenge. He\nargues that while legitimacy establishes a justification for the state\nto issue directives, it does not create even a prima facie duty to\nobey its commands. He claims that the moral duty to obey the commands\nof legitimate political authority arises only if additional conditions\nare met.\n\nSimmons (2001) has a different response to Wolff. Simmons draws a\ndistinction between the moral justification of states and the\npolitical legitimacy of a particular, historically realized, state and\nits directives. According to Simmons, the state\u2019s justification\ndepends on its moral defensibility. If it can successfully be shown\nthat having a state is morally better than not having a state (Simmons\n2001: 125), the state is justified. But moral justification is only\nnecessary, not sufficient, for political legitimacy, according to\nSimmons. The reason is that our moral obligations are to everyone,\nincluding citizens of other states, not to the particular state we\nlive in. A particular state\u2019s legitimacy, understood as the\ncapacity to generate and enforce a duty to obey, depends on\ncitizens\u2019 actual consent. While there is no general moral duty\nto obey the particular state we live in, we may have a political\nobligation to obey if we have given our prior consent to this state.\nThe absence of a general moral duty to obey the state thus does not\nimply that all states are necessarily illegitimate (Simmons 2001:\n137).\n",
