Conclusion\n\nSense-datum theorists and adverbialists depart substantially from our\nordinary conception of perceptual experience. Advocates of each view\nwill argue, in their different ways, that this is a consequence of\nresponding adequately to the Problem of Perception. \n\nIntentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists disagree, and argue,\nin different ways, that we can respond to the Problem of Perception\nwithout departing substantially from our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience: by maintaining Direct Realism\nin some form, and maintaining or at least being sensitive to many of\nthe specific phenomenological components of our ordinary conception of\nperceptual experience.\n\n\nWhilst the debate between sense-datum theorists and adverbialists (and\nbetween these and other theories) is not as prominent as it once was,\nthe debate between intentionalists and naive realist disjunctivists is\na significant ongoing debate in the philosophy of perception: a legacy\nof the Problem of Perception that is arguably \u201cthe greatest\nchasm\u201d in the philosophy of perception (Crane (2006)). The\nquestion, now, is not so much whether to be a direct realist,\nbut how to be one.\n",
