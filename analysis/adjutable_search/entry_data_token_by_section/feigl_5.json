Feigl and Twentieth-Century Analytical Philosophy\n\nFeigl\u2019s role in the development of twentieth-century analytical\nphilosophy is not to be underrated. His 1950 article on\n\u201cExistential Hypotheses\u201d can, as has been argued (cf.\nNeuber 2011), be regarded as a ground-breaking contribution to the\ndebate over scientific realism within the analytical tradition. In\nparticular his focusing on the semantic notions of reference and truth\nturned out as instructive for the following development, as it is\nrepresented in the (programmatically diverse) writings of Richard\nBoyd, Larry Laudan, and specifically Hilary Putnam. In recent times,\nthe attempt has been made to revive Feigl\u2019s point of view by\nsystematically exploiting the idea of \u201cchoosing the realist\nframework\u201d (see Psillos 2011). Similarly, Feigl\u2019s analysis\nof the mind-body problem exerted remarkable influence on the\nphilosophical discourse of the second half of the twentieth century.\nThus, according to Jaegwon Kim, \u201cit was the papers by Smart and\nFeigl that introduced the mind-body problem as mainstream metaphysical\nProblematik of analytical philosophy, and launched the debate that has\ncontinued to this day\u201d (Kim 1998, p. 1). To be sure, alternative\napproaches, such as Putnam\u2019s \u2018functionalism\u2019 or\nDonald Davidson\u2019s \u2018anomalous monism\u2019 came up quite\nearly in the discussion. Nevertheless, Feigl\u2019s (and\nSmart\u2019s) account \u201chelped set basic parameters and\nconstraints for the debates that were to come\u2014a set of broadly\nphysicalist assumptions and aspirations that still guide and constrain\nour thinking today\u201d (ibid., p. 2)\n\nBesides these contributions to the theoretical discourse, Feigl played\nan important role at the institutional level. He not only founded and\nheaded the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science, but he also, in\n1949, founded and co-edited the (still existing) journal\nPhilosophical Studies and, in 1956, the series Minnesota\nStudies in the Philosophy of Science. Moreover, he edited such\nstandard setting volumes as Readings in Philosophical\nAnalysis (1949, together with Wilfrid Sellars) and Readings\nin the Philosophy of Science (1953, together with May Brodbeck).\nFurthermore, it should be emphasized that Feigl, together with Paul\nMeehl, energetically promoted the revalorization of\npsychology as a serious academic discipline. The Minnesota\nCenter was an extremely influential forum in this connection (for\nfurther details, see Smith 1986).\n\nBeing a scientific philosopher par excellence, Feigl once\ndeclared:\n\n[T]here is no sharp line of demarcation between (good) science and\n(clearheaded) philosophy. Every major scientific advance involves\nrevisions of our conceptual frameworks; and doing philosophy in our\ndays and age without regard to the problems and results of the\nsciences is\u2014to put it mildly\u2014intellectually unprofitable,\nif not irresponsible. (1967, p. 137)\n\n\nThis diagnosis, though provocative, is still accurate today.\n",
