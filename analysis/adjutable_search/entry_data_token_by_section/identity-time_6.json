    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles || Constitution\n4.1 Constitution\n\nConstitution accounts pivot on the distinction between constitution\nand identity. Defenders of such accounts hold that constitution,\nunlike identity, is not an equivalence relation (Baker 2002).\nConstitution is said to be, at least, non-symmetrical. According to a\nconstitution account, we say the following about the three types of\npuzzle cases described above. Cup is never identical with Tcup. Later\nCup is constituted by Tcup [alternatively: Cup and Tcup never\nconstitute each other, but later are constituted from the very same\natoms]. Likewise the lump of clay is never identical with the statue,\nbut earlier only constitutes the statue. Finally, the reassembly ship\nis never identical, but only constituted from exactly the same planks\nas, the original.\n\nKit Fine has deployed a number of novel Leibniz's Law arguments in\nfavour of a constitution accounts. Such arguments are replied to by\nBrian Frances in Frances 2006.\n\nThe constitution view has come in for its share of criticisms. Some\nthink it engages in metaphysical multiple vision, seeing a\nmultiplicity of things at a given place and time where there is\nplausibly only one. Others argue that constitution is\nidentity (see Noonan 1993).\n\nA number of objections have been raised against constitution views.\nOne is an objection from causal overdetermination. Another is an\nobjection from grounding. Consider a statue allegedly constituted from\na statue shaped piece of clay. Someone throws the statue against a\npane of glass, which breaks. What caused the glass to break? Surely,\nthe statue impacting it. But the glass was also impacted by the statue\nshaped piece of clay with sufficient force to break it. So, if\nconstitution is not identity, the glass breaking has two causes. Some\nwould say that is one cause too many.\n\nThe objection from grounding is not so much an objection to the\nconstitution view, but an objection designed to undermine a principle\nreason for adopting it. A principle reason for adopting the\nconstitution view is that it seems to allow, for example, the statue\nand the piece of clay to have different properties. In particular, it\nseems to allow them to have different modal properties such as being\nsquashable. Since constitution, unlike identity, does not conform to\nthe indiscernibility of identicals, the clay can be squashable even if\nthe statue is not.\n\nThe problem is that the clay and the statue are made up of exactly the\nsame atoms organized in the same way. Since that is so it is hard to\nsee how the clay can be squashable without the statue being so as\nwell.\n\nA further problem for constitution views is the so called too many\nminds objection (see Olsen 1997 and Shoemaker 1999). Advocates of\nconstitutionalism typically hold that a person is constituted by a\nliving organism. If so, the person and the living organism\nconstituting that person share the same thoughts. Whenever you\nencounter a person you encounter a distinct living organism having\noccupying the same region and having the same thoughts. Not a good\nresult.\n",
