    "main_text": "Accounts of Self-Knowledge || Inner Sense Accounts\n3.2 Inner Sense Accounts\n\nWhile acquaintance accounts construe introspection as fundamentally\ndifferent from perception in its epistemic and metaphysical\ndirectness, inner sense accounts take the opposite tack: they construe\nintrospection as similar to perception in crucial respects.\n\nLocke, an early inner sense theorist, described the introspective\nfaculty as follows.\n\n\nThis Source of Ideas, every Man has wholly in himself \u2026 And\nthough it be not Sense, as having nothing to do with external Objects;\nyet it is very like it, and might properly enough be call\u2019d\ninternal Sense. (Locke 1689/1975: II.1.iv.)\n\n\nInner sense accounts construe introspection as similar to perception\nin that it involves a monitoring mechanism or \u201cself-scanning\nprocess\u201d (Armstrong 1993: 324) that takes mental states as input\nand yields representations of those states as output. The monitoring\nmechanism involved in inner sense forms representations of the mental\nstates it takes as input. This process is reliable, according to some\ninner sense accounts, because the mechanism \u201credeploys\u201d\nthe content of the input state in the representation of those states\nthat is its output (Nichols and Stich 2003; Goldman 2006). On such\naccounts, and in contrast to acquaintance accounts, the connection\nbetween the introspected state (the input) and the introspective state\n(the output) is causal and contingent. But inner sense accounts allow\nthat introspection also differs from perception in significant ways.\nPerception is achieved through dedicated organs such as eyes and ears,\nwhereas there is no (literal) organ of introspection. Perception\nordinarily involves sensory experiences, whereas \u201cNo one thinks\nthat one is aware of beliefs and thoughts by having sensations or\nquasi-sense-experiences of them\u201d (Shoemaker 1994: 255).\n\nBecause inner sense accounts construe introspection as a causal\nprocess, they are particularly well-suited to reliabilist (or, more\nbroadly, epistemically externalist) approaches to self-knowledge. For\nexample, Armstrong characterizes the introspective process as \u201ca\nmere flow of information or beliefs\u201d (Armstrong 1993: 326). The\ncausal connections involved in self-monitoring need not be known by\nthe subject in order to deliver self-knowledge, and inner sense\naccounts generally regard knowledge based in introspection as\nnon-inferential. Inner sense is a first-personal method because the\nrelevant scanners or monitoring mechanisms are directed only towards\none\u2019s own states. Strikingly, however, this asymmetry of access\nis merely contingent. It is possible, in principle, for one\u2019s\n\u201cinner sense\u201d mechanism to be linked to someone\nelse\u2019s mental states, thereby allowing for \u201cdirect [read:\nnon-inferential] awareness of the mental states of others\u201d,\nthrough a kind of telepathic scanning (Armstrong 1993: 124).\n\nPerhaps the chief benefit of inner sense accounts is that they are\nespecially conducive to a broadly naturalistic picture of mentality.\nBy assimilating introspection to perception, inner sense accounts\nconstrue mentality as epistemically continuous with the nonmental, and\nthus allow a single overarching epistemology to apply to both\nself-knowledge and knowledge of external things. Since most of the\nleading arguments for mind-body dualism depend on the claim that our\nepistemic relations to mental states diverge in crucial ways from our\nepistemic relations to physical objects, the claim that the mental is\nepistemically continuous with the nonmental paves the way for\nassimilating mentality to the nonmental realm ontologically as\n well.[4]\n\nShoemaker (1994) offers a sustained critique of inner sense accounts.\nHis main objection centers on the charge that, in construing the\ncapacity for self-knowledge as similar to sensory capacities like\nvision, inner sense accounts imply that the capacity for\nself-knowledge is one that a rational person might lack. As he puts\nthis, they imply that a rational creature could be\n\u201cself-blind\u201d, unable to recognize its own mental states.\nBut, he says, self-blindness is impossible in a rational creature (at\nleast, one with ordinary mental states and who possesses mental state\nconcepts). Shoemaker\u2019s discussion has been as influential for\nits positive suggestion\u2014that our capacity for self-knowledge is\nclosely tied to rationality (see\n 3.6\n and\n 3.7)\u2014as\n for its critical treatment of inner sense accounts.\n\nKind (2003) contends that the possibility of self-blindness does not\ndirectly threaten inner sense accounts. Even if Shoemaker is right\nthat rational creatures will generally be capable of self-awareness,\nthis conclusion is silent as to how such awareness occurs. So\nit does not rule out the possibility that it is achieved through inner\nsense. Gertler (2011a: ch. 5) argues that the inner sense theorist can\nblock Shoemaker\u2019s objection by stipulating that no creature\nqualifies as rational if it is self-blind. \u201cNo rational\ncreature is self-blind\u201d would then be a de dicto truth and,\nas such, is compatible with the inner sense account. Shoemaker\u2019s\nchallenge to inner sense views requires a stronger thesis, namely that\nthe capacity for self-knowledge is a de re necessary\ncharacteristic of rational beings: that is, rational beings must be\ncapable of self-knowledge in order to exist at all.\n\nAnother objection to inner sense accounts targets their epistemic\nexternalism. Inner sense accounts are not likely to appeal to those\nwho take self-knowledge to involve internal or accessible reasons for\nbelief (Peacocke 1999: 224). \n",
