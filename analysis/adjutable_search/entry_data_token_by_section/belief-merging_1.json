    "main_text": "Belief Merging || A framework for merging under integrity constraints\n2.1 A framework for merging under integrity constraints\n\nKonieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez consider a propositional language\nL built up from a finite set At of atomic propositions\nand the usual connectives \\((\\neg, \\land, \\lor , \\rightarrow,\n\\leftrightarrow )\\). An interpretation is a total function \\(At\n\\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\) that assigns 0 (false) or 1 (true) to each\natomic proposition. For example, if \\(At =\\{p, q, r\\}\\), then \\((1, 0,\n1)\\) is the interpretation that assigns true to p and r\nand false to\n q.[1]\n Denote the set of all interpretations by \\(W = \\{0, 1\\}^{At}\\). For\nany formula \\(\\varphi \\in L\\), \\(\\mymod(\\varphi) = \\{\\omega \\in W |\n\\omega \\models \\varphi\\}\\) denotes the set of models of \\(\\varphi\\),\ni.e., the set of truth assignments that makes \\(\\varphi\\) true. If we\ntake the formula that expressed the contractual law in the doctrinal\nexample, then \\(\\mymod((p\\land q) \\leftrightarrow r) = \\{(1,1,1), (1,\n0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0,0,0)\\}.\\) As usual, a formula \\(\\varphi\\) is\nconsistent if it has at least a model, and a formula \\(\\varphi\\)\nfollows from a set of formulae \\(\\Phi\\) if every interpretation that\nmakes all formulae in \\(\\Phi\\) true, makes also \\(\\varphi\\) true.\n\nA belief base \\(K_i\\) is a finite set of propositional\nformulas representing the explicit beliefs held by individual\ni. Each \\(K_{i}\\) is assumed to be consistent. \\(\\mathcal{K}\\)\ndenotes the set of all consistent belief bases. The postulates for\nmerging consider a multi-set of belief bases (belief\nprofile, or belief set, the terminology used in early\npapers) \\(E = \\{K_1, \\ldots , K_{n}\\}\\). The reason for using\nmulti-sets is that an element can appear more than once, thus allowing\nthe representation of the fact that two or more agents can hold the\nsame beliefs. This is needed to take into account the popularity of a\npiece of information, hence to define majority operators. To mark the\ndistinction with the usual set union \\(\\cup\\), the multi-set union is\ndenoted by \\(\\sqcup\\) and defined as \\(\\{\\varphi\\} \\sqcup \\{\\varphi\\}\n= \\{\\varphi, \\varphi\\}\\). Two belief profiles are equivalent\n\\((E_1\\equiv E_{2})\\) if and only if there exists a bijection f\nfrom \\(E_1\\) to \\(E_{2}\\) such that, for any \\(B\\in E_1\\), we have\nthat \\(\\models\\land f(B)\\leftrightarrow \\land B\\).\n\nIntegrity constraints represent extra conditions that should follow\nfrom the merged bases. The interest of integrity constraints is to\nensure that the aggregation of individual pieces of information\nsatisfies some problem-specific requirement. For example, suppose that\nmembers of a city council have to decide what to build in a certain\narea. We can have constraints on the available budget (enough to cover\nonly some of the projects) but also constraints on the coexistence of\ndifferent projects (we may not build a parking lot and a playground in\nthat area, but we may build a playground and a public library). If the\n(possibly empty) set of integrity constraints is denoted by the belief\nbase IC, \\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E)\\) denotes the result of merging\nthe multi-set E of belief bases given IC. Intuitively,\nthe result will be a consistent belief base representing the\ncollective beliefs and implying IC.\n\nKonieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez (1999, 2002) put forward the following\npostulates for IC fusion operators between equally reliable\nsources. Let \\(E\\), \\(E_1\\), \\(E_{2}\\), be belief profiles, \\(K_1\\),\n\\(K_{2}\\) be consistent belief bases, and \\(\\IC\\), \\(\\IC_1\\),\n\\(\\IC_{2}\\), be integrity constraints. \\(\\Delta\\) is an IC\nfusion operator if and only if it satisfies the following rationality\npostulates:\n\n(IC0)\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E) \\models \\IC\\)\n(IC1)\nIf \\(\\IC\\) is consistent, then \\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E)\\) is\nconsistent.\n(IC2)\nIf \\(\\land E\\) is consistent with IC, then\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E)\\equiv \\land E\\land \\IC\\)\n(IC3)\nIf \\(E_1\\equiv E_{2}\\), and \\(\\IC_1\\equiv \\IC_{2}\\), then\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC_1}(E_1)\\equiv \\Delta_{\\IC_2}(E_{2})\\)\n(IC4)\nIf \\(K_1 \\models\\IC\\) and \\(K_{2} \\models\\IC\\), then\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(\\{K_1, K_{2}\\})\\land K_1\\) is consistent if and only if\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(\\{K_1, K_{2}\\})\\land K_{2}\\) is consistent.\n(IC5)\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_1) \\land \\Delta_{\\IC}(E_{2})\n\\models\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_1\\sqcup E_{2})\\)\n(IC6)\nIf \\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_1) \\land \\Delta_{\\IC}(E_{2})\\) is consistent,\nthen \\(\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_1\\sqcup E_{2}) \\models \\Delta_{\\IC}(E_1) \\land\n\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_{2})\\)\n(IC7)\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC_{1}}(E) \\land \\IC_{2} \\models\\Delta_{\\IC_{1\\land}\n\\IC_{2}} (E)\\)\n(IC8)\nIf \\(\\Delta_{\\IC_1}(E) \\land \\IC_{2}\\) is consistent, then\n\\(\\Delta_{\\IC_{1\\land}\\IC_{2}} (E) \\models\\Delta_{\\IC_1}(E)\\)\n\n\nIn order to illustrate these postulates, we consider the following\nexample, due to (Konieczny and Pino P\u00e9rez 1999). A group of\nflats co-owners wish to improve their condominium. At the meeting, the\nchairman proposes to build a tennis court, a swimming pool or a\nprivate parking. He also points out that building two of the three\noptions will lead to a significant increase of the yearly maintenance\nexpenses (this corresponds to the IC). \n\n(IC0) ensures that the resulting merged base satisfies the integrity\nconstraints. This is an obvious condition to impose since these are\npostulates for merging under integrity constraints, where the idea is\nto ensure that the result of the merging satisfies the integrity\nconstraints. By employing a merging operator, the chairman knows that\nthe group will agree on the increase of the expenses, if they decide\nto build at least two of the three facilities. (IC1) states that, when\nIC is consistent, then the result of the fusion operator will\nalso be consistent. Again, given that the interpretations of the\nmerged bases are selected among the interpretations of the integrity\nconstraints, if IC is consistent, the result will also be\nconsistent. (IC2) states that the result of the merging operator is\nsimply the conjunction of the belief profile and the IC,\nwhenever such conjunction is consistent. In our running example, if\neach person wishing to build two or more facilities endorses the rise\nof the expenses and the opinions given by the co-owners are\nconsistent, then the merging will just return the conjunction of the\nIC and the individual opinions. (IC3) states that if two\nbelief profiles \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_{2}\\) are logically equivalent and\n\\(\\IC_1\\) and \\(\\IC_{2}\\) are also equivalent, then merging the first\nbelief profile with \\(\\IC_1\\) will be equivalent as merging the second\nbelief profile with \\(\\IC_{2}\\). This postulate expresses a principle\nalready imposed on belief revision operators (of which, as we shall\nsee, merging operators are extensions), that is, the principle of\nirrelevance of syntax, which says that the result of a merging\noperator depends only on the semantical content of the merged bases\nand not on their syntactical expression. (IC4) is known as the\nfairness postulate because it states that when merging two\nbelief bases \\(K_1\\) and \\(K_{2}\\), no priority should be given to one\nof them. The merging is consistent with one of them if and only if it\nis consistent with the other. This postulate expresses a symmetric\ncondition that operators that give priority to one of the two bases\nwill not satisfy. (IC5) and (IC6) were first introduced in (Revesz\n1997) and together they mean that if two groups agree on at least one\nitem, then the result of the fusion will coincide with those items on\nwhich the two groups agreed on. So, if the group of co-owners can be\nsplit in two parties, such that one wants to build the tennis court\nand the swimming pool and the other wants the swimming pool and the\nparking, the building of the swimming pool will be selected as the\nfinal group decision. Finally, (IC7) and (IC8) guarantee that if the\nconjunction between the merging on \\(E\\) under \\(\\IC_1\\) and\n\\(\\IC_{2}\\) is consistent, then \\(\\IC_1\\) will remain satisfied if\n\\(E\\) is merged under a more restrictive condition, that is, the\nconjunction of \\(\\IC_1\\) and \\(\\IC_{2}\\). This is a natural\nrequirement to impose as, less formally, (IC7) and (IC8) together\nstate that if the swimming pool is chosen among the set of three\nalternatives, it will still be selected if we reduce the set of\nalternatives to the tennis court and swimming pool. The last two\npostulates are a generalization of two postulates for revision (R5 and\nR6) in (Katsuno and Mendelzon 1991), who analyzed the revision\noperator from a model-theoretic point of view and gave a\ncharacterization of revision operators satisfying the AGM rationality\npostulates (Alchourr\u00f3n et al. 1985) in terms of minimal change\nwith respect to an ordering over interpretations. Like Katsuno and\nMendelzon\u2019s postulates, (IC7) and (IC8) ensure that the notion\nof closeness is well behaved, in the sense that if an outcome is\nselected by the merging operator under \\(\\IC_1\\), then that outcome\nwill also be the closest (i.e., it will be selected) to \\(\\IC_{2}\\)\nwithin the more restrictive constraint \\(\\IC_1 \\land \\IC_{2}\\)\n(assuming \\(\\Delta_{\\IC_1}(E) \\land \\IC_{2}\\) to be consistent). In\nKatsuno and Mendelzon model-theoretic approach, revision operators\nchange the initial belief base by choosing the closest interpretation\nin the new information. Similarly, IC merging operators\nselect the closest interpretation in the integrity constraints to the\nset of belief bases. Hence, belief merging can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of belief revision to multiple belief bases\n(Gr\u00e9goire and Konieczny 2006). \n\nTwo sub-classes of \\(\\IC\\) fusion operators are defined. An IC\nmajority fusion operator minimizes the level of total\ndissatisfaction (as introduced by Lin and Mendelzon 1996), whereas an\nIC arbitration operator aims at equally distributing the\nlevel of individual dissatisfaction among the agents. The majority\noperator is similar in spirit to the utilitarian approach in social\nchoice theory, whereas the arbitration is inspired to\negalitarianism.\n\nLet, for every integer \\(n\\), \\(E^n\\) denote the multi-set containing\nn times E. An IC majority operator satisfies\nthe following additional postulate:\n\n(Maj)\n \\(\\exists n\n\\Delta_{\\IC} (E_1\\sqcup E^{n}_{2})\n\\models\\Delta_{\\IC}(E_{2})\\)\n\n\nThus, (Maj) states that enough repetitions of \\(E_{2}\\) will make\n\\(E_{2}\\) the opinion of the group. The number of repetitions needed\ndepends on the specific instance.\n\nAn IC arbitration operator is characterized by the following\npostulate, in addition to (IC0)\u2013(IC8):\n\n(Arb)\n Let IC1 and IC2\nbe logically independent. If \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Delta_{\\IC_1}(K_1) &\\equiv \\Delta_{\\IC_2}(K_{2}), \\textrm{ and}\\\\ \n\\Delta_{\\IC_{1} \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\IC_{2}} (\\{K_1, K_{2}\\}) &\\equiv\n  (\\IC_1\\leftrightarrow \\neg \\IC_{2}), \\textrm{ then} \\\\\n\\Delta_{\\IC_{1}\\lor \\IC_{2}} (\\{K_1, K_{2}\\}) &\\equiv \\Delta_{\\IC_1}(K_1).\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIntuitively, this axiom states that the arbitration operator selects\nthe median outcomes that are IC-consistent. The behavior of\nsuch operator will be clearer when expressed in a model-theoretical\nway, as we shall see in the next section.\n\nAn example can help to appreciate the different behavior of a majority\nand an arbitration operator. Suppose three friends need to decide\nwhether to buy a birthday present for a common acquaintance. Suppose\nnow that two of them want to buy her a book and invite her out for\ndinner, while the third friend does not want to contribute to either\nof those presents. If the group takes its decision by majority, the\nthree friends would resolve to buy a book and to invite her out for\ndinner, making the third friend very unhappy. If, on the other hand,\nthey use an arbitration operator, they would either buy her a book or\ninvite her out to a restaurant, making the three members equally\ndissatisfied. Everyone has exactly one formula in their belief base\nthat is not being satisfied, so the \u201camount\u201d of\ndissatisfaction for each friend is the same.\n\nThe fusion operators in the literature can be divided into two\nclasses: syntax-based fusion and model-based fusion.\nThe first type takes the propositional formulas as the information\ninput, and typically considers the maximally consistent subsets of the\nbelief profile. In a model-based operator, on the other hand, it is\nthe interpretations of the formulas that are considered as inputs to\nthe merging process. Hence, each belief base is seen as a set of\nmodels and the syntactic representation of its formulas is irrelevant.\nRecall the example we used at the beginning of\n Section 2\n to illustrate that the combination of belief bases is\nsyntax-dependent. We had \\(K_1 = \\{a, b\\}\\), \\(K_2 = \\{a \\wedge b\\}\\)\nand \\(K_3 = \\{\\neg b\\}\\). A syntax-based fusion would treat \\(a, b, a\n\\wedge b, \\neg b\\) as inputs, whereas a model-based fusion would take\n\\(mod(K_1) = mod(K_2) = \\{(1, 1)\\}\\) and \\(mod(K_3) = \\{(1,0),\n(0,0)\\}\\). Since model-based operators have been applied to the\nproblem of judgment aggregation, we will focus on that class of\nmerging operators and refer to (Baral et al. 1992; Konieczny 2000;\nGr\u00e9goire and Konieczny 2006) for more on syntax-based\nfusion.\n",
