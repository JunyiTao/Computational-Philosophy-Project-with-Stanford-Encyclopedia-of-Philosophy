    "main_text": "Objections Against Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics || Retrocausality Requires Fine Tuning\n7.4 Contextuality for Exotic Causal Structures\n\nRecall\n (\u00a73.2)\n that Spekkens\u2019 (2005) claim that no noncontextual ontological\nmodel can reproduce the observed statistics of quantum theory based on\nhis principle of parsimony (that there can be no ontological\ndifference without operational difference) was sidestepped by\nretrocausal approaches due to the explicit assumption of the\nontological models framework that the ontic state is independent of\nthe measurement procedure (i.e., that there is no retrocausality). It\nwas noted there the possibility that Spekkens\u2019 principle of\nparsimony might be recast to apply more generally to retrocausal\nmodels. Shrapnel and Costa (2018) achieve just this in a no-go theorem\nthat applies to any exotic causal structure used to sidestep the\nontological models framework, including retrocausal accounts,\nrendering such models contextual after all.\n\nShrapnel and Costa\u2019s result is based on a generalization of the\nontological models framework which replaces the operational\npreparation, transformation, and measurement procedures with the\ntemporally and causally neutral notions of local controllables and\nenvironmental processes that mediate correlations between different\nlocal systems, and generate the joint statistics for a set of events.\n\u201cThese include any global properties, initial states, connecting\nmechanisms, causal influence, or global dynamics\u201d (2018: 5).\nFurthermore, they replace the ontic state \\(\\lambda\\) with the ontic\n\u201cprocess\u201d \\(\\omega\\):\n\n\nour ontic process captures the physical properties of the world that\nremain invariant under our local operations. That is, although we\nallow local properties to change under specific operations,\nwe wish our ontic process to capture those aspects of reality\nthat are independent of this probing. (2018: 8)\n\n\nAs a result, the notion of \\(\\lambda\\)-mediation (encountered in\n \u00a74.1)\n is replaced by the notion of \\(\\omega\\)-mediation, in which the ontic\nprocess \\(\\omega\\) completely specifies the properties of the\nenvironment that mediate correlations between regions, and screens off\noutcomes produced by local controllables from the rest of the\nenvironment. Shrapnel and Costa (2018: 9) define the notion of\n\u201cinstrument noncontextuality\u201d as a law of parsimony (along\nthe lines of Spekkens\u2019 own definition of noncontextuality):\n\u201cOperationally indistinguishable pairs of outcomes and local\ncontrollables should remain indistinguishable at the ontological\nlevel\u201d. They then show that no instrument noncontextual model\ncan reproduce the quantum statistical predictions.\n\n\nCrucially, what is contextual is not just the traditional notion of\n\u201cstate\u201d, but any supposedly objective feature of the\ntheory, such as a dynamical law or boundary condition. (2018: 2)\n\n\nSince preparations, transformations, and measurements have been\nreplaced by local controllables, there is no extra assumption in\nShrapnel and Costa\u2019s framework that \\(\\omega\\) is correlated\nwith some controllables but independent of others. Thus the usual\nroute out of the ontological models framework, and so the no-go\ntheorems of\n \u00a73,\n open to retrocausal approaches\u2014that the framework assumes no\nretrocausality\u2014is closed off in the Shrapnel-Costa theorem,\nrendering retrocausal approaches contextual along with the rest of the\nmodels captured by the ontological models framework.\n\nThis presents a significant worry for retrocausal approaches to\nquantum theory. If the main motivation for pursing the hypothesis of\nretrocausality is to recapture in some sense a classical ontology for\nquantum theory (see\n \u00a73.4),\n then the Shrapnel-Costa theorem has made this task either impossible,\nor beholden to the possibility of some further story explaining how\nthe contextual features of the model arise from some noncontextual\nfooting. On this latter point, it is difficult to see how this story\nmight be told without significantly reducing the ideological economy\nof the conceptual framework of retrocausality, again jeopardizing a\npotential virtue of retrocausality (see Evans 2020 for further\ndiscussion of this point).\n\nAs mentioned above\n (\u00a77.3),\n contextuality can be construed as a form of fine tuning (Cavalcanti\n2018; Adlam 2021), especially when the demand for noncontextuality is\nunderstood as a requirement of parsimony, as above. The worries raised\nin this section and the last underline the fact that the challenge to\naccount for various types of fine tuning is the most serious\nprincipled obstacle that retrocausal accounts continue to face.\n",
