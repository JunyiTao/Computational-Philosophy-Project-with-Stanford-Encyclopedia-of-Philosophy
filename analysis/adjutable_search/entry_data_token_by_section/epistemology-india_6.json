    "main_text": "Perception\n4. Perception\n\n\nAll the classical schools that advance epistemologies accept\nperception as a knowledge source although there is much disagreement\nabout its nature, objects, and limitations. Are the objects of\nperception internal to consciousness or external? Are they restricted\nto individuals, e.g., a particular cow, or are universals, e.g.,\ncowhood, also perceived? How about relations? Absences or negative\nfacts (Devadatta\u2019s not being at home)? Parts or wholes? Both? A self,\nawareness itself? There are issues about perceptual media such as light\nand ether, \u0101k\u0101\u015ba, the purported medium\nof sound, and about what is perceptible yogically (God, the\n\u012b\u015bvara, the \u0101tman or\nself, puru\u1e63a). What are the environmental\nconditions that govern perception, and how do these connect with the\ndifferent sensory modalities? Are there internal conditions on\nperception (such as attention or focus, viewed by some as a voluntary\nact)? Is a recognition, e.g., \u201cThis is that Devadatta I saw yesterday,\u201d\nperceptual? And does it prove the endurance of things over time\nincluding the perceiving subject? Do we perceive only fleeting\nqualities (dharma), as Buddhists tend to say, or qualifiers as\nqualifying qualificanda (a lotus as qualified by being-blue), as say\nrealist Ny\u0101ya and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101? Does all perception\ninvolve a sensory connection with an object that is responsible for\nproviding its content or intentionality\n(nir\u0101k\u0101ra-v\u0101da, Ny\u0101ya), or is the content\nof perception internal to itself (s\u0101k\u0101ra-v\u0101da,\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra)? How do we differentiate veritable perception,\nwhich is defined as veridical, and pseudo-perception (illusion), which\nis non-veridical? How is illusion to be explained? These are some of\nthe outstanding issues and questions that occupy the schools in all\nperiods of their literatures.\n\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra subjectivism views perception as\n\u201cconcept-free,\u201d whereas the holist grammarian\nBhart\u1e5bhari of the third century finds it all to be clothed in\nlanguage.  M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ny\u0101ya realists\nemphasize the \u201cconcept-laden\u201d nature of at least the type\nof perception that is epistemically foundational for observation\nstatements containing basic sensory predicates. To be sure,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and later Ny\u0101ya also admit\nconcept-free perception. Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da mentions the\ncognition of an infant as an example\n(\u015aloka-v\u0101rttika commentary on the perception\ns\u016btra of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra,\nverse 112, p. 94; see also Matilal 1986, 321\u2013322). Phenomenologically\nhumans would seem to have much in common with infants and animals\nconsidering this type of perception. But according to the great\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka, perception does not so much divide into\ntypes as form a process with the concept-free as the first\nstage. Awareness of the object is only quasi-propositional in the\nfirst moment, and at the second has its content filled out to become\nthe means whereby an individual is ascertained to have a certain\ncharacter, to be a certain kind of substance or to possess a universal\nor an action, etc. (verse 120, p. 96). The object perceived, the lotus\n(or whatever), is known in the first stage as an individual whole,\nboth in its individuality and as having a character. But the\ncharacter, the thing\u2019s being blue as opposed to red, and its being\nhere right now, are not known without the mediation of concepts which\nare supplied internally. Seeing is ultimately \u201cseeing as\u201d\nand is \u201cshot through with words,\u201d to use the expression of\nBhart\u1e5bhari (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, ch. 1, verses\n123\u2013124, p. 199; see also Matilal 1986, 342). However, the mind or\nself does not, according to the realists, have any innate ideas\n(unlike then Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, which postulates a collective\n\u201cstorehouse\nconsciousness,\u201d \u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na).\nConcepts are the records of previous experiences.\n\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra holds that all predication, including the\nsensory, depends on ideas of unreal generality. All predication\ninvolves repeatable general terms. Thus the realists\u2019 \u201cpropositional\ncontent\u201d is suspicious just because this is not raw perception which\nalone is capable of presenting the truly real, the\nsva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a, \u201cthat\nwhich is its own mark,\u201d the unique or particular. Classical Indian\nrealists hold that perception is none the worse for being concept-laden\nin that concepts are features of the world as impressed upon the mind\nor self. Perception founds true beliefs, and the repeatable predicates\nand concepts (cowhood) perceptually acquired and re-presented and\nemployed in verbalizations pick out constituents of real objects,\nthings that do re-occur (there are lots of cows in the world). For late\nNy\u0101ya philosophers, concept-laden perception comes so to dwarf in\nimportance the indeterminate, concept-free variety that the latter\nbecomes problematic. Perception in its epistemological role is\nconcept-laden. Otherwise, it could not be certificational. Perception\nas a knowledge source is a doxastic, belief-generating process. Beliefs\n(or anyhow perceptual cognitions and their verbalizations) are\ndependent on concepts (to believe or say that there is a pot on the\nfloor, one must possess the concepts of \u201cpot\u201d and \u201cfloor\u201d).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists\u2019 best argument for their\nsubjectivism\u2014which one suspects derives more fundamentally from a\ncommitment to the possibility of a universal\nnirv\u0101\u1e47a experience, although this is\nnot said\u2014is perceptual illusion. Illusion proves that a perception\u2019s\nobject is not a feature of the world but is contributed somehow from\nthe side of the subject. A rope can be perceived as a snake, with no\ndifference, from the perspective of the perceiver, between the illusion\nand a veridical snake perception. Similarly, dreams are the\n\u201cperceptions\u201d of a dreamer but do not touch reality. (Our world is a\ndream, say Buddhists, and we should try to become buddha,\n\u201cAwakened.\u201d)\n\nOne way to resist the pull of the illusion argument belongs to\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nwhich insists that not only is perception invariably veridical but also\ncognition in general, j\u00f1\u0101na. Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers hold in contrast that illusion is a false cognition. Rich\ndebate occurs over Ny\u0101ya\u2019s \u201cmisplacement\u201d view of illusion and a\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara \u201cno-illusion\u201d or \u201comission\u201d theory (illusion is a\nfailure to cognize of a certain sort, an absence of cognition, for\nexample, an absence of cognition of the difference between a\nremembering of silver and a perceiving of mother-of-pearl when holding\nin hand a piece of shell S exclaims, \u201cSilver!\u201d). Here Ny\u0101ya agrees\nwith the subjectivists: sometimes a person S apparently perceives\na to be F\u2014has an apparently perceptual cognition embedding\nFa\u2014when a is not in fact F, while S cannot discern\nfrom her own first-person perspective that the cognition is\nnon-veridical. Nevertheless, the predication content, according to\nNy\u0101ya as also M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nthe presentation or indication of F-hood, originates in things\u2019 really\nbeing F, through previous veridical experience of F-hood.\n\nHere we touch the heart of classical Indian realism. Snakehood is\navailable to become illusory predication content through previous\nveridical experience of snakes. It gets fused into a current perception\nby means of a foul-up in the normal causal process through the arousing\nof a snakehood memory-disposition\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) formed by previous\nexperience. The content or intentionality\n(vi\u1e63ayat\u0101, \u201cobjecthood\u201d) of an\nillusion is to be explained causally as generated by real features of\nreal things just as is genuine perception though they are distinct\ncognitive types. Illusion involves the projection into current\n(determinate) cognition (which would be pseudo-perception) of\npredication content preserved in memory. Sometimes the fusion of an\nelement preserved in memory is cross-sensory, tasting sourness, for\ninstance, when perceiving a lemon by sight or smelling a piece of\nsandalwood which is seen at too far a distance for actual olfactory\nstimulation. These are cases of veridical perception with an obvious\nadmixture or tinge of memory. Illusion, according to Ny\u0101ya, is to\nbe analyzed similarly, but unlike veridical cases of projection\nillusion involves taking something to be what it is not, a seeing or\nperceiving it through a \u201cmisplaced\u201d qualifier. This means that\nconcept-laden perception is necessarily combinational\u2014a position taken\nby Gautama himself, the \u201cs\u016btra-maker,\u201d and much elaborated\nby V\u0101tsy\u0101yana and the other commentators in text apparently\naimed at an early form of Buddhist subjectivism\n(Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 4.2.26\u201336). The upshot of these\ns\u016btras is that, first, the concept of illusion is\nparasitic on that of veridical experience (not all coins can be\ncounterfeit), and, second, that illusion shows a combinational\n(propositional) structure: this is a something or other. According to\nNy\u0101ya, perceptual illusion is right in part, that there is\nsomething there, but wrong about what it is. Ontologically, Ny\u0101ya takes a disjunctivist position: an illusion is a different kind of critter than a genuine perception, since its intentionality is different.\n\n\nTo fill out the realist account in late Ny\u0101ya, thought-laden\nperception, determinate perception, gets its content or intentionality\u2014its \u201cobject-directedness\u201d\u2014not only from the\nobject in connection with the sense organ but also from the\nclassificational power of the mind (or self). With the perceptual\ncognition, \u201cThat\u2019s a pot,\u201d for instance, the pot as an individual in\nconnection with a sensory faculty is responsible for the awareness of a\nproperty-bearer, for what is called the qualificandum portion of the\nperception, without admixture of memory. But the sensory connection is\nnot by itself responsible for the qualifier portion, the pothood, that\nis to say, the thing\u2019s classification as a pot. A qualificandum as\nqualified by a qualifier is perceived all at once\n(eka-v\u1e5btti-vedya), but a determinate\nperception\u2019s portions have distinct etiologies. Now the\nclassificational power of the mind (or self) is not innate, as pointed\nout, but is rather the product of presentational experience\n(anubhava) over the course of a subject\u2019s life. Repeatable\nfeatures of reality get impressed on the mind (or self) in the form of\nmemory dispositions. For most adults, prior determinate cognition\nis partly responsible for the content predicable of a particular, or a group of things,\npresented through the senses. That is, in perceiving a as an\nF, an F-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra formed by previous\nknowledge-source-produced bits of occurrent cognition of things F would\nbe a causal factor. The perception\u2019s own content includes the\nrepeatable nature of the qualifier through the operation of this\nfactor. We see the tree as a tree.\n\nBut sometimes neither a prior determinate cognition nor a memory\ndisposition is at all responsible for the predication content, for example, when a\nchild sees a cow for the very first time. Rather, an \u201cin the raw\u201d\nperceptual grasping of the qualifier (cowhood) delivers it to an\nensuing concept-laden and verbalizable perception. In other words,\nthere are cases of determinate cognition where\nindeterminate, concept-free perception furnishes the qualifier independently and the\nensuing concept-laden perception is not tinged by memory. Normally,\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, \u201cmemory-dispositions,\u201d do\nplay a causal role in determinate perception, according to Ny\u0101ya\nand M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and indeed\nepistemologists of all flags. But sometimes an immediately prior\nconcept-free perception of a qualifier plays the role of the\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra, furnishing by itself the concept, the\npredication content, the qualifier portion of an ensuing determinate,\nproposition-laden perception, which is the type of cognition that\nfounds our beliefs about the world.\n\nIf this were not an \u201cimmaculate perception\u201d but itself a grasping of a\nproperty through the grasping of another property, we would be faced\nwith an infinite regress and direct perception of the world would be\nimpossible. Concept-free perception need not provide the classifying not\nonly with second and third-time perceptions of something as F but not\neven, strictly speaking, with a first-time perception, since there\ncould be an intervening cognitive factor (provided, say, by analogy:\nsee below). But with that factor again the question would arise how it\ngets its content, and so since an indeterminate perception has to be\nposited at some point to block a regress it might as well be at the\nstart. This is the main argument of\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, the late Ny\u0101ya\nsystematizer, in defense of positing the concept-free as a type or\nfirst stage of perception (Phillips 2001).\n\nNevertheless, for all intents and purposes, perception embodies\nbeliefs, according to the realists. More accurately, a perceptual\nbelief is the result of the operation of perception as a knowledge\nsource. Everything that is nameable is knowable and vice-versa. There\nis nothing that when we attend to it cannot bear a name, for we can\nmake up new names. We can in principle verbalize the indications of our\nexperience, though many of them are not named since we are indifferent\n(pebbles perceived along the road). Concept-free perception is the\nclassical Indian realist rendering of our ability to form perceptual\nconcepts by attending to perception\u2019s phenomenological side.\nEpistemologically, it plays no role, since it is itself a posit and is\nunverbalizable and not directly apperceived (A. Chakrabarti 2000 gives\nthis and other reasons for jettisoning the concept from Ny\u0101ya\u2019s\nown realist point of view).\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra takes issue with the realist theory\nof perception, viewing all perception as concept-free. What is\nperceived is only the unqualified particular,\nsva-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a. The\nrealists\u2019 \u201cqualifiers\u201d such as cowhood are mental constructions,\n\u201cconvenient fictions.\u201d Various reductio arguments are put forth to show\nthe incoherence of the realists\u2019 conception of a qualificandum\nperceived at once to be qualified by a qualifier\n(eka-v\u1e5btti-vedya). The different views of\nthe objects of perception feed different views of inference.\n",
