    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || T. H. Green\n3.5 T. H. Green\n\nT. H. Green (1836\u20131882) began as a student and teacher of\nclassics before turning to philosophy. He knew Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s Greek texts well. In developing his view of a\nperson\u2019s good in Book III of his Prolegomena to Ethics,\nGreen finds his own views anticipated in Plato and Aristotle and\nespecially in Aristotle\u2019s treatment of happiness, the human\ngood, and the particular virtues. Green aims to show that a\nperson\u2019s good consists in his \u201cself-satisfaction\u201d or\n\u201cself-realization.\u201d To realize the self requires that one\nfully develop his capacities as a rational agent. And that requires\naiming at the good of others for their own sake. Green thought\nAristotle was right about the nature of the virtuous person\u2019s\nmotive. In Prolegomena 263 he notes Aristotle\u2019s view\nthat the virtuous person acts tou kalou heneka (for the sake\nof the fine), and he recognizes that acting in this way requires that\nthe agent have concern for the good of the community. So the\nagent\u2019s good is connected to the good of others. \n\nTo illustrate his reading of Aristotle, Green discusses two of\nAristotle\u2019s virtues: courage and temperance. He notes that both\nvirtues appear to be more restricted in scope than commonsense would\nsuggest. In discussing courage, Aristotle limits courage to facing\nfear in danger of death in defense of one\u2019s city\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1115a25\u201329). A man who faces death\nby drowning or disease is not courageous. Courage is restricted to\nfacing death in battle for one\u2019s city because such action aims\nat the common good and is the finest form of death. Green uses these\npoints in Aristotle\u2019s discussion to show that Aristotle\u2019s\nview rests on a general principle that can widen the circumstances of\ncourage in a way that Green accepts. In Green\u2019s view, courage is\na matter of facing the danger of death \u201cin the service of the\nhighest public cause which the agent can conceive\u201d (1969, 260).\n\n\nGreen explains Aristotle\u2019s restrictions on temperance in a\nsimilar way. Not every form of restraint counts as temperance for\nAristotle. It is limited to restraint of the pleasures of appetitive\ndesires for food, drink, and sex, the pleasures we share with\nnon-human animals. The intemperate person is like the gourmand who\nprayed that his throat might become longer than a crane\u2019s: he is\ninterested in sensation and does not value the exercise of his\nrational capacities. Green recognizes that Aristotle needs to check\nthese appetitive desires because intemperance is a danger to the\ncommon good. He writes: \u201csuch a check should be kept on the\nlusts of the flesh as might prevent them from issuing in what a Greek\nknew as hubris \u2013 a kind of self-assertion and\naggression upon the rights of others \u2026 which was looked upon as\nthe antithesis of the civil spirit\u201d (1969, 263). \n\nGreen was right to find his views anticipated in the Greeks. He saw,\nas Aristotle did, that living well requires the exercise of\none\u2019s developed rational powers, and that persons who have\nrealized their powers and have formed virtuous traits of character aim\nat the common good, which is a part of their own good. Like Aristotle,\nGreen thought that such development required that one be a participant\nin a special kind of political community \u2013 one \u201cwhere the\nfree combination of mutually respecting citizens\u201d enact equal\nlaw and the common good (1969, 263). \n\nFor further discussion of Green\u2019s interpretation and use of\nAristotle\u2019s views, see Irwin (2009).\n",
