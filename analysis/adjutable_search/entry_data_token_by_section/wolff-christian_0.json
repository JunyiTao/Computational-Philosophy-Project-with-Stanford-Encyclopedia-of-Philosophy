    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nChristian Wolff was born 24 January 1679 in Breslau in the province of\nSilesia (now part of Poland) to parents of modest\n means.[1]\n Wolff was educated at the Lutheran-humanist\nMaria-Magdelena-Gymansium, where his teachers included Christian\nGryphius (1649\u20131706), a baroque poet and dramatist, and Caspar\nNeumann (1648\u20131715), the latter of whom Wolff credited with\nintroducing him to the Cartesian philosophy. In 1699, Wolff enrolled\nat the University of Jena, where he pursued a course of study in\ntheology, physics, and mathematics, moving from there to Leipzig in\n1702 where he would sit the Magisterexamen and then complete\nhis Habilitationsschrift in 1703 entitled: Philosophia\npractica universalis, methodo mathematica conscripta (On\nUniversal Practical Philosophy, composed according to the Mathematical\nMethod). Otto Mencke (1644\u20131707), the founder of the learned\njournal Acta eruditorum, served as an examiner for the\ndissertation and, impressed, sent it to Leibniz, with whom Wolff\nsubsequently struck up a correspondence that continued until Leibniz\u2019s death in 1716.\n\nDue in part to Leibniz\u2019s support, Wolff was soon offered, and\naccepted, a position in Giessen (though he had also been offered\npositions at Danzig and Wismar) which he intended to take up after\nvisiting his family in Breslau. However, on his homeward journey the\noccupation of Saxony by Charles XII of Sweden required Wolff to take a\ndetour through nearby Halle in Prussia, whose recently founded\nuniversity also happened to be in need of a professor of mathematics.\nWolff was offered the position and, again with Leibniz\u2019s\nassistance, was able to extricate himself from his commitment to\nGiessen, delivering his inaugural lecture at Halle in early 1707.\nDuring the next 15 years he enjoyed a prolific period, publishing and\nlecturing at first primarily in mathematics and natural science,\nthough he began to lecture in philosophy proper around\n 1710.[2]\n Wolff\u2019s first major philosophical textbook was published in\n1713, the Vern\u00fcnfftige Gedancken von den Kr\u00e4fften des\nmenschlichen Verstandes und ihrem richtigen Gebrauche in\nErk\u00e4ntnis der Wahrheit (Rational Thoughts on the Powers of\nthe Human Understanding and its Propert Use in the Cognition of Truth)\n[the German Logic, hereafter GL]. In 1720, Wolff published\nhis German textbook on metaphysics, the Vern\u00fcnftige Gedanken\nvon Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen Dingen\n\u00fcberhaupt (Rational Thoughts on God, the World and the Soul\nof Man, and on All Things in General) [the German\nMetaphysics, hereafter GM]. These were followed by further German\ntextbooks on ethics (1720), politics (1721), and physics (1723).\n\nWolff\u2019s expanding philosophical activity, especially concerning\ntopics in natural theology, as well as his popularity as a lecturer\nand growing influence within the university drew the ire of his\nPietist colleagues in the faculty of theology, including August\nHermann Francke (1663\u20131723), the founder of the famous\nWaisenhaus (orphanage), and Joachim Lange (1670\u20131744).\nThey took exception to a number of doctrines expressed in\nWolff\u2019s German Metaphysics, including its privileging\nof the intellect to the will, its apparent demotion of freedom to mere\nspontaneity, and the diminished role played by revelation in matters\nof theological interest. While the Pietists were at first content to\nwage a behind-the-scenes campaign, Wolff\u2019s address as outgoing\nrector of the university on 12 July 1721, in which he defended the\nreasonableness of Confucian moral philosophy, led to a significant\nescalation of the dispute. Wolff, asserting the independence of the\nphilosophical faculty, refused to submit the text of his lecture for\nsubsequent examination by the faculty of theology, a conflict that\ncame to involve the university senate and even king Frederick Wilhelm\nI (the \u201csoldier king\u201d) himself. While Wolff enjoyed the\nsupport of officials within the royal court, the Pietists exploited\ntheir personal connections with the king, who was ultimately persuaded\nthat Wolff\u2019s endorsement of the pre-established harmony\nrepresented a threat to military discipline (as the acts of deserters\nwould be pre-established and so not subject to sanction). On 8\nNovember 1723, the king issued an edict removing Wolff from his\nuniversity position and ordering him to leave Prussia within 48 hours\non pain of hanging. The edict was received in Halle four days later,\nand Wolff immediately left Prussian lands on 12 November 1723.\n\nWhile Wolff\u2019s Pietist colleagues celebrated Wolff\u2019s exile\n(reportedly even from the pulpit), it ultimately served only to\nenhance Wolff\u2019s reputation, bringing him to the attention of\nluminaries of the Enlightenment, including Voltaire. He was\nimmediately offered positions in Leipzig and Marburg, the latter of\nwhich he accepted though a special exemption had to be granted to\nallow a Lutheran to teach at a Reformed university. And even as the\ndispute with his critics continued, generating a substantial\nliterature in its own right, Wolff managed during his Marburg years to\ncomplete a reworked Latin presentation of his theoretical philosophy\nintended to make his ideas available to a pan-European audience. These\ntexts include: Philosophia rationalis sive Logica\n(Rational Philosophy, or Logic) of 1728 [the Latin\nLogic, hereafter LL], the first part of which is the\nDiscursus praeliminaris de philosophia in genere\n(Preliminary Discourse on Philosophy in General) [DP]; the\nPhilosophia prima sive Ontologia (First Philosophy, or\nOntology) of 1730 [Ont.]; Cosmologia generalis\n(General Cosmology) of 1731 [Cosm.]; Psychologia\nempirica (Empirical Psychology) of 1732 [EP]; the\nPsychologia rationalis (Rational Psychology) of 1734\n[RP]; and the two-volume Theologia naturalis (Natural\nTheology) of 1736\u201337 [NT].\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I eventually thought better of his precipitous\naction against Wolff, as he attempted in 1733 to entice him\n(unsuccessfully) back to Halle and in 1736 lifted a prohibition he had\nenacted against the teaching of Wolffian texts. However, Wolff\nremained in Marburg, collecting tributes and memberships in learned\nsocieties, until the ascension of Friedrich Wilhelm I\u2019s son,\nFriedrich II (the Great), himself an enlightened monarch and admirer\nof Wolff. Wolff accepted the new king\u2019s offer of a\nprofessorship and vice-chancellorship at his previous institution in\nHalle and returned to the city on 6 December 1740 to take up his new\nposition. Wolff continued to lecture and publish actively, with his\nlater efforts devoted particularly to works on the law of peoples,\nnatural law, and ethics. He died in Halle on 9 April 1754.\n",
