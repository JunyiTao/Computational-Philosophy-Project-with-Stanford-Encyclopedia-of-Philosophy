    "main_text": "\n\nWe can think of belief as an all-or-nothing affair. For example, I\nbelieve that I am alive, and I don\u2019t believe that I am a\nhistorian of the Mongol Empire. However, often we want to make\ndistinctions between how strongly we believe or disbelieve\nsomething. I strongly believe that I am alive, am fairly confident\nthat I will stay alive until my next conference presentation, less\nconfident that the presentation will go well, and strongly disbelieve\nthat its topic will concern the rise and fall of the Mongol Empire.\nThe idea that beliefs can come in different strengths is a central\nidea behind Bayesian epistemology. Such strengths are called\ndegrees of belief, or credences. Bayesian\nepistemologists study norms governing degrees of beliefs, including\nhow one\u2019s degrees of belief ought to change in response to a\nvarying body of evidence. Bayesian epistemology has a long history.\nSome of its core ideas can be identified in Bayes\u2019 (1763)\nseminal paper in statistics (Earman 1992: ch. 1), with applications\nthat are now very influential in many areas of philosophy and of\nscience.\n\nThe present entry focuses on the more traditional, general issues\nabout Bayesian epistemology, and, along the way, interested readers\nwill be referred to entries that discuss the more specific topics. A\ntutorial on Bayesian epistemology will be provided in the first\nsection for beginners and those who want a quick overview.\n",
