    "main_text": "Tackling the First Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma || Synthetic a priori\n3.1 Synthetic a priori\n\nAs we have seen in\n section 1,\n Hume takes demonstrative arguments to have conclusions which are\n\u201crelations of ideas\u201d, whereas \u201cprobable\u201d or\n\u201cmoral\u201d arguments have conclusions which are\n\u201cmatters of fact\u201d. Hume\u2019s distinction between\n\u201crelations of ideas\u201d and \u201cmatters of fact\u201d\nanticipates the distinction drawn by Kant between\n\u201canalytic\u201d and \u201csynthetic\u201d propositions (Kant\n1781). A classic example of an analytic proposition is\n\u201cBachelors are unmarried men\u201d, and a synthetic proposition\nis \u201cMy bike tyre is flat\u201d. For Hume, demonstrative\narguments, which are based on a priori reasoning, can\nestablish only relations of ideas, or analytic propositions. The\nassociation between a prioricity and analyticity underpins\n premise P3,\n which states that a demonstrative argument establishes a conclusion\nwhose negation is a contradiction.\n\nOne possible response to Hume\u2019s problem is to deny\n premise P3,\n by allowing the possibility that a priori reasoning could\ngive rise to synthetic propositions. Kant famously argued in response\nto Hume that such synthetic a priori knowledge is possible\n(Kant 1781, 1783). He does this by a kind of reversal of the\nempiricist programme espoused by Hume. Whereas Hume tried to\nunderstand how the concept of a causal or necessary connection could\nbe based on experience, Kant argued instead that experience only comes\nabout through the concepts or \u201ccategories\u201d of the\nunderstanding. On his view, one can gain a priori knowledge\nof these concepts, including the concept of causation, by a\ntranscendental argument concerning the necessary preconditions of\nexperience. A more detailed account of Kant\u2019s response to Hume\ncan be found in de Pierris and Friedman 2013.\n",
