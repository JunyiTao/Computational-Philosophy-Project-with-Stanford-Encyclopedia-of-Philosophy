    "main_text": "Moral Disagreement and the Semantics (and Metasemantics) of Moral Language || New Wave Moral Realism\n5.2 New Wave Moral Realism\n\n\nThat strategy has been pursued by Richard Boyd in defense of his\nnaturalist form of moral realism, which is sometimes referred to as\n\u201cnew wave moral realism\u201d (Boyd 1988, but see also Brink\n1989). Boyd appeals to a causal theory of reference. His version of\nthat approach is complex and differs in significant ways from more\nfamiliar versions (such as those offered in Putnam 1972 and Kripke\n1980). But the main idea is that moral terms refer to the properties\nthat \u201ccausally regulate\u201d our uses of those terms, including\nour dispositions to apply them in particular cases. Such regulation\npresupposes that there are mechanisms which causally connect\n(instantiations of) the properties with the uses. Boyd insists that\nthose mechanisms must ensure some tendency to apply the term\nreliably to actions, persons or states of affairs which have the\nproperties in question, to secure a degree of epistemic access to them.\nHowever, he also stresses that this constraint does not preclude\nserious errors. Our use of \u201cgood\u201d can be relevantly\nregulated by a certain property even if we are ignorant of it and even\nif our ignorance results in many affirmations which are false (given\nthat the term refers to the property in question). Differences in our\nuse of moral terms and sentences of the kind that Hare highlighted are\ntherefore consistent with co-reference and accordingly also with\nthinking that there is a shared (factual) subject matter over which the\npeople in his scenario express conflicting beliefs by using the\npertinent terms and sentences.\n\n\nHowever, although mere differences in application do not undermine\nco-reference on Boyd\u2019s account, other factors do. That is the\npoint of departure of a criticism which Terrence Horgan and Mark\nTimmons have developed in a series of influential papers (first set out\nin Horgan and Timmons 1991 and 1992), in which they argue that\nBoyd\u2019s causal approach also commits realists to implications of\nthe type Hare pointed to.\n\n\nThe argument is illustrated by the \u201cMoral Twin Earth\u201d\nthought experiment. Moral Twin Earth is a planet whose inhabitants\nspeak a language which is similar to ours in that it includes the moral\nterms \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\nso on. Moreover, the social and psychological roles those terms play in\ntheir communities overlap with those they play in our communities. We\nmay imagine, for example, that they figure in similar ways in their\ndeliberations and discussions about how to act, and that the\ninhabitants are, like us, in general motivated to act and avoid acting\nin ways they classify as \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d,\nrespectively. A further stipulation\u2014a crucial one in this\ncontext\u2014is that the inhabitants\u2019 uses of the pertinent\nterms are causally regulated by different properties than those that\nregulate our uses of them. Thus, their use of \u201cright\u201d is\nregulated by the property actions have by satisfying certain\ndeontological requirements, while ours is regulated by the\nconsequentialist property actions have when maximizing happiness. Given\nthat stipulation, \u201cright\u201d does not, on Boyd\u2019s\naccount, refer to the same property for us and for them. So, again, the\ndisputes we might have with them about how to apply \u201cright\u201d\nneed not reflect any conflicts of belief. What Horgan and Timmons\nsuggest, however, in a way which mirrors Hare\u2019s argumentation, is\nthat it would still be plausible to construe our disputes with them\nregarding how to apply it as genuine moral disagreements, in virtue of\nthe overlap in social and psychological roles (for a different critique\nof Boyd\u2019s approach, see Schroeter and Schroeter 2013).\n",
