Pragmatic Arguments and Meaning in Life\n\n\nA popular pragmatic argument in support of theistic belief is built\nupon a saying erroneously attributed to Pascal that humans have a\ngod-shaped hole in their hearts that can be filled only by committing\nto God. Any finite filler will prove futile, pernicious or hollow.\nWhile Pascal nowhere mentions a god-shaped hole, in fragment 148 of the\nPens\u00e9es, he argues that,\n\n\nAll men seek happiness. There are no exceptions. \n\u2026 Yet for very many years no one without faith has ever\nreached the goal at which everyone is continually aiming. \n\u2026 A test which has gone on so long, without pause or change,\nreally ought to convince us that we are incapable of attaining the good\nby own efforts.\n\n\n\u2026 What else does this craving, and this helplessness,\nproclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all\nthat now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to\nfill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there\nthe help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since\nthis infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable\nobject; in other words by God himself. (Pascal)\n\n\n\nThe argument suggested in fragment #148 is that faith in God alone\nprovides happiness, as theistic commitment alone results in happiness;\nwhile all other causes and commitments are chimera too small to fill\nthe hole in our lives. While Pascal wrote of happiness, his argument\nmight be re-focused toward meaning in life, perhaps by arguing that a\ngenuinely or truly happy life will be a meaningful life. Would the\nexistence of God make our lives meaningful? In this context\n\u201cmeaning in life\u201d is a life that makes a positive objective\ndifference in the world. As we have seen, a pragmatic argument in\nsupport of doing a particular action conforms to the general scheme\nthat:\n\nDoing \u03b1 brings about, or contributes in bringing about,\n\u03b2, and\nIt is in your interest that \u03b2 obtain. So,\nYou have reason to do \u03b1.\n\n\n\nSome have contended that inculcating a theistic commitment plays a\nvital role in bringing about meaning in one\u2019s life, whether as a\nsufficient condition or as an enhancement (for discussion see Metz,\n2019, and see Mawson, 2019). The view that a theistic commitment is\nrequired for meaning in life is voiced by W.L. Craig with his claim\nthat:\n\n\nIf God does not exist, then both man and the universe are inevitably\ndoomed to death. Man, like all biological organisms, must die. With no\nhope of immortality, man\u2019s life leads only to the grave. His life\nis but a spark in the infinite darkness, a spark that appears,\nflickers, and dies forever\u2026 If God exists, then\nthere is hope for man. But if God does not exist, then all we are left\nwith is despair. \u2026if God does not exist, then life\nis objectively meaningless; but man cannot live consistently and\nhappily knowing that life is meaningless\u2026 If God does not\nexist, then life is futile. If the God of the Bible does exist, then\nlife is meaningful. Only the second of these two alternatives enables\nus to live happily and consistently. Therefore, it seems to me that\neven if the evidence for these two options were absolutely equal, a\nrational person ought to choose biblical Christianity. It seems to me\npositively irrational to prefer death, futility, and destruction to\nlife, meaningfulness, and happiness. As Pascal said, we have nothing to\nlose and infinity to gain. (Craig 2013)\n\n\nAn argument hinted at in the passage above might be reconstructed\nas:\n\nA human life has objective meaning only if that life is\nunending. And,\nAn unending human life \u2013 immortality \u2013 is meaningful\nonly if God provides a purpose or point to that life. And,\nImmortality would not be surprising if God exists. So,\nHuman life has objective meaning only if God exists. And,\nThere are no dispositive reasons to deny Theism. And,\nThe value associated with one\u2019s life being meaningful is\nvery great. So,\nOne has pragmatic reason to cultivate a theistic commitment.\n\n\n\nThis argument rests on several controversial assumptions. For\none, the argument assumes that a divine conferral of purpose is\nnecessary for one\u2019s life to have meaning and purpose. Presumably,\nthe idea is that a self-conferral of purpose would be arbitrary and\nlimited by human ignorance or uncertainty as to what is genuinely\nworthwhile. A conferral by God, however, would not be arbitrary as God\nwould confer only a purpose that is objectively worthwhile. Another\nassumption is that objective meaning in life requires immorality. One\nmight respond that this assumption neglects that increasing the balance\nof objective value (good) to disvalue (evil) can make a real difference\nin the world, even if one lacks immortality. The actions of Lincoln\nmade the world better than it would have been absent those actions.\nArguably, then, Lincoln\u2019s life had meaning. More generally, the\nachievement of good works, or the mitigation of suffering and pain,\nmight be ways that an objective positive difference results from\none\u2019s actions. Here is where the stipulation of immortality is\nsupposed to play a role \u2013 if one knows that one\u2019s\nachievements are like footprints on a beach, which the tides of time\nwill eventually sweep away, a sense of futility is, one might argue,\nunavoidable, whether we admit this or not. Immortality is supposed to\nensure, along with the divine conferral of purpose, a permanence which\nevades futility. Finally, note that premise (31) is particularly\ncontentious, as some would argue that the problem of evil, the problem\nof divine hiddenness, or the lack of evidence supporting Theism, for\nexamples, puts Theism beyond the rational pale.\n\n\nWhile Craig holds that God and immortality are required for meaning\nin life, one could argue that even if not strictly necessary,\nimmortality and God would enhance the value and meaning of one\u2019s\nlife and that prospective enhancement is reason sufficient to hope that\nGod exists and for human immortality. All else being equal, if\none\u2019s achievements were to have an eternal positive effect that\ndoes seem more valuable than if they had a limited effect. Is hope\nmotivated by pragmatic reasons a sufficient basis upon which to erect\nthe superstructure of theistic commitment? With this question, we\nare back to issues concerning the permissibility of hope. There are\nthose who argue that the existence of God would render the world\nworse-off than if God did not exist. That we should hope that this is\nnot a God created universe. For example, see Kahane 2011, and the last\nsection of this entry for a discussion.\n",
