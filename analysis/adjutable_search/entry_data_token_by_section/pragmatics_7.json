    "main_text": "Contemporary Pragmatic Theory || Border Disputes: Literalists, Minimalists, Contextualists and Others\n3.4 Border Disputes: Literalists, Minimalists, Contextualists and Others\n\nContemporary philosophical approaches to pragmatics are often\nclassified by their view of the two models discussed in\n Section 3.1.\n \u2018Literalists\u2019 think that semantics is basically\nautonomous, with little \u2018pragmatic intrusion\u2019;\n\u2018contextualists\u2019 adopt the basic outlines of the Relevance\nTheory view of the importance of pragmatics at every level, while\nperhaps demurring on many of the details and the psychological\norientation.\n\nTake, for example, an utterance of \u201cIt is raining\u201d by John\nnow on the CSLI patio in a telephone conversation with Kepa, who is in\nDonostia. John is talking about the weather in Stanford. Arguably,\nwhat John says is that it is raining in Stanford. This is\nwhat he intends for Kepa to understand, and it is the content of the\nbelief, formed by looking at the weather around him, that motivates\nhis utterance. Stanford, then, seems to be a constituent, part of the\nsubject matter, of John\u2019s remark. But how did it get there? It\nseems that it is a matter of pragmatics; it is a fact about\nJohn\u2019s intentions that makes his remark to be about Stanford,\nand that suffices. This is an example of what Perry (1986) calls an\n\u2018unarticulated constituent,\u2019 and an instance of a more\ngeneral phenomenon we will call \u2018unarticulated\ncontent.\u2019\n\nThe same basic choice, about what to do with apparently unarticulated\ncontent that seems to be part of what is said, presents itself in\nconnection with a number of other phenomena: \u2018enriched\u2019\nuses of logical operators and numerals (\u201cMary got married and\n[then] had [exactly] three children\u201d),\nquantifier domain restriction (\u201cNobody [in the class]\nwas paying attention\u201d), comparative adjectives (\u201cJohn is\nshort [for a football player]\u201d), and a long list of\nphenomena reconsidered now as possibly being part of what is said, the\nexplicature or the content of the utterance, rather than part of what\nis implicated.\n\nMost contemporary theorists would acknowledge that in such cases one\nmight describe \u2018what is said\u2019 in terms of the\nunarticulated content: John said that it was raining at\nStanford; the speaker said that Mary got married and\nthen had children, and so forth. And there is general\nagreement that intuitions about \u2018what is said\u2019 cannot by\nthemselves carry much theoretical weight, and there is considerable\ndisagreement about theoretical interpretation of unarticulated\ncontent.\n\nLiteralists argue that the important divide, traditionally marked by\n\u2018what is said,\u2019 should be maintained, although marked by\nnew terminology. Cappelen and Lepore\u2019s (2005) term is\n\u2018semantic content.\u2019 On the near side of semantic content\nwill be only the factors acknowledged by Grice: conventional meaning\nof words and modes of composition; resolution of ambiguity (including,\nperhaps, issues of standards of precision and vagueness), and\nresolution of reference of indexicals, demonstratives and names. On\nthe far side are Gricean implicatures.\n\nAmong literalists, we may distinguish between minimalists and\n\u2018hidden indexical\u2019 theorists. Literalists, do not accept\nany pragmatically determined element in utterance content that is not\ntriggered by grammar, i.e., by a particular context-sensitive element\nin the sentence used. Minimalists try to keep context-sensitive\nexpressions to a minimum and hidden-indexicalists pose a\ncontext-sensitive expression whenever is needed. The latter admit the\n\u2018unarticulated\u2019 content into the proposition literally\nexpressed by the utterance, but hold that it is not\n\u2018really\u2019 unarticulated, since below the surface grammar,\nat some deeper level, say logical form, the sentence provide an\nindexical to be resolved pragmatically (Stanley 2000; Stanley and\nSzabo 2000).\n\nCappelen and Lepore are both literalists and minimalists. They use the\nterm \u2018semantic content\u2019 for propositions determined solely\nby conventions of meaning, precisification, disambiguation and\nreference fixing. They allow that semantic content, so conceived, is\noften not what ordinary speakers would identify as \u2018what is\nsaid\u2019; but they take what is said to be a pragmatic concept, and\nso do not see this as an objection to their scheme. The semantic\ncontent of John\u2019s utterance above, for example, is something\nlike the proposition \u201cRain is occurring,\u201d a relatively\ntrivial proposition, that will be true if it is raining anywhere on\nearth (or perhaps, anywhere in the universe). (See Cappelen and Lepore\n(2007) and Perry (2007).) The triviality of John\u2019s remark,\nliterally interpreted, sets Kepa on the search of some relevant\nproposition he may have meant to convey, and this proposition, that it\nis raining in Palo Alto, is what satisfies our intuitive concept of\n\u2018what is said.\u2019 But that shows only that \u2018what is\nsaid\u2019 is basically a pragmatic concept, that shouldn\u2019t be\nused to delineate true semantic content. We need to change the sign\nfrom \u2018what is said\u2019 to \u2018semantic content,\u2019\nrather than move the boundary to fit the sign. On the near side of\nsemantic content we find only conventional meaning, disambiguation,\nand resolution of reference and vagueness. On the far side we find\nimplicatures, that contribute not only what is suggested, conveyed,\nand the like, but even what is said, as ordinarily conceived.\n\nThose over on the Contextualist side, in contrast, see the level\ncorresponding to Grice\u2019s \u2018what is said\u2019 as\ndetermined not only by semantics, disambiguation and reference-fixing,\nbut also by a number of other pragmatic processes that\n\u2018intrude\u2019 on the near side and enrich semantic content.\nContextualists include relevance theorists and such philosophers as\nRecanati (2004), Travis (1997), Korta and Perry (2006a, 2006b, 2007a,\n2007b, 2008, 2011, 2013) and Neale (2004). Contemporary contextualists\ndo not insist on the term \u2018what is said,\u2019 but provide\nother criteria for the boundary between the proposition more or less\ndirectly expressed and implicatures. Recanati argues that this level\n\u2014 which he sometimes calls \u2018what is\nsaidmax\u2019 in contrast of the \u2018what is\nsaidmin\u2019 of minimalists \u2014 should\nconsist of a proposition that is consciously available to the speaker\nand the proposition he intends to express, and that any planned\nimplications should also be consciously accessible. Cappelen and\nLepore\u2019s proposition would not usually pass this test. In our\nexample, John would not be consciously aware of having expressed a\nproposition that would be true if it was raining on Venus, nor would\nhe at any remotely conscious level have planned for Kepa to reason\nfrom the triviality and irrelevance of the proposition that rain\noccurs to the one he meant to convey, that it rains at Stanford.\n\nIn Korta and Perry\u2019s \u2018Critical Pragmatics\u2019 (2008,\n2011, 2013), the concept of \u2018what is said\u2019 is replaced\nwith two concepts. The \u2018reflexive\u2019 or\n\u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 and the\n\u2018referential\u2019 or \u2018locutionary content\u2019 of an\nutterance. The \u2018utterance-bound content\u2019 is its\ntruth-conditions, as determined by the conventional meanings of the\nwords used and modes of composition, and thus corresponds to the\n\u2018semantically determined content.\u2019 This content will not\nbe the proposition expressed, but rather a set of conditions on the\nutterance and the proposition it expresses, with quantification over\nall relevant factors not determined by meaning \u2014 including\nfactors that resolve ambiguity and reference. At this level, then,\nCritical Pragmatics is radically minimal. For example, an utterance\nu of \u201cElwood touched that woman\u201d will be true\n(roughly) if and only if there is an x and y such\nthat the speaker of u refers to x with\n\u2018Elwood,\u2019 refers to y with \u2018that\nwoman,\u2019 and uses \u2018touches\u2019 with for some action A\npermitted by the conventions of English, and at some time prior to the\ntime of u, x A\u2019ed y. The condition on the utterance\ngiven to the right of the \u2018if and only if\u2019 comprise the\nreflexive content of the utterance. On the other hand, the referential\ncontent of u will be the proposition that, say, Elwood put\nhis hands on Eloise, if the actual facts about u provide\nElwood, Eloise as the referents and putting one\u2019s hands on as\nthe relevant sense of \u2018touches.\u2019 Critical Pragmatics\nemphasizes the speaker\u2019s plan, a hierarchy of intentions, as the\nmain source of the facts that supplement conventional meaning to get\nus from reflexive to incremental meaning.\n\nThe second concept employed to do the traditional work of \u2018what\nis said\u2019 is \u2018locutionary content.\u2019 The\nintended locutionary content is basically the referential\ncontent the speaker intends to express, given her conception of the\ncontext \u2014 that is, roughly, the speaker, time, place and whom\nand what she points at. The locutionary content is fixed by the actual\ncontextual facts, so a speaker\u2019s intended locutionary content\nmay not be the locutionary content of the utterance she produces.\n\nAn intermediate position \u2014 called \u2018syncretic\u2019 by\nRecanati (2004) \u2014 has been subtly defended by Kent Bach (1994,\n1999a, 2001). Bach is on the literalist, minimalist side of the\nspectrum with respect to semantic content (for which he continues to\nuse the term \u2018what is said.\u2019) But he agrees with\ncontextualists that unarticulated contents are not implicatures, and\nare not triggered by the meaning of the sentence uttered. He\nintroduces an intermediate category between what is said, in his\nminimalist sense, and implicatures, which he calls\n\u2018implicitures\u2019 \u2014with \u2018ci\u2019 pronounced as\nin \u2018implicit\u2019 \u2014 to include these elements.\n",
