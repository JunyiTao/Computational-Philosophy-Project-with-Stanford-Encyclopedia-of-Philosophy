    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || Probability-raising and Conditional Probability\n2.1 Probability-raising and Conditional Probability\n\nThe central idea that causes raise the probability of their effects\ncan be expressed formally using conditional probability. C\nraises the probability of E just in case:\n\n\\((\\PR_1)\\)\n\\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(E)\\).\n\n\nIn words, the probability that E occurs, given that C\noccurs, is higher than the unconditional probability that E\noccurs. Alternately, we might say that C raises the probability\nof E just in case:\n\n\\((\\PR_2)\\)\n\\( \\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\);\n\n\nthe probability that E occurs, given that C occurs, is\nhigher than the probability that E occurs, given that C\ndoes not occur. These two formulations turn out to be equivalent in\nthe sense that inequality \\(\\PR_1\\) will hold just in case \\(\\PR_2\\)\nholds. Some authors (e.g., Reichenbach 1956, Suppes 1970, Cartwright\n1979) have formulated probabilistic theories of causation using\ninequalities like \\(\\PR_1\\), others (e.g., Skyrms 1980, Eells 1991)\nhave used inequalities like \\(\\PR_2\\). This difference is mostly\nimmaterial, but for consistency we will stick with (\\(\\PR_2)\\). Thus a\nfirst stab at a probabilistic theory of causation would be:\n\n(PR)\nC is a\ncause of E just in case \\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid\n{\\nsim}C)\\).\n\n\nPR has some advantages over the simplest version of a regularity\ntheory of causation (discussed in\n Section 1.1\n above). PR is compatible with imperfect regularities: C may\nraise the probability of E even though instances of C\nare not invariably followed by instances of E. Moreover, PR\naddresses the problem of relevance: if C is a cause of\nE, then C makes a difference for the probability of\nE. But as it stands, PR does not address either the problem of\nasymmetry, or the problem of spurious correlations. PR does not\naddress the problem of asymmetry because probability-raising turns out\nto be symmetric: \\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\),\nif and only if \\(\\PP(C \\mid E) \\gt \\PP(C \\mid {\\nsim}E)\\).\nThus PR by itself cannot determine whether C is the cause of\nE or vice versa. PR also has trouble with spurious\ncorrelations. If C and E are both caused by some\nthird factor, A, then it may be that \\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt\n\\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\) even though C does not cause\nE. This is the situation shown in\n Figure 1\n above. Here, C is the drop in the level of mercury in a\nbarometer, and E is the occurrence of a storm. Then we would\nexpect that \\(\\PP(E \\mid C) \\gt \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C)\\). In\nthis case, atmospheric pressure is referred to as a\nconfounding factor.\n",
