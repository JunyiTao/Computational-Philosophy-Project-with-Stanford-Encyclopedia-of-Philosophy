    "main_text": "Three Medieval Problems || The Soul and Immortality\n3.3 The Soul and Immortality\n\nPlato thought of human souls as distinct substances from their bodies,\ncapable of existing separately and being reincarnated. The late\nancient Platonists retained this dualism and aimed so far as possible\neven in their mortal lives to release their souls from their bodies\nand find union with the One. By contrast, for Aristotle the soul is\nthe form of a living body, that which accounts for its life functions,\njust as the form of a non-living thing\u2014the form of stoneness in\na stone\u2014accounts for its being the sort of thing it is. A plant,\nthen, grows and goes through its life cycle in virtue of its\nvegetative soul. A non-human animal\u2019s soul is not just\nvegetative but also sensitive: it accounts for the animal\u2019s\nability to move and to perceive with its senses. The human soul\naccounts for all these capabilities, and it also has intellect: it can\nthink intellectually about universals. If the soul is the form of a\nbody, survival independently of the body would seem impossible in\nprinciple. There are, however, passages in Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Soul (especially 430a [Chapter 5]) that suggest that the\nintellect is imperishable, but they probably are not intended to refer\nto individual human souls.\n\nBy contrast with both Plato and Aristotle, a core belief for Jews,\nChristians, and Muslims is in a bodily resurrection, which is linked\nto punishment for sins and reward for a good life. Christians also\ndeveloped the doctrine that, in the period between death and the Final\nJudgement, people\u2019s souls survive separately and can be\nrewarded, purged, or consigned to eternal punishment.\n\nAvicenna went against the Islamic doctrine of bodily resurrection and,\nreading Aristotle from a Platonist perspective, argued that each human\nhas an intellect which, unlike the other parts of the soul, is\nimmaterial\u2014if it were not immaterial, he argues, it could not\nperceive universals\u2014and, being immaterial, is immortal (see,\ne.g., the passage from The Salvation translated in Khalidi\n2005: 27\u201358). Averroes, too, was unwilling to accept bodily\nresurrection in any straightforward way, and, in face of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s criticisms of Avicenna in this regard, he\nfalls back on saying that philosophers uphold resurrection because\nthey hold that the masses should believe this widely-held religious\ndoctrine and so they do not contradict it publicly (Averroes\nIncoherence [1954: 359\u2013363]). Averroes does not,\nhowever, at all follow Avicenna\u2019s Platonizing interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s views about the soul: in his Great Commentary on\nOn the Soul, he argues that there is, indeed, an imperishable\nintellect, but it is an independently existing immaterial being. It\nneeds humans, however, for thinking to take place, since thinking\nrequires images, which humans process in their corporeal brains. Just\nas the book in front of me makes the visual perception I am having of\nit veridical, so the processed images in our brains of bodily things\nenable the one independent, immaterial intellect to think truly using\n universals.[31]\n\nMaimonides considered that the only genuine pleasures are intellectual\nones, and the type of bodily rewards that were often associated with\nthe Resurrection are not only without value, except as incentives for\nthose who lack wisdom, but also misleading, because we should act in\naccord with God\u2019s law for love of God, not from hope of reward\n(Commentary on Mishnah, Introduction to Sanhedrin\n[translated in \u201cMaimonides on the Jewish Creed\u201d, 1906]).\nHe none the less asserted the Resurrection as part of the Jewish\ncreed, and rejected criticisms that he had ever denied it. As in many\nplaces, his genuine position is open to interpretation.\n\nAvicenna\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle proved very attractive to\nthe earlier thirteenth-century Latin university thinkers, since it\nharmonized with Augustine\u2019s dualistic view of soul and body,\nwhich had predominated until On the Soul became known (see\nHasse 2000). Once it was understood properly, Averroes\u2019s theory\nwas recognized as clearly contrary to Christian teaching, since it\nexcluded individual immortality. But many Arts Masters from the 1260s\nthrough to the sixteenth century continued to champion it as the\ncorrect interpretation of Aristotle and the best theory so far as\nnatural reason is concerned, although wrong, because contradicted by\nrevealed truth. Aquinas, however, castigated Averroes\u2019s theory\nas a misunderstanding of Aristotle, and also as incoherent, since it\nmakes humans into the objects of thought rather than\n thinkers.[32]\n He also rejected Avicenna\u2019s dualist reading, insisting that\neach human has their own intellective soul, which is the form of their\nbody. He then explained the separate survival of the human soul by\narguing that its special activity, thinking intellectually, is one\nthat does not take place in a corporeal organ (as sight takes place in\nthe eyes), and so it is a subsisting thing, independent of the\n body.[33]\n\nThe fiercest medieval criticism of Aquinas\u2019s theory was in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul, published by Pietro\nPomponazzi in 1516. Pomponazzi begins by declaring that he accepts the\nimmortality of the human soul as a truth, known by revelation, and\nthat Aquinas\u2019s argument for its immortality is the best that can\nbe made. He opposes both Averroes\u2019s view and a Platonic dualism,\nwhich Ficino had quite recently revived. But he seems to have just as\nmany objections to Aquinas. In particular, he points out that,\naccording to Aristotle, although intellectual thinking is immaterial,\nit cannot take place without there going on at the same time a play of\nmental images, which are sensible things and require a bodily organ,\nthe brain. The human intellect is, therefore, dependent on the body,\nnot in the activity of thinking itself, but with respect to a\nnecessary condition for it. Some historians think that, given the\nstrength of his attack, and the fact that he goes on to explain why a\nrejection of the soul\u2019s immortality need not have bad moral\nconsequences, Pomponazzi did not really accept Christian teaching\nabout the afterlife. It is more plausible, however, that he\u2014like\nBoethius of Dacia in the thirteenth century\u2014was mainly concerned\nto protect the prerogative of Arts Masters to interpret Aristotle and\nwork within natural reason, even when that meant contradicting Church\ndoctrine.\n",
