    "main_text": "Concepts in Molecular Biology || Gene\n2.3 Gene\n\nThe question of whether classical, Mendelian genetics could be (or\nalready has been) reduced to molecular biology (to be taken up in\n Section 3.1\n below) motivated philosophers to consider the connectability of the\nterm they shared: the gene. Investigations of reduction and scientific\nchange raised the question of how the concept of the gene evolved over\ntime, figuring prominently in C. Kenneth Waters\u2019 (1990, 1994,\n2007, see entry on\n molecular genetics),\n Philip Kitcher\u2019s (1982, 1984) and Raphael Falk\u2019s (1986)\nwork. Over time, however, philosophical discussions of the gene\nconcept took on a life of their own, as philosophers raised questions\nindependent of the reduction debate: What is a gene? And, is there\nanything causally distinct about DNA? (see the entry on the\n gene)\n\nFalk (1986) explicitly asked philosophers and historians of biology,\n\u201cWhat is a Gene?\u201d Discoveries such as overlapping genes,\nsplit genes, and alternative splicing (discussed in\n Section 1.2)\n made it clear that simply equating a gene with an uninterrupted\nstretch of DNA would no longer capture the complicated\nmolecular-developmental details of mechanisms such as gene expression\n(Downes 2004; Luc-Germain, Ratti and Boem 2015). In an effort to\nanswer Falk\u2019s question, two general trends have emerged in the\nphilosophical literature: first, distinguish multiple gene concepts to\ncapture the complex structural and functional features separately, or\nsecond, rethink a unified gene concept to incorporate such complexity.\n(For a survey of gene concepts defended by philosophers, see Griffiths\nand Stotz 2007, 2013.; Rheinberger and Muller-Wille 2018)\n\nA paradigmatic example of the first line came from Lenny Moss\u2019s\ndistinction between Gene-P and Gene-D (Moss 2001, 2002). Gene-P\nembraced an instrumental preformationism (providing the\n\u201cP\u201d); it was defined by its relationship to a phenotype.\nIn contrast, Gene-D referred to a developmental resource (providing\nthe \u201cD\u201d); it was defined by its molecular sequence. An\nexample will help to distinguish the two: When one talked about the\ngene for cystic fibrosis, the most common genetic disease affecting\npopulations of Western European descent, the Gene-P concept was being\nutilized; the concept referred to the ability to track the\ntransmission of this gene from generation to generation as an\ninstrumental predictor of cystic fibrosis, without being contingent on\nknowing the causal pathway between the particular sequence of DNA and\nthe ultimate phenotypic disease. The Gene-D concept, in contrast,\nreferred instead to just one developmental resource (i.e., the\nmolecular sequence) involved in the complex development of the\ndisease, which interacted with a host of other such resources\n(proteins, RNA, a variety of enzymes, etc.); Gene-D was indeterminate\nwith regards to the ultimate phenotypic disease. Moreover, in cases of\nother diseases where there are different disease alleles at the same\nlocus, a Gene-D perspective would treat these alleles as individual\ngenes, while a Gene-P perspective treats them collectively as\n\u201cthe gene for\u201d the disease. (For other examples of\ngene-concept dividers, see Keller\u2019s distinction between the gene\nas a structural entity and the gene as a functional entity as well as\nBaetu\u2019s distinction between the gene as a syntax-based concept\nand the gene as a mapping concept (Baetu 2011; Keller 2000).)\n\nA second philosophical approach for conceptualizing the gene involved\nrethinking a single, unified gene concept that captured the\nmolecular-developmental complexities. For example, Eva Neumann-Held\n(Neumann-Held 1999, 2001; Griffiths and Neumann-Held 1999) claimed\nthat a \u201cprocess molecular gene concept\u201d (PMG) embraced the\ncomplicated developmental intricacies. On her unified view, the term\n\u201cgene\u201d referred to \u201cthe recurring process that leads\nto the temporally and spatially regulated expression of a particular\npolypeptide product\u201d (Neumann-Held 1999). Returning to the case\nof cystic fibrosis, a PMG for an individual without the disease\nreferred to one of a variety of transmembrane ion-channel templates\nalong with all the epigenetic factors, i.e., nongenetic influences on\ngene expression, involved in the generation of the normal polypeptide\nproduct. And so cystic fibrosis arose when a particular stretch of the\nDNA sequence was missing from this process. (For another example of a\ngene-concept unifier, see Falk\u2019s discussion of the gene as a DNA\nsequence that corresponded to a single norm of reaction for various\nmolecular products based on varying epigenetic conditions (Falk\n2001).)\n\nRelatedly, philosophers have also debated the causal distinctiveness\nof DNA. Consider again the case of cystic fibrosis. A stretch of DNA\non chromosome 7 is involved in the process of gene expression, which\ngenerates (or fails to generate) the functional product that\ntransports chloride ions. But obviously that final product results\nfrom that stretch of DNA as well as all the other developmental\nresources involved in gene expression, be it in the expression of the\nfunctional protein or the dysfunctional one. Thus, a number of authors\nhave argued for a causal parity thesis, wherein all developmental\nresources involved in the generation of a phenotype such as cystic\nfibrosis are treated as being on par (Griffiths and Knight 1998;\nRobert 2004; Stotz 2006).\n\nWaters (2007, see also his entry on\n molecular genetics),\n in reply, has argued that there is something causally distinctive\nabout DNA. Causes are often conceived of as being difference makers,\nin that a variable (i.e., an entity or activity in a mechanism) can be\ndeemed causal when a change in the value of that variable would\ncounterfactually have led to a different outcome (see the entry on\n scientific explanation).\n According to Waters, there are a number of potential\ndifference makers in the mechanisms involved in developing or not\ndeveloping cystic fibrosis; that is, an individual with two normal\ncopies of the gene could still display signs of cystic fibrosis if a\nmanipulation was done to the individual\u2019s RNA polymerase (the\nprotein responsible for transcribing DNA to RNA), thereby undermining\nthe functional reading of the stretch of DNA. So RNA polymerase is a\ndifference maker in the development or lack of development of cystic\nfibrosis, but only a potential difference maker, since variation in\nRNA polymerase does not play a role in the development or lack of\ndevelopment of cystic fibrosis in natural populations. The stretch of\nDNA on chromosome 7, however, is an actual difference maker.\nThat is, there are actual differences in natural human populations on\nthis stretch of DNA, which lead to actual differences in developing or\nnot developing cystic fibrosis; DNA is causally distinctive, according\nto Waters, because it is an actual difference maker. Advocates of the\nparity thesis are thus challenged to identify the other resources (in\naddition to DNA) that are actual difference makers.\n\nRecently, Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz (2013) have responded to\nthis challenge by offering examples in which, depending on context,\nregulatory mechanisms can either contribute additional information to\nthe gene products or create gene products for which there is no\nunderlying sequence. Thus, according to Griffiths and Stotz, to assign\na causally distinctive role to DNA, as Waters does, is to ignore key\naspects of how the gene makes its product.\n",
