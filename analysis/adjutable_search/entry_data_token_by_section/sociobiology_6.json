    "main_text": "Central criticisms of Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology || Behavioral vs. Psychological Focus\n4.3 Behavioral vs. Psychological Focus\n\nAnother problem for behavioral ecology and sociobiology is their focus\non trying to understand the biological basis of behavior as\nsuch. The behavioral focus made sense to those behavioral ecologists\ninfluenced by Lorenz and Tinbergen\u2019s ethology, but once\ncognitive psychologists became interested in applying evolutionary\nthinking to their work, the effects of the cognitive revolution in\npsychology began to have an effect on some of the\n\u201csociobiological\u201d thinkers, and they transformed\nsociobiology into evolutionary psychology (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987;\nTooby and Cosmides, 1990). The result of the cognitive revolution in\npsychology was that many psychologists came to regard the proper\ntarget of explanation in psychology to be genuinely psychological\nstates or mechanisms rather than behavioral dispositions (as in\nSkinnerian Behaviorism) (Chomsky, 1959). In cognitive science since\nthe middle of the twentieth century, psychological states and\nmechanisms have largely been understood in computational and\nmaterialist terms, that is, that the mind is the brain, and that brain\nstates and mechanisms are essentially computational states and\ncomputers respectively (though almost certainly not serial computers).\nPsychological descriptions, then, are simply descriptions of these\nbrain systems in computational or information-processing terms;\ngenerally they appeal to representations, decision rules and\nalgorithms that brain systems process. The shift in methodology and\ntheory represented by this change in approach was extremely\nsignificant. But it also appears to have made cognitive psychologists\ninterested in evolution averse to thinking of behavioral dispositions\nas proper targets of evolutionary explanation, just as they were\naverse to thinking of them as the proper targets of psychological\nexplanation (Cosmides and Tooby, 1987). This issue never seems to have\narisen for the human behavioral ecologists; indeed, not only is\nbehavior treated as the only proper target of evolutionary\nexplanation, but psychology is explicitly ignored in favor of behavior\nfor methodological reasons\u2014the focus on behavior is part of the\n\u201cphenotypic gambit\u201d (Grafen, 1984) which (as described\nabove) simplifies evolutionary modeling and the process of deriving\nexplanations from it in human behavioral ecology.\n\nThe importance of the issue to the evolutionary psychologists has led\nto a series of arguments traded between the human behavioral\necologists and evolutionary psychologists for preferring behavior over\npsychology and vice versa. Two main arguments have been raised in\nfavor of considering behavior the proper target of explanation, both\nfrom. The first is purely practical: behavior is relatively\nstraightforwardly observable whereas psychological mechanisms are not,\nto the extent that the nature of only a few psychological mechanisms\nhas been uncontroversially demonstrated (one of the few examples might\nbe the mechanisms for learning language) (Alexander, 1990). The second\nis that only behavior can be an adaptation because only behavior is\nthe actual causal nexus between the organism and its environment\n(Alexander, 1990; see the same idea in early form in Skinner,\n1984).\n\nThe central problem with both of these arguments is that, while they\nare true of overt behavior, they are not true of the behavioral\ndispositions or strategies (complex behavioral dispositions) which are\nthe actual targets of explanation in behavioral ecology\u2014or at\nleast, no more true than of psychological mechanisms. Behavioral\ndispositions do not causally interact with the environment except\ninsofar as they lead to the actual manifestation of overt behavior;\nthey are also no more \u201cstraightforwardly observable\u201d than\npsychological mechanisms since they cannot be observed until overt\nbehavior in manifested, and even then distinguishing between different\nstrategies with overlapping component behavioral dispositions is also\ndifficult.\n\nArguments for the claim that only psychological mechanisms should be\nconsidered to be adaptations rest on the idea that behavior is really\nonly ever a manifestation of the underlying psychology. Behavior is\nnot an adaptation so much as it is the effect of an adaptation.\nCosmides and Tooby (1987) also argue that the really interesting\nevolutionary generalizations emerge at the level of psychology, not\nbehavior. Again, however, this argument depends on understanding\n\u201cbehavior\u201d as \u201covert behavior\u201d, individual\nchunks of physical activity that are not necessarily reproduced over\ntime and which do not occur in evolutionary social science\ngeneralizations, verses understanding \u201cbehavior\u201d as\n\u201ccomplex behavioral strategies\u201d, which do seem potentially\ntransmissible (via the psychological mechanisms that support them). It\nis also notable that such strategies are the subject of a significant\nevolutionary literature\u2014such as evolutionary game theory, on\nwhich Cosmides and Tooby themselves depend: the argument for expecting\ntheir famous \u201cCheater Detection\u201d module (Cosmides, 1989;\nCosmides and Tooby, 1992) is derived from Axelrod and Hamilton (1981)\nand Trivers\u2019 (1971) work showing that TIT FOR TAT, which\nrequires its players to be able to detect cheaters on reciprocally\naltruistic interactions, is an evolutionary stable\n strategy[9].\n\nMore recently, philosophers have also presented some arguments for one\nside or the other of this issue. Buller (2005, 50\u201352), for\nexample, argues that behaviors cannot be adaptations because they are\nnot heritable, whereas psychological mechanisms are. However,\nBuller\u2019s discussion does not make the distinction between overt\nbehaviors and behavioral strategies described above. Buller argues\nthat behaviors could disappear from the population for generations if\nthe necessary response conditions never arose, but yet still emerge\nagain if the stimulus reappeared, and this suggests that these\nbehaviors are not inherited as such rather than the underlying\npsychological mechanism. In this he is right as long as he means the\novert behaviors; behavioral dispositions or strategies could also\nremain present and be inherited in the absence of the response\nconditions. Moreover, Buller\u2019s description of a\n\u201cpsychological mechanism\u201d in this context sounds rather\nlike a behavioral disposition (2005, 52\u201353).\n\nAnother argument in the philosophical literature for thinking that\nbehaviors are not the proper targets of natural selection explanations\nis that behaviors are not quasi-independent (Lewontin, 1978)\nin the way they need to be to evolve by selection in their own right\n(Sterelny, 1992; Sterelny and Fitness, 2003; Sterelny and Griffiths,\n1999). This is because many behavioral strategies will depend on\nmulti-purpose mechanisms that cannot change during evolution without\nthose changes ramifying to the other strategies those mechanisms\nproduce. However, Driscoll (2004) argues that this is not necessarily\nthe case; multi-purpose mechanisms, in order to be able to produce\nmore than one strategy, would have to have branching algorithms;\nvariation in any of these mechanisms necessary to generate variation\nin any one strategy need only occur on the branch relevant to the\nstrategy in question and need have little or no effect on the other\nbranches. Instead, whether an evolutionary explanation is properly\ndirected at the behavioral or psychological level depends on the\ncase.\n",
