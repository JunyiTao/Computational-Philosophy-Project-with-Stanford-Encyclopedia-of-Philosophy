    "main_text": "Philosophical Style\n2. Philosophical Style\n\nIn certain ways Herder\u2019s philosophical texts are easier to read\nthan others from the period. For example, he avoids technical jargon,\nwrites in a way that is lively and rich in examples rather than dry\nand abstract, and has no large, complex system for the reader to keep\ntrack of. But his texts also have certain peculiarities that can\nimpede a proper understanding and appreciation of his thought, and it\nis important to be alerted to these.\n\nTo begin with, Herder\u2019s writing often seems emotional and\ngrammatically undisciplined in ways that might perhaps be expected in\ncasual speech but not in philosophical texts. This is intentional.\nIndeed, Herder sometimes deliberately \u201croughed up\u201d\nmaterial in this direction between drafts. Moreover, he has serious\nphilosophical reasons for writing in such a way, including the\nfollowing: (1) This promises to make his writing more broadly\naccessible and interesting to people\u2014a decidedly non-trivial\ngoal for him, since he believes it to be an essential part of\nphilosophy\u2019s vocation to have a broad social impact. (2) He\nbelieves in the expressive superiority of speech over writing. (3) One\nof his central theses in the philosophy of mind holds that thought is\nnot and should not be separate from volition, or affect, that types of\nthinking that attempt to exclude affect are inherently distorting and\ninferior. Standard academic writing has this vice, whereas spontaneous\nspeech, and writing that imitates it, do not. (4) Herder is opposed to\nany lexical or grammatical straitjacketing of language, any slavish\nobedience to dictionaries and grammar books. In his view, such\nstraitjacketing is inimical, not only to linguistic creativity and\ninventiveness, but also (much worse), since thought is essentially\ndependent on and confined in its scope by language, thereby to\ncreativity and inventiveness in thought itself.\n\nAnother peculiarity of Herder\u2019s philosophical texts is their\nunsystematic nature. This is again deliberate. For Herder is\nlargely hostile toward systematicity in philosophy (a fact that is\nreflected both in explicit remarks and in many of his titles:\nFragments \u2026 , Ideas \u2026 , etc.). He is\nparticularly hostile to the ambitious sort of systematicity that is\naspired to in the tradition of Spinoza, Wolff, Kant, Fichte,\nSchelling, and Hegel: the ideal of a comprehensive theory whose parts\ndisplay some sort of strict overall pattern of derivation. He has\ncompelling reasons for this hostility: (1) He is very skeptical that\nsuch systematic designs can be made to work (as opposed to creating,\nthrough illicit means, an illusion that they do). (2) He\nbelieves that such system-building leads to a premature closure of\ninquiry, and in particular to a disregarding or distortion of new\nempirical evidence. Scrutiny of such systems amply bears out both of\nthese concerns. Herder\u2019s well-grounded hostility to this type of\nsystematicity established an important counter-tradition in German\nphilosophy (which subsequently included, for example, Friedrich\nSchlegel, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Adorno).\n\nOn the other hand, Herder is in favor of\n\u201csystematicity\u201d in a more modest sense: the ideal of a\ntheory that is self-consistent and supported by argument (this marks\nan important point of methodological contrast with Hamann, whom Herder\nalready criticizes for failing to provide arguments in an essay from\nearly 1765, Dithyrambic Rhapsody [G1:38]).\nHe by no means always achieves this ideal (so that interpreting him\ncalls for more selectivity and reconstruction than is the case with\nsome philosophers). However, his failures to do so are more often\napparent than real: First, in many cases where he may seem to be\nguilty of inconsistency he is really not. For he is sometimes\ndeveloping philosophical dialogues between two or more opposing\nviewpoints, in which cases it would clearly be a mistake to accuse him\nof inconsistency in any usual or pejorative sense. And (less\nobviously) in many other cases he is in effect still working in this\ndialogue-mode, only without bothering to distribute the positions\namong different interlocutors explicitly, and so is again innocent of\nreal inconsistency (examples of this occur in How Philosophy Can\nBecome and This Too a Philosophy of History). Moreover,\nhe has serious motives for using this method of (implicit) dialogue:\n(1) Sometimes his main motive is simply that when dealing with\nreligiously or politically delicate matters it permits him to state\nhis views but without quite stating them as his own and therefore\nwithout inviting trouble. But he also has philosophically deeper\nmotives: (2) He takes over from the pre-critical Kant an idea\n(inspired by ancient skepticism) that the best way for a philosopher\nto pursue the truth is by setting contrary views on a subject into\nopposition with one another in order to advance toward, and hopefully\nattain, the truth through their mutual testing and modification. (3)\nIn addition, he develops a more original variant of that idea on the\nsocio-historical plane: analogously, the way for humankind as a whole\nto attain the elusive goal of truth is through an ongoing contest\nbetween opposing positions, in the course of which the best ones will\neventually win out (this idea anticipates and indirectly influenced a\ncentral thesis of John Stuart Mill\u2019s On Liberty\n[1859]). This yields a further motive for the dialogue-method (even\nwhen it does not lead Herder himself to any definite conclusion), in\neffect warranting the rhetorical question, And what does it matter to\nthe cause of humankind and its discovery of truth whether those\nvarious opposing positions are advanced by different people or by\nthe same person? Second, Herder\u2019s frequent appearance\nof neglecting to give arguments is often, rather, a principled\nrejection of arguments of certain sorts. For example, he has\na general commitment to empiricism and against apriorism in philosophy\nthat usually leads him to avoid giving familiar sorts of a priori\narguments in philosophy; and a commitment to sentimentalism in ethics\nthat leads him to refrain from familiar sorts of cognitivist arguments\nin ethics.\n",
