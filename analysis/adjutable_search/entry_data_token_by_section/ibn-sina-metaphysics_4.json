    "main_text": "Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology || Univocacy of Being and Ontological Distinction\n2.4 Univocacy of Being and Ontological Distinction\n\nThe dual definition (and notion) of both being and metaphysics reveals\nthe nuanced univocacy or univocity that rules both Avicenna\u2019s\nontology and his theology. If the uncaused Principle is itself\npart of being, then It is the principle of only part\nof being: of being insofar as it is caused, and not of all being or of\nbeing as such. Indeed, if the Principle were the principle of all\nbeing, it would, paradoxically, be Its own principle (while the\n\u201cFirst\u201d can be defined only as the being that Itself has\nno principle at all; the whole as such has no principle:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 2, 14, 1\u201316,20). Insofar as It\nis existent, the Principle is thus existent just as the world is.\nHence the ontological distinction between the uncaused Principle and\nIts effect does not lie in existence as such, but in one of its modes:\nthe uncaused Principle is necessary as regards existence,\nwhile everything else is always possible as regards\nexistence: i.e., it exists insofar as it is necessitated and\ntherefore necessary by virtue of something other. As a consequence,\nthe existence of things that are in themselves possible is always\nconceived as related to a (possible) essence, while\nthe being of the Principle is purely and necessarily existence:\ndespite a certain unavoidable ambiguity in Avicenna\u2019s language\n(see e.g., Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 363, 1\u20132;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 5, 349, 11: \u201cthe reality of\nthe First\u201d), the Necessarily Existent has no essence or no\nquiddity that differs from existence (anniyya:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 4, 344, 10\u201311; 346,\n8\u201312; cf. Macierowski 1988) and is in that respect beyond\nessence. The first attribute of the Principle is \u201cthat It is and\nthat It is existent\u201d (inn wa-maw\u01e7\u016bd;\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VIII, 7, 367, 12\u201313): existence is\nnot what It \u201chas\u201d: It simply is.\n\nThis nuanced univocacy of being has been variously determined:\nscholars have adopted locutions like per prius and per\nposterius (Menn 2013: 163\u2013167 on Categories, I,\n2), \u201cambiguity of being\u2019s univocity\u201d (Druart 2014),\n\u201cmodulated univocity\u201d (Treiger 2012) and gradual\npredication or predication according to an arrangement:\n\u201cgradueller oder ordnungsbezogener\nPr\u00e4dikationsmodus\u201d (Koutzarova 2009: 211\u2013258) or\neven \u201canalogy\u201d (De Haan 2015). Certainly Avicenna\nattributes existence both to the Principle and to things; he ascribes\nto existence differences in worth (Categories 10\u201311;\nBertolacci 2011: 43\u201344)\u2014there is in fact an evident\nhierarchy governing necessity and possibility (see\n Section 4.4);\n he modulates existence according to the absolute or relative\nnecessity it expresses, clearly excludes the possibility that\nexistence is a genus or that it is predicated equally\n(bi-l-tas\u0101w\u012b) of what is beneath it, openly speaks\nabout its anteriority and posteriority within the same pattern of\nreference to be found in Aristotle (health:\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 5, 34, 15\u201335, 2; other passages\nsuggest a different analogy; Menn 2013) and clearly establishes the\nstarting-point of theology in the analysis of the existent. Existence\nas such has no graduations but has modes or statutes\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3, 276,12\u201314) and hierarchy\nis ascribed to reality (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3,\n277,7\u2013278,8). The necessary cause is more worthy of reality than\nthe effect: the essence of the cause is not necessary in relation to\nthe effect, whereas the essence of the effect is necessary only in\nrelation to the cause. \n",
