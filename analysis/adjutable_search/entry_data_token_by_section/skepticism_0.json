    "main_text": "Knowledge, Justification and Skepticism\n1. Knowledge, Justification and Skepticism\n\nPhilosophically interesting forms of skepticism claim that we do not\nknow propositions which we ordinarily think we do know. We should\ndistinguish such skepticism from the ordinary kind, the claim that we\ndo not know propositions which we would gladly grant not to know.\nThus, it is a form of ordinary skepticism to say that we do not know\nthat there are an even number of stars in the Milky Way, but it is a\nform of philosophical skepticism to say that we do not know that the\nsun will come out tomorrow. Even though our interest is in\nphilosophical skepticism, we can start our inquiry by thinking about\nordinary skepticism.\n\nWhy do we readily grant, then, that we don\u2019t know that there are\nan even number of stars in the Milky Way? To begin with, the vast\nmajority of us do not even believe that proposition, and it is widely\nacknowledged that knowledge requires\n belief.[1]\n But even those who believe it do not know it, even if they luck out\nand it is true. They do not know it because they are not\njustified in believing it, and knowledge requires\n justification.[2]\n Of course, they are not justified in disbelieving that proposition\neither. Belief and disbelief are two of the so-called doxastic\nattitudes that we can adopt towards a proposition. We can also,\nof course, not even consider a proposition, and thus not adopt any\ndoxastic attitude towards it. But most philosophers would hold that in\naddition to belief and disbelief there is a third possible doxastic\nattitude that we can adopt towards a proposition: we can suspend\njudgment (or withhold assent) with respect to it. Suspension of\njudgment is thus a bona fide doxastic attitude alongside\nbelief and disbelief, and is not to be equated with the failure to\nadopt any doxastic\n attitude.[3]\n Because it is a genuine doxastic attitude, suspension of judgment\n(just like belief and disbelief, and unlike the failure to form any\ndoxastic attitude) can itself be justified or unjustified. For\ninstance, we would ordinarily think that suspension of judgment is\nnot justified with respect to the proposition that Paris is\nthe Capital of France, but it is with respect to the proposition that\nthere are an even number of stars in the Milky Way.\n\nSome arguments for philosophical skepticism target knowledge directly,\nnot concerning themselves with justification. For instance, some argue\nthat we do not know certain propositions because our beliefs in them\nare not sensitive (in a sense to be explained below), and\nthey claim that sensitivity is a condition on knowledge\u2014but\nperhaps not on justified belief. We will examine the bearing of the\nsensitivity condition on skeptical arguments assuming that it applies\nto justification. But even if an argument for philosophical skepticism\ntargets our knowledge in a certain area while remaining silent about\nwhether we have justified beliefs in that area, that argument will\nstill indirectly target our justification as well. For, if the\nargument succeeds, then it provides us with knowledge (or at least\njustified belief) that we do not know a certain proposition p.\nAnd it is plausible to hold that if we know (or justifiably believe)\nthat we do not know a proposition p, then we are not even\njustified in believing p.\n\nIn what follows, then, we identify skepticism with respect to a field\nof propositions F as the claim that the only justified attitude\nwith respect to propositions in F is suspension of judgment.\nPhilosophical skepticism, then, differs from ordinary skepticism at\nleast regarding the field of propositions to which it is claimed to\napply. But even within the realm of philosophical skepticism we can\nmake an interesting distinction by appealing to the scope of the\nthesis.\n",
