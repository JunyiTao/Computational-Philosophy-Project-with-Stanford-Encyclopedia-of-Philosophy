    "main_text": "\n\nCombining physics, mathematics and computer science, quantum computing\nand its sister discipline of\n quantum information\n have developed in the past few decades from visionary ideas to two of\nthe most fascinating areas of quantum theory. General interest and\nexcitement in quantum computing was initially triggered by Peter Shor\n(1994) who showed how a quantum algorithm could exponentially\n\u201cspeed-up\u201d classical computation and factor large numbers\ninto primes far more efficiently than any (known) classical algorithm.\nShor\u2019s algorithm was soon followed by several other algorithms\nthat aimed to solve combinatorial and algebraic problems, and in the\nyears since theoretical study of quantum systems serving as\ncomputational devices has achieved tremendous progress. Common belief\nhas it that the implementation of Shor\u2019s algorithm on a large\nscale quantum computer would have devastating consequences for current\ncryptography protocols which rely on the premise that all known\nclassical worst-case algorithms for factoring take time\nexponential in the length of their input (see, e.g., Preskill 2005).\nConsequently, experimentalists around the world are engaged in\nattempts to tackle the technological difficulties that prevent the\nrealisation of a large scale quantum computer. But regardless whether\nthese technological problems can be overcome (Unruh 1995; Ekert and\nJozsa 1996; Haroche and Raimond 1996), it is noteworthy that no proof\nexists yet for the general superiority of quantum computers\nover their classical counterparts.\n\nThe philosophical interest in quantum computing is manifold. From a\nsocial-historical perspective, quantum computing is a domain where\nexperimentalists find themselves ahead of their fellow theorists.\nIndeed, quantum mysteries such as\n entanglement\n and\n nonlocality\n were historically considered a philosophical quibble, until\nphysicists discovered that these mysteries might be harnessed to\ndevise new efficient algorithms. But while the technology for\nharnessing the power of 50\u2013100 qubits (the basic unit of information\nin the quantum computer) is now within reach (Preskill 2018), only a\nhandful of quantum algorithms exist, and the question of whether these\ncan truly outperform any conceivable classical alternative is still\nopen. From a more philosophical perspective, advances in quantum\ncomputing may yield foundational benefits. For example, it may turn\nout that the technological capabilities that allow us to isolate\nquantum systems by shielding them from the effects of\n decoherence\n for a period of time long enough to manipulate them will also allow\nus to make progress in some fundamental problems in the foundations of\nquantum theory itself. Indeed, the development and the implementation\nof efficient quantum algorithms may help us understand better the\nborder between classical and quantum physics (Cuffaro 2017, 2018a; cf.\nPitowsky 1994, 100), and perhaps even illuminate fundamental concepts\nsuch as\n measurement\n and\n causality.\n Finally, the idea that abstract mathematical concepts such as\ncomputability and complexity may not only be\ntranslated into physics, but also re-written by physics bears\ndirectly on the autonomous character of computer science and the\nstatus of its theoretical entities\u2014the so-called\n\u201ccomputational kinds\u201d. As such it is also relevant to the\nlong-standing philosophical debate on the relationship between\nmathematics and the physical world.\n",
