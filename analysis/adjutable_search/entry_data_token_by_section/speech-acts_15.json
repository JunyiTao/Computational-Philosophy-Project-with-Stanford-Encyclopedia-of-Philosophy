After all, a mathematics teacher who proves a theorem T for her class likely wants her pupils to believe T on the strength of her proof rather than their recognition of her intention that they come to believe T. (Vlach 1981) It may even be doubted that speaker meaning requires intentions to produce cognitive effects on addressees at all: Davis (1992) provides a range of cases such as speaking to pre-linguistic infants, uncooperative photocopy machines, and photos of deceased loved ones.[14],[15] Instead of intentions to produce psychological effects in an addressee, some authors have advocated a construal of speaker meaning as overtly manifesting an aspect of one\u2019s commitments or state of mind (Green 2019). Compare my going to the closet to take out my overcoat (not a\ncase of speaker meaning), with the following case: After heatedly\narguing about the weather, I march to the closet while beadily meeting\nyour stare, then storm out the front door while ostentatiously donning\nthe coat. Here it is more plausible that I mean that it is raining\noutside, and the reason seems to be that I am making some attitude of\nmine overt: I am not only showing it, I am making clear my intention\nto do just that.\n\n",
