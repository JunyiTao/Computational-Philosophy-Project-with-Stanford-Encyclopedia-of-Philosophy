Where, for instance, is the virtue of patience? Or\nself-respect? Why does humor fall under the virtue of transcendence\n(for more questions like these, see Kristj\u00e1nsson 2013:\n151\u2013152)?\n\nThese are good questions, but not serious problems. For as we saw\nPeterson and Seligman were the first to admit that their\nclassification could need revision. If anything, these questions might\nhelp to make the VIA even better.\n\nA larger revision will be demanded by many Aristotelians, namely that\nthe list of virtues include practical wisdom (Kristj\u00e1nsson\n2013: chapter 7). On traditional Aristotelian approaches, practical\nwisdom is necessary for the possession of any virtue. Leaving it off\nthe list would be a serious omission, but again there is nothing about\nPeterson and Seligman\u2019s framework that would preclude it from\nbeing added (for more on practical wisdom, see Russell 2009; Miller\nforthcoming).\n\nIn fact, on the face of it philosophers should be quite amenable to\nthis framework, and be interested in incorporating it into their\nthinking about character. For unlike the Big Five, the VIA is focused\nspecifically on character traits, rather than personality traits in\ngeneral (Peterson and Park 2009: 26\u201327). And while there might\nbe a few omissions, it is remarkably comprehensive. Plus, unlike most\nadvocates of the Big Five, Peterson, Seligman, and their colleagues\nseem to be more comfortable describing character traits on\nmetaphysical grounds as dispositions with causal powers.\n\nBut caution is needed here (for a number of concerns, see Miller\n2019b). For the VIA, unlike the other three approaches examined in\nthis entry, was not arrived at empirically. As Peterson noted\nin a later article, \u201cOur classification of character strengths\nunder core virtues is a conceptual scheme and not an empirical\nclaim\u201d (Peterson and Park 2009: 31). We saw already that it is a\ntheoretical classification derived from the writings of philosophers,\nreligious thinkers, and famous exemplars of good character, as well as\nmore popular level expressions of character in greeting cards and\ngames (Peterson and Seligman 2004: 9\u201310). Furthermore, Peterson\nand Seligman are explicit that they aligned their approach with virtue\nethics (2004: 10).\n\nUnfortunately, subsequent empirical tests of the VIA have raised\nproblems. MacDonald and colleagues (2008) found that four factors,\nrather than the six in the VIA, best fit the questionnaire data.\nMcGrath (2014) found support for five factors. Noftle and his\ncolleagues (2011) used confirmatory factor analysis to test existing\nsix factor, five factor, four factor, and one factor models, and could\nnot find support for any of them (2011: 212). They concluded that,\n\n\nAlthough it is possible that an alternative model that was not tested\ncould capture the structure of the VIA scales, it seems more likely\nthat the VIA simply does not have a clear hierarchical structure\n(2011: 212).\n\n\nSee also the recent three virtue classification by McGrath 2015.\n\nSo it is not clear that the VIA is an empirically adequate framework\nfor thinking about character. It might have contributions to make in\nother ways, but if the goal is for philosophers to be able to draw on\npsychological research about character that is empirically informed,\nthen clearly more work is needed here.\n\nTwo other concerns arise as well. The first is methodological, in that\nlike the assessment measures for the Big Five, the VIA-IS is a\nquestionnaire measure which gathers self and other reports. When it\ncomes to character, philosophers are often worried about how much\nquestionnaires can tell us about what our characters are really\nlike.\n\nThe other concern is more conceptual. The VIA classification as\ndeveloped by Peterson and Seligman only appeals to positive character\ntraits. Strikingly absent are the vices (Kristj\u00e1nsson 2013: 7,\n153). It may be an admirable goal to try to get psychologists to pay\nmore attention to psychological health rather than illness, but that\ncan be done without dropping the vices entirely from one\u2019s\nclassification. Adding them, though, by canvassing once again all the\nsame philosophical, religious, and cultural resources, will require\nanother herculean undertaking on a par with what Peterson and Seligman\ndid in their 2004 handbook.\n",
