    "main_text": "Doubts about the distinctiveness of self-knowledge || General doubts\n2.1 General doubts\n\nThe idea that self-knowledge is not profoundly special was especially\nprevalent during the heyday of behaviorism. For instance, Ryle (1949)\nsuggests that the difference between self-knowledge and\nother-knowledge is at most a matter of degree, and stems from the\nmundane fact that each of us is always present to observe our own\nbehavior.\n\nDoubts about self-knowledge are also fueled by more general\nepistemological concerns, such as doubts about the possibility of\ntheory-free observations (Dennett 1991), and the familiar worry that\nthe observational process unavoidably alters the target of observation\n(Hill\n 1991).[2]\n Others argue that while self-attributions may express self-knowledge,\nthey are not epistemically superior to other kinds of beliefs.\n\n\nI suspect \u2026 [that our] judgments about the world to a large\nextent drive our judgments about our experience. Properly so, since\nthe former are the more secure. (Schwitzgebel 2008: 268)\n\n\nIn the same vein, some (including Stich 1983) deny that self-knowledge\nis special, relative to knowledge of others\u2019 states, by claiming\nthat ordinary (\u201cfolk\u201d) concepts of psychological states\nare theoretical concepts. If psychological states are theoretical\nentities, both self-ascriptions and other-ascriptions will proceed by\ninference from observed data\u2014presumably, behavior. (See the\nentry on\n folk psychology as a theory.)\n\nSkepticism of a different kind stems from a puzzle raised by\nBoghossian (1989). On most accounts, attitudes such as desires and\nbeliefs are individuated in part by their relations to other states\nand/or the\n environment.[3]\n For example, a desire for lemonade partly consists in being disposed\nto go to the refrigerator when one believes that there is lemonade\nthere, and to feeling happy at the prospect of drinking lemonade.\nBelieving there is lemonade in the refrigerator partly\nconsists in being disposed to go to the refrigerator when one desires\nlemonade, and to feeling surprise if one finds the refrigerator empty.\nMore generally, dispositional (or \u201cstanding\u201d) beliefs and desires\nconsist, partly or wholly, in dispositions to reason, behave, and\naffectively react in certain ways, relative to circumstances\n (see the entry on belief).\n Boghossian\u2019s puzzle concerns how we could have privileged\naccess to our relationally-individuated mental states. He considers\nthree ways that self-knowledge could be achieved: (a) on the basis of\ninner observation, (b) on the basis of inference, or (c) on the basis\nof nothing. He argues that (a) would not allow for knowledge of\nrelationally-individuated states, and that (b) and (c) do not provide\nfor access that is truly privileged. The result is a trilemma\nregarding self-knowledge.\n\nPhilosophers have responded to Boghossian\u2019s trilemma in a\nvariety of ways. Some deny the assumption that recognizing a\nrelationally-individuated state requires identifying the relational\nproperties that make it the state that it is (Burge 1988; Heil 1988).\nOthers argue that self-knowledge can be privileged even if it rests on\ninference (Dretske 1994; Byrne 2005; Lawlor 2009). And some maintain\nthat we can know our attitudes through introspective observation, and\nthat this weakens the case for relational construals of attitudes\n(Pitt 2004).\n",
