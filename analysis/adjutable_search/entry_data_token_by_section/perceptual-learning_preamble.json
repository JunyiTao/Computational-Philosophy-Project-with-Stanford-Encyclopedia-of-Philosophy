    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cPerceptual Learning\u201d refers, roughly, to long-lasting\nchanges in perception that result from practice or experience (see\nE.J. Gibson 1963). William James, for instance, writes about how a\nperson can become able to differentiate by taste between the upper and\nlower half of a bottle for a particular kind of wine (1890: 509).\nAssuming that the change in the person\u2019s perception lasts, is\ngenuinely perceptual (rather than, say, a learned inference), and is\nbased on prior experience, James\u2019 case is a case of perceptual\nlearning.\n\nThis entry has three parts. The first part lays out the definition of\nperceptual learning as long-term changes in perception that result\nfrom practice or experience, and then distinguishes perceptual\nlearning from several contrast classes. The second part specifies\ndifferent varieties of perceptual learning. The third part details\ncases of perceptual learning in the philosophical literature and says\nwhy they are philosophically significant.\n",
