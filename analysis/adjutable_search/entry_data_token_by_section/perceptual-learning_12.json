    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning || The Contents of Perception\n3.1 The Contents of Perception\n\nIn the philosophy literature, cases of perceptual learning have often\nbeen used to show that through learning we come to represent new\nproperties in perception, which we did not represent prior to\nlearning. Siegel (2006, 2010), for instance, asks us to suppose that\nwe have been tasked to cut down all and only the pine trees in a\nparticular grove of trees. After several months pass, she says, pine\ntrees might begin to look different to us. This is a case of\nperceptual learning, a long-term change in our perception following\npractice or experience with pine trees. Siegel uses the case to argue\nthat perception comes to represent kind properties, like the property\nof being a pine tree. The idea is that the best way to\nexplain the change in perception is that perception represents the\nproperty of being a pine tree after, but not before, learning\ntakes place. That property becomes part of the content of perception:\nit comes to be presented in perceptual experience (for more background\non the contents of perception, see Siegel 2016).\n\nThomas Reid\u2019s notion of acquired perception has\nrecently been interpreted in a way similar to Siegel\u2019s pine tree\ncase. According to Reid, some of our perceptions, namely acquired\nperceptions, are the result of prior experience. For instance, Reid\nwrites about how through experience we might come to \u201cperceive\nthat this is the taste of cyder,\u201d or \u201cthat this is the\nsmell of an apple,\u201d or that \u201cthis [is] the sound of a\ncoach passing\u201d ([1764] 1997: 171). Rebecca Copenhaver (2010,\n2016) has interpreted Reid as claiming that through experience\nproperties like being a cider, being an apple, and\nbeing a coach can come to be part of the content of our\nperception. \n\nCases of perceptual learning might also be used to show that through\nlearning we come to represent new properties in perception, even if\nthose properties are simply low-level properties like colors, shapes,\ntextures, and bare sounds, rather than high-level kind properties like\nbeing a pine tree or being a cider. For instance, in\ndiscussing the perceptual expertise of jewelers, the\n14th-century Hindu philosopher Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika\nwrites, \n\n\n[T]he difference among colours [of a precious stone], which was first\nconcealed by their similarity, is eventually made apparent as\nsomething sensual\u2026. (Freschi [trans.] manuscript,\nOther Internet Resources,  pp. 12\u201313)\n\n\nIn this case, the jeweler comes to perceive new colors in the\ngemstone, which others cannot perceive. This is a case where through\nlearning someone comes to perceive a new low-level property.\n\nThe cases from both Reid and Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika both speak to\nthe internal complexity of perception mentioned in the previous\nsection. If Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika\u2019s description of the\njeweler case is accurate, then perception is more than the inputs into\nour senses, since both an expert jeweler and a non-expert can have the\nsame visual inputs, but have different perceptions. Similarly, to take\na new example from Reid, suppose that a farmer acquires the ability to\nliterally see the rough amount corn in a heap ([1764] 1997: 172).\nSince both a farmer and a non-farmer can have the same visual inputs,\nbut have different perceptions, the causes of their perceptions are\nnot just restricted to the immediate objects out in their environment.\nPerception is more complex than that.\n\nOne of the most detailed contemporary discussions of cases of\nperceptual learning is found in Siewert (1998: section 7.9). Siewert\ndiscusses in detail the role that learning plays in altering\nperceptual phenomenology, although he stops short of saying that this\naffects the high-level contents of perception. He writes, for\ninstance, that there is a difference in perceptual phenomenology\nbetween just seeing \u201csomething shaped, situated, and colored in\na certain way,\u201d and recognizing that thing as a sunflower (or\nanother type) (1998: 255). Siewert also writes that a person might\nlook different to you after you know them for a long time than they\ndid the first time you met them, and that your neighborhood might look\ndifferent to you after you have lived there for a long time than the\nfirst time you moved in (pp. 256, 258). Furthermore, he writes about\nhow a chessboard in midgame might look differently to a chess player\nthan to a novice, and how a car engine might look differently to a\nmechanic than to someone unfamiliar with cars (1998: 258). These are\nall examples where learning affects one\u2019s sensory\nphenomenology.\n\nSeveral cases of perceptual learning in the philosophical literature\ninvolve language learning, both in the case of written and spoken\nlanguage. As an example of the former, Christopher Peacocke writes\nthat there is a difference \n\n\nbetween the experience of a perceiver completely unfamiliar with\nCyrillic script seeing a sentence in that script and the experience of\none who understands a language written in that script. (1992: 89) \n\n\nWith regard to spoken language, as Casey O\u2019Callaghan (2011)\npoints out, several philosophers have made the claim that after a\nperson learns a spoken language, sounds in that language comes to\nsound different to them (O\u2019Callaghan cites Block 1995: 234;\nStrawson 2010: 5\u20136; Tye 2000: 61; Siegel 2006: 490; Prinz 2006:\n452; and Bayne 2009: 390). Ned Block, for instance, writes,\n\u201c[T]here is a difference in what it is like to hear sounds in\nFrench before and after you have learned the language\u201d (1995:\n234). It is tempting to think that this difference is explicable in\nterms of the fact that, after learning a language, a person hears the\nmeanings of the words, where they do not before learning the language.\nOn such a view, meanings would be part of the contents of auditory\nperception. However, O\u2019Callaghan (2011) denies this (see also\nO\u2019Callaghan 2015 and Reiland 2015). He argues that the\ndifference is in fact due to a kind of perceptual learning.\nSpecifically, through learning we come to hear phonological features\nspecific to the new language. As O\u2019Callaghan argues, these\nphonological features, not the meanings, explain what it\u2019s like\nto hear a new language.\n\nBy contrast, Brogaard (forthcoming) argues that meanings are in fact\npart of the content of perception (see also Pettit 2010). After\noffering arguments against the opposing view, she relies on evidence\nabout perceptual learning to help make the positive case for her view.\nIn particular, she uses evidence about perceptual learning to rebut\nthe view that we use background information about context and combine\nit with what we hear, in order to get meanings. Instead, she argues,\nlanguage learning is perceptual in nature. She points to changes in\nhow we perceive utterances, more in chunks rather than in parts, as a\nresult of learning. Background information directly influences what we\nhear, she argues, altering how language sounds to us.\n\nBoth Siegel\u2019s pine tree case and the case of hearing a new\nlanguage fundamentally involve phenomenal contrasts. That is, the\nmotivating intuition in both cases is that there is a contrast in\nsensory phenomenology between two perceptual experiences.\nInterestingly, in both cases the phenomenal contrast is due to\nlearning. The question in both the pine tree case and the new language\ncase is what explains the difference in sensory phenomenology. Siegel\nargues that the best explanation in the pine tree case is that the\nproperty of being a pine (and, more generally, natural kind\nproperties) can come to be represented in perception.\nO\u2019Callaghan (2011) argues that the best explanation for the\ndifference in sensory phenomenology in the new language case is that\nwe come to hear phonological features specific to the new language.\nBrogaard (forthcoming) argues that the best explanation in that case\nis that we come to hear meanings in the new language.\n",
