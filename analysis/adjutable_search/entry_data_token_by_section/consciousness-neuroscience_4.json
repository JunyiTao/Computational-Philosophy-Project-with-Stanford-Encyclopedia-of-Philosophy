    "main_text": "Fundamentals || The Hard Problem\n1.5 The Hard Problem\n\nDavid Chalmers presents the hard problem as follows:\n\n\nIt is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But\nthe question of how it is that these systems are subjects of\nexperience is perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems\nengage in visual and auditory information-processing, we have visual\nor auditory experience: the quality of deep blue, the sensation of\nmiddle C? How can we explain why there is something it is like to\nentertain a mental image, or to experience an emotion? It is widely\nagreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but we have no\ngood explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical\nprocessing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively\nunreasonable that it should, and yet it does. If any problem qualifies\nas the problem of consciousness, it is this one. (Chalmers\n1995: 212)\n\n\nThe Hard Problem can be specified in terms of generic and specific\nconsciousness (Chalmers 1996). In both cases, Chalmers argues that\nthere is an inherent limitation to empirical explanations of\nphenomenal consciousness in that empirical explanations will be\nfundamentally either structural or functional, yet phenomenal\nconsciousness is not reducible to either. This means that there will\nbe something that is left out in empirical explanations of\nconsciousness, a missing ingredient (see also the explanatory\ngap [Levine 1983]).\n\nThere are different responses to the hard problem. One response is to\nsharpen the explanatory targets of neuroscience by focusing on what\nChalmers calls structural features of phenomenal\nconsciousness, such as the spatial structure of visual experience, or\non the contents of phenomenal consciousness. When we assess\nexplanations of specific contents of consciousness, these focus on the\nneural representations that fix conscious contents. These explanations\nleave open exactly what the secret ingredient is that shifts a state\nwith that content from unconsciousness to consciousness. On\ningredients explaining generic consciousness, a variety of options\nhave been proposed (see\n section 3),\n but it is unclear whether these answer the Hard Problem, especially\nif any answer to that the Problem has a necessary condition that the\nexplanation must conceptually close off certain possibilities, say the\npossibility that the ingredient could be added yet consciousness not\nignite as in a zombie, a creature without phenomenal consciousness\n(see the entry on\n zombies).\n Indeed, some philosophers deny the hard problem (see Dennett 2018 for\na recent statement). Patricia Churchland urges: \u201cLearn the\nscience, do the science, and see what happens\u201d (Churchland 1996:\n408).\n\nPerhaps the most common attitude for neuroscientists is to set the\nhard problem aside. Instead of explaining the existence of\nconsciousness in the biological world, they set themselves to\nexplaining generic consciousness by identifying neural properties that\ncan turn consciousness on and off and explaining specific\nconsciousness by identifying the neural representational basis of\nconscious contents.\n",
