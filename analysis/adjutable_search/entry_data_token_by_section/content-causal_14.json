    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories Conflict with the Implementation of Psychological Laws\n4.7 Causal Theories Conflict with the Implementation of Psychological Laws\n\nJason Bridges (2006) argues that the core hypothesis of informational\nsemantics conflicts with the idea that psychological laws are\nnon-basic. As we have just observed, causal theories are often taken\nto offer mere sufficiency conditions for meaning. Suppose, therefore,\nthat we suitably restrict the scope of a causal theory and understand\nits core hypothesis as asserting that all \u201cX\u201ds with the\ncontent X are reliably caused by X. (Nothing in the logic of\nBridges\u2019 argument depends on any additional conditions on a\nputative causal theory of mental content, so for simplicity we can\nfollow Bridges in restricting attention to this simple version.)\nBridges proposes that this core claim of a causal theory of mental\ncontent is a constitution thesis. It specifies what constitutes the\nmeaning relation (at least in some restricted domain). Thus, if one\nwere to ask, \u201cWhy is it that all \u2018X\u2019s with content X\nare reliably caused by Xs?,\u201d the answer is roughly,\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what it is for \u2018X\u2019 to have the\ncontent X\u201d. Being caused in that way is what constitutes having\nthat meaning. So, when a theory invokes this kind of constitutive\nrelation, there is this kind of constitutive explanation. So, the\nfirst premise of Bridges\u2019 argument is that causal theories\nspecify a constitutive relation between meaning and reliable causal\nconnection.\n\nBridges next observes that causal theorists typically maintain that\nthe putative fact that all \u201cX\u201ds are reliably caused by Xs\nis mediated by underlying mechanisms of one sort or another. So,\n\u201cX\u201ds might be reliably caused by dogs in part through the\nmediation of a person\u2019s visual system or auditory system.\nOne\u2019s visual apparatus might causally connect particular\npatterns of color and luminance produced by dogs to \u201cX\u201ds.\nOne might put the point somewhat differently by saying that a causal\ntheorist\u2019s hypothetical \u201cXs causes \u2018X\u2019s\u201d\nlaw is not a basic or fundamental law of nature, but an implemented\nlaw.\n\nBridges\u2019 third premise is a principle that he takes to be nearly\nself-evident, once understood. We can develop a better first-pass\nunderstanding of Bridges\u2019 argument if, at the risk of distorting\nthe argument, we consider a slightly simplified version of this\nprinciple:\n\n(S) If it is a true constitutive claim that all fs are\ngs, then it\u2019s not an implemented law that all\nfs are gs.\n\n\nTo illustrate the principle, suppose we say that gold is identical to\nthe element with atomic number 79, that all gold has atomic number 79.\nThen suppose one were to ask, \u201cWhy is it that all gold has the\natomic number 79?\u201d The answer would be, \u201cGold just\nis the element with atomic number 79.\u201d This would be a\nconstitutive explanation. According to (S), however, this constitutive\nexplanation precludes giving a further mechanistic explanation of why\ngold has atomic number 79. There is no mechanism by which gold gets\natomic number 79. Having atomic number 79 just is what makes gold\ngold.\n\nSo, here is the argument\n\nP1. It is a true constitutive claim that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\nP2. If it is a true constitutive claim that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs, then it is not an implemented law\nthat all \u201cX\u201ds with content X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens on P1 and P2,\n\nC1. It is not an implemented law that all \u201cX\u201ds with\ncontent X are reliably caused by Xs.\n\n\nBut, C1 contradicts the common assumption\n\nP3. It is an implemented law that all \u201cX\u201ds with content X\nare reliably caused by\n Xs.[13]\n\n\nRupert (2008) challenges the first premise of Bridges\u2019 argument\non two scores. First, he notes that claims about constitutive natures\nhave modal implications which at least some naturalistic philosophers\nhave found objectionable. Second, he claims that natural scientists do\nnot appeal to constitutive natures, so that one need not develop a\ntheory of mental content that invokes them.\n",
