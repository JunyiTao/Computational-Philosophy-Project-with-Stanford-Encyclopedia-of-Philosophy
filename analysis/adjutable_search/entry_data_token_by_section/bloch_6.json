This theory captures the\nheterogeneity of historical time and emphasizes the unsettled elements\nof the past as promises of yet unrealized\npossibilities\u2014something Bloch also paradigmatically develops in\nhis book on Thomas M\u00fcntzer. There, he develops the idea of\nactualization\u2014another name of\n\u201cself-encounter\u201d or affectedness\u2014 whereby the\nconcepts and the figures of history re-emerge on the scene to fulfill\nthe revolutionary promise.\n\nThe synchronicity of the non-synchronous is opposed to the linear\ndevelopmental vision of history that took shape in the Enlightenment.\nBloch\u2019s idea helps relativize this vision of progress. The\nheterogeneity of historical time gives voices to the plurality of\nhistorical temporalities, including non-Western societies. It is\nconnected to the fundamental non-identity of individual experience: an\nindividual is never contemporaneous to herself. Various social\nformations\u2014such as nations, geographical regions, classes, or\ninstitutional logics\u2014could be non-contemporaneous as\nsuch\u2014and to each other. Various non-contemporaneous elements\ncould both block the work of emancipation and help revitalize it after\nits alleged defeat. Non-contemporaneity is the proper concept for the\nutopian vision of society, permeated by revolutionary\ndiscontinuities.\n\nBloch\u2019s theory of modernity developed in Heritage of our\nTimes aims to explain the success of Nazi ideology by\ndemonstrating how it could incorporate the suppressed\nnon-contemporaneous elements (the ideas of a nation or kingdom\n[Reich]). By suggesting, in his review of\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 History and Class Consciousness, to\nmove, in Marxist dialectics, from the concept of totality to the\nconcepts of a sphere (GA 10), Bloch in fact tries to rethink the\nsocial analysis as a conglomerate of heterogenous temporalities that,\nhowever, interact with, oppose, and constitute each other. At times,\nhe appears to wish to overcome the non-contemporaneity in the vision\nof a true presence, which should be utopian and dialectically mediated\nby the future: \n\n\n[C]ontemporaneity is not such if it is not also super-contemporaneous;\nit is not the capitalist of the uncontrolled, changeable Today who\nstands at par with the real present but only the knower and controller\nof the Tomorrow in the Today together, in short, the active Marxist.\n(Bloch 1935 [1991: 195f.]) \n\n\nBloch\u2019s ideal of super-contemporaneity thus means embracing the\nintensity of the future in the present.\n\nIn the fight against the new conservatism, the non-contemporaneous\nsocial groups\u2014urban bourgeoisie, white-collar workers, peasants,\nyouth\u2014should play a specific role, often overlooked by textbook\nversions of historical materialism that only focused on the conflict\nbetween capitalists and industrial workers. Bloch criticizes the\nnarrow economistic version of historical materialism already in the\nbook on M\u00fcntzer, by making recourse to Max Weber. In Heritage\nof Our Times, he argues that German fascists could exploit the\nanti-capitalist utopian tendencies in these social strata and\nre-function them in their conservative political propaganda, thus\nmobilizing the energy of the non-contemporaneity, which should be\nregained by the more inclusive\n left.[7]\n\nBloch thus criticized overly positivist tendencies in Marxism (what\nLenin dubbed \u201cstupid materialism\u201d, see on that Levitas\n2012) that tended to dismiss all kinds of \u201cirrational\u201d\nelements precisely at the point where and when it was critical to\nengage with them. The same happens in capitalist society, where these\nelements tend to be repressed by the capitalist\n\u201ccontemporaneity\u201d. In co-opting them, Bloch follows the\nbasic dialectical strategy, forging a new synthesis with the\nother\u2014with something heterogeneous to capitalist or Marxist\nrationality. The promises and claims from the past serve both as\nexplanatory elements and as normative justifications for the new\npractical engagement with the \u201cheritage\u201d Bloch finds so\ncrucial.\n 3.4 Bloch on Natural Law\n\nOne particularly important case in this work of actualization is\nBloch\u2019s analysis of natural law, a legal dimension of utopian\npractical philosophy (Wagner 1995). The tradition of natural law as\nsomething more fundamental than statist legal structures, is going\nback to antiquity, but also to such scholars as Christian Thomasius\nand, for Bloch, to the values of the French revolution. What mostly\ninterests Bloch is the political dimension of the natural law\ndoctrine, its role for the critique of the positive law, its\ngrassroots nature, its focus on individual freedom, dignity, and\nrights of a citizen (in contrast to the pursuit of happiness\ncharacteristic for social utopias), as something to be fought for and\ndefended.\n\nWithin Marxism, Bloch reinstates the importance of human rights that\nare not inborn, but are something to fight for and uphold. He makes\nthem as necessary for the left political cause as the end of\nexploitation (Bloch 1961 [1986b: xxix]). Following his ontological\nbeliefs, Bloch does not wish to inherit the ahistorical ideas of human\nnature or some fixed universal principles. What remains an historical\ninvariant of the natural law tradition, for Bloch, is a drive towards\nfreedom (Gramm 1990). The essence of natural law is the idea of human\ndignity, captured in a metaphor of \u201cupright walk\u201d. The\ncontent or the foundation of dignity is the openness and the ability\nto transcend the frames of one\u2019s class or any other fixed\nposition in the social world. In the class society, positive law and\nstate are, for Bloch, instruments of domination.\n\nBloch\u2019s utopian ideal is thus natural law, but not positive law,\nthat would necessarily be misused by the ruling class; and it is an\nutopian humanistic community of dignity and love, existing beyond the\nstate. Note that Bloch\u2019s humanism is not built on the idea of an\nimmutable and immediately and intuitively given human nature. On the\ncontrary, he emphasizes that the true meaning of the human can only be\nanticipated and posited as an aim of history (Bloch 1961 [1986b:\n192]). Liberty, equality and fraternity are the utopian ideals of\nhuman individual and communitarian praxis that is in the process of\nseeking its most adequate\n realization.[8]\n",
