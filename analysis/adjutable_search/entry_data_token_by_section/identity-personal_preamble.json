    "main_text": "\n\nPersonal identity deals with philosophical questions that arise about\nourselves by virtue of our being people (or as lawyers and\nphilosophers like to say, persons). This contrasts with\nquestions about ourselves that arise by virtue of our being living\nthings, conscious beings, moral agents, or material objects. Many of\nthese questions occur to nearly all of us now and again: What am I?\nWhen did I begin? What will happen to me when I die? Others are more\nabstruse. They have been discussed since the origins of Western\nphilosophy, and most major figures have had something to say about\nthem. (There is also a rich but challenging literature on the topic in\nEastern philosophy: see the entry on\n Mind in Indian Buddhist Philosophy.)\n\nThe topic is sometimes discussed under the protean term self.\nThis term is sometimes synonymous with \u2018person\u2019, but often\nmeans something different: a sort of unchanging, immaterial subject of\nconsciousness, for instance (as in the phrase \u2018the myth of the\nself\u2019). It is often used without any clear meaning and will be\navoided here.\n\nAfter surveying the main questions of personal identity, the entry\nwill focus on our persistence through time.\n",
