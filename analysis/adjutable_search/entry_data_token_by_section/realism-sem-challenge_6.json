    "main_text": "The Anti-Realist Challenges to Metaphysical Realism || Conceptual Schemes and Pluralism\n3.5 Conceptual Schemes and Pluralism\n\nAccording to conceptual pluralists, there can no more be an answer to\nthe question \u201cWhat is the structure of the world?\u201d outside\nof some scheme for classifying entities than there can be an answer to\nthe question of whether two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are simultaneous\noutside of some inertial frame for dating those events. The objects\nthat exist are the objects some conceptual scheme says\nexists\u2014\u2018mesons exist\u2019 really means \u2018mesons\nexist relative to the conceptual scheme of current physics\u2019.\n\nRealists think there is a unitary sense of \u2018object\u2019,\n\u2018property\u2019 etc., for which the question \u201cwhat\nobjects and properties does the world contain?\u201d makes sense. Any\nanswer which succeeded in listing all the objects, properties, events\netc. which the world contains would comprise a privileged description\nof that totality [Putnam 1981]. Anti-realists reject this. For them\n\u2018object\u2019, \u2018property\u2019 etc., shift their senses\nas we move from one conceptual scheme to another. Some anti-realists\nargue that there cannot be a totality of all the objects the world\ncontains since the notion of \u2018object\u2019 is indefinitely\nextensible and so, trivially, there cannot be a privileged description\nof any such totality. [For discussions of indefinite extensibility see\nDummett 1978, 1991; Linnebo 2018; Warren 2017].\n\nHow does the anti-realist defend conceptual relativity? One way is by\narguing that there can be two complete theories of the world which are\ndescriptively equivalent yet logically incompatible from the\nrealist\u2019s point of view. For example, theories of space-time can\nbe formulated in one of two mathematically equivalent ways: as an\nontology of points, with spatiotemporal regions being defined as sets\nof points; or as an ontology of regions, with points being defined as\nconvergent sets of regions. Such theories are descriptively equivalent\nsince mathematically equivalent and yet are logically incompatible\nfrom the realist\u2019s point of view, anti-realists contend [Putnam\n1985, 1990].\n",
