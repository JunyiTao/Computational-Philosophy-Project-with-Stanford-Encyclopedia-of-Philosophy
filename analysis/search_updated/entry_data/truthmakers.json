    "preamble": "\n\nThis much is agreed: \u201cx makes it true that\np\u201d is a construction that signifies, if it signifies\nanything at all, a relation borne to a truth-bearer by something else,\na truth-maker. But it isn\u2019t generally agreed what that something\nelse might be, or what truth-bearers are, or what the character might\nbe of the relationship that holds, if it does, between them, or even\nwhether such a relationship ever does hold. Indeed sometimes\nthere\u2019s barely enough agreement amongst the parties to the\ntruth-maker dispute for them to be disagreeing about a common subject\nmatter. This makes navigating the literature about truth-makers a\ntreacherous undertaking but a necessary one because of the\nsignificance the debate about truth-makers bears for contemporary\nmetaphysics.\n\nWe can distinguish between the following questions that different\napproaches to truth-makers have been framed to answer:\n\nWhat is it to be a truth-maker?\nWhich range, or ranges, of truths are eligible to be made true (if\nany are)?\nWhat kinds of entities are truth-makers?\nWhat is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers?\n\n\nThese questions cannot be addressed in isolation from one another. Our\nthinking about what it is to be a truth-maker will likely have\nknock-on effects for how we answer the second and third questions. Our\nbeliefs about which truths have truth-makers will likely shape our\nanswer to the first and third. And the theoretical benefits that we\nthink will come our way from positing truth-makers in the first place\nwill no doubt exert a controlling influence upon our responses to the\nother questions. We\u2019ll start with the issue of what it is to be\na truth-maker.\n\nThe notion of a truth-maker, like that of a clapping hand, cannot\nultimately be understood in isolation from the notion of what it makes\ntrue, the other hand with which it claps, a truth-bearer. There are a\nvariety of different candidate fillers for the role of\ntruth-bearers\u2014sentence tokens, judgements, propositions\netc\u2014and very often discussion of truth-makers and\ntruth-making proceeds without an eye to which candidate best fills\nthis role. This is understandable: metaphysicians are typically\ninterested in what there is rather than representations thereof. But\ntruth-bearers are the elephant in the room during these discussions.\nEventually we\u2019ll have to talk about them because what we think\nabout truth-bearers will have consequences for what we think about\ntruth-makers. So there\u2019s a further question that we can\u2019t\nput off answering indefinitely,\n\nWhat are the truth-bearers?\n\n\nFor the time being we\u2019ll remain relatively non-committal about\nthe character of truth-bearers except for making the minimal\nassumption that truth-bearers are inherently representational in\ncharacter. But eventually the issue will become unavoidable.\n\nI will not dwell upon the history of the concept truth-maker.\nAnticipations of the contemporary use of the concept have been found\nin Aristotle and Suarez (Fox 1987; K\u00fcnne 2003: 150\u20134;\nSchmutz 2007), Leibniz (Armstrong 1997: 14; Mulligan 2009:\n39\u201342), Russell and Wittgenstein (Hochberg 1978; Mulligan,\nSimons, & Smith 1984: 287\u20139, 308\u201312; Simons 1992:\n156\u201361; K\u00fcnne 2003: 118\u2013226, 145\u20138), Stout,\nMcTaggart and Pf\u00e4nder (Mulligan 2009). But it has also been\ndisputed whether these authors are really deploying the concept of\ntruth-making with which we are familiar rather than\nemploying, perhaps for reasons of grammatical convenience,\nsuperficially similar turns of phrase that make it sound as if they\nare expressing our concept (Dodd 2002: 81\u20133; MacBride 2005:\n137\u20139; Glock 2007).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. What is a Truth-maker?\n\nTruth-makers are often introduced in the following terms (Bigelow\n1988: 125; Armstrong 1989c: 88):\n\n(Virtue-T)\na truth-maker is that in virtue of which something is true\n\n\nThe sense in which a truth-maker \u201cmakes\u201d something true is\nsaid to be different from the causal sense in which, e.g., a potter\nmakes a pot. It is added that the primary notion of a truth-maker is\nthat of a minimal one: a truth-maker for a truth-bearer\np none of whose proper parts or constituents are truth-makers\nfor p. (Whether every proposition has a minimal truth-maker\nis contentious.) We are also cautioned that even though people often\nspeak as if there is a unique truth-maker for each truth, it is\nusually the case that one truth is made true by many things\n(collectively or severally).\n\nWhether (Virtue-T) provides a satisfactory elucidation of\ntruth-making depends on whether we have a clear understanding of\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d. Some philosophers argue this notion is an\nunavoidable primitive (Rodriguez-Pereyra 2006a: 960\u20131). But\nothers are wary. Thus, for example, Bigelow finds the locution\n\u201cin virtue of\u201d both obscure and, as will see, avoidable\n\u201cwe should not rest content with an explanation which turns on\nthe notion of virtue!\u201d (Bigelow 1988). These kinds of\nconcern provides a significant motivation for establishing whether it\nis possible to elucidate the concept of truth-making in terms\nof notions that enjoy a life independently of the circle of notions to\nwhich in virtue of and truth-making belong.\n1.1 Truth-making as Entailment\n\nOne influential proposal for making an elucidatory advance upon\n(Virtue-T) appeals to the notion of entailment (Fox\n1987: 189; Bigelow 1988: 125\u20137):\n\n(Entailment-T)\n a truth-maker is a thing the very existence of which entails that\nsomething is true.\n\n\nSo x is a truth-maker for a truth p iff x\nexists and another representation that says x exists entails\nthe representation that p. It is an attraction of this\nprinciple that the key notion it deploys, namely entailment, is\nubiquitous, unavoidable and enjoys a rich life outside\nphilosophy\u2014both in ordinary life and in scientific and\nmathematical practice.\n\nUnfortunately this account threatens to over-generate truth-makers for\nnecessary truths\u2014at least if the notion of entailment it employs\nis classical. It\u2019s a feature of this notion that anything\nwhatsoever entails a necessary truth p. It follows as a\nspecial case of this that any claim that a given object exists must\nentail p too. So it also follows\u2014if\n(Entailment-T) is granted\u2014that any object makes any\nnecessary truth true. But this runs counter to the belief that, e.g.,\nthe leftovers in your refrigerator aren\u2019t truth-makers for the\nrepresentation that 2+2=4. Even worse, Restall has shown how to\nplausibly reason from (Entailment-T) to \u201ctruth-maker\nmonism\u201d: the doctrine that every truth-maker makes every truth\ntrue (whether necessary or contingent). Every claim of the form\np \u2228 ~p is a necessary truth. So every existing\nthing s is a truth-maker for each instance of this form (see\npreceding paragraph). Now let p be some arbitrary truth\n(grass is green) and s any truth-maker for p \u2228\n~p (a particular ice floe in the Antarctic ocean). Now it is\nintuitively plausible that something makes a disjunction true\neither by making one disjunct true or by making the\nother disjunct true (Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 316). This is\nwhat Restall calls \u201cthe disjunction thesis\u201d. It follows\nfrom this thesis that either s makes p true or\ns makes ~p true. Given that p is true,\nneither s nor anything else makes it true that ~p.\nSo s (the ice floe) must make it true that p (grass\nis green)! But since s and p were chosen arbitrarily\nit follows that all truth-makers are on a par, making true every truth\n(Restall 1996: 333\u20134).\n\nThe unacceptability of these results indicates that insofar as we have\nan intuitive grip upon the concept of a truth-maker it is constrained\nby the requirement that a truth-maker for a truth must be relevant to\nor about what it represents as being the case. For example, the truths\nof pure arithmetic are not about what\u2019s at the back of your\nrefrigerator; what\u2019s there isn\u2019t relevant to their being\ntrue. So we\u2019re constrained to judge that what\u2019s there\ncannot be truth-makers for them. This suggests that operating at the\nback of our minds when we issue these snap judgements there must be\nsomething like the principle:\n\n(Relevance) \nwhat makes something true must\u2014in some\nsense\u2014be what it is \u201cabout\u201d.\n\n\nOf course the notions of \u201cabout\u201d and\n\u201crelevance\u201d are notoriously difficult to pin down (Goodman\n1961). And a speaker can know something is true without knowing\neverything about what makes it true. Often it will require empirical\nresearch to settle what makes a statement true. Moreover, what is\ndetermined a posteriori to be a truth-maker may exhibit a\ncomplexity quite different from that of the statement it makes true\n(Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 299). Nevertheless, it is clear\nthat unless (Entailment-T) is constrained in some way it will\ngenerate truth-makers that are unwanted because their presence\nconflicts with (Relevance).\n\nOne way to restore accord between them would be to abandon the\nDisjunction Thesis that together with (Entailment-T) led us\ndown the path to Truth-maker Monism. Indeed isn\u2019t the\nDisjunction Thesis dubious anyway? Consider examples involving the\nopen future. Can\u2019t we imagine a situation arising that makes it\ntrue that one or other of the horses competing in a race will win, but\nwhich neither makes it true that one of the horses in particular will\nwin nor makes it true that another will (Read 2000; Restall 2009)? For\nfurther discussion of issues surrounding truthmaking entailment, the\nDisjunctive Thesis and the Conjunctive Thesis, i.e. the principle that\na truthmaker for a conjunction is a truthmaker for its conjuncts, see\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2006a, 2009, Jago 2009, Lopez de Sa (2009) and\nTalasiewicz (et al) (2012). \n\nBut even if the Disjunction Thesis is given up still this leaves in\nplace the embarrassing consequence of defining what it is to be a\ntruth-maker in terms of classical entailment, viz. that\nany existing thing turns out to be a truth-maker for\nany necessary truth. Some more radical overhaul of\n(Entailment-T) is needed to avoid over-generation. One\npossibility is to redefine what is to be a truth-maker in terms of a\nmore restrictive notion of \u201crelevant entailment\u201d (in the\ntradition of Anderson & Belnap) that requires what is entailed to\nbe relevant to what it is entailed by (Restall 1996, 2000; Armstrong\n2004: 10\u201312). Whether exploring this avenue will take us very\nfar remains a matter of dispute. Simons, for example, reflects, \n\n\nIn truth however I suspect our intuitions about truth-makers may be at\nleast as robust as our intuitions about what is good for a logical\nsystem of implication, and I would not at present attempt to explicate\ntruth-making via the arrow of the relevance logic system\nR. (2008: 13)\n\n\nNevertheless since truth-making concerns the bestowal of truth,\nentailment its preservation, there must at some level be an\nimportant connection to be made out between truth-making and\nentailment; the effort expended to make out such a connection will be\neffort spent to the advantage of metaphysicians and logicians alike.\nBut even granted this is so there are reasons to be doubtful that any\noverhaul of (Entailment-T), however radical, will capture\nwhat it is to be a truth-maker. One vital motivation for believing in\ntruth-makers is this. Positing truth-makers enables us to make sense\nof the fact that the truth of something depends on how things stand\nwith an independently given reality. This is how Bigelow reports what\nhappens to him when he stops believing in truth-makers: \n\n\nI find I have no adequate anchor to hold me from drifting onto the\nshoals of some sort of pragmatism or idealism. And that is altogether\nuncongenial to me; I am a congenital realist. (1988: 123) \n\n\nTruth-makers are posited to provide the point of semantic contact\nwhereby true representations touch upon an independent reality, upon\nsomething non-representational. Since entailment is a relation between\nrepresentations it follows that the notion of a truth-maker cannot be\nfully explicated in terms of the relation of\nentailment\u2014regardless of whether representations are best\nunderstood as sentences or propositions or some other candidate\ntruth-bearer (Heil 2000: 233\u20134; 2003: 62\u20135; Merricks 2007:\n12\u201313). Ultimately (Entailment-T), or a relevance logic\nversion if it, will leave us wanting an account of what makes a\nrepresentation of the existence of a truth-maker\u2014whatever it\nentails\u2014itself beholden to an independent reality.\n1.2 Truth-making as Necessitation\n\nThis difficulty arises because entailment is a relation that lights\nupon representations at both ends. Appreciating this Armstrong\nrecognised that truth-making \n\n\ncannot be any form of entailment. Both terms of an entailment relation\nmust be propositions, but the truth-making term of the truth-maker\nrelation is a portion of reality, and, in general at least, portions\nof reality are not propositions. (2004: 5\u20136; see also Lowe 2006:\n185)\n\n\nAccordingly Armstrong made a bold maneuver. He posited a\nmetaphysically primitive relation of necessitation (i.e., one not\nitself defined in terms of possible worlds because Armstrong is\n\u201copposed to the extensional view proposed by those who put\nmetaphysical faith in possible worlds\u201d preferring an\n\u2018intensional account\u2019 of modality instead (1997: 151,\n2004: 96)). The relation in question lights upon a portion of reality\nat one end and upon a truth at the other. In the simplest case that\nmeans that the truth making relation is one that \u201cholds between\nany truthmaker, T, which is something in the world, and the\nproposition\u201d that T exists (2004: 6). Armstrong then\ndefined what is to be a truth-maker in terms of this metaphysical\nbridging relation:\n\n(Necessitation-T)\n a truth-maker is a thing that necessitates something\u2019s\nbeing true.\n\n\nThis conception of truth making avoids the \u201ccategory\u201d\nmistake that results from attempting to define truth-making in terms\nof entailment. It also makes some advance upon (Virtue-T) and\nits primitive use of \u201cin virtue of\u201d because at least\n(Necessitation-T) relates the notion of truth making to other\nmodal notions, like that of necessity, upon which we have some\nindependent handle. But what is there positively to be said in favour\nof conceiving of truth-makers in terms of \u201cnecessitation\u201d?\nSuppose that T is a candidate truth-maker for a truth\np even though T fails to necessitate p.\nThen it is possible for T to exist even when p is\nfalse. Armstrong now reflects \u201cwe will surely think that the\nalleged truth-maker was insufficient by itself and requires to be\nsupplemented in some way\u201d (1997: 116). Suppose this\nsupplementary condition is the existence of another entity,\nU. Then \u201cT+U would appear to be the\ntrue and necessitating truth-maker for p\u201d (2004: 7).\nArmstrong concludes that a truth-maker for a truth must necessitate\nthe truth in question.\n\nUnfortunately this argument takes us nowhere except around in a\ncircle. (Necessitation-T) embodies the doctrine that it is\nboth necessary and sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing\nnecessitates the truth it makes true. Armstrong\u2019s argument for\nthis doctrine relies upon the dual assumptions: (1) anything that\nfails to necessitate p (witness T) cannot be a\ntruth-maker for p,whereas (2) anything that succeeds in\nnecessitating p (witness T+U) must be. But\n(1) just is the claim that it is necessary, and (2) just the claim\nthat it is sufficient for being a truth-maker that a thing\nnecessitates the truth it makes true. Since it relies upon (1) and\n(2), and (1) and (2) are just equivalent to\n(Necessitation-T), it follows that Armstrong\u2019s argument\nis incapable of providing independent support for the conception he\nfavours of what it is to be a truth-maker.\n\nEven though this argument may be circular, does\n(Necessitation-T) at least have the favourable feature that\nadopting it enables us to avoid the other difficulty that beset\n(Entailment-T), viz. over-generation? Not if there\nare things that necessitate a truth whilst still failing to be\nsufficiently relevant to be plausible truth-makers for it. If the\nnecessitation relation is so distributed that it holds between any\ncontingently existing portion of reality, e.g., an ice-floe, and any\nnecessary truth, e.g., 2+2=4, then we shall be no further forward than\nwe were before. So Armstrong needs to tell us more about the\ncross-categorial relation in question to assure us that such cases\ncannot arise. Smith suggests another problem case for\n(Necessitarian-T). \n\n\nSuppose that God wills that John kiss Mary now. God\u2019s willing\nact thereby necessitates the truth of \u201cJohn is kissing\nMary\u201d. (For Malebranche, all necessitation is of this sort.) But\nGod\u2019s act is not a truth-maker for this judgement. (Smith 1999:\n6)\n\n\nIf such cases are possible then (Necessitation-T) fails to\nprovide a sufficient condition for being a truth-maker.\n\nIn fact the commitment already emerges from (Necessitarian-T)\nif the necessitation relation it embodies is conceived as internal in\nthe following sense: \u201cAn internal relation is one where the\nexistence of the terms entails the existence of the relation\u201d\nstrung out between the terms; otherwise a relation is external\n(Armstrong 1997: 87). Armstrong argues that the relation of\ntruth-making has to be internal (in just this sense) because if it\nweren\u2019t then we would have to allow that, absurdly,\n\u201canything may be a truth-maker for any truth\u201d (1997: 198).\nBut then nothing but propositions\u2014conceived in the\nself-interpreting sense\u2014can be truth-bearers that are internally\nrelated to their truth-makers. Any other candidate for this\nrepresentational role, as we\u2019ve already reflected\u2014a token\nbelief state or utterance\u2014could have been endowed with a\ndifferent representational significance than the one it possesses. So\nthe other eligible candidates, by contrast to propositions,\naren\u2019t internally related to what makes them true.\n\nArmstrong\u2019s commitment to the truth-making relation\u2019s\nbeing internal clashes with his naturalism (David 2005: 156\u20139).\nAccording to Armstrong, \n\n\nTruth attaches in the first place to propositions, those propositions\nwhich have a truth-maker. But no Naturalist can be happy with a realm\nof propositions. (Armstrong 1997: 131) \n\n\nSo Armstrong counsels that we don\u2019t take propositions with\n\u201contological seriousness\u201d: \n\n\nWhat exists are classes of intentionally equivalent tokens. The\nfundamental correspondence, therefore, is not between\nentities called truths and their truth-makers, but between the token\nbeliefs and thoughts, on the one hand, and truth-makers on the other.\n(Armstrong 1997: 131)\n\n\nBut naturalistically kosher token beliefs and thoughts aren\u2019t\ninternally related to what makes them true. So Armstrong\u2019s\nnaturalism commits him to denying that the truth-making relation is\ninternal after all. Heil has also inveighed in a naturalistic spirit\nagainst incurring a commitment to propositions that are designed to\nhave their own \u201cbuilt-in intentionality\u201d whilst continuing\nto maintain that truth-making is an internal relation (2006:\n240\u20133). Since we have no idea of what a naturalistic\nrepresentation would look like that was internally related to what\nmade it true, this appears to be an impossible combination of views.\nOur inability to conjure up a credible class of truth-bearers that are\ninternally related to their truth-makers provides us with a very\nstrong incentive for supposing that the truth-making relation is\nexternal. The long and short of it: if we are wary, as many\nnaturalists are, of the doctrine that truth-bearers are propositions,\nthen we should also be wary of thinking that the truth-making relation\nis internal. This spells trouble for (Necessitarian-T) and\nany other account of truth making which invoke internal relations to\npropositions.\n1.3 Truth-making as Projection\n\nSmith tries to get around this problem by adding to\n(Necessitation-T) the further constraint that a truth-maker\nfor a given truth should be part of what that truth is about:\n\u201croughly: it should fall within the mereological fusion of all\nthe objects to which reference is made in the judgment\u201d (1999:\n6). His suggestion is that a typical contingent judgement p\nnot only makes singular reference to the objects whose antics it\ndescribes but also \u201cgeneric reference\u201d to the events,\nprocesses and states that are associated with the main verb of the\nsentence that is used to express the judgement in question. So, for\nexample, the judgement that John is kissing Mary incorporates not only\nsingular reference to John and Mary but also generic reference to all\nkisses. Smith identifies the projection of a judgement with\nthe fusion of all these things to which it refers (singularly or\ngenerically). He then defines what is to be a truth-maker in terms of\nthis notion:\n\n(Projection T) \na truth-maker for a judgement p is something that\nnecessitates p and falls within its projection\n\n\nSince God\u2019s act of willing isn\u2019t one of the things to\nwhich the judgement that John is kissing Mary makes singular or\ngeneric reference\u2014it doesn\u2019t fall within the projection of\nthis judgement\u2014His act isn\u2019t a truth-maker for this\njudgement. But that fateful kiss does fall within the generic\nreference of the judgement that John is kissing Mary and\nnecessitates the truth of that judgement; so the kiss is a truth-maker\nfor it.\n\nWhether taking up (Projection-T) will avoid classifying\nmalignant cases of necessitating things as truth-makers will depend\nupon whether the notion of projection can be made sufficiently precise\nto vindicate the intuition that the net cast by a judgement\nwon\u2019t catch these unwanted fishes with the rest of its haul;\nwhether if the judgement that \u03c6x incorporates singular\nreference to x and generic reference to \u03c6-ings, it\ndoesn\u2019t incorporate (even more) generic reference to anything\nelse that may (waywardly) necessitate \u03c6x. (Here\n\u201c\u03c6\u201d indicates the place for a verb phrase and\n\u201cx\u201d a place for a name.)\n\nSmith attempts to make the notion of projection precise using just\nmereology and classical entailment. Something belongs to the\nprojection of a judgement that \u03c6x only if it is one of\nthe things to which the judgement is existentially committed (Smith\n1999: 7). In order to capture the \u201cgeneric\u201d as well as the\nsingular consequences of a judgement, Smith includes amongst its\nexistential consequences the fusions that result from applying the\nmereological comprehension principle (T\u2264)\n(\u2203x\u03c6x iff there exists a unique fusion of\nall and only those x such that \u03c6x) to the\nimmediate commitments of the judgement. For example, the judgement\nthat Nikita meows is immediately committed to the existence of a meow\nand thereby to the unique fusion of all and only meows. Because\nGod\u2019s act of willing John to kiss Mary doesn\u2019t fall within\nthe class of logical-cum-mereological consequences of the judgement\nthat John is kissing Mary, His act isn\u2019t a truth-maker for\nit.\n\nBut this still threatens to over-generate truth-makers (Gregory 2001).\nThe judgement that John is kissing Mary has amongst it existential\nconsequences that someone exists. Since Smith assumes that\n\u201cx exists\u201d, like \u201cx meows\u201d\nand \u201cx kisses Mary\u201d, is a predicate, it also\nfollows via (T\u2264) that the projection of this judgement\nincludes the fusion of all and only existing things (Smith 1999: 10).\nBut since (ex hypothesi) God\u2019s act exists\u2014and so\nbelongs to the aforementioned fusion and thereby the projection of the\njudgement in question\u2014and necessitates that John is kissing\nMary, it fails to rule out God\u2019s act as a truth-maker for\nit!\n\nThe projection of a judgement needs to be made far more relevant to\nwhat a judgement is intuitively about; the logical-mereological notion\nof a projection supplied doesn\u2019t even provide a basis for\naffirming that singular judgements don\u2019t generically refer to\nevery existing thing. An initial attractive move to avoid this\nparticular problem would be to deny that \u201cexists\u201d is a\npredicate. But more generally, it remains to be seen whether an\nappropriate notion of a judgement\u2019s referential net, its\nprojection, can be made out that\u2019s isn\u2019t too\npermissive\u2014thereby including illegitimate\ntruth-makers\u2014without having to deploy resources that are not\nobviously clearer or more problematic than that of truth-making itself\n(see Smith 2002 and Schnieder 2006b for contrasting prognoses).\n1.4 Truthmaking in terms of Essentialism\n\nOthers attempt to avoid over-generating truth-makers by appealing to\nthe notion of essence, a notion that purports to be far more\ndiscriminating than necessitation (Fine 1994; Lowe 1994). The\ndifference in grain between these notions becomes evident when we\nreflect that although it is (supposed to be) necessarily the case that\nif Socrates exists then his singleton does too, it isn\u2019t part of\nthe essence of Socrates that he belongs to this set. If these notions\nreally are different then we will need to distinguish between those\nentities that merely necessitate a true claim on the one hand and\nthose that are also part of its essence on the other. This suggests a\nstrategy for ruling out spurious truth-makers: they\u2019re the ones\nthat only necessitate true claims, whereas the real ones are also\nimplicated (somehow) in the essences of the claims they make true.\n\nThis brings us back to the question of truth-bearers. If truth-makers\nare implicated in the essences of truth-bearers then truth-bearers can\nneither be sentences nor judgements. Truth-bearers of these kinds only\nbear their representational features accidentally; they could have\nbeen used to say or think something different, or occurred in contexts\nwhere they lacked significance altogether. Since they could have meant\nsomething different, or nothing at all, the truth-makers of these\ntruth-bearers can hardly be implicated in their essences. Accordingly\ntruth-bearers that essentially implicate their truth-makers must be\ncreatures that could not have shifted or lacked their representational\nfeatures. They must be propositions in the deep sense of\nbeing items that are incapable of meaning anything other than they do.\nConceiving of propositions only in this sense and appealing to their\nessences, what is to be a truth-maker admits of the following\ndefinition (Mulligan 2003: 547, 2006: 39, 2007; Lowe 2006:\n203\u201310, 2009: 209\u201315):\n\n(Essential-T) \na truth-maker of a proposition is something such that it is part\nof the essence of that proposition that it is true if that thing\nexists.\n\n\nIf this definition is adopted then it is plausible to maintain that\nmany of the spurious cases of truth-makers, which have afflicted\naccounts of truth-making in terms of entailment, necessitation or\nprojection, will thereby be weeded out (Lowe 2006: 202\u20133). It\nisn\u2019t part of the essence of the proposition that John is\nkissing Mary that it is true if there exists an act of God\u2019s\nwilling it. Nor is it part of the essence of the proposition that\n2+2=4 that it is true if there is a particular ice floe in the\nAntarctic. It isn\u2019t even part of the essence of the proposition\nthat 2+2=4 that it is true if \u03c0 exists. So none of these things are\n(spuriously) classified, if (Essential-T) is our touchstone,\nas truth-makers for these propositions. In this respect, the\nessentialist conception of truth-making has conspicuous advantages\nover its aforementioned rivals.\n\nNevertheless, on the downside, it may be questioned whether our grip\nupon the notion of the essence of a proposition is any firmer than the\nnotion of truth-maker for it. Moreover, the benefits of adopting\n(Essential-T) come at a cost. The idea of a truth-maker is\nintroduced as \u201cintuitively attractive\u201d (Lowe 2006: 207).\nBut (Essential-T) requires propositions that are not only\nabstract\u2014already anathema to naturalists\u2014but also\nmysterious, because they are, so to speak, self-interpreting, i.e.\npropositions that mean what they do irrespective of what speakers or\nthinkers ever do with the signs or judgements that express them. So\nthe idea of a truth-maker turns out to be far less intuitive and\nattractive than it initially seemed. Nonetheless, this is a commitment\nsome may accept anyway (Lowe 2009: 178\u201380), or may be willing to\naccept if it gives them a good account of truth-making.\n\nEssentialist conceptions of truth-making have proved less influential\nin the recent literature than grounding conceptions (1.6 below). This\nis surprising in light of the affinities between the notions of ground\nand essence, especially given the possibility, favoured by some, of\nexplaining grounding in terms of essence (Correia 2013). This also\nmeans that at least some of the attractions and some of the objections\nto a grounding approach to truth making, discussed below, are liable\nto carry over to an essentialist approach. \n1.5 Axiomatic Truth-making\n\nThe difficulties that have beset the definitions of truth-making\nproffered so far have suggested to some philosophers that a\npessimistic induction is in order: that the project of defining\ntruth-making in more basic terms is misconceived, much as the project\nof defining knowledge in more basic terms has come to seem\nmisconceived because e.g., of the Gettier cases. But there\u2019s no\ngain to be had from, doing nothing more than declaring the notion of a\ntruth-maker to be primitive. If it\u2019s primitive then we also need\nto know how the notion may be fruitfully applied in association with\nother concepts we already deploy\u2014entailment, existence, truth\netc.\u2014to describe the interplay of truth-bearers and the\nworld. As Simons remarks, \n\n\nThe signs are that truth-making is not analysable in terms of anything\nmore primitive, but we need to be able to say more than just that. So\nwe ought to consider it as specified by principles of truth-making.\n(2000: 20) \n\n\nIn other words, the notion needs to be introduced non-reductively but\nstill informatively and this is to be achieved by appealing to its\nsystematic liaisons with other concepts.\n\nThis is the approach that was originally shared by Mulligan, Simons\nand Smith (1984: 312\u20138). The principal schemata they employed to\nconvey to us an articulate grasp of what truth-making means\nin non-reductive terms included:\n\n(i)\n(Factive) If A makes it true that p, then\np\n(ii)\n(Existence) If A exists, then A makes it true\nthat A exists\n(iii)\n (Entailment) If A makes it true that p, and\nthat p entails that q, then A makes it true\nthat q\n\n\nEach of these schemata specifies a definite linkage between the\napplication of the notion of truth-making and some other\ncondition. Truth-making is introduced as the notion that\nsustains all of these linkages. Putting the schemata together what it\nis to be a truth-maker is then definable intra-theoretically as\nfollows,\n\n(Axiomatic-T) \nA truth-maker is something x such that (i) if x\nmakes it true that p then p, (ii) if x\nexists then x makes it true that x exists\u2026\nand so on for each of the axiom schemata of our favoured theory of\ntruth-makers.\n\n\nIt is important to appreciate that adopting this approach to\ntruth-making doesn\u2019t have the benefits of theft over honest\ntoil. For one thing it doesn\u2019t obviate the threat of superfluous\ntruth-makers for necessary truths. (Entailment) is the\nprinciple that truth-making tracks entailment: if A makes\np true then it makes all the consequences of p true\ntoo. It\u2019s a principle that recommends itself irrespective of\nwhether truth-making can be defined. This is because it dovetails\nsmoothly with the idea that one truth-maker can make many truths true.\nFor example, suppose that a particular a has some absolutely\ndeterminate mass. It is entailed by this description that various\ndeterminable descriptions are also truly predicable of a.\nSome of these truths say more than others, nonetheless they all have\nthe same truth-maker. Why so? Because they are entailed by\na\u2019s having the mass it does (Armstrong 1997: 130; 2004:\n10\u201311). To answer so is to appeal to (Entailment). But\nif the entailment that truth-making tracks is classical then we are\nback to flouting (Relevance). If q is necessary then\nany contingent p classically entails q. So if\nsomething at the back of your refrigerator makes it true that\np then by (Entailment) it makes q true too.\nTo avoid flouting (Relevance) in this way\n(Entailment) had better be a principle that links\ntruth-making to a more restrictive, non-classical notion of entailment\n(Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 316). So we won\u2019t be saved\nthe logical labour of figuring out which non-classical connective it\nis that contributes to capturing what it is to be a truth-maker. Nor\nwill appealing to (Axiomatic-T) save us the hard work of\nfiguring out what truth-makers and truth-bearers must be like in order\nto collectively realise the structure described by the axiom schemata\nfor truth-makers we favour. But there is nothing about these schemata\nthat demands truth-bearer and truth-maker be internally related.\n\nIt is striking that the Axiomatic approach to truth-making has proved\nless popular in the recent literature than other more\nmetaphysically-loaded conceptions, in terms of necessitation, essence\nor grounding. A principal attraction of the approach is its\nmetaphysical neutrality. By contrast, in more recent debate,\nphilosophers have preferred approaches which rely upon a distinctive\nmetaphysical vision.\n1.6 Truth-Making as Grounding\n\nMany recent approaches define truth-making in terms of\ngrounding or what is sometimes described as non-causal\nmetaphysical dependence. The notion of truth-making is typically\nintroduced, as we have seen, in terms of the ideology of \u201cin\nvirtue of\u201d. As we have also seen, many philosophers then ask:\nbut what independent content can be given to this notion? In response\nto this challenge, a theory of grounding may be conceived as a general\ntheory of \u201cin virtue of\u201d in terms of which truth-making\nmay then be explained. A further consideration which motivates those\nalready committed to grounding is the general methodological principle\nthat favours theoretical unification. Their idea is that by conceiving\nof truth-making as a kind of grounding, we are able to understand\ntruth-making better, i.e. not as an isolated phenomenon but as an\ninstance of a more general pattern, thereby illuminating not only the\nnature of truth-making but grounding too. \n\nEarly exponents of grounding within analytic philosophy date from the\n1960s (Bergmann 1961: 229, Hochberg 1967: 416\u20137). Recently,\ngrounding has been explained in a variety of different ways (Correia\nand Schnieder 2012, Raven 2015). But, broadly speaking, we can\ndistinguish between two conceptions which assign different logical\nforms to grounding statements: (1) the \u201cpredicate\u201d or\n\u201crelational\u201d view whereby grounding statements are\nassigned the logical form \u201cx grounds y\u201d\nwhere \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d mark singular\nterm positions and the verb expresses a relation; (2) the\n\u201coperator\u201d view whereby the canonical form of a grounding\nstatement is characterised by a sentence operator. So statements about\nsomething grounding something else have the logical form\n\u201cp because q\u201d where \u201cp\u201d\nand \u201cq\u201d mark positions for sentences. The predicate\nview of grounding is held by, amongst others, Schaffer 2009, Audi\n2012, Raven 2012; the operator view is advanced by Fine 2001, 2012,\nSchnieder 2006a, Correia 2011 [2014]. (A third approach, owed to Mulligan\n2007, recognises a plurality of different forms of grounding\nstatements.) The choice between (1) and (2) is often made either on\nthe basis of an assessment of the logical form of typical grounding\nclaims, or on the basis of ontological commitment, for example, the\nclaim that the operator approach to grounding is \u201contologically\nneutral\u201d because (allegedly) operators don\u2019t stand for\nanything as (allegedly) predicates do (Correia 2010: 254, Fine 2012:\n47).\n\nWe can now distinguish two broad conceptions of truth-making, defined,\nrespectively, in terms of the operator and predicate approach to\ngrounding.\n\n(Grounding-Predicate-T)\nA truth-maker is an entity x which makes a proposition\ny true iff the fact that x exists grounds the fact\nthat y is true. \n(Grounding-Operator-T)\n A truth-maker is an entity x which makes a proposition\ny true iff y is true because x exists.\n\n\n\nFor the former, see Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005, Schaffer 2009, Jago 2018:\n184\u2013202, for the latter, Correia 2005 (sec. 3.2), 2011 [2014],\nSchnieder 2006a, Mulligan 2007, Caputo 2007. \n\nOne attraction of conceiving truth-making as based on grounding, aside\nfrom the more general methodological virtues of theoretical\nunification mentioned above, arises from taking grounding to be\n\u201chyperintensional\u201d nature. Grounding is intended to be a\nnotion that\u2019s fine-grained enough to distinguish those entities,\ne.g., the cardinal numbers, that ground a necessary truth, such as\n2+2=4, from those that don\u2019t, e.g. a contingent existent such as\nthe aforementioned ice floe. Because grounding is so fine-grained\nneither Grounding-Predicate-T or\nGrounding-Operator-T will give rise to the over-generation\nthat beset Entailment-T and Necessitation-T but\nwithout having to appeal, like Projection-T, to an\nunderdeveloped notion of \u201cabout \u201d or\n\u201crelevance\u201d. \n\nOf course, in light of sec, 1.2 and 1.4 above, we can foresee a\ndownside to this. Both Grounding-Predicate-T and\nGrounding-Operator-T quantify over propositions that stand\nhyperintensionally to their truth-makers. It follows that both\nGrounding-Predicate-T and Grounding-Operator-T share\na commitment with Necessitarian-T and\nEssentialist-T, viz. an ontology of abstract propositions\nwhich have their meanings essentially. But, again, this may be a\ncommitment many grounding theorists have already made or be willing to\naccept if it gives them a good account of truth-making. Another issue\nis that there is no consensus upon the formal properties of grounding.\nWhilst, for example, Schaffer (2009: 376) has maintained that\ngrounding is irreflexive, asymmetric and transitive, Rodriguez-Pereyra\n(2015) has argued that the relation of truth-making isn\u2019t any of\nthese things. But Rodriguez-Pereyra also argues that grounding\nisn\u2019t any of those things either. \n\nSo far we have considered efforts to define truth-making in terms of\ngrounding. But there are other approaches in the literature which seek\nto endorse one notion at the expense of the other. One way accepts\ngrounding as a welcome theoretical innovation but argues that we are\nbetter off without truth-making, at least in the forms which have\nbecome familiar to us. A second way continues to endorse truth-making\nwhilst rejecting grounding. \n\nThe first approach, taken by Fine, involves embracing grounding but\nrejecting truth-making. It\u2019s truth-making, he argues, we can do\nwithout; grounding does a better job (Fine 2012; 43\u20136). Here\ntruth-making is conceived as a relation between a worldly entity and a\nrepresentation: the existence of the entity guarantees the truth of\nthe representation. But, Fine argues, it is more theoretically\nfruitful to take grounding as the central notion for metaphysics. This\nis partly because, Fine maintains, grounding is a less restrictive\nnotion than truth-making, because grounding does not require that the\nultimate source of what is true should lie in what exists, rather we\ncan remain open about what form grounding takes. Moreover, whilst\nthere may be genuine questions about what the ground is for the truth\nof the representation that p there may be further questions\nabout what makes it the case that p and these questions will\ntypically have nothing to do with representation as such. Because\ntruth-making is typically understood in modal terms, i.e.\nnecessitation is conceived to be sufficient for truth-making, Fine is\nalso sceptical that there is any way of avoiding the over-generation\nof truth-makers we have already discussed (see 1.1 and 1.2 above).\nFinally, Fine thinks that we should be able to conceive of the world\nhierarchically, whereby (e.g.) the normative is grounded in the\nnatural, the natural in the physical and the physical in the\nmicro-physical. But this is difficult to do if we think in terms of\ntruth-making, because if (e.g.) we conceive of a normative\nrepresentation being made true by the existence of something natural,\nthat natural thing is just the wrong sort of thing to be made true by\nsomething at the physical level because it is not a representation.\n\n\nLiggins (2012) maintains, like Fine, that the theory of truth-making\nis inevitably less general than a theory of grounding. But Liggins\nalso argues that appealing to grounding obviates the need to appeal to\ntruth-makers in the sense that (e.g.) Armstrong maintained. This is\nbecause one significant reason for positing truth-makers is that doing\nso enables us to explain the asymmetric sense in which truth depends\nupon being (see sec. 3.2 below). But, Liggins maintains, this can\nalready be done in terms of grounding, by saying that the fact that p\ngrounds the fact that a certain proposition is true, namely the\nproposition that p. According to Liggins, this isn\u2019t a case of\ntruth-making because the relation of grounding invoked holds solely\nbetween two facts, albeit one of them a fact about a proposition, that\nit is true, rather than, as Liggins reads the requirements of\ntruth-maker theory, a relation holding between something and a\nproposition. \n\nFine\u2019s critique of truth-making presupposes that we can only avail\nourselves of truth-making if we conceive of truth-making in monolithic\nterms, as providing a unique method for metaphysics. But whilst, for\nexample, Armstrong may have had a tendency to think in such terms,\nthis doesn\u2019t appear to be mandated by the nature of truth-making\nitself. One might, as Asay (2017) argues, instead conceive of\ngrounding and truth-making as complementary projects, whereby a theory\nof truth-making doesn\u2019t purport to do everything a theory of\ngrounding does and so reciprocal illumination remains a live\npossibility. Indeed one might already think of the aforementioned\ndefinitions or elucidations of truth-making, which are designed in\nterms of a hyperintensional notion of grounding in order to avoid\nover-generation of truthmakers as one way in which grounding is\nalready being used to illuminate truth-making. \n\nThe second approach, outlined above, refusing grounding but favouring\ntruth-making, is advanced by Heil (2016). Heil is generally suspicious\nof grounding because, he points out, grounding is often characterized\nin different and incompatible ways, so he is sceptical that there is a\nunivocal concept of grounding to be had. But, more specifically, Heil\nhas long maintained that hierarchical conceptions of reality spell\ntrouble because of the difficulties explaining the causal and\nnomological relationship between the layers (Heil 2003: 31\u20139). He\nargues that this was the problem identified for supervenience and\nrealization in the \u201890s and it\u2019s a problem inherited by the\nhierarchical conception of reality to which grounding gives rise. So\nHeil does a modus tollens where Fine does a modus ponens. Whilst Fine\nconceives of the hierarchical styles of explanation grounding provides\nas one of the principal virtues of grounding, Heil considers this is\none of the deepest drawbacks of grounding. By contrast with Fine, Heil\ninstead recommends truth-making as the proper methodology for\nmetaphysics because it enables us to give a non-hierarchical\ndescription of reality whereby fundamental physics gives us the\ntruth-makers for truths that have truth-makers. Further and\nindependent objections to grounding include whether the notion of\ngrounding is intelligible (Daly 2012), theoretically unified (MacBride\n2013b), theoretically illuminating (Wilson 2014) or the result of a\ncognitive illusion (Miller and Norton 2017).\n\nOther available positions include: that truth making is a special kind\nof grounding which involves a unique form of dependence (Griffith\n2013), and that truth making isn\u2019t grounding but that grounding\nis key to truthmaking (Saenz 2018). \n2. Which range of truths are eligible to be made true (if any are)?\n\nEven when truth-maker panegyrists agree about what it is to be a\ntruth-maker, they often still disagree about the range of truths that\nare eligible to be made true. This results in further disagreement\nabout what kinds of entities truth-makers are. There is potential for\ndisagreement here because of the appearance that different ranges of\ntruths require different kinds of truth-makers. Sometimes, discovering\nthemselves unable to countenance the existence of one or other kind of\ntruth-maker, panegyrists may find themselves obliged to reconsider\nwhat truths really require truth-makers or to reconsider what it is to\nbe a truth-maker. We can get a sense of the complex interplay of\nforces at work here by starting out from the most simple and general\nprinciple about truth-making (maximalism) and then seeing what\npressures are generated to make us step back from it.\n2.1 Maximalism\n\nTruth-maker maximalists demand that every truth has a\ntruth-maker\u2014no exceptions granted. So they advance the\ncompletely general principle,\n\n(Maximalism) \nFor every truth, then there must be something in the world that\nmakes it true.\n\n\nThe principle lies at one end of the spectrum of positions we can\npotentially occupy. At the other end, we find truth-maker\nnihilism, the idea that no truth needs to be made true because\n(roughly) the very idea of a truth-maker is a corrupt one: there is no\nsuch role as making something true for anything to perform.\nTruth-maker optimalism is the intermediate position that only\nsome truths stand in need of truth-makers: not so few that truth fails\nto be anchored in reality but not so many that we strain credulity\nabout the kinds of things there are.\n2.1.1 The Liar?\n\nMilne (2005) has offered the following knock-down, if not knock-out,\nargument against maximalism. Take the sentence,\n\n(M)\n This sentence has no truth-maker.\n\n\nSuppose that (M) has a truth-maker. Since it\u2019s made\ntrue, M must be true. And since it\u2019s true, what\n(M) says must also be the case: that M has no\ntruth-maker. So if (M) has a truth-maker then it\ndoesn\u2019t have a truth-maker. By reductio ad absurdum\n(M) therefore has no truth-maker. But this is just what\n(M) says. So, contra (Maximalism), there is at least\none sentence, (M), that is true without benefit of a\ntruth-maker.\n\nRodriguez-Pereyra (2006c) has responded to this argument by\nmaintaining that (M) is like the Liar sentence\n\n(L)\n This sentence is false.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a familiar position in the philosophy of logic to respond\nto the inconsistency that arises from supposing that (L) is\neither true or false\u2014if it is, it isn\u2019t and if it\nisn\u2019t, it is\u2014that the sentence (L)\nisn\u2019t meaningful, despite superficial appearances (see, for a\nuseful introduction to these issues, Sainsbury 1995: 111\u201333).\nAccording to Rodriguez-Pereyra, because (M) is akin to the\nLiar sentence there\u2019s no reason to suppose that (M) is\nmeaningful either. But if (M) isn\u2019t meaningful then\n(M) certainly can\u2019t be true; in which case (M)\ncan\u2019t be a counterexample to maximalism either.\n\nThis response is flawed because, as Milne points out, (M) is\nimportantly unlike (L): (L) gives rise to an\noutright inconsistency when only elementary logic rules are applied to\nit; whereas (M) isn\u2019t inconsistent per se but\nonly when combined with a substantive metaphysical principle:\nmaximalism. If, by contrast, you don\u2019t believe in truth-makers\nthen you have every right to treat (M) as just another true\nsentence\u2014just as you have every right to think (P) is\ntrue if you don\u2019t believe in propositions,\n\n(P)\n This sentence does not express a proposition\n\n\nIt\u2019s only if one was (absurdly) to think that maximalism was a\nlogical truth that (M) could be intelligibly thought to be\n\u201cLiar-like\u201d. Of course, one person\u2019s modus\nponens is another\u2019s modus tollens. So if one\nalready had very strong independent reasons for being committed to\nmaximalism, Milne\u2019s argument would provide a reason for thinking\nthat (M) is meaningless (even though it isn\u2019t\nLiar-like). But even if there are such reasons\u2014or appear to\nbe\u2014we can\u2019t claim to have control of our subject matter\nuntil we have established what it is about the constitutive\nconnections that obtain between truth-making, truth and truth-bearers\nthat determines (M) to be meaningless (if it is); until\nwe\u2019ve established the lie of the land, we can\u2019t be sure\nthat we\u2019re not kidding ourselves thinking (M) to be\nmeaningless rather than maximalism to be false. The lesson repeats\nitself: a convincing theory of truth-makers requires a coeval theory\nof truth bearers.\n\nFor further discussion of the Liar Paradox in relation to\ntruth-making, see Milne 2013 and Barrio and Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2015.\n2.1.2 Could there be nothing rather than something?\n\nHere\u2019s another shot across the bows, this time from Lewis. Take\nthe most encompassing negative existential of all: absolutely nothing\nexists. Surely this statement is possibly true. But if it were true\nthen something would have to exist to make it true if the principle\nthat every truth has a truth-maker is to be upheld. But then there\nwould have to be something rather than nothing. So combining\nmaximalism with the conviction that there could have been nothing\nrather than something leads to contradiction (Lewis 1998: 220, 2001:\n611). So unless we already have reason to think there must be\nsomething rather than nothing\u2014as both Armstrong (1989b:\n24\u20135) and Lewis (1986: 73\u20134) think they\ndo\u2014maximalism is already in trouble.\n2.1.3 Maximalism is distinct from 1\u20131 Correspondence\n\nWhat is there to be said in defence of maximalism? Even though he\nfavours it, Armstrong finds himself obliged to admit that \u201cI do\nnot have any direct argument\u201d for recommending the position\n(2004: 7). Instead he expresses the hope that \n\n\nphilosophers of realist inclinations will be immediately attracted to\nthe idea that a truth, any truth, should depend for its truth for\nsomething \u201coutside\u201d it, in virtue of which it is true.\n\n\n\nLet us follow Armstrong\u2019s lead and treat maximalism as a\n\u201chypothesis to be tested\u201d. (See Schaffer 2008b: 308 for a\nmore direct argument that relies upon (Grounding-T).)\n\nMaximalism needs to be distinguished from the even stronger claim,\n\n(Correspondence) \nFor each truth there is exactly one thing that makes it true and\nfor each truth-maker there is exactly one truth made true by it.\n\n\nBut that there\u2019s clear blue water between these claims is\nevident if we combine maximalism with (Entailment)\u2014that\nwhatever makes a truth p true makes what p entails\ntrue too. So p and all of its consequences are not only all\nmade true (as maximalism demands) but they also share a truth-maker\n(as Correspondence denies). This takes us halfway to\nappreciating that so far from being an inevitably profligate\ndoctrine\u2014as its name suggests\u2014maximalism is compatible\nwith denying that some logically complex claims have their own bespoke\ntruth-makers. (The inspiration for thinking this way comes from the\nlogical atomism of Russell (1918\u201319) that admitted some\nlogically complex facts but not others\u2014it is to be contrasted\nwith Wittgenstein\u2019s version of the doctrine (1921) which\nadmitted only atomic facts.)\n\nSuppose, for the sake of expounding the view, that some truth-bearers\nare atomic. Also suppose that P and Q are atomic and\nt makes P true. Then, by Entailment,\nt makes P \u2228 Q true too. Similarly, if\ns makes P true and s* makes Q true\nthen, by Entailment, s and s* together make\nP & Q true. Since the task of making P\n\u2228 Q and P & Q true has already been\ndischarged by the truth-makers for the atomic truth bearers, there is\nno need to posit additional truth-makers for making these disjunctive\nand conjunctive truths true. Similar reasoning suggests that there is\nno need to posit bespoke truth-makers for existential generalisations\nor truths of identity either (Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 313;\nSimons 1992: 161\u20133; Armstrong 2004: 54\u20135). But maximalism\nis not thereby compromised: even though disjunctive and conjunctive\ntruths lack specific truth-makers of their own, they\u2019re still\nmade true by the truth-makers of the basic claims from which\nthey\u2019re compounded by the logical operations of disjunction and\nconjunction.\n2.1.4 The need for bespoke truth-makers\n\nBut positing truth-makers for atomic truths doesn\u2019t obviate the\nneed\u2014supposing maximalism\u2014to posit additional truth-makers\nfor negative and universal truths. This becomes apparent in the case\nof negative truths when we compare the truth-tables for conjunction\nand disjunction with the truth-table for negation. The former tell us\nthat the truth of a disjunctive formula is determined by the truth of\none or other of its disjuncts, whilst the truth of a conjunctive\nformula is determined by the truth of both its conjuncts. But the\ntruth-table for negation doesn\u2019t tell us how the truth of\n~P is determined by the truth of some other atomic formula\nQ from which ~P follows; it only tells us that\n~P is true iff P is false. The strategy for\navoiding bespoke truth-makers for logically complex truths can\u2019t\nget a grip in this case: there\u2019s no Q such that\nsupplying a truth-maker for it obviates the necessity of positing an\nadditional truth-maker for ~P (Russell 1918\u201319:\n209\u201311; Hochberg 1969: 325\u20137).\n\nThe problem is even starker for universal truths: there\u2019s no\ntruth-table for them because there is no set of atomic formulae whose\ntruth determines that a universally quantified formula is true too.\nWhy so? Because whatever true atomic formulae we light upon\n(Fa, Fb\u2026 Fn), it doesn\u2019t\nfollow from them that \u2200xFx is true. To extract the\ngeneral conclusion one would need to add to the premises that\na, b\u2026 n are all the things\nthere are; that there\u2019s no extra thing waiting in the wings to\nappear on stage that isn\u2019t F. But this extra premise is\nitself universally quantified, not atomic. So it can\u2019t be argued\nthat the truth-makers for Fa, Fb\u2026 Fn\nput together already discharge the task of making \u2200xFx\ntrue because they entail it (Russell 1918\u20139: 236\u20137;\nHochberg 1969: 335\u20137).\n2.1.4.1 Truth-makers for Negative Truths\n\nThe most straightforward response\u2014since we are treating\nmaximalism as a working hypothesis\u2014is to find more fitting\ntruth-makers for those truths that aren\u2019t already made true by\nthe truth-makers for the atomic truths that entail them. Whilst\nlooking around for truth-makers for negative truths Russell reflected,\n\n\n\nThere is implanted in the human breast an almost unquenchable desire\nto find some way of avoiding the admission that negative facts are as\nultimate as those that are positive. (1919: 287)\n\n\nHe was right that our desire for positive facts and things makes us\nawkward about acknowledging that negative facts or things are the\ntruth-makers of negative truths. Nonetheless, discussions about\nwhether there are truth-makers for a given range of truth bearers on\none or the other side of the positive-negative divide are apt to\nappear nebulous. This is because, as Russell had himself previously\nnoted, there is \u201cno formal test\u201d or \u201cgeneral\ndefinition\u201d for being a negative fact; we \u201cmust go into\nthe meanings of words\u201d (1918\u201319: 215\u20136). Statements\nof the form \u201ca is F\u201d aren\u2019t\ninvariably positive (\u201cso-and-so is dead\u201d), nor are\nstatements of the form \u201ca isn\u2019t F\u201d\n(\u201cso-and-so isn\u2019t blind\u201d) always negative. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from the fact that a syntactic test cannot be\ngiven that there is nothing to the contrast between positive and\nnegative. Molnar suggests that the contrast can be put on a sound\nscientific footing. For Molnar, natural kinds are paradigm instances\nof the positive, to be identified on a posteriori grounds\n(2000: 73). To say that a thing belongs to a natural kind identified\nin this way is to state a positive fact. To state a negative fact is\nto negate a statement of a positive fact.\n\nIt\u2019s a very natural suggestion that if the negative claim that\na isn\u2019t F is true it\u2019s made true by the\nexistence of something positive that\u2019s incompatible\nwith a\u2019s being F (Demos 1917). For example,\nthe truth-maker for the claim that kingfishers aren\u2019t yellow is\nthe fact that they\u2019re blue because their being blue is\nincompatible with their being yellow. But what makes it true that\nthese colours are incompatible? The notion of incompatibility\nappears itself to be negative\u2014a relation that obtains between\ntwo states when it\u2019s not possible for them to obtain\ntogether. So this proposal threatens to become regressive: we\u2019ll\nneed to find another positive truth-maker for the further negative\nclaim that yellow and blue are incompatible, something whose obtaining\nis incompatible with the state of yellow and blue\u2019s being\ncompatible, and so on (Russell 1918\u20139: 213\u20135, 1919:\n287\u20139; Taylor 1952: 438\u201340; Hochberg 1969: 330\u20131;\nGrossman 1992: 130\u20131; Molnar 2000: 74\u20135; Simons 2008).\nThere\u2019s another worry: it\u2019s not obvious that there are\nenough positive states out there to underwrite all the negative truths\nthere are. Even though it may be true that this liquid is odourless\nthis needn\u2019t be because there\u2019s something further about it\nthat excludes its being odorous (Taylor 1952: 447; Mulligan, Simons,\n& Smith 1984: 314; Molnar 2000: 75; Armstrong 2004: 62\u20133;\nDodd 2007: 387).\n\nOne could circumvent the threatened regress by denying that the\nincompatibilities in question require truth-makers of their own\nbecause they\u2019re necessary truths and such truths are a\nlegitimate exception to maximalism\u2014because \u201cthey are true\ncome (or exist) what may\u201d (Simons 2005: 254; Mellor 2003: 213).\nThere is some plausibility to the idea that formal truths\n(tautologies) don\u2019t stand in need of truth-makers; their truth\nis settled by the truth-tables of the logical constants. But material\nnecessary truths\u2014such as that expressed by \u201cyellow is\nincompatible with blue\u201d\u2014appear to make just as substantive\ndemands upon the world as contingent truths do (Molnar 2000: 74). In a\nsense they appear to make even more of a demand since the world must\nbe so endowed that it could not in any circumstances have failed to\nlive up to the expectations of material necessary truths. It\u2019s a\npeculiar feature of our philosophical culture that even though\nit\u2019s almost universally acknowledged that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nplan (1921: 6.37) to show all necessity is logical necessity ended in\nfailure\u2014indeed foundered upon the very problem of explaining\ncolour incompatibilities\u2014that so many philosophers continue to\nthink and talk as though the only necessities were formal ones so that\nnecessary truths don\u2019t need truth-makers (MacBride 2011:\n176\u20137).\n\nRussell reluctantly chose to acknowledge negative facts as\ntruth-makers for negative truths. He just couldn\u2019t see any way\nof living without them. But negative facts are an unruly bunch. Try to\nthink of all the ways you are. Contrast that with the even harder task\nof thinking of all the ways you aren\u2019t! If negative truths are\nacknowledged as truth-makers they will have to be indefinitely\nnumerous, unbounded in their variety; choosing to live with them is a\nheavy commitment to make (Armstrong 2004: 55). What\u2019s worse, if\nnegative facts are akin to positive facts\u2014as their name\nsuggests\u2014then they must be made up out of things, properties and\nrelations arranged together. But, prima facie, many of these\nthings, properties and relations aren\u2019t existing elements of\nreality. So unless, like Meinong, we believe in the non-existent,\nwe\u2019ll have to admit that negative facts aren\u2019t\nconfigurations of their constituents and so an entirely different kind\nof entity from positive facts altogether (Molnar 2000: 77; Dodd 2007:\n388).\n\nIt is for such reasons that Armstrong counsels us to adopt a more\nparsimonious account of what makes negative truths true (2004:\n56\u20139). Armstrong\u2019s own account lies at the opposite\nextreme to Russell\u2019s. Whereas Russell posited indefinitely\nmany negative facts to make negative truths true, Armstrong\nposits just one thing that\u2019s responsible for making\nthem all true, viz. a totality fact.\n\nWe should register C.B. Martin\u2019s doubt that this is throwing out\nthe baby with the bath water (1996: 59). According to Martin, we\nalready recognise in ordinary discourse that different negative truths\nhave different truth-makers\u2014not just one as Armstrong proposes.\nFor example, we recognise that what makes it true that there is no oil\nin this engine is different from what makes it true that there are no\ndodos left. What makes claims like these true are absences, lacks,\nlimits, holes and voids, where these are conceived not as things but\nas \u201clocalised states of the world\u201d, robustly\nfirst-order and \u201ccausally relevant\u201d to what goes on\n(Martin 1996: 58, 65\u20136; Taylor 1952: 443\u20135). But, as many\nphilosophers have argued, when we talk about an absence having causal\neffects what we\u2019re really saying can be understood without\nreifying negative states and appealing instead to the actual effects,\nor the counterfactual effects, of a positive state (Molnar 2000:\n77\u201380; Armstrong 2004: 64\u20137; Lewis 2004; Beebee 2004).\n\n2.1.4.2 Truth-makers for general truths\n\nArmstrong\u2019s grand design is to sweep away the difficulties that\nattend the admission of negative facts by positing a special kind of\ngeneral fact that also serves as the truth-maker for general truths.\nRussell admitted general facts too but he acknowledged that, \u201cI\ndo not profess to know what the right analysis of general facts\nis\u201d (Russell 1918\u20139: 236\u20137). But Armstrong has gone\nfurther and assigned to general facts the following structure: a\ngeneral, or totality fact consists in a binary relation T of\ntotality that holds between an aggregate on the one hand and\na property on the other when the aggregate comprises all the\nitems that fall under the property in question (Armstrong 1989b:\n93\u20134, 1997: 199\u2013200, 2004: 72\u20135).\n\nFor example, China, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and the\nU.S.A. comprise the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.\nSo the aggregate (A) of them bears the T relation to\nthe property (P) of being a permanent member of the Council\n(T(A, P)). Since the aggregate bears that\nrelation to that property, there can be other permanent members of the\nCouncil who aren\u2019t already included in it. So the totality fact\nT(A, P) suffices for the general truth that\nChina, France, the Russian Federation, the U.K. and the U.S.A are\nall its members. It also suffices for the truth of the\nnegative existential that there are no other members of the\nCouncil. So once we\u2019ve recognised that T(A, P)\nexists, there\u2019s no need to recognise additional bespoke\ntruth-makers for these negative truths.\n\nIn a similar way Armstrong endeavours to sweep away the need for\nnegative facts by affirming \u201cthe biggest totality state of all,\nthe one embracing all lower-order states of affairs\u201d, i.e., the\nexistence of a totality state that consists in an aggregate of all the\n(1st order) states of affairs there are related by\nT to the property of being a (1st order)\nstates of affairs (2004: 75). It\u2019s one of Armstrong\u2019s\nabiding contentions that the world is \u201ca world of states of\naffairs, with particulars and universals only having existence within\nstates of affairs\u201d (1989: 94). Consequently this totality state\ncomprises a vast swathe of what exists\u2014whether particulars,\nuniversals or states of affairs that consist in particulars having\nuniversals. So it follows from the existence of this totality fact\nthat there are no more (1st order) states of affairs that\nare not already included in the aggregate of states that T\nrelates to the property of being a (1st order) states\nof affairs. Nor are there any particulars or (1st\norder) universals had by those particulars that are not constituents\nof the state of affairs included in that aggregate. It also follows\nthat there are no more particulars or (1st order)\nuniversals. So this totality fact serves as truth-maker for all these\nnegative truths.\n\nIt is sometimes objected that such totality facts are just negative\nfacts in disguise: \u201cTotality statements state the non-existence\nof certain entities, they state \u2018no more facts\u2019\u201d; so\nwe should reject totality facts if we are dissatisfied with negative\nones (Molnar 2000: 81\u20132; Dodd 2007: 389). Armstrong responds to\nthis charge with equanimity: \u201cIt is not denied, of course, that\nthe totalling or alling relation involves negation. It sets a limit to\nthe things of that sort\u201d (2004: 73). But if negation has indeed\nbeen smuggled into the description of the role that T\nperforms in comprising a totality state then it is difficult to avoid\nthe suspicion that Armstrong has simply exchanged many negative facts\nfor one big one. But we may think of Armstrong\u2019s contribution in\na different way. There are two ostensible concerns that negative\nstates of affairs present. First, there is a concern about their\nnumber. Second, there is a concern about, so to speak, their\nnegativity. Armstrong has addressed the first concern by\nshowing how we may reduce the number of negative states of affairs.\nBut the second concern neither cannot be met\u2014because, as\nArmstrong reflects, we cannot eliminate negation from our description\nof the world.\n\nIt has also been objected that Armstrong\u2019s position gives rise\nto a \u201cparadox of totality\u201d (Armstrong 1989: 94, 1997:\n198\u20139, 2004: 78\u20139; Cox 1997: 53\u201360; Molnar 2000:\n81). Take the totality state of affairs that comprises all the\n(1st order) state of affairs. Since this (2nd\norder) state is itself a state of affairs it follows that the initial\naggregate of (1st order) states of affairs failed to\ncomprise all the states of affairs there are. So there must be a\nfurther totality state that comprised the aggregate of all of them.\nBut this (3rd order) state is also a state of affairs so it\nwill need to be added to the mix too, and so ad\ninfinitum.\n\nArmstrong responds to this objection with equanimity too: \n\n\nwe can afford to be casual about this infinite series. For after the\nfirst fact of totality these \u201cextra\u201d states of affairs are\nall supervenient. As such, we do not have to take them with\nontological seriousness. (1989b: 94)\n\n\nTo understand this we need to appreciate that Armstrong\u2019s notion\nof supervenience is non-standard: \u201can entity Q\nsupervenes upon entity P if and only if it is impossible that\nP should exist and Q not exist\u201d or, in other words that\nthe existence of P entails the existence of Q.\n(Armstrong 1997: 11). He also holds a non-standard conception of\nontological commitment, viz. that \u201cWhat supervenes is\nno addition of being\u201d (Armstrong 1997: 12, 2004: 23\u20134).\nArmstrong\u2019s idea is (roughly) that to be a genuine addition to\nbeing is to be a net (indispensable) contributor to the schedule of\ntruth-makers for all the truths. But supervenient entities are\nsuperfluous as truth-makers. If the existence of an R entails\nthe existence of a certain S which in turn entails the truth\nof P, then R already makes P true so there\nis no need to include S in the inventory of truth-makers. It\nfollows that supervenient entities, like S, are no addition\nof being (Lewis 1992: 202\u20133).\n\nNow bring this non-standard conception of ontological commitment to\nbear upon the envisaged infinite series of totality facts. It is\nimpossible that the 2nd order totality fact comprising all\nthe 1st order states of affairs exist and the 3rd order\ntotality fact comprising all the 1st and 2nd\norder states not exist. So the 3rd totality fact\u2014or\nany other state higher-order than it\u2014is entailed by the\nexistence of the 2nd order totality state. So all of these\nn > 2 higher-order totality states supervene on it.\nThat\u2019s why Armstrong doesn\u2019t think we need to take any of\nthem with ontological seriousness.\n\nWhat should we make of this non-standard conception of ontological\ncommitment in terms of truth-making: that to be is to be a\ntruth-maker? Cameron (2008c) has proposed that this conception should\nreplace the standard one that to be is to be the value of a\nvariable. But this threatens to cut off the branch the advocates of\ntruth-maker theory are sitting on: if they disavow that existential\nquantification is ontologically committing then they will be left\nwithout a means of determining the ontological commitments of\ntruth-maker theory itself, i.e., the theory that gives the inventory,\nusing existential quantification, of what makes all the truths true\n(Schaffer 2010: 16\u20137).\n\nOf course, if someone grants that existential quantification is\nontologically committing in the context of a theory of\ntruth-makers then they won\u2019t stultify themselves in this way\n(Heil 2003: 9, 2009: 316\u20137, Simons 2010: 200). But this just\nseems like special pleading. An argument is owed that we can\u2019t\nlegitimately commit ourselves to the existence of things that perform\ntheoretical roles outside the theory of truth-makers (MacBride 2011:\n169). Why should there be only one theoretical dance allowed in town?\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we allow that there are other theoretical roles\nfor existing things to perform? Indeed it\u2019s a very real\npossibility that when we come to understand the capacity of the\ntruth-makers to make truth-bearers true we will find ourselves\nembroiled in commitment to the existence of other things in their\nexplanatory wake that aren\u2019t truth-makers themselves. In fact\nArmstrong himself should have been one of the first to recognise this.\nFor it has been an abiding feature of Armstrong\u2019s world view\nthat we are obliged to acknowledge not only states affairs, which are\ntruth makers, but also properties and relations, constituents of\nstates of affairs, which aren\u2019t.\n\nMore generally, can we make any sense of the idea of \u201can\nontological free lunch\u201d? Why is something supervenient no\naddition to being? Even if we only ever came to recognise the\nexistence of one supervening entity would we not thereby have\nadded at least one extra item to our inventory of things that\nexist? Of course in the special case where the supervening entity is\nconstituted by the entities it supervenes upon\u2014i.e.,\nthe things that are already there\u2014it makes some sense to say\nthat it\u2019s not adding anything new; but it\u2019s not at all\nobvious that what Armstrong et al. declare to be ontological free\nlunches are constituted from the entities upon which they supervene\n(Melia 2005: 74\u20135). Accordingly Schulte (2011a, 2011b) argues\nthat no necessitarian or grounding account of truth-making can make\nsense of the notion of an ontological free lunch, maintaining instead\nthat truthmaker theory needs to be augmented with the idea that we are\noffering a reductive explanation when we make an explanation in terms\nof truthmakers\n\nWhere does this leave us? So long as Armstrong\u2019s non-standard\nconception of ontological commitment remains controversial, it also\nremains controversial whether the infinite series of totality facts to\nwhich Armstrong is \u201ccommitted\u201d may be dismissed as mere\nontological frippery.\n2.2 Optimalism\n\nOne way to respond to these difficulties is to abandon maximalism in\nfavour of optimalism, to deny that universal and negative statements\nneed truth-makers. But Merricks argues the optimalist \u201cway\nout\u201d is blocked. Negative truths need truth-makers if any truths\ndo, but they can\u2019t have them. So we must give up thinking that\ntruths need truth-makers in the first place (2007: 39\u201367).\n\nHere\u2019s why Merricks thinks so. In order to avoid the\nover-generation of truth-makers for necessary truths (etc.)\nMerricks imposes a relevance constraint: \u201ca truth-maker must be\nthat which its truth is about\u201d (2007: 28). But can this\nconstraint be satisfied in the case of negative existentials, such as\nthe statement there are no hobbits? This statement isn\u2019t about\nhobbits, because there aren\u2019t any, and other apparent\ncandidates, such as the universe\u2019s exhibiting the global\nproperty of being such that there are no hobbits in it,\nappear hoaxed up and artificial (2007: 43\u201355). Even if one\nfollows Merricks this far, one may still think that negative\nexistentials are the principled exception that proves the rule that a\ntruth-maker for a positive truth must be what its truth is about. But,\nso far as Merricks is concerned, this is throwing the baby out with\nthe bathwater: \n\n\nI deny that if we set aside the intuition that \u201ca truth, any\ntruth\u201d depends on being we are left with the equally compelling\nintuition that all truths except negative existentials depend\non being. (2007: 41) \n\n\nHe also suggests that this position is theoretically disingenuous\nbecause no one would consider retreating to it from full-blown\nmaximalism unless he or she had already been \u201cspooked\u201d by\nhis or her failure to find truth-makers for negative truths; or if\nthey held onto the view that truth is correspondence (Merricks 2007:\n40\u20131; Dodd 2007: 394; Cameron 2008a: 411). Merricks surmises\nthat if we have any reason to commit to truth-makers, we have only\nreason to commit outright to a truth-maker for every truth\n(maximalism). But since maximalism cannot be sustained because of the\nlack of things for negative existentials to be about, Merricks\nrecommends the rejection of truth-makers altogether.\n\nBut optimalists aren\u2019t just \u201cspooked\u201d or\n\u201ctimid\u201d maximalists. They stand on their two feet with a\nprincipled position of their own that need neither be based upon\n\u201cgerrymandered intuition\u201d nor adopted as a consequence of\na forced retreat from maximalism. If maximalism is intellectual heir\nto Russell\u2019s logical atomism, then optimalism (at least in the\nform under consideration) is heir to Wittgenstein\u2019s version of\nthe doctrine according to which it is only atomic propositions that\nrepresent the existence of states of affairs. The optimalists\u2019\nidea is that once truth-makers have been supplied for the atomic\ntruths there is simply no need to posit further truth-makers\nfor the molecular ones. All we need to recognise is that an atomic\nstatement P is true whenever a truth-maker for P\nexists, that P is false if and only if no truth-maker for\nP exists. Once the existence and non-existence of the\ntruth-makers has settled the truth-values of all the atomic\nstatements, the logical operations described by the truth-tables then\nsettle the truth and falsity of all the molecular statements (another\nstory must be told about what the truth-makers are for the\nnon-extensional constructions\u2014another elephant in the room). In\nparticular, the truth-table for negation\u2014that tells us what\n\u201c~\u201d means\u2014assures us that if P is false\nthen ~P is true. So all it takes to make ~P true is\nthat no truth-maker for P exists. Thus Mulligan, Simons, and\nSmith: \n\n\nit seems more adequate to regard sentences of the given kind as true\nnot in virtue of any truth-maker of their own, but simply in virtue of\nthe fact that the corresponding positive sentences have no\ntruth-maker. (1984: 315; see also Mellor 2003: 213\u20134, 2009;\nSimons 2000:7\u20138, 2005: 255\u20136)\n\n\nSimons offers the illuminating reflection: \n\n\nThis is the truth-maker end of Wittgenstein\u2019s insight that\npropositions are bi-polar: if a proposition has one truth-value,\nhowever it gets it, its contradictory opposite has the opposite\ntruth-value without further ado; \n\n\nSimons dubs the truth functional mechanism whereby the negation of an\natomic statement gets the value true, \u201ctruth by default\u201d\n(2008: 14).\n\nOptimalists also think that general truths are true by default so\nthere is no need for bespoke truth-makers for them (like totality\nfacts). Universal quantifications \u2200xFx are logically\nequivalent to negative statements of the form\n\u223c\u2203x\u223cFx. Since the latter are negative,\nthey\u2019re true, if they are, only by default. Then because the\nformer statements are logically equivalent to them, the optimalists\nsurmise that universal quantifications are true by default too (Mellor\n2003: 214; Simons 2008: 14\u20135).\n\nFurther challenges for the optimalist or non-maximalist are discussed\nin Jago 2012, Simpson 2014, Jago 2018 (81\u2013102). \n2.3 Truth Supervenes Upon Being\n\nOptimalism retains the original demand for truth-makers but restricts\nit to atomic statements. Optimalism accordingly disavows a commitment\nto truth-makers for negative statements and statements of generality.\nBut Bigelow\u23afalso wary of the commitments that maximalism\nengenders to negative and totality facts\u23af weakens what\ntruth-making means to a point where negative and general statements\ndon\u2019t require bespoke truth-makers of their own (1988:\n131\u20133). He offers the following principle to capture the kernel\nof truth in truth-making worth saving.\n\n(Truth Supervenes on Being) \nIf something is true then it would not be possible for it to be\nfalse unless either certain things were to exist which don\u2019t, or\nelse certain things had not existed which do (1988: 133).\n\n\nThis principle allows atomic truths to have truth-makers\u23afbecause\nit would only be possible for them to be false if certain things had\nnot existed: their truth-makers. But it also allows negative truths to\nbe true without them. The statement that there are no dragons gets to\nbe true because it would only be possible for that statement to be\nfalse if something which hadn\u2019t existed (dragons) did exist.\nSuch statements are true not because they have truth-makers but\nbecause they have no counterexamples, \u201cthey lack\nfalse-makers\u201d (Lewis 1992: 216, 2001: 610).\n\nGeneral truths are also true for lack of false-makers. The statement\nthat everything is physical (if true) is true because it would only be\npossible for the statement to be false if something that hadn\u2019t\nexisted did, viz. something that wasn\u2019t physical. So\nwhen truth-making is understood in this weakened sense there is no\nneed to acknowledge, e.g., an additional totality fact to make it true\nthat there are only five coins in my pocket; it\u2019s enough that if\nI hadn\u2019t stopped adding coins that statement would have been\nfalse because then there would have been at least one other coin in my\npocket (Heil 2000: 236\u2013240, 2003: 68\u201372, 2006:\n238\u201340; Bricker 2006).\n\nDespite their differences, optimalism and (Truth Supervenes Upon\nBeing) share a key idea in common\u2014that a negative\nexistential truth isn\u2019t true because something exists, but\nbecause something doesn\u2019t, viz. a truth-maker for its\ncontradictory, a false-maker for it. C.B. Martin has objected that\nthis doesn\u2019t obviate the need to posit truth-makers for negative\nexistentials. This is because a statement that there are no\nfalse-makers for a negative existential truth is itself a negative\nexistential truth. So this statement \u201ccan\u2019t be used to\nexplain or show how the latter needs no truth-making state of the\nworld for it to be true\u201d (1996: 61). Lewis takes Martin\u2019s\nobjection to be that this account of the truth of negative truths\nisn\u2019t informative. Take the statement that there are no\nunicorns. Why is it true? Well because there are no\nunicorns. That\u2019s not much of an explanation! But, Lewis retorts,\nthe positive existential statement that there is a cat is true because\nthere is a cat. That\u2019s \u201cNo explanation at all, and none\nthe worse for that\u201d (Lewis 2001: 611\u201312). Fair enough; but\nperhaps Martin meant that optimalists and their fellow-travellers were\npresupposing what they set out to show\u2014because they assumed\nwithout argument that a special class of negative claims stood in no\nneed of truth-makers, those according to which other negative\nstatements lacked false makers.\n2.4 Humean Scepticism\n\nLewis has anyway argued that the doctrine that truth supervenes upon\nbeing\u2014and, by implication, optimalism\u2014are an uncomfortable\nhalfway house. He began by trying to persuade us that the retreat from\nmaximalism was already mandated. He pointed out how deeply\ncounterintuitive it is to suppose that negative existentials are true\nbecause their truth-makers exist. It seems, offhand, that they are\ntrue not because some things do exist but because some don\u2019t.\n\u201cWhy defy this first impression?\u201d (1992: 204). But, more\nimportantly, Lewis pointed out that maximalism was incompatible with\nwhat he took to be the master principle governing our thought about\nmodality: Hume\u2019s denial of necessary connection between distinct\nexistences. It is a consequence of this principle that anything can\nco-exist with anything else that\u2019s distinct. But it is the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of any truth-maker for the negative\nexistential truth that there are no unicorns\u2014if there is one and\nwhatever else it is like\u2014that even though it is distinct from\nall unicorns it cannot co-exist with any of them, else it would make\nit true that there are no unicorns even in circumstances where\nunicorns existed. Similarly it is the raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre of any truth-maker for a general truth that\nsuch-and-such are all the facts there are that it refuses to co-exist\nwith any other facts even though it is distinct from them. So if\nwe\u2019re to hang onto Hume\u2019s denial of necessary connexions,\nwe\u2019d better give up the demand for truth-makers for negative and\ngeneral truths, i.e., maximalism (Lewis 1992: 205, 2001:\n610\u201311).\n\nLewis also argues that we can\u2019t stop here\u2014just giving up\nmaximalism for optimalism\u2014because even the truth-makers for\natomic statements conflict with Humeanism. Suppose that the statement\nthat Dog Harry is golden is atomic. Also suppose that Harry is only\naccidentally golden, so the statement is contingent. What is its\ntruth-maker? It can\u2019t be Harry because it\u2019s possible for\nhim to exist even in circumstances where the statement is false, i.e.,\nwhen he has a different coloured coat. But it can\u2019t be the\nproperty of being golden either since there are possible\ncircumstances in which plenty of things are golden but not Harry. It\ncan\u2019t even be the mereological fusion Harry + being\ngolden because it\u2019s a feature of fusions that they exist\neven in circumstances where their parts are otherwise\nunrelated\u2014e.g., when Harry is black whilst Harriet is golden.\nFor this reason, many maximalists make common cause with optimalists\nto posit another fundamental kind of thing to perform the truth-making\nrole in the case of contingent (atomic) predications: facts that\nconsist in objects, properties and relations bound together; in this\ncase the fact Harry\u2019s being golden (Armstrong 1989a:\n41\u20132, 1997: 115\u20136; Mellor 1995: 24). Now facts in general\nand Harry\u2019s being golden in particular cannot be built\nup mereologically from Harry and being golden; otherwise\nHarry\u2019s being golden would be no more fit a candidate\nfor making the statement that Harry is golden true than the fusion\nHarry + being golden. Since Harry\u2019s being\ngolden isn\u2019t built up mereologically from Harry and\nbeing golden, they cannot be parts of it. But if they\naren\u2019t parts of it they must be entirely distinct from this\nstate of affairs. This is where Lewis pounced. Even though\nHarry\u2019s being golden is entirely distinct from its\n\u201cconstituents\u201d it cannot obtain without Harry and\nbeing golden existing. More generally, the obtaining of a\nfact necessitates the existence of its constituents even though the\nfact and its constituents are entirely distinct. So we cannot posit\nfacts as truth-makers for contingent (atomic) statements without going\nagainst Humeanism (Lewis 1992: 200, 1998: 215\u20136, 2001: 611).\n\nOther maximalists and optimalists, often those wary of facts, posit\n(non-transferrable) tropes as truth-makers for contingent predications\n(Martin 1980; Mulligan, Simons, & Smith 1984: 295\u2013304, Lowe\n2006: 186\u20137, 204\u20135) Tropes, in the non-transferrable\nsense, are particular instances of properties that are existentially\ndependent upon their bearers. For example, the particular golden\ncolour g of Harry\u2019s coat is a non-transferrable trope\nbecause g could not have existed except as the colour of\nhis coat. Since g is non-transferrable, this trope\nonly exists in circumstances where Harry\u2019s coat is golden; hence\ng\u2019s eligibility to be a truth-maker for the statement\nthat Harry is golden. (If g was transferrable, then\ng could have existed in circumstances where whilst borne by\nHarriet, Harry bore another black trope d; so if g\nis transferrable it isn\u2019t eligible to be a truth-maker for the\nstatement that Harry is golden.) But Lewis\u2019 reasoning can be\neasily extended to show that non-transferrable tropes cannot serve as\nthe truth-makers for contingent statements without contradicting\nHumeanism. If trope g is a property that Harry bears rather\nthan a part of him, then g is wholly distinct from Harry.\nNevertheless, the existence of g necessitates the existence\nof Harry even though they are distinct (MacBride 2005: 121).\nAlternatively if g is a part of the bundle of tropes that\nconstitute Harry, if g is non-transferrable, then the\nexistence of g necessitates the existence of some other\ndistinct tropes that are also parts of this bundle. So Humeanism is\nviolated either way.\n2.4.1 Subject Matter\n\nIn order to avoid contradicting Humeanism, Lewis recommended a further\nweakening of (Truth Supervenes upon Being). According to\nLewis, the kernel of truth in truth-making is the idea that\npropositions have a subject matter. They are about\nthings so whether they are true or false depends on how those things\nstand. This led Lewis to endorse (2003: 25):\n\n(Subject matter) \nAny proposition has a subject matter, on which its truth value\nsupervenes.\n\n\nEquivalently, there cannot be a difference in the truth-value of a\nproposition without a difference in its subject matter. This\nmight consist in (1) an increase or decrease in the population of\nthings that fall within the subject matter; or (2) a shift in the\npattern of fundamental properties and relations those things exhibit\n(Lewis 2001: 612). Now the truth value of \u201cHarry is\ngolden\u201d supervenes upon its subject matter without there needing\nto be any existing thing distinct from Harry or being golden\nthat necessitates their existence; it is enough that the statement\nwould have been false if Harry had lost his hair or been dyed. So we\ncan avoid contradicting Humeanism by abandoning optimalism in favour\nof (Subject matter).\n\nIn an intriguing twist to the plot, Lewis subsequently appeared to\nwithdraw his doubts about truth-makers (2003: 30, Lewis & Rosen\n2003: 39). When building the case for (Subject Matter) Lewis\nhad deliberately remained neutral about the metaphysics of modality\n(2001: 605). But Lewis recognised that if he gave up his neutrality\nand availed himself of counterpart theory then he could supply\ntruth-makers aplenty whilst still adhering to his Humeanism.\n\nAccording to Lewis\u2019s counterpart theory, \u201ca is\nessentially F just in case all of a\u2019s\ncounterparts (including a itself) are F\u201d\n(2003: 27). Counterparts of x are objects that are similar to\nx in certain salient respects. Different conversational\ncontexts make different respects salient. This means that the truth\n(or falsity) of essentialist judgements is always relative to the\ncounterpart relation conversational cues select; so it will often be\nthe case that whilst something is essentially F with respect\nto one counterpart relation it won\u2019t be with respect to another\n(Lewis 1968). In a conversation that makes it salient to think about\nHarry under the counterpart relation of being a golden\nLabrador then every relevant counterpart of him will be golden.\nSo relative to this counterpart relation he is essentially golden. But\nin a different conversation that selects the counterpart relation of\nbeing a dog because then whilst all of his counterparts will\nbe dogs Harry won\u2019t be essentially golden because some of his\ncounterparts will be other colours. What\u2019s important is that\nit\u2019s one and the same thing, our beloved Harry, that\u2019s\nessentially golden with respect to the former counterpart relation but\nonly accidentally so with respect to the latter. To make these\nessentialist judgements count as true in the right contexts we\ndon\u2019t need one dog that\u2019s essentially golden, and another\nthat\u2019s only accidentally so; we just need to think about Harry\nin two different (but compatible) ways.\n\nAccording to (Necessitarian-T) and other related views, the\nproperty a truth-maker x has of making a given proposition\nP true is an essential feature of it. Why so? Because\nx is supposed to be something the mere existence of which\nsuffices for the truth of P; it couldn\u2019t have existed\nwithout P being true (Armstrong 1997: 115). But Lewis\u2019\nproposal is to treat essentialist attributions about truth-making in\nthe same relativistic spirit that counterpart theory treats every\nother modal attribution (2003: 27\u201332). Think of Harry\nqua golden Labrador, i.e., under the counterpart relation of\nbeing a golden Labrador. All his counterparts selected by this\nrelation are golden. So every world in which Harry or one of the\ncounterparts exists is a world in which \u201cHarry is golden\u201d\nis true. In other words, Harry qua golden is truth-maker for\nthe proposition that Harry is golden. But this doesn\u2019t commit us\nto necessary connexions between distinct existences\u2014to a dog\nthat couldn\u2019t have failed to be golden. In another context it\nwill be just as legitimate to talk about Harry in a different way, as\nHarry qua dog. In that context his counterparts will include\ndogs that aren\u2019t golden. So Harry qua dog will be the\ntruth-maker for the statement that Harry is a dog, but not the\nstatement that he is golden.\n\nIn the same way that ordinary objects like Harry can serve as\ntruth-makers for contingent predications, Lewis & Rosen (2003)\nsuggest that the entire world\u2014\u201cthe totality of everything\nthere actually is\u201d\u2014can serve as the truth-maker for\nnegative existentials. Take the world qua unaccompanied by\nunicorns. In the conversational context just set up, the world has no\ncounterparts that are inhabited by unicorns. So the world qua\nunaccompanied by unicorns is essentially lacking in unicorns and\ntherefore qualifies as a truth-maker for the statement that there are\nno unicorns.\n\nHas Lewis shown how it is possible to garner truth-makers for\ncontingent predications and negative existentials without positing\ntotality facts or tropes that ensnare us in a web of necessary\nconnections? Indeed has he shown how we can get by using only ordinary\nobjects and collections of them to serve as truth-makers? We need to\nbe clear about what Lewis is trying to do in this paper. He\nisn\u2019t reporting upon a damascene conversion, belatedly\nrecognising what he had previously denied, that the truth-making role\nis genuine, but then ingeniously coming up with the idea that\nqua-versions of things perform this role just as effectively\nas states of affairs, only without necessary connections between\ndistinct existences. Rather, Lewis\u2019 aim in this paper is to damn\nthe very idea of truth-makers with faint praise. By showing how\nqua versions of things performed the truth-making role just\nas effectively as facts or tropes Lewis aimed to show how\nexplanatorily bankrupt the truth-making role truly was (MacBride 2005:\n134\u20136, Bricker 2015: 180\u20133).\n\nThere are various criticisms of detail that might be made. MacBride\n(2005: 130\u20132) points out that Lewis failed to provide any\naccount of the truthmakers for relational predications and argues that\nit is very difficult to see how the lacuna can be filled when the\nclass of eligible truthmakers is restricted by Lewis to the class of\nordinary things and only intrinsic counterpart relations can be\nevoked. Lewis considers a relaxation of the latter requirement when it\ncame to negative existentials (qua unaccompanied by unicorns\ndoes not express an intrinsic counterpart relation). But MacBride\nargues removing the latter requirement risks trivialising\nLewis\u2019s account because for any object a such that\np is true, for any true p, a satisfies the\ndescription F: \u201cinhabiting a world where p is\ntrue\u201d, hence a qua F makes it true that p.\nBricker (2015: 179\u201380) argues that Lewis can provide for\nrelational predications by allowing sequences to be truthmakers, i.e.\nnot just ordinary things as Lewis required. But Bricker finds this\nsolution ultimately unattractive because it conflicts with another\ntruthmaking principle he finds plausible: that distinct atomic truths\nhave distinct truthmakers.\n\nOne might also object to Lewis\u2019 controversial modal metaphysical\nassumptions of counterpart theory more generally (Rodriguez-Pereyra\n2006b: 193; Dodd 2007: 385). More broadly, one might question whether\nLewis was right to place so much weight upon Hume\u2019s denial of\nnecessary connections between distinct existences or question whether\nLewis had interpreted it correctly (Daly 2000: 97\u20138; MacBride\n2005: 123\u20137; Hoffman 2006; Cameron 2008b). It\u2019s one thing\nto say that we shouldn\u2019t multiply necessities without necessity\nbut it\u2019s another thing to demand that we purge our world-view of\nthem altogether. What about dispositions, chances, laws etc?\nHume relied upon an empiricist theory of content to underpin his\nrejection of necessary connections. But Lewis certainly didn\u2019t\nadvocate such a view. One is left wondering therefore whether\nHume\u2019s denial of necessary connexions should be abandoned along\nwith the theory of content that inspired it, an antiquated relic. If\nso, then we have yet to be given a reason to retreat from either\noptimalism or (Truth Supervenes Upon Being) to (Subject\nMatter)(MacBride 2005: 126\u20137).\n3. What Motivates the Doctrine of Truth-makers?\n3.1 To catch a cheater\n\nWhat is the motivation for adopting a theory of truth-makers, whether\nmaximalist or optimalist? Following Sider, it has become customary to\ndescribe the \u201cwhole point\u201d of adopting a theory of\ntruth-makers thus: to \u201cCatch the cheaters\u201d who don\u2019t\nbelieve in truth-makers (Sider 2001: 40\u20131; see also Merricks\n2007: 2\u20133). But this is a bit like saying that the point of a\nbenefit system is to catch out benefit frauds. It\u2019s only if\nthere is some antecedent point in favour of truth-makers that there\ncan be anything wrong with leaving them out. Nonetheless, it is\npossible that we can come to appreciate the need for truth-makers by\nappreciating what is lacking in theories that neglect them. This is\nhow C.B. Martin and Armstrong came to recognise the necessity for\nadmitting truth-makers (Armstrong 1989b: 8\u201311, 2004: 1\u20133).\nConsider phenomenalism: the view that the physical world is a\nconstruction out of sense-impressions. One obstacle for this view is\nthe need to make sense in sense-impression terms of true claims we\nmake about the unobserved world. Martin noticed that the phenomenalist\ncould only appeal to brute, ungrounded counterfactuals about possible\nexperience to do so. But counterfactuals do not float free in a void.\nThey must be responsive to an underlying reality, the reality that\nmakes them true. For Martin this was the phenomenalists\u2019 fatal\nerror: their inability to supply credible truth-makers for truths\nabout unobserved objects. The same error afflicted Ryle\u2019s\nbehaviourism with its brute counterfactuals about non-existent\nbehaviour and Prior\u2019s presentism according to which there is\nnothing outside the present and so there is nothing for past-tensed\nand future-tensed truths to be held responsible to. We come to\nappreciate the need for truth-makers as the common need these\ndifferent theories fail to fulfil.\n\nAs Lewis points out, this demand for truth-makers represented an\noverreaction to what was undoubtedly a flaw in phenomenalism (1992:\n217). We can already understand what\u2019s wrong with phenomenalism\nwhen we appreciate that it fails to provide an account of the things\nupon which the truth of counterfactuals about sense impressions\nsupervene, i.e., when we see that it fails to satisfy (Subject\nMatter). This leaves under-motivated the claim that phenomenalism\nshould also be faulted for failing to supply truth-makers to ground\ncounterfactuals about sense-impressions. The same reasoning applies to\nbehaviourism and presentism; they also fail to satisfy (Subject\nMatter). So there\u2019s no need to adopt truth makers to catch\ncheats. All we need to do is to recognise the strictures (Subject\nMatter) places upon us.\n\nIt\u2019s a further flaw of Martin and Armstrong\u2019s reasoning\nthat even if we accede to the demand for truth-makers it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that even idealism is ruled out. According to Armstrong if we\nforsake the demand for truth-makers we thereby challenge \u201cthe\nrealistic insight that there is a world that exists independently of\nour thoughts and statements, making the latter true or false\u201d\n(1997: 128). But even an idealist could accept that there are\ntruth-makers whilst thinking of them as mind-dependent entities. So\nacceding to the demand for truth-makers doesn\u2019t tell us\nwhat\u2019s wrong with idealism (Daly 2005: 95\u20137). Bergmann,\nthe grandfather of the contemporary truth-maker movement, was explicit\nabout this: \u201cthe truth of S must be grounded\nontologically. On this first move idealists and realists agree\u201d\n(Bergmann 1961: 229). The realist-idealist distinction cuts across the\ndistinction between philosophers who admit truth-makers and those that\ndon\u2019t (Dodd 2002: 83\u20134).\n\nThe demand for truth-makers doesn\u2019t help \u201ccatch\ncheaters\u201d at all. Just acknowledge, e.g., some brute\ncounterfactual facts about sense data, or brute dispositions to behave\nin one way or another, or brute facts about what happened in the past\nor will happen in the future. What\u2019s unsatisfactory about these\nposits isn\u2019t that if they existed they\u2019d fail to make true\nstatements about unobserved objects or statements about mental states\nthat failed to manifest themselves in actual behaviour or statements\nabout the past or future. The problem is that we have difficulty in\nunderstanding how such facts or dispositions could be explanatorily\nsound (Horwich 2009: 195\u20137). Whatever we find lacking in\ntheories that posit such items, it isn\u2019t that they fail to\nprovide truth-makers, because they do. Of course if we are already\ncommitted to the need for truth makers then we will likely conceive of\nthe demand for them as, e.g., drawing the phenomenalist out into the\nopen to reveal the unfitness of their explanatory posits. But unless\nwe already have independent reasons for recognising the demand for\ntruth makers, catching cheaters cannot provide a motivation for\npositing them.\n3.2 Truth Depends on Being\n\nDoes this mean that we should join Bigelow in his retreat to\n(Truth Supervenes Upon Being) or step back with Lewis to\n(Subject Matter)? The problem is that these supervenience\nprinciples don\u2019t seem a satisfactory resting place either, not\nif our concern is to understand how true representations can touch\nupon an independent reality, i.e., something non-representational.\nFirst, it is familiar point that just appealing to a systematic\npattern of modal co-variation between truths and their subject\nmatters\u2014so that there is no difference in the former without a\ndifference in the latter\u2014doesn\u2019t provide us within any\ninsight into the underlying mechanism or mechanisms that sustains this\ndependency (Molnar 2000: 82\u20133; Heil 2003: 67; Daly 2005:\n97\u20138; Melia 2005: 82\u20133). Second, if possible worlds are\nconceived as maximal representations then these supervenience\nprinciples (understood in the idiom of possible worlds) fail to\narticulate what it is for a representation to touch upon being,\nsomething non-representational: \u201cFor the idea that every truth\ndepends on being is not the idea that every truth is\nentailed by propositions of a certain sort\u201d (Merricks\n2007: 86).\n\nA third reason for being unsatisfied with Lewis\u2019 (Subject\nMatter) is based upon the observation that the supervenience\ninvolved is symmetric. Just as there is no difference in the\ndistribution of truth-values amongst the body of propositions without\na reciprocating difference in their subject matter, there is no\ndifference in their subject matter without a difference in the\ndistribution of their truth-values (Armstrong 2004: 7\u20138). But we\nalso have the firm intuition that the truth or falsity of a\nproposition depends upon the state of the world in a way in which the\nstate of the world doesn\u2019t depend upon the proposition\u2019s\ntruth or falsity. This means that a supervenience principle like\n(Subject Matter) cannot be used to articulate the asymmetric\nway in which truth so depends upon being; for this, it is argued, we\nneed to rely upon a robust asymmetric notion of truth-making\n(Rodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 18\u201319). Bricker (2015: 180\u2013183)\nreplies on Lewis\u2019s behalf that the oft-heard complaint that\nsupervenience by itself is not a dependence or ontological priority\nrelation is besides the point. Rather, Bricker argues, the\nmetaphysical punch of Lewis\u2019s doctrine that truth supervenes\nupon being \u201chas little to do with the \u2018supervenience\npart\u2019 and everything to do with the \u2018being\u2019 part and\nthe conception of fundamentality that informs it\u201d, where by\n\u2018fundamental\u2019 Bricker means Lewis\u2019s theory of\nnatural properties and relations.\n\nBut is there really anything so problematic or mysterious about the\nasymmetric dependence of truth upon being that we need anything as\nheavy duty as truth-making or supervenience+naturalness to explain it?\nA number of proposals have been made for explaining the felt asymmetry\nin other terms. Horwich (1998: 105; 2008: 265\u201366) argues that\nasymmetric dependence of truth upon being arises from the fact that we\ncan deduce p from the proposition that p is true. But we\ncan equally deduce p from p is true so this fails to\nestablish an asymmetric dependence (K\u00fcnne 2003: 151\u201352;\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2005: 27). \n\nHornsby argues instead that there is explanatory asymmetry between its\nbeing the case that p and the proposition that p is\ntrue, because the latter requires more to be the case than the\nformer, (e.g.) that there are propositions (Hornsby 2005: 44). Dodd\nsuggests a cognate alternative: that the felt asymmetry of truth upon\nbeing arises from the fact that the identity of the proposition that p\nis partially determined by the worldly items it\u2019s about, so we\ncan\u2019t understand what is required for the proposition that p\nto be true without already having an understanding of what it is for\np to be the case (Dodd 2007: 398\u2013400).\n\nMacBride (2014) offers a purely semantic account of the felt asymmetry\nin terms of the interlocking mechanism of reference and satisfaction\nthat explains the truth of a proposition. Whilst we can deduce from\nthe truth of the proposition that p that p is the case,\nMacBride argues that we can\u2019t (ultimately) explain its being the\ncase that p in terms of the truth of the proposition that\np because its being the case that p is already assumed\nby the truth of that proposition, that is, has already performed a\nrole in the semantic mechanism whereby the truth-value is determined.\nBy contrast, MacBride continues, its being the case that p\nisn\u2019t determined by a semantic mechanism but by whatever worldly\nfactors, if any, that gave rise to p\u2019s being the case. Saenz\n(2018) replies that whilst reference and satisfaction may be used to\nexplain that propositions are true, they still \u201cdo not, in any\nsense, account for the world \u2018making it\u2019 [sic] that\npropositions are some way\u201d (a similar point is made by Mulligan\net al 1984: 288, see sec. 3.5 below for further discussion). But Saenz\nrisks begging the question by making the additional demand on the\ncharacter of the felt asymmetry of truth and being that it consists in\nmore than an asymmetric relationship between truth and being. Saenz\nholds that the felt asymmetry consists in the requirement that the\nworld makes propositions true but whether we need to appeal to the\nidea of the world making propositions true in the first place is the\npoint at issue. Finally, Liggins (2012) argues that the felt asymmetry\nbetween truth and being is best explained in terms of the asymmetry of\ngrounding, although, as we have seen, the asymmetry of grounding is\ncontested (see sec. 1.6 above for further discussion). \n3.3 Correspondence\n\n\u201cCatching cheats\u201d doesn\u2019t supply a motivation for\nadopting truth-makers. Are there other motivations for so doing? One\nsuch motivation is that truth-making falls out naturally from the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. \n\n\nAnybody who is attracted to the correspondence theory of truth should\nbe drawn to the truth-maker [sic]. Correspondence demands a\ncorrespondent, and a correspondent for a truth is a truth-maker.\n(Armstrong 1997: 14; see also 1997: 128\u20139, 2004: 16\u20137)\n\n\n\nAccording to Armstrong, the \u201ctruth-maker principle\u201d (aka\nmaximalism) just is what we are left with once we drop the assumption\nfrom the correspondence theory that the relation between truth bearers\nand truth-makers is one-one. Of course, the truth-making relation,\nhowever it is explicated, cannot be the relation of correspondence in\nterms of which truth is defined\u2014for whereas the latter\nis symmetric, the former isn\u2019t (Beebee & Dodd 2005b:\n13\u20134). But this doesn\u2019t prevent truth being defined using\nthe truth-making relation, albeit in a more roundabout way\naccording to the following pattern,\n\n(C)\n S is true \u21d4 (\u2203x)(S\nis-made-true-by x).\n\n\nOf course such a definition will only succeed if the relation\nexpressed by \u201cis-made-true-by\u201d can itself be explicated\nwithout relying upon the notion of truth itself or other\nnotions that implicitly presuppose it, e.g., entailment (Merricks\n2007: 15). This is no doubt one of the reasons that principles of\ntruth-making are typically not put forward as definitions of truth\n(David 2009: 144). Another objection made by Horwich is that it is\nimplausible to suppose that an ordinary person understands the notion\nof truth via the heterogeneous principles that govern the\nprovision of truth-makers for different types of propositions.\nIt\u2019s more plausible to suppose that we first grasp what truth\nis, and only subsequently figure out what truth-makers are required\nfor the various kinds of propositions there are (Horwich 2009:\n188).\n3.4 Deflationism\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that so far from presupposing the\nnotion of truth, the various truth-making principles we have\ndiscussed operate at a far more subterranean level. Bigelow writes,\n\u201cThe force behind Truth-maker lies deeper than worries about the\nnature of truth and of truth-bearers\u201d (Bigelow 1988: 127, 2009:\n396\u20137; Robinson 2000: 152; Lewis 2001: 605\u20136; Horwich\n2009: 188\u20139, Bricker 2015: 169). Suppose we understand what it\nis to be truth-maker in terms of entailment. Then whatever the range\nof truths we think are capable of being rendered true, the\n\u201cguts\u201d of our truth-maker principle can be stated using\nthe schema,\n\n(Schema) \nIf P, then there must be something in the world whose\nexistence entails that P.\n\n\nThis schema is equivalent to the infinitely many conditionals that\nfall under it:\n\n(i1)\n If the donkey is brown, then there must be something in the world\nwhose existence entails that the donkey is brown;\n(i2)\n if the Parthenon is on the Acropolis then there must be something\nin the world whose existence entails that the Parthenon is on the\nAcropolis; and so on.\n\n\nNote that neither \u201ctrue\u201d nor \u201ctruth\u201d shows up\nanywhere in the schema or its instances. Arguably the only role that\nthe notion of truth performs is the one that\nminimalist or deflationary theories of truth emphasize, that of\nenabling us to capture all of that unending string of conditionals in\na single slogan,\n\n(Slogan) \nFor any truth, there must be something in the world whose\nexistence entails that truth.\n\n\nBut since truth is serving here only as a device of\ngeneralization, the real subject matter of (Slogan) is\nalready expressed by the conditionals (i1), (i2)\netc. Since they make no explicit mention of either\npropositions or truth, a theory of truth-makers is neither a theory\nabout propositions nor a theory about truth. If so, then the theory of\ntruth-makers can neither gain inspiration from, nor be tarred by the\nsame brush as the correspondence theory of truth. Nor need the theory\nof truth-makers be bedeviled by concerns about the nature of truth\nbearers.\n\nOne may nevertheless wonder whether Bigelow and Lewis have thrown the\nbaby out with the bathwater. MacBride (2013a) argues that if we do not\nallow ourselves the general thought that truth-bearers are true or\nfalse depending upon how things stand in the world then it is unclear\nwhat, if any, credibility (i1), (i2) etc. have. For\nwhy should there be something in the world whose existence\nnecessitates that (e.g.) cats purr? Why can\u2019t cats purr, even though\nthere is nothing whose existence entails that truth? Since\nSlogan is intended to be just shorthand for its instances,\n(i 1), (i 2) etc. it follows Slogan can\u2019t\nbe any more credible or motivated than its instances. If, however, we\nallow ourselves a conception of truth which isn\u2019t deflationary, i.e.\na substantial conception whereby truth is conceived as a relation\nborne by a truth-bearer to something worldly that exists independently\nof us, then, MacBride argues, we will have an independent reason for\npositing something worldly the existence of which necessitates the\ntruth that cats purr etc. (see also Armstrong 1997: 128). For further\ndiscussion of deflationism in connection with truth-making see McGrath\n2003, Vision 2005 and Thomas 2011. \n3.5 Truth-making and Conceptual Explanation\n\nOther philosophers appeal to the idea that when we say that a\nstatement is true because a truth-maker for it exists, the\n\u201cbecause\u201d we employ is a connective (K\u00fcnne 2003:\n150\u20136; Hornsby 2005: 35\u20137; Melia 2005: 78\u20139;\nSchnieder 2006a: 29\u201337; Mulligan 2007). They think of this\nconnective on the model of logical operators (\u201c&\u201d,\n\u201c\u223c\u201d etc.) i.e., expressions that link sentences but\nwithout expressing a relation that holds between the states of\naffairs, facts or tropes that these sentences denote; but unlike\n\u201c&\u201d, \u201c\u223c\u201d etc., \u201cbecause\u201d\nis not truth-functional. According to these philosophers, the\ntruth-maker panegyrists have misconstrued the logical form of\n\u201cmakes true\u201d. They have taken it to be a verb like\n\u201cx hits y\u201d when really it is akin to the\nconnective \u201c\u2192\u201d or \u201cbecause\u201d (Melia 2005:\n78). There\u2019s no need to introduce truth-makers as the special\nthings that stand at one end of the truth-making relation\nwith true statements at the other, no need to because it\u2019s only\nsuperficial features of the grammar of our language that suggest there\nis a truth-making relation to stand at the ends of.\n\nTypically philosophers who maintain that \u201cmakes true\u201d is a\nconnective do not argue for this conclusion directly but encourage us\nto dwell upon the fact that it natural to hear the\n\u201cbecause\u201d that occurs in equivalent constructions as a\nconnective. When we hear, e.g., \u201cIt is true that the rose is red\nbecause the rose is red\u201d we don\u2019t naturally hear it as\nexpressing a binary relation between two things. So we shouldn\u2019t\nhear, or at least don\u2019t have to hear, \u201cIt\u2019s true\nthat the rose is red in virtue of the rose\u2019s being red\u201d or\n\u201cthe rose\u2019s being red makes it true that the rose is\nred\u201d as a expressing a binary relation between a truth and\ntruth-maker either.\n\nK\u00fcnne has gone further and suggested that the truth-making\nconnective is really the \u201cbecause\u201d of conceptual\nexplanation (2003: 154\u20135; see also Schnieder 2006a: 36\u20137).\nHe encourages us to hear the equivalence between,\n\n(R)\n He is a child of a sibling of one of your parents, which makes\nhim your first cousin\n\n\nand,\n\n(R*)\n He is your first cousin because he is a child of a sibling of one\nof your parents.\n\n\nHe tells us that the \u201cbecause\u201d in (R*) is the\n\u201cbecause\u201d of \u201cconceptual explanation\u201d. Since\n(R) and (R*) are equivalent, he concludes that the\n\u201cmakes\u201d construction in (R) is just a cumbersome\nway of expressing the \u201cbecause\u201d of conceptual explanation\nin (R*). K\u00fcnne then invites us take the use of\n\u201cmakes\u201d in (R) as a model for understanding the\ntruth-making construction,\n\n(S)\n The fact that snow is white makes the statement that snow is\nwhite true.\n\n\nThis enables us to see that (S) does \u201cnot affirm a\nrelation of any kind between a truth vehicle and something in the\nworld\u201d (K\u00fcnne 2003: 155). Why? Because it is equivalent\nto,\n\n(S*)\n The statement that snow is white is true because snow is\nwhite.\n\n\na claim that makes no (explicit) mention of facts. Moreover, the\nsecond clause of (S*), like the second clause of\n(R*), tells us when it is correct to affirm its first clause.\nIn both cases we have an explanation that draws respectively upon our\nunderstanding of the concepts cousin and truth.\nDrawing upon these materials, we are then able to construct an\nexplanation of the felt asymmetry whereby the truth of what we say\nabout the world depends upon what the world is like, but not the other\nway around. What is written on the left-hand-side of (S*) is\nconceptually more sophisticated than what is written upon the\nright-hand-side because the former requires us to be able to grasp the\nconcepts of statement and truth to understand it\nwhereas the latter does not. Accordingly the latter requires less of\nboth the world and us than the former to be both understood and true.\nThat\u2019s why it makes sense to deploy the right-hand-side (a claim\nabout reality) to explain the left-hand-side (a claim about a truth\nbearer) but not the other way around (Hornsby 2005: 44; Dodd 2007:\n399\u2013400). It may still be that this is just wishful thinking,\nuntil it has been established that the \u201cbecause\u201d of truth\nmaking is a connective rather than a relational expression\u2014i.e.,\nnot just because it would be technically convenient for us to believe\nit to be so or because it sounds like a connective to someone with the\nears of a naive grammarian. As we saw in section 1.6, some advocates\nof truth-making as grounding also consider \u201cbecause\u201d to be\na connective, although there is much disagreement about its\nimplications. Some early exponents of the connective view of\ntruth-making have embraced grounding (e.g. Schnieder), while others\nhave not (e.g. Hornsby and Dodd). \n3.6 Truth Making and Quantification\n\nA final supporting suggestion: that the grand truth-maker projects of\nthe late twentieth century arose (partly) out of a failure to\nappreciate the logical variety of natural language quantifiers that we\nunreflectively employ when expressing the intuitions that speak in\nfavour of truth- makers.\n\nConsider how Armstrong expressed himself when he started out: \n\n\nIt seems obvious that for every true contingent proposition there must\nbe something in the world (in the largest sense of\n\u201csomething\u201d) which makes the proposition true. For\nconsider any true contingent proposition and imagine that it is false.\nWe must automatically imagine some difference in the world. (Armstrong\n1973: 11) \n\n\nBigelow asks us to compare two worlds, one in which A is\ntrue, the other in which it is false. According to Bigelow, \n\n\nThere must surely be some difference between these two possible\nworlds! They are clearly different in that A is true in one\nbut not the other. So there must be something in one of these worlds\nwhich is lacking in the other and which accounts for the difference in\ntruth. (1988: 126) \n\n\nArmstrong and Bigelow make the same assumption about the\n\u201csome\u201d they employ in their expression of what makes the\ndifference between the world in which A is true and the world\nin which A is false; they assume it is an objectual\nquantifier in name position.\n\nWith this assumption in place it is an easy move to make to think that\nthere must be some thing that we quantify over that\nconstitutes the difference between these circumstances,\nviz. the truth-maker for A. But as Williamson\nremarks \u201cWe should not assume that all quantification is either\nobjectual or substitutional\u201d (1999: 262\u20133; cf.\nPrior 1971: 31\u20134). Williamson argues that that the truth maker\nprinciple in fact \n\n\ninvolves irreducible non-substitutional quantification into sentence\nposition\u2026 We should not even assume that all non-substitutional\nquantification is interpreted in terms of assignments of values to the\nvariables. For \u201cvalue\u201d is a noun, not a sentence. (1999:\n263)\n\n\nBut suppose the \u201csome\u201d Armstrong and Bigelow employ is\nunderstood not as an objectual quantifier that comes equipped with a\ndomain of entities over which it ranges but is understood in some\nother way. Then it would be open to us to acknowledge the force of\nArmstrong and Bigelow\u2019s intuition that the circumstances in\nwhich A is true are somehow different from those in which it\nisn\u2019t, but without our having to think that there exists\nsomething that we\u2019ve quantified over than makes it so. Evidently\nit will not be until we have arrived at a settled view of the\nadmissible interpretations our quantifiers may bear that this issue\ncan be settled in a principled rather than dogmatic manner.\n",
