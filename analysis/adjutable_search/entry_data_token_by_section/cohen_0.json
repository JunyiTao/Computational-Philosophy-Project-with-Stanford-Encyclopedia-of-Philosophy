    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nBorn in 1842 in Coswig, Germany, Cohen was raised in a devout family.\nHis father was a synagogue cantor, and Cohen left Gymnasium\nin order to attend a rabbinical seminary in Breslau, Silesia (now\nWroc\u0142aw, Poland). But he decided against becoming a rabbi, and\nenrolled in university first in Breslau and then in Berlin, where he\nattended classes taught by a leading light in the history of\nphilosophy, the Aristotelian scholar and metaphysician Adolf\nTrendelenburg. He received his doctorate from the University of Halle,\nafter which, encouraged by Heymann Steinthal, he\nstudied V\u00f6lkerpsychologie, a philological and\nanthropological investigation of the origins of cultural products such\nas art and literature. It was in a journal of\nV\u00f6lkerpsychologie and linguistics that he published his\nfirst major work of Kant interpretation, an intervention in\nTrendelenburg\u2019s and Kuno Fischer\u2019s debate about\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic (see \u00a72 below). That essay\nalso marked a decisive turn in Cohen\u2019s philosophical\norientation, and after two years in which he wrote on both\nKant\u2019s pre-critical philosophy and the Critique of Pure\nReason, he was appointed lecturer at the University of Marburg.\nThree years later, he was promoted to full Professor, a rank that was\nat that time in Germany almost never granted to unconverted Jews in\nphilosophy departments. It was no coincidence that Cohen\u2019s\nappointment and subsequent promotion took place during Bismark\u2019s\nanti-Catholic Kulturkampf, a brief period of relatively\nliberal attitudes toward Jews. But following Heinrich von\nTreitschke\u2019s notorious 1879 anti-Semitic attack on German-Jewish\nwriters and intellectuals, Cohen was compelled to enter the public\ndebate about the Jews\u2019 place in Imperial Germany. His\n\u201cDeclaration on the Jewish Question\u201d appeared in 1880, and\nquestions of German-Jewish identity would occupy him throughout his\ncareer (Schwarzschild 1979; Wiedebach 1997, Pts. 4\u20135; and Beiser\n2018). He remained at Marburg for almost four decades. After retiring\nfrom Marburg in 1912, Cohen returned to Berlin in order to teach at a\nrabbinical seminary, the Academy of Jewish Sciences. He spent four\nyears there, writing principally about religious problems, until his\ndeath in 1918.\n\nCohen\u2019s period of philosophical productivity spanned the\nduration of the German empire, from the late 1860s until 1918. We can\ndistinguish three periods in his writing (van der Linden 1988,\n205\u20136; Bonaunet 2004: 22ff). The first, early period is\ncharacterized by Cohen\u2019s attempts to develop his own views as\ncommentaries on Kant. During this period, he wrote Kant\u2019s\nTheory of Experience, Kant\u2019s Foundations of\nEthics, and Kant\u2019s Foundations of Aesthetics. The\nsecond period marks Cohen\u2019s mature philosophical work, which\ntook the form of his multi-volume System of Philosophy. In\nthe System, Cohen explicitly abandoned central Kantian\ndoctrines, and presented his views systematically, and as his own,\nrather than offering them as interpretations of Kant. The\nSystem included The Logic of Pure Knowledge, The\nEthics of Pure Will, and The Aesthetics of Pure Feeling.\n(He planned, but never wrote, a fourth part of the System on\nthe psychology of \u201ccultural consciousness.\u201d This fourth\npart was to provide the systematic foundation for the other three\nparts of the System [see Adelmann 1968 and Moynahan 2018].)\nFinally, although Cohen had been interested in religious questions\nthroughout his career, in the last years of his life they were his\noverwhelming concern. It was during this period that he wrote his\nReligion of Reason Out of the Sources of Judaism.\n\nHowever, while Cohen\u2019s interests and views evolved over the\ncourse of his career, his philosophy from all three periods\nnevertheless exhibits points of deep continuity. All of Cohen\u2019s\nmajor works share a profoundly historical orientation. A concern with\nthe history of philosophy dominates his writing, and he was convinced\nof history\u2019s continuing significance for philosophy in the\npresent. But he was also concerned with the histories of those\nsubjects he took to be philosophy\u2019s topics, including science,\nethics, and religion. This concern for history permeates his thought\nso completely that even in his systematic works, he prefers to\nintroduce concepts and theories not by defining them\nstraightforwardly, but by rehearsing major episodes in the history of\ntheir development. This historically-oriented method was a model for\nwhat later philosophers called Problemgeschichte \u2013 that\nis, the history of the origin, development, and evolution of\nphilosophical problems. In stands in contrast to historical surveys of\ncandidate solutions to problems the philosopher conceives as fixed,\nunchanging, and unresponsive to a broader philosophical context. (In\nCohen\u2019s hands, this historical orientation contributes in no\nsmall part to other aspects of his writing that none of his readers\ncan fail to notice: its obscurity, repetition, and sometimes\nunnecessary length.)\n\nTwo further commitments are continuous threads over the course of\nCohen\u2019s career and across multiple areas of his philosophical\nconcern: his idealism and (what Frederick Beiser [2018] calls) his\n\u201cmethodological rationalism.\u201d Cohen expresses his idealism\nin different ways over the course of his career. But we may\napproximate it as the view that a priori laws of human knowledge\ndetermine what counts an an object for us. For Cohen, this idealism is\nintended to capture Kant\u2019s insight that we can have a priori\nknowledge only of those features of objects that our own mind\ncontributes to them. But for Cohen, this is not an exclusively Kantian\ndoctrine. He develops it in part out of his early interpretation of\nPlato, according to which we strive to have things conform to our\nideas.\n\nCohen\u2019s methodological rationalism is his commitment to, as\nrecent commentators have put it, \u201cthe search for\nreasons\u201d (Beiser 2018, 3), the assumption of \u201cthe\nintelligibility of being\u201d (Renz 2018, 10), and the\n\u201cattempt to ground knowledge in critically reflexive,\nhypothetical, and self-consciously revisable concepts subject to\njustification\u201d (Nahme 2019, 8). Cohen\u2019s is not a\nrationalism that accepts any substantive doctrine, principle, or axiom\nas indubitable or necessarily true. Rather, it is the methodological\ncommitment never to accept any doctrine, principle, axiom, or any\nother representation as brute or unexplainable. Instead, for Cohen we\nmust always seek reasons for those representations. In Cohen\u2019s\nepistemology and philosophy of science, this commitment would\nculminate in his conception of \u201cpure thinking,\u201d that is,\nthinking that is free from the influence of anything external to it\n(see \u00a75 below). In his mature ethics and political philosophy, it\nis expressed in his view that ethics and the laws that unify a\ncommunity \u201cmust be seen as an appeal to justified\nreasoning...\u201d (Nahme 2019, 252) (see \u00a76 below). At the\nsame time Christian Damb\u00f6ck (2017, Ch. 4) argues that there is a\nsense in which Cohen is an \u201cempiricist,\u201d by which\nDamb\u00f6ck means that Cohen insists that philosophy must attend to\nthe facts of history and culture as it finds them. Ursula Renz (2018)\nargues that these two senses of \u201crationalism\u201d and\n\u201cempiricism\u201d need not conflict with one another. \n\nCohen himself came to think that one commitment above all else unified\nhis philosophy, from his earliest interpretation of Kant to his mature\nSystem of Philosophy. It was his commitment to a\nphilosophical method he claimed was Kant\u2019s, and that Cohen and\nhis students called the \u201ctranscendental method.\u201d What\nfollows is a sketch of that method in Cohen\u2019s philosophy: how it\nemerged from his interpretation of Kant; how he sought to apply that\nmethod in epistemology and philosophy of science, as well as in\nethics, political theory, and aesthetics; and finally, how he sought\nto articulate a view of religion as a necessary counterpart to\nphilosophy done according to that method.\n",
