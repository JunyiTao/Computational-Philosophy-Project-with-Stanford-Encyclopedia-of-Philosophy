    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n5. Natural Philosophy\n\nComing to natural philosophy, Gregory of Rimini\u2019s conception of\nthe continuum has been the object of several studies (i.e., Maier 1949,\n172\u2013173, 176\u2013177; Cross 1998; Sylla 2005,\n260\u2013268). According to Gregory, following Adam Wodeham, the\ncontinuum is not composed of point-like entities, but parts of the\ncontinuum are themselves magnitudes (Cross 1998, 96). Gregory also\nclaims, this time against Wodeham, that the division of the continuum\ncan actually be completed, so that it is composed of an actual\ninfinity of potential extended parts (Cross 1998, 97\u201398). It is\nunderstood that each of these parts itself includes an infinity of\nparts (Cross 1998, 102). That said, a problem is to see how exactly\nthe division of the continuum can be completed if any part of the\ncontinuum must be said to contain an infinity of parts. It has been\nargued that it is in connection with this issue that several scholars\n(following Maier 1949, 172\u2013173) read Gregory as holding that\nthere are infinitesimal parts in the continuum (Cross 1998,\n103\u2013104). Yet, in fact, the process is completed, not because\none reaches something that cannot be divided, but because every part\nhas been actually set apart from the others, including the ones it\ncontains (Cross 1998, 103). It is in connection with its conception of\na continuum composed of an actual infinity of parts, each themselves\ncomposed of an actual infinity of parts, that Gregory explains how an\ninfinite can be greater than another by including it (Cross 1998,\n105\u2013106; Thakkar 2009, 631\u2013632), thus answering\nBradwardine\u2019s objection on infinite parts and wholes (Thakkar\n2009, 628\u2013629).\n\nGregory\u2019s views on minima naturalia also attracted\nattention. Although Gregory acknowledges that there is a minimal\nextensive quantity some subject needs to have in order to receive a\ngiven form (Sylla 2011, 403), he rejects the idea that forms of a\ngiven species would have intensive minima, relying on ideas developed\nby Richard Kilvington (Knuuttila 1971, 313; Loewe 2014, 320\u2013323).\n\nIn general, Gregory\u2019s answer to the problem of the intension and\nremission of forms (i.e. how to account for increases or decreases of\na given quality) had a life of its own, since it circulated as a\nseparate treatise, the Tractatus de intensione et remissione\nformarum corporalium (Loewe 2014, 274). Gregory argued that when\nintension occurs, a form of the same species is added to the subject,\nso that this new form and the preceding form now constitute a total\nform that has per se unity (Loewe 2014, 286, 316).\n",
