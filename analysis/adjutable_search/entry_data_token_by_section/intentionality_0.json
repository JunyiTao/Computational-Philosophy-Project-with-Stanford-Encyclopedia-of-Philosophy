Why is intentionality so-called?\n\nContemporary discussions of the nature of intentionality are an\nintegral part of discussions of the nature of minds: what are minds\nand what is it to have a mind? They arise in the context of\nontological and metaphysical questions about the fundamental nature of\nmental states: states such as perceiving, remembering, believing,\ndesiring, hoping, knowing, intending, feeling, experiencing, and so\non. What is it to have such mental states? How does the mental relate\nto the physical, i.e., how are mental states related to an\nindividual\u2019s body, to states of his or her brain, to his or her\nbehavior and to states of affairs in the world?\n\nWhy is intentionality so-called? For reasons soon to be explained, in\nits philosophical usage, the meaning of the word\n\u2018intentionality\u2019 should not be confused with the ordinary\nmeaning of the word \u2018intention.\u2019 As indicated by the\nmeaning of the Latin word tendere, which is the etymology of\n\u2018intentionality,\u2019 the relevant idea behind intentionality\nis that of mental directedness towards (or attending to) objects, as\nif the mind were construed as a mental bow whose arrows could be\nproperly aimed at different targets. In medieval logic and philosophy,\nthe Latin word intentio was used for what contemporary\nphilosophers and logicians nowadays call a \u2018concept\u2019 or an\n\u2018intension\u2019: something that can be both true of non-mental\nthings and properties\u2014things and properties lying outside the\nmind\u2014and present to the mind. On the assumption that a concept\nis itself something mental, an intentio may also be true of\nmental things. For example, the concept of a dog, which is a\nfirst-level intentio, applies to individual dogs or to the\nproperty of being a dog. It also falls under various higher-level\nconcepts that apply to it, such as being a concept, being mental, etc.\nIf so, then while the first-level concept is true of non-mental\nthings, the higher-level concepts may be true of something mental.\nNotice that on this way of thinking, concepts that are true of mental\nthings are presumably logically more complex than concepts that are\ntrue of non-mental things.\n\nAlthough the meaning of the word \u2018intentionality\u2019 in\ncontemporary philosophy is related to the meanings of such words as\n\u2018intension\u2019 (or \u2018intensionality\u2019 with an\ns) and \u2018intention,\u2019 nonetheless it ought not to\nbe confused with either of them. On the one hand, in contemporary\nEnglish, \u2018intensional\u2019 and \u2018intensionality\u2019\nmean \u2018non-extensional\u2019 and\n\u2018non-extensionality,\u2019 where both extensionality and\nintensionality are logical features of words and sentences. For\nexample, \u2018creature with a heart\u2019 and \u2018creature with\na kidney\u2019 have the same extension because they are true of the\nsame individuals: all the creatures with a kidney are creatures with a\nheart. But the two expressions have different intensions because the\nword \u2018heart\u2019 does not have the same extension, let alone\nthe same meaning, as the word \u2018kidney.\u2019 On the other hand,\nintention and intending are specific states of mind that, unlike\nbeliefs, judgments, hopes, desires or fears, play a distinctive role\nin the etiology of actions. By contrast, intentionality is a pervasive\nfeature of many different mental states: beliefs, hopes, judgments,\nintentions, love and hatred all exhibit intentionality. In fact,\nBrentano held that intentionality is the hallmark of the mental: much\nof twentieth century philosophy of mind has been shaped by what, in\nthis entry, will be referred to as \u201cBrentano\u2019s third\nthesis.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, it is worthwhile to distinguish between levels of\nintentionality. Many of an individual\u2019s psychological states\nwith intentionality (e.g., beliefs) are about (or represent)\nnon-mental things, properties and states of affairs. Many are also\nabout another\u2019s psychological states (e.g., another\u2019s\nbeliefs). Beliefs about others\u2019 beliefs display what is known as\n\u2018higher-order intentionality.\u2019 Since the seminal (1978)\npaper by primatologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff entitled\n\u201cDoes the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?\u201d, under the\nheading \u2018theory of mind,\u2019 much empirical research of the\npast thirty years has been devoted to the psychological questions\nwhether non-human primates can ascribe psychological states with\nintentionality to others and how human children develop their capacity\nto ascribe to others psychological states with intentionality (cf. the\ncomments by philosophers Jonathan Bennett, Daniel Dennett and Gilbert\nHarman to Premack and Woodruff\u2019s paper and the SEP entry\n folk psychology: as a theory).\n\nThe concept of intentionality has played a central role both in the\ntradition of analytic philosophy and in the phenomenological\ntradition. As we shall see, some philosophers go so far as claiming\nthat intentionality is characteristic of all mental states.\nBrentano\u2019s characterization of intentionality is quite complex.\nAt the heart of it is Brentano\u2019s notion of the\n\u2018intentional inexistence of an object,\u2019 which is analyzed\nin the next section.\n",
