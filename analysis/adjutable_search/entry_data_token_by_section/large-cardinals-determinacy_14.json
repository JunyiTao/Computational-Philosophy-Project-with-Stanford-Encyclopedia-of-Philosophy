    "main_text": "The Case for Definable Determinacy || Basic Notions\n4.1  Basic Notions\n\nLet us stress from the beginning that because of the incompleteness\ntheorems the case for any new axiom is going to have to be\ndelicate. The standard way of establishing a proposition in\nmathematics is by proving it within some accepted set of\naxioms. However, the axioms implicitly accepted by mathematicians in\neveryday practice seem to be exhausted by those of ZFC, and we are\nhere dealing with questions and new axioms that are beyond the reach\nof ZFC. Given the nature of the case, it seems unlikely therefore that\none will have a knock-down argument for new axioms. Instead it seems\nthat the most that one can hope for is to accumulate evidence until\neventually the case becomes compelling. The other alternative is that\nthe case remains divided between two equally compelling but mutually\ninconsistent approaches. \n\n Let us first say something very general about how such a case\nmight proceed. Some propositions have a certain degree\nof intrinsic plausibility. For example, the statement that\nthere is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using pieces that\nare \u03a3\u033012\nis intrinsically plausible, although it is not provable in ZFC. Such\ninitial support for a proposition is not definitive. For example, the\nstatement that there are no space filling curves and the statement\nthat there is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using any\npieces whatsoever might have once seemed intrinsically plausible. But\nin each case these statements were overturned by theorems proved\nagainst the backdrop of systems that had much more than this degree of\ninitial plausibility in their favour. However, although such intrinsic\nplausibility is not definitive, it nevertheless has some weight. \n\n Moreover, the weight can accumulate. Suppose we have two\nstatements from conceptually distinct domains that are intrinsically\nplausible\u2014for example, one might concern the existence of (inner\nmodels of) large cardinal axioms and the other might concern the\nregularity properties of simply definable sets. If it is shown that\nthe first implies the second then the second inherits the initial\nplausibility attached to the first. Should the two statements\nultimately be shown to imply one another this would strengthen the\ncase for each. The hope is that through the accumulation of\nmathematical results\u2014theorems proved in first-order logic, which\nare matters upon which everyone can agree\u2014various independent\nintrinsically plausible statements will come to reinforce each other\nto the point where the case as a whole becomes compelling. \n\n Some have maintained that this is actually the situation with\naxioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms. In the\nremainder of this section we shall present the case in the strongest\nway we know how. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on the notion of intrinsic\nplausibility and how it figures in the structure of reason, see\nChapter 9 of Parsons (2008). \n",
