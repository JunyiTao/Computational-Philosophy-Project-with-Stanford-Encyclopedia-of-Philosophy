He was shocked to be accused of being\naggressive and nasty, so he replied by accusing his accusers of the\nvery same thing. He felt it necessary to respond to most of the\nbook\u2019s major reviews in print, and later assembled these replies\ninto a section of his next book, Science in a Free Society,\nentitled \u201cConversations with Illiterates\u201d. Here he berated\nthe unfortunate reviewers for having misread Against Method,\nas well as for being constitutionally incapable of distinguishing\nbetween irony, playfulness, argument by reductio ad absurdum, and the\n(apparently rather few) things he had really committed himself to in\nAM. The spectacle of Feyerabend levelling these accusations\nat others is not itself without irony. (His widow reports that in his\nlater years, SFS was the book he would most like to have\ndistanced himself from). In the commotion surrounding AM,\nFeyerabend succumbed to depression: \n\n\u2026 now I was alone, sick with some unknown affliction; my\nprivate life was in a mess, and I was without a defense. I often\nwished I had never written that fucking book. (KT, p. 147).\n\n\nFeyerabend saw himself as having undermined the arguments for\nscience\u2019s privileged position within culture, and much of his\nlater work was a critique of the position of science within Western\nsocieties. Because there is no scientific method, we can\u2019t\njustify science as the best way of acquiring knowledge. And the\nresults of science don\u2019t prove its excellence, since\nthese results have often depended on the presence of non-scientific\nelements, science prevails only because \u201cthe show has been\nrigged in its favour\u201d (SFS, p. 102), and other\ntraditions, despite their achievements, have never been given a\nchance. The truth, he suggests, is that \n\nscience is much closer to myth than a scientific philosophy is\nprepared to admit. It is one of the many forms of thought that have\nbeen developed by man, and not necessarily the best. It is\nconspicuous, noisy, and impudent, but it is inherently superior only\nfor those who have already decided in favour of a certain ideology, or\nwho have accepted it without ever having examined its advantages and\nits limits (AM, p. 295).\n\n\nThe separation of church and state should therefore be supplemented by\nthe separation of science and state, in order for us to achieve the\nhumanity we are capable of. Setting up the ideal of a free society as\n\u201ca society in which all traditions have equal rights and equal\naccess to the centres of power\u201d (SFS, p. 9), Feyerabend\nargues that science is a threat to democracy. To defend society\nagainst science we should place science under democratic control and\nbe intensely sceptical about scientific \u201cexperts\u201d,\nconsulting them only if they are controlled democratically by juries\nof laypeople.\n",
