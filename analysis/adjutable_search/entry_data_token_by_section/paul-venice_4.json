    "main_text": "Semantics: The Meaning and Truth of Propositions\n3. Semantics: The Meaning and Truth of Propositions\n\nPaul of Venice deals with the problem of the meaning and truth of\nsentences in his Logica Magna and in his commentaries on the\nMetaphysics and on the Categories. His theory is\nsubstantially the same in all these works, but in the two commentaries\nhe stresses the ontological implications of his semantic choices\nslightly more, and modifies his solution of the question of the\nmeaning of a true negative sentence. Paul\u2019s purpose is twofold.\nHe intends (1) to determine the ontological status and nature of the\ncomplexe significabile more precisely; and (2) to develop a\ngeneral theory of the proposition which would be logically more\nrigorous and less compromised by a metaphysics of the possible than\nthat supported by Gregory of Rimini, his main source on that subject.\nFor this reason Paul deals with the question of the truth and falsity\nof a proposition before examining the problem of its meaning, and\nsolves the latter on the basis of the answer to the former, thus\ninverting the order followed by Gregory.\n\nAs a sign of special respect, Gregory of Rimini is the only author\ncited by name in the two treatises of Paul\u2019s Logica\nMagna devoted to the questions of the meaning and truth of a\nsentence. Paul\u2019s critique is nevertheless all-embracing. He\nlists thirteen arguments against Gregory\u2019s theses: six are\nphilosophical and seven theological (LM, II, tr. 11, pp.\n96\u2013104). We can focus on the most important ones, as they help\nus to better understand Paul\u2019s final choices on the matter.\n\nThe main philosophical arguments concern Gregory\u2019s theory of the\nlevels of being. As is well known, the aim of Gregory\u2019s theory\nof complexe significabile seems to be to identify and\ndescribe an objective and independent molecular entity existing in\nre, which can be the significatum or the referent of a\nsentence, and therefore guarantees the success of our effort to\nunderstand the world. According to Gregory, this entity is the\ncomplexe significabile, that is something (1) complex but one\nin number, which cannot be identified with the things that the subject\nand/or the predicate of the sentence signify; (2) real but distinct\nfrom the extramental categorial items as well as from their\ncorresponding mental signs; and (3) the proper and adequate object of\na possible act of signification (see the prologue of his commentary on\nthe first book of Sentences, q. 1, a. 1, pp. 3\u20134). It\nis precisely in order to provide the complexe significabile\nwith a suitable ontological status, and every sentence with a\nsignificatum that Gregory elaborates a theory of the levels of being.\nAccording to it, the world is constituted by (1) the categorial items\n(or atomic objects) which are the ground of existence of every other\nbeing; (2) the states of affairs connected to them; and (3) the\npossible states of affairs that the atomic objects could cause if they\nwere combined in a different way from the actual one. In fact, Gregory\nclaims that the terms \u2018something\u2019\n(\u2018aliquid\u2019), \u2018thing\u2019\n(\u2018res\u2019), and \u2018being\u2019\n(\u2018ens\u2019) are synonyms, and that they have a\nthreefold meaning. They can be taken (1) for anything signifiable in\nany way (that is, by a simple or a complex expression, truly or\nfalsely)\u2014this would be the sense in which Aristotle in the\nchapter de priori of his Categories says that it is\nnecessary that an expression is called true or false when a thing is\nor is not. (2) For anything signifiable by a simple or a complex\nexpression, but truly. And (3) for an existing essence or entity\n(ibidem, pp. 8\u20139). This distinction implies that (1)\nthe complexe significabilia are not real in the same sense as\nthe entia praedicamentalia are; (2) the complexe\nsignificabilia designated by false sentences have a feebler\nreality than those designated by true sentences, but they are\nnevertheless real and constitutive elements of the world; and (3) the\nreality of complexe significabilia (both true and false) is\ndifferent from that of the categorial items on which this reality is\ngrounded.\n\nPaul denies (1) that states of affairs, both actual and possible, are\nconstitutive parts of the world really distinct from the categorial\nitems, and (2) that whatever is signifiable by a complex expression is\na thing. In fact, according to Paul, the term \u2018something\u2019,\ntaken in the first or second sense enumerated by Gregory, is a\ntranscendental term, and as a consequence it immediately signifies all\npossible substances and accidents in just the same way. Therefore, if\nbeing a man (hominem esse) were something, in the first or\nsecond sense of the term \u2018something\u2019, then being a man\nwould be a substance or an accident, and so something in the third\nsense of the term\u2014that is, an atomic object (or categorial\nitem). If the supporters of Gregory\u2019s opinion were to claim that\n\u2018something\u2019 is not a transcendental term\u2014remarks\nPaul\u2014, it would follow that \u2018something\u2019 would be\neither less general than a transcendental term or more general. In the\nfirst case, the logical consequence is that the term\n\u2018something\u2019 signifies a categorial item, and thus it still\nfollows that if being a man is something in the first or second way,\nit is something in the third way. In the second case, it follows that\n\u2018something\u2019 is more general than \u2018being\u2019, and\ntherefore that the following inference is invalid:\n\n\n\u00abif being a man is something, then being a man is\u00bb,\n\n\na consequence which is the opposite of what Gregory intended to hold\n(LM, II, tr. 11, pp. 96\u201398).\n\nThe second main philosophical argument against Gregory\u2019s theory\nis meant to show that what is signified by a sentence (or complex\nexpression) cannot be qualified as a thing. Paul explicitly denies\nthat, according to Aristotle, whatever is signifiable by a complex is\na thing (ibidem, p. 104).\n\nFrom a theological point of view, the main inconvenience arising from\nGregory\u2019s opinion is that there would be many eternal things\nnone of which is God\u2014a thesis condemned at Paris in 1277. In\nfact\u2014argues Paul\u2014this complexe significabile,\nthat God is, is a thing different from God Himself, according to\nGregory, and it is from eternity (ibidem, p. 100).\n\nIn sum, Paul agrees with Gregory that what is signified by a simple\nexpression is different from what is signified by a complex\nexpression, and that what is signified by a complex expression is also\nreal, but disagrees with him about the meaning of the term\n\u2018res\u2019. In his view, only positive beings are\nthings, and what is signified by a complex expression is not a\npositive being, as it is not an item in one of the ten categorial\nlines. In other words, according to Paul, even though states of\naffairs are not really, but only formally, different from individual\nthings, they cannot in any way be regarded as things in the world.\n\nAs a consequence, the chief feature of Paul\u2019s theory of the\ncomplexe significabile is his claim that the adequate\nsignificate of a proposition is really identical-to and somehow (and\nmore precisely, formally) distinct-from what is signifiable by the\nsubject-term and/or the predicate-term alone (ibidem, p.\n156). All the other theses derive from this, which is the cornerstone\nof his theory of the proposition.\n\nPaul defines the propositio as a well formed (congrua) and\ncomplete (perfecta) mental sentence, which signifies the true\nor the false (LM, pars II, tractatus de\npropositione, fol. 101rb\u2013va), and sums up his position on\nthe problem of truth and falsity in four points:\n\nif the adequate significate of a proposition is true and it is not\ninconsistent that the proposition, thus adequately signifying, should\nbe true, then the proposition is true;\nif a proposition, adequately signifying that things are in some\nway, is true, then its adequate significate is true;\nif the adequate significate of a proposition is false, then the\nproposition is false;\nif a proposition is false, and it is not inconsistent that its\nadequate significate is false, then its adequate significate is false\n(LM, II, tr. 10, p. 62).\n\n\nThe obvious consequence of these rules is that, with the sole\nexception of insolubilia, which are called false not because\nthey signify the false, but because they affirm themselves to be false\nor not to be true, all the other kinds of proposition are true if and\nonly if what they signify is true, and false if and only if what they\nsignify is false (ibidem, p. 64).\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Paul explains that the\ndirect and adequate objects of propositions, which make them true, are\nmolecular things (res complexae) existing outside the soul.\nSuch entities are complexe significabilia, the\nsignificata of propositions, that is extramental realities\nmade up of a subject-form and a predicate-form linked together in one\nand the same substance or set of substances (In Cat., cap.\nde subiecto et praedicato, fol. 48ra). Thus, Paul\u2019s\napproach to the question of the truth of a proposition is ontological,\nas is Gregory\u2019s, since according to him the true is an attribute\nof things and only secondarily of thought, but at the same time it is\nconsistent with the fundamental principle of every form of\ncorrespondence theory of truth, that of the isomorphism of language,\nthought, and the world. In fact, in his commentary on the\nMetaphysics Paul distinguishes three different but connected\nkinds of truth: truth of imitation (veritas imitationis),\ntruth of disclosure (veritas manifestationis), and relational\ntruth (veritas respectiva). The first type of truth is the\nmeasure of the conformity (adaequatio) which all the things\nhave in relation to their corresponding ideas in the mind of God, from\nwhich they derive. The second type is also a real property of\nextramental things, which measures their various degrees of\ndisposition to be apprehended by our intellect. Relational truth,\nunlike the first two veritates, is not an absolute property\nof things, but, just as its name suggests, a relation, and more\nprecisely a relation of conformity which has its substrate of\nexistence in our intellect, its fundamentum in mental\nsentences, and its terminus ad quem in the molecular objects\nexisting outside the soul. Despite the fact that it is related to the\nactivity of the intellect, the veritas respectiva is the\neffect caused in our intellect by the existence of the veritas\nmanifestationis. If things were not intelligible by themselves,\nthey could not be grasped and recognised by our intellect for what\nthey are (In Metaph., lib. VI, cap. 4, fol. 233rb\u2013va).\nSo, like Gregory, Paul also supports the idea that human knowledge is\ntrue only qua knowledge of the ontological truth, and that\nsentences are true only in so far as they are signs of the ontological\ntruth.\n\nOn the basis of this account, what then is the relationship that holds\nbetween atomic objects (the incomplexa or categorial items)\nand molecular objects (or complexa or complexe\nsignificabilia)? And what is (if anything is) the significate of\na false proposition? Paul answers these questions in the Logica\nMagna and in the commentary on the Categories. His\nconception undergoes a certain development: in the Logica\nMagna he denies that what is signified by a true negative\nproposition is something real, since it is neither an atomic being,\nnor an aggregate, nor a molecular being (II, tr. 11, p. 122). In the\ncommentary on the Categories he modifies his opinion on this\nsubject, since he admits that there are in re a kind of\nnegative state of affairs signified by true negative propositions.\nMoreover, he now identifies the significate of any false sentence with\na second mental proposition existing obiective and not\nsubiective in our intellect.\n\nThe thesis of the Logica Magna that what is signified by a\ntrue negative proposition is not something real was not consistent\nwith the universal principle adopted by Paul in this context: a\nsentence is true if and only if it is a signum veri, nor with\nwhat he affirms about the reality of what is signified by a true\naffirmative sentence, which he identifies with the molecular truth\nwhich derives from the veritas manifestationis proper to the\natomic beings, and which is at the same time really identical-with and\nformally distinct-from them (ibidem, pp. 156 and 166).\n\nIt is clear that if he was not also able to give a form of reality to\nthe significata of true negative sentences, they could not be\nconsidered true, but, paradoxically, would be false, because they\nwould be without any referent in reality. For this reason in the\ncommentary on the Categories Paul distinguishes between the\nsignificate of a true sentence and the significate of a false\nsentence. Paul persists in thinking that if there is no adequate\nsignificatum in the world, that is, if there is not something\ncomplex to which the mental proposition refers in extramental reality,\nthen the uttered sentence and the mental proposition are false, but he\nnow accepts Burley\u2019s idea that there are two different kinds of\nmental expressions, those which exist subiective in the\nintellect, as its acts of understanding, and those which exist\nobiective in it, as the direct objects of those acts of\nunderstanding. According to Paul, the mental proposition existing\nobiective in our intellect is the significatum ultimum et\nadaequatum of false propositions (In Cat., cap. de\npriori, fol. 136vb).\n\nAs far as true propositions, both affirmative and negative, are\nconcerned, the case is different. In Paul\u2019s opinion, a true\naffirmative proposition signifies a molecular truth, that is a complex\nreality which is part of the whole reality (the esse reale of\nthe Summa philosophiae naturalis\u2014see below) of a finite\ncorporeal being. So, like Gregory, Paul denies that what verifies the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is white\u2019 is Socrates and the\naccidental form of whiteness taken together. On the contrary, he\nclaims that the significatum adaequatum of that proposition\nis the whole reality of Socrates or his being white (LM, II,\ntr. 11, p. 170). In fact, if the realities signified by true\npropositions were aggregates made up of the two entities signified by\nthe subject-term and the predicate-term, then these two propositions,\n\u2018the sun heats the house\u2019 and \u2018the house is heated\nby the sun\u2019, would be interchangeable not only with respect to\ntheir reference, but also wth respect to their significates, because\nwhat verifies both of them would be the existence of the sun, the\nhouse, and the action of heating. But according to Paul, the two\npropositions are only extensionally equivalent, and intensionally\ndifferent, because of their own different significata\n(ibidem). \u2018The sun heats the house\u2019 signifies a\nstate (of affairs) connected with the being of the sun, but \u2018the\nhouse is heated by the sun\u2019 signifies a state (of affairs)\nconnected with the being of the house. Thus it is incorrect that,\naccording to Paul, the significate with which the adequate significate\nof a proposition can be in fact identified is the one thing that, by\nbeing in a certain state, renders the proposition true. It is quite\nthe opposite: a certain state of the thing signified by the subject of\nthe sentence is the adequate significate of that same sentence. Paul\nmaintains (1) that the adequate significate of a proposition is,\nimplicitly or explicitly, determined by the composition of its parts,\nand (2) that it is impossible for the adequate significate of a simple\nexpression (a term) to be the adequate significate of a complex\nexpression (a proposition), since otherwise, an absolutely simple term\nwould adequately signify the true or the false\u2014an evident\nabsurdity (LM, II, tr. 11, p. 196). So, in order to be\nconsistent with these claims, in the commentary on the\nCategories Paul states that true negative propositions too\nhave something complex which corresponds to them in reality, a sort of\nnegative state of affairs grounded (1) in the two esse realia\nproper to the things signified by the subject and predicate-terms, or\n(2) in the laws which rule the order and the metaphysical structure of\nthe world (In Cat., cap. de substantia, fol.\n66ra).\n",
