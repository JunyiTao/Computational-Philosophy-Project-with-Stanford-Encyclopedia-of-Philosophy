    "main_text": "Three-self Theories || Trope-Constitution Monotheism\n2.4 Trope-Constitution Monotheism\n\nWilliam Hasker (2013b) has constructed what is arguably the most\ndeveloped three-self theory of the Trinity. As with Swinburne, his\nthoughts have developed over decades (Tuggy 2013b), but this entry\nwill focus on his recent publications. For Hasker, following\nPlantinga, the Persons of the Trinity are \u201cdistinct centers of\nknowledge, will, love, and action\u2026persons in some full\nsense of the term\u201d (22; cf. Chapter 24). Hasker argues that such\na view is widespread in ancient sources, including Gregory of Nyssa\nand Augustine (Chapters 4\u20135, 9). While we can\u2019t reasonably\nretain the ancient doctrine of divine simplicity (Chapter 7, 2016,\n2018a, 7\u20138, 18\u20139), we ought to uphold as many of the\ntraditional claims as possible, for we should assume divine guidance\nof theological development, even though \u201cthe Church\u2019s\ndoctrine of the Trinity is not as such to be found in the New\nTestament\u201d (8). The \u201cfathers\u201d of the late fourth\ncentury should be seen as \u201cthe giants on whose shoulders we need\nto stand\u201d (10). In the second part of his book (Chapters\n11\u201320) Hasker interacts with a number of Trinity theories,\nattempting to salvage whatever is correct in them for use in his own\nthree-self theory; he incorporates ideas particularly from Leftow,\nCraig, Rea, and Swinburne.\n\nFor Hasker, the Persons of the Trinity are three divine selves\n(Chapters 22\u20135). Against a modern Protestant trend, Hasker\ninsists that a doctrine of processions must be retained, arguing that\nit enjoys \u201csignificant support\u201d from scripture (217), and\nhe points out the awkwardness accepting \u201cthe main results of the\n[ancient] trinitarian controversy\u201d while thinking that this\n\u201cdevelopmental process\u2026had at its heart a fundamentally\nwrong assumption\u201d, that is, that the Son and Spirit exist\nbecause of the Father (222\u20133).\n\nHasker spends several chapters (25\u20138) addressing the question:\n\u201cin virtue of what do the three persons constitute one\nGod?\u201d (203). The three enjoy some sort of unity of will and\nfellowship, and they are united in that the second and third exist and\nhave the divine nature because of the first, but such factors\ndon\u2019t, by themselves, imply that they somehow amount to a single\ngod. Hasker holds that a crucial factor is the idea of their shared\ndivine nature as a concrete property or trope. Following Craig,\nsometimes Hasker characterizes this concrete divine nature as a divine\nmind or soul. He argues that for all we know, it is possible for one\nsuch trope of divinity \u201cto support simultaneously three distinct\nlives\u201d which belong to the Persons (228). He argues that this\npossibility is indirectly supported by split-brain and\nmultiple-personality phenomena in human psychology. He takes these to\nshow that \u201cIt is possible for a single concrete human\nnature\u2013a single trope of humanness\u2013to support\nsimultaneously two or more centers of consciousness\u201d (236).\n\nThis supporting or sustaining relation, Hasker says, may optionally be\nspecified to involve the divine nature constituting each Person\n(Chapter 28).\n\nWe shall say, then, that the one concrete divine nature sustains\neternally the three distinct life-streams of the Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit, and that in virtue of this the nature constitutes\neach of the persons although it is not identical with the\npersons. (244)\n\n\nConstitution is defined here as asymmetric, so none of the Persons\nalso constitutes the divine nature (245). In a later discussion, he\nseems to make constitution central to the theory (Hasker 2018a).\nAdapting work on the metaphysics of material constitution by Lynne\nRudder Baker, Hasker offers this definition:\n\nSuppose x has F as its primary kind, and y has G as its primary kind.\nThen x constitutes y just in case\n\nx and y have all their parts in common;\nx is in \u201cG-favorable circumstances\u201d;\nnecessarily, if an object of primary kind F is in G-favorable\ncircumstances there is an object of primary kind G that has all its\nparts in common with that object; and\nit is conceptually possible for x to exist but for there to be no\nobject of primary kind G that has all its parts in common with x.\n(Hasker 2018a, 16\u20137, cf. 2013b, 241\u20133; Howard-Snyder\n2015b, 108\u20139)\n\n\nApplying this doctrine of non-material constitution to the Trinity, to\nsay that the divine nature constitutes the Father is to say that those\nhave all their parts in common and that the nature is in\ndivine-Person-favorable circumstances. For a thing of the type\n\u201cdivine mind/soul or concrete nature\u201d to be in\n\u201cdivine trinitarian Person\u201d-favorable circumstances means\nthat there is a divine trinitarian Person which has all his parts in\ncommon with the first thing, and that it is conceivable that the first\nthing exists even though there is nothing of the type \u201cdivine\ntrinitarian Person\u201d that has all its parts in common with it.\nHasker clarifies that in his view all the entities mentioned here are\nsimple (lacking in proper parts), so each will be what metaphysicians\ncall an improper part of one another, satisfying condition i. He also\nclarifies that the conceptual possibility in condition iv does not\nimply metaphysical possibility; Hasker denies that this is\nmetaphysically possible: the divine nature exists but no divine Person\nexists (18). He adds that\n\nThe divine nature constitutes the divine trinitarian Persons when it\nsustains simultaneously three divine life-streams, each life-stream\nincluding cognitive, affective, and volitional states. Since in fact\nthe divine nature does sustain three such life-streams simultaneously,\nthere are exactly three divine Persons. (2018a, 17)\n\n\nPresumably, the divine-Person-favorable circumstances which the divine\nnature is in, is support of these life-streams.\n\nHasker argues that the \u201cgrammar\u201d of the Trinity forbids a\nChristian from saying things like \u201cthree gods\u201d based on\nthere being three Persons each of which is divine (2013b, 247). Again,\nalthough \u201cGod\u201d in the New Testament nearly always refers\nto the Father, one can\u2019t infer that the Father and God are\nnumerically one (248). With a nod to a mereological account of the\nPersons and God, he says that \u201cEach Person is wholly God, but\neach Person is not the whole of God\u201d (250; cf. 257). Hasker also\nargues, plausibly, that the \u201cAthanasian\u201d creed can be read\nas non-paradoxical if we realize that it is laying down rules about\nwhat must be said and what must not be said (250\u20134).\n\nIn the end, as with Swinburne, the Trinity which is called\n\u201cGod\u201d is not literally a god, as it is not divine. But\nHasker suggests that\n\n\u2026in virtue of the closeness of their union, the Trinity is at\ntimes referred to as if it were a single person. The Trinity is\ndivine, exhibiting all the essential divine attributes\u2014not by\npossessing knowledge, power, and so on distinct from those of the\ndivine persons, but rather in view of the fact that the Trinity\nconsists precisely of those three persons and of nothing else. It is\nthis Trinity which we are to worship, and obey, and love as our Lord\nand our God. (2013b, 258)\n\n\nIn an attack on theories of divine simplicity, in which he sets aside\nconsiderations of God as Trinity, Hasker objects that if God is\nsimple, God is \u201cdehumanized\u201d in that God must lack certain\nqualities which Christians should think God literally shares with\nhuman beings, such as caring for and being responsive to his\ncreatures, and being able to either judge or forgive them (2016,\nSection 5). But while none of those qualities implies being human,\neach arguably implies selfhood. Yet Hasker denies that God is\nliterally a self.\n\nBrian Leftow points out the oddness of ascribing a soul to God the\nTrinity.\n\nThis [soul] is not God. It is not a Person either. It is some other\nsort of concrete divine individual. We had not suspected that a spirit\ncould have a soul; lo, God does! (Leftow 2018, 10)\n\n\nLeftow also objects that the sentence \u201cGod is the ultimate\nreality\u201d seems to be true by definition. But on Hasker\u2019s\ntheory, this soul (a.k.a. the divine nature), which is not God, would\nbe the ultimate reality, being the source of the Persons and so of God\n(the Trinity) (12). Again, Leftow objects that this theory is not\nmonotheistic; rather, the theory features three deities which we\ncan\u2019t describe as such because there is one object (the divine\nnature/soul) which constitutes them (15).\n\nDaniel Howard-Snyder objects that Hasker\u2019s talk of the nature\n\u201csupporting\u201d or \u201csustaining\u201d the lives or\n\u201clife-streams\u201d of the Persons is unintelligible (2015b,\n108\u201310). He also argues that it is unclear quite what\nconstitutes the Persons, as in various places Hasker says that this is\nthe divine mind/soul, the concrete divine nature (a trope of\ndivinity), and a single mental substance\u2013and these would appear\nto be different claims (110). Also, monotheism uncontroversially\nimplies that there is exactly one god. But Hasker forbids saying that\nany of the Persons is a god. And by definition being a god implies\nhaving the divine nature, and like others Hasker understands divinity\nto imply perfection in knowledge, power to intentionally act, and\nmoral goodness\u2013thus, divinity implies being a self. This,\nHoward-Snyder says, is a necessary truth and one with which basically\nall Christians agree. But Hasker\u2019s \u201cGod\u201d, whether\nthis is a community or a composite object, is not a self, and so is\nnot literally divine. But then, we\u2019ve run out of candidates for\nbeing the only god; if neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Spirit\nis a god, then it would seem that for Hasker there is no god!\nAnticipating monotheism-related objections, Hasker lobs various\ncharges at Howard-Snyder (112\u20133), but in the end it seems that\nHasker\u2019s view is just that \u201cGod\u201d can be spoken of\nas if it were a self (114\u20135). Taking a term from recent\nphilosophy of mind, Howard-Snyder says that for Hasker God is a\n\u201czombie\u201d, a merely apparent self which in fact lacks any\nconsciousness, any point of view, and any mentality (114). He\nconcludes that Hasker is not aiming for the sober metaphysical truth\nabout the Trinity but is instead settling for some sort of\n\u201cas-ifery\u201d. How, he asks, could it be more accurate to\ndescribe God as \u201comnipotent and omniscient\u201d than it is to\ndescribe God as \u201cpowerless and ignorant\u201d when on\nHasker\u2019s account God is straightforwardly the latter? (115)\n\nHasker replies that his claim that the divine nature supports the\nlives of the Persons is no more unintelligible than is the claim that\n\u201cmy desktop computer supports word processing\u201d; to support\nis to \u201cmaintain in being or in action; to keep up, keep\ngoing\u201d (Hasker 2018a, 11). Nor should it worry us that we\ncan\u2019t understand how this supporting works (12).\n",
