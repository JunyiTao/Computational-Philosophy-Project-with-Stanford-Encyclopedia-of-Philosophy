Decision Theory: Is It Rational to Choose Transformative Experiences?\n\nTransformative experiences present several challenges for traditional\nmodels of decision theory. First, the epistemically transformative\ncomponent of the transformative experience involves a lack of\n\u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d knowledge. Purportedly, this in\nturn involves a type of uncertainty that is different from the type of\nuncertainty decision theory is designed to handle. Second, the\npersonally transformative component means that the post-transformation\nperson may be extremely different from the pre-transformed person.\nTheir preferences may radically change in unpredictable ways, and\ndecision procedures must find a way to accommodate these changing\npreferences. Third, the personal transformation may be so extreme that\nthe pre-transformed person considering whether to undergo the\ntransformative experience can\u2019t make the decision in the\nstraightforwardly self-interested way that\u2019s presupposed in\nstandard decision-making models. Any of these challenges make using\ndecision-making procedures impossible in the case of transformative\nexperience. And if that\u2019s the case, then it looks like one\ncan\u2019t rationally choose to undergo a transformative\nexperience\u2014the choice is either arational or irrational. Given\nthat so many of our momentous choices in life involve potentially\ntransformative outcomes, it would be disturbing if we discovered that\nthese choices could not be made rationally.\n",
