    "main_text": "Philosophy || Time and Backward Causation\n2.1 Time and Backward Causation\n\nCan metaphysics provide a notion of time that allows that the\neffect precede its cause? Answering this question, one may argue,\non the one hand, as Maudlin (2002, p. 184) does, that in case we allow\nbackward and forward causation to be parts of our description of the\nworld, the \u201cmetaphysical picture of the past generating the future\nmust be abandoned, and along with it the mathematical tractability of\nlocal theories.\u201d On the other hand, one may argue, as Evans (2015)\namong others does, that backward causation is not \u201cprecluded by the\nknown structure of reality.\u201d Indeed, Evans\u2019s claim presupposes that\nthe future is ontologically on par with the past and that basic\nphysical laws are time symmetric such that the influence of a physical\nprocess may under certain special conditions reach backwards in\ntime.\n\nA proper notion of backward causation requires that the future is just\nas real as the present and the past. It is common among metaphysicians\nto distinguish between three different views on time. The first is\npresentism. This view claims that only events that exist now\nreally exist. Past or future events do not exist. Past events have\nceased to exist, whereas future events are yet to become real. So only\nstatements about the present or related to the present have a definite\ntruth value. The second view is possibilism according to\nwhich both past and present events exist, but future events are still\nonly possible or non-existing. This view is sometimes called the\ngrowing block universe. As a consequence, the view holds that\nonly statements about past and present events have a definite\ntruth-value, but statements about the future are either probably true\nor may completely lack any truth-value. Finally, the third view is\ncalled eternalism, also named the block universe.\nThis position maintains that every past, present and future event\ntenselessly exists at a certain time and that statements\nabout these events therefore have a definite truth-value at every\nother time.\n\nUsually, presentism and the growing block universe are associated with\nthe dynamic view of becoming. The transient now plays an ontological\nrole as the ever changing time in which things become real or perhaps,\nif you are a presentist, cease to exist. One reason to prefer the\ngrowing block universe from presentism may be the analysis of forward\ncausation. In order for a present event to be caused by a past event,\nthe past event must exist. Nothing, which does not exist in the past,\ncan cause something that presently exists. By the same token, if the\nbackward causation is a conceptual possibility, something must exist\nin the future in order for it to cause something in the present.\n\nThus, backward causation demands eternalism or a static account of\ntime in the sense that there is no objective becoming, no coming into\nbeing such that future events exist on the par with present and past\nevents. It means that the future is real, the future does not merely\nconsist of unrealised possibilities or even nothing at all. Ordinarily\nwe may think of the past as a nothing that once was a something. But\nwhen asked what makes sentences about the past true or false, we would\nprobably also say that it is the facts of the past that make present\nsentences about the past either true or false. The fact that I went to\nthe cinema yesterday makes it true today when I say that I went to the\ncinema yesterday. This view is a realist one with respect to the past.\nIf backward causation is to be conceptually possible, it forces us to\nbe realists with respect to the future. The future must contain facts,\nevents with certain properties, and these facts can make sentences\nabout the past/future true or false. Such a realist account is\nprovided by static and tenseless theories of time. Eternalism is such\na theory and holds that the participation of time into the past, the\npresent and the future depends on the perspective we human beings put\non the world. The attribution of pastness, presentness and futureness\nto events is determined by what we take to exist at times earlier than\nand times later than the time of our experience.
