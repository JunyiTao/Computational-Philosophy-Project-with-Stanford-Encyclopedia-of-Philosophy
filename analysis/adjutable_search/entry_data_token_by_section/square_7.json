    "main_text": "The (Ir)relevance of Syllogistic\n3. The (Ir)relevance of Syllogistic\n\n\nOne central concern of the Aristotelian tradition in logic is the\ntheory of the categorical syllogism. This is the theory of\ntwo-premised arguments in which the premises and conclusion share\nthree terms among them, with each proposition containing two of\nthem. It is distinctive of this enterprise that everybody agrees on\nwhich syllogisms are valid.  The theory of the syllogism partly\nconstrains the interpretation of the forms. For example, it determines\nthat the A form has existential import, at least if\nthe I form does. For one of the valid patterns (Darapti) is:\n\nEvery C is B \nEvery C is A \nSo, some A is B\n\n\n\nThis is invalid if the A form lacks existential\nimport, and valid if it has existential import. It is held to be\nvalid, and so we know how the A form is to be\ninterpreted. One then naturally asks about the O\nform; what do the syllogisms tell us about it? The answer is that they\ntell us nothing.  This is because Aristotle did not discuss weakened\nforms of syllogisms, in which one concludes a particular proposition\nwhen one could already conclude the coresponding universal.  For\nexample, he does not mention the form:\n\nNo C is B \nEvery A is C \nSo, some A is not B\n\n\n\nIf people had thoughtfully taken sides for or against the validity of\nthis form, that would clearly be relevant to the understanding of\nthe O form.  But the weakened forms were typically\nignored.\n",
