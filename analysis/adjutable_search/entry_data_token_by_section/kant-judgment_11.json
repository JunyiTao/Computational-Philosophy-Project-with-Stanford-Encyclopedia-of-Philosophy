In our discussion\nof the B Deduction (see the supplement\n Completing the Picture of Kant\u2019s Metaphysics of Judgment)\n it was noted that Kant\u2019s argument for the objective validity of\nthe categories will go through only if all the objects of human\nintuition are necessarily also objects of human experience,\nthat is, are necessarily also objects correctly represented\nby true judgments of experience, that is, are necessarily\nalso objects falling under all of the categories, or at the\nvery least under the principle of the Second Analogy of Experience,\nwhich provides the criterion of the objectivity of objects of\nexperience. But if this claim fails, then there can in principle be\nnomologically ill-behaved or \u201crogue\u201d objects of human\nintuition that fall outside the scope of judgments of experience and\nthus also outside the categories, or at least outside the scope of the\nSecond Analogy. As several Kant-interpreters have pointed out, given\nthe possibility of essentially non-conceptual intuitions, then the B\nDeduction is in big trouble (Kitcher 1990, Hanna 2016b). More\nprecisely, Kant\u2019s non-conceptualism entails that there can be\nobjectively valid empirical intuitions that are both autonomous from\nand also independent of concepts, and thereby directly refer to\nobjects. Since the cognition of these objects does not require either\nconcepts or the faculty of understanding, and since these intuitions\nconsciously represent objects over and above any conceptual content\nwhatsoever, then some of these intuitions can pick out rogue objects\nthat fall outside the constraints of all the categories, and thereby\noutside the constraints of the Second Analogy in particular. So it is\nnot true that the categories and principles of pure understanding\nnecessarily apply to all objects of conscious human\nperception, and the categorial anarchy of at least some sensory\nobjects is really possible. Therefore the B Deduction is unsound. \n",
