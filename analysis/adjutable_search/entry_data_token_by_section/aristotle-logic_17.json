    "main_text": "Demonstrations and Demonstrative Sciences || Aristotelian Sciences\n6.1 Aristotelian Sciences\n\nThe subject of the Posterior Analytics is\nepist\u00eam\u00ea. This is one of several Greek words that\ncan reasonably be translated \u201cknowledge\u201d, but Aristotle is\nconcerned only with knowledge of a certain type (as will be explained\nbelow). There is a long tradition of translating\nepist\u00eam\u00ea in this technical sense as\nscience, and I shall follow that tradition here.\nHowever, readers should not be misled by the use of that word. In\nparticular, Aristotle\u2019s theory of science cannot be considered a\ncounterpart to modern philosophy of science, at least not without\nsubstantial qualifications.\n\nWe have scientific knowledge, according to Aristotle, when we\nknow:\n\nthe cause why the thing is, that it is the cause of this, and that\nthis cannot be otherwise. (Posterior Analytics I.2)\n\n\nThis implies two strong conditions on what can be the object of\nscientific knowledge:\n\nOnly what is necessarily the case can be known scientifically\nScientific knowledge is knowledge of causes\n\n\nHe then proceeds to consider what science so defined will consist in,\nbeginning with the observation that at any rate one form of science\nconsists in the possession of a demonstration\n(apodeixis), which he defines as a \u201cscientific\ndeduction\u201d:\n\nby \u201cscientific\u201d (epist\u00eamonikon), I mean\nthat in virtue of possessing it, we have knowledge.\n\n\nThe remainder of Posterior Analytics I is largely concerned\nwith two tasks: spelling out the nature of demonstration and\ndemonstrative science and answering an important challenge to its very\npossibility. Aristotle first tells us that a demonstration is a\ndeduction in which the premises are:\n\ntrue\nprimary (prota)\nimmediate (amesa, \u201cwithout a\nmiddle\u201d)\nbetter known or more familiar\n(gn\u00f4rim\u00f4tera) than the conclusion\nprior to the conclusion\ncauses (aitia) of the conclusion\n\n\nThe interpretation of all these conditions except the first has been\nthe subject of much controversy. Aristotle clearly thinks that science\nis knowledge of causes and that in a demonstration, knowledge of the\npremises is what brings about knowledge of the conclusion. The fourth\ncondition shows that the knower of a demonstration must be in some\nbetter epistemic condition towards them, and so modern interpreters\noften suppose that Aristotle has defined a kind of epistemic\njustification here. However, as noted above, Aristotle is defining a\nspecial variety of knowledge. Comparisons with discussions of\njustification in modern epistemology may therefore be misleading.\n\nThe same can be said of the terms \u201cprimary\u201d,\n\u201cimmediate\u201d and \u201cbetter known\u201d. Modern\ninterpreters sometimes take \u201cimmediate\u201d to mean\n\u201cself-evident\u201d; Aristotle does say that an immediate\nproposition is one \u201cto which no other is prior\u201d, but (as I\nsuggest in the next section) the notion of priority involved is likely\na notion of logical priority that it is hard to detach from\nAristotle\u2019s own logical theories. \u201cBetter known\u201d has\nsometimes been interpreted simply as \u201cpreviously known to the\nknower of the demonstration\u201d (i.e., already known in advance of\nthe demonstration). However, Aristotle explicitly distinguishes\nbetween what is \u201cbetter known for us\u201d with what is\n\u201cbetter known in itself\u201d or \u201cin nature\u201d and\nsays that he means the latter in his definition. In fact, he says that\nthe process of acquiring scientific knowledge is a process of\nchanging what is better known \u201cfor us\u201d, until we\narrive at that condition in which what is better known in itself is\nalso better known for us.\n",
