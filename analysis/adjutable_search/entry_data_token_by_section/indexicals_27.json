    "main_text": "Other Topics Concerning Indexicals || Complex Demonstratives\n5.3 Multiple Occurrences of Demonstratives\n\n\nMultiple occurrences of demonstratives present difficulties for some\ntheories. Sentence (26) below contains multiple occurrences of the\ndemonstrative \u2018that\u2019.\n\n(26)\n\nThat is not identical with that.\n\n\n\n\nIn the right circumstances, a speaker could use (26) to assert a\ntrue proposition. This strongly suggests that (26) is true in some\ncontexts. But \u2018that\u2019 is unambiguous, and so has a single\nlinguistic meaning. If linguistic meaning determines reference in a\ncontext (in the way that Kaplan\u2019s characters do), then all\noccurrences of \u2018that\u2019 in (26) have the same reference with\nrespect to any given context. So, (26) should be false in all\ncontexts.\n\n\nKaplan\u2019s theories of true demonstratives allow sentences that\nresemble (26) to be false in some contexts, but at the cost of\nattributing a type of ambiguity to \u2018that\u2019. For example, on\nhis later indexical theory of demonstratives, some formal analogs of\n(26), such as (27), are true in contexts in which the first\ndemonstratum of the context is distinct from the second.\n\n(27)\n\nThat1 is not identical with that2.\n\n\n\nBut on this theory each subscripted \u2018that\u2019 has a\ndifferent character. So this theory does not identify a reasonable\ncandidate for the single linguistic meaning of the unsubscripted\nEnglish word \u2018that\u2019. This may be why Kaplan (1989b) speaks\nof the \u201cexotic ambiguity\u201d of demonstratives.\n\n\nThere are various options for responding to the problem of finding a\nsingle meaning for \u2018that\u2019. One could stipulate that each\ncontext has only one demonstratum, and say that the content of\n\u2018that\u2019 in a context is the demonstratum of the\ncontext, but then insist that the content of a sentence containing\nmultiple occurrences of demonstratives is determined not by a single\ncontext but by a sequence of contexts. Then (26) is true with respect\nto certain sequences of contexts that have different demonstrata.\nSecond, one could distinguish linguistic meaning and character.\n\u2018That\u2019 has a single linguistic meaning, but this meaning\ndoes not determine reference in a context; linguistic meaning instead\ndetermines the characters of occurrences, and these characters\ndetermine reference in a context. Third, one could move to a theory\nthat assigns contents to utterances rather than expressions.\nThis might help because every utterance of (26) contains two utterances\nof \u2018that\u2019. There are other possibilities. For discussion, see Kaplan 1989a, 1999;\nWettstein 1986; Taschek 1987; Braun 1996; Garcia-Carpintero 1998;\nSalmon 2002; Richard 2003.\n",
