    "main_text": "Nei-wai \u5167\u5916 and Gendered Differentiation || The Ritual Confinement of Nei\n3.2 The Ritual Confinement of Nei\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that to say a woman is marked as a person\nof nei training for her anticipated domestic roles of wife\nand mother is not the same as to say that these familial roles are\nsomehow insignificant ethically in Confucian philosophy. On the\ncontrary, the highest accolade for a benevolent ruler is called\n\u201cthe father and mother of the people\u201d (minzifumu\n\u6c11\u4e4b\u7236\u6bcd) indicative of parental\n parity.[4]\n The Confucian reverence for the role of mother is best shown in the\nenduring maternal icon of Mengmu (mother of Mencius) perpetuated in\ncountless didactic texts for women. Furthermore, the marriage rite,\nthat commences the spousal relationship, as proscribed in the\nLiji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d chapter, dignifies\nthe bride by requiring the groom to perform the job of a servant\nstanding by the carriage and handing the bride the strap to assist her\nin mounting. This ritual gesture is meant to convey the reverence that\nthe husband owes to the wife, since spousal affection is built on\nmutual respect and a harmonious household is foundational to a secured\nworld. As explained in the Liji, \u201cwith respect there\ncomes affection; it is with this spousal affection that the sage kings\nare able to secure the world\u201d (Liji,\n\u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\n chapter).[5]\n\nFurthermore, unlike many of the canonical thinkers in the western\nintellectual tradition from Socrates down to Kant where the inherent\ninferiority of women\u2014not in terms of the roles that women play,\nbut their in-born nature as such (e.g., the \u201cRe-Reading the\nCanon\u201d series of the Pennsylvania State University\nPress)\u2014are explicitly stated, Confucian philosophy offers no\nsuch articulation of women\u2019s in-born inferior nature, moral or\notherwise. Much of the depiction of virtuous women in the antiquity\nperiod, such as Liu Xiang\u2019s Exemplary Women\u2019s\nBiographies (Lien\u00fc zhuan; c. 18 BCE), consistently\napplies the same moral and intellectual accolades to women as they do\nto men. In other words, women in Confucian philosophy are not inferior\nby nature, nor are their gender roles indicative of their inferior\nnature.\n\nMuch of the gender hierarchy in Confucianism is derived from the\ngender markings along the spatial as well as ritual boundary of\nnei-wai. Once again, this is not to say that nei is\ninferior to wai; being associated with nei does not\nautomatically make women inferior to men, nor does the gender\nassociation of woman with nei devalue nei (Goldin\n2009: 371\u201374). But using nei-wai as a mark of gender\ndifferentiation does dictate which sphere one should inhabit.\nGender-based hierarchy is, first and foremost, embedded in the spousal\nrelationship, since the role of a wife is to follow and the\nhusband\u2019s is to lead. As the same Liji passage on the\nmarriage rite quoted earlier goes on to say,\n\n\nIn passing the front door gate, the man precedes and the woman\nfollows, and with this the right relation between husband and wife\ncommences. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nTo follow and to lead indicate more than just complementary role\ndifferentiations; they indicate power differentials as well: the one\nwho leads takes charge and the one who follows cannot initiate or\ndictate the direction of the union. Wifely subordination is both\nfunctional and gender-based. In marriage\u2014just as in any\ninstitution\u2014there are inevitable role differentiations, but the\nspousal hierarchy is gender-based, instead of capacity, merit, or age\nbased. As a person of nei, a woman can only express her\nlife\u2019s work through ritualized familial roles (i.e., daughter,\nwife, and mother); there are no non-familial roles available to her\nwithout first being mediated and thereby legitimated by the men of her\nkin. That meditating requirement constricts what is deemed possible\nfor a woman to be a properly gendered person.\n\nUnlike men, women have no non-familial roles\u2014such as friend\n(you \u53cb), scholarly knight (shi \u58eb),\nruler (jun \u541b), or minster (chen\n\u81e3)\u2014available to them. For instance, even to make friends\nand maintain friendship outside one\u2019s kin pose quite a challenge\nfor women, since the notion of \u201cfriend\u201d (you\n\u53cb) and \u201ctravel\u201d (you* \u6e38) are\nsynonymous at\n times.[6]\n For a woman to travel outside the bound of her household, it not only\nraises logistic challenges, but more importantly, requires additional\njustifications for her ritual transgression. The ritual requirements\nfor women not to traverse the bounds of the domestic are dictated in\nvarious\n Classics.[7]\n To transgress that\u2014or any ritual boundary\u2014compelling,\ncircumstantial justifications are required. Hence the gender marking\nof nei makes all non-familial roles prima facie out\nof reach for women.\n\nThe famed case of Confucius as a traveling scholarly knight spending\ndecades wandering around different states to propagate his moral\nvisions and collecting friends and disciples along the way was beyond\nthe reach for any equally talented and virtuous woman. There was\nsimply no legitimate, ethical, or normative route for women to partake\nin governance exercising political authority, except through marriage\nand only in service of patrilineage such as occupying the position of\na dowager or as the kin of a high ranking official. And even then, it\nwas problematic and precarious at best. As shown in the\nAnalects 8.20, Confucius discounted King Wu\u2019s wife as\namong the ten capable ministers (chen \u81e3) that King Wu\nboasted to have. Or, as recorded in the Analects 6.28,\nConfucius felt compelled to explain himself with a dramatic appeal to\ntian \u5929 as his witness of ritual propriety to Zilu who\nwas displeased by the encounter between Confucius and Nanzi\u2014a\npowerful concubine of Duke Ling of Wei (r. 534\u2013492\nBCE)\u2014audaciously calling herself a little\n lord![8]\n",
