    "main_text": "Critique of multiculturalism || Cosmopolitan view of culture\n3.1 Cosmopolitan view of culture\n\nSome critics contend that theories of multiculturalism are premised on\nan essentialist view of culture. Cultures are not distinct,\nself-contained wholes; they have long interacted and influenced one\nanother through war, imperialism, trade, and migration. People in many\nparts of the world live within cultures that are already cosmopolitan,\ncharacterized by cultural hybridity. As Jeremy Waldron argues,\n\u201cWe live in a world formed by technology and trade; by economic,\nreligious, and political imperialism and their offspring; by mass\nmigration and the dispersion of cultural influences. In this context,\nto immerse oneself in the traditional practices of, say, an aboriginal\nculture might be a fascinating anthropological experiment, but it\ninvolves an artificial dislocation from what actually is going on in\nthe world\u201d (1995, 100). To aim at preserving or protecting a\nculture runs the risk of privileging one allegedly pure version of\nthat culture, thereby crippling its ability to adapt to changes in\ncircumstances (Waldron 1995, 110; see also Appiah 2005, Benhabib 2002,\nScheffler 2007). Waldron also rejects the premise that the options\navailable to an individual must come from a particular culture;\nmeaningful options may come from a variety of cultural sources. What\npeople need are cultural materials, not access to a particular\ncultural structure. For example, the Bible, Roman mythology, and the\nGrimms\u2019 fairy tales have all influenced American culture, but these\ncultural sources cannot be seen as part of a single cultural structure\nthat multiculturalists like Kymlicka aim to protect.\n\nIn response, multicultural theorists agree that cultures are\noverlapping and interactive, but they nonetheless maintain that\nindividuals belong to separate societal cultures. In particular,\nKymlicka has argued that while options available to people in any\nmodern society come from a variety of ethnic and historical sources,\nthese options become meaningful to us only if \u201cthey become part\nof the shared vocabulary of social life\u2014i.e. embodied in the\nsocial practices, based on a shared language, that we are exposed\nto... That we learn...from other cultures, or that we borrow words\nfrom other languages, does not mean that we do not still belong to\nseparate societal cultures, or speak different languages\u201d (1995,\n103). Liberal egalitarian defenders of multiculturalism like Kymlicka\nmaintain that special protections for minority cultural groups still\nhold, even after we adopt a more cosmopolitan view of cultures,\nbecause the aim of group-differentiated rights is not to freeze\ncultures in place but to empower members of minority groups to\ncontinue their distinctive cultural practices so long as they wish\nto.\n",
