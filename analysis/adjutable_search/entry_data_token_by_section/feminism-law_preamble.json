    "main_text": "\n\nFeminist philosophy of law identifies the pervasive influence of\npatriarchy and masculinist norms on legal structures and demonstrates\ntheir effects on the material conditions of women and girls and those\nwho may not conform to cisgender norms. It also considers problems at\nthe intersection of sexuality and law and develops reforms to correct\ngender injustice, exploitation, or restriction. To these ends,\nfeminist philosophy of law applies insights from feminist\nepistemology, relational metaphysics and progressive social ontology,\nfeminist political theory, and other developments in feminist\nphilosophy to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant\ngendered and masculinist norms. Contemporary feminist philosophy of\nlaw also draws from diverse scholarly perspectives such as\ninternational human rights theory, postcolonial theory, critical legal\nstudies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability\nstudies.\n\nAddressing the goals of feminist philosophy of law requires theory\ndevelopment, conceptual analysis, and conceptual revision. Promoting\nfreedom and equality for women reflects a profound shift in basic\nassumptions about the nature of women and their proper place in the\nworld: a shift from inequality to equality of the sexes, along with\nre-examination of what equality itself requires. It also requires\nre-examination of the understanding of sex, gender, and gender roles.\nGiven the scope and detail of this change, feminist legal theory\nproceeds on multiple levels, from the pragmatic, concrete, and\nparticular to the conceptual and ultimately visionary. Some of this\nwriting appears in philosophy journals and monographs, but much also\nappears in journals in gender studies and feminism, generalist law\nreviews, and the many specialist law journals devoted to issues of\ngender and justice. This article begins with a brief overview of\nfundamental themes of feminist legal theory, followed by discussion of\nthe evolution of views about needed institutional changes in several\nsubstantive areas of law:  political equality, immigration, and\ncitizenship; marriage, reproductive rights, and commodification of the\nbody; protection from violence; and economic rights.\n",
