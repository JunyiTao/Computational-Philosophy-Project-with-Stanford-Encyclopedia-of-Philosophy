    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Counting welfare differently depending on temporal or modal features\n2.3 Counting welfare differently depending on temporal or modal features\n\nAnother approach to the problems in population ethics has been the\nsuggestion that the crux of the problem resides in an all too\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d morality and that the problems of population\nethics can be solved by a shift to a so-called\n\u201cperson-affecting\u201d morality (Narveson 1967, 1976, 1978;\nRoberts 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2011). This move has been especially\npopular in the context of medical ethics where many of the problems of\npopulation ethics are actualised. Examples are embryo or egg\nselection, pre-implantation genetic testing, assisted reproduction\nprograms, abortion, to mention just a few. The idea behind this\napproach is the contention\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cthe\nperson-affecting restriction\u201d or simply \u201cthe\nslogan\u201d\u2014that an outcome can only be better (or worse) than\nanother if it is better (or worse) for someone (Narveson 1967: Glover\n1977; Temkin 1993a). If a quite strict interpretation of this\nrestriction is combined with the assumption that non-existence and\nexistence are incomparable in value for a person, we may derive a view\ncalled comparativism: We should disregard the welfare of\nuniquely realisable people, that is, people who only exist in one of\nthe compared outcomes (Heyd 1988; Bykvist 1998). A person-affecting\nmorality so understood deviates from impersonal morality in important\nrespects. If there is an overlap between the populations in A\nand Z, then A is ranked as better than Z since\nthe people existing in both populations are worse off in Z as\ncompared to A and since we should disregard the welfare of\nuniquely realisable people. However, if there are different people in\nthe involved populations, such as two future populations, then the two\npopulations are ranked as equally good or as incomparable in value,\nwhich is not a very satisfactory solution to the Repugnant Conclusion.\nMoreover, comparativism implies that any very huge loss in welfare for\nuniquely realisable people is compensated by any very small gain for\nnon-uniquely realisable people. Less strict interpretations of the\nperson-affecting restriction and comparativism can to a certain extent\navoid these problems, but at the price of implying the Repugnant\nConclusion again (Arrhenius 2009a; Holtug 2004).\n\nThe comparativist interpretation of the distinction between\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d and \u201cperson-affecting\u201d theories\nis not the only one proposed in the literature. What the different\ntheories that have been proposed under the banner of a\nperson-affecting morality have in common, however, are that they are\nwelfarist theories that count people\u2019s welfare differently\ndepending on the temporal location or the modal features of their\nlives. Apart from comparativists, we have presentists who\ndraw a distinction between presently existing people and non-existing\npeople (Narveson 1973; Heyd 1988); necessitarians who\ndistinguish between people who exist or will exist irrespective of how\nwe act and people whose existence is contingent on our choices (Singer\n1993); and actualists who differentiate between people that\nhave existed, exist or who are going to exist in the actual world, on\nthe one hand, and people who haven\u2019t, don\u2019t, and\nwon\u2019t exist, on the other (Bigelow and Pargetter 1988; Warren\n1978; Parson 2002; for a critical discussion of actualism, see Carlson\n1995; Arrhenius 2000b; Bykvist 1998, 2007b; Hare 2007; Howard-Snyder\n2008). These theories, apart from problems of their own, run into\nproblems analogous to the problems of comparativism discussed above.\nFor instance, presentism, in its strict guise according to which we\nonly take into account the welfare of presently existing people,\nimplies that any very small gain for present people outweighs any loss\nfor future people, irrespective of how big it is. Again, a less strict\ninterpretations of presentism (Dasgupta 1988, 1994) can to a certain\nextent avoid this and related problems, but at the price of implying\nthe Repugnant Conclusion again.\n\nActually, it is unclear whether presentism, necessitarianism, or\nactualism can escape any of the problems discussed above in connection\nwith \u201cimpersonal\u201d theories, and in particular the\nRepugnant Conclusion. For example, assume that A is a\npopulation of present people (for example, the present people in\ncountry x) enjoying very high welfare and that B is a\nlarger population of present people (for example, the present\npopulation in country y) with very low welfare but with\nhigher total welfare than A. Which population is the better one\naccording to presentism? It all depends on which method the presentist\nselects for determining better, worse and equally good in regard to\nthe welfare of present people. Since this case involves only present\npeople, all the problems discussed above will reappear in the search\nof this method. Likewise for necessitarianism and actualism. Moreover,\nthe restriction might not help us avoid the Repugnant Conclusion but\nrather imply it given some other attractive conditions (Arrhenius\n2015).\n",
