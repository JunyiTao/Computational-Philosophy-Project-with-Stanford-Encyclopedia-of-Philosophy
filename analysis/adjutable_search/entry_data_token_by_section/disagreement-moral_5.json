    "main_text": "Metaphysical Arguments from Moral Disagreement || The Argument from Relativity\n3.1 The Argument from Relativity\n\n\nMuch of the contemporary metaethical discussion about moral\ndisagreement is inspired by John Mackie\u2019s \u201cargument from\nrelativity\u201d, which is offered in support of his nihilist\nmetaphysical claim that there are no moral facts. Mackie\u2019s\nargument is often interpreted as an inference to the best explanation.\nOn that interpretation, the existence of widespread moral disagreement\nsupports the thesis that there are no moral facts because it is implied\nby the best explanation of the disagreement. However, although that\nconstrual of Mackie\u2019s argument is quite common (e.g., Brink 1989,\n197; McGrath 2008, 90; Joyce 2010, 46 (but see also Joyce 2018); Vavova\n2014, 304; and Clarke-Doane 2020, 148), it is also questionable.\n\n\nMackie\u2019s brief presentation of his argument begins as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe argument from relativity has as its premiss the well-known\nvariation in moral codes from one society to another and from one\nperiod to another, and also the differences in moral beliefs between\ndifferent groups and classes within a complex community (1977,\n36).\n\n\nHe acknowledges that there is no direct step from the diversity to\nthe conclusion that there are no moral facts and stresses that the\ndisputes which occur in the sciences do not support analogous\nconclusions about them. To justify this mixed verdict, he stresses\nthat, while \u201cscientific disagreement results from speculative\ninferences or explanatory hypotheses based on inadequate\nevidence\u201d (1977, 36), moral disagreement should be explained in a\ndifferent way:\n\n\n[T]he argument from relativity has some force simply because the\nactual variations in the moral codes are more readily explained by the\nhypothesis that they reflect ways of life than by the hypothesis that\nthey express perceptions, most of them seriously inadequate and badly\ndistorted, of objective values. (1977, 37)\n\n\nWhat makes it questionable to construe Mackie\u2019s argument as an\ninference to the best explanation is that his way-of-life explanation\nseems completely neutral as to the existence of moral facts. The\naccount is illustrated by the claim that \u201cpeople approve of\nmonogamy because they participate in a monogamous life\u201d rather\nthan the other way round, and that view is surely consistent both with\nthe existence and the non-existence of moral facts. It is accordingly\nhard to see how the alleged superiority of Mackie\u2019s way of\nlife-explanation of moral diversity confirms the idea that it is best\nexplained by assuming that moral facts do not exist.\n\n\nWhen exploring the possibility of an alternative reconstruction, it\nis helpful to distinguish between two claims:\n\nThe best explanation of the variation in moral codes\nentails that there are no moral facts.\nThe best explanation of the variation in moral codes does not\nentail that there are moral facts.\n\n\n\nGiven the neutrality of Mackie\u2019s way of life-account relative\nto the existence of moral facts, the supposition that it offers a\nsuperior explanation of the variation does not imply (i). However, it\ndoes imply the weaker claim (ii), which is what Mackie notes by\ncontrasting the way of life-account with \u201cthe hypothesis that\n[our moral convictions] express perceptions, most of them seriously\ninadequate and badly distorted, of objective values\u201d. Can (ii) be\nused in a compelling objection to moral realism? One option is to try\nfor an indirect one which targets the grounds for being a realist,\nrather than realism itself. (ii) does not entail that the variation is\na direct reason to reject realism, but it does indicate that realism\nfails to obtain support from it. That is obviously an unsurprising\nresult, but if the way-of-life hypothesis is incorporated in a broader\ntheory, which provides the best explanation also of other aspects of\nmoral discourse, then it may deprive realists of more important sources\nof support. For example, some moral realists (e.g., Sturgeon 1988, 229,\nSmith 1994, 188, and Huemer 2016) stress that although there is plenty\nof moral disagreement, there is also some amount of convergence. Issues\nthat previously were intensely debated are currently less controversial\n(Smith mentions slavery, for example). The inspiration of these\nrealists may be the arguments for scientific realism which invoke the\n(arguably more impressive) convergence that occurs there (see Devitt\n1984 for a discussion). However, if a theory which incorporates the\nway-of-life hypothesis and at the same time remains non-committal about\nmoral facts were to provide a better explanation not only of the\ndivergence but also of the convergence among moral judgments, then\narguments for moral realism of that kind would fail. If the broader\ntheory were in addition to explain why we form moral convictions in the\nfirst place, then it would provide significant support for the core\nclaim of Gilbert Harman\u2019s much discussed argument against moral\nrealism, according to which we should not posit moral facts, as they\nare not needed in the best explanation of anything observable. (See\nHarman 1977 and Sturgeon 1988 for a realist response.)\n",
