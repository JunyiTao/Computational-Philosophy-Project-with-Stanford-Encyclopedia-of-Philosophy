    "main_text": "The Vienna Years: 1891\u20131895 || Mereology: Parts of the Content and Parts of the Object\n2.4 Mereology: Parts of the Content and Parts of the Object\n\nMetaphysics is importantly present in Content and Object, and\nparticularly important are the mereological considerations Twardowski\noffers. According to Ingarden, Content and Object offered\n\u201cthe first consistently constructed theory of objects\nmanifesting a certain theoretical unity since the times of\nscholasticism and of the \u2018ontology\u2019 of Christian\nWolff\u201d (1948, 258). One cannot literally agree with Ingarden\nconsidering the Leibnizian metaphysics in Bolzano's Athanasia\n(1827)\u2014hidden in the two-thousand pages of the\nWissenschaftslehre\u2014and Brentano's work in mereology.\nNevertheless, if the impact of Content and Object is compared\nwith that of Bolzano's or Brentano's metaphysics, things are\ndifferent. Content and Object was a fundamental contribution to\nthe renaissance of Aristotelian metaphysics\u2014metaphysics\nin the sense of a general theory of objects\u2014which led to both\nMeinong's theory of objects and to Husserl's formal ontology of parts\nand wholes in the Third Logical Investigation. The story continues,\nlater, with Le\u015bniewski's mereology and Ingarden's ontology. The\nheritage of Content and Object also includes the fact that\nTwardowski's pupils had a relation to metaphysics which was vastly\ndifferent from the approach that was typical, for instance, of the\nVienna circle (see \u0141ukasiewicz 1936). In Poland, metaphysics was\nnot rejected as nonsense, but accepted as a respectable area of\ninvestigation to be explored using rigorous methods, including\naxiomatics (see Smith 1988, 315\u20136; on Twardowski and\nmetaphysics, see Kleszcz 2016)\n\nLike anyone in pre-set theoretical times, Twardowski has a very broad\nnotion of (proper) part, covering much more than just the pieces of an\nobject. Twardowski distinguishes material and formal parts of an\nobject. The material parts of an object comprise not only the pieces\nof an object, but also anything that can be said to be a component of\nit, such as the series 1, 3, 5 is composed of three numbers (namely,\n1, 3, and 5). Among the material parts of an object are also its\nqualities (Beschaffenheiten) such as extension, weight, color,\netc. (1894, \u00a710, 58). The formal parts of an object are the\nrelations (Beziehungen) obtaining between the object and its\nmaterial parts (primary formal parts) as well as the relations\nobtaining among the material parts themselves (secondary formal parts)\n(1894, \u00a79, 48 and ff.; \u00a710, 51 and ff.). \n\nIn keeping with the tradition, Twardowski calls the matter of\nan object the sum of its material parts and the form of an\nobject the sum of its formal parts. A special kind of primary formal\nparts are (relations of) properties (Eigenschaften): these are\nrelations between an object as a whole and one of its material parts,\nconsisting in the whole's having the part at issue (1894, \u00a710,\n56). Since Twardowski accepts that among the parts of an object there\nare the relations in which that object is in, Twardowski's mereology\nis, strictly speaking, an atomless mereology: there are no simples\n(1894, \u00a712, 74). However, we can speak of atoms if we restrict\nourselves to material parts only (for instance, in the case of the\nnumber one, we can say it is a simple object only if we consider the\n(proper) material parts it has, namely zero).\n\nThe distinction between content and object enables Twardowski to\nclearly distinguish conceptualizations regarding parts of the object\nfrom conceptualizations regarding the parts of the content (as special\ncases of objects). This, in turn, enables Twardowski to offer\nsophisticated considerations, leading him among others to fix clearly\nthe notion of the characteristic mark (Merkmal, nota) of\nan object. Twardowski calls elements the parts of the content\nof a presentation; he calls characteristic marks the parts of\nthe object of a presentation (\u00a78, 46\u20137); the characteristic\nmarks of the object are presented through the elements of the content.\nThe content of a presentation is the collection of the presentations\nof the characteristic marks of the object of the presentation. The\nnotion of characteristic mark is a relative one because only the parts\nof an object that happen to be actually presented in the content of a\npresentation in someone's mind qualify as its characteristics.\n\n\nFor example, one can be presented with a table without thinking of the\nshape of its legs; in this case, the shape of the table legs is a\n(material, metaphysical) constituent (of second order), but not a\ncharacteristic of the table. But if one thinks, while being presented\nwith the table, of the shape of its legs, then the shape had to be\nconsidered a characteristic of the table. (\u00a713, 86; Eng. transl.\n81).\n\n\nAccording to Twardowski, it is not possible to present all the parts\nof an object in a presentation. Given that the number of parts of an\nobject is boundless, and that we can only present a finite amount of\ncharacteristics, the number of the elements of the content is\ntherefore lower than that of the parts of the object (\u00a712,\n78\u20139; on this point Twardowski is again indebted to Bolzano\n(Wissenschaftslehre, \u00a764). It follows that no adequate\npresentation is possible of any object (\u00a713, 83).\n\nLike Brentano had done, Twardowski distinguishes, with respect to\nmaterial parts, metaphysical from physical and logical parts on the\nbasis of a notion of dependence and\n separability.[8]\n However, differently from Brentano, Twardowski does not construe the\nnotion of dependence in terms of existence of the objects involved.\nHis notion of dependence needs also to be applicable to non-existing\nobjects. Consequently, Twardowski construes the notion of dependence\nof the parts of an object in terms of modes of presentability\nof the parts of an object, i.e. as existence of the parts of the\ncontent of a presentation (which always exists). The inseparability of\na part p1 from a part p2 of an\nobject O is not construed in the sense that it is not possible\nfor p1 to exist without p2\nexisting, but in the sense that in the content of the presentation of\nan object O the part that represents p1\ncannot exist without the part that represents p2\nexisting, that is, both must be elements of the content of the\npresentation of the object O.\n\nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are mutually separable iff A can be presented\nwithout presenting B and vice versa. Mutually separable parts\nare physical parts. For instance, the parts of the content of the\npresentations of the pages and the cover of a book are mutually\nseparable. \n\nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are one-sidedly separable iff A can be\npresented without B, but not vice versa. Logical parts are\none-sidedly separable: for instance, we can have a presentation of\ncolor without the presentation of red, but not vice versa. \n\nTwo material parts of the content of a presentation of A and\nof B are mutually inseparable (but yet distinguishable) iff\nthey are neither mutually nor one-sidedly separable. Metaphysical\nparts are mutually inseparable, e.g. you cannot present separately the\nbeing colored and the being extended of something colored and\nextended, although those parts are in abstracto distinguishable\nin the object.\n\nOn Twardowski's mereology see Cavallin (1990), Rosiak (1998) and\nSchaar (2015, 68 and ff.)\n",
