    "main_text": "Between Philosophy and Medicine\n5. Between Philosophy and Medicine\n\n\nIn 2008, Romana Martorelli Vico published the first critical edition\nof Giles\u2019 De formatione corporis humani in utero. With this\nwork, completed between 1285 and 1295, Giles took a stance in the much\ndebated question of the respective roles of male and female parents in\nconception. The Galenist view, going back to Hippocrates, was that\nboth male and female contributed sperm, so that the offspring could\nhave characteristics from both parents. On the contrary, Aristotle had\nheld that only the male alone contributed sperm containing an active\nand formal principle to conception, while the female provided only the\nmatter of the fetus. Giles was well acquainted with these different\npositions and with the efforts to reconcile the diverging approaches\nof medici and philosophi, which could be traced back to\nAvicenna. Leaning on Averroes\u2019 Colliget, however, Giles\nrejected any attempt to attribute a formal role to the female sperm,\neven if it is conceived as subordinate to the male one. On the contrary\nhe maintained that it can contribute only in a passive way to\nconception, while what was called \u201cfemale sperm\u201d, i.e., the\nvaginal secretion, has a subservient, helpful but by no means necessary\nfunction. It helps the male sperm to inseminate female matter, but does\nnot add anything essential to the new being. In this way, Giles\nintended to stress the superiority of the philosophical, theoretical\napproach to such problems with respect to the traditions of medical\nlearning, even when the latter seemed to be supported by empirical evidence\n(Hewson 1975; Martorelli Vico 1988). Empirical evidence such as the\nresemblance of the offspring to the mother was e.g., explained away as\nan example of stronger resistance of female matter to the action of\nform (Martorelli Vico 2002). After conception the human embryo begins a\ndevelopment which goes through different stages. Comparing these stages\nto the embryos of various animals Giles, like Thomas Aquinas, supported\nan interpretation of the fetal development which would be exploited\nmany centuries later by the so-called \u201crecapitulation\ntheory\u201d (Hewson 1975, 99). Giles maintained, however, that\n\u201cthe organic fetal body is not to be called a pig, a bear, or a\nmonkey, but something immediately disposed to becoming man\u201d\n(Hewson 1975, 100). This position apparently implies that human life\ndoes not fully begin at the moment of conception. Although such a\nthesis can be brought to bear on the moral judgment concerning\nabortion, Giles does not seem interested in tackling from this point of\nview an issue which would become central for what nowadays is called\nbioethics.\n",
