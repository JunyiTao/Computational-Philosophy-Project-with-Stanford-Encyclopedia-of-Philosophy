    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity\n2. Paradoxes of Identity\n\nThe concept of identity, simple and settled though it may seem (as\ncharacterized by the standard account), gives rise to a great deal of\nphilosophical perplexity. A few (by no means all) of the salient\nproblems are outlined below. These are presented in the form of\nparadoxes\u2014arguments from apparently undeniable premises to\nobviously unacceptable conclusions. The aim here is to make clear just\nwhat options are available to one who would stick close to the\nstandard account. Often (but not always) little or no defense or\ncritique of any particular option is offered. In the next section, we\nshall see what the relative identity alternative offers by\ncomparison.\n",
