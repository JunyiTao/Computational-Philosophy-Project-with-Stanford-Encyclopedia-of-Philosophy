    "main_text": "Integration versus Emigration\n9. Integration versus Emigration\n\nDouglas advocated assimilation and amalgamation, so, understandably,\nhe supported the right of black Americans to remain in the United\nStates and thought they ought to do so. Rather than leave the country\nto find homes and start lives abroad in places that they imagined\nmight provide friendlier quarters, Douglass urged black Americans to\nstay and support abolition efforts and then, in the postbellum years,\nto fight for equal rights and citizenship. He can be considered a\nprimary example of the political ideal of racial integration as\ndistinct from racial separatism. Douglass\u2019s\namalgamation-assimilationist views of the 1860s are not the\ndesegregationist and integrationist ideas associated with the U.S.\nCivil Rights movement that began around the mid-1950s. Other thinkers\nand movements influenced those views, which advocated for equal\nrights, protection, citizenship, and equal access to schools, colleges\nand universities, and neighborhoods. Yet, Douglass is a fitting icon\nfor the American integrationist impulse.\n\nIn his essay from 1848, \u201cThe Folly of Racially Exclusive\nOrganization\u201d, Douglass criticized the creation of separate\nsocieties, with distinct \u201cnegro pews, negro berths in\nsteamboats, negro cars, Sabbath or week-day schools or\nchurches\u201d, and in other social spaces and institutions (FDP1\nv.2: 110\u2013111). Formal racial segregation and informal separatism\ngenerally served the interests of the defenders of slavery; thus,\nafter the U.S. Civil War, Douglass regarded ongoing racial separatism\nas a counter to the ideals of the abolition movement. It was a message\nhe frequently repeated (1848a [FDSW: 117\u2013122]).\n\nHe opposed plans for black American emigration to Africa, the\nCaribbean, Mexico, or Latin America for similar reasons. He criticized\nthe emigrationist visions of the American Colonization Society,\nfounded by whites, and the African Civilization Society, founded by\nblacks. He had four reasons to oppose emigration schemes: First, for\nslavery to end, Douglass argued that black Americans needed to\nstruggle against it in America. Second, Americans had no other home\nbut the United States; they were uniquely American and products of\nAmerican history. Third, black Americans had a right to the property\ntheir labor had produced. By abandoning the United States, they would\nleave the land they had built. In his 1894 speech, \u201cLessons of\nthe Hour\u201d (SFD: 454\u2013497), he wrote,\n\n\nThe native land of the American Negro in America. His bones, his\nmuscles, his sinews, are all American. His ancestors for two hundred\nand seventy years have lived and laboured and died, on American soil,\nand millions of his posterity have inherited Caucasian blood. It is\ncompetent, therefore, to ask, in view of this admixture, as well as in\nview of other facts, where the people of this mixed-race are to go,\nfor their ancestors are white and black, and it will be difficult to\nfind their native land anywhere outside of the United States. (1894\n[SFD: 485]).\n\n\nFourth, according to Douglass, emigration and separation were contrary\nto historical development and the emergence of a composite nation\ncomprised of a blended people. All the same, Douglass was not opposed\nto blacks collectively acting in self-help and self-defense.\nNonetheless, his opposition to emigration displayed a downside of his\ncommitment to his natural law and manifest destiny-inspired\nprinciples. He did not appreciate enough how immigration might be more\nthan a reasonable act of self-preservation and\nself-determination\u2014in the face of anti-black life-crushing\noppression and murderous violence\u2014much like his own escape from\n slavery.[23]\n Initially, Douglass even opposed the internal migration of black\nAmericans from the southern states to the northern ones (Myers 2008).\nHowever, he moderated his position nearer the end of his life (1879\n[FDP1 v.4: 510\u2013533]; 357 [FDP1 v.5: 357\u2013373]); 1894 [SFD:\n454\u2013497]).\n",
