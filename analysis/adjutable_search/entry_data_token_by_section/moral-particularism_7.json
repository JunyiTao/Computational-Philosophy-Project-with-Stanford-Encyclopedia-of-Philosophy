    "main_text": "Do Particularism and Generalism Differ in Practice or Only in Theory?\n8. Problems for Particularism\n\n\nPeople reject the persuasive charms of particularism for, broadly, two\nsorts of reasons: reasons to do with rationality, and reasons to do\nwith motivation. I take rationality first. Three points are made. The\nfirst and most direct is that thinking rationally requires at least\nthat one think consistently, and in ethics this just means taking the\nsame feature to be the same reason wherever it occurs. Particularism,\ntherefore, denies the rationality of moral thought. Second, what is\nthe difference between moral choice and choosing chocolates? The\ndifference is that when choosing morally we are required to make\nsimilar choices in similar circumstances; not so for the choice\nbetween rum truffles and peppermint creams. Third, what account can\nthe particularist give of our ability to learn from our moral\nexperience? Such moral self-education is certainly possible. An\nadolescent who has so far refused to accept that tact is a virtue can\nbe brought to see the importance of being tactful in a particular\ncase, and is then in a position to apply this knowledge more\ngenerally. The generalist can understand this as the extraction of a\nprinciple from an earlier case, which we then apply to later\nones. What can the particularist offer as an alternative account?\n\n\nOf these three points, the third is the hardest. The answer to the\nfirst is that, when we are thinking of reasons for belief, the sort of\nconsistency required of us is merely that we do not adopt beliefs that\ncannot all be true together. Why should we understand the consistency\nrequirement in a different way when we turn to moral reasons? Simply\nto insist that this is so must be to beg the question against\nparticularism.\n\n\nThe second question asks us to justify a distinction between matters\nof whim, such as the choosing of chocolates, and matters of weighty\nreasons, such as those involved in moral choice. But this need not be\na problem. Moral reasons as the particularist understands them occur\nin the one case and not in the other. Nothing at all like them applies\nto the choosing of chocolates (normally). This does nothing to show\nthat in morality, unlike in the area of whim, we are required to make\nsimilar choices in similar situations. There are quite enough other\ndifferences between morality and whim.\n\n\nThe third question asks us what relevance other cases do have to a new\ncase, if not the sort of relevance that the generalist supposes.  The\nanswer to this is that experience of similar cases can tell us what\nsort of thing to look out for, and the sort of relevance that a\ncertain feature can have; in this way our judgement in a new case can\nbe informed, though it is not forced or constrained, by our experience\nof similar cases in the past. There is no need to suppose that the way\nin which this works is by the extraction of principles from the\nearlier cases, which we then impose on the new case.\n\n\nSo much for one sort of complaint. I now turn to questions which focus\non motivation. The general idea here is that a particularist morality\nis a lax morality: without principles, anything goes. But there are\nvarious ways in which this thought can be built up. The first is just\nto say that morality is in the business of imposing constraints on our\nchoices. For there to be constraints, there needs to be regulation,\nand regulation means rules, and rules mean principles.  This, however,\nis just wrong. There can be fully particular constraints on action,\nand the judgement that this action would be wrong is surely just such\na thing. Constraints do not need to be general constraints, any more\nthan reasons need to be general reasons.\n\n\nAnother line is that the person of principle will be unbudgeable;\nhaving taken a stand on an issue, he will not be moved from it. A\nparticularist will not be like this. But here I have two things to\nsay.  First, nothing prevents a particularist from being of firm\nconviction case by case; an unbudgeable conviction need not be founded\non principle, but simply on the nature of the case. Unbudgeability and\nprinciple have nothing essentially in common. Second, even if it were\ntrue that a principled person will on some points be unbudgeable, the\nquestion is whether those points are the right points. The worrying\nthought is that they might not be\u2014that in being driven by\nprinciple, our principled person will distort the relevance of\nrelevant features by insisting on filtering them through principles,\nin a way that is at odds with the falsehood of generalism. In my view,\nunbudgeability and principles go very badly together. Unbudgeability\nmay be a virtue in its place, but to be unbudgeably involved in a\ndistortion is not a great triumph. If you are going to be incorrigible\nyou had better always be right; incorrigible error is the worst of all\nworlds.\n\n\nA different suggestion is that morality has the sort of authority over\nus that can only be provided by a rule. Here, however, I think that\nparticularists should simply dig their heels in, and insist that moral\nreasons have all the authority they need already. She needs medical\nhelp, and I am the only person around to summon it. This situation\ndemands a certain response from me, in a way that has authority over\nme because there is nothing that I can do to get out of it.\n\n\nStill, we might say, there is the ever-present danger of backsliding\nin ethics; we see the right, but somehow cannot bring ourselves to do\nit. With principles, we have something capable of stiffening our\nwaning resolve. Without principles, we will fall short all too\noften. One answer to this is that it is an empirical hypothesis for\nwhich there is little real evidence. What is more, the need for moral\nstiffening only arises once we have already decided what morality\nrequires of us here, and the real question was whether that decision\nneeded to be based on principle. The point about backsliding does\nnothing to show that the decision from which we might otherwise slide\nneeds to have been made on principle. The supposed need for principles\ncomes after that decision, not before.\n\n\nMore to the point might be a worry about special pleading. This is\ndifferent from backsliding, because the special pleader is the person\nwho makes exceptions in their own favour. It would not be right for\nmost people to do what I propose to do, but I am special; so I am left\noff the moral hook that others are caught by. This sort of special\npleading occurs in the process of making our moral decision; it is not\nto do with motivation thereafter, as backsliding is. With backsliding\nI say \u2018this is wrong but I am going to do it all the\nsame\u2019; with special pleading I say \u2018this would be wrong\nfor others, but not for me\u2019.\n\n\nThe reason why there is a genuine worry about special pleading is that\none can always find some difference between this act and a plain duty,\nand there seems to be no way, within the resources available to\nparticularism, to prevent such differences from being appealed to by\nthose who, in bad faith, want to let themselves off the moral hook. A\nprinciple, we might say, would, or at least should, stop this sort of\nthing.\n\n\nWhat is really going on here is that we are appealing to principles to\nrectify a natural distortion in moral judgement. If such judgement\nfocuses only on the reasons present in the case before us, it is all\ntoo easy to twist those reasons to suit oneself. So we use principles\nto stop ourselves from doing that. But really the remedy for poor\nmoral judgement is not a different style of moral judgement,\nprinciple-based judgement, but just better moral judgement. There is\nonly one real way to stop oneself distorting things in one\u2019s own\nfavour, and that is to look again, as hard as one can, at the reasons\npresent in the case, and see if really one is so different from others\nthat what would be required of them is not required of oneself. This\nmethod is not infallible, I know; but then neither was the appeal to\nprinciple.\n",
