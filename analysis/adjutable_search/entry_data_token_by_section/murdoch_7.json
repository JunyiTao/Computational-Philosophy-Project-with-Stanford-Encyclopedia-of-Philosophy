    "main_text": "Moral Reality and Moral Realism || Murdoch, Sidgwick, Plato and the self/other moral framework\n5.3 Murdoch, Sidgwick, Plato and the self/other moral framework\n Though \u201cthe Good\u201d is a distinctly Platonic strand in\nMurdoch\u2019s view of moral reality, the \u201cother persons\u201d\nstrand is un-Platonic in two important ways. One is that it involves a\nsharp separation between self and other, and identifies morality with\nattention to, love of, or concern for the other and not the self.\nHenry Sidgwick articulated a standard view in Anglo-American moral\nphilosophy on this matter when he said that the field of ethics made\nan important step beyond the ancients when it articulated\nself-interest as a distinct rational principle of action that is\nseparate from a principle of the good of others, understood\nimpersonally. (He attributed this discovery to Bishop Butler.)\n(Sidgwick 1874 [1907: 404]; Sidgwick 1886 [1902: 197\u20138]; Brewer\n2009: 193). Neither Plato nor Aristotle have this exclusively\nother-focused conception of virtue, common to both Murdoch and the\ntradition Sidgwick identifies and praises. Murdoch agrees with\nSidgwick\u2019s self/other distinction as one of great moral\nsignificance, though she does not regard cognizing or caring for the\nother in terms either of rationality or principle.\n\nA second difference from Plato (and Aristotle) is Murdoch\u2019s\nrejection of the Greeks\u2019 sense that virtue and virtuous action\nare good for their agent as well as for their own sake (but the former\n\u201cgood for\u201d is not understood by Plato or Aristotle\nprudentially and is not separable from virtue being good for its own\nsake [Brewer 2009: 202]).  For Murdoch it is indeed good to act\nvirtuously, and doing so helps to constitute the agent as morally\ngood. But she does not understand this virtuousness as intrinsically\ngood for the agent. Virtue is pointless, as Murdoch often\nsays (OGG: 71/358; SGC: 78/364), and this is tied up with the view,\nwhich she sees as historically produced from Kant to Existentialism,\nthat there is no inherent purpose in human life. \u201cWe are simply\nhere\u201d with no larger purpose or telos (SGC:\n79/364). But in the face of this purposelessness, being and becoming a\nmorally good person through a suppression or transcendence of self is\nthe best aspiration we can have.\n\nDespite aligning with Sidgwick regarding the identification of\nmorality solely with an appropriate focus on the other and the\nother\u2019s welfare, not that of the self, Murdoch\u2019s view\ndiffers from Sidgwick\u2019s, as well as from much of the English\nempiricist tradition in ethics (Hutcheson, Hume, Mill), in three\ncrucial respects. First, she pays very little attention to\nself-interest as an egoistic obstacle to morality through our\nunduly privileging our own interests over those of others. For Murdoch\nthe prime self-oriented obstacle to morality is fantasy, which gets in\nthe way of our seeing the other person as a distinct, separate, other\nbeing with their own reality. Sometimes the personal fantasy idea is\nbound up with self-absorption, which keeps us from being more\nthan barely aware of others at all. More frequently it is our\ninvestment in false ideas of the (particular) other expressed in the\nfantasy idea. Neither of these, however, is self-interest as an\noverall motive or principle as Sidgwick envisages. All three (fantasy,\nself-absorption, self-interest) are egoistic but in distinct ways.\n\nA second difference from Sidgwick (and from Butler, Hume, and\nHutcheson, and the empiricist temper of British philosophy more generally)\nis Murdoch\u2019s understanding of moral realism. She is viewing\nmorality not only as calling for a greater focus on the well-being of\nothers rather than the self, but saying that doing so involves being\nin touch with, being responsive to, reality itself, while egoism\ninvolves living in falsehood, being out of touch with reality.\n\u201cThe self, the place where we live, is a place of\nillusion\u201d (SGC: 93/376). \u201cThe authority of morality is the\nauthority of truth, that is, of reality\u201d (SGC: 90f/374).\n\nDiamond and Brewer both note that Murdoch shares with both Plato and\nAristotle the view that reality is irreducibly evaluative (Diamond\n2010, 59f; Brewer 2009: 152). The identification of the Real with the\nGood is a deep part of Murdoch\u2019s view (Brewer 2009:\n152). Murdoch recognizes that the view of reality as evaluatively\ninert (in addition to human life having no telos) is an\nhistorical product, tied up with the rise of natural science, with\nKant playing a particularly important role in solidifying it within\nthe Western philosophic tradition (MGM 1992: 40). She views Kant as\ntrying to rescue value and morality in the face of this scientistic\nview of reality (MGM 1992: 50), but she entirely rejects that\n(unPlatonic) view of reality. Diamond argues that in doing so she also\nrejects the related Kantian distinction between the theoretical domain\nand the practical domain (Diamond 2010: 73).\n\nA third difference between Murdoch and the British tradition in ethics\nis that the latter largely fails to recognize the difficulty\nand psychic complexity, so central to Murdoch\u2019s view, of knowing\nthe (individual) other, and thus also often of knowing how to act\ntoward them so as to bring about their well-being. The notion of\n\u201cbenevolence\u201d as employed in that tradition is taken to\nimply that being motivated to help others is sufficient to bring about\nwhat is good for the other. Murdoch strongly rejects this view, since\nthe benevolent sentiment and motive does not guarantee an\nunderstanding of the other\u2019s reality and well-being.\n",
