    "main_text": "Appearances and Things in Themselves || Transcendental Realism and Empirical Idealism\n1.1 Transcendental Realism and Empirical Idealism\n\nOne promising place to begin understanding transcendental idealism is\nto look at the other philosophical positions from which Kant\ndistinguishes it. In the \u201cFourth Paralogism\u201d, he\ndistinguishes transcendental idealism from transcendental realism:\n\n\nTo this [transcendental] idealism is opposed transcendental realism,\nwhich regards space and time as something given in themselves\n(independent of our sensibility). The transcendental realist therefore\nrepresents outer appearances (if their reality is conceded) as things\nin themselves [Dinge an sich selbst], which would exist\nindependently of us and our sensibility and thus would also be outside\nus according to pure concepts of the understanding. (A369)\n\n\nTranscendental realism, according to this passage, is the view that\nobjects in space and time exist independently of our experience of\nthem, while transcendental idealism denies this. This point is\nreiterated later in the Critique when Kant writes:\n\n\nWe have sufficiently proved in the Transcendental Aesthetic that\neverything intuited in space or in time, hence all objects of an\nexperience possible for us, are nothing but appearances, i.e., mere\nrepresentations, which, as they are represented, as extended beings or\nseries of alterations, have outside our thoughts no existence grounded\nin itself. This doctrine I call transcendental idealism.\n The realist, in the transcendental signification, makes\nthese modifications of our sensibility into things subsisting in\nthemselves, and hence makes mere representations into\nthings in themselves [Sachen an sich selbst].\n (A491/B519)[3]\n\n\nAppearances exist at least partly in virtue of our experience of them,\nwhile the existence of things in themselves is not grounded in our\nexperience at all (cf. A369, A492/B521, A493/B522). Kant calls\ntranscendental realism the \u201ccommon prejudice\u201d (A740/B768)\nand describes it as a \u201ccommon but fallacious\npresupposition\u201d (A536/B564; cf. Allison 2004: 22).\nTranscendental realism is the commonsense pre-theoretic view that\nobjects in space and time are \u201cthings in themselves\u201d,\nwhich Kant, of course, denies.\n\nKant also distinguishes transcendental idealism from another position\nhe calls \u201cempirical idealism\u201d:\n\n\nOne would also do us an injustice if one tried to ascribe to us that\nlong-decried empirical idealism that, while assuming the proper\nreality of space, denies the existence of extended beings in it, or at\nleast finds this existence doubtful, and so in this respect admits no\nsatisfactorily provable distinction between dream and truth. As to the\nappearances of inner sense in time, it finds no difficulty in them as\nreal things, indeed, it even asserts that this inner experience and it\nalone gives sufficient proof of the real existence of their object (in\nitself) along with all this time-determination. (A491/B519)\n\n\nEmpirical idealism, as Kant here characterizes it, is the view that\nall we know immediately (non-inferentially) is the existence of our\nown minds and our temporally ordered mental states, while we can only\ninfer the existence of objects \u201coutside\u201d us in space.\nSince the inference from a known effect to an unknown cause is always\nuncertain, the empirical idealist concludes we cannot know that\nobjects exist outside us in space. Kant typically distinguishes two\nvarieties of empirical idealism: dogmatic idealism, which claims that\nobjects in space do not exist, and problematic idealism, which claims\nthat objects in space may exist, but we cannot know whether they do\n(see A377). Although he is never mentioned by name in the A Edition,\nBerkeley seems to be Kant\u2019s paradigm dogmatic idealist, while\nDescartes is named as the paradigm problematic\n idealist.[4]\n\nTranscendental idealism is a form of empirical realism because it\nentails that we have immediate (non-inferential) and certain knowledge\nof the existence of objects in space merely through\nself-consciousness:\n\n\n[\u2026] external objects (bodies) are merely appearances, hence\nalso nothing other than a species of my representations, whose objects\nare something only through these representations, but are nothing\nseparated from them. Thus external things exist as well as my self,\nand indeed both exist on the immediate testimony of my\nself-consciousness, only with this difference: the representation of\nmy Self, as the thinking subject is related merely to inner sense, but\nthe representations that designate extended beings are also related to\nouter sense. I am no more necessitated to draw inferences in respect\nof the reality of external objects than I am in regard to the reality\nof my inner sense (my thoughts), for in both cases they are nothing\nbut representations, the immediate perception (consciousness) of which\nis at the same time a sufficient proof of their reality.\n(A370\u20131)\n\n\nMerely through self-conscious introspection I can know that I have\nrepresentations with certain contents and since appearances are\n\u201cnothing other than a species of my representations\u201d this\nconstitutes immediate and certain knowledge of the existence of\nobjects in space.\n\nUnderstanding transcendental idealism requires understanding the\nprecise sense in which things in themselves are, and appearances are\nnot, \u201cexternal to\u201d or \u201cindependent\u201d of the\nmind and Kant draws a helpful distinction between two senses in which\nobjects can be \u201coutside me\u201d:\n\n\nBut since the expression outside us carries with it\nan unavoidable ambiguity, since it sometimes signifies something that,\nas a thing in itself [Ding an sich selbst], exists distinct\nfrom us and sometimes merely that belongs to outer appearance, then in\norder to escape uncertainty and use this concept in the latter\nsignificance\u2014in which it is taken in the proper psychological\nquestion about the reality of our outer intuition\u2014we will\ndistinguish empirically external objects from those\nthat might be called \u201cexternal\u201d in the transcendental\nsense, by directly calling them \u201cthings that are to be\nencountered in space\u201d. (A373)\n\n\nIn the transcendental sense, an object is \u201coutside me\u201d\nwhen its existence does not depend (even partly) on my representations\nof it. The empirical sense of \u201coutside me\u201d depends upon\nthe distinction between outer and inner sense. Inner sense is the\nsensible intuition of my inner states (which are themselves\nappearances); time is the form of inner sense, meaning that all the\nstates we intuit in inner sense are temporally ordered. Outer sense is\nthe sensible intuition of objects that are not my inner states; space\nis the form of outer sense. In the empirical sense,\n\u201couter\u201d simply refers to objects of outer sense, objects\nin space. Transcendental idealism is the view that objects in space\nare \u201couter\u201d in the empirical sense but not in the\ntranscendental sense. Things in themselves are transcendentally\n\u201couter\u201d but appearances are not.\n",
