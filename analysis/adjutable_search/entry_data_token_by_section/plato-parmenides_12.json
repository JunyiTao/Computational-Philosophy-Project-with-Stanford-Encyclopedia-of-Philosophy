The exceptions are D1A1C, D1A9C1, D1A9C2, D1A10C,\nand D1A11C, which do not depend on any previously established\nConclusions. (For details, see Rickless (2007, 112\u2013137).)\n\n\nThe Arguments of D1 also rest on a large number of independent\npremises, among which we find the following: (i) the property of being\none and the property of being many are contraries; (ii) anything that\nhas parts is many; (iii) a whole is a thing with parts from which no\npart is missing; (iv) the beginning, middle, and end of X are\nparts of\nX; (v) the beginning and end of X are the limits\nof X; (vi) to be round is to have extremities that are\nequidistant in every direction from the middle; (vii) to be straight\nis to have a middle that stands in the way of the two extremities;\n(viii) anything that has shape must be either round or straight; (ix)\nif X is in Y, then X is contained all\naround by\nY and X touches Y in many places with many\nparts; (x) if X is contained all around by Y\nand X touches Y in many places with many parts,\nthen X is round; (xi) if X touches Y in\nmany places with many parts, then X has parts; (xii)\nif X both contains itself and is contained by itself,\nthen X is two; (xiii) if X is two, then X\nis many; (xiv) whatever is neither in itself nor in another is\nnowhere; (xv) if X is in motion, then X alters from\nitself or moves spatially; (xvi) if X moves spatially,\nthen X either spins in a circle in the same location or\nchanges from one place to another.\n\n\nIt appears that every Argument of D1 other than D1A9 is logically\nvalid. (However, see Gill (1996, 81, n. 134), who contends that\nD1A12 and D1A13 are fallacious.)) D1A9 seems to commit the\nfallacy of equivocation (see Rickless (2007, 121\u2013123). It also\nappears that almost all the independent premises of D1 are, at least\nfrom Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. There are three exceptions to this claim. D1A10\ndepends on the questionable premise that if X is not different by\nitself, then X itself is not different in any way (see Rickless (2007,\n123\u2013124)), and D1A11 depends on the questionable premise that\nif the nature of the F is not identical to the\nnature of the\nG, then if X is G relative to\nitself, X is not F relative to itself (see Rickless\n(2007, 124\u2013126)).\n\n\nBut the most interesting exception is D1A1. In D1A1,\nParmenides argues for D1A1C: that if the one is, then the one is not\nmany. The reasoning is simple. From Oneness or\nSelf-Predication, it follows that the one is one. Consequently,\nif the one is, then the one is one. But the property of being one\nand the property of being many are contraries, and, by Purity-F, no\nform can have contrary properties. Given that the one is a form,\nit follows that if the one is, then the one is not many. The\nnon-obvious premises here are Oneness (or Self-Predication) and\nPurity-F. Whereas some might argue that D1A1 is unsound because\nOneness (or Self-Predication) is false, others might argue that the\nvery point of D1A1 is to show that if the one is and is many, then\nPurity-F is false.\n",
