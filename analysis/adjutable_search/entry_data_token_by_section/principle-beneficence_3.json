    "main_text": "The Place of Beneficence in the History of Ethical Theory || Mill\u2019s Theory\n2.2 Mill\u2019s Theory\n\n\nIn Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill argues that moral\nphilosophers have left a train of unconvincing and incompatible\ntheories that can be coherently unified by a single standard of\nbeneficence that allows us to decide objectively what is right and\nwrong. He declares the principle of utility, or the \u201cgreatest\nhappiness\u201d principle, to be the basic foundation of morals:\nActions are right in proportion to their promotion of happiness for all\nbeings, and wrong as they produce the reverse. This is a\nstraightforward principle of beneficence and potentially a very\ndemanding one. Mill and subsequent utilitarians mean that an action or\npractice is right (when compared with any alternative action or\npractice) if it leads to the greatest possible balance of\nbeneficial consequences (happiness for Mill) or to the least\npossible balance of bad consequences (unhappiness for Mill). Mill\nalso holds that the concepts of duty, obligation, and right are\nsubordinated to, and determined by, that which maximizes benefits and\nminimizes harmful outcomes. The principle of utility is presented by\nMill as an absolute principle, thereby making beneficence the one and\nonly supreme or preeminent principle of ethics. It justifies all\nsubordinate rules and is not simply one among a number of basic\nprinciples.\n\n\nMill\u2019s theory of morality is welfare-oriented at its core because\nmoral rightness is determined by goodness, which is itself to be\nunderstood in terms of the welfare of individuals. It is a\nconsequentialist theory because the moral rightness and obligatoriness\nof actions are established by their beneficial results. It is an\naggregative theory because a judgment about right or obligatory action\ndepends on an appraisal of the effects of different possible actions on\nthe welfare of all affected parties, which entails summing positive\nbenefits and negative effects over all persons affected. Beneficence\nhas rarely occupied such a central role in a moral theory.\n",
