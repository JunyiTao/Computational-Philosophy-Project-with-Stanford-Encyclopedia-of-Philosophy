    "main_text": "Anomalous Monism and Freedom || Anomalous Monism and Kant\u2019s Theory of Freedom\n3.2 Anomalous Monism and Contemporary Compatibilism.)\n6.1 Mental Properties and Explanatory Relevance\n\nCritics of this extensionalist line of defense insisted that related\nquestions remained about Anomalous Monism even taking into account the\ndistinction between causation and explanation. In particular, they\nquestioned whether mental properties could play any genuine\nexplanatory role\u2014whether they had explanatory\nrelevance\u2014given the priority assigned to physical\nproperties in Davidson\u2019s framework. Why think that mental\nproperties explain anything given that the events which instantiate\nthem always also instantiate physical properties that figure in causal\nlaws? One thought here is that genuine explanations require laws, and\nmental anomalism, in ruling out psychological and psychophysical laws,\ncannot account for any explanatory role for mental properties vis a\nvis physical or mental events.\n\nIn response, Davidson notes that while Anomalous Monism rejects the\npossibility of strict laws in which mental predicates can figure, it\nallows for ceteris paribus psychological and psychophysical\nlaws (Davidson 1993, 9\u201312). His point appears to be that if\nbacking by law is sufficient for explanatory relevance, then mental\nproperties are explanatorily relevant. (Davidson and his critics often\nslide between the issues of causal and explanatory relevance, but the\nlatter issue is clearly what is at stake given Davidson\u2019s views\nabout causal efficacy and properties.) Second, Davidson appeals to the\nsupervenience of mental properties on physical properties in order to\nground the explanatory role of mental properties. Davidson says\nthat\n\n\nproperties are causally efficacious if they make a difference to what\nindividual events cause, and supervenience ensures that\nmental properties do make a difference to what mental events cause.\n(Davidson 1993, 15)\n\n\nThe first point does not get developed by Davidson in any systematic\nway, though it has been explored by others interested in defending\nnonreductive monism from epiphenomenalist concerns. Some have focused\non exploiting ceteris paribus covering laws for\npsychophysical causal relations, claiming that this allows mental\nproperties to be sufficient for their effects, thus providing the\nneeded type of explanatory role (McLaughlin 1989; Fodor 1989, 1991).\nOthers have attempted to sidestep the issue of covering laws entirely\nby appealing directly to the truth of psychological and psychophysical\ncounterfactuals in grounding the explanatory role of mental properties\n(LePore and Loewer 1987, 1989; Horgan 1989). Davidson himself instead\nfocused on supervenience (although as we are about to see, the\npossibility of ceteris paribus laws enters into his\naccount).\n\nSupervenience implies that\n\n\nif two events differ in their psychological properties, they differ in\ntheir physical properties (which we assume to be causally\nefficacious). If supervenience holds, psychological properties make a\ndifference to the causal relations of an event, for they matter to the\nphysical properties, and the physical properties matter to causal\nrelations. (Davidson 1993, 14) \n\n\nThe point here is not simply that mental properties inherit or\npiggyback on the causal powers of the physical properties on which\nthey supervene. Rather, Davidson appears to be claiming that mental\nproperties influence the causal powers of their subvenient\nphysical properties.\n\nOne problem with Davidson\u2019s response here is its reversal of the\ndependency relationship between mental and physical properties\ntypically claimed in supervenience relationships. A central rationale\nfor positing supervenience is to mark a kind of explanatory primacy to\nthe subvenient properties (see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n And this is reflected in the first part of Davidson\u2019s\nformulation above\u2014surely a difference in psychological\nproperties entails (requires) a difference in physical properties\nbecause the difference in physical properties is needed in\norder to explain the difference in psychological properties.\nSo the sense in which psychological properties \u2018matter\u2019 to\nphysical properties is that changing the former amounts to a change in\nthe latter because a change in the latter explains a change\nin the former. This does not appear to be helpful in establishing the\nexplanatory relevance of mental properties. Another problem, discussed\nabove\n (5.3),\n is that it is difficult to see how a supervenience relation of\nsufficient power to make mental properties explanatory of an\nevent\u2019s physical properties in the way Davidson seems to suggest\ndoes not issue in strict laws. So it is unclear how supervenience is\nconsistent with the anomalism principle, and thus how it can help\nblock epiphenomenalist concerns, although we did previously note one\npotentially worthwhile but unexplored possibility\u2014a ceteris\nparibus supervenience relation\u2014which Davidson endorses.\n6.2 Interest-Relativity and the Dual Explananda Strategy\n\nKim has explored a related but different route from Anomalous Monism\nto mental epiphenomenalism\u2014the problem of explanatory exclusion\n(Kim 1989, 44). A causal explanation of an event cites a sufficient\ncondition for that event\u2019s occurrence. This seems to exclude the\npossibility of other independent causes or explanations of that event.\nSo if, as Anomalous Monism entails, physics can provide a sufficient\nexplanation of any particular event, there appears to be no room for\nan independent and irreducible mental explanation of an event\n(Davidson 1993, 15). It is because the cause instantiated some\nparticular physical property that the effect (which happens to\ninstantiate a mental property) came about. Any mental properties that\nthe cause instantiates seem superfluous in explaining why the effect\noccurred\u2014unless those properties are identical or related in\nsome strict lawlike way to the physical properties, something ruled\nout by the anomalism principle.\n\nDavidson responds by arguing that citing only the physical properties\nof the cause to provide a sufficient explanation of an action does not\naddress the particular interests that psychological explanations of\nactions serve\u2014providing the reasons of the agent in light of\nwhich she performed the action that she did. Serving these explanatory\ninterests compensates for the fact that such explanations cannot be\nsharpened into strict laws or folded neatly into physical laws\n(Davidson 1991, 163). We only understand why the agent waved her\nhand\u2014why the effect is of the mental kind \u2018waving\none\u2019s hand\u2019 (as opposed to merely \u2018one\u2019s hand\ngoing up and down\u2019)\u2014by citing mental properties\nof the causing event, such as her wanting to greet her friend. The\ncitation of physical properties of the causing event and the\nassociated mere bodily movement will not bring about such\nunderstanding, assuming mental anomalism, because of the lack of any\nreductive relationship between either the physical properties of the\ncause and the agent\u2019s reasons or the physical properties of the\neffect and the agent\u2019s action.\n\nHere we see the interest-relativity of explanation and its bearing on\nexplanatory relevance (see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance)\n playing an important role for Davidson. Mental properties must be\ncited if we want a rational explanation of mental\neffects. Davidson\u2019s response to epiphenomenalist concerns can\nthus be described as a kind of \u2018dual explananda\u2019\ntheory of the explanatory role of mental properties. According to this\ntheory, for every (causally interacting) mental event there are two\ndistinct explananda in need of explanation: an event of a\ncertain physical type and an event of a certain mental type. Mental\nproperties are accorded an ineliminable and (given Anomalous Monism)\nirreducible explanatory role by virtue of their singular capacity to\nmake intelligible the occurrence of other mental properties through\nthe sui generis relation of rationalization. This reflects\nthe point made at the end of\n 4.3\n by the causal definition interpretation of the argument for mental\nanomalism: that rationality underlies, not mental anomalism, but\nrather mental realism. (For related discussion of the dual\nexplananda approach, see Macdonalds 1995 and Gibbons\n2006.)\n\nIt should be noted, however, that it is not the case that\nonly mental properties can explain and be explained by the\noccurrence of mental properties. That would lead to an\n\u201coutlet\u201d problem, with mental properties being\nexplanatorily insulated from physical properties\u2014something\ninconsistent with the way in which we ordinarily think of\nmental-physical interaction. A blow to the head can, for instance,\nexplain the occurrence of a thought. And a thought can explain the\nmovement of an object, as when my decision to quench my thirst leads\nto the movement of a glass of water to my lips. However, the blow\ncannot rationalize the thought, and the decision cannot rationalize\nthe movement of the glass (though it can rationalize the\naction of moving the glass). Davidson\u2019s dual\nexplananda strategy provides no account of such phenomena\n(for discussion of the outlet problem, see Gibbons 2006). Nonetheless,\nso long as there are occurrences of mental properties in need of the\ndistinctive kind of explanation provided by rationalization, mental\nproperties occupy an ineliminable explanatory role. And given\nAnomalous Monism, that role is irreducible. It is worth noting that\nthis dual explananda strategy is consistent with\nDavidson\u2019s commitment to the causal closure of the physical\ndomain (Crane 1995 seems to miss this point)\u2014every physical\nevent can have a physical explanation, even if the mental component of\nsome physical events can be rationally explained only through appeal\nto mental components of the causing event. Therefore, however causal\nclosure ultimately enters into Anomalous Monism (see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical and Anomalous Monism),\n it does not appear to create any further problems for Anomalous\nMonism\u2019s ability to account for the ineliminable, irreducible\nexplanatory role of mental properties.\n\nThe interest-relativity of causal explanation is thus crucial in\nDavidson\u2019s grounding of the ineliminable explanatory role of\nmental properties within the framework of Anomalous Monism. If, as\nAnomalous Monism contends, mental event-types such as actions are not\nreducible to physical-event types, then the only way to explain\nactions (as opposed to mere bodily movements) so as to make them\nintelligible is by appeal to the mental properties of the\ncause\u2014reasons. (For discussion of whether, in light of this,\nreason explanations can still be maintained to be causal\nexplanations within the framework of Anomalous Monism, see the\nsupplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.)\n6.3 The Causal Constitution of Reasons\n\nA final point to consider in evaluating the epiphenomenalist\nobjections to Anomalous Monism is the way in which causality enters\ninto the constitution of reasons and reasons-explanations according to\nDavidson. Before we have established the anomalism principle, or go on\nto derive monism, we already know that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them (the \u2018because\u2019 problem discussed in\n 2.2).\n And, as we have seen\n (4.3),\n we know that propositional attitudes and mental contents are\nindividuated, and thus defined, partially in terms of what they are\ncaused by and cause (for attitudes, see Davidson 1987b, 41; for\ncontents, see Davidson 1987a, 444, and extended discussion in the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). But if something cannot\neven be recognized as a reason unless it is a cause, then the charge\nthat mental properties are causally impotent appears to have\ndifficulty getting any traction. And since these claims are prior to\nthe argument for monism, they are neutral about whatever else reasons\nmust be in order to be causes. So reasons must be recognized as causes\nprior to any discovery that they are also physical events. This\nappears to secure the causal potency of reasons in a way entirely\nindependent of the claim of token-identity. Within Davidson\u2019s\nframework, reasons can only play the rationalizing and explanatory\nrole that they do by virtue of their causal nature.\n\nMany of Anomalous Monism\u2019s epiphenomenalist critics do not\naddress this rich causal background. As we have seen, the background\nis not sufficient by itself to silence all epiphenomenalist concerns.\nBut it does significantly affect how those concerns can be formulated\nand addressed. Anomalous Monism is clearly deeply committed, at a\nnumber of levels, to the causal explanatory relevance of the mental,\nand so charity suggests that we try to understood it in a way such\nthat these commitments are respected. The dual explananda\nstrategy discussed above\n (6.2)\n provides one promising framework for doing this, while at the same\ntime displaying sensitivity to the sorts of concerns driving the\nepiphenomenalist objections.\n7. Conclusion\n\nDespite the initial appearance of simplicity in its assumptions,\nstructure and argumentation, we have turned up several important\nproblems and lacunae that stand in the way of any overall final\nassessment of the plausibility of Anomalous Monism. While the central\nobjections it has faced have derived from epiphenomenalist concerns,\nthe force of these objections is not clear. Arguably, the most serious\ndifficulties for Anomalous Monism are not with its adequacy but with\nits justification. We still stand in need of a clear argument for how\nrationality leads to the anomalism principle; there are the\nsubstantial problems surrounding the status of the causal closure of\nthe physical and its bearing on monism; and the cause-law\nprinciple\u2019s strictness requirement is still in need of a\ncompelling rationale. Even with these problems, Anomalous Monism\ncontinues to provide an extremely useful framework for exploring\nfundamental issues and problems in the philosophy of mind, and has\nearned a central place on the rather short list of important positions\non the relation between mental and physical events and properties.\n",
