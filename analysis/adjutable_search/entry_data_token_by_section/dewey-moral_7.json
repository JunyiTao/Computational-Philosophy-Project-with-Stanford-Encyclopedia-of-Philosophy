The first we may call the\nconstitutive function of value judgments. The point of appraisal, of\nmaking a value judgment, is to bring about the resumption of unified\nactivity, when the normal course of activity has been interrupted by a\nproblematic situation (TV 221\u20132). This situation incites\nhesitation and doubt about what to do. Dewey\u2019s point is that\nvalue judgments are essentially practical judgments. They aim to guide\naction, not just to passively describe things as they are. Making the\njudgment is the necessary means to deciding on a new course of action\nthat will solve the problem (LJP 14\u201316).\n\nSecond, the content of value judgments is about the value of actions\nand objects as means \u2014 that is, their value in relation\nto their consequences, or the consequences of valuing them in the\nsituation at hand. Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a\nparticular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences\nwould ensue, which would be valued (VEK 11). The difference between an\napparent and a real good, between an unreflectively and a reflectively\nvalued good, is captured by its value not just as immediately\nexperienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and\nhow they are valued. The ice cream seems good to the\nlactose-intolerant person; it is immediately prized by her. But it is\njudged to be not really good in view of the intolerable consequence of\nconsuming it. Value judgments place things in their wider context and\njudge them in relation to their consequences, more fully considered\n(TV 209\u2013213).\n\nThird, while the proximate and constitutive end of a value judgment is\nthe resumption of activity that has been interrupted by a problematic\nsituation, judgment has a remoter end, of using the action decided\nupon as a means for uncovering new evidence about what to value.\nIntelligently made value judgments are held provisionally and\nhypothetically, with an eye toward revising them if the consequences\nof acting on them are not found valuable. So viewed, value judgments\nare tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as\nscientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about\nthe world (VEK 19\u201326; VORC 88\u20139).\n",
