    "main_text": "Diverging and additional notions of connexivity\n1. Diverging and additional notions of connexivity\n\nThere are several further and some diverging notions of a connexive\nlogic. In particular, the second decade of the 21st century has\n(unfortunately) seen the introduction of confusingly many new notions\nof connexivity and non-uniform terminology. McCall (1966) introduced\nconnexive logics as systems ranging from logics in which no\nproposition implies or is implied by its own negation to logics in\nwhich BT is provable (together with non-symmetry of implication), and,\nsimilarly, Mares and Paoli (2019) characterize connexive logics as\nsystems having some or all of AT, AT\u2032, BT, and BT\u2032 among\ntheir theorems (without explicitly requiring non-symmetry of\nimplication). In McCall 2012, AT\u2032 and BT are said to be the\ndistinguishing marks of connexive logic, but note that AT and\nBT\u2032 are valid in the system CC1 due to Angell\n(1962) and MacCall (1966) as well. Logics in which some but not all of\nAT, AT\u2032, BT, and BT\u2032 are provable (or valid) are called\n\u2018demi-connexive\u2019 in Wansing, Omori, and Ferguson 2016\n(without explicitly requiring non-symmetry of implication), and are\nsaid to be quasi-connexive in Jarmu\u017cek and Malinowski\n2019a. The identification of the negation of (A \u2192\nB) with (A \u2192 ~B), ascribed to Boethius\nby Kneale and Kneale (1962), suggests a strengthening of BT and\nBT\u2032 to the equivalences:\n\n\nBTe: (A \u2192 B) \u2194 ~(A\n\u2192 ~B), and\n\nBTe\u2032: (A \u2192 ~B) \u2194 ~(A \u2192\nB).\n\n\nSylvan 1989 refers to BTe as a principle of hyperconnexive\nlogic. The principles BTe and BTe\u2032 are characteristic of the\nconnexive logics developed subsequent to the definition of the\nconnexive logic C and its quantified version\nQC in Wansing 2005. According to McCall (2012), the\nconverse of BT (the right-to-left direction of BTe) is highly\nunintuitive in light of what he takes to be counterexamples from\nEnglish. For a rejoinder see Wansing and Skurt 2018.\n\nKapsner (2012, 2019) refers to a logic that satisfies AT, AT\u2032,\nBT, and BT\u2032 and, moreover, satisfies the requirements\n\nUnsat1: In no model, A \u2192 ~A is satisfiable (for\nany A), and in no model, ~A \u2192 A is\nsatisfiable (for any A), and\n\nUnsat2: In no model, A \u2192 B and A\n\u2192 ~B are simultaneously satisfiable (for any A\nand B)\n\n\nas strongly connexive, whereas if the conditions Unsat1 and\nUnsat2 are not both satisfied, the system is only called weakly\nconnexive. Kapsner motivates the extra conditions by two\nintuitions, namely that it is not the case that a formula A\nshould imply or be implied by its own negation, and that if A\nimplies B, then A does not imply not-B (and\nif A implies not-B, then A does not imply\nB). These intuitions may, however, also be seen to motivate\n\u22ac ~A \u2192 A and \u22ac A \u2192 ~\nA, respectively (A \u2192B) \u22ac\n(A \u2192 ~B) and (A \u2192 ~B)\n\u22ac (A \u2192 B) instead of Unsat1 and Unsat2.\nMoreover, imposing Unsat1 and Unsat2 precludes systems that satisfy\nthe variable sharing property (i.e., broadly relevant or\nsociative logics in Routley\u2019s (1989) terminology, for\nwhich it holds that if A \u2192 B is a theorem, then\nA and B share at least one propositional variable)\nand satisfy the deduction theorem from being connexive. So far only\nfew strongly connexive logics satisfying the non-symmetry of\nimplication condition are known, namely the system\nCC1, which, however, \u201cis an awkward system in\nmany ways\u201d (McCall 2012, p. 429), see section 4.1, and the\nBoolean connexive relatedness logics from Jarmu\u017cek and Malinowski\n2019a, see section 4.4. In Wansing and Unterhuber 2019, logics that\nvalidate Boethius\u2019 theses only in rule form ((A \u2192\nB) \u22a2 ~(A \u2192 ~B) and (A\n\u2192 ~B) \u22a2 ~(A \u2192 B)) are\ncalled weakly connexive. Weiss (2019) considers a language\nwith classical negation, \u00ac, classical implication, \u2283, and\nanother binary conditional, \u2192, (notation adjusted). He calls a\nlogic half-connexive if it validates the Weak Boethius\u2019\nTheses:\n\nBTw: (A \u2192 B) \u2283 \u00ac(A \u2192\n\u00acB), and\n\nBTw\u2032: (A \u2192 \u00acB) \u2283 \u00ac(A\n\u2192 B),\n\n\nand refers to a logic as connexive if in addition it validates AT and\nAT\u2032 for \u2192 and \u00ac. The Weak Boethius\u2019 Thesis BTw\nwas introduced in Pizzi 1977 as \u201cconditional Boethius\u2019\nthesis\u201d for the connexive implication seen as standing for a\ncounterfactual conditional.\n\nIn Kapsner 2019, the demand of strong connexivity is evaluated as\n\u201ctoo stringent a requirement,\u201d and the notion of plain\nhumble connexivity is introduced by restricting Aristotle\u2019s\ntheses, Boethius\u2019 theses, Unsat1, and Unsat2 to satisfiable\nantecedents. A survey of the terminology and various notions of\nconnexivity used in the literature is presented in the\n Supplement on Terminology.\n It remains to be seen whether all the notions in addition to the\nestablished concept of connexive logic will turn out to be\nconducive.\n\nIf a language is used in which implication is not taken as primitive\nbut is defined in terms of other connectives, connexive logics could\nalso be seen as diverging from the orthodoxy of classical logic by\ngiving a deviant account of those connectives. A definition of a\nconnexive implication in terms of negation, conjunction, and necessity\ncan be found in McCall 1966 and Angell 1967b. More recently, Francez\n(2020) suggested the notion of \u201cpoly-connexivity\u201d to\nhighlight a modification of the familiar falsity conditions of\nconjunctions and disjunctions (in addition to adopting falsity\nconditions of implications as expressed by BTe\u2032).\n",
