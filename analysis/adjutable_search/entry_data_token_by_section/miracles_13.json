    "main_text": "Arguments from Miracles || Would miracles be evidence for the existence of God?\n4.2 How much would credible miracle reports establish?\n\n\nIn the final analysis, the relevance of background beliefs looms\nlarge. To say this is not to endorse a lazy and unprincipled\nrelativism; rather, the point is that one\u2019s considered rational\njudgment regarding the existence and nature of God must take into\naccount far more than the evidence for miracle claims. That is not to\nsay that they could not be an important or even, under certain\ncircumstances, a decisive piece of evidence; it is simply that neither\na positive nor a negative claim regarding the existence of God can be\nestablished on the basis of evidence for a miracle claim alone, without\nany consideration of other aspects of the question.\n\n\nFor the evidence for a miracle claim, being public and empirical, is\nnever strictly demonstrative, either as to the fact of the event or as\nto the supernatural cause of the event. It remains possible, though the\nfacts in the case may in principle render it wildly improbable, that\nthe testifier is either a deceiver or himself deceived; and so long as\nthose possibilities exist, there will be logical space for other forms\nof evidence to bear on the conclusion. Arguments about miracles\ntherefore take their place as one piece\u2014a fascinating\npiece\u2014in a larger and more important puzzle.\n\n",
