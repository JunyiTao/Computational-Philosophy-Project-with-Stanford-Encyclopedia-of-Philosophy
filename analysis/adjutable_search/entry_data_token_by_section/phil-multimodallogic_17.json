    "main_text": "Significant Interactions Between Modalities || Time and Knowledge\n4.2 Time and Knowledge\n\nTemporal-epistemic approaches have been briefly mentioned in this\ntext. Indeed, many logical systems have been used to describe the way\nin which the knowledge of agents changes over time. The proposals\ninclude not only interpreted systems (IS; Fagin et\nal. 1995) but also epistemic-temporal logic (ETL;\nParikh & Ramanujam 2003), logics of\n agency\n (e.g., see to it that logic,\n STIT;\n Belnap, Perloff, & Xu 2001) and the DEL approach\nmentioned before\n (section 2.8).\n In all of them, an important point of discussion is the interaction\nbetween the temporal and epistemic modalities.\n\nAs mentioned before, two famous requirements have been those of\nperfect recall (the agent\u2019s knowledge is not decreased\nover time) and no learning (the agent\u2019s knowledge is\nnot increased over time). In the simple fusion of epistemic logic and\nthe future fragment of tense logic described above, these two\nrequirements can be expressed, respectively, as  \n\\[\n    K\\varphi \\rightarrow GK\\varphi \\quad \\text{ and } \\quad FK\\varphi \\rightarrow K\\varphi.\n\\]\n\n\nFor some, the no learning condition might be too harsh, as it\nseems to say that the passage of time never helps to increase\nknowledge. A related but more reasonable condition is that of no\nmiracles, introduced in a slightly richer setting in van Benthem\nand Pacuit (2006), which states that the uncertainty of the agents\ncannot be erased by the same\n event.[15]\n A further interaction property is that of synchronicity,\nwhich states that epistemic uncertainty only happens among epistemic\nsituations that occur at the same moment of time. For example, the\nagent always knows \u2018what time it is\u2019, as she might not\nknow which action was executed, but she always knows that some action\nhas taken place.\n\nFor more information on the interaction of time and knowledge, the\nreader is referred, among others, to Halpern, van der Meyden, and\nVardi (2004); van Benthem, Gerbrandy, et al. (2009). See also van\nBenthem and D\u00e9gremont (2010) and D\u00e9gremont (2010) for\nanalogous interactions between time and beliefs, with the\nlatter represented by plausibility preorders similar to the\nplausibility models described before.\n",
