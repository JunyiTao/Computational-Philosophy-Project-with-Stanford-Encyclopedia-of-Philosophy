    "main_text": "The firm in society || Corporate political activity\n7.2 Corporate political activity\n\nMany businesses are active participants in the political arena. They\nsupport candidates for election, defend positions in public debate,\nlobby government officials, and more. What should be said about these\nactivities?\n\nSocial scientists have produced a substantial literature on corporate\npolitical activity (CPA) (for a review, see Lawton, McGuire, &\nRajwani 2013). This research focuses on such questions as: What forms\ndoes CPA take? What are the antecedents of CPA? What are its\nconsequences? CPA raises many normative questions as well.\n\nWe might begin by asking why corporations should be allowed to engage\nin political activity at all. In a democratic society, freedom of\nexpression is both a right and a value (Stark 2010). People have a\nright to participate in the political process by supporting candidates\nfor public office, defending positions in public debate, and so on. It\nis generally a good thing when they exercise this right, since they\ncan introduce new facts and arguments into public discourse. People\ncan engage in political activity individually, but in a large society,\nthey may find it useful to do so in groups. The firm might be seen as\none of these groups. Indeed, we might think it is especially important\nthat firms engage in (at least some forms of) political activity.\nSociety has an interest in knowing how proposed economic policies will\naffect firms; firms themselves are a good source of information.\n\nBut political activity by corporations has come in for criticism. One\nconcern focuses on what corporations\u2019 goals are. Some worry that\nfirms engage in CPA in order to advance their own interests at the\nexpense of their competitors\u2019 or the public\u2019s. This\nactivity is sometimes described, and condemned, as\n\u201crent-seeking\u201d (Jaworski 2014; Tullock 1989). Questions\nhave been raised about the nature and value of rent-seeking. According\nto a common definition, rent-seeking is socially wasteful economic\nactivity intended to secure benefits from the state rather than the\nmarket. But there is disagreement about what counts as waste. Lobbying\nfor subsidies, or tariffs on foreign competitors, are classic cases of\nrent-seeking. But subsidies for (e.g.) corn might help to secure a\nnation\u2019s food supply, and tariffs on (e.g.) foreign steel\nmanufacturers might help a nation to protect itself in a time of war\n(Boatright 2009; Hindmoor 1999). One person\u2019s private\nrent-seeking is another\u2019s public benefit.\n\nA second concern about CPA is that it can undermine the ideal of\nequality at the heart of democracy (Christiano 2010). Some\ncorporations have a lot of money, and this can be translated into a\nlot of power. In 2010, the state of Indiana passed a law\u2014the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)\u2014that appeared to give\nemployers the freedom to discriminate against LGBTQ people on\nreligious grounds. In response, Salesforce and Angie\u2019s List\ncancelled plans to expand in the state, and threatened to leave it\naltogether. Indiana quickly convened a special session of its\nlegislature and announced that the new law did not in fact give\nemployers this freedom. By contrast, if the average Indianan told the\nlegislature that they might leave the state because of the RFRA, the\nlegislature would not have cared. This objection to CPA is also an\nobjection to political activity by powerful groups like the National\nRifle Association (NRA) or the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)\nand individuals like Charles Koch or Tom Steyer.\n\nA third objection to CPA is more narrowly targeted. According to it,\ncorporations are not the right type of entities to engage in political\nactivity (Hussain & Moriarty 2018). The key issue is\nrepresentation. Organizations like the NRA and ACLU are legitimate\nparticipants in the political arena because they represent their\nmembers in political debate, and people join or leave them based on\npolitical considerations. By contrast, business organizations have no\nrecognized role to play in the political system, and people join or\nleave them for economic reasons, not political ones. On this\ncriticism, corporate political activity should be conceptualized not\nas a collective effort by all of the corporation\u2019s members to\nspeak their minds about a shared concern, but as an effort by a small\ngroup of powerful owners or executives to use the corporation\u2019s\nresources to advance their own personal ends.\n\nTraditionally CPA goes \u201cthrough\u201d the formal political\nprocess, e.g., contributing to political campaigns or lobbying\ngovernment officials. But increasingly firms are engaging in what\nappears to be political activity that goes \u201caround\u201d or\n\u201coutside\u201d of this process, especially in circumstances in\nwhich the state is weak, corrupt, or incompetent. They do this through\nthe provision of public goods and infrastructure (Ruggie 2004) and the\ncreation of systems of private regulation or \u201csoft law\u201d\n(Vogel 2010). For example, when the Rana Plaza collapsed in Bangladesh\nin 2013, killing more than 1100 garment industry workers, new building\ncodes and systems of enforcement were put into place. But they were\nput into place by the multinational corporations that are supplied by\nfactories in Bangladesh, not by the government of Bangladesh. This\nkind of activity is sometimes called \u201cpolitical CSR,\u201d\nsince it is a kind of CSR that produces a political outcome (Scherer\n& Palazzo 2011). We might call it CPA \u201con steroids\u201d.\nInstead of influencing political outcomes, corporations bring them\nabout almost single-handedly. This is a threat to democratic\nself-rule. Some writers have explored whether it can be ameliorated\nthrough multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs), or governance systems\nthat bring together firms, non-governmental organizations, and members\nof local communities to deliberate and decide on policy matters.\nProminent examples include the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the\nRoundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), and the Extractive\nIndustries Transparency Initiative (EITI) (Scherer & Palazzo\n2011). Critics have charged that MSIs, while effective in producing\ndialog among stakeholders, are ineffective at holding firms to account\n(Hussain & Moriarty 2018; Moog, Spicer, & B\u00f6hm 2015).\n\nThere is another kind of corporate political activity. This is\npolitical activity whose target is corporations, known as\n\u201cethical consumerism\u201d (for a review see Schwartz 2017).\nConsumers typically make choices based on quality and price. Ethical\nconsumers (also) appeal to moral considerations. They may purchase, or\nchoose not to purchase, goods from retailers who make their products\nin certain countries or who support certain political causes. These\ncan be described as political activities because consumers are using\ntheir economic power to achieve political ends. It is difficult for\nconsumer actions against, or in support of, firms to succeed, since\nthey require coordinating the actions of many individuals. But\nconsuming ethically may be important for personal integrity. You might\nsay that you cannot in good conscience shop at a retailer who is\nworking, in another arena, against your deeply-held values. One\nconcern about ethical consumerism is that it may be a form of\nvigilantism (Hussain 2012; cf. Barry & MacDonald 2018), or mob\njustice. Another is that it is yet another way that people can\nself-segregate by moral and political orientation as opposed to\nfinding common ground.\n",
