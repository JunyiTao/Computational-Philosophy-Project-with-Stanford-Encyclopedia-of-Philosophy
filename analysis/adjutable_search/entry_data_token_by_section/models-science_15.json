Models and Other Debates in the Philosophy of Science\n\nThe debate over scientific models has important repercussions for\nother issues in the philosophy of science (for a historical account of\nthe philosophical discussion about models, see Bailer-Jones 1999).\nTraditionally, the debates over, say, scientific realism, reductionism,\nand laws of nature were couched in terms of theories, because theories\nwere seen as the main carriers of scientific knowledge. Once models\nare acknowledged as occupying an important place in the edifice of\nscience, these issues have to be reconsidered with a focus on models.\nThe question is whether, and if so how, discussions of these issues\nchange when we shift focus from theories to models. Up to now, no\ncomprehensive model-based account of any of these issues has emerged,\nbut models have left important traces in the discussions of these\ntopics.\n",
