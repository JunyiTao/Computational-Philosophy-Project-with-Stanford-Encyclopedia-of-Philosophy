Suppose we ask whether one can conservatively add\nto intuitionistic logic three binary connectives #1,\n#2, #3, satisfying for all \u03c6, \u03c8:\n\n\n\n \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #1 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8) \n \u00a0and\u00a0 \n \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #2 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8).  \n\n\n\nIn classical logic we can take \u03c6 #1 \u03c8 and \u03c6\n#2 \u03c8 as (equivalent to) \u00ac\u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c8\nrespectively, and \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as \u22a5. There are no\nthree candidates playing the desired role in any conservative\nextension of intuitionistic logic, however, because the inset\nequivalences render arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 head-linked in the sense\nof Section\n 3,\n with \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as the head formula.\n",
