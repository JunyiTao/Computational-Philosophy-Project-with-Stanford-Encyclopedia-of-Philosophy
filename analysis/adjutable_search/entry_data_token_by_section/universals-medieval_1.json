    "main_text": "The Emergence of the Problem\n2. The Emergence of the Problem\n\nIt is easy to see how the problem of universals emerges, if we\nconsider a geometrical demonstration, for example, the demonstration\nof Thales\u2019 theorem. According to the theorem, any triangle\ninscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle, as is shown in the\nfollowing diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Thales\u2019 theorem\n\n\nLooking at this diagram, we can see that all we need to prove is that\nthe angle at vertex D of triangle ABD is a right angle. The proof is\neasy once we realize that since lines AC, DC, and BC are the radii of\na circle, the triangles ACD and DCB are isosceles triangles, whence\ntheir base angles are equal. For then, if we denote the angles of ABD\nby the names of their vertices, this fact entails that D=A + B; and\nso, since A + B + D=180o, it follows that 2A +\n2B=180o; therefore, A + B=90o, that is,\nD=90o, q. e. d.\n\nOf course, from our point of view, the important thing about this\ndemonstration is not so much the truth of its conclusion as\nthe way it proves this conclusion. For the conclusion is a\nuniversal theorem, which has to concern all possible triangles\ninscribed in any possible semicircle whatsoever, not just the one\ninscribed in the semicircle in the figure above. Yet, apparently, in\nthe demonstration above we were talking only about that triangle. So,\nhow can we claim that whatever we managed to prove concerning that\nparticular triangle will hold for all possible triangles?\n\nIf we take a closer look at the diagram, we can easily see the appeal\nof the Platonic answer to this question. For upon a closer look, it is\nclear that, despite appearances to the contrary, this demonstration\ncannot be about the triangle in this diagram. Indeed, in the\ndemonstration we assumed that the lines AC, DC, and BC were all\nperfectly equal, straight lines. However, if we zoom in on the figure,\nwe can clearly see that these lines are far from being equal; in fact,\nthey are not even straight lines:\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The result of zooming in on\nFigure 1.\n\n\nThe demonstration was certainly not about the collection of jagged\nblack surfaces that we can see here. Rather, the demonstration\nconcerned something we did not see with our bodily eyes, but what we\nhad in mind all along, understanding it to be a triangle, with\nperfectly straight edges, touching a perfect circle in three\nunextended points, which are all perfectly equidistant from the center\nof the circle. The figure we could see was only a convenient\n\u201creminder\u201d of what we are supposed to have in mind when we\nwant to prove that a certain property, namely, that it is a right\ntriangle, has to belong to the object in our mind in virtue of what it\nis, namely, a triangle inscribed in a semicircle. Obviously, the\nconclusion applies perfectly only to the perfect triangle we had in\nmind, whereas it holds for the visible figure only insofar as, and to\nthe extent that, this figure resembles the object we had in mind. But\nthis figure fails to have this property precisely insofar as, and to\nthe extent that, it falls short of the object in our mind.\n\nHowever, on the basis of this point it should also be clear that the\nconclusion does apply to this figure, and every other visible\ntriangle inscribed in a semicircle as well, insofar as, and to the\nextent that, it manages to imitate the properties of the perfect\nobject in our mind. Therefore, the Platonic answer to the question of\nwhat this demonstration was about, namely, that it was about a\nperfect, ideal triangle, which is invisible to the eyes, but is\ngraspable by our understanding, at once provides us with an\nexplanation of the possibility of universal, necessary knowledge. By\nknowing the properties of the Form or Idea, we know all its\nparticulars, i.e., all the things that imitate it, insofar as they\nimitate or participate in it. So, the Form itself is a universal\nentity, a universal model of all its particulars; and since it is the\nknowledge of this universal entity that can enable us to know at once\nall its particulars, it is absolutely vital for us to know\nwhat it is, what it is like, and exactly\nhow it is related to its particulars. However,\nobviously, all these questions presuppose that it is\nat all, namely, that such a universal entity exists.\n\nBut the existence of such an entity seems to be rather precarious.\nConsider, for instance, the perfect triangle we were supposed to have\nin mind during the demonstration of Thales\u2019 theorem. If it is a\nperfect triangle, it obviously has to have three sides, since a\nperfect triangle has to be a triangle, and nothing can be a triangle\nunless it has three sides. But of those three sides either at least\ntwo are equal or none, that is to say, the triangle in question has to\nbe either isosceles or scalene (taking \u2018isosceles\u2019\nbroadly, including even equilateral triangles, for the sake of\nsimplicity). However, since it is supposed to be the universal model\nof all triangles, and not only of isosceles triangles, this\nperfect triangle cannot be an isosceles, and for the same reason it\ncannot be a scalene triangle either. Therefore, such a universal\ntriangle would have to have inconsistent properties, namely,\nboth that it is either isosceles or scalene and that\nit is neither isosceles nor scalene. However, obviously nothing can\nhave these properties at the same time, so nothing can be a universal\ntriangle any more than a round square. So, apparently, no universal\ntriangle can exist. But then, what was our demonstration about? Just a\nlittle while ago, we concluded that it could not be directly about any\nparticular triangle (for it was not about the triangle in the figure,\nand it was even less about any other particular triangle not in the\nfigure), and now we had to conclude that it could not be about a\nuniversal triangle either. But are there any further alternatives? It\nseems obvious that through this demonstration we do gain universal\nknowledge concerning all particulars. Yet it is also clear that we do\nnot, indeed, we cannot gain this knowledge by examining all\nparticulars, both because they are potentially infinite and because\nnone of them perfectly satisfies the conditions stated in the\ndemonstration. So, there must have been something wrong in our\ncharacterization of the universal, which compelled us to conclude\nthat, in accordance with that characterization, universals could not\nexist. Therefore, we are left with a whole bundle of questions\nconcerning the nature and characteristics of universals, questions\nthat cannot be left unanswered if we want to know how universal,\nnecessary knowledge is possible, if at all.\n",
