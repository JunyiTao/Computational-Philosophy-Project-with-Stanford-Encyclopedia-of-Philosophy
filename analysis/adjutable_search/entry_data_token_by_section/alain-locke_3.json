    "main_text": "Axiology/Value Theory || Transvaluation\n2.3 Transvaluation\n\nTransvaluation is a central tenet of Locke's axiology. He writes:\n\n[t]he further we investigate, the more we discover that there is no\nfixity of content to values, and the more we are bound, then, to infer\nthat their identity as groups must rest on other elements. (VI 40)\n\n\nThe feeling-quality of a given value necessarily establishes the mode\nof valuation, i.e., the type of value in question (for example,\naesthetic, religious, moral etc.) as well as the appropriate\nvalue-predicates. However, there is no necessary connection between a\ngiven object that serves as the content of a value and any particular\nemotional response to that object. One and the same object may affect\nthe same person differently at different times, or may at the same\ntime elicit from multiple people different emotional reactions.\nTransvaluation, then is most simply valuing something in a different\nway, which requires, at first, having an atypical emotional\nassociation with the object of value. There are multifarious potential\ncauses of such transformations in one's affective responses to an\nobject, and those causes can be immediate or unfold over time.\n\u201cThe changed feeling-attitude creates a new value\u201d says\nLocke \u201cand the type-form of the attitude brings with it its\nappropriate value category. These modes co-assert their own relevant\nnorms; each sets up a categorical imperative of its own\u201d (VI\n41).\n\nLocke treats transvaluation as inevitable; values are dependent upon\nsocial and cultural forces that are always in a state of flux and\nsubject to myriad transformative influences at any given time, hence\nstatic values are implausible. Value transformation can take place on\nthe individual level or on the level of widespread social or cultural\nvalues. Locke's hope is that this analysis will bring us closer to a\npractical understanding of value and the mechanism of valuation, which\nhe hopes will bring us closer to understanding the grounds for both\nagreements among values and value conflict.\n",
