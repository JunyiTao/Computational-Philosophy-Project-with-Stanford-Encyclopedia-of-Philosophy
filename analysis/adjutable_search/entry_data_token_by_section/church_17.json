    "main_text": "Paradox || Comparing Russell and Tarski\n4.3 Comparing Russell and Tarski\n\nIn an important paper but one still not widely discussed in print,\n\u201cA Comparison of Russell\u2019s Resolution of the Semantical\nAntinomies with that of Tarski\u201d (1976), reprinted with some\nadditions and corrections in Martin (1984) and The Collected\nWorks (2019), Church does the following:\n\nHe gives an elegant formulation of RTT as a straightforward\ncomplication of STT. (See\n supplement D.\n We adopt the definitions and notations used there.)\nHe shows how Grelling\u2019s paradox, GP, may be derived within\nSTT with the addition of a semantical predicate Val in the object\nlanguage interpreting \u201cforms\u201d (wffs containing free\nvariables) and governed by appropriate postulates.\nHe shows how RTT resolves GP and how it answers the question\nwhether \u201cheterological\u201d is heterological or not. Depending\non its level, it sometimes is and sometimes is not; but the assignment\nof levels is not ad hoc. It emerges as a product of RTT along\nwith the axioms about Val.\nHe defines languages \\(L_1,\\) \\(L_2,\\)\u2026, \\(L_{n +\n1},\\)\u2026, \\(L_w = L,\\) in terms of the r-types and Val,\nwhere \\(L_{n + 1}\\) is a semantical metalanguage for \\(L_n\\).\nHe shows how analogues of Tarski\u2019s definitions of\nsatisfaction and truth and Tarski\u2019s theorem are obtained for the\nlanguages \\(L_n\\) and concludes that Russell\u2019s resolution of GP\nis a special case of Tarski\u2019s.\nHe formulates the axioms of reducibility which are needed to\nrestore the impredicative definitions required for classical\nmathematics. He then shows that reducibility does not, at least not in\nany obvious way, reinstate GP. However, the system with Val and\nreducibility does prove certain results about definability and\nnameability of propositional functions.\n\n",
