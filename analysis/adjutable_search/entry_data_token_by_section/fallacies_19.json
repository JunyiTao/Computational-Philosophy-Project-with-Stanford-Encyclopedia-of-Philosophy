    "main_text": "Current issues in fallacy theory || Teaching\n4.4 Biases\n\nRecently there has been renewed interest in how biases are related to\nfallacies. Correia (2011) has taken Mill\u2019s insight that biases\nare predisposing causes of fallacies a step further by connecting\nidentifiable biases with particular fallacies. Biases can influence\nthe unintentional committing of fallacies even where there is no\nintent to be deceptive, he observes. Taking biases to be\n\u201csystematic errors that invariably distort the subject\u2019s\nreasoning and judgment,\u201d the picture drawn is that particular\nbiases are activated by desires and emotions (motivated reasoning) and\nonce they are in play, they negatively affect the fair evaluation of\nevidence. Thus, for example, the \u201cfocussing illusion\u201d bias\ninclines a person to focus on just a part of the evidence available,\nignoring or denying evidence that might lead in another direction.\nCorreia (2011, 118) links this bias to the fallacies of hasty\ngeneralization and straw man, suggesting that it is our desire to be\nright that activates the bias to focus more on positive or negative\nevidence, as the case may be. Other biases he links to other\nfallacies.\n\nThagard (2011) is more concerned to stress the differences between\nfallacies and biases than to find connections between them. He claims\nthat the model of reasoning articulated by informal logic is not a\ngood fit with the way that people actually reason and that only a few\nof the fallacies are relevant to the kinds of mistakes people actually\nmake. Thagard\u2019s argument depends on his distinction between\nargument and inference. Arguments, and fallacies, he takes to be\nserial and linguistic, but inferences are brain activities and are\ncharacterized as parallel and multi-modal. By \u201cparallel\u201d\nis meant that the brain carries out different processes\nsimultaneously, and by \u201cmulti-modal\u201d that the brain uses\nnon-linguistic and emotional, as well as linguistic representations in\ninferring. Biases (inferential error tendencies) can unconsciously\naffect inferring. \u201cMotivated inference,\u201d for example,\n\u201cinvolves selective recruitment and assessment of evidence based\non unconscious processes that are driven by emotional considerations\nof goals rather than purely cognitive reasoning\u201d (2011, 156).\nThagard volunteers a list of more than fifty of these inferential\nerror tendencies. Because motivated inferences result from unconscious\nmental processes rather than explicit reasoning, the errors in\ninferences cannot be exposed simply by identifying a fallacy in a\nreconstructed argument. Dealing with biases requires identification of\nboth conscious and unconscious goals of arguers, goals that can figure\nin explanations of why they incline to particular biases.\n\u201cOvercoming people\u2019s motivated inferences,\u201d Thagard\nconcludes, \u201cis therefore more akin to psychotherapy than\ninformal logic\u201d (157), and the importance of fallacies is\naccordingly marginalized.\n\nIn response to these findings, one can admit their relevance to the\npedagogy of critical thinking but still recall the distinction between\nwhat causes mistakes and what the mistakes are. The analysis of\nfallacies belongs to the normative study of arguments and\nargumentation, and to give an account of what the fallacy in a given\nargument is will involve making reference to some norm of\nargumentation. It will be an explanation of what the mistake in the\nargument is. Biases are relevant to understanding why people commit\nfallacies, and how we are to help them get past them, but they do not\nhelp us understand what the fallacy-mistakes are in the first\nplace\u2014this is not a question of psychology. Continued research\nat this intersection of interests will hopefully shed more light on\nboth biases and fallacies.\n",
