    "main_text": "Outstanding Issues || The Problem of Partiality\n3.4 Circularity\n\nAs noted in the introduction to this entry, some FA theorists identify\nwhat\u2019s valuable simpliciter with what\u2019s\ndesirable, and explain facts about what\u2019s desirable in terms of\nfacts about what\u2019s fitting to desire. Other FA theorists,\nhowever, reject that the valuable can be identified with the\ndesirable, often on the grounds that some valuable things seem not to\ncall for desire but for other pro-responses (Ewing 1939; Anderson\n1993; Scanlon 1998). For example, we might think that persons have a\nparticular kind of value that calls fundamentally for responses like\nrespect and preservation, and indeed that desire\nisn\u2019t the proper response to the special value of persons at\nall. And more generally, FA theorists might hold that the pro-response\ncalled for by a valuable thing can vary according to the kind of thing\nat issue. For example, as Scanlon (1998) suggests, the pro-response\ncalled for by a valuable friendship might differ from that called for\nby a valuable piece of music. Hence, Scanlon (and others) opt to\nexplain facts about value in terms of normative facts about\nvaluing, where valuing can consist variously in a range of\npro-responses.\n\nBut such FA theories face a challenge. As Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2004) put it, the challenge is to specify\n\u201cthe common denominator for all the responses in the\n\u2018pro\u2019-category\u201d, to tell us \u201cwhat makes them\n\u2018pro\u2019\u201d (401). What makes respect and reverence, for\nexample, positive responses (as opposed to negative ones)? And why is\nprotecting something a pro-response to it while pondering it is not? A\npossible and extensionally plausible answer would be to define\npositive responses as responses that are called for by valuable things\n(and negative responses as responses that are called for by\ndisvaluable things), but this makes FA theories circular. The\nchallenge is for FA theorists to specify what makes pro-attitudes\n\u201cpro\u201d without circularity.\n\nAn early version of this challenge was pressed by W.D. Ross (1939), as\na criticism of Ewing\u2019s (1939) FA theory of value\nsimpliciter. Ross suggests that Ewing\u2019s account of\nvalue in terms of fitting positive emotional responses is circular\nbecause the positive emotional responses he appeals to are always\naccompanied by the thought that the object of the response is somehow\n\u201cgood\u201d. Since positive emotional responses to a thing\ninvolve taking the thing to be good, the goodness of a thing\ncan\u2019t be non-circularly explained by appeal to (fitting)\npositive emotional responses. Ewing\u2019s (1947) response was to\ninsist that positive emotional responses aren\u2019t necessarily\naccompanied by the thought their object is good. Instead, a positive\nemotional response need only be accompanied by thoughts about its\nobject\u2019s non-evaluative, good-making characteristics.\nHence, positive emotional responses needn\u2019t involve the thought\nthat their objects are good.\n\nThe success of Ewing\u2019s reply to Ross continues to be a matter of\ndebate (Hurka 2014, ch. 2). In any case, Ewing\u2019s reply\ndoesn\u2019t offer a positive account of what makes pro-responses\n\u201cpro\u201d; it merely rejects a possible answer to that\nquestion that would make FA theories circular. Another possible\nresponse to the challenge is to embrace circularity. According to\nsome, even if we can\u2019t adequately characterize pro-responses\nwithout reference to the kind of value that FA theories seek to\nexplain, FA theories can nonetheless remain illuminating and\ninformative (see esp. Wiggins 1987 and Tappolet 2011). In short, we\ncan concede the circularity, but claim it\u2019s not vicious. This\nresponse pairs well with the \u201cno-priority view\u201d discussed\nin section 2.1, but seems contrary to FA theories of value, insofar as\ntheir explanatory element is essential to them.\n\nA third response is to concede the purported circularity of certain FA\ntheories of value simpliciter, to reject such theories in\nlight of that circularity, but to embrace FA theories of more specific\nevaluative properties, which, on the face of it, seem less vulnerable\nto circularity worries. According to this response, the right response\nto the present challenge isn\u2019t to abandon FA theory tout\ncourt, but to be more selective about which FA theories we\naccept. For example, we might reject an FA theory of value\nsimpliciter on grounds of circularity, but accept FA theories\nof being delicious, trustworthy, admirable, despicable, lovable,\ndelightful, and so on. Of course, proponents of even this more limited\napproach may still ultimately need to characterize the responses in\nterms of which they seek to explain these evaluative properties\nwithout referring to those properties, but, according to some, the\nprospects for doing so seem at least comparatively promising (Gibbard\n1990; D\u2019Arms and Jacobson 2000b; Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004; Jacobson 2011; Rosen 2015a).\n\nA fourth and final response, of course, would be to try to tackle the\ncircularity challenge head on by offering a plausible account of what\nmakes pro-responses \u201cpro\u201d that doesn\u2019t refer to the\nnotion of value simpliciter. Perhaps, for example, what makes\npro-responses \u201cpro\u201d is some common descriptive\nmotivational element (Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2004). Or\nperhaps there\u2019s some common normative element to all\npro-responses that FA theorists could non-circularly appeal to. At the\ntime of writing, however, this issue is underexplored, and the task of\ndeveloping this kind of response remains outstanding.\n",
