    "main_text": "Functionalism and Qualia\n4. Functionalism and Qualia\n\nFunctionalism is the view that individual qualia have functional\nnatures, that the phenomenal character of, e.g., pain is one and the\nsame as the property of playing such-and-such a causal or\nteleofunctional role in mediating between physical inputs (e.g., body\ndamage) and physical outputs (e.g., withdrawal behavior). On this view\n(Lycan 1987), qualia are multiply physically realizable. Inner states\nthat are physically very different may nonetheless feel the same. What\nis crucial to what it is like is functional role, not underlying\nhardware. \n\nThere are two famous objections to functionalist theories of qualia:\nthe Inverted Spectrum and the Absent Qualia Hypothesis. The first move\nin the former objection consists in claiming that you might see red\nwhen I see green and vice-versa; likewise for the other colors so that\nour color experiences are phenomenally inverted. This does not suffice\nto create trouble for the functionalist yet. For you and I are surely\nrepresentationally different here: for example, you have a visual\nexperience that represents red when I have one that represents green.\nAnd that representational difference brings with it a difference in\nour patterns of causal interactions with external things (and thereby\na functional difference).\n\nThis reply can be handled by the advocate of inverted qualia by\nswitching to a case in which we both have visual experiences with the\nsame representational contents on the same occasions while still\ndiffering phenomenally. Whether such cases are really metaphysically\npossible is open to dispute, however. Certainly, those philosophers\nwho are representationalists about qualia (see Section 7) would deny\ntheir possibility. Indeed, it is not even clear that such cases are\nconceptually possible (Harrison 1973, Hardin 1993, Tye 1995). But\nleaving this to one side, it is far from obvious that there would not\nhave to be some salient fine-grained functional differences between\nus, notwithstanding our gross functional identity.\n\nConsider a computational example. For any two numerical inputs,\nM and N, a given computer always produces as outputs\nthe product of M and N. There is a second computer\nthat does exactly the same thing. In this way, they are functionally\nidentical. Does it follow that they are running exactly the same\nprogram? Of course, not! There are all sorts of programs that will\nmultiply together two numbers. These programs can differ dramatically.\nAt one gross level the machines are functionally identical, but at\nlower levels the machines can be functionally different.\n\nIn the case of you and me, then, the opponent of inverted qualia can\nclaim that, even if we are functionally identical at a coarse level\n\u2014 we both call red things \u2018red\u2019, we both believe\nthat those things are red on the basis of our experiences, we both are\ncaused to undergo such experiences by viewing red things, etc. \u2014\nthere are necessarily fine-grained differences in our internal\nfunctional organization. And that is why our experiences are\nphenomenally different.\n\nSome philosophers will no doubt respond that it is still imaginable\nthat you and I are functionally identical in all relevant\nrespects yet phenomenally different. But this claim presents a problem\nat least for those philosophers who oppose functionalism but who\naccept physicalism. For it is just as easy to imagine that there are\ninverted qualia in molecule-by-molecule duplicates (in the same\nexternal, physical settings) as it is to imagine inverted qualia in\nfunctional duplicates. If the former duplicates are really\nmetaphysically impossible, as the physicalist is committed to\nclaiming, why not the latter? Some further convincing argument needs\nto be given that the two cases are disanalogous. As yet, to my mind,\nno such argument has been presented. (Of course, this response does\nnot apply to those philosophers who take the view that qualia are\nirreducible, non-physical entities. However, these philosophers have\nother severe problems of their own. In particular, they face the\nproblem of phenomenal causation. Given the causal closure of the\nphysical, how can qualia make any difference? For more here, see Tye\n1995, Chalmers 1996).\n\nThe absent qualia hypothesis is the hypothesis that functional\nduplicates of sentient creatures are possible, duplicates that\nentirely lack qualia. For example, one writer (Block 1980) asks us to\nsuppose that a billion Chinese people are each given a two-way radio\nwith which to communicate with one another and with an artificial\n(brainless) body. The movements of the body are controlled by the\nradio signals, and the signals themselves are made in accordance with\ninstructions the Chinese people receive from a vast display in the sky\nwhich is visible to all of them. The instructions are such that the\nparticipating Chinese people function like individual neurons, and the\nradio links like synapses, so that together the Chinese people\nduplicate the causal organization of a human brain. Whether or not\nthis system, if it were ever actualized, would actually\nundergo any feelings and experiences, it seems coherent to suppose\nthat it might not. But if this is a real metaphysical possibility,\nthen qualia do not have functional essences.\n\nOne standard functionalist reply to cases like the China-body system\nis to bite the bullet and to argue that however strange it seems, the\nChina-body system could not fail to undergo qualia. The oddness of\nthis view derives, according to some functionalists (Lycan 1987), from\nour relative size. We are each so much smaller than the China-body\nsystem that we fail to see the forest for the trees. Just as a\ncreature the size of a neuron trapped inside a human head might well\nbe wrongly convinced that there could not be consciousness there, so\nwe too draw the wrong conclusion as we contemplate the China-body\nsystem. It has also been argued (e.g., by Shoemaker 1975) that any\nsystem that was a full functional duplicate of one of us would have to\nbe subject to all the same beliefs, including beliefs about its own\ninternal states. Thus the China-Body system would have to believe that\nit experiences pain; and if it had beliefs of this sort, then it could\nnot fail to be the subject of some experiences (and hence some states\nwith phenomenal character). If this reply is successful (for an\nupdated version of this reply and a new related thought experiment,\nsee Tye 2006), what it shows is that the property of having some\nphenomenal character or other has a functional essence. But it does\nnot show that individual qualia are functional in nature. Thus one\ncould accept that absent qualia are impossible while also holding that\ninverted spectra are possible (see, e.g., Shoemaker 1975).\n",
