For one\nthing, we could use revision-theoretic notions to make rather\nfine-grained distinctions among sentences: Some sentences are unstable\nin every revision sequence; others are stable in every revision\nsequence, though stably true in some and stably false in others; and\nso on. Thus, we can use revision-theoretic ideas to give a\nfine-grained analysis of the status of various sentences, and of the\nrelationships of various sentences to one another. Hsiung (2017)\nexplores further this possibility by generalizing the notion of a\nrevision sequence to a revision mapping on a digraph, in\norder to extend this analysis to sets of sentences of a\ncertain kind, called Boolean paradoxes. As shown in Hsiung\n2022 this procedure can also be reversed, at least to some extent: Not\nonly we can use revision sequences (or mappings) to classify\nparadoxical sentences by means of their revision-theoretic patterns,\nbut we can also construct \u201cnew\u201d paradoxes from given\nrevision-theoretic patterns. Rossi (2019) combines the\nrevision-theoretic technique with graph-theoretic tools and\nfixed-point constructions in order to represent a threefold\nclassification of paradoxical sentences (liar-like, truth-teller-like,\nand revenge sentences) within a single model.\n",
