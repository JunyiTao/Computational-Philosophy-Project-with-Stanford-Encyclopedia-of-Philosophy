    "main_text": "Occasional Thoughts\n3. Occasional Thoughts\n\nOccasional Thoughts in Reference to a Vertuous or Christian\nLife (1705) develops Lady Masham\u2019s views on practical\nmorality that she had set out in A Discourse. The book is\nalso, in part, an answer to Mary Astell\u2019s The Christian\nReligion as Professed by a Daughter of the Church which was\npublished as a reply to A Discourse Concerning the Love of\nGod. In a discussion of the role of reason in religious matters\nand the relationship between religion and virtuous conduct, Lady\nMasham sets out to defend reasonable Christianity from Deism on the\none hand and superstition on the other. Against the Deists, Masham\ninsists on the importance of revelation and faith and denies that\nnatural religion based purely on reason is possible. On the other hand\nreligious belief that ignores the role of reason in religion is mere\nsuperstition and will result in bigotry and atheism, because \u201can\nIrrational Religion can never Rationally be conceived to come from\nGod\u201d (Occasional Thoughts, p. 36). (In Masham\u2019s\nview, Roman Catholicism, with its stress on the externals of religion\nis largely superstition). For her part, Lady Masham emphasises the\nmoral aspect of religion, its practical application, rather than\ndoctrinal content. She shares Locke\u2019s view that virtuous living\nis more important than religious ceremonial. Like Locke in the\nEpistola de tolerantia, she argues that moral conduct is\ncentral to religious practice. Accordingly she argues that morality\nand religion should not be separated in religious instruction.\nFurthermore, civil and religious liberties are necessary for the\nexercise of virtue. \n\nIn developing her arguments about practical morality she argues that\nthe exercise of virtue is grounded in civil and religious liberty.\n\u201cFreedom or Liberty of action\u201d, she insists, is \u201cthe\ngreatest endowment that a Created Being is capable of\nheeding\u201d(Occasional Thoughts, pp. 68\u201378). Education is\nthe key means to inculcate virtue. And virtue is to be learned not\nthrough precept but by developing a rational understanding of moral\nprinciples. Lack of education and poor education are destructive\nsocially, morally and spiritually, a point which she develops into a\nfeminist argument for the education of women. This centres on the\ntraditional role of mothers in the moral education of their children.\nHighly critical of the limited and distorted education which girls\nreceive, she argues that a mother cannot give her children a\nmeaningful moral education if she herself is denied education.\n",
