    "main_text": "Patrilineage and Gender Oppression || Wifely Fidelity and Widowhood\n5.3 Wifely Fidelity and Widowhood\n\nNon-gender specific virtues as enumerated in Liu Xiang\u2019s\nLien\u00fc zhuan dissipated from the subsequent dynastic\nhistorical accounts of exemplary women\u2019s biographies; women in\nthe post-Han era were praised specifically for adhering to their\ngender roles, such as wifely fidelity, widow chastity, and maternal\nrectitude (Raphals 1998: Appendix 5). The power of these historical\naccolades for women obviously reinforced the limited roles and social\nvenues available for women. One way for women to garner social\naccolades is through observing spousal fidelity, and there is a long\ntradition in Confucian texts that teach the virtue of wifely fidelity.\nAccording to the Liji,\n\n\nFaithfulness is the requisite in all service of others, and\nfaithfulness is the virtue of a wife. Once mated, she will not change\nfor her entire life; therefore, when her husband dies, she will not\nremarry. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nSimilarly, as stated in the Baihutong in the context of the\nwifely duty to remonstrate with the husband:\n\n\nwhen the remonstration is not taken, the wife cannot thus leave the\nhusband. Once mated, the wife cannot change for her entire life. There\nis no justification for deserting one\u2019s husband.\n(Baihutong, \u201cJianzheng\u201d chapter)\n\n\nWifely fidelity to patrilineage is cumulated in the observance of\nwidowhood, and since the Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013220 CE) onward,\nwidowhood had been recognized as one of the many honored deeds by the\nimperial court with a \u201ctestimonial of merit\u201d that elevated\none\u2019s entire household. The cult of widowhood reached its height\nduring the Qing dynasty (1644 to 1912 CE) where widowhood became a\nreligious expression that enshrined chaste widows at the state and\ncounty\u2019s expense (Mann 1987: 37\u201356). Considering the fact\nthat a woman is ritually without rank, title, or name of her own, for\nher to earn an imperial merit\u2014which at times comes with monetary\nawards\u2014is itself an impressive achievement. But as impressive as\nthis might seem, social accolades for women, unlike those for men,\nmust be mediated through patrilineage; she is exemplary because of her\nservitude to the men of her kin.\n\nWithout that kinship tie, it would be nearly impossible for a woman to\nacquire social recognition. One only needs to compare the biographies\nof \u201cexemplary women\u201d (lien\u00fc\n\u5217\u5973) with the \u201cexemplary [men\u2019s]\nbiographies\u201d (liezhuan \u5217\u50b3)\u2014both are\nstandard entries in each dynastic historical records compiled and\nwritten by Confucian court historians\u2014and it is clear that there\nwas no such kinship meditation needed for men of virtue, even though\nmany of them were recorded to have benefited from their mothers\u2019\ninstructions. Men are exemplary mainly because of their own doings,\nwhereas women are memorialized, if and only if, they are tied to\npatrilineage as filial daughters, faithful wives, chaste widows, or\ndevoted mothers.\n\nIn prioritizing the perpetuation of patrilineage, women often\nparticipate in gender oppressive practices such as female infanticide,\nchild bride, and concubinage. It is in the wife\u2019s interest that\nher new family has a male heir through which she anchors her place in\nthe family, since her failure to produce children is one of\nthe seven grounds for her expulsion from the marriage. Through\nwhatever means necessary, a wife must ensure that there is sufficient\nfamily resources for her to produce or procure the coming of a male\nheir. Perpetuating patrilineage is also codified into the very\npractice of filiality (xiao \u5b5d). As shown in this famed\nsaying of Mencius,\n\n\nThere are three unfilial things, and to have no posterity is the\ngreatest. King Shun married without informing his parents was because\notherwise he would have no posterity. An exemplary person considers\nthis so treating what he did as if he had informed them.\n(Mencius 4A26)\n\n\nNot to inform one\u2019s parents of one\u2019s marriage is a serious\nritual infraction, but the imperative to perpetuate one\u2019s\nlineage overrides that ritual requirement. The perpetuation of\npatrilineage, hence, is of utmost importance.\n",
