    "main_text": "Compatibilism in Transition || Focus upon the Reactive Attitudes\n3.3 Focus upon the Reactive Attitudes\n\nIn \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d (1962), P.F. Strawson broke\nranks with the classical compatibilists. Strawson developed three\ndistinct arguments for compatibilism, arguments quite different from\nthose the classical compatibilists endorsed. But more valuable than\nhis arguments was his general theory of what moral responsibility is,\nand hence, what is at stake in arguing about it. Strawson held that\nboth the incompatibilists and the compatibilists had misconstrued the\nnature of moral responsibility. Each disputant, Strawson suggested,\nadvanced arguments in support of or against a distorted simulacrum of\nthe real deal.\n\nTo understand moral responsibility properly, Strawson invited his\nreader to consider the reactive attitudes one has towards\nanother when she recognizes in another\u2019s conduct an attitude of\nill will. The reactions that flow naturally from witnessing ill will\nare themselves attitudes that are directed at the perpetrator\u2019s\nintentions or attitudes. When a perpetrator wrongs a person, she, the\nwronged party, typically has a personal reactive attitude of\nresentment. When the perpetrator wrongs another, some third party, the\nnatural reactive attitude is moral indignation, which amounts to a\n\u201cvicarious analogue\u201d of resentment felt on behalf of the\nwronged party. When one is oneself the wronging party, reflecting upon\nor coming to realize the wrong done to another, the natural reactive\nattitude is guilt.\n\nStrawson wanted contestants to the free will debate to see more\nclearly than they had that excusing a person \u2014 electing not to\nhold her blameworthy \u2014 involves more than some objective\njudgment that she did not do such and such, or did not intend so and\nso, and therefore does not merit some treatment or other. It involves\na suspension or withdrawal of certain morally reactive attitudes,\nattitudes involving emotional responses. On Strawson\u2019s view,\nwhat it is to hold a person morally responsible for wrong conduct\nis nothing more than the propensity towards, or the\nsustaining of, a moral reactive attitude like indignation. Crucially,\nthe indignation is in response to the perceived attitude of ill will\nor culpable motive in the conduct of the person being held\nresponsible. Hence, Strawson explains, posing the question of whether\nthe entire framework of moral responsibility should be given up as\nirrational (if it were discovered that determinism is true) is\ntantamount to posing the question of whether persons in the\ninterpersonal community \u2014 that is, in real life \u2014 should\nforswear having reactive attitudes towards persons who wrong others,\nand who sometimes do so intentionally. Strawson invites us to see that\nthe morally reactive attitudes that are the constitutive basis of our\nmoral responsibility practices, as well as the interpersonal relations\nand expectations that give structure to these attitudes, are deeply\ninterwoven into human life. These attitudes, relations and\nexpectations are so much an expression of natural, basic features of\nour social lives \u2014 of their emotional textures \u2014 that it\nis practically inconceivable to imagine how they could be\ngiven up.\n",
