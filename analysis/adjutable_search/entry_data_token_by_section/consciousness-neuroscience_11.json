    "main_text": "Methods for Tracking Consciousness || The Intentional Action Inference\n2.5 The Intentional Action Inference\n\nMetacognitive and introspective judgments result from intentional\naction, so why not look at intentional action, broadly construed, for\nevidence of consciousness? Often, when subjects perform perception\nguided actions, we infer that they are relevantly conscious. It would\nbe odd if a person cooks dinner and then denies having seen any of the\ningredients. That they did something intentionally provides evidence\nthat they were consciously aware of what they acted on. An emphasis on\nintentional action embraces a broader evidential basis for\nconsciousness. Consider the Intentional Action Inference to\nphenomenal consciousness:\n\n\nIf some subject acts intentionally, where her action is guided by a\nperceptual state, then the perceptual state is phenomenally\nconscious.\n\n\nAn epistemic version takes the action to provide good evidence that\nthe state is conscious. Notice that introspection is typically an\nintentional action so it is covered by the inference. In this way, the\nInference effectively levels the evidential playing field:\nintrospective reports are simply one form among many types of\nintentional actions that provide evidence for consciousness. Those\nreports are not privileged.\n\nThe intentional action inference and no-report paradigms highlight the\nfact the science of consciousness has largely restricted its\nbehavioral data to one type of intentional action, introspection. What\nis the basis of privileging one intentional action over others?\nConsider the calibration issue. For many types of intentional action\ndeployed in experiments, scientists can calibrate performance by\nobjective measures such as accuracy. This has not been done for\nintrospection of consciousness, so scientists have privileged an\nuncalibrated measure over a calibrated one. This seems empirically\nill-advised. On the flip side, one worry about the intentional action\ninference is that it ignores guidance by unconscious perceptual states\n(see sections\n 4\n and\n 5.3.1).\n",
