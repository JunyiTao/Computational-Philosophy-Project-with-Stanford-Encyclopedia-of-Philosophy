    "main_text": "Nietzsche\u2019s Metaethics || Nietzsche\u2019s Anti-Realism\n4. Nietzsche\u2019s Lack of a Political Philosophy\n\nWhen the Danish critic Georg Brandes (1842\u20131927) first\nintroduced a wider European audience to Nietzsche\u2019s ideas during\npublic lectures in 1888, he concentrated on Nietzsche\u2019s\nvitriolic campaign against morality and what Brandes dubbed (with\nNietzsche\u2019s subsequent approval) Nietzsche\u2019s\n\u201caristocratic radicalism.\u201d On this reading, Nietzsche was\nprimarily concerned with questions of value and culture\n(especially the value of morality and its effect on culture), and his\nphilosophical standpoint was acknowledged to be a deeply\nilliberal one: what matters are great human beings, not the\n\u201cherd.\u201d The egalitarian premise of all contemporary moral\nand political theory \u2014 the premise, in one form or another, of\nthe equal worth or dignity of each person \u2014 is simply absent in\nNietzsche\u2019s work. This naturally leads to the question: what\npolitics would Nietzsche recommend to us in light of his repudiation\nof the egalitarian premise?\n\nA striking feature of the reception of Nietzsche in the last thirty\nyears years is the large literature that has developed on\nNietzsche\u2019s purported political philosophy. Two positions have\ndominated the literature: one attributes to Nietzsche a commitment to\naristocratic forms of social ordering (call this the\n\u201cAristocratic Politics View\u201d [e.g., Detwiler 1990]), while\nthe other denies that Nietzsche has any political philosophy at all\n(call this the \u201cAnti-Politics View\u201d [e.g., Hunt 1985,\nLeiter 2002/2015]). \n\nEven the casual reader knows, of course, that Nietzsche has intense\nopinions about everything, from German cuisine to the\nunparalleled brilliance (in Nietzsche\u2019s estimation) of\nBizet\u2019s operas, not to mention various and sundry\n\u201cpolitical\u201d matters. The interpretive question, however,\nis whether scattered remarks and parenthetical outbursts add up to\nsystematic views on questions of philosophical significance about\npolitics.\n\nIs Nietzsche even interested in political philosophy? Nussbaum (1997:\n1) declares that, \u201cNietzsche claimed to be a political thinker,\nindeed an important political thinker\u201d, but she can produce no\nclear textual evidence in support of that contention. She notes that,\n\u201cIn Ecce Homo he announced that he was \u2018a bringer\nof glad tidings like no one before me,\u2019 and that those glad\ntidings are political\u201d (1997: 1). In fact, Nietzsche does\nnot say the \u201ctidings\u201d are political; indeed, as\nthe earlier discussion of his critique of morality shows, the\n\u201ctidings\u201d are directed only at select readers, nascent\nhigher human beings, for whom morality is harmful. That this section\nfrom Ecce Homo (IV:1) concludes with the hyperbolic claim\nthat only with Nietzsche does \u201cthe earth [first] know[\u00a0]\ngreat politics\u201d does as little to establish that he has\na political philosophy as the claim, in the very same\npassage, that Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cglad tidings\u201d will\ncause \u201cupheavals, a convulsion of earthquakes, a moving of\nmountains and valleys\u201d does to establish that he has a\ngeological theory.\n\nNussbaum goes on to suggest that \u201cserious political\nthought\u201d (1997: 2) must address seven precise topics (e.g.,\n\u201cprocedural justification\u201d [\u201cprocedures\u2026that\nlegitimate and/or justify the resulting proposals\u201d for\n\u201cpolitical structure\u201d], \u201cgender and the\nfamily,\u201d and \u201cjustice between nations\u201d) \u2014 most\nof which, of course, Nietzsche does not address. (Marx does not\naddress most of them either.) Instead of drawing the natural\nconclusion \u2014 Nietzsche was not interested in questions of\npolitical philosophy \u2014 she, surprisingly, decries his\n\u201cbaneful influence\u201d in political philosophy (1997:\n12).\n\nThose who claim to find a political philosophy in Nietzsche typically\nrely on a handful of passages \u2014 most often, sections 56\u201357\nof The Antichrist, but also section BGE 257 on\n\u201cslavery\u201d \u2014 as the slender evidence on the basis of\nwhich elaborate views about the ideal forms of social and political\norganization are attributed to Nietzsche. In particular, Nietzsche is\nsaid to endorse (in A 56\u201357) the caste-based society associated\nwith the Hindu Laws of Manu as his political ideal:\n\nThe order of castes, the supreme, the dominant law, is merely\nthe sanction of a natural order, a natural lawfulness of the\nfirst rank, over which no arbitrariness, no \u201cmodern idea\u201d\nhas any power\u2026Nature, not Manu, distinguishes the pre-eminently\nspiritual ones, those who are pre-eminently strong in muscle and\ntemperament, and those, the third type, who excel neither in one\nrespect nor in the other, the mediocre ones \u2014 the last as the\ngreat majority, the first as the elite. (A 57)\n\n\nThis reading, however, does not withstand scrutiny, as Thomas Brobjer\n(1998) has argued. As Brobjer notes, the only other published\ndiscussion of the laws of Manu, in Twilight of the Idols, is\nhighly critical, not laudatory (pp. 304\u2013305); Nietzsche\u2019s\ndiscussions of comparable caste-based societies are all critical (pp.\n308\u2013309); and Nietzsche\u2019s unpublished notebooks contain\nnumerous entries on the theme \u201ca critique of the Laws of\nManu\u201d (pp. 310\u2013312). The passage from The\nAntichrist only seems laudatory when read out of\ncontext; as Brobjer remarks:\n\n[Nietzsche\u2019s] purpose [in these passages in The\nAntichrist] is to make the contrast with Christianity as strong\nas possible, to provoke the reader, to make the reader\n\u201crealize\u201d that even the laws of Manu\u2026 is higher and\nmore humane than Christianity. Whereas Christianity destroys, the\nintention at least of the laws of Manu was to save and protect. (1998,\npp. 312\u2013313)\n\n\nIn other words, the rhetorical context of the passage is\ncrucial, though it is typically ignored by commentators defending the\nAristocratic Politics View. Indeed, the passage quoted above from A 57\nis specifically introduced to illustrate the use of the \u201choly\nlie\u201d (the lie being, in this case, the claim that \u201cnature,\nnot Manu\u201d distinguishes the castes). And as even the title of\nthe book would suggest, Nietzsche\u2019s target is Christianity, and\nthe laws of Manu are invoked simply to drive home that point. Thus,\nalthough Manu and Christianity both depend on lies, at least\nthe Manu lies, according to Nietzsche, are not put in the service of\nChristian ends, i.e., \u201cpoisoning, slander, negation of life,\ncontempt for the body, the degradation and self-violation of man\nthrough the concept of sin\u201d (A 56). Similarly, Nietzsche goes\nout of his way to show that Christian views of female sexuality\ncompare unfavorably with Manu views (A 56).\n\nThe most balanced and careful defense of the Aristocratic Politics\nView, Detwiler (1990), is not able to adduce much additional evidence.\nFor example, Detwiler (1990) ends up relying quite heavily on an essay\nthe 27-year-old Nietzsche never published (1990: 39\u201341, 63). As to\npassages in the \u201cmature\u201d corpus, Detwiler adduces ones\nthat \u201cappear[\u00a0] to have explicit political\nimplications\u201d (1990: 43; cf. 44), or that \u201cstrongly\nsuggest\u2026political consequences\u201d (1990: 45\u201346), or\nthat \u201craise the issue of troubling political implications of\nNietzschean immoralism\u201d (1990: 49). But\n\u201cimplications\u201d and \u201cconsequences\u201d are one\nthing, and having a political philosophy another. (See in this regard\nthe discussion of BGE 257 in Huddleston 2019: 113 n. 39). The canon of\npolitical philosophers is composed of thinkers (like Hobbes, Locke,\nRousseau, and Mill) who have philosophical views about political\nquestions \u2014 the justification of state power, the liberty of the\nindividual, political legitimacy, etc. \u2014 not thinkers whose\nviews about other topics merely had\n\u201cimplications\u201d for politics. As the conscientious Detwiler\nadmits: \u201c[t]he political implications of Nietzsche\u2019s\nrevaluation of values are never center stage for long\u201d (1990:\n58).\n\nYet it is natural to think that Nietzsche\u2019s attack on morality\ndoes indeed have real political implications. When Nietzsche commends\nthe laws of Manu for \u201cmak[ing] possible the higher and the\nhighest types\u201d (A 57), this resonates, all too obviously, with\nNietzsche\u2019s central concern that morality is harmful to the\nhighest types of human beings. Yet the undeniable\n\u201cresonance\u201d fails to show that Nietzsche endorses\nthe laws of Manu. Most obviously, the \u201chigher types\u201d\nprotected by the laws of Manu \u2014 essentially a priestly caste\n\u2014 have nothing in common with the nascent Goethes that concern\nNietzsche. Nietzsche\u2019s worry for these potential higher types\nis, as we have seen, that they suffer from false\nconsciousness, i.e., the false belief that \u201cmorality in the\npejorative sense,\u201d i.e., MPS, is good for them. MPS is a threat\nto the flourishing of nascent Goethes, and it is this flourishing that\ninterests Nietzsche above all. It would suffice for Nietzsche\u2019s\npurposes that nascent Goethes give up their faith in MPS \u2014 in\nother words, it is individual attitudes not political structures that\nare Nietzsche\u2019s primary object (\u201cThe ideas of the herd\nshould rule in the herd,\u201d says Nietzsche, \u201cand not reach\nout beyond it\u201d [WP 287]). That should hardly be surprising if we\nrecall Nietzsche\u2019s sustained hostility to politics throughout\nhis career, as defenders of the Anti-Politics View emphasize.\n\nEven in the early Untimely Meditations, this hostility is\nalready evident. So, for example, Nietzsche comments:\n\nEvery philosophy which believes that the problem of existence is\ntouched on, not to say solved, by a political event is a joke- and\npseudo-philosophy. Many states have been founded since the world\nbegan; that is an old story. How should a political innovation suffice\nto turn men once and for all into contented inhabitants of the earth?\n[That people think the answer to existential questions might come from\npolitics shows] that we are experiencing the consequences of the\ndoctrine\u2026that the state is the highest goal of mankind and that\na man has no higher duty than to serve the state: in which doctrine I\nrecognize a relapse not into paganism but into stupidity. It may be\nthat a man who sees his highest duty in serving the state really knows\nno higher duties; but there are men and duties existing beyond this\n\u2014 and one of the duties that seems, at least to me, to be higher\nthan serving the state demands that one destroys stupidity in every\nform, and therefore in this form too. That is why I am concerned with\na species of man whose teleology extends somewhat beyond the welfare\nof a state\u2026, and with [this kind of man] only in relation to a\nworld which is again fairly independent of the welfare of a state,\nthat of culture. (U III:4)\n\n\nThe same, vaguely anarchistic attitude is apparent in Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, where Nietzsche calls the \u201cstate\u2026the\ncoldest of all cold monsters\u201d and remarks, aptly enough, that\n\u201cthe state\u2026whatever it says it lies\u2026Everything\nabout it is false\u201d (Z I:11). \u201cOnly where the state ends,\nthere begins the human being who is not superfluous\u201d (Z I:11) Of\ncourse, it is only the latter individual that really\ninterests Nietzsche. And who is that individual? The next section (Z\nI:12) tells us: he is the one who values his \u201csolitude,\u201d\nwhich is precisely what the \u201cmarketplace\u201d of politics\nviolates, with its \u201cshowmen and actors of great [sic]\nthings.\u201d \u201cFar from the market place and from fame happens\nall that is great\u201d (Z I:12): in other words, great things (and\ngreat people) are to be found far from the realms of politics and\neconomics.\n\nPassages like these seem to support the Anti-Politics View. On this\naccount, Nietzsche occasionally expresses views about political\nmatters, but, read in context, they do not add up to a theoretical\naccount of any of the questions of political philosophy. He is more\naccurately read, in the end, as a kind of esoteric moralist,\ni.e., someone who has views about human flourishing, views he wants to\ncommunicate at least to a select few. \u201cThis book belongs to the\nvery few,\u201d he says of The Antichrist, though the point\nholds more generally. Indeed, Nietzsche is clearly describing his own\nwork when he writes in an earlier book that,\n\nIt is not by any means necessarily an objection to a book when anyone\nfinds it impossible to understand: perhaps that was part of the\nauthor\u2019s intention \u2014 he did not want to be understood by\njust \u2018anybody.\u2019 All the nobler spirits and tastes select\ntheir audience when they wish to communicate; and choosing that, one\nat the same time erects barriers against \u2018the others.\u2019 All\nthe more subtle laws of any style have their origin at this point:\nthey at the same time keep away, create a distance, forbid\n\u2018entrance,\u2019 understanding, as said above \u2014 while\nthey open the ears of those whose ears are related to ours. (GS 381)\n\n\nOr similarly: \u201cOur highest insights must \u2014 and should\n\u2014 sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are\nheard without permission by those who are not predisposed and\npredestined for them\u201d (BGE 30). Nietzsche, the esoteric\nmoralist, wants to reach only select individuals \u2014 those nascent\nhigher human beings who are \u201cpredisposed and predestined\u201d\nfor his ideas \u2014 and alter their consciousness about morality.\nThe larger world, including its forms of political and economic\norganization, is simply not his concern.\n\nEven without a political philosophy, however, there remain disturbing\nquestions about Nietzsche\u2019s critique of morality and its\npolitical implications. For example, when Nietzsche objects\nthat morality is an obstacle to \u201cthe highest power and splendor\npossible\u201d to man, one is tempted to object that this gets things\nperversely backwards. For surely it is the lack of morality\nin social policy and public institutions \u2014 a lack which permits\nwidespread poverty and despair to persist generation upon generation;\nthat allows daily economic struggle and uncertainty to define the\nbasic character of most people\u2019s lives \u2014 that is most\nresponsible for a lack of human flourishing. Surely, in a more moral\nsociety, with a genuine commitment to social justice and human\nequality, there would be far more Goethes, far more creativity and\nadmirable human achievement. As Philippa Foot has sharply put it:\n\u201cHow could one see the present dangers that the world is in as\nshowing that there is too much pity and too little egoism\naround?\u201d (1973, p. 168).\n\nHere, though, one must remember the earlier discussion of\nNietzsche\u2019s critique of morality. Consider the Nietzsche who\nasks: \u201cWhere has the last feeling of decency and self-respect\ngone when even our statesmen, an otherwise quite unembarrassed type of\nman, anti-Christians through and through in their deeds, still call\nthemselves Christians today and attend communion?\u201d (A 38).\nClearly this Nietzsche is under no illusions about the extent to which\npublic actors do not act morally. Indeed, Nietzsche continues in even\nmore explicit terms: \u201cEvery practice of every moment, every\ninstinct, every valuation that is translated into action is\ntoday anti-Christian: what a miscarriage of falseness must\nmodern man be, that he is not ashamed to be called a\nChristian in spite of all this!\u201d (A 38). What, then, is going on\nhere? If Nietzsche is not, contrary to Foot\u2019s suggestion,\nembracing the absurd view that there is too much pity and altruism in\nthe world, what exactly is his critical point?\n\nRecall Nietzsche\u2019s paradigmatic worry: that a nascent creative\ngenius will come to take the norms of MPS so seriously that he will\nfail to realize his genius. Rather than tolerate (even welcome)\nsuffering, he will seek relief from hardship and devote himself to the\npursuit of pleasure; rather than practice what Nietzsche calls\n\u201csevere self-love\u201d, and attend to himself in the ways\nrequisite for productive creative work, he will embrace the ideology\nof altruism, and reject \u201cself-love\u201d as improper, and so\nforth. It is not, then, that Nietzsche thinks people practice\ntoo much altruism \u2014 after all, Nietzsche tells us that egoistic\nactions \u201chave hitherto been by far the most frequent\nactions\u201d (D 148) \u2014 but rather that they believe\ntoo much in the value of altruism, equality, happiness and the other\nnorms of MPS. Even though there is neither much altruism nor equality\nin the world, there is almost universal endorsement of the\nvalue of altruism and equality \u2014 even, notoriously (and\nas Nietzsche seemed well aware), by those who are its worst enemies in\npractice. So Nietzsche\u2019s critique is that a culture in the grips\nof MPS, even without acting on MPS, poses the real obstacle to\nflourishing, because it teaches potential higher types to disvalue\nwhat would be most conducive to their creativity and value what is\nirrelevant or perhaps even hostile to it. Nietzsche\u2019s worry, in\nshort, is that the man in the grips of MPS becomes\n\u201cimprisoned among all sorts of terrible concepts\n[schrekliche Begriffe]\u201d that leave him \u201csick,\nmiserable, malevolent against himself: full of hatred against the\nsprings of life, full of suspicion against all that was still strong\nand happy\u201d (TI VII:2, emphasis added).\n\nSo, contrary to Foot, Nietzsche is not claiming that people are\nactually too altruistic and too egalitarian in their\npractice; he is worried that (as a consequence of the slave revolt in\nmorals, etc.) they are now \u201cimprisoned\namong\u2026.concepts\u201d of equality and altruism, and that this\nconceptual vocabulary of value is itself the obstacle to the\nrealization of certain forms of human excellence. That is a very\ndifferent charge, one that raises subtle psychological questions that\nno one, to date, has really explored.\n\nTo be sure, one might still object that if our society really\nwere more altruistic and egalitarian, more individuals would have the\nchance to flourish and do creative work. Yet it is precisely this\nmoral optimism common, for example, to utilitarians and Marxists\n\u2014 this belief that a more moral society would produce more\nopportunity for more people to do creative work \u2014 that Nietzsche\ndoes, indeed, want to question. Nietzsche\u2019s illiberal attitudes\nin this regard are once again apparent; he says \u2014 to take but\none example \u2014 that, \u201cWe simply do not consider it\ndesirable that a realm of justice and harmony [Eintracht]\nshould be established on earth\u201d (GS 377). It is bad enough for\nNietzsche that MPS values have so far succeeded in saying,\n\u201cstubbornly and inexorably, \u2018I am morality itself, and\nnothing besides is morality\u2019\u201d (BGE 202); it could only be\nworse on his view if more and more of our actions were really brought\ninto accord with these values. For Nietzsche wants to urge \u2014\ncontrary to the moral optimists \u2014 that in a way largely\nunappreciated and (perhaps) unintended a thoroughly moral\nculture undermines the conditions under which the most splendid human\ncreativity is possible, and generates instead a society of\nZarathustra\u2019s \u201clast men\u201d (Z P:5):\n\n\u201cWhat is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a\nstar?\u201d thus asks the last man, and he blinks.\n\n\nThe earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makes\neverything small. His race is as in eradicable as the flea-beetle; the\nlast man lives longest.\n\n\u201cWe have invented happiness,\u201d say the last men, and they\nblink\u2026.\n\n\nIf we are trained always to think of happiness and comfort and safety\nand the needs of others, we shall cut ourselves off from the\npreconditions for creative excellence on the Nietzschean picture:\nsuffering, hardship, danger, self-concern, and the rest.\n\nConsider a particularly powerful statement of this view. Speaking of\nthose \u201celoquent and profoundly scribbling slaves of the\ndemocratic taste and its \u2018modern ideas\u2019\u201d who seek to\npromote \u201cthe universal green-pasture happiness of the\nherd\u201d and who take \u201csuffering itself\u2026for something\nthat must be abolished\u201d (BGE 44), Nietzsche retorts that when we\nlook at,\n\n\u2026how the plant \u201cman\u201d has so far grown most\nvigorously to a height \u2014 we think that this has happened every\ntime under the opposite conditions, that to this end the dangerousness\nof his situation must first grow to the point of enormity, his power\nof invention and simulation (his \u201cspirit\u201d) had to develop\nunder prolonged pressure and constraint into refinement and\naudacity\u2026. We think that\u2026everything evil, terrible,\ntyrannical in man, everything in him that is kin to beasts of prey and\nserpents, serves the enhancement of the species \u201cman\u201d as\nmuch as its opposite does. Indeed, we do not even say enough when we\nsay only that much. (BGE 44)\n\n\nAt the end of this passage, Nietzsche does hint at a role for morality\nas well \u2014 it is just that what morality opposes is equally\nimportant. He, of course, qualifies this by suggesting that even to\nconcede their equal importance may \u201cnot even say enough\u201d:\nthat is, perhaps there will not be much role for morality at all in\nthe conditions under which \u201cthe plant \u2018man\u2019\u201d\nwill grow to its greatest heights. But notice that, even in this\npassage, what is called for is not a political\ntransformation, but an individual one, that of the nascent\nhigher human being: it is \u201chis situation\u201d that\n\u201cmust first grow to the point of enormity\u201d and it is\n\u201chis power of invention and simulation\u201d that\n\u201chad to develop under prolonged pressure and constraint into\nrefinement and audacity.\u201d As he writes in a Nachlass\nnote of 1887, regarding those \u201chuman beings who are of any\nconcern to me\u201d: \u201cI wish [them] suffering, desolation,\nsickness, ill-treatment, indignities \u2014 I wish that they should\nnot remain unfamiliar with profound self-contempt, the torture of\nself-mistrust, the wretchedness of the vanquished\u201d (WP 910).\nThis is not the outline of a political program, but rather a severe\nregimen for the realization of individual potential \u2014 at least\nfor the select few.\n",
