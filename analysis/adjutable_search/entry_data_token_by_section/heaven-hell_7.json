    "main_text": "Free\u2013will Theodicies of Hell || Moral Freedom and Irreparable Harm\n3.2 Moral Freedom and Irreparable Harm\n\nConsider now the two conditions under which we humans typically feel\njustified in interfering with the freedom of others (see Talbott\n1990a, 38). We feel justified, on the one hand, in preventing one\nperson from doing irreparable harm\u2014or more accurately, harm that\nno human being can repair\u2014to another; a loving father\nmay thus report his own son to the police in an effort to prevent the\nson from committing murder. We also feel justified, on the other hand,\nin preventing our loved ones from doing irreparable harm to\nthemselves; a loving father may thus physically overpower his daughter\nin an effort to prevent her from committing suicide.\n\nNow one might, it is true, draw a number of faulty inferences from\nsuch examples as these, in part because we humans tend to think of\nirreparable harm within the context of a very limited timeframe, a\nperson\u2019s life on earth. Harm that no human being can repair may\nnonetheless be harm that God can repair. It does not follow,\ntherefore, that a loving and omnipotent God, whose goal is the\nreconciliation of the world, would prevent every suicide and every\nmurder; it follows only that such a God would prevent every harm that\nnot even omnipotence could repair at some future time, and neither\nsuicide nor murder is necessarily an instance of that kind of\nharm. So even though a loving God might sometimes permit murder, such\na God would never permit one person to annihilate the soul of another\nor to destroy the very possibility of future happiness in another; and\neven though a loving God might sometimes permit suicide, such a God\nwould never permit genuine loved ones to destroy the very possibility\nof future happiness in themselves either. The latter conclusion\nconcerning suicide is no doubt the more controversial, and Jonathan\nKvanvig in particular has challenged it (see Kvanvig 1993,\n83\u201388). But whatever the resolution of this particular debate,\nperhaps both parties can agree that God, as Creator, would deal with a\nmuch larger picture and a much longer timeframe than that with which\nwe humans are immediately concerned.\n\nSo the idea of irreparable harm\u2014that is, of harm that\nnot even omnipotence could ever repair\u2014is critical at this\npoint. It is most relevant, perhaps, in cases where someone imagines\nsinners freely choosing annihilation (Kvanvig), or imagines them\nfreely making a decisive and irreversible choice of evil (Walls), or\nimagines them freely locking the gates of hell from the inside (C. S.\nLewis). But proponents of the so-called escapism understanding of hell\ncan plausibly counter that hell is not necessarily an instance of such\nirreparable harm, and Raymond VanArragon in particular raises the\npossibility that God might permit some loved ones to continue forever\nrejecting God in a non-decisive way that would not, at any given time,\nharm them irreparably (see VanArragon 2010, 37ff; see also Kvanvig\n2011, 52). Here it is perhaps worth noting how broadly VanArragon\ndefines the term \u201crejecting God\u201d (see 2010,\n30\u201331)\u2014so broadly, in fact, that any sin for which one is\nmorally responsible would count as an instance of someone rejecting\nGod. He thus explicitly states that rejecting God in his broad sense\nrequires neither an awareness of God nor a conscious decision, however\nconfused it may be, to embrace a life apart from God. Accordingly,\npersistent sinning without end would never result, given such an\naccount, in anything like the traditional hell, whether the latter be\nunderstood as a lake of fire, the outer darkness, or any other\ncondition that would reveal the full horror of separation from God\n(given the traditional Christian understanding of such separation).\nNeither would such a sinner ever achieve a state of full clarity. For\ngiven VanArragon\u2019s understanding of libertarian freedom,\ncontinuing to sin forever would require a perpetual context of\nambiguity, ignorance, and misperception. \n",
