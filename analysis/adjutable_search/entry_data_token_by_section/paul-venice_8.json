    "main_text": "Theology: the Doctrine of Divine Ideas\n7. Philosophy of Nature: Potency, Act, and Prime Matter\n\nAs happens very often in the case of medieval authors, the salient\nfeatures of Paul of Venice\u2019s general view about potency and act\n(and possible and real as well) are partly determined by the concrete\napplications that the theory pursues. The specific areas that the\ntheory is called to cover are: (1) the (meta)physical explanation of\nthe nature and modalities of change and coming to be; (2) the\ndetermination of the form of existence of universals with respect to\nsingulars; and (3) the explanation of the process of creation. Paul\nproceeds by divisions that allow him to order this subject according\nto a tree-like scheme that follows in some ways that adopted by\nPorphyry in the chapter on species in his Isagoge. We can\nleave out the minor divisions to concentrate on the main one only. At\nthe basis of Paul\u2019s doctrine of act and potency we find a\ndistinction between potency considerd as a disposition to exist, or\nlogical possibility (the potentia ad esse), and potency as a\ndisposition (proper to something which already exists) to perform or\nachieve something or to undergo a change, or natural possibility (the\npotentia in esse) (see SN, pars vi, ch. 7, fol.\n97ra). This distinction should allow him to separate the\nlogical-theoretical sphere (the potentia ad esse) from the\nphysical one (the potentia in esse). The example chosen to\nillustrate the nature of the potentia ad esse, that is, the\nbirth of the Antichrist, manifests, however, an internal ambiguity in\nhis doctrine. The existence of the Antichrist, in fact, is a possible\nnot in the sense of non-impossible (i.e., something not contradictory\nin itself) but in the sense of that which, while not yet real, is\nhowever infallibly destined to become real.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Italian master does not always adequately\ndistinguish between the concept of potency (potentia) as pure\nlogical possibility (as it was taught by Duns Scotus) and that of\npotency as preformation, that is, a sort of latent pre-existence, in\nsome other thing, of what will be actual/real but is not yet such.\nThis last sense of potency is the one prevalent in Paul, who seems to\nuse the logical sense only in theological contexts, in connection with\nthe theme of divine omnipotence, which enables God to create many more\nspecies than He did (see QdU, conclusio decima). As\na consequence, in the theory of potency and act of Paul of Venice, two\ndifferent fields of investigation converge: the one related to the\nproblem of changes of state and the one related to the\nanalysis of the modal concept of possible. Nicoletti tends to\ntrace back in some way the notion of (logical) possible to that of\ndisposition to undergo a change. He therefore denies that there are\npossibilities that will never come into being (In Metaph.,\nIX, tr. 1, ch. 2, fol. 342rb): \u201cThe opinion of those who claimed\nthat something is possible even if it will never be was false\u201d\n(Falsa fuit opinio dicentium aliquid posse esse quod tamen nullo\nmodo erit). Yet, such a denial \u2013 he adds \u2013 is valid\nony within the philosophy of nature; it must be rejected from a\ntheological point of view ( ibidem).\n\nThe thesis (which he shares with Wyclif and his followers) of the\ncomposition of potency and act proper to all categorial items\n(universal and individual substances, and universal and individual\naccidents \u2013 see SN, pars vi, ch. 4, fol. 95rb) is in\naccord with this approach. In Paul\u2019s opinion, each categorial\nitem is act, and hence form, with respect to the entity that according\nto the high-low direction immediately precedes it in the categorial\nline (linea praedicamentalis), and in potency, and hence\nmatter, with respect to the entity that immediately follows it \u2013\ntaking the terms \u2018matter\u2019 and \u2018form\u2019 in a\nbroad sense (communiter), since \u2018matter\u2019 stands for any\npotential nature and \u2018form\u2019 for any act (or form) contracting some\ngiven nature (cf. ibidem). For instance, the highest genus of\nthe category of substance is immediately composed of act and potency;\nintermediate genera and lowest species immediately of genus and\ndifference, and mediately of act and potency (because of the supreme\ngenus, which is the original constitutive element of their natures);\nand individuals immediately of essence and being (that is to say, as\nPaul puts it, of specific nature and an individuating principle, or\nratio individualis, and mediately of genus and difference\n(because of the lowest species), and of act and potency (because of\nthe highest genus) (SN, pars vi, ch. 4, fol. 95rb; In\nMetaph., V, tr. 2, ch. 2, fol. 184ra; and book XII, tr. 1, ch. 4,\nfols. 433va and 434ra-b; In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, fols. 54vb, 55ra, and 55rb-va).Thus, for example,\nmammal is in act with respect to animal, of which it\nactualises a potentiality, and in potency with respect to\nfeline, which in turn actualises a potentiality of\nmammal. The Porphyrian (see Isagoge, chs. on genus\nand on species) and neo-Platonic idea of potentiality as a productive\ncapacity reinforces this interpretation. As a result, what is\npotential, because it is more universal, comes first and is more\nimportant than what is actual, and therefore real (In\nMetaph., V, tr. 2, ch. 4, fol. 193ra) \u2013 a scale of values\nthat overturns the Aristotelian one. As is evident, the notions of act\nand potency are central to Paul\u2019s ontology, since potency and\nact constitute the first, basic, and most universal type of\ncomposition of created beings. Every other type of composition somehow\npresupposes it.\n\nIf the concept of act is taken up quite faithfully from Aristotle,\nPaul\u2019s concept of potency conflates the Aristotelian one with\nthe Neoplatonic one. For this reason, the Aristotelian pre-eminence of\nact over potency is weakened in more than one aspect \u2013 as we\nhave already seen. And finally, the pure potentiality of Aristotelian\nprime matter is read in terms of the theory of rationes\nseminales, and therefore as an innate disposition to receive any\nform. In Paul\u2019s opinion, prime matter has in itself the\n\u201cright\u201d places to set every form, since it is like the\ncoffer in which are contained in potency all the forms of the things\nthat will be generated in nature. His theory combines the two\nAristotelian notions of matter (that of matter as the ultimate\nsubstratum, common to all the materials of which things are made, and\nthat of matter as a pure potentiality) with Augustine\u2019s notion\nof rationes seminales, the \u201cgerminative\u201d\nprinciples of natural species. According to Paul, with the exception\nof those forms directly created by God, such as celestial\nintelligences and human souls (see In Metaph., V, tr. 2, ch.\n4, fol. 193ra), all substantial forms derive from some passive potency\n(defined as the capacity to undergo change) present in prime matter\nand really distinct from it. Such potencies are universal (so to\nspeak), in the sense that the continuous generation of singular things\nto which they give rise is aimed at the maintenance in being of a\nspecific nature. Every potency is capable of producing a form of a\ncertain kind an infinite number of times. Hence, no natural form\npasses from absolute non-being to being, but from potency to act,\nsince it has always had its own kind of existence (potentialiter\net seminaliter) as a sort of disposition in prime matter. Such\npotencies (or dispositions) are perpetual, ingenerable, and\nincorruptible, coeternal with matter itself. As a consequence,\naccording to Paul, the generation of natural forms is like a passage\nfrom an indefinite and potential being, typical of what is universal,\nto the full and actual existence of what is singular. In order to\nproduce a complete thing (namely, a thing composed by matter and form)\nfrom matter, in addition to the raw material with its dispositions (or\npotencies), the intervention of natural agents, both singular and\nuniversal, is required. The potencies of matter, inasmuch as they\norder matter to the production of complete things different in species\nare, in a broad sense, \u201cgerminative\u201d principles of the\nnatural species. On the contrary, a ratio seminalis in the\nstrictest sense of the term is that disposition, caused by an agent in\na suitable material, which predisposes that material to receive a form\nof the same kind of the form proper to the agent itself \u2013 a\ndisposition which is by nature capable of operating even without the\nnatural agent. Thus the potencies of matter are like the primordial\nseeds of the species (that are to be produced) \u201csown\u201d in\nthe matter itself (SN, pars vi, ch. 6, fol. 96va)\n\nAccording to Paul of Venice, such \u201cgerminative\u201d principles\n(rationes seminales) are of three types: substantial,\nqualitative, and relative (SN, pars vi, ch. 7, fol. 97rb).\nAll of them are really distinct from matter and are based on a unique\npassive potency (i.e., a disposition) that is identified with the\nessence, so to speak, of prime matter (SN, pars vi, ch. 7,\nfol. 97vb) \u2013 and in this reference to a sort of essence of prime\nmatter we can see the influence of Scotism. As a consequence, this\nbasic potency is a kind of second-order potency, since the forms it\nbrings into being are nothing but the potencies of prime matter, which\nin themselves are dispositional properties. Moreover, this general\npotency of prime matter consists precisely in the property of being in\npotency with respect to any kind of form, and therefore in being able\nto receive all of them (ibidem). The ultimate outcome of\nPaul\u2019s approach is a form of necessitarianism ex\nhypothesi, in that every possible object, although not necessary\nin itself, would nevertheless be necessary with respect to the\nconditions and circumstances that bring it into being, since\nconditions and circumstances have to produce it, if they have the\ncapacity to do so.\n\nPaul is aware of the particular form of necessitarianism inherent in\nhis approach to that issue; hence, he tries to mitigate its effects,\nin order to safeguard the contingency of human events as well as\ndivine freedom, and to loosen, at the level of individuals, the rigid\ncausal chain implied by his theory of potency, act, and prime matter.\nIn the last part of his Quaestio de universalibus, where he\nexpounds his conception of divine exemplarism (decima\nconclusio) and in his commentary on the Isagoge (cap.\nde specie) and in that on the Categories (cap.\nde substantia), where he speaks of individual substances, he\nstates that (1) the properties and dispositions proper to individuals\nare not precisely determined, but vary randomly within a more or less\nwide spectrum of possibilities whose limits are fixed by the specific\nform (In Metaph., IX, tr. 1, ch. 2, fol. 341vb). And, (2)\nalthough reasoning as natural philosophers we should recognise that\nthe models according to which God created things are finite in number\nand correspond to the types of things that actually exist, reasoning\nas theologians we come to understand that God did not create all\npossible species, but only some of them, because divine ideas as\nrationes (i.e., principles of knowledge and not models for\ncreation) are infinite in number and correspond to the purely\npossible, i.e., to that whose notion is not contradictory\n(QsU, decima conclusio, ms. Paris, BN 6433B, fol.\n135ra). This means, for example, that Socrates\u2019 height, weight,\nand actions are not established a priori in their individual\nnature or measure, and neither is Socrates\u2019 life, but their\ntypical form is. As a human being, Socrates\u2019 features and\nbehavior cannot deviate from certain physical-biological parameters\nand certain laws, but the concrete ways of their realisation are not\ngiven a priori and determined by his individual substance. As\na whole, human beings would actualise, i.e., make real, in time (if\nthey had endless time at their disposal) all the infinite\npossibilities inherent in their nature (a sort of \u2018weak\u2019\nprinciple of plenitude applied to species only), but no human\nindividual as such (i.e., as an individual) is obliged by nature to\nactualise precisely those potentialities/possibilities that he/she\nmakes real.\n\nIn this way, Paul of Venice implicitly states two theses concerning\nindividuals: (1) the thesis of the partial indeterminacy of their\nfeatures and properties, and (2) that of the substantial\nunpredictability of their behavior. According to him, the only way to\nascertain the presence of some potency, i.e., of a real possibility,\nis to ascertain its realisation, i.e., the passage to actuality.\nMoreover, he seems to admit the existence in individuals of\npotencies/possibilities that will not reach actuality \u2013 that is,\nof capacities that will never be developed. All men can laugh, and\nthis potency/possibility is real even in those who have never laughed\nand never will (commentary on the Isagoge, cap. de\nproprio). Yet, we can reasonably infer the presence in a given\nindividual of a undeveloped potency/possibility if we have previously\nobserved its actualisation in many other individuals of the same\nspecies. What is absolutely inconceivable from this perspective is the\npossibility of a real novelty, i.e., a real change, in the universe.\nIn this view, whatever effect is produced (the \u2018act\u2019) is\nimmediately traced back to a pre-existing reality (the\n\u2018potency\u2019) which is not different from the effect it is\nintended to explain, but is, in some way, the effect itself at an\nincomplete stage of being. What is now real was already present in\nreality, but in a different way. Creation itself, as we have seen, is\ninterpreted according to this scheme by means of the theory of divine\nexemplarism. In conclusion, it can be said that in a sense\nthe world has always existed, if not in act then at least virtually\n(as a real and not merely logical possibility) in God\u2019s mind and\nomnipotence.\n",
