    "main_text": "The Baghdad Aristotelians\n6. The Baghdad Aristotelians\n\nThe Metaphysics held an undisputable importance for the\nschool of Christian Aristotelians that flourished in Baghdad during\nthe X\u2013XI centuries, who took over from the Aristotelian scholars\nof Alexandria the project of providing a systematic commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s works. Many members of this school\u2014starting\nfrom its founder, Ab\u016b Bi\u0161r Matt\u0101 ibn Y\u016bnus (d.\n940), through to its later leader, Ab\u016b Zakariy\u0101\u02be\nYa\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b (d. 974), and to one of its last\nrepresentatives, \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ibn Zur\u02bfa (d.\n1008)\u2014contributed decisively to the translation of the\nMetaphysics into Arabic. Moreover, some of these authors are\ncredited with the translation into Arabic of parts of the main Greek\ncommentaries on the Metaphysics (Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius on book Lambda, by Ab\u016b Bi\u0161r Matt\u0101), or\nthey were reported to be familiar with the Arabic translation of\nfurther Greek commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s work, as well as with\ntreatises on metaphysics by some of Aristotle\u2019s immediate\ndisciples (for example, Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b was said\nto be familiar with the commentary on book Beta by Syrianus and the\noriginal treatise on metaphysics by Theophrastus of Eresus). Finally,\nnumerous literal commentaries on the Metaphysics, following\nin the footsteps of Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 exegetical style,\nwere produced within the school. Thus, later sources inform us that\nAb\u016b Bi\u0161r Matt\u0101 commented on books Alpha Elatton,\n\u0392eta (III) and Theta (VIII) of the Metaphysics; he is\nalso quoted in Avicenna\u2019s exegesis of book Lambda (XII).\nYa\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b\u2019s commentary on book Alpha\nElatton is extant. Ab\u016b l-Fara\u01e7 ibn al-\u1e6cayyib\u2019s\n(d. 1043) commentary on the Metaphysics, preserved in\nfragments in Hebrew translation, is famous for its length and its\nextremely detailed character, an exegetical style decidedly resented\nby Avicenna.\n\nThe literal style of exegesis allowed Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn\n\u02bfAd\u012b to introduce religious concerns into his\nMetaphysics commentary. The broadly speaking\n\u201cPlatonic\u201d theories of some of his treatises devoted to\nontological issues, like the postulation of divine forms within the\ndiscussion of the mode of existence of universals, can be seen as\nPlatonizing solutions to Aristotelian problems, rather than signs of\naffiliation to non-Aristotelian philosophical traditions.\n",
