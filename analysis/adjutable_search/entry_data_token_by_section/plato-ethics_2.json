    "main_text": "The early dialogues: Examining life || The quest for definition\n2.2 The quest for definition\n\r\nIt may be helpful to begin with a consideration of the method of\r\nethical inquiry that Socrates is portrayed as using in the early\r\ndialogues. A reflection on the meaning of Socrates\u2019 quest for\r\ndefinitions in the early dialogues suggests that Plato cannot have\r\nbeen blind to the sterility of a purely negative way of argument, or\r\nif he was blind at first, his blindness cannot have lasted long, for\r\nSocrates\u2019 quest for definitions has important consequences.\r\nFirst and foremost, definitions presuppose that there is a definable\r\nobject; that is to say, it must have a stable nature. Nothing can be\r\ndefined that is of a variable nature. In addition, the object in\r\nquestion must be a unitary phenomenon, even if its unity may be\r\ncomplex. If definitions are to provide the basis of knowledge, they\r\nrequire some kind of essentialism. This presupposition is indeed made\r\nexplicit in the Euthyphro, where Plato employs, for the first\r\ntime, the terminology that will be characteristic of his full-fledged\r\ntheory of Forms. In response to Euthyphro\u2019s enumeration of\r\nvarious examples of pious behavior, Socrates demands an account of\r\nthe one feature (Euthphr. 5d:\r\nidea; 6d: eidos; 6e: paradeigma) that is\r\ncommon to all cases of what is holy or pious. Despite this pregnant\r\nterminology, few scholars nowadays hold that the Euthyphro\r\nalready presupposes transcendent Forms, in a realm of their own\r\n\u2013 models that are only incompletely represented by their\r\nrepresentatives under material conditions. The terms eidos\r\nand idea had preserved their original meaning of\r\n\u2018look\u2019 or \u2018shape\u2019 into the classical age, but\r\nthey were also often used in the more abstract sense of\r\n\u2018form\u2019, \u2018sort\u2019, \u2018type\u2019, or\r\n\u2018kind\u2019. No more than piety or holiness in the abstract\r\nsense seems to be presupposed in the discussion of the\r\nEuthyphro. There is, at any rate, no mention of any\r\nseparation of a sensible and an intelligible realm, let alone of an\r\nexistence of \u2018the holy itself\u2019, as a transcendent\r\nentity.\n\r\nThe passage in the Euthyphro where Socrates asks Euthyphro to\r\nidentify the one feature that is common to all that is holy\r\nor pious makes intelligible, however, the reason why Plato felt\r\nencouraged to develop the conception of transcendent Forms. The\r\nrequisite unity and invariance of entities such as \u2018the\r\nholy\u2019, \u2018the beautiful\u2019, \u2018the just\u2019, or\r\n\u2018the equal\u2019, necessarily prompts reflections on their\r\nontological status and on the appropriate means of access to them.\r\nGiven that they are the objects of definition and the models of their\r\nordinary representatives, there is every reason not only to treat them\r\nas real but also to assign to them a higher kind of unity and\r\nperfection. And once this step has been taken, it is only natural to\r\nmake certain epistemological adjustments, for access to paradigmatic\r\nentities is not to be expected through ordinary experience but\r\npresupposes some special kind of intellectual insight. It seems, then,\r\nthat once Plato had accepted invariant and unitary objects of thought\r\nas the subject of definition, he was predestined to follow the path\r\nthat led him to adopt a metaphysics and epistemology of transcendent\r\nForms. The very fact that mathematics was already an established\r\nscience with rigorous standards and unitary and invariant objects\r\nseems to have greatly enhanced Plato\u2019s confidence in applying\r\nthe same standards in moral philosophy. It led him to search for\r\nmodels of morality beyond the limits of everyday experience. This, in\r\nturn, explains the development of his theory of recollection and the\r\npostulate of Forms as transcendent, immaterial objects as the basis of\r\nboth reality and thought that he refers to in the Meno and\r\nthat he presents more fully in the Phaedo.\n\r\nWe do not know when, precisely, Plato adopted this mode of thought,\r\nbut it stands to reason that his contact with the Pythagorean school\r\non his first voyage to Southern Italy and Sicily around 390 BC played\r\na major role in that development. Mathematics as a model-science has\r\nseveral advantages. It deals with unchangeable entities that have\r\nprecise definitions. It also makes plausible the claim that the\r\nessence of these entities cannot be comprehended in isolation but only\r\nin a network of interconnections that have to be worked out at the\r\nsame time as each particular entity is defined. Thus, to understand\r\nwhat it is to be a triangle, it is necessary \u2013 inter\r\nalia \u2013 to have a clear notion of the nature of points,\r\nlines, planes, and their interrelations. That Plato was aware of that\r\nfact is indicated in his introduction of the theory of recollection in\r\nthe Meno, 81d: \u201cAs the whole of nature is akin, and the\r\nsoul has learned everything, nothing prevents a man, after recalling\r\none thing only \u2013 a process men call learning \u2013 discovering\r\neverything else for himself, if he is brave and does not tire of the\r\nsearch; for searching and learning, are, as a whole, recollection\r\n(anamnesis).\u201d The somewhat mystifying claim of an\r\n\u2018overall kinship\u2019 is then illuminated by the famous\r\n\u2018mathematical experiment\u2019 (Me. 82b\u201385c).\r\nThe slave manages, with some pushing and pulling by Socrates, and\r\nthanks to some illustrations drawn in the sand, to double the area of\r\na given square. In the course of this interrogation, the disciple\r\ngradually discovers the relations between the different lines,\r\ntriangles, and squares. That Plato regards these interconnections as\r\ncrucial features of knowledge is subsequently confirmed by the\r\ndistinction that Socrates draws between knowledge and true belief\r\n(97b\u201398b). As he argues, true beliefs are unreliable because\r\nthey behave like \u2018the statues of Daedalus that easily run away\r\nas long as they are not tied down\u2019. The requisite \u2018tying\r\ndown\u2019 happens (98a) \u201cby giving an account of the reason\r\nwhy. And that, Meno my friend, is recollection, as we previously\r\nagreed. After they are tied down, in the first place, they become\r\nknowledge, and then they remain in place.\u201d This explanation\r\nindicates that, according to Plato, knowledge does not consist in a\r\nmere mental \u2018gazing\u2019 at isolated models but rather in\r\nuncovering the invariant relations and interrelations that constitute\r\nthe objects in question.\n\r\nThe complexity underlying Plato\u2019s theory of the Forms as it\r\nsurfaces in the Phaedo is easily overlooked because its\r\ndiscussion initially suggests that recollection is no more than the\r\ngrasping of concepts. Thus, the concept of \u2018exact equality in\r\nsize\u2019 is prompted by the perception of more or less\r\nequal-seeming sticks and stones (74a\u2013e). The same condition\r\napplies to the other examples of Forms, 65d\u2013e: \u201cDo we say\r\nthat there is such a thing as the Just itself or not? And the\r\nBeautiful, and the Good? [\u2026] I am speaking of all things such\r\nas Tallness, Health, Strength, and in a word, the reality of all other\r\nthings, that which each of them essentially is.\u201d But Plato does\r\nnot employ his newly established metaphysical entities as the basis\r\nfor working out a definitive conception of the human soul and the\r\nappropriate way of life in the Phaedo. Rather, he confines\r\nhimself to warnings against the contamination of the soul by the\r\nsenses and their pleasures, and quite generally against corruption by\r\nworldly values. He gives no advice concerning human conduct beyond\r\nthe recommendation of a general abstemiousness from worldly\r\ntemptations. This seems a rather austere picture of human life, and an\r\negocentric one, to boot, for nothing is said about relations between\r\nhuman beings beyond Socrates\u2019 exhortations that his friends\r\nshould likewise take care of their souls as best they can. It is\r\nunclear whether this otherworldly and ascetic attitude is the sign of\r\na particularly pessimistic period in Plato\u2019s life or whether it\r\nmerely reflects the circumstances of the discussion \u2013\r\nSocrates\u2019 impending death. But as long as this negative or\r\notherworldly attitude towards the physical side of human nature\r\nprevails, no interest is to be expected on the part of Plato in nature\r\nas a whole \u2013 let alone in the principles of the cosmic order\r\n(but cf. 5.1 below). But it is not only the apparent asceticism that\r\nstands in the way of a wider perspective. Socrates himself seems to\r\nhave been quite indifferent to the study of nature. While in the\r\nPhaedo Socrates confesses his inability to deal with the\r\ncauses of natural processes, the Apology contains an\r\nenergetic denial of any concern with natural philosophy on\r\nSocrates\u2019 side. The accusations that depict him as \u201ca\r\nstudent of all things in the sky and below the earth\u201d are quite\r\nunfounded (18c); he has never conversed on such issues at all, and the\r\nattribution to him of the Anaxagorean tenet that the sun is a stone\r\nand the moon consists of earth is a sign of his accusers\u2019\r\nrecklessness (26d\u2013e). Similarly, in the Phaedrus,\r\nSocrates explains his preference for the city and his avoidance of\r\nnature (230d): \u201cLandscapes and trees have nothing to teach me\r\n\u2013 only the people in the city can do that.\u201d That Plato is\r\nnot distorting the facts here is confirmed by the testimony of\r\nXenophon, who is equally emphatic about Socrates\u2019 repudiation of\r\nthe study of heavenly phenomena and his concentration on human affairs\r\n(Memorabilia I 1.15\u201316). If Plato later takes a much\r\nmore positive attitude towards nature in general, this is a\r\nconsiderable change of focus. In the Phaedo, he quite\r\ndeliberately confines his account of the nature of heaven and earth,\r\nwith its heavenly order and hellish geography, to the myth about the\r\nsoul\u2019s afterlife (108d\u2013114c). As he states in conclusion,\r\nthis mythical depiction is not to be taken literally but as an\r\nencouragement to heed its moral message and to take care of\r\none\u2019s soul (114d\u2013e). This is as constructive as Plato gets\r\nin his earlier treatment of the principles of ethics.\n",
