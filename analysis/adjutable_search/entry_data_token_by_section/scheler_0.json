    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nMax Scheler was born on August 22, 1874. He was raised in a\nwell-respected orthodox Jewish family in Munich. Although he was not a\nparticularly strong student, Scheler did show early promise and\ninterest in philosophy, particularly in the works of Friedrich\nNietzsche. As a youth, he identified himself as a social democrat and\nenthusiastic Marxist. In the fall of 1894, Scheler started his\nuniversity studies in Munich, but by the fall of 1895 had enrolled in\nBerlin. Although he had applied to study medicine in Berlin, he\nstudied primarily philosophy and sociology, attending most notably the\nlectures of Wilhelm Dilthey and Georg Simmel.\n\nFrom Berlin, Scheler moved to Jena in 1896 to finish his studies under\nthe guidance of Rudolf Eucken. Rudolf Eucken was a tremendously\npopular philosopher at the time, winning the Nobel Prize for\nliterature in 1908, but it was Eucken\u2019s ideas regarding the\ninner quest for a spiritual life of every human being that primarily\ndrew Scheler\u2019s attention. It was in Jena that Scheler completed\nboth his dissertation and habilitation, and where he began his career\nin philosophy. It was also during his time in Jena that he took a trip\nto Heidelberg in 1898 and met Max Weber, who also had a significant\nimpact on his thought.\n\nWhile holding his position as Privatdozent in Jena, Scheler met Edmund\nHusserl at a party in 1901 and then, a year later, read\nHusserl\u2019s Logical Investigations. The remainder of his\nlife would be dedicated to the development and the progress of\nphenomenology. During this time, Scheler was also reading much of\nFrench philosophy and was a major factor in introducing Henri\nBergson\u2019s work to Germany\u2019s intellectual circles.\n\nIn 1906, Scheler moved his family to Munich and started his position\nthere as Privatdozent. With Theodor Lipps, Scheler established a\ncircle of the \u201cMunich Phenomenologists.\u201d The early group\nconsisted of Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Moritz Geiger and Theodor Conrad,\nall of whom were students of Lipps. Dietrich von Hildebrand, Hedwig\nMartius, Herbert Leyendecker and Maximillian Beck later joined the\ngroup.\n\nDue to controversies surrounding the separation from his first wife\nand reported affairs with students, Scheler lost his teaching\nprivileges. From 1910 to 1919, he would have to earn a living as a\nprivate scholar, lecturer and freelance writer. Despite the economic\nhardships brought about by the loss of his position in Munich, these\nyears were some of Scheler\u2019s most productive: he published major\nworks such as Phenomenology and Theory of the Feeling of Sympathy\nand of Love and Hate (1913), Formalism in Ethics and\nNon-Formal Ethics of Value (Part 1 1913, Part 2 1916), The\nGenius of War and the German War (1915).\n\nA major contributing factor to Scheler\u2019s productivity at this\ntime was his introduction to the G\u00f6ttingen circle of\nphenomenology. Along with the great master, Husserl, this circle\nincluded such young and promising thinkers as Adolf Reinach, Hedwig\nMartius, Roman Ingarden, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 and Edith Stein. He\nmet and later joined the circle after the invitation in 1912 to give\nprivate lectures in G\u00f6ttingen. Because Scheler was forbidden to\nteach at a German university his lectures would often have to be held\nin hotel rooms rented by his close friend Dietrich von Hildebrand. It\nwas also at this time that Scheler became co-editor, along with\nHusserl, Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Moritz Geiger and Adolf Reinach, of\nthe greatly influential journal, Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und\nph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung.\n\nAfter years of struggling to make ends meet as a private lecturer and\nfreelance writer, Scheler received an invitation in 1918 from Konrad\nAdenaur to join the faculty of the newly founded research institute\nfor the social sciences in Cologne. The intent was to have Scheler\nserve as the Catholic thinker for the institute. Scheler, officially\njoining the faculty in 1919, was once again allowed to teach at a\nGerman university. During his time in Cologne, he wrote his major work\non religion, On the Eternal in Man (1921).\n\nThe circle of influence continued to grow for Scheler. During his time\nin Berlin and in Cologne, Scheler would meet and correspond regularly\nwith prominent, German intellectuals such as Max Brod, Franz Werfel,\nMartin Buber, Arnold Zweig, Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Sombart, Albert\nEinstein, Alfred Kerr, Walter Rathenau, Paul Tillich, Romano Guardini\nand Ernst Bloch. His circle of collaboration and discussion was not\nlimited to philosophy. Scheler corresponded with the leading\npsychologists and natural scientists such as Wertheimer, K\u00f6hler,\nBuytendijk, and Wasserman. Musicians, poets and literary scholars such\nas Eduard Erdmann, Otto Klemperer, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Rainer Maria\nRilke, Romain Rolland, Ernst Robert Curtius were also part of his\ncircle of influence. A very close friend of Scheler\u2019s in Cologne\nup until his death was the painter Otto Dix.\n\nThis diverse array of friends and collaborators is reflected in both\nthe diversity and originality of Scheler\u2019s thought at this time.\nFor example, Scheler\u2019s work, Die Wissenformen und die\nGesellschaft (The Forms of Knowledge and Society), was\nresponsible for the promulgation of a new field of study, the\nsociology of knowledge, and was one of the first works in Germany that\nprovided an in depth analysis of American pragmatism. As was common\nfor Scheler, he wrote many different manuscripts at once. While\nwriting on the sociology of knowledge, he was working on his\nphilosophical anthropology (Die Sonderstellung des Menschen\nand the manuscripts compiled in Gesammelte Werke 12),\nmetaphysics (Idealismus und Realismus and manuscripts\ncompiled in Gesammelte Werke 11), politics (Politik und\nMoral, Die Idee des Ewigen Friedens) and history\n(Der Mensch im Weltalter des Ausgleichs). During this time,\nScheler lectured extensively throughout Germany, focusing much of his\neffort to confront the rise of fascism in Germany and Europe.\n\nOnce again, Scheler\u2019s personal life (the divorce from his second\nwife and marriage to his third) conflicted with his position at the\nuniversity as the Catholic philosopher. The restrictions Scheler felt\nwere not merely personal, but also intellectual. Disappointed by the\nCatholic Church\u2019s conservatism and political failures in the\nreconstructive efforts after the war, Scheler became increasingly\ncritical of religious institutions and dogmas. He made considerable\neffort to distance himself from the Catholic Church and characterize\nhis work as philosophical, not religious, in nature. With the growing\ntensions at Cologne, Scheler welcomed the offer of a professorial\nposition in Frankfurt in 1927 and was eager to work with the Critical\nTheorists in Frankfurt such as Max Horkeimer and the young Theodor\nAdorno. During the spring of 1928, Scheler\u2019s health continued to\nworsen and he suffered from a series of heart attacks most likely due\nto the 60\u201380 cigarettes he smoked each day. His deteriorating\nhealth forced him to cancel his extensive travel plans abroad, and on\nMay 19, 1928 Scheler died in a hospital in Frankfurt from\ncomplications of a severe heart attack.\n",
