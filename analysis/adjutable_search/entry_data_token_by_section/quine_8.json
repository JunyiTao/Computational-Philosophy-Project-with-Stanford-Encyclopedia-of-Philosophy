    "main_text": "The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism || Meaning and Quinean Analyticity\n3.3 Meaning and Quinean Analyticity\n\nAs we have just seen, even sentences which we cannot imagine rejecting\nmight, in principle, be rejected. As Quine says: \u2018no statement\nis immune to revision\u2019 (1951, 43; see Ebbs 2017, Ch. 8). This\nclaim of Quine\u2019s has attracted a good deal of attention, and is\nsometimes thought to be shocking or even paradoxical. In the context\nof his debate with Carnap, however, it is not, by itself, at all\nsurprising. For Carnap too, any sentence can be revised; he would\ninsist, however, that in the case of some sentences, the analytic\nones, a revision involves a change of language, and thus of the\nmeaning of the words used in the sentence. So the idea of meaning, and\nsameness of meaning, occupies a crucial role in the debate over\nanalyticity.\n\nQuine\u2019s initial arguments against the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction seek to cast doubt on the idea that there is a notion of\nmeaning which is clear enough to use in defining a notion of\nanalyticity. He explores various proposals and finds them wanting.\n(See especially Quine 1951.) Here too a crucial role is played by\nholism. One apparently clear conception of meaning is that the meaning\nof a sentence is given by the experiences which would confirm it;\nholism, however, implies that the idea of confirmation does not apply\nto individual sentences, considered in isolation from the theories of\nwhich they are parts. (For criticism see Fodor and Lepore 1992; for a\ncounter to Fodor and Lepore see Heal 1994; for later Quine on holism\nsee his 1991.)\n\nQuine\u2019s scepticism about the idea of meaning is much criticized.\nWe will mention two criticisms. First, what standards of clarity is he\nemploying, when he says that the notion of analyticity is\ninsufficiently clear? The answer, not explicit in Quine (1951), is\nthat the standards are those indicated by our discussion in the\nprevious section; Quine is asking for an explanation which is\nacceptable by his naturalistic standards (see Lugg 2012). Such an\nexplanation would not presuppose an idea of meaning, and would use\nsuch ideas as definition or convention only in ways which are\njustified by the literal sense of those terms. Second, some responses\nto Quine\u2019s position here argue that it has obviously absurd\nconsequences, such as that meaningful discourse would be impossible or\nthat we could not understand our language. (See, for example, Grice\nand Strawson, 1956.) But Quine\u2019s scepticism about\nmeanings does not lead to any scepticism about\nmeaningfulness. If we think of meaningfulness as a matter of\nhaving a meaning then we may think that our words cannot be\nmeaningful unless there are meanings. But such a way of thinking is,\nQuine claims, quite misleading. In Quine 1953, he offers a rough and\nready behavioural account of meaningfulness; it is clear from the way\nthe account proceeds that the success of something along those lines\nwould be of no help at all in defining synonymy or analyticity.\n\nWe said above that Quine seeks \u2018to cast doubt\u2019 on the idea\nof meaning, and on the use of that idea to explain the distinction\nbetween those changes of doctrine which involve a change of meaning\nand those which do not, and thus also to explain analyticity. One\nmight read Quine 1951 and get the impression that he is not merely\ncasting doubt but wholly rejecting these ideas. In later works,\nhowever, he himself suggests a definition of analyticity. A sentence\nis analytic for a given native speaker \u2018if he learned the truth\nof the sentence by learning to use one or more of its words\u2019\n(Quine 1991, 270; see also Quine 1974, 78\u201380). It is analytic\nwithout qualification if it is analytic for all native speakers. By\nthis criterion, some obvious truths, such as \u2018Bachelors are\nunmarried\u2019, will presumably count as analytic. If we think of\nthe set of analytic sentences as closed under logical consequence, as\nQuine suggests, then, he says, all first-order logical truths\n\u2018would then perhaps qualify as analytic\u2019 (Quine 1991,\n270). Along with this, he comes to accept that certain revisions of\nbelief do involve a change of meaning, presumably in a sufficiently\nclear sense of meaning (Quine 1991, 270).\n\nNow it might seem as if Quine completely withdraws his earlier\ncriticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction and thus, presumably,\nof Logical Empiricism as a whole. But in fact this is not so. One\nconsideration here is the scope of Quinean analyticity. The idea will\nperhaps (as Quine says) include first-order logic, but it will not\ninclude mathematics; on this count alone, it is clear that it will not\ndo what Carnap requires of the idea of analyticity. An even more\nimportant consideration is that Quine\u2019s version of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction is not an epistemological distinction.\nSome changes of doctrine involve changes of meaning, others do not. In\nQuine\u2019s view, however, this does not mean that the two sorts of\nchange must have different epistemological bases. To the contrary: as\nwe saw in 3.1, Quine rejects the Principle of Tolerance and, with it,\nthe idea that a change of language takes place on a different kind of\nepistemological basis from a change of theory within a language. His\nacceptance of a limited conception of analyticity does not change this\npicture. As he says: \u201cI recognize the notion of analyticity in\nits obvious and useful but epistemologically insignificant\napplications\u201d (1991, 271; emphasis added).\n\nOn the interpretation advanced here, Quine\u2019s rejection of the\nPrinciple of Tolerance is the deepest aspect of his disagreement with\nCarnap. Quine sees all our cognitive endeavours, whether they involve\nformulating a new language or making a small-scale theoretical change,\nas having the same very general aim of enabling us to deal with the\nworld better; all such endeavours have the same very general kind of\njustification, namely, as contributing to that end. In this picture,\nthere is no basis for Carnap\u2019s insistence that philosophy is in\nprinciple different from science. Philosophy, as Quine sees it, has no\nspecial vantage point, no special method, no special access to truth.\nHere we have the crucial idea of Quine\u2019s naturalism, discussed\nin the previous section.\n",
