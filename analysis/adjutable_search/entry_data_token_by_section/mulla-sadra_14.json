    "main_text": "Eschatology || The Eleven Principles\n5.1 The Eleven Principles\n\nThe holism of Mulla Sadra\u2019s approach may be seen in his\nexamination of eschatology. One of the key points of contention in\nmediaeval Islamic thought concerned the possibility of metempsychosis,\nan idea that had permeated through the Neo-pythagoreanising\nNeoplatonism of Late Antiquity into Islam. Previous Islamic\nphilosophers had even demonstrated some sympathy with the idea. But\nMulla Sadra, consistent with the tradition of Avicenna, rejected the\nnotion as inimical to his vision of the nature of the soul, its\npre-existence, its faculties and its afterlife. Before criticising\nmetempsychosis, Mulla Sadra argued that a proper understanding of the\nprinciples of his philosophical method will make clear his objection\nto the idea. In a number of works, he sets out eleven principles of\nhis method that show the relevance of metaphysics to psychology and\neschatology. In the relevant section of the Four Journeys,\nMulla Sadra (2001\u20135, IX: 261\u201372) describes these eleven\nprinciples:\n\nFirst, existence is a foundational principle and essence is an\naccidental property that pertains specifically to an existent.\nSignificantly, this also means that existence is not merely a concept\nthat one ascribes to a property that pertains to essences that we\nanalyse in extra-mental reality.\n\nSecond, and concomitantly, existence is the principle of\nindividuation, not essence. This amounts to saying the existence is\nthe prime determinant of identity and the bundled structure for\nvarious properties that pertain to an identity over time.\n\nThird, it is in the nature of existence that it is singular but graded\nand modulated. It undergoes intensification and debilitation. The\ndifferent essences that attach to existence in the mind are\ndifferentiated by species, genus and accident.\n\nFourth, and concomitantly, because existence undergoes\nintensification, substances that are manifestations of existence are\nconstantly in flux and undergo motion.\n\nFifth, and related point, every composite essence is defined and\nidentified by its form and not by its matter, because hylomorphism\naffirms that form is the active principle and matter the passive.\n\nSixth, following from the earlier point about identity, the identity\nof every single person is defined by its existence and this applies to\nheavenly bodies as well.\n\nSeventh, the identity of the body is determined by its soul and not by\nits materiality. Human identity remains constant through the\neternality of the soul from its form in the womb to childhood through\nto old age and into the grave and beyond into the world of the\nafterlife.\n\nEighth, the imaginative faculty (which in Mulla Sadra\u2019s\nepistemology following Avicenna is critical for the production of new\nknowledge) is an immaterial property that does not inhere in a\nparticular part of the brain but rather transcends the body and hence\n(in Platonic terms) can unite with like immaterial intelligible in the\nhigher noetic world.\n\nNinth, imaginative forms are produced by the soul and are not merely\nstates in which the soul finds itself, that is, they are not passively\nreceived.\n\nTenth, corporeal and other physical forms became actualised through\nmatter receiving dispositions and states.\n\nEleventh and final point, existence is graded and has three primary\nplanes (defined again in Platonic terms): the world of material and\nsensible forms, the world of immaterial forms, and the world of\nintelligible forms. Humans, for example, retain the same existence and\nidentity across these three planes of being hence denying the need for\nmetempsychosis. Metaphysics therefore determines one\u2019s view of\neschatology and the afterlife and provides the principles for\nunderstanding one\u2019s origins, present states and the future.\n",
