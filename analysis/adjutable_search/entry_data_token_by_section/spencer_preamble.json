    "main_text": "\n\nHerbert Spencer (1820\u20131903) is typically, though quite wrongly,\nconsidered a coarse social Darwinist. After all, Spencer, and not\nDarwin, coined the infamous expression \u201csurvival of the\nfittest\u201d, leading G. E. Moore to conclude erroneously in\nPrincipia Ethica (1903) that Spencer committed the\nnaturalistic fallacy. According to Moore, Spencer\u2019s practical\nreasoning was deeply flawed insofar as he purportedly conflated mere\nsurvivability (a natural property) with goodness itself (a non-natural\nproperty).\n\nRoughly fifty years later, Richard Hofstadter devoted an entire\nchapter of Social Darwinism in American Thought (1955) to\nSpencer, arguing that Spencer\u2019s unfortunate vogue in late\nnineteenth-century America inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham\nSumner\u2019s visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism. For\nHofstadter, Spencer was an \u201cultra-conservative\u201d for whom\nthe poor were so much unfit detritus. His social philosophy\n\u201cwalked hand in hand\u201d with reaction, making it little more\nthan a \u201cbiological apology for laissez-faire\u201d (Hofstadter,\n1955: 41 and 46). But just because Carnegie interpreted\nSpencer\u2019s social theory as justifying merciless economic\ncompetition, we shouldn\u2019t automatically attribute such\njustificatory ambitions to Spencer. Otherwise, we risk uncritically\nreading the fact that Spencer happened to influence popularizers of\nsocial Darwinism into our interpretation of him. We risk falling\nvictim to what Skinner perceptively calls the \u201cmythology of\nprolepsis.\u201d\n\nSpencer\u2019s reputation has never fully recovered from Moore and\nHofstadter\u2019s interpretative caricatures, thus marginalizing him\nto the hinterlands of intellectual history, though recent scholarship\nhas begun restoring and repairing his legacy. Happily, in\nrehabilitating him, some moral philosophers have begun to appreciate\njust how fundamentally utilitarian his practical reasoning was. And\nsome sociologists have likewise begun reassessing Spencer.\n\nIntellectual history is forever being rewritten as we necessarily\nreinterpret its canonical texts and occasionally renominate\nmarginalized thinkers for canonical consideration. Changing\nphilosophical fashions and ideological agendas invariably doom us to\nreconstructing incessantly our intellectual heritage regardless the\ndiscipline. Take political theory instance. Isaiah Berlin\u2019s\nunderstandable preoccupation with totalitarianism induced him to read\nT. H. Green and Bernard Bosanquet as its unwitting accomplices insofar\nas both purportedly equated freedom with dangerously enriched,\nneo-Hegelian fancies about self-realization. Regrettably, this\nideological reconstruction of new liberals like Green and Bosanquet\ncontinues largely unabated (see Skinner, 2002: 16). But as our\nideological sensitivities shift, we can now begin rereading them with\nchanged prejudice, if not less prejudice. And the same goes for how we\ncan now reread other marginalized, nineteenth-century English liberals\nlike Spencer. As the shadow of European totalitarianism wanes, the\nlens through which we do intellectual history changes and we can more\neasily read our Spencer as he intended to be read, namely as a\nutilitarian who wanted to be a liberal just as much.\n\nLike J. S. Mill, Spencer struggled to make utilitarianism\nauthentically liberal by infusing it with a demanding principle of\nliberty and robust moral rights. He was convinced, like Mill, that\nutilitarianism could accommodate rights with independent moral force\nand yet remain genuinely consequentialist. Subtly construed,\nutilitarianism can effectively mimick the very best deontological\nliberalism.\n",
