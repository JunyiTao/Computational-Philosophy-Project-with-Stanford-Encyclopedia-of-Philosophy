    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe relationship between logic and psychology was fought over most\nintensely in the German-speaking lands between 1890 and 1914. Indeed,\nduring this period pretty much all of German-speaking philosophy was\nengulfed in the so-called Psychologismus-Streit (the\n\u2018psychologism dispute\u2019). This dispute centered on the\nquestion whether logic (and epistemology) are parts of psychology.\nGottlob Frege and Edmund Husserl are the best-known figures of this\ncontroversy. The fact that the psychologism dispute has become closely\nassociated with German-speaking philosophy must not, however, blind us\nto the enormous influence of John Stuart Mill upon both sides of the\ncontroversy. Paradoxically, Mill\u2019s Logic of 1843 was\nnot only a key inspiration behind much German-speaking psychologistic\nphilosophy, it also contained some crucially important\nanti-psychologistic ideas.\n\nIn what follows, I shall begin with a short summary of Mill\u2019s\ncontribution. Subsequently, and turning to the German scene, I shall\nbriefly sketch what authors accused of psychologism said on the\nrelationship between logic and psychology, before outlining\nFrege\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s arguments against them. I shall\nconclude by presenting a number of objections to Frege\u2019s and\nHusserl\u2019s anti-psychologism. Some of these objections come from\nFrege\u2019s and Husserl\u2019s contemporaries, others are of more\nrecent origin.\n\n(Important papers on the emergence of psychologism in\nnineteenth-century German philosophy are George 1997, Peckhaus 2006\nand Stelzner 2005. The most important monograph is Beiser 2014. Gray\n2008 contains many important observations on early psychologistic\ntendencies in mathematics and logic.) \n",
