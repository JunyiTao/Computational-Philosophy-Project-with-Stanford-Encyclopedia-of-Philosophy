Schr\u00f6der\u2019s systematization of the algebra of logic\n\nThe German mathematician Ernst Schr\u00f6der played a key role in the\ntradition of the algebra of logic. A good example was his challenge to\nPeirce to provide a proof of the distributive law, as one of the key\nequational properties of the algebras with two binary operations.\nPeirce (1885) admitted that he could not provide a proof. Years later\nHuntington (1904: 300\u2013301) described part of the content of a\nletter he had received from Peirce in December 1903 that claimed to\nprovide the missing proof\u2014evidently Peirce had stumbled across\nthe long lost pages after the death of Schr\u00f6der in 1902. Peirce\nexplained to Huntington that he had originally assumed Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\nchallenge was well-founded and that this apparent shortcoming of his\npaper \u201cwas to be added to the list of blunders, due to the\ngrippe, with which that paper abounds, \u2026\u201d. Actually\nPeirce\u2019s proof did not correct the error since the distributive law\ndoes not hold in lattices in general; instead his proof brought in the\noperation of complementation\u2014he used the axiom\n\n\nif \\(a\\) is not contained in the complement of \\(b\\) then \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) have a common lower bound.\n\n\nOn the basis of his previous algebraic work, Schr\u00f6der wrote an\nencyclopedic three volume work at the end of the 19th\ncentury called Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131905), built on the subsumption framework with the modern\nsemantics of classes as presented by Peirce. This work was the result\nof his research in algebra and revealed different influences.\nSchr\u00f6der aimed at a general algebraic theory with applications in\nmany mathematical fields, where the algebra of logic was at the core.\nAs Geraldine Brady pointed out, it offers the first exposition of\nabstract lattice theory, the first exposition of Dedekind\u2019s theory of\nchains after Dedekind, the most comprehensive development of the\ncalculus of relations, and a treatment of the foundations of\nmathematics on the basis of the relation calculus (see Brady 2000: 143\nf.)\n\nThe first volume concerned the equational logic of classes, the main\nresult being Boole\u2019s Elimination Theorem of 1854. Three rather\ncomplicated counter-examples to Peirce\u2019s claim of distributivity\nappeared in an appendix to Vol. I, one of which involved nine-hundred\nand ninety identities for quasigroups. On the basis of this volume,\nDedekind (1897) composed an elegant modern abstract presentation of\nlattices (which he called Dualgruppen); in this paper he\npresented a five-element counter-example to Peirce\u2019s claim of the\ndistributive law.\n\nVolume II augments the algebra of logic for classes developed in\nVolume I so that it can handle existential statements. First, using\nmodern semantics, Schr\u00f6der proved that one cannot use equations\nto express \u201cSome \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\u201d. However, he noted that\none can easily express it with a negated equation, namely \\(XY \\ne\n0\\). Volume II, a study of the calculus of classes using both\nequations and negated equations, attempted to cover the same topics\ncovered in Vol. I, in particular there was considerable effort devoted\nto finding an Elimination Theorem. After dealing with several special\ncases, Schr\u00f6der recommended this topic as an important research\narea\u2014the quest for an Elimination Theorem would be known as the\nElimination Problem.\n\nInspired mainly by Peirce\u2019s work, Schr\u00f6der examined the algebra\nof logic for binary relations in Vol. III of his Vorlesungen\n\u00fcber die Algebra der Logik. As Tarski once noted, Peirce\u2019s\nwork was continued and extended in a very thorough and systematic way\nby Schr\u00f6der. One item of particular fascination for him was this:\ngiven an equation \\(E(x, y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\) in this algebra, find the\ngeneral solution for one of the relation symbols, say for \\(x\\), in\nterms of the other relation symbols. He managed, given a particular\nsolution \\(x = x0\\), to find a remarkable term \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\)\nwith the following properties: (1) \\(x = S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) yields a\nsolution to \\(E = 0\\) for any choice of relation \\(t\\), and (2) every\nsolution \\(x\\) of \\(E = 0\\) can be obtained in this manner by choosing\na suitable \\(t\\). Peirce was not impressed by Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\npreoccupation with the problem of solving equations, and pointed out\nthat Schr\u00f6der\u2019s parametric solution was a bit of a hoax\u2014the\nexpressive power of the algebra of logic for relations was so strong\nthat by evaluating the term \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) one essentially\ncarried out the steps to check if \\(E(t, y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\); if the\nanswer was yes then \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) returned the value \\(t\\),\notherwise it would return the value \\(x0\\).\n\nSumming up, Schr\u00f6der constructed an algebraic version of modern\npredicate logic and also a theory of relations. He applied it to\ndifferent fields (e.g., Cantor\u2019s set theory), and he considered his\nalgebraic notation as a general or universal language\n(pasigraphy, see Peckhaus 2004 and Legris 2012). It is to be\nnoted that L\u00f6wenheim in 1940 still thought it was as reasonable\nas set theory. According to him, Schr\u00f6der\u2019s idea of solving a\nrelational equation was a precursor of Skolem functions, and\nSchr\u00f6der inspired L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s formulation and proof of the\nfamous theorem that every \u201carithmetical\u201d sentence with an\ninfinite model has a countable model. Schr\u00f6der\u2019s calculus of\nrelations was the basis for the doctoral dissertation of Norbert\nWiener (1894\u20131964) in Harvard (Wiener 1913). According to Brady,\nWiener gave the first axiomatic treatment of the calculus of\nrelations, preceding Tarski\u2019s axiomatization by more than twenty years\n(see Brady 2000: 165).\n",
