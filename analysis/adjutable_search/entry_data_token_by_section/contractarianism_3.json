Critiques of Normative Contractarianism\n\nMany critiques have been leveled against particular contractarian\ntheories and against contractarianism as a framework for normative\nthought about justice or morality. (See the entry on\n contemporary approaches to the social contract.)\n Jean Hampton criticized Hobbes in her book Hobbes and the Social\nContract Tradition, in a way that has direct relevance to\ncontemporary contractarianism. Hampton argues that the\ncharacterization of individuals in the state of nature leads to a\ndilemma. Hobbes\u2019 state of nature as a potential war of all against all\ncan be generated either as a result of passions (greed and fear, in\nparticular) or rationality (prisoner\u2019s dilemma reasoning, in which the\nrational players each choose to renege on agreements made with each\nother). But if the passions account is correct, then contractors will\nstill be motivated by these passions after the social contract is\ndrawn up, and so will fail to comply with it (Hampton 1986). And if\nthe rationality account is correct, then rational actors will not\ncomply with the social contract any more than they will cooperate with\neach other before it is made.\n\nThis critique has an analog for theories (such as Gauthier\u2019s) that\nclaim that without the contract individuals will be stuck in some\nsocial sub-optimal situation that is bad enough to motivate them to\nmake concessions to each other for some agreement, yet the reason for\ntheir inability to cooperate without the contract cannot continue to\noperate after the contract is made. A potential solution to this\nproblem is to argue that individuals will choose to dispose themselves\nto be constrained (self-interest) maximizers rather than\nstraightforward (self-interest) maximizers, that is, to retrain\nthemselves not to think first of their self-interest but rather to\ndispose themselves to keep their agreements, provided that they find\nthemselves in an environment of like-minded individuals (Gauthier\n1986, 160\u2013166). But this solution has been found dubitable by\nmany commentators (see Vallentyne 1991).\n\nHampton also objects to the contemporary contractarian assumption that\ninteraction is merely instrumentally valuable. She argues that if\ninteraction were only valuable for the fruits of cooperation that it\nbears for self-interested cooperators, then it would be unlikely that\nthose cooperators could successfully solve the compliance problem. In\nshort, they are likely not to be able to motivate morality in\nthemselves without some natural inclination to morality.\nInterestingly, Hampton agrees with Gauthier that contractarianism is\nright to require any moral or political norms to appeal to individuals\u2019\nself-interest as a limitation on self-sacrifice or exploitation of any\nindividual.\n\nTwo further critiques can be raised against contractarianism\n(Southwood 2010). According to the normativity objection,\ncontractarian morality is not sufficiently other-regarding because it\nmotivates morality by appeal to one\u2019s self-interest rather than any\nconcern of others. Because of this, the theory gives one no reason to\nfeel guilt or remorse for wrongdoing, but rather, at most,\nself-directed anger or disappointment at acting irrationally.\nSouthwood\u2019s objection can be seen as one way of filling out Superson\u2019s\nclaim, mentioned above, that Gauthier\u2019s theory cannot respond to the\nmotive skeptic. This objection overlooks the fact that some appeal to\nothers\u2019 concerns is built into both the Lockean Proviso and the\nbargaining theory from which the content of the moral norms are\nderived. Furthermore, Kantian moral theory would seem to be subject to\nthe same objection insofar as it appeals to autonomous rationality as\nthe motive for acting morally. Gauthier can be seen as providing a\nresponse to the objection in the final chapter of Morals by\nAgreement, where he describes the \u201cliberal\nindividual,\u201d whose moral psychology is shaped by living the\nmoral life that mutual advantage contractarianism prescribes. \n\nAccording to the impartiality objection, all human persons are owed\ncertain duties regardless of their powers or abilities, and because it\nrelies on an instrumental and subjective conception of practical\nreason, contractarianism cannot explain how this would be\nso. Contractarianism, on the contrary, holds it to be irrational to\ntreat truly powerless persons equally, since it is not mutually\nadvantageous to do so. This problem, which is similar to the exclusion\nproblem discussed above and in section 6 below, is a serious problem.\nGauthier\u2019s Lockean Proviso was meant to rule out taking historical\npatterns of dominance into account, but even if all such dominance\nrelations were eliminated and bargaining were conditioned on\nundominated assets, the inequality in natural talents and abilities\nwould reintroduce the possibility of dominance.\n\nContractarianism has also been criticized on racial grounds (Williams\n1991). Contracts require independent agents who are able to make and\ncarry out promises without the aid of others. Historically, while\nwhite men have been treated as these pure wills of contract theory,\nBlacks and women have been treated as anti-will: dependent and\nirrational. Both ideals are false; whole people, she says, are\ndependent on other whole people. But by defining some as contractors\nand others as incapable of contract, whole classes of people can be\nexcluded from the realm of justice. This point has been explored by\nother critics of contractarianism, first by Allen Buchanan (1993) and\nmore recently by Eva Kittay (1999), who points out that not only are\ndependents such as children and disabled people left out of\nconsideration by contractarian theories, but their caretakers\u2019 needs\nand interests will tend to be underestimated in the contract, as\nwell.\n",
