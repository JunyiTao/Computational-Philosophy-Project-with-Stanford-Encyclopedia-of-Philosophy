Why does Leibniz reject Physical Influx?\n\nLeibniz wants to rule out any kind of causation in which one substance\npasses something on to the other substance: \u201cThe way of\ninfluence belongs to that of the common philosophy. However, since it\nis impossible to conceive of material particles or of species or\nimmaterial qualities that can pass from one of these substances into\nthe other, the view must be rejected\u201d (GP iv, 498f). Early in\nhis career, Leibniz dismisses the physical influx theory of the\nScholastic Francisco Suarez as a \u201cbarbaric expression \u2026\nmetaphorical and more obscure than what it defines\u201d (Preface to\nan Edition of Nizolius GP iv, 150). (Whether Suarez actually held the\nview Leibniz ascribes to him is another matter entirely.) Moreover,\nthe pre-established harmony can achieve the same effect without the\nmetaphysical baggage of \u201cproperty passing\u201d: \u201cSo\nthere will be a perfect accord between all these substances which\nproduces the same effect that would be noticed if they all\ncommunicated with each other by a transmission of species or of\nqualities, as the common run of philosophers imagine\u201d (New\nSystem GP iv, 484/L 457f).\n\nIt is fairly clear here that Leibniz takes \u2018influx\u2019 to\nrefer to the transference of accidents\u2014today we call them tropes\nor property-instances\u2014as when a guitarist\u2019s fingers give\nan instance of motion to a struck guitar string. Leibniz holds that it\ncannot be comprehended how one finite substance could act on another\nfinite substance. For such intersubstantial causation entails the\ntransference or migration of an accident from one substance to\nanother, where a trope passes from one thing to another, which then\ninstantiates it. Such transference is inexplicable; an accident\npassing (i.e., trope transferring) from one subject to another is\nimpossible (New Essays A vi, 6, 224). Leibniz writes in the\nDiscourse on Metaphysics:\n\n\u2026 nothing ever enters into our mind naturally from the outside;\nand we have a bad habit of thinking of our soul as if it received\ncertain species as messengers and as if it has doors and windows. We\nhave all these forms in our mind; we even have forms from all time,\nfor the mind always expresses all its future thoughts and already\nthinks confusedly about everything it will ever think about\ndistinctly. (Discourse on Metaphysics \u00a726 GP iv, 451/AG\n58)\n\n\nAnd he writes almost three decades later: \u201cMonads have no\nwindows, through which anything could come in or go out. And accidents\ncannot detach themselves and stroll about outside of substances, as\nthe Scholastics\u2019 sensible species used to; so neither substance\nnor accident can come into a monad from outside\u201d\n(Monadology \u00a77 GP vi, 608/WF 268).\n\nLeibniz also argues in this way: If the mind (one finite substance)\nwere to act on the body (another finite substance) thereby causing\nbodily motion, there would be an increase in motion in that region of\nthe world after the mind\u2019s action on the body not compensated\nfor by a decrease in motion in another region. This is an obvious\nviolation of the law of the conservation of motion. Therefore, there\nis no physical influx. The Monadology includes the following\npassage:\n\nDescartes recognized that souls cannot impart a force to bodies\nbecause there is always the same quantity of force in matter [i.e.,\nthe material world]. However, he thought that the soul could change\nthe direction of [force in] bodies. But that is because the law of\nnature, which also affirms the conservation of the same total\ndirection in matter, was not known at that time. If he had known it,\nhe would have hit upon my system of pre-established harmony.\n(Monadology \u00a780 GP vi, 620f/AG 223)\n\n\nPart of what troubles Leibniz about the doctrine of physical influx is\nthat in acting, the cause is drained. According to Leibniz, real\ncausation entails that the cause not lose any of its efficacy after\nexercising its causal power. Leibniz depicts the production of our\nthoughts, for instance, as involving emanative causation: \u201cit is\nvery evident that created substances depend upon God, who preserves\nthem and who even produces them continually by a kind of emanation,\njust as we produce our thoughts\u201d (Discourse on\nMetaphysics \u00a714 GP iv, 439/AG 46). Other commentators have\nput it this way: \u201c[S]ubstances are to be understood as enjoying\na lawful primitive force of action whereby accidents emanate from the\nsubstance, from within\u201d (Cover & O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne,\n181).\n\nIt is hard to tell why Leibniz is troubled by any theory that involves\nthe potential loss of causal efficacy in substances. Part of it might\nhave to do with his belief that even finite, created substances are\nnaturally indestructible (i.e., immortal) (Principles of Nature\nand Grace \u00a72 GP vi, 598/P 195). For then created, finite\nsubstances, continually acting according to the physical influx model,\nmight eventually lose their causal efficacy and would no longer be\nable to act. And for Leibniz, \u201csubstances cannot be conceived in\ntheir bare essence, devoid of activity; that activity is of the\nessence of substance in general\u201d (New Essays A vi, 6,\n65). So, physical influx would entail the natural mortality of\nsubstance, a view that Leibniz wholly rejects.\n\nConsider another expression of Leibniz\u2019s anti-influx\nposition:\n\nNo created substance exerts a metaphysical action or influence on\nanother, for to say nothing of the fact that it cannot be explained\nhow anything can pass over from one thing into the substance of\nanother, it has already been shown that all the futures of each thing\nfollow from its own concept. What we call causes are in metaphysical\nrigor only concomitant requisites. (Primary Truths C 521/L\n269/AG 33)\n\n\nNow, the idea here of causes as concomitant requisites and of God\n\u201cpreserving\u201d substances continually by a kind of emanation\nmay suggest occasionalism, but it is clear that Leibniz, after\ninitially showing some sympathy toward occasionalism, eventually\nrejects it.\n",
