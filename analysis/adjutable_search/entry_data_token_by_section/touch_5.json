    "main_text": "Touch and Bodily Awareness\n6. Touch and Bodily Awareness\nThe sense of touch is closely connected to bodily awareness. This\nconnection is seemingly much stronger than what we find in the other\nsenses (though this is somewhat controversial, as we\u2019ll see).\nThis close connection is easy to understand. Whenever we touch, and\nespecially when we engage in active or haptic touch, we are\nforced to use our bodies. Setting aside the worries discussed above\nabout defining the organ of touch, there is some truth to the claim\nthat we touch with our whole body. After all, we touch using our skin,\nmuscles, joints, and we can touch using nearly every surface along the\nwhole body.[2]\nArmstrong\u2019s view, discussed above, suggested that touch was\nalways a felt relation between our bodies and some objective feature\nconnected directly to us.\nOne possibility is that the sense of touch, while distinct from\nproprioception, nevertheless always involves it (O\u2019Shaughnessy\n1998, 2000; Ratcliffe 2008). Since proprioception is nothing other\nthan awareness of the location and orientation of our own bodies,\nthere is a strong sense in which touch nearly always involves\nawareness of the body. Citing groundbreaking work on the relation\nbetween tactual and bodily awareness by Merleau-Ponty (2002), Gibson\n(1966), and Martin (1992), Ratcliffe (2012) offers a detailed overview\nof the ways in which touch seems to bring both an awareness of things\nexternal to the body and of the body itself.  The body is that by\nwhich we measure the features of things in the external world, and so\nis always present in our awareness of things through touch. There are\nmany reasons for thinking of this connection as relatively weak. There\nare plausible examples, like playing sports or quickly touching\nobjects, where we seem to have external awareness through touch but no\ndirect bodily awareness (Scott\n2001).[3]\nMattens (2017) has argued that philosophers have typically focused too\nmuch on external objects and object perception in their work on touch. The fine-grained\nmanipulation and exploration of objects with human hands is not, according\nto Mattens, the best way to think about touch. Instead, tactile awareness serves \nprimarily as a kind of protective signaling system that warns about incoming threats (cf. the Bodyguard Hypothesis defended by De Vignemont 2018).\nOn this view, touch is primarily about bodily awareness, about what is happening with\nand to our bodies, and only derivatively about the nature of external object.\n Another possibility is that, while touch indeed involves bodily\nawareness, the nature and structure of this awareness is importantly\ndifferent from what we see in typical cases of mediated\nperception. Touch does not involve awareness of the body as a part of\nsome external feature (as in other cases of mediated perception) nor\ndoes it involve any explicit cognitive attitude. Instead, it could be\nthat some bodily sensation is necessary for tactual perception\n(Richardson 2011). This view has the advantage both explaining why\ntouch necessarily involves bodily awareness but also why it differs\nfrom more typical cases of mediated perception. In particular, it\ndiffers from the template view by dropping any requirement for a\nmatching of spatial or other contents between the tactual perception\nand the bodily awareness. For this reason, it more easily accommodates\nextended touch.\nExtended touch, or awareness of distal objects and features through\na cane or other tool, can be used to argue for a related but distinct\nview of the relation between perceptual touch and bodily awareness\n(Fulkerson 2012). That we experience through touch objects and\nfeatures located some distance from the body raises questions about\nthe mediating role of bodily awareness. Given the nature of extended\ntouch, it seems implausible to hold that there is anything like a\nmatching of the contents of perceptual touch (or the features made\navailable through touch) with the content or features involved in the\nbodily awareness. Instead, perceptual touch seems to depend on bodily\nawareness informationally. The idea is that both bodily\nawareness (proprioception and kinesthesis especially) and\ndiscriminative touch make use of the very same sensory\ninputs. Perceptual touch is the result of extracting distal\ninformation from the more proximal bodily information, for use by\ndedicated downstream systems (cf. Serino and Haggard 2010). Since all\nperceptual touch will be the result of such extraction, there will\nalways be bodily information available for awareness.\nThese various views all take a stand on the extent to which touch\nbrings direct awareness of external features and objects, and to what\nextent such awareness is mediated by awareness of the body. In\naddition, they are usually forced to take a stand on the spatial\ncontents of perceptual touch. On views according to which all external\ntactual awareness is ultimately a form of bodily awareness, it is\nsimply not possible to have extended touch experiences. On other views\nthat hold a less restrictive dependence between perceptual touch and\nbodily awareness, there is an additional burden to explain how distal\ntouch is possible. These choices have analogues in the empirical\nliterature. Some, for instance, want to make a clear distinction\nbetween \u201cinteroception\u201d and \u201cexteroception\u201d\n (Craig 2002). According to this view, many aspects of touch,\nthough primarily its thermal properties and most forms of pure bodily\nsensation (itch, tingles, twinges, etc.) are primarily directed not at\nthe external world, but at the present state of our bodies. This is\npart of how our bodies maintain homeostasis. This results in\nthe possibility of very different functional roles for certain aspects\nof bodily awareness, especially as they function in the generation of\nperceptual touch.\n",
