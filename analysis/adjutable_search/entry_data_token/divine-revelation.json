Conceptions of Divine Revelation\n\nRevelation, as commonly understood, has to do with the dispelling of\nignorance. The counterpart of \u201cthe revealed\u201d, therefore,\nis \u201cthe hidden\u201d (Wolterstorff 1995: 23). However, the term\nhas many meanings or uses\u2014religious as well as\nnon-religious\u2014which are related to each other analogically. A\ndistinction should be made, first, between the process and product\nmeaning of the word. \u201cRevelation\u201d can either refer to the\nact/process of revealing something, or to the content that is\nrevealed. Second, while in ordinary discourse one can \u201chave a\nrevelation\u201d without there being a revealer (an agent that\nreveals), in religious contexts revelation is usually understood as a\n\u201cperson-to-person affair\u201d (Helm 1982: 14; Mavrodes 1988:\n96).\n\nThe following scheme (S) identifies the elements that are necessary\nfor a revelatory claim (a claim that a revelation has occurred) to be\ntrue:\n\n(S)\n m reveals a to n by means of (through, etc.)\nk (Mavrodes 1988: 88).\n\n\nIn addition to a revealer (m) and an audience (n), an\nact of revelation must have a content (a) that is made known or\navailable to the audience through some means (k). Given this\nscheme, several areas of controversy can be pin-pointed. Since the\ntopic is divine revelation, m is of course identified with God.\nHowever, in contemporary Christian thought, there is a debate about\nthe nature of a. Is the content of divine revelation\npropositions about or related to God, or is it God himself, or both\n(O\u2018Collins 2016a: Ch. 1)? Many theologians emphasize that God\nreveals himself rather than propositions or\n\u201cinformation\u201d. This debate (to which we will return) must\nbe understood against the background of the Christian doctrine of the\nincarnation, which claims that God \u201cbecame flesh and lived among\nus\u201d (John 1: 14).\n\nFurthermore, there is a debate about whether n\u2014the\naudience\u2014includes only those who have actually acquired\nknowledge through the revelation, or if n can also include\nthose who potentially could have acquired such knowledge, but\nin fact did not. In other words, is revelation a \u201csuccess\nword\u201d or does it cover cases where knowledge is merely made\navailable? (For different views, see Sluys 2000; Blaauw 2009; Gunton\n1995: 113; O\u2019Collins 2016a: 76).\n1.1 General/Natural and Special Revelation\n\nA common distinction that relates to the audience (n) is\nbetween general and special (or particular)\nrevelation, where the former refers to a revelation that is\nuniversally available, and the latter to a revelation made (directly\nor initially) to a limited group of people. Often, general revelation\nis identified with natural revelation, even though the latter\nconcept has to do with the means of revelation (k) rather than\nthe audience. The natural world, including human nature, is available\nto all, and would be the most plausible candidate as a means for a\ngeneral revelation. However, it is conceivable that God could have\nmade a general revelation by acting outside of the natural order, for\nexample by making miracles visible to all (Helm 1982: 17). Strictly\nspeaking, therefore, the counterpart to natural revelation\u2014if\nthere is a counterpart\u2014is supernatural revelation\nrather than special revelation. \u201cSupernatural\u201d, in a\ntheological context, refers to putative divine action that is not\nincluded in God\u2019s ordinary activity of creating and sustaining\nthe world. For the most part, however, \u201cgeneral\nrevelation\u201d and \u201cnatural revelation\u201d are used\ninterchangeably, as are their counterparts \u201cspecial\nrevelation\u201d and \u201csupernatural revelation\u201d (for\ncriticism of the distinction, see Downing 1964).\n\nSome philosophers make a distinction between natural revelation and\nnatural theology (e.g., King 2012; Helm 1982: 22\u201326;\nWolterstorff 1995: 24\u201325). According to Helm, for something to\nqualify as divine revelation it must be immediate, and the human\nrecipients must be passive. Since natural theology includes the\nactivity of inferring knowledge of God from publicly available\nevidence, natural theology is not a species of natural revelation,\nHelm argues. It is unclear, however, why God could not reveal himself\nin a way that requires inferential activity on the part of the\nrecipients, and many thinkers make no distinction between natural\nrevelation and natural theology (Davies 2009: 36; O\u2019Collins\n2016b: 287). In the context of this entry, however, it is necessary to\nexclude traditional natural theology from treatment, and\n\u201cnatural revelation\u201d will therefore be understood in\naccordance with Helm\u2019s restrictive definition. The major focus,\nhowever, will be on special\n revelation.[3]\n\nThe very idea of special revelation has often been viewed with\nsuspicion since the Enlightenment (Abraham 2002). Why is not natural\nrevelation enough? Why would God in addition need to reveal himself to\ncertain people at certain points in history? A related critique takes\nissue with divine hiddenness. If God exists, why does he seem to be\n\u201chidden\u201d, so that a revelation is necessary in the first\nplace? Since objections of this kind concern the coherence of\nreligious outlooks based on a purported \u201cspecial\u201d\nrevelation, it is reasonable for defenders of revelation to appeal to\nthe doctrines of their own religious tradition. Christian thinkers\nhave traditionally explained divine hiddenness and the need for\nspecial revelation with reference to humanity\u2019s fall into sin.\nSin has cognitive effects, and revelation is typically seen as the\nepistemic aspect of salvation (O\u2018Collins 2011: 70\u201374).\nWhen God acts in history to save humanity, he reveals himself and what\nhe is doing. Nevertheless, as a result of the Enlightenment critique,\nnineteenth century theologians started to downplay special revelation.\nInstead, they emphasized what could be ascertained about God on the\nbasis of \n\n\nrational argument, historical enquiry, analysis of the structures of\nhuman perception or moral motivation, or any combination of these.\n(Quash 2007: 328) \n\n\nThis \u201creduction\u201d of special revelation to a vague form of\ngeneral revelation, however, generated a counter-reaction in the\ntwentieth century by theologians such as Karl Barth, who emphasized a\nunique divine revelation in Christ.\n\nWhen it comes to the means (k) of revelation, philosophical\nreflection can either consider a priori possibilities for how\nrevelation might proceed, or study ideas and claims about revelation\nfound in a particular religious tradition, such as Christianity.\nPerhaps it is most fruitful to combine analysis of religious claims\nwith conceptual or metaphysical reflection in order to map the\npossible means of divine revelation. Using this kind of method,\nWilliam Abraham has described revelation as a \u201cpolymorphous\nconcept\u201d like \u201cteach\u201d and \u201cfarm\u201d\n(Abraham 1997: 206). Just like one can teach by doing a variety of\ndifferent concrete things (lecturing, using pictures or models,\ngrading papers, etc.), so God could reveal by doing many different\nthings, such as speaking, doing \u201cmight acts\u201d in history,\ncausing dreams, visions or other experiences, or \u201cmaking Himself\npresent and manifesting Himself\u201d by means of an incarnation\n(Vatican II, Dei Verbum \u00a7 4).\n1.2 Manifestational and Propositional Revelation\n\nA useful distinction related to the means of revelation (k) is\nbetween manifestational and non-manifestational\nrevelation (Wolterstorff 1995: 26). Manifestational revelation happens\nwhen somebody \u201cshows\u201d or in some other way makes some\nreality manifest, while non-manifestational revelation takes place\nwhen something is revealed without being shown or manifested\u2014for\nexample, by means of verbal communication. According to Wolterstorff,\nthe essential difference between these two ways of revealing is that\nin the case of manifestational revelation, the means of revelation is\na natural sign of the reality revealed (such as the reality itself, or\na characteristic causal effect of it). In the case of\nnon-manifestational revelation, the means is not a natural sign.\nInstead it can be conventional sign (e.g., a sentence), or some other\nentity, such as a belief implanted in somebody\u2019s mind by God.\n\n\nMavrodes has subdivided non-manifestational varieties of revelation\ninto two categories which he calls \u201cthe communication\nmodel\u201d and \u201cthe causation model\u201d (in addition to\nthese, he suggests a \u201cmanifestation model\u201d). In the\ncommunication model, revelation is understood as something analogous\nto speech and related linguistic activities. In the causation model,\nrevelation happens by God causing beliefs in people, either from the\nbeginning of a person\u2019s existence, or at some later time\n(Mavrodes 1988: 73\u201374).\n\nA concept that has figured importantly in debates about the means of\nrevelation is \u201cpropositional revelation\u201d. Wolterstorff\nclaims that this is just another name for non-manifestational\nrevelation. Since propositions are an essential part of the\nmeans (k) of non-manifestational revelations (as we will see),\nthere seems to be good reason for this identification. However, in\ntwentieth century theology, \u201cpropositional revelation\u201d has\nreceived something of a bad reputation. A typical criticism is\nexpressed by Hordern: \u201cWhat God reveals is not propositions or\ninformation\u2014what God reveals is God\u201d (Hordern 1959:\n61\u201362; see also Baillie 1956: 28; Kelsey 1975: 32; Schw\u00f6bel\n1990: 34; Williams 2000: 131). In modern theology,\n\u201cpropositional\u201d accounts of revelation are often said to\nhave given way to a focus on divine \u201cself-revelation\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe locus of revelation is not propositions but events, and its\ncontent is not a body of truths about God, but \u201cthe living\nGod\u201d revealing himself in his actions toward man. (Hick 1967:\n190)\n\n\nIn order to address this debate about the role of propositions in\nrevelation, and to assess the theological critique, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between two questions:\n\nHow do propositions figure in the means of revelation\n(k)?\nHow do propositions figure in the content of revelation\n(a)?\n\n\nThere is no consensus about the nature or even existence of\npropositions, but most philosophers would agree that propositions (if\nthey exist) can be true or false, and that they are\n\u201csharable\u201d. Many people can believe the same proposition\nat the same time, and many different sentences can express the same\nproposition (e.g., \u201cSchnee is Weiss\u201d and \u201cSnow is\nwhite\u201d). Assuming this view, there are at least two ways in\nwhich propositions could figure in the means (k) of revelation.\nFirst, if God speaks\u2014in a literal sense of \u201cspeaks\u201d,\nthat is, if he uses sentences to communicate\u2014then\nsentences would be the primary means of revelation. However,\nif propositions constitute the meaning of sentences, then\npropositions would figure importantly as well. Second, suppose that\nGod does not speak in this literal sense, but instead directly causes\ncertain people to have certain beliefs. In that case, the beliefs that\nGod causes would be the primary means of revelation. However, since\npropositions constitute the cognitive contents of beliefs,\npropositions would figure importantly too.\n\nIn manifestational revelation, the means is\n(paradigmatically) a direct presentation or manifestation of the very\nreality that God wishes to reveal\u2014for example himself.\nIn this kind of \u201cmeans\u201d, propositions are not involved.\nGod is not a proposition, obviously, and neither does God have a\nproposition as his \u201ccontent\u201d. Hence, a central difference\nbetween manifestational and propositional (non-manifestational)\nrevelation seems to be, unsurprisingly, that propositions figure\nimportantly in the means of the latter, but not in the means of the\nformer.\n\nHowever, and perhaps more surprisingly, when it comes to the\ncontent of revelation, the same does not seem to be true.\nPropositions must, arguably, figure as part of the content of\nmanifestational revelations as well as in the content of propositional\nrevelation. We can see this by the following example. Suppose a person\nreveals an object manifestationally by showing it to someone. This\nwill not only reveal the object itself, but also some propositions\nabout it. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the act could count as a\nrevelation. Since revelation is an epistemic concept (or at\nleast has an epistemic dimension), any act of revelation must make\nsomething known or knowable, and this means making at least some\nproposition known or knowable (Wahlberg 2014:\n30\u201331).\n\nIn response, it can be argued that there is such a thing as\n\u201cknowledge by acquaintance\u201d that is not reducible to\npropositional knowledge. Or perhaps knowing a person is\nirreducible to knowing about that person (see, e.g., Stump\n2010: Ch. 3\u20134).\nEven so, it is difficult to see how one could get\nacquaintance-knowledge or \u201cpersonal\u201d knowledge of a person\n(or of God) without also having a good deal of propositional knowledge\nabout him. For example, how could one know somebody by acquaintance\nwithout at the same time knowing that this person exists\n(which is a piece of propositional knowledge)? (Wellington 2019: 166;\nLamont 2004: 7\u20138).\n\nThis reasoning will not convince those who deny the existence of\npropositions (see, e.g., Westphal 1999 for an anti-realist critique).\nHowever, among those who accept propositions, many have taken the\ncontrast that Hordern and others draw between revelation of\npropositions and divine self-revelation to be\nmisconceived. God could not reveal himself without simultaneously\nrevealing (making knowable) some propositions about himself.\nPropositions must figure in the content (a) of both\npropositional and manifestational revelations. In manifestational\nrevelations, however, they do not figure as means\n(k).\n\nAnother important difference between propositional and manifestational\nrevelation concerns the need for interpretation. In manifestational\nrevelation, the audience is confronted with \u201craw\nreality\u201d\u2014for example \u201cGod himself\u201d, or some\nspectacular historical event. Such media of revelation contain a\nwealth of information, and it is up to the recipient to decide which\naspects of the manifestation to focus on. In propositional revelation,\non the other hand, the audience is confronted with entities such as\nwords and sentences that are specially designed to express a\ndeterminate message. Something similar is presumably true in cases of\ndivine direct communication of knowledge to a person\u2019s mind.\nHence, even though interpretation is involved in the reception of both\npropositional and manifestational revelation, in the case of\npropositional revelation, less of it is needed (Wolterstorff 1995:\n29). Arguably, it follows from this that if God wants to convey a\nfairly determinate cognitive content, he will have good reason to use\nsome form of propositional revelation (perhaps in addition to\nmanifestational revelation) (Mansini 2018: 260).\n\nWhy, then, are some theologians critical of propositional revelation?\nWhile here are different kinds of critique (Helm 1972; Gunton 1995:\n7\u201313), the main objection has to do with how the notion of\npropositional revelation is thought to affect biblical interpretation.\nStandardly, the critics\u2019 argument (made from a Christian\nperspective) goes something like this:\n\n If there is such a thing as propositional\nrevelation, it is found in the Bible.\n If there is propositional revelation in the Bible,\nthen it is communicated through literal language that\nstraightforwardly expresses divinely revealed propositions (Dulles\n1992: 48).\n However, it is very implausible that God\ncommunicates in this way, since the Bible often uses metaphor and\nnarrative rather than literal language. Moreover, the Bible contains\nerroneous and problematic claims and views, and historical-critical\nscholarship has shown that the text is shaped by the contingent\nhistorical, cultural and political contexts of the human authors\n(Dulles 1992: 49).\n Hence, the Bible does not contain propositional revelation.\n Hence, there is no propositional revelation.\n\n\nAn \u201ceasy\u201d response to this argument points out that it\nassumes that either the whole Bible constitutes propositional\nrevelation, or else there is no propositional revelation in the Bible\nat all. However, it is possible that\nparts of the Bible record propositional revelations\nthat were originally given to prophets, apostles and others. Moreover, some\noriginal divine communications of this kind might not even be recorded\nin the Bible but instead preserved and interpreted through an oral\ntradition, as traditional Catholic and Orthodox perspectives hold\n(however, see Ratzinger 1966: 46).\n\nMany defenders of propositional revelation believe that this\n\u201ceasy\u201d response concedes too much ground to the critics.\nThey argue that the Bible as a whole can reasonably be believed to be\n\u201cauthored\u201d by God and expressive of propositional\nrevelation. Attacking\n premise 2,\n the defenders of divine authorship point out that propositions can be\nexpressed by metaphorical and other non-literal forms of language. A\npropositional construal of biblical revelation does not mean that a\nnarrowly literalistic approach to the Bible is necessary (Lamont 2004:\nCh. 5; Wolterstorff 1995: Ch. 11\u201312; McCall 2009). Attacking\n premise 3,\n they furthermore argue that divine authorship is compatible with the\ntext being shaped by the cultural and personal perspectives of the\nhuman authors. God could, for example, author the Bible by\n\u201cappropriating\u201d or \u201cauthorizing\u201d human\ndiscourse, thereby making human utterances or speech-acts into\nvehicles of his own discourse. In a similar way as a president can\nauthorize an ambassador to speak on her behalf, or a speaker can\nappropriate the utterances of others by quotation or paraphrase, so\nGod could \u201cborrow\u201d human speech-acts without depriving the\nhuman authors of genuine authorship (Wolterstorff 1995: Ch. 3. For\ncriticism, see Wisse 2002; Levine 1998). If this is what God has done,\nthen biblical interpretation will require that we distinguish between\nthe intentions and message of the human authors, and the intention and\nmessage of the divine, appropriating discourse. The former may contain\nerroneous or morally problematic views, which are not asserted by the\ndivine author.\n\nAnother way of explaining how a medium of divine propositional\nrevelation could possibly contain errors, is by distinguishing between\nthe statements that are expressed through the medium (the\nbiblical text), and the sometimes problematic cultural\npresuppositions in terms of which they are expressed\n(Swinburne 2007: Ch. 2). Since it is probably impossible to make\nstatements that do not depend on the presuppositions of any particular\nculture, and since all cultures embody some false beliefs and\nproblematic conceptions, it is to be expected, argues Swinburne, that\na divine revelation will be expressed by means of presuppositions some\nof which are false (for criticism, see Stump 1994: 740\u2013741).\n\nThe discussion about propositional revelation in the Bible or other\nsacred documents raises questions about God\u2019s causal role in the\nproduction of the text. A common view is that the Bible (or the\nQur\u2019an) acquires its status as revelation and/or as being\n\u201cauthored\u201d by God as a result of its being\ninspired by God. According to a common understanding,\ninspiration is a special divine influence on the writers of the\nbiblical books. (Not all theologians accept this view of biblical\ninspiration, however, see, e.g., Trembath 1987: 5, 109\u2013118;\nBurtchaell 1969: Ch. 5.) The divine influence could conceivably take\ndifferent forms (Davies 2009: 41\u201344; Burtchaell 1969). According\nto theories of \u201cverbal inspiration\u201d, God provides a quite\ndetailed guidance by controlling the authors\u2019 choice of words.\nThis theory does not necessarily entail divine\n\u201cdictation\u201d, however; dictation theories are best\nconceived as a subspecies of verbal inspiration. \u201cContent\ntheories\u201d also come in different forms. Some involve a detailed\ndivine guidance on the level of statements or propositions, while\nother versions portray inspiration as limited to the main ideas of the\ntext. It is also possible to posit different degrees and modes of\ninspiration in different parts of the Bible (O\u2019Collins 2016a:\n160\u2013161). Another, rather recent theory suggests that God,\nthrough his \u201cmiddle-knowledge\u201d, could providentially have\ncontrolled the human authors of the Bible without taking away their\nfreedom (Craig 1999). Lastly, the theory of \u201csocial\ninspiration\u201d (sometimes \u201cecclesial inspiration\u201d)\ntries to account for the fact that the biblical books have a complex\nhistory of origin which involves, besides authors and redactors,\nprocesses of oral transmission in liturgical and other social contexts\n(Benoit 1965: 24\u201326; Barr 1983: 27; Farkasfalvy 2010: 211).\nPresumably, if God is to control the outcome of such a process, he\nmust influence social groups over extended periods of time.\n\nWhat is the relationship between divine inspiration and the\nidea of divine authorship of the Bible? According to\nWolterstorff, these are quite distinct phenomena. Inspiration has to\ndo with God\u2019s superintendence over the production of a\ntext, while divine authorship has to do with God\u2019s\nauthorization of a text (Wolterstorff 1995: 41\u201342). In\nprinciple, God could authorize or appropriate a certain\ntext\u2014making it his own by \u201csigning\u201d it, as it\nwere\u2014without having superintended or influenced its production\nin any way. Of course, God must do something in order for\nauthorization to happen, for example influencing the process of\ncanonization. For Wolterstorff, however, the Bible\u2019s status as\nauthored by God does not essentially depend on its being inspired.\nThat said, \n\n\nit would be bizarre to think of God as just finding these books lying\nabout and deciding to appropriate them. (Wolterstorff 1995: 187) \n\n\nSome kind of divine inspiration seems very probable also on\nWolterstorff\u2019s view. (For the justification of belief in\ninspiration, see Crisp 2009.)\n\nAccording to traditional Christian perspectives, on the other hand,\ndivine inspiration is an essential condition for divine authorship\n(see, e.g., Feingold 2016: 284). This is true of traditional Catholic\nas well as Protestant views, which both assume a pervasive divine\nguidance that extends to all parts of the biblical text and guarantees\nthe aptness of the authors\u2019 choice of words (without necessarily\ninvolving \u201cdictation\u201d). Traditional views also presume\nthat inspiration entails inerrancy\u2014that is, freedom from errors\nin all respects, not just with respect to essential contents\n(Burtchaell 1969: 1\u20132; for a critique of inerrancy, see Abraham\n1981: Ch. 1). \n\nCan a \u201cstrong\u201d theory of inspiration of this sort be\ndefended? Besides challenges from contemporary biblical criticism,\nsuch views also face the challenge to explain how inspiration is\ncompatible with the freedom of the human authors (which few would want\nto deny) and their status as genuine authors rather than mere puppets.\nPerhaps the best shot at success belongs to those who defend a\ntraditional view from the standpoint of a Thomistic understanding of\ndivine causality. From such a perspective, God is the principal cause\nand the human authors of the Bible are secondary or instrumental\ncauses (see Feingold 2016: 289\u2013295; for criticism, see Rahner\n1964). Instrumental causes are real causes, so the human authors are\nreal authors. Moreover, God presumably does not choose instrumental\ncauses arbitrarily, but with an eye to their aptness for the effects\nhe has in mind (i.e., the texts). The diversity found in the Bible\ncould hence be precisely what God aimed at in choosing people with\ndifferent temperaments, skills, and experiences as his instruments.\nStill, since the effect of an instrumental cause transcends the power\nof that cause taken alone and manifests the power of the principal\ncause, it is appropriate to say that God is the principal author of\nthe Bible. Moreover, according to the Thomistic view, God acts through\ninstrumental causes in a way that respects their nature, and this is\ntrue also when God uses human free will as an instrument. The human\nauthors, hence, are \u201cliving and free instruments\u201d rather\nthan puppets (Feingold 2016: 290).\n\nA potential weakness of this account is that it presumes a\ncontroversial (and possibly incoherent) view about the compatibility\nof human freedom and divine causality. On the other hand, precisely by\nadopting this view, the account avoids the implausible conclusion that\nGod and human authors are involved in a kind of \u201cdivision of\nlabor\u201d (God being responsible for some aspects of the text,\ne.g., the ideas, and human authors for other aspects, e.g., the\nwords). If divine and human causality are not related in the manner of\na \u201czero-sum game\u201d, both God and the human authors could be\ninvolved in shaping all aspects of the text. However, some authors\nclaim that a \u201cMolinistic\u201d approach, based on God\u2019s\n\u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d, could also account for the\ndivine-human character of the Bible as a whole, while avoiding some\nproblematic aspects of the Thomistic view (Craig 1999).\n1.3 Models of Revelation\n\nThe distinction between propositional and manifestational revelation\nis very general, and a more fine-grained classification of conceivable\nmeans of revelation is desirable. We have already seen that\npropositional (or non-manifestational) revelation can be subdivided\ninto \u201cthe causation model\u201d and \u201cthe communication\nmodel\u201d. Beyond this, the theologian Avery Dulles has suggested a\ntypology useful for categorizing theories of manifestational\nrevelation. He divides contemporary theological accounts of revelation\ninto five major classes depending on \u201ctheir central vision of\nhow and where revelation occurs\u201d (Dulles 1992: 27). Besides\npropositional revelation (which he calls \u201cRevelation as\nDoctrine\u201d), Dulles discerns four basic models for\nmanifestational revelation.\n\nRevelation as History. This model identifies revelation with\nGod\u2019s \u201cgreat deeds\u201d in salvation history. The Bible\nis seen as the record of these deeds, for example the Exodus or the\nresurrection of Jesus. The biblical text itself, however, is not part\nof revelation. Some representatives of this approach hold that\nrevelation must include a supernatural cognitive assistance\n(illumination) so that the historical events can be interpreted\ncorrectly (Baillie 1956: 65). Others deny that this is necessary\n(Pannenberg 1968). \n\nRevelation as Inner Experience. According to this model,\nrevelation consists in some kind of \u201cprivileged interior\nexperience of grace or communion with God\u201d (Dulles 1992: 27).\nSome proponents claim that the interior experience is\n\u201cpre-conceptual\u201d and occurs at a depth-level of\nconsciousness that transcends and embraces our ordinary experience of\nthe world (Schleiermacher 1799 [1996: 25\u201326]; 1830 [1999:\n16\u201317]; Rahner 1978: Ch. V). Others take the relevant\nexperiences to be conceptually structured and more like perceptual\nexperiences (Alston 1991; Pike 1992). The pre-conceptual view\nencounters epistemological puzzles about how non-conceptual inner\noccurrences can justify beliefs about God, or how the experiences can\nbe about God in the first place (Proudfoot 1985).\n\nRevelation as Dialectical Presence. This model intends to\ncapture the thought of Karl Barth\u2014who is one of the most\ninfluential figures of revelation-theology in the twentieth\ncentury\u2014and his followers in the school of \u201cdialectical\ntheology\u201d. For Barth, revelation is a\n\u201cnon-objectifiable\u201d encounter with God himself in Christ,\nan event that is mediated by the Bible and the church\u2019s\nproclamation about Christ. The Bible itself, however, is not\nrevelation but merely the channel through which revelation\n\u201cflows\u201d whenever God wills this to happen. Moreover, since\nGod is \u201cWholly Other\u201d and as such unknowable for humans,\nrevelation must be described in terms of a paradoxical dialectic of\nsimultaneous \u201cunveiling\u201d and \u201cveiling\u201d.\n\u201cRevelation\u201d, says Barth, \u201cmeans the self-unveiling,\nimparted to men, of the God who by nature cannot be unveiled to\nmen\u201d (Barth 1975: 320; see also Hart 2000). It is unclear\nwhether this model manages to present a coherent account of divine\nrevelation (for a sympathetic discussion, see McCormack 2008:\n28\u201335). The intention behind the model, however, is to reconcile\nthe claim that revelation provides real, objective knowledge of God\nwith the claim that God radically transcends all human categories and\nall created media of revelation.\n\nRevelation as New Awareness. According to this model,\nrevelation means a transformation of human subjectivity, a\n\u201cfulfillment of the inner drive of the human spirit toward\nfuller consciousness\u201d. Revelation does not disclose God as an\n\u201cobject\u201d, even though God might be \u201cmysteriously\npresent as the transcendent dimension of human engagement in creative\ntasks\u201d. In essence, revelation is more about seeing the self and\nthe world in a new light than about knowledge of God (Dulles 1992: 98,\n99, 28).\n\nDulles\u2019s models are theoretical constructions or\n\u201cideal-types\u201d, and elements from different models can be\ncombined. For example, theologians like Paul Tillich and Karl Rahner\ncombine the \u201cnew awareness\u201d model with experiential and\nhistorical elements (Tillich 1951: 111\u2013118, 120\u2013122;\nRahner 1966). It has been argued, however, that none of the\nmanifestational models presented above can provide\u2014either\nseparately or in combination\u2014a reasonable account of how\nknowledge of God\u2019s \u201ctheistic properties\u201d\n(omnipotence, omniscience and infinite goodness) comes about. Such an\naccount requires appeal to propositional revelation at some point, or\nat least to traditional natural theology (Wahlberg 2014: Ch. 3).\n2.The Justification of Revelatory Claims\n\nA revelatory claim is a claim to the effect that a certain divine\nrevelation (propositional or manifestational) has taken\nplace\u2014that God has revealed x to P (Menssen &\nSullivan 2007: 69). The existence of revelatory claims in different\nreligions raises the question of epistemic justification: Could such\nclaims be justified, and in that case, how? \u201cBeing\njustified\u201d will here be understood in the very general sense of\nhaving \u201cpositive epistemic status\u201d (the status of being\n\u201cright, or proper, or acceptable, or approvable or up to\nstandard\u201d (Plantinga 1988: 1). \n\nIn the contemporary debate, there are both non-inferential and\ninferential (evidentialist) models of justification for revelatory\nclaims. In addition, there are positions that some might characterize\nas fideistic, but that are perhaps better described as portraying the\njustification of revelation as \u201ctotally sui\ngeneris\u201d. Below non-inferential, inferential and \u201csui\ngeneris\u201d positions will be treated in turn. However, since the\ncontemporary debates about justification draw inspiration from a long\ntradition of reflection within theology, it will be useful first to\nconsider some historical background.\n2.1 Traditional Views\n\nIn historical Christian thought, the concepts of (special) revelation\nand faith go together. Faith is the believing response to the\ndivine revelation (Dulles 1992: 4). There has been a broad consensus\nthat the act of faith requires grace in the sense of an internal,\ndivine influence or assistance. However, classical Christian thinkers\nalso agree that the act of faith is reasonable, and that Christian\nbelief is epistemically justified to an eminent degree (Lamont 2004:\n46). In modern parlance, \u201cfaith\u201d is often understood as\nsynonymous with \u201cunsupported belief\u201d, but this\nunderstanding is alien to the historical tradition, for which faith\nconstitutes a form of knowledge. It is traditionally agreed, moreover,\nthat faith has this rational status because it is based on the\nauthority of God\u2019s own testimony. In much pre-modern theology it\nis unclear, however, exactly how God\u2019s testimony or speech is\nidentified as such, and what warrants this identification. \n\nImportant church fathers such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen,\nChrysostom and Augustine all held that there are good arguments from\npublicly accessible evidence for the veridicality of the Christian\nrevelation\u2014arguments that establish the claim that God has\nspoken beyond reasonable doubt. Patristic arguments typically appeal\nto fulfilled prophecies, miracles, \n\n\nthe extension and holiness of the Church, the transformative power of\nthe Christian message and the independently establishable goodness and\ntruth of Christian teaching. (Lamont 2004: 46, 38) \n\n\nHowever, the major church fathers did not seem to view these\napologetic arguments as necessary for proper faith, or as the\nepistemic basis for faith. Instead, the divine revelation\nitself\u2014the word of God\u2014is often portrayed as having the\npower to non-inferentially justify Christian beliefs. As Clement of\nAlexandria writes, \n\n\nHe who has believed in the divine Scriptures, with a firm judgement,\nreceives as an irrefutable demonstration the voice of God who gave us\nthose Scriptures. So faith is no longer something that is confirmed by\ndemonstration. (Stromate II, 2, 9, quoted in Lamont 2004: 32)\n\n\n\nAugustine, likewise, emphasized that Christian belief is produced by\nGod working internally in the believer through grace.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas affirms both the supernatural,\ngrace-induced character of Christian belief and its rational warrant.\nSince Aquinas is a common reference point in contemporary discussions\nabout faith and revelation, it will be helpful to consider his thought\nin a bit more detail. (For a comparison between Aquinas\u2019s\nthought on revelation with Jewish and Islamic medieval perspectives,\nsee Dobie 2019.) Aquinas believes that the Christian revelatory claim\ncan be justified, at least to a significant degree, by inferential\narguments (see, e.g., Summa Contra Gentiles I, Ch. 6).\nSometimes he seems to suggest that arguments are necessary for\nrational assent to revelation (Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 2,\na. 9, ad. 3). At other times, however, it appears that faith is\njustified without arguments (ST II-II, q. 27, a. 3, ad. 2.\nSee also Niederbacher 2012: 342\u2013343). Due to this tension, there\nare different interpretations of Aquinas. John Jenkins has helpfully\ndistinguished between the Naturalist Interpretation, the\nVoluntarist Interpretation, and the Supernatural\nExternalist Interpretation (Jenkins 1997: Ch. 6). These\ninterpretations emphasize different elements of Aquinas\u2019s\nthought that are also found in traditional theology in general. As we\nwill see in the following sections, similar elements recur in\ncontemporary theories. \n\nAccording to the Naturalist Interpretation, at least some\npersons assent to the articles of the Creed because, first, they\naccept a cluster of arguments from natural theology, second, they\nbelieve on the basis of human testimony and other evidence that\nmiracles and other signs have occurred in biblical history and in the\nhistory of the church. From these considerations they conclude that\nGod has made a revelation in history, which is contained, in its\nessence, in the Creed. The Christian revelatory claim is justified on\nthis inferential basis. Grace and God\u2019s supernatural influence\nhas little epistemic significance in this process\u2014grace just\nmakes the believer accept God\u2019s revelation without\nreluctance (Penelhum 1977: 146; see also Hick 1988:\n11\u201331).\n\nThe Voluntarist Interpretation, on the other hand, claims\nthat a consideration of the evidence is insufficient to elicit firm\nassent to revelation. What brings this forth, instead, is something\nlike \u201cwishful thinking\u201d or utilitarian considerations.\nAquinas says: \n\n\nWe are moved to believe the words of God insofar as the reward of\neternal life is promised to us if we have believed; and this moves the\nwill to assent. (De Veritate, q. 14, a. 1, quoted in Jenkins\n1997: 176) \n\n\nAn act of the will compensates for the \u201cgap in the\nevidence\u201d. However, since the activity of the will\u2014when it\ncomes to belief in God\u2014is part of a reliable belief-forming\nprocess put in place by grace, the beliefs that it produces are\nwarranted. Aquinas, hence, was an epistemological reliabilist of\nsorts, according to this view (Ross 1985; Stump 1991).\n\nThe Supernatural Externalist Interpretation gives arguments\nfrom public evidence a role in preparing a person for the assent of\nfaith. However, the actual assent is the product of a supernaturally\ninfused cognitive habit. The supernatural \u201clight of faith\u201d\nmakes it possible for a person immediately and non-inferentially to\ngrasp the articles of the Creed as divinely revealed. Belief\nin the revelatory claim is hence a basic belief, and it is\njustified \n\n\nbecause it was arrived at by the proper operation of a cognitive\nprocess which, though infused and not [natural], was nevertheless\ndesigned to attain the truth in this sphere. (Jenkins 1997:\n190\u2013191)\n\n\nMost contemporary Aquinas scholars now reject the Naturalist\nInterpretation, which cannot do justice to the textual evidence.\nHence, even though Aquinas indeed presents a collection of credibility\narguments, he seems to have held that belief in divine revelation can\nbe\u2014and usually is\u2014justified in some other, non-inferential\nway. It is therefore unfortunate that the view represented by the\nNaturalist Interpretation is sometimes taken to be \u201cthe\ntraditional view\u201d of how revelatory claims are justified\n(Penelhum 1997: 67\u201386). \n\nAlthough Aquinas might not be a good fit for \u201cthe traditional\nview\u201d, some later thinkers are. Starting with Duns Scotus, the\nrole of inferential arguments in the rational acceptance of revelation\nwas gradually expanded and made more precise in mainstream Christian\nthought. From the seventeenth century to the mid-twentieth century,\nmost Catholic theologians saw \u201ccredibility arguments\u201d as\nnecessary for faith and as capable of establishing beyond reasonable\ndoubt that God has revealed the Christian religion (Lamont 2004:\n87\u201388). The act of faith was reduced to the drawing of the\nnecessary inference from this insight to the conclusion that Christian\nbeliefs are true. On the Protestant side, this development continued\nand culminated in thinkers such as William Chillingworth, John\nTillotson and John Locke, whose views\u2014ironically\u2014are the\nclosest matches to what Penelhum describes as the \u201ctraditional\nview\u201d. As we have seen, however, the church fathers and Thomas\nAquinas held more complex views in which elements of both inferential\nand non-inferential justification are found, and where supernatural\ngrace and the will play important epistemic roles. Below we will\nencounter again these elements in the accounts of contemporary\nphilosophers and theologians. \n2.2 Non-Inferential Justification\n\nA claim is non-inferentially justified when its positive epistemic\nstatus is a result of some form of direct cognition, as opposed to\nbeing achieved through a process of inference from evidence. The\nnotion of \u201cdirect cognition\u201d includes having a belief that\nis \u201cproperly basic\u201d, but also having a belief that\ndirectly represents the content of a perceptual experience (assuming\nthat experiences have conceptual content). \n\nThere are non-inferential views concerning both the justification of\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d revelation. In this\nsection, three varieties of non-inferential justification will be\naddressed: Perceptual models, Plantinga\u2019s A/C-model, and\ntestimonial models.\n2.2.1 Perceptual Models\n\nSome philosophers have suggested a perceptual interpretation of\nnatural revelation, according to which \u201cintentional\ndesign\u201d is a property that can be directly perceived in nature\nas well as in human behavior and art. Since intentional design by\ndefinition entails a designer, this means that our experiences of\nnature could give us immediate knowledge of the existence of a creator\n(Ratzsch 2003; Wahlberg 2012; Plantinga 2011: Ch. 8). For related\nviews, see Mullen 2004 and Evans 2010).\n\nThe putative plausibility of this hypothesis depends on the\nphenomenological observation that the appearance of design in\nnature is something that forcefully strikes most people, even\natheists. As Hume lets Cleanthes say: \n\n\nConsider, anatomize the eye \u2026 and tell me, from your own\nfeeling, if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in\nupon you with a force like that of a sensation?. (Dialogues\nConcerning Natural Religion, Part III, (p. 65)) \n\n\nPsychological research, moreover, indicates that teleological beliefs\nabout nature come natural to humans. Some even argue that humans are\n\u201cintuitive theists\u201d (Kelemen 2004; Barrett 2012). A\nrelated consideration in favor of design-perception is that it could\npotentially explain why beliefs about design in nature are so\nwidespread and often held so persistently, even though they have\nturned out to be hard to justify by argument (Ratzsch 2003:\n135\u2013136).\n\nA standard move by those who claim that belief in revelation is\nnon-inferentially justified, is to appeal to the\n\u201cparity-argument\u201d (first found in Thomas Reid\n[1710\u20131796], see Wolterstorff 2001: 197\u2013206; see also\nPlantinga 1990: 271; Alston 1983). Adapted to the present context, the\nargument runs something like this: Since beliefs about intentional\ndesign in nature arise in a similar way as (ordinary) perceptual\nbeliefs and memory beliefs, there is no reason to discriminate among\nthese classes of beliefs with respect to their prima facie\nepistemic status. Hence, if we regard perceptual and memory beliefs as\nprima facie justified without argument, we should regard\ndesign-beliefs in the same way. \n\nIt could be objected that in order to have beliefs about design, a\nrather complex conceptual background is necessary. Design beliefs,\ntherefore, cannot be understood as perceptual. However, the necessity\nof a conceptual background for having a certain kind of perceptual\nbeliefs does not necessarily entail that those beliefs are\ninferentially derived from the background (McDowell 2004: 296;\nWahlberg 2012: 128\u2013130. See also McGrath 2008: Ch. 5). Even the\nmost primitive perceptual beliefs (\u201cred here now\u201d)\npresuppose a network of concepts.\n\nIs evolution a defeater for the idea of design-perception? (De Cruz\nand De Smedt 2014: 195). Perhaps not. The hypothesis that God creates\nindirectly, through the evolutionary process, entails that God exerts\na certain control over the outcomes of that process. This means that\nGod has intended at least certain features of the outcome, and these\nfeatures would hence count as divinely designed. Since divine design\nin this sense seems to be compatible with evolution, design-perception\nmight be as well (Wahlberg 2012: 172\u2013190; Kojonen 2018). \n\nAnother objection proceeds from the claim that design-beliefs about\nnature are generated by mechanisms that are too unreliable to confer\npositive epistemic status. One version of this argument contends that\nthe \u201chyperactiveness\u201d of our HADD (\u201cHyper-Active\nAgency Detection Device\u201d)\u2014which is an evolutionary\nadaptation for detecting possibly dangerous agency in the natural\nenvironment\u2014means that it produces too many false positives to\nbe trusted when it \u201cdetects\u201d design in natural structures.\nThe debate about this is ongoing (Barrett 2004: 31; Visala 2011: Ch.\n5; De Smedt and De Cruz 2020).\n\nIn the realm of special revelation, there are also theories\nof direct, perceptual justification. William Alston has argued for the\npossibility that God could be (nonsensorially) perceived, and that\nsuch \u201cmystical perception\u201d can justify beliefs about God\n(Alston 1991). Different religions have different, socially\nestablished \u201cdoxastic practices\u201d (belief-forming habits)\nbuilt on purported experiences of God. Appealing to the parity\nargument, Alston contends that such mystical practices can be on more\nor less equal footing, epistemically, with basic doxastic practices\nsuch as sense-perceptual and memory-based belief-forming. In general,\nbasic doxastic practices cannot be shown to be reliable without\ncircularity, but if they are socially established and their outputs\nare reasonably internally consistent and consistent with the outputs\nof other practices, they can be rationally engaged in. The case for\nthe rationality of a doxastic practice is also strengthened if it\ngenerates significant \u201cself-support\u201d\u2014for example by\nmaking predictions that are later confirmed.\n\nBeliefs generated by rational doxastic practices can, however, be\ndefeated by \u201cover-rider\u201d-systems internal to the practices\nthemselves. In the case of \u201cmystical perception\u201d, the\noverrider-system includes a religion\u2019s doctrinal teaching, by\nwhich the veridicality of purported mystical perceptions is tested.\nAlston argues that the \u201cChristian mystical practice\u201d,\nwhich generates significant self-support by the way it can\n\u201cpredict\u201d or guide spiritual development, can be\nrationally engaged in, and hence produce beliefs about God that are\nprima facie justified. While mystical perceptions of the kind\nAlston deals with are often regarded as rare, Michael Rea has argued\nthat experiences of God\u2019s presence and of communication from God\nmight be \u201cwidely available\u201d (Rea 2018: Ch. 6\u20137). He\nsuggests that the ability to experience God can be improved through\nspiritual practices and disciplines\u2014an idea that is common in\nmystical traditions (see also Wynn 2013: 73\u201374).\n\nThe main problem for the idea of direct perceptual encounters with God\nis the fact of religious diversity and the seeming incompatibility\nbetween the outputs of rival mystical practices. One approach to this\nproblem is to view the incompatibility as merely apparent. Building on\nKant\u2019s distinction between noumena and phenomena, Hick argues\nthat God or ultimate reality is unknowable in itself, and that the\ndifferent descriptions of this reality produced by different religions\nonly apply within the realm of human experience (1989: Ch. 14. For\ncritique of the Kantian picture, see Plantinga 2000b: Ch. 1\u20132;\nMenssen and Sullivan 2007: 22\u201330; Macdonald 2009b: Ch. 2).\nNevertheless, those descriptions allow people to respond to and\ninteract with the Real in ways that are conducive to salvation.\n\nHick\u2019s solution to the problem of religious diversity is bought\nat the price of denying the incompatibility that religious believers\nthemselves see between their religious beliefs and those of other\nreligions. Finding this price too high, Alston takes the disagreements\nbetween religions to be real, and argues that there could be realms of\nreality \n\n\nthat are so difficult for us to discern that widespread agreement is\nextremely difficult or impossible to attain, even if some\nveridical cognition of that realm is achieved. (Alston 1991: 267)\n\n\nA position that lies between Hick\u2019s non-cognitivist pluralism\nand Alston\u2019s cognitivist exclusivism is Keith Ward\u2019s\n\u201copen theology\u201d that is attentive to the possibility of\nrevelation in all religions. This possibility entails, for Ward, that\nbelievers must be prepared to critically question their own tradition\nin light of insights from other religions (Ward 1994: 339\u2013340).\nAnother option is Griffiths\u2019 \u201copen inclusivism\u201d,\nbased on the claim that \u201cit is possible that alien religions\nteach truths of religious significance to the Church\u201d (2001:\n63).\n\nBesides experiences that have God as their putative object, other\nkinds of religious experiences could be revelatory as well. Mark Wynn\nhas drawn attention to the \u201cmaterially mediated or sacramental\ncharacter of much religious experience\u201d and suggested that the\nexperiential impact of certain \u201cmaterial contexts\u201d (such\nas special places with an existentially charged history) could mediate\nan awareness of God (Wynn 2009: 147; see also Wynn 2013: Ch. 3). \n2.2.2 The A/C-Model\n\nNon-inferential justification of revelatory claims need not be\nconstrued as perceptual. Alvin Plantinga, while sympathetic to\nperceptual theories of natural revelation (2000b: 286\u2013289; 2011:\nCh. 8), has proposed a broader account involving both general and\nspecial revelation. He suggests that humans have a natural cognitive\nfaculty which \u201cin a wide variety of circumstances produces in us\nbeliefs about God\u201d. Those beliefs are \u201coccasioned\u201d\nby the circumstances\u2014for example by the sight of a mighty\nscenery or a beautiful sunset\u2014but they are not conclusions from\nthem, not even \u201cquick and sotto voce inferences\u201d.\nHowever, the theistic beliefs thus caused could have positive\nepistemic status if the cognitive faculty that produces them is\n\u201cfunctioning properly in a congenial epistemic environment\naccording to a design plan successfully aimed at truth\u201d\n(Plantinga 2000: 172, 175, 178). Beliefs generated by such a\nfaculty\u2014which Plantinga, following Calvin, calls a\n\u201csensus divinitatis\u201d\u2014would be\n\u201cproperly basic\u201d in the sense that they are\nnon-inferentially warranted as long as they are undefeated. \n\nPlantinga\u2019s model for the justification of natural revelation is\nexternalist, and he does not claim to be able to demonstrate that it\nis true. His agenda, instead, is to defend theistic belief from the\n\u201cde jure objection\u201d, which attacks the rational\nstatus of theism while leaving open the question of its truth.\nPlantinga claims that this attack fails. If theism is true, it is very\nlikely that there is a sensus divinitatis, and in that case,\nbelief in God would be warranted.\n\nPlantinga\u2019s model also includes the justification of special\nrevelation. In what he calls the \u201cExtended A/C-model\u201d\n(after Aquinas and Calvin), Plantinga posits, besides the natural\nsensus divinitatis, a supernatural belief-forming mechanism\nconsisting mainly in the \u201cinternal instigation of the Holy\nSpirit\u201d. This mechanism is part of God\u2019s plan of salvation\nthat also includes the divine teaching of the Scriptures, and the\ndivine repair of the cognitive and affective damage caused by sin.\nWhen confronted with the teachings of Scripture, the Holy Spirit can\ninstigate people to accept them as true by creating faith. Plantinga\nsees the beliefs accepted in this way as \u201crevealed to our\nminds\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 241). Even though this process is not an\nin-built part of human nature, it is (ex hypothesi) \u201ca\nreliable belief-producing process\u201d, and its deliverances will\ntherefore be warranted and qualify as knowledge (Plantinga 2000: 257,\n206).\n\nThe debate about Plantinga\u2019s proposals is extensive, and\ncritique comes from both theological and philosophical quarters (Baker\n2005). Some criticize Plantinga\u2019s model for being\nphenomenologically inadequate: Many believers seem to be looking for\ngrounds for their faith and feel the need for partial support from\nother beliefs (Beilby 2005: 195\u2013197). Other critics attack the\nvery idea that religious beliefs can be properly basic, which\nPlantinga defends by means of a version of the parity-argument (see\n section 2.2.1).\n Grigg, for example, argues that a major difference between religious\nbeliefs and ordinary perceptual beliefs is that people may have a bias\nin favor of religious beliefs, since there is a psychological benefit\nto be gained from believing that God exists (Grigg 1983: 126). In\nresponse, it has been argued that the same is true of some perceptual\nbeliefs (e.g., seeing high numbers in one\u2019s bank account)\n(McLeod 1987: 5). \n\nA related critique is that more or less absurd belief-systems could\nclaim to be based on properly basic beliefs. This is often referred to\nas the \u201cGreat Pumpkin Objection\u201d (see DeRose 1999 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Michael Martin, developing a version of it, claims that \n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s proposal would generate many different communities\nthat could legitimately claim that their basic beliefs are rational,\n\n\n\nsuch as voodoo or astrological communities (Martin 1990: 272). In\nresponse, Plantinga can point out that basic beliefs are defeasible,\nand that the basic beliefs of what we take to be obviously irrational\nbelief systems might be easily defeated (Baker 2007: 88\u201389).\n\nClosely related to the Great Pumpkin Objection is the objection from\nreligious diversity, perhaps the greatest challenge for\nPlantinga\u2019s as well as for Alston\u2019s theories. Why could\nnot proponents of other religions copy Plantinga\u2019s\nepistemological moves and adapt them to their own religions? (Hill\n2001). Helm, accordingly, suggests that Plantinga\u2019s argument\n\u201cleaves his defense of the rationality of Christian theism not\nso much open to refutation as to imitation\u201d (Helm 2001: 1112).\nIn response, it could be argued that if a religion is false, defeaters\nwill probably arise.\n\nAnother type of objections focus on the epistemic consequences of\nreligious disagreement. Some critics argue that if other religions\n\u201ccan make as good a case of being knowledge-if-true as\nChristianity\u201d, it is hard to see why people should remain\nChristians in the absence of some religiously neutral grounds (Forrest\n2002: 111.) Basinger suggests that religious believers who want to\nmaximize truth and avoid error are \u201cunder a prima facie\nobligation to attempt to resolve significant epistemic peer\nconflict\u201d (Basinger 2002: 11). However, it might not always be\neasy to determine when people are true \u201cepistemic peers\u201d,\nand the crucial question is what happens if the disagreement, despite\nefforts of resolution, remains (Plantinga 1997). Should disagreement\nbe taken as a defeater of belief? Plantinga has claimed that this idea\nis a \u201cphilosophical tar baby\u201d, since it would mean the\ndefeat of the religious pluralist position as certainly as that of his\nown (2000a: 177; see also Alston 1988). Still, it could be argued that\nwhile disagreement is not a defeater of belief, it should lead people\nto believe with less confidence. \n\nA different kind of charge against Plantinga\u2019s model is that it\nleaves unaddressed the question of actual warrant (Baker 2007:\n87\u201389). \n\n\nThere is \u2026 a monumental issue which Plantinga does not discuss,\nand which a lot of people will consider needs discussing. This is\nwhether Christian beliefs do have warrant \u2026 He has shown that\nthey do, if they are true; so we might hope for discussion of whether\nthey are true. (Swinburne 2001: 206) \n\n\nMaybe the sense of dissatisfaction expressed by Swinburne can be\nsomewhat mitigated by attending to the distinction between\n\u201cbeing rational in holding a theistic belief\u201d and\n\u201cshowing that theistic belief is rational\u201d\n(Sudduth 2003: 311).\n2.2.3 Testimonial Models\n\nThe idea of divine testimony is at the core of traditional\nconceptions of revelation in both Jewish-Christian and Islamic thought\n(for the latter, see Adeel 2019: 30\u201335). However, testimony and\nthe justification of testimonial beliefs can be understood in\ndifferent ways. Within contemporary philosophy of testimony, there are\ntwo basic schools. Reductionists hold that beliefs acquired\nthrough testimony must be justified by an (implicit or explicit)\nargument from evidence that establishes the trustworthiness of the\nwitness. Anti-reductionists deny this and regard testimony as\na basic, sui generis source of epistemic justification, like\nperception and memory. Hence, for anti-reductionists, testimonial\nbeliefs are non-inferentially justified. This view has interesting\nimplications for the issue of belief in divine revelation.\n\nInspired by Aquinas as well as by contemporary anti-reductionism\n(especially John McDowell), Lamont argues that the ability to gain\nknowledge from truthful testimony is an intellectual virtue, together\nwith perception and memory (Lamont 2004: Ch. 5). When a hearer\nH believes a speaker S testifying that p, the\nvery fact that S knows p and sincerely testifies to\np gives H knowledge of p, which entails that\nH has a knowledge-constituting justification for p. This\njustification is not reducible to H\u2019s evidence for the\ntrustworthiness of S.\n\nLamont argues, on theological grounds, that God speaks through the\nChurch, and that the Bible is part of this divine speech (Lamont 2004:\nCh. 7). When a person believes a biblical statement because it is\nspoken by God, what the person acquires is testimonial knowledge. This\nknowledge is justified and counts as knowledge by the very fact that\nit comes from God\u2019s own testimony. However, a condition for\nbelieving a biblical statement because it is spoken by God,\nis that the hearer is able to recognize it as God\u2019s\nspeech. This recognition happens, according to Lamont, through the\neffects that the divine message has on the hearer. Following John\nOwen, Lamont appeals to the moral enlightenment and transformation of\nthe hearer that result when the divine message is heard. These\neffects, argues Lamont, can only happen through divine power, and they\nare therefore clear signs that allow the hearer to recognize the\ndivine identity of the speaker (Lamont 2004: 198\u2013206).\nThe hearer, hence, can believe God, and so acquire the\nsatisfactory epistemic standing that God\u2019s testimony\nprovides.\n\nIt can be questioned whether there are moral transformations that\nprove the involvement of a divine power (King 2008: 74).\nHowever, supposing that the divine origin of the Christian message\ncould really be established in this way, it seems to follow that\nLamont\u2019s anti-reductionist account of testimony has no important\nepistemic role to play in his analysis of revealed knowledge. If we\ncan infer, from certain effects of the message, that it is God who has\nspoken, then we can also infer that the message is true (since God\nwould not lie or be mistaken). This seems to make appeal to testimony\nas a basic source of knowledge/justification superfluous.\n\n\nWahlberg (2014) has attempted to formulate a consistently\nanti-reductionist theory of knowledge by divine testimony. He suggests\nthat one can identify divine speech by relying on God\u2019s own\nsay-so. An example would be if a person believes Jesus when Jesus\nclaims to speak for God (supposing that his claim is true). In such a\nscenario, one would acquire testimonial knowledge from God\u2019s\ntestimony (through Jesus) without (initially) knowing that it is God\nwho speaks (Wahlberg 2014: Ch. 6; see also Lamont 1996).\n\nHowever, wouldn\u2019t it be irrational just to believe a guy who\nclaims to speak for God? Wahlberg acknowledges that normally, it\nwould. He argues that in order for a Hearer H to be able to\nabsorb trustworthy testimony from a speaker S in such as way\nthat knowledge ensues, H must exercise doxastic\nresponsibility. This means that she must be sensitive to and on\nthe lookout for evidence and considerations that speak\nagainst the trustworthiness of S. If H fails to\ndisplay such sensitivity, she cannot acquire knowledge from\nanyone\u2019s testimony, even if it happens to be true. Now, doxastic\nresponsibility clearly demands that testimony that purports to come\nfrom God be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism. In order for\na responsible hearer to be able to absorb such testimony in a way that\nyields knowledge (supposing that the testimony really transmits\nrevelation), there must be some circumstance that defeats the natural\nreasons for mistrust (such as the possibility that a putative prophet\nlies or is deluded).\n\nWahlberg claims that a miracle can constitute such a circumstance. If\nJesus in fact rose from the dead, his closest disciples who saw his\npost-mortem appearances would have been in a position to believe\n(without doxastic irresponsibility) Jesus\u2019 claim to speak for\nGod. This means that they could have known the truth of a revelatory\nclaim on the basis of God\u2019s own testimony.\n\nBut what about those people who do not witness a miracle? Wahlberg\nargues that knowledge of Jesus\u2019 resurrection could be available,\nthrough the biblical testimony, to non-witnesses, for example to\npeople who live today. The biblical testimony about the resurrection,\nin turn, can be believed without doxastic irresponsibility by people\nwho live today due to the historical-critical evidence that supports\nit and defeats the natural reasons for skepticism. According to\nWahlberg, knowledge of the resurrection gained in this way would be\nnon-inferentially justified by testimony (as a basic or sui\ngeneris source of justification), rather than by inference from\nthe available historical-critical evidence. The latter evidence is not\ngood enough for knowledge, but only for enabling responsible belief.\n\n\nWahlberg\u2019s case for doxastic responsibility depends on a\ncontroversial assessment of the strength of the historical-critical\ncase for Jesus\u2019 resurrection. Another potential problem is the\nfact that most Christians do not know the historical-critical evidence\nfor the resurrection. Does it follow that most Christians do not\nbelieve in divine revelation responsibly? (Griffiths 2018). To address\nthis difficulty, Wahlberg appeals to the social nature of knowledge,\nand argues that individuals can satisfy the requirements of doxastic\nresponsibility in virtue of the epistemic competence inherent in the\ncommunities they belong to.\n2.3 Inferential Justification\n\nThis section will continue, for a while, with the theme of divine\ntestimony, but now from a reductionist perspective. The accounts\nstudied so far work with an anti-reductionist (non-inferential) view\nof testimonial justification. However, it can be argued that when it\ncomes to believing purportedly divine testimony, the stakes are too\nhigh for it to be rational to trust without positive evidence of\ntrustworthiness (King 2008: 78).\n\nAccording to King, rational belief in divine self-testimony requires\nthat God gives us \u201csufficient evidence to trust in him\u201d\n(King 2008: 176). We can know by a priori reasoning what kind\nof evidence God must provide in order to win our trust, and so we can\nanticipate that God (if he exists) will provide this kind of evidence.\nImportantly, a divine revelation must be \u201cdiscrete\u201d and\navailable only to a few people at first, since a \u201cmajor\u201d\nrevelation immediately apparent for a global audience would obscure\nGod\u2019s love with overwhelming power. King provides a list of\npossible evidences that satisfy the requirement of discreetness,\nincluding \u201ca sense of [divine] presence\u201d, \u201cinternal\ncommunication (including dreams, visions)\u201d, \u201cfulfilled\nprophecies, Resurrection, Incarnation\u201d. Any conceivable\nrevelation must choose its means from this list and hence conform to a\nnecessary structure, which accommodates the cognitive limitations of\nhuman beings and makes it possible for them to trust in a rational\nway. King refers to his epistemological model as\n\u201ctrust-evidentialism\u201d (2008: 174, 176).\n\nEven though King\u2019s account is ostensibly different from the\nnon-inferential testimonial models presented above, the differences\nmight be smaller than first appears. As we have seen, \u201cdoxastic\nresponsibility\u201d requires extensive reasoning from evidence in\nWahlberg\u2019s account, even though such reasoning is construed as\ndefeater-deflecting rather than as trust-grounding.\n\nAs the example of King illustrates, inferential models for the\njustification of revelation can be construed as testimonial, if\ntestimonial justification is understood in a reductionist way. John\nLocke is a classic example of this. \n\n\nFaith \u2026 is the assent to any proposition \u2026 upon the\ncredit of the proposer, as coming from God, in some extraordinary way\nof communication. This way of discovering truths to men we call\nRevelation. (Essay Concerning Human Understanding,\nIV, xviii, 2) \n\n\nHowever, testimonial justification, for Locke, is reducible to\nargument from evidence.\n2.3.1 A Probabilistic Argument\n\nIn order to see the general strengths and problems of inferential\nmodels of justification, it will be helpful to focus on a paradigmatic\nexample in the tradition of Tillotson and Locke. Perhaps the most\ninfluential evidentialist account of the justification of revelatory\nclaims is the one proposed by Richard Swinburne. His argument can be\nformalized using probability calculus and Bayes Theorem (Swinburne\n2007: 345\u2013356), but the discussion below will proceed\ninformally. After a presentation of Swinburne\u2019s argument, some\ncritical and complementary perspectives will be addressed. \n\nFor Swinburne, rational acceptance of a revelatory claim must be based\non evidence, and how strong the evidence needs to be depends on what\nbackground beliefs we have. If we have good reason to believe,\nindependently of any purported revelation, that God exists and that a\nrevelation from him is to be expected, then rational acceptance of a\nrevelatory claim can be based on more modest evidence than would\notherwise be the case. It is hence important for Swinburne to build a\ncase for the existence of God based on natural theology, and then\nestablish the likelihood of a revelation on the basis of a\npriori reasoning about what God is likely to do.\n\nSwinburne thinks that natural theological arguments make God\u2019s\nexistence at least as probable as his non-existence, and that a\npriori reasoning about God leads to the conclusion that a\nrevelation is to be expected. A God who has made rational creatures\nwould want to interact with them, and for this to be possible, they\nwould need to know more about God\u2019s nature and character than\nwhat is naturally accessible to them. Furthermore, it would be good\nfor humans to receive moral enlightenment from God, and encouragement\nto live morally good lives. Since God is good, these considerations\nmake a revelation likely. Moreover, Swinburne argues that a good God\nwould have reason to become incarnate in order to atone for\nsin and to identify with our suffering. If this is to be effectual, a\nrevelation that tells us about the incarnation and atonement is\nnecessary. It is also to be expected that a divine revelation would\nnot come with overwhelming evidence in its favor but require some\nsearching activity on the part of humans. This would encourage human\ncooperation and co-responsibility and strengthen desire for the goal\nof salvation. Since a revelation would have to be translated between\ndifferent cultures and across time, there must also be included in the\nrevelation some means of continuing guidance\u2014a church that can\nensure that interpretations and translations are correct (Swinburne\n2007: 103\u2013104. For a more fully developed perspective on the\necclesial mediation of revelation, see Levering 2014).\n\nArmed with the purported background knowledge that a certain kind of\nrevelation is likely, Swinburne suggests four \u201ctests\u201d or\ncriteria for credible revelatory claims (Swinburne 2007: Ch. 6). The\nfirst criterion is that the content of a purported revelation concerns\nthings that are important for our deepest well-being, and that this\ncontent is not very improbable on grounds independent of revelation.\nThis \u201ccontent test\u201d must be complemented by a\n\u201cmiracle test\u201d, which is the second criterion. If God\nwants us to be able to identify a divine revelation as such, he must\ndeliver it in a way that only God could do. This requires a divine\nsignature in the form of a confirming miracle, in the sense of a\nviolation of a natural law. Third, if a revelation is to have a\ndeterminate content that is not endlessly open to interpretation, a\ngenuine revelation must contain instructions for how an interpretive\nchurch is to be constituted, and the interpretations of this church\nmust be plausible as interpretations of the original revelation. The\nfourth test is that the church\u2019s interpretations of revelation\nmust not be very implausible on other, independent grounds.\n\nWhen applying these tests to the great world religions, Swinburne\nclaims to find that the purported Christian revelation is the only\nserious candidate. No other religion can point to a reasonable amount\nof evidence for a foundational, authenticating miracle like the\nresurrection of Jesus, nor does any other religion satisfy the other\nthree tests. This shows that the coincidence of the satisfaction of\nall four tests (even to a moderate degree) \u201cis an extremely\nunlikely event in the normal course of things\u201d (Swinburne 2007:\n337). Since Christianity satisfies all four tests, according to\nSwinburne, it is very probable that its purported revelation is true.\nIn order to show that Christianity satisfies the tests, Swinburne\nproduces a complex argument based on evidence from many sources (for\nexample, historical arguments about the acts and teachings of Jesus,\nevidence for the resurrection, arguments for the moral goodness of\nChristian teachings, etc.). It is the cumulative force of the total\nevidence that makes belief in the Christian revelatory claim\njustified.\n\nA general criticism that can be directed against Swinburne\u2019s\naccount\u2014as well as other inferential accounts (e.g., King\n2008)\u2014is that it seems to draw on the Christian religion as a\nkind of intuition-pump for what are supposed to be \u201ca\npriori\u201d features of any genuine revelation. For example,\nSwinburne argues that it is a priori likely that God will\nbecome incarnated and atone for human sin, and that this therefore is\na part of the content-criterion by which to test purported\nrevelations. Many would argue, however, that this reasoning is\n\u201cad hoc and post eventum\u201d and biased in\nfavor of the Christian tradition (Abraham 2006: 73. See also Stump\n1994: 740; McLean 2013).\n\nSwinburne\u2019s argument invites detailed objections on practically\nevery point, but he has also defended every step of the argument\nextensively in separate works about natural theology, the incarnation,\natonement theory, and the resurrection (2004a; 1994; 1989; 2003).\nEspecially the historical argument for a resurrection is crucial for\nSwinburne\u2019s case. The debates generated by criticism of\nSwinburne\u2019s historical claims and claims about natural theology\ncannot be addressed here. However, the very fact that\nSwinburne\u2019s argument, in order to succeed, needs to establish\nmany controversial propositions has been seen, by some, as a fatal\nweakness (Plantinga 2000b, 271\u2013280; Hasker 2002: 256\u2013257).\n\nAppealing to a general \u201cprinciple of dwindling\nprobabilities\u201d, Plantinga has argued that complex inferential\ncases for Christianity of the kind Swinburne presents must necessarily\nfail. Such complex arguments chain together a number of logically\nindependent propositions, most of which are merely probable given the\nevidence. For every merely probable proposition that is needed to\nreach the conclusion, the probability of the hypothesis as a whole\nwill decrease, since the probabilities at each stage of the argument\nmust be multiplied. Plantinga argues that even if the probabilities of\nthe individual propositions are given a very generous\nestimate\u2014for example, if we assign the probability 0.9 to the\nproposition that God exists (on our background knowledge)\u2014the\noverall conclusion about the Christian revelation will still have a\nprobability well below 0.5. Plantinga, therefore, concludes that the\ninferential case for the Christian revelation \n\n\nisn\u2019t strong enough to produce warranted belief \u2026 at\nmost, it could produce the warranted belief that the main lines of\nChristian teaching aren\u2019t particularly improbable. (Plantinga\n2000b: 271)\n\n\nPlantinga\u2019s argument seems to threaten the whole inferential\nproject. In response, however, it can be argued that it proves too\nmuch. All historical arguments (even secular ones) link together\npropositions that are merely probable. If the principle of dwindling\nprobabilities is valid and has the implications that Plantinga claims,\nit could be applied to all historical arguments, with the result that\nno historical argument could succeed. This, however, is a conclusion\nthat many would be reluctant to draw (Swinburne 2004b: 540; 2007:\n356).\n\nTim and Lydia McGrew have provided what many take to be a strong\nresponse to Plantinga\u2019s argument from dwindling probabilities\n(McGrew 2004; McGrew and McGrew 2006). Basically, they argue that at\nleast the steepness of the \u201cdwindling\u201d is an illusion\ncreated by the way Plantinga (mis)represents the\ninferential-historical case for a Christian revelation. Among other\nshortcomings, Plantinga\u2019s construal fails to bring out how\nevidence for a proposition that is \u201cdownstream\u201d in the\nargument (such as \u201cGod raised Jesus from the dead\u201d) is\nrelevant for assessing the probability of a proposition that is\n\u201cupstream\u201d (such as \u201cGod exists\u201d). While\nPlantinga concedes ground to some of the critique (2006), he\nnevertheless stands by his general argument (2015: 262. For an\noverview of the debate, see Nickel 2015: 225\u2013235 and Crisp\n2009.)\n2.3.2 Holism\n\nAnother response to the purported threat of dwindling probabilities is\nsuggested by Menssen and Sullivan (2007). They defend a basically\nSwinburnian inferential project, but criticize Swinburne for being\ninsufficiently holistic, in a sense to be explained below (2007:\n55\u201356). With respect to the argument about dwindling\nprobabilities, they acknowledge that a complex proposition cannot have\na greater probability than any of its constituent claims. However,\nthey argue that in certain cases, the complex proposition \u201ccould\nstill be more believable\u201d (2007: 61). For example, the\nclaim that \u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus that is\nperturbing its orbit\u201d is more complex than the weaker claim that\n\u201cthere is a heavenly body beyond Uranus\u201d. Nevertheless,\nscientists did not first attempt to prove the weaker claim, and then\nwent on to prove the stronger (more complex) claim. Instead, they\nestablished the truth of the weaker claim by establishing the\ntruth of the stronger.\n\nThe lesson to learn from this, according to Menssen and Sullivan, is\nthat the project of justifying revelatory claims should not await the\nestablishing of God\u2019s existence by means of traditional natural\ntheology (as suggested by Swinburne 2004b: 538 and Mavrodes 1988: 102). Instead,\nrevelatory claims should be investigated as part of the project of\njustifying theism\u2014the only condition for such investigation\nbeing that the existence of a world-creator is not highly unlikely. In\nfact, \n\n\na negative conclusion concerning the existence of a good God is not\njustified unless the content of a reasonable number of leading\nrevelatory claims has been seriously considered. (Menssen and Sullivan\n2007: 63) \n\n\nThis is because the \u201cproblem of evil\u201d counts as evidence\nagainst God\u2019s existence. To exclude putative revelations from\nconsideration before God\u2019s existence has been established would\nbe to refuse to \u201clisten to the voice of the accused\u201d. What\nif a putative revelation contains an acceptable explanation of evil,\nthat blocks or weakens the atheistic arguments? Not to take this\npossibility into account would, arguably, be to handicap the\nevidentialist project by forcing it to proceed without a \u201cfull\ndatabase\u201d (Kwan 2011: 472). Hence, the \u201cholistic\u201d\napproach of Menssen and Sullivan might be seen as an improvement in\nrelation to the more traditional, \u201clayered\u201d approach of\nSwinburne. (However, Swinburne\u2019s distinction between\n\u201cbare\u201d and \u201cramified\u201d natural theology point\nin a holistic direction, see 2004b: 533\u2013535.)\n2.3.3 Voluntarism\n\nOther critics of Swinburne point out that he ignores the role played\nby emotions, desires and the will in coming to faith (Hasker 2002:\n257\u2013258). Is belief in a divine revelation only a matter of\nBayesian calculation of probabilities? This lacuna in\nSwinburne\u2019s thought\u2014as well as in much evidentialist\nreflection in general\u2014has been addressed by Paul Moser, who\nintroduces an existential-affective dimension in the inferential\nproject. His central claim is that our access to evidence for\nGod\u2019s existence might depend on our volitional and affective\nstates (2008; 2010. See also Wainwright 2006).\n\nMoser believes that God is \u201chidden\u201d, at least for some\npeople some of the time, in the sense that his existence is not beyond\nreasonable doubt. This fact should not be taken as a reason for\nskepticism, however, since it is to be expected that a perfectly\nloving God would only make evidence of his existence available when\nthis is likely to elicit the right human response. God does not reveal\nhimself simply in order to slake our curiosity, but only with the\npurpose of accomplishing, in a non-coercive way, a moral\ntransformation of humans to align their wills and character with\nGod\u2019s character and purposes. We should hence expect evidence\nfor God to be purposively available.\n\nMoser claims that his emphasis on the volitional element in our\nepistemic responses to divine revelation constitutes \u201ca\nCopernican Revolution in cognitive matters about God\u2019s\nexistence\u201d (2008: 4). However, it would be more accurate to say\nthat he revives a classical theme, found in the church fathers and\nAquinas (Macdonald 2009a: 137). For Aquinas, for example, it is the\nwill that moves the intellect to the assent of faith (as emphasized by\nthe \u201cvoluntarist interpretation\u201d, see\n section 2.1\n above).\n\nAnother philosopher who stresses the personal dimension of faith and\nits epistemic relevance is Abraham, who notes that revelation is a\n\u201cthreshold concept\u201d. By accepting a revelatory claim,\none\u2019s perception of the world changes in a fundamental way. This\nis a \u201cprofoundly self-involving experience\u201d and a\n\u201cmassive cognitive and spiritual revolution\u201d (Abraham\n2006: 87, 89). \n2.3.4 Hybridism\n\nFinally, it must be considered whether a \u201chybrid\u201d approach\nto revelatory claims\u2014combining inferential and non-inferential\nmodes of justification\u2014might be fruitful. Abraham (2006 and\n1982) suggests that this is the case. Inspired by Plantinga\u2019s\ntheory of a sensus divinitatis, Abraham claims that we come\nequipped with an oculus contemplationis, \u201ca\nspiritually discerning eye\u201d that allows us to discern\nGod\u2019s presence and activity in nature and history through a\n\u201cbasic cognitive act\u201d (2006: 69). \n\nHowever, Abraham considers arguments from evidence to be\n\u201csupplementary to the appeal to the oculus\ncontemplationis\u201d. Miracles, for example, have a genuine\nepistemic freight and the kind of data appealed to in evidentialist\nreasoning about revelation can \n\n\noperate as corroborating evidence that coheres with and thus\nstrengthens the initial beliefs legitimately formed independently of\npropositional evidence. (2006: 72, 77)\n\n\nAbraham\u2019s portrayal of revelation as a \u201cthreshold\nconcept\u201d also seems to open up the possibility of a kind of\n\u201cretroactive\u201d justification: Once a revelatory claim has\nbeen accepted, the new perspective one has gained will make one\ncapable of seeing the cognitive errors of one\u2019s previous\nposition. Charles Taylor has described this kind of retroactive\njustification as a \u201csupersession argument\u201d (2005:\n340\u2013341).\n2.4 Sui Generis Approaches\n\nA possibility (or purported possibility) that has not been considered\nso far, is that belief in divine revelation could be justified in a\nway that is totally sui generis. Inspired by Kierkegaard,\nKarl Barth seems to suggest something like this. Human nature is not\nin any way adapted to receive knowledge of God, according to Barth,\nand hence there can be no philosophical explanation of how knowledge\nof God comes about. However, God himself could provide such knowledge\nwithout respecting the criteria of any epistemological canon. Barth\nwriters:\n\n\nTo say \u201cGod with us\u201d is to say something which has no\nbasis or possibility outside itself, which can in no sense be\nexplained in terms of man and man\u2019s situation, but only as\nknowledge of God from God, as free and unmerited grace. As the Bible\nbears witness to God\u2019s revelation and as Church proclamation\ntakes up this witness in obedience, both renounce any foundation apart\nfrom that which God has given once and for all by speaking (Barth\n1975: 119\u2013120).\n\n\nCritics have accused Barth of portraying revelation \n\n\nas something having full authority over the insights of reason and\nsensibility, and as not in any way subject to them. (Quash 2007: 334)\n\n\n\nAccording to Pannenberg, this is equivalent to fideism. \n\n\nBarth\u2019s apparently so lofty objectivity about God and\nGod\u2019s word turns out to rest on no more than the irrational\nsubjectivity of a venture of faith with no justification outside\nitself. (1976: 273)\n\n\nIn response to this kind of criticism, theologians in the\n\u201cpostliberal\u201d tradition (inspired by Barth) have argued\nthat revelation is not an epistemological concept at all. The\nChristian doctrine of revelation does not purport to explain how\nChristina beliefs are justified. Instead, it provides an\nintra-theological explication of God\u2019s prevenient grace\n(Thiemann 1985: 4). Some have even gone so far as to say that\n\u201cthe very idea that the Bible is revealed \u2026 is a claim\nthat creates more trouble than it is worth\u201d (Hauerwas 1981: 57).\nFor postliberal theologians in general, Christian beliefs are\njustified by being part of a coherent web of beliefs (Marshall\n2000).\n\nHowever, perhaps a better way of defending Barth is suggested by Hans\nUrs von Balthasar. He shares Barth\u2019s general view of revelation\nas epistemically self-authenticating and as providing its own warrant,\nindependently of human preconceptions (Chapp 2004: 11). However,\nBalthasar attempts to make this view intelligible by suggesting an\nanalogy with aesthetic experience. In Mozart\u2019s Jupiter\nSymphony, for example, every note seems to be necessary in the\nsense that any change would make the symphony less beautiful. However,\nnobody (except Mozart himself) could have said in advance that\nprecisely this combination of notes is necessary in order to\nproduce such beauty. Hence, our recognition of the beauty or\nperfection of the symphony happens without reference to any criteria\nor rules that we could have stated independently of encountering the\nsymphony itself. In a similar way, revelation possesses its own\nintrinsic credibility, rooted in the self-authenticating glory of God.\n\u201cDivine love\u201d, writes Balthasar, \n\n\ncan appear in such an overwhelming way that its glorious majesty\nthrows one to the ground; it shines out as the last word and leaves\none no choice but to respond in the mode of pure, blind obedience.\n(Balthasar 2004: 53, 57) \n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abraham, William J., 1981, <em>The Divine Inspiration of Holy\nScripture</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1982, <em>Divine Revelation and the Limits\nof Historical Criticism</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1997, \u201cRevelation Reaffirmed\u201d,\nin Avis 1997, pp. 201\u2013215.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002, \u201cThe Offense of Divine\nRevelation\u201d, <em>Harvard Theological Review</em>, 95(3):\n251\u2013264. doi:10.1017/S0017816002000160", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, <em>Crossing the Threshold of Divine\nRevelation</em>, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans.", "Adeel, M.
