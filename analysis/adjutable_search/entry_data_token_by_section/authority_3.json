And this is certainly the most prominent and striking\nexercise of authority.  But political authorities do not only create\nduties in others in and some cases do not purport to create such\nduties at all.  The most prominent instances of this can be found in\ninternational institutions.  The Security Council of the United\nNations exercises authority in a variety of ways: sometimes acting as\na kind of legislative body and sometimes acting as a kind of executive\nbody.  Its executive authority is its traditional role in\ninternational law.  But this executive authority is quite distinct\nfrom the kind of executive authority we see in the state.  The\nSecurity Council exercises its executive authority primarily by\nauthorizing actions and not by carrying them out by itself or by\nrequiring them.  One way to describe the moral power of the Security\nCouncil is that it gives a liberty to states to prosecute wars.  It\ndoes this against a background of a general prohibition of all war\nexcept in the case of self-defense.  It suspends that prohibition for\ncertain states.  It does not require them to act, it only permits them\nto act in a warlike way.  This is because the agent of enforcement in\nthe international system is a decentralized one.\n\n\nFurthermore the Dispute Settlement Mechanism of the World Trade\nOrganization functions in very much the same way.  The dispute\nsettlement system first determines whether a state has in fact\nviolated its agreements on trade and tariffs with another state.  And\nwhen it determines this, it permits the plaintiff state to act in a\nway that would normally be in violation of its agreements.  It permits\nretaliation through the system of tariffs and non-tariff barriers.  It\ncannot require this retaliation.\n  \n\nHence the two most effective and authoritative institutions in the\ninternational system do not impose duties at all in many cases, they\nexercise a moral power to alter the moral situation of states but the\nalteration is from duty to permission in many cases.  To be sure, they\ndo this against the background of treaties and agreements that have a\nkind of legislative force and that do purport to impose genuine\nduties.  And there are duties not to interfere with the authorized\nactivity, but the point remains that the primary exercise is one of\nchanging duties to permissions.  This may confirm Applebaum's idea\nthat authority need not impose duties.\n",
