    "main_text": "Causation and Free Action\n3. Causation and Free Action\n\nAs we have seen, Menzies and Price assign a central role to\n\u201cfree action\u201d in the elucidation of causation. They do not\nfurther explain what they mean by this phrase, preferring instead, as\nthe passage quoted above indicates, to point to a characteristic\nexperience we have as agents. It seems clear, however, that whether\n(as soft determinists would have it) a free action is understood as an\naction that is uncoerced or unconstrained or due to voluntary choices\nof the agent, or whether, as libertarians would have it, a free action\nis an action that is uncaused or not deterministically caused, the\npersistence of a correlation between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) when \\(A\\) is\nrealized as a \u201cfree act\u201d is not sufficient for\n\\(A\\) to cause \\(B\\). Suppose , in the example described above, the\nposition of the barometer dial \\(X\\) is set by a free act (in either\nof the above senses) of the experimenter but that this free act (and\nhence \\(X)\\) is correlated with \\(Z\\), the variable measuring\natmospheric pressure, perhaps because the experimenter observes the\natmospheric pressure and freely chooses to set \\(X\\) in a way that is\ncorrelated with \\(Z\\). (This possibility is compatible with the\nexperimenter\u2019s act of setting \\(X\\) being free in either of the\nabove two senses.) In this case, \\(X\\) will remain correlated with\n\\(Y\\) when produced by a free act, even though \\(X\\) does not cause\n\\(Y\\). Suppose, then, that we respond to this difficulty by adding to\nour characterization of \\(A\\)\u2019s being realized by a free act the\nidea that this act must not itself be correlated with any other cause\nof \\(A\\). (Passages in Price 1991 suggest such an additional proviso,\nalthough the condition in question seems to have nothing to do with\nthe usual understanding of free action.) Even with this proviso, it\nneed not be the case that \\(A\\) causes \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) remains\ncorrelated with \\(B\\) when \\(A\\) is produced by an act that is free in\nthis sense, since it still remains possible that the free act that\nproduces \\(A\\) also causes \\(B\\) via a route that does not go through\n\\(A\\). As an illustration, consider a case in which an\nexperimenter\u2019s administration of a drug to a treatment group (by\ninducing patients to ingest it) has a placebo effect that enhances\nrecovery, even though the drug itself has no effect on recovery. There\nis a correlation between ingestion of the drug and recovery that\npersists under the experimenter\u2019s free act of administering the\ndrug even though ingestion of the drug does not cause recovery.\n",
