    "main_text": "Considerations in Favor of Scientific Realism (and Responses) || The Miracle Argument\n2.1 The Miracle Argument\n\nThe most powerful intuition motivating realism is an old idea,\ncommonly referred to in recent discussions as the \u201cmiracle\nargument\u201d or \u201cno miracles argument\u201d, after\nPutnam\u2019s (1975a: 73) claim that realism \u201cis the only\nphilosophy that doesn\u2019t make the success of science a\nmiracle\u201d. The argument begins with the widely accepted premise\nthat our best theories are extraordinarily successful: they facilitate\nempirical predictions, retrodictions, and explanations of the subject\nmatters of scientific investigation, often marked by astounding\naccuracy and intricate causal manipulations of the relevant phenomena.\nWhat explains this success? One explanation, favored by realists, is\nthat our best theories are true (or approximately true, or correctly\ndescribe a mind-independent world of entities, laws, etc.). Indeed, if\nthese theories were far from the truth, so the argument goes, the fact\nthat they are so successful would be miraculous. And given the choice\nbetween a straightforward explanation of success and a miraculous\nexplanation, clearly one should prefer the non-miraculous explanation,\nviz. that our best theories are approximately true (etc.).\n(For elaborations of the miracle argument, see J. Brown 1982; Boyd\n1989; Lipton 1994; Psillos 1999: ch. 4; Barnes 2002; Lyons 2003; Busch\n2008; Frost-Arnold 2010; and Dells\u00e9n 2016.)\n\nThough intuitively powerful, the miracle argument is contestable in a\nnumber of ways. One skeptical response is to question the very need\nfor an explanation of the success of science in the first place. For\nexample, van Fraassen (1980: 40; see also Wray 2007, 2010) suggests\nthat successful theories are analogous to well-adapted\norganisms\u2014since only successful theories (organisms) survive, it\nis hardly surprising that our theories are successful, and therefore,\nthere is no demand here for an explanation of success. It is not\nentirely clear, however, whether the evolutionary analogy is\nsufficient to dissolve the intuition behind the miracle argument. One\nmight wonder, for instance, why a particular theory is\nsuccessful (as opposed to why theories in general are successful), and\nthe explanation sought may turn on specific features of the theory\nitself, including its descriptions of unobservables. Whether such\nexplanations need be true, though, is a matter of debate. While most\ntheories of explanation require that the explanans be true,\npragmatic theories of explanation do not (van Fraassen 1980: ch. 5).\nMore generally, any epistemology of science that does not accept one\nor more of the three dimensions of realism\u2014commitment to a\nmind-independent world, literal semantics, and epistemic access to\nunobservables\u2014will thereby present a putative reason for\nresisting the miracle argument. These positions are considered in\n section 4.\n\nSome authors contend that the miracle argument is, in fact, an\ninstance of fallacious reasoning called the base rate fallacy (Howson\n2000: ch. 3; Lipton [1991] 2004: 196\u2013198; Magnus & Callender\n2004). Consider the following illustration. There is a test for a\ndisease for which the rate of false negatives (negative results in\ncases where the disease is present) is zero, and the rate of false\npositives (positive results in cases where the disease is absent) is\none in ten (that is, disease-free individuals test positive 10% of the\ntime). If one tests positive, what are the chances that one has the\ndisease? It would be a mistake to conclude that, based on the rate of\nfalse positives, the probability is 90%, for the actual probability\ndepends on some further, crucial information: the base rate of the\ndisease in the population (the proportion of people having it). The\nlower the incidence of the disease at large, the lower the probability\nthat a positive result signals the presence of the disease.\n\nBy analogy, using the success of a scientific theory as an indicator\nof its approximate truth (assuming a low rate of false\npositives\u2014cases in which theories far from the truth are\nnonetheless successful) is arguably, likewise, an instance of the base\nrate fallacy. The success of a theory does not by itself suggest that\nit is likely approximately true, and since there is no independent way\nof knowing the base rate of approximately true theories, the chances\nof it being approximately true cannot be assessed. Worrall (unpublished,\nOther Internet Resources) maintains that these contentions are\nineffective against the miracle argument because they crucially depend\non a misleading formalization of it in terms of probabilities\n(cf. Menke 2014; for a criticism of the miracle argument based on a\ndifferent probabilistic framing in terms of likelihoods, see Sober\n2015: 912\u2013915).\n",
