    "main_text": "Philosophy, Philosophers, and Rhetoric || Philosophical works\n2.1 Philosophical works\n\nOn the meaning of philosophy for Philo, see see the supplement on\n The Meanings of Philosophy in Philo of Alexandria.\n His five philosophical works are De providentia 1 and 2,\nDe animalibus, De aeternitate and Quod omnis\nprobus. The two latter works are the only ones for which we have\nGreek texts. With the exception of a few rare references to the Bible,\nthese texts could well have been written by a pagan philosopher. This\nis why some scholars thought they were products of Philo\u2019s\npaideia, his classical Greek education. Today, there is a\ntendency to believe that Philo\u2019s extant texts were written near\nthe end of his life. If this is the case, the reason for writing, in\nthe atmosphere of great cultural and political rivalry of the epoch,\ncould have been to demonstrate that a Jew was as able to compose a\nphilosophy as \u201cpure\u201d as any Greek. In any case, the most\ndiscussed problem today is the skepticism regarding the authenticity\nof the De aeternitate, the treatise in which we find the most\nexplicit references to philosophy and philosophers. Since\nRunia\u2019s seminal article in 1981, a majority of scholars seems to\nhave distanced themselves from thinking the text is inauthentic. For\nRunia, there is no contradiction in the fact that Philo goes against\nthe biblical tradition and defends the eternity of the world not only\nin the future but also in the past. The second part of Philo\u2019s\ntreatise, now lost, would have contained the refutation of this\nunorthodox\u2014at least from a Jewish point of view\u2014thesis. It\nis probable that Philo, who seems to have had good knowledge of\nskeptical methods, was trained to argue both pro and\ncontra of a thesis, a dialectical technique of which the\nDe aeternitate is probably the best illustration. We will\nreturn to the question of the authenticity in the supplemenary\ndocument\n About the De aeternitate and the De providentia.\n",
