    "main_text": "Descartes\n3. Descartes\n\nThe issues are, however, far more explicit in the entry on\n Descartes\u2019 physics;\n and since the form of his theory is different, the \u2018kinds of\nmotion\u2019 in question are quite different \u2013 as they change\nwith all the different theories that we discuss. For Descartes argued\nin his 1644 Principles of Philosophy (see Book II) that the\nessence of matter is extension (i.e., size and shape), because any\nother attribute of bodies could be imagined away without imagining\naway matter itself. But he also held that extension constitutes the\nnature of space, and hence he concluded that space and matter are one\nand the same thing. An immediate consequence of the identification is\nthe impossibility of the vacuum; if every region of space is a region\nof matter, then there can be no space without matter. Thus\nDescartes\u2019 universe is \u2018hydrodynamical\u2019 \u2013\ncompletely full of mobile matter of different sized pieces in motion,\nrather like a bucket full of water and lumps of ice of different\nsizes, which has been stirred around. Since fundamentally the pieces\nof matter are nothing but extension, the universe is in fact nothing\nbut a system of geometric bodies in motion without any\n gaps.[1]\n",
