It is recognized\ntoday, however, that at best Frege showed that arithmetic is reducible\nto second-order logic extended only by Hume\u2019s Principle. Some\nphilosophers think Hume\u2019s Principle is analytically true (i.e., true\nin virtue of the very meanings of its words), while others resist the\nclaim, and there is an interesting debate on this issue in the\nliterature (see, e.g., Boolos 1997, Wright 1999).\nHowever, for the purposes of this introduction to Frege\u2019s work,\nthere are prior questions on which it is more important to\nfocus. Whereas Frege thought that the truths of arithmetic are\nderivable from analytic truths of logic, Kant thought arithmetic\nprinciples are synthetic, in which case they wouldn\u2019t be derivable\nfrom analytic truths.  Their different conceptions of logic helps to\nexplain why these two philosophers came to such different conclusions.\nIn this section, we therefore turn to the following questions:\n\nHow did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from Kant\u2019s?\nIn particular:\nWhat resources (or laws) did Kant and Frege both consider to be\n logical?\nDid Kant and Frege agree about the content and \nsubject matter of logic?\n\nHow did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from that of\nlater logicians?\n\n\nAn answer to the first question sets the stage for answering the\nsecond. \n2.7.1 How Frege\u2019s Conception of Logic Differed from Kant\u2019s\n\nOne of the most important differences between Kant and Frege concerns\nthe resources available to logic. Kant\u2019s logic is limited to (a)\nAristotelian term logic with a simple theory of disjunctive and\nhypothetical propositions, and (b) representing inclusion relations\namong concepts (MacFarlane 2002, 26). By contrast, Frege\u2019s logic\nincludes (a) a term-forming operator \\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}\\), which\nallows one to form the singular term\n\\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon)\\) from the function expression\n\\(f(\\xi)\\), and (b) a Rule of Substitution, which allows one to\nsubstitute complex open formulas for free second-order variables in\ntheorems of logic but also allows one to define, and assert the\nexistence of, complex concepts, including concepts defined in terms of\nquantifiers over concepts.  We\u2019ll discuss both of these\nresources below, but first, the discussion needs some context.\n\nThe differences concerning the resources available to logic revolve\naround a key issue, namely, whether the additional resources Frege\nassigns to logic require an appeal to non-logical constructions,\nspecifically to a faculty of \u2018intuition\u2019, that is, an\nextralogical source which presents our minds with phenomena about\nwhich judgments can be formed.  (Recall the discussion above about\nFrege\u2019s early interest in appeals to intuition.)  The debate\nover which resources do and do not require an appeal to intuition is\nan important one. Frege continued a trend started by Bolzano (1817),\nwho eliminated the appeal to intuition in the proof of the\nIntermediate Value Theorem in the calculus (which in its simplest form\nasserts that a continuous function having both positive and negative\nvalues must cross the origin). Bolzano proved this theorem from the\ndefinition of continuity, which had recently been given in terms\nsimilar to the definition of a limit (see Coffa 1991, 27). A Kantian\nmight simply draw a graph of a continuous function which takes values\nabove and below the origin, and thereby \u2018demonstrate\u2019 that\nsuch a function must cross the origin.  But appeal to a graph involves\nan appeal to intuition, and both Bolzano and Frege saw such appeals to\nintuition as potentially introducing logical gaps into a proof. There\nare reasons to be suspicious about such appeals: (1) there are\nfunctions which we can\u2019t graph or otherwise construct for\npresentation to our intuitive faculty, e.g., the function \\(f\\) which\nmaps rational numbers to \\(0\\) and irrational numbers to \\(1\\), or the\nfunctions noted by Weierstrass, which are everywhere continuous but\nnowhere differentiable; (2) once we take certain intuitive notions and\nformalize them in terms of explicit definitions, the formal definition\nmight imply counterintuitive results; and (3) the rules of inference\nfrom statements to constructions and back are not always clear.\n\nFrege dedicated himself to the idea of eliminating appeals to\nintuition in the proofs of the basic propositions of arithmetic.  He\nexplicitly remarked upon this fact in a number of works throughout his\ncareer (1879, Preface/5, Part III/\u00a723; 1884, \u00a7\u00a762, 87;\n1893, \u00a70; and 1903, Appendix). Thus, he would deny Kant\u2019s\ndictum (A51 [B75]), \u2018Without sensibility, no object would be\ngiven to us\u2019, and claim instead that \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) are objects\nbut that they \u2018can\u2019t be given to us in sensation\u2019\n(1884, 101). Frege\u2019s view is that we can understand or grasp\nthem as objects if we (a) define them as extensions of concepts, and\n(b) show that singular terms of the form\n\\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon)\\) can be axiomatized by an analytic\nproposition. (The latter was to be accomplished by Basic Law V, and so\nthe collapse of this law in light of Russell\u2019s paradox\nundermined this part of his plan for avoiding appeals to\nintuition.)\n\nMoreover, philosophers have questioned whether Frege\u2019s Rule of\nSubstitution (Grundgesetze I, 1893, \u00a748, item 9) also\nrequired an appeal to intuition. The Rule of Substitution allows one\nto substitute complex formulas for free second-order variables in\nlogical theorems to produce new logical theorems. Boolos argued (1985,\n336\u2013338) that since Frege\u2019s Rule of Substitution is\nequivalent to a Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it is\nextralogical in character. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts \\(\\exists F \\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\phi)\\), provided \\(\\phi\\)\ndoesn\u2019t have a free variable \\(F\\); the proviso blocks the\ninstance \\(\\exists F\\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\neg Fx)\\), from which one can\nquickly derive a contradiction. Thus, the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts asserts the existence of a concept corresponding to every\nexpressible condition on objects. From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nsuch existence claims were thought to be synthetic and in need of\njustification by the faculty of intuition. So, although it was one of\nFrege\u2019s goals to avoid appeals to the faculty of intuition,\nthere is a question as to whether his system of second-order logic\n(minus Basic Law V), which implies a principle asserting the existence\nof a wide range of concepts, really is limited in its scope to purely\nlogical laws of an analytic nature.\n\nIf we now put aside their differences about logic\u2019s resources\nand the appeal to intuition, there are other ways in which the Kantian\nand Fregean conceptions of logic differ.  Both MacFarlane (2002) and\nLinnebo (2003) point out that one of Kant\u2019s central views about\nlogic is that its axioms and theorems are purely formal in nature\n(i.e., abstracted from all semantic content and concerned only with\nthe forms of judgments) and are applicable across all the\nphysical and mathematical sciences (1781 [1787], A55 [B79], A56 [B80],\nA70 [B95]; and 1800, 15).  And Kant takes the laws of logic to be\nnormative and prescriptive (something one can get wrong), and not just\ndescriptive (1800, 16); they provide constitutive norms of\nthought (MacFarlane 2002, 35; Tolley 2008).  Indeed, Linnebo takes two\ntheses, that logic is formal and provides laws that are constitutive\nnorms of thought, to be distinctive of Kant\u2019s conception\n(Linnebo 2003, 240).\n\nBy contrast, Frege rejects the idea that logic is a purely formal\nenterprise (MacFarlane 2002, 29; Linnebo 2003, 243). He took logic to\nhave its own unique subject matter, which included not only facts\nabout concepts (concerning negation, subsumption, etc.) and identity,\nbut also facts about relations (e.g., their properties and\nancestrals). Frege (1906, 428 [1984, 338]) says:\n\nJust as the concept point belongs to geometry, so logic, too, has its\nown concepts and relations; and it is only in virtue of this that it\ncan have a content. Toward what is thus proper to it, its relation is\nnot at all formal. No science is completely formal; but even\ngravitational mechanics is formal to a certain degree, in so far as\noptical and chemical properties are all the same to it. \u2026 To\nlogic, for example, there belong the following: negation, identity,\nsubsumption, subordination of concepts.\n\nAnd, of course, as we\u2019ve seen, Frege supposed that there is a domain\nof special logical objects (courses of values), among which\nhe defined, and \u2013 until confronted by Russell\u2019s paradox \u2013\ntook himself to have proved facts about, extensions\nand natural numbers (1884, 1893/1903).  Logic, then, is not\npurely formal, from Frege\u2019s point of view, but rather can provide\nsubstantive knowledge of concepts and objects.\n\nThere is some question, however, as to the extent to which Frege took\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought.  Linnebo suggests that\nFrege eventually rejected this idea. Though he offers various\narguments for thinking that Frege moved away from the constitutivity\nthesis, his [Linnebo\u2019s] main argument concerns the fact that Frege\nwanted to position Basic Law V as a logical claim, but that Basic Law\nV doesn\u2019t seem to be a constitutive norm of thought (Linnebo 2003,\n247).  This is a persuasive reason, though it does make one wonder\nwhat Frege could have meant, in the second volume\nof Grundgesetze (\u00a7147), when he said, concerning Basic\nLaw V:\n\nIf there are logical objects at all \u2026 then there must also be a\nmeans of apprehending, or recognizing them. This \u2026 is performed\n\u2026 by the fundamental law of logic that permits the\ntransformation of an equality holding generally\n\\([\\forall x(f(x)\\! =\\! g(x))]\\) into an\nequation\n\\([\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon) = \\sm{\\alpha}g(\\alpha)]\\).\n[Author\u2019s note: the equations in brackets were added for the sake of\nclarity.] \n\nGiven Frege\u2019s commitment to logical objects as part of the\ncontent of logic, the above passage suggests that he might have\nregarded the law which transformed an equality holding generally into\nan equation as a constitutive norm of thought.\n\nBut many Frege scholars are convinced that Frege took the laws of\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought (MacFarlane 2002,\nTaschek 2008, Steinberger 2017).  MacFarlane, in particular, argues\nthat Kant and Frege may have agreed that one of the most important\ncharacteristics of logic is its generality, and that this generality\nconsists in the fact that it provides normative rules and\nprescriptions. He notes that \u201c[t]he generality of logic, for\nFrege as for Kant, is a normative generality: logic is\ngeneral in the sense that it provides constitutive norms for\nthought as such, regardless of its subject matter\u201d\n(2002, 35). So, though they may differ as to which principles are\nlogical, there may be at least one point of reconciliation concerning\nhow Kant and Frege conceived of logic. \n2.7.2 How Frege\u2019s Conception Differed from Later Logicians\n\nGiven the constraints of the present entry, we shall not attempt to\ndiscuss this question in any detail; instead, we present only the\nbarest of outlines. After all, modern logicians and philosophers of\nlogic have not yet come to agreement about the proper conception of\nlogic.  Many have a conception of logic that is yet different from\nboth Kant\u2019s and Frege\u2019s, one that was, to some extent,\nanticipated by Bolzano, namely, that logical concepts and laws remain\ninvariant under reinterpretation of the non-logical constants or under\npermutations of the domain of quantification. But since this modern\nconception is still a matter of debate, it may be that elements of\nFrege\u2019s conception will yet play a role in our understanding of\nwhat logic is.\nIt is important to recognize just how much Frege took himself to be\nfocusing on the content, as opposed to the form, of\nthoughts. His concern to more precisely represent the content of\nthoughts is stated explicitly in an 1882 lecture before Jena\u2019s\nSociety for Medicine and Natural Science, where he distinguished his\n1879 system from Boole\u2019s logic by saying:\nI was not trying to present an abstract logic in formulas;\nI was trying to express contents in an exacter and more perspicuous\nmanner than is possible in words, by using written symbols. I was\ntrying, in fact, to create a \u201clingua\ncharacteristica\u201d in the Leibnizian sense, not a mere\n\u201ccalculus ratiocinator\u201d\u2014not that I do not\nrecognize such a deductive calculus as a necessary constituent of a\nBegriffsschrift.  [Frege 1882, V.H. Dudman (trans.)\n1968] \n\nSo Frege was not just trying to develop an abstract reasoning system\nfor the precise derivations of theorems from axioms (see van\nHeijenoort 1967 for discussion).  Frege was at least as interested in\nformalizing the content of reasoning as he was in formulating\nthe rules for deriving a given thought from some group of\nthoughts. Frege would not have regarded the logical axioms of\nhis formal systems as axiom schemata, i.e., as a\nmetalinguistic sentence patterns whose instances (i.e., the sentences\nof the object language that match the pattern) are axioms (see\nGoldfarb 2001 for discussion). Nor would he have agreed that the\nlogical axioms of his system were uninterpreted sentences. His unease\nwith the modern conception of an uninterpreted formal system was\nexpressed in his reaction to Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of\nGeometry (Frege 1906, 384 [1984, 315]):\n\nThe word \u2018interpretation\u2019 is objectionable, for when\nproperly expressed, a thought leaves no room for different\ninterpretations. We have seen that ambiguity simply has to be rejected\n\u2026\n\nInstead, Frege thought that his logical axioms are (a) fundamental\ntruths governing negation, conditionalization, quantification,\nidentity, and description, and (b) principles from which other such\nfundamental truths could be derived. Indeed, even though Frege\nsometimes introduces methods for abbreviating these truths, he takes\ngreat pains to insist that these abbreviations are to be understood in\nterms of the full content being expressed.  For example, he summarizes\nthe law of universal instantiation (Basic Law IIa) in 1893/\u00a747\nusing a formula that we would write nowadays as:\n\n\\(\\forall xFx \\to Fy\\)\n\n\nBut closer inspection of \u00a720, where this principle is first\ndiscussed, and of \u00a717, where he introduces some notational\nconventions used in \u00a720, makes it clear that the above is\nshorthand for:\n\n\\(\\forall F \\forall y(\\forall xFx \\to Fy)\\)\n\n\nThis latter is a sentence; it is not a schema, nor an open formula\nwith a free variable, nor an uninterpreted sentence.  Rather it\nasserts something that Frege takes to be fundamental law, namely: for\nany property \\(F\\) and for any object \\(y\\), if everything\nfalls under \\(F\\), then \\(y\\) falls under \\(F\\).\n\nFrege\u2019s understanding of, and attitude towards, the formulas of\nhis formal language goes a long way towards explaining why his\nposition, in the now famous debate with Hilbert about the status of\nthe axioms in a formal system, is not an unreasonable one. At first\nglance, it looks as if Frege has mistakenly challenged Hilbert\u2019s\nmethod of relative interpretability, whereby one can prove the\nconsistency and independence of axiom systems by re-intepreting, and\nthereby reducing, them to systems assumed to be\nconsistent. Frege\u2019s objections about what exactly has been\nestablished by these relative consistency proofs may seem misguided to\na modern ear.  But since Frege and Hilbert understood the notions\nof consistency and independence differently, they\ndidn\u2019t always directly engage with the other\u2019s ideas.\nBlanchette nicely shows, both in the entry on the\n  Frege-Hilbert controversy and in her\nbook (2012, Ch. 5), that if the notions of consistency and\nindependence are understood Hilbert\u2019s way, then Hilbert\u2019s\nmethods do establish what he says they do, but that if these notions\nare understood Frege\u2019s way, they don\u2019t. The reader should pursue\nthese works for a more detailed explanation and nuanced discussion of\nthe disagreement.\n\nOne can appreciate how Frege and Hilbert might have failed to engage\nwith one another by considering a simple analogy.  Consider the\ninference from \u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d to \u201c\\(x\\) had\na dream\u201d and ask the question, is the latter a logical\nconsequence of the former? If one examines the inference purely\nformally, as Hilbert might, then the sentences have the form\n\u2018\\(Fx\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(Gx\\)\u2019 and the question\nbecomes, does \\(Fx\\) logically imply \\(Gx\\)?  The answer for Hilbert\nwould be \u2018No\u2019, because one can interpret\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 in such a way that the\ninference fails, e.g., just assign the standard meaning of\n\u2018dream\u2019 to \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 and assign the standard\nmeaning of \u2018nightmare\u2019 to \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019, i.e.,\ninterpret \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 as the property having a dream\nand interpret \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 as the property having a\nnightmare. This shows that, from this purely formal point of\nview, \u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d doesn\u2019t logically\nimply \u201c\\(x\\) had a dream\u201d. (From this purely formal\nviewpoint, one additionally needs the premise \\(\\forall y(Fy \\to Gy)\\)\nto infer \\(Gx\\) from \\(Fx\\).)\n\nAlthough Frege had a formal system in which the open sentence \\(Fx\\)\ndoesn\u2019t logically imply \\(Gx\\), he takes logical consequence to\nbe a relation among thoughts. He wouldn\u2019t answer the\nquestion, of whether one thought is a logical consequence of another,\nsolely by looking at the form of the sentences that express them, but\nrather by looking at the content of those sentences. Given the meaning\n(content) that \u2018nightmare\u2019 and \u2018dream\u2019 in fact\nhave, \u201c\\(x\\) had a dream\u201d is a logical consequence of\n\u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d, for having a nightmare,\ni.e., having a bad dream, logically implies having a\ndream. So, for Frege, this would clearly be a case of logical\nconsequence.\n\nThis analogy might help one to see how Frege and Hilbert might differ\nin their approach to questions of consistency and interpretation.  On\nFrege\u2019s view, the consistency of a group of axioms depends on\ncontent, and if the form of these axioms, under logical analysis,\nsufficiently captures their content, this consistency will be\ninherited by their formal representations as well.  Of course, in\nproving consistency, Hilbert was concerned primarily to determine\nwhether an axiom system entailed a contradiction having the form\n\\(\\phi \\amp \\neg \\phi\\).  So, given this formal goal,\nHilbert\u2019s methods are useful and immune to criticism.\n\nBut this brings us to one final issue that is crucial to Frege\u2019s\nconception of logic, namely, the extent to which his formal\nrepresentations capture the content of the claims being\nanalyzed. This issue is relevant because Frege\u2019s primary tool for\nanalyzing the content of a mathematical or philosophical claim is by\nway of representing the content in a system that axiomatizes\nthe fundamental concepts that are needed for the analysis.  This issue\nis the subject of the first half of Blanchette 2012. To see what is at\nstake, we vary the example from the one used in Blanchette 2012\n(24). Frege would represent the arithmetical law:\n\nNo (natural) number precedes zero\n\nin the first instance, as:\n\n \\( \\neg \\exists x(\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,0)) \\)\n\nThen if we substitute Frege\u2019s definitions of\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\), \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\), and \\(0\\), as\ndescribed in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 above, his representation of the\narithmetical law becomes:\n\n \\(\\neg \\exists x((x\\! =\\! 0 \\lor \\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,x)) \\amp \\\\ \\\n    \\ \\ \\exists F \\exists z(Fz \\amp 0\\! =\\! \\#F \\amp x\\! =\\!\n    \\#[\\lambda u \\: Fu \\amp u \\! \\neq\\! z])) \\)\n\n\nThough the formal representation could be taken further, if we expand\nthe definitions of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\), \\(\\#F\\), and \\(\\#[\\lambda\nu \\: Fu \\amp u \\!\\neq\\! z]\\), enough has been said to pose the\nquestion: why think that by deriving the formal representation from\nmore fundamental principles, Frege has derived the arithmetic law that\nno natural number precedes Zero?  This question is tackled in some\ndetail in in the early part of Blanchette 2012, which investigates\nFrege\u2019s understanding of conceptual analysis. Her answer\n(Chapter 4) is that the formal representation of the arithmetic law\nhas to be (self-evidently) logically equivalent to a good analysis of\nthe original. If it is, then notwithstanding Frege\u2019s failed\nreduction of numbers to extensions, a derivation of the formal\nrepresentation from more general logical laws of the kind represented\nin his system would have in fact achieved the goal of reducing\narithmetic to logic. The reader is directed to her work for discussion\nof this important point.\n",
