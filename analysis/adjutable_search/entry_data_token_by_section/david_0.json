    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nByzantium in the 6th century witnessed at once a last flourishing and\na dramatic decline of the tradition of composing philosophical\ncommentaries on the works of Plato and Aristotle, a tradition which\nbegan in earnest in the 2nd century CE. David, together with the\nalmost equally enigmatic Elias, and Stephanus, belong to the final stage\nof this tradition that reached its pinnacle in the 6th century\u2019s first\nhalf with the great commentaries of Ammonius Hermeiou and his pupils\nSimplicius and John Philoponus in the East, and with Boethius in the\nWest. If we discount a commentary on the Categories which the\nmanuscript tradition uniformly attributes to \u2018David\u2019 but\nwhich, in style and doctrine, is more closely related to works\nattributed to \u2018Elias\u2019, there remain two texts we have to\nconsider as his works, one entitled \u2018Prolegomena\nphilosophiae\u2019 (\u2018Introduction to Philosophy\u2019), the\nother lectures on Porphyry\u2019s \u2018Introduction to Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories\u2019. The author of these texts refers to\nOlympiodorus four times; he may have been his pupil. Olympiodorus, who\nwas a pagan, held the chair of philosophy at Alexandria as a successor\nto Ammonius and Eutocius for well over 30 years, from around 530 to\nabout 565. These are the only pieces of evidence that provide us with\na rough estimate as to the time of composition.\n2. Extant Writings\n\n\nBoth the \u2018Introduction to Philosophy\u2019 and the commentary\non Porphyry arose out of the author\u2019s teaching activity, presumably at\nthe school of Alexandria. The text is divided throughout into more or\nless self-contained \u2018lectures,\u2019 called\n\u2018praxeis,\u2019 a formal structure that was first used by\nOlympiodorus. The \u2018Introduction to Philosophy\u2019 consists of\n24 such lectures. In fact, the texts we have state in their title that\nthey were written down \u201cfrom the voice\u201d of David; this means that\nwhile the teacher lectured, a student would take copious notes that\nwere then copied out and circulated, a practice that was not uncommon\nin the Alexandrian school.\n\n Giving introductory lectures to beginners in philosophy was a\nstandard part of higher education at Alexandria; Ammonius and\nOlympiodorus taught such lectures, and as time went on, the ritual\nbecame more and more elaborate: Elias\u2019 \u2018Introduction to\nPhilosophy\u2019 is about twice as long as that of Ammonius, David\u2019s\nabout four times as long. As today, a lecture of this kind offered an\noccasion to inspire students with a love for philosophy. Whereas\nAmmonius\u2019 lectures were pretty dry and to the point, Elias wore the\ncloak of an entertaining intellectual, and David comes across as a\nserious man passionate about philosophy.  Here are the opening lines\nof his first lecture:\n\n Those who passionately love philosophical arguments and have tasted\nthe pleasure that derives from them with their fingertips, having said\nfarewell to all of life\u2019s concerns, are evidently pulled towards these\narguments by some kind of madness and in their souls evoke the love for\nthem by the knowledge of the things that are. As we shall learn with\ngod\u2019s help, philosophy is just this knowledge. Now, since wise love\nand great desire have driven us into this struggle, let us tackle the\ndivine struggle of philosophy without regarding the task before us as\ndifficult; rather in looking towards the end of the divine promise of\nphilosophy, we shall regard any effort as inferior and secondary to\nit.\n \n\n Somewhat surprising is that these words are generally supposed to\nhave been uttered by a Christian. Although it is most certainly wrong\nto reckon with a clear-cut dichotomy between the intellectual commitments\nand sentiments of \u2018Christians\u2019 and \u2018pagans\u2019 in\nlate antiquity, it is striking that David\u2019s text gives us no\nindication that the author was indeed a Christian. On the contrary,\nthere are many features that belong to the old world of pagan\npolytheism: the world is eternal, the soul immortal, the celestial\nbodies divine, and we hear of irrational avenging spirits and\nlong-living nymphs. Moreover, \u2018David\u2019 seems to proselytize\namong his students, trying to turn their minds and souls towards pagan\nGreek philosophy understood as a commitment to a certain way of\nlife. For example, he makes heavy weather of the Platonic idea that\nphilosophy is an assimilation to god and claims at one point that \u201cthe\ncomplete philosopher is similar to god because he is characterized by\nthe same things as god, in particular universal knowledge\u201d (p. 17,\n1ff).  He finishes his lectures with a resounding exhortation that\nphilosophy \u201cadorns human souls and transfers the soul from the dim\ncorporeality of this life to what is divine and immaterial\u201d, citing a\nline from Homer in support (p. 79, 2\u20135).\n\n In the sequence of courses, the \u2018Prolegomena\u2019 were\nfollowed by lectures on Porphyry\u2019s seminal \u2018Introduction to\nAristotle\u2019s Categories\u2019. Porphyry, who started the\nneoplatonic tradition of commentaries on Aristotle at the end of the\n3rd century, was once approached by a Roman senator, Chrysarius, who\nhad great difficulty understanding Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018Categories\u2019; Elias and David tell their students\nhow Porphyry seized the opportunity to write what should turn out to\nbe an extremely popular and influential text, the so-called\n\u2018Isagog\u00ea\u2019 (\u2018Introduction\u2019). The text\ndeals with a detailed explanation of the five logical-ontological key\nconcepts: genus, species, differentia, essential attribute and\naccidental attribute.\n\n David explains that an understanding of this text is in fact not only\nrequisite for an understanding of Aristotle\u2019s Categories, but\nserves also as a preparation for philosophy in general \u2014 in addition\nto providing a training in dialectical method (87, 2\u20135). His view is\nthat the terms Porphyry explicates are the building blocks of any kind\nof philosophical discourse.\n\n In the two texts we still possess, the author also refers to his own\nexegesis of the Categories, the De interpretatione,\nand the Physics, but these commentaries have not been\ndiscovered. Whether or not David lectured also on Plato we do not\nknow.\n3. The Problem of Authorship\n\n\nWe do not know whether the texts transmitted under the name of\n\u2018David\u2019 were written at a time when Olympiodorus was still\nalive and active, or whether they date to the last decades of the 6th,\nbeginning of the 7th, centuries. The inability precisely to date these\ntexts compounds the difficulties that surround the attribution to a\nphilosopher named \u2018David\u2019. These difficulties are\nthreefold:\n\n First, in the Greek tradition, we nowhere find evidence of an\nAlexandrian philosopher named David; neither the Suda nor Hesychius\nnor Photius nor anyone else seems to know of any such person. Second,\nthe texts we have were evidently widely distributed and read, and an\nabbreviated and simplified version of the \u2018Prolegomena to\nPhilosophy\u2019 was translated at some point into Armenian (our\nearliest manuscripts date from the 14th century). The Armenian version\nwas given a new title and attributed to \u2018David, the\nInvincible\u2019, who, according to the Armenian tradition, however,\nwas a theologian of the 5th century. It is impossible to believe that\nthe Armenian theologian and the (Alexandrian) philosopher a century\nlater were one and the same.  There is also no reason to believe that\nthe latter David was of Armenian origin. Here, the cross-fertilization\nof intellectual traditions has given rise to a great deal of confusion\nwhich, in the absence of earlier manuscripts, is quite impossible to\nclear up completely.\n\n The third difficulty concerns the Greek manuscript tradition. All\nof our older manuscripts (from the 11th century onwards) are either\nanonymous or attribute their contents to (1) Elias, or to (2) the saint David\nof Thessaloniki (who died around 530), or (3) to the 10th century\nByzantine scholar Nicetas of Paphlagonia who called himself by the\nmonastic name \u2018David\u2019. Only the 16th century manuscripts\nand one from the 14th century name \u2018David\u2019 at all as\nauthor, and it seems imprudent to put too much, if any, weight on this\nattribution. It is quite possible that the texts we have now under the\nname of David first circulated as anonymous lecture notes and were\nonly later attributed to an author with a good Christian name so as to\nenhance its importance and authority among Christian readers.",
