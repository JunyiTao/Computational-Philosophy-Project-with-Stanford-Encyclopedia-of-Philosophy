    "main_text": "Everyday Psychological Explanation\n6. Everyday Psychological Explanation\n\nGrice\u2019s views on everyday psychological explanation are\nintertwined with his views on rationality. Grice contends that the\nright picture of rationality is the picture, given us by Plato and\nAristotle and others, as something which essentially functions to\nregulate, direct, and control pre-rational impulses, inclinations, and\ndispositions. Both everyday psychological explanation and assessments\nof rationality employ commonsense psychological principles. By such\nprinciples we mean a relatively stable body of generally-accepted\nprinciples, of which the following are examples:\n\nIf a person desires \\(p\\), and believes if \\(p\\) then \\(q\\),\nthen\u2014other things being equal\u2014the person will desire\n\\(q\\).\nIf a person desires \\(p\\) and desires \\(q\\), then\u2014other\nthings being equal\u2014the person will act on the stronger of the\ntwo desires if the person acts on either.\nIf a person stares at a colored surface and subsequently stares at\na white surface, then\u2014other things being equal\u2014the person\nwill have an after-image.\n\n\nThese examples express relations among complexes consisting of\npsychological states and behavior, and, as such they serve a\ndescriptive and explanatory function. Other principles play a more\nevaluative role. Consider for example:\n\nIf a person believes \\(p\\) and that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), and the\nperson believes not-\\(q\\), then, other things being equal, the person\nshould stop believing \\(p\\) or stop believing \\(q\\).\n\n\nConformity to this principle is a criterion of rationality. The\ndescriptive-explanatory and evaluative principles collectively give us\nis a specification of how \u201cpre-rational, impulses, inclinations,\nand dispositions\u201d operate as well as a basis for evaluating that\noperation.\n\nThe essential point for our purposes is that everyday psychology has\nspecial status for Grice. He argues:\n\nThe psychological theory which I envisage would be deficient as a\ntheory to explain behaviour if it did not contain provision for\ninterests in the ascription of psychological states otherwise than as\ntools for explaining and predicting behaviour, interests (for example)\non the part of one creature to be able to ascribe these rather than\nthose psychological states to another creature because of a concern\nfor the other creature. Within such a theory it should be possible to\nderive strong motivations on the part of the creatures subject to the\ntheory against the abandonment of the central concepts of the theory\n(and so of the theory itself), motivations which the creatures would\n(or should) regard as justified. Indeed, only from within the\nframework of such a theory, I think, can matters of evaluation, and\nso, of the evaluation of modes of explanation, be raised at all. If I\nconjecture aright, then, the entrenched system contains the materials\nneeded to justify its own entrenchment; whereas no rival system\ncontains a basis for the justification of anything at all (1975b, 52).\n\n\nThus, while everyday psychology (or some preferred part of it) may not\nentirely accurately specify how in fact we think and act, it does\nspecify how we ought to think and act.\n\nAssume everyday psychology is uniquely self-justifying in the way\nGrice suggests; then we must reject the suggestion that everyday\npsychology is just a rough and ready theory that we will (or could)\neventually abandon without loss in favor of a more accurate and\ncomplete scientific theory of behavior. Grice objects on this ground\nto theories that regard only scientific knowledge as truly descriptive\nand explanatory and that relegate commonsense psychological\nexplanation to a second-class role as a theory, useful in daily life,\nbut not a theory we should endorse as a description or explanation of\nreality. Grice remarks:\n\nWe must be ever watchful against the Devil of scientism, who would\nlead us into myopic overconcentration on the nature and importance of\nknowledge, and of scientific knowledge in particular; the Devil who is\neven so audacious as to tempt us to call in question the very system\nof ideas require to make intelligible the idea of calling in question\nanything at all; and who would even prompt us, in effect, to suggest\nthat since we do not really think but only think that we think, we had\nbetter change our minds without undue delay (1975b, 53).\n\n\nThus, to return briefly to the theory of meaning, the picture that\ntheory offers of ourselves as rational communicators producing\njustified psychological attitudes in each other is no mere accident,\nno explanatory way station to be abandoned as science progresses. It\nis an ineliminable feature of the way in which we understand ourselves\nand others. In addition to this result, Grice\u2019s view of\npsychological explanation also yield consequences both for ontology\nand for ethics.\n",
