    "main_text": "\n\n\nMany of the significant contributors to the fast-developing field of\nsocial epistemology have been feminist epistemologists, theorists who\ninvestigate the role of gender in knowledge production. Motivated by\nthe political project of eliminating the oppression of women, feminist\nepistemologists are interested in how the norms and practices of\nknowledge production affect the lives of women and are implicated in\nsystems of oppression. Feminist epistemologists seek to understand not\nonly how our social relations of gender have shaped our\nknowledge practices, but also whether and how these relations\nshould play a role in good knowing. Feminists have\ndistinguished between the categories of gender and (anatomical) sex,\nand for decades have focused much of their attention on gender, the analytical\ncategory capturing the cultural and social aspects of sexed\n bodies.[1]\nAs a category of social relations then, gender is a significant area\nof investigation for social epistemology. Additionally, feminist\nepistemologists have increasingly attended to the interrelations\nbetween gender and other social categories such as race and ethnicity,\nclass, sexuality, ability status, and global location, investigating\ntheir significance for knowledge.\n\n\nElizabeth Anderson characterizes feminist epistemology as properly\nbelonging within social epistemology, describing it as \u201cthe branch of\nsocial epistemology that investigates the influence of socially\nconstructed conceptions and norms of gender and gender-specific\ninterests and experiences on the production of knowledge\u201d(1995a,\n54). It may be too strong a claim to suggest that all projects of\nfeminist epistemology fall within the realm of social epistemology; it\ncould be argued that some projects of feminist epistemology, such as\nLouise Antony\u2019s defense of epistemological individualism (1995),\nresist at least certain elements of a social epistemology. Similarly,\ntheorists who argue that there are epistemically valuable feminine\nways of knowing integral to women, without providing a social\nanalysis, could also be viewed as resisting certain elements of a\nsocial epistemology.[2]\n Nevertheless, by far the majority of work in feminist epistemology is\nbest understood as a form of social epistemology.\n\n\nFeminist social epistemology represents more than just a small subset\nof social epistemology, however. The significant body of work of\nfeminist social epistemologists has provided key theoretical resources\nfor understanding the breadth and depth of the social dimensions of\nknowing. The interest of feminist social epistemologists in how gender\nplays out in knowledge practices is generalizable to an interest in\nhow power relations play out epistemically, especially systematic\nrelations of power. Their focus on power relations has led some to\ncharacterize feminist social epistemologists as falling on the radical\nend of the social epistemology spectrum (Goldman 2001; Kitcher\n1994). Radical or not, few feminist epistemologists reduce knowledge\nto power politics, even as they draw attention to them. One of the key\nfeatures of feminist epistemologies responsible for some of their\nsignificant contributions within social epistemology has been their\nserious commitment to developing normative epistemological\naccounts. \n\n\nSocial epistemology distinguishes itself from sociology of knowledge\nin its goal of providing a normative analysis of knowledge (Fuller\n1988; Schmitt 1994a), seeking not only to describe our current social\npractices of knowledge production, but also to understand how we ought\nto know and how we can improve our knowledge practices. There is\nlittle agreement among social epistemologists on the scope or form of\nsuch normativity. However, feminist social epistemologists have felt\nthis need to incorporate a normative dimension to their social\nanalyses in a particularly pressing way: feminist political demands\nfor the elimination of oppression are normative in a moral sense, but\nthey also depend on epistemically normative claims for their\njustification. Their force depends on the ability to distinguish\nbetween better and worse claims to knowledge, for example by\ncriticizing sexist knowledge claims and supporting non-sexist\nknowledge claims. Feminists can ill afford to simply describe the ways\nin which social relations such as gender currently shape knowledge\npractices if they are to defend their claims for social change. Thus,\nfeminist social epistemologists have a particularly strong motivation\nto develop rich accounts that tease epistemic normativity out of a\npower-sensitive social understanding of knowledge production.\n\n\nAs is true of social epistemology as a whole, there is a great deal of\nvariation in the theories and approaches constituting feminist\nepistemology and few generalizations can be made across the field.\nAcknowledging such variety, some theorists refer only to \u201cfeminist\nepistemologies\u201d in the plural, fearing that characterizing a single\nfield of feminist epistemology implies a greater unity than exists.\nOthers have argued that feminist epistemology should best be\nidentified not by its specific theoretical content, but rather by what\n\u201cdoing epistemology as a feminist\u201d amounts to (Longino 1999). Doing\nepistemology as a feminist involves bringing one\u2019s feminist concerns\nand sensibilities to the epistemological table. As a result of\nbringing such concerns to epistemological work, significant feminist\ncontributions to social epistemology have included extensive critiques\nof the individualism of contemporary analytic epistemology, the\ndevelopment of alternative models of knowers as social beings,\ndefenses of the appropriate role of values and other culturally\nrelative factors in knowing, the development of socially informed\nconceptions of objectivity, analyses of the challenges of knowing\nunder social conditions of oppression, and analyses of the epistemic\nbenefits of social justice and democratic institutions.\n\n",
