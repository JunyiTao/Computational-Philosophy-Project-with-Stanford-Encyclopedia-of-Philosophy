    "main_text": "Why be a Moral Naturalist?\n3. Why be a Moral Naturalist?\n\nMoral naturalism is a very popular view (although it might be more\naccurate to say that \u201cmoral naturalism\u201d is a popular\nlabel\u2026). That\u2019s because moral naturalism is the\nconjunction of two views that are themselves very popular. The first\nis naturalism: that everything which exists is natural. The second is\nmoral realism: that stance-independent moral facts exist. Combine\nthese two, and we get the conclusion that moral facts (exist and) are\nstance-independent natural facts. Thus:\n\nThe Basic Argument for Moral Naturalism\n\n1.\nNaturalism\n2.\nMoral Realism\n3.\nTherefore, Moral Naturalism\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll look at more technical arguments for moral naturalism\nshortly, but the Basic Argument is the reason why so many\nmetaethicists have a default sympathy for moral naturalism. It\u2019s\na popular conjunction of two popular views. Naturalism has proven to\nbe the most successful project, ever, for advancing human knowledge\nand understanding. The success of naturalism doesn\u2019t entail that\nthat nothing exists which can\u2019t be accounted for\nnaturalistically, nor does it entail that there are no other projects\nthat could successfully advance human knowledge and understanding. But\nmany philosophers suspect that empirical methods have been so\ndramatically successful in shedding light on so many different areas\nof inquiry because some version of naturalism is correct.\n(Non-naturalists disagree, of course!)\n\nSimilarly, moral realism is a popular view. There are many different\nmoral claims \u2013 that rape and murder are wrong, for instance, or\nthat helping others in need is good \u2013 that have the status of\ncommon sense. We treat these common sense moral claims, at least\nimplicitly, as accurately describing reality and not being mere\nmatters of opinion. Moral realism is popular precisely because it\npromises to do justice to this common attitude towards our moral\ncommitments. (Anti-realists disagree, of course!)\n",
