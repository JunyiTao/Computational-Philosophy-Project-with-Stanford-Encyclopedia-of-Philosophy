    "main_text": "\n\nAmmonius (ca. 435/445\u2013517/526) taught philosophy at Alexandria,\nwhere his father Hermeias had taught earlier. Known primarily for his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, which were said to be of greater benefit\nthan anyone else\u2019s, he was also distinguished in geometry and\nastronomy. Himself a pupil of Proclus at Athens, at Alexandria\nAmmonius taught most of the important Platonists of the late\n5th and early 6th centuries: Asclepius,\nDamascius and Simplicius, Eutocius, and Olympiodorus; Elias and David\nare considered indirect pupils of his. Damascius, who went on to head\nthe school at Athens, heard Ammonius lecture, but attached himself\nrather to the mentorship of Isidore and followed him to Athens. While\nalmost all of Ammonius\u2019 Aristotle commentaries were published by\nstudents from his lectures, the large commentary on De\nInterpretatione was written up by Ammonius himself for\npublication. These commentaries are largely dependent on the lectures\nof Proclus and, to a lesser extent, Syrianus and thus indebted to\ntheir style of Iamblichean Neoplatonism. Ammonius is known for several\ncontributions, especially for the introduction of an Alexandrian\ntradition of commentary on Aristotle, but also for the first preserved\nversion of the set of questions to be answered preliminary to the\nstudy of Aristotle, the thesis that for Aristotle God is the efficient\nas well as final cause of the world, and the treatment of the sea\nbattle of De Interpretatione 9 as one of three determinist\narguments, along with the \u2018Reaper\u2019 and the argument from\ndivine foreknowledge.\n",
