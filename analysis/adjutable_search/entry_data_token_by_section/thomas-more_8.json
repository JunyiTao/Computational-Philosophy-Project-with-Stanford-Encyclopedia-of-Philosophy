Judgments \u201cin conscience\u201d\n\n\u201cRight conscience\u201d, for More, is a judgment of the\npractical intellect about some particular matter, in light of\nprinciples discovered to be true\u2014and if doubt arose about a\nfundamental principle, he held it to be the duty of a properly\nconvened international General Counsel to clarify the principle\ninvolved, judged in light of the entire received tradition (<August\n1534> letter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington [EW\n1316\u201317]). More explained this to his daughter Margaret when she\ncame for the third time to convince her father to leave prison and to\nsign the oath, as she and their friends had all done. More pointed out\nthe danger of \u201cframing oneself a conscience\u201d to gratify\none\u2019s desire rather than to determine what is true. Accused of\nbeing a \u201cfoolish scrupulous ass\u201d, More told one of his\nmost famous \u201cmerry tales\u201d about \u201ca poor honest man\nof the country that was called Company\u201d who refused to perjure\nhimself as a jury member. When pressed to go along with the others,\nCompany says:\n\n\n[N]ow when we shall hence and come before God, and that he shall send\nyou to heaven for doing according to your conscience, and me to the\ndevil for doing against mine, \u2026 if I shall then say to all you\nagain, \u2018Masters, I went once for good company with you, which is\nthe cause that I go now to hell, play you the good fellows now again\nwith me; as I went then for good company with you, so some of you now\nfor good company with me. (EW 1314\u201315)\n\n\n\u201cConscience\u201d became a word More used with great frequency\ntowards the end of his life. But even in his earliest education\nletter, he twice identified a \u201cright conscience [recti\nconscientia]\u201d as one of the main goals of education\n(<1518> letter to Gonell [EW 288.76\u201377, 289.80]),\nand, in his earliest poetry, as we have seen, he wrote that: \u201cOf\nvirtue more joy the conscience hath within / Than outward the body of\nall his filthy sin\u201d (c. 1510 Life of Pico [EW\n87.139\u201341]), and that there is \u201cno pleasure comparable\n\u2026 / To th\u2019inward gladness of a virtuous mind\u201d (c.\n1510 Life of Pico [EW 89.74\u201375]). He expressed\nthis same thought in prison, writing that \u201cthe clearness of my\nconscience hath made my heart hop for joy\u201d, knowing that he had\nsearched for seven years and was \u201cvery sure \u2026 in refusing\nto swear against mine own conscience\u201d (1534 letter to Margaret\nRoper [EW 1324.68\u201369]).\n\nJudgments made \u201cin conscience\u201d were so central to More\nthat he discussed this issue with Henry VIII before agreeing to enter\nthe king\u2019s service in 1518; he had a similar conversation\nregarding his service as Lord Chancellor of England in 1529. Both\ntimes, More reported, Henry gave the \u201cmost virtuous lesson that\never prince taught his servant\u201d:\n\n\nthat I should perceive mine own conscience should serve me, and that I\nshould first look unto God and after God unto him. (5 March\n<1534> letter to Thomas Cromwell [EW 384.70\u201375],\n1534 letter to Wilson [EW 1321.35\u201341], <3 June\n1535> letter to Margaret Roper [EW 1332.67\u201373])\n\n",
