    "main_text": "Underdetermination\n2. Underdetermination\n\nMany philosophers hold that evidence is not sufficient to determine\nwhich scientific theory we should choose. Scientific theories make\nclaims about the natural world that extend far beyond what can be\ndirectly established through observations or experiments. Rival\ntheories may fare equally well with regard to some body of data, yet\ngive quite different accounts of the world. Philosophers often treat\nthe existence of such rivals as inevitable: for a given theory, it is\nalways possible to construct rival theories that have \u201cequally\ngood fit\u201d with available data. Duhem (1914 [1954]) gave an\ninfluential characterization of the difficulty in establishing\nphysical theories conclusively, followed a half century later by\nQuine\u2019s arguments for a strikingly general version of\nunderdetermination (e.g., Quine 1970). The nature of this proposed\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence, and appropriate responses to\nit, have been central topics in philosophy of science (Stanford 2009\n[2016]). Although philosophers have identified a variety of distinct\nsenses of underdetermination, they have generally agreed that\nunderdetermination poses a challenge to justifying scientific\ntheories.\n\nThere is a striking contrast with discussions of underdetermination\namong scientists, who often emphasize instead the enormous difficulty\nin constructing compelling rival\n theories.[16]\n This contrast reflects a disagreement regarding how to characterize\nthe empirical content of theories. Suppose that the empirical content\nof theory consists of a set of observational claims implied by the\ntheory. Philosophers then take the existence of rival theories to be\nstraightforward. Van Fraassen (1980), for example, defines a theory as\n\u201cempirically adequate\u201d if what it says about observable\nphenomena is true, and argues that for any successful theory there are\nrival theories that disagree about theoretical claims. If we demand\nmore of theories than empirical adequacy in this sense, it is possible\nto draw distinctions among theories that philosophers would regard as\nunderdetermined. Furthermore, even when scientists do face a choice\namong competing theories, they are almost never rivals in the\nphilosopher\u2019s sense. Instead, they differ in various ways:\nintended domain of applicability, explanatory scope, importance\nattributed to particular problems, and so on.\n\nThe scientists\u2019 relatively dismissive attitude towards alleged\nunderdetermination threats may be based on a more demanding conception\nof empirical\n success.[17]\n Scientists demand much more of their theories than mere compatibility\nwith some set of observational claims: they must fit into a larger\nexplanatory scheme, and be compatible with other successful theories.\nGiven a more stringent account of empirical success it is much more\nchallenging to find rival theories. (We return to this issue in\n \u00a75\n below.)\n\nOne aspect of underdetermination (emphasized by Stanford 2006) is of\nmore direct relevance to scientific debates: current theories may be\nindistinguishable, within a restricted domain, from a successor\ntheory, even though the successor theory makes different predictions\nfor other domains. This raises the question of how far we can rely on\nextrapolating a theory to a new domain. For example, despite its\nsuccess in describing objects moving with low relative velocities in a\nweak gravitational field, where it is nearly indistinguishable from\ngeneral relativity, Newtonian gravity does not apply to other regimes.\nHow far, then, can we rely on a theory to extend our reach? The\nobstacles to making such reliable inferences reflect the specific\ndetails of particular domains of inquiry. Below we will focus on the\nobstacles to answering theoretical questions in cosmology due to the\nstructure of the universe and our limited access to phenomena.\n",
