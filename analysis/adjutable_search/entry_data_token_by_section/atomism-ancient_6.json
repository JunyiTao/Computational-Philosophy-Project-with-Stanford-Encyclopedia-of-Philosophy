    "main_text": "Ancient Greek Atomism || Plato, Platonists and Pythagoreans\n2.2 Plato, Platonists and Pythagoreans\n\nAlthough the Greek term atomos is most commony associated\nwith the solid and impenetrable bodies posited by Leucippus and\nDemocritus, Plato\u2019s Timaeus presents a different kind\nof physical theory based on indivisibles and was also regarded as a\nkind of atomism. Plato\u2019s discussion of the composition of solids\nfrom plane surfaces is sometimes thought to be based on fourth-century\nPythagorean theories. A fourth-century Pythagorean, Ecphantus,\ninterpreted the Pythagorean monads as indivisible bodies: he is\nreported to have been sympathetic to atomism of a kind similar to\nDemocritus\u2019.\n\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus elaborates an account of the world\nwherein the four different basic kinds of body\u2014earth, air, fire,\nand water\u2014are regular solids composed from plane figures:\nisosceles and scalene right-angled triangles. Because the same\ntriangles can form into different regular solids, the theory thus\nexplains how some of the elements can transform into one another, as\nwas widely believed. In this theory, it is the elemental triangles\ncomposing the solids that are regarded as indivisible, not the solids\nthemselves. When Aristotle discusses the hypothesis that the natural\nworld is composed of indivisibles, the two views he considers are\nthose of Plato and Democritus. Aristotle criticizes both Plato and\nfourth-century Pythagoreans for constructing natural bodies possessing\nweight from indivisible mathematical abstractions, whether plane\nsurfaces or numbers. It has been suggested that Plato accepted time\natoms, i.e., indivisible minima in time, but this is\ncontroversial.\n\nA treatise in the Aristotelian corpus probably not by Aristotle\nhimself (On Indivisible Lines) addresses and refutes a number\nof arguments offered for the existence of indivisible lines, without\nnaming their author. Plato\u2019s student Xenocrates (396\u2013314\nBCE), third head of the Academy, is reported to believe in indivisible\nlines, and he may well be the target of the Aristotelian treatise. One\nof the arguments attacked addresses a Zenonian problem about\ntraversing or touching in succession an infinite series of parts. The\nidea that there are indivisible lines offers an alternative to the\nview that any extended magnitude must be divisible to infinity. A\ndistinct argument claims that, if the physical elements composing a\nbody are regarded as the ultimate parts, they cannot be further\ndivisible. Although this does not argue for indivisible lines per\nse, it is used to suggest that the objects of sense as well as\nthose of thought must include things without parts.\n\nA further argument depends on thinking that opposite properties must\nhave opposite characteristics: if \u2018many\u2019 or\n\u2018large\u2019 things have infinite parts, it is argued, then\n\u2018few\u2019 or \u2018small\u2019 things must have only a\nfinite number of parts. It is then concluded that there must be a\nmagnitude without parts, apparently so that it is not further\ndivisible and thus composed of an infinite number of parts. The last\nargument depends on the idea that mathematicians talk of commensurable\nlines, and posit a single unit of measurement: this would not be\npossible if the unit were divisible, because the parts of the unit, if\nmeasured, would be measured by the unit measure and it would then turn\nout to contain multiple units within itself.\n\nIn late antiquity, the Neoplatonist Proclus defended Plato\u2019s\naccount against Aristotle\u2019s objections; these arguments are\npreserved in Simplicius\u2019 commentary on Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Heavens. Simplicius credits the Pythagoreans as well as Plato\nwith a theory composing bodies from plane surfaces. Simplicius also\ncompares Pythagorean views to Democritean atomism, inasmuch as both\ntheories posit a cause for hot and cold rather than taking these to be\nfundamental principles, as the Aristotelians do.\n",
