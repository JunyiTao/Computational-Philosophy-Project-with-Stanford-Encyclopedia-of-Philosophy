This has to be due\nto special initial conditions at the start of the universe (Ellis\n2007). This is related to the Sommerfeld outgoing radiation condition\nand Penrose\u2019s Weyl curvature hypothesis (Penrose 2016).\n\n\nIn each case, global boundary conditions have an important effect on\nlocal physics. More recent ones relate to\n\nNucleosynthesis, where the course of nuclear reactions is\ndetermined by the \\(T(t)\\) relation that is controlled by cosmological\nevolution (Steigman 2007) (the temperature \\(T\\) being a coarse\ngrained variable with evolution determined by the average density\n\\(\\rho\\) of matter in the universe through the Friedmann\nequation)\nStructure formation due to gravitational instability\n(Mukhanov et al. 1992), which is affected crucially by the expansion\nof the universe, which turns what would have been an exponential\ngrowth of inhomogeneity(in a static universe) to a power law growth.\nIt is because of this effect that studies of structure such as the BAO\nand CMB anisotropies give us strong limits on the parameters of the\nbackground model (Ade et al. 2016).\nThe Anthropic Principle, discussed below\n (\u00a74.1),\n whereby large-scale conditions in the universe (such as the value of\nthe cosmological constant and the initial amplitude of inhomogeneities\nin the early universe) provide local conditions suitable for life to\ncome into being.\n\n\nRelevant to all this is the idea of an \u201ceffective\nhorizon\u201d: the domain that has direct impact on structures\nexisting on the Earth, roughly 1 Mpc co-moving sphere, see Ellis &\nStoeger 2009. This is the part of the universe that actually has a\nsignificant effect on our history.\n",
