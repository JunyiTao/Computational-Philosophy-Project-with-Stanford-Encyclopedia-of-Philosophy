    "main_text": "Quantum Probabilities || Probabilities in quantum mechanics\n3.2 Probabilities in quantum mechanics\nThe histories interpretation of quantum mechanics employs\nprobability theory in exactly the same way as in the other\nsciences once a sample space \\(\\SC\\) has been specified. A\nquantum sample space \\(\\SC\\) is always a projective decomposition of\nthe identity operator \\(I\\), hereafter referred to as a\n\u201cprojective decomposition\u201d (or\n\u201cdecomposition\u201d), on the quantum Hilbert space \\(\\HC\\) used\nto model the situation of interest. That is to say, a collection\n\\(\\{P_j\\}\\) of projectors (\\(P^{}_j = P_j^\\dagger =P_j^2)\\) which are\nmutually orthogonal (\\(P_jP_k = 0\\) for \\(j\\neq k\\)) and sum to the\nidentity\n\\[I = \\sum_j P_j.  \\label{eqn5}\\]\nThese projectors represent mutually exclusive properties\n(implied by orthogonality), one of which is true (implied by the sum\nequal to \\(I\\)) in any given experiment or situation to which the model\nis being applied.\nThe event algebra \\(\\EC\\) consists of all projectors formed by taking\nsums of some of the \\(P_j\\) in the collection; i.e., \\(\\sum_j\\pi_j P_j\\),\nwhere each \\(\\pi_j\\) is either 0 or 1. This includes the identity\noperator \\(I\\) and the zero operator 0 along with such things as \\(P_2\\)\nor \\(P_1+P_3\\). The event algebra is a Boolean algebra in the sense that\nthe complement \\(I-P\\) of any projector and the product \\(PQ\\) of any two\nprojectors belonging to \\(\\EC\\) is an element of \\(\\EC\\). The\nterm framework can refer to either the sample space or the\nevent algebra constructed from it in this way, since there is a\none-to-one correspondence between the two. Quantum theory does not in\ngeneral specify the probability \\(p_j\\) to be assigned to the projector\n\\(P_j\\) in \\(\\SC\\), apart from the requirement that it be nonnegative, and\nthat the \\(p_j\\) sum to 1 (but see subsection 4.2\nconcerning time dependence). Thus, for example, to the element\n\\(P_1+P_3\\) of \\(\\EC\\) one assigns the probability\n\\(p_1+p_3\\). The intuitive interpretation of probabilities\nintroduced in this way is the same as in the other sciences which\nemploy probability theory as long as a single framework is in\nview. What is distinctly different in the quantum case is the\nexistence of multiple incompatible frameworks; given these consistency\nrequires that one adopt the single framework\nrule, subsection 3.4.\n",
