    "main_text": "The Computational Theory of Mind\n8. The Computational Theory of Mind\n\nThe leading contemporary version of the Representational Theory of\nMind, the Computational Theory of Mind (CTM), claims that the brain is\na kind of computer and that mental processes are computations.\nAccording to CTM, cognitive states are constituted by computational\nrelations to mental representations of various kinds, and cognitive\nprocesses are sequences of such states.\n\nCTM develops RTM by attempting to explain all psychological\nstates and processes in terms of mental representation. In the course\nof constructing detailed empirical theories of human and other animal\ncognition, and developing models of cognitive processes implementable\nin artificial information processing systems, cognitive scientists\nhave proposed a variety of types of mental representations. While some\nof these may be suited to be mental relata of commonsense\npsychological states, some \u2013 so-called \u201csubpersonal\u201d\nor \u201csub-doxastic\u201d representations \u2013 are not. Though\nmany philosophers believe that CTM can provide the best scientific\nexplanations of cognition and behavior, there is disagreement over\nwhether such explanations will vindicate the commonsense psychological\nexplanations of prescientific RTM.\n\nAccording to Stich\u2019s (1983) Syntactic Theory of Mind, for\nexample, computational theories of psychological states should concern\nthemselves only with the formal properties of the objects\nthose states are relations to. Commitment to the explanatory relevance\nof content, however, is for most cognitive scientists\nfundamental (Fodor 1981a, Pylyshyn 1984, Von Eckardt 1993). That\nmental processes are computations, that computations are rule-governed\nsequences of semantically evaluable objects, and that the\nrules apply to the symbols in virtue of their content, are central\ntenets of mainstream cognitive science.\n\nExplanations in cognitive science appeal to a many different kinds of\nmental representation, including, for example, the \u201cmental\nmodels\u201d of Johnson-Laird 1983, the \u201cretinal arrays,\u201d\n\u201cprimal sketches\u201d and \u201c2\u00bd-D sketches\u201d\nof Marr 1982, the \u201cframes\u201d of Minsky 1974, the\n\u201csub-symbolic\u201d structures of Smolensky 1989, the\n\u201cquasi-pictures\u201d of Kosslyn 1980, and the\n\u201cinterpreted symbol-filled arrays\u201d of Tye 1991 \u2013 in\naddition to representations that may be appropriate to the explanation\nof commonsense psychological states. Computational explanations have\nbeen offered of, among other mental phenomena, belief (Fodor 1975,\n2008 Field 1978), visual perception (Marr 1982, Osherson, et al.\n1990), rationality (Newell and Simon 1972, Fodor 1975, Johnson-Laird\nand Wason 1977), language learning and use (Chomsky 1965, Pinker\n1989), and musical comprehension (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983).\n\nA fundamental disagreement among proponents of CTM concerns the\nrealization of personal-level representations (e.g., thoughts) and\nprocesses (e.g., inferences) in the brain. The central debate here is\nbetween proponents of Classical Architectures and proponents\nof Connectionist Architectures.\n\nThe classicists (e.g., Turing 1950, Fodor 1975, 2000, 2003, 2008,\nFodor and Pylyshyn 1988, Marr 1982, Newell and Simon 1976) hold that\nmental representations are symbolic structures, which\ntypically have semantically evaluable constituents, and that mental\nprocesses are rule-governed manipulations of them that are sensitive\nto their constituent structure. The connectionists (e.g., McCulloch\n& Pitts 1943, Rumelhart 1989, Rumelhart and McClelland 1986,\nSmolensky 1988) hold that mental representations are realized by\npatterns of activation in a network of simple processors\n(\u201cnodes\u201d) and that mental processes consist of the\nspreading activation of such patterns. The nodes themselves are,\ntypically, not taken to be semantically evaluable; nor do the patterns\nhave semantically evaluable constituents. (Though there are versions\nof Connectionism \u2013 \u201clocalist\u201d versions \u2013 on\nwhich individual nodes are taken to have semantic properties (e.g.,\nBallard 1986.) It is arguable, however,\nthat localist theories are neither definitive nor representative of\nthe connectionist program (Smolensky 1988, 1991, Chalmers 1993).)\n\nClassicists are motivated (in part) by properties thought seems to\nshare with language. Fodor\u2019s Language of Thought Hypothesis\n(LOTH) (Fodor 1975, 1987, 2008), according to which the system of\nmental symbols constituting the neural basis of thought is structured\nlike a language, provides a well-worked-out version of the classical\napproach as applied to commonsense psychology. (Cf. also Marr 1982 for\nan application of classical approach in scientific psychology.)\nAccording to the LOTH, the potential infinity of complex\nrepresentational mental states is generated from a finite stock of\nprimitive representational states, in accordance with recursive\nformation rules. This combinatorial structure accounts for the\nproperties of productivity and systematicity of the\nsystem of mental representations. As in the case of symbolic\nlanguages, including natural languages (though Fodor does not suppose\neither that the LOTH explains only linguistic capacities or that only\nverbal creatures have this sort of cognitive architecture), these\nproperties of thought are explained by appeal to the content of the\nrepresentational units and their combinability into contentful\ncomplexes. That is, the semantics of both language and thought is\ncompositional: the content of a complex representation is\ndetermined by the contents of its constituents and their structural\nconfiguration. (See, e.g.,Fodor and Lepore 2002.) \n\nConnectionists are motivated mainly by a consideration of the\narchitecture of the brain, which apparently consists of layered\nnetworks of interconnected neurons. They argue that this sort of\narchitecture is unsuited to carrying out classical serial\ncomputations. For one thing, processing in the brain is typically\nmassively parallel. In addition, the elements whose manipulation\ndrives computation in connectionist networks (principally, the\nconnections between nodes) are neither semantically compositional nor\nsemantically evaluable, as they are on the classical approach. This\ncontrast with classical computationalism is often characterized by\nsaying that representation is, with respect to computation,\ndistributed as opposed to local: representation is\nlocal if it is computationally basic; and distributed if it is not.\n(Another way of putting this is to say that for classicists mental\nrepresentations are computationally atomic, whereas for\nconnectionists they are not.)\n\nMoreover, connectionists argue that information processing as it\noccurs in connectionist networks more closely resembles some features\nof actual human cognitive functioning. For example, whereas on the\nclassical view learning involves something like hypothesis formation\nand testing (Fodor 1981c), on the connectionist model it is a matter\nof evolving distribution of \u201cweights\u201d (strengths) on the\nconnections between nodes, and typically does not involve the\nformulation of hypotheses regarding the identity conditions for the\nobjects of knowledge. The connectionist network is \u201ctrained\nup\u201d by repeated exposure to the objects it is to learn to\ndistinguish; and, though networks typically require many more\nexposures to the objects than do humans, this seems to model at least\none feature of this type of human learning quite well. (Cf. the sonar\nexample in Churchland 1989.)\n\nFurther, degradation in the performance of such networks in response\nto damage is gradual, not sudden as in the case of a classical\ninformation processor, and hence more accurately models the loss of\nhuman cognitive function as it typically occurs in response to brain\ndamage. It is also sometimes claimed that connectionist systems show\nthe kind of flexibility in response to novel situations typical of\nhuman cognition \u2013 situations in which classical systems are\nrelatively \u201cbrittle\u201d or \u201cfragile.\u201d\n\nSome philosophers have maintained that connectionism entails that\nthere are no propositional attitudes. Ramsey, Stich and Garon (1990)\nhave argued that if connectionist models of cognition are basically\ncorrect, then there are no discrete representational states as\nconceived in ordinary commonsense psychology and classical cognitive\nscience. Others, however (e.g., Smolensky 1989), hold that certain\ntypes of higher-level patterns of activity in a neural network may be\nroughly identified with the representational states of commonsense\npsychology. Still others (e.g., Fodor & Pylyshyn 1988, Heil 1991,\nHorgan and Tienson 1996) argue that language-of-thought style\nrepresentation is both necessary in general and realizable within\nconnectionist architectures. (MacDonald & MacDonald 1995 collects\nthe central contemporary papers in the classicist/connectionist\ndebate, and provides useful introductory material as well. See also\nVon Eckardt 2005.)\n\nWhereas Stich (1983) accepts that mental processes are computational,\nbut denies that computations are sequences of mental representations,\nothers accept the notion of mental representation, but deny that CTM\nprovides the correct account of mental states and processes.\n\nVan Gelder (1995) denies that psychological processes are\ncomputational. He argues that cognitive systems are dynamic,\nand that cognitive states are not relations to mental symbols, but\nquantifiable states of a complex system consisting of (in the case of\nhuman beings) a nervous system, a body and the environment in which\nthey are embedded. Cognitive processes are not rule-governed sequences\nof discrete symbolic states, but continuous, evolving total states of\ndynamic systems determined by continuous, simultaneous and mutually\ndetermining states of the systems\u2019 components. Representation in\na dynamic system is essentially information-theoretic, though the\nbearers of information are not symbols, but state variables or\nparameters. (See also Port and Van Gelder 1995; Clark 1997a, 1997b,\n2008.)\n\nHorst (1996), on the other hand, argues that though computational\nmodels may be useful in scientific psychology, they are of no help in\nachieving a philosophical understanding of the intentionality of\ncommonsense mental states. CTM attempts to reduce the\nintentionality of such states to the intentionality of the mental\nsymbols they are relations to. But, Horst claims, the relevant notion\nof symbolic content is essentially bound up with the notions of\nconvention and intention. So CTM involves itself in a vicious\ncircularity: the very properties that are supposed to be reduced are\n(tacitly) appealed to in the reduction.\n\nSee the entries on the\n computational theory of mind\n and\n connectionism.\n \n",
