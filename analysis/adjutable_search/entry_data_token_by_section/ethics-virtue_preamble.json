    "main_text": "\n\nVirtue ethics is currently one of three major approaches in normative\nethics. It may, initially, be identified as the one that emphasizes\nthe virtues, or moral character, in contrast to the approach that\nemphasizes duties or rules (deontology) or that emphasizes the\nconsequences of actions (consequentialism). Suppose it is obvious that\nsomeone in need should be helped. A utilitarian will point to the fact\nthat the consequences of doing so will maximize well-being, a\ndeontologist to the fact that, in doing so the agent will be acting in\naccordance with a moral rule such as \u201cDo unto others as you\nwould be done by\u201d and a virtue ethicist to the fact that helping\nthe person would be charitable or benevolent.\n\nThis is not to say that only virtue ethicists attend to virtues, any\nmore than it is to say that only consequentialists attend to\nconsequences or only deontologists to rules. Each of the\nabove-mentioned approaches can make room for virtues, consequences,\nand rules. Indeed, any plausible normative ethical theory\nwill have something to say about all three. What distinguishes virtue\nethics from consequentialism or deontology is the centrality of virtue\nwithin the theory (Watson 1990; Kawall 2009). Whereas\nconsequentialists will define virtues as traits that yield good\nconsequences and deontologists will define them as traits possessed by\nthose who reliably fulfil their duties, virtue ethicists will resist\nthe attempt to define virtues in terms of some other concept that is\ntaken to be more fundamental. Rather, virtues and vices will be\nfoundational for virtue ethical theories and other normative notions\nwill be grounded in them.\n\nWe begin by discussing two concepts that are central to all forms of\nvirtue ethics, namely, virtue and practical wisdom. Then we note some\nof the features that distinguish different virtue ethical theories\nfrom one another before turning to objections that have been raised\nagainst virtue ethics and responses offered on its behalf. We conclude\nwith a look at some of the directions in which future research might\ndevelop.\n",
