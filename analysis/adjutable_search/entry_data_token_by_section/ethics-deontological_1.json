    "main_text": "Deontological Theories\n2. Deontological Theories\n\nHaving now briefly taken a look at deontologists\u2019 foil,\nconsequentialist theories of right action, we turn now to examine\ndeontological theories. In contrast to consequentialist theories,\ndeontological theories judge the morality of choices by criteria\ndifferent from the states of affairs those choices bring about. The\nmost familiar forms of deontology, and also the forms presenting the\ngreatest contrast to consequentialism, hold that some choices cannot\nbe justified by their effects\u2014that no matter how morally good\ntheir consequences, some choices are morally forbidden. On such\nfamiliar deontological accounts of morality, agents cannot make\ncertain wrongful choices even if by doing so the number of those exact\nkinds of wrongful choices will be minimized (because other agents will\nbe prevented from engaging in similar wrongful choices). For such\ndeontologists, what makes a choice right is its conformity with a\nmoral norm. Such norms are to be simply obeyed by each moral agent;\nsuch norm-keepings are not to be maximized by each agent. In this\nsense, for such deontologists, the Right is said to have priority over\nthe Good. If an act is not in accord with the Right, it may not be\nundertaken, no matter the Good that it might produce (including even a\nGood consisting of acts in accordance with the Right).\n\nAnalogously, deontologists typically supplement non-consequentialist\nobligations with non-consequentialist permissions (Scheffler 1982).\nThat is, certain actions can be right even though not maximizing of\ngood consequences, for the rightness of such actions consists in their\ninstantiating certain norms (here, of permission and not of\nobligation). Such actions are permitted, not just in the weak sense\nthat there is no obligation not to do them, but also in the strong\nsense that one is permitted to do them even though they are productive\nof less good consequences than their alternatives (Moore 2008). Such\nstrongly permitted actions include actions one is obligated to do, but\n(importantly) also included are actions one is not obligated to do. It\nis this last feature of such actions that warrants their separate\nmention for deontologists.\n\n",
