    "main_text": "From Monadic to Polyadic Logic || Relations and quantification formalized\n1.1 Relations and quantification formalized\n\nPeirce\u2019s quantification theory is presented in a comprehensive\nway together with axiomlike \u201cicons\u201d in his 1885 paper\n\u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the Philosophy of\nNotations\u201d. Peirce\u2019s not-short journey to modern logic\nstarted with his attempt to extend the territory of formalization. In\nthis, Peirce was inspired by De Morgan\u2019s struggle for the\nrepresentation of relations, and at the same time Peirce was empowered\nwith Boolean calculus which formalizes Aristotelian term logic. That\nis, Peirce took De Morgan\u2019s ambition as a road map for the\ndirection while being equipped with Boole\u2019s method and notation\nfor getting there. This subsection will follow Peirce\u2019s journey\nto see how he reached the destination, by checking in at his main\nstops.\n\nThe title of Peirce\u2019s 1870 paper \u201cDescription of a\nNotation for the Logic of Relatives, Resulting from an Amplification\nof the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s Calculus\u201d (DNLR) is spelled\nout at the beginning of the paper in the following way:\n\n\n[I]t is interesting to inquire whether it [Boole\u2019s logical\nalgebra] cannot be extended over to the whole realm of formal logic,\ninstead of being restricted to that simplest and least useful part of\nthe subject, the logic of absolute terms,\u2026The object of this\npaper is to show that an affirmative answer can be given to this\nquestion. (DNLR [CP 3.45])\n\n\nBoolean logic needs to be \u201cextended\u201d if we want to cover\nthe entire realm of formal logic, Peirce states. What does Peirce mean\nby \u201cthe whole realm of formal logic\u201d? Peirce answers:\n\u201cDeductive logic can really not be understood without the study\nof the logic of relatives\u201d (1911a [CP\n 3.641]).[2]\n\nBeing encouraged by Boole\u2019s algebra of logic, but at the same\ntime taking his father, Professor Benjamin Peirce\u2019s negative\nview of logic\n seriously,[3]\n Peirce explored a way to apply Boole\u2019s method to a larger\ndomain of our reasoning so that relations may be formalized.\n\nWhat are relations and why are they so special? Let\u2019s compare\nthree sentences: \u201cJohn is an American\u201d, \u201cJohn is\ntaller than Tom\u201d, and \u201cJohn is between Tom and\nMary\u201d. The first sentence has a unary predicate \u201cis an\nAmerican\u201d, the second sentence a binary predicate \u201cis\ntaller than\u201d, and the third sentence a ternary predicate\n\u201cis between\u2026and\u2026\u201d. A unary predicate stands\nfor a property or quality, while a binary or ternary predicate stands\nfor a relation. If a first-order logical system has only unary\npredicates, then we say it is monadic. Otherwise, predicate logic is\nassumed to have binary or other higher predicates.\n\nWhen we move from monadic to polyadic logic, substantial changes take\nplace. The following three changes are at the top of the list.\nFirst of all, a move from property to relation is a territory\nexpansion. Noting that Aristotelian syllogisms are limited to unary\npredicates, one expects polyadic logic to represent more than the\nreasoning involved in Aristotelian syllogism, that is, term logic.\nSecond, monadic logic is decidable while polyadic logic is\nnot decidable, as Church\u2019s theorem proved. In some sense, as the\nterritory is expanded, we are losing its grip. Third, a\nchange in notation is inevitable, which necessitates modern\nquantification theory. How are these three important aspects are\nhandled by Peirce?\n\nThe realm of relations was a frontier where De Morgan did much of his\ncreative and novel work on\n logic.[4]\n However, his inquiry on the topic resides within the patterns of\ntraditional\n syllogisms.[5]\n Even more importantly, De Morgan did not have enough tools to\nformalize this newly extended\n realm.[6]\n Hence, not surprisingly De Morgan\u2019s relations are rather\nlimited to a certain group which fit in syllogistic reasoning. As\nMerrill points out, \n\n\nDe Morgan develops the general logic of relations only to the point\nwhere it can be used for his familiar syllogistic purposes. This means\nthat he is especially interested in relations which are convertible\nand/or transitive,\u2026. (Merrill 1990: 113) \n\n\nIt is somewhat unclear and controversial whether Peirce\u2019s\ninterest in the logic of relations started independently of De\nMorgan\u2019s work on the\n subject.[7]\n Regardless of the origin of Peirce\u2019s inquiry into relations,\nmany have come to agree that it is Peirce (not De Morgan) who\nsuccessfully formalized the logic of relations. Merrill, a De Morgan\nscholar, puts the matter in the following way:\n\n\nThe most obvious problem with this view of the proposition [De\nMorgan\u2019s way of handling relational arguments] is that it does\nnot seem general enough. If we can unite two terms into a proposition\nby relating them, why not three or four or ten terms? De\nMorgan\u2019s concern with the relational syllogism seems to have\nprecluded this generalization; but there is no reason in principle why\nit could not be made. For this, though, we must wait for Frege and\nPeirce. (Merrill 1990: 110)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Peirce\u2019s writings before 1870 DNLR show\nPeirce also attempted to solve relational arguments by traditional\nsyllogistic reasoning\n rules,[8]\n but the approach taken in DNLR is totally different\u2014not within\na syllogistic frame but by introducing Boolean algebra notation.\nPeirce must have realized the power of generalization that Boolean\nnotation could provide. Boole\u2019s algebra formalized Aristotelian\ncategorical syllogisms and opened a way for generalization of term\n logic.[9]\n Peirce, who was impressed with Boole\u2019s mathematical treatment\nof Aristotelian syllogisms, not surprisingly aimed to apply this\nmethod to relations. In that sense, modern predicate logic started in\nPeirce\u2019s 1870 pioneering work. Hence, the goal of Peirce\u2019s\nproject\u2014that is, to broaden the scope of formalization in\nlogic\u2014was a main motivation for the introduction of new\nvocabulary for quantifiers and bound variables. If so, Peirce\u2019s\ninsight early on as to the importance of reasoning involving relations\nis a key element in understanding a difference between Peirce\u2019s\nand Frege\u2019s developments of first-order\n logic.[10]\n Furthermore, the next section will show how Peirce\u2019s obsession\nwith the logic of relations led him to the invention of Existential\nGraphs.\n\nThe logic of relations formalizes a larger territory than monadic\nlogic, but there is a price to pay for obtaining the additional\nexpressive power: While monadic logic is decidable, polyadic logic is\nnot. Even though we need to wait until Church\u2019s theorem to see\nthe undecidability of first-order predicate logic, Peirce intuited a\nfundamental difference between the logic of non-relatives versus the\nlogic of relations. Here are Peirce\u2019s suggestive ideas over the\ncomparisons between monadic and relational logic: \n\n\nThe logic of relatives is highly multiform; it is characterized by\ninnumerable immediate inferences, and by various distinct conclusions\nfrom the same set of premises. (1883a [CP 3.342]) \n\n\nAnd: \n\n\n[T]he old syllogistic inference can be worked by machinery, but\ncharacteristic relative inferences cannot be performed by any mere\nmechanical rule whatever. (1896: 330) \n\n\nAs Dipert correctly points out, Peirce\u2019s remarks reveal his\n\u201cunderstanding of the richness and difficulty which\nrelations introduce into logic\u201d (Dipert 1984a:\n 63).[11]\n\nIn order to increase expressive power, Peirce left the traditional\nsyllogistic pattern and brought in Boolean algebra of logic. The\nfollowing comment emphasizes that Peirce\u2019s choice of notation\nmarks a clear departure from De Morgan\u2019s pursuit of relational\nlogic: \n\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s methodology is governed by the logic of syllogism\nwhile Peirce\u2019s methodology is entirely algebraic. This algebraic\nmodel taken over from Boole is foreign to De Morgan\u2019s methods.\nThis difference in methodology reflects a significant difference at\nthe level of definition. (Brunning 1991: 36)\n\n\nAnd after realizing the complicated nature of the logic of relations,\nPeirce explored new notation beyond Boolean calculus. That\nmove is predicted in the following passage: \n\n\nThe effect of these peculiarities [the non-mechanic nature of relative\nlogic] cannot be subjected to hard and fast rules like those of the\nBoolian calculus. (1883a [CP 3.342]) \n\n\nHere is the third aspect of a transition from monadic to polyadic\nlogic: The complication that relations bring in our reasoning,\nobviously, pushed Peirce to develop a new notational system. As the\nrest of this subsection shows, the process made over the course of 15\nyears\u2014from DNLR to \u201cOn the algebra of\nlogic\u201d\u2014is rather complicated. Importantly, Peirce\u2019s\nintroduction of quantifiers and bound variables could be seen as an\ninevitable outcome of his ambitious goal to expand the scope of\nformalization to cover relations, as Merrill says \u201cThe\nquantification complexities of many relational statements cried out\nfor quantifiers\u201d (1997: 158).\n\nThe third section of DNLR, as the title \u201cApplication of the\nAlgebraic Signs to Logic\u201d says, is one of the first places where\nBoolean algebraic notation and relational logic joined each other. In\nthe first subsection Peirce makes it clear that the territory he aims\nto cover is relational, by including polyadic predicates in the\nfollowing way: \n\n(DNLR [CP 3.63\u201364]; the entry adopts our modern terminology\ninstead of Peirce\u2019s.)\n\n\n\n\nPredicates\nPeirce\u2019s terminology\nLetters\nExamples  \n\n\nunary\nabsolute terms\n\\(\\unary{a}, \\unary{b}, \\unary{c},\\)\u2026 (Roman\nalphabet)\nFrenchman \\((\\unary{f})\\), violinist\n\\((\\unary{u})\\),\u2026 \n\nbinary\nsimple relative terms\n\\(\\binary{a}, \\binary{b}, \\binary{c}\\),\u2026 (italics)\nwife \\((\\binary{w})\\)), lover \\((\\binary{l})\\), owner \\((\\binary{o})\\),\u2026\n\n\nternary\nconjugative terms\n\\(\\ternary{a}, \\ternary{b}, \\ternary{c}\\)\u2026 (Kennerly\n[Kennerley])\ngiver to \u2014 of \u2014 \\((\\ternary{g})\\) \n\n\n\n\nFor the rest of the third section, four kinds of algebraic signs are\nintroduced to be applied on these predicate letters: the inclusion\nsign (\\(\\inclusion\\)), the addition sign (\\(\\cunion\\)), the\nmultiplication sign (juxtaposition or \u201c,\u201d), and the\ninvolution sign (exponentiation).\n\nFirst, he combines the sign equality \u201c=\u201d and the sign\n\\(<\\) for \u201cless than\u201d to come up with the sign\n\u201c\\(\\inclusion;\\)\u201d to represent inclusion:\n\n\nThus, \n\n\\[\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\unary{m}\\]\n\n\nmeans \u201cevery Frenchman is a man\u201d, without saying whether\nthere are any other men or not. So, \n\n\\[\\binary{m} \\inclusion \\binary{l}\\]\n\n\nwill mean that every mother of anything is a lover of the same thing;\nalthough this interpretation in some degree anticipates a convention\nto be made further on. (DNLR [CP 3.66])\n\n\nNote that \u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\binary{m}\\)\u201d (unlike\n\u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\inclusion \\unary{m}\\)\u201d) would be\nungrammatical since \\(\\binary{m}\\), being a binary predicate, cannot\nhave an inclusion relation with a unary predicate \\(\\unary{f}\\).\n\nFor the sign of addition, Peirce brings in Boolean sign \\(+\\), but\nwith slight variation:\n\n\nThe sign of addition is taken by Boole, so that \n\n\\[x + y\\]\n\n\ndenotes everything denoted by \\(x\\), and besides, everything\ndenoted by \\(y\\).\u2026But if there is anything which is denoted by\nboth the terms of the sum, the latter no longer stands for any logical\nterm on account of its implying that the objects denoted by one term\nare to be taken besides the objects denoted by the other. For\nexample, \n\n\\[\\unary{f} + \\unary{u}\\]\n\n\nmeans all Frenchmen besides all violinists, and, therefore, considered\nas a logical term, implies that all French violinists are besides\nthemselves. For this reason alone\u2026I preferred to take as\nthe regular addition of logic a non-invertible process, such that\n\n\\[\\unary{m} \\cunion \\unary{b}\\]\n\n\nstands for all men and black things, without implication that the\nblack things are to be taken besides the men. (DNLR [CP 3.67])\n\n\nHence, Peirce\u2019s slightly modified addition sign, \\(\\cunion\\) ,\ndenotes inclusive disjunction. \u201c\\(\\unary{f} \\cunion\n\\unary{u}\\)\u201d denotes all those who are either a Frenchman or a\nviolinist. The notation does not imply that no Frenchman is a\nviolinist or no violinist is a Frenchman. Even though Peirce\u2019s\nexample is limited to unary predicates, we can extend the idea to\nbinary. Using modern notation, \n\n\\[\\binary{l} \\cunion \\binary{s}  = \\{\\langle x, y\\rangle \\mid lover(x, y) \\lor servant(x,y)\\}.\\] \n\n That is, it corresponds to\na union of relations.\n\nWhen the multiplication sign enters the picture, the logic of\nrelations becomes powerful, and here is Peirce\u2019s hallmark for\nthe interpretation of multiplication:\n\n\nI shall adopt for the conception of multiplication the application\nof a relation, in such a way that, for example,\n\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\) shall denote whatever is a lover of a\nwoman.\u2026\\(\\binary{s}(\\unary{m} \\cunion \\unary{w})\\) will, then,\ndenote whatever is a servant of anything of the class composed of men\nand women taken together. (DNLR [CP 3.68])\n\n\nWhen polyadic predicates are in the picture, how to form a new\nrelation becomes more interesting and complicated. This is why the\nmultiplication operation of relative product is extremely important\nfor further work on relational logic. A product between two predicates\nis much more interesting than an addition between two, depending on\nwhat kinds of predicates are involved: \n\nThe product between two properties is another property, being the\nintersection between two properties, \n the product of a relation and a property is another new property,\nand \n the product between relations produces a new relation. \n\n\nLet\u2019s try to understand Peirce\u2019s concept of relative\nproduct in terms of modern terminology:\n\n\nLet\n\n\u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d be a unary predicate, being a\nwoman,\n \u201c\\(\\unary{u}\\)\u201d be a unary predicate, being a\nviolinist,\n \u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\)\u201d a binary predicate, being a lover\nof, and\n \u201c\\(\\binary{s}\\)\u201d be a binary one, being a servant of.\n\n\n\nThen,\n\n\\(\\unary{w}\\bcomma\\unary{u} = \\{x \\mid \\textit{woman}(x) \\land\n \\textit{violinist}(x)\\}\\).[12]\n\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w} = \\{ x \\mid \\exists y (\\textit{lover}(x, y)\n\\land \\textit{woman}(y))\\}\\).\n\\(\\binary{l}\\binary{s} = \\{ \\langle x, z\\rangle \\mid \\exists y\n(\\textit{lover}(x, y) \\land \\textit{servant}(y, z))\\}\\).\n\n\n\nIn this modern translation, the existence of an existential quantifier\nis noticeable, even though Peirce himself did not mention it at all in\nDNLR.\n\nHidden quantifier implication becomes even more obvious in the\noperation of involution below.\n\n\nI shall take involution in such a sense that \\(x^y\\) will denote\neverything which is an \\(x\\) for every individual of \\(y\\). Thus\n\\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\) will be a lover of every woman. (DNLR [CP\n3.77])\n\n\nThat is, \\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y\n(\\textit{woman} (y) \\rightarrow \\textit{lover} (x,y))\\}\\). Here, a\nuniversal quantifier is present!\n\nBefore we go into the details of Peirce\u2019s quantifiers,\nlet\u2019s summarize algebraic signs Peirce adopted to handle\npolyadic predicates:\n\n\n\nAlgebraic\n\nSigns\nMeanings/\n\nOperations\nExamples  \n\n\n\\(\\inclusion\\)\ninclusion\n \\(\\unary{w} \\inclusion \\unary{u}\\)\n\n\\(\\quad\\forall x (\\textit{woman} (x) \\rightarrow\n\\textit{violinist}(x))\\)\n\n\\(\\binary{l} \\inclusion \\binary{s}\\)\n\n\\(\\quad\\forall x \\forall y (\\textit{lover}(x, y) \\rightarrow\n\\textit{servant}(x, y))\\) \n\n\\(\\cunion\\)\nunion\n\\(\\unary{w} \\cunion \\binary{u}\\)\n\n\\(\\quad\\{ x\\mid \\textit{woman}(x) \\lor \\textit{violinist}(x)\\}\\)\n\n\\(\\binary{l} \\cunion \\binary{s}\\)\n\n\\(\\quad\\{ \\langle x, y \\rangle \\mid \\textit{lover}(x,y) \\lor\n\\textit{servant} (x, y)\\}\\) \n\n\\(\\bcomma\\)\nintersection\n\\(\\unary{w}\\bcomma \\unary{u}\\)\n\n\\(\\quad\\{ x\\mid \\textit{woman}(x) \\land \\textit{violinist}(x)\\}\\)\n\n\n(no comma)\nrelative product\n\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\) (a lover of some woman)\n\n\\(\\quad\\{ x \\mid \\exists y (\\textit{lover}(x, y) \\land\n\\textit{woman}(y))\\}\\)\n\n\\(\\binary{l}\\binary{s} = \\{ \\langle x, z \\rangle \\mid \\exists y\n(\\textit{lover}(x, y) \\land \\textit{servant}(y, z)\\}\\) \n\n\\(x^y\\)\n\\(x\\) of every \\(y\\)\n \\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\) (a lover of every woman)\n\n\\(\\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{woman} (y) \\rightarrow \\textit{lover}\n(x,y)\\}\\)  \n\n\nLet\u2019s focus on hidden but assumed presence of quantifiers in the\ncase of multiplication and exponentiation: \\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\) is\ninterpreted as \u201ca lover of some woman\u201d and\n\\(l^{\\unary{w}}\\) as \u201ca lover of every woman\u201d.\nInterestingly, in the process of introducing polyadic predicates,\nPeirce ends up bringing in quantifiers, some and\nevery. On the other hand, considering that Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogisms have two quantifiers, Peirce\u2019s algebraic notation for\nquantifiers\u2014some and every\u2014should not\nsurprise us. However, a crucial aspect of this development is that\nBoole\u2019s unsatisfactory representation of existential\npropositions (as opposed to universal propositions) pushed Peirce and\nhis student O. H. Mitchell to go beyond Boole\u2019s\n logic.[13]\n The way Peirce interprets a relative\nproduct\u2014\u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\u201d meaning\n\u201clover of some woman\u201d\u2014allows an existential\nquantifier to be expressed implicitly in terms of multiplication.\n\nLet us see several different ways Peirce pursued to represent\nexistential statements in a more explicit way. In the above for\n\u201c\\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, the existential quantifier is\ncarried out in the way relation \\(\\binary{l}\\) is applied to a unary\npredicate \u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, but not explicitly. There are\nseveral different explicit ways Peirce represents existential\nstatements. One method: borrowing exponentiation (in which a binary\npredicate is applied to a unary predicate, e.g.,\n\\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\)), Peirce expresses an existential statement\nas a contradiction of a universal statement:\n\n\nParticular [existential] propositions are expressed by the\nconsideration that they are contradictory of universal propositions.\nThus, as \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})=0\\) means every horse is\nblack, so \\(0^{\\unary{h}, (1-\\unary{b})} = 0\\) means that some horse\nis not black; and as \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma \\unary{b}= 0\\) means that no\nhorse is black, so \\(0^{\\unary{h}, \\unary{b}} = 0\\) means that some\nhorse is black. (DNLR [CP 3.141])\n\n\nThe number 1 represents the universe class and 0 the null class.\nHowever, Peirce\u2019s notation of exponentiation whose base is 0 has\nsome slightly different nuance. Let\u2019s recall Peirce\u2019s\nexponentiation operation: \n\n\\[\n\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{woman} (y)  \\rightarrow \\textit{lover}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n0^{0} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{null-class}(y)  \\rightarrow  \\textit{null-relation}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n[Note: The base 0 denotes a relation\u2014the null relation, while\nthe exponent 0 a class\u2014the null class.]\n\nThere is no \\(y\\) such that \\(\\textit{null-class}(y)\\), since noting\ncould be in the null-class. Hence, vacuously, every object in\nthe domain gets in \\(0^{0}\\). That is, the class of things which has\nno relation to the null class is the universe class which is\nrepresented by 1. Hence, \\(0^{0} = 1\\).\n\n\nSuppose \\(\\unary{m}\\not = 0\\). \n\n\\[\n0^{\\unary{m}} = \\{ x \\mid \\forall y (\\textit{non-null-class}(y)  \\rightarrow  \\textit{null-relation}(x,y))\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSince nothing can bear the null-relation to every member of any\nnon-null class, \\(0^{\\unary{m}} = 0\\). Hence, we get the following\nexponentiation notation:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{*}     \n\\begin{align}\n0^x = 0    &\\quad \\textrm{if } x \\not =0\\\\\n0^x = 1 &\\quad \\textrm{if } x  =0\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing this result, let\u2019s unpack Peirce\u2019s above\nquotation:\n\n1 represents the universe class and 0 the null class.\n(Boolean symbols)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})\\)\u201d denotes\nthe class of non-black horses. (Multiplication operation for\nintersection)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b})=0\\)\u201d says\nthat there is nothing that is non-black horse. I.e., every horse is\nblack. (by\n 1\n and\n 2)\n\u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma(1-\\unary{b}) \\not = 0\\)\u201d\nmeans it is not the case that every horse is black. I.e., some horse\nis not black. (by\n 3)\nSince \\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma (1-\\unary{b}) \\not = 0,\n0^{\\unary{h},(1-\\unary{b})} = 0\\) (by\n (*)\n above)\n\n\nSimilarly, \u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma\\unary{b}=0\\)\u201d means no\nhorse is black. Hence, \u201c\\(\\unary{h}\\bcomma \\unary{b} \\not =\n0\\)\u201d says some horse is black. Therefore,\n\u201c\\(0^{\\unary{h}\\bcomma\\unary{b}} = 0\\)\u201d (being the\nexponent being not-zero) means that some horse is black.\n\nThe method presented in DNLR [CP 3.141] is interesting for several reasons.\nFirst of all, Peirce maintains Boole\u2019s theme that all\npropositions are represented as equations. Another is that Peirce\nutilizes the contradictory relation between universal and existential\npropositions. Even more interestingly and importantly, Peirce brings\nin his exponentiation notation, exponentiation between relation to\nproperty (that is, between binary to unary predicates), to express\nexistential statements.\n\nAfter the rather complicated presentation of existential statements,\nfocusing on the exponent part, Peirce suggests another, much simpler,\nway to express existential statements by using the inequality\nsign:\n\n\nParticular [Existential] propositions may also be expressed by means\nof the signs of inequality. Thus, some animals are horses, may be\nwritten \\(\\unary{a}\\bcomma\\unary{h} > 0\\). (DNLR [CP 3.143])\n\n\nAnother method Peirce adopts is to utilize the sign \\(\\inclusion\\) for\ninclusion and the sign \\(\\bar{ \\ \\ }\\) for complement. That is,\n\n\n All \\(a\\) is \\(b\\).\n \\(a \\inclusion b\\)\n\n No \\(a\\) is \\(b\\). \n \\(a \\inclusion \\bar{b}\\)\n\n Some \\(a\\) is \\(b\\). \n \\(\\overline{[a \\inclusion \\bar{b}]}\\)\n\n Some \\(a\\) is not \\(b\\). \n \\(\\overline{[a \\inclusion b]}\\)\n\n\nHowever, these explicit ways to handle existential statements are\nlimited to unary predicates or Aristotelian syllogisms, and cannot go\nbeyond them. Instead, we would like to examine Peirce\u2019s\nmultiplication and exponential expressions between relations and\nproperties more carefully. Let\u2019s recall \\(\\binary{l}\\unary{w}\\)\nmeans \u201ca lover of some woman\u201d while\n\\(\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}}\\) \u201ca lover of every woman\u201d. Here\nPeirce\u2019s proposal for individual terms gets in the picture so\nthat existential and universal quantifiers may become more explicitly\nrepresented. Peirce suggests individuals be denoted by capitals (DNLR\n[CP 3.96]). For example, for unary predicate \\(\\unary{w}\\), if\n\\(\\unary{w} > 0\\), then \\(\\unary{w} = \\unary{W}' \\cunion\n\\unary{W}'' \\cunion \\unary{W}''' \\cunion \\cdots\\),\nwhere each of \\(\\unary{W}'\\), \\(\\unary{W}''\\),\n\\(\\unary{W}'''\\),\u2026denotes an individual woman.\nHence, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\binary{l}\\unary{w} & = \\binary{l}(\\unary{W}' \\cunion  \\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots)\\\\\n&= \\binary{l}\\unary{W}' \\cunion  \\binary{l}\\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\binary{l}\\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots\\\\\n\\binary{l}^{\\unary{w}} &= \\binary{l}^{(\\unary{W} ' \\cunion      \\unary{W}'' \\cunion  \\unary{W}''' \\cunion  \\cdots)}\\\\\n& = \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}'}, \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}''}, \\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}'''},\\ldots\\\\\n& = \\binary{l}\\unary{W}', \\binary{l}\\unary{W}'', \\binary{l}\\unary{W}''',\\ldots (\\binary{l}^{\\unary{W}}=\\binary{l}\\unary{W}, \\unary{W} \\textrm{ being an individual term.})\n  \\end{align}\n  \\]\n\n\nAt this point, Peirce makes a connection (i) between existential\nstatements and the sign \\(\\Sigma\\) (as logical addition) and (ii)\nbetween universal statements and \\(\\Pi\\) (as logical multiplication),\nand the following passage is a precursor for the notations which\nappear in subsequent papers: \n\n\\[\\Pi' \\inclusion \\Sigma',\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Pi'\\) and \\(\\Sigma'\\) signify that the addition and\nthe multiplication with commas are to be used. From this it follows\nthat \n\n\\[s^{\\unary{w}} \\inclusion s\\unary{w}. \\qquad \\textrm{(DNLR [CP 3.97])}\\]\n\n\nWe have now come quite close to a modern notation of quantifiers.\nDipert emphasizes the significance of Peirce\u2019s notations found\nin DNLR:\n\n\nC. S. Peirce was the first person in the history of logic to use\nquantifier-like variable binding operators (briefly in 1870, W2, 392f,\npredating Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879)). (Dipert\n2004: 290)\n\n\nTen years later, in a more comprehensive and more survey-style paper,\n\u201cOn the algebra of logic\u201d (1880), we find Peirce\u2019s\nideas of DNLR emerge more tightly and more systematically. Below we\nwill now summarize the developments of quantification presented in\n\u201cBrief description of the algebra of relatives\u201d (1882a),\n\u201cThe logic of relatives\u201d (1883a), and \u201cOn the\nalgebra of logic: A contribution to the philosophy of notations\u201d\n(1885a plus 1885b).\n\nFirst, he modifies the previous idea of representing a property in\nterms of individual terms and extends it to relations. In DNLR (1870),\n\u201c\\(\\unary{w}\\)\u201d, which stands for the property\n\u201cbeing a woman\u201d, is expressed as \n\n \\[\\unary{w} = \\unary{W}' + \\unary{W}'' + \\unary{W}''' + \\cdots\\] \n\n\n(where \\(\\unary{W}'\\),\u2026 denotes each individual woman).\nHowever, in 1882a, Peirce expresses a unary predicate using\ncoefficients: For each unary predicate \\(x\\) and for each object \\(a\\)\nin the domain, Peirce defines the coefficient \\((x)_a\\) in the following way.\n\nContinuing the example for the unary predicate \\(\\unary{w},\\) suppose\nthe domain has objects \\(\\unary{A},\\) \\(\\unary{B},\\)\n \\(\\unary{C},\\)\u2026.[14]\n Some object is a woman and some is not. A coefficient\n\\((\\unary{w})_a\\) is defined as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\unary{w})_{a} A & = 1 \\textrm{ if } A \\textrm{ is woman.}\\\\\n& = 0 \\textrm{ if } A \\textrm{ is not a woman.}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\unary{w} & = (w)_{a} A  + (w)_{b} B+ (w)_{c} C + \\cdots\\\\\n&  = \\Sigma_{i} (w)_{i} \\binary{I}.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nA unary predicate is successfully represented as a sum of individuals.\nMoving on to a binary predicate, a relation is modeled by a pair of\n objects:[15]\n\n\nA dual relative term [binary predicate], such as \u201clover\u201d,\n\u201cbenefactor\u201d, \u201cservant\u201d, is a common name\nsignifying a pair of objects. (1883a [CP 3.328])\n\n\nAnd he expresses a pair of objects as \u201c\\(A:B\\)\u201d, where\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are individual objects. Let \\(\\binary{l}\\) stand for\n\u201ca lover\u201d. Peirce defines a coefficient for each ordered\npair of objects in the following way: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(\\binary{l})_{i, j} (A_i: A_j) & = 1 \\textrm{ if } A_i \\textrm{ is a lover of } A_j.\\\\\n& = 0 \\textrm{ if } A_i \\textrm{ is not a lover of } A_j.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\binary{l} & = (l)_{1,1}(A_{1}: A_{1}) + (l)_{1,2}(A_{1}: A_{2})  + (l)_{2,1}(A_{2}: A_{1}) + (l)_{2,2}(A_{2}: A_{2})  + \\cdots\\\\\n&  = \\Sigma_{i} \\Sigma_{j}(l)_{i,j}(A_i: A_j).\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s generalization for a unary predicate \\(\\unary{x}\\) and\na binary predicate \\(\\binary{l}\\) goes like this (1883a [CP\n3.329]): \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\unary{x} & = \\Sigma_{i} (\\unary{x})_i \\binary{I} & \\textrm{ (1882a [CP 3.306])}\\\\\n\\binary{l} & =  \\Sigma_{i} \\Sigma_{j}(\\binary{l})_{i,j}(I: J) &\\textrm{ (1883a [CP 3.329])}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThis is what Peirce had in mind when he wrote \u201cEvery term\n[predicate] may be conceived as a limitless logical sum of\nindividuals\u201d (1880 [CP 3.217]). We take only objects whose\ncoefficients are 1. Suppose \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(D\\) are women.\nApplying Peirce\u2019s sign \u201c+\u201d as inclusive-or,\n\\(\\unary{w} = \\{ A, B, D\\}\\). Suppose \\(A\\) is a lover of \\(C\\), and\n\\(B\\) is a lover of \\(D\\). Then, \\(l = \\{( A: C),\n(B:\n D)\\}\\).[16]\n\nThe next task is how to utilize this tool to express an existential\nproposition. If there is at least one woman, say \\(K\\), in the domain,\nthere is at least one coefficient \\(\\unary{w}_k\\) such that it is 1.\nHence, the sum of coefficients of the individuals in the domain is\ngreater than 0. That is, \\(\\Sigma_{i} w_i > 0\\). If nobody is a\nwoman, we will get \\(\\Sigma_{i} w_i = 0\\). In the case of the\nuniversal proposition that everybody is a woman, the product of\ncoefficients is 0 as long as one coefficient is 0, that is, there is\none person who is not a woman. That is, \\(\\Pi_{i} w_i = 0\\). When\neverybody is a woman, \\(\\Pi _{i} w_i = 1\\).\n\nWhile the Boolean approach for quantifiers is limited to term logic,\nthis way of handling quantifiers is so general that we can apply it\ndirectly to relations as well, as the following passage states:\n\n\nAny proposition whatever is equivalent to saying that some complexus\nof aggregates [sums] and products of such numerical coefficients is\ngreater than zero. Thus, \n\n\\[\\Sigma_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij} > 0\\]\n\n\nmeans that something is a lover of something; and \n\n\\[\\Pi_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij} > 0.\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is a lover of something. (1883a [CP 3.351])\n\n\nAnd Peirce proposes to drop the \\(\u201c>0\u201d\\) part:\n\n\nWe shall, however, naturally omit, in writing the inequality, the\n\\(\u201c>0\u201d\\) which terminates them all; and the above two\npropositions will appear as\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma_{i}\\Sigma_{j} \\binary{l}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\Pi_{i}\\Sigma_{j}\n\\binary{l}_{ij}.\\qquad\\) (1883a [CP 3.351])\n\n\n\nGetting to Peirce\u2019s 1883 paper, we witness two significant steps\ntaken: One is the use of index-subscripts in a crucial way, and the\nother is the alternation of \\(\\Sigma\\) and \\(\\Pi\\). After dropping\n\u201c\\(>0\\)\u201d Peirce draws our attention to the role of\nsubscripts:\n\n\nThe following are other examples: \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (l)_{ij} (b)_{ij}\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is at once a lover and a benefactor of\nsomething. \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (l)_{ij} (b)_{ji}\\]\n\n\nmeans that everything is a lover of a benefactor of itself. (1883a [CP 3.352])\n\n\nThe order of index-subscripts is crucial to make a distinction between\nthese two propositions. On the other hand, a difference between\n\u201cEverybody loves some woman\u201d and \u201cThere is a woman\neverybody loves\u201d relies on the order of \\(\\Pi\\) and\n\\(\\Sigma\\): \n\n\\[\\Pi_i \\Sigma_j (\\binary{l})_{ij} ({\\unary{w}})_j    \\quad \\textrm{ vs.}\\quad  \\Sigma_j \\Pi_i  (\\binary{l})_{ij }({\\unary{w}})_j.\\]\n\n\nFinally in \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A contribution to the\nphilosophy of notation\u201d (1885a) all of these\ndevelopments\u2014(i) \\(\\Sigma\\) (sum) for some and \\(\\Pi\\)\n(product) for all, (ii) utilizing coefficients and their\nsubscripts to drop denotation of individuals (e.g., from \\((l)_{ij}\n(A_{i}: A_{j})\\) to \\((l)_{ij}\\)), (iii) mixing \\(\\Sigma\\) and\n\\(\\Pi\\), and (iv) omitting the \u201c\\(>0\\)\u201d part\u2014have\nbecome official:\n\n\nIn general, according to 1885a [CP 3.393]:\n\n\n\\(\\Sigma_i x_i\\) means that \\(x\\) is true of some one of the\nindividuals noted by \\(i\\) or \n\n   \\[\\Sigma_{i}x_i = x_i + x_j + x_k + \\textit{etc.}\\]\n\n\nIn the same way, \\(\\Pi_i x_i\\) means that \\(x\\) is true of all these\nindividuals, or \n\n     \\[\\Pi_{i}x_i = x_i   x_j   x_k, \\textit{etc.}\\]\n\n\nAnd if \\(x\\) is a simple relation [binary predicate],\n\n \\(\\Pi_i\\Pi_j x_{i,j}\\) means that every \\(i\\) is in this relation\nto every \\(j\\),\n \\(\\Pi_j\\Sigma_i x_{i,j}\\) that every \\(j\\) some \\(i\\) or other is\nin this relation,\n \\(\\Sigma_i\\Sigma_j x_{i,j}\\) that some \\(i\\) is in this relation\nto some \\(j\\).\n \nFor example, according to 1885a [CP 3.394]:\n\n\nLet \\(l_{ij}\\) mean that \\(i\\) is a lover of \\(j\\) and \\(b_{ij}\\) that\n\\(i\\) is a benefactor of \\(j\\).\n\nLet \\(g_i\\) mean that \\(i\\) is a griffin, and \\(c_i\\) that \\(i\\) is a\nchimera.\n\nThen \\(\\Pi_i\\Sigma_j (l)_{ij }(b)_{ij}\\) means that everything is at\nonce a lover and a benefactor of something; and\n\n [I.e., \\(\\forall x \\exists y [\\textit{Lover} (x, y) \\land\n\\textit{Benefactor} (x, y)]\\), meaning that everybody is a lover and a\nbenefactor of someone.]\n\n\nAnd \\(\\Pi_i\\Sigma_j (l)_{ij}(b)_{ji}\\) means that everything is a\nlover of a benefactor of itself.\n\n [I.e., \\(\\forall x \\exists y [\\textit{Lover} (x, y) \\land\n\\textit{Benefactor} (y, x)]\\), meaning that everybody is a lover of a\nbenefactor of himself/herself.]\n \n\n\nAnd we find ourselves arriving at the land of modern logic. At the\nsame time, we realize that the key concepts and vocabulary of\nfirst-order logic were already formed in his previous work discussed\nabove. We also note that the goal outlined in the first section of the\n1885 paper is more or less the same as the proposal made in his 1870\npaper: \u201cThe first is the extension of the power of logical\nalgebra over the whole of its proper realm\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]).\nAlso, he almost reiterates the limit of the project which he\n\u201cregrets\u201d in 1870: \u201cI shall not be able to perfect\nthe algebra sufficiently to give facile methods of reaching logical\nconclusions\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]). That is, we should not expect a\nfull-blown deductive system in this paper, but \u201cI can only give\na method by which any legitimate conclusion may be reached and any\nfallacious one avoided\u201d (1885a [CP 3.364]). He carries out his\npromise in section 3 of the paper titled as \u201c\u00a73.\nFirst-intentional logic of\n relatives\u201d,[17]\n by suggesting a list of methods of transformation. He did not mean to\nclaim this list is exhaustive, but \u201cthe one which seems to me\nthe most useful tool on the whole\u201d (1885a [CP 3.396]). The\nfollowing are some of the rules involving\n quantifiers:[18]\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall x  \\phi(x) \\land \\forall y \\phi(y) & = \\forall x\\forall y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\exists x  \\phi(x) \\land \\forall y \\phi(y) & = \\exists  x\\forall y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\exists x  \\phi(x) \\land \\exists y \\phi(y) & = \\exists x\\exists y (\\phi(x) \\land \\phi(y))\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\forall x   \\forall y \\chi(x,y)   & = \\forall y\\forall x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\exists x   \\exists y \\chi(x,y)  & = \\exists  y\\exists x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\forall x   \\exists y (\\phi(x) \\land \\psi(y))  & = \\exists  y\\forall x  (\\phi(x) \\land \\psi(y))\\\\\n\\forall x   \\exists y \\chi(x,y)   & \\not = \\exists  y\\forall x  \\chi(x,y), \\textrm{ but}\\\\ \n\\exists  x\\forall y  \\chi(x,y)   & \\Rightarrow  \\forall y   \\exists x \\chi(x,y)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\exists x   \\forall y \\chi(x,y) = \\exists x   \\forall y (\\chi(x,y)\\land \\chi(x,x))\\]\n\n\nIn spite of the six-year interval between Frege\u2019s\nBegriffsschrift (1879) and Peirce\u2019s quantification\ntheory in 1885, credit has been given to both logicians. We call them\nboth the founders of modern logic, since Peirce was not aware of\nFrege\u2019s work on the topic. Also, it should be noted that Frege\npresented a logical system equipped with axioms and rules, which was\nnot pursued in Peirce\u2019s work.\n",
