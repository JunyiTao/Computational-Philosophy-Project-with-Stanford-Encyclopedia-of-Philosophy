    "main_text": "The Nature of Law || The Doctrinal Concept of Law in Economic Analysis of Law\n3.2 The Doctrinal Concept of Law in Economic Analysis of Law\n\nThe prior section identified a plethora of concepts of law. On which\nof these concepts does economic analysis of law rely? On which of\nthese concepts does it shed light? This section addresses these\nquestions with respect to the doctrinal concept of law that lies at\nthe center of legal practice. The next section addresses these\nquestions with respect to the sociological concept of law that might\nplay a role in the development of social theory.\n\nMost doctrinal analyses take the \u201clegal materials\u201d as\ngiven. They seek to rationalize the decisions of some set of courts.\nAny concept of law that identifies the materials as the relevant ones\nto rationalize serves the doctrinal analysts\u2019 purposes.\n\nPolicy analysis and political economy have also largely been silent\nabout the doctrinal concept of law on which they rely or shed light.\nEach has largely put the questions that motivate the debates over the\nconcept of law to one side.\n\nAn economic analysis of the behavioral effects of a legal rule\ngenerally begins with the assumption that the legal rule is clearly\nknown not only to judges and other public officials but also to those\nsubject to the legal rule. This knowledge of private citizens might\namount simply to the knowledge of what consequences follow from each\npossible action the agent might take. Actions that provoke a response\nfrom public officials generally, or judges in particular, have no\nspecial character to them; the citizen in her deliberations treats the\nconsequences of rule-following or rule-breaking as she treats any\nother price.\n\nSimilarly, investigations into the causes of legal rules and\ninstitutions typically take the background institutions and rules as\ngiven and, generally, known to all parties. It is not clear that the\nanalysis attributes any special character to legal rules and\ninstitutions other than, perhaps, centralized legislation,\nadjudication, and\n enforcement.[16]\n Thus political economy, like policy analysis, seems agnostic about\nthe central philosophical questions. Nothing in the analysis requires\nthat legal rules be distinctive in any way. Indeed, radical political\neconomy holds that self-interest governs individual and institutional\naction all the way down. It leaves no room for any normative force to\nlaw. \n\nThis agnosticism about the doctrinal concept of law is, on two\naccounts, harmless. First, as Murphy [2014] argues, competing\npositions on the role of morality in the truth conditions of\npropositions of law do not have many, if any, substantive consequences\nfor the practice of law. Ignoring the doctrinal concept of law thus\nhas no substantive consequence for economic analyses of these rules.\n\n\nSecond, as argued in Kornhauser [2015], a doctrinal concept of law is\nunnecessary for the practice of law. What legal theory requires is not\na doctrinal concept of law but a set of theories of decision-making\nfor various agents\u2014judges, legislators, public officials, and\ncitizens. \n",
