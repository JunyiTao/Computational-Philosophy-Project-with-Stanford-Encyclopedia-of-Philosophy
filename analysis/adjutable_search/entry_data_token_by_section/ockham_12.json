But when it comes to paring down the number of basic\nontological categories, he is more cautious, and it is there that he\nuses his Razor ruthlessly\u2014always to suspend judgment, never to\ndeny.\n\nThe main vehicle for this \u201contological reduction\u201d is the\ntheory of connotation, coupled with the related theory of\n\u201cexposition.\u201d The theory of exposition, which is not fully\ndeveloped in Ockham, will become increasingly prominent in authors\nimmediately after him. In effect, the theory of connotation is related\nto the theory of exposition as explicit definition is related to\ncontextual definition. The notion of the \u201csquare\u201d of a\nnumber can be explicitly defined, for example, as the result of\nmultiplying that number by itself. Contextual definition operates not\nat the level of terms, but at the level of propositions. Thus,\nBertrand Russell famously treated \u2018The present king of France is\nbald\u2019 as amounting to \u2018There is an x such that\nx is a present king of France and x is bald, and for\nall y if y is a present king of France then\ny = x\u2019. We are never given any outright\ndefinition of the term \u2018present king of France\u2019, but\ninstead are given a technique of paraphrasing away seemingly\nreferential occurrences of that term in such a way that we are not\ncommitted to any actually existing present kings of France. So too,\nOckham tries to provide us, at the propositional level, with\nparaphrases of propositions that seem at first to refer to entities he\nsees no reason to believe\n in.[33]\n\nFor example, in Summa of Logic, II.11, among other places,\nOckham argues that we can account for the truth of \u2018Socrates is\nsimilar to Plato\u2019 without having to appeal to a relational\nentity called \u201csimilarity\u201d:\n\nFor example, for the truth of \u2018Socrates is similar to\nPlato\u2019, it is required that Socrates have some quality and that\nPlato have a quality of the same species. Thus, from the very fact\nthat Socrates is white and Plato is white, Socrates is similar to\nPlato and conversely. Likewise, if both are black, or hot, [then] they\nare similar without anything else added. (Emphasis added.)\n\n\nIn\n this way, Ockham removes all need for entities in seven of the\ntraditional Aristotelian ten categories; all that remain are entities\nin the categories of substance and quality, and a few entities in the\ncategory of relation, which Ockham thinks are required for theological\nreasons pertaining to the Trinity, the Incarnation and the Eucharist,\neven though our natural cognitive powers would see no reason for them\nat\n all.[34]\n As is to be expected, the ultimate success of Ockham\u2019s program\nis a matter of considerable\n dispute.[35]\n\nIt should be stressed again, however, that this program in no way\nrequires that it should be possible to dispense altogether with terms\nfrom any of the ten Aristotelian categories (relational and\nquantitative terms in particular). Ockham\u2019s claim is simply that\nall our basic scientific terms, whether absolute or connotative,\nsignify nothing but singular substances or qualities (plus some\nsingular relations in certain exceptional theological cases).\n",
