McTaggart\u2019s Philosophy of Religion\n\n\nAlthough McTaggart was an atheist from a very early age, he was\ncertainly a religious person, at least on his own definition of\n\u201creligion\u201d. In chapter 1 of Some Dogmas of\nReligion, McTaggart defined \u201creligion\u201d as \u201can\nemotion that rests on a conviction of harmony between ourselves and the\nuniverse at large.\u201d According to McTaggart, a necessary condition\non judging that there is harmony between the universe at large and\nourselves is that one judge that the universe is good on the whole\n(Some Dogmas of Religion, section 11).\n\n\nIn an earlier pamphlet, titled \u201cDare to Be Wise\u201d\n(reprinted in his Philosophical Studies), McTaggart defined\n\u201cpessimism\u201d as the view that the universe as a whole is\nmore bad than good, and \u201coptimism\u201d as the view that the\nuniverse as a whole is more good than bad. According to\nMcTaggart, whether optimism is true is one of the central religious\nquestions. Probably no philosophical belief was more important to\nMcTaggart than optimism. McTaggart defended optimism very early in his\ncareer, in a pamphlet published in 1893 titled \u201cOn the\nFurthermore determination of the Absolute\u201d (reprinted in his\nPhilosophical Studies), and the second volume of the\nNature of Existence concludes with a full-throttled argument for\noptimism. \n\nHowever, McTaggart denied that the truth of optimism required the truth\nof theism. As noted earlier, McTaggart was throughout his adult life an\nunwavering atheist. In chapter VI of Some Dogmas of Religion,\nMcTaggart defines \u201cGod\u201d as \u201ca being who is personal,\nsupreme, and good.\u201d Although McTaggart\u2019s definition\nrequires that God be a person in the philosophical sense, it neither\nrequires that God be omnipotent nor requires that God be\nomnibenevolent. It merely requires that God be more powerful than any\ncreated thing and that God be more good than evil. McTaggart held that\nthe three most popular arguments for the existence of God, which he\ntook to be the cosmological argument, the argument from design, and the\nargument from goodness, cannot prove the existence of an omnipotent\nGod. McTaggart also raises worries in this chapter about the coherence\nof the notion of omnipotence by calling attention to various paradoxes\nand puzzles surrounding the notion. It should be noted that\nMcTaggart\u2019s conception of omnipotence is very strong: for one to\nbe omnipotent in his sense one must be able to perform impossible\ntasks.\n\nSome Dogmas of Religion does not contain a direct argument for\nthe non-existence of God, but rather contains rebuttals of arguments\nfor the existence of God. The Nature of Existence does\ncontain a direct argument for atheism, which appears in chapter 43 of\nvolume II. This argument is roughly as follows. At this point in the\nbook, McTaggart believes that he has established that the universe\nconsists of some number of immaterial spirits, each of which is a\nprimary part of the universe. Roughly, to say that the\nxs form primary parts of y is to say that the way of\ncarving up y into the xs is a privileged or\nfundamental way of carving up y. For an intuitive example,\nconsider a sphere whose top half is blue and whose bottom half is red.\nPerhaps the sphere has infinitely many arbitrary undetached parts, but\nthe way of carving the sphere into the top and the bottom half is a\nprivileged way of carving it. McTaggart then argues that, if there is a\nGod, then it is either identical with the sum of all that exists, or is\nthe creator of all that is distinct from God, or is the mere guider and\nshaper of all that is distinct from God. God cannot be the sum of all\nthat exists, since then God would be a person who is composed of other\npersons. But according to McTaggart, no person can have as a part\nanother\n person.[11]\n\nSecond, God cannot be the creator of all else that exists.\nAccording to McTaggart, that would make God more fundamental than any\nof the other selves that are primary parts of the universe. But all\nselves are equally fundamental. McTaggart has a second argument for the\nconclusion that God cannot be the creator of everything else that\nexists. According to McTaggart, nothing is truly in time. Since time is\nunreal, there can be no creation. However, even if time is unreal,\nMcTaggart believes that we can truly say of two things that there is a\ncausal relation between them. But, if time is unreal, this relation\nmust be symmetric; in order to distinguish the cause from the effect,\nMcTaggart holds that we must appeal to temporal asymmetries, none of\nwhich exist. Since creation is an asymmetric causal relation, and there\nare no such relations if time is unreal, there is no creation, and\nhence God cannot be identified with the creator of everything that is\nnot identical with God. For similar reasons, McTaggart held that there\ncannot be a being who is the shaper and guider of everything that is\nnot him.\n\nMcTaggart was a mystic. McTaggart held that there are two essential\ncharacteristics of mysticism. (These two characteristics are\narticulated in his article \u201cMysticism\u201d, which is reprinted\nin Philosophical Studies.) First, mysticism requires the\nrecognition of a unity of the universe that is greater than that\nrecognized by ordinary experience or by science. The universe might be\nhighly unified without it being the case that the apparently\nnumerically distinct parts of the universe are actually identical.\nAccording to McTaggart, Hegel believed in a mystic unity although he\ndid not believe that this unity amounted to numerical identity. On\nMcTaggart\u2019s interpretation, Hegel identified God as a community\nof finite spirits. McTaggart\u2019s own view was substantially the\nsame, although he did not label the community of spirits\n\u201cGod\u201d.\n\n\nA second essential characteristic of mysticism is the view that it\nis possible to be conscious of this unity in a way different from that\nof ordinary discursive thought. We can be conscious of abstract truths\nor of spiritual reality directly in a matter akin to sense perception.\nMcTaggart calls this consciousness \u201cmystic intuition\u201d, and\nthat of which it is a recognition \u201cmystic unity\u201d. Mystic\nunity is more fundamental than mystic intuition. The existence of\nmystic intuition implies the existence of mystic unity, but the clearly\nthe converse does not hold. The universe might be highly unified\nwithout anyone recognizing that it is so.\n\nFrom a very early age, McTaggart had what he took to be mystical\nexperiences. These experiences presented the world as being\nfundamentally unified by the relation of love. Reality as it appeared\nto him in these experiences consisted fundamentally of immaterial\nspirits who stand in the relation of love to one another. These\nexperiences provided him with great comfort, but he believed that the\nfact that he had them did not provide others with a reason to believe\nin the unity he took them to\n reveal.[12]\nPhilosophical argument was needed to supply\nothers with a reason.\n\nIn general, McTaggart held that religious (or metaphysical) beliefs\ncannot rest merely on the unfounded convictions of believers, or on\nthe claim that most people believe it, or on that we must believe it\nin order to be happy, or that we should believe it on faith (Some\nDogmas of Religion, section 31).  With respect to matters of\nmetaphysics, we need arguments. According to McTaggart, we also need\nthe courage to search for the truth and to follow the arguments were\nthey lead, even when are unhappy with where they lead. Since\nexperience cannot correct the beliefs of metaphysicians, if a lack of\ncourage leads them astray, nothing will lead them back to the\ntruth. We do not want to be driven to false\ncomfort.[13]\n\nAlthough McTaggart denied the reality of time, he did in a sense defend\nthe immortality of the self. Since some judgments about time can be\nwell-founded even though false, it might be that judgments about\nwhether we will enjoy life again after our deaths are well-founded.\nMcTaggart held that they were, and moreover defended the view that each\nof us existed prior to our births as\n well.[14]\n",
