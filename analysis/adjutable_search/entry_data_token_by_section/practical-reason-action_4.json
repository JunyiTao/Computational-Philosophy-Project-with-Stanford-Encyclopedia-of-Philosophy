    "main_text": "Evaluation as Essential to Action\n5. Evaluation as Essential to Action\n\nWe will review two variants of the thesis that evaluation is\nan essential feature of action, or of a privileged kind of action,\ndue, respectively, to Sarah Buss and Talbot Brewer.\n\nBuss distinguishes between mere \u201cmovements of the human\nbody\u201d and full fledged intentional action by requiring, for the\nlatter, that agents endorse their actions at the time they are\ninitiated; the content of the endorsement must in one way or another\ncome to allowing the agent\u2019s reasons to be sufficient for performing\nthe action (Buss 1999). Anything short of that, she argues, amounts to\nadopting a spectatorial stance towards your own actions: if you\nidentify a number of desires, notice that you could satisfy them by\nperforming an action, but then don\u2019t arrive at an evaluative belief\nwith roughly the content that that\u2019s good enough to go ahead, you will\nbe doing no more than sitting back to see what happens \u2013 to see\nwhether the desires actuate your body. \n\nBuss then considers a Humean moral psychology on which reasons for\naction are drawn from two mutually exclusive classes of psychological\nstates, desires and beliefs, where beliefs are understood to have no\nproperly evaluative content (e.g., Smith, 1987). Since such a moral\npsychology has no room for evaluative beliefs, and since intentional\naction requires one particular sort of evaluative belief, Humean moral\npsychology is, she concludes, incompatible with there being\nintentional actions. It evidently follows that a theory of practical\nreasoning which presupposes Humean moral psychology cannot allow for\nintentional action, either. (There is a little bit of slippage here:\none might allow for the evaluations, but then insist that these could\nnot figure into practical reasoning. But this would be an awkward way\nof resisting the conclusion.) Theories of practical reasoning which\nidentify reasons for action solely with desires and beliefs so\ncharacterized \u2013 so-called Humean theories \u2013 are directed\ntowards choosing actions, yet incompatible with actions being chosen.\nThe conclusion we are invited to draw is that Humean theories of\npractical reasoning are incoherent. A dramatic way of putting it might\nbe: if your will is to be free, instrumentalism must be false.\n\nThere is evident overlap between Buss\u2019s view and Velleman\u2019s: both\npivot on the concern that one act for one\u2019s (sufficient or good enough\nor best) reasons. (In Velleman, that concern appears as a desire,\nwhere in Buss, it appears as an evaluation.) But the concern is\ndifferently motivated: where Velleman is trying to halt a regress in\nthe structural analysis of agency, Buss is trying to express the\nphilosophical thought that action is active rather than passive. Once\npast the conclusion that a theory of practical rationality had better\nnot presuppose a Humean theory of motivation, Buss is open-minded both\nabout what one\u2019s practical reasons might turn out to be like, and thus\nabout the consequences for moral theory. And worries about\npsychologism do not seem to figure into her view.\n\nTurning now to Brewer, we encounter a shift of key.  In the contrasts\nbetween full-fledged and lower-grade doings that we have reviewed so\nfar, \u201caction \u201d was used to designate the first-class\nversion, and often \u201cactivity \u201d labeled its lesser\nrelative.  In Brewer\u2019s terminology,\ndialectical activity is the privileged category, and actions\nmake up the inferior contrasting class.  Actions are merely structured\nto produce a \u201cpre-envisioned state of affairs\u201d.  But\ndialectical activity is marked out by two features.  First, coming to\nunderstand better what the activity is counts as an essential aspect\nof the activity itself.  And second, continually arriving at a deeper\nunderstanding of the good of the activity also is an essential aspect\nof such an activity (Brewer 2009, 55 and passim).  For\ninstance, one might well think that part of what it is to be in a\nhealthy and satisfactory friendship is to be developing a\nprogressively deeper sense of what this particular friendship is\nabout, of why and how it is rewarding, and of what challenges it poses\nand how to navigate them.  Moreover, it is also to be developing a\ngradually improving understanding of the demands, rewards, promise and\nsignificance of friendship generally.  (The view is positioned as\nrecovering insights from older ethics, with pride of place to\nAristotle, but as before, here we will not take up the historical\nquestion.) \n\nAs we will shortly see, the anchor for the view is not that of our\npreviously surveyed positions, that to do is thereby to act, period.\n(And so Brewer\u2019s view is perhaps a penumbral member of this family of\npositions.)  Rather, firstly, mere actions typically will not make\nsense outside the context of a dialectical activity, and secondly,\nBrewer advances but does not quite directly argue for the suggestion\nthat dialectical activities make up everything that could count as\nintrinsically valuable for human beings.  Anything that is worthwhile\non its own \u2013 anyway, worthwhile enough to be taken seriously as\nsomething one would try to fold into one\u2019s life, from\nconversation to friendship to philosophy \u2013 belongs in this\ncategory.\n\n\nBecause the proposal is likely to bring to mind specificationist\nclaims about practical reasoning, some compare and contrast is in\norder.  Specificationism is built around the observation that,\nfrequently enough, one\u2019s ends are not concrete or definite\nenough to launch questions about how to attain them; first, the\ncontent of one\u2019s goals must be filled in and firmed up enough\nfor that to be possible.  For instance, and borrowing a low-key\nexample from Bernard Williams (1981a, 104), if our objective is to be\nentertained this evening, and so far that\u2019s all we have settled,\nwe have to decide what sort of entertainment it will be, before we can\nconsider steps we might take.  Therefore, there must be a mode of\npractical thinking that does that job.  (For an overview of the\nspecificationist back and forth, see Millgram, 2008.)  But where the\naim of specificationist deliberation is to arrive at a sufficiently\nconcrete rendering of an objective, at which point it ceases, and\ncalculatively structured action, more or less as we saw it rendered by\nVogler, resumes, in dialectical activity, the clarification of the\nactivity and of how it is desirable is ongoing, rather than a\npreliminary.  You find out what the rewards of this friendship are by\nparticipating in it, and the longer you are someone\u2019s friend,\nthe more nuanced and the deeper your appreciation of what it brings to\nyour life becomes.  When it\u2019s just an evening\u2019s\nentertainment, figuring out what we want it to be doesn\u2019t\nusually turn up as part of entertaining ourselves; in the activities\nthat constitute friendship, however, it is grounds for complaint when\none of the participants ceases paying attention to the emerging shape\nof the friendship itself.  The deliberative baton is not simply handed\nover to means-end reasoning; rather, although one is moved to one\nafter another after another goal-directed action, those actions are\nthemselves part and parcel of further comprehending just what the\ndialectical activity in which they arise is.\n\nAdapting one of Brewer\u2019s illustrations, two friends may be on a\nmotorcycle on their way to Vegas, for blackjack and wild times; when\nwe check back, a few years later, we find them in the gardening aisle\nat Home Depot; a few years after that, doing something very different\nfrom either of those things.  There\u2019s an observation we can\nextract, about the relation between activities and actions as other\nviews we have surveyed conceive them: on the one hand, the activity of\nfriendship produces an endless stream of subsidiary goals and actions\n(those roadtrips, gardening projects and so on); on the other, because\nthe participants\u2019 conception of the friendship will continue to\ndeepen and shift, the actions in that stream cannot be concretely\ncharacterized up front.  The versions of high-grade and low-grade\naction being contrasted with each other here are interdependent.\nDialectical activity normally emits merely end-directed action on an\nongoing basis.  (And the intelligibility of those ends normally\ndepends on their embedding within dialectical activity, if only the\nactivity of living one\u2019s life; it makes sense that they\u2019d\nbe biking to Vegas, given how, at that stage of the friendship, they\nunderstand what their friendship is about, and without that context,\nit wouldn\u2019t make much sense.)  Conversely, the improving grasp\nof what one is doing, central to the activity, depends on the friction\nwith the surrounding circumstances produced by the end-directed\nactions; it was, perhaps, the way the Vegas trip didn\u2019t work\nout, and the subsequent quarrel, that made the two of them rethink\nwhat they were doing with each other, and start in on the\ngardening.\n\nOn the views against which Brewer is positioning his own, actions are\nmotivated by desires, which are propositional attitudes: that is,\ncentrally, descriptions of states of affairs that might be realized in\nthe future, and in light of which you effect and adjust what you can\nand are willing to, so as to make the description true.  (Brewer\nattempts to reappropriate the concept of desire for his own purposes,\nbut I won\u2019t spell that move out here.)  However, what you\nare moved \u2013 as opposed to \u2018motivated\u2019\n\u2013 by, in the course of a dialectical activity, cannot be\ncaptured by a proposition.  For one thing, a proposition has a\ndefinite, stable content; propositions are sometimes thought of as\npartitioning all the possible worlds \u2013 the ways things might be\nor might have been \u2013 into those that are, intuitively,\ncompatible with it, and those that are not; the proposition effects\nits partition once and for all.  But the content of what\nmoves you, in the course of dialectical activity, is deepening and\nevolving, and there is no point at which apprehending it is properly\nover.  So no proposition could successfully demarcate what it is the\nactivity is after and about.\n\nMoreover, desires as nowadays standardly conceived set a proposition\nas to be made true at some point in the future.  But the object of\ndialectical activity does not lie in the future: living your life is a\ndialectical activity, and you are already living; your life\ndoes not wait to be lived until it is over.  If you are\nsomebody\u2019s friend, you are already participating, you\nhope successfully, in the friendship.  If you are philosophizing in an\nappropriately philosophical frame of mind (and so, always striving\nbetter to understand what philosophy is), you are\nalready philosophizing.  So although the many simpler\nsubsidiary actions that are constantly being spun off by dialectical\nactivities can often be thought of as controlled by this sort of\npropositional attitude, dialectical activity cannot itself be\nconstrued as desire-driven, in this standard sense of\n\u2018desire\u2019.\n\nWhat is at stake in the disagreement over how to conceptualize these\nongoing courses of action?  In the example we\u2019re using, the\nfriends\u2019 goals change dramatically from time to time; seen\nthrough the lens of rationalization-by-desires, as standardly\nconceived, the segments of the friendship are only collected into a\ndeveloping trajectory retrospectively.  The cost is not just that one\nmisses seeing what unifies the activity while it is in progress; often\nenough, the inability to understand the activity as unified, despite\nthe very different appearances of its segments, undercuts its unity.\n(Not always: Brewer adduces Augustine as an example of someone who did\nnot understand his life as a search for God until late on, even though\nthat is what it was and had been all along.)  But then, one does not\nhave that dialectical activity \u2013 here, a friendship,\nwhose parties are jointly pressing towards a more truthful, more\nworkable, or otherwise better understanding of what that friendship\nis.  That means that operating only on the basis of\nrationalization-by-desires condemns one to life largely empty of the\ngoods that really matter \u2013 for instance, friendships.  To be\nsure, whether this is the cost of surrendering dialectical activities\nas Brewer describes them will depend on whether he is substantively\ncharacterizing those central human goods correctly; an opponent will\npresumably contest the view on those grounds.\n\nReturning to the point of convergence with older specificationism, if\nthe evolving conception of a dialectical activity and what makes it\ndesirable is deliberative rather than arational, there must be\nreasons, and reasoning, that can modify not only one\u2019s decisions\nabout how to attain what one already straightforwardly wants, but also\none\u2019s view of what one is after.  That is, in the jargon, over\nand above instrumental rationality, deliberation of ends must be\npossible.  And that returns us to the question of the conception of\nreasons tied to this contrast between dialectical activity and mere\nactions.  Per the spirit of Brewer\u2019s view, it shouldn\u2019t be\npossible simply to spell out what practical reasoning correctly\nperformed must amount to; since practical reasoning is an aspect of\nmost or all dialectical activity, our grasp of what practical\nreasoning is will continue to develop alongside our grasp of such\nactivities.  Nonetheless, a number of upshots for practical\nrationality stand out in Brewer\u2019s discussion.\n\nFirst, against the often implicitly accepted model of practical\nreasoning as a matter of first surveying surrounding circumstances,\nthen assessing them, and then deciding what new action to initiate\nnext, one largely attends to what one is already in the middle of\ndoing, clarifying how it has gone hitherto, with an eye to a\ncontinuation.  The action does not commence only after the survey and\nassessment, and consequently the primary object of attention turns out\nto be the action already in progress.  Here the model is an author\nrereading his half-written book or paper, wondering how to complete\nhis not-fully-formed train of thought \u2013 the train of thought he\nis in the middle of, rather than about to kick off \u2013 or perhaps\nthat author reviewing his rough drafts.  Because understanding of what\none is doing does not come all at once but gradually, as one proceeds\nwith one\u2019s course of action, the ability to survey and assess\nall the considerations relevant to a decision up front, as presupposed\nby the competing model, will not normally be in place when anything\nthat is itself significant is at stake.\n\nSecond, the question one finds oneself asking amounts to,\n\u2018What have I been doing?,\u2019 and those\ncharacterizations of what one is doing that drive further choice will\nbe largely framed using thick ethical concepts.  That is, rather than\napplying concepts like \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019 to\nevaluatively neutral descriptions of one\u2019s circumstances or\nactivity, they will deploy descriptions whose very application depends\non mobilizing one\u2019s evaluative capacities.  (E.g., in the\nelaborate case study which led Bernard Williams to identify this class\nof concepts, there isn\u2019t any way to mark out what counts as\nobscene, if one occupies only the evaluatively neutral view of a\nMartian exobiologist; Williams 1981b, and for background, see the\nentry on\nthick ethical concepts.)\nWilliams controversially claimed that thick ethical concepts could not\nbe factored into strictly factual and strictly evaluative components\n(for an overview, see Millgram 1995).  Brewer argues that the unity\nover time of dialectical activities supports Williams\u2019s view on\nthis point, and in addition, that our need to rely on thick ethical\nconcepts undercuts the distinction we have used in framing this very\nsurvey, between theoretical and practical reasons \u2013 that is,\nrespectively, reasons that figure into argument as to how the facts\nstand, and those that figure into arguments for doing one thing or\nanother.\n\nAnd third and finally for now, certain of our qualms about delegating\nour practical reasoning to others are accounted for. If practical\nthought is, as Brewer puts it, \u2018a seamless part of the\nactivity\u2019 of, say, friendship, or conducting a conversation, or\nmaking one\u2019s way through philosophy, or just living one\u2019s\nlife, then to contract out one\u2019s deliberation and decisions to\nthird parties \u2013 even expert third parties \u2013 is to forego\nthe valuable activity itself.\n\nAlthough both Buss and Brewer highlight the role of evaluation in\naction, for Buss, the evaluation that matters is the settled output of\none\u2019s evaluating; for Brewer, the evaluation that matters is the\nevaluating.\n",
