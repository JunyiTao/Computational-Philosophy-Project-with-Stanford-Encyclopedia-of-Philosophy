    "main_text": "Basic Principles || The Three Marks of Existence\n2.1 The Three Marks of Existence\n\n\nThe general leitmotif of Buddhist teachings, which is also the first \nof the four noble truths, is the realization that unsatisfactoriness \nor suffering (Skt. du\u1e25kha, P\u0101li dukkha) \nis a pervasive aspect of conditioned existence. With the recognition \nof this fundamental truth about the nature of phenomena comes the \nrealization of the cause of discontent and of its finality (the \nsecond and third noble truths, respectively). Lastly, undertaking the\ncourse of action that leads to its cessation (the fourth noble truth)\nforms the basis and the main motivating principle of the Buddhist \npath. \n\n\n1. Unsatisfactoriness (du\u1e25kha). As the first mark of \nconditioned existence, unsatisfactoriness presents both an \nopportunity and a challenge: as an undesirable condition, \nunsatisfactoriness itself is a motivator for its own overcoming. But \nwithout a proper understanding of its root cause, unsatisfactoriness \ncan become a source of aversion (toward unpleasant states) and of \ngrasping (after pleasant states). The cause of this \nunsatisfactoriness is ignorance (avidy\u0101), understood \nnot simply as lacking knowledge about particular states of affairs, \nbut rather as a basic misunderstanding about how things truly are. \nThe Buddhist Abhidharma traditions break this unsatisfactoriness into\nthree categories: \n\nunsatisfactoriness proper\n(du\u1e25kha-du\u1e25khat\u0101), which comprises such\ncommon discomforts as aches and pains as well as mental states such as\nsadness and unhappiness; \nthe unsatisfactoriness of compounded phenomena due to their\nimpermanent nature (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra-du\u1e25khat\u0101),\nwhich explains why even apparently pleasant and desirable states are\nultimately a source of discontent on account of their conditioned and\nimpermanent nature;\nthe unsatisfactoriness inherent in change\n(vipari\u1e47\u0101ma-du\u1e25khat\u0101), which captures\nthe sense of distress that follows the realization that pleasant\nsensations and mental states of delight change as the objects upon\nwhich they depend change (see also Sa\u1e43yutta\nNik\u0101ya, IV, 259).\n\n\n\n2. Impermanence (anitya). As the second mark of existence,\nimpermanence pervades all compounded phenomena. It forms an integral\npart of the theory of momentariness\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ikav\u0101da), which asserts that phenomena\ndo not endure for more than a moment. In the Shorter Discourse to\nSaccaka (Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, I, 230, 35), the Buddha\nexplains that all formations (feeling, perception, etc.) and in effect\nall things are to be regarded as impermanent. \n\n\n3. Not-self (an\u0101tman). This Buddhist view of the \nimpermanence of all phenomena works against the natural tendency to \nassume that knowledge and experience are attributable to a self that \nis permanent, stable, and unchanging. Instead of reifying each moment\nof existence, and operating with the assumption that continuity is \nthe hallmark of our lives, the Buddhist view presents a fluid account\nof experience as an ever-changing stream of psycho-physical events. \nThis dynamic model of human existence comprises the five classes \nof phenomena the Buddha referred to as the \u201caggregates of \ngrasping\u201d (up\u0101d\u0101na-skandha), on account of \nour tendency to grasp after and identify with them (see \n \u00a72.3).\n These classes of phenomena are to be understood purely in causal \nterms, and not as the attributes and activities of a substantive \nself. There is no self or substantive mind that either supervenes on or \nexists apart from these aggregates. Rather, as the term \n\u2018aggregate\u2019 suggests, the Buddhist tradition introduces a\nnew and unique way of talking about human experience by avoiding the \nmetaphysical pitfalls of reification.\n",
