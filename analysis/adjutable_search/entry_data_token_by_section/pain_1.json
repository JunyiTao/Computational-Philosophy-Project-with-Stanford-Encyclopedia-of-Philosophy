    "main_text": "The common-sense conception of pain || First thread: pain as something in a body part\n1.1 First thread: pain as something in a body part\n\nThe first thread treats pains as particulars spatially located in body\nregions, or more generally, as particular conditions of body parts\nthat have spatiotemporal characteristics as well as features such as\nintensity (among others). This thread manifests itself in common ways\nof attributing pains to bodily locations, such as the following:\n\n\n(1) I have a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n(2) There is a throbbing pain in my left thigh.\n(3) My right shoulder hurts.\n(4) My wisdom tooth aches.\n\n\n\nAccording to this thread, pains are like physical objects or specific\nconditions of physical objects. We also commonly use the verbs\n\u2018feel\u2019 or \u2018experience\u2019 to describe our\nepistemic relation to pains attributed to body parts:\n\n\n(5) I feel a sharp pain in the back of my right hand.\n(6) I am experiencing pain in my upper left thigh, etc.\n\n\n\n(5) suggests that we stand in some sort of perceptual relation to a\nspatiotemporal particular. Without an indefinite article, (6) suggests\nthat I perceive some quantifiable feature or condition of my thigh.\nWhen we feel pains in bodily locations, our attention and nursing\nbehavior are directed toward those locations.\n\nLess frequently, we also talk about the same pain returning or lasting\nintermittently:\n\n\n(7) I have been having the same pain in my knee whenever\nI start jogging.\n(8) My headache returned the moment we started having the\nsame argument again.\n\n\n\nSo according to this thread when we feel pain in parts of our bodies,\nwe perceive something or some condition in those parts.\u00a0 When we\nreport them by uttering sentences like (1) through (8), we seem to\nmake perceptual reports. These reports seem on a par with\nmore straightforward perceptual reports such as:\n\n\n(9) I see a dark discoloration on the back of my right hand.\n(10) I see the red apple on the table.\n(11) I heard a big explosion.\n(12) I am smelling the sweet odor coming from the rose\ngarden.\n(13) I feel the smooth texture of the surface, etc.\n\n\n\nCompare, for instance, (5) and (9): they seem to have the same surface\ngrammar demanding a similar perceptual reading according to which I\nstand in some sort of perceptual relation to something.\n\nThus, this thread in our ordinary conception favors an understanding\nof pains as if they were the objects of our perceptions. When\nthis is combined with our standard practice of treating pains as\nhaving spatiotemporal properties along with other similar features\ntypically attributed to physical objects or quantities, it points to\nan understanding of pains according to which pains might plausibly be\nidentified with physical features or conditions of our body parts,\nprobably with some sort of (actual or impending) physical damage or\ntrauma to the tissue. Indeed, when we look at the ways in which we\ntalk about a pain, we seem to be attributing something bad to a bodily\nlocation by reporting its somatosensory perception there, just as we\nreport the existence of a rotten apple on the table by reporting its\nvisual perception.\n\nNevertheless, the very same common sense, although it points in that\ndirection, resists identifying a pain with any physical\nfeature or condition instantiated in the body. Thus it also seems\nto resist identifying feeling pain in body regions with\nperceiving something physical in those regions.\n\nA quick thought experiment should confirm this. Suppose that we do in\nfact attribute a physical condition, call it PC,\nwhen we attribute pain to body parts, and that PC is the\nperceptual object of such experiences. So, for instance, John\u2019s\ncurrent excruciating experience (call this E) is caused by\nand represents a physical condition in his right thigh and our\nordinary concept of pain applies in the first instance to this\ncondition in his thigh. From this it would follow that\n\n\n(a) John would not have any pain if he had E, but no\nPC in his thigh\n\n(as in the case of, for instance, phantom limb pains and centrally\ngenerated chronic pains such as sciatica),\n\n\nand, conversely,\n\n\n(b) John would have pain if he had PC but no E\n\n(as would be the case, for instance, if he had taken absolutely\neffective painkillers or his thigh had been anesthetized).\n\n\nBut these statements are intuitively incorrect. They appear to clash\nwith our ordinary or dominant concept of pain, which seems to track\nthe feeling of pain (experience) rather than the physical condition.\nThis resistance to identifying pains with localizable physical\nconditions comes from the second thread found in the very same\ncommon-sense conception of pain.\n",
