    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nHannah Arendt, one of the leading political thinkers of the twentieth\ncentury, was born in 1906 in Hanover and died in New York in 1975. In\n1924, after having completed her high school studies, she went to\nMarburg University to study with Martin Heidegger. The encounter with\nHeidegger, with whom she had a brief but intense love-affair, had a\nlasting influence on her thought. After a year of study in Marburg,\nshe moved to Freiburg University where she spent one semester\nattending the lectures of Edmund Husserl. In the spring of 1926 she\nwent to Heidelberg University to study with Karl Jaspers, a\nphilosopher with whom she established a long-lasting intellectual and\npersonal friendship. She completed her doctoral dissertation, entitled\nDer Liebesbegriff bei Augustin (hereafter LA) under Jaspers\u2019s\nsupervision in 1929. She was forced to flee Germany in 1933 as a\nresult of Hitler\u2019s rise to power, and after a brief stay in Prague and\nGeneva she moved to Paris where for six years (1933\u201339) she worked for\na number of Jewish refugee organisations. In 1936 she separated from\nher first husband, G\u00fcnther Stern, and started to live with\nHeinrich Bl\u00fccher, whom she married in 1940. During her stay in\nParis she continued to work on her biography of Rahel\nVarnhagen, which was not published until 1957 (hereafter RV). In\n1941 she was forced to leave France and moved to New York with her\nhusband and mother. In New York she soon became part of an influential\ncircle of writers and intellectuals gathered around the journal\nPartisan Review. During the post-war period she lectured at a\nnumber of American universities, including Princeton, Berkeley and\nChicago, but was most closely associated with the New School for\nSocial Research, where she was a professor of political philosophy\nuntil her death in 1975. In 1951 she published The Origins of\nTotalitarianism (hereafter OT), a major study of the Nazi and\nStalinist regimes that soon became a classic, followed by The\nHuman Condition in 1958 (hereafter HC), her most important\nphilosophical work. In 1961 she attended the trial of Adolf Eichmann\nin Jerusalem as a reporter for The New Yorker magazine, and\ntwo years later published Eichmann in Jerusalem (hereafter\nEJ), which caused a deep controversy in Jewish circles. The same year\nsaw the publication of On Revolution (hereafter OR), a\ncomparative analysis of the American and French revolutions. A number\nof important essays were also published during the 1960s and early\n1970s: a first collection was entitled Between Past and Future\n(hereafter BPF), a second Men in Dark Times (hereafter MDT),\nand a third Crises of the Republic (hereafter CR). At the\ntime of her death in 1975, she had completed the first two volumes on\nThinking and Willing of her last major philosophical\nwork, The Life of the Mind, which was published posthumously\nin 1978 (hereafter LM). The third volume, on Judging, was\nleft unfinished, but some background material and lecture notes were\npublished in 1982 under the title Lectures on Kant\u2019s Political\nPhilosophy (hereafter LKPP).\n",
