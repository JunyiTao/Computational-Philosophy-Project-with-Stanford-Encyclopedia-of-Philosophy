    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue Theory\n4.2 Virtue Theory\n\nAstell can be read as working within the virtue theory tradition,\nwhich focuses on the character of the moral agent, for she writes\nabout themes like virtue, moral education, moral judgment, character,\nfriendship, and the role of passions in moral action. However, it can\nbe argued that Astell should be considered a virtue\n\u201ctheorist\u201d\u2014and not be considered a virtue\n\u201cethicist\u201d\u2014because she does not hold the tenet that\ngoodness is metaphysically prior to rightness. (See Broad 2016 for a\nreading along these lines.)\n\nWhen discussing the passions, Astell draws on Descartes, explaining\nthat passions arise out of the mind-body union. Like Descartes, she\nholds that we will always have passions, for we are embodied souls.\nGiven that we will always have passions, it is a good practice to\nlearn how to properly direct them and even remedy them, if needed.\nThis task involves properly aligning passions correctly with reason\nsuch that they develop into virtues.\n\nAstell develops her account of the passions by arguing that specific\npassions are not naturally connected with men versus women. That is,\nwomen and men do not necessarily have virtues or vices that align with\n(what we today call) the gender of their bodies. Rather,\nanyone\u2014despite their gender\u2014can have any passion, virtue,\nor vice. This means that even men can develop the so-called\n\u201cfeminine vices.\u201d This point is important to Astell\nbecause of (what can be called) the Women\u2019s Defective Nature\nPrejudice, described above (in section 3), according to which\nAstell\u2019s \u201cLadies\u201d are seen as naturally having\n\u201cfeminine vices\u201d such as imprudence, vanity, and pride.\nAstell shows that such vices are not natural or inherent features of\nthe souls of women. (See Sowaal 2007 and 2016 for a reading along\nthese lines.)\n\nThe passion that is central to Astell\u2019s theory is love. Her\naccount of love draws on neo-Platonic Christian ethics and traditions\nof monasticism (especially practices of communal contemplation,\nmeditation, simplification, and prayer). According to Astell, humans\nhave both an ability and duty to love. Section 1.3 above discussed the\nmetaphysical implications Astell draws from this; here and in the next\nsection, we turn to the ethical and religious implications.\n\nFor Christian philosophers, Astell included, the love of God is\ncentral to theological ethics, for it is one of the two lessons that\nJesus emphasized from his Jewish education and commanded of his\nfollowers: love God and love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:\n36\u201340). Thus the philosopher can ask: what makes it possible for\nus to discharge these duties? That is, how is the world made such that\nwe can love God and love each other? As mentioned above,\nAstell addresses these issues by describing two kinds of\nlove\u2014that of desire and benevolence. We can now say a bit more\nabout her view: for Astell, the human ability to desire\nGod\u2014that is, to stand before God and ask that God complete the\nhuman self\u2014allows for the possibility for humans to offer\nbenevolence to each other\u2014that is, to truly wish each\nother well. These are the grounds for Astell\u2019s account of\nfriendship, which is a theory that allows for universal friendship\nthat does not require either partiality or reciprocity (unlike what is\nrequired for Aristotelian friendship). In writing about friendship,\nAstell is especially interested in giving an account of how women can\nbe \u201cspiritual\u201d friends with each other. Thus she examines\nsame-sex friendship, and she considers women\u2019s social bonds as\nthey exist outside of the family unit. (See Kendrick 2018 for a\nreading along these lines.)\n",
