Similarly, amplification devices are used to\nhear faint sounds. But if to observe something is to perceive it, not\nevery use of instruments to augment the senses qualifies as\nobservational.\n\nPhilosophers generally agree that you can observe the moons of Jupiter\nwith a telescope, or a heartbeat with a stethoscope. The van Fraassen\nof The Scientific Image is a notable exception, for whom to\nbe \u2018observable\u2019 meant to be something that, were it\npresent to a creature like us, would be observed. Thus, for van\nFraassen, the moons of Jupiter are observable \u201csince astronauts\nwill no doubt be able to see them as well from close up\u201d (1980,\n16). In contrast, microscopic entities are not observable on van\nFraassen\u2019s account because creatures like us cannot\nstrategically maneuver ourselves to see them, present before us, with\nour unaided senses.\n\nMany philosophers have criticized van Fraassen\u2019s view as overly\nrestrictive. Nevertheless, philosophers differ in their willingness to\ndraw the line between what counts as observable and what does not\nalong the spectrum of increasingly complicated instrumentation. Many\nphilosophers who don\u2019t mind telescopes and microscopes still\nfind it unnatural to say that high energy physicists\n\u2018observe\u2019 particles or particle interactions when they\nlook at bubble chamber photographs\u2014let alone digital\nvisualizations of energy depositions left in calorimeters that are not\nthemselves inspected. Their intuitions come from the plausible\nassumption that one can observe only what one can see by looking, hear\nby listening, feel by touching, and so on. Investigators can neither\nlook at (direct their gazes toward and attend to) nor visually\nexperience charged particles moving through a detector. Instead they\ncan look at and see tracks in the chamber, in bubble chamber\nphotographs, calorimeter data visualizations, etc.\n\nIn more contentious examples, some philosophers have moved to speaking\nof instrument-augmented empirical research as more like tool use than\nsensing. Hacking (1981) argues that we do not see through a\nmicroscope, but rather with it. Daston and Galison (2007)\nhighlight the inherent interactivity of a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope, in which scientists image and manipulate atoms by\nexchanging electrons between the sharp tip of the microscope and the\nsurface to be imaged (397). Others have opted to stretch the meaning\nof observation to accommodate what we might otherwise be tempted to\ncall instrument-aided detections. For instance, Shapere (1982) argues\nthat while it may initially strike philosophers as counter-intuitive,\nit makes perfect sense to call the detection of neutrinos from the\ninterior of the sun \u201cdirect observation.\u201d\n\nThe variety of views on the observable/unobservable distinction hint\nthat empiricists may have been barking up the wrong philosophical\ntree. Many of the things scientists investigate do not interact with\nhuman perceptual systems as required to produce perceptual experiences\nof them. The methods investigators use to study such things argue\nagainst the idea\u2014however plausible it may once have\nseemed\u2014that scientists do or should rely exclusively on their\nperceptual systems to obtain the evidence they need. Thus Feyerabend\nproposed as a thought experiment that if measuring equipment was\nrigged up to register the magnitude of a quantity of interest, a\ntheory could be tested just as well against its outputs as against\nrecords of human perceptions (Feyerabend 1969, 132\u2013137).\nFeyerabend could have made his point with historical examples instead\nof thought experiments. A century earlier Helmholtz estimated the\nspeed of excitatory impulses traveling through a motor nerve. To\ninitiate impulses whose speed could be estimated, he implanted an\nelectrode into one end of a nerve fiber and ran a current into it from\na coil. The other end was attached to a bit of muscle whose\ncontraction signaled the arrival of the impulse. To find out how long\nit took the impulse to reach the muscle he had to know when the\nstimulating current reached the nerve. But\n\n[o]ur senses are not capable of directly perceiving an individual\nmoment of time with such small duration \u2026\n\n\nand so Helmholtz had to resort to what he called \u2018artificial\nmethods of observation\u2019 (Olesko and Holmes 1994, 84). This meant\narranging things so that current from the coil could deflect a\ngalvanometer needle. Assuming that the magnitude of the deflection is\nproportional to the duration of current passing from the coil,\nHelmholtz could use the deflection to estimate the duration he could\nnot see (ibid). This sense of \u2018artificial observation\u2019 is\nnot to be confused e.g., with using magnifying glasses or telescopes\nto see tiny or distant objects. Such devices enable the observer to\nscrutinize visible objects. The minuscule duration of the current flow\nis not a visible object. Helmholtz studied it by cleverly concocting\ncircumstances so that the deflection of the needle would meaningfully\nconvey the information he needed. Hooke (1705,\n16\u201317) argued for and designed instruments to\nexecute the same kind of strategy in the 17th century.\n\nIt is of interest that records of perceptual observation are not\nalways epistemically superior to data collected via experimental\nequipment. Indeed, it is not unusual for investigators to use\nnon-perceptual evidence to evaluate perceptual data and correct for\nits errors. For example, Rutherford and Pettersson conducted similar\nexperiments to find out if certain elements disintegrated to emit\ncharged particles under radioactive bombardment. To detect emissions,\nobservers watched a scintillation screen for faint flashes produced by\nparticle strikes. Pettersson\u2019s assistants reported seeing\nflashes from silicon and certain other elements. Rutherford\u2019s\ndid not. Rutherford\u2019s colleague, James Chadwick, visited\nPettersson\u2019s laboratory to evaluate his data. Instead of watching\nthe screen and checking Pettersson\u2019s data against what he saw,\nChadwick arranged to have Pettersson\u2019s assistants watch the\nscreen while unbeknownst to them he manipulated the equipment,\nalternating normal operating conditions with a condition in which\nparticles, if any, could not hit the screen. Pettersson\u2019s data\nwere discredited by the fact that his assistants reported flashes at\nclose to the same rate in both conditions (Stuewer 1985,\n284\u2013288).\n\nWhen the process of producing data is relatively convoluted, it is\neven easier to see that human sense perception is not the ultimate\nepistemic engine. Consider functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI)\nof the brain decorated with colors to indicate magnitudes of\nelectrical activity in different regions during the performance of a\ncognitive task. To produce these images, brief magnetic pulses are\napplied to the subject\u2019s brain. The magnetic force coordinates\nthe precessions of protons in hemoglobin and other bodily stuffs to\nmake them emit radio signals strong enough for the equipment to\nrespond to. When the magnetic force is relaxed, the signals from\nprotons in highly oxygenated hemoglobin deteriorate at a detectably\ndifferent rate than signals from blood that carries less oxygen.\nElaborate algorithms are applied to radio signal records to estimate\nblood oxygen levels at the places from which the signals are\ncalculated to have originated. There is good reason to believe that\nblood flowing just downstream from spiking neurons carries appreciably\nmore oxygen than blood in the vicinity of resting neurons. Assumptions\nabout the relevant spatial and temporal relations are used to estimate\nlevels of electrical activity in small regions of the brain\ncorresponding to pixels in the finished image. The results of all of\nthese computations are used to assign the appropriate colors to pixels\nin a computer generated image of the brain. In view of all of this,\nfunctional brain imaging differs, e.g., from looking and seeing,\nphotographing, and measuring with a thermometer or a galvanometer in\nways that make it uninformative to call it observation. And similarly\nfor many other methods scientists use to produce non-perceptual\nevidence.\n\nThe role of the senses in fMRI data production is limited to such\nthings as monitoring the equipment and keeping an eye on the subject.\nTheir epistemic role is limited to discriminating the colors in the\nfinished image, reading tables of numbers the computer used to assign\nthem, and so on. While it is true that researchers typically use their\nsense of sight to take in visualizations of processed fMRI\ndata\u2014or numbers on a page or screen for that\nmatter\u2014this is not the primary locus of epistemic\naction. Researchers learn about brain processes through fMRI data, to\nthe extent that they do, primarily in virtue of the suitability of the\ncausal connection between the target processes and the data records,\nand of the transformations those data undergo when they are processed\ninto the maps or other results that scientists want to use. The\ninteresting questions are not about observability, i.e. whether\nneuronal activity, blood oxygen levels, proton precessions, radio\nsignals, and so on, are properly understood as observable by creatures\nlike us. The epistemic significance of the fMRI data depends on their\ndelivering us the right sort of access to the target, but observation\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for that\naccess.\n\nFollowing Shapere (1982), one could respond by adopting an extremely\npermissive view of what counts as an \u2018observation\u2019 so as\nto allow even highly processed data to count as observations. However,\nit is hard to reconcile the idea that highly processed data like fMRI\nimages record observations with the traditional empiricist notion that\ncalculations involving theoretical assumptions and background beliefs\nmust not be allowed (on pain of loss of objectivity) to intrude into\nthe process of data production. Observation garnered its special\nepistemic status in the first place because it seemed more direct,\nmore immediate, and therefore less distorted and muddled than (say)\ndetection or inference. The production of fMRI images requires\nextensive statistical manipulation based on theories about the radio\nsignals, and a variety of factors having to do with their detection\nalong with beliefs about relations between blood oxygen levels and\nneuronal activity, sources of systematic error, and more. Insofar as\nthe use of the term \u2018observation\u2019 connotes this extra\nbaggage of traditional empiricism, it may be better to replace\nobservation-talk with terminology that is more obviously permissive,\nsuch as that of \u2018empirical data\u2019 and \u2018empirical\nresults.\u2019\n",
