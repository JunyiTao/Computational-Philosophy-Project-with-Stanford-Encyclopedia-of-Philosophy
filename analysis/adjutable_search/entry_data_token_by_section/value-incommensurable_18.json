    "main_text": "Deliberation and Choice || Risky Actions\n4.7 Risky Actions\n\nCaspar Hare (2010) introduces and discusses a problem relating to how\nrational choice theory can encompass risky actions involving outcomes\nthat are on a par. If we assume that two outcomes, A and\nB, are on a par, it follows that a small improvement, or mild\nsweetening as Hare phrases it, to one of the outcomes would not break\nthe parity relation. We can imagine two actions, X and\nY. If we opt for X then we will either end up with a\nsweetened A in state 1 or a sweetened B in state 2, and\nthe outcomes are equiprobable. If we opt for Y, we will end up\nwith B in state 1 or A in state 2, and the outcomes are\nequiprobable. On the one hand, it seems as if we ought to opt for\nX since we will end up with a sweetened alternative, A+\nor B+. On the other hand, it is difficult to say why X\nis better than Y. The outcome in state 1 is not better if we do\nX rather than Y since the outcomes, A+ and\nB, are on a par, and the outcome in state 2 is not better if we\ndo Y rather than X since the outcomes, B+ and\nA, are on a par. The problem can be construed as a lottery\nwhere one lottery is deemed comparable with another, yet their outcomes\nare incomparable (see Rabinowicz, 2021b, for this axiological\nformulation of Hare\u2019s problem). Hare argues that we should\n\u201ctake the sugar\u201d, i.e., we ought to opt for X (see also\nBader 2019). Inspired by a Fitting-Attitudes Analysis of value Wlodek\nRabinowicz argues that even though outcomes may be on a par, it is\npossible for an action to be better than another (2021b). Others such\nas Schoenfield (2014), Bales, Cohen & Handfield (2014), and Doody\n(2019) reach the opposite conclusion.\n",
