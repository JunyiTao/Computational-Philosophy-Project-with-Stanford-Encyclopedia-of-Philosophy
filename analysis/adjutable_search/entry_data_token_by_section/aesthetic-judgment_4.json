    "main_text": "The Judgment of Taste || Normativity and Pleasure\n1.4 Normativity and Pleasure\n\nAs described, normativity attaches to judgments of taste\nthemselves. What does this imply for pleasure in beauty?\nSince judgments of taste are based on responses of pleasure, it would\nmake little sense if our judgments were more or less appropriate but\nour responses were not. The normative claim of our judgments of taste\nmust derive from the fact that we think that some responses\nare better or more appropriate to their object than others. Responses\nonly license judgments which can be more or less appropriate because\nresponses themselves can be more or less appropriate. If I get\npleasure from drinking Canary-wine and you do not, neither of us will\nthink of the other as being mistaken. But if you don\u2019t\nget pleasure from Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets, I will think\nof you as being in error\u2014not just your judgment, but\nyour liking. I think that I am right to have my\nresponse, and that your response is\ndefective. Someone who thinks that there is, in Hume\u2019s\nwords, \u201can equality of genius\u201d between some inferior\ncomposer, on the one hand, and J. S. Bach, on the other, has a\ndefective sensibility (Hume 1757 [1985: 230]). Roger Scruton\nputs the point well when he says:\n\n\nWhen we study [the Einstein Tower and the Giotto campanile] \u2026\nour attitude is not simply one of curiosity, accompanied by some\nindefinable pleasure or satisfaction. Inwardly, we affirm our\npreference as valid\u2026. (Scruton 1979: 105) \n\n\nThis is the reason why we demand the same feeling from\nothers, even if we do not expect it. We think that our response is\nmore appropriate to its object than its opposite. And, in turn, this\nis why we think that our judgment about that object\nis more correct than its opposite. The normativity of judgment derives\nfrom the normativity of feeling.\n\nBut how can some feelings be better or worse than others? To\nanswer this question, we need to ask: how far does the normativity of\njudgments of taste inhere in the feeling itself? The realist about\nbeauty will say that the feeling has normativity built into it in\nvirtue of its representational content; the feelings themselves can be\nmore or less veridical. Pleasure in beauty, for example, has as its\nobject the property of beauty; we find the beauty\npleasurable. A Humean sentimentalist will probably say that\nnormativity is something we somehow construct or foist upon our\npleasures and displeasures, which have no such content. And Kant has\nhis own account, which appeals to cognitive states that are not\nbeliefs. The issue is controversial. However, what we can say for sure\nis that it is definitive of pleasure in beauty that it licenses\njudgments that make claim to correctness. Beyond this, there will be\ntheoretical divergence.\n\nThis normativity is definitive of the judgment of taste, and is its\nsecond defining characteristic, which we should add to the fact that\nit is based on subjective grounds of pleasure or displeasure.\n",
