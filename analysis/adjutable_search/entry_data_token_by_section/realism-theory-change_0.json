    "main_text": "The History of the Historical Challenge || The Bankruptcy-of-science Debate\n1.1 The Bankruptcy-of-science Debate\n\nThe issue of theory-change in science was debated in the context of\nthe \u2018bankruptcy of science\u2019 controversy that was raging in\nParis in the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first\ndecade of the twentieth. A claim of growing popular reputation among\nvarious public intellectuals, spearheaded by Ferdinand\nBruneti\u00e8re and Leo Tolstoy, was that scientific theories are\nephemeral; and this was supposed to prove that science has at best no\nmore than predictive value with no legitimate claim to showing what\nthe world is like\u2014especially in its unobservable aspects. In\nlight of a growing interest in the history of science among scientists\nand philosophers, it was pointed out that science has had a poor track\nrecord: it has gone through many radical theory-changes in the past;\nhence, there is reason to believe that what is currently\naccepted will be overturned in the future.\n\nIn his essay \u201cThe Non-Acting\u201d, published in French in\nAugust 1893, the Russian novelist Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) noted:\n\n\nLastly, does not each year produce its new scientific discoveries,\nwhich after astonishing the boobies of the whole world and bringing\nfame and fortune to the inventors, are eventually admitted to be\nridiculous mistakes even by those who promulgated them? (\u2026)\nUnless then our century forms an exception (which is a supposition we\nhave no right to make), it needs no great boldness to conclude by\nanalogy that among the kinds of knowledge occupying the attention of\nour learned men and called science, there must necessarily be some\nwhich will be regarded by our descendants much as we now regard the\nrhetoric of the ancients and the scholasticism of the Middle Ages.\n(1904: 105)\n\n\nA few years earlier, in 1889, Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re\n(1849\u20131906), Professor at the \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure and editor of the prestigious journal Revue\ndes Deux Mondes, noted in his review of Paul Bourget\u2019s play\n\u2018Le Disciple\u2019:\n\n\nWe differ from animals in recognizing that humans have to be first\n(i.e., they have value). The laws of nature, the \u2018struggle for\nlife\u2019 or \u2018natural selection\u2019, do not show what we\nhave in common. Are these the only laws? Do we know whether perhaps\ntomorrow they will not join in the depths of oblivion the Cartesian\nvortices or the \u2018quiddities\u2019 of scholasticism? (1889: 222,\nauthor\u2019s translation)\n\n\nThis history-fed pessimism about science, which seemed to capture the\npublic mood, led to a spirited reaction by the scientific community.\nIn an anonymous article that appeared in Revue Scientifique,\na prestigious semi-popular scientific journal, in August 17 1889, the\nfollowing questions were raised: Is the history of science the history\nof human error? Will what theories affirm today be affirmed in a\ncentury or two? The reply was:\n\n\nWe will say to savants, philosophers and physicists, physicians,\nchemists, astronomers or geologists: Go forward boldly, without\nlooking behind you, without caring for the consequences, reasonable or\nabsurd, that can be drawn from your work. Seek the truth, without the\nworry of its applications. (Anonymous 1889: 215, author\u2019s\ntranslation)\n\n\nA few years later, in 1895, Bruneti\u00e8re strikes back with an\narticle titled \u2018Apr\u00e8s Une Visite Au\nVatican\u2019, published in Revue des Deux Mondes, by\nclaiming that science is bankrupt:\n\n\nScience has failed to deliver on its promise to change \u2018the face\nof the world\u2019. (...) Even if this is not a total bankruptcy, it\nis certainly a partial bankruptcy, enough to shake off the credit from\nscience. (1895: 98, 103)\n\n\nThe eminent scientist Charles Richet (1850\u20131935), Professor of\nPhysiology at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Editor of Revue\nScientifique and Nobel Laureate for Medicine in 1913, replied\nwith an article titled \u2018La Science a-t-elle fait\nbanqueroute?\u2019 (Revue Scientifique, 12 January\n1895), which appeared in the section: Histoire des Sciences.\nIn this, he did three things. Firstly, he noted that science can never\nunderstand the \u2018why\u2019 (\u2018le pourquoi\u2019)\nof things, especially when it comes to the infinitely small and the\ninfinitely large. Science \u201cattends only to the phenomena. The\nintimate nature of things escapes from us\u201d (1895: 34). Secondly,\nhe stressed that \u201cscience has not promised anything\u201d, let\nalone the discovery of the essence of things. Thirdly, he added that\ndespite the fact that science has made no promises, it has changed the\nworld, citing various scientific, industrial and technological\nsuccesses (from the invention of printing and the microscope to the\nrailways, the electric battery, the composition of the air, and the\nnature of fermentation).\n\nTurning Bruneti\u00e8re\u2019s argument on its head, Richet\nformulated what might be called an \u2018optimistic induction\u2019\nbased on the then recent history of scientific successes. To those who\nclaim that science has failed in the past, his reply is that history\nshows that it is unreasonable to claim for any scientific question\nthat we will always fail to answer it. Far from warranting epistemic\npessimism, the history of science is a source of cognitive optimism.\nRichet referred to a few remarkable cases, the most striking of which\nis the case of Jean Louis Prevost and Jean Baptiste Dumas, who had\nwritten in 1823:\n\n\nThe pointlessness of our attempts to isolate the colouring matter of\nthe blood gives us almost the certainty that one will never be able to\nfind it. (1823, 246, author\u2019s translation)\n\n\nForty years after their bold statement, Richet exclaimed, this\ncoloured matter (haemoglobin) had been isolated, analysed and\nstudied.\n\nRichet\u2019s reply to the historical challenge suggested lowering\nthe epistemic bar for science: science describes the phenomena and\ndoes not go beyond them to their (unobservable) causes. This attitude\nwas echoed in the reply to the \u2018bankruptcy charge\u2019 issued\nby the eminent chemist and politician of the French Third Republic,\nMarcelin Berthelot (1827\u20131907) in his pamphlet Science et\nMorale in 1897. He was firm in his claim that the alleged\nbankruptcy of science is an illusion of the non-scientific mind. Like\nRichet, he also argued that science has not pretended to have\npenetrated into the essence of things: \u201cunder the words\n\u2018essence\u2019, \u2018the nature of things\u2019, we hide the\nidols of our own imagination\u201d (1897: 18, author\u2019s\ntranslation). Science, he noted, has as its starting point the study\nof facts and aims to establish general relations, that is,\n\u2018scientific laws\u2019, on their basis. If science does not aim\nfor more, we cannot claim that it is bankrupt; we cannot accuse it for\n\u201caffirmations it did not make, or hopes it has not\n aroused\u201d.[1]\n\nBerthelot, who objected to atomism, captured a broad positivist trend\nin French science at the end of the nineteenth century, according to\nwhich science cannot offer knowledge of anything other than the\nphenomena. In light of this view, the history-fed pessimism is\nmisguided precisely because there has been substantial continuity at\nthe level of the description of the phenomena, even if explanatory\ntheories have come and gone.\n",
