    "main_text": "The Later-Scholastic Tradition || St. Bonaventure: Conscience as Cognitive/Synderesis as Affective\n3.1 St. Bonaventure: Conscience as Cognitive/Synderesis as Affective\n\nOne of the most prominent representatives of the Franciscan\nintellectual tradition, Bonaventure (1217\u20131274) lectured on the\nSentences at Paris from 1250 until 1252, when he became\nregent master in the theology faculty, a position he held until 1257.\nHis commentary on the Sentences is the fruit of these\nlectures, and it is in this work that he discusses the topics of\nconscience and synderesis. For Bonaventure we not only possess innate\nmoral knowledge, but we also have an inextinguishable inclination\ntowards achieving the good. Our inborn knowledge of the former, that\nis, of the natural law, is associated with conscience, which resides\nin the intellect, while our inclination towards desiring the good is\nassociated with synderesis, which inheres in the will.\n\nWhat is the ontological status of conscience? According to\nBonaventure, just as theologians have disagreed over the nature of\n\u201cthought\u201d, defining it variously as the power of thinking,\na habit or an apprehended principle of knowledge, so too have they\ndiffered over how to define \u201cconscience\u201d\n(conscientia). Most commonly, however, the term has been used\nto refer to a cognitive habit or disposition that relates to the\npractical as opposed to the theoretical intellect. Indeed, it is the\ndisposition that perfects the practical intellect. How so? Through its\nconsciousness of the principles that comprise the natural\nlaw\u2014such as that \u201cGod is to be honoured\u201d\u2014and\nthrough the issuing of such injunctions to the will. As Bonaventure\nputs it:\n\n\ntheoretical knowledge perfects our thought to the extent that the\nlatter is theoretical, whereas conscience is a disposition perfecting\nour thought to the extent that it is practical, or to the extent that\nit directs us towards deeds. (Bonaventure, commentary on the\nSentences, 2.39: a. 1, q. 1; Potts trans. 1980: 111)\n\n\nIs such a disposition innate or acquired? It is possible, according to\nBonaventure, to find authorities on both sides of the debate. For the\nopinion that conscience is innate, Bonaventure cites, among other\nauthorities, St. Paul\u2019s famous reference to a moral law that is\n\u201cwritten on [men\u2019s] hearts\u201d in Romans 1:14\u201315.\nHe also appeals to a \u201cnatural instinct to seek blessedness and\n[to] honor [one\u2019s] parents\u201d (commentary on the\nSentences, 2.39: a. 1, q. 2; McGrade trans. 2001:\n175\u2013176). For the opinion that conscience is not innate, on the\nother hand, Bonaventure cites Aristotle\u2019s claim that the soul is\na blank slate. Bonaventure\u2019s solution is to find a middle\nposition between St. Paul, on the one hand, and Aristotle, on the\nother. His conclusion: conscience is part innate, part acquired.\n\nIn what sense is it innate? Just as rational creatures have a natural\ncapacity to judge the veracity of first principles in the realm of\nspeculative reason, so we have an innate capacity to judge the first\nprinciples of practical reason. This innate capacity to immediately\ngrasp such principles as true or not in the realm of practical reason\nis called conscience. It is associated, for Bonaventure, with the\nAugustinian \u201cnatural light\u201d\u2014or \u201cnatural\ntribunal\u201d\u2014that is built into the structure of the mind and\nwhich permits rational agents to intuitively grasp the basic\nprinciples of the natural law (see, e.g., Augustine, City of\nGod, 11.27, Bettenson trans. 1972: 461\u2013462). Just as the\nmind is disposed to grasp, in the realm of theoretical reason, the\naxiomatic nature of such propositions as that \u201call bachelors are\nunmarried males\u201d, so too it has a innate disposition to grasp as\nself-evidently true such basic principles in the domain of practical\nreason as \u201cHonour thy father and mother\u201d and \u201cDo not\nharm thy neighbour\u201d.\n\nIn what sense, though, is conscience acquired? Although the ability to\njudge the deontic propositions of the natural law as self-evidently\ntrue is innate, it does not follow that the contents of such\npropositions are innate. It does not follow, that is, that the\nconcepts \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d in the precept\nto honor one\u2019s parents are in the mind from birth. And indeed,\nso Bonaventure thinks, they are not. Rather, they are species or\nlikenesses acquired through sense experience which, once acquired,\nform the terms of the universal propositions of the natural law that\nare intuitively grasped. In this sense, Bonaventure is true to\nAristotle:\n\n\nFor everyone agrees that there is an imparted light of the\napprehensory potentiality which is called a natural tribunal, but we\nacquire forms and likenesses of things by means of the senses, as\nAristotle says explicitly in many places, and as experience also\nteaches us. (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 2;\nPotts trans. 1980: 113)\n\n\nConscience, then, is partly innate and partly acquired with respect to\nthe content of the natural law. But what is the relationship of such\nuniversal premises to the conclusions of practical reason? How does\nthe agent proceed from a general knowledge of right and wrong to the\napplication of this knowledge to concrete situations? After all, such\nuniversal premises are only useful to the extent that they can be\napplied. For Bonaventure, the habit of directing the agent toward\napplying the general principles of the natural law to specific\nactions, like the habit of immediately grasping deontic principles, is\ninnate. But in order to apply this self-evident knowledge we must\nacquire further knowledge. For example, although we grasp a\npriori the truth that one should honor one\u2019s father and\nmother, we have no innate knowledge that John and Mary are our parents\nand that it is they specifically who must be honoured as opposed to,\nsay, Michael and Jane. Rather, this type of knowledge is derived from\nexperience and instruction.\n\nNote that conscience does not simply move from the general to the\nparticular with respect to concrete actions. It also moves from the\ngeneral to the specific with respect to propositions themselves. As\nPotts points out, there are in fact two classes of deontic\npropositions: basic and derived (Potts 1982: 698). Consider the\ndeontic proposition to obey God, which is basic, or maximally evident.\nObviously, other more specific precepts can be derived from this very\ngeneral one. Historically, for instance, from the basic deontic\nproposition to obey God the Jews derived the further, less evident but\nmore specific deontic propositions to refrain from eating pork and to\ncircumcise their sons. How did they come to know these more specific\npropositions? By means of a revealed commandment\u2014via (divine)\ninstruction, in other words (commentary on the Sentences\n2.39: a. 2, q. 3, ad 4; Potts trans. 1980: 120). Although the\ndistinction between basic and derived deontic propositions is\nPotts\u2019, and although the case cited is an example of an\nerroneous conscience (Bonaventure argues that male circumcision and\nthe prohibition on eating pork are no longer applicable), it\naccurately sums up Bonaventure\u2019s distinction between\npropositions that are \u201cvery clearly evident\u201d versus those\nthat are \u201cless evident\u201d:\n\n\nJust as some things that are cognizable are very clearly evident, such\nas axioms and first principles, while some are less evident, such as\nparticular conclusions, so also in things that can be done, some are\nevident in the highest degree, for example, \u201cDo not do to\nanother what you do not want done to you\u201d and that one should\nsubmit to God and suchlike. In the same way, then, as the cognition of\nfirst principles is said to be innate in us by reason of that light,\nbecause (due to their self-evidence) that light suffices for cognizing\nthem (after the reception of species) without any additional\npersuasion, so also the cognition of moral first principles is innate\nin us, in that that judicatory suffices for cognizing them. Again, in\nthe same way as cognition of the particular conclusions of the\nsciences is acquired, because the light innate in us does not fully\nsuffice for knowing them, but some persuasion and fuller acquaintance\nare needed, so on the side of things that can be done we must\nunderstand, similarly, that we are bound to do some things which we\nknow only through additional instruction. (commentary on the\nSentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 2; McGrade trans 2001: 179)\n\n\nThis distinction between basic, or very general principles, and\nspecific or derived precepts is germane to the question of whether\nconscience can ever be mistaken and, if so, whether in such cases it\ncontinues to bind. Bonaventure\u2019s response is that we can never\nbe mistaken about basic deontic propositions. Rather, it is with\nrespect to derived ones that we sometimes err since\n\n\nalthough conscience is always right so long as it sticks to the\ngeneral and is moved by simple inspection, it can become mistaken when\nit descends to particulars and brings things together, because the\nactualisation of deliberative reason is mixed with it. (commentary on\nthe Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 3, ad 4; Potts trans. 1980:\n120)\n\n\nIs one obliged to always follow one\u2019s conscience? It depends,\nsince conscience is fallible. If what it dictates is in accordance\nwith God\u2019s will, then one is obliged to follow it on pain of\neternal damnation. If erroneous\u2014if what it dictates is contrary\nto the divine will\u2014as is sometimes the case when applying basic\ndeontological principles, then conscience does not bind. Rather, the\nagent has an obligation to correct the error in order to bring his\nconscience into line with the natural law. If he does not, and follows\nhis erroneous conscience, he commits a mortal sin. \u201cIt is clear\nthat conscientia always either binds us to do what it tells\nus, or binds us to change it\u201d (commentary on the\nSentences 2.39: a. 1, q. 3; Potts trans. 1980:\n114\u2013115). Obviously, then, the intellect plays an important role\nin achieving happiness given its possession of conscience. But what of\nthe will? Does it not have an equally important role to play in the\nmoral life? Yes: in its possession of synderesis. In line with\ntradition, Bonaventure calls synderesis the \u201cspark of\nconscience\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2;\nMcGrade trans. 2001: 186). He breaks with tradition, however, in\narguing that it inheres in the will rather than in the intellect.\nIndeed synderesis, for Bonaventure, is precisely the counterpart of\nconscience insofar as the will, like the intellect, has an innate\ninclination towards the moral (as opposed to the useful) good. In the\ncase of the intellect this disposition takes the form of the\n\u201cnatural light\u201d of conscience that apprehends the first\nprinciples of the natural law; in the case of the will, it takes the\nform of synderesis: a \u201cnatural bias\u201d towards desiring the\nmoral good. There is one sense, however, in which synderesis is not\nexactly analogous to conscience. While it looks very much like a\nhabit, synderesis is rather, according to Bonaventure (presumably\nfollowing Philip the Chancellor), a habit-like power of the soul\n(commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 1; Potts trans.\n1980: 116\u2013117).\n\nCan synderesis ever be extinguished? No: it is an innate orientation\ntowards goodness that cannot be completely eradicated, ontologically\nspeaking, even in the most vicious of people. In its exercise,\nhowever, it can become impeded \u201ceither by the darkness of\nblindness, or by the wantonness of pleasure, or by the hardness of\nobstinacy\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q.\n2; Potts trans. 1980: 117). In such cases, synderesis ceases to\n\u201cmurmur\u201d against evil or \u201cgoad\u201d towards the\ngood, either because the agent is blinded by ignorance, distracted by\nphysical pleasure or is so stubbornly persistent in their depravity\nthat they cannot reorient themselves towards the good. Still, when\nsynderesis follows the innate judgement of conscience with respect to\nbasic deontic principles, which can never err, then it too functions\ncorrectly because that is its natural state. It has the potential to\ngo wrong and fall into sin only during the exercise of deliberation\nwith respect to particular truths since it is here that reason can\nbecome faulty and the will, which is free, disordered. When reason and\nwill malfunction synderesis is \u201coverthrown, in that its effect\nand its government over the other deliberative powers is repulsed and\nbroken\u201d (commentary on the Sentences 2.39: a. 2, q. 3;\nPotts trans. 1980: 119). When this happens, the agent sins.\n",
