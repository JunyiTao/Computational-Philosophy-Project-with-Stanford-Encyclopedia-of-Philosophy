    "main_text": "\n\nThe frequent excursions which I have made into this province have\nall sprung from the profound conviction that the foundations of science\nas a whole, and of physics in particular, await their next greatest\nelucidations from the side of biology, and especially, from the\nanalysis of the sensations. [Mach, Analysis of Sensations,\nPreface to 1st Edition]\n\n\nErnst Mach (February 18, 1838 \u2013 February 19, 1916) made major\ncontributions to physics, philosophy, and physiological\npsychology. In physics, the speed of sound bears his name, as he was\nthe first to systematically study super-sonic motion. He also made\nimportant contributions to understanding the Doppler effect. His\ncritique of Newtonian ideas of absolute space and time were an\ninspiration to the young Einstein, who credited Mach as being the\nphilosophical forerunner of relativity theory. His systematic\nskepticism of the old physics was similarly important to a generation\nof young German physicists.\n\n\nIn philosophy, he is best known for his influence upon the Vienna\nCircle (a predecessor of which was named the Ernst Mach Verein), for\nhis famous anti-metaphysical attitude (which developed into the\nverifiability theory of meaning), for his anti-realist stance in\nopposition to atomism, and in general for his positivist-empiricist\napproach to epistemology. It is important to note that some of these\ninfluences are currently being re-examined, and are now thought to be\nboth more tenuous and more complicated than was once assumed. He was\nalso an important historian of science, and occupied the Chair for the\nPhilosophy of the Inductive Sciences at the University of\nVienna. Although previous philosophers had commented on science and\nmany scientists had influenced philosophy, Mach more than anyone else\nbridged the divide; he is a founder of the philosophy of science.\n\n\nIn psychology, he studied the relationship of our sensations to\nexternal stimuli. Space, time, color, sound, once the domain of\nphysics, were now also being studied by psychologists and conceived of\nas not only the stuff of the physical external world but also the\nelements of our inner experience. Mach was deeply inspired by\nGustav Fechner\u2019s psychophysics here. Psychologists today\nregard him as a founder of Gestalt theory as well as the discoverer of\nneural inhibition. Importantly, although in the twentieth century\nhe was better known to philosophers for his influence upon physics and\nthe philosophy of physics, it was psychology that was the primary\ndriving force behind his philosophy of science.\n\n\nIn his later years (1901), Mach was appointed to the Austrian\nParliament, where he was known as a reformer. His intellectual\ninfluence amongst leftists was so great that Lenin wrote a book,\nMaterialism and Empirico-Criticism, criticizing Machian\nanti-materialism.\n",
