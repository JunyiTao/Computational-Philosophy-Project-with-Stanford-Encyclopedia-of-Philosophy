    "main_text": "Critiques of Privacy || The Communitarian Critique\n2.3 The Communitarian Critique\n\nCommunitarian approaches find it suspicious that many recent theories\nof privacy rely on the concept of individual (negative) freedom as the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre for privacy, and it is this connection\nbetween privacy and freedom or autonomy that is called into question\n(see Roessler 2008: 699). Privacy in communitarian thought is instead\nconceived of as a realm or dimension of life concerned with specific\npractices, also (or even primarily) relevant to the community\nat large. Accordingly, these practices must be understood not as a\nrealm to which the individual has a claim qua autonomous\nbeing, but as one conceded to the individual as a member of the\ncommunity (Sandel 1982; Elshtain 1995; Etzioni 1999 & 2004).\n\nThe idea underlying the communitarian point of view, particularly that\nof Sandel (1982), is that liberal theories of privacy necessarily\nconceive the self as disembodied and egocentric in nature. This is not\nonly inconsistent in epistemological terms but also normatively\nundesirable from a political perspective, because communities and\ncommunal practices already take priority over the formation of\nindividual identity. Communitarians therefore claim that privacy\nshould not primarily be understood as an individual right to (physical\nor sexual) self-determination, but rather as protection given to\npractices that depend on being sheltered from the view of others\n(Etzioni 1999: 183; 2004: 30). Etzioni\u2019s concept of privacy\ncomprises its decisional, informational, as well as local (the privacy\nof the home) aspects (Etzioni 1999). The communitarian viewpoint has\nbeen criticized, however (e.g., Jean Cohen 2002: 42). These critics\nargue that it is incorrect to hold that a theory of privacy based on\nthe idea of individual freedom and autonomy cannot at the same time\nconceive of the self as relational in nature, and as constituted and\ncontextualized in a variety of respects. Feminist theories of privacy\ninsist that individual rights come before communal duties, because it\nis otherwise impossible to guarantee equal freedom to take\ndecisions pertaining to one\u2019s life and one\u2019s body. In\nparticular, communal practices and traditions may prove repressive and\ndiscriminatory, making an individual right to privacy indispensable\n(Allen 1988: 700; Fraser 1992; Morris 2000).\n",
