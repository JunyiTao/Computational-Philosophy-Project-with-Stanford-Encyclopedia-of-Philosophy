    "main_text": "Ferguson and the social state\n12. Dugald Stewart on history and philosophy\n\nOne colleague of Blair and Ferguson at Edinburgh University was Dugald\nStewart (1753\u20131828), who was a student first at Edinburgh, and\nthen at Glasgow where his moral philosophy professor was Thomas Reid.\nStewart succeeded his father in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh,\nand then in 1785 became professor of pneumatic and moral philosophy at\nEdinburgh when Ferguson resigned the chair. Stewart shared with\nFerguson an interest in the kind of historical inquiry that explored\nhow societies operate. In his Account of the Life and Writings of\nAdam Smith LL.D. Dugald Stewart says of one of Smith\u2019s\nworks, the Dissertation on the Origin of Languages (Smith\n[LRB], pp. 201\u201326), that \u201cit deserves our attention less,\non account of the opinions it contains, than as a specimen of a\nparticular sort of inquiry, which, so far as I know, is entirely of\nmodern origin\u201d (Smith 1795, p. 292). Stewart then spells out the\n\u2018particular sort of inquiry\u2019 that he has in mind. He notes\nthe lack of direct evidence for the origin of language, of the arts\nand the sciences, of political union, and so on, and affirms:\n\u201cIn this want of direct evidence, we are under a necessity of\nsupplying the place of fact by conjecture; and when we are unable to\nascertain how men have actually conducted themselves upon particular\noccasions, of considering in what manner they are likely to have\nproceeded, from the principles of their nature, and the circumstances\nof their external situation\u201d (Smith 1795, p. 293).\n\nFor Stewart such enquiries are of practical importance, for by them\n\u201ca check is given to that indolent philosophy, which refers to a\nmiracle, whatever appearances, both in the natural and moral worlds,\nit is unable to explain\u201d (Smith 1795, p. 293). Stewart uses the\nterm \u2018conjectural history\u2019 for the sort of history\nexemplified by Smith\u2019s account of the origin of language.\nConjectural history works against the illegitimate encroachment of\nreligion into the lives of people who are too quick to reach for God\nas the solution to a problem when extrapolation from scientifically\nestablished principles of human nature would provide a solution\nsatisfying to the intellect. Knowing what we do about human nature,\nabout our intellect and will, our emotions and fundamental beliefs, we\nask how people would have behaved in given circumstances. Love and\nhate, anger and jealousy, joy and fear, do not change much through the\ngenerations. Much the same things, speaking generally, have much the\nsame effect first on the emotions and then on behaviour. Dugald\nStewart formulates the principle underlying conjectural history: it\nhas \u201clong been received as an incontrovertible logical maxim\nthat the capacities of the human mind have been in all ages the same,\nand that the diversity of phenomena exhibited by our species is the\nresult merely of the different circumstances in which men are\nplaced\u201d (Stewart 1854\u201358, vol. 1, p. 69).\n\nAs regards the credentials of Stewart\u2019s \u2018incontrovertible\nlogical maxim\u2019, if the claim that human nature is invariant is\nan empirical claim, it must be based on observation of our\ncontemporaries and on evidence of people\u2019s lives in other places\nand at other times. Such evidence needs however to be handled with\ncare. The further back we go the more meagre it is, and so the more we\nneed to conjecture to supplement the few general facts available to\nus. Indeed we can go back so far that we have no facts beyond the\ngeneralities that we have worked out in the light of our experience.\nBut to rely on conjecture in order to support the very principle that\nforms the first premiss in any exercise in conjectural history is to\ncome suspiciously close to arguing in a circle. The incontrovertible\nlogical maxim of Dugald Stewart should probably be accorded at most\nthe status of a well-supported empirical generalisation.\n\nConjectural history is certainly not pure guesswork. We argue on the\nbasis of observed uniformities, and the more experience we have of\ngiven uniformities the greater credence we will give to reports that\nspeak of the occurrence of the uniformities, whether they concern dead\nmatter or living people and their institutions. In a famous passage\nHume writes: \u201cWhether we consider mankind according to the\ndifference of sexes, ages, governments, conditions, or methods of\neducation; the same uniformity and regular operation of natural\nprinciples are discernible. Like causes still produce like effects; in\nthe same manner as in the mutual action of the elements and powers of\nnature\u201d (Hume [T], p. 401).\n\nFor Hume the chief point about the similarity between ourselves and\nour ancestors is that histories greatly contribute to the scientific\naccount of human nature by massively extending our otherwise very\nlimited observational data base. Hume writes: \u201cMankind are so\nmuch the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of\nnothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to\ndiscover the constant and universal principles of human nature, by\nshowing men in all varieties of circumstances and situations, and\nfurnishing us with materials from which we may form our observations\nand become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and\nbehaviour. These records of wars, intrigues, factions, and\nrevolutions, are so many collections of experiments, by which the\npolitician or moral philosopher fixes the principles of his science,\nin the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes\nacquainted with the nature of plants, minerals, and other external\nobjects, by the experiments which he forms concerning them\u201d\n(Hume [E], pp. 83\u201384). On this account of history, it is perhaps\nthe single most important resource for the philosopher seeking to\nconstruct a scientific account of human nature. Among the historians\nproduced by eighteenth century Scotland were Turnbull, Hume,\nSmith, Ferguson and William Robertson. In light of Hume\u2019s\nobservation it is not surprising that so much history was written by\nmen prominent for their philosophical writings on human nature.\n",
