    "main_text": "Feminist \u201cHard Cases\u201d || Self-abnegation\n2.1 Self-abnegation\n\nSeveral theorists (e.g., Westlund 2003, 483\u20134; Oshana 2006,\n57\u201358) invoke Virginia Woolf\u2019s critique of Coventry\nPatmore\u2019s poem \u201cAngel in the House\u201d to motivate\ndiscussions of autonomy:\n\nShe was intensely sympathetic. She was immensely charming. She\nexcelled in the difficult arts of family life. She sacrificed herself\ndaily. If there was chicken, she took the leg, if there was a draught,\nshe sat in it. (Woolf 1942, 59)\n\n\nAndrea Westlund observes that the Angel resembles Thomas Hill\u2019s\nwell-known example of the Deferential Wife (Westlund 2003,\n485\u20136):\n\nShe buys the clothes he prefers, invites the guests\nhe wants to entertain, and makes love whenever he is\nin the mood. She willingly moves to a new city in order for him to\nhave a more attractive job, counting her own friendships and\ngeographical preferences insignificant by comparison... She does not\nsimply defer to her husband in certain spheres as a trade-off for his\ndeference in other spheres. On the contrary, she tends not to form her\nown interests, values, and ideals, and when she does, she counts them\nas less important than her husband\u2019s. (Hill 1991, 5)\n\n\nOne would think that such excessive deference would be incompatible\nwith autonomy. Excessive deference implies that others, not the agent\nherself, are driving the agent\u2019s choice and preference\nformation. However, Westlund points out that on some popular accounts\nof autonomy, because the woman is willing to subordinate\nherself or, because she prefers deference and values her own\nopinions and interests less than she values those of her husband, she\nmay be considered autonomous. For example, on one influential account,\nthat of Harry Frankfurt, a preference is autonomous if it is one with\nwhich the agent wholeheartedly identifies (Frankfurt 1988). As\nWestlund argues, the agent here seems to identify wholeheartedly with\nher preference for deference to her husband: \u201cHill\u2019s\ncharacter is remarkable in part because she seems so\nunambivalent about her subservient role\u201d (Westlund\n2003, 491).\n\nThe example is of interest to feminists in the first place because the\ndeference and apparent preference for subservience it describes is\ngendered. It is an outcome of systems of gender oppression\nthat women are expected to assume servile roles, and hence may come to\nendorse, prefer or willingly adopt them. Moreover, perhaps precisely\nbecause of the connection between these kinds of preferences and\nsystems of gender oppression, many feminists resist the conclusion\nthat the Angel and the Deferential Wife are autonomous. Thus Susan\nBabbitt argues that although the Deferential Wife appears to have made\na rational judgment about what she values, and appears therefore to be\nliving according to her own life-plans, in fact the preference for\nsubservience is incompatible with her autonomy: \u201chabitual\nservility\u201d defines her sense of self, and this is \u201cnot the\nkind of self to which a concept of autonomy can be applied\u201d\n(Babbitt 1993, 250). If this is right, influential accounts of\nautonomy, and those feminist positions influenced by them, will have\nto be revised. (See the entry on \u201cFeminist Moral\nPsychology\u201d for more discussion of the example of the\nDeferential Wife.)\n",
