    "main_text": "Information Technologies of Morality || Information Technology as a Moral System\n4.3 Informational Organisms as Moral Agents\n\nThe most comprehensive literature that argues in favor of the prospect\nof using information technology to create artificial moral agents is\nthat of Luciano Floridi (1999, 2002, 2003, 2010b, 2011b), and Floridi\nwith Jeff W. Sanders (1999, 2001, 2004). Floridi (1999) recognizes\nthat issues raised by the ethical impacts of information technologies\nstrain our traditional moral theories. To relieve this friction he\nargues that what is needed is a broader philosophy of information\n(2002). After making this move, Floridi (2003) claims that information\nis a legitimate environment of its own and that has its own intrinsic\nvalue that is in some ways similar to the natural environment and in\nother ways radically foreign but either way the result is that\ninformation is on its own a thing that is worthy of ethical concern.\nFloridi (2003) uses these ideas to create a theoretical model of moral\naction using the logic of object oriented programming. \n\nHis model has seven components; 1) the moral agent a, 2) the moral\npatient p (or more appropriately, reagent), 3) the\ninteractions of these agents, 4) the agent\u2019s frame of\ninformation, 5) the factual information available to the agent\nconcerning the situation that agent is attempting to navigate, 6) the\nenvironment the interaction is occurring in, and 7) the situation in\nwhich the interaction occurs (Floridi 2003, 3). Note that there is no\nassumption of the ontology of the agents concerned in the moral\nrelationship modeled and these agents can be any mixture or artificial\nor natural in origin (Sullins 2009a).\n\nThere is additional literature which critiques arguments such as\nFloridi\u2019s with the hope of expanding the idea of automated moral\nreasoning so that one can speak of many different types of automated\nmoral technologies form simple applications all the way to full moral\nagents with rights and responsibilities similar to humans (Adam 2008;\nAnderson and Anderson 2011; Johnson and Powers 2008; Schmidt 2007;\nWallach and Allen 2010).\n\nWhile scholars recognize that we are still some time from creating\ninformation technology that would be unequivocally recognized as an\nartificial moral agent, there are strong theoretical arguments in\nsuggesting that automated moral reasoning is an eventual possibility\nand therefore it is an appropriate area of study for those interested\nin the moral impacts of information technologies.\n",
