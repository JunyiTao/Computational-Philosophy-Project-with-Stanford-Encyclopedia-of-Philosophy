    "main_text": "Non-Paradigmatic Relational Situations || A Shifting Conception of Relations\n5.2 A Shifting Conception of Relations\n\n\nThe distinction between real relations and relations of reason has a\nnumber of important consequences for the development of medieval\ntheories of relations. For one thing, it enables philosophers to\nintroduce a number of refinements and distinctions within the\ncategory of relations. By the mid-thirteenth century, for example, it\nbecomes common to say that the category of relations is unique in\nallowing mere beings of reason among the things signified by its terms.\nTo quote from Aquinas who is representative in this regard:\n\n\nThe other genera introduce something in extramental reality just by\nvirtue of what they are. Thus, quantity introduces something just by\nvirtue of the fact that it is quantity. By contrast, relation alone\nis such that it does not introduce anything in extramental reality,\njust by virtue of what it is\u2014for it does not predicate a\nsomething but a toward something. Hence we find\ncertain relations that do not introduce anything in extramental\nreality, but only in reason. (De veritate, q. 1, a. 5, ad 15.)\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Aquinas and others appeal to this special feature of the\ncategory of relations (namely, that the things signified by its\nterms can either be real beings or mere beings of reason) to provide a\nsystematic division of relations or pairs of correlatives into three\ndifferent types, depending on whether their members are\nboth real, both conceptual, or mixed (one real, one conceptual). To\nquote again from Aquinas:\n\n\nIt must be known that, since a relation requires two\nrelata, there are three ways in which it can be something real\nor conceptual:\n\n\n\n[1] Sometimes it is a mere being of reason on the part of both\nrelata, namely, when the order or [relative] disposition\ncannot exist between things except in virtue of the apprehension of\nreason alone. For example, when we say that something is identical to\nitself. For in virtue of the fact that reason apprehends the one thing\ntwice, it regards it as two; and in this way it apprehends a certain\n[relative] disposition of a thing to itself. And the same thing is true\nof all relations between being and non-being, which reason forms\ninsofar as it apprehends a non-being as a certain relatum.\nAgain, the same is true of all relations that follow upon the activity\nof reason, such as genus and species, and the like.\n\n\n[2] Now there are other relations that are real as regards both\nrelata, namely, whenever there is a [relative] disposition\nbetween two things in virtue of something really belonging to each of\nthem\u2014as is clear from all relations that follow on quantity, such\nas large and small, double and half, and things of this sort. For there\nis a quantity in both relata. And the same is true of\nrelations that follow on action and passion, such as mover and movable,\nfather and son, and the like.\n\n\n[3] Sometimes, however, a relation is something real in one of the\nrelata and a mere being of reason in the other. And this\nhappens whenever the two relata do not belong to a single\norder. For example, sense perception and knowledge are related to\nthings that are sensible and intelligible. But insofar as the latter\nare things existing in extramental reality, they are outside the order\nof sensible and intelligible being. And so there is a real relation in\nthe knowledge and sense perception in virtue of the fact that they are\n[really] ordered to things that can be known or sensed. However,\nthings [that can be known or sensed] are outside this sort of order\n[when] considered in themselves, and hence there is not really a\nrelation in them to knowledge or sense perception. On the contrary,\nthere is only a relation in them according to reason, insofar as\nthe intellect apprehends them as terms of the relations of knowledge\nand sense perception. This is why the Philosopher says in\nMetaphysics V that they are spoken of relatively, not because\nthey are related to other things, but because other things are related\nto them. Similarly, being to the right is not said of a column unless\nit is placed to the right of some animal. Hence a relation of this\nsort is not really in the column but in the animal. (Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 13, a. 7, corpus.)\n\n\n\nIn this passage, Aquinas contrasts the relations involved in\nparadigmatic relational situations\u2014namely, relations of the\nsecond type\u2014with the relations involved in two sorts\nof non-paradigmatic relational situation. We are already familiar with\nrelations of the third or \u2018mixed\u2019 type from our discussion\nof creation and intentional relations. Moreover, we can see that\nAquinas follows the common medieval practice of connecting relations\nof this type with both Aristotle\u2019s discussion in the\nMetaphysics and the Boethius-inspired example of the column.\nWe have yet, however, to encounter relations of the first type. These\nare relations comprised by pairs of properties or accidents both of\nwhose members are beings of reason. As an example of this type of\nrelation, Aquinas gives self-identity. When we conceive of a situation\ninvolving this sort of relation, he says, we conceive of it as if\nit involved two things (\u201ca relation requires two\nrelata\u201d and hence \u201creason apprehends the one\nthing twice\u201d), and also as if the two things were ordered to each\nother by a pair of properties (or \u201c[relative]\ndispositions\u201d).  Obviously, however, there are not distinct\nthings in extramental reality serving as the relata of the\nrelation of self-identity, much less two properties by which such\nrelata are related. Like many other medievals, therefore,\nAquinas concludes that in this case the relations (or relative\ndispositions) are not real, but mere beings of\n reason.[39]\n\n\nThe claim that self-identity is a relation of reason might seem\nworrisome. For insofar as relations of reason depend for their\nexistence on the activity of the mind, it would seem to follow that\nsomething\u2019s being self-identical is mind dependent. But that is\nabsurd.\n\n\nAquinas is aware of this sort of worry. In fact, in one of his\ndisputed questions, he imagines a similar worry leading someone to\ndoubt the view that even God\u2019s relation to his creatures can be\nconsidered a relation of reason:\n\n\nAfter all, if there were no created intellect in existence, God would\nstill be Lord and Creator. But if there were no created intellect in\nexistence, there would not be any beings of reason. Hence\n\u2018Creator\u2019, \u2018Lord\u2019, and terms of this sort, do\nnot express relations of reason. (De potentia, q. 7, a. 11,\nobj. 4.)\n\n\n\n\nThis sort of worry about relations of reason helps to explain what is\nperhaps their most significant effect on the medieval discussion of\nrelations\u2014namely, a gradual shift away from the traditional\nAristotelian characterization of relations. On this characterization,\nas we saw earlier, relations are identified at least partly in terms\nof their metaphysical function\u2014that is to say, they are\nidentified as items that actually serve to relate things. But in order\nto maintain that things can be self-identical apart from the activity\nof any mind, while at the same time maintaining that self-identity is\na relation of reason, medieval philosophers have little choice but to\nmove away from the traditional characterization. And of course the\nsame thing is true in the case of God\u2019s relation to his creatures.\nThus, as Aquinas says in reply to the abovementioned doubt:\n\n\nA man is really (and not merely conceptually) identical to himself,\neven though his relation [of self-identity] is a being of reason. And\nthe explanation for this is that the cause of his relation is\nreal\u2014namely, the unity of his substance, which our intellect\nconsiders under the aspect of a relation. In the same way, the power\nto compel subjects is really in God, and our intellect considers this\npower as ordered to the subjects because of the subjects\u2019 order to\nGod. It is for this reason that he is really said to be Lord, even\nthough his relation is a mere being of reason. And for the same reason\nit is evident that he would be Lord [Creator, etc.] even if there were\nno created intellect in existence. (De potentia q. 7, a. 11,\nad 3\u20135.)\n\n\n\n\nIn this passage, Aquinas makes it clear that in cases involving\nrelations of reason\u2014such as self-identity or God\u2019s\nrelation to the world\u2014the relata are related, not by\ntheir relations (since these are mere beings of reason and hence\ndependent on the activity of the mind), but by what he refers to here\nas the cause of their\n relations.[40]\n Now, in the case of a man\u2019s being self-identical, Aquinas says\nthe cause is just \u201cthe unity of his substance,\u201d where by\nthis he seems to mean that what makes a man identical to himself is\njust the man himself. Again, in the case of God\u2019s being Lord he\nsays that the cause is \u201cthe power to compel subjects\u201d. In\nthe case of God, however, Aquinas does not think the power to compel\nsubjects is distinct from its subject, namely, the divine\nnature. Hence, he maintains that what makes it true that God is Lord\nis nothing but God, his creatures, and some property or attribute of\nthe creatures.\n\n\nIn effect, therefore, reflection on relations of reason brings about a\nshift away from the conception of relations as items that relate, and\nthus forces medieval philosophers to fall back on what they might\notherwise have thought of as an equivalent characterization, namely,\nthe view that relations are items corresponding to or signified by our\ngenuinely relational concepts. Thus, even if self-identity or God\u2019s\nrelation to the world is a mere being of reason, and hence does not\nactually relate its subject to anything, nonetheless it can still be\nregarded as a relation on the grounds that it is signified by a\nrelational concept. Now obviously this shift away from the traditional\nAristotelian conception has the awkward consequence that things can be\nrelated even if their relations do not exist. Thus, Socrates can be\nidentical to himself even if there is no self-identity, God can be\nLord of creation even if his relation of Lordship does not exist, and\nmore generally, a predication of the form \u2018aRb\u2019\ncan be true, even when no predication of form \u2018R-ness\nexists\u2019 is true. Of course, there is nothing ultimately\nincoherent about this consequence, provided we keep in mind that the\nrelations in such cases are mere beings of reason. Nonetheless,\naccepting this consequence does force medieval philosophers to deny\nwhat at least initially appears to be a truth of reason, and at any\nrate is part of common sense\u2014namely, that things are related by\ntheir\n relations.[41]\n\n\nSome philosophers, such as Aquinas, assume that the departure from the\ntraditional Aristotelian characterization of relations is required\nonly in non-paradigmatic relational situations. By the end of the\nMiddle Ages, however, this sort of departure is so common and familiar\nthat philosophers no longer feel the need to regard it as exceptional.\nThus, Ockham eventually adopts a view according to which all relations\ndepend for their existence on the activity of the mind. Indeed, things\nare so changed by the time of Ockham that he feels free not only to\nreject the traditional Aristotelian characterization of relations, but\nalso to modify the standard medieval alternative to it. On his\npreferred characterization, relations are the items corresponding, not\nto all of our relational concepts, but to just one of\nthem\u2014namely, the concept \u2018relation\u2019. As Ockham sees\nit, moreover, the concept \u2018relation\u2019 is a term of second\nintention\u2014that is to say, a term to which only concepts\ncorrespond. Thus, even though Ockham insists that many predications of\nthe form \u2018aRb\u2019 are true independently of the\nmind, he nonetheless maintains that properly speaking relations exist\nonly in the mind as\n concepts.[42]\n This helps to explain why he often expresses his view using such\notherwise unintelligible formulas as: \u201cThis white thing really\nis similar, even though similarity is not really in this white\nthing\u201d (Quodl. VI, q. 22 in Opera Theologica\nix, 669).\n",
