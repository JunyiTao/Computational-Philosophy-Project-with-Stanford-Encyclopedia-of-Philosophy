Direct reference\n\nWithin the orthodox paradigm in the philosophy of mind and language of\nthe 1960\u2019s and 1970\u2019s, there was an important swing of the\npendulum away from the implications of Frege\u2019s and especially\nRussell\u2019s doctrines for intentionality. The so-called\n\u201ctheory of direct reference\u201d has contributed to\nrehabilitate the view that concrete individuals matter more to the\nidentity of the singular thoughts that humans entertain than the\nFrege/Russell doctrines allow. According to Frege\u2019s distinction\nbetween sense and reference, what matters to the identity of a thought\nabout a concrete individual is not the individual thought about but\nthe abstract sense by means of which he is thought about. According to\nRussell, most thoughts that seem prima facie to be about concrete\nindividuals are in fact not singular thoughts but generally quantified\npropositions. Much of the impetus for the theory of direct reference\ncame from the implications of the semantics of modal logic for the\nintentionality of singular thoughts and beliefs.\n\nSaul Kripke (1972) noticed an important difference between the\nbehavior of a proper name and the behavior of a coreferential definite\ndescription expressing a contingent or non-essential property of its\nreferent, in modal contexts. Consider two sentences (9) and (10), each\ncontaining some modal operator like \u2018might\u2019 (that\nexpresses a possibility) and such that the former contains a proper\nname while the latter contains a coreferential definite\ndescription:\n\nJacques Chirac might have been a Socialist.\nThe president of France elected in 2002 might have a been a\nSocialist.\n\n\nThe definite description \u2018the president of France elected in\n2002\u2019 happens to be true of Jacques Chirac of whom it expresses\na contingent property. There certainly exists a metaphysically\npossible world in which either Chirac was not a candidate in the 2002\nFrench presidential elections or he was a candidate but he lost the\nelection.\n\nAn utterance of (9) asserts that there exists a possible world in\nwhich Jacques Chirac is a member of the Socialist party, which he in\nfact is not. Given the deep connection between the speech act of\nassertion and speaker\u2019s belief, an utterance of (9) expresses\nthe counterfactual belief about Chirac that he could have been a\nSocialist. Unlike an utterance of (9), an utterance of (10) is\nambiguous. On one reading, it has the same truth-conditions as does an\nutterance of (9) and it serves to express the same belief.\nAlternatively, an utterance of (10) says of someone who is in fact a\nSocialist, and who therefore is not Chirac, that he could have been\nelected president in 2002.\n\nThus, the following contrast emerges. An utterance of (9) can only\nserve to express a counterfactual belief or thought about Chirac,\ni.e., the belief ascribing to Chirac the counterfactual property of\nbeing a Socialist. An utterance of (10) can serve to express the same\nbelief about Chirac. But it can also serve to express an entirely\ndifferent counterfactual belief about a different individual, who as a\nmatter of fact happens to be a Socialist. This different\ncounterfactual belief would be true e.g., in a possible world in which\nJospin (who is a Socialist) won the 2002 presidential elections.\n\nOn the basis of the fact that, unlike (9), (10) can serve to express\ntwo distinct counterfactual beliefs, Kripke (1972) hypothesizes that a\nproper name is what he calls a rigid designator.\n\u2018Jacques Chirac\u2019 in (9) is rigid for in all possible\nworlds it refers to one and the same concrete individual, i.e., the\nindividual to whom it in fact refers in the actual world. By contrast,\nthe definite description \u2018the president of France elected in\n2002\u2019, which happens to express a contingent property of Chirac,\nis not a rigid designator because it does not pick one and the same\nindividual in all possible worlds. When evaluated with respect to\ndifferent worlds, it is true of different individuals. Of course, some\ndefinite descriptions (e.g., \u2018the square root of 21\u2019) do\nexpress essential properties of what they are true of (in this case, a\nnumber). According to Kripke (1980), unlike proper names, whose\nrigidity is de jure, definite descriptions expressing\nessential properties of an object are rigid de facto. For\nfurther discussion, see the entry on\n reference.\n\nArguably, the goal of the theory of direct reference is to emphasize\nthe depth of the gap between the intentionality of singular thoughts\nand the intentionality of general thoughts. Concrete individuals are\nnot constituents of the contents of the latter. But they are\nconstituents of the contents of the former. Three arguments have been\nbuttressed to dismantle the Russellian disdain for the peculiar\nintentionality of singular thoughts expressible by proper names: a\nmodal argument, an epistemological argument and what can be called a\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d argument.\n\nAccording to the modal argument, if the proper name\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 were just short for some definite description,\ne.g., \u2018the Roman orator who denounced Catiline,\u2019 then it\nwould follow that the sentence \u2018Cicero is the Roman orator who\ndenounced Catiline\u2019 would express a necessary truth,\ni.e., a proposition true in all possible worlds. But this seems\nabsurd: there certainly is a possible world in which Cicero did not\ndenounce Catiline.\n\nAccording to the epistemological argument, from the same assumption,\nit follows that the sentence \u2018Cicero is the Roman orator who\ndenounced Catiline\u2019 expresses a proposition knowable a\npriori, so that it makes no sense to imagine that historians may\ndiscover by empirical research that in fact somebody else denounced\nCatiline or that nobody did. But this too seems absurd.\n\nFinally, according to the transcendental argument, people use proper\nnames in thought and in verbal communication to track, pick out and\nexchange valuable information about concrete particulars. Although\nthey may lack information expressible by some definite\ndescription\u2014let alone by a single definite description\u2014for\nuniquely identifying many concrete particulars, still people manage to\nsecure reference to them. Furthermore, as a person comes to learn more\nand more information about an object or a person, she comes to\nassociate different definite descriptions to the referent of a proper\nname. If follows that no one definite description seems suitable to\ncapture the content of a proper name.\n\nAccording to the theory of direct reference, the function of such\nlinguistic devices as proper names, indexicals and demonstratives is\nto introduce a concrete individual or particular into the proposition\nand/or belief expressed. To use David Kaplan\u2019s (1979, 387)\nrevealing word, a concrete individual is \u201ctrapped\u201d within\na singular proposition. The theory of direct reference seems like a\nuseful antidote against the Frege/Russell tendency to minimize the\ncontribution of concrete particulars to the individuation of human\nsingular thoughts. Three trends of thoughts in recent philosophy of\nmind and language have built on the theory of direct reference. First,\nmany of the insights of the theory of direct reference have been\nextended from thoughts about concrete individuals to thoughts about\nnatural kinds by Kripke (1972) and Putnam (1974). This extension plays\na crucial role in the externalist view of intentional mental states\n(about which see\n section 10).\n Secondly, neo-Fregeans have responded to the challenge of the theory\nof direct reference by providing a suitable notion of\n\u201cobject-dependent\u201d or \u201cde re\u201d sense\n(see Evans, 1982 and McDowell, 1984). (For a response to Frege\u2019s\npuzzle about how two distinct beliefs can be about the same object on\nbehalf of the theory of direct reference, see Salmon, 1986). Thirdly,\nthe metaphysical and epistemological underpinnings of singular\nthoughts (and singular propositions) have given rise to a rich\ndiscussion of the contrast between two broad perspectives:\ndescriptivism and singularism. According to descriptivism, we can only\nthink about objects by thinking about the properties which they\ninstantiate. But according to singularism, not all thoughts about\nobjects are mediated by thoughts about their properties. For further\ndiscussion, see the papers collected in Jeshion (ed.) (2010), in\nparticular Recanati (2010).\n",
