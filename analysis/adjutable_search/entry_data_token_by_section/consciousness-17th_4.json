    "main_text": "Spinoza || Moral Consciousness\n3.1 Moral Consciousness\n\nAs the reference to the \u201cwise man\u201d above suggests,\nSpinoza\u2019s primary use of the term \u201cconsciousness\u201d is\nmoral, but he is making a significant departure from the older sense\nof the term as \u201cmoral conscience.\u201d There is no inner\ntestimony that Spinoza thinks we should heed. Rather, he is focusing\nour attention on how we think of ourselves as a part of the\nnatural order. He uses this concept to draw together his moral,\nepistemological, and metaphysical projects.\n\nIt is significant that Spinoza rarely used the term\nconscientia (in its various forms) in the Ethics,\nand when he does it is almost exclusively in parts 3 through 5, where\nSpinoza is considering the nature of specifically human affects and\nbondage or freedom with respect to them. Indeed, the few times Spinoza\nuses conscientia in Parts 1 and 2, he does so in a way that\npoints forward to its use in the later part of the\n Ethics.[9]\n\nThe proposition in which the term conscientia gets the widest\nuse is 3p9:\n\n\nP9: Both insofar as the Mind has clear and distinct ideas, and\ninsofar as it has confused ideas, it strives, for an indefinite\nduration, to persevere in its being and it is conscious of this\nstriving it has.\n\nDem.: \u2026since the Mind (by IIp23) is conscious of itself through\nideas of the Body\u2019s affections, the Mind (by p7) is conscious of\nits striving.\n\nSchol.: When this striving is related only to the Mind, it is called\nWill; but when it is related to the Mind and Body together, it is\ncalled Appetite. This Appetite, therefore, is nothing but the very\nessence of man, from whose nature there necessarily follow those\nthings that promote his preservation. And so man is determined to do\nthose things.\n\nBetween appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire\nis generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of their\nappetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together\nwith consciousness of the appetite.\n\n\nThe \u201ccontent\u201d of consciousness\u2014what it is we are\nconscious of when we have a mental state with the form\narticulated in 3p9, is best expressed by the following quotation from\nthe appendix to Part 1:\n\n\n[A]ll men are born ignorant of the causes of things, and\u2026they\nall want to seek their own advantage, and are conscious of this\nappetite.\n\nFrom these [assumptions] it follows, first, that men think\nthemselves free, because they are conscious of their volitions and\ntheir appetite, and do not think, even in their dreams, of the causes\nby which they are disposed to wanting and willing, because they are\nignorant of [those causes]. It follows, secondly, that men\nact always on account of an end, viz. on account of their advantage,\nwhich they want. \n\n\nThe transition Spinoza is attempting to effect in his readers is a\ntransition from this sort of consciousness\u2014where we\nfalsely regard ourselves as free, we think of the world as having a\nrich and extensive teleology, and we think of ourselves as agents\nfreely acting on purposes and ends\u2014to another sort of\nconsciousness in which we know ourselves to be part of an\n\u201ceternal necessity\u201d (5p42s). As Spinoza puts it:\n\n\nTherefore, the more each of us is able to achieve this kind of\nknowledge [i.e., the third kind of knowledge], the more he is\nconscious of himself and of God, i.e., the more perfect and blessed he\nis. (5p31s)\n\n\nAnd so the role of consciousness for Spinoza is primarily\nmoral\u2014the moral transition is a transition in the content of our\nconsciousness. But, as already noted, this appears to require some\nvariation between what is strictly represented by the mind and the way\nit appears to the mind in consciousness. To get at this difference,\nwe\u2019ll need to look more closely at the form of\nconsciousness for\n Spinoza.[10]\n\n",
