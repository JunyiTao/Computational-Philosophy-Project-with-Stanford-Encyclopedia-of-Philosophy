    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art || Art, Beauty, and Propaganda\n5.2 Art, Beauty, and Propaganda\n\nDu Bois\u2019s essay, \u201cCriteria of Negro Art\u201d (1925), is\nhis most important contribution to the philosophy of art. The essay is\nDu Bois\u2019s clearest statement of his disagreement with the\nphilosopher and Dean of the Harlem Renaissance, Alain Locke, about the\nrelation between art and propaganda. Against Locke\u2019s view that\ngenius and talent \u201cmust choose art and put aside\npropaganda,\u201d Du Bois held \u201cthat all art is propaganda and\never must be\u201d (Locke, 1928, par. 1; Du Bois, 1926, par. 29). At\nissue in Du Bois\u2019s \u201cgreat debate\u201d with Locke is the\nrole of the arts \u201cin creating respect for a people suffering\nfrom humiliation and self-loathing\u201d (Harris, 15).\n\nDu Bois claims that artists rely on beauty to communicate truth and\ngoodness (in all its aspects of justice, honor, and right)\u2014in\nthe first case to promote universal understanding, and in the second\nto gain sympathy and human interest. The \u201capostle of\nBeauty,\u201d he writes, \u201cthus becomes the apostle of truth and\nright not by choice but by inner and outer compulsion. Free he is, but\nhis freedom is ever bounded by Truth and Justice\u201d (par. 28).\n\nConsidering these claims in the perspective of Du Bois\u2019s\nexpressivism, Taylor plausibly interprets Du Bois as arguing that,\nbecause artists \u201care dialectically enmeshed in wider webs of\nmeaning concerning the true and the just, and must create themselves\nas individuals by working out their orientation to these\nnetworks,\u201d all art is propaganda. On this account, no work of\nart can reasonably claim to derive its content from \u201ca distinct\nand inviolate domain of aesthetic value,\u201d for all art derives\nits content from a public domain of ethico-political value to which\nthe artist must creatively respond. The artist is at once outwardly\nand inwardly compelled by the webs of meaning that encumber her, for\nwhile these webs of meaning impose themselves from\n\u201cwithout,\u201d the artist suffers them as parameters\nconstituting her \u201cwithin\u201d as a subject. The freedom that\nthe apostle of truth and right can claim in relation to these\nparameters is akin to self-legislation\u2014it is the freedom she\nenjoys in creatively responding to them, in working out her\nrelationship to them and, in effect, making them her own (Taylor,\n2016, 96\u201399).\n\nBy exercising her freedom, finally, by creating beautiful works of art\nthat promote the ends of sympathy and universal understanding, the\nartist may undertake to widen the ethical and cognitive horizons of\nher intended addressees, and thus to expand their capacity for\njudgment. In writing a book like Souls, for example, Du Bois\nundertook to widen his white counterparts\u2019 capacities to\nsympathize with and evaluate the suffering in the souls of black\nAmericans (Rogers, 2012, 193\u2013198).\n\nWhat is the nature of beauty such that it can achieve these ends\nthrough the communication of truth and goodness? Du Bois never states\na clear answer to this\n question.[42]\n But he offers clues to an answer in \u201cOf Beauty and\nDeath,\u201d chapter 9 of Darkwater. In that essay, his most\nsustained reflection on the nature of beauty, Du Bois contrasts beauty\nto \u201cugliness and hate and ill\u2026with all their\ncontradiction and illogic;\u201d beauty, he writes, \u201cis\nfulfillment. It satisfies. It is always new and strange. It is the\nreasonable thing\u201d (1920, 120). Perhaps Du Bois\u2019s point is\nan expressivist one: that beauty satisfies by clarifying our ideas of\ntruth (at once consistent and reasonable) and goodness (the opposite\nof hate and ill); that is, by embodying those ideas in novel and\nunsettling works of art (for further reflection on Du Bois\u2019s\naesthetics, see Valdez, 2019, chapter 3 and Gooding-Williams, 2021 and\n2023).\n",
