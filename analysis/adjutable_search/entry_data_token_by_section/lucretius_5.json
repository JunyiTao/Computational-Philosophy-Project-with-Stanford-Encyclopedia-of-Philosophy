    "main_text": "Ethics\n6. Ethics\n\nThe DRN\u2019s opening, perhaps channeling Empedocles,\nproposes religion, or rather wrong religion, as the obstacle to human\nhappiness, for which the cure is physics. Yet as the work progresses\nLucretius provides a richer picture of Epicurean ethics, including\nEpicurean hedonism, and outlines a wider range of obstacles to human\nhappiness. Lucretius does not give a full presentation of Epicurean\nethics, though the end of Book 3 on death comes close, but the proems\noffer brief sermons or strenuous pleas for Epicurean values mixed with\npointed diagnoses of contemporary malaises. Thanks to these, by the\nend of the 6 books, Lucretius manages a reasonably full picture of\nEpicurean ethics and its goal of peace of mind, the capacity to\n\u2018face all things with a calm mind\u2019 placata\nposse omnia mente tueri (5.1203).\n\nThe proem of book 1 opens with a hymn to Venus as world-governing\ndeity (1.21) and a prayer for her to intervene with Mars, god of war\n(1.29\u201344), both of which are problematic for Epicurean theology\n(see section 7). But the hymn also celebrates the generative and\nattractive side of nature, Venus as \u2018pleasure of gods and\nmen\u2019 hominum divomque voluptas (1.1). The\nproem of Book 2 (1\u201361) also opens with pleasure\n(iucunda voluptas 2.4), but a more refined\npsychological pleasure, that of knowing you have escaped ills and are\nabove the fray in the \u2018lofty sanctuaries of the wise\u2019\n(2.7). Lucretius follows this with the normative claim that nature\ncalls for nothing else than freedom from pain and a mind at\npeace. Other apparent goods such as luxury, social status or glory do\nnot profit the body or the mind. None of these, moreover, can dispatch\nthe fear of death; only reason or philosophy can do that. The opening\nof book 3 concentrates upon the praise of Epicurus, whose teachings\ndispel all fear, so that in contemplating nature, as revealed by him,\nwe seem to leave the world behind us, to experience divine pleasure\nand awe divina voluptas\u2026 atque horror\n(3.1\u201330).\n\nThe conclusion of book 3 (830\u20131094), following the demonstration\nof the mortality of body and soul, seeks to remove the fear of death.\nDeath according to Epicurus is the end of all sensation, it is\n\u2018nothing to us\u2019 (830). To fear being dead\n\u2013as opposed to dying\u2013 is to suffer from a conceptual\nmuddle. The hard fact is that you will not be at your own\nburial, nor will you be nibbled by worms in the ground or\nsuffer torments or rewards in the afterlife, because you will\nno longer exist. In what has become known as the symmetry argument\n(Warren 2004), Lucretius argues that, just as we calmly accept our\nnon-existence before life, we should view the time after it with the\nsame indifference. This therapeutic mix of emotion and argument is\nonly one of many in the close of book 3, which combines philosophical\nargument with rhetorical and poetic techniques to great effect.\n\nNot as magnificent, but more appropriately comic is the attack on\nerotic love concluding book 4 (1058\u20131287). Lucretius demotes\ncosmic Venus from the proem of 1 to human sexual desire and dismisses\nerotic passion as simply an excessive form of a natural desire.\nLucretius\u2019 attitude seems less philosophical than middle-aged or\nmedical, with emphasis on practical sexual education. We are informed\nthat women also have a libido, what positions are best for conception,\nand that devotion and clean habits are the basis of stable\nattachment.\n\nThe proems of 5 and 6 concentrate more directly on Epicurus. The proem\nof 6 (1\u201395, especially 10\u201333) contains the most explicit\nsummary of Epicurus\u2019s moral benefactions in the poem. Building\non the account of civilisation from book 5, it places Epicurus in\nhistorical Athens, and explains how, despite having every material\nneed satisfied, the Athenians were still unable to achieve peace of\nmind. For this they needed Epicurus to teach them the limits of fear\nand pleasure and a scientific understanding of the world (31\u20132).\nThe function of the last, as Lucretius expands in managing the\ntransition to the meteorological subject of the book, was to banish\nfear of the divine (50\u201367), which was particularly linked to the\nheavens in the imagination and liable to insinuate itself into our\nthinking through ignorance of the workings of nature (see section\n7).\n\nThe gruesome depiction of the Athenian plague concludes the poem\n(6.1138\u20131286). As noted, its focus on death and suffering\ncorresponds to the poem\u2019s opening scene with Venus and birth.\nEpicurus taught that suffering could be resisted through mental\nfocusing on the joys one had already experienced, while extreme pain\ncould be endured through the knowledge that it would be short-lived\n(Key doctrines 3 and 4). Though moderns tend to find this\nless than convincing, Epicurus put it into to practice for the benefit\nof his disciples in recording how he coped successfully with the\npainful circumstances of his own death (Diogenes Laertius\n10.22). In the later summing-up formula of Epicurean ethics, such\ncheerful endurance was the final ingredient in the \u2018fourfold\nremedy\u2019 for happiness: \u2018God holds no fear, death no\nworries; the good is easy to get; evil easily endured\u2019\n(Philodemus, Against the Those who Claim to be Readers,\nPHerc 1005, 4.9\u201314). Although Lucretius dwells on the\nhelpless mental anguish of the Athenian plague victims, he does not\noffer an explicit Epicurean remedy. Some hold that the ending we have,\nwhich merely depicts the ailment and not the cure, is the one\nLucretius intended because, thanks to all we have learnt, we can\nsupply it ourselves. For others, the ending still awaits its final\nrevision, because it is hard to imagine that Lucretius, having dealt\nwith the first three explicitly in the poem, would have left the\nfourth merely implicit.\n",
