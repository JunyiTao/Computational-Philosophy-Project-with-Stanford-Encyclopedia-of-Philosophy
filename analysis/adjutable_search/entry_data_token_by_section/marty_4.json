    "main_text": "Language || Descriptive Semasiology\n3.2 Descriptive Semasiology\n\nIn the nineteenth century the term \u201csemasiology\u201d\n(Semasiologie) was often used in reference to linguistic\ninvestigations concerning meaning. Marty often uses this term in order\nto designate his philosophical investigations concerning language\nwhich are indeed by and large concerned with meaning. Other terms\nwhich are used by him more or less synonymously are\n\u201csemantics\u201d (Semantik) and \u201cuniversal\ngrammar\u201d (allgemeine Grammatik), especially in\nreference to his synchronic undertaking. Among Marty\u2019s\ncontemporaries Husserl spoke of \u201cpure grammar\u201d (reine\nGrammatik), which was, however, conceived of as part of formal\nlogic (Husserl 1901, 286\u2013321). Insofar as Marty\u2019s\nuniversal grammar is a semasiology developed in the framework of\nBrentanian descriptive psychology and with a look to universal forms\nunderlying communicative intention, Marty thinks that his endeavor is\nquite distinct from \u2013 and of greater philosophical significance\nthan \u2013 Husserl\u2019s foray into the grammatical domain which\nattempts to single out and describe pure logical grammar a\npriori and in abstraction from the communicative function of\nlanguage (Husserl 1901, Marty 1908a, 56\u201363, Seron 2017,\n309\u2013324, Leblanc 2017, 325\u2013344).\n\nA crucial distinction in Marty\u2019s descriptive semasiology is that\nbetween those expressions which have meaning independently and those\nwhich do not (Marty 1908a, 205 ff.). He calls the former\n\u201cautosemantic expressions\u201d (autosemantische\nAusdr\u00fccke) or simply \u201cautosemantica\u201d\n(Autosemantika), as exemplified by names and sentences of\nvarious kinds, whereas he calls the latter \u201csynsemantic\nexpressions\u201d (synsemantische Ausdr\u00fccke) or simply\n\u201csynsemantica\u201d (Synsemantika), as exemplified by\nparticles (\u201cand\u201d, \u201cif\u201d, etc.) as well as\ninflected nouns and verbs.\n\nIt is also of importance here to understand Marty\u2019s concept of\ninner linguistic form. This concept had been introduced by Wilhelm von\nHumboldt in order to designate the total worldview\n(Weltanschauung) of a people who speaks the language in\nquestion and even tied with the notion of the spirit of a people\n(Volksgeist), but also with imagery that occurs in the usage\nof a language. While such notions as worldview and the spirit of a\npeople play no role in Marty\u2019s descriptive semasiology, he still\nfinds it appropriate to designate the inner linguistic form (or\n\u201cetymon\u201d), understood as \u201ca presentation which\nserves as a link of association between the outwardly perceivable sign\nand its meaning\u201d (Marty 1884: 298), whether it be autosemantic\nor synsemantic. Outstanding examples of inner linguistic form are\nprovided by the ideas behind various figurative expressions which are\nbuilt into a language, e.g. \u201cto give hand\u201d and \u201cto\nsweep an opinion aside\u201d. Here images are called to mind, as can\nreadily be confirmed by inner perception, and are useful in making us\nunderstand what is meant, without resorting to more complex\nexpressions. In his later work Marty differentiated the figurative\ninner form of expression, as this has just been indicated, from the\nconstructive inner form (Marty 1908, 144\u2013150). Since our\nunderstanding of utterances in communication is a gradual process,\nouter expression of uncompleted utterances bring about certain\naccessory presentations which build expectation with regard to the\nwhole meaning of the not yet finished utterances. Different languages,\nor, for example, different rhetorical styles and artistic means of\nexpression use different typical forms of preparatory constructions of\nmeanings. These preparatory presentations (inner constructive forms)\nbound with outer forms of partial expressions cannot be equated with\nthe meaning of the utterance which appertains only to the whole\nexpression once its utterance is finished. Though Marty was by no\nmeans unique among the linguists and philosophers of language after\nvon Humboldt in making use of such a concept, he was also critical of\nmany of his contemporaries, especially the nativists, who were, on his\nview, conflating the inner linguistic forms of expressions and their\nmeanings. Such a conflation, he maintains, was already made by von\nHumboldt, for the worldview of a people who speaks a given language is\nmore accurately identified with the meanings conveyed by applications\nof language and not with images or other inner forms which link these\nexpressions with the meanings. Moreover, Marty finds some of his\ncontemporaries, such as Berthold Delbr\u00fcck, to be involved in a\nconfusion between inner and outer linguistic form (i.e. the\nperceivable part of linguistic sign). This last point is also related\nto Marty\u2019s efforts to argue that there is a distinction between\na linguistic expression and its meaning. As obvious as this may be at\npresent, some of Marty\u2019s contemporaries wished to identify the\ntwo \u2013 perhaps as an after-effect of Schelling\u2019s\n\u201cidentity philosophy\u201d which Brentano had already laid to\nrest in W\u00fcrzburg. Accordingly Marty\u2019s semasiology is\nconcerned with the complex unity (not identity) of\n\u201clinguistic expression \u2013 inner linguistic form \u2013\nmeaning\u201d.\n\nAs already noted, Marty\u2019s approach to language differs from that\nof many others insofar as he makes the notion of intentionality\ncentral in his investigations. In his earlier work he followed\nBrentano in adopting an immanentist version of this notion. That is to\nsay, for the early Marty the thesis that every mental phenomenon\nintentionally refers to an object is equivalent to saying that there\nis an object (content) immanent to every phenomenon of mind. In his\nletter to Husserl (reprinted in Schuhmann 1994, 71\u201374, English\ntranslation in Mulligan 1990, 228\u2013232), Marty points out the\nproblem of non-existing objects as the main motivation of this theory.\nIntention, as any proper relation, requires the existence of its\nterms. If an intention exists, its intentional object must exist as\nwell. However, the actual object of the intentional presenting does\nnot always exist. Therefore the actually non-existing presented object\ndoes not exist really but only intentionally and immanently\n\u201cin\u201d the presentation. While the transcendent object of\npresentation sometimes exist and sometimes does not, the immanent\nobject (or immanent content as it was also called) of presentation\nalways exists. Furthermore, judgments and phenomena of love and hate\nhave their own immanent contents \u2013 the judged as such (the being\nor non-being of the presented object) and the loved and hated as such\n(the positive or negative value of the presented object). Marty was of\nconsequently critical of other philosophers, such as William James (in\nconnection with the thesis that an idea never occurs twice in\nconsciousness, as stated in James 1890, especially Chapter XII), for\nfailing to distinguish between the object immanent to an act of\nconsciousness and the real object allegedly external to consciousness\n(Marty 1916a, 139 ff.). As the immanentist understanding of\nintentionality was eventually abandoned by Brentano and other students\nof his (see for example posthumously published collection of\nBrentano\u2019s texts, Brentano 1966), Marty is no exception in this\nregard. In his main work he accordingly attempted another formulation\nof the notion of intentionality. The consciousness of an object is\ntaken by Marty to be a similarity (\u00c4hnlichkeit),\n\u201csimilarizing\u201d (Ver\u00e4hnlichung), likeness\n(Gleichheit), conformity (Konformit\u00e4t), or\nadequation (Ad\u00e4quation) between the mental act and its\nobject, though he stresses that this similarity (to use one of his\nterms) is purely mind-dependent (ideell) and indeed\naltogether unique to these phenomena (Marty 1908a, 333, 406 ff.,\n413\u2013418, 423 ff., 430, 444, 453, 481, 487). As stated, the ideal\nsimilarity or ideal (\u00c4hnlichkeit),\n\u201csimilarizing\u201d appertains to the intentional act, not to\nthe immanent object, for there are no immanent objects. These are now\nviewed by Marty as linguistic fictions suggested by the inner form of\nsuch expressions as \u201cpresented object\u201d, \u201cjudged\nobject\u201d, \u201cloved object\u201d etc. Marty\u2019s\nalternative concept of intentionality as similarity is, without a\ndoubt, one of the most difficult aspects of his descriptive\npsychology. Ideal similarity is for him in no way the same as the\nsimilarity to be found among physical objects (Marty 1908a, 408).\nWhile similarity in the ordinary sense has a negative character and\nallows for degrees of more and less, ideal similarity holding between\nthe act and its object lacks these features (Marty 1908a). However,\nthe fact that ideal and ordinary similarity are both grounded\nrelations and that in both cases we find a relative determination next\nto a correlation (Marty 1908a, 413) makes it possible to use the word\n\u201csimilarity\u201d in an analogical way to characterize\n\u201cintentional directedness\u201d of mental phenomena (for\nfurther explanations see Chrudzimski 2001, Cesalli & Taieb 2013,\nCesalli 2017b, Majolino 2017). It should be noted that correlation of\nthe act and its object is now formulated by Marty in counterfactual\nterms: if the object of the mental act existed, it would necessarily\nbe the correlate of that act. Therefore the intentional being of the\nin-existing immanent object is not required for the act to count as\nintentional. Marty is very critical of philosophers who make\nintentionality central in their treatment of mind and yet fail to take\ninto account mind-dependent likeness. Such a philosopher, according to\nMarty, is Husserl, who allegedly construes intentionality in terms of\nthe relation of sign to signified object and thereby falls into an\nunacceptable semanticism (Semantizismus) (Marty 1908a, 762;\nfor a discussion of Marty and Husserl, see Rollinger 1999,\n209\u2013244). It is, however, fortunate that a good deal of what he\nsays of mind and language does not require an understanding of this\nconcept.\n\nIt is difficult to state Marty\u2019s theory of meaning for two\nreasons. First of all, he speaks of meaning in at least two different\nsenses. In the \u201cnarrower\u201d sense, Marty regards the\ncontents of mental acts as the meaning of an expression. In the second\nsense, which might be called the meaning in the wider sense (Marty\n1908a, 291\u2013292), he also considers the meaning of an expression\nto be its communicative function. In this wider sense the meaning of a\nstatement, for instance, is not merely something contained in the\nconsciousness of the speaker who makes the statement or even some sort\nof entity that exists outside of his or her consciousness. The meaning\nof the statement can rather only be formulated by saying that the\ninterlocutor intends to evoke a like judgment on the side of the\nhearer \u2013 what he or she judges should be accepted. This is the\nso called primary communicative intention of the speaker. Moreover, by\nuttering a statement the speaker secondarily manifests that he or she\njudges that such and such is the case. This manifestation of the act\nof judging is the so called secondary communicative intention of the\nspeaker, which serves as means for attaining the primary goal (Marty\n1908a, 284n.; Cesalli & Mulligan 2017, 260; Janou\u0161ek 2017,\n243). Here, however, we confront the second reason why it is difficult\nto shortly state Marty\u2019s theory of meaning in general terms. The\nprimary communicative function of an expression will vary according to\nthe type of expression in question. It is thus indispensable to\nelaborate on meaning as communicative function by examining its\nvariety. This will be done here with respect to the autosemantica, as\nindeed Marty does at length in his main work.\n\nIt is in the classification of autosemantica where Brentanian\ndescriptive psychology especially comes into play in Marty\u2019s\ndescriptive semasiology. While Brentano had maintained that every act\nof the mind belongs to one of three classes, namely presentations,\njudgments, and acts of love and hate, Marty says that autosemantica\nlikewise fall into three classes, namely names\n(Vorstellungssuggestive), statements (Aussagen) and\nexpressions of interest (Emotive), each one corresponding to\na class of mental phenomena. In the elaboration of his view he opposes\nthree alternative views concerning the division of such phenomena held\nby certain predecessors and contemporaries: 1) the prevailing view of\nthe nineteenth century in the German speaking world, namely that the\nphenomena of mind are to be divided into thinking, feeling, and\nwilling, 2) the view attributed to Herbart as well as other\nphilosophers, namely that the mind consists only of presentations (or,\nas one might also say, ideas), and 3) the view of Meinong and his\nfollowers in the Graz school, that there is a class of mental\nphenomena, called \u201cassumptions\u201d (Annahmen), which\nlies \u201cbetween\u201d presentations and judgments (see Meinong\n1902, Marty 1905, Meinong 1906, Meinong 1910). We will begin with a\nbrief discussion of Marty\u2019s treatment of statements, then we\nwill briefly address emotives and conclude with names.\n\nStatements (Aussagen) make up the autosemantica which express\njudgments. This class of expressions received considerable attention\nfrom Marty in his early work (Marty 1884), especially with regard to\nthe problem of statements which apparently have no subject, so-called\n\u201cimpersonals\u201d (Impersonalien). While statements\nof this kind were a grave embarrassment to the traditional conception\nof judgment as predication, Marty argued at length, in opposition to\nthe views of many philosophers, psychologists, and linguists, that the\nimpersonals are best understood as expressing judgments in which\nsomething is accepted or rejected or, as one may alternatively\nformulate his view, regarded as existent or non-existent. If, for\ninstance, the impersonal \u201cIt is raining\u201d is under\nconsideration, there is no need to theorize about a mysterious entity\nto which \u201cit\u201d refers, for this statement only expresses\nthe judgment that there exists the event of raining within the\nspeakers vicinity. Such an approach to impersonals had already been\nadvanced by a specialist in the Slavic languages (Miklosich 1883; cf.\nBrentano 1889: 109\u2013133). Marty cites this philological work with\napproval, but it is clear that the main inspiration behind his\napproach is Brentano.\n\nIn his attempt to defend the Brentanian theory of judgment in the\nlinguistic domain Marty makes an effort to reformulate various\nstatements in order to show that they are actually instances of\naccepting or rejecting. As Brentano maintained that the judgments in\nthe traditional square of opposition are to be exhibited by construing\nthe universal ones as negative (\u201cEvery A is\nB\u201d = \u201cThere is no A which is not\nB\u201d, \u201cNo A is B\u201d =\n\u201cThere is no A which is B\u201d) and the\nparticular ones as affirmative (\u201cSome A is\nB\u201d = \u201cThere is an A which is\nB\u201d, \u201cSome A is not B\u201d =\n\u201cThere is an A which is not B\u201d), Marty\nfinds such reformulations acceptable. Moreover, he identifies a class\nof judgments such as \u201cThis tree is green\u201d or \u201cThis\ntree is not green\u201d as double judgments (Doppelurteile),\nwhich is again a notion he explicitly takes from Brentano (Marty 1897:\n179 ff.). What is peculiar about double judgments is that the subject\nterm, e.g. \u201cthis tree\u201d, already expresses an instance of\nacceptance (the tree is) and there is another affirmation or rejection\n(Zuerkennen, Aberkennen) of \u201cBeing-so\u201d expressed\nby the grammar form of a predicate, e.g. \u201cis green\u201d, built\nupon this acceptance. The double judgment then, according to Marty,\ncould be formulated as having the form \u201c the green-being of the\n[already existentially affirmed] tree is\u201d for the predicative\naffirmation and \u201c the green-being of the [already existentially\naffirmed] tree is not\u201d for the predicative negation (Marty 1895,\n263f., see also Chrudzimski 2009). It follows that for Marty all\npredication of \u201cBeing-so\u201d involves existential affirmation\nof the subject. While the statements which belong to the four classes\nidentified in the traditional square of opposition are regarded as\n\u201cpseudo-categorical\u201d (i.e. having the appearance of being\npredicative without actually being so) because they are better\nexpressed in the existential form rather than the predicative one,\ndouble judgments on Marty\u2019s view are to be considered\ncategorical because they cannot be properly expressed without the\nsubject-predicate grammar form. Moreover, he also identifies certain\nstatements as \u201ccategoroid\u201d, namely those disjunctive and\nhypothetical statements which do not express double judgments.\nMarty\u2019s attempt to regard these as instances of acceptance and\nrejection, which can ultimately be reformulated existentially,\ninvolves him in some rather intricate considerations.\n\nWhile Marty ascribes to statements the communicative function (and\nthus in one, normatively viewed, sense the meaning) \u201cthat one\nshould judge as the speaker does\u201d, he points out that a demand\non the interlocutor\u2019s will is not thereby made as it is in the\ncase of certain other linguistic expressions, e.g. commands. A\nstatement is, by contrast to these, only \u201ca suggestive of\njudging\u201d (ein Suggestiv zum Urteilen) (Marty\n1908a 288). Moreover, there are certain aspects of the judgment which\ncannot be communicated in a statement, namely whether the judgment is\nevident or blind and whether it is apodictic or assertoric (Marty\n1908a 289 ff.). As Marty further elaborates, he says:\n\nIn a narrower sense, however, we call \u2026 something in addition\nthe meaning of a statement. Whoever states, \u201cA\nis\u201d, provided that he himself judges so, treats A as an\nentity and asks of the interlocutor as well that he, with trust in\nthis externalized conduct of the speaker, should treat A as\nan entity. In this regard we say also that the statement makes known\nthe being of A and aims at making it known or believes that\nit is doing so and means it in this sense. And since we often\nalso designate the being of A or that A is, also\nA\u2018s being-B or that A is B,\nas the content of the judgment \u201cA is\u201d or\n\u201cA is B\u201d and again designate the\nnon-being of A and A\u2018s not-being-B as\nthe content of the judgment \u201cA is not\u201d or\n\u201cA is not B\u201d, we can also say: the\nstatement makes known the content of judgment and means it in\nthis sense. (Marty 1908a: 292)\n\n\nWhen Marty speaks of the meaning of a statement as the content of the\njudgment which is thereby expressed, he is well aware of opening the\npossibility of comparisons with similar concepts in the work of\nvarious philosophers, e.g. the proposition in itself (Satz an\nsich) (Bolzano), the state of affairs (Sachverhalt)\n(Stumpf and Husserl), and the objective (Objektiv) (Meinong).\nAccordingly he faces the same difficulty that these others also had to\nface, i.e. determining the ontological status of such a thing (or\nnon-thing). It is Marty\u2019s view that contents of judgment exist\nin the sense that it is correct to accept them and are furthermore\nnon-real. What it means to be real for the mature Marty is to be\ninvolved in a causal nexus. (On his earlier view, real was whatever\ncould be subsumed under the Aristotelian categories.) While he regards\nphysical and mental things or events as real, he maintains that\ncontents of judgment, i.e. the meanings of statements \u201cin the\nnarrower sense\u201d, have only a co-becoming (Mitwerden),\nwhich does not allow them to be characterized as real. Thus, in\nworking out a descriptive semasiology of statements Marty puts forward\na very important ontological thesis.\n\nThe ontological thesis that there are in addition to real objects also\nnon-real ones such as contents of judgment was for Marty an important\ndeparture from Brentanian doctrine. Though Brentano and the early\nMarty had allowed for irrealia strictly as objects immanent\nto consciousness, Brentano came to reject this theory in favor of\nsaying that the non-real consists only of linguistic fictions. Marty\nhimself came to have misgivings about the notion of immanent objects\nand his term \u201ccontent of judgment\u201d in his main work must\nnot be taken as an indication of something that actually or\n\u201cintentionally\u201d exists in consciousness. However, Marty,\nwho never accepted Brentano\u2019s explanation of truth in terms of\nevidence, kept the mind-independent contents of judgments to ground\nhis theory of the correctness or objectivity of judgments. A judgment\nis correct when it is ideally adequate to the judgment content, that\nis to the state of affairs (Marty 1916, 155\u2013156, see also Smith\n1995, Chrudzimski 2014, Cesalli & Mulligan, 2017). When we\napprehend judgment as being evident we co-apprehend its ideal adequacy\nwith the content judgment Marty 1908, 314), or in other words, in\nevidence correctness of judgments manifests itself (Marty 1916, 157).\nIt should be noted that Marty\u2019s contents of judgment must not be\nconstrued as ideal universal objects, such as meanings according to\nHusserl\u2019s view in the Logical Investigations. While\nHusserl maintains that meanings are species (of meaning-giving acts or\nof certain parts of such acts) and are as such timeless (Husserl 1901:\n23\u2013105), Marty ascribes to them a co-becoming which of course\ninvolves temporality and certainly does not characterize them as\nself-subsisting species, but rather as founded or supervenient\nentities. Contents of judgment and other non-real entities, as Marty\nunderstands them, do not include universals of any kind, whether these\nbe genera or species. In short, Husserl\u2019s view on such matters\nis closer to some sort of Platonism than Marty\u2019s is. There\nremains a very definite alliance with Aristotle in Marty\u2019s\nontology (Marty 1908a, 337 f.).\n\nAs Marty regards statements as autosemantica which manifest judgments\nand communicate to the interlocutor that he or she is to judge in the\nsame way, he characterizes emotives or interest-demanding expressions\n(interesseheischende Ausdr\u00fccke) as those autosemantic\nwhich manifest not only emotions, but also volitions (which for him\nand Brentano belong to one and the same class), and communicate to the\ninterlocutor that he or she is to feel or will in the same way. The\nanalogy between statements and judgments is upheld by Marty to great\nlengths.\n\nIn view of this analogy the following passage is of particular\ninterest:\n\nIs an analogue of the judgment-content really missing in the realm of\ninterest? I don\u2019t believe it is. To be sure, a thoroughly\nsubjectivistic and in this sense erroneously\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d view is very widespread, which does not\naccept the distinction between what is merely loveable as a matter of\nfact and what is worthy of love and between a blind compulsion and an\n\u201cought\u201d in the sense of a norm of correctness in this\nrealm. However, even though it calls itself \u201cvalue\ntheory\u201d, it is still unable to give a satisfactory account of\nthe concept of value and disvalue just as the analogous psychologistic\ndoctrine in the realm of epistemology is unable to give such an\naccount of the concept of the true and the false. Only if value and\ndisvalue are truly analogues of the true and the false \u2026 can\nthere also be in the realm of interest an analogue of correctness and\nincorrectness, and both are possible only if there is something\nindependent of the subjective phenomenon of loving and hating and in\nthis sense objective that establishes that correctness of mental\nconduct, just as the being of the object is the objective foundation\nfor the correctness of the acceptance thereof, its non-being for the\nrejection thereof. Without such a firm basis and standard all talk of\nvalue and disvalue, good and evil, and also of what is in accordance\nwith duty and what is against it, etc. would be without natural\njustification and sanction (Marty 1908, 370).\n\n\nThus we see that in his descriptive semasiology of emotives Marty puts\nforward a very important axiological thesis. Certain acts of love and\nhate can be correct as well. This correctness manifests itself in\nevident acts of love and hate and consists in their ideal adequacy to\nthe value and disvalue of the object, or a state of values\n(Wertverhalt) as Marty sometimes calls these contents. The\nmention of epistemology in the passage quoted should also not go\nunnoticed. There is accordingly a very strong sense in which\nMarty\u2019s descriptive semasiology involves a very forcefully\nstated anti-psychologism in all domains of philosophy. The price of\nthis anti-psychologism, however, is an ontology that allows for\nnon-real entities, whether they be the objective correlates of\njudgments or interest.\n\nThe final class of autosemantica for Marty consists of names and other\nexpressions which serve to express presentations. He calls these\n\u201cpresentational suggestives\u201d\n(Vorstellungssuggestive) and devotes a very extensive chapter\nof his main work to the treatment of them. (See Marty 1908,\n383\u2013489). He ascribes to these a communicative function just as\nhe did to the other autosemantica. \u201cAs the direct purpose of a\nstatement is to evoke in the interlocutor a certain judgment\u201d,\nsays Marty, \u201ca presentational suggestive also and especially a\nname primarily in its proper usage aims at awakening in him a certain\npresentation, and as that primary intention is ultimately designated\nas the meaning of a statement, the analogue is called the meaning of\nthe name\u201d (Marty 1908a, 384 f.). The autosemantica which have\nsuch function (meaning in the wider sense) and are everywhere\nacknowledged as being able to stand as subjects in a predicative\nconnection are called \u201cnames\u201d, as exemplified by \u201ca\ntriangle\u201d, \u201ca rectangle\u201d, \u201can equilateral\ntriangle\u201d, \u201ca human being who has committed a\ncrime\u201d, \u201csomething red\u201d, \u201csomething\nround\u201d, \u201ca red thing that is round\u201d, and also\ninfinitives such as \u201cto get up early\u201d and \u201cto have\none\u2019s hands full\u201d. As regards the presentational\nsuggestives which are not names, Marty points out the usage of\nlanguage in poetry and fiction (Marty 1908, 474 ff.). While the\nsentences used in such instances may resemble statements, for the most\npart they have the function of expressing and evoking presentations\nand are not actually statements. However, these whole sentences are\npeculiar insofar as the relevant presentations have contents of\njudgment as their objects. Such presentations of contents of judgment\nare on Marty\u2019s view the acts of consciousness which Meinong\nerroneously identified as assumptions (Marty 1905).\n\nWhile it is thus possible to present contents of judgment and\npresentational suggestives also have a communicative function that is\nanalogous to that of statements and emotives, the question arises as\nto whether there are also contents (i.e. special objects) of\npresentation analogous to the contents (states of affairs, states of\nvalues) in the other two cases of mental acts. In this regard Marty\nundertakes to criticize his older view that there are indeed such\ncontents under the heading of \u201cimmanent objects\u201d (Marty\n1908a 384\u2013406). He no longer holds this view in his later\nwritings and also rejects the notion of a thorough-going analogy\nbetween presentations and mental acts of the other two classes. As\nregards the old thesis that consciousness is always the consciousness\nof something, he endeavors to preserve this by appealing to the\nalready mentioned notion of mind-dependent conformity to an object,\nwhich may be either actually or potentially named by the\npresentational suggestive (Marty 1908a 407\u2013431). Thus Marty\ndiffers the meaning (Bedeutung) in the sense of the\nconceptual presentation to be evoked and the reference of names\n(das Gennante). He further offers interesting discussions of\nthe differences concerning reference of general and singular names\n(definite descriptions and proper names). General names refer via\ntheir conceptual presentative content (mediantibus conceptibus \u2013\nMarty 1908, 436) to indefinitely many objects of the extension fixed\nby the conceptual presentation. Singular descriptions are for Marty\nnames which name via their complex conceptual concept definitely, but\nessentially incompletely, since a concept, however complex it is, can\nnever \u201cexhaust\u201d the individuality of the object. Therefore\nvarious complex concepts can be used for one individual \u2013\n\u201cfor example, teacher of Alexander the Great and founder of the\nperipatetic School for Aristotle\u201d (Marty 1908, 438). Proper\nnames refer definitely, but they leave completely undecided what\nobjects is to be named by them and even what individual presentation\nis to be evoked by their use (Marty 1908, 439). The reference is fixed\nin the context of their introduction and the individual presentation\nevoked by the name can never be considered as the meaning of the\nproper name (Landgrebe 1934, 83\u201390, Gabriel 1990). Finally, it\nis also noteworthy that the autosemantic character of names does not\nstand on an equal footing with the autosemantic character of fictive\nstatements, actual statements and emotives. To form an actual or\nfictive (merely presented) speech, which both are for Marty practical\nautosemantic expressions (praktische Autosemantica), we never\nuse names in isolation. However even when used in isolation, names\nstill have a certain kind of complete meaning in contrast to, for\ninstance, mere particles or flexed substantives \u2013 due to this\ncompleteness Marty views names as theoretical autosemantic expressions\n(theoretische Autosemantica). (Marty 1908, 476\u2013477,\nFunke 1924, 23) Moreover, he continues to uphold the thesis, as\nalready found in Brentano\u2019s work, that all mental acts which are\nnot themselves presentations are founded on presentations (Marty\n1908a: 479\u2013489).\n",
