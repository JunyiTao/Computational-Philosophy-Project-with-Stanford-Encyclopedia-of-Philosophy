    "main_text": "Early Philosophy\n2. Early Philosophy\n\n The basis of Rehberg's critique of the Revolution was his early\nphilosophical views, which he developed from the late 1770s to the\nearly 1790s.  It has been a mistake of traditional scholarship on\nRehberg that it attempts to compartimentalize his thought, separating\nhis philosophical and political\n thinking.[18]\n No one would\nhave been more astonished by such an artificial separation than\nRehberg himself, who, in his retrospective account of his writings in\nthe introduction to his S\u00e4mmtliche Schriften, stressed the\ncentrality of his general philosophical principles.  Apart from their\nimportance for his politics, Rehberg's early philosophical views\ndeserve attention in their own right.  Rehberg staked out a unique and\noriginal position amid the controversies of his age.  \n\n Like so many intellectuals who came of age in the 1780s, the young\nRehberg's intellectual landscape was formed by the pantheism\ncontroversy.  This controversy began in 1785 when Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi proclaimed in his Briefe \u00fcber die Lehre von Spinoza\nto a stunned public that Lessing had been a Spinozist.  Jacobi used\nthis juicy bit of gossip to make a provocative philosophical point:\nthat all rational enquiry, of which Lessing was such a eminent\nexemplar, ends in the atheism and fatalism of Spinozism.  The only way\nto save oneself from such atheism and fatalism, Jacobi suggested, was\nto take a \u201csalto mortale\u201d, a leap of faith\nin a personal God and freedom.  Hence Jacobi presented his\ncontemporaries with a dilemma: either a rational atheism and\na-moralism or an irrational theism and morality.  There could be no\ncomfortable middle path: rational demonstrations of the essential\nbeliefs of morality and religion.  Jacobi's dilemma was a profound\nchallenge to the German Enlightenment or Aufkl\u00e4rung, whose\nultimate article of faith was that there must be some rational\nfoundation for our moral and religious beliefs.  The effect of\nJacobi's book on the German intellectual stage was like \u201ca\nbombshell\u201d.  Within the next year, Kant, Fichte, Herder,\nReinhold and Mendelssohn would write responses to it.  Virtually every\nyoung romantic\u2014Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis, H\u00f6lderlin and\nSchleiermacher\u2014would take a stand in the ensuing debate.\n\n The young Rehberg too was drawn into the vortex of the pantheism\ncontroversy.  Although his skepticism began in the late 1770s, he\nformulated much of his philosophy in response to the issues it raised.\nHis contribution to the controversy were his reviews of Jacobi and\nHerder in the Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung, and his 1787\ntract \u00dcber das Verh\u00e4ltnis der Metaphysik zu der\n Religion.[19]\n In these writings Rehberg continues to\ndevelop his skepticism, which now became his settled position.  In\nthis task he was greatly assisted by his close study of Kant's\ncritical philosophy.  Rehberg agreed with some of Kant's central\ncritical teachings: that pure reason cannot know anything without the\naid of sense experience, and that it is impossible for the senses to\nknow anything beyond appearances.  He found Kant's critique of\ndogmatic metaphysics compelling, and even defended Kant against\nEberhard and the old dogmatic\n Wolffians.[20]\n He rejected,\nhowever, Kant's solution to the pantheism controversy: the concept of\npractical faith, the defense of religious belief on the basis of\npractical reason.  While Rehberg agreed with Kant that the only\njustification of religion is\n practical,[21]\n he could not\naccept that a practical justification has its basis in reason alone.\nThe only practical justification of religion was political: its\nutility in maintaining order among the people.  A more educated man,\nhowever, did not need religious faith to love virtue and do his duty.\nRehberg affirmed an austere stoic ethic, which demanded acting on duty\nalone, regardless of personal happiness.  Like many of his\ncontemporaries, he held that the doctrine of moral faith violated\nKant's own strictures about the autonomy of morals.  The moral law\ndemands acting for the sake of duty alone, regardless of supernatural\nrewards and punishments.  \n\n Throughout the pantheism controversy, Rehberg maintained his\nskeptical attitude toward all religious belief.  Such skepticism was\nunique, his original contribution to the controversy.  All his fellow\ndisputants\u2014 Kant, Herder, Jacobi, Mendelssohn, Goethe, Novalis,\nSchleiermacher, H\u00f6lderlin\u2014affirmed some kind of religion,\nwhether theism or pantheism.  Although Rehberg agreed with Jacobi that\nall metaphysics ends in Spinozism, he did not take this as proof for\npantheism, still less as reason for a salto mortale into\ntheism.  Since he rejected all metaphysics as empty speculation, he\ndid not think that reason obliges us to accept pantheism, let alone\ntheism.  Metaphysics could never justify theism, Rehberg argued,\nbecause it at best establishes that there is a first cause of things,\nbut never that this first cause is a personal being with understanding\nand\n will.[22]\n Although we can attribute understanding and\nwill to God, we have to realize that such attributes are only\nanthropomorphisms that are true for us and never for\n things-in-themselves.[23]\n When his friend J.J. Engel later\nasked him \u201cDo you want to reduce all religion down to\npoetry?\u201d, Rehberg did not demur; his only qualification was that\npoetry sometimes has a moral\n worth.[24]\n\n\n Already in \u00dcber das Verh\u00e4ltnis, published two\nyears before the Revolution, some of Rehberg's conservative views make\na brief appearance.  His skepticism was beginning to bear political\nresults.  It is dangerous, he argues, to assume that reason is the\nbasis for civil administration, because it leads to unwarranted\nexpectations.  The everyday administration of the state often rests on\nad hoc or arbitrary decisions, and it is impossible to expect\nall of them to be based on some rational standard.  Since conflict\nbetween people is inevitable, even in a purely rational constitution\nsome things have to be decided on the basis of force \n alone.[25]\n Rehberg was also convinced of the necessity of elite rule, of the\nneed for someone to make judgements about what is in the best interest\nof everyone.  What is in the best interests of a state is a matter of\nspecialized knowledge, which is not the concern of every\n man.[26]\n\n\n After participating in the pantheism controversy, Rehberg made his\nmark in other philosophical controversies of his day.  In the early\n1790s he wrote several reviews for the Allgemeine Literatur\nZeitung of Karl Leonhard Reinhold's Elementarphilosophie,\nwhich had been at the centre stage of the new debates surrounding\nKant's critical\n philosophy.[27]\n Reinhold's\nElementarphilosophie was a radical form of foundationalism,\nwhose basic aim was to derive all the results of Kant's philosophy\nfrom a single self-evident first principle.  The crucial question for\nReinhold's contemporaries concerned the very possibility of such\nfoundationalism.  Is it possible to found all knowledge upon a single\nfirst principle?  Given Rehberg's skepticism, it should not be\nsurprising that he took a negative stand on this basic question.  In\nhis January 1791 review of Reinhold's Beytr\u00e4ge zur\nBerichtigung bisheriger Missverst\u00e4ndnisse der Philosophen,\nthe chief exposition of the Elementarphilosophie, Rehberg\nsketched his misgivings about foundationalism.  It is striking that\nhis chief objections are strictly Kantian, coming straight out of the\nKritik der reinen Vernunft itself.  Rehberg implies that\nReinhold is guilty of ignoring Kant's own strictures about the limits\nof knowledge; it is as if he were insinuating that Reinhold would\nbetter have heeded Kant's advice to limit himself to popularizing the\ncritical philosophy.  The problem with Reinhold's philosophy, Rehberg\nargues, is that it begins with definitions, ignoring Kant's warnings\nthat definitions should end rather than begin philosophy.  Reinhold\nneglected Kant's teaching that there is a fundamental difference in\nkind between the methods of mathematics and those of philosophy.\nWhile mathematical definitions can construct their objects in\nintuition, philosophical definitions have no such advantages.  What we\nderive from a definition depends on how we interpret it, on what we\nread into it in the first place; and there are all kinds of\ninterpretations of the same definition, so no basis of unanimity\nshould be expected simply by beginning with a definition, no matter\nhow simple and unproblematic.  The chief theme of Rehberg's\nreview\u2014and indeed the leitmotif of all his political\nthought\u2014 is contained in his remark that \u201ca definition need not\ncontain a criterion of that which falls under it\u201d (202).\nRehberg develops this remark so that it becomes an objection against\nany attempt to apply general principles of philosophy to the practical\nworld (205-6).  To apply a general first principle, it is necessary to\nhave a criterion to show the subordinate principles to which it\napplies; but there are no such criteria, because how we apply a\nprinciple is a matter of judgment, which, as Kant demonstrated, has no\n criteria.[28]\n As one might suspect, Rehberg's argument here\nis politically motivated, because he singles out Reinhold as one of\nthose philosophers who think that his first principles are guidelines\nfor the social and political world (204).  The general conclusion of\nRehberg's reasoning could not be more expressly political:\n\u201c...the whole system of education and culture of man that should\nbe based on scientific insight is false in theory and impossible in\nexecution.\u201d (205).\n\n In the rest of his reviews, Rehberg doggedly pursued Reinhold's\nargument throughout the Beytr\u00e4ge, showing precisely\nhow his principles are insufficient to derive even the most basic\nresults of Kant's philosophy.  We cannot begin to reconstruct here the\ndetails of his\n arguments.[29]\n Suffice it to say that\nRehberg's reviews made an impact on his contemporaries, not least\nReinhold himself, who fell into a fit of depression after reading\n them.[30]\n Rehberg's articles had made a great contribution\ntoward skepticism about foundationalism, which would soon have a\nprofound impact on the development of Romanticism.  \n\n The net result of Rehberg's participation in the philosophical\ncontroversies of the late 1780s and early 1790s was a deeper\nskepticism.  There were two basic themes behind his skepticism.\nFirst, his adoption of Kant's critical thesis that we cannot know\nthings-in-themselves, and that all knowledge is limited to\nappearances.  Second, Rehberg's insistence that, even within the realm\nof appearances, there is a fundamental chasm between the universal and\nparticular, between what we think and what we sense.  There were in\nturn two aspects behind this latter dualism: that the universal\nconcepts of theoretical reason cannot sufficiently explain or\ndescribe something particular; and that there is no criterion by which\nto apply the universal principles of practical reason to\nordinary life.  It was this latter aspect of the second theme, which\nwas essentially an argument in behalf of the necessity of judgment to\nsolve the basic problems of politics, that was decisive for Rehberg's\npolitical philosophy. \n",
