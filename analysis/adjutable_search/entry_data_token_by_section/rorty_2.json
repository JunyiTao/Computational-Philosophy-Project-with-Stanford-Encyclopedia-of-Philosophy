    "main_text": "Against Epistemology || Epistemological Behaviorism\n2.1 Epistemological Behaviorism\n\nThat any vocabulary is optional and mutable is the basic conviction\nbehind Rorty\u2019s attack on representationalist epistemology\ncarried out in PMN. It informs, for instance, the genealogy (chapter\none) and deconstruction (chapter two) of the concept of mind offered\nin the book\u2019s first part, \u201cOur Glassy Essence.\u201d This\nhistoricist conviction, however, is not itself a central theme of PMN,\nand it emerges for explicit discussion only in the final section of\nthe book, \u201cPhilosophy,\u201d which is the shortest and in some\nways least developed of its three parts. The argumentative core of PMN\nis found in its second part, \u201cMirroring.\u201d Here Rorty\ndevelops and extends a diverse lot of arguments \u2013 notably from\nWilfrid Sellars, Willard van Orman Quine, Thomas Kuhn, Ludwig\nWittgenstein, and Donald Davidson \u2013 into a general critique of\nthe defining project of modern epistemology, viz., the conceptions of\nmind, of knowledge and of philosophy bequeathed by the 17th\nand 18th centuries. Rorty\u2019s key claim is that\n\u201cthe Kantian picture of concepts and intuitions getting together\nto produce knowledge is needed to give sense to the idea of\n\u2018theory of knowledge\u2019 as a specifically philosophical\ndiscipline, distinct from psychology\u201d (PMN, 168). According to\nRorty,\n\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that if we do not have the distinction\nbetween what is \u201cgiven\u201d and what is \u201cadded by the\nmind,\u201d or that between the \u201ccontingent\u201d (because\ninfluenced by what is given) and the necessary (because entirely\n\u201cwithin\u201d the mind and under its control), then we will not\nknow what would count as a \u201crational reconstruction\u201d of\nour knowledge. We will not know what epistemology\u2019s goal or\nmethod could be. (PMN, 168\u20139)\n\n\nEpistemology, in Rorty\u2019s account, is wedded to a picture of\nmind\u2019s structure working on empirical content to produce in\nitself items \u2013 thoughts, representations \u2013 which, when\nthings go well, correctly mirror reality. To loosen the grip of this\npicture on our thinking is to challenge the idea that epistemology\n\u2013 whether traditional Cartesian or 20th century linguistic\n\u2013 is the essence of philosophy. To this end, Rorty combines a\nreading of Quine\u2019s attack on a version of the structure-content\ndistinction in \u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d (1951) with a\nreading of Sellars\u2019 attack on the idea of givenness in\n\u201cEmpiricism and the Philosophy of Mind\u201d (1956/1997). On\nRorty\u2019s reading, though neither Sellars nor Quine is able fully\nto take in the liberating influence of the other, they are really\nattacking the same distinction, or set of distinctions. While Quine\ncasts doubt on the notion of structure or meaning which\nlinguistically-turned epistemology had instated in place of mental\nentities, Sellars, questioning the very idea of givenness, came at the\ndistinction from the other side:\n\n\n\u2026Sellars and Quine invoke the same argument, one which bears\nequally against the given-versus-nongiven and the\nnecessary-versus-contingent distinctions. The crucial premise of this\nargument is that we understand knowledge when we understand the social\njustification of belief, and thus have no need to view it as accuracy\nof representation. (PMN, 170)\n\n\nThe upshot of Quine\u2019s and Sellars\u2019 criticisms of the myths\nand dogmas of epistemology is, Rorty suggests, that \u201cwe see\nknowledge as a matter of conversation and of social practice, rather\nthan as an attempt to mirror nature\u201d (PMN, 171). Rorty provides\nthis view with a label: \u201cExplaining rationality and epistemic\nauthority by reference to what society lets us say, rather than the\nlatter by the former, is the essence of what I shall call\n\u2018epistemological behaviorism,\u2019 an attitude common to Dewey\nand Wittgenstein\u201d (PMN, 174).\n\nEpistemological behaviorism leaves no room for the kind of\npractice-transcending legitimation that Rorty identifies as the\ndefining aspiration of modern epistemology. Assuming that epistemic\npractices do, or at least can, diverge, it is not surprising that\nRorty\u2019s commitment to epistemological behaviorism should lead to\ncharges of relativism or subjectivism. Indeed, many who share\nRorty\u2019s historicist scepticism toward the transcending ambitions\nof epistemology \u2013 friendly critics like Hilary Putnam, John\nMcDowell and Daniel Dennett \u2013 balk at the idea that there are no\nconstraints on knowledge save conversational ones. Yet this is a\ncentral part of Rorty\u2019s position, repeated and elaborated as\nlate as in TP and PCP. Indeed, in TP he invokes it precisely in order\nto deflect this sort of criticism. In \u201cHilary Putnam and the\nRelativist Menace,\u201d Rorty says:\n\n\nIn short, my strategy for escaping the self-referential difficulties\ninto which \u201cthe Relativist\u201d keeps getting himself is to\nmove everything over from epistemology and metaphysics into cultural\npolitics, from claims to knowledge and appeals to self-evidence to\nsuggestions about what we should try. (TP, 57)\n\n\nThat epistemological behaviorism differs from traditional forms of\nrelativism and subjectivism is easier to see in light of Rorty\u2019s\ncriticism of the notion of representation, and the cluster of\nphilosophical images which surround it.\n",
