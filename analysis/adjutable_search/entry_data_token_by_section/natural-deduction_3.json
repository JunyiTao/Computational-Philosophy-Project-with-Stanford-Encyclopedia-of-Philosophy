    "main_text": "Natural Deduction Systems || Modern Versions of Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s Method\n2.2 Modern Versions of Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s Method\n\nIn our future examples of natural deduction we will employ a more\nmodern version of Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s method: that of Fitch (1952).\nVariants of this method are followed by most modern elementary\ntextbooks, although there is one type of exception that is followed by\nseveral authors. We look at this exception shortly, in\n \u00a74.\n\nFitch\u2019s method, like Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s, is graphical and\ninvolves a method of indicating Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s boxes and\nsuppositions. The rules are of two types: those that refer to previous\nlines but have the new formula within the same box as the previous\nlines, and those that allow a box to be ended, with the new formula in\nthe next outer box. But rather than drawing an entire box, the Fitch\nmethod uses just the left side of the box, and rather than\nsuppositions being merely the first line of a new box, the Fitch\nmethod indicates them by entering them just above a short horizontal\nline.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Fitch style proof. [An\n extended description of figure 3\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe rules employed in this\n proof[8]\n illustrate an aspect of natural deduction that is thought (by some)\nto be very important in the metatheory of natural deduction: that each\nconnective of the language should have an introduction rule and an\nelimination rule\u2014or as this is sometimes put, the entire logic\nshould be organized into pairs of Introduction and Elimination\n(Int-Elim for short) rules for each logical operator. We discuss this\nfeature in\n \u00a75\n on normalization. We note here that Fitch\u2019s exact formulation\ndoes not meet this Int-Elim requirement because it has, in addition to\nthe usual rules, Int-Elim rules for certain combinations of\nconnectives, namely the negations of connectives. Thus there are\nInt-Elim rules for such formula types as \\(\\neg(\\phi\\land\\psi)\\),\n\\(\\neg(\\phi\\lor\\psi)\\) and \\(\\neg(\\phi\\rightarrow\\psi)\\):\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\nFigure 4: Fitch-Style Negative\nElim-Rules: Negative-Int rules are the inverses of these. [An\n extended description of figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis affects arguments about the semantic significance of natural\ndeduction, and slightly complicates some metatheoretic developments,\nbut Fitch\u2019s negative Int-Elim rules are paired in a way that\nsuffices for analogues of many standard results (as we discuss in\n \u00a75.3).\n It might be noted that Gentzen\u2019s presentation tends to be\npreferred by writers on technical proof theory, but Fitch\u2019s\npresentation by writers of elementary textbooks. People who have\nlearned one presentation of natural deduction often initially find\nothers opaque, but with experience the \u201ctranslation\u201d\nbecomes routine. The transformation of a proof in one style of natural\ndeduction into one in another is a simple matter of cutting and\npasting (or perhaps, since Gentzen\u2019s tree-form presentation\noften requires multiple copies of some formulas, cutting,\nphotocopying, and pasting). But however natural deduction systems are\npresented, they have rules of two types. There are rules of\ninference, by which a formula may be inferred from one or more\nprevious formulas. (Some systems also allow \u201czero-premiss\u201d\nrules, by which formulas of specified kinds can be written anywhere\ndesired: in effect, logical axiom schemes.) The typically rules of\ninference include these:\n\n\\(\\land\\)-Introduction: a conjunction may be inferred from its two\n conjuncts.[9]\n\\(\\land\\)-Elimination: a conjunct may be inferred from a\n conjunction.[10]\n\\(\\lor\\)-Introduction: a disjunction may be inferred from either\n disjunct.[11]\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-Elimination: \\(B\\) may be inferred from the two\npremises \\(A\\) and \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\)\n\\(\\neg\\)-Elimination: an arbitrary formula, \\(B\\), may be inferred\nfrom a pair of contradictory premises, \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\n A\\).[12]\n\n\nThere are also what Ja\u015bkowski calls rules of\nsupposition, in which conclusions are inferred, not from earlier\nformulas, but from the presence of one or more subproofs of a\nspecified kind. Typically (described in Fitch-style terminology) these\ninclude:\n\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)-Introduction: \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) may be asserted\nafter a subproof having \\(A\\) as its hypothesis and and \\(B\\) as a\nline.\n\\(\\lor\\)-Elimination: an arbitrary formula \\(C\\) may be asserted\nafter three items: a disjunction, \\((A\\lor B)\\), a subproof, having\n\\(A\\) as its hypothesis, with \\(C\\) as a line, and a subproof, having\n\\(B\\) as its hypothesis, with \\(C\\) as a line.\n\\(\\neg\\)-Introduction: a negation, \\(\\neg A\\), may be asserted\nafter a subproof, with \\(A\\) as its hypothesis, containing a pair of\ncontradictory formulas, \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\), as\n lines.[13]\n\n\nJust as, in axiomatic formulations of logic (\u201cFrege\nsystems\u201d or \u201cHilbert-style\u201d systems), different\nchoices of axioms are possible for a particular logic, different sets\nof rules can be chosen in formulating a natural deduction system. In\nparticular, one or more rules of supposition can, in the presence of\nothers, be replaced by inference rules. Thus, for example, it is\npossible to have\n \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I[14]as\n the only rule of supposition, any others being replaced by inference\nrules having, among their premisses, conditionals summarizing the\nsubproofs of the original rules. (Elementary students may find it\neasier to learn inference rules than to learn suppositional rules, in\nwhich case this sort of system may be a rational choice for elementary\ntextbooks.) Alternatively, \\(\\neg\\)-I may be taken as the only rule of\nsupposition, \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I being replaced by a rule allowing\n\\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) to be inferred from \\(\\neg(A\\land\\neg B)\\). Other\nchoices are also possible. D\u2019Agostino, Gabbay, and Modgil (2020)\npresent a very elegant system for Classical propositional logic in\nwhich the only rule of supposition is an \u201cexcluded middle\u201d\nrule: a formula may be asserted if it is derived in each of a pair of\nsubproofs, the hypothesis of one being the negation of the hypothesis\nof the other.\n",
