    "main_text": "A bit of history\n1. A bit of history\nTypelogical grammar has its roots in two seminal papers written by\nJim Lambek half a century ago (Lambek 1958, 1961). In these papers,\nthe author set himself the aim \u201cto obtain an effective rule (or\nalgorithm) for distinguishing sentences from non-sentences, which\nworks not only for the formal languages of interest to the\nmathematical logician, but also for natural languages\n[\u2026]\u201d. To realize this goal, the familiar parts of speech\n(nouns, verbs, \u2026) are turned into formulas of a logic \u2014 a\nlogic designed to reason about grammatical composition.  The judgement\nwhether a phrase is wellformed, under this view, is the outcome of a\nprocess of deduction.  A decision procedure for such judgements is\nobtained by casting the grammar logic in the format of a Gentzen-style\nsequent calculus.  The sequent presentation is extremely simple: the\nlogic of grammar is a logic without structural rules.  Contraction and\nWeakening are dropped; their presence would entail that wellformedness\nis unaffected by arbitrary copying or deletion of grammatical\nmaterial.  To take into account also word order and phrase structure\ninformation, Lambek further removes the structural rules of Exchange\nand (in the 1961 paper) Associativity.\nAt the time of their publication, these ideas did not resonate;\ntheir impact on the field of computational linguistics dates from\nthe 1980s. Two factors have played an important role in this belated\nrecognition.  The first was the addition of a computational semantics\nfor categorial derivations along the lines of the Curry-Howard\nproofs-as-programs interpretation in van Benthem 1983, reprinted in\nBuszkowski et al. 1988. Lambek's typelogical grammars, so\nviewed, could be seen to realize Montague\u2019s compositionality\nprogram in an uncompromising way, with the lambda calculus and type\ntheory providing powerful tools to study derivational and lexical\nsemantics. The second factor was the introduction of linear logic\n(Girard 1987), and with it, the surge of interest in substructural\nlogics. A key insight from linear logic injected into typelogical\ngrammar is the idea that structural rules can be reintroduced in a\ncontrolled form by means of so-called modalities: in moving to more\ndiscriminating type logics, no expressivity is lost. From a\ncomputational point of view, variants of the proof nets of linear\nlogic have provided the basis for typelogical natural language\nprocessing.\nTypelogical grammar, in its current incarnations, keeps the general\narchitecture of Lambek's original calculi, but extends this to a more\narticulate vocabulary of type-forming operations.  Of central\nimportance are the multiplicative operations, used to model\ngrammatical composition; these form the focus of this article. Next to\nthe multiplicatives one can consider additive or Boolean operations\nand first or second order quantification to handle phenomena of\nlexical ambiguity, type polymorphism and the management of feature\ninformation. Morrill 1994 is a good source of examples for such\nextensions.\nOutline of this article.  We start with the standard\nLambek systems. We study their model-theoretic and proof-theoretic\naspects (frame semantics, sequent calculus), and the relation between\nthe two (soundness, completeness). We characterize compositional\ninterpretation as a homomorphism relating a syntactic source calculus\nand a target calculus for meaning assembly. The mapping associates\nsyntactic derivations with semantic readings, expressed as terms of\nthe simply typed linear lambda calculus.  In \u00a73 we turn to the\nexpressive limitations of the standard Lambek systems, in syntax and\nsemantics, and study how they can be addressed by systematically\nextending the categorial architecture in a modular way.\nGeneralizations concern the arity of the type-forming operations\n(binary composition operations versus unary control operators);\nmultimodal extensions where multiple families of type-forming\noperations co-exist and communicate via structural interaction\nprinciples; one-sorted vs multi-sorted logics (discontinuous calculi);\nsingle-conclusion vs multiple-conclusion systems (symmetric calculi);\nand more structured views of the syntax- semantics interface\n(continuation semantics). To close the panoramic tour, we present\nproof nets for the various typelogical systems studied in \u00a73, and\nwe compare these systems with respect to expressivity and\ncomputational tractability.\n",
