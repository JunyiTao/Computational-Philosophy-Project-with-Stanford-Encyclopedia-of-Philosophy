The foundations of public policy\nregarding organ procurement provide an instructive example. Established\nlegal and policy precedents in many countries require express consent\nby a decedent before death or by the family after death. A near\nabsolute right of autonomy to decide about the disposition of organs\nand tissues has been the prevailing norm. However, this approach\nimpairs the efficient collection of needed tissues and organs, and many\npeople die as a result of the shortage of organs. The scarcity of\norgans and tissues and the inefficiency of the system have prompted a\nspate of proposals for reform of the current system of procurement,\nwith the goal of creating more space for social beneficence.\n\n\nOne policy proposal with a notably strong social-beneficence\ncommitment is the routine retrieval of organs and tissues. In\nthis system of procurement, a community is permitted to, and encouraged\nto, routinely collect organs and tissues from the deceased, unless the\ndead person had previously registered his or her objection to the\nsystem with the state. The routine retrieval of tissues and organs from\nthe deceased is regarded by many as unjustified on traditional grounds\nof respect for autonomy. However, advocates of the policy of routine\nretrieval argue that members of a community have an obligation to\nprovide other persons with objects of lifesaving value when no cost to\nthemselves is required. That is, the justification is based on\nbeneficence, not respect for autonomy.\n\n\nThe debate is likely to continue for many years about whether\nbeneficence or respect for autonomy should prevail in public policy\ngoverning organ retrieval. Advocates of the current system argue that\nindividual and family rights of consent should retain dominance.\nAdvocates of routine retrieval argue that traditional social priorities\ninvolving beneficence in conflict with autonomy have been wrongly\nstructured. Meanwhile, most contributors to the literature on the\nsubject agree that the present situation of low-level organ-procurement\nis morally unsatisfactory and in need of some significant measure of\nreform.\n",
