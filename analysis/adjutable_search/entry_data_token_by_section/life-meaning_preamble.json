    "main_text": "\n\nMany major historical figures in philosophy have provided an answer to\nthe question of what, if anything, makes life meaningful, although\nthey typically have not put it in these terms (with such talk having\narisen only in the past 250 years or so, on which see\u00a0Landau\n1997). Consider, for instance, Aristotle on the human function,\nAquinas on the beatific vision, and Kant on the highest good.\nRelatedly, think about Koheleth, the presumed author of the Biblical\nbook Ecclesiastes, describing life as \u201cfutility\u201d and akin\nto \u201cthe pursuit of wind,\u201d Nietzsche on nihilism, as well\nas Schopenhauer when he remarks that whenever we reach a goal we have\nlonged for we discover \u201chow vain and empty it is.\u201d While\nthese concepts have some bearing on happiness and virtue (and their\nopposites), they are straightforwardly construed (roughly) as accounts\nof which highly ranked\u00a0purposes\u00a0a person ought to realize\nthat would make her life significant (if any would).\n\nDespite the venerable pedigree, it is only since the 1980s or so that\na distinct field of the meaning of life has been established in\nAnglo-American-Australasian philosophy, on which this survey focuses,\nand it is only in the past 20 years that debate with real depth and\nintricacy has appeared. Two decades ago analytic reflection on\nlife\u2019s meaning was described as a \u201cbackwater\u201d\ncompared to that on well-being or good character, and it was possible\nto cite nearly all the literature in a given critical discussion of\nthe field (Metz 2002). Neither is true any longer.\nAnglo-American-Australasian philosophy of life\u2019s meaning has\nbecome vibrant, such that there is now way too much literature to be\nable to cite comprehensively in this survey. To obtain focus, it tends\nto discuss books, influential essays, and more recent works, and it\nleaves aside contributions from other philosophical traditions (such\nas the Continental or African) and from non-philosophical fields\n(e.g., psychology or literature). This survey\u2019s central aim is\nto acquaint the reader with current analytic approaches to\nlife\u2019s meaning, sketching major debates and pointing out\nneglected topics that merit further consideration.\n\nWhen the topic of the meaning of life comes up, people tend to pose\none of three questions: \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d,\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d, and \u201cIs life in fact\nmeaningful?\u201d. The literature on life's meaning composed by those\nworking in the analytic tradition (on which this entry\nfocuses)\u00a0can be usefully organized according to which question it\nseeks to answer. This survey starts off with recent work that\naddresses the first, abstract (or \u201cmeta\u201d) question\nregarding the sense of talk of \u201clife\u2019s meaning,\u201d\ni.e., that aims to clarify what we have in mind when inquiring into\nthe meaning of life (section 1). Afterward, it considers texts that\nprovide answers to the more substantive question about the nature of\nmeaningfulness (sections 2\u20133). There is in the making a\nsub-field of applied meaning that parallels applied ethics, in which\nmeaningfulness is considered in the context of particular cases or\nspecific themes. Examples include downshifting (Levy 2005),\nimplementing genetic enhancements (Agar 2013), making achievements\n(Bradford 2015), getting an education (Schinkel et al. 2015),\ninteracting with research participants (Olson 2016), automating labor\n(Danaher 2017), and creating children (Ferracioli 2018). In contrast,\nthis survey focuses nearly exclusively on contemporary\nnormative-theoretical approaches to life\u2019s meanining, that is,\nattempts to capture in a single, general principle all the variegated\nconditions that could confer meaning on life. Finally, this survey\nexamines fresh arguments for the nihilist view that the conditions\nnecessary for a meaningful life do not obtain for any of us, i.e.,\nthat all our lives are meaningless (section 4).\n",
