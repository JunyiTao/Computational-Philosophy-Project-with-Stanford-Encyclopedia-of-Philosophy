    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe frame problem originated as a narrowly defined technical problem\nin\n logic-based artificial intelligence\n (AI).\nBut it was taken up in an embellished and modified form by\nphilosophers of mind, and given a wider interpretation. The tension\nbetween its origin in the laboratories of AI researchers and its\ntreatment at the hands of philosophers engendered an interesting\nand sometimes heated debate in the 1980s and 1990s.\nBut since the narrow, technical problem is largely solved, recent\ndiscussion has tended to focus less on matters of interpretation and\nmore on the implications of the wider frame problem for \n cognitive science.\nTo gain an understanding of the issues,\nthis article will begin with a look at the frame problem in its\ntechnical guise. Some of the ways in which philosophers have\nre-interpreted the problem will then be examined. The article\nwill conclude with an assessment of the significance of the frame\nproblem today.\n",
