    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || John Buridan\n3.8 John Buridan\n\nJohn Buridan was another logician of the 14th century\nholding a theory of the insolubles similar to Bradwardine\u2019s and\nthe modified Heytesbury solution. However, there may have been no\ndirect influence. Like Rimini, Buridan also taught at the University\nof Paris, but unlike Rimini, rather unusually remained a teaching\nmaster in the Arts Faculty for his entire career, from the 1320s until\nat least 1358. We can trace the development of his approach to the\ninsolubles from his early Quaestiones Elencorum, dating from\nthe 1330s, and Treatise on Consequences, through his\ncommentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics,\nSophistical Refutations, and Metaphysics, to the\nvarious treatises of the Summulae de Dialectica, which was\nrepeatedly revised over twenty years. His final view is described in\nthe ninth and last treatise of the Summulae, with the\nindependent title Sophismata, in a version from the mid-1350s\n(see Pironet 1993).\n\nBuridan\u2019s early view was that every proposition, not just\ninsolubles, signifies its own truth. This idea, which we have already\nencountered in Segrave and the modified Heytesbury solution, can be\nfound as early as Bonaventure\u2019s Quaestiones disputatae de\nmysterio Trinitatis (q1 a1), composed in the 1250s. Buridan gives\nonly the briefest of arguments for this claim about signification, not\ngrounding it in any principle like Bradwardine\u2019s (P2). He\nwrites, in his early work Questiones Elencorum (Buridan 1994,\np.92):\n\nFor every proposition is affirmative or negative. But each of them\nsignifies itself to be true or at least from each it follows that it\nis true. This is clear first concerning affirmatives, for every\naffirmative proposition signifies that its subject and predicate\nsupposit for the same, and this is for it to be true ... Secondly, it\nis clear concerning negatives, for a negative does not signify that\nthe subject and predicate supposit for the same, and this is for the\nnegative proposition to be true.\n Thus insolubles, which signify their own falsity,\nsignify that they are both true and false, and so are false.\nBuridan\u2019s view on insolubles may have developed out of Girard of\nOdo\u2019s, whose Logica was composed in Paris in the early\n1320s. Girard\u2019s idea was that the Liar paradox, \u2018I say\nsomething false\u2019, has four things wrong with it\n(malitiae), the fourth being that, since it is affirmative,\nit asserts the unity of its subject with its predicate, but its\npredicate (\u2018something false\u2019) denies this (see Giraldus\nOdonis Logica, 396\u20138).\n\n\nHowever, as early as the Treatise on Consequences, Buridan\nthinks this final step, concluding that insolubles are false because\nthey signify that they are both true and false, needs qualification.\nFor he rejects the idea that a proposition is true if things are how\nit signifies, even however it signifies. Things can be, e.g., how\n\u2018No proposition is negative\u2019 signifies, but it cannot be\ntrue (since it is itself negative, and thus falsifies itself when\nformed). Rather, affirmative propositions are true if their terms\nsupposit for the same, negative if they supposit for different things.\nIndeed, he later rejects the suggestion that propositions signify\ntheir own truth. He did so both for ontological reasons, since that\nwould require some kind of propositional meanings (the famous\ncomplexe significabilia\u2014see, e.g., Klima 2009:\n\u00a710.2); and also because that would make every proposition\nmeta-linguistic. Rather, his later theory claims that every\nproposition virtually implies another proposition asserting the truth\nof the first. Then an insoluble like \u2018Socrates utters a\nfalsehood\u2019, uttered by Socrates, is false not because its terms\ndon\u2019t supposit for the same, but because the terms in the\nimplied proposition can\u2019t also do so. Buridan\u2019s solution\nhas been much discussed in recent decades and has been edited and\ntranslated several times (see Buridan [B-S], [B-S2], [B-B], [B-SD],\n[B-SD2]), but it is deeply problematic (see, e.g., Read 2002: \u00a75;\nRead 2006: \u00a76; with a response on Buridan\u2019s behalf in Klima\n2009, \u00a710.5).\n",
