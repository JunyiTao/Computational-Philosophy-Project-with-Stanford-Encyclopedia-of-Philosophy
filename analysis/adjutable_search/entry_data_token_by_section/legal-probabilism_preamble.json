    "main_text": "\n\nLegal probabilism is a research program that relies on probability\ntheory to analyze, model and improve the evaluation of evidence and\nthe process of decision-making in trial proceedings. While the\nexpression \u201clegal probabilism\u201d seems to have been coined\nby Haack (2014b), the underlying idea can be traced back to the early\ndays of probability theory (see, for example, Bernoulli 1713). Another\nterm that is sometimes encountered in the literature is \u201ctrial\nby mathematics\u201d coined by Tribe (1971). Legal probabilism\nremains a minority view among legal scholars, but attained greater\npopularity in the second half of the twentieth century in conjunction\nwith the law and economics movement (Becker 1968; Calabresi 1961;\nPosner 1973).\n\nTo illustrate the range of applications of legal probabilism, consider\na stylized case. Alice is charged with murder. Traces at the crime\nscene, which the perpetrator probably left, genetically match\nAlice. An eyewitness testifies that Alice ran away from the scene\nafter the crime was committed. Another witness asserts that Alice had\npreviously threatened the victim multiple times. Alice, however, has\nan alibi. Mark claims he was with her for the entire day. This case\nraises several questions. How should the evidence be evaluated? How to\ncombine conflicting pieces of evidence, such as the incriminating DNA\nmatch and the alibi testimony? If the standard of decision in a murder\ncase is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, how strong should the\nevidence be to meet this standard?\n\nLegal probabilism is a theoretical framework\nthat helps to address these different questions. Finkelstein and\nFairley (1970) gave one of the first systematic analyses of how\nprobability theory, and Bayes\u2019 theorem in particular, can help\nto evaluate evidence at trial (see\n Section 1).\n After the discovery of DNA fingerprinting, many legal probabilists\nfocused on how probability theory could be used to quantify the\nstrength of a DNA match (see\n Section 2).\n Recent work in Artificial Intelligence made it possible to use\nprobability theory\u2014in the form of Bayesian networks\u2014to\nevaluate complex bodies of evidence consisting of multiple components\n(see\n Section 3).\n Following the work of Lempert (1977), likelihood ratios are now\ncommonly used as probabilistic measures of the relevance of the\nevidence presented at trial (see\n Section 4).\n Other authors, starting with seminal papers by Kaplan (1968) and Cullison (1969),\ndeployed probability theory and decision theory to model decision-making and standards of\nproof at trial (see\n Section 5).\n\nLegal probabilism is no doubt controversial. Many legal theorists and\nphilosophers, starting with Tribe (1971), leveled several critiques\nagainst it. These critiques range from difficulties in assessing the\nprobability of someone\u2019s criminal or civil liability to the\ndehumanization of trial decisions to misconstruing how the process of evidence evaluation and decision-making takes place in trial proceedings.\n\nA key challenge for legal probabilism\u2014one that has\ngalvanized philosophical attention in recent years\u2014comes from\nthe paradoxes of legal proof or puzzles of naked statistical evidence. Nesson (1979), Cohen (1977) and Thomson\n(1986) formulated scenarios in which, despite a high probability of\nguilt or civil liability based on the available evidence, a verdict\nagainst the defendant seems unwarranted (see\n Section 6).\n Other challenges for legal probabilism include the problem of\nconjunction and the reference class problem (see\n Section 7).\n\nLegal probabilism can also be understood as a far reaching research\nprogram that aims to analyze\u2014by means of probability\ntheory\u2014the trial system as a whole, including institutions such\nas the jury system and trial procedure. Some early French probability\ntheorists examined the relationship between jury size, jury voting\nrules and the risk of convicting an innocent (Condorcet 1785; Laplace\n1814; Poisson 1837; for more recent discussions, see Kaye 1980;\nNitzan 2009; Suzuki 2015).\n\nAt the root of this more radical version of legal probabilism lies the\ndream of discerning patterns in the behavior of individuals and\nimproving legal institutions (Hacking 1990). Today\u2019s rapid grow\nof data\u2014paired with machine learning and the pervasiveness of\ncost-benefit analysis\u2014has rendered this dream more alive than\never before (Ferguson 2020). For a critique of mathematization,\nquantification and cost-benefit analysis applied to the justice\nsystem, see Allen (2013) and Harcourt (2018). This entry will not, however, discuss\nthis far reaching version of legal probabilism.\n",
