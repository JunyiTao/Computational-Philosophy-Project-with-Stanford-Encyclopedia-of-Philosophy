    "main_text": "Ferguson and the social state\n11. Ferguson and the social state\n\nOne of Blair\u2019s colleagues at Edinburgh University was Adam\nFerguson (1723\u20131816). He succeeded David Hume as librarian of\nthe Advocates\u2019 Library in Edinburgh and then held in succession\ntwo chairs at Edinburgh University, that of natural philosophy\n(1759\u20131764) and of pneumatics and moral philosophy\n(1764\u20131785). His lectures at Edinburgh were published as\nThe Institutes of Moral Philosophy (1769) and\nPrinciples of Moral and Political Science (1792). Ferguson\nadvocates a form of moral science based on the study of human\nbeings as they are and then grounds a normative account of what they\nought to be upon this empirical basis. His most influential work\nis An Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767). There\nFerguson attended to one of the main concepts of the Enlightenment,\nthat of human progress, and expressed doubts about whether over the\ncenturies the proportion of human happiness to unhappiness had\nincreased. He believed that each person accommodates himself to the\nconditions in his own society and the fact that we cannot imagine that\nwe would be contented if we lived in an earlier society does not imply\nthat people in earlier societies were not, more or less, as happy in\ntheir own society as we are in ours. As against our unscientific\nconjectures about how we would have felt in a society profoundly\nunlike the only one we have ever lived in, Ferguson commends the use\nof historical records. He talks disparagingly about boundless regions\nof ignorance in our conjectures about other societies, and among those\nhe has in mind who speak ignorantly about earlier conditions of\nhumanity are Hobbes, Rousseau, and Hume in their discussions of the\nstate of nature and the origins of society.\n\nHobbes and Rousseau in particular had a good deal to say about the\npre-social condition of humankind. Ferguson argues, against their\ntheories, that there are no records whatever of a pre-social human\ncondition; and since on the available evidence humankind has always\nlived in society he concludes that living in society comes naturally\nto us. Hence the state of nature is a social state and is not\nantecedent to it. Instead of state of nature and contract theory,\nFerguson advocates the use of history, of the accounts of travellers,\nand the literature and myths of societies to build an account of types\nof human society. Ferguson\u2019s discussion of types of society, ideas\nof civilisation and civil society has seen him credited with an\ninfluential place in the development of sociology. This method is\nubiquitous across the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, with a\nparticularly influential discussion of the method to be found in\nJohn Millar\u2019s The Origin of the Distinction of Ranks\n(1779).\n",
