    "main_text": "Arnauld\u2019s Compatibilism || Arnauld\u2019s late position on the nature of free will\n6.5 The advantages Arnauld claims for his new theory over Jansen\u2019s theory\n\nArnauld claims a number of advantages for his theory of free will over\nthat of Jansen. In particular, he claims that, when combined with the\naccount of the nature of grace that he found in Estius, it makes it\neasier to reconcile the intrinsic efficacy of grace with freedom.\n\nIn following [Estius\u2019s opinion regarding efficacious grace], it\nis much easier to explain the efficacy of the grace, and to reconcile\nit with freedom, especially when we define free will, following St.\nThomas, as a facultas ad opposita. (Letter to Bossuet,\njuillet 1694, OA, 3:664).\n\n\nExplaining the efficacy of grace is easier on Estius\u2019s theory\nthan on the competing theories, because it is simpler. On the\ncompeting theories, which include Jansen\u2019s, the efficacy of\nactual grace of the will depends on a connection of some sort, within\nthe mind of a creature, between a created grace, like Jansen\u2019s\n\u201cvictorious pleasure,\u201d and a meritorious choice.\nEstius\u2019s theory is simpler: The efficacy of actual grace is a\ndirect consequence of the general principle that God\u2019s absolute\nwill is infallibly realized.\n\nBut how does Estius\u2019s theory, combined with the account of free\nwill that Arnauld derived from St. Thomas, help to reconcile the\nefficacy of grace with free will? According to Jansen, freedom of will\nis the same as spontaneity, and so every act of will is essentially\nfree. Jansen qualifies that position by adding that during life here\non earth, human beings have another kind of freedom:\n\nThe freedom of man the pilgrim is not only exempt from constraint, but\neven from immutable voluntary necessity (necessitatis\nimmutabilis voluntariae), that it, this freedom is indifferent\nbetween doing good and doing evil, between acting and not acting.\n(Quoted by Arnauld in Seconde Apologie, OA, 17:242).\n\n\nWhen he says that the will is indifferent as between doing good and\ndoing evil, and between acting or not acting, during this life here\nbelow, Jansen means that during life on Earth, the will remains\nmutable or \u201cflexible\u201d between doing good and doing evil,\nand again, willing or not willing any particular action or end. In\nother words, the will is not confirmed in good or evil during this\nlife in such a way that it could not fall away from willing the good\nor be converted from willing what is evil, and again in such a way\nthat it could not cease willing what it does will or begin willing\nwhat it does not will.\n\nNow on theories like those of Jansen and Ba\u00f1ez, the intrinsic\nefficacy of grace involves the determination of a person\u2019s\nvolition by an antecedent state of his or her mind, and this seems to\nconflict with the proposition that the volition is free. On\nEstius\u2019s view, on the other hand, a person\u2019s meritorious\nvolition is determined not by an antecedent state of his or her mind,\nbut rather by the will of God. Is this an improvement, with respect to\nexplaining the compatibility of efficacious grace with free will?\nArnauld says it is, \u201cespecially when we define free will,\nfollowing St. Thomas, as a facultas ad opposita.\u201d\n\nHere Arnauld appeals to the Thomistic principle that when God causes a\ncreature to act, He always causes the creature to act in accordance\nwith its nature. Paraphrasing Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, I,\n82, 1, ad 3), Arnauld says,\n\nWhen God works our volition in us, He brings it about that we will in\nconformity with our nature, that is by determining ourselves to what\nwe are not determined by nature. Thus no matter with what efficacy the\nmind is moved by God, it acts as master of its very own action, and it\nwills because it wills, determining itself to all other things by its\nvolition to be happy, and hence it acts freely\n(Libert\u00e9, OA,\n 10:616).[40]\n\n\nArnauld\u2019s line of thought seems to be as follows: Human beings\nare attracted to limited goods only as means to the unlimited good of\nhappiness. Therefore, whenever a human being is attracted to a limited\ngood, he or she can attend to its goodness and will it, or attend to\nsome way in which it falls short of the unlimited good and refrain\nfrom willing it. Which of these options is realized is determined by\nthe human being, or more precisely, the human being\u2019s mind;\nthus, in willing or not willing any limited good, the human mind is\nself-determining and free. All this is part of the nature of the human\nmind. So if God moves the human mind to will a limited good, He moves\nit to will in a self-determining and free way.\n\nIf pressed for more details about how God by His merciful will\n(uncreated grace) moves a human being to will a particular good, while\nyet leaving it up to the human being whether he or she wills that\ngood, Arnauld would surely say that we human beings cannot understand\nGod\u2019s causality well enough to supply such details. Our\ninability to understand God\u2019s causality with regard to the\ncreated world is a common theme in Arnauld. It is expressed forcefully\nin his first contribution to the Leibniz-Arnauld exchange, written in\n1686, not long after Libert\u00e9. Arnauld says that\nalthough we are certain that God, \u201cby a single and very simple\nact, which is His essence,\u201d knows all things, including things\nthat might not have been, and wills things that He might not have\nwilled by His will, which is also His essence, nevertheless we cannot\nunderstand how God does these things, because \u201cas far\nas we are concerned (\u00e0 notre \u00e9gard) God dwells\nin inaccessible light\u201d (LA, p.\n 31\u201332).[41]\n\nBefore presenting the above theory of free will in\nLibert\u00e9, Arnauld prepares the ground by presenting two\nexamples in which a person\u2019s volition occurs\n\u201cinfallibly\u201d and yet freely, in the sense of freedom\n\u201cthat is necessary and sufficient for merit or demerit\u201d\n(Libert\u00e9, OA, 10:620). The examples are\npreceded by the statement,\n\nHowever infallible be the determination by which the will is\ndetermined with the attention of reason, to objects to which it is not\nnaturally determined, freedom suffers no damage\n(pr\u00e9judice); because the infallible determination does\nnot prevent the soul from willing because it wills; and hence it is\nmaster of its action (Libert\u00e9, OA,\n10:615\u201316).\n\n\nThe first example is that of a prince who is in love with a woman and\nhas \u201ca vehement passion for the pleasures of the flesh.\u201d\nIf the woman offers herself to the prince, \u201che will infallibly\nsatisfy his passion.\u201d The second example is that of a cruel and\nrevengeful king, who has been offended by one of his subjects and has\nthe subject in his power: \u201cInfallibly he will destroy\n him.\u201d[42]\n Everyone who is not \u201centirely barbarian,\u201d says Arnauld,\nwill agree that the prince and the king have acted demeritoriously and\ndeserve punishment. Thus all such people agree that the king and the\nprince acted in a relevantly free way.\n\nOne might take these passages to suggest that the freedom necessary\nand sufficient for merit and demerit is compatible with determination\nof the will by psychological causes. But this misses Arnauld\u2019s\npoint, and is an unlikely interpretation. To begin with, Arnauld\nsurely realized that it was not impossible for the lascivious prince\nor the cruel king act otherwise than in the way described; people do\nsometimes act out of character. Furthermore, Arnauld seems to think of\ninfallibility, like its cousin, certainty, as a matter of degree. This\nis indicated by the phrase, \u201cHowever infallible be the\ndetermination by which the will is determined with the attention of\nreason \u2026\u201d The certainty that the cruel king and the\nlascivious prince would act in the ways indicated could have been very\nhigh and yet they could have acted otherwise.\n\nArnauld\u2019s point is not that the actions of the prince and the\nking are causally determined by psychological states antecedent to\ntheir volitions. In both cases he says that the action is free because\nthe person could have willed not to perform the action, or again,\nbecause the person\u2019s will was a potestas ad opposita.\nArnauld\u2019s point is that our certainty that the prince and the\nking will act in the ways described does not lessen our certainty that\nthey will act freely. The same, he says, is true of our certainty that\na meritorious act will be carried out as a result of efficacious\ngrace, that is, as a result of God\u2019s merciful will moving a\nperson to that act. Arnauld claims that our certainty about the\nfreedom of the act produced by efficacious grace, like our certainty\nabout the freedom of the actions of the prince and the king, is well\ngrounded because in all of these cases, the person had the power to\nrefrain from the act in question; in all of these cases, the\nperson\u2019s will is a facultas ad\n opposita.[43]\n\nThere is, of course, an important difference between examples like\nthose of the prince and the king, and example of an action to which\none is moved by efficacious grace. In examples of the former sort, the\naction occurs only with very great, but not absolute, certainty,\nwhereas in the case of efficacious grace, the action follows with\nabsolute certainty upon God\u2019s intention that it take place. This\ndifference may seem to damage Arnauld\u2019s case: One can plausibly\nsay that it was within the power of the prince, for example, not to\nwill to satisfy his lust, precisely because it was not absolutely\ncertain that, in the given circumstances, he would do so. But no\nsimilar claim can be made about the person whom God moves, by\nefficacious grace, to elicit a meritorious volition. Yet Arnauld\ninsists that in the latter case also, it is within the power of the\nperson not to elicit the volition. It is at this point that\nArnauld\u2019s views about the mysteriousness of divine causality\ncome into play. Our inability to understand how God moves a person to\na meritorious volition, while leaving it within the person\u2019s\npower not to elicit the volition, thus moving the person to will in a\nself-determining way, is not, in Arnauld\u2019s view, surprising, for\nwe are unable, in general, to understand how God produces effects\noutside of Himself.\n\nArnauld\u2019s work between 1682 and 1694 is a testament to his\nintellectual vitality. It is remarkable that he was hard at work,\nuntil his death at the age of 82, on a set of connected controversies\nand issues, both philosophical and theological, having to do with\ncreation, grace, and free will. Though he did not construct a\nphilosophical system, he stands out in a century of geniuses for the\nvigorous and penetrating way in which he dealt with many of the\nimportant philosophers and philosophical problems of the time.\n",
