    "main_text": "\n\n\n\u201cAfricana philosophy\u201d is the name for an emergent and\nstill developing field of ideas and idea-spaces, intellectual\nendeavors, discourses, and discursive networks within and beyond\nacademic philosophy that was recognized as such by national and\ninternational organizations of professional philosophers, including the\nAmerican Philosophical Association, starting in the 1980s. Thus, the\nname does not refer to a particular philosophy, philosophical system,\nmethod, or tradition. Rather, Africana philosophy is a\nthird-order, metaphilosophical, umbrella-concept used to bring\norganizing oversight to various efforts of\nphilosophizing\u2014that is, activities of reflective,\ncritical thinking and articulation and aesthetic\nexpression\u2014engaged in by persons and peoples African and of\nAfrican descent who were and are indigenous residents of continental\nAfrica and residents of the many African Diasporas worldwide. In all\ncases the point of much of the philosophizings has been to confer\nmeaningful orderings on individual and shared living and on natural and\nsocial worlds while resolving recurrent, emergent, and\nradically disruptive challenges to existence so as to survive,\nendure, and flourish across successive generations.\n\n\nThe emergent third-order work defining the field has been focused on\nidentifying for research and teaching, and for further refinements and\nnew developments of, instances of philosophical articulations and\nexpressions regarding what has been, and is, of thoughtful, aesthetic\nsignificance to persons African and of African descent. This work has\nproduced educative catalogings and critical surveys of particular ideas\nand idea-spaces; intellectual and aesthetic expressive agendas,\npractices, and traditions; and networks of individuals, organizations,\nand institutions serving philosophizing in African and\nAfrican-descended life-worlds.\n",
