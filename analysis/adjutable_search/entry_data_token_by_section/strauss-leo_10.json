    "main_text": "Controversies Revisited\n11. Remaining Problems with Strauss\u2019s Philosophy\n\nLeaving aside legitimate debate about the intellectual history of\nwestern civilization that Strauss sketches, problems remain with many\nof his philosophical contentions. Strauss certainly cannot be said to\nhave offered definitive arguments against historicism, definitive\narguments for or against revelation, or definitive arguments for a\nreturn to \u201cnature.\u201d Rather, in all these cases, one might\nargue, Strauss has merely begged the question. Strauss historicizes\nphilosophy in order to make an argument for timeless truth. His\nrational defenses of both the possibility of revelation and\nphilosophical rationalism are made on the basis of a critique of\nreason\u2019s self-sufficiency. Finally, Strauss\u2019s claims about\na return to \u201cnature\u201d rest not upon arguments for\n\u201cnature\u201d but rather upon arguments about the consequences\nof not having a conception of \u201cnature.\u201d\n\nIn the end, how one evaluates the circular nature of Strauss\u2019s\nquestions and answers will depend upon how seriously one takes\nStrauss\u2019s diagnosis of the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament of modernity.\u201d If one does not think Strauss has\nmade a serious case for the dire intellectual and political\nimplications of this predicament, then one will not be persuaded that\nStrauss has done much more than creatively re-read some pre-modern\nphilosophers, for better or for worse. If on the other hand, one finds\nStrauss\u2019s diagnosis of the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament\u201d persuasive, one might think that Strauss has\naccomplished quite a lot by raising the questions of truth,\nrevelation, and nature anew in a day and age in which discussion of\nthese matters seems to have been deemed moot.\n",
