This is\nbecause taxonomical differences among kinds of truths in different\ndomains can be accounted for simply by doing basic ontology in\nobject-level languages.\n\n\n\n[E]ven if it is one thing for \u2018this tree is an oak\u2019 to\nbe true, another thing for \u2018burning live cats is cruel\u2019 to\nbe true, and yet another for \u2018Buster Keaton is funnier than\nCharlie Chaplin\u2019 to be true, this should not lead us to suppose\nthat \u2018true\u2019 is ambiguous; for we get a better explanation\nof the differences by alluding to the differences between trees,\ncruelty, and humor. (Sainsbury 1996: 900; see also Quine 1960: 131)\n\n\n\nGenerally, pluralists have not yet developed a response to the\nQuine-Sainsbury objection. And for some, this is because the real force\nof the Quine-Sainsbury objection lies in its exposure of the scope\nproblem as a pseudo-problem (Dodd 2013; see also Asay 2018). Again, the idea is that\ntraditional inflationary theories postulate some candidate for\n\\(F\\) but the applicability and plausibility of \\(F\\) differs\nacross regions of discourse. No such theory handles the truths of\nmoral, mathematical, comic, legal, etc. discourse equally well; and\nthis suggests that these theories, by their monism, face limitations on\ntheir explanatory scope. Pluralism offers a non-deflationary solution.\nYet, why think that these differences among domains mark an alethic\ndifference in truth per se, rather than semantic or discursive\ndifferences among the sentences comprising those domains? There is more\nthan one way to score a goal in soccer, for example (via corner kick,\nricochet off the foot of an opposing player or the head of a teammate,\nobstruct the goalkeeper, etc.), but it is far from clear that this\nentails pluralism about the property of scoring a goal in soccer.\n(Analogy belongs to an anonymous referee.) Pluralists have yet to\nadequately address this criticism (although see Blackburn 2013; Lynch 2013b, 2018; Wright 1998 for further discussion).\n",
