    "main_text": "Being and Becoming\n5. Being and Becoming\n\nThe account Timaeus gives of the generation of the universe is from\nthe outset based on metaphysical and epistemological principles\nfamiliar from the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period,\nparticularly the Republic. Introducing the subject of his\ndiscourse, Timaeus posits a distinction between what always is and\nnever becomes and what becomes and never is\n(27d5\u201328a1). He goes on to connect each with its familiar\nepistemological correlate (28a1\u20134): the former is grasped by\nunderstanding (no\u00easis) involving a reasoned account\n(logos), and the latter by opinion (doxa), which\ninvolves unreasoning sense perception (aesth\u00easis\nalogos). Although Timaeus does not here name the types of entity\nthat satisfy these descriptions, the reader familiar with the\nRepublic will call to mind the distinction between forms and\nsensibles (518c, 534a). The role of what is as the model\nafter which the Craftsman designs and constructs the universe (29a)\nrecalls the role of the forms as models for the philosopher-rulers to\nimitate in exercising their statecraft (Rep.\n500b\u2013501c). It is not until much later in Timaeus\u2019\ndiscourse (51b7\u2013e6) that forms are mentioned for the first time,\nand their existence is argued for on the basis of the distinction\n(itself supported by argument) between understanding and (true)\nopinion. And the identification of what becomes with\nsensibles (in this case the universe as an object of sense) is readily\nmade at 28b7\u2013c2 (see 5. in the argument below).\n\nTimaeus\u2019 opening question (\u201cWhat is that which always\nis and never becomes\u2026?\u201d) can be read\nextensionally (\u201cWhat entity or entities are such that they\nalways are and never become\u2026?\u201d) or\nintensionally (\u201cWhat is it for some entity always to be\nand never to become\u2026?\u201d). If read in the former\nway, the answer will be \u201cforms\u201d or \u201ca form.\u201d\nIf read in the latter way, the question is answered immediately in the\ntext \u00a0and hence this reading seems preferable : always to be is\nto be intelligible and unchanging.\n\nThe metaphysical being-becoming distinction and its epistemological\ncorrelate are put to work in an argument that establishes the\nframework for the cosmology to follow. The conclusion of that argument\nis that the universe is a work of craft, produced by a supremely good\nCraftsman in imitation of an eternal model. The reasoning may be\nrepresented as follows:\n\nSome things always are, without ever becoming (27d6).\nSome things become, without ever being (27d6\u201328a1).\nIf and only if a thing always is, then it is grasped by\nunderstanding, involving a rational account (28a1\u20132).\nIf and only if a thing becomes, then it is grasped by opinion,\ninvolving unreasoning sense perception\n (28a2\u20133).[12]\nThe universe is a thing that has become (28b7; from 5a\u2013c,\nand 4).\n\n\nThe universe is visible, tangible and possesses a body\n(28b7\u20138).\nIf a thing is visible, tangible and possesses a body, then it is\nperceptible (28b8).\nIf a thing is perceptible, then it has become (28c1\u20132; also\nentailed by 4).\n \nAnything that becomes is caused to become by something\n(28a4\u20136, c2\u20133).\nThe universe has been caused to become by something (from 5 and\n6).\nThe cause of the universe is a Craftsman, who fashioned the\nuniverse after a model (28a6 ff., c3 ff.; apparently from 7, but see\nbelow).\nThe model of the universe is something that always is\n(29a4\u20135; from 9a\u20139e).\n\n\nEither the model of the universe is something that always is or\nsomething that has become (28a5\u201329a2, also implied at\n28a6\u2013b2).\nIf the universe is beautiful and the Craftsman is good, then the\nmodel of the universe is something that always is (29a2\u20133).\nIf the universe is not beautiful or the Craftsman is not good,\nthen the model of the universe is something that has become\n(29a3\u20135).\nThe universe is supremely beautiful (29a5).\nThe Craftsman is supremely good (29a6).\n \nThe universe is a work of craft, fashioned after an eternal model\n(29a6\u2013b1; from 8 and 9).\n\n\nGiven familiar Platonic doctrines and assumptions, the argument up to\nthe intermediate conclusion that the universe has a cause of its\nbecoming (7) presents no particular difficulties. But 7 by itself\ngives only partial support to\n 8.[13]\n Here it helps to anticipate 9d as a fundamental premise in\nTimaeus\u2019 reasoning; it is not just the generation of any world,\nbut that of a supremely beautiful one that Timaeus\u2019 reasoning\nhere\u2014and in fact throughout the discourse\u2014attempts to\nexplain. That a world as beautiful as ours might be the effect of an\nunintelligent cause is a possibility that Plato does not discuss.\n\nOnce the conclusion that the universe is teleologically structured is\nsettled, the explanatory methodology of the discourse proceeds\naccordingly. The question that frames the inquiry is not the question:\nWhat best explains this or that observed feature of the world? It is\nrather the question: Given that the world as a whole is the best\npossible one within the constraints of becoming and of Necessity, what\nsorts of features should we expect the world to have? This question\ninvites a priori answers, and Timaeus\u2019 arguments about the most\ngeneral features of the universe as a whole (for example, why it\nexists, why it is alive and intelligent, why it is unique, why it is\nshaped and composed as it is) are derived wholly a priori. The answers\nto these questions are not open to empirical confirmation. But clearly\nthe inquiry is also constrained by features of the universe that are\nactually observed, and this gives rise, secondly, to questions about\nthe good purposes that are being served by these features (for\nexample, the motions of the heavenly bodies, the psychophysical\nconstitutions of human beings, etc.), and how the features in question\naccomplish those purposes. For the most part there is a happy\ncoincidence between the features that are required (in answer to the\nfirst question), and the features that are actually observed (in\nanswer to the second), and it is part of the genius of the discourse\nthat these are so well woven together. Occasionally, however, the\nmethodology leads to conclusions apparently at odds with\nobservation\u2014for example, the exemption of earth from\ninter-elemental transformation (see further under\n\u201cPhysics\u201d\n below).[14]\n\nThe model that serves the Craftsman is regularly named the\n\u201cLiving Thing (Itself),\u201d and this is either a form, or an\nappropriately organized constellation of forms. It is the Ideal (or\nbetter: Real) Universe; the object of what Plato had called\n\u201creal astronomy\u201d (as opposed to empirical astronomy) in\nthe Republic (527d\u2013531d, esp. 530a3). The Craftsman\ndoes not\u2014indeed logically cannot\u2014copy by replicating the\nLiving Thing; his challenge rather lies in crafting an image of it\nthat is subject to the constraints of becoming: unlike the model, it\nmust be visible and tangible (28b7), hence three-dimensional\n(solid\u2014stereoeid\u00ea, 32b1). This constraint in turn\nrequires the postulation of something three-dimensional in\nwhich the created universe may subsist, what Timaeus initially\nnames the \u201creceptacle (hupodoch\u00ea) of all\nbecoming\u201d (49a5\u20136) and subsequently calls\n\u201cspace\u201d (ch\u00f4ra, 52a8, d3).\n\nThe imitative activity of the Craftsman, who forms the universe as an\nimitation of an eternal model, is unlike that of a builder who\nreplicates a larger- or smaller-scale three-dimensional structure as\nmodel, but like that of a builder who follows a set of instructions or\nschematics. That set is the intelligible, non-material and non-spatial\nmodel that prescribes the features of the structure to be built; it is\nnot a structure itself. It is a matter of debate whether Plato\u2019s\nmiddle-period metaphysics included the view that forms were, or\nexhibited, some grander, unalloyed version of some of the properties\nexhibited by sensible objects. Arguably such a view (call it\n\u201ccrude paradeigmatism\u201d) was refuted by the \u201cThird\nMan\u201d argument of the Parmenides (132a). As invisible,\nintangible, and non-spatial entities forms are excluded from\npossessing properties that only visible, tangible and spatial object\nmay possess. Nevertheless, in so far as they are or exhibit\nintelligible natures forms may, like a set of instructions or\nschematics, serve as models to be \u201clooked at\u201d (28a7, 29a3)\nby anyone who understands those natures and is in a position to\nconstruct a world in accordance with them. (This view of the\nCraftsman\u2019s imitative activity might by contrast be described as\n\u201crefined\n paradeigmatism.\u201d[15])\n",
