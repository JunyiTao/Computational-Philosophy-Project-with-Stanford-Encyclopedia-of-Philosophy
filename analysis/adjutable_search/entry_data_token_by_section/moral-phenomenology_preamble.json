    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes the term \u201cphenomenology\u201d is used to refer to the\nsubjective character of one\u2019s experiences or, as it is often\nglossed, their \u201cwhat-it\u2019s-likeness\u201d. Used in this\nway, one may, for instance, focus on the what-it\u2019s-likeness of a\nsharp pain one is currently experiencing and perhaps attempt to\ndescribe the subjective character of that pain\u2014its\nphenomenology. However, the term is also used as a label for a field\nof study, having a particular subject matter, methodology, and guiding\naim. This is how it will be used in this entry. Generally speaking,\nthen, moral phenomenology is a field of inquiry whose subject matter\nis moral experience in all its variety, whose aims are to provide\naccurate descriptions of such experience, guided by methods of\nfirst-person inquiry, and to explore the significance of moral\nphenomenology for select issues in metaethics and normative\nethics.\n\nThere are two dominant traditions within this field, one associated\nwith the phenomenological tradition initiated by Edmund Husserl, the\nother closely allied with work in the analytic philosophy of mind.\nThis entry will cover both traditions. Its aim is not to survey the\ndifferent moral theories proposed in the two traditions, but rather to\nprovide an account of the methodologies involved in moral\nphenomenology, to illustrate how these methodologies are applied in\nthe discussion of various types of moral experience, and to suggest\nways in which the results of these analyses address questions in\nmetaethics and normative ethics.\n",
