    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || God\u2019s knowledge of future contingent truths\n2.2 God\u2019s knowledge of future contingent truths\n\nIf T is true, there is still the question how God could come\nto believe T rather than not-T, and believe it\nwithout any possibility of error, given that T concerns the\ncontingent future. T is contingent only insofar as it is\nstill possible for you to refrain from answering the phone at 9\ntomorrow morning, though we\u2019re supposing for the sake of\nargument that you will answer the phone at 9. But then\nit\u2019s still possible for T to turn out false (though it\nwon\u2019t), and still possible for the belief that T to be\nincorrect (though it isn\u2019t). This is hard to square with the\nclaim in premise (1) that God\u2019s belief that T was\ninfallible.\n\nThis problem for infallible belief about a contingent future parallels\na problem for God\u2019s knowledge of a contingent future. Though the\nargument for theological fatalism rests only on divine belief rather\nthan knowledge (since the additional conditions for knowledge, beyond\ntrue belief, don\u2019t play any role in the argument), God\nnevertheless wouldn\u2019t believe without knowing. But it\u2019s\nunclear what could have been cognitively available to God yesterday,\nwhen your answering the phone at 9 am tomorrow was still future and\ncontingent, to raise his belief that T from a correct guess\nto genuine knowledge. Prior (1962) held this to be a further problem\nfor premise (1), beyond the nonexistence of future contingent truths.\nFor William Hasker (1989, 186\u201388), Richard Swinburne (2006,\n22\u201326), and Peter van Inwagen (2008), who maintain (contrary to\nPrior) that there are future contingent truths, the impossibility of\nforeknowing them is the problem with premise (1). This\n\u201climited foreknowledge\u201d view has been critiqued by Arbour\n(2013) and Todd (2014a), among others.\n\nDefenders of divine foreknowledge need something to say in response to\nskeptical questions about how such knowledge could be available to\nGod. One possible response is that it\u2019s a conceptual truth that\nGod is omniscient, and his knowledge, including his knowledge of\nfuture contingent truths, is simply innate (Craig 1987). Skeptics\nmight regard this response as closer to a non-response. But others\nhave offered detailed if speculative proposals. These include Ryan\nByerly (2014), whose book-length treatment of the issue grounds\nGod\u2019s infallible foreknowledge in a divine \u201cordering of\ntimes\u201d that is supposed to leave human free will intact.\n\nIt is relatively easy to see how God can know what is (contingently)\n\u201cgoing to\u201d happen if this refers to the present tendency\nof things. All it takes is exhaustive knowledge of the present. But\nwhat is \u201cgoing to\u201d happen can change, as the present\ntendency of things changes, and what God foreknows on this basis (his\nknowledge of what is going to happen) will change along with\nthis change in present tendencies. This \u201cmutable future\u201d\nposition, defended by Peter Geach, has been revived by Patrick Todd\n(2011, 2016b). On the \u201cGeachian\u201d view, God\u2019s beliefs\nabout the contingent future constitute genuine knowledge, because they\ntrack the changing truth about where the future is headed. What this\nview doesn\u2019t provide is the infallibility required by premise\n(1).\n\nFischer (2016, 31\u201345) tries to fill the gap with his\n\u201cboot-strapping\u201d account of divine foreknowledge. Even\nhuman beings are sometimes in a \u201cknowledge-conferring\nsituation,\u201d or KCS, with respect to the contingent future. Since\nGod would be aware of all the evidence and other knowledge-conferring\nfactors that human beings are aware of in such situations, God is in a\nposition to know (some) future contingents in the same way that human\nbeings can know them: by being in the appropriate KCS. But this\npresupposes a fallibilist theory of knowledge. What accounts for the\ninfallibility of God\u2019s beliefs? Fischer argues that God can\n\u201cbootstrap\u201d his way to certainty by combining his beliefs\nabout the contingent future with self-knowledge of his own\ninfallibility. Hunt (2017b) objects that the account is circular, and\nthat it couldn\u2019t support anything close to exhaustive\nforeknowledge, since most future contingent truths will lack\nKCS\u2019s at any given time. Fischer (2017, and forthcoming)\nelaborates and defends the view.\n\nThe most straightforward account of the matter, accommodating the\ninfallibility of God\u2019s beliefs, is that he simply\n\u201csees\u201d the future. If God is in time, this requires that\nhe be equipped with something like a \u201ctime telescope\u201d that\nallows him to view what is temporally distant. A hurdle faced by time\ntelescopes is that they probably involve retrocausation. If God is not\nin time, however, he wouldn\u2019t need a time telescope to view the\nfuture along with the present and past. This brings us to the next\nsolution.\n",
