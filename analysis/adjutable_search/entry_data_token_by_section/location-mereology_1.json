    "main_text": "Location || Which Location Relation is Fundamental?\n2.1 Which Location Relation is Fundamental?\n\nDebates about location have been framed in terms of two main\nlocational predicates: \u2018is exactly located at\u2019 and\n\u2018is weakly located at\u2019. Philosophers tend to agree about\nhow these predicates apply in particular cases, and they tend to agree\nthat one of these predicates should be taken as primitive and used to\ndefine the other. But there is disagreement about which to define and\nwhich to take as primitive. (Though certain exotic possibilities\ninvolving gunky objects (Leonard 2014) or extended simple regions\n(Kleinschmidt 2016) generate pressure to posit more than one\nfundamental location relation.)\n\nHere is a typical informal gloss for \u2018is exactly located\nat\u2019: an entity x is exactly located at a region y\nif and only if x has (or has-at-y) exactly the same\nshape and size as y and stands (or stands-at-y) in all\nthe same spatial or spatiotemporal relations to other entities as does\n y.[1]\n Thus, small cubes are exactly located only at small cubical regions,\nlarge spheres are exactly located only at large spherical regions, and\nso on (see Casati and Varzi 1999: 119\u2013120; Bittner, Donnelly,\nand Smith 2004; Gilmore 2006: 200\u2013202; Sattig 2006: 48).\n\nHere is a typical informal gloss for \u2018is weakly located\nat\u2019: an entity x is weakly located at a region y\nif and only if y is \u2018not completely free of\u2019\nx (Parsons 2007: 203). Thus I am weakly located at a certain\nregion, r, whose shape, size, and position perfectly match my\nown, I am weakly located at the bottom half of that region, I am\nweakly located at a certain much larger region, r+,\nthat has r as a proper part, and I am weakly located at a\ncertain scattered region, r*, that's made up of the bottom half\nof r together with a small region somewhere in Siberia. In\nshort, if r is the one and only region at which I am exactly\nlocated, then I am weakly located at just those regions that overlap\nr.\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates exact location and weak location. The dotted\nlines indicate regions\n(r1\u2013r5). The shaded circle\nindicates a disc-shaped object, d, that is located at regions.\nIn the diagram, d is exactly located at\nr4 but not at r1,\nr2, r3, or r5,\nand d is weakly located at r2,\nr3, r4, and r5\nbut not at r1.\n\nAssuming that we now grasp the intended relations, we are in a\nposition to consider proposals about how the associated predicates\nmight be defined. Suppose that we take \u2018x is exactly\nlocated at y\u2019 as primitive and symbolize it as\n\u2018L(x, y)\u2019 (Casati and Varzi 1999).\nThen, as Parsons (2007: 204) notes, the following definition of\n\u2018is weakly located at\u2019 (\u2018WKL\u2019) is\nnatural:\n\n(D9)\nWeak Location WKL(x,\ny)\n=df \u2203z[L(x,\nz) &\nO(z, y)]\n\n\u2018x is weakly located at y\u2019 means\n\u2018x has an exact location that overlaps\ny\u2019 \n\n\nOne consequence of (D9) is that the following principle\n\nExactness\n\u2200x\u2200y[WKL(x, y) \u2192\n\u2203zL(x, z)]\n\nIf a thing is weakly located somewhere, then it's exactly located\nsomewhere. \n\n\nis an analytic truth (Parsons 2007). This might be seen as a drawback,\nfor the following reason among others (Gilmore 2006: 203; Parsons\n2007: 207\u20139). One might think that the following situation is\npossible: (i) all regions are extended and gunky and decompose into\nsmaller (but still extended and still gunky) regions, (ii) some\nlocated entities are point-like and unextended, and (iii)entities are\nlocated only at regions. A point-like entity will be too small to be\nexactly located in any extended region, but it should still be weakly\nlocated at many regions\u2014in particular, at each in a series of\nnested regions that \u2018converge\u2019 on the point-like entity.\nSo, if it's possible that (i)\u2013(iii) are all true, then it's\npossible that, contrary to Exactness, a thing is weakly located\nsomewhere without being exactly located anywhere.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose that we take \u2018WKL\u2019 as\nprimitive. How might we use this predicate to define\n\u2018L\u2019? This is less obvious, but the definition that\nParsons (2007: 205) proposes is\n\n(D10) \nExact Location L(x,\ny)\n=df \u2200z[WKL(x,\nz)\n\u2194 O(y, z)]\n\n\u2018x is exactly located at y\u2019 means\n\u2018x is weakly located at all and only those entities that\noverlap y\u2019\n\n\nTo see how this definition works, return to the object d in\nFigure 1. We want it to turn out that d is exactly located at\nr4 and nowhere else. Given the natural assumptions\nabout which regions are parts of which, (D10) delivers the desired\nverdicts.\n\nFor example, (D10) tells us that d is not exactly located at\nr3, for the reason that r3\noverlaps certain regions (e.g., r1) at which\nd is not weakly located. In other words, r3\n\u2018overlaps regions it shouldn't\u2019. The situation with\nr5 is reversed. (D10) tells us that d is not\nexactly located at r5, for the reason that there are\nregions at which d is weakly located (e.g.,\nr2) that r5 does not\noverlap. In other words, r5 \u2018fails to overlap\nregions it should\u2019. Region r2 has both vices:\nit overlaps certain regions it shouldn't (e.g., its southeast corner),\nand it fails to overlap certain regions it should (e.g.,\nr5). Region r4 has neither vice.\nHence d counts as being exactly located at it, according to\n(D10).\n\nOne potential problem with (D10), however, is that it makes the\nfollowing principle\n\nQuasi-functionality\n\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z[(L(x,\ny) & L(x, z)) \u2192\nCO(y, z)]\n\nNothing has two different exact locations, unless those locations\nmereologically coincide with each other.\n\n\nan analytic truth. As we will see in\n Section 6,\n there are many who would deny Quasi-functionality, and there are\nothers who deny that it is necessary.\n\nIn the spirit of van Inwagen (1981), one might take the fundamental\nlocation relation to be lying-within, where this holds only between a\nsimple spacetime point, on the one hand, and a located entity, on the\nother. One might then define exact location in terms of it, as\nfollows: \u2018x is exactly located at y\u2019 means\nthe same as \u2018for any z, if z is simple, then:\nz lies within x if and only if z is a part of\ny\u2019. This has consequences similar to those of (D10). It\nhas the additional disadvantage that, in the context of gunky\nspacetime, it yields the result that everything is exactly located\neverywhere.\n\nIs it possible to do without any fundamental location relations? For\nsubstantivalists, there are two main strategies.\n\nFirst, there is the supersubstantivalist strategy.\nSupersubstantivalists say that each material object is identical to\nthe region that is its exact location. A first attempt at a\nsupersubstantivalist definition of exact location is this: for\nx to be exactly located at y is for x to be\nidentical to y. But this faces counterexamples involving\nabstract entities. The empty set is identical to itself but is not\nexactly located at itself. A natural repair invokes either the notion\nof a region (for those who are willing to say that all regions are\nexactly located at themselves) or the notion of a material object (for\nthose who are not): for x to be exactly located at y is\nfor x to be a region (alternatively: a material object) and\nidentical to y. Weak location can then be defined via (D9).\nThis account of exact location makes it hard to avoid full-blown\nMereological Harmony, as captured by (H1)\u2013(H8) below. (See\nSection 3.) As a result, every threat to Mereological Harmony,\nincluding the arguments for interpenetration, extended simples, and\nmutlilocation, is thereby a threat to the given account of exact\nlocation. But by the same token, one might argue that every instance\nof Mereological Harmony is explained by, and hence confirms, the\nsupersubstantivalist strategy.\n\nA variant of the supersubstantivalist strategy is available to those\nwho deny that located entities are identical to their locations,\nprovided that they are willing to say that those entities\nmereologically coincide with their locations. They can say that for\nx to be exactly located at y is for y to be a\nregion and for x to mereologically coincide with y\n(Hawthorne 2006: 118, note 18).\n\nSecond, there is the relativizing strategy. As noted above,\nsome philosophers hold that the fundamental parthood relation is\nthree-place or four-place, with the additional argument places\nreserved for locations of the part and/or the whole. For example, to\nallow for multilocation and mereological variation from one location\nto another, Gilmore (2014b: 21) suggests taking the predicate\n\u2018x at y is a part of z at w\u2019\nas primitive and using it to define \u2018x is exactly located\nat y\u2019, as \u2018for some z and some w:\neither x at y is a part of z at w or\nz at w is a part of x at y\u2019. The\ndefinition of the existence-at relation in Thomson (1983) is an\nearly example of this strategy. To keep things simple, however, we will\ncontinue to assume that the fundamental parthood relation is\ntwo-place. So we will set the relativizing strategy aside.\n",
