    "main_text": "Slow Switching Arguments || Reply 5: Anti-Recognitionalism\n4. Other Issues with Externalist Self-Knowledge\n\nThere is a surprising number of further issues regarding EXT and SK.\nSome of these consist in lesser-known incompatibilism arguments. For\ninstance, there is a kind of \u201cinverted\u201d memory argument\nsuggesting that, if Burge\u2019s self-verifying judgments count as\nbona fide self-knowledge, then one\u2019s memory would be infallible\nin ways that it is obviously not (Goldberg 2000b). In addition, it is\nsometimes argued that EXT and SK preclude the standard analysis of\nepistemic possibility. (Ebbs 2003; 2011. But see McLaughlin 2004.)\n\nQuestions about compatibility have been extended to more than just\nknowledge of content. There is also a case to be made that EXT\nprecludes armchair knowledge of one\u2019s attitudes toward\nthose contents (Bernecker 1996, Gibbons 2001). Thus, even if it is\nknown that you are currently thinking that water is scrumptious, EXT\nmay preclude armchair knowledge that you believe this. For\nwhat counts as \u201cbelief\u201d might vary according to\none\u2019s linguistic community. In addition, new issues have arisen\nin light of externalism about qualia (as held by Lycan 1987;\n1996; 2001, Dretske 1995, Tye 1995). Briefly, if a quale is partly\nindividuated by the subject\u2019s environment, then it seems one\ncould not know that one had a quale of fire engine red unless\none antecedently knew the actual color of fire engines. But since the\nlatter is not knowable from the armchair, then it seems neither is the\nformer (Levine 2003, Ellis 2007).\n\nAnother set of issues concerns the metaphysics of mind. Some have\nwondered if EXT and SK absurdly allow armchair knowledge of\nFodor\u2019s (1975) Language of Thought Hypothesis (Davies 1998).\nOthers have suggested that the Language of Thought Hypothesis\nfalsifies SK, assuming EXT (Boghossian 1989, p. 6, Bonjour 1991).\nFurther, some writers have worried that if one can know what one\nthinks, then one can know that one thinks. If so, then the\nability to armchair know one\u2019s own thoughts would too easily\nrefute eliminativism about the mental (Dretske 2003a; 2003b; 2004,\nBernecker 1998; 2004b, Jacob 2004, Parent 2017, ch. 9; some papers in\nSmithies & Stoljar 2012 are also relevant).\n\nIn addition, there is a burgeoning literature on whether EXT is\ncompatible with epistemic internalism, a view where knowledge or\njustification supervenes on what\u2019s in the head (Pritchard &\nKallestrup 2004, Brown 2007, Gerken 2008; also cf. Chase 2001,\nBrueckner 2002. Goldberg 2007a is germane too). Many of the issues\nhere turn on what kind of self-knowledge is allowed by EXT, and in\nparticular, whether such knowledge is discriminating enough for\njustificatory purposes.\n\nThe debate on externalism and self-knowledge should continue to see\nnew developments. After all, as one writer observes:\n\nin the last two decades several developments in the philosophy of\nmind, the philosophy of language, and epistemology make it worthwhile\nto reconsider semantic externalism\u2019s implications for\nself-knowledge...[T]hese developments include various versions of 2D\nsemantics, the emerging popularity of so-called transparency views of\nself-knowledge...various doctrines pertaining to the semantics of\n\u2018knows\u2019 (such as contextualism, contrastivism, and\npragmatic encroachment), a renewed focus on anti-luminosity arguments\n(deriving from the work of Williamson (2000)), and developments in the\nepistemology of testimony as well as in the epistemology of\nunderstanding. (Goldberg 2015b, pp. 7-8)\n Moreover, the externalism/self-knowledge debate seems\nnot to be just a short-lived fancy; instead, it is arguably a\nsignificant plot-point in the history of Western philosophy. This is\nbecause:\n\n\n[T]he issue reflects an important clash between philosophical\nparadigms before and after the linguistic (or conceptual) turn. On one\nhand, it is characteristic of Cartesianism that we can know contents\nintrospectively, independently of knowing the external world. On the\nother hand, Frege taught us that content determines which external\nobjects we refer to (or in Carnap\u2019s terminology, that intension\ndetermines extension). And as Putnam (1975, p. 218ff.) argues,\nFrege\u2019s idea seems to result in externalism: If content\ndetermines reference, then a difference in reference between\nOscar and Twin Oscar shows a difference in content. That seems to\nhold, even if their narrow psychological states are the same. So if\nFrege\u2019s view leads to externalism, yet this precludes Cartesian\nknowledge of content, then apparently one of these\nparadigm-defining ideas has to go. Either Cartesians were wrong\nto say we can know contents just by introspection, or Fregeans were\nmisguided to think that content is what determines reference. (Parent\n2015b, p. 1346)\n The debate on whether EXT is compatible with SK thus\ndeserves our continued, serious attention.\n",
