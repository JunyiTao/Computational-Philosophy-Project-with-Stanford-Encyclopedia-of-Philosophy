    "main_text": "Critiques of operationalism || Operational definitions do not exhaust meaning\n2.1 Operational definitions do not exhaust meaning\n\nNowhere was the positivist disappointment with Bridgman sharper than\nin considerations of operationalism as a theory of meaning. There was\na set of objections which together amounted to a complaint that\noperational definitions did not give a sufficient account of the\nmeaning of concepts, even where there were operations clearly relevant\nto the concepts in question.\n\nThe core of the problem here is an overly restrictive notion of\nmeaning, which reduces it to measurement; I will call this\nBridgman\u2019s reductive doctrine of meaning. Although\nBridgman was not proposing a general philosophical theory of meaning,\nhe did make remarks that revealed an impulse to do so. Consider the\nfollowing statement, the last part of which I have already quoted:\n\nWe evidently know what we mean by length if we can tell what the\nlength of any and every object is, and for the physicist nothing more\nis required. To find the length of an object, we have to perform\ncertain physical operations. The concept of length is therefore fixed\nwhen the operations by which length is measured are fixed: that is,\nthe concept of length involves as much as and nothing more than the\nset of operations by which length is determined. In general, we mean\nby any concept nothing more than a set of operations; the concept is\nsynonymous with the corresponding set of operations. (Bridgman 1927,\n5)\n\n\nSimilarly, he also displayed an impulse to use operations to make a\ncriterion of meaningfulness: \u201cIf a specific question has\nmeaning, it must be possible to find operations by which an answer may\nbe given to it.\u201d (Bridgman 1927, 28)\n\nOne lesson we can take from Bridgman\u2019s troubles is that meaning\nis unruly and promiscuous. The kind of absolute control on the meaning\nof scientific concepts that Bridgman wished for is not possible. The\nmost control that can be achieved is for the scientific community to\nagree on an explicit definition and to respect it. But even firm\ndefinitions can only constrain the uses of a concept. The entire world\ncan agree to define length by the standard meter in Paris (or by the\nwavelength of a certain atomic radiation), and that still comes\nnowhere near exhausting all that we mean by length. Bridgman\nhimself later specifically admitted that his statement that meanings\nwere synonymous with operations was \u201cobviously going too far\nwhen taken out of context\u201d (1938, 117). Especially compared with\nthe notion of \u201cmeaning as use,\u201d often traced back to the\nlater phase of Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s\n work,[3]\n it is easy to recognize the narrowness of Bridgman\u2019s initial\nideas. Bridgman\u2019s later gloss on his ideas was in fact rather\nlate-Wittgensteinian: \u201cTo know the meaning of a term used by me\nit is evident, I think, that I must know the conditions under which I\nwould use the term\u201d (1938, 116). As measurement operations\nprovide only one specific context in which a concept is used,\noperational definitions can only cover one particular aspect of\nmeaning.\n\nRecognizing the restrictiveness of Bridgman\u2019s early remarks on\nmeaning gives us a useful framework for understanding one common\nobjection to operationalism. As Donald Gillies (1972, 6\u20137)\nemphasizes, if we accept the most extreme kind of operationalism,\nthere is no point in asking whether a measurement method is valid; if\nthe measurement method defines the concept and there is nothing more\nto the meaning of the concept, the measurement method is automatically\nvalid, as a matter of convention or even tautology. Metrological\nvalidity becomes an interesting question only if the concept possesses\na broader meaning than the specification of the method of its\nmeasurement. Not only Bridgman himself but the second-generation\noperationist psychologists recognized this point very clearly, in\ntheir discussions of construct validity (see, for example, Cronbach\nand Meehl 1955). The measurement method can be said to be valid if it\ncoheres with the other aspects of the concept\u2019s meaning. That\nway we may also make a judgment about whether an operational\ndefinition (or any other kind of definition) is an appropriate one,\ndepending on how well it coheres with other elements of the\nconcept\u2019s meaning and how beneficially it controls other\nelements of meaning.\n",
