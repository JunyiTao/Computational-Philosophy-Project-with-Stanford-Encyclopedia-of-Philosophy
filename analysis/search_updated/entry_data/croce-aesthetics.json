    "preamble": "\n\nThe Neapolitan Benedetto Croce (1860\u20131952) was a dominant figure\nin the first half of the twentieth century in aesthetics and literary\ncriticism, and to lesser but not inconsiderable extent in philosophy\ngenerally. But his fame did not last, either in Italy or in the\nEnglish speaking world. He did not lack promulgators and willing\ntranslators into English: H. Carr was an early example of the former,\nR. G. Collingwood was perhaps both, and D. Ainslie did the latter\nservice for most of Croce\u2019s principal works. But his star\nrapidly declined after the Second World War. Indeed it is hard to find\na figure whose reputation has fallen so far and so quickly; this is\nsomewhat unfair not least because Collingwood\u2019s aesthetics is\nstill studied, when its many of its main ideas are often thought to\nhave been borrowed from Croce. The causes are a matter for\nspeculation, but two are likely. First, Croce\u2019s general\nphilosophy was very much of the preceding century. As the idealistic\nand historicist systems of Bradley, Green, and Joachim were in Britain\nsuperseded by Russell, Moore and Ayer, and analytical philosophy in\ngeneral, Croce\u2019s system was swept away by new ideas on the\ncontinent\u2014from Heidegger and Sartre on the one hand to\ndeconstructionism on the other. Second, Croce\u2019s manner of\npresentation in his famous early works now seems, not to put too fine\na point on it, dismissively dogmatic; it is full of the youthful\nconviction and fury that seldom wears well. On certain key points,\nopposing positions are characterized as foolish, or as confused\nexpressions of simple truths that only waited upon Croce to articulate\nproperly (yet his later exchange with John Dewey\u2014see Croce 1952,\nDouglas 1970, Vittorio 2012\u2014finds him more earnestly\naccountable). Of course, these dismissals carry some\nweight\u2014Croce\u2019s reading is prodigious and there is far more\ninsight beneath the words than initially meets the eye\u2014but\nunless the reader were already convinced that here at last is the\ntruth, their sheer number and vehemence will arouse mistrust. And\nsince the early works, along with his long running editorship of the\njournal La Critica, rocketed him to such fame and admiration,\nwhereas later years were devoted among other things to battling with\nwhile being tolerated by fascists, it\u2019s not surprising that he\nnever quite lost this habit.\n\nNevertheless, Croce\u2019s signal contribution to aesthetics\u2014an\ninteresting new angle on the idea that art is expression\u2014can be\nmore or less be detached from the surrounding philosophy and polemics.\nIn what follows, we will first see the doctrine as connected to its\noriginal philosophical context, then we will attempt to snip the\nconnections.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Four Domains of Spirit (or Mind)\n\nWe are confining ourselves to Croce\u2019s aesthetics, but it will\nhelp to have at least the most rudimentary sketch in view of his\nrather complex general philosophy.\n\nIn Italy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the prevailing\nphilosophy or \u2018world-view\u2019 was not, as in England,\npost-Hegelian Idealism as already mentioned, but the early forms of\nempiricist positivism associated with such figures as Comte and Mach.\nPartly out of distaste for the mechanism and enshrinement of matter of\nsuch views, and partly out of his reaction, both positive and\nnegative, to the philosophy of Hegel, Croce espoused what he called\n\u2018Absolute Idealism\u2019 or \u2018Absolute Historicism\u2019.\nA constant theme in Croce\u2019s philosophy is that he sought a path\nbetween the Scylla of \u2018transcendentalism\u2019 and the\nCharybdis of \u2018sensationalism\u2019, which for most purposes may\nbe thought of as co-extensive with rationalism and empiricism. For\nCroce, they are bottom the same error, the error of abstracting from\nordinary experience to something not literally experienceable.\nTranscendentalism regards the world of sense to be unreal, confused or\nsecond-rate, and it is the philosopher, reflecting on the world in\na priori way from his armchair, who sees beyond it, to\nreality. What Croce called \u2018Sensationalism\u2019, on the other\nhand, regards only instantaneous impressions of colour and the like as\nexisting, the rest being in some sense a mere logical construction out\nof it, of no independent reality. The right path is what Croce calls\nimmanentism: All but only lived human experience, taking\nplace concretely and without reduction, is real. Therefore all\nPhilosophy, properly so-called, is Philosophy of Spirit (or Mind), and\nis inseparable from history. And thus Croce\u2019s favoured\ndesignations, \u2018Absolute Idealism\u2019 or \u2018Absolute\nHistoricism\u2019.\n\nPhilosophy admits of the following divisions, corresponding to the\ndifferent modes of mental or spiritual activity. Mental activity is\neither theoretic (it understands or contemplates) or it is practical\n(it wills actions). These in turn divide: The theoretic divides into\nthe aesthetic, which deals in particulars (individuals or intuitions),\nand logic or the intellectual domain, which deals in concepts and\nrelations, or universals. The practical divides into the\neconomic\u2014by which Croce means all manner of utilitarian\ncalculation\u2014and the ethical or moral. Each of the four domains\nare subject to a characteristic norm or value: aesthetic is subject to\nbeauty, logic is subject to truth, economic is subject to the useful\n(or vitality), and the moral is subject to the good. Croce devoted\nthree lengthy books written between 1901 and 1909 to this overall\nscheme of the \u2018Philosophy of Spirit\u2019: Aesthetic\n(1901) and (1907) (revised), Logic (1909) and the\nPhilosophy of the Practical (1908), the latter containing\nboth the economic and ethics (in today\u2019s use of term you might\ncall the overall scheme Croce\u2019s metaphysics, but Croce\nhimself distanced himself from that appellation; there is also some\nsense in calling it philosophy of mind).\n2. The Primacy of the Aesthetic\n\nPhilosophers since Kant customarily distinguish intuitions or\nrepresentations from concepts or universals. In one sense Croce\nfollows this tradition, but another sense his view departs radically.\nFor intuitions are not blind without concepts; an intuitive\npresentation (an \u2018intuition\u2019) is a complete conscious\nmanifestation just as it is, in advance of applying concepts (and all\nthat is true a priori of them is that they have a particular\ncharacter or individual physiognomy\u2014they are not necessarily\nspatial or temporal, contra Kant). To account for this, Croce\nsupposes that the modes of mental activity are in turn arranged at\ndifferent levels. The intellect presupposes the intuitive\nmode\u2014which just is the aesthetic\u2014but the intuitive mode\ndoes not presuppose the intellect. The intellect\u2014issuing in\nparticular judgements\u2014in turn is presupposed by the practical,\nwhich issues among other things in empirical laws. And morality tells\nthe practical sciences what ends in particular they should pursue.\nThus Croce regarded this as one of his key insights: All mental\nactivity, which means the whole of reality, is founded on the\naesthetic, which has no end or purpose of its own, and of course no\nconcepts or judgements. This includes the concept of existence or\nreality: the intuition plus the judgement of existence is what Croce\ncalls perception, but itself is innocent of it.\n\nTo say the world is essentially history is to say that at the lowest\nlevel it is aesthetic experiences woven into a single fabric, a\nworld-narrative, with the added judgement that it is real, that it\nexists. Croce takes this to be inevitable: the subjective present is\nreal and has duration; but any attempt to determine its exact size is\nsurely arbitrary. Therefore the only rigorous view is that the past is\nno less real than the present. History then represents, by definition,\nthe only all-encompassing account of reality. What we call the natural\nsciences then are impure, second-rate. Consider for example the\nconcept of a space-time point. Plainly it is not something\nanyone has ever met with in experience; it is an abstraction,\npostulated as a limit of certain operations for the convenience of a\n\u2018theory\u2019. Croce would call it a pseudo-concept, and would\nnot call the so-called \u2018empirical laws\u2019 in which it\nfigures to be fit subjects for truth and knowledge. Its significance,\nlike that of other pseudo-concepts, is pragmatic.\n\nIn fact the vast majority of concepts\u2014house, reptile,\ntree\u2014are mere adventitious collections of things that are\nformulated in response to practical needs, and thus cannot, however\nexact the results of the corresponding science, attain to truth or\nknowledge. Nor do the concepts of mathematics escape the\n\u2018pseudo\u2019 tag. What Croce calls pure concepts, in contrast,\nare characterised by their possession of expressiveness, universality\nand concreteness, and they perform their office by a priori\nsynthesis (this accounts for character mentioned above). What\nthis means it that everything we can perceive or imagine\u2014every\nrepresentation or intuition\u2014will necessarily have all three:\nthere is no possible experience that is not of something concrete,\nuniversal in the sense of being an instance of something absolutely\ngeneral, and expressive, that is, admitting of verbal enunciation.\nEmpirical concepts, then, like heat, are concrete but not\nuniversal; mathematical concepts, like number, are universal\nbut not concrete. Examples of pure concepts are rare, but those\nrecognized by Croce are finality, quality and\nbeauty. Such is the domain of Logic, in Croce\u2019s\nscheme.\n\nA critical difference, for our purposes, between Croce\u2019s ideas\nand those of his apparent follower Collingwood, emerges when we ask:\nwhat are the constituents of the intuition? For\nCollingwood\u2014writing in the mid-1930s\u2014intuitions are built\nup out of sense-data, the only significant elaboration of\nRussell\u2019s doctrine being that sense-data are never simple,\ncomprising what analysis reveals as sensory and affective\nconstituents. For Croce the intuition is an organic whole, such that\nto analyze it into atoms is always a false abstraction: the intuition\ncould never be re-built with such elements. (Although a deadly\nopponent of formal logic, Croce did share Frege\u2019s insight that\nthe truly meaningful bit of language is the sentence; \u2018only in\nthe context of sentence does a word have a meaning\u2019, wrote Frege\nin 1884).\n3. Art and Aesthetics\n\nWith such an account of \u2018the aesthetic\u2019 in view, one might\nthink that Croce intends to cover roughly the same ground as\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic, and like Kant will think of art\nas a comparatively narrow if profound region of experience. But Croce\ntakes the opposite line (and finds Kant\u2019s theory of beauty and\nart to have failed at precisely this point): art is everywhere, and\nthe difference between ordinary intuition and that of \u2018works of\nart\u2019 is only a quantitative difference\n(Aes.13). This principle has for Croce a profound\nsignificance:\n\nWe must hold firmly to our identification, because among the principal\nreasons which have prevented Aesthetic, the science of art, from\nrevealing the true nature of art, its real roots in human nature, has\nbeen its separation from the general spiritual life, the having made\nof it a sort of special function or aristocratic club\u2026. There\nis not \u2026 a special chemical theory of stones as distinct from\nmountains. In the same way, there is not a science of lesser intuition\nas distinct from a science of greater intuition, nor one of ordinary\nintuition as distinct from artistic intuition. (Aes. 14)\n\n\nBut the point is not that every object is to some degree a work of\nart. The point is that every intuition has to some degree the\nqualities of the intuition of a work of art; it\u2019s just that the\nintuition of a work of art has them in much greater degree.\n4. Intuition and Expression\n\nWe now reach the most famous and notorious Crocean doctrine concerning\nart. \u2018To intuit\u2019, he writes, \u2018is to express\u2019\n(Aes. 11); \u2018intuitive knowledge is expressive\nknowledge\u2019. There are several points that have to be in place in\norder to understand what Croce means by this, because it obviously\ndoes not strike one as initially plausible.\n4.1 The Double Ideality of the Work of Art\n\nFor our purposes, it is simplest to regard Croce as an idealist, for\nwhom there is nothing besides the mind. So in that sense, the work of\nart is an ideal or mental object along with everything else; no\nsurprise there, but no interest either. But he still maintains the\nordinary commonplace distinction between mental things\u2014thoughts,\nhopes and dreams\u2014and physical things\u2014tables and trees. And\non this divide, the work of art, for Croce, is still\na mental thing. In other words, the work of art in doubly\nideal; to put it another way, even if Croce were a\ndualist\u2014or a physicalist with some means of reconstructing\nthe physical-mental distinction\u2014the work of art would remain\nmental. In what follows, then, except where otherwise noted, we shall\ntreat Croce is being agnostic as between idealism, physicalism, or\ndualism (see PPH 227).\n\nThis claim about the ontological status of works of art means that a\nspectator \u2018of\u2019 a work of art\u2014a sonata, a poem, a\npainting\u2014is actually creating the work of art in his mind.\nCroce\u2019s main argument for this is the same as, therefore no\nbetter but no worse than, Russell\u2019s argument from the relativity\nof perception to sense-data. The perceived aesthetic qualities of\nanything vary with the states of the perceiver; therefore in speaking\nof the former we are really speaking of the latter (Aes. 106;\nCroce does not, it seems, consider the possibility that certain states\nof the perceiver might be privileged, but it is evident that he would\ndiscount this possibility). Now the Crocean formulation\u2014to\nintuit is to express\u2014perhaps begins to make sense. For\n\u2018intuition\u2019 is in some sense a mental act, along\nwith its near-cognates \u2018representation\u2019,\n\u2018imagination\u2019,\n\u2018invention\u2019,\u2018vision\u2019, and\n\u2018contemplation.\u2019 Being a mental act, something we do, it\nis not a mere external object.\n4.2 The Role of Feeling\n\nFeeling, for Croce, is necessarily part of any (mental)\nactivity, including bare perception\u2014indeed, feeling is\na form of mental activity (it is part of his philosophy that there is\nnever literally present to consciousness anything passive). We are\naccustomed to thinking of \u2018artistic expression\u2019 as\nconcerned with specific emotions that are relatively rare in the\nmental life, but again, Croce points out that strictly speaking, we\nare thinking of a quantitative distinction as qualitative. In fact\nfeeling is nothing but the will in mental activity, with all its\nvarieties of thought, desire and action, its varieties of frustration\nand satisfaction (Aes. 74\u20136). The only criterion of\n\u2018art\u2019 is coherence of expression, of the movement of the\nwill (for a comparison with Collingwood\u2019s similar doctrine, see\nKemp 2003: 173\u20139).\n\nBecause of this, Croce discounts certain aesthetic applications of the\ndistinction between form and content as confused. The distinction only\napplies at a theoretical level, to a posited a priori\nsynthesis (EA 39\u201340). At that level, the irruption of\nan intuition just is the emergence of a form (we are right to\nspeak of the formation of intuition, that intuitions are\nformed). At the aesthetic level\u2014one might say at the\nphenomenological level\u2014there is no identification of content\nindependently of the forms in which we meet it, and none of form\nindependently of content. It makes no sense to speak of a work of\nart\u2019s being good on form but poor on content, or good on content\nbut poor on form.\n4.3 Feeling, Expression and the Commonplace\n\nWhen Croce says that intuition and expression are the same phenomenon,\nwe are likely to think: what does this mean for a person who cannot\ndraw or paint, for example? Even if we allow Croce his widened notion\nof feeling, surely the distinction between a man who looks at a bowl\nof fruit but cannot draw or paint it, and the man who does draw or\npaint it, is precisely that of a man with a Crocean intuition but who\ncannot express it, and one who has both. How then can expression\nbe intuition?\n\nCroce comes at this concern from both sides. On one side, there is\n\u2018the illusion or prejudice that we possess a more complete\nintuition of reality than we really do\u2019 (Aes. 9). We\nhave, most of the time, only fleeting, transitory intuitions amidst\nthe bustle of our practical lives. \u2018The world which as rule we\nintuit is a small thing\u2019, he writes; \u2018It consists of small\nexpressions \u2026 it is a medley of light and colour\u2019\n(Aes. 9). On the other side, if our man is seriously focussed\non the bowl of fruit, it is only a prejudice to deny that then he is\nto that extent expressing himself\u2014although, according to Croce,\nordinary direct perception of things, as glimpsed in photography, will\ngenerally be lacking the \u2018lyrical\u2019 quality that genuine\nartists give to their works (though this particular twist is a later\naddition; see section 9 below).\n5. Natural Expression, Beauty and Hedonic Theory\n\nThere is another respect in which Croce\u2019s notion of expression\nas intuition departs from what we ordinarily think of in connection\nwith the word \u2018expression\u2019. For example we think\nunreflectively of wailing as a natural expression of pain or grief;\ngenerally, we think of expressive behaviour or gestures as being\ncaused, at least paradigmatically, by the underlying emotion or\nfeelings. But Croce joins a long line of aestheticians in attempting a\nsharp distinction between this phenomenon and expression in art.\nWhereas the latter is the subject of aesthetics, the former is a topic\nfor the natural sciences\u2014\u2018for instance in Darwin\u2019s\nenquiries into the expression of feeling in man and in the\nanimals\u2019 (PPH 265; cf. Aes. 21, 94\u20137).\nIn an article he wrote for the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\nspeaking of such \u2018psychophysical phenomena\u2019, he\nwrites:\n\n\u2026such \u2018expression\u2019, albeit conscious, can rank as\nexpression only by metaphorical licence, when compared with the\nspiritual or aesthetic expression which alone expresses, that is to\nsay gives to the feeling a theoretical form and converts into\nlanguage, song, shape. It is in the difference between feeling as\ncontemplated (poetry, in fact), and feeling as enacted or undergone,\nthat lies the catharsis, the liberation from the affections, the\ncalming property which has been attributed to art; and to this\ncorresponds the aesthetic condemnation of works of art if, or in so\nfar as, immediate feeling breaks into them or uses them as an outlet.\n(PPH 219).\n\n\nCroce is no doubt right to want to distinguish these things, but\nwhether his official position\u2014that expression is identical to\nintuition\u2014will let him do so is another matter; he does not\nactually analyze the phenomena in such a way as to deduce, with the\nhelp of his account of expression, the result. He simply asserts it.\nBut we will wait for our final section to articulate criticisms.\n\nCroce\u2019s wish to divorce artistic expression from natural\nexpression is partly driven by his horror at naturalistic theories of\nart. The same goes for his refusal to rank pleasure as the\naim, or at least an aim, of art (Aes. 82\u20136). He does\nnot of course deny that aesthetic pleasures (and pains) exist, but\nthey are \u2018the practical echo of aesthetic value and\ndisvalue\u2019 (Aes. 94). Strictly speaking, they are dealt\nwith in the Philosophy of the Practical, that is, in the theory of the\nwill, and do not enter into the theory of art. That is, if the\ndefining value of the Aesthetic is beauty, the defining value\nof the Practical is usefulness. In the Essence of\nAesthetic (EA 11\u201313) Croce points out that the\npleasure is much wider than the domain of art, so a definition of art\nas \u2018what causes pleasure\u2019 will not do. Croce does speak of\nthe \u2018truly aesthetic pleasure\u2019 had in beholding the\n\u2018aesthetic fact\u2019 (Aes. 80). But perhaps he is\nbeing consistent. The pragmatic pleasure had in beholding beauty is\nonly contingently aroused, but in point of fact it always is aroused\nby such beholding, because the having of an intuition is an act of\nmind, and therefore the will is brought into play.\n6. Externalization\n\nThe painting of pictures, the scrape of the bow upon strings, the\nchanting or inscription of a poem are, for Croce, only contingently\nrelated to the work of art, that is, to the expressed intuition. By\nthis Croce does not mean to say that for example the painter could get\nby without paint in point of fact; the impossibility of say the\nexistence of Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper without his having\nput paint on the wall of Santa Maria delle Grazie not an impossibility\nin principle, but it is a factual impossibility, like that of a man\njumping to the Moon. What he is doing is always driven by the\nintuition, and thereby making it possible for others to have the\nintuition (or rather, an intuition). First, the\nmemory\u2014though only contingently\u2014often requires the\nphysical work to sustain or develop the intuition. Second, the\nphysical work is necessary for the practical business of the\ncommunication of the intuition.\n\nFor example the process of painting is a closely interwoven operation\nof positive feedback between the intuitive faculty and the practical\nor technical capacity to manipulate the brush, mix paint and so\non:\n\nLikewise with the painter, who paints upon canvas or upon wood, but\ncould not paint at all, did not the intuited image, the line and\ncolour as they have taken shape in the fancy, precede, at\nevery stage of the work, from the first stroke of the brush or sketch\nof the outline to the finishing touches, the manual actions. And when\nit happens that some stroke of the brush runs ahead of the image, the\nartist, in his final revision, erases and corrects it.\n\n\nIt is, no doubt, very difficult to perceive the frontier between\nexpression and communication in actual fact, for the two processes\nusually alternate rapidly and are almost\nintermingled. But the distinction is ideally clear and must\nbe strongly maintained\u2026 The technical does not enter into art,\nbut pertains to the concept of communication. (PPH\n227\u20138, emphasis added; cf. Aes. 50\u20131, 96\u20137,\n103, 111\u201317; EA 41\u20137)\n\n\nHe also defines technique as \u2018knowledge at the service of the\npractical activity directed to producing stimuli to aesthetic\nreproduction\u2019 (Aes. 111). Again, we defer criticism to\nthe conclusion.\n7. Judgement, Criticism and Taste\n\nThe first task of the spectator of the work of art\u2014the\ncritic\u2014is for Croce simple: one is to reproduce the intuition,\nor perhaps better, one is to realize the intuition, which is\nthe work of art. One may fail, and Croce is well aware that one may be\nmistaken; \u2018haste, vanity, want of reflexion, theoretic\nprejudices\u2019 may bring it about that one finds beautiful what is\nnot, or fail to find beautiful what is (Aes. 120). But given\nthe foregoing strict distinction between practical technique and\nartistic activity properly so-called, his task is the same as that\nof the artist:\n\nHow could that which is produced by a given activity be judged a\ndifferent activity? The critic may be a small genius, the\nartist a great one \u2026 but the nature of both must remain the\nsame. To judge Dante, we must raise ourselves to his level: let it be\nwell understood that empirically we are not Dante, nor Dante we; but\nin that moment of contemplation and judgement, our spirit is one with\nthat of the poet, and in that moment we and he are one thing.\n(Aes. 121)\n\n\nLeave aside the remark that we become identical with the poet. If by\ntaste we mean the capacity for aesthetic judgement\u2014that is, the\ncapacity to find beauty\u2014and by genius we mean the capacity to\nproduce beauty, then they are the same: the capacity to realize\nintuitions.\n\nIn Croce\u2019s overall philosophy, the aesthetic stands alone: in\nhaving an intuition, one has succeeded entirely insofar as aesthetic\nvalue is concerned. Therefore there cannot be a real question of a\n\u2018standard\u2019 of beauty which an object might or might not\nsatisfy. Thus Croce says:\n\n\u2026the criterion of taste is absolute, but absolute in a\ndifferent way from that of the intellect, which expresses itself in\nratiocination. The criterion of taste is absolute, with the intuitive\nabsoluteness of the imagination. (Aes. 122)\n\n\nOf course there is as a matter of fact a great deal of variability in\ncritical verdicts. But Croce believes this is largely due to variances\nin the \u2018psychological conditions\u2019 and the physical\ncircumstance of spectators (Aes. 124). Much of this can be\noffset by \u2018historical interpretation\u2019 (Aes. 126);\nthe rest, one presumes, are due to disturbances already mentioned:\n\u2018haste, vanity, want of reflexion, theoretic prejudices\u2019\n(Aes. 120). Also one must realize that for Croce, all that\nSibley famously characterized as aesthetic concepts\u2014not just\ngracefulness, delicacy and so on but only aesthetically negative\nconcepts like ugliness\u2014are really variations on the over-arching\nmaster-concept beauty.\n8. The Identity of Art and Language\n\nThe title of the first great book of Croce\u2019s career was\n\u2018Aesthetic as a Science of expression and general\nlinguistic\u2019 (emphasis added). There are several\ninterconnected aspects to this.\n\nCroce claims that drawing, sculpting, writing of music and so on are\njust as much \u2018language\u2019 as poetry, and all\nlanguage is poetic; therefore \u2018Philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of art are the same thing\u2019 (Aes. 142;\nauthor\u2019s emphasis). The reason for this is that language is to\nbe understood as expressive; \u2018an emission of sounds which\nexpresses nothing is not language\u2019 (Aes. 143). From our\nperspective, we might regard Croce as arguing thus: (1) Referential\nsemantics\u2014scarcely mentioned by Croce\u2014necessarily involves\nparts of speech. (2) However:\n\nIt is false to say that a verb or noun is expressed in definite words,\ntruly distinguishable from others. Expression is an indivisible whole.\nNoun and verb do not exist in it, but are abstractions made by us,\ndestroying the sole linguistic reality, which is the\nsentence. (Aes. 146)\n\n\nIf we take this as asserting the primacy of sentence\nmeaning\u2014glossing over the anti-abstraction remark which is\ntantamount to a denial of syntactic compositionality\u2014then\ntogether with (3) a denial of what in modern terms would be\ndistinction between semantic and expressive meaning, or perhaps in\nFregean terms sense and tone, then it is not obvious that the\nresulting picture of language would not apply equally to, for example,\ndrawing. In that case, just as drawings cannot be translated, so\nlinguistic translation is impossible (though for certain purposes,\nnaturally, we can translate \u2018relatively\u2019; Aes.\n68).\n\nInterestingly, Croce does not think of all signs as natural\nsigns, as lightning is a sign of thunder; on the contrary, he thinks\nof \u2018pictures, poetry and all works of art\u2019 as equally\nconventional\u2014as \u2018historically conditioned\u2019\n(Aes. 125; authors emphasis).\n\nThere is no doubt that on this point Croce was inspired by his great\nprecursor, the Neapolitan Giambattista Vico (1668\u20131744).\nAccording to Croce (Aes. 220\u201334) Vico was the first to\nrecognise the aesthetic as a self-sufficient and non-conceptual mode\nof knowledge, and famously he held that all language is substantially\npoetry. The only serious mistake in this that Croce found was\nVico\u2019s belief in an actual historical period when all language\nwas poetry; it was the mistake of substituting a concrete history for\n\u2018ideal history\u2019 (Aes. 232).\n9. Later Developments\n\nAs he became older, there was one aspect of his aesthetics that he was\nuneasy with. In the Aesthetic of 1901 (Aes.\n82\u20137, 114), and again in Essence of Aesthetic of 1913\n(EA 13\u201316) , he had been happy to deduce from his\ntheory that art cannot have an ethical purpose. The only value in art\nis beauty. But by 1917, in the essay The Totality of Artistic\nExpression (PPH 261\u201373), his attitude towards the\nmoral content of art is more nuanced. This may have been only a shift\nof emphasis, or, charitably perhaps, drawing out a previously\nunnoticed implication: \u2018If the ethical principle is a cosmic\n[universal] force (as it certainly is) and queen of the world, the\nworld of liberty, she reigns in her own right, while art, in\nproportion to the purity with which she re-enacts and expresses the\nmotions of reality, is herself perfect\u2019 (PPH 267). In\nother words, he still holds that to speak of a moral work of art would\nnot impinge upon it aesthetically; likewise to speak of an\nimmoral work, for the values of the aesthetic and moral\ndomains are absolutely incommensurable. It is not merely an\nassertion that within the domain of pure intuition, the\nconcepts simply don\u2019t apply; that would merely beg the question.\nHe means that a pure work of art cannot be subject to moral\npraise or blame because the Aesthetic domain exists independently of\nand prior, in the Philosophy of Spirit, to the Ethical.\n\nIn the Encyclopaedia article of 1928, Croce asserts positively that\nthe moral sensibility is a necessary condition of the artist:\n\nThe foundation of all poetry is therefore the human personality, and\nsince the human personality fulfills itself morally, the foundation of\nall poetry is the moral conscience. (PPH 221)\n\n\nStill it\u2019s possible to read him as not having changed his view.\nFor instance, Shakespeare could not have been Shakespeare without\nseeing into the moral heart of man, for morality is the highest domain\nof spirit. But we have to distinguish between the moral\nsensibility\u2014the capacity to perceive and feel moral\nemotions\u2014and the capacity to act morally. Croce\u2019s position\nis that only the first is relevant to art.\n\nThe early emphasis on beauty is downplayed in subsequent writing in\nfavour of the successful work art as expression, as constituting a\n\u2018lyrical intuition\u2019. In Essence of Aesthetic he\nwrites:\n\n\u2026what gives coherence and unity to the intuition is feeling:\nthe intuition is really such because it represents a feeling, and can\nonly appear from and upon that. Not the idea, but the feeling, is what\nconfers upon art the airy lightness of a symbol: an aspiration\nenclosed in the circle of a representation\u2014that is art; and in\nit the aspiration alone stands for the representation, and the\nrepresentation alone for the aspiration. (EA 30)\n\n\nCroce still holds that art is intuitive, a-logical or nonconceptual,\nand therefore by \u2018it represents a feeling\u2019 he does not\nmean that our aesthetic mode of engagement involves that concept, and\nhe does not mean that art is to be understood as symbolic, implying a\nrelation which would require an intellectual act of mind to apprehend.\nBoth would imply that our mode of aesthetic engagement would be\nsomething more, or something other than, the aesthetic, which is as\nalways the intuitive capacity. The point is simply that our awareness\nof the form of the intuition in nothing but our awareness of the\nunifying currents of feeling running through it. It is a claim about\nwhat it is that unifies an intuition, distinguishes it from the\nsurrounding, relatively discontinuous or confused intuition. This is,\nin effect, a claim about the nature of beauty:\n\nAn appropriate expression, if appropriate, is also beautiful, beauty\nbeing nothing but the precision of the image, and therefore of the\nexpression. \u2026(EA 48).\n\n\nExpression and beauty are not two concepts, but a single concept,\nwhich it is permissible to designate with either synonymous word\n\u2026 (EA 49).\n\n\nGenuinely new in the 1917 essay was Croce\u2019s appealing but\nenigmatic claim that art is in a sense \u2018universal\u2019, is\nconcerned with the \u2018totality\u2019:\n\nTo give artistic form to a content of feeling means, then, impressing\nupon it the character of totality, breathing into it the breath of the\ncosmos. Thus understood, universality and artistic form are not two\nthings but one. (PPH 263).\n\n\nAnd:\n\nIn intuition, the single pulsates with the life of the whole, and the\nwhole is in the life of the single. Every genuine artistic\nrepresentation is itself and is the universe, the universe in\nthat individual form, and that individual form as\nthe universe. In every utterance, every fanciful [imaginative]\ncreation, of the poet, there lies the whole of human destiny, all\nhuman hope, illusions, griefs, joys, human grandeurs and miseries, the\nwhole drama of reality perpetually evolving and growing out of itself\nin suffering and joy. (PPH 262)\n\n\nCroce\u2014and undoubtedly the political situation in Italy in 1917\nplayed a role in this\u2014was anxious to assert the importance of\nart for humanity, and his assertion of it is full of feeling. And the\nclaim marks a decisive break from earlier doctrine: form is now linked\nwith universality rather that with particular feelings. But it is\ndifficult to see beyond such metaphors as \u2018impressing upon it\nthe character of totality\u2019 (not even with the help of\nCroce\u2019s Logic). One is reminded of the Kantian dictum\nthat in aesthetics we \u2018demand universality\u2019 in our\njudgements, but there are no explicit indications of such. There is\none piece of Crocean philosophy behind it: Since art takes place prior\nto the intellect, so the logical distinction between subject and\npredicate collapses; therefore perhaps at least one barrier is removed\nfrom speaking of the \u2018universality of art\u2019. But that does\nnot indicate what, positively, it means. It obvious that there is\nsomething right about speaking of the \u2018universal\ncharacter\u2019 of a Beethoven or a Michelangelo as opposed to the\npitiful, narrow little spectacle of this month\u2019s pop band, but\nCroce doesn\u2019t tell us what justifies or explains such talk\n(various others have reached a similar conclusion; see Orsini p. 214).\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean that he had no right to proclaim it,\nand perhaps not to count his readers as agreeing to it.\n10. Problems\n\nThere is a lot of Croce\u2019s aesthetics that we have not discussed,\nincluding his criticisms of the discipline of Rhetoric (Aes.\n67\u201373; PPH 233\u201335), his disparagement of\n\u2018genre criticism\u2019\u2014that is, his doctrine that there\nare ultimately no aesthetic differences amongst different kinds of art\n(Aes. 111\u201317, EA 53\u201360, PPH\n229\u201333)\u2014and his condemnation of psychological and other\nnaturalistic views of art (Aes.87\u201393; EA\n41\u20137). There is also his magnificent if contentious\npr\u00e9cis of the history of aesthetics (Aes.\n155\u2013474). But these are points of relative detail; the theory is\nwhole is sufficiently well before us now to conclude by mentioning\nsome general lines of criticism.\n10.1 Acting versus Contemplation\n\nThe equation of intuition with expression as at section 4.3 simply is\nnot, in end, plausible. C. J. Ducasse (1929) put his finger on it.\nWhen we look at a vase full of flowers, it simply does not matter how\nclosely or in what manner we attend to it; we do not create a\n\u2018work of art\u2019 unless we draw or paint it. Croce has lost\nsight of the ordinary sense of passively contemplating and\ndoing something; between reading and writing, looking and\ndrawing, listening and playing, dancing and watching. Of course all\nthe first members of these pairs involve a mental action of a\nkind, and there are important connections between the first members\nand the corresponding seconds\u2014perhaps in terms of what Berenson\ncalls ideated sensations\u2014but that is not to say that\nthere are not philosophically crucial distinctions between them.\n10.2 Privacy\n\nThe equation also defeats the purpose of art criticism or\ninterpretation, and indeed of the very notion of an aesthetic\ncommunity, of an audience. To say that the work of art is identical\nwith the intuition is to say that it is necessarily private. It is to\nsay, for example, that since one man\u2019s intuition of\nBotticelli\u2019s Venus is necessarily different from any\none else\u2019s, there is no such thing as Botticelli\u2019s\nVenus, understood not as a material painting but as a work of\nart; there is only Botticelli\u2019s-Venus-for-A,\nBotticelli\u2019s-Venus-for-B, and so on. But these\nintuitions cannot be compared, and there is no higher standard; thus\nthey cannot be said to agree or disagree, since any such comparison\nwould be logically impossible (see Tilghman 1971, Ch. 1, for further\ndiscussion; for at attempt at saving Croce, see Schusterman 1983). The\nposition is perhaps not contradictory, but it is exceedingly\nunattractive; it renders art a diversion away from reality, when as\nFreud emphasized\u2014to invoke a figure who is Croce\u2019s\nopposite in almost every respect\u2014the artist\u2019s struggle\nwith the medium is the attempt to conquer reality. Although Croce\ndisowned this consequence, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that on\nthis view art is a domain of fancy (in the bad sense), without any\ncheck upon vanity (see Aes. 122 for a point at which Croce\nalmost sees the point). If we bring back the material painted object\ninto the picture, of course, then there is no such difficulty: ones\n\u2018intuition\u2019 will be accurate, or one\u2019s\ninterpretation will be correct, just in case it corresponds to the\npicture (of course the notion of \u2018corresponds to the\npicture\u2019 is only a placeholder for a great deal to be supplied\nby theories of representation, perspective, expression and other parts\nof aesthetics; but the one thing that plausible theories will share is\na commitment to the object, the material painting).\n\nIt\u2019s worth emphasizing again that Croce\u2019s claim that\nintuition is expression, and consequently that works art are mental\nobjects, is not just an application of his general idealism. It is\nindependent of it. In the Encyclopaedia Britannica article,\nfor example, he allows himself to speak for convenience of the\n\u2018spiritual\u2019 and \u2018physical\u2019, in order to make\nthe point that the physical object is only of practical, and not of\naesthetic significance (PPH 227\u20138).\n10.3 The View of Language\n\nUndoubtedly Croce was influenced by his lifelong immersion in\nliterature in his proclamation that all language is poetry. And\nperhaps it is true that all language has some poetic qualities, and\nperhaps it is true that language \u2018in its actuality\u2019\nconsists of sentential utterances. But as Bosanquet pointed out in\n1919, this does not mean that language is only poetry, or\nthat the referential dimension of language does not exist. It must\nhave something that distinguishes a scientific treatise from a\ntune\u2014in fact it must be the same thing, which we are calling the\nreferential dimension, that serves to distinguish poetry from\na tune (it has to have sound and sense, as we say). So to say\nthat drawings and tunes are equally good examples of language seems,\nat best, strained. Perhaps Croce would have said that the referential\ndimension does not exist, or is a false abstraction; but his general\nphilosophical views may be forcing him down an unprepossessing path.\nMore promising would be a formalist endeavor to try to isolate the\npure sonic aspect of poetry\u2014comprising metre, alliteration and\nso on\u2014and then to search for instantiations or at least\nanalogies in the other arts.\n11. Conclusion\n\nSuppose Croce were to give up the idea that art is intuition,\nand agree that the work of art is identical with the material\nwork\u2014remember this would not prevent him being an idealist in\nhis general philosophy\u2014and suppose he allowed that he was wrong\nabout language. What would remain of his theory would arguably be its\nessence: that art is expression, and we engage with it via the\nintuitive capacity. It remains individual, and perhaps\npre-conceptual.\n\nIn closing, the reader may find it useful if we summarize the major\ndifferences\u2014narrowly on matters of aesthetics\u2014between\nCroce and Collingwood, who is often thought of as Croce\u2019s\nfollower. (Indeed the question of whether, how, and to what extent\nCroce \u2018influenced\u2019 Collingwood, not only in aesthetics but\nin wider matters of metaphysics and history, are vexed questions.\nAccording to a careful study Rik Peters, the influence was perhaps\npervasive insofar as Croce influenced the questions that\nCollingwood posed for himself, but Peters concludes that the answers\ngiven were of Collingwood\u2019s own making; see Peters 2011 for\nmore; for the matter specifically about art and aesthetics, see also\nHospers 1956, Donagan 1962, and Jones 1972.) First, Collingwood seems\nto agree with Croce that art, so to speak, is everywhere\u2014there\nno self-conscious perception that lacks expressive and aesthetic\nqualities\u2014whereas Croce\u2019s theory does not tend to regard\nthe expressive content of work of art as something \u2018in the\nartist\u2019, emphasizing instead its form and later its\n\u2018universality\u2019, Collingwood tries to explain expressive\ncontent in terms of a detailed theory of the emotions. Second,\nalthough Croce does devote some energy to discrediting the\n\u2018technical\u2019 theory of art, Collingwood offers a more\norganized and detailed analysis of why art is not \u2018craft\u2019,\nthough arguably the main points are Croce\u2019s. Finally,\nCollingwood devotes his final sections to a topic left unaddressed by\nCroce: the problem of whether or in what way the responses of the\naudience can constrain the object presented by the artist.\n",
