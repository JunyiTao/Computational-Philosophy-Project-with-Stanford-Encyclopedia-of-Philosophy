At its most basic level, the figure involves using a single word in two or more different senses. It is akin to \u201cpunning\u201d but without the connotation of triviality that often accompanies puns, hence the term \u201cbitextuality\u201d (Bronner 2010). In fact, according to Rudra\u1e6da, in his Ornaments of Poetry (K\u0101vy\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra, ca 855 CE), bitextuality is the perfect figure of speech (Gerow 1977). The phenomenon in Sanskrit was not limited to a word or two, here and there, but entire compositions were written which admit of two different meanings. One of the most prominent examples is of poems which, read one way tell the story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and read another way, narrate the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Examples are difficult to translate into English, since they rely on particularities of Sanskrit: word breaks which are frequently joined together, the ubiquity of compounds, and the fact of phonemic transformation at phonetic boundaries (sa\u1e43dhi) which can be reconstructed in multiple ways. For instance, d\u0101syas\u012btyuktv\u0101 can be disambiguated as d\u0101sy as\u012bty uktv\u0101 (saying, \u201cyou are my slave\u201d) or d\u0101syas\u012bty uktv\u0101 (saying [to myself] \u201cyou will give!\u201d) (Bronner 2010: xvii).\nThis particular linguistic device is not merely a figurative ornament, but is at the center of a major intellectual and literary movement. Poetic lexicons exist which contain stipulated meanings for syllables. These assist poets in creating bitextual compositions. Poetic commentaries tease out the multiplicities inherent in poems, whether or not they are intended by the author. Bronner (2010) identifies several ways in which the existence of bitextuality was a sticking point for theorists trying to give an account of word-meaning and the relationship between meaning and aesthetics. First, there is the difficulty of identifying a particular logical structure underpinning bitextuality. Second, there is the question of whether bitextuality\u2019s effects are due to word-meaning or to the sounds of words. Finally, there is the problem of the psychology of bitextuality.\nOne reason that bitextuality resists explanation is that the multiple \u201cregisters\u201d (ways of reading the text), such as the story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata mentioned above, are not merely two distinct sets of unrelated meanings. Rather, similes or metaphors frequently connect the readings. For instance, Dhana\u00f1jaya\u2019s \u201cPoem of Two Targets,\u201d through setting the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata \u201cside-by-side\u201d allows the reader to contrast the protagonists of the two epics (Bronner 2010: 110). Further, even where such relationships are not obvious, given the important principle that non-literal utterances must be supported by some warrant, whether conventional or due to speaker aims, most Sanskrit thinkers argued that no one would utter a sentence with two meanings that are unrelated. Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (11th century CE), in his Analysis of \u201cManifestation\u201d (Vyaktiviveka), argues that paranomasia, as a kind of meaning, must be coherent in the sense of having semantic fit, even if, as a kind of secondary meaning, there are cues which lead the reader to go beyond the strictly literal sense. However, unlike cases of metaphor, where there is an obstacle to semantic fit, as in \u201cDevadatta is a lion,\u201d bitextuality requires that there be (at least) two sets of coherent meanings which have semantic fit and also that there be a way to bring both meanings together. Further, since the trigger for bitextuality cannot be a failure of semantic fit, there must be some cue other than just the mere possibility of reading a sentence in two ways (McCrea 2008). \u0100nandavardhana, however, who comes two centuries before Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, argues that there may be bitextual poems in which two sets of meanings do not cause a further metaphor or simile (Bronner 2010: 204; McCrea 2008: 434).\n",
