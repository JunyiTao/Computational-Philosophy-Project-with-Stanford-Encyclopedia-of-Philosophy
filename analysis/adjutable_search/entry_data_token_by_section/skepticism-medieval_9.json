    "main_text": "Scholasticism and Skepticism || .4 Nicholas of Autrecourt and John Buridan\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nMedieval Skepticism was not a movement. Rather, it was a series of\n(sometimes isolated) worries and responses to such skeptical problems\nas those outlined above. While some impetus for later discussions was\ngained from classical skeptical sources, for the most part medieval\nskepticism took its own path. Among the distinctly medieval additions\nto the debate were an emphasis on the certainty of self-knowledge, and\nespecially on a widespread recognition across traditions that\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, and thus the possibility of Divine deceit on\nthese grounds, provides a special challenge to the epistemology of\nanyone who holds a theistic worldview.\n\nThe fate of skepticism in the Renaissance and Early Modern Periods has\nbeen discussed widely, but connections between these later versions\nand those of their medieval antecedents have been less thoroughly\nstudied. Heider (2016) explores skeptical themes in the \u201cSecond\nScholasticism\u201d of the 16th and 17th centuries. Thinkers such as\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez, John Poinsot, and Francisco de Oviedo\ncontinue to treat the Scotistic/Auriolian/Ockhamist issue of the\nintuitive cognition of non-existent objects. They do not consider\nglobal skepticism a live threat, as Descartes does, and their accounts\nare thus closer to those of 13th and 14th century philosophers.\n\nFor an overview of the later history of the skepticism, with a focus\non canonical Early Modern philosophers, see Popkin (2003).\n",
