    "main_text": "Language Ontology || Idiolects versus Social Languages\n1.1 Idiolects versus Social Languages\n\nKey to the distinction between an idiolect and a social language is\nthe fact that the same natural language, L, can be picked out\nin either of two ways: L as the language with specified\nlinguistic (semantic, syntactic, phonological, etc.)\nproperties, or L as the language possessed (spoken,\netc.) by a specific individual or population. French, for\nexample, is the language containing an adjective, rouge, that\nrefers to the color red and in its spoken form begins with a voiced\nuvular fricative, etc. But French is also the first language of most\nresidents of France, the lingua franca of C\u00f4te\nd\u2019Ivoire, the medium in which Simone de Beauvoir wrote, spoke,\nand thought, etc.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of languages we could conjure up in\nthe abstract using the first mode of individuation. But only a small\nnumber of these abstract objects will be realized in the\nsense of being describable in the second mode\u2014as possessed,\nknown, spoken, understood, or in some other respect used by some\nindividual or population. If we pick out a language as the language of\nsome individual, and believe we can specify its properties by\nreference to the intrinsic properties of that individual, then we are\npicking out an idiolect. If on the contrary we either specify it by\nreference to a community, or specify it by reference to an individual\nbut can only determine its properties by looking to their wider social\nenvironment (identifying salient linguistic authorities, for example),\nthen we are picking out a social language.\n\nLanguage theorists have varying conceptions of what it is for a\nlanguage to be realized. For David Lewis, a language in the abstract\n(which for him amounts to a pairing of sentences and meanings) is\nrealized in a population when it describes a convention governing\ntheir behaviour, in the specific sense summarized in\n Section 2.\n Lewis, then, takes a non-idiolectal perspective. For Noam Chomsky, in\ncontrast, a language is realized in an individual if it is\n\u201crepresented\u201d in that individual\u2019s \u201clanguage\nfaculty\u201d, a component of their brain. The goal of linguists\nworking in the Chomskian tradition is to make what is represented\nexplicit in the form of a theory, a grammar, for that individual.\nThis, then, is an idiolectal perspective. There is a twist, however.\nThe brain properties that most interest Chomsky are species-wide\nrather than unique to any individual, so the \u201cindividual\u201d\nis essentially the product of an idealization, useful for helping us\nto understand linguistic competence, a human biological trait. Still,\nwe can persist in calling this an idiolectal perspective in that it\neschews any essential role for languages of discrete linguistic\ncommunities.\n",
