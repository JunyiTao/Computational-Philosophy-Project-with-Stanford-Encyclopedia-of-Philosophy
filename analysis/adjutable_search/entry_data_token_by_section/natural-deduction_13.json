    "main_text": "Natural Deduction Systems for Modal and other Logics\n6. Natural Deduction Systems for Modal and other Logics\n\nNatural deduction systems were originally described, by Gentzen and\nJa\u015bkowski, for intuitionistic and classical First order logic:\nthe logical framework needed in formalizing intuitionistic and\nclassical mathematical theories. The techniques can be generalized,\nhowever, to a broad range of other logics. We will note briefly a few\nof these extensions.\n\nThe historically first seem to be systems of natural deduction for\nmodal logics. The logical behavior of necessity and\npossibility operators in familiar modal logics has deep analogies to\nthe logical behavior of universal and existential quantifiers. (This,\nof course, is what makes the \u201cpossible worlds\u201d semantics\nfor modality\u2014on which the necessity of a proposition is\nconstrued as its holding in every member of some range of\n\u201cworlds\u201d, and its possibility as its holding in at least\none\u2014so natural.) Introduction and elimination rules for the\nmodal operators, then, can be formulated in ways analogous to those\nfor the quantifiers. The elimination rule for necessity and the\nintroduction rule for possibility (at least for alethic modal\nlogics\u2026) are easy: what is necessary is true, and what is true\nis possible. For Necessity Introduction, we can have the rule that\n\\(\\square A\\) may be asserted after a subproof (of a special kind: in\nFitch\u2019s nomenclature, a strict subproof) in which \\(A\\) occurs:\nthere will be some restriction, differing in formulations for\ndifferent modal logics, on reiteration into these special subproofs.\n(Intuitively, in terms of the possible worlds semantic interpretation,\nthe idea is that something asserted before the beginning of the\nsubproof can be reiterated into it only if its truth does not depend\non any special feature of the actual world.) Possibility Elimination\nwill similarly ape the form of \\(\\exists\\)-Elim: for at least some\nrange of formulas \\(B\\), \\(B\\) may be inferred from \\(\\diamondsuit A\\)\nin the presence of a strict subproof having \\(A\\) as a hypothesis and\ncontaining \\(B\\), with the complication that \\(B\\) must satisfy a\ncondition analogous to the condition permitting formulas to be\nreiterated into strict subproofs. (For many modal logics, the easiest\nway of formulating the condition is to make \\(B\\) suitable, as it\nwere, after the fact: if \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\diamondsuit C\\), it\nmay be asserted after \\(\\diamondsuit A\\) and a strict subproof with\n\\(A\\) as hypothesis in which \\(C\\) occurs.) Fitch (1952) defines\nsystems like this for the modal logics S\\(_4\\) and T. (He\ndoesn\u2019t name T in the book, describing the system only as\n\u201cresembling S\\(_2\\)\u201d.) Curry (1950) and, in greater\ndetail, Curry (1963) gives similar rules for S\\(_4\\), formulated in a\nGentzen-style rather than Fitch-style presentation of Natural\nDeduction. Fitch (1966) gives formulations of a variety of alethic and\ndeontic propositional modal logics; Fitting (1983) is a comprehensive\nstudy of a variety of modal natural deduction systems and their\nmetatheoretic properties.\n\nThese modal systems are easy to use, and they have been included in\nsome logic textbooks for philosophy undergraduates. They are, however,\noften less elegant than natural deduction systems for first order\nlogic. The natural deduction rules for classical logic support the\ninterdefinability of the two quantifiers: \\(\\forall xA(x)\\) and\n\\(\\exists xA(x)\\) are provably equivalent to \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\nA(x)\\) and \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg A(x)\\) by use of the quantifier and\nnegation rules; and the rules for either quantifier are derivable,\nwhen it is defined in terms of the other, by use of the negation rules\nand the rules for the other quantifier. For most modal natural\ndeduction systems, the analogous results do not hold, and the\nequivalences have to be postulated specially. Again, \\(\\exists\nxA(x)\\lor\\exists xB(x)\\) is derivable from \\(\\exists x(A(x)\\lor\nB(x))\\) by use of the rules for the existential quantifier and\ndisjunction, but the restrictions on \\(\\diamondsuit\\)-E usually block\nthe analogous derivation in modal natural deduction. Normalization\ntheorems are known for some systems of modal natural deduction, but\noften they are not as strong as the analogous results for first order\nlogic: sometimes the subformula property of normal derivations\nrequires that the result of prefixing a limited number of modal\noperators to a formula count as one of its \u201chonorary\u201d\nsubformulas.\n\nGoing further afield, very pretty natural deduction systems can be\ngiven for at least fragments of systems of relevant logics. Early in\nthe literature on these logics the naturalness of these systems was\npresented as evidence for the naturalness of the logics (see Anderson\n1960; Anderson & Belnap 1962b; with some rearrangement, Anderson\n& Belnap 1962b, is reprinted in chapter 1 of Anderson & Belnap\n1975). The key connectives of relevant logics are implicational:\nentailment or relevant implication. The natural deduction rules for\nthese connectives are modifications of the standard rules for\nconditionals: the usual modus ponens for the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-E rule;\nand for the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I, a variant of the standard rule with a\nrestriction (formulated in Anderson & Belnap 1962b, with the aid\nof a simple and elegant bit of notation) ensuring that the hypothesis\nof the \\(\\rightarrow\\)-I subproof is actually used in deriving the\nconsequent. The pure implicational systems defined in Anderson and\nBelnap (1962b) are very elegant, and the conceptual arguments based on\nthem impressive! Another fragment of the standard relevant logics,\nhaving quantifiers and the \u201cBoolean\u201d operators \\(\\neg,\\\n\\land\\) and \\(\\lor\\), but lacking the characteristic \\(\\rightarrow\\)\noperator, also has a nice natural deduction formulation: the positive\nand negative rules for the quantifiers and Booleans mentioned above in\n \u00a75.3,\n but omitting the ex falso quodlibet version of its \\(\\neg\\)-E rule.\n(The propositional part of this fragment of relevant logic is\ndiscussed in Anderson & Belnap 1962a, which is reproduced in\nchapter 3 of Anderson & Belnap 1975.) Unfortunately natural\ndeduction systems for full relevant logics, incorporating all the\nconnectives, require rules and restrictions that may strike many as ad\nhoc.\n\nSimilar techniques can be adapted for formulations of other\nsubstructural logics in the sense of Restall (2000). Relevant logics\nare examples of logics lacking the property of Thinning: that is,\nlacking the principle that if \\(\\Gamma\\vdash B\\) then \\(\\Gamma,A\\vdash\nB\\). Non-contractive logics\u2014logics in which the inference from\n\\((A\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B))\\) to \\((A\\rightarrow B)\\) is\nrejected\u2014can be captured by restrictions on the number of times\na hypothesis can be used. (Formulations of Contraction-free and\nThinning-free logics as sequent calculii analogous to Gentzen\u2019s\n\\(\\mathcal{LJ}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{LK}\\) omit or restrict the\n\u201cstructural\u201d rules of Contraction and Thinning: hence the\nname \u2018substructural logics\u2019. For background in\nsubstructural logic, see Restall 2018.)\n\nThen there are non-distributive logics, in which the inference from\n\\((A\\land(B\\lor C))\\) to \\(((A\\land B)\\lor(A\\land C))\\) is rejected:\nsuch logics have been proposed as quantum logics. A natural deduction\nsystem for such a logic (based on the form of sequent natural\ndeduction used in Lemmon (1965), though Fitch-style versions are also\npossible) is given in the textbook, Gibbins 1987.\n",
