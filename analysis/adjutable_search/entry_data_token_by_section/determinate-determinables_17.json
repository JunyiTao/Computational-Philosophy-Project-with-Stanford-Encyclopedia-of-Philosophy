This criterion again seems to\nsupport taking determinates to be prior to determinables, for once the\nspecific, or determinate, facts are fixed, then, it seems, more\ngeneral/determinable facts are thereby fixed, with the latter being at\nbest ontologically real abstractions from the former. By way of\ncontrast, fixing the determinable facts does not fix the determinate\nfacts (as is reflected in Asymmetric modal dependence).\n\nThat determinable facts are fixed by determinate facts can be\nchallenged, however, by attention to the constitutive modal fact about\nany given determinable instance\u2014say, a given instance of\nred\u2014that it is of a type that might have been\ndifferently determined\u2014say, by scarlet rather than\nmaroon (see Wilson 2012). Here the suggestion is that no\ndeterminate fact or complex combination of such facts can provide a\nnon-gerrymandered basis for such a constitutive modal\n fact.[41]\n\nOne response is to maintain that a fundamental base need only ground\nthe contingent non-modal facts at a world, as Schaffer (2004: 90)\nsuggests; if so, then the failure of determinate instances to ground\ncertain modal facts about determinable instances won\u2019t impugn\nthe priority of determinates. One might maintain, however, that a\nsupposed \u201cground\u201d for some entity which failed to provide\na metaphysical basis for modal facts constitutive of the entity would\nbe incomplete, at best. As French puts it,\n\n\nfixing the non-modal facts and leaving modal flexibility out of the\npicture would yield an incomplete inventory. And the most obvious way\nof fixing the modal facts would be to include the determinables\nthemselves in the fundamental base. (2014: 284)\n\n\nThere is a worry that this line of thought will overgenerate, in that\nmany higher-level features and objects (e.g., tables) are to some\nextent constitutively modally flexible. A possible response is that\nwhether the line of thought applies to a given case will depend on\nwhether the basis for the modal flexibility is itself derivable from\nor otherwise clearly generated by lower-level goings-on. For example,\nmultiply realizable higher-level features (say, temperature in\nthermodynamic systems) whose modal flexibility results from the\nimposition of lower-level physical constraints would not be\nappropriately deemed fundamental (or as fundamental as their physical\nrealizers).\n",
