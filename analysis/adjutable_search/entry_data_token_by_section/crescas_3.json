    "main_text": "His works || Refutation of Christian Principles\n2.3 Refutation of Christian Principles\nThe book known by the name \u201cRefutation of Christian\nPrinciples\u201d (we don\u2019t know the original name of this work). This\nbook was originally written in Catalan around 1397\u20131398, and is\navailable only in the medieval Hebrew translation of Rabbi Josef Ibn\nShem\n Tov[8]\nand in modern English\nand Spanish translations of the Hebrew. The target audience of\nthe Catalan work is probably the Jews of Aragon who didn\u2019t read\nHebrew, and the Jewish descendants of the conversos of 1391. In\nhis book, Crescas critiques ten principles of the Christian faith: 1.\nOriginal sin. 2. The liberation from this sin. 3. The Trinity. 4.\nIncarnation. 5. The virginity of Maria. 6. Transubstantiation. 7.\nBaptism. 8. The coming of the Messiah. 9. The new laws. 10. Demons.\n\n\nIn these topics Crescas demonstrates a good understanding of the\nChristian theology of his time. In the majority of these subjects he\nuses philosophical and logical arguments against Christian dogma and\nnot quotations from the Bible. This book was probably one of the more\nphilosophical works of the Jewish critics of\n Christianity.[9]\nInterestingly, Crescas utilizes\nin his polemical book some of the very Aristotelian opinions that he\nhimself critiques in his philosophical oeuvre Or Hashem. The\nreason for this contradiction is probably that the aim of Crescas in\nhis polemic works is to convince Jews not to convert to Christianity,\nand Jewish apostates to return to Judaism. The most effective method of\nattaining this goal was to utilize the most popular science in his\ntime, and not necessarily what he considered to be closest to the\ntruth. We can summarize that in his polemic works Crescas has a\npolemical goal, and in his philosophical works he has a\nphilosophical\n goal.[10]\nThe Hebrew translator\nexplains that the reason for this divergence was that the philosophical\nworks were written before the polemical ones, but after writing Or\nHashem, Crescas returned to Aristotelian science. But this\nexplanation doesn\u2019t accord with the chronological order of the writing,\nand we don\u2019t have any reason to suppose that Crescas retreated from his\nanti-Aristotelian critiques.\n",
