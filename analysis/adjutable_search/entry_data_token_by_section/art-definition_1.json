    "main_text": "Definitions from the History of Philosophy || Some examples\n2.1 Some examples\n\n\nPlato holds in the Republic and elsewhere that the arts are\nrepresentational, or mimetic (sometimes translated\n\u201cimitative\u201d).  Artworks are ontologically dependent on,\nimitations of, and therefore inferior to, ordinary physical\nobjects. Physical objects in turn are ontologically dependent on, and\nimitations of, and hence inferior to, what is most real, the\nnon-physical unchanging Forms. Grasped perceptually, artworks present\nonly an appearance of an appearance of the Forms, which are grasped by\nreason alone. Consequently, artistic experience cannot yield\nknowledge. Nor do the makers of artworks work from knowledge. Because\nartworks engage an unstable, lower part of the soul, art should be\nsubservient to moral realities, which, along with truth, are more\nmetaphysically fundamental and, properly understood, more humanly\nimportant than, beauty. The arts are not, for Plato, the primary\nsphere in which beauty operates. The Platonic conception of beauty is\nextremely wide and metaphysical: there is a Form of Beauty, which can\nonly be known non-perceptually, but it is more closely related to the\nerotic than to the arts. (See Janaway 1998, the entry on\n Plato\u2019s aesthetics, and the entry on\n Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry.)\n Kant has a definition of art, and of fine art; the latter, which\nKant calls the art of genius, is \u201ca kind of representation that\nis purposive in itself and, though without an end, nevertheless\npromotes the cultivation of the mental powers for sociable\ncommunication\u201d (Kant, Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Guyer translation, section 44, 46).) When fully\nunpacked, the definition has representational, formalist and\nexpressivist elements, and focuses as much on the creative activity of\nthe artistic genius (who, according to Kant, possesses an \u201cinnate\nmental aptitude through which nature gives the rule to art\u201d) as on the\nartworks produced by that activity. Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory is, for\narchitectonic reasons, not focused on art. Art for Kant falls under\nthe broader topic of aesthetic judgment, which covers judgments of the\nbeautiful, judgments of the sublime, and teleological judgments of\nnatural organisms and of nature itself. So Kant\u2019s definition of art is\na relatively small part of his theory of aesthetic judgment. And\nKant\u2019s theory of aesthetic judgment is itself situated in a hugely\nambitious theoretical structure that, famously, aims, to account for,\nand work out the interconnections between, scientific knowledge,\nmorality, and religious faith. (See the entry on\n Kant\u2019s Aesthetics and Teleology \nand the general entry on \n  Immanuel Kant.)\n\n\nHegel\u2019s account of art incorporates his view of beauty; he\ndefines beauty as the sensuous/perceptual appearance or expression of\nabsolute truth. The best artworks convey, by sensory/perceptual means,\nthe deepest metaphysical truth.  The deepest metaphysical truth,\naccording to Hegel, is that the universe is the concrete realization\nof what is conceptual or rational. That is, what is conceptual or\nrational is real, and is the imminent force that animates and propels\nthe self-consciously developing universe. The universe is the concrete\nrealization of what is conceptual or rational, and the rational or\nconceptual is superior to the sensory. So, as the mind and its\nproducts alone are capable of truth, artistic beauty is metaphysically\nsuperior to natural beauty (Hegel, Lectures, [1886, 4]). A\ncentral and defining feature of beautiful works of art is that,\nthrough the medium of sensation, each one presents the most\nfundamental values of its\ncivilization.[1]\nArt, therefore, as a cultural expression, operates in the same sphere\nas religion and philosophy, and expresses the same content as\nthey. But art \u201creveals to consciousness the deepest interests of\nhumanity\u201d in a different manner than do religion and philosophy,\nbecause art alone, of the three, works by sensuous means.  So, given\nthe superiority of the conceptual to the non-conceptual, and the fact\nthat art\u2019s medium for expressing/presenting culture\u2019s\ndeepest values is the sensual or perceptual, art\u2019s medium is\nlimited and inferior in comparison with the medium that religion uses\nto express the same content, viz., mental imagery. Art and religion in\nturn are, in this respect, inferior to philosophy, which employs a\nconceptual medium to present its content. Art initially predominates,\nin each civilization, as the supreme mode of cultural expression,\nfollowed, successively, by religion and philosophy. Similarly, because\nthe broadly \u201clogical\u201d relations between art, religion and\nphilosophy determine the actual structure of art, religion, and\nphilosophy, and because cultural ideas about what is intrinsically\nvaluable develop from sensuous to non-sensuous conceptions, history is\ndivided into periods that reflect the teleological development from\nthe sensuous to the conceptual. Art in general, too, develops in\naccord with the historical growth of non-sensuous or conceptual\nconceptions from sensuous conceptions, and each individual art-form\ndevelops historically in the same way (Hegel, Lectures; Wicks\n1993, see also the entries on\n  Hegel and on \n  Hegel\u2019s Aesthetics). \n\nFor treatments of other influential definitions\nof art, inseparable from the complex philosophical systems or corpuses in which\nthey occur, see, for example, the entries on\n 18th Century German Aesthetics,\n Arthur Schopenhauer,\n Friedrich Nietzsche,\n and Dewey\u2019s Aesthetics.\n",
