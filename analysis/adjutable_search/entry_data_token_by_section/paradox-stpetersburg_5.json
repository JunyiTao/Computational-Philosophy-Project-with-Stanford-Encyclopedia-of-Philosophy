    "main_text": "Relative Expected Utility Theory\n6. Relative Expected Utility Theory\n\nIn the Petrograd game introduced by Colyvan (2008) the player wins $1\nmore than in the St. Petersburg game regardless of how many times the\ncoin is flipped. So instead of winning 2 utility units if the coin\nlands heads on the first toss, the player wins 3; and so on. See\n Table 1.\n\nTable 1\n\nProbability\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\u2026 \n\nSt. Petersburg\n2\n4\n8\n\u2026 \n\nPetrograd\n\\(2+1\\)\n\\(4+1\\)\n\\(8+1\\)\n\u2026 \n\n\nIt seems obvious that the Petrograd game is worth more than the St.\nPetersburg game. However, it is not easy to explain why. Both games\nhave infinite expected utility, so the expected utility principle\ngives the wrong answer. It is not true that the Petrograd game is\nworth more than the St. Petersburg game because its expected utility\nis higher; the two games have exactly the same expected utility. This\nshows that the expected utility principle is not universally\napplicable to all risky choices, which is an interesting observation\nin its own right.\n\nIs the Petrograd game worth more than the St. Petersburg game because\nthe outcomes of the Petrograd game dominate those of the St.\nPetersburg game? In this context, dominance means that the player will\nalways win $1 more regardless of which state of the world turns out to\nbe the true state, that is, regardless of how many times the coin is\nflipped. The problem is that it is easy to imagine versions of the\nPetrograd game to which the dominance principle would not be\napplicable. Imagine, for instance, a version of the Petrograd game\nthat is exactly like the one in\n Table 1\n except that for some very improbable outcome (say, if the coin lands\nheads for the first time on the 100th flip) the player wins\n1 unit less than in the St. Petersburg game. This game, the\nPetrogradskij game, does not dominate the St. Petersburg game.\nHowever, since it is almost certain that the player will be better off\nby playing the Petrogradskij game a plausible decision theory should\nbe able to explain why the Petrogradskij game is worth more than the\nSt. Petersburg game.\n\nColyvan claims that we can solve this puzzle by introducing a new\nversion of expected utility theory called Relative Expected Utility\nTheory (REUT). According to REUT we should calculate the difference in\nexpected utility between the two options for each possible outcome.\nFormally, the relative expected utility (\\(\\reu\\)) of act \\(A_k\\) over\n\\(A_l\\) is \n\\[\n\\reu(A_k,A_l) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i(u_{ki} - u_{li}).\n\\]\n\n\nAccording to Colyvan, it is rational to choose \\(A_k\\) over \\(A_l\\) if\nand only if \\(\\reu(A_k,A_l) \\gt 0\\).\n\nColyvan\u2019s REUT neatly explains why the Petrograd game is worth\nmore than the St. Petersburg game because the relative expected\nutility is 1. REUT also explains why the Petrogradskij game is worth\nmore than the St. Petersburg game: the difference in expected utility\nis \\(1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^{100}\\) which is > 0.\n\nHowever, Peterson (2013) notes that REUT cannot explain why the\nLeningradskij game is worth more than the Leningrad\ngame (see\n Table 2).\n The Leningradskij game is the version of the Petrograd game in which\nthe player in addition to receiving a finite number of units of\nutility also gets to play the St. Petersburg game (SP) if the coin\nlands heads up in the second round. In the Leningrad game the player\ngets to play the St. Petersburg game (SP) if the coin lands heads up\nin the third round.\n\nTable 2\n\nProbability\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\u2026 \n\nLeningrad\n2\n4\n\\(8+\\textrm{SP}\\)\n16\n\u2026 \n\nLeningradskij\n2\n\\(4+\\textrm{SP}\\)\n8\n16\n\u2026\n\n\nIt is obvious that the Leningradskij game is worth more than the\nLeningrad game because the probability that the player gets to play SP\nas a bonus (which has infinite expected utility) is higher. However,\nREUT cannot explain why. The difference in expected utility for the\nstate that occurs with probability \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) in\n Table 2\n is \\(-\\infty\\) and it is \\(+\\infty\\) for the state that occurs with\nprobability \\(\\frac{1}{8}.\\) Therefore, because \\(p \\cdot \\infty =\n\\infty\\) for all positive probabilities \\(p\\), and \u201c\\(\\infty -\n\\infty\\)\u201d is undefined in standard analysis, REUT cannot be\napplied to these games.\n\nBartha (2007) and (2016) proposes a more complex version of relative\nexpected utility theory. In Bartha\u2019s theory, the utility of an\noutcome x is compared to the utility of some alternative\noutcome y and a basepoint z, which can be chosen\narbitrarily as long as x and y are at least as preferred\nas z. The relative utility of x vis-\u00e0-vis\ny and the base-point z is then defined as the ratio\nbetween u(x) \u2013 u(z) and the\ndenominator u(y) \u2013 u(z); the\nlatter is a \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d to which\nu(x) \u2013 u(z) is compared. So\nif u(x) = 10, u(y) = 20 and\nu(z)= 0, then the relative utility of x\nvis-\u00e0-vis y and the base-point z is\nU(x, y; z) = 0.5.\n\nBartha\u2019s suggestion is to ask the agent to compare the St.\nPetersburg game to a lottery between two other games. If, for\ninstance, Petrograd+ is the game in which the player always\nwins 2 units more than in the St. Petersburg game regardless of how\nmany times the coin is tossed, then the player could compare the\nPetrograd game to a lottery between Petrograd+ and the St.\nPetersburg game. By determining for what probabilities p a\nlottery in which one plays Petrograd+ with probability\np and the St. Petersburg game with probability \\(1-p\\) is\nbetter than playing the Petrograd game for sure one can establish a\nmeasure of the relative value of Petrograd as compared to\nPetrograd+ or St. Petersburg. (For details, see Sect. 5 in\nBartha 2016. See also Colyvan and H\u00e1jek\u2019s 2016 discussion\nof Bartha\u2019s theory.) \n\nAn odd feature of Bartha\u2019s theory is that two lotteries can have\nthe same relative utility even if one is strictly\npreferred to the other; see Bartha (2011: 34\u201335). This indicates\nthat the relative utilities assigned to lotteries in Bartha\u2019s\ntheory are not always choice-guiding. \n\nLet us also mention another, quite simple variation of the original\nSt. Petersburg game, which is played as follows (see Peterson 2015:\n87): A manipulated coin lands heads up with probability 0.4 and the\nplayer wins a prize worth \\(2^n\\) units of utility, where n is\nthe number of times the coin was tossed. This game, the Moscow game,\nis more likely to yield a long sequence of flips and is therefore\nworth more than the St. Petersburg game, but the expected utility of\nboth games is the same, because both games have infinite expected\nutility. It might be tempting to say that the Moscow game is more\nattractive because the Moscow game stochastically dominates\nthe St. Petersburg game. (That one game stochastically dominates\nanother game means that for every possible outcome, the first game has\nat least as high a probability of yielding a prize worth at least\nu units of utility as the second game; and for some u,\nthe first game yields u with a higher probability than the\nsecond.) However, the stochastic dominance principle is inapplicable\nto games in which there is a small risk that the player wins a prize\nworth slightly less than in the other game. We can, for instance,\nimagine that if the coin lands heads on the 100th flip the\nMoscow game pays one unit less than the St. Petersburg game; in this\nscenario neither game stochastically dominates the other. Despite\nthis, it still seems reasonable to insist that the game that is almost\ncertain to yield a better outcome (in the sense explained above) is\nworth more. The challenge is to explain why in a robust and\nnon-arbitrary way.\n",
