    "main_text": "\n\nFrederick Douglass (c. 1817\u20131895) is a central figure in U.S.\nand African American\n history.[1]\n He was born into slavery circa 1817; his mother was an enslaved black\nwoman, while his father was reputed to be his white master. Douglass\nescaped from slavery in 1838 and rose to become a principal leader and\nspokesperson for the U.S. Abolition\n movement.[2]\n He would eventually develop into a towering figure for the U.S. Civil\nRights Movement and American politics, and his legacy would be claimed\nby a diverse span of groups, from liberals and integrationists to\nconservatives to nationalists, within and without black America.\n\nHe wrote three autobiographies, each one expanding on the details of\nhis life. The first was Narrative of the Life of Frederick\nDouglass, an American Slave, Written By Himself (1845); the\nsecond was My Bondage and My Freedom (1855); and the third\nwas Life and Times of Frederick Douglass\n (1881/1893).[3]\n They are now foremost examples of the American slave narrative. In\naddition to being autobiographical, they are also, as is standard,\nexplicitly works of political and social criticism and moral suasion;\nthey aim at the hearts and minds of the readers. Their greater purpose\nwas to attack slavery, contribute to its abolition in the United\nStates, and argue for black Americans\u2019 full inclusion into the\nnation.\n\nShortly after escaping from slavery, Douglass began operating as a\nspokesperson, giving numerous speeches about his life and experiences\nfor William Lloyd Garrison\u2019s American Anti-Slavery Society. To\nspread his story and assist the abolitionist cause and counter early\ncharges that someone so eloquent as he could not have been a slave,\nDouglass wrote and published his first autobiography, The\nNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave,\nWritten By Himself. It brought Douglass fame throughout the\nUnited States and the United Kingdom, and it provided the funds to\npurchase his freedom. Douglass eventually broke with Garrison and\nfounded his first paper, the North Star. He served as its\nchief editor and authored a considerable body of letters, editorials,\nand speeches from then on. These writings are collected in Philip\nFoner\u2019s multi-volume, The Life and Writings of Frederick\nDouglass (1950\u20131975), and John W. Blassingame and John R.\nMcKivigan\u2019s multi-volume, The Frederick Douglass Papers\n (1979\u20131992).[4]\n\nDouglass\u2019s advocacy in the abolition movement and his continued\nwork after the U.S. Civil War, and his writings and participation in\nnational discussions about the nature and future of the American\nRepublic, made him a significant figure in American history and the\nhistory of American political ideas. His writings, speeches, and his\nnational and international work have inspired many lines of discussion\nin debate within the fields of American and African American history\nand political science. Moreover, political thinkers representing\ndifferent ideological positions, including liberals, libertarians, and\neconomic and social conservatives, claim his legacy.\n\nBut what does anything about this have to do with philosophy? The\nconnections between Douglass\u2019s legacy and social and political\nphilosophy are numerous and ongoing. His ideas about humanity,\nliberty, equality, property, democracy, and individual and social\ndevelopment addressed immediately pressing concerns, but they were\nalso theoretical\u2014he self-consciously addressed their moral and\ntheological foundations. Furthermore, his work is connected to\nacademic philosophy through the uptake of his political and social\nlegacy and writings by later African American philosophers such as\nW.E.B. Du Bois (1868\u20131963) and Alain Locke\n (1884\u20131954).[5]\n In contemporary philosophy, Douglass\u2019s work is usually taken up\nwithin American philosophy, Africana philosophy, black political\nphilosophy, and moral, social, and political philosophy more broadly.\nIn particular, the discussions that involve Douglass focus on his\nviews concerning some of the topics reviewed in this entry: slavery\nand racial segregation; natural law and the U.S. constitution;\nliberalism and republicanism; violence, self-respect, and dignity;\nracial integration versus emigration or separation; cultural\nassimilation and racial amalgamation; democratic action; and\nwomen\u2019s suffrage. Additionally, just as there is a rich\ndiscussion about Douglass in philosophy and political theory, there is\na related discussion about Douglass\u2019s rhetoric, particularly the\nstructure and meaning of his political rhetoric as displayed in his\nspeeches, autobiographies, and other\n writings.[6]\n\nFor students and teachers first learning about Douglass, there is no\nbetter place to start than his first autobiography, The Narrative\nof the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845). Next, read some of his\nspeeches and writings referenced in this entry, especially \u201cWhat\nTo the Slave Is The Fourth of July?\u201d (1852 [SFD: 55\u201392]).\nThen dive into the historical, political, literary, and philosophical\nliterature about Douglass.\n",
