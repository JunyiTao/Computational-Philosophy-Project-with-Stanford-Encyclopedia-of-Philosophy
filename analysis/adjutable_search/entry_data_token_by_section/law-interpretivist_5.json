    "main_text": "Disagreement\n6. Disagreement\n The fundamental assumption that ties enforcing rights and\nobligations to institutional practice serves to fix the subject matter\nof inquiry by setting the interpretive problem. Notice however that\nit does not rise to a conceptual constraint as these are normally\nunderstood. For the theory treats it as a commonly held moral\nhypothesis about the normative relevance of institutional practice. As\na substantive hypothesis it is not immune to doubt but is subject to\ncritical scrutiny. It would remain possible coherently to reject the\nassumption as mistaken, as long as an alternative hypothesis could\nmake intelligible other common pre-theoretical commitments. The\ndoctrine that Dworkin (1986) calls \u201cpragmatism\u201d\nillustrates this possibility, since it rejects the dependence of\npermissible enforcement on legality as defined above, and recommends\ninstead that claims of obligation be enforced when doing so is\njustified by forward looking considerations. For the pragmatist, the\nclaims\u2019 relation to institutional practice is to be invoked merely for\nstrategic purposes. We might say that the assumption that connects\nenforcement to institutional practice fixes but does not determine the\nsubject matter of legal theory.  Moreover, the basic assumption does\nnot by itself entail an answer to the interpretive problem that it\nsets. That is the problem of constitutive explanation with which we\nbegan: how institutional practice figures in the constitutive\ndetermination of legal rights and obligations.\n\n\nThis picture requires that it be possible to share a subject matter\nwithout sharing truths that define it. Interpretivism about law\nimplies the possibility of disagreement about the grounds of law,\nbecause it makes law\u2019s constitutive explanation a matter of\nsubstance\u2014specifically, a matter of the moral justification of\nthe role of institutional history in the determination of rights and\nobligations. Notice that the possibility of disagreement about grounds\nis implied not only by the controversial nature of morality, but\nalready by the substantive (therefore potentially controversial)\ncharacter of the grounds. If the question of grounds is substantive,\nwe can disagree about what they are without changing the\nsubject. Unsurprisingly, this is the issue with which Dworkin\nbegins Law\u2019s Empire (1986). \n\n\nOne way to make out the possibility of disagreement about grounds that\ninterpretivism implies is to show that disagreement of that character\nobtains. Dworkin said that disagreement about the grounds of law is\npervasive. Many of his critics objected that the kinds of disagreement\nthat Dworkin seemed to have in mind can be explained in a way other\nthan as disagreements about grounds: for example, disagreements about\nthe social facts that constitute legal norms, or about how to apply\nthe norms, or about how to decide cases where the norms run out\n(therefore how to extend the law), against a background of agreement\non the grounds of law (Leiter 2003; Shapiro 2007, though not a\ndefender of interpretivism, finds such responses unsatisfactory).\n\n\nAnother strategy is to show the possibility of such disagreement\ndirectly, by offering arguments against the view that it must be\nimpossible.\n\n\nThe first strategy is unlikely to be productive. (Notice that some\ntheorists nonetheless think the strategy important to the defense of\ninterpretivism; see Smith 2010.) The interpretivist might begin by\nconsidering judgments about the existence of some legal\nobligation. His critics will say that disagreement in such judgments\nconceals agreement on grounds. The interpretivist will say that\nagreement in such judgments conceals disagreement on grounds. Absent\nsome demonstration that actual agreements and disagreements are of one\nor the other kind, it will be hard to resolve the issue. It is\npossible instead to construct an inference to the best explanation of\nthe phenomena, and the interpretivist may press that line. However, as I\nwill suggest, the success of his thesis does not depend on the\noutcome.\n\n\nThe second strategy addresses what really matters for\ninterpretivism. It may be that all lawyers agree on some question about the grounds of\nlaw. That would be consistent with it being a matter of substance what\nthe grounds are: perhaps lawyers just happen to concur in their\njudgments. What the interpretivist needs to show is that to challenge\nthe consensus would not be to change the subject. He needs to show\nthat disagreement about grounds is on the cards.\n\n\nTo defend the claim that disagreement about grounds is indeed\npossible, one would have to resist the assumption that, as a general\nmatter, we can only share a subject matter by sharing truths that\ndefine it. Indeed Dworkin, anticipating that his examples of disagreement\nthat appears to be about grounds would be reinterpreted by his critics\nas disagreement about social facts or about how to change the law,\ninvited his critics not to rule out the possibility that disagreement\nmight be more fundamental. He said that to think that disagreement\nabout grounds is never possible, for the reason that to share a\nsubject matter we must share criteria that define it, is a\nphilosophical prejudice: he called the prejudice \u201cthe semantic\nsting\u201d (see Dworkin 1986).\n\n\nIt is now a familiar claim in general philosophy that, in the case of\ncertain objects and phenomena, an account of their nature is not built\ninto the understanding that is\nsufficient for competent use of the words that refer to them (or into the understanding\nof the relevant concepts that is sufficient for competent thinking). Such understanding, captured in criteria of\napplication and truths shared among competent users, does not provide\nsufficient metaphysical guidance. In many cases, such understanding\nincludes an open-ended clause that allows for the existence of a\ncertain kind of explanation of the nature of the objects, or, at\nleast, that understanding does not rule out some such explanation, yet\ncertainly falls short of picking out any particular explanation from\namong the eligible ones. In such cases, substantive investigation is\nindispensable to a complete explanation of the nature of the relevant\nobject, and often must come first, before we realize that it is indeed\ngermane to the nature of the object (Kripke 1980; Burge 1986; Rey\n1998; Williamson 2007; Stavropoulos 1996, 2012). \n\n\nNow if it is granted that, at least in some cases, the explanation of the nature of some\nobjects may turn on matters of substance, the interpretivist may\ndefend the view that judgments about the grounds of law are open to\nchallenge. For he can simply construct such a challenge explicitly as\none that disputes that the considerations that are generally regarded\nto be the grounds of law are indeed such grounds (cf. Burge\u2019s strategy\nin Burge 1986).\n\n\nIt is easy for the interpretivist to pursue that strategy. He can show\nthat there exist different eligible and mutually inconsistent\ncandidates for legal relevance. Do achievement intentions of\nlegislatures (intentions to change the law in a certain way) play any\nrole in the explanation of the impact of a statute? If so, do they\nplay a constitutive or merely an evidentiary role? Do expectations\nthat some arrangement introduced by statute will persist ever play\nsome role in the explanation of the statute\u2019s impact? If so, do such\nexpectations, even if formed in the face of explicit notice to the\ncontrary, prevent later legislation from radically changing the\noriginal arrangement (cf. National Federation of Independent\nBusiness v. Sebelius 567 US 519 (2012) (11-393), opinion of the\ncourt), or is their legal relevance extinguished by the explicit\nnotice (cf. National Federation of Independent Business\nv. Sebelius, Ginsburg, dissenting)?  As we already saw in section\n4, institutional practice includes countless examples of such\ninconsistent eligible candidates, each eminently defensible as legally\nrelevant. But suppose that almost all lawyers agree on the relevance\nof one of a pair of inconsistent candidates. The fact that they do is\nyet another aspect of the practice, which is not privileged. For the\ninterpretivist, substantive\u2014moral\u2014considerations serve the\npurpose of determining the relevance of any factor. On the basis of\nsuch considerations, he can argue that the unpopular candidate is in\nfact relevant so the lawyers\u2019 consensus is mistaken.\n\n\nThis view traces the intelligibility of fundamental challenges about\nthe grounds of law to unusual moral views about the legal relevance of\nsome factor. If this is correct, we should expect that such challenges\nmay occur with some regularity, and that arguments once widely\nconsidered not colorable may come to be taken seriously and finally to\nbecome dominant. The quick transition, from nonstarter to endorsement\nby the US Supreme Court, of the view that the Constitution limits\nlegislative authority to regulate private civilian uses of firearms\n(District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 US 570 (2008) (07\u2013290)),\nor of the view that the regulatory powers of the federal government do\nnot extend to mandating the purchase of health insurance (National\nFederation of Independent Business v.  Sebelius, cited above),\nare recent illustrations.\n7. Related theories\n\nInterpretivism offers a moral explanation of how institutional practice shapes legal rights and obligations. It is possible to offer an alternative explanation that is moral in character, without embracing certain other claims characteristic of interpretivism. Focusing on the mechanism through which institutions can change people\u2019s normative situation, Greenberg (2014) and Hershovitz (2015) claim that legal rights and obligations are a subset of the moral rights and obligations that obtain in virtue of the actions of legal institutions. Greenberg claims that the subset is composed of those moral rights and obligations that obtain in the \u2018legally proper way\u2019. Which way is legally proper is to be understood in light of a normative constraint constitutive of law: that law is supposed to improve the moral situation. When legal institutions improve the moral situation, e.g. by taking action that secures coordination, the resulting moral obligations are legal obligations. But when the actions of legal institutions give rise to obligations to resist or undo or otherwise mitigate what the institutions did (an obligation to repeal legislation, shelter the persecuted, and so on), the resulting obligations do not trace to the action of institutions in the proper way (Greenberg 2014, Schaus 2015). By contrast, Hershovitz argues that we should not be overly concerned with the boundaries of the legal. As we saw, the question about the boundaries is a matter of the first importance for theories on which legal rights and obligations are created through some special nonmnoral mechanism but need not be consequential for theories that appeal to no such mechanism (see  section 5). Developing a point from Dworkin, Hershovitz argues that the idea that there is an existing body of law, which comprises all and only those rights and obligations in force in a given system, plays no role in legal practice (Hershovitz 2015, crediting Dworkin 1978). He argues that the better view is that the practice of legal institutions has a variety of normative consequences, moral and prudential. We might use \u2018legal\u2019 as a label for some of those, depending on our purposes: for example, to mark the source of an obligation or the institution that gets to enforce the obligation (Hershovitz 2015).\n\nIt is common ground between these views and interpretivism that, like other contingencies, the practice of legal institutions may change rights and obligations because and to the extent that it is morally relevant. This implies that the rights and obligations so produced are ordinary, genuine moral rights and obligations. Moreover, it implies that legal institutions can exploit the fact that their action is generally morally relevant in order reliably and systematically to change what we owe to each other. While the views in discussion focus on these implications, interpretivism concentrates on the problem of identifying the content and operation of the principles that in fact make legal practice morally relevant and govern its effects on rights and obligations.",
