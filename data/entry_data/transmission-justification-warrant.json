    "preamble": "\n\nTed is on his way to the Philosophy Department, early in the freezing\nmorning. Although he doesn\u2019t know how cold it is, Ted\nconjectures that the temperature must be below 0\u00b0C. Out of\ncuriosity, he checks the weather app of his smartphone. To his\nastonishment, he sees it is \u221230\u00b0C. He concludes that this is\nthe least temperature to which he has been exposed ever. Ted\u2019s\nbelief about his personal record owes its justification to Ted\u2019s\nbelief that it is \u221230\u00b0C, justified by the evidence supplied\nby his smartphone, and Ted\u2019s acknowledging that if it is\n\u221230\u00b0C, then this is the least temperature to which he has\nbeen exposed ever. When one\u2019s belief that \\(q\\) derives its\njustification from the justification that one has for another belief\nthat \\(p\\) in this way, it has become customary to say that the\njustification for \\(p\\) transmits to \\(q\\) across the\ninferential link from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\).\n\nTransmission of justification across inference is a valuable and\nubiquitous epistemic phenomenon in everyday life and science. Thanks\nto epistemic transmission, inferential reasoning can substantiate\npredictions of future events and, more generally, can expand the\nsphere of our justified beliefs or reinforce the justification of\nbeliefs we already entertain. However, transmission of justification\nis not without exceptions. As some epistemologists have come to\nrealize, more or less trivial forms of circularity can prevent\njustification from transmitting from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) even if one has\njustification for \\(p\\) and one is aware of the inferential link from\n\\(p\\) to \\(q\\). In interesting cases this happens because one can\nacquire justification for \\(p\\) only if one has independent\njustification for \\(q\\). In this case the justification for \\(q\\)\ncannot depend on the justification for \\(p\\) and the inferential link\nfrom \\(p\\) to \\(q\\), as genuine transmission would require.\n\nThe phenomenon of transmission failure seems to shed light on\nphilosophical puzzles, such as Moore\u2019s proof of a material world\nand McKinsey\u2019s paradox, and it plays a central role in various\nphilosophical debates. For this reason it is granted continued and\nincreasing attention.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nArthur has the measles and stays in a closed environment with his\nsister Mafalda. If Mafalda ends up contracting the measles herself\nbecause of her staying in close contact with Arthur, there must be\nsomething\u2014the measles virus\u2014which is transmitted from\nArthur to Mafalda in virtue of a relation\u2014the relation of\nstaying in close contact with one another\u2014instantiated by the\ntwo siblings. Epistemologists have been devoting their attention to\nthe fact that epistemic properties\u2014like being justified\nor known\u2014are often transmitted in a similar way. An example (not\ndiscussed in this entry) is the transmission of knowledge via\ntestimony. A different but equally important phenomenon (which\noccupies center stage in this entry) is the transmission of epistemic\njustification across an inference or argument from one proposition to\nanother.\n\nConsider proposition \\(q\\) constituting the conclusion of an argument\nhaving proposition \\(p\\) as premise (where \\(p\\) can be a set or\nconjunction of propositions). If \\(p\\) is justified for a subject\n\\(s\\) by evidence \\(e\\), this justification may transmit to \\(q\\) if\n\\(s\\) is aware of the entailment between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). When this\nhappens, \\(q\\) is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of her\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential relation from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). Consider this example from\nWright (2002):\n\nToadstool\n\n\\(\\rE_1\\).\n Three hours ago, Jones inadvertently consumed a large risotto of\nBoletus Satana.\n\\(\\rP_1\\).\n Jones has absorbed a lethal quantity of the toxins that toadstool\ncontains.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_1\\).\n Jones will shortly die.\n\n\n\nHere \\(s\\) can deductively infer\n \\(\\rQ_1\\)\n from\n \\(\\rP_1\\)\n given background information.[1]\n Suppose \\(s\\) acquires justification for \\(\\rP_1\\) by learning\n \\(\\rE_1\\).\n \\( s\\) will also acquire justification for \\(\\rQ_1\\) in virtue of her\nknowledge of the inferential relation from \\(\\rP_1\\) to \\(\\rQ_1\\) and\nher justification for\n \\(\\rP_1\\).[2]\n Thus, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_1\\) will transmit to\n\\(\\rQ_1\\).\n\nIt is widely recognized that epistemic justification sometimes\nfails to transmit across an inference or argument. In\ninteresting cases of transmission failure, \\(s\\) has justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) and knows the inferential link between \\(p\\) and\n\\(q\\), but \\(s\\) has no justification for believing \\(q\\) in\nvirtue of her justification for \\(p\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential link. Here is an example from Wright (2003). Suppose\n\\(s\\)\u2019s background information entails that Jessica and Jocelyn\nare indistinguishable twins. Consider this possible reasoning:\n\nTwins\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\). \nThis girl looks just like Jessica.\n\\(\\rP_2\\).\n This girl is actually Jessica.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_2\\).\n This girl is not Jocelyn.\n\n\n\nIn Twins\n\\(\\rE_2\\)\n can give \\(s\\) justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n only if \\(s\\) has independent justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n in the first instance. Suppose that \\(s\\) does have independent\njustification for believing \\(\\rQ_2\\), and imagine that \\(s\\) learns\n\\(\\rE_2\\). In this case \\(s\\) will acquire justification for believing\n\\(\\rP_2\\) from \\(\\rE_2\\). But it is intuitive that \\(s\\) will acquire\nno justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in virtue of her justification\nfor believing \\(\\rP_2\\) based on \\(\\rE_2\\) and her knowledge of the\ninferential link between \\(\\rP_2\\) and \\(\\rQ_2\\). So, Twins\ninstantiates transmission failure when \\(\\rQ_2\\) is independently\njustified.\n\nAn argument incapable of transmitting to its conclusion a\nspecific justification for its premise(s)\u2014e.g., a\njustification based on evidence \\(e\\)\u2014may be able to transmit to\nthe same conclusion a different justification for its\npremise(s)\u2014e.g., one based on different evidence \\(e^*\\).\nReplace for instance\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n with \n\n\\(\\rE_2^*.\\)\n This girl\u2019s passport certifies she is Jessica.\n\n\nin Twins,\n \\(\\rE_2^*\\)\n can provide \\(s\\) with justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n even if \\(s\\) has no independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n Suppose then that \\(s\\) has no independent justification for\n\\(\\rQ_2\\), and that she acquires \\(\\rE_2^*\\). It is intuitive that\n\\(s\\) will acquire justification from \\(\\rE_2^*\\) for \\(\\rP_2\\) that\ndoes transmit to \\(\\rQ_2\\). Now the inference from \\(\\rP_2\\) to\n\\(\\rQ_2\\) instantiates epistemic transmission.\n\nAlthough many of the epistemologists participating in the debate on\nepistemic transmission and transmission failure speak of transmission\nof warrant, rather than justification, almost all of\nthem use the term \u2018warrant\u2019 to refer to some kind of\nepistemic justification (in\n Sect. 3.3\n we will however consider an account of warrant transmission failure\nin which \u2018warrant\u2019 is interpreted differently.) Most\nepistemologists investigating epistemic transmission and transmission\nfailure\u2014e.g., Wright (2011, 2007, 2004, 2003, 2002 and 1985),\nDavies (2003, 2000 and 1998), Dretske (2005), Pryor (2004), Moretti\n(2012) and Moretti & Piazza (2013)\u2014broadly identify the\nepistemic property capable of being transmitted with\npropositional\n justification.[3]\n Only a few authors explicitly focus on transmission of\ndoxastic justification\u2014e.g., Silins (2005), Davies\n(2009) and Tucker (2010a and 2010b\n [OIR]).\n In this entry we follow the majority in discussing transmission and\ntransmission failure of justification as phenomena primarily\npertaining to propositional justification. (See however the supplement\non\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n\nEpistemologists typically concentrate on transmission of\n(propositional or doxastic) justification across deductively\nvalid (given background information) arguments. The fact that\njustification can transmit across deduction is crucial for our\ncognitive processes because it makes the advancement of\nknowledge\u2014or justified belief\u2014through deductive reasoning\npossible. Suppose evidence \\(e\\) gives you justification for believing\nhypothesis \\(p\\), and you know that \\(p\\) entails another proposition\n\\(q\\) that you haven\u2019t directly checked. If the justification\nyou have for believing \\(p\\) transmits to its unchecked prediction\n\\(q\\) through the entailment, you acquire justification for believing\n\\(q\\) too.\n\nEpistemologists may analyze epistemic transmission across\ninductive (or ampliative) inferences too. Yet this\ntopic has received much less attention in the literature on epistemic\ntransmission. (See however interesting remarks in Tucker 2010a.) \n\nIn the remaining part of this entry we will focus on transmission and\ntransmission failure of propositional justification across deductive\ninference. Unless differently specified, by \u2018epistemic\njustification\u2019 or \u2018justification\u2019 we always mean\n\u2018propositional justification\u2019.\n2. Epistemic Transmission\n\nAs said, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on evidence \\(e\\)\ntransmits across entailment from \\(p\\) to \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence\n\\(q\\) whenever \\(q\\) is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) and her knowledge of\n\\(q\\)\u2019s deducibility from \\(p\\). This initial characterization\ncan be distilled into three conditions individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for epistemic transmission:\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(p\\)\u2019s logical consequence \\(q\\) if and only if:\n\n(C1)\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\),\n(C2)\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\) is deducible from \\(p\\),\n(C3)\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n\nCondition\n (C3)\n is crucial for distinguishing transmission of justification\nacross (known) entailment from closure of justification\nacross (known) entailment. Saying that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) is closed under \\(p\\)\u2019s (known) entailment to\n\\(q\\) is saying that:\n\n\nIf \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), then \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{c}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\).\n\n\n\nOne can coherently accept the above principle\u2014known as the\n principle of epistemic closure\u2014but\n deny a corresponding principle of epistemic transmission,\ncashed out in terms of the conditions outlined above:\n\n\nIf \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), then \n(C3)\n \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(q\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of (C1) and (C2).\n\n\n\nThe principle of epistemic closure just requires that when\n\\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p\\) and knows that \\(q\\) is\ndeducible from \\(p, s\\) have justification for believing \\(q\\). In\naddition, the principle of epistemic transmission requires\nthis justification to be had in virtue of her having justification for\n\\(p\\) and knowing that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\) (for further discussion see\nTucker 2010b\n [OIR]).\n\nAnother important distinction is the one between the principle of\nepistemic transmission and a different principle of transmission\ndiscussed by Pritchard (2012a) under the label of evidential\ntransmission principle. According to it,\n\n\nIf \\(s\\) perceptually knows that \\(p\\) in virtue of evidence set\n\\(e\\), and \\(s\\) competently deduces \\(q\\) from \\(p\\) (thereby coming\nto believe that \\(q\\) while retaining her knowledge that \\(p)\\), then\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\), where that knowledge is sufficiently supported\nby \\(e\\). (Pritchard 2012a: 75)\n\n\nPritchard\u2019s principle, to begin with, concerns (perceptual)\nknowledge and not propositional justification. Moreover, it deserves\nemphasis that there are inferences that apparently satisfy\nPritchard\u2019s principle but fail to satisfy the principle of\nepistemic transmission. Consider for instance the following\ntriad:\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pritchard, the evidence set of a normal zoo-goer standing\nbefore the zebra enclosure typically includes, above and beyond\n \\(\\rE_3\\),\n the background proposition that \n\n\\((\\rE_B)\\)\n to disguise mules like zebras would be very costly and\ntime-consuming, would bring no comparable benefit and would be\nrelatively easy to unmask.\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) knows\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n on the basis of her evidence set, and competently deduces\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n from \\(\\rP_3\\) thereby coming to believe \\(\\rQ_3\\). Pritchard\u2019s\nevidential transmission principle apparently accommodates the\nfact that \\(s\\) thereby comes to know \\(\\rQ_3\\). For her evidence\nset\u2014because of its inclusion of\n \\(\\rE_B\\)\u2014sufficiently\n supports \\(\\rQ_3\\). But the principle of epistemic\ntransmission is not satisfied. Although \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) and \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\nshe knows that \\(\\rP_3\\) entails \\(\\rQ_3\\), \n\n\nshe has justification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\) in virtue of, not\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)) and (C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)),\nbut the independent\nsupport lent to it by \\(\\rE_B\\).\n\nCondition\n (C3)\n suffices to distinguish the notion of epistemic transmission from\ndifferent notions in the neighborhood. However, as it stands, it is\nstill unsuitable for the purpose to completely characterize epistemic\ntransmission. The problem is that there are cases in which it is\nintuitive that the justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(q\\) even if (C3), strictly speaking, is not satisfied.\nThese cases can be described as situations in which only part\nof the justification that \\(s\\) has for \\(q\\) is based on her\njustification for \\(p\\) and her knowledge of the entailment from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q\\). Consider this example. Suppose you are traveling on a train\nheading to Edinburgh. At 16:00, as you enter Newcastle upon Tyne, you\nspot the train station sign. Then, at 16:05, the ticket controller\ntells you that you are not yet in Scotland. Now consider the following\nreasoning:\n\nJourney\n\n\\(\\rE_4\\).\n At 16:05 the ticket controller tells you that you are not yet in\nScotland.\n\\(\\rP_4\\).\n You are not yet in Scotland.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_4\\).\n You are not yet in Edinburgh.\n\n\n\nAs you learn\n \\(\\rE_4\\),\n given suitable background information, you get justification for\n \\(\\rP_4\\);\n moreover, to the extent to which you know that not being in Scotland\nis sufficient for not being in Edinburgh, you also acquire via\ntransmission justification for\n \\(\\rQ_4\\).\n This additional justification is transmitted irrespective of the fact\nthat you already have justification for \\(\\rQ_4\\), acquired\nby spotting the train station sign \u2018Newcastle upon Tyne\u2019.\nIf\n (C3)\n were read as requiring that the whole of the justification\navailable for a proposition \\(q\\) were had in virtue of the\nsatisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n cases like these would become invisible.\n\n\nA way to deal with this complication is to amend the tripartite\nanalysis of epistemic transmission by turning\n (C3)\n into (C3\\(^{+}\\)), saying that at least part of the\njustification that \\(s\\) has for \\(q\\) has been achieved by her in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n Let us say that a justification for \\(q\\) is an additional\njustification for \\(q\\) whenever it is not a first-time\njustification for it. Condition (C3\\(^{+}\\)) can be reformulated as\nthis disjunction:\n\n(C3\\(^{+}\\))\n \\(s\\) has first-time justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n\nor\n\n\\(s\\) has an additional justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n\nMuch of the extant literature on epistemic transmission concentrates\non examples of transmission of first-time justification. These\nexamples include\n Toadstool.\n We have seen, however, that what intuitively transmits in other cases\nis simply additional justification. Epistemologists have identified at\nleast two\u2014possibly overlapping\u2014kinds of additional\njustification (cf. Moretti & Piazza 2013).\n\nOne is what can be called independent justification because\nit appears\u2014intuitively\u2014independent of the original\njustification for \\(q\\). This notion of justification can probably be\nsharpened by appealing to counterfactual analysis. Suppose\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to\n\\(p\\)\u2019s logical consequence \\(q\\). This justification\ntransmitted to \\(q\\) is an additional independent\njustification just in case these three conditions are met: \n\n(IN1)\n\\(s\\) was already justified in believing \\(q\\) before acquiring\n\\(e\\), \n(IN2)\nas \\(s\\) acquires \\(e, s\\) is still justified in believing \\(q\\),\nand \n(IN3)\nif \\(s\\) had not been antecedently justified in believing \\(q\\),\nupon learning \\(e, s\\) would have acquired via transmission a\nfirst-time justification for believing \\(q\\). \n\n\nJourney\n instantiates transmission of justification by meeting\n (IN1),\n (IN2), and\n (IN3).\n Thus, Journey exemplifies a case of transmission of\nadditional independent justification.\n\nConsider now that justification for a proposition or belief normally\ncomes in degrees of strength. The second kind of additional\njustification can be characterized as quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. Suppose again that \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\) transmits to \\(p\\)\u2019s\nconsequence \\(q\\). This justification transmitted to \\(q\\) is an\nadditional quantitatively strengthening justification just in\ncase these two conditions are satisfied:\n\n(STR1)\n \\(s\\) was already justified in believing \\(q\\) before acquiring\n\\(e\\), and \n(STR2)\n as \\(s\\) acquires \\(e\\), the strength of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for believing \\(q\\) increases. \n\n\nHere is an example from Moretti (2012). Your background information\nsays that only one ticket out of 5,000 of a fair lottery has been\nbought by a person born in 1970, and that all other tickets have been\nbought by older or younger people. Consider now this reasoning:\n\nLottery\n\n\\(\\rE_5\\).\n The lottery winner\u2019s passport certifies she was born in\n1980.\n\\(\\rP_5\\).\n The lottery\u2019s winner was born in 1980.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_5\\).\n The lottery\u2019s winner was not born in 1970.\n\n\n\nGiven its high chance,\n \\(\\rQ_5\\)\n is already justified on your background information only. It is\nintuitive that as you learn\n \\(\\rE_5\\),\n you acquire an additional quantitatively strengthening justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_5\\) via transmission. For your justification for\n \\(\\rP_5\\)\n transmitted to \\(\\rQ_5\\) is intuitively quantitatively stronger than\nyour initial justification for \\(\\rQ_5\\).\n\nIn many cases when \\(q\\) receives via transmission from \\(p\\) an\nadditional independent justification, \\(q\\) also receives a\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This is not always true\nthough. For there seem to be cases in which an additional independent\njustification transmitted from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) intuitively\nlessens an antecedent justification for \\(q\\) (cf. Wright\n2011).\n\nAn interesting question is whether it is true that as \\(q\\) gets via\ntransmission from \\(p\\) an additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification, \\(q\\) also gets an independent justification. This\nseems true in some cases\u2014for instance in\n Lottery.\n It is controversial, however, if it is the case that\nwhenever \\(q\\) gets via transmission a quantitatively\nstrengthening justification, \\(q\\) also gets an independent\njustification. Wright (2011) and Moretti & Piazza (2013) describe\ntwo examples in which a subject allegedly receives via transmission a\nquantitatively strengthening but not independent additional\njustification.\n\nTo summarize, additional justification comes in two species\nat least: independent justification and quantitatively\nstrengthening justification. This enables us to lay down three\nspecifications of the general condition\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n necessary for justification transmission, each of which represents a\ncondition necessary for the transmission of one particular type of\njustification. Let\u2019s call these specifications\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}\\)),\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\)), and\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{aqs}}\\)).\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has first time justification for \\(q\\) in virtue\nof the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has additional independent justification for \\(q\\)\nin virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n \n\n\n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{aqs}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has additional quantitatively strengthening\njustification for \\(q\\) in virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2).\n \n\n\nTransmission of first-time justification makes the advancement of\njustified belief through deductive reasoning possible. Yet the\nacquisition of first-time justification for \\(q\\) isn\u2019t the sole\npossible improvement of one\u2019s epistemic position relative to\n\\(q\\) that one could expect from transmission of justification.\nMoretti & Piazza (2013), for instance, describe a variety of\ndifferent ways in which s\u2019s epistemic standing toward a\nproposition can be improved upon acquiring an additional justification\nfor it via transmission.\n\nWe conclude this section with a note about transmissivity as\nresolving doubts. Let us say that \\(s\\) doubts \\(q\\)\njust in case \\(s\\) either disbelieves or withholds\nbelief about \\(q\\), namely, refrains from both believing and\ndisbelieving \\(q\\) after deciding about \\(q\\). \\(s\\)\u2019s\ndoubting \\(q\\) should be distinguished from \\(s\\)\u2019s being\nopen minded about \\(q\\) and from \\(s\\)\u2019s having\nno doxastic attitude whatsoever towards \\(q\\) (cf. Tucker\n2010a). Let us say that a deductively valid argument from \\(p\\) to\n\\(q\\) is able to resolve doubt about its conclusion just in case it is\npossible for \\(s\\) to be rationally moved from doubting \\(q\\) to\nbelieving \\(q\\) solely in virtue of grasping the argument from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q\\) and the evidence offered for \\(p\\).\n\nSome authors (e.g., Davies 1998, 2003, 2004, 2009; McLaughlin 2000;\nWright 2002, 2003, 2007) have proposed that we should conceive of an\nargument\u2019s epistemic transmissivity in a way that is very\nclosely related or even identical to the argument\u2019s ability to\nresolve doubt about its conclusion. Whereas some of these authors have\neventually conceded that epistemic transmissivity cannot be defined as\nability to resolve doubt (e.g., Wright 2011), others have attempted to\narticulate this view in full (see mainly Davies 2003, 2004, 2009).\n\nHowever, there is nowadays wide agreement in the literature that the\nproperty of being a transmissive argument doesn\u2019t\ncoincide with the one of being an argument able to resolve doubt about\nits conclusion (see for example, Beebee 2001; Coliva 2010; Markie\n2005; Pryor 2004; Bergmann 2004, 2006; White 2006; Silins 2005; Tucker\n2010a). A good reason to think so is that whereas the property of\nbeing transmissive appears to be a genuinely epistemic\nproperty of an argument, the one of resolving doubt seems to be only a\ndialectical feature of it, which varies with the audience\nwhose doubt the argument is used to address.\n3. Failure of Epistemic Transmission\n3.1 Trivial Transmission Failure versus Non-Transmissivity\n\nIt is acknowledged that justification sometimes fails to transmit\nacross known entailment (the acknowledgment dates back at least to\nWright 1985). Moreover, it is no overstatement to say that the\nliterature has investigated transmission failure more extensively than\ntransmission of justification. As we have seen, justification based on\n\\(e\\) transmits from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) across the entailment if and only\nif \n\n(C1)\n \\(s\\) has justification for \\(p\\) based on \\(e\\), \n(C2)\n\\(s\\) knows that \\(q\\) is deducible from \\(p\\), and \n(C3\\(^{+}\\))\n at least part of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(q\\) is based\non the satisfaction of (C1) and (C2).\n\n\nIt follows from this characterization that no justification\nbased on e transmits from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) across the\nentailment if\n (C1),\n (C2), or\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n are not satisfied. These are cases of transmission failure.\n\nSome philosophers have argued that knowledge and justification are not\nalways closed under competent (single-premise or\nmultiple-premise) deduction. In the recent literature, the explanation\nof closure failure has often been essayed in terms of\nagglomeration of epistemic risk. This type of explanation is\nless controversial when applied to multi-premise deduction. An example\nof it concerning justification is the deduction from a high number\n\\(n\\) of premises, each of which specifies that a different ticket in\na fair lottery won\u2019t win, which are individually justified even\nthough each premise is somewhat risky, to the conclusion that\nnone of these \\(n\\) tickets will win, which is too risky to\nbe justified. (For more controversial cases in which knowledge or\njustification closure would fail across single-premise deduction\nbecause of risk accumulation, see for example Lasonen-Aarnio 2008 and\nSchechter 2013; for responses, see for instance Smith 2013 and 2016.)\nThese cases of failure of epistemic closure can be taken to also\ninvolve failure of justification transmission. For instance,\nit can be argued that even if \n\n(C1\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for each of the \\(n\\) premises stating\nthat a ticket won\u2019t win, and \n(C2\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that it follows from these premises that none of the\n\\(n\\) tickets will win, \n\n\n\\(s\\) has no justification\u2014and, therefore, no justification in\nvirtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1\\(^{*}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(^{*}\\))\u2014for\n believing that none of the \\(n\\) tickets will win. In these cases,\ntransmission failure appears to be a consequence of closure failure,\nand it is therefore natural to treat the former simply as a\nsymptomatic manifestation of the latter. For this reason, we will\nfollow the current literature on transmission failure in not\ndiscussing these cases. (For an analysis of closure failure, see the\nentry on\n epistemic closure,\n especially section 6.)\n\nThe current literature treats transmission failure as a self-standing\nphenomenon, in the sense that it focuses on cases in which\ntransmission failure is not imputed\u2014and thus not considered\nreducible\u2014to an underlying failure of closure. For the rest of\nthis entry, we shall follow suit and investigate transmission failure\nin this pure or genuine form.\n\nThe most trivial cases of transmission failure are such that\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is unsatisfied because\n (C1)\n or\n (C2)\n are unsatisfied, but it is also true that (C3\\(^{+}\\))\nwould have been satisfied if both\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n have been satisfied (cf. Tucker 2010b\n [OIR]).\n It deserves emphasis that these cases involve arguments that\naren\u2019t unsuitable for the purpose to transmit justification\ndepending on evidence \\(e\\): had the epistemic circumstances been\ncongenial to the satisfaction of\n (C1)\n and\n (C2),\n these arguments would have transmitted the justification based on\n\\(e\\) from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\). As we could put the point, these arguments\nare transmissive of the justification depending on\n \\(e\\).[4]\n\nCases of transmission failure of a more interesting variety are those\nin which, regardless of the validity of closure of justification,\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n isn\u2019t satisfied because it could not have been satisfied, no\nmatter whether or not\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n have been satisfied. These cases concern arguments\nnon-transmissive of justification depending on a given\nevidence, i.e., arguments incapable of transmitting justification\ndepending on that evidence under any epistemic circumstance. An\nexample in point is\n Twins.\n Suppose first that \\(s\\) has independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n In those circumstances \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n\n\nFurthermore \n\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) does know that\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n\n\nHowever, \\(s\\) hasn\u2019t justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in virtue of\nthe satisfaction of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)).\n So\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is not met. Suppose now that \\(s\\) has no independent justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_2\\). Then, it isn\u2019t the case that \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n \n\n\nSo,\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is not met either. Since there is no other possibility\u2014either\n\\(s\\) has independent justification for\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n or she doesn\u2019t\u2014it cannot be the case that \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbelief that \\(\\rQ_2\\) is justified in virtue of her\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n and her knowledge that \\(\\rP_2\\) entails \\(\\rQ_2\\).\n\nNote that none of the cases of transmission failure of justification\nconsidered above entails failure of epistemic closure. For in none of\nthese cases \\(s\\) has justification for believing \\(p, s\\) knows that\n\\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), and \\(s\\) fails to have justification for\nbelieving \\(q\\).\n\nUnsurprisingly, the epistemologists contributing to the literature on\ntransmission failure have principally devoted their attention to cases\ninvolving non-transmissive arguments. Epistemologists have endeavored\nto identify conditions whose satisfaction suffices to make an argument\nnon-transmissive of justification based on a given evidence.\nThe next section reviews the most influential of these proposals.\n3.2 Varieties of Non-Transmissive Arguments\n\nSome non-transmissive arguments explicitly feature their\nconclusion among their premises. Suppose \\(p\\) is justified for \\(s\\)\nby \\(e\\), and consider the premise-circular argument that deduces\n\\(p\\) from itself. This argument cannot satisfy\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n even if\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n are satisfied. The reason is that no part of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(p\\) can be acquired in virtue of, among\nother things, the satisfaction of\n (C2).\n For if\n (C1)\n is satisfied, \\(p\\) is justified for \\(s\\) by \\(e\\)\nindependently of \\(s\\)\u2019s knowledge of \\(p\\)\u2019s\nself-entailment, thus not in virtue of\n (C2).\n\nNon-transmissive arguments are not necessarily premise-circular. A\ndifferent source of non-transmissivity instantiating a subtler form of\ncircularity is the dependence of evidential relations on background or\ncollateral information. This type of dependence is a rather familiar\nphenomenon: the boiling of a kettle gives one justification for\nbelieving that the temperature of the liquid inside is approximately\n100\u00b0C only if one knows that the liquid is water and that\natmospheric pressure is the one of the sea-level. It doesn\u2019t if\none knows that the kettle is on the top of a high mountain, or the\nliquid is, say, sulfuric acid.\n\nWright argues, for instance, that the following epistemic set-up,\nwhich he calls the information-dependence template, suffices\nfor an argument\u2019s inability to transmit justification.\n\n\nA body of evidence, \\(e\\), is an information-dependent justification\nfor a particular proposition \\(p\\) if whether \\(e\\) justifies \\(p\\)\ndepends on what one has by way of collateral information, \\(i\\).\n[\u2026] Such a relationship is always liable to generate examples\nof transmission failure: it will do so just when the particular \\(e,\np\\), and \\(i\\) have the feature that needed elements of the relevant\n\\(i\\) are themselves entailed by \\(p\\) (together perhaps with other\nwarranted premises). In that case, any warrant supplied by \\(e\\) for\n\\(p\\) will not be transmissible to those elements of \\(i\\). (Wright\n2003: 59, edited.)\n\n\nThe claim that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\)\nrequires \\(s\\) to have background information \\(i\\) is customarily\nunderstood as equivalent (in this context) to the claim that\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) depends on some type\nof independent justification for believing or accepting\n \\(i\\).[5]\n\nInstantiating the information-dependence template appears\nsufficient for an argument\u2019s inability to transmit\nfirst-time justification. Consider again this triad:\n\nTwins\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\). \nThis girl looks just like Jessica.\n\\(\\rP_2\\).\n This girl is actually Jessica.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_2\\).\n This girl is not Jocelyn.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\)\u2019s background information entails that Jessica and\nJocelyn are indistinguishable twins. Imagine that \\(s\\) acquires\n \\(\\rE_2\\).\n It is intuitive that \\(\\rE_2\\) could justify\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n for \\(s\\) only if \\(s\\) had independent justification for\nbelieving\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n in the first instance. Thus, Twins instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template. Note that \\(s\\) acquires\nfirst-time justification for \\(\\rQ_2\\) in Twins only if \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rE_2\\)\n gives her justification for\n \\(\\rP_2\\),\n \n\n\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_2\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\n and\n\n\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nin virtue of\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)).\n \n\n\nThe satisfaction of\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n requires \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nnot to be independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from\n \\(\\rE_2\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_2\\).\n However, if\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n is true, the informational-dependence template requires\n\\(s\\) to have justification for believing \\(\\rQ_2\\)\nindependently of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(\\rE_2\\)\nfor \\(\\rP_2\\). Thus, when the information-dependence template\nis instantiated,\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Twins}}\\))\n and (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Twins}}\\)) cannot be satisfied at\nonce. In general, no argument satisfying this template together with a\ngiven evidence will be transmissive of first-time justification based\non that evidence.\n\nOne may wonder whether a deductive argument from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\)\ninstantiating the information-dependence template is unable\nto transmit additional justification for \\(q\\). The answer\nseems affirmative when the additional justification is\nindependent justification. Suppose the\ninformation-dependence template is instantiated such that\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) from \\(e\\) depends on\n\\(s\\)\u2019s independent justification for \\(q\\). Note that \\(s\\)\nacquires additional independent justification for \\(q\\) only if \n\n(C1)\n \\(e\\) gives her justification for \\(p\\), \n(C2)\n \\(s\\) knows that \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\), and \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ai}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires an additional independent justification in virtue\nof (C1) and (C2).\n\n\nThis additional justification is independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s\nantecedent justification for \\(q\\) only if, in particular, condition\n (IN3)\n of the characterization of additional independent justification is\nsatisfied. (IN3) says that if \\(s\\) had not been antecedently\njustified in believing \\(q\\), upon learning \\(e, s\\) would have\nacquired via transmission a first-time justification for believing\n\\(q\\). (IN3) entails that if \\(q\\) were not antecedently justified for\n\\(s, e\\) would still justify \\(p\\) for \\(s\\). Hence, the satisfaction\nof (IN3) is incompatible with the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template, which entails that if \\(s\\)\nhad not antecedent justification for \\(q, e\\) would not\njustify \\(p\\) for \\(s\\). The instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template then precludes transmission\nof independent justification.\n\nAs suggested by Wright (2007), the instantiation of the\ninformation-dependence template might also appear sufficient\nfor an argument\u2019s inability to transmit additional\nquantitatively strengthening justification. This claim might\nappear intuitively plausible: perhaps it is reasonable that if the\njustification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) depends on independent\njustification for another proposition \\(q\\), the strength of the\njustification available for \\(q\\) sets an upper bound to the strength\nof the justification possibly supplied by \\(e\\) for \\(p\\). However,\nthe examples by Wright (2011) and Moretti & Piazza (2013)\nmentioned in\n Sect. 2\n appear to undermine this intuition. For they involve arguments that\ninstantiate the information-dependent template yet seem to\ntransmit quantitatively strengthening justification to their\nconclusions. (Alspector-Kelly 2015 suggests that these arguments are a\nsymptom that Wright\u2019s explanation of non-transmissivity is\noverall inadequate.) \n\nSome authors have attempted Bayesian formalizations of the\ninformation dependence template (see the supplement on\n Bayesian Formalizations of the Information-Dependence Template.)\n Furthermore, Coliva (2012) has proposed a variant of the same\ntemplate. In accordance with the information-dependence\ntemplate, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) fails\nto transmit to \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence \\(q\\) whenever \\(s\\)\u2019s\npossessing that justification for \\(p\\) requires \\(s\\)\u2019s\nindependent justification for \\(q\\). According to Coliva\u2019s\nvariant, \\(s\\)\u2019s justification from \\(e\\) for \\(p\\) fails to\ntransmit to \\(q\\) whenever \\(s\\)\u2019s possessing the latter\njustification for \\(p\\) requires \\(s\\)\u2019s independent\nassumption of \\(q\\), whether this assumption is justified\nor not. Pryor (2012: \u00a7 VII) can be read as pressing\nobjections against Coliva\u2019s template, which are addressed in\nColiva (2012).\n\nWe have seen that non-transmissivity may depend on premise-circularity\nor reliance on collateral information. There is at least a third\npossibility: an argument can be non-transmissive of the justification\nfor its premise(s) based on given evidence because the evidence\njustifies directly the conclusion\u2014i.e.,\nindependently of the argument itself (cf. Davies 2009). In\nthis case the argument instantiates indirectness, for\n\\(s\\)\u2019s going through the argument would result in nothing but\nan indirect (and unneeded) detour for justifying its conclusion. If\n\\(e\\) directly justifies \\(q\\), no part of the justification for \\(q\\)\nis based on, among other things, \\(s\\)\u2019s knowledge of the\ninferential relation between \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So\n (C3\\(^{+}\\))\n is unfulfilled whether or not\n (C1)\n and\n (C2)\n are fulfilled. Here is an example from Wright (2002):\n\nSoccer\n\n\\(\\rE_6\\).\n Jones has just kicked the ball between the white posts.\n\\(\\rP_6\\).\n Jones has just scored a goal.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_6\\).\n A game of soccer is taking place.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) learns evidence\n \\(\\rE_6\\).\n On ordinary background information, \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rE_6\\)\n justifies\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n for \\(s\\), \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_6\\),\n and\n \\(\\rE_6\\)\n also justifies\n \\(\\rQ_6\\)\n for \\(s\\).\n\n\nIt seems false, however, that\n \\(\\rQ_6\\)\n is justified for \\(s\\) in virtue of the satisfaction of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)).\n Quite the reverse, \\(\\rQ_6\\) seems justified for \\(s\\) by\n \\(\\rE_6\\)\n independently the satisfaction of (C1\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)) and\n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Socc}}\\)). This is so because in the (imagined) actual\nscenario it seems true that \\(s\\) would still possess a justification\nfor \\(\\rQ_6\\) based on \\(\\rE_6\\) even if \\(\\rE_6\\) did not\njustify\n \\(\\rP_6\\)\n for \\(s\\). In fact suppose \\(s\\) had noticed that the referee\u2019s\nassistant raised her flag to signal Jones\u2019s off-side. Against\nthis altered background information, \\(\\rE_6\\) would no longer justify\n\\(\\rP_6\\) for \\(s\\) but it would still justify \\(\\rQ_6\\) for \\(s\\).\nThus, Soccer is non-transmissive of the justification\ndepending on \\(\\rE_6\\). In general, no argument instantiating\nindirectness in relation to some evidence is transmissive of\njustification based on that evidence.\n\nThe information-dependence template and indirectness\nare diagnostics for a deductive argument\u2019s inability to transmit\nthe justification for its premise(s) \\(p\\) based on evidence \\(e\\) to\nits conclusion \\(q\\), where \\(e\\) is conceived of as a\nbelieved proposition capable of supplying\ninferential and (typically) fallible justification\nfor \\(p\\). (Note that even though \\(e\\) is conceived of as a belief,\nthe collateral information \\(i\\), which is part of the\ntemplate, doesn\u2019t need to be believed on some views.)\nThe justification for a proposition \\(p\\) might come in other forms.\nFor instance, it has been proposed that a proposition \\(p\\) about the\nperceivable environment around the subject \\(s\\) can be justified by\nthe fact that \\(s\\) sees that \\(p\\) (where\n\u2018sees\u2019 is taken to be factive). In this case,\n\\(s\\) is claimed to attain a kind of non-inferential and\ninfallible justification for believing \\(p\\). This view has\nbeen explored by epistemological disjunctivists (see for\ninstance McDowell 1982, 1994 and 2008, and Pritchard 2007, 2008, 2009,\n2011 and 2012a).\n\nOne might find it intuitively plausible that when \\(s\\) sees that \\(p,\ns\\) attains non-inferential and infallible justification for believing\n\\(p\\) that doesn\u2019t rely on \\(s\\)\u2019s background information.\nSince this justification for believing \\(p\\) would be a\nfortiori unconstrained by \\(s\\)\u2019s independent justification\nfor believing any consequence \\(q\\) of \\(p\\), in these cases the\ninformation-dependence template could not possibly be instantiated.\nTherefore, one might be tempted to conclude that when \\(s\\) sees that\n\\(p, s\\) acquires a justification that typically transmits to the\npropositions that \\(s\\) knows to be deducible from \\(p\\) (cf. Wright\n2002). Pritchard (2009, 2012a) comes very close to endorsing this view\nexplicitly.\n\nThe latter contention has not stayed unchallenged. Suppose one accepts\na notion of epistemic justification with internalist\nresonances saying that a factor \\(J\\) is relevant to \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification only if \\(s\\) is able to determine, by reflection alone,\nwhether \\(J\\) is or is not realized. On this notion, \\(s\\)\u2019s\nseeing that \\(p\\) cannot provide \\(s\\) with justification for\nbelieving \\(p\\) unless \\(s\\) can rationally claim that she is\nseeing that \\(p\\) upon reflection alone. Seeing that \\(p\\),\nhowever, is subjectively indistinguishable from hallucinating\nthat \\(p\\), or from being in some other delusional state in which it\nmerely seems to \\(s\\) that she is seeing that \\(p\\). Hence,\none may find it compelling that \\(s\\) can claim by reflection alone\nthat she\u2019s seeing that \\(p\\) only if \\(s\\) has an independent\nreason for ruling out that it merely seems to her that she does (cf.\nWright 2011). If this is true, for many deductive arguments from \\(p\\)\nto \\(q, s\\) won\u2019t be able to acquire non-inferential and\ninfallible justification for believing \\(p\\) of the type described by\nthe disjunctivist and transmit it to \\(q\\). This will happen whenever\n\\(q\\) is the logical negation of a proposition ascribing to \\(s\\) some\ndelusionary mental state in which it merely seems to her that she\ndirectly perceives that \\(p\\).\n\nWright\u2019s disjunctive template is meant to be a\ndiagnostic of transmission failure of non-inferential justification\nwhen epistemic justification is conceived of in the internalist\nfashion suggested\n above.[6]\n According to Wright (2000), for any propositions \\(p, q\\) and \\(r\\)\nand subject \\(s\\), the disjunctive template is instantiated\nwhenever: \n\n(D1)\n \\(p\\) entails \\(q\\);\n(D2)\n \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(p\\) consists in \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbeing in a state subjectively indistinguishable from a state in which\n\\(r\\) would be true;\n(D3)\n \\(r\\) is incompatible with \\(p\\);\n(D4)\n \\(r\\) would be true if \\(q\\) were false.\n\n\nTo see how this template works, consider again the following\ntriad:\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\nThe justification from\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n arguably fails to transmit across the inference from \\(\\rP_3\\) to\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n because of the satisfaction of the information-dependence\ntemplate. For it seems true that \\(s\\) could acquire a\njustification for believing \\(\\rP_3\\) on the basis of \\(\\rE_3\\) only\nif \\(s\\) had an independent justification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\). Now\nsuppose that \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) is based on,\nnot \\(\\rE_3\\) but \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\).\nLet\u2019s call Zebra* the corresponding variant of\nZebra. Given the non-inferential nature of the\njustification considered for \\(\\rP_3\\), Zebra* could not\ninstantiate the information-dependence template. However, it\nis easy to check that Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate. To begin with, \n\n(D1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n\n\\(\\rP_3\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_3\\);\n \n(D2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), which is\nsubjectively indistinguishable from the state that \\(s\\) would be in\nif it were true that\n\n\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\).\n the animals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised to look like\nzebras; \n\n(D3\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)\n is incompatible with\n \\(\\rP_3\\);\n and, trivially, \n(D4\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n if\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n were false\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)\n would be true.\n\n\nSince Zebra* instantiates the disjunctive template,\nit is non-transmissive of at least first-time justification.\nIn fact note that \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n in this case if and only if \n\n(C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) has justification for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n based on seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), \n(C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) knows that\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_3\\),\n and \n(C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n \\(s\\) acquires first-time justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n in virtue of\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n and\n (C2\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)).\n \n\n\nAlso note that\n (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n requires \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for believing\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\nnot to be independent of \\(s\\)\u2019s justification for\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n based on seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\). However, if\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n is true, the disjunctive template requires \\(s\\) to have\njustification for believing \\(\\rQ_3\\) independent of\n\\(s\\)\u2019s justification for \\(\\rP_3\\) based on her seeing that\n\\(\\rP_3\\). (For if \\(s\\) could not independently exclude that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\) is false, given (D4), (D3) and (D2), \\(s\\) could not exclude\nthat the incompatible alternative \\(\\rR_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\) to\n\\(\\rP_3\\), which \\(s\\) cannot subjectively distinguish from \\(\\rP_3\\)\non the ground of her seeing that \\(\\rP_3\\), is true.) Thus, when the\ndisjunctive template is instantiated,\n (C1\\(_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\))\n and (C3\\(^{\\textrm{ft}}_{\\textit{Zebra}}\\)) cannot be satisfied at\nonce.\n\nThe disjunctive template has been criticized by McLaughlin (2003) on\nthe ground that the template is instantiated whenever the\njustification for \\(p\\) is fallible, i.e. compatible with\n\\(p\\)\u2019s falsity. Here is an example from Brown (2004). Take this\ndeductive argument:\n\nFox\n\n\\(\\rP_7\\).\n The animal in the garbage is a fox.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_7\\).\n The animal in the garbage is not a cat.\n\n\n\nSuppose \\(s\\) has a fallible justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_7\\)\n based on \\(s\\)\u2019s experience as if the animal in the\ngarbage is a fox. Take now \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) to be\n\\(\\rP_7\\)\u2019s logical negation. Since the justification that \\(s\\)\nhas for \\(\\rP_7\\) is fallible, condition\n (D2)\n above is met by default. As one can easily check, conditions\n (D1),\n (D3), and\n (D4)\n are also met. So,\n Fox\n instantiates the disjunctive template. Yet it is intuitive\nthat Fox does transmit justification to its conclusion.\n\nOne could respond to McLaughlin that his objection is misplaced\nbecause the disjunctive template is meant to apply to\ninfallible, and not fallible, justification. A more\ninteresting response to McLaughlin is to refine some condition listed\nin the disjunctive template to block McLaughlin\u2019s\nargument while letting this template account for transmission failure\nof both fallible and infallible justification. Wright (2011) for\ninstance suggests replacing\n (D3)\n with the following\n condition:[7]\n\n(D3\\(^{*}\\))\n \\(r\\) is incompatible with some presupposition of the cognitive\nproject of obtaining justification for \\(p\\) in the relevant\nfashion.\n\n\nAccording to Wright\u2019s (2011) characterization, a presupposition\nof a cognitive project is any condition such that doubting it before\ncarrying out the project would rationally commit one to doubting the\nsignificance or competence of the project irrespective of its\n outcome.[8]\n For a wide class of cognitive projects, examples of these\npresuppositions include: the normal and proper functioning of the\nrelevant cognitive faculties, the reliability of utilized instruments,\nthe obtaining of the circumstances congenial to the proposed method of\ninvestigation, the soundness of relevant principles of inference\nutilized in developing and collating one\u2019s results, and so\non.\n\nWith\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n in the place of\n (D3),\n Fox no longer instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate. For the truth of \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\), stating that\nthe animal in the garbage is not a fox, appears to jeopardize no\npresupposition of the cognitive project of obtaining perceptual\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_7\\).\n Thus (D3\\(^{*}\\)) is not fulfilled. On the other hand, arguments that\nintuitively don\u2019t transmit do satisfy (D3\\(^{*}\\)). Take\nZebra*. In this case \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) states that the\nanimals in the pen are mules cleverly disguised to look like zebras.\nSince \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) entails that conditions are unsuitable\nfor attaining perceptual justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) looks incompatible with a presupposition of\nthe cognitive project of obtaining perceptual justification for\n\\(\\rP_3\\). Thus, \\(\\rR_{\\textit{fox}}\\) does satisfy (D3\\(^{*}\\)) in\nthis case.\n3.3 Non-Standard Accounts\n\nIn this section we outline two interesting branches in the literature\non transmission failure of justification and warrant across valid\ninference. We start with Smith\u2019s (2009) non-standard account of\nnon-transmissivity of justification. Then, we present\nAlspector-Kelly\u2019s (2015) account of non-transmissivity of\nPlantinga\u2019s warrant.\n\nAccording to Smith (2009), epistemic justification requires\nreliability. \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that \\(p\\), held on the\nbasis of \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that \\(e\\), is reliable in Smith\u2019s\nsense just in case in all possible worlds including \\(e\\) as true and\nthat are as normal (from the perspective of the actual world)\nas the truth of \\(e\\) permits, \\(p\\) is also true. Consider\n Zebra\n again.\n\nZebra\n\n\\(\\rE_3\\).\n The animals in the pen look like zebras.\n\\(\\rP_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are zebras.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\).\n The animals in the pen are not mules cleverly disguised to look\nlike zebras.\n\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s belief that\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n is reliable in Smith\u2019s sense when it is based on \\(s\\)\u2019s\nbelief that\n \\(\\rE_3\\).\n (Disguising mules to make them look like zebras is certainly an\nabnormal practice.) Thus, all possible \\(\\rE_3\\)-worlds that\nare as normal as the truth of \\(\\rE_3\\) permits aren\u2019t worlds in\nwhich the animals in the pen are cleverly disguised mules. Rather,\nthey are \\(\\rP_3\\)-worlds\u2014i.e., worlds in which the animals in\nthe pen are zebras.\n\nSmith describes two ways in which a belief can possess this property\nof being reliable. One is that a belief that \\(p\\) has it in virtue of\nthe modal relationship with its basis \\(e\\). In this case, \\(e\\) is a\ncontributing reliable basis. Another possibility is when it is the\ncontent of the belief that \\(p\\), rather than the belief\u2019s modal\nrelationship with its basis \\(e\\), that guarantees by itself the\nbelief\u2019s reliability. In this case, \\(e\\) is a non-contributing\nreliable basis. An example of the first kind is \\(s\\)\u2019s belief\nthat\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n which is reliable because of its modal relationship with\n \\(\\rE_3\\).\n There are obviously many sufficiently normal worlds in which\n\\(\\rP_3\\) is false, but no sufficiently normal world in which\n\\(\\rP_3\\) is false and \\(\\rE_3\\) true. An example of the second kind\nis \\(s\\)\u2019s belief that\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n as based on \\(\\rE_3\\). It is this belief\u2019s content, and not its\nmodal relationship with \\(\\rE_3\\), that guarantees its reliability. As\nSmith puts it, there are no sufficiently normal worlds in which\n\\(\\rE_3\\) is true and \\(\\rQ_3\\) is false, but this is simply because\nthere are no sufficiently normal worlds in which \\(\\rQ_3\\) is\nfalse.\n\nAccording to Smith, a deductive inference from \\(p\\) to \\(q\\) fails to\ntransmit to \\(q\\) justification relative to \\(p\\)\u2019s basis \\(e\\),\nif \\(e\\) is a contributing reliable basis for believing \\(p\\) but is a\nnon-contributing reliable basis for believing \\(q\\). In this case the\ninference fails to explain \\(q\\)\u2019s reliability: if\n\\(s\\) deduced one proposition from another, she would reliably believe\n\\(q\\), but not\u2014not even in part\u2014in virtue of having\ninferred \\(q\\) from \\(p\\) (as held on the basis of \\(e)\\).\nZebra fails to transmit to\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n justification relative to\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\u2019s\n basis\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n in this\n sense.[9]\n\nLet\u2019s turn to Alspector-Kelly (2015). As we have seen,\nWright\u2019s analysis of failure of warrant transmission interprets\nthe epistemic good whose transmission is in question as, roughly, the\nsame as epistemic\n justification.[10]\n By so doing, Wright departs from Plantinga\u2019s (1993a, 1993b)\ninfluential understanding of warrant as the epistemic quality that\n(whatever it is) suffices to turn true belief into knowledge. One\nmight wonder, however, if there are deductive arguments incapable of\ntransmitting warrant in Plantinga\u2019s sense. (Hereafter we use\n\u2018warrant\u2019 only to refer to Plantinga\u2019s warrant.)\nAlspector-Kelly answers this question affirmatively contending that\ncertain arguments cannot transmit warrant because the cognitive\nproject of establishing their conclusion via inferring it from their\npremise is procedurally self-defeating.\n\nAlspector-Kelly follows Wright (2012) in characterizing a cognitive\nproject as a pair of a question and a procedure that one executes to\nanswer the question. An enabling condition of a cognitive\nproject is, for Alspector-Kelly, any proposition such that, unless it\nis true, one cannot learn the answer to its defining question by\nexecuting the procedure associated with it. That a given object \\(o\\)\nis illuminated, for example, is an enabling condition of the cognitive\nproject of determining its color by looking at it. For one cannot\nlearn by sight that \\(o\\) is of a given color unless \\(o\\) is\nilluminated.\n\nEnabling conditions can be opaque. An enabling condition of a\ncognitive project is opaque, relative to some actual or possible\nresult, if it is the case that whenever the execution of the\nassociated procedure yields this result, it would have produced the\nsame result had the condition been unfulfilled. The enabling condition\nthat \\(o\\) be illuminated of the cognitive project just considered is\nnot opaque, since looking at \\(o\\) never produces the same response\nabout \\(o\\)\u2019s color when \\(o\\) is illuminated and when it\nisn\u2019t. (In the second case, it produces no\nresponse.)\n\nNow consider the cognitive project of establishing by sight whether\n (\\(\\rP_3)\\)\n the animals enclosed in the pen are zebras. An enabling condition of\nthis project states that\n (\\(\\rQ_3)\\)\n the animals in the pen are not mules disguised to look like zebras.\nFor one couldn\u2019t learn whether \\(\\rP_3\\) is true by looking, if\n\\(\\rQ_3\\)were true. \\(\\rQ_3\\) is opaque with respect to the possible\noutcome that \\(\\rP_3\\). In fact, suppose \\(\\rQ_3\\) is satisfied\nbecause the pen contains (undisguised) zebras. In this case, looking\nat them will attest they are zebras, and the execution of the\nprocedure associated with this project will yield the outcome that\n\\(\\rP_3\\). But this is exactly the outcome that would be generated by\nthe execution of the same procedure if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were not\nsatisfied. In this case too, looking at the animals would produce the\nresponse that \\(\\rP_3\\).\n\nWe can now elucidate the notion of a procedurally\nself-defeating cognitive project. The distinguishing feature of\nany project of this type is that it seeks to answer the question\nwhether an opaque enabling condition\u2014call it\n\u2018\\(q\\)\u2019\u2014of the project itself is fulfilled. A\nproject of this type has the defect that it necessarily produces the\nresponse that \\(q\\) is fulfilled when \\(q\\) is unfulfilled. Given\nthis, it is intuitive that it cannot yield warrant to believe\n\\(q\\).\n\nAs an example of a procedurally self-defeating project, consider\ntrying to answer the question whether your informant is sincere by\nasking her this very question. Your informant\u2019s being\nsincere is an enabling condition of the very project you are carrying\nout. If your informant were not sincere, you couldn\u2019t learn\nanything from her. This condition is also opaque with respect to the\npossible response that she is sincere. For your informant would\nrespond that she is sincere both in case she is so and in case she\nisn\u2019t. Since the execution of this project is guaranteed to\nyield the result that your informant is sincere when she isn\u2019t,\nit is intuitive that it cannot yield warrant to believe that the\ninformant is sincere.\n\nAlspector-Kelly contends that arguments like Zebra\ndon\u2019t transmit warrant because the cognitive project of\ndetermining inferentially whether their conclusion is true is\nprocedurally self-defeating in the sense advertised. Let\u2019s apply\nthe explanation to Zebra.\n\nImagine you carry out Zebra. This initially commits you to\nexecuting the project of establishing whether\n \\(\\rP_3\\)\n by looking. Suppose you get\n \\(\\rE_3\\)\n and hence \\(\\rP_3\\) as an outcome. As we have seen,\n \\(\\rQ_3\\)\n is an opaque enabling condition relative to the outcome \\(\\rP_3\\) of\nthe cognitive project you have executed. Imagine that now, having\nreceived \\(\\rP_3\\) as a response to your first question, you embark in\nthe second project which carrying out Zebra commits you to:\nestablishing whether \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true by inference from \\(\\rP_3\\).\nThis project appears doomed.\n\n\\(\\rQ_3\\)\n is an enabling condition of the initial project of determining\nwhether\n \\(\\rP_3\\),\n which is opaque with respect to the very premise \\(\\rP_3\\).\nIt follows from this that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is also an enabling condition of\nthe second project. For if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were unfulfilled, you\ncouldn\u2019t learn \\(\\rP_3\\) and, a fortiori, you\ncouldn\u2019t learn anything else\u2014\\(\\rQ_3\\) included\u2014by\ninference from \\(\\rP_3\\). Another consequence is that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is an\nenabling condition of the second project that is opaque\nrelative to the very outcome that \\(\\rQ_3\\). Suppose first that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\) is true and that, having visually inspected the pen, you\nhave verified \\(\\rP_3\\). You then execute the inferential procedure\nassociated with the second project and produce the outcome that\n\\(\\rQ_3\\). Now consider the case in which \\(\\rQ_3\\) is false. Looking\ninto the pen still generates the outcome that \\(\\rP_3\\) is true. Thus,\nwhen you execute the procedure associated with the second project, you\nstill infer that \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true. Since you would get the result\nthat \\(\\rQ_3\\) is true even if \\(\\rQ_3\\) were false, the second\nproject is procedurally self-defeating. In conclusion, carrying out\nZebra commits you to executing a project that cannot generate\nwarrant for believing its conclusion \\(\\rQ_3\\). This explanation of\nnon-transmissivity generalizes to all structurally similar\narguments.\n4. Applications\n\nThe notions of transmissive and non-transmissive argument, above and\nbeyond being investigated for their own sake, have been put to work in\nrelation to specific philosophical problems and issues. An important\nproblem is whether Moore\u2019s infamous proof of an external world\nis successful, and whether so are structurally similar Moorean\narguments directed against the perceptual skeptic and\u2014more\nrecently\u2014the non-believer. Another issue pertains to the\nsolution of McKinsey paradox. A third issue concerns\nBoghossian\u2019s (2001, 2003) explanation of our logical knowledge\nvia implicit definitions, criticized as resting on a non-transmissive\nargument schema (see for instance Ebert 2005 and Jenkins 2008). As the\ndebate focusing on the last topic is only at an early stage of its\ndevelopment, it is preferable to concentrate on the first two, which\nwill be reviewed in respectively\n Sect. 4.1\n and\n Sect. 4.2\n below.\n4.1 Moorean Proofs, Perceptual Justification and Religious Justification\n\nMuch of the contemporary debate on Moore\u2019s proof of an external\nworld (see Moore 1939) is interwoven with the topic of epistemic\ntransmission and its failure. Moore\u2019s proof can be reconstructed\nas follows:\n\nMoore\n\n\\(\\rE_8\\).\n My experience is in all respects as of a hand held up in front of\nmy face.\n\\(\\rP_8\\).\n Here is a hand.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_8\\).\n There is a material world (since any hand is a material object\nexisting in space).\n\n\n\nEvidence\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n in Moore is constituted by a proposition believed\nby \\(s\\). One might suggest, however, that this is a misinterpretation\nof Moore\u2019s proof (and variants of it that we shall consider\nshortly). One might argue that what is meant to give \\(s\\)\njustification for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is \\(s\\)\u2019s experience of a hand. Nevertheless, most of\nthe epistemologists participating in this debate implicitly or\nexplicitly assume that one\u2019s experience as if \\(p\\) and\none\u2019s belief that one has an experience as if \\(p\\) have the\nsame justifying power (cf. White 2006 and Silins 2007).\n\nMany philosophers find Moore\u2019s proof unsuccessful. Philosophers\nhave proposed explanations of this impression according to which\nMoore is non-transmissive in some of the senses described in\n Sect. 3\n (see mainly Wright 1985, 2002, 2007 and\n 2011).[11]\n A different explanation is that Moore\u2019s proof does\ntransmit justification but is dialectically ineffective (see mainly\nPryor 2004).\n\nAccording to Wright, there exist cornerstone propositions (or\nsimply cornerstones), where \\(c\\) is a cornerstone for an\narea of discourse \\(d\\) just in case for any proposition \\(p\\)\nbelonging to \\(d, p\\) could not be justified for any subject \\(s\\) if\n\\(s\\) had no independent justification for accepting \\(c\\) (see mainly\nWright\n 2004).[12]\n Cornerstones for the area of discourse about perceivable things are\nfor instance the logical negations of skeptical conjectures,\nsuch as the proposition that one\u2019s experiences are nothing but\none\u2019s hallucinations caused by a Cartesian demon or the Matrix.\nWright contends that the conclusion\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n of Moore is also a cornerstone for the area of discourse\nabout perceivable things. Adapting terminology introduced by Pryor\n(2004), Wright\u2019s conception of the architecture of perceptual\njustification thus treats \\(\\rQ_8\\) conservatively with\nrespect to any perceptual hypothesis \\(p\\): if \\(s\\) had no\nindependent justification for \\(\\rQ_8\\), no proposition \\(e\\)\ndescribing an apparent perception could supply \\(s\\) with prima\nfacie justification for any perceptual hypothesis \\(p\\). It\nfollows from this that Moore instantiates the\ninformation-dependence template considered in\n Sect. 3.2.\n For \\(\\rQ_8\\) is part of the collateral information which \\(s\\) needs\nindependent justification for if \\(s\\) is to receive some\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n from\n \\(\\rE_8\\).\n Hence Moore is non-transmissive (see mainly Wright 2002).\nNote that the thesis that Moore\u2019s proof is epistemologically\nuseless because non-transmissive in this sense is compatible with the\nclaim that by learning \\(\\rE_8, s\\) does acquire a justification for\nbelieving \\(\\rP_8\\). For instance, Wright (2004) contends that we all\nhave a special kind of non-evidential justification, which he\ncalls entitlement, for accepting \\(\\rQ_8\\) as well as other\ncornerstones in\n general.[13]\n So, by learning \\(\\rE_8\\) we do acquire justification for \\(\\rP_8\\).\nWright\u2019s analysis of Moore\u2019s proof and Wright\u2019s\nconservatism have mostly been criticized in conjunction with his\ntheory of entitlement. A presentation of these objections is beyond\nthe scope of this entry. (See however Davies 2004; Pritchard 2005;\nJenkins 2007. For a defense of Wright\u2019s views see for instance\nNeta 2007 and Wright 2014.)\n\nAs anticipated, other philosophers contend that Moore\u2019s proof\ndoes transmit justification and that its ineffectiveness has a\ndifferent explanation. An important conception of the architecture of\nperceptual justification, called dogmatism in Pryor (2000,\n2004), embraces a generalized form of liberalism about\nperceptual justification. This form of liberalism is opposed to\nWright\u2019s conservatism, and claims that to have\nprima facie perceptual justification for believing \\(p\\) from\nan apparent perception that \\(p, s\\) doesn\u2019t need independent\njustification for believing the negation of skeptical conjectures or\nnon-perceiving hypotheses like \\(\\notQ_8\\). This is so, for the\ndogmatist, because our experiences give us immediate and\nprima facie justification for believing their contents.\nSaying that perceptual justification is immediate is saying that it\ndoesn\u2019t presuppose\u2014not even in part\u2014justification\nfor anything else. Saying that justification is prima facie is saying\nthat it can be defeated by additional evidence. Our perceptual\njustification would be defeated, for example, by evidence that a\nrelevant non-perceiving hypothesis is true or just as probable as its\nnegation. For instance, \\(s\\)\u2019s perceptual justification for\n\\(\\rP_8\\) would be defeated by evidence that \\(\\notQ_8\\) is true, or\nthat\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n and \\(\\notQ_8\\) are equally probable. On this point the dogmatist and\nWright do agree. They disagree on whether \\(s\\)\u2019s perceptual\njustification for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n requires independent justification for believing or accepting\n\\(\\rQ_8\\). The dogmatist denies that \\(s\\) needs that independent\njustification. Thus, according to the dogmatist, Moore\u2019s proof\ntransmits the perceptual justification available for its\npremise to the\n conclusion.[14]\n\nThe dogmatist argues (or may argue), however, that Moore\u2019s proof\nis dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor 2004). The contention is\nthat Moore\u2019s is unsuccessful because it is useless for the\npurpose to convince the idealist or the external world skeptic that\nthere is an external (material) world. In short, neither the idealist\nnor the global skeptic believes that there is an external world. Since\nthey don\u2019t believe\n \\(\\rQ_8\\),\n they are rationally required to distrust any perceptual\nevidence offered in favor of\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n in the first instance. For this reason they both will reject\nMoore\u2019s proof as one based on an unjustified\n premise.[15]\n Moretti (2014) suggests that the dogmatist could alternatively\ncontend that Moore\u2019s proof is non-transmissive because\n\\(s\\)\u2019s experience of a hand gives \\(s\\) immediate\njustification for believing both the premise \\(\\rP_8\\) and the\nconclusion \\(\\rQ_8\\) of the proof at once. According to this\ndiagnosis, Moore\u2019s proof is epistemically flawed\nbecause it instantiates a variant of indirectness (in which\nthe evidence is an experience of a hand). Pryor\u2019s\nanalysis of Moore\u2019s proof has principally been criticized in\nconjunction with his liberalism in epistemology of perception. (See\nCohen 2002, 2005; Schiffer 2004; Wright 2007; White 2006; Siegel &\nSilins 2015.)\n\nSome authors (e.g., Wright 2003; Pryor 2004; White 2006; Silins 2007;\nNeta 2010) have investigated whether certain variants of\nMoore are transmissive of justification. These arguments start from a\npremise like\n \\(\\rP_8\\),\n describing a (supposed) perceivable state of affairs of the external\nworld, and deduce from it the logical negation of a relevant\nskeptical conjecture. Consider for example the variant of\nMoore that starts from \\(\\rP_8\\) and replaces\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n with:\n\n\\(\\rQ_8^*\\).\n It is not the case that I am a handless brain in a vat fed with\nthe hallucination of a hand held up in front of my face.\n\n\nLet\u2019s call Moore* this variant of\n Moore.\n While dogmatists \u00e0 la Pryor argue that\nMoore* is transmissive but dialectically flawed (cf. Pryor\n2004), conservatives \u00e0 la Wright contend that it is\nnon-transmissive (cf. Wright 2007). Although it remains very\ncontroversial whether or not Moore is transmissive,\nepistemologists have found some prima facie reason to think\nthat arguments like Moore* are non-transmissive.\n\nAn important difference between Moore and Moore* is\nthis: whereas the logical negation of\n \\(\\rQ_8\\)\n does not explain the evidential statement\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n (\u201cMy experience is in all respects as of a hand held up in\nfront of my face\u201d) adduced in support of\n \\(\\rP_8\\),\n the logical negation of\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\u2014\\(\\notQ_8^*\\)\u2014somewhat\n explains \\(\\rE_8\\). Since \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) provides a potential\nexplanation of \\(\\rE_8\\), is it intuitive that \\(\\rE_8\\) is\nevidence (perhaps very week) for believing \\(\\notQ_8^*\\). It\nis easy to conclude from this that \\(s\\) cannot acquire justification\nfor believing \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) via transmission through Moore*\nupon learning \\(\\rE_8\\). For it is intuitive that if this were the\ncase, \\(\\rE_8\\) should count as evidence for \\(\\rQ_8^*\\). But this is\nimpossible: one and the same proposition cannot simultaneously be\nevidence for a hypothesis and its logical negation. By formalizing\nintuitions of this type, White (2006) has put forward a simple\nBayesian argument to the effect that Moore* and similar\nvariants of Moore are not transmissive of\n justification.[16]\n (See Silins 2007 for discussion. For responses to White, see\nWeatherson 2007; Kung 2010; Moretti 2015.)\n\nFrom the above analysis it is easy to conclude that the\ninformation-dependence template is satisfied by\nMoore* and akin proofs. In fact note that if\n \\(\\rE_8\\)\n is evidence for both\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n and \\(\\notQ_8^*\\), it seems correct to say that \\(s\\) can acquire a\njustification for believing \\(\\rP_8\\) only if \\(s\\) has independent\njustification for disbelieving \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) and thus\nbelieving \\(\\rQ_8^*\\). Since \\(\\notQ_8^*\\) counts as a\nnon-perceiving hypothesis for Pryor, this gives us a reason\nto doubt dogmatism (cf. White\n 2006).[17]\n\nColiva (2012, 2015) defends a view\u2014baptized by her\nmoderatism\u2014that aims to be a middle way between\nWright\u2019s conservatism and Pryor\u2019s dogmatism. The moderate\ncontends\u2014against the conservative\u2014that cornerstones cannot\nbe justified and that to possess perceptual justification \\(s\\) needs\nno justification for accepting any cornerstones. On the other hand,\nthe moderate claims\u2014against the dogmatist\u2014that to possess\nperceptual justification \\(s\\) needs to assume (without\njustification) relevant\n cornerstones.[18]\n By relying on her variant of the information-dependent\ntemplate described in\n Sect. 3.2,\n Coliva concludes that neither Moore nor any proof like\nMoore* is transmissive. (For a critical discussion of\nmoderatism see Avnur 2017; Baghramian 2017; Millar 2017; Volpe 2017;\nColiva 2017.)\n\nEpistemological disjunctivists like McDowell and Pritchard have argued\nthat in paradigmatic cases of perceptual knowledge, what is meant to\ngive \\(s\\) justification for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is, not\n \\(\\rE_8\\),\n but \\(s\\)\u2019s factive state of seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\). This seems\nto have consequences for the question whether Moore*\ntransmits propositional justification. Pritchard explicitly defends\nthe claim that when \\(s\\) sees that \\(\\rP_8\\), thereby learning that\n\\(\\rP_8, s\\) can come to know by inference from \\(\\rP_8\\) the negation\nof any skeptical hypothesis inconsistent with \\(\\rP_8\\), like\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n (cf. Pritchard 2012a: 129\u201330). This may encourage the belief\nthat, for Pritchard, Moore* can transmit the justification\nfor \\(\\rP_8\\), based on s\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\), to\n\\(\\rQ_8^*\\) (see Lockhart 2018 for an explicit argument to this\neffect). This claim must however be handled with some care.\n\nAs we have seen in\n Sect. 2,\n Pritchard contends that when one knows \\(p\\) on the basis of evidence\n\\(e\\), one can know \\(p\\)\u2019s consequence \\(q\\) by inference from\n\\(p\\) only if \\(e\\) sufficiently supports \\(q\\). For Pritchard this\ncondition is met when \\(s\\)\u2019s support for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8, s\\)\u2019s\nepistemic situation is objectively good (i.e., \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive\nfaculties are working properly in a cooperative environment) and the\nskeptical hypothesis ruled out by\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n has not been epistemically motivated. For, in this case, \\(s\\) has a\nreflectively accessible factive support for believing\n\\(\\rP_8\\) that entails\u2014and so sufficiently\nsupports\u2014\\(\\rQ_8^*\\). Thus, in this case, nothing stands in the\nway of \\(s\\) competently deducing \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) from \\(\\rP_8\\), thereby\ncoming to know \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) on the basis of \\(\\rP_8\\).\n\nIf upon deducing one proposition from another, \\(s\\) comes to\njustifiably believe\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n for the first-time, the inference from\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n to \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) presumably transmits doxastic justification.\n(See the supplement on\n Transmission of Propositional Justification versus Transmission of Doxastic Justification.)\n It is more dubious, however, that when \\(s\\)\u2019s support for\n\\(\\rP_8\\) is constituted by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\),\nMoore* is also transmissive of propositional\njustification. For instance, one might contend that Moore* is\nnon-transmissive because it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate described in\n Sect. 3.2\n (cf. Wright 2002). To start with, \\(\\rP_8\\) entails \\(\\rQ_8^*\\), so\n (D1)\n is satisfied. Let \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) be the proposition\nthat this is no hand but \\(s\\) is victim of a hallucination of a hand\nheld up before her face. Since \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) would be\ntrue if \\(\\rQ_8^*\\) were false,\n (D4)\n is also satisfied. Furthermore, take the grounds of \\(s\\)\u2019s\njustification for \\(\\rP_8\\) to be \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\).\nSince this experience is a state for \\(s\\) indistinguishable from one\nin which \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) is true,\n (D2)\n is also satisfied. Finally, it might be argued that the proposition\nthat one is not hallucinating is a presupposition of the cognitive\nproject of learning about one\u2019s environment through perception.\nIt follows that \\(\\rR^{*}_{\\textit{Moore}}\\) is incompatible with a\npresupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of learning about\none\u2019s environment through perception. Thus\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n appears fulfilled too. So, Moore* won\u2019t transmit the\njustification that \\(s\\) has for \\(\\rP_8\\) to \\(\\rQ_8^*\\).\n\nTo resist this conclusion, a disjunctivist might insist that\nMoore*, relative to \\(s\\)\u2019s support for\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n supplied by \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\), doesn\u2019t always\ninstantiate the disjunctive template because\n (D2)\n isn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled (cf. Lockhart 2018.) By invoking a\ndistinction drawn by Pritchard (2012a), one might contend that (D2)\nisn\u2019t necessarily fulfilled because \\(s\\), though unable to\nintrospectively discriminate seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\) from hallucinating\nit, may have evidence that favors the hypothesis that she is in the\nfirst state, which makes the state reflectively accessible. For\nPritchard, this happens\u2014as we have seen\u2014when \\(s\\) sees\nthat \\(\\rP_8\\) in good epistemic conditions and the skeptical\nconjecture that \\(s\\) is having a hallucination of a hand hasn\u2019t\nbeen epistemically motivated. In this case, \\(s\\) can come to know\n \\(\\rQ_8^*\\)\n by inference from \\(\\rP_8\\) even if she is unable to introspectively\ndiscriminate one situation from the other.\n\nPritchard\u2019s thesis that, in good epistemic conditions,\n\\(s\\)\u2019s factive support for believing\n \\(\\rP_8\\)\n coinciding with \\(s\\)\u2019s seeing that \\(\\rP_8\\) is reflectively\naccessible is controversial (cf. Piazza 2016 and Lockhart 2018). Since\nthis thesis is essential to the contention that Moore* may\nnot instantiate the disjunctive template and may thus be\ntransmissive of propositional justification, the latter contention is\nalso controversial.\n\nSo far we have focused on perceptual justification. Now let\u2019s\nswitch to religious justification. Shaw (2019) aims to\nmotivate a view in religious epistemology\u2014he contends that the\n\u2018theist in the street\u2019, though unaware of the traditional\narguments for theism, can find independent rational support for\nbelieving that God exists through proofs for His existence. These\nproofs are based on religious experiences and parallel in structure\nMoore\u2019s proof of an external world interpreted as having the\npremise supported by an experience.\n\nA Moorean proof for the existence of God is one that deduces a belief\nthat God exists from what Alston (1991) calls a \u2018manifestation\nbelief\u2019 (M-belief, for short). An M-belief is a belief based\nnon-inferentially on a corresponding mystical experience. Typical\nM-beliefs are about God\u2019s acts toward a given subject at a given\ntime: for example, beliefs about God\u2019s bringing comfort to me,\nreproving me for some wrongdoing, or demonstrating His love for me,\nand so on. Here is Moorean proof for the existence of God:\n\nGod\n\n\\(\\rP_9\\).\n God is comforting me just now.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_9\\).\n God exists.\n\n\n\nNote that the \u2018good\u2019 case in which my experience that\n \\(\\rP_9\\)\n is veridical has a corresponding, subjectively indistinguishable,\n\u2018bad\u2019 case, in which it only seems to me that \\(\\rP_9\\)\nbecause I\u2019m suffering from a delusional religious experience. A\nconcern is, therefore, that God may instantiate the\ndisjunctive template. In this case, my experience as if\n\\(\\rP_9\\) could actually justify \\(\\rP_9\\) only if I had independent\njustification for\n \\(\\rQ_9\\)\n (cf. Pritchard 2012b). If so, God isn\u2019t\ntransmissive.\n\nShaw (2019) concedes that\n God\n is dialectically ineffective. To defend its transmissivity, he\nappeals to religious epistemological disjunctivism, which says that an\nM-belief that \\(p\\) can enjoy infallible rational support in virtue of\none\u2019s pneuming that \\(p\\), where this mental state is\nboth factive and accessible on reflection. Shaw intends\n\u2018pneuming that \\(p\\)\u2019 to stand as a kind of\nreligious-perceptual analogue to \u2018seeing that \\(p\\)\u2019 (cf.\nShaw 2016, 2019). When it comes to God, my belief that\n\\(\\rP_9\\) is supposed to be justified by my pneuming that God is\ncomforting me just now. As we have seen in the case of\nMoore*, a worry is that conceiving of the justification for\n\\(\\rP_9\\) along epistemological disjunctivist lines may not suffice to\nexempt God from the charge of instantiating the\ndisjunctive template and being thus non-transmissive.\n4.2 McKinsey\u2019s Paradox\n\nMcKinsey (1991, 2002, 2003, 2007) has offered a reductio argument for\nthe incompatibility of first-person privileged access to mental\ncontent and externalism about mental content. The privileged access\nthesis roughly says that it is necessarily true that if \\(s\\) is\nthinking that \\(x\\), then \\(s\\) can in principle know a\npriori (or in a non-empirical way) that she is thinking that\n\\(x\\). Externalism about mental content roughly says that predicates\nof the form \u2018is thinking that \\(x\\)\u2019\u2014e.g., \u2018is\nthinking that water is wet\u2019\u2014express properties that are\nwide, in the sense that possession of these properties by\n\\(s\\) logically or conceptually implies the existence of relevant\ncontingent objects external to \\(s\\)\u2019s mind\u2014e.g., water.\nMcKinsey argues that \\(s\\) may reason along these lines:\n\nWater\n\n\\(\\rP_{10}\\).\n I am thinking that water is wet.\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\).\n If I am thinking that water is wet, then I have (or my linguistic\ncommunity has) been embedded in an environment that contains\nwater.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n I have (or my linguistic community has) been embedded in an\nenvironment that contains water.\n\n\n\nWater produces an absurdity. If the privileged access thesis\nis true, \\(s\\) knows\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\nnon-empirically. If semantic externalism is true, \\(s\\)\nknows\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\na priori by conceptual analysis. Since \\(\\rP_{10}\\) and\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) do entail\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\n and knowledge is presumably closed under known entailment, \\(s\\)\nknows \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\u2014which is an empirical\nproposition\u2014by simply competently deducing it from \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\nand \\(\\rP_{11}\\) and without conducting any empirical\ninvestigation. Since this is absurd, McKinsey concludes that the\nprivileged access thesis or semantic externalism must be false.\n\nOne way to resist McKinsey\u2019s incompatibilist conclusion\nthat the privileged access thesis and externalism about mental content\ncannot be true together is to argue that\n Water\n is non-transmissive. Since knowledge is presumably closed under known\nentailment, it remains true that \\(s\\) cannot know\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n and\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n while failing to know\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n However, McKinsey\u2019s paradox originates from the stronger\nconclusion\u2014motivated by the claim that Water is a\ndeductively valid argument featuring premises knowable\nnon-empirically\u2014that \\(s\\), by running Water, could\nknow non-empirically the empirical proposition\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\) that she or members of her community have had contact\nwith water. This is precisely what could not happen if Water\nis non-transmissive: in this case \\(s\\) couldn\u2019t learn\n\\(\\rQ_{10}\\) on the basis of her non-empirical justification for\n\\(\\rP_{10}\\) and \\(\\rP_{11}\\), and her knowledge of the entailment\nbetween \\(\\rP_{10}\\), \\(\\rP_{11}\\), and \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) (see mainly\nWright 2000, 2003,\n 2011).[19]\n\nA first possibility to defend the thesis that Water is\nnon-transmissive is to argue that it instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate (considered in\n Sect. 3.2)\n (cf. Wright 2000, 2003, 2011). If Water is non-transmissive,\n\\(s\\) could acquire a justification for, or knowledge of,\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n and\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n only if \\(s\\) had an independent justification for, or\nknowledge of,\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\).\n (And to avoid the absurd result that McKinsey recoils from, this\nindependent justification should be empirical.) If this diagnosis is\ncorrect, one need not deny \\(\\rP_{10}\\) or \\(\\rP_{11}\\) to reject the\nintuitively false claim that \\(s\\) could know the empirical\nproposition \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) in virtue of only non-empirical\nknowledge.\n\nTo substantiate the thesis that Water instantiates the\ndisjunctive template one should first emphasize that the kind\nof externalism about mental content underlying \\(\\rP_{10}\\) is\ncompatible with the possibility that \\(s\\) suffers from illusion of\ncontent. Were this to happen with \\(\\rP_{10}, s\\) would seem to\nintrospect that she believes that water is wet whereas there is\nnothing like that content to be believed by \\(s\\) in the first\ninstance. Consider:\n\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\).\n \u2018water\u2019 refers to no natural kind so that\nthere is no content expressed by the sentence \u2018water is\nwet\u2019.\n\n\n\\(s\\)\u2019s state of having introspective justification for\nbelieving\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n is arguably subjectively indistinguishable from a situation in which\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) is true. Thus condition\n (D2)\n of the disjunctive template is met. Moreover,\n\\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) appears incompatible with an obvious\npresupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for believing \\(\\rP_{10}\\), at least if\nthe content that water is wet embedded in \\(\\rP_{10}\\) is constrained\nby \\(s\\) or her linguistic community having being in contact with\nwater. Thus condition\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n is also met. Furthermore, \\(\\rP_{10}\\) entails \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) (when\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) is in background information). Hence, condition\n (D1)\n is fulfilled. If one could also show that\n (D4)\n is satisfied in Water, in the sense that if \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\nwere false \\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\) would be true, one would have\nshown that the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater. Wright (2000) takes (D4) to be fulfilled and concludes\nthat the disjunctive template is satisfied by\nWater.\n\nUnfortunately, the claim that\n (D4)\n is satisfied in Water cannot easily be vindicated (cf.\nWright 2003). Condition (D4) is satisfied in Water only if it\nis true that if \\(s\\) (or \\(s\\)\u2019s linguistic community) had not\nbeen embedded in an environment that contains water, the term\n\u2018water\u2019 would have referred to no natural kind. This is\ntrue only if the closest possible world \\(w\\) in which this\ncounterfactual\u2019s antecedent is true is like Boghossian\u2019s\n(1997) Dry Earth\u2014namely, a world where no one has ever\nhad any contact with any kind of watery stuff, and all apparent\ncontacts with it are always due to multi-sensory hallucination. If\n\\(w\\) is not Dry Earth, but Putnam\u2019s Twin\nEarth, however, the counterfactual turns out false, as in this\npossible world people usually have contact with some other watery\nstuff that they call \u2018water\u2019. So, in this world\n\u2018water\u2019 refers to a natural kind, though not to\nH2O. Since determining which of Dry Earth or\nTwin Earth is modally closer to the actual world (supposing\n\\(s\\) is in the actual world)\u2014and so determining whether (D4) is\nsatisfied in Water\u2014is a potentially elusive task, the\nclaim that Water instantiates the disjunctive\ntemplate appears less than fully\n warranted.[20]\n\nAn alternative dissolution of McKinsey paradox\u2014also based on a\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity\u2014seems to be available if one\nconsiders the proposition that \n\n\\(\\rQ_{11}\\).\n \\(s\\) (or \\(s\\)\u2019s linguistic community) has been embedded\nin an environment containing some watery substance (cf.\nWright 2003 and 2011).\n\n\nThis alternative strategy assumes that\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\),\n rather than\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\),\n is a presupposition of \\(s\\)\u2019s cognitive project of attaining\nintrospective justification for\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\).\n\nEven if Water doesn\u2019t instantiate the disjunctive\ntemplate, a new diagnosis of what\u2019s wrong with\nMcKinsey\u2019s paradox could rest on the claim that the different\nargument yielded by expanding Water with\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\n as conclusion\u2014call it Water*\u2014instantiates the\ndisjunctive template. If\n \\(\\rR_{\\textit{water}}\\)\n is the same proposition as above, it is easy to see that\nWater* satisfies conditions\n (D4),\n (D2), and\n (D3\\(^{*}\\))\n of the disjunctive template. Furthermore\n (D1)\n is satisfied at least in the sense that it seems a priori\nthat\n \\(\\rP_{10}\\)\n via\n \\(\\rQ_{10}\\)\n entails\n \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\n (if\n \\(\\rP_{11}\\)\n is in background information) (cf. Wright 2011). On this novel\ndiagnosis of non-transmissivity, what would be paradoxical is that\n\\(s\\) could earn justification for \\(\\rQ_{11}\\) in virtue of her\nnon-empirical justification for \\(\\rP_{10}\\) and \\(\\rP_{11}\\) and her\nknowledge of the a priori link from \\(\\rP_{10}\\),\n\\(\\rP_{11}\\) via \\(\\rQ_{10}\\) to \\(\\rQ_{11}\\). If one follows\nWright\u2019s (2003)\n suggestion[21]\n that \\(s\\) is entitled to accept \\(\\rQ_{11}\\)\u2014namely,\nthe presupposition that there is a watery substance that provides\n\u2018water\u2019 with its extension\u2014Water becomes\ninnocuously transmissive, and the apparent paradox\nsurrounding Water vanishes. This is so at least if one grants\nthat it is a priori that water is the watery stuff of our\nactual acquaintance, once it is presupposed that there is any watery\nstuff of our actual acquaintance. For useful criticism of responses of\nthis type to McKinsey\u2019s paradox see Sainsbury (2000), Pritchard\n(2002), Brown (2003, 2004), McLaughlin (2003), McKinsey (2003), and\nKallestrup (2011).\n",
