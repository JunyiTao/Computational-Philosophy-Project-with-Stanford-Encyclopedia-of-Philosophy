When we refer to the \u201cdefinite classically described\nstate\u201d of, say, a cat, it means that the position and the state\n(alive, dead, smiling, etc.) of the cat is specified according to our\nability to distinguish between the alternatives, and that this\nspecification corresponds to a classical picture, e.g., no\nsuperpositions of dead and alive cats are allowed in a single\nworld.\n\nAnother concept, which is closer to Everett\u2019s original proposal,\nsee Saunders 1995, is that of a relative, or perspectival world\ndefined for every physical system and every one of its states:\nfollowing Lewis 1986 we call it a centered world. This\nconcept is useful when a world is centered on a perceptual state of a\nsentient being. In this world, all objects which the sentient being\nperceives have definite states, but objects that are not under\nobservation might be in a superposition of different (classical)\nstates. The advantage of a centered world is that a quantum phenomenon\nin a distant galaxy does not split it, while the advantage of the\ndefinition presented here is that we can consider a world without\nspecifying a center; our usual language is just as useful for\ndescribing worlds that existed at times when there were no sentient\nbeings.\n\nThe concept of a world in the MWI is based on the layman\u2019s\nconception of a world; however, several features are different.\nObviously, the definition of the world as everything that\nexists does not hold in the MWI. \u201cEverything that\nexists\u201d is the Universe, and there is only one Universe. The\nUniverse incorporates many worlds similar to the one the layman is\nfamiliar with. A layman believes that our present world has a unique\npast and future. According to the MWI, a world defined at some moment\nof time corresponds to a unique world at a time in the past, but to a\nmultitude of worlds at a time in the future.\n",
