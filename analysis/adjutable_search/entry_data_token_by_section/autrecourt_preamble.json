    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe most striking feature of Autrecourt\u2019s academic career is his\ncondemnation in 1347. In almost every history of medieval philosophy,\nhis censure is presented as one of the most important events in\nfourteenth-century Paris. In the older literature, Autrecourt\u2019s\nviews have become linked to allegedly skeptical tendencies in\nscholastic thought, and have been unduly shadowed by assumptions about\ntheir relation to the views of William of Ockham. Over the last two\ndecades, however, it has become apparent that the study of\nAutrecourt\u2019s thought has been wrongly placed in the larger\ncontext of the battle against Ockhamism at the University of Paris in\nthe years 1339\u20131347. Although Autrecourt was no skeptic \u2014 on the\ncontrary, he attacked the \u201cAcademics\u201d or ancient Skeptics\n\u2014 his philosophical stance challenges the prevailing\nAristotelian tradition. In particular, Autrecourt rejected some of the\nmain tenets of scholastic metaphysics and epistemology, such as the\nsubstance-accident structure of reality and the principle of\ncausality.\n",
