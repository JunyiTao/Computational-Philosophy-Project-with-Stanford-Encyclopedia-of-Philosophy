    "preamble": "\n\nCount Hans Ludwig Paul Yorck von Wartenburg (1835\u20131897) was a\nGerman philosopher. He is primarily known for his long collaboration\nwith his friend Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911) and for his impact\non Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1900\u20132002). Together with Dilthey, Yorck was the first\nphilosopher to elaborate the specific concept of historicity\n[Geschichtlichkeit] as a defining characteristic in the\nontology of human beings. In particular, Yorck emphasized\nthe generic difference between the ontic and the historical,\ni.e., the difference between what is seen or conceptualized (or\naesthetically contemplated) as permanent nature, or essence, or idea,\nand the felt historical rhythm of life, i.e., life\u2019s immersion\nin and belonging to the overarching and always changing waves of\nhistory. In contradistinction to Dilthey\u2019s epistemological\nendeavors to clarify the foundations of the historical sciences\nvis-\u00e0-vis the natural sciences, Yorck aimed exclusively at the\nontology of historical life, particularly the historical band\n(syndesmos) and effective connection (virtuality)\nthat unites generational life. Based on the primacy of historical\nlife, Yorck adopted a decidedly anti-metaphysical stance, rejecting\nall claims of knowledge sub specie aeternitatis. He combined\nthis with a Christian, particularly Lutheran, conception of a\nhistorical and personal but entirely transcendent God, relative to\nwhom each individual person, in inescapable singularity, defines his\nor her own life story. Yorck\u2019s ideas were first made public in\nthe form of a posthumous volume of his Correspondence with\nDilthey in 1923 (Yorck 1923). Through this publication he influenced\nnot only Heidegger (see Farin 2016, Fagniez 2013, Dastur 2011, Ruin\n1994) and Gadamer (1990), but also Misch, Rothacker, Scholem,\nBultmann, Marcuse, and others. Between 1956 and 1970 various\nunfinished fragments of Yorck\u2019s writings were published (see\n Bibliography).\n They contain the outline of Yorck\u2019s systematic psychology of\nhistory and history of philosophy, as well as extensive reflections on\nthe partial negation or suppression of temporality in thought and\nmetaphysics (due to the inherently spatial character of representation\nand thought as such). These later works have not received as much\nattention as his earlier views in his Correspondence with\nDilthey.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Yorck\u2019s Life\n\nCount Paul Yorck von Wartenburg was born in Berlin on March 1, 1835.\nHis grandfather was the famous Field Marshal Hans David Ludwig Yorck\nvon Wartenburg. (The Field Marshal\u2019s courageous signing of the\nConvention of Tauroggen, originally unauthorized by the king and thus\nin effect treasonous, started the Prussian War of Liberation against\nNapoleon in 1813. It made the Field Marshal Yorck a national hero.)\nPaul Yorck\u2019s father, Ludwig David Yorck von Wartenburg, managed\nthe family\u2019s estate at Klein-Oels in Silesia (near Breslau,\ntoday Wrok\u0142aw) where Paul Yorck grew up. Paul Yorck\u2019s\nparents were well-connected to a number of literary, philosophical,\nand artistic circles in Berlin and elsewhere. They were acquainted\nwith Friedrich Schleiermacher, Ludwig Tieck, Bettina von Arnim,\nAlexander von Humboldt, Karl August Varnhagen, Johann Gustav Droysen,\nKarl Friedrich Schinkel, and Ernst von Wildenbruch, to name but a few.\nThe family Yorck von Wartenburg belonged to the dominant elite in\nPrussia and the German Empire. Yorck\u2019s life-long enthusiasm for\nhistory and historical reality must be seen against this biographical\nbackground.\n\nIn 1855 Paul Yorck began his university studies in law at Bonn, but\nsoon moved to the university at Breslau where he also enrolled in\nphilosophy courses. After passing the second law exam, Yorck published\nhis exam essay \u201cThe Catharsis of Aristotle and Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus of Colonus\u201d (Yorck 1866), the only publication by him\nduring his lifetime. When his father passed away in 1865 Yorck took\nover the management of the family estate at Klein-Oels. He also\nassumed his father\u2019s hereditary seat in the Prussian Upper\nChamber [Herrenhaus] where he participated in political\ndebates. He took part in the Franco-Prussian war (1870\u20131871);\nand he was present at the Proclamation of the German Empire in the\nHall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles in 1871.\n\nIn the same year Yorck met Dilthey, who had been called to the\nUniversity at Breslau. They quickly became friends and Dilthey was a\nfrequent guest at Klein-Oels, often staying for prolonged working\nholidays. The posthumously published Dilthey\u2013Yorck\nCorrespondence (Yorck 1923) is an impressive testimony to\nthis friendship.\n\nFrom the early 1890s Yorck worked on a manuscript on Heraclitus (Yorck\n1896/97) and a book about the Stances of Consciousness and\nHistory (Yorck\n 1892\u20131897).[1]\n Before his death, Yorck declared the two works unfinished and not\nready for publication. Published only posthumously, they are, in the\nwords of Karlfried Gr\u00fcnder (1970, 55), \u201csketches\u201d of\nfirst drafts for \u201cgreat philosophical books.\u201d Paul Yorck\ndied at Klein-Oels, September 12, 1897. His grandson, Count Peter\nYorck, who had studied Yorck\u2019s unfinished works, was a leading\nmember of the Kreisauer Circle, the German resistance cell responsible\nfor the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944.\n2. Correspondence with Dilthey\n\nWhen in 1923 the Correspondence between Yorck and Dilthey\n(Yorck 1923) (abbreviated hereafter as CR) was published as \u201ca\nmemorial\u201d to their philosophical friendship (CR, VI), it\nestablished Yorck not only as an equal to Dilthey and a faithful\ninterlocutor and eager co-worker on Dilthey\u2019s\n project(s),[2]\n but also as a philosopher and keen observer of his times in his own\nright.\n\nIn 1892 Yorck writes to Dilthey:\n\n\nOur time portends something of an end of an epoch. A token of this is\nthe disappearance of the elemental pleasure in historical realities.\nThe feeling that everything passes [Gef\u00fchl der\nVerg\u00e4nglichkeit] haunts the world once again. (CR, p.\n140)\n\n\nDilthey clearly shares this sentiment. In a more extensive note about\nthe same topic Yorck writes:\n\n\nIt is my growing conviction that today we stand at a historical\nturning point similar to the one of the 15th century. In\ncontradistinction to the scientific-technological progress, which\nconsists in increased abstraction and isolation, a new formation comes\ninto being because the human being in his entirety [der ganze\nMensch] once again takes a stand and faces the problems of life.\nEvery time it is a new stance towards life [Lebensstellung]\nand a new conception of it that ushers in a new epoch, not any old\ndiscovery or invention, even if it is of the greatest import. The\nthread on which science hangs has become so long and spun ever so\nthin, that now it is snapping in the face of the impetuous question:\nWhat is truth? (CR, p. 128)\n\n\nIn yet another letter, Yorck claims that, since the Renaissance,\nscience and knowledge\u2014abstracted from feeling and\nvolition\u2014have followed an eccentric trajectory, in which they\nhave lost sight of man, resulting in profound self-alienation:\n\n\nThe ripple effects caused by the eccentric principle, which ushered in\na new age more than four hundred years ago, seem to me to have become\nexceedingly broad and flat; knowledge has advanced to the point of\nnullifying itself, and man has become so far removed from himself that\nhe no longer catches sight of himself. \u2018Modern\u2019 man, that\nis, man since the Renaissance, is fit for the grave. (CR, p. 83)\n\n\nThe general thrust of these reflections and the language used are\nreminiscent of Nietzsche\u2019s descriptions of the \u201cuncanniest\nof all guests,\u201d nihilism. In fact, it is the usually so cautious\nDilthey who, in one of his last letters to Yorck, remarks that the\ntrue but \u201chorrible word about the age has been announced\u201d\nby no one other than Nietzsche (CR, p. 238). There is no reason to\nbelieve that Yorck would have disagreed.\n\nYorck\u2019s and Dilthey\u2019s awareness of an epochal shift,\nwritten some twenty years before World War I, could not fail to\nimpress the generation of students who, in the aftermath of this\nEuropean catastrophe, their predicament exacerbated by continued\neconomic hardship and hyperinflation, returned to studying philosophy\nin the early 1920s. This may explain why, much later, in the 1980s,\nGadamer would still speak of the enormous significance of the\npublication of the Dilthey\u2013Yorck correspondence in 1923, calling\nit an \u201cepoch-making moment\u201d in its own right (Gadamer\n1995, p. 8).\n\nAccording to Yorck, the analysis and evaluation of the contemporary\nintellectual-historical situation is integral to philosophy\u2014all\nthe more so if philosophy self-reflexively grasps its ineluctably\nhistorical nature, which in itself is one of Yorck\u2019s main\nphilosophical interests. The basic idea for the historicity of\nphilosophy is fairly straightforward. For Yorck, as for Dilthey,\nphilosophy is \u201ca manifestation of life\u201d\n[Lebensmanifestation] (CR, p. 250), a product or an\nexpression in which life articulates itself in a certain way. But all\nlife is intrinsically historical. Life is inconceivable without its\nhistorical development. Yorck writes:\n\n\nThe entire given psycho-physical reality is not something that\nis, but something that lives: that is the germ cell of\nhistoricity. And self-reflection, which is directed not at an abstract\nI, but the entirety of my own self, will find that I am historically\ndetermined, just as physics grasps me as determined by the cosmos.\nJust as I am nature, I am history. And in this decisive sense we have\nto understand Goethe\u2019s dictum of [our] having lived\n[Gelebthaben] for at least three thousand years. Conversely,\nit follows that history as a scientific discipline exists only as\npsychology of history. (CR 71/72)\n\n\nFor Yorck, as for Dilthey, human life is incorrectly understood if it\nis subsumed under the generic catch-all category of\n\u201cexistence.\u201d The first point is that human life is\ninconceivable without temporal and historical development, movement,\nand change; life always transcends itself, hence it never simply\n\u201cis.\u201d The mode of being for humans is \u201clife,\u201d\nnot\n \u201cexistence.\u201d[3]\n And life, unlike existence, is intrinsically historical. Precisely\nthis distinction is brought home by Yorck\u2019s demand to always\nobserve \u201cthe generic difference between the ontic and the\nhistorical\u201d (CR, p. 191). The ontic is what is simply\n\u201cthere\u201d without inner life, temporality, or history. It\nincludes the physical entities in the world, as well as abstract\nobjects, numbers, essences, ideas, etc. The \u201contic\u201d is\ntoto caelo other than \u201cthe historical.\u201d\nYorck\u2019s second point is that all history is a development of\nhuman powers or human psychology, where psychology does not\nmean some inert or fixed \u201cnature,\u201d but the constant play\nof forces, the ever shifting configurations between understanding,\naffectivity, and volition. (See\n Section 3.1\n below.)\n\nIn addition, Yorck emphasizes the \u201cvirtuality\u201d or\n\u201ceffectivity\u201d of history, i.e., the cumulative effects and\nresults of individual persons exerting power and influence in\ntransmitting the possibility and conception of life to their\ndescendants. Successor-generations develop their own stance towards\nlife in response to what they have inherited from the individuals and\ngenerations preceding them. History is the ongoing transmission of\nlife\u2019s potentiality, including the transmission of power, ideas,\nand material conditions.\n\n\nThe child gains through the mother\u2019s sacrifice, her sacrifice\nbenefits the child. Without such virtual transmission of power\n[Kraft\u00fcbertragung] there is no history at all. (CR, p.\n155)\n\n\nYorck does not refer to some anonymous bio-power or power structures,\nas discussed in contemporary philosophy, but to the authority,\nsacrifice, and direct action and communication through which an\nindividual person or groups of persons form and shape the lives and\nbehaviours of coming generations. It is for this reason that Yorck\ninsists that \u201cperson\u201d is the key historical category (CR,\np. 109). History is the history of historical, individual agents,\nprojecting their power and authority into the future.\n\nSince Yorck understands history as a connecting band of ideas and\nconditions passed on from one person to another, and indeed from one\ngeneration to another, his position must not be associated with\nhistoricism. For Yorck, there is one continuous and common line of\nhistorical life\u2014a living syndesmos. Past generations\nand past persons are not \u201coutside\u201d a present horizon in a\npast world of their own. Rather, they live on, as it were, in their\ndescendents. Moreover, because of this connecting band, one can go\n\u201cbackwards\u201d by way of what Yorck calls\n\u201ctransposition\u201d (CR, p. 61), transposing oneself into the\nlives of others and thus \u201cre-enacting,\u201d as Dilthey would\nsay, the positions towards life that have been lived by one\u2019s\npredecessors. That life is historical means that each person is always\nalready outside his or her own individual \u201cnature\u201d and\nplaced within the historical connection to predecessor- and\nsuccessor-generations. For Yorck, living self-consciousness is, to use\nHegel\u2019s fortuitous phrase, \u201cthe I that is\nwe and the we that is I\u201d (Hegel 1807,\np. 140).\n\nConsequently, Yorck rejects from the start the transcendental method\nin philosophy as insufficient for grasping lived historical reality.\nTranscendental philosophy reduces historical life to the merely\n\u201csubjective,\u201d which misses the genuine characteristic of\nGeist, spirit or mind, namely its real, historical extension\nand connection. As Yorck puts it, \u201cthe transcendental\nmethod\u201d merely suspends or sublates \u201cthe realm of the\nobjective,\u201d but it fails to \u201cextend the region of\nGeist\u201d (CR, p. 194). Insisting that \u201cthe\ncharacter of subjectivity does not even reach the realm of\nGeist\u201d (CR, p. 194), Yorck clearly implies that the\n\u201crealm of history\u201d is the proper domain for\nGeist. It follows that, despite his criticism of the narrow\nconfines of transcendental and/or subject-centred philosophy,\nYorck\u2019s philosophical conception of history is still inscribed\nwithin the confines of Geist-philosophy. Following Hegel, who\nargues that everything hinges on the understanding that\n\u201csubstance is subject\u201d (Hegel 1807, p. 19), Yorck agrees\nthat everything hinges on the understanding that \u201csubstance is\nhistory\u201d or \u201csubstance is historical\n spirit.\u201d[4]\n\nYorck\u2019s primary category of historical life does not only\nchallenge transcendental philosophy as too-narrow a foothold for\nphilosophy. A fortiori, it also challenges the entire\nmetaphysical tradition, which presupposes or searches for an ultimate\nobjective reality (being, idea, substance, and so on), divorced from\nthe ground of the always shifting historical life. Yorck rejects\nclaims to \u201cknowledge\u201d sub specie aeternitatis.\nFor Yorck, metaphysics is a flight from the historical reality\n\u2018on the ground.\u2019 By making historical life primary, Yorck\neffectively aims to dismantle the predominance of Greek metaphysics,\nincluding the modes of thought of modern science derived from it.\n\nBut Yorck is not content with just opposing metaphysics and\ntranscendental philosophy. Instead, he attempts to instill and to\ncultivate historical awareness in philosophy itself, based on the\nprinciple that all productions of life are as historical as life\nitself. He writes: Since \u201cto philosophize is to live,\u201d\n\u201cthere is no real philosophizing which would not be\nhistorical\u201d (CR, p. 251). More radical than Dilthey, Yorck calls\nfor the \u201chistoricization\u201d [Vergeschichtlichung]\nof philosophy:\n\n\nJust as physiology cannot abstract from physics, so\nphilosophy\u2014especially if it is critical\u2014cannot abstract\nfrom historicity [Geschichtlichkeit]. After all, the\nuncritical Critique of Kant\u2019s can be understood\nhistorically only, and thus be overcome. [Human] behaviour and\nhistoricity are like breathing and air pressure\u2014and\u2014this\nmay sound somewhat paradoxical\u2014the failure to historicize\nphilosophizing appears to me, in methodological respects, a\nmetaphysical remnant. (CR, 69)\n\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that, unlike Dilthey, Yorck\nspecifically appreciates the emphasis on historicity\n [Geschichtlichkeit][5]\n in Hegel and some of his followers, despite his rejection of\nHegel\u2019s speculative or ontical superstructure (CR,\n 59).[6]\n\nIn light of the historical nature of philosophy, Yorck draws two\ndecisive methodological inferences. First, he rejects as too rigid and\nuntenable the opposition between theoretical or systematic philosophy\nand the history of ideas (CR, p. 251), because, as an ongoing\nhistorical development, philosophy always requires both a genetic and\nhistorical clarification, as well as a systematic and theoretical\naccount. Instead of a mutually exclusive relation, Yorck sees a\nmutually productive combination. Second, because Yorck always includes\nthe present situation within the domain of history, he calls for a\n\u201ccritical,\u201d and not \u201cantiquarian,\u201d or\nquietistic mode of philosophizing (CR, p. 19). Speaking for Dilthey\nand himself, Yorck argues that this critical work of philosophy lays\nthe groundwork for the practical intent or the historical vocation of\nphilosophy:\n\n\nThe potential for practical application is of course the real\njustification for any science. Yet mathematical praxis is not\nthe only kind. In practical terms, our standpoint is pedagogical in\nintent, in the broadest and deepest sense of the word. It is the soul\nof all true philosophy and the truth of Plato and Aristotle. (CR, pp.\n42/ 43)\n\n\nIn the condensed and all too general format of the\nCorrespondence with Dilthey, Yorck develops the practical\n\u201capplication\u201d of philosophy in only the most fragmentary\nfashion. Its most important part is the actual clarification of the\ncontemporary situation, the determination of the given historical\npossibilities, and the avenues for implementing some of them. Yorck\nholds that since the Renaissance and through the works of such\nthinkers as Galileo, Descartes, and Hobbes, the self-interpretation of\nlife has found its centre of gravity in the cultivation of the\ntheoretical understanding [Verstand]. The primacy accorded to\ntheoretical understanding and what it projects as objective,\nunchangeable, and ultimate reality (metaphysical & physical) has\nushered in \u201cthe natural sciences,\u201d\n\u201cnominalism,\u201d \u201crationalism,\u201d and\n\u201cmechanism,\u201d (CR, pp. 68, 63 & 155). But this has come\nat the exclusion of the full thematization, expression, and\nappreciation of human affectivity [Gef\u00fchl], including\nthe underlying feeling of human connectivity through a shared life in\nhistory. Blocked-out are questions which affect the temporal,\nhistorical and personal existence of human beings, or what Yorck once\ncalls \u201cexistential questions\u201d [Existenzialfragen]\n(CR, p. 62), which relate to the life-goals human beings strive after,\nthe recognition of dependency, and the awareness of human mortality,\nfinitude, and death (CR, p. 120). The relative sidelining of these\naspects in the psychology of human beings lies at the bottom of\nYorck\u2019s diagnosis of the increasing self-alienation of modern\nman and the crisis of his time.\n\nWith Dilthey, Yorck attempts to highlight the \u201cfull human\nbeing\u201d [den ganzen Menschen] (CR, p. 157), as opposed\nto the rationalistically reduced, one-dimensional individual that has\npreoccupied modern philosophy and shaped modern culture. The\nhistoricization of philosophy belongs to this project, as does the\nacknowledgment of transcendence. According to Yorck, transcendence\n(CR, pp. 120, 144) facilitates the withdrawal from the world in its\nobjective reality (as represented by thought and metaphysics). It lets\nhuman life pivot around the personal, historical, and affective\ndimension, foregrounding personal responsibility and accountability to\nthe transcendent God. Against the theoretical-metaphysical stance\ndirected at an ever present objective reality, Yorck insists on the\nprimacy of the personal, historical relation to the transcendent God.\nYorck\u2019s dictum \u201cTranscendence contra metaphysics!\u201d\nexpresses not only a very strong leitmotif in his philosophical\nthought (CR, p. 42); it is actually the very\n capstone.[7]\n For this reason, Yorck has been interpreted as a religious\nexistentialist (Kaufmann, 1928). This sets him apart from Dilthey.\nYorck\u2019s conception of Christianity is heavily biased in favour\nof Luther\u2019s theology. According to Yorck, Luther\u2019s\nanti-metaphysical, historical stance towards transcendence remains a\nhistorical task for the future development of philosophy (CR, pp. 144\n& 145).\n\nSince Yorck frequently and conspicuously uses the term\nBodenlosigkeit [groundlessness], or bodenloses\nDenken [groundless thought] to describe the one-sided\nintellectualism of the scientific-technological civilization since the\nRenaissance (CR, pp. 39, 103, 250, 230, 143), questions have been\nraised about Yorck\u2019s preference for autochthony\n[Bodenst\u00e4ndigkeit] and the political implications\n thereof.[8]\n3. Philosophical Fragments on History and Psychology\n\nMore than half a century after his death, three philosophical\nfragments by Yorck\u2014originally written in the last six years of\nhis life\u2014were published between 1956 and 1970 (see the\n Bibliography).\n The most important is entitled Bewusstseinsstellung und\nGeschichte [\u201cStances of Consciousness and History\u201d]\n(abbreviated hereafter as ST). It addresses the sources and the\ndevelopment of human history, providing the philosophical underpinning\nand more detailed exploration of views that Yorck had mentioned in his\nCorrespondence with Dilthey. The following section presents\nthe major points of this systematic fragment.\n\nYorck\u2019s main aim is to provide an analysis of the underlying\npsychology of human life, which he considers the basis for all\nhistorical development. According to Yorck, particular configurations\nin the psychology of man, or stances of consciousness, determine the\ndominant shape of historical epochs. In other words, certain positions\nadopted on the level of \u201cprimary life\u201d [prim\u00e4re\nLebendigkeit], the stances taken by consciousness within life,\ndetermine \u201chistorical life\u201d [historische\nLebendigkeit] at large and can define entire epochs (ST, p. 5;\nalso pp. 52, 53). Therefore, Yorck speaks of the \u201cpsychology of\nhistory\u201d and, the \u201cphilosophic history of\nphilosophy\u201d (which traces the stances of consciousness through\nempirical history) (ST, p. 10).\n\nAll this is predicated on the supposition of our intuitive access to\npsychological or primary life through \u201cself-reflection\u201d\n[Selbstbesinnung]. Yorck interprets Dilthey\u2019s insight\nthat one cannot go beyond life to mean that one cannot surpass or\ntranscend \u201cthe empirical givenness of self-consciousness,\u201d\nwhich entails that philosophy is \u201cempirical,\u201d not\nspeculative (ST, pp. 8, 3). Evidence can only be found in\nself-consciousness. What does not pass the test in one\u2019s own\nlife cannot count as a valid expression of life: The seat of all\nnecessary truth is \u201cself-experimentation\u201d (ST, 9, also\n 54).[9]\n\nNot unlike Husserl, Yorck pursues, albeit without an elaborate set of\nmethodological rules, a \u201cre-duction\u201d of all objectivity to\nself-consciousness, where self-consciousness is a living and\nhistorical structure that cannot be restricted to knowing or any other\nparticular function of life. As Gadamer (1990, pp. 246\u2013269) has\npointed out, despite his critique of transcendental philosophy, Yorck\nmay be read as actually expanding the transcendental focus, which\ntraditionally used to be on knowing, so as to include the entire gamut\nof human experiences and their necessary conditions in human\nlife. Following Dilthey, Yorck sees human consciousness as a\nliving structure where the emphasis lies on its\n\u201caliveness,\u201d Lebendigkeit, which includes not\nonly outward-directed intentionality towards objectivity\n(representation and volition), but also self-awareness, and\nself-feeling of inner life. Close to Schleiermacher, Yorck even\nspecifies that \u201cthe ultimate datum\u201d in self-consciousness\nis \u201cthe feeling of life\u201d [Lebensgef\u00fchl]\nitself (ST, p. 11).\n3.1 Psychology of Life\n\nAccording to Yorck, life is divided and articulated in itself, namely\nas an ongoing process of self-differentiation relative to others and\nthe environment. Yorck writes:\n\n\nThe primary and exclusive datum is self-consciousness, which, although\ndivided [dirimiert] into self and other, soul and lived body\n[Leib], I and world, inner and outer, is nonetheless,\npolarity [Gegens\u00e4tzlichkeit] and articulateness\n[Gegliedertheit] in one. But self-consciousness experiences\nitself in the play and counter-play of its constitutive factors, that\nis, as something alive [ein Lebendiges]. This aliveness is\nthe basic constitution. (ST, p. 8)\n\n\nBut there is no way that this aliveness can ever be grasped in its\npurity outside the fundamental differentiation. The antithetical\ndivision in \u201cself\u201d and \u201cother\u201d is so\nfundamental that one cannot go back behind it.\n\n\nThe separation [Trennung] of self and other, I and world,\nsoul and lived body [Leib] is such an early separation,\nindeed, the first act of life, as it were, such that these derivatives\nappear as absolute, autonomous, and self-sufficient. (ST, pp.\n11/12)\n\n\nYorck concludes: \u201cThe self is only through the other, just as\nthe other is only through the self\u201d (ST, p. 11).\n\nYet \u201clife\u201d remains the primary datum for Yorck.\nReminiscent of German Idealism, particularly Hegel and H\u00f6lderlin,\nYorck understands life as \u201cdifferentiated unity\u201d\n[differenzierte Einheitlichkeit] (ST, p. 38). Life explicates\nitself in form of an inner division and polarity. Each stance of life\nis a particular configuration of life\u2019s original division\n[Urtheil or Urtheilung] (ST, p. 25). Yorck\nwrites:\n\n\nObservation shows that primary life manifests a double diremption into\n[1] polarity [Gegens\u00e4tzlichkeit] and [2] difference\n[Verschiedenheit], such that the character of polarity\npermeates and determines the elements of the articulation. (ST, p.\n10)\n\n\nLife articulates or expresses itself differently in\nthree \u201cfunctions\u201d or \u201ccomportments\u201d\n[Verhaltungen], as life is lived in [1] \u201cfeeling\u201d\n[Empfinden] or affectivity, [2] \u201cwilling\u201d\n[Wollen], and [3] \u201ccognizing\u201d\n[Vorstellen] (ST, 32). Life is divided between the\ntwo antithetical or opposite poles of spontaneity and dependence (ST,\np. 9), which, applied to the different comportments or functions of\nlife, yields [1] the tension between motivation and spontaneity in\nvolition, [2] the opposition in cognition between objective,\nmatter-of-fact representation [Sachlichkeit] and spontaneous\nprojection of formed images [Bildlichkeit] as the object of\nknowledge, and [3] the polarity between dependence on others versus\nownness [Eigenheit] in the domain of affectivity (ST, p.\n32).\n\nYorck claims that the three psychological \u201cfunctions\u201d or\ncomportments circumscribe the fixed and unalterable \u201cnatural\nground\u201d [Naturboden], or the parameters within which\nall human history is played out (ST, p. 26). There is no history\nwithout such fixed reference points. The economy of the three\nfunctions is not fixed (unlike the functions as such), but is always\nopen to the play of shifting configurations and imbalances (ST, p. 24\n& 54). More specifically, the three functions are neither\nreducible to each other nor derivable from another source, making them\nin effect equiprimordial. However, they stand in a variable and\ninverse relationship to each other, where the relative preponderance\nof one function is offset by the relative subordination of the\nremaining ones, but at no time can any particular function be\ncancelled out altogether (ST, p. 98). This inverse relationship,\ncoupled with the internal polarity within each function, accounts for\n\u201cthe restlessness of primary life\u201d (ST, p. 32). Since life\ndoes not exist in some generality, but only as a particular\nconfiguration or alignment of its functions, the overall\n\u201ctotality\u201d of the shape of a particular life is always\ndetermined by a pre-dominant position of one of its functions (ST, p.\n55). This onesidedness, which necessarily fails to express life in its\n\u201centire\n fullness\u201d[10]\n (ST, p. 54), results in the instability of each particular shape of\nconsciousness. Each real configuration of consciousness and its\nparticular bias to one function, as well as one of the antithetical\npoles within, lends itself to a new transformation, without ever\nreaching a stable or final state. Since \u201chistorical life\u201d\nis nothing other than \u201cprimary life\u201d writ large, Yorck\nholds that this inbuilt instability and restlessness in primary life\nalso constitutes the \u201cmotor of history\u201d (ST, 33). (See\n Section 3.2\n below.)\n\nYorck holds that two functions of life, willing and cognition, are\n\u201ceccentric;\u201d they pursue objects that are projected\noutside the felt interiority of self-consciousness (ST, p. 120).\nConcerning representation or cognition, Yorck writes:\n\n\nSelf-reflection reveals representation [Vorstellen] as an act\nof exteriorization, as a projection, which therefore is primarily\nmarked by its opposition to feeling. The feature of projection,\n[i.e.,] expulsion from within [innere Entfernen], being the\ncharacteristic element of all representation, is spatialization\n[Verra\u00fcmlichung] as such. (ST, p. 70)\n\n\nSpatialization is thus necessary for representation or the work of the\nunderstanding, thought. By contrast, temporality (located in\naffectivity) is not at all necessary for cognition or\nrepresentation:\n\n\nThought can abstract from temporality. Indeed, every act of thought\ncontains [\u2026] an abstraction from [temporality], inasmuch as\nthought involves an expropriation [of inner feeling]. By contrast,\nspatiality is the precondition of all\n thought.[11]\n (ST, p. 147)\n\n\nAll thought is inherently spatial, representing objects at a distance\nin space: \u201cSpatiality is the basic character of all\nthought\u201d (ST, p. 119). According to Yorck, thought or cognition\nmay abstract from particular characters of space, such as\n\u201cdirection\u201d and \u201cplace,\u201d but it cannot do\nwithout the projective opening of spatiality as such (ST, p. 100). And\nYorck suggests that it is the inherent spatiality in all thought\nwhich, within the intellectualist tradition of the West, has rendered\n\u201cspace\u201d an unsurpassable \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nreality, or transcendental condition of reality as such (ST, p. 100).\nSince thought or cognition is an achievement of life in abstraction\nfrom temporality and feeling, space itself appears as eternal, neutral\nexteriority.\n\nYorck emphasizes that cognition of objects in space amounts to an act\nof \u201cliberation,\u201d because what has been\n\u201cplaced\u201d at a \u201cpsychological distance\u201d in the\nrealm of an eternal, and neutral objectivity has lost its power over\nthe representing subject, has no impact on the person\u2019s\naffectivity, and can no longer excite the feeling that everything\npasses away (ST, p. 74).\n\nThere is thus a positive correlation between cognition and volition.\nCognitive projection is already an attempt to gain a foothold relative\nto \u201cthe flight of impressions, appearances, and\nstrivings,\u201d and the fixation of an object in space goes hand in\nhand with the search for self-constancy and\n\u201cself-affirmation\u201d [Selbstbehauptung] (ST, p.\n66). Therefore, Yorck holds that philosophy and science, as cognitive\ncomportments in life, are rooted in the striving for self-affirmation.\nHe thus attributes an eminent ethical impetus to them.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d and \u201cautonomy\u201d are the psychological\nmotivation for philosophy and science (ST, p. 42).\n\nIn contrast to cognition and volition, which are\n\u201ceccentric\u201d and directed towards the \u201couter,\u201d\nfeeling or affectivity [Gef\u00fchl or Empfindung]\nis the awareness of inwardness or interiority. Yorck writes:\n\u201cThe essence of the inner [des Innen] is feeling\n[Empfindung]\u201d (ST, p. 71). At the limit, feeling is\nobject-less and an immersion in subjective life. As Yorck explains,\nfeelings are only secondarily attached to objects. Pain or pleasure,\nfor instance, has no \u201crepresentational content\u201d\n[Vorstellungsinhalt]. Yorck writes: When \u201cI feel, I\nstay within me\u201d (ST, 71)\u2014chez moi, bei\nmir. Feeling is only minimally projective. However, since\npolarity permeates all psychological functions, Yorck is quick to\nrecognize \u201ca relation\u201d to the other, for there is no\n\u201cinner\u201d without an\n \u201couter.\u201d[12]\n But the centre of feeling or affectivity is the sphere of one\u2019s\nown, pure interiority, not as representation, but as something felt.\nTherefore, it is the actual seat of \u201call things personal\u201d\n[alles Pers\u00f6nliche], the innermost centre of personal\nlife (ST, p. 85). It is the \u201ccentral\u201d and immediate pulse\nof life, antecedent to the objectifications by cognition and volition\n(ST, p. 14). Yorck writes: \u201cThe relation of self to feeling is\nmore immediate\u201d than the subject\u2019s relation to\nrepresentation (ST, p. 99). Since the personal is something\nfelt in the interiority of one\u2019s life, and not\nsomething thought or represented and projected outwards,\nYorck concludes that self-relation is not cognitive in the first\nplace; it is not \u201cknowledge\u201d (ST, p. 72). Therefore, Yorck\nalso finds it a misguided effort \u201cto grasp natural and\nhistorical communities by means of representation,\u201d because it\nmisses the felt personal attachment, which alone lends reality to the\nhistorical connectivity and relation (ST, p. 72). Already in the\nCorrespondence, Yorck had stated that \u201chistorical\nreality is a reality of feeling\n[Empfindungsrealit\u00e4t]\u201d (CR, p. 113).\n\nNext, Yorck also claims that \u201ctime originates in feeling\u201d\n(ST, p. 135). But as feeling is non-projective, it follows that,\noriginally, \u201ctemporality\u201d is not\n \u201cobjective\u201d[13]\n (ST, 146). Yorck distinguishes between the feeling of transitoriness,\ni.e., that everything passes away\n[Verg\u00e4nglichkeitsgef\u00fchl] (ST, p. 33), and the\nfeeling or awareness of one\u2019s own mortality\n [Sterblichkeitsgef\u00fchl][14]\n (ST, p. 90). Acquiescence into one\u2019s own mortality constitutes\nthe opposite pole to self-affirmation: \u201cself-renunciation\u201d\n[Selbsthingabe] (ST, p. 14), which is thus distinct from and\neven antithetical to the ethical impetus in philosophy and science.\nYorck argues that the inversion of volitional and cognitive projection\nin feeling and its concentration in pure, passive interiority amounts\nto a \u201creligious comportment\u201d and the feeling of dependency\n(ST, 121). To the extent that the religious concentration of life in\ninteriority is inversely related to projective representation, Yorck\nunderstands religious life in terms of its \u201cfreedom from the\nworld\u201d or Weltfreiheit (ST, p. 81 & 112).\nPsychologically, freedom from the world is the precondition for the\nconsciousness of a world-transcendent God, or the consciousness of\ntranscendence (ST, p. 105). Yorck only hints at the projection sui\ngeneris involved in transcendence. But it is a projection that\nhas no cognitive or volitional content: God is intended without\nbecoming \u201can object,\u201d and willing becomes a\n\u201cnon-willing,\u201d albeit without loss of energy (ST,\n104).\n\nDrawing on Dilthey and Schleiermacher, Yorck argues that the immediate\nand indubitable reality of life is exclusively\n\u201cguaranteed\u201d through volition and affectivity alone. Yorck\nwrites: \u201cThat which opposes me or that which I feel, I call\nreal,\u201d because I cannot doubt what resists my will or affects my\npersonal life, whereas it is always possible to doubt objects\nneutrally represented in space outside me (ST, p. 89). What is thought\nand grasped as an unchanging, stable and self-same object in the space\nof thought does not affect me or solicit a desire. For Yorck,\ncognition, in abstraction from feeling and volition, is the realm of\npure \u201cphenomenality,\u201d which is always open to doubt in\nvirtue of its being merely represented or thought (ST, p. 88). Because\n\u201cthe category of reality is a predicate of feeling and\nwilling\u201d alone (ST, p. 128), Yorck concludes that it is an\n\u201cutterly uncritical\u201d and self-contradictory undertaking to\nattempt to prove \u201cthe reality of the world\u201d by means of\nthe understanding (ST, p. 129). What Yorck writes to Dilthey in a more\ngeneral vein is also applicable to this particular problem:\n\n\nThinking moves in circles and the people appear to me like flies which\nalways bump into the window pane when they try to get out into the\nopen. Someone has got to open the window, but much work and leisure is\nrequired for\n that.[15]\n\n3.2 History of Life\n\nAccording to Yorck, the characteristics of human psychology and the\neconomy of primary life delimit the course of history, since\nhistorical life merely repeats or amplifies the primary stances of\nconsciousness. Although there is thus a natural ground for history,\nYorck is at pains to emphasize that the three psychological functions\noutline \u201cpossibilities\u201d only, without any inbuilt\nteleology or fixed equilibrium, or a relation to \u201can unchanging\nordo\u201d as a permanent backdrop for history (ST, p. 4).\nAgainst such approximations of history to nature, Yorck argues for a\nthoroughly historical conception of the historical: \u201cHistory has\nnothing of the isolation [Selbst\u00e4ndigkeit] of the\nnatural [order]\u201d (ST, p. 6), but rather, in each of its phases,\nhistory is self-reflexively involved in its own\nhistoricity\u2014\u201cas the ferment of its\naliveness\u201d\u2014and thus opens itself to the ever new\n\u201chistorical contrapposto\u201d (ST, p. 6). Nothing is\nexempt from historical change. Philosophical categories through which\nthe world is understood are historical products of life and hence\ninextricably bound up with the historicity of humankind. For instance,\nYorck explicitly claims that the category of \u201cbeing\u201d is\nitself \u201ca result of life\u201d (ST, p. 8). This liberates\nhistory from all relation to an unchanging, fixed point of reference\noutside historical\n life.[16]\n\nAlthough Yorck provides only an unfinished sketch of the empirical\ncourse of the history of life, he marks three decisive turning-points:\n(1) The breakthrough to philosophy and science on the basis of the\ndominant stance of the psychological function of representation or\ncognition, primarily in ancient Greece and India; (2) the predominance\nof willing in the Roman and Jewish stance towards the world; and (3)\nthe focal centrality of feeling and interiority in Christianity,\nparticular in the Reformation, i.e., Luther. Somewhat like Hegel,\nYorck holds that history unfolds through particular primary stances\ntowards life which then become dominant in particular historical\n peoples.[17]\n3.2.1 The Greek World\n\nAccording to Yorck, in Ancient Greece consciousness displayed a\nparticular configuration of the primacy of cognition. For the Greeks,\nthe stance of consciousness towards the world is pure looking. It is\nthrough looking that reality is understood. Affectivity (feeling) and\nvolition are not countenanced as functions that disclose the world as\n such.[18]\n Truth lies in the beholding eye alone; contemplation,\ntheoria, and intuition take centre stage.\n\n\nIt is as if the clear-sighted eye is expressed in words. On the basis\nof this condition of consciousness, the function of looking\n[Anschauung], ocularity [Okularit\u00e4t], becomes\nthe organ of all free work of the mind, particularly of philosophy.\n(ST, p. 30)\n\n\nYorck finds evidence for the prevalence of ocularity or the aesthetic\nattitude, which is centred on plasticity [Gestaltlichkeit],\nin Homer, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, among others.\n\n\nForm and content constitute the aesthetic dichotomy which governs\nGreek thought in its entirety, the result of the liberation of\nocularity from all other sensuality, the aesthetic liberation, which\nstrikes a chord in everyone who has entered the threshold of Greek\nlife. Looking is the essential comportment; hence, Gestalt or Form\n[qualifies as] ousia or\n substance.[19]\n (ST, p. 31)\n\n\nThat Greek metaphysics seeks the unchangeable and impassable is the\nresult of the relative suppression of feeling and willing latent in\nall cognition, which abstracts from desires, feelings, and temporality\n(ST, p. 42). Put differently, the structural timelessness of thought\nas such is intensified in metaphysical thought where it becomes\n\u201cabsolute\u201d (ST, p. 42). Yorck emphasizes that\n\u201cnegation of temporality\u201d marks \u201cthe decisive\nmetaphysical step\u201d (ST, p. 66). Metaphysics constitutes the\ncounter-move against the feeling of temporality (that everything\npasses away), as well as the liberation from the dependence on objects\ndesired by the will. According to Yorck, the escape from temporality\nand attachment determines the entire metaphysical tradition up to and\nincluding Hegel (because even Hegel \u201contologizes\u201d life and\nrenders it ontic) (ST, p. 83).\n3.2.2 The Roman & Jewish World\n\nThe breakthrough to a form of life predominantly lived through\nstriving and volition is, according to Yorck, characteristic of the\nJewish and Roman world. Concerning the former, Yorck writes:\n\n\nWhereas the Greek, metaphysical cast of mind abstracts from\ntemporality, temporality is the determining element [in the Hebrew\nworld], as the non-aesthetic character of the Jewish way of thought is\nalready expressed in Genesis where time takes precedence over\nspace. Yet the moment of time is here placed in some metaphysical\ndistance, is, as it were, projected into the future, the realization\nof which is the prerogative of God. Thus, the stance of consciousness\nis one of hope. The messiah, who does not fulfil the law, but, rather,\ndelivers on the promise, is hoped for. (ST, p. 20)\n\n\nThus, the feeling of time is here aligned with volition and its\nprojective exteriorization. Relative to the Greek contemplation of the\neverlasting presence of the cosmos, the intensive expectation of the\nfuture reality in the Jewish world is \u201ca-cosmic.\u201d\nComparing the Greek to the Jewish world, Yorck writes:\n\n\nHere, contemplative, eternal presence; there, intense hope for an\ninvisible futurity. Here, knowledge and science; there, coupled with a\nradical devaluation of the object of knowledge, faith as personally\ngrown postulate. Here, pleasant expansion and the fullness of existing\nobjectivity; there, formless energy directed at the reality\nanticipated. (ST, p. 22)\n\n\nThe unfinished character of Yorck\u2019s manuscript is apparent\nespecially in these passages, for there is no further exploration or\nexposition of the Jewish world (let alone anything like a\njustification for the juxtaposition of the Jewish world with the Roman\nperiod). Yorck\u2019s comments concerning the Roman world are\nlikewise very sketchy at best. Although Yorck positions the Romans as\na world-historical people of the will, he does not do much more than\nto refer to the popular notion of the \u201cimperialist drive of the\nRomans\u201d (ST, p. 30). Once, in a letter to Dilthey, Yorck\nemphasizes that the Roman pursuit of power locks life into pure\nimmanence, without temporality and transcendence: \u201cMight is\neverything,\u201d he writes (CR, p. 120). Yorck continues by\ncontending that the proverbial epithet of Rome as the \u201cEternal\nCity\u201d is by no means a mere saying. Rather, for Yorck, it\ncaptures something of the ostentatious display of Rome\u2019s\nimperial power\u2014its splendid oblivion of time. Yorck writes:\n\u201cRome does not, just as no Roman ever does,\ncomprehend\u2014death\u201d (CR, p. 120). By way of historical\ncontraposition, Yorck then describes, in the same letter, the\n\u201cmute, simple crosses\u201d scratched into the walls of the\nunderground Carcere Mamertino by imprisoned early Christians.\nYorck characterizes these crosses as \u201clight-points on the\nunderground sky [of the prison], signs of the transcendence of\nconsciousness\u201d (CR, p. 120). The immanence of a life lived for\npower and might is contrasted with the interiority of a conscious\nfeeling of transcendence.\n3.2.3 Christianity\n\nFor Yorck, the Christian life is the breakthrough to a fully\nhistorical life. Unencumbered by the projection of objective knowledge\n(Greek metaphysics and ocularity) and freed from the expectation of a\nmessiah (hope for the promised future), the Christian lives the\ntemporality of \u201cabsolute aliveness\u201d [absolute\nLebendigkeit] in the depths of inwardness or\n interiority[20]\n (ST, p. 4). Since Christian consciousness has its dominant focus in\ninteriority and feeling, it is free from the cognitive and volitional\nbonds to any objectivity, but free for the rhythm of temporality and\nhistory. The Christian \u201cfreedom from the world\u201d\n[Weltfreiheit] (ST, p. 81) is at the same time freedom\nfor history and transcendence, i.e., the world-transcendent\nGod, and the personal, felt relationship to him, which is based on the\npersonal responsibility for one\u2019s historical life before God.\nYorck writes:\n\n\nThrough Christianity an essentially transcendent stance of\nconsciousness is achieved, namely by way of the basic factor of\nfeeling. This is a transcendent stance, in contradistinction to a\nmetaphysical\n one,[21]\n because feeling [Gef\u00fchl]\u2014the focal point of\naliveness [Lebendigkeit]\u2014is here turned inwards, even\nturned against itself and hence free of all givenness\n[Gegebenheit]. (ST, pp. 13/14)\n\n\nThe release from cognitive and volitional projection facilitates an\ninversion of life\u2019s tendency; it leaves behind the goals of\n\u201ccertainty and security\u201d (CR, p. 143) and grounds life in\nthe personal and intrinsically historical relationship to God.\n\nOn the one hand, Yorck emphasizes the absolute focus on inner life and\nindividual conscience, and the entirely unpredictable and historical\nrelationship to God, this side of all objective worldly realities and\npublic\n opinion.[22]\n The individual person is singled out in his relationship to God. On\nthe other hand, Yorck also holds that the Christian inversion of the\nprojective tendency of life ultimately results in\n\u201cself-renunciation\u201d [Selbstaufgabe], which\nexpresses the religious pole, opposite to ethical self-affirmation\nthrough philosophy and science. But precisely through this\nself-renunciation, life is lived as life, instead of being\nlost in the preoccupation with that which is merely intended through\nlife\u2014the objectively known and desired world. With reference to\nMatthew (10:39), Yorck writes:\n\n\nHe who finds his life, will lose it, he who loses it, will find it.\nThis word of the Lord describes the law of life itself, the basic\ncondition of all life. Death is a mark of life and the radical\ntranscendence of the deepest, the Christian standpoint postulates life\nas a mark of death. (ST, p. 58)\n\n\nYorck\u2019s well-known love for paradox has its definitive origin\n here.[23]\n\nFreed from the bonds to objective representation and the objective\nworld, Christian religion realizes the most concentrated or enhanced\nform of living life as life; it is \u201csupreme\naliveness\u201d [h\u00f6chste Lebendigkeit] and thus supreme\nhistoricity (ST, p. 104; CR, p. 154). The Christian life is not\ndistracted by the aims of cognition (objectivity) or the ties to\nobjects of desire within the world (in the past, present, or future).\nAccordingly, Yorck holds that the historical \u201corigin\u201d and\n\u201csupreme\u201d manifestation of life\u2014fully lived as\nhistorical life\u2014lies in Christianity.\n\nIn his Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften (1883),\nDilthey had made a similar, but by no means identical, point, arguing\nthat \u201chistorical consciousness\u201d first came into existence\nthrough the Christian freedom from the outer world (the cosmos) and\nthe newfound centre of life in inwardness (Dilthey 1959, p. 254).\nDilthey writes:\n\n\nFor the Greek mind, knowledge was the depiction [Abbilden] of\nsomething objective, [given] to intelligence. Now [after the emergence\nof Christianity], lived experience [Erlebnis] becomes the\ncentre point of all interests for the new communities; but this is\nnothing other than the simple, inner awareness [Innewerden]\nof what is given to the person in self-consciousness. (Dilthey 1959,\np. 251)\n\n\nYet Dilthey sees this as the first potential breakthrough to a new\nscience, the science of inner experience and the historical\ndisciplines, the Humanities or Geisteswissenschaften.\nAccording to Dilthey, Augustine\u2019s fateful dependence on Greek\nconceptuality made it impossible to fully articulate the new Christian\nsense of inwardness and history (Dilthey 1959, p. 264). Only through\nthe work of Schleiermacher and Kant has there been progress in\narticulating the original Christian insight into inwardness and\nhistoricity of life (Dilthey 1959, p. 267). Not only does Dilthey\nfully accept that the meaning of the original Christian experience is\nthus adequately comprehended and harnessed for the understanding, but\nhe also sees his own work on the logic of the historical sciences as a\ncontinuation and fulfilment of this same project.\n\nBy contrast, Yorck eschews all cooptation of the Christian\nbreakthrough to supreme historical aliveness and historicity for the\nestablishment of a science, fearing that this would not only\nconceptualize life as something \u201contic,\u201d always present\nand available for the understanding, but also ignore the vital\nconsciousness of transcendence, or bury it in a new\n scholasticism.[24]\n Yorck, who always regarded Luther\u2019s work as the vital\nre-affirmation of the early Christian historical life, suggests,\ntherefore, that instead of Kant and Schleiermacher, a return to\nLuther\u2019s conception of life is the more fruitful way of\nsafeguarding and cultivating the breakthrough to historical life.\nAcknowledging this difference, Yorck writes to Dilthey:\n\n\nYou will not agree when I say that Luther should and must be more\ntopical to the present time than Kant, if this present time is to have\na historical future [historische Zukunft].
