    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Idealist Musical Aesthetics: Schelling and Hegel\n1.3 Idealist Musical Aesthetics: Schelling and Hegel\n\nMusic\u2019s rise to prominence among the arts is signaled by the\nincreasing number of major philosophers who find space for it in their\nsystems. These include Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling\n(1775\u20131854) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831).\nThe greatest contribution of idealist philosophy to the aesthetics of\nmusic is perhaps the idea that music\u2019s temporal nature is\ncrucial to its peculiar status among the arts (see Johnson 1991:\n159).\n\nSchelling developed his philosophy of art in a series of lectures he\ngave in the years 1802\u201303 and 1804\u201305, although the result\nof these efforts was published only posthumously in 1859. He conceives\nof art as the manifestation of the Infinite in the Finite, and divides\nthe arts into formative (bildende, often rendered as\n\u201cfigurative\u201d) and verbal (redende). Formative\narts function by manipulating their characteristic material, that is,\ntheir medium, whereas verbal arts convey content semantically. Music\nbelongs to the formative arts, alongside painting and sculpture.\nSchelling distinguishes three elements in music: rhythm, modulation\n(harmony), and melody. On these he projects the triad of the formative\narts, claiming that rhythm is the musical in music, modulation the\npainterly, and melody the sculptural. As this suggests, Schelling\nbelieves rhythm, and more generally music\u2019s temporal dimension,\nto be of fundamental importance. Music\u2019s necessary form is\ntemporal succession. Rhythm allows us to perceive a multiplicity of\ntemporally contiguous moments as a unity, and thereby performs a\nfunction similar to that of self-consciousness, which allows us to\nperceive various experiences as a unified whole (Schelling 1859:\n\u00a779).\n\nSimilar ideas are developed in more rigorous and systematic fashion by\nHegel, whose reflections on music are embedded in an articulated\nsystem of the arts (see Moland 2019: chapter 9). This system is itself\nrelated to a historical analysis of art\u2019s development, which in\nturn is grounded in an idealist metaphysics. According to Hegel,\nreality coincides with a self-determining spiritual principle, or Idea\n(Idee). The Idea develops historically through branching\ntriadic patterns constituted by a thesis, or positive moment, its\nnegation or antithesis, and a synthesis of the two. Each moment may\nitself branch into a further triadic pattern, which is thus nested\nunder the higher-order ones. The highest forms of development of the\nIdea involve self-conscious Spirit (Geist), as we find it in\nhuman life and society. Spirit\u2019s third moment is absolute\nspirit, which in turn branches into art, religion, and philosophy, the\nlatter being the culmination of the Idea\u2019s unfolding.\nArt\u2019s relative proximity to philosophy is an indication of its\nrelatively high value in Hegel\u2019s eyes, and its contiguity to\nreligion will mean that at least some art will share some features\nwith religion. Whereas philosophy expresses the Spirit through\nconcepts, and religion does so through metaphors and representations,\nart is the sensuous expression of the Spirit\u2019s freedom. Beauty\nis thus defined as \u201cthe pure appearance of the Idea to\nsense\u201d (Hegel 1835: part I, chapter I, 3).\n\nAccording to Hegel, art may be further analyzed in terms of a triadic\nstructure, in such a way that we may distinguish its development\nthrough symbolic, classical, and romantic art. Hegel\u2019s system of\nthe individual arts is dependent on this historical unfolding, as the\nvarious art forms are differently suited to each of the three stages.\nSymbolic art falls short of art proper, and is in fact described by\nHegel as pre-art (Vorkunst), as it limits itself to offering\nsymbols of the Spirit, as opposed to giving an adequate sensory\npresentation of its freedom. Classical art is art at its fullest, as\nit gives a perfectly adequate sensuous presentation of the spiritual.\nHegel holds that this is best exemplified by classical Greek art, and\nparticularly sculpture. Romantic art (by which Hegel means Christian\nart from the Middle Ages onwards) is characterized by the expression\nof a content that transcends the visible realm, since it expresses an\ninward freedom, as opposed to an external one. Hegel writes:\n\n\nThe true content of romantic art is absolute inwardness, and its\ncorresponding form is spiritual subjectivity with its grasp of its\nindependence and freedom. (Hegel 1835: part II, section III,\nIntroduction, 2)\n\n\nThis content will then best be represented by religion, which follows\nart in the triadic sequence.\n\nBecause romantic art\u2019s content is inward freedom, sculpture is\nno longer adequate, as it is bound to the representation of\nthree-dimensional figures. Painting, however, abandons the third\ndimension, and is further able to express interiority through the use\nof color. But in subjective inwardness the spatial dimension is\naltogether absent. Its only appreciable dimension is that of the\ntemporal unfolding of our mental life, characterized by the rapid\nsuccession of states that replace one another in our consciousness.\nMusic is the art that is best suited to the expression of this inward\ndimension, as it abandons spatial extension entirely, and develops\nsolely through time. Music is thus the art form that is best suited to\nromantic art.\n\nThe perception of one\u2019s own persistence through time requires\ndiscrete events that break the otherwise continuous and identical\nstream of temporality. This is achieved in music through meter and\nrhythm, which subdivide the music\u2019s unfolding in ordered,\ndiscrete units. Harmony fills in this abstract structure with notes.\nMelody, which Hegel conceives of as a synthesis of rhythm and harmony,\nis the highest manifestation of music, \u201cthe sphere of its\nproperly artistic inventions\u201d (Hegel 1835: part III, section\nIII, chapter II, 2.c).\n\nMelody allows music to give sensuous manifestation to the freedom of\nthe Spirit by presenting feelings in their temporal unfolding. Hegel\ndoes not say much as to how melody achieves its expressive task. He\ncontrasts expression in music and painting, claiming that only the\nlatter is concerned with the exact reproduction of expressive\nbehavior. However, some kind of imitation of human expressions still\nseems to play a role in Hegel\u2019s account, as he then adds that in\nmusic\n\n\nthe simple cry is analysed into a series of notes, into a movement,\nthe change and course of which is supported by harmony and rounded\ninto whole by melody. (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II,\n3.a)\n\n\nThis framework allows Hegel to develop an original argument in support\nof the otherwise commonplace view that music moves us. The self is\nconstituted in time, and musical sounds exist in time. It is this\ncommon medium that allows music to exert such a powerful effect on our\nemotional life (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 1.c).\nPoetry shares with music its temporal and aural dimension, but it\nseparates medium from content, as the concepts conveyed by a poem are\narbitrarily linked to the words that constitute it, whereas\nmusic\u2019s content is inseparable from its sounding (Hegel 1835:\npart III, section III, chapter II, 1.a).\n\nHegel distinguishes between accompanying and independent music. To the\nformer belongs any work that involves music and a text, whereas the\nlatter is instrumental music. When music functions as an\naccompaniment, Hegel holds that the text should be subordinate to the\nmusic (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 3). Independent\nmusic is music at its full potential, as it is best able to express\nthe freedom of the Spirit, for subjective experience unfolds\nundetermined by concepts (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter\nII, 3.b). However, independent music also harbors a potential danger,\nas it may be tempted to rely on its formal complexity and forego\nemotional content entirely, in which case it would strictly speaking\ncease to be art (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II, 1.b).\nHere Hegel pairs a Romantic vindication of instrumental music as music\npar excellence with an eighteenth century suspicion of music\nthat is not expressive of emotions.\n\nThe originality of Hegel\u2019s musical thinking is also manifested\nin the few considerations he devotes to the role of the performer.\nThese are introduced and motivated by an observation on the mode of\nexistence peculiar to musical works: while in painting and sculpture\nwe appreciate the product of an activity, in music we appreciate the\nprocess of production (Hegel 1835: part III, section III, chapter II,\n3.c). Hegel then distinguishes two approaches to performance. The\nfirst relinquishes personal contributions on the part of the\nperformer, and seeks to render the work as faithfully as possible,\nwhereas the second allows the performer some initiative (Hegel 1835:\npart III, section III, chapter II, 3.c). Hegel claims that the two\napproaches bear a relation to accompanying and independent music,\nrespectively, but does not imply that each approach is best suited to\nits corresponding kind of music.\n",
