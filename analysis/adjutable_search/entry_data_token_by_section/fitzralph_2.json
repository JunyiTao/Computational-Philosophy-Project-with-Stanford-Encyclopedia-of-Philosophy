Position in the History of Philosophy\n\n\nAlthough many hold that FitzRalph later turned away from\nscholasticism (Leff 1963: 175), this point has been refuted by W. Duba\n(Duba 2013: 104). FitzRalph\u2019s lectures on the\nSentences have turned out to be of greater importance than\nmight have at first been realized by some authors such as Leff. Leff\nsaw FitzRalph\u2019s approach as being heavily influenced by the\nneo-Augustinian movement deriving ultimately from Henry of Ghent.\nLeff\u2019s summation of FitzRalph is rather negative, holding that\nFitzRalph shows an unwillingness to be deeply involved in the\ncontroversies of his time, and that he was content to \u201crestate\nwhat his contemporaries re-formulated\u201d (Leff 1963: 175).  This\nassessment, however, leaves one wondering what there was about\nFitzRalph\u2019s ideas that his contemporaries such as Holcot and\nWodeham, and later, Gregory of Rimini and Pierre d\u2019Ailly, found\nso challenging. In fact, contrary to Leff\u2019s assessment recent\nscholarship affirms that FitzRalph was one of the leading protagonists\nof the Oxford of his day and at a time when Oxford briefly eclipsed\nthe University of Paris in importance.\n\n\nIn philosophical matters FitzRalph generally follows Aristotle, but an\nAristotle who is constantly read through the lens of his\nCommentator. Averro\u00ebs is taken by FitzRalph to be the authentic\ninterpreter of Aristotle despite the condemnations of the 1270s, but\nin so doing FitzRalph is not an Averroist (as some surmised) but is\nmerely following the accepted practice of the times. For example, he\nis not, as one would expect, Averroistic in accepting the doctrine of\na single soul and indeed doubts whether it is truly\nAverro\u00ebs\u2019s teaching. Aquinas, when mentioned, is treated\nwith respect and FitzRalph follows him on a number of important\npoints. Perhaps owing to a certain national loyalty, Anselm receives\nsignificant (though not uncritical) attention. Grosseteste too\nreceives occasional mention. Again, as one might expect, Augustine is\nthe guide in theological matters, but FitzRalph does not content\nhimself to give references to Augustine\u2019s works. In fact, he\ntends to provide long quotations from Augustine, indicating a close\npersonal reading, something he shared with his patron, Bishop John de\nGrandisson. Contemporaries are not named (contrary to the practice of\nWodeham or Holcot a few years later), and their contributions have to\nbe identified (as does indeed FitzRalph\u2019s own positions) in the\ncourse of his presentation of each topic in the text which usually\ninvolves an examination of the answers given by Aquinas, Henry of\nGhent and Duns Scotus. FitzRalph would have perhaps felt closest in\nspirit to (though not always agreeing with) the neo-Augustinianism of\nHenry of Ghent; in method and approach, however, he seems closest to\nDuns Scotus. However, the techniques he employs are something he holds\nin common with his contemporaries, and it was these, it seems,\ntogether with the high quality of his arguments which appealed to\nother writers down to Jacques Almain and Francisco de Vitoria.\n\n\nThere is little or no evidence of radicalism in FitzRalph\u2019s\nearly writings such as Lectura which would anticipate the\npolemical Armachanus attacking the privileges of the mendicant orders\nat the papal court at Avignon in the 1350s. The later FitzRalph was a\nsocially conscious prelate who reprimanded his Anglo-Irish audience in\nhis sermons regarding their unjust treatment of the Gaelic Irish\npopulation. It was in this context that he developed his\nteaching on dominium, a doctrine which would have long-term\nimplications through his influence on Wyclif (Lahey 2003) or indeed in\nits rejection by later authors such as De Vitoria (Dunne 2004:\n243\u201358).\n",
