Overview: Basic Issues, Questions, and Distinctions\n\nVery little in the study of human life has been left untouched by\ndevelopments in evolutionary biology, and inquiry into the nature of\nmorality is no exception. With the recognition that we, like all other\nliving things, belong to a species that has evolved through natural\nselection comes the acknowledgement that evolutionary processes have\nlikewise shaped us deeply. How deeply?\n\nEvolutionary explanations are commonplace when it comes to questions\nabout our physiological nature\u2014why we have opposable thumbs,\nsay, or a bipedal posture. But even a brief look at other animals\naffords countless examples of adaptive psychological and\nbehavioral traits as well\u2014appetites for food or sex,\nfear responses, patterns of aggression, parental care and bonding, or\npatterns of cooperation and retribution; and these traits are likewise\noften best explained as biological adaptations, i.e., traits that\nevolved through natural selection due to their adaptive effects. (We\nwill go through a striking example involving cooperative behavior in\nsection 2.2.) This raises the question: to what extent might human\npsychological and behavioral traits similarly reflect our own\nevolutionary heritage?\n\nWhen it comes to morality, the most basic issue concerns our\ncapacity for normative guidance: our ability to be motivated\nby norms of behavior and feeling through judgments about how\npeople ought to act and respond in various circumstances\n(Joyce 2006, Kitcher 2006a,b, 2011, and Machery and Mallon 2010). Is\nthis human capacity a biological adaptation, having perhaps conferred\na selective advantage on our hominin ancestors by enhancing social\ncohesion and cooperation? (\u2018Hominin\u2019 refers, as did\n\u2018hominid\u2019 until very recently, to Homo sapiens\ntogether with fossil species of ape to which Homo sapiens are\nmore closely related than we are to chimpanzees; these include the\nAustralopithecines, extinct species of Homo, etc., making up\nthe tribe Hominini within the sub-family Homininae.)\n\nIf so, then it would be part of evolved human nature\nto employ moral judgment in governing human behavior, rather than a\nmere \u201ccultural veneer\u201d artificially imposed on an amoral\nhuman nature (de Waal 2006). This would be a significant result, and\nit is only the beginning of the intriguing questions that arise at the\nintersection of morality and evolutionary biology. Researchers are\nalso interested in the possibility of more specific forms of\nevolutionary influence. Are there, for example, emotional adaptations\nthat influence the very content of moral judgments and\nbehavior, even today?\n\nFor example, many of us believe that among our various moral duties,\nwe have special and stringent duties toward family members. Might this\n\u2018moral intuition\u2019 be attributable, at least in part, to an\nevolved tendency to favor members of one\u2019s kin group over others,\nanalogous to similar traits in other animals? Even where moral beliefs\nare heavily shaped by culture, there might be such evolutionary\ninfluences in the background: evolved psychological traits may have\ncontributed to the shaping of cultural practices themselves,\ninfluencing, for example, the development of \u201cfamily\nfirst\u201d cultural norms that inform our judgments. Similarly with\na tendency more generally to favor members of one\u2019s own group\n(however defined) over outsiders.\n\nThe above sorts of questions, which are receiving growing attention in\nthe sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a set of\nempirical phenomena to be explained: it is an empirical fact\nabout human beings that we make moral judgments, have certain feelings\nand behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the sciences to seek\ncausal explanations for such phenomena. At the same time, however, it\nis a very complex matter\u2014and one often neglected outside of\nphilosophy\u2014how such empirical, explanatory projects are related\nto the very different sets of questions and projects pursued by\nphilosophers when they inquire into the nature and source of\nmorality.\n\nMoral philosophers tend to focus on questions about the justification\nof moral claims, the existence and grounds of moral truths, and what\nmorality requires of us. These are very different from the empirical\nquestions pursued in the sciences, but how we answer each set of\nquestions may have implications for how we should answer the other. As\nwe will see, though the two sets of issues are distinct, the\nscientific explanatory projects raise potential challenges for certain\nphilosophical views, and at the same time attention to philosophical\nissues raises doubts about some of the explanatory claims made in the\nname of science, which often rely on controversial\nphilosophical assumptions. Progress in this area will not be made\neither by doing moral philosophy in isolation from the sciences or by\ntaking morality out of the hands of philosophers and looking to\nscientific inquiry in isolation. More promising would be a careful\nexamination of the ways in which the scientific and philosophical\nprojects inform each other.\n",
