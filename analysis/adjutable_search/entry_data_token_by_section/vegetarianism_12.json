    "main_text": "Extending Moral Vegetarian Arguments: Animal Products and Plants || Summary of Animal Product and Plant Subsections\n6. Conclusion: Where the Debate About Vegetarianism Stands and Is Going\n\nGiven length requirements, this entry cannot convey the vastness of\nthe moral vegetarian literature. There is some excellent work in the\npopular press. Between the Species, Journal of\nAgricultural and Environmental Ethics, Journal of Animal\nEthics, Environmental Ethics, and Journal of Food\nEthics publish articles yearly. Dozens of good articles have been\nomitted from discussion.\n\nThis entry has omitted quite direct arguments against consuming meat,\narguments that do not derive from premises about the wrongness of\nproducing this or that. Judeo-Islamic prohibitions on pork,\nfor example, derive from the uncleanliness of the product rather than\nthe manner of its production. Rastafari prohibitions on eating meat,\nfor another example, derive in part from the view that meat\nconsumption is unnatural. Historically, such prohibitions and\njustifications for them have not been limited to prohibitions on\nconsuming meat. The Laws of Manu\u2019s prohibition on\nonion-eating derives from what consuming onion will do to the consumer\nrather than the manner of onion-production (Doniger & Smith\n(trans.) 1991: 102). The Koran\u2019s prohibition on alcohol-drinking\nderives from what consuming alcohol will do to the consumer rather\nthan the manner of alcohol-production (5:90\u201391).\n\nArguments like this, arguments against consumption that start from\npremises about intrinsic features of the consumed or about the\nconsumed\u2019s effects on consumers, largely do not appear in the\ncontemporary philosophical literature. What we have now are arguments\naccording to which certain products are wrongfully produced and\nconsumption of such products bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing and, ipso facto, is wrong. Moral vegetarians then\nargue that meat is such a product: It is typically wrongfully produced\nand consuming it typically bears a certain relation to that\nwrongdoing. This then leaves the moral vegetarian open to two sorts of\nobjections: objections to the claims about\nproduction\u2014is meat produced that way? Is such\nproduction wrongful?\u2014and objections to the claims connecting\nconsumption to production\u2014is consuming meat related to\nwrongful production in the relevant way? Is being so related wrong?\nExplaining moral vegetarian answers to these questions was the work of\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a74.\n\nThere are further questions. If moral vegetarian arguments against\nmeat-consumption are sound, then are arguments against animal\nproduct consumption also sound? Might dairy, eggs, and honey\nbe wrongfully produced as moral vegetarians argue meat is? Might\nconsuming them wrongfully relate the consumer to that production?\nExplaining the case for \u201cyes\u201d was some of the work of\n \u00a75.\n\nRelatedly, some plants, fruit, nuts, and other putatively vegetarian\nfoods might be wrongfully produced. Some tomatoes are picked by\nworkers working in conditions just short of slavery (Bowe 2007);\nindustrial production of apples sucks up much water (Budolfson 2016);\nindustrial production of corn crushes numerous small animals to death\n(Davis 2003). Are these food wrongfully produced? Might consuming them\nwrongfully relate the consumer to that production? Explaining the case\nfor \u201cyes\u201d here, too, was some of the work of\n \u00a75.\n\nFischer (2018) suggests that the answers to some of the questions\nnoted in the previous two paragraphs support a requirement to\n\u201ceat unusually\u201d and, one might add, to produce unusually.\nIf meat, for example, is usually wrongfully produced, it must\nbe produced unusually for that production to stand a chance of being\npermissible, perhaps as faultless roadkill (Koelle 2012; Bruckner\n2015) or as the corpse of an animal dead from natural causes (Foer\n2009) or as a test-tube creation (Milburn 2016; Pluhar 2010; see the\nessays in Donaldson & Carter (eds.) 2016 for discussion of\nplant-based \u201cmeat\u201d).\n\nIf consuming meat is usually wrong because it usually bears a certain\nrelation to production, it must be consumed unusually to stand a\nchance of being permissible. Some people eat only food they scavenge\nfrom dumpsters, food that would otherwise go to waste. Some people eat\nonly food that is given to them without asking for any food in\nparticular. If consuming is wrong only because it produces\nmore production, neither of these modes of consumption would be\nwrongful.\n\nAs some unusual consumption might, by lights of the arguments\nconsidered in this entry, turn out to be morally unobjectionable, some\nperfectly usual practices having nothing to do with consumption might\nturn out, by those same lights, to be morally objectionable. Have you\ndone all you are required to do by moral vegetarian lights if you stop\neating, for example, factory-farmed animals? Clearly not. If it is\nwrong to eat a factory-farmed cow, it is for very similar\nreasons wrong to wear the skin of that cow. Does the wrongful\nroad stop at consumption, broadly construed to include buying, eating,\nor otherwise using? Or need consumers do more than not consume\nwrongfully-produced goods? Need they be pickier in how they spend\ntheir money than simply not buying meat, e.g., not going to\nrestaurants that serve any meat? Need they protest or lobby? Need they\ntake more direct action against farms? Or more direct action against\nthe government? Need they refuse to pay rent to landlords who buy\nwrongfully-produced meat? Is it permissible for moral vegetarians to\nbefriend\u2014or to stay friends with\u2014meat-eaters? As there are\nquestions about whether the moral road gets from production to\nconsumption, there are questions about whether the road stops at\nconsumption or gets much farther.\n\nAs discussed in\n \u00a75,\n the moral vegetarian case against killing, hurting, or raising\nanimals for food might well be extended to killing, hurting, or\nraising animals in other circumstances. What, if anything, do those\ncases show about the ethical treatment of pets (Bok 2011; Overall\n(ed.) 2017; Palmer 2010 and 2011)? Of zoo creatures (DeGrazia 2011;\nGruen 2011: Chapter 5; Gruen 2014)? \n\nWhat, if anything, do they show about duties regarding wild animals?\nPalmer 2010 opens with two cases from 2007, one of which involved the\naccidental deaths of 10,000 wildebeest in Kenya, the other involving\nthe mistreatment and death of 150 horses in England. As Palmer notes,\nit is plausible that we are required to care for and help domesticated\nanimals\u2014that\u2019s why it is plausibly wrong to let horses\nunder our care suffer\u2014but permissible to let similar harms\nbefall wild animals\u2014that\u2019s why it is plausibly permissible\nto let wildebeest suffer and die. And yet, Palmer continues, it is\nalso plausible that animals with similar capacities\u2014animals like\nhorses and wildebeest\u2014should be treated similarly. So is the\ntoleration of 10,000 wildebeest deaths permissible? Or do we make a\nmoral mistake in not intervening in such cases? Relatedly, moral\nvegetarians oppose chicken killing and consumption and yet some of\nthem aid and abet domestic cats in the killings of billions of birds\neach year in the United States alone (Loss, et al. 2013; Pressler\n2013). Is this permissible? If so, why (Cohen 2004; Milburn 2015;\nSittler-Adamczewski 2016)? McMahan (2015) argues that standard moral\nvegetarian arguments against killing and suffering lead (eventually)\nto the conclusion that we ought to reduce predation in the wild.\n\nWhat, if anything do moral vegetarian arguments show about duties\nregarding fetuses? There are forceful arguments that if abortion is\nwrong, then so is killing animals for food we don\u2019t need (Scully\n2013). The converse is more widely discussed but less plausible\n(Abbate 2014; Colb & Dorf 2016; Nobis 2016).\n\nFinally, in the food ethics literature, questions of food justice are\namong the most common questions about food consumption. Sexism,\nracism, and classism, are unjust. Among the issues of food justice,\nthen, are how, if at all, the practices of vegetarianism and\nomnivorism or encouragement of them are sexist (C. Adams 1990) or\nracist (Alkon & Agyeman (eds.) 2011) or classist (Guthman 2011).\nIndustrial animal agriculture raises a pair of questions of justice:\nIt degrades the environment\u2014is this unjust to future generations\nwho will inherit this degraded environment? Also, what makes it so\nenvironmentally harmful is the scale of it. That scale is driven, in\npart, by demand for meat among the increasingly affluent in developing\ncountries (Herrero & Thornton 2013). Is refusing to meet that\ndemand\u2014after catering to wealthy Western palates for a long\nstretch\u2014a form of classism or racism?\n\nThe animals we eat dominate the moral vegetarian literature and have\ndominated it ever since there has been a moral vegetarian literature.\nA way to think about these last few paragraphs is that questions about\nwhat we eat lead naturally to questions about other, quite different\ntopics: the animals we eat but also the animals we don\u2019t; eating\nthose animals but also eating plants; refusing to eat those animals\nbut also raising pets and refusing to intervene with predators and\nprey in the wild; refusing to eat but also failing to protest or\nrectify various injustices. Whereas the questions about\nanimals\u2014and the most popular arguments about them\u2014are very\nold, these other questions are newer, and there is much progress to be\nmade in answering them.\n",
