    "main_text": "\n\nUnde malum? What is evil\u2014if it is anything at\nall\u2014and whence does it arise? Is evil just badness by another\nname? Is it the inevitable \u201cshadow side\u201d of the good? Or\nis it more substantial: an active, striving force that is opposed to\nthe good in a Star Wars, Manichean kind of way?\n\nDoes evil always originate in the causal powers of nature? Is it\nsometimes based in the choices of moral agents? Or, perhaps most\ndisturbingly, does evil sometimes have its source in something\nnon-human and impersonal\u2014a malevolent tendency in the universe\nnot just to general winding-down but also to outbreaks of targeted\nhellishness?\n\nFinally, what is radical evil, and how does it differ from\nother kinds of evil?\n\nThese are some of the key metaphysical questions that\nphilosophers have raised concerning evil. The goal of this entry is to\nprovide a taxonomy of the most prominent answers: the main theories of\nevil\u2019s kinds and origins on offer in the\nwestern philosophical tradition. This is meant to supplement\nthe discussion in the entry on\n the concept of evil,\nalthough Section 1 begins with some conceptual and semantic\nissues.\n\nSection 2 introduces two key distinctions that are then further\ndeveloped in Sections 3 and 4. The first distinction has to do with\nthe kinds of evil: insofar as evil is anything at\nall, is it a deep metaphysical feature of things, or is it\nalways (or at least sometimes) merely an empirical\nphenomenon? The second distinction has to do with the origins\nof evil: is evil ever (or always) based in entirely natural\nphenomena, or does it sometimes (or always) have a moral or\nsupernatural origin?\n\nSections 5 through 7 consider some puzzling cases of\nhard-to-categorize evils: systemic evil; symbolic evil; and so-called\n\u201cradical\u201d evil.\n",
