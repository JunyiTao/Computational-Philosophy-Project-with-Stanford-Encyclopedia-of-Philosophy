    "main_text": "Varieties of Theory Theory || Model Theory Theory\n2.3 Model Theory Theory\n\nThe core TT assumption that FP is a kind of theory leaves open whether\nour everyday ToM is a set of conceptually articulated, propositional\nrepresentations that detail the core FP laws or whether it takes the\nform of a more flexible dynamic modeling of worldly structures.\nSeveral TTists, inspired by Giere (1988), maintain that our FP\nabilities are best explained by the tacit or unconscious processes of\nbuilding and utilizing models at the subpersonal level rather than by\nappeal to the use of an inherited and fixed set of FP laws (Maibom\n2003, 2007, 2009; Godfrey-Smith 2005).\n\nGodfrey-Smith (2005) proposes that elements of models of a given\ndomain have structural similarities with items in their target domain\nand that the modeling of specific domains exploits aspects of those\nstructural similarities for particular purposes. Going by this\ndefinition, if theorizing is understood as modeling then a ToM may,\nbut need not be, thought of as intrinsically propositional,\nrepresentational, or contentful (e.g., Maibom 2009; see also Egan\n2014, 2018).\n\nTo think of FP as best explained by the use of subpersonal models\nassumes the existence of a set of structures targeting specific\nmentalistic elements\u2014beliefs, desires, actions, emotions, and so\nforth. The Model TTist assumes that FP models can be elaborated in\nvarious ways to serve different purposes in different circumstances.\nFP models can be thought of as prediction devices: What will Fred do\nwhen he discovers the cafe is closed? Or a model might be\nused to arrive at FP explanations of action: Why did Fred go to the\ncafe? Or the  model might be elaborated upon to yield\nexplanations seeking to detail both proximate and distal causes\nof behavior. Models also admit other kinds of elaboration. For\nexample, a distinction between degrees of belief and desire might be\nintroduced, and rationality constraints imposed.\n\nMaibom (2009) argues that Model TT is well-placed to explain how we\nmanage to apply a ToM sensitively by adjusting to supporting,\ncontext-sensitive knowledge that cannot be supplied by a core ToM\nitself. In her view, Model TT can explain how it is possible to apply\nour ToM sensitively in ways that address the particularities of\nspecific cases.\n\nThe idea that our everyday ToM abilities depend on the use of a set of\nadjustable subpersonal models, as opposed to a fixed set of\npropositions describing FP laws, fits well with predictive processing\naccounts of cognition (Gopnik & Glymour 2002). Predictive\nprocessing accounts of perception hold that\u2014at its\ncore\u2014such cognitive activity always takes the form of making\ninferences concerning the hidden causes of sensory phenomena (Hohwy\n2013; Clark 2016). Advocates of the predictive processing variants of\nTT hold that the processes used in FP are of the same basic kind used\nelsewhere in every other variety of cognition, including acts of basic\nperception; the only difference is that in the case of FP the target\nof the activity is to infer how other minds cause actions (see, e.g.,\nGopnik & Wellman 2012; Bowers & Davis 2012; Koster-Hale &\nSaxe 2013; Hohwy & Palmer 2014; Palmer, Seth, & Hohwy 2015;\nPezzulo 2017; Zednik & J\u00e4kel 2016; Jara-Ettinger et al. 2016;\nJara-Ettinger 2019).\n\nMaking inferences about other minds can be understood as a matter of\nsolving an inverse problem, that of using observable evidence, in this\ncase, behaviors, to infer the invisible causal structure that produces\nit, in this case, presumably, mental states. Proponents of Model TT\nare free to assume that the models used in this process are complex,\noperating simultaneously on multiple scales and levels. In line with\npredictive processing assumptions, it is assumed that models\nimprove over time through the sustained effort of minimizing\nprediction error by adjusting predictions in response to mismatches\nbetween the content of top-down hypotheses and bottom-up\ninformation.\n\nLike all other versions of TT, an animating idea behind Model TT is\nthat the subpersonal work of brains is roughly analogous to what\nscientists do when making inferences in their efforts to best explain\nphenomena. The assumption is that brains develop generative models\nthat enable them to advance hypotheses\u2014and those hypotheses are\nfurther developed, refined, and improved by being tested against what\nthe world has to offer.\n\nFor all their promise, Model TT raises important questions that need\nfurther attention. These include: What is the evidential support for\nsuch accounts (Stuhlm\u00fcller & Goodman 2014)? What should we\nmake of their metaphysics? How seriously should we take the idea that\nbrains actually advance hypotheses and perform subpersonal modeling\noperations?\n\nSlors (2012), for example, warns of a tendency to think that ToM\nattributions are ubiquitous even in the face of challenges posed by\nthose who believe that the best explanations of our FP abilities do\nnot involve theorizing of any kind, at any level (see\n section 4.3).\n According to Slors\u2019s diagnosis, those who fall foul of this\ntemptation commit the model-model fallacy. He holds, the model-model\nfallacy occurs when a theorist systematically uses ToM models to\ndescribe what are, in fact, non-mentalizing social-cognitive\nprocesses. Though doing so may be valuable for various useful\ntheoretical or practical purposes, those who fall foul of this fallacy\nsystematically conflate features of the ToM models themselves with\nwhat goes on subpersonally when exercising our FP competence.\n",
