    "main_text": "Generalized 2D Semantics || Vindicating the traditional approach to meaning\n2.1 Vindicating the traditional approach to meaning\n\nIn the previous sections, we considered applications of the 2D\nframework that seek to explain the meaning of specific types of\nexpression: indexicals and modal operators. In contrast, proponents of\ngeneralized 2D semantics (G2D) believe that the 2D framework can be\nused to explain an important aspect of the meaning of all\nexpressions. In particular, G2D is meant to vindicate the traditional\nidea that we have apriori access to our own meanings through armchair\nreflection.\n\nAccording to the philosophical tradition, to know the meaning of a\nsubsentential expression like \u2018bachelor\u2019 is to implicitly\ngrasp a criterion that determines exactly which individuals count as\nbachelors in any possible situation. (Accounts of meaning broadly\nalong these lines were advanced by Plato, Descartes, Locke, Hume,\nFrege, Russell, Carnap, and many others.) On the traditional account,\nspeakers\u2019 implicit grasp of a criterion plays two key\ntheoretical roles:\n\nSemantic competence: Two speakers (or one speaker on two\noccasions) share the same meaning just in case they associate the very\nsame criterion with their expressions.\nReference determination: The criterion a speaker currently\nassociates with an expression determines which things fall into its\nextension in every possible situation.\n\n\nThe first claim requires that speakers who share the same meaning must\nshare a criterion for identifying the reference; while the second\nrequires that this criterion be veridical. If this traditional account\nof meaning is correct, then one can make one\u2019s own meanings\nexplicit by engaging in apriori conceptual analysis. Such\nconceptual analysis allows you to determine what exactly it takes to\ncount as a bachelor in any possible world; and it allows you to\nspecify what exactly someone must be prepared to accept in order to\ngenuinely agree or disagree about bachelors.\n\nG2D is a strategy for defending a variant of this traditional view of\nmeaning against a series of influential objections. In the\n1970s and 80s, semantic externalists used a variety of persuasive\nexamples to argue that the traditional account of meaning yields an\nunrealistic picture of (i) semantic competence, (ii) reference\ndetermination, and (iii) epistemic access to modal facts. Proper names\nand natural kind terms seem especially problematic for the traditional\n account.[9]\n By commonsense standards, you don\u2019t need to know a specific\nrule for identifying G\u00f6del in any possible world in order to\ncount as competent with the name \u2018G\u00f6del\u2019; and no such\nknowledge seems required for your use of the name to pick out the\nrelevant man in every possible world (Donnellan 1970; Kripke\n 1980).[10]\n Similarly, you don\u2019t need to know precisely what it takes for\nsomething to count as water in any possible world to be competent with\nthe word \u2018water\u2019 or for your word to pick out the chemical\nsubstance H2O in every possible world (Kripke 1980; Putnam\n1970, 1972). Indeed, making room for the possibility of ignorance and\nerror about reference-conditions seems crucial to explaining empirical\ninquiry into the nature of familiar things, and to vindicating the\ncommonsense realist idea that we can refer to things whose nature we\ndon\u2019t fully understand (Burge 1979, 1986; Putnam 1972, 1973). If\nthese critics are right, then the traditional account of meaning is\nuntenable. Implicit knowledge of reference-conditions is not\nrequired either for linguistic competence or for determinate\nreference. And apriori conceptual analysis cannot be trusted to reveal\nwhat\u2019s genuinely possible\u2014at best, it reveals one\u2019s\ncurrent fallible assumptions about the topic in question. [See the\nentry on\n externalism about mental content.]\n\nProponents of G2D believe this pessimistic conclusion is unwarranted.\nWhat critics\u2019 examples really show, they argue, is that the\ntraditional view of meaning should be refined, not junked. Moreover,\nthe 2D semantics developed for indexicals and modal operators suggests\na promising strategy for accommodating putative externalist\ncounterexamples within a broadly traditional account of meaning. In\nthe case of indexicals and rigidified definite descriptions, competent\nspeakers grasp a reference-fixing criterion without grasping\nthe modal profile of the object, kind, or property picked out\nby the expression. For instance, you can know that \u2018I\u2019\nalways refers to the speaker whenever it is uttered without knowing\nthe nature of the person who is actually picked (e.g., what it takes\nto be Barack Obama in any possible world). Perhaps our understanding\nof names and natural kind terms is structured in a similar way:\ncompetent speakers always have apriori access to the reference-fixing\ncriterion for their own use of the name \u2018Barack Obama\u2019,\nbut they have only aposteriori access to the associated modal profile.\nIf this suggestion is on the right track, then a G2D framework could\nbe used to clarify the nature of this semantic understanding. Moreover\nwe may be able to explain certain epistemic operators, like \u2018it\nis conceptually possible that\u2019 or \u2018it is apriori\nthat\u2019, as operating on such 2D semantic values.\n\nThe basic philosophical idea behind G2D\u2014that subjects have\napriori access to reference-fixing criteria for their words but not to\nthe modal profile of the subject matter picked out\u2014has been\nsuggested by a number of theorists. David Lewis, in particular, was a\npowerful champion of the idea that we can give apriori definitions for\nterms whose precise reference we do not understand. Lewis articulated\nthe \u2018analytic functionalist\u2019 approach to specifying the\nmeaning of mental predicates and of theoretical terms in science\n(1966; 1970; 1972; 1979; 1980; 1994); and he was also an early\nadvocate of a generalized 2D approach to semantics (1981; 1994). Other\ninfluential proponents of the idea that we can have implicit knowledge\nof reference-fixing criteria without knowing the modal profile of the\nreference include Michael Dummett (1973; 1981), Gareth Evans (1982),\nand John Searle (1983). Early proponents of an explicitly\ntwo-dimensional semantics for names and natural kind terms include\nHarry Deutsch (1990, 1993), Ulrike Haas-Spohn (1995), and Kai-Yee Wong\n(1996). However, it is two later theorists\u2014Frank Jackson (1994;\n1998a; 1998b; 2004) and David Chalmers (1996; 2002b; 2002c; 2004;\n2006a)\u2014who have most systematically developed and defended G2D\nas a way of reconciling the lessons of semantic externalism with the\ntraditional apriori approach to meaning and modality.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that G2D has been motivated primarily by\nepistemic, metasemantic, and metaphysical concerns, rather than by\nissues in compositional semantics. In particular, G2D seeks to\nvindicate the traditional idea that we can know the truth-conditions\nof our own sentences via armchair reasoning about hypothetical cases.\nThe approach promises to explain why certain necessary truths can only\nbe known aposteriori by appealing to the structure of our implicit\nsemantic understanding. Proponents of G2D make claims about how the\ntwo types of intension may interact with modal and epistemic\noperators. However, working out the details of the compositional\nsemantics has been a relatively recent concern of proponents of G2D\n(e.g. Chalmers 2011a, c; Chalmers and Rabern 2014; Johannesson and\nPackal\u00e9n 2016; Kipper 2017).\n\nThe 2D semantic frameworks proposed by Jackson and Chalmers are very\nsimilar in their broad aims and formal structure, and commentators\noften treat the two versions as interchangeable. However, the two\nframeworks are developed in the service of two quite different\nphilosophical projects, emphasizing different aspects of the\ntraditional approach to meaning. Jackson takes up the traditional\nempiricist project of explaining empirical facts about language use\nand communication, while Chalmers pursues a broadly rationalist\nproject of explaining key structural interconnections between meaning,\napriority, and possibility. This difference in explanatory aims leads\nto different interpretations of the 2D framework.\n",
