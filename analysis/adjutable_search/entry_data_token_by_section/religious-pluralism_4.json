Religious Diversity and Apologetics\n\nLet us assume that exclusivists are justified in retaining their\nexclusivistic belief in the face of religious diversity. Ought they\nstop there or can they justifiably go further? Can they justifiably\ntry to convince others of their rightness\u2014can they justifiably\ntry to convert others to their perspective? And if so, are they in any\nsense obligated to do so?\n\nMost who believe that such proselytization is not justified challenge\nthe moral character of exclusivists who attempts to convince those\nwith whom they differ to accept their perspective as the sole truth.\nFor instance, Wilfred Cantwell Smith argues that \u201cexcept at the\ncost of insensitivity or delinquency, it is morally not possible\nactually to go out into the world and say to devout, intelligent\nfellow human beings [that] we believe that we know God and we are\nright; you believe that you know God, and you are totally wrong\u201d\n(Smith 1976, 14). And when Runzo claims that exclusivism can be\n\u201chighly presumptive\u201d and \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d\n(Runzo 1988, 348) or John Hick maintains that exclusivists often\nmanifest a sort of arbitrariness or arrogance (Hick 1989, 235), they\ntoo appear to be challenging the moral character of those who attempt\nto convert others to their perspective.\n\nNot surprisingly, most exclusivists deny that it is insensitive or\narrogant or presumptive for exclusivists to attempt to convince others\nthat the exclusivistic perspective is alone the correct one. Since we\nare justified in believing our position to be superior to\nothers\u2014closer to the truth\u2014it is difficult to see,\nexclusivists argue, how our attempts to convince others that they\nshould agree can be considered arrogant or presumptive or insensitive,\nespecially if we believe that it is important for the welfare of those\nwe are attempting to convert that they do so. Moreover, exclusivists\ncontinue, while it is surely true that some conversion is attempted\nfor what we would all agree are morally inappropriate\nreasons\u2014for instance, for financial gain or to gain power over\nothers\u2014there is little empirical evidence that exclusivists in\ngeneral have these motives. It is probably true, rather, that many, if\nnot most, exclusivists who proselytize do so primarily because they\nbelieve they have what others need and are willing (sometimes at great\npersonal cost) to share it with them.\n\nAre, though, exclusivists required to proselytize? Many exclusivistic\nreligious systems do require proselytization, and most philosophers\nwho believe that exclusivists are justified in retaining their\nexclusivistic beliefs in the face of religious diversity believe also\nthat these exclusivists can justifiably feel obligated to attempt to\n\u201cconvert\u201d their epistemic competitors. With very few\nexceptions, though, philosophers deny that exclusivists are under any\ngeneral obligation to proselytize, regardless of whether the\nexclusivistic system in question demands or encourages such\n proselytization.[6]\n",
