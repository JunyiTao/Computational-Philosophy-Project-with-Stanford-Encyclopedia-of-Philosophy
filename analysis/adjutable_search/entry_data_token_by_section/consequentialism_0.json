    "main_text": "Classic Utilitarianism\n1. Classic Utilitarianism\n\nThe paradigm case of consequentialism is utilitarianism, whose classic\nproponents were Jeremy Bentham (1789), John Stuart Mill (1861), and\nHenry Sidgwick (1907). (For predecessors, see Schneewind 1997, 2002.)\nClassic utilitarians held hedonistic act consequentialism. Act\nconsequentialism is the claim that an act is morally right if and\nonly if that act maximizes the good, that is, if and only if the total\namount of good for all minus the total amount of bad for all is\ngreater than this net amount for any incompatible act available to the\nagent on that occasion. (Cf. Moore 1912, chs. 1\u20132.)\nHedonism then claims that pleasure is the only intrinsic good\nand that pain is the only intrinsic bad.\n\nThese claims are often summarized in the slogan that an act is right\nif and only if it causes \u201cthe greatest happiness for the\ngreatest number.\u201d This slogan is misleading, however. An act can\nincrease happiness for most (the greatest number of) people but still\nfail to maximize the net good in the world if the smaller number of\npeople whose happiness is not increased lose much more than the\ngreater number gains. The principle of utility would not allow that\nkind of sacrifice of the smaller number to the greater number unless\nthe net good overall is increased more than any alternative.\n\nClassic utilitarianism is consequentialist as opposed to deontological\nbecause of what it denies. It denies that moral rightness depends\ndirectly on anything other than consequences, such as whether the\nagent promised in the past to do the act now. Of course, the fact that\nthe agent promised to do the act might indirectly affect the\nact\u2019s consequences if breaking the promise will make other\npeople unhappy. Nonetheless, according to classic utilitarianism, what\nmakes it morally wrong to break the promise is its future effects on\nthose other people rather than the fact that the agent promised in the\npast (Sinnott-Armstrong 2009).\n\nSince classic utilitarianism reduces all morally relevant factors\n(Kagan 1998, 17\u201322) to consequences, it might appear simple.\nHowever, classic utilitarianism is actually a complex combination of\nmany distinct claims, including the following claims about the moral\nrightness of acts:\n\n\nConsequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on\nconsequences (as opposed to the circumstances or the\nintrinsic nature of the act or anything that happens before the\nact).\n\nActual Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only\non the actual consequences (as opposed to foreseen,\nforeseeable, intended, or likely consequences).\n\nDirect Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only\non the consequences of that act itself (as opposed to the\nconsequences of the agent\u2019s motive, of a rule or practice that\ncovers other acts of the same kind, and so on).\n\nEvaluative Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the\nvalue of the consequences (as opposed to non-evaluative\nfeatures of the consequences).\n\nHedonism = the value of the consequences depends only on the\npleasures and pains in the consequences (as opposed\nto other supposed goods, such as freedom, knowledge, life, and so\non).\n\nMaximizing Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on which\nconsequences are best (as opposed to merely satisfactory or\nan improvement over the status quo).\n\nAggregative Consequentialism = which consequences are best is some\nfunction of the values of parts of those consequences (as\nopposed to rankings of whole worlds or sets of consequences).\n\nTotal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the\ntotal net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average\nnet good per person).\n\nUniversal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends on the\nconsequences for all people or sentient beings (as opposed to\nonly the individual agent, members of the individual\u2019s society,\npresent people, or any other limited group).\n\nEqual Consideration = in determining moral rightness, benefits to one\nperson matter just as much as similar benefits to any other\nperson (as opposed to putting more weight on the worse or worst\noff).\n\nAgent-neutrality = whether some consequences are better than others\ndoes not depend on whether the consequences are evaluated from the\nperspective of the agent (as opposed to an observer).\n\n\nThese claims could be clarified, supplemented, and subdivided further.\nWhat matters here is just that most pairs of these claims are\nlogically independent, so a moral theorist could consistently accept\nsome of them without accepting others. Yet classic utilitarians\naccepted them all. That fact makes classic utilitarianism a more\ncomplex theory than it might appear at first sight.\n\nIt also makes classic utilitarianism subject to attack from many\nangles. Persistent opponents posed plenty of problems for classic\nutilitarianism. Each objection led some utilitarians to give up some\nof the original claims of classic utilitarianism. By dropping one or\nmore of those claims, descendants of utilitarianism can construct a\nwide variety of moral theories. Advocates of these theories often call\nthem consequentialism rather than utilitarianism so that their\ntheories will not be subject to refutation by association with the\nclassic utilitarian theory.\n",
