    "main_text": "Aspatial Theories || Sounds as Pure Events\n4.3 Sounds as Pure Events\n\nScruton (2009a, 2009b; see also his 1997) proposes a non-physicalist\naccount of sounds. He is impressed by the fact that when we hear\nsounds as music we (can) hear them as events detached from their\nphysical causes. He then suggests that sounds are \u201cpure\nevents\u201d, things that happen but which don\u2019t happen to\nanything, and that they are \u201csecondary objects\u201d, entities\nwhose nature is bound up with the way we perceive them.\n\nOne way of reconciling Scruton\u2019s interesting suggestions with a\nphysicalist account of sounds is to draw a distinction (which of\ncourse should be properly developed) between the ontology we need to\naccount for our ecological ability to hear sounds in our natural\nenvironment and the ontology we need to account for our (at least\npartly acquired) ability to hear sounds as music. Eventually, the\nontology of sounds as music, which Scruton wants to focus on, might be\nquite different from the ontology of natural sounds, which can still\nbe of the physicalist kind.\n",
