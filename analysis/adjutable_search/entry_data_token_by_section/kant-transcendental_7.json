Contemporary World-Directed Transcendental Arguments\n\nKant-inspired transcendental arguments against skepticism about the\nexternal world were developed with vigor in the mid-twentieth century,\nnotably by P. F. Strawson, most famously in his Kantian reflections in\nThe Bounds of Sense (1966). These arguments are often\nreinterpretations of, or at least inspired by, Kant\u2019s\nTranscendental Deduction and his Refutation of Idealism. Some are more\nambitious than Kant\u2019s would seem to be, insofar as they attempt\nto refute some variety of skepticism by showing that there is an\nessential commitment of the skeptical position for which the falsity\nof that position is a necessary condition (Nagel 1997: 60ff.).\nStrawson\u2019s most famous transcendental argument (1966:\n97\u2013104) is modeled on the Transcendental Deduction, but\nexplicitly without a commitment to synthesis or any other aspect of\nKant\u2019s transcendental psychology. His target is a purely\nsense-datum experience, which does not feature objects,\n\u201cconceived of as distinct from any particular states of\nawareness of them,\u201d that is, a Berkeleyan experience of spatial\nobjects whose esse is percipi (1966: 98). The core\nof the argument is as follows. From the premise that every (human)\nexperience is such that it is possible for its subject to become aware\nof it and ascribe it to herself, we can infer that in every experience\nthe subject must be capable of distinguishing a recognitional\ncomponent not wholly absorbed by, and thus distinct from, the item\nrecognized (1966: 100). From this we can infer that the subject must\nconceptualize her experiences in such a way so as to contain the basis\nfor a distinction between a subjective component \u2013 how the\nexperienced item seems to the subject, and an objective component\n\u2013 how the item actually is. Strawson specifies that\n\u201ccollectively,\u201d this comes to \u201cthe distinction\nbetween the subjective order and arrangement of a series of such\nexperiences on the one hand, and the objective order and arrangement\nof the items of which they are the experiences on the other\u201d\n(1966: 101). Conceptualizing experience as involving an objective\norder and arrangement of items amounts to making objectively valid\njudgments about it, which, in turn, implies that experience must\nconsist of a rule-governed connectedness of representations (1966:\n98). Summarizing, from a premise about self-consciousness, we can\ninfer that the subject must conceptualize her experience so as to\nfeature a distinction between \u201cthe subjective route of his\nexperience and the objective world through which it is a route,\u201d\nwhere the experience of the objective world consists in a\nrule-governed order of representations (1966: 105).\n\nBarry Stroud, in his 1968 article \u201cTranscendental\nArguments,\u201d issued a formidable challenge to the enterprise of\ndefeating the external-world skeptic by transcendental arguments of\nthis sort (Stroud 1968). There Stroud contends that such\ntranscendental arguments are undermined by a problem which can be\nstated quite generally. These arguments feature reasoning from some\naspect of experience or knowledge to the claim that the contested\nfeature of the external world in fact exists. In each case the\nexistence of the external feature will not be a necessary\ncondition of the aspect of experience or knowledge in question, for a\nbelief about the external feature would always suffice.\nAlthough the claim about existence of the aspect of the external world\ncould be secured if certain kinds of verificationism or idealism were\npresupposed, these views are highly controversial. Besides, one could\nmake as much of an inroad against the skeptic armed with the\nverificationism or idealism alone, without adducing the transcendental\nargument at all (cf. Brueckner 1983, 1984).\n\nAlthough Strawson\u2019s transcendental argument in The Bounds of\nSense is not a specific target in Stroud\u2019s (1968), Anthony\nBrueckner suggests that it is susceptible to the line of criticism\nthat Stroud develops (Brueckner 1983: 557\u20138). For, arguably,\nStrawson can only conclude that experience must be conceptualized in a\ncertain way, such as to allow the subject to make the distinction\nbetween an objective world and her subjective path through it. This is\nnot a conclusion about how a mind-independent world must be, but only\nabout how it must be thought. (Alternatively, Strawson might be read\nas drawing only a conclusion about how experience must be\nconceptualized, which would render the transcendental argument as one\nof a more modest variety (see below)).\n\nRecent developments of transcendental arguments reflect a struggle to\naccommodate Stroud\u2019s criticism, and often chastened expectations\nabout what such arguments might establish by way of refuting\nskepticism. One more modest sort of transcendental argument begins\nwith a premise about experience or knowledge that is acceptable to the\nskeptic in question, and then proceeds not to the existence of some\naspect of the external world, but in accord with Stroud\u2019s\ncriticism, to a belief in the existence of some aspect of the external\nworld. Stroud himself advocates a strategy of this sort (Stroud 1994,\n1999), as does Robert Stern (1999). The kind proposed by Stroud begins\nwith the premise that we think of the world as being independent of\nus, and it concludes, as a necessary condition of this premise, that\nwe must think of it as containing enduring particulars. Such an\nargument does not claim that as a necessary condition of this premise\nthere must exist such particulars. It contends only for \u201ca\nconnection solely within our thought: if we think in certain ways, we\nmust think in certain other ways\u201d (Stern 1999: 165). A belief or\nthought to which one reasons in this way would, in Stroud\u2019s\nconception, have a certain indispensability, \u201cbecause\nno belief that must be present in any conception or any set of beliefs\nabout an independent world could be abandoned consistently with our\nconception of the world at all,\u201d and it would be\ninvulnerable \u201cin the special sense that it could not be\nfound to be false consistently with its being found to be held by\npeople\u201d (Stern 1999: 166).\n\nStern advances a conception of this kind of argument on which it\naddresses a skeptic who questions whether certain beliefs cohere with\nothers in one\u2019s set, as opposed to a skeptic who questions\nwhether certain beliefs are true (Stern 1999). A modest transcendental\nargument would then aim to show that a belief whose coherence with the\nother beliefs is challenged so coheres after all. The requisite\ncoherence might be demonstrated by showing that the belief in question\nis actually a necessary condition of a belief that is indispensable\n(in some coherentist sense) to one\u2019s set. Mark Sacks (1999)\nobjects that if at the same time one were to admit that the belief\nmight not be true, one\u2019s sense that one is justified in holding\nthe belief would be undermined. This worry is a serious one. Sacks\nargues that it arises because of a tension between the coherentist\ntheory of justification and the realist correspondence theory of truth\nthat the external world skeptic presupposes. One might respond, he\npoints out, by accepting a coherence theory of truth as well, but this\nwould be to adopt a version of idealism. Moreover, it seems that\nSacks\u2019s proposal would not solve the problem, for the reason\nthat even if one accepted a coherence theory of truth, one would still\nhave to admit that for specific instances of a belief one might be\nmistaken, even if one maintained that one was justified in holding\nthat belief on grounds of coherence.\n\nAn important criticism of Stroud\u2019s proposed sort of modest\ntranscendental argument is raised by Brueckner (1996). Brueckner\naddresses the fit between the claim that certain non-skeptical beliefs\nare invulnerable in Stroud\u2019s sense, and the admission that they\nmight not be true. More precisely, he challenges the claim that one\ncan simultaneously affirm the following two principles, each gleaned\nfrom Stroud (1994):\n\n(CT) If we attribute beliefs to speakers (if we believe that they have\nbeliefs with determinate contents), then we must also believe that\nthere is an independent world of enduring objects with which they\ninteract.\n\n\nand\n\n(SK) Although we believe many things about a world independent of us\nand our experiences, \u2026 none of those beliefs is true.\n\n\nBrueckner divides (SK) into\n\nwe believe many things about an external reality independent of us\nand our experiences\n\n\nand\n\nnone of these beliefs is true.\n\n\nStroud argues, in effect, that given CT we cannot believe that (i) and\n(ii) are true, but nonetheless, we can believe that (i) and (ii) are\nlogically compossible given CT. Brueckner argues that using similar\nreasoning, given CT we cannot conceive of a possible world in which\nboth (i) and (ii) hold, and this fact undermines Stroud\u2019s claim.\nTo conceive of a world W in which (i) is true is to conceive of a\nworld in which we (in the actual world) attribute beliefs about\nmind-independent objects to counterfactual versions of us (CVs) in W.\nBut given CT, we must now also conceive of W as featuring\nmind-independent objects with which these CVs interact. Consider the\nCVs\u2019 belief that there exist mind-independent objects\n\u2013 a belief they share with us. This belief of theirs will be\ntrue. And thus in W (ii) will be false. Hence we have not conceived of\na world in which given CT, SK is nevertheless true, and indeed, we\nwill not be able to conceive of such a world. But our not being able\nto conceive of a possible world in which given CT, SK is true,\nconstitutes strong evidence against the claim that SK is logically\npossible given CT (1996: 274\u201375). Brueckner does not think that\nthis argument demonstrates that it is inconsistent to accept CT and\nassert that SK is logically possible, but that there will be no\nevidence of the usual kind for this claim \u2013 evidence from\nconceivability. Thus given the transcendental argument he advances,\nStroud will be pushed in the direction of the immodest conclusion that\nit is not possible for us to be mistaken in our belief that there\nexist mind-independent objects.\n\nFrom this one might be tempted to conclude that despite his critique\nof 1968, Stroud, with Brueckner\u2019s assistance, has found a\ntranscendental argument that does in fact establish a conclusion about\nthe external world. However, so far nothing has been said to turn back\nStroud\u2019s 1968 critique, and it seems much more likely that the\nargument Stroud now advances can at best conclude with a version of CT\nin which the term \u201cindependent\u201d must be read in a\ntranscendentally ideal sense \u2013 in which, for example, the nature\nof certain physical objects is determined by our best scientific\ntheories about them, and our sensory experiences can be in error about\nthese objects. And if this is so, then the argument would secure a\nbelief about the external world only on the presupposition of\nmetaphysical idealism, and this is one of the ways in which\nanti-skeptical transcendental arguments might be doomed according to\nStroud\u2019s 1968 critique.\n\nDespite these sorts of challenges, the aspiration to forge\ntranscendental arguments with considerable anti-skeptical force has\nnot waned. Qassim Cassam (1999), Sacks (2000), and Stern (2000), for\nexample, have developed creative and nuanced versions of\ntranscendental arguments designed to negotiate the type of problem\nStroud has pressed.\n",
