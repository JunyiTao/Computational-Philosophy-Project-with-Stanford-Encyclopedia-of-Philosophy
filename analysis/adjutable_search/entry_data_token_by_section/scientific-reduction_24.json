The majority within the\nphilosophy of science has nowadays abandoned the unificationist\nprogram, to which reduction was intimately connected right from the\nstart. However, as became apparent only in recent years, some\nquestions regarding the concept of reduction have not successfully\nbeen accounted for yet, and recent developments in metaphysics in\nconnection with metaphysical grounding may shed new light on the\nconcept of reduction.\n",
