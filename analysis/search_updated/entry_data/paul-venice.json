    "preamble": "\n\nPaul of Venice was the most important Italian thinker of his times,\nand one of the most prominent and interesting logicians of the Middle\nAges. His philosophical theories (culminating in a metaphysics of\nessences which states the ontological and epistemological primacy of\nuniversals over any other kind of beings) are the final and highest\nresult of the preceding realistic tradition of thought. He fully\ndeveloped the new form of realism started up by Wyclif and his Oxonian\nfollowers in the last decades of the 14th century, and\nrenewed Burley\u2019s attacks against nominalistic views. The\nmetaphysical convictions at the basis of his philosophy are an\noriginal version of the most fundamental theses of Duns Scotus (viz.\nunivocity of being; existence of universal forms outside the mind,\nwhich are at the same time identical with and different from their own\nindividuals; real identity and formal distinction between essence and\nbeing; thisness as the principle of individuation; real distinction\namong the ten categories). But Paul puts much more stress on the\nontological presuppositions and entailments of the doctrine.\nSimultaneously, he was open to influences from many other directions,\nas he held in due consideration also the positions of authors such as\nAlbert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, and Giles of Rome, and critically\ndiscussed the doctrines of the main Nominalists of the 14th\ncentury, namely William Ockham, John Buridan, and Marsilius of Inghen,\nsometimes playing mutually incompatible theses against each other.\nThis contributes to making his works stimulating and enriching from an\nhistorical point of view, but also makes it difficult to grasp his own\nideas in their relationships and unity. These reflections help us to\nexplain why for about one hundred and fifty years Paul was\nerroneously, but unanimously, believed to be an Ockhamist in\nlogic and metaphysics and an Averroist in psychology and\nepistemology.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nPaul of Venice (Paulus Nicolettus Venetus, Paolo Nicoletti Veneto),\nO.E.S.A. was born in Udine, Italy, around 1369. He joined the\nAugustinian order near the age of fourteen, when he entered the\nconvent of Santo Stefano in Venice. He studied first at Padua, but in\n1390 he was assigned to Oxford, where he spent three years. He became\nDoctor of Arts and Theology by 1405. He taught in Padua, Siena\n(1420\u201324), and Perugia (1424\u201328), and lectured in Bologna\n(1424). At various times he held positions of leadership in his order\n(Pope Gregory XII designated him Prior General of the Augustinians in\nMay 1409) and served as ambassador of the Venetian Republic. He died\nin Padua on 15 June 1429, while commenting the De anima\n(On the Soul) of Aristotle.\n\nPaul wrote many philosophical and theological treatises (the complete\nlist of his writings and a guide to extant manuscripts are in Perreiah\n1986; for the dating of his main philosophical works see Conti 1996,\npp. 9\u201320), including: Logica parva (The Small\nLogic), ca. 1393\u201395; Logica magna (The Great\nLogic\u2014LM), ca. 1396\u201399; Sophismata aurea\n(Golden Sophisms), ca. 1399; a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics (In Post.),\nC.E. 1406; Summa philosophiae naturalis (Summa of Natural\nPhilosophy\u2014SN), C.E. 1408; a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics (In Phys.), C.E. 1409; a\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul (In De\nanima), ca. 1415\u201320; Quaestio de universalibus\n(On Universals\u2014QdU), ca. 1420\u201324; a\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics (In\nMetaph.), ca. 1420\u201324; a commentary on the Ars\nVetus, that is, on Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge,\nAristotle\u2019s Categories, and the Liber sex\nprincipiorum (Expositio super Universalia Porphyrii et Artem\nVeterem Aristotelis\u2014In Porph., In Cat.,\nand In Sex pr. respectively), C.E. 1428.\n2. Logic\n\nThe main contributions of Paul of Venice to the history of logic in\nthe Middle Ages concern the notion of formal distinction and the\nanalysis of predication.\n2.1 Identities and Distinctions\n\nPaul\u2019s formulation of the theory of identity and distinction is\na further development of Duns Scotus\u2019 and Wyclif\u2019s\ndoctrines on the subject. The Italian master recognizes two main types\nof identity: material (secundum materiam) and formal\n(secundum formam). There is material identity when the\nmaterial cause is the same, either in number (it is a case of the same\nthing called in different ways) or by species (it is a case of two\nobjects made of the same kind of stuff). There is formal identity when\nthe formal cause is the same. This happens in two ways: if the form at\nissue is the singular form of the individual composite, then there is\na unique object known in different ways; if the form at issue is the\ncommon essence instantiated by the singular form, then there are two\ndistinct objects belonging to the same species or genus (In\nMetaph., book V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185ra). Correspondingly,\nthe main types of distinction (or difference) are also two: material\nand formal. There is material distinction when the material cause is\ndifferent, so that the objects at issue are separable entities. In\ngeneral, there is formal distinction when the formal cause is\ndifferent. This happens in two ways: if the material cause is also\ndifferent, then it is a particular case of material distinction. If\nthe material cause is the same, then a further analysis is necessary.\nIf the material cause is the same by species only, then it is an\nimproper case of formal distinction; but if the material cause is the\nsame in number, then there is properly formal distinction, since the\nforms at issue have different definite descriptions but share the same\nsubstrate of existence, so that they are one and the same thing in\nreality. For example, there is a proper formal distinction in the case\nof the two properties of being-capable-of-laughing (risibile)\nand of being-capable-of-learning (disciplinabile), which are\nconnected forms instantiated by the same set of individual substances\n(In Metaph., book V, tr. 2, chap. 3, fol. 185rb).\n\nMaterial distinction is a necessary and sufficient criterion for real\ndifference, traditionally conceived, whereas there is formal\ndistinction if and only if there is one substance in number (i.e.\nmaterial identity in the strict sense) and a multiplicity of formal\nprinciples with different descriptions instantiated by it. Paul\ntherefore inverts the terms of the question in relation to what\nearlier approaches had done. By means of the formal distinction Duns\nScotus and John Wyclif had tried to explain how it is possible to\ndistinguish many different real aspects internal to the same\nindividual substance (the passage is from one to many). On the\ncontrary, Paul is attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the\npassage is from many to one). What Paul wants to account for is the\nway in which many different entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an\nincomplete and dependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the\nsame substance in number.\n2.2 Predication\n\nThe starting point of Paul\u2019s theory of predication is his\ndoctrine of universals. Just like Wyclif and his followers (Alyngton,\nPenbygull, Sharpe, Milverley, Whelpdale, Tarteys), the Augustinian\nmaster claims that\n\nThere are real universals, which are common essences naturally apt\nto be present in and predicated of many similar individuals.\nReal universals and their individuals are really the same and only\nformally distinct.\nPredication is first of all a real relation between metaphysical\nentities (QdU, fols. 124ra, 124vb, 127va, 132va).\n\n\nBut his analysis of predication is different from those of both Wyclif\nand his followers. In fact, Paul divides predication into identical\npredication and formal predication and defines them in a different way\nthan his sources do.\n\nTo speak of identical predication it is sufficient that the\nform signified by the subject-term of a (true) proposition and the\nform signified by the predicate-term share at least one of their\nsubstrates of existence. This is the case for propositions like\n\u2018Man is (an) animal\u2019 and \u2018The universal-man is\nsomething white\u2019 (\u2018Homo in communi est\nalbum\u2019). One speaks of formal predication in two\ncases:\n\nWhen for the truth of the proposition it is necessary that the\nform signified by the predicate-term is present in all the\nsubstrates of existence of the form signified by the subject-term, in\nvirtue of a formal principle (made clear in the proposition itself)\nthat is in turn directly present in all the substrates of existence of\nthe form signified by the subject-term. This is the case for\npropositions like \u2018Man is formally (an) animal\u2019 and\n\u2018Socrates qua man is an animal\u2019.\nOr else when the predicate of the proposition is a term of second\nintention, like \u2018species\u2019 or \u2018genus\u2019. This is\nthe case for propositions like \u2018Man is a species\u2019 and\n\u2018Animal is a genus\u2019 (SN, part VI, chap. 2, fol.\n93vab; QdU, fols. 124vb\u2013125rb).\n\n\nAs is evident, identical predication is extensionally defined, whereas\nformal predication is intensionally defined, since formal predication\nentails a relation modally determined between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing. In fact, formal predication presupposes that\nthere is a necessary connection between the subject-thing and\nthe predicate-thing of the given proposition. For this reason, Paul\ndenies that sentences like \u2018(What is) singular is (what is)\nuniversal\u2019 (\u2018Singulare est universale\u2019),\nwhich Wyclif and his followers acknowledged as true, are in fact true\npropositions. For Wyclif and his followers, the sentence at issue is\nan example of predication by essence. But for Paul of Venice, it is an\nexample of formal predication; no individual qua individual\nis a universal, or vice versa, as no second intention\nintensionally considered is any other second intention (QdU,\nfol. 133va; In Porph., prooem., fol. 3ra\u2013b).\nAs a consequence, Paul rewrites the preceding sentence in this form:\n\u2018(What is) singular is this universal\u2019\n(\u2018Singulare est hoc universale\u2019), where the\npresence of the demonstrative \u2018this\u2019 changes the kind of\npredication from formal to identical. So corrected, the sentence is\ntrue, since it signifies that a certain entity, in itself singular, is\nthe substrate of existence of a universal essence (QdU, fol.\n133va\u2013b).\n\nAs a result, Paul builds up a mixed system, where the copula of the\nstandard philosophical sentences he deals with can have a threefold\nvalue: it means a partial identity between the subject-thing and the\npredicate-thing in the case of identical predication; it means a\nnecessary link between forms in the case of the first type of formal\npredication; it means that the subject-thing in virtue of itself is\nnecessarily a member of a given class of objects, which the\npredicate-term of the proposition labels and refers to, in the case of\nthe second type of formal predication\u2014that is, when the\npredicate is a term of second intention.\n3. Semantics: The Meaning and Truth of Propositions\n\nPaul of Venice deals with the problem of the meaning and truth of\nsentences in his Logica Magna and in his commentaries on the\nMetaphysics and on the Categories. His theory is\nsubstantially the same in all these works, but in the two commentaries\nhe stresses the ontological implications of his semantic choices\nslightly more, and modifies his solution of the question of the\nmeaning of a true negative sentence. Paul\u2019s purpose is twofold.\nHe intends (1) to determine the ontological status and nature of the\ncomplexe significabile more precisely; and (2) to develop a\ngeneral theory of the proposition which would be logically more\nrigorous and less compromised by a metaphysics of the possible than\nthat supported by Gregory of Rimini, his main source on that subject.\nFor this reason Paul deals with the question of the truth and falsity\nof a proposition before examining the problem of its meaning, and\nsolves the latter on the basis of the answer to the former, thus\ninverting the order followed by Gregory.\n\nAs a sign of special respect, Gregory of Rimini is the only author\ncited by name in the two treatises of Paul\u2019s Logica\nMagna devoted to the questions of the meaning and truth of a\nsentence. Paul\u2019s critique is nevertheless all-embracing. He\nlists thirteen arguments against Gregory\u2019s theses: six are\nphilosophical and seven theological (LM, II, tr. 11, pp.\n96\u2013104). We can focus on the most important ones, as they help\nus to better understand Paul\u2019s final choices on the matter.\n\nThe main philosophical arguments concern Gregory\u2019s theory of the\nlevels of being. As is well known, the aim of Gregory\u2019s theory\nof complexe significabile seems to be to identify and\ndescribe an objective and independent molecular entity existing in\nre, which can be the significatum or the referent of a\nsentence, and therefore guarantees the success of our effort to\nunderstand the world. According to Gregory, this entity is the\ncomplexe significabile, that is something (1) complex but one\nin number, which cannot be identified with the things that the subject\nand/or the predicate of the sentence signify; (2) real but distinct\nfrom the extramental categorial items as well as from their\ncorresponding mental signs; and (3) the proper and adequate object of\na possible act of signification (see the prologue of his commentary on\nthe first book of Sentences, q. 1, a. 1, pp. 3\u20134). It\nis precisely in order to provide the complexe significabile\nwith a suitable ontological status, and every sentence with a\nsignificatum that Gregory elaborates a theory of the levels of being.\nAccording to it, the world is constituted by (1) the categorial items\n(or atomic objects) which are the ground of existence of every other\nbeing; (2) the states of affairs connected to them; and (3) the\npossible states of affairs that the atomic objects could cause if they\nwere combined in a different way from the actual one. In fact, Gregory\nclaims that the terms \u2018something\u2019\n(\u2018aliquid\u2019), \u2018thing\u2019\n(\u2018res\u2019), and \u2018being\u2019\n(\u2018ens\u2019) are synonyms, and that they have a\nthreefold meaning. They can be taken (1) for anything signifiable in\nany way (that is, by a simple or a complex expression, truly or\nfalsely)\u2014this would be the sense in which Aristotle in the\nchapter de priori of his Categories says that it is\nnecessary that an expression is called true or false when a thing is\nor is not. (2) For anything signifiable by a simple or a complex\nexpression, but truly. And (3) for an existing essence or entity\n(ibidem, pp. 8\u20139). This distinction implies that (1)\nthe complexe significabilia are not real in the same sense as\nthe entia praedicamentalia are; (2) the complexe\nsignificabilia designated by false sentences have a feebler\nreality than those designated by true sentences, but they are\nnevertheless real and constitutive elements of the world; and (3) the\nreality of complexe significabilia (both true and false) is\ndifferent from that of the categorial items on which this reality is\ngrounded.\n\nPaul denies (1) that states of affairs, both actual and possible, are\nconstitutive parts of the world really distinct from the categorial\nitems, and (2) that whatever is signifiable by a complex expression is\na thing. In fact, according to Paul, the term \u2018something\u2019,\ntaken in the first or second sense enumerated by Gregory, is a\ntranscendental term, and as a consequence it immediately signifies all\npossible substances and accidents in just the same way. Therefore, if\nbeing a man (hominem esse) were something, in the first or\nsecond sense of the term \u2018something\u2019, then being a man\nwould be a substance or an accident, and so something in the third\nsense of the term\u2014that is, an atomic object (or categorial\nitem). If the supporters of Gregory\u2019s opinion were to claim that\n\u2018something\u2019 is not a transcendental term\u2014remarks\nPaul\u2014, it would follow that \u2018something\u2019 would be\neither less general than a transcendental term or more general. In the\nfirst case, the logical consequence is that the term\n\u2018something\u2019 signifies a categorial item, and thus it still\nfollows that if being a man is something in the first or second way,\nit is something in the third way. In the second case, it follows that\n\u2018something\u2019 is more general than \u2018being\u2019, and\ntherefore that the following inference is invalid:\n\n\n\u00abif being a man is something, then being a man is\u00bb,\n\n\na consequence which is the opposite of what Gregory intended to hold\n(LM, II, tr. 11, pp. 96\u201398).\n\nThe second main philosophical argument against Gregory\u2019s theory\nis meant to show that what is signified by a sentence (or complex\nexpression) cannot be qualified as a thing. Paul explicitly denies\nthat, according to Aristotle, whatever is signifiable by a complex is\na thing (ibidem, p. 104).\n\nFrom a theological point of view, the main inconvenience arising from\nGregory\u2019s opinion is that there would be many eternal things\nnone of which is God\u2014a thesis condemned at Paris in 1277. In\nfact\u2014argues Paul\u2014this complexe significabile,\nthat God is, is a thing different from God Himself, according to\nGregory, and it is from eternity (ibidem, p. 100).\n\nIn sum, Paul agrees with Gregory that what is signified by a simple\nexpression is different from what is signified by a complex\nexpression, and that what is signified by a complex expression is also\nreal, but disagrees with him about the meaning of the term\n\u2018res\u2019. In his view, only positive beings are\nthings, and what is signified by a complex expression is not a\npositive being, as it is not an item in one of the ten categorial\nlines. In other words, according to Paul, even though states of\naffairs are not really, but only formally, different from individual\nthings, they cannot in any way be regarded as things in the world.\n\nAs a consequence, the chief feature of Paul\u2019s theory of the\ncomplexe significabile is his claim that the adequate\nsignificate of a proposition is really identical-to and somehow (and\nmore precisely, formally) distinct-from what is signifiable by the\nsubject-term and/or the predicate-term alone (ibidem, p.\n156). All the other theses derive from this, which is the cornerstone\nof his theory of the proposition.\n\nPaul defines the propositio as a well formed (congrua) and\ncomplete (perfecta) mental sentence, which signifies the true\nor the false (LM, pars II, tractatus de\npropositione, fol. 101rb\u2013va), and sums up his position on\nthe problem of truth and falsity in four points:\n\nif the adequate significate of a proposition is true and it is not\ninconsistent that the proposition, thus adequately signifying, should\nbe true, then the proposition is true;\nif a proposition, adequately signifying that things are in some\nway, is true, then its adequate significate is true;\nif the adequate significate of a proposition is false, then the\nproposition is false;\nif a proposition is false, and it is not inconsistent that its\nadequate significate is false, then its adequate significate is false\n(LM, II, tr. 10, p. 62).\n\n\nThe obvious consequence of these rules is that, with the sole\nexception of insolubilia, which are called false not because\nthey signify the false, but because they affirm themselves to be false\nor not to be true, all the other kinds of proposition are true if and\nonly if what they signify is true, and false if and only if what they\nsignify is false (ibidem, p. 64).\n\nIn his commentary on the Categories, Paul explains that the\ndirect and adequate objects of propositions, which make them true, are\nmolecular things (res complexae) existing outside the soul.\nSuch entities are complexe significabilia, the\nsignificata of propositions, that is extramental realities\nmade up of a subject-form and a predicate-form linked together in one\nand the same substance or set of substances (In Cat., cap.\nde subiecto et praedicato, fol. 48ra). Thus, Paul\u2019s\napproach to the question of the truth of a proposition is ontological,\nas is Gregory\u2019s, since according to him the true is an attribute\nof things and only secondarily of thought, but at the same time it is\nconsistent with the fundamental principle of every form of\ncorrespondence theory of truth, that of the isomorphism of language,\nthought, and the world. In fact, in his commentary on the\nMetaphysics Paul distinguishes three different but connected\nkinds of truth: truth of imitation (veritas imitationis),\ntruth of disclosure (veritas manifestationis), and relational\ntruth (veritas respectiva). The first type of truth is the\nmeasure of the conformity (adaequatio) which all the things\nhave in relation to their corresponding ideas in the mind of God, from\nwhich they derive. The second type is also a real property of\nextramental things, which measures their various degrees of\ndisposition to be apprehended by our intellect. Relational truth,\nunlike the first two veritates, is not an absolute property\nof things, but, just as its name suggests, a relation, and more\nprecisely a relation of conformity which has its substrate of\nexistence in our intellect, its fundamentum in mental\nsentences, and its terminus ad quem in the molecular objects\nexisting outside the soul. Despite the fact that it is related to the\nactivity of the intellect, the veritas respectiva is the\neffect caused in our intellect by the existence of the veritas\nmanifestationis. If things were not intelligible by themselves,\nthey could not be grasped and recognised by our intellect for what\nthey are (In Metaph., lib. VI, cap. 4, fol. 233rb\u2013va).\nSo, like Gregory, Paul also supports the idea that human knowledge is\ntrue only qua knowledge of the ontological truth, and that\nsentences are true only in so far as they are signs of the ontological\ntruth.\n\nOn the basis of this account, what then is the relationship that holds\nbetween atomic objects (the incomplexa or categorial items)\nand molecular objects (or complexa or complexe\nsignificabilia)? And what is (if anything is) the significate of\na false proposition? Paul answers these questions in the Logica\nMagna and in the commentary on the Categories. His\nconception undergoes a certain development: in the Logica\nMagna he denies that what is signified by a true negative\nproposition is something real, since it is neither an atomic being,\nnor an aggregate, nor a molecular being (II, tr. 11, p. 122). In the\ncommentary on the Categories he modifies his opinion on this\nsubject, since he admits that there are in re a kind of\nnegative state of affairs signified by true negative propositions.\nMoreover, he now identifies the significate of any false sentence with\na second mental proposition existing obiective and not\nsubiective in our intellect.\n\nThe thesis of the Logica Magna that what is signified by a\ntrue negative proposition is not something real was not consistent\nwith the universal principle adopted by Paul in this context: a\nsentence is true if and only if it is a signum veri, nor with\nwhat he affirms about the reality of what is signified by a true\naffirmative sentence, which he identifies with the molecular truth\nwhich derives from the veritas manifestationis proper to the\natomic beings, and which is at the same time really identical-with and\nformally distinct-from them (ibidem, pp. 156 and 166).\n\nIt is clear that if he was not also able to give a form of reality to\nthe significata of true negative sentences, they could not be\nconsidered true, but, paradoxically, would be false, because they\nwould be without any referent in reality. For this reason in the\ncommentary on the Categories Paul distinguishes between the\nsignificate of a true sentence and the significate of a false\nsentence. Paul persists in thinking that if there is no adequate\nsignificatum in the world, that is, if there is not something\ncomplex to which the mental proposition refers in extramental reality,\nthen the uttered sentence and the mental proposition are false, but he\nnow accepts Burley\u2019s idea that there are two different kinds of\nmental expressions, those which exist subiective in the\nintellect, as its acts of understanding, and those which exist\nobiective in it, as the direct objects of those acts of\nunderstanding. According to Paul, the mental proposition existing\nobiective in our intellect is the significatum ultimum et\nadaequatum of false propositions (In Cat., cap. de\npriori, fol. 136vb).\n\nAs far as true propositions, both affirmative and negative, are\nconcerned, the case is different. In Paul\u2019s opinion, a true\naffirmative proposition signifies a molecular truth, that is a complex\nreality which is part of the whole reality (the esse reale of\nthe Summa philosophiae naturalis\u2014see below) of a finite\ncorporeal being. So, like Gregory, Paul denies that what verifies the\nproposition \u2018Socrates is white\u2019 is Socrates and the\naccidental form of whiteness taken together. On the contrary, he\nclaims that the significatum adaequatum of that proposition\nis the whole reality of Socrates or his being white (LM, II,\ntr. 11, p. 170). In fact, if the realities signified by true\npropositions were aggregates made up of the two entities signified by\nthe subject-term and the predicate-term, then these two propositions,\n\u2018the sun heats the house\u2019 and \u2018the house is heated\nby the sun\u2019, would be interchangeable not only with respect to\ntheir reference, but also wth respect to their significates, because\nwhat verifies both of them would be the existence of the sun, the\nhouse, and the action of heating. But according to Paul, the two\npropositions are only extensionally equivalent, and intensionally\ndifferent, because of their own different significata\n(ibidem). \u2018The sun heats the house\u2019 signifies a\nstate (of affairs) connected with the being of the sun, but \u2018the\nhouse is heated by the sun\u2019 signifies a state (of affairs)\nconnected with the being of the house. Thus it is incorrect that,\naccording to Paul, the significate with which the adequate significate\nof a proposition can be in fact identified is the one thing that, by\nbeing in a certain state, renders the proposition true. It is quite\nthe opposite: a certain state of the thing signified by the subject of\nthe sentence is the adequate significate of that same sentence. Paul\nmaintains (1) that the adequate significate of a proposition is,\nimplicitly or explicitly, determined by the composition of its parts,\nand (2) that it is impossible for the adequate significate of a simple\nexpression (a term) to be the adequate significate of a complex\nexpression (a proposition), since otherwise, an absolutely simple term\nwould adequately signify the true or the false\u2014an evident\nabsurdity (LM, II, tr. 11, p. 196). So, in order to be\nconsistent with these claims, in the commentary on the\nCategories Paul states that true negative propositions too\nhave something complex which corresponds to them in reality, a sort of\nnegative state of affairs grounded (1) in the two esse realia\nproper to the things signified by the subject and predicate-terms, or\n(2) in the laws which rule the order and the metaphysical structure of\nthe world (In Cat., cap. de substantia, fol.\n66ra).\n4. Ontology\n\nPaul\u2019s world consists of finite beings (that is, things like men\nor horses) really existing outside the mind, each made up of a primary\nsubstance and a host of forms existing in it and by it. The forms of a\nprimary substance belong to ten different types of being, or\ncategories. Therefore a finite being cannot be totally identified with\nthe primary substance. (In fact no primary substance contains the\nwhole being of a finite being.) Rather it is an ordered congeries of\ncategorial items. Primary substances are not simple items but complex\nobjects, since they are compounded of particular matter and\nform\u2014a form that is really identical with and formally distinct\nfrom the specific nature itself that the primary substance\ninstantiates (SN, part VI, chap. 1, fols. 92vb\u201393ra).\nThe concepts of matter and form are relative, since their meanings are\nconnected with each other (In Post., fol. 40rb). Being the\nform of something and being the matter of something are converse\nrelations of three different kinds, whose arguments and values\nare:\n\nthe metaphysical constituents of the individual substance (i.e.\nsingular matter and form);\nthe metaphysical constituents of the specific natures (i.e. genus\nand difference); and\nthe categorial items (i.e. individual and universal substances and\naccidents) considered according to their various degrees of\ngenerality.\n\n\nThe specific nature (or essence) can be conceived from a twofold point\nof view: intensionally (in abstracto) and extensionally\n(in concreto). Intensionally viewed, the specific nature\nsimply expresses the set of essential properties that compose a\ncategorial form, without any reference to the existence of individuals\nwhich, if there are any, instantiate it. Extensionally viewed, the\nspecific nature is that same form conceived of as instantiated by at\nleast one singular entity. For instance, human nature intensionally\nconsidered is humanity (humanitas); extensionally it is man\n(homo) (In Porph., prooem., fol. 9va). Both\nof them are substantial forms superordinated to the whole human\ncompound, but while humanity is properly a form, i.e. something\nexistentially incomplete and dependent, man is an existentially\nautonomous and independent entity. Thus they differ from each other in\nthe same way as a predicate (for example \u2018P\u2019)\ndiffers from a formula (for example,\n\u2018P(x)\u2019).\n\nBecause of the complexity of the metaphysical composition of the\nfinite corporeal being, every creature has four different levels of\nbeing: real, essential, temporal, and individual. Real being is\nnothing but the whole reality of the finite being. Essential being is\nthe mode of being proper to the specific nature that a certain\nsingular directly instantiates. Temporal being is the state of affairs\ndesignated by infinitival expressions like \u2018being a man\u2019\n(\u2018hominem esse\u2019) or \u2018being white\u2019\n(\u2018esse album\u2019)\u2014that is, the object of the\nact of judging. Finally, individual being is the actual existence of\nthe primary substance of a finite being as distinct from the whole\nreality of the finite being itself (SN, part VI, chap. 1,\nfol. 92vb).\n\nPaul asserts the following relationships among these four levels of\nbeing and the essence of a creature: the essence and being of any\ncreature are not really distinct from each other; the essence of a\nthing is formally different from its real being and from its essential\nbeing; the essence and the essential being of a thing are formally\n(ratione) different from temporal and individual beings;\nspecific and generic essences can keep on being even though no\nindividual instantiates them, but in this case they do not have any\nactual existence (esse actuale). From that point of view,\nSocrates being a man (Sortem esse hominem) is in reality\nSocrates himself considered together with all the properties of which\nhe is the bearer. On the other hand, the proposition identifies only\none of these properties, that signified by the predicate-term (in our\nexample the property of being a man), which is formally different from\nthe form (in our example that of humanity) connoted by the\npredicate-term itself (ibidem, fols. 92vb\u201393ra).\n\nAccording to Paul, who follows Duns Scotus and Wyclif on this subject,\nbeing is univocally shared by everything real, since it is the stuff\nthat the ten categories modulate according to their own essence\n(In Phys., book I, tr. 1, chap. 2, t. c. 13; In\nMetaph., book IV, tr. 1, chap. 1, fols. 122ra\u2013125vb,\npassim; In Porph., chap. De specie, fol.\n22rb). In view of this position, Paul maintains no real distinction\nbetween essence and being (In Metaph., book IV, tr. 1, chap.\n2, fol. 127rb; book VI, chap. 1, fol. 223vb). Like Duns Scotus and\nWyclif, Paul speaks of a formal difference (or difference of reason)\nbetween essence and being in creatures, as the essence and the\nessential being of a thing are one and the same entity considered from\ntwo distinct points of view, intensionally (the essence) and\nextensionally (the being) (SN, part VI, chap. 1, fol.\n93ra).\n\nThis analysis identifies the opposition between essence and being with\nthe opposition between universals and individuals. Like Wyclif, Paul\nthinks of essence as a universal form intensionally considered, and\nexistence (taken in the strict sense) as the mode of being proper to\nprimary substances. Thus, when Paul affirms that essence and being are\nreally identical and formally different, he simply restates the thesis\nof the real identity and formal distinction between universals and\nindividuals that was typical of the Realists of the late Middle Ages.\nConsequently, like Burley and Wyclif, Paul holds that a formal\nuniversal actually (in actu) exists outside our minds only if\nthere is at least one individual that instantiates it, so that without\nindividuals common natures (or essences) are not really universals\n(SN, part VI, chap. 2, fol. 94ra).\n\nThis means that the relationship between common natures and singulars\nis ultimately grounded on individuation, since no actual universality\nand no instantiation is possible without individuation. On this\nsubject Paul successfully reconciles the Scotistic approach with\ncertain Thomistic theses. Paul claims that the principle of\nindividuation is twofold, immanent and remote. The immanent principle\nis the one whose presence necessarily entails the existence of the\nindividual it constitutes, and whose absence necessarily entails the\nnon-existence (or disappearance) of the individual. The remote\nprinciple, on the other hand, is just what the immanent principle\npresupposes, but whose presence and absence alone are insufficient for\ncausing the existence or disappearance of the individual, as it\ncontinues being after the corruption of the individual. Thisness\n(haecceitas) is the immanent principle of individuation,\nwhereas form, matter, and quantity are the remote principle. Thisness\nin turn has a twofold origin, as it derives from matter and form\ntogether in the case of corporeal substances, and as it derives from\nthe essence (quidditas) alone in the case of angelic\nintelligences (SN, part VI, chap. 5, fol. 95vb). Furthermore,\naccording to Paul there is a close similarity between the thisness,\nwhich he now calls individual difference (differentia\nindividualis), and the specific difference. The specific\ndifference is what differentiates the species from the genus, since it\nis the determination or property which, once added to the genus,\nresults in the species. On the other hand, the specific difference is\nreally identical with the genus, from which it is distinct only in\nvirtue of a formal principle. The same happens to the individual\ndifference: it is what differentiates the individual from the species;\nfrom the ontological point of view, it is really identical with and\nformally distinct from the species itself; and it is the formal\nprinciple in virtue of which the individual is what it is, something\nparticular, concrete, and perfectly determined in itself (SN,\npart VI, chap. 5, fol. 96rb; chap. 26, fol. 112rb\u2013va;\nQdU, fol. 128va; fol. 129rb; In Metaph., book III,\ntr. 1, chap. 1, fol. 83vb).\n\nAs far as the problem of angelic individuation is concerned, the\nlogical consequence deriving from such premisses is that it is\nimpossible to find two angels who share the same specific nature and\nare numerically distinct, since only one haecceitas can\nspring up from an incorporeal species (SN, part VI, chap. 5,\nfol. 96ra). This solution is close to the inner meaning of Duns\nScotus\u2019 position and contrasts with Aquinas\u2019 view,\nalthough Paul affirms that the angelic intelligences are specifically,\nand not numerically, different. In fact, according to St. Thomas,\nangels are specifically different because they are incorporeal, and\nwithout matter no individuation is possible. On the contrary, Paul of\nVenice thinks angels are individuated by means of thisnesses, but not\nmultiplied by them, because of the absence of matter, so that there is\nonly one angel per species. Since specific natures of incorporeal\nbeings do not include any reference to matter, only a unique principle\nof individuation (ratio suppositalis) can flow from such\nspecies. As a consequence, no angel is one in number in the strict\nsense of the term (as being one in number necessarily implies the\nactual presence of a multiplicity of things of the same species), even\nthough broadly speaking every angel is one in number, as two (or more)\nangels are, after all, \u201cmany things\u201d\u2014but never many\nangels of the same kind (SN, part VI, chap. 5, fol.\n95vb).\n\nIn his last work, the commentary on the Ars Vetus, Paul\nsummarizes his position as follows:\n\nThe individual is the final result of a process of individuation\nwhose starting point is a specific form.\nThe individuation is what differentiates the individual from its\nspecies.\nThe individuation is nothing but the thisness itself.\nThe thisness and the specific form are only formally distinct from\nthe individual they make up (In Porph., chap. De\nspecie, fol. 60ra).\nThe principle of individuation, when causing the passage from the\nlevel of universals to that of singulars, does not play the role of\nform (or act) in relation to the specific nature, but the role of\nmatter (or potency), as it is what the specific form structures\n(In Cat., chap. De substantia, fol. 60ra).\n\n\nIn this way Paul of Venice tried to solve the aporetic aspects of Duns\nScotus\u2019 theory of individuation. Scotus said nothing about the\nproblem of the relation between the thisness and the particular matter\nand form that constitute the individual. The Franciscan master was\nalso silent about a possible identification of the thisness with one\nof the two essential forms of the individual substance, the forma\npartis (for instance, the individual soul) and the forma\ntotius (the human nature). Paul identifies the principle of\nindividuation with the informing act through which the specific nature\nmolds its matter. This identification had been already suggested by\nthe opposition between immanent and remote principles of individuation\ndescribed in the Summa philosophiae naturalis. In fact, all\nthe constituents of the individual compound (matter, form, and\nquantity) had been contrasted with the thisness, which for that reason\ncould not be identified with any of them. Moreover, it is obvious\nthat:\n\nIt is the union of the singular form with its matter that\nestablishes the \u201cbirth\u201d of the individual.\nIt is its separation from the matter that establishes the\n\u201cdeath\u201d of the individual.\nThe union of the singular form with its matter is the necessary\nand sufficient condition for the passage of the specific essence from\nits abstract (or intensional) mode of being to its concrete (or\nextensional) mode of being.\n\n5. The Body-soul Problem and the Theory of Knowledge\n\nAccording to the standard medieval realist theories of knowledge, as\nexemplified by Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, the primary object of\nthe human intellect is the essence of material things. Such essences\nbecome intelligible to us only when our intellect has abstracted them\nfrom the individualising properties connected with the matter, so that\nwe can have direct knowledge of universals only. Yet, an intellective\nknowledge of individuals is possible, if the intellect, after\nabstracting the intelligible species through which it grasps essences,\nturns its attention to the phantasm from which it has drawn the\nintelligible species itself. This action, the conversion to phantasm,\nproduces a reflexive (that is, indirect) and incomplete knowledge of\nthe individual thing represented by the phantasm itself. On the other\nhand, according to the standard medieval nominalist theories of\nknowledge, as exemplified by Ockham, individuals alone are the object\nof our intellect, and the main form of human cognition is not the\nabstractive one, but intuitive cognition, which properly concerns the\nexistence and non-existence of individual things, as it is that\nimmediate apprehension of a thing (that is, an individual substance or\nquality) as existent which enables us to form a contingent proposition\nconcerning the existence of that same thing. By contrast, abstractive\nknowledge is an apprehension of terms by which it is impossible for us\nto have evidence of whether or not a certain thing exists. Thus,\nintuitive and abstractive cognition attain the same singular objects,\nbut in different ways, since abstractive cognition is indifferent to\nexistence and produces a universal sign of a multiplicity of\nsingulars.\n\nThese different epistemological explanations depend also on\ndifferences in ontology. According to medieval Realists, individuals\ncannot be the proper (not even a proper) and adequate object of\nknowledge for any intellect, since (1) their world includes common\nnatures or essences besides individual things; (2) individuals stem\nfrom species by means of prime matter (plus quantity); and (3) prime\nmatter is per se something opaque and unintelligible. Apart from the\nunsuitable theological consequences (how is it possible that God knows\nhuman beings perfectly, if every kind of individual is per se\nsomething not completely intelligible?), the realist account entails a\nparadox, as the phantasm already enables us to grasp the substance and\nthe accidental properties of an individual thing far before the\nconversion to itself which follows intellective cognition, because it\nis an appropriate image (or representation) of the particular material\nobject perceived by the senses. On the other hand, the punctum dolens\nof any nominalist description of the process of knowledge lies in the\ndifficulty in explaining the nature and origin of abstractive\ncognition and the relation which holds between the universal sign and\nthe individuals which it refers to\u2014how can they constitute a\nnatural set? How can we know under a universal form (universaliter)\nsomething which is in itself absolutely singular?\n\nIt is just in order to do away with the peculiar problems of the\nrealist paradigm that Paul of Venice worked out a new version of the\nstandard medieval realist theories of knowledge, critical of the most\ncommon solutions proper to his intellectual environment, and where\nmuch more stress is put on the question of class-membership, and on\nthe intellective cognition of individuals.\n\nAs to the problem of the relation of soul to body, Paul rejects the\nAugustinian conception and follows the Aristotelian view of the soul\nas form of the body, so that in his opinion the subject of knowledge\nis not the soul alone, but the whole human composite. Not even\nsensation can be attributed simply to the soul using a body, as\nAugustine had thought. Moreover, against Aristotle and following\nAquinas, Paul claims that, although it is the form of the body, the\nhuman soul is a self-subsistent form, and therefore incorruptible.\nHowever, unlike Aquinas, he maintains that the human soul is two-fold,\nas the complete human soul (anima totalis) derives from the close\nunion of two distinct principles, the cogitative and the intellective.\nThis fact does not break the unity of the human soul nor of the human\ncomposite, since (1) the cogitative principle is the cause of the\nanimality and the intellective one of the rationality of man; (2)\nneither of them can exist in man without the other; and (3) the\ncogitative soul is in potency in relation to the intellective one\n(Summa philosophiae naturalis, ed. Venetiis 1503 [=\nSN], pars v, ch. 5, fols. 68vb and 69ra; see also\nScriptum super libros De anima ed. Venetiis 1504 [= In De\nan.], II, t.c. 23, fols. 47rb-48ra).\n\nLike Thomas Aquinas and Giles of Rome, Paul maintains that there is a\nreal distinction between the soul and its faculties, but, in\nopposition to them, he holds that there is only a formal distinction\n(ratione et definitione) between the faculties themselves\n(SN, p. v, ch. 4, fol. 68ra-b). Whereas the faculties of the\ncogitative soul depend on bodily organs for their operations, the\nfaculties of the intellective soul, i.e. the active intellect, the\npassive intellect, and the will, are independent, even though in the\nstate of union with the body they need sensation for exercising their\npowers, and no act of sensation can be produced without the\nconcurrence of the body (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fols. 71va-72ra.).\nBesides the vegetative faculty (which regulates nutrition, growth, and\nreproduction) and the power of locomotion, the faculties of the\ncogitative soul are the following: the five exterior senses, the\ngeneral sense (sensus communis), the fantasy\n(phantasia), the vis aestimativa (or\ncogitativa properly so called), and the memory. Against\nAvicenna, Paul explicitly denies that there is a fifth internal sense,\nthe imagination, since he thinks that its presumed operations are the\nsame as those of the fantasy (SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol. 84ra).\nThe general sense distinguishes and collates the data of the special\nexterior senses. The fantasy conserves the species apprehended by\nsenses and freely combines them together to produce figments. The\ncogitativa recognizes those properties of things which cannot\nbe perceived through the senses, like, for example, that something is\nuseful for a certain purpose, or friendly, or unfriendly. The memory\nis the \u2018warehouse\u2019 where all the species are stored, so\nthat the cogitative soul can perform its tasks even without the\npresence of any material object (see SN, p. v, ch. 30, fol.\n84ra-va).\n\nAccording to Paul, the qualities which are the adequate and per se\nobject of the exterior senses cause a peculiar modification in the\nbodily organs, that is the presence in them of a forma\nintentionalis or species sensibilis, which does not\nimply any material mutation in the organ itself, as such a form is a\nresembling image (similitudo) of the real form which started\nthe process totally lacking extension, and therefore unable to modify\nin any way the matter of the bodily organs (cf. SN, p. v, ch.\n23, fol. 79va, and ch. 30, fol. 84rb). As a consequence, Paul affirms\nthat the species sensibilis is a pure form without matter in\na two-fold sense: it is not grounded on matter, and it has no\nextension. Yet, as a resembling image of a real form it contains in\nitself a sort of logical description of the matter to which the real\nform gives structure (see SN, p. v, ch. 23, fol. 79 vb). When the\nspecies meets the potentia sensitiva of the bodily organ, a\nsensation is produced, by means of which the soul becomes aware of the\nexternal existence of a certain reality (SN, p. v, ch. 28,\nfol. 83ra). This process is totally passive, as exterior senses can\ngive birth to sensations only in virtue of the actual presence of the\nmaterial object (SN, p. v, ch. 10, fol. 71va-b). The\nspecies sensibilis present in one of the exterior senses and\nthe species sensibilis present in the sensus\ncommunis (and in the other internal senses), differ specifically\n(specifice) from each other, since they are images of objects\nof different types. In fact, the species present in the general sense\nis a species of species, as it is not the logical image of the\nexternal quality which caused the process of sensation, but an image\nof the species present in the exterior sense (SN, p. v, ch.\n28, fol. 83ra). The higher level of sense-knowledge is therefore\nqualitatively distinct from the lower. At the higher level, every\npassage from a faculty to another entails a sort of purification of\nthe forma intentionalis, which progressively loses the\ninformation on the individual characteristics of the external object\n(SN, p. v, ch. 40, fol. 90va). So the perceived thing is\nfirst apprehended by the cogitativa as this singular bearer\nof certain properties, then as a bearer of certain properties, a\nchange that Paul qualifies as a transition from the condition of\nintentio singularis signata to the condition of intentio\nsingularis vaga (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb).\nNot only does the cogitativa effect the transformation of the\nintentio singularis signata into an intentio singularis\nvaga, it also abstracts the substance, which is a sensibile\nper accidens (something accidentally perceptible) from the\nperceived accidental properties which are sensibilia per se\n(perceptible by themselves\u2014In De an., III, t.c. 11,\nfol. 137rb; see also SN, p. v, ch. 11, fol. 72ra).\n\nAs we have already seen, in Nicoletti\u2019s view the phantasm is a\nrepresentation of the thing which started the process of knowing.\nAltough immaterial and free from any reference to the individualising\nproperties (of the thing at issue), the phantasm is not completely\nintelligible, since the intentio singularis vaga still\ncontains a sort of logical description of the generic matter which the\nsingular thing is made of, and through it to the general conditions\nfor individuation. For example, when we apprehend Socrates as a man,\nwe know human essence just as instantiated by a singular item, and not\nin itself, as a specific type. In order to have the concept of man,\nthere is need of a further and higher activity on the part of the\nsoul, which has to abstract from the phantasm the universal or\nintelligible species, which applies to all men. This further activity\nis the proper action of the active intellect, which illumines both the\nphantasm and the possible intellect, so impressing on the latter the\nspecies intelligibilis abstracted from the former (In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb).\n\nAs for the possible (or passive) intellect, according to Nardi,\nRuello, and Kuksewicz, Paul was an Averroist, as he would have\nsupported the thesis of the unicity and separate character of such an\nintellect for the whole human species. But this is false. On the\ncontrary, Paul\u2019s point of view for this question is close to\nthat of Thomas Aquinas, whose arguments against the unicity of the\npassive intellect he utilizes in his commentaries on the De\nanima and on the Metaphysics (after 1420). If his\naffirmations in the Summa philosophiae naturalis are a bit\nambiguous and it is therefore possible to miss their deepest meaning,\nin these two Aristotelian commentaries he clearly rejects all the main\ntheses of later medieval Averroism (see Amerini, 2012). He thinks that\n(1) the claim of the unicity of the possible intellect for the whole\nhuman species is lacking in a solid philosophical basis, since it can\nbe maintained from the physical point of view only, according to which\neverything is considered qua affected-by or connected-with motion, but\n(2) it is false from the metaphysical point of view, which is the most\ncomprehensive of all. From this viewpoint, according to which the\npossible intellect has to be considered a substantial form (and more\nprecisely, the form of the human body), it is evident that it has a\nbeginning in time, but certainly not an end, and that, like any other\nmaterial substantial form, it is multiplied according to the\nmultiplication of bodies, since one and the same principle in number\ncannot be the form of a multiplicity of substances. Furthermore, given\nthat different men can form different opinions about the same thing or\nevent, one and the same intellect could hold contradictory views at\nonce, in apparent violation of the law of contradiction (see In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 149ra).\n\nIn the SN Paul had spoken of the active intellect in terms of\na separated substance. The active intellect is connected to the\npossible intellect and the human soul by inherence and to the phantasm\nas the phantasm is directly present before it (cf. SN, p. v,\nch. 38, fol. 89ra). On the contrary, in the commentary on the De\nanima, he (1) identifies the active intellect with God Himself,\nconsidered as the first cause, and its own activity with God\u2019s\nactivity of illumination in and outside the soul, and (2) affirms that\nthe active intellect is joined to the possible intellect neither by\ninherence nor by information, but as a form directly present in it\n(In De an., III, t.c. 19, fol. 143ra). This fact explains why\nthe first of the four main effects produced by the active intellect is\nset in the external world, and the fourth one both in the external\nworld and in the human mind. In turn, the mutual connections and\ndistinctive features of the actions performed by the active intellect\nexplain why (1) individuals are proper objects of intellection for us;\n(2) the intelligible species is singular and not universal; and (3)\nthe same intelligible species by means of which we grasp substantial\nessences is the medium in virtue of which we can understand the\npeculiar structure of the individual which instantiates that essence\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols. 136vb and 137rb-va)\u2014all\ntheses which are just the opposite of the most common realist\nconvictions on the matter, as Paul himself points out (In De\nan., III, t.c. 27, fol. 137va).\n\nAs a consequence, he explicitly polemicizes with Giles of Rome and\nThomas Aquinas on the problem of the cognition of individuals. He sums\nup their position in four theses, accepts the first one, and argues\nagainst the last three. The four theses are the following:\n\nthe primary object of our intellect is the quidditas\nrei;\nthe first intelligible species produced in our intellect is\nuniversal (that is, it enables us to know a common item) and\nabstract;\nsingulars are known only after the intellection of the\nuniversal;\nsingulars are not directly known by our intellect, but indirectly\nby reflection (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 136vb).\n\n\nAs far as the second thesis is concerned, Paul thinks that the first\nintelligible species present in our mind is about a singular item and\nenables us to know it, as the first intelligible species is drawn from\nthe phantasm, which is formally and per se the mental representation\nof an individual item, and therefore singular itself (phantasma\nest intentio singularis). The third and fourth theses are\nquestioned together. Paul raises two main objections against them. The\nfirst one runs as follows: if we can know the individual which causes\nthe process of intellection only after the cognition of the universal,\nthen something in the cognition of the universal functions as a medium\nfor this new apprehension. It cannot be the universal itself, as it is\nnot more similar to this individual than to any other; so it must be\nsomething singular, distinct from the universal and added to it. But,\nif so, then this singular is to be known per se and directly (because\nif per accidens and/or indirectly, then only in virtue of something\nelse, which in turn would become the new medium for the cognition of\nthe individual, and so on) far before the conversion to the phantasm,\nwhich is therefore totally superfluous. The second objection is even\nmore articulated. Paul observes that, if our intellect apprehends the\nsingular thing which starts the process of understanding only by means\nof the conversion to the phantasm, then the phantasm acts upon the\nintellect, impressing an image (or species) on it. If the image\nimpressed is universal, then the passive intellect cannot apprehend\nany singular thing by means of it; as a consequence, it can only be\nparticular; but in this case the phantasm performs just the same\naction as before the conversion to itself, which is therefore\nredundant. Nor can one say that the phantasm does not act upon the\npassive intellect, because in this case the conversion to it would be\neven more unnecessary, if possible, and material items would be known\nby us in the same way as God and the (angelic) intelligences, which\nare immaterial (In De an., III, t.c. 11, fols.\n136vb-137ra).\n\nAs is evident, the Italian master is aware of the paradox entailed by\nthe standard realist account of human knowledge and his theory is a\nserious attempt to avoid it. Paul refuses Aquinas\u2019s and\nGiles\u2019s views since they imply that the intellectual\napprehension of the universal essence, because of its two-fold\nrelation to the phantasm, at once presupposes the sense-apprehension\nof the individual thing (which instantiates that essence) and is\npresupposed by the intellectual apprehension of the individual thing.\nSince at the level of sense-apprehension of individual items the human\nsoul, through the cogitativa, is already able to recognize\nthe substance (of those individual things), the intellectual\napprehension cannot in any way add new information on the res\nat issue and must be totally identical with the sense-apprehension. As\na consequence, instead of elaborating an interpretative pattern of\nhuman knowledge based on the form of the spiral, where the same things\ncome back to our soul at different moments in the process of\nabstraction, Paul tacitly develops in an original way some suggestions\ndrawn from Walter Burley\u2019s prologue to his last commentary on\nthe Physics. In criticizing Averroes\u2019s thesis that the\nquidditas of material things is the primary object of our\nunderstanding and the material and individual things themselves a\nsecondary object, Paul explains our knowledge in terms of a sort of\nstraight line which proceeds from the most superficial to the deepest\nlevels of reality, and states that our intellect is equally apt to\nreceive both universal and singular species, and, as a consequence,\nthat it is apt to know both common essences and singular things\n(In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 136va-b).\n\nThis solution introduces the chief thesis of the nominalist approach\nto epistemology (the direct knowledge of individuals) into a realist\ncontext; nevertheless it is consistent with the metaphysical\npresuppositions proper to the late medieval realist way of thought.\nWith the noteworthy exception of Walter Burley, according to any late\nmedieval Realist, in the extramental world universal essences and\nindividual things come together, since they are really identical and\nonly formally distinct, although universal essence belongs to a deeper\nlevel of reality. In a certain way they are two different aspects of\nthe same thing. This fact explains what happens in the process of\nknowledge according to Paul: since the intelligible species is\ndirectly connected with the essence of a thing and indirectly, by\nmeans of the phantasm, with the singular thing itself (cf. In De\nan., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137rb), our intellect grasps the\nuniversal essence and the individual thing at the same time, so that\nboth of them are the primary objects of our mind, even though the\nuniversal essence is the primary object by nature (primitate\nnaturae \u2013 In De an., III, t.c. 11, fol. 137va; see\nalso SN, p. v, ch. 39, fol. 90va).\n6. Theology: the Doctrine of Divine Ideas\n\nPaul deals with the problem of divine ideas in his commentary on book\nVII of the Metaphysics (tr. 3, chap. 2) and at the end of the\nQuaestio de universalibus (tenth conclusion: universalia\nplatonica et idealia sunt ex natura rei in mente divina causaliter\nponenda). The cornerstone of his theory of divine exemplarism is\nthe conviction that there is a close parallelism between human\nartificers as producers of artifacts and God as a creator\u2014only\nin this way, according to Paul, can the main goal of every theory of\ndivine ideas (that is, the explanation of the rationality of creation\nas a free act of God) be achieved. Paul develops four rational pieces\nof evidence for supporting the thesis of the eternal existence in\nGod\u2019s mind of a multiplicity of ideas, conceived of as the\nformal patterns and principles (exemplaria) of creatures.\n\nThe first argument goes as follows: since the prima causa\nproduces individuals which differ in species (type) from each other\n(say men and horses), they are produced according to different formal\nprinciples, as the effects of the same principle are identical in\ntype. The second is that if A and B are two different\ncreatures (say a man and a donkey) that God is going to create, their\nmutual differences cannot be grounded on their own beings, since they\nare not yet existing things; therefore they have to be found in\nsomething pertaining to God\u2019s productive potency, which will act\naccording to different principles present in it. The third argument is\nunsound: Paul argues that since in God each generic principle\n(ratio generis) is different from any corresponding specific\nprinciple (ratio speciei), therefore specific principles too\nare different from each other. Unfortunately, the proof he makes use\nof for showing the difference in reality between generic and specific\nprinciples is inconsistent. He affirms that if the generic and\nspecific principles were not distinct, then God could not create\nsomething according to the generic principle without creating it\naccording to a correlated specific principle\u2014while this is just\nwhat happens, since no animal can be created which is not an animal of\na certain species or type (a man, or a monkey, or a mouse). The fourth\nargument is that, since God knows that animal is the genus of man and\nthat being-an-animal is included in the definition of man, He thinks\nof them by means of two different principles; otherwise He could not\ndistinguish them (QdU, fols. 133vb\u2013134ra).\n\nIn the commentary on the Metaphysics, the Italian master,\nafter denying that the ideas are self-subsistent entities, as Plato\nthought, maintains that the meaning of the term \u2018idea\u2019 is\ntwofold: (i) broadly speaking (communiter), an idea is a\nspecific essence or nature (quidditas specifica), existing in\na mind as a causal model for the production of something; (ii)\nproperly speaking (proprie), an idea is a specific essence\nexisting in God\u2019s mind as a causal model for the production of\nsomething (In Metaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va).\nFrom these definitions, which he considers consonant with the teaching\nof Aristotle and Averroes, Paul derives four consequences or theses,\nwhich, taken together, represent the very core of his theory of divine\nideas:\n\nIdeas are ideas of specific essences and not ideas of genera or of\nindividuals, because ideas are formal principles, and they are acts or\nforms in relation to any other thing; on the contrary, both genera and\nindividuals are as matter in relation to species.\nIdeas are present in the mind as in a substrate, or subject, since\nideas are the tools of the mind, and the mind can only use tools\nclosely connected with and existentially dependent on it.\nIdeas are efficient causes (causae effectivae) in\nrelation to their effects.\nIdeas are models (exemplaria) in relation to their\neffects, since their effects are similar to them. This entails that\nideas are both direct objects of knowledge (obiecta cognita\nabsolute) and that by means of which the mind knows something\nelse (obiecta cognita respective), just as the phantasm is a\ndirect object for our knowledge and that by means of which we know the\nindividual from which it has been drawn. As a consequence\u2014Paul\nadds\u2014an idea is not the notion of something (cognitio\nrei), but the essence of a thing (quidditas rei)\nconsidered according to its intelligible being in a mind (In\nMetaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298vb; see also\nQdU, fol. 134vb).\n\n\nIn sum, according to Paul, divine ideas play a threefold role in\nrelation to God and creatures: they are (i) the specific essences of\nindividual things themselves, considered according to their\nintelligible being in the mind of God; (ii) God\u2019s principles of\ncognition of creatures; and (iii) the eternal models of creatures. If\nwe also take into account that in his opinion (i) divine ideas are\nreally the same as the divine essence and formally distinct from it,\nand (ii) this distinction originates from their being efficient\n(co-)causes in relation to the different kinds of creatures, we can\neasily realize how close his position was to Wyclif\u2019s, which was\nconsidered heretical because of its consequences: metaphysical and\ntheological necessitarianism; restriction of divine omnipotence;\ndenial of the process of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. In order\nto avoid this form of necessitarianism, Paul, both in the commentary\non the Metaphysics and in the Quaestio de\nuniversalibus, maintains that in God there is an infinite number\nof ideas, some of which only have been brought into existence by Him.\nIn fact, there is a formal difference between the supreme principle of\nunderstanding of possibles, which is the divine essence itself as\ninfinitely imitable ad extra, and divine ideas, which are the\npractical principles of the production of creatures (In\nMetaph., book VII, tr. 3, chap. 2, fol. 298va; see also\nQdU, fol. 135rb). But he admits that we should conclude that\nideas in God are finite in number, if we considered the problem\nexclusively from the point of view of natural philosophy\n(ibidem).\n\nThe differences between Paul\u2019s doctrine and that of Thomas\nAquinas, his main source, on the one hand, and Wyclif\u2019s, on the\nother hand, are evident. Paul agrees with Wyclif against Thomas that\ndivine ideas are the specific essences of individual creatures,\nconsidered according to their intelligible being in the mind of God,\nand efficient (co-)causes in relation to the different kinds of\ncreatures, while he agrees with Thomas against Wyclif that there is a\ndistinction between being a mere principle of understanding\n(ratio) and being an effective model of production\n(exemplar). If Paul did not accept such a distinction, his\ntheory would be substantially the same as Wyclif\u2019s. On the\ncontrary, not only does he accept this Thomistic distinction, but he\ndevelops it in an autonomous way, which makes his admission of the\nexistence of an infinite number of ideas in God superfluous. According\nto Thomas, divine rationes and divine exemplaria are\ntwo different types of ideas, the former linked to pure speculative\nknowledge only, the latter linked to practical knowledge. Only\nexemplaria are ideas in the strict sense of the term.\nPaul\u2019s definition of divine ideas excludes that the (Thomistic)\ndivine rationes can be considered ideas, since a divine idea\nis the (i) specific nature (of a certain set of individuals) existing\nin God\u2019s mind, (ii) principle of actuality, and (iii) efficient\ncause in relation to creatures. Now, the Thomistic rationes\ndo not satisfy any of these requirements. Within Paul\u2019s system,\nwhat plays the role of the Thomistic rationes is the divine\nessence itself, which is the supreme principle of knowledge of\npossibles, but not an idea. Moreover, in Paul\u2019s view, divine\nideas are formally distinct from the divine essence. This means that,\nin principle, the divine essence and divine ideas are different\nentities. In fact, Paul\u2019s definition of formal distinction\ninverts the terms of the question in relation to the preceding\napproaches, as Paul is attempting to reduce multiplicity to unity (the\npassage is from many to one). What Paul wants to account for is the\nway in which many different entities of a certain kind (i.e. of an\nincomplete and dependent mode of existence) can constitute one and the\nsame substance. Hence, within Paul\u2019s theory of divine ideas the\ngap between the sphere of the possible and the sphere of the existent\nis deeper than in Thomas\u2019. The possible is grounded on God\nconsidered as a knower, while the existent is grounded on God\nconsidered as a maker; ideas play a role only in creation, while the\nsole divine essence is sufficient for allowing God to know possibles\n(see In Metaph., book XII, tr. 2, chap. 3, part 2, fols.\n466vb\u2013467ra).\n\nTherefore, Nicoletti\u2019s view can be summarized as follows: (i)\ndivine ideas are really identical with and formally different from the\ndivine essence; (ii) ideas are both direct, but secondary, objects of\ndivine intellection (the primary object being the divine essence\nitself) and that by means of which God knows every existent other than\nHimself; (iii) there are no ideas of individuals or of prime matter.\nPaul\u2019s position is more influenced by (Neo-)platonic\npresuppositions than that of Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas appealed to a\nsort of non-real mode of existence of divine ideas, originating from\nthe relations of imitability holding between the divine essence and\npossible creatures, so that the existence of divine ideas is purely of\nreason. Paul of Venice tries the opposite way of hypostatizing\nideas\u2014his peculiar version of the formal distinction enables him\nto do so without compromising divine simplicity. He can therefore\nclaim that the divine essence is the substrate of divine ideas, as if\nthey were a sort of accidents inhering in a substance. As a\nconsequence, the statement that the ideas are direct but secondary\nobjects of divine intellection means that God\u2019s intellection\nfirst grasps the divine essence and then ideas, even though\nGod\u2019s intuition of Himself and God\u2019s intuition of ideas\nare not distinct. In fact, divine ideas are not the specific natures\nof creatures as creatures are conceived of terminative in\nthemselves by God, but as they are conceived of subiective in\nHim, that is, by means of a different reality (the divine essence) and\naccording to their relation of ontological dependence upon the divine\nessence itself. The identity between divine ideas and the esse\nideale proper to specific natures, and the relation of\none-to-many holding between specific natures and the individuals which\noriginate from them, explain how God can know individuals\nperfectly\u2014even though mediately, through ideas. In fact,\ninfinite individual causal principles derive from one and the same\ndivine idea, formally distinct from each other. They correspond to the\nthisnesses (haecceitates), which on the level of existence\ngive rise to individuals from species. As thisnesses are the formal\nprinciples in virtue of which individuals are what they are, something\nparticular, concrete, and perfectly determined in itself, so these\nindividual causal principles deriving from ideas are what causes the\npassage from the specific ideal standard to the analytical description\nof its instantiations (QdU, fol. 135ra). Prime matter, which\nis a necessary constituent of any corporeal thing, is known by God in\nthe same way as individuals are: not in itself, but derivatively in\nsomething else (ibidem, fol. 135rb).\n7. Philosophy of Nature: Potency, Act, and Prime Matter\n\nAs happens very often in the case of medieval authors, the salient\nfeatures of Paul of Venice\u2019s general view about potency and act\n(and possible and real as well) are partly determined by the concrete\napplications that the theory pursues. The specific areas that the\ntheory is called to cover are: (1) the (meta)physical explanation of\nthe nature and modalities of change and coming to be; (2) the\ndetermination of the form of existence of universals with respect to\nsingulars; and (3) the explanation of the process of creation. Paul\nproceeds by divisions that allow him to order this subject according\nto a tree-like scheme that follows in some ways that adopted by\nPorphyry in the chapter on species in his Isagoge. We can\nleave out the minor divisions to concentrate on the main one only. At\nthe basis of Paul\u2019s doctrine of act and potency we find a\ndistinction between potency considerd as a disposition to exist, or\nlogical possibility (the potentia ad esse), and potency as a\ndisposition (proper to something which already exists) to perform or\nachieve something or to undergo a change, or natural possibility (the\npotentia in esse) (see SN, pars vi, ch. 7, fol.\n97ra). This distinction should allow him to separate the\nlogical-theoretical sphere (the potentia ad esse) from the\nphysical one (the potentia in esse). The example chosen to\nillustrate the nature of the potentia ad esse, that is, the\nbirth of the Antichrist, manifests, however, an internal ambiguity in\nhis doctrine. The existence of the Antichrist, in fact, is a possible\nnot in the sense of non-impossible (i.e., something not contradictory\nin itself) but in the sense of that which, while not yet real, is\nhowever infallibly destined to become real.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Italian master does not always adequately\ndistinguish between the concept of potency (potentia) as pure\nlogical possibility (as it was taught by Duns Scotus) and that of\npotency as preformation, that is, a sort of latent pre-existence, in\nsome other thing, of what will be actual/real but is not yet such.\nThis last sense of potency is the one prevalent in Paul, who seems to\nuse the logical sense only in theological contexts, in connection with\nthe theme of divine omnipotence, which enables God to create many more\nspecies than He did (see QdU, conclusio decima). As\na consequence, in the theory of potency and act of Paul of Venice, two\ndifferent fields of investigation converge: the one related to the\nproblem of changes of state and the one related to the\nanalysis of the modal concept of possible. Nicoletti tends to\ntrace back in some way the notion of (logical) possible to that of\ndisposition to undergo a change. He therefore denies that there are\npossibilities that will never come into being (In Metaph.,\nIX, tr. 1, ch. 2, fol. 342rb): \u201cThe opinion of those who claimed\nthat something is possible even if it will never be was false\u201d\n(Falsa fuit opinio dicentium aliquid posse esse quod tamen nullo\nmodo erit). Yet, such a denial \u2013 he adds \u2013 is valid\nony within the philosophy of nature; it must be rejected from a\ntheological point of view ( ibidem).\n\nThe thesis (which he shares with Wyclif and his followers) of the\ncomposition of potency and act proper to all categorial items\n(universal and individual substances, and universal and individual\naccidents \u2013 see SN, pars vi, ch. 4, fol. 95rb) is in\naccord with this approach. In Paul\u2019s opinion, each categorial\nitem is act, and hence form, with respect to the entity that according\nto the high-low direction immediately precedes it in the categorial\nline (linea praedicamentalis), and in potency, and hence\nmatter, with respect to the entity that immediately follows it \u2013\ntaking the terms \u2018matter\u2019 and \u2018form\u2019 in a\nbroad sense (communiter), since \u2018matter\u2019 stands for any\npotential nature and \u2018form\u2019 for any act (or form) contracting some\ngiven nature (cf. ibidem). For instance, the highest genus of\nthe category of substance is immediately composed of act and potency;\nintermediate genera and lowest species immediately of genus and\ndifference, and mediately of act and potency (because of the supreme\ngenus, which is the original constitutive element of their natures);\nand individuals immediately of essence and being (that is to say, as\nPaul puts it, of specific nature and an individuating principle, or\nratio individualis, and mediately of genus and difference\n(because of the lowest species), and of act and potency (because of\nthe highest genus) (SN, pars vi, ch. 4, fol. 95rb; In\nMetaph., V, tr. 2, ch. 2, fol. 184ra; and book XII, tr. 1, ch. 4,\nfols. 433va and 434ra-b; In Cat., cap. de\nsubstantia, fols. 54vb, 55ra, and 55rb-va).Thus, for example,\nmammal is in act with respect to animal, of which it\nactualises a potentiality, and in potency with respect to\nfeline, which in turn actualises a potentiality of\nmammal. The Porphyrian (see Isagoge, chs. on genus\nand on species) and neo-Platonic idea of potentiality as a productive\ncapacity reinforces this interpretation. As a result, what is\npotential, because it is more universal, comes first and is more\nimportant than what is actual, and therefore real (In\nMetaph., V, tr. 2, ch. 4, fol. 193ra) \u2013 a scale of values\nthat overturns the Aristotelian one. As is evident, the notions of act\nand potency are central to Paul\u2019s ontology, since potency and\nact constitute the first, basic, and most universal type of\ncomposition of created beings. Every other type of composition somehow\npresupposes it.\n\nIf the concept of act is taken up quite faithfully from Aristotle,\nPaul\u2019s concept of potency conflates the Aristotelian one with\nthe Neoplatonic one. For this reason, the Aristotelian pre-eminence of\nact over potency is weakened in more than one aspect \u2013 as we\nhave already seen. And finally, the pure potentiality of Aristotelian\nprime matter is read in terms of the theory of rationes\nseminales, and therefore as an innate disposition to receive any\nform. In Paul\u2019s opinion, prime matter has in itself the\n\u201cright\u201d places to set every form, since it is like the\ncoffer in which are contained in potency all the forms of the things\nthat will be generated in nature. His theory combines the two\nAristotelian notions of matter (that of matter as the ultimate\nsubstratum, common to all the materials of which things are made, and\nthat of matter as a pure potentiality) with Augustine\u2019s notion\nof rationes seminales, the \u201cgerminative\u201d\nprinciples of natural species. According to Paul, with the exception\nof those forms directly created by God, such as celestial\nintelligences and human souls (see In Metaph., V, tr. 2, ch.\n4, fol. 193ra), all substantial forms derive from some passive potency\n(defined as the capacity to undergo change) present in prime matter\nand really distinct from it. Such potencies are universal (so to\nspeak), in the sense that the continuous generation of singular things\nto which they give rise is aimed at the maintenance in being of a\nspecific nature. Every potency is capable of producing a form of a\ncertain kind an infinite number of times. Hence, no natural form\npasses from absolute non-being to being, but from potency to act,\nsince it has always had its own kind of existence (potentialiter\net seminaliter) as a sort of disposition in prime matter. Such\npotencies (or dispositions) are perpetual, ingenerable, and\nincorruptible, coeternal with matter itself. As a consequence,\naccording to Paul, the generation of natural forms is like a passage\nfrom an indefinite and potential being, typical of what is universal,\nto the full and actual existence of what is singular. In order to\nproduce a complete thing (namely, a thing composed by matter and form)\nfrom matter, in addition to the raw material with its dispositions (or\npotencies), the intervention of natural agents, both singular and\nuniversal, is required. The potencies of matter, inasmuch as they\norder matter to the production of complete things different in species\nare, in a broad sense, \u201cgerminative\u201d principles of the\nnatural species. On the contrary, a ratio seminalis in the\nstrictest sense of the term is that disposition, caused by an agent in\na suitable material, which predisposes that material to receive a form\nof the same kind of the form proper to the agent itself \u2013 a\ndisposition which is by nature capable of operating even without the\nnatural agent. Thus the potencies of matter are like the primordial\nseeds of the species (that are to be produced) \u201csown\u201d in\nthe matter itself (SN, pars vi, ch. 6, fol. 96va)\n\nAccording to Paul of Venice, such \u201cgerminative\u201d principles\n(rationes seminales) are of three types: substantial,\nqualitative, and relative (SN, pars vi, ch. 7, fol. 97rb).\nAll of them are really distinct from matter and are based on a unique\npassive potency (i.e., a disposition) that is identified with the\nessence, so to speak, of prime matter (SN, pars vi, ch. 7,\nfol. 97vb) \u2013 and in this reference to a sort of essence of prime\nmatter we can see the influence of Scotism. As a consequence, this\nbasic potency is a kind of second-order potency, since the forms it\nbrings into being are nothing but the potencies of prime matter, which\nin themselves are dispositional properties. Moreover, this general\npotency of prime matter consists precisely in the property of being in\npotency with respect to any kind of form, and therefore in being able\nto receive all of them (ibidem). The ultimate outcome of\nPaul\u2019s approach is a form of necessitarianism ex\nhypothesi, in that every possible object, although not necessary\nin itself, would nevertheless be necessary with respect to the\nconditions and circumstances that bring it into being, since\nconditions and circumstances have to produce it, if they have the\ncapacity to do so.\n\nPaul is aware of the particular form of necessitarianism inherent in\nhis approach to that issue; hence, he tries to mitigate its effects,\nin order to safeguard the contingency of human events as well as\ndivine freedom, and to loosen, at the level of individuals, the rigid\ncausal chain implied by his theory of potency, act, and prime matter.\nIn the last part of his Quaestio de universalibus, where he\nexpounds his conception of divine exemplarism (decima\nconclusio) and in his commentary on the Isagoge (cap.\nde specie) and in that on the Categories (cap.\nde substantia), where he speaks of individual substances, he\nstates that (1) the properties and dispositions proper to individuals\nare not precisely determined, but vary randomly within a more or less\nwide spectrum of possibilities whose limits are fixed by the specific\nform (In Metaph., IX, tr. 1, ch. 2, fol. 341vb). And, (2)\nalthough reasoning as natural philosophers we should recognise that\nthe models according to which God created things are finite in number\nand correspond to the types of things that actually exist, reasoning\nas theologians we come to understand that God did not create all\npossible species, but only some of them, because divine ideas as\nrationes (i.e., principles of knowledge and not models for\ncreation) are infinite in number and correspond to the purely\npossible, i.e., to that whose notion is not contradictory\n(QsU, decima conclusio, ms. Paris, BN 6433B, fol.\n135ra). This means, for example, that Socrates\u2019 height, weight,\nand actions are not established a priori in their individual\nnature or measure, and neither is Socrates\u2019 life, but their\ntypical form is. As a human being, Socrates\u2019 features and\nbehavior cannot deviate from certain physical-biological parameters\nand certain laws, but the concrete ways of their realisation are not\ngiven a priori and determined by his individual substance. As\na whole, human beings would actualise, i.e., make real, in time (if\nthey had endless time at their disposal) all the infinite\npossibilities inherent in their nature (a sort of \u2018weak\u2019\nprinciple of plenitude applied to species only), but no human\nindividual as such (i.e., as an individual) is obliged by nature to\nactualise precisely those potentialities/possibilities that he/she\nmakes real.\n\nIn this way, Paul of Venice implicitly states two theses concerning\nindividuals: (1) the thesis of the partial indeterminacy of their\nfeatures and properties, and (2) that of the substantial\nunpredictability of their behavior. According to him, the only way to\nascertain the presence of some potency, i.e., of a real possibility,\nis to ascertain its realisation, i.e., the passage to actuality.\nMoreover, he seems to admit the existence in individuals of\npotencies/possibilities that will not reach actuality \u2013 that is,\nof capacities that will never be developed. All men can laugh, and\nthis potency/possibility is real even in those who have never laughed\nand never will (commentary on the Isagoge, cap. de\nproprio). Yet, we can reasonably infer the presence in a given\nindividual of a undeveloped potency/possibility if we have previously\nobserved its actualisation in many other individuals of the same\nspecies. What is absolutely inconceivable from this perspective is the\npossibility of a real novelty, i.e., a real change, in the universe.\nIn this view, whatever effect is produced (the \u2018act\u2019) is\nimmediately traced back to a pre-existing reality (the\n\u2018potency\u2019) which is not different from the effect it is\nintended to explain, but is, in some way, the effect itself at an\nincomplete stage of being. What is now real was already present in\nreality, but in a different way. Creation itself, as we have seen, is\ninterpreted according to this scheme by means of the theory of divine\nexemplarism. In conclusion, it can be said that in a sense\nthe world has always existed, if not in act then at least virtually\n(as a real and not merely logical possibility) in God\u2019s mind and\nomnipotence.\n",
