    "main_text": "Conceptions of Divine Revelation\n1. Conceptions of Divine Revelation\n\nRevelation, as commonly understood, has to do with the dispelling of\nignorance. The counterpart of \u201cthe revealed\u201d, therefore,\nis \u201cthe hidden\u201d (Wolterstorff 1995: 23). However, the term\nhas many meanings or uses\u2014religious as well as\nnon-religious\u2014which are related to each other analogically. A\ndistinction should be made, first, between the process and product\nmeaning of the word. \u201cRevelation\u201d can either refer to the\nact/process of revealing something, or to the content that is\nrevealed. Second, while in ordinary discourse one can \u201chave a\nrevelation\u201d without there being a revealer (an agent that\nreveals), in religious contexts revelation is usually understood as a\n\u201cperson-to-person affair\u201d (Helm 1982: 14; Mavrodes 1988:\n96).\n\nThe following scheme (S) identifies the elements that are necessary\nfor a revelatory claim (a claim that a revelation has occurred) to be\ntrue:\n\n(S)\n m reveals a to n by means of (through, etc.)\nk (Mavrodes 1988: 88).\n\n\nIn addition to a revealer (m) and an audience (n), an\nact of revelation must have a content (a) that is made known or\navailable to the audience through some means (k). Given this\nscheme, several areas of controversy can be pin-pointed. Since the\ntopic is divine revelation, m is of course identified with God.\nHowever, in contemporary Christian thought, there is a debate about\nthe nature of a. Is the content of divine revelation\npropositions about or related to God, or is it God himself, or both\n(O\u2018Collins 2016a: Ch. 1)? Many theologians emphasize that God\nreveals himself rather than propositions or\n\u201cinformation\u201d. This debate (to which we will return) must\nbe understood against the background of the Christian doctrine of the\nincarnation, which claims that God \u201cbecame flesh and lived among\nus\u201d (John 1: 14).\n\nFurthermore, there is a debate about whether n\u2014the\naudience\u2014includes only those who have actually acquired\nknowledge through the revelation, or if n can also include\nthose who potentially could have acquired such knowledge, but\nin fact did not. In other words, is revelation a \u201csuccess\nword\u201d or does it cover cases where knowledge is merely made\navailable? (For different views, see Sluys 2000; Blaauw 2009; Gunton\n1995: 113; O\u2019Collins 2016a: 76).\n",
