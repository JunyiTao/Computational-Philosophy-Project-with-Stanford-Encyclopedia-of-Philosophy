    "main_text": "Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain || Dividing Pleasure or Finding True Pleasure?\n3.3 Dividing Pleasure or Finding True Pleasure?\n\nPlato and later Greek thinkers, as also many of ancient India,\ndistinguished kinds of pleasure connected with craving kinds of desire\nfrom kinds of pleasure that involve no desire or need and hence none\nof the suffering, tension, or stress connected with these. Similar\nquestions arise in interpreting the neuroscience of affect,\nmotivation, and addiction today.\n\nAccording to Adam Smith (1790/1976), \u201c[h]appiness consists in\ntranquillity and enjoyment. Without tranquillity there can be no\nenjoyment; and where there is perfect tranquillity there is scarce any\nthing which is not capable of amusing.\u201d (III, 3, 30, p. 149) And\nin Utilitarianism John Stuart Mill distinguishes between\nexcitement and tranquillity as two sources of contentment, the first\nallowing us to tolerate pain and the second the absence of pleasure\n(1971, Ch. II,\n \u00b613).[29]\n They thus draw on distinctions prominent in Hellenistic traditions,\nsuch as those of Epicurean and Stoic\n thought,[30]\n which (unlike Mill) advised against the more activated and\ndesire-driven forms of pleasure and took the happiest life to be one\nof calm and tranquillity. (Cf. Haybron, 2008 on attunement and\ntranquillity, passim.) Such advice had antecedents in\nPlato\u2019s hostility to pleasure connected with strong desires and\nin Aristotle\u2019s ranking the calm pleasure of reviewing already\npossessed knowledge over those of attaining and producing new\nknowledge, of competitive achievement, and of satisfying worldly\n desires.[31]\n Making such distinctions is consonant with Ivar Labukt\u2019s recent\nsuggestion (2012) that experiential views of pleasure may err not in\nbeing experiential but in neglecting the possibility that pleasure may\nbe more than one kind of experience.\n\nIndic traditions are rich not only in recommendations of nonattachment\nas a path to tranquillity but also in their long history of analysis\nof experiential states associated with traditional meditation\npractices. The Pali Canon of the Theravadin Buddhists, in passages\nthat have parallels in other Buddhist traditions, describes\nprogressively deeper stages of meditative concentration\n(jhana), passing through which one first stops initiating and\nsustaining thought, then ceases also activating joyful interest\n(p\u012bti), and finally loses even the underlying feeling of\n(perhaps nonintentional) pleasure, bliss, or ease (sukha, in\na narrow sense), so that one then abides in a state of equanimous,\nall-accepting upekkha (etymologically, \u2018looking\non\u2019), sometimes traditionally described as without pleasure\n(sukha) or pain (dukkha) but occasionally as\npleasant (sukha). The difference between joyful interest and\n(mere) pleasure (traditionally classified as a feeling rather than\nwith the predominantly intentional states such as joyful interest) is\nexplained in the commentary tradition by the contrast between the\nstate of a hot and weary desert traveler when first hearing of, and\nthen seeing, a pool of water in a shady wood and the state of one\nactually enjoying, or resting after, using\n it.[32]\n The latter is said to be preferred by the meditator as less coarse,\npresumably because it is a purer and more restful pleasure in that it\nis less mixed with eager interest and motivation, which seem tainted\nwith stress, strain, or pain. Similar distinctions, between appetitive\nstates that prepare animals for anticipatory, preparatory, or\ninstrumental action and functionally later consummatory states that\nend these and initiate consummatory behaviors and end in repose, have\nbeen used for at least the past century in the scientific studies of\nbehavior and mind (Sherrington 1906/1947, pp. 329 ff.; W. Craig 1918;\nDavidson 1994).\n\nIn contemporary affective neuroscience, similar interpretative\nquestions arise. Here also we find a condition of activated interest\nand motivation that many have been tempted to identify with pleasure.\nActivation of the brain\u2019s mesolimbic dopamine system organizes many\nespecially of the instrumental pursuits that bring our lives not only\nulterior rewards but also meaning. However it seems also to drive our\ncompulsions and the craving desire unrelieved by euphoria typical at\ntimes of withdrawn cocaine addicts. The apparent paradoxes facing a\ngeneral pleasure interpretation of such dopaminergic activity have led\nmany scientists studying these systems, including former advocates, to\nback off from that and similar interpretations (e.g., Wise 1994). The\ndistinction between pleasure and pain may be made elsewhere in the\nbrain.\n\nThe theoretically inclined affective neuroscientist Kent Berridge has\nfor decades influentially argued that mesolimbic dopamine itself gives\nno true pleasure, but that a core neural basis for a state of\n\u2018liking\u2019 involved in conscious pleasure is mediated by\nother brain activity, including some involving opioid receptors and\nsometimes cannabinoid receptors as well. These seem to be involved in\norganizing the circuit and network activity that makes possible the\nsavoring more prominent in the consummatory, satisfying, and relaxing\nphases of meals, sexual activity, and personal relations and, so far\nas we know, all other pleasure and enjoyment as well, even as\nmesolimbic dopamine \u2019wanting\u2019 seems typically more\nprominent in the earlier and more exploratory, appetitive,\ninstrumental, and approach phases of these. Berridge and his\ncollaborators persuasively argue that without the participation of\nlocalized hedonic \u2019hotspot\u2019 activity there is no true\npleasure, with specific transmitter activity in these small areas\nalways required. While so far as is known such results may apply with\ngenerality, the preponderance of evidence as of yet comes from\ninvasive experiments on rodents, and therefore relies on expressive\nand voluntary behavior to indicate pleasure. (See Berridge references\nand his website linked below for new review articles, Kringelbach\nreferences, papers in their jointly edited 2010. For a complementary\nperspective on relevant opioid systems, see Depue and\nMorrone-Strupinksy 2005, especially \u00a76.1.2,\npp.\u00a0323\u201325). The emerging picture seems not one of\n\u2019pleasure centers\u2019 or \u2019pleasure transmitters\u2019\nbut of diverse neurons capable of behaving flexibly, in different\nmodes, and thus able to collectively self-organize into different\ncircuits and different networks with changing input and\nneuromodulation, some of which differences make the differences\nbetween feeling happy, so-so, or sad. But we must remember that this\nscience is still very much a work in progress and that the picture\nis growing more, not less, complex at this time. \n\nPerhaps the two normally functionally integrated modes of activity,\nBerridge\u2019s \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019,\norganize fundamentally different affective, motivational, and\nexperiential states that, however often they occur mixed or temporally\nintermeshed, should be considered distinct successors to our naive and\nundiscriminating common conception of pleasure. However, to the extent\nthat the relevant concept of pleasure is a normative one, so too will\nthis question of succession be. It is tempting to regard\nBerridge\u2019s \u2018liking\u2019, when unmixed with\n\u2018wanting\u2019and pain, as the undriven, pure and true pleasure\nthat contemplatives and philosophers have long been seeking, and to\nfollow Berridge in regarding this \u2018liking\u2019 detachable from\nany object (cf. the stance of 3.3 above), as (true)\npleasure\u00a0\u2013 and dopaminergic \u2018wanting\u2019 as the\nfool\u2019s pleasure dross from which it and we ideally should be\nfreed to live like Epicurean gods. However, we may still, in practice,\nneed to alternate between the preponderance of the two (cf. Mill,\n1871, Ch.\u00a0II,\u00b613). Pleasure may thus commonly arise as a\nrelatively fragile and transient outgrowth of a larger biological\nsyndrome of pursuit and temporary attainment, much as in\nAristotle\u2019s analogy of pleasure\u2019s perfecting an activity\nwith the bloom of youth \u2018coming on top of\u2019 biological\nmaturation, using a term, epigignomenon, earlier applied in\nmedicine to an aggravating symptom arising from a grounding and\nunderlying diseased state (NE X, 4:1174b31\u201333, Liddell\nand Scott, 1940, ad loc. epigignomai). \n\nBased on the scientific evidence, if pleasure comes apart, it will be\nalong such lines, and not along those suggested by concern with\nintentional structure (between attitude and object) or between sensory\npleasure, enjoyment of activities, and so-called propositional\npleasure that armchair philosophical and linguistic analysis suggests.\nBut this should come as no surprise. Mood disorders and their\ntherapies do not discriminate along such a priori lines either\n(Millgram 1997, 124 citing Katz 1986, 119).\n",
