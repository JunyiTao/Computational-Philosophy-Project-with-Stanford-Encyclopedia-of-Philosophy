    "main_text": "The Advantages of Deontological Theories\n3. The Advantages of Deontological Theories\n\nHaving canvassed the two main types of deontological theories\n(together with a contractualist variation of each), it is time to\nassess deontological morality more generally. On the one hand,\ndeontological morality, in contrast to consequentialism, leaves space\nfor agents to give special concern to their families, friends, and\nprojects. At least that is so if the deontological morality contains\nno strong duty of general beneficence, or, if it does, it places a cap\non that duty\u2019s demands. Deontological morality, therefore, avoids the\noverly demanding and alienating aspects of consequentialism and\naccords more with conventional notions of our moral duties.\n\nLikewise, deontological moralities, unlike most views of\nconsequentialism, leave space for the supererogatory. A deontologist\ncan do more that is morally praiseworthy than morality demands. A\nconsequentialist cannot, assuming none of the consequentialists\u2019\ndefensive maneuvers earlier referenced work. For such a pure or simple\nconsequentialist, if one\u2019s act is not morally demanded, it is morally\nwrong and forbidden. Whereas for the deontologist, there are acts that\nare neither morally wrong nor demanded, some\u2014but only\nsome\u2014of which are morally praiseworthy.\n\nAs we have seen, deontological theories all possess the strong\nadvantage of being able to account for strong, widely shared moral\nintuitions about our duties better than can consequentialism. The\ncontrasting reactions to Trolley, Fat Man, Transplant, and other\nexamples earlier given, are illustrative of this.\n\nFinally, deontological theories, unlike consequentialist ones, have\nthe potential for explaining why certain people have moral standing to\ncomplain about and hold to account those who breach moral duties. For\nthe moral duties typically thought to be deontological in\ncharacter\u2014unlike, say, duties regarding the\nenvironment\u2014are duties to particular people, not duties\nto bring about states of affairs that no particular person has an\nindividual right to have realized.\n",
