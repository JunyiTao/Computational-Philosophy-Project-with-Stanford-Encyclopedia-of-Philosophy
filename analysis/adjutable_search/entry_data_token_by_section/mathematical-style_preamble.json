    "main_text": "\n\nThe essay begins with a taxonomy of the major contexts in which the\nnotion of \u2018style\u2019 in mathematics has been appealed to\nsince the early twentieth century. These include the use of the notion\nof style in comparative cultural histories of mathematics, in\ncharacterizing national styles, and in describing mathematical\npractice. These developments are then related to the more familiar\ntreatment of style in history and philosophy of the natural sciences\nwhere one distinguishes \u2018local\u2019 and\n\u2018methodological\u2019 styles. It is argued that the natural\nlocus of \u2018style\u2019 in mathematics falls between the\n\u2018local\u2019 and the \u2018methodological\u2019 styles\ndescribed by historians and philosophers of science. Finally, the last\npart of the essay reviews some of the major accounts of style in\nmathematics, due to Hacking and Granger, and probes their\nepistemological and ontological implications.\n",
