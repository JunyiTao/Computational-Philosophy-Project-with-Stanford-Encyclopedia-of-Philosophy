    "main_text": "The Three Means of Persuasion || Is There an Inconsistency in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetorical Theory?\n5.4 Is There an Inconsistency in Aristotle\u2019s Rhetorical Theory? \n\nOne of the most notorious debates about Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric concerns the second means of persuasion\n(pistis) that is said to proceed through the emotions of the\nhearer (see above\n \u00a75.2),\n for it seems to involve a major inconsistency in Aristotle\u2019s\napproach to rhetorical persuasion: While in Rhetoric I.2\nAristotle is happy to accept emotions or the arousal of emotions as\none of the three \u2018technical\u2019 pisteis, it seems\nthat he has a much more reserved or even repudiating attitude to the\nrhetorical use of emotions in Rhetoric I.1. There, in the\nvery first chapter of the book, Aristotle claims that the previous\nauthors of rhetorical manuals have only covered a small part of the\nart of persuasion, for while only the proofs or means of persuasion\n(pisteis), such as the enthymeme, are a matter of\ntechn\u00ea, those authors mostly dealt with rhetorical\ndevices that are merely supplementary and involve \u201cspeaking\noutside the subject\u201d. Aristotle exemplifies this alleged\ntendency of his predecessors by adding that \u201cslander, pity,\nanger and suchlike passions of the soul\u201d are not about the\nthings at issue, but are directed at the person of the juror or judge\n(1354a11\u201318). Briefly afterwards he adds that one \u201cshould\nnot distort the juror or judge by arousing anger, fear or pity in\nhim\u201d, which, he says, would be like making the standard or\nyardstick crooked before using it (1354a24\u201326). Apart from the\nfact that Rhetoric I.2 endorses the rhetorical use of\nemotions, while Rhetoric I.1 seems to dismiss them, the\nremarks in Rhetoric I.1 seems to imply that the arousal of\nemotions is not or cannot be \u2018technical\u2019, while\nRhetoric I.2 unequivocally introduces persuasion through the\nemotions of the hearer as one of three \u2018technical\u2019 means\nof persuasion.\n\nVarious strategies have been contrived to deal with this seeming\ninconsistency. In the early 20th century there was the tendency to\nthink that the two chapters are simply incompatible and that either\none of these two chapters was written by a different author (Marx\n1900) or that the two chapters were put together by an inept editor\n(Kantelhardt 1911; in a similar vein, Barnes (1995, 262) argues that\nthe two chapters are doublets, one of them originally written to\nsupplant the other) or that the two chapters represent different\nstages in Aristotle\u2019s philosophical development (Solmsen 1929).\nEven though Solmen\u2019s developmental account has gone out of\nfashion, there are more recent authors who emphasize the alleged\n\u2018Platonic\u2019 character of Rhetoric I.1 (see e.g.\nFortenbaugh 1986, 248 and Schuetrumpf 1994, 106f.), thus implying that\nAristotle, when writing this chapter, was still under the influence of\nPlato, from which he gradually emancipated himself. However, one might\nwonder whether some of the strategies mentioned tend to exaggerate the\nalleged inconsistency of the two chapters, since, after all, it is\nobvious that the two chapters have different agendas (see above\n \u00a7 2)\n and that some of the differences might be due to these different\nagendas. Also, in the later chapter Aristotle is happy to refer back\nto the treatment of emotions in the previous chapter\n(1356a16\u201317), which indicates (provided that this back-reference\nis authentic) that he himself was not aware of any inconsistency. It\nhas hence been suggested e.g. that the seeming inconsistency can be\nfixed just by identifying different meanings of the word\npistis for the two chapters (Grimaldi 1957), which would\nsolve the problem that in one chapter emotions are said to be a\npistis in the \u2018technical\u2019 sense, while in the\nother chapter they are opposed to \u2018technical\u2019\npisteis. Sprute 1994 and, similarly, Schuetrumpf 1994 argue\nthat the chapters are not inconsistent, but envisage different\nsettings, in that Rhetoric I.1 considers the kind of rhetoric\nthat is apt for a well-ordered city, while Rhetoric I.2 moves\non to the style of rhetoric that is required and practiced under less\nideal political circumstances. Rapp 2002 (I 364, II 32f., 109, 112)\nproposes that what Aristotle primarily criticizes in Rhetoric\nI.1 is not that those predecessors deal with emotions at all, but that\nthey mostly deal with emotions and the like, which are merely\nsupplementary, instead of dealing with the main point, i.e. the\nenthymeme, and that they use pre-fabricated formulae for the arousal\nof emotions, by which they are bound to speak outside the things at\nissue. Dow 2007 uses a similar idea of set-piece rhetorical devices,\ngoing however beyond the previous suggestion by saying that the\ncritique of Rhetoric I.1 does not, as it may seem, refer to\nemotions strictly speaking, but only to such set-piece rhetorical\ndevices aimed at manipulating emotions. On these accounts it is possible,\nat least, to reconcile the claims that there is a\n\u2018technical\u2019 and innocent (or, perhaps, even beneficial)\nuse of emotions within the art-based process of persuasion, as\nmaintained in Rhetoric I.2, and that there are\nnon-\u2018technical\u2019 uses of emotions in rhetoric with the\npotential to distort the judgement, as emphasized in Rhetoric\nI.1.\n",
