    "main_text": "Counterfactuals || Analysis\n3.2 Analysis\n\nThe basic idea behind the alternative analysis was similar to that\nproposed by Robert Stalnaker (1968). Let\u2019s say that an\nA-world is simply a possible world where A is true.\nStalnaker had proposed that p \u25a1\u2192 q was\ntrue just in case the most similar p-world to the actual\nworld is also a q-world. Lewis offered a nice graphic way of\nthinking about this. He proposed that we think of similarity between\nworlds as a kind of metric, with the worlds arranged in some\nlarge-dimensional space, and more similar worlds being closer to each\nother than more dissimilar worlds. Then Stalnaker\u2019s idea is that\nthe closest p-world has to be a q-world for\np \u25a1\u2192 q to be true. Lewis considered\nseveral ways of filling out the details of this proposal, three of\nwhich will be significant here.\n\nFirst, he rejected Stalnaker\u2019s presupposition that there is a\nmost similar p-world to actuality. He thought there might be\nmany worlds which are equally similar to actuality, with no\np-world being more similar. Using the metric analogy\nsuggested above, these worlds all fall on a common\n\u2018sphere\u2019 of worlds, where the centre of this sphere is the\nactual world. In such a case, Lewis held that p \u25a1\u2192\nq is true if and only if all the p-worlds on this\nsphere are q-worlds. One immediate consequence of this is\nthat Conditional Excluded Middle, i.e., (p \u25a1\u2192\nq) \u2228 (p \u25a1\u2192 ~q) is not a\ntheorem of counterfactual logic for Lewis, as it was for\nStalnaker.\n\nSecond, he rejected the idea that there must even be a sphere of\nclosest p-worlds. There might, he thought, be closer and\ncloser p-worlds without limit. He called the assumption that\nthere was a sphere of closest worlds the \u201cLimit\nAssumption\u201d, and noted that we could do without it. The new\ntruth conditions are that p \u25a1\u2192 q is true\nat w if and only if there is a p \u2227\nq-world closer to w than any p \u2227\n\u00acq-world, or that there is no p world.\n\nThird, he considered dropping the assumption that w is closer to\nitself than any other world, or even the assumption that w is among\nthe worlds that are closest to it. When we think in terms of\nsimilarity (or indeed of metrics) these assumptions seem perfectly\nnatural, but some philosophers have held that they have bad proof\ntheoretic consequences. Given the truth conditions Lewis adopts, the\nassumption that w is closer to itself than any other world is\nequivalent to the claim that p \u2227 q entails\np \u25a1\u2192 q, and the assumption that w is\namong the worlds that are closest to it is equivalent to the claim\nthat p \u25a1\u2192 q and p entail\nq. The first of these entailments in particular has been\nthought to be implausible. But Lewis ultimately decided to endorse it,\nin large part because of the semantic model he was using. When we\ndon\u2019t think about entailments, and instead simply ask ourselves\nwhether any other world could be as similar to w as w is to itself,\nthe answer seems clearly to be no.\n\nAs well as offering these semantic models for counterfactuals, in the\nbook Lewis offers an axiomatisation of the counterfactual logic he\nprefers (see Table 6 in Section 3.3 of the entry\n logic of conditionals),\n as well as axiomatisations for several other logics that make\ndifferent choices about some of the assumptions we\u2019ve discussed\nhere. And he has proofs that these axiomatisations are sound and\ncomplete with respect to the described semantics.\n\nHe also notes that his preferred counterfactual logic invalidates\nseveral familiar implications involving conditionals. We already\nmentioned that strengthening the antecedent, the implication of\n(p \u2227 r) \u25a1\u2192 q by p\n\u25a1\u2192 q, is invalid on Lewis\u2019s theory, and gave\nsome natural language examples that suggest that it should be invalid.\nLewis also shows that contraposition, the implication of ~q\n\u25a1\u2192 ~p by p \u25a1\u2192 q, and\nconditional syllogism, the implication of p \u25a1\u2192\nr by p \u25a1\u2192 q and q\n\u25a1\u2192 r, are invalid on his model, and gives\narguments that they should be considered invalid.\n",
