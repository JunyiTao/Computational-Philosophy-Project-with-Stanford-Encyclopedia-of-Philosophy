    "main_text": "What Legal Interpretation Seeks\n2. What Legal Interpretation Seeks\nLawyers and judges are familiar with various competing theories or methods of legal interpretation and with arguments for and against those theories. (This chapter uses the terms theory of legal interpretation and method of legal interpretation interchangeably.) Leading theories include, for example, textualism, originalism, intentionalism, and purposivism. The questions of which theory is correct, and of the different theories\u2019 pros and cons, are important. But there is a more fundamental question that is less often addressed: what is legal interpretation? More specifically, what does legal interpretation, by its nature, seek? What is its constitutive aim?\nMany activities are defined or constituted in part by their aims. Medicine and cooking are examples. Someone who examines people, prescribes medicines, and performs surgeries is not practicing medicine unless these activities are undertaken for the appropriate purposes. Of course, individual physicians may have many other purposes, such as earning money or impressing people, but such ends are not what the practice of medicine, by its nature, seeks.\nLegal interpretation starts from certain input, such as legal texts and practices, actions and mental states of certain legal actors, and customs. (It is controversial exactly what the input should include, though certain texts are central.) And legal interpretation yields an output \u2013 \u201can interpretation.\u201d The familiar debate concerns which method of getting from the input to the output is correct. But the more basic issue concerns what the output is supposed to be \u2013 what legal interpretation seeks. (For brevity, I will often write simply of what legal interpretation seeks; the qualification \u201cby its nature\u201d should be understood.) In the case of constitutional and statutory provisions, for example, is it the linguistic meaning of the text of the relevant provision? The provision\u2019s contribution to the content of the law? The best resolution of disputes? Or something else?\nThis issue is more fundamental than more familiar questions about the method of interpretation because which method is correct (and which reasons or arguments count in favor of a method) depends on what legal interpretation seeks. In general, how good a method is depends on what the method is for. The appropriate method for finding, say, the linguistic meaning of a text is likely very different from the appropriate method for finding the best resolution of a dispute. Similarly, the fact that a method is fair or democratic might well be irrelevant if legal interpretation seeks linguistic meaning, but highly relevant if it seeks the best resolution of disputes.\nBefore turning to the leading candidates for what legal interpretation seeks, it is worth considering the recurrent suggestion that interpretation takes place only when the answer to a legal question is not obvious.[1] We can quickly dispense with this suggestion. It does not capture what paradigmatic theories of legal interpretation are engaged in, for the prescriptions offered by such theories apply to easy problems as well as difficult ones. Moreover, the suggestion would have the unfortunate consequence that legal interpretation would not be a unified subject matter. (Compare excluding from the subject of chemistry those chemical reactions that are already well understood.) Whether one is seeking linguistic meaning, the content of the law, or the best resolution of a dispute, one is engaged in the same enterprise when the issues are easy as when they are difficult. A closely related point is that whether a particular legal issue is easy or difficult is relative to the interpreter. For an experienced tax lawyer, the answer to an arcane tax question may be obvious. The suggestion would therefore have the consequence that what counts as legal interpretation depends on who is doing the interpretation (and when).\nPerhaps surprisingly, most of the literature on legal interpretation does not consider the foundational question of legal interpretation\u2019s constitutive aim.[2] In evaluating methods of interpretation, writers tend to appeal to whatever considerations strike them as valuable without addressing what legal interpretation is for. For example, Philip Frickey suggests that the way to evaluate purposivism is by asking \u201cwhether the interpretations that this theory produces are more worthwhile for a legal system than would be literalist or intentionalist ones\u201d (2006, 851\u201352).[3]\nIt is likely that the term \u201clegal interpretation\u201d is not always used with a precise and univocal meaning. We have some paradigms of theories of legal interpretation, but it may well be that they are not all engaged in exactly the same enterprise. To the extent that the term has different uses, it\u2019s probably not helpful to try to identify the uniquely correct use of the term. Instead, we should ask how the term would be usefully regimented. The primary desideratum should be to accurately capture the central enterprise of influential theories such as textualism, purposivism, and originalism. Another factor that could favor a particular understanding of legal interpretation is whether it has the consequence that the term picks out a theoretically unified enterprise.\n",
