    "main_text": "Values and Emotions || Meinong\u2019s Initial Theory \u2014 Value Subjectivism\n7.2 Meinong\u2019s Later Theory \u2014 Value Objectivism\n\nLater on, Meinong (1912; 1917; 1923) became a value objectivist, and\nvalue theory was taken up into his theory of objects together with his\nepistemology and philosophical psychology. He does not consider value\nexperiences as constitutive of values anymore. Value experiences make\nvalues only accessible to the subject. They have a presenting function\nof their own (\u201cemotional presentation\u201d) and are a means of\napprehending values analogous to sensations in perception. Moreover, a\nvalue experience or value attitude has to be distinguished from the\ncorresponding value judgement. Despite the subjectivity of sensible\nqualities, one does not want to talk about a personal color or a\npersonal hardness, Meinong says. In a similar vein, it is not the case\nthat each value has to be a personal value just because it comes to us\nonly through the mediation of value experiences (1923, Chapt. IV,\n\u00a77: 152). Perception includes perceptual judgements on the basis\nof sensations, i.e., perceptive representations\n[Wahrnehmungsvorstellungen]. The value judgement completes\nthe valuation as the perceptual judgement completes the perception:\n(1) just as one is permitted to derive the existence of colored things\nfrom color sensations, so one is justified in deriving the realization\nof value properties from value experiences; (2) just as sensations can\nbe illusory and even hallucinatory, so emotions may be unwarranted;\nthe judgement that an object has value may be false, hence, genuine\nvalue errors (and not only errors concerning the presupposed cognitive\njudgements) are possible. Because emotions are more susceptible to a\nsubjective bias, they are not as reliable a source of knowledge as\nsensations are (1912: 13). Meinong is no longer either a value\nsubjectivist or a relativist. He became a realist concerning objective\nvalues as he believes that value experiences are able to present not\nonly subjective, personal values but also objective, absolute,\nimpersonal values: \u201cAn object has value in this [new] sense not\njust because a subject is interested in it, but only insofar it merits\nthis interest.\u201d (1912, Sect. IV: 12)\n\nYet, Meinong does not give up the assumption of personal values. A\npersonal value of an object is the emotional significance\n[emotionale Bedeutung] that a subject is disposed to assign\nto that object (1923, Chapt. IV, \u00a76: 144\u20135, \u00a77: 162),\nor, in other words, it is the aptitude of the object to arouse a\ncertain value experience in the subject (1917, \u00a713: 151\n[132], 156 [136]). Impersonal values, by contrast,\nare not based on value attitudes; they are independent from them, but\nwe can give them a subjective characterization (not a definition). As\nan object in its most general sense is describable, although not\ndefinable, as something that is able to become an object of\nexperience, values can also be described (but not defined) by their\ndispositional property of being able to become objects of value\nexperiences. However, value experiences are not only a means of\nrecognizing a dispositional value property; they are also a means of\nrecognizing the actual value property, that is the underlying\nfoundation or basis of the disposition. In accordance with\nMeinong\u2019s theory of dispositional properties (1919), a\ndisposition has an actual quality as its foundation. The actual\nfeature that is the foundation of the disposition to generate value\nexperiences in the subject is determined purely objectively, i.e.,\nwithout any reference to subjects. According to Meinong, there are\nobjective values, interpreted (1) as dispositions to produce value\nexperiences, and (2) as the foundations of this disposition (1923,\nChapt. IV, \u00a77: 151).\n\nThe genuine objects of emotions are called \u201cdignitatives\u201d;\nexamples are the good and the beautiful. Ought [Sollen] and\nexpediency [Zweckm\u00e4\u00dfigkeit] are the paradigms of\nthe so-called desideratives, the genuine objects of desires (1917,\n\u00a711). Like objectives, the genuine objects of thinking, both\ndignitatives and desideratives can subsist or\n not,[3]\n and they are ideal objects and cannot be reduced to something mental\nor physical. As value properties are not reducible to natural\nproperties, they are in some way unanalyzable. Goodness, for example\ncannot be defined in terms of pleasure, and moral value judgements are\nnot to be reduced to psychological or sociological reports on moral\nbehavior. Furthermore, dignitatives and desideratives have a complex\nnature because the presuppose certain things and states of affairs. A\nperson has an aesthetic emotion, for example, when a building is\npresented to her as beautiful. The presented beauty (of the building)\nis the genuine, proper object [Eigengegenstand] \u2014 the\ndignitative \u2014 of the aesthetic emotion, while the building\nitself is the presupposed, appropriated [angeeignete\nGegenstand] of the emotion in question. Dignitatives and\ndesideratives then are objects of higher order (1917: 107\u20138\n[95\u20136]) \u2014 they are superiora (see above\n5.5; against the view that ought is an object of higher order, see\nWeber 2004: 31\u20133). Just as one can see four nuts as a square of\nnuts, or a circle with two dots and an arc as a smiling face, so a\ndonation to a charitable fund can be seen (grasped) as a morally good\ndeed. Grasping value properties can be interpreted as a certain kind\nof grasping of a Gestalt, as Ehrenfels and other Gestalt theorists\nmight have said. There are, we might say, good-Gestalten (the Gestalt\nof the moral good, the aesthetic good, and so on). The main difference\nbetween this sort of \u201cvalue perception\u201d and sensory\nperception is that, instead of (or in addition to) sense impressions,\nemotional impressions are involved. Meinong thinks that \u201cthe\nindefinability of impersonal values is not to be put on a par with the\none of color or sound, but rather with the one of melody or form\n[Gestalt]\u201d (1923, Chapt. IV, \u00a77: 161).\n\nMeinong calls the dignitatives and the desideratives that are of\nimpersonal nature \u201cdignities\u201d and\n\u201cdesiderata\u201d, respectively (1917, \u00a715). Axiological\n(and deontological) knowledge is possible since feelings (and desires)\nthat present factual dignities (and desiderata) can be justified. A\nfeeling can be described as justified if the corresponding judgement\nattributing the dignity to the presupposed object is justified (1917,\n\u00a712). Meinong sees here a kinship to Brentano\u2019s \u201clove\nwith the character of rightness\u201d or \u201ccorrect love\u201d\n(Brentano 1889, \u00a727), which can be understood as\n\u201cevidence-analogue\u201d to the evidence of judgements, but\nMeinong emphasizes that only the evidence of judgements itself makes\nsuch a justification possible and \u201can evidence-analogue for\nfeelings and desires is therefore not required\u201d (1917: 131\n[115]). As values have to be taken as ideal things that\ncannot exist but only subsist, Meinong thinks that axiological (and,\nsimilarly, deontological) knowledge is a priori (1917,\n\u00a712). He is convinced that \u201cthere are laws for so to speak\ncorrect desires as there are laws for the correct deriving of\nconclusions\u201d (1917: 128). Already in 1912 Meinong admits\nself-critically that his naturalistic, \u201cexclusively\npsychological\u201d account of value has been shown to rest on an\ninadmissible, faulty psychologism (see also 1917: 168\n[146]).\n",
