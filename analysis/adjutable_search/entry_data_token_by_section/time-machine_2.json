No-go results for (Thornian) time machines in classical general relativity theory\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the physics literature aimed at proving no-go \nresults for time machines it is helpful to view these efforts as part\nof the broader project of proving chronology protections \ntheorems, which in turn is part of a still larger project of \nproving cosmic censorship theorems. To explain, we start \nwith cosmic censorship and work backwards.\n\n\nFigure 3.\nA bad choice of initial value surface\n\n\n\nFor sake of simplicity, concentrate on the initial value problem for \nvacuum solutions \\((T_{ab} \\equiv 0)\\) to Einstein\u2019s \nfield equations. Start with a three-manifold \\(\\Sigma\\) equipped with \nquantities which, when \\(\\Sigma\\) is embedded as a spacelike submanifold\nof spacetime, become initial data for the vacuum field equations. \nCorresponding to the initial data there exists a \n unique[20]\n maximal development \n \\((\\mathcal{M}, g_{ab})\\) for which (the image \nof the embedded) \\(\\Sigma\\) is a Cauchy \n surface.[21]\n This solution, however, may not be maximal simpliciter, i.e., it may \nbe possible to isometrically embed it as a proper part of a larger \nspacetime, which itself may be a vacuum solution to the field \nequations; if so \\(\\Sigma\\) will not be a Cauchy surface for the \nextended spacetime, which fails to be a globally hyperbolic \n spacetime.[22]\n This situation can arise because of a poor choice of initial value \nhypersurface, as illustrated in \n Figure 3\n by taking \\(\\Sigma\\) to be the indicated spacelike hyperboloid of \\((1 + \n1)\\)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. But, more interestingly, the \nsituation can arise because the Einstein equations allow various \npathologies, collectively referred to as \u201cnaked \nsingularities,\u201d to develop from regular initial data. The \nstrong form of Penrose\u2019s celebrated cosmic censorship \nconjecture proposes that, consistent with Einstein\u2019s field \nequations, such pathologies do not arise under physically reasonable \nconditions or else that the conditions leading to the pathologies are\nhighly non-generic within the space of all solutions to the field \nequations. A small amount of progress has been made on stating and \nproving precise versions of this \n conjecture.[23]\n\n\n\nOne way in which strong cosmic censorship can be violated is through \nthe emergence of acausal features. Returning to the example of Misner\nspacetime \n (Figure 1),\n the spacetime up to \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is \nthe unique maximal development of the vacuum Einstein equations for \nwhich \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is a Cauchy surface. But this development \nis extendible, and in the extension illustrated in \n Figure 1\n global hyperbolicity of the development is lost because of the \npresence of CTCs. The chronology protection conjecture then \ncan be construed as a subconjecture of the cosmic censorship \nconjecture, saying, roughly, that consistent with Einstein field \nequations, CTCs do not arise under physically reasonable conditions \nor else that the conditions are highly non-generic within the space \nof all solutions to the field equations. No-go results for time \nmachines are then special forms of chronology protection theorems \nthat deal with cases where the CTCs are manufactured by time \nmachines. In the other direction, a very general chronology \nprotection theorem will automatically provide a no-go result for time\nmachines, however that notion is understood, and a theorem \nestablishing strong cosmic censorship will automatically impose \nchronology protection.\n\n\nThe most widely discussed chronology protection theorem/no-go result \nfor time machines in the context of classical general relativity \ntheory is due to Hawking (1992a). Before stating the result, note \nfirst that, independently of the Einstein field equations and energy \nconditions, a partial Cauchy surface \\(\\Sigma\\) must be compact if its \nfuture Cauchy horizon \\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is compact (see\nHawking 1992a and Chrusciel and Isenberg 1993). However, it is \ngeometrically allowed that \\(\\Sigma\\) is non-compact if \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma)\\) is required only to be compactly \ngenerated rather than compact. But what Hawking showed is that this \ngeometrical possibility is ruled out by imposing Einstein\u2019s field \nequations and the weak energy condition. Thus, if \\(\\Sigma_0\\)\nis a partial Cauchy surface representing the situation just before or\njust as the would-be Thornian time machine is switched on, and if a \nnecessary condition for seeing a Thornian time machine at work is \nthat \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly \ngenerated, then consistently with Einstein\u2019s field equations and the \nweak energy condition, a Thornian time machine cannot operate in a \nspatially open universe since \\(\\Sigma_0\\) must be compact.\n\n\nThis no-go result does not touch the situation illustrated in \n Figure 1.\n Taub-NUT spacetime is a vacuum solution to Einstein\u2019s field equations\nso the weak energy condition is automatically satisfied, and \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compact and, a \nfortiori, compactly generated. Hawking\u2019s theorem is not contradicted \nsince \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is compact. By the same token the theorem \ndoes not speak to the possibility of operating a Thornian time \nmachine in a spatially closed universe. To help fill the gap, Hawking\nproved that when \\(\\Sigma_0\\) is compact and \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly generated, \nthe Einstein field equations and the weak energy condition together \nguarantee that both the convergence and shear of the null geodesic \ngenerators of \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) must \nvanish, which he interpreted to imply that no observers can cross \nover \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) to enter the \nchronology violating region \\(V\\). But rather than showing that \nit is physically impossible to operate a Thornian time machine in a \nclosed universe, this result shows only that, given the correctness \nof Hawking\u2019s interpretation, the observers who operate the time \nmachine cannot take advantage of the CTCs it produces.\n\n\nThere are two sources of doubt about the effectiveness of Hawking\u2019s \nno-go result even for open universes. The first stems from possible \nviolations of the weak energy condition by stress-energy tensors \narising from classical relativistic matter fields (see Vollick 1997 \nand Visser and Barcelo \n 2000).[24]\n The second stems from the fact that Hawking\u2019s theorem functions as a \nchronology protection theorem only by way of serving as a potential \nno-go result for Thornian time machines since the crucial condition \nthat \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly \ngenerated is supposedly justified by being a necessary condition for \nthe operation of such machine. But in retrospect, the motivation for \nthis condition seems frayed. As argued in the previous section, if \nthe Einstein field equations and energy conditions entail that all \nhole free extensions of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \ncontain CTCs, then it is plausible to see a Thornian time machine at \nwork, quite regardless ofwhether or not \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is compactly generated or\nnot. Of course, it remains to establish the existence of cases where \nthis entailment holds. If it should turn out that there are no such \ncases, then the prospects of Thornian time machines are dealt a \nsevere blow, but the reasons are independent of Hawking\u2019s theorem. On\nthe other hand, if such cases do exist then our conjecture would be \nthat they exist even when some of the generators of \n\\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) come from singularities \nor infinity and, thus, \\(H^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) is\nnot compactly \n generated.[25]\n\n",
