    "main_text": "Tackling the Second Horn of Hume\u2019s Dilemma || Inductive Justifications of Induction\n4.1 Inductive Justifications of Induction\n\nOne way to tackle the second horn of Hume\u2019s dilemma is to reject\n premise P6,\n which rules out circular arguments. Some have argued that certain\nkinds of circular arguments would provide an acceptable justification\nfor the inductive inference. Since the justification would then itself\nbe an inductive one, this approach is often referred to as an\n\u201cinductive justification of induction\u201d.\n\nFirst we should examine how exactly the Humean circularity supposedly\narises. Take the simple case of enumerative inductive inference that\nfollows the following pattern (X):\n\n\nMost observed Fs have been Gs\n\nTherefore: Most Fs are Gs.\n\n\nHume claims that such arguments presuppose the Uniformity Principle\n(UP). According to premises\n P7\n and\n P8,\n this supposition also needs to be supported by an argument in order\nthat the inductive inference be justified. A natural idea is that we\ncan argue for the Uniformity Principle on the grounds that \u201cit\nworks\u201d. We know that it works, because past instances of\narguments which relied upon it were found to be successful. This alone\nhowever is not sufficient unless we have reason to think that such\narguments will also be successful in the future. That claim must\nitself be supported by an inductive argument (S):\n\n\nMost arguments of form X that rely on UP have succeeded in\nthe past.\n\nTherefore, most arguments of form X that rely on UP\nsucceed.\n\n\nBut this argument itself depends on the UP, which is the very\nsupposition which we were trying to justify.\n\nAs we have seen in\n section 2,\n some reject Hume\u2019s claim that all inductive inferences\npresuppose the UP. However, the argument that basing the justification\nof the inductive inference on a probable argument would result in\ncircularity need not rely on this claim. The circularity concern can\nbe framed more generally. If argument S relies on\nsomething which is already presupposed in inference\nX, then argument S cannot be used to justify\ninference X. The question though is what precisely the\nsomething is.\n\nSome authors have argued that in fact S does not rely on any\npremise or even presupposition that would require us to already know\nthe conclusion of X. S is then not a \u201cpremise\ncircular\u201d argument. Rather, they claim, it is\n\u201crule-circular\u201d\u2014it relies on a rule of inference in\norder to reach the conclusion that that very rule is reliable. Suppose\nwe adopt the rule R which says that when it is observed that\nmost Fs are Gs, we should infer that most\nFs are Gs. Then inference X relies on rule\nR. We want to show that rule R is reliable. We could\nappeal to the fact that R worked in the past, and so, by an\ninductive argument, it will also work in the future. Call this\nargument S*:\n\n\nMost inferences following rule R have been successful\n\nTherefore, most inferences following R are successful.\n\n\nSince this argument itself uses rule R, using it to establish\nthat R is reliable is rule-circular.\n\nSome authors have then argued that although premise-circularity is\nvicious, rule-circularity is not (Cleve 1984; Papineau 1992). One\nreason for thinking rule-circularity is not vicious would be if it is\nnot necessary to know or even justifiably believe that rule R\nis reliable in order to move to a justified conclusion using the rule.\nThis is a claim made by externalists about justification (Cleve 1984).\nThey say that as long as R is in fact reliable, one\ncan form a justified belief in the conclusion of an argument relying\non R, as long as one has justified belief in the\npremises.\n\nIf one is not persuaded by the externalist claim, one might attempt to\nargue that rule circularity is benign in a different fashion. For\nexample, the requirement that a rule be shown to be reliable without\nany rule-circularity might appear unreasonable when the rule is of a\nvery fundamental nature. As Lange puts it:\n\n\nIt might be suggested that although a circular argument is ordinarily\nunable to justify its conclusion, a circular argument is acceptable in\nthe case of justifying a fundamental form of reasoning. After all,\nthere is nowhere more basic to turn, so all that we can reasonably\ndemand of a fundamental form of reasoning is that it endorse itself.\n(Lange 2011: 56)\n\n\nProponents of this point of view point out that even deductive\ninference cannot be justified deductively. Consider Lewis\nCarroll\u2019s dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise (Carroll\n1895). Achilles is arguing with a Tortoise who refuses to perform\nmodus ponens. The Tortoise accepts the premise that\np, and the premise that p implies q but he\nwill not accept q. How can Achilles convince him? He manages\nto persuade him to accept another premise, namely \u201cif p\nand p implies q, then q\u201d. But the\nTortoise is still not prepared to infer to q. Achilles goes\non adding more premises of the same kind, but to no avail. It appears\nthen that modus ponens cannot be justified to someone who is\nnot already prepared to use that rule.\n\nIt might seem odd if premise circularity were vicious, and rule\ncircularity were not, given that there appears to be an easy\ninterchange between rules and premises. After all, a rule can always,\nas in the Lewis Carroll story, be added as a premise to the argument.\nBut what the Carroll story also appears to indicate is that there is\nindeed a fundamental difference between being prepared to accept a\npremise stating a rule (the Tortoise is happy to do this), and being\nprepared to use that rule (this is what the Tortoise refuses to\ndo).\n\nSuppose that we grant that an inductive argument such as S\n(or S*) can support an inductive inference X without\nvicious circularity. Still, a possible objection is that the argument\nsimply does not provide a full justification of X. After all,\nless sane inference rules such as counterinduction can support\nthemselves in a similar fashion. The counterinductive rule is CI:\n\n\nMost observed As are Bs.\n\nTherefore, it is not the case that most As are\nBs.\n\n\nConsider then the following argument CI*:\n\n\nMost CI arguments have been unsuccessful\n\nTherefore, it is not the case that most CI arguments are unsuccessful,\ni.e., many CI arguments are successful.\n\n\nThis argument therefore establishes the reliability of CI in a\nrule-circular fashion (see Salmon 1963).\n\nArgument S can be used to support inference X, but\nonly for someone who is already prepared to infer inductively by using\nS. It cannot convince a skeptic who is not prepared to rely\nupon that rule in the first place. One might think then that the\nargument is simply not achieving very much.\n\nThe response to these concerns is that, as Papineau puts it, the\nargument is \u201cnot supposed to do very much\u201d\n(Papineau 1992: 18). The fact that a counterinductivist counterpart of\nthe argument exists is true, but irrelevant. It is conceded that the\nargument cannot persuade either a counterinductivist, or a skeptic.\nNonetheless, proponents of the inductive justification maintain that\nthere is still some added value in showing that inductive inferences\nare reliable, even when we already accept that there is nothing\nproblematic about them. The inductive justification of induction\nprovides a kind of important consistency check on our existing\nbeliefs.\n",
