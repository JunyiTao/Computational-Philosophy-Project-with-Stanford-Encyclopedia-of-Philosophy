    "main_text": "The Argument From Skepticism || Contextualism and Skepticism\n6. Closure of Rational Belief\n\nTo say that justified belief is closed under entailment is to say that\nsomething like one of the following principles is correct (or that\nboth are):\n\n(J)\nIf, while justifiably believing p, S\nbelieves q because S knows p entails\nq, then S justifiably believes q.\n(GJ)\nIf, while justifiably believing various propositions,\nS believes p because S knows that they entail\np, then S justifiably believes p.\n\n\nHowever, GJ generates paradoxes (Kyburg 1961). To see why,\nnotice that if the chances of winning a lottery are sufficiently\nremote, I am justified in believing that my ticket, ticket 1, will\nlose. I am also justified in believing that ticket 2 will lose, and\nthat 3 will lose, and so on. However, I am not justified in believing\nthe conjunction of these propositions. If I were, I would justifiably\nbelieve that no ticket will win. If a proposition is justified when\nprobable enough, lottery examples undermine GJ. No matter how\ngreat the probability that suffices for justification, unless that\nprobability is 1, in some lotteries we will be justified in believing,\nof an arbitrary ticket, that it will lose, and thus, by GJ, we\nwill be justified in believing that all of the tickets will lose.\n\nEven if we reject GJ, it does not follow that we must reject\nGK, which concerns knowledge closure. Consider the\nlottery example again. How justified we are in believing that ticket 1\nwill lose depends on how probable its losing is. Now, the probability\nthat ticket 2 will lose is equal to the probability that ticket 1 will\nlose. The same goes for each ticket. However, consider the\nconjunction, Ticket 1 will lose & ticket 2 will lose. The\nprobability of this conjunctive proposition is less than the\nprobability of either of its conjuncts. Suppose we continue to add\nconjuncts. For example, next in line will be: Ticket 1 will lose\n& ticket 2 will lose & ticket 3 will lose. Each time a\nconjunct is added, the probability of the resulting proposition is\nstill lower. This illustrates the fact that we can begin with a\ncollection of propositions each of which surpasses some threshold\nlevel of justification (let it be whatever is necessary for a belief\nto count as \u201cjustified\u201d according to GJ) and, by\nconjoining them, we can end up with a proposition which falls below\nthat threshold level of justification. We may \u201cjustifiably\nbelieve\u201d each conjunct, but not the conjunction, so GJ\nfails. However, we need not reject GK on these grounds. Even if\nwe grant that we justifiably believe that Ticket 1 will\nlose is true we might deny that we know that this\nproposition is true. We might take the position that if we believe\nsome proposition p on the basis of its probability, nothing\nless than a probability of 1 will suffice to enable us to know that it\nis true. In that case GK will not succumb to our objection to\nGJ, for if the probability of two or more propositions is 1\nthen the probability of their conjunction is also 1. \n\nWe can reject GJ. Should we also reject J? The status of\nthis principle is much more controversial. Some theorists argue\nagainst it using counterexamples like Dretske\u2019s own zebra case:\nbecause the zebra is in plain sight, you seem fully justified in\nbelieving zeb, but it is not so clear that you are justified\nin believing not-mule, even if you deduce this belief from\nzeb. Anyone who rejects K on the grounds that\nK sanctions the knowledge of limiting or heavyweight\npropositions (discussed earlier) is likely to reject J on\nsimilar grounds: justifiably believing that we have hands, it might\nseem, does not position us to justifiably believe that there are\nphysical objects even if we see that the former entails the latter.\n\n\nOne response is that cases such as Dretske\u2019s do not count against\nJ, but rather against the following principle (of the\ntransmissibility of evidence):\n\n(E)\nIf e is evidence for p, and p\nentails q, then e is evidence for q.\n\n\nEven if we reject this principle, it does not follow that\njustification is not closed under entailment, as Peter Klein (1981)\npointed out. Arguably, for justification closure, all that is\nnecessary is that when, given all of our relevant evidence e,\nwe are justified in believing p, we also have\nsufficient justification for believing each of p\u2019s\nconsequences. Our justification for p\u2019s consequences need not\nbe e. Instead, it might be p itself, which is, after\nall, a justified belief. And since p entails its\nconsequences, it is sufficient to justify them. Moreover, any good\nevidence we have against a consequence of p counts against\np itself, preventing us from being justified in believing\np in the first place, so if we are justified in believing\np, considering all our evidence, pro and con, we will not\nhave overwhelming evidence against propositions entailed by\np. (A similar move could be defended against the tracking\ntheorists when they deny the closure of knowledge: if we track\np, and believe q by deducing it from p,\nthen we track q if we take p as our basis for\nbelieving q.) Looked at in this way, J seems\nplausible. (There is a substantial literature on the transmissibility\nof evidence and its failure; see, for example, Crispin Wright (1985)\nand Martin Davies (1998).\n\nSome final observations can be made using Roderick Firth\u2019s (1978)\ndistinction between propositional and doxastic justification.\nProposition p has propositional justification for S if and\nonly if, given the grounds S possesses, p would\ncount as rational. That p has propositional justification for\nS does not require that S actually base p\non these grounds, or even that S believe p. Whether\nS\u2019s belief has doxastic justification depends on S\u2019s\nactual grounds for believing p: if, on these grounds,\np would count as rational, then p possesses doxastic\njustification. Consider the following principles:\n\n(JD)\nIf p is doxastically justified for S, and\np entails q, then q is doxastically\njustified for S.\n(JP)\nIf p is propositionally justified for S,\nand p entails q, then q is propositionally\njustified for S.\n\n\nClearly JD faces two fatal objections. First, we might fail to\nbelieve some of the things implied by our beliefs. Second, we may have\nperfectly respectable reasons for believing something p, yet,\nfailing to see that p entails q, we might not be\naware of any grounds for believing q, or, worse, we might\nbelieve q for bogus reasons. But neither difficulty threatens\nJP. First, propositional justification does not entail belief.\nSecond, S might be propositionally justified in believing\nq on the basis of p whether or not S fails\nto see that p entails q, and even if S\nbelieves q for bogus reasons. As further support for\nJP, we might cite the fact that, if p entails\nq, whatever counts against q also counts against\np.\n",
