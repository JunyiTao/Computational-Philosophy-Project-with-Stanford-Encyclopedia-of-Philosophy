    "main_text": "Motivations || Incompleteness and incomparability\n2.2 Incompleteness and incomparability\nVarious arguments for (precise) probabilism assume that some\nrelation or other is complete. Whether this is a preference over acts,\nor some \u201cqualitative probability ordering\u201d, the relation\nis assumed to hold one way or the other between any two elements of\nthe domain. This hardly seems like it should be a principle of\nrationality, especially in cases of severe uncertainty. That\nis\u2014to take the preference example\u2014it is reasonable to have\nno preference in either direction. This is an importantly different\nattitude to being indifferent between the options. Mark\nKaplan argues this point as follows:\n\nBoth when you are indifferent between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) and when you are undecided\nbetween \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) you can be said not to prefer either\nstate of affairs to the other. Nonetheless, indifference and\nindecision are distinct. When you are indifferent\nbetween \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\), your failure to prefer one to the\nother is born of a determination that they are equally\npreferable. When you are undecided, your failure to prefer one to the\nother is born of no such determination. (Kaplan\n1996: 5)\n\nThere is a standard behaviourist response to the claim\nthat incomparability and indifference should be distinguished. In\nshort, the claim is that it is a distinction that cannot be inferred\nfrom actual agents\u2019 choice behaviour. Ultimately, in a given choice\nsituation you must choose one of the options. Which you choose can be\ninterpreted as being (weakly) preferred. Joyce offers the following\ncriticism of this appeal to behaviourism.\n\nThere are just too many things worth saying that cannot be said\nwithin the confines of strict behaviorism\u2026 The basic difficulty\nhere is that it is impossible to distinguish contexts in which an\nagent\u2019s behavior really does reveal what she wants from contexts in\nwhich it does not without appealing to additional facts about her\nmental state\u2026 An even more serious shortcoming is behaviorism\u2019s\ninability to make sense of rationalizing explanations of\nchoice behavior. (Joyce 1999: 21)\n\nOn top of this, behaviourists cannot make sense of the fact that\nincomparable goods are insensitive to small\nimprovements. That is, if \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are two goods that you have no\npreference between (for example, bets on propositions with imprecise\nprobabilities) and if \\(A^+\\) is a good\nslightly better than \\(A\\), then it might\nstill be incomparable with \\(B\\). This\ndistinguishes incomparability from indifference, since indifference\n\u201cties\u201d will be broken by small improvements. So the claim\nthat there is no behavioural difference between indifference and\nincomparability is false.\nKaplan argues that not only is violating the completeness axiom\npermissible, it is, in fact, sometimes obligatory.\n\n[M]y reason for rejecting as falsely precise the demand that you\nadopt a \u2026 set of preferences [that satisfy the preference\naxioms] is not the usual one. It is not that this demand is not\nhumanly satisfiable. For if that were all that was wrong, the\ndemand might still play a useful role as a regulative ideal\u2014an\nideal which might then be legitimately invoked to get you to\n\u201csolve\u201d your decision problem as the orthodox Bayesian\nwould have you do. My complaint about the orthodox Bayesian demand is\nrather that it imposes the wrong regulative ideal. For if you have\n[such a] set of preferences then you have a determinate assignment of\n[\\(p\\)] to every hypothesis\u2014and then you\nare not giving evidence its due. (Kaplan 1983:\n571)\n\nHe notes that it is not the case that it is always unreasonable or\nimpossible for you to have precise beliefs: in that case precision\ncould serve as a regulative ideal. Precise probabilism does still\nserve as something of a regulative ideal, but it is the belief of an\nideal agent in an idealised evidential position. Idealised\nevidential positions are approximated by cases where you have a coin\nof a known bias. Precise probabilists and advocates of IP both agree\nthat precise probabilism is an idealisation, and a regulative\nideal. However, they differ as to what kind of idealisation is\ninvolved. Precise probabilists think that what precludes us from\nhaving precise probabilistic beliefs is merely a lack of computational\npower and introspective capacity. Imprecise probabilists think that\neven agents ideal in this sense might (and possibly should)\nfail to have precise probabilistic beliefs when they are not in an\nideal evidential position.\nAt least some of the axioms of preference are not normative\nconstraints. We can now ask what can be proved in the absence of the\n\u201cpurely structural\u201d\u2014non-normative\u2014axioms? This\nsurely gives us a handle on what is really required of the structure\nof belief.\nIt seems permissible to fail to have a preference between two\noptions. Or it seems reasonable to fail to consider either of two\npossibilities more likely than the other. And these failures to assent\nto certain judgements is not the same as considering the two elements\nunder consideration to be on a par in any substantive\nsense. That said, precise probabilism is serving as a regulative\nideal. That is, precision might still be an unattained (possibly\nunattainable) goal that informs agents as to how they might improve\ntheir credences. Completeness of preference is what the thoroughly\ninformed agent ought to have. Without complete preference, standard\nrepresentation theorems don\u2019t work. However, for\neach completion of the incomplete preference\nordering\u2014for each complete ordering that extends the incomplete\npreference relation\u2014the theorem follows. So if we consider the\nset of probability functions that are such that some completion of the\nincomplete preference is represented by that function, then we can\nconsider this set to be representing the beliefs associated with the\nincomplete preference. We also get, for each completion, a utility\nfunction unique up to linear transformation. This, in essence, was\nKaplan\u2019s position (see Kaplan 1983;\n1996).\nJoyce (1999: 102\u20134) and\nJeffrey (1984: 138\u201341) both make\nsimilar claims. A particularly detailed argument along these lines for\ncomparative belief can be found in Hawthorne\n(2009). Indeed, this idea has a long and distinguished history\nthat goes back at least as far as B.O. Koopman\n(1940). I.J Good (1962), Terrence\nFine (1973) and Patrick\nSuppes (1974) all discussed ideas along\nthese lines. Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane\n(1995) give a representation theorem for preference that don\u2019t\nsatisfy completeness. (See Evren and Ok 2011;\nPedersen 2014; and Chu and Halpern 2008, 2004; for very general\nrepresentation theorems).\n",
