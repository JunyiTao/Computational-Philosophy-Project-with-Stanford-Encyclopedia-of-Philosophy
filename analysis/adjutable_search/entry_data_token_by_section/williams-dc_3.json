    "main_text": "Metaphysics\u2014Ontology\n4. Metaphysics\u2014Ontology\n\nApart from his Materialistic or Spatio-Temporal Naturalism,\nWilliams\u2019s major contributions to metaphysics lie in the realm\nof ontology, and concern the fundamental constituents of Being. His\nkey proposal is that properties are indeed real\u2014in fact Reality\nconsists in nothing but properties\u2014but that these properties are\nnot Universals, as commonly supposed, but particulars with unique\nspatio-temporal locations. The structure of Reality comprises a single\nfundamental category, Abstract Particulars, or \u201ctropes\u201d.\nTropes are particular cases of general characteristics. A general\ncharacteristic, or Universal, such as redness or roundness, can occur\nin any one of indefinitely many instances. Williams\u2019 focus was\non the particular case of red which occurs as the color, for example,\nof a particular rose at a specific location in space and time, or the\nparticular case of circularity presented by some particular coin in my\nhand on a single, particular occasion. These tropes are as particular,\nand as grounded in place and time, as the more familiar objects, the\nrose and the coin, to which they belong.\n\nThese tropes are the building blocks of the world. In his analogy,\nthey provide \u2018the Alphabet of Being\u2019 from which the\nentities belonging to more complex categories\u2014objects,\nproperties, relations, events\u2014can be constructed, just as words\nand sentences can be built using the letters of the alphabet. Familiar\nobjects such as shoes and ships and lumps of sealing wax, and their\nparts as revealed by empirical scientific investigation, such as\ncrystals, molecules and atoms, are concrete particulars or things. In\nWilliams\u2019s scheme, each of these consists in a\ncompresent cluster of tropes\u2014the particular\nthing\u2019s particular shape, size, temperature, and consistency,\nits translucency, or acidity, or positive charge, and so on. All the\nmultitude of different tropes that comprise some single complex\nparticular do so by virtue of their sharing one and the same place, or\nsequence of places, in Space-Time. That is what\n\u2018compresent\u2019 means. There is no inner substratum or\nindividuator to hold all the tropes together. The tropes are\nindividuals in their own right, and do not inhere in any thing-like\nparticular. So Williams\u2019s view is a No-Substance theory, or,\notherwise described, a theory in which each trope is itself a simple\nHumean substance, capable of independent existence.\n\nUniversal properties and quantities such as acidity and velocity,\nwhich are common to many objects, are not beings in their own right,\nbut resemblance classes of individual tropes. If two objects\nmatch in color, both being red, for example, the tropes of color\nbelonging to each are separate tropes, both being members of the class\nof similar color tropes which constitutes Redness.\n\nRelations are treated along the same lines. If London is Larger-than\nEdinburgh, and Dublin Larger-than Belfast, we have two instances of\nthe Larger-than relation, two relational tropes. And they, along with\ncountless other cases, all belong to the resemblance class whose\nmembers are all and only the cases of Larger-than. This account denies\nthat, literally speaking, there is any single entity which is\nsimultaneously fully present in two different cases of the same color,\nor temperature, or whatever. So it is a No-Universals view, and often\ndescribed as a version of Nominalism. This is understandable, but it\nis better to confine the term \u2018Nominalism\u2019 to the denial\nof the reality of properties at all. So far from denying properties,\non Williams\u2019s theory the entire world consists in nothing but\ntropes, which are properties construed as particulars. So his position\nis better described not as Nominalist but as Particularist.\n\nTropes provide an elegant and economical base for an ontology. Unlike\nalmost all competing ontologies, that of Williams rests on just one\nbasic category, which can be used in the construction not just of\nthings and their properties and relations, but of further categories,\nsuch as events and processes. Events are replacements of the tropes\nthat are to be found in a given location. Processes are sequences of\nsuch changes. Trope theory is well placed to furnish an attractive\nanalysis of causality, as involving power tropes that govern and drive\nthe transformations to be found in events and processes.\n\nIt can also be of use in other areas of philosophy, for example in\nvaluation theory, where the existence of many tropes, rather than one\nsingle unitary reality, can explain our sometimes divided attitudes\ntoward what, on a Substance ontology, we would regard as the same\nthing. Something can be good in some respects (tropes), but not in\nothers. To view the manifest world as comprising, for the most part,\nclusters of compresent tropes makes explicit the complexity of the\nrealities with which we are ordinarily in contact.\n",
