    "main_text": "Other Types of Singular Term\n3. Other Types of Singular Term\n\n\nPorphyry\u2019s divisions by no means exhausted the types of term and\nphrase that could be regarded as singular. For those who accepted\nsimple supposition as supposition for a common nature, \u201cMan is a\nspecies\u201d had a singular subject. Later nominalists regarded the\nsame sentence as indefinite, on the grounds that \u2018man\u2019 had\nmaterial supposition and could refer either to itself or to its\nequiforms. Indeed, any term whatsoever could be taken as having\nmaterial supposition for itself or its equiforms, or as having\npersonal supposition, and in early sixteenth-century Parisian logic\ntexts it was normal to remark that all singular terms are common, and\nall common terms are singular when taken in these different\nways. Collective terms of one sort and another were included under the\nheading of singular terms. \u2018These\u2019 in \u201cThese are\nrunning,\u201d \u2018all God\u2019s apostles\u2019 in \u201cAll God\u2019s\napostles are twelve <in number>,\u201d \u2018Rome\u2019, and\n\u2018Salamanca\u2019 are examples. Phrases containing a mixture of\nsingular and common terms, such as \u2018the being which is\nSocrates\u2019, were also counted as singular. Other phrases\ncontaining mixtures of singular and common terms together with logical\nconnectives were the subject of many rules and lengthy discussions\nfrom the late fourteenth century onward. Thus we discover that\n\u2018Socrates or Plato\u2019 is a common term because it can be\nverified of more than one thing while \u2018Socrates and Plato\u2019\nis a collective singular term. On the other hand, if we write\n\u2018Socrates and a donkey\u2019, the phrase is common because it\ncontains a common term as an equally principal part. This feature\ndistinguishes it from aggregates in which the singular term determines\nthe common term, as in \u2018the substance John\u2019 and \u2018the\nman Socrates\u2019.\n",
