    "main_text": "Physics: The Post-Critical Period (Opus postumum)\n4. Physics: The Post-Critical Period (Opus postumum)\n\nKant\u2019s interest in physics continued after the publication of\nthe Metaphysical Foundations, in fact, until the very end of\nhis productive years. Though Kant never completed a manuscript that\ncould be put forward as a publication, the various notes, sketches,\nand drafts on topics in physics that he was working on intensively\nduring this time (especially after 1796) were gathered together over a\ncentury after his death and published as his so-called Opus\npostumum. It is a highly fragmentary work where Kant\u2019s\nthoughts remained in flux through the final parts, written ca. 1802.\nAccordingly, scholarship has sought to recover the evolution,\nbackground and import of his reflections, rather than some stable\ndoctrine, which it mostly lacks. Below we touch on his reason for\nwriting the Opus at all; two major themes relevant to\nphilosophy of science; and some implications for his natural\nphilosophy.\n\nWhy did Kant around 1796 begin to draft a new work? Most interpreters\nagree that he thought the Opus aimed to fill a\n\u2018gap\u2019 of sorts. In letters from 1798, he speaks\ncryptically about there being a \u2018gap\u2019 in his Critical\nphilosophy. Many have concluded the Opus aimed to fill\nthis gap, and so they turned their attention to identifying\nit. Some claimed it was a gap in Kant\u2019s theory of matter above\n(in particular, his accounts of mass and density); others saw it\nbetween his constitutive and regulative approaches to metaphysical\nfoundations for science; yet others have said it was a lacuna in his\nschematism of the categories. Lately, Howard (2023) has argued that it\nwas a missing part in the \u2018system of philosophy\u2019 as a\nwhole (hiatus in systemato, 21:476). He reads that as the\nneed to mediate\u2014by devising a bridge doctrine\u2014between\nKant\u2019s metaphysical foundations of natural science and\n\u2018physics as a system.\u2019\n\nThis reading elucidates two obscure parts in the Opus. One is\nKant\u2019s repeated attempts to articulate a\n\u2018transition.\u2019 In the picture that Howard sketches, the\ntransition would be the very mediating doctrine above: between a\ntheory in metaphysics and a body of empirical knowledge. The other is\nKant\u2019s repeated attempts there to define physics such\nthat he can defensibly say it counts as systematic science. For\ninstance: \u201cPhysics is systematic investigation of nature through\nempirically given forces of matter insofar as they are connected to\neach other in a system\u201d (22:298). Note just how broad his\ndefinition is\u2014it makes the various \u2018forces\u2019\ntheorized by early-modern chemistry, heat science, botany and animal\nphysiology count as part of physics qua organized doctrine.\n\nA central theme in the Opus is Kant\u2019s attempt to give\nan a priori proof that a certain entity must exist. He calls it the\n\u2018ether,\u2019 and also \u2018caloric.\u2019 He thought of it\nas a sort of universal substrate\u2014a fluid-like medium that fills\nall of physical space, supports \u2018moving forces,\u2019 and\ncarries their actions from one place to another (much like pressure\napplied at a point in an incompressible fluid travels across it to\nother locations). Kant saw it as his task to give a\n\u2018deduction\u2019 of this medium, viz. a species of\nnon-empirical evidence that it exists. Generally interpreters take his\n\u00c4therbeweis to be an actual deductive argument, which\nthey have tried to reconstruct (see, e.g., F\u00f6rster 2000 and Hall\n2006).\n\nAnother major theme there is Kant\u2019s quest for an\n\u2018elementary system of the moving forces\u2019 of nature. He\nmeans a methodic, or well-ordered, derivation of the\n\u2018specific\u2019 properties of matter. They are specific in that\nnone counts as general, or common to all matter; but none is too\nparticular or transient either. Rather, each is a feature of some\nbroad class of material behavior. Among the properties Kant ponders at\nthis juncture are \u2018heat,\u2019 \u2019weight,\u2019\n\u2019elasticity,\u2019 \u2019solidity,\u2019 and the like. He\ntakes these properties to be associated with \u2018moving\nforces\u2019: they result from some force being exerted (e.g.,\ngravity induces weight) or they cause some force of motion (e.g.\nelastic rebound pushes back the body that compressed an elastic\nmaterial). So, an elementary system of properties will be ipso facto a\nsystem of forces as well. In regard to it, Kant sought a rational\nheuristic: a recipe or criterion for a taxonomic account (of\nthese broadly-specific properties) that is a priori, viz. inferable\nbefore they are empirically discovered.\n\nLastly, what did Kant think his ether\u2014and, alternatively, his\n\u2018elementary\u2019 system\u2014would achieve? Here too,\nscholarship is somewhat divided. Older accounts thought the\n\u2018ether, or caloric\u2019 was Kant\u2019s basis for the bridge\ndoctrine, or transition, between metaphysics and empirical physics.\nMore recently, Howard (2023) has argued for a different line. Namely,\nthat Kant saw the ether deduction (and the taxonomy of\n\u2018elementary\u2019 forces) as the basis for an account of what\nmakes empirical physics a systematic body of knowledge\u2014or would\nmake it so in the long run, if properly pursued.\n\nThe Opus postumum has long been a topic of interest\nespecially insofar as it offers the hope of clarification and\ndevelopment of central issues in Kant\u2019s Critical philosophy.\nMuch scholarship on it was in German (Adickes 1920, Hoppe 1969,\nTuschling 1971, Blasche 1991, and Emundts 2004). Then it received\nincreased attention in English, with discussions by Friedman (1992,\nchapter 5), F\u00f6rster (2000), Edwards (2000), Guyer (2001), and\nHall (2006, 2009). Recent views on the Opus and its reception\nare presented in Basile (2013) and Basile & Lissy (2022). Howard\n(2023) is an overview of its key issues, and a novel reading of the\nnatural-philosophical issues Kant tackled there.\n",
