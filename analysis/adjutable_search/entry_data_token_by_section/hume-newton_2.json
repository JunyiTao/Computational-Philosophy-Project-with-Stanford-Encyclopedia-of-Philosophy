    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Berkeley-ian View of Newton\u2019s Achievements\n3. Hume\u2019s Berkeley-ian View of Newton\u2019s Achievements\n\nIn The History of England, Hume writes about Newton\u2019s\nresearch methodology as follows: \n\n\nthere flourished during this period a Boyle and a Newton: men who trod\nwith cautious, and therefore the more secure steps, the only road\nwhich leads to true philosophy\u2026[Newton is] cautious in\nadmitting no principles but such as were founded on experiment; but\nresolute to adopt every such principle, however new or unusual. (HE\nVI, 542) \n\n\nWhile this is rather terse, Hume calls attention to three important\nelements in Newton\u2019s natural philosophy: (a) Newton\u2019s\ncommitment to an experimental method; (b) the cautious nature of\nNewton\u2019s methodology; (c) Newton\u2019s boldness once\nexperiments have established a \u201cprinciple\u201d. In eighteenth\ncentury terminology, a \u201cprinciple\u201d is akin to what we\nwould call a \u201claw\u201d or a \u201cfundamental/causal\nexplanation\u201d. In order to avoid misunderstanding, Hume equates\nNewton\u2019s methodology with Boyle\u2019s only on points (a) and\n(b), not point (c). Moreover, Hume is aware (as will be shown in\n section 4.1)\n that Newton rightly rejected Boyle\u2019s conception of mechanism.\nSo, Hume admires Newton\u2019s methodology, and sees it as a source\nof progress.\n\nSo, for Hume, Newton uses experiment to arrive at explanations. Thus,\nhe seems to echo and accept Newton\u2019s claim about\n\u201chypotheses non fingo\u201d (see the relevant section\nin the\n entry on Newton).\n Once such \u201cprinciples\u201d or explanations have been arrived\nat experimentally, Hume sees Newton as adopting them boldly, even if\nthey are unusual or surprising. Hume appears to have assimilated the\nimportance of Newton\u2019s third rule of reasoning (see\n section 4.5\n below). Moreover, Hume is discerning the (broad) outlines of\nNewton\u2019s commitment to the method of analysis and synthesis\n(Newton\u2019s Opticks, Query 31; for discussion, see\n section 4.7).\n But in Hume\u2019s account there is no mention of the importance of\nmathematics in Newton\u2019s methodology (see\n section 4.6).\n Hume lack of interest in this aspect of Newton\u2019s methodology\nmay be a consequence of his education (see\n section 2).\n\nNevertheless, Hume\u2019s interpretation of the status of\n\u201cprinciples\u201d makes him deviate from Newton\u2019s\nmethodology in a fundamental fashion. In the Treatise, he\nuses the \u201cscience of man\u201d to claim it is \u201cbeyond the\nreach of human understanding\u201d to \u201cpenetrate into the\nnature of bodies, or explain the secret causes of their\noperations\u201d. He cannot \u201capprove\u201d of the ambition to\ngo beyond knowing bodies by their external properties (THN 1.2.5.25).\nThis contradicts the final paragraph of the \u201cGeneral\nScholium\u201d of the Principia, where Newton promises a\nprogram of research, perhaps inspired by the success of Francis\nHauksbee\u2019s electrical experiments, to penetrate into the nature\nof matter. Although this program was by no means finished by the time\nof Newton\u2019s death, Newton\u2019s optical research had revealed,\nfor example, that light has an internal constitution characterized by\nthe proportions, in it, of the distinct homogeneal (or\n\u201cuniform\u201d) kinds, which have different degrees of\nrefrangibility (Schliesser 2004).\n\nTo see why Hume cannot \u201capprove\u201d, going beyond external\nproperties of bodies, let us take a brief detour through some core\nelements of Hume\u2019s epistemology. For Hume, we build up our\ncausal theories from experience of particular events (see, for\ninstance, the demands at THN 1.3.14.6\u201315 and also the footnote\nat EHU 11.26). This is an important constraint for Hume because it\nallows him to ask who has ever perceived an instance of a power or\nforce in action. This is crucial for Hume\u2019s attack on\ntheoretical and invisible entities.\n\nFor Hume all our simple ideas are derived from impressions (THN\n1.2.3.2\u20133). Hume\u2019s attacks on notions of substance, mode,\nessence, force, power, self, and\u2014of course\u2014God, all rely\non his rhetorically powerful ability to ask to what impression such\nnotions can be traced (e.g., THN 1.1.6; 1.2.5.28; 1.4.14, and\n1.4.5.3\u20134; on idea of God, see EHU 2.6). For, \u201c[I]deas\nalways represent the objects or impressions, from which they are\nderived\u201d (THN 1.2.3.11). In the scholarly literature, this has\nbecome known as the \u201ccopy principle\u201d (Garrett 1997:\nchapter 2). If no such objects or impressions are to be found, then\none must conclude that such ideas are the product of \u201cpassions\nand emotions\u201d (THN 1.1.6.1), a \u201ctrivial suggestion of the\nfancy\u201d (THN 1.4.7.6), or \u201csome imperfection in [the]\nfaculties [of mind]\u201d (THN 1.1.7.8). The thrust of Hume\u2019s\naccount is to make talk of, say, substance or force (power, God, etc.)\nseem either meaningless or restricted to the particular qualities of\nbodies from which the idea is derived (THN 1.1.6.1; EHU 4.2.16). At\nbest, they have reference to \u201can effect, or some other event\nconstantly conjoined with\u201d the cause (EHU 7.2.29; for a more\ndetailed account, see the entry on Hume   ).\n Thomas Reid, who saw what was at stake, described the strategy as\n\u201ca tribunal of inquisition erected by certain modern\nphilosophers before which every thing in nature must answer\u201d\n(An Inquiry into the Human Mind: or the Principles of Common\nSense, Chapter 6, Section VIII). \n\nHume\u2019s \u201cscience of man\u201d will not permit a realist\ninterpretation of forces as real causes (see, for different arguments,\nBroughton 1987; Bell 1997). When the sciences talk about forces or\npowers, these words must be reinterpreted (for example, the note to\nEHU, 4.2.16 tells us to look for this in section 7 of EHU). According\nto Hume, word\u2019s like \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d\nhave, at best, a reference to \u201can effect, or some other\nevent\u201d. And \n\n\nForce, Power, Energy\u2026[these] words, as commonly used, have very\nloose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very uncertain and\nconfused. (EHU 7.2.29; cf. THN 1.3.14.27) \n\n\nHume denies here the fundamental achievement of the\n Principia.[4]\n Rather, he offers a reinterpretation of Newton (Hazony &\nSchliesser 2016).\n\nThis is made very clear by his addition to the Treatise: I\nmust, he writes, \n\n\nconfine our speculations to the appearances of objects to our senses,\nwithout entering into disquisitions concerning their real nature and\noperations. \n\n\nHume is willing to grant that Newton has experimentally discovered\nvarious \u201cprinciples\u201d. But given Hume\u2019s aversion to\ntalk of forces, it is likely that he thinks these principles must be\nunderstood at best as a means to keep track of the phenomena. This is,\nin fact, for Hume the \n\n\nNewtonian philosophy \u2026 rightly understood \u2026\nNothing is more suitable to that philosophy, than a modest skepticism\nto a certain confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human\ncapacity. (THN 1.2.5.26n12; emphasis in original) \n\n\nIn context, Hume re-describes the Newtonian commitment to a vacuum. So\nwhen, elsewhere, Hume describes the \u201cphilosopher\u201d [i.e.,\nNewton] who had \u201cdetermined the laws and forces, by which the\nrevolutions of the planets are governed and directed\u201d, (EHU 1.8)\nhis language of \u201cforces\u201d must be interpreted in light of\nhis deflationary commitments.\n\nOne may think that Hume\u2019s use of \u201cNewtonian\nphilosophy\u201d in the addition to the Treatise suggests\nthat Hume has described Newton\u2019s natural philosophy as Newton\nunderstood it (as understood by Hume). But this is not likely because\nelsewhere he writes, \n\n\nIt was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second causes of\nall force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to\nestablish that theory upon his authority. (footnote at the end of EHU\n7.1.25: a note on Hume\u2019s Terminology: God is the \u201cfirst\ncause;\u201d \u201csecond causes\u201d are ordinary finite causes\nthat operate in nature) \n\n\nSo, first, Hume\u2019s Newton accepts some real causes in nature;\nHume\u2019s Newton is neither a skeptic about causation nor an\noccasionalist (Leibniz had raised this concern in his exchange with\nClarke). Second, Hume is careful to distinguish Newton from the\nNewtonians (for more evidence on this, see\n section 4.2).\n\nThus, a more likely interpretation is that Hume believes he has\noffered a prescriptive interpretation of how Newtonian philosophy\nshould be viewed in light of the results of his \u201cscience of\nman\u201d (which shows the limitations of our cognitive capacity),\nand his restrictive form of Empiricism which contribute to his\n\u201cmodest\u201d (or \u201cmitigated\u201d) skepticism. Hume may\nwell have thought himself as an internal critic or \u201ccautious\nNewtonian\u201d. For Hume and Newton both appeal to the authority of\nexperience. Nevertheless, the \u201ccopy principle\u201d guides how\nHume believes how \u201cexperiment\u201d or\n\u201cexperience\u201d\u2014authoritative for Newton as well as\nHume\u2014should be analyzed. This may be why Hume claims that Boyle\nand Newton have shown the road to the \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d,\nnot that they completed it. One way to understand Hume\u2019s\n\u201cscience of man\u201d is to see it, then, as the fulfillment of\nthe Newtonian philosophy, \u201crightly understood\u201d, that is,\nby Hume.\n\nWhile Hume does not match Berkeley\u2019s detail in offering\narguments or in explaining how to reinterpret Newtonian invisible\nentities, Hume does not accept that we can know that invisible causal\nforces operate in a largely empty universe as anything other than\nuseful means to track the appearances. In fact, there is no room in\nHume\u2019s explanatory model for invisible forces acting as causes.\nThis becomes clear if we reflect on a passage that has received\nintense scrutiny in the context of the problem of induction (which we\nignore for present purposes; for Hume\u2019s skepticism see\n section 4.2):\n\n\nWe are determined by custom alone to suppose the future conformable to\nthe past. When I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, my mind\nis immediately carry\u2019d by habit to the usual effect, and\nanticipates my sight by conceiving the second ball in motion. There is\nnothing in these objects, abstractly considered, and independent of\nexperience, which leads me to form any such conclusion: and even after\nI have had experience of many repeated effects of this kind, there is\nno argument, which determines me to suppose, that the effect will be\nconformable to past experience. The powers, by which bodies operate,\nare entirely unknown. We perceive only their sensible qualities: and\nwhat reason have we to think, that the same powers will always be\nconjoined with the same sensible qualities? \n\nTis not, therefore, reason, which is the guide of life, but custom.\nThat alone determines the mind, in all instances, to suppose the\nfuture conformable to the past. However easy this step may seem,\nreason would never, to all eternity, be able to make it. (THN Abstract\n15\u201316)\n\n\nHume here is calling attention to the (terse) argument of\nTreatise 1.3.6. Our interest is in his claim that \n\n\n[t]he powers, by which bodies operate, are entirely unknown. We\nperceive only their sensible qualities: and what reason have we to\nthink, that the same powers will always be conjoined with the same\nsensible qualities? \n\n\nIn dialectical context, Hume is here presupposing (i) an explanatory\nmodel familiar from Locke (and Spinoza, Aristotle, Boyle, etc.) in\nwhich hidden powers (insensible qualities) of an entity are (causally)\nresponsible for the sensible qualities. So, it is completely natural\nfor early modern natural philosophers to say that these sensible\nqualities express the essence. These hidden powers may be (part of)\nthe essence of the entity or (as Newton suggests about gravity in the\nthird rule of reasoning) universal qualities of an entity. So,\nHume\u2019s implied targets accept something akin to (i). That is not\ninsignificant because (i) is the main explanatory template of early\nmodern science.\n\nNow, if one accepts (i), then the problem of induction reveals two\n(related) problems: (a) one concerns the connection among\nsensible qualities, and (b) the other concerns the connection between\nhidden qualities and the visible qualities. So, if one accepts (i),\none might have thought, for example, that routinely (if not\nexception-less) conjoined sensible qualities must always presuppose\nthe same combination of hidden/invisible qualities that produce them.\nSo, one could solve the problem associated with (a) by an appeal to\nhidden qualities. In thinking this one could, in fact, appeal to a\nsame effect/same cause principle of the sort Newton articulates in the\nsecond rule of reasoning: \u201cto the same natural effects we must,\nas far as possible, assign the same causes\u201d. To be sure,\nNewton\u2019s version of the rule recognizes exceptions and is\nclearly regulative (\u201cas far as possible\u201d) and it does not\nrely on (i). Rather, in Newton the rule is a direct consequence of a\nparsimony principle (\u201cadmit no more causes of natural things\nthan such as are both true and sufficient to explain their\nappearances\u201d).\n\nBut as Hume discerns, the explanatory model of (i) lacks resources to\nsecure anything like \u201csame visible effect/same hidden\ncause\u201d. That\u2019s because Hume thinks there is always a\nbarrier in moving from sensible qualities to the structure of hidden\nqualities. (In the literature on Newton, who also rejects (i), this is\ncalled the \u201ctransduction problem\u201d since an influential\narticle by McGuire 1970a.) Hume makes this point fully explicit in the\nfirst Enquiry: \u201che has not, by all his experience,\nacquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power, by which the one\nobject produces the other\u201d (EHU 5.4).\n\nThis is why Hume\u2019s philosophy of science is so deflationary: all\nany science can show is the relations that obtain among visible\nqualities, and perhaps those that can be represented on an analogy\nwith them (see Landy 2017). These relations can be grouped together\nand given names (\u201celasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts,\ncommunication of motion by impulse\u201d) and be treated as\n\u201ccauses\u201d of the phenomena, but these names do not signify\nor explain features of hidden powers. In Hume\u2019s philosophy of\nscience, science remains at the surface. Hume made the point explicit\nin a note added to the Treatise: \n\n\nIf the Newtonian philosophy be rightly understood it will be found to\nmean no more. A vacuum is asserted: That is, bodies are said to be\nplac\u2019d after such a manner, as to receive bodies betwixt them,\nwithout impulsion or penetration. The real nature of this position of\nbodies is unknown. We are only acquainted with its effects on the\nsenses, and its power of receiving body. (THN 1.2.5.26n12 (App.))\n\n\nThis barrier between visible and hidden qualities/powers is\nindependent of the more fundamental problem of induction that even\nwhen one grasps, in some way, the structure of the hidden qualities\nordinarily responsible for conjunction of sensible qualities, one\ncannot feel secure about their presence and role in any claim one\nmakes about sensible qualities. For, a different set of hidden\nqualities may be responsible for any ordinarily conjoined set of\nsensible qualities. (Hume here discerns the outlines of the problem of\nmultiple realization as a general metaphysical problem.) That, in\naddition, nature may change its course (and so change the\nconfiguration of hidden qualities that produce sensible qualities)\nmeans that the main explanatory framework of early modern science (i)\nis without foundation (see also Belkind 2019).\n",
