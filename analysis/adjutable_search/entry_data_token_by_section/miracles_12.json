    "main_text": "Arguments from Miracles || Would miracles be evidence for the existence of God?\n4.1 Would miracles be evidence for the existence of God?\n\n\nThere are two exceptions to this general acquiescence in the\nevidential value of miracles. First, there is a question regarding the\nidentity of the cause. If God alone can work miracles, this is easily\nsettled; but this claim has been a point of contention in the\ntheological literature, with some writers (Clarke 1719: 305 ff; Trench\n1847) maintaining that lesser, created spirits may work miracles, while\nothers (e.g. Farmer 1771, Wardlaw 1852, Cooper 1876) vigorously deny\nthis. The point is of some interest to the evaluation of arguments for\nmiracles, since as Baden Powell points out, there is a\ndistinction\n\n\nbetween an extraordinary fact,\u2014which is a proper\nmatter for human testimony\u2014and the belief in its being\ncaused by Divine interposition, which is a matter of\nopinion, and consequently not susceptible of support by\ntestimony, but dependent on quite other considerations.\n(Powell 1859: 287\u201388, following up on a distinction made in Less 1773:\n260\u201362)\n\n\nPowell is quite right to say that testimony is not the proper source\nfor evidence of the supernatural nature of the event. But it does not\nfollow that all opinions on the point are equally reasonable. The very\ndescription of the event\u2014and even more, of the context in which\nit occurs\u2014might render any naturalistic alternatives\nnon-starters. Whether this is the case will depend, not on general\nconsiderations, but on the details of the case in question.\n\n\nSecond, it is occasionally argued that, contrary to what most\nphilosophers and theologians have assumed, actual confirmed cases of\nmiracles could not count in favor of the existence of God. George\nChryssides (1975) argues that a miracle, conceived as a violation of a\nscientific law, could never be attributed to any agent, divine or\notherwise, since the assignment of agency implies predictability. This\nbold contention has not attracted many defenders. Gregory Dawes (2009)\npursues a related but more moderate line of argument, urging that it is\ndifficult to meet the standard necessary to attribute particular events\nto the personal agency of God. But Dawes does not present this as an\nabsolute barrier to theistic explanations.\n\n\nOverall (1985) argues for the more radical contention that a miracle\nwould count as evidence against the existence of God, on three\ngrounds: (1) if order and harmony are evidence for the existence of\nGod, then a miracle, which entails a breach in the order and harmony of\nthe universe, must count against the existence of God; (2) the\ninevitable controversies over the identification and authentication of\na miracle are an impediment to the growth of scientific knowledge and\nphilosophical comprehension; and (3) an omnipotent God who does\nintervene in His creation would be obliged, on pain of moral defect, to\nintervene more often and more evenhandedly than He is supposed to have\ndone in the Christian tradition.\n\n\nThese considerations have not, however, moved many philosophers to\nendorse Overall\u2019s position. Argument (1), besides giving a\ntendentious characterization of a miracle, exemplifies a fallacy in\nprobabilistic reasoning, assuming that if \\(F\\) entails \\({\\sim}E\\)\nand \\(E\\) is evidence for \\(H\\), then \\(F\\) is evidence against \\(H\\),\nwhich is not in general true. Claim (2) is arguably simply false, as\nsuch controversies do not appear noticeably to have impeded the\nprogress of science or philosophy. Argument (3) will be effective\nagainst a certain sort of theological position, but it is not one that\nmany believers in miracles actually hold. For further discussion of\nthis issue, see the exchanges between Larmer and Overall (Larmer 1988:\n75\u201382, Overall 1997, Overall 2003, and Larmer 2004).\n",
