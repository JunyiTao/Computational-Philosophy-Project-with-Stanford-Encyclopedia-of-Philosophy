    "main_text": "Ethics\n8. The Influence of Albert the Great\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s influence on the development of scholastic philosophy in the\nthirteenth century was enormous. He, along with his most famous\nstudent Thomas of Aquinas, succeeded in incorporating the philosophy\nof Aristotle into the Christian West. Besides Thomas, Albert was also\nthe teacher of Ulrich of Stra\u00dfburg (1225 \u2013 1277), who\ncarried forward Albert\u2019s interest in natural science by writing a\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Meteors along with his metaphysical\nwork, the De summo bono; Hugh Ripelin of Stra\u00dfburg\n(c.1200 \u2013 1268) who wrote the famous Compendium theologicae\nveritatis; John of Freiburg (c.1250 \u2013 1314) who wrote the\nLibellus de quaestionibus casualibus; and Giles of Lessines\n(c. 1230 \u2013 c. 1304) who wrote a treatise on the unity of\nsubstantial form, the De unitate formae. The influence of\nAlbert and his students was very pronounced in the generation of\nGerman scholars who came after these men. Dietrich of Freiberg, who\nmay have actually met Albert, is probably the best example of the\ninfluence of the spirit of Albert the Great. Dietrich (c. 1250 \u2013\nc. 1310) wrote treatises on natural science, which give evidence of\nhis having carried out actual scientific investigation. His treatise\non the rainbow would be a good example. But he also wrote treatises on\nmetaphysical and theological topics in which the echoes of Albert can\nbe distinctly heard. Unlike Albert he did not write commentaries on\nAristotle, but preferred to apply Albertist principles to topics\naccording to his own understanding. On the other hand Berthold of\nMoosburg (+ c. 1361) wrote a very important commentary on Proclus\u2019\nElements of Theology, introducing the major work of the great\nNeo-Platonist into German metaphysics. Berthold\u2019s debt to Albert is\nfound throughout his commentary, especially with regard to\nmetaphysical topics. Many of these Albertist ideas and principles\npassed down to thinkers such as Meister Eckhart, John Tauler, and\nHeinrich Suso where they took on a unique mystical flavor. The\nAlbertist tradition continued down to Heymeric de Campo (1395 \u2013\n1460) who passed it on to Nicholas of Cusa. From Nicholas the ideas\npass down to the Renaissance. The philosophers of the Renaissance seem\nto have been attracted to the Albert\u2019s understanding of Neo-Platonism\nand his interest in natural science.\n",
