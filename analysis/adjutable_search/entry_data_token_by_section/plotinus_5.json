    "main_text": "Principal Opponents\n6. Influence\n\n Porphyry\u2019s edition of Plotinus\u2019 Enneads preserved for\nposterity the works of the leading Platonic interpreter of antiquity.\nThrough these works as well as through the writings of Porphyry\nhimself (234 \u2013 c. 305 C.E.) and Iamblichus (c. 245\u2013325\nC.E.), Plotinus shaped the entire subsequent history of philosophy.\nUntil well into the 19th century, Platonism was in large\npart understood, appropriated or rejected based on its Plotinian\nexpression and in adumbrations of this.\n\n The theological traditions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all,\nin their formative periods, looked to ancient Greek philosophy for the\nlanguage and arguments with which to articulate their religious\nvisions.  For all of these, Platonism expressed the philosophy that\nseemed closest to their own theologies.  Plotinus was the principal\nsource for their understanding of Platonism.\n\n Through the Latin translation of Plotinus by Marsilio Ficino\npublished in 1492, Plotinus became available to the West. The first\nEnglish translation, by Thomas Taylor, appeared in the late\n18th century.  Plotinus was, once again, recognized as the\nmost authoritative interpreter of Platonism.  In the writings of the\nItalian Renaissance philosophers, the 15th and\n16th century humanists John Colet, Erasmus of Rotterdam,\nand Thomas More, the 17th century Cambridge Platonists, and\nGerman idealists, especially Hegel, Plotinus\u2019 thought was the\n(sometimes unacknowledged) basis for opposition to the competing and\nincreasingly influential tradition of scientific philosophy.  This\ninfluence continued in the 20th century flowering of\nChristian imaginative literature in England, including the works of\nC.S. Lewis and Charles Williams. \n",
