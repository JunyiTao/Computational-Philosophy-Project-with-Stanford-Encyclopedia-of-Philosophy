    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || John Locke\n3.2 John Locke\n\nJohn Locke in the second of his Two Treatises of Government\n(1689) emphasized the importance of governance through\n\u201cestablished standing Laws, promulgated and known to the\nPeople\u201d. He contrasted this with rule by \u201cextemporary\nArbitrary Decrees\u201d (Locke 1689: \u00a7\u00a7135\u20137). Now\nthe term \u201carbitrary\u201d can mean many different things.\nSometimes it means \u201coppressive\u201d. But when Locke\ndistinguished the rule of settled standing laws from arbitrary\ndecrees, it was not the oppressive sense of \u201carbitrary\u201d\nthat he had in mind. In this context, something is arbitrary because\nit is extemporary: there is no notice of it; the ruler just figures it\nout as he goes along. It is the arbitrariness of unpredictability, not\nknowing what you can rely on, being subject, as Locke put it (1689:\n\u00a7137), to someone\u2019s \n\n\nsudden thoughts, or unrestrain\u2019d, and till that moment unknown\nWills without having any measures set down which may guide and\njustifie their actions. \n\n\nIn Locke\u2019s story, one of the things that people wanted to get\naway from in the state of nature was being subject to others\u2019\nincalculable opinions\u2014even when those others were thinking as\nhard and rigorously as they could about natural law. Your thinking\nmight be different from my thinking, and it might turn out that your\nview of the relation between your interests and my interests and your\nproperty and my interests might be quite different from my view of the\nmatter and quite different again from the view of the next person I\ncame across. The whole point of moving from a state of nature to a\nsituation of positive law was to introduce some predictability into\nthis picture.\n\nUnfortunately, having laid down this requirement, Locke complicated\nmatters by adding a substantive principle of respect for private\nproperty: \u201cThe Supream Power cannot take from any Man any part\nof his Property without his own consent\u201d, and any law that\npurports to do so is of no validity (Locke 1689: \u00a7138). But then\nthere is a difficulty. Though Locke gave us his own theory of\nprepolitical property rights\u2014the so-called \u201cLabor\nTheory\u201d in Chapter Five of the Second Treatise\u2014it\nwas itself far from uncontroversial. People in our day, as in his,\ndisagree about the rival claims of labor and occupancy; they disagree\nabout the background of common ownership; and they disagree about how\nmuch anyone may appropriate and how sensitive his appropriation must\nbe to the needs of others. We disagree about all that\u2014in ways\nthat were made evident, for example, in the debates about the Lockean\ntheory of Robert Nozick (1974). And Locke and his contemporaries\ndisagreed too; Locke knew, and signaled in a number of places that he\nknew just how controversial all this was (Tully 1980: 64 ff; for\nLocke\u2019s awareness of the controversies, see Waldron 1999:\n74\u20135).\n\nBy insisting therefore that positive law is subject to this\nsubstantive constraint, Locke subjected the legislature to a\ndiscipline of uncertainty. Because the natural right of property was\ncontroversial, so the administration of any substantive constraint\nalong these lines was bound to be controversial. And because the\nsubstantive constraint was supposed to affect the validity of positive\nlaw (Locke 1689: \u00a7135), the effect would be that some\npeople\u2014let\u2019s say those who disagreed with Locke about the\nclaims of labor over occupancy\u2014would disagree with him about\nwhich positive rules of property are valid and which are not. \n",
