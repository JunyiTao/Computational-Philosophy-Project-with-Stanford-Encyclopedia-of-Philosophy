    "main_text": "Arguments against computationalism || Limits of computational modeling\n7.3 Limits of computational modeling\n Could a computer compose the Eroica symphony? Or discover\ngeneral relativity? Or even replicate a child\u2019s effortless\nability to perceive the environment, tie her shoelaces, and discern\nthe emotions of others? Intuitive, creative, or skillful human\nactivity may seem to resist formalization by a computer program\n(Dreyfus 1972, 1992). More generally, one might worry that crucial\naspects of human cognition elude computational modeling, especially\nclassical computational modeling.\nIronically, Fodor promulgates a forceful version of this\ncritique. Even in his earliest statements of CCTM, Fodor (1975:\n197\u2013205) expresses considerable skepticism that CCTM can handle\nall important cognitive phenomena. The pessimism becomes more\npronounced in his later writings (1983, 2000), which focus especially\non abductive reasoning as a mental phenomenon that\npotentially eludes computational modeling. His core argument may be\nsummarized as follows:\n\n(1)Turing-style\ncomputation is sensitive only to \u201clocal\u201d properties of a\nmental representation, which are exhausted by the identity and\narrangement of the representation\u2019s constituents.\n(2)Many mental\nprocesses, paradigmatically abduction, are sensitive to\n\u201cnonlocal\u201d properties such as relevance, simplicity, and\nconservatism.\n(3)Hence, we may have\nto abandon Turing-style modeling of the relevant\nprocesses.\n(4)Unfortunately, we\nhave currently have no idea what alternative theory might serve as a\nsuitable replacement.\n\nSome critics deny (1), arguing that suitable Turing-style\ncomputations can be sensitive to \u201cnonlocal\u201d properties\n(Schneider 2011; Wilson 2005). Some challenge (2), arguing that\ntypical abductive inferences are sensitive only to \u201clocal\u201d\nproperties (Carruthers 2003; Ludwig and Schneider 2008; Sperber\n2002). Some concede step (3) but dispute step (4), insisting that we\nhave promising non-Turing-style models of the relevant mental\nprocesses (Pinker 2005). Partly spurred by such criticisms, Fodor\nelaborates his argument in considerable detail. To defend (2), he\ncritiques theories that model abduction by deploying\n\u201clocal\u201d heuristic algorithms (2005: 41\u201346; 2008:\n115\u2013126) or by positing a profusion of domain-specific cognitive\nmodules (2005: 56\u2013100). To defend (4), he critiques various\ntheories that handle abduction through non-Turing-style models (2000:\n46\u201353; 2008), such as connectionist networks.\nThe scope and limits of computational modeling remain\ncontroversial. We may expect this topic to remain an active focus of\ninquiry, pursued jointly with AI.\n",
