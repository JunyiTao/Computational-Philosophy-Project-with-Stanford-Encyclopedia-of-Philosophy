    "main_text": "The Rights of Women || A Bold Defense of Women\u2019s Rights\n4.3 Appraising Condorcet\u2019s Stance\n\nThere is no question that Condorcet advanced some of the age\u2019s most\ncompelling claims on behalf of women, which were in turn part of his\ndeep-seated commitment to individual liberty and social equality. In\nclosing his brief for female citizenship, he challenges his critics to\n\u201cshow me a natural difference between men and women on which the\nexclusion could legitimately be based\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994,\n339). Yet even this advocate of reason and sexual equality introduces\nan asymmetry between the sexes, and he locates that disproportion\ndirectly on the reproductive and maternal body of woman. Despite his\nobjection to the argument of natural difference, Condorcet allows that\nsexual differences would still continue to have social effects within\na more rationally organized society. However, he indicates his\nawareness of the persuasive attacks by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other\nlike-minded reformers on the very widely practiced custom of\nwet-nursing the infants and toddlers of the better classes, as well as\nthe same reformers\u2019 complaints against the vanity and egotism of women\nwho employed wet-nurses (see Landes 1988, chapter 3). Therefore, it is\nvery likely that Condorcet\u2019s reassurances are meant not just for men\nbut also for women. At this point in time public opinion was clearly\nturning against any woman who would willingly choose to neglect her\ndomestic duties or altogether disavow them, especially should she do\nso for either social or strictly selfish reasons. Although Rousseau\nand others did insist on fathers taking a greater involvement and\nresponsibility towards their families, none of this was meant to\nrelieve a woman of her primary domestic role or its attendant burdens.\nIf anything, reformers insisted on both parents simply doing more in\nfamily life while preserving the sexual division of labor.\n\nIn his defense, however, it is clear that until the tragic end of his\nlife, Condorcet never relinquished the notion that a woman not only\ncan but also must prepare vocationally for her own independence. In\nhis Testament he advises his infant daughter to \u201cget\ninto the habit of working so that you are self-sufficient and need no\nexternal help \u2026 though you may become poor, you will never\nbecome dependent on others\u201d. And such work should not be routine\nor menial: \u201cchoose a type of work which does not occupy the\nhands alone, but engages the mind without straining; something which\ncompensates your efforts by the pleasure it gives you\u201d (McLean\nand Hewitt 1994, 284). Coming from the titled aristocracy, for whom\nthe idea of a woman\u2019s paid employment might have seemed inappropriate,\nif not bizarre, this is remarkable advice. But Condorcet insists that\nhis daughter be prepared for all circumstances. In the sad prospect of\nthe compounding loss of her mother as well as her father, he asks her\nguardians to prepare his daughter for a great deal more than\n\u201cthe usual ladylike accomplishments\u201d, advising: \u201cI\nshould like my daughter to learn to draw, to paint and to engrave well\nenough to be able to earn a living without too much difficulty or\nrepugnance. I should like her to learn to read and to speak\nEnglish\u201d (McLean and Hewitt 1994, 290). Likewise, in the tenth\nstage of the progress for the human mind in his Esquisse, he\nboldly affirms that\n\n\namong the causes of the progress of the human mind of the human mind\nthat are of the utmost importance to the general happiness, we must\nnumber the complete annihilation of the prejudices that have brought\nabout an inequality of rights between the sexes, an inequality fatal\neven to the party in whose favour it works. (Condorcet 1955 [orig.\n1795], 193)\n\n\nIn sum, just as tyranny in the political order disfigures the tyrants\nas much as their victims, Condorcet believes that men will be\ninfinitely better off once they accept the full equality of women.\n\nIndeed, a great deal of the ambivalence that one detects in\nCondorcet\u2019s 1790 essay belongs to the times, not merely in the sense\nof the day\u2019s prejudices\u2014which, as we have seen, he strongly\ncombated\u2014but rather also with respect to the extent to which the\nopportunity for achieving women\u2019s rights was eclipsed by an\nincreasingly negative, even openly hostile climate toward women who\nwere perceived to be overly \u201cpublic\u201d and insufficiently\nmodest and \u201cdomestic\u201d. In the face of women\u2019s heightened\npolitical involvement during the popular revolution, those few\nrepresentatives still favoring political equality for women appear to\nhave retracted their former support. Despite his pronounced early and\nvisible commitment to women\u2019s voting rights, Condorcet\u2019s public\nsilence on the issue when presenting his introductory report on the\ndraft constitution to the Convention in 1793 still remains perplexing.\nThe constitutional debate occurred after the removal of the\ndistinction between passive and active voters, so that the denial of\nwomen\u2019s rights was made more explicitly than ever a matter of sexual\ndifference rather than one of property or class position. In addition,\nfrom the declaration of the Republic in September 1792 until women\u2019s\npolitical participation was proscribed by the deputies of the\nConvention in the fall of 1793, popular women\u2019s activism in the\nstreets and in the galleries of the Convention was accelerating, but\nso too was a campaign against women in the revolutionary press. (On\nthis period, see especially Levy, et al. 1979 and Godineau 1998).\n\nAlthough Condorcet remained silent, others among his friends and\npolitical allies spoke up. The Welsh-born naturalized French citizen\nDavid Williams\u2014friend of the Girondins, participant in Sophie de\nCondorcet\u2019s salon, author of Lettres sur la libert\u00e9\npolitique [Letters on Political Liberty], and participant in the\npreparatory work for the Constitution\u2014wrote his Observations\nsur la derni\u00e8re constitution (Observations on the Last\nConstitution] (published 1793 in Paris). Williams supported education\nfor women, their right to testify in cases involving members of their\nown sex, and political rights for single women, spinsters as well as\nwidows. Moreover, an appeal for women\u2019s voting rights by deputy Pierre\nGuyomar entitled le Partisan de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des droits\net de l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 en fait [The Partisan of the\nEquality of Rights and Inequality in Fact] was discussed by the\nconstitutional draft commission. Guyomar seemingly draws upon\nCondorcet, comparing prejudice in sexual matters to those of race, and\ncalls for its outright abolition. And like Condorcet (and the authors\nof the 1789 \u201cLadies\u2019 Request\u201d), he points to the\nnation\u2019s outright hypocrisy, where the Declaration of Rights serves to\nperpetuate an aristocracy of men and smuggle in old r\u00e9gime\nprinciples. However, the weight of official opinion did not support\nthe inclusion of women into full citizenship. The Commission concluded\nin April 1793 that women lacked sufficient education to participate in\nthe nation\u2019s political life (see Roudinesco 1991,\n 129\u2013130).[18]\n By the fall of 1793, women would also be barred from participating in\nclubs and societies. Women in France would not achieve the ballot\nuntil 1944, and many of the advancements in civil law passed in the\n1790s were withdrawn by Napoleon, and not again fully secured until\nthe last half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn a sense, French women\u2019s lives were shaped almost entirely for far\ntoo long by the very institution against which Condorcet protested.\nIronically, this devoted father and husband was perhaps the only\nphilosophe who never kept a mistress, yet he was arguably\n\n\nthe one most critical of the family, as this institution was known in\nthe eighteenth century. The indissoluble character that the Church had\nconferred upon marriage appeared to him as a veritable seedbed of such\nevils as adultery, prostitution, and bastardy. (Rowe, in Rosenfield\n1984, 25)\n\n\nHe advocated for birth control, woman\u2019s right to plan her pregnancy\nsensibly, and for a man\u2019s obligation to his child\u2019s welfare after\nbirth. He envisioned a better future for illegitimate children and\nsupported opportunities for unmarried pregnant women to have their\nchildren without social penalties (Condorcet 1968, VI: 256\u20139,\nVIII: 465\u2013466; Williams 2004, 168\u2013169; Schapiro 1963,\n192\u2013193). He proposed occupational training rather than\nincarceration for prostitutes, opposed police harassment of\nprostitutes and homosexuals, and denounced barbaric laws and practices\nagainst homosexuals, such as France\u2019s burning of homosexuals alive and\nthe English resort to mob violence (Condorcet 1968, VIII:\n469\u201370, IV: 561; Schapiro 1963, 192\u2013195; Williams 2004,\n170). In the Esquisse he advocated for making marriage a\ncivil not a religious contract, as was formally accomplished by his\nfellow republicans in France during the 1790s. He upbraided the\ndespotic role of parents in arranging their children\u2019s marriage. He\nfavored divorce, and considered the manner in which child custody and\neducation should be protected in its event. In the place of what he\nconsidered the private despotism of family life in old r\u00e9gime\nFrance, and with the hope for women\u2019s expanded independence, Condorcet\nenvisioned the coming into being of more loving and egalitarian\nunions, much like the one he fashioned with his wife:\n\n\nEverything which can contribute to rendering individuals more\nindependent also increases the happiness they can reciprocally bestow\nupon each other; their happiness will be greater when the individual\naction is more voluntary. (Biblioth\u00e8que nationale ms. N.a. fr\n4586, fol. 18, cited and translated in Manuel 1962, 99)\n\n\nHad he lived longer, he would have seen many disappointments, watching\nas so many of the early Revolution\u2019s legislated reforms in marital and\npersonal life, as well as the whole panoply of human rights for which\nhe fought, were retracted, modified or suspended, and while political\nparticipation was crushed under the Directory and more emphatically\nunder Napoleon\u2019s rule. After his death, Condorcet was not entirely\nforgotten, and his contribution was honored throughout the nineteenth\ncentury in France, Britain, and elsewhere by those men and women who\nfought to bring down the refortified barriers to women\u2019s rights that\nwere paradoxically imposed by democrats and republicans who otherwise\nsaw themselves as liberal opponents of preceding regimes.\n",
