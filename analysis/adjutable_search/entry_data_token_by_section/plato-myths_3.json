But since\nothers may sometimes not follow his arguments, Plato is ready to\nprovide whatever it takes\u2014an image, a simile, or a\nmyth\u2014that will help them grasp what the argument failed to tell\nthem. The myth\u2014just like an image, or analogy\u2014may be a\ngood teaching tool. Myth can embody in its narrative an abstract\nphilosophical doctrine. In the Phaedo, Plato develops the\nso-called theory of recollection (72e\u201378b). The theory is there\nexpounded in rather abstract terms. The eschatological myth of the\nPhaedo depicts the fate of souls in the other world, but it\ndoes not \u201cdramatize\u201d the theory of recollection. The\nPhaedrus myth of the winged soul, however, does. In it we are\ntold how the soul travels in the heavens before reincarnation,\nattempts to gaze on true reality, forgets what it saw in the heavens\nonce reincarnated, and then recalls the eternal forms it saw in the\nheavens when looking at their perceptible embodiments. The\nPhaedrus myth does not provide any proofs or evidence to\nsupport the theory of recollection. It simply assumes this theory to\nbe true and provides (among other things) an \u201cadaptation\u201d\nof it. Since this theory the myth embodies is, for Plato, true, the\nmyth has (pace Plato) a measure of truth in it, although its many\nfantastical details may lead one astray if taken literally. Among\nother things, the fantastical narrative of the myth helps the less\nphilosophically inclined grasp the main point of Plato\u2019s theory\nof recollection, namely that \u201cknowledge is\nrecollection\u201d.\n",
