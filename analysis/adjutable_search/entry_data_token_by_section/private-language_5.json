    "main_text": "The Private Language Argument Expounded || The Central Argument\n3.2 The Central Argument\n\nWittgenstein points out in the diary case \u2018I first want to\nobserve that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated\u2019.\n(The translation here obscures the reason why. Wittgenstein\u2019s word is\n\u2018aussprechen\u2019, better translated as\n\u2018expressed\u2019 than \u2018formulated\u2019: the point\nfollows by definition from the fact that the case is one where the\ndefinition is private.) So if meaning is to be obtained for the\n\u201csign\u201d, this must be achieved through a private exercise\nof ostensive definition, where I concentrate on the sensation and\nproduce the sign at the same time. (In these circumstances, meaning\ncannot be extracted from a pre-existing practice of private use, since\nwhat is in question is how such a use could be established in the\nfirst place.) But if this exercise is to be genuine and successful\nostensive definition, it must establish the connection\nbetween sign and sensation, and this connection must persist.\nAs Wittgenstein says, \u2018\u201cI commit [the connection] to\nmemory\u201d can only mean: this process brings it about that I\nremember the connection correctly in the future\u2019. For I\ndo not define anything, even to myself let alone anyone else, by\nmerely attending to something and making a mark, unless this episode\nhas the appropriate consequences.\n",
