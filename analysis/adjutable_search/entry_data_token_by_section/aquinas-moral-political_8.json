    "main_text": "Practical reason\u2019s first principles || Known by (or from) inclination?\n2.6 Known by (or from) inclination?\n\nMany modern accounts of Aquinas\u2019 theory of natural law give\nexplanatory primacy to the naturalness of the inclinations (to live,\nto know, etc.) that correspond to these basic goods. But others regard\nthis as a fundamental misunderstanding of Aquinas\u2019 conception of\nwill, and of the epistemological relationship between nature and\nreason. Will is for him intelligent response to intelligible good:\none\u2019s will is \u201cin\u201d one\u2019s reason [voluntas\nin ratione]. He makes it very explicit both that human actions\nare rightly said to be natural (in the morally relevant sense of\n\u201cnatural\u201d) when and because they are intelligent and\nreasonable (ST I-II q. 71 a. 2), and that there are\ninclinations which are natural, in the sense that they are commonly\nfound or characterize some or even most individuals, yet are unnatural\nbecause lacking any intelligibly good object. So explanatory priority\nmust be accorded to the basic human goods themselves, and to the\nself-evident desirability which makes each of them the object of an\ninclination in the will of anyone sufficiently intelligent and mature\nto understand their goodness (that is, the way they make human beings\nmore fulfilled, more \u201cperfect\u201d [complete]). An inclination\nof that kind is relevant in practical reason because its object is\ndesirable, and desirable because it would contribute to anyone\u2019s\nflourishing. To say this is not to say that our natural inclinations\nto what contributes to our flourishing are mere accident or\nhappenstance.\n",
