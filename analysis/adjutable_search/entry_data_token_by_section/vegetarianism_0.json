Terminology and Overview of Positions\n\nMoral vegetarianism is opposed by moral omnivorism, the view according\nto which it is permissible to consume meat (and also animal products,\nfungi, plants, etc.). \n\nMoral veganism accepts moral vegetarianism and adds to it that\nconsuming animal products is wrong. Whereas in everyday life,\n\u201cvegetarianism\u201d and \u201cveganism\u201d include claims\nabout what one may eat, in this entry, the claims are simply\nabout what one may not eat. They agree that animals are among those\nthings.\n\nIn this entry, \u201canimals\u201d is used to refer to non-human\nanimals. For the most part, the animals discussed are the land animals\nfarmed for food in the West, especially cattle, chicken, and pigs.\nThere will be some discussion of insects and fish but none of dogs,\ndolphins, or whales.\n\nPrimarily, this entry concerns itself with whether moral vegetarians\nare correct that eating meat is wrong. Secondarily\u2014but\nat greater length\u2014it concerns itself with whether the\nproduction of meat is permissible.\n\nPrimarily, this entry concerns itself with eating in times of\nabundance and abundant choices. Moral vegans need not argue that it is\nwrong to eat an egg if that is the only way to save your life. Moral\nvegetarians need not argue it is wrong to eat seal meat if that is the\nonly food for miles. Moral omnivores need not argue it is permissible\nto eat the family dog. These cases raise important issues, but the\narguments in this entry are not about them.\n\nAlmost exclusively, the entry concerns itself with contemporary\n arguments.[1]\n Strikingly, many historical arguments and most contemporary arguments\nagainst the permissibility of eating meat start with premises about\nthe wrongness of producing meat and move to conclusions about\nthe wrongness of consuming it. That is, they argue that\n\n\nIt is wrong to eat meat\n\n\nBy first arguing that\n\n\nIt is wrong to produce meat.\n\n\nThe claim about production is the topic of \u00a72.\n",
