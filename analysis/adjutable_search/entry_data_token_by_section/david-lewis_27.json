    "main_text": "Other Writings || Ethics\n7.6 Applied Metaphysics\n\nThere\u2019s much more that could be said about Lewis\u2019s\ncontributions to philosophy, but we\u2019ll end with a discussion of\ntwo wonderful pieces of applied metaphysics.\n\nIn \u201cThe Paradoxes of Time Travel\u201d (1976d), Lewis discusses\nthe many complicated philosophical issues about\n time travel.\n He discusses\n temporal parts,\n personal identity, causation and causal loops, free will, and the\ncomplications arising from our many different modal concepts. In some\ncases he uses the canvas provided to illustrate his own take on the\nmetaphysical issues that arise. But in some cases he notes that the\nproblems that arise are problems for everyone.\n\n\u201cHoles\u201d (Lewis and Lewis 1970) was co-written with\nStephanie Lewis. In it they discuss, in dialog form, some of the\nmetaphysical issues that holes generate. One of the characters, Argle,\nwants to eliminate holes from his ontology, and the paper goes over\nwhat costs must be met to make this form of\n nominalism\n work. The other character, Bargle, pushes Argle to clarify his\ncommitments, and in doing so draws out many details of the nominalist\nframework. The case is of some interest in itself, but it is also, as\nthe authors note at the end, a useful case-study in the kind of moves\nnominalists can make in eliminating unwanted ontology, and the costs\nof those moves.\n\nEach paper can be, and indeed often has been, used for introducing\ncomplicated metaphysical issues to students. The papers are, like many\nof Lewis\u2019s papers, widely anthologised. They are both excellent\nillustrations of the fact that, as well as being a wonderful\nphilosopher, Lewis was one of the best philosophical writers of his\ntime.\n",
