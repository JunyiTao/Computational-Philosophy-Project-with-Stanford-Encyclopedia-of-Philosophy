    "main_text": "The normativity of need || Needs and Moral Obligation\n1.2 Needs and Moral Obligation\n\n\nConsider next the alleged normative force of need claims. They are\noften singled out for discussion because on the one hand whether\nsomebody has a need seems to be a matter of fact, while on the other\nthe existence of the need once established seems to constitute a\nreason for acting so as to fulfil it. If John, who has a migraine,\nneeds a painkiller (matter of fact), then I have a reason to give him\none (normative reason). So needs serve as a bridge between\n\u2018is\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019. Yet leaving aside general\ndoubts as to whether such bridge-building is possible, we need to\ntread cautiously here. First, the thesis is only plausible in the case\nof categorical needs. In the case of instrumental needs, everything\nwill turn on the end for which the needed item is required. An\narsonist may need a match to start a fire, but there is no reason to\nhand him one. Second, even categorical needs only provide reasons for\naction when the need is presently unfulfilled. So we need to draw a\ndistinction between \u2018occurrent\u2019 and\n\u2018dispositional\u2019 needs (Thomson 1987, 11\u201312;\nReader 2007, 71). A dispositional need is a general need that human\nbeings have, like the need for sleep. But whether a person has an\noccurrent need for sleep depends on whether he has just woken up after\na good night\u2019s rest or on the contrary has been unable to sleep\nfor the last twenty-four hours. It is only in the latter case, where\nthe need is occurrent, that others have a reason to meet it by\noffering the sleep-deprived person a bed to lie on.\n\n\nWhat kinds of reason for action do basic needs create? Needs are\nsometimes described as \u2018morally demanding\u2019, and therefore\nas directly generating moral obligations on the part of those who can\nfulfil them (Reader 2007, chs. 4\u20136). But what kind of\nobligation? Some philosophers writing in defence of care ethics take\nresponding to need as the paradigm case of, or even definitive of, a\ncaring relationship. For Bubeck, for example, \u2018caring for is the\nmeeting of the needs of one person by another person where\nface-to-face interaction between carer and cared for is a crucial\nelement of the overall activity and where the need is of such a nature\nthat it cannot possibly be met by the person in need herself\u2019\n(Bubeck 1995, 129). This is echoed by Held (2006, 10):\n\u2018the central focus of the ethics of care is on the compelling\nmoral salience of attending to and meeting the needs of the particular\nothers for whom we take responsibility\u2019. However it would be a\nmistake to think that needs only have moral relevance in the context\nof caring relationships, even if it is within those relationships that\nthey can be responded to most fully. For meeting needs is also\nsometimes demanded as a matter of justice: we explore the relationship\nbetween needs and justice more fully in section 4 below. We can see\nthis most clearly in circumstances where resources are not plentiful\nenough to meet everyone\u2019s needs in full. Then we face the\nproblem of how to distribute them, and the principle we use to solve\nit will be a principle of justice.  \u2018To each according to their\nneeds\u2019 has over the last two centuries often been held up as the\nhighest principle of distributive justice, although as we shall see in\nsection 5 there are a number of different ways in which the\nrequirement to distribute scarce resources\naccording to need can be interpreted. Those who want to\ndefend the supremacy of care as a moral value acknowledge that justice\nof this kind must have a place within caring relationships (Held 2006,\nch. 4). The caring parent, for instance, must pay equal attention\nto the various different needs of each of his or her children.\n",
