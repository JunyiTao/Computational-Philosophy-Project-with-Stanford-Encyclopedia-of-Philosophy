Cognitive perspectives on discovery\n\nThe approaches to scientific discovery presented in the previous\nsections focus on the adoption, articulation, and preliminary\nevaluation of ideas or hypotheses prior to rigorous testing, not on\nhow a novel hypothesis or idea is first thought up. For a long time,\nthe predominant view among philosophers of discovery was that the\ninitial step of discovery is a mysterious intuitive leap of the human\nmind that cannot be analyzed further. More recent accounts of\ndiscovery informed by evolutionary biology also do not explicate how\nnew ideas are formed. The generation of new ideas is akin to random,\nblind variations of thought processes, which have to be inspected by\nthe critical mind and assessed as neutral, productive, or useless\n(Campbell 1960; see also Hull 1988), but the key processes by which\nnew ideas are generated are left unanalyzed.\n\nWith the recent rapprochement among philosophy of mind, cognitive\nscience and psychology and the increased integration of empirical\nresearch into philosophy of science, these processes have been\nsubmitted to closer analysis, and philosophical studies of creativity\nhave seen a surge of interest (e.g. Paul & Kaufman 2014a). The\ndistinctive feature of these studies is that they integrate\nphilosophical analyses with empirical work from cognitive science,\npsychology, evolutionary biology, and computational neuroscience\n(Thagard 2012). Analysts have distinguished different kinds and\ndifferent features of creative thinking and have examined certain\nfeatures in depth, and from new angles. Recent philosophical research\non creativity comprises conceptual analyses and integrated approaches\nbased on the assumption that creativity can be analyzed and\nthat empirical research can contribute to the analysis (Paul &\nKaufman 2014b). Two key elements of the cognitive processes involved\nin creative thinking that have been in the focus of philosophical\nanalysis are analogies\n (section 9.2)\n and mental models\n (section 9.3).\n",
