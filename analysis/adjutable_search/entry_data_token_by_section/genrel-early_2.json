    "main_text": "Machian Positivism || A \u201cRelativization of Inertia\u201d?\n2.2 A \u201cRelativization of Inertia\u201d?\n\nMachian influences specific to the general theory of relativity\nappeared even more extensive. Mach\u2019s id\u00e9e fixe,\nthat a body\u2019s inertial mass and motion result from the influence\nof all other surrounding masses (thus eliminating the\n\u201cmonstrous\u201d Newtonian concept of absolute space), was\nperhaps the strongest motivation guiding Einstein\u2019s pursuit of a\nrelativistic theory of gravity. In papers leading up to the definitive\npresentation of the general theory of relativity in 1916, Einstein\nmade no secret of the fact that Mach was the inspiration for an\nepistemologically mandated attempt to generalize the principle of\nrelativity. Holding, with Mach, that no observable facts could be\nassociated with the notions of absolute acceleration or\nabsolute inertia (i.e., resistance to acceleration), the\ngeneralization required that the laws of nature be completely\nindependent of the state of motion of any chosen reference system. In\nfact, in striving to completely relativize inertia, Einstein conflated\na valid principle of form invariance of the laws of nature (general\ncovariance, see below) with a spurious \u201cprinciple of general\nrelativity\u201d, according to which accelerated motions like\nrotations would be relative to an observer\u2019s state of motion. In\na warm obituary of Mach written within a few days of completing the\ndefinitive 1916 presentation of his theory, Einstein, quoting\nextensively from the famous passages in Mach\u2019s\nMechanics critical of Newton\u2019s \u201cabsolute\u201d\nconcepts of space, time and motion, generously avowed that\nMach\u2019s understanding of the principles of mechanics had brought\nhim very close to demanding a general theory of relativity a\nhalf-century earlier (1916b: 102\u20133). No doubt with this\nreference in mind, physicist Phillip Frank, later to be associated\nwith the Vienna Circle, observed that\n\n\nit is universally known today that Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity grew immediately out of the positivistic doctrine of space\nand motion. (1917 [1949: 68])\n\n\nBut, as noted above, there are both genuine and specious aspects\nconnected with Einstein\u2019s \u201cprinciple of general\nrelativity\u201d, a mixture complicated by Einstein\u2019s own\npuzzling remarks regarding the principle of general covariance.\n",
