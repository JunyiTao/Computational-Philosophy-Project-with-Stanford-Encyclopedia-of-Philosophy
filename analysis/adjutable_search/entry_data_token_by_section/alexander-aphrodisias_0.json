    "main_text": "Life and Works || Date, Family, Teachers, and Influence\n1.1 Date, Family, Teachers, and Influence\n\nNext to nothing is known about Alexander\u2019s origin, life circumstances,\nand career. His native city was (probably) the Aphrodisias in Caria,\nan inland city of southwestern Asia Minor. His father\u2019s name was\nHermias. The only direct information about his date and activities is\nthe dedication of his On Fate to the emperors Septimius\nSeverus and Caracalla in gratitude for his appointment to an endowed\nchair. Their co-reign lasted from 198 to 209 CE; this gives us a rough\ndate for at least one of Alexander\u2019s works. Nothing is known about his\nbackground or his education, except that his teacher was Aristoteles\nof Mytilene, rather than the more famous Aristocles of Messene, as had\nbeen conjectured by certain scholars since the 16th. century. He is\nalso said to have been a student of Sosigenes and of Herminus, the\npupil of the commentator Aspasius, the earliest commentator on\nAristotle whose work has in part survived (for information concerning\nAlexander\u2019s teachers and their philosophy, see Moraux 1984, 335\u2013425).\nHow much Alexander owed to his teachers is hard to guess, for he\nsometimes criticizes Sosigenes and Herminus extensively. But it is\nclear from the scope and depth of his work that he was a well-trained\nphilosopher with a broad range of knowledge and interests.\n\nThough the dedication to the emperors tells us that Alexander was\nappointed to a chair in philosophy, there is not sufficient evidence\nas to whether, as is often asserted, he obtained one of the four\nchairs, representing the four traditional schools, established in\nAthens by Marcus Aurelius in 176 CE. There were similar established\nchairs in several cities (on Athens see Lynch 1972, 192\u2013207;\n213\u2013216). Given the amount and scope of his writing he must have\nbeen an active teacher with a flourishing school. It is therefore\npossible that some of the short essays attributed to Alexander are\nactually the production of one of his collaborators or disciples. But\nnothing is known about any of his associates and students (cf.\nSharples 1990a). To us his work therefore represents both the heyday\nand the end of the series of commentators who explained Aristotle\nexclusively on the basis of Aristotelian texts, without commitment to\nsome other doctrine. Alexander concludes the series of these purely\n\u2018Peripatetic\u2019 commentators (beginning with Andronicus of\nRhodes in the first century BCE), who try to explain \u201cAristotle\nby Aristotle\u201d (Moraux 1942, xvi). Though later commentators,\nstarting with Porphyry, the disciple and editor of Plotinus, relied\nheavily on his works, they had a Neo-Platonist approach. Since\nPorphyry lived considerably later than Alexander (ca. 234\u2013305/10\nCE), Alexander\u2019s school may have continued to exist until it became\noutmoded by the \u2018Neo-Platonist turn\u2019. Porphyry\u2019s report\nthat Plotinus included texts by Alexander \u2018and related authors\nin his discussions\u2019 (The Life of Plotinus, 14.13) makes\nthis quite likely. Alexander\u2019s commentaries formed a central part of\nthe Arabic tradition and was heavily used by Maimonides. It thereby\ninfluenced the Latin West after the revival of Aristotelianism in the\nMiddle Ages. The scarcity of Latin translations of Alexander\u2019s\ncommentaries suggests a certain preference for the interpretation of\nthe later, Neoplatonist, commentators. If William of Moerbeke confined\nhis translations of Alexander\u2019s commentaries to those on the\nMeteorologica and the De sensu that may in part be\ndue to the availability of Boethius\u2019 commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s\nPrior Analytics and the Topics, but it leaves\nunexplained why he did not translate the commentary on the\nMetaphysics. \n",
