    "main_text": "Some ancient Greek views || Stoic views of character\n2.5 Stoic views of character\n\nThe Stoic school of philosophy existed for about five centuries, from\nits founding around 300 BCE to the second century CE. Like Socrates,\nPlato, and Aristotle, the Stoic philosophers differed on some issues\nabout the virtues, but they seemed also to have shared a common core\nof views. This section of the entry on character will briefly discuss\ntheir common views.\n\nThe Stoic philosophers have a view of character that is close to\nSocrates\u2019, but they reach it through agreement with Aristotle.\nThe Stoics assume that the good life for human beings is a life in\naccord with nature. They agree with Aristotle that the human\nbeing\u2019s essence is a life in accord with reason. So to find what\naccords with nature, they look to the development of the human\nbeing\u2019s rational powers. They think that as a person begins to\nuse reason instrumentally to satisfy and organize his desires and\nappetites, he comes to value the exercise of reason for its own sake.\nHe realizes that conduct that exhibits a rational order is far more\nvaluable than any of the natural advantages (such as health,\nfriendship, or community) pursued by his individual actions. Human\ngood, after all, as Aristotle argued, should be stable, under our\ncontrol, and hard to take from us. The Stoics conclude that human good\nconsists in excellent rational activity, for a person can guide his\nactions by rational choice, no matter what misfortunes he may\nencounter. The virtuous person becomes the sage (sophos) who\nhas and acts on knowledge of the good. His actions are informed by his\ninsights about the advantages of perfecting one\u2019s rationality by\nacting in agreement with the rational order of nature. Like Socrates,\nthe Stoic view of virtue focuses on the virtuous person\u2019s\ncognitive state: it is his knowledge of the rational order of the\nuniverse and his desire to accord with that rational order that leads\nhim to act as he does.\n\nTo be virtuous, there is no need to develop any capacities other than\ncognitive capacities, for the Stoics claim against Plato and Aristotle\nthat there is really no non-rational part of the soul. Although the\nStoics admit that there are passions such as anger, fear, and so on,\nthey treat them as mistaken judgments about what is good and evil.\nSince the sage or virtuous person is wise and has no mistaken\njudgments about the good, he has no passions. So if the sage loses any\nnatural advantages in misfortune, he has no emotion about them.\nRather, he views them as \u201cindifferents\u201d\n(adiaphora). One might wonder, then, how the sage can truly\nbe said to be virtuous. For if he views the health and welfare of\nhimself and others as indifferents, why would he act to secure or\nprotect his or others\u2019 welfare, as presumably a virtuous person\nwould? The Stoics reply that natural advantages are still pursued, but\nonly to achieve agreement with nature and to realize fully one\u2019s\nrational powers. They are \u201cpreferred indifferents.\u201d\n\nUnlike Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics did not think virtue was\ndeveloped and sustained by any particular kind of community. Granted,\nsocial relationships and community are among the preferred\nindifferents in that they are to be preferred to the opposite\nconditions of hostility, war, and enmity. But they are not necessary\nfor anyone\u2019s happiness. If we lose them, it is not a loss of a\ngenuine good. So the Stoic Epictetus (c. 55\u2013c.135), a freed slave,\nargued that the death of one\u2019s family members is no real loss\nand is no worse than the breaking of a cup. The community that did\nmatter to the Stoics was cosmic. When persons achieve perfect\nrationality, they accord with the rational order of a universe ruled\nby divine reason. This shows that all of us, virtuous or not, are\nruled by one law and so belong to one universal community. As rational\nbeings, we recognize this for we recognize that we share reason with\nother human beings. The Stoic Marcus Aurelius (121\u2013180), a Roman\nemperor, makes the connections in this way: \u201cIf this be so\n[i.e., that reason is shared], then also the reason which enjoins what\nis to be done or left undone is common. If this be so, law also is\ncommon; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, we are\npartakers in one constitution; if this be so, the Universe is a kind\nof Commonwealth\u201d (Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations,\niv.4). The Stoics concluded that, as rational beings, we have no\nreason not to extend our concern beyond our family, friends, and\nimmediate community to our fellow-citizens of the world community.\n\nThe Stoics came to represent a way of life according to which someone\nmight strive for the well-being of others, whether friend or stranger,\nwithout caring about material rewards or worldly success. Because\ntheir view of virtue was independent of any particular social or\npolitical structure, their message held an appeal for all sorts of\npeople, Greek or non-Greek, slave or free, rich or poor.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Greek views of character, see Dent\n(1975), Irwin (1989, 1996), and Sherman (1989).\n",
