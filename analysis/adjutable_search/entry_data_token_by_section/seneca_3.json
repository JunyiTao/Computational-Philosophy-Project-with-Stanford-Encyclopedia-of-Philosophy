    "main_text": "Philosophical Psychology || The Stoic Account of the Soul\n3.1 The Stoic Account of the Soul\n\nThe two most prominent features of the Stoic account of the soul are\nthese: first, the soul is corporeal; second, the adult human soul is\nrational (in the sense that all its operations involve the\nuse of reason) and one (psychological monism). Although\nSeneca appreciates Platonic imagery that presents the soul as\n\u2018loftier\u2019 than bodily things, he is fully committed to the\nStoic view that the soul is a body. Discussion of this issue is, to\nhis mind, somewhat academic, and thus not as salutary as the elevating\nthemes about virtue that he often prefers. But Letter 106\nexplains why we must think of the soul as a body. Only bodies\nact on anything, cause effects; therefore, the soul must be a\nbody (cf. Letter 117 on the good being a body).\n\nTraditionally, Stoic philosophy is considered to have three phases:\nearly (Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, et al.), middle (Panaetius,\nPosidonius, et al.), and late (Seneca, Epictetus, et al.). This\nperiodization importantly hangs on a possible development in the\nphilosophical psychology of the Stoics\u2014the question of whether\nPanaetius and Posidonius move away from so-called psychological\nmonism. According to psychological monism, there is no non-rational\npart or power of the soul. Rather, the soul is one insofar as its\ncommanding faculty is one, and rational. According to psychological\nmonism, motivational conflict and irrational action do not result from\na \u2018struggle\u2019 between the rational and the non-rational\naspects of the soul; what we call irrational must be understood as\n(bad) states of the rational soul. Psychological monism is thus a\ncounterposition to Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s account of the\nsoul, and has major implications for the theory of action, ethics, and\nthe theory of emotion. It is a difficult question whether middle\nStoicism departs from psychological monism. The view that it did was\nfor a long time widely accepted. However, this traditional picture has\nrecently been contested in influential studies (Cooper 1999; Tieleman\n2003). Perhaps early and middle Stoicism are more in agreement than it\nwas previously thought. Accordingly, some recent studies of Seneca\nproceed on the assumption that we need not attempt to figure out\nwhether Roman Stoicism agrees with monistic early or with pluralistic\nmiddle Stoicism (Inwood 2005).\n\nBut Seneca may agree with psychological monism insofar as he does not\ndistinguish between rational and non-rational powers of the soul (as\nin fact, arguably neither did the middle Stoics) and still modify a\nrelated aspect of the early Stoic account of the soul. Psychological\nmonism implies that there is no distinction between practical and\ntheoretical reason. Knowledge bears directly on action. Indeed, all\nphilosophical knowledge is needed for good decision-making. There is\nthus, according to Stoic \u201corthodoxy,\u201d no real distinction\nbetween theorizing and aiming to lead a good life (I. Hadot 1969,\n101). Seneca brings to bear this aspect of Stoic thought in his own\nway. For him, studying the arguments for a particular claim will not\nbring us peace of mind. At the outset of Letter 85, Seneca\ngoes so far as to swear that he does not take pleasure in producing\nproofs for a piece of doctrine that looms large in his\nLetters: that virtue alone brings happiness (85.1). His\naddressee, Lucilius, is presented as urging him to put forward all\narguments and objections that are relevant to this issue, and in\nresponse, Seneca discusses some of them in Letter 85. But\nultimately\u2014and this is evident throughout his\nwritings\u2014this is not enough. Rather, it is important to think\nthrough the implications of the Stoic thesis in a variety of practical\ncontexts, so as then to be able to live by it, for example, when one\nis or is not elected to office, has more or less money than others,\nand so on (Griffin 2007). One needs to think one\u2019s way through\nthese issues repeatedly\u2014and ultimately, thinking about them in\nthe right way must become a way of life.\n\nBut is not this conception of philosophy as a practice in tension with\nthe Stoic conception of reason? Strictly interpreted, this conception\nmight imply that whatever is once understood has become a piece of\nknowledge, and thus guides our action (see I. Hadot 1969, 106).\nSeneca, however, assumes that it is one thing to know something, and\nanother to \u201cfeel\u201d its truth and relevance to one\u2019s\nown life. Here is one of his examples: he knows that it does not\nmatter whether he travels in a fashionable or in a humble carriage,\nbut he blushes if people see him in a humble one (Letter\n87.4). Why should this be so? Why does Seneca suggest, in Platonic\nfashion, that one\u2019s desires for fame and money are going to\nraise their heads if they are not constantly kept down? Second, why\nshould not the complete system of philosophical knowledge, including\nthe study of rigorous dialectical argument, be relevant to leading\none\u2019s life well? In these respects, Seneca seems to weaken the\nearlier Stoic identification of virtue and knowledge\u2014or perhaps,\ndepending on the view we take, he remedies some of the starkness of\nthis identification (on Seneca\u2019s dismissive attitude toward the\nsyllogisms of \u201cdialecticians,\u201d and on how this differs\nfrom early Stoic thought on the value of knowledge for a good life,\nsee Cooper 2004, 314\u2013320).\n",
