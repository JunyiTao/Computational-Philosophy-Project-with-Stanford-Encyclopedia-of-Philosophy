    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Is This an Empirical Issue?\n1.2 Is This an Empirical Issue?\n\nAt least since\n Hume,\n philosophers have assumed that causal questions are largely\nempirical. We look to science to tell us, for example, the\nmoon\u2019s role in causing the tides, or smoking\u2019s\ncontribution to lung cancer: these are not considered philosophical\nquestions. It might seem equally obvious that the mind\u2019s causal\nrole in producing behavior is also a matter for science to settle. So\nis it in fact the case that working scientists, and in particular,\npsychologists, find it necessary to appeal to distinctively mental\nphenomena to account for behavior? Is there evidence in neuroscience\nthat mental states and processes figure in the production of\nactions?\n\nAlthough most psychologists would without hesitation accept the causal\ninteraction of minds and bodies, a small but growing number of\nempirical researchers have insisted that the evidence supports some\nversion of\n epiphenomenalism,\n the thesis that mental states, while caused by physical happenings,\nexert no efficacy in return. Wegner, a psychologist, contends that\naccumulated empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports\nepiphenomenalism, at least with respect to conscious willing (Wegner\n2002, 2004). He draws on influential work by Libet (1985, 2001, 2004)\nand others to argue that conscious intending is itself a product of\nnonconscious processes that do the real causal work, so that free will\nis \u201can illusion\u201d. If Wegner and his colleagues are right,\nthese results could have ancillary implications for the physical\nefficacy of mental states generally. (Note, that some dualists (e.g.\nLowe 2006; Gibb 2013) have appealed to the same work by Libet to\ndefend their own non-traditional models of psychophysical causation).\n\n\nBecause this research has received extensive treatment in recent work\non free will, we will not consider it further, but instead refer\ninterested readers to the sources cited above and to Mele 2014 for\ncritical discussion and references. Here we simply note that\ntraditional and contemporary attempts to assess the efficacy of mental\nstates have run up against philosophical difficulties as well,\ndifficulties that tend to overshadow the experimental evidence\naccumulated thus far. In this sense, the efficacy of mind is quite\nunlike that of, say, the moon or smoking. This will, we hope, become\nclear in the discussion to follow.\n",
