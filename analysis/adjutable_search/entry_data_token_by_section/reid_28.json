    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion\n8. Philosophy of Religion\n\n\nReid formed his philosophy of religion under the influence of his\ndivinity degree received from Marischal College. Following this he was\nlicensed to preach by the presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil in 1731, and\nbecame an ordained minister to New Machar, Aberdeenshire, in 1737. His\nintellectual influences included Samuel Clark, Joseph Butler, and his\nteachers and colleagues in Aberdeen, including George Turnbull. Reid,\nlike Butler, crafted analogical arguments on behalf of the faith, and\nhe states, without much novelty, a design argument and a cosmological\nargument for God's existence. Reid's arguments for God's existence are\nNewtonian in the sense that limitations of physics and Newtonian\nstrictures about attributions of causes prevent Reid from advocating\narguments for God's existence from physics (Callerg\u00e5rd\n2010). Reid's prescient, long-lasting contribution to the history of\nphilosophy of religion concerns the way he shifts his emphasis as\napologist from proving God's existence onto the task of showing that\nit is rational for one to believe in God's existence. On this point\nReid is an innovator and has many contemporary followers. As a\ntestament to this, leading defenders of Christian belief within the\nAnglo-American philosophical tradition do not merely pay homage to\nReid's trailblazing effort to focus upon and articulate the conditions\nunder which religious belief is made rational. They also make\nextensive use of and further develop a number of his arguments and\nmaneuvers in the epistemology of religious belief.\n\n\nReid's abiding confidence in his religious belief meant that\nhis published work on traditional issues in the philosophy of\nreligion, such as God's nature and arguments for God's\nexistence, is minimal. In his lectures and unpublished work,\nhowever, he vigorously attacks Hume, atheists and their\narguments with surprising vitriol. The fact that Reid does not\nthoroughly address canonical issues in philosophy of religion\nin the context of his published work, despite the personal and\nprofessional importance of his religious commitments, is a\nconundrum. The principal source for Reid's philosophy of\nreligion outside his published works are sets of student\nnotes\u2014now, a total of four transcripts\u2014from Reid's\nlectures on natural theology at Glasgow in the years\n1763\u20131780. One set has been published as Thomas Reid's\n\u2018Lectures on Natural Theology\u2019 (Reid 1981,\nabbreviated 'Natural Theology' below). This is not a\ndefinitive source of Reid's own views, but given pedagogical\nconventions of the time, and cross-references of materials in\nthe Natural Theology with materials elsewhere in\nReid's corpus, we can draw reliable inferences about Reid's\nphilosophy of religion from them. In this subsection we first\ndiscuss the conundrum just mentioned, then treat Reid's novel\nepistemology of religious belief, and then briefly discuss\ntraditional issues in philosophy of religion.\n",
