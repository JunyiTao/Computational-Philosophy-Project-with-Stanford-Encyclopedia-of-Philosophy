    "main_text": "The history of provability logic\n1. The history of provability logic\n\nTwo strands of research have led to the birth of provability logic.\nThe first one stems from a paper by\n K. G\u00f6del\n (1933), where he introduces translations from intuitionistic\npropositional logic into modal logic (more precisely, into the system\nnowadays called S4), and briefly mentions that provability can be\nviewed as a modal operator. Even earlier, C.I. Lewis started the\nmodern study of modal logic by introducing strict implication as a\nkind of deducibility, where he may have meant deducibility in a formal\nsystem like\n Principia Mathematica,\n but this is not clear from his writings.\n\nThe other strand starts from research in meta-mathematics: what can\nmathematical theories say about themselves by encoding interesting\nproperties? In 1952, L. Henkin posed a deceptively simple question\ninspired by\n G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems.\n In order to formulate Henkin\u2019s question, some more background is\nneeded. As a reminder, G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem\nstates that, for a sufficiently strong formal theory like Peano\nArithmetic, any sentence asserting its own unprovability is in fact\nunprovable. On the other hand, from \u201coutside\u201d the formal\ntheory, one can see that such a sentence is true in the standard\nmodel, pointing to an important distinction between truth and\nprovability.\n\nMore formally, let \\(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner\\) denote the G\u00f6del\nnumber of arithmetical formula \\(A\\), which is the result of assigning\na numerical code to \\(A\\). Let \\(\\Prov\\) be the formalized provability\npredicate for Peano Arithmetic, which is of the form \\(\\exists p \\,\n\\Proof(p,x)\\). Here, \\(\\Proof\\) is the formalized proof predicate of\nPeano Arithmetic, and \\(\\Proof(p,x)\\) stands for \u201cG\u00f6del\nnumber \\(p\\) codes a correct proof from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic\nof the formula with G\u00f6del number \\(x\\)\u201d. (For a more\nprecise formulation, see Smory\u0144ski (1985), Davis (1958).) Now,\nsuppose that Peano Arithmetic proves \\(A \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\)\n\\(\\Prov (\\ulcorner A \\urcorner)\\), then by G\u00f6del\u2019s result,\n\\(A\\) is not provable in Peano Arithmetic, and thus it is true, for in\nfact the self-referential sentence \\(A\\) states \u201cI am not\nprovable\u201d.\n\nHenkin on the other hand wanted to know whether anything could be said\nabout sentences asserting their own provability: supposing that Peano\nArithmetic proves \\(B \\leftrightarrow \\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner)\\),\nwhat does this imply about \\(B\\)? Three years later, M. L\u00f6b took\nup the challenge and answered Henkin\u2019s question in a surprising way.\nEven though all sentences provable in Peano Arithmetic are indeed true\nabout the natural numbers, L\u00f6b showed that the formalized version\nof this fact, \\(\\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner) \\rightarrow B\\), can be\nproved in Peano Arithmetic only in the trivial case that Peano\nArithmetic already proves \\(B\\) itself. This result, now called\nL\u00f6b\u2019s theorem, immediately answers Henkin\u2019s question. (For a\nproof of L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem, see\n Section 4.)\n L\u00f6b also showed a formalized version of his theorem, namely that\nPeano Arithmetic proves \n\n\\[\n\\Prov(\\ulcorner \\Prov(\\ulcorner B\\urcorner ) \\rightarrow B\\urcorner ) \n \\rightarrow \\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner ).\n\\]\n\n\nIn the same paper, L\u00f6b formulated three conditions on the\nprovability predicate of Peano Arithmetic, that form a useful\nmodification of the complicated conditions that Hilbert and Bernays\nintroduced in 1939 for their proof of G\u00f6del\u2019s second\nincompleteness theorem. In the following, derivability of \\(A\\) from\nPeano Arithmetic is denoted by \\(\\PA \\vdash A\\):\n\nIf \\(\\PA \\vdash A\\), then \\(\\PA \\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner\n)\\);\n\\(\\PA \\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner A\\rightarrow B\\urcorner) \\rightarrow (\n\\Prov(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner ) \\rightarrow \\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner\n));\\) \n\\(\\PA \\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner ) \\rightarrow\n\\Prov(\\ulcorner \\Prov(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner ) \\urcorner ).\\) \n\n\nThese L\u00f6b conditions, as they are called nowadays, seem to cry\nout for a modal logical investigation, where the modality \\(\\Box\\)\nstands for provability in PA. Ironically, the first time that the\nformalized version of L\u00f6b\u2019s theorem was stated as the modal\nprinciple \n\n\\[\n\\Box(\\Box A \\rightarrow A) \\rightarrow \\Box A\n\\]\n\n\nwas in a paper by Smiley in 1963 about the logical basis of ethics,\nwhich did not consider arithmetic at all. More relevant\ninvestigations, however, seriously started only almost twenty years\nafter publication of L\u00f6b\u2019s paper. The early 1970s saw the rapid\ndevelopment of propositional provability logic, where several\nresearchers in different countries independently proved the most\nimportant results, discussed in Sections\n 2,\n 3, and\n 4.\n Propositional provability logic turned out to capture exactly what\nmany formal theories of arithmetic can say by propositional means\nabout their own provability predicate. More recently, researchers have\ninvestigated the boundaries of this approach and have proposed several\ninteresting more expressive extensions of provability logic (see\n Section 5).\n",
