    "main_text": "Thomas Reid\n6. Thomas Reid\n\nThomas Reid, known for his theory of perception and an epistemic\ntheory he calls \u201ccommon sense\u201d, urges a version of the\ndistinction of qualities in two of his main philosophical works:\nAn Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common\nSense (1764) and Essays on the Intellectual Powers of\nMan (1785). Both use an empirical method to investigate basic\nfaculties of the human mind such as perception, conception, and\njudgment. Qualities of bodies are identified as the objects of\nperception. Among them, Reid finds the foundation of a division\naligned with the standard lists of PQs and SQs presented as a\ndifference in how we know them. Some scholars maintain his doctrine of\nP/SQs is entirely epistemic (Lehrer 1978; McKitrick 2002), but others\ncontend it depends on a metaphysical distinction (Van Cleve 2015:\n110\u201312).\n\nReid is also known for his extended critique and unrelenting\nrepudiation of the way of ideas. He finds it in the whole of\nphilosophy from Democritus to Berkeley and Hume. Characterizing it as\nthe view that there is a single sort of mind-dependent entity that we\nmust immediately apprehend in order to apprehend anything else, he\ncontends it precludes all cognition of things outside the mind (Reid\n1785 [2002: 27\u201332, 199\u2013200]; Nichols 2003; Van Cleve 2015:\n57\u201398). In his view, it is the source of most false and mistaken\nphilosophical accounts of perception (Reid 1785 [2002: 249,\n261\u20135]).\n\nReid\u2019s concept of sensation is a main instrument of his\nopposition to the theory of ideas. He holds sensations to be\nnon-intentional objects of consciousness which have potential to be\nconceived; they are what they are felt to be and felt to be what they\nare (Reid 1785 [2002: 36\u20138, 193\u20134]). Perceptions, by\ncontrast, are cognitive. An episode of perception breaks down to an\nact of conceiving an external object and an act of believing in its\npresent existence. Sensations are, then, wholly extrinsic to\nperceptions. But with one exception, perception of all sorts of\nobjects is attended by a simultaneous sensation which is the effect of\nthe object operating on sensory organs of the perceiver (Reid 1785\n[2002:\n 193\u20134])[5]\n\nTwo terms are used for the mind\u2019s shift from a non-intentional\nsensation to a perception. The sensation is a \u201csign\u201d to\nthe mind of the presence of the quality that causes it, in particular,\na natural sign grounded in the constitution of our nature (Reid 1785\n[2002: 119]). The sensation \u201csuggests\u201d a certain\nconception and firm belief; the one is \u201cnaturally and\nnecessarily annexed\u201d to the others. The transition is\nnon-inferential, not due to habit, experience, or education. It\nfollows, according to Reid, that the conjunction of acts is a\nconsequence of the naturally inexplicable constitution of human nature\n(Reid 1764 [1997: 7\u20138, 40\u201344]; 1785 [2002:\n96\u2013101]).\n\nThat sensations and perceptions of the qualities that cause them are\ndistinct mental acts is, like the theory of ideas, a point on which\nphilosophical theories of perception founder as Reid sees it (e.g.,\nReid 1785 [2002:199\u2013200]). His empirical evidence shows that\nsensations and the corresponding qualities have the same names in\nvirtually all human languages: \u201csmell of a rose\u201d is\nambiguous as between an aromatic feeling and a quality possessed by a\nkind of flower. The quality and the sensation are generally confounded\nby imagination as if they were the same operation (Reid 1764 [1997:\n43]; 1785 [2002: 193\u201399]). This is benign for ordinary purposes,\naccording to Reid, but a thorn in the side of philosophers. It\nobscures a difference among the various qualities perceived by sense\nthat Reid\u2019s decisive division of sensation and perception brings\nto light.\n\nAccording to Reid, when experiencing the smell of a rose, you have a\npleasing sensation and directly perceive the quality of a body that\ncauses it. The sensation is felt; the external cause is conceived and\nfirmly believed to exist. By contrast, an experience of hardness or\nsoftness involves faint and uninteresting sensations that serve just\nas signs to which the mind immediately responds by conceiving and\nbelieving in the bodily qualities they stand for. Pressing a hand on\nthe top of a table, you have a sensation which is typically unnoticed\nand you notice a property of the table, a cohesion of its parts\nsufficiently firm to resist any change of its shape. Tactual\nperception of figure is similar: when you press your hand around the\nsurface of a ball, you feel the figure; although the feeling can be\nnoticed with attention and practice, it is usually disregarded (Reid\n1785 [2002: 193\u20137]; 1764 [1997: 55\u20137]).\n\nThe contrast provides the foundation of Reid\u2019s distinction\nbetween qualities listed as primary and secondary. The senses give us\n\u201ca direct and a distinct\u201d notion of the primary qualities\nand inform us \u201cwhat they are in themselves\u201d, but\n\u201conly a relative and obscure\u201d notion of the SQs, one that\ntells us \u201conly that they \u2026 produce in us a certain\nsensation\u201d and \u201cleave us in the dark\u201d about\n\u201cwhat they are in themselves\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002:\n200\u2013203]; 1764 [1997: 61\u20132]). By a \u201cdistinct\nnotion\u201d, Reid means one that provides clear and distinct\nunderstanding of its object. Our notion of hardness is said to inform\nus perfectly of what that quality is; \u201cit is manifest to\nsense\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002: 203]). By a \u201cdirect\nnotion\u201d, he means one that is not relative. A relative notion of\na thing, \u201cis, strictly speaking, no notion of the thing at all,\nbut only of some relation which it bears to something else\u201d\n(Reid 1785 [2002: 200\u201303]). For instance,\n\n\nThat smell in the rose is an unknown quality \u2026 which is the\ncause \u2026 of a sensation which I know well\u2026The same\nreasoning will apply to every secondary quality. (Reid 1785 [2002:\n202])\n\n\nTwo of Reid\u2019s reflections on this contrast are especially\nimportant. First, there are no disputes about the natures of the\nprimary qualities because the are exhibited to sense. Primary\nqualities are investigated by the a priori methods of the\nmathematical sciences. Reid attributes this to the distinctness of our\nconcepts of them and the knowledge of their natures the concepts\nprovide. They are subjects of conceptual necessary truths. But because\nsecondary qualities are obscure to sense, they are an appropriate\nsubject of the sort of formal inquiry conducted in natural philosophy.\nTheir natures are not known directly by the senses but may be\ndiscovered by observation, reasoning, and deft use of hypotheses;\ne.g., we know vibrations cause sounds and reflected light causes\nsensations of colors (on the proper method of natural philosophical\ninquiry (see Reid 1785 [2002: 267\u201375]).\n\nThe second reflection concerns the \u201ccapitol part\u201d\nsensations bear in the \u201cnotion we form of the [object\nperceived]\u201d (Reid 1785 [2002: 204]). Unlike the easily forgotten\nsensations that accompany perception of PQs, many sensations caused by\nSQs have a salience that makes us attend to them and form concepts of\nthem. They are not just signs of the qualities when we perceive them:\n\u201cthe thought of a secondary quality always carries us back to\nthe sensation it produces\u201d, This is because although each\nperception is conjoined with a sensation proper to it (Reid 1785\n[2002: 199]), relative notions specify every object as an unknown\ncause. We have only their known effects by which to reflect on them\nand mark them as different from each other. This has been called the\n\u201ccapitol part\u201d thesis. In effect, post-perceptual\napprehension of SQs is mediated by conception of the sensation that is\nits sign\u2014apparently, a mediation Reid considers innocuous (see\nReid 1785 [2002: 134]; for different views about what that might be,\nsee Nichols 2007: ch. 10; Copenhaver 2004; Buras 2011; Van Cleve 2015:\n297\u2013300). The implications of this for the meanings of SQ terms\nis disputed by scholars.\n\nTwo main issues are debated in the literature on Reid\u2019s P/SQ\ndistinction:\n\nWhether SQs as known by our senses are dispositions or causal\nbases of them;\nWhether or not the capitol part thesis commits Reid to the view\nthat sensations are semantic constituents of the meanings of SQ terms\n(Lehrer 1989: 27).\n\n",
