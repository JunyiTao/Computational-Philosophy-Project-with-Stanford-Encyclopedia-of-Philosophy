    "main_text": "\n\nOrgan transplantation raises difficult ethical questions about\npeople\u2019s claims to determine what happens to their bodies before\nand after death. What are these claims? What would it be to respect\nthem? How should they fit with the claims of organ donors\u2019\nfamilies or the needs of people whose own organs have failed? And then\nhow should organs be allocated? Who should get priority and why? As\nwith other topics in applied ethics, satisfactory answers require\nknowing the relevant facts, in this case about organ\ntransplantation.\n\nIn summary form, the following empirical claims about organ\ntransplantation are widely accepted:\n\nOrgan transplantation is a successful treatment for organ failure\nin many cases.\nOrgan transplantation is cost-effective compared with other\ntreatments for organ failure (Machnicki et al. 2006; Persad 2018\nclaims that transplantation is not cost-effective compared with\nlife-saving treatments for other conditions besides organ\nfailure).\nMost organ transplantation nowadays is routine, not experimental\n(Tilney 2003; Veatch and Ross 2015). The organs in question are the\nkidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, and intestine. This entry\ndiscusses only the \u201croutine\u201d cases. Experimental ones\nraise additional questions, but these are more properly dealt with as\npart of the entry on\n the ethics of clinical research.\n Present examples of experimental transplantation include faces and\nuteri (Bayefsky & Berman 2016; Freeman and Jaoud\u00e9 2007;\nLotz 2018; O\u2019Donovan, Williams, & S. Wilkinson 2019; Robertson\n2016; Sandman 2018; S. Wilkinson & Williams 2015; Williams\n2016).\nTransplant organs are often scarce. Many people who would benefit\nfrom receiving a transplant do not get one.\n\n\nOrgans are taken from the dead and the living. Each category raises\nseparate problems and we begin with dead organ donors.\n",
