    "main_text": "Motivations || Suspending judgement\n2.4 Suspending judgement\nYou are sometimes in a position where none of your evidence seems\nto speak for or against the truth of some proposition. Arguably, a\nreasonable attitude to take towards such a proposition is suspension\nof judgement.\n\nWhen there is little or no information on which to base our\nconclusions, we cannot expect reasoning (no matter how clever or\nthorough) to reveal a most probable hypothesis or a uniquely\nreasonable course of action. There are limits to the power of\nreason. (Walley 1991: 2)\n\nConsider a coin of unknown bias. The Bayesian agent must have a\nprecise belief about the coin\u2019s landing heads on the next toss. Given\nthe complete lack of information about the coin, it seems like it\nwould be better just to suspend judgement. That is, it would be better\nnot to have any particular precise credence. It would be better to\navoid betting on the coin. But there just isn\u2019t room in the Bayesian\nframework to do this. The probability function must output some\nnumber, and that number will sanction a particular set of bets as\ndesirable.\nConsider \\(\\underline{P}(X)\\) as\nrepresenting the degree to which the evidence\nsupports \\(X\\). Now\nconsider \\(I(X) = 1- (\\underline{P}(X) +\n\\underline{P}(\\neg X))\\). This measures the degree to which the\nevidence is silent\non \\(X\\). Huber\n(2009) points out that precise probabilism can then be\nunderstood as making the claim that no evidence is ever silent on any\nproposition. That is, \\(I(X)=0\\) for\nall \\(X\\). One can never suspend\njudgement. This is a nice way of seeing the strangeness of the precise\nprobabilist\u2019s attitude to evidence. Huber is making this point about\nDempster-Shafer belief functions (see\n historical appendix,\n section 7), but it carries over to IP in general.\nThe committed precise probabilist would respond that\nsetting \\(p(X)=0.5\\) is suspending\njudgement. This is the maximally noncommittal credence in the\ncase of a coin flip. More generally, suspending judgement should be\nunderstood in terms of maximising\nentropy (Jaynes 2003; Williamson 2010:\n49\u201372). The imprecise probabilist could argue that this\nonly seems to be the right way to be noncommittal if you are\nwedded to the precise probabilist representation of belief. That is,\nthe MaxEnt approach makes sense if you are already committed to\nrepresentation of belief by a single precise probability, but loses\nits appeal if credal sets are available. Suspending judgement is\nsomething you do when the evidence doesn\u2019t determine your\ncredence. But for the precise probabilist, there is no way to signal\nthe difference between suspension of judgement and strong evidence of\nprobability half. This is just the weight/balance argument again.\nTo make things more stark, consider the following delightfully odd\nexample from Adam Elga:\n\nA stranger approaches you on the street and starts pulling out\nobjects from a bag. The first three objects he pulls out are a\nregular-sized tube of toothpaste, a live jellyfish, and a travel-sized\ntube of toothpaste. To what degree should you believe that the next\nobject he pulls out will be another tube of\ntoothpaste? (2010: 1)\n\nIn this case, unlike in the coin case, it really isn\u2019t clear what\nintuition says about what would be the \u201ccorrect\u201d precise\nprobabilist suspension of judgement. What Maximum Entropy methods\nrecommend will depend on seemingly arbitrary choices about the formal\nlanguage used to model the situation. Williamson is well aware of this\nlanguage relativity problem. He argues that choice of a language\nencodes some of our evidence.\nAnother response to this argument would be to take William James\u2019\nresponse to W.K. Clifford (Clifford 1901; James\n1897). James argued that as long as your beliefs are consistent\nwith the evidence, then you are free to believe what you like. So\nthere is no need to ever suspend judgement. Thus, the precise\nprobabilist\u2019s inability to do so is no real flaw. This attitude, which\nis sometimes called epistemic voluntarism, is close to the\nsort of subjectivism espoused by Bruno de Finetti, Frank\nRamsey and others.\nThere does seem to be a case for an alternative method of\nsuspending judgement in order to allow you to avoid making any bets\nwhen your evidence is very incomplete, ambiguous or imprecise. If your\ncredences serve as your standard for the acceptability of bets, they\nshould allow for both sides of a bet to fail to be acceptable. A\nprecise probabilist cannot do this since if a bet has (precise)\nexpected value \\(e\\) then taking the other\nside of that bet (being the bookie) has expected\nvalue \\(-e\\). If acceptability is understood\nas nonnegative expectation, then at least one side of any bet is\nacceptable to a precise agent. This seems unsatisfactory. Surely\ngenuine suspension of judgement involves being unwilling to risk money\non the truth of a proposition at any odds.\nInspired by the famous \u201cBertrand\nparadox\u201d, Chandler (2014)\noffers a neat argument that the precise probabilist cannot jointly\nsatisfy two desiderata relating to suspension of judgment about a\nvariable. First desideratum: if you suspend judgement about the value\nof a bounded real variable \\(X\\), then it\nseems that different intervals of possible values\nfor \\(X\\) of the same size should be treated\nthe same by your epistemic state. Second desideratum:\nif \\(Y\\) essentially describes the same\nquantity as \\(X\\), then suspension of\njudgement about \\(X\\) should entail suspension\nof judgement about \\(Y\\). Let\u2019s imagine now\nthat you have precise probabilities and that you suspend judgement\nabout \\(X\\). By the first desideratum, you\nhave a uniform distribution over values\nof \\(X\\). Now consider \\(Y =\n1/X\\). \\(Y\\) essentially describes the\nsame quantity that \\(X\\) did. But a uniform\ndistribution over \\(X\\) entails a non-uniform\ndistribution over \\(Y\\). So you do not suspend\njudgement over \\(Y\\). A real-world case of\nvariables so related is \u201cice residence time in clouds\u201d and\n\u201cice fall rate in clouds\u201d. These are inversely related,\nbut describe essentially the same element of a climate\nsystem (Stainforth et al. 2007:\n2154).\nSo a precise probabilist cannot satisfy these reasonable desiderata\nof suspension of judgement. An imprecise probabilist can: for example,\nthe set of all probability functions\nover \\(X\\) satisfies both desiderata. There\nmay be more informative priors that also represent suspension of\njudgement, but it suffices for now to point out that IP seems better\nable to represent suspension of judgement than precise\nprobabilism. Section 5.5 of Walley\n(1991),\ndiscusses IP\u2019s prospects as a method for\ndealing with suspension of judgement.\n",
