    "main_text": "The divinity of the cosmos\n7. The divinity of the cosmos\n\nOne of the strongest and most commonly raised objections to pantheism\nis that it is simply inappropriate to call the universe\n\u2018God\u2019. Thus Schopenhauer complains that \u201cPantheism\nis only a euphemism for atheism,\u201d for \u201cto call the world\nGod is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a\nsuperfluous synonym for the word world\u201d (Schopenhauer 1851,\nI:114, II:99). It has been described as nothing more than\n\u2018materialism grown sentimental\u2019 (Illingworth 1898, 69),\nwhile more recently Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion\ncomplains that \u201cPantheism is sexed-up Atheism\u201d (Dawkins\n2007, 40). It is clear that the more naturalistically the cosmos is\nconceived the stronger that objection must seem, but to estimate more\ncarefully its validity the following six sections take in turn a\nnumber of characteristics which the cosmos possesses or might possess\nand which could be thought to make it divine. We may proceed from the\nleast to the most contested, noting that not all pantheists will agree\non all marks.\n",
