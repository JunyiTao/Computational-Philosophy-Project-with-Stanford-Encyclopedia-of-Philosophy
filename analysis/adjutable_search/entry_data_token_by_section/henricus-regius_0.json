    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nRegius was born in Utrecht, The Netherlands (the Republic of the Seven\nUnited Netherlands at the time), on 29 July 1598, into a wealthy\nfamily of brewers, and died on 19 February 1679 in the same\ncity. Following initial studies in Arts at the University of Franeker,\nhe studied medicine at Groningen and Leiden, and subsequently at the\nUniversity of Montpellier (France). In 1623 he received his MD from\nthe University of Padua (Italy). Regius was appointed town physician\nin Utrecht on his return there in 1625 and, following a period as\nheadmaster of the Latin School at Naarden (where he was challenged\nabout his religious orthodoxy as a Calvinist), he returned to Utrecht\nin 1634 and was re-appointed town physician in 1637. The Illustrious\nSchool of Utrecht had become a university in 1636 and, two years\nlater, Regius was appointed \u2018extraordinary\u2019 Professor of\nTheoretical Medicine and Botany (equivalent to an associate professor,\nwho was paid a significantly reduced salary). The following year,\n1639, he was promoted to full professor. In 1640 Regius was awarded a\nsalary increase, on the understanding that he would provide extra\nlectures to his students on natural philosophy. Since there were\nalready professors of philosophy, mathematics, and theology in place\nat Utrecht, all of whom were senior to Regius, this extension of his\ncontract included the seeds of subsequent controversies about\nphilosophical and theological theses, and of disputes about\ndisciplinary boundaries at the University.\n\n\nRegius first came to Descartes\u2019 attention through a mutual friend,\nHenricus Reneri (1593\u20131639), and almost immediately (in August\n1638) began a correspondence with Descartes, which continued until\n1645. In keeping with the custom at that time, he also presided as a\nprofessor over disputations at the University (the equivalent of\nresearch seminars, presented by students in the form of a defence of\ntheses that were composed by their supervisor). The texts of\ndisputations were normally printed and distributed in advance\nof their oral presentation, and some rare copies of Regius\u2019\ndisputations survive. These were initially concerned with medical\nmatters, such as a controversial disputation supporting Harvey\u2019s\ntheory of blood circulation (Regius 1640a). During the year 1641,\nRegius considered publishing a book on natural philosophy, and\nconsulted both Descartes and Gisbertus Voetius (1589\u20131676), the\nProfessor of Theology and University Rector, about his plans. While\nDescartes recommended that Regius develop his ideas in the form of\ndisputations, Voetius initially advised publication as a monograph,\npossibly to avoid conflict with faculty members in theology or\nphilosophy. Regius adopted Descartes\u2019 advice and, in April 1641, he\nbegan a series of disputations under the title Physiologia sive\ncognitio sanitatis (Regius 1641a).\n\n\nIn November 1641, however, Regius initiated a new series of\ndisputations, De illustribus aliquot quaestionibus\nphysiologicis (Regius 1641b), in which he challenged Aristotelian\ntheses that were taught by his colleagues in philosophy and theology at\nthe University. This attracted a very negative response from Voetius,\nwho relied on Aristotelian philosophy to articulate his version of\nCalvinist theology. The resulting lengthy controversy, during which\nRegius lost the support of Descartes while simultaneously continuing\nthe conflict with Voetius, is discussed below. He published the first\nedition of his book on natural philosophy under the title\nFundamenta physices (1646); Chapter XII, entitled De\nhomine (Regius 1646, 245\u2013306), provided a synoptic\nexposition of his controversial views about human nature.\n\n\nDespite the bitter and extended controversy in which Regius engaged\nwith Voetius and the university authorities, he was later appointed Rector of\nthe University of Utrecht (a one-year honorary position) in 1649, and\nagain in 1662. He published an amended, enlarged edition of the\nFundamenta physices under the title Philosophia\nnaturalis in 1654, and a third edition in 1661. A French\ntranslation appeared in 1687. He remained in Utrecht, except for a\nbrief period when he was captured as a hostage by the French army in\nlate 1673, and died there in 1679.\n",
