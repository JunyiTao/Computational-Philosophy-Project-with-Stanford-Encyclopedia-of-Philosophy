The Significance of Content Externalism\n\nThe significance of content externalism is potentially far-reaching\nthough often unclear and disputed.\n\nIdealism. Content externalism is sometimes portrayed as a\nthesis whose truth precludes idealism in at least some of its major\nforms (see Rowlands 2003, for example). However, it is not clear that\nthis is really the case. For example, even a Berkeleian idealist could\naccept Putnam\u2019s twin earth arguments if thus inclined. All that\nis required for Putnam\u2019s argument to work is a distinction\nbetween the way water and twater appear and their underlying\nstructures. This is something the Berkeleian idealist can, it seems,\naccommodate. For example, the Berkeleian idealist can explain the\ndifferences in underlying structure between water and twater in terms\nof the difference in the ideas that God would flash into your mind and\nthat of your twin post 1750, when you both get down to the business of\ninvestigating (what you think of as) the underlying structure of the\nsubstance in your oceans and rivers. Content externalism requires a\nreality that exists independently of the thinking subject or subjects\nthat feature in the thought experiment. But it does not appear to\nrequire that this reality be non-mental. Some forms of content\nexternalism require this, supposition for example Sartre (1943\n[1957]). But not all forms appear to do so. The relation between\ncontent externalism and idealism, in its various forms, is, therefore,\nnot a straightforward one.\n\nContent Externalism and Self-Knowledge. Externalism is\nimportantly connected with issues surrounding our introspective\nknowledge of our own mental states. Such knowledge appears to be a\npriori, or at least privileged, in that it is acquired without\nrelying on empirical evidence or observations. On the face of it,\nexternalism threatens the existence of such privileged knowledge. If\nthe contents of our thoughts are determined in part by our relations\nto the environment, then one might think that external observations\nare needed in order to know what we think. But self-knowledge does not\ncome about through empirical investigations. So either, contrary to\nappearance, we do not really know the contents of our own thoughts or,\nif we do, externalism is false. (See the entry on\n externalism and self-knowledge\n for further discussion).\n\nExternalism and Mind-Body Theories. Externalism has important\nconsequences for a number of different mind-body theories. Burge\n(1979) believes that externalism refutes individualistic theories of\nintentional mental states. These are theories that define or explain\nwhat it is for a person to have an intentional mental state purely in\nterms of intrinsic facts about that person without reference to the\nenvironment. Examples of such theories include the identity theory,\nand\n functionalism (see entry)\n in its traditional guise. McGinn (1989) and Burge (1986, 1993) both\nargue that externalism refutes the token-identity theory (and hence\nthe type-identity theory as well). This is contested by Davidson\n(1987), Macdonald (1990) Gibbons (1993), and Frances (2007). With\nregard to functionalism, one way to deal with externalism is to adopt\na divide-and-conquer strategy. One might restrict functionalism to\nproviding an account of what it is to be a particular kind of mental\nstate (e.g., a belief) individualistically, while adopting an\nexternalist theory of content (Fodor 1987). Alternatively, one might\nadopt a \u201clong arm\u201d functionalism that specifies functional\nroles in such a way that they incorporate worldly items and properties\n(Block 1990). On such a view, the functional role of your belief that\nwater is wet would be different from the functional role of your\ntwin\u2019s belief that twater is wet, on the grounds that the\nfunctional role of your belief involves you perceiving and doing\nthings with water whereas that of your twin involves her perceiving\nand doing things with twater.\n\nThough externalism may (or may not) be incompatible with these\ninternalist forms of physicalism, this should not be taken to imply\nthat externalism is itself an antiphysicalist doctrine, for one might\nhold that although mental contents do not supervene on narrow physical\nproperties, they do supervene on wide physical properties. There is no\nobvious reason for physicalism about the mind to require a\ncreature\u2019s mental properties to supervene on its narrow physical\nproperties. (For discussion of the requirements on physicalism, see\nthe entry on\n physicalism.)\n\nMental Causation. Another debate that arises out of\nexternalism concerns the legitimacy of wide contents in causal\nexplanations. Most philosophers agree with Davidson (1980) that\nbeliefs and desires play an important role in the causal explanation\nof actions. However, it is not clear how this can be reconciled with\nexternalism. The problem comes up because it has been suggested that\ncausal explanations of behavior should appeal only to the intrinsic\nproperties of our bodies, properties that describe what is happening\nhere and now within us (Stich 1983). But externalism says that mental\ncontents are determined by causal, social or historical factors,\nfactors which extend spatially and temporally beyond the body. This\nseems to imply that wide mental contents cannot be causally relevant\nbecause of their relational nature.\n\nThere are two main strategies to show that wide mental contents can\nlegitimately enter into causal explanations. The first strategy is to\nargue that the causal efficacy of a mental state with wide content\nderives from the causal efficacy of a corresponding internal state. To\nuse a non-mental example, we often say that a mosquito bite causes\nswelling, even though being a mosquito bite is a relational property.\nHowever, one worry with this approach is why it doesn\u2019t show\nthat wide contents are not causally relevant after all, because it is\nthe internal component (the skin itching, swollen skin disturbance)\nthat is doing all the causal work. A different way to defend the\nexplanatory relevance of wide content is to identify its distinctive\nexplanatory role without them being parasitic upon the causal efficacy\nof intrinsic properties. For example, according to Dretske (1988),\nwhen my intention to drink water causes me to raise my glass, the\nbehavior that is the object of the causal explanation is not a single\nevent, but a complex process where an internal state causes some\nbodily movement. Dretske argues that the wide content of my intention\nplays a causal role because it provides a structural explanation of\nhow the internal brain state comes to be recruited to cause the bodily\nmovement. Williamson (2000) offers a different account of the\nexplanatory role of wide contents. He thinks they provide us with a\nbetter understanding of the connection between the mental states of an\nagent and his actions in the non-immediate future, because our actions\ntypically involve complex interactions with the environment.
