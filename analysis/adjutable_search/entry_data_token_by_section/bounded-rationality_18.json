Better with Bounds\n\nOur discussion of improper linear models\n (section 2.3)\n mentioned a model that often comes surprisingly close to\napproximating a proper linear model, and our discussion of the\nbias-variance decomposition\n (section 4.2)\n referred to conjectures about how cognitive systems might manage to\nmake accurate predictions with very little data . In this section we\nreview examples of models which deviate from the normative standards\nof global rationality yet yield markedly improved\noutcomes\u2014sometimes even yielding results which are impossible\nunder the conditions of global rationality. Thus, in this section we\nwill survey examples from the statistics of small samples and\ngame theory which point to demonstrable advantages to\ndeviating from global rationality.\n",
