    "main_text": "History of sortal from 1690\u20131959 || Strawson on sortals\n3.1 Strawson on sortals\n\nThe expression \u201csortal\u201d reappeared on the philosophical\nstage in the 1950s and 1960s in lectures and in the written work of\nStrawson (1959), Quine (1960), Geach (1962), and Wiggins (1967) and\nvariations on the concept entered the mainstream philosophical\nvocabulary. Because philosophers lecture and circulate manuscripts\nwith their ideas for years\u2014sometimes decades\u2014before\npublication, the dates of the main publications of the protagonists\nconcerning sortals do not necessarily reflect the historical\npriorities and influences. The most accurate simple summary is that\nthe ideas of Geach, Strawson and Quine co-evolved and that\nWiggins\u2019 writings built on a foundation laid by those\npredecessors.\n\nThe widespread use of the term \u201csortal\u201d definitely derives\nfrom Strawson, but readers should note that there are important\ndifferences among these authors. For a start, Strawson applies\n\u201csortal\u201d to universals, Quine to predicates, and Wiggins to\nconcepts. Thus, these authors illustrate the realist, nominalist, and conceptualist interpretations of sortals\u2019 nature. Geach did not use the word \u201csortal\u201d but most commentators identify his notion of a \u201csubstantival\nexpression\u201d with \u201csortal\u201d in the other writers. Although Geach seems closest to Quine, since \u201cexpression\u201d\nseems to be a linguistic notion, Geach generalizes his results across\nlanguages in ways that Quine would not find agreeable. These\ndifferences in usage among the four authors would not be important, if\nthere were simple direct agreed upon relations among concepts,\nuniversals, and expressions. But there aren\u2019t.\n\nStrawson made no mention of Locke, Aristotle, Spinoza or Frege in the\ncontext of introducing the expression \u201csortal universal\u201d\nin Individuals in 1959.\n\n\nA sortal universal supplies a principle for distinguishing and\ncounting individual particulars which it collects. (1959: 168) \n\n\nStrawson had two main projects in Individuals. The first was\nto show that material bodies and persons occupy a central position\namong particulars and that items in these two categories are basic to\nour conceptual scheme. The second was to\n\n\nestablish and explain the connexion between the idea of a particular\nin general and that of an object of reference or logical subject.\n(1959: 11\u201312)\n\n\nSortal universals are central to this second task because, according\nto Strawson, reference to particulars occurs by using expressions that\nare associated with sortal universals.\n\nStrawson thus emphasizes two characteristics. Sortals\n\n(1)\n give a criterion for counting the items of that kind\n(2)\n give a criterion of identity and non-identity among items of that kind\n\n\nIt is not difficult to see why someone would identify these\nrequirements. In order to know that there are exactly two Gs in\na region S, it is necessary and sufficient to know that\n\nThere is an x which is in S and has G, a y\nwhich is in S and has G and is not identical to\nx, and for any z, if z is a G which is in\nS then z is identical with either x or\ny.\n\nThe phrase \u201ccriterion of identity\u201d seems to mean a\ncriterion which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for\nidentity. In many cases, however, a weaker condition suffices for\ncounting. To conclude that there are exactly two Gs in region\nS, all that is required is a sufficient condition for x\nand y to be distinct, and a sufficient condition for z\nto be identical with x or y. In the case of physical\nobjects, it may be that being at the same location at the same time is\nsufficient for identity, and being in entirely separate locations at\nthe same time is sufficient for distinctness. In most circumstances,\nthese will suffice to count Gs, but it is far short of\nproviding answers about partially overlapping Gs, and provides\nno guidance about identity across time. So often we may be able to\ncount Gs without having a criterion of identity in the strong\nsense.\n\nOne of the unclarities of the phrase \u201ccriterion of\nidentity\u201d is that it is never spelled out what the criterion is\nto be applied to. For example, is it a criterion to be applied to\nnames of objects or to perceptual representations of objects or to the\nobjects themselves? It is also unclear how strictly we are to\nunderstand \u201ccriterion\u201d. In \u201cEntity and\nidentity\u201d (published in 1976 and reprinted in Strawson 1997b)\nStrawson proposed being quite strict, limiting the phrase\n\u201ccriterion of identity\u201d to cases where there either is an\nexplicitly statable necessary and sufficient condition that does not\nuse the identity relation, or one where the identity relation is only\napplied to constituent parts of the objects. This can be done for\nnumbers and sets, but probably not for any kind of concrete objects.\nIn 1997, he retracted that proposal in favor of the looser (and still\nundefined) general philosophical use of the term (1997a: 2\u20133).\nIn contrast, Wiggins understands the counting criterion very strictly\nso one instance where there is not a determinate answer to a question\nleads him to reject the counting criterion (2001: 75).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Griffin (1997) only requires\nthat\n\n\nA term \u201cA\u201d is a sortal iff there can be cases in\nwhich \u201cA\u201d provides, without further conceptual\ndecision, and without borrowing other principles of individuation,\nprinciples adequate for counting As. (1997: 43)\n\n\nSince most philosophers who invoke the distinction want to reject\n\u201cthing\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d and \u201centity\u201d as\nnon-sortals, Griffin\u2019s suggestion is inadequate, or at least is\na shift to a different concept with the same label. The question\n\u201cHow many things/objects/entity are in the space\nS?\u201d, where S is an empty space has the determinate\nanswer \u201czero\u201d, so all of these terms pass the Griffin\nstandard. One could attempt to amend the criterion by requiring that\nthere can be cases which satisfy the above criteria and where there is\nat least one A. However, this fails to delineate the right cases,\nbecause there are sortals such as \u201cunicorn\u201d and\n\u201csquare circle\u201d which have no instances. These points, and\nthe observation that some of the various notions of sortal diverge,\nwere first made in Feldman 1973 but have not been widely noted\n(see the entry on relative identity). We will revisit some of these issues in\n Section 7.1\n on sortals and infant cognition.\n",
