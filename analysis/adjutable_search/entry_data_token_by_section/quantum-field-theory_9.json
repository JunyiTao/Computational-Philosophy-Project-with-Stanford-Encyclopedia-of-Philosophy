    "main_text": "Axiomatic Reformulations of QFT and their Interpretive Significance || Motive One: Operationalism\n4.1 Motive One: Operationalism\n\nThe first motive\u2013operationalism\u2013is not so higly valued any\nmore today, and for good reasons (see entry on Operationalism).\nNevertheless, it was, not only in physics, very strong in and around\nthe 1950s, when axiomatic reformulations of QFT entered the scene.\nAccordingly, the impact of operationalism must not by overlooked.\nAlready in the 1930s the problem of perturbative infinities (see\nSupplement \u201cThe History of QFT\u201d) as well as the\npotentially heuristic status of the Lagrangian formulation of QFT\nstimulated the search for concise and ideally axiomatic\nreformulations. About a dacade later it became clear that\noperationalism and mathematical rigour may go hand in hand, because\nthe setting of conventional QFT\u2014where quantum fields are basic,\nwith field values being assigned to points in spacetime\u2014is both\nmathematically ill-defined and in conflict with the\n\u201coperational\u201d idea that the core elements of an empirical\ntheory should be observable quantities, which can be measured by means\nof certain physical operations.\n\nThe mathematical aspect of the problem is that a field at a point,\n\\(\\phi (x)\\), is not an operator on a Hilbert space. The physical\ncounterpart of the problem is that it would require an infinite amount\nof energy to measure a field at a point of space-time. One way to\nhandle this situation\u2014and one of the starting points for\naxiomatic reformulations of QFT\u2014is not to consider fields at a\npoint but instead fields which are smeared out in the vicinity of that\npoint using certain functions, so-called test functions. The result is\na smeared field \\(\\phi (f) = \\int \\phi (x) f(x) dx\\) with\nsupp\\((f)\\subset \\mathcal{O}\\), where supp(\\(f\\)) is the support of\nthe test function \\(f\\) and \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is a bounded open region\nin Minkowski space-time. In Wightman\u2019s field axiomatics from the\nearly 1950s, the basic entities are then polynomial algebras\n\\(P(\\mathcal{O})\\) of smeared fields, i.e., sums of products of\nsmeared fields in finite space-time regions \\(\\mathcal{O}\\).  Thus it\nreplaces the mapping \\(x \\rightarrow \\phi (x)\\) in the conventional\nformulation of QFT by \\(\\mathcal{O} \\rightarrow P(\\mathcal{O})\\).\n\nFrom an operationalist perspective equally troublesome as point-like\nquantities are global quantities, like total charge, total energy or\ntotal momentum of a field. They are unobservable since their\nmeasurement would have to take place in the whole universe.\nAccordingly, quantities which refer to infinitely extended regions of\nspace-time should not appear among the observables of the theory, as\nthey do in the standard formulation of QFT. In the discussion of such\n\u201cparochial observables\u201d below we will see that it is not\nso clear in the end whether this is really a good argument (see\nRuetsche 2011 and Feintzeig 2018). In any case, however, it has been\nimportant in the formation of axiomatic reformulations of QFT.\n\nAnother operationalist reason for favouring algebraic formulations\nderives from the fact that two quantum fields are physically\nequivalent when they generate the same algebras of local observables.\nSuch equivalent quantum field theories belong to the same so-called\nBorchers class which entails that they lead to the same \\(S\\)-matrix.\nAs Haag (1996) stresses,\nfields are only an instrument in order to \u201ccoordinatize\u201d\nobservables, more precisely: sets of observables, with respect to\ndifferent finite space-time regions. The choice of a particular field\nsystem is to a certain degree conventional, namely as long as it\nbelongs to the same Borchers class. Thus it is more appropriate to\nconsider these algebras, rather than quantum fields, as the\nfundamental entities in QFT. The resulting operationalistic view of\nQFT is that it is a statistical theory about\nlocal measurement outcomes, expressed in terms\nof local algebras of observables. Thus, it is no surprise\nthat Haag\u2019s (1996) famous textbook on \u201cAlgebraic\nQFT\u201d, the most successful axiomatic reformulation, bears the\ntitle \u201cLocal Quantum Physics.\u201d\n",
