    "main_text": "Ethics and Ethical Theory || Non-Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n3.4 Non-Consequentialist Elements and Interpretations\n\nWhile recognizing that \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views have many\nelements in common with consequentialism, and indeed, leaving open the\npossibility that the consequentialist interpretation may be correct,\nGordon Davis has pointed out some potential worries for this form of\ninterpretation, as well as elements of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nthought that might be understood as more similar to a Kantian view\n(Davis 2013). In particular, Davis points out that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s aspiration is to help all sentient beings\nattain Buddhahood, at which time they would all have attained a kind\nof equality. If \u015a\u0101ntideva assigns intrinsic value to\nequality, then he must not be a utilitarian, although he might still\nbe some kind of consequentialist. Indeed, as Davis suggests, the idea\nof a world in which everyone has abandoned wrongdoing and its\npsychological causes in favor of the nonviolent community of equals\ncould be compared to Kant\u2019s Kingdom of Ends. \n\nDamien Keown\u2019s highly influential and important book The\nNature of Buddhist Ethics (2001) advanced an interpretation of\nearly Buddhism and of the Therav\u0101da tradition based on a\ncomparison with Aristotelian virtue ethics. Though \u015a\u0101ntideva\ndiffers dramatically from Aristotle in many ways, there can be no\ndoubt that he is deeply concerned with the cultivation of character,\nand that he is much more interested than at least some Western\nutilitarians have been in the question of how we can become better\npeople. Thus, the possibility of important similarities between\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s thought and theories within the domain of\nvirtue ethics should not be disregarded.\n\nThe most sophisticated critique of the consequentialist interpretation\nof \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s ethics has been put forward by Stephen\nHarris (in his 2015). Harris accepts that \u015a\u0101ntideva puts\nimpartial benevolence near the center of his normative perspective,\nand that the primacy of this motivation constitutes a resemblance with\nWestern consequentialist views. He also agrees that\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views allow consequences to have some role\nin providing reasons for action. But this second similarity is quite\nweak, as most plausible ethical theories do regard consequences as\nhaving some practical significance. Aside from these claims, Harris\nquestions whether we are in a position to ascribe any particular ethical\ntheory, either consequentialist or otherwise, to \u015a\u0101ntideva.\nAnd he offers several reasons in support of his critique.\n\nFirst, \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s book is not just a work of\nphilosophy; as all interpreters accept, it is also a meditation\nmanual. This means that \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s verses, even when\nthey appear to be providing reasons for accepting a certain claim, can\noften be interpreted instead as providing us with instructions for a\nparticular meditative practice that is intended to bring about an\nemotional shift in our consciousness. The statements that we entertain\nas part of such a practice do not need to be asserted as true, as part\nof a sober statement of philosophical tenets. We can wish for\nimpossible things to happen during the cultivation of altruism (as in\nmuch of BCA X); and we can tell ourselves things that are\nfalse, suspending disbelief during a meditation session, in order to\ndevelop certain virtues. Since this is the case, we must be cautious\nabout holding that \u015a\u0101ntideva is actually making assertions\nin any particular passage; instead, we should keep in mind that he may\nonly be giving meditation instructions. Of course, as Harris points\nout, he might be doing both of these things at once; and if we can\nshow that this is what he is doing, the passages would be just as good\nevidence for his ethical theory as they would be if they were not also\nmeditation instructions. \n\nA second reason Harris provides for doubting that we can know what\nkind of ethical theory to attribute to \u015a\u0101ntideva rests on\nthe central role of the concept of up\u0101ya in\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in general, and in\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s writings in particular (see Harris 2015:\n253). Up\u0101ya, a Sanskrit word often translated as\n\u201cskillful means\u201d or \u201cexpedient means\u201d, refers\nto an approach to teaching allegedly adopted by Buddhas and other\nhighly advanced spiritual teachers towards those who have not yet\nreached the highest stages of their own spiritual paths. The idea is\nthat the Buddhas don\u2019t always tell such people the final truth;\ninstead, they tell them whatever they need to hear at the time,\nincluding even falsehoods, if doing so will be the most effective way\nto support their progress towards spiritual maturity. But since this\nis the case, it may be difficult to know whether, in any given\npassage, \u015a\u0101ntideva is expressing what he takes to be the\nright view, or whether he is offering falsehoods that may nevertheless\nbe helpful to some readers, depending on their own level of meditative\npractice and philosophical training. (For more on up\u0101ya,\nsee, e.g., Pye 1978 [2003], cited by Harris 2015, and Goodman 2011.)\n\nYet another reason for concern about whether we can know the\nunderlying theoretical structure of \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s\nethical thought results from what we could call (though Harris does\nnot) the Fortunate Coincidence Thesis. By this phrase, I mean the view\nthat our moral obligations and our prudential incentives always or\nalmost always coincide if rightly understood. A particularly clear and\nstriking form of the Fortunate Coincidence Thesis is expressed at\nBCA VIII.129:\n\n\nAll those who suffer in the world do so because of their desire for\ntheir own happiness. All those happy in the world are so because of\ntheir desire for the happiness of others. (C&S: 99; and see\nVII.42, and so on)\n\n\nIf this is true, it is wonderful news for those of us who want to be\nhappy; but it may be a bit inconvenient for those of us who want to\nclassify Buddhist ethical views. This is because the Fortunate\nCoincidence Thesis makes it difficult or impossible to pull apart the\njustificatory role of self-interest from that of what we owe to\nothers. If these two perspectives give us the same answers across a\nwide range of cases, how can we tell which of them would take primacy,\nif they were to conflict? So as Harris points out, even what seem to\nus to be very demanding and lofty exhortations in Buddhist texts to\npractice extreme altruism might, in light of the Fortunate Coincidence\nThesis, be justified at the foundational level by a eudaimonistic\nvirtue ethics, or even by a form of rational egoism.\n\nObviously, a theory that is egoist at its foundations is in severe\ntension with the Ownerless Suffering Argument; and though it may be\nless obvious, there is an equally strong tension between that argument\nand a view that tells me to prioritize my own virtue over the\ncultivation of virtue in others. Harris does not think that this\nconsideration is decisive, however, since he regards the Ownerless\nSuffering Argument as itself a mere up\u0101ya. It must be an\nup\u0101ya, Harris says, since it relies on the Abhidharma\nunderstanding of the doctrine of no self, whereas\n\u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s actual view belongs to a very different\nform of Buddhist philosophy, the Madhyamaka. It would follow that we\ncannot use the Ownerless Suffering Argument to ascertain what kind of\nethical theory, if any, \u015a\u0101ntideva would actually be prepared\nto defend as a final account of what reasons we have. \n\nIn summary, though all participants in the discussion now seem to\nacknowledge that there are at least some important similarities\nbetween \u015a\u0101ntideva\u2019s views and the theories of Western\nconsequentialist ethicists, scholarly controversy continues about\nexactly how close these similarities are, and about how far the\navailable textual evidence legitimately allows us to go in attributing\nto \u015a\u0101ntideva any particular views about the foundations of\nethics.\n",
