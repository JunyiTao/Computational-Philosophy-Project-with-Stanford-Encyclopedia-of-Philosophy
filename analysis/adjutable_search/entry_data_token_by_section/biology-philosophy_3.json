Philosophy of Systematic Biology\n\nPhilosophical discussion of systematics was a response to a\n\u201cscientific revolution\u201d in that discipline in the 1960s\nand 1970s. This revolution saw the discipline transformed from\nphenetics and evolutionary taxonomy alongside the application of\nquantitative methods. The successor was the \u201ccladistic\u201d\napproach due to Willi Hennig (1966), which argues that the sole aim of\nsystematics should be to represent \u201cnatural\u201d groups of\norganisms. Cladists took natural groups to be monophyletic groups\n(where a monophyletic group includes an ancestor species and all of\nits descendant species). Thus, a cladistic approach only represents\nphylogeny, which is the pattern of common descent. Philosopher David L.\nHull was an active participant in scientific debates throughout these\ntwo revolutions; in fact, he was president of the Society of\nSystematic Zoology in 1984\u20131985 and of the Philosophy of Science\nAssociation in 1985\u20131986 (Hull 1965; Hull 1970; Hull 1988; Sober\n1988). Additionally, a great deal of conceptual work appeared on the\nnature of phylogenetic inference. Phylogenies are commonly represented\nwith phylogenetic trees. Discovering phylogenies presents the familiar\nproblem of underdetermination of theory by evidence. For example, if\nwe have four taxa, there are fifteen possible rooted trees. However,\nonly one of those trees corresponds to the actual historical lineage.\nAdditionally, the phylogeny of given taxa cannot be directly observed,\nand so must be inferred. Thus, the problem of phylogenetic inference\nis how to justify such historical hypotheses. The original\nphylogenetic method of choice was parsimony, which says to choose the\ntree which proposes the fewest evolutionary events. Some phylogenetic\nsystematists argued for this approach using Sir Karl Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism (Wiley 1975, Farris 1983). In the 1970\u2019s,\nJoseph Felsenstein demonstrated that lineages with a certain topology\nwere subject to a systematic error in parsimony analysis (Felsenstein\n1978, 2004). This is the problem of \u201clong-branch\nattraction\u201d in which taxa at the end of long branches are\nmistakenly grouped together by parsimony analysis, instead of with\ntaxa with which they share a more recent common ancestor (Haber 2008).\nFelsenstein proposed using statistical techniques (in particular\nmaximum likelihood methods) to avoid this problem. Debates between the\ncamps continue (Sober 2004). \n\nThe biologist Michael Ghiselin piqued the interest of philosophers\nwhen he suggested that systematics was fundamentally mistaken about\nthe ontological status of biological species (Ghiselin 1974). Species\nwere not natural kinds in the way that chemical elements are. Instead,\nthey are historical particulars like nations or galaxies. They have a\nbeginning through speciation, they have parts that are integrated over\ntime by biological relations, and they cease to exist by going extinct\n(Mishler & Brandon 1987). Additionally, individual organisms are\nnot instances of species, as a wedding ring is an instance of gold.\nInstead, they are parts of species, as one is a part of a family. As\nSmart had earlier noticed, this has the implication that there can be\nno \u201claws of nature\u201d about biological species per se, at\nleast in the traditional sense of \u2018laws of nature\u2019 (Smart\n1959). David Hull further developed and argued for the \u201cspecies\nas individuals\u201d thesis. He explored its implications for a\nvariety of topics including species names, laws of nature, and human\nnature (Hull 1976, 1978, 1986). \n\nHowever, the view that species are individuals leaves other important\nquestions about species unsolved and raises new problems of its own\n(Kitcher 1984, 1989). For example, suppose you are a population\nbiologist and you need to census the individuals in a population of\nspecies. How do you decide what entities to count? Philosophers and\nbiologists have provided a variety of criteria for answering questions\nlike this including reproduction, life-cycles, genetics, sex,\ndevelopmental bottlenecks, germ-soma separation, policing mechanisms,\nspatial boundaries or contiguity, immune response, fitness\nmaximization, cooperation and/or conflict, codispersal, adaptations,\nmetabolic autonomy, and functional integration (Clarke 2013). So, the\nquestion of what a biological individual is indeed a pressing one\n(Wilson 2005; Okasha 2006; Clarke 2011; Pradeu 2012; Bouchard and\nHuneman 2013; Clarke 2013; Godfrey-Smith 2013; Wilson and Barker\n2013).\n\nBiologists have been, and are still, deeply divided over the species\ncategory (Ereshefsky 1992b; Wheeler and Meier 2000; Coyne and Orr\n2004; Wilkins 2009). Consider Ernst Mayr\u2019s famous biological\nspecies concept (BSC). He writes, \u201cSpecies are groups of\ninterbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated\nfrom other such groups\u201d (Mayr 1963, 89). There are lots of\nconcerns regarding the BSC (Ehrlich and Raven 1969; Sokal and Crovello\n1970; Van Valen 1976; Wiley 1978). Asexual organisms do not\ninterbreed. Thus, on the BSC, there are no species of asexual\norganisms. Many species exhibit some introgression, and thus cannot be\ndistinct species. Last, the BSC is extremely difficult to apply to\nspecies in the fossil record since sex organs do not normally\nfossilize, and reproductive behavior is difficult to corroborate. In\nlight of the problems with the BSC (and for other reasons), biologists\nhave put forward other species concepts. Species pluralism is the\nclaim that there is no single correct species concept that classifies\norganisms exactly the same (Ereshefsky 1992a); rather, there are\nseveral correct species concepts. That is, for some organisms,\ndifferent species concepts will correctly place them in distinct\nspecies. Species monism is the claim that there is a single correct\nspecies concept. Some allege species pluralism is temporary because we\nwill eventually find the single best concept (Hull 1999). The debate\nbetween pluralists and monists rages on (Wilson 1999). \n\nBiological species are often given as one of the classic examples of a\n\u201cnatural kind\u201d. The philosophy of systematics has had a\nmajor influence on recent work on classification and natural kinds\n(Dupr\u00e9 1993, 2002; Wilson et. al. 1997; Boyd 1999; Griffiths\n1999; Wilson 1999; Okasha 2001; Walsh 2006). For example, can there be\na notion of natural kind or essentialism consistent with the\n\u201cpopulation thinking\u201d found in biology (Mayr 1975, Sober\n1980; Ariew 2008)? \n",
