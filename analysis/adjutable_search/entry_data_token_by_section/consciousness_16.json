    "main_text": "The explanatory question: How can consciousness exist? || Diversity of explanatory projects\n5.1 Diversity of explanatory projects\n\n\nThe How question is not a single question, but rather a general\nfamily of more specific questions (Van Gulick 1995). They all concern\nthe possibility of explaining some sort or aspect of consciousness, but\nthey vary in their particular explananda, the restrictions on their\nexplanans, and their criteria for successful explanation. For example,\none might ask whether we can explain access consciousness\ncomputationally by mimicking the requisite access relations in a\ncomputational model. Or one might be concerned instead with whether the\nphenomenal and qualitative properties of a conscious creature's mind\ncan be a priori deduced from a description of the neural\nproperties of its brain processes. Both are versions of the How\nquestion, but they ask about the prospects of very different\nexplanatory projects, and thus may differ in their answers (Lycan\n1996). It would be impractical, if not impossible, to catalog all the\npossible versions of the How question, but some of the main options can be\nlisted.\n\nExplananda. Possible explananda would include the various\nsorts of state and creature consciousness distinguished above, as well\nas the seven features of consciousness listed in response to the What\nquestion. Those two types of explananda overlap and intersect. We might\nfor example aim to explain the dynamic aspect either of phenomenal or\nof access consciousness. Or we could try to explain the subjectivity of\neither qualitative or meta-mental consciousness. Not every feature\napplies to every sort of consciousness, but all apply to several. How\none explains a given feature in relation to one sort of consciousness\nmay not correspond with what is needed to explain it relative to\nanother.\n\nExplanans. The range of possible explanans is also diverse.\nIn perhaps its broadest form, the How question asks how consciousness\nof the relevant sort could be caused or realized by nonconscious items,\nbut we can generate a wealth of more specific questions by further\nrestricting the range of the relevant explanans. One might seek to\nexplain how a given feature of consciousness is caused or realized by\nunderlying neural processes, biological structures,\nphysical mechanisms, functional or\nteleofunctional relations, computational\norganization, or even by nonconscious mental states. The\nprospects for explanatory success will vary accordingly. In general the\nmore limited and elementary the range of the explanans, the more\ndifficult the problem of explaining how could it suffice to produce\nconsciousness (Van Gulick 1995).\n\nCriteria of explanation. The third key parameter is how one\ndefines the criterion for a successful explanation. One might require\nthat the explanandum be a priori deducible from the explanans,\nalthough it is controversial whether this is either a necessary or a\nsufficient criterion for explaining consciousness (Jackson 1993). Its\nsufficiency will depend in part on the nature of the premises from\nwhich the deduction proceeds. As a matter of logic, one will need some\nbridge principles to connect propositions or sentences about\nconsciousness with those that do not mention it. If one's premises\nconcern physical or neural facts, then one will need some bridge\nprinciples or links that connect such facts with facts about\nconsciousness (Kim 1998). Brute links, whether nomic or merely well\nconfirmed correlations, could provide a logically sufficient bridge to\ninfer conclusions about consciousness. But they would probably not\nallow us to see how or why those connections hold, and thus they would\nfall short of fully explaining how consciousness exists (Levine 1983,\n1993, McGinn 1991).\n\n\nOne could legitimately ask for more, in particular for some account\nthat made intelligible why those links hold and perhaps why they could\nnot fail to do so. A familiar two-stage model for explaining\nmacro-properties in terms of micro-substrates is often invoked. In the\nfirst step, one analyzes the macro-property in terms of functional\nconditions, and then in the second stage one shows that the\nmicro-structures obeying the laws of their own level nomically suffice\nto guarantee the satisfaction of the relevant functional conditions\n(Armstrong 1968, Lewis 1972).\n\n\nThe micro-properties of collections of H2O molecules at 20\u00b0C\nsuffice to satisfy the conditions for the liquidity of the water they\ncompose. Moreover, the model makes intelligible how the liquidity is\nproduced by the micro-properties. A satisfactory explanation of how\nconsciousness is produced might seem to require a similar two stage\nstory. Without it, even a priori deducibility might seem\nexplanatorily less than sufficient, though the need for such a story\nremains a matter of controversy (Block and Stalnaker 1999, Chalmers\nand Jackson 2001).\n",
