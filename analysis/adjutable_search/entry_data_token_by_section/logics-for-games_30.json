    "main_text": "Analyzing Play || Conclusion: Theory of Play\n4.3 Conclusion: Theory of Play\n\nTopics discussed in this section are less standard in the literature\nthan those of the sections before. In an orthodox reading, various of\nthe aspects addressed would not be considered part of game theory\nproper. The extended agenda followed here has been embraced by van\nBenthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011) as a\nlarger program for logic, going under the heading \u2018Theory of\nPlay\u2019. The underlying line of reasoning is that games do not\nfully determine their outcomes, as they allow for various styles of\nplay. Hence, it might be the process of play itself, including\nplayers\u2019 types and how they change over time, that might the\nbest focus for understanding interaction, rather than mere games or\ngame forms alone. Similar lines of argument can be found in the\nfoundations of computation where it has been proposed that the\nessential topic of study should be behavior (Abramsky\n2008).\n\n",
