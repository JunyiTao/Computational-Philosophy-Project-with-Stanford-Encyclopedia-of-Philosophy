    "main_text": "Back to Literary Discourse\n15. Back to Literary Discourse\n\nSo much for non-literary discourse. The second question is: Does what\nholds for non-literary discourse also hold for literary discourse?\nBeardsley\u2019s convinced that it does. He sees no fundamental\ndifference between the two. There\u2019s a lot to be said for that\nview. It largely jibes with our interpretive experience and recognizes\nthe continuity of all forms of discourse. It also doesn\u2019t\nrequire us to read by a new set of rules when we put down The\nRacing Forum and pick up Ruskin, which is certainly appealing.\nThose are impressive reasons in its favor, and strongly recommend it\nfor adoption.\n\nBut the key word here is \u201cadoption\u201d. The view is a\nproposal for how to conceptualize literature (and in the long run art\nin general); it isn\u2019t dictated by the facts of the case or by\nthe very concept of literature. An alternative proposal, and a popular\none in many circles, is to conceptualize literature as much more\nclosely tied to the life of the author, and to attach greater\ninterpretive weight to his intentions than with non-literary\ndiscourse. This proposal does bifurcate discourse, but, advocates\nwould claim, there are cultural and aesthetic advantages to doing so.\nThree of them are that (1) literature is thereby tied much more\nclosely to biography, history, and culture in general, (2) the realm\nof the aesthetic is not as segregated from, but is much more\nintegrated into, other valuational realms than it would otherwise be,\nand (3) natural, even irrepressible, urges to look beyond art to the\nartist aren\u2019t automatically frustrated or denigrated, as far as\ncriticism is concerned. The systematic virtues and vices of both this\nposition and Beardsley\u2019s can\u2019t be pursued here, but it is\nimportant to note that the issue is a large and overarching one\nconcerning how best to conceptualize art and its place in human\nlife.\n",
