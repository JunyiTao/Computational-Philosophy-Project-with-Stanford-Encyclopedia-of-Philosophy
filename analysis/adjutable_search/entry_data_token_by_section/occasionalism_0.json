    "main_text": "The History of Occasionalism || Islamic Occasionalism\n1.1 Islamic Occasionalism\n\nThough the term \u201coccasional cause\u201d has been suggested as\noriginating with the French philosopher Louis de la Forge (Carraud\n2002, 347), the first philosophers to explicitly expound the position\nwere the Islamic occasionalists. Our brief discussion here will not be\nable to do justice to its complex and rich development, but Islamic\noccasionalism seems to have emerged when the theologians of the\nAsh\u2018arite school of kal\u0101m (Islamic doctrinal\ntheology) began to consider the implications of the systematic\nreinterpretation, development, and integration of Aristotelianism and\nNeo-Platonism that occurred within the Islamic intellectual world in\nthe tenth and eleventh centuries (cf. Adamson, P. & Taylor, R.C.\n2005, 4\u20136). Among these Islamic occasionalists, al-Ash\u2018ari\n(873\u2013935), the founder of Ash\u2018arite school, appears to\nhave been particularly influential (Griffel 2007).\n\nIf al-Ash\u2018ari was the first of the Islamic occasionalists, it\nwas al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (c.1055\u20131111), the great philosopher and\ntheologian of the Ash\u2018arite school, who presented some of the\nmost significant and influential arguments for occasionalism in his\ninfluential work, The Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Tah\u00e2fut al-fal\u00e2sifa). This work has long been\nthe source of the interpretation that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b himself was\na committed global occasionalist, but recent interpretations have\nchallenged this view, arguing that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s goal\nsimply is to defend the possibility of miracles against the claims of\nthe fal\u00e2sifa, and that he leaves open the possibility\nof some kind of genuine causality in creatures (Griffel 2007).\nNotwithstanding this issue of whether al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b was an\noccasionalist or not, no one doubts that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b found\nsome key views of the fal\u00e2sifa Avicenna (Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, 980\u20131037) problematic and worthy of criticism.\nIn particular, it seems to have been Avicenna\u2019s\n\u201cAristotelian\u201d approach to creaturely natures and powers\nthat was most problematic for al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b in rendering\nconsistent with Ash\u2018arite\n kal\u0101m.[1]\n The main point of tension seems to stem from the Avicennan view that,\ngiven the natures or essences of creatures, there are causally\nnecessitating relations between creaturely causes and their effects\nsuch that the creaturely cause necessarily brings about the effect.\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b took this view to be in tension with the\ndoctrinal claim that theological orthodoxy requires the possibility of\nmiracles, which consist in the divine interruption of the ordinary\ncourse of events in nature. Thus, what worried al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nmost is the idea that if creatures genuinely necessitate their\neffects, this would seem to imply that even in the face of divine\nmiraculous intervention, the natural effects would have to follow from\nthe cause. But such an implication was unacceptable for those holding\nthe standard understanding of divine omnipotence, which\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b and other philosophers of the Ash\u2018arite\ntheological tradition thought to be essential to kal\u0101m.\nAny natural necessitating relation resistant to the exercise of divine\ncausal power was thought to be inappropriate, and thus causally\nnecessitating relations, properly understood (that is, in ways\nconsistent with divine omnipotence), are only instantiated in cases of\ndivine causation. In addition to this theologically motivated\nargument, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s criticism of causally\nnecessitating relations between creaturely causes and effects also\nincorporates his distinctive views on the modal relations between\ndistinct entities or facts, according to which \u201cthe connection\nbetween what is habitually believed to be a cause and what is\nhabitually believed to be an effect is not necessary\u201d\n(TF 170) Al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s central claim, as we\nwill examine in more detail later, was that \u201ceach of the two\nthings has its own individuality and is not the other, and neither the\naffirmation nor the negation, neither the existence nor the\nnon-existence of the one is implied in the affirmation, negation,\nexistence, and non-existence of the other\u201d (Weinberg 1964,\n 123).[2]\n\nWe end this section with the observation that the main disagreement\nbetween those who regard al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b as an occasionalist and\nthose who do not seems to rest on whether they take\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b to have accepted the principle that a genuine\ncause must causally necessitate its effect. Those who argue for the\noccasionalist reading of al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b appear to regard him as\ncommitted to this principle, while their opponents (such as Griffel)\nargue that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b is not fully committed to this\nprinciple. If al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b is indeed committed to this\nprinciple, then given that al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b only grants such\ncausally necessitating powers to God, he would be committed to denying\nany causal powers in creature. In contrast, if al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\ndoes not think that genuine causality implies that the cause causally\nnecessitates the effect, then he would in effect be making room for a\ndifferent conception of causation, one that is distinct from divine\ncausality, the unique causally necessitating power. This different\nconception of cause would allow for genuine secondary causality in\nthat creaturely causes would be real causes on this alternative\nconception, despite the fact that they do not causally necessitate\ntheir effects. Implicit in this disagreement over how to read\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b are key questions that naturally arise in\ndisputes over the nature of causation: can something be a cause even\nif it does not necessitate its effect? Are not such antecedents at\nmost mere occasional causes? Moreover, what is the nature of the\nnecessitation involved? We will pursue these questions in the\nfollowing sections.\n",
