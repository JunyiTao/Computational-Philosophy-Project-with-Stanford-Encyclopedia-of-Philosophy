At the general level of an overall definition, the most one\ngets are the bromides: that a proximate cause cannot be\nremote from its putative effect; it must be a direct\ncause of the effect; it must not involve such\nabnormality of causal route that is freakish; it\ncannot be of harms that were unforeseeable to the actor; its\nconnection to the harm cannot be coincidental; it must make\nthe harm more probable; etc. These bromides are often uttered\nas if they were synonyms, which in truth the decided cases reveal that\nthey are not.\n",
