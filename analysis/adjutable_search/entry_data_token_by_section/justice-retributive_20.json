    "main_text": "The Question of Justification || Conformity with our considered judgments\n5.1 Conformity with our considered judgments\n\nThe argument here has two prongs. First, most people intuitively think\nthat it is important to punish wrongdoers with proportional hard\ntreatment, even if no other good would thereby be brought about.\nSecond, there is no reason to doubt that these intuitions are\nreliable.\n\nIt seems clear that the vast majority of people share the retributive\nintuition that makes up the first prong (Moore 1997: 101). Consider\nagain the example of the incapacitated rapist mentioned in\n section 1.\n The intuition is widely shared that he should be punished even if\ndoing so is expected to produce no consequentialist good distinct from\nhim getting the punishment he deserves.\n\nThe weakness of this strategy is in prong two. One might suspect that\nretributive intuitions are merely the reflection of emotions, such as\na thirst for vengeance, that are morally dubious. They may be deeply\ngrounded in our species as part of our evolutionary history, but that\nfact by itself is insufficient to consider them morally\nreliable\u2014compare other deeply engrained emotional impulses, such\nas tribalism, that are clearly morally problematic (Bloom 2013).\nMoreover, the label \u201cvengeance\u201d is not merely used as a\npejorative; a retributive or vengeful response to wrongdoing has to\nconfront moral arguments that it is a misplaced reaction. Foremost\namong these is the argument that we do not really have free\nwill\u2014see\n section 4.1.3.\n Respect for the dignity of wrongdoers as agents may call for\ncensuring them when they do wrong, and with requiring them to make\nreparations when those can be made. It is unclear, however, why it\ncalls, in addition, for hard treatment. Rather, sympathy for\nwrongdoers as products of their biology and environment seems to call\nfor mercy and forgiveness (for a contrary view, see Levy 2014).\n\nMoore (1997: 145) has an interesting response to this sort of\ncriticism. He turns to the first-person point of view. He imagines\nthat he has committed some horrible violent crime, and then says that\nhe hopes his response \u201cwould be that I would feel guilty unto\ndeath\u201d. As a result, he hopes that he would welcome\npunishment for having committed such a crime. Moore then turns the\ntable and says that one should resist the \u201celitist and\ncondescending\u201d temptation to withhold that judgment from others\n(1997: 148).\n\nThis is a rhetorically powerful move, but it is nonetheless open to\nfour objections. First, it presupposes that one can infer the\npropriety of the third-person reaction of blame and punishment from\nthe first-person reaction of guilt and self-punishment. But\nthere are things a person should do to herself that others should not\nfeel equally free to do to her (Duff 2007: 383; Zaibert 2018:\n94\u201395). Second, it may reflect only the imagination of a person\nwho has committed no such serious crimes, rather than the insight of a\nperson who knows what it is like to have committed a serious crime and then\ntried to come to terms with himself. Third, it equates the propriety\nof feeling or inflicting guilt with the propriety of adding punishment\nto guilt. But why is guilt itself not enough (see Husak 2016:\n59\u201360)? Fourth, one can question whether even the reaction of\nguilt is a morally sound one. Might it not be a sort of sickness, as\nNietzsche (1887 [2006: 60]) put it, \u201cbad conscience, \u2026\nthe will to self-violation\u201d.\n\nConsider what Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 18) said, as a mature philosopher,\nlooking back on his own efforts to justify retributivism:\n\n\n[M]y enthusiasm for settling scores and restoring balance through\nretributive justice may in part have been extensions of what Nietzsche\ncalled \u201ca soul that squints\u201d\u2014the soul of a\nshopkeeper or an accountant. If I had been a kinder person, a less\nangry person, a person of more generous spirit and greatness of soul,\nwould robust retributivism have charmed me to the degree that it at\none time did? I suspect not.\n\n\nThe point is not to say that this first justificatory strategy fails.\nIt is to say that it does not obviously succeed. The notion of\nretributive justice would be on sounder footing if this justification\nwere supplemented by a theoretical justification for punitive hard\ntreatment that ties it to a more general set of principles of justice.\nDoing so would help dispel doubts that retributive intuitions are the\ncrabbed judgments of a squinty, vengeful, or cruel soul.\n",
