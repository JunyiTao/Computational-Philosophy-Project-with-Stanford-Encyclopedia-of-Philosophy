    "main_text": "Chemistry\n6. Chemistry\n\nKant draws a distinction between \u2018proper\u2019 and\n\u2018rational\u2019 science. The former denotes any discipline that\nis strongly mathematized and relies on \u2018apodictic\u2019 laws,\nsupported by conclusive evidence; Newton\u2019s gravitation theory is\nthe epitome of that. The latter indicates a body of propositions that\nis systematic, viz. explanatorily integrated, and includes laws. Kant\ncounted chemistry as a poster child for it. He lived through a\nwatershed change in that discipline\u2014from Georg Stahl\u2019s\nphlogiston theory to Lavoisier\u2019s renovation of chemistry, its\ncore processes, and taxonomy of stuffs.\n\nIn Metaphysical Foundations, Kant argued that, in a\n\u2018proper\u2019 science, its basic concepts correlate with\nmathematical notions, and the warrant for that correlation comes from\nmetaphysics, e.g. via a picture of the essence of matter. Thereby,\nmetaphysics supplies principles for the construction\u2019 of the\ndomain-specific concepts of that science. But, he continued, no such\nmetaphysical warrant is available for correlating basic\nchemical concepts with mathematics; when such correlations\noccur, they are known a posteriori. (He was aware, of course, that\nchemical practice in his time had discovered quantitative facts, e.g.\nabout the ratios of reagents in a specific reaction.) Thus, he\nconcluded, not only is chemistry not a proper science, but it is not\nlikely to become one ever (4:471).\n\nStill, he counted it as a \u2018rational\u2019 science: he thought\nchemistry owes its systematic order to ideas of reason. Specifically,\nto certain domain-specific artificial concepts introduced for the sake\nof descriptive and explanatory unification of many local regularities\nestablished empirically. For instance, that all solid metals then\nknown \u2018calcinate,\u2019 i.e. form heavier compounds when heated\nin air; and can be obtained from these compounds, under the right\nlaboratory conditions.\n\nAfter 1790, Kant apparently moved to endorse Lavoisier\u2019s new\ntaxonomy of chemical substances, and also his picture of the\n\u2018caloric,\u2019 or \u2018ether\u2019\u2014a species of\n\u2018imponderable fluid\u2019 endowed with causal properties\nrelevant to, among others, heat exchanges, \u2018combustion\u2019\n(oxidoreduction) and phase transitions. And yet, as recent research\nhas established, even in the post-Critical years Kant held fast to his\nabove requirements for a science to count as proper. In light of that,\nlate-Enlightenment chemistry\u2014Lavoisier\u2019s great\ntransformation and Kant\u2019s \u2018ether deduction\u2019\nnotwithstanding\u2014still counted for him as a rational, but\nimproper, science.\n\nInterest in Kant\u2019s philosophy of chemistry has surged in the\nlast decade. McNulty (2014, 2015, 2016) is an especially helpful and\nclear series of studies of Kant\u2019s engagement with that\nrapidly-changing science. Blomme (2023) contributes to the question of\nwhat chemistry was, for Kant. Older discussions of his views on the\ntopic are Carrier (1990, 2001) and Friedman (1992).\n",
