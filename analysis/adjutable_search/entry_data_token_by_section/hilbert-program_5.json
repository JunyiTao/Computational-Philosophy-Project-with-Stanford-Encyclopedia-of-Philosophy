    "main_text": "The Finitary Point of View || Finitary objects and finitist epistemology\n2.1 Finitary objects and finitist epistemology\n\nHilbert characterized the domain of finitary reasoning in a well-known\nparagraph which appears in roughly the same formulation in all of\nHilbert\u2019s more philosophical papers from the 1920s\n (1931b;\n 1922b;\n 1928;\n 1926):\n\n[A]s a condition for the use of logical inferences and the performance\nof logical operations, something must already be given to our faculty\nof representation, certain extralogical concrete objects that are\nintuitively present as immediate experience prior to all thought. If\nlogical inference is to be reliable, it must be possible to survey\nthese objects completely in all their parts, and the fact that they\noccur, that they differ from one another, and that they follow each\nother, or are concatenated, is immediately given intuitively, together\nwith the objects, as something that can neither be reduced to anything\nelse nor requires reduction. This is the basic philosophical position\nthat I consider requisite for mathematics and, in general, for all\nscientific thinking, understanding, and communication.\n (Hilbert, 1926,\n 376)\n\n\nThese objects are, for Hilbert, the signs. For the domain of\ncontentual number theory, the signs in question are numerals such\nas\n\n1, 11, 111, 11111\n\n\nThe question of how exactly Hilbert understood the numerals is\ndifficult to answer. They are not physical objects (actual strokes on\npaper, for instance), since it must always be possible to extend a\nnumeral by adding another stroke (and, as Hilbert also argues in\n\u201cOn the infinite\u201d\n (1926),\n it is doubtful that the physical universe is infinite). According to\n Hilbert (1922b, 202),\n their \u201cshape can be generally and certainly recognized by\nus\u2014independently of space and time, of the special conditions of\nthe production of the sign, and of the insignificant differences in\nthe finished product.\u201d They are not mental constructions, since\ntheir properties are objective, yet their existence is dependent on\ntheir intuitive construction (see\n Bernays 1923,\n 226). What is clear in any case is that they are logically primitive,\ni.e., they are neither concepts (as Frege\u2019s numbers are) nor\nsets. What is important here is not primarily their metaphysical\nstatus (abstract versus concrete in the current sense of these terms),\nbut that they do not enter into logical relations, e.g., they cannot\nbe predicated of anything. In Bernays\u2019s most mature\npresentations of finitism\n (Hilbert and Bernays, 1939;\n Bernays, 1930), \nthe objects of finitism are characterized as formal\nobjects which are recursively generated by a process of\nrepetition; the stroke symbols are then concrete representations of\nthese formal objects.\n\nThe question of what Hilbert thought the epistemological status of the\nobjects of finitism was is equally difficult. In order to carry out\nthe task of providing a secure foundation for infinitistic\nmathematics, access to finitary objects must be immediate and certain.\nHilbert\u2019s philosophical background was broadly Kantian, as was\nBernays\u2019s, who was closely affiliated with the neo-Kantian\nschool of philosophy around Leonard Nelson in G\u00f6ttingen.\nHilbert\u2019s characterization of finitism often refers to Kantian\nintuition, and the objects of finitism as objects given intuitively.\nIndeed, in Kant\u2019s epistemology, immediacy is a defining\ncharacteristic of intuitive knowledge. The question is, what kind of\nintuition is at play?\n Mancosu (1998b)\n identifies a shift in this regard. He argues that whereas the\nintuition involved in Hilbert\u2019s early papers was a kind of\nperceptual intuition, in later writings (e.g.,\n Bernays 1928a)\n it is identified as a form of pure intuition in the Kantian sense.\nHowever, at roughly the same time\n Hilbert (1928, 469)\n still identifies the kind of intuition at play as perceptual. In\n (1931b,\n 266\u2013267), Hilbert sees the finite mode of thought as a separate\nsource of a priori knowledge in addition to pure intuition\n(e.g., of space) and reason, claiming that he has \u201crecognized\nand characterized the third source of knowledge that accompanies\nexperience and logic.\u201d Both Bernays and Hilbert justify finitary\nknowledge in broadly Kantian terms (without however going so far as to\nprovide a transcendental deduction), characterizing finitary reasoning\nas the kind of reasoning that underlies all mathematical, and indeed,\nscientific, thinking, and without which such thought would be\nimpossible. (See\n Kitcher 1976\n and\n Parsons 1998\n on the epistemology of finitism,\n Patton 2014\n for historical and philosophical context of Hilbert\u2019s theory of\nsigns, and\n Eder (forthcoming)\n specifically on the ensuing debate with the German philosopher Aloys\nM\u00fcller.)\n",
