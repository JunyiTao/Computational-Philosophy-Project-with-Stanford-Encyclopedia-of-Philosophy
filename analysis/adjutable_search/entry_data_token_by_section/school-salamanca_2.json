    "main_text": "The Role of the Jesuits\n3. The Role of the Jesuits\n\nAfter the deaths of Domingo de Soto and Melchor Cano, the reputation\nof Salamanca\u2019s Dominicans declined. Domingo Ba\u00f1ez\n(1528\u20131604), a pupil of Cano, is the best known of their\nsuccessors. When his commentary on Thomas\u2019s Summa\nappeared (1584), admitting of no dissent from its doctrines, it\nprovoked a controversy over the theology of grace and free will.\nBa\u00f1ez\u2014also the confessor of St. Theresa of\nAvila\u2014was opposed by the Jesuit Luis de Molina, who accused him\nof being overly deterministic.\n\nMolina was born in Cuenca (Spain) in 1535, entered the Jesuit order at\nthe age of 18, studied in Salamanca and Coimbra, taught theology in\n\u00c9vora (Portugal) from 1568 to 1583 and later in Lisbon. In 1591\nhe was sent to the Jesuit college of his home town of Cuenca and was\nelected in 1600 to the chair of moral theology at the Jesuit College\nin Madrid, where he died in the same year. In 1588 Molina published a\nvolume entitled Liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina\npraescientia, providentia, praedestinatione et reprobatione\nconcordia, usually abbreviated as Concordia, in which he\ntried to reconcile free will with grace, God\u2019s pre-knowledge,\nprovidence, etc. It produced a devastating effect (see below and\nMacGregor 2015), a passionate debate between Dominicans and Jesuits,\nraising accusations of both Pelagian and Calvinist heresy, both of\nwhich were extremely dangerous for Catholic theologians. This\ncontroversy continued until a congregation De auxiliis\nmeeting in Rome under Paul V decreed (1607) that Dominicans and\nJesuits could hold their own opinions on efficacious grace. The\nconflict did not end, however, and in 1611 the Roman Inquisition\nforbade the publication of any further books on the topic\u2014the\nmost drastic case of ecclesiastical censorship of theologians in the\nseventeenth century (Knebel 2000: 170).\n\nIn general, the Jesuits felt less bound than Dominicans to the\nopinions of Thomas Aquinas, which meant that Molina and Su\u00e1rez\nwere allowed a greater degree of originality in their teachings. For\nthis reason, some modern scholars emphasize the differences between\nthe Dominican School of Salamanca and the Jesuit School of Coimbra,\nwhich came after it, though both belong to the broad tradition of\nSpanish Scholasticism.\n\nSu\u00e1rez was a student at Salamanca in 1561, when he joined the\nSociety of Jesus. He was an educator, settling eventually in Coimbra,\nwhere he produced a tract De legibus ac Deo legislatore\n(1612). As a polemicist, he intervened in the quarrel over the oath of\nallegiance imposed by James I on English Catholics after the Gunpowder\nPlot (1605). Su\u00e1rez and his Jesuit contemporary Robert\nBellarmine were the most important Catholic writers on political and\necclesiological issues following the Council of Trent.\n\nWith the death of Su\u00e1rez, the School of Salamanca and its\noffshoots lost their creative edge. Instead, there was an urge to\nrecapitulation. The Discalced Carmelites produced an enormous\ncompilation of past thought, the Cursus Theologiae Moralis;\nand the publication of its third volume in 1670 is often treated as\nmarking the end of the School of Salamanca.\n",
