    "main_text": "Deformed Desires\n2. Deformed Desires\n\nOne kind of motivation that has received and continues to receive a\nfair bit of attention from feminists is what they call \u201cdeformed\ndesires,\u201d \u201cadaptive preferences,\u201d or\n\u201crepressive satisfactions.\u201d Deformed desires are\nsignificant for issues such as autonomy, agency, and responsibility\n(see Section 3).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was perhaps the first philosopher to acknowledge the\nconcept of desires deformed by patriarchy, but Sandra Bartky was one\nof the first philosophers to name them (Mill 1861; Bartky 1990a).\nBartky describes repressive satisfactions as those that \u201cfasten\nus to the established order of domination, for the same system which\nproduces false needs also controls the conditions under which such\nneeds can be satisfied\u201d (Bartky 1990a, 42). Mill, Bartky, and\nMartha Nussbaum attribute the cause of such \u201cfalse needs\u201d\nto various factors, including unequal education, indoctrination to\nbelieve that women are fit mainly for domesticity and other\nnonintellectual pursuits, psychological manipulation, women\u2019s\nfear of moving into new positions that remain unequal and unprotected,\ndenial of autonomy, lack of information or false information about\nfact, lack of reflection or deliberation about norms, and lack of\noptions (Bartky 1990a, 42; Nussbaum 1999a, 149). Jon Elster describes\nhow a person acquires deformed desires, which is that she adapts her\npreferences according to her opportunities and without her control or\nawareness. Elster dubs this kind of adaptation the \u201csour\ngrapes\u201d phenomenon, according to which the fox\u2019s\nconviction that he is prevented from eating grapes that are out of his\nreach causes him to believe that grapes are sour and so to prefer not\nto eat them. Let\u2019s apply this phenomenon to the case of women\nunder patriarchy. The Deferential Wife (described in Section 1) who\nlives in a world in which women are routinely denied educational\nopportunities and access to the best jobs, and so become economically\ndependent on men, is more likely to desire to be servile to her\nhusband and children. A female student who lives in a patriarchal\nculture that teaches women to look to men for protection, security,\nand strength rather than to cultivate these traits in themselves, is\nmore likely to want to date males in power, such as her professor,\nbecause she sees them as exhibiting these traits. One of\nBartky\u2019s examples is that of female narcissism, or an\ninfatuation with the female body, which occurs when women seem\nenthusiastically to embrace unachievable, alienating, sexist standards\nof femininity that are informed by what Bartky calls \u201cthe\nfashion-beauty complex.\u201d Women living in a patriarchal culture\nin which they are judged and objectified according to these standards\nare likely to adopt the standards and prefer to fulfill them.\n\nSeveral features distinguish deformed desires from nondeformed\ndesires. One is that even though most if not all of our desires are\nformed in a social context, deformed desires are formed in response to\nunjust social conditions such as those found in a patriarchal\nsociety in which men are deemed superior to women. A second feature is\nthat satisfaction of deformed desires benefits not the subject who has\nthem as in the typical case of desire-satisfaction, but, according to\nBartky, a social order whose interest lies in domination. For example,\na woman\u2019s desire to conform to the \u201cfashion-beauty\ncomplex,\u201d when satisfied, leaves her with an inferior body\nimage, and demands her time and money which in turn stands in the way\nof her pursuit of her career goals, while men gain economically. A\nfemale student\u2019s desire to date her professor, when satisfied in\nthe typical case, reinforces the stereotypes that women need to be\nwith a (powerful) man for self-validation and that they are not\nintellectual. Men benefit when they, but not women, are taken\nseriously in the pursuit of their careers. One question feminists such\nas Bartky have raised is whether women actually do benefit from\nsatisfying their deformed desires (Bartky 1982; 1990a, 36). While it\nis not implausible to think that women do achieve some benefits (e.g.,\nnarcissistic pleasures from conformity to the fashion-beauty complex,\ngetting dates with men), feminists typically acknowledge that these\nbenefits are often merely short-run: conformists to beauty standards\nrisk self-hatred when they inevitably fall short, and conformists to\ndating standards requiring female passivity and submission often end\nup in autonomy-denying relationships with men. Some feminists argue\nthat conformity to patriarchal standards perpetuates women\u2019s\noppression by perpetuating stereotypes about them, which harms, rather\nthan benefits, all women (e.g., Cudd 1988). Thus feminists admit that\nwhile women in some ways benefit from deformed-desire satisfaction,\nthey are wrong about the harms involved and the \u201creal\u201d\nbenefits of conformity, which are enjoyed by men. In fact, Bartky\nsuggests that it is not merely error that is involved, but deception,\nsince \u201cfalse needs\u201d or deformed desires are\n\u201cproduced through indoctrination, psychological manipulation,\nand the denial of autonomy\u201d (Bartky 1990a, 42). A third feature\nof deformed desires, then, is that typically they involve deception\nabout what their bearer truly wants, or even what is truly in the\nbearer\u2019s own interest or will promote her welfare.\n\nOne significant issue relating to deformed desires is autonomy, which\nis commonly defined as self-determination or self-direction. On the\nface of it, an agent\u2019s satisfying her deformed desires seems to\nstand in the way of promoting her autonomy, for if the satisfaction of\ndeformed desires in reality benefits the system of domination and the\nprivileged persons in it, then satisfying deformed desires does not\nseem to be an indication of the agent\u2019s\nself-determination, but rather the agent\u2019s\nsubordination to the system and its ends. Another way that deformed\ndesires are suspect for reasons relating to autonomy is that they are\nunchosen, the result of adaptation to one\u2019s opportunities and\nwithout one\u2019s awareness or control, as Elster\u2019s\n\u201csour grapes\u201d phenomenon describes. Moreover, the more\ndeformed desires an agent has in her total desire set, the greater the\nlikelihood that she will be under their sway, since they will not be\ncounteracted by nondeformed desires. And the more likely the agent is\nunder the sway of her deformed desires, the less likely she will be\nself-determining. The issue bears on women\u2019s oppression because\nif the agent acts mostly from her deformed desires, she is likely to\ncontribute to her own oppression.\n\nThere are differing views on whether women have deformed desires, to\nwhat extent they do, and what their effect is on the agent\u2019s\nautonomy. On the one extreme, some philosophers deny that women even\nhave deformed desires, so obviously such desires can have no hold on\nwomen or interfere with their autonomy. Christina Hoff Sommers\nbelieves that since women\u2019s preferences are no longer the\nproduct of undemocratic indoctrination and are now taken into account\nby women\u2019s having the right to vote, they are therefore\nauthentic and it would be patronizing and illiberal to criticize\nwomen\u2019s preferences (1994, 259\u2013260). Many evolutionary\npsychologists agree with Sommers that women\u2019s preferences are\nauthentic rather than adaptive ones formed in response to limited\noptions. According to Catherine Wilson, these evolutionary\npsychologists believe further that we live in a just world where\nwomen\u2019s preferences match what they receive and that the\ndistribution of the components of well-being is also just\u2014women\nget what they really want (2004, 101\u2013102). So what explains why\nwomen tend not to prefer new experiences, competition, accumulation,\nand social rewards to the same extent as men? According to Wilson,\nmany evolutionary psychologists attribute women\u2019s and\nmen\u2019s different traits, values, preferences, and interests not\nto discrimination against women, but to differential parental\ninvestment (105). What this means, for these evolutionary\npsychologists, is that females invest more than males in nurturing\ntheir offspring since it is more costly for a female than a male to\nreplace a child. This phenomenon goes hand-in-hand with a greater\ncompetition among males over mating opportunities, since mating with\nmany partners increases the likelihood of having more offspring.\nWilson attributes these ideas to the evolutionary\npsychologists\u2019s belief that we are all playing a game that is\nwon by an individual\u2019s having more viable offspring than others\nof her or his sex (105). This sets up a \u201cwinning human female\nstrategy,\u201d evidenced by thousands of years of evolution, that\nconsists of the following norms: finding the fittest male to be\none\u2019s mate, withholding sex to get commitment, and exchanging\nfidelity and domestic service for lifelong sustenance (106). These\nfemale norms, in turn, according to the evolutionary psychologists at\nissue, reflect female preferences. Women\u2019s lower status is\nexplained, then, not by discrimination, but by their authentic\npreferences. Since women prefer to nurture children, be faithful to\ntheir mate, and avoid making their mate jealous, they do not adopt\nmale norms and preferences associated with success in the world.\n\nMany feminists reject the notion that women have no deformed desires\nbut have only authentic preferences. Martha Nussbaum responds to\nSommers by citing plenty of examples of deformed desires in women, and\nnotes that even conservative economists like Gary Becker, as well as\nphilosophers from Plato to Aquinas to Kant, acknowledge their\nexistence (1999a, 152). Catherine Wilson directly takes on the\nevolutionary psychologists she discusses who reject the notion of\nwomen\u2019s having adaptive preferences. In order to evaluate the\nclaims made by evolutionary psychologists about women\u2019s\npreferences, Wilson believes that we can rely on sources such as our\ndirect personal and social experiences, mediated social experiences\nsuch as impressions from novels, films, and the media, and various\npsychological and sociological data. She chooses to rely on novels,\nwhich, she admits, are somewhat unreliable but nevertheless reflect\nboth the stories of \u201ceverywoman\u201d and certain features of\nthe social world, since they are constrained by plausibility\nconsiderations (110). The novels describe women who initially follow\nthe standard theory of evolutionary psychology to find a wealthy mate\nwhen they are young and have the greatest bargaining power, but\nthrough their characters suggest that what women really want in a mate\nis \u201cyouth, good looks, manners, intelligence, a gentle demeanor,\nand attentiveness\u201d (110). The novels suggest that those whose\nopportunities to achieve wealth and power are restricted end up not\nfully using their intellect and emotions, and that they would not make\nthe choices they make under better conditions, as Elster\u2019s\n\u201csour grapes\u201d phenomenon predicts. Wilson concludes that\nthe view that women have deformed desires is a more plausible\nhypothesis than the view that women have different preferences from\nmen and get what they really value.\n\nBut the debate goes on amongst philosophers. Harriet Baber comes close\nto suggesting that women do not have deformed desires or adaptive\npreferences (Baber 2007). Baber argues against Nussbaum\u2019s view\nthat disadvantaged women who have adaptive preferences might get what\nthey want when they satisfy these preferences, but they are not better\noff because their desires are deformed. In contrast, Baber believes\nthat adaptation is irrelevant to whether preference-satisfaction\ncontributes to one\u2019s welfare: if I want something, getting it is\ngood for me regardless of how I acquired that desire (110).\nBaber\u2019s explanation for the choices that deprived women make is\nthat they are making the best of a bad situation, choosing not\nnecessarily what they would prefer all things considered, but rather\nwhat they would prefer given their options. While Nussbaum believes\nthat Jayamma, who settles for a low-paying job with poor working\nconditions because she believes this to be her lot in life, lacks a\nconception of herself as a person with rights that can be violated and\na belief that she is wronged, Baber believes that she has just settled\nfor second best, since she would grab a raise if it were offered to\nher (Nussbaum 2000, 113; Baber 111). Similarly, Nussbaum believes that\nVasanti, who stays in an abusive marriage for years, does not see\nherself as having rights that are violated, but has a deformed\npreference to put up with abuse as part of women\u2019s lot, while\nBaber denies that Vasanti has such a preference, suggesting instead\nthat she prefers a bundle that includes putting up with abuse along\nwith having a home and basic necessities (Nussbaum 2000, 68\u201369;\nBaber 113\u2013114). Baber argues further that when women do, in\nfact, acquire adaptive preferences, as is the case with Srey Mom, once\nsold into slavery, who now at least partly wants to remain a\nprostitute when given the chance to go into the community where she\nwill be ostracized, we beg the question if we assume that their\nchoices are uninformed or cooly calculated (121). Baber\u2019s view\nin the end is that it is an empirical question whether the women in\nthe cases described are rational self-interested choosers who make the\nbest of a bad situation, or whether they are damaged by deformed\npreferences. She maintains that they, as well as most members of\ntraditionally disadvantaged groups who succumb to bad treatment, are\nrational self-choosers (122).\n\nWhile most feminists agree that women have deformed desires, they\ndiffer in their views about whether, and to what extent, deformed\ndesires interfere with their bearer\u2019s autonomy. Arguably more\nradical feminists, such as Mary Daly, Andrea Dworkin, and Catharine\nMacKinnon sometimes speak as if all of women\u2019s desires are\ndeformed, and that women\u2019s autonomy is entirely compromised as a\nresult (Daly 1978; Dworkin 1987; MacKinnon 1987b and 1987c). One\nexplanation for why deformed desires take such a hold on women might\nbe the fact that they are tied integrally to an agent\u2019s\nidentity. Sandra Bartky argues that the norms of femininity, for\ninstance, are imposed on women during the construction of their\nsubjectivities rather than when they are fully formed subjects, and\nthat a woman\u2019s conforming to these norms is essential to her\nsense of herself as a sexually desiring and desirable subject such\nthat expecting her not to conform threatens her with at least\ndesexualization (2002, 25). This explanation aside, in other places,\nthese same radical feminists cited above join other feminists in\nsuggesting that only some of women\u2019s desires are deformed, and\nthat women are not entirely under the sway of their deformed desires\nsince these desires can be outweighed by competing desires women have\nfor their own welfare. MacKinnon, for one, suggests that victims of\nsexual harassment find harassment to be devastating to their\nself-respect and health and do not enjoy their harasser\u2019s\nattention, rape victims who appear disinterested are in reality\nsilenced and do not have a desire to be raped, and pornography models\noperate not from free will and a desire to display their bodies in\npornographic poses, but from constraint and inequality (1987a, 54;\n1987d, 114; 1987d, 180 and 194). Writing about date rape, Lois Pineau\nsuggests that women know which sexual encounters are enjoyable, and\nthus consensual, even though they play out patriarchal roles of\ncoyness and submission and men interpret their desires along these\nlines. Although women appear to want to be dominated by men in sex,\nwhat they really find enjoyable is communicative sex where the\npartners seek to know and respect each other\u2019s desires just like\nparticipants in a good conversation (1989, 239). Deep down, Pineau and\nMacKinnon are arguing, women really know what they want and what is\ngood for them despite patriarchy\u2019s influence on them and their\ndesires; they have competing nondeformed desires for their own\nwelfare. Many other feminists seem to be assuming this kind of\nposition when they object to patriarchal practices, since these\npractices are at odds, they believe, with what women want. On this\nview, then, women have deformed desires, but these desires do not have\nsuch a strong hold on their bearer that they cannot be overridden by\nother desires the bearer has for her own welfare. This view holds out\npromise that women can exhibit at least some degree of autonomy in\nfollowing their nondeformed desires, and thus be motivated to act in\nways that do not contribute to their own oppression.\n\nIndeed, Uma Narayan explicitly acknowledges that women under\npatriarchy have both deformed desires and nondeformed desires, and\nbelieves that women can be fully autonomous because they\n\u201cbargain\u201d with patriarchy in the context of both the\nexternal constraints it imposes on women and the internal constraints\nit imposes in the form of deformed desires (2002). Narayan contrasts\nthe \u201cbargainers with patriarchy\u201d with both the\n\u201cdupes of patriarchy,\u201d who completely subscribe to\npatriarchal norms and practices of their culture and impose them on\nthemselves, having none but deformed desires, and the \u201cprisoners\nof patriarchy,\u201d who are constrained against their will and\nconsent by external forces imposed by their culture (418, 422). The\nbargainers with patriarchy, then, face the external constraints of\npatriarchy, and have both deformed and nondeformed desires. Narayan\ntakes as her case study Sufi Pirzada Muslim women who are expected to\nwear a burqua, or, \u201cto veil\u201d (she uses the term\n\u201cveiling\u201d to include burqua-wearing), arguing that they\nare bargainers with patriarchy who in the face of external and\ninternal constraints do what they believe is best for themselves. On\nthis point, her view is similar to Baber\u2019s, though Narayan is\nless dismissive of the reality of deformed desires than is Baber.\nContrary to the popular Western opinion that these women veil because\nthey are duped into patriarchal norms associated with veiling, Narayan\nargues that the situation is more complex, because veiling women\nacknowledge that the burqua is uncomfortable and makes them injury\nprone, worry about their reputation with their families and\ncommunities if they do not veil, and are aware of the economic and\npolitical implications of not veiling. Narayan analogizes their\nsituation to that of Western women who do not want to be seen in\npublic without makeup\u2014both are bargainers with, rather than\ndupes of, patriarchy. Narayan defines autonomy quite liberally, as the\nview that a person is autonomous as long as she is a \u201cnormal\nadult\u201d with no serious cognitive or emotional impairments and is\nnot subject to literal or outright coercion from others (429). Under\nthis definition, the presence of deformed desires does not threaten\ntheir bearer\u2019s autonomy, even if she is partly under their sway,\nso long as they do not seriously impair her. Narayan believes that\nbargainers with patriarchy, such as veiling women, are autonomous\nbecause, despite their choices being constrained by patriarchy, they\ncan make genuine, reflective choices within these constraints. And\neven though their critical abilities, which seem to be at the heart of\nautonomy, can be distorted by patriarchy, sometimes the starkness of\npatriarchal constraints has the opposite effect, causing a person to\nface head on the conflict in her desires and to choose to act in ways\nthat are at odds with patriarchy.\n\nAnother account that challenges the position that adaptive preferences\nautomatically undercut autonomy is defended by Donald Bruckner (2007).\nBruckner objects to Elster\u2019s view of the \u201csour\ngrapes\u201d phenomenon that the fox\u2019s preference change is\nirrational because it is not autonomous, occurring merely through a\ncausal mechanism irrelevant to rationality (307). Bruckner argues that\nboth adaptive preference change and adaptive preference formation are\noften rational. Adaptive preferences are like other preferences in\nthat they guide a person\u2019s deliberation and give her reasons for\naction (311). Bruckner gives the example of Veronica, who initially\nprefers to become an Olympic competitor in tennis, but after years of\npractice realizes that even though she is very talented at tennis, she\nwill not achieve Olympic status, and so downgrades her aspirations and\ncomes to prefer to be a local star, a change in preference that might\noccur behind her back and thus be non-autonomous (313). Bruckner\nbelieves that she should adapt her preferences thusly, as doing so\nwould better promote her own subjective well-being. He argues that\nthere should be a presumption in favor of the normativity of any of\nour preferences, even ones caused by factors out of our control, since\nany of an agent\u2019s preferences are still her own and thus give\nher a reason to act (316). The real test, then, for deformed desires,\nones formed in response to unjust social conditions, is whether they\nare truly the agent\u2019s own, and so autonomously held. On\nBruckner\u2019s account, the agent\u2019s not endorsing her new\npreference upon reflection makes her new preference not fully her own,\nand so irrational. Thus while one condition for the rationality of an\nadaptive preference for Elster is that it be autonomously acquired,\nfor Bruckner, it is that the preference be autonomously retained\n(319). If the agent reflectively endorses her adaptive preference in a\nway that is responsive to her feasible set, and not simply her false\nbeliefs about her feasible set, even though she limits her potential\nand lowers her sights, it is rational for her to retain this\npreference (319\u2013320). Bruckner agrees with Nussbaum that certain\nmoral and political conditions interfere with an agent\u2019s\nrepudiation of her limited desires, and urges that the agent\u2019s\nadaptive preferences count as her own, that is, as autonomous, only if\ncertain moral conditions are met, such as those proposed by\nNussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach that defends the provision of\ncertain capabilities, liberties, and opportunities to all citizens\n(322\u2013323). Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach, unlike\nBruckner\u2019s view, invokes an objective notion of the good.\n\nBruckner\u2019s account of reflective endorsement foreshadows Andrea\nWestlund\u2019s procedural autonomy account, one consistent with a\nsubjective notion of the good (Westlund 2003). Westlund takes up the\ncase of the Deferential Wife (discussed in Section 1 and earlier in\nthis section), who tends not to form her own interests, but when she\ndoes, counts them as less important than her husband\u2019s\npreferences. Westlund\u2019s account is \u201cdialogical,\u201d\naccording to which an autonomous agent has an attitude of\nresponsibility for her self and her commitments, and is prepared to\nengage in a dialogue with herself and (even hypothetical) others who\nhave different, critical perspectives, in order to offer justifying\nreasons for her desires. Westlund argues that the Deferential Wife\nfails this test of autonomy because she fails to give good reasons why\nshe ranks her husband\u2019s preferences higher than her own. But\nanother character, the extreme anti-feminist, who is also deferential,\ncounts as autonomous because she gives proper uptake to queries about\nher deference, even though we might disagree with her reasons for\nbeing so (e.g., the Bible tells her to be subservient to her husband).\nThe procedure of exhibiting genuine dialogical responsiveness rather\nthan offering pat answers or remaining tightly gripped by one\u2019s\ncommitments, and not the content of her desires, determines her\nautonomy.\n\nIn an attempt to bridge the gaps between subjective and objective\ngood, between seeing women with adaptive preferences as full agents\nand as victims, and between respecting women\u2019s autonomous\nchoices and promoting their flourishing, Serene Khader defends a\nperfectionist definition of adaptive preferences (Khader 2011).\nKhader\u2019s definition invokes objective value in the form of basic\nflourishing that is defined by some actual (not hypothetical)\ncross-cultural deliberative process. She defines adaptive preferences\nas those that are inconsistent with basic flourishing, are formed\nunder conditions nonconducive to basic flourishing, and that we\nbelieve people might be persuaded to transform when they scrutinize\nthem and are exposed to conditions more conducive to flourishing (42).\nThis definition is both procedural and substantive, because it\nidentifies preferences as adaptive according to the conditions under\nwhich they are formed, as well as the content of the preferences\nthemselves. The underlying premise is the \u201cFlourishing\nClaim\u201d that when people have options for flourishing, they tend\nto choose in ways that promote their flourishing (51). By\n\u201cflourishing,\u201d Khader means \u201cbasic\nflourishing,\u201d or flourishing at a minimal level rather than\nexcellence, since the object is to get cross-cultural agreement.\nBeyond this, she keeps the concept vague, intending for it to include\nthings like adequate nutrition (62\u201363). Khader also wants to\nseparate \u201cinappropriately adaptive preferences,\u201d which are\nharmful to their bearers and adapted to bad social conditions, from\nmerely adaptive preferences, which may not have these features\n(52\u201353). She cautions that we cannot read off preferences from\nbehavior, because, in agreement with Narayan and Baber, she believes\nthat women might simply be making the best of available options.\n\nUnlike feminists who locate the main problem with adaptive preferences\nas lying with their obstruction of the agent\u2019s autonomy, Khader\nrejects the view of adaptive preferences as autonomy deficits. She\nagrees that adaptive preferences can block the well-being of those who\nhave them, but she argues that both procedural and substantive\nautonomy accounts either yield results that do not square with our\nintuitions, or commit us to invoking policies that are coercive and so\nanti-liberal. The general charge against procedural autonomy accounts\nis that they inevitably sneak in an objective notion of the good when\nthey are supposed to be neutral, and that those who fail them are\nbelieved to lack mental capacities to understand or scrutinize their\nchoices. The general charge against substantive autonomy accounts is\nthat they inevitably involve disrespect for cultural diversity, with\nthe result that those who fail them are deemed to have bad values that\nrender inoperative their capacities to scrutinize their preferences\n(105). Either way, autonomy accounts have it that those with adaptive\npreferences are unable to make their own decisions, which is false and\ncondescending (103, 105).\n\nAside from their connection to autonomy, deformed desires can harm\ntheir bearer by functioning as one factor, possibly the most damaging\none, in psychological oppression. In general, psychological\noppression, as Sandra Bartky defines it, is to be weighed down in\none\u2019s mind, to have a harsh dominion exercised over one\u2019s\nself-esteem, or \u201cto internalize intimations of\ninferiority\u201d (Bartky 1990b, 22). Psychological oppression\ncontributes to a group\u2019s oppression in various ways. It can hide\nthe badness of oppressors and the beneficiaries of oppression by\nmaking them and their actions appear legitimate and by allowing them\nto carry on without overt acts of violence that they would otherwise\nuse to maintain a group\u2019s oppression (Bartky 1990b, 23).\nPsychological oppression contributes to a group\u2019s oppression\nalso by molding the oppressed and co-opting them so that their choices\nand decisions harm them while benefiting the privileged, thereby\nsustaining the system of oppression. Women\u2019s coming to prefer\nthe kinds of social roles that tend to subordinate them will make them\nless able to choose or give them fewer choices to make (Cudd 2006,\n157, 181).\n\nIn addition to the role deformed desires play in psychological\noppression, acting on some deformed desires can compromise the\nbearer\u2019s moral agency. Consider again the case of the\nDeferential Wife described above: her deformed desire is that she\nwants to be servile to her husband and children. A debate surfaced in\nthe philosophical literature about how to explain the wrongness of the\nDeferential Wife\u2019s servility, and each explanation revealed that\nservility was problematic for moral agency. Thomas Hill attributes the\nproblem to confusion about her rights\u2014how they can be waived and\nwhen they can be forfeited\u2014with the result that the Deferential\nWife fails to acknowledge her own moral status and to see her rightful\nplace in the moral community (1973). Marilyn Friedman attributes the\nproblem to the Deferential Wife\u2019s uncritically deferring to her\nhusband\u2019s preferences by failing to assess them in accord with\nher own principles, merely satisfying his wishes and whims taken as\ngiven, and becoming an accomplice to his goal-seeking behavior. Her\nlack of effective moral judgment makes her less than a whole person\nwho exhibits moral integrity (1985, 146\u2013147). Marcia Baron\nattributes the problem to the Deferential Wife\u2019s lacking a\ncritical examination of her reasons for deferring to her\nhusband\u2019s preferences (1985, 398). Each of these explanations is\ncommitted to the thought that acting on a desire to be servile can\ncompromise moral agency. This, too, is significant for oppression,\nsince those whose moral agency is compromised in these ways are easily\nexploitable (see Hampton, 1993).\n\nFeminists have identified other harmful modes of psychological\noppression aside from deformed desires. Stereotyping delivers messages\nof inferiority that the stereotyped can come to believe about\nthemselves and then live up to. Stereotyping contributes to\npsychological oppression by threatening a person\u2019s\nself-determination (Bartky 1990b, 23\u201324). Philosophers and\nothers have recently identified the phenomenon of \u201cstereotype\nthreat,\u201d which is the idea that members of subordinate groups to\nwhom stereotypes are applied, when made aware of the stereotypes prior\nto performing a task such as taking a test, underperform on that task\nbecause they are preoccupied by fears of confirming those stereotypes\n(Saul 2013, 41). Cultural domination, or being forced to see things\nfrom the perspective of a socially dominant group, cultivates feelings\nof incapability and denies the values and experiences of the oppressed\n(Bartky 1990B, 25). Sexual objectification psychologically oppresses\nwomen because it splits a woman into two parts, identifying her as a\nmere bodily part or function, thereby inferiorizing her (Bartky 1990b,\n26). Terror, brought about from violence and the threat of violence,\ninhibits coping strategies in everyday living, contributes to\npsychoses and neuroses, lessens trust in others, and makes victims\nwithdraw and become less likely to strike back (Cudd 2006,\n159\u2013160). False consciousness, which is the set of false beliefs\nformed under and supportive of oppression, such as the belief that a\nwoman\u2019s place is in the home, maintains harmful stereotypes and\nthereby perpetuates oppression (Cudd 2006, 178\u2013179). Members of\noppressed groups often experience feelings of humiliation,\ndegradation, shame, and low self-esteem in response to stereotyping,\nunequal treatment, harassment, and social distancing. These feelings\ndiminish confidence and reinforce stereotypes of weakness,\nvulnerability, and inferiority (Cudd 2006, 163\u2013165).\nPhilosophers such as Samantha Brennan have recently identified another\ncontributor to psychological oppression, that of microinequities\n(Brennan 2013). Brennan defines microinequities as small, unjust or\nundeserved inequalities that fall short of full-blown inequities only\non the basis of their size (184). They are ways in which persons, due\nto features such as gender and race, are singled out, or overlooked,\nignored, or otherwise discounted (184, citing Sandler 1986, 3). They\nare covert, often unintentional, unrecognized by the one who commits\nthem, and hard to prove (Brennan 184, citing Rowe 2008, 45).\nMicroinequities have a cumulative negative effect: they affect your\nself-value and self-esteem directly as well as indirectly, when few\nmembers of the group make it to the top because of the microinequities\nthemselves (1880. Thus, feminists have shown that not only deformed\ndesires, but these and other similar factors operate through\nwomen\u2019s own psychology to help sustain their own oppression.\n",
