    "main_text": "Applications || Internalism/Externalism\n5.2 Internalism/Externalism\n\nDistinctions between internalism and externalism arise in many areas\nin philosophy\u2014philosophy of mind, philosophy of language,\nepistemology, and ethics. All of these distinctions can be\ncharacterized by means of supervenience theses. For example, an\ninternalist about mental content accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat what a mental state is about supervenes upon neurophysiological\nproperties, or \u201cwhat\u2019s in the head.\u201d The dispute is\nabout whether two thinkers can differ in the contents of their mental\nstates without also differing in some neurophysical respect.\nSimilarly, an internalist about epistemic justification accepts, and\nan externalist denies, that whether a belief is justified supervenes\nupon the mental properties of the believer. The dispute is about\nwhether two believers can differ in whether their beliefs are\njustified without also differing in some mental respect. And an\ninternalist about moral motivation accepts, and an externalist denies,\nthat moral motivation supervenes upon moral judgment. The dispute is\nabout whether two (rational) people can differ in how they are\nmotivated to act without also differing in their judgments about which\nof those actions they ought to perform.\n\nRelatedly, supervenience can also be used to capture the traditional\ndistinction between internal and external relations. As Lewis has\nnoted (1986b, 62), an internal relation (such as being taller\nthan) supervenes on the intrinsic natures of its relata. An\nextrinsic relation (such as being 3 kilometers from ) does\nnot. The main difference between this case and those above is that\nhere there is no real dispute about whether the supervenience thesis\nholds or not; it is widely agreed that there are two kinds of\nrelations.\n",
