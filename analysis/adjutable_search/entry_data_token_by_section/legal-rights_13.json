    "main_text": "Legal Rights as Reasons\n8. Legal Rights as Reasons\n\nAs explained, rights often figure in law as legal reasons in favor of\ncertain legal holdings and rules (including other legal rights). Most\nobviously, legal officials incorporate legal rights in their\ndeliberations as to what the law is in a particular case. As such,\nunder the view of \u201cright as reason\u201d, legal rights are not\nthe outcomes of legal deliberation on what the law is, but rather are\namong the legal reasons for such outcomes. Take for example the case\nof Gannett Co. v. DePasquale (1979). Weighing the First\nAmendment right to freedom of the press against considerations of\nthe common good and defendants\u2019 rights to a fair trial, the\ncourt held that:\n\n\n[t]he right of access to courtroom proceedings, of course, is not\nabsolute. It is limited both by the constitutional right of defendants\nto a fair trial \u2026 and by the needs of government to obtain just\nconvictions and to preserve the confidentiality of sensitive\ninformation and the identity of informants.
