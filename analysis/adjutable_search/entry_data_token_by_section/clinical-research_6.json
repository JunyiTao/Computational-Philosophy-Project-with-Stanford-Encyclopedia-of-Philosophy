    "main_text": "Minimal Risks\n7. Minimal Risks\n\nLimits on risks are a central part of almost all current research\nregulations and guidelines. With respect to those who can consent,\nthere is an essentially implicit agreement that the risks should not\nbe too high (as noted earlier, some argue that there should not\nbe any net risks to even competent adults in the context of so-called\ntherapeutic research). However, there is no consensus regarding how to\ndetermine which risks are acceptable in this context. With respect to\nthose who cannot consent, many commentators argue that clinical\nresearch is acceptable when the net risks are very low. The challenge,\ncurrently faced by many in clinical research, is to identify a\nstandard, and find a reliable way to implement it, for what\nconstitutes a sufficiently low risk in this context. An interesting\nand important question in this regard is whether the level of\nacceptable risks varies depending on the particular class of\nindividuals who cannot consent. Is the level of acceptable risks the\nsame for individuals who were once competent, such as previously\ncompetent adults with Alzheimer disease, individuals who are not now\nbut are expected to become competent, such as healthy children, and\nindividuals who are not now and likely never will be competent, such\nas individuals born with severe cognitive disabilities?\n\nSome argue that the risks of clinical research qualify as sufficiently\nlow when they are \u2018negligible\u2019, understood as risks that\ndo not pose any chance of serious harm (Nicholson 1986). Researchers\nwho ask children a few questions for research purposes may expose them\nto risks no more worrisome than that of being mildly upset for a few\nminutes. Exposing participants to a risk of minor harm for the benefit\nof others does not seem to raise ethical concern. Or one might argue\nthat the ethical concerns it raises do not merit serious ethical\nconcern. Despite the plausibility of these views, very few studies\nsatisfy the negligible risk standard. Even routine procedures that are\nwidely accepted in pediatric research, such as single blood draws,\npose some, typically very low risk of more than negligible harm.\n\nOthers (Kopelman 2000; Resnik 2005) define risks as sufficiently low\nor \u2018minimal\u2019 when they do not exceed the risks individuals\nface during the performance of routine examinations. This standard\nprovides a clear and quantifiable threshold for acceptable risks. Yet,\nthe risks of routine medical procedures for healthy individuals are so\nlow that this standard seems to prohibit intuitively acceptable\nresearch. This approach faces the additional problem that, as the\ntechniques of clinical medicine become safer and less invasive,\nincreasing numbers of procedures used in clinical research would\nmove from acceptable to unacceptable. And, at a theoretical level, one\nmight wonder why we should think that the risks we currently happen to\naccept in the context of clinical care for healthy children should\ndefine the level of risk that is acceptable in clinical research. Why\nthink that the ethical acceptability of a  blood draw in\npediatric research depends on whether clinicians still use blood draws\nas part of clinical screening for healthy children?\n\nMany guidelines (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005;\nAustralian National Health and Medical Research Council 1999) and\ncommentators take the view that clinical research is ethically\nacceptable as long as the net risks do not exceed the risks\nindividuals face in daily life. Many of those involved in clinical\nresearch implicitly assume that this minimal risk standard is\nessentially equivalent to the negligible risk standard. If the risks\nof research are no greater than the risks individuals face in daily\nlife, then the research does not pose risk of any serious harm. As an\nattitude toward many of the risks we face in daily life, this view\nmakes sense. We could not get through the day if we were conscious of\nall the risks we face. Crossing the street poses more risks than one\ncan catalog, much less process readily. When these risks are\nsufficiently low, psychologically healthy individuals place them in\nthe cognitive background, ignoring them unless the circumstances\nprovide reason for special concern (e.g. one hears a siren, or sees a\nlarge gap in the sidewalk).\n\nPaul Ramsey reports that members of the US National Commission often\nused the terms \u2018minimal\u2019 and \u2018negligible\u2019 in a way\nwhich seemed to imply that they were willing to allow minimal risk\nresearch, even with children, on the grounds that it poses no chance\nof serious harm (Ramsey 1978). The members then went on to argue that\nan additional ethical requirement for such research is a guarantee of\ncompensation for any serious research injuries. This approach to\nminimal risk pediatric research highlights nicely the somewhat\nconfused attitudes we often have toward risks, especially those of\ndaily life.\n\nWe go about our daily lives as though harms with very low probability\nare not going to occur, effectively treating low probability harms as\nzero probability events. To this extent, we are not Bayesians about\nthe risks of daily life. We treat some possible harms as impossible\nfor the purposes of getting through the day. This attitude, crucial to\nliving our lives, does not imply that there are no serious risks in\ndaily life. The fact that our attitude toward the risks of everyday\nlife is justified by its ability to help us to get through the day\nundermines its ability to provide an ethical justification for\nexposing research participants to the same risks in the context of\nnon-beneficial research (Ross & Nelson 2006).\n\nFirst, the extent to which we ignore the risks of daily life is not a\nfully rational process. In many cases, our attitude regarding risks is\na function of features of the situation that are not correlated\ndirectly with the risk level, such as our perceived level of control\nand our familiarity with the activity (Tversky, Kahneman 1974;\nTversky, Kahneman 1981; Slovic 1987; Weinstein 1989). Second, to the\nextent that the process of ignoring some risks is rational, we are\ninvolved in a process of determining which risks are worth paying\nattention to. Some risks are so low that they are not worth paying\nattention to. Consideration of them would be more harmful (would cost\nus more) than the expected value of being aware of them in the first\nplace.\n\nTo some extent, then, our attitudes in this regard are based on a\nrational cost/benefit analysis. To that extent, these attitudes do not\nprovide an ethical argument for exposing research participants to\nrisks for the benefit of others. The fact that the costs to an\nindividual of paying attention to a given risk in daily life are\ngreater than the benefits to that individual does not seem to have any\nrelevance for what risks we may expose them to for the benefit of\nothers. Finally, there is a chance of serious harm from many of the\nactivities of daily life. This reveals that the \u2018risks of daily\nlife\u2019 standard does not preclude the chance of some participants\nexperiencing serious harm. Indeed, one could put the point in a much\nstronger way. Probabilities being what they are, the risks of daily\nlife standard implies that if we conduct enough minimal risk research\neventually a few participants will die and scores will suffer\npermanent disability.\n\nAs suggested above, a more plausible line of argument would be to\ndefend clinical research that poses minimal risk on the grounds\nthat it does not increase the risks to which participants are\nexposed. It seems plausible to assume that at any given time an\nindividual will either be participating in research or involved in the\nactivities of daily life. But, by assumption, the risks of the two\nactivities are essentially equivalent, implying that enrollment in the\nstudy, as opposed to allowing the participant to continue to\nparticipate in the activities of daily life does not increase the\nrisks to which he is exposed.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the risks of research often are\nadditive rather than substitutive. For example, participation in a\nstudy might require the participant to drive to the clinic for a\nresearch visit. The present defense succeeds to the extent that this\ntrip replaces another trip in the car, or some similarly risky\nactivity in which the participant would have been otherwise involved.\nIn practice, this often is not the case. The participant instead may\nsimply put off the trip to the mall until after the research visit. In\nthat case, the participant\u2019s risk of serious injury from a car\ntrip may be doubled as a result of her participation in research.\nMoreover, we accept many risks in daily life because the relevant\nactivities offer those who pursue them a chance of personal benefit.\nWe allow children to take the bus because we assume that the benefits\nof receiving an education justify the risks. The fact that we accept\nthese risks given the potential benefits provides no reason to think\nthat the same risks or even the same level of risk would be acceptable\nin the context of an activity which offers no chance of medical\nbenefit. Finally, applied strictly, this justification seems to imply\nthat investigators should evaluate what risks individuals would face\nif they did not enroll in the research, and enroll only those who\nwould otherwise face similar or greater levels of risk.\n",
