    "main_text": "Skepticism about Needs and Common Response Strategies || Insufficiently Objective\n2.1 Insufficiently Objective\n2.1.1 Are we Able to Compose a List of Needs that is Sufficiently Objective to Ground Relevant Obligations?\n\n\nFor need to play the fundamental normative role that its advocates\nenvisage, it seems essential that there should be a consensus on what\npeople really need. However, looking around at what people\nclaim to need, we seem to be confronted with diverse,\nsometimes conflicting, possibilities. Consider, for instance, how\nmembers of a Bedouin tribe may claim to need some camels, pita bread,\ngood copies of the Koran, and swords, in order to live a minimally good\nlife. By contrast, so-called Millennials living in New York might claim\nthat good Internet access, technological connectivity, and reliable\nmass transit systems are fundamental to their well-being. The\nconcern here is that we will be unable to derive one robust list of\nneeds that captures this variety, and is applicable to all\npeople. Even if we limit our focus to one particular society we\nwill note that there is still enormous variety in what people claim to\nneed. Some may claim to be unable to enjoy life without music,\nart, long walks in natural habitats, or a large group of like-minded\nfriends. Others might see no value in this list of reported\nessentials. Faced with such claims, how can real needs be\nidentified?\n2.1.2 Can Needs be Sharply Distinguished from Desires, Wants or Preferences?\n\n\nPhilosophers who write about the concept of need are keen to emphasize\nhow needs differ from desires, wants, and preferences: we often want\nthings that we do not need, and equally we may not want what we need\nbecause we fail to recognize its importance to us (all of this seems\nabundantly clear when we observe the eating patterns of many young\nchildren). Since, in general, we only have weak reasons to satisfy\npeople\u2019s desires and preferences, this contrast seems important\nif we want to maintain that meeting claims of need is morally\nobligatory (see e.g. Miller 2014, 20\u201322).\n\n\nYet on further reflection we may begin to doubt whether such a\ncategorical separation between needs and wants is feasible.  This\nrelates back to the first set of concerns already mentioned in\n2.1.1. We might observe that some things we once considered to be more\naptly described as preferences, desires or wants have widely come to\nbe thought of as needs. Examples of this phenomenon might include\naccess to computers, the Internet, television sets, refrigeration, and\ncentral heating, which are widely thought of as among the necessities\nof modern life. Given these changes over time concerning what is\nregarded as a need, the suspicion may arise that a need is nothing\nmore than a desire whose satisfaction has become socially expected,\nand therefore lacks the special moral force that its defenders claim\nfor it. \n",
