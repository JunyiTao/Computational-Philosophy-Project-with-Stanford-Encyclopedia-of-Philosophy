    "main_text": "Contemplative Philosophical Methods || The Triple Process and the Means of Nondual Knowledge\n4.2 The Triple Process and the Means of Nondual Knowledge\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara embraces particular verbal methods to understand\npropositions affirming nonduality crystallized in pithy\nUpani\u1e63adic sentences. (Post-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaitins focused\non four such \u201cgreat sentences\u201d\n[mah\u0101v\u0101kyas]). These methods include continuity and\ndiscontinuity (anvaya and vyatireka), secondary\nindication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), and negative language\n(neti neti). \u015aa\u1e45kara does not clearly codify these\nseparately, but it may be most accurate to describe his primary method\nas continuity and discontinuity (see, e.g., GKBh 13.13).\nPost-\u015aa\u1e45kara Advaitins often discuss his method as\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 instead; however, \u015aa\u1e45kara\nappears to view all three as varying iterations of a single\nmethod.\n\nAnvaya and vyatireka is a method of discriminative\nreasoning to determine the relationship of what persists and what does\nnot persist between two things. It reveals whether one term is\nindependent of another. For example, in the analogy of the clay and\nits forms (see\n \u00a72.1\n above), when a particular form of clay (such as a pot) occurs, then\nclay occurs (continuity). And when that particular form (pot) is\nabsent (discontinuity) after being shaped into a plate, then clay\nstill occurs. One may apply this method, for example, to consciousness\nand mental states. Consciousness is continuous through the\ndiscontinuous states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep and never\nsubject to its negative instance of discontinuity. Consciousness\nitself can never be absent. One cannot escape from one\u2019s own\nconsciousness, nor can one directly separate a particular mental state\nfrom consciousness because consciousness itself is not mutually\nexclusive of anything and not subject to the negative instance of\nvyatireka. However, separating consciousness and a particular\nmental state is possible through anvaya and\nvyatireka because the states themselves are mutually\nexclusive. For example, dream reality and waking reality are mutually\nexclusive, pointing to the fact that consciousness is independent of\nthem even as it persists through both. (See Cardona 1981;\nSatchidanandendra 1964 [1989]; Halbfass 1991: 162\u201377; Comans\n1996: 59\u201363; and Mayeda 1992: 51\u201358 on anvaya and\nvyatireka).\n\nMah\u0101v\u0101kyas like \u201cI am Brahman\u201d\n(B\u1e5bU 1.4.10: aha\u1e43 brahm\u0101smi) or \u201cYou\nare that\u201d (ChU 6.8.7: tat tvam asi) are identity\nstatements that form an equation consisting of two or more\nco-referential terms in grammatical apposition. The equation\u2019s\nlack of logical congruence\u2014identifying the limited individual\n(aham) with nondual brahman, or you (tvam)\nwith that (tat) universe for example\u2014contradict\nsyntactical expectancy. This prods the reader to use the\nanvaya and vyatireka method to resolve the equation.\nIn the case of \u201cYou are that\u201d, tvam negates the\nmediacy of tat as existence external to one\u2019s Self. And\ntat negates any subjective limitations to the consciousness\nreferred to in tvam. The apposition thus restricts what does\nnot persist between the two terms to reveal what is continuous and\nnumerically identical\u2014namely pure consciousness and\nundifferentiated existence. The identity statement reveals that you\n(tvam), the pure consciousness which is the underlying\nexistence of the individual, is that (tat) pure existence\nwhich is the metaphysical ground of all objects. Existence and\nconsciousness are one, not two. There is no distinction between the\nam-ness of one\u2019s self and the is-ness of objects. (See ChUBh\nch.6 and US ch.18 for \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s interpretation of\n\u201cYou are that\u201d).\n\nLak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\u2019s indirect implication employs\na theory of metonymy which distinguishes between literal denotative\nmeanings and implied connotative meanings. The contradictory\njuxtaposition of an identity statement such as \u201cYou are\nthat\u201d triggers a particular form of secondary implication in\nwhich a portion of the primary meaning is rejected while another part\nis retained. The canonical Advaita example is, \u201cThis (person\nthat you see now) is that Devadatta (whom you knew in the\npast)\u201d. Here, the primary referents of \u201cthis\u201d and\n\u201cthat\u201d cannot be identical because \u201cthis\u201d and\n\u201cthat\u201d refer to different locations and times, Devadatta\nin the past somewhere else and Devadatta here and now. The two\nDevadattas are not completely identical because of their relationships\nto time and place, nor are they completely separate. The import of the\nsentence creates a cognition of a single Devadatta substantive that is\nnot connected to a specific time or place. (See Lipner 1997; Bartley\n2002: 111\u201323; Suthren Hirst 2005: 145\u201351; Kunjunni Raja\n1969: 251\u201354, and the entry on the\n literal-nonliteral distinction\n for further discussions of indirect implication).\n\nNeti neti (negative language) literally means \u201cnot\n(this), not (this)\u201d. Its negation targets the discontinuity\naspect by stripping away all qualifications to personal identity and\nthe external world. This process removes false superimpositions of\nbody, senses, and mind previously attributed to brahman.\nNegative language attempts to avoid defining absolute reality as a\nthing in the world. It denies any nameability of brahman, its\ngrammatical object. This is directly tied to brahman\u2019s\nunobjectifiable status, for the hermeneutical premise of\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s negative language is the inability of\npredicates to apply to absolute reality. To give positive predicates\nwould reify the absolute to a finite entity (on this see B\u1e5bUBh\n2.3.6).\n\nNeti neti negates all properties, conceptions, limitations,\nand identities attributed to brahman; however, it cannot lose\nall reference. Passages using negative language may push their object\naway, allowing the unobjectifiable object to continually slip back and\nbeyond; however, the purpose is not open ended. Negation strips away\nall false conceptions, including one\u2019s tendency to grasp after\nthe absolute, without lapsing into nihilism or an infinite regression\n(BrS\u016bBh 3.2.22). What appears to be an illogical infinite regress\nof negation is harnessed as a semantic force for understanding the\nabsolute. Negative language turns onto itself as well, negating its\nprior negation and its own referential delimitations. When all\nconceptions of \u201cI\u201d as \u201cthis\u201d or\n\u201cthat\u201d are negated, then one\u2019s self is understood to\nbe nondual consciousness.\n\nNegative language usually constitutes half of a paradox that affirms\npositive and negative propositions at the same time. Textual instances\nof negation usually follow positive statements about brahman\nwhich provide an explicit positive proposition of continuity. There is\na positive assertion of an entity but the negative language strips\nthat entity of any limitations or finite objectivity. This methodology\nthreads the needle of indicating brahman\u2019s presence\nwithout objectifying it. It ensures that the reader neither grasps at\nan object nor falls into nihilism. The negative assertions of neti\nneti, which follow or imply a positive assertion, parallel the\nother two methods. Lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 and\nanvaya-vyatireka similarly depend on negation\nthrough mutual restriction, while simultaneously indicating the\nintrinsic nature of brahman without falling into\nnihilism.\n",
