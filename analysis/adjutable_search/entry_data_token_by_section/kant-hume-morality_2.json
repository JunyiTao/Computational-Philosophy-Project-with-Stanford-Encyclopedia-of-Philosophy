    "main_text": "Reason and Emotion in Morality\n3. Reason and Emotion in Morality\n\nKant, as discussed above, underwent a decisive change of mind about\nthe views of Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume. Early in his career, he\nendorsed core aspects of their approach, but Kant\u2019s mature work\nis organized around the idea that reason, rather than feeling\nor emotion, is the highest authority in the moral domain. In this\nrespect, many features of his moral philosophy are fundamentally\nopposed to Hume\u2019s. We can see this opposition in their\nrespective accounts of moral judgment and moral motivation. A careful\nlook at these topics, however, also highlights sentimentalism\u2019s\nresidual influence on Kant.\n\nAccording to Hume, moral judgments typically concern the character\ntraits and motives behind human actions. To make a moral judgment is\nto detect, by means of a sentiment, the operation of a virtuous or\nvicious quality of mind. The sentiment here is a\n\u201cpeculiar\u201d kind of feeling\u2014namely, a feeling of\napproval (love, pride) or disapproval (hatred, humility) (T 3.3.1.3).\nWe call the traits that elicit our approval \u201cvirtues\u201d, and\nthose that elicit our disapproval \u201cvices\u201d. Sentiments of\napproval and disapproval are passions, but they tend to be \u201csoft\nand gentle\u201d and therefore easily mistaken for thoughts or ideas\n(T 3.1.2.1). The real story is that \u201cmorality\u2026 is more\nproperly felt than judg\u2019d of\u201d (T 3.1.2.1). Reason and\nexperience are required for determining the likely effects of a given\nmotive or character trait, so reason does play an important role in\nmoral judgment. Yet reason\u2019s role is subordinate. It is one\nthing to say that a given trait tends to be useful or conducive to\npleasure and quite another to say that it is \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d. The moral value of a trait is conferred by the\nsentiment of approval, which \u201cgilding and staining all natural\nobjects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises, in\na manner, a new creation\u201d (EPM App. I.21). Hume argues, however,\nthat only those sentiments experienced from a \u201cgeneral point of\nview\u201d count as genuinely moral (T 3.1.2.4). For example, a\nperson might hate or envy the courage of her enemy but this is not\nnecessarily a moral response. The moral sentiment is\nexperienced when she considers her enemy\u2019s courage from a\n\u201cgeneral point of view\u201d (T 3.1.2.4). When a person\nconsiders things from this point of view, she looks upon them as a\n\u201cjudicious spectator\u201d, who is disinterested but still\nemotionally responsive to the scene she beholds (Cohon 2008:\n126\u201358). Rather than eliminating her sentiments, the judicious\nspectator enlarges them by means of sympathy, which enables her to\nresent the misery of others or rejoice in their happiness. (On\nsympathy, see Owen 2009 and Taylor 2015: 189\u201394.)\n\nKant offers a very different account of moral judgment. He focuses on\nthe first-person judgments an agent (not a spectator) must make about\nhow to behave. In his view, the primary question is what the moral law\npermits, forbids, or requires. Passion or sentiment cannot answer such\na question. Instead, answering it requires an operation of\nreason by means of which the agent determines whether her\nprinciple or \u201cmaxim\u201d of conduct conflicts with the moral\nlaw. Because she is an imperfect and finite rational being, the law\npresents itself to her as a \u201ccategorical imperative\u201d (CI).\nIt is an imperative because it commands and constrains us; it is\ncategorical because it commands and constrains us with ultimate\nauthority and without regard to personal preferences or any\nempirically contingent ends (G 4:413\u201320). The two best known\nformulations of the CI are the formula of universal law (FUL), which\ncommands, \u201cact only in accordance with that maxim through\nwhich you can at the same time will that it become a universal\nlaw\u201d (G 4:421), and the formula of the end in itself (FEI),\nwhich commands, \u201cSo act that you use humanity, whether in\nyour own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time\nas an end, never merely as a means\u201d (G 4:429). Scholars\ndisagree about the relationship between these two formulations of the\nCI, as well as their relationship to the other formulations Kant\nprovides. There is also disagreement about whether FUL or FEI has\nprimacy in deliberation and moral judgment. Kant claims that FUL is\nthe standard everyone actually employs in moral judgment (G 4:402;\nCPrR 5:69), and some scholars defend its primacy (e.g., Engstrom\n2009). Others argue in favor of FEI, emphasizing, in particular, its\nrole in the Metaphysics of Morals, where FEI seems to play\nthe fundamental role in guiding judgment about specific ethical duties\n(e.g., Wood 1999).\n\nSome passages from Kant\u2019s work seem to suggest that moral\njudgment requires no experience, no knowledge of human nature and\nlocal custom, and no emotional sensitivity. A rational being equipped\nwith the correct formal procedure has all she needs. Yet such passages\nare misleading when read in isolation. This is not Kant\u2019s view\nof how human beings do, or even should, make moral judgments (Wood\n2008: 56). First, application of the CI typically requires auxiliary\nor subordinate \u201cprinciples of application\u201d, which must be\ntaken from our empirical knowledge of human nature (MM 6:217). Second,\nKant frequently emphasizes that no formal procedure could specify all\nthe principles for applying higher-order principles. Principles of\napplication help us apply higher order principles to concrete\ncircumstances, but there is no substitute for experience and\n\u201cjudgment\u201d, which is a knack or uncodifiable talent\n(A138/B172). The need for judgment explains why the practice of\ncasuistry is \u201cwoven into ethics\u201d (MM 6:411). Furthermore,\nthe wider the duty, the more latitude for individual judgment and\nexperience (MM 6:390). Finally, Kant believes that moral judgment\nrequires emotional sensitivity and an understanding of social\nconvention. For example, without these, one might be unable to\ndetermine whether a particular act of beneficence is more\ncondescending than kind (MM 6:453), or to prevent friendly banter from\nsliding into disrespectful mockery (MM 6:467). Proper moral judgment\nin such circumstances requires attunement to the feelings of others,\nbut also facility with the social conventions that shape the dynamics\nof personal interaction.\n\nKant and Hume fundamentally disagree on the question of reason\u2019s\nauthority. Hume assigns reason to a subordinate role, while Kant takes\nreason to be the highest normative authority. However, it is important\nnot to misunderstand the nature of their opposition. Hume offers an\nempirical explanation of the moral judgments made in \u201ccommon\nlife\u201d, which he takes to be part of his broader science of human\nnature. This is his focus. By contrast, though Kant makes observations\nabout the \u201ccommon\u201d use of reason in morality (e.g., G\n4:399), this is not his focus. He says relatively little about what is\ngoing on in our heads or the surrounding social environment when we\nmake moral judgments. As noted above, Kant at least entertained the\npossibility that sentimentalism provides the best empirical\nexplanation of our patterns of approval and disapproval (NF 19:117\n#6626). What Kant insists on is that such responses can be justified\nonly by pure reason, which is the only faculty capable of\nunderstanding the unconditional necessity of the moral law\u2019s\ncommands. Emotion or feeling plays a crucial role in guiding our\napplication of the law to particular maxims in concrete circumstances,\nbut feeling\u2019s role is fully subordinate to reason\u2019s\n(Sensen 2017: 135\u2013137).\n\nA similar contrast between Hume and Kant can be found in their\nrespective accounts of moral motivation. Hume famously claims that\n\u201cReason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and\ncan never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey\nthem\u201d (T 2.3.3.4). The claim is not that reason has no role in\nhuman action, but rather that its role is entirely subordinate to\npassion. Hume offers three main arguments for this claim in A\nTreatise of Human Nature. There is considerable debate about how\nthese arguments work, the precise nature of Hume\u2019s famous\nanti-rationalism, and whether his position changed from the\nTreatise to the second Enquiry. (See, e.g., Milgram\n1995; Radcliffe 1997 and 2018; Cohon 2008: chapters 2 and 3; and Irwin\n2008: chapter 26.)\n\nAccording to the first argument, \u201creason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will\u201d (T 2.3.3.1). Abstract (or\ndemonstrative) reasoning, which involves a priori inferences\nand judgments pertaining to relations of ideas, cannot influence the\nwill, but only assist us in our pursuit of an end we already have. For\nexample, probable reasoning helps us discover causal relations among\nobjects of experience conducive to the realization of pre-selected\nends, but such information about cause and effect can never motivate\naction on its own: \u201cIt can never in the least concern us to\nknow, that such objects are causes, and such others effects, if both\ncauses and effects be indifferent to us\u201d (T 2.3.3.3). In order\nto be motivated to act, we must first anticipate pleasure or pain from\nsomething. That anticipated pleasure or pain gives rise to feelings of\ndesire or aversion for the object in question. Probable reasoning\nallows us to discern the causes of this object; our positive or\nnegative feelings about the object then spread to the causes of it;\nand we are then motivated to pursue or to avoid them. Simply believing\nthat one thing causes another will not motivate action (T\n2.3.3.2).\n\nA second argument, which builds on the first, aims to show that reason\n\u201ccan never oppose passion in the direction of the will\u201d (T\n2.3.3.1). The only thing that can oppose an impulse to action\ngenerated by one passion is a contrary impulse. Reason, then, could\ncounteract an impulse to action generated by a passion if and only if\nreason could itself generate a contrary impulse. But from the first\nargument, we know that that reason cannot generate such an impulse.\n\u201cThus it appears, that the principle, which opposes any passion,\ncannot be the same with reason, and is only called so in an improper\nsense\u201d (T 2.3.3.4). Hume goes on to say that whatever we feel in\nus running contrary to an impulse to act that we mistake for reason\nmust be something else, such as a calm passion (e.g., a general\nappetite for the good, benevolence, or aversion to evil; T\n2.3.3.8).\n\nThe third argument claims that a passion is an \u201coriginal\nexistence\u201d, not an idea, or a mental copy of another object.\nContradiction to truth and reason \u201cconsists in the disagreement\nof ideas, consider\u2019d as copies, with those objects, which they\nrepresent\u201d (T 2.3.3.5). Therefore, a passion cannot be contrary\nto truth and reason. Passions cannot, strictly speaking, be evaluated\nas reasonable or unreasonable, despite our practice of calling\npassions unreasonable or irrational when they depend in some way on\npoor reasoning or false beliefs. Later in the Treatise, Hume\nextends this argument to volitions and actions as well (T 3.1.1.9). We\nmight view Kant\u2019s conflict in conception and contradiction in\nwill tests of the formula of universal law to constitute refutations\nof the latter argument (G 4:421\u201324; see Guyer 2008: ch. 5).\n\nHume draws important anti-rationalist moral conclusions from this line\nof thought. One obvious implication is that reason cannot be the\nmotive to moral action; if reason cannot motivate any action,\nit cannot motivate moral action. A second further conclusion is that\nmorality and its basic principles cannot be grounded in reason. This\none follows both from his views about the \u201cinertness\u201d of\nreason generally, and from his assumption that morality has real\nmotivational power: \u201cMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent\nactions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The\nrules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of reason\u201d (T\n3.1.1.6).\n\nKant never directly addresses the above arguments, but he clearly\nrejects Hume\u2019s claim that reason is motivationally\n\u201cimpotent\u201d or enslaved to the passions. It is a central\nfeature of his moral philosophy that pure reason can be\n\u201cpractical\u201d\u2014that reason can \u201cof itself,\nindependently of anything empirical, determine the will\u201d (CPrR\n5: 42). He says of right actions that they \u201cneed no\nrecommendation\u201d from emotion or personal inclination. Such\nactions \u201crepresent the will that practices them as the object of an\nimmediate respect, and nothing but reason is required to\nimpose them upon the will\u201d (G 4:435). Moreover, in the first\nsection of the Groundwork, Kant repeatedly emphasizes the\nspecial form of \u201cmoral worth\u201d that attaches to right\nactions that are performed simply because they are right\u2014i.e.,\nactions motivated from \u201cfrom duty\u201d or \u201cfrom respect\nfor the law\u201d (G 4:396\u2013401; see Timmermann 2009a).\n\nDespite his emphasis on the motivational efficacy of pure reason,\nKant\u2019s discussion of respect makes clear that feeling plays an\nimportant role in human moral motivation (see Guyer 2008: ch. 5; and\nGuyer 2010). Early in the Groundwork, Kant describes respect\nin a manner that makes it sound like a felt aspect of the law itself:\n\u201can action from duty is to put aside entirely the influence of\ninclination, and with it every object of the will; hence there is left\nfor the will nothing that could determine it the except objectively\nthe law and subjectively pure respect for this\npractical law\u201d (G 4:400). However, his subsequent account makes\nrespect sound more like a separate feeling that arises from\nreason:\n\n\nBut although respect is a feeling, it is not one received by means of\ninfluence; it is, instead, a feeling self-wrought by a\nrational concept and therefore specifically different from all\nfeelings of the first kind, which can be referred to inclination or\nfear. What I cognize immediately as a law for me, I cognize with\nrespect, which signifies merely consciousness of the subordination of\nmy will to a law without the mediation of other influences on any\nsense. Immediate determination of the will by means of the law and the\nconsciousness of this is called respect, so that this is\nregarded as the effect of the law on the subject, and not as\nthe cause of the law. (G 4:401 n; also see 460)\n\n\nEven though we cannot know (or \u201cmake intelligible a\npriori\u201d) how a thought or judgment about the morality of an\naction \u201ccan itself produce a sensation of pleasure or\npain\u201d, Kant thinks that this somehow does happen; it must, if\nmoral considerations are to be motivating in beings like us. The\nphenomenology of respect is unusual, as it involves both pain and\npleasure (or something like it). There is the humiliation an agent\nfeels when the moral law strikes down her self-conceit; but respect\nalso feels invigorating and ennobling, since the moral law comes from\nthe agent\u2019s own reason and represents her higher self and\nvocation (CPrR 5:73).\n\nHowever one interprets the phenomenology, respect seems to function as\nan intermediary between reason and the will. This raises questions\nabout the consistency of Kant\u2019s view, since he argues repeatedly\nthat pure reason can, and should, determine the will\n\u201cimmediately\u201d. For this and other reasons, scholars are\ndivided on how to interpret Kant\u2019s treatment of respect.\nAccording to an \u201cintellectualist\u201d line of interpretation,\nrespect is the effect of pure reason\u2019s motivational\ninfluence on the will. In other words, we grasp the law by means of\nreason, are moved to act accordingly, and feel respect as a result of\nbeing so moved. According to an \u201caffectivist\u201d approach,\nhowever, respect is the proximate cause of reason\u2019s\ninfluence on the will. In other words, our rational grasp of the\nlaw\u2019s demand produces a feeling of respect or reverence, which\nthen moves the will (or higher faculty of desire). Vexingly, both\ninterpretations have a strong textual basis and both have been\ndefended with great skill and insight. (For an excellent discussion of\nthe issues, see Frierson 2014: ch. 4; see also Sensen 2017, especially\n129\u2013134. On the various forms of respect and the different roles\nthey play, see Williamson 2018.)\n\nIn the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant argues that additional\nfeelings also play a role in motivating virtuous conduct. He lists\nmoral feeling, conscience, love of human beings, and respect (for\noneself) as special kinds of feelings of which we are made aware only\nthough consciousness of the moral law (MM 6:399). Kant describes these\nas \u201cmoral endowments\u201d that \u201clie at the basis of\nmorality\u201d or the \u201csubjective conditions of\nreceptivity to the concept of duty\u201d (MM 6:399). Since our\ncompliance with duty presupposes our having these feelings, there is\nno duty for us to have them. However, because of their\nindispensability to human morality, there is a duty to cultivate them.\nAdditionally, Kant clearly sees moral value in some sensibly-grounded\n(\u201cpathological\u201d) feelings (MM 6:456\u201357, 458; also M\n29:626; NF 19:77 #6560). Speaking of sympathy, which is perhaps the\nbest example of this sort of feeling, Kant says \u201cit is\u2026 an\nindirect duty to cultivate the natural\u2026 feelings in us, and to\nmake use of them as so many means to sympathy based on moral\nprinciples and the feeling appropriate to them\u201d (MM 6:457).\n\nSympathy allows us better to understand others\u2019 needs, helps us\nto communicate our concern for them, and can act as an additional\nincentive to facilitate our promotion of our happiness helping others.\nSuch sensibly-grounded feelings can work with rationally-grounded\nfeelings to motivate action. We may cultivate sympathetic feelings\nfrom respect for the law, and then find these feelings prompting us to\nact in certain ways. In this context, where the focus is on virtue,\nKant sounds closer to Hume than he is often taken to be. Indeed,\naccording to one prominent interpretation, careful consideration of\nthis and other relevant material highlights at least a few \u201cdeep\naffinities\u201d between Kant on Hume on motivation and practical\nreason (Guyer 2008: 164). Yet the affinities should not be overstated.\nKant\u2019s view of sympathy is appreciative but wary, and sympathy for him\ndoes not play the prominent role it plays for Hume. (On Kant\u2019s view of\nthe upsides and downsides of sympathy, see Sorensen 2018. Cf.\nSayre-McCord 2015 on sympathy\u2019s role in Hume\u2019s theory of moral\njudgment.)\n\nDespite several surprising similarities, Kant and Hume clearly\ndisagree on the basic question of whether pure reason, to use\nKant\u2019s expression, can be motivationally efficacious. Kant\nthinks it can, while Hume does not. However, one must interpret this\ndisagreement with care. First, Kant\u2019s account of respect makes\nclear that feeling or emotion is involved even when pure reason\nmotivates action. The \u201caffectivist\u201d interpretation of\nrespect, in particular, suggests that Kant and Hume may agree that\nreason cannot motivate action without the intervention of feeling.\n(For a similar point about the French and British moral rationalists\nHume probably read, see Radcliffe 2019.) The crucial difference\nbetween them is that Kant believes pure reason capable of producing a\nmotivationally efficacious feeling (respect), while Hume believes\nnothing of the sort. The opposition between them is even starker if\nthe \u201cintellectualist\u201d interpretation of Kantian respect is\ncorrect. Second, Kant\u2019s account of virtue makes it clear that\nfeelings such as love and sympathy often play an important moral role\nin the motivation of human action. Indeed, feelings appear to be\nindispensable for human beings and should therefore be cultivated and\nstrengthened through deliberate practice.\n\nOne must also keep track of the level at which these two philosophers\ndisagree. Consider, for example, the reason why Hume would adamantly\nreject Kant\u2019s attribution of a special form of \u201cmoral\nworth\u201d to actions done \u201cfrom duty\u201d. According to\nHume,\u201cno action can be virtuous, or morally good, unless there be\nin human nature some motive to produce it, distinct from a sense of\nits morality\u201d (T 3.2.1.7). To avoid circularity, there must be a\nmotive to virtuous action that does not itself refer to the moral\ngoodness of the act (T 3.2.1.4). For Hume, the only time one would\nhave to rely on one\u2019s sense of the goodness of an act to\nmotivate oneself to do it is when one is deficient in the natural\nfeelings that ordinarily prompt people to act morally (e.g., natural\naffection, generosity, gratitude). The two philosophers do not\nnecessarily disagree on the empirical question of what\nactually motivates people. Note that Hume seems to countenance the\npossibility of being motivated directly by the sense of an\naction\u2019s moral goodness. Kant, in fact, seems comparatively\nskeptical; he expresses doubt that there have ever been human actions\nmotivated from duty alone (e.g., G 4:406\u2013407). They disagree\nsharply, however, on the normative question at issue. Kant\nbelieves that the most morally admirable actions are performed\n\u201cfrom duty\u201d alone. These are the only actions that have\ntrue \u201cmoral worth\u201d. By contrast, Hume believes that such\nactions indicate a character flaw. Indeed, if a person finds she is\nmoved to act only by the sense that the action is good, she may very\nwell reproach herself for a lack of generosity or gratitude, for\nexample, and consequently form a desire to change her character.\n",
