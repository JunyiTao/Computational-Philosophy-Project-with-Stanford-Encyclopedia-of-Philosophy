    "main_text": "Four Traditions || Semantic Twist Accounts\n4.1 Semantic Twist Accounts\n\nSemantic Twist Accounts hold that metaphor results from the\ninteraction or interanimation of words and word meanings as they are\nbrought together and act on each other in the settings provided by\nparticular utterances made on particular concrete occasions.\n\nWhen we take an uttered sentence as a metaphor, we assign it a new and\ndistinctively metaphorical meaning. The assignment of fresh\nmeaning to the sentence as a whole results from a more local\nassignment of fresh meaning to one or more of the sentence\u2019s\nconstituent words or phrases, the ones we take metaphorically, the\nfocal words or phrases. The meanings assigned the remainder\nof the sentence, the framing words or phrases, remain\nunchanged. (Here it\u2019s taken for granted that whatever meanings\nmay be, they obey a compositionality principle, according to\nwhich the meaning of a complex expression is a function of the\nmeanings of its elementary components and the manner in which those\ncomponents are woven together by the complex expression\u2019s\nsyntax.)\n\nThe frame isn\u2019t a passive bystander to changes in the\ninterpretation of the focus: it induces and controls these changes.\nWhen we attempt to take each and every part of the sentence in the\nmost literal and straightforward way possible, there proves to be\nsomething deviant, incongruous, or otherwise out of\norder\u2014something semantically or pragmatically inappropriate,\nsomething incoherent at worst and strained at best\u2014about how we\nmust then take the sentence as a whole. If unstrained, coherent,\ncontextually appropriate sense is to be made of the sentence as a\nwhole, something\u2019s gotta give. What in fact does give\nis our straightforward literal understanding of the focal expressions.\nThe meanings of these expressions undergo a metaphorical\ntwist, a twist produced by the more unyieldingly literal meanings\nof the expressions that serve as the metaphor\u2019s frame.\n\nMetaphor results from a kind of tension between the literal meanings\naccruing to the focus and the literal meanings accruing to the frame,\na tension which disappears when we alter the meanings accruing to the\nfocus just enough to make it disappear. Paraphrase is an\neffort to re-express the new metaphorically determined sentence\nmeaning in more literal or at least, less ambitiously metaphorical\nterms. Influential early semantic twist accounts were provided by I.A.\nRichards (1936), Max Black (1954), and Monroe Beardsley (1962).\n\nAn especially lucid and careful version was offered later on by the\nliterary scholar Harold Skulsky (1986, 1992). Skulsky maintains that\nwhen a speaker speaks figuratively, he switches from ordinary\nvernacular English to an improvised dialect, a metaphorese,\nthat is richer than the vernacular in the speech act potentials it\naccords certain particular sentence forms, the meanings it accords\ncertain particular words or phrases, or both. The listener must master\nthis dialect on the spot and on the fly, treating the speaker\u2019s\ntiny specimen of correct usage as her main clue to how it differs from\nthe familiar vernacular. We have willful and challenging linguistic\ninnovation on the part of a speaker, followed by a resourceful\nstruggle to keep up on the part of a listener, \u201ca distinctive\nkind of cooperative activity halfway between a game and a rite\u201d\nthat requires and thereby elicits a special cognitive rapport between\nthe two parties (1992, 24).\n\nFiguration occurs only when:\n\n(a) The speaker\u2019s utterance proves gratuitously\n\u201cconfusing\u201d as long as we attempt to interpret it in\naccord with established vernacular rules assigning speech act\npotentials to sentence forms and meanings to words or phrases.\n\n\n(b) Speaker and listener alike are well acquainted with a shared stock\nof methods for equipping sentence forms with temporary non-vernacular\nspeech act potentials (schemes) and words and phrases with temporary\nnon-vernacular meanings (tropes). Schemes and tropes provide ways of\nbeing conventionally unconventional in our employment of language.\n\n\nMany schemes and tropes are such that the innovations they license at\na given point depend on what\u2019s mutually understood to be the\ncase for present communicative purposes, what\u2019s implicitly taken\nto be true or at least truistic, at the point where the\ninnovation occurs. Any such assumption is what Skulsky calls a\ntalk postulate. Something may be a talk postulate because\nit\u2019s so widely and firmly believed as to be obvious (and\nobviously obvious), because we\u2019re assuming it for the time being\nfor purposes of argument, or simply because it\u2019s something we\nroutinely pretend to believe in particular conversational settings.\nThe crucial points are three:\n\n(a) Talk postulates needn\u2019t be believed, either by people in\ngeneral or by the parties to the particular conversation at hand.\n\n\n(b) It is talk postulates, not the actual or presumed beliefs of the\nparticipants, that determine what can and can\u2019t be intelligibly\nasserted, ordered, asked, etc. in a given conversational setting.\n\n\n(c) Talk postulates are and need to be community property, with the\nconsequence that the broader the community is in which they are to\nfunction, the harder it becomes to modify them by means of individual\nconversational moves.\n\n\nThe conventional vernacular use of a declarative form like \u201cYou\nlaughed\u201d is to assert and thereby inform you that you just now\ndid just that\u2014laugh. But asserting this to you or informing you\nof it is out of the question if you\u2019ve just burst out laughing\nat a funeral; under the circumstances, your laughter can\u2019t\nconceivably come as news to you. A scheme, call it the scheme\nof rebuke, enables me to use this sentence form in a\nconventionally unconventional manner to blame you for your\nlaughter or scold you for your laughter when (and because)\ninforming you of it is manifestly out of the question.\n\nA trope, by contrast, is a recipe for turning out new word or\nphrase meanings when none of the vernacular ones will do. Hyperbole\nand metonymy may be understood as tropes in this sense, and so can\nmetaphor:\n\nConsider what the murderers say when Macbeth asks if they\u2019re\nkindly disposed toward their oppressor: \u201cWe are men, my\nliege\u201d [3.1.96]. \u2026 The sentence as uttered is pointlessly\ntrue; but this time [unlike the laughing at a funeral case], what\nneeds reinterpreting isn\u2019t the vernacular force of the sentence;\nasserting is a good move after a question. Here the culprit is\n\u201cmen,\u201d which can\u2019t be taken at face value. In\ncontext the vernacular meaning has to yield to another one related to\nit in some familiar way, maybe by a loose kind of implication. When it\ncomes to feelings about oppressors, the relevant truism or folklore\nassumption about being men is that they\u2019re the kind of creatures\nthat keep track both of injuries and chances to get even.\n\u201cMen\u201d here means creatures like that. (1992, 9\u201310)\n\n\nHere being G is an implication of being F in a\nparticular conversational setting just in case it readily follows from\ntalk postulates conspicuously active there that whatever is F\nis also G. In the Macbeth case, whatever is a man is such\nthat he keeps track of injuries and is ready to avenge himself on\nthose who injure him whenever he can. The recipe for metaphor, then,\nmight read something like this:\n\nIf being F is what it would take for the term T to\napply in some conversationally salient vernacular sense, and being\nG is an implication of being F given the talk\npostulates active in the current conversational setting, then being\nG will be what it takes for T to apply in one\navailable temporary, non-vernacular, metaphorese sense. Whether\nT actually takes on this sense depends on how T is\nbest disambiguated in metaphorese given the current\nconversational setting.\n\n",
