    "main_text": "Formal Accounts || The Ramsey Sentence\n4.1 The Ramsey Sentence \n\nThe Ramsey sentence of a theory TC in the language \\(L(V_o,V_t)\\) is obtained by the following two transformations of the conjunction of T- and C-axioms. First, replace all theoretical symbols in this conjunction by higher-order variables of appropriate type. Second, bind these variables by higher-order existential quantifiers. As result one obtains a higher-order sentence of the following form: \\[\\tag{\\(\\TC^R\\)} \\exists X_1 \\ldots \\exists X_n \\TC(n_1 , \\ldots ,n_k, X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n)\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(X_1 , \\ldots ,X_n\\) are higher-order variables. This sentence\nsays that there is an extensional interpretation of the theoretical\nterms that verifies, together with an antecedently given\ninterpretation of the observation language \\(L(V_o)\\), the axioms\nTC. The Ramsey sentence expresses an apparently weaker\nproposition than TC, at least in standard truth-conditional\nsemantics. If one thinks that the Ramsey sentence expresses the\nproposition of a scientific theory more properly than TC, one\nholds the Ramsey view of scientific theories.\n\nWhy should one prefer the Ramsey view to the standard one? Ramsey\n([1929] 1931: 231) himself seemed to have a contextual theory of\nmeaning in mind when proposing the replacement of theoretical terms\nwith appropriate higher-order variables:\n\n\nAny additions to the theory, whether in the form of new axioms or\nparticular assertions like \\(\\alpha(0, 3)\\) are to be made within the\nscope of the original \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\). They are not,\ntherefore, strictly propositions by themselves just as the different\nsentences in a story beginning \u2018Once upon a time\u2019 have not\ncomplete meanings and so are not propositions by themselves.\n\n\n\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) figure in this explanation as\ntheoretical terms to be replaced by higher-order variables. Ramsey\ngoes on to suggest that the meaning of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\)\nis the difference between\n\n\\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\)\n\n\nand\n\n\\((\\TC \\wedge A)^R\\)\n\n\nwhere A stands for the set of observation sentences\nbeing asserted and (...)\\(^R\\) for the operation of Ramsification,\ni.e., existentially generalizing on all theoretical terms. This\nproposal of expressing theoretical assertions clearly makes such\nassertions dependent upon the context of the theory TC.\nRamsey ([1929] 1931: 235n) thinks that a theoretical assertion\n\\(\\phi\\) is not meaningful if no observational evidence can be found\nfor either \\(\\phi\\) or its negation. In this case there is no stock\nA of observation sentences such that (1) and (2)\ndiffer in truth value.\n\nAnother important argument in favor of the Ramsey view was given later\nby Sneed (1979: ch. III). It is easy to show that Sneed\u2019s\nproblem of theoretical terms (which concerns relations and functions)\ndoes not arise in the first place on the Ramsey view. For \\(\\TC^R\\)\nonly says that there are extensions of the theoretical terms such that\neach axiom of the set \\(A(\\TC)\\) is satisfied in the context of a\ngiven interpretation of the observational language. No claim, however,\nis made by \\(\\TC^R\\) as to whether or not the sentences of \\(A(\\TC)\\)\nare true. Nonetheless, it can be shown that \\(\\TC^R\\) and TC\nhave the same observational consequences:\n\n\nProposition 1. For all \\(L(V_o)\\) sentences \\(\\phi\\),\n\\(\\TC^R\\) \\(\\vdash \\phi\\) if and only if \\(\\TC \\vdash \\phi\\), where\n\\(\\vdash\\) designates the relation of logical consequence in classical\nlogic.\n\n\nHence, the Ramsey sentence cannot be true in case the original theory\nTC is not consistent with the observable facts. For a\ndiscussion of empirical adequacy and Ramsification see Ketland\n(2004).\n\nOne difficulty, however, remains with the Ramsey view. It concerns the\nrepresentation of deductive reasoning, for many logicians the primary\nobjective of logic. Now, Ramsey ([1929] 1931: 232) thinks that the\n\u2018incompleteness\u2019 of theoretical assertions does not affect\nour reasoning. No formal account, however, is given that relates our\ndeductive practice, in which abundant use of theoretical terms is\nmade, to the existentially quantified variables in the Ramsey\nsentence. We lack a translation of theoretical sentences (other than\nthe axioms) that is in keeping with the view that the meaning of a\ntheoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) is the difference between \\((\\TC \\wedge\nA \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A)^R\\). As Ramsey observes, it\nwould not be correct to take \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) as\ntranslation of a theoretical sentence \\(\\phi\\) since both \\((\\TC\n\\wedge A \\wedge \\phi)^R\\) and \\((\\TC \\wedge A \\wedge \\neg \\phi)^R\\)\nmay well be true. Such a translation would not obey the laws of\nclassical logic. These laws, however, are supposed to govern deductive\nreasoning in science. A proper semantics of theoretical terms should\ntake the semantic peculiarities of these terms into account without\nrevising the rules of deductive reasoning in classical logic.\n\nThere thus remains the challenge of relating the apparent use of\ntheoretical terms in deductive scientific reasoning to the Ramsey\nformulation of scientific theories. Carnap was well aware of this\nchallenge and addressed it using a sentence that became labeled later\non the Carnap sentence of a scientific theory (Carnap 1958;\n1966: ch. 23): \n\n\\[ \\tag{\\(A_T\\)} \\TC^R \\rightarrow \\TC.\\]\n\n\nThis sentence is part of a proposal to draw the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction at the global level of a scientific theory (as this\ndistinction proved not to be applicable to single axioms): the\nanalytic part of the theory is given by its Carnap sentence \\(A_T\\),\nwhereas the synthetic part is identified with the theory\u2019s\nRamsey sentence in light of Proposition 1. Carnap (1958) wants \\(A_T\\)\nto be understood as follows: if the Ramsey sentence is true, then the\ntheoretical terms be interpreted such that TC comes out true\nas well. So, on condition of \\(\\TC^R\\) being true, we can recover the\noriginal formulation of the theory in which the theoretical terms\noccur as constants. For, obviously, TC is derivable from\n\\(\\TC^R\\) and \\(A_T\\) using Modus Ponens.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of standard truth-conditional semantics, however,\nthis instruction to interpret the Carnap sentence appears arbitrary,\nif not even misguided. For in standard semantics, the Ramsey sentence\nmay well be true without TC being so (cf. Ketland 2004).\nHence, the Carnap sentence would not count as analytic, as Carnap\nintended. Carnap\u2019s interpretation of \\(A_T\\) receives a sound\nfoundation in his (1961) proposal to define theoretical terms using\nHilbert\u2019s epsilon operator, as we shall see in\n Section 4.3.\n",
