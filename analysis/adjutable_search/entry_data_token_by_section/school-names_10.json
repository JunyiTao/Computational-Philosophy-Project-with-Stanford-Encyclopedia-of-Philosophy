    "main_text": "Gongsun Long || \u201cWhite Horse is Not Horse\u201d\n7. A Daoist Critique\n\nAmong Warring States texts, only two show any familiarity with the\ndetails of Hui Shi\u2019s and Gongsun Long\u2019s theses. (The\n\u201cUnder Heaven\u201d book of the Zhuangzi, the major\nsource for our discussion of Hui Shi, dates probably from the first\nfew decades of the Han dynasty.) One is the Xunzi, which as\nwe saw ascribes a list of seven paradoxes to Hui Shi and Deng Xi, as\nwell as alluding elsewhere (22.3) to the white horse sophism. The\nother is the famous \u201cDiscourse on Equalizing Things,\u201d Book\n2 of the Zhuangzi, though the text does not attribute the\ntheses to Hui Shi or Gongsun Long by name. \u201cEqualizing\nThings\u201d is critical of the disputers\u2019 ideas and in one\npassage explicitly criticizes Hui\n Shi.[24]\n But it also praises his intelligence and is not downright hostile\ntoward him, as Xunzi is. \n\n\u201cEqualizing Things\u201d alludes to versions of at least four\nof Hui Shi\u2019s theses and to both the white horse and the\n\u201cindicating\u201d sophisms. \u201cToday go to Yue and arrive\nyesterday\u201d is cited as an analogy for something impossible or\ncontradictory. \u201cJust as it is alive, it is dying\u201d is used\nfor rhetorical effect to support the point that judgments of what is\n\u201cthis\u201d (shi) and \u201cnot this\u201d\n(fei) arise together, are relative to each other, and can be\nreversed or shifted. After arguing that anything can be deemed\n\u201cthis\u201d or \u201cnot this,\u201d the text critiques\nGongsun Long: \n\nUsing indicating to show that indicating is not indicating is not as\ngood as using not-indicating to show that to indicating is not\nindicating. Using a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not\nas good as using what is not a horse to show that a horse is not a\nhorse. Heaven and earth are one \u201cindicated\u201d; the myriad\nthings are one horse. (cf. Graham 1981: 53)\n\n\nInstead of using a white horse as an example to show that it\u2019s\npossible to treat some horses as not of the kind horse, it\nwould be simpler and clearer to use something of another kind, such as\nan ox, and show that some horses can be treated as \u201cthe\nsame\u201d as that thing and different from other horses. For\ninstance, draft horses could be deemed \u201cthe same\u201d as oxen,\ngrouped together with them as draft animals, and distinguished as\ndifferent from riding horses or racehorses. For that matter, anything\nand everything can be summed into a whole and deemed a single\n\u201cindicated\u201d or \u201chorse.\u201d The text\u2019s point\nis to trivialize Gongsun Long\u2019s theses. For some purpose or\nother, by some standard or other, white horse can indeed be considered\ndifferent from horse. But in light of the pragmatic stance adopted by\n\u201cEqualizing Things,\u201d there is nothing puzzling or\nremarkable about this. \n\nThese allusions place \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d firmly within\nthe intellectual milieu of the disputers. Indeed, the text argues\nexplicitly for a view closely related to one of their signature\nthemes\u2014\u201cdeeming so the not-so, admissible the\ninadmissible.\u201d \n\nAdmissible? Admissible. Inadmissible? Inadmissible. A dao\n(way) is formed by walking it, things are made so by calling them so.\nHow are they so? They are so in respects where they are so. How are\nthey not so? They are not so in respects where they are not so. Things\ninherently have respects in which they are so; things inherently have\nrespects in which they are admissible. No thing is not so; no thing is\nnot admissible. (cf. Graham 1981: 53)\n\n\nStill, the text\u2019s stance is fundamentally critical of Hui Shi\nand Gongsun Long. In a trenchant critique, the writer mocks several\nHui Shi-style theses, including spatial and temporal paradoxes and a\nversion of the \u201cone unit\u201d view: \n\n\u201cIn the world, nothing is bigger than the tip of an autumn hair,\nyet Mount Tai is small; nothing outlives a dead child, yet Pengzu [the\nChinese Methulesah] died young. Heaven and earth were born together\nwith me, and the myriad things and I are one.\u201d\n\n\nHaving already become one, can you still say anything? Having already\ncalled it \u201cone,\u201d can you succeed in not saying\nanything? One and the saying make two; two and the one make three.\nGoing on from here, even an expert calculator can\u2019t get to the\nend of it, much less an ordinary person! So in moving from nothing to\nsomething, we arrive at three; how much worse in moving from something\nto something! Better not to move any particular way at all, but simply\nadapt what we deem shi (right) to the particular situation.\n(cf. Graham 1981: 56)\n\n\nThe text questions the coherence of the \u201ceverything is\none\u201d view. To treat the myriad things and oneself as\n\u201cone\u201d is already to distinguish them from nothing, on the\none hand, and from what is not one, on the other. Indeed, the\nproponent of the \u201cone unit\u201d view cannot even state his\nposition consistently. Merely to say that everything is\n\u201cone\u201d is to recognize something else besides the one,\nnamely our statement pointing it out. The one and the name we give it\nor what we say about it already make two. And as soon as we notice\nthat we\u2019ve got two, we\u2019ve already got three\u2014the one,\nwhat we said about it, and the \u201ctwo\u201d comprising the one\nand what we said. The playful mockery has an underlying point. The\n\u201call is one\u201d view is not more \u201creal\u201d or more\njustified than other schemes of distinctions, and it is useless as a\nsolution to the problem of what scheme of distinctions to adopt in\nguiding life and action. It yields no normative guidance\u2014not\neven Hui Shi\u2019s \u201ccomprehensively care for all\nthings.\u201d Instead of attempting to find the\n\u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201creal\u201d scheme of action-guiding\ndistinctions, our energy would be better spent simply by guiding and\njustifying our actions contextually, responding to the needs of each\nparticular situation as it arises. \n\nLike Hui Shi, then, the writer of \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d\nagrees that distinctions can be drawn in indefinitely many ways. It is\nalso true that if no distinctions are drawn, things in themselves\n\u201cconnect into one.\u201d Yet focusing one\u2019s attention\neither on establishing some particular scheme of distinctions or on\nthe \u201cone\u201d shows an equal lack of insight.\nDisputation\u2014whether in defense of Confucian ritual, Mohist\ninclusive care, the Great One, or sophistical paradoxes\u2014is\nbeside the point. Issues addressed in disputation cannot and need not\nbe settled in order to live well. In fact, they may even interfere\nwith the conduct of a good life. When we perform activities at which\nwe genuinely excel\u2014those whose performance engenders the deeply\nsatisfying experience of feeling fully at home in the world\u2014what\nguides us is not knowledge of fixed, explicit standards of\nshi/fei, nor identification with the \u201cone.\u201d It is\na combination of skill and a kind of uncodifiable knack for adapting\nto the particular situation. \n\nSo in deeming things \u201cthis\u201d (shi), whether you\nbring up a stalk or a pillar, a hag or a beauty, the odd or bizarre,\nDao (the Way) connects them as one.\u2026Only one who has\narrived knows to connect things as one. Deeming things\n\u201cthis\u201d he does not use; instead he accommodates things in\nthe ordinary. He adapts his \u201cthis\u201d to the situation,\nthat\u2019s all. Adapting without knowing things are so is called\n\u201cDao.\u201d (cf. Graham 53)\n\n\nBy contrast, wearing out one\u2019s wits deliberately deeming things\none, as Hui Shi does, instead of simply seeing and making use of the\ninnumerable ways they can be taken to be the \u201csame,\u201d is\nlike forcefully affirming that seven equals four plus three without\nalso allowing that it equals three plus four (cf. Graham 54). It is a\nway of grasping part of the right view, but darkly, without insight.\n\n\nAs for Hui Shi, \u201cEqualizing Things\u201d concludes, \u201cHis\nknow-how almost reached the pinnacle, so his reputation carried on\nuntil later years. It was only in that he was good at it [disputation]\nthat he was different from other people. Because he was good at it, he\ndesired to clarify it. It was not the sort of thing that can be\nclarified, yet he tried to clarify it. Thus he spent his whole life in\nthe obscurity of hard and\n white.\u201d[25]\n\n",
