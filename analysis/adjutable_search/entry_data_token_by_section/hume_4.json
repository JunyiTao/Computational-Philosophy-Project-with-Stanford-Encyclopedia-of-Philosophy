    "main_text": "Account of the Mind || The Copy Principle\n4.1 The Copy Principle\n\nIn the Treatise, Hume qualifies his claim that our ideas are\ncopies of our impressions, making clear that it applies only to the\nrelation between simple ideas and simple\nimpressions. He offers this \u201cgeneral proposition\u201d,\nusually called the Copy Principle, as his \u201cfirst\nprinciple \u2026 in the science of human nature\u201d:\n\n\nAll our simple ideas in their first appearance are deriv\u2019d from\nsimple impressions, which are correspondent to them, and which they\nexactly represent. (T 1.1.1.7/4)\n\n\nHe presents the principle as something that everyone\u2019s\nexperience confirms, but he also gives an argument to establish\nit.\n\nHe argues first that there is a one\u2013to\u2013one correspondence\nbetween simple ideas and simple impressions. He can\u2019t\nprove that this correspondence holds universally, since he\ncan\u2019t examine every individual impression and idea. But he is so\nconfident the correspondence holds that he challenges anyone who\ndoubts it to produce an example of a simple impression without a\ncorresponding simple idea, or a simple idea without a corresponding\nsimple impression. Since he is certain they will fail, he concludes\nthat there is a constant conjunction between simple\nimpressions and simple ideas.\n\nNext, he maintains that this constant conjunction is so universal that\nthe correspondence can\u2019t be a matter of chance. There must be a\ncausal connection between them, but do ideas cause impressions or do\nimpressions cause ideas?\n\nFinally, he argues that experience tells us that simple impressions\nalways precede and thus cause their corresponding ideas. To support\nthis claim, he appeals to two sorts of cases. First, if you want to\ngive a child an idea of the taste of pineapple, you give her a piece\nof pineapple to eat. When you do, you are giving her an impression of\nthe pineapple\u2019s taste. You never go the other way round. His\nother case involves a person born blind, who won\u2019t have ideas of\ncolor because he won\u2019t have impressions of color.\n\nThe Copy Principle is an empirical thesis, which he emphasizes by\noffering \u201cone contradictory phenomenon\u201d as an empirical\ncounterexample to the principle. He imagines someone who has had the\nsame sorts of experiences of colors most of us have had, but has never\nexperienced a certain shade of blue. Hume thinks that if he orders all\nthe shades of blue he has experienced from the darkest to the\nlightest, he will see immediately that there is a gap where the\nmissing shade should be. Then he asks\n\n\nWhether \u2018tis possible for him, from his own imagination, to\n\u2026 raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade,\ntho\u2019 it had never been convey\u2019d to him by his senses? I\nbelieve there are few but will be of opinion that he can; and this may\nserve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always deriv\u2019d\nfrom the correspondent impressions; tho\u2019 the instance is so\nparticular and singular, that \u2018tis scarce worth our observing,\nand does not merit that for it alone we shou\u2019d alter our general\nmaxim. (T 1.1.1.10/6)\n\n\nHume repeats the case of the missing shade almost verbatim in the\nfirst Enquiry. While scholars have wondered exactly how the\nperson might supply the missing shade, he seems unconcerned with the\ndetails. For Hume, once again the exception proves\nthe\u2014empirical\u2014rule.\n",
