(See\nthe edition by Musawi 2003; see also Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n92\u20133.)  It is divided into seven sections. Here as always logic\nis the first topic to be discussed, but h\u0323ads is not mentioned\nat all in the section on logic. It does however figure in the seventh\nand final section, which deals with psychology. In line with some\ntrends of the time, Ibn Kammuna here ranks \u201cthe science of the\nsoul\u201d as the most sublime of the sciences, because the human\nsoul is analogous to the deity.\n\n\nThe fifth \u201cquery\u201d of the final section focuses upon the\ncognitive capacities of the human soul. These vary from person to\nperson, just as bodily endowments vary. However, at the high end of\nthe spectrum, there exists a human soul whose cognitive ability is for\nall practical purposes unlimited. At this level, human cognition is a\n\u201ctaste\u201d of the divine. Ibn Kammuna explains:\n\n\nOnly someone who has experienced (literally \u201ctasted\u201d) the\ntrue reality of the divine fragrances can represent these things to\nhimself. But from among the souls that do not attain this by means of\ntheir innate disposition, some do [manage to] acquire it, whereas\nothers are not able to acquire anything at all. Whosoever abandons\nbodily excesses, makes the best of necessities, and keeps away from\npeople [by living] in mountaintops and empty spaces, thinking about\nthe fine points of divine wisdom, intensely and purely devoted to Him,\nand at times singing about this in well-known harmonious melodies,\nwith poetic speech, about the greatness of God Most High\u2014he will\nreceive some of the divine pleasures, such that are impossible to\ndescribe, and speech is too restricted to express; that is, if he is\nendowed to accept this path. All of this is known through experience\nto the person who finds it within himself, and by recurrence along\nwith intuition to the one who is endowed (Musawi 2003, p. 85\ntranslation by the author).\n\n\nHere as elsewhere, h\u0323ads is paired to tajriba\n(\u201cexperience\u201d) and is described as an innate gift. Here,\nhowever, Ibn Kammuna adds adds an important point. Those who did not\nreceive the gift of h\u0323ads at birth can get a taste of the\ndivine if they cultivate the Sufi methods of isolation, mediation,\nmusic and prayer.\n",
