    "preamble": "\n\nWilhelm Windelband (1848\u20131915) was a German neo-Kantian\nphilosopher. He is considered the founding father of the Baden (or\nSouthwest) school of Neo-Kantianism. The Baden school included his\nstudent and successor at Heidelberg, Heinrich Rickert\n(1863\u20131936), and Rickert\u2019s student Emil Lask\n(1875\u20131915) as its core members. Alongside his contemporary\nHermann Cohen (1842\u20131918)\u2014the founder of the Marburg\nschool of Neo-Kantianism\u2014Windelband is a central proponent of\nthe anti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant that became dominant in\nGerman academic philosophy from the 1880s onwards, and that\nconstituted the backbone of \u201corthodox\u201d neo-Kantianism in\nthe late nineteenth century.\n\nWindelband\u2019s main philosophical contribution consists in\nreformulating Kant\u2019s transcendental approach in terms of a\n\u201cphilosophy of values\u201d that focuses philosophical analysis\non questions of normativity. Although Windelband thinks of his project\nas an anti-metaphysical \u201cscientific philosophy\u201d, he is\nkeen to secure for philosophy a role that is independent of the\nspecial sciences. He finds the grounds for philosophy\u2019s\nindependence in its formal-teleological method, and in its concern\nwith a quaestio juris, rather than a quaestio facti.\nThat is, philosophy deals with questions of justification, it does not\ndetermine matters of fact.\n\nWindelband is well-known for having introduced a distinction between\nthe \u201cnomothetic method\u201d of the natural sciences and the\n\u201cidiographic method\u201d of the historical disciplines. His\nargument that history is a science [Wissenschaft] that\ncaptures the unique, unrepeatable and individual character of reality\nhas been highly relevant for subsequent debates on historical\nmethod.\n\nHe also made a name for himself in the history of philosophy by\npioneering the method of structuring the historical presentation in\nterms of fundamental philosophical problems, rather than as a\nchronology of individual thinkers.\n\nWindelband was a marvelous essayist. He developed his ideas not in the\nformat of a larger systematic work, but in a series of addresses and\nindividual papers, a selection of which was published in his famous\nPr\u00e4ludien [Preludes] in 1883. The genre of\nWindelband\u2019s writings does not lend itself to the development of\na philosophical system, and he often changes the emphasis, framing,\nand terminology of his claims and arguments from one essay to the\nnext. Nevertheless, he was a rigorous thinker. This entry provides a\nrational reconstruction of the systematic insights that Windelband\ndeveloped in his various addresses and essays, and groups them around\nthe central themes that reoccur throughout his oeuvre. With respect to\nmany of these themes\u2014the anti-psychologistic interpretation of\nKant, the fact-value distinction, the question of historical method,\nand the conception of the history of philosophy\u2014Windelband was a\nhighly influential contributor to the philosophical landscape of his\ntime. Although he did not develop a detailed and encompassing\nphilosophical system like his student Rickert, or the neo-Kantians of\nthe Marburg school, most notably Ernst Cassirer (1874\u20131945), his\nideas shaped subsequent debates on these issues more profoundly than\nis often acknowledged.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nWilhelm Windelband was born in 1848 in Potsdam, Germany. His father,\nJohann Friedrich Windelband was a state secretary for the Province of\nBrandenburg. Windelband studied in Jena, Berlin, and G\u00f6ttingen,\nattending lectures by Kuno Fischer (1824\u20131907) in Jena and\nstudying with Hermann Lotze (1817\u20131881) in G\u00f6ttingen.\nFischer and Lotze would deeply influence Windelband\u2019s\nphilosophical thinking, as well as his work as a historian of\nphilosophy.\n\nIn 1870, Windelband completed his dissertation on Die Lehren vom\nZufall [Doctrines of chance] under Lotze\u2019s\nsupervision. The following year he served as a soldier in the\nGerman-French war. After his military service, he completed his\nhabilitation in Leipzig and took up a position as\n\u201cPrivatdozent\u201d there. His habilitation was published in\n1873 under the title Ueber die Gewissheit der Erkenntniss: eine\npsychologisch-erkenntnisstheoretische Studie [On the\ncertainty of knowledge: a psychological-epistemological study].\nIn 1874, Windelband married Martha Wichgraf with whom he would have\nfour children.\n\nTwo years later, Windelband became professor (ordinarius) of\n\u201cinductive philosophy\u201d in Z\u00fcrich. He lectured on\npsychology before taking up a position as professor of philosophy in\nFreiburg im Breisgau in 1877. In 1882 he accepted an offer from the\nUniversity of Strasbourg. While his inaugural lectures in Z\u00fcrich\nand Freiburg had centered on the relation between psychology and\nphilosophy, his works from the Strasbourg period develop his core\nthemes in the philosophy of values and the philosophy of history.\nWindelband served as \u201cRektor\u201d of the University of\nStrasbourg in 1894/95 and 1897/98. He remained in Strasbourg until\n1903, when he accepted a call from the University of Heidelberg.\nBetween 1905 and 1908 he served as representative of the University of\nHeidelberg in the Baden \u201cLandtag\u201d. He was a member of the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences, and of the Academies of Sciences of\nG\u00f6ttingen, Bayern and Heidelberg. He remained in Heidelberg and\ntaught there until his death in 1915.\n2. From Kant to the Philosophy of Values\n\nWindelband\u2019s views on normativity are strongly influenced by his\nteacher Lotze. In his Logic (1874), Lotze distinguishes\nbetween psychological laws which determine how thinking proceeds as a\nmatter of fact, and logical laws, which are normative laws and\nprescribe how thinking ought to proceed (Lotze 1874: \u00a7x;\n\u00a7332, \u00a7337). This distinction also corresponds to a\ndistinction between act and content. Lotze observes that\n\u201cideas\u201d do occur in us as acts or events of the mind. But\ntheir content does not consist in such acts, is not reducible to\nmental activity, and does not exist in the way empirical processes and\nentities may be said to exist. It is not real, but \u201cvalid\u201d\n(Lotze 1874: \u00a7\u00a7314\u2013318).\n\nThe distinction between the factual and the normative would become the\ncornerstone of Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d.\nIn his early writings, however, Windelband does not yet embrace this\ndistinction. In his habilitation thesis \u00dcber die\nGewi\u00dfheit der Erkenntnis (1873), he argues that logic is a\nnormative discipline, but that it needs to be put on a psychological\nbasis. This is because the justification of our knowledge claims is\nalways dependent on and relative to specific epistemic purposes which,\nin turn, are given psychologically. Although he criticizes the\nidentification of the conditions of knowledge with psychophysical\nprocesses, he does think of psychology and logic or epistemology as\ncontinuous with one another. His 1875 \u201cDie Erkenntnislehre unter\ndem v\u00f6lkerpsychologischen Gesichtspunkte\u201d [\u201cThe\ntheory of knowledge from the perspective of folk-psychology\u201d]\nwhich was published in Moritz Lazarus\u2019 and Heyman\nSteinthal\u2019s Zeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und\nSprachwissenschaft [Journal of folk psychology and\nlinguistics], is more radical. It denies that logical norms are\nindependent of the conscious mind and claims that the origins of\nlogical norms are to be found in the social history of humankind: the\nprinciple of contradiction emerges in situations of social conflict\ntogether with the distinction between true and false beliefs; and the\nlaw of sufficient reason comes into being when conflicts between rival\nviews are no longer settled by brute force. On this picture, logical\nprinciples exist only when humans cognize them. There is no boundary\nbetween psychological acts and objective logical laws, or between\nactual historical acceptance and normative validity.\n\nThis is precisely the type of thinking that Windelband will later\nreject as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d, \u201chistoricist\u201d, and\n\u201crelativist\u201d (1883: 116\u2013117, 132). It is not clear\nwhat led Windelband to this change of view, but a deeper engagement\nwith the Critique of Pure Reason and with the Kant\nscholarship of his time, in particular with works by Kuno Fischer\n(1860), Herman Cohen (1871), and Friedrich Paulsen (1875), seem to\nhave factored in. The clear contours of Windelband\u2019s\nanti-psychologistic interpretation of Kant emerge for the first time\nin his 1877 paper \u201c\u00dcber die verschiedenen Phasen der\nKantischen Lehre vom Ding-an-sich\u201d [\u201cOn the different\nstages of the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself\u201d]. In this\nessay, Windelband argues against the idea, held by prominent figures\nof the \u201cback-to-Kant\u201d movement like Friedrich Albert Lange\n(1828\u20131875) and Hermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894), that\nknowledge emerges from an interaction between subject and object.\nAccording to their view, the object affects the subject\u2019s mind,\nwhile the subject provides the a priori cognitive structures\nthat organize representations. These a priori structures are\ninnate as they consist in the psychophysical constitution of the human\nsensory apparatus and mind. Cohen\u2019s critique of this\n(mis)interpretation focuses on the concept of the a priori\nand the question of objectivity (Cohen 1871). Windelband, in contrast,\ntakes the problem of the thing-in-itself and the concept of truth as\nhis starting points. His critique of the subject-object-interaction\nmodel leads him to an immanent conception of truth, according to which\ntruth consists in the normative rules according to which our judgments\nought to be formed. The immanent concept of truth thus shifts\nthe focus of philosophical analysis on the universal and necessary\n\u201crules\u201d that ground our judgments.\n\nThe 1877 essay gives a genetic account of the development of\nKant\u2019s views about the thing-in-itself from the Inaugural\nDissertation (1770) to the second edition of the Critique of\nPure Reason (1787). This genetic reconstruction is supposed to\nreveal the underlying philosophical problems and motivations that\ndrove Kant\u2019s thinking, as well as the inner tensions that,\naccording to Windelband, permeate critical philosophy. In particular,\nWindelband identifies a \u201cgulf\u201d (1877: 225) between\nKant\u2019s critique of knowledge and the metaphysics of morals, as\nwell as a tension between the psychological account of the faculties,\nand Kant\u2019s mature anti-psychologism. He distinguishes between\nfour phases in Kant\u2019s thinking about the thing-in-itself, and\nargues that residues of the latter three stages are present in both\neditions of the Critique (1781; 1787) and in the\nProlegomena (1783).\n\nThe first phase, Windelband argues, is that of the Inaugural\nDissertation (1770). Kant adopts Leibniz\u2019s distinction\nbetween noumena and phenomena while formulating a genuinely novel\nthought: he introduces the psychological distinction between receptive\nsensibility and the spontaneous intellect. This distinction allows him\nto maintain the claim that, unlike intuitions, concepts relate to\nthings-in-themselves (1877: 240\u2013241).\n\nIn the second phase, Kant concerns himself more deeply with the\nquestion how the concepts of the understanding can relate to objects.\nHe is driven to the insight that \n\n\n[w]e can only have a priori knowledge of that which we\nproduce by the lawlike forms of our rational activities\n[Vernunfthandlungen]. (1877: 246) \n\n\nHere, Windelband follows Fischer\u2019s claim that the categories of\nthe understanding are a priori valid for experience because\nthey produce or \u201cmake\u201d it (Fischer 1860). Because the\nunderstanding cannot \u201cmake\u201d the thing-in-itself, the\nthing-in-itself cannot be known.\n\nAccording to Windelband, Kant then proceeds to inquire why we are even\nassuming the existence of things-in-themselves if we cannot know them.\nHere he enters his third, most radical phase. Kant now thinks of the\nthing-in-itself as a fiction, an illegitimate hypostasis in which \n\n\nthe universal form of the synthetic act of the understanding is seen\nas something that exists independently of experience. (1877: 254) \n\n\nWindelband argues that it is only by dismissing the existence of the\nthing-in-itself and by jettisoning the phenomena-noumena distinction\nthat Kant can undertake his anti-psychologistic turn. With the\nrejection of the thing-in-itself, the characterization of sensibility\nas \u201creceptive\u201d also needs to be abandoned. And that makes\na psychological construal of the faculties nonsensical. Kant is then\nalso able to abandon the concept of truth as correspondence between\nrepresentations and objects in favor of a strictly immanent\nconception. The immanent conception defines truth in terms of the\nuniversal and necessary rules that the relations between our\nrepresentations need to accord to (1877: 259\u2013260).\n\nAnd yet, Kant could not rest with this radical view given his\ncommitments in moral philosophy. Practical reason, and in particular\nthe idea that the moral law does not depend on the qualities of humans\nas sensuous beings, but only on reason, demands a return to the\nassumption that the thing-in-itself exists (1877: 262). In the fourth\nphase, Kant thus reintroduces the thing-in-itself, while maintaining\nhis anti-psychologism.\n\nThis genetic reconstruction allows Windelband to think of the conflict\nbetween the different views of the thing-in-itself that had emerged\nwithin the neo-Kantian tradition as reflective of inherent tensions in\nthe Critique. He argues that Kant was especially unclear with\nrespect to psychologism: the distinction between judgment (as a\ncognitive process) and justification (as logical and normative) is\ninadequately articulated in the first Critique. Hence Kant is\nat least partly responsible for the fact that in the first wave of\nneo-Kantianism represented by Lange and Helmholtz \u201cthe new\nconcept of aprioricity was soon dragged down to the old idea of\npsychological priority\u201d (1883: 101).\n\nBut Windelband\u2019s approach to Kant is not merely historical. His\nsympathies clearly lie with the Kant of the third phase. For\nWindelband, the insight that natural psychological processes are\n\u201cutterly irrelevant\u201d for the truth value of our\nrepresentations (1882b: 24), and the idea that the ultimate problem of\nphilosophy is that of normativity and justification\u2014not a\nquaestio facti, but a quaestio juris (1882b:\n26)\u2014need to be defended from Kant\u2019s own unclarities on\nthese matters. Windelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d\ncan thus be understood as an attempt to purify, explicate and develop\nthe radical insights of the anti-psychologistic move in Kant\u2019s\n\u201cthird phase\u201d.\n\nThe cornerstone of this endeavor is the immanent conception of truth.\nWindelband repeatedly returns to discussing the correspondence theory\nof knowledge with its metaphor of a \u201cmirror relation\u201d\nbetween mind and object. He criticizes the misconception that our\nsensual perceptions are the things-in-themselves and that these things\ncould be compared with our representations. Any comparison must occur\nbetween representations, since things and representations are\n\u201cincommensurable\u201d (1881: 130). According to Windelband,\nKant\u2019s central innovation consists in the insight that the truth\nof our judgments, and the relation of our representations to an object\nare not to be found in correspondence at all. Rather, it consists in\nthe \u201crules\u201d for combining representations (1881: 134).\nThis leads Windelband to define truth as the \u201cnormality of\nthinking\u201d (1881: 138)\u2014with \u201cnormality\u201d meaning\nthat thinking proceeds in accordance with rules or norms. Windelband\nalso conceptualizes the object of knowledge in terms of the rules of\njudgment. The object of knowledge is nothing other than \n\n\na rule according to which representational elements ought to organize\nthemselves, in order for them to be recognized as universally valid in\nthis organization. (1881: 135).\n\n\nWindelband uses the terms \u201caxioms\u201d and\n\u201cvalues\u201d interchangeably to refer to the most fundamental\nrules, and he uses the term \u201cnorms\u201d often, but not fully\nconsistently to refer to values or axioms as they relate to\npsychological experience and the cultural-historical world. Focusing\nhis interpretation on \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201cnorms\u201d,\nWindelband captures the structural similarity of Kant\u2019s three\nCritiques in terms of immanent truth: if truth is nothing\nother than accordance with a rule, then there is moral and aesthetic\ntruth in just the same way as there is epistemic truth (1881: 140). In\na later text, Windelband describes the unified project of the three\nCritiques in terms of the necessary and universal relation\nbetween thought and object. He writes that the postulates of practical\nreason relate to intelligible objects (ideas) just \u201cas\nnecessarily\u201d as the intuitions and categories relate to the\nobject of experience, and that teleological judgment constructs the\npurposive whole of nature just \u201cas universally\u201d as the\nprinciples of pure understanding apply the categories to experience\n(1904a: 151). While this formulation glosses over some of the nuances\nof the distinction between constitutive and regulative uses of reason,\nWindelband\u2019s main intention is not that of giving a detailed and\nfully accurate reconstruction of Kant\u2019s philosophy. In line with\nhis famous dictum that \u201cunderstanding Kant means to go beyond\nhim\u201d (1915: iv), he instead seeks to revive the critical project\nin a manner that allows it to answer the needs of his own time. And\nWindelband thinks that the critical philosophy required at the time of\nhis writing is a \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d which reveals the\nmost fundamental values in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.\n3. The Factual, the Normative, and the Method of Philosophy\n\nAs indicated above, Windelband bases his \u201cphilosophy of\nvalues\u201d on Lotze\u2019s distinction between the factual and the\nnormative. Throughout his career, he seeks to explicate and clarify\nthis distinction and to illuminate its consequences for philosophical\nmethod. \n\nIn \u201cWas ist Philosophie?\u201d [\u201cWhat is\nphilosophy?\u201d] (1882), Windelband approaches the factual-normative\ndistinction by identifying two basic and irreducible types of\ncognitive operations: judgments and evaluations. While judgments\nrelate representations in a synthesis, and thus expand our knowledge\nabout an object, evaluations presuppose an object as given. They do\nnot expand our knowledge. Rather, they express a relation between the\n\u201cevaluating consciousness\u201d and the represented object in a\n\u201cfeeling\u201d of approval or disapproval (1882b:\n29\u201330).\n\nDespite characterizing evaluations in terms of the feelings and\nsubjective attitudes of the evaluating consciousness, Windelband\nargues that some evaluations are \u201cabsolutely valid\u201d. Even\nif they are not embraced by everyone as a matter fact, they entail a\nnormative demand: they ought to be accepted universally\naccording to an absolute value (1882b: 37). The basic idea seems to be\nthat the normative force of any particular evaluation that is carried\nout by an empirical consciousness is derived from its relation to a\nnon-empirical, absolute value. Windelband argues that even if there is\ndisagreement about which evaluations ought to be embraced as universal\nand necessary, the demand for absolute validity itself can be\nrecognized by everyone: we all believe in the distinction between that\nwhich is absolutely valid and that which is not (1882b: 43).\n\nAccordingly, there must be a system of absolute values from which the\nvalidity of judgments in epistemology, aesthetics, and ethic derives.\nCritical philosophy, then, is nothing other than the \u201cscience of\nnecessary and universal values\u201d (1882b: 26) that explicates this\nsystem and thus reveals the grounds of normative appraisal and valid\njudgment. Note that for Windelband, normativity and validity are\nclosely linked, if not identical. Absolute values endow our judgments\nwith a normative demand. Our judgments are valid if and only if they\nraise a normative demand, that is if they ought to be\naccepted universally and necessarily.\n\nHaving distinguished the factual and the normative by reference to\ndifferent cognitive operations, Windelband also seeks to identify the\npoints of contact between the two realms. Ultimately, he wants to\nexplain how empirical beings can recognize absolute values. His idea\nthat there is a system of absolute values is thus accompanied by the\nconception of a \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. In normal\nconsciousness the absolute system of values is, at least partially,\nrepresented in the form of norms that are known by \u201cempirical\nconsciousness\u201d and that have an effect on it.\n\nStarting from the immanent conception of truth as accordance with a\nrule, Windelband distinguishes from among the infinite possible\ncombinations of representations that might or might not be formed by\nempirical consciousness a subset of combinations: the subset that\naccords with universal and necessary rules, and which hence ought to\nbe formed (1881: 135\u2013139: 1882a: 72\u201373). This subset is\nwhat he calls \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d (1881: 139). Thought\nis related to and valid for an object if of the infinite possible\ncombinations of our representations, our thinking forms exactly those\njudgments that \u201cought to be thought\u201d (1881: 135). One\nmight say that empirical consciousness contains (parts) of the system\nof absolute values as its \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. To the\nextent that philosophy seeks not only to reveal the absolute system of\nvalues, but also to inquire into how they can be norms for\nempirical\u2014embodied, psychological and historically\nsituated\u2014human beings, critical philosophy is not only a\n\u201cscience of values\u201d, but also a \u201cscience of normal\nconsciousness\u201d (1882b: 46).\n\nAlthough Windelband refers to the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d\nas a science, he emphasizes that philosophy does not rely on the\nmethods of the empirical sciences. Philosophy is a second-order\nscience that reflects on the methods and results of the various\nempirical disciplines in order to reveal the values \u201cby virtue\nof which we can evaluate the form and extent of their validity\u201d\n(1907: 9). Crucially, this reflective endeavor cannot be carried out\nby means of empirical investigation. Here, the distinction between the\nfactual and the normative assumes a methodological dimension.\n\nIn \u201cKritische oder genetische Methode?\u201d [\u201cCritical or\ngenetic method?\u201d] (1883) Windelband lays out in great detail the\ndifferences between the \u201cexplanatory\u201d and\n\u201cgenetic\u201d method of the empirical sciences, on the one\nhand, and the \u201cteleological\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nmethod of philosophy, on the other. And he warns of the devastating\nconsequences that result if the two are conflated. He singles out two\ndisciplines that might be thought to be relevant to philosophical\nquestions about values: individual psychology and cultural history. He\ndoes not call into question the legitimacy of these disciplines or of\nthe \u201cgenetic method\u201d in general. He even thinks that the\ngenetic method can be applied to values. That is, individual\npsychology and cultural history can yield valid genetic theories that\nexplain the actual acceptance and development of values in an\nindividual\u2019s mental life and in cultural history. But actual\nacceptance is not the same as normative validity, and validity proper\ncannot be found by generalizing from the empirical. A firm boundary\nseparates the genetic method and its approach toward actually accepted\nvalues from the critical method of philosophy which concerns values as\nnormative.\n\nWindelband\u2019s argument against the application of the genetic\nmethod to philosophical questions has three components. First, he\nargues that the genetic method cannot solve philosophical questions\nabout normativity and validity, because there is too much variety\nregarding the values that have been and are actually accepted. The\nempirical method will not uncover values that are universally embraced\nby all cultures (1883: 114\u2013115).\n\nSecond, the genetic method can show and explain why some values have\nbeen accepted by this or that individual, or in this or that culture.\nBut insofar as it is an empirical method, it cannot establish that the\nvalues in question are universal and necessary. \n\n\nThe universally valid can be found neither by inductive comparison of\nall individuals and peoples nor by deductive inference from \u2026\nthe \u2018essence\u2019 of man. (1883: 115) \n\n\nWindelband points to the absurdity of trying to justify by empirical\nmeans that which is the presupposition of any empirical theory: the\naxioms upon which the validity of any theory is based (1883: 113).\n\nThird, Windelband argues that the genetic method leads to relativism.\nThe argument rests on the two claims just outlined, and can be\nreconstructed as follows. There is variation between individuals and\ncultures regarding which beliefs are actually prevalent, and the\nnaturally necessary [naturnotwendig] laws of psychology lead\nto the formation of both true and false beliefs. As an empirical\nmethod with no access to the universal and necessary, the genetic\nmethod of cultural history and individual psychology has no criterion\nfor distinguishing between valid and invalid beliefs. This means that\nit has to treat all beliefs as \u201cequally justified [alle\ngleich berechtigt]\u201d (1882b: 36).\n\n\nFor [the genetic explanation], there is thus no absolute measure; it\nmust treat all beliefs as equally justified because they are all\nequally necessary by nature\u2026 [R]elativism is the necessary\nconsequence of the purely empiricist treatment of philosophy\u2019s\ncardinal question. (1883: 115\u2013116)\n\n\nNote that Windelband does not differentiate between the idea that all\nbeliefs have only relative validity and the claim that they are all\nequally justified or equally valid. In his view, the genetic method\ndoes not merely render belief relative to individuals and cultures; it\nalso forces us to conclude that all beliefs are equally valid. An\nempirical psychology or cultural history that oversteps its boundaries\nand tries to address philosophical questions about normativity and\nvalidity leads to \u201chistoricism\u201d,\n\u201cpsychologism\u201d, and \u201crelativism\u201d and destroys\nthe basis of normative appraisal altogether.\n\nHaving rejected the genetic method in philosophy, Windelband explains\nthat philosophical method is purely \u201cformal\u201d. The axioms,\nor values, on which the validity of our judgments is based upon cannot\nbe proven. But it can be shown that the purposes of recognizing truth,\nbeauty, and can only be achieved if absolute values are presupposed.\nHence the critical method of philosophy has a teleological\nstructure:\n\n\n[F]or the critical method these axioms, regardless of the extent to\nwhich they are actually accepted, are norms which ought to be valid if\nthinking wants to fulfil the purpose of being true, volition the\npurpose of being good, and feeling the purpose of capturing beauty, in\na manner that warrants universal validation. (1883: 109)\n\n\nAnd yet, while Windelband insists on the distinction between the\nempirical-genetic method of science and the critical-teleological\nmethod of philosophy, he takes his theory of \u201cnormal\nconsciousness\u201d to imply that empirical facts do play a role in\nphilosophy. In particular, he wants to maintain that empirical facts\nabout individual psychology and culture can provide the starting\npoints for philosophical reflection. He therefore describes the\nphilosophical method as a method of reflection\n[Selbstbesinnung], in which the empirical mind becomes aware\nof its own \u201cnormal consciousness\u201d. Philosophy examines\nexisting claims to validity in light of teleological considerations,\nand in this way reveals the \u201cprocessual forms of psychic life\nthat are necessary conditions for the realization of universal\nappraisal\u201d (1883: 125). Put differently, teleological\nconsiderations allow the empirical consciousness to distinguish within\nitself between empirical and contingent contents, on the one hand, and\nthe \u201ccontents and forms\u201d that \u201chave the value of\nnormal consciousness\u201d, on the other (1882b: 45\u201346; 1881:\n139).\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question\nhow the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s\nreflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career,\nWindelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies\nfor reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His\ndissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts\nof chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband\nstill embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom,\naccording to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all\nintentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay,\nwhich had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the\nthing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the\nradical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d,\nKant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to\nconvince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an\nalternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his\n1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and\nnatural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber\nWillenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts,\nWindelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian\ndualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we\nneed to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not\npresuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative\nevaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of\nviewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object\nof moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a\ntranscendentally free will, but a\n\u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively\nstable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the\nnatural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core\nthoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and\nin the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict\nbetween natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action\nthat would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous.\nBut if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes,\nit is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a:\n59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and\nthat for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental\ncapacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of\npsychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go.\nHowever, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways\nof viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological\nscience which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other\nhand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are,\nbut express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to\nthe antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the\nrelation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ\nfrom causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact,\nact on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of\n\u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system\nof absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues\nthat a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal\nconsciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in\nagreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself: \n\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking\nor willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate\nevidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the\nawareness of the norm. (1882a: 85) \n\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical\nconsciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and\ndetermines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see\nalso 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of\nfreedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in\nnothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we\nought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with\nnatural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical\nconsciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can\nbe aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904\nlectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines\nour moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we\nact in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d.\nWindelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative,\nquestion and concludes that we may well call those decisions and\nactions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our\nconstant personality, as opposed to being determined by external\ncircumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered\ncausality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our\nconcept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a\nnormative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges\nthe attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is\npossible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the\ncapacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the\nsame circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding\nhuman freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s\ndistinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused\ncause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as\nconstructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that\nearlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses\ntwo problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual\nhas developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the\nmetaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the\nindividual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is\nan abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot\naccount for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b:\n161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the\n\u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d\n(1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to\nunderstand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless\ncausality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal\nselves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the\nlatter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of\nearlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the\nconcept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his\nalternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of\nfreedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view\nthat the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative\ndiscourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are\nperfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of\nfreedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we\ndisregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction\nbetween the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and\nideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the\nworld of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according\nto causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative\nevaluations. Evaluation \n\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only\nwhich can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the\nmanner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of\nthe factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another\nform of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136) \n\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When\nspeaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense\nthat we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic\nprocesses (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As\ndescribed above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result\nthat that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement\nwith a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the\nconstant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions\nnecessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical\nstandpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral\nappraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in\ndoing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal\nprocess over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the\nupshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility\ndoes not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom,\nbecause it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely\npresupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act\notherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers \n\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but\nto the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n5. The Natural and the Historical Sciences\n\nIn Windelband\u2019s view, a reconsideration of the Kantian project\nis not only necessary because of its inherent tensions; broader\ndevelopments in nineteenth-century culture and science also\nnecessitate an adaptation of the critical method to changed historical\ncircumstances. One important factor is the professionalization of the\nhistorical disciplines that had been underway since the early\nnineteenth century (1907: 12). One of Windelband\u2019s central and\nbest known philosophical contributions concerns the question what\ndistinguishes the \u201chistorical sciences\u201d, that is, those\ndisciplines that study the human-historical and cultural world, from\nthe natural sciences. Windelband\u2019s answer to this question is in\nline with his formal-teleological conception of philosophy: by\nexplicating the autonomous presuppositions of historical method,\ncritical philosophy safeguards the historical sciences against\nmethodological holism, namely the view that there is only one\nscientific method, and that this is the method of physics and natural\nscience.\n\nWindelband shares the goal of securing the autonomy of the historical\ndisciplines with his contemporary Wilhelm Dilthey. In his 1883\nEinleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften [Introduction to\nthe human sciences] Dilthey had founded the distinction between\nthe natural sciences and the human sciences or \u201csciences of\nspirit\u201d on a distinction between outer and inner experience.\nWhile outer experience forms the basis of hypothetical knowledge in\nnatural science, inner experience discloses \u201cfrom within\u201d\nhow the individual is an intersection of social and cultural relations\n(Dilthey 1883: 30\u201332, 60\u201361, 88\u201389). Inner\nexperience is at the same time psychological and socio-historical, and\na descriptive psychology capable of grasping the integrated nexus of\ninner experience can provide the \u201csciences of spirit\u201d with\na solid foundation (Dilthey 1894).\n\nWindelband profoundly disagrees with Dilthey\u2019s strategy for\ndemarcating the historical disciplines. In his Strasbourg\nrector\u2019s address \u201cGeschichte und Naturwissenschaft\u201d\n[\u201cHistory and natural science\u201d] from 1894, he takes issue\nwith the suggestion that the facts of the \u201csciences of\nspirit\u201d derive from a particular type of experience. He takes\nDilthey to endorse an introspective view of psychological method. To\nthis he objects that the facts of the historical disciplines do not\nderive from inner experience alone, and that inner perception is a\ndubious method in the first place. He also classifies psychology with\nthe natural sciences, rejecting Dilthey\u2019s idea that the\nhuman-historical disciplines could be founded on a non-explanatory and\nnon-hypothetical descriptive psychology. Perhaps most fundamentally,\nWindelband rejects the term \u201csciences of spirit\u201d on the\nground that it suggests that the distinction between different\nsciences rests on a material distinction between different objects:\nspirit and nature (Windelband 1894: 141\u2013143).\n\nWindelband seeks an alternative method for science-classification that\nis purely formal. His reflections take scientific justification in its\nmost abstract form as their starting point: justification in science\nis either inductive or deductive, Windelband argues, and the basic\nrelation on which all knowledge is based is between the general and\nthe particular (1883: 102\u2013103).\n\nThe distinction between different empirical sciences is then also to\nbe sought at this level. In particular, Windelband argues that science\nmight pursue one of two different \u201cknowledge goals\u201d (1894:\n143): it \u201ceither seeks the general in the form of natural law or\nthe particular in the historically determined form\u201d (1894: 145).\nThe former approach is that of the \u201cnomothetic sciences\u201d\nwhich seek to arrive at universal apodictic judgments, treating the\nparticular and unique as a mere exemplar or special case of the type\nor of the generic concept. The \u201cidiographic sciences\u201d, in\ncontrast, aim to arrive at singular assertoric judgments that\nrepresent a unique object in its individual formation (1894: 150).\n\nWindelband emphasizes that the distinction between nomothetic and\nidiographic sciences is a purely formal and teleological one. One and\nthe same object can be approached from both points of view, and which\nmethod is appropriate depends entirely on the goal or purpose of the\ninvestigation. Moreover, most sciences will involve both general and\nparticular knowledge. The idiographic sciences in particular depend on\ngeneral and causal knowledge which has been derived from the\nnomothetic sciences (1894: 156\u2013157).\n\nNote, however, that Windelband is not consistently restricting his\nanalysis to the formal level. He tends to use the terms\n\u201cnomothetic\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d sciences, and the\nterms \u201cidiographic\u201d and \u201chistorical\u201d sciences\ninterchangeably, which at least suggests a correspondence between\nscientific goals, methods, and objects.\n\nAlthough Windelband does not spell this out in great detail, he also\nsuggests that values are of integral importance to the idiographic\nmethod. First, he argues that the selection of relevant historical\nfacts depends on an assessment of what is valuable to us (1894:\n153\u2013154). Second, he suggests that the integration of particular\nfacts into larger wholes is only possible if meaningful, value-laden\nrelations can be established such that \u201cthe particular feature\nis a meaningful part of a living intuition of the whole\n[Gesamtanschauung]\u201d (1894: 154). And third, he claims\nthat we value the particular, unique, and individual in a way in which\nwe do not value the general and recurrent, and that the experience of\nthe individual is indeed at the root of our \u201cfeelings of\nvalue\u201d (1894: 155\u2013156).\n\nIt is Windelband\u2019s student Heinrich Rickert who takes up these\nsuggestions and develops them into a systematic account of the\n\u201cindividuating\u201d and \u201cvalue-relating\u201d\n\u201cconcept-formation\u201d of the \u201chistorical sciences of\nculture\u201d (Rickert 1902). Rickert argues that \u201cscientific\nconcept formation\u201d, by which science overcomes the\n\u201cextensive and intensive manifold\u201d of reality, depends on\na principle of selection. The principle of selection at work in the\nnatural sciences is that of \u201cgeneralization\u201d. For this\nreason, the natural sciences cannot account for the unique and\nunrepeatable character of reality. The historical sciences, in\ncontrast, form their concepts in a manner that allows them to capture\nindividual realities (Rickert 1902: 225, 236, 250\u2013251). They do\nso on the basis of values: values guide the selection of which\nparticular historical facts belong to and can be integrated into a\nspecific historical \u201cindividuality\u201d (examples being\n\u201cthe Renaissance\u201d, \u201cthe Reformation\u201d or\n\u201cthe German nation state\u201d). According to Rickert, one can\nclearly distinguish the theoretical value-relation that is the basis\nof historical science and practical evaluation. The historian relies\non values but does not evaluate his material (Rickert 1902:\n364\u2013365). Building on Windelband\u2019s core ideas about\nhistorical method, Rickert arrives at a more refined and systematized\naccount of how historical science forms its concepts, that ultimately\nleads to an account of what culture as an object of scientific study\namounts to.\n\nIn some of his later writings, Windelband will pick up the more\ndeveloped thoughts of his student Rickert. For example, he claims that\neach science creates its objects according to the manner in which it\nforms its concepts (1907: 18), and that the historical sciences rely\non a system of universal values when making selections about what\nenters into their concepts (1907: 20).\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of\nwritings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers\nmodern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also\npublished on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily\nindebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his\nteacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation.\nWindelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory\nof problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of\ngreat minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas\naccording to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical\ndebates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes\na reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and\nseeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of\nphilosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts:\nFirst, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age\nand, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has\nsystematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in\nHegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring\nHegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time\napprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the\n\u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909:\n4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the\nhistory of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance\nfor systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as\nthe \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the\nabsolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is\ncritical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different\nunderstanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time\napprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that\nphilosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent\nfactors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian\nconception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with\nthe idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge\nis necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has\nsystematic significance: \n\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with\nrespect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of\ndevelopment cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see\nalso 1905: 176\u2013177) \n\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary\nself-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of\ncultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking\nlead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which\nvarious, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one\nanother. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual\nfactor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is\nrelevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated\nin a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of\nphilosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement,\nhe does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband\nprobes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about\nprogress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876)\nWindelband argues that science cannot decide between historical\noptimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und\ngenetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of\nwhy this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he\nobserves. In order to determine whether a given historical development\nis progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the\nidea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d\n(1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that\nidentify the historical development of present-day values with\nprogress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and\ncould have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we\nonly take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in\nthem\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately,\nif we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess\nthe historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to\na progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the\nsystematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress\ncannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by\ncontingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also\nopens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d\nof philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie\n[Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on\nthe fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain\ngeneral concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content\nof philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy\nonly takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that\nare baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of\nshock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and\ncritically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science.\nIn this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify\nthese concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified\nsystem. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual\nreorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The\n\u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of\nour spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems\n\u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what\n\u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely\nthey spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes\nthree claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even\nwhen reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by\ncontingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from\nthe \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the\ncontents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10).\nThat is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing\ndrive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life.\nSecond, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual\n\u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe\nobjective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational\ndeliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of\nphilosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical\nchange \n\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and\nover again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual\ndialectics. (1914: 10) \n\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and\n\u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history.\nPhilosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891:\n9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued\nempirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the\n\u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that\ntogether give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems. \n\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of\nconstructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of\n\u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other\nhand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905:\n189) \n\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and\nsystematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in\ndisentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that\nwhich is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the\n\u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent\nthat it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of\ncultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n7. Critical Philosophy and World-Views\n\nWindelband\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d is also an\nintervention into debates that had preoccupied the neo-Kantian\nmovement and German academic philosophy more broadly since the\nmaterialism controversy [Materialismusstreit]: what the\nrelation between science and world-views is, and whether philosophy is\ncapable of providing a \u201cworld-view\u201d.\n\nGiven that he takes the core of the critical project to consist in a\nquaestio juris\u2014a concern with normativity\u2014it\nseems surprising that throughout the 1880s Windelband insists that\ncritical philosophy does not provide a \u201cworld-view\u201d: the\nproject of revealing the highest values of human life has nothing to\ndo with \u201cworld-views\u201d, he argues, because it does not\nprovide a metaphysical account of the world and our place in it (1881:\n140\u2013141, 145). Questions about optimism or pessimism cannot be\nanswered by means of \u201cscientific\u201d philosophy, since they\ndepend on the idea that the world as a whole has a purpose. And claims\nabout the ultimate purpose of the world arise only from an\nunscientific, subjective, and arbitrary projection of particular\npurposes onto the universe as such (1876: 231). Philosophy is a\nscience, albeit a second-order formal science, and is thus barred from\nformulating a world-view that would be metaphysical in character.\n\nAfter 1900, however, Windelband\u2019s position on the question of\nworld-views changes. He now claims that it is the aim of philosophy to\nprovide a \u201cworld-view\u201d with scientific justification\n(1907: 1). Given that Windelband holds that philosophy in general and\nthe Kantian project in particular need to be adapted to the developing\ncircumstances of time and culture, this change of position is not\ninconsequential: the cultural landscape of the early 1900s demands a\nrevision of the neo-Kantian project that highlights not only its\n\u201cnegative\u201d and critical aspects, but also develops its\npositive implications for cultural life (1907, 8). The shift to a more\npositive attitude towards philosophy as a world-view corresponds to a\nre-evaluation of Kant\u2019s oeuvre, in which Windelband at least\npartly suspends the anti-metaphysical rigor of the \u201cthird\nphase\u201d of the genesis of the Critique of Pure Reason,\nand attributes more relevance to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment. This view is taken up by Rickert, who later argues in\nmore detail that the third Critique forms\nthe core of critical philosophy, and that Kant\u2019s metaphysical\nproject can provide the basis for an encompassing theory of\nworld-views (Rickert 1924: 153\u2013168).\n\nIn his 1904 \u201cNach hundert Jahren\u201d [\u201cAfter one\nhundred years\u201d] Windelband provides yet another take on the\nrelation between the natural and the normative. Declaring the question\nhow the realm of natural laws is related to the realm of values to be\nthe \u201chighest\u201d philosophical endeavor (1904a: 162), he now\nsees in the Critique of the Power of Judgment the possibility\nof solving this problem: here one finds the idea that the purposive\nsystem of nature gives rise to the value-determined process of human\nhistory. The central concept that allows for connecting nature and\nhistory in this way is that of \u201crealization\u201d (1904a:\n162\u20133).\n\nThe turn to the concept of \u201crealization\u201d also leads to a\nshift in how Windelband approaches the problem of science\nclassification. In 1894, Windelband had thought of the nomothetic and\nidiographic sciences as two fundamental yet disjointed and even\nincommensurable approaches to seeking knowledge of the word:\n\u201cLaw and event persist next to each other as the last,\nincommensurable factors of our representation of the world\u201d\n(1894: 160). But in 1904, he claims that the concept of realization\nprovides a common, unified basis for the natural and the historical\nsciences (1904a: 163).\n\nWindelband\u2019s language assumes a Hegelian tone. Critical\nphilosophy equipped with the concept of realization is able to grasp\nand express the \u201cspiritual value content\u201d of reality\n(1904a: 165). History is capable of revealing the universal value\ncontent in the contingent maze of human interests and desires, and in\nso doing captures \u201cthe progressive realization of rational\nvalues\u201d (1907: 20\u201321). The human as a rational being is\nnot determined psychologically or naturally, but humanity is a\nhistorical task: \u201conly as a historical being, as the developing\nspecies, do we have a share in world-reason\u201d (1910a: 283: see\nalso 1905: 185). Windelband even suggests that history itself has a\ngoal, namely the realization of a common humanity (1908: 257).\n\nThese remarks remain cursory however, and there is room for debate\nover how much of Hegel\u2019s ontology of history Windelband takes on\nboard, as well as whether his talk about the progressive realization\nof reason in history is incompatible with the formal-teleological\nmethod that he had endorsed in the 1880s and 1890s. His\n\u201cKulturphilosophie und transzendentaler Idealismus\u201d\n[\u201cPhilosophy of culture and transcendental idealism\u201d] of\n1910 presents us with a puzzling fusion of Kantian and Hegelian\nlanguage. The goal of critical philosophy is that of revealing the\nunity of culture, Windelband now claims, and this unity can only be\nfound \n\n\nby grasping the essence of the function \u2026 which is common for\nall the particular \u2026cultural activities: and this can be\nnothing else than the self-consciousness of reason which produces its\nobjects and in them the realm of validity itself. (1910b: 293).\n\n",
