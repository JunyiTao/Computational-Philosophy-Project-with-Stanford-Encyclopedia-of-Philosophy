    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || Causal Discovery with Interventions\n4.9 Causal Discovery with Interventions\n\nIn the previous section, we discussed how to use knowledge (or\nassumptions) about the structure of a causal graph \\(\\bG\\) to make\ninferences about the results of interventions. In this section, we\nexplore the converse problem. If we can intervene on variables and\nobserve the post-intervention probability distribution, what can we\ninfer about the underlying causal structure? This topic has been\nexplored extensively in the work of Eberhardt and his collaborators.\n(See, for example, Eberhardt & Scheines 2007 and Hyttinen et al.\n2013a.) Unsurprisingly, we can learn more about causal structure if we\ncan perform interventions than if we can only make passive\nobservations. However, just how much we can infer depends upon what\nkinds of interventions we can perform, and on what background\nassumptions we make.\n\nIf there are no latent common causes, so that the true causal\nstructure on \\(\\bV\\)\nis represented by a DAG \\(\\bG\\), then it will always be possible to discover\nthe complete causal structure using interventions. If we can only\nintervene on one variable at a time, we may need to separately\nintervene on all but one of the variables before the causal structure\nis uniquely identified. If we can intervene on multiple variables at\nthe same time, we can discover the true causal structure more\nquickly.\n\nIf there are latent common causes, so that the true causal structure\non \\(\\bV\\) is represented by an ADMG, then it may not be possible to\ndiscover the true causal structure using only single-variable\ninterventions.  (Although we can do this in the special case where the\nfunctions in the underlying structural equation model are all linear.)\nHowever, if we can intervene on multiple variables at the same time,\nthen it is possible to discover the true causal graph.\n\nEberhardt and collaborators have also explored causal discovery using\nsoft interventions. A soft intervention influences the value\nof a variable without breaking the arrows into that variable. For\ninstance, suppose we want to know whether increasing the income of\nparolees will lead to decreased recidivism. We randomly divide\nsubjects into treatment and control conditions, and give regular cash\npayments to those in the treatment condition. This is not an\nintervention on income per se, since income will still be\ninfluenced by usual factors: savings and investments, job training,\nhelp from family members, and so on. Soft interventions facilitate\ncausal inference because they create colliders, and as we have seen,\ncolliders have a distinct probabilistic signature. Counterintuitively,\nthis means that if we want to determine whether X causes\nY it is desirable to perform a soft intervention on Y\n(rather than X), to see if we can create a collider\n\\(I\\rightarrow Y\\leftarrow X\\) (where I is the intervention).\nSoft interventions are closely related to instrumental\nvariables. If there are no latent common causes, we can infer the\ntrue causal structure using soft interventions. Indeed, if we can\nintervene on every variable at once, we can determine the correct\ncausal structure from this one intervention. However, if there are\nlatent common causes, it is not in general possible to discover the\ncomplete causal structure using soft interventions. (Although this can\nbe done if we assume linearity.)\n4.10 Counterfactuals\n\nSection 3.3\n above discussed counterfactuals in the context of deterministic\ncausal models. The introduction of probability adds a number of\ncomplications. In particular, we can now talk meaningfully about the\nprobability of a counterfactual being true. Counterfactuals play a\ncentral role in the potential outcome framework for causal\nmodels pioneered by Neyman (1923), and developed by Rubin (1974) and\nRobins (1986), among others.\n\nCounterfactuals in the potential outcome framework interact with\nprobability differently than counterfactuals in Lewis\u2019s (1973b)\nframework. Suppose that Ted was exposed to asbestos and developed lung\ncancer. We are interested in the counterfactual: \u201cIf Ted had not\nbeen exposed to asbestos, he would not have developed lung\ncancer\u201d. Suppose that the processes by which cancer develops are\ngenuinely indeterministic. Then, it seems wrong to say that if Ted had\nnot been exposed to asbestos, he definitely would have developed lung\ncancer; and it seems equally wrong to say that he definitely would not\nhave developed lung cancer. In this case, Lewis would say that the\ncounterfactual \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, he\nwould not have developed lung cancer\u201d is determinately\nfalse. As a result, the objective probability of this\ncounterfactual being true is zero. On the other hand, a counterfactual\nwith objective probability in the consequent may be true:\n\u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, his objective chance\nof developing lung cancer would have been .06\u201d. By contrast, in\nthe potential outcome framework, probability may be pulled out of the\nconsequent and applied to the counterfactual as a whole: The\nprobability of the counterfactual \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed\nto asbestos, he would have developed lung cancer\u201d can be\n.06.\n\nIf we have a complete structural equation model, we can assign\nprobabilities to counterfactuals, in light of observations. Let \\(\\bV\n= \\{X_1, X_2 ,\\ldots ,X_n\\}\\) be a set of endogenous variables, and\n\\(\\bU = \\{U_1, U_2 ,\\ldots ,U_n\\}\\) a set of exogenous variables. Our\nstructural equations have the form: \n\n\\[X_i = f_i (\\bPA(X_i), U_i)\\]\n\n\nWe have a probability distribution \\(\\Pr'\\) on \\(\\bU\\), which induces\na probability distribution P on \\(\\bU \\cup \\bV\\). Suppose that we\nobserve the value of some of the variables: \\(X_j = x_j\\) for all \\(j\n\\in \\bS \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots ,n\\}\\). We now want to assess the\ncounterfactual \u201cif \\(X_k\\) had been \\(x_k\\), then \\(X_l\\) would\nhave been \\(x_l\\)\u201d, where k and l may be in\n\\(\\bS\\) but need not be. We can evaluate the probability of this\ncounterfactual using this three-step process:\n\nUpdate the probability P by conditioning on the observations, to\nget a new probability distribution \\(\\Pr(\u2022 \\mid \\cap_{j \\in \\bS}\nX_j = x_j)\\). Call the restriction of this probability function to\n\\(\\bU\\) \\(\\Pr''\\).\nReplace the equation for \\(X_k\\) with \\(X_k = x_k\\).\nUse the distribution \\(\\Pr''\\) on \\(\\bU\\) together with the\nmodified set of equations to induce a new probability distribution P*\non \\(\\bV\\). \\(\\Pr^*( X_l = x_l)\\) is then the probability of the\ncounterfactual.\n\n\nThis procedure differs from the procedure for interventions (discussed\nin\n Section 4.7)\n in that steps 1 and 2 have been reversed. We first update the\nprobability distribution, then perform the intervention. This reflects\nthe fact that the observations tell us about the actual world, in\nwhich the intervention did not (necessarily) occur.\n\nIf we do not have a complete SEM, it is not generally possible to\nidentify the probability of a counterfactual, but only to set upper\nand lower bounds. For example, suppose that we believe that asbestos\nexposure causes lung cancer, so that we posit a simple DAG:\n\n\\[A \\rightarrow L.\\]\n\n\nSuppose also that we have data for people similar to Ted which yields\nthe following probabilities: \n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid A = 1) & = .11,\\\\\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid A = 0) & = .06.\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\n(We are oversimplifying, and treating asbestos and lung cancer as\nbinary variables.) We observe that Ted was in fact exposed to asbestos\nand did in fact develop lung cancer. What is the probability of the\ncounterfactual: \u201cIf Ted had not been exposed to asbestos, he\nwould not have developed lung cancer\u201d? Pearl (2009) calls a\nprobability of this form a probability of necessity. It is\noften called the probability of causation, although this\nterminology is misleading for reasons discussed by Greenland and\nRobins (1988). This quantity is often of interest in tort law. Suppose\nthat Ted sues his employer for damages related to his lung cancer. He\nwould have to persuade a jury that his exposure to asbestos caused his\nlung cancer. American civil law requires a \u201cmore probable than\nnot\u201d standard of proof, and it employs a \u201cbut for\u201d\nor counterfactual definition of causation. Hence Ted must convince the\njury that it is more probable than not that he would not have\ndeveloped lung cancer if he had not been exposed.\n\nWe may divide the members of the population into four categories,\ndepending upon which counterfactuals are true of them:\n\ndoomed individuals will develop lung cancer no matter\nwhat\nimmune individuals will avoid lung cancer no matter\nwhat\nsensitive individuals will develop lung cancer just in\ncase they are exposed to asbestos\nreverse sensitive individuals will develop lung cancer\njust in case they are not exposed to asbestos\n\n\nIt is easiest to think of the population as being divided into four\ncategories, with each person being one of these four types. However,\nwe do not need to assume that the process is deterministic; it may be\nthe case that each person only has a certain probability of falling\ninto one of these categories.\n\nMathematically, this is equivalent to the following. Let \\(U_L\\) be\nthe error variable for \\(L. U_L\\) takes values of the form \\((u_1,\nu_2)\\) with each \\(u_i\\) being 0 or 1. \\((1, 1)\\) corresponds to\ndoomed, \\((0, 0)\\) to immune, \\((1, 0)\\) to\nsensitive, and \\((0, 1)\\) to reverse. That is, the\nfirst element tells us what value L will take if an individual\nis exposed to asbestos, and the second element what value L\nwill take if an individual is not exposed. The equation for L\nwill be \\(L = (A \\times u_1) + ((1 - A) \\times u_2)\\).\n\nLet us assume that the distribution of the error variable \\(U_L\\) is\nindependent of asbestos exposure A. The observed probability of\nlung cancer is compatible with both of the following probability\ndistributions over our four counterfactual categories:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{doomed}) & = .06,  &\\Pr_2(\\textit{doomed}) &= 0,\\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{immune}) & = .89,  &  \\Pr_2(\\textit{immune}) & = .83,\\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{sensitive}) & = .05, & \\Pr_2(\\textit{sensitive}) & = .11, \\\\\n\\Pr_1(\\textit{reverse}) & = 0 & \\Pr_2(\\textit{reverse}) & = .06\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n \n\nMore generally, the observed probability is compatible with any\nprobability \\(\\Pr'\\) satisfying: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr'(\\textit{doomed}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{senstive}) & = \\Pr(L \\mid A) & = .11;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{immune}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{reverse}) & = \\Pr({\\sim}L \\mid A) &  = .89;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{doomed}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{reverse}) & = \\Pr(L \\mid {\\sim}A) & = .06;\\\\\n\\Pr'(\\textit{immune}) + \\Pr'(\\textit{senstive}) & = \\Pr({\\sim}L \\mid {\\sim}A) & = .94.\\\\\n \\end{aligned}\n    \\]\n\n\n\\(\\Pr_1\\) and \\(\\Pr_2\\) are just the most extreme cases. From the fact\nthat Ted was exposed to asbestos and developed lung cancer, we know\nthat he is either sensitive or doomed. The\ncounterfactual of interest will be true just in case he is\nsensitive. Hence the probability of the counterfactual, given\nthe available evidence, is P(sensitive | sensitive\nor doomed). However, using \\(\\Pr_1\\) yields a conditional\nprobability of .45 (5/11), while \\(\\Pr_2\\) yields a conditional\nprobability of 1. Given the information available to us, all we can\nconclude is that the probability of necessity is between .45 and 1. To\ndetermine the probability more precisely, we would need to know the\nprobability distribution of the error variable.\n\nA closely related counterfactual quantity is what Pearl (2009) calls\nthe probability of sufficiency. Suppose that Teresa, unlike\nTed, was not exposed to asbestos, and did not develop lung cancer. The\nprobability of sufficiency is the probability that she would\nhave suffered lung cancer if she had been exposed. That is,\nthe probability of sufficiency is the probability that if the cause\nwere added to a situation in which it and the effect was absent, it\nwould have resulted in the effect occurring. The probability of\nsufficiency is closely related to the quantity that Sheps (1958)\ncalled the relative difference, and that Cheng (1997) calls\nthe causal power. Cheng\u2019s terminology reflects the idea\nthat the probability of sufficiency of C for E is the\npower of C to bring about E in cases where E is\nabsent. As in the case of the probability of necessity, if one does\nnot have a complete structural equation model, but only a Causal Bayes\nNet or Semi-Markov Causal Model, it is usually only possible to put\nupper and lower bounds on the probability of sufficiency. Using the\nprobabilities from the previous example, the probability of\nsufficiency of asbestos for lung cancer would be between .05 (5/94)\nand .12 (11/94).\n\nDetermining the probabilities of counterfactuals, even just upper and\nlower bounds, is computationally demanding. Balke and Pearl\u2019s\ntwin network method (Balke and Pearl (1994a), (1994b); Pearl (2009,\npp. 213 - 215)) and Richardson and Robins\u2019 split-node method\n(Richardson and Robins (2016)) are two methods that have been proposed\nfor solving this kind of problem.\n5. Further Reading\n\nThe most important works surveyed in this entry are Pearl 2009 and\nSpirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000. Pearl 2010, Pearl et al. 2016,\nand Pearl & Mackenzie 2018 are three overviews of Pearl\u2019s\nprogram. Pearl 2010 is the shortest, but the most technical. Pearl\n& Mackenzie 2018 is the least technical. Scheines 1997 and the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d of Glymour & Cooper 1999 are accessible\nintroductions to the SGS program. Eberhardt 2009, Hausman 1999,\nGlymour 2009, and Hitchcock 2009 are short overviews that cover some\nof the topics raised in this entry.\n\nThe entry on\n causation and manipulability\n contains extensive discussion of interventions, and some discussion\nof causal models.\n\nHalpern (2016) engages with many of the topics in\n Section 3.\n See also the entry for\n counterfactual theories of causation.\n\nThe entry on\n probabilistic causation\n contains some overlap with the present entry. Some of the material from\n Section 4\n of this entry is also presented in Section 3 of that entry. That\nentry contains in addition some discussion of the connection between\nprobabilistic causal models and earlier probabilistic theories of\ncausation.\n\nEberhardt 2017 is a short survey that provides a clear introduction to\nmany of the topics covered in\n Sections 4.2\n through 4.6, as well as Section\n 4.9. Spirtes and\nZhang 2016 is a longer and more technical overview that covers much of\nthe same ground. It has particularly good coverage on the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.5.\n\nThe entries on\n decision theory\n and\n causal decision theory\n present more detailed background information about some of the issues\nraised in\n Section 4.8.\n\nThis entry has focused on topics that are likely to be of most\ninterest to philosophers. There are a number of important technical\nissues that have been largely ignored. Many of these address problems\nthat arise when various simplifying assumptions made here (such as\nacyclicity, and knowledge of the true probabilities) are\nrejected. Some of these issues are briefly surveyed along with\nreferences in\n Supplement on Further Topics in Causal Inference.",
