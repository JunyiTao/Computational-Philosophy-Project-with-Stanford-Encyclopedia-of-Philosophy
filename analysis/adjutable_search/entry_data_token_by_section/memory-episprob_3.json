Memory and Justification\n\nWe seem to have epistemic justification for much of what we believe.\nAnd memory seems to play some role in our having this justification.\nSuppose appearances are correct here. Just what is memory\u2019s\nrole? What can memory do, what can\u2019t it do, and why? There are\nmany theories about the nature of epistemic justification, and they\nmight shed light on memory\u2019s role. Or things might work the\nother way around\u2014our intuitive judgments about memory\u2019s\nrole could shed light on which theories of justification are correct,\nand which we should abandon. This section begins to explore\nmemory\u2019s relationship with justification.\n",
