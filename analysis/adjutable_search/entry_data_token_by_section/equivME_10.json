Although superficially Lange\u2019s (2001, 2002)\ninterpretation seems to fall in this category, as he certainly treats\nmass and energy as different properties, he differs from others in\nthis category because Lange explicitly argues that only mass is a real\nproperty of physical systems. Consequently, we will discuss\nLange\u2019s interpretation separately below (in\n Section 2.3.3).\n\nWe will begin with a discussion of Bondi and Spurgin\u2019s\ninterpretation (in\n Section 2.3.1).\n They hold that mass and energy are distinct properties and that there\nis no such thing as the conversion of mass and energy. We will then\ndiscuss Rindler\u2019s interpretation (in\n Section 2.3.2).\n He maintains that mass and energy are different properties but that\ngenuine conversions of mass and energy are at least permitted by\nmass-energy equivalence.\n2.3.1 Bondi and Spurgin\u2019s Different-Properties, No-Conversion Interpretation\n\nBondi and Spurgin\u2019s (1987) interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence has been influential especially among physicists concerned\nwith physics education. In an article where they complained about how\nstudents often misunderstand Einstein\u2019s famous equation, Bondi\nand Spurgin argued that Einstein\u2019s equation does not entail that\nmass and energy are the same property any more than the equation \\(m =\n\\varrho V\\) (where \\(m\\) is mass, \\(V\\) is volume, and \\(\\varrho\\) is\ndensity) entails that mass and volume are the same. Just as in the\ncase of mass and volume, Bondi and Spurgin argue, mass and energy have\ndifferent dimensions. Ultimately, this reduces to a\ndisagreement with philosophers such as Torretti who would argue that\ntime, as a dimension, is no different than any one of the spatial\ndimensions. Note well that this is not an issue about the\nunits we use for measuring mass (or energy).\n\nEveryone agrees that according to special relativity one can measure\nspatial intervals in units of time. We can do this because of the\npostulate of special relativity that states that the speed of light\nhas the same value in all inertial frames. If we perform what amounts\nto a substitution of variables and take our spatial dimensions to be\n\\(x_n^* = x_n /c\\), where \\(c\\) is the speed of light and \\(n = 1, 2,\n3\\), then we select units in which \\(c = 1\\).\n\nHowever, one can consistently use units in which \\(c = 1\\) and hold\nthat there is nevertheless a fundamental distinction between space and\ntime as dimensions. On such a view, which is the view that Bondi and\nSpurgin seem implicitly to be defending, while time is distinct from\nany given spatial dimension, the contingent fact that \\(c\\) has the\nsame value in all inertial frames allows us to perform the relevant\nsubstitution of variables. However, it does not follow from this that\nwe ought to treat time on a par with any spatial dimension, or that we\nought to treat the saptio-temporal interval as more fundamental (in\nthe way Torretti does).\n\nIn their influential article, Bondi and Spurgin then examine a variety\nof cases of purported conversions of mass and energy. In each case,\nthey show that the purported conversion of mass and energy is best\nunderstood merely as a transformation of energy. In general, Bondi and\nSpurgin argue, whenever we encounter a purported conversion of mass\nand energy, we can always explain what is taking place by looking at\nthe constituents of the physical system in the reaction and examining\nhow energy is proportioned among the constituents before and after the\nreaction takes place.\n\nExplanations of purported \u201cconversions\u201d along the lines\nsuggested by Bondi and Spurgin are now commonplace in the physics\nliterature. These explanations have the merit of emphasizing that in\nmany cases the mysteries of mass-energy equivalence do not\nconcern one physical property magically being transfigured into\nanother. However, the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence has the demerit that it fails to address reactions such as\nthe electron-positron annihilation reaction. In such reactions, not\nonly is the number of particles not conserved, but all of the\nparticles involved are, by hypothesis, indivisible wholes. Thus, the\nenergy liberated in such reactions cannot be explained as resulting\nfrom a transformation of the energy that was originally possessed by\nthe constituents of the reacting particles. Of course, Bondi and\nSpurgin may simply be hoping that physics will reveal that particles\nsuch as electrons and positrons are not indivisible wholes after all.\nIndeed, they may even use annihilation reactions combined with their\ninterpretation of mass-energy equivalence to argue that it cannot be\nthe case that such particles are indivisible. Thus, we witness here\nexplicitly just how closely related interpretations concerning\nmass-energy equivalence can be to views concerning the nature of\nmatter.\n\nThe second demerit of the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation, which it\nshares with all other interpretations of mass-energy equivalence that\nhold that mass and energy are different properties, is that it remains\nsilent about a central feature of physical systems it uses in\nexplaining apparent conversions of mass and energy. In order to\nexplain purported conversions along the lines suggested by\nBondi-Spurgin, one must make the familiar assumption that the energy\nof the constituents of a system, be it potential energy or kinetic\nenergy, \u201ccontributes\u201d to the rest-mass of the system.\nThus, for example, in the bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) reaction Bondi and\nSpurgin must explain the rest-mass of the \\({^7}\\Li\\) in the familiar\nway, as arising from both the sum of the rest-masses of the\nnucleons, and the mass-equivalents of their energies. However, the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation offers no explanation concerning why the\nenergy of the constituents of a physical system, be it potential\nenergy or kinetic energy, manifest itself as part of the\ninertial mass of the system as a whole. Of course, one can\nalways reply that even to ask for this type of explanation is to\nrefuse to accept relativistic thinking fully: the potential and\nkinetic energies of the constituents contributes to the rest energy of\nthe whole, and because of Einstein\u2019s equation, contributes to\nthe rest-mass of the whole.\n\nAs we shall see, Rindler\u2019s interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence attempts to address the first demerit of the Bondi-Spurgin\ninterpretation, while Lange\u2019s interpretation brings to the\nforeground that the energy of the constituents of a physical system\n\u201ccontributes\u201d to that system\u2019s inertial mass.\n2.3.2 Rindler\u2019s Different-Properties, Conversion Interpretation\n\nRindler\u2019s interpretation of mass-energy equivalence is a\nslightly, though importantly, modified version of the Bondi-Spurgin\ninterpretation. Rindler (for example, in 1977), agrees that there are\nmany purported conversions that are best understood as mere\ntransformations of one kind of energy into a different kind of energy.\n\n\nHowever, for Rindler, there is nothing within special relativity\nitself that rules out the possibility that there exists fundamental,\nstructureless particles (i.e., particles that are \u201catomic\u201d\nin the philosophical sense of the term). If such particles\nexist, it is possible according to Einstein\u2019s equation that some\nor all of the mass of such particles \u201cdisappears\u201d and an\nequivalent amount of energy \u201cappears\u201d within the relevant\nphysical system. Thus, Rindler seems to be suggesting that we should\nconfine our interpretation of mass-energy equivalence to what we can\ndeduce from special relativity. Thus, we should hold that\nEinstein\u2019s equation at least allows for genuine conversions of\nmass into energy, in the sense that there may be cases where\na certain amount of inertial mass \u201cdisappears\u201d from\nwithin a physical system and a corresponding amount of energy\n\u201cappears.\u201d Furthermore, in such cases we cannot explain\nthe reaction as merely involving a transformation of one kind of\nenergy into another.\n\nThe merit of Rindler\u2019s interpretation is that it confines the\ninterpretation of Einstein\u2019s equation to what we can validly\ninfer from the postulates of special relativity. Unlike the\ninterpretation proposed by Bondi and Spurgin, Rindler\u2019s\ninterpretation makes no assumptions about the constitution of matter\nbut leaves that for future physics to determine.\n2.3.3 Lange\u2019s One-Property, No-Conversion Interpretation\n\nLange (2001, 2002) has suggested a rather unique interpretation of\nmass-energy equivalence. Lange begins his interpretation by arguing\nthat rest-mass is the only real property of physical systems.\nThis claim by itself suggests that there can be no such thing as a\nphysical process by which mass is converted into energy, for as Lange\nasks \u201cin what sense can mass be converted into energy\nwhen mass and energy are not on a par in terms of their\nreality?\u201d (2002, p.\u00a0227, emphasis in original). Lange then\ngoes on to argue that a careful analysis of purported conversions of\nmass-energy equivalence reveals that there is no physical process by\nwhich mass is ever converted into energy. Instead, Lange argues, the\napparent conversion of mass into energy (or vice versa) is an illusion\nthat arises when we shift our level of analysis in examining a\nphysical system.\n\nLange seems to use a familiar argument from the Lorentz invariance of\ncertain physical quantities to their \u201creality.\u201d For Lange,\nif a physical quantity is not Lorentz invariant, then it is not real\nin the sense that it does not represent \u201cthe objective facts, on\nwhich all inertial frames agree\u201d (2002, p.\u00a0209). Thus Lange\nuses Lorentz invariance as a necessary condition for the\nreality of a physical quantity. However, in several other places, for\nexample when Lange argues for the reality of the Minkowski interval\n(2002, p.\u00a0219) or when he argues for the reality of rest-mass\n(2002, p.\u00a0223), Lange implicitly uses Lorentz invariance as a\nsufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity.\nHowever, if Lange adopts Lorentz-invariance as both a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity, then he\nis committed to the view that rest energy is real for the very same\nreasons he is committed to the view that rest-mass is real. Thus,\nLange\u2019s original suggestion that there can be no physical\nprocess of conversion between mass and energy because they have\ndifferent ontological status seems challenged.\n\nAs it happens, Lange\u2019s overall position is not seriously\nchallenged by the ontological status of rest energy. Lange could\neasily grant that rest energy is a real property of physical systems\nand still argue (i) that there is no such thing as a physical process\nof conversion between mass and energy and (ii) that purported\nconversions result from shifting levels of analysis when we examine a\nphysical system. It is his observations concerning (ii) that force us\nto face again the question of why the energy of the constituents of a\nphysical system manifests itself as the mass of the system, though\nadmittedly the question itself may simply reveal a failure fully to\nappreciate a relativistic description of composite systems. \n\nOne of the main examples that Lange uses to present his interpretation\nof mass-energy equivalence is the heating of an ideal gas, which we\nhave already considered above (see\n Section 1.3).\n He also considers examples involving reactions among sub-atomic\nparticles that, for our purposes, are very similar in the relevant\nrespects to the example we have discussed concerning the bombardment\nand subsequent decomposition of a \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus. In both cases,\nLange essentially adopts the minimal interpretation we discussed in\n Section 1.3.\n In the case of the ideal gas, as we have seen, when the gas sample is\nheated and its inertial mass concurrently increases, this increase in\nrest-mass is not a result of the gas somehow being suddenly (or\ngradually) composed of molecules that are themselves more massive. The\nrest-mass of any individual molecule does not change. It is also not a\nresult of the gas suddenly (or gradually) containing more molecules.\nInstead, the increased kinetic energy of the molecules of the gas\nconstitutes an increase to the rest energy of the gas sample which,\nthrough Einstein\u2019s equation, manifests as an increase in the gas\nsample\u2019s inertial mass. Lange summarizes this feature of the\nincrease in the gas sample\u2019s inertial mass by saying:\n\n\u2026 we have just seen that this \u201cconversion\u201d of energy\ninto mass is not a real physical process at all. We\n\u201cconverted\u201d energy into mass simply by changing our\nperspective on the gas: shifting from initially treating it as\nmany bodies to treating it as a single body [emphasis in original]\n(p.\u00a0236, 2002).\n\n\nUnfortunately, Lange\u2019s characterization threatens to leave\nreaders with the impression that if \u201cwe\u201d had not shifted\nour perspective in the analysis of the gas, no change to the inertial\nmass of the gas sample would have ensued. Of course, it is unlikely\nthat Lange means this. Lange would likely agree that even if no human\nbeings are around to analyze a gas sample, the gas sample will respond\nin any physical interaction differently as a whole after it\nhas absorbed some energy precisely because its inertial mass will have\nincreased.\n\nThe merits of Lange\u2019s view concerning the\n\u201cconversion\u201d of mass-energy equivalence are essentially\nthe same as the merits of both the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation and\nRindler\u2019s interpretation. All these interpretations agree that\nthere are important cases where we have now learned enough to assert\nconfidently that purported \u201cconversions\u201d of mass and\nenergy are merely cases where energy of one kind is transformed into\nenergy of another kind. Aside from the comparatively minor issue\nconcerning the \u201creality\u201d of rest energy, the main demerit\nof Lange\u2019s view is that it might potentially mislead\nunsuspecting readers.\n2.4 Interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) and hypotheses concerning the nature of matter\n\nThe relationship between mass-energy equivalence and hypotheses\nconcerning the nature of matter is twofold. First, as we have\nsuggested, some of the interpretations of mass-energy equivalence seem\nto assume implicitly certain features of matter. Second, some\nphilosophers and physicists, notably Einstein and Infeld (1938) and\nZahar (1989), have argued that mass-energy equivalence has\nconsequences concerning the nature of matter. In this\nsection, we will discuss the first of these two relationships between\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) and hypotheses concerning the nature of matter. We\ndiscuss the second relationship in the next section\n (Section 2.5).\n\nTo explain how some interpretations of mass-energy equivalence rest on\nassumptions concerning the nature of matter, we need first to\nrecognize, as several authors have pointed out, e.g., Rindler (1977),\nStachel and Torretti (1982), and Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990), that\nthe relation one actually derives from the special relativity is:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{7}\nE_o = (m - q)c^2 + K,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(K\\) is merely an additive factor that fixes the zero-point of\nenergy and is conventionally set to zero and \\(q\\) is also routinely\nset to zero. However, unlike the convention to set \\(K\\) to zero,\nsetting \\(q = 0\\) involves a hypothesis concerning the nature of\nmatter, because it rules out the possibility that there exists matter\nthat has mass but which is such that some of its mass can never be\n\u201cconverted\u201d into energy.\n\nThe same-property interpretation of mass-energy equivalence rests\nsquarely on the assumption that \\(q = 0\\). Mass and energy cannot be\nthe same property if there exists matter that has mass some of which\ncannot ever, under any conditions, be \u201cconverted\u201d into\nenergy. However, one could argue that although the same-property\ninterpretation makes this assumption, it is not an\nunjustified assumption. Currently, physicists do not have any\nevidence that there exists matter for which \\(q\\) is not equal to\nzero. Nevertheless, it seems important, from a philosophical point of\nview, to recognize that the same-property interpretation depends not\nonly on what one can derive from the postulates of special relativity,\nbut also on evidence from \u201coutside\u201d this theory.\n\nInterpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that hold that mass and energy are\ndistinct properties of physical systems need not, of course, assume\nthat \\(q\\) is different from zero. Such interpretations can simply\nleave the value of \\(q\\) to be determined empirically, for as we have\nseen such interpretations argue for treating mass and energy as\ndistinct properties on different grounds. Nevertheless, the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation does seem to adopt implicitly a\nhypothesis concerning the nature of matter.\n\nAccording to Bondi and Spurgin, all purported conversions of mass and\nenergy are cases where one type of energy is transformed into another\nkind of energy. This in turn assumes that we can, in all cases,\nunderstand a reaction by examining the constituents of physical\nsystems. If we focus on reactions involving sub-atomic particles, for\nexample, Bondi and Spurgin seem to assume that we can always explain\nsuch reactions by examining the internal structure of sub-atomic\nparticles. However, if we ever find good evidence to support the view\nthat some particles have no internal structure, as it now\nseems to be the case with electrons for example, then we either have\nto give up the Bondi-Spurgin interpretation or use the interpretation\nitself to argue that such seemingly structureless particles actually\ndo contain an internal structure. Thus, it seems that the\nBondi-Spurgin interpretation assumes something like the infinite\ndivisibility of matter, which is clearly a hypothesis that lies\n\u201coutside\u201d special relativity.\n2.5 Ontological interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n\nEinstein and Infeld (1938) and Zahar (1989) have both argued that\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) has ontological consequences. Both of the\nEinstein-Infeld and Zahar interpretations begin by adopting the\nsame-property interpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). Thus,\naccording to both interpretations, mass and energy are the same\nproperties of physical systems. Furthermore, both the Einstein-Infeld\nand Zahar interpretations use a rudimentary distinction between\n\u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cfields.\u201d According to this\nsomewhat dated distinction, classical physics includes two fundamental\nsubstances: matter, by which one means ponderable material stuff, and\nfields, by which one means physical fields such as the electromagnetic\nfield. For both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar, matter and fields in\nclassical physics are distinguished by the properties they bear.\nMatter has both mass and energy, whereas fields only have energy.\nHowever, since the equivalence of mass and energy entails that mass\nand energy are really the same physical property after all, say\nEinstein and Infeld and Zahar, one can no longer distinguish between\nmatter and fields, as both now have both mass and energy.\n\nAlthough both Einstein and Infeld and Zahar use the same basic\nargument, they reach slightly different conclusions. Zahar argues that\nmass-energy equivalence entails that the fundamental stuff of physics\nis a sort of \u201cI-know-not-what\u201d that can manifest itself as\neither matter or field. Einstein and Infeld, on the other hand, in\nplaces seem to argue that we can infer that the fundamental stuff of\nphysics is fields. In other places, however, Einstein and Infeld seem\na bit more cautious and suggest only that one can construct a physics\nwith only fields in its ontology.\n\nThe demerits of either ontological interpretation of mass-energy\nequivalence are that it rests upon the same-property\ninterpretation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\). As we have discussed above (see\n Section 2.4),\n while one can adopt the same-property\ninterpretation, to do so one must make additional assumptions\nconcerning the nature of matter. Furthermore, the ontological\ninterpretation rests on what nowadays seems like a rather crude\ndistinction between \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cfields.\u201d To\nbe sure, mass-energy equivalence has figured prominently in\nphysicists\u2019 conception of matter in no small part because it\ndoes open up the door to a description of what we ordinarily regard as\nponderable matter in terms of fields, since the energy of the field at\none level can manifest itself as mass one level up. However, the\ninference from mass-energy equivalence to the fundamental ontology of\nmodern physics seems far more subtle than either Enstein and Infeld or\nZahar suggest.\n3. History of Derivations of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nEinstein first derived mass-energy equivalence from the principles of\nspecial relativity in a small article titled \u201cDoes the Inertia\nof a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?\u201d (1905b). This\nderivation, along with others that followed soon after (e.g., Planck\n(1906), Von Laue (1911)), uses Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism. (See\n Section 3.1.)\n However, as Einstein later observed (1935), mass-energy equivalence\nis a result that should be independent of any theory that describes a\nspecific physical interaction. This is the main reason that led\nphysicists to search for \u201cpurely dynamical\u201d derivations,\ni.e., derivations that invoke only mechanical concepts such as energy\nand momentum, and the conservation principles that govern them. (See\n Section 3.2)\n3.1 Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) that Use Maxwell\u2019s Theory\n\nEinstein\u2019s original derivation of mass-energy equivalence is the\nbest known in this group. Einstein begins with the following\nthought-experiment: a body at rest (in some inertial frame) emits two\npulses of light of equal energy in opposite directions. Einstein then\nanalyzes this \u201cact of emission\u201d from another inertial\nframe, which is in a state of uniform motion relative to the first. In\nthis analysis, Einstein uses Maxwell\u2019s theory of\nelectromagnetism to calculate the physical properties of the light\npulses (such as their intensity) in the second inertial frame. By\ncomparing the two descriptions of the \u201cact of emission\u201d,\nEinstein arrives at his celebrated result: \u201cthe mass of a body\nis a measure of its energy-content; if the energy changes by \\(L\\),\nthe mass changes in the same sense by \\(L/9 \\times 10^{20}\\), the\nenergy being measured in ergs, and the mass in grammes\u201d (1905b,\np.\u00a071). A similar derivation using the same thought experiment\nbut appealing to the Doppler effect was given by Langevin (1913) (see\nthe discussion of the inertia of energy in Fox (1965, p.\u00a08)).\n\n\nSome philosophers and historians of science claim that\nEinstein\u2019s first derivation is fallacious. For example, in\nThe Concept of Mass, Jammer says: \u201cIt is a curious\nincident in the history of scientific thought that Einstein\u2019s\nown derivation of the formula \\(E = mc^2\\), as published in his\narticle in Annalen der Physik, was basically fallacious. . .\n\u00a0 the result of a petitio principii, the conclusion\nbegging the question\u201d (Jammer, 1961, p.\u00a0177). According to\nJammer, Einstein implicitly assumes what he is trying to prove, viz.,\nthat if a body emits an amount of energy \\(L\\), its inertial mass will\ndecrease by an amount \\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\). Jammer also accuses\nEinstein of assuming the expression for the relativistic kinetic\nenergy of a body. If Einstein made these assumptions, he would be\nguilty of begging the question. However, Stachel and Torretti (1982)\nhave shown convincingly that Einstein\u2019s (1905b) argument is\nsound. They note that Einstein indeed derives the expression for the\nkinetic energy of an \u201celectron\u201d (i.e., a structureless\nparticle with a net charge) in his earlier (1905a) paper. However,\nEinstein nowhere uses this expression in the (1905b) derivation of\nmass-energy equivalence. Stachel and Torretti also show that\nEinstein\u2019s critics overlook two key moves that are sufficient to\nmake Einstein\u2019s derivation sound, since one need not assume that\n\\(\\Delta m = L/c^2\\).\n\nEinstein\u2019s further conclusion that \u201cthe mass of a body is\na measure of its energy content\u201d (1905b, p.\u00a071) does not,\nstrictly speaking, follow from his argument. As Torretti (1996) and\nother philosophers and physicists have observed, Einstein\u2019s\n(1905b) argument allows for the possibility that once a body\u2019s\nenergy store has been entirely used up (and subtracted from the mass\nusing the mass-energy equivalence relation) the remainder is not zero.\nIn other words, it is only an hypothesis in Einstein\u2019s (1905b)\nargument, and indeed in all derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) in special\nrelativity, that no \u201cexotic matter\u201d exists that is\nnot convertible into energy (see Ehlers, Rindler, Penrose,\n(1965) for a discussion of this point). However, particle-antiparticle\nanihilation experiments in atomic physics, which were first observed\ndecades after 1905, strongly support \u201cEinstein\u2019s dauntless\nextrapolation\u201d (Torretti, 1996, p. 112).\n\nIn general, derivations in this group use the same style of reasoning.\nOne typically begins by considering an object that either absorbs or\nemits electromagnetic radiation (typically light) of total energy\n\\(E_o\\) in equal and opposite directions. Because light carries both\nenergy and momentum, one then uses the conservation principles for\nthose quantities and the standard heuristic in relativity of\nconsidering the same physical process from two different inertial\nframes that are in a state of relative motion to show that in order\nfor the conservation principles to be satisfied, the mass (i.e.,\nrest-mass) of the emitting or absorbing object must increase or\ndecrease by an amount \\(E_o /c^2\\). For a more detailed description of\na simplified derivation in this group, see\n Section 1.5\n\n\nOne of the few exceptions to this approach among derivations that use\nMaxwell\u2019s theory is Einstein\u2019s 1906 derivation (Einstein\n1906). In this derivation, Einstein considers a freely-floating box. A\nburst of electromagnetic radiation of energy \\(E_o\\) is emitted inside\nthe box from one wall toward a parallel wall. Einstein shows that the\nprinciple of mechanics that says that the motion of the center of mass\nof a body cannot change merely because of changes inside the body\nwould be violated if one did not attribute an inertial mass \\(E_o\n/c^2\\) to the burst of electromagnetic radiation (see Taylor and\nWheeler 1992, p. 254 for a detailed discussion of this example). \n3.2 Purely Dynamical Derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n\nPurely dynamical derivations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) typically proceed by\nanalyzing an inelastic collision from the point of view of two\ninertial frames in a state of relative motion (the centre-of-mass\nframe, and an inertial frame moving with a relative velocity \\(v)\\).\nOne of the first papers to appear following this approach is\nPerrin\u2019s (1932). According to Rindler and Penrose (1965),\nPerrin\u2019s derivation was based largely on Langevin\u2019s\n\u201celegant\u201d lectures, which were delivered at the\nColl\u00e8ge de France in Zurich around 1922. Einstein himself gave\na purely dynamical derivation (Einstein, 1935), though he nowhere\nmentions either Langevin or Perrin. The most comprehensive derivation\nof this sort was given by Ehlers, Rindler and Penrose (1965). More\nrecently, a purely dynamical version of Einstein\u2019s original\n(1905b) thought experiment, where the particles that are emitted are\nnot photons, has been given by Mermin and Feigenbaum (1990) and Mermin\n(2005).\n\nDerivations in this group are distinctive because they demonstrate\nthat mass-energy equivalence is a consequence of the changes to the\nstructure of spacetime brought about by special relativity. The\nrelationship between mass and energy is independent of Maxwell\u2019s\ntheory or any other theory that describes a specific physical\ninteraction. We can get a glimpse of this by noting that to derive\n\\(E_o = mc^2\\) by analyzing a collision, one must first define the\nfour-momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), the \u201cspace-part\u201d of which is\nrelativistic momentum \\(\\mathbf{p}_{\\rel}\\), and relativistic kinetic\nenergy \\(T_{\\rel}\\), since one cannot use the old Newtonian notions of\nmomentum and kinetic energy. \n\nIn Einstein\u2019s own purely dynamical derivation (1935), more than\nhalf of the paper is devoted to finding the mathematical expressions\nthat define \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\). This much work is required\nto arrive at these expressions for two reasons. First, the changes to\nthe structure of spacetime must be incorporated into the definitions\nof the relativistic quantities. Second, \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\)\nmust be defined so that they reduce to their Newtonian counterparts in\nthe appropriate limit. This last requirement ensures, in effect, that\nspecial relativity will inherit the empirical success of Newtonian\nphysics. Once the definitions of \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and \\(T_{\\rel}\\) are\nobtained, one derives mass-energy equivalence in a straight-forward\nway by analyzing a collision. (For a more detailed discussion of\nEinstein\u2019s (1935), see Fernflores, 2018.)\n\nAt a very general level, purely dynamical derivations of\nEinstein\u2019s equation and derivations that appeal to\nMaxwell\u2019s theory really follow the same approach. In both styles\nof derivations, although it may not seem like it at first glance, we\nare dealing with one of the most basic dynamical interactions: a\ncollision. So, for example, we can construe the physical configuration\nof Einstein\u2019s original 1905 derivation (Einstein 1905b) as a\ncollision in which the total number of objects is not conserved. This\nis even easier to do if one adopts a \u201cparticle\u201d\ndescription of light. In both the purely dynamical derivations and the\nderivations that appeal to an interaction with electromagnetic\nradiation, one then examines the collision in question and shows that\nin order for dynamical principles to be satisfied, the relationship\namong the masses and energies of the objects involved in the\ncollisions must satsify Einstein\u2019s equation. \n\nThe main difference between the two approaches to deriving\nEinstein\u2019s equation is that in derivations that consider a\ncollision with light, one must use the dynamical properties of light,\nwhich are not themselves described by special relativity. For example,\nas we have seen, in Einstein\u2019s 1946 derivation (see\n Section 1.5),\n we must appeal to the expression for the momentum of a burst of\nlight. \n4. Experimental Verification of Mass-Energy Equivalence\n\nCockcroft and Walton (1932) are routinely credited with the first\nexperimental verification of mass-energy equivalence. Cockcroft and\nWalton examined a variety of reactions where different atomic nulcei\nare bombarded by protons. They focussed their attention primarily on\nthe bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) by protons (see\n Section 1.4).\n\nIn their famous paper, Cockcroft and Walton noted that the sum of the\nrest-masses of the proton and the Lithium nucleus (i.e., the\nreactants) was \\(1.0072 + 7.0104 = 8.0176\\) amu. However, the sum of\nthe rest-masses of the two \\(\\alpha\\)-particles (i.e., the products)\nwas 8.0022 amu. Thus, it seems as if an amount of mass of 0.0154 amu\nhas \u201cdisappeared\u201d from the reactants. Cockcroft and Walton\nalso observed that the total energy (in the reference frame in which\nthe \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is at rest) for the reactants was 125 KeV.\nHowever, the total kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles was\nobserved to be 17.2 MeV. Thus, it seems as if an amount of energy of\napproximately 17 MeV has \u201cappeared\u201d in the reaction.\n\nImplicitly referring to the equivalence of mass and energy, without\nexplicitly mentioning either the result or Einstein by name, Cockcroft\nand Walton then simply assert that a mass 0.0154 amu \u201cis\nequivalent to an energy liberation of \\((14.3 \\pm 2.7) \\times 10^6\\)\nVolts\u201d (p.\u00a0236). They then implicitly suggest that this\ninferred value for the kinetic energy of the two resulting\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles is consistent with the observed value\nfor the kinetic energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles. Cockcroft and\nWalton conclude that \u201cthe observed energies of the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles are consistent with our hypothesis\u201d\n(pp.\u00a0236\u2013237). The hypothesis they set out to test,\nhowever, is not mass-energy equivalence, but rather than when a\n\\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus is bombarded with protons, the result is two\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles.\n\nStuewer (1993) has suggested that Cockcroft and Walton use\nmass-energy equivalence to confirm their hypothesis about what happens\nwhen \\({^7}\\Li\\) is bombarded by protons. Hence, it does not seem we\nought to regard this experiment as a confirmation of \\(E_o = mc^2\\).\nHowever, if we take some of the other evidence that Cockcroft and\nWalton provide concerning the identification of the products in the\nbombardment reaction as sufficient to establish that the products are\nindeed \\(\\alpha\\)-particles, then we can interpret this experiment as\na confirmation of mass-energy equivalence, which is how this\nexperiment is often reported in the physics literature.\n\nMore recently, Rainville et al. (2005) have published the results\nof what they call \u201cA direct test of \\(E = mc^2\\).\u201d Their\nexperiments test mass-energy equivalence \u201cdirectly\u201d by\ncomparing the difference in the rest-masses in a neutron capture\nreaction with the energy of the emitted \\(\\gamma\\)-rays. Specifically,\nRainville et al. examine two reactions, one involving neutron capture\nby Sulphur \\((\\S)\\), the other involving neutron capture by Silicon\n\\((\\Si)\\):\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\nn + {^{32}}\\S  &\\rightarrow {^{33}}\\S + \\gamma \\\\\nn + {^{28}}\\Si &\\rightarrow {^{29}}\\Si + \\gamma\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIn these reactions, when the nucleus of an atom (in this case either\n\\({^{32}}\\S\\) or \\({^{28}}\\Si)\\) captures the neutron, a new isotope is\ncreated in an excited state. In returning to its ground state, the\nisotope emits a \\(\\gamma\\)-ray. According to Einstein\u2019s\nequation, the difference in the rest-masses of the neutron plus\nnucleus, on the one hand, and the new isotope in its ground state on\nthe other hand, should be equal to the energy of the emitted photon.\nThus, Rainville et al. test \\(\\Delta E = \\Delta mc^2\\) by making very\naccurate measurements of the rest-mass difference and the frequency,\nand hence energy, of the emitted photon. Rainville et al. report that\ntheir measurements show that Einstein\u2019s equation obtains to an\naccuracy of at least 0.00004%.\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry, we have presented the physics of mass-energy\nequivalence as widely understood by both physicists and philosophers.\nWe have also canvassed a variety of philosophical interpretations of\nmass-energy equivalence. Along the way, we have presented the merits\nand demerits of each interpretation. We have also presented a brief\nhistory of derivations of mass-energy equivalence to emphasize that\nthe equivalence of mass and energy is a direct result to changes to\nthe structure of spacetime imposed by special relativity. Finally, we\nhave briefly and rather selectively discussed the empirical\nconfirmation of mass-energy equivalence.",
