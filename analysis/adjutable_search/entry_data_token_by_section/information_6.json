After a start as a technical term in classical\nand medieval texts the term \u201cinformation\u201d almost vanished\nfrom the philosophical discourse in modern philosophy, but gained\npopularity in colloquial speech. Gradually the term obtained the\nstatus of an abstract mass-noun, a meaning that is orthogonal to the\nclassical process-oriented meaning. In this form it was picked up by\nseveral researchers (Fisher 1925; Shannon 1948) in the twentieth\ncentury who introduced formal methods to measure\n\u201cinformation\u201d. This, in its turn, lead to a revival of the\nphilosophical interest in the concept of information. This complex\nhistory seems to be one of the main reasons for the difficulties in\nformulating a definition of a unified concept of information that\nsatisfies all our intuitions. At least three different meanings of the\nword \u201cinformation\u201d are historically relevant:\n\n\n\u201cInformation\u201d as the process of being\ninformed.\n\nThis is the oldest meaning one finds in the writings of authors like\nCicero (106\u201343 BCE) and Augustine (354\u2013430 CE) and it is\nlost in the modern discourse, although the association of information\nwith processes (i.e., computing, flowing or sending a message) still\nexists. In classical philosophy one could say that when I recognize a\nhorse as such, then the \u201cform\u201d of a horse is planted in my\nmind. This process is my \u201cinformation\u201d of the nature of\nthe horse. Also the act of teaching could be referred to as the\n\u201cinformation\u201d of a pupil. In the same sense one could say\nthat a sculptor creates a sculpture by \u201cinforming\u201d a piece\nof marble. The task of the sculptor is the \u201cinformation\u201d\nof the statue (Capurro & Hj\u00f8rland 2003). This\nprocess-oriented meaning survived quite long in western European\ndiscourse: even in the eighteenth century Robinson Crusoe could refer\nto the education of his servant Friday as his\n\u201cinformation\u201d (Defoe 1719: 261). It is also used in this\nsense by Berkeley: \u201cI love information upon all subjects that\ncome in my way, and especially upon those that are most\nimportant\u201d (Alciphron Dialogue 1, Section 5, Paragraph\n6/10, see Berkeley 1732).\n\n\u201cInformation\u201d as a state of an agent,\n\ni.e., as the result of the process of being informed. If one teaches a\npupil the theorem of Pythagoras then, after this process is completed,\nthe student can be said to \u201chave the information about the\ntheorem of Pythagoras\u201d. In this sense the term\n\u201cinformation\u201d is the result of the same suspect form of\nsubstantiation of a verb (informare \\(\\gt\\)\ninformatio) as many other technical terms in philosophy\n(substance, consciousness, subject, object). This sort of\nterm-formation is notorious for the conceptual difficulties it\ngenerates. Can one derive the fact that I \u201chave\u201d\nconsciousness from the fact that I am conscious? Can one derive the\nfact that I \u201chave\u201d information from the fact that I have\nbeen informed? The transformation to this modern substantiated meaning\nseems to have been gradual and seems to have been general in Western\nEurope at least from the middle of the fifteenth century. In the\nrenaissance a scholar could be referred to as \u201ca man of\ninformation\u201d, much in the same way as we now could say that\nsomeone received an education (Adriaans & van Benthem 2008b;\nCapurro & Hj\u00f8rland 2003). In \u201cEmma\u201d by Jane\nAusten one can read: \u201cMr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of\ninformation beyond the line of his own business. He does not\nread\u201d (Austen 1815: 21).\n\n\u201cInformation\u201d as the disposition to\ninform,\n\ni.e., as a capacity of an object to inform an agent. When the act of\nteaching me Pythagoras\u2019 theorem leaves me with information about\nthis theorem, it is only natural to assume that a text in which the\ntheorem is explained actually \u201ccontains\u201d this information.\nThe text has the capacity to inform me when I read it. In the same\nsense, when I have received information from a teacher, I am capable\nof transmitting this information to another student. Thus information\nbecomes something that can be stored and measured. This last concept\nof information as an abstract mass-noun has gathered wide acceptance\nin modern society and has found its definitive form in the nineteenth\ncentury, allowing Sherlock Homes to make the following observation:\n\u201c\u2026 friend Lestrade held information in his hands the\nvalue of which he did not himself know\u201d (\u201cThe Adventure of\nthe Noble Bachelor\u201d, Conan Doyle 1892). The association with the\ntechnical philosophical notions like \u201cform\u201d and\n\u201cinforming\u201d has vanished from the general consciousness\nalthough the association between information and processes like\nstoring, gathering, computing and teaching still exist.\n\n",
