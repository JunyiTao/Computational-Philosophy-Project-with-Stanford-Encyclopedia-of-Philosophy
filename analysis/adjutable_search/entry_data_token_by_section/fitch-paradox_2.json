    "main_text": "Logical Revisions\n3. Logical Revisions\n\nIn this section we inspect the prospects for treating Fitch\u2019s\nreasoning as invalid. Is Fitch\u2019s epistemic reasoning in order? Is the\nlogic of knowability classical logic? More to the point: does the\nknowability principle carry with it special considerations that\nwarrant the revision of classical logic? If so, does this logical\nrevision invalidate Fitch\u2019s reasoning? And if the reasoning is invalid, are\nthere closely related paradoxes that threaten the knowability\nprinciple without violating the relevant logical standards? \n",
