    "main_text": "Theories of Adjudication\n5. Theories of Adjudication\n\nAdjudication plays a central role in legal institutions and in legal\nphilosophy. This centrality extends beyond the articulation of\ntheories of adjudication. Debates about the concept of law, for\ninstance, generally highlight the role of the judge. For Hart, judges\nare an important subset of those public officials whose social\nacceptance of a rule of recognition constitutes the community\u2019s\nlegal system. For Dworkin, the theory of adjudication itself\ndetermines the content of the law. \n\nEach strand of economic analysis of law has, at least implicitly,\narticulated a theory of adjudication. Doctrinal Analysis as a theory\nof adjudication was discussed in section 2.2. In this section, I\nconsider the theory of adjudication implicit in each of the other two\nstrands of economic analysis of law. \n\nEach theory occurs at the level at which the strand finds the law\ninstrumental. Policy analysis offers a normative theory of\nadjudication that addresses the judge; it specifies that she should\ndecide cases to maximize social welfare. Constitutional political\neconomy, by contrast, offers a normative theory of court structure. It\nspecifies the design of adjudicatory structures within which judges\nwill, of necessity, act in a self-interested fashion. We briefly\ndiscuss each theory in the following subsections. \n",
