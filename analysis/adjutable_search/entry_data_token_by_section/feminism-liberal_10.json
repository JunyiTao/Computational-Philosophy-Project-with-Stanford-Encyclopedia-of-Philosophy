    "main_text": "Classical-Liberal Feminism || Justification\n2.5 Justification\n\nMuch of the classical-liberal feminist literature, especially the\nequity feminist literature, is written for public policy and popular\naudiences, so emphasis is on policy implications rather than\nphilosophical justifications. Nonetheless, we find in the literature a\nvariety of justifications, some consequentialist and some\nnon-consequentialist.\n\nThe most common justification offered in the classical-liberal\nfeminist literature is consequentialist. This argument says that the\npolitical arrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as\ncompared with the alternatives, will provide women with more of what\nis good for them: for example safety, income and wealth, and options.\nLiberalizing guns laws will make women safer (Stevens, et al. 2002);\nlegalizing prostitution and pornography will improve the lives of\nwomen in those trades (Almodovar 2002; Strossen 2000) and open\nopportunities for others; freer markets will root out discrimination\nagainst women and stimulate the proliferation of amenities essential\nto working women, like daycare centers (Epstein 2002: 33; Paul 2002:\n208\u2013209; Stolba & Furchtgott-Roth 2001: 124, 180; Conway\n1998). Indeed, some argue that liberalizing the market will release\nsuch an \u201cexplosion of prosperity\u201d that women will not need\nhelp from a welfare state (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nA variety of non-consequentialist arguments are offered as well. Kirp,\nYudof, and Franks, for example, refer to Kant\u2019s categorical\nimperative and claim that treating individuals as self-owners is what\nis meant by treating individuals as ends in themselves ((Kirp, et al.\n1986: 13\u201314). Wendy McElroy grounds her thought in the natural\nlaw tradition (McElroy 1998b). Some imply a perfectionist\njustification according to which the perfection of the human being\nrequires being treated as a self-owner (Presley 2001).\n",
