    "main_text": "The Causal Mechanical Model || More Recent Developments\n4.4 More Recent Developments\n\nIn more recent work (e.g., Salmon 1994), prompted in part by a desire\nto avoid certain counterexamples advanced by Philip Kitcher (1989) to\nhis characterization of mark transmission, Salmon attempted to fashion\na theory of causal explanation that completely avoids any appeal to\ncounterfactuals. In this new theory which is influenced by the\nconserved process theory of causation of Dowe (2000), Salmon defined a\ncausal process as a process that transmits a non-zero amount of a\nconserved quantity at each moment in its history. Conserved\nquantities are quantities so characterized in physics\u2014linear\nmomentum, angular momentum, charge, and so on. A causal interaction is\nan intersection of world lines associated with causal processes\ninvolving exchange of a conserved quantity. Finally, a process\ntransmits a conserved quantity from A to B if it\npossesses that quantity at every stage without any interactions that\ninvolve an exchange of that quantity in the half-open interval\n \\((A,B]\\).[8]\n\nOne may doubt that this new theory really avoids reliance on\ncounterfactuals, but an even more fundamental difficulty is that it\nstill does not adequately deal with the problem of causal or\nexplanatory relevance described above. That is, we still face the\nproblem that the feature that makes a process causal (transmission of\nsome conserved quantity or other) may tell us little about which\nfeatures of the process are causally or explanatorily relevant to the\noutcome we want to explain. For example, a moving billiard ball will\ntransmit many conserved quantities (linear momentum, angular momentum,\ncharge etc.) and many of these may be exchanged during a collision\nwith another ball. What is it that entitles us to single out the\nlinear momentum of the balls, rather than these other conserved\nquantities as the property that is causally relevant to their\nsubsequent motion? In cases in which there appear to be no\nconservation laws governing the explanatorily relevant property (i.e.,\ncases in which the explanatorily relevant variables are not conserved\nquantities) this difficulty seems even more acute. Properties like\n\u201chaving ingested birth control pills,\u201d \u201cbeing\npregnant\u201d, or \u201cbeing a sample of hexed salt\u201d do not\nthemselves figure in conservation laws. While one may say that both\nbirth control pills and hexed salt are causal processes because both\nconsist, at some underlying level, of processes that unambiguously\ninvolve the transmission of conserved quantities like mass and charge,\nthis observation does not by itself tell us what, if anything, about\nthese underlying processes is relevant to pregnancy or dissolution in\nwater.\n\nIn a more recent paper (Salmon 1997), Salmon conceded this point. He\nagreed that the notion of a causal process cannot by itself capture\nthe notion of causal and explanatory relevance. He suggested, however,\nthat this notion can be adequately captured by appealing to the notion\nof a causal process and information about statistical\nrelevance relationships (that is, information about conditional and\nunconditional (in)dependence relationships), with the latter capturing\nthe element of causal or explanatory dependence that was missing from\nhis previous account:\n\n\nI would now say that (1) statistical relevance relations, in the\nabsence of information about connecting causal processes, lack\nexplanatory import and that (2) connecting causal processes, in the\nabsence of statistical relevance relations, also lack explanatory\nimport. (1997: 476)\n\n\nThis suggestion is not developed in any detail in Salmon\u2019s\npaper, and it is not easy to see how it can be made to work. We noted\nabove that statistical relevance relationships often greatly\nunderdetermine the causal relationships among a set of variables. What\nreason is there to suppose that appealing to the notion of a causal\nprocess, in Salmon\u2019s sense, will always or even usually remove\nthis indeterminacy? We also noted that the notion of a causal process\ncannot capture fine-grained notions of relevance between properties,\nthat there can be causal relevance between properties instances of\nwhich (at least at the level of description at which they are\ncharacterized) are not linked by spatio-temporally continuous or\ntransference of conserved quantities, and that properties can be so\nlinked without being causally relevant (recall the chalk mark that is\ntransmitted from one billiard ball to another). As long as it is\npossible (and why should it not be?) for different causal claims to\nimply the same facts about statistical relevance relationships and for\nthese claims to differ in ways that cannot be fully cashed out in\nterms of Salmon\u2019s notions of causal processes and interactions,\nthis new proposal will fail as well.\n\nSelected Readings: Salmon (1984) provides a detailed\nstatement of the Causal Mechanical model, as originally formulated.\nSalmon (1994 and 1997) provide a restatement of the model and respond\nto criticisms. For discussion and criticism of the CM model,\nsee Kitcher (1989, especially pages 461ff), Woodward (1989), and\nHitchcock (1995).\n",
