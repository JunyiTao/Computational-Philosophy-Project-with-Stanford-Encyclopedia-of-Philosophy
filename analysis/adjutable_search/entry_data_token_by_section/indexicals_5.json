    "main_text": "Which Expressions are Indexicals? || Some Expressions that Have Been Said to Be Indexicals\n2.1 Some Expressions that Have Been Said to Be Indexicals\n\n\nA semantic theory that says that an expression is context-sensitive,\nor is an indexical expression, is a contextualist theory of\nthat expression. A theory that says that an expression is\ncontext-insensitive is an invariantist theory. Below\nis a list of types of expressions for which contextualist theories have\nbeen proposed, along with some discussion.\n\nTense Some theorists hold that sentences containing verbs\nin the present tense vary not only in truth-value from time to time,\nbut also in content, from context to context. For example, some hold\nthat the content of \u2018Fred is hungry\u2019 at a context whose\nassociated time is \\(t\\) is (roughly) that Fred be hungry at\n\\(t\\). The variation in content is said to be due to the\noccurrence of \u2018is\u2019, which is context-sensitive. More\ngenerally, tense markers and tense morphology are claimed to be\ncontext-sensitive expressions. See Reichenbach 1947, Partee 1973, En\u00e7\n1987, Salmon 1989, Ogihara 1996, and King 2003.\n\nModals Paradigmatic modal terms include\n\u2018necessary\u2019 and \u2018necessarily\u2019,\n\u2018possible\u2019 and \u2018possibly\u2019,\n\u2018contingent\u2019 and \u2018contingently\u2019,\n\u2018must\u2019, \u2018might\u2019, \u2018could\u2019,\n\u2018may\u2019, \u2018can\u2019, and \u2018able\u2019. Some\ntheorists would include many more expressions (Portner 2009). Speakers\nwho utter a modal may mean different sorts of modality on different\noccasions. Examples: (a) Someone who utters \u2018Sue can go to the\nparty\u2019 may mean (roughly) that her going to the party is\nconsistent with her plans (practical\nor circumstantial possibility) or instead that her going is\n(merely) consistent with the laws of nature (nomological\npossibility).  (b) If Jill utters \u2018Joe might have been in London\nthis morning\u2019, she may mean that Joe\u2019s being in London is\nconsistent with her knowledge, whereas if Bill utters that same\nsentence, he may mean that Joe\u2019s being in London is consistent\nwith his (Bill\u2019s) knowledge. In both cases, epistemic\npossibility is involved. (c) If Susan utters \u2018Alice might have\nrun three miles\u2019, she might mean that Alice\u2019s having run\nthree miles is consistent with Alice\u2019s metaphysical essence\n(metaphysical possibility) or that Alice\u2019s having run\nis consistent with her (Susan\u2019s) knowledge. (d) Someone who\nutters \u2018Mary may go to school\u2019 may mean that her going to\nschool is morally permissible or instead that it is legally\npermissible. In both cases, a variety of deontic possibility\nis involved. Many theorists attribute the preceding sorts of variation\nto context-sensitivity in the relevant modals. Those who think that\nmodals are semantically like quantifiers over possible worlds\ntypically hold that the content of a modal, in a context, is the same\nas a restricted quantifier over possible worlds, where the relevant\nrestriction varies from context to context. See Kratzer 1977, 2012;\nand Lewis 1979b.\n\nGradable Adjectives Paradigm examples of gradable adjectives\nare \u2018tall\u2019, \u2018old\u2019, \u2018rich\u2019,\n\u2018fast\u2019, \u2018smart\u2019, and \u2018hot\u2019. They\nare called \u2018gradable\u2019 because they can be felicitously\nmodified with adverbs such as \u2018fairly\u2019 and\n\u2018very\u2019. Suppose that Susan is both a professional\nphilosopher and a professional basketball player. A speaker who utters\n\u2018Susan is tall\u2019 might use \u2018tall\u2019 to mean (very\nroughly) tall for a philosopher. That same speaker, on\nanother occasion, might utter \u2018Susan is not tall\u2019 and use\n\u2018not tall\u2019 to mean (roughly) not tall for a basketball\nplayer. Some theorists explain the variability by holding that\ngradable adjectives are context-sensitive. See Kennedy 2007.\n\nAdjectives and Nouns that Optionally Take Complements\nParadigm examples of adjectives of this sort are \u2018ready\u2019,\n\u2018late\u2019, \u2018relevant\u2019, \u2018local\u2019, and\n\u2018eligible\u2019, and paradigm examples of nouns of this sort are\n\u2018neighbor\u2019 and \u2018enemy\u2019. A speaker who utters\n\u2018Tipper is ready\u2019 typically means that Tipper is ready for\n\\(X\\), where \\(X\\) is some event or activity the speaker has\nin mind. In one context, a speaker might mean that Tipper is ready to\nwork; in another context, he might mean that Tipper is ready for a\ncertain party. Therefore, some theorists hold that \u2018ready\u2019\nis context-sensitive. Somewhat similarly, a speaker who utters\n\u2018Smith is a neighbor\u2019 may mean that Smith is a neighbor of\nhis (the speaker\u2019s) or that Smith is a neighbor of someone else (say,\nJones). Again, it may be claimed that \u2018neighbor\u2019 is\ncontext-sensitive. See Partee 1989, Condoravdi and Gawron 1996,\nBach 2005, Gauker 2012.\n\n\n\u2018Know\u2019 Speakers in some contexts may judge that\nthe sentence \u2018John knows that the bank will be open on\nSaturday\u2019 is true. Speakers in other contexts who are aware of\nthe same facts about John may, at the same time, judge that this same\nsentence is false. Consequently some philosophers hold that\n\u2018know\u2019 has different contents in different contexts,\ndepending on the standards of justification that speakers of the\ncontext take for granted, or depending on the epistemic alternatives\nthat are salient to the speakers of that context. See Cohen 1988,\nDeRose 1995, Lewis 1996, and the entry on \n epistemic contextualism.\n\nQuantifier phrases Examples of quantifiers are\n\u2018every\u2019, \u2018all\u2019, \u2018some\u2019,\n\u2018no\u2019, \u2018most\u2019, \u2018many\u2019, and\n\u2018few\u2019. Quantifier phrases are (roughly) noun\nphrases or determiner phrases that include both a quantifier and a\ncommon noun or noun phrase, for example, \u2018every student\u2019,\n\u2018some dog\u2019, and \u2018no black cats\u2019. Two speakers\nwho utter the same sentence containing a quantifier phrase may mean\ndifferent things. If Smith is teaching a class of first-graders and\nutters \u2018Every student has a pencil\u2019, he means something\nlike every student in Smith\u2019s first-grade class has a\npencil\u2019. If Jones is proctoring a multiple-choice exam in a\nlarge college course, and utters that same sentence, then she means\nsomething like every student taking exam E has a pencil,\nwhere \\(E\\) is the relevant exam.  This phenomenon is often\ncalled quantifier-domain restriction.  Some theorists propose\nto explain this variation by hypothesizing that quantifier phrases are\ncontext-sensitive. See von Fintel 1994, Stanley and Szabo 2000.\n\n\nTheorists have proposed contextualist theories for many other\nexpressions, including: Conditionals (Lewis 1973, Kratzer 2012,\n and the entry on \n conditionals); deontic terms, such as \u2018ought\u2019 and\n\u2018should\u2019 (Lewis 1973, Kratzer 2012, Portner 2009);\nperspectival expressions, such as \u2018come\u2019, \u2018go\u2019,\n\u2018left\u2019, \u2018right\u2019, and \u2018behind\u2019\n(Lewis 1979b); weather predicates, such as \u2018rain\u2019 and\n\u2018hot\u2019 (see Sennett 2008 for an overview); propositional\nattitude verbs, such as \u2018believe\u2019 (Richard 1990,\nand the entry on \n propositional attitude reports); common nouns, such as\n\u2018student\u2019 and \u2018table\u2019 (Stanley and Szabo 2000);\nand vague expressions, which include nearly all expressions in natural\nlanguages (Raffman 1996, Soames 1999, Fara 2000, \nand the entry on \n vagueness).\n\n\nIf the above expressions are indexicals, then their contents seem to\ndepend (at least in part) on speakers\u2019 intentions. They are not,\nhowever, appropriately called \u2018true demonstratives\u2019, for\npointing gestures seem completely irrelevant to fixing their contents\nand references. Perry\u2019s term \u2018discretionary\nindexical\u2019 would be more apt.\n",
