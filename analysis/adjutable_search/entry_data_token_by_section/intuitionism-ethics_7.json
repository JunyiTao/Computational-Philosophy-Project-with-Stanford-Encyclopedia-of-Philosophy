    "main_text": "Intuitionist metaphysics || Analyses of concepts and property identity claims.\n2.3 Queerness\n\n\nSome philosophers think that there could be no moral facts as\nintuitionists understand these. This is because such facts would be\nunlike any other facts of which we know. Such philosophers think of\nnon-natural facts and properties as \u2018queer\u2019 (see, Mackie\n1977; Joyce 2001; Olson 2014). This queerness is probably at the heart of many\nphilosophers\u2019 uneasiness about the idea of a non-natural\nproperty. But we need to be clear about what it is that is supposed to\nbe so queer about the non-natural nature of goodness as intuitionists\nunderstand it.\n\n\nThe intuitionist conception of goodness may be regarded as\nmysterious because it is alleged to be unanalysable or indefinable. But\nthat wouldn\u2019t pick up on the non-natural nature that\nintuitionists claim moral properties have. This objection would apply\nto any notion that philosophers claim is primitive in the sense that no\ninformative definition in other terms can be offered, be it the notion\nof explanation, knowledge, or pain. It expresses rather a certain\nphilosophical disappointment that a definition can\u2019t be offered.\nIt is often said that \u201cOne person\u2019s primitive is another\nperson\u2019s mystery\u201d, but this supposed sense of mystery\nattaches to the unanalysability claim rather than the non-naturalness\nclaim.\n\n\nFurthermore, some intuitionists did not think that goodness is\nunanalysable. For instance, Sidgwick thought that good could be\nanalysed as what ought to be desired, and Ewing maintained that it\ncould be analysed as the fitting object of a pro-attitude. If the sense\nof mystery of the intuitionist notion of goodness stems from its\nunanalysability, then this sense of mystery will not apply to these\nintuitionists\u2019 concept of goodness, even though it is still a\nnon-naturalist conception. But critics might respond that these\ndefinitions really only move the mysterious notion elsewhere, e.g., to\nthe unanalysable terms \u2018ought\u2019 and\n\u2018fittingness\u2019.\n\n\nJohn Mackie maintained that moral properties, understood broadly\nalong intuitionist lines, are queer because they are inherently\nmotivational, in the sense that when we come to see that some act is\ngood, we are motivated to do it. No other property we know of has\nsuch inherent motivational force. If such properties could be\nunderstood naturalistically, e.g., as being such as to elicit desire in\nthose who perceive them, then the inherent motivational force of moral\nproperties would not be queer. For if something\u2019s goodness were\nidentical with its being such as to elicit desire when perceived, it\nwould be no surprise that we come to desire it when we perceive\nit. But intuitionists\u2019 non-naturalism rules out this\nexplanation of the intrinsic \u2018to be pursuedness\u2019 of moral\nproperties.\n\n\nIntuitionists may respond to this objection by drawing on a recent\nversion of Ewing\u2019s fitting attitude analysis of goodness. Ewing\nthought that to be good is to be the object of a fitting pro-attitude.\nT. M. Scanlon has argued that goodness is to be understood as\nsomething\u2019s having properties that give us reason to have a\npro-attitude towards it (1998, 95), and like the intuitionist view\nabout goodness and rightness, he thinks that the notion of a reason\ncannot be understood in other, non-normative terms (1998, 17). So his\nview is something intuitionists can accept. If they do, then there\nwould seem to be no mystery about the magnetism of the good. If coming\nto see that something is good is coming to see that we have reason to\nhave a pro-attitude towards it, then it would be no surprise if\nrational individuals come to have a pro-attitude towards perceived\ngoods, any more than it would be surprising if rational beings come to\ndo what they judge they ought to do. If one has Humean leanings\none might want an explanation of how a judgement that one has reason to\nhave an attitude, or that one ought to do something, can by itself\nmotivate. But then the problem is not with the non-natural nature of\nmoral properties, but is one within moral psychology, and involves the\ndebate between those who endorse a Humean theory of motivation, and\nthose who deny this.\n\n\nBut the mystery may be normative rather motivational if we assume,\nfollowing Kant, that moral reasons are categorical reasons. Categorical\nreasons are ones that apply to us independently of what we care\nabout. One might doubt that there are any such reasons. One\nargument for such a view is that normative practical reasons must be\nthe sort of thing from which we can act. So they must be able to\nmotivate us to act, and they can only do that by latching onto\nsomething we care about. But if all practical reasons must be able to\nlatch onto something we care about, then no reasons are categorical in\nthe Kantian sense. So the very idea of a moral reason may be quite\nmysterious and queer.\n\n\nA final mystery is epistemic. It may be maintained that it is quite\nunclear how we can know of moral facts. This mystery may stem from the\nidea that non-natural properties lack causal powers. So the mystery is\nhow we could know of something that is causally impotent. Intuitionists\nmight respond by asking why a property must be causally efficacious if\nwe are to be able to know which things have that property. They may\npoint out that, on some views, dispositional properties such as warmth,\nfragility, or colour properties, lack causal powers. These powers are\nlocated in the non-dispositional base properties on which the\ndispositional properties supervene, rather than in the dispositional\nproperties themselves. If this view were true, that would not imply\nthat we could not know whether something was warm, fragile, or\ncoloured. And if that could be true of non-causal, dispositional\nproperties, then it could be true of causally impotent moral\nproperties.\n\n\nIt may, however, be pressed that the causal impotency of moral\nproperties causes problems for the analogy of intellectual seemings\nwith perceptual seemings. Perceptually things seem to be a certain way,\nsay red or square, because those things and their properties causally\ninteract with our perceptual system. But if moral properties are\ncausally impotent, then causal interaction could not explain why\ncertain things seem to the intellect to be true.\n",
