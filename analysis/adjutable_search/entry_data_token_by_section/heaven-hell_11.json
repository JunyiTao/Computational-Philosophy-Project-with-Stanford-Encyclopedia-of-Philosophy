    "main_text": "The Universalist Rejection of Everlasting Separation || The Limits of God\u2019s Power to Preserve Human Freedom\n4.3 The Limits of God\u2019s Power to Preserve Human Freedom\n\nSuppose that a man is standing atop the Empire State Building with the\nintent of committing suicide by jumping off and plunging to his death\nbelow. One obvious way in which God could interfere with the\nman\u2019s freedom in this matter would be simply to cause him to\nchange his mind; that would effectively prevent the suicide from\noccurring. But there is another, less obvious, way in which God could\ninterfere with the man\u2019s freedom to commit suicide; God could\npermit him to leap from the building and then cause him to float\ngently to the ground like a feather; that too would effectively\nprevent the suicide from occurring. So one is not free to accomplish\nsome action or to achieve some end, unless God permits one to\nexperience the chosen end, however confusedly one may have chosen it;\nand neither is one free to separate oneself from God, or from the\nultimate source of human happiness as Christians understand it, unless\nGod permits one to experience the very life one has chosen and the\nfull measure of misery that it entails.\n\nGiven the almost universal Christian assumption that a complete\nseparation from the divine nature (in the outer darkness, for example)\nwould be an objective horror, it seems to follow that even God would\nface a dilemma with respect to human freedom. For either God could\npermit sinners to follow a path that ultimately leads, according to\nChristian theology, to an objective horror and permit them to continue\nfollowing it for as long as they freely choose to do so, or God could\nat some point prevent them from continuing along their freely chosen\npath. If God should permit sinners to continue along their freely\nchosen path\u2014the one that unbeknownst to them will inevitably\nlead them to an objective horror\u2014then their own experience,\nprovided they are rational enough to qualify as free moral agents,\nwould eventually shatter their illusions and remove their\nlibertarian freedom to continue along that path.\nAlternatively, if God should prevent sinners from achieving their\nfreely chosen goal of separating themselves from the divine nature,\nthen they would have no real freedom to do so. In neither case,\ntherefore, would sinners be able to retain forever their libertarian\nfreedom to continue separating themselves from the divine nature and\nfrom the ultimate source of human happiness. \n\nIf this argument should be sound, it also seems to follow that, no\nmatter how tenaciously some sinners might pursue a life apart from God\nand resist the divine purpose for their lives, God would have, as a\nsort of last resort, a sure-fire way to shatter the illusions that\nmake their rebellion possible in the first place. To do so, God need\nonly honor their own free choices and permit them to experience the\nvery life they have confusedly chosen for themselves. Why interfere\nwith someone\u2019s freedom, after all, at the very point where\nhonoring that freedom would in fact teach a hard lesson and therefore\ndo the most good? Would that not be utterly incompatible with\nGod\u2019s moral character, as most Christians understand it? \n\nHowever one might answer such a question, the Christian\nuniversalist\u2019s understanding of the nature and scope of\nGod\u2019s irresistible grace is very different from the Augustinian\nunderstanding of it. For Christian universalists not only reject the\nAugustinian idea that God\u2019s irresistible grace extends to a\nlimited elect only; they also hold that God\u2019s judgment of sin is\nessentially a matter of permitting sinners to experience the very\ncondition of separation they have confusedly chosen for themselves.\nMany Christian universalists are thus fond of quoting St. Paul\u2019s\nremark that \u201cGod has bound everyone over to disobedience so that\nhe may have mercy on them all\u201d (Rom. 11:32\u2014NIV), and they\ninterpret this as a declaration that divine judgment, however harsh it\nmay seem, is itself an expression of divine mercy and is therefore\npart of what makes God\u2019s grace irresistible in the end. If, as a\nlast resort, God should allow a sinner to live for a while without\neven an implicit experience of the divine\n nature,[11]\n the resulting horror, they believe, will at last shatter any illusion\nthat some good is achievable apart from God; and such a discovery will\nfinally elicit a cry for help of a kind that, however faint it may be,\nis just what God needs in order to begin and eventually to complete\nthe process of reconciliation. \n\nIn sum, opponents of universalism must either restrict God\u2019s\nredemptive love to a limited elect or admit that God\u2019s love will\nsuffer an ultimate defeat in this sense: God\u2019s own desire for\nthe human race as a whole, as expressed in a place like 1 Timothy 2:4,\nwill never be satisfied. Because the Arminians and the universalists\nagree that God could never love an elect mother even as, at the same\ntime, God rejects her beloved baby, they both agree that the first\nalternative is utterly impossible. But because the issues surrounding\nthe idea of free will are so complex and remain the source of so much\nphilosophical controversy, perhaps they can also agree that a\nfree\u2013will theodicy of hell is the best philosophical account\ncurrently available for a doctrine of everlasting separation from God.\n\n",
