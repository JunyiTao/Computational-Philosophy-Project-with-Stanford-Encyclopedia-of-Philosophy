The Ethics of Embodiment\n\nThe work on bodily imaginaries from within the phenomenological\nframework, makes explicit the extent to which our embodied identities\nare dependent on the responses of others. They are negotiated\nintersubjectively, linked to the possible pattern of social\ninteractions within which we can recognizably be placed. It is also\nclear that the imaginaries which are normatively attached to certain\nbodily morphologies can be restricting and damaging. Both Beauvoir and\nFanon described the damaging consequences of encountering the myths\nand images carried by female and black bodies, which become\ninternalized to mediate our embodied sense of self. The work of many\ntheorists of bodily abilities point to the norms surrounding bodily\nshape and form in relation to which non normative bodies are seen as\nfreaks and monsters. (Garland-Thomson 1997). Mairs admits experiencing\nshame of her body: \n\n\nit is a crippled body. Thus it is doubly other, not merely by the\n\u2026 standards of patriarchal culture but by the standards of\nphysical desirability erected for everybody in our world\u2026. My\nbelly sags from loss of muscle tone, which also creates all kind of\nintestinal disruptions, hopelessly humiliating in a society in which\nexcretory functions remain strictly unspeakable. (Mairs 1990 [1997:\n299, 301]) \n\n\nThe way Mairs experiences her body is formed in relation to\nnormalizing discourses in which the \u201ccrippled\u201d body, in\nparticular the \u201cdesiring crippled body\u201d, is banished to\nthe realm of the rejected, often unthinkable, other. The blossoming of\nthe aesthetic surgery industry amongst women, and increasingly men, is\na consequence of an increasingly narrow set of bodily morphologies\nbeing accepted as attractive and desirable, Moreover these\nmorphologies are usually of young bodies. This fuels the demand for\nbody modification of aging bodies. (Alsop and Lennon 2018; Dolezal\n2015; Gilman 1999; Heyes and Jones 2009).\n\nAs a consequence of these insights, there is increasing work amongst\nfeminist philosophers concerning the ethics of embodiment.\nWeiss (2015) points to \n\n\nspecific feminist philosophers, critical race scholars, and disability\ntheorists who \u2026 illustrate, and ultimately combat, the\ninsidious ways in which sexism, racism, and \u201ccompulsory\nable-bodiedness\u201d (McRuer 2006), impoverish the lived experience\nof both oppressors and the oppressed, largely by predetermining the\nmeaning of their bodily interactions in accordance with\ninstitutionalized cultural expectations and norms. (2015: 77) \n\n\nThere are two special issues of the feminist journal Hypatia\n(Bergoffen and Weiss 2011, 2012) devoted to the ethics of embodiment,\ndealing with the implications of situating bodies at the center of\nethical theory. This requires looking at the operation of bodily\nnorms, and which bodies and modes of comportment are valued and which\nnot. It also requires engaging with bodily vulnerability in relation\nto the normative human and ethical ideals of autonomy and subjecthood.\nGarland-Thomson discusses what she terms \u201cmisfitting\u201d, a\nlack of fit between body and world and between our bodies and other\npeoples (2011, also Bergoffen and Weiss 2011). When we fit\nharmoniously and properly into the world, we forget the contingency of\nthis, because the world sustains us. \n\n\nWhen we experience misfitting and recognize that disjuncture for its\npolitical potential, we expose the relational component and the\nfragility of fitting. Any of us can fit here today and misfit there\ntomorrow. (Garland-Thomson 2011: 597)\n\n\nOur bodily vulnerability, and consequently our vulnerability to\nothers, is also central to the later work of Butler. It is through the\nbody that we become vulnerable to our material environment and to the\nviolence which may be inflicted on us by others: \u201cliving in a\nworld of beings who are \u2026physically dependent on one another,\nphysically vulnerable to one another\u201d (2004: 22). The\nvulnerability to social punishments and the threats of violence attach\nparticularly to those who fail to conform to social norms. But Butler\nstresses the vulnerability and precariousness of everyone\u2019s\nsubjectivity, formed as it is by public systems of meaning which are\nthemselves precarious and crisscrossed by differences. We are affected\nby the outside, the social and familial bonds, which enable us to\nassume subjectivity and agency, but are also injurious to us in\nclosing down possibilities for our ways of being. \n\n\nI am affected not just by this one other or set of others, but by a\nworld in which humans, institutions and organic and inorganic\nprocesses all impress themselves upon this me, who is, at the onset,\nsusceptible in ways that are radically involuntary. (2015: 6/7) \n\n\nSuch susceptibility is for her, the mode of being of embodied\nsensibility. (See Gonzalez-Arnal, Jagger and Lennon (eds.) 2012, for\npapers highlighting the distinctiveness of different modes of\nembodiment and the vulnerability of the body to pain and assault. Also\nsee Widdows 2018 for a discussion of Beauty as an Ethical Ideal and the entry on\n feminist perspectives on disability).\n",
