    "main_text": "Empirical Work on the Public-Goods Problem || Public Goods Games\n5.1 Public Goods Games\n\nA typical public goods game set-up is as follows. A number n\nof university students is brought into a room and seated at a table.\nThey each receive an endowment of, say, \u20acx. They are then asked\nto decide how much of that to spend on a group project, where\ncontributions can range from \u20ac0 to the entire endowment. They put\ntheir contributions into an envelope so that other participants cannot\nsee how much each individual has contributed. The sum total of the\ncontributions is then doubled by the experimenter and divided equally\namong the participants.\n\nA public goods game is an n-person Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma.\nThe Pareto optimal outcome is one in which everyone contributes their\nentire endowment. With \\(n = 10\\) participants and an endowment of \\(x\n= \u20ac10,\\) each participant would wind up with \\(\u20ac20.\\) But\neach individual has an incentive to contribute less. If everyone\nelse contributed their entire endowment, each individual\ncould receive up to \\(9*\u20ac10*2/10+\u20ac10 = \u20ac28\\) if they\ncontributed nothing. This is the same for everyone in the game, and so\nthe Nash equilibrium strategy is to contribute \\(\u20ac0,\\) resulting\nin a payoff of \\(\u20ac10\\) for each participant.\n\nIn experiments, the Nash-equilibrium strategy is typically played by\nonly some of the players. Others contribute their entire endowment and\nyet others a sum in between. Total contributions typically lie between\n40% and 60% of the social optimum. Other stylised facts include\n(Ledyard 1995: 13):\n\n In one-shot trials and in the initial stages of finitely repeated\ntrials, subjects generally provide contributions halfway between the\nPareto-efficient level and the free riding level,\n Contributions decline with repetition, and\n Face to face communication improves the rate of\ncontribution.\n\n\nThe first two points have been described as \u201covercontribution\nand decay\u201d (Guala 2005): people tend to contribute more than we\nwould expect from a purely strategic point of view, but these\novercontributions decline when the game is played repeatedly (though\nnever to zero). Thus, people free ride less than advocates of\ngovernment funding of public goods often suggest, but private\nprovision is still at suboptimal levels.\n\nThere are a number of explanations for these phenomena. An obvious one\nis experience and learning: as players become more experienced with\nthe set up, they come to understand that they can profit from\nnon-co-operation (especially when others are slower to learn that\nlesson). Another one is that players\u2019 behaviour is motivated by\ndifferent considerations. Jon Elster describes six different types of\nco-operative behaviour:\n\n\nCooperation needs some individuals who are not motivated merely by the\ncosts and benefits to them. Two categories of such individuals are\nwhat we shall call full utilitarians and selfless\nutilitarians. The first will cooperate if and only if their\ncontribution increases the average benefit. [\u2026] The second\ncategory will cooperate if and only if their contribution increases\nthe average benefit, not counting the costs to them\u2026\n\n\nIf the selfless utilitarians are too few, or if the predicament I\ndescribed deters them from acting, unconditional cooperators\nare needed\u2026 These actors take a number of shapes\u2014they may\nbe Kantians, saints, heroes, fanatics, or they may be slightly mad.\nWhat they have in common is that they act neither as a function of the\nexpected consequences of their action, nor as a function of the number\nof other cooperators.\n\nA further category of actors would never act as first movers, however.\nThese are the individuals whose motivation is triggered by the\nobservation of others\u2019 cooperating or by the knowledge that\ncooperators can observe them\u2026 A first subset of this group are\nmotivated by the quasi-moral norm of fairness: it is not fair for us\nto remain on the sidelines while others are taking risks for our\ncommon cause. [\u2026] A second subset are motivated by social\nnorms. If noncooperators can be identified and subjected to social\nostracism, as is usually the case at the workplace, for example,\ncooperators may shame them into joining.\n\nA final category are those who join the movement for its\n\u201cprocess benefits\u201d\u2014because it is fun or otherwise\npersonally appealing. (Elster 2007: 397\u20139; emphasis in\noriginal)\n\n\nThe presence of a certain proportion of conditional co-operators would\nexplain why contributions start relatively high but go down over time.\nEmpirical investigations confirm this explanation as well as the\npresence of \u201cmixed motives\u201d (Villeval 2012). In a classic\npaper, James Andreoni has argued that patterns observed in the data\nabout charitable giving from U.S. national surveys are inconsistent\nwith a model of pure altruism so that other motivations must be\nincluded to account for these data (Andreoni 1988).\n\nA large number of factors appears to affect the size of the\ncontributions. Apart from repetition (one-shot vs repeated games and\nnumber of rounds), experience and learning, and communication, the\nmarginal payoff of contributions, the size of the group, provision\npoints (in some experiments the public good is provided only if\ncontributions reach a certain threshold), the heterogeneity of payoffs\nand endowments, and moral suasion (i.e., the priming of experimental\nsubjects by experimenters) are among the factors that make a\ndifference (Ledyard 1995: 36). Some results are quite surprising. For\nexample, contributions increase with increasing thresholds at which\nthe public good is provided while the probability that the threshold\nwill be reached goes down (Isaac, Walker, & Thomas 1984). However,\nwith heterogeneous endowments, there are no significant differences of\ncontributions at different levels (Rapoport & Suleiman 1993).\nSimilarly, contrary to economists\u2019 expectations, group size can\nhave a positive effect on contributions while it dilutes the\neffect of marginal returns (Isaac, Walker, & Williams 1994). That\ncausal factors affect experimental results in unsystematic and quite\nunexpected ways appears to be a fairly general feature of experimental\neconomics (Reiss 2008: Ch. 5).\n",
