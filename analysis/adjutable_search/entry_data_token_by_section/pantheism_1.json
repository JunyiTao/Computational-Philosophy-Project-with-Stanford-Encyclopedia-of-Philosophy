    "main_text": "Arguments for / drives towards pantheism\n2. Arguments for / drives towards pantheism\n\nA good way to understand any view is to appreciate the kind of drives\nthat may push someone towards it. What arguments may be given for\npantheism? Although there are a great many different individual lines\nof reasoning that might be offered, generally they may be placed under\ntwo heads; arguments \u2018from below\u2019, which start from a\nposteriori religious experience, and arguments \u2018from\nabove\u2019, which start from a priori philosophical\nabstraction.\n\nFollowing the first type of argument, pantheistic belief arises when\nthe things of this world excite a particular sort of religious\nreaction in us. We feel, perhaps, a deep reverence for and\nsense of identity with the world in which we find\nourselves. Epistemically it seems to us that God is not distant but\ncan be encountered directly in what we experience around us. We see\nGod in everything. The initial focus of attention here may be either\nour physical environment (the land on which we live, our natural\nenvironment) or else our social environment (our community, our tribe,\nour nation or, generally, the people we meet with) but further\nreflection may lead to its more universal expansion.\n\nIn the second kind of argument, reasoning starts from a relatively\nabstract concept whose application is taken as assured, but further\nreflection leads to the conclusion that its scope must be extended to\ninclude the whole of reality. Most typically, the concept in question\nis that of \u2018God\u2019, or \u2018perfect being\u2019, in which\ncase pantheism appears as the logical terminus or completion of\ntheism. The following paragraphs illustrate four examples of such\nreasoning.\n\n(1) Traditional theism asserts the omnipresence of God and,\nwhile it strongly wishes to maintain that this is not equivalent to\npantheism, the difference between saying that God is present\neverywhere in everything and saying that God is\neverything is far from easy to explain. If omnipresence means, not\nsimply that God is cognisant of or active in all places, but literally\nthat he exists everywhere, then it is hard to see how any finite being\ncan be said to have existence external to God. Indeed, for Isaac\nNewton and Samuel Clarke divine omnipresence was one and the same\nthing as space, which they understood as \u2018the sensorium of\nGod\u2019 (Oakes 2006). One recent variant of this position is\nLogical Pantheism according to which God is identified with\nlogical space, with the totality of all possible worlds.\n(Aranyosi 2022)\n\n(2) The traditional theistic position that God\u2019s creation of the\nuniverse is continuous can easily be developed in pantheistic\ndirections. The view that the world could not exist\u2014even for a\nsecond\u2014without God, makes it wholly dependent on God and, hence,\nnot really an autonomous entity (Oakes 1983). Moreover, to further\ndevelop this argument, if God creates every temporal stage of every\nobject in the universe, this undermines the causal power of individual\nthings and leads to occasionalism, which in turn encourages pantheism;\nfor in so far as independent agency is a clear mark of independent\nbeing, the occasionalist doctrine that all genuine agency is\ndivine\u2014that it all comes from a single place\u2014tends to\nundermine the distinction of things from God. Both Malebranche and\nJonathan Edwards have found themselves charged with pantheism on these\ngrounds, and it was for this reason that Leibniz, in attempting to\nrefute the pantheistic monism of Spinoza, felt it most important to\nassert the autonomous agency of finite beings (Crisp 2019).\n\n(3) Alternatively it might be argued that God\u2019s\nomniscience is indistinguishable from reality itself. For if\nthere obtains a complete mapping between God\u2019s knowledge and the\nworld that God knows, what basis can be found for distinguishing\nbetween them, there being not even the possibility of a mismatch?\nMoreover, were we to separate the two, since knowledge tracks\nreality\u2014we know something because it is the case and not\nvice versa\u2014then God would become problematically\ndependent upon the world (Mander 2000).\n\n(4) Arguments of this general type may also proceed from starting\npoints more philosophical than theological. For example, Spinoza, the\nmost famous of all modern pantheists starts from the necessary\nexistence of something he calls \u2018substance.\u2019 By this he\nmeans that which exists wholly in its own right, that whose existence\ndoes not depend upon anything else. The notion of \u2018the\nAbsolute\u2019, or wholly unconditioned reality, as it figures in the\nphilosophies of Schelling, Hegel, and the British Idealists may be\nconsidered a related development of the same philosophical starting\npoint (see Thomas 2019). In both cases the reasoning runs that this\nnecessary being must be all-inclusive and, hence, divine.\n",
