    "main_text": "The Specter of Liberation: The Great Refusal and the New Sensibility\n8. Marcuse and Feminism\n\n\nMarcuse\u2019s search for a form of radical subjectivity that could\nserve as an impetus for revolution or social transformation led him\ndown a path not traveled by his Frankfurt School colleagues. \nIndeed, one of the criticisms of Marcuse is that he gave in to\npessimism and gave up on the working class as revolutionary\nsubject. For Marcuse, we must look to \u201cthe substratum of\nthe outcasts and outsiders, etc,\u201d for any social change\n(MacIntyre 1970: 87). \n One of the social movements that Marcuse turns to is the feminist\nmovement. On March 7, 1974 Marcuse gave a paper at Stanford University\nentitled, \u201cMarxism and Feminism\u201d. In it he states:\n\n I believe the women\u2019s liberation movement today is, perhaps\nthe most important and potentially the most radical political movement\nthat we have. (Marcuse 2005a: 165)\n\n For Marcuse, the women\u2019s liberation movement was important\nnot only for the liberation of women, but also for the liberation of\nall oppressed people in our society. His hope was that the struggle\nfor the liberation of women would create a new type of performance\nprinciple and aid in the cultivation of a new sensibility. In short,\ncertain feminine qualities would replace brutish, violent, masculine\nqualities. Marcuse actually advocated a form of androgyny. \n One of the main criticisms of Marcuse\u2019s attitude toward\nfeminism is that he simply reinforces gendered stereotypes as he falls\nback into essentialism. Nina Power has recently defended Marcuse\nagainst this charge. Her argument is similar to the one that Marcuse\nmade in an interview with Brian Magee in 1978. Power and Marcuse both\nargue that although so-called feminine categories are social\nconstructs, they still can be universalized in such a way that all\nhuman beings develop a new sensibility. Power states that:\n\n\nFeminist socialism would universalize these so-called feminine\ncharacteristics so that they were no longer specifically\n\u201cfeminine\u201d at all but would characterize all culture,\nculminating in androgyny. Residual aggression would be channeled into\n\u201cthe destruction of the ugly destructiveness of\ncapitalism,\u201d in Marcuse\u2019s rather neat phrase. \u201cFeminism\nis a revolt against decaying capitalism\u201d and will ultimately\nhave to develop its \u201cown morality\u201d. (Power 2013: 79)\n\nFeminists such as Jessica Benjamin and Nancy Chodorow have pointed\nout a particular weakness in Marcuse\u2019s critical theory that was\nnever addressed by Marcuse himself. For both thinkers,\nMarcuse\u2019s reliance on Freud\u2019s drive theory as that which\nmight produce the need for social change is inadequate because he fails\nto account for the intersubjective development of the individual. \n",
