The Laws\u2019 Relation to the Republic\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, the Laws undertakes to create a good\ncity and to discuss political theory, ethics, psychology, and other\ntopics relevant to the creation of such a city. This makes it very\nnatural to ask what the relation between the Laws and the\nRepublic is. The predominant view, until fairly recently,\nholds that the Republic is Plato\u2019s statement of what\nthe ideally best city is; the Laws, on the other hand,\ndescribes the city that would be best, given less optimistic\nassumptions about what human nature is capable of. This position has\ntwo variants, depending on one\u2019s view of whether Plato at the\ntime of the Republic thought that its political program was\ncompatible with human nature. If one thinks that even at the time of\nthe Republic, Plato thought that its ideal city placed too\ngreat demands on its citizens to be psychologically realizable, then\none can hold that the Laws is entirely consistent with the\nRepublic: they could, at least as far as their philosophical\npositions are concerned, have been written at the same\n time.[15]\n If, on the other hand, one thinks that Plato held that the city of\nthe Republic was psychologically possible, even if difficult\nto realize, it is natural to see the Laws as the outcome of a\nchange in Plato\u2019s views about human\n nature.[16]\n The first view faces two challenges:\n\nproviding evidence from the Republic that Plato did not\nthink its ideal city was realizable, and\neither explaining why the Republic does not at least\ngesture in the direction of the arrangements of the Laws as\nthe best humanly possible option or arguing that we can find such\nevidence.\n\n\nThe second view should explain why Plato becomes more pessimistic\nabout human nature. The need for such an explanation is especially\npressing, since the most common attempt to do so by appealing to\nPlato\u2019s experiences in Sicily is philosophically quite\n unsatisfactory.[17]\n\nIn recent years, it has been argued that there are deep and pervasive\ndifferences between the Republic and the Laws (and\nmore generally between the dialogues of Group 3 and those of Group 2)\non ethical and political\n questions.[18]\n The debate over these claims is just in its initial stages and no\nscholarly consensus has yet emerged. Among other topics relevant to\nthe interpretation of the Laws, this entry sketches a few\nimportant topics of contemporary controversy and then points to lines\nof future research. To begin, perhaps the most important passage in\nthe Laws directly bearing on its relation to the\nRepublic comes in Book 5. There, in what is nowadays perhaps\nthe most famous passage in the Laws, the Athenian announces\nthat they are to engage in the construction of a\n\u201csecond-best\u201d city.\n\nAnyone who uses reason and experience will recognize that a\nsecond-best city [deuter\u00f4s \u2026 pros to beltiston]\nis to be constructed \u2026 That city and that constitution are\nfirst, and the laws are best, where the old proverb holds as much as\npossible throughout the whole city: it is said that the things of\nfriends really are in common. (Laws 739A3\u2013740C3)\n\n\nThe traditional assumption is that Plato here endorses the city\nsketched in the Republic as the best possible city, but now\nthinks that the demands it places on its inhabitants are too high: the\ncity in the Laws is the second-best, but is the best that is\nlikely to be compatible with human nature. It is also sometimes\nthought to follow from this that Plato still endorses the basic\nelements of the Republic\u2019s political and ethical\ntheory.\n\nBut such an interpretation misreads the passage. Even if Plato were to\nendorse the political arrangements of the Republic as the\nbest possible ones, it would not follow that he also endorses all the\nclaims concerning political theory made in the Republic, much\nless that he endorses all of the Republic\u2019s claims in\nethics, psychology and epistemology. The political arrangements of the\nRepublic are entailed by, and are consistent with, many\ndifferent sets of premises, some of which are mutually inconsistent.\nNor does the present passage endorse all of the political structures\nof the Republic, rather it endorses the community of\nproperty, women and children and the goal of making the city as\nunified as possible. But what is most important is that this passage\ndoes not in fact endorse the Republic\u2019s method for\nmaking the city one by introducing a certain kind of community of\nproperty and families. In the Republic, these institutions\nare restricted to the first two classes, but are rejected for the\nthird class, the producers. The Laws passage presents as the\n\u201cfirst-best\u201d city, not that of the Republic, but\none in which there is, throughout the entire city, a community of\nproperty and of women and children. So the claim that the city\nsketched in the Laws is second-best does not suggest that the\nRepublic still represents Plato\u2019s ideal political\n arrangement.[19]\n What the Laws represents as the ideal \u2013 that is to be\napproximated as closely as possible \u2013 is a city in which all\ncitizens are subject to the same extremely high ethical demands.\n",
