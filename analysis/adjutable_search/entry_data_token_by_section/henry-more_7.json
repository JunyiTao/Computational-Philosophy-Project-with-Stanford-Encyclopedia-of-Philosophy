Necessitarian Theology and New Threats\n\nMore knew, from the time he wrote his Antidote Against\nAtheism, that Descartes\u2019s philosophy was being appropriated\nby atheists for their own purposes. It must have been with some dismay\nthat he realised this was a rising tide which his own writings did\nnothing to quell. And then, as if Cartesian atheism and Hobbesianism\nwere not enough, he heard in the 1670s of new threats to sound\nreligion. One of these was Spinozism, which appalled More as much as\nit did every other devout believer. The other atheistic threat, dubbed\nhylozoism by More, was represented by the much less well known English\nmedical writer, Francis Glisson (1597\u20131677), formerly Regius\nprofessor of Physick (i.e. medicine) at Cambridge.\n\nMore wrote two short attacks on Spinoza, one against the Tractatus\ntheologico-politicus (1670), which More read in 1677, and one\nagainst the \u201ctwo pillars\u201d of Spinoza\u2019s atheism, the\nnecessary existence of substance and that there is only one substance.\nMore, like others among his contemporaries, saw Spinoza as taking\nCartesianism to a predictably atheistic extreme. Misled by\nDescartes\u2019s identification of extension with matter, Spinoza\nconcluded that there was only one substance, matter. More was writing\nbefore the term pantheism became current and so he saw Spinoza\u2019s\nidentification of this one substance with God simply as atheism.\nSpinoza confused the divine nature with the nature of created things,\naccording to More, and this was tantamount to atheism. In his\nconfutation of Spinoza More adopted Descartes\u2019s ontological\nargument for the existence of God, based on God\u2019s absolute\nperfection, to insist that matter cannot be an Ens summe et\nabsolute perfectum, and so cannot be identified with God.\nIronically, however, More\u2019s near identification of God with\nspace, and his insistence on the spatial extension of God, which many\ncontemporaries saw as a materialist position (Henry 1986), led a\nnumber of Enlightenment philosophers, most notably Cristian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754), to see him as sharing in a number of the same\nerrors as Spinoza (Leech 2013).\n\nMore seems to have written both of his anti-Spinozistic tracts\nhurriedly, as he was preparing the Latin translations of his works for\ninclusion in the second and third volumes of his Opera omnia\nin 1679 (volume 1 had already appeared in 1675). Indeed, he told Anne\nConway that he \u201ccould not forbeare\u201d from confuting Spinoza\nwhile he was still in the process of reading him. Both of these\ncritiques of Spinoza, were included at the end of volume two and there\nis little evidence that they made any impression on contemporary\nreaders (Hutton 1984, Henry 1987). In the attack on Spinoza\u2019s\nTractatus, however, More included an attempted refutation of\nthe claims of Francis Glisson (which More likened to Spinoza\u2019s\nviews) that all matter, whether animate or inanimate, is capable of\nperception, is appetitive, and therefore in some sense alive. This did\nattract critical attention.\n\nGlisson had arrived at his position as a result of physiological\nresearch on the stomach and intestines, in which he noticed that these\nand other parts of the body were sensitive to touch even though there\nwere no nerves present. This is the phenomenon now known as\nirritability, but in his efforts to explain it Glisson had developed a\ngeneral theory of matter and body and had published it in his\nTreatise on the Energetic Nature of Substance (Tractatus\nde natura substantiae energetica, seu, de vita naturae,\n1672).\n\nMore\u2019s attack on Glisson drew a response from the leading\nPresbyterian divine, Richard Baxter (1615\u20131691) (Henry 1987,\nSytsma 2017). Glisson had been Baxter\u2019s physician, so presumably\nBaxter knew him not to be an atheist, but Baxter was not motivated to\ndefend Glisson merely by friendship. As a Calvinist, Baxter subscribed\nto a voluntarist theology and was appalled by the implications of\nMore\u2019s necessitarian theology. More\u2019s rejection of\nGlisson\u2019s theory depended upon his claim that matter had to be\nnecessarily inert and that only spirit could be\nself-active\u2014according to More, not even God could change this,\nbecause it was inherent in the very nature of matter that it must be\ninert, and definitive of spirit that it must be active. For Baxter\nthis was an intolerable circumscription of God\u2019s omnipotence on\nthe mere whim of an all too fallible thinker. In a letter to More\nwritten in 1681, Baxter said,\n\nI confess I am too dull to be sure that God cannot endue matter itself\nwith the formal virtue of Perception\u2026 That Almighty God cannot\nmake perceptive living matter\u2026 I cannot prove, or I think you:\nWhere is the contradiction that makes it impossible? (Baxter 1682,\n28\u20139)\n\n\nAs Baxter made clear, he was unimpressed by More\u2019s claim that\nGlisson\u2019s view might lead to a denial of the existence of God\nand the immortality of the soul. For Baxter, More\u2019s claim that\n\u201cGod cannot do this\u201d was just as likely to lead to atheism\n(Baxter 1682, 29).\n\nMore published Baxter\u2019s letter and his reply to it, An\nAnswer to a Letter of a Learned Psychopyrist, in his edition of\nJoseph Glanvill\u2019s Saducismus Triumphatus of 1682.\nGlanvill, one of More\u2019s most devoted followers, had died before\nhe could produce his response to the anti-witchcraft treatise of John\nWebster (1611\u20131682), The Displaying of Supposed\nWitchcraft (1677), which had attacked Glanvill\u2019s earlier\nbooks on the reality of witchcraft (Crocker 2003). But\nGlanvill\u2019s books on witchcraft were largely intended as\ncontributions to More\u2019s own long standing campaign for proving\nthe existence of a spiritual realm by anecdotal evidence, and so More\nsaw the work through the press. He took the opportunity, however, to\nadd his own most recent attempts to impress his theories on the\nreading public, including his response to Baxter, an English\ntranslation of two chapters from the Enchiridion metaphysicum\n(chapters 27 and 28) which defined the nature of spirit, and yet more\nstories of witchcraft and apparitions which More himself had\ncollected.\n\nMore published another work of Glanvill\u2019s at this time, his\nLux orientalis, a survey of early views on the pre-existence\nof souls, again intended by Glanvill as a contribution to More\u2019s\nown religious campaign. This was published together with George\nRust\u2019s Discourse of Truth in a work which More\nentitled, Two Choice and Useful Treatises (1682). Rust had\nbeen a student of More\u2019s in the 1650s and had remained a devoted\nfollower while developing his own Origenian theology. More\u2019s\nannotations to Rust\u2019s Discourse included a lengthy\nreply to Baxter\u2019s response to An Answer to a\u2026 Learned\nPsychopyrist (Henry 1987, Hengstermann 2017).\n\nThe short pieces in these two collections represent More\u2019s final\ncontributions to philosophical theology. Otherwise his final years\nwere devoted to works on the interpretation of the prophetic books of\nthe Bible.\n",
