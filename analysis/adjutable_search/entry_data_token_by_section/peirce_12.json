    "main_text": "Logic\n13. Logic\n\n\nIn the extensiveness and originality of his contributions to\nmathematical logic, Peirce is almost without equal. His writings and\noriginal ideas are so numerous that there is no way to do them justice\nin a small article such as the present one. Accordingly, only a few of\nhis numerous achievements will be mentioned here.\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s special strength lay not so much in theorem-proving as rather\nin the invention and developmental elaboration of novel systems of\nlogical syntax and fundamental logical concepts. He invented dozens of\ndifferent systems of logical syntax, including a syntax based on a\ngeneralization of de Morgan\u2019s relative product operation, an algebraic\nsyntax that mirrored Boolean algebra to some extent, a\nquantifier-and-variable syntax that (except for its specific symbols)\nis identical to the much later Russell-Whitehead syntax. He even\ninvented two systems of graphical two-dimensional syntax. The first,\nthe so-called \u201centitative graphs,\u201d is based on disjunction\nand negation. A version of the entitative graphs later appeared in\nG. Spencer Brown\u2019s Laws of Form, without anything remotely\nlike proper citation of Peirce. A second, and better, system of\ngraphical two-dimensional syntax followed: the so-called\n\u201cexistential graphs.\u201d This system is based on conjunction\nand negation. Even though the syntax is two dimensional, the surface\nit actually requires in its most general form is a torus of finite\ngenus. So, the system of existential graphs actually requires three\ndimensions for its representations, although the third dimension in\nwhich the torus is embedded can usually be represented in two\ndimensions by the use of pictorial devices that Peirce called\n\u201cfornices\u201d or \u201ctunnel-bridges\u201d and by the use\nof identificational devices that Peirce called\n\u201cselectives.\u201d The existential graphs are essentially a\nsyntax for logic that uses the whole mathematical apparatus of\ntopological graph theory. There are three parts of it: alpha (for\npropositional logic), beta (for quantificational logic with identity\nbut without functions), and gamma (for modal logic and\nmeta-logic).\n\n\nIn 1873 Peirce published a long paper (completed in 1870)\n\u201cDescription of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives\u201d in\nwhich he introduced (six years before Frege\u2019s \nBegriffsschrift was published) a complete syntax for the\nlogic of relations of arbitrary adicity (or: arity). In this paper the\nnotion of the variable (though not under the name\n\u201cvariable\u201d) was invented, and Peirce provided devices for\nnegating, for combining relations (basically by building upon de\nMorgan\u2019s relative product and relative sum), and for quantifying\nexistentially and universally.  By 1883, along with his student\nO. H. Mitchell, Peirce had developed a full syntax for\nquantificational logic that was only a very little different (as was\nmentioned just above) from the standard Russell-Whitehead syntax,\nwhich did not appear until 1910 (with no adequate citations of\nPeirce).\n\n\nPeirce introduced the material-conditional operator into logic,\ndeveloped the Sheffer stroke and dagger operators 40 years before\nSheffer, and developed a full logical system based only on the stroke\nfunction. As Garret Birkhoff notes in his Lattice Theory it\nwas in fact Peirce who invented the concept of a lattice (around\n1883).  (Quite possibly, it is Peirce\u2019s lattice theory that holds the\nkey to his technical theory of infinitesimals and the continuum.)\n\n\nDuring his years teaching at Johns Hopkins University, Peirce began to\nresearch the four-color map conjecture, to work on the graphical\nmathematics of de Morgan\u2019s associate A. B. Kempe, and to develop\nextensive connections between logic. algebra, and topology, especially\ntopological graph theory. Ultimately these researches bore fruit in\nhis existential graphs, but his writings in this area also contain a\nconsiderable number of other valuable ideas and results. He hinted\nthat he had made great progress in the theory of provability and\nunprovability by exploring the connections between logic and\ntopology.\n",
