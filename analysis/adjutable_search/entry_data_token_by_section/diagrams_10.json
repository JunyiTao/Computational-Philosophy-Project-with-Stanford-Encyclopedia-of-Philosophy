Diagrammatic Systems in Geometry\n\nMathematicians have used, and continue to use, diagrams extensively.\nThe communication of mathematical concepts and proofs\u2014in\ntextbooks, on blackboards\u2014is not uniformly sentential. Figures\nand pictures are common. In line with the prevailing conception of\nlogic as essentially sentential, however, they are not usually thought\nto play a role in rigorous mathematical reasoning. Their use is taken\nto be limited to enhancing comprehension of a proof. They are not\nstandardly believed to form any part of the proof itself. \n\nThe attitude is well illustrated by the standard assessment of\nEuclid\u2019s methodology in the Elements. In no\nmathematical subject are diagrams more prominent than in the\nelementary geometry Euclid develops in the text. The proofs of the\nsubject seem to be in some sense about the diagrams of triangles and\ncircles that appear with them. This is especially the case with the\ngeometric proofs of the Elements. Diagrams for Euclid are not\nmerely illustrative. Some of his inference steps depend on an\nappropriately constructed diagram. On the standard story, these steps\nindicate gaps in Euclid\u2019s proofs. They show how Euclid did not\nfully carry out the project of developing geometry axiomatically.\n\nKen Manders set out to explode this story with his seminal work\n\u201cThe Euclidean diagram\u201d\n (2008 [1995]).\n His analysis of Euclid\u2019s diagrammatic proof method reveals that\nEuclid employs diagrams in a controlled, systematic way. It thus calls\ninto question the common, negative assessment of the rigor of the\nElements. Moreover, the specifics of Manders\u2019 analysis\nsuggest that the proofs of the text can be understood to adhere to a\nformal diagrammatic logic. This was subsequently confirmed by the\ndevelopment of formal diagrammatic systems designed to characterize\nsuch a logic. The first of these was FG (presented in\nMiller\n 2007),\n followed by the system Eu (Mumma\n 2010).\n\nThis section is devoted to explicating Manders\u2019 analysis and the\nformal systems that have emerged from it. After a brief survey of how\nEuclid\u2019s diagrams have been viewed through the centuries,\nManders\u2019 picture of their role in geometric proofs is presented.\nA description of how the systems FG and\nEu render this picture in formal terms and\ncharacterize a logic of Euclidean diagrams then follows.\n",
