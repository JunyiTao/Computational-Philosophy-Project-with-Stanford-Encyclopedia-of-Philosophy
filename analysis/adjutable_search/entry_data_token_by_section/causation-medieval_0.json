Causality and Motion\n\n\nThe term \u2018motion\u2019, in Aristotelian philosophy, can stand\nfor a wide range of changes of state, and not simply changes of place\n(the latter is usually known as local motion). Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics is basically an exhaustive study of motion in this\nvery wide sense. In this section, we will first deal with motion in general,\nand then with local motion. \n",
