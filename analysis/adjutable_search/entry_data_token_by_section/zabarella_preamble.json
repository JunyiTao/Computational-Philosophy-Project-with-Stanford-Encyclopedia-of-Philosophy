    "main_text": "\n\n\nGiacomo (Jacopo) Zabarella (b. 1533 in Padua, d. 1589 in Padua) is\nconsidered the prime representative of Renaissance Italian\nAristotelianism. Known most of all for his writings on logic and\nmethodology, Zabarella was an alumnus of the University of Padua,\nwhere he received his Ph.D. in philosophy. Throughout his teaching\ncareer at his native university, he also taught philosophy of nature\nand science of the soul (De anima). Among his main works are\nthe collected logical works Opera logica (1578) and writings\non natural philosophy, De rebus naturalibus (1590). Zabarella\nwas an orthodox Aristotelian seeking to defend the scientific status\nof theoretical natural philosophy against the pressures emanating from\nthe practical disciplines, i.e., the art of medicine and anatomy. He\ndeveloped the regressus method, which the Renaissance\nAristotelians regarded as the proper method for obtaining knowledge in\nthe theoretical sciences. At the turn of the seventeenth century\nZabarella\u2019s writings were reprinted in Germany, where his\nphilosophy had a notable following, especially among Protestant\nAristotelian authors.\n",
