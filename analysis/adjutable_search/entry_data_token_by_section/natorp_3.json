    "main_text": "Thinking\n4. Thinking\n\nJust as \u201cexperience\u201d for the neo-Kantians is restricted to\n\u201cscientific experience\u201d, so too is \u201cthinking\u201d\nrestricted to \u201cscientific thinking;\u201d in fact, Natorp\nvirtually conflates experience and thinking. His view of science as\nthe progress (Gang) of method via hypotheses regulated by an\nideal of complete objective determination leaves the problem of what\nexactly these hypotheses do and how they do it: the problem of Marburg\n\u201clogic\u201d. As Cassirer points out, Natorp\u2019s conception\nof logic presses the traditional \u201canalytic\u201d doctrines of\nconcept, judgement, and syllogistic into the background in favor of\nthe \u201csynthetic\u201d logic of the genesis of mathematical and\nphysical\n objectivity.[24]\n Natorp\u2019s logic is therefore called \u201cgenetic;\u201d it\ntells how thinking lawfully generates or synthesizes the unities that\nare its objects of knowledge. As such however it amounts to an\nanalytic reconstruction of thinking\u2019s synthetic construction of\nits objects (Natorp 1887: 283). He writes:\n\nIt is true that thinking operates [schafft] (in the sciences)\nin accord with secure laws of synthesis, although to a large extent it\nis at the same time unconscious of these laws. [As science] its\ninterest is not primarily these laws, but rather the scientific\ncontent which is generated in virtue of them. Thinking is in each case\nfocused upon its particular object. An entirely new level of\nreflection is required to investigate, not the particular object, but\nthe laws in accordance with which this and any scientific object in\ngeneral first constitutes itself as an object. This new kind of\nreflection we call \u201clogic\u201d. (Natorp 1910c: 10\u201311)\n\n\nIn other words, the scientific hypotheses or laws (Ge-setze)\nby which science methodically, synthetically progresses are not\ntransparent to rationality qua scientific; instead, they must\nbe analogically retraced by a critical \u201clogic\u201d. This\nis because the scientist is, and should be, solely concerned with the\nlaws in accordance with which the phenomena (objectively, not\npsychologically conceived, see\n Section 2)\n may be coherently ordered, and thus objectively determined.\nScientific thinking is the \u201clegislating\u201d (hypothesizing)\nof these laws; logic\u2014philosophy\u2014lays bare the laws in\naccordance with which this legislation occurs: reason\u2019s\nconstitution as opposed to its statutes.\n\n\nFor Natorp, as for Kant, thinking is activity, doing: the technical\nterm is \u201cfunction\u201d. This word, however, is as ambiguous as\nit is central to the Marburg account of\n thinking.[25]\n Occasionally, \u201cfunction\u201d seems to mean something like\nsubjective, psychic act, and as such is excluded from epistemological\nconsideration (Natorp 1887: 266); usually, however, it signifies the\nspontaneity of thinking, not in psychological terms, but as the\nrational act of hypothetical legislation discussed earlier. In this\nsecond signification it is sometimes connected with\n\u201cfunction\u201d in the mathematical sense, or else mathematical\nfunctions are adduced as paradigmatic of the functional conception of\n thinking.[26]\n The standard sense of \u201cfunction\u201d for Natorp, then, is\nthat of an act or \u201coperation\u201d of thinking, where this\nmeans laying down a hypothesis. Since the hypothesis is always a\nconcept, a generality that imposes a unity upon a phenomenal manifold,\nwe can understand \u201cfunction\u201d more precisely as the act of\nunification or synthesis. \n\nFor Kant, too, the term, \u201cfunction\u201d, is always connected\nto the categories\u2019 spontaneity and their synthetic activity;\nfurther, he holds that true cognition (Erkenntnis)\ncan only occur if the synthesis in question \u201cschematizes\u201d\nrepresentations given in intuition (cf. Young 1992; Friedman 1992,\n2000). By contrast, Natorp understands all concepts as\nfunctional, i.e., as categorial, since all of them, including the\nconcepts of space and time, are thought-operations serving to unify a\n manifold.[27]\n As we saw above, Natorp rejects any notion of intuition as a passive\nfaculty receptive of a given sensible manifold (cf. Natorp 1912c:\n201). Instead, he interprets intuition as itself an act of synthesis,\ni.e., as a generation of unity. He argues that a critical account of\nknowledge is not justified in presupposing some object conceived as\nexisting radically independent of mind, and which then somehow affects\nit via intuition: to do so would be tantamount to an intolerable\n\u201cmetaphysicism\u201d (Natorp 1912c: 202). Rather, Natorp claims\nto find in the first Critique itself the basis for his view\nthat intuition is not a factor \u201calien to thought\n[denkfremd]\u201d, but that it merely signifies a different\naspect of thinking, viz. that aspect in which a fully\nspatio-temporally determined object, rather than merely a law, is\nthought (Natorp 1912c: 204; Natorp 1910c: 2\u20133). This\n\u201cfulfillment [Vollzug]\u201d of objective thought \n\n\nin each of its stages requires rigorously unambiguous determination,\nbut determination always with respect to the lawful functions of\nthinking itself: determination of the particular, of quantity, of\nquality, in accord with the relation of causality and its laws.\n(Natorp 1912c: 204; Natorp 1887: 280) \n\n\nOn this view, far from being separate from and opposed to thinking as\nthey seem to be in the first Critique, space and time, as the\nforms of intuition, are originary thought-acts that make possible the\ndetermination of any object whatsoever. They are hypothesized,\nsynthetic manifolds, or\u2014more precisely\u2014unified, ordered\nmanifolds of points or \u201cpositions\u201d (Stellen) into\nwhich any object must first be integrated if it is to undergo any\nfurther determination as to quantity, quality, etc. (Natorp 1912c:\n203; 1887: 280. Cf. esp. 1911e: 76\u201377; PI, 159, ff;\n366, ff.). Thus, only in virtue of these various synthetic procedures\nof progressive determination, which Natorp calls\n\u201cobjectivation\u201d (i.e., object-formation), can a phenomenon\neven appear. But how does it appear? Since intuition and thinking are\nbeing analyzed here entirely at the \u201cfunctional\u201d level,\nthe phenomenon evidently does not appear as a sensible\nobject, i.e., one that may be assigned a unique set of spatio-temporal\nloci, and that then may serve as a carrier (Tr\u00e4ger) of\nall further determinations of quality, quantity, or relation.\n\nThis then raises the following pressing question: if, as he argues,\nintuition is itself a synthetic activity, what \u201cmatter\u201d\ndoes it synthesize, if not the sensible manifold? Natorp is\ndistressingly elusive on this point, even in his explicit discussions\nof the status of time and space in science (cf. Natorp 1910c: Chapter\n7). The following is clear, however. Like Kant, Natorp understands\nthinking always to be thinking an object. For Natorp, however, this\nmeans \u201cconstituting\u201d, \u201cconstructing\u201d, or\n\u201cobjectivating\u201d the object. But since he (re)interprets\nthese objects as non-sensible phenomena, he also interprets space and\ntime non-psychologically, i.e., as non-sensible. They are not the\nforms of sensible intuition, but the ideal system of dimensions (three\nspatial dimensions plus time (cf. Natorp 1910c: 303, ff.;\n397\u2013398), conceived as \n\n\nstructures of a purely mathematical kind, which nonetheless go beyond\nmere number, in virtue of the general relation to existence [that is]\ncontained in their very concepts. (Natorp 1910c:\n 341)[28]\n\n\n\nThus a very crucial distinction must be made between two levels of\nphenomenality and of objectivity, which for the purposes of this\narticle shall be called \u201cfirst-order\u201d and\n\u201csecond-order\u201d (cf. Stolzenberg 1995: 25). A first-order\nphenomenon is the psychic, subjective appearance that Natorp\ntacitly acknowledge has a basis in sensibility, and which he calls the\n\u201cPh\u00e4nomen letzter Instanz\u201d or the\n\u201cphenomenon of final authority\u201d (Natorp 1887: 273, 274;\n1913b:\n 192);[29]\n this first-order phenomenon is a \u201cVorstellung\u201d,\nor \u201crepresentation\u201d, i.e., a doxic phenomenon (Natorp\n1887: 266, 267; esp. 273). Hence it cannot be the referent of\nknowledge or science, since science does not concern itself with doxic\nappearances as such, but the objects (or\nobjectivities) which appear in or through the appearances (Natorp\n1913b: 193). \n\nBut how are we to understand this \u201cappearing\u201d of an object\n\u201cthrough\u201d the doxic appearances? What, precisely, is the\nrelation between the first-order and second-order\n\u201cphenomena\u201d? In the places where he explicitly mentions\nsensibility in the concrete, psychological sense (Natorp 1913b: 193),\nNatorp conceives it as never conveying or \u201cgiving\u201d the\nmind an object, ready-made. Rather, \u201cwhat\u201d sensibility\ngives is so entirely indeterminate and uncoordinated that it cannot\neven be called a manifold; whatever the chaos of sensibility may be,\nNatorp conceives it as nothing more than a task\n(Aufgabe), problem, or demand\n(Forderung) for objectivity, that is,\n objectivation.[30]\n Since no thing (no object) is ever given in sensibility, any object\nis only ever constructed, and can only be known qua\nconstruction, viz. as an instance of its constituting law. \n\nNatorp likens this problematic relation of first-order phenomenality\nand second-order objectivity to solving for X in an equation\n(Natorp 1887: 258, 262). If the solution(-set) of X is the\nobject for which thinking is to solve, then the sensible appearance is\nanalogous to the notational cipher, \u201cX\u201d, itself,\nsince what-has-not-yet-been-experienced is simply\nwhat-has-not-yet-been-constructed. Moreover, just as in solving an\nequation one can only determine the X in light of other known\nquantities assumed in the equation, one must in the same way establish\nthe determinations of the problematic object in light of other\nobjectivities (laws) that are assumed (ge-setzt). No such\nobjectivities are ever granted absolutely, of course, but only\nrelatively, namely with respect to the particular problem. They, too,\nare always susceptible to becoming problems in their turn. Therefore\nno complete solution\u2014no total determination of the\nobject\u2014can be achieved for any X, except\nasymptotically. While the fully determinate object itself thus remains\na forever unreachable focus imaginarius (see\n Section 3),\n it is, by the same token, always at least partially determined. And\nit is this partially determined objectivity as itself a\n(non-sensible) object of thinking that Natorp considers the\nsecond-order phenomenon, even though he will usually just call it a\n\u201cphenomenon\u201d, simpliciter. This\nscientific phenomenon, as an objectivity that is\nprogressively constituted by a dialectic between hypothesis and\ncalculation, entirely loses any sense of \u201cappearance\u201d.\nThis reconception of the phenomenon of mathematical physics finds an\nanalogue in geometry\u2019s replacement of constructions \u201cin\nintuition\u201d by purely logical deductions from Grundlagen\n(or \u201cfunctions\u201d in the sense of \u201chypothetical\nact\u201d) as epitomized by Hilbert\u2019s Grundlagen der\nGeometrie (cf. Friedman 1992, Chapter 1; Hilbert 1999), a book\ncited with approval by Natorp (1910c: 4) and Cassirer (2000: 99, f.).\n\n\nThe question now is: what makes the second-order phenomenon a bona\nfide objectivity, in contrast to the first-order phenomenon? Whereas\nthe first-order phenomena constitute private, lived subjectivity, not\nopen to prediction or even adequate description, Natorp\u2019s answer\nis that the second-order object is constructed in accordance with laws\nof thinking, which as laws are in their very nature objective, i.e.,\nuniversally valid for any thinker. Therefore objects\n(Gegenst\u00e4nde) lawfully determined will in principle be\nrationally transparent to any other thinker, i.e.,\n\u201cobjective\u201d (objektiv,\ngegenst\u00e4ndlich). Any such lawful objectivation or\nobject-formation just is knowledge or science, in the sense of being\nobjectively thinkable. These laws of constitution are in turn\nhierarchically arranged: the highest, most general laws are those\ngoverning all possible thinking, and thus the generation of all\nexperience. These are followed by mathematics, and by all the\nmathematically \u201cexact\u201d sciences. As was shown in\n Section 3,\n Natorp conceives these laws (Ge-setze) as\nessentially \u201chypothetical\u201d, that is, as\ncategorial posits. With the apparent exception of the basic logical\nlaws (e.g., the indispensable \u201claw of laws\u201d), all\nsuch laws are in principle revisable (which is chiefly why the\ndetermination of objectivities must be conceived as asymptotic)\n(Natorp 1887: 274; 276\u2013277).\n\nHence, philosophy, as transcendental critique (see\n Section 1),\n is \u201csharply distinguished from any kind of\n\u2018psychologism\u2019\u201d and \u201cmaintains its rigorously\nobjective character\u201d (Natorp 1912c:\n 198).[31]\n Why? Because its point of departure is the objective\n\u201cformations\u201d [Gestaltungen] of human culture,\nas objectivities, not as products of subjective psychological\noperations (Natorp 1912c: 198). In other words, philosophy always\nbegins from the second-order phenomena.\n",
