This deity-world emergence is akin to mind-body emergence.\nIn the following passage, Alexander explains that we should not\nidentity God with spacetime. Instead, the spacetime system is in the\nprocess of \u201cengendering\u201d God:\n\n\nThe universe, though it can be expressed without remainder in terms of\nSpace and Time, is not merely spatio-temporal. It exhibits materiality\nand life and mind. It compels us to forecast the next empirical\nquality of deity. On the one hand, we have the totality of the world,\nwhich in the end is spatio-temporal; on the other the quality of deity\nengendered or rather being engendered, within that whole. These two\nfeatures are united in the conception of the whole world as expressing\nitself in the character of deity, and it is this and not bare\nSpace-Time which for speculation is the ideal conception of God.\n(Alexander 1920ii: 353\u20134)\n\n\nFor Alexander, God is the whole world possessing the quality of deity\n(Alexander 1920ii: 353). However, the \u201cwhole world\u201d does\nnot yet exist because Alexander\u2019s universe is one of process;\nthe universe is in progress towards becoming complete, and this is why\nAlexander claims the universe is in process towards deity. The whole\nworld, which will possess the quality of deity, does not yet exist,\nbut part of it does: \u201cAs an actual existent, God is the infinite\nworld with its nisus towards deity\u201d (Alexander 1920ii: 353). The\nquality of deity has not yet arrived\u2014and indeed, may never\narrive\u2014but God exists in the sense that part of his body, the\ngrowing world, does.\n\nA potential problem for Alexander is that God is frequently perceived\nas being atemporal. In contrast, on Alexander\u2019s system, God is\nboth spatial and temporal. Alexander recognises that this could be\nconsidered a problem, but argues that in fact it is an advantage. If\nGod does not \u201cprecede\u201d the world, but rather is the\nproduct of it, you can avoid one formulation of the problem of\nevil, on which God creates the world and allows suffering within it\n(Alexander 1920ii: 399).\n\n\nGod is then not responsible for the miseries endured in working out\nhis providence, but rather we are responsible for our acts. (Alexander\n1920ii: 400)\n\n\nA created deity makes our positions as free agents more important.\n\nAlexander\u2019s account of deity is explored further in his 1927\n\u201cTheism and Pantheism\u201d, reprinted in his\nPhilosophical and Literary Pieces (1939). This paper argues\nthat theology is a kind of science aiming to account for a\ncertain kind of experience: one\u2019s sense of the divine in the\nworld (Alexander 1939: 316). Alexander discusses a particular\nphilosophical problem facing theism, the question of whether\ntranscendence (i.e., being beyond the material world) and immanence\n(i.e., living within the world) can be combined in one being, as is\noften claimed of God. Alexander argues he can offer a solution: God\ncan be understood as being transcendent and immanent if he will emerge\nfrom the world:\n\n\nGod\u2026 is himself in the making, and his divine quality or deity\na stage in time beyond the human quality. And as the root and leaves\nand sap of the plant feed its flower, so the whole world, as so far\nunrolled in the process of time, flowers into deity\u2026\nGod\u2019s deity is thus the new quality of the universe which\nemerges in its forward movement in time. (Alexander 1939: 330)\n\n\nGod is transcendent in the sense that he is still in the making, and\nimmanent in the sense that he will bloom from the whole world.\n\nExtended discussions of Alexander\u2019s theism can be found in Titus\n(1933) and Thomas (2016). Brief discussions can be found in\nMcCarthy (1948) and Stiernotte (1954). Emergentist\ntheologies, holding that in some sense God will emerge\nfrom the universe, are currently enjoying a revival, and in this\ncontext Clayton (2004) discusses Alexander\u2019s system as a rival\nto his own.\n",
