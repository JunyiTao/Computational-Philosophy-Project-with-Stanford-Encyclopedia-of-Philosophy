    "main_text": "The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms || The Principle of Democracy\n4.3 The Principle of Democracy\n\nThe keystone of Habermas\u2019s political theory is the principle of\ndemocracy that states:\n\n\nOnly those statutes may claim legitimacy that can meet with the assent\nof all citizens in a discursive process of legislation that in turn\nhas been legally constituted. (1992b [1996b: 110])\n\n\nIt also takes the form of a validity to consensus conditional, though\ndemocratic discourse is inclusive of ethical, moral, and pragmatic\nreasons, and indeed fair compromises, so that consensus is a messy and\nimperfect affair. This makes the process of reaching discursive\nagreement far more difficult, when one considers that many deeply held\nethical values are limited to particular cultural communities, though\nthis difficulty is supposed to be mitigated by the mediation of the\nlegislative process.\n\nA central contention of Between Facts and Norms is that what\nHabermas calls the principle of democracy \u201cderives\u201d from\nthe interpenetration of principle (D) and the legal form (1992b\n[1996b: 122\u20133]). Recall that in phase two principle (D) is\nsupposed to be a rule of practical argumentation in general that is\nneutral with respect to morality and law (1992b [1996b: 107]). In this\nrespect, Habermas claims, as in respect of the circular process of\nreciprocal co-original constitution, the principle of democracy is\n\u201cmorally freestanding\u201d (1992b [1996b: 80]). That is, the\nprinciple of democracy is derived completely independently of the\nmoral principle (Finlayson 2019: 94). Here again Habermas insists on\nthe autonomy of the democratic political process, and claims that the\ndemocratic procedure of the production of law is the sole source of\nits legitimacy, and he criticizes the views of Rawls, Dworkin,\nLarmore, and Apel, all of whom, in various different ways, claim that\nthe legitimacy (or validity) of law is borrowed from that of\nmorality.\n\nOne difficulty facing Habermas is to square his claims that (a)\ndemocratic discourse is an amalgam of all three kinds of discourse,\nand (b) that political legitimacy is sui generis and both\nethically and \u201cmorally freestanding\u201d, with (c) the\nabsolute priority of morality in all spheres. He claims that\nlegitimate laws \u201cmust harmonize with the universal principles of\njustice\u201d (1992b [1996b: 99, 155]) and that legitimate laws must\nnot \u201ccontradict basic moral principles\u201d (1992b [1996b:\n106]), by which he means valid moral norms. He places a moral\npermissibility constraint on political legitimacy, in such a way that\nit appears that morality constrains political legitimacy from the\noutside (Finlayson 2016). Habermas does not, though, see this as an\n\u201cexternal\u201d constraint, since he argues that morality flows\ninto the political and legal domain through the constitutional role of\nbasic rights, and circulates within it. Nevertheless, the moral\npermissibility constraint smudges the bright line that Habermas likes\nto draw between what he calls natural law theories of legitimacy,\nwhich are based on an antecedent morality, and discourse theory, which\nis not.\n",
