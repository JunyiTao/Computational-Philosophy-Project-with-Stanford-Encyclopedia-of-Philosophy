    "main_text": "What is Biodiversity? || Eliminating Biodiversity\n1.3 Eliminating Biodiversity\n\nRecently philosopher Carlos Santana has argued that we should\neliminate the concept of biodiversity from conservation biology\n(Santana 2014). He writes,\n\n\nBiodiversity is generally the assumed target of conservation biology,\nbut the biological world is composed of a number of distinct types of\ndiversity, which only loosely correlate with each other and with\nbiological value. Since the function of the biodiversity concept in\nconservation science is to help us preserve or increase biological\nvalue, we should therefore consider eliminating biodiversity from its\nprivileged position in conservation theory and practice. (Santana\n2014: 778)\n\n\nAs we have seen, we begin with a notion of biodiversity which can be\nestimated by a true surrogate but which actually is empirically\ntracked through a estimator surrogate. However, Santana points out\nthat we are concerned with biodiversity because of the\n\u201cbiological values\u201d associated with it. This leads to two\nsequences (Santana 2014: 765):\n\n\n\nestimator surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\) true surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nbiodiversity \\(\\rightarrow\\) biological value\n\n\nestimator surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\) true surrogate \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nbiological value\n\n\nSantana contends that (2) is preferable to (1). Why does he think\nthis? He argues that both Maclaurin and Sterelny\u2019s and\nSarkar\u2019s respective attempts at defining\n\u2018biodiversity\u2019 fail. Moreover, since according to Santana,\nusing the concept in conservation biology does more harm than good, we\nshould eliminate its use.\n\nFirst, Santana argues that there are many different sorts of diversity\nof biological value that cannot be subsumed by any single true\nsurrogate like species richness (Santana 2014: 768\u20139). For\nexample, we often wish to conserve biomes such as old growth forests\nor coral reefs independent of their composition of species. Or, we\nmight want to conserve distinct salmonoid populations even if they are\nof the same species. Second, assuming that there is a single or small\nnumber of true surrogates, such as species richness, ignores the fact\nthat not all species are of equal biological value. A species of\npollinator or top predator like the grey wolf is of greater than value\nthan some species of minnow. Additionally, there are values that are\nonly tendentiously connected to species richness like\n\u201cwildness\u201d or aesthetic value. Third, some species are of\ngreat disvalue. For example, many would argue that taxa like Ebola\nwould be better extinguished. If this is correct, Santana contends\nthat there is no single true surrogate through which biodiversity can\nbe articulated. We must eliminate the notion of biodiversity.\n\nThe second part of Santana\u2019s argument is this pluralism is\nunproblematic only if there is some true surrogate that covaries with\nthe other surrogates and hence biological value (Santana 2014:\n768\u201373). However, he complains that the available evidence\nsuggests this is false. If we augment species richness with abundance\nwe will not capture certain biological values since, for example, the\nrarity of a bird species increases its value and does not reduce it.\nPhenotypic variation requires the sort of morphospaces discussed\nabove, but these as we saw are local and cannot be compared across\nvery different taxa. Hence, even if we augment species richness with\nphenotypic variation we are unable to determine the biodiversity\npresent in comparable ways. Likewise, evolutionary diversity of the\nsort that Faith described does not necessarily correlate with species\nrichness. In one study of the South Africa\u2019s cape region, it was\ndetermined that the eastern region of the cape had greater\nevolutionary diversity as measured by the number of speciation events\nbetween clades whilst the western region of the cape had greater\nspecies richness (Mooers 2007). Speciation events are often\nunrecoverable from the fossil record and so this sort of diversity\ncannot typically augment species richness. Lastly, as we noted above,\nthe connection between species richness and ecological properties like\nstability is extremely complicated and controversial. It has not been\nshow in a robust manner that greater species richness leads to greater\necosystem or food web stability.\n\nThus, there are many different types of diversity encoded in the sorts\nof true surrogates we would like to conserve and they do not\npositively correlate in straightforward ways. If this is right,\nSantana contends that the concept of biodiversity in effect is not\ntracking a feature of the biological world. At most it is a\nplaceholder for whatever conservation biologists choose to conserve.\nThe concept has certainly made its way into public discourse and one\nmight worry that this would be extremely disruptive if we removed it\nfrom conservation practice. However, Santana suggests we should not\ntry to decide what to conserve based on some elusive property of\nbiological systems, which really is just a disjunction of very\ndifferent diversities. Rather, the tools through which value conflicts\nare best articulated is from political science and economics (Colyvan,\nJustus, & Regan 2011; Frank & Sarkar 2010). Regardless of the\ntools used, Santana argues that we should bypass the concept of\nbiodiversity and consider the biological values that we share and\nevaluate true surrogates on those grounds.\n\nThe discipline of conservation biology has settled on biodiversity as\nits purported object of study. However, there is a serious debate over\nwhether biodiversity is some natural possibly multidimensional feature\nor whatever is arrived at through procedures proposed in designing\nconservation area networks. And, some even have argued that it should\nbe eliminated from scientific practice. It is possible by taking the\n\u2018logical\u2019 out of \u2018biological diversity\u2019 we\nhave a politically expedient term which is scientifically\nproblematic.\n",
