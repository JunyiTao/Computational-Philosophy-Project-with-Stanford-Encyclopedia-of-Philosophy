    "main_text": "Epistemology || Methodology\n3.1 Methodology\n\nReydon\u2019s identification of an epistemological turn in our\nunderstanding of kinds and categories leads to a new question about\nthe category \u201cartifact\u201d. Rather than only asking whether\nit carves the world at a joint, we can also ask: Is it serving our\nepistemic purposes well? A number of authors have argued that\n\u201cartifact\u201d is methodologically counterproductive. Dan\nSperber (2007, 136\u2013137) claims that it is not a useful\ncategory for the purposes of a naturalistic social science.\n\n\nI have tried to cast doubt on the idea that a theoretically useful\nnotion of artifact can be built around its usual prototypes:\nbracelets, jars, hammers, and other inert objects, or that it can be\ndefined in a more systematic way\u2026. There is no good reason why\na naturalistic social science should treat separately, or even give\npride of place to, cultural productions that are both more clearly\nintended for a purpose and more thoroughly designed by humans, that\nis, to prototypical artifacts. (Sperber 2007, 137)\n\n\nSperber\u2019s main argument for this conclusion, as we noted in\n Section 1,\n is based on the continuum problem. But Sperber also suggests that in\nfocusing on paradigmatic artifacts as the basis for our\ncategorization, we are allowing ourselves to be epistemologically\ndisadvantaged by \u201ca doubly obsolete industrial-age revival of a\nPaleolithic categorization\u201d (2007, 136). In the\nPaleolithic, before there were any domesticates other than dogs, the\n(few) technologies people used in their daily lives were\nparadigmatic artifacts\u2014stone tools, baskets, beads, and so on.\nSo, Sperber speculates, we evolved a psychological disposition to\nclassify things in accordance with the predominance of such artifacts.\nWe then retained this disposition right through the Neolithic\ntransition to agriculture 12,000 years ago, which made biological\nartifacts (as Sperber calls domesticates) proportionally the most\ncommon type of artifact in human experience until the Industrial\ntransition of only a couple of centuries ago. This is the first sense\nin which our \u201cartifact\u201d category is obsolete. Second,\nSperber argues, information technology has increasingly contributed to\nour environment artifacts that would have astonished Aristotle with\ntheir ability to act on their own, beyond any intention their creators\nmay have. Simultaneously, biotechnology has made impressing our\nintentions on our biological artifacts increasingly effective. These\ncountervailing trends further reduce the dominance of erstwhile\nparadigmatic artifacts in our lives. This is the second sense in which\nour \u201cartifact\u201d category is obsolete. In short, Sperber\nseems to suggest, if we cannot shake the Paleolithic urge to center\nthe \u201cartifact\u201d category on the paradigmatic bracelets and\njars, we should jettison the category altogether, for the sake of an\nepistemologically adequate social science.\n\nBeth Preston (2013, 4\u20137) declines to use the term\n\u201cartifact\u201d, opting instead for the more open-ended\n\u201cmaterial culture\u201d. The initial problem she identifies is\nthat phenomena of interest from the point of view of human interaction\nwith the environment do not divide naturally into interactions with\nartifacts and interactions with other sorts of things. We noted an\nexample of this in\n Section 1\u2014intentionally\n made paths, which do qualify as artifacts, are used in the same way\nas unintentionally made paths. It thus seems methodologically\nwrongheaded to rule the unintentionally made path out of consideration\non a definitional technicality. Similarly, residues such as sawdust,\nwhey, or fingerprints often enter into human practices in important\nways, but a focus on artifacts as traditionally defined may leave\nthese phenomena out of account as well. Preston also argues that it is\nprecisely the central concepts in a field of investigation that should\nbe left open-ended, on pain of epistemic distortion of the results.\nFor example, defining \u201cmind\u201d very strictly might have\nruled the extended mind debate out in advance.\n\nSteven Vogel (2003; 2015) argues that no good sense can be made\nof the artifact-nature distinction, making it unfit for the purposes\nof environmental philosophy. His argument unrolls against the backdrop\nof a longstanding controversy in environmental philosophy about the\nvalue of ecological restoration\u2014the practice of restoring areas\ndamaged by mining, industrial waste and the like to something as close\nas possible to the condition they were in before the damage was done.\nThe ontological status of such sites has been challenged on the\ngrounds that such restoration does not actually restore nature but\nrather creates an artifact (Katz 1997). Worse yet, this artifact is\npassed off as nature, so it is a fake (Elliot 1997). This casts doubt\non the ethical and political value of ecological restoration as an\nenvironmental practice. Vogel responds by questioning the unspoken\nassumption that environmental philosophy is about nature, and\nenvironmental activism about protecting nature from human activity. He\nargues that nature conceived as pristine and independent in this way\ndoes not exist\u2014certainly not now that human activity is global\nin its effects, as Bill McKibben (1989) noted long ago, but in\nprinciple, since humans, like all other living things, change their\nenvironment simply by living in it. On Vogel\u2019s view,\nenvironmental philosophy is about just that\u2014the environment,\nboth built and not-so-built, and what we should do to ensure that it\nis the environment we want and need, not only for ourselves but for\nother beings as well.\n\nThe important point for our purposes, though, is that Vogel\u2019s\npost-nature environmental philosophy rests on a full-throated\nrejection of the nature-artifact categorization. He begins with the\nclaim that our concepts of nature\u2014already multiple, and not\nalways carefully distinguished\u2014are riddled with\nantinomy-generating ambiguities. The epistemological backwash leaves\nus mired in nostalgia, unable to see and address environmental\nproblems as they actually exist. In particular, we are unable to see\nthat ecological restoration does not produce artifacts by the\ntraditional definition, since restored areas are designed precisely to\nescape our designs and outrun our intentions. They are thus\n\u201cwild\u201d in a perfectly straightforward sense. Furthermore,\nVogel argues, all human productions, including artifacts, are wild in\nthis sense. Rather than focusing on unintentional creations, as\nPreston and Sperber tend to do, Vogel emphasizes the ways in which\nartifacts outrun all our creative intentions.\n\n\nBuilding an artifact requires black boxes all the way down: to\ndesign and build anything requires presupposing a whole set of\nprocesses that one does not design, and whose operation beyond\none\u2019s understanding and intention is necessary for building to\ntake place. There is a gap, in the construction of every\nartifact, between the intention with which the builder acts and the\nconsequences of her acts, a gap that is ineliminable and indeed\nconstitutive of what it is to construct something, and in this gap\nresides something like what I earlier called wildness. (Vogel\n2015, 113)\n\n\nThus the traditional definition of\n\u201cartifact\u201d\u2014something intentionally made for a\npurpose\u2014while true as far as it goes, merely skates over the\nsurface, leaving us at an epistemological disadvantage with regard to\nthe full range and depth of the phenomena.\n",
