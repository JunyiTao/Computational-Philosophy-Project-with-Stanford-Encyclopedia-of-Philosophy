    "main_text": "Types, Degrees, and Relatives of Belief || Degree of Belief\n2.3 Degree of Belief\n\nJessie believes that Stalin was originally a Tsarist mole among the\nBolsheviks, that her son is at school, and that she is eating a\ntomato. She feels different degrees of confidence with respect to\nthese different propositions. The first she recognizes to be a\nspeculative historical conjecture; the second she takes for granted,\nthough she knows it could be false; the third she regards as a\nnear-certainty. Consequently, Jessie is more confident of the second\nproposition than the first and more confident of the third than the\nsecond. We might suppose that every subject holds each of their\nbeliefs with some particular degree of confidence. In general, the\ngreater the confidence one has in a proposition, the more willing one\nis to depend on it in one\u2019s actions.\n\nOne common way of formalizing this idea is by means of a scale from 0\nto 1, where 0 indicates absolute certainty in the falsity of a\nproposition, 1 indicates absolute certainty in its truth, and .5\nindicates that the subject regards the proposition just as likely to\nbe true as false. This number then indicates one\u2019s\ncredence or degree of belief. Standard approaches\nequate degree of belief with the maximum amount the subject would, or\nalternatively should, be willing to wager on a bet that pays nothing\nif the proposition is false and 1 unit if the proposition is true. So,\nfor example, if the subject thinks that the proposition \u201cthe\nrestaurant is open\u201d is three times more likely to be true than\nfalse, they should be willing to pay no more than $0.75 for a wager\nthat pays nothing if the restaurant is closed and $1 if it is open.\nConsequently, the subject\u2019s degree of belief is .75, or 75%.\nSuch a formalized approach to degree of belief has proven useful in\ndecision theory, game theory, and economics. Standard philosophical\ntreatments of this topic include Jeffrey (1983) and Skyrms (2000).\n\nHowever, the phrase \u201cdegree of belief\u201d may be misleading,\nbecause the relationship between confidence, betting behavior, and\nbelief is not straightforward. The dispositionalist or\ninterpretationist, for example, might regard exhibitions of confidence\nand attitudes toward risk as only part of the overall pattern\nunderwriting belief ascription. Similarly, the representationalist\nmight hold that readiness to deploy a representation in belief-like\nways need not line up perfectly with betting behavior. Some people\nalso find it intuitive to say that a rational person holding a ticket\nin a fair lottery may not actually believe that they will lose, but\ninstead regard it as an open question, despite having a \u201cdegree\nof belief\u201d of, say, .9999 that they will lose. If this person\ngenuinely believes some other propositions, such as that their son is\nat school, with a \u201cdegree of belief\u201d considerably less\nthan .9999, then it appears to follow that a rational person may in\nsome cases have a higher \u201cdegree of belief\u201d in a\nproposition that they do not believe than in a proposition they do\nbelieve (see Harman 1986; Sturgeon 2008; Buchak 2014; Leitgeb 2017;\nFriedman 2019). This suggests a dissociation between belief and\ncredence, raising the question of whether they are distinct attitudes,\nand if so whether one is more fundamental (see Jackson 2020 for a\nreview).\n\nRelatedly, Neil Van Leeuwen has argued for a functional distinction\nbetween \u201cfactual belief\u201d and \u201creligious\ncredence\u201d (Van Leeuwen 2014) or, alternatively,\n\u201cmundane\u201d and \u201cgroupish\u201d belief (Van Leeuwen\nforthcoming). The first type of belief guides mundane action and tends\nto do so successfully when the belief is true. Typical contents might\nbe: the light switch is to the left; class is at 2 p.m. The second\ntype of belief, in contrast, is connected with group identity and\nworks well if it effectively signals group membership, regardless of\ntruth. Typical contents might be: God is a Trinity; Earth is flat. If\nVan Leeuwen is correct, mundane and groupish beliefs are sufficiently\ndifferent in their causes and effects, or their functional roles, as\nto be worth distinguishing as distinct types of attitude.\n",
