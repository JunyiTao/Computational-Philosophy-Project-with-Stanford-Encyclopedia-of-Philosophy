But various things have been meant by\n\u201cexperience\u201d. On a narrow account,\n\u201cexperience\u201d refers to sense experience, that is, to\nexperiences that come from the use of our five senses: sight, touch,\nhearing, smell, and taste. However, this narrow account implies that\njustification based on introspection, proprioception (our kinesthetic\nsense of the position and movements of our body), memory, and\ntestimony are kinds of a priori justification. And if we had\ndifferent senses, like those of bats (echolocation) and duck-billed\nplatypuses (electrolocation), experiences based on those senses would\nprovide a priori, not empirical, justification on this\naccount which takes a priori justification to be independent\nof experiences based on the senses we have.\n\nGiven these considerations, perhaps \u201cexperience\u201d should be\ntaken to mean \u201csense experience of any sort, introspection,\nproprioception, memory, and testimony\u201d. This sounds like a\nhodgepodge of various sources of justification but perhaps what unites\nthem is that, leaving aside memory and testimony, these sources\nprovide us with information either about the physical world or our\ninner world, either the outer world through perception or the inner\nworld of what we are feeling or thinking, or information about our\nbodies, through introspection and proprioception. Memory and testimony\nare not primary sources of justification; their primary epistemic\nfunction is to transmit either a priori or empirical\njustification. So the proposal should be seen as a way of\ndistinguishing the primary sources of justification into two\ncategories of justification: a priori and empirical.\n\nAs noted above (see,\n sec. 3)\n and below\n (secs. 4.4 and 4.5),\n \u201cindependent of experience\u201d should not be taken to mean\nindependent of all experience, but, as a first approximation,\nto mean \u201cindependent of all experience beyond what is needed\nto grasp the relevant concepts involved in the\nproposition\u201d. It is sometimes said that a priori\njustification can depend on experience insofar as it enables\nthe person to acquire the concepts needed to grasp the meaning of the\nproposition which is the object of justification, but experience\ncannot play an evidential role in that justification\n(Williamson 2013: 293). Later we will see that the notion of enabling\nexperience might better be expanded to include experience needed to\nacquire certain intellectual skills such as those needed to construct\ncertain proofs or create counterexamples (see,\n secs. 4.4 and 4.5,\n below).\n\nSuppose there is a significant difference between a priori\nand empirical justification. This still does not tell us what the\nbasis of a priori justification is. One view is that rational\nintuitions or insights are the bases of a priori\njustification; experiences, as construed above, the bases of empirical\njustification. Before discussing the nature of rational intuitions or\ninsights, we should first distinguish between intuitions and\nintuitive judgments and consider what the content of\nintuitive judgments evoked in thought experiments is.\n",
