    "main_text": "\n\nSpeusippus of Athens was the son of Plato\u2019s sister Potone; he became\nhead of the Academy on Plato\u2019s death in 348/347 and remained its head\nfor eight years (Diogenes Laertius iv 1), apparently until his death.\nHis date of birth is harder to get a fix on; it has reasonably been\nestimated at ca. 410. He apparently wrote a lot: \u201ca great many\ntreatises and many dialogues\u201d (ibid. iv 4; Diogenes\nlists about 30 titles, and his bibliography is on his own admission\nincomplete). We have very little of what he wrote, if any (we have\nsomething from a work later attributed to him, On Pythagorean\nNumbers, discussed below, but this is not one of Diogenes\u2019\ntitles; and we may have something preserved in Iamblichus, De\ncommuni mathematica scientia iv, also discussed\nbelow).\n\nDiogenes tells us (iv 1) that Speusippus \u201cabided by the views of\nPlato\u201d; from what little we can tell, this is simply false. In\nparticular, Speusippus rejected the Theory of Forms.\n\nReferences will be to the primary sources; the two most recent\ncollections of the fragments (Isnardi Parente 1980, Tar\u00e1n 1981)\nhave indices that will enable the reader to locate the texts (Lang\n1911 does not). Citations from Plato and Aristotle are to any standard\nedition; those from other ancient authors are taken from texts listed\nin the bibliography (translations are in all cases my own, but where\nan alternative English translation is available, I have given a\nreference to it).\n\nWhat we can infer, mostly from Aristotle but with a few supplements\nfrom other authors, will be covered under three headings:\n",
