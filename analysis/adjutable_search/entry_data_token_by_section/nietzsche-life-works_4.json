    "main_text": "Final Writings of 1888\n5. Final Writings of 1888\n\nThe Case of Wagner, A Musician\u2019s Problem (Der Fall\nWagner, Ein Musikanten-Problem, May-August 1888), contrasts\nsharply with Nietzsche\u2019s laudatory portrayal of Wagner in\nThe Birth of Tragedy (1872), and compares well with his 1873\nmeditation on David Strauss in its unbridled attack on a popular\ncultural figure. In The Case of Wagner, Nietzsche\n\u201cdeclares war\u201d upon Richard Wagner, whose music is\ncharacterized as the epitome of modern cultural achievement, but also\ncrucially as sick and decadent. The work is a brilliant display of\nNietzsche\u2019s talents as a music critic, and includes memorable\nridicule of Wagner\u2019s theatrical style, reflections on redemption\nvia art, a \u201cphysiology of art,\u201d and discussion of the\nvirtues associated, respectively, with ascending and descending life\nenergies. As the therapeutic inversion and antithesis of\nWagner\u2019s debilitatingly serious music, Nietzsche refers us to\nGeorges Bizet (1838\u20131875) whose music he finds cheerful,\nrevitalizing, redeeming and light-hearted. Wagner himself had some\nyears earlier (1850) condemned Felix Mendelssohn (1809\u20131847) for\nhaving confounded the public\u2019s taste in music. Nietzsche,\nwriting almost thirty years later, here accuses Wagner of having done\nthe same.\n\nThe title, Twilight of the Idols, or How One Philosophizes with a\nHammer (G\u00f6tzen-D\u00e4mmerung, oder Wie man mit dem\nHammer philosophiert, August-September 1888), word-plays upon\nWagner\u2019s opera, The Twilight of the Gods (Die\nG\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung). Nietzsche reiterates and elaborates\nsome of the criticisms of Socrates, Plato, Kant and Christianity found\nin earlier works, criticizes the then-contemporary German culture as\nbeing unsophisticated and too-full of beer, and shoots some\ndisapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural\nfigures such as Rousseau, Hugo, Sand, Michelet, Zola, Renan, Carlyle,\nMill, Eliot, Darwin, and Dante. In contrast to these alleged\nrepresentatives of cultural decadence, Nietzsche applauds Caesar,\nNapoleon, Goethe, Dostoevsky, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier\nand stronger types. The phrase \u201cto philosophize with a\nhammer\u201d primarily signifies a way to test idols by tapping on\nthem lightly; one \u201csounds them out\u201d to determine whether\nthey are hollow, or intact, etc., as physician would use a percussion\nhammer upon the abdomen as a diagnostic instrument.\n\nIn The Antichrist, Curse on Christianity (Der Antichrist.\nFluch auf das Christentum, September 1888 [published 1895]),\nNietzsche expresses his disgust over the way noble values in Roman\nSociety were corrupted by the rise of Christianity, and he discusses\nspecific aspects and personages in Christian culture\u2014the\nGospels, Paul, the martyrs, priests, the crusades\u2014with a view\ntowards showing that Christianity is a religion for weak and unhealthy\npeople, whose general historical effect has been to undermine the\nhealthy qualities of the more noble cultures. The Antichrist\nwas initially conceived of as the first part of a projected four-part\nwork for which Nietzsche had in mind the title, Revaluation of All\nValues (the second part was to be entitled, \u201cThe Free\nSpirit\u201d). As in most of his 1888 works, Nietzsche criticizes,\neither implicitly or explicitly, the anti-Semitic writers of his day.\nIn this particular study, one of his main targets is the French,\nanti-Semitic, Christian historian, Ernest Renan (1823\u20131892), who\nwas known for works such as The Life of Jesus (1863) and\nHistory of the Origins of Christianity (1866\u20131881), the\nfourth book of which was entitled The Antichrist (1873). Some\ninterpret Nietzsche\u2019s title for his book as meaning, \u201cthe\nAntichristian.\u201d It should be noted that in an 1883 letter to his\nfriend, Peter Gast [Johann Heinrich K\u00f6selitz], Nietzsche does\ndescribe himself self-entertainingly as \u201cthe Antichrist,\u201d\nand also more seriously as \u201cthe most terrible opponent of\nChristianity.\u201d\n\nNietzsche describes himself as \u201ca follower of the philosopher\nDionysus\u201d in Ecce Homo, How One Becomes What One Is\n(Ecce Homo, Wie man wird, was man ist, October-November\n1888)\u2014a book in which he examines retrospectively his entire\ncorpus, work by work, offering critical remarks, details of how the\nworks were inspired, and explanatory observations regarding their\nphilosophical contents. He begins this fateful intellectual\nautobiography\u2014he was to lose his mind little more than a month\nlater\u2014with three eyebrow-raising sections entitled, \u201cWhy I\nAm So Wise,\u201d \u201cWhy I Am So Clever,\u201d and \u201cWhy I\nWrite Such Good Books.\u201d Nietzsche claims to be wise as a\nconsequence of his acute aesthetic sensitivity to nuances of health\nand sickness in people\u2019s attitudes and characters; he claims to\nbe clever because he knows how to choose the right nutrition, climate,\nresidence and recreation for himself; he claims to write such good\nbooks because they allegedly adventurously open up, at least for a\nvery select group of readers, a new series of noble and delicate\nexperiences. After examining each of his published works, Nietzsche\nconcludes Ecce Homo with the section, \u201cWhy I Am a\nDestiny.\u201d He claims that he is a destiny because he regards his\nanti-moral truths as having the annihilating power of intellectual\ndynamite; he expects them to topple the morality born of sickness\nwhich he perceives to have been reigning within Western culture for\nthe last two thousand years. In this way, he expresses his hope that\nDionysus, the god of life\u2019s exuberance, would replace Jesus, the\ngod of the heavenly otherworld, as the premier cultural standard for\nfuture millennia.\n\nAlthough Ecce Homo stands historically as Nietzsche\u2019s\nfinal autobiographical statement, if we consider that\u2014although\nthe plans were in flux\u2014Nietzsche was embarking on a new work, at\none point to be entitled, Revaluation of All Values, his 1888\nautobiographical excursion can be appreciated as a kind of\nhouse-cleaning and summing-up of where he had intellectually arrived\nat that point. Rather than being a final self-definition, it can be\nseen as yet another among Nietzsche\u2019s several efforts over the\nyears to clear the way for a freer intellectual development or\nmetamorphosis. In this respect, it compares to Thus Spoke\nZarathustra, Book IV, which appears to be Nietzsche\u2019s\nsquarely facing, almost as a kind of exorcism, the variety of inner\ncharacters that constituted his personality. Along the same lines,\nEcce Homo recalls the interval between\nHuman-All-too-Human and Daybreak, when Nietzsche\nplunged to a very low point in his health, coming close to death, and\nthen dramatically recuperated.\n\nNietzsche Contra Wagner, Out of the Files of a Psychologist\n(Nietzsche contra Wagner, Aktenst\u00fccke eines Psychologen,\nDecember 1888) is a short, but classic, selection of passages\nNietzsche extracted from his 1878\u20131887 published works. Many\nconcern Wagner, but the excerpts serve mostly as a foil for Nietzsche\nto express his own views against Wagner\u2019s. In this\nself-portrait, completed only a month before his collapse, Nietzsche\ncharacterizes his own anti-Christian sentiments, and contemplates how\neven the greatest people usually undergo significant corruption. In\nWagner\u2019s case, Nietzsche claims that the corrupting force was\nChristianity. One cannot help remembering here how, using the same\nkind of rationale, Wagner claimed that Felix Mendelssohn\u2019s\ncorrupting force was Judaism. At the same time, Nietzsche describes\nhow he truly admired some of Wagner\u2019s music for its profound\nexpressions of loneliness and suffering\u2014expressions which\nNietzsche admitted were psychologically impossible for he himself to\narticulate.\n\nThe writings of Nietzsche\u2019s final active year are peppered with\nsome wild phrasings, but they remain lucid and philosophically\npenetrating on the whole. Given the utter loss of Nietzsche\u2019s\nintellectual capacities upon his collapse, this prior lucidity is\npuzzling. The abruptness of his breakdown in combination with the\nlucidity of his final writings has fed speculation that rather than\nsuffering from a slowly progressive mental disease, Nietzsche had a\nphysical condition (e.g., a brain tumor) whose silent growth\neventually reached a critical mass that caused his mental composure to\nsnap.\n",
