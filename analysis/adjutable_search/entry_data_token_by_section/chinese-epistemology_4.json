    "main_text": "Specific Features || The Axiology of Comprehension\n2.2 The Axiology of Comprehension\n\nWhile in the most influential European theories, knowledge has mainly\nbeen gained through reasoning, traditional Chinese thought understood\nthis question in a much broader sense, namely as something which also\n(or primarily) stems from moral contents. Chinese epistemology also\nincluded teachings of wisdom and dealt with questions such as\n\u201chow is metaphysics (or metaphysical wisdom) possible?\u201d\nand \u201chow can an ideal personality be cultivated?\u201d Hence,\nChinese epistemology focuses upon the internal relationship between\ngood and truth, between virtue and reason; it needs morality to\nacquire knowledge, and regards epistemology and axiology as\noverlapping (Xu and Huang 2008: 42). Thus, traditional Chinese, and\nespecially traditional Confucian epistemology, greatly emphasizes the\nconcept of moral cultivation. Confucius believed that all genuine\nknowledge and comprehension arises from humaneness (ren\n\u4ec1), and thus morality should be valued to gain knowledge (Lunyu\nCTP: Li Ren, 2, 7). Classical Chinese epistemological\nteachings of cultivation and theories of values both dealt with\ncriteria and methods that evaluate proper attitudes, ways of thinking\nand feelings (Xu and Huang 2008: 39).\n\nIn contrast with the view that the human mind is defined merely by its\ncognitive potential and could thus not be autonomous, Mengzi\nintroduced the concept of a moral Self which is incorporated in the\noriginal heart-mind (ben xin \u672c\u5fc3, Mengzi CTP:\nGaozi shang, 10) i.e., the heart-mind of goodness and morality.\nThis presumption has been seen as utmost important and hence, exposed\nby several modern and contemporary Confucians. In his interpretation,\nXu Fuguan (1902/03\u20131982) noted that the moral Self\u2014at\nleast in terms of its basic characteristics\u2014was already present\nin the early Zhou Dynasty (10th century BC). When this moral\nconsciousness is seated within a person, it will\u2014according to\nthis Modern Confucian interpreter (Xu 2005: 178)\u2014naturally begin\nto direct his/her life and guide his/her desires through something\ns/he calls \u201cmoral reason\u201d (daode lixing\n\u9053\u5fb7\u7406\u6027). In this context, Lee Ming-huei\nexposes the importance of the Confucian humaneness (ren\n\u4ec1), which he mostly analyses in the context of its embeddedness\ninto the Mencian theory of inherent morality (renyi neizai\n\u4ec1\u7fa9\u5167\u5728), which is comparable to Kant\u2019s\napriorism (e.g. Lee 2018: 37\u20138).\n\nThis spirit was focused on subjectivity; its bodily desires were\nincorporated into its moral responsibility and they thus manifested\nthemselves in rationality and autonomy (Xu 2005: 34). Modern\ninterpretations also emphasize that this Mencian line of thought has\nlater been developed further and elaborated upon within the scope of\nNeo-Confucian philosophy, especially Wang Yangming\u2019s concept of\ninnate moral knowledge (liang zhi \u826f\u77e5).\n\nHowever, due to the specific economic and political factors that\ndetermined traditional Chinese culture, the traditional Chinese\nconcept of moral Self could not provide (or, at least, formulate) the\npossibilities for gaining \u201cobjective\u201d knowledge (i.e.,\nknowledge not necessarily linked to morality) and exploring\n\u201cnatural\u201d phenomena. For Mou Zongsan (1909\u20131995),\nthis was the key ideological factor that explained why traditional\nChinese culture did not develop discourses of science and democracy.\nHe therefore argued that the traditional Confucian moral Self should\n(temporarily) negate itself (ziwo kanxian\n\u81ea\u6211\u574e\u9677), in order to make it possible for\nthese discourses to develop.\n\nA similar critique of classical Confucian moral epistemology\nwas\u2014although from a different perspective\u2014formulated\nalready by his teacher Xiong Shili (1885\u20131968). Based on his\ncentral thesis dealing with the inseparability of substance and\nfunction (Ro\u0161ker 2009a: 377), Xiong created an ethical system\nrooted in the classical Confucian paradigm of the nobleman\n(junzi \u541b\u5b50), defined as someone who possesses\nthe qualities of the \u201cinner sage\u201d and the \u201couter\nruler.\u201d The concept of the inner sage refers to spiritual\nadjustment, while the concept of the outer ruler has to do with that\nperson\u2019s social and political activities. While this moral\ndirective, which was expressed in the ancient phrase nei sheng wai\nwang \u5167\u8056\u5916\u738b, was based on classical\nConfucian political studies, Xiong criticized classical Confucianism,\nespecially the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties,\nprecisely in this regard, accusing them that their epistemologies\nexaggeratedly emphasized the principle of inwardness and ignored the\nsocial aspects of the binary category.\n",
