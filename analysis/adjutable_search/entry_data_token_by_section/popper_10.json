    "main_text": "Immutable Laws and Contingent Trends\n11. Critical Evaluation\n\nWhile it cannot be said that Popper was modest, he took criticism of\nhis theories very seriously, and spent much of his time in his later\nyears in addressing them. The following is a summary of some of the\nmain ones which he had to address. (For Popper\u2019s responses to\ncritical commentary, see his \u201cReplies to My Critics\u201d\n(1974) and his Realism and the Aim of Science (1983).\n\nFirst, Popper claims to be a realist and rejects conventionalist and\ninstrumentalist accounts of science. But his account in the Logic\nof Scientific Discovery of the role played by basic statements in\nthe methodology of falsification seems to sit uneasily with that. As\nwe have seen, he follows Kant in rejecting the positivist/empiricist\nview that observation statements are incorrigible, and argues that\nthey are descriptions of what is observed as interpreted by the\nobserver with reference to a determinate conceptual and theoretical\nframework. He accordingly asserts that while basic statements may have\na causal relationship to experience, they are neither determined nor\njustified by it.\n\nHowever, this would seem to pose a difficulty: if a theory is to be\ngenuinely testable, it must be possible to determine, at least in\nprinciple, whether the basic statements which are its potential\nfalsifiers are actually true or false. But how can this be known, if\nbasic statements cannot be justified by experience? As we have seen,\nPopper\u2019s answer is that the acceptance or rejection of basic\nstatements depends upon a convention-based decision on the part of the\nscientific community.\n\n\nFrom a logical point of view, the testing of a theory depends upon\nbasic statements whose acceptance or rejection, in its turn, depends\nupon our decisions. Thus it is decisions which settle the fate of\ntheories. (2002: 91)\n\n\nTraditional conventionalism, as exemplified in the work of Mach,\nPoincar\u00e9 and Milhaud amongst others, holds that a\n\u201csuccessful\u201d science is one in which universal theories\nhave assumed such explanatory critical mass that a convention emerges\nto pre-empt the possibility of their empirical refutation. This is\nstrongly rejected by Popper, who differentiates his position from it\nby arguing that it is the acceptance of basic statements, rather than\nthat universal theory, which is determined by convention and\nintersubjective agreement. For him, the acceptance or rejection of\ntheory occurs only indirectly and at a higher investigative level,\nthrough critical tests made possible by the conventional acceptance of\nbasic statements. As he puts it, \u201cI differ from the\nconventionalist in holding that the statements decided by agreement\nare not universal but singular\u201d (2002: 92). Simultaneously,\nhowever, he rejects any suggestion that basic statements are\njustifiable by direct experience:\n\n\nI differ from the positivist in holding that basic statements are not\njustifiable by our immediate experiences, but are, from the logical\npoint of view, accepted by an act, by a free decision. (2002: 92)\n\n\nIt is thus evident that Popper saw his account of basic statements as\nsteering a course between the Scylla of orthodox conventionalism and\nthe Charybdis of positivism/empiricism. However, while it is both\ncoherent and consistent in that regard, there can be little doubt but\nthat it constitutes a form of conventionalism in its own right. And it\nis not clear that it is compatible with scientific realism, understood\nas the view that scientific theories give true or approximately true\ndescriptions of elements of a mind-independent world. As Lakatos puts\nit,\n\n\nIf a theory is falsified, it is proven false; if it is\n\u201cfalsified\u201d [in Popper\u2019s conventionalist sense], it\nmay still be true. If we follow up this sort of\n\u201cfalsification\u201d by the actual \u201celimination\u201d of\na theory, we may well end up by eliminating a true, and accepting a\nfalse, theory. (Lakatos 1978: 24)\n\n\nSecond, Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation hinges quite\nfundamentally on the assumption that there are such things as critical\ntests, which either falsify a theory, or give it a strong measure of\ncorroboration. Popper himself is fond of citing, as an example of such\na critical test, the resolution, by Adams and Leverrier, of the\nproblem which the anomalous orbit of Uranus posed for nineteenth\ncentury astronomers. They independently came to the conclusion that,\nassuming Newtonian mechanics to be precisely correct, the observed\ndivergence in the elliptical orbit of Uranus could be explained if the\nexistence of a seventh, as yet unobserved outer planet was posited.\nFurther, they were able, again within the framework of Newtonian\nmechanics, to calculate the precise position of the \u201cnew\u201d\nplanet. Thus when subsequent research by Galle at the Berlin\nobservatory revealed that such a planet (Neptune) did in fact exist,\nand was situated precisely where Adams and Leverrier had calculated,\nthis was hailed as by all and sundry as a magnificent triumph for\nNewtonian physics: in Popperian terms, Newton\u2019s theory had been\nsubjected to a critical test, and had passed with flying colours.\n\nYet Lakatos flatly denies that there are critical tests, in the\nPopperian sense, in science, and argues the point convincingly by\nturning the above example of an alleged critical test on its head.\nWhat, he asks, would have happened if Galle had not found the\nplanet Neptune? Would Newtonian physics have been abandoned, or would\nNewton\u2019s theory have been falsified? The answer is clearly not,\nfor Galle\u2019s failure could have been attributed to any number of\ncauses other than the falsity of Newtonian physics (e.g., the\ninterference of the earth\u2019s atmosphere with the telescope, the\nexistence of an asteroid belt which hides the new planet from the\nearth, etc). The suggestion is that the\n\u201cfalsification/corroboration\u201d disjunction offered by\nPopper is unjustifiable binary: non-corroboration is not necessarily\nfalsification, and falsification of a high-level scientific theory is\nnever brought about by an isolated observation or set of observations.\nSuch theories are, it is now widely accepted, highly resistant to\nfalsification; they are \u201ctenaciously protected from refutation\nby a vast \u2018protective belt\u2019 of auxiliary hypotheses\u201d\n(Lakatos 1978: 4) and so are falsified, if at all, not by Popperian\ncritical tests, but rather within the elaborate context of the\nresearch programmes associated with them gradually grinding to a halt.\nPopper\u2019s distinction between the logic of falsifiability and its\napplied methodology does not in the end do full justice to the fact\nthat all high-level theories grow and live despite the existence of\nanomalies (i.e., events/phenomena which are incompatible with them).\nThese, Lakatos suggests, are not usually taken by the working\nscientist as an indication that the theory in question is false. On\nthe contrary, in the context of a progressive research programme he or\nshe will necessarily assume that the auxiliary hypotheses which are\nassociated with the theory can in time be modified to incorporate, and\nthereby explain, recalcitrant phenomena.\n\nThird, Popper\u2019s critique of Marxism has not, of course, gone\nunchallenged. The debate arising from, however, has in many cases\ntended to revolve around ideological rather than philosophical issues,\nwhich will be passed over here. However, there have also been some\ntrenchant philosophical responses. Cornforth sees Marxism as a\nrational scientific discipline and Marxian thinking as \u201ca\nrational and scientific approach to social problems\u201d (Cornforth\n1968: 6) of the kind which both Marx and Popper consider important.\nConsequently, he takes Popper to task for representing Marxism as a\nsystem of dogmas designed to close minds or pre-empt the operation of\nour rational faculties in addressing social issues. Against that view,\nhe argues that it constitutes a way of thinking designed to open minds\nto the real possibilities of human life, and sees it as the philosophy\nbest calculated to promote the ideals of the open society to which he,\nlike Popper, subscribes. Hudelson (1980) argues that Marxian economics\nsurvives the Popperian critique of historicism and that, in any case,\nMarx did not hold many of the tenets of historicism identified by\nPopper. He also contends that Popper fails to show that there cannot\nbe, and that we cannot know, laws of social development and that Marx\ndid not in fact confuse trends and laws in the way that Popper\nsuggests.\n\nFourth, In the case of Freudian psychoanalysis, the adequacy of\nPopper\u2019s critique has been challenged on philosophical grounds\nby a number of commentators, particularly Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum (1984).\nGr\u00fcnbaum is highly critical, indeed scornful, of Popper\u2019s\ndismissal of the claims of psychoanalysis to be scientific and argues\nthat Freud showed \u201ca keen appreciation of methodological\npitfalls that are commonly laid at his door by critics\u201d\n(Gr\u00fcnbaum 1984: 168) such as Popper. He argues that Freud was\nsensitive to the question of the logic of the confirmation and\ndisconfirmation of psychoanalytic interpretations and cites\nFreud\u2019s use of the concept of consilience, the convergence of\nevidence from disparate sources, as a serious and explicit attempt to\nmeet the requirements of that logic. For Gr\u00fcnbaum, Popper\u2019s\ncritique of Freud amounts a veritable parody of the pioneering thinker\nwho established the discipline of psychoanalysis, and he attributes\nthat to Popper\u2019s \u201cobliviousness to Freud\u2019s actual\nwritings\u201d (1984: 124). He points out, for example, that the case\nof the drowning child which Popper uses in Conjectures and\nRefutations (Popper 1963: 35), upon which he rests part of his\ncase against psychoanalysis, is contrived and not in any way derived\nfrom Freud\u2019s actual clinical texts.\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum contends that there are instances in Freud\u2019s\nwritings where he shows himself to be \u201ca sophisticated\nscientific methodologist\u201d (Gr\u00fcnbaum 1984: 128), keenly\naware of the need for his theoretical system to meet the requirement\nof testability. One such occurs when Freud, in his assessment that\nanxiety neuroses are due to disturbances in sexual life, explicitly\nrefers to the notion of falsifiability: \u201cMy theory can only be\nrefuted when I have been shown phobias where sexual life is\nnormal\u201d (Freud 1895 [1962: 134]). Another occurs in\nFreud\u2019s 1915 paper \u201cA Case of Paranoia Running Counter to\nthe Psycho-Analytic Theory of the Disease\u201d, in which, as the\ntitle suggests, he saw the patient\u2019s collection of symptoms as\npotentially falsifying the theory. Moreover, Freud\u2019s entire\naccount of paranoia as being due to an underlying repressed\nhomosexuality is open to empirical refutation, Gr\u00fcnbaum argues,\nsince it has the testable implication that a reduction in rates of\nparanoia should result from a removal or loosening of social sanctions\nagainst same-sex relationships (1984: 111).\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum accordingly holds that Freudian theory should be\nconsidered falsifiable and therefore genuinely\nscientific\u2014albeit, in his view, ultimately unsuccessful, because\nthe clinical evidence offered in its favour is contaminated by\nsuggestion on the part of the analyst and cannot therefore support its\nconceptual weight. That is a verdict very different to what\nGr\u00fcnbaum sees as the reductive dismissal of Freud offered by\nPopper: \u201cthe inability of certain philosophers of science to\nhave discerned any testable consequences of Freud\u2019s\ntheory\u201d, he concludes, \u201cbetokens their insufficient\ncommand or scrutiny of its logical content rather than a scientific\nliability of psychoanalysis\u201d (1984: 113).\n\nThere can be little doubt of the seriousness of this challenge to\nPopper\u2019s critique of the claims of psychoanalytic theory to\nscientific status. Further, the unparalleled cultural impact of\nFreudianism upon contemporary life can scarcely be denied, and even a\ncursory examination of the vast corpus of Freud\u2019s works reveals\na thinker of quite extraordinary theoretical power and imagination\nwhose claims to scientific validity cannot be dismissed lightly.\n\nHowever, while the detail of this psychoanalytic response to Popper is\ncontestable, what is perhaps most striking and important about it is\nthat, as articulated by Gr\u00fcnbaum, it is itself couched in broad\nterms of an acceptance of a Popperian account of science. That is to\nsay, in rejecting the claim that psychoanalysis fails to meet the\nstandard of falsifiability specified by Popper,\nGr\u00fcnbaum\u2014who also rejects the hermeneutic interpretation of\nFreud offered by thinkers such as Paul Ricoeur and Jurgen\nHabermas\u2014nonetheless implicitly accepts that very standard, and\nwith it the broad sweep of Popper\u2019s theory of demarcation. For\nthat reason alone, it seems clear that Popper\u2019s work will\ncontinue to function as a critical reference point in the ongoing\ndebate regarding the scientific status of Freudian thought.\n\nFifth, scientific laws are usually expressed by universal statements\n(i.e., they take the logical form \u201cAll As are\nX\u201d, or some equivalent) which are therefore concealed\nconditionals\u2014they have to be understood as hypothetical\nstatements asserting what would be the case under certain ideal\nconditions. In themselves they are not existential in nature. Thus\n\u201cAll As are X\u201d means \u201cIf anything\nis an A, then it is X\u201d. Since scientific laws\nare non-existential in nature, they logically cannot in themselves\nimply any basic statements, since the latter are explicitly\nexistential. The question arises, then, as to how any basic statement\ncan falsify a scientific law, given that basic statements are not\ndeducible from scientific laws in themselves? Popper answers that\nscientific laws are always taken in conjunction with statements\noutlining the \u201cinitial conditions\u201d of the system under\ninvestigation; these latter, which are singular existential\nstatements, yield hard and fast implications when combined with the\nscientific law.\n\nThis reply is adequate only if it is true, as Popper assumes, that\nsingular existential statements will always do the work of bridging\nthe gap between a universal theory and a prediction. Hilary Putnam in\nparticular has argued that this assumption is false, in that in some\ncases at least the statements required to bridge this gap (which he\ncalls \u201cauxiliary hypotheses\u201d) are general rather than\nparticular, and consequently that when the prediction turns out to be\nfalse we have no way of knowing whether this is due to the falsity of\nthe scientific law or the falsity of the auxiliary hypotheses. The\nworking scientist, Putnam argues (Putnam 1974; see also the 1991\nreprinting with its retrospective note), always initially assumes that\nit is the latter, which shows not only that, but also why, scientific\nlaws are, contra Popper, highly resistant to falsification,\nas Kuhn (1962) and Lakatos (1970, 1978) have also argued.\n\nPopper\u2019s final position is that he acknowledges that it is\nimpossible to discriminate science from non-science on the basis of\nthe falsifiability of the scientific statements alone; he recognises\nthat scientific theories are predictive, and consequently prohibitive,\nonly when taken in conjunction with auxiliary hypotheses, and he also\nrecognises that readjustment or modification of the latter is an\nintegral part of scientific practice. Hence his final concern is to\noutline conditions which indicate when such modification is genuinely\nscientific, and when it is merely ad hoc. This is itself\nclearly a major alteration in his position, and arguably represents a\nsubstantial retraction on his part: Marxism can no longer be dismissed\nas \u201cunscientific\u201d simply because its advocates preserved\nthe theory from falsification by modifying it\u2014for in general\nterms, such a procedure, it transpires, is perfectly respectable\nscientific practice. It is now condemned as unscientific by Popper\nbecause the only rationale for the modifications which were made to\nthe original theory was to ensure that it evaded falsification, and so\nsuch modifications were ad hoc, rather than scientific. This\ncontention\u2014though not at all implausible\u2014has, to hostile\neyes, a somewhat contrived air about it, and is unlikely to worry the\nconvinced Marxist. On the other hand, the shift in Popper\u2019s own\nbasic position is taken by some critics as an indicator that\nfalsificationism, for all its apparent merits, fares no better in the\nfinal analysis than verificationism.\n",
