    "main_text": "Political Thought || Political Judgement and Leadership\n5.4 Political Judgement and Leadership\n\nApart from his better-known writings on liberty and pluralism,\nBerlin\u2019s political thought centred on two interrelated topics:\nthe nature of political judgement, and the ethics of political action.\nBerlin addressed the former subject both directly and through his\nwritings on individual statesmen who exemplified different sorts of\nsuccessful political judgement (see the portraits collected in Berlin\n1980, and Hanley 2004).\n\nBerlin disputed the idea that political judgement was a body of\nknowledge which could be reduced to rules. Political action should be\nbased on a \u2018sense of reality\u2019 founded on experience,\nempathetic understanding of others, sensitivity to the social and\npolitical environment, and personal judgement about what is true or\nuntrue, significant or trivial, alterable or unalterable, effective or\nuseless, etc. Such judgement necessarily involves personal instinct\nand flair, \u2018strokes of unanalysable genius\u2019. In the realm\nof political action, laws are few and skill is all (1996, 53).\n\nLike the study of history, political judgement involves reaching an\nunderstanding of the unique set of characteristics that constitute a\nparticular individual, atmosphere, state of affairs or event (ibid.,\n56). This requires a capacity for integrating \u2018a vast amalgam of\nconstantly changing, multicoloured, evanescent, perpetually\noverlapping data\u2019, a \u2018direct, almost sensuous contact with\nthe relevant data\u2019, and \u2018an acute sense of what fits with\nwhat, what springs from what, what leads to what; [\u2026] what the\nresult is likely to be in a concrete situation of the interplay of\nhuman beings and impersonal forces\u2019 (ibid., 57\u20138). Such a\nsense is qualitative rather than quantitative, specific rather than\ngeneral, for all that it may be built on past experience.\n\nThe faculty that allows for such judgement is, Berlin insists, not\nmetaphysical, but \u2018ordinary, empirical, and\nquasi-aesthetic\u2019 (ibid., 57). This sense is distinct from any\nsort of ethical sense; it could be possessed or lacked by both\nvirtuous and villainous politicians. Recognition of the importance of\nthis sense of political reality should not discourage the spirit of\nscientific enquiry or serve as an excuse for obscurantism. But it\nshould discourage the attempt to transform political action into the\napplication of scientific principles, and government into technocratic\n administration.[27]\n\nBerlin intended his writings on political judgement as a warning to\npolitical theorists not to overreach themselves. Political theory can\ndo much good in helping us to make sense of politics. But political\naction is a practical matter, which should not, and cannot, be founded\non, or dictated by, general principles established through abstract\ntheorising.\n\nBerlin\u2019s writings on political judgement, activity and\nleadership are of a piece with his larger epistemological project: to\nbring to light the tension between abstract or a priori theory and\ndirect perception; and to warn against the dangers of the former and\nassert the importance of the latter. While he acknowledged that it was\nimpossible to think without the use of analogies and metaphors, that\nthought necessarily involves generalisation and comparison, he warned\nthat it was important to be cautious, self-conscious and critical in\nthe use of general models and analogies (see 1978b, 207\u20138).\nThese writings also reassert the message of the youthful essay\n\u2018Some Procrustations\u2019 (1930, discussed in 4.3 above): that\nthe same rules should not be automatically applied to every facet of\nhuman life. Rationality consists of the application, not of a single\ntechnique or set of rules, but of those methods that have proven to\nwork best in each particular field or situation. This view of\npolitical judgement also relates to Berlin\u2019s attempt to\nvindicate the importance of individual agency and personality, by\ninsisting that political judgement is a personal quality, and\neffective political activity a matter of personal consideration,\ndecision and action rather than (or at least in addition to)\nimpersonal administration or the deployment of institutional\nmachinery.\n5.5 Political Ethics: Ends, Means, Violence\n\nWhile Berlin emphasised the place of questions about the proper ends\nof political action in the subject matter of political theory, he also\nrecognised the importance of discussions of the proper means to\nemploy, and the relationship between these and the ends at which they\naim. Berlin did not treat this question \u2013 the question of\npolitical ethics \u2013 directly in his work; nor did he offer simple\nor confident answers to the perennial questions of the morality of\npolitical action. Nevertheless, he did advance some theses about this\nbranch of morality; and these were among his most heartfelt\npronouncements.\n\nBerlin\u2019s primary mouthpiece for these messages was Alexander\nHerzen, the nineteenth-century Russian radical\n publicist.[28]\n The words of Herzen that Berlin repeated most insistently were those\ncondemning the sacrifice of human beings on the altar of abstractions,\nthe subordination of the realities of individual happiness or\nunhappiness in the present to glorious but fantastical dreams of the\nfuture (Berlin 1990, 16\u201317; Berlin also quoted similar\nsentiments from Benjamin Constant: see Berlin 2002b, 3, as well as\n1978a, 93\u2013129 and 212\u201339 passim). The first\nprinciple of Berlin\u2019s political ethics was to oppose such\nsubordination, which Berlin viewed as the essence of fanaticism, and a\nrecipe for inhumanity that was as futile as it was horrible.\n\nBerlin, like Herzen, believed that \u2018the goal of life is life\nitself\u2019 (1978a, 221; Herzen 1842, 217), and that each life and\neach age should be regarded as its own end and not as a means to some\nfuture goal. To this he added a caution (evocative as much of Max\nWeber as of Herzen) about the unpredictability of the future.\nBerlin\u2019s belief in the power of human agency was qualified by an\nawareness of how the consequences of any course of action are\nunknowable, and likely to be quite different from what was intended.\nThis led him, on the one hand, to stress the need for caution and\nmoderation; and, on the other, to insist that uncertainty is\ninescapable, so that all action, however carefully undertaken,\ninvolves the risk of error, and of disastrous, or at least unexpected\nand troubling, consequences. The result was an ethic of political\nhumility, similar to Weber\u2019s ethic of responsibility, but\nlacking its tone of grim, stoic grandeur.\n\nBerlin often noted the dangers of utopianism, and stressed the need\nfor a measure of political pragmatism. He may therefore appear to have\nbeen staunchly in the tradition of \u2018political realism\u2019,\ntypically seen as running from Machiavelli (or Thucydides) through to\nrecent scholars, and practitioners, of realpolitik such as E. H. Carr,\nGeorge Kennan or Henry\n Kissinger.[29]\n Yet this was not quite so. Berlin did indeed seek to warn against the\ndangers of idealism, and to chasten it, in order to save it from\nitself and better defend it against cynicism. But in writing of\n\u2018realism in politics\u2019 he distinguished between a correct\nperception of reality, free of emotional distortions, and another,\n\u2018more sinister\u2019 sense of the term, deployed by people who\nadmitted to being \u2018realists\u2019, \u2018usually to explain\naway some unusually mean or brutal decision\u2019. In this sense,\n\u2018realistic\u2019 had come to mean \u2018harsh and brutal, not\nshrinking from what is usually considered immoral, not swayed by soft\nsentimental moral considerations\u2019; it was also identified, in\nBerlin\u2019s mind, with the \u2018identification of what is good\nand what is successful\u2019, and a tendency to celebrate \u2018the\nbig battalions, marching down a broad avenue, with all the unfulfilled\npossibilities, all the martyrs and visionaries, wiped out\u2019\n(2000a, 163; 2002a, 103\u20136). While he insisted on the importance\nof a \u2018sense of reality\u2019, Berlin was highly critical of the\nsecond form of \u2018political realism\u2019, which scornfully\ndisregarded moral ideals or scruples, and embraced dubious means to\nachieve desired ends. He also saw this sort of cynical, brutal realism\nas a powerful political force in the world (2002b, 343\u20134; see\nalso Cherniss 2013, 67\u201387, 112\u201321, and Cherniss 2018).\n\n\u2018Realism\u2019 understood as a justification for cynical and\nbrutal conduct was, according to Berlin, not only morally repulsive,\nbut unrealistic, in so far as it rested on an assumption that one\ncould achieve truly desirable ends through the use of morally wicked\nmeans; against this, Berlin asserted that \u2018evil means destroy\ngood ends\u2019 (1978a, 345). Indeed, the problem of the relationship\nbetween ends and means runs through his writings. Characteristically,\nhe warned against both an insistence on total political purity \u2013\nfor, when values conflict and consequences are often unexpected,\npurity is an impossible ideal \u2013 and a disregard for the ethical\nniceties of political means. He regarded the latter attitude as not\nonly morally ugly, but foolish, given the tendency for good ends to be\ncorrupted and undermined by unscrupulous means. Furthermore, since the\nconsequences of actions are so uncertain, political actors often\ndon\u2019t achieve their goals, or they achieve them imperfectly; so\nit is best not to make too many sacrifices in the course of\naccomplishing one\u2019s political goals, since that accomplishment\nis uncertain. To the realist argument that \u2018You cannot make an\nomelette without breaking eggs\u2019, Berlin responded: \u2018The\none thing that we may be sure of is the reality of the sacrifice, the\ndying and the dead. But the ideal for the sake of which they die\nremains unrealised. The eggs are broken, and the habit of breaking\nthem grows, but the omelette remains invisible\u2019 (1990, 17).\n\nBerlin was thoroughly anti-absolutist; but he did insist that there\nwere certain actions that were, except in the most drastic of\nsituations, unacceptable. Foremost among these were the manipulation\nand humiliation of individuals by others, to the extent that those who\nare \u2018got at\u2019 or \u2018tampered with\u2019 by others are\ndeprived of their humanity (see 2002b, 184, 337, 339, 341\u20132).\nBerlin also warned particularly against the use of violence. He\nacknowledged that the use of force was sometimes necessary and\njustified; but he also reminded his readers that violence has\nparticularly volatile and unpredictable consequences, and tends to\nspiral out of control, leading to terrible destruction and suffering,\nand undermining the noble goals it seeks to achieve. He also stressed\nthe dangers of paternalistic, or otherwise humiliating and\ndisempowering, attempts to institute reform or achieve improvement,\nwhich had a tendency to inspire a backlash of hatred and\nresistance.\n\nBerlin\u2019s political ethics are best summarised in his own\nwords:\n\nLet us at least have the courage of our admitted ignorance, of our\ndoubts and uncertainties. At least we can try to discover what others\n[\u2026] require, by [\u2026] making it possible for ourselves to\nknow men as they truly are, by listening to them carefully and\nsympathetically, and understanding them and their lives and their\nneeds, one by one individually. Let us at least try to provide them\nwith what they ask for, and leave them as free as possible. (1978a,\n296)\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nBerlin\u2019s life and work continue to be the subject of\nconsiderable attention. This attention has yet to yield a settled\nconsensus about the merits or the meaning of Berlin\u2019s work\n\u2013 and not only because Berlin evokes strong personal reactions,\nattracting admiration and affection, if not outright veneration as a\nliberal saint (see e.g. Annan 1980, 1990, 1999; Hausheer 1979 and\n2004), and inspiring hostility from critics on both the right and\nleft, who have detected in Berlin\u2019s stance complacency,\nhypocrisy, a want of courage and an excess of tolerance (see e.g.\nScruton 1989, Hitchens 1998). This is to be expected, given\nBerlin\u2019s fierce opposition to Communism, combined with his\nrefusal to ally himself to extreme anti-Communism, as well as his\nambivalence or reticence on many divisive political issues of his own\nday.\n\nHowever, even as the ideological battles of the Cold War recede into\nthe past (not everywhere: in post-Communist Europe, in China and\nRussia and elsewhere they are still very much alive), Berlin remains\nthe object of varying interpretations and evaluations. This may appear\nodd in a thinker who wrote clearly, and without obfuscating jargon.\nBut it is unsurprising, given the complexity of Berlin\u2019s vision,\nhis aversion to systematic exposition or theorising, the multifaceted\nnature of his work, and the uniqueness of his position in the\nintellectual life of his times. These qualities make it difficult not\nonly to evaluate Berlin, but also to situate him in the history of\nideas; for he appears at once typical and atypical of the period in\nwhich he lived, and also both ahead of his time and somewhat\nold-fashioned.\n\nIn his youth, Berlin\u2019s intellectual development followed that of\nEnglish-language philosophy; yet he drifted away from the analytic\nphilosophy in which he had once been deeply involved, and his later\nwritings are a world away from most Anglo-American philosophy of their\ntime. On the other hand, for all his range of historical and cultural\nreference, and his concern with moral and aesthetic questions, and\ndespite the influence of Kant and Kant\u2019s successors on his\nthought, Berlin seems out of place in the world of Continental\nphilosophy. Yet it would be a mistake to accept Berlin\u2019s own\njudgement that he had departed from the realm of philosophy\naltogether. For both the views he had formed while working as a\nprofessional philosopher, and his tendency to connect political,\nhistorical and cultural issues to deeper moral and epistemological\nquestions, set his work apart from that of other historians and\n\u2018public intellectuals\u2019 of his day.\n\nBerlin was, for much of his life, an intellectually lonely figure,\npursuing the history of ideas in an academic setting that was\nunreceptive to it, and advocating a moderate liberalism in a time\ndominated by ideological extremism. And yet this plea for moderation\nand advocacy of liberalism was shared and taken up by many others at\nthe\n time.[30]\n His interest in political philosophy and his dedication to the\ndefence of liberalism anticipated the work of John Rawls (who had been\ninfluenced by Berlin during a stay at Oxford while a young academic);\nyet the resurgence of normative political theory initiated by\nRawls\u2019s work coincided with a period of eclipse in\nBerlin\u2019s reputation. Berlin\u2019s concern with the nature of\nculture anticipated the centrality in political theory of questions of\nidentity and membership that began in the 1990s; his sympathy for the\nsentiments and needs underlying nationalism, which set him apart from\nmany liberal theorists of his own time, presaged the revival of\n\u2018liberal nationalism\u2019 in the works of younger thinkers\nsuch as Michael Walzer, David Miller, Yael Tamir and Michael\nIgnatieff. His attack on monism, on the quest for certainty and the\nproject of systematic knowledge, has led him to be embraced by some\ncritics of foundationalism such as Richard Rorty and John Gray. Yet\nBerlin\u2019s work remains difficult to assimilate to intellectual\nmovements or projects such as postmodernism or multiculturalism, the\nexcesses and obscurities of which provoked quizzical scepticism in him\ntowards the end of his life.\n\nNor is Berlin easy to identify seamlessly with those intellectual\npositions that he explicitly propounded \u2013 liberalism and\npluralism. Although he appears as an important, and indeed emblematic,\nexponent of liberalism \u2013 along with Rawls, one of the most\nimportant liberal theorists of his century \u2013 his ideas may\nnevertheless in the end help to undermine, or at least challenge,\nconventional, often monistic, liberalism. This question has come to\npreoccupy many readers of Berlin\u2019s work, and predominate in\ndiscussions of his legacy, to the extent of threatening to overshadow\nother aspects of his thought.\n\nThe debate over pluralism and liberalism raises important conceptual\nissues; yet it becomes somewhat misleading, both in itself and\nparticularly as a guide to Berlin\u2019s thought, if pluralism and\nliberalism are taken to be comprehensive doctrines, or if they are\nreified into independently existing, systematic entities.\n\u2018Pluralism\u2019 and \u2018liberalism\u2019 as general terms\nare abstractions which can help to group, analyse and compare the\npositions of different thinkers, or to characterise different facets\nof the thought of a single thinker. Neither, however, is likely to\ncapture the whole of an individual position; and neither in itself\nencompasses or sums up Berlin\u2019s own outlook.\n\nBerlin himself insisted that political and ethical theories arise from\na thinker\u2019s basic conception of human nature, which in turn is\nfounded on an entire philosophical outlook, a conception of the nature\nof the universe, reality, knowledge etc. The vision underlying\nBerlin\u2019s political and ethical theory, while it may have been\ncoherent (this is itself arguable), was not systematic, and, again, it\ncannot be accurately characterised simply as pluralistic or liberal.\n\u2018Pluralism\u2019 can be used, more narrowly, to describe\nBerlin\u2019s theory of values. It can also be employed more broadly,\nto capture something of his vision of reality, the universe and human\nnature \u2013 that is, the view that all of these things are\ncomplexes made up of separate and conflicting parts: that the self is\nprotean and open-ended, that the universe is not a harmonious cosmos,\nthat reality presents many separate aspects, which can and should be\nviewed from different perspectives. But \u2018pluralism\u2019, as\nexplicitly defined by Berlin and others, does not cover Berlin\u2019s\nempiricism, or his historicism, or his awareness of the fallibility of\nhuman knowledge, or his belief in the primary importance of\nindividuals as opposed to generalisations and abstractions, or his\nemphasis on the importance of free choice (which, while he sought to\nfound it on pluralism, in fact appears to be partly independent of\nit). Nor does pluralism, with its emphasis on the place of tragic\nconflict and loss in human life, capture the affirmative zest for life\nand delighted enthusiasm for human beings that was central to\nBerlin\u2019s persona as a man and thinker. Berlin\u2019s thought,\nlike his writing, is made up both of swathes of sharp colour and of\nminutely variegated and subtle shades of light and darkness; it thus\nresists summary and simple conclusions, and repays persistent and\nopen-ended study.",
