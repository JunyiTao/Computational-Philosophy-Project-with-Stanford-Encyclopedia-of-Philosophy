Dennett claims the cassette theory and\nthe view that dreams are experiences can deal equally well with\nempirical evidence for instance on the relationship between dreaming\nand REM sleep. The cassette theory is preferable because it is more\nparsimonious, positing only an unconscious dream composition process\nrather than an additional conscious presentation process in sleep. For\nDennett, the important point is that it is impossible to distinguish\nbetween the two rival theories based on dream recall; the question of\ndream experience should be settled by independent empirical\nevidence.\n\nWhile Dennett shares Malcolm\u2019s skepticism about dream experience, this\nlatter claim is diametrically opposed to Malcolm\u2019s rejection of\na science of dreaming. For Dennett, the unreliability of dream recall\nalso is not unique, but exemplifies a broader problem with memory\nreports: we generally cannot use retrospective recall to distinguish\nconscious experience from memory insertion (Dennett 1991; see also\nEmmett 1978).\n\nAn earlier and much discussed (Binz 1878; Goblot 1896; Freud 1899;\nHall 1981; Kramer 2007:22\u201324) version of Dennett\u2019s\ncassette theory goes back to Maury\u2019s (1861) description of a long and\ncomplex dream about the French revolution that culminated in his\nexecution at the guillotine, at which point Maury suddenly awoke to\nfind that the headboard had fallen on his neck. Because the dream\nseemed to systematically build up to this dramatic conclusion, which\nin turn coincided with a sudden external event, he suggested that such\ncases were best explained as instantaneous memory insertions\nexperienced at the moment of awakening. Similarly, Gregory (1916)\ndescribed dreams are psychical explosions occurring at the moment of\nawakening.\n\nThe trustworthiness of dream reports continues to be contentious.\nRosen (2013) argues that dream reports are often fabricated and fail\nto accurately describe experiences occurring during sleep. By\ncontrast, Windt (2013, 2015a) argues that dream reports can at least\nunder certain conditions (such as in laboratory studies, when dreams\nare reported immediately after awakening by trained participants) be\nregarded as trustworthy sources of evidence with respect to previous\nexperience during sleep.\n",
