    "main_text": "Frame I: Conceptual Content\n3. Frame I: Conceptual Content\n\nThe reception of Kant\u2019s philosophy in the latter half of the\ntwentieth century (e.g., Sellars 1968; McDowell 1996; Hanna 2005;\nGinsborg 2006b; Haag 2007; Allais 2009) typically presents him as\neither accepting or rejecting the view that experience has\n\u201cconceptual content.\u201d One way to frame this dispute is in\nterms of the acceptance or rejection of the following statement of\n\u2018Conceptualism\u2019:\n\nConceptualism:\n\nThe \u2018content\u2019 (Inhalt) of an intuition is\nconceptual, and constitutes its cognitive relation to a (putatively)\nmind-independent object\n\nConceptualist readings of Kant thus claim that there is a relevant\nsense in which (i) intuitions have content; (ii) the content of the\nintuition is conceptual; (iii) it is this conceptual content that\nconstitutes or determines the cognitive relation of the intuition (as\na mental state) to a mind-independent object (or in the case of inner\nsense, to the object that is oneself). According to the contrasting\nposition, \u2018Nonconceptualism\u2019:\n\nNonconceptualism:\n\nThe \u2018content\u2019 of an intuition is at least partly\nnonconceptual, and is sufficient to constitute a cognitive relation to\na (putatively) mind-independent object\n\nOne caveat worth noting: the qualification concerning\n\u201cputatively\u201d mind-independent objects is meant to allow\nfor hallucination and illusion (see Allais 2010, 2011a; Roche 2011;\nStephenson 2015, 2017; Gr\u00fcne 2017a; McLear 2017). This\nqualification also provides leeway concerning exactly what is meant by\n\u201cmind-independent\u201d, especially since Kant\u2019s\narticulation of Transcendental Idealism entails that finite beings\nintuit (in some sense) mind-dependent appearances and not (in some\nsense) mind-independent things as they are in themselves (Allais 2015;\nsee also the entry on Kant\u2019s\n transcendental idealism).\n\nOne might argue that Kant articulates an endorsement of Conceptualism\nin \u00a717 of B-Deduction of the first Critique, where he\nsays that\n\n\nThe understanding is, to speak generally, the faculty of cognitions.\nThis consists in the determinate relation of given representations to\nan object. But an object is that in the concept of which the manifold\nof a given intuition is united. Now, all unification of\nrepresentations requires the unity of consciousness in the synthesis\nof the same [i.e., the representations]. It follows that the unity of\nconsciousness alone establishes [ausmacht] the relation of\nrepresentations to an object, their objective validity, and thus their\nbecoming cognitions. (B137; cf. A197/B242-3)\n\n\nThe language used here has seemed to many to indicate that the unity\nof consciousness achieved via categorial synthesis is necessary for\nany cognitive relation to an object (e.g., Bird 1962: 130\u2013131;\nGuyer 1987: 11\u201324; Pereboom 2006: 160; Pereboom 2009; cf. Land\n2012). Put another way, intuitions must have conceptual content if\nthey are to have cognitive relation to an object.\n\nWhile there may be a variety of reasons for reading Kant as endorsing\nConceptualism, so understood, two stand out. The first is\nphilosophically motivated by the position that sense experience can\nplay a rational or justificatory role with respect to belief or\njudgment only if such experience possesses conceptual content (see\n \u00a75.1\n for discussion). Second, many think that the only plausible way of\ninterpreting Kant\u2019s argument in the Transcendental Deduction of\nthe Critique of Pure Reason requires that he endorse\nConceptualism (see\n \u00a75.5\n for discussion).\n\nHence, interpreters endorsing some form or another of\n\u2018Nonconceptualism\u2019 typically take a contrasting stance\nregarding Kant\u2019s position concerning either the justificatory\nrelationship between sense experience and belief or judgment, or the\nproper interpretation of his argument in the Deduction.\n\nHowever, the framing of the dispute between Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism as one concerning conceptual content faces\nstraightforward interpretive challenges, independently of where one\nstands as to the justificatory role of experience or the best way to\ninterpret the argument of the Deduction. These challenges concern each\nelement of the Conceptualist thesis. First\n (\u00a73.1),\n it seems that when close attention is paid to Kant\u2019s notion of\n\u2018content\u2019 (Inhalt) it cannot be the case that\nintuitions have conceptual content. Second\n (\u00a73.2),\n Kant\u2019s conception of concepts as always employed in judgment\nappears incompatible with the claim that concepts provide intuition\nwith cognitive relation to an object. Third\n (\u00a73.3),\n attempts to avoid these challenges by attributing a conception of\n\u2018content\u2019 to Kant in line with our contemporary notion of\nrepresentational content do not obviously cohere with his\nview of the contribution of intuition to cognition. The next three\nsubsections detail these challenges. Again, it is important to note\nthat though these challenges are often raised by advocates of some\nform or another of Nonconceptualism, the challenges themselves are\nindependent of any specific answer concerning, first, whether and how\nintuition justifies judgment, and second, how Kant proceeds in the\nargument of the Deduction. After discussing these three challenges to\nthe conceptual content frame regarding its plausibility as an\ninterpretation of Kant (this entry shall largely prescind from\ndiscussing Conceptualism\u2019s independent philosophical\nplausibility),\n \u00a74\n then examines an alternative way of framing the debate that does not\nraise these concerns.\n",
