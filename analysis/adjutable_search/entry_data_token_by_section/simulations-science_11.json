    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Computer Simulations || Verification and Validation\n4.3 Verification and Validation\n\n\nPractitioners of simulation, particularly in engineering contexts,\nin weapons testing, and in climate science, tend to conceptualize\nthe EOCS in terms of verification and validation. \nVerification is said to be the process of determining whether\nthe output of the simulation approximates the true solutions to the\ndifferential equations of the original model. Validation, on\nthe other hand, is said to be the process of determining whether the\nchosen model is a good enough representation of the real-world system\nfor the purpose of the simulation. The literature on verification and\nvalidation from engineers and scientists is enormous and it is\nbeginning to receive some attention from philosophers.\n\n\nVerification can be divided into solution verification and code\nverification. The former verifies that the output of the intended\nalgorithm approximates the true solutions to the differential\nequations of the original model. The latter verifies that the\ncode, as written, carries out the intended algorithm. Code\nverification has been mostly ignored by philosophers of science;\nprobably because it has been seen as more of a problem in computer\nscience than in empirical science\u2014perhaps a mistake. Part of solution\nverification consists in comparing computed output with analytic\nsolutions (so called \u201cbenchmark solutions\u201d). \nThough this method can of course help to make case for the results of a\ncomputer simulation, it is by itself inadequate, since\nsimulations are often used precisely because analytic solution is\nunavailable for regions of solution space that are of interest. Other\nindirect techniques are available: the most important of which is\nprobably checking to see whether and at what rate computed output\nconverges to a stable solution as the time and spatial resolution of\nthe discretization grid gets finer.\n\n\nThe principal strategy of validation involves comparing model output\nwith observable data. Again, of course, this strategy is\nlimited in most cases, where simulations are being run because\nobservable data are sparse. But complex strategies can be\nemployed, including comparing the output of subsystems of a simulation\nto relevant experiments (Parker, 2013; Oberkampf and Roy\n2010).\n\n\nThe concepts of verification and validation has drawn some criticism\nfrom philosophers. Oreskes et al. 1994, a very widely-cited article,\nwas mostly critical of the terminology, arguing that\n\u201cvalidity,\u201d in particular, is a property that only applies\nto logical arguments, and that hence the term, when applied to models,\nmight lead to overconfidence.\n\n\nWinsberg (2010, 2018, p.155) has argued that the conceptual division\nbetween verification and validation can be misleading, if it is taken\nto suggest that there is one set of methods which can, by itself, show\nthat we have solved the equations right, and that there is another set\nof methods, which can, by itself, show that we\u2019ve got the right\nequations. He also argued that it is misleading to think that the\nepistemology of simulation is cleanly divided into an empirical part\n(verification) and a mathematical (and computer science) part\n(validation.) But this misleading idea often follows discussion of\nverification and validation. We find this both in the work of\npractitioners and philosophers.\n\n\nHere is the standard line from a practitioner, Roy:\n\u201cVerification deals with mathematics and addresses the\ncorrectness of the numerical solution to a given model. Validation, on\nthe other hand, deals with physics and addresses the appropriateness\nof the model in reproducing experimental data. Verification can be\nthought of as solving the chosen equations correctly, while validation\nis choosing the correct equations in the first place\u201d (Roy\n2005).\n\n\nSome philosophers have put this distinction to work in arguments\nabout the philosophical novelty of simulation. We first\nraised this issue in section 4.1, where Frigg and Reiss argued that\nsimulation could have no epistemologically novel features, since it\ncontained two distinct components: a component that is identical\nto the epistemology of ordinary modeling, and a component that is\nentirely mathematical. \u201cWe should distinguish two\ndifferent notions of reliability here, answering two different\nquestions. First, are the solutions that the computer provides close\nenough to the actual (but unavailable) solutions to be\nuseful?\u2026this is a purely mathematical question and falls within\nthe class of problems we have just mentioned. So, there is nothing new\nhere from a philosophical point of view and the question is indeed one\nof number crunching. Second, do the computational models that are the\nbasis of the simulations represent the target system correctly? That\nis, are the simulation results externally valid? This is a serious\nquestion, but one that is independent of the \ufb01rst problem, and\none that equally arises in connection with models that do not involve\nintractable mathematics and ordinary experiments\u201d (Frigg\nand Reiss 2009).\n\n\nBut verification and validation are not, strictly speaking, so cleanly\nseparable. That is because most methods of validation, by themselves,\nare much too weak to establish the validity of a simulation. And most\nmodel equations chosen for simulation are not in any straightforward\nsense \u201cthe right equations\u201d; they are not the model\nequations we would choose in an ideal world. We have good reason to\nthink, in other words, that there are model equations out there that\nenjoy better empirical support, in the abstract. The equations we\nchoose often reflect a compromise between what we think best describes\nthe phenomena and computational tractability. So the equations that\nare chosen are rarely well \u201cvalidated\u201d on their own. If we\nwant to understand why simulation results are taken to be credible, we\nhave to look at the epistemology of simulation as an integrated whole,\nnot as cleanly divided into verification and validation\u2014each of\nwhich, on its own, would look inadequate to the task.\n\n\nSo one point is that verification and validation are not\nindependently-successful and separable activities. But the other point\nis that there are not two independent entities onto which these\nactivities can be directed: a model chosen to discretized, and a method\nfor discretizing it. Once one recognizes that the equations to be\n\u201csolved\u201d are sometimes chosen so as to cancel out\ndiscretization errors, etc. (Lenhard 2007 has a very nice example of\nthis involving the Arakawa operator), this later distinction gets harder\nto maintain. So success is achieved in simulation with a kind of\nback-and-forth, trial-and-error, piecemeal adjustment between model and\nmethod of calculation. And when this is the case, it is hard even to\nknow what it means to say that a simulation is separately verified and\nvalidated.\n\n\nNo one has argued that V&V isn\u2019t a useful distinction, but\nrather that scientists shouldn\u2019t overinflate a pragmatically\nuseful distinction into a clean methodological dictate that\nmisrepresents the messiness of their own practice. Collaterally, Frigg\nand Reiss\u2019s argument for the absence of epistemological novelty\nin simulation fails for just this reason.  It is not \u201ca purely\nmathematical question\u201d whether the solutions that the computer\nprovides close enough to the actual (but unavailable) solutions to be\nuseful. At least not in this respect: it is not a question that can be\nanswered, as a pragmatic matter, entirely using mathematical\nmethods. And hence it is an empirical/epistemological issue that does\nnot arise in ordinary modeling.\n",
