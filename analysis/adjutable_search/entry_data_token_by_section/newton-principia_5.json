    "main_text": "Book 1 of the Principia\n6. Book 1 of the Principia\n\n\nBook 1 develops a mathematical theory of motion under centripetal\nforces. In keeping with the Euclidean tradition, the propositions\nmathematically derived from the laws of motion are labeled either as\ntheorems or as problems. The theorems all have an \u201cif-then\u201d form,\nenabling them to authorize inferences of their consequents, given\ntheir\n antecedents.[30]\nBut then so too do the problems in\neffect have an \u201cif-then\u201d logical form, for the (geometric style)\nsolutions they provide authorize inferences from given information to\nunknowns. The best way to think of the derived propositions,\ntherefore, is as \u201cinference-tickets.\u201d As such, the propositions\nfall into three categories: (1) ones that license conclusions about\nforces from information about motions, (2) ones that license conclusions\nabout motions from information about forces, and (3) ones that license\nconclusions about (net) forces directed toward whole bodies from\ninformation about (contributing) forces directed toward the individual\nparts of the bodies.\n\n\nA fundamental contrast between Newton's mathematical theory of motion\nunder centripetal forces and the mathematical theories of motion\ndeveloped by Galileo and Huygens is that Newton's is generic.  Galileo\nand Huygens examined one kind of force, uniform gravity, with a goal\nof deriving testable consequences. Newton's theory covers not only\nforces that vary as 1/r2, for which the\nPrincipia is famous, but also forces that vary as r,\nas 1/r3, and even as any arbitrary function of\nr. At the end of Section 11 he gives a reason, quoted\nearlier:\n\n\nMathematics requires an investigation of those quantities of\nforces and their proportions that follow from any conditions that may\nbe supposed. Then, coming down to physics, these proportions must\nbe compared with the phenomena, so that it may be found out which\nconditions of forces apply to each kind of attracting bodies. And\nthen, finally, it will be possible to argue more securely concerning\nthe physical species, physical causes, and physical\nproportions of these forces. [P, 588f]\n\n\nHe had other reasons as well. The theory of gravity entails\nthat gravity below the surface of a uniformly dense sphere varies\nlinearly with the distance from the center, and hence, at least to a\nfirst approximation, this is how gravity varies below the surface of\nthe Earth. Centripetal forces that vary as\n1/r3 hold if and only if the trajectory is\na\n spiral;[31]\nand,\ngiven any stationary orbit governed by centripetal forces,\nsuperposition of a 1/r3 centripetal force will\ncause that orbit to precess, as in the case of the lunar\n orbit.[32]\nStill,\nNewton's main reason appears to have been the one given in the\nquotation.\n\n\nIn one curious respect that Newton mentions only once in passing, the\ntheory does not cover all \u201cconditions that may be supposed.\u201d\nNewton's theory treats centripetal forces that vary only with the\ndistance from the force center, that is, ones for which the force on\ntwo bodies equally distant from that center is always the same.\nIt does not treat centripetal forces that vary with \u03b8\nand \u03c6, the two angular components of (r,\n\u03b8, \u03c6) spherical coordinates. This is\nnotable for two reasons. First, the central forces arising in\nCartesian vortices would almost certainly have varied with both of\nthese angular components, and hence Newton is tacitly begging a\nquestion. Second, as Newton himself realized and noted in Section\n13 of Book 1, gravity around a spheroid does not vary simply as\n1/r2, but must also vary with\n latitude.[33]\nFrom\nNewton's point of view, therefore, gravity around Jupiter and the\nEarth, and surely the Sun as well, does not vary simply as\n1/r2. This is one of many often ignored cues\npointing to the extent to which the evidential reasoning in the\nPrincipia has to be more intricate and subtle than was\nappreciated at the time, or for that matter even now.\n\n\nUp to the end of Section 10, Book 1 considers forces that are directed\ntoward geometric centers rather than bodies. As a consequence, only\nthe first two laws of motion enter into any of the proofs until late\nin Book 1. Even further, as Newton develops the theory to that point,\nonly the accelerative measure of force is employed, and hence even\nmass plays no role. Included in this segment are by far the\nmost widely read parts of Book 1, then and now: Section 2, which deals\nwith centripetal forces generally, and Section 3, which develops\nNewton's fundamental discovery that a body moves in a conic section,\nsweeping out equal areas in equal times about a focus, if and only if\nthe motion is governed by an inverse-square centripetal force directed\ntoward this focus. The stick-figure picture of Book 1 that results\nfrom viewing these two sections as its high point blinds the reader\nnot only to the richness of the theory developed in it, but also to\nseveral no less important results derived in the rest of it.\n\n\nThe paragraph that opens Section 11 announces, \u201cUp to this point I have\nbeen setting forth the motions of bodies attracted toward an immovable\ncenter, such as, however, hardly exists in the natural world\u2026. I\nnow go on to set forth the motion of bodies that attract one another\u201d\n[P, 561] The section first successfully solves\nthe problem of the motion of two bodies under inverse-square mutual\nattraction. It then turns to the case of more than two bodies,\nfor which Newton can solve only the case of mutual attraction that\nvaries linearly with the distance between bodies. For the\ninverse-square case, Newton gives only qualitative results, most of\nthem in 22 corollaries to Proposition 66 that Newton calls \u201cimperfect\u201d\nin the Preface to the first edition. All of these corollaries\nidentify qualitative tendencies in the motions of a body orbiting a\nsecond body and attracted to a third, with the majority of the results\ndirected specifically to the perturbing effects of the Sun on the\nmotion of our Moon. It is with Section 11, then, that the\nPrincipia departs from the realm of the \u201cDe Motu\u201d tract and\nbegins to consider the complexities of the true motions.\n\n\nSections 12 and 13 treat attractive forces between bodies that result\nfrom \u2014 are composed out of \u2014 centripetal forces between each of the\nindividual microphysical particles forming them. Section 12\ntreats spherical bodies, and Section 13, non-spherical bodies. As\nNewton anticipated, this was the part of Book 1 that would arouse the\nstrongest complaints from readers committed to the view that all forces\ninvolve contact between bodies. On top of this, nowhere in Book 1\ndid the mathematics become more demanding than here. These two\nsections give primary attention to inverse-square forces and forces\nthat vary linearly with distance, but, just as earlier in Book 1, some\nresults pertain to forces that vary in other ways, included among which\nare results pointing to experiments that might differentiate between\ninverse-square and any alternative to it. In the Scholium to\nProposition 78 Newton singles out the result of this inquiry that he\nregarded as most notable:\n\n\nI have now set forth the two major cases of attractions, namely when\nthe centripetal forces decrease in the squared ratio of the distances\nor increase in the simple ratio of the distances, causing bodies to\nrevolve in conics, and composing centripetal forces of spherical\nbodies that decrease or increase in proportion to the distance from\nthe center according to the same law \u2014 which is worthy of note.\n[P,\n 599][34]\n\n\nThis is one of the few places in the Principia where Newton\nsingles out a result in an aside in this way. That an attracting\nsphere can be treated as if the mass were concentrated at its center in\nthe case of attractive forces that vary linearly with the distance was\nnot so notable, for as Newton shows in Section 13, in this case of\nattractive forces an attracting body always can be treated as if the\nmass were located at its center of gravity, regardless of shape.\nThe truly notable finding is that it is also true of spheres in the\ncase of inverse-square forces. The subsequent results in Sections\n12 and 13 indicate that, in the case of all other kinds of centripetal\nforce, the attraction toward a sphere is not the same as attraction\ntoward all its mass concentrated in the center; and even in the\ninverse-square case, the result does not hold for other shapes or for\nspheres that do not have spherically symmetric density.\n\n\nAlthough Newton does not so expressly single out other results of Book\n1, a few deserve comment here. The key that opened the way to\nNewton's theory of motion under centripetal forces was his discovery of\nhow to generalize to non-circular trajectories the solution that he and\nHuygens had obtained for the central force in uniform circular\nmotion. Figure 2 shows Newton's diagram for this generalization\nfrom the first edition. Suppose first that the trajectory APQ is\npart of a circle of radius SP along which the body at P is moving\nuniformly. Both Newton and Huygens had reasoned that the\ndisplacement QR from the tangent is proportional to the product of the\nforce retaining the body in its circular orbit and the square of the\ntime t for the body to\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nmove from P to Q, and hence the force varies as\nQR/t2. But the time is proportional to PQ\ndivided by the velocity v, and in the limit as Q approaches P,\nPQ approaches PR, so that t2 becomes equal to\nPR2/v2. Proposition 36 of Book 3\nof Euclid entails that in this limit PR2 is equal to the\nproduct of QR and twice the radius SP, and hence the force for uniform\nmotion in a circle varies as v2/SP or\n v2/r.[35]\n\n\nNewton's Proposition 6 generalizes this result to not necessarily\nuniform motion under centripetal forces along an arbitrary\ntrajectory in which equal areas are swept out in equal times with\nrespect to S, in accord with Proposition 1 of Book 1. The central\nforce at P is again proportional to the displacement from the tangent\nQR over a short increment of time divided by the square of this time;\nbut now the time is proportional not to the arc PQ, but to the area\nswept out, which in the limit as Q approaches P, is the triangular area\nSPxQT/2. Therefore, to keep a body moving along a given\nnon-circular trajectory, the centripetal force must vary along the\ntrajectory as (1/SP2) \u2014 that is, 1/r2\n\u2014 times the limit of (QR/QT2) as Q approaches P. In\nthe second edition Newton adds a corollary that displays another way of\nseeing the result as a generalization of uniform circular motion: the\ncentripetal force along the trajectory must everywhere vary as\nv2/(\u03c1sinSPR), where \u03c1 is\nthe radius of curvature of the trajectory at P. With this, the\nbody can be viewed as driven from one instantaneous circle to the next\nby the component of force tangential to the motion, a component that\ndisappears in the case of uniform circular motion.\n\n\nNewton illustrates the value of Proposition 6 with a series of\nexamples, the two most important of which involve motion in an\nellipse. If the force center is at a focus S of the ellipse, then\nthe limit of (QR/QT2) is everywhere equal to half the\nconstant latus rectum of the ellipse, and hence the force varies as\n1/SP2, or 1/r2. But if the force\ncenter is at the center C of the ellipse, the force turns out to vary\nas PC, that is, linearly with r. This contrast raises an\ninteresting question. What conclusion can be drawn in the case of\nmotion in an ellipse for which the foci are very near the center, and\nthe center of force is not known to be exactly at the focus?\nNewton clearly noticed this question and supplied the means for\nanswering it in the Scholium that ends Section 2.\n\n\nSection 10 includes a philosophically important result that has gone\nlargely unnoticed in the literature on the Principia.\nNewton's argument that terrestrial gravity extends to the Moon depends\ncrucially on Huygens's precise measurement of the strength of surface\ngravity. This theory-mediated measurement was based on\nthe\n isochronism[36]\nof the cycloidal pendulum under uniform gravity directed in parallel\nlines toward a flat Earth. But gravity is directed toward the\ncenter of the (nearly) spherical Earth along lines that are not\nparallel to one another, and according to Newton's theory it is not\nuniform. So, does Huygens's measurement cease to be valid in the\ncontext of the Principia? Newton recognized this concern\nand addressed it in Propositions 48 through 52 by extending Huygens's\ntheory of the cycloidal pendulum to cover the hypocycloidal pendulum \u2014\nthat is, a cycloidal path produced when the generating circle rolls\nalong the inside of a sphere instead of along a flat surface.\nProposition 52 then shows that such a pendulum, although not\nisochronous under inverse-square centripetal forces, is isochronous\nunder centripetal forces that vary linearly with the distance to the\ncenter. Insofar as gravity varies thus linearly below the surface\nin a uniformly dense sphere, the hypocycloidal pendulum is isochronous\nup to the surface, and hence it can in principle be used to measure the\nstrength of gravity. A corollary to this proposition goes further\nby pointing out that, as the radius of the sphere is increased\nindefinitely, its surface approaches a plane surface and the law of the\nhypocycloidal asymptotically approaches Huygens's law of the cycloidal\npendulum. This not only validates Huygens's measurement of\nsurface gravity, but also provides a formula that can be used to\ndetermine the error associated with using Huygens's theory rather than\nthe theory of the hypocycloidal pendulum.\n\n\nThus, what Newton has taken the trouble to do in Section 10 is to show\nthat Huygens's theory of pendulums under uniform parallel gravity is a\nlimit-case of Newton's theory of pendulums under universal\ngravity. At the end of Section 2 he points out in passing that\nthis limit strategy also captures Galileo's theory of projectile\nmotion. In other words, Newton took the trouble to show that the\nGalilean-Huygensian theory of local motion under their uniform gravity\nis a particular limit-case of his theory of universal gravity, just as\nEinstein took the trouble to show that Newtonian gravity is a\nlimit-case of the theory of gravity of general relativity.\nNewton's main reason for doing this appears to have been the need to\nvalidate a measurement pivotal to the evidential reasoning for\nuniversal gravity in Book 3. From a philosophic standpoint,\nhowever, what is striking is not merely his recognizing this need, but\nmore so the trouble he went to to fulfill it. Section 10 may thus\nillustrate best of all that Newton had a clear reason for including\neverything he chose to include in the Principia.\n\n\nSection 9 includes another often overlooked result that is pivotal to\nthe evidential reasoning for universal gravity in Book 3.\nProposition 45 applies the result on precessing orbits mentioned\nearlier to the special case of nearly circular orbits, that is, orbits\nlike those of the then known planets and their satellites. This\nproposition establishes that such orbits, under purely centripetal\nforces, are stationary \u2014 that is, do not precess \u2014 if and only if the\ncentripetal force governing them is exactly\ninverse-square. It does this by deriving a formula relating the\nexponent n in the force law to the angle \u03b8\nbetween the point where the orbiting body is furthest from the force\ncenter to the point where it is nearest, that is, the apsidal angle:\nn = (180/\u03b8)2-3. (To\nillustrate, if the apsidal angle is 180 degrees, as in a Keplerian\nellipse, then the exponent in the force law is -2, and if the apsidal\nangle is 90 degrees, as in an ellipse for which the force center is in\nthe center, the exponent is +1.) This result is striking in three\nways. First, insofar as the cumulative effect of even a very\nsmall precession is detectable after several revolutions, this formula\nturns the rate of precession (2\u03b8 per revolution) into a\nsensitive measure of the exponent in the force law. Second, it\nyields a conditional beyond \u201cIf the orbit is stationary, then the\ncentripetal force is inverse-square,\u201d namely, \u201cIf the orbit is\nnearly stationary, then the centripetal force is nearly\ninverse-square.\u201d Using Newton's preferred phrasing, quam\nproxime (literally, \u201cmost nearly as possible\u201d), this latter\nconditional has an \u201cIf\u2026quam proxime,\nthen\u2026quam proxime\u201d form. Newton illustrates this\nby taking the mean precession rate of the lunar orbit, 3 degrees per\nrevolution, to conclude that the exponent for the net centrifugal force\nacting on the Moon is -2 and 4/243. Third, even when an orbit does\nprecess, once such a fractional departure of the exponent from -2 is\nshown to result from the perturbing effect of outside bodies, then one\ncan still conclude that the force toward the central body is exactly\n-2. This is precisely the strategy Newton follows in concluding\nthat the centripetal force on the Moon, once a correction is made for\nthe perturbing effects of the Sun, is inverse-square.\n\n\nThis is not the only place in Book 1 where Newton takes the trouble to\nderive an \u201cIf\u2026quam proxime, then\u2026quam\nproxime\u201d version of an exact \u201cIf\u2026, then\u2026\u201d\nproposition. Propositions 1 and 2 establish that a motion is\ngoverned purely by centripetal forces if and only if equal areas are\nswept out in equal times. The second and third corollaries of\nProposition 3 then yield the conclusion that a motion is quam\nproxime governed purely by centripetal forces if and only if equal\nareas are quam proxime swept out in equal times. Again,\nafter establishing that Kepler's 3/2 power rule holds exactly for\nconcentric uniform circular motions if and only if an exact\ninverse-square centripetal force holds across all the orbits, he adds\nthe generalization, \u201cAnd universally, if the periodic time is as any\npower Rn of the radius R, \u2026 the\ncentripetal force will be inversely as the power\nR2n-1 of the radius,\nand\n conversely.\u201d[37]\nThis result holds for non-integer\nvalues of n, and hence it yields the further result that the\n3/2 power rule holds quam proxime for uniform circular orbits\nif and only if the centripetal force is quam proxime\ninverse-square. These propositions\u2014 which Newton has taken the\ntrouble to show still hold in a quam proxime form \u2014 are the\nvery ones he invokes in Book 3 to conclude that the forces retaining\nbodies in their orbits in our planetary system are all centripetal and\ninverse-square. (By contrast, as noted earlier, while the\nproposition, \u201cif a Keplerian ellipse exactly, then inverse-square\nexactly,\u201d is true, the proposition, \u201cif a Keplerian ellipse quam\nproxime, then inverse-square quam proxime,\u201d is not true\nwhen the eccentricity of the ellipse is not large, as explained in\nSmith, 2002.) A failure to notice these quam proxime\nforms in Book 1 blinds one to the subtlety of the approximative\nreasoning Newton employs in Book 3.\n",
