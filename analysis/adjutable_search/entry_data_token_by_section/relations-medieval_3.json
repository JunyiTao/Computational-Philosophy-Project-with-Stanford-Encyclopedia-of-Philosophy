Relations in Medieval Philosophy\n\n\nAs we have seen, Aristotle begins his discussion of relations in the\nCategories with the assumption that relations are a certain\ntype of accident, and then inquires after their proper\ncharacterization, eventually arriving at the view that they are a\nproper subset of the entities signified by relative\nterms\u2014namely, all and only those that actually serve to relate\ntwo or more things.  Medieval philosophers tend to reverse Aristotle\u2019s\napproach, beginning where he ends. That is to say, they tend to start\ntheir discussion with the view that relations are entities that are\nboth signified by relative terms and play a certain metaphysical\nrole, and then proceed to ask about the precise nature and\nontological status of these entities\u2014in particular whether they must,\nin every case, be identified with Aristotelian accidents. There are at\nleast two reasons for this reversal. First, the medievals see nothing\nin Aristotle\u2019s preferred characterization of relations that requires\nrelations to be accidents (or indeed, entities of any ontological\ntype). Second, and perhaps more importantly, the medievals think that\nthere are certain situations that require relations to be something\nother than accidents (more on this in Section 5 below).\n",
