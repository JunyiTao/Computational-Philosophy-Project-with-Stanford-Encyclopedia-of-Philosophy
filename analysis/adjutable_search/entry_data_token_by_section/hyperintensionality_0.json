    "main_text": "The Variety of Hyperintensional Phenomena\n1. The Variety of Hyperintensional Phenomena\n\nWe provide a taxonomy of candidate hyperintensional notions by\ndividing them into two camps: (1) representational concepts\npertain to ways of representing the world (1a) in thought and (1b) in\nlanguage. In the former sub-camp (1a), we find mental states or\nactivities like believing, knowing, imagining, conceiving,\nbeing or becoming informed. In the latter sub-camp\n(1b), notions such as meaning, content, and\nconditionality. (2) Non-representational\nhyperintensional concepts include allegedly mind-independent,\n\u201cworldly\u201d notions such as essence, grounding,\nmetaphysical dependence, explanation.\n\n(The division is not uncontroversial, e.g., some claim that\nexplanation and indicative conditionals essentially involve cognition\n(Lycan 2001), so they would place them in (1a). Some claim that there\nexists \u201cenvironmental\u201d information (Barwise & Seligman\n1997) that should go into (2). We stick to what we take to be\nmainstream views on where such concepts should go.)\n\nFor each of these notions, we provide (a) a brief explanation of how\nthey have been dealt with in SPWS; and (b) examples illustrating their\nseemingly hyperintensional nature. These, if found persuasive, may\nwork as data against which the theories described in\n Section 4\n can be evaluated with respect to their hyperintensional aims.\n",
