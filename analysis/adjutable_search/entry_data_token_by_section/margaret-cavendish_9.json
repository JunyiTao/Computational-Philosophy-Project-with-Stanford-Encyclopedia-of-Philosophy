    "main_text": "Fancies\n10. Conclusion\n\nCavendish\u2019s philosophical work was not taken very seriously in the\nseventeenth century, but it is certainly relevant today. She is\npresumably right to warn about the inconsistency in insisting that God\nis utterly transcendent while being utterly confident in putting\nforward claims about His nature. She has also anticipated a\ncontemporary emphasis on the study of the brain and body in addressing\nmental health. In addition, she has made a contribution to the current\ndebate about how to understand the relation between the most basic\nelements of body and the mental activity that is manifested in human\nbeings and other organisms (Strawson 2008; McGinn 1999, 6\u201318;\nChalmers 1996, 3\u20136; and Nagel 1974, 435\u2013450). She is also\nimportant insofar as she anticipates the arguments and views of early\nmodern thinkers who are firmly in the canon and who already secure a\ngreat deal of attention. Finally, she offers extremely compelling\ninsights into issues of agency and authority. She argues that one of\nthe reasons why an individual is often unsuccessful in embodying a\nlife with which they identify is that, even if everything is in order\non the side of their decisions and talents and skills, there is often\nsocial and political corrosion in the interface between their\ndecisions and the world.\n",
