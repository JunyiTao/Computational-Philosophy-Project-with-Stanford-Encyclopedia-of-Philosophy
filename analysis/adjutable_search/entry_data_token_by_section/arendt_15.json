    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Judgment || Judgment and Validity\n5.6 Judgment and Validity\n\n\nThe representative character of judgment and opinion has important\nimplications for the question of validity. Arendt always stressed that\nthe formation of valid opinions requires a public space where\nindividuals can test and purify their views through a process of\nmutual debate and enlightenment. She was, however, quite opposed to\nthe idea that opinions should be measured by the standard of truth, or\nthat debate should be conducted according to strict scientific\nstandards of validity. In her view, truth belongs to the realm of\ncognition, the realm of logic, mathematics and the strict sciences,\nand carries always an element of coercion, since it precludes debate\nand must be accepted by every individual in possession of her rational\nfaculties. Set against the plurality of opinions, truth has a despotic\ncharacter: it compels universal assent, leaves the mind little freedom\nof movement, eliminates the diversity of views and reduces the\nrichness of human discourse. In this respect, truth is anti-political,\nsince by eliminating debate and diversity it eliminates the very\nprinciples of political life. As Arendt writes, \u201cThe trouble is\nthat factual truth, like all other truth, peremptorily claims to be\nacknowledged and precludes debate, and debate constitutes the very\nessence of political life. The modes of thought and communication that\ndeal with truth, if seen from the political perspective, are\nnecessarily domineering; they don\u2019t take into account other people\u2019s\nopinions, and taking these into account is the hallmark of all\nstrictly political thinking\u201d (BPF, 241).\n\n\nArendt\u2019s defense of opinion is motivated not just by her belief that\ntruth leaves no room for debate or dissent, or for the acknowledgment\nof difference, but also by her conviction that our reasoning faculties\ncan only flourish in a dialogic context. She cites Kant\u2019s remark that\n\u201cthe external power that deprives man of the freedom to\ncommunicate his thoughts publicly deprives him at the same time of his\nfreedom to think,\u201d and underlines the fact that for Kant the\nonly guarantee of the correctness of our thinking is that \u201cwe\nthink, as it were, in community with others to whom we communicate our\nthoughts as they communicate theirs to us\u201d (BPF, 234\u20135). She\nalso quotes Madison\u2019s statement that \u201cthe reason of man, like\nman himself, is timid and cautious when left alone, and acquires\nfirmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is\nassociated\u201d (BPF, 234).\n\n\nThe appeal to Kant and Madison is meant to vindicate the power and\ndignity of opinion against those thinkers, from Plato to Hobbes, who\nsaw it as mere illusion, as a confused or inadequate grasp of the\ntruth. For Arendt opinion is not a defective form of knowledge that\nshould be transcended or left behind as soon as one is in possession\nof the truth. Rather, it is a distinct form of knowledge which arises\nout of the collective deliberation of citizens, and which requires the\nuse of the imagination and the capacity to think\n\u201crepresentatively.\u201d By deliberating in common and engaging\nin \u201crepresentative thinking\u201d citizens are in fact able to\nform opinions that can claim intersubjective validity. It is important\nto stress that Arendt does not want to dismiss the philosophers\u2019\nattempt to find universal or absolute standards of knowledge and\ncognition, but to check their desire to impose those standards upon\nthe sphere of human affairs, since they would eliminate its plurality\nand essential relativity. The imposition of a single or absolute\nstandard into the domain of praxis would do away with the\nneed to persuade others of the relative merits of an opinion, to\nelicit their consent to a specific proposal, or to obtain their\nagreement with respect to a particular policy. Indeed, for Arendt the\nimposition of such a standard would mean that individuals would no\nlonger be required to exercise their judgment, develop their\nimagination, or cultivate an \u201cenlarged mentality,\u201d since\nthey would no longer need to deliberate in common. Strict\ndemonstration, rather than persuasive argumentation, would then become\nthe only legitimate form of discourse.\n\n\nNow, we must be careful not to impute to Arendt the view that truth\nhas no legitimate role to play in politics or in the sphere of human\naffairs. She does indeed assert that \u201cAll truths \u2014 not\nonly the various kinds of rational truth but also factual truth\n\u2014 are opposed to opinion in their mode of asserting\nvalidity\u201d (BPF, 239), since they all carry an element of\ncompulsion. However, she is only preoccupied with the negative\nconsequences of rational truth when applied to the sphere of politics\nand collective deliberation, while she defends the importance of\nfactual truth for the preservation of an accurate account of the past\nand for the very existence of political communities. Factual truth,\nshe writes, \u201cis always related to other people: it concerns\nevents and circumstances in which many are involved; it is established\nby witnesses and depends upon testimony \u2026 It is political by\nnature.\u201d It follows, therefore, that \u201cfacts and opinions,\nthough they must be kept apart, are not antagonistic to each other;\nthey belong to the same realm. Facts inform opinions, and opinions,\ninspired by different interests and passions, can differ widely and\nstill be legitimate as long as they respect factual truth. Freedom of\nopinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed and the\nfacts themselves are not in dispute. In other words, factual truth\ninforms political thought just as rational truth informs philosophical\nspeculation\u201d (BPF, 238).\n\n\nThe relationship between facts and opinions is thus one of mutual\nentailment: if opinions were not based on correct information and the\nfree access to all relevant facts they could scarcely claim any\nvalidity. And if they were to be based on fantasy, self-deception, or\ndeliberate falsehood, then no possibility of genuine debate and\nargumentation could be sustained. Both factual truth and the general\nhabit of truth-telling are therefore basic to the formation of sound\nopinions and to the flourishing of political debate. Moreover, if the\nrecord of the past were to be destroyed by organized lying, or be\ndistorted by an attempt to rewrite history, political life would be\ndeprived of one of its essential and stabilizing elements. In sum,\nboth factual truth and the practice of truth-telling are essential to\npolitical life. The antagonism for Arendt is between rational\ntruth and well-grounded opinion, since the former does not allow for\ndebate and dissent, while the latter thrives on it. Arendt\u2019s defense\nof opinion must therefore be understood as a defense of political\ndeliberation, and of the role that persuasion and dissuasion play in\nall matters affecting the political community. Against Plato and\nHobbes, who denigrated the role of opinion in political matters,\nArendt reasserts the value and importance of political discourse, of\ndeliberation and persuasion, and thus of a politics that acknowledges\ndifference and the plurality of opinions.\n",
