    "main_text": "Critiques of Nishida\u2019s Philosophy\n11. Nishida\u2019s Influence\n\n\nNishida is often called the father of the Kyoto School of philosophy\nbecause of his influence on a group of thinkers who were his students\nor younger colleagues. Best known outside Japan are his colleague and\ncritic, Tanabe Hajime, frequently considered the School\u2019s co-founder,\nand his student Nishitani Keiji. As a \u201cschool\u201d the group\ncomprises a rather fuzzy set that includes Marxist-leaning former\nstudents such as Miki Kiyoshi and Tosaka Jun, more nationalistic\nstudents like K\u014dyama Iwao and K\u014dsaka Masaaki, and lesser\nknown but close disciples like Mutai Risaku and Shimomura\nToratar\u014d. Other colleagues, students and friends on the fringes of the\nSchool proper nevertheless show the impact of Nishida\u2019s ideas: the Zen\nBuddhist scholar-teachers D. T. Suzuki and Hisamatsu Shin\u2019ichi, the\nethical theorist Watsuji Tetsur\u014d, and Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d, the\ninterpreter of Japanese aesthetics and culture. A third generation of\nthe School includes Tanabe\u2019s student Takeuchi Yoshinori, Nishitani\u2019s\nstudent Ueda Shizuteru and Hisamatsu\u2019s student Abe Masao, who have\nbeen especially effective in introducing Nishida\u2019s philosophy in\nEurope and North America and in applying Nishida\u2019s thought to\ninter-religious Buddhist-Christian dialogue.\n\n\nNishida\u2019s investigations inspired current\ninterpretations of Mahayana Buddhism, just as his thought was influenced\nby Buddhist ideas. For many people, his explication of pure\nexperience and self-awareness re-interprets Zen awakening; his\nintertwining of self and world develops the Buddhist teaching of\nco-dependent origination; and his philosophy of nothingness\narticulates the notion of emptiness and the experience of mu\n(nothing). His philosophy has also presented to his Buddhist and\nChristian readers serious challenges, such as a notion of a non-dual\nrelation between God and man, and an emphasis, unusual in Buddhism, on\nthe embodied self in the historical world. \n Nishida\u2019s logic of place has been a resource for theoreticians\nworking in various scientific fields, for example Imanishi Kinji in\nbiology and ecology, Shimizu Hiroshi in complexity theory and\ninformation science, Nonaka Ikujiro in management theory, and Ko Hojo\nin the philosophy of chemistry. The architect Ando Tadao, and artists\nlike the calligrapher Morita Shiry\u016b have also drawn from\nNishida\u2019s philosophy, as has the psychotherapist Kimura Bin.\nUltimately, Nishida himself is best considered an independent thinker,\nas the growing literature in Japanese and Western languages\nattests.\n",
