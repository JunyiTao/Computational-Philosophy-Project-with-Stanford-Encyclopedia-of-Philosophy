    "main_text": "The Moving Spotlight Theory\n9. The Moving Spotlight Theory\n\nAbove we mentioned that a metaphor sometimes used to characterize the\nDynamic Theory is that of a moving spotlight that slides along the\ntemporal dimension and that is such that only objects within the\nspotlight exist. A similar sort of metaphor can also be used to\ncharacterize the Moving Spotlight Theory, which is an interesting\nhybrid of the Static Theory and the Dynamic Theory. Like the Static\nTheory, the Moving Spotlight Theory incorporates the idea of spacetime\nas a unified manifold, with objects spread out along the temporal\ndimension in virtue of having different temporal parts at different\ntimes, and with past, present, and future parts of the manifold all\nequally real. But like the Dynamic Theory, it incorporates the thesis\nthat A-properties are objective and irreducible properties, as well as\nthe idea that time genuinely passes. The metaphor that characterizes\nthe Moving Spotlight Theory is one on which there is a moving\nspotlight that slides along the temporal dimension and that is such\nthat only things that are within the spotlight are present (but things\nthat are outside the spotlight still exist).\n\nThus the Moving Spotlight Theory is an example of an eternalist\nA-theory that subscribes to the dynamic thesis. Unlike presentist or\ngrowing block theories, spotlighters deny that any objects come into\nor out of existence. Unlike the B-theories, however, spotlighters\nthink that there is an important kind of change that cannot be\ndescribed just as mere variation in a spacetime manifold. Spotlighters\nthink instead that there is a spacetime manifold, but one particular\nregion of the manifold is objectively distinguished\u2014the present.\nAnd this distinction is only temporary\u2014facts about which region\nof spacetime count as the present change over time. For example, right\nnow a region of 2019 is distinguished as present. But in a year, a\nregion of 2020 will enjoy this honor. The term \u201cmoving spotlight\ntheory\u201d was coined by C.D. Broad\u2014himself a growing\nblocker\u2014because he thought this view of time treated passage on\nthe metaphor of a policeman\u2019s \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d\nscanning regions in sequence and focusing attention on their\ncontents.\n\nJust as there are different understandings of presentism and\neternalism, there are different versions of the moving spotlight\ntheory. Some versions think that even though the present is\ndistinguished, there is still an important sense in which the past and\nfuture are concrete. Other versions (like Cameron 2015) treat the\nspotlight theory more like a variant of presentism\u2014past and\nfuture objects still exist, but their intrinsic properties are\nradically unlike those of present objects. Fragmentalists (see Fine\n2005) think that there is a spacetime manifold but that every point in\nthe manifold has its own type of objective presentness, which defines\na past and future relative to the point.\n\nWhy be a spotlighter? Advocates think it combines some of the best\nfeatures of eternalism while still making sense of how we seem to\nperceive a world of substantive passage. It also inherits some of the\ncounterintuitive consequences of eternalism (i.e., believing dinosaurs\nstill exist) and the more complicated logic of the A-theories (i.e.,\nit requires rules for reasoning about tensed propositions involving\nthe spotlight).\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Broad 1923; Cameron\n2015; Fine 2005; Hawley 2004 [2020]; Lewis 1986 (especially Chapter\n4.2); Sider 2001; Skow 2015; Thomson 1983; Van Inwagen 1990; Zimmerman\n1998.\n",
