    "main_text": "Object Theory \u2014 Ontology beyond Being and Non-Being || Facts and Truths\n5.6 Facts and Truths\n\nObjectives, the objects of thinking, are ideal, not real objects. They\nmay have being or not, but they cannot exist at all. Like all other\n(possible) ideal objects, they can merely subsist. Concrete\noccurrences, however, can exist. They are therefore real and must be\ndistinguished from the objectives, which are ideal. An objective which\nsubsists can be called factual \u2014 it is a fact\n[Tatsache]. Nonfactual objectives (nonfacts,\n[Untatsachen]) do not subsist and are thus objects beyond\nbeing. \u201cTrue\u201d in its subjective sense is a relative\npredicate as it can be attributed only to subsistent objectives in so\nfar as they are apprehended by thoughts (judgements or assumptions).\nIn an analogous way one can also attribute truth to thoughts in so far\nas they present subsistent objectives (facts). \u201cTruth\u201d in\nits objective sense, however, simply means a subsistent objective, a\nfact. Hence Meinong\u2019s truth theory is a borderline case of a\ncorrespondence theory; it is an identity theory of truth (1915,\n\u00a77; 1910, \u00a713). The relation of possibility to probability\ncorresponds to the relation of factuality to truth. Possibility is\nobjective and absolute, whereas probability is in a way subjective and\nrelative. What is nowadays called \u201cobjective probability\u201d,\nMeinong calls \u201cpossibility\u201d (\u201cdegrees of\npossibility\u201d).\n",
