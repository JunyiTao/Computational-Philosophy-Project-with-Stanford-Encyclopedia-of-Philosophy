    "main_text": "The Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t (Quatrains) || Theodicy and Justice\n3.2 Theodicy and Justice \nThe problem of suffering has an ominous presence in the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, which contains both Epicurean and Stoic themes. On theodicy, Khayyam remarks:\n\nIn what life yields in this Two-door monastery\nYour share in the pain of heart and death will tarry\nThe one who does not bear a child is happy\nAnd he not born of a mother, merry\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\nAnd also:\n\nLife is dark and maze-like, it is\nSuffering cast upon us and comfort in abyss\nPraise the Lord for all the means of evil\nAsk none other than He for malice\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (translation by Aminrazavi)\n\n(It is an irony that while Khayyam complains about theodicy and human suffering throughout his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, in his philosophical works he offers a treatise almost entirely devoted to a philosophical justification of the problem of evil.) It might seem that theodicy as a theological and philosophical problem in Islam never received the attention it did in Western intellectual tradition; however, a series of problems associated with evil have been discussed under different names in this tradition. In the discussion of Taw\u1e25\u012bd, absolute oneness and unity of God in Islam, the problem of existence of evil, particularly the manner in which evil is created by God, is discussed (see section 2.4 above). In the debate over God\u2019s attribute of justice, between the Asharites and the Mu\u02bftazilites, some aspects of the problem of evil, e.g., whether our morally wrong actions are ultimately created by God or attributed to him, are carefully examined as well. Also, in the discussion of relative and negative (privative) attributes, the question of the nature of evil is raised again. Khayyam\u2019s poem seems to acknowledge both the reality and malicious nature of evil and the ensuing suffering, on the one hand, and God\u2019s role in allowing evil and his \u201canswerability,\u201d on the other hand. This makes questioning God on the existence of evil not illegitimate: \u201cAsk none other than He for malice.\u201d\n",
