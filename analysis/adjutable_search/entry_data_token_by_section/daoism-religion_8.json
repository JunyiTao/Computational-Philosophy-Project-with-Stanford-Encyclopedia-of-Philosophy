    "main_text": "Origins of Daoist Religion || The Divinization of Laozi\n2.5 The Divinization of Laozi\n\nIn addition to the components outlined above, the process that, in the\nsecond half of the 2nd century CE, led to the formation of\nthe first major Daoist religious movement (see\n \u00a73.1)\n could not be understood without paying attention to the political\nideologies of ancient China. These ideologies are synthesized in the\nconcept of the Great Peace (taiping), which was shared by\ndifferent traditions including Confucianism (Seidel 1983b; Espesset\n2009). With regard to Daoism, the main source that documents these\nviews is the Taiping jing (Book of the Great Peace),\noriginally dating from the 1st or the 2nd\ncenturies CE (Hendrischke 2006). The central idea in the Taiping\njing is the advent of an era of \u201cpeace\u201d\n(ping, also meaning \u201cequity\u201d) in which a perfect\nruler would establish a perfect society. This era would follow\ncalamities designed to eliminate the corrupted ones, but would come\nonly if the ruler governs according to the principle of\n\u201creturning to the Dao\u201d.\n\nThe views of the Taiping jing are the first important example of\nChinese millenarianism, which would become a further major theme in\nthe Daoist tradition from the 2nd until at least the\n7th centuries (Mollier 2008b). Amid the social tumults and\nthe natural calamities that marked the last part of the Han rule,\nexpectations and prophecies of a forthcoming messiah\u2014often\npredicted to be surnamed Li\u2014grew during the 2nd\ncentury of our era (Seidel 1969\u201370 and 1983b).\n\nThat savior turned out to be Laozi himself\u2014one of whose names was Li\nEr\u2014who became a deity under the name of Laojun, or Lord Lao (Seidel\n1969). In 165 and 166, rites were celebrated in Huxian, Laozi\u2019s\nsupposed birthplace; and in 166, Emperor Huan (r. 147\u2013168)\nperformed\u2014for the first and only time in Chinese history\u2014a\nceremony in his honor in the imperial palace. However, the deification\nprocess may have begun even earlier, and the possibility that the\n\u201csecular\u201d Laozi was already the object of cults is\nsuggested by one of the main sources on his deification, namely the Laozi\nming (Inscription for Laozi; Seidel 1969: 43\u201350 and\n121\u201328; Csikszentmihalyi 2006: 105\u201312). This work, written on the\noccasion of Emperor Huan\u2019s ceremony, contains a biography of\nLaozi, an account of the events that led Huan to perform the rite, and\na poetical eulogy of Laozi as a saint who follows the doctrines of\n\u201cnon-doing\u201d and eliminating desires. Significantly, in\nthis source Laozi is not yet called \u201cgod\u201d (shen)\nand not even \u201clord\u201d (jun).\n\nThe Laozi bianhua jing (Book of the Transformations of\nLaozi), dating from the late 2nd century and possibly\noriginating from a popular cult in Sichuan (Seidel 1969: 59\u201375),\nenjoins recitation of the Daode jing and confession of sins,\nand is the first of several works that mention one of the main\nfeatures of Laozi as a deity: in addition to personifying the Dao and\nto being a model of the Daoist sage, Lord Lao periodically descends to\nearth in order to bestow teachings to humanity and especially to\nrulers. This has two important consequences. First, from this time\nonwards the Dao takes an active role in the human world, either\nthrough its divine emissaries or by granting revelations to certain\nadepts. Second, the \u201chistorical\u201d Laozi\u2014the author of\nthe Daode jing\u2014is only one of the different forms that\nLord Lao has taken in order to guide humanity.\n\n",
