    "main_text": "Ethics and Information Technology || The Politics of Information Technology and a Disclosive Ethics\n3.2 The Politics of Information Technology and a Disclosive Ethics\n\nThe constructivist view of the information technology/society\nrelationship (discussed in\n section 1.2\n above) tends to lead to a different kind of reflection on the ethical\nsignificance of information technology. They suggest that the problem\nwith the tool and impact view of society/technology relations is that\nit assumes that the domain of society is where the ends (values,\nassumptions and politics) are located and that the domain of the\ntechnical is merely neutral means towards these ends. This view is\noften expressed in the slogan \u2018guns do not kill people, people\ndo\u2019, meaning guns are merely a means to an end (which could be\npeaceful or violent depending on the user of the gun). In contrast\nsocial constructivists tend to argue that technology, as socially\nconstructed, is already political as such and therefore already\nsuggests an ethical concern. By this they mean that technology, by its\nvery design, includes certain interests and excludes others. This does\nnot mean that designers are always aware that they are making\npolitical and ethical decisions. In fact they are mostly not. They are\nmostly trying to solve very mundane everyday \u2018technical\u2019\nproblems when they build technologies. Nevertheless, they always make\nassumptions or take for granted certain values and beliefs (mostly\ntheir own) when they construct artifacts. For example the ATM bank\nmachine assumes a particular person in front of it. It assumes a\nperson that is able to see the screen, read it, remember and enter a\npersonal identification (PIN) code, etc. It is not difficult to\nimagine a whole section of society that does not conform to this\nassumption. If you are blind, in a wheelchair, have problems\nremembering, or are unable to enter a PIN, because of a disability,\nthen your interest in getting access to your account will be excluded\nby the actual design of the ATM. In this way the ATM embodies a\nparticular understanding of the world (humans) in front of it. This is\nwhy Langdon Winner (1980) argued that artifacts (and technological\nsystems) always already embody interests, values, etc.\u2014that is\nto say, they are always political from the start. This does not mean\nthat users cannot intentionally or unintentionally reinterpret the way\ntechnology suggests or \u2018affords\u2019 possibilities to suit\ntheir own needs. Users often \u2018read\u2019 and use technology in\nways unintended by the designers/implementers. However, as these\ntechnological affordances become embedded in larger infrastructures\n(practices, systems, spaces, organizations, etc.) it becomes\nincreasingly difficult to use the technology in ways other than in the\nway it was set up to afford possibilities (or not).\n\nIf information technology is political\u2014i.e., it already\nincludes/excludes certain interests\u2014then it is also immediately\nethical. For the constructivist it is the particular way in which\ninterests become built into the technology and practices within which\nit is embedded that is ethically significant (Brey 2000, 2004, 2006).\nMoreover, they often argue that ethical reflection should be an\ninherent part of the design process\u2014referred to as value\nsensitive design (Friedman 1997). Of particular concern is the way\ninformation technology \u2018hides\u2019 these values and interests\nin the logic of software algorithms and hardware circuits (Introna\n& Nissenbaum, 2000). Everyday technologies such as utensils are\nmostly open to scrutiny by the reflexive user. Information technology,\non the other hand, is mostly not open to such scrutiny (Brey 2000).\nImportant assumptions and biases in information technology are mostly\nobscured and subsumed in \u2018black-boxes\u2019 in ways that make\nit difficult even for the experts to scrutinize them. It is not\npossible for the ordinary computer user to scrutinize the assumptions\nand biases embedded in the code of the Microsoft Windows operating\nsystem. Imbedded in the software and hardware code of information\ntechnology applications are complex rules of logic and categorization\nthat may have material consequences for those using them, and for the\nproduction of social order more generally (Introna & Wood 2004,\nIntrona & Nissenbaum 2000). In this view of information technology\nethics, the task of ethics is to open up the \u2018black box\u2019\nof information technology and reveal or disclose the values\nand interests it embodies for scrutiny and reflection\u2014not only\nin its final design but also in the process of development (Introna\n2007). Such an approach to the ethics of information technology is\nmost often informed by technology studies within the science,\ntechnology and society (STS) tradition as proposed by Bijker\n(2003)\n",
