    "main_text": "The 16th Century: Scholasticism\n4. The 16th Century: Scholasticism\n\nBecause the Spanish Empire was characterized by its Catholic zeal, it\ndid not allow Protestant, pagan, or \u201cmodern\u201d philosophies\nto be studied in New Spain. Instead, Scholasticism was the only school\nof philosophy that was approved by colonial authorities and the\nCatholic Church. Nevertheless, a number of prominent philosophers in\nMexico made lasting and original contributions to the Scholastic\ntradition.\n\nFriar Alonso de la Veracruz (1507\u20131584) was the first\nphilosopher of New Spain. A student of Vitoria, he was one of the\nfirst to teach Scholastic philosophy in the New World and was the\nfirst published philosopher of New Spain. He wrote several\ncommentaries on Aristotle, such as Recognitio summularum\n(1554a), Dialectica resolutio (1554b), and Physica\nspeculatio (1557), which were used as textbooks. Like Vitoria,\nAlonso also questioned the justification of the Conquest, but he was\neven more sympathetic toward the indigenous population. Alonso argued\nthat the natives did not lose their right to their lands because they\nwere pagans, and he claimed that the Spanish Crown had stolen them\nfrom their lawful owners. He also sustained that sovereignty\nultimately belongs to the people, not the king.\n\nThe Jesuit priest Antonio Rubio stands out among the philosophers of\nthe 16th century. Born in Spain, he established himself in\nNew Spain from 1576 to 1600 and wrote a famous treatise of logic\ntitled L\u00f3gica mexicana (1603). The University of\nAlcal\u00e1 adopted L\u00f3gica mexicana as its primary\nlogic textbook and many editions of an abridged version were printed\nin Europe. We know, for instance, that Descartes studied Rubio\u2019s\nL\u00f3gica as a pupil in La Fleche. Rubio wrote other\nbooks in which he offered a complete course in philosophy but, while\nhis works on natural philosophy were published, his work on\nmetaphysics was not, perhaps due to the popularity of Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s Disputationes metaphysicae (1597).\n\nAnother notable philosopher in New Spain from the 16th\ncentury is Tom\u00e1s Mercado, who wrote several studies on logic\nand the philosophy of economics, specifically on the rationality and\njustice of commercial trade.\n",
