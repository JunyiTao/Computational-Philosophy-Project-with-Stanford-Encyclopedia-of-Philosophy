    "main_text": "Defending the Dharma: A Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows || Distinguishing Great Vehicle from Disciples\u2019 Vows\n3.2 Distinguishing Great Vehicle from Disciples\u2019 Vows\n\n One point with which Sapa\u1e47 opens the Three Vows provides\nan elegant paradigm for what he means by the title\u2019s\n\u201cClear Differentiation\u201d of the three vows, or\n codes.[11] \nIt is a case where Tibetans of his day have \u201cmixed\u201d the\nDisciples\u2019 vows with the Great Vehicle\u2019s bodhisattva vows.\nNow, it is clear that Tibetans undertaking monastic vows had commonly\npaired the oral recitation that constitutes the adoption of monastic\nvows with a mental component, the generation of a Great Vehicle\nintention called bodhicitta\u2014the altruistic desire to\nachieve Buddhahood in order to save all beings from \n suffering.[12] \nSapa\u1e47 voices no complaint about this pairing of mental and\nphysical actions, but he rejects a mistaken conclusion about the\nduration of the vows that some of his contemporaries apparently\nderived from it.\n\nSapa\u1e47 argues that Disciples\u2019 vows (i.e., monastic vows)\nlast until death (when one\u2019s body dies), whereas the bodhisattva\nvows last beyond death, through subsequent rebirths\u2014as long as\none\u2019s mind persists. A counter-argument proposes that, if the\naltruistic intention is in place when they are recited, the\nDisciples\u2019 vows should also continue for as long as one\u2019s\nmind\n persists.[13]\n In reply, Sapa\u1e47 says that this contradicts authoritative texts\nthat distinguish between the different rites and rules for upholding\nthe Disciples\u2019 and Great Vehicle\n vows.[14]\n Furthermore, he says, if monastic vows lasted from life to life, then\ngods and babies who were reborn from the mental continua of deceased\nmonks would still be monks. Yet not only are such beings violating the\nrules of monkhood all the time, they are expressly forbidden from\nbecoming monks! Here we see a widespread mixture of practices leading\nto an unacceptable doctrinal confusion.\n\nThis may seem like a clever analysis without significant practical\nramifications. After all, I have no way of knowing whether I took a\nvow in a previous lifetime, and I cannot inform my future rebirth\nabout whether I have taken a vow in this life. But notice that the\nvows systems are distinguished by indicating the specific causes and\nresults on the path to liberation. Sapa\u1e47\u2019s basic point is\nthat Disciples\u2019 vows and Great Vehicle vows operate differently.\nThe practical benefit from such a \u201cdifferentiation\u201d, then,\nis the ability to articulate the different paths to liberation clearly\nand accurately.\n\nThis general concern with the operation of the paths leads, in the\nnext section, to a broader definition of\nkarma\u2014action-and-result\u2014and its associated terminology.\nSapa\u1e47 begins with the crucial distinction between actions, which\nare produced and bring about happiness or pain as their result, and\nthe unconditioned, actionless, Realm of Reality or Dharmadh\u0101tu.\nSince wholesomeness is a quality of an action that is determined by\nthe happiness or pain that the action causes, he says, the causeless\nDharmadh\u0101tu is neither wholesome nor unwholesome. This\nconsequentialism about wholesomeness or virtue, set against a backdrop\nof an unchanging, literally \u201cinconsequential\u201d ultimate\nreality, launches the most extensive, detailed argument of the work:\nthe argument against the ultimate reality of virtue.\n",
