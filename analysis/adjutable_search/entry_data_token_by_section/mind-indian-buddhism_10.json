    "main_text": "Consciousness and Cognition || Consciousness\n3.4 Consciousness\n\n\nThe canonical literature presents us with a standard formula for the \ndependently arising phenomenon of consciousness:\n\n\nDependent on the eye and forms, visual-consciousness arises. The\nmeeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is\nfeeling. What one feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that\none thinks about. What one thinks about, that one mentally\nproliferates. With what one has mentally proliferated as the source,\nperception and notions resulting from mental proliferation beset a man\nwith respect to past, future, and present forms cognizble through the\neye (Majjhima Nikaya, I, 111\u2013112).\n\n\n\nAs this passage illustrates, a specific type of consciousness \naccompanies each of the sensory modalities, in this case the \nexperience of visual awareness. No one element in this nexus of \ninteractions has causal priority. Rather, these associations between \nperception and thinking are due to the habitual tendency of the mind \ntowards conceptual proliferation, for as the Buddha declares in his \ndiscourses, the perceptual experience of ordinary people is replete \nwith mistaken apprehensions. Note that while sense, object, and \nconscious apprehension come together as a consequence of past \nhabituations and other conditioning factors, the ensuing cognitive \nawareness appears to both sustain and be sustained by these factors.\n\n\nNow, in the canonical literature consciousness \n(vij\u00f1\u0101na) is treated as a synonym of apperception \n(sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) [see Sutta Nipata, 538, \n806]. This lack of clear dissociation between apperception, \nunderstood here as the empirical apprehension of phenomena, and \nconsciousness as the apprehending faculty, is made obvious by \nfrequent references to sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101 as being the \ncause of attachment to agreeable physical objects and mental states. \nFurthermore, apperception is often contrasted with wisdom thus \nsuggesting that what is meant by it is not sensory activity proper \nbut rather the awareness that bears upon it. Likewise, \nvij\u00f1\u0101na does not denote consciousness as a \ncognitive phenomenon distinct from sense perception. Rather, it \nrefers to the consciousness of a specific sense modality (e.g., \nvisual-awareness, auditory-awareness). Because the mental faculty is \nalso regarded as a sensory system, the type of awareness that bears \nupon it is termed mental or \u2018introspective awareness\u2019 \n(manovij\u00f1\u0101na). The arising of consciousness, thus,\ndepends on sense perception, but it also depends on attention, since \nsensory activity alone does not give rise to perception. The latter \nactivity requires attending to the stimuli: the amorphous mass of the\nsense data gives rise to a percept only when sensation is coupled \nwith attention. In the formula of dependent arising that we encounter\nat several places in the canonical literature, consciousness is said \nto arise in dependence upon the sense and the physical object. But \nthe appearance of phenomena itself depend in turn upon this empirical\nawareness. Thus, the Buddha declares:\n\n\nMind and body condition contact. By whatever properties,\ncharacteristics, signs or indications the mind factor is to be\nconceived, in their absence...would any grasping at the idea of the\nbody factor be manifest? No, Sir...By whatever properties the mind\nfactor and the body factor are designated, in their absence...would\nany grasping at the notion of sensory reaction be manifest? No,\nSir. By whatever properties, characteristics, signs or indications the\nmind factor is conceived, in their absence is there any contact to be\nfound? No, Sir. Then, \u0100nanda, just this, namely mind and body, is\nthe root, the cause, the origin, the condition for all contact. I have\nsaid: \u2018Consciousness conditions mind and body\u2019\n(D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya II, 63, 2\u201321).\n\n\n\nPassages such as this present a metaphysical picture of mental and \npsychological individuation as arising in dependence upon the \nactivity of empirical consciousness. Consciousness, however, is not \ntreated as the direct cause for the manifestation of body, feelings \nand perceptions. Rather, the Buddhist tradition assigns this causal \nrole to the four elements. The structure is one of mutual entailment: \non the one hand, feelings, perceptions, and volitions are caused by \ncontact resulting from intentional states of cognitive awareness; on \nthe other hand, the psycho-physical aggregates in turn condition the \nmanifestation of consciousness.\n\n\nThus, the Nik\u0101yas do not offer a comprehensive picture of \nconsciousness as a distinct phenomenon, but only as something that \narises and passes away as a result of the activity of all the other \npsycho-physical elements. Its characteristic aspect is determined by \nthe sensory system with which it happens to be associated. Thus, the \ndistinctive aspect of visual consciousness is determined by the \nmakeup of the visual sense and not by any intrinsic properties of its\nown.\n\n\nThe rejection of an immutable self abiding in each individual seems \nto have undermined all attempts to analyze consciousness on its own \nterms. Even though the Sanskrit term vij\u00f1\u0101na \n(which in the Upani\u1e63ads designates consciousness as an abiding \ncharacteristic of the self) is adopted by the Buddhists as an \nappropriate designation for consciousness, the interpretations found \nin the Nik\u0101yas and the early Abhidharma deny its immutability \nand instead regard it as indistinct from perceptual cognition. At \nthis early stage in the development of a Buddhist theory of mind, \nvij\u00f1\u0101na still retains its double meaning: (1) that\nof \u2018consciousness\u2019 as a factor in the chain of \ndependently arisen phenomena that is essential for the continuity of \nthe karmic process; and (2) that of \u2018cognition\u2019, a \nfaculty that is associated with each of the five sensory modalities \nand with the mind [see Samyutta Nik\u0101ya, III, 87; \nMajjhima Nik\u0101ya, I, 292]. In later Abhidharma \ntraditions, such as those of the Sautr\u0101ntika and \nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Schools, consciousness is discussed mainly in \nrelation to the aggregates of cognition \n(vij\u00f1\u0101naskandha), which are primarily the senses \nand the mental faculty [see AKBh ad I, 16a].\n\n\nAlready in the earliest strata of the canonical literature we find a \ntripartite model of cognition in which a clear distinction is made \nbetween the phenomenal world, its mode of apprehension, and the \nspecific type of consciousness by which it is apprehended. However, \nwhat is meant by world (loka) in this context is not an \nexternal reality of physical entities and processes, but the \nphenomenal world of perception (lokasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) \nthat arises in dependence upon the proliferating activities of mind. \nThus, the notion that consciousness acts as a causal condition for \nthe appearance of phenomena, while not a direct rejection of \nexternal, mind-independent objects, does seem to anticipate the \nidealist tendencies of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra School (see \n \u00a76.3).\n \n",
