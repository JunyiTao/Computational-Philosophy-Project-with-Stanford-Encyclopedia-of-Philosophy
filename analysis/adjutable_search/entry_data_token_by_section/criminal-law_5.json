    "main_text": "Criminal Responsibility\n6. Criminal Procedure and Evidence\n\n\nImagine there are reasons to believe that \\(D\\) is criminally responsible\nfor having \\(\\phi\\)ed. What may officials of the criminal justice\nsystem do in response to those reasons? What should they do, and\nrefrain from doing?\n\n\nAs a matter of law, the answer depends on norms of criminal\nprocedure and evidence. Some of these norms confer powers and\npermissions that help officials build their case against \\(D\\). Think of\nstop and search, intrusive forms of surveillance, and pre-trial\ndetention. Other norms regulate the kinds of evidence that may be used\nagainst \\(D\\) in court. Think of hearsay, or statistical evidence, or\nevidence of \\(D\\)\u2019s bad (or good) character (Ho 2008; Redmayne 2015).\nYet other norms govern the way in which one aspect of the criminal\njustice system should respond to the misconduct of others. Imagine\nevidence against \\(D\\) was gathered illegally, or that \\(D\\) was entrapped, or\nthat \\(D\\)\u2019s case should have been discontinued according to the\nguidelines prosecutors set for themselves. Should the courts throw out\n\\(D\\)\u2019s case, even where the evidence against \\(D\\) is strong? If so, on\nwhat grounds should they do so? (Ashworth 2000; Duff et al 2007,\n225\u2013257).\n\n\nThe norms I have mentioned are somewhat neglected by philosophers of\ncriminal law. Things are different when it comes to the so-called\npresumption of innocence (PI). The most well-known judicial formulation\nof (PI) is found in Woolmington v. DPP [1935] UKHL 1:\n\n\nThroughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is\nalways to be seen \u2026 No matter what the charge or where the\ntrial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the\nprisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle\nit down can be entertained. \n\n\nSo understood, (PI) allocates the burden of proof in criminal trials\nto those on the accusing side. Many add that \\(D\\)\u2019s accusers must\nmeet an especially high standard of proof\u2014they must eliminate all\nreasonable doubt to secure a conviction. Though these points are widely\naccepted, they leave open a range of further questions about the scope\nand basis of (PI). The following remarks touch on just some (for an\noverview, see Lippke 2016).\n\n\nOne question is whether (PI) has implications for criminal procedure\nthat extend beyond the criminal trial. On one view, (PI) just\nis a norm that governs the burden and standard of proof at trial.\nOn another, (PI) is something more expansive: it is a norm that tells\ncriminal justice officials\u2014and, perhaps, the rest of us\ntoo\u2014how to interact with others, including those suspected of\ncrime (Stewart 2014, Duff 2013b). That norm of course has implications\nfor the moment of trial. But its implications extend both backwards\nand forwards from that point in time. They extend backwards to\ndecisions about whether to arrest, prosecute, or detain those\nsuspected of criminality (Ashworth 2006, 249; Duff 2013b,\n180\u2013185; Stewart 2014, 414). And they extend forwards to\ndecisions both about how much to punish (Tomlin 2014a), and about the\nappropriate collateral consequences of conviction and punishment (Duff\n2013b, 185\u2013192).\n\n\nA second question is whether (PI) has implications for the\nsubstantive criminal law. Some writers\u2014and most\ncourts\u2014think not. They give (PI) a purely procedural\ninterpretation (Roberts 2005; Lippke 2016). It has been argued,\nhowever, that all such interpretations are implausibly narrow (Tadros\n2007; 2014; Tomlin 2013). Imagine it is an offence to possess\ninformation of a kind that might be useful to terrorists, with the\nintention of committing acts of terror. Intentions like this are often\ndifficult to prove. Legislators might respond by shifting the burden of\nproof to D: they might make it the case that, once the prosecution\nproves possession, it is for \\(D\\) to prove the absence of intention. The\nWoolmington formulation suggests that this move violates (PI).\nNow imagine a creative legislature simply eliminates the requirement of\nintention from the law: it becomes a crime to possess information of a\nkind that might be useful to terrorists, whatever the\npossessor\u2019s intentions might be. Assuming that the\nprosecution must prove every element of the revised offence, this move\nbrings the law into conformity with a purely procedural (PI). Now most\nwriters\u2014and most human rights treaties\u2014consider (PI) to be\nan important right that protects criminal suspects against the state.\nExamples like the above show that the purely procedural interpretation\nhas the following implication: legislators who offer suspects\nless protection somehow better conform to the right.\nNot only is this counterintuitive, it renders the right toothless in\nthe face of legislative creativity (Tadros 2014). This is, some\nconclude, sufficient reason to reject the purely procedural (PI).\n\n\nImagine \\(D\\) is charged with a criminal offence and pleads not guilty.\nOn the purely procedural view, (PI) makes it a precondition of\nconviction and punishment that the prosecution prove \\(D\\) satisfied all\nelements of the offence. What those elements are is a separate\nquestion. Some endorse a revised view that makes (PI) more demanding.\nThese writers distinguish between elements of offences, and the wrongs\ntaken by offence-creators to justify convicting and punishing\noffenders. (PI), they claim, not only requires proof that \\(D\\) satisfied\nthe former; it also requires proof that \\(D\\) committed the latter (Tadros\n2007; 2014).\n\n\nTo see the difference this revision makes, imagine legislators make\nit an offence to possess information that might be useful to\nterrorists. An intention to commit acts of terror is no element of the\noffence as legislated. Our legislators do not, however, think that all\nthose who possess such information should be convicted and punished.\nThis, they know, would be ridiculous overkill. They think that\npossessors who intend to commit acts of terror should be convicted and\npunished. This element of intention is omitted from the offence,\nbecause omitting it makes securing convictions easier for prosecutors,\nthereby reducing the risk that those planning acts of terror will get\noff the hook. (PI), on the revised view, nonetheless requires proof of\nthe intent: ex hypothesi, it is possession with an intention\nto commit acts of terror that is taken by law-makers to justify\nconvicting and punishing offenders. To comply with (PI), criminal\ncourts must demand proof that \\(D\\) committed this wrong as a precondition\nof conviction and punishment.\n\n\nSo understood, (PI) is anything but toothless. It is often claimed,\nnowadays, that too few suspected wrongdoers are convicted of crimes,\nand that new criminal laws are needed to help secure more convictions.\nOn the revised view, legislators can create as many criminal laws as\nthey want in pursuit of this objective. But no-one who pleads not\nguilty may be convicted under them without proof that they are the\nwrongdoers they are suspected of being. That it provides anyone who\nfaces criminal charges with this kind of protection against the law,\nis what makes the case for the revised (PI).\n",
