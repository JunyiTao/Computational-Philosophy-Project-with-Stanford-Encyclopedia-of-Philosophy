    "main_text": "On Nature || Zoogony\n2.3 Zoogony\n\nSo far we have concentrated primarily on the coming to be of the\ncosmos. However, the interplay of forces and roots also explains the\ncoming to be and destruction of animals:\n\n\n\nBut they, when light mixed with aether in a human (?)\u2026\n\nOr in the race of savage beasts or of bushes \n\nOr of birds, then \u2026 to be born; \n\nBut when they are separated apart, this in turn they call\n\u201cunfortunate destiny\u201d, \n\nAs is licit (themis), and I myself too apply it [i.e., this\nterm] in the same way. (B 9 = D54) \n\n\nEmpedocles uses a striking image to illustrate how roots are mixed to\nproduce animals:\n\n\n\nAs when painters color many-hued sacrificial offerings, \n\nBoth men, by reason of their skill, very expert in their art, \n\nThey grasp many-colored pigments in their hands, \n\nThen, having mixed them in harmony, the ones more, the others less, \n\nOut of these they compose forms similar to all things, \n\nCreating trees, men, and women, \n\nWild beasts and birds, water-nourished fish, \n\nAnd long-lived gods, the greatest in honors: \n\nIn this way may your mind not succumb to the error that it is from\nelsewhere [scil. than from the four elementary roots] \n\nThat comes the source of all the innumerable mortal things whose\nexistence is evident, \n\nBut know this exactly, once you have heard the word of a god. (B 23 =\nD 60) \n\n\nAlthough this analogy seems to describe the way Love combines\ndifferent roots, as we shall see Empedocles associated zoogony with\nthe influence of both forces. We can distinguish two sets of fragments\nthat tell of the way that living beings come to be. The first set\ntells about fantastic events and creatures; the second about\nnatural-sounding events and creatures.\n\nLet us start with the fantastic. Empedocles says that there was a time\nwhen separate limbs wandered around on their own:\n\n\n\nFrom it [scil. the earth] blossomed many faces without necks, \n\nNaked arms wandered about, bereft of shoulders, \n\nAnd eyes roamed about alone, deprived of brows. (B 57 = D 157). \n\n\nThe wandering and straying suggest aimless and disorderly movements\n(and so, some influence of Strife). Then, however, these separate\nlimbs combined in random ways to make fantastic creatures:\n\n\n\nMany grew double of face and double of chest, \n\nRaces of man-prowed cattle, while others sprang up inversely, \n\nCreatures of cattle-headed men, mixed here from men, \n\nThere creatures of women fitted with shadowy genitals. (B 61 = D 156)\n\n\n\nIn these fragments there is a change from separateness to combination\nand cooperation (Sedley 2016). Combination and cooperation are, of\ncourse, the work of Love. Whether this phase also produced\nnon-fantastic creatures, e.g., ox-headed oxen, is not clear. Aristotle\nseemed to think it did, because he says some of these combinations\nwere fitted to survive (Physics. II 8, 198b29).\n\nIn the second set of fragments we find an explanation of the way that\npresent day creatures come to be. \n\n\n\nCome then: how fire, separating off, drew upward the nocturnal\nsaplings \n\nOf much-weeping men and women\u2014 \n\nHear this. For my tale is not aimless nor ignorant. \n\nFirst, complete [or: rough] outlines sprang up from the earth \n\nPossessing a share of both, of water as of heat. \n\nThese fire sent upward, wishing to reach what was similar to it; \n\nAs yet they displayed neither the lovely framework of limbs \n\nNor the voice and the organ that is native to men. (B 62 = D 157) \n\n\nThis phase produces the earliest human forms, which are autochthonous,\nand they have yet to show entirely human features. Ultimately, from\nthese there developed men and women as we know them today (B\n63\u201365 = D 164, 162, 171, 172). At this point, sexual\nreproduction becomes the focus of Empedocles\u2019 account. Still,\nthis first phase begins with separation of elements, as the first\nlines of the fragment show, and so it involves some influence of\nStrife.\n\nIt has been proposed that the move from discrete necks, arms, and eyes\nto the existing, compound bodies of humans and animals is an\nanticipation of a kind of evolution through natural selection (Sedley\n2016). That is, single-limbed organisms joined together with one\nanother to produce temporary compounds that survived on the basis of\ntheir success in the environment, and eventually came to reproduce\nthemselves.\n\nIn the traditional interpretations, these fragments describe two\nzoogonies, one under the increasingly dominant influence of Love and\nthe other under the dominant influence of Strife. So, the living\nbeings produced by the work of Love belong to the era when Love rules\nand those brought into existence by Strife belong to the era when\nStrife rules. By contrast, in the second strain of interpretation,\nthere is only one zoogony, which takes place under the increasing\ninfluence of Love, although Strife is still present. Thus, there are\nnot two zoogonies happening in distinct cosmic cycles; rather there\nare fluctuations of Love and Strife within the progress from total\ndomination by Strife to that by Love. This question has been affected\nby a surprising discovery. In 1994, at the Biblioth\u00e8que\nNationale et Universitaire of Strasbourg, a papyrus was identified as\ncontaining extensive fragments of Empedocles\u2019 poem; some of this\nmaterial was hitherto unknown to modern readers. In the wake of this\ndiscovery, some scholars have argued the newly found material added\nweight to the traditional reading. For instance, Tr\u00e9panier\n(2003) argues that ensemble d (see Martin\nand Primavesi 1999: 144\u2013149) strengthens previous evidence for a\nkind of zoogony taking place under the influence of Strife, which is\nfully distinct from the kind of zoogony under the influence of Love.\nIn turn, distinct zoogonies imply distinct cosmogonies.\n\nHowever, the double zoogony implies that animals or their parts will\ncome to be through a process of separation. Since zoogony under\nincreasing Love is shown to be a kind of assembly of parts that leads\nto viable creatures, by parity of reasoning, zoogony under increasing\nStrife should be a sundering of wholes that leads to viable creatures\nor to the sort of parts that are condemned to further disintegration.\nThe task, then, for the traditionalists is to find in the manuscript\npassages that clearly show a sundering that produces viable creatures\nor parts thereof. In turn, the sundering must clearly belong to a\nstage in which Strife is not just dominant\u2014after all, their\nopponents recognize a fluctuation in the influence of Love and\nStrife\u2014but is achieving complete separation. While the\ntraditionalists have presented passages from the manuscript that they\nclaim to be such evidence, the claims have not gone unchallenged (see\nBalaud\u00e9 2010 and Laks 2001). At this point in the continuing\nscholarly debate perhaps it is not too bold to say that the new\nmaterial presents some\u2014not uncontested\u2014evidence for a\ndouble zoogony.\n\nThe question of the sequence of these stages is, perhaps, not as\nimportant as the fact that, on any view, Empedocles is proposing a way\nof explaining living beings by competing principles of Love and\nStrife. While each of the four roots has its particular quality, these\nqualities alone are not enough to explain how a cosmos, and its\ncreatures, come to be. Besides the interaction of fire, air, earth,\nand water, there must be other forces at work in order to have the\nworld we live in. Thus, the four roots, with the particular qualities,\nare not so naturally antagonistic as to defy combination but are\ncapable both of repelling one another and of coming together. On the\none hand, a lot of our world is the effect of disintegration because\nthe roots prove to be antagonistic due to Strife; on the other, they\nalso come together by harmonizing their particular qualities due to\nLove. When harmony is a creative force, how Love achieves combination\ncomes to the fore. The explanation of harmonizing what could be\nantagonistic achieves an important depth in the idea of a proportional\nmixture of roots. Empedocles says that flesh and blood are composed of\napproximately equal parts of earth, fire, water, and aither (B 98 = D\n190). Another proportion of elements produces bone (B 96 = D 192).\nThus, a proper balance harmonizes the roots and banishes antagonism.\nHowever we read the cycles of Love and Strife, then, this harmony of\npotentially opposing roots is only a phase. In the sphere of Love, the\nproportion that produces the variety of creatures gives way to a\nhomogenizing blend of roots.\n\nThese fragments seem related to ancient medicine, with its theory of\nthe proper mixture of hot and cold, dry and wet as constituting the\nhealthy condition of the body (recall that we are told that Empedocles\nwas a physician as well as a philosopher and poet). However, the\nextant fragments do not show any detailed connection with medical\nexplanations. The equal proportion in the mixture of blood does seem\nrelated to another kind of explanation. Blood has a central role to\nplay in Empedocles\u2019 account of biological processes, to which we\nnow turn; among other things, it is that whereby men think (B 105 = D\n240). It appears that the equal mixture allows discrimination of all\nthings (since, of course, all things are made up of the four elements\nin differing proportions).\n",
