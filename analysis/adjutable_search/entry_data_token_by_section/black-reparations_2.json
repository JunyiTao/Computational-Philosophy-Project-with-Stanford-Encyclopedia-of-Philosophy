    "main_text": "Reparations, Restitution, and Compensation\n3. Reparations, Restitution, and Compensation\n\n\nIn its primary sense, restitution is \u201crestoration of something\nlost or stolen to its proper owner\u201d (The New Oxford American\nDictionary 2001). Clearly, then, reparations and restitution both\npresuppose the separation of something from its proper owner. But,\nequally clearly, reparations do not constitute restitution. Reparations\ncan only occur after some losses or damage due to a prior wrongdoing.\nBut though restitution can only occur after some loss or damage, that\nloss or damage need not be due to a prior wrongdoing. If A\nloses his wallet and B finds it and returns it to A,\nrestitution has been made although no wrongdoing was committed.\nFurther, while reparations is a right (or a cluster of rights),\nrestitution is not always a right. If B finds but leaves\nA\u2019s wallet where it is, restitution has not been made,\nbut it is not clear that a right was violated. It is doubtful that a\nperson who loses things has a right that others find it for him. If\nB finds but keeps A\u2019s wallet, then again\nrestitution has not been made, and A has a right that\nB return it. But in that case A has a right that\nB return it because A has a right to reparations and\nrestitution can sometimes be part of reparations. Some authors seem to\nthink that B ought to return the wallet because otherwise\nB will have unjustly enriched himself at A\u2019s\nexpense. But it is not clear why B\u2019s unjust enrichment\nis a necessary condition for B\u2019s obligation to return\nthe wallet to A. Even if the wallet is worthless and\nB is not unjustly enriched by keeping it, B has no\nbusiness holding on to it since it is not his property.\n\nRestitution is neither necessary nor sufficient for reparations even\nwhen the thing to be restored to its proper owner was stolen. If\nA steals a bicycle from B, B has a right to\nreparations and consequently to restitution if A has the\nbicycle; reparations must give satisfaction, and A\u2019s\nsatisfaction may depend on her getting back the very thing that was\nstolen from her. But she may have lost more than the bicycle as a\ndirect result of its theft and her right to reparations requires\nsatisfaction for that further loss. Consequently, restitution is not\nalways sufficient for reparations. On the other hand, the bicycle may\nhave been destroyed or loss after its theft, making restitution but not\nreparations impossible. Consequently, restitution is not necessary for\nreparations.\n\nCompensation is related to reparations and restitution but is not\nthe same thing as either. It is not reparation because it simply makes\nup for damage, harm or loss or lack whether or not it was caused by\nwrongdoing. Robert Nozick\u2019s famous definition of compensation\nmakes this sufficiently clear: \u201cSomething fully compensates a\nperson for a loss if and only if it makes him no worse off than he\nwould otherwise have been; it compensates person X for\nperson\u2019s Y\u2019s action A if X is no\nworse off receiving it, if Y had not done A.\u201d\n(Nozick 1974: 57)\n\nNote that Nozick (correctly) does not say that the loss or the\naction A must be wrongful. Thus a person may be compensated\nfor a loss though he does not have a right to reparations. If a person\ndeserves a loss he has no right to reparations for it, but he may be\ncompensated for it, probably unjustifiably. Even if he has a\nright to compensation, he may still have no right to\nreparations. For example, he may have a right to be compensated for a\nloss if he is insured against it, but his right is a right to\ncompensation not a right to reparations if no wrongdoing caused his\nloss.\n\nBut if a person has a right to reparations, he will also often have\na right to compensation. This is because his right to reparations is a\nright to satisfaction for the damages he suffered and such satisfaction\noften requires that he be made no worse off than he would have been had\nhe not suffered the loss. This does not make a right to compensation\nthe same thing as a right to reparations since a right to reparations\ncan only be generated by damages caused by wrongdoing.\n\nSince a right to reparations is always generated by a wrongful harm,\nsuch rights are part of corrective justice or to use Rawls\u2019s\nterm, \u201cpartial compliance theory\u201d (Rawls 1971: 8, 9). But\nRawls must allow that there can be rights to compensation in full\ncompliance theory. This follows since people can suffer damages that\nresult from no one\u2019s wrongdoing, and may have insured themselves\nagainst such damages. Consider too Rawls\u2019s \u201cprinciple of\nredress\u201d. This is a principle of compensation for full compliance\ntheory. It may be objected that it cannot be such a principle, but must\nbe instead a principle of non-ideal justice, since according to Rawls\nhimself it requires that \u201cundeserved inequalities\u201d, such as\nthe \u201cinequalities of birth and natural endowment\u201d be\n\u201csomehow compensated for\u201d (Rawls 1999: 100). But\nRawls\u2019s use of \u201cundeserved\u201d at this point is not\nmeant to imply that he is referring to inequalities that are the result\nof injustice. It only means that those with the inequalities in\nquestion did nothing to deserve them.\n",
