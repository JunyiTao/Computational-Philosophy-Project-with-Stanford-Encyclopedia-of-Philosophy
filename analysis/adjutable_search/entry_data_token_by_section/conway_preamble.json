    "main_text": "\n\nLady Anne Conway (nee Anne Finch) was one of a tiny minority of\nseventeenth-century women who was able to pursue an interest in\nphilosophy. She was associated with the Cambridge Platonists,\nparticularly Henry More (1614\u20131687). Her only surviving\ntreatise, Principles of the Most Ancient and Modern\nPhilosophy, was published posthumously and anonymously in 1690.\nThis propounds a vitalist ontology of spirit, derived from the\nattributes of God, which she sets out in opposition to More,\nDescartes, Hobbes and Spinoza. Her philosophy was received favorably\nby Leibniz.\n",
