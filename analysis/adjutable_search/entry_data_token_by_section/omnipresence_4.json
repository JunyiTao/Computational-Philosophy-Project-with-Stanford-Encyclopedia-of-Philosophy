Some Recent Alternative Proposals\n\nAlthough conceiving of omnipresence in terms of power, knowledge, and\nessence is the traditional approach, with continued adherents, in\nrecent years several philosophers have proposed quite different\naccounts of omnipresence.\n\nRobert Oakes (2006) suggests that space is \u201cconstituted\nby\u201d God\u2019s omnipresence. He holds that things located in\nspace and the world itself are therefore distinct from God. Oakes then\ndraws on these claims to argue that divine omnipresence is\nincompatible with\n pantheism.\n\nSome recent work appeals to esoteric concepts from metaphysics. Luco\nJohan van den Brom (1984; see also 1993) suggests that \u201cGod has\na spatial dimension of his own which he does not share with\nthe created cosmos.\u201d Brom\u2019s idea is that just as a\ntwo-dimensional surface \u201ctranscends\u201d a line on that\nsurface but is present at every point on the line, and similarly for a\nthree-dimensional space and a two-dimensional plane in that space,\n\u201cGod, by existing in a higher dimensional system, is also\npresent in the places of all the objects in the three-dimensional\nspace of created cosmos without being contained by that\nthree-dimensional space\u201d (1984, p. 654). Brom even conjectures\nthat God possesses at least two extra dimensions, making it impossible\nfor our space to bisect his.\n\nOther recent work draws on contemporary discussions on the metaphysics\nof material objects and their relation to spacetime. Hud Hudson (2009)\ndescribes several possible \u201coccupation\u201d relations. One of\nthese relations is \u201centension\u201d, where an object\nentends a region r just in case it is wholly and\nentirely located at r and also wholly located at every proper\nsubregion of r. An object is entirely located at a\nregion r just in case it is located at r and there\nis no region disjoint from r at which it is located. And an\nobject is wholly located at r just in case it is located\nat r and no proper part of it is not located\nat r. The typical way in which an object is located at a\nregion of space is by having various of its parts at different\nsubregions of that region; that is, typically material objects are\n\u201cspread out\u201d or distributed through a region they occupy\n(they \u201cpertend\u201d, to use a technical term). In contrast, if\nan object entends a region, then it is located as a whole\nthroughout that region. Hudson then proposes a \u201cliteral\noccupation account of omnipresence as ubiquitous entension\u201d\n(2009, p. 209). Omnipresence is location at \u201cthe maximally\ninclusive region\u201d plus being wholly located at every subregion\nthere is. Alexander R. Pruss (2013) also endorses a version of this\naccount, with slightly different details to allow explicitly for\ndivine timelessness. In Hudson\u2019s view, any object that occupies\na region in space is a material object. He is thus willing to accept\nas a consequence of his account of omnipresence as ubiquitous\nentension that God is a material object. Ross Inman (2017), while\nsympathetic to the appeal to ubiquitous entension, is unwilling to\naccept the conclusion that God is a material object. Accordingly he\nshows that careful attention to medieval discussions of the\ndistinction between material and immaterial objects yields at least\nthree ways of marking that distinction according to which God is not\nmaterial.\n\nEleonore Stump (2010, see also 2008, 2011, 2013) defends adding\nadditional conditions to the traditional understanding of omnipresence\nin terms of knowledge and power. She writes, \u201cI \u2026 think,\nhowever, that the attempt to capture personal presence in terms of\ndirect and unmediated cognitive and casual contact misses something\neven in the minimal sense of personal presence\u201d (2010, p. 111).\nShe continues, \u201cwhat has to be added to the condition of direct\nand unmediated casual and cognitive contact \u2026 are two\nthings\u2013\u2013namely, second-person experience and shared\nattention\u201d (2010, p. 112). Second-person experience involves\nbeing aware of and attending to someone else as a person when that\nother person is conscious and functioning as a person. Shared\nattention requires that two persons be aware of each other and aware\nof their awareness, whether of each other or a third object.\nStump\u2019s goal is to provide an understanding of the kind of union\nto be desired in love. It may be, then, that her real topic is the\nnature of God\u2019s offer of love to people. But she explicitly\napplies her remarks about personal presence to omnipresence when she\nwrites, \u201cin order for God to be omnipresent, that is, in order\nfor God to be always and everywhere present, it also needs to\nbe the case that God is always and everywhere in a position to share\nattention with any creature able and willing to share attention with\nGod\u201d (2010, p. 117). Perhaps, then, Stump can be seen not only\nas attempting to analyze omnipresence but to identify what is required\nfor it to be of religious or theological importance.\n\nGeorg Gasser (2019) also defends adding an additional condition\ninvolving agency to the traditional appeal to knowledge and power. He\nconsiders a variety of proposed accounts of omnipresence, giving\nspecial attention (and initial sympathy) to Hudson\u2019s development\nof ubiquitous entension. But he concludes that this proposal has a\nhard time explaining \u201cthe biblical tradition and personal\nreligious experiences [according to which] God acts differently at\ndifferent places\u201d (2019, 59). Perhaps he takes Stump\u2019s\nsecond-person attention and shared experience, which he references, to\nprovide the requisite agency, or perhaps he intends such actions as,\nfor example, God\u2019s speaking to Moses in the burning bush and\nalso preventing the consumption of the bush by fire. In any event,\nGasser assumes that omnipresence includes, not only God\u2019s\npresence through his knowledge and power everywhere, but also\n\u201cacting from time to time \u2026 \u2018specially\u2019 in\nmiraculous ways\u201d (2019, p. 60).\n",
