    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in mathematics || Some historical remarks\n2.1 Some historical remarks\n\nSince contributions in analytic philosophy to the study of\nmathematical explanations date back only to Steiner 1978a, one might\nsuspect that the topic was a byproduct of the Quinean conception of\nscientific theories (see Resnik & Kushner, 1987, 154). Once\nmathematics and natural science were placed on the same footing, it\nbecame possible to apply a unified methodology to both areas. Thus, it\nmade sense to look for explanations in mathematics just as in natural\nscience. However, this historical reconstruction would be mistaken.\nMathematical explanations of mathematical facts have been part of\nphilosophical reflection since Aristotle. We have already seen in\nsection 1.1 the distinction Aristotle drew between demonstrations\n\u201cof the fact\u201d and demonstrations \u201cof the reasoned\nfact\u201d. Both are logically rigorous but only the latter provide\nexplanations for their results. Aristotle had also claimed that\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d occur in\nmathematics. Only these demonstrations can be called\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d demonstrations, and some of these\ndemonstrations will be mathematical proofs.\n\nAristotle\u2019s position on explanatory proofs in mathematics was\nalready challenged in ancient times. Proclus, in his \u201cCommentary\non the first book of Euclid\u2019s Elements\u201d, informs us on\nthis point. He reports: \u201cMany persons have thought that geometry\ndoes not investigate the cause, that is, does not ask the question\n\u2018Why?\u2019\u201d (Proclus 1970, 158\u2013159; for more on\nProclus on mathematical explanation see Harari 2008). Proclus himself\nsingles out certain propositions in Euclid\u2019s\n\u201cElements\u201d, such as I.32, as not being demonstrations\n\u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. Euclid I.32 states that the sum of\nthe internal angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles. If the\ndemonstration were given by a scientific syllogism in the Aristotelean\nsense, the middle of the syllogism would have to provide the\n\u2018cause\u2019 of the fact. But Proclus argues that\nEuclid\u2019s proof does not satisfy these Aristotelian constraints,\nfor the appeal to the auxiliary lines and exterior angles is not\n\u2018causal\u2019:\n\nWhat is called \u201cproof\u201d we shall find sometimes has the\nproperties of a demonstration in being able to establish what is\nsought by means of definitions as middle terms, and this is the\nperfect form of demonstration; but sometimes it attempts to prove by\nmeans of signs. This point should not be overlooked. Although\ngeometrical propositions always derive their necessity from the matter\nunder investigation, they do not always reach their results through\ndemonstrative methods. For example, when [from] the fact that the\nexterior angle of a triangle is equal to the two opposite interior\nangles it is shown that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle\nis equal to two right angles, how can this be called a demonstration\nbased on the cause? Is not the middle term used here only as a sign?\nFor even though there be no exterior angle, the interior angles are\nequal to two right angles; for it is a triangle even if its side is\nnot extended. (Proclus 1970, 161\u20132)\n\n\nIn addition, Proclus also held that proofs by contradiction were not\ndemonstrations \u201cof the reasoned fact\u201d. The rediscovery of\nProclus in the Renaissance was to spark a far-reaching debate on the\ncausality of mathematical demonstrations referred to above as the\nQuaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum (see section 1.1 for more on\nthis debate). The first shot was fired by Alessandro Piccolomini in\n1547. Piccolomini\u2019s aim was to disarm a traditional claim to the\neffect that mathematics derives its certainty on account of its use of\n\u201cscientific demonstrations\u201d in the Aristotelean sense\n(such proofs were known as \u201cpotissimae\u201d in the\nRenaissance). Since \u201cpotissimae\u201d demonstrations had to be\ncausal, Piccolomini attacked the argument by arguing that mathematical\ndemonstrations are not causal. This led to one of the most interesting\nepistemological debates of the Renaissance and the seventeenth\ncentury. Those denying the \u201ccausality\u201d of mathematical\ndemonstrations (Piccolomini, Pereyra, Gassendi etc.) argued by\nproviding specific examples of demonstrations from mathematical\npractice (usually from Euclid\u2019s Elements) which, they claimed,\ncould not be reconstructed as causal reasonings in the Aristotelian\nsense. By contrast, those hoping to restore \u201ccausality\u201d to\nmathematics aimed at showing that the alleged counterexamples could\neasily be accommodated within the realm of \u201ccausal\u201d\ndemonstrations (Clavius, Barrow, etc.). Interestingly, both positions\nin the debate assumed that mathematical proofs could be syllogized\n(Mancosu & Mugnai 2023). The historical developments have been\npresented in detail in Mancosu 1996 and Mancosu 2000.\n\nWhat is more important here is to appreciate that the basic intuition\n\u2013 the contraposition between explanatory and non-explanatory\ndemonstrations \u2013 had a long and successful history that has\ninfluenced both mathematical and philosophical developments well\nbeyond the seventeenth century. For instance, Mancosu 1999 shows that\nBolzano and Cournot, two major philosophers of mathematics in the\nnineteenth century, construe the central problem of philosophy of\nmathematics as that of accounting for the distinction between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations. In the case of Bolzano\nthis takes the form of a theory of Grund (ground) and Folge\n(consequence). Kitcher 1975 was the first to read Bolzano as\npropounding a theory of mathematical explanations (see Betti 2010 and\nRoski 2017 for recent contributions). In the case of Cournot this is\nspelled out in terms of the opposition between \u201cordre\nlogique\u201d and \u201cordre rationelle\u201d (see Cournot 1851).\nIn Bolzano\u2019s case, the aim of providing a reconstruction of\nparts of analysis and geometry, so that the exposition would use only\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d proofs, also led to major mathematical\nresults, such as his purely analytic proof of the intermediate value\ntheorem.\n\nIn conclusion to this section, we should also point out that there is\nanother tradition of thinking of explanation in mathematics that\nincludes Mill, Lakatos, Russell and G\u00f6del. These authors are\nmotivated by a conception of mathematics (and/or its foundations) as\nhypothetico-deductive in nature and this leads them to construe\nmathematical activity in analogy with how explanatory hypotheses occur\nin science (see Mancosu 2001 for more details). Related to inductivism\nare Cellucci 2008, 2017, which emphasize the connection between\nmathematical explanation and discovery.\n",
