    "main_text": "Political Science in General\n1. Political Science in General\n\nThe modern word \u2018political\u2019 derives from the Greek\npolitikos, \u2018of, or pertaining to, the polis\u2019.\n(The Greek term polis will be translated here as\n\u2018city-state\u2019. It is also commonly translated as\n\u2018city\u2019 or  simply anglicized as \u2018polis\u2019.\nCity-states like Athens and Sparta were relatively small and cohesive\nunits, in which political, religious, and cultural concerns were\nintertwined. The extent of their similarity to modern nation-states is\ncontroversial.) Aristotle\u2019s word for \u2018politics\u2019 is\npolitik\u00ea, which is short for politik\u00ea\nepist\u00eam\u00ea or \u2018political science\u2019. It\nbelongs to one of the three main branches of science, which Aristotle\ndistinguishes by their ends or objects. Contemplative science\n(including physics and metaphysics) is concerned with truth or\nknowledge for its own sake; practical science with good action; and\nproductive science with making useful or beautiful objects\n(Top. VI.6.145a14\u201316, Met. VI.1.1025b24,\nXI.7.1064a16\u201319, EN VI.2.1139a26\u20138). Politics is\na practical science, since it is concerned with the noble action or\nhappiness of the citizens (although it resembles a productive science\nin that it seeks to create, preserve, and reform political systems).\nAristotle thus understands politics as a normative or prescriptive\ndiscipline rather than as a purely empirical or descriptive\ninquiry.\n\nIn the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle describes his subject\nmatter as \u2018political science\u2019, which he characterizes as\nthe most authoritative science. It prescribes which sciences are to be\nstudied in the city-state, and the others \u2014 such as military\nscience, household management, and rhetoric \u2014 fall under its\nauthority. Since it governs the other practical sciences, their ends\nserve as means to its end, which is nothing less than the human good.\n\u201cEven if the end is the same for an individual and for a\ncity-state, that of the city-state seems at any rate greater and more\ncomplete to attain and preserve. For although it is worthy to attain\nit for only an individual, it is nobler and more divine to do so for a\nnation or city-state\u201d (EN I.2.1094b7\u201310). The two\nethical works (the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian\nEthics) explain the principles that form the foundations for\nthe Politics: that happiness is the highest human good, that\nhappiness is the activity of moral virtue defined in terms of the\nmean, and that justice or the common advantage is the political good.\nAristotle\u2019s political science thus encompasses the two fields which\nmodern philosophers distinguish as ethics and political philosophy.\n(See the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s ethics.)\n Political philosophy in the narrow sense is roughly speaking the\nsubject of his treatise called the Politics.
