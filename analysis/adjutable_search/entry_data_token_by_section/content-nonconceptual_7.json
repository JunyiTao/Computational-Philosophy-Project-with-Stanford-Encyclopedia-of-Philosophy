If the notion of nonconceptual content is to be useful,\nhowever, we need to have a substantive account of what nonconceptual\ncontent consists in and how it is to be ascribed\u2014an account that\nwill be the equivalent at the nonconceptual level of, for example, the\nFregean account of concepts and concept possession.\n\nTheories of nonconceptual content can be either global\naccounts or local accounts of content. To say that they are\nglobal accounts is just to say that they purport to be accounts of\ncontent tout court, rather than specifications of content\ncircumscribed to a particular representational domain (such as the\nthree domains mentioned in the section above). What is central to\nglobal accounts of nonconceptual content is that they deny that even\nthe paradigmatically conceptual propositional attitudes ever involve\nconceptual contents. As a result, such accounts of content are\nparticularly amenable to proponents of the \u201cstate\u201d view of\nthe nonconceptual debate (discussed above, section\n 3).\n If all content is nonconceptual, the nonconceptual debate can only be\nmeaningfully carried out at the level of state types, not at the level\nof content. Furthermore, since these accounts of nonconceptual content\nare fundamentally non-contrastive, they are of limited use in\nformulating the debate about nonconceptual content. As a\nresult, in what follows we will be more interested in local\naccounts of nonconceptual content. However, before attending to the\nvarious local specifications of nonconceptual content we will briefly\ndiscuss two popular global accounts of nonconceptual\ncontent\u2014possible world semantics and Russellian semantics (as we\nshall see, in discussing Tye\u2019s account of the content of\nperception, these global views can be modified so as to apply only\nlocally).\n\nThe first global account of nonconceptual content, which was already\nmentioned above, is possible world semantics (see, e.g., Stalnaker\n1984, 1998, Lewis 1979, 1986). According to proponents of this view,\nthe content of a mental representation consists of a proposition,\nwhere propositions are taken to be functions from possible worlds to\ntruth values, or alternatively the set of possible worlds in which the\nproposition is true. Beliefs and other propositional attitudes are\nthen attitudes a person might hold towards such sets of possible\nworlds. For example, if one believes that Norman shot Susan, one has\nthe belief attitude towards those possible worlds in which Norman\nactually did shoot Susan. This is merely to say that one takes the\nactual world to be a member of the set of possible worlds in which the\nproposition is true. Similarly, having a perception is having a\nrepresentational state the content of which is the set of possible\nworlds in which the perception is correct.\n\nThe second global account of nonconceptual content is the\nRussellian account. Proponents of this view also hold that\nthe content of a mental representation should be understood as a\nproposition. However, they follow Russell, broadly, in arguing that\npropositions are ordered n-tuples of objects and properties.\nPropositional attitudes are then relations between a person and an\nordered n-tuple that is the proposition that is the content\nof the attitude. For example, to have the belief that Norman shot\nSusan is to stand in the belief relation towards the proposition\n<<Norman, Susan>, being shot by>. (Theories falling under\nthis heading differ greatly; as representatives, see Salmon 1986,\nSoames 1987, Perry 1979, 1980, and other various articles in the\ncollection edited by Salmon and Soames 1988.) Similarly, the contents\nof a perceptual representation are just the objects that are\nrepresented and the properties that appear to characterize them. To\nperceive a blue carpet is to have a representational state the content\nof which is the carpet and the property blueness, that is, <carpet,\nblueness>. (Some Russellians, e.g., Tye 1995, 2000, 2005, hold that\nonly the properties things appear to have constitute the\ncontent of perception.)\n\nBoth possible world semantics and Russellian accounts of content are\nconsidered to be coarse grained accounts of content (in\ncontrast to the Fregean fine grained account of content). For\nexample, it seems to follow from the possible worlds account that a\nthinker who entertains the thought expressed by the sentences\n\u2018bachelors are unmarried men\u2019 and \u2018unmarried men are\nunmarried men\u2019 is related in both cases to the same set of\npossible worlds, and hence is having thoughts with the same content.\nSimilarly regarding the Russellian account of content. A thinker who\nentertains the thought expressed by the sentences \u2018Jocasta is\nbeautiful\u2019 and \u2018Oedipus\u2019 mother is beautiful\u2019\nis related in both cases to the same objects and properties (since\nJocasta just is Oedipus\u2019 mother), and hence is having\nthoughts with the same content. Some have argued that this implication\nand other related ones are detrimental to any coarse-grained account\nof content, in particular when applied to the propositional attitudes.\nWe will not review these arguments here, since they are elaborated\nelsewhere. (For more detailed discussion of these global accounts of\ncontent, see the entries on\n structured propositions,\n  propositional attitude reports, and\n belief.)\n\nTurning now to the local accounts of nonconceptual content,\nwe can expect that a substantive account of nonconceptual content will\nbe tailored to a specific explanatory task\u2014and each of the three\nmotivations discussed in the previous section for introducing the\nnotion will lend itself to a different such account.\n\nThe most developed proposal has come from Christopher Peacocke who has\nproposed a radically externalist conception of nonconceptual content\naimed explicitly at explaining the nonconceptual content of perceptual\nstates (Peacocke 1992). Peacocke suggests that a given perceptual\ncontent should be specified in terms of the ways of filling out the\nspace around the perceiver that are consistent with the\ncontent\u2019s being correct. For each minimally discriminable point\nwithin the perceiver\u2019s perceptual field (where these are\nidentified relative to an origin and axes centered in the\nperceiver\u2019s body) we need to start by specifying whether it is\noccupied by a surface and, if so, what the orientation, solidity, hue,\nbrightness and saturation of that surface are. This specification\ngives us the way the perceiver represents the environment. The content\nof that representation is given by all the ways of filling out the\nspace around the perceiver in which the minimally discriminable points\nhave the appropriate values. The representation is correct just if the\nspace around the perceiver is occupied in one of those ways. Peacocke\ncalls this type of nonconceptual content positioned scenario\ncontent.\n\nHowever, such a specification of the content of perception does not\ncompletely capture the way the world perceptually appears to us. Two\nrepresentations may have the same positioned scenario contents and yet\ndiffer in the way they represent the world to us as being. As an\nexample, upon looking at a 45\u00b0 tilted square one might perceive it\nas a tilted square or as an upright diamond. In both cases of\nperceiving the square as a square and as a diamond\nthe positioned scenario content is the same; that is, in both cases\nthe ways of filling out the space around the observer that are\nconsistent with the correctness of the scenario content are the same.\nHowever, there is still a phenomenal difference between these two ways\nof representing the square.\n\nTo account for this difference in the way in which the same object is\nperceptually represented Peacocke argues that there is an additional\nlayer of nonconceptual content that he calls proto-propositional\ncontent, which involves objects, properties, and relations rather than\nconcepts (Peacocke 1992). This level of content accounts for the way\nin which the square is perceived. When it is perceived as a square one\nperceives a symmetry about the bisectors of the sides, and when it is\nperceived as a diamond one perceives a symmetry about the bisectors of\nits angles. The content is nonconceptual since the observer need not\nhave the concepts of symmetry, or angle, or side, that are mentioned\nin specifying the content of his perception.\n\nThis proposal provides an attractive way of capturing the distinctive\nfeatures of the phenomenology of perception highlighted in the\nprevious section (see\n 4.1\n above). Peacocke\u2019s account of nonconceptual content is analog,\nunit-free and possesses the appropriate fineness of grain.\nNonetheless, as Cahen (2019) has recently argued, such an externalist\naccount of nonconceptual content, though it may capture the\nphenomenology of perception, is in tension with internalist\ncommitments pertaining to the rational role of perception. Another\nsource of difficulty is that it is not so clear how such an account\ncan be applied beyond the domain of perception. It may well be that\ncertain subpersonal states have such nonconceptual\ncontents\u2014those associated with the subpersonal underpinnings of\nvision are obvious candidates. But the representational states\nimplicated in tacit knowledge of syntactic theory, for example, do not\nfit this model.\n\nTye suggests a different notion of robustly nonconceptual content of\nperception (Tye 2005). According to Tye, perception involves\nRussellian nonconceptual content. This is supposedly in conflict with\nPeacocke who, in discussing the experience of perceiving the tilted\nsquare, claims at one point that \u201cWe must, in describing the\nfine-grained phenomenology, make use of the notion of the way\nin which some property or relation is given in the experience\u201d\n(Peacocke 2001a, p. 240). Appealing to a way in which the\nproperty of being a square is perceived is in conflict with\nTye\u2019s coarse-grained account of the content of perception which\nis required for his broader representationalist account of conscious\nperception (see the entry on\n the contents of perception\n (section 7) and the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness).\n Thus, Tye proposes that in perceiving the tilted square, perception\ndoesn\u2019t represent the property of being a square in two possible\nways, but rather that in addition to representing the\nproperty of being square it represents various other properties; which\nadditional properties are represented will determine the way the\nsquare appears. One suggestion is that when the figure is perceived as\na square, the property of being tilted is represented, and when it is\nperceived as a diamond the property of being upright is represented.\nThese are represented properties of the object, not ways in\nwhich the property, being square, is represented.\n\nSome theorists concerned with nonconceptual content at the subpersonal\nlevel have favored a broadly teleological account of what this content\nconsists in (drawing upon the teleological theory of content developed\nin Millikan 1984). This approach can be extended to cover\ncontent-bearing states such as those implicated in linguistic\nunderstanding (see the entry on\n teleological theories of mental content).\n The key notion here is the proper function of, for example, the\nmechanisms underlying a particular stage in visual information\nprocessing (construed normatively in terms of what those mechanisms\nshould do, and usually underwritten by evolutionary\nconsiderations). Proper functions are relational, where this\nmeans that they are defined in relation to features of the\nenvironment. According to teleological theories, content can be\nspecified in terms of relational proper functions. So, for example,\nthe content of a state in early visual processing might be specified\nin terms of the edges in the perceived environment that that stage has\nevolved to identify. Given the particular features that a processing\nmechanism has been \u2018designed\u2019 or \u2018selected\u2019 to\ndetect, it is functioning correctly when it responds appropriately to\nthe presence of those features, and incorrectly when it responds in\ntheir absence (for example, to a sudden contrast in light intensity\nnot due to the presence of an edge). Correctness conditions are fixed\nwith reference to evolutionary design and past performance.\n\nTurning to the third motivation for the notion of nonconceptual\ncontent, one might expect the notion of nonconceptual content involved\nin psychological explanation to be essentially perceptual. Some\nauthors have argued, for example, that the representational states of\nnon-linguistic creatures are essentially perceptual and tied to the\ncreature\u2019s possibilities for action and reaction in the\nimmediate environment (see, for example, Dummett 1993 and Campbell\n1994, although neither of these two authors puts the point in terms of\nnonconceptual content). This thought might be developed in conjunction\nwith an ability-based understanding of nonconceptual content along the\nlines proposed by Adrian Cussins (Cussins 1990). The central feature\nof Cussins\u2019s account of experiential content is that it should\nbe understood not in terms of notions such as truth and\ntruth-conditions, but rather in terms of the organism\u2019s\nabilities to act upon the perceived environment. What the organism\nperceives (the content of its perception) is a distal environment\nstructured in terms of the possibilities it affords for action. This\nconception of an ability-based conception of content yields a sharp\ndistinction between the success-governed level of proto-thoughts and\nthe truth-governed level of full-fledged thought. Proto-thought does\nnot involve experience of an objective world.\n\nOther authors concerned with explaining the behavior of non-linguistic\nand pre-linguistic creatures have proposed applying a richer notion of\nnonconceptual content that is not essentially pragmatic and that can\nbe deployed in a style of explanation analogous to propositional\nattitude explanation. Nonconceptual contents in this richer sense are\nproperly assessable for truth or falsity (rather than simply pragmatic\nsuccess or failure) and can serve as the objects of beliefs and\ndesires (or proto-beliefs and proto-desires). Berm\u00fadez (1998)\noffers an account along these lines developing certain aspects of\nPeacocke\u2019s scenario content. In later work he extended this\napproach to the ascription of thoughts to non-linguistic and\nprelinguistic creatures, developing a model based on a version of\nsuccess semantics and integrating what he termed proto-logical\ninferential capacities (Berm\u00fadez 2003).\n",
