    "main_text": "From Physiological to Evolutionary Individuals: Life, Reproduction, and Agency || Autonomous Agency\n6.3 Autonomous Agency\n\nThat all physiological individuals have some kind of autonomous agency\nis widely recognized and is the intuitive basis for the early\nsystematic formal theorization of biological autonomy undertaken on\nautopoetic systems by Maturana and Varela (1980) and more recently by Moreno\nand Mossio (2015). Although such views are typically cast in terms of\nbiological systems rather than individuals, they view the\nkind of unity of purpose that characterizes both physiological and\nevolutionary individuals as arising from more general principles\ngoverning biological organization, and that organization is important\nto biological individuality.\n\nPhysiological individuals such as organisms, however, are not simply\nbiological systems but living agents that have a life of their\nown. They are able to exercise some sort of special degree of\ncontrol over their whole selves and subsequently are relatively free\nwith respect to other things, including other agents and environments.\nThis might be expressed in terms of both the individual\u2019s\nrelative autonomy from its external environment and its control over\nthe activity of its components or internal parts (R.A. Wilson 2005:\n62\u201365). Organisms in particular have a distinctive kind of\nagency because of the integrity with which such autonomy and control\nimbues them. For Moreno and Mossio (2015: ch.6), developmental\nfunctions and constraints play an especially important role in\nestablishing this kind of organismic autonomy.\n\nThe idea of biological individuals having a locus of control\nin ways that neither non-living things nor obligately-dependent living\nthings (such as organs) have is key here. Pradeu\u2019s (2012) view\nof immunological control as marking the boundary of the biological\nindividual is one way of specifying this idea, as is\nGodfrey-Smith\u2019s continuous dimension of integration,\nwhich summarizes features such as \n\n\nthe extent of division of labor, the mutual dependence (loss of\nautonomy) of parts, and the maintenance of a boundary between a\ncollective and what is outside of it. (2009: 93) \n\n\nThe high level of functional integration or cohesion possessed by\nparts of individuals imbues the whole organisms they\nconstitute with both capacities to act and largely shared fates to\nwhich those capacities contribute (Collier 2004; Okasha 2011: 59;\nSober 1991: 291). In some sense, this is why any organism has a life\nto lead, rather than simply being alive.\n\nThis appeal to autonomous agency has a long history in thinking about\nwhat is distinctive about the biological world, particularly when the\nfocus has been on physiological individuals. For example, in the first\nvolume of his Principles of Biology (1866), Herbert Spencer\nargued at length that the capacity of a biological individual to \n\n\ncontinuously adjust its internal relations to\nexternal relations, so as to maintain the equilibrium of its\nfunctions (1866: 207, our emphasis) \n\n\nis one of the key features that sets it apart as biological. Likewise\nwhen Julian Huxley later proposed three conditions of what he called\nminimal organismality, one of these concerned integration of\ninternal functions and a second concerned independence from\nexternal forces (Huxley 1912: 28). Like Spencer, Huxley saw\nthese internal and external matters as causally linked within\nindividuals, and as together achieving equilibria in distinctive ways.\nHuxley thought this was due especially to the parts of biological\nindividuals being both more heterogeneous and functionally integrated\nwith each other than is seen in the non-biological context external to\nsuch individuals. Two contemporary cousins of this idea in the\nliterature focused on evolutionary individuals will be the focus of\n section 8\n below.\n\nAn interesting, relatively recent question is why the use of\ncognitive metaphors in describing biological agency is\nwidespread, if not ubiquitous (R.A. Wilson 2005: ch.4). Explorations\nof this question have involved some interesting integrative thinking\nacross the philosophy of biology, cognitive science, and the\nphilosophy of economics (Godfrey-Smith 2009: 142\u2013145; Dennett\n2011; Nicholson 2018; Okasha 2018). Four responses to this question\ngive some idea of the diverse literatures relevant to answering it.\n\n\nOne early hypothesis (R.A. Wilson: 2005: 74\u201379) is that the\nfunction of these metaphors is to crystallize agency,\nbringing about a focus on the causal agency of biological individuals\nby assimilating them to our paradigm of agents, human agents. This\ncrystallization thesis forms part of Wilson\u2019s tripartite view of\norganismic living agents (R.A. Wilson 2005: ch.3) that draws on the\nhomeostatic property cluster view of natural kinds (Boyd 1999, R.A.\nWilson, Barker, & Brigandt 2007). A second view is that the\ncognitive metaphor applies when behaviors and processes are\ngoal-directed, behavior is flexible, and there is exhibition of\nadaptation, and the metaphor earns it keep through the parallels\nbetween rational choice theory and evolutionary theorizing (Okasha\n2018). Okasha is concerned to articulate the scope and limits of the\ncognitive metaphor in evolutionary biology, taking organisms as his\nparadigm agents. A third view is that the use of psychological\npredication of the activities of cells, neurons, and bodily systems is\nnot metaphorical but should be taken literally (Figdor\n2018). Figdor\u2019s\nliteralism is a response to what she views as an anthropocentric\nperspective that assumes that human cognition is the standard against\nwhich other uses of psychological ascriptions should be judged.\nFinally, a fourth view is that appeals to the nature of subjectivity\nand point of view are key here (Godfrey-Smith 2019; see also\nGodfrey-Smith 2016c). Godfrey-Smith takes understanding the evolution\nof subjectivity to be central to advancing responses to\n\u201cexplanatory gap\u201d arguments in the philosophy of mind,\nimplying the graduated nature of cognition itself.\n",
