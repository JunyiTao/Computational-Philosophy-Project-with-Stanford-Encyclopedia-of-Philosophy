    "main_text": "Confucian Ethics || The centrality of li or ritual\n2.2 The centrality of li or ritual\n\nAnalects 1.15 likens the project of cultivating one\u2019s\ncharacter to crafting something fine from raw material: cutting bone,\ncarving a piece of horn, polishing or grinding a piece of jade. The\nchapter also stresses the importance of li (the rites,\nritual) in this project. In the Analects ritual ranges quite\nwidely to include ceremonies of ancestor worship, the burial of\nparents, and customs governing respectful and appropriate\nbehavior within the family and with friends, in everyday\ninteractions with others in one\u2019s village, and protocols for\nofficials performing their duties within the court.\n\nRitual is an exemplification of the saying that the personal is the\npolitical. It is personal in the sense that engaging in ritual,\nlearning to perform it properly and with the right attitudes of\nrespect and consideration while performing it, is to engage in a kind\nof cutting and carving and polishing and grinding of the self. One of\nthe most distinctive marks of Confucian ethics is the centrality of\nritual performance in the ethical cultivation of character. For\nexample, while Aristotelian habituation generally corresponds to the\nConfucian cultivation of character, there is no comparable\nemphasis in Aristotle on the role of ritual performance in this\nprocess of character transformation. Ritual is also political in the\nsense that the right governance of a society is thought to be founded\nupon the appropriate conduct of relationships at all levels in a\nsociety, starting with family relationships as the foundation. As\nOlberding puts it, the term li covers both\ngood manners and political civility because the Confucians did not\ndistinguish between them: \u201cboth require interpreting situations and\nsteering conduct to communicate respect, consideration, and\ntoleration. Success in both will likewise often depend on developed\ndisposition, on prior patterning that renders me more prone to one\nkind of response than another\u201d (2019, 28).\n\nIt is clear that in the Analects any complete\ndescription of self-cultivation must include a role for the culturally\nestablished customs that spell out what it means to express respect\nfor another person in various social contexts. Just how that role is\nconceived, however, is one of the central interpretive puzzles\nconcerning the Analects. The interpretive question of\nhow li is central to self-cultivation is posed in\nparticular about its relation to the chief virtue of ren. In\nthe Analects 3.3 the Master said, \u201cA man who is not\nren\u2014what has he to do with ritual?\u201d The\nimplication is that ritual is a means of cultivating and expressing a\nren that is already there, at least in a raw or unrefined\nstate. This implication about the role of ritual is consistent with\npassages of the Analects in which Confucius shows flexibility\non the question of whether to follow established ritual practice. 9.3\nshows him accepting the contemporary practice of wearing a cheaper\nsilk ceremonial cap rather than the traditional linen cap. 9.3 also\nshows Confucius rejecting the contemporary practice of bowing after\none ascends the stairs leading up to the ruler\u2019s dais, and\nmaintaining the traditional practice of bowing before one ascends the\nstairs. The implication is that the contemporary practice expresses\nthe wrong attitude toward the ruler\u2014presumptuousness in assuming\npermission to ascend. 9.3 suggests that it is something like the right\nattitude that is cultivated and expressed by ritual. Kwong-loi Shun\n(1993) has called this kind of understanding of ritual the\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d interpretation.\n\nHowever, in other places of the Analects, ritual seems to\ntake on a more central role in the achievement of ren.\nIndeed, it seems to be presented as the key. A very common\ntranslation of 12.1 has Confucius telling his favorite student Yan Hui\nthat \u201cRestraining yourself and returning to the rites\nconstitutes ren. If for one day you managed to restrain\nyourself and return to the rites, in this way you could lead the\nentire world back to ren. The key to achieving ren\nlies within yourself\u2014how could it come from others?\u201d\n(translation from Slingerland, 2003, though see Li, 2007, for a\ndifferent translation of the word wei usually translated as\n\u2018constitutes\u2019, with different implications for the\nquestion of the relation between li and ren). Such\npassages have given rise to the \u201cdefinitionalist\u201d\ninterpretation, as Shun calls it, which makes li definitive\nof the whole of ren. Obviously the instrumental and\ndefinitional interpretations cannot both be true.\n\nOne possibility for resolving this tension is to construe\nConfucius\u2019 remarks as directed towards a particular student and\ninformed by his conception of what sort of advice that student needs\nto hear given his strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps Confucius believes\nthat Yan Hui should be focusing on disciplining himself through\nobserving the rites, but his advice should not be be taken as an\nintended generalization about the relationship between ren\nand li. Perhaps the remarks that suggest more of an\ninstrumentalist construal of the relationship are similarly context\nand audience bound. Such interpretation, of course, leaves open the\nquestion of what that relationship is, or indeed, whether Confucius\never had in mind a generalization about the relationship that informed\nhis remarks.\n\nSome have argued that such serious conflicts within the text\nconstitute reasons for thinking that the Analects is an\naccretive text, i.e., composed of layers added at different times by\ndifferent people with conflicting views. To some extent, viewing the\nAnalects as accretive is nothing new, but Bruce and A. Takeo\nBrooks (1998, 2000) have taken that view very far by identifying Book\n4 (and only part of it, for that matter) as the most reflective of the\nhistorical Kongzi\u2019s views, and the other books as stemming from\nConfucius\u2019s students and members of his family. The different\nbooks, and, sometimes, individual passages within the books, represent\ndifferent time periods, people, with different agendas who are\nresponding to different conditions, and often putting forward\nincompatible strands of Confucianism. The Brooks suggest that the\nparts of the Analects most directly associated with the\nhistorical Confucius and his disciples are the parts that feature\nren as the pre-eminent virtue and that de-emphasize the role\nof ritual. The parts that are due to another trend in Confucianism,\nheaded by Confucius\u2019s descendants, are the parts that elevate\nritual as the key to ren. The Brooks\u2019s theory of the\nAnalects has drawn appreciation and disagreement (e.g., see\nSlingerland, 2000 for both). It threatens to dislodge the assumption\nthat underlies the dominant mode of interpreting the\nAnalects, which is that the text, or most of it, reflects the\ncoherent thought of one person.\n\nTao Jiang (2022) distinguishes between the sinological approach of the\nkind done by the Brooks and the approach of\nphilosophers that focuses on the \u201cinfluential received\ntext\u201d which presents to the reader a \u201ctextual\nauthor,\u201d e.g., a Confucius, to whom authorial intent is\nattributed through the sayings and ideas in the text. The philosopher\ninvestigates this textual object as part of a lengthy and highly\ninfluential philosophical and cultural tradition that often deploys\ntexts to address problems of contemporary concern. \n\nA third approach, different from though in some respects simiar to the\nsecond, is to acknowledge the real possibility that different sets of\npassages are the products of different thinkers, but also to hold that\nthese different thinkers might have employed different but\nphilosophically substantial perspectives on common problems. One of\nthose problems might indeed have been the relation between\nren and li, and at least part of the explanation of\nwhy different and potentially conflicting things are said about that\nrelation is that the relation is a difficult one to figure out and\nthat different thinkers addressing that common problem might\nreasonably have arrived at different things to say. Whether these\ndifferent things are ultimately irreconcilable remains an open\nquestion. This third approach merges with the second if one is open to\nthe possibility that the \u201ctextual author\u201d could be\nconceived as being of more than one mind as to how to solve the\nproblem in question.  This, after all, is a plausible thing to say\nabout some philosophers of whom we are pretty sure that they were the\nsingle authors of the texts under study. One might take a constructive\nattitude to the different possible solutions, ask what good\nphilosophical reasons could motivate the different approaches, and\ndetermine whether there is a way of reconciling what all the good\nreasons entail. If not, one can ask what might be the best solution,\nall things considered.\n\nKwong-loi Shun\u2019s approach to the ren and\nli is compatible with the third approach. Shun holds\nthat on the one hand, a particular set of ritual forms are the\nconventions that a community has evolved, and without such forms\nattitudes such as respect or reverence cannot be made intelligible or\nexpressed (reasons in favor of the definitionalist interpretation). In\nthis sense, li constitutes ren within or for a given\ncommunity. On the other hand, different communities may have different\nconventions that express respect or reverence, and moreover any given\ncommunity may revise its conventions in piecemeal though not wholesale\nfashion (reasons in favor of the instrumentalist interpretation).\n\nChenyang Li (2007) proposes a different approach based on a different\nreading of the word \u2018wei\u2019 used in 12.1 and often\ntranslated as \u2018constitutes\u2019 to render the crucial line,\n\u201cRestraining yourself and returning to the rites constitutes\nren.\u201d Li notes that a common meaning of the word is\n\u2018make\u2019 or \u2018result in.\u2019 The relation between\nli and ren need not be construed as either\ndefinitional or constitutive, nor need it be construed as purely\ninstrumental. Li proposes that li functions something like a\ncultural grammar where ren is like mastery of the culture.\nMastery of a language entails mastery of its grammar but not vice\nversa.\n\nBoth Shun and Li are striving to capture a way in which ren\ndoes not reduce to li but also a way in which li is\nmore than purely instrumental to the realization of ren.\nThere are good philosophical reasons for this move. Consider the\nreasons for resisting the reduction of ren to li. As\nindicated above, 9.3 suggests that the attitudes of respect and\nreverence that are expressed by ritual forms are not reducible to any\nparticular set of such forms, and Shun has a point in arguing that\nsuch attitudes could be expressed by different sets of such forms as\nestablished by different communities. In studying the cultures of\nother communities, we recognize that certain customs are meant to\nsignify respect, even if we do not share these customs, just as we\nrecognize that something that does not signify disrespect in our\nculture does indeed so signify in another culture. The fact that we\ncan distinguish the attitude from the ritual forms that we use to\nexpress them allows us to consider alternative ritual forms that could\nexpress the same or similar attitude. Ceremonial caps that are made of\nmore economical material are acceptable, perhaps, because wearing such\ncaps do not affect the spirit of the ceremony. By contrast,\nbowing after one ascends the stairs constitutes an unacceptable change\nin attitude. To maintain that particular ritual forms do not\ndefine the respect and reverence they are intended to express\nis not to underestimate their importance for cultivating and\nstrengthening these attitudes. Acting in ways that express respect\ngiven the conventionally established meanings of accepted ritual forms\nhelps to strengthen the agent\u2019s disposition to have respect. The\nethical development of character does involve strengthening some\nemotional dispositions over others, and we\n\n strengthen dispositions by acting on them. By providing\nconventionally established, symbolic ways to express respect for\nothers, ritual forms give participants ways to act on and therefore to\nstrengthen the right dispositions. The cultivating function of\nobserving ritual highlights the distinctive practical focus of\nConfucian ethics. It is every bit as concerned with how to\nacquire the right sort of character as it is with what the right sort\nis.\n\nOn the other hand, there is good reason to resist the reduction of\nli simply to the role of expressing and cultivating a set of\nattitudes and emotional dispositions. In his influential\ninterpretation (1972) of the Analects, Herbert Fingarette\nconstrues ritual performance as an end in itself, as beautiful and\ndignified, open and shared participation in ceremonies that celebrate\nhuman community. Ritual performance, internalized so that it becomes\nsecond nature, such that it is gracefully and spontaneously performed,\nis a crucial constituent of a fully realized human life. There are\nnonconventional dimensions of what it is to show respect, such as\nproviding food for one\u2019s parents (see Analects 2.7),\nbut the particular way the agent does this will be deeply influenced\nby custom. Indeed, custom specifies what is a respectful way of\nserving food. On the Confucian view, doing so in a graceful and\nwhole-hearted fashion as spelled out by the customs of one\u2019s\ncommunity is part of what it is to live a fully human life.\n\nRitual constitutes an important part of what ren is, and\nhence it is not merely an instrument for refining the substance of\nren. At the same time it is not the whole of ren.\nConsider that part of ren that involves attitudinal\ndispositions. Attitude is not reducible to ritual form even if acting\non that form can cultivate and sustain attitude. Moreover, 7.30\nemphasizes the connection between desire for ren and its\nachievement (\u201cIf I simply desire ren, I find that it is\nalready there\u201d). The achievement of ren is of course a\ndifficult and long journey, and so 7.30 implies that coming to truly\ndesire it lies at the heart of that achievement. The multifaceted\nnature of ren emerges in Book 12, where Confucius is\nportrayed as giving different descriptions of ren. In 12.1,\nas already noted, he says that ritual makes for ren. But then\nin 12.2, he says that ren involves comporting oneself in\npublic as if one were receiving an important guest and in the\nmanagement of the common people behaving as if one were overseeing a\ngreat sacrifice (the duty to be respectful toward others). 12.2 also\nassociates ren with shu or \u201csympathetic\nunderstanding,\u201d not imposing on others what you yourself do not\ndesire. Here the emphasis is not so much on ritual or not exclusively\nanyway, but on the attitudes one displays toward others, and on the\nability to understand what others want or do not want based on\nprojecting oneself into their situation. In 12.3, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that ren people are hesitant to\nspeak (suggesting that such people take extreme care not to have their\nwords exceed their actions). And then in 12.22, when asked about\nren, Confucius says that it is to care for people. Such\ndiverse characterizations are appropriate if ren is complete\nethical virtue or comprehensive excellence that includes many\ndimensions, including but not reducing to the kinds of excellence\nassociated with li.\n\nIf we take the relevant passages on li and ren as\nforming a whole in which a coherent view is embedded, there is a\npretty good case for regarding the observance of ritual propriety as a\nconstituent of ren as well as crucial for instrumentally\nrealizing some other dimensions of ren. But it does not\nexhaust the substance of ren. If the text is as radically\naccretive as the Brooks maintain, then the proposed construal of the\nrelation is more of a reconstruction of what the best philosophical\nposition might be on the nature of the relation. The reconstructive\npossibility should not be disturbing as long as we recognize it for\nwhat it is. Thinkers within a complex and vigorous tradition\nfrequently re-interpret, expand, develop, revise, and even reject some\nof what one has inherited from the past. The fact that the\nAnalects itself might be a product of this kind of engagement\nmight usefully be taken as encouragement for its present students to\nengage with the text in the same way.\n\nThe Confucian position on the importance of li in ethical\ncultivation is interesting and distinctive in its own right, and this\nis partly because Confucianism hews close to a kind of pre-theoretical\nexperience of the moral life that might otherwise get obscured by a\nmore purely theoretical approach to ethics. If we look at everyday\nexperience of the moral life, we see that much of the substance of\nethically significant attitudes such as respect is in fact given by\ncultural norms and practices, and learning a morality must involve\nlearning these norms and practices. Children learn what their behavior\nmeans to others, and what it should mean, by learning how to greet\neach other, make requests, and answer requests, all in a respectful\nmanner. Much of our everyday experience of moral socialization lies in\nthe absorption of or teaching to others of customs that are\nconventionally established to mean respect, gratitude, and other\nethically significant attitudes (see Olberding, 2016, 2019).\n\nSo construed, Confucian ethics provides an alternative to\nunderstanding the nature of the moral life that is different from an\nunderstanding that is primarily based on abstract principles, even\nabstract principles that require respect for each person. This is why\nthere is significant resonance between Confucianism and communitarian\nphilosophies such as those defended by Alasdair MacIntyre (1984, 1989)\nand Michael Walzer (1983). One of the distinctive marks of\ncommunitarianism is the theme that much of the substance of a morality\nis given not in abstract principles of the sort typically defended in\nmodern Western philosophy but in a society\u2019s specific customs\nand practices. In the Analects, the ambiguous relation\nbetween ren and li poses the problematic of how we\nare to understand the relation between cultural norms and practices on\nthe one hand and that part of morality that appears to transcend any\nparticular set of norms and practices. The Analects suggests\na large role for culture, but on the reading suggested here, not a\ndefinitional role. There is much room for theoretical elaboration on\nthe nature of that role.\n\nFurthermore, in understanding why Confucians take a life of ritual\npractice to be partly constitutive of a fully human life, one must\nunderstand the aesthetic dimension of their notion of a fully human\nlife. Such a life is lived as a beautiful and graceful coordinated\ninteraction with others according to conventionally established forms\nthat express mutual respect. A good part of the value attached to the\nfully human life lies in the aesthetic dimensions of a\n\u201cdance\u201d (Ihara, 2004) one performs with others. To better\nunderstand why the moral and the aesthetic cannot be cleanly separated\nin Confucian ethics, consider that a graceful and whole-hearted\nexpression of respect can be beautiful precisely because it reflects\nthe extent that the agent has made this moral attitude part of their\nsecond nature. The beauty has a moral dimension. Both these\nthemes\u2014the importance of contextualized moral judgment and\naesthetic value of human interaction according to custom and\ntradition\u2014offer opportunities for practitioners of, say,\nAnglo-American moral philosophy to reflect on what their approaches to\nthe moral life might miss.\n",
