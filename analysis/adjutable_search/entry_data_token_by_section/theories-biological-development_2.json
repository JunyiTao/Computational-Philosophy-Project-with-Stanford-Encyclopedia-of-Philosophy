    "main_text": "Aristotle and Aristotelianism\n3. Aristotle and Aristotelianism\n\nAristotle was a keen observer of many things, including embryos.\nLooking at chicks, for example, and drawing on his interpretations\ndeveloped earlier for the physical sciences, he saw material, final,\nformal, and efficient causes at work in the generation of individual\norganisms. The early egg was not formed; it did not already contain a\nlittle chick (or whatever the species). Instead, an individual animal\nonly gradually acquired a heart that began beating; likewise for the\nother parts that make it a chick. The material may be there from the\nbeginning, but the formal cause only gradually plays out along with\nthe efficient cause of embryonic development.\n\nThus, Aristotle could fit his observations of embryos into his larger\ntheoretical interpretations of the world. In sexual generation,\nindividual organisms begin when the fluids from the mother and the\nfather come together. This combines the essential causes and initiates\nthe developmental process. The maternal contribution is the material\ncause, which resides in the menstrual blood. After \u201cthe\ndischarge is over and most of it has passed off, then what remains\nbegins to take shape as a fetus\u201d (Aristotle De Generatione\nAnimalium [GA], 1.727b17\u201318). Yet the menstrual blood, or female\nsemen, is only that out of which it generates and must be acted upon\nby the male semen which is that which generates. Together, consistent\nwith the essential nature of the species and telos (or final\ncause) in question, the formal cause and efficient causal process act\nto bring a formed individual organism from potential into actual\nbeing. Gradually, over time, an individual organism\u2019s form\nbegins to emerge from the unformed. The male and female parents serve\nas the \u201cprinciples of generation\u201d for each individual\norganism (in sexually-generating species).\n\nFor Aristotle, an individual life begins when the male and female\nsemen are brought together. This is an external action, which starts\nthe individual formative process. From that point on, the process is\ninternal, initially driven by causes internal to the combined fluids.\nThe process then leads to formation of the individual\u2019s type,\nsince \u201conce a thing has been formed, it must of necessity\ngrow\u201d (Aristotle GA 1.735a18\u201319). (See Lennox 2001 for\ndiscussion of Aristotle\u2019s predecessors on these points; see Van\nSpeybroeck et al. 2002; Vinci & Robert 2005; Connell 2016, 2020;\nFalcon & Lefebvre 2017; Henry 2017; Hopwood et al. 2018; on\nAristotle\u2019s theory of generation and subsequent scientific\ndevelopment of these ideas.)\n\nAn individual organic life requires an internal source of motion, or\n\u201csoul\u201d, which resides in the material body from the\noutset. This soul guides the gradual epigenetic process of\ndevelopment. This is the Aristotelian and not the Christian soul. Soul\nconsists of the vegetative (for all organisms), locomotory (for\nanimals), and rational (for humans). The soul, consisting of one to\nthree parts depending on the kind of living being, resides in the\ncombination of male and female semen. The living differs from the dead\nbecause of the action of the soul. Therefore, it is the teleological\ndrive of the potential that actualizes the individual and its form and\nfunction, epigenetically, gradually, and internally.\n\nAristotelians followed Aristotle and without much further study of\nembryos interpreted the process of generation, including human\ndevelopment, as gradual and epigenetic. Traditional Catholicism\nagreed. St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas both held that\nhominization, or the coming into being of the human, occurs only\ngradually. Quickening was thought to occur around 40 days, and to be\nthe point at which the merely animal mix of material fluids was\nensouled. Until 1859, when Pope Pius IX decreed that life begins at\n\u201cconception\u201d, the Church was epigenetic along with the\nAristotelians (see Maienschein 2003).\n",
