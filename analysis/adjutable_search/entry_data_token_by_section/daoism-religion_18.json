    "main_text": "Dao and Cosmos || Essence, Breath, Spirit\n4.2 Essence, Breath, Spirit\n\nWith its self-manifestation, the Dao gives birth to the three main\ncomponents of the cosmos. Collectively called the\n\u201cthree treasures\u201d (sanbao), these components are\njing, or Essence, qi, or Breath, and shen,\nor Spirit.[1]\nEach of them has two aspects, related to their unmanifested or\n\u201cprecelestial\u201d natures and to their\n\u201cpostcelestial\u201d forms in the manifested world. The same\nthree components are also seen as the primary components of the human\nbeing.\n\nIn their precosmic aspects, shen, qi, and\njing (in this order) represent three consecutive stages in\nthe process of the generation of the cosmos, from the initial state of\nNon-Being and Emptiness (wu, xu) to the coagulation\nof the Essence that finally generates the \u201cten thousand\nthings\u201d. Shen is the principle that presides over\nnon-material entities (including the celestial deities, which are also\ncalled shen, \u201cspirits\u201d or \u201cgods\u201d);\njing is the principle that presides over material entities;\nand qi is the principle that maintains the whole cosmos for\nits entire extent and duration and throughout its continuous changes.\nUnder these aspects, jing, qi, and shen are\nusually prefixed by the word yuan, \u201coriginal\u201d\n(yuanjing, yuanqi, yuanshen). In certain\ncases, Original Breath (yuanqi) is also seen as a principle\nprior to the emergence of Essence, Breath, and Spirit; when it is used\nin this sense, it is also called Ancestral Breath (zuqi) and\nis equated to the Dao itself.\n\nIn the manifested world, the three components take on different\naspects. With regard to the human being, shen emerges as the\nmind (the \u201ccognitive spirit\u201d, shishen, or\n\u201cthinking spirit\u201d, sishen); qi appears\nas breath; and the main materializations of jing are\u2014in\naddition to other liquid components of the body, such as saliva and\ntears\u2014semen in men and menstrual blood in women.\n",
