    "main_text": "The Big Five\n3. The Big Five\n\nBack to psychology for a moment. As time went on, the situationist\nmovement ended up not ushering in the downfall of the study of\npersonality. In fact, global character traits have come to dominate\nthe field of personality psychology. The primary reason for this has\nbeen the emergence of the Big Five or Five-Factor model. Today the Big\nFive personality traits are all the rage, with thousands of papers\nappearing in journals in recent years. Now one sees the study of\nglobal personality traits described in terms of a\n\u201crenaissance\u201d with \u201creal progress toward\nconsensus\u201d after \u201cdecades of floundering\u201d (McCrae\nand Costa 2003: 21, 20, 2008: 159).\n\nSurprisingly, though, philosophers have said almost nothing about the\nBig Five (for exceptions see Doris 2002: 67\u201371; Snow 2010:\n11\u201312; Slingerland 2011: 397; Miller 2014: chapter 6). This\nsection first provides some background from the psychology literature,\nbefore raising some relevant philosophical issues.\n",
