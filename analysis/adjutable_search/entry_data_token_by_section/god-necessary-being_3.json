    "main_text": "God\u2019s Grounding Abstract Objects I: Views on Which Necessarily Existing Abstracta Are All Grounded in God || Theistic Voluntarism\n3.1 Theistic Voluntarism\n\nAccording to the theistic voluntarist, necessarily existing abstract\nobjects depend on the divine will, or some other contingent feature of\nGod. This is famously the view of Descartes. In a letter to Mersenne\n(27 May 1630), Descartes says:\n\n\nYou ask me by what kind of causality God established the eternal\ntruths. I reply: by the same kind of causality as he created all\nthings, that is to say, as their efficient and total cause. For it is\ncertain that he is the author of the essence of created things no less\nthan of their existence; and this essence is nothing other than the\neternal truths. I do not conceive them as emanating from God like rays\nfrom the sun; but I know that God is the author of everything and that\nthese truths are something and consequently that he is their author.\n(Descartes 1991: 25)\n\n\nDescartes makes the same sorts of claims in his public writings, as\nwell (e.g., in the reply to the Sixth Set of Objections (also from\nMersenne)). This view seems to take seriously that God truly is\nmaximally powerful; he even has volitional control over things like\nnumbers, properties, and states of affairs. Indeed, even more than\nwith views like theistic emanationism is God in control of abstracta\non this view. According to the theistic voluntarist, God could have\nmade different\u2014or no\u2014abstracta like propositions,\nproperties, and states of affairs. God is in control of abstracta like\nGod is in control of any other object: Their existence is subject to\nGod\u2019s will.\n\nOf course, the seriousness with which the theistic voluntarist takes\ndivine aseity and sovereignty is also the source of problems for the\nview. If God could have failed to make the number 2, in what sense is\n2 a necessary being? One might try to weaken the voluntarist view, by\nclaiming that 2 is only weakly necessary: God had to create it, but it\nis possibly\u2026possible that it not exist. All worlds that are\naccessible to the actual world have 2 existing in them. But some of\nthese worlds have a somewhat-different divine will relative to the\nexistence of 2 (maybe God somewhat-reluctantly wills the existence of\n2 in them). And possible relative to those sorts of worlds (or\nrelative to worlds possible to those worlds, etc.) are worlds in which\nGod doesn\u2019t will that 2 exist. The key here is that the claim:\nNecessarily, 2 exists comes out true on this picture; 2\nexists in every possible world relative to the world of evaluation\n(the actual world). But there are possibly\u2026possible worlds in\nwhich God doesn\u2019t will the existence of 2. The voluntarist can\nsay that abstracta depend on the will of God, and yet really do exist\nnecessarily (just don\u2019t say in every possible world,  full\nstop (see Plantinga 1980: 95 ff. for further discussion)).\n\nOf course, this suggestion risks two sorts of problems. The first is\nthat it doesn\u2019t take divine sovereignty seriously enough.\nImagine a being who could\u2014in a world possible relative to the\nactual world\u2014make it the case that 2 doesn\u2019t exist. That\nbeing might be thought to be more powerful than a being that only\npossibly\u2026possibly could do this. And Descartes (in places, at\nleast) seems to have this intuition; and thus plumps for a God who\ncould make it the case that 2 didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe second concern is that it abandons S5-type modal logic, in which\nanything that is necessary is necessarily necessary. This is thought\nby many to be the appropriate system of modal logic to describe the\nway actual modality\n is.[9]\n So there are concerns from both sides for this reply to the objection\nto voluntarism. On the one hand, it might be thought not to take\ndivine power seriously enough. On the other, it might not make\nabstracta \u201cnecessary enough\u201d.\n\nOne reason why Descartes is famous for holding to theistic voluntarism\nview is because so few others in the history of theological thought\nhold to it. And perhaps the main reason why no one else holds to it is\nbecause many judge that the theistic voluntarist isn\u2019t able to\naccount for the absolute necessity of necessarily existing abstracta.\nThese are objects that if they exist should exist in every possible\nworld, full stop; and once one allows for that, it makes it very\ndifficult to see how it could be up to God\u2019s will that these\nexist. Rather, if they are up to God; one winds up with a view like theistic emanationism. We\nturn to it.\n",
