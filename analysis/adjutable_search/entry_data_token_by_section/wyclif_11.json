    "main_text": "Theology || Divine omnipotence\n4.2 Divine omnipotence\n\nThis doctrine of divine ideas and the connected theory of being had a\nsignificant result also for the notion of divine omnipotence. In the\nMiddle Ages, one of the most important features of divine omnipotence\nwas the capacity of annihilating, which was viewed as the necessary\ncounterpart of the divine capacity of creating. Wyclif denies the\nthesis of an opposition between creation and annihilation, and\nexplicitly denies that God can annihilate creatures. He argues that\nnothing is contrary to creation, since the act of creating is peculiar\nto God, and nothing is opposite or contrary to God. In fact,\nabsolute non-being (the only \u201cthing\u201d that could\nbe considered opposite to God) is something self-contradictory, and\ntherefore logically impossible. Accordingly, there cannot be any\naction opposite to creation. The only possible kind of non-being\nadmitted by Wyclif is corruption (corruptio), that is, the\nnatural destruction of the actual existence in time of an object in\nthe world (Tractatus de universalibus, chap. 13, pp.\n302\u20133).\n\nOn the other hand, according to Wyclif, annihilation, if possible,\nwould be equivalent to the total destruction of all of a\ncreature\u2019s levels of being (ibid., p. 307), and thus\nwould imply the following absurdities:\n\nGod could not annihilate any creature without destroying the whole\nworld at once, since universal-being is the basic constitutive element\nof the second level of being (the esse essentiae or esse\nin genere) of each creature (ibid., pp.\n307\u20138).\nSince annihilation would be nothing but an accident, and more\nprecisely an action, it would be really different from both the acting\nsubject (i.e. God) and the object of the action (i.e., the thing that\nwould be annihilated). But any accident requires a substrate of\ninherence. In this case, it cannot be God. Thus, it must be the object\nof annihilation. Yet, because of its particular nature, if there is\nannihilation, its substrate of inherence cannot be, and therefore the\nannihilation itself cannot be, since no accident can exist without any\nsubstrate of inherence \u2014 an apparently self-contradictory state\nof affairs (ibid., pp. 310\u201311).\nGod could not annihilate any creature without annihilating Himself\nat the same time, because the first and most basic level of being of\nevery creature is rooted in the divine essence itself (ibid.,\npp. 313\u201314).\n\n\nThe image of God Wyclif draws here is not the Christian image of the\nLord of the universe, who freely creates by an act of His will and has\nabsolute power and control over everything, but a variation of the\nNeoplatonic notion of the One. Wyclif\u2019s God is simply the\nsupreme principle of the universe from which everything necessarily\nflows. Within Wyclif\u2019s system, creation is a form of emanation,\nas each creature is necessarily connected with the divine essence\nitself by means of its esse ideale. God has been deprived of\nthe power of revocation (ibid., pp. 304\u20135), and the\nonly action He can, or rather has to, perform is creation. Because of\nthe necessary links between (i) the divine essence and the eternal\nmental being that every creature has in God and (ii) this first level\nof being of creatures and the remaining three, for God to think of\ncreatures is already to create them. But God cannot help thinking of\ncreatures, since to think of Himself is to think of His constitutive\nprinciples, that is, of the ideas of creatures. Therefore, God cannot\nhelp creating. Indeed, He could not help creating just this\nuniverse.\n\nWyclif\u2019s rejection of the possibility of annihilation and the\nsubsequent new notion of divine onnipotence shed light on his theory\nof universals, as they help us to appreciate the difference between\nhis thesis of the identity between universals and individuals and the\nanalogous thesis of moderate Realists. For these latter theses, this\nidentity meant that the individuals are in potentia\nuniversal; for Wyclif it means that the individuals are\nthe universals qua existing in actu \u2014\nthat is, the individuals are the outcome of a process of production\nthat is inscribed into the nature of general essences themselves, and\nthrough which general essences change from an incomplete type of\nsubsistence as forms to a full existence as individuals. This position\nis consistent with (i) his theory of substance, where the main and\nbasic composition of every substance, both individual and universal,\nis not the hylemorphic one, but the composition of potency and act\n(De ente praedicamentali, chap. 5, pp. 38\u201339), and (ii)\na Neoplatonic reading of Aristotelian metaphysics, where universal\nsubstances, and not individual ones as the Stagirite had taught, are\nthe main and fundamental kind of being (on Wyclif\u2019s doctrine of\nthe divine omnipotence see A. D. Conti, \u201cAnnihilatio e\ndivina onnipotenza nel Tractatus de universalibus di\nJohn Wyclif,\u201d in MT. Fumagalli Beonio Brocchieri & S.\nSimoneta 2003, pp.71\u201385.\n",
