    "main_text": "The System of Positive Polity and the Complete Positivism || Ethics and sociology\n5.4 Ethics and sociology\n\nPositivism asserted very early its wish to construct a moral doctrine\nthat owes nothing to the supernatural. If we need a spiritual power,\nit is because social questions are quite often moral rather than\npolitical. The reforms of society must be made in a determined order:\none has to change ideas, then morals (les moeurs; the word is\ndifficult to translate: it is something like ways of acting, habits,\nles us et coutumes), and only then institutions. But with the\nSystem, the moral doctrine (ethics) changes status and\nbecomes a science, whose task is to extend sociology in order to take\nindividual phenomena into account, in particular affective ones.\n\nThe terms of the problem as well as its solution are given by a saying\nto be found in the margin of the cerebral table: \u201cAct from\naffection and think in order to act\u201d (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1,\n594). The first part of this \u201csystematic verse\u201d is\nguaranteed by the dominance of the heart; but, among the ten\n\u201caffective forces\u201d, the first seven correspond to egoism,\nthe final three to altruism. The whole question is knowing which ones\nwould prevail, those of \u201cpersonality\u201d or those of\n\u201csociability\u201d. While it is important to acknowledge the\ninnateness of the sympathetic instincts, one is forced to admit their\nnative weakness: the supremacy of the egoistic tendencies is so clear\nthat it is itself one of the most striking traits in our nature. The\ngreat human problem is to reverse the natural order and to teach\nourselves to live for others.\n\nThe solution consists in \u2018regulating the inside through the\noutside\u2019 and depends, as a consequence, on a good use of the\nmind. The only way in which altruism can win, is to ally itself with\nthe mind, to make it its servant and not its slave. The heart, without\nthe light of reason, is blind. Left to itself, affectivity is\ncharacterized by its inconsistency and instability. That is why the\ninside has to be regulated, that is, disciplined. And this task is\nassigned to the outside, because exterior reality is the best of\nregulators. Whatever its own defects may be, the order that science\ndiscloses in nature is, by its indifference to our desires, a source\nof discipline. The recognition of an unchanging external order thus\nbecomes \u2018the objective base of true human wisdom\u2019, and\n\u2018in the obligation to conform themselves to it\u2019 our\naffections find \u2018a source of fixedness appropriate for\ncontrolling their spontaneous capriciousness, and a direct stimulation\nto the dominance of the sympathetic instincts\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 322;\nE., v. 1, 257). Science now finds itself vested with a moral function;\nbut that also means that \u2018thoughts must be systematized before\nfeelings\u2019 (1851, v. 1, 21; E., v. 1, 17) and that, if moral\nascendancy is the primary attribute of the spiritual power, that power\nwould not be able to carry out its duties without the aid of a\nsuperior intellect.\n\nWhile developing a science of morals founded on moral doctrine,\nDurkheim and L\u00e9vy-Bruhl were heavily dependent upon this aspect\nof the System. Like the word \u2018sociology\u2019, the\nword \u2018altruism\u2019 was coined by Comte. Being deeply aware of\nwhat man and animals have in common, Comte was close to what is known\ntoday as \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019: he saw cooperation between\nmen as continuous with phenomena of which biology gives us further\nexamples. The same interest in biology led him to link medicine to\nmoral doctrine and even to religion. In our modern societies, the\nstudy of the human being \u2018is now irrationally parcelled out\namongst three classes of thinkers: the Physicians, who study only the\nbody; the Philosophers, who imagine to study the mind; and the\nPriests, who specially study the heart\u2019 (1852, v. 2, 437; E., v.\n2, 356). To remedy this and to respect the unity of our nature, he\nproposed giving the new clergy a role in medicine, considering for\nexample that there is no better endorsement of a rule of hygiene than\na religious decree. Before dying, he still had the time to outline, in\nhis letters to Audiffrent, the rudiments of a sociological theory of\ndiseases.\n",
