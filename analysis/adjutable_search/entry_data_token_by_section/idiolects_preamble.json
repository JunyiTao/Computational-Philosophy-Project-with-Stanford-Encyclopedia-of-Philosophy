    "main_text": "\n\nFor the purposes of this entry an idiolect is a language the\nlinguistic (i. e. syntactic, phonological, referential, etc.)\nproperties of which can be exhaustively specified in terms of the\nintrinsic properties of some single individual, the person whose\nidiolect it is. The force of \u201cintrinsic\u201d is to exclude\nessential reference to features of the person\u2019s wider\nenvironment, and in particular to their linguistic community.\n\nSome hold that idiolects in this sense do not exist or that the notion\nis useless or incoherent, but are nonetheless happy to use the word\n\u201cidiolect\u201d to describe a person\u2019s partial grasp of,\nor their pattern of deviance from, a language that is irreducibly\nsocial in nature. The substantial debate, here, is not over how to\ndefine a word. It turns, rather, on whether an idiolectal perspective\non language is to be preferred to a non-idiolectal one. Someone taking\nan idiolectal perspective on language treats idiolects (in something\nlike the first sense) as having ontological or investigative priority\nover social languages, conceiving of the latter as nothing but\nmore-or-less overlapping idiolects. Someone taking a non-idiolectal\nperspective will see social languages as ontologically distinct from\nand prior to the individual idiolects of those who speak them. At\nissue, then, is what we should take languages to be.\n\nThe terms of the debate are not quite as simple as this implies. There\nis scope, for example, for a spectrum of views. Perhaps we should be\nidiolectal when thinking about language acquisition but not when\nthinking about the reference of proper names. Perhaps too we should\nrecognize two kinds of linguistic content, only one of\nwhich\u2014narrow content\u2014is best thought of in idiolectal\nterms. Moreover, even someone taking a strongly idiolectal stance will\nwant to qualify the definition of \u201cidiolect\u201d given\nabove\u2014by tying its properties to a person at a specified time,\nin a specified social setting, or on a specified occasion, for\nexample, or by treating the idiolect as belonging not to a concrete\nindividual speaker, replete with a suite of performance errors, but to\na person who is in some respects an idealization and an\nabstraction.\n\nSeveral important debates feature talk of languages that are more\nidiolectal than social. Some are considered in detail in other entries\n(see the entries on\n the language of thought hypothesis,\n private language, and\n externalism about mental content).\n This entry will concentrate instead on one extremely influential\nnon-idiolectal view (Lewis\u2019s account of languages as\nconventions, Section 2, which also discusses Davidson\u2019s\nanti-conventionalism) and one extremely influential idiolectal view\n(Chomsky\u2019s notion of an I-language, Section 3). The entry begins\nin Section 1 with some general remarks about the ontology of\nlanguages.\n",
