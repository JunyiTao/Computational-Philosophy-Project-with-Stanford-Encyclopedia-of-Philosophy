    "main_text": "The Legacy from Antiquity || Charleton and the Seventeenth-Century Revival of Atomism\n2.4 Charleton and the Seventeenth-Century Revival of Atomism\n\n An important representative of the revival of atomism and its\nconcomitant views concerning the void is Walter Charleton's\nPhysiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana: Or a Fabrick of Science\nNatural, upon the Hypothesis of Atoms, \u201cFounded by Epicurus, Repaired\nby Petrus Gassendus, Augmented by Walter Charleton\u201d, which\nappeared in English in 1654, twelve years after Newton's birth. It is\na text with which Newton became familiar as an undergraduate, and some\nof the core theses concerning time and space later put forth in the\nPrincipia and various unpublished manuscripts in Newton's hand can be\nfound in Charleton.  These include: \n\nthat time and space are real entities even though they fit neither\nof the traditional categories of substance or accident (i.e., property\nof a substance),\nthat time \u201cflow[s] on eternally in the same calm and equal tenor,\u201d\nwhile the motion of all bodies is subject to \u201cacceleration,\nretardation, or suspension\u201d,\nthat time is distinct from any measure of it, e.g., celestial\nmotion or the solar day,\nthat space is \u201cabsolutely immoveable\u201d and incorporeal,\nthat bodies, or \u201cCorporeal Dimensions\u201d are everywhere \u201cCoexistent\nand Compatient\u201d with the \u201cDimensions\u201d of the parts of space they\noccupy,\nthat space distinct from body existed before God created the world\nand that God's omnipresence is his literal presence everywhere, and \nthat motion is the translation or migration of body from one\nplace, as an immovable part of space, to another.\n\n\n Charleton's arguments for his views concerning time have much the\nsame tenor as those given by Newton in the Principia. In\nmarked contrast, though, those for empty, immense, and immutable space\nare quite different. Charleton appeals to the explanation of such\nphenomena as rarefaction and condensation, the differences in \u201cdegrees\nof Gravity\u201d of bodies, and the numerous ways in which bodies can\ninterpenetrate at the micro-level in terms of solubility, absorption,\ncalefaction, and diverse chemical reactions. However, Charleton does\nnot introduce the terminology of \u201crelative\u201d time, \u201crelative\u201d spaces,\nor \u201crelative\u201d places, and nowhere raises concerns regarding true\n(absolute) motion versus merely relative motion. Oddly enough,\nalthough Charleton occasionlly mentions and criticizes Descartes with\nregard to other matters, no note of the fact is made that Descartes, a\ndecade earlier, had proposed explanations, in detail or in outline,\nfor just these sorts phenomena according to a system of nature in\nwhich the world is completely filled with matter and in which space\ndistinct from body cannot exist. Descartes, it can be justly said, is\nthe founder of the other main school of the \u201cmechancal philosophy\u201d of\nthe 17th Century, which stood in direct opposition to atomism on the\nissue of the possibility of a vacuum and which adapted the\nAristotelian doctrines on the nature of time, space, and motion to the\nnew world view.\n",
