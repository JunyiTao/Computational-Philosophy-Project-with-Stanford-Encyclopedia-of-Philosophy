    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Externalization\n5.5 Externalization\n\nThe final operation of the creative process\u2014externalizing\nideas\u2014may involve any number of disparate activities, which\nKeith Sawyer sums up as follows:\n\n\nCreativity research has tended to focus on the early stages of the\neight-stage creative process\u2014particularly on the idea-generating\nstage. But a lot has to happen to make any idea a reality. Successful\ncreators are skilled at executing their ideas, predicting how others\nmight react to them and being prepared to respond, identifying the\nnecessary resources to make them successful, forming plans for\nimplementing the ideas, and improvising to adjust their plans as new\ninformation arrives. These activities are important in all creativity,\nbut are likely to be even more important in practical domains such as\ntechnological invention and entrepreneurship (Mumford, 2003;\nPolicastro & Gardner, 1999). (Sawyer 2012: 133\u20134)\n\n\nIt may be tempting to assume that the real creative work is finished\nonce a new idea emerges in the moment of insight, and that\nexternalization is just the uncreative, mechanical chore of making the\nidea public. But a closer look at the phenomenon reveals that\nexternalization is often integral to creativity itself.\n\nVera John-Steiner (1985) interviewed, and examined the notebooks of,\nover 70 exceptional creators (ranging from author Ana\u00efs Nin to\ncomposer Aaron Copland), and consulted the notebook of another 50\neminent historical creators such as Leo Tolstoy and Marie Curie. A\nrecurring theme throughout was that at the beginning of each creative\nendeavor and continually throughout its development, creators\nmanipulate and build upon their impressions, inklings, and tentative\nhunches using sketches, outlines, and other external\nrepresentations.\n\nPerkins (1981) corroborated this finding by analyzing the 61 sketches\nPicasso made en route to painting his famous work, Guernica,\nas well as Beethoven\u2019s musical drafts and Darwin\u2019s\nnotebooks. In each case, the artist progressed by engaging with\nexternal representations.\n\nOther studies found that people discovered and solved more problem\nwhen they used sketches during a task (Verstijnen 1997), and that\npeople come up with better ideas for improving inventions when they\nwork with visual diagrams (Mayer 1989).\n\nOne reason externalization is so vital to substantial creative work is\nbecause of our limited capacity to consciously hold and manipulate\ninformation in our minds. It helps to offload ideas and store them in\nthe form of physical symbols and expressions in order to free up space\nfor the mind to examine those ideas at arm\u2019s length while\nentertaining new ones. Thus research shows that internal strategies\nlike mental visualization can help with relatively simple tasks, but\nfor more complex projects externalization is key (Finke et al. 1992:\n60).\n",
