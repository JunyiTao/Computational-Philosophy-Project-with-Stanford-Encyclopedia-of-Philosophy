Smith begins the book with an account of sympathy,\nwhich he describes as arising when we imagine how we would feel in the\ncircumstances of others. (A rich discussion of Smith on sympathy can\nbe found in Griswold 1999, ch.2; see also Fleischacker 2019, chapter\n2.) This is somewhat different from Hume\u2019s account, on which\nsympathy normally consists in feeling what others actually\nfeel in their circumstances. Hume\u2019s may be called a\n\u201ccontagion\u201d account of sympathy, while Smith\u2019s is a\n\u201cprojective\u201d account (see Fleischacker 2012 and\n2019). Smith\u2019s projective account opens up the possibility that\nour feelings on another person\u2019s behalf may often not match the\nfeelings she herself has. Indeed to some extent they will never match,\nsince imagining oneself into a set of circumstances will always lack\nthe intensity of actually experiencing those circumstances (TMS\n21\u20132). This difference is of great importance to Smith, since he\nmaintains that trying to share the feelings of others as closely as\npossible is one of our main drives in life. We make constant efforts\nto adjust our feelings, as spectators, to those of the people\n\u201cprincipally concerned\u201d in a set of circumstances\n(importantly, these include people acted upon as well as agents), and\nto adjust our feelings as people principally concerned to a level with\nwhich sympathetic spectators can go along (110\u201313,\n135\u20136). It is this process of mutual emotional adjustment that\ngives rise to virtue: the \u201cawful\u201d virtues of\nself-restraint, insofar as the people principally concerned keep\nthemselves from feeling, or at least expressing, the full flood of\ntheir grief or joy, and the \u201camiable\u201d virtues of\ncompassion and humanity, insofar as the spectators strive to\nparticipate in the joys and sufferings of others (23\u20135).\n\nNeither the feelings we seek to have nor the standards\nby which we judge feelings need be identical with the feelings\nand standards that are actually current in our society. We know that\nmany actual spectators misjudge our situations out of ignorance or\ninterest, so we seek to judge, and act on, just the feelings that a\nwell-informed and impartial spectator would have (TMS 129,\n135). Smith thinks that to sympathize with another\u2019s feelings is\nto approve of those feelings (17), and to sympathize as we think an\nimpartial spectator would is to approve morally of\nthose feelings. Moral norms thus express the feelings of an impartial\nspectator. A feeling, whether on the part of a person motivated to\ntake an action or on the part of a person who has been acted upon by\nothers, is worthy of moral approval if and only if an impartial\nspectator would sympathize with that feeling. (Again, people acted\nupon are subject to moral judgment as well as agents; reactions can be\njudged as well as actions.) When achieving a morally right feeling is\ndifficult, we call that achievement \u201cvirtuous\u201d; otherwise,\nwe describe people as acting or failing to act within the bounds of\n\u201cpropriety\u201d (25). Thus do moral norms and ideals, and the\njudgments by which we guide ourselves towards those norms and ideals,\narise out of the process by which we try to achieve mutual\nsympathy.\n\nSmith distinguishes two kinds of normative guides to action: rules and\nvirtues. Moral rules, formed on the basis of our reactions to specific\ninstances (we say to ourselves, \u201cI\u2019ll never do\nthat\u201d), bar certain especially egregious kinds of\nbehavior\u2014murder, rape, theft\u2014and provide a framework of\nshared expectations for society (156\u201366). They are essential to\njustice, especially, without which societies could not survive. They\nalso enable people who are not fully virtuous to behave with a minimum\nof decorum and decency (162\u20133), and help all of us cut through\nthe \u201cveil of self-delusion\u201d (158) by which we misrepresent\nour situations to ourselves. Virtue requires more than simply\nfollowing moral rules, however. Our emotional dispositions need to be\nre-configured so that we do not merely \u201caffect\u201d the\nsentiments of the impartial spectator but \u201cadopt\u201d those\nsentiments: identify ourselves with, become, the impartial spectator,\ninsofar as that is possible (147). If we are truly virtuous, a\nsubmission to certain rules will constrain everything we do, but\nwithin that framework we will operate without rules, trying instead to\nmold ourselves with the know-how by which an artist molds his clay,\nsuch that we develop dispositions to proper gratitude, kindness,\ncourage, patience, and endurance.\n\nThis is a picture that owes a great deal to Hume and Joseph Butler,\nbut gets worked out by Smith in much greater detail. It has been\nhailed by some as an especially sensible recognition of the kind and\ndegree of virtue appropriate to modern liberal politics and commercial\nsociety (Berry 1992; McCloskey 2006). Others see a darker, more\npessimistic attitude towards virtue in Smith, echoing the kinds of\nworries to be found in Rousseau about the corruption wrought by\ncommerce (Dwyer 1987, chapter 7). Still others argue that\nSmith\u2019s account of virtue re-works but to a remarkable degree\nalso retains the highest ideals of both the Christian and the ancient\nGreco-Roman traditions, suggesting that his willingness to uphold such\nan ideal of character even in modern commercial societies should be\nunderstand as a critique rather than an endorsement of Rousseau\n(Hanley 2009).\n\nIn any case, Smith gives us more a virtue ethics than a rule-based\nmoral system along the lines proposed by Kant and the utilitarians.\nNevertheless, he tries to incorporate some of the intuitions that\ngenerated these other systems. As we have seen, he thinks that we need\nto submit to general rules, and his reasons for supposing that relying\non sentiment alone can feed our self-deceit anticipate Kant\u2019s\ncritique of moral sentimentalism in the Groundwork (see\nFleischacker 1991). Smith also acknowledges that we in fact judge\nactions by their effects as well as their intentions, and thinks this\nsort of judgment is appropriate as long as we look at effects\nas they are intended, and not just as they happen to occur.\nThe \u201cmerit\u201d of actions, he says in Book II of TMS, depends\non their consequences, even if their propriety is independent of\nconsequences; the point, for him, is just that these are two\ndifferent elements of moral judgment and the first is of\ngreater importance than the second (188). Having insisted on this, he\ngrants that in some cases the consequences of an action\u2014where\nthey threaten the very survival of our society, for instance\u2014may\ntrump all other considerations (90\u201391).\n\nIn line with his concern for accurate moral phenomenology, Smith also\ntries to make sense of the role that religion and culture play in our\nmoral lives. He handles the first of these by explaining why people\nwho come to believe in higher powers will naturally attribute virtues,\nand a concern for our virtue, to those powers (163\u20136). He also\nsays that it adds to the sacredness we attribute to moral rules to see\nthem as laws of the Deity, and to the importance of morality as a\nwhole to see it as a way of \u201cco-operat[ing] with the\nDeity\u201d in the governance of the universe (166). And he shows how\na belief in an afterlife may be necessary if we are to see the\nuniverse as just, which in turn is important if we are to maintain our\ncommitment to the value of acting morally (168\u201370). In all these\nways, but especially the last, he anticipates Kant\u2019s moral\nargument for belief in God, without ever quite saying that there\nis a God. At the same time, he makes clear that any religion\nthat gives priority to ritual or creed over morality is baleful, and\nposes grave dangers to a decent and peaceful society\n(TMS 176\u20137; cf. WN 802\u20133).\n\nSmith handles the importance of culture under the heading of\n\u201ccustom and fashion.\u201d Book V of TMS takes up this topic,\nacknowledging the influence of prevailing opinions in each society\nover all sorts of value judgments, and granting that what is regarded\nas virtuous will vary to some extent in accordance with this\ninfluence. The French value politeness more than the Russians, and the\nDutch value frugality more than the Poles (TMS 204). The leisured\nclasses in every country tend to be less strict about sexual mores\nthan the working classes (WN 794). These are easily explicable\ndifferences, and not worrisome ones: they are matters of emphasis, and\ncannot affect \u201cthe general style of conduct or behaviour\u201d\nof a society. That general style of conduct cannot vary in its\nessentials. No society could survive otherwise (TMS 209, 211).\n\nPart VI of TMS, added in the last edition, presents the virtues of\nprudence, benevolence and self-command by way of a series of elegant\ncharacter portraits, and part VII offers a short history of moral\nphilosophy, which stresses the contributions of Plato, Aristotle, and\nthe Stoics. This way of concluding the book reinforces the emphasis on\nvirtuous character, as opposed to a decision-procedure for specific\nactions, and indicates that we might gain by returning to the ancient\nschools of moral philosophy that shared this emphasis. Smith does not\nendorse any ancient moral theorist uncritically, but\u2014like\nShaftesbury and Hume\u2014he seems to look forward to a revival of\nancient Greek ethics, a modern retrieval and re-working of the\ncharacter ideals on which those schools had focused.\n",
