    "main_text": "Semantics || Cognitive Significance and Identification\n2.2 Cognitive Significance and Identification\n\nAnother issue we must disentangle from the semantics of names is that\nof their cognitive significance and allied\nbehavior in opaque contexts, including especially attitude reports\n(see the entry on Propositional Attitude Reports).\n\nNames that corefer do not always communicate the same information. For\ninstance, to one who is ignorant of the fact that the names\n\u201cHesperus\u201d (i.e., the Evening Star) and\n\u201cPhosphorus\u201d (i.e., the Morning Star) both refer to the\nplanet Venus, the sentence \u201cHesperus is a planet\u201d and the\nsentence \u201cPhosphorus is a planet\u201d transmit different\ninformation, producing different cognitive states and resultant action\n(Frege 1892). One who mishears an utterance of one of these sentences,\nmistaking it for the other, has misunderstood the speaker, despite\narriving at an interpretation that is extensionally correct (Loar\n1976).\n\nMoreover, coreferring names may be used with distinguishing import\neven by those in the know. When (in Wharton\u2019s novel) Miranda\nfalls upon the Abbot\u2019s mercy, and admits she has been playing\nthe part of a man to sidestep an ecclesiastical restriction on female\nperformers, he mercifully lifts the ban:\n\n\nMy only condition,\u201d he added with a truly paternal smile,\n\u201cis that, after the Signorina Miranda\u2019s performance at the\ntheatre her twin brother the Signor Mirandolo shall return every\nevening to the monastery. (Wharton, The Valley of\nDecision)\n\n\nThe Abbot\u2019s condition is not met unless Miranda returns to the\nmonastery each night in male guise (compare Saul 2007).\n\nRelatedly, coreferring names cannot always be substituted salva\nveritate in the context of a propositional attitude report (Frege\n1892). If Daphnis doesn\u2019t know that Hesperus is Phosphorus, then\nit could be true that\n\n(1) Daphnis believes\nthat Hesperus appears in the evening.\n\n\nWhile being false that\n\n(2) Daphnis believes\nthat Phosphorus appears in the evening.\n\n\nThese observations are connected with the main question of this\nsection\u2014do names have meanings? For names with the same\nreference could yet differ in meaning, and this might explain their\ndiffering cognitive significance. In particular, if a name\u2019s\nmeaning is (part of) what it contributes to the truth condition of an\nutterance, then a difference in meaning, in spite of an equivalence in\nreference, could lead to a different truth-value for the sentence.\n\nNevertheless, we will not consider this source of evidence for nominal\nmeaning further in the article. In the first place, the phenomena just\nrecounted are general to all kinds of referring expression (and\nperhaps other sorts of expression too), rather than being particular\nto names, and so their discussion properly belongs under a more\ngeneral head. Second, in cases where we are less uncertain that\nmeaning exists, it does not seem to correspond to cognitive\nsignificance. For example, given the right scenario,\n\u201cbachelor\u201d and the phrase documenting its\nmeaning\u2014\u201cman who has not been married\u201d\u2014would\nalso fail to substitute salva veritate in an attitude report.\nFinally, the debate over cognitive significance devolves into a\nstalemate, as any detailed explanation of the phenomena that relies on\nnames having meanings can be approximated by one that relies instead\non information which, while associated with a name, is not considered\nits meaning (Soames 2002).\n\nI will substantiate the last point at length, by considering a\nparticular account of the cognitive significance of names. The account\nrelates cognitive significance to the identifying\ninformation associated with a specific name in an agent\u2019s\nmind (Strawson 1974: 43ff). To illustrate this, suppose I know of two\nindividuals bearing the name \u201cZera Yacob\u201d. Most likely, I\nassociate a different sobriquet, or description, with each specific\nversion of the name, as a way of maintaining the distinction in my\nmind. Moreover, whenever I speak or hear the name \u201cZera\nYacob\u201d, I implicitly associate the utterance with one of those\ndescriptions; either it is the seventeenth century philosopher or the\nfifteenth century Emperor of Ethiopia who is being named in this\ninstance. Plausibly, I cannot felicitously utter \u201cZera\nYacob\u201d without selecting either the prince or the philosopher as\nmy intended referent, and I can\u2019t fully interpret\nanother\u2019s utterance of the name without forming a parallel\ndetermination.\n\nIf each specific name is annexed to some identifying\ninformation\u2014enough to single out its bearer at least in the mind\nof the agent\u2014then this could explain the different cognitive\nsignificances of coreferring names. But does the identifying sobriquet\nalso represent the meaning of the name? There are several reasons to\ndoubt that it does. First, different agents might well associate\ndifferent identifying information with the same referring use of a\nname (Frege 1892), which would seem to conflict with the natural\nassumption that a name like \u201cSocrates\u201d has a single\nmeaning throughout a community. Different responses are available\nhere. We might say that the meaning of a name is relative to the\nidiolect of the individual, rather than the dialect of the group.\nAnother option would be to claim that the meaning of a name in a\npublic language is aggregated in some way from the identifying\ninformation associated with it by each member of the relevant public\n(Strawson 1959: 191\u2013192). Note that, on the latter sort of\naccount, it would be possible for a user (or even every user) of the\nname to only have a partial grip on its (aggregate) meaning (see\n Section 2.3).\n\nSecond, information that is sufficient for identificational purposes\n(internally distinguishing one bearer of a name from another) may yet\nbe inadequate to determine the extension of a name (Strawson 1959:\n20\u201321). For instance, \u201cthe Roman author\u201d is enough\nto distinguish Marcus Tullius Cicero from Cicero, Illinois; but it is\nnot sufficient to select a unique Cicero in the world (Kripke 1980:\n81; Donnellan 1970: 343). There is, for instance, Cicero\u2019s\nyounger brother, Quintus Tullius Cicero, also an author of several\nworks.\n\nA description can also have the identifying function though it is\nfalse of the proper referent of the specific name. For instance, many\nwould have inaccurately identified Christopher Columbus as the first\nEuropean to visit the Americas (Searle 1958: 168; Strawson 1964: 102;\nDonnellan 1970: 341; Kripke 1980: 83\u201384).\n\nIf the feature used for identificational purposes is false of the\nreferent of the name, then by our earlier criterion it cannot serve as\nthe meaning of the name. If it is true, but insufficient to\ndiscriminate the referent, then the situation is different. It is\npossible to claim that the identifying feature is the meaning of the\nname, while admitting that nominal meaning merely constrains, without\nfully determining, nominal reference. Names would then be akin to\ncertain pronouns (arguably, the meaning of \u201cshe\u201d merely\nlimits its possible referents in certain respects).\n\nThus, it is possible to find a place in one\u2019s theory for\nidentifying descriptions, and even use them to explain cognitive\nsignificance, while still denying that they correspond to the meanings\nof names. Strawson himself, who developed the account of\nidentification on display, and who thought that a name\u2019s\nreference was determined by its associated identifying description\n(1959: 181\u2013182), did not conceive of that description as\nexpressing the name\u2019s meaning (1950: 340).\n\nMore generally, suppose we call whatever theoretical posit captures\nthe cognitive significance of names, sense,\nfollowing Frege. The crucial point is that we need not conflate the\nlinguistic meaning of a name with its sense (Kripke 1980: 59; Burge\n1977). This is so even if we take a name to contribute its sense to\nthe truth condition of an attitude report, as Frege also suggested.\nRemember, we understand meaning as something that (if present)\ndetermines or constrains the extension of a word. We have refrained\nfrom identifying meaning with a word\u2019s contribution to the truth\ncondition of a declarative sentence (what is usually called its semantic\nvalue). If we had, then it would follow,\nfrom the fact that names do contribute to truth conditions, that names\nhave meanings; and we had wanted to frame the issue of a name\u2019s\nmeaning so that it didn\u2019t have a trivial answer. Instead, we\nhave left open whether a name\u2019s contribution\u2014sense or\nreferent\u2014is determined by its meaning, or else, in the absence\nof such a meaning, by extra-semantic factors, such as use.\n",
