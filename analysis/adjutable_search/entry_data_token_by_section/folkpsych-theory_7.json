    "main_text": "Empirical Findings || Cross-Cultural Psychology\n3.4 Cross-Cultural Psychology\n\nMany studies in cross-cultural psychology reveal apparent\nsocio-cultural variation in FP and FP-related abilities (e.g., Avis\n& Harris 1991; Vinden 1996, 1999, 2002; Naito & Koyama 2006;\nLiu et al. 2008). These empirical results suggest there may be\nimportant differences between the forms of FP used in different\ncultures (Mills 2001). Assessing a body of cross-cultural data\nrelating to FB tests, Mayer and Tr\u00e4uble (2013) reach the cautious\nconclusion that\n\n\nit is not clear whether it is justified to assume a universal onset of\nfalse-belief understanding across cultures. (2013: 22)\n\n\nPlenty of cross-cultural variation has been found when comparing\nnon-Western and Western societies concerning other aspects of\nFP-related understanding. The standard explanation for such\ndifferences is put down to the fact that the\n\n\nearly social experiences of children [in such societies] clearly\ndiffer from the experiences of children in Western cultures. (Mayer\n& Tr\u00e4uble 2013: 22; Barrett et al. 2013a, 2013b)\n\n\nConsider, for example, Mayer and Tr\u00e4uble\u2019s (2013) study of\nthe onset of FP understanding in Samoan children. Like other\ncross-cultural researchers, they choose to look at this particular\npopulation precisely because \u201cethnographical work reports\ndifferent practices of intersubjective understanding\u201d (Mayer\n& Tr\u00e4uble 2013: 22). A plausible explanation of differences\nin the timing of the emergence and application of FP-related abilities\nin the Samoan case focuses on how, and how frequently, mental states\nterms are used in that culture. As cultural anthropologists and\nethnographers observe, it is widely asserted in societies of\nthe Pacific that\n\nit is impossible or at least extremely difficult to\nknow what other people think or feel. (Robbins & Rumsey 2008:\n407\u2013408)\n\n\nA possible explanation of Samoan FP-related tendencies is that mental\nstates are talked about less frequently and in different ways in\nSamoan populations than they are in populations with other\nsocio-cultural practices.\n\nAnother line of research reveals that belief understanding varies in\ncertain Eastern populations (Hong Kong, Japan) when compared with\ntheir Western (US, Eastern Europe) counterparts (Doan & Wang 2010;\nLiu et al. 2008). Again, this difference may be connected to the fact\nthat different explanatory practices prevail in these societies (Chao\n1994; Bradford et al. 2018). Fiebich (2016) proposes that these\ncultural differences are evident in early mother-child conversations.\nCaretakers from Western cultures seem to favor mentalistic narratives,\nwhereas caretakers from Asian cultures exhibit a preference for\nbehavioral-contextual narratives. For example, when reading a picture\nbook together with their child, European and American mothers tend to\nrefer more often to the mental states of the protagonist (e.g.,\n\u201cthe bear is sad\u201d) rather than to the embodied aspects of\nthose states (e.g., \u201cthe bear has tears on his face\u201d), in\ncontrast to Chinese mothers. This correlates with earlier evidence\nthat suggests children from several non-Western cultures do not employ\nthe familiar Western FP schema, or at least that they do not do as\nreadily or with the same proficiency as Westerners do (Vinden 1996,\n1999; Lillard 1997, 1998; see also Lavelle forthcoming).\n\nOther cross-cultural evidence reported by Wellman and Peterson (2013)\nfound variations in the developmental sequence in which the component\nelements of FP competence are acquired. They observe people can\nunderstand other minds in terms of a range of attitudes, including,\ndiverse desires concerning the same object (Diverse Desires, DD),\ndifferent beliefs about the same situation (Diverse Beliefs, DB), that\nsomething can be true while the person may not know that (Knowledge\nAccess, KA), that something might be true while the person believes\notherwise (False Belief, FB), and that someone can feel one way but\ndisplay a different emotion (Hidden Emotion, HE).\n\nThe order and sequence in which children get a grip on different\nattitudes vary socio-culturally. Based on a series of studies\ninvolving over 500 preschool children in the USA, Canada, Australia,\nand Germany, it was found that 80% of children exhibit a common\npattern of acquisition, developing their FP-related understanding in\nthe following sequence: DD > DB > KA > FB > HE. However,\nit has been discovered that Chinese and Iranian pre-schoolers come by\ntheir FP understanding in a different order, acquiring KA competence\nbefore DB (Shahaeian et al. 2011; Wellman et al. 2006; Wellman 2011).\nOnce again, a possible explanation of these differences ties them to\nlocal conversational-cultural preferences.\n\nTaken together these findings suggest that not all cultures engage in\nall the same FP practices, nor do they do some in the same sequence or\nthe same way. Evidence gleaned from the handful of cross-cultural\nstudies that have been conducted suggests that neither full FP\nunderstanding nor mastery of the concept of belief comes automatically\nor in equal measure to all members of the human species.\n\nLooking at the practices of other cultures, there is apparent\nheterogeneity in the explanatory tendencies and methods used in making\nsense of people\u2019s actions. In some parts of the globe great\nemphasis is placed, for example, on situational, trait-based, and even\nsupernatural explanations factors (Morris & Peng 1994; Lillard\n1997, 1998). The accumulated cross-cultural evidence should make us\ncautious in assuming that all human populations exhibit the same kind\nof FP understanding or use FP to the same extent or for the same\npurposes.\n",
