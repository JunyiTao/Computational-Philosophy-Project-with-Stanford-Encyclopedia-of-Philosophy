    "main_text": "Skepticism in Islamic and Jewish Philosophy || Jewish Philosophy\n3.2 Jewish Philosophy\n\nThere is no strong evidence of any significant skeptical tendencies or\ninterests among medieval Jewish philosophers. Judah Halevi (ca.\n1075\u20131141) discuses skepticism briefly in his Kuzari\nI.4\u20138; in this passage, a character in the poem professes\nskepticism about religious truths, and presents his requirements for\nwhat would count as knowledge. See Kogan (2003).\n\nThere has also been limited discussion of Maimonides as a skeptic.\nSome of it focuses, e.g., on his claims in the Guide for the\nPerplexed 2.24 that humans cannot have knowledge of heavenly\nthings. To take this to imply either a thoroughgoing skepticism or a\nthoroughgoing concern with skepticism, however, is probably too strong\nan inference. For more on this issue, see Ivry (2008) and\nHaliva (2018).\n",
