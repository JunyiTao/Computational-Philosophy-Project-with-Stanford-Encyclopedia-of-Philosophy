    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics || Lewis and Chisholm on Indexical Belief\n4.4 Lewis and Chisholm on Indexical Belief\n\n\nDavid Lewis (1979a) and Roderick Chisholm (1981) independently\ndeveloped theories of indexical belief according to which the things\nthat agents believe are properties rather than propositions.\nThe primary differences between Lewis\u2019s view and Chisholm\u2019s\nview are ontological. Chisholm\u2019s primitive ontology includes\nproperties and relations. Lewis\u2019s does not. It instead includes sets of\npossible objects, such as possible worlds and other individuals. Lewis reduces properties to\nsets of possible objects and relations to sets of \\(n\\)-tuples of possible\nobjects. Lewis\u2019s variant has been more influential, and so we\nconcentrate on his theory below.\n\n\nOn Lewis\u2019s view, believing is self-ascribing. Agents\nself-ascribe properties, so the things they believe are properties. If\nJohn sincerely utters \u2018I am making a mess\u2019, then he\nself-ascribes the property of making a mess, and therefore he believes\nthat property. An agent who seemingly believes a purely general\nqualitative proposition \\(P\\) in fact believes the corresponding\nproperty of being such that \\(P\\). For example, if John sincerely\nutters \u2018Some dogs are brown\u2019, he believes (self-ascribes)\nthe property of being such that some dogs are brown.\n\n\nSome presentations of Lewis\u2019s view replace properties with\nsets of centered worlds (Egan 2006, Ninan 2013). Centered\nworlds are ordered pairs \\(\\langle o, w \\rangle\\) where\n\\(o\\) is an object and \\(w\\) is a world. Suppose, as Lewis\ndoes, that properties are sets of possible objects; alternatively,\nsuppose that a property \\(F\\) is an intension, namely a function\nwhose value at any world \\(w\\) is the set of objects that have\n\\(F\\) at \\(w\\). Then, as Lewis (1979a) points out, believing\na property \\(F\\) is, in a certain sense, equivalent to believing\nthe set of centered worlds \\(\\langle o, w \\rangle\\) such that\n\\(o\\) has \\(F\\) in \\(w\\).\n\n\nAgents cannot directly ascribe properties to individuals other than\nthemselves, for all ascription of properties is self-ascription. But\nunder the right conditions, agents can indirectly ascribe\nproperties to objects other than themselves by self-ascribing\nproperties that (roughly speaking) uniquely describe those other\nobjects. For example, suppose that Mary sees Bill and only Bill. She\nmay then self-ascribe the property of seeing exactly one man such that\nhe is hungry. (More precisely, she may self-ascribe the property of\nbeing an \\(x\\) such that there is exactly one \\(y\\) such that\n\\(y\\) is a man and \\(x\\) sees \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) is\nhungry.) If she does so, then she indirectly ascribes the property of\nbeing hungry to Bill, under the relation of being a man uniquely seen.\nLewis counts the relation of being a man uniquely seen as an\nacquaintance relation. According to Lewis, believing a\nproperty that uniquely determines an object under an acquaintance\nrelation is sufficient for having a de re belief about that\nobject. So, Lewis would say that Mary de re believes of Bill\nthat he is hungry. But Lewis (1979a) also says \u201cBeliefs de\nre are not really beliefs,\u201d for he thinks that de\nre belief is too extrinsic a matter to count as genuine\nbelief.\n\n\nLewis would analyze the messy shopper case as follows. When John\nlooks into the mirror and utters \u2018He is making a mess\u2019, he\nbegins to believe (to self-ascribe) the property of uniquely seeing a\nman in a mirror that is making a mess. However, John does not,\nat that point, believe (self-ascribe) the property of making a mess.\nJohn starts to believe that property only after he has searched for the\nmessy shopper. So, when John utters \u2018I am making a mess\u2019,\nhe begins to believe something (the property of making a mess) that he\ndid not previously believe.\n\n\nLewis and Chisholm do not extend their views of indexical belief to\nthe semantics of indexicals. That is, neither of them claims that the\ncontent of a sentence containing an indexical, in a context, is a\nproperty. Lewis (1980) mentions various semantic values that a semantic\ntheory might assign to a sentence containing an indexical, but none of\nthese semantic values are properties of the sort mentioned by his\ntheory of indexical belief.\n\n\nTurning now to criticisms, Lewis\u2019s and Chisholm\u2019s views\nsay that agents believe properties. Properties are neither true nor\nfalse. But agents, one might object, often believe things that are true\nand false. Neither Lewis nor Chisholm addresses this objection\ndirectly. But Lewis sometimes says that an agent can be right to\nbelieve a property, or that an agent can believe a property truly, and\nhe says this when the relevant agent believes a property that the agent\nhas. This suggests that Lewis would analyze the notion of believing\nsomething that is true with some notion like that of believing\nsomething truly.\n\n\nBoth Lewis and Chisholm hold that whenever an agent has a belief\nabout an object other than herself, she grasps a property that\ndescriptively determines that object. The relevant property need not be\npurely qualitative, for it may relate the object to herself.\nNevertheless, this is a strong form of descriptivism. David Austin\n(1990) presents detailed, putative counterexamples to their views that\nfocus on this descriptivist aspect of their theories.\n\n\nStalnaker (1981, 2008) argues that Lewis\u2019s view entails an\nimplausible incommunicability of belief. Suppose that Mary believes\nthat she is hungry and utters \u2018I am hungry\u2019. On\nLewis\u2019s view, she believes the property of being hungry. Suppose\nBill hears her and agrees with her. He cannot agree with her by\nbelieving what she believes, for if he did, he would believe the\nproperty of being hungry, and so ascribe that property to himself, not\nto Mary. The best that Bill can do is self-ascribe a property that\nrelates himself uniquely to her, such as the property of speaking\nuniquely to a person who is hungry.\n\n\nFor further discussion of Lewis\u2019s view, and modifications of\nit, see Stalnaker 1981, 2008; Ninan 2013; Cappelen and Dever 2013; and\nMagidor forthcoming.\n",
