    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n4. Metaphysics\n\nOckham was a nominalist, indeed he is the person whose name is perhaps\nmost famously associated with nominalism. But nominalism means many\ndifferent things:\n\nA denial of metaphysical universals. Ockham was emphatically a\nnominalist in this sense.\nAn emphasis on reducing one\u2019s ontology to a bare minimum, on\nparing down the supply of fundamental ontological categories. Ockham\nwas likewise a nominalist in this sense.\nA denial of \u201cabstract\u201d entities. Depending on what one\nmeans, Ockham was or was not a nominalist in this sense. He believed\nin \u201cabstractions\u201d such as whiteness and\nhumanity, for instance, although he did not believe they were\nuniversals. (On the contrary, there are at least as many distinct\nwhitenesses as there are white things.) He certainly believed in\nimmaterial entities such as God and angels. He did not believe in\nmathematical (\u201cquantitative\u201d) entities of any kind.\n\n\nThe first two kinds of nominalism listed above are independent of one\nanother. Historically, there have been philosophers who denied\nmetaphysical universals, but allowed (individual) entities in more\nontological categories than Ockham does. Conversely, one might reduce\nthe number of ontological categories, and yet hold that universal\nentities are needed in the categories that remain.\n",
