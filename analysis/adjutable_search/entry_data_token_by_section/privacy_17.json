However, although both\ndiscourses share the critique of individualist conceptions of privacy\nand are interested in more than the individual\u2019s protection of\nprivacy, the latter tackles a different problem. The upshot of the\ndebates around the social dimensions of privacy is the claim that\nprivacy is not (only) a right or need for individuals, but protects,\nand ought to protect relations as well. Not all relations\nmake up a group, and privacy can, in some cases, constitute the very\nrelation it protects, as Roessler and Mokrosinska (2013) argue. James\nRachels and Charles Fried both recognized that privacy has a social\nvalue: relationships can only be protected when certain norms of\nprivacy apply both within relationships and to relationships (Fried\n1968; Rachels 1975). The various norms of informational privacy do not\nmerely regulate the social relationships and roles that we have in\nlife, they actually make them possible. The perspective of the\nindividual seems insufficient to account for many of the concerns\nraised in debates around privacy-invasive technologies. With\never-greater frequency, privacy-invasive technologies have been argued\nto endanger not only individual interests, but also to affect society\nand social life more generally. Therefore, not only the safeguarding\nof individual freedoms, but also the constitution and regulation of\nsocial relationships, are essential to privacy norms (see Roessler\n& Mokrosinska 2015).\n\nFollowing Fried (1968) and his theory describing the relational\ncharacter of the protection of individual privacy, one can argue that,\nwhile endorsing norms of informational privacy which should protect\nindividual privacy, this privacy at the same time plays an essential\nrole in social relations. Therefore, the protection of privacy is not\nalways and not necessarily in conflict with societal interests\n(Roessler & Mokrosinska 2013: 771).\n\nIn recent years, several scholars have taken important steps towards\ndeveloping a social approach to privacy. Arguing that an important\naspect of the significance of informational privacy is that it goes\nbeyond the interests of the individuals it protects, these scholars\nhave emphasized the way in which privacy enables social and\nprofessional relationships, democratic decision-making processes, and\npolitical participation. They have also stressed the necessary role of\nprivacy for cooperation and trust within various associations, such as\neconomic partnerships. Regan, Solove, and Nissenbaum also follow this\nline of thought. Famously, Regan argues that privacy is not only of\nvalue to the individual, but also to society in general. For Regan\nprivacy is a common value, a public value, and also a collective value\n(1995: 213; see Regan 2015: 50; Hughes 2015). Solove claims that\n\n\n[by] understanding privacy as shaped by the norms of society, we can\nbetter see why privacy should not be understood solely as an\nindividual right\u2026 the value of privacy should be understood in\nterms of its contribution to society. (2008: 98, 171fn)\n\n\nSolove believes privacy fosters and encourages the moral autonomy of\ncitizens, a central requirement of governance in a democracy. Regan\n(1995), Solove (2008) and Nissenbaum (2010) took the first steps in\nanalyzing the social dimensions and value of privacy in a democratic\nsociety and are now focusing on the role of privacy in political and\nsocial practice, law, media and communication, healthcare, and the\nmarketplace.\n\nThe social dimensions of privacy also play a crucial role in the\nsocial analysis of the family. DeCew and Moore assess the\npublic/private boundary in the family, given that family conventions\nare among the most crucial for this primary human socialization\nsetting, and also given that structures in the family often are\noppressive, as DeCew points out (see MacKinnon 1989).\n",
