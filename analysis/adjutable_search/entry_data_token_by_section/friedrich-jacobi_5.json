    "main_text": "Main Philosophical Works || The \u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 (1787)\n3.4 The \u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 (1787)\n\nFirst published in 1787 with the German title \u2018David Hume\n\u00fcber den Glauben oder Idealismus und Realismus. Ein\nGespr\u00e4ch\u2019 (\u2018David Hume on Faith, or Idealism and\nRealism. A Dialogue\u2019), this work includes three distinct\nsections, although only two are named in the title. The first section\nis dedicated to the need to clarify the controversial term\nGlaube (which extends from Jacobi, 1994(2): 254 and JWA 2, 1:\n8 up to Jacobi, 1994(2): 279 and JWA 2, 1: 40). An intermission\nbetween the first and the second sections introduces an interesting\naccount of Jacobi\u2019s own philosophical education (up to Jacobi,\n1994(2): 287 and JWA 2, 1: 49). The second section (up to Jacobi,\n1994(2): 306 and JWA 2, 1: 71) criticizes the principle of the ground\n(Der Satz des Grundes) (Jacobi, 1994(2): 288 and JWA 2, 1:\n50) in contraposition to the principle of reason (das Principium\nder Vernunft), which is intended as part of the principle of life\n(das Principium des Lebens) (Jacobi, 1994(2): 301\u2013302\nand JWA 2, 1: 65) and ushers in the topic that dominates the third and\nfinal section: the living being. Hence, the third section revolves\naround the rationality of life, providing an analysis of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy.\n\nThe theory of knowledge that the notion of Glaube inaugurates\nrelies on the immediate experience that the subject reports. As Jacobi\nclaims in the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019: \u2018[f]aith is the\nelement of all human cognition and activity\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2):\n234 and JWA 1, 1: 125). This thesis follows after another paradigmatic\none, which integrates the former and states that \u2018[w]e can only\ndemonstrate similarities. Every proof presupposes something already\nproven, the principle of which is Revelation\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2):\n234 and JWA 1, 1: 125). To the unexperienced reader, approaching\nJacobi\u2019s texts for the first time, the theological character of\nthese two assertions may look unequivocal, but that reader would be\nmistaken. In general, in Jacobi\u2019s view, the notion of\nGlaube, reminiscent of Hume\u2019s concept of belief (also\ntranslated as \u2018Glaube\u2019) (di Giovanni, 1994: 90), must\nconflict with the rationalistic foundation of knowledge endorsed by\nsystematic (or modern) philosophy. Nevertheless, Jacobi\u2019s\ninterpretation of the foundation of knowledge remains rational. We can\nprofit from a few lines in the \u2018Prefatory Note\u2019 to the\n\u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 to shed light on the use of the term\n\u2018Glaube\u2019 in Jacobi\u2019s vocabulary: \u2018as a realist\nI am forced to say that all knowledge derives exclusively from faith,\nfor things must be given to me before I am in a position to enquire\nabout relations\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994(2): 256 and JWA 2, 1: 10). This\nthesis, so straightforward, is the pivot upon which Jacobi\u2019s\nrealism will be built.\n\nThe first part of this claim entails the thesis that was already put\nforth in the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019, but the second,\nexplanatory part prompts the reader to recognize the real scope of\n\u2018Glaube\u2019: faith is not knowledge, as it does not include\nor address relations; rather, it concerns the distinct cognition of\nwhat is at the basis of all knowledge and relations. It is different\nfrom any other epistemological faculty and from sensibility and\nperception as well (Sandkaulen, 2019: 33\u201354) because it forms a\nsubjective response to what lies beyond any thinking process or\ntheoretical modeling. It refers instead to the apprehension\n(Vernehmen) that is necessarily at the beginning of the\ndefinition of reality. Faith, in general, is not even assent because\nits content cannot be doubted, as the price for doubting its content\nis idealism. One excerpt from the dialogue addresses precisely this\npoint: \u2018Hume himself grants in the same essay [\u2018Essay on\nHuman Understanding\u2019] that we only derive the representation of\npower from the feeling of our own power, and specifically, from the\nfeeling of its use in overcoming an obstacle. He concedes, therefore,\nthat we have the feeling of a power, and that we perceive the results\nof its application. But he does not take this to be a complete\nexperience of cause and effect, since we have no sensation of HOW the\npower brings about this result. His doubts are after the manner of the\nidealists, and are closely connected with these. In the same manner I\ncan of course doubt that it is I who (in virtue of what appears to me\nto be a power in me) stretch out my hand, move my foot, follow the\nthread of our present dialogue and control it from my side, since I\nhave no possible insight either into the nature of what I take to be\nthe cause of what happens, or into its connection with the result. I\ncan doubt this just as much as I can doubt that I perceive anything\noutside me. If it\u2019s in you to be disturbed by such doubts, then\nthere is nothing that I can say to you. But I think that your faith\ntriumphs over them just as easily as mine\u2019 (Jacobi, 1994 (2):\n292 and JWA 2, 1: 55\u201356).\n\nDue to their common background in modern epistemology, the ideas\nconveyed in this passage can easily find a place within contemporary\ndebates about the philosophy of mind, epistemology, and\n metaphysics.[2]\n However, contemporary readers may find Jacobi\u2019s response\nunhelpful precisely because Jacobi does not explicitly respond to\nidealists\u2019 doubts, although he repeatedly shows, from the\n\u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 to the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019\nand from the \u2018Jacobi an Fichte\u2019 to the \u2018Von den\ng\u00fcttlichen Dingen\u2019, how idealism is destined to annihilate\nthe very basis for all knowledge, thus falling into an empty teaching\n(Jacobi, 1994 (2): 291 and JWA 2, 1: 56\u201357). A critical reply to\nwhat Jacobi calls idealism (that is, a consistent system of\nexplanations that proves self\u2013sufficient) would require the\nassumption that problems with idealism arise from a faulty explanation\nor inference. It would, therefore, assume idealism\u2019s principal\nthesis, i.e., that discursive thinking can be self\u2013sufficient\nand can accommodate a foundation of its own knowledge. Instead, Jacobi\nformulates a sophisticated refutation of what he calls idealism, which\ntakes the concept of the cause (in the shape of the existence of a\nfree agent) as its center of gravity. He then progresses toward his\nthesis that knowledge has its foundation outside of itself. Within\nthis new framework, Jacobi contends that the connection between the\nsystem of knowledge and the foundation of knowledge necessarily falls\noutside of thinking process. Here, Jacobi announces his motto:\n\u2018Ich erfahre, da\u00df ich bin, und da\u00df etwas au\u00dfer\nmir ist, in demselben untheilbaren Augenblick\u2019 (\u2018I\nexperience that I am, and that there is something outside me, in one\nand the same indivisible moment\u2019) (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 277 and JWA\n2, 1: 37). The self\u2013consciousness of the I and its consciousness\nare interdependent; however, they are not to be analyzed in the manner\nof Fichte, to name a philosopher that, against all appearance, was\nvery close to Jacobi, both personally and intellectually (Ivaldo,\n1996). Their interdependence is not granted in consideration of a\nsubtle and advanced dissection of the dialectic that proves their\nshape and fundamental merging. Instead, Jacobi guides our attention to\nthe \u2018bin\u2019 and the \u2018ist\u2019 that the\n\u2018erfahre\u2019 necessitates. Experience, no matter its shape or\nform, conceptually necessitates the existence of two sides, the\nI and the Thou (as Jacobi calls any given that is\nopposite to the I). Jacobi claims that existence forms a given before\nand beyond any reasoning because it is the basis upon which all\nreasoning can genuinely begin. In other terms, existence falls outside\nof reasoning. Hence, it is important to assume that the human being\ncan have direct contact, not mediated by arguments or thinking\nprocess, with what lies at the basis of all knowledge. This connection\nis immediate, not irrational; in fact, the human being is rational,\nprecisely because he exhibits the ability to connect with what lies\nbefore and beyond reasoning (JWA 3: 10\u201311).\n\nThe notion of \u2018Glaube\u2019 introduces us to the specificity of\nJacobi\u2019s epistemology through its implication of how an\nimmediate apprehension of existence does not keep us from describing\nexistence rationally. Still, rationality is not entirely overt, so\nlong as we do not assume its practical profile: that is, only free\nactions exhibit the original way in which the I meets the Thou. In\ndifferent terms, it is only as a free agent that the I finds both\nitself and the world around itself. This move makes the practical\nhorizon the only perimeter in which the ultimate foundation of what\ngives content to our knowledge can actually be defined; existence, in\nother terms, is a practical quality (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 194 and JWA 1,\n1: 28).\n\nAs this picture takes on clearer contours, the magnitude of the role\nthat the notion of cause plays in Jacobi\u2019s philosophy can be\nrealized (Sandkaulen 2000: 171ff). The difference that this thesis\nmakes can be appreciated through an examination that the connection\nbetween cause and effect (Ursache\u2013Wirkung)\nhappens in time, while the connection between ground and consequence\n(Grund\u2013Folge) does not take account of time\n(Sandkaulen, 2000: 133\u2013170). As seen in Spinoza\u2019s system,\nthe principle of the ground presents a realty that is frozen in\neternity, while the determination of an item is not temporally given.\nFor Jacobi, instead, existence changes in time or, better said,\nexistence is precisely the what that a free agent defines in its time.\nThis distinction then allows a series of additional important\nadvancements in respect to Jacobi\u2019s realism, as the introduction\nof the passing of time (in the form of irreversibility) into our\npicture of reality makes things more difficult for a mechanistic\npicture of reality (e.g., Prigogine, 1988: chapters 2 and 3).\nObviously, this is not to claim that a classical Newtonian dynamic\npicture of reality does not consider time; it is only to show that the\nsame picture presents the problem of the reversibility of states,\nwhile Jacobi\u2019s realism establishes that no distinct state of\nreality is reversible. On the one hand, determinism presents a series\nof interlaced determinations that complete a picture that is fixed in\neternity (sub specie aeternitatis). In contrast,\nJacobi\u2019s realism portrays a reality that takes the passing of\ntime as a foundational aspect. Ultimately, Jacobi\u2019s realism\nprohibits the reversibility of states.\n",
