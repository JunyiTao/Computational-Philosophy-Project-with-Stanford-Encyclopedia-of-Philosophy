    "main_text": "Hermeneutical Foundations || Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n2.3 Aesthetics and Subjectivism\n\nIn 1936 Heidegger gave three lectures on \u2018The Origin of the Work\nof Art\u2019. In these lectures, not published until 1950 (but which\nGadamer heard at the time of their original presentation, see Gadamer\n1997b, 47), Heidegger connects art with truth, arguing that the\nessence of the artwork is not its \u2018representational\u2019\ncharacter, but rather its capacity to allow the disclosure of a world.\nThus the Greek temple establishes the \u2018Greek\u2019 world and in\nso doing allows things to take on a particular appearance within that\nworld. Heidegger refers to this event of disclosure as the event of\n\u2018truth\u2019. The sense of truth at issue here is one that\nHeidegger presents in explicit contrast to what he views as the\ntraditional concept of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019. Such\ncorrectness is usually taken to consist in some form of correspondence\nbetween individual statements and the world, but so-called\n\u2018coherence\u2019 accounts of truth, according to which truth is\na matter of the consistency of a statement with a larger body of\nstatements, can also be viewed as based upon the same underlying\nnotion of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019. While Heidegger does not\nabandon the notion of truth as \u2018correctness\u2019, he argues\nthat it is derivative of a more basic sense of truth as what he terms\n\u2018unconcealment\u2019. Understood in this latter sense, truth is\nnot a property of statements as they stand in relation to the world,\nbut rather an event or process in and through which both the things of\nthe world and what is said about them come to be revealed at one and\nthe same time\u2014the possibility of \u2018correctness\u2019\narises on the basis of just such \u2018unconcealment\u2019.\n\nIt is important to recognize, however, that the unconcealment at issue\nis not a matter of the bringing about of some form of complete and\nabsolute transparency. The revealing of things is, in fact, always\ndependent upon other things being simultaneously concealed (in much\nthe same way as seeing something in one way depends on not seeing it\nin another). Truth is thus understood as the unconcealment that allows\nthings to appear, and that also makes possible the truth and falsity\nof individual statements, and yet which arises on the basis of the\nongoing play between unconcealment and concealment\u2014a\nplay that, for the most part, remains itself hidden and is never\ncapable of complete elucidation. In the language Heidegger employs in\n\u2018The Origin of the Work of Art\u2019, the unconcealment of\n\u2018world\u2019 is thereby grounded in the concealment of\n\u2018earth\u2019. It is this sense of truth as the emergence of\nthings into unconcealment that occurs on the basis of the play between\nconcealing and unconcealing that is taken by Heidegger as the essence\n(or \u2018origin\u2019) of the work of art. This idea of truth, as\nwell as the poetic language Heidegger employed in his exposition, had\na decisive effect on Gadamer\u2019s own thinking. Indeed, Gadamer\ndescribed his philosophical hermeneutics as precisely an attempt\n\u201cto take up and elaborate this line of thinking from the later\nHeidegger\u201d (Gadamer 1997b, 47)\n\nThere are two crucial elements to Gadamer\u2019s appropriation of\nHeidegger here: first, the focus on art, and the connection of art\nwith truth; second, the focus on truth itself as the event of prior\nand partial disclosure (or more properly, of\nconcealment/unconcealment) in which we are already involved and that\ncan never be made completely transparent. Both of these elements are\nconnected with Gadamer\u2019s response to the subjectivist and\nidealist elements in German thought that were present in the\nneo-Kantian tradition, and, more specifically, in romantic\nhermeneutics and aesthetic theory. As Gadamer saw it, aesthetic theory\nhad, largely under the influence of Kant, become alienated from the\nactual experience of art\u2014the response to art had become\nabstracted and \u2018aestheticised\u2019\u2014while aesthetic\njudgment had become purely a matter of taste, and so of subjective\nresponse. Similarly, under the influence of the\n\u2018scientific\u2019 historiography of those such as Ranke,\ntogether with the romantic hermeneutics associated with Schleiermacher\nand others, the desire for objectivity had led to the separation of\nhistorical understanding from the contemporary situation that\nmotivates it, and to a conception of historical method as based in the\nreconstruction of the subjective experiences of the author\u2014a\nreconstruction that, as Hegel made clear, is surely impossible (see\nGadamer 1989b, 164\u20139).\n\nBy turning back to the direct experience of art, and to the concept of\ntruth as prior and partial disclosure, Gadamer was able to develop an\nalternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas of\ndialogue and practical wisdom taken from Plato and Aristotle, and of\nhermeneutical situatedness taken from the early Heidegger. Just as the\nartwork is taken as central and determining in the experience of art,\nso is understanding similarly determined by the matter to be\nunderstood; as the experience of art reveals, not in spite of, but\nprecisely because of the way it also conceals, so understanding is\npossible, not in spite of, but precisely because of its prior\ninvolvement. In Gadamer\u2019s developed work, the concept of\n\u2018play\u2019 (Spiel) has an important role here.\nGadamer takes play as the basic clue to the ontological structure of\nart, emphasizing the way in which play is not a form of disengaged,\ndisinterested exercise of subjectivity, but is rather something that\nhas its own order and structure to which one is given over. The\nstructure of play has obvious affinities with all of the other\nconcepts at issue here\u2014of dialogue, phronesis, the\nhermeneutical situation, the truth of art. Indeed, one can take all of\nthese ideas as providing slightly different elaborations of what is\nessentially the same basic conception of understanding\u2014one that\ntakes our finitude, that is, our prior involvement and partiality, not\nas a barrier to understanding, but rather as its enabling condition.\nIt is this conception that is worked out in detail in Truth and\nMethod.\n",
