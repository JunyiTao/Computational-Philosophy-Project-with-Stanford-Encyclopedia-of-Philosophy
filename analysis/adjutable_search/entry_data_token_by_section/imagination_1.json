    "main_text": "The Nature of Imagination || Varieties of Imagination\n1.1 Varieties of Imagination\n\nThere is a general consensus among those who work on the topic that\nthe term \u201cimagination\u201d is used too broadly to\npermit simple taxonomy. Indeed, it is common for overviews to begin\nwith an invocation of P.F. Strawson\u2019s remarks in\n\u201cImagination and Perception\u201d, where he writes:\n\n\nThe uses, and applications, of the terms \u201cimage\u201d,\n\u201cimagine\u201d, \u201cimagination\u201d, and so forth make up\na very diverse and scattered family. Even this image of a family seems\ntoo definite. It would be a matter of more than difficulty to identify\nand list the family\u2019s members, let alone their relations of\nparenthood and cousinhood. (Strawson 1970: 31)\n\n\nThese taxonomic challenges carry over into attempts at\ncharacterization. In the opening chapter of Mimesis as\nMake-Believe\u2014perhaps the most influential contemporary\nmonograph on imagination\u2014Kendall Walton throws up his hands at\nthe prospect of delineating the notion precisely. After enumerating\nand distinguishing a number of paradigmatic instances of imagining, he\nasks:\n\n\nWhat is it to imagine? We have examined a number of dimensions along\nwhich imaginings can vary; shouldn\u2019t we now spell out what they\nhave in common?\u2014Yes, if we can. But I can\u2019t. (Walton 1990:\n19)\n\n\nLeslie Stevenson (2003: 238) makes arguably the only recent attempt at\na somewhat comprehensive inventory of the term\u2019s uses, covering\ntwelve of \u201cthe most influential conceptions of\nimagination\u201d that can be found in recent discussions in\n\u201cphilosophy of mind, aesthetics, ethics, poetry and \u2026\nreligion\u201d.\n",
