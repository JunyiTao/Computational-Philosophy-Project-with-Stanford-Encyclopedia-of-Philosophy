    "main_text": "Law || Law is an appeal to reason\n7.1 Law is an appeal to reason\n\nAquinas\u2019 well-known discussion of law in ST I-II qq.\n90\u201397 (a discussion which actually extends through the less\nstudied qq. 98\u2013105) has been justly admired by jurists and other\nthinkers not otherwise much interested in his work. But it is shaped\nby his concern there (i) to present for beginner students of theology\nan overview of the universe and of the vast sweep of creatures out\nfrom their divine creator and back to the same transcendent being as\ntheir ultimate destiny, and (ii) to synthesize the traditional\nvocabulary and classic theological sources on law. So prominence is\nthere given to the \u201ceternal law\u201d by which God governs even\ninanimate creatures (as by the laws of physics, etc.), and to the\n\u201cparticipation\u201d of natural moral law in that eternal law.\nBut when he is free from these textbookish constraints he emphasizes\nthat law\u2019s most essential feature is something which is not true\nof the laws of nature (physics, biology, etc.), namely that it is an\nappeal to the mind, choice, moral strength (virtus) and love\nof those subject to the law: ScG III cc. 114\u2013117; this\nis quietly indicated also in ST I-II q. 91 a. 2 ad 3.\n\nLaw (in its central case and focal meaning) is thus always a plan for\nco-ordination through free cooperation. The structure of things being\nwhat it is, the principles of practical reason and morality (natural\nmoral law and natural right) can be understood, accepted, and lived\nby, as fully directive in conscience, without needing to be regarded\nas (what they really are) an appeal from mind to mind, a\nplan \u2013 freely made to be freely adopted \u2013 for\nintegral human fulfillment. As the divine creator was in no way\nconstrained to choose to create this universe as distinct from any\nother good possible universe, so human legislators have wide moral\nfreedom to choose amongst alternative possible legal arrangements,\nmaking one set of provisions legally and (presumptively) morally\nobligatory by the sheer fact of adopting it \u2013 that is, by what\nAquinas calls the law-makers\u2019 determinatio: I-II q. 95\na. 2; q. 99 a. 3 ad 2; q. 104 a. 1..\n",
