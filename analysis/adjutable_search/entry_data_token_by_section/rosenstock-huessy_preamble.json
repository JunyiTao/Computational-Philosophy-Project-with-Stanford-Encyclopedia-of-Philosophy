    "main_text": "\n\nEugen Rosenstock-Huessy (1888\u20131973) was a sociologist and social\nphilosopher who, along with his close friend Franz Rosenzweig, and\nFerdinand Ebner and Martin Buber, was a major exponent of speech\nthinking or dialogicism. The central insight of speech thinking is\nthat speech or language is not merely, or even primarily, a\ndescriptive act, but a responsive and creative act which is the basis\nof our social\n existence.[1]\n The greater part of Rosenstock-Huessy\u2019s work was devoted to\ndemonstrating how speech/language, through its unpredictable\nfecundity, expands our powers and, through its inescapably historical\nforming character, also binds them. According to Rosenstock-Huessy,\nspeech makes us collective masters of time and gives us the ability to\novercome historical death by founding new, more expansive and\nfulfilling spaces of social-life.\n\nRosenstock-Huessy also belonged to that post-Nietzschean revival of\nreligious thought which included Franz Rosenzweig, Karl Barth, Leo\nWeismantel, Hans and Rudolf Ehrenberg, Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker,\nMartin Buber, Lev Shestov, Hugo Bergmann, Florens Christian Range,\nNikolai Berdyaev, Margaret Susman, Werner Picht (all of whom were\ninvolved in the Patmos publishing house and its offshoot Die\nKreatur) and Paul Tillich. Common to this group was the belief\nthat religious speech, which they saw as distinctly not metaphysical,\ndisclosed layers of experience and creativity (personal and\nsocio-historical) which remain inaccessible to the metaphysics of\nnaturalism.\n",
