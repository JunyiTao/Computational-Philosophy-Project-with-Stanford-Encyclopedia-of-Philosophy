    "main_text": "Beyond the Black/White Binary, Beyond Double Consciousness || Kaleidoscopic Consciousness\n6. Conclusion\n\nAny account of double consciousness rooted in the sweep of Du\nBois\u2019s writings must acknowledge his taking it as both a state\nof consciousness of individual African-Americans as members of an\noppressed group and also as a form of social recognition of the status\nof that group in the wider culture. Such an account must also confront\nthe glaringly peculiar fact of the singular use of the term by Du Bois\ndespite his revisiting in his writing, on various occasions in\ndifferent contexts of publication, what seems to be an increasingly\nexpansive repertoire of similar or closely related phenomena.\n\nDu Bois gave up the moniker \u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d,\narguably, for a variety of reasons, but in part to resist the\nimpression that this is simply and only a problem of\nconsciousness, a problem only of and for black folk,\nunconnected with any palpable social facts. Also, as we have seen, the\nclose association of some of the original senses of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d with pathological psychic states,\nmay have given Du Bois pause after his initial use of the term. He\nalso increasingly wanted to distance himself from the idea \u2013\nexplicitly rejected in Dusk of Dawn \u2013 that\ncollectivities are entities with their own consciousnesses, reified in\nwhat he came to regard as mistaken idealist overreach. Finally, Du\nBois seems to have opened up and expanded the range of phenomena\nrelated to double consciousness beyond the exemplar in the 1903\ntexts.\n\nBut Du Bois did not characterize the matter succinctly in one place so\nas to embrace both all its effects on consciousness and affect\nand the correlative reality of an \u2018environing\u2019\ncondition. Rather, he employs, alternately, two strategies of writing\nto capture its fullness. He presents first- and third-personal\naccounts of \u201cwhat it is like\u201d, \u201cspiritually\u201d,\nto live subject to double consciousness, through autobiographical\nwriting or by personifying the feelings, attitudes, and thoughts\nassociated with double consciousness in fictional or composite\ncharacters. And he describes social environments along with the\n\u201ccustoms\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d,\n\u201csubconscious\u201d attitudes and modes of being typical of\nsocial groups living in those environments.\n\nNear the end of his life, in the posthumously published\nAutobiography, Du Bois revisited his original formulation of\n\u201ctwo-ness\u201d:\n\nI began to feel that dichotomy which all my life has characterized my\nthought: how far can love for my oppressed race accord with love for\nthe oppressing country? And when these loyalties diverge, where shall\nmy soul find refuge? (1968: 169)\n\n\nThis passage relates the feelings triggered in young Du Bois while\nobserving \u201cthe pageantry and patriotism of Germany in\n1892\u201d. This plainly autobiographical formulation in no way\nsuggests anything like a basic psychic split; it reflects an\nambivalence, a conflict of affections and loyalties within an integral\nself.\n\nAll previous critical attention has been fixed steadily on the\nspiritual aspect of the phenomena of double consciousness, virtually\nnone on the environing conditions Du Bois saw as giving rise to it.\nThose environing conditions might be summed up thus:\n\na social and political regime grounded in oppression and the\nmaintenance of vastly unequal and segregated living conditions of\nsocial groups ideologically and culturally identified as racially\ndistinct and unequal, creating a \u201cdouble environment\u201d\ninimical to members of the subordinate racial group.\n\n\nThe spiritual correlate of these environing conditions would\ninclude some combination of at least some of these sorts of emergent\naspects:\n\nharboring a view of oneself premised on false, demeaning, or\nderogatory estimations of one\u2019s capabilities, preferences,\naptitudes and desires \u2013 estimations made primarily or\nexclusively due to one\u2019s racial identity \u2013 and a\nconsequent determination of a life course and practical orientation to\none\u2019s goals and to others based upon those estimations;\na tendency to confuse two distinct sets of attitudes, feelings,\nand beliefs about oneself and one\u2019s disfavored racial group, to\nbeing \u201call mixed up\u201d and/or in a state of\ndouble-mindedness, ambivalence, inner turmoil or indecision in\nrelation to conflicting or opposed views and feelings about oneself\nand/or one\u2019s social situation;\nan awareness of oneself as characterized by others in an\nunfavorable or demeaning way in keeping with disparaging descriptors\nassociated with one\u2019s racial identity;\na reflective confrontation with a stable social situation\ncharacterized by consistent disparities in the life-prospects,\nachievements, social station, power, wealth, and cultural recognition\ntypically available to members of one\u2019s race relative to a\ndominant race;\na consciousness of and feelings related to a tension associated\nwith being taken for, or acting as, a member or representative of a\ndevalued race to members of the dominant race, in either a cultural,\nsocial, or a political capacity;\na practical attitude or orientation, for strategic purposes\nrelated to the pursuit of socially recognized goods or personal goals,\ninvolving the ascription to others of beliefs, intentions,\nexpectations or reactions to one\u2019s acts or words predicated on a\nfalsely degrading, fearful, or dismissive judgment of who or what one\nis, on the basis of one\u2019s race, and revision or adjustment of\none\u2019s plans on the basis of such ascriptions;\na pervasive sense of uncertainty regarding the reception of\noneself, one\u2019s activities and projects by others, under the\nweight of inappropriate, prejudicial, false and/or demeaning\ngeneralizations based on one\u2019s race;\nthe experience of a feeling or feelings of despair, rage, anger,\nfrustration, distress, or some combination of these, arising from and\nin keeping with recognition or awareness of any of the sorts of\nexperiences listed above.\n\n\nThis list, while including the sense of\n\u201cdouble-consciousness\u201d as Du Bois develops the idea in\nSouls (particularly the first three items), also expands the\nsense of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d to include more active,\npractical, and critical appropriations of the situation established by\nthe color line. Finally, and in this practical spirit, Medina has put\n\u2018kaleidoscopic consciousness\u2019 forward as an activist,\nresistant form of epistemic sensitivity to the socially corrosive\neffects of the multiplicitous oppressive structures in modern\nsocieties.\n",
