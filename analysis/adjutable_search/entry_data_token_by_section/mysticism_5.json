    "main_text": "Classifying Mystical Experiences || Apophatic and Kataphatic Mysticism\n2.4 Apophatic and Kataphatic Mysticism\n\nApophatic mysticism (from the\nGreek \u201capophasis,\u201d meaning negation or\n\u201csaying away\u201d) is contrasted with kataphatic mysticism (from the\nGreek \u201ckataphasis,\u201d meaning affirmation or\n\u201csaying with\u201d). Apophatic mystics claim that nothing positive can\nbe said about objects or states of affairs that they experience. These\nare absolutely indescribable, or \u201cineffable.\u201d Thus,\napophatic theology typically will be negative theology \u2014 that we\ncan say only what God is not. Kataphatic mysticism does make claims\nabout what a mystic experiences. Pertaining to God, this means\nthat God can be described by positive terms. Analytic philosophers of\nmysticism have mainly dealt with kataphatic conceptions. (For an\nexception see Alston 2005 in the Other Internet Resources.)\n\nShankara\u2019s Advaita Vedanta is apophatic: nothing describing phenomenal\nfeatures can be applied to Brahman. Even discussing Brahman without\nqualities (nirguna-brahman) is still a form of the formless\nBrahman (Brahma-sutra-bhasya III.2.14). So too, Plotinus\nstated that no name applies to the One (Enneads IV.9.5).\nIn a remark echoed by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas about God, he\nwrote that we can only state what the One is not, not what it is\n(Enneads V.3.14). \n\nThe two approaches can represent two stages in mystical contemplation\nwith the apophatic approach usually treated as higher. Theologians\nalso may utilize the apophatic approach (and ineffability) in contexts\nunrelated to mystical experiences. Even the theologian who introduced\nthe via negativa to Christianity, Pseudo-Dionysius the\nAreopagite (c. 500), also wrote works in the affirmative\nkataphatic approach on religious symbolism and the names of God,\nwhile still stressing that God cannot be fully captured by any\nname. \n",
