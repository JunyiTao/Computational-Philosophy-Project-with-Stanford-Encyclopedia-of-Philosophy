    "main_text": "Immune Ecology and Evolution || Ecological approaches to immunity\n3.1 Ecological approaches to immunity\n\nThe ideas underpinning somatic ecology originate in the early view of\nsomatic cells behaving as social organisms forming stable associations\n(Reynolds 2018: 12\u201358). Assuming that such interactions serve\nthe welfare of the organism, Virchow and other authors described a\n\u201ccell state\u201d (or a \u201ccell republic)\u201d, a\nmetaphoric expression of what became a sociological model of cellular\ncommunication (Virchow 1858 [1863]; R. Wagner 1999; Reynolds 2018:\n86\u2013113). And pathologically, such a consortium becomes a\n\u201ccivil war\u201d of competing cell lines. The model then led to\na general Darwinian formulation of an internal struggle for\nexistence throughout the life of an individual (Roux 1881; Metchnikoff\n1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991; see Buss 1987; Queller and Strassmann 2009;\nGodfrey-Smith 2009 for the contemporary standing of this proposal of\nevolutionary change). Metchnikoff, a key advocate of this theory,\nassumed that cells operate on Darwinian principles similar to those\ngoverning the adaptation of organisms in changing environmental\nconditions. He thus introduced a common framework in which to\nunderstand dynamic biological communities\u2014whether internal cell\nlines or organisms adjusting to their environment. This ecological\norientation altered basic conceptions of immunity and identity by\ndisplacing static notions of individuality with dialectical constructs\n(Levins and Lewontin 1985; Tauber 2008).\n\nThis ecological viewpoint serves to depict somatic and microbial cell\npopulations as systems of communication and information exchange. With\nthe change in focus from individuals to ecosystems, the classical\ndichotomies governing immunology\u2019s theory, i.e.,\ntolerance/responsiveness, immune/non-immune, self/nonself, has been\nrevised. How these oppositions collapse in an information-based\necological format is illustrated by the phenomenon of inter-kingdom\nsignaling, a form of communication that not only bridges an\nevolutionary gap between microbes and host, but also helps to overcome\nputative boundaries between immune, epithelial, and neural systems\n(cf. Hughes and Sperandio 2008). When considered from the\nenvironmental perspective, the transition site between the genetic\nbody and its resident microbes is no longer a frontline of defense but\nrather an ecological ecotone, an interactive zone at which cellular\ncommunities engage in a dialogue to explore new adaptive opportunities\n(Tauber 2008). The importance of such interfaces is well illustrated\nby mutual scaffolding and niche construction strategies that are\nutilized by microbial symbionts and their hosts to direct development\nof larger ecological units (i.e., holobionts) (Chiu and S. Gilbert\n2015).\n\nStruggle and cooperation in the immune context were assumed since Koch\nto depend on intrinsic characteristics of invading microbes that, due\nto their virulence factors and other gene-encoded characteristics, act\nas pathogens, commensals or mutualists (M\u00e9thot and Alizon\n2014). By accounting for a larger context of the immune encounter, the\necological position challenges this vision by offering a view in which\n\u201cthere are no pathogens, no commensals, and no opportunists;\ninstead there are only microbes and hosts that interact\u201d\nunpredictably (Casadevall and Pirofski 2015). In this scenario,\nmicrobial virulence becomes an emergent property, dependent on host\nand microbial factors, whose interactions cannot be derived from first\nprinciples (Casadevall, Fang, and Pirofski 2011).\n\nIn sum, the ecological view has led to the view that boundaries\nbetween parasitism, commensalism and mutualism are changeable and\nfluid, dependent on host factors, the full microbiota, and the broader\nenvironmental context (temperature, nutrients, etc.) (M\u00e9thot\nand Alizon 2014). Current views of plasticity, pathogenicity, and\nvirulence revitalizes the nineteenth-century concept of microbial-host\nequilibrium (M\u00e9thot 2012). In the context of disease ecology,\nlong-lasting associations between hosts and parasites leads to a\nclimax state in which the respective populations remain stable (Burnet\nand White 1972; Anderson 2004). The immune equilibrium model then\ndepicts persistent viral colonization as a product of a \u201cdynamic\nbut metastable equilibrium between the virome and the host\u201d\n(Virgin, Wherry, and Ahmed 2009; Eberl 2010). Thus, the modern idea of\nbalance highlights a stable state in which offensive and\ndefensive forces neutralize one another to form stable associations\nbetween parasites and the host with little damage to either partner\n(Swiatczak 2014).\n",
