    "main_text": "The \u2018Ages of the World\u2019\n5. Positive and Negative Philosophy, and the Critique of Hegel\n\nSchelling has often been understood as providing the transitional\n\u2018objective idealist\u2019 link between Fichte and Hegel. By\nregarding Hegel\u2019s system as the culmination of German Idealism\nthis interpretation fails to do justice to Schelling\u2019s real\nphilosophical ambitions. Many of these insights, particularly in the\nlater philosophy (1827\u20131854), directly and indirectly influenced\nthe ideas of thinkers, like Feuerbach, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche,\nHeidegger, and Adorno, who were critical of Hegel\u2019s claim to\narticulate a complete philosophical system.\n\nThe differences between Hegel and Schelling derive from their\nrespective approaches to understanding the absolute. For Hegel the\nabsolute is the result of the self-cancellation of everything\nfinite, whose mode of being is precisely to change into something\ndifferent. Philosophy can therefore articulate the nature of the\nabsolute by an account of how finite determinations are always\ntranscended. This takes the form of the \u2018negation of the\nnegation\u2019, in a system whose end comprehends its beginning. For\nHegel the result becomes known when the beginning negates itself as\nbeing \u2018in itself\u2019 to becomes being \u2018for\nitself\u2019 at the end of the system, thus in a process in which it\nreflects itself to itself by becoming other to itself. Schelling\nalready becomes publicly critical of Hegel while working on a later\nversion of the WA philosophy in Erlangen in the 1820s, but makes his\ncriticisms fully public in lectures given in Munich in the 1830s, and\nin the 1840s and 1850s as professor in Berlin. The aim of the Idealist\nsystems was for thought to reflect what it is not \u2014 being\n\u2014 as really itself, even as it appears not to be itself, thereby\navoiding Kant\u2019s dualism. The issue between Schelling and Hegel\nis whether the grounding of reason by itself is not in fact a sort of\nphilosophical narcissism, in which reason admires its reflection in\nbeing without being able fully to articulate its relationship to that\nreflection. Like Hegel, Schelling argues that it is not the particular\nmanifestation of knowledge which tells me the truth about the world,\nbut rather the necessity of moving from one piece of knowledge to the\nnext. However, a logical reconstruction of the process of knowledge\ncan, for Schelling, only be a reflection of thought by itself. The\nreal process cannot be described in philosophy, because the cognitive\nground of knowledge and the real ground, although they are inseparable\nfrom each other, cannot be shown to reflect each other.\n\nDieter Henrich characterises Hegel\u2019s conception of the absolute\nas follows: \u201cThe absolute is the finite to the extent to which\nthe finite is nothing at all but negative relation to itself\u201d\n(Henrich 1982, p. 82). Hegel\u2019s system depends upon showing how\neach particular way of conceiving of the world has an internal\ncontradiction. This necessarily leads thought to more comprehensive\nways of grasping the world, until the point where there can be no more\ncomprehensive way because there is no longer any contradiction to give\nrise to it. The very fact of the finite limitations of empirical\nthought therefore becomes what gives rise to the infinite, which, in\nHegel\u2019s terms, is thought that is bounded by itself and by\nnothing else.\n\nSchelling accepts such a conception, to which he substantially\ncontributed in his early philosophy, as the way to construct a\n\u2018negative\u2019 system of philosophy, because it explains the\nlogic of change, once there is a world to be explained. The conception\ndoes not, though, explain why there is a developing world at all, but\nmerely reconstructs in thought the necessary structure of development\non the basis of necessities in thought. Schelling\u2019s own attempt\nat explaining the world\u2019s ontological and historical facticity\nwill lead him to a \u2018philosophical theology\u2019 which traces\nthe development of mythology and then of Christian revelation in his\nPhilosophy of Mythology and Philosophy of\nRevelation, which, like all his substantial works after 1811, are\nnot published in his lifetime. The failure of his philosophical\ntheology does not, though, necessarily invalidate his philosophical\narguments against Hegel. His alternative to the \u201ccommon mistake\nof every philosophy that has existed up to now\u201d \u2014 the\n\u201cmerely logical relationship of God to the world\u201d\n(System der Weltalter, p. 57) \u2014 Schelling terms\n\u2018positive philosophy\u2019. The \u2018merely logical\nrelationship\u2019 entails a reflexivity, in which the world\nnecessarily follows from the nature of God, and God and the world are\ntherefore the \u2018other of themselves\u2019. Hegel\u2019s system\ntries to obviate the facticity of the world by understanding reason as\nthe world\u2019s immanent self-articulation. Schelling, in contrast,\ninsists that human reason cannot explain its own existence,\nand therefore cannot encompass itself and its other within a system of\nphilosophy. We cannot, he maintains, make sense of the manifest world\nby beginning with reason, but must instead begin with the contingency\nof being and try to make sense of it with the reason which is only one\naspect of it and which cannot be explained in terms of its being a\nrepresentation of the true nature of being.\n\nSchelling contends that the identity of thought and being cannot be\narticulated within thought, because thought must\npresuppose that they are identical in a way which thought, as\none side of a relation, cannot comprehend. By redefining the\n\u2018concept\u2019 in such a way that it is always already both\nsubject and object, Hegel aims to avoid any presuppositions on either\nthe subject or the object side, allowing the system to complete itself\nas the \u2018self-determination of the concept\u2019. Schelling\npresents the basic alternative as follows:\n\nFor either the concept would have to go first, and being would have to\nbe the consequence of the concept, which would mean it was no longer\nabsolute being; or the concept is the consequence of being, then we\nmust begin with being without the concept. (SW II/3, p. 164)\n\n\nHegel attempts to merge concept and being by making being part of a\nstructure of self-reflection, rather than the basis of the\ninterrelation between subject and object. In Schelling\u2019s terms,\nHegel therefore invalidly assumes that \u2018essence\u2019, what we\nknow of things, which is one side of the relationship between being\nand essence, can articulate its identity with the other side in the\n\u2018concept\u2019, because the other side is revealed as being\n\u2018nothing\u2019 until it has entered into a relationship which\nmakes it determinate as a knowable moment of the whole process. For\nHegel, on the other hand, Schelling has to invoke being as something\nimmediate: this means it must be wholly opaque, and so is equivalent\nto nothing.\n\nThe problem which Hegel does not overcome is that the identity of\nessence and being cannot be known, because, as Schelling\nclaims of his concept of being, \u201cexisting is not here the\nconsequence of the concept or of essence, but rather existence is here\nitself the concept and itself the essence\u201d (SW II/3, p. 167).\nThe problem of reflection cannot be overcome in Hegel\u2019s manner:\nidentifying one\u2019s reflection in a mirror as oneself (understood\nnow as a metaphor for essence) entails, as we saw above, a prior\nnon-reflexive moment if one is to know that the reflection is\noneself, rather than a random reflected object. How far Schelling\nmoves from any reflexive version of identity philosophy is evident in\nthe following from the Introduction to the Philosophy of\nRevelation or Foundation of the Positive Philosophy of\n1842\u20133:\n\nour self-consciousness is not at all the consciousness of that nature\nwhich has passed through everything, it is precisely just our\nconsciousness (\u2026) for the consciousness of man is not = the\nconsciousness of nature (\u2026) Far from man and his activity\nmaking the world comprehensible, man himself is that which is most\nincomprehensible. (SW II/3, p. 5\u20137)\n\n\nSchelling refuses to allow that reason can confirm its status via its\nreflection in being:\n\nwhat we call the world, which is so completely contingent\nboth as a whole and in its parts, cannot possibly be the impression of\nsomething which has arisen by the necessity of reason\n(\u2026) it contains a preponderant mass of\nunreason. (Grundlegung der positiven Philosophie, p.\n99)\n\n\nThe contemporary ramifications of the debate between Schelling and\nHegel have been given new significance by the continuing elaboration\nof \u2018non-metaphysical\u2019 readings of Hegel by Robert Pippin\nand others. If Hegel is really the philosopher who insists that\nlegitimation can only be in terms of the account we can give of how we\ncame to adopt the forms of legitimation of our society, there being no\nextra-mundane perspective on these forms, how far is he from\nSchelling\u2019s moves against rationalist metaphysics in his later\nphilosophy? The difference between Hegel and Schelling seems here to\nlie above all in Schelling\u2019s insistence that one cannot reduce\nthe ways in which we face up to the terrors and irrationality of\nexistence to what can be achieved by a philosophical system that makes\nsense of negativity by showing it has a rational basis. His attention\nto art and the unconscious in his early philosophy already suggests\nthis direction in his later thinking.\n\nSchelling is one of the first philosophers seriously to begin the\ncritique of the model of metaphysics based on the idea of true\nrepresentation, a critique which can be seen as one of the key aspects\nof modern philosophy from Heidegger to the later Wittgenstein and\nbeyond. He is, at the same time, unlike some of his successors,\ncommitted to an account of human reason which does not assume that\nreason\u2019s incapacity to ground itself should lead to an\nabandonment of rationality or the reduction to reason to the exercise\nof power, in the manner of Nietzsche. This is one of the respects in\nwhich Schelling has again become part of contemporary philosophical\ndebate, where the need to seek means of legitimation which do not rely\non the notion of a rationality inherent in the world remains a major\nchallenge. Above all, Schelling\u2019s account of mind and world,\nparticularly his insistence on the need not to limit our conception of\nnature to what can be objectified by scientific methods, is, in the\nlight of the ecological crisis, proving to be more durable than his\nreception might until recently have suggested. The question Schelling\nstill poses is how the capacity for expanding human knowledge and\ncontrol of nature can be reconciled with sustainable ways of\ninhabiting that nature.\n6. The Schelling Revival\n\nPhilosophical responses to Schelling in the German-speaking world\nduring the post-War era form a fairly continuous tradition, with\nperhaps the main innovations being Frank 1975 and Schulz 1975, which\nshift some of the focus of research towards his late philosophy and\nthe critique of Hegel. In the English-speaking world, in contrast, a\nwider reception of Schelling only really got underway in the 1990s.\nThis was manifested in a considerable increase in the number of books\nand articles on, and translations of Schelling, and in the foundation\nof the American Schelling Society. The decisive shift here was the\nclaim that, rather than being, as he largely had been in Anglophone\nphilosophy, a stage on the path from Kant, via Fichte, to Hegel,\nSchelling actually opens up aspects of modern philosophy which are\nindependent of Hegelianism, and can challenge Hegel\u2019s systematic\nphilosophy (Bowie 1993). As Bowie showed, Schelling can therefore be\nbrought into productive connection with a range of philosophers, like\nHeidegger, Derrida, and others who have been influential in debates\nabout the nature and aims of modern philosophy. The ensuing reception\nof Schelling was given a boost by Zizek (1997), which shows how\nSchelling\u2019s philosophy relates closely to aspects of Lacan that\nform the focus of Zizek\u2019s previous work on Hegel. Since then the\ngrowing Schelling reception has taken divergent paths, which reflect\nthe perennially contested nature of Schelling interpretation. This\nreception involves some paradigmatic differences, of the kind that\nensue from conflicting ways of approaching texts from the history of\nphilosophy, from historicist reconstruction, to using the texts to\nquestion prevailing contemporary positions in philosophy in the way\nthe Anglophone reception of Hegel by Brandom, McDowell, Pippin, and\nothers has done. These differing approaches have offered new\nperspectives on the theological and other sources of Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy, detailed historical and philosophical analysis of the\nfiner detail of work from differing periods, Schelling\u2019s role in\nthe genesis of psychoanalysis (see, particularly, Ffytche (2012),\nwhich gives an exemplary historical, philosophical, and psychological\naccount of the issue), and competing claims as to what constitutes the\nessence of Schellingian philosophy.\n\nThe bibliography below gives an indication of the basic content of\nsome of the books that have appeared as part of the Schelling revival.\nThe tensions between the approaches in these books both point to key\nissues in the understanding of Schelling\u2019s philosophy, and\ninvolve difficulties that are inseparable from engagement with the\nhistory of philosophy. The attempt to interpret philosophy from the\npast demands an adequate reconstruction of the way philosophical\nissues were constituted in the era of the philosopher in question, on\nthe assumption that philosophy, in various ways, is constituted\ndialogically. Schelling\u2019s relationship to Kant and Fichte\nsuggests what is at issue here, and raises the further issue that how\nKant and Fichte themselves are interpreted repeats the same problem.\nAt the same time, if Schelling is to be seen as contributing to our\ncontemporary philosophical understanding, such contextual\nreconstruction can get in the way of interpretations which build\ncritically on his work with a view to using it to illuminate the\npresent. Examples of such issues are examined below in relation to\nsome characteristic recent contributions to the Schelling\nliterature.\n\nSome of Schelling\u2019s most important philosophical concerns relate\nto the modern understanding of nature, which is, of course, dominated\nby unparalleled advances in the natural sciences. One of the reasons\nSchelling came to be neglected was in part because his conception of\nnature in the Naturphilosophie was seen as being overtaken by\nthose sciences. The revival of interest in Schelling relates not least\nto the realisation that what is now seen in terms of the ecological\ncrisis can be interpreted in ways which suggest the kind of\nalternative conception of humankind\u2019s relationship to nature\nparadigmatically present in Schelling\u2019s objection to Fichte:\n\u2018in the last analysis what is the essence of his whole opinion\nof nature? It is this: that nature should be used [\u2026] and that\nit is there for nothing more than to be used; his principle, according\nto which he looks at nature, is the economic teleological\nprinciple\u2019 (SW I/7 p. 17). Jason Wirth argues that the\nindustrialised world\u2019s likely leading to the sixth Great\nExtinction event \u2018opens a space to appreciate the radicality of\nSchelling\u2019s ethical and ontological efforts to respond to the\npositivism and anthropocentrism at the heart of the ecological\ncrisis\u2019 (Wirth 2015: xv). He does so on the assumption that\n\u2018the basic case for Schelling\u2019s intrinsic interest and\ncontemporary relevance has been made (xi), so that we can move beyond\n\u2018explication\u2019 to \u2018develop the fundamental issues at\nstake in his thought\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nThe danger here is that such development can lead to wide-ranging\nclaims for Schelling that don\u2019t always take adequate account of\nother approaches to the issues. How far is Schelling\u2019s\n\u2018retrieval of the question of nature\u2019 (6) dependent on\nprecisely those aspects of his Naturphilosophie which came to\nbe widely rejected, and how can that philosophy be interpreted so that\nthe reasons for that rejection are overcome? Whether it can be\njustified by metaphysical argument or not, seeing nature in\nKant\u2019s \u2018formal\u2019 sense as a \u2018system of\nnecessary laws\u2019 is a plausible way of characterising one key\nassumption on which the investigations of the modern sciences are\nbased. If that were all that is to be said about nature, there would\nbe no point in trying to revive Schelling\u2019s undoubtedly fruitful\nviews on nature as a \u2018productivity\u2019, but neither can\nSchelling\u2019s conception be used as a wholesale alternative that\nsomehow obviates the \u2018formal\u2019 sense of nature.\n\nWirth maintains \u2018Schelling\u2019s nature from the perspective\nof its own living or wild ground \u2013 is no longer\nsurrounding us as a place in which are located. We are the\nearth\u2019s bio-regions\u2019 (22). Hamilton Grant (2005) can be\nseen as seeking to cash in such a claim: \u2018it is an argument of\nthis book, as it was of Schelling\u2019s, that metaphysics cannot be\npursued in isolation from physics. To do so entails the reconstruction\nnot only of Schelling\u2019s naturephilosophy, therefore, but the\nrepairing of the context from which it begins\u2019 (2005: 8).\nHamilton Grant provides a wealth of instructive historical detail from\nthat context, but then infers from it that \u2018the enemy in all\nthis is all post-Cartesian European philosophy\u2019s elimination of\nthe concept, even the existence, of nature, a deficiency common\nequally to Kant and the postkantians\u2019 (viii). It seems, though,\nhard to square this kind of totalising claim with aspects, especially\nof the early Marx and the Frankfurt School, for example, who were\ndirectly and indirectly influenced by Schelling.\n\nAny analysis of the issues here must take account of their relation to\nthe effects of political economy on how nature comes to be understood,\notherwise the philosophical perspective can actually obscure key\naspects of the issue of nature in modernity. There are evidently\nimportant issues here, and both Wirth and Hamilton Grant offer\ninteresting philosophical and historical perspectives on aspects of\nthem, but they do so at the risk of making claims that rely on a\nlimited, exclusively philosophical perspective: \u2018the present\nwork asserts firstly that Schellingianism is resurgent every time\nphilosophy reaches beyond the Kant-inspired critique of\nmetaphysics, its subjectivist-epistemological transcendentalism, and\nits isolation of physics from metaphysics\u2019 (5), and this\nentails \u2018the systematic undoing of the critical\nrevolution\u2019 (6). It perhaps makes more sense, however, to\nsuggest that a resurgence of \u2018Schellingianism\u2019, in the\nsense of radical questioning of humankind\u2019s relationship both to\ninternal and external nature, comes about when the concrete forms of\nthat relationship, as they do in the contemporary ecological crisis,\nresult in real historical breakdown. Whether a metaphysical account\nbuilding on Schelling\u2019s idea of nature as productivity rather\nthan product, or on the primacy of being before reflection can do more\nthan add to an already existing concrete historical\nrevelation of the blindness of certain influential forms of philosophy\nto alternative views of nature depends on how one now sees the tasks\nof philosophy in the face of that breakdown.\n\nFurther difficulties in the reception of Schelling relate to claims\nabout what the real core of his philosophy is, and these are\ncompounded by the fact that he changed the emphasis, if not\nnecessarily the underlying core, of his philosophy quite radically\nthroughout his career. It might be argued that, rather than seeking to\nlocate Schelling in a framework that is supposed to constitute the\nessence of his philosophy, one should use his explorations of nature,\nfreedom, language, theology, existence, etc., where they are most\nfruitful in relation to both historical and contemporary issues.\nWhistler (2013) and Matthews (2011) both make claims regarding the\ncore of Schelling\u2019s thinking, and thereby, while offering much\nscholarly and historical insight, and detailed attempts to explicate\nsome of Schelling\u2019s more intractable texts, can also obscure\nsome dimensions of that thinking. Both Whistler and Matthews attend\nalmost exclusively to Schelling\u2019s earlier\nNaturphilosophie and identity-philosophy.\n\nWhistler claims his \u2018book is, [\u2026], an attempt to\nreconstruct Schelling\u2019s philosophy of the time, the\nIdentita\u0308tssystem, by means of a focus on the role the\nsymbol plays therein\u2019 (Whistler 2012: vi). The book\u2019s\nvalue lies in its cogent and extensive reconstruction and\ninterpretation of some of the detail of that system, which has not\nbeen attempted before in English. However, this leads to claims like\nthe following, that in the Identita\u0308tssystem: \u2018an\nabsolute system is engendered which has no concern for reference or\nfor the integrity of particular scientific pursuits\u2019 (vii). This\nclaim depends not least on an admittedly sophisticated account of a\nsmall part of Schelling\u2019s Philosophy of Art on the\nnature of language as \u2018symbol\u2019 in a specific sense, which\nsees language as \u2018producing\u2019 its object, rather than as a\nform of representation of a pre-existing world. Language is here\nessentially performative, as in such things as promises, vows, etc.:\n\u2018Referential language talks about reality more or less\naccurately; productive language is reality more or less\nintensely\u2019 (208), so that \u2018Meaning is performed in and as\nbeing; it is thus wholly immanent to, and ultimately identical with,\nbeing\u2019 (201). The ultimate aim of this is to arrive at a new\nkind of theology: \u2018In short, theology must be poietic, not\nreferential \u2014 produce God, not refer to him (210).\n\nThere is much to be said for seeing language, in Charles\nTaylor\u2019s terms, as both \u2018constitutive\u2019\n(poietic), and \u2018designative\u2019 (referential), as the\ntradition from Hamann to Heidegger suggests. It is, though, hard to\nmake sense of a conception that seems so cavalier about how language\nis also changed by scientific activity that can invalidate previous\nways of talking about things. It is noticeable that such problems\narise when the goal of a Schelling interpretation is essentially\ntheological. Moreover, concentrating mainly on the early Schelling\nomits other dimensions of his view of language that can either\ncomplement or contradict what ensues from the ideas of the identity\nphilosophy. The later Schelling, for example, asserts: \u2018One is\nalmost tempted to say: language itself is only faded mythology, in it\nis preserved in only abstract and formal differences what mythology\npreserves in still living and concrete differences\u2019 (SW II/1 p.\n52). This sustains the idea of poiesis, but opens up different issues\nwith regard to language\u2019s relation to philosophy and\ntheology.\n\nMatthews also concentrates on the earlier Schelling from a perspective\nwhere theology plays a major role, revealing informative connections\nof the young Schelling\u2019s philosophy to Pietists such as\nFriedrich Christoph Oetinger and Phillip Matth\u00e4us Hahn, and\noffering discussions of how Schelling moves away from Kant. However,\nthe dangers of a theological interpretation of Schelling are already\napparent in Matthews\u2019 agenda: \u2018The speculative thesis of\nthis work is that there exists in the work of Schelling a possible\nschema for a new configuration of unity and freedom capable of\novercoming the destructive void of contemporary philosophy\u2019\n(Matthews 2011: 27). This supposedly new configuration involves:\n\u2018the realization of nature in its sacred status as the deity\nexternalized, the spirit of the divine made flesh\u2019 (30). What is\nat issue is supposed to be manifest in the experience of art that\ntranscends the \u2018static categories of the understanding\u2019\n(22): \u2018it is precisely this experience, this sublime realization\nof the oneness of our natures, which overcomes our alienation and\nredeems us, making us whole again with our nature\u2019 (34). These\nrather grandiose claims may have made some sense during the period of\nthe early Schelling, but invocation of \u2018a telos that requires\nhumans to act and order their lives so as to best express the harmony\nof the universe\u2019 (69) seems to ignore the subsequent\ndevelopments of modernity in science and technology, which manifests\nanything but the \u2018harmony of the universe\u2019.\n\nUsing theologically based interpretation of philosophy from the past\nwhile seeking to circumvent the political, social, and scientific\nexperience of the modern era too easily suggests avoidance rather than\nconfrontation of the contradictions of that era. Such an approach can\nreally only invoke Schelling if one keeps to his early work, and it is\nnotable that Matthews\u2019s does not mention the effects of Jacobi\nand the early Romantics even on the early Schelling\u2019s project,\nwhich make it hard to think of Schelling solely in terms of a\ntheological harmony. The claim that the early Schelling involves the\nidea that \u2018our way of thinking does, in this regard, actually\nmanifest the structure of nature\u2019 (183) also ignores\nSchelling\u2019s later existential claims, like the following:\n\u2018our self-consciousness is not at all the consciousness of that\nnature which has passed through everything, it is precisely just\nour consciousness \u2026 for the consciousness of man is\nnot = the consciousness of nature\u2026. Far from man and his\nactivity making the world comprehensible, man himself is that which is\nmost incomprehensible (SW II/3 pp. 5\u20137). If even Schelling\nhimself comes to question a theologically directed harmonisation of\nhumankind\u2019s relationship to the world, it seems questionable to\nconstruct an account of Schelling based wholly on the idea of such\nharmonisation.\n\nMcGrath (2021) also takes a predominantly theological approach, but\nthis time in an extensive and informative examination of\nSchelling\u2019s late philosophy: \u2018What is ultimately at stake\nin the Schelling\u2013Hegel dispute, then \u2013 and this is still\nnot sufficiently recognised by the new generation of scholars of\nGerman idealism \u2013 is the philosophical interpretation of\nChristianity, or as I will put it in this work, the interpretation of\nthe end of Christianity\u2019 (McGrath 2021: 6). The essential\ntension in philosophical interpretation of Schelling McGrath points to\nis suggested when he cites Markus Gabriel\u2019s deflationary\nunderstanding of \u2018God\u2019 in Schelling: \u2018For Schelling,\nit is crucial to note that \u201cGod\u201d refers to nothing more or\nless than the incessant and polymorphous becoming of intelligibility.\nGod is sense, the almost trivial fact that the ways we access the\nworld (our sense-making practices, which generate fields of sense)\nbelong to the world itself\u2019 (Gabriel 2015: 82). McGrath, in\ncontrast, talks in terms of: \u2018An absolute future when pantheism\nwill be real, when God will actually be everything, without\nany diminishment of the reality of individual things, the eventfulness\nof time or the freedom of the human being \u2013 this is the\nmaster-thought of the late Schelling\u2019 (McGrath 2021: 65).\n\nThere can be no philosophical argument that could substantiate such a\nvision, and this suggests where the philosophy/theology division\nbecomes decisive in Schelling interpretation. McGrath has to rely on\nfaith: \u2018By a theology of revelation I mean a theology which\nassumes, not blind fidelity to authoritatively pronounced\npropositions, but an ordinary intellect \u201cillumined\u201d by\nfaith\u2019 (11). This leads, rather as it does in Matthews, to some\nfairly grandiose claims: \u2018I mean to outline, elaborate and\nevaluate the logical, moral and existential arguments Schelling offers\nus for assuming revelation as an explanation for nature, the human\nsituation and history\u2019 (14), and \u2018Schelling is proposing\nthat the New Testament should be taken as offering us knowledge of\nultimate things, knowledge that can and should be appropriated by\nphilosophy in a post-Kantian register\u2019 (30). One\u2019s\nresponse to this will depend very much on one\u2019s relationship to\ntheology, but interpretations like the following can make one wary of\ntrying to actualise Schelling\u2019s philosophy from a theological\nperspective: \u2018Justice and a flourishing human civilisation will\nonly be achieved via a universal experience of the redeeming God\n\u2013 this is the social-political upshot of the Philosophy of\nRevelation\u2019 (240). The undeniable virtues of McGrath\u2019s\nbook lie in the wealth of detailed exploration of Schelling\u2019s\nlater texts, in his investigation of the distinction between negative\nand positive philosophy and its relationship to the critique of Hegel,\nand in his clarification of the idea of a \u2018philosophical\nreligion\u2019 that is to be achieved via positive philosophy:\n\u2018positive philosophy is the experience of the\neventfulness of history, the disclosure, which can only be empirical,\nof meaningful history\u2019 (50\u20131).\n\nWhat the recent philosophical and theological takes on Schelling can\nbe said to share is their insistence on his widening the scope of\n\u2018meaning\u2019 beyond a semantic view, to include all the ways\nin which the world is disclosed to us. Gabriel focuses on the\nPhilosophy of Mythology, and he sets himself an essentially\nphilosophical agenda in which it is read as a \u2018combination of\nthree approaches, an ontotheological, an anthropological, and one\nbased on the history of self-consciousness\u2019 (Gabriel 2006: 6),\nsuch that \u2018One can see in Schelling\u2019s thinking the attempt\nto shift the anthropological component of cognition into the centre of\nthe founding of metaphysics\u2019 (23). His \u2018concept of the\nhistory of religion as the history of self-consciousness is\nconstitutive for the whole of the Philosophy of Mythology\u2019 (52).\nWhereas modern natural scientific understanding sees meaning in terms\nof semantic relations between language and a world of physical\nobjects: \u2018Mythological consciousness [\u2026] does not\nexclusively inhabit a world of meaning, but rather a\nworld of meaningfulness\u2019 (31). Schelling therefore, in\na manner that is echoed in certain respects by Heidegger, \u2018seeks\nto oppose modern [scientistic] consciousness via the proof that it\narose from mythological consciousness\u2019 (31).\n\nAs such, what differentiates Schelling\u2019s \u2018history of\nself-consciousness\u2019 from Hegel\u2019s is that from his early\nphilosophy onwards \u2018the last thing for Schelling is always the\nadmission that self-consciousness comes up against a ground that\nprecedes it which it has itself not posited\u2019 (472\u20133). In\nthe System of Transcendental Idealism this is what leads to\nart being the culmination of the system, and, in the late philosophy,\nreligion as \u2018the reference (re-ligio) of consciousness to a\nbeing that is not posited by itself\u2019 (473). Although\nSchelling\u2019s late philosophy seeks to sustain the idea of a\npositive philosophy as \u2018a never completable proof of God\u2019\n(474), what remains most significant for contemporary understanding\nthat no longer thinks in theological terms is that \u2018our\nexistence is always accompanied by an ineliminable contingency or\nfacticity which corresponds to the fact that the world itself\nis groundless, even though its contents are necessarily connected to\neach other\u2019 (475\u20136). One way of seeing this, as suggested\nby Bowie (2022), is to focus on the enduring ways in which, as the\nearly Schelling and the early Romantics proposed, aesthetic questions\ncan show limitations in modern philosophy whose predominant focus is\nepistemological.\n\nSchelling was for a long time seen as a figure of the past. The\ncontributors to the Schelling revival all in some respects seek to\nrevive him for contemporary philosophy, which, as we have seen, can\nlead to perhaps rather grandiose claims. Such approaches do, though,\noffer challenges to some dominant ways of doing philosophy, but can at\ntimes risk excluding Schelling from more mainstream debate. Frank, as\nhas Gabriel both in the book just discussed and in other work, has\nshown that it is possible to interpret Schelling in ways which\ndirectly affect almost any approach to philosophy, be it\nEuropean/Continental, or analytic. Frank has recently done so by\nconsidering Schelling\u2019s explications, which he returns to in\nvarious ways throughout his career, of the \u2018identity of nature\nand spirit/mind [Geist]\u2019 (Frank 2018: X). His\nconclusion is that \u2018Schelling has shown the way out of a\nthousands of years old spiritualistic philosophy of the subject that\nis hostile to nature, and brought nature to the same level as\nspirit/mind\u2019 (269). This might also sound suspiciously\ngrandiose, but Frank both refers in detail to contextual historical\nsources that have been largely forgotten or neglected, and presents\nlogical and metaphysical reasons for taking Schelling\u2019s\nexplorations of identity seriously with respect to contemporary\ndebates concerning physicalism, reductive naturalism, and the\nlike.\n\nThe core idea here is that the very philosophical difficulties still\nencountered with respect to notions of \u2018identity\u2019 may\nactually themselves be an indication of something important,\nespecially with respect to the relationship between mind and nature.\nOne sense of identity leads, as Leibniz suggested, to the idea that\nthings are only ever strictly identical with themselves, which\nprecludes saying anything that differentiates a thing as something at\nall; the other sense of identity raises the problem that if things are\nto be identified \u2013 knowledge being otherwise impossible \u2013\nthey must differ from themselves in some sense, which seems\nparadoxical. Schelling therefore thinks that \u2018both sameness\n(\u2018Einfachheit\u2019) and difference \u2013 thus something like\nself-differentiation \u2013 have to be assumed in the thought of\nidentity\u2019 (109).\n\nFrank traces the history of the notion of \u2018reduplicative\nidentity\u2019 and its adoption by Schelling to explicate what makes\nthis idea plausible. This leads to the following: \u2018For identity\nis after all a symmetrical relationship [\u2026] For this reason it\nis meaningless to call an identity theory more\n\u201cidealist/mentalist\u201d than \u201cmaterialist\u201d. It is\nneither of the two and both at once, as Schelling so neatly puts\nit\u2019 (224). The basic position is summed up as follows:\n\n\u2018Spirit/mind and nature are One\u2019 is understood as: There\nis an X, and this X is on the one hand A (spirit/mind), and on the\nother B (nature). B as B is not \u2018the same\u2019\n(\u2018einerlei\u2019) as A; and A as A is not the same as\nB. The identity of the two rests on their\nbeing-equally-sustained-in-being by X (or absolute being) (211).\n\n\nIn the terms of contemporary philosophical debate: \u2018Types of\nmental and types of neuronal states are not in themselves \u2013 or\nnot metaphysically \u2013 different (namely not to the extent which\nthey are sustained by X. They are only different from a conceptual (or\nepistemological) perspective\u2019 (232). In such a relation of\nidentity \u2018two different but equally rigid designations\u2019\nare involved, \u2018each of which could be sufficient to adequately\ndetermine the object and which both apply to the same thing (X)\u2019\n(252\u20133). Identity of nature and spirit therefore \u2018appears\n(as opposed to logical freedom from contradiction) to include in it a\nkind of difference\u2019 (251).\n\nThis position can be seen as avoiding both the kind of questionable\nbracketing of modern natural science seen in some of the\nmetaphysical/theological accounts considered above, and the kind of\nreductive physicalism and scientism that plays too much of a role in\ncertain parts of neuroscience-oriented analytical philosophy. A\nSchellingian account of identity resists any attempt to reduce the\nways in which meaning arises in the world, such reductions being\ncharacteristic of philosophy which sees cognitive control as its major\nconcern. Axel Hutter suggests one implication of this when he talks of\nhow Schelling reveals\n\nthe decisive state of affairs for modern history, that the modern\nimpulse for emancipation has turned into its opposite in being carried\nout concretely in history. Modern thought falls prey, after it has\nemancipated itself from external attachment to the authority of\nrevelation, which it does completely justifiably, to another power:\nthe \u2018nature\u2019 of its cognitive capacity, which it now obeys\nmore blindly than it previously obeyed external authorities (Hutter\n1996: 300).\n\n\nIn this sense, Schelling can be seen as inaugurating the idea of a\n\u2018dialectic of Enlightenment\u2019. The freedom that Schelling\nsees as inseparable from philosophy is the potential to see that\nwholesale focus on cognitive certainty can, for all the benefits it\nmay offer, become precisely what we need to emancipate ourselves from,\nbecause we make sense of the world in many ways which cannot be\nreduced to cognition. Reason must therefore incorporate a sense of its\nown fallibility and historicity, because it involves what Schelling\nterms the \u2018dark ground which must nevertheless be the ground of\ncognition\u2019 (SW I.7: 413). We don\u2019t always deal with needs\nand impulses, or with the meanings we gain from involvement in the\nnatural world, just by knowing about the needs and about why something\nappears beautiful, overwhelming, senseless, etc. Instead we may act\nexpressively, seeking sense in ways which cognitive command of the\nworld cannot provide. How much the revival of Schellingian concerns\nmight affect a world in which human relations to nature are evidently\nin crisis remains to be seen.\n",
