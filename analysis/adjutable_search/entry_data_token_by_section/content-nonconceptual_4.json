    "main_text": "Applying the notion of nonconceptual content || Perceptual experience and nonconceptual content\n4.1 Perceptual experience and nonconceptual content\n\nWe can think about the content of perception in conceptual terms. When\nsomeone has a visual experience, for example, it will seem to that\nperson as if something is seen. One way of specifying the way things\nappear to the subject is in terms of the perceptual belief the subject\nwould form on the basis of perception had he taken his perception at\nface value. Such a way of specifying the representational content of\nperception gives us the propositional content of perception. Theorists\nof nonconceptual content have canvassed several types of reasons for\nthinking that this propositional content does not exhaust the\nrepresentational content of perception (see the entry on\n the contents of perception).[6]\n\nFirst, it has been argued that the contents of perception exhibit\ncertain features that cannot be exhibited by the contents of the\npropositional attitudes. In particular, perception is capable of\nrepresenting impossible or contradictory states of affairs, as is the\ncase when viewing certain Escher drawings and when undergoing various\nperceptual illusions. In contrast, it is argued that conceptual\ncontent must be consistent\u2014one cannot have a belief with a\ncontradictory content. Thus, Crane argues that reflecting on the\nwaterfall illusion shows that the contents of perception cannot be\nconceptual (Crane 1988a). Since one cannot undergo a state with\ncontradictory conceptual contents, and yet the waterfall\nillusion is a perceptual state with contradictory content\u2014the\nobject perceived seems to be both moving and not moving\u2014it\ncannot be the case that perception involves conceptual contents (for\nmore on this argument see, e.g., Mellor 1988, Crane 1988b, Crane 1992,\nand Gunther 2001).\n\nSecond, it has been argued that the content of perception is analog in\nnature, unlike the conceptual content of propositional attitudes which\nis more plausibly seen as digital. The distinction between analog and\ndigital representations has (for our purposes) been most perspicuously\nput by Fred Dretske (1981, Ch.6). Let us take a particular\nfact or state of affairs, say the fact or state of affairs that some\nobject s has property F. A representation carries\nthe information that s is F in digital form if and\nonly if it carries no further information about s other than\nthat it is F (and whatever further facts about it are\nentailed by the fact that it is F). But whenever a\nrepresentation carries the information that s is F\nin analog form it always carries additional information about\ns. Nonconceptualists argue that, while propositional\nattitudes represent the world in digital form, perceptual states\nrepresent the world in analog form. Beck (2012) argues that analog\nmagnitude states are nonconceptual because they lack the\nrecombinability necessary for concepts (as articulated, for example,\nin Evans\u2019s Generality\n Constraint).[7]\n\nThird, it has been suggested that the content of perception is\nunit-free (Peacocke 1986). If I perceptually represent an object as\nbeing a certain distance from me, I do not usually represent that\ndistance in terms of a particular unit (in inches, say, as opposed to\ncentimeters), even though what I represent is a perfectly determinate\ndistance. I simply represent it as being that distance, where\nthe content of my perception specifies the distance. Peacocke (1986,\n1989) argues extensively against the possibility of accommodating such\nunit-free representations in purely propositional terms.\n\nFourth, nonconceptualists argue that the content of perception is more\nfine-grained than the content of propositional attitudes. This\nargument can be traced back to Evans, who asks, rhetorically,\n\u201cDo we really understand the proposal that we have as many color\nconcepts as there are shades of color that we can sensibly\ndiscriminate?\u201d (Evans 1982, p. 229). Arguably, I can\nperceptually discriminate many more colors and shapes than I currently\nhave concepts for. Although I may be capable of discriminating between\ntwo color chips of very similar shades of red, red27\nand red29,\nnot being an expert on colors I will not have the concepts\nred27 and red29.\nWith my limited conceptual repertoire,\nI will correctly judge both color chips to be red. However, I will so\njudge on the basis of experiences whose contents are much more\nspecific and fine grained in a way that cannot be captured by my\nconceptual capacities. (The same is true, mutatis mutandis,\nof shape concepts.) My ability to perceive and discriminate the\ndeterminate shades and shapes that I do outstrips my conceptual\ncapacities. As such, my experiences do not seem to depend on my\nconceptual repertoire. Thus, in specifying the content of perception,\nits accuracy conditions, we need not limit ourselves to the concepts\navailable to the subject\u2014hence, perceptual content is\nnonconceptual (e.g., Peacocke 1992, Heck 2000, Tye 1995, 2006.\nDeBellis 1995, and Luntley 2003, argue on similar lines for the\nnonconceptual content of music perception).\n\nOf these, the argument from the fine-grained nature of perception has\ngenerated the most discussion. Opponents of the idea that perceptual\ncontent might be nonconceptual argue that the fineness of grain of\nperceptual experience can in fact be accommodated at the conceptual\nlevel. John McDowell, for example, suggests that the considerations\nEvans raises have force only if we limit the types of concepts\nexpected to figure in the content of perception to such general\nconcepts as red27,\nred29, etc., but, he\nargues, there is no reason to suppose that the conceptual content of\nperception needs to be limited in this way. Rather, the conceptual\ncontent of perceptual experiences is given by demonstrative concepts,\nsuch as that shade (McDowell\n 1994a).[8]\n He claims that our conceptual capacities are capable of\nrepresenting colors with the same fineness of grain with which they\nare perceptually represented. The information loss in the transition\nfrom perception to perceptual belief is not a sign that there are two\ndifferent types of content in play, but should rather be understood as\na transition from a more determinate type of conceptual content (e.g.,\nthat is colored thus) to a less determinate type of\nconceptual content (e.g., that is red).\n\nSeveral objections have been raised against attempts to account for\nthe contents of perception in terms of demonstrative concepts. First,\nfor a capacity operative in perception to count as a genuine\nconceptual capacity it must be possible for that same capacity to be\nemployed in thought. As such, it must be the case that such\ndemonstrative concepts as are arguably involved in the content of\nperception are retained long enough for the possibility of their\nremobilization\u2014they cannot be reserved only for the particular\ninstance in which the sample is perceived. Although the appearance of\nthe demonstrative concept expressible by the phrase \u2018\u2026 is\ncolored thus\u2019 can exploit the presence of the red27\ncolor chip and account for the\nperson\u2019s fine-grained experience of the chip, the demonstrative\nconcept\u2019s applicability cannot be limited to the presence of\nthis sample. As McDowell says, the capacity for employing\ndemonstrative concepts in perception is a recognitional capacity\n(McDowell 1994a p. 57, Brewer 1999 also holds that a conceptual\ncapacity must be available in the absence of the sample to which it\nwas initially applied). Kelly (2001a) calls this constraint \u2018the\nre-identification condition\u2019 on concept possession.\n\nHowever, the objection goes, it is evident that our capacities for\nperceptual discrimination far outstrip our capacities for recognition.\nRegardless of how short the interval between two presentations of a\nspecific shade it is reasonable to suppose that an organism is capable\nof perceiving the shade in all its fineness of grain without being\ncapable of recognizing it as the shade presented earlier. There simply\ndoes not seem to be a dependence between our fine grained perceptual\ncapacities and our memory capacities. But since the recognitional\ndemonstrative concepts the conceptualist appeals to do depend on such\nmemory capacities (according to the re-identification condition), it\ncannot be the case that our having such demonstrative concepts is\nnecessary for our enjoying fine grained perceptual discriminations.\n(For discussion of empirical support for the claim that memory is\ncoarser grained than our capacities for perceptual discrimination, see\nRaffman 1995. See also Kelly 2001a, Peacocke 2001a, 2001b, Tye 2006,\nWright 2003, Dokic and Pacherie 2001 for arguments on similar\ngrounds).\n\nOne response to this objection would be to revise (Brewer 2005) the\nre-identification constraint on the possession of demonstrative\nconcepts, or perhaps retract it altogether (Chuard 2006 explores\nvarious versions of the re-identification condition and argues that\nnone are necessary for the possession of demonstrative concepts).\nKelly (2001a), and Dokic and Pacherie (2001), however, argue that the\nre-identification condition is essential to concept possession.\n\nTwo potential challenges to the appeal to demonstrative concepts have\nbeen highlighted. The first can be termed the priority argument. It\nholds that we cannot take demonstrative concepts as explanatorily\nbasic. The demonstrative concepts I possess are a function of my\ndemonstrative capacities and part of what explains my having a given\ndemonstrative capacity is my having certain associated experiences;\nthe experience must be prior to the possession of the demonstrative\nconcept if the former is to explain the latter (Heck 2000). Various\nformulations of this argument have been developed (see Ayers 2002,\nHopp 2009, Roskies 2008, 2010, and Levine 2010). For example, Levine\n(2010) argues that \u201c[w]hen you see a color and think \u2018that\ncolor\u2019, the seeing is prior to the demonstrating, or else you\nreally don\u2019t know what you\u2019re demonstrating\u2026 But if\nthe seeing, the perceptual experience, is prior to the demonstrating,\nthen the demonstrating can\u2019t be what captures, or brings into\nexistence, the content of that experience\u201d (p. 191). Brewer has\nprovided a response to this kind of objection, following a suggestion\nrejected by Heck (2000), on the grounds that the form of explanation\nthat we should look for is not a causal explanation, which\nwould indeed require the priority of the experience, but a\nconstitutive one. Thus he says that \u201cOn the\nconceptualist view, experience of a colour sample, R, just is a matter\nof entertaining a content in which the demonstrative concept\n\u2018thatR shade\u2019 figures as\na constituent\u201d (Brewer 2005, p. 221, see also Brewer 2002).\n\nA second challenge comes from the so-called argument from\nnon-veridical experience (Heck 2000). Suppose that a subject has a\nnon-veridical experience as of a shade of color that does not exist in\nnature and that has never previous appeared in her experience. Then\nthe subject cannot have an appropriate demonstrative concept, as there\nis nothing to fix the reference of that concept. For a response to\nthis argument see Bengson, Grube, and Korman 2011.\n\nBefore moving to other arguments that have been advanced on behalf of\nnonconceptualism it is worth remarking that the conceptualist appeal\nto demonstrative concepts in response to the fineness of grain\nargument is a response to a challenge to their position, rather than\nan argument for conceptualism. The point of the fineness of grain\nargument is to put pressure on the possibility of a subject possessing\nall the concepts required for a correct specification of the contents\nof perception. If the subject cannot have these concepts and\nyet is capable of undergoing the perception, then it follows that the\ncontent of perception is nonconceptual. However, showing that the\nsubject does have these concepts is not yet an argument for\nthe conceptualist position. For the conceptualist claim to follow,\nthey must show not that the content of perception is in fact\nconceptualizable by the subject undergoing the experience in all of\nits fine grain, as the availability of demonstrative concepts\nsuggests, but rather that the subject cannot undergo the\nexperience without possessing these concepts. Thus even if\nthe conceptualists manage to show that subjects do possess all the\nconcepts involved in the correct specification of the content of\nperception, it still does not show that the content of perception is\nconceptual, it only undercuts the motivation the nonconceptualist can\nobtain from the fineness of grain argument (Coliva 2003,\nBerm\u00fadez 2007).\n\nA fifth argument, related to the priority argument against the appeal\nto demonstrative concepts above, pertains to the possibility of\nconcept acquisition or learning. Presumably what explains our coming\nto possess the observational concepts that we do is our undergoing\nappropriately related perceptual experiences (see, e.g., Peacocke\n1992, 2001a, Ayers 2004). If this is so, it cannot be the case, on\npain of circularity, that undergoing a particular perceptual\nexperience depends on possessing the very concepts the acquisition of\nwhich the experience explain. Roskies (2008) argues that if we reject\nthe claim that perception with nonconceptual content plays an\nessential role in concept acquisition, we cannot account for our\nacquisition of observational concepts without being committed to an\nunacceptable form of nativism. (See also Forman 2006 for a different\nargument purporting to show the necessity of perception with\nnonconceptual content to concept learning.)\n\nA sixth argument for the nonconceptual content of perception derives\nfrom Kelly (2001b). He argues that the central reason perception must\nbe nonconceptual is that the experience of a property depends on the\nsituation in which it is perceived and depends on the object which it\ncharacterizes in a way that demonstrative concepts do not. An example\nof the first sort of dependency is given by the phenomenon of color\nconstancy. In this case we can see two samples of the same color\nproperty illuminated differently (e.g., when looking at a wall that is\npartially exposed to the sun) and experience both to be of the same\ncolor but because of the different illumination we experience them\ndifferently (one is better illuminated than the other). The problem is\nthat since the color is the same regardless of the illumination,\ndemonstrative concepts such as that color cannot be\nsufficient to capture the experiential difference between the\ndifferently illuminated samples; though the experiences differ, the\ncontribution of the demonstrative concept that color to the\ncontent of the experience is the same, given that the property\nperceived, that color in both demonstrations, is the same.\nDemonstrative concepts, Kelly argues, refer to situation independent\nfeatures of the world (e.g., the actual color of the wall) and thus\nare not capable of capturing the situation dependence of perceptual\ncontent. The argument from the situation dependence of perceptual\ncontent has been subject to several criticisms on behalf of the\nconceptualist. One such criticism (Peacocke 2001b) is that, contrary\nto Kelly, it seems reasonable that the difference in experience\ncan be captured by concepts regarding the illumination of the\ndifferent samples (see also Ablondi 2002).\n\nFinally, there is the argument from infant/animal cognition, which\nPeacocke now considers the most important motivation for thinking that\nperception has nonconceptual content (Peacocke 2001a, 2001b, referring\nto Evans 1982, Dretske 1995, Berm\u00fadez 1994, 1998).\nConsiderations of phylogenetic and ontogenetic continuities in nature\nsuggest that animals and infants can have experiences very similar to\nour own. They too perceptually represent the brown tree amidst the\nlush green grass. However, since they lack concepts appropriate for a\ncorrect specification of the contents of their perception, their\nperceptual representation of this state of affairs must be\nnonconceptual. If we share these perceptual capacities with such\nanimals and human infants then it is reasonable to suggest that the\ncontent of our experiences is also, at least in part, nonconceptual\n(see also Schellenberg 2013, 2018). Of course, it may be the case that\nour experience is richer than that of animals and that we are capable\nof many more perceptual discriminations than they are capable of, but\nto the extent that we share our perceptual representations with such\nanimals, the content of our perceptual representations should be\nequally nonconceptual. (See more on this in section\n 4.3)\n\nA crucial aspect of the debate is whether theorists of nonconceptual\ncontent can account for the rational role of perceptual states in\nbelief formation. Although much of the discussion of whether\nperceptual content can be nonconceptual has focused on precisely how\nthe manifest differences between perceptions and beliefs should be\ndescribed (see, e.g., Kelly 2001b, Sedivy 1996, 2006), the important\nissue is whether those differences can be captured at the level of\ncontent in a way that explains how perceptions can justify beliefs.\nMcDowell\u2019s central claim is that there can be appropriate\nrational relations between perceptions and beliefs only if perceptions\nhave conceptual contents, on the grounds that such rational relations\ncan hold only between conceptual states (McDowell 1994a, 2006). This\nis a powerful challenge to defenders of nonconceptual content. It is\nfar from clear, however, that they do not have the resources to meet\nit. This is an issue that has been much discussed in the philosophy of\nperception (most recently in Lerman 2010 and Cahen 2019).\n\nMillar (1991), for example, offers a sophisticated account of how the\nrepresentational content of perceptions can justify beliefs formed on\nthe basis of those perceptions, even though the relevant contents are\nnot conceptually individuated. One obvious strategy for the defender\nof nonconceptual content would be to argue that a nonconceptual\ncontent can stand in logical or evidential relations (such as the\nrelation of being consistent with, or making more probable) to another\nstate even though it is not conceptually articulated (see, e.g., Heck\n2000, Vision 2009). Another possibility would be to follow Peacocke\n(2001a, 2004a, 2004b) who argues that the rational role of a\nnonconceptual way of representing some X is guaranteed when the\nobservational concept X is partially individuated by its\nrelation to such a way of nonconceptually representing X. So, a\nsubject may rationally judge that is a square when taking her\nexperience at face value not only because her perception\ninvolves a nonconceptual way of representing a square but for that\nreason, since such a nonconceptual way of representing squares is\npart of the individuation conditions of the concept square.\nFurthermore, the subject is capable of reflecting on her reasons for\nso judging by asking herself whether the way things (nonconceptually)\nlook to her is reason for her to make the judgment that she does.\nBrewer (2005) argues against such proposals on the grounds that they\ndo not manage to account for the subject\u2019s appreciation of her\nperception as a reason for a given judgment without being\ncommitted to a form of foundationalism with its various difficulties.\nIf, however, perception does involve conceptual content, then\naccording to Brewer, we can account for the subject\u2019s\nappreciation of her perception as a reason for a given judgment\nstraightforwardly, since the subject\u2019s having a perception with\nconceptual content already requires that she grasps the rational\nrelations perception with such a content stands to other states with\nconceptual contents.\n\nAdvocates of the state/content distinction, discussed in section\n 3,\n point out that although arguments for the nonconceptual nature of\nperception are typically aimed at articulating the nature of the\ncontents of perception, that is, whether perception is\ncontent-nonconceptual or content-conceptual, the premises of these\narguments seem to support at most a \u201cstate\u201d conclusion\n(Byrne 2003, 2005, Speaks 2005, Crowther 2006, Heck 2007). For\nexample, the argument from the fine grained nature of experience\ngenerally begins by arguing that one need not have the concepts\ninvolved in the correct specification of the content of perception in\norder to undergo a perception with that content, e.g., one need not\nhave the concept red27 in\norder to have a perception correctly specifiable in terms of such a\nconcept. But though this is merely reason to hold that perception is\nstate-nonconceptual, the conclusion drawn from such an observation is\nthat the content of perception is nonconceptual. (Heck 2007\nalso points this fault in the standard forms of the fineness of grain\nargument and proceeds to develop a form of the argument which he\nthinks avoids this problem and is genuinely directed at the\n\u201ccontent\u201d view.) However, if the distinction between\nconcept-dependent and concept-independent state types ultimately rests\non a distinction between the types of content involved in these\nstates, as suggested in section\n 3,\n then the transition from\nstate-nonconceptualism to content-nonconceptualism (and from\nstate-conceptualism to content-conceptualism) is a legitimate one. We\nwould, then, have good reason to consider the arguments above as\ndirectly relevant to the nonconceptual content of perception\neven though they often proceed via claims about the capacities\nrequired of a creature for having perceptual states.\n",
