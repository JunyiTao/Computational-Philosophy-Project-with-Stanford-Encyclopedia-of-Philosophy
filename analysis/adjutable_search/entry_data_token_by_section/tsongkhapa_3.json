    "main_text": "Early Period || Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser phreng)\n2.2 Golden Garland (Legs bshad gser phreng)\n\nTsongkhapa's Golden Garland is his most important early work.\nIt takes the form of a long explanation of the Perfection of\nWisdom s\u016btras, given pride of place in the Kanjur as the\nforemost words of the Buddha, after the Vinaya section (the\ncodifications of ethical conduct). It is a word-by-word commentary on\nthe topics in the Ornament for the Clear Realizations\n(Abhisamay\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra). Tsongkhapa bases his\nexplanation on two sub-commentaries by \u0100rya Vimuktisena (sixth\ncentury?) and Hari Bhadra (end of the eighth century). It propounds a\nphilosophy that later Gelukpas, following the taxonomy developed in\nthe mature works of Tsongkhapa, call\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka, in essence a Middle\nWay that incorporates many of the categories of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nBuddhism, yet does not have the authority of Candrak\u012brti's\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika interpretation.\n\nA great deal has been written on the difference between\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and Sv\u0101tantrika (Dreyfus and McClintock\n2003). Historically, the Gelukpa's\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka is another name for the\nmainstream philosophical school that developed in Tibet, based\nprimarily on the teaching of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and his\nstudent Kamala\u015b\u012bla (both fl. end of the eight century), the\nmost influential of all the Indian pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas involved in\nthe dissemination of Buddhist ideas to Tibet. Later Gelukpa\nscholastics, basing themselves on the mature works of Tsongkhapa, are\nunequivocal that Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka, like\nthe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy of Asa\u1e45ga, is wrong, and has\nonly heuristic value. At the same time, they tacitly acknowledge its\ncentrality by taking this \u201cwrong\u201d philosophy as the\nfoundation of their studies.\n\nIn the Golden Garland, Tsongkhapa, following\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's school as it developed in Tibet,\nasserts that all bases (Sk. vastu) (the psycho-physical\nfactors locating the person as they begin their philosophical career),\nall mental states along the course of the path (Sk.\nm\u0101rga), and the final result, are illusory, because they\nlack any essential nature. But it is not yet clear how the basis\nrelates to the final outcome (the result). As explained below,\nTsongkhapa will solve the problem in his mature works by a clear,\nradical, nihilistic leap denying any essential nature whatsoever,\nanywhere, to anything, thereby implicitly and explicitly devaluing (in\nabsolutist terms) the ontological status of the final, pure, unified\nstate, relegating it to just one more conventional,\ndependently-originated thing.\n\nIn the Golden Garland, Tsongkhapa has not yet fully developed\nhis mature, systematic philosophy. He is still content with\ndiscrediting Dolpopa and surveying different points of view. He uses\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra terminology to present his own opinion, and uses a\nlanguage to describe enlightened (and enlightening) knowledge that\nretains for it a separateness (through its freedom from all mental\nconstruction) from all other mental states. The primary object of\nphilosophical inquiry in the Golden Garland is the unity of\nthe perceiving subject in enlightenment, a topic that reflects the\nlanguage and concerns of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra-sv\u0101tantrika-madhyamaka school. \n\nTsongkhapa in this early work is still comfortable with characterizing\nthe ultimate as an absence of elaboration (Tib. spros bral,\nSk. ni\u1e63prapa\u00f1ca) beyond the four extremes, later\nset forth as the orthodox view of the Sakya sect. Tsongkhapa's\nrejection of this characterization in his later work occasions a\nstrong rejection of his view by writers like Gorampa (Go rab\n'byams pa bsod nams sge ge) (1429-1489) (Cabezon and Dargyay\n2006).\n\nThe Golden Garland is driven in no small measure by an agenda\ndedicated to discrediting Dolpopa's Perfection of Wisdom\ncommentaries. This is evident from a comparison of Dolpopa and\nTsongkhapa's sources and views. While Dolpopa excoriates \u0100rya\nVimuktisena and Hari Bhadra and says they belong to the degenerate\nage, propounding doctrines harmful to golden age Buddhism, the\nGolden Garland privileges the commentaries by \u0100rya\nVimuktisena and Hari Bhadra. Dolpopa says the two Detailed\nExplanations of the Perfection of Wisdom S\u016btras (Sk.\nB\u1e5bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, Tib. Gnod\n'jom) by \u201cthe foremost, Great Middle Way master\nVasubandhu\u201d stand as the primary scriptural authority for the\nGreat Middle Way doctrine, superior even to the partial truths\nrevealed by N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. The Golden Garland disputes\nthat Vasubandhu is the author of the two Detailed\nExplanations, and says, regardless of their author, they are\nsimply restatements of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Middle Way. Finally,\nDolpopa propounds a doctrine that holds the basis, path, and result\nare eternally the same, and all else is thoroughly imaginary, but the\nGolden Garland is certain that such a view is wrong, and\ndirectly cites a passage from Dolpopa's work, though without naming\nits author, saying, \u201csince no other great path-breaker, [i.e.,\nfounder of an original philosophy] besides him has ever asserted [what\nDolpopa says], learned persons are right to cast out [what he says]\nlike a gob of spit\u201d (Sparham 2007-2013 vol. 1, 425).\n",
