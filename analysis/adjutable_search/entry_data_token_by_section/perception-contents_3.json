    "main_text": "Contents as Accuracy Conditions || Beliefs and Experiences\n2.2 Beliefs and Experiences\n\nThere are many ways of developing the idea that experiences are\nassessable for accuracy. One idea is that the contents of experience\nderive in some fashion from the contents of beliefs, so that\nexperiences bear some constitutive link to beliefs. Three sorts of\nconstitutive links to belief have been discussed in the literature.\nThe first is that experiences are acquisitions of beliefs;\nthe second is that they are dispositions to form beliefs; the\nthird is that they are grounds of dispositions to form\nbeliefs. A fourth position simply identifies experiences with beliefs\nabout how things look (Gluer 2009), or even more simply, with beliefs\nwhose content characterizes the way things look (Bryne 2016).\n\nFirst, suppose experiences are acquisition of beliefs formed\nby a standard use of a perceptual apparatus. When applied to visual\nexperiences, this view says that for as long as you see something that\nlooks like a red, shiny fish in front of you, you are acquiring a\nbelief that there is a red, shiny fish in front of you. The content of\nexperience, on this view, will be the same as the content of the\nbeliefs with whose acquisition the experience is identical. And what\nmakes a content the content of an experience, as opposed to some other\nkind of mental state, will be whatever makes it the content of those\nbeliefs. (This view is critically discussed by Pitcher in his 1971,\nchapter 2.)\n\nA standard objection to so identifying experiences with the\nacquisition of beliefs is that one may not believe that things are the\nway they appear. (This objection is discussed by Pitcher, op cit, and\nby Armstrong 1968). For instance, if you have background knowledge\nthat despite appearances there is no red shiny fish in front of you,\nthen you will not believe that there is one. To accommodate this\nobjection, the relation between experiences and the acquisition of\nbeliefs must be something other than identity.\n\nSecond, suppose that experiences are dispositions on the part\nof the subject of the experience to form beliefs. This view is\ndefended by D. Armstrong (1968), G. Pitcher (1971), D. Dennett (1991).\nWhich disposition an experience is, on this view, depends on\nhow things appear to the subject in the experience. For instance, if\nyou seem to see a red shiny fish in front of you, then (on this view)\nyou have a disposition to believe that there is a fish in front of\nyou, and your experience is identical with this disposition.\n\nIf experiences are dispositions on the part of the subject to form\nbeliefs about how things appear to her, a natural accompanying view\nabout the contents of experience is that these just are the contents\nof the beliefs one is disposed to form. According to this view, what\nmakes some contents contents of experience, as opposed to\nbeing contents of some other kind of mental state, is in part that one\nis disposed to believe those contents.\n\nOne could then develop the idea that experiences are assessable for\naccuracy in the following way:\n\nHaving an experience consists in being disposed to form certain\nbeliefs.\nThe conditions under which the experience is accurate (i.e., its\ncontents) are the same as the conditions under which the beliefs one\nis constitutively disposed to form in having the experience are\naccurate. (Equivalently, the contents of experience are the contents\nof the beliefs one is constitutively disposed to form in having\nit).\n\n\nPitcher\u2019s view in his 1971 is (a). Claim (b) is a natural\nextension of (a), given the assumption that beliefs have accuracy\nconditions. (Pitcher doesn\u2019t talk explicitly about accuracy\nconditions).\n\nOne difficulty with (a), and so with (a) and (b), is that it leaves\nopen how the relevant dispositions must be grounded. You could be\ndisposed to believe that there was music playing next door because\nsomeone told you it was, and yet, it seems, not hear or even seem to\nhear any music: you might be totally deaf, for instance. In this case\nyou would not have any auditory experience of music, despite being\ndisposed to believe that music is playing. So proponents of (a) seem\nwell-advised to specify an appropriate ground for the dispositions\nthey identify with experiences, so that they do not misclassify as\nexperiences events that intuitively are not experiences.\n\nThis brings us to the third position on the relation between\nexperience and belief: that experiences are perceptual grounds of\ndispositions to form beliefs. Just what a specifically perceptual\nground is has to be spelled out\u2014a natural suggestion is that it\nrequires a certain etiology involving sensory organs, or functional\nequivalents. Given this third position, a natural accompanying\nconception of the contents of an experience is that they are the same\nas the contents of beliefs that one is disposed to form in having the\nexperience (claim (b) above). However, another version of the view\nmight hold that although the experience itself is constitutively\nlinked to beliefs, it does not have contents that are\nconstitutively linked to the contents of the beliefs.\n\nClaim (b) above, which identifies the contents of an experience with\ncontents of beliefs one is disposed to form in having the experience,\nassumes that the contents of both kinds of state can be the same. Some\nphilosophers have argued that the contents of such states must differ.\nIf this is correct then none of the views here mentioned can be\ncorrect as stated. (For discussion of how the views might be modified,\nsee\n Section 6.2\n below, and the entry on\n non-conceptual content.)\n \n\nAnother objection to views that posit constitutive links between\nexperiences and beliefs, or between experiential contents and belief\ncontents focuses on primitive creatures that can have experiences,\neven though they lack the capacity and disposition to form beliefs.\nSuch creatures would seem to be impossible if experiences were\nconstitutively linked to beliefs, as the views discussed here hold.\nThis objection seems to apply to the position that identifies\nexperiences with beliefs about the ways things look (defended by\nGl\u00fcer 2009). In contrast, Gl\u00fcer\u2019s (2009) view seems\nimmune from the objection that assimilating perceptual experience to\nbelief would entail that subjects of known illusions have\ncontradictory beliefs, and so are irrational. This objection applies\nto Byrne (2016), who argues that this consequence is plausible. \n",
