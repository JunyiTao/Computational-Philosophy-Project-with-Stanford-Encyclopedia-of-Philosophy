    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || God\u2019s Moral Attributes\n8.4 The Conclusion: Part 12\n\nWith Demea\u2019s departure, Cleanthes and Philo are left to finish\nthe conversation. Their tone is conciliatory, so conciliatory that\nPhilo says he must \u201cconfess\u201d that although he is less\ncautious about natural religion than any other subject,\n\n\nno one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind, or pays\nmore profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself\nto reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature.\n(DCNR 12.2/89)\n\n\nPhilo\u2019s \u201cconfession\u201d paves the way for a blockbuster\nthat has puzzled generations of readers. Philo seems to reverse field,\napparently recanting what he has argued for so forcefully. He grants\nCleanthes that \u201ca purpose, an intention, a design, strikes\neverywhere the most careless, the most stupid thinker\u201d (DCNR\n12.2/89).\n\nHis remarks are, however, by no means straightforward. Some take\nPhilo\u2014and, by implication, Hume\u2014to be outing himself as a\ncloset theist. Others conclude that, since he holds all the cards at\nthis point, he can afford to be conciliatory. Read ironically, Philo\ncould be saying that while \u201ccareless and stupid\u201d observers\nare struck by purpose, intention, and design in the universe, careful,\ncritical, intelligent ones are not. But there is no need to force the\nirony here. Read straight, nature\u2019s \u201ccontrivance and\nartifice\u201d is \u201cinexplicable\u201d precisely because reason\ncan discover nothing about God\u2019s natural or moral attributes.\nEveryone\u2014even the stupid and careless\u2014can see that the\nparts of animals and plants have functions, and so can easily\nunderstand why \u201can anatomist, who discovered a new organ or\ncanal, would never be satisfied until he had also discovered its use\nand intention\u201d (DCNR 12.2/90).\n\nRecognizing that an organism\u2019s parts have\nuses\u2014functions\u2014says nothing about\nwhether their uses or functions are due to a designer\u2019s plan, so\nPhilo\u2019s acknowledgement implies nothing about whether he now\naccepts the design hypothesis. In fact, what he says here reiterates\nhis position in Part 8, that function alone is no proof of divine\ndesign:\n\n\nit is in vain \u2026 to insist on the uses of the parts of animals\nor vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain\nknow how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?\n(DCNR 8.9/61)\n\n\nNo one should deny design in this sense, so long as they do\nso \u201cwithout any religious purpose\u201d (DCNR 12.2/90). Far\nfrom reversing himself, then, Philo\u2019s position is continuous\nwith the line he has taken throughout the Dialogues.\n\nAs the conversation continues, Philo provides a diagnosis of the\ndispute. While the works of nature do bear \u201ca great\nanalogy\u201d to the products of human artifice, as its proponents\nclaim, there are also considerable differences. He suspects that this\nmay be the source of the intractability of the controversy, which\nsuggests that it may be at bottom \u201csomewhat of a dispute of\nwords\u201d (DCNR 12.6/92).\n\nBut verbal disputes can be resolved\u2014or\ndissolved\u2014by providing clear definitions. However, the\ndilemma about the content of our idea of God that Philo has\nconstructed clearly implies that such a constructive solution\nis not possible here.\n\nPhilo explains why only a critical solution is possible by\noffering a deeper diagnosis of the problem. Although the dispute may\nappear to be merely verbal, it is in fact \u201cstill more incurably\nambiguous\u201d, for\n\n\nthere is a species of controversy, which, from the very nature of\nlanguage and of human ideas, is involved in perpetual ambiguity, and\ncan never, by any precaution or any definitions, be able to reach a\nreasonable certainty or precision. These are the controversies\nconcerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance. (DCNR\n12.7/92)\n\n\nThis is exactly what the dispute over intelligent design is about.\nAnalogies are always matters of degree, and the degrees of the\nqualities involved in the design argument aren\u2019t capable of\nexact measurement. The controversy thus \u201cadmits not of any\nprecise meaning, nor consequently of any determination\u201d (DCNR\n12.7/93). The dispute about design is actually worse than a\nverbal dispute.\n\nThat is why anyone, even an atheist, can say, with equal plausibility,\nthat \u201cthe rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and\nthe structure of human thought\u201d all \u201cprobably bear some\nremote analogy to each other\u201d (DCNR 12.7/93). That is why Philo,\nwithout renouncing any of his previous claims, can assent to the\n\u201csomewhat ambiguous, at least undefined\u201d, and, as we have\nseen, indefinable proposition into which\n\n\nthe whole of natural theology \u2026 resolves itself \u2026\nthat the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear\nsome remote analogy to human intelligence. (DCNR 12.33/101)\n\n\nAnything is like anything else in some remote respect. So the\nordering principle of the universe, if indeed there is one, can be\nabsolutely anything.\n\nIf this is all there is to \u201cthe whole of natural\ntheology\u201d, then we can certainly conclude that the\nargument\u2019s conclusion has no religiously significant content.\nBut it has no religiously significant content because Philo\u2019s\ncritique has drained it of any content whatsoever. Cleanthes\u2019\ndesign hypothesis is not just false; it is unintelligible.\n\nThe conversation began with all three participants agreeing that their\ntopic was to discuss only God\u2019s nature, not his\nexistence. As it concludes, it is no longer clear that these\nquestions are really so distinct as originally assumed. We don\u2019t\nknow what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about a God whose\nnature is inconceivable, incomprehensible, indeterminate, and\nindefinable. What, then, are we to make of the claim about his\nexistence?\n\nThe Dialogues draw out the consequences of Hume\u2019s\nstatement, in the first Enquiry, that\n\n\nthe idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good\nBeing, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and\naugmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom.\n(EHU 2.6/19)\n\n\nIf we insist on \u201caugmenting without limit\u201d, we let loose\nthe moorings that give intelligible content to God\u2019s\nintelligence, wisdom, and goodness. If we stop short of the limit, we\nmay have content, but we have also lost God.\n",
