    "main_text": "\n\n\nLawyers are typically interested in the question: What is the\nlaw on a particular issue? This is always a local question and\nanswers to it are bound to differ according to the specific\njurisdiction in which they are asked. In contrast, philosophy of law\nis interested in the general question: What is Law? This general\nquestion about the nature of law presupposes that law is a unique\nsocial-political phenomenon, with more or less universal\ncharacteristics that can be discerned through philosophical\nanalysis. General jurisprudence, as this philosophical inquiry about\nthe nature of law is called, is meant to be universal. It assumes that\nlaw possesses certain features, and it possesses them by its very\nnature, or essence, as law, whenever and wherever it happens to\nexist. However, even if there are such universal characteristics of\nlaw\u2014which is controversial, as we will later discuss\u2014the\nreasons for a philosophical interest in elucidating them remain to be\nexplained. First, there is the sheer intellectual interest in\nunderstanding such a complex social phenomenon which is, after all,\none of the most intricate aspects of human culture. Law, however, is\nalso a normative social practice: it purports to guide human behavior,\ngiving rise to reasons for action. An attempt to explain this\nnormative, reason-giving aspect of law is one of the main challenges\nof general jurisprudence. These two sources of interest in the nature\nof law are closely linked. Law is not the only normative domain in our\nculture; morality, religion, social conventions, etiquette, and so on,\nalso guide human conduct in many ways which are similar to\nlaw. Therefore, part of what is involved in the understanding of the\nnature of law consists in an explanation of how law differs from these\nsimilar normative domains, how it interacts with them, and whether its\nintelligibility depends on other normative orders, like morality or\nsocial conventions.\n\n\nContemporary legal theories define these two main interests in the\nnature of law in the following terms. First, we need to understand the\ngeneral conditions that would render any putative norm legally valid.\nIs it, for example, just a matter of the source of the norm, such as\nits enactment by a particular political institution, or is it also a\nmatter of the norm\u2019s content? This is the general question about the\nconditions of legal validity. Second, there is the interest in the\nnormative aspect of law. This philosophical interest is twofold: A\ncomplete philosophical account of the normativity of law comprises both\nan explanatory and a justificatory task. The explanatory task consists\nof an attempt to explain how legal norms can give rise to reasons for\naction, and what kinds of reasons are involved. The task of\njustification concerns the question of whether people ought to\ncomply\u2014morally speaking or all things considered\u2014with law\u2019s\ndemands. In other words, it is the attempt to explain the moral\nlegitimacy of law and the subjects\u2019 reasons for complying with it. A\ntheory about the nature of law, as opposed to critical theories of law,\nconcentrates on the first of these two questions. It purports to\nexplain what the normativity of law actually consists in. Some\ncontemporary legal philosophers, however, doubt that these two aspects\nof the normativity of law can be separated. (We will return to this\nlater.)\n\n\nThus, elucidating the conditions of legal validity and explaining\nthe normativity of law form the two main subjects of any general theory\nabout the nature of law. In section 1, we will explain some of\nthe main debates about these two issues. In section 2, we will\ndiscuss some of the methodological debates about the nature of general\njurisprudence. In the course of the last few centuries, two main rival\nphilosophical traditions have emerged about the nature of legality. The\nolder one, dating back to late mediaeval Christian scholarship, is\ncalled the\n natural law\ntradition. Since the early 19th century, natural law theories have been\nfiercely challenged by the\n legal positivism\ntradition promulgated by such scholars as\n Jeremy Bentham\nand\n John Austin.\nThe philosophical\norigins of legal positivism are much earlier, though, probably in the\n political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes.\nThe main controversy between these two traditions concerns the\nconditions of legal validity.  Basically, legal positivism asserts,\nand natural law denies, that the conditions of legal validity are\npurely a matter of social facts. In contrast to positivism, natural\nlaw claims that the conditions of legal validity are not exhausted by\nsocial facts; the moral content of the putative norms also bears on\ntheir legal validity. As the famous dictum, commonly attributed to\nSaint Augustine, has it: lex iniusta non est lex (unjust law\nis not law). (Augustine, De Libero Arbitrio, I, 5; see also Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, I-II, Q. 96, Art. 4.)\n\n",
