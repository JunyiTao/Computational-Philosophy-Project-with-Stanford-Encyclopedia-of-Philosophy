    "main_text": "Varieties of Civic Humanism || Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n3.4 Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n\nMachiavelli (1469\u20131527) is doubtless the best known of all the\nauthors discussed here on account of his Il principe\n(Prince; c. 1513\u20131514) and (to a lesser extent)\nDiscorsi (Discourses; c. 1514\u20131519). The\nformer is a somewhat notorious advice-book for rulers who wish to gain\nand hold power; the latter evaluates the strengths of a republican\nsystem of government. Machiavelli was deeply involved in governing the\nrepublic of Florence, serving in several important official\ncapacities, until a 1512 coup against the regime engineered by the\nMedici family cost him his position. Less often recognized is that he\nwrote prolifically\u2014poetry, plays, histories, military\nmanuals\u2014and left us with a large collection of correspondence\nand dispatches from his diplomatic activities (Nederman 2023).\nScholars from many viewpoints, judge Machiavelli to be the epitome of\ncivic humanist republicanism during the later Italian Renaissance\n(Najemy 1996). The academic literature on Machiavelli\u2019s thought\nis immense. Any serious attempt to summarize it is a fool\u2019s\nerrand.\n\nStated simply, Machiavelli encapsulates the multiple forms of civic\nhumanism that have been examined. On the one hand, the\nDiscorsi is said to epitomize the republican ideals of\nself-governance and active citizenship commonly associated with the\nessence of civic humanism. (As mentioned in the Introduction,\nMachiavelli is one of the primary historical figures to whom\ncontemporary republican philosophers look for ideas and inspiration.)\nOn the other hand, Il principe exemplifies the tendency of\nsome civic humanists who have been considered above to look toward\nmonarchic regimes as the preferable form of rule. A plethora of\nscholarly effort has been directed toward attempting to reconcile\nthese two evidently very contradictory positions. Some interpreters\nsuggest, for instance, that the Discorsi represents his\n\u201creal\u201d views, and that Il principe is a satire or\nan attempt to win back his job in the Florentine government or to\nreveal to his fellow citizens the \u201creal\u201d inner workings of\nprincely regimes. Others propose that Il principe reflects\nMachiavelli\u2019s true teachings and that the principles ascribed to\nthe Discorsi are little more than extensions of his earlier\ntract. And some simply assert that no accord is possible.\n\nIt should be obvious, then, that the characteristics of the civic\nhumanist propensities ascribed by scholars to Machiavelli may be\nunderstood in a vast number of ways. Given the diversity of\ninterpretations, it is perhaps of greater utility to identify a single\ncentral theme shared by Il principe and the Discorsi\nand various civic humanists already discussed. Specifically,\nMachiavelli, like prior Florentine humanists, confronted in his\nwritings the quarrels that arose from conflicts between contending\nsets of interests, whether classes or political entities. All of the\nauthors previously addressed praised their favored form of government\n(republic, monarchy, empire) on the grounds that it introduced harmony\nand peace between clashing groups.\n\nIn both of his works, Machiavelli acknowledges the existence within\nevery community of two inherently incompatible classes: the\ngrandi (nobles) and the popolo (masses). The nobles\nseek to dominate those beneath them; the masses desire only to be free\nfrom domination. He clearly believes that these two parties can never\nbe brought together in a peaceful fashion. Their interests are simply\nincommensurable. So, Machiavelli\u2019s dilemma is how to avoid the\nnobles and the masses from warring against one another. He provides\ntwo possibilities. In Il principe, he remarks that a prince\nwho wishes to maintain his power must curb the aspirations of the\nnobility, to the extent that a ruler may reasonably consider\ncold-blooded murder as one of his tools. The people, by contrast,\nshould be treated mildly. Indeed, Machiavelli insists that if a prince\nmust choose to side with one or the other class, he should always take\nup the cause of the masses. Why? First, because their numbers are so\nmuch greater than those of the nobles that they are bound to prevail.\nSecond, because the popolo are so distant from the machinery\nof government headed by the prince that they are unable to observe the\nsometimes vicious means by which he must rule. Third, because they,\nbeing uneducated, are easily led by appearances and are unable to\napprehend the truth that the prince seeks to conceal.\n\nThe Discorsi treats class conflict in an entirely different\nway, namely, as a positive or productive feature of a well-developed\nrepublican system. Machiavelli\u2019s epitome of an ideal republic is\nancient Rome, in which tumult was rife. According to him, by\npermitting rather than suppressing the collision between these two\nsets of interests, Rome succeeded in actualizing and maintaining the\nparamount value of liberty. In a republic of the Roman sort, the\nnobility (via the Senate) has the main responsibility for governing,\nbut the people check that power by means of countervailing offices\n(such as the tribunes) and popular dissent. The struggle between them\nactually generates the liberty of the whole, both in terms of\nself-government unbeholden to either external forces or to tyranny and\nby assuring that the people\u2019s desire not to be dominated is\nachieved.\n\nMachiavelli recognizes that he is adopting an unusual perspective,\nsince customarily the blame for the collapse of the Roman Republic has\nbeen assigned to warring factions that eventually ripped it apart. By\ncontrast, he insists that precisely those conflicts generated a\n\u201ccreative tension\u201d that was the source of Roman liberty.\nOther republican models (such as those adopted by Sparta or Venice)\nproduced weaker political systems, ones that are either stagnant or\nprone to decay when circumstances change. The ultimate sign of the\nunique greatness of the Roman Republic is its conquest of huge amounts\nof territory, as a result of the grandi and the\npopolo setting aside their ultimately interminable struggles\n(at least for a time) in order to cooperate in the subjugation and\nexploitation of vast lands. Class struggle is thus socialized and put\nto effective use. It has been suggested, and with good reason, that a\nsignal element of Machiavelli\u2019s political project was to promote\nFlorence as the new Rome that will impose its domination over the rest\nof Italy. It is perhaps not too great a stretch to call him a civic\nhumanist with imperialistic pretensions (H\u00f6rnqvist 2004).\n",
