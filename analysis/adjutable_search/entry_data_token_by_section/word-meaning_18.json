    "main_text": "Cognitive Science || Cognitive Linguistics\n5.1 Cognitive Linguistics\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Eleanor Rosch put forth a new theory of\nthe mental representation of categories. Concepts such as furniture\nor bird,\nshe claimed, are not\nrepresented just as sets of criterial features with clear-cut\nboundaries, so that an item can be conceived as falling or not falling\nunder the concept based on whether or not it meets the relevant\ncriteria. Rather, items within categories can be considered more or\nless representative of the category itself (Rosch 1975; Rosch &\nMervis 1975; Mervis & Rosch 1981). Several experiments seemed to\nshow that the application of concepts is no simple yes-or-no business:\nsome items (the \u201cgood examples\u201d) are more easily\nidentified as falling under a concept than others (the \u201cpoor\nexamples\u201d). An automobile is perceived as a better example of\nvehicle than a rowboat,\nand much better than an elevator; a carrot is more readily identified\nas an example of the concept vegetable\nthan a pumpkin. If the concepts speakers\nassociate to category words (such as \u2018vehicle\u2019 and\n\u2018vegetable\u2019) were mere bundles of criterial features,\nthese preferences would be inexplicable, since they rank items that\nmeet the criteria equally well. It is thus plausible to assume that\nthe concepts associated to category words are have a center-periphery\narchitecture centered on the most representative examples of the\ncategory: a robin is perceived as a more \u201cbirdish\u201d bird\nthan an ostrich or, as people would say, closer to the\nprototype of a bird or to the prototypical bird (see\nthe entry on\n concepts).\n\nAlthough nothing in Rosch\u2019s experiments licensed the conclusion\nthat prototypical rankings should be reified and treated as the\ncontent of concepts (what her experiments did support was merely that\na theory of the mental representation of categories should be\nconsistent with the existence of prototype effects), the\nstudy of prototypes revolutionized the existing approaches to category\nconcepts (Murphy 2002) and was a leading force behind the birth of\ncognitive linguistics. Prototypes were central to the development of\nthe Radial Network Theory of Brugman (1988 [1981]) and Lakoff (Brugman\n& Lakoff 1988), which proposed to model the sense network of words\nby introducing in the architecture of word meanings the\ncenter-periphery relation at the heart of Rosch\u2019s seminal work.\nAccording to Brugman, word meanings can typically be modeled as radial\ncomplexes where a dominant sense is related to less typical senses by\nmeans of semantic relations such as metaphor and metonymy. For\nexample, the sense network of \u2018fruit\u2019 features product\nof plant growth at\nits center and a more abstract outcome\nat its periphery, and the two are\nconnected by a metaphorical relation). On a similar note, the\nConceptual Metaphor Theory of Lakoff & Johnson (1980; Lakoff 1987)\nand the Mental Spaces Approach of Fauconnier (1994; Fauconnier &\nTurner 1998) combined the assumption that word meanings typically have\nan internal structure arranging multiple related senses in a radial\nfashion, with the further claim that our use of words is governed by\nhard-wired mapping mechanisms that catalyze the integration of word\nmeanings across conceptual domains. For example, it is in virtue of\nthese mechanisms that the expressions \u201clove is war\u201d,\n\u201clife is a journey\u201d) are so widespread across cultures and\nsound so natural to our ears. On the proposed view, these associations\nare creative, perceptually grounded, systematic, cross-culturally\nuniform, and grounded on pre-linguistic patterns of conceptual\nactivity which correlate with core elements of human embodied\nexperience (see the entries on\n metaphor\n and\n embodied cognition).\n More in K\u00f6vecses (2002), Gibbs (2008), and Dancygier &\nSweetser (2014).\n\nAnother major innovation introduced by cognitive linguistics is the\ndevelopment of a resolutely \u201cencyclopedic\u201d approach to\nword meaning, best exemplified by Frame Semantics (Fillmore 1975,\n1982) and by the Theory of Domains (Langacker 1987). Approximating a\nbit, an approach to word meaning can be defined\n\u201cencyclopedic\u201d insofar as it characterizes knowledge of\nworldly facts as the primary constitutive force of word meaning. While\nthe Mental Spaces Approach and Conceptual Metaphor Theory regarded\nword meaning mainly as the product of associative patterns between\nconcepts, Fillmore and Langacker turned their attention to the\nrelation between word meaning and the body of encyclopedic knowledge\npossessed by typical speakers. Our ability to use and interpret the\nverb \u2018buy\u2019, for example, is closely intertwined with our\nbackground knowledge of the social nature of commercial transfer,\nwhich involves a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between\nthe money and the goods, and so forth. However, knowledge structures\nof this kind cannot be modeled as standard concept-like\nrepresentations. Here is how Frame Semantics attempts to meet the\nchallenge. First, words are construed as pairs of phonographic forms\nwith highly schematic concepts which are internally organized as\nradial categories and function as access sites to encyclopedic\nknowledge. Second, an account of the representational organization of\nencyclopedic knowledge is provided. According to Fillmore,\nencyclopedic knowledge is represented in long-term memory in the form\nof frames, i.e., schematic conceptual scenarios that specify\nthe prototypical features and functions of a denotatum, along with its\ninteractions with the objects and the events typically associated with\nit. Frames provide thus a schematic representation of the elements and\nentities associated with a particular domain of experience and convey\nthe information required to use and interpret the words employed to\ntalk about it. For example, according to Fillmore & Atkins (1992)\nthe use of the verb \u2018bet\u2019 is governed by the risk\nframe, which is as\nfollows:\n\n\n\nProtagonist:\n The central agent in the frame.\n\nBad:\n The possible bad outcome.\n\nDecision:\n The decision that could trigger the bad outcome.\n\nGoal:\n The desired outcome.\n\nSetting:\n The situation within which the risk exists.\n\nPossession:\n Something valued by the protagonist and endangered in the\nsituation.\n\nSource:\n Something or someone which could cause the harm.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein as Frame Semantics (more on the parallels in Clausner\n& Croft 1999), Langacker\u2019s Theory of Domains argues that our\nunderstanding of word meaning depends on our access to larger\nknowledge structures called domains. To illustrate the notion\nof a domain, consider the word \u2018diameter\u2019. The meaning of\nthis word cannot be grasped independently of a prior understanding of\nthe notion of a circle. According to Langacker, word meaning is\nprecisely a matter of \u201cprofile-domain\u201d organization: the\nprofile corresponds to a substructural element designated within a\nrelevant macrostructure, whereas the domain corresponds to the\nmacrostructure providing the background information against which the\nprofile can be interpreted (Taylor 2002). In the diameter/circle\nexample, \u2018diameter\u2019 designates a profile in the circle\ndomain. Similarly,\nexpressions like \u2018hot\u2019, \u2018cold\u2019, and\n\u2018warm\u2019 designate properties in the temperature\ndomain. Langacker\nargues that domains are typically structured into hierarchies that\nreflect meronymic relations and provide a basic conceptual ontology\nfor language use. For example, the meaning of \u2018elbow\u2019 is\nunderstood with respect to the arm\ndomain, while the meaning of \u2018arm\u2019\nis situated within the body\ndomain. Importantly, individual profiles\ntypically inhere to different domains, and this is one of the factors\nresponsible for the ubiquity of polysemy in natural language. For\nexample, the profile associated to the word \u2018love\u2019 inheres\nboth to the domains of embodied experience and to the abstract domains\nof social activities such as marriage ceremonies.\n\nDevelopments of the approach to word meaning fostered by cognitive\nlinguistics include Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995), Embodied\nConstruction Grammar (Bergen & Chang 2005), Invited Inferencing\nTheory (Traugott & Dasher 2001), and LCCM Theory (Evans 2009). The\nnotion of a frame has become popular in cognitive psychology to model\nthe dynamics of ad hoc categorization (e.g., Barsalou 1983,\n1992, 1999; more in\n Section 5.2).\n General information about the study of word meaning in cognitive\nlinguistics can be found in Talmy (2000a,b), Croft & Cruse (2004),\nand Evans & Green (2006).\n",
