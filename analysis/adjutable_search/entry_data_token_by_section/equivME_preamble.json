    "main_text": "\n\nEinstein correctly described the equivalence of mass and energy as\n\u201cthe most important upshot of the special theory of\nrelativity\u201d (Einstein 1919), for this result lies at the core of\nmodern physics. Many commentators have observed that in\nEinstein\u2019s first derivation of this famous result, he did not\nexpress it with the equation \\(E = mc^2\\). Instead, Einstein concluded\nthat if an object, which is at rest relative to an inertial frame,\neither absorbs or emits an amount of energy \\(L\\), its inertial mass\nwill correspondingly either increase or decrease by an amount\n\\(L/c^2\\). In Newtonian physics, inertial mass is construed as an\nintrinsic property of an object that measures the extent to which an\nobject resists changes to its state of motion. So, Einstein\u2019s\nconclusion that the inertial mass of an object changes if the object\nabsorbs or emits energy was revolutionary and transformative. For as\nEinstein concluded \u201cIf the theory agrees with the facts, then\nradiation transmits inertia between emitting and absorbing\nbodies\u201d (Einstein, 1905b). Yet, in Newtonian physics, inertia is\nnot the kind of thing that can be transmitted between bodies. \n\nOver a century after Einstein\u2019s first derivation of mass-energy\nequivalence, as his famous result is called because one can select\nunits in which one can express it with an equation of the form \\(E =\nm\\), the result continues to receive outstanding empirical support.\nFurthermore, as the physicist Wolfgang Rindler has pointed out, the\nresult \u201chas been found applicable and valid in many branches of\nphysics, from electromagnetism to general relativity\u201d (Rindler\n1991, p. 74). Thus, from Rindler\u2019s perspective, which is shared\nby many physicists, mass-energy equivalence \u201c\u2026 is truly a new\nfundamental principle of physics\u201d (Rindler 1991, p. 74). \n\nThe two main philosophical questions surrounding Einstein\u2019s\nequation, which are the focus of this entry, concern how we ought to\nunderstand the assertion that mass and energy are in some sense\nequivalent and how we ought to understand assertions\nconcerning the convertibility of mass into energy (or vice versa).\n\n\nThe equation \\(E = mc^2\\) is, arguably, the most famous equation in\n20th century physics. To appreciate what Einstein\u2019s\nfamous result is about, and what it is not about, we begin in Section\n1 with a description of the physics of mass-energy equivalence. In\nSection 2, we survey six distinct, though related, philosophical\ninterpretations of mass-energy equivalence. We then discuss, in\nSection 3, the history of derivations of mass-energy equivalence and\nits philosophical importance. Section 4 is a brief and selective\naccount of empirical confirmation of Einstein\u2019s result that\nfocuses on Cockcroft and Walton\u2019s (1932) first confirmation of\nmass-energy equivalence and a more recent, and very accurate,\nconfirmation by Rainville et al. (2005). \n",
