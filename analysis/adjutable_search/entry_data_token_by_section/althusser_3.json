    "main_text": "Early Work (1946\u201360) || Hegelian Marxism\n2.2 Hegelian Marxism\n\nThe second category of Althusser\u2019s early work, one closely\nrelated to the first, are those texts that deal with Hegel. Written\nprimarily for an academic audience, they approach Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy either critically, in terms of the history of its reception\nand use, or exegetically, in terms of examining what possibility\nHegel\u2019s metaphysics, logic, politics, epistemology, and\nunderstanding of subjectivity offer to those interested in\nunderstanding and encouraging societal transformation. Between 1946\nand 1950, the results of Althusser\u2019s exegeses were positive:\nHegel indeed had something to offer. This judgment finds its most\ndetailed explanation in Althusser\u2019s 1947 thesis \u201cOn\nContent in the thought of G.W.F. Hegel.\u201d In addition to\ndetailing Hegel\u2019s relation to Kant and criticizing the\nsimplification of the dialectic by Hegel\u2019s commentators,\nAlthusser argues in this work that the dialectic \u201ccannot be\nattacked for its form\u201d (1947, 116). Instead, Hegel can only be\ncritiqued for a failure of the contents of the form (as these contents\nare specified in Hegel\u2019s historical and political works) to have\nactually fulfilled the absolute idea. Following the Young Hegelians,\nthen, Althusser uses Hegel\u2019s dialectic against itself to\ncriticize claims like the one made in The Philosophy of Right\nthat the Prussian state is the fulfillment of the dialectic. Though he\nuses Marx\u2019s Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of\nRight to make his points and though he is in agreement with Marx\nthat the Hegelian concept, realized in thought, must now be realized\nin the world, Althusser does not suggest in his thesis that\nMarx\u2019s philosophy leaves Hegel\u2019s insights about, history,\nlogic, and the subject behind. Instead, he contends that Marx is\nguilty of committing the same error as Hegel in mistaking historical\ncontent for the fulfillment of the dialectic. Because all knowledge is\nhistorical, Althusser argues, Marxists can only correct for this error\nby appeal to the idea of the dialectic and to its end in the absolute\nand the eternal, to a time \u201cwhen the human totality will be\nreconciled with its own structure\u201d (1947, 156). Something like\nthis argument will appear again in his classical work as a critique of\nthe empiricist tendency in Marxist philosophy.\n",
