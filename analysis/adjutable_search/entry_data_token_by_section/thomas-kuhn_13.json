Paul Hoyningen-Huene (1989/1993), as a result of working\nwith Kuhn, developed an important neo-Kantian interpretation of his\ndiscussion of perception and world-change. We may distinguish between\nthe world-in-itself and the \u2018world\u2019 of our perceptual and\nrelated experiences (the phenomenal world). This corresponds to the\nKantian distinction between noumena and phenomena. The important\ndifference between Kant and Kuhn is that Kuhn takes the general form\nof phenomena not to be fixed but changeable. A shift in paradigm can\nlead, via the theory-dependence of observation, to a difference in\none\u2019s experiences of things and thus to a change in one\u2019s phenomenal\nworld.  This change in phenomenal world articulates the sense in which\nthe world changes as a result of a scientific revolution while also\ncapturing Kuhn\u2019s claims about the theory-dependence of observation and\nconsequent incommensurability (Hoyningen-Huene 1990).\nA rather different direction in which Kuhn\u2019s thought has been\ndeveloped proposes that his ideas might be illuminated by advances in\ncognitive psychology. One the one hand work on conceptual structures\ncan help understand what might be correct in the incommensurability\nthesis (Nersessian 1987, 2003). Several authors have sought in\ndifferent ways to emphasize what they take to be the Wittgensteinian\nelement in Kuhn\u2019s thought (for example Kindi 1995, Sharrock and Read\n2002). Andersen, Barker, and Chen (1996, 1998, 2006) draw in\nparticular on Kuhn\u2019s version of Wittgenstein\u2019s notion of family\nresemblance. Kuhn articulates a view according to which the extension\nof a concept is determined by similarity to a set of exemplary cases\nrather than by an intension. Andersen, Barker, and Chen argue that\nKuhn\u2019s view is supported by the work of Rosch (1972; Rosch and Mervis\n1975) on prototypes; furthermore, this approach can be developed in\nthe context of dynamic frames (Barsalou 1992), which can then\nexplain the phenomenon of (semantic) incommensurability.\nOn the other hand, the psychology of analogical thinking and\ncognitive habits may also inform our understanding of the concept of a\nparadigm. Kuhn himself tells us that \u201cThe paradigm as shared\nexample is the central element of what I now take to be the most novel\nand least understood aspect of [The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions]\u201d (1970a, 187). Kuhn, however, failed to\ndevelop the paradigm concept in his later work beyond an early\napplication of its semantic aspects to the explanation of\nincommensurability. Nonetheless, other philosophers, principally\nHoward Margolis (1987, 1993) have developed the idea that habits of\nmind formed by training with paradigms-as-exemplars are an important\ncomponent in understanding the nature of scientific development.  As\nexplained by Nickles (2003b) and Bird (2005), this is borne out by\nrecent work by psychologists on model-based and analogical thinking.\n",
