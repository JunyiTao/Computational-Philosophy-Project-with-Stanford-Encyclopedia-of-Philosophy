    "main_text": "E-Languages versus I-Languages || First Response to the I-language Perspective: No Representations Without Representeds\n3.2 First Response to the I-language Perspective: No Representations Without Representeds\n\nCriticisms of Chomsky\u2019s internalism, and so by implication his\nnotion of an I-language, stretch back over half a century, as do his\nresponses. Three collections (George 1989; McGilvray 1999; Antony and\nHornstein 2003) between them contain a full array of philosophical\ncommentary. In this and the next section we focus on concerns that\nhave particular currency.\n\nMany critics have focused on an unacknowledged commitment to\nexternalism that they think is implicit in Chomsky\u2019s\nterminology. The charge can be made using any of the different\nphrasings he has used to express his internalism, including\ncompetence, knowledge, and representation.\nFor the first: competence implies competence in something.\nFor that something to be defined in terms of the language faculty\nitself, there would be no such thing as incompetence, making a\nnonsense of talk of competence. Error would be impossible (see Barber\n2001). For the second: knowledge implies something known\u2014an\nexternal language or some subset of its properties. Chomsky has\ndescribed these criticisms as arising from a misinterpretation of his\nview, and said that he was using competence and knowledge in a\ntechnical sense rather than in full accordance with ordinary usage. He\nhas occasionally suggested \u201ccognize\u201d as an alternative\nterm of art to prevent confusion, where to cognize an I-language is\nfor it to be represented in one\u2019s language\n faculty.[5]\n Recent iterations of the criticism have thus tended to focus on\nrepresentation. It seems that there can be no representing without\nsomething\u2019s being represented\u2014something external to the\nthing doing the representating, and so external to the language\nfaculty or even the individual. Chomsky\u2019s response has been to\nsay that he is not using representation in a relation sense,\nrepresentation of (1995a: 53 and in Antony and\nHornstein 2003: 276\u20137).\n\nThe notion of representation is central to a good deal of cognitive\nscience and is a topic that has preoccupied many philosophers of mind\nand language who share Chomsky\u2019s naturalistic bent. Many of the\nlatter have been surprised and puzzled by his rejection of both the\nrelational notion of representation (where the relation is between\nvehicles of representation in the mind/brain, and the things they\nrepresent) and attempts to define this relation in naturalistic\nlanguage (see\n causal theories of mental content,\n intentionality, and\n mental representation).\n Georges Rey, for example, sees the intentionality, the\n\u201caboutness\u201d, implicit in the notion of representation as\nessential to the computational-representational theory of\nmind\u2014precisely the theory that he and others think\nChomsky\u2019s work has helped to inspire and shape (Rey 2003a,b\n& 2005). Rey concludes that Chomsky is mistaken about the status\nhis own theory, and offers instead what he thinks is a more charitable\ninterpretation: that the representations are of something, but\ntypically inaccurate and harmlessly so.\n\nIn the earlier presentation\n (3.1.1)\n we tried to capture Chomsky\u2019s arelational notion of\nrepresentation, where to describe something as representating an\nI-language is simply a way of describing it abstractly. John Collins\nhas gone to greater lengths to make good this suggestion that there\ncould be representations without representata (2014). Adopting \u201cdyadic\nrepresentational talk\u201d helps us to \u201cframe generalizations\nabout monadic representational states\u201d, he says. Representata\nare no more than the byproducts of a grammarians\u2019 attempt to\ntype non-relational states the mind/brain can be in or pass through.\nInvoking them does not generate any ontological commitment to\nlanguages external to the mind/brain being described.\n\nFrances Egan has taken a view that appears to capture the spirit of\nChomsky\u2019s attitude to representation while also making room (and\nseeing the need) for a relational notion of representational content\nin cognitive explanation (generally, and in linguistics in\nparticular). According to Egan (2003, 2014), representational\ncontent\u2014the dyadic notion, that is\u2014figures in cognitive\nexplanation, but not in the way orthodoxy would have it. The internal\ncomputational mechanism alone, uninterpreted, does the explaining.\nThat this mechanism has the representational content it does figures\nonly within the explanans. It is used to specify the explanandum.\nThis explanandum, and hence any allocation to it of content, will\noften be quite vaguely characterized, and may even fail to correspond\nto anything real.\n\n\nBecause the mechanism, as computationally characterized, would not\ntrack these [external] properties in every environment, the semantic\ninterpretation of the device is not an essential characterization, and\ncannot serve to individuate it. However, the semantic interpretation\nenables us to specify the cognitive function of the mechanism, to\ncharacterize it as computing [visual] depth from disparity, for\nexample, or as computing the syntactic structure of a sentence. (Egan\n2014: 98)\n\n\nThis is arguably in the same spirit as Chomsky\u2019s description of\nthe language faculty as \u201cproviding instructions\u201d to\nperformance systems (1995b: 15). Representations in the language\nfaculty corresponding to elements of a grammar such as [voiced coronal\nsibilant], for example, do not stand for movements of the mouth (such\nas the one produced at the beginning of an utterance of the English\nword zebra), but they might nonetheless be part of the causal\nstory of why a human moves her or his mouth in a particular way in\nparticular circumstances.\n\nMany of those engaged in this debate focus on cases such as the edges\nin Kaniza\u2019s triange illusion (figure 1) or PRO (a sytanctic\nconstituent to which nothing corresponds in the sound-stream). The nub\nof the issue, here, seems to be what to make of the fact that there is\nno edge, or no syntactic constituent, beyond the edge or syntactic\nconstituent represented in our mind-brain. The same might even hold of\nthe notion of a common language. What we make of this for the nature\nof cognitive explanation, and of the notion of representation that so\ntypically figures within it, is yet to be settled, and goes to the\nvery heart of the philosophy of cognitive science.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.
