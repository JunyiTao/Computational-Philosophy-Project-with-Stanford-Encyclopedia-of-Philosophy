Loch,\nin their work with the Charity Organisation Society (COS). This led to\na lifelong association with the COS\u2014one with which Bosanquet was\nindelibly connected. He was a Member of Council of the COS from 1898\nuntil his death, serving as Vice Chairman (1901\u20131915) and as\nChairman (1916\u20131917). He also served on Administration and\nDistrict Committees of the COS and was involved in the operation (and,\nfrom 1908\u20131912, served as Chairman of the Executive Council) of\nthe COS-sponsored School of Sociology and Social Economics from 1903\nuntil its incorporation into the London School of Economics in 1912.\n\n\nFor Bosanquet, social work needed to be connected with education and,\nby extension, educational reform. Through his cousin Mary C. McCallum,\nBosanquet learned about the Home Arts and Industries Association and\nits role in practical education and, starting in 1891, he frequently\nlectured and taught university extension courses for the London\nEthical Society (LES)\u2014initially under auspices of the University\nExtension Scheme at Essex Hall\u2014and its successor, the\nshort-lived London School of Ethics and Social Philosophy\n(1897\u20131900). Many of his publications, including The\nEssentials of Logic, A Companion to Plato\u2019s Republic\nfor English Readers, Psychology of the Moral Self, and\nThe Philosophical Theory of the State, were based on or were\nprepared as texts for these courses.\n\nBosanquet\u2019s lectures and essays on social topics deal not only\nwith general concerns on the role of social institutions and the state\nin promoting the good life, but on specific questions dealing with\nsocial reform. Many of these essays were published in the Charity\nOrganisation Review, but several were of a broad interest and\nappeared in leading philosophical and sociological journals and books.\nIn Essays and Addresses (1889), Bosanquet advances an\n\u201cideal of modern life\u201d which he calls \u201cChristian\nHellenism\u201d. There, in an essay entitled \u201cThe Kingdom of\nGod on Earth\u201d, he gives an analysis of the relation between the\nhuman individual and the community that was taken up later in his\npolitical philosophy. \n\nParticularly because of his COS work, Bosanquet was familiar with the\nempirical data on what was called \u201cthe social problem\u201d,\nand he made extensive concrete proposals for social reform; one finds\nexamples of this in \u201cIn Darkest England\u201d On the Wrong\nTrack (1891), his discussion and critique of Salvation Army\nGeneral William Booth\u2019s programme for the alleviation of\npauperism, and in Aspects of the Social Problem (1895), a\ncollection of essays which he edited and to which he contributed six\nof the 18 chapters. Bosanquet believed, however, that the key to\nsocial progress was the development of individual character. It was\nthis focus on character rather than social conditions that brought his\nviews into conflict with a number of reformers, including the Fabian\nsocial radicals, Sidney and Beatrice Webb. In particular, it led to\nthe accusation that Bosanquet\u2019s views were too individualistic\nand out of touch with the root of the problem of poverty (see Hobhouse\n1918: 78\u201379). This disagreement came to a head during the\nsessions of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws on which both Helen\nBosanquet and Beatrice Webb served. Some commentators have noted that,\nwhen one examines their specific suggestions on practical policy, the\ndifferences between the Bosanquets and their opponents are more often\nover strategy than principle.\n\nFor Bosanquet, education was not simply the acquisition of knowledge,\nbut of values; his involvement in adult education was inspired both by\nhis interest in bringing advanced formal education to a larger\npopulation that had a more extensive life experience than the typical\nundergraduate, but also by his views on art in the development of\ncharacter. While an adequate education requires having some\nunderstanding of general principles, it also involves moral and\naesthetic values. In his early writings, but also in his later work,\nBosanquet is particularly concerned with how such values can be\ninculcated.\n\nIn his two early essays on \u201cArtistic Handiwork in\nEducation\u201d (1887), Bosanquet argued for some form of handicraft\nwork being introduced into elementary and secondary education. This,\nBosanquet wrote, can contribute to the awakening, the enjoyment, and\nthe appreciation of beauty in nature and in art. Handicraft that has a\ndistinctively artistic character requires not only exertion through\nthe exercise of active apprehension, but also \u201cseeing\ndeeply\u201d into nature. Moreover, the study of works of art\nprovides a key to understanding both the culture and character of\nother nations but also universal human values.\n\nSimilar views on education can be discerned in Bosanquet\u2019s\nThe Education of the Young in \u2018The Republic\u2019 of\nPlato (1900), in his remarks on \u201cHow Could the Ethical\nEfficiency of Education be Increased?\u201d (1908), and in essays in\nSome Suggestions in Ethics (1918). In Some Suggestions in\nEthics, for example, Bosanquet distinguishes between\n\u201cignorance\u201d and \u201cstupidity\u201d. Ignorance is the\nintellectual state of not knowing facts. But, more problematic for\nBosanquet, is stupidity\u2014the \u201cinability to see\u201d or\nthe blindness to values\u2014for it either distorts, or reflects a\ndistortion of, one\u2019s \u201cideas concerning facts, objects and\ntruths\u201d (op. cit., p. 236). For Bosanquet, then,\neducation should be primarily directed at improving character; it is\nthe remedy for \u201cawakening interests and proportioning them to\nvalues\u201d (op. cit., p. 237). This, however, requires\neducational reform in schools\u2014concerning the atmosphere or tone\nof the school, the personality of the teachers, and the organisation\nof work and play. Through the social activities involved in\nparticipation\u2014particularly of the young\u2014in the arts or in\nartistic training, Bosanquet believed that society can facilitate both\nthe appreciation of beauty and moral excellence. \n",
