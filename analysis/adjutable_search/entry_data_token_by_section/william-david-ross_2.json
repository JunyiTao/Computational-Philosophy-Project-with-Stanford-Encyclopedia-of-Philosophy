Ross\u2019s Rejection of Kant\u2019s Deontology and Ideal Utilitarianism\n\nRoss rejects Kantian deontology and ideal utilitarianism (his main\nopponent). Ross complains that each of his rivals\n\u2018over-simplifies the moral life\u2019 (FE 189). They fail to\ncapture at least some of the moral attitudes constituting the\nknowledge the philosopher neither proves nor disproves (RG\n20\u201321n1).\n\nKant over-simplifies the moral life in a number of ways. Ross thinks\nthe clearest case of oversimplification is Kant\u2019s commitment to\nexceptionless moral principles (RG 18\u201319; FE 313, 134, 173; KT 24,\n95). Kant maintains lying is always wrong (Kant 1785, 1797). It\ncannot, he says, serve as a universal law that one may lie to avoid\nsome difficulty or harm (either to oneself or to another). As soon as\nlying in such cases is such a law it is impossible to benefit by\nlying, for everyone will be wise to the fact people lie in such cases.\nRoss disagrees. In line with common sense, he thinks it is permissible\nto lie in some contexts (RG 28), e.g., when the (net) benefit of lying\nsignificantly outweighs the cost as would be true of a case in which\none lies to prevent a friend from being killed by a would-be murderer\ninquiring about one\u2019s friend\u2019s whereabouts (KT 31\u201332; for\nKant\u2019s discussion of the case of the inquiring murderer, see\nKant 1797). Ross holds the oversimplification results in part from\nKant thinking \u2018the rightness or wrongness of an individual act\ncan be inferred with certainty from its falling or not falling under a\nrule capable of being universalised\u2019 (FE 189; also KT 25).\nKant\u2019s abstract way of ethical reasoning involves neglecting\nfactors relevant to figuring out what we should do (KT 33\u201334; FE\n189).\n\nKant oversimplifies the moral life in another way. He says only the\nmotive to do what is morally required because it is morally required\npossesses moral worth (Kant 1785). Ross contends other\nmotives have moral worth, including \u2018direct devotion to another\nperson or other persons\u2019 (KT 3). Returning favours to loved ones\nbecause you love them and not because you think you ought has moral\nvalue. It is closer to common sense to think moral life is not a\n\u2018contest between one element which alone has worth [i.e., the\nmotive to do what is right because it is right] and a multitude of\nothers which have none; the truth rather is that it is a struggle\nbetween a multiplicity of desires having various degrees of\nworth\u2019 (FE 206; also KT 3, 18, 93).\n\nThe ideal utilitarians Hastings Rashdall and G. E. Moore maintain an\nindividual acts rightly in so far as their act produces at least as\nmuch surplus general good as any other act they could have performed\nin their situation (Moore 1903, 1912; Rashdall 1907, 1913; for\ndetailed discussion of ideal utilitarianism, see Skelton 2011, 2013b).\nRoss holds ideal utilitarians guilty of distorting or oversimplifying\nmoral life in a number of ways.\n\nFirst, the view assumes, he says, there is a \u2018general character\nwhich makes right acts right\u2019, that of maximising a plurality of\nintrinsic goods (RG 16). By presupposing there is only one basic or\nunderived obligation ideal utilitarianism distorts our understanding\nof moral deliberation. For example, when deciding whether to fulfil a\npromise we think much more of the fact that in the past we have made a\npromise than of the consequences its fulfilment promotes (RG 17; Ross\n1931, 68). Our common-sense moral thinking includes the idea that what\nwe ought to do depends in part on retrospective considerations, e.g.,\nthat we have made a promise in the past or previously incurred a\ndebt.\n\nSecond, the view says the only morally salient relation \u2018in\nwhich my neighbours stand to me is that of being possible\nbeneficiaries by my action\u2019 (RG 19; OJ 125). But we stand in\nrelations of all kinds to other people, including that of creditor to\ndebtor, child to parent and friend to friend, and they matter in\nthemselves to what we are permitted or ought to do. You ought, for\ninstance, to pay your debts before donating to charities even if\ngiving priority to your debts fails to maximise surplus value.\n\nRoss\u2019s moral theory reinvigorated select doctrines defended by\nthe eighteenth-century moralists Joseph Butler and (it seems) Richard\nPrice. Ross revived the anti-utilitarian arguments in Butler\u2019s\nA Dissertation of the Nature of Virtue (Butler 1736, 139\u2013140)\nand in Price\u2019s A Review of the Principal Questions in\nMorals (especially Price 1787, 79ff., 131\u2013176). H. A. Prichard\n(Prichard 1912, 1932) and Moore (Moore 1903, 1912) were Ross\u2019s\nmost important contemporary influences. Ross found Prichard\u2019s\ndefense of a plurality of moral obligations and of the complexity of\nmoral decision making alluring. Ross rejected Moore\u2019s\nutilitarianism, but he sympathised with Moore\u2019s methodology for\nsoliciting intuitions about goodness and with some of his views about\nintrinsic value and moral semantics. Finally, Ross could not help\nbeing influenced by Aristotle. He was in particular impressed with\nAristotle\u2019s methodology and his appeal to the many and the\nwise.\n",
