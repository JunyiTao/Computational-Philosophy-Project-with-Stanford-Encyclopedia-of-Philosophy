Similarly, one problem \\(X\\) is understood to be more complex (or harder) than another problem \\(Y\\) just in case \\(Y\\) possesses a more efficient decision algorithm than the most efficient algorithm for deciding \\(X\\). In order to make these definitions precise, a number of technical conventions are employed, many of which are borrowed from the adjacent fields of computability theory (e.g. Rogers 1987) and algorithmic analysis (e.g. Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest 2005). It will be useful to summarize these before proceeding further.\n\n\nA reference model of computation \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\) is chosen to represent algorithms. \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\) is assumed to be a reasonable model in the sense that it accurately reflects the computational costs of carrying out the sorts of informally specified algorithms which are encountered in mathematical practice. The deterministic Turing machine model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) is traditionally selected for this purpose. (See \n Section 2.2 \n for further discussion of reasonable models and the justification of this choice.)\n\nDecision problems are represented as sets consisting of objects which can serve as the inputs for a machine \\(M \\in \\mathfrak{M}\\). For instance, if \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\) is used as the reference model then it is assumed that all problems \\(X\\) are represented as sets of finite binary strings \u2013 i.e. \\(X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^*\\). This is accomplished by defining a mapping \\(\\ulcorner \\cdot \\urcorner:X \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^*\\) whose definition will depend on the type of objects which comprise \\(X\\). For instance, if \\(X \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}\\), then \\(\\ulcorner n \\urcorner\\) will typically be the binary numeral representing \\(n\\). And if \\(X\\) is a subset of \\(\\text{Form}_{\\mathcal{L}}\\) \u2013 i.e. the set of formulas over a formal language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) such as that of propositional logic \u2013 then \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) will typically be a (binary) G\u00f6del numeral for \\(\\phi\\). Based on these conventions, problems \\(X\\) will henceforth be identified with sets of strings \\(\\{\\ulcorner x \\urcorner : x \\in X\\} \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^*\\) (which are often referred to as languages) corresponding to their images under such an encoding.\n\nA machine \\(M\\) is said to decide a language \\(X\\) just in case \\(M\\) computes the characteristic function of \\(X\\) relative to the standard input-output conventions for the model \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\). For instance, a Turing machine \\(T\\)  decides \\(X\\) just in case for all \\(x \\in \\{0,1\\}^*\\), the result of applying \\(T\\) to \\(x\\) yields a halting computation ending in a designated accept state if \\(x \\in X\\) and a designated reject state if \\(x \\not\\in X\\). A function problem is that of computing the values of a given function \\(f:A \\rightarrow B\\). \\(M\\) is said to solve a function problem \\(f:A \\rightarrow B\\) just in case the mapping induced by its operation coincides with \\(f(x)\\) \u2013 i.e. if \\(M(x) = f(x)\\) for all \\(x \\in A\\) where \\(M(x)\\) denotes the result of applying machine \\(M\\) to input \\(x\\), again relative to the input-output conventions for the model \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\).\n\nFor each problem \\(X\\), it is also assumed that an appropriate notion of problem size is defined for its instances. Formally, this is a function \\(\\lvert\\cdot \\rvert: X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) chosen so that the efficiency of a decision algorithm for \\(X\\) will varying uniformly in \\(\\lvert x\\rvert\\). As we have seen, if \\(X \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}\\), it is standard to take \\(\\lvert n\\rvert = \\log_2(n)\\) \u2013 i.e. the number of digits (or length) of the binary numeral \\(\\ulcorner n \\urcorner\\) representing \\(n\\). Similarly if \\(X\\) is a class of logical formulas over a language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) (e.g. that or propositional or first-order logic), then \\(\\lvert\\phi\\rvert\\) will typically be a measure of \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s syntactic complexity (e.g. the number of propositional variables or clauses it contains). If \\(X\\) is a graph theoretic problem its instances will consist of the encodings of finite graphs of the form \\(G = \\langle V,E \\rangle\\) where \\(V\\) is a set of vertices and \\(E \\subseteq V \\times V\\) is a set of edges. In this case \\(\\lvert G\\rvert\\) will typically be a function of the cardinalities of the sets \\(V\\) and \\(E\\).\n\nThe efficiency of a machine \\(M\\) is measured in terms of its time complexity \u2013 i.e. the number of basic steps \\(time_M(x)\\) required for \\(M\\) to halt and return an output for the input \\(x\\) (where the precise notion of \u2018basic step\u2019 will vary with the model \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\)). This measure may be converted into a function of type \\(\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) by considering \\(t_{M}(n) = \\max \\{time_M(x) : \\lvert x\\rvert = n \\}\\) \u2013 i.e. the worst case time complexity of \\(M\\) defined as the maximum number of basic steps required for \\(M\\) to halt and return an output for all inputs \\(x\\) of size \\(n\\). The worst case space complexity of \\(M\\) \u2013 denoted \\(s_{M}(n)\\) \u2013 is defined similarly \u2013 i.e. the maximum number of tape cells (or other form of memory locations) visited or written to in the course of \\(M\\)\u2019s computation for all inputs of size \\(n\\).\n\nThe efficiency of two machines is compared according to the order of growth of their time and space complexities. In particular, given a function \\(f:\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\) we define its order of growth to be \\(O(f(n)) = \\{g(n) : \\exists c \\exists n_0 \\forall n \\geq n_0(g(n) \\lt c \\cdot f(n)) \\}\\) \u2013 i.e. the set of all functions which are asymptotically bounded  by \\(f(n)\\), ignoring scalar factors. For instance, for all fixed \\(k, c_1, c_2\\ \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) the following functions are all in \\(O(n^2)\\): the constant \\(k\\)-function, \\(\\log(n), n, c_1 \\cdot n^2 + c_2\\).  However \\(\\frac{1}{1000}n^3 \\not\\in O(n^2)\\). A machine \\(M_1\\) is said to have lower time complexity (or to run faster than) another machine \\(M_2\\) if \\(t_{M_1}(n) \\in O(t_{M_2}(n))\\), but not conversely. Space complexity comparisons between machines are performed similarly.\n\nThe time and space complexity of a problem \\(X\\) are measured in terms of the worst case time and space complexity of the asymptotically most efficient algorithm for deciding \\(X\\). In particular, we say that \\(X\\) has time complexity \\(O(t(n))\\) if the worst case time complexity of the most time efficient machine \\(M\\) deciding \\(X\\) is in \\(O(t(n))\\). Similarly, \\(Y\\) is said to be harder to decide (or more complex) than \\(X\\) if the time complexity of \\(X\\) is asymptotically bounded by the time complexity of \\(Y\\). The space complexity of a problem is defined similarly.\n\nA complexity class can now be defined to be the set of problems for which there exists a decision procedure with a given running time or running space complexity. For instance, the class \\(\\textbf{TIME}(f(n))\\) denotes the class of problems with time complexity \\(f(n)\\). \\(\\textbf{P}\\) \u2013 or polynomial time \u2013 is used to denote the union of the classes \\(\\textbf{TIME}(n^k)\\) for \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with respect to the reference model \\(\\mathfrak{T}\\). \\(\\textbf{P}\\) hence subsumes all problems for which there exists a decision algorithm which can be implemented by a Turing machine whose time complexity is of polynomial order of growth. \\(\\textbf{SPACE}(f(n))\\) and \\(\\textbf{PSPACE}\\) \u2013 or polynomial space \u2013 is defined similarly. Several other complexity classes we will consider below (e.g. \\(\\textbf{NP}\\), \\(\\textbf{BPP}\\), \\(\\textbf{BQP}\\)) are defined by changing the reference model of computation, the definition of what it means for a machine to accept or reject an input, or both.\n",
