    "main_text": "Anthropic Reasoning and Multiverse || Anthropic Reasoning\n4.1 Anthropic Reasoning\n\nThe physical conditions necessary for our existence impose a selection\neffect on what we observe. The significance of this point for\ncosmological theorizing is exemplified by Dicke\u2019s criticism of\nDirac\u2019s speculative \u201clarge number hypothesis\u201d. Dirac\n(1937) noted the age of the universe expressed in terms of fundamental\nconstants in atomic physics is an extremely large number (roughly\n\\(10^{39}\\)), which coincides with other large, dimensionless numbers\ndefined in terms of fundamental constants. Inspired by this\ncoincidence, he proposed that the large numbers vary to maintain this\norder of magnitude agreement, implying (for example) that the\ngravitational \u201cconstant\u201d \\(G\\) is a function of cosmic\ntime. Dicke (1961) noted\nthat creatures like us, made of carbon produced in an earlier\ngeneration of red giants and sustained by the light and heat of a main\nsequence star, can only exist within a restricted interval of cosmic\ntimes, and that Dirac\u2019s coincidence holds for observations made\nwithin this interval. Establishing that the coincidence holds at a\nrandomly chosen \\(t\\) would support Dirac\u2019s hypothesis, however\nslightly, but Dicke\u2019s argument shows that our evidence\ndoes not do so.\n\nDicke\u2019s reasoning illustrates how taking selection effects into\naccount can mitigate surprise, and undermine the apparent implications\nof facts like those noted by Dirac (see Roush 2003). These facts\nreflect biases in the evidence available to us, rather than supporting\nhis hypothesis. It is also clear that Dicke\u2019s argument is\n\u201canthropic\u201d in only a very limited sense: his argument\ndoes not depend on a detailed characterization of human observers. All\nthat matters is that we can exist at a cosmic time constrained by the\ntime scales of stellar evolution.\n\nHow to account for selection effects, within a particular approach to\nconfirmation theory, is one central issue in discussions of anthropic\nreasoning. This question is intertwined with other issues that are\nmore muddled and contentious. Debates among cosmologists regarding\n\u201canthropic principles\u201d ignited in the 70s, prompted by the\nsuggestion that finely-tuned features of the universe\u2014such as\nthe universe\u2019s isotropy (Collins & Hawking 1973)\u2014can\nbe explained as necessary conditions for the existence of\nobservers.[41]\nMore recently, a number of cosmologists have argued that cosmological\ntheories should be evaluated based on predictions for what a\n\u201ctypical\u201d observer should expect to see. These ideas have\ndovetailed with work in formal epistemology. A number of philosophers\nhave developed extensions of Bayesianism to account for\n\u201cself-locating\u201d evidence, for\nexample.[42]\nThis kind of evidence includes indexical information characterizing an\nagent\u2019s beliefs about their identity and location. At present\nwork in this area has not reached a consensus, and we will present a\nbrief overview of some of the considerations that have motivated\ndifferent positions in these debates.\n\nIn cosmology the most famous example of an \u201canthropic\nprediction\u201d is Weinberg (1987)\u2019s prediction for\n \\(\\Lambda\\).[43]\n One part of Weinberg\u2019s argument is similar to Dicke\u2019s: he\nargued that there are anthropic bounds on \\(\\Lambda\\), due to its\nimpact on structure formation. The existence of large, gravitationally\nbound structures such as galaxies is only possible if \\(\\Lambda\\)\nfalls within certain bounds. Weinberg went a step further than Dicke,\nand considered what value of \\(\\Lambda\\) a \u201ctypical\nobserver\u201d should see. He assumed that observers occupy different\nlocations within a multiverse, and that the value of \\(\\Lambda\\)\nvaries across different regions. Weinberg further argues that the\nprior probability assigned to different values of \\(\\Lambda\\) should\nbe uniform within the anthropic bounds. Typical observers should\nexpect to see a value close to the mean of the anthropic bounds,\nleading to Weinberg\u2019s prediction for \\(\\Lambda\\).\n\nEssential to Weinberg\u2019s argument is an appeal to the principle\nof indifference, applied to a class of\n observers.[44]\n We should calculate what we expect to observe, that is, as if we are\na \u201crandom choice\u201d among all possible\n observers.[45]\n Bostrom (2002) argues that indifference-style reasoning is necessary\nto respond to the problem of \u201cfreak observers\u201d. As Bostrom\nformulates it, the problem is that in an infinite universe,\nany observation \\(O\\) is true for some observer\n(even if only for an observer who has fluctuated into existence from\nthe vacuum). His response is that we should evaluate theories based\nnot on the claim that some observer sees \\(O\\), but on an\nindexical claim: that is, we make the observation \\(O\\). He\nassumes that we are a \u201crandom\u201d choice among the class of\npossible observers. (How to justify such a strong claim is a major\nchallenge for this line of thought.) If we grant the assumption, then\nwe can assign low probability to the observations of the\n\u201cfreak\u201d observers, and recover the evidential value of\n\\(O\\).\n\nThere are three immediate questions regarding this proposal. The first\nis called the \u201creference class\u201d problem. The assignments\nof probabilities to events requires specifying how they are grouped\n together.[46]\n Obviously, what is typical with respect to one reference class will\nnot be typical with respect to another (compare, for example,\n\u201cconscious observers\u201d with \u201ccarbon-based\nlife\u201d). Second, the principle of indifference has been\nthoroughly criticized as a justification for probability in other\ncontexts; what justifies the use of indifference in this case? Why\nshould we take ourselves as \u201crandomly chosen\u201d among an\nappropriate reference class? The third problem reflects the intended\napplication of these ideas: Bostrom and other authors in this line of\nwork are particularly concerned with observes that may occupy an\ninfinite universe. There is no proof that the universe is in fact\ninfinite. These are all pressing problems for those who hold that the\nprinciple of indifference is essential to making cosmological\npredictions.\n\nFurthermore, one way of implementing this approach leads to absurd\nconsequences. The Doomsday Argument, for example, claims to reach a\nstriking conclusion about the future of the human species without any\nempirical input (see, e.g., Leslie 1992; Gott 1993; Bostrom 2002).\nSuppose that we are \u201ctypical\u201d humans, in the sense of\nhaving a birth rank that is randomly selected among the collection of\nall humans that have ever lived. We should then expect that there are\nnearly as many humans before and after us in overall birth rank. For\nthis to be true, given current rates of population growth, there must\nbe a catastrophic drop in the human population\n(\u201cDoomsday\u201d) in the near future. The challenge to\nadvocates of indifference applied to observers is to articulate\nprinciples that avoid such consequences, while still solving (alleged)\nproblems such as that of freak observers.\n\nIn sum, one approach to anthropic reasoning aims to clarify the rules\nof reasoning applicable to predictions made by observers in a large or\ninfinite universe. This line of work is motivated by the idea that\nwithout such principles we face a severe skeptical predicament, as\nobservations would not have any bearing on the theory. Yet there is\nstill not general agreement on the new principles required to handle\nthese cases, which are of course not scientifically testable\nprinciples: they are philosophically based proposals. According to an\nalternative approach, selection effects can and should be treated\nwithin the context of a Bayesian approach to inductive inference (see\nNeal 2006; Trotta 2008). On this line of thought,\n\u201cpredictions\u201d like those that Bostrom and others hope to\nanalyze play no direct role in the evaluation of cosmological\ntheories, so further principles governing anthropic reasoning are\nsimply not necessary. There is much further work to be done in\nclarifying and assessing these (and other) approaches to anthropic\n reasoning.[47]\n\n",
