    "preamble": "\n\nAs standardly conceived, transcendental arguments are taken to be\ndistinctive in involving a certain sort of claim, namely that\nX is a necessary condition for the possibility of\nY\u2014where then, given that Y is the case, it\nlogically follows that X must be the case too. Moreover,\nbecause these arguments are generally used to respond to sceptics who\ntake our knowledge claims to be problematic, the Y in\nquestion is then normally taken to be some fact about us or our mental\nlife which the sceptic can be expected to accept without question\n(e.g., that we have experiences, or make certain judgements, or\nperform certain actions, or have certain capacities, and so on), where\nX is then something the sceptic doubts or denies (e.g., the\nexistence of the external world, or of the necessary causal relation\nbetween events, or of other minds, or the force of moral reasons). In\nthis way, it is hoped, scepticism can be overturned using\ntranscendental arguments that embody such transcendental claims.\n\nAt first sight, this anti-sceptical potential of such arguments makes\nthem seem powerful and attractive, by offering a proof of what\notherwise might seem to be known only through inductive reasoning or\nfallible experience. However, as we shall see, transcendental\narguments conceived of in this ambitious form have struggled to live\nup to this promise, though they still have their devotees.\nNonetheless, the potential for such arguments has been kept alive, by\nreassessing their possible uses, where it has been suggested that they\ncan perhaps be given a more modest role, which then makes them more\nviable and enables their apparent difficulties to be set aside.\nWhether this is indeed the case, and whether even if it is, this then\nleaves them denuded of their anti-sceptical value and allure, remains\nan open question, and will be discussed further below. We will then\ndiscuss some recent developments in modal metaphysics and epistemology\nto see if they provide useful conceptual resources. We will also\nconsider how far transcendental arguments can serve a role not just in\nepistemology in defending our claims to knowledge, but also in ethics,\nin persuading the sceptic of the force of certain moral considerations\nand principles. Moreover, we will briefly discuss how transcendental\narguments have been used in philosophy of psychology and perception,\nwhere anti-scepticism is often not the goal.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. History and Exemplars\n\nAlthough Immanuel Kant rarely uses the term \u2018transcendental\nargument\u2019, and when he does it is not in our current sense (cf.\nHookway 1999: 180 n. 8; cf. Austin 1961), he nonetheless speaks\nfrequently of \u2018transcendental deductions\u2019,\n\u2018transcendental expositions\u2019, and \u2018transcendental\nproofs\u2019, which roughly speaking have the force of what is today\nmeant by \u2018transcendental argument\u2019. Prior exemplars of\nsuch arguments may perhaps be claimed, such as Aristotle\u2019s proof\nof the principle of non-contradiction (see Metaphysics\n1005b35\u20131006a28; Illies 2003: 45\u20136, Walker 2006: 240 and\n255\u20136); but Kant nonetheless formulated what are generally taken\nto be the central examples of such arguments, so the history of the\ntopic is usually assumed to start here, with the Critique of Pure\nReason and its Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, Second\nAnalogy, and Refutation of Idealism. Briefly put, the Deduction is\ndirected against Humean scepticism concerning the applicability of\na priori concepts to our experience; the Second Analogy\nconcerns Humean doubts over causal powers or forces; while the\nRefutation of Idealism focuses on Cartesian (methodological) doubts\nconcerning the existence of the external world.\n\nPerhaps because of its brevity and relative clarity, but also perhaps\nbecause of the hope it can be made \u2018self-standing\u2019 and\nindependent of the (to some) disreputable machinery of transcendental\nidealism [see \u00a73 of the entry on\n Immanuel Kant],\n it is the Refutation that has become the paradigm to many of a\ntranscendental argument. While the wisdom of this can be questioned\n(cf. Bell 1999, where the Refutation is called \u2018a mistaken\nparadigm\u2019), the Refutation undoubtedly makes a useful place for\nus to start.\n\nAs presented by Kant, the Refutation is aimed at the\n\u2018problematic idealism of Descartes\u2019, who holds that the\nexistence of objects outside us in space is \u2018doubtful and\nindemonstrable\u2019 (Kant 1781/1787 B274)\u2014where, as Kant\nfamously remarks in the Preface to the second edition of the\nCritique in which he comments on the Refutation, \u2018it\nalways remains a scandal of philosophy and universal human reason that\nthe existence of things outside us (from which we after all get the\nwhole matter for our cognitions, even for our inner sense) should have\nto be assumed merely on faith, and that if it occurs to\nanyone to doubt it, we should be unable to answer him with a\nsatisfactory proof\u2019 (Kant 1781/1787 Bxxxix note). Kant\u2019s\nstrategy in response then sets the canonical pattern for a\ntranscendental argument, in beginning from what the sceptic takes for\ngranted, namely that we have mental states which we experience as\nhaving a temporal order, and then arguing for the transcendental claim\nthat experience of this sort would not be possible unless we also had\ngenerally veridical experience of things in space outside us, and thus\nknowledge of the external world. In more detail, the argument can be\npresented as follows (cf. Kant 1781/1787 B275\u201379 and\nBxxxix\u2013xli note):\n\n(1) You are aware of\nyour inner mental states (thoughts and sensations) as having a\ntemporal order (e.g., that the sensation of pain you are having now\nwas preceded in time by a feeling of pleasure).\n(2) To be aware of your\nmental states as having a temporal order, you must be aware of\nsomething that existed from the time of your previous mental state to\nthe present.\n(3) For that awareness\nof permanence to be possible, it is not sufficient to have awareness\nof your self (because no permanent self is revealed to us in inner\nsense, as Hume argued: see Hume 1739\u201340: 252) or to have\nimpressions or representations (because these impressions have a\n\u2018perishing existence\u2019, as Hume also argued: see Hume\n1739\u201340: 194).\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(4) The\n\u2018permanent\u2019 of which you are aware must be something that\nis neither you qua subject nor your subjective impressions\nbut must be something distinct from both of these, that is, an object\noutside you in the external world.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(5) Your awareness of\nthe external world cannot come from a prior awareness of your\nsubjective impressions because the latter awareness is not possible\nwithout the former, and so awareness of the external world cannot be\nbased on the imagination but rather comes from generally veridical\nexperiences.\n\n\nIn this way, Kant hoped to \u2018turn the game played by idealism\nagainst itself\u2019 (cf. B276), by working from the inner experience\nthat it takes for granted and showing that this depends on an outer\nexperience which the idealist doubts, so that in this manner the\n\u2018scandal to philosophy\u2019 posed by such doubts can finally\nbe resolved.\n\nHowever, despite its brevity, the Refutation has given rise to\nconsiderable dispute and discussion, not only because questions can be\nraised about the details of the argument, but also because\nKant\u2019s wider theoretical commitments to transcendental idealism\nhave also rendered the Refutation problematic and his intentions\nunclear: for example, doesn\u2019t the argument undermine\nKant\u2019s own idealism in some way, and how does the\nRefutation relate to the somewhat similar argument in the Fourth\nParalogism of the first edition of the Critique\n(A366\u201380), but in which an appeal to transcendental idealism\nplays a greater role? These complications have led to a range of\ndisputes concerning the Refutation, from whether or not it can be made\ncogent, to whether or not it fits within Kant\u2019s own\nphilosophical project, and indeed whether focusing on this as\nKant\u2019s response to scepticism distorts his conception of\nscepticism, and how he thought it should be resolved. (For further\ndiscussion of the Refutation, see Guyer 1987: 279\u2013332, Caranti\n2007, Dicker 2008.)\n\nTranscendental arguments found a place in philosophy after Kant,\nincluding in the post-Kantian German idealist tradition (cf. Franks\n1999, Franks 2005: 201\u201359, Taylor 1976, Beiser 2005:\n174\u201391, Rockmore & Breazeale 2014, Nance 2015, Tse 2020,\nSch\u00fcz 2022; but for some critical discussion of Taylor see Stern\n2013 and Houlgate 2015, and of Beiser see Stern 2012). However, their\nprominence in more contemporary analytic philosophy is largely due to\nthe work of P. F. Strawson, and particularly his earlier books\nIndividuals and The Bounds of Sense\u2014the latter\nof which is a commentary on Kant\u2019s Critique, while the\nformer is written under its influence in a broader way (cf. Grundmann\n1994; Niquet 1991; Callanan 2011). One example from these works is the\n\u2018objectivity argument\u2019 to be found in The Bounds of\nSense, which aims to show that \u2018[u]nity of diverse\nexperiences in a single consciousness requires experience of\nobjects\u2019; the argument may be outlined as follows (see Strawson\n1966: 97\u2013112, esp. 108; also see Cassam 1997, Cheng 2021a):\n\n(1) Being\nself-conscious is a matter of being able to ascribe diverse\nexperiences to oneself, while being conscious of the unity of that to\nwhich they are ascribed.\n(2) To be in a position\nto think of experiences as one\u2019s own, one must be able\nto think of them as experiences.\n(3) For experience to\nbe such as to provide room for thought of experience itself, it must\nprovide room for a distinction between \u2018This is how things\nare\u2019 and \u2018This is how things are experienced as\nbeing\u2019.\n(4) Only experience of\nobjects that are subject-independent could provide room for this\nis/seems distinction.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(5) Subject-independent objects exist.\n\n\nIn this way, Strawson hoped to capture what he took to be the central\ncore of Kant\u2019s position, but without appeal to the\n\u2018doctrines of transcendental psychology\u2019 (Strawson 1966:\n97), which he found to be problematic. Likewise, in\nIndividuals, Strawson presented an argument starting from the\npremise that we think of the world as containing objective particulars\nin a single spatiotemporal system, to the conclusion that objects\ncontinue to exist unperceived, where the latter is said to be required\nin order to make possible the kind of identification and\nre-identification necessary for the former (cf. Strawson 1959:\n31\u201358). Thus, as Strawson famously put it, the sceptic\n\u2018pretends to accept a conceptual scheme\u2019 of a world\ncontaining objects in a spatio-temporal system, \u2018but at the same\ntime quietly rejects one of the conditions of its employment\u2019\n(Strawson 1959: 35).\n\nOn the basis of the promise of arguments of this sort from Strawson,\nand from others (such as Shoemaker 1963: 168\u20139), together with\ngrowing interest in the work of Kant himself within analytic\nphilosophy, this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s was a\nsignificant one for the history of transcendental arguments, leading\nto much subsequent discussion. At the same time, central\nWittgensteinian doctrines prominent at the time (such as the notion of\n\u2018criteria\u2019: see \u00a71.3 of the entry on\n other minds)\n were also given a transcendental inflection, so certain\nWittgensteinian claims came to take on the form of transcendental\narguments (cf. Rorty 1971: 3, where he comments that \u2018Many\nadmirers of Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations\nand of Strawson\u2019s Individuals have taken the theme of\nboth books to be an analysis of philosophical skepticism and their\ndistinctive contribution to be a new way of criticizing the\nskeptic\u2019). However, crucial to the debates of the period were\nalso a number of critical articles pointing to the perceived\nlimitation of the transcendental approach, including those by Stefan\nK\u00f6rner (K\u00f6rner 1966, 1967, 1969) and by Barry Stroud (Stroud\n1968), where the latter in particular shaped the ensuing discussion\nover the value of transcendental arguments and what they could be\nexpected to achieve, as we shall see in\n section 3.\n\nNonetheless, while the intervention by Stroud and others led to doubts\nabout the value of transcendental arguments, as theorists asked if\nthese critiques held good and if so what might remain of the\ntranscendental approach, this did not deter prominent philosophers\ncontinuing to produce transcendental arguments. Two of these may serve\nas further exemplars of the genre, where both have gone on to be much\ndiscussed. The first was offered by Hilary Putnam in relation to\nexternal world skepticism once again, and the second by Donald\nDavidson, this time relating more directly to the problem of other\nminds.\n\nPutnam\u2019s argument comes in Chapter 1 of Reason, Truth and\nHistory, where his goal is to refute a modern-day version of\nDescartes\u2019 evil demon hypothesis, according to which I do not\ninhabit a world containing ordinary physical objects (trees, tables,\nhouses), but I am a brain in a vat in a lab whose experiences are\ncaused by a computer artificially stimulating my nerve endings, so\nthat none of these objects actually exist beyond my hallucinatory\nimpression of them (see the entries on Brains in a Vat and\nSkepticism and Content Externalism). This is the brain-in-a-vat\nhypothesis, and it stands for the possibility that, for all I know,\nnothing rules out the world being very different from how it appears\nto me to be, given the gap that exists between appearance (our\nexperience of it) and reality.\n\nNow, Putnam\u2019s response to the sceptic is to argue that though we\ncannot rule out the possibility that we are brains-in-vats on the\ngrounds of how things appear to us, we can rule it out nonetheless.\nHow? Here is one reconstruction of the reasoning: we can rule it out\nbecause on a plausible theory of reference, it is self-refuting: that\nis, \u2018I am a brain-in-a-vat [or BIV, for short]\u2019 cannot be\ntruly affirmed by anyone. The theory of reference Putnam uses as a\npremise is a causal one, which states that \u2018one cannot refer to\ncertain kinds of things, e.g., trees, if one has no causal\ninteraction at all with them, or with things in terms of which they\ncan be described\u2019 (Putnam 1981: 16\u201317). Putnam defends\nthis theory, on the grounds that it alone can explain how reference\noccurs in a way that is not \u2018magical\u2019, i.e., which does\nnot assume that the connection is just somehow intrinsic between\nrepresentations and their referents. It then follows, according to\nPutnam, that a BIV affirming \u2018I am a BIV\u2019 is saying\nsomething true only if the BIV is in what the BIV is calling a\n\u2018vat\u2019. But the BIV is not in one of those; rather, he is\nin a real vat. What he is calling a \u2018vat\u2019 is that\nto which his use of that term causally connects in a referential\nway\u2014where for a BIV, that is something in the computer that\nprompts his applications of \u2018vat\u2019 by giving him\nhallucinations of the appearance of vats. Yet the BIV is not in that\npart of the computer. Thus, Putnam concludes, \u2018I am a BIV\u2019\ncannot be truly asserted by anyone, much like \u2018I do not\nexist\u2019 or \u2018I cannot construct a meaningful sentence\u2019\n(cf. Bardon 2005). It therefore cannot ever be wrong to assert that\none is not a BIV, so that in this sense \u2018I am not a BIV\u2019\nis an incorrigible claim (cf. Putnam 1981: 14\u201315). Putnam\ntherefore holds that we can rule out the BIV hypothesis on a\npriori grounds, and thus refute the sceptic.\n\nPutnam is keen to emphasise the transcendental nature of his\nenterprise in this respect. He stresses that the kinds of constraints\non reference that operate here and disprove the BIV hypothesis are not\nphysical or merely analytic, but involve limitations on what is\npossible that can be arrived at through philosophical reflection on\nthe nature of representation and meaning, and hence fit into a broadly\nKantian model of how to respond to scepticism, albeit with more\nempirical elements:\n\nWhat we have been doing is considering the preconditions for\nthinking about, representing, referring to, etc. We have\ninvestigated these preconditions not by investigating the\nmeaning of these words and phrases (as a linguist might, for example)\nbut by reasoning a priori. Not in the old\n\u2018absolute\u2019 sense (since we do not claim that magical\ntheories of reference are a priori wrong), but in the sense\nof inquiring into what is reasonably possible\nassuming certain general premisses, or making certain very\nbroad theoretical assumptions. Such a procedure is neither\n\u2018empirical\u2019 nor quite \u2018a priori\u2019, but has\nelements of both ways of investigating. In spite of the fallibility of\nmy procedure, and its dependence upon assumptions which might be\ndescribed as \u2018empirical\u2019 (e.g., the assumption that the\nmind has no access to external things or properties apart from that\nprovided by the senses), my procedure has a close relation to what\nKant called a \u2018transcendental\u2019 investigation; for it is an\ninvestigation, I repeat, of the preconditions of reference\nand hence of thought\u2014preconditions built in to the nature of our\nminds themselves, though not (as Kant hoped) wholly independent of\nempirical assumptions. (Putnam 1981: 16)\n\n\nAs a result of his attempt to respond to external world scepticism in\nthis way, Putnam has had an important influence in reviving interest\nin the possibility of using transcendental arguments against\nscepticism. (For further discussion of Putnam\u2019s position, see\nBrueckner 1986, Coppock 1987, Heil 1987, David 1991, Brueckner 1992,\nCaranti 2007: 110\u201313.)\n\nFinally, we may turn to the work of Donald Davidson, who like Putnam\nbases his transcendental claim on a form of externalism, which links\nthe content of our mental states to how we relate to our environment;\nbut in his case, this idea is directed against scepticism concerning\nother minds. Thus, while the sceptic holds that the existence of such\nminds is doubtful, Davidson argues that it would not be possible for a\ncreature like me to have thoughts unless I lived in a world with other\ncreatures who also had thoughts, so the truth of the latter can be\ndeduced from the fact that I am indeed capable of thinking:\n\u2018What are the conditions necessary for the existence of thought,\nand so in particular for the existence of people with thoughts? I\nbelieve there could not be thoughts in one mind if there were no other\nthoughtful creatures with which the first mind shared a natural\nworld\u2019 (Davidson 1989: 193; note that he uses\n\u2018existence,\u2019 not \u2018possibility\u2019). On one\ninterpretation, Davidson\u2019s transcendental argument is based on\nhis account of what it takes for a thought to have content, for which\nhe argues that a process of \u2018triangulation\u2019 must occur,\nwhereby the content of the thought someone is having is\n\u2018fixed\u2019 by the way in which someone else correlates the\nresponses he makes to something in the world. Thus, Davidson argues,\nif there were no other people, the content of our thoughts would be\ntotally indeterminate, and we would in effect have no thoughts at all;\nfrom the self-evident falsity of the latter, he therefore deduces the\nfalsity of the former (cf. Davidson 1991: 159\u201360). Davidson\ntherefore argues that the mistake the sceptic makes, in common with\nthe Cartesian heritage of which he is part, is in the assumption that\nit is possible to be a lone thinker: Davidson\u2019s\ntranscendental argument is designed to show that this is not in fact\nthe case, given the constraints on what it takes to have thoughts with\ncontent, so that the existence of a single thinking subject entails\nthe existence of others.\n\nAs Davidson suggests (cf. Davidson 1991: 157), his position here might\nbe said to have certain similarities to that put forward in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Private Language Argument, at least under the\ninterpretation given by Kripke (see Kripke 1982). Kripke takes\nWittgenstein as arguing that it is impossible to make sense of what it\nis to follow a rule correctly, unless this means that what one is\ndoing is following the practice of others who are like-minded: what\nmakes our continuation of some addition rule a case of rule-following\nat all (for example), is that the community goes on in the same way;\nand, unless addition were rule-governed as a practice, statements like\n\u20182+2=4\u2019 could have no meaning. Thus, from the fact that we\nare able to make such statements meaningfully, the existence of a\ncommunity of others that \u2018fix\u2019 this rule can be inferred,\nas a necessary pre-condition for the former (cf. Kripke 1982: 89). On\nthis view, then, unless the sceptic is prepared to admit the existence\nof this community of fellow-speakers, and thus attribute a capacity\nfor intentional rule-following to those around him, he cannot make\nsense of the idea of meaningful thought in his own case.\n\nWe have therefore seen that taking their inspiration from Kant to a\ngreater or lesser degree, philosophers have come to develop a range of\ntranscendental arguments that are intended to refute scepticism in a\nrobust and ambitious manner, by establishing anti-sceptical\nconclusions on the basis of transcendental claims. From these\nexemplars and others, therefore, we may now say something further\nabout how such arguments work and what makes them distinctive.\n2. Key Features of Transcendental Arguments\n\nFrom something like the canon of transcendental arguments outlined\nabove, the characteristic marks and the significance of such\narguments might be listed as follows:\n\n1. Transcendental arguments are typically anti-sceptical, so that (as\nStrawson puts it) it is widely assumed that \u2018the point of\ntranscendental arguments in general is an anti-sceptical point\u2019\n(Strawson 1985: 10). Moreover, in the ambitious form in which we have\nconsidered them so far, they refute the sceptic in a direct manner, by\npurporting to prove what she doubts or questions, and they do so on\ntheir own, without bringing in any wider epistemological theories or\nconsiderations. And these arguments are what is sometimes called\nworld-directed or \u00adtruth-directed, as opposed to\nself-directed (cf. Peacocke 1989: 4; Cassam 1997: 33; Cassam\n1999: 83): that is, they set out to establish the truth of some claim\nabout how reality is and what it contains (such as subject-independent\nobjects in space and time, or other minds, or causal laws).\n\n2. Because of their anti-sceptical ambitions, transcendental arguments\nmust begin from a starting point that the sceptic can be expected to\naccept, the necessary condition of which is then said to be something\nthat the sceptic doubts or denies. This will then mean that such\narguments are ineffective against very radical forms of scepticism,\nwhich doubt the laws of logic, and/or which refuse to accept\nany starting point as uncontentious; and it will also mean\nthat they may be effective against a sceptic who is prepared to accept\nsome starting point, but then ineffective against another sceptic who\nis not. But neither of these features of transcendental arguments need\nbe felt to be disabling: for the scepticism of the radical sceptics is\nperhaps of dubious coherence, or at least of little interest because\nthey seem so unwilling to engage with us, while the second limitation\nmay mean merely that different transcendental arguments are required\nfor different sceptical audiences.\n\n3. Because of the need to find an uncontentious starting point,\ntranscendental arguments will also then characteristically be first\npersonal, by beginning from how I or we experience,\nthink, judge, and so on. Thus, while it is perhaps reasonable to hold\nthat there are necessary conditions for the possibility of\n\u2018extra-personal\u2019 entities such as material objects,\nsubstances, the universe, time and so on, a transcendental argument\nwhich is directed against scepticism is unlikely to be concerned with\nexploring such conditions, as the sceptic is unlikely to admit the\nexistence of the things to which the conditions belong.\n\n4. Transcendental arguments involve transcendental claims, to\nthe effect that X is a necessary condition for the\npossibility of Y, where in saying this, the arguments do not\nassume this to be a matter of merely causal, natural, or nomological\nnecessity. Given that their target is the sceptic who challenges our\nclaims about the world, there are clearly two good reasons for this.\nFirst, although our observation of the world might suggest that\nexperience has certain necessary causal conditions (e.g., light and\nsound must be transmitted between particular wavelengths), we can\nhardly use such considerations against a sceptic of this sort, for\nwhom all such empirical knowledge is in question, and against whom we\nare therefore required to adopt a position that is less open to doubt\nin this way. Second, if the transcendental argument\u2019s claim is\none of only natural necessity, then this allows that there are\nmetaphysically possible worlds (for example, where the laws of physics\ndo not hold) in which this claim is false, again opening us up to the\nsceptical challenge of showing we are not in such a world.\n\n5. However, if the transcendental claims involved are not a matter of\nmerely causal or natural necessity, this then raises the question of\nwhat form of necessity they do in fact involve. If they were\ntrue in virtue of their meaning alone (even if unobviously so), and\nthus analytic, then the necessity might be said to be purely logical,\nwhere to deny the claim is then to assert some form of logical\ncontradiction (cf. Bennett 1979, Walker 1978: 18\u201323, Walker\n1989: 63\u20134, Bell 1999). Assuming that the problematic\nanalytic/synthetic distinction is viable, this may still not seem\nto be the case in many instances of such transcendental claims, where\nin fact they may be said to be synthetic a priori (cf.\nWilkerson 1976: 199\u2013213). To many, nonetheless, it has appeared\nthat the transcendental claim is not a logical necessity, but stands\nsomewhere between that and natural necessity, perhaps putting it into\nthe camp of metaphysical necessity, as this is sometimes\nunderstood: that is, a necessary relation which holds not by virtue of\nlogical or causal constraints on the nature of logical or physical\npossibilities, but by virtue of metaphysical constraints on how things\ncan be\u2014much as the fact that nothing can be red and green all\nover is arguably not determined by any law of logic or causal law, but\nthe nature of colour, and how it can be exemplified in things. There\nwill be more on this in section 5 below.\n\n6. It is then partly because of the apparently rather special nature\nof these transcendental claims, that the suspicion arises that there\nwill then turn out to be something distinctively Kantian about such\narguments; for Kant made it the focus of his critical project to\naccount for metaphysical knowledge of this sort, where transcendental\nidealism is then supposed to provide the answer to how such knowledge\nis possible. The idea, roughly speaking, is that it is too much for us\nto be able to know how things must be beyond the limits of our\nexperience, and so claim metaphysical knowledge of\nthings-in-themselves. By contrast, once we confine ourselves to how\nthings appear to us given our ways of seeing and thinking about the\nworld, then we can understand how we could at least acquire knowledge\nof how things must behave as phenomena, by knowing about the forms of\nintuitions and concepts through which such phenomena must appear to us\nif we are to experience them at all (cf. Williams 1974, Pippin 1988,\nStroud 1999, Stroud 2000a). However, as we saw in the case of\nStrawson, whether or not such full-blooded Kantian commitments are\nnecessary to the transcendental argument strategy is a matter of\ndispute. Indeed, some have argued that there is a \u2018neglected\nalternative\u2019 here: namely, while Kant might be right to hold\nthat we cannot plausibly claim insight into the constraints on the\nworld itself but only on the nature of our sensibility and\nunderstanding, nonetheless we can argue from this that the world must\nitself be a certain way to fit these conditions, without thereby\nthinking that it is mind-dependent or that all we thereby know is how\nthings appear to us. The analogy is thus drawn to a case such as the\nfollowing: once we know how our lungs work, we can know what the air\nmust be like in order to allow us to breath, without the nature\nof air being determined by how our lungs work (cf. Harrison 1989,\nWestphal 2004: 68\u2013126).\n\nThe features discussed above therefore have a reasonable claim to be\nwhat make transcendental arguments distinctive, at least of the sort\nwe have considered so far. However, as we shall now go on to see,\ntranscendental arguments of this type have turned out to be open to\nserious objections, so that alternative models have been proposed\nwhich do not incorporate all these features in quite the same way.\n3. Objections to Transcendental Arguments\n\nJust as the rise in interest in transcendental arguments within\ntwentieth-century philosophy can largely be traced back to the work of\nStrawson, so too the subsequent disillusionment can largely be traced\nback to the work of one person, namely Barry Stroud, in his\ninfluential 1968 article (Stroud 1968). In that paper, Stroud focused\non the nature of the transcendental claim that the truth of some\nproposition S is a necessary condition for the possibility of\nlanguage, but then argued that \u2018the sceptic can always very\nplausibly insist that it is enough to make language possible if we\nbelieve that S is true, or that it looks for all the\nworld as if it is, but that S needn\u2019t actually be\ntrue\u2019 (Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24]). Moreover, the general problem\nthis raises is that if such a response by the sceptic is plausible in\nthe case of language, perhaps it is also plausible in the case of\nother starting-points too? Thus, for example, when it comes to\nscepticism about the existence of the external world or other minds,\nmaybe no argument can be constructed to show there must actually\nbe such a world or minds as a condition for inner experience\nor the having of thoughts, but just that we must believe them to\nexist, or that they must seem to us to do so\u2014which hardly looks\nlike enough to quash sceptical doubts on these matters.\n\nNow, in the 1968 paper, Stroud appears to get to his conclusion by\narguing from an analysis of specific cases (viz. arguments proposed by\nStrawson and Shoemaker in Strawson 1959 and Shoemaker 1963\nrespectively). But then, this may seem to leave open the hope that\neven if these arguments fall to his critique, others may not. However,\nin subsequent work, Stroud has said more to substantiate his objection\nand make it seem more likely to hold across the board. For, while he\nallows that we might reasonably be able to make modal claims about\n\u2018how our thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that we\nalso think in certain other ways\u2019, he believes it is puzzling\n\u2018how\u2026truths about the world which appear to say or imply\nnothing about human thought or experience\u2019 (for example, that\nthings exist outside us in space and time, or that there are other\nminds) \u2018[can] be shown to be genuinely necessary conditions of\nsuch psychological facts as that we think and experience things in\ncertain ways, from which the proofs begin\u2019. Stroud goes on:\n\u2018It would seem that we must find, and cross, a bridge of\nnecessity from the one to the other. That would be a truly remarkable\nfeat, and some convincing explanation would surely be needed of how\nthe whole thing is possible\u2019 (Stroud 1994 [2000b: 158\u20139;\ncf. also 212]). Thus, Stroud is prepared to allow \u2018that we can\ncome to see how our thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that\nwe also think in certain other ways, and so perhaps in certain other\nways as well, and we can appreciate how rich and complicated the\nrelations between those ways of thinking must be\u2019 (Stroud 1994\n[2000b: 158\u20139]); but he believes that anything more than this,\nwhich asserts that \u2018non-psychological facts\u2019 about the\nworld outside us constitute necessary conditions for our thinking, is\nproblematic.\n\nThen, having apparently established that the strongest defensible\ntranscendental claims concern merely how things must appear to us or\nwhat we must believe, the second stage of Stroud\u2019s argument is\nthat in order to bridge the gap that this has opened up, and to get to\na conclusion about how things actually are, one must opt\neither for verificationism or idealism. The former holds that in order\nto be meaningful, a sentence must say something that we can determine\nto be true or false. If so, then we cannot be left in the limbo of\nsceptical doubt behind a veil of appearances wondering where the truth\nlies. The latter sees no gap between how the world is and how we think\nthings are or merely appear to us. However, aside from the potentially\nproblematic nature of both these positions, an appeal to either\nverificationism or idealism is also dialectically unsatisfactory, as\nany such appeal would appear to render the transcendental argument\nitself redundant\u2014for each on its own is powerful enough to\ndisarm sceptical worries, without the transcendental manoeuvre now\nbeing required (cf. Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24\u20135]). In this way,\nStroud has convinced many that the proponent of transcendental\narguments faces an unattractive dilemma: either to dispense with\nverificationism or idealism, but fall short of the anti-sceptical\nconclusion concerning how things are; or to accept verificationism or\nidealism, but then make the transcendental argument itself\nsuperfluous.\n\nThe problem that Stroud has highlighted may be briefly illustrated by\nreturning to the exemplars of transcendental arguments that we\nconsidered in\n Section 1.\n Thus, when it comes to Kant\u2019s Refutation of Idealism, it can be\nsaid that the most that Kant really establishes is that we have\nexperience as of things outside us in space, while all that\nStrawson\u2019s objectivity argument shows is that we must\napply the is/seems distinction to our experience, and so\nbelieve that things exist without us experiencing them, but that this\ndoesn\u2019t do enough to show that this distinction is really a\nvalid one (cf. Wilkerson 1976: 57, Brueckner 1989). Likewise, against\nPutnam it is argued that the sceptic can challenge his externalist\ntheory of reference, where on a more internalist view, you could then\nthink about being in a vat even if you were in one, as the meaning of\n\u2018vat\u2019 no longer depends on your relations to the world;\nor, if Putnam insists on his externalism, it could be claimed that\nthis is already a position that rules out scepticism because\nit assumes that the mind and world are linked in important ways,\nmaking it unnecessary to make appeal to the specific transcendental\nargument that Putnam rests upon it (cf. McCulloch 1999). Similarly,\nagainst Davidson it can be argued that thought would be possible, even\nif the \u2018others\u2019 with which one \u2018triangulated\u2019\nwere nothing but robots or automata; or again, if this is ruled out by\nappeal to some form of semantic externalism, this then renders the\ntranscendental argument redundant. In all these cases, therefore, it\nmay appear that Stroudian objections can be used to damaging\neffect.\n\nThus, applying Stroud\u2019s concerns to a range of arguments in this\nway may seem to support the view that the transcendental arguments so\nfar produced succumb to his dilemma (although, of course, attempts to\nbolster the arguments can also be made). Nonetheless, it might be felt\nthat unless Stroud can substantiate his more principled objection to\nthe very possibility of crossing the \u2018bridge of necessity\u2019\nthat is required by any sort of world-directed transcendental claim,\nhe has still not yet established conclusively that no transcendental\nargument can be made to work, and must always either fall short or end\nup being superfluous. So the question arises: how powerful is his\nsuggestion that a \u2018truly remarkable feat\u2019 is required\nhere, one that we have good reason to think cannot feasibly be\naccomplished?\n\nPerhaps one difficulty that can be raised for Stroud, is that while he\nthinks there is something inherently problematic in making a claim\nabout how the world must be as a condition for our thought or\nexperience, he does not think that there is anything particularly\nproblematic about claiming that our thought or experience is a\nnecessary condition for some other aspect of our thought or\nexperience\u2014indeed, he exploits such claims himself in his own\narguments against the sceptic (cf. Stroud 1994 [2000b:\n165\u201376]). But how can claims of necessary connections between\nsome thoughts or experience and some others be defended more cogently\nthan claims of necessary connections between some thoughts or\nexperience and the world? Why are such \u2018bridges\u2019 or modal\nconnections easier to make \u2018within thought\u2019 than between\nhow we think and how the world must be to make that thought possible?\nNow, one might take this symmetry between the two to be reason to be\nsuspicious of claims of necessary connections both between some\nthoughts and the world and between some thoughts and other thoughts\nabout the world: but as we have seen, Stroud himself seems to think\nthey are viable between \u2018psychological facts\u2019 (cf. Stroud\n2000a [2000b: 224\u201344]). If so, it could be argued, he needs to\ngive us some account of why they are less problematic here than\nbetween our thought and the world; but in fact he just seems to take\nit to be obvious, and so provides no such account (cf. Cassam 1987:\n356\u20137; Glock 2003: 38\u20139).\n\nHowever, even if Stroud\u2019s position is indeed weaker than it may\nat first appear, this does not mean that transcendental arguments are\nin the clear when it comes to the world-directed transcendental claims\nthey embody. For, a different worry to the same effect can also be\nurged against them, which in this case relates to the dialectics of\nour engagements with scepticism (cf. Stern 2007). The central thought\nis this: On the one hand, the sceptic is often conceived as grounding\nher doubts on the fallibility of our ordinary belief-forming\nprocesses, such as perception and memory. On the other hand, the\nproponent of a transcendental argument hopes to answer her doubts by\nadvancing the claim that X is a necessary condition for the\npossibility of Y and so deduce the former from the latter.\nBut the dialectical concern this raises is this: why, if the sceptic\nis dubious about cognitive methods like perception and memory, should\nshe be any more sanguine about the methods we have used (whatever\nthese are) to arrive at the modal claims embodied in the\ntranscendental argument?\n\nNow, one line of response might be to say that the doubts the sceptic\nraises over our modal knowledge here can themselves be blocked or\nshown to be spurious, for example, by providing evidence for the\nreliability of our methods in the modal case, or questioning the right\nof the sceptic to use the mere possibility of error against such\nknowledge. But then, it seems likely that similar claims could\nalso be used to bolster the credentials of our\nnon-transcendental bases for knowledge, such as perception\nand memory, in a way that would then render the transcendental\nargument redundant.\n\nThus, even if Stroud\u2019s own critique of transcendental arguments\nis found wanting, it seems that another along these lines can be put\nin its place, leading to a similar dilemma: either transcendental\narguments are offered to try to establish what the sceptic questions,\nbut are then vulnerable to sceptical doubts concerning the truth of\nthe modal claims they employ; or they can successfully respond to\nthose doubts, but in ways that then seem likely to render our\nnon-transcendental grounds for knowledge legitimate too, so that our\nconviction concerning such knowledge no longer seems to need to make\nany appeal to a transcendental argument.\n\nOne further thought is that perhaps the main problem is a consequence\nof mistakenly supposing that transcendental arguments should be\ndeductively valid. Note that Kant himself used the corresponding\nGerman phrase of \u2018deduction\u2019 in a different sense (see the\nentry on Kant\u2019s Transcendental Arguments). One possibility is\nthat such arguments should be taken as abductive ones,\ninvolving inference to the best explanation (Hoffmann 2019, Allen\n2021, Reynolds 2022): the idea is that although one cannot deductively\ninfer X from the possibility of Y, one can claim\nthat X is the best explanation of Y\u2019s being\npossible. In making such an inference, one needs to list various\ncandidate explanations and give good reason to think that the\none being favored is indeed the best explanation. If this path is\ntaken, it might engender worries about the distinctness and power of\ntranscendental arguments. In the next section we will see more\nresponses to the above objections.\n4. Responses to Objections\n\nWhile it would be premature to say that attempts to construct\nambitious world-directed transcendental arguments have been entirely\nabandoned (see e.g., Peacocke 1989, Grundmann & Misselhorn 2003),\nnonetheless the most common way of responding to these Stroudian\ndifficulties has been to re-think how transcendental arguments might\nbe best used, and to come up with strategies that are in various ways\nmore modest than those we have discussed so far. What characterises\nsuch modest responses is the idea that Stroud is indeed right\nthat all we can really substantiate by way of a transcendental claim\nis how things must appear to us or how we must believe them to\nbe\u2014but then attempt to make this weakened claim do some\nanti-sceptical work. We will briefly consider four such responses: one\nfrom Strawson\u2019s earlier work; one from his later writings; one\nfrom Stroud; and one from Stern 2000. (For other recent examples of\nless ambitious transcendental arguments, see Chang 2008 and Massimi\n2014; also see Coates 2017 on Strawson 1962).\n\nThe first response takes its inspiration from a re-consideration of\nthe Strawsonian transcendental arguments that were criticised by\nStroud, but offers a different interpretation of them in the light of\nthat critique. Thus, it is suggested, the mistake is to see\nStrawson\u2019s argument as straightforwardly world-directed in the\nway that it was presented earlier, as offering a direct response to\nthe sceptic by proving what the sceptic doubts. Rather, it is said,\nthe strategy is more like Aristotle\u2019s elenchic response to the\nsceptic who doubts the principle of non-contradiction: namely, to show\nthat her doubts cannot be intelligibly stated or expressed, as\nacceptance of this principle is a necessary condition for having\nmeaningful thought at all. Likewise, therefore, it can be suggested\nthat Strawson intended his transcendental approach to operate in the\nsame way, where (as Strawson puts it) \u2018[the sceptic\u2019s]\ndoubts are unreal, not simply because they are logically unresolvable\ndoubts, but because they amount to the rejection of the whole\nconceptual scheme within which alone such doubts make sense\u2019\n(Strawson 1959: 35; cf. also 106 and 109, and also Glock 2003:\n35\u20136 and Illies 2003: 44\u201356). Thus, it may seem, a modest\ntranscendental claim is all that we require, to the effect that the\nsceptic cannot raise a doubt to challenge us here, given what she must\nbelieve in order for her to think or utter anything intelligible at\nall. The transcendental argument is effective, therefore, not by\nshowing that what the sceptic doubts is false, but by showing that\nthose doubts have violated the conditions of meaningfulness, and thus\nrequire no positive answer or response.\n\nNow, whether or not this is the most charitable way of reading\nStrawson\u2019s earlier position, he himself does not seem to have\nadopted quite this first response when he came to reply to Stroud in\nhis later work. Rather, while he accepts Stroud\u2019s insistence\nthat the transcendental claim must be weakened (cf. Strawson 1985: 9),\nhe then also offers what he call a naturalistic reply to the\nsceptic based on Hume and also on some Wittgensteinian ideas developed\nin On Certainty, according to which the right approach to\nsceptical doubts is not to try to answer them with an argument, but to\nshow them to be \u2018idle\u2019, as unable to shift those core\nbeliefs which are implanted in us by nature or which lie at the centre\nof our ways of thinking (cf. Strawson 1985: 13). Here, then, the\napproach is not about the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of\nsceptical doubt (as on the first response), but on its inability to\nshift or dislodge our beliefs because of their embeddedness within our\nthinking (where semantic issues need not be the only consideration in\nrendering them embedded in this way). Within this naturalistic\napproach, therefore, Strawson suggests that transcendental arguments\ncan do valuable work, in precisely helping us to show the sceptic that\nsome beliefs are fundamental to us in this way, and thus impervious to\nsceptical doubt just as the naturalist claims\u2014but where to play\nthis role, the transcendental claim only has to be a modest one,\nconcerning what we must believe, not how things are (cf. Strawson\n1985: 21\u201323; see also Grayling 1985 and Callanan 2011).\n\nA third type of modest approach is offered by Stroud himself, where he\nclaims that even a transcendental argument which shows what we must\nbelieve can have anti-sceptical value, in showing that these beliefs\nare indispensable and invulnerable, in the sense\nthat we not only cannot abandon them, but also we cannot find them to\nbe false in ourselves or others, because to so find them would be to\ngive up believing anything at all. However, Stroud allows that this\nsort of status for the belief in question\u2014for example, the\nbelief that there are enduring particulars, or other minds\u2014does\nnot go as far as ruling out the possibility that belief of this sort\nare in fact not true (see Stroud 1994, 1999).\n\nFinally, in Stern 2000, it is argued that modest transcendental\narguments can be shown to be useful against scepticism, once we\ndistinguish sufficiently carefully between the kinds of scepticism\nthere are, and go for the right target or targets\u2014where a less\ndemanding form of scepticism may perhaps be defeated by a less\nambitious transcendental claim. So, for example, if we take the target\nto be a sceptic who demands certainty, then a modest transcendental\nargument will not suffice. But if we take the sceptic to be one who\ndemands merely justification that may nonetheless be fallible, and who\nclaims we do not have even this because our beliefs are not properly\nsupported by our generally accepted cognitive norms, then (it is\nclaimed) a modest transcendental argument can indeed be useful. So,\nfor example, the justificatory sceptic may claim that our belief in\nother minds seems to be grounded on nothing but the link between\nbehaviour and mentality that we observe in our own case; but then, she\ncan argue, it is based on little more than a poor argument from\nanalogy, which we are not properly warranted in extending to others,\nas we are arguing from only a single instance (viz., ourselves), which\nis an inadequate inductive base on which to reason in this way. In\nresponse, however, it could be argued that unless others appeared to\nus as more than mere bodies, but instead as persons with minds, we\ncould not acquire the capacity to apply mentalistic predicates to\nourselves, and thus become self-conscious. This argument remains\n\u2018modest\u2019 because its transcendental claim extends only to\nhow others must appear to us, and so is not\n\u2018world-directed\u2019 in the manner of more ambitious\ntranscendental arguments; but even so, the idea is, it is still\nsufficient to show that our belief in these other minds is not merely\nbased on a faulty inference in the way that the justificatory sceptic\nsupposes, but rather on the nature of our experience\u2014where as\nsuch, it can therefore be used to show that this belief is warranted,\neven if it could still be false.\n\nNow, none of these approaches is unobjectionable, and it remains to be\nseen which, if any, is to be preferred. Concern about the Aristotelian\napproach can relate to whether it can show that belief in X\nis necessary for intelligible thought in general, or for\nthought by creatures like us\u2014where if it only\nestablishes the latter, the possibility of a sceptic raising\nintelligible doubts about it would seem to remain, while establishing\nthe former seems extremely demanding if not impossible (cf.\nK\u00f6rner 1967). Further, the worry might be raised in a Stroudian\nspirit, that all this approach shows is that doubts cannot be\ncoherently expressed concerning X, but where that then seems\nto fall short of establishing that X is really the case. And\nfinally, while it may perhaps seem right to say that there is\nsomething unintelligible or meaningless about questioning the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (although this can also be challenged:\ncf. Priest 1987), other sceptical doubts do not seem problematic to\nthe same degree. (For further discussion points of this sort, see\nIllies 2003: 54\u201363.) Along similar lines, critics have also\nquestioned Strawson\u2019s naturalistic approach, as not fully\nanswering the sceptical challenge: for even if a doubt here is\n\u2018idle\u2019, it does not follow that what is questioned is\nreally true (cf. Valberg 1992: 168\u201396, Sen 1995). Likewise, when\nit comes to Stroud\u2019s position, as he himself admits, the\nindispensability and invulnerability he speaks of \u2018might not\nseem like much reassurance in the face of a general scepticism\u2019\n(Stroud 1999: 168), given that it not only does not rule out the\npossibility of falsity, but also seemingly gives no additional reasons\nfor taking that possibility less seriously. Moreover, it has been\nsuggested that Stroud\u2019s position is unstable, as the claim that\ncertain beliefs are invulnerable on the one hand, and the acceptance\nthat they might be untrue on the other, seem to stand in tension with\none another (see Brueckner 1996). The position proposed in Stern 2000\ntries to get round these difficulties, but has also been accused of\nducking important aspects of the sceptic\u2019s challenge (see e.g.,\nSacks 1999 and 2000: 276\u201385; and for Sack\u2019s own positive\nproposals, see Sacks 2005a, 2005b and 2006). Finally, for an attempt\nto adopt an approach that is neither ambitious or modest, but\nsomewhere between the two, see McDowell 2006.\n\nWhatever their respective strengths and weaknesses, one thing these\nmodest strategies have suggested is that some of the central features\nof transcendental arguments outlined above do not fit arguments of\nthis less ambitious sort. Thus, these arguments are not\nworld-directed, but are self-, experience-, or belief-directed.\nSecondly, they do not expect the transcendental arguments to refute\nthe sceptic on their own (as it were), but in conjunction with broader\nepistemological or anti-sceptical considerations (such as naturalism,\nor perceptual and other epistemic norms). Thirdly, by offering an\napproach that is more modest, they raise the question of how much\nadequate responses to scepticism are entitled to assume and what kinds\nof reassurance they are meant to provide (cf. Hookway 1999; Cassam\n2007: 51\u201384; Wang 2012). And in all these ways, they have raised\nexegetical issues about how Kant\u2019s place in the canon discussed\nabove might be understood differently, concerning his attitude to\nscepticism and whether in the end his intentions are best interpreted\nin \u2018modest\u2019 or more ambitious terms (cf. Callanan 2006;\nBardon 2006; Stapelford 2008).\n5. Connections to Modal Metaphysics and Epistemology\n\nIn listing key features of transcendental arguments in section 2, it\nwas indicated that metaphysical necessity might be the right\nkind of modality for transcendental arguments, and this brings the\ndiscussion to the realm of modal metaphysics. To begin with, if one is\nsceptical about modality anyway (Quine 1953), then using modality to\nunderstand transcendental arguments is a non-starter. However, if one\nis comfortable with modality in general, it is then a natural way to\nanalyse transcendental arguments. After all, transcendental arguments\ncan be seen as offering certain kind of philosophical\nexplanation\u2014\u2018transcendental explanation\u2019, as\nit is sometimes called\u2014and given this, metaphysical\nexplanations of various sorts are natural candidates. More\nspecifically, with our schema above, we should say that X\ntranscendentally explains the possibility of Y, or more\nsuccinctly, X possibilitates Y, and this relation\nshould be understood with metaphysical modalities. This picture is not\nuniversally shared: some hold that in answering transcendental\nhow-possible questions, identifying the necessary conditions for the\ntargets is explanatorily idle (Cassam 2007).\n\nModal metaphysics is itself a difficult area that involves all kinds\nof sophisticated theories, such as realism, ersatzism, fictionalism,\nto name just a few (see entry on varieties of modality). Fortunately,\nto analyse transcendental arguments with metaphysical modality, there\nis no need to commit to any theory of the nature of metaphysical\nnecessity. In effect, what is more relevant is modal epistemology;\nmore specifically, how one manages to know whether a given modal claim\nis true or not. To see how this is so, let\u2019s use this toy\nexample:\n\nKantian categories are necessary conditions for the possibility of\nobjective cognition.\n\n\nWe will use \u201cKantian categories\u201d as a placeholder for any candidates\nfor being the relevant conditions. To analyse this with metaphysical\nnecessity, this statement can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nIt is metaphysically necessary that if there is objective cognition,\nthen Kantian categories are in place.\n\n\nNow, how do we know, or at least try to figure out, the truth or\nfalsity of such a statement? This is where modal epistemology enters\nthe scene. As with many other areas in philosophy, the territory is\noften divided into rationalism and empiricism, though admittedly such\ndivision can also miss the subtleties among different views. In any\ncase, one major view within the rationalist tradition is the\nconceivability approach (Yablo 1993; Chalmers 1996, 2010).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIt is inconceivable that there is objective cognition without there\nbeing categories in place.\n\n\nThe rationale for this move is that according to such an approach,\nconceivability is a guide to metaphysical possibility, while\ninconceivability is a guide to metaphysical impossibility. Given this,\nif it is metaphysically necessary that if A then B, then it is not\nmetaphysically possible that there is A without B. Now it is natural\nto expect that the difficulties with the conceivability approach will\nthereby translate into this rendering of transcendental arguments, in\nroughly this way: this rendering assumes that inconceivability entails\nmetaphysical impossibility, but such entailment does not hold, because\ninconceivability might just reflect human\u2019s lack of imagination,\nand therefore transcendental arguments are in trouble (Mizrahi 2017).\nWhen Mizrahi makes this claim, he uses Kant\u2019s Refutation of\nIdealism as the prime example, but he intends this point to be applied\nto other transcendental arguments too.\n\nHowever, note that defenders of transcendental arguments have at least\ntwo ways to respond to such a challenge. First, to understand the\ntranscendental conditionals (i.e., claims asserting that the\npossibility of Y requires or presupposes X) as\n(in)conceivability claims is not mandatory. Second, even if we\nunderstand the conditionals this way, there is a weaker version of the\nconceivability approach which holds that (in)conceivability is only a\nguide to (im)possibility, which is obviously much more defensible than\nthe stronger version that involves entailment. To be sure, some might\nfind this version too weak to secure the distinctiveness of certain\narguments being \u2018transcendental.\u2019 If one goes down the\nfirst route, one can opt for other approaches in modal epistemology.\nFor example, another camp of rationalism in this area is the\nessentialist approach (Fine 1995; Lowe 2011, 2012, 2013).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIt is part of the essence of objective cognition that if there is\nobjective cognition, then categories are in place.\n\n\nNow again, this rendering inherits all the problems with such\napproaches, which will not be covered here (see the entry on the\nepistemology of modality). One can then reject rationalism in this\narea and opt for an entirely different camp, for example the\ncounterfactual approach (Williamson, 2005, 2007, 2016).\nAccording to such an approach, knowledge of the above statement about\nmetaphysical necessity is based on knowledge of the following:\n\nIf there were objective cognition without there being categories in\nplace, then there would be a contradiction.\n\n\nor\n\nObjective cognition without categories counterfactually implies a\ncontradiction.\n\n\nThis approach invokes certain notion of \u2018imaginative\nsimulation\u2019 to model the inference, and it is sometimes said\nthat such an exercise is neither a priori nor a\nposteriori, but \u2018armchair\u2019 (Williamson 2013). Whether\nthis threefold distinction is reasonable is controversial, as it is\ngenerally thought that armchair inferences are a priori\ninferences. Now, note that the same dialectic recurs: this rendering\ninherits all the problems with such approach, and one might therefore\nwish to opt for a different analysis (for more on connecting\ntranscendental arguments and counterfactuals, see Kannisto 2020).\n\nThe point of the above discussion is not to present all the approaches\nin modal epistemology; for example, there are other approaches such as\nthe one that invokes analogical inferences (Roca-Royes 2017). There\nare also approaches that might combine several ideas, for example\nHusserl\u2019s \u2018imaginative variation\u2019 that combines\nconceivability and essence (1931/2012). The key message here is that\nif transcendental conditionals can be thought to embody claims about\nmetaphysical modalities, then both considerations from modal\nmetaphysics and modal epistemology\u2014especially the\nlatter\u2014will influence what we should say about such\nconditionals.  Another potential direction is to see whether\nmetaphysical grounding can be an explanation of transcendental\nconditionals (see the entry on metaphysical grounding). Although it\ncan be tempting and potentially enlightening to connect these\ncontemporary approaches to the historical tradition, no claim about a\ndirect historical connection is made here: it should not be\nassumed\u2014without textual analyses anyway\u2014that any above\napproach captures what Kant, Fichte, and other historical figures had\nin mind when they invoked such arguments.\n6. Transcendental Arguments in Ethics\n\nAs we have seen, then, when it comes to transcendental arguments in\nepistemology, most of the effort in recent years has been concentrated\nat the meta-level, concerning what transcendental arguments are and\nwhat they can be expected to achieve: when it comes to examples of\ntranscendental arguments themselves, very few new ones have actually\nbeen proposed (for exceptions, see Lockie 2018, Cheng 2022). However,\nthe picture is different in ethics, where attempts to produce such\narguments are still being made, so that while epistemology perhaps\nremains their natural home, the use of transcendental arguments in\nethics is of undoubted significance (see for example Brune, Stern and\nWerner (eds.) 2017). Moreover, as with such arguments in epistemology,\nwhen it comes to transcendental claims in ethics, Kant may again be\ntaken as an important inspiration, especially Kant 1785.\n\nIn fact, in view of what was said previously regarding the problems of\ntranscendental arguments, it is perhaps not really surprising that\nethicists have had fewer qualms in producing them. For, as we saw, the\ndifficulty when it comes to external world scepticism, other minds\nscepticism, and the like, is in finding an argument that will\nsuccessfully cross Stroud\u2019s \u2018bridge of necessity\u2019,\nand establish a conclusion concerning how things are, rather than how\nthings must appear or how we must believe them to be, and so reach a\nconclusion that will satisfy the realist about such matters. However,\nin ethics, it is much more acceptable to reject realism, and to adopt\na more anti-realist position of some sort at the outset (cf.\nR\u00e4hme 2017); as a result, the most that will be called for is a\nmodest transcendental argument which is not world-directed, as many\nethicists do not want to treat moral values and norms as part of the\n\u2018world\u2019 anyway, and so see no victory for the sceptic in\nfailing to establish any more ambitious conclusion, where this may\nstill be a worry in the epistemological cases.\n\nWhile until recently there was only a limited discussion of\ntranscendental arguments in ethics within the \u2018analytic\u2019\ntradition of Anglo-American philosophy (see e.g., Phillips-Griffiths\n1957\u20138; Watt 1975; Harrison 1976; Cooper 1976; Finnis 1977\nargues for the value of truth), they have played a significant role in\nthe social philosophy of thinkers such as Karl-Otto Apel and\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas (for a broader discussion of transcendental\narguments concerning intersubjectivity in the\n\u2018continental\u2019 tradition more generally, see Chase &\nReynolds 2011: 89\u2013114 and Russell & Reynolds 2011). Apel has\nargued that an ethical perspective is required as a condition for a\ncommitment to truth, inquiry and successful communication. Habermas\ndenies this, where instead he thinks that we are committed to\ncommunication and discourse by the pragmatic implications of speech\noriented towards reaching understanding of each other, which for us,\nas speaking beings, is unavoidable. Both may be said to be inspired by\nC. S. Peirce\u2019s insistence on the relation between truth and\nconsensus, where the search for consensus is said to require as a\nnecessary condition that we have certain ethical attitudes to others,\nsuch as equal respect and tolerance for their views and commitments.\nIn this way the suggestion is also made in the practical case, it is\neasier for transcendental arguments to take a so-called\n\u2018retorsive\u2019 rather than a deductive form, aiming to more\nmodestly show that to make inquiries in this context we simply must\nnot question certain things to make inquiries in this context (See\nApel 1976b vol II/1980 and 1976a; Habermas 1983. For further\ndiscussion see Benhabib and Dallmayr (eds.) 1995; Illies 2003:\n64\u201392 and Kuhlmann 2017. A comparable form of transcendental\nargument is attributed to Emmanuel Levinas in Perpich 2008:\n124\u2013149; For a critical discussion of the value of this approach\nsee Stern 2016).\n\nMoreover, transcendental claims have been given a more prominent role\nwithin recent Anglo-American ethical theory, largely through the work\nof Alan Gewirth and Christine Korsgaard. These arguments start not\nfrom claims about truth and communication, but from claims about our\nnature as human agents, and what we must then presuppose about the\nmoral status of ourselves and others. As in epistemology, the promise\nof such arguments in ethics has generated much interest and attention.\nFor illustration, we will discuss a transcendental argument in ethics\nproposed by Korsgaard. (For Gewirth, see Gewirth 1981; Beyleveld 1991;\nand Illies 2003: 93\u2013128.)\n\nKorsgaard\u2019s use of a transcendental argument in fact forms only\npart of a wider response to sceptical worries about the demands of\nmorality (\u2018the normative question\u2019), and is deployed\nmerely to convince the sceptic that her own humanity has value, from\nwhich a further argument concerning the publicity of reasons is used\nto show that she must also then value the humanity of others. The\ntranscendental argument that Korsgaard proposes is modelled on a\nposition which she finds in Kant and which she outlines as\nfollows:\n\n[Kant] started from the fact that when we make a choice we must regard\nits object as good. His point is the one I have been making\u2014that\nbeing human we must endorse our impulses before we can act on them. He\nasked what it is that makes these objects good, and, rejecting one\nform of realism, he decided that the goodness was not in the objects\nthemselves. Were it not for our desires and inclinations\u2014and for\nthe various physiological, psychological, and social conditions which\ngave rise to those desires and inclinations\u2014we would not find\ntheir objects good. Kant saw that we take things to be important\nbecause they are important to us\u2014and he concluded that we must\ntherefore take ourselves to be important. In this way, the value of\nhumanity itself is implicit in every human choice. If complete\nnormative scepticism is to be avoided\u2014if there is such a thing\nas a reason for action\u2014then humanity, as the source of all\nreasons and values, must be valued for its own sake. (Korsgaard 1996:\n122)\n\n\nThis argument can be laid out as follows:\n\n(1) To rationally\nchoose to do X, you must regard doing X as\ngood.\n(2) You cannot regard\ndoing X as good in itself, but can only regard doing\nX as good because it satisfies your needs, desires,\ninclinations, etc.\n(3) You cannot regard\nyour desiring or needing to do X as making it good unless you\nregard yourself as valuable.\n(4) Therefore, you must\nregard yourself as valuable, if you are to make any rational\nchoice.\n\n\nConsider this example. To rationally choose to eat this piece of\nchocolate cake, I must think that eating the cake is good in some way.\nHow can I regard it as good? It seems implausible to say that eating\nthe cake is good in itself, of intrinsic value. It also seems\nimplausible to say that it is good just because it satisfies a desire\nas such: for even if I was bulimic it might do that, but still not be\nregarded as good. A third suggestion, then, is that it can be seen as\ngood because it is good for me, as satisfying a genuine need or desire\nof mine. But if I think this is what makes eating the piece of cake\ngood, I must value myself, as otherwise I could not hold that\nsatisfying me is sufficient to make something good enough for it to be\nrational for me to choose to do it; so I must regard myself as\nvaluable. Put conversely: suppose that you thought that you and your\nlife were utterly worthless, pointless, meaningless\u2014that in your\neyes, you were valueless. And suppose that you are faced with a piece\nof cake: on what basis would you choose it eat it? It seems unlikely\nthat there is something intrinsically good about eating it, or that\nyou should do so just because you find yourself with a desire to do\nso, even while finding your existence valueless. It seems that the\nonly reason to do so would be if you thought eating the cake brought\nyou some genuine benefit\u2014but if you thought your life was\nworthless, how could you see this as a reason either? Why is bringing\nbenefit to something that in your eyes is so utterly without value a\nreasonable thing to do?\n\nThere are some dangers in this argument, however. One, which Korsgaard\nconsiders, is that it might lead to \u2018self-conceit\u2019\n(Korsgaard 1998: 54. Cf. also Korsgaard 1996: 249\u201350): that is,\nI might conclude from this that I am supremely valuable, simply as\nmyself, which could obviously then get in the way of my ethical\ntreatment of others. But, this worry might be lessened by the thought\nthat while the argument gets me to see that I must find something\nvaluable about me, it need not be anything about me in particular, and\nperhaps could instead be something about me that is more\ngeneral\u2014such as my humanity or personhood. However, while\nKorsgaard says that reflection will indeed lead us in this more\ngeneral direction, we will need to see how. A second, perhaps related,\nworry is that this argument has a troubling parallel in the case of\nSatan, where Satan goes through (1) to (4) above, and concludes that\nhe must regard his devilish nature as valuable. If this argument\nsomehow entitles us to regard our own humanity or personhood as\nvaluable, why doesn\u2019t it entitle Satan to think the same about\nhis nature? This is not the same as self-conceit, because he is not\nvaluing himself as Satan just qua Satan; he is valuing his\nnature, just as we are valuing ours. Nor does devilishness seem any\nless central to his nature than humanity is to ours. So it is hard to\nsee how the Satanic parallel can be avoided by the argument as it\nstands.\n\nNonetheless, it is possible that something can be built on the central\nidea of the argument, which seems to be this: As long as we think we\ncan act for reasons based on the value of things, but at the same time\nreject any realism about that value applying to things independently\nof us, then we must be treated as the source of value and in a way\nthat makes rational choice possible. We can therefore see\nKorsgaard\u2019s second argument as attempting something along these\nlines, using her notion of practical identity to perhaps avoid the two\nproblems we have identified with the Kantian argument.\n\nHere, then, is an outline of Korsgaard\u2019s second argument:\n\n(1) To rationally\nchoose to do X, you must take it that doing X is the\nrational thing to do.\n(2) Since there is no\nreason in itself to do X, you can take it that X is\nthe rational thing to do only if you regard your practical identity as\nmaking X the rational thing to do.\n(3) You cannot regard\nyour practical identity as making doing X the rational thing\nto do unless you can see some value in that practical\nidentity.\n(4) You cannot see any\nvalue in any particular practical identity as such, but can regard it\nas valuable only because of the contribution it makes to giving you\nreasons and values by which to live.\n(5) You cannot see\nhaving a practical identity as valuable in this way unless you think\nyour having a life containing reasons and values is\nimportant.\n(6) You cannot regard\nit as important that your life contain reasons and values unless you\nregard your leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable.\n(7) You cannot regard\nyour leading a rationally structured life as valuable unless you value\nyourself qua rational agent.\n(8) Therefore, you must\nvalue yourself qua rational agent, if you are to make any\nrational choice.\n\n\nThe first step is now familiar: To act is to do or choose something\nfor a reason that may be conscious or uncomscious. The second step is\nbased on Korsgaard\u2019s idea that we have reasons to act because of\nour practical identities (such as one\u2019s identity as a father, or\nlecturer, or Englishman), not because acts have reasons attached to\nthem in themselves. Once again, realists might demur, claiming that\nsome actions are rational things to do, because some things have value\nas such: so, perhaps knowledge is valuable in itself, thereby making\nit rational to seek it. But let us leave such worries aside and assume\nwith Korsgaard that nothing is objectively rational for us to do.\n\nThe third step asks how a practical identity can make something into a\nreason for an agent: how can the fact that I am a father make it\nrational for me to buy my daughter this toy? The thought here is that\nit can only do so if you see value in that identity. Korsgaard\nstresses this when she writes:\n\nThe conception of one\u2019s identity in question here is not a\ntheoretical one, a view about what as a matter of inescapable\nscientific fact you are. It is better understood as a description\nunder which you value yourself, a description under which you find\nyour life to be worth living and your actions to be worth undertaking.\n(Korsgaard 1996: 101)\n\n\nSo, being a father, whether contingently or essentially, gives one no\nreason to be a caring or devoted father of a sort that would have good\nreason to buy a daughter a gift; rather, valuing one\u2019s\nfatherhood does this.\n\nBut (moving on to step (4)), how can I see my particular practical\nidentity as valuable? Korsgaard\u2019s position here is that I cannot\nsee any value in any particular practical identity as such: for, to do\nso would mean being committed to realism, to thinking that being a\nfather, an Englishman, a university lecturer or whatever matters as\nsuch; or (in a way that is in the end equally realist), it matters\nbecause of the intrinsically valuable things it leads you to do. But,\nKorsgaard takes such realist positions to be problematic, and so\nthinks this will not do as an answer.\n\nSo suppose we allow that no particular practical identity can be seen\nto have value in itself; Korsgaard then offers as the only remaining\nexplanation of its value to the agent that has that identity, that\nsuch identities have the general capacity of enabling the agent to\nlive a life containing reasons: because I have whatever particular\npractical identities I do (father, Englishman, university\nlecturer\u2026), I can then find things to be valuable and act\nrationally accordingly, in a way that gives me unity as a subject.\n\nBut then (step (5)), to think that this makes having some sort of\nparticular practical identity important, you must think that it\nmatters that your life have the sort of rational structure that having\nsuch identities provides; but (step (6)), to see that as mattering,\nyou must see value in your leading a rationally structured life. And\nthen, finally, to see value in your leading such a life, you must see\nyour rational nature as valuable, which is to value your humanity.\n\nDoes this Korsgaardian argument avoid the pitfalls of the Kantian one\ndiscussed earlier? It seems to avoid the problem of self-conceit,\nbecause it does seem that what you end up valuing is not yourself\nsimply as such, but yourself qua rational agent. And as\npresented here, it avoids the problem of the Satanic parallel, because\nall it shows is that Satan must value his rational nature, not his\ndevilishness.\n\nFor both these problems to be avoided, however, it is important to run\nthe argument as outlined above, not as it is sometimes presented by\nKorsgaard, which is via the notion of need (cf. Korsgaard 1996: 121\nand 125). This would follow the same premises as before for\n(1)\u2013(5), and then go as follows:\n\n(6*)  You cannot regard\nit as important that your life contain reasons and values unless you\ntake your need to lead this sort of life as important.\n(7*) You cannot take\nthis need to be important unless you take yourself to be\nvaluable.\n(8*) Therefore, you\nmust value yourself, if you are to make any rational\nchoice.\n\n\nThe difficulty with (6*)\u2013(8*), we think, is that (8*) does not\nstipulate what it is about yourself that you are required to value, so\nthat this could be my sheer particularity (self-conceit), or if I am\nnot in fact human, my non-human nature (Satan). This is because (6*)\njust identifies a need, and says that this need could not be important\nunless the agent who has the need were seen to be valuable\nsomehow\u2014whereas the previous argument narrows value down to\nrational agency, and so rules out both self-conceit and\ndevilishness.\n\nWe have therefore reconstructed that part of Korsgaard\u2019s\nstrategy who offers an argument to the effect that you must value\nyour humanity, as a transcendental argument: it is transcendental as\nit claims that valuing humanity is a necessary condition of being an\nagent which makes rational choice. It turns out that if it is to be\nmade plausible in this way, a lot depends on accepting\nKorsgaard\u2019s arguments against realism; but then, as we have\nseen, many have always suspected that some commitment to anti-realism\nis required to make a transcendental argument convincing. A further\nworry when it comes to external world scepticism, as we discussed\nabove\n (\u00a73),\n is that this commitment can appear to make the argument redundant,\nbecause anti-realism appears sufficient as a response to scepticism on\nits own. However, in this ethical case, this worry is perhaps less of\na concern, because a sceptic could endorse an anti-realist position in\nmetaethics, without accepting that they or others have value as a\nmatter of their normative ethics, so that there is still work left for\nthe transcendental argument to do. To this extent, therefore, it is\nnot surprising that Korsgaard\u2019s claims have given further\nimpetus to the debate concerning what transcendental arguments are,\nand what they can contribute. (For further discussion of\nKorsgaard\u2019s position as an interpretation of Kant, see Wood\n1999: 125\u201332 and Timmermann 2006; and for further discussion,\nsee Skorupski 1998, Skidmore 2002, Enoch 2006, Stern 2011, Stern and\nWatts 2019).\n7. Transcendental Arguments in Philosophy of Psychology and Perception\n\nIn addition to ethics, transcendental arguments are also widely use in\nother areas of philosophy. There are certain prominent examples in\nphilosophy of psychology and perception. For the former, one idea is\nthat the possibility of intentional action requires or presupposes the\nsubject\u2019s sensation-based bodily awareness (O\u2019Shaughnessy\n1980, 1989, 1995; Berm\u00fadez 1995). This general idea has been\ncashed out in different ways. One such instance begins with the fact\nthat we do perceive and act upon the world, and proceeds with the\ninference that the possibility of guiding actions via our\nperceptions of the world requires or presupposes spatial awareness of\nour bodily positions. Although here the starting point concerns\nperception in general, it is standard to think of these inferences\nfrom some examples of vision: our visual experiences of worldly\nobjects enable us to act upon those objects only if the subjects are\ncapable of mapping the information that they give about the spatial\nrelations between our bodies and the objects in question. Another\ninstance begins with the fact that we do experiences ourselves as\nperforming bodily-directed intentional actions. This can be motivated\nby considering simple examples such as scratching one\u2019s head. To\ndo this, it is not enough to locate the spot on one\u2019s head where\none wishes to scratch. It is also needed to be able to locate that\nspot relative to the rest of one\u2019s body. That is, the\npossibility of the above experiences requires or presupposes certain\nkind of representational awareness of one\u2019s body. Some might\neven go further to hold that one needs to be aware of that spot as\npart of one\u2019s body. Why is this so? The idea is that one\nnormally scratches the spot with one\u2019s hand, and in moving the\nhand to the location of the spot, it seems necessary to holistically\nrepresent one\u2019s body, otherwise one would not be able to direct\none\u2019s hand to the spot smoothly.\n\nOne distinctive feature of these arguments is that they seem to make\nempirical claims about the world, so the status of such arguments can\nbecome a matter of dispute. It is often thought that transcendental\narguments, or at least the conditionals involved, have to be a\npriori (Berm\u00fadez 1995; Schwenkler 2012), but if they can\nbe tested through cases in real life, specifically clinical cases from\nneuropsychology, it is then become unclear whether such conditionals\nare indeed a priori. Ian Waterman\u2019s case might be the\nmost discussed one in this context. He unfortunately lost all\nfunctions on the large myelinated sensory fibers below the neck, and\nas a result he almost had no sensation below the neck (Cole 1991). At\nthe beginning of such a condition, he could barely move without\nfalling on the ground, but after appropriate training, he became able\nto retrieve some capacities for walking and other actions through the\nhelp of sight. Now why is this relevant? Recall that the first\ntranscendental conditional introduced in this section has it that the\npossibility of guiding actions via our perceptions of the\nworld requires or presupposes spatial awareness of our bodily\npositions. After training, Waterman could guide his actions\nvia his visual experiences of the environment, but this does\nnot seem to require or presuppose the relevant kind of spatial\nawareness of our bodily positions. If so, then the conditional is\nfalsified. As for the second transcendental conditional above, it\nstates that the possibility of experiencing ourselves as performing\nbody-directed intentional actions requires or presupposes certain kind\nof representational awareness of one\u2019s body. Now the partly\nrecovered Waterman could experience himself as performing\nbody-directed intentional actions, but this does not seem to require\nor presuppose the relevant kind of representational awareness of\none\u2019s body, since he is now relying on his sight, not his body\nimage or schema. In this way, cases from neuropsychology might bear on\ntranscendental conditionals.\n\nBut doesn\u2019t this make the relevant conditionals a\nposteriori? After all, they can be falsified by empirical facts\nin the actual world. For those who insist that such conditionals are\na priori, they might argue that since those conditionals are\na priori necessary truths, they are true of all possible\nworlds, including the actual world; no wonder empirical cases in the\nactual world can be relevant. This involves very complicated issues:\ntrue logical and mathematical statements are supposed to be true of\nall possible worlds, including the actual world, but they cannot be\nrefuted by empirical cases in the actual world. This links back to\nconsiderations about modal metaphysics (see \u00a75 above), and about\nphilosophy of language and epistemology too. Note that this issue is\nconnected to another important issue concerning naturalisation\n(Berm\u00fadez 1995): to bring transcendental conditionals to bear\non actual cases is supposed to be a virtue, because it fits the\ncurrent Zeitgeist, but given the empirical bearings, how can\nsuch conditionals be a priori? It is not clear that the\nliterature has engaged with this issue sufficiently. In a way, a\npriori statements bear on the empirical world: e.g., \u2018any\nsister is a sibling\u2019 bears on all sisters; however, this a\npriori statement cannot be refuted by empirical investigations of\nthese individuals in the empirical world.\n\nPhilosophy of perception is another area that is filled with\ntranscendental arguments, even though the users sometimes do not label\nthem as such. For example, consider the view that the possibility of\nintentionality requires or presupposes that perceptual experiences\nhave representational contents (McDowell 2008, against Travis, 2004,\n2018; the \u2018content view\u2019 as it is sometimes called). The\nsub-arguments for such conditionals can be very complicated. It might\nrely on the idea that rational relations must be between contentful\nepisodes, otherwise one might commit the notorious \u2018myth of the\ngiven\u2019 (Sellars 1956). Such pictures can demand an even stronger\nconditional, that the possibility of intentionality requires or\npresupposes that perceptual experiences\u2019 representational\ncontents are all conceptual (McDowell 1996). Relatedly, it is also\nproposed that the possibility of intentionality requires or\npresupposes the \u2018disjunctive conception of perceptual\nevidence\u2019 (McDowell 1982, 1995, 2008). If the force of\ntranscendental arguments is in doubt, then many arguments in\nphilosophy of perception would be problematic. (For more on McDowell,\nsee Cheng 2021b). To be sure, there can always be disagreements about\nwhether these arguments are transcendental at all. To settle this, one\nneeds to check whether these arguments fit the six characteristics\nlisted in section 2. However, one difficulty is that it is unclear\nwhether we should take them as individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient. Another difficulty is that other practitioners would\npresumably disagree with some of the characteristics listed above.\nHere we regard the above examples as transcendental arguments\nprimarily because they fit the schema offered at the beginning of this\nentry, but the relations between these arguments and the\ncharacteristics listed in section 2 are of course complicated and\ncontroversial.\n\nIn addition to the above examples, there are some notable recent\ndevelopments in this area. One prominent theory in this area is\nna\u00efve realism, the view that the phenomenal characters of\nperceptual experiences are partially constituted by their objects\n(Campbell 2002; Martin 2006). As such, it is not obviously\ntranscendental in any sense. However, there is a recent twist that\nbuilds the transcendental element into the theory: according to this\nnew version, na\u00efve realism is an integral part of the\ntranscendental project of explaining how it is possible that\nperceptual experiences have the distinctive characters that they do.\nThat is, na\u00efve realism is not only the best explanation of the\nrelevant phenomenal characters; it is the only viable\nexplanation for why certain perceptual experiences have the kind of\nphenomenal characters they do (Allen 2017, 2020). Another recent\nexample concerns the relation between perceptual experiences and\nimaginative reflection on the phenomenal characters of such\nexperiences (Gomes 2017): more specifically, imaginative\nreflection \u2018draws on the knowledge we possess of the\nphenomenal character of our perceptual experience and exploits various\nof our imaginative and reflective capacities to provide us with\nsupport for modal claims about whether certain non-actual types of\nperceptual experience could support various forms of thought\u2019\n(p. 140). In this context, it is crucial to emphasise that\ntranscendental arguments can at best reveal properties that perceptual\nexperiences must have, or must lack, given the modal\nforce of such arguments. For example, one might think that visual\nexperiences must have a field-like structure, as visual objects need\nto be placed within an overarching space. This specific claim, to be\nsure, has proven to be highly contested (Campbell 2007; Schwenkler\n2012; French 2018; Cheng 2019).\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\nWe have looked in some depth at the role of transcendental arguments\nthat have been given in philosophy, not only in refuting the\nepistemological sceptic, but also in ethics, philosophy of psychology,\nand philosophy of perception. As we have seen, such arguments clearly\nface challenges, both in their details but also at a more general\nlevel, concerning how much they can ever hope to achieve. However,\nwhile these challenges are certainly significant, it would be wrong to\nexaggerate them: for, as we have also seen, the range of potential\nuses for such arguments is wide, while it seems that their intriguing\npower, as well as their alluring promise, will mean that philosophers\nwill continue to be drawn to them. As a result, therefore, it seems\nunlikely that those engaged in the subject will ever cease to feel\nthat \u2018tenderness for transcendental arguments\u2019 (Strawson\n1985: 21) instilled in them by Kant and others.\n",
