    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || On Liberty and Freedom of Speech\n4.5 On Liberty and Freedom of Speech\n\nThe transformation of society from aristocratic to increasingly\ndemocratic forms of organization brought with it opportunities, then.\nBut it also presented dangers. It meant rule by a social mass which\nwas more powerful, uniform, and omnipresent than the sovereigns of\nprevious eras. The dominance of the majority, Mill held, presented new\nthreats of tyranny over the individual\u2014freedom was no less at\nrisk from a newly empowered many, than from an absolute monarch. The\nrestrictions over freedom that concerned Mill included, to be sure,\nlegislatively enacted restrictions of liberty\u2014but they also took\nin broader \u201ccompulsion and control, whether the means used be\nphysical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion\nof public opinion\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 223). Informal\nmechanisms of social pressure and expectation could, in mass\ndemocratic societies, be all-controlling. Mill worried that the\nexercise of such powers would lead to stifling conformism in thought,\ncharacter and action.\n\nIt was in this context that On Liberty was written (Scarre\n2007: 1\u20139). The aim of the argument is announced in the first\nchapter:\n\n\nThe object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle\n[\u2026] That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are\nwarranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the\nliberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.\n(Liberty, XVIII: 223)\n\n\nAs with all of Mill\u2019s practical philosophy, the argument for\nthis claim is utilitarian. \n\n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing\nindependent of utility. (Liberty, XVIII: 224) \n\n\nIt could not be known a priori that we should organize\nsociety along liberal principles. Indeed, Mill held conditions of\nfreedom are only desirable in civilized societies\u2014\u201c[u]ntil\nthen, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or\na Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 224). Mill\u2019s case for liberty, in this\nsense, is based on observation about the conditions under which human\nbeings flourish and are happy.\n\nMill\u2019s claim that On Liberty presents \u201cone very\nsimple principle\u201d\u2014is \u201ca kind of philosophic\ntext-book of a single truth\u201d\u2014perhaps belies the fact that\nthere are many distinct arguments and conclusions drawn throughout the\ntext (Liberty, XVIII: 223; Autobiography, I: 259).\nMill employs different strategies to argue for freedom of thought and\ndiscussion, freedom of character, and freedom of action\u2014and\nalthough of course such arguments overlap, they must be carefully\nunpicked if we are to appreciate their strengths and weaknesses. In\nthis section, we will consider the argument for freedom of speech,\nturning, in the next section, to his case for freedom of character and\naction more broadly.\n\nMill\u2019s argument for the freedom of thought and discussion is\ngiven in chapter 2 of On Liberty, and in it he aims to show\nthat there should be no attempt \u201cto control the expression of\nopinion\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 229; see Riley 2015: 74ff.).\nThe chapter takes the form of a proof from the exhaustion of cases.\nMill claims that, for any opinion P which is a candidate for\nsuppression, P must be either: (i) true, (ii) false, or (iii)\npartially true. Whichever is the case, he argues, P\u2019s\nassertion will be useful for discovering and maintaining the\ntruth\u2014and as such should be welcome. \n\nTrue beliefs are in general suppressed because, though they are true,\nthey are thought to be false. To assume that because one\nthinks a view is false, it should be suppressed, Mill argues, is to\nassume infallibility for one\u2019s beliefs. Human beings, though,\nare not creatures capable of infallible knowledge. Mill\u2019s\nempiricism leads him to believe that we do not have direct a\npriori insight into the truth, and that all of our beliefs must\nremain open to revision in light of further observation. As such,\ndiscussion must remain open\u2014even on issues which we think\nsecurely established. It might be argued, he observes, that certain\ntrue beliefs should be suppressed because, although true, they are\nthought to be harmful. But to argue that we should suppress a\nview because it is harmful would either be to assume infallibility on\nits status as harmful, or to allow debate on that\nquestion\u2014which in turn must involve debate on the substantive\nissue itself. Opinions belonging to case (i) therefore ought to not to\nbe suppressed.\n\nEven when a belief is false, Mill holds, its assertion may\nstill be conducive to securing the truth\u2014and as such, opinions\nbelonging to case (ii) should not be suppressed. The assertion of\nfalse opinions leads to debate\u2014which in turn leads to greater\nunderstanding. Without active defence of a truth, we risk losing sense\nof its real meaning, with genuine knowledge becoming reduced to\n\u201cphrases retained by rote\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 249).\nIt is therefore just as important to hear counterarguments to the\ntruth as its re-articulation.\n\n\nHowever unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the\npossibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the\nconsideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully,\nfrequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma,\nnot a living truth. (Liberty, XVIII: 243)\n\n\nMill holds that \n\n\nthere is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting\ndoctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the\ntruth between them. (Liberty, XVIII: 252) \n\n\nSuch situations make up case (iii). In complicated\nmatters\u2014especially in matter of politics of morality\u2014the\ntruth is \u201cmany-sided\u201d (Letter to Thomas Carlyle\nXII: 181). Most well-thought-out views\u2014whether conservative or\nliberal\u2014on such matters contain part of the truth.\nIndividuals are rarely in the position to see the \u201cwhole\ntruth\u201d for themselves, and the only way for it to emerge is by\ntherefore by \u201cthe reconciling and combining of opposites\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 258, 254).\n\nMill takes the three cases to be exhaustive: whatever an\nopinion\u2019s status in terms of truth, then, its suppression would\nbe epistemically damaging (Skorupski 1989: 377\u201383). The\nargument\u2019s focus on truth, of course, limits the scope\nof the argument. Though there may be arguments establishing that forms\nof communication which do not have truth as their goal\u2014poetry,\nart, music\u2014should be free from interference, these are not to be\nfound in chapter 2, but later in On Liberty.\n",
