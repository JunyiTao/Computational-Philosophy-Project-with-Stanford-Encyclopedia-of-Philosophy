    "main_text": "Basic Orientations in Environmental Aesthetics || Non-cognitive Views\n3.2 Non-cognitive Views\n\nStanding in contrast to the cognitive positions in environmental\naesthetics are several so-called non-cognitive, non-conceptual, or\nambient approaches. However, \u201cnon-cognitive\u201d here should\nnot be taken in its older philosophical sense, as meaning primarily or\nonly \u201cemotive\u201d. Rather it indicates simply that these\nviews hold that something other than a cognitive component, such as\nscientific knowledge or cultural tradition, is the central feature of\nthe aesthetic appreciation of environments. The leading non-cognitive\napproach, called the aesthetics of engagement, draws on phenomenology\nas well as on analytic aesthetics. In doing so, it rejects many of the\ntraditional ideas about aesthetic appreciation not only for nature but\nalso for art. It argues that the theory of disinterestedness involves\na mistaken analysis of the concept of the aesthetic and that this is\nmost evident in the aesthetic experience of natural environments.\nAccording to the engagement approach, disinterested appreciation, with\nits isolating, distancing, and objectifying gaze, is out of place in\nthe aesthetic experience of nature, for it wrongly abstracts both\nnatural objects and appreciators from the environments in which they\nproperly belong and in which appropriate appreciation is achieved.\nThus, the aesthetics of engagement stresses the contextual dimensions\nof nature and our multi-sensory experiences of it. Viewing the\nenvironment as a seamless unity of places, organisms, and perceptions,\nit challenges the importance of traditional dichotomies, such as that\nbetween subject and object. It beckons appreciators to immerse\nthemselves in the natural environment and to reduce to as small a\ndegree as possible the distance between themselves and the natural\nworld. In short, appropriate aesthetic experience is held to involve\nthe total immersion of the appreciator in the object of appreciation\n(Berleant 1985 1988 1992 2013b).\n\nOther non-cognitive positions in environmental aesthetics contend that\ndimensions other than engagement are central to aesthetic experience.\nWhat is known as the arousal model holds that we may appreciate nature\nsimply by opening ourselves to it and being emotionally aroused by it.\nOn this view, this less intellectual, more visceral experience of\nnature constitutes a legitimate way of aesthetically appreciating it\nthat does not require any knowledge gained from science or elsewhere\n(Carroll 1993). Another alternative similarly argues that neither\nscientific nor any other kind of knowledge facilitates real,\nappropriate appreciation of nature, but not because such appreciation\nneed involve only emotional arousal, but rather because nature itself\nis essentially alien, aloof, distant, and unknowable. This position,\nwhich may be called the mystery model, contends that appropriate\nexperience of nature incorporates a sense of being separate from\nnature and of not belonging to it\u2014a sense of mystery involving a\nstate of appreciative incomprehension (Godlovitch 1994). A fourth\nnon-cognitive approach brings together several features thought to be\nrelevant to nature appreciation. It attempts to balance engagement and\nthe traditional idea of disinterestedness, while giving center stage\nto imagination. This approach distinguishes a number of different\nkinds of imagination\u2014associative, metaphorical, exploratory,\nprojective, ampliative, and revelatory. It also responds to concerns\nthat imagination introduces subjectivity by appealing to factors such\nas guidance by the object of appreciation, the constraining role of\ndisinterestedness, and the notion of \u201cimagining well\u201d\n(Brady 1998 2003). A related point of view, which stresses the\nmetaphysical dimensions of imagination, might also be placed in the\nnon-cognitive group, although doing so requires making certain\nassumptions about the cognitive content of metaphysical speculation.\nAccording to this account, the imagination interprets nature as\nrevealing metaphysical insights: insights about things such as the\nmeaning of life, the human condition, or our place in the cosmos.\nThus, this point of view includes within appropriate aesthetic\nexperience of nature those abstract meditations and ruminations about\nultimate reality that our encounters with nature sometimes engender\n(Hepburn 1996).\n",
