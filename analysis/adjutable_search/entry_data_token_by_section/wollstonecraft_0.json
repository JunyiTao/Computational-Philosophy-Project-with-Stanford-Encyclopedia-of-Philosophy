    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nThe second of seven children, Mary Wollstonecraft was born in\nSpitalfields, London, on 27 April 1759, in a house on Primrose Street.\nHer paternal grandfather was a successful master weaver who left a\nsizeable legacy, but her father, Edward John, mismanaged his share of\nthe inheritance. He tried to establish himself as a gentleman farmer\nin Epping. This was the first of the family\u2019s several moves, each of\nwhich marked its financial and social decline. Only Mary\u2019s brother,\nEdward (Ned), was to receive a formal education; he became a lawyer.\nHe had also inherited directly from his grandfather a substantial part\nof the latter\u2019s legacy.\n\nWollstonecraft\u2019s own somewhat haphazard education was, however, not\nentirely unusual for someone of her sex and position, nor was it\nparticularly deficient. Her published writings show her to have\nacquired a true command of the Bible and a good knowledge of the works\nof several of the most famous Ancient philosophers. The latter is\npartly explained through her personal acquaintance with Thomas Taylor,\nfamed for his translations of Plato (Tomaselli 2019). She also drew on a variety of\nearly modern sources, such as Shakespeare and Milton\u2019s works. Through\nher own writing for the Analytical Review she was to become\nwidely read in the literature of her period. Initially, the nature and\nextent of her reading was partly owed to the friendship shown to her\nin her youth by a retired clergyman and his wife. Nevertheless, as a\nwoman from an impecunious family, her prospects were very limited. In\nrelatively rapid succession, she was to enter the most likely\noccupations for someone of her sex and circumstances: a lady\u2019s\ncompanion, a schoolteacher, and a governess.\n\nIn 1778, she was engaged as a companion to a Mrs Dawson and lived at\nBath. She returned home to nurse her ailing mother in the latter part\nof 1781. After Mrs Wollstonecraft\u2019s death, in the spring of 1782, Mary\nlived with the Bloods, the impoverished family of her dearest friend,\nFanny. In the winter of 1783, Mary left them in order to attend to her\nsister Eliza and her newly born daughter. There followed the first of\nthe emotionally very difficult episodes in Mary\u2019s life. What prompted\nMary to intervene as decisively as she did in her sister\u2019s marriage\nremains somewhat of a mystery; but in the course of January 1784, Mary\ntook her sister away, and the two women went into hiding, leaving\nEliza\u2019s infant daughter behind; the baby died the following\nAugust.\n\nBy February of that year, the two sisters had already been planning to\nestablish a school with Fanny Blood. Mary\u2019s other sister, Everina,\njoined in the project a little later. They first set their sights on\nIslington, then moved to Newington Green, where Mary met the moral and\npolitical thinker, the Reverend Richard Price, head of Newington\u2019s\nthriving Dissenting community, and heard him preach. This was a\ncrucial encounter for Mary. Several years later, she was to rise to\nhis defence in a Vindication of the Rights of Men\n(1790), and it was through her connections to members of this\ncommunity that she was to gain an introduction to her future\npublisher, friend, and one might even say, patron, Joseph Johnson.\n\nIn November 1785, Wollstonecraft set off on a trip to Lisbon, where\nher friend Fanny, who had married that February, was expecting her\nfirst child. On board the ship, Mary met a man suffering from\nconsumption; she nursed him for a fortnight, the length of the\njourney. This experience is related in her first novel, Mary, a\nFiction (1788). She gained a very unfavourable opinion of\nPortuguese life and society, which seemed to her ruled by\nirrationality and superstitions. Mary\u2019s brief stay in Portugal was,\nfurthermore, to be a profoundly unhappy one, for both Fanny and her\nbaby died shortly after the delivery.\n\nOn her return to England, Wollstonecraft found her school in a dire\nstate. Far from providing her with a reliable income and some\nstability, it was to be a source of endless worries and a financial\ndrain. Only Joseph Johnson\u2019s advance on her first\nbook, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters: with Reflections on\nFemale Conduct in the more important Duties of Life (1787) helped\nease her considerable financial difficulties. It consists of brief\ndiscussions on such topics as \u2018Moral Discipline\u2019,\n\u2018Artificial Manners\u2019, \u2018Boardings-Schools\u2019,\n\u2018The Benefits Which Arise From Disappointments\u2019,\n\u2018The Observance of Sunday\u2019, and \u2018On the Treatment of\nServants\u2019. Although it might seem somewhat cursory, this book\nserved as the groundwork for many of the topics to which she would\nreturn in her more famous works of the 1790s.\n\nFollowing the collapse of her school, Wollstonecraft became a\ngoverness to the family of Lord Kingsborough for a brief and\nunsatisfactory period. The position took her to Ireland, where she\ncompleted Mary, A Fiction. On her return to London, Joseph\nJohnson came to the rescue once again by giving her some literary\nemployment. In 1787, she also began, but never completed, The Cave\nof Fancy. A Tale. The same year, she wrote Original Stories\nfrom Real Life; with Conversations, calculated to Regulate the\nAffections, and Form the Mind to Truth and Goodness (1788); it\nappeared in two other London editions in her life time (1791 and\n1796), the last of which illustrated by William Blake.\nWollstonecraft\u2019s anthology, The Female Reader; Miscellaneous\nPieces in Prose and Verse; Selected from the Best Writers and Disposed\nunder Proper Heads; for the Improvement of Young Women (1789),\nwas compiled in the same period and published under the name of\n\u2018Mr. Cresswick, teacher of Elocution\u2019; it pursues themes\nto be found in her previous works and contains excerpts mostly from\nthe Bible and Shakespeare\u2019s plays, as well as many by various\neighteenth-century authors, such as Voltaire, Hume, Steele, Charlotte\nSmith, and Madame de Genlis.\n\nTo understand the extent to which Wollstonecraft made up for the lack\nof a formal education, it is essential to appreciate fully that her\ntalents were to extend to translating and reviewing, and that these\ntwo activities, quite apart from her own intellectual curiosity,\nacquainted her with a great many authors, including Leibniz and Kant.\nShe translated into English Jacques Necker\u2019s Of the Importance of\nReligious Opinions (1788) from French, Rev. C. G. Salzmann\u2019s \nElements of Morality, for the Use of Children; with an Introductory\nAddress to Parents (1790) from German, and Madame de Cambon\u2019s\nYoung Grandison (1790) from Dutch. In each case, the texts\nshe produced were almost as if her own, not just because she was in\nagreement with their original authors, but because she more or less\nre-wrote them. The Reverend Salzmann is unlikely to have resented her\nfor this, as he was to translate into German both A Vindication of\nthe Rights of Woman and William Godwin\u2019s Memoirs of the\nAuthor of a Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798).\n\nThroughout the period covered by these translations Wollstonecraft\nwrote for the Analytical Review, which her publisher, Joseph\nJohnson, together with Thomas Christie, started in May 1788. She was\ninvolved with this publication either as a reviewer or as editorial\nassistant for most of its relatively short life. Despite her own\npractice of the genre, her many reviews reveal the degree to which,\nshe, like many other moralists in the eighteenth century, feared the\nmoral consequences of reading novels. She believed that even those of\na relatively superior quality encouraged vanity and selfishness. She\nwas to concede, however, that reading such works might nonetheless be\nbetter than not reading at all. Besides novels, Wollstonecraft\nreviewed poetry, travel accounts, educational works, collected\nsermons, biographies, natural histories, and essays and treatises on\nsubjects such as Shakespeare, happiness, theology, music, architecture\nand the awfulness of solitary confinement; the authors whose works she\ncommented on included Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Emanuel Swedenborg, Lord\nKames, Rousseau, and William Smellie. Until the end of 1789, her\narticles were mostly of a moral and aesthetic nature. However, in\nDecember 1789, she reviewed a speech by her old friend, Richard Price,\nentitled A Discourse on the Love of our Country, delivered on Nov.\n4, 1789, at the Meeting-House in the Old Jewry, to the Society for\nCommemorating the Revolution of Great Britain. With an Appendix,\ncontaining the report of the Committee of the Society; and Account of\nthe Population of France; and the Declarations of the Rights by the\nNational Assembly of France (1789). This address to the\nRevolution Society in commemoration of the events of 1688 partly\nprompted Burke to compose his famous Reflections on the\nRevolution in France, and on the Proceedings in Certain Societies in\nLondon Relative to that Event (1790).\n\nBurke\u2019s attack on Price in that work in turn led Wollstonecraft, egged\non by her publisher, Johnson, to take up her pen in the aged\nReverend\u2019s defence. A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790)\nwas almost certainly the first of many responses Burke\u2019s\nReflections elicited. Initially published\nanonymously at the end of November, the second edition that quickly\nfollowed in mid-December bore its author\u2019s name and marked a turning\npoint in her career; it established her as a political writer. In\nSeptember 1791, Wollstonecraft began A Vindication of the Rights\nof Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects, which\nelaborated a number of points made in the previous\nVindication, namely, that in most cases, marriage was nothing\nbut a property relation, and that the education women received ensured\nthat they could not meet the expectations society had of them and\nalmost certainly guaranteed them an unhappy life.\n\nFollowing the publication of her second Vindication,\nWollstonecraft was introduced to the French statesman and diplomat,\nCharles Talleyrand, on his mission to London on the part of the\nConstituent Assembly in February 1792. She dedicated the second\nedition of the A Vindication of the Rights of Woman to him.\nIn December 1792, she travelled to France where she met Gilbert Imlay,\nan American merchant and author of A Topographical Descriptions of\nthe Western Territory of North America (1792) and The\nEmigrants (1793). As British subjects were increasingly at risk\nunder the Terror, Wollstonecraft passed as Imlay\u2019s wife so as to\nbenefit from the security enjoyed at the time by American citizens.\nThey never married. Imlay was probably the source of Wollstonecraft\u2019s\ngreatest unhappiness, first through his lack of ardour for her, then\nbecause of his infidelity, and finally because of his complete\nrejection of her. Most of all, her love of Imlay brought\nWollstonecraft to the realisation that the passions are not so easily\nbrought to heel by reason.\n\nWollstonecraft had a girl by Imlay. She was born at Le Havre in May\n1794 and named Fanny, after Wollstonecraft\u2019s friend, Fanny Blood. A\nyear after Fanny\u2019s birth, Wollstonecraft twice attempted suicide,\nfirst in May, then in October 1795. She broke with Imlay finally in\nMarch 1796. In April of the same year, she renewed her acquaintance\nwith William Godwin and they became lovers that summer. They were\nmarried at St Pancras church in March 1797. On the 30th\nAugust, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, future author of\nFrankenstein and wife of Shelley, was born.\n",
