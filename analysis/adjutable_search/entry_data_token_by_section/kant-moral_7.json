    "main_text": "The Kingdom of Ends Formula\n8. The Kingdom of Ends Formula\n\nThis formulation has gained favor among Kantians in recent years (see\nRawls, 1971; Hill, 1972). Many see it as introducing more of a social\ndimension to Kantian morality. Kant states that the above concept of\nevery rational will as a will that must regard itself as enacting laws\nbinding all rational wills is closely connected to another concept,\nthat of a \u201csystematic union of different rational beings under\ncommon laws\u201d, or a \u201cKingdom of Ends\u201d (G 4:433). The\nformulation of the CI states that we must \u201cact in accordance\nwith the maxims of a member giving universal laws for a merely\npossible kingdom of ends\u201d (G 4:439). It combines the others in\nthat (i) it requires that we conform our actions to the laws of an\nideal moral legislature, (ii) that this legislature lays down\nuniversal laws, binding all rational wills including our own, and\n(iii) that those laws are of \u201ca merely possible kingdom\u201d\neach of whose members equally possesses this status as legislator of\nuniversal laws, and hence must be treated always as an end in itself.\nThe intuitive idea behind this formulation is that our fundamental\nmoral obligation is to act only on principles which could earn\nacceptance by a community of fully rational agents each of whom have\nan equal share in legislating these principles for their\ncommunity.\n",
