    "main_text": "Two Arguments from God\u2019s Sovereignty || The Argument from Causal Order\n4.1 The Argument from Causal Order\n\n\nOne of the most popular arguments for monotheism is drawn from the\nworld\u2019s unity. If there were several designers who acted independently\nor at cross-purposes, we would expect to find evidence of this in their\nhandiwork\u2014one set of laws obtaining at one time or place, for\nexample, and a different set of laws obtaining at a different time or\nplace. We observe nothing of the sort, however. On the contrary, the\nunity of the world, the fact that it exhibits a uniform structure, that\nit is a single cosmos, strongly suggests some sort of unity in its\ncause\u2014that there is either a single designer, or several\ndesigners acting cooperatively, perhaps under the direction of one of\ntheir number.\n\n\nThis evidence does not force us to conclude that there is only one\ndesigner, and the ablest proponents of the argument have recognized\nthis. Thus, William Paley asserts that the argument proves only\n\u201ca unity of counsel\u201d or (if there are subordinate agents)\n\u201ca presiding\u201d or \u201ccontrolling will\u201d (Paley 52).\nNevertheless, in the absence of compelling reasons for postulating the\nexistence of two or more cooperating designers, considerations of\nsimplicity suggest that we ought to posit only one designer. It isn\u2019t\nclear that there are any. Some have thought that the existence of evil\nand apparent disorder is best explained by postulating conflicts\nbetween two or more opposed powers. Whether this is true or not, evil\nand apparent disorder provides no reason for preferring the hypothesis\nof several cooperating designers to the hypothesis of a single\ndesigner. That is, having once decided that natural good and natural\nevil are consequences of the operation of a single system of laws, and\nthat their cause must therefore be unitary, the existence of\nevil and apparent disorder is to longer relevant to the question of\nmonotheism (although it may be relevant to the question of the\ngoodness of the cause).\n\nA posteriori arguments of this type can\u2019t be used to show\nthat there can be only one god, however\u2014that\nmonotheism is conceptually required by the theist\u2019s concept of\ndivinity. A more powerful argument from God\u2019s sovereignty remedies this\ndeficiency.\n",
