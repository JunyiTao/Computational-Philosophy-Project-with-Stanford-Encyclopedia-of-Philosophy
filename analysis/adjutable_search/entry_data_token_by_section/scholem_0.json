    "main_text": "Biographical information\n1. Biographical information\n\n\nGershom Scholem was born Gerhard Scholem in Berlin in 1897. The\nScholem family had lived in Berlin since the early part of the\nnineteenth century. Gerhard's father Arthur was an assimilated\nJew and German nationalist, quite common among middle-class Berlin Jews\nat that time. Arthur Scholem had a successful business as a printer and\nit was there Scholem first became exposed to books at a very young age.\nThere is a story that in 1911, when Scholem had already rejected his\nfather's politics and openly espoused Zionism, his mother bought\nhim a portrait of Theodore Herzl as a Christmas present. Another\nversion has it that the portrait was hung on the Christmas tree in the\nScholem home. There were four boys in the Scholem family three of whom\nrebelled against their father's politics and Jewish identity in\ndifferent ways. The eldest son Reinhold joined the staunchly\nnationalist Deutsche Volkspartie, the third son Werner became a\ncommunist, and Gershom became a Zionist. Having no Jewish education\nprior to his Zionist turn in 1911 the adolescent Scholem began learning\nHebrew and studying Talmud in one of the Berlin community schools. By\n1915 he was immersing himself in any kabbalistic works he could find\neven though he admitted understanding very little. Although Zionism\nbrought Judaism to the center of the young Gershom's life it\nnever really inspired religious observance although Scholem tells us in\nthe biography of his early life From Berlin to Jerusalem that\nhe did experiment with some form of observance while still an\nadolescent in Germany. Throughout his life, however, Scholem remained a\ncommitted secularist, and secularism played an important role in his\nrendering of Jewish history and the study of Kabbala.\n\n\nThe rift between Scholem and his father grew as Gershom openly\ncriticized his father's German nationalism and bourgeois\nlifestyle. It reached a breaking point after a heated argument about\nhis brother Werner's impending court-martial for treason while\nserving in the German army. Arthur exploded and banished the young\nGershom from the family home, giving him 100 German Marks for his\njourney. This forced Gershom to find other living arrangements in\nBerlin. He had already become acquainted with the young Zionist Zalman\nRubashov who later became Zalman Shazar, the third president of Israel.\nRubashov, claiming Scholem's banishment made him a \u201crefugee\nfor Zionism,\u201d invited him to board at a rooming house on the west\nside of Berlin that housed numerous Eastern European Jewish immigrants\none of whom was Shai Agnon. Many of the Zionists he met there were\nolder and would subsequently have an important influence on his life\nespecially after he immigrated to Palestine in 1923.\n\n\nInspired by his radical Zionism and utter disdain for German\nnationalism Scholem expressed strong opposition to the Great War (and\nsubsequently nationalism more generally), a belief he held throughout\nhis life and affected his Zionism later on. Unable to avoid the draft\nafter two deferments, he entered the German army where he spent a mere\ntwo months before being discharged, labeled a \u201cpsychopath\ntemporarily unfit for duty.\u201d Scholem then entered The University\nof Berlin with an interest in studying pure mathematics which he\npursued for a few semesters before deciding he did not have sufficient\ntalent to succeed. It was around that time, in 1917, that Scholem\ndecided to immigrate to Palestine and the rest of his education in\nGermany was geared toward that end. During those years (approximately\n1916\u20131917) he met Martin Buber and, more importantly, Walter Benjamin,\nwho would have a profound influence on Scholem's intellectual\ntrajectory.\n\n\nAs was common among college youth in Germany, Scholem attended numerous\nuniversities. He ended up in Munich where he turned his attention to\nhis dissertation. He produced a translation and annotated version of\none of the first kabbalistic books Sefer ha-Bahir (the Book of\nIllumination), successfully defending his dissertation in January 1922\nand graduating summa cum laude. After graduation Scholem put\nall his energy into his immigration and in mid-September 1923 set off\nfor Palestine without any concrete plans as to how he would support\nhimself.\n\n\nSoon after his arrival he was offered a position as librarian of the\n\u201cHebrew Section\u201d of the newly founded National Library\nconnected with what would become the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. It\nwas in that position that Scholem began collecting and cataloging the\nhundreds of kabbalistic manuscripts that few had interest in and fewer\ncould read. His career began at that moment even though he was not\nappointed to a faculty position until some time later. Once he received\nhis faculty appointment, he remained at the Hebrew University until his\ndeath in 1982.\n",
