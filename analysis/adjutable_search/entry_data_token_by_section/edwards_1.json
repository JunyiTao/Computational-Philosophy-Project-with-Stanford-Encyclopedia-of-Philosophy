    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Theological Determinism\n2.1 Theological Determinism\n\nEdwards believed that indeterminism is incompatible with our\ndependence on God and hence with his sovereignty. If our responses to\nGod's grace are contra-causally free, then our salvation depends\npartly on us and God's sovereignty isn't \u201cabsolute and\nuniversal.\u201d Freedom of the Will defends theological\ndeterminism. Edwards begins by attempting to show that libertarianism\nis incoherent. For example, he argues that by\n\u2018self-determination\u2019 the libertarian must mean either that\none's actions including one's acts of willing are preceded by an act\nof free will or that one's acts of will lack sufficient causes. The\nfirst leads to an infinite regress while the second implies that acts\nof will happen accidentally and hence can't make someone \u201cbetter\nor worse, any more than a tree is better than other trees because it\noftener happens to be lit upon by a swan or nightingale; or a rock\nmore vicious than other rocks, because rattlesnakes have happened\noftener to crawl over it\u201d (Freedom of the Will, 1754;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 1, 327). On the second alternative, acts of\nchoosing (volitions) are neither chosen by us nor determined by\nreasons or our character or by other states of the soul. But if they\nare not, then they aren't truly ours and we cannot be held responsible\nfor them. Edwards also argues that libertarianism is inconsistent with\nordinary moral concepts. If, for example, the necessity of sinning\nwholly excuses, then a bias to sin should partially excuse. But it\ndoesn't; a person who acts from settled habits of maliciousness is\ndeemed \u201cso much the more worthy to be detested and\ncondemned\u201d (Freedom of the Will, 1754; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 1, 360). Since libertarianism implies that necessity\nexcuses, it is inconsistent with the way we attribute blame.\n\nIn Edwards' opinion, libertarianism's specious aura of plausibility is\ngrounded in a systematic confusion of \u201cphilosophical\u201d and\n\u201cvulgar\u201d (ordinary) usage. For example, in ordinary usage\nsomething (e.g., remaining seated) is said to be \u201cnecessary to\nus\u2026when we can't help it, let us do what we will\u201d\n(Freedom of the Will, 1754; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 1,\n150). Causal necessity doesn't entail \u201cvulgar necessity,\u201d\nhowever. Ingrained habits, deeply felt resentment, and the like may\ncausally necessitate a malicious action. It doesn't follow that the\nagent wouldn't have refrained from acting maliciously if she had\nchosen not to act maliciously. Hence, the fact that she was causally\nunable to act other than she did does not imply that she was unable to\ndo so in the \u201cvulgar\u201d or ordinary sense. Libertarians are\ntherefore mistaken in thinking that because vulgar necessity excuses,\nso does causal necessity. Again, \u2018freedom\u2019 or\n\u2018liberty\u2019 in common speech refer only to \u201cthat power\nand opportunity for one to do and conduct as he will, or according to\nhis choice,\u201d and contains no reference to the \u201ccause or\noriginal\u201d of the act of will (Freedom of the Will,\n1754; Edwards 1957\u2013vol. 1, 163\u201364). Hence, that liberty in\nthe ordinary sense is essential to moral agency does not entail that\ncontra-causal freedom is. It is also important to note that action in\nthe ordinary sense is \u201csome motion or exertion of power, that is\nvoluntary, or that is the effect of the will\u2026[the term\nis] most commonly used to signify outward actions\u201d (Freedom\nof the Will, 1754; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 1, 346). Improperly\nextending the term \u2018action\u2019 to movements of the will has\nled some libertarians to conclude that since external behavior must be\npreceded by an act of will to be voluntary, and an appropriate object\nof moral appraisal, so too must acts of will. A consequence is the\nlibertarian's misleading talk of the will's self-determination.\n\nEdwards' principle reasons for theological determinism are\nGod's sovereignty, the principle of sufficient reason (which requires\nthat everything that begins to be have a complete cause), the nature\nof motivation, and God's foreknowledge. The latter two are discussed\nat length.\n\nThe argument from motivation depends upon Edwards' identification of\nwilling or choosing with one's strongest inclination or preference.\nSince choosing just is a prevailing inclination, it is\nlogically impossible to choose in the absence of a prevailing motive.\nIf there is a prevailing motive, however, then the will is necessarily\ndetermined by it, for if the will were to choose contrary to a\nprevailing motive, the agent would have two opposed preponderant\ninclinations at the same time. All choices, therefore, are necessarily\ndetermined.\n\nEdwards' most impressive arguments from divine foreknowledge are based\non the impossibility of knowing future contingents and on the\nnecessity of the past. One knows p only if one has evidence for it,\nand evidence \u201cmust be one of\u2026two sorts, either\nself-evidence or proof.\u201d Propositions about\nfuture contingents can't be self-evident, however, because the states\nof affairs they represent are neither present to the mind nor\nnecessary. But they can't be proved either, for if the state of\naffairs expressed by the proposition is genuinely contingent,\n\u201cthere is nothing now existent with which the future existence\nof the contingent event is [necessarily] connected.\u201d Future\ncontingents are thus necessarily unknowable (Freedom of the\nWill, 1754; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 1, 259). Since God's\nknowledge of the future is comprehensive, it follows that no future\nevent (and so no future human action) is genuinely contingent.\n\nThe conclusion also follows from the necessity of the past. Suppose I\nmake a decision D at time t. Since God is\nomniscient, he has always believed that D occurs at\nt. Since he can't be mistaken, God's believing at some\nearlier time tn that D occurs at\nt entails that D occurs at t. But God's\nforebelief is past in relation to t and is therefore\n\u201cnow necessary\u201d in the sense that nothing done at\nt can alter it. What is entailed by a necessary fact is\nitself necessary, however. Therefore, D could not fail to\noccur at t. Nor can one evade this conclusion by appealing to\nGod's timelessness as some do. For even if God's\n\u2018forebeliefs\u2019 are timeless and so don't precede the events\nthey are about, divinely inspired prophecies are not. Yet divinely\ninspired prophecies, too, are necessarily connected with the human\nactions they foretell and they are clearly past (and hence necessary)\nin relation to them.\n\nNecessity is consistent with moral responsibility, however. We are\nsaid to be responsible for our actions when we act as we choose and\ndeterminism does not deny that our actions often spring from our\nchoices. Nor is necessity incompatible with praise and blame. Even\nthough God and Christ necessarily act for the best, their actions are\neminently praiseworthy.\n\nIt is worth noting that the aim of Edwards' philosophically\nsophisticated arguments is theological. He saw that \n\nif modern divines\u2026can maintain their peculiar notion of\nfreedom, consisting in the self-determining power of the\nwill, as necessary to moral agency\u2026, then they have an\nimpregnable castle, to which they may repair, and remain invincible,\nin all the controversies they have with the reformed divines\nconcerning original sin, the sovereignty of grace,\nelection\u2026, and other principles of the like kind. (Original\nSin, 1758; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 1, 376)\n\n\nEdwards recognizes that \u201cmodern divines\u201d pretend that\ndoctrines like these undermine \u201cthe very foundation of all\nreligion and morality\u201d (Freedom of the Will, 1754;\nEdwards 1957, vol. 1, 422). Freedom of the Will concludes by\narguing that, on the contrary, they do a much better job of supporting\nthem.\n",
