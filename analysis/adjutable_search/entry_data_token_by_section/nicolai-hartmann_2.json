    "main_text": "What is the Relationship between Thinking and Being?\n3. What is the Relationship between Thinking and Being?\n\nHartmann was committed to approaching the problem of cognition from\nthe perspective of its embeddedness in a broader cognitive and\nontological context. Human cognition is in a perpetual state of\nunrest, dynamically allowing us to get our bearings in an\noverstimulating environment, to orient ourselves in the world, and to\npursue practical projects. It is an active and open process of coming\nto terms with an environing world in historical time, not an isolated\nand static epistemological exercise. In our unrest we come up against\nproblems in need of solution. Hartmann was strongly influenced by\nKant\u2019s famous claim that experience presents problems that\nreason is unable to solve, such as the \u201cantinomies\u201d\nbearing on the origin of the cosmos and of freedom. This is a claim\nabout the limitations of human reason, and more generally, a statement\nabout the relation between thinking and being. Contrary to dogmatic\nmetaphysics, Kant claimed that thinking does not have complete access\nto being. Our very consciousness that there are problems in\nreality\u2014not just temporary, episodic problems but perennial,\nenduring ones\u2014in fact demonstrates this limitation quite\nclearly. If we begin with the whole \u201cphenomenon of\ncognition,\u201d as Hartmann did in his groundbreaking\nepistemological work, and not merely with the narrower relation\nbetween subject and object, we see that it includes features such as\n\u201cproblem consciousness\u201d and \u201ccognitive\nprogress.\u201d These complex \u201cfacts,\u201d he showed,\npresuppose that there is an ontological basis for what is cognized.\nThe main point of Metaphysics of Cognition was that\nepistemological discussions always entail ontological assumptions\nabout the nature of what exists. Determining the minimum set of these\nassumptions for an adequate account of cognitive phenomena was its\ntask.\n\nIn distinguishing himself from his predecessors and peers, Hartmann\ncarefully situated himself between various forms of idealism and\nexaggerated scientific realism. In contrast to his \u201clogical\nidealist\u201d teachers, German Idealists like Hegel, and\nphenomenological idealism, Hartmann thought that human thinking did\nnot have easy access to its own workings, let alone those of the real\nworld, and they certainly did not play the primary role in\n\u201cconstituting\u201d the world. In contrast to na\u00efve\nrealists and positivists, he did not think that human perception and\nexperience provided an unmediated adequate cognition of the world\neither. Deliberately positioning himself between these forms of\nidealism and na\u00efve realism, Hartmann produced a\n\u201ccritical\u201d epistemology that based itself on Kantian\nprinciples.\n\nAs one of the phenomena of cognition, Hartmann took human\nconsciousness of problems very seriously. He believed that in the\nhistory of philosophy and science, thinkers arrived at many so-called\nsolutions to problems by means of hasty theoretical assumptions rather\nthan patient investigation. Any philosophy deserving of the epithet\n\u201ccritical\u201d must be able to set aside the assumptions that\narise from theoretical \u201cstandpoints\u201d that can prejudice an\ninvestigation from the start. Critical philosophy, for Hartmann,\ndesignates a stance \u201cthis side\u201d of idealism and realism,\nengaging an epoch\u00e9 (suspension) with respect to\nquestionable standpoints. Such standpoints can blind us to seeing what\nis \u201ctranshistorical\u201d in the history of philosophy, as well\nas to what is \u201cgiven\u201d in phenomena. The contrast between\nthe historical and the transhistorical is a significant one for\nHartmann and shapes much of his thinking. It does not coincide with\nthe traditional contrast between timeless essences and historical\nparticulars, for instance, but cuts across it, as we explain\nbelow.\n\nIt is already evident in the definition of problems themselves. Three\naspects of problems must be distinguished. There is the\n\u201cstatement of the problem\u201d (Problemstellung), its\nparticular and perhaps idiosyncratic characterization; there is the\n\u201ccurrent state of the problem\u201d (Problemlage),\nmore stable but still historically malleable; and there are the\n\u201ccontents of the problem\u201d (Problemgehalt),\nincluding its sometimes nonrational and impenetrable aspects, which\nare properly \u201cmetaphysical.\u201d It is worth quoting at\nlength:\n\nHuman beings are the ones who first \u201cstate\u201d problems\n(Problemstellung); they are brought up to see the current\nstate of the problems (Problemlage) in a tradition, but also\nlabor to transform this situation themselves. By no means, however, do\nhuman beings have dominion over the contents of problems\n(Problemgehalt). There is nothing in the problem contents\nthat is a product of human artifice. The problem content is already\ngiven along with the overall structure of the world and the place of\nhumankind in it, and something of this content can change only to the\ndegree that the world and humankind also change in their fundamental\nfeatures. The history of problems does not have to do with the problem\ncontents (Problemgehalt), but only with the stepwise shifting\nof the current state of the problem (Problemlage) tied to\nthem and the multifariously varying statements of the problems\n(Problemstellung) within these contours. Problem contents\npersist identically, while the latter emerge or are submerged\nhistorically in unforeseeable variety (ME1b).\n\n\nTranshistorical \u201cproblem contents\u201d could include both real\nand ideal factors, and only meticulous investigation can determine\nwhat these are. Unfortunately, there is no a priori way to\ndetermine which is which. While this conception of\n\u201cproblems\u201d is likely influenced by the southwestern\nNeo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband (1958 [1893]), this distinction is\nactually widely applicable throughout Hartmann\u2019s work. The same\ntranshistorical-historical division applies to ethical values as well\nas to ontological and cognitive categories, though in different ways.\nIn general, it allows Hartmann to take a middle path between the\nextremes of absolutism and relativism, whether in regard to\nepistemology, ethics, or to ontology. Investigation of phenomena in\nall of these areas leads us to see that some core factors are\nrelatively stable, while other elements are culturally and\nhistorically variable. This conception of problems sits midway between\nthe Anglo-analytic view that problems like \u201cthe\nmind-body problem\u201d are simply \u201cthere\u201d and have\nnothing historical about them, and a historicist view in which\neverything about the problem is historical, with no stable problematic\nfactors at all.\n\nKant\u2019s work inspired this stance on the relation between\nthinking and being, as we see in Hartmann\u2019s sophisticated\ninterpretation of Kant\u2019s \u201csupreme principle.\u201d\nReaders will recall Kant\u2019s principle: \u201cthe conditions of\nthe possibility of experience in general must at the same time be the\nconditions of the possibility of the objects of experience\u201d\n(Kant 1998 [1787], A158/B197). This was Kant\u2019s attempt to\nformulate a universal basic principle for the relation between\nthinking and the world. For Kant, this meant that the\nintersubjectively and objectively valid \u201cforms of\nintuition\u201d and the \u201cconcepts of the understanding,\u201d\nwhich science relies on to explain the objects of experience, must be\ndictated by the mind to the world in its very experience of things.\nHartmann argued that this expresses a \u201crestricted identity\nthesis,\u201d meaning that the principles or conditions of both\nsubject and object are neither completely identical nor completely\ndifferent. As Hartmann reads it, Kant\u2019s principle is itself\nentirely \u201cthis side\u201d of the distinction between idealism\nand realism. In other words, it can be interpreted in the direction of\nplacing the conditions of experience inside the subject (Kant\u2019s\nidealist solution), or both within and beyond the subject in the world\n(a realist solution). Hartmann claims that Kant\u2019s idealistic\ninterpretation, which makes these conditions internal to the cognizing\n(transcendental) subject, results from a \u201cdogmatic\nprejudice.\u201d He believes that a solution that remains faithful to\nthe phenomena of cognition can be proposed that places the principles\nor conditions of experience not within the subject but within the\nwider reality of which both subject and object are parts. The at least\n\u201cpartial identity\u201d between subject and object which\nconditions the possibility of knowledge results from the fact that\nboth subject and object are determined by some shared ontological\nprinciples structurally superior to both. In other words, according to\nHartmann, in his explanation of valid a priori cognition,\nKant relied on a false dichotomy. Either representations are\ndetermined by the object, or the object is determined by\nrepresentations. Hartmann points out that this is not a complete\ndisjunction, and so is false. The third possibility is that both\nrepresentation and object are determined by a third factor, namely,\nprinciples that are valid for both subjects and objects. These\nprinciples are what Hartmann calls categories. The partial identity of\ncognitive and ontological categories, however, must be very carefully\ndelimited. This is the work of categorial analysis, the central task\nof ontology. Incidentally, many of Hartmann\u2019s responses to\nKantian idealism anticipate those of recent \u201cnew realists\u201d\nand \u201cspeculative realists\u201d by almost a century (Peterson\n2017a).\n\nThe methodology that Hartmann recommends reflects the critical stance.\nIn order to avoid precipitous standpoints, an unbiased philosophical\ninquiry moves through the three main stages of phenomenological,\naporetic and theoretical development. The first stage is descriptive\nand requires the systematic collection of all the available evidence\nrelevant to whatever is under scrutiny. Frequently, descriptions end\nup in conflicting theses, often in the form of aporias. More than\nanyone else, Hartmann rehabilitates the value of aporias (see\nSchlittmaier 2011 and Rescher 2011). Aporias themselves are\ninformative and should not be forced to disappear by fiat,\nsuch as an a priori assumption on the overall uniformity of\nreality or the assumption that we have a direct, transparent access to\nreality. The last phase of the philosophical method consists in using\nas few metaphysical assumptions as possible for the systematic\ntheoretical coordination of the results from the first two phases (ME,\nS). Metaphysical assumptions are necessary for the task of\nincorporating phenomena and aporias into a framework able to make\nsense of them. Since metaphysical assumptions are not directly\nsupported by descriptive data, it is advisable to keep them to a\nminimum, or to assume the weakest possible metaphysical\nassumptions.\n\nAn original way of distinguishing between ontology and metaphysics\nunderlies the third stage of theoretical development. Ontology, for\nHartmann, deals with what can be subsumed under at least partially\ncognizable categories, while metaphysics deals with the nonrational or\nnoncognizable. Two main consequences follow from this view of\nontology: firstly, ontology is primarily a theory of categories, in\nthe sense that all ontological distinctions have the form of\ncategories (AIntro1), and secondly, \u201cscience\u201d in all its\nbranches (including the human/social sciences) is ontological in all\nits ramifications (OLF37a), and is the most powerful ally of ontology.\nThis is rather at odds with the mainstream view of science as an\neminently epistemological affair (present in positivism,\nNeo-Kantianism, phenomenology, existentialism, postmodernism, etc.).\nThis is one of the issues on which Hartmann firmly departs from the\nNeo-Kantian legacy, as well as from the generalized critique of the\nnatural scientific approach in mainstream twentieth century\nContinental philosophy.\n\nThis methodology is already employed in the Metaphysics of\nCognition. A phenomenological description that extracts the\n\u201cessential features\u201d from the phenomenon of cognition\nwould note that: cognizers face off against something to-be-cognized;\nthey attempt to \u201cgrasp\u201d that something; they form an\n\u201cimage\u201d (broadly speaking) of that something; the image is\nsomehow \u201cdetermined\u201d by the something; that something is\nentirely untouched by the cognizer\u2019s attempt to grasp it; they\nmay or may not be in error about it (truth criterion); cognizers may\nbecome conscious of problems surrounding the something; and they may\nsucceed or fail in making cognitive progress regarding them (ME5a-i).\nFrom among these factors, take the central feature of\n\u201cgrasping.\u201d The phenomenon of grasping generates an\naporia: how does the mind go \u201cout of itself\u201d to grasp a\ntranscendent object? The sense of being faced with something that one\ndid not anticipate or create and that one must now \u201cgrasp\u201d\nis often simply backgrounded by antirealists who claim that the mind\nunconsciously creates its objects, or is imprisoned in a circle of its\nown \u201cpositings\u201d (ME6a). This is a\n\u201cskeptical-subjectivistic\u201d resolution to the aporia of\ngrasping that simply ignores rather than does justice to the\nphenomenon. It fails to distinguish between image and thing; what is\ncurrently \u201cobjectified\u201d in it; the object and the\n\u201ctransobjective\u201d (currently unknown but knowable); and\nwhat may even be \u201ctransintelligible\u201d (nonrational) in the\nthing. Only by retaining the Kantian distinction between object\n(appearance) and \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d can we account for this\ncentral phenomenon of grasping. Far from being irrelevant, Hartmann\nbelieves that the thing-in-itself is the \u201cfundamental and\neminently critical concept\u201d (ME30a). It is needed to explain the\nphenomenon of transcendence in the total phenomenon of cognition.\nProblem consciousness, which entails \u201cknowing that you\ndon\u2019t know,\u201d implicitly recognizes what is transobjective,\nand possibly transintelligible, in the thing. It implies a relation\nbetween the subject as existing knower and something existing\nindependently of it. The phenomenon of cognition overflows the domain\nof epistemology into ontology.\n\nThe mere fact (Faktum) that in problem consciousness and\ncognitive progress cognition ineluctably extends beyond its limits,\nand that problem consciousness does not stop at the limits of\ncognizability, forces us to realize that in general the ontological\ncharacter of the object overpowers the object-character of being,\ni.e., that ontological being in itself is concealed behind\ngnoseological being in itself (ME9f).\n\n\nIn other words, what problem consciousness entails is that objects are\nalways more than \u201can object for a subject,\u201d and even the\nnatural attitude toward the world takes this for granted. The burden\nof proof is thus on idealism to show that there is no such thing. This\nis in fact impossible, since even idealism assumes at the very least\nthat the cognizing subject is something \u201cin itself,\u201d\notherwise there is nothing but an infinite regress of representations\n(ME30b-c). The regress has to stop with something that\n\u201cis,\u201d and we need ontology to determine what this\nmeans.\n\nThe question of the section, \u201cWhat is the relation between\nthinking and being?\u201d, is thus answered by way of an extensive\nphenomenology, aporetics, and theory of cognition that clings to the\nbasic aspect of transcendence and grasping, debunking rationalist\npretensions to transparently cognize everything. It is not the case\nthat \u201cbeing is immanent to thinking,\u201d but that\n\u201cthinking is immanent to being.\u201d \u201cThis ontological\nimmanence has the simple meaning of total embeddedness of the\nrational in a larger sphere of the nonrational, in whose thoroughgoing\nrelations it is completely interwoven and in whose existing\ndeterminations it remains interwoven even where a consciousness of\nthese relations does not extend. It is the total embeddedness of\nthinking and of cognition as a whole in being\u201d (ME35d). It\nshould be noted that Heidegger also demoted cognition to secondary\nontological status in Being and Time (\u00a713, 1962 [1927]),\nand refers there to Hartmann\u2019s book.\n\nIn later work, the embeddedness of cognition in a wider network of\nsocial, affective, and practical activity is highlighted to an even\ngreater extent, and is further considered in the context of debates\nover universalism and relativism (or the contrast between\n\u201cscience\u201d and \u201cworldviews\u201d) (e.g.,\nAIntro9\u201311). Put simply, Hartmann embraces a nonreductive naturalistic\ninterpretation of humankind, recognizing cognition as an adaptive\nembodied transcendent act embedded in the context of other acts and\nontological relationships in the natural and social worlds (ELO). This\nperspective, including his interpretation of Kant explained above,\nmeans that our concepts of categories are human products, and are\nattempts to grasp stable ontological principles. As such our attempts\ncan be inadequate. Principles themselves may have nonrational\nelements, since they are transcendent objects too. The partial\nidentity between cognitive and ontological categories is rooted in\nbeing, rather than the mind alone, and persistent problems arise from\nhuman interaction with the world and each other.\n",
