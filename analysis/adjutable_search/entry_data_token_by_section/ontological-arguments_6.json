    "main_text": "G\u00f6del\u2019s Ontological Argument\n7. G\u00f6del\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nThere is a small, but steadily growing, literature on the ontological\narguments which G\u00f6del developed in his notebooks, but which did\nnot appear in print until well after his death. These arguments have\nbeen discussed, annotated and amended by various leading logicians:\nthe upshot is a family of arguments with impeccable logical\ncredentials. (Interested readers are referred to Sobel 1987, Anderson\n1990, Adams 1995b, and Hazen 1999 for the history of these arguments,\nand for the scholarly annotations and emendations.) Here, we give\na brief presentation of the version of the argument which is developed\nby Anderson, and then make some comments on that version.\nThis discussion follows the presentation and discussion in Oppy 1996,\n2000. \n\nDefinition 1: x is God-like if and only if x has as\nessential properties those and only those properties which are\npositive\n\n\nDefinition 2: A is an essence of x if and only if\nfor every property B, x has B necessarily\nif and only if A entails B\n\nDefinition 3: x necessarily exists if and only if every\nessence of x is necessarily exemplified\n\nAxiom 1: If a property is positive, then its negation is not\npositive.\n\nAxiom 2: Any property entailed by\u2014i.e., strictly implied\nby\u2014a positive property is positive\n\nAxiom 3: The property of being God-like is positive\n\nAxiom 4: If a property is positive, then it is necessarily\npositive\n\nAxiom 5: Necessary existence is positive\n\nAxiom 6: For any property P, if P is positive, then\nbeing necessarily P is positive.\n\nTheorem 1: If a property is positive, then it is consistent, i.e.,\npossibly exemplified.\n\nCorollary 1: The property of being God-like is consistent.\n\nTheorem 2: If something is God-like, then the property of being\nGod-like is an essence of that thing.\n\nTheorem 3: Necessarily, the property of being God-like is\nexemplified.\n\n\nGiven a sufficiently generous conception of properties, and granted\nthe acceptability of the underlying modal logic, the listed theorems\ndo follow from the axioms. (This point was argued in detail by Dana\nScott, in lecture notes which circulated for many years and which were\ntranscribed in Sobel 1987 and published in Sobel 2004. It is also made\nby Sobel, Anderson, and Adams.) So, criticisms of the argument are\nbound to focus on the axioms, or on the other assumptions which are\nrequired in order to construct the proof.\n\nSome philosophers have denied the acceptability of the underlying\nmodal logic. And some philosophers have rejected generous conceptions\nof properties in favour of sparse conceptions according to which only\nsome predicates express properties. But suppose that we adopt neither\nof these avenues of potential criticism of the proof. What else might\nwe say against it?\n\nOne important point to note is that no definition of the\nnotion of \u201cpositive property\u201d is supplied with the proof.\nAt most, the various axioms which involve this concept can be taken to\nprovide a partial implicit definition. If we suppose that the\n\u201cpositive properties\u201d form a set, then the axioms provide\nus with the following information about this set:\n\nIf a property belongs to the set, then its negation does not\nbelong to the set.\nThe set is closed under entailment.\nThe property of having as essential properties just those\nproperties which are in the set is itself a member of the set.\nThe set has exactly the same members in all possible worlds.\nThe property of necessary existence is in the set.\nIf a property is in the set, then the property of having that\nproperty necessarily is also in the set.\n\n\nOn G\u00f6del\u2019s theoretical assumptions, we can show that\nany set which conforms to (1)\u2013(6) is such that the\nproperty of having as essential properties just those properties which\nare in that set is exemplified. G\u00f6del wants us to\nconclude that there is just one intuitive, theologically interesting\nset of properties which is such that the property of having as\nessential properties just the properties in that set is exemplified.\nBut, on the one hand, what reason do we have to think that there is\nany theologically interesting set of properties which\nconforms to the G\u00f6delian specification? And, on the other hand,\nwhat reason do we have to deny that, if there is one set of\ntheologically interesting set of properties which conforms to the\nG\u00f6delian specification, then there are many theologically\nthreatening sets of properties which also conform to that\nspecification?\n\nIn particular, there is some reason to think that the G\u00f6delian\nontological argument goes through just as well\u2014or just as\nbadly\u2014with respect to other sets of properties (and in ways\nwhich are damaging to the original argument). Suppose that there is\nsome set of independent properties {I,\nG1, G2, \u2026} which can be\nused to generate the set of positive properties by closure under\nentailment and \u201cnecessitation\u201d.\n(\u201cIndependence\u201d means: no one of the properties in the set\nis entailed by all the rest. \u201cNecessitation\u201d means: if\nP is in the set, then so is necessarily having P.\nI is the property of having as essential properties just\nthose properties which are in the set. G1,\nG2, \u2026 are further properties, of which we\nrequire at least two.) Consider any proper subset of the set\n{G1, G2,\n\u2026}\u2014{H1, H2,\n\u2026}, say\u2014and define a new generating set {I*,\nH1, H2, \u2026}, where\nI* is the property of having as essential properties just\nthose properties which are in the newly generated set. A\n\u201cproof\u201d parallel to that offered by G\u00f6del\n\u201cestablishes\u201d that there is a being which has as essential\nproperties just those properties in this new set. If there are as few\nas 7 independent properties in the original generating set, then we\nshall be able to establish the existence of 720\ndistinct\u201cGod-like\u201d creatures by the kind of argument which\nG\u00f6del offers. (The creatures are distinct because each has a\ndifferent set of essential properties.)\n\nEven if the above considerations are sufficient to cast doubt on the\ncredentials of G\u00f6del\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d, they do not\npinpoint where the \u201cproof\u201d goes wrong. If we accept that\nthe role of Axioms 1, 2, 4, and 6 is really just to constrain the\nnotion of \u201cpositive property\u201d in the right way\u2014or,\nin other words, if we suppose that Axioms 1, 2, 4, and 6 are\n\u201canalytic truths\u201d about \u201cpositive\nproperties\u201d\u2014then there is good reason for opponents of the\n\u201cproof\u201d to be sceptical about Axioms 3 and 5. Kant would\nnot have been happy with Axiom 5; and there is at least some reason to\nthink that whether the property of being God-like is\n\u201cpositive\u201d ought to depend upon whether or not there is a\nGod-like being.\n\nFor detailed recent discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument, see\nKovac (2003), Pruss (2009) (2018), and Swietorzecka (2016).\n",
