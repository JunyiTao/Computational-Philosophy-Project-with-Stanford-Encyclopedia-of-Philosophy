    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Non-physical theories\n9.9 Non-physical theories\n\n\nMost specific theories of consciousness\u2014whether cognitive,\nneural or quantum mechanical\u2014aim to explain or model\nconsciousness as a natural feature of the physical world. However,\nthose who reject a physicalist ontology of consciousness must find ways\nof modeling it as a nonphysical aspect of reality. Thus those who adopt\na dualist or anti-physicalist metaphysical view must in the end provide\nspecific models of consciousness different from the five types above.\nBoth substance dualists and property dualists must develop the details\nof their theories in ways that articulate the specific natures of the\nrelevant non-physical features of reality with which they equate\nconsciousness or to which they appeal in order to explain it.\n\n\nA variety of such models have been proposed including the following.\nDavid Chalmers (1996) has offered an admittedly speculative version of\npanpsychism which appeals to the notion of information not only to\nexplain psycho-physical invariances between phenomenal and physically\nrealized information spaces but also to possibly explain the ontology\nof the physical as itself derived from the informational (a version of\n\u201cit from bit\u201d theory). In a somewhat similar vein, Gregg\nRosenberg has (2004) proposed an account of consciousness that\nsimultaneously addresses the ultimate categorical basis of causal\nrelations. In both the causal case and the conscious case, Rosenberg\nargues the relational-functional facts must ultimately depend upon a\ncategorical non-relational base, and he offers a model according to\nwhich causal relations and qualitative phenomenal facts both depend\nupon the same base. Also, as noted just above (section 9.8), some\nquantum theories treat consciousness as a fundamental feature of\nreality (Stapp 1993), and insofar as they do so, they might be\nplausibly classified as non-physical theories as well.\n",
