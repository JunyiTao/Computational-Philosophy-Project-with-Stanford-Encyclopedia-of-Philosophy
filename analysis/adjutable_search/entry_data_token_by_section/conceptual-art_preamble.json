    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of art addresses a broad spectrum of theoretical issues\narising from a wide variety of objects of attention. These range from\nPaleolithic cave painting to postmodern poetry, and from the problem\nof how music can convey emotion to that of the metaphysical status of\nfictional characters. Until recently, however, philosophical interest\nin conceptual art, or conceptualism, has been notably sparse. Why?\nAfter all, both philosophy and the myriad kinds and styles of art and\nart-making that fall under the conceptual tradition all have one thing\nin common: they are both intended to make you think and ask pressing\nquestions. What are those questions and how do we go about answering\nthem?\n",
