    "main_text": "Decoherence and the Measurement Problem\n2. Decoherence and the Measurement Problem\n\nOne often hears the claim that decoherence solves the measurement\nproblem of quantum mechanics (see the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory).\n Physicists who work on decoherence generally know better, but it is\nimportant to see why even in the presence of decoherence phenomena,\nthe measurement problem remains or in fact gets even worse.\n\nThe measurement problem is really a complex of problems, revolving\naround the question of whether one can apply quantum mechanics itself\nto the description of quantum measurements. One can just deny this, if\none takes quantum mechanics to be a phenomenological theory. But if\nquantum mechanics is not the fundamental theory that explains the\nphenomenology of quantum measurements, the question arises how we can\nexplain what \u2018measurements\u2019 and \u2018results\u2019 are.\nThis is the measurement problem in the wide sense of the term.\n\nIf instead we assume that quantum mechanics is itself applicable to\nthe description of measurements, then the question becomes one of how\none should model a measurement within quantum theory, specifically as\nsome appropriate interaction between a \u2018system\u2019 and an\n\u2018apparatus\u2019, and of whether by so doing one can\nderive from the unitary evolution for the total system of\nsystem and apparatus the three phenomenological aspects of quantum\nmeasurements: that measurements have results, that these results\nobtain with some characteristic probabilities, and that depending on\nthe result of a measurement the state of the system is generally\ntransformed in a characteristic way (for this subdivision of the\nproblem, see Maudlin 1995). This derivation, however, appears to be\nimpossible.\n\nIndeed, as pointed out already by von Neumann (1932, Section VI.3),\none cannot reproduce the correct probabilities by assuming that they\narise because we are ignorant of the exact state of a macroscopic\napparatus. But whatever the exact initial state of the apparatus, if\nthe system (say, an electron) is described by a superposition of two\ngiven states, say, spin in \\(x\\)-direction equal \\(+\\frac{1}{2}\\) and spin in\n\\(x\\)-direction equal \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\), and we let it interact\nwith a measuring apparatus that couples to these states, the final\nquantum state of the composite will be a sum of two components, one in\nwhich the apparatus has coupled to (has registered) \\(x\\)-spin \\(= +\\frac{1}{2}\\), and one in which the apparatus has coupled to (has registered)\n\\(x\\)-spin \\(= -\\frac{1}{2}\\).[13]\n This is the measurement problem in the narrow sense of the term. \n",
