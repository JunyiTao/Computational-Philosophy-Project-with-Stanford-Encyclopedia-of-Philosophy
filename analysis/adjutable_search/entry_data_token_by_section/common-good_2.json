Defects in a \u201cPrivate Society\u201d\n\nWhy does political philosophy need the concept of the common good?\nWhat\u2019s the rationale for having this concept in addition to\nother concepts, such as welfare, justice, or human rights? To\nunderstand the importance of the common good, it is helpful to think\nabout the moral defects in a private society.\n\nA private society is a society whose members care only about\ntheir lives as private individuals (Tocqueville 1835\u20131840; Hegel\n1821; Rawls 1971; see also Dewey 1927). Members are not necessarily\nrational egoists\u2014they may care about their family and friends.\nWhat is central is that their motivational horizons do not extend\nbeyond the people and projects that are the focus of their personal\n lives.[6]\n As an individual in a private society, I might be interested in\nacquiring a better home for my family or improving the local school\nfor my children and the other children in my neighborhood. I might\neven vote in national elections insofar as the results could affect my\nhome or my local school. But I take no interest in national elections\ninsofar as the results affect citizens I don\u2019t know, those in\nother states or provinces. And I take no interest in national\nelections insofar as the results affect the basic fairness of my\nsociety\u2019s laws and institutions. Having withdrawn into private\nlife, I care about the common affairs of the community only insofar as\nthese touch my private world.\n\nMany philosophers believe that there is something morally defective\nabout a private society. One type of defect bears especially on the\ncase of a private society that consists of rational egoists. As I\nnoted in the last section, a community of rational egoists will not\nperform the actions necessary to generate public goods. Since these\ngoods are desirable, the absence of public goods may be suboptimal,\nboth from the standpoint of aggregate welfare and from the standpoint\nof each member\u2019s egoistic\n rationality.[7]\n So there are good instrumental reasons for people to create a public\nagency\u2014i.e., a state\u2014that can use taxes, subsidies and\ncoercive threats to draw people into mutually beneficial patterns of\n cooperation.[8]\n\nThe common good, however, points to a different kind of defect in a\nprivate society. The defect in this case extends to all forms of\nprivate society, not just to a society of rational egoists, and the\ndefect is noninstrumental. The defect in this case is that the members\nof a political community have a relational obligation to care\nabout their common affairs, so the fact that they are exclusively\nconcerned with their private lives is itself a moral defect in the\ncommunity, whether or not this pattern of concern leads to a suboptimal outcome.\n\nTo appreciate the point, think about the various public roles that\npeople may occupy in a liberal democracy (see Hegel 1821; Dewey 1927;\nJ. Cohen 2010: 54\u201358). Most obviously, citizens act in a public\ncapacity when they occupy positions as legislators, civil servants,\njudges, prosecutors, jurors, police officers, soldiers, school\nteachers, and so on. They also act in a public capacity when they\nparticipate in the political process, voting in elections and taking\npart in policy discussions in the public sphere (Habermas 1992; Mill\n1862; Rawls 1993 [2005]). And\nmany philosophers argue that citizens act in a public\ncapacity\u2014or at least in a partly public capacity\u2014when they\nact as executives in large business enterprises (McMahon 2013;\nChristiano 2010); as high-ranking officials in colleges and\nuniversities (Scanlon 2003); as journalists, lawyers, and academics\n(Habermas 1992, e.g., [1996: 373\u20139]); as protesters engaged in\ncivil disobedience (Rawls 1971); and as socially conscious consumers\n(Hussain 2012).\n\nWhen citizens occupy public roles, political morality requires them to\nthink and act differently than they would if they were acting as\nprivate individuals. If you are a judge in a criminal trial, you might\nstand to benefit personally if the defendant were found guilty. But\npolitical morality does not allow you to decide cases as if you were a\nprivate individual, looking to advance your own private objectives. As\na judge, you are required to make decisions based on the evidence\npresented at trial and the standards set out in the law. These legal\nstandards themselves are supposed to answer to common interests. So,\nin effect, political morality directs you to think and act from the\nstandpoint of a shared concern for common interests.\n\nCitizens who occupy public roles may also be required to make personal\nsacrifices. Consider an historical example. During the Watergate\nscandal, President Richard Nixon ordered the Attorney General of the\nUnited States, Elliot Richardson, to fire the Watergate special\nprosecutor in order to stop an investigation into Nixon\u2019s abuses\nof power. Rather than carry out Nixon\u2019s order, Richardson\nresigned his position. Many would argue that Richardson did the right\nthing, and that, in fact, he had an obligation to refuse Nixon\u2019s\norder, even if this resulted in a significant setback to his career.\nAs Attorney General, Richardson had an obligation to uphold the rule\nof law in the United States, a practice that serves common interests,\neven if this meant significant sacrifices in terms of his career\naspirations.\n\nNow consider the following possibility. Imagine that we are living in\na liberal democracy with a full array of social roles in which people\nact in a public capacity. But imagine that our society is a private\nsociety: citizens care only about their own private affairs. In order\nto ensure that various public roles are filled, our institutions\ncreate private incentives for people to take on these\nresponsibilities. High salaries draw people into positions as judges\nand legislators, and mutual surveillance gives these people private\nincentives to carry out their duties. Suppose that our institutions\nare well structured and private incentives are adequate to fill all of\nthe important public positions. Is there anything missing in our\nsociety? Does our society suffer from a moral defect of some kind?\n\nPhilosophers in the common good tradition believe that the answer is\nyes: there is something morally significant that is missing from our\nsociety. What is missing is a genuine concern for the common\ngood. No one in our society actually cares about shared\nfacilities, such as the rule of law, or the common interests that\nthese facilities serve. Citizens fill various public roles simply for\nthe sake of the private benefits that they get from doing so.\nAccording to a common good conception of political morality, this lack\nof concern for the common good is itself a moral defect in a political\ncommunity, even if private incentives lead people to fill all of the\nrelevant positions.\n\nA central challenge for theorists in the common good tradition is to\nexplain why a genuine commitment to the common good matters. Why\nshould it matter whether citizens actually care about the common good?\nSome philosophers in the tradition cite a practical problem. Even in a\nwell-designed arrangement, circumstances are likely to arise where\nsocial institutions do not provide people with an adequate private\nincentive to act in a publicly oriented way. For example, political\nmorality may require public officials to stand up for the rule of law,\neven in situations where this will damage their careers. Or political\nmorality may require citizens to protest against an unjust law, even\nif this means a private risk of being jailed or blacklisted. Political\nmorality may even require citizens to run the risk of losing their\nlives in order to defend the constitutional order against a foreign\nthreat (see Walzer 1970; Rousseau 1762b [1997: 63\u20134]). In each\nof these cases, no matter how well designed institutions are, citizens\nmay not have an adequate private incentive to do what political\nmorality requires, so a genuine concern for the common good may be\nessential.\n\nA different explanation\u2014perhaps the most important one in the\ncommon good tradition\u2014stresses the idea of a social\nrelationship. Think of the relationship between parents and their\nchildren. This relationship requires not only that the people involved\nact in certain ways towards one another, but also that they\ncare about one another in certain ways. For instance, parents\nare required not only to feed and clothe their children, perhaps to\navoid getting fined by the Department of Child and Family Services.\nParents are also required to care about their children: they must give\ntheir children\u2019s interests a certain status in their practical\nreasoning. Many philosophers argue that our relation to our fellow\ncitizens has similar features. The political bond requires not only\nthat we act in certain ways, but also that we give the interests of\nour fellow citizens a certain status in our practical reasoning. It\nwould be unacceptable, on this view, for citizens to fulfill certain\npublic roles purely for the sake of private incentives. A Supreme\nCourt justice, for example, must care about the rule of law and the\ncommon interests that this practice serves. If she were making\nconsistent rulings just to cash her paycheck every two weeks, she\nwould not be responding in the right way to her fellow citizens, who\nact for the sake of common interests in doing things such as voting,\nfollowing the law, and standing ready to defend the constitutional\n order.[9]\n\nMany philosophers believe that there is something morally defective\nabout a private society, even one in which private incentives move\npeople to fill all of the important public roles. A conception of the\ncommon good provides us with an account of what is missing from the\npractical reasoning of citizens in a private society, and it connects\nthis with a wider view about the relational obligations that require\ncitizens to reason in these ways.\n",
