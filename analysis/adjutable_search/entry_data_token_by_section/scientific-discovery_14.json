    "main_text": "Cognitive perspectives on discovery || Kinds and features of creativity\n9.1 Kinds and features of creativity\n\nGeneral definitions of creativity highlight novelty or originality and\nsignificance or value as distinctive features of a creative act or\nproduct (Sternberg & Lubart 1999, Kieran 2014, Paul & Kaufman\n2014b, although see Hills & Bird 2019). Different kinds of\ncreativity can be distinguished depending on whether the act or\nproduct is novel for a particular individual or entirely novel.\nPsychologist Margaret Boden distinguishes between psychological\ncreativity (P-creativity) and historical creativity (H-creativity).\nP-creativity is a development that is new, surprising and important to\nthe particular person who comes up with it. H-creativity, by contrast,\nis radically novel, surprising, and important\u2014it is generated\nfor the first time (Boden 2004). Further distinctions have been\nproposed, such as anthropological creativity (construed as a human\ncondition) and metaphysical creativity, a radically new thought or\naction in the sense that it is unaccounted for by antecedents and\navailable knowledge, and thus constitutes a radical break with the\npast (Kronfeldner 2009, drawing on Hausman 1984). \n\nPsychological studies analyze the personality traits and creative\nindividuals\u2019 behavioral dispositions that are conducive to\ncreative thinking. They suggest that creative scientists share certain\ndistinct personality traits, including confidence, openness,\ndominance, independence, introversion, as well as arrogance and\nhostility. (For overviews of recent studies on personality traits of\ncreative scientists, see Feist 1999, 2006: chapter 5).\n\nRecent work on creativity in philosophy of mind and cognitive science\noffers substantive analyses of the cognitive and neural mechanisms\ninvolved in creative thinking (Abrams 2018, Minai et al 2022) and\ncritical scrutiny of the romantic idea of genius creativity as\nsomething deeply mysterious (Blackburn 2014). Some of this research\naims to characterize features that are common to all creative\nprocesses, such as Thagard and Stewart\u2019s account according to\nwhich creativity results from combinations of representations (Thagard\n& Stewart 2011, but see Pasquale and Poirier 2016). Other research\naims to identify the features that are distinctive of scientific\ncreativity as opposed to other forms of creativity, such as artistic\ncreativity or creative technological invention (Simonton 2014).\n",
