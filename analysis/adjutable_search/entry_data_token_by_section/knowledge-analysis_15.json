Methodological Options\n\nAs our discussion so far makes clear, one standard way of evaluating\nattempted analyses of knowledge has given a central role to testing it\nagainst intuitions against cases. In the late twentieth century, the\nperceived lack of progress towards an acceptable\nanalysis\u2014including the considerations attributed to Zagzebski in\n\u00a77 above\u2014led some epistemologists to pursue other\nmethodological strategies. (No doubt, a wider philosophical trend away\nfrom \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d more broadly also contributed\nto this change.) Some of the more recent attempts to analyse knowledge\nhave been motivated in part by broader considerations about the role\nof knowledge, or of discourse about knowledge.\n\nOne important view of this sort is that defended by Edward Craig\n(1990). Craig\u2019s entry-point into the analysis of knowledge was\nnot intuitions about cases, but rather a focus on the role that the\nconcept of knowledge plays for humans. In particular, Craig suggested\nthat the point of using the category of knowledge was for people to\nflag reliable informants\u2014to help people know whom to trust in\nmatters epistemic. Craig defends an account of knowledge that is\ndesigned to fill this role, even though it is susceptible to intuitive\ncounterexamples. The plausibility of such accounts, with a less\nintuitive extension but with a different kind of theoretical\njustification, is a matter of controversy.\n\nAnother view worth mentioning in this context is that of Hilary\nKornblith (2002), which has it that knowledge is a natural kind, to be\nanalysed the same way other scientific kinds are. Intuition has a role\nto play in identifying paradigms, but generalizing from there is an\nempirical, scientific matter, and intuitive counterexamples are to be\nexpected.\n\nThe \u201cknowledge first\u201d stance is also connected to these\nmethodological issues. See \u00a711 below.\n",
