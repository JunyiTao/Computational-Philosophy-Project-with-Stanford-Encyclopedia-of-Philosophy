Fleck claimed that cognition is a\ncollective activity, since it is only possible on the basis of a\ncertain body of knowledge acquired from other people. When people\nbegin to exchange ideas, a thought collective arises, bonded\nby a specific mood, and as a result of a series of\nunderstandings and misunderstandings a peculiar thought style\nis developed. When a thought style becomes sufficiently sophisticated,\nthe collective divides itself into an esoteric circle\n(professionals) and an exoteric circle (laymen). A thought\nstyle consists of the active elements, which shape ways in\nwhich members of the collective see and think about the world, and of\nthe passive elements, the sum of which is perceived as an\n\u201cobjective reality\u201d. What we call \u201cfacts\u201d, are\nsocial constructs: only what is true to culture is true to nature.\nThought styles are often incommensurable: what is a fact to\nthe members of a thought collective A sometimes does not exist to the\nmembers of a thought collective B, and a thought that is significant\nand true to the members of A may sometimes be false or meaningless for\nmembers of B.\n", "toc": [{"#LifeWork": "1.

Life and Works\n\nLudwik Fleck was born on July 11, 1896, in Lvov (now Lviv), at that\ntime under the rule of Austria-Hungary, to a family of Jewish\ncraftsman. His medical studies at the John Casimir University were\ninterrupted by military service. He graduated in 1922, when Lvov\nbelonged to the reborn Poland. At the end of his studies he was an\nassistant of the famous typhus specialist Rudolf Weigl. In 1923 Fleck\nfounded a private laboratory of medical analysis and was in charge of\nthe Lvov Sick Fund and the bacteriological-chemical laboratories of\nthe General Public Hospital.\n\nAlthough he was only loosely related with any academic environment at\nthat time, Fleck conducted medical research, the results of which he\npublished in about 40 papers, mostly in Polish and in German. In 1927\nhe published in Polish his first work in the philosophy of medicine:\n\u201cSome Specific Features of the Medical Way of Thinking\u201d.\nTwo years later he published in German a paper \u201cOn the Crisis of\n\u2018Reality\u2019\u201d(1929) inspired mostly by the quantum\nrevolution in physics. Both articles are of a provisional character,\nbut the first one already includes the terms \u201cthought\nstyle\u201d and \u201cincommensurability\u201d.\n\nIn September 1933 Fleck sent the manuscript of his book Die\nAnalyse einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache to Moritz Schlick. In\nMarch 1934, Schlick replied and expressed his willingness to recommend\nit for publication under the condition that a specialist on the\nhistory of medicine would also review it positively. In 1935, Benno\nSchwabe finally published the book Entstehung und Entwicklung\neiner wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einf\u00fchrung in die Lehre vom\nDenkstil und Denkkollektiv (The Genesis and Development of a\nScientific Fact: An Introduction to the Theory of Thought Style and\nThought Collective). It was accompanied by a Polish summary of the\nmain theses of the book (1934) and two important papers:\n\u201cScientific Observation and Perception in General\u201d (1935b)\nand \u201cThe Problem of Epistemology\u201d (1936). In Poland the\nbook was criticized by Izydora D\u0105mbska and Fleck answered her\ncritique in (1938). Fleck\u2019s next Polish philosophical article\n(1939a) referred, among others, to a book by a psychiatrist and\nhistorian of medicine, Tadeusz Bilikiewicz. Bilikiewicz replied with a\nmoderate critique of Fleck\u2019s epistemology. Fleck in turn wrote a\npaper \u201cRejoinder to the Comments of Tadeusz Bilikiewicz\u201d\n(1939b) in which he stated strong anti-realistic theses. \n\nWhen Lvov was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1939,\nFleck had been appointed the head of the municipal laboratory of\nhygiene and bacteriology. On June 30, 1941, Lvov was captured by\nGermans. Anti-Jewish pogroms began, and Germans also started to murder\nuniversity professors of Polish origin. Fleck and his wife survived,\nprobably because Rudolf Weigl included him on the list of employees of\nthe Lvov Institute of Research on Typhus and Viruses. In August 1941,\nGermans resettled Fleck to the Lvov ghetto, where he developed and\nproduced an anti-typhus vaccine from the urine of sick people. He was\nthen relocated with his family to the area of the pharmaceutical\ncompany Laokoon and tasked with producing an anti-typhus vaccine for\nGerman soldiers. Finally he and his wife and son were deported to the\nconcentration camp in Auschwitz. At first he was forced to do physical\nlabor, but later he was transferred to the camp\u2019s hospital with\nthe assignment to conduct bacteriological tests on prisoners. In\nDecember 1943 Fleck was transferred to the concentration camp in\nBuchenwald. There a group of prisoners\u2014scientists and medical\ndoctors of various nationalities\u2014led by a scientifically\nilliterate German doctor produced an anti-typhus vaccine.\n\nThe Buchenwald concentration camp was liberated in April 1945. One\nmonth later Fleck found his wife and son in Lvov, which once again\nbelonged to the Soviet Union. They hastily left for Poland, whose\nterritory\u2014by the decision of the Allies\u2014was moved 200 km\nto the west. The Communist government in Poland was establishing Maria\nCurie-Sk\u0142odowska University in Lublin, and since Germans murdered\nmany Polish scholars, there was a scarcity of employable professors.\nIn October 1945 Fleck became the head of the Institute of Medical\nMicrobiology at that university, and he became a full professor in\n1950. In 1948 he testified in the Nuremberg Trials of German doctors,\nwho conducted criminal experiments on prisoners of concentration\ncamps.\n\nHe published two more epistemological papers in Polish:\n\u201cProblems of the Science of Science\u201d (1946) and \u201cTo\nLook, To See, To Know\u201d (1947). Those texts do not add anything\nimportant to the theory which he formulated in the 1930s. He was\nabsorbed by research on a defence mechanism which he discovered in\n1942 and named \u201cleucergy\u201d. It was the chief subject of\nmost of his roughly 80 medical papers which he published in those\nyears, mostly in Polish, but also in English and French. In 1952 he\nbecame the director of the bacteriology and immunology laboratory of\nthe Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw. Fleck was honored with\nmany high national distinctions; he had a company car at his disposal,\nand attended international conferences abroad. In 1954 he became a\nmember of the Polish Academy of Sciences. \n\nWhen Fleck emigrated with his wife to Israel in 1957, where his only\nson had been living for many years, he was already very ill with\ncancer and heart problems. For a few years he was employed in the\nInstitute of Biological Research in Ness Ziona. He then wrote in\nEnglish his last philosophical paper \u201cCrisis in Science. Towards\na Free and More Human Science\u201d, that was rejected by several\nphilosophical journals. Ludwik Fleck died on June 5, 1961, of a second\nheart attack.\n2. Predecessors\n\nIn his epistemological works, Fleck combined: (1) experience of a\nscientist; (2) reflections on the history of medicine; (3)\nphilosophical ideas; and (4) sociological ideas. In the light of his\nown sociology and philosophy of science, one needs first to ask which\nthought collectives he belonged to and what thought styles he\nassimilated.\n\n(1) While working in a private laboratory and hospital Fleck conducted\ncertain medical research, but he remained outside university circles,\nand his research was rather marginal.\n\n(2) In the interwar period Poland was probably the only country where\nfaculties of medicine had chairs for the philosophy and history of\nmedicine (L\u00f6wy 1990). Between 1908 and 1919 W\u0142adys\u0142aw\nSzumowski taught the history of medicine in Lvov. Fleck also had some\nprofessional contact with two philosophers and historians of medicine,\nW\u0142odzimierz Sieradzki and Witold Ziembicki. He was a friend of\nJak\u00f3b Frostig, a philosophizing psychiatrist. It is worth\nmentioning a few remarks from Frostig\u2019s Das schizophrene\nDenken. Ph\u00e4nomenologische Studien zum Problem der widersinnigen\nS\u00e4tze (Leipzig 1929), which can be seen almost without any\nchange among those written by Fleck: \u201cWe mean by [the expression\n\u2018social group\u2019] any group of people bound together by a\ncommon \u2018intention\u2019. Thus the group of mathematicians is a\ngroup of a very special, mathematical mentality. (\u2026) one and\nthe same person can (\u2026) belong to several very different human\ngroups. (\u2026) the group\u2019s collective storehouse ever\nchanges and with it the criteria for truth. (\u2026) It is only in\nrelation to the collective stores of the group in question that we can\ndenote a state of affairs as correct or as a personal error\u201d\n(following Schnelle 1986, p. 9). However, Fleck does not mention any\nof these scholars in his writings, even though they created the\nthought style and intellectual mood that, according to his views, were\nnecessary for his sociology and philosophy of science to emerge. \n\n(3) Before World War II, Lvov had a \u201cphilosophical branch\u201d\nof a distinguished mathematical-philosophical school\u2014the\nLvov-Warsaw School. Despite the fact that Fleck had connections with\nthis school, he never mentioned either Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz or Leon\nChwistek, even though Chwistek\u2019s idea of the multiplicity of\nreality (in art but also in life and science) has much in common with\nhis theory of thought styles. In his writings Fleck makes a few\ncritical remarks on conventionalists and logical empiricists; however,\nnothing really supports the claim that he knew their views well. Also,\nFleck\u2019s remarks on epistemology of Kant, Mach, Wundt and\nUexk\u00fcll\u2019s are superficial and dispersed\u2014he does not\nadopt views from them, but only looks for some superficial\nconfirmation of his own claims. Thus, we cannot include Fleck among\nany esoteric philosophical circles.\n\n(4) In (1935a) Fleck devotes only a few pages to the sociology of\nknowledge, and, moreover, he refers exclusively to the German\ntranslation of Lucien Levy-Bruhl\u2019s book Das Denken der\nNaturv\u00f6lker, 1921 and to Wilhelm Jerusalem\u2019s paper of\n1929. Clearly he did not know works of the \u201cfounders of\nsociology of knowledge\u201d: Max Scheler and Karl Mannheim. Schnelle\n(1986) even claims that Fleck had acquired the basic information on\nthe sociology of science from a popular paper published in Polish by\nPawe\u0142 Rybicki. When Fleck mentions the works of Durkheim, Levy\nBruhl, Jerusalem or Gumplowicz, he does this superficially; he does\nnot adopt any of their conceptions and is content with a general\nthesis that \u201cWhat actually thinks within a person is not the\nindividual himself but his social community\u201d (Gumplowicz; quot.\nfrom Fleck 1935a, \u00a7 II.4). Fleck accuses them of ignoring the\nresults of their research into the beliefs of traditional societies\nonce they turn to scientific thinking, where they hold that\n\u201cperceptions proper\u201d displace mythical elements, and a\ntraditional conviction on the existence of spirits and daemons is\nreplaced with justified beliefs about \u201cwhat physically is\npossible or impossible\u201d (Levy-Bruhl, quot. from Fleck 1935a,\n\u00a7 II.4). In contrast, Fleck claims that scientific thinking is an\nobject of sociological examination to the same extent as mythical\nthinking.\n\nAn interesting hypothesis was recently formulated by Eva Hedfors\n(2006), who critically evaluated Fleck\u2019s competencies in the\nhistory of medicine. She claims that the chief role in the development\nof his thought was played by the interdisciplinary journal Die\nNaturwissenschaften, where on the turn of the 1920s and 1930s\nscientists and philosophers carried out a philosophical debate about\nthe relativistic and quantum revolution in physics. According to\nHedfors this debate inspired Fleck, who wrote on the \u201cphysics of\ntomorrow\u201d:\n\nAt the present time we are so fortunate as to witness the spectacle of\nthe birth, the creation, of a new style of thinking. (\u2026) Sooner\nor later much will change: the law of causality, the concepts of\nobjectivity and subjectivity. Something else will be demanded from\nscientific solutions and different problems will be regarded as\nimportant. Much that has been proven will be found unproven, and much\nof what was never proven will turn out to be superfluous (Fleck 1929).\n\n\nAs Fleck\u2014because of the lack of education in this\narea\u2014could not write about physics, he found corresponding\nepisodes in the history of medicine with which he illustrated theses\ncirculating in the thought collective of physicists who were debating\nwhat was happening in their discipline.\n3. Thought Collectives\n\nImmanuel Kant made us aware that while we learn about nature from\nexperience, in order to do this we have to know something before\nexperiencing anything. According to Kant, a priori synthetic\nknowledge is unchangeable and plays an active role in cognition: our\npicture of the world is formed as much by things in themselves as by\nour forms of perception and categories of thought, and we will never\nknow whether and how that picture is similar to what exists\nindependently of our cognitive acts. Fleck adopted Kant\u2019s thesis\non the active role of cognitive a priori: an empty mind would\nneither perceive nor think. So, before a mind starts to experience,\nand on the basis of experience starts to think, it has to be filled\nwith some initial knowledge. But the quantum revolution in physics has\nshown that there is nothing necessary or unchangeable in a\npriori forms and categories. A non-Kantian explanation of the\norigins of cognitive a priori was badly needed.\n\nAccording to Fleck, the basic phenomenon we have to accept in order to\nbuild the edifice of epistemology is the collective mental\ndifferentiation of men (1936, II). People perceive and think\ndifferently, but those differences concern groups rather than\nindividuals. So we speak of various ways of perceiving and thinking\nabout stars and planets by astronomers, by astrologists, by\ntheologians or by mystics. Those people understand each other very\nwell within their groups: an astronomer understands another astronomer\nwell, and an astrologist another astrologist; but between\ngroups\u2014like between an astrologist and an astronomer\u2014there\nis usually no understanding.\n\nCognition is a collective activity. It is confusing just to say that\nan individual X got to know a phenomenon P: one should say that\n\u201cX got to know P in the thought style S from the epoch E\u201d\n(1936, V)\u2014yet the thought style S from the epoch E is a product\nof a certain thought collective to which X belongs. What to a stubborn\nmetaphysician appears as necessary forms of thinking results from the\nsocial nature of cognition:\n\nA truly isolated investigator is impossible (\u2026). An isolated\ninvestigator without bias and tradition, without forces of mental\nsociety acting upon him, and without the effect of the evolution of\nthat society, would be blind and thoughtless. Thinking is a collective\nactivity (\u2026). Its product is a certain picture, which is\nvisible only to anybody who takes part in this social activity, or a\nthought which is also clear to the members of the collective only.\nWhat we do think and how we do see depends on the thought-collective\nto which we belong (1935b).\n\n\nA thought collective is defined by Fleck as a community of\npersons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining intellectual\ninteraction (1935a, II.4). Members of that collective not only adopt\ncertain ways of perceiving and thinking, but they also continually\ntransform it\u2014and this transformation does occur not so much\n\u201cin their heads\u201d as in their interpersonal space. It is\neasy to observe this phenomenon in everyday life. When a group of\npeople speak about something important, they start to speak about\nthings which would not cross their minds if they were alone and which\nthey would not tell if they were in another group of people. There\narises a thought style characteristic for that group. There\nalso arises a certain collective mood which straightens up\nthe ties among the group members and inclines them to act in a certain\nway.\n\nSome collectives last shortly\u2014even only as long as an individual\nconversation lasts. When social forces connecting people operate for a\nlong time, there arise thought collectives lasting for many\ngenerations. They take forms of religious movements, folk traditions,\nart or science. Long-lasting collectives create social institutions\nwhich enable and regulate the method by which next generations are\nadded to a given collective: educational systems and social rituals\naccompanying the admission of new members.\n\nAll members of small ethnic groups belong to the same thought\ncollective: everybody perceives and thinks in the same way, just like\neverybody performs the same or very similar actions. Within more\ndeveloped societies there are many various collectives: religious,\nartistic, scientific, astrological, and those related to fashion,\npolitics, economy, medicine, quack, sport, etc. When a thought style,\ndeveloped and employed by a collective, becomes sufficiently\nsophisticated, the collective breaks into a small esoteric\ncircle\u2014a group of specialists which \u201care in the\nknow\u201d\u2014and a wide exoteric circle for all those\nmembers, who are under the influence of the style, but do not play an\nactive role in its formation. Members of the first group are those\n\u201cinitiated\u201d\u2014priests and theologians in the case of\nreligion; artists and art critics in the case of art; scientists in\nthe case of science etc. The corresponding exoteric circles for those\ngroups are: lay believers; art-lovers; school teachers of physics,\nchemistry, and biology, and also engineers and all people interested\nin science.\n\nExoteric circles have an access to a proper thought style only through\nesoteric circles\u2014for example through listening to sermons given\nby priests, or reading popular literature written by scientists.\nMembers of exoteric circles trust the initiated. But specialists and\nmembers of esoteric circles are not independent of exoteric circles:\nthis is the \u201cpublic opinion\u201d which justifies the efforts\nof specialists and gives them a stimulus to continue their work.\n\nIn contemporary societies almost everybody belongs to many thought\ncollectives; e.g. a scientist may be also a member of a certain\nchurch, political party, mountain climbing club. An individual usually\nbelongs to distant thought collectives, so that conflicts between\nthought styles coexisting in him/her do not arise. Most of people\nbelong only to exoteric circles; only few become members of any\nesoteric circle, sporadically belonging to more than one. Everybody\nalso belongs to a wide \u201ceveryday life\u201d collective (which\nalso differs from culture to culture).\n\nWithin the esoteric circle Fleck distinguishes the following\nsubgroups: (1) vanguard, \u201cthe group of scientists working\npractically on a given problem\u201d, (2) the main body, \u201cthe\nofficial community\u201d, and (3) the group of stragglers (1935a,\nIV,4). In other places he omits stragglers and introduces a\ndistinction between professionals (specialists sensu stricto)\nand more general specialists (1936, VI).\n4. Collective Moods\n\nMembers of a thought collective naturally possess a certain bond, some\nfeeling of group solidarity, of being a \u201ccomrade\u201d,\n\u201ccoreligionist\u201d, \u201ccountryman\u201d, or\n\u201ccolleague\u201d. It is accompanied by the feeling of hostility\nor contempt to a \u201cstranger\u201d, who worships other gods, is\nguided by other values, or uses unfamiliar words etc.\n\nThe force which maintains the collective and unites its members is\nderived from the community of the collective mood. This mood\nproduces the readiness for an identically directed perception,\nevaluation and use of what is perceived, i.e. a common thought-style\n(1936, V).\n\n\nThese are collective moods which induce members of collectives both to\nsacrifice themselves for others and to burn dissenters at stakes. They\nmake scientists work for public enlightenment, and at the same time\nthey arouse the feeling of disdain for astrologists or alchemists.\n\nFleck stresses that there is no thinking which is free from emotions:\n\u201cThere is only agreement or difference between feelings, and the\nuniform agreement in the emotions of a society is, in its content,\ncalled freedom from emotions\u201d (1935a, II.4). Emotions have a\nsocial character; they are already hidden in a language employed by a\ncollective. Technical terms not only denote something determined by\ntheir definitions, but they also encompass \u201ca certain specific\npower, being not only a name but also a slogan\u201d, they have\n\u201ca specific thought-charm\u201d. This is why once the members\nof an esoteric circle master technical terminology there appears a\nsense of mission, and joining such a circle itself has \u201cthe\nvalue of the sacrament of initiation\u201d (1936, V).\n\nIf the position of an elite is stronger than the position of the\nmasses, the elite isolates itself and demands obedience from the\nmasses. Such collectives develop dogmatic styles of thinking in which\na test of correctness is usually located in some distant past in a\nmore or less mythical master or savior. Collective life acquires a\nceremonial character and access to the esoteric circle is\nwell-guarded. Conservatism reigns: there is no place for fundamentally\nnew ideas, and one can only better or worse realize the revealed\nprinciples. This is characteristic of most religious collectives.\n\nIf the position of the masses is stronger than that of an\nelite\u2014like in scientific collectives\u2014the elite endeavors\nafter trust and appreciation of the masses, pledging its commitment to\nserve common good. This collective has a democratic character: the\ntest of correctness is \u201cthe recognition by everybody\u201d.\nEverybody is encouraged to learn, and everybody who meets intellectual\nstandards can become a member of the esoteric circle. \u201cThis\nobligation is also expressed in the democratically equal regard for\nanybody that acquires knowledge. All research workers, as a matter of\nprinciple, are regarded as possessing equal rights\u201d (1935a,\nIV.5). In principle every man\u2014not only an elite with special\nprivileges\u2014should be able to verify whether a statement is true,\nto repeat an experiment conducted by somebody else etc.\n\nHere an unsolvable problem arises. General education, necessary for\njoining a scientific collective, is acquired in schools before\nmaturing, and if this is not achieved an individual is practically\ndoomed to remain outside the scientific collective. In science no\ntransfers from the uneducated general public to the body of general\nspecialists occur. However, a democratic respect for an (imagined)\n\u201canybody\u201d grants scientific thought styles an impersonal\ncharacter which in turn leads to the objectivization of collectively\ncreated thought structures. Objective truth expressed clearly and\nprecisely becomes an ideal. Of course, this ideal is to be realized in\nsome distant (maybe even infinite) future. However, even if a\nresearcher herself is removed from the results of her work, a cult of\nscientific heroes and geniuses devoted to scientific service\ndevelops.\n\nPart of a collective mood arises at the point of contact between\nesoteric and exoteric circles. On the one hand, members of exoteric\ncircles usually trust professionals and they admire them. On the other\nhand esoteric circles act under pressure of expectations of the\nmasses. When a certain domain lacks support from outside, it does not\nhave significant achievements. Fleck here uses an analogy of sand\ncarried by the wind. A rock sometimes hits its target and sometimes it\ndoes not, whereas sand carried by the wind unavoidably accumulates in\nhollows (1935a, III). So when some social pressure makes enough\nresearchers work long enough on a certain issue and obtain sufficient\nmaterial support, they finally arrive at more or less satisfying\nresults. A condition of success is not the alleged truth of employed\ntheories but the systematicity of research.\n5. Genesis and Development of a Thought Style and of Facts\n\nThe democratically equal regard for everybody makes scientists write\npopular works to familiarize laypersons\u2014as far as it is\npossible\u2014with a current state of knowledge. They use widely\nunderstood common language full of imprecise expressions and\nmetaphors. Since popular texts cannot include complications which a\nprofessional meets every day in her work and because an author speaks\nto the public as an authority, such books and articles have a dogmatic\ncharacter. Instead of provisions like \u201cit seems that\u201d,\n\u201cas we tried to prove\u201d often present in scientific papers,\nin popular works there are expressions like \u201cit is a fact\nthat\u201d or \u201cas science has proven\u201d. This has serious\n(although not intended) effects on the development of science itself,\nfor those who are to become scientists in future have their first\ncontact with a discipline precisely through popular readings. Thus,\nwhat was created by a group of people acquires an impersonal,\nautonomous character. \u201cSocial distance transforms the author\nfrom a creator to a discoverer\u201d\u2014and this is how a mythical\nideal of knowledge \u201cas representation of reality independent of\nthe subject of cognition\u201d (1936, VI) arises.\n\nOne should then start to read textbooks and experiment under the\nsupervision of specialists. This introduction into a domain still has\na dogmatic character. An individual\u2019s mind is introduced\n\u201cinto a self-contained world\u201d and acquires a peculiar\nmystagogy. Finally, some people become fully-fledged members of a\nthought collective of a scientific discipline\u2014specialists:\n\u201cthe expert is already a specially molded individual who can no\nlonger escape the bonds of tradition and of the collective; otherwise\nhe would not be an expert\u201d (1935a, III).\n\nAs a specialist she starts to face certain research problems. She does\nnot face them alone: she is a member of a group, where everybody\nperceives the world similarly and thinks about it in (almost) the same\nway. And if an issue is new, then any success is achievable only if\nthe whole group of scholars is engaged. Usually the analyzed phenomena\nare extremely complicated and diversified\u2014and they require\ndistinguishing, segregation, unification, and simplification, and\nthose are tasks which exceed the capabilities of any single\nresearcher. \u201cOnly through organized cooperative research,\nsupported by popular knowledge and continuing over several\ngenerations, might a unified picture emerge\u201d (1935a, II.1).\n\nWe do not only mean here that there is too much work to do. When\nphenomena are not sufficiently examined, we lack concepts by means of\nwhich we could adequately describe them. And we also cannot begin with\ngathering facts. Traditionally\u2014and today some still think\nso\u2014facts were considered to be what is given and accessible\nthrough the senses. Modern empiricists claimed that there is nothing\nin the mind that was not first in the senses. Fleck reversed this\nmaxim: there is nothing in the senses that was not first in the mind.\nSo, in order to perceive we have to learn something before. It is not\nso that we first see some moving dashes and then we compose a whole of\nthem. Quite the contrary:\n\nWe walk around without seeing any points, lines, angles, light or\nshadows, from which we would have to arrange \u201cwhat is\nthis\u201d by synthesis or reasoning, but we see at once a house, a\nmemorial in a square, a detachment of soldiers, a bookshop window, a\ngroup of children, a lady with a dog, all of them ready forms.\n(\u2026) We look with our own eyes, but we see with the eyes of the\ncollective body, we see the forms whose sense and range of permissible\ntranspositions is created by the collective body (1947, II).\n\n\nThis set of forms was transferred to an individual in the process of\nsocialization. When we bring a layperson to a laboratory and we ask\nher to describe a course of scientific experiments, professionals will\nfind out immediately that she is not able to do this. She will surely\ncreate a long description and bring up a lot of unimportant or\naccidental details, but she will not pay attention to what is\nimportant from a scientist\u2019s point of view. \u201cIf we wanted\nnecessarily to render his experience in words, the most appropriate\nslogan would be: \u2018I search\u2019 or \u2018I have a\nchaos\u2019\u201d (1935b). An expert sees differently than a\nlayperson because she went through a special training during which she\nwas familiarized with many examples\u2014e.g. symptoms of a given\ndisease and at the same time symptoms of other diseases (so with what\nX is and what X is not). At the same time she was\nequipped with a certain set of views on what that disease is, on the\ncourse of it, on how it is affected by external conditions etc. Thus,\nif the training process is successful a new member of a collective\nwill directly see the same as what other members see \u201cwith their\nown eyes\u201d. As Fleck states in the last sentence of (1935b),\n\u201c\u2019To see\u2019 means: to recreate, at a suitable moment,\na picture created by the mental collective to which one\nbelongs\u201d.\n\nHowever, when a specialist starts research on phenomena of a new kind\nshe is in the same situation as a layperson: she does not know what\nand how to observe. She does not recognize certain forms, she\nexperiences chaos in which it is very hard to grasp anything constant.\nThis is why\u2014as it was mentioned above\u2014scholars cannot\nstart from gathering experimental data. Fleck also stresses that there\nis no spontaneous creation of concepts (1935a, II.1). This is why a\nnew research starts usually\u2014although not always\u2014from\nproto-ideas which often are of a religious or philosophical character,\nwhich had existed centuries before they acquired a scientific\ncharacter. For example, long before Copernicus there was a proto-idea\nof a heliocentric system, before Lavoisier\u2014a proto-idea of\nchemical elements, before Dalton\u2014a proto-idea of atom, and\nbefore Leeuwenhoek\u2014a proto-idea of microbe (1935a, II.2).\nProto-ideas are vague, and therefore in the scientific understanding\nthey cannot be considered as true or false. (Even though they were\ntrue for the members of corresponding thought collectives). But they\ncan become a point of departure for investigation.\n\nInquiries cannot be conducted by an isolated researcher, for she would\nchase her tail endlessly by repeating old formulas. As we have\nmentioned before, the constitution of a research collective is\nnecessary and it happens when an appropriate mood arises\u2014a mood\nwhich unites people and makes them work. In the case of research that\nwas analyzed by Fleck, i.e., the research which led to the discovery\nof Wassermann\u2019s reaction, the source of an appropriate mood was\nsocial pressure\u2014a common demand for effective means for curing\nsyphilis which was considered as an embarrassing and\nreputation-damaging disease. (Fleck brought forward a controversial\nclaim that the absence of any analogous success in the struggle with\ntuberculosis was related to a common approach to tuberculosis as\n\u201cromantic\u201d, which in turn resulted with insufficient\nsocial pressure to overcome it.) This made the German government join\nthe process of organizing research teams in that area; an additional\nreason was to make achievements of German scientists outmatch\nachievements of other nations. \u201cThe mood gave a driving power,\nand the proto-idea\u2014the direction\u201d (1934).\n\nIf a group of people participate in a research program there occurs a\npeculiar process. Each member of the group reads different texts (both\npopular and professional), participates in different experiments, and\nbelongs to more or less different thought collectives (both scientific\nand non-scientific). So, when they start speaking to each other and\nreading each other\u2019s papers, a series of misunderstandings\narises. Ideas circulate within a collective and are enriched by new\nassociations, and therefore the words that are used change their\nmeanings. Sometimes nothing is left of the original meanings intended\nby those participating in the exchange of ideas. Sometimes the changes\nstem from a clash of various proto-ideas. And that clash itself is a\nresult of various social factors. Having conducted countless studies\nand conversations and embarked upon a long journey, the scholars\nfinally create a thought style which nobody intended. And after this\nhas happened, nobody post factum knows when and how that\nstyle started to operate and who, specifically, created it.\n\nThoughts pass from one individual to another, each time a little\ntransformed, for each individual can attach to them somewhat different\nassociations. Strictly speaking, the receiver never understands the\nthought exactly in the way that the transmitter intended it to be\nunderstood. After a series of such encounters, practically nothing is\nleft of the original content. Whose thought is it that continues to\ncirculate? It is one that obviously belongs not to any single\nindividual but to the collective (1935a, II.4).\n\n\nOf course this process\u2014an important element of which are\nmisunderstandings among researchers\u2014cannot be logically\nreconstructed.\n\nTogether with the mutation of ideas, new forms recognized in\nsensations occur. First, when observing phenomena of a new kind one\nreaches for the set of known forms\u2014and starts to recognize that\nthis, what is new, sometimes and under a certain respect resembles\nwhat is known, but some other times and under other respects it is\ndifferent. In this period descriptions of results of experiments are\nfull of comparisons with what one earlier learned to perceive, but\nalso are full of provisions that those comparisons are sometimes\nunreliable. The unreliability manifests itself in the unrepeatability\nof initial experiments: something goes differently than before, and we\nknow neither why it was so, nor what to do in order to get the same\nresult next time. This raises concerns and the readiness for change. A\nresearcher acting more or less blindly, searches for some constraints\nof thought:\n\nThe work of the research scientist means that in the complex confusion\nand chaos which he faces, he must distinguish that which obeys his\nwill from that which arises spontaneously and opposes it. This is the\nfirm ground that he, as representative of the thought collective,\ncontinuously seeks (1935a, IV.2).\n\n\nChanges in the way of seeing cannot\u2014as it was said\nbefore\u2014be made by an individual. Descriptions of experiments\ncirculate among scientists, and again as a result of misunderstandings\nand understandings the traditional forms are (and this fact is not\nnoticed by the participants of that process) restyled, some are\nrejected, other connected into unique wholes, \u201cand, finally, a\nnew readiness is formed, i.e. the readiness to see a new, specific\nform\u201d (1935b). Finally, in descriptions published in\nprofessional papers comparisons disappear and one states: this and\nthat was observed. (Similarly, after some time of being in contact\nwith the Latin alphabet we directly recognize the letter A despite the\nenormous variety of shapes it exists in, and at the same time we are\nnot able to say what this recognizing consists in, cf. Fleck 1947,\nI.)\n\nThus, it is impossible to see something radically new \u201csimply\nand immediately\u201d: first the constrains of an old thought style\nmust be removed and a new style must emerge, a collective\u2019s\nthought mood must change\u2014and this takes time and work with\nothers. In the course of interpersonal exchange concepts evolve and\nfacts evolve together with them. This in turn stimulates creation of\nnew concepts.\n\nBoth thinking and facts are changeable, if only because changes in\nthinking manifest themselves in changed facts. Conversely,\nfundamentally new facts can be discovered only through new thinking\n(1935a, II.4).\n\n\nSometimes new ideas come from unexpected directions and without any\nrelation to science itself. This is how Fleck explains the discovery\nof spermatozoon which happened together with the fall of political\nabsolutism and popularization of the idea of individual freedom\nunderstood mainly as freedom of personal movement. One could not\ndiscover spermatozoon just looking through a microscope. However\nsomeone, who thought about a free person, could notice freely\nmoving\u2014so \u201cfree\u201d\u2014spermatozoa (1939a). This was\nthe influence of environment which created a restless mood necessary\nfor searching for something new. And a new mode of thinking created in\na different domain of life allowed one to perceive, distinguish, and\ndescribe it in a way which would stimulate reflections of\nothers\u2014those participating in revolutionary social changes as\nwell.\n\nBefore new sensual and thought forms arise, a certain \u201cspecific\nintellectual unrest must arise and a change of the moods of the\nthought collective\u201d (1935b). If a person makes an important\ndiscovery but social moods do not change, she will not find people who\ntake up her ideas and continue research. On the other hand facts are\nmutually dependent on each other, so \u201ceach new fact\nharmoniously\u2014though even so slightly\u2014changes all earlier\nfacts\u201d (1935a, IV.3). As a result, it sometimes happens that\nthose initial observations from which a certain research began does\nnot belong to the same class of facts as the one emerging from that\nresearch. (The research on the variability of bacteria was initiated\nby observations made in 1906 by Neisser and Massini, which today are\nregarded as bacteriophage effects.) Sometimes nothing remains of the\nproto-ideas from which investigations started and which inspired early\nexperimental work. (Like the proto-idea of syphilis blood has nothing\nto do with contemporary Wassermann\u2019s reaction). And finally\nthere arises the edifice of knowledge which was neither intended nor\nforeseen by anybody.\n\nIn this process there is nothing necessary; various accidental\ncircumstances decide which ideas become a basis for investigation and\nare disseminated within a collective; which meetings between\nscientists happen; which research projects acquire social support;\nwhich experiments are conducted first etc. Fleck claims that if e.g.\nSigle\u2019s idea of protozoa-like structures as the causative agent\nof syphilis had acquired sufficient support, we would have reached a\nharmonious system of knowledge different from the current one. The\nscope of the name \u201csyphilis\u201d would have been somewhat\ndifferent than it is today, just like the methods of research and\ntherapy would. But when a certain thought style develops and dominates\nresearchers\u2019 minds, alternative ways of development become\nclosed. Summing up this idea Fleck claims that most\u2014and maybe\neven the whole\u2014content of scientific knowledge is conditioned by\nhistorical, psychological and sociological factors and one has to\nconsider them when attempting to explain that content (1935a,\nII.1).\n\nOf course, a series of misunderstandings is not enough to create a\nthought style that connects everybody. This is why for the existence\nof a certain discipline the main body of an esoteric circle is\nnecessary\u2014the group composed of general specialists well\nprepared to choose among propositions of the vanguard those that are\nmost useful, and to elaborate, employ and harmonize them with each\nother. I.e. to create from a set of provisional claims present in\npapers aimed at professionals a system and to pass it on to a next\ngeneration of researchers. This occurs when textbooks are created.\n\n(\u2026) a judgment about the existence or non-existence of a\nphenomenon belongs, in a democratic collective, to a numerous council,\nnot to an individual. The textbook changes the subjective judgment of\nan author into a proven fact. It will be united with the entire system\nof science, it will henceforward be recognized and taught, it will\nbecome a foundation of further facts and the guiding principle of what\nwill be seen and applied (1936, VI).\n\n\nThe social structure of a scientific thought collective is reflected\nin types of scientific literature. Papers in scientific journals are\nwritten by scientists working practically on a given problem and are\naimed at other scientists. More general specialists write textbooks\nconsolidating their esoteric circle and educating its new members.\nPopular works are directed to exoteric circles.\n\nThe victory of a thought style depends on whether it will be possible\nto have a next generation of its followers, and to prevent influences\nof other styles. Certain research problems should be propagated, and\nother should be removed. A certain mental readiness must be created\namong the adepts of science. When it is achieved, all researchers\n\u201cwill see the new form directly, with their own eyes, as if it\nwere the only one, everlasting truth, independent of the people\u201d\n(1935b). At the end of his life Fleck summarized this as follows:\n\nEvery cognition is a social act (\u2026) for during every lasting\nexchange of thoughts there appear and grow ideas and standards which\nare not associated with any individual author. A communal mode of\nthinking develops which binds all participants, and certainly\ndetermines every act of cognition. Therefore, cognition must be\nconsidered as a function of three components: it is a relation between\nthe individual subject, the certain object and the given community of\nthinking (Denkkollektiv), within which the subject acts; it\nworks only when a certain style of thinking (Denkstil),\noriginating in the given community is used (1986).\n\n\nThe victory of a given thought style is never ultimate. Each new\nexperimental discovery and every theoretical idea more or less changes\nthe whole system. Even if at the beginning one sees only what\ncorresponds with the theory, after a while there appear complications\nand exceptions (Kuhn\u2019s anomalies) which sooner or later leads to\nrevisions of concepts and assumptions. \u201cMutations\u201d in a\nthought style, such as contemporary transformations in physics or in\nbacteriology, constantly occur. Sooner or later we will have to change\ne.g. the law of conservation of energy (1935a, II.1) and any other\nconcept and claim. In the historical development of science there is\nnothing determined once and for all, nothing invariant. Both thinking\nand facts change.\n6. Active and Passive Elements of a Thought Style\n\nFleck defines a thought style as the readiness for directed\nperception, with corresponding mental and objective assimilation of\nwhat has been so perceived, characterized by specific problems of\ninterest, by judgments which the thought collective considers evident\nand by methods which are applied as a means of cognition (1935a,\nIV.3). What was collectively developed plays an active role in\ncognition: shapes modes of perception and the thinking of members of a\nthought collective. An individual, who has assimilated a certain\nthought style, becomes passive when conducting standard research:\nrecognizes in environment specific forms and draws\nspecific\u2014those and no other\u2014conclusions from an\nassimilated theory and results of experimental research.\n\nCognition therefore means, primarily, to ascertain those results that\nmust follow, given certain preconditions. The preconditions correspond\nto active linkages and constitute that portion of cognition belonging\nto the collective. The constrained results correspond to passive\nlinkages and constitute that which is experienced as objective\nreality. The act of ascertaining is the contribution of the individual\n(1935a, II.4).\n\n\nThe occurrence of passive elements cannot be explained sociologically.\nThey are, so to speak, results of employing a conceptual measure which\nresulted from historical and cultural circumstances to the results of\nexperiments\u2014which, as the title of Fleck\u2019s book says, came\nto existence together with the creation of a new though style and are\ndeveloped with it.\n\nWhat Fleck calls active elements of a thought style, Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 calls \u201cprinciples\u201d and sees as\n\u201cdisguised definitions\u201d. Poincar\u00e9 stresses that\nthere is nothing necessary in definitions\u2014they can be various\nand they are chosen for pragmatic and aesthetic reasons. Fleck agrees\nwith him to a certain extent. He notices that in the 19th century\nsyphilis was defined in many ways: as a carnal scourge, as a\nmercury-treated decease, and finally as a set of typical symptoms. And\nhe claims that \u201c(\u2026) if syphilis can be defined in various\nways, the definition selected still determines some conclusions.\n(\u2026) there are some associations which are open to choice\n(\u2026) and others that are constrained\u201d (1935a, I). For\nexample if one defined syphilis as a \u201ccarnal scourge\u201d,\nthen other diseases like gonorrhea, soft chancre, etc. would be cases\nof syphilis; and when proper experiments had been conducted one stated\nfor example that \u201csometimes mercury does not cure the carnal\nscourge but makes it even worse\u201d. Looking at the same experiment\nthose who defined syphilis as a disease which can be treated with\nmercury would conclude that they are not dealing with syphilis.\nHowever, Fleck opposes the conventionalist idea that definitions can\nbe chosen freely. Definitions are born with the birth of a thought\nstyle, and their formulation is determined by both historical-cultural\nconditioning and by the process of exchanging ideas among researchers\nwhich was described above. A mature thought style is a system where\ndefinitions mutually condition each other and where accepting a\ncertain definition can prevent accepting some other ones.\n\nThe distinction between active and passive elements is still not\nclear. Some examples are obvious: if 16 is assumed\u2014on the basis\nof some arbitrary convention\u2014as the atomic weight for oxygen,\nthe atomic weight of hydrogen will necessary be 1.008. \u201cThis\nmeans that the ratio of the two weights is a passive element of\nknowledge\u201d (1935a, IV.1). However, as an active element of\nknowledge Fleck indicates also \u201cthe mere use of alcohol in\npreparing extracts\u201d, adding however that \u201cthe actual\nusefulness of such extracts is a passive one and therefore a necessary\nconsequence\u201d. He also writes that the concepts of chemical\nelement and of atom are derived \u201cfrom collective\nimagination\u201d, but \u201cthe usefulness of these concepts in\nchemistry (\u2026) is really independent of the individual\nknower\u201d. The active and passive elements of knowledge are\ninseparable either historically or logically, and every statement can\nbe divided into active and passive part.\n\nBoth kinds of elements can be found in each thought style, and also in\nmythical and religious thinking. In one place Fleck notices that\nwhereas a myth has little passive elements, the characteristic feature\nof science is that it attempts to add as many passive elements as it\ncan to its system. Fleck never developed this idea, and this is\nunfortunate, for this could be his contribution to the solution of the\nproblem of demarcation. There are some places where he makes remarks\ncomplementing argumentation developed in the last chapter: \u201cWhat\nhas previously been classed with the passive elements of knowledge may\nlater join the active ones\u201d (1935a, IV.2). We should regret\nagain that he did not develop the idea which could contribute to\nunderstanding the mechanism of those transformations which Kuhn later\ncalled \u201cscientific revolutions\u201d. For it suggests that not\nonly pre-scientific proto-ideas, but also passive results obtained\nwithin an old scientific thought style can serve as a starting point\nfor constructing a new one.\n7. How a Thought Collective Transforms What Is Socially Constructed Into \u201cReality\u201d?\n\nAs explained above, what and how we see and what and how we think\ndepends on a collectively created thought style assimilated through\ncontacts with others. However,\n\nThe individual within the collective is never, or hardly ever,\nconscious of the prevailing thought style, which almost always exerts\nan absolutely compulsive force upon his thinking and with which it is\nnot possible to be at variance (1935a, II.4).\n\n\nIt is peculiar that those who participate in social creation of a\nthought style do not sometimes realize it either. After years they do\nnot remember that once they perceived and thought differently, and\nthey recall their research not as a winding road, full of turns, blind\nsteps, successes resulting from compensation of accidental errors,\netc. And above all they do not record in their memory those moments\nwhen new ideas appeared as a result of misunderstandings between\nresearchers. Fleck compares Wassermann\u2019s texts from different\nperiods and his memories on the road which his team took and which\nfinally led him to the discovery of reaction that now carries his\nname. This comparison shows that after years Wassermann did not\nrealize how in the past, during collective debates and research, facts\nand meanings of words, research problems and methods of solving them\nhad changed. \u201c(\u2026) after fifteen years an identification\nbetween results and intentions had taken place in Wassermann\u2019s\nthinking. The meandering process of development (\u2026) had become\na straight, goal-directed path\u201d (1935a, III).\n\nScientists also do not see the changes of facts and concepts that had\nhappened in their discipline. Since they perceive the world\ndifferently than their predecessors and they think on the basis of\ndifferent assumptions, they are not able to understand the meanings of\nwords from old texts. They do not know that in the past one not so\nmuch thought differently (for incorrectly) about what they now think\nabout, and perceived differently (for incorrectly) what they perceive,\nas one thought of and perceived something else. They instinctively\nunderstand old books and papers according to their own thought style\nand consider those texts as steps\u2014although sometimes\nerroneous\u2014towards this world-view which they possess now.\n\nThe next aspect of social nature of cognition is the phenomenon that\nmembers of a thought collective mutually reinforce themselves in the\nconviction that their thought style is true. Members of religious\ncommunities under group pressure do not consider their faith as one of\nmany, but as the definite truth; they do not consider the principles\nof conduct which their faith imposes on them as the principles of one\nof many ways of living, but as those grasping of the essence of\nmorality etc. Also scientists are convinced that their thought style\nis at least partially true today, and with time, when they work\ntogether, it will get closer and closer to being true. Yet, one may\nsay, the conviction as to the truth of a thought style can break down\nunder the pressure of facts that contradict it, and also as a result\nof confrontation with those who think differently. The remarks given\nabove quite clearly show that this is not the case. Nonetheless let us\nsummarize Fleck\u2019s views on those matters.\n\n\n\nA thought style is included already in meanings of words, and those\nmeanings are considered by members of the collective not as something\nformed by people but as \u201cobjective\u201d. Thus, opposing a\nsystem is unthinkable: someone who opposes it is considered to be the\none who does not understand meanings of the words used (1935a, IV.5;\n1936, VI).\n\n\nScientific instruments which embody some results of a thought style,\n\u201cdirect our thinking automatically on to the tracks of that\nstyle\u201d (1936, VI).\n\n\nForming our cognitive activity, our perception and thinking,\n\u201c[c]ognition modifies the knower so as to adapt him harmoniously\nto his acquired knowledge\u201d (1935a, IV.2). Since everybody sees\nthe world in a way imposed by one\u2019s thought style, in every step\none notices facts corresponding with that style and does not notice\nwhat does not fit active assumptions of it.\n\n\nEven if facts incoherent with a given thought style are noticed, one\nignores them as unimportant. For example, for several decades\nphysicists knew that Mercury had not moved as it should according to\nNewton\u2019s mechanics, but they failed to mention this fact to the\ngeneral public. Only today one precisely describes those facts because\nthey confirm a new thought style: the general theory of relativity\n(1935a, II.3).\n\n\nCognitive problems we choose to solve do not come from a neutral\nreservoir of problems which existed prior to the development of\nsciences, but we choose those which are born on the ground of a\nthought style imposed on us\u2014and they are usually successfully\nsolved within its confines. And we do not work with problems which are\nborn within other styles\u2014our collective considers them not\nworthy of attention or even senseless (1935a, IV.3).\n\n\nWhen anomalies can be no longer ignored, one attempts to show that\nthey are not incompatible with one\u2019s thought style (1935a,\nII.3). (Today we would say one adds to the system various ad\nhoc hypotheses.)\n\n\nSometimes in old texts we find descriptions of results of experiments\nwhich we, as the users of another thought style, consider illusions.\nIt happens that somebody sees something what corresponds with\nprevailing views and other members of a collective confirm his\nexperiences (1935a, II.3).\n\n\nSo it is not possible to compare a theory with \u201creality in\nitself\u201d. It is true that those who use a thought style give\narguments for their views, but those arguments are of restricted\nvalue. Any attempt to legitimize a particular view is inextricably\nbound to standards developed within a given style, and those who\naccept those standards accept also the style. So legitimization is\nactually unnecessary, for it occurs within a collective with more or\nless similar education and a thought-stylized intellectual\nconstitution. \u201cIn science, as in art and in life, only that\nwhich is true to culture is true to nature\u201d (1935a, II.3).\n\nOne may however insist, that not only reality exists but also other\npeople with other thought styles. Can they not convince us that our\nthought style is erroneous? No\u2014for every human thinks that those\nwho belong to the same thought collective as she does are\n\u201cnormal\u201d and authoritative, and everybody else is\ndisregarded as more or less \u201cabnormal\u201d (1938). Since\neverybody\u2019s attention is directed at members of one\u2019s\ncollective, one finds confirmation of one\u2019s own views\neverywhere. Moreover, the conviction that we have possessed truth is\nempowered by the circulation of thoughts between esoteric and exoteric\ncircles. Laymen accept a specialist\u2019s opinion as revelation, and\nwhen that opinion returns from laypersons to the specialist, she\nconsiders it the people\u2019s voice confirming her achievements.\n\nWhen members of various thought collectives meet, a peculiar\nphenomenon occurs. One sees passive elements in one\u2019s thought\nstyle, but the active ones remain almost unnoticed. However,\n\u201cany alien thought style appears like a free flight of fancy,\nbecause he can see only that which is active and almost arbitrary\nabout it\u201d (1935a, IV.5). Since passive results obtained within\nanother thought style appear to her as erroneous \u2013 as they are\nbuilt on an arbitrary and false basis\u2014she is not able to see\ntheir merits and does not understand that people thinking differently\nsuccessfully use their own world view. This leads us to the phenomenon\ncalled \u201cincommensurability\u201d.\n8. Incommensurability of Thought Styles and the Problem of Truth\n\nAs explained above, when people with different thought styles meet,\nthey do not fully understand each other, and at the same time one\nperson thinks that the other is a fool and heretic. Fleck, using\nexamples from the history of medicine, shows that such a lack of\nunderstanding manifests itself not only where a physicist and a\nmetaphysician or astrologer meet, but also when today\u2019s\nscientists read works of their ancestors from the distant past. (Just\nlike Kuhn Fleck does not think that the history of physics as science\nstarted with Galileo and Newton, and the history of scientific\nchemistry with Lavoisier.) For us the views of medieval scholars seem\nfantastic, unjustified, useless, so \u201cnon-scientific\u201d. But\nwhat would happen if they read our \u201cscientific\u201d\ndissertations? They would probably consider them artificial,\narbitrary, meaningless. They understood each other well and together\ndeveloped their thought styles. Just like our views allow us to deal\nwith necessities of life, \u201ctheological\u201d views allowed our\nancestors to organize life and gave them an understanding of the sense\nof life (1935a, IV.5).\n\nOn several occasions, especially in (1927) and (1939a), Fleck uses the\nterm \u201cincommensurability\u201d\n(niewsp\u00f3\u0142mierno\u015b\u0107) of concepts or\nideas. He does not develop this issue. Yet it is easy\u2014by looking\nthrough the Kuhnian glasses\u2014to extract from his writings a quite\nwell developed theory of incommensurability of thought styles. Its\ncore is constituted by the claim that in the historical development of\nscience there are no invariants.\n\n(a) The language used to describe what to members of a collective\nappears as reality changes. Some words disappear, other appear, and\neven if words remain their meanings change to a greater or lesser\nextent. Fleck quotes some fragments of writings of a physicist James\nClerk Maxwell and a philosopher Henri Bergson on motion and knowledge\non motion and he concludes that the words \u201cmotion\u201d and\n\u201cknowledge\u201d have different meanings for them: \u201cit is\nnot as if the word of one of them meant a thing that the other would\ngive a different name, but that a thing to which one of them gave a\ncertain name does not exist at all for the other one\u201d (1936,\nII). We can find similar examples in writings of\n\u201cscientists\u201d. Heat in the second half of the 18th century\nwas on the list of chemical elements, and in the 19th century it\nbecame the motion of atoms. What Lavoisier or Carnot called\n\u201cheat\u201d, for Maxwell or Boltzmann did not exist and\nvice versa. So if they could meet and talk they would not\nmake inconsistent claims about the same phenomenon, but would speak of\nsomething different. \u201cIt is not possible to express with\ntoday\u2019s words the content of a view of a distant epoch since\nparticular notions of this epoch are incommensurable with the ones of\ntoday\u201d (1939a).\n\nObviously, it is not possible to explain to somebody outside of our\nthought collective the meanings of the concepts we use through verbal\ndefinitions, for we define words by other words which she does not\nunderstand to the same degree as she does not understand the defined\nword. It is not possible to define a word ostensively, for that person\ndoes not perceive in the world those objects which we perceive as\nbelonging to the scope of the term defined. The only thing we can do\nis to teach her the basis of our thought style, like we teach our\nchildren and the young. The first step sometimes consists in creating\na platform of partial understanding with a member of other collective\nfor the price of impoverishing content and some deformations. But this\nis not argumentation but propaganda (1936, III).\n\n(b) After passing from one thought style to another within \u201cthe\nsame\u201d scientific discipline, research problems change. Losses\nappear along with benefits. For example, when the contemporary concept\nof syphilis was created one learned very much, but many details of\nearlier theories were also lost. Earlier researchers did not know many\nof the details that we know, but knew more about what according to\nthem had a greater value. Later researchers see many problems which\ntheir predecessors treated as unimportant or senseless. \u201cThis\ncreates specialized valuation and characteristic intolerance, which\nare features shared by all exclusive communities\u201d (1935a, IV.3).\nThis valuation becomes stronger, for after passing from one thought\nstyle to another the research methods and standards for evaluating\nresearch results change to a greater or lesser extent.\n\n(c) Previous researchers\u2014looking from the same point to the same\ndirection\u2014did not see what we see, but they saw something we are\nnot able to see. Those people thought and saw differently than we do\n(1935a, IV.5). Their physical reality does not exist for us, and our\nphysical reality did not exist for them.\n\nThis all leads to an extremely anti-realistic standpoint. The thought\nstyle creates reality. Nowadays science is not closer to any objective\npicture of the world than the science of 100 years ago (1946). The\nonly difference is that there are now many more scientists than ever\nand as a result our picture of the world is richer in details than any\nprior picture. However, the fact that a certain view seems for us to\nbe true is only a sign of our education and not that of the\ncorrespondence to \u201can independently existing reality\u201d\n(1938). What members of a collective call truth, from the point of\nview of sociology of cognition is the up-to-date stage of changes of\nthought-style (1936, VI) or stylized thought constraint (1935a,\nIV.3).\n\nSince in the historical development of science there is no constant,\nunchanging part, since scientific knowledge changes continuously as a\nwhole, then science does not contain any objective picture of the\nworld, and it does not even contain any part of such a picture (1946).\nYet contrary to Kuhn, Fleck does not avoid using the term\n\u201ctruth\u201d in reference to scientific statements. And he\nemphasizes that truth is neither subjective nor relative:\n\nIt is always, or almost always, completely determined within a thought\nstyle. One can never say that the same thought is true for A and false\nfor B. If A and B belong to the same thought collective, the thought\nwill be either true or false for both. But if they belong to different\nthought collectives, it will just not be the same thought (1935a,\nIV.3).\n\n9. Reception\n\nBefore World War II there appeared nineteen reviews of Fleck\u2019s\nbook on the genesis and development of a scientific fact, most of them\npositive; yet only one was published in a philosophical journal, and\nthe rest were published in medical or popular journals and newspapers.\nAfter WWII Fleck\u2019s epistemology, in spite of all his efforts,\nwas completely forgotten. Thomas S. Kuhn mentioned his book in the\nPreface to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions as\n\u201can essay that anticipated many of my own ideas\u201d (Kuhn\n1962, p. VII); but for at least fifteen years during fierce debates\nprovoked by Kuhn\u2019s book, nobody paid attention to this remark.\nIt was only a paper by Wilhelm Baldamus (1977) and a book by his\nstudent Thomas Schnelle (1982) that awakened a broader interest in\nFleck\u2019s philosophy and sociology of science. Fleck\u2019s book\nwas republished in the German language in 1980. In 1979 its English\ntranslation Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact\nappeared; and between 1986 and 1990 most of Fleck\u2019s\nepistemological papers became available in English. Fleck\u2019s book\nand articles was translated into Italian, Polish, Spain, Swedish,\nRussian, Ukrainian, Korean, French and Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nToday, in the English speaking world, Fleck is mostly considered to be\nan unappreciated forerunner of Thomas Kuhn\u2019s theory of\nscientific revolutions. It is in the German speaking community of\nphilosophers and sociologists of science that Fleck is considered to\nbe a highly original epistemologist, who presents human knowledge in a\nquite peculiar and explorative way which significantly transcends\nKuhn\u2019s theses. In France there is a group of philosophers and\nhistorians of medicine\u2014Ilana L\u00f6wy and others\u2014who\napply Fleck\u2019s ideas in their research. In his famous\nintroduction to the actor-network theory, Bruno Latour named Fleck\n\u201cthe founder of sociology of science\u201d (Latour 2005, p.\n112). In 2005 Ludwik Fleck Zentrum was founded in Collegium\nHelveticum, Z\u00fcrich, led by Johannes Fehr until 2014; since 2015\nthe centre is managed by Hartmut von Sass. In Brazil Ludwik Fleck has\ninfluenced at least three different \u201cthought collectives\u201d:\nhis theory is applied by historians of science, in teaching and\nlearning science, and in philosophy (Cond\u00e9 2016). There is a\ngroup of Serbian archaeologists who are inspired in their work by\nFleck\u2019s epistemology (Milosavljevi\u0107 2016).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature: Fleck\u2019s Epistemological Writings", "Translations", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature: Fleck\u2019s Epistemological Writings": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1927, \u201cO niekt\u00f3rych swoistych cechach my\u015blenia\nlekarskiego\u201d, <em>Archiwum Historii i Filozofii Medycyny oraz\nHistorii Nauk Przyrodniczych</em>, 6: 55\u201364.
