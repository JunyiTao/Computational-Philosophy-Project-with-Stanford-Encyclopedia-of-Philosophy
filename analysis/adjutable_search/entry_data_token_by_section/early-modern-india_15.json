For\nexample, \u2018if there is no fire, then there is no smoke\u2019(TS\n73).\n\n\nThe terms in this definition require explanation. The technical sense\nof \u2018ascription\u2019 (\u0101ropa) is\n\u2018counterfactual or suppositional cognition\u2019\n(\u0101h\u0101ry\u0101ropa), defined as a cognition whose\nqualifier is an property the opposite of which is known to reside in\nthe qualificand. In other words, it is a counterfactual assumption.\n\u2018Pervader\u2019 and \u2018pervaded\u2019 are notions taken\nfrom the Ny\u0101ya theory of inference. When we say that wherever\nthere is smoke, there is fire, this can be re-expressed as that fire\npervades smoke, i.e. that the property of being a\nsmoke-possessing-thing has a narrower extension than the property of\nbeing a fire-possessing-thing. So here, fire is the pervader and smoke\nis the pervaded. Thus, tarka consists in a cognition of\nsmoke\u2019s absence given the counterfactual assumption that fire is\nabsent. It is the cognition of a conditional \u201cif p then\nq\u201d, or \u201cwere p to be true then\nq would be true\u201d, assuming that\n\u2018p\u2019 is false.\n\nOne main function of tarka is said to be the elimination of\ndoubt. Suppose one has the doubt \u201cIs x\nF?\u201d. One might then judge \u201cif x is not\nF then x is not G\u201d, and if one also\nknows that x is G, it will follow that x is\nF. The Naiy\u0101yikas recognise this function but deny\nnevertheless that tarka is a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a). Their reason, it seems, is that there\nis a distinction between citing positive empirical evidence for a\nthesis and merely eliminating the contrary possibility by a priori\nmethods. This is reflected, perhaps, in the fact that no example is\ncited in arguments based on tarka to buttress the inference.\nThe Manual of Reason, it seems, goes even further and denies\nthat the counterfactual conditional is a true cognition, which\nimplies, since they are not false either, that counterfactual\nconditionals do not have a truth-value.\n\nUdayana claims that tarka is of five types, namely\n\u2018self-dependence\u2019 (\u0101tm\u0101\u015braya),\n\u2018mutual dependence\u2019 (anyony\u0101\u015braya),\n\u2018circle\u2019 (cakraka), \u2018infinite\nregress\u2019 (anavasth\u0101), and \u2018having an\nundesirable consequence\u2019 or reductio-ad-absurdum\n(ani\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101prasa\u1e45ga). These are basically\nself-explanatory \u2013 the fifth,\n\u2018prasa\u1e45ga\u2019 is the one used to great effect\nby N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and other M\u0101dhyamika Buddhists. Other\nauthors give slightly different lists (see S. Bagchi 1953 for\ndetails).\n",
