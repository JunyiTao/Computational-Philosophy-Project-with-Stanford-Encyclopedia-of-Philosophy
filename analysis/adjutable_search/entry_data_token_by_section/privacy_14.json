    "main_text": "Contemporary Debates || The Cultural Relativity of the Value of Privacy\n4.3 The Cultural Relativity of the Value of Privacy\n Schoeman (1984b) has pointed out that the question of whether or\nnot privacy is culturally relative can be interpreted in different\nways. One question is whether privacy is deemed valuable to all\npeoples, or whether its value is relative and subject to cultural\ndifferences (see Westin 1967; Rachels 1975; Allen 1988; A. Moore\n2003). Another question is whether there are any aspects of life that\nare inherently private and not just conventionally so. There is also\nsome literature on the different cultures of privacy in different\nregions of the world. A growing number of articles are concerned with\nprivacy conceptions in China, not only due to technological\ndevelopments over the last years (as detailed in Ma 2019 for a\nrelational, Western-Eastern conception of privacy; H. Roberts 2022),\nbut also on earlier periods in Chinese culture, for instance on\nConfucian and Taoist thinking (Whitman 1985; for attitudes towards\nhealthcare, see Chen et al. 2007). Basu (2012) writes about the Indian\nperception of privacy, based on India\u2019s cultural values, and\noffers an explanation for why their concept of privacy seems to extend\nbeyond the often-dominating public-private dichotomy. Capurro (2005)\ndeals with intercultural aspects of privacy, particularly with regard\nto differences between Japanese and Western conceptions (see also\nNakada & Tamura 2005). For a perspective on the general Buddhist\ntheory of privacy, see Hongladarom (2016). The ubuntu perspective on\nprivacy is discussed by Reviglio and Alunge (2020).\n",
