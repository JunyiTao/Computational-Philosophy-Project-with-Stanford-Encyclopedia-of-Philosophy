    "main_text": "Making sense of text || Making connections\n5.2  Making connections\nText and spoken language do not consist of isolated sentences, but\nof connected, interrelated utterances, forming a coherent\nwhole\u2014typically, a temporally and causally structured narrative,\na systematic description or explanation, a sequence of instructions,\nor a structured argument for a conclusion (or in dialogue, as\ndiscussed later, question-answer exchanges, requests followed by\nacknowledgments, mixed-initiative planning, etc.).\n\nThis structure is already apparent at the level of pairs of consecutive\nclauses, such as\n\n(5.12)  John looked out at the sky. It was dark\nwith\nthunderclouds.\n(5.13)  John looked out at the sky, and decided to\ntake along\nhis umbrella.\n\n\n\nIn (5.12), we understand that John's looking at the sky temporally\noverlaps the presence of the dark clouds in the sky (i.e., the\ndark-cloud situation at least contains the end of the looking event).\nAt a deeper level, we also understand that John perceived the\nsky to be dark with thunderclouds, and naturally assume that John took\nthe clouds to be harbingers of an impending storm, as we\nourselves would. In (5.13), the two clauses appear to\nreport successive events and furthermore, the first event is\nunderstood to have led causally to the second\u2014John's decision\nwas driven by whatever he saw upon looking at the sky; and based on\nour knowledge of weather and the function of umbrellas, and the fact\nthat \u201ceveryone\u201d possesses that knowledge, we further infer\nthat John perceived potential rainclouds, and intended to fend off any\nrain with his umbrella in an imminent excursion.\nThe examples show that interpreting extended  multi-clausal\ndiscourses depends on both narrative conventions and world knowledge;\n(similarly for descriptive, instructional or argumentative text) . In\nparticular, an action sentence followed by a static observation, as in\n(5.12), typically suggests the kind of action-situation overlap we\nnoted, and successively reported actions or events, as in (5.13),\ntypically suggest temporal sequencing and perhaps a causal connection,\nespecially if one of the two clauses is not a volitional action. These\nsuggestive inferences presumably reflect the narrator's adherence to a\nGricean principle of orderliness, though such an observation is little\nhelp from a computational perspective. The concrete task is to\nformulate coherence principles for narrative and other forms of\ndiscourses and to elucidate, in a usable form, the particular\nsyntactico-semantic properties at various levels of granularity that\ncontribute to coherence.\nThus various types of rhetorical or coherence relations (between\nclauses or larger discourse segments) have been proposed in the\nliterature, e.g., by Hobbs (1979), Grosz & Sidner (1986), and Mann\n& Thompson (1988). Proposed coherence relations are ones like\nelaboration, exemplification, parallelism, and contrast. We defer\nfurther discussion of rhetorical structure\nto section 6 (on language generation).\n",
