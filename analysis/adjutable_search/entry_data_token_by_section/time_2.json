    "main_text": "The Topology of Time\n3. The Topology of Time\n\nIt\u2019s natural to think that time can be represented by a line.\nBut a line has a shape. What shape should we give to the line that\nrepresents time? This is a question about the topology, or structure,\nof time.\n\nOne natural way to answer our question is to say that time should be\nrepresented by a single, straight, non-branching, continuous line that\nextends without end in each of its two directions. This is the\n\u201cstandard topology\u201d for time. But for each of the features\nattributed to time in the standard topology, two interesting questions\narise: (a) does time in fact have that feature? and (b) if time does\nhave the feature in question, is this a necessary or a contingent fact\nabout time?\n\nQuestions about the topology of time appear to be closely connected to\nthe issue of Platonism versus relationism with respect to time. For if\nrelationism is true, then it seems likely that time\u2019s\ntopological features will depend on contingent facts about the\nrelations among things and events in the world, whereas if Platonism\nis true, so that time exists independently of whatever is in time,\nthen time will presumably have its topological properties as a matter\nof necessity. But even if we assume that Platonism is true, it\u2019s\nnot clear exactly what topological properties should be attributed to\ntime.\n\nConsider the question of whether time should be represented by a line\nwithout a beginning (so a line, rather than a line segment). Aristotle\nhas argued (roughly) that time cannot have a beginning on the grounds\nthat in order for time to have a beginning, there must be a first\nmoment of time, but that in order to count as a moment of time, that\nallegedly first moment would have to come between an earlier period of\ntime and a later period of time, which is inconsistent with its being\nthe first moment of time. (Aristotle argues in the same way that time\ncannot have an end.)\n\nAristotle\u2019s argument may or may not be a good one, but even if\nit is unsound, many people will feel, purely on intuitive grounds,\nthat the idea of time having a beginning (or an end) just does not\nmake sense. And here we have an excellent illustration of what is at\nstake in the controversy over whether time has its topological\nproperties as a contingent matter or as a matter of necessity. For\nsuppose we come to have excellent evidence that the universe itself\nhad a beginning in time. (This seems like the kind of thing that could\nbe supported by empirical evidence in cosmology.) This would still\nleave open the question of whether the beginning of the universe\noccurred after an infinitely long period of \u201cempty\u201d time,\nor, instead, coincided with the beginning of time itself. There are\ninteresting and plausible arguments for each of these positions.\n\nIt is also worth asking whether time must be represented by a single\nline. Perhaps we should take seriously the possibility of time\u2019s\nconsisting of multiple time streams, each one of which is isolated\nfrom each other, so that every moment of time stands in temporal\nrelations to other moments in its own time stream, but does not bear\nany temporal relations to any moment from another time stream.\nLikewise we can ask whether time could correspond to a branching line\n(perhaps to allow for the possibility of time travel or to model an\nopen future), or to a closed loop, or to a discontinuous line. And we\ncan also wonder whether one of the two directions of time is in some\nway privileged, in a way that makes time itself asymmetrical. (We say\nmore about this last option in particular in the section on time and\nphysics.)\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: (1) On the beginning\nand end of time: Aristotle, Physics, Bk.
