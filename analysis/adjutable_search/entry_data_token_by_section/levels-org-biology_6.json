Reductionism, pluralism, and levels\n\nAs we saw above, Oppenheim and Putnam introduced their highly\ninfluential view of levels in the context of the reductive unity of\nscience, and Wimsatt\u2019s account was partly motivated by the need\nto respond to reductionism. Up to this day, levels have continued to\nplay an important role in debates on reductionism (see the entry\n Reductionism in Biology).\n Questions of reductionism are often explicitly formulated in terms of\nlevels: Do higher level properties, theories, or explanations reduce\nto lower level ones?\n\nIn the classical Nagelian account (Nagel 1961), reduction amounts to\nderiving a theory that is to be reduced from a more fundamental theory\non the basis of two conditions: deducibility and connectability (see\nthe entry\n Scientific Reduction).\n The standard example is the reduction of thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics. Nagel thought that from the laws of statistical\nmechanics one an derive the laws of thermodynamics (deducibility),\nwith the help of \u201cbridge principles\u201d that connect the\nterms of these two theories (connectability; Nagel 1961: ch. 11;\nSchaffner 1967).\n\nNagel\u2019s original approach to reduction has been criticized from\nmany angles, but in the present context, the most relevant criticism\nis that the classical model ignores the distinction between\ninterlevel and intralevel reductions in science\n(Wimsatt 1976a; 1976b; McCauley 1996). Intralevel (or successional)\nsettings involve competing theories within a particular science and\nwithin a particular level, for example the phlogiston theory and the\ncaloric theory of heat. Interlevel settings, on the other hand,\ninvolve theories at different levels of organization that thereby have\ndiffering explananda, terminology and methodology: for example,\ncognitive psychology and molecular neuroscience. Nagel\u2019s model\nin its classic form treats these different contexts equally. For this\nand many other reasons (see, e.g., Walter & Eronen 2011), it is\nwidely agreed that the Nagelian model fails to reconstruct reductive\nrelations as they appear in actual science (Wimsatt 1976b; 1979), and\nthat the model in its original form is inapplicable to actual\nbiological cases (Kaiser 2012).\n\nProblems of the Nagelian model led to the development of alternative\naccounts based on the same basic idea, which actively incorporated the\nidea of levels into their framework (Hooker 1981; P.S. Churchland\n1986; Schaffner 1993; Bickle 1998; 2003). This culminated in the\n\u201cNew Wave\u201d model of reduction, where intertheoretic\nrelations form a continuum ranging from complete elimination to\nretentive Nagel-style reduction (Bickle 1998). For a summary of this\nmodel, see the entry\n Scientific Reduction\n \u00a72.6.\n\nOther accounts of reduction also countenance the levels concept,\nalbeit in different ways. In his \u201cruthless\u201d account of\nreductionism, Bickle (2003) abandons the idea of reduction progressing\nstepwise from level to level, and argues that cellular and molecular\nneuroscience can directly replace psychology (see also Barwich 2021).\nIf one can intervene onto the molecular level to change variables at\nthe behavioral level, then, Bickle contends, one has discovered the\n\u201cgenuine\u201d causal mechanism for those variables (Bickle\n2003). Here \u2018levels\u2019 figure into ruthless reductionism as\nuseful fictions, where intermediary levels such as tissues, organs,\nand the like provide a scaffolding for emerging molecular-level\nexplanations. These intermediary levels exhibit \u201cmerely\u201d\nheuristic value, only in the service of constructing\nbehavior-to-molecules reductions (Bickle 2003: 130). Recently, Bickle\nhas defended an even stronger and explicitly \u201clevels-less\u201d\nversion of reductionism, where levels no longer have even a heuristic\nrole (Bickle et al., 2022).\n\nA different reconceptualization of reduction is offered by\nH\u00fcttemann and Love (2011), who note that part-whole reduction in\nparticular has become a widely-endorsed alternative to the Nagelian\nframework (see also Brigandt 2013: 77). They put forward\ncompositionality and causality as two aspects of\nreductive explanation (H\u00fcttemann & Love 2011: 4), which are\nboth expressed in levels-laden language. Compositionality, for\ninstance, is couched in \u2018levels\u2019 in that the very notions\nof part and whole in biological contexts correspond to respectively\nlower- and higher-level status (cf. Kaiser 2015, 192; Winther 2006).\nKaiser (2015) goes further than this approach in claiming that a\n\u201clower-level character\u201d is a necessary condition for an\nexplanation to even be considered reductive (2015: 188).\n\nThe idea of levels has also figured prominently into arguments for\nantireductionism and pluralism. In his classic treatise, Philip\nKitcher (1984) elevates the level concept to a centerpiece of the\nantireductionist position. According to Kitcher, the reductionist\naspiration of reducing classical Mendelian to molecular genetics will\nnot pan out because molecular constituents do not capture the causal\nrelations between Mendelian constituents (e.g., chromosomes) and\nheritable traits. Importantly, Kitcher grounds this in the structure\nof the world as captured by the levels concept:\n\n\nAnti-reductionism construes the current division of biology not simply\nas a temporary feature of our science stemming from our cognitive\nimperfections but as the reflection of levels of organization in\nnature. (1984: 371, emphasis modified; Rosenberg [1985: 119]\nmakes a similar statement)\n\n\nElevating the levels concept even further, Kitcher makes levels (of\nthe layer-cake variety) part of the conception of antireductionism\nitself, concluding that\n\n\nto the extent that we can make sense of the present explanatory\nstructure within biology\u2014that division of the field into\nsubfields corresponding to levels of organization in nature\u2014we\ncan also understand the antireductionist doctrine. (Kitcher 1984:\n373)\n\n\nIn a more recent defense of antireductionism, Robert McCauley (1996;\n2007) expands on the intra-interlevel distinction to plead for a\nmultilevel explanatory pluralism between higher- and lower-level\ntheories. McCauley targets the New Wave model where intertheory\nrelations result in a spectrum of consequences, ranging from identity\nto elimination, for higher-level theories (P.M. Churchland 1979; P.M.\nChurchland and P.S. Churchland 1990; Bickle 1998). He argues that a\nsingle spectrum of reductive consequences misrepresents the nature of\nintertheory coevolution. Intralevel reductions, focusing on reduction\nin terms of replacement, do not capture the historical dynamics\ninvolved in evaluating interlevel cases, and elimination is virtually\nnonexistent in interlevel cases. Moreover, eliminating or reducing\nhigher-level theories would also undermine the status of the\nhigher-level\u2019s scientific institutions (McCauley 1996). As this\nrarely happens, and attributing epistemic, ontological, or\nmethodological superiority to the lower levels is at best a claim that\nneeds to be substantiated, the New Wave model appears to be wildly at\nodds with actual scientific practice. According to McCauley, we\nobserve intertheoretical coevolution instead, where higher-level\ntheories can offer lower-level theories criteria for external\ncoherency, evidential constraints, and novel problem solving\nstrategies (McCauley 1996).\n\nOther arguments for pluralism also take their start from levels of\norganization. Sandra Mitchell (2003), for instance, argues for\nintegrative pluralism that is suggested by the multilevel and\nmulticomponential \u201contology of complex systems\u201d (2009:\n109). The basic idea of integrative pluralism falls out of the fact\nthat biological systems evolve in a contingent manner, thus setting\nthe stage for multilevel evolutionary scenarios (Mitchell 2003). This\nin turn highlights the preponderance of \u2018emergent\nproperties\u2019 in biological systems, which appear at novel levels\nof organization out of the interactions of simpler components. Both of\nthese factors inflate the overall number of explanatory sources that\ncould contribute to explaining a given phenomenon (2003; 2009).\nConsequently, discovering unilateral causes for complex phenomena will\nnot be forthcoming (2003, 160). Likewise, Ingo Brigandt (2010; 2013)\nemphasizes the pursuance of investigation at multiple levels of\norganization as a fact about scientific practice, but also as cause to\narticulate the localized significance of explanatory contributions to\nparticular problems, as in the case of evo-devo explanations.\n\nThis kind of multilevel pluralism is also defended by the supporters\nof the New Mechanism (Bechtel 2008; Craver 2005, 2007; Brigandt 2010:\n297; see also\n Mechanisms in Science).\n As McCauley (2007) points out, mechanistic explanation can be seen as\nexplanatory pluralism \u201cwrit small\u201d: In each localized\nmechanistic context, several levels (understood as levels of\nmechanisms) are needed to fully explain the phenomenon. However,\nauthors such as Fazekas (2022), Fazekas and Kert\u00e9sz (2011), and\nSoom (2012) argue that the commitments of New Mechanism are in fact\nincompatible with robust antireductionism.\n",
