    "main_text": "Christian August Crusius || Philosophy\n5.2 Philosophy\n\nWidely and rightly regarded as the most sophisticated philosopher\nwithin the Thomasian-Pietist tradition, Crusius sets out to offer an\nalternative to the core claims of the Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy\non topics in metaphysics, epistemology, logic and practical\nphilosophy. As Lange had previously, Crusius targets the principle of\nsufficient reason, and its employment in Leibnizian-Wolffian\nmetaphysics, for criticism. Crusius diagnoses a number of ambiguities\nin the Wolffian presentation of the principle. He opts to refer to a\nreason (ratio; Grund) that, when present, determines\nsomething to come to be such that the opposite would be impossible as\na determining reason, and accordingly refers to the principle\n(in the sense intended by Leibniz and Wolff) as the principle of\ndetermining reason (Crusius 1743: \u00a7II\u2013III). Crusius\nthen critically discusses each of Wolff\u2019s attempts to prove the\nprinciple\u2014concerning the first such proof (presented in\n \u00a73.1,\n above), Crusius claims that the most charitable reconstruction of it\nis circular. To show this, Crusius reformulates Wolff\u2019s proof as\nthe following syllogism (using Wolff\u2019s preferred\nterminology):\n\n\nWhatever cannot come to be except from some other cause, has a\nsufficient reason.\n\nEverything that is cannot come to be except from another cause.\n\nTherefore, whatever is has a sufficient reason. (Crusius 1743:\n\u00a7XI [2019: 207])\n\n\nAs Crusius notes, however, the minor in this case is just a version of\nthe principle of sufficient reason itself, so that as a proof of that\nprinciple this argument begs the question.\n\nMore positively, Crusius endorses the principle of determining reason\nbut denies that it admits of unlimited use, which he claims, echoing\nLange, would entail fatalism. Rather, Crusius excludes what he terms\n\u201cfree first [or fundamental] actions\u201d from the\nscope of the principle. These actions are such that they proceed\ndirectly from the basic powers of the acting substance under\nappropriate circumstances (Crusius 1745: \u00a782), but are such that\nthey can be undertaken or omitted by the acting subject (that is, they\nare not determined) (Crusius 1743: \u00a7XXV). That such\nactions are possible, Crusius claims, is clear given that God\u2019s\naction would be of this sort, but also given the testimony of our own\ninner experience, which discloses the acts of our own will to be just\nsuch actions (Crusius 1743: \u00a7IX). Crusius thus accepts that the\nprinciple of determining reason holds for all events that are\nnot the result of a free first action, whereas free first\nactions no doubt have a cause but are not such that could not have\noccurred otherwise (or not at all).\n\nAlong with his efforts to secure a place for genuine freedom of the\nwill in his metaphysics, Crusius also emphasizes the limits of the\nhuman understanding. Crusius claims that the acts of the understanding\nare governed by principles, including a formal principle (the\nprinciple of contradiction), but also and importantly a number of\n\u201cmaterial\u201d principles that govern what is thinkable for\nthe human mind (where what is unthinkable is not for that reason\ncontradictory). Among these principles are the principle of\ninseparability, according to which that which cannot be separated\nin thought cannot be separated in fact, and the priniciple of\nincombinability, according to which that which cannot be combined\nin thought cannot in fact be combined (Crusius 1743: \u00a7XXVII;\n1745: \u00a715). Significantly, and drawing on Thomasius (via Hoffmann\n1737), Crusius contends that these principles which together\nconstitute the \u201cessence of the understanding\u201d supply us\nwith a criterion of truth, which consists in the agreement of thoughts\nwith things, such that only that can be true which conforms to the\nprinciples of human understanding (Crusius 1745: \u00a715; 1747:\n\u00a751). These material principles are subsequently used by Crusius\nto vindicate a variety of substantive metaphysical claims, including\none he dubs the principle of sufficient cause (Crusius 1745:\n\u00a731). On this basis, Crusius erects his own distinctive\nmetaphysics, proceeding through the now-established Wolffian topics,\nthough Crusius assigns natural theology a place more befitting its\nimportance and ignores empirical psychology because it takes up\nspontaneous and free acts of the mind and so does not concern\nnecessary truths of reason, the only proper subject of\nmetaphysics.\n\nCrusius\u2019 attack on Wolffianism continues in his logic and his\nthoughts on moral philosophy. In a clear rebuke of Wolff, Crusius\nbegins his logic by rigidly distinguishing between the methods of\nmathematics and philosophy, contending that where the former makes use\nof demonstrations that rely solely on the principle of contradiction\n(and relate to mere possibilities or hypothetical realities), the\nlatter must take into account other principles when, for instance, the\ninvestigation of causes are at issue (Crusius 1747: \u00a710).\nCommensurate with this, Crusius\u2019 considerations of the\ntraditional topics of logic\u2014concepts, propositions, and\ninferences\u2014is thoroughly informed by his account of the essence\nof the understanding: a philosophical inference, as opposed to a\nmathematical syllogism, can have as its basis what permits of being\nseparated or combined in thought (Crusius 1747: \u00a7262). Crusius\nalso considers the relation between philosophy and theology or\nrevealed religion, contending for the utility of philosophy for\nstudents of theology but also arguing that religion provides a needed\ncorrective to the misuse of philosophy which, when left to its own\ndevices, tends to lay claim to the unrestricted use of its principles\n(such as PSR) whereas the appropriate restrictions are typically\nevident to the theologian (Crusius 1747: \u00a732).\n\nCrusius\u2019 ethics is characterized by the principled separation of\nthe will from the understanding as distinct powers, and a\nre-orientation of his moral theory with respect to the former. The\nhuman will depends on the understanding to supply it with ideas in\naccordance with which it acts, but Crusius is clear that the will is\nnot solely determined to its action through some cognition (i.e., of\nperfection) in the act itself; rather, the goodness of an action\nconsists more generally in its being conformable to the will (Crusius\n1745: \u00a726; Schneewind 1998: 447), and in any case the human will\nis always free to act or to omit to act in accordance with the\nunderstanding\u2019s ideas. The human will is possessed of three\nbasic desires\u2014the first is for our own perfection, in accordance\nwith which the talents of the intellect among others are promoted\n(Crusius 1745: \u00a7117); for unification with objects perceived as\nperfect, from which proceeds a drive to moral love through which we\ndesire to join with other rational beings without any further end\n(Crusius 1745: \u00a7125); and finally, the desire to recognize a\ndivine law which, despite its abstract-sounding name, is identified by\nCrusius with the phenomenon of conscience (Gewissenstrieb).\nIt is through conscience that we are able to recognize the divinely\ngiven moral law (Crusius 1745: \u00a7132), and conscience thereby also\ndiscloses our dependence on God as divine lawgiver (Crusius 1745:\n\u00a7165). As such, conscience supplies us with a motivation to\nobedience where, according to Crusius, this obedience constitutes an\nessential component (the \u201cform\u201d) of virtue (Crusius 1745:\n\u00a7177). A derivation of our duties thus depends on a consideration\nof God and His aim in creating the world, which Crusius identifies as\nall human beings\u2019 attainment of virtue, as opposed to\nknowledge or happiness in its own right, through their free actions\n(Crusius 1745: \u00a7213). On this basis, he proceeds to derive duties\nto God, to others, and to the self (for discussion, see Schneewind\n1998: 452\u20136).\n",
