(1) Many of\nthe world\u2019s religious traditions and spiritual writings are\nmarked by pantheistic ideas and feelings. This is particularly so for\nexample, in Hinduism of the Advaita Vedanta school, in some varieties\nof Kabbalistic Judaism, in Celtic spirituality, and in Sufi mysticism.\n(2) Another vital source of pantheistic ideas is to be found in\nliterature, for example, in such writers as Goethe, Coleridge,\nWordsworth, Emerson, Walt Whitman, D.H. Lawrence, and Robinson\nJeffers. Although it should be added that, far from being limited to\nhigh culture, pantheistic themes are familiar, too, in popular media,\nfor example in such films as Star Wars, Avatar, and The\nLion King. (3) Thirdly, as it is in this article, pantheism may\nbe considered philosophically; that is, a critical\nexamination may be made of its central ideas with respect to their\nmeaning, their coherence, and the case to be made for or against their\nacceptance.\n",
