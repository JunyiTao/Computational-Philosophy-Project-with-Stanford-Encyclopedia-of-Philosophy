Theory of Knowledge and Philosophy of Science\n\n\nOnce Regius had publicly established his independence vis-\u00e0-vis\nDescartes in 1647, he began to publish a theory of knowledge that\nreflected his medical interests (Bellis, 2013) and complemented the account of human\nnature that he adopted in opposition to his former mentor. The result\nwas an epistemology that was closer to that which appeared, almost\nfour decades later, in Locke\u2019s Essay than anything that he\nhad read in Descartes. This transition had begun while drafting\nFundamenta physices, in which Regius denied the need for any\ninnate ideas, including even the idea of God.\n\n\nThe mind, in order to think, does not seem to need innate ideas,\nimages, notions or axioms; rather, its innate faculty of thinking is\nsufficient on its own in order for it to complete all its thinking\nactivities. This is evident in the perception of pain, colour, taste,\nand other similar perceptions, which are genuinely perceived by the\nmind, although none of those ideas is innate. Nor is there any reason\nwhy some ideas rather than others should be innate by their very\nnature. (Regius 1646, 251)\n\n\nRegius supported this with the claim that a young person who had not\nbeen educated would, if asked, deny knowledge of things of which they\nhad no experience (1654, 251). Since an innate idea of God was central\nto the Cartesian project, Regius made his own position explicit by\nalso denying that the idea of God is innate: \u201cEven the idea of\nGod \u2026 does not seem to be innate in us, but is produced in us\ninitially by observing things or is passed on to us by others\u201d\n(Regius 1646, 252).\n\n\nRegius rejected the innateness of ideas for the same reason that\nDescartes had rejected various scholastic entities: it was redundant\nto an adequate explanation of thinking.\n\n\nIt is evident from the perception of titillation and of pain, of\nsounds and light, which arise from the motion of an objective body,\nthat the stimulation of the senses does not require intentional\nspecies, nor spiritual qualities, nor any other unintelligible things,\nbut that local motion alone and its variations suffice for this\npurpose. (Regius 1646, 253\u20134)\n\n\nHe repeated the denial of innate ideas in the Corollaries of 1647:\n\u201cThe mind does not need innate ideas, or notions, or axioms; its\nfaculty of thinking alone is enough for it to perform its own\nactions\u201d (Regius 1647b, Corollary 12). Descartes\u2019 reply, in\nthe Notae (Descartes 1648), conceded the validity of Regius\u2019\nclaim by accepting that their disagreement was merely verbal: \u201cI\nnever wrote or claimed that the mind needs innate ideas which are\nanything other than its faculty of thinking\u201d (AT VIII-2,\n357). Regius subsequently generalized his claim, in\nPhilosophia naturalis (1654: 335); apart from what\nis revealed in Scripture, he argued, all thoughts originate in sensory\nexperience.\n\n\nAll those [i.e., conscious acts], which do not originate in divine\nrevelation, are sensations or derive their origin from sensation. For\nwe cannot will, judge, or remember anything, nor imagine anything, nor\notherwise perceive anything, unless some idea of that thing had been\nimmediately or mediately produced in us by sensation, or subsequently\ntriggered and presented to the mind.\n\n\nThis unequivocally empiricist claim was compounded by the denial of\nany \u2018pure intellect.\u2019 Regius had never appealed to a\n\u2018pure understanding\u2019 as a source of ideas, and had often\nasserted the \u2018organic\u2019 connection between mind and\nbody. He had defined \u2018organic\u2019, in the first of his\nPhysiologia disputations (Bos 2002, 200), in contrast with\n\u2018inorganic\u2019 as almost a synonym for \u2018bodily\ndependent\u2019. Organic parts of the body, such as the nerves,\nveins, or muscles, required a certain physical conformation of the\nbody in order to perform an action. When applied to the mind,\ntherefore, the term \u2018organic\u2019 suggested that the mind\ncould perform mental operations only on condition that various bodily\nparts functioned appropriately at the same time.\n\n\nThese early hints, which were short of an outright denial of a pure\nunderstanding, were interpreted correctly by Descartes in 1647. Regius\nhad defined perception in his banned disputation as \u2018sensation,\nremembering and imagining\u2019 (Regius 1647b: Corollaries,\nno. 18), and Descartes concluded that he was implicitly denying the\nreality of pure understanding: \u201cOne could draw the conclusion\nthat he does not accept any pure understanding, that is, an\nunderstanding that is not concerned with physical images; and\ntherefore he thinks that we have no knowledge of God or the human\nsoul, or of other non-physical things\u201d (AT VIII-2, 363). Regius\nconfirmed that interpretation in his reply: \u201cThe human mind,\nalthough it is a substance that is really distinct from the body, is\nhowever organic in all its actions while it is in the body \u2026 it\ncannot perform any of its actions without bodily organs\u201d (Regius\n1648, 10).  Perhaps he had been applying Descartes\u2019 previous advice\nabout substantial forms\u2014to ignore them rather than deny their\nexistence explicitly\u2014when he refrained from denying a pure\nunderstanding in his earlier writings. By 1654, however, he was ready\nto publish an explicit denial: \u201cSince \u2026 we are able to\nexplain all its operations [i.e., those of the mind] by those\nfaculties of the intellect, which were already explained, there is no\nneed to add to them a pure intellect or anything similar as something\nthat is distinct from them\u201d (Regius 1654, 404). Nonetheless, the\ndenial of a pure intellect did not imply denying that human beings\nhave an idea of God; the latter is acquired in the same way as other\nideas, namely by using an intellect that is organically dependent on\nthe human body.\n\n\nSince all ideas originate in sensation, Regius had to acknowledge that\nwe often come to have ideas that originate from imagined realities and\nthat, in the case of veridical and non-veridical perceptions, the\nsubjective experiences are often sufficiently similar that one cannot\nbe certain of a correspondence between ideas and reality. In contrast\nwith the Cartesian rational defence of the reliability of our\ncognitive faculties, Regius claimed that one must rely on Scripture\nfor this purpose (Regius 1646, 249). However, Scripture does not\nguarantee that our perceptions are always certain. This issue was\nparticularly acute when the realities in question were unobservable\n(Regius 1646, 4).  Regius thought it was obvious that physical bodies\nare composed of insensible particles, and that their description is a\nmatter of hypothesis. When faced with the task of explanation,\ntherefore, he took refuge in some of the central themes of Cartesian\nnatural philosophy. He borrowed the \u2018fable\u2019 used by\nDescartes in Le Monde, that the natural world is composed of\none matter, that it is divided into parts of various sizes and shapes\nin motion, and that all natural phenomena may be explained by the laws\nof nature that apply to those parts (Regius 1646, 4).\n\n\nThis is the positive side of Regius\u2019 account of explanation.  The\nnegative side, as with Descartes, is a rejection of forms and\nqualities as understood by scholastic philosophers. For example,\nRegius had argued in 1641 that one does not explain how the heart\nworks by introducing a \u2018sentient and vegetative soul.\u2019 He\ncommented: \u201cThat is saying nothing more than this: that the\nheart is moved by whatever is the principle by which we live, sense\nand move (for that is how the soul is defined), which begs the\nquestion as to what that is\u201d (Regius 1641b, Disputatio VI,\nCorollary, par. V). Such an explanation of the heart\u2019s motion is\nsimilar to explaining the motion of a clock by \u2018a faculty of a\ncertain kind.\u2019 Regius proposed instead that we think of the\nworld as a great machine, and that we explain natural phenomena by\nhypothesizing how that machine works.\n\n\nThe world, therefore, is a great machine and each of its parts is a\nsmall machine, in which it can be observed and easily demonstrated\nthat there is nothing other than motion or rest, together with size,\nposition, and shape (I wish to make a unique exception of our soul).\nHowever, I regard the forms which are said to be substantial and\nlikewise qualities of a corporeal substance, whether occult or\nmanifest \u2026 as mere non-entities, which conceal our ignorance of\ncauses. (Regius 1641b, para. ix)\n\n\nIt follows from this kind of speculative reasoning about the\nunobservable inner structure of natural phenomena that scientific\nknowledge is only more or less probable. If we imagine a likely cause\nof some phenomenon as a configuration of unobservable particles and,\ndespite further research, cannot discover another possible cause that\nis either as likely or more likely, we should rest content with the\nfirst hypothesis until something better is discovered.\n\n\nWhen any question in physics is proposed for resolution, one should\nfirst think of an intelligible cause by which the effect that is\nobserved in the proposed problem could be explained intelligibly and\nappropriately. One should then look to see if a more appropriate or\nequally appropriate cause can be found. If a more appropriate cause is\nfound, it should be preferred. If one that is equally appropriate is\nfound, it should be treated as equally confirmed. However, if none is\nfound that is equally or more appropriate, the solution found should\nbe adopted until a better or equally good one is found. (Regius 1654,\nEpilogue)\n\n\nThe acceptance of probable hypotheses as the best available was a\nsignificant revision of a model of human knowledge, originally derived\nfrom Aristotle, according to which genuine knowledge must achieve the\ndegree of certainty that is provided by intuition and demonstration\n(Clarke 2011).  While other natural philosophers, even at the\nconclusion of the seventeenth century, refused to classify\nexplanations of natural phenomena as knowledge, because they were\nuncertain, Regius had accepted in mid-century that such uncertainty is\ninevitable except in the case of divine revelation. \u201cAlthough,\napart from divine revelation, there is no apodictic certainty about\nthings that exist outside our mind, but only moral or probable and\nlikely certainty, that is still sufficient to perform adequately and\nto control all the activities of human life, since nothing more is\nrequired for them apart from moral or probable truth or the certainty\nand likelihood of knowledge\u201d (Regius 1654, 351).\n",
