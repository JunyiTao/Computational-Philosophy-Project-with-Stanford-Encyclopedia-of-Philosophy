    "main_text": "Political style: some parliamentary applications\n5. Political style: some parliamentary applications\n\n\nBurke\u2019s life was spent in parliamentary affairs from the mid-1760s,\nand this made a difference to his style of intellectual activity. This\ndid not lie primarily in developing the cast of his mind, and if in\n1771 Burke stated that \u2018I have endeavoured all my life to train\nmy understanding and my temper in the studies and habits of\nPhilosophy\u2019, at the same time he concluded that \u2018my\nPrinciples are all settled and arranged\u2019\n .[5]\n This did not preclude intellectual innovation. The difference made by\nparticipation lay not least in his reasons for applying his mind, and\nconsequently in how he did so. The reasons were to influence opinion,\nboth in Parliament and from his position as a member of the\nlegislative, and to determine votes in the House of Commons itself. The\nmatter common to both of these was Burke\u2019s view that words were central\nto political understanding.\n\n\nAn obvious inference from Burke\u2019s account of compound abstract words\nis that to use these is to touch the experience of reader or listener,\nand that persuasion was unavoidably central to discussing politics:\nthis befitted a practical rather than a speculative subject. Indeed,\nthese terms implied that the point of discussing politics must be to\ninfluence action, and nothing much else. Burke developed great skill in\nmanaging words, begun in debating at Trinity and carried forward\nat other venues, including the House of Commons. As such language\nwas persuasive, its objective was to establish pro-attitudes and\ncon-attitudes in mind of listener or reader.\n\n\nThis was not the only philosophical aspect in Burke\u2019s political\npractice. A major conceptual tool in discussing politics was\nrelation. Relation is one of those terms which was common to both the\nscholastics and Locke. It denotes both comparison and connexion.\nComparison was an invaluable procedure because it enabled events,\ninstitutions and persons to be placed in any number of lights which\nwould raise or lower their significance and standing. Connexion was\nscarcely less valuable, because the place that someone or something\noccupied could be used to sustain or criticise their role, as well as\nto demonstrate the value of co-operative contraries. Best of all,\nrelation in either sense lent itself to a myriad of uses, for as\nLeClerc had remarked in his Logic (which Burke had read at\nTrinity) relations were beyond counting\u2014sunt autem\ninnumerae relationes (Le Clerc 1692, pt. 1, ch. 4, s. 1, p.\n19).\n\n\nBurke\u2019s conception of philosophical history was also fundamental to\nhis political practice. \u2018Every age has its own manners and its\npoliticks dependent upon them\u2019 (TCD, W & S, 1981\u20132015, ii 258.) The\nmanners Burke saw around him in England were continuous with those he\nhad seen in the middle ages, or projected backwards thither, in which a\npowerful executive government was balanced by other agencies with the\neffect of securing civil liberty. Those agencies most obvious in\nBurke\u2019s time had established the sovereignty of Parliament at the\nGlorious Revolution (1688\u20139), implied it in the Bill of Rights\n(1689), exercised it in the Act of Settlement (1701), and confirmed it by\nsuppressing the attempts made from 1708 to 1746 to reassert the\nsovereignty of kings alone. Burke understood law in this arrangement as\nthe guarantor of interests of the governed because it was law passed\nand secured by Parliament. It was secured in Parliament by the mutual\ndependence of Commons, Lords and King. That sovereignty had this public\ncharacter made the British state a beneficiary of a very high degree of\nfinancial credit, and this increased the power of Parliament. The long,\nslow movement of British history from a conception of the realm\nunderstood as royal property to the state conceived as the expression\nof public will had in Burke\u2019s time reached a stage at which this will\nwas expressed through the decisions of Parliament in a manner heavily\ninfluenced by the monarch. Burke\u2019s political activities therefore\nassumed parliamentary sovereignty.\n\n\nIf Burke\u2019s view of words and relations gave him practical\ntools, and if parliamentary sovereignty provided him with a practical\npostulate, what did he assume was the proper end of sovereignty? We\nhave seen that the relation between sovereign and the governed had for\na primary purpose the protection of the latter\u2019s civil interests. This\nmuch suggests continuity between Burke the philosopher/historian and\nBurke the political participant. But the former might also see that\nthere were complications for the latter. One who sees the multiplicity\nof civil interests, and the variety of relations in which they can be\nconsidered, and the variety of contraries at work, will see that to put\nsociety at ease with itself may well imply conflict and see that such\nconflict is hard to avoid; he or she will see, too, that Parliament\nforms an arena for conducting it in a stylised and moderated way\nthrough the representation of interests, appropriate to a civilized\nstate of society; and, even while participating in such a conflict,\ns/he might recognizes the necessity of both sides to the result. Here,\nopponents may be not only enemies but also co-workers, sharing at least\nsome common assumptions about the system within which their lot was\ncast, although separated from others by the role required of them. In\nthat situation, the question becomes, where do you take your place? The\nanswer may depend on your own connexions, and on how you\nconceive them.\n",
