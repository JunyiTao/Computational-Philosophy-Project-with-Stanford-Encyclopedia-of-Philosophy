    "main_text": "Boethius and the Latin Tradition\n7. Conclusion\n\nThere is no philosophy of the commentators in the sense of a definite\nset of doctrines that all the ancient commentators on Aristotle\nshared. What the ancient commentators shared was the practice of\nreading and commenting on the texts of Aristotle on the crucial\nassumption that Aristotle was a philosophical authority and his\nwritings deserved to be studied with great care.\n\nDue to the almost complete loss of the relevant literature, we know\nvery little about the first generation of interpreters of Aristotle.\nNo picture of unity emerges from the little that has reached us. The\nnotion that all these interpreters wrote commentaries is not supported\nby the information in our possession. The commentary eventually became\nthe standard form of exegesis. But even within the commentary\ntradition there was room for a plurality of exegetical positions.\nDifferent commentators developed different lines of interpretations in\nthe light of the different (often competing) concerns that motivated\ntheir exegesis. The exegetical tradition that finds its culmination in\nAlexander of Aphrodisias was primarily (but not exclusively) motivated\nby an attempt to defend the philosophy of Aristotle in the context of\nthe ancient debate between philosophical schools. Alexander of\nAphrodisias viewed Aristotle as his master and devoted his exegetical\nworks to explicate and extract Aristotle\u2019s distinctive\nphilosophical position. While the Platonists of Late Antiquity put\nthemselves in continuity with this tradition, their exegesis was\nlargely an attempt to develop a philosophy that insisted on the\ncontinuity between Plato and Aristotle. They wrote their commentaries\non the assumption that Aristotle and Plato were in substantial\nagreement.\n",
