    "main_text": "Detecting Ambiguity\n4. Detecting Ambiguity\n\nNow that we have separated types of ambiguity, we may reasonably ask\nhow we tell when a term or phrase contains an ambiguity. The answer\nmay be disappointing \u2013 there are tests and considerations but no\nfirm answers and probably a lot depends on what the \u2018best\ntheories\u2019 in linguistics etc. end up looking like. Nevertheless,\nwe can make some progress. The canonical source for these tests is\nZwicky and Sadock\u2019s \u2018Ambiguity Tests and How to Fail\nThem\u2019 (1975).\n\nThese tests generally depend on the presence or lack of\ninterpretations and on judgments regarding the ridiculousness of\ninterpretation (the absurdity of the meaning is known as\nzeugma \u2013 though it should probably be known as syllepsis). These\njudgments can be difficult to make, especially in tricky philosophical\ncases, so we must treat the results of the tests with care.\n",
