    "main_text": "Logic || The Subject Matter of Logic and Its Division: The Logic of Second Intentions\n4.2 The Subject Matter of Logic and Its Division: The Logic of Second Intentions\n\nBrito also puts forth the most developed account of the\nthirteenth-century logic of intentions (for Brito\u2019s logic, see\nPinborg 1967, 1971, 1975a; Ebbesen 1998a). His logic of intentions\nconsiders the subject matter of logic to be second\n intentions[6]\n (intentiones secundae), which are best understood as\nqualified fundamental concepts (first intentions). A first intention\nis the first intellectual apprehension of a thing\u2014the\nunqualified concept that only grasps what a thing essentially is. A\nsecond intention, in turn, is a first intention qualified according to\none of the several modes of being that things have. For instance, the\nconcept of man can be understood as a substance because its content is\nthe substantial form of individual men, or it can be understood as a\nspecies because its content actually informs several individuals at\nthe same time, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981\u20131982: 307).\n\nSince first and second intentions are essentially related to a\ncognitive object, depending on whether the cognitive relation is taken\nfrom the side of the thinking subject or from the side of the object,\nfirst and second intentions can be abstract or concrete. Accordingly,\nman, insofar as it is known through its concept, is a concrete first\nintention; its concept is an abstract first intention. On the other\nhand, man, understood as a species of animal, is a concrete second\nintention; the concept of man thus qualified is an abstract second\nintention, etc. (QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981\u20131982: 307).\n\nBrito goes on to claim that, more precisely, the subject matter of\nlogic is concrete second intentions. The subsequent division\nof logic must then correspond to a division of concrete second\nintentions. Such a division is deduced from the three cognitive\noperations of the intellect: apprehension, composition/division, and\ndeduction (Ebbesen and Pinborg 1981-1982: 309). A second intention\nqualifies the object of some of these intellectual operations.\nCorrespondingly, the Categories deals with concrete second\nintentions understood through intellectual apprehension (e.g., man as\nsubstance, whiteness as quality, etc.). De interpretatione\ndeals with concrete second intentions understood through composition\nand division (e.g., man as subject, white as predicate, a man being\nwhite as an assertion, etc.). Both Analytics, the\nTopics, and Sophistical Refutations deal with\nconcrete second intentions understood through deduction. In other\nwords, these treatises deal with things insofar as they are related to\na syllogistic process, e.g., with the premise that every man is an\nanimal (in the Prior Analytics), with the probability of a\nman being white (in the Topics), with the necessity of every\nman being an animal (in the Posterior Analytics), etc.\n(QsP; see Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981\u20131982: 309 and 311).\n\nOf particular importance is the difference between concrete second\nintentions as they are dealt with in the Prior Analytics on\nthe one hand, and in the Topics and the Posterior\nAnalytics on the other. For the Prior Analytics deals\nwith second intentions related to a syllogistic process, regardless of\nwhether its premises are probable or necessary, whereas the\nTopics and the Posterior Analytics deal with those\nsecond intentions whereby the premises are qualified as probable or\nnecessary, respectively. Therefore, while the Prior Analytics\ndeals with the intentions involved in a syllogistic deduction only\nwith regard to its mood and figure, the Topics and the\nPosterior Analytics deal with these intentions with regard to\ntheir probability and necessity (QsP; see Ebbesen &\nPinborg 1981\u20131982: 311 and 313).\n\nBrito\u2019s logic of intentions also allows him to explain away a\nconcern that had troubled earlier commentators of Aristotle\u2019s\nlogic, such as Nicholas of Paris and Robert Kilwardby, namely the fact\nthat simple words, such as \u2018man\u2019, are discussed in the\nCategories, De interpretatione and Prior\nAnalytics (see Mora-M\u00e1rquez 2015b: 71). If, they thought,\na discussion of simple words belongs in logic at all, then at least it\nought to be found in precisely one treatise. However, since logic, for\nBrito, deals with man as a concrete second intention rather than as a\nword or a thing, the problem does not arise. In fact,\nthe Categories discusses man insofar as it is a substance;\nthe De interpretatione insofar as it is a subject of\npredication; and the Prior Analytics insofar as it is a term,\ni.e., the major, minor or middle term of a syllogism (QsP;\nsee Ebbesen & Pinborg 1981\u20131982: 313).\n\nFinally, Brito\u2019s logic of intentions results in a major\ndeparture from the logical tradition represented by Kilwardby and his\ncontemporaries: the exclusion of truth from the realm of logic (see\nMora-M\u00e1rquez 2015b: ch. 4). According to Brito, logic does not\ndeal with truth because it does not deal with real things per se, and\nreal things, regardless of whatever second intentions they may fall\nunder, are the truth-makers of assertions (QPm;\nQPm-1980: 138\u2013139). The truth of an assertion such as\n\u2018every man is an\n animal\u2019[7]\n depends on a real identity holding between man and animal\u2014a\nreal identity that is independent of the fact that man is a species, a\nsubject, a substance, etc. In other words, such an identity is\nindependent of the second intentions that qualify the cognitive\napprehension of man. Despite this, second intentions do play a role in\nthe validity of deductions that have \u2018every man is an\nanimal\u2019 as a premise, for second intentions are the principles\nof a syllogism\u2019s validity. But they are not the principles of an\nassertion\u2019s truth or falsity, and hence truth is no longer a\nlogical concern. \n",
