    "main_text": "Statistical models || .2 Formal learning theory\n6. Related topics\n\nThere are numerous topics in the philosophy of science that bear\ndirect relevance to the themes covered in this lemma. A few central\ntopics are mentioned here to direct the reader to related lemmas in\nthe encyclopedia. \nOne very important topic that is immediately adjacent to the\nphilosophy of statistics is \n confirmation theory, \nthe philosophical theory that describes and justifies\nrelations between scientific theory and empirical\nevidence. Arguably, the theory of statistics is a proper part of\nconfirmation theory, as it describes and justifies the relation that\nobtains between statistical theory and evidence in the form of\nsamples. It can be insightful to place statistical procedures in this\nwider framework of relations between evidence and theory. Zooming out\neven further, the philosophy of statistics is part of the\nphilosophical topic of methodology, i.e., the general theory on\nwhether and how science acquires knowledge. Thus conceived, statistics\nis one component in a large collection of scientific methods\ncomprising concept formation, experimental design, manipulation and\nobservation, confirmation, revision, and theorizing.\nThere are also a fair number of specific topics from the philosophy\nof science that are spelled out in terms of statistics or that are\nlocated in close proximity to it. One of these topics is the process\nof measurement, in particular the measurement of latent variables on\nthe basis of statistical facts about manifest variables.  The\nso-called representational theory of measurement (Kranz et al\n1971) relies on statistics, in particular on factor analysis, to\nprovide a conceptual clarification of how mathematical structures\nrepresent empirical phenomena. Another important topic form the\nphilosophy of science is causation (see the entries on\n probabilistic causation\nand\n Reichenbach's common cause principle). \nPhilosophers have employed probability theory to capture causal\nrelations ever since Reichenbach (1956), but more recent work in\ncausality and statistics (e.g., Spirtes et al 2001) has given the\ntheory of probabilistic causality an enormous impulse. Here\nagain, statistics provides a basis for the conceptual analysis of\ncausal relations.\nAnd there is so much more.  Several specific statistical\ntechniques, like factor analysis and the theory of Bayesian networks,\ninvite conceptual discussion of their own accord. Numerous topics\nwithin the philosophy of science lend themselves to statistical\nelucidation, e.g., the coherence, informativeness, and surprise of\nevidence. And in turn there is a wide range of discussions in the\nphilosophy of science that inform a proper understanding of\nstatistics. Among them are debates over experimentation and\nintervention, concepts of chance, the nature of scientific models, and\ntheoretical terms. The reader is invited to consult the entries on\nthese topics to find further indications of how they relate to the\nphilosophy of statistics.\n",
