    "main_text": "Historical Survey\n1. Historical Survey\n\nWilliam of Sherwood, writing from an Oxford perspective in the 1240s,\nidentified four properties of terms: \u201cThere are four properties\nof terms that we intend to distinguish now \u2026 These properties\nare signification, supposition, copulation, and appellation\u201d\n(tr. Kretzmann, p.\n 105).[1]\n A different tradition is represented by Peter of Spain and Lambert of\nAuxerre, namely, that of Paris. Lambert identifies five properties of\nterms: \u201cthere are many properties of a term, namely,\nsupposition, appellation, restriction, distribution, and relation\n\u2026 But, because signification is, as it were, the perfection of\na term, and because the properties of a term are founded on\nsignification, one ought for the sake of clarity in what follows to\nsee at the outset what the signification of a term is and how it\ndiffers from supposition\u201d (tr. Maloney, p.\n 253).[2]\n In his treatment he includes ampliation (a correlative to\nrestriction) and thereby matches the sections in Peter of\nSpain\u2019s Tractatus: De suppositionibus (On\nSuppositions), De relativis (On Anaphora), De\nampliationibus (On Ampliations), De appellationibus (On\nAppellations), De restrictionibus (On Restrictions), De\ndistributionibus (On Distribution).\n\nTo these must be added further properties of terms which were\nimportant in the theory\u2019s gestation in the twelfth century but\nwere later no longer included as distinct properties: univocation,\nequivocation, adjectivation, substantivation and so on. From the\nfourteenth century onwards, other properties were also abandoned, so\nthat finally the important lasting properties were signification,\nsupposition, ampliation and restriction, and relation (that is, the\nsupposition of relatives, i.e., anaphora).\n\nFrom its beginnings in the twelfth century, the primary distinction\nwas that between signification, sometimes known as univocation, and\nappellation, later known as supposition. As early as Anselm\u2019s\nDe Grammatico we find a distinction between significare\nper se (signify in itself) and significare per aliud\n(signify relatively). The latter was also known as appellare\n(to name or appellate). Whereas in the former (per se) what\nwas signified was a form, in the latter (per aliud) what was\nsignified, or appellated, was a thing. A single form is common to a\nnumber of things we call by the same name, so one crucial problem in\nthe philosophy of language is to understand how the different uses of\na name are unified in the face of the distinctness of the many\nindividuals talked about. In this way, we can understand the\nimportance in the twelfth century of univocation in contrast with\nappellation. Proper names, naming single items, are contrasted with\nappellative names, naming many. Univocation is the signification of a\nunivocal word, described in the Fallacie Parvipontane as\n\u201cretaining the signification of the name while varying its\nsupposition/appellation\u201d (my\n translation).[3]\n Thus a fallacy of univocation occurs when one does not realise that\nwhat were being talked about (the supposita or appellata) change. For\nexample, to infer \u2018A dodo lives\u2019 from \u2018A dodo\nlived\u2019 is a fallacy (of univocation) since the former is false\n(there are no living dodos for \u2018dodo\u2019 to stand for) while\nthe latter is true (for the past tense ampliates \u2018dodo\u2019 to\nstand for past dodos \u2013 see\n section 4).[4]\n\nThroughout much of the twelfth century, \u2018supposition\u2019\nretained the linguistic sense it had had since at least the time of\nPriscian (early 6th century CE), namely, the placing of a name as\n subject.[5]\n The relation of that name as subject to the thing named was called\nits appellation. This was the ability of a univocal appellative noun\nto name different things. The appellation of a name was not fixed,\nhowever. It could be ampliated or restricted by the predicate. So, for\nexample, the predicate \u2018opinabilis\u2019 (credible)\nampliates or extends the appellation of a name such as\n\u2018man\u2019 to cover a wider range, perhaps of no longer\nexisting men, or of men who might have existed, or who might exist in\nthe future. Thus, appellation came to mean the present correct\napplication of a term (William of Sherwood, ed. Lohr et al., p. 265;\ntr. Kretzmann, p. 106), which could be ampliated, or even restricted\nby, say, the apposition of an adjective: \u2018white man\u2019\nappellates only white men, not all even presently existing men.\n\nDe Rijk (1982, pp. 165\u20136) identifies the three stages in the\ndevelopment of the theory of properties of terms: in the first,\nappellation takes centre stage; in the second, appellation theory is\nextended to capture all uses of terms as subject; in the final stage,\nall other properties are grouped under supposition as the overarching\nnotion and \u2018appellation\u2019 underwent its own transformation.\n(See also Kann 2016.) Thus supposition became the leading property of\nan occurrence of a term in a proposition (including now predicates,\nand even parts of predicates), distinguishing what in particular was\nbeing spoken of on some occasion of utterance by some particular use\nof a word (supposition), from that word\u2019s general property of\nmeaning (signification). The term \u2018man\u2019 signifies the form\nof man wherever the term occurs, but each occurrence of the term\n\u2018man\u2019 supposits for the individuals in possibly distinct\nclasses or groups of men (note that it supposits for the men, not the\nclasses).\n\nGiven the literal meaning of \u2018supponere\u2019 as\n\u201cacting as subject\u201d, it is unsurprising that several\nauthors, even as late as Vincent Ferrer in the 1370s, restricted\nsupposition to subject terms, preferring to speak instead of\ncopulation as the corresponding property of the predicate. Those\nreservations aside, however, the natural similarity in function of\nsubject and predicate in picking out varying classes of things while\nremaining a univocal term led most authors to extend the notion of\nsupposition to all terms. Burley (2000, p. 80) says that\n\u201csupposition properly so called is a property of a subject term\nrelative to the predicate\u201d. However, \u201csupposition taken\nbroadly is a property of a term relative to another in a proposition.\nIn this sense, supposition belongs to the subject as well as to the\npredicate, and even to the verb.\u201d At the same time, talk of\nunivocation was superseded by signification, by implication univocal\nsignification unless equivocation was\n identified.[6]\n\nA major shift in focus occurred in the early fourteenth century,\nprobably occasioned by Ockham \u2013 certainly, he was the leading\nfigure among the terminists, those who focussed \u201con terms as the\nbasic unit of logical analysis\u201d (Ashworth 2010, p. 146). For the\nnominalists, signification came to be understood entirely\nextensionally, given their antipathy towards real universals.\nAccordingly, what was taken to be signified by a term were the things\nof which it can be truly predicated instead of a form or property\nwhich they share. For example, whereas hitherto the term\n\u2018man\u2019 had been taken to signify humanity, and\n\u2018white\u2019 whiteness, for Ockham the former signifies (all)\nmen and the latter all white things. From this perspective, the\ncontrast found in thirteenth century authors between (as Peter of\nSpain called it) natural and accidental supposition, becomes less\nimportant. Natural supposition was the term\u2019s natural or nomic\nextension, accidental supposition that range of things it supposited\nfor in a particular proposition. For Peter, the term itself signifies\na form, and supposits naturally for a class of objects, whereas an\noccurrence of the term supposits accidentally on an occasion of use\nfor a group of those objects. For Ockham, the term signifies that\nclass, the form being no more than a fictum (a figment of the\nmind) or (in his later works) the mental act (of conceiving of those\nthings) itself.\n\nFrom the early fourteenth century, signification and supposition came\nto dominate among the properties. Ampliation and restriction were\nalready functions of supposition (or appellation as it had been),\ncopulation as the naming function of predication was also subsumed\nunder supposition, and relatio, the connection of anaphoric\nterms to their antecedents, becamse a matter of the supposition of\nthose terms. Finally, distribution was treated as a particular mode or\ntype of supposition, confused and distributive supposition. Indeed, in\nthe final phase, it could seriously be asked whether supposition was\nindeed a property of terms, as does Albert of Saxony (Quaestiones\ncirca Logicam, q. 12). For like many others, following Peter of\nSpain (2014, p. 240), he defines supposition as \u2018acceptio\ntermini\u2019 (the act of acceptance of a term) of various\nkinds, and so supposition is as much a property of the speaker or\nhearer as of the term.\n",
