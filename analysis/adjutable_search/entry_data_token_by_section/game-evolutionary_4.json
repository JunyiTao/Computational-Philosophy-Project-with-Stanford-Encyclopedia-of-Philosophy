    "main_text": "Why Evolutionary Game Theory? || The problem of hyperrational agents\n4.2 The problem of hyperrational agents\nThe traditional theory of games imposes a very high\nrationality requirement upon agents. This requirement originates in\nthe development of the theory of utility which provides game\ntheory\u2019s underpinnings (see Luce and Raiffa, 1957, for an\nintroduction). For example, in order to be able to assign a cardinal\nutility function to individual agents, one typically assumes that each\nagent has a well-defined, consistent set of preferences over the set\nof \u201clotteries\u201d over the outcomes which may result from\nindividual choice. Since the number of different lotteries over\noutcomes is uncountably infinite, this requires each agent to have a\nwell-defined, consistent set of uncountably infinitely many\npreferences.\n\nNumerous results from experimental economics have shown that these\nstrong rationality assumptions do not describe the behavior of real\nhuman subjects. Humans are rarely (if ever) the hyperrational agents\ndescribed by traditional game theory. For example, it is not uncommon\nfor people, in experimental situations, to indicate that they prefer\n\\(A\\) to \\(B, B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(C\\) to \\(A\\). These \u201cfailures\nof the transitivity of preference\u201d would not occur if people had\na well-defined consistent set of preferences. Furthermore, experiments\nwith a class of games known as a \u201cbeauty pageant\u201d show,\nquite dramatically, the failure of common knowledge assumptions\ntypically invoked to solve\n games.[8]\n Since evolutionary game theory successfully explains the predominance\nof certain behaviors of insects and animals, where strong rationality\nassumptions clearly fail, this suggests that rationality is not as\ncentral to game theoretic analyses as previously thought. The hope,\nthen, is that evolutionary game theory may meet with greater success\nin describing and predicting the choices of human subjects, since it\nis better equipped to handle the appropriate weaker rationality\nassumptions. Indeed, one of the great strengths of the framework\nintroduced by Sandholm (2010) is that it provides a general method for\nlinking the learning rules used by individuals, at the micro level,\nwith the dynamics describing changes in the population, at the macro\nlevel.\n",
