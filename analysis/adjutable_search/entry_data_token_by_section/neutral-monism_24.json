    "main_text": "New Directions for Neutral Monism || Complex Basic Entities\n5.3 Complex Basic Entities\n\nIn his book Mind and Cosmos (2012) Thomas Nagel asserts that\n\u201cthe weight of the evidence favors some form of neutral monism\nover the traditional alternatives of materialism, idealism, and\ndualism\u201d (2012: 5). Neutral monism is understood as a view that\n\u201caccounts for the relation between mind and brain in terms of\nsomething more basic about the natural order\u201d (2012: 56). This\nyields a picture of a \u201cgeneral monism according to which the\nconstituents of the universe have properties that explain not only its\nphysical but its mental character\u201d (2012: 56). Borrowing a\nconcept from Tom Sorrell (whom Nagel cites approvingly), we can say\nthat these basic constituents of the universe are \u201ctransphysical\nand transmental\u201d (2012: 57). All that has been said up to this\npoint supports the view that Nagel endorses neutral monism.\n\nBut what Nagel says next seems to contradict this simple picture. He\nwrites:\n\nEverything, living or not, is constituted from elements having a\nnature that is both physical and nonphysical\u2014that is, capable of\ncombining into mental wholes. So this reductive account can also be\ndescribed as a form of panpsychism: all the elements of the physical\nworld are also mental. (Nagel 2012: 57)\n\n\nNote that the description of the basic constituents has changed from\n\u201ctransphysical and transmental\u201d to \u201cphysical and\nmental\u201d\u2014from the Neither View to the Both\nView. And Nagel is very much aware that these are not the same\nthing. In an earlier paper in which he considers neutral monism, he\nwrites:\n\nthis view would imply that the fundamental constituents of the world,\nout of which everything is composed, are neither physical nor mental\nbut something more basic. This position is not equivalent to\npanpsychism. Panpsychism is, in effect, dualism all the way down. This\nis monism all the way down. (Nagel 2002: 231)\n\n\nIs there a way to overcome this apparent tension and to see these two\nviews as parts of a coherent whole? In a personal communication Prof.\nNagel offered the following explanation:\n\nthe fundamental elements would be neither merely physical nor merely\nmental, but something that was necessarily both physical and mental,\n(or protomental); but since this necessary connection can\u2019t hold\ndirectly between the physical and the mental as we conceive them, it\nwould require that the real character of these fundamental\nconstituents be something more basic that accounts for their being\nboth physical and (proto)mental.\n\n\nThe resulting picture is this. Described at the most fundamental\nlevel, the constituents of the world have properties that are neither\nmental nor physical. These neutral properties of every fundamental\nentity give rise to physical and mental (or protomental) properties.\nThus each fundamental constituent is complex: it has mental (or\nprotomental) properties, it has physical properties, and it has these\ntwo sets of properties as a necessary consequence of its having a\nthird set of properties\u2014the neutral properties.\n\nThe foundational role played by the neutral properties (in the\nNeither Sense) can be taken to suggest that the view is a\nform of neutral monism. This interpretation can be further supported\nby arguing that the neutral properties ground the other properties of\nthe basic entities, and that grounded properties make for \u201cno\naddition to being\u201d. However, it departs from traditional neutral\nmonism in holding that the basic constituents have intrinsic\nphysical and mental (or protomental) properties in addition to the\nneutral\n ones.[23]\n Thus, it is perhaps best characterized as a form of the dual-aspect\ntheory or property dualism. But others might call it a panpsychism\nsince each fundamental entity has mental (or protomental)\nfeatures.\n",
