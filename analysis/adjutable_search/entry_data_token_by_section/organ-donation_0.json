    "main_text": "Organ Retrieval from the Dead\n1. Organ Retrieval from the Dead\n\nThe dead are the major sources of organs for transplantation. For a\nlong time deceased donors came from those declared brain dead, that\nis, those who have irreversibly lost their brain function. In recent\nyears, however, many donors have come from those who have died in the\nsense of circulatory death. Both donation after brain death and\ndonation after circulatory death invite the important\nphilosophical\u2014not just medical\u2014question \u201cwhat is it\nto be dead\u201d? (See the entry on\n the definition of death.)\n\nEven though far more people die than require new organs, organs are\nscarce. Numerous factors affect the retrieval of organs from the dead.\nThese include: the nature of people\u2019s deaths (in only perhaps\nfewer than 1% of deaths can organs currently be taken, and countries\nvary according to the number of strokes, car crashes, shootings, and\nother causes of death that lend themselves to retrieval); the number\nof intensive care units (ICUs) (most donors die there and fewer ICUs\nmakes for fewer donors); the medical factors that determine whether\norgans are retrieved successfully; the logistical factors that\ndetermine the efficient use of available organs; the extent of public\nawareness of transplantation; and the ethical-legal rules for consent\nthat determine who is allowed to block or permit retrieval. Although\nmost of these factors do not raise philosophical questions, it is\nimportant to realize that the main factor that does\u2014the\nethical-legal system for consent\u2014is only one of many that affect\nretrieval rates, and nowhere near the most important at that. One\nshould also bear in mind that the variety of factors plus\nunreliability or incomparability in statistics about retrieval mean\nthat it is hard or impossible to have confidence in many of the causal\nclaims about how consent rules affect retrieval rates.\n\nThis section explains the rules for consent as they operate in\npractice in most countries. It then outlines certain reform proposals,\nmentions the claims of the main affected parties, and, in the light of\nthose claims, evaluates those reform proposals.\n",
