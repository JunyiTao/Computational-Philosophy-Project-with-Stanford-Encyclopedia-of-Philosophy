    "main_text": "Do Types Exist? || .2 Sellars's nominalism\n8. Occurrences\n\n\nAs mentioned in \u00a71 above, there is a related distinction that\nneeds to be mentioned in connection with the type-token\ndistinction. It is that between a thing, or type of thing, and (what\nis best called) an occurrence of it\u2014where an occurrence\nis not necessarily a token. The reason the reader was asked above to\ncount the words in Stein's line in front of the reader's\neyes, was to ensure that tokens would be counted. Tokens are\nconcrete particulars; whether objects or events they have a unique\nspatio-temporal location.  Had the reader been asked to count the\nwords in Stein's line itself, the reader might still have correctly\nanswered either \u2018three\u2019 or \u2018ten\u2019. There are\nexactly three word types, but although there are ten word tokens in a\ntoken copy of the line, there aren't any tokens at all in the line\nitself. The line itself is an abstract type, as is the poem in which\nit first appeared.  Nor are there ten word types in the line, because\nas we just said it contains only the three word types,\n\u2018a,\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018rose,\u2019 each of\nwhich is unique. So what are there ten of? Occurrences of\nwords, as logicians say: three occurrences of the word (type)\n\u2018a,\u2019 three of \u2018is\u2019 and four of\n\u2018rose\u2019. Or, to put it in a more ontologically neutral\nfashion: the word \u2018a\u2019 occurs three times in the line,\n\u2018is\u2019 three times and \u2018rose\u2019 four times.\nSimilarly, the variable \u2018x\u2019 occurs three times in the\nformula \u2018\u2203x (Ax & Bx)\u2019.\n\n\nNow this may seem impossible; how can one and the same thing occur\nmore than once without there being two tokens of it? Simons (1982)\nconcludes that it can't. Wetzel (1993) argues that it is useful to\ndistinguish objects from occurrences of them. For example, in the\nsequence of numbers <0,1,0,1> the very same number, the number\none, occurs twice, yet its first occurrence is distinct from its\nsecond. The notion of an occurrence of x in y involves not\nonly x and y, but also how x is situated in y. Even a\nconcrete object can occur more than once in a\nsequence\u2014the same person occurs twice in the sequence of New\nJersey million dollar lottery winners, remarkably enough. If we think\nof an expression as a sequence, then the air of mystery over\nhow the same identical thing can occur twice vanishes. Does this mean\nthat, in addition to word types and word tokens, word occurrences must\nalso be recognized? Not necessarily; we can unpack the notion of an\noccurrence using \u201coccurs in\u201d if we have the notion of a\nsequence available; see Wetzel 1993 for details.\n\n\nThe need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types\narises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have\nother types of things occurring in them. There are 10,000 (or so)\nnotes in Beethoven's Sonate Path\u00e9tique, but there are\nonly 88 notes (types) the piano can produce. There are supposed to be\nfifty stars (types) in the current Old Glory (type), but the\nfive-pointed star (type) is unique. And what could it mean to say that\nthe very same atom (type), hydrogen, \u201coccurs four times\u201d\nin the methane molecule? Again, the perplexing thing is how the very\nsame thing can \u201coccur\u201d more than once, without there being\nmore than one token of it. Armstrong (1986), Lewis (1986a,b) and\nForrest (1986) called such types \u201cstructural universals\u201d,\nwhich were the subject of a debate among the three. Armstrong and\nForrest defended Armstrong's (1978) view of universals against Lewis,\nwho delineated seven different views of structural universals\ncompatible with Armstrong's theory, and found all of them wanting.\nBasically, Lewis (1986a) assumed that there are two sorts of ways\nstructural universals might be constructed of simpler universals:\nset-theoretically and mereologically. He argued that set-theoretical\nconstructions resulted in ersatz universals, not universals worthy of\nthe name, and that the various mereological constructions just\nresulted in a heap of simpler universals, where there could not be\ntwo of the simpler universals. Wetzel (2008) argues that\nthere is a conception of a structural universal, the \u201coccurrence\nconception\u201d\u2014which is an extension of the occurrence\nconception of expressions mentioned above\u2014that escapes Lewis's\nobjections.\n",
