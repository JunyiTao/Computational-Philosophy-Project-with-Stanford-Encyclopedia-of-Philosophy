    "main_text": "The Logic of Identity\n2. The Logic of Identity\n\nNumerical identity can be characterised, as just done, as the relation\neverything has to itself and to nothing else. But this is circular,\nsince \u201cnothing else\u201d just means \u201cno numerically\nnon-identical thing\u201d. It can be defined, equally circularly\n(because quantifying over all equivalence relations including itself),\nas the smallest equivalence relation (an equivalence relation being\none which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, for example, having\nthe same shape). Other circular definitions are available. Usually it\nis defined as the equivalence relation (or: the reflexive relation)\nsatisfying Leibniz\u2019s Law, the principle of the indiscernibility\nof identicals, that if x is identical with y then\neverything true of x is true of y. Intuitively this\nis right, but only picks out identity uniquely if \u201cwhat is true\nof x\u201d is understood to include \u201cbeing identical\nwith x\u201d; otherwise it is too weak. Circularity is thus\nnot avoided. Nevertheless, Leibniz\u2019s Law appears to be crucial\nto our understanding of identity, and, more particularly, to our\nunderstanding of distinctness: we exhibit our commitment to it\nwhenever we infer from \u201cFa\u201d and\n\u201cNot-Fb\u201d that a is not identical with\nb. Strictly, what is being employed in such inferences is the\ncontrapositive of Leibniz\u2019s Law (if something true of a\nis false of b, a is not identical with b),\nwhich some (in the context of the discussion of vague identity) have\nquestioned, but it appears as indispensable to our grip on the concept\nof identity as Leibniz\u2019s Law itself.\n\nThe converse of Leibniz\u2019s Law, the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles, that if everything true of x is true of\ny, x is identical with y, is\ncorrespondingly trivial if \u201cwhat is true of x\u201d is\nunderstood to include \u201cbeing identical with x\u201d\n(as required if Leibniz\u2019s Law is to characterise identity\nuniquely among equivalence relations). But often it is read with\n\u201cwhat is true of x\u201d restricted, e.g., to\nqualitative, non-relational, properties of x. It then becomes\nphilosophically controversial. Thus it is debated whether a\nsymmetrical universe is possible, e.g., a universe containing two\nqualitatively indistinguishable spheres and nothing else (Black\n1952).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Law has itself been subject to controversy in the\nsense that the correct explanation of apparent counter-examples has\nbeen debated. Leibniz\u2019s Law must be clearly distinguished from\nthe substitutivity principle, that if \u201ca\u201d and\n\u201cb\u201d are codesignators (if\n\u201ca=b\u201d is a true sentence of English)\nthey are everywhere substitutable salva veritate. This\nprinciple is trivially false. \u201cHesperus\u201d contains eight\nletters, \u201cPhosphorus\u201d contains ten, but Hesperus (the\nEvening Star) is Phosphorus (the Morning Star). Again, despite the\nidentity, it is informative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus,\nbut not to be told that Hesperus is Hesperus (\u201cOn Sense and\nReference\u201d in Frege 1969). Giorgione was so-called because of\nhis size, Barbarelli was not, but Giorgione was Barbarelli (Quine,\n\u201cReference and Modality\u201d, in 1963) . It is a necessary\ntruth that 9 is greater than 7, it is not a necessary truth that the\nnumber of planets is greater than 7, although 9 is the number of\nplanets. The explanation of the failure of the substitutivity\nprinciple can differ from case to case. In the first example, it is\nplausible to say that \u201c\u2018Hesperus\u2019 contains eight\nletters\u201d is not about Hesperus, but about the name, and the same\nis true, mutatis mutandis, of \u201c\u2018Phosphorus\u2019\ncontains ten letters\u201d. Thus the names do not have the same\nreferents in the identity statement and the predications. In the\nGiorgione/Barbarelli example this seems less plausible. Here the\ncorrect explanation is plausibly that \u201cis so-called because of\nhis size\u201d expresses different properties depending on the name\nit is attached to, and so expresses the property of being called\n\u201cBarbarelli\u201d because of his size when attached to\n\u201cBarbarelli\u201d and being called \u201cGiorgione\u201d\nbecause of his size when attached to \u201cGiorgione\u201d. It is\nmore controversial how to explain the Hesperus/Phosphorus and 9/the\nnumber of planets examples. Frege\u2019s own explanation of the\nformer was to assimilate it to the\n\u201cHesperus\u201d/\u201cPhosphorus\u201d case: in \u201cIt is\ninformative to be told that Hesperus is Phosphorus\u201d the names do\nnot stand for their customary referent but for their senses. A Fregean\nexplanation of the 9/number of planets example may also be offered:\n\u201cit is necessary that\u201d creates a context in which\nnumerical designators stand for senses rather than numbers.\n\nFor present purposes the important point to recognise is that, however\nthese counter-examples to the substitutivity principle are explained,\nthey are not counter-examples to Leibniz\u2019s Law, which says\nnothing about substitutivity of codesignators in any language.\n\nThe view of identity just put forward (henceforth \u201cthe classical\nview\u201d) characterises it as the equivalence relation which\neverything has to itself and to nothing else and which satisfies\nLeibniz\u2019s Law. These formal properties ensure that, within any\ntheory expressible by means of a fixed stock of one- or many-place\npredicates, quantifiers and truth-functional connectives, any two\npredicates which can be regarded as expressing identity (i.e., any\npredicates satisfying the two schemata \u201cfor all x,\nRxx\u201d and \u201cfor all x, for all y,\nRxy \u2192 (Fx \u2192 Fy)\u201d for any\none-place predicate in place of \u201cF\u201d) will be\nextensionally equivalent. They do not, however, ensure that any\ntwo-place predicate does express identity within a particular theory,\nfor it may simply be that the descriptive resources of the theory are\ninsufficiently rich to distinguish items between which the equivalence\nrelation expressed by the predicate holds (\u201cIdentity\u201d in\nGeach 1972).\n\nFollowing Geach, call a two-place predicate with these properties in a\ntheory an \u201cI-predicate\u201d in that theory. Relative to\nanother, richer, theory the same predicate, interpreted in the same\nway, may not be an I-predicate. If so it will not, and did not even in\nthe poorer theory, express identity. For example, \u201chaving the\nsame income as\u201d will be an I-predicate in a theory in which\npersons with the same income are indistinguishable, but not in a\nricher theory.\n\nQuine (1950) has suggested that when a predicate is an I-predicate in\na theory only because the language in which the theory is expressed\ndoes not allow one to distinguish items between which it holds, one\ncan reinterpret the sentences of the theory so that the I-predicate in\nthe newly interpreted theory does express identity. Every sentence\nwill have just the same truth-conditions under the new interpretation\nand the old, but the references of its subsentential parts will be\ndifferent. Thus, Quine suggests, if one has a language in which one\nspeaks of persons and in which persons of the same income are\nindistinguishable the predicates of the language may be reinterpreted\nso that the predicate which previously expressed having the same\nincome comes now to express identity. The universe of discourse\nnow consists of income groups, not people. The extensions of the\nmonadic predicates are classes of income groups, and, in general, the\nextension of an n-place predicate is a class of\nn-member sequences of income groups (Quine 1963:\n65\u201379). Any two-place predicate expressing an equivalence\nrelation could be an I-predicate relative to some sufficiently\nimpoverished theory, and Quine\u2019s suggestion will be applicable\nto any such predicate if it is applicable at all.\n\nBut it remains that it is not guaranteed that a two-place predicate\nthat is an I-predicate in the theory to which it belongs expresses\nidentity. In fact, no condition can be stated in a first-order\nlanguage for a predicate to express identity, rather than mere\nindiscernibility by the resources of the language. However, in a\nsecond-order language, in which quantification over all\nproperties (not just those for which the language contains predicates)\nis possible and Leibniz\u2019s Law is therefore statable, identity\ncan be uniquely characterised. Identity is thus not first-order, but\nonly second-order definable.\n",
