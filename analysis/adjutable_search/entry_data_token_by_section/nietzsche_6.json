Difficulties of Nietzsche\u2019s Philosophical Writing\n\nFor all the novelty of Nietzsche\u2019s doctrines and the apparent\nextremity of his criticisms of traditional morality, religion, and\nphilosophy, perhaps nothing about his work seems more out of step with\nthe ordinary procedures of philosophy than the way he writes. The\npoint is sufficiently obvious that it has by now become an entirely\nconventional trope to begin commentaries with remarks about the\nunconventional character of Nietzsche\u2019s style. Despite\nthe attention it gets, however, we continue to lack anything like a\ncomprehensive account of Nietzsche\u2019s strategies as a writer and\nrhetorician. Most of us (this entry included) are defeated by the\nbewildering richness of the subject matter and content ourselves with\na few observations of special relevance to our other purposes. Perhaps\nAlexander Nehamas (1985: 13\u201341) comes closest to meeting the\nexplanatory challenge by highlighting the key underlying fact that\ndefeats our interpretive efforts\u2014the seemingly endless variety\nof stylistic effects that Nietzsche deploys. In doing so, he follows\nthe lead of Nietzsche\u2019s own retrospective assessment from\nEcce Homo: \u201cI have many stylistic\npossibilities\u2014the most multifarious art of style that has ever\nbeen at the disposal of one man\u201d (EH III, 4). This\nentry will focus on a few points useful for readers making their early\napproaches to Nietzsche\u2019s texts.\n\nNietzsche\u2019s most obvious departure from conventional\nphilosophical writing is the basic plan and construction of his books.\nMost philosophers write treatises or scholarly articles, governed by a\ncarefully articulated thesis for which they present a sustained\nargument. Nietzsche\u2019s books are nothing like that. Many are\ndivided into short, numbered sections, which only sometimes have\nobvious connections to nearby sections. While the sections within a\npart are often thematically related (see, e.g., GS Book II or\nBGE Parts I, V, VI), even then they do not typically fit\ntogether into a single overall argument. Nietzsche himself notes the\nbriskness with which he treats his concerns, insisting that \u201cI\napproach deep problems like cold baths: quickly into them and quickly\nout again\u201d (GS 381). To the natural complaint that such\ntelegraphic treatment courts misunderstanding, he replies that\n\n\nOne does not only wish to be understood when one writes; one wishes\njust as surely not to be understood. \u2026 [Some authors]\ndid not wish to be understood by \u201cjust anybody\u201d.\n(GS 381)\n\n\nSome of Nietzsche\u2019s books (notably The Birth of\nTragedy, the Genealogy, and the Antichrist)\noffer greater continuity of argumentation, but even there, he will\noften take advantage of section breaks to drop one thread of reasoning\nand move on to apparently unrelated points, leaving the reader to\npiece together how the various aspects of his case are supposed to fit\ntogether (GM II is a notoriously challenging case in point;\nsee Reginster 2018b, 2021). Thus Spoke Zarathustra is unified\nby following the career of a central character, but the unity is loose\nand picaresque-like\u2014a sequence of episodes which arrives at a\nsomewhat equivocal (or at a minimum, at a controversial)\nconclusion that imposes only weak narrative unity on the whole.\n\nThis mode of writing is often classified as \u201caphoristic\u201d,\nand Nietzsche is rightly granted an honored place within the\ndistinguished lineage of that form in German philosophy, which goes\nback at least to Georg Lichtenberg\u2019s Waste Books.\nLichtenberg wrote his fragments for himself rather than the public,\nbut the strategies he developed nevertheless made a serious impact.\nHis aphorisms revealed how the form could be extended from its\nessentially pedagogical origins (providing compressed, memorable form\nfor some principle or observation) into a sustained, exploratory mode\nof reasoning with oneself. Schopenhauer was a particular admirer, and\nhis pursuit of the form (especially in Parerga and\nParalipomena) clearly influenced Nietzsche\u2019s use of the\ntechnique to frame his psychological observations\u2014(the French\nmoralistes were also an important influence; see Pippin\n2010).\n\nSome of Nietzsche\u2019s efforts consist in straightforward\npsychological analysis, like this\u2014\u201cEgoism is the law of\nperspective applied to feelings: what is closest appears large and\nweighty, and as one moves further away size and weight decrease\u201d\n(GS 162)\u2014while others encapsulate a point Nietzsche has\nbeen developing through the section (see, e.g., \u201cWe are always\nonly in our own company\u201d; GS 166). More distinctively,\nhowever, many Nietzschean aphorisms rely on a \u201ctwist\u201d\neffect\u2014the first part sets up a certain expectation, which is\nthen controverted or deepened by a thought-provoking reversal in the\nsecond part. Occasionally, these aphorisms are even set up as\nmini-dialogues:\n\n\nA: \u201cOne is praised only by one\u2019s peers.\u201d\n\nB: \u201cYes, and whoever praises you says: I am your peer\u201d.\n(GS 190)\n\n\nMany aphorisms exhibiting this sort of \u201ctwist\u201d trade on\nthe type of cynicism typical in moralistes like La\nRochefoucauld, but however much he learned from the French, Nietzsche\nbrought larger ambitions to the form; he is equally willing to leave\ncynicism behind and deploy the twist form simply to provoke active\nreflection in the reader, as he does here: \u201cEvery habit lends\nour hand more wit but makes our wit less handy\u201d (GS\n247). Kaufmann ([1950] 1974: 72\u201395) famously suggested that\nNietzsche coined his aphorisms in the service of an\n\u201cexperimentalist\u201d mode of philosophizing, and there is\nsomething to the idea. But the reader should take care, for not every\nNietzschean aphorism is an experiment, and not every short section is\nan aphorism. Indeed, many multi-sentence sections build up to\nan aphorism, which enters only as a proper part included within the\nsection, perhaps serving as its culmination or a kind of summative\nconclusion (rather than an experiment).\n\nA particularly important case in point is the \u201caphorism placed\nbefore this [Third] treatise\u201d of the Genealogy, which\nNietzsche\u2019s Preface (GM Pref., 8) offers to the reader\nas an especially good example of the densely summative power of the\nform\u2014the entire Third Treatise is supposed to be just an\ninterpretation of that aphorism. Maudemarie Clark (1997), John Wilcox\n(1997), and Christopher Janaway (1997) showed convincingly that the\naphorism in question appears in section 1 of the Third Treatise, and\nis not the Treatise\u2019s epigram. But the first section itself is\nnot simply one long aphorism. Instead, the aphorism that requires so\nmuch interpretation is the compressed, high-impact arrival point of\nGM III, 1; the section begins by noting a series of different\nthings that the ascetic ideal has meant, listed one after another and\nserving as a kind of outline for the Treatise, before culminating in\nthe taut aphorism:\n\n\nThat the ascetic ideal has meant so much to man, however, is\nan expression of the basic fact of the human will, its horror\nvacui: it needs a goal,\u2014and it would rather will\nnothingness than not will. (GM III, 1)\n\n\n(It is to this compressed formulation, not the entirety of the\nsection, that Nietzsche returns when he wraps up his interpretation in\nGM III, 28.)\n\nNietzsche\u2019s proclivity for aphorisms is responsible for some of\nthe difficulty of his writing; these formulations stand out from their\nbackground context, making it harder to integrate Nietzsche\u2019s\ndiscourse from one section to the next. But the aphoristic form is\nonly one challenge among many. As has been widely noted (by every\nreader, I suppose, but see Blondel [1971] 1977; Derrida 1978; de Man\n1979; Kofman [1983] 1993; Nehamas 1985; Higgins 1987, 2000; Thomas\n1999), Nietzsche\u2019s writing is full of figures of speech and\nliterary tropes, and decoding these modes of indirection demands\nactive engagement and subtlety from the reader. Indeed, some of\nNietzsche\u2019s most favored and widespread figures (e.g.,\nhyperbole, litotes, irony) involve purposely saying something more, or\nless, or other than one means, and so forcing the reader to adjust.\nWhat is more, Nietzsche makes heavy use of allusions to both\ncontemporary and historical writing, and without that context one is\nvery likely to miss his meaning\u2014BGE 11\u201315 offers\na particularly dense set of examples; see Clark and Dudrick (2012:\n87\u2013112) for one reading to which Hussain (2004), Anderson\n(2002), and Riccardi (2011) propose alternatives. Almost as often,\nNietzsche invents a persona so as to work out some view that he will\ngo on to qualify or reject (BGE 2 is a clear example), so it\ncan be a steep challenge just to keep track of the various voices in\naction within the text.\n\nNehamas (1988: 46\u201351) offers perhaps the best description of the\ncomplexities of the resulting reading experience: our attention is\nfixated by certain brilliant, striking passages, or even whole\nsections, but because their connections to nearby sections are not\nspecified, and because the text seems to switch from one voice to\nanother, the reader simply moves on, taking each new section on its\nown terms; in short order, one forgets the details, the points, the\ncautions, or even the subject matter of passages several sections\nback\u2014except, perhaps, for a few, especially memorable\nhighlights, which we then call \u201caphorisms\u201d. In this way,\nit is all too easy to fail to read Nietzsche\u2019s books as\nbooks at all. Nevertheless, such comprehensive readings are there\nto be had. Clark and Dudrick (2012) offer a a sustained, albeit\ncontroversial, close reading exploring the unity of Part I of\nBeyond Good and Evil; their efforts reveal the scope of the\ndifficulty\u2014they needed an entire book to explain the allusions\nand connections involved in just twenty-three sections of Nietzsche,\ncovering some couple-dozen pages! Attacking the same problem in a\ndifferent spirit, Nehamas (1988) calls attention to the loose,\n\u201ctrain of thought\u201d-type connections that connect one\nsection to another through large swaths of works like Beyond Good\nand Evil or The Gay Science. Following such connections,\nhe proposes, allows us to understand the books as monologues\npresented by a narrator. For Nehamas, the creation of such a narrative\npersona is central to Nietzsche\u2019s larger project of authorial\nself-fashioning. By contrast, Millgram (2023) counter-proposes that\nNietzsche deploys different \u201cvoices\u201d, different\nnarrators, in his different books (see also Millgram 2007, 2020); and\nrelated papers available in the Other Internet Resources). On this\nless unified picture, the sort of \u201cpersona-inhabiting\u201d\neffect noted above for the obvious case of BGE 2 is a much\nmore widespread and destabilizing feature of Nietzsche\u2019s\nwriting. It becomes a precondition for adequately understanding each\nparticular book that we first work out in what voice Nietzsche means\nto be speaking\u2014and what attitude he, and we, are supposed to\nhave toward that character\u2014before we can assess the work\u2019s\nfirst-order claims and effects.\n\nWhile Millgram\u2019s view is extreme in the demands it takes\nNietzsche\u2019s writing to place on the reader, demands of the broad\nsort he indicates\u2014a demand, for example, to hear\nNietzsche\u2019s interventions in the right tone, or\n\u201cspirit\u201d, if they are to be understood\u2014do\nseem to be imposed by some rather straightforward features of the\ntexts. Consider, for instance, what the point could be of that most\nobvious feature of Nietzsche\u2019s rhetoric\u2014the heat and\nvitriol with which his condemnations of traditional values are\npresented. The Genealogy of Morality advertises itself as\n\u201ca Polemic\u201d, but even in that genre, it is an outlier for\nrhetorical intensity; Nietzsche passes up no opportunity for\nemotionally charged attacks, he repeatedly blasphemes what is held\nmost sacred in the culture, he freely deploys offensive anti-Semitic\ntropes (turned back, ironically, against anti-Semitic Christians\nthemselves), he fairly shouts, he sneers between scare quotes, he\nrepeatedly charges bad faith and dishonesty on the part of his\nopponents, and on and on. It is impossible to conclude that the work\nis not deliberately designed to be as offensive as possible\nto any earnest Christian believer. Why? Given Nietzsche\u2019s\nexpressed conviction that many Christians ought to remain ensconced\nwithin their ideology because it is the best they can do for\nthemselves (that \u201cthe sense [Sinn] of the herd should\nrule in the herd\u201d; KSA 7[6], 12: 280), perhaps the\nright way to understand this much rhetorical overkill is that it\noperates as a strategy for audience partition. In\nNietzsche\u2019s mind, those who cannot do without Christianity and\nits morality would only be harmed by understanding how destructive and\nself-defeating it is; Nietzsche wants to explain those terrible\neffects, but he also wants to protect Christianity-dependent readers\nfrom harm. He achieves both at once by ensuring that exactly those\nreaders will be so offended by his tone that their anger will impair\nunderstanding and they will fail to follow his argument. If this is\nright, the very vitriol of the Genealogy arises from an aim\nto be heard only by the right audience\u2014the one it can\npotentially aid rather than harm\u2014thereby overcoming the problem\nthat\n\n\nThere are books that have opposite values for soul and health,\ndepending on whether the lower soul\u2026 or the higher and more\nvigorous ones turn to them. (BGE 30; compare BGE\n26\u20137, 40 and GS 381)\n\n\nThat such an interpretation of Nietzsche\u2019s intentions is even\npossible shows how great a challenge these explosive, carefully\ncrafted texts pose to their readers.\n",
