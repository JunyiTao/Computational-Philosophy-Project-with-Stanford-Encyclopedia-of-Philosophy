    "main_text": "Mood, Force and Convention || A Biosemantic Species of Force Conventionalism\n4.2 A Biosemantic Species of Force Conventionalism\n\n\nMillikan (1998) espouses a parsimonious conception of conventions that\nshe terms \u2018natural conventions,\u2019 and on the assumption\nthat natural conventions are a type of convention, one would expect\nthis strategy to make it easier to defend the view that speech acts\nare inherently conventional. For Millikan, a natural\nconvention is constituted by patterns that are reproduced by\nvirtue of the weight of \nprecedent.[11] \nA pattern is reproduced just in\ncase it has a form that derives from a previous entity having, in\ncertain respects, the same form, and in such a way that had the\nprevious form been different in those respects, the current form would\nbe different in those respects as well (1998, p.  163). Photocopying\nis one form of reproduction meeting these criteria; the retinotopic\nmapping from patterns of stimulation on the retina to patterns of\nstimulation in the visual cortex is evidently another. Millikan would\nnot treat retinotopic mapping as a type of convention, however, since\nit would not seem to be perpetuated by virtue of the weight of\nprecedent. The point is difficult to discern, however, since in her\ndiscussion of the matter Millikan discusses the conditions under which\na pattern is taken to be conventional, rather than for it to\nbe conventional, writing\n\nTo be thought of as conventional, a reproduced pattern must be\nperceived as proliferated due, in important part, to weight of\nprecedent, not to its intrinsically superior capacity to produce a\ndesired result, or due, say, to ignorance of alternatives (ibid,\np. 166).\n\nMillikan thus seems to characterize what it is for a pattern to\nhave weight of precedent in terms of that pattern\u2019s being perceived to\nhave such weight. This notion is not itself elucidated, and as a\nresult the notion of weight of precedent is left obscure in her\naccount. Nonetheless, she tells us that just as the conventions of\nchess dictate that when one\u2019s king is in check, one does what one can\nto get him out of check; so too the conventions of language dictate\nthat when A tells B that p, B responds by\nbelieving that p. Millikan describes the hearer\u2019s response as a\nhidden, inner act that is not under B\u2019s voluntary control. Millikan\nalso describes this response as being learned in the way that we learn\nwhat she calls \u201cnatural sign patterns,\u201d such as our\nlearning that the sound of crashing waves is an indication of a nearby\ncoastline.\n\n\nOn Millikan\u2019s view, then, A\u2019s assertion of p being\nfollowed by B\u2019s belief that p is a process that is not\nintrinsically superior to others that might have been followed. This\nmay be doubted, however. What, after, all would be viable alternative\nresponses? Disbelieving p? Remaining neutral on the question\nof p? Scratching one\u2019s left earlobe? Any of these responses\nwould tend to undermine the use of language as a means for transmission of\ninformation. What is more, if belief formation is not under the\nvoluntary control of addressees, it is obscure how this aspect of\ncommunication could be conventional, any more than the pattern of\nstimulation of our visual cortex is conventional when that pattern\nresults from an isomorphic pattern on the retina.\n4.3. An Intentionalist Alternative to Force Conventionalism\n\n\nForce-conventionalism as espoused by Austin and later Searle has been\nchallenged by Strawson, who writes,\n\nI do not want to deny that there may be conventional postures or\nprocedures for entreating: one can, for example, kneel down, raise\none\u2019s arms, and say, \u201cI entreat you.\u201d But I do want to\ndeny that an act of entreaty can be performed only as conforming to\nsuch conventions\u2026.[T]o suppose that there is always and necessarily\na convention conformed to would be like supposing that there could be\nno love affairs which did not proceed on lines laid down in\nthe Roman de la Rose or that every dispute between men must\nfollow the pattern specified in Touchstone\u2019s speech about the\ncountercheck quarrelsome and the lie direct. (1964, p. 444)\n\nStrawson contends that rather than appealing to a series of\nextra-semantic conventions to account for the possibility of speech\nacts, we explain that possibility in terms of our ability to discern\none another\u2019s communicative intentions. What makes an utterance\nof a sentence in the indicative mood a prediction rather than a\ncommand, for instance, is that it manifests an intention to be so\ntaken; likewise for promises rather than predictions. This position is\ncompatible with holding that in special cases linguistic communities\nhave instituted conventions for particular speech acts such as\nappointing and excommunicating. So too, as Skinner (1970) observes,\nunderstanding the utterances of an historical figure crucially depends\non sensitivity to conventions of the society in which they are\nmade.\n\n\nIntending to make an assertion, promise, or request, however, is not\nenough to perform one of these acts. Those intentions must be\nefficacious. The same point applies to cases of trying to perform a\nspeech act, even when what one is trying to do is clear to\nothers. This fact emerges from reflecting on an oft-quoted passage\nfrom Searle:\n\nHuman communication has some extraordinary properties, not shared by\nmost other kinds of human behavior. One of the most extraordinary is\nthis: If I am trying to tell someone something, then (assuming certain\nconditions are satisfied) as soon as he recognizes that I am trying to\ntell him something and exactly what it is I am trying to tell him, I\nhave succeeded in telling it to him. (1969, p. 47.)\n\nAs Green 2013 observes, the point may be doubted. Suppose I am\ntrying to work up the courage to ask Sidney\u2019s hand in\nmarriage. Sidney recognizes this fact on the basis of background\nknowledge, my visible embarrassment, and my fumbling in my pocket for\nan engagement ring. Here we cannot infer that I have succeeded in\nasking Sidney anything. Nothing short of coming out and saying it will\ndo. Similarly, it might be common knowledge that my moribund uncle is\ntrying, as he breathes his last, to bequeath me his fortune; still, I\nwon\u2019t inherit a penny if he expires before saying what he was trying\nto.[12] Closer\nto Searle\u2019s example, even if you were to find, on the basis of\nfMRI analysis of my neural activity, that I was trying to tell you\nthat it\u2019s going to rain tomorrow, I still have not asserted\nanything about tomorrow\u2019s weather. (If I were completely\nparalyzed as a result of Locked-In Syndrome, then making such a neural\neffort might be the most I can hope to do; in that case, your fMRI\ninformation might be enough to justify you in taking me to have\nperformed a speech act.)\n\n\nThe gist of these examples is not the requirement that words be\nuttered in every speech act\u2014we have already observed that speech\nacts can be performed silently. Rather, their gist is that speech acts\ninvolve intentional undertaking of a publicly accessible commitment;\nfurther, that commitment is not undertaken simply by virtue of my\nintending to undertake it, even when it is common knowledge that this\nis what I am trying to do. Can we, however, give a more illuminating\ncharacterization of the relevant intentions than merely saying that,\nfor instance, to assert P one must intentionally put\nforth P as an assertion? Strawson (1964) proposes that we can\ndo so with aid of the notion of speaker meaning\u2014to which we now\nturn.\n5. Speaker-Meaning and Force\n\n\nAs we have seen, that A is an important component of\ncommunication, and that A underdetermines B, do not\njustify the conclusion that B is an important component of\ncommunication. One reason for an asymmetry in our treatment of force\nand decibel level is that the former, but not the latter, seems\ncrucial to how I mean what I say. I intend to speak at a certain\nvolume, and sometimes succeed, but in most cases it is no part of how\nI mean what I say that I happen to be speaking at that volume. On the\nother hand, the force of my utterance is an aspect of what I mean. It\nis not, as we have seen, any aspect of what I say\u2014that notion\nbeing closely associated with content. However, whether I mean what I\nsay as an assertion, a conjecture, a promise or something else will be\ncrucial to how I mean what I do.\n5.1 Grice\u2019s Account of Speaker Meaning\n\n\nIn his influential 1957 article, Grice\ndistinguished between two uses of \u2018mean\u2019. One use is\nexemplified by remarks such as \u2018Those clouds mean rain,\u2019\nand \u2018Those spots mean measles.\u2019 The notion of meaning in\nplay in such cases Grice dubs \u2018natural meaning\u2019. Grice\nsuggests that we may distinguish this use of \u2018mean\u2019 from\nanother use of the word more relevant to communication, exemplified\nin such utterances as\n\nIn saying \u201cYou make a better door than a window\u201d, George\nmeant that you should move,\n\nand\n\nIn gesticulating that way, Salvatore means that there\u2019s quicksand over\nthere,\n\nGrice used the term \u2018non-natural meaning\u2019 for this\nuse of \u2018mean\u2019, and in more recent literature this jargon\nhas been replaced with the term \u2018speaker\nmeaning\u2019.[13]\n After distinguishing between natural and\n(what we shall hereafter call) speaker meaning, Grice attempts to\ncharacterize the latter. It is not enough that I do something that\ninfluences the beliefs of an observer: In putting on a coat I might\nlead an observer to conclude that I am going for a walk. Yet in such a\ncase it is not plausible that I mean that I am going for a walk in the\nsense germane to speaker meaning. Might performing an action with an\nintention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs be sufficient for speaker\nmeaning? No: I might secretly leave Smith\u2019s handkerchief at the crime scene to\nmake the police think that Smith is the culprit. However, whether or\nnot I am successful in getting the authorities to think that Smith is\nthe culprit, in this case it is not plausible that I mean that Smith\nis the culprit.\n\n\nWhat is missing in the handkerchief example is the element of\novertness. This suggests another criterion: Performing an action with\nthe, or an, intention of influencing someone\u2019s beliefs, while\nintending that this very intention be recognized. Grice contends that\neven here we do not have enough for speaker meaning. Herod presents\nSalome with St. John\u2019s severed head on a charger, intending that she\ndiscern that St. John is dead and intending that this very intention\nof his be recognized. Grice observes that in so doing Herod is\nnot telling Salome anything, but is instead deliberately and\nopenly letting her know something. Grice concludes that Herod\u2019s action\nis not a case of speaker meaning either. The problem is not that Herod\nis not using words; we have already considered communicators who mean things\nwordlessly. The problem seems to be that to infer what Herod intends\nher to, Salome does not have to take his word for anything. She can\nsee the severed head for herself if she can bring herself to look. By\ncontrast, in its central uses, telling requires a speaker to intend to\nconvey information (or alleged information) in a way that relies\ncrucially upon taking her at her word. Grice appears to assume that at\nleast for the case in which what is meant is a proposition (rather\nthan a question or an imperative), speaker meaning requires a telling\nin this central sense. What is more, this last example is a case of\nperforming an action with an intention of influencing someone\u2019s\nbeliefs, even while intending that this very intention be recognized;\nyet it is not a case of telling. Grice infers that it is not a case of\nspeaker meaning either.\n\n\nGrice holds that for speaker meaning to occur, not only must one (a)\nintend to produce an effect on an audience, and (b) intend that this\nvery intention be recognized by that audience, but also (c) intend this effect on the audience to be produced at least in\npart by their recognition of the speaker\u2019s intention. The intention to\nproduce a belief or other attitude by means (at least in part) of\nrecognition of this very intention, has come to be called\na reflexive communicative intention.\n5.2 Objections to Grice\u2019s Account\n\n\nIt may be doubted that speaker meaning requires reflexive communicative intentions. After all, a mathematics teacher who proves a theorem T for her class likely wants her pupils to believe T on the strength of her proof rather than their recognition of her intention that they come to believe T. (Vlach 1981) It may even be doubted that speaker meaning requires intentions to produce cognitive effects on addressees at all: Davis (1992) provides a range of cases such as speaking to pre-linguistic infants, uncooperative photocopy machines, and photos of deceased loved ones.[14],[15] Instead of intentions to produce psychological effects in an addressee, some authors have advocated a construal of speaker meaning as overtly manifesting an aspect of one\u2019s commitments or state of mind (Green 2019). Compare my going to the closet to take out my overcoat (not a\ncase of speaker meaning), with the following case: After heatedly\narguing about the weather, I march to the closet while beadily meeting\nyour stare, then storm out the front door while ostentatiously donning\nthe coat. Here it is more plausible that I mean that it is raining\noutside, and the reason seems to be that I am making some attitude of\nmine overt: I am not only showing it, I am making clear my intention\nto do just that.\n\n5.3 Force as an Aspect of Speaker Meaning\n\n\nHow does this detour through speaker meaning help to elucidate the\nnotion of force? One way of asserting that P, it seems, is\novertly to manifest my commitment to P, and indeed commitment\nof a particular kind: commitment to defend P in response to\nchallenges of the form, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I must\nalso overtly manifest my liability to be either right or wrong on the\nissue of P depending on whether P is the case. By\ncontrast, I conjecture P by overtly manifesting my commitment\nto P in this same \u201cliability to error\u201d way, but I\nam not committed to responding to challenges demanding full\njustification. I must, however, give some reason for\nbelieving P; this much cannot, however, be said of a\nguess.\n\n\nWe perform a speech act, then, when we overtly commit ourselves in a\ncertain way to a content\u2014where that way is an aspect of how we\nspeaker-mean that content. One way to do that is to invoke a\nconvention for undertaking commitment; another way is overtly to\nmanifest one\u2019s intention to be so committed. We may elucidate the\nrelevant forms of commitment by spelling out the norms underlying\nthem. We have already adumbrated such an approach in our discussion of\nthe differences among asserting and conjecturing. Developing that\ndiscussion a bit further, compare\n\n\nasserting\nconjecturing\nguessing\n\n\n\nAll three of these acts have word-to-world direction of fit, and all\nthree have conditions of satisfaction mandating that they are\nsatisfied just in case the world is as their content says it\nis. Further, one who asserts, conjectures, or guesses that P\nis right or wrong on the issue of P depending on\nwhether P is in fact so. However, as we move down the list we\nfind a decreasing order of stringency in commitment. One who\nasserts P lays herself open to the challenge, \u201cHow do\nyou know that?\u201d, and she is obliged to retract P if she\nis unable to respond to that challenge adequately. By contrast, this\nchallenge is inappropriate for either a conjecture or a guess. On the\nother hand, we may justifiably demand of the conjecturer that she give\nsome reason for her conjecture; yet not even this much may be said of\none who makes a guess. (The \u201ceducated guess\u201d is\nintermediate between these two cases.)\n\n\nThis illocutionary dimension of speaker meaning\ncharacterizes not what is meant, but rather how it is meant. Just as\nwe may consider your remark, directed toward me, \u201cYou\u2019re\ntired,\u201d and my remark, \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d as having said\nthe same thing but in different ways; so too we may consider my\nassertion of P, followed by a retraction and then followed by\na conjecture of P, as two consecutive cases in which I\nspeaker-mean that P but do so in different ways. This idea\nwill be developed further in Section 8 under the rubric of\n\u201cmode\u201d of illocutionary\ncommitment.[16]\n\n\n\nSpeaker meaning, then, encompasses not just content but also force,\nand we may elucidate this in light of the normative structure\ncharacteristic of each speech act: When you overtly display a\ncommitment characteristic of that speech act, you have performed that\nspeech act. Is this a necessary condition as well? That depends on\nwhether I can perform a speech act without intending to do so\u2014a\ntopic for Section 9 below. For now, however, compare the view at which\nwe have arrived with Searle\u2019s view that one performs a speech act when\nothers become aware of one\u2019s intention to perform that act. What is\nmissing from Searle\u2019s characterization is the notion of overtness: The\nagent in question must not only make her intention to undertake a\ncertain commitment manifest; she must also intend that that very\nintention be manifest. There is more to overtness than wearing one\u2019s\nheart (or mind) on one\u2019s sleeve.\n6. Force, Norms, and Conversation\n\nIn elucidating this normative dimension of force, we have sought to\ncharacterize speech acts in terms of their conversational roles. That\nis not to say that speech acts can only be performed in the setting of\na conversation: I can approach you, point out that your vehicle is\nblocking mine, and storm off. Here I have made an assertion but have\nnot engaged in a conversation. Perhaps I can ask myself a question in\nthe privacy of my study and leave it at that\u2013not continuing into\na conversation with myself. However, a speech act\u2019s \u201cecological\nniche\u201d may nevertheless be the conversation. In that spirit,\nwhile we may be able to remove a speech act type from its environment\nand scrutinize it in isolated captivity, doing so may blind us to some\nof its distinctive features.\n6.1 Speech Acts and Conversations\n\nThis ecological analogy sheds light on a dispute over the question\nwhether speech acts can profitably be studied in isolation from the\nconversations in which they occur. An empiricist framework,\nexemplified in John Stuart Mill\u2019s A System\nof Logic, suggests attempting to discern the meaning of a word,\nfor instance a proper name, in isolation. By\ncontrast, Gottlob Frege (1884) enjoins us to\nunderstand a word\u2019s meaning in terms of the contribution it makes to\nan entire sentence. Such a method is indispensable for a proper\ntreatment of such expressions as quantifiers, and represents a major\nadvance over empiricist approaches. Yet students of speech acts have\nespoused going even further, insisting that the unit of significance\nis not the proposition but the speech act. Vanderveken writes,\n\nIllocutionary acts are important for the purpose of philosophical\nsemantics because they are the primary units of meaning in the use and\ncomprehension of natural language. (Vanderveken, 1990, p. 1.)\n\nWhy not go even further, since speech acts characteristically occur\nin conversations? Is the unit of significance really the debate, the\ncolloquy, the interrogation?\n\nStudents of conversation analysis have contended precisely\nthis, remarking that many speech acts fall naturally into\npairs.[17] For\ninstance, questions pair naturally with assertions when the latter\npurport to be answers to those questions. Likewise, offers pair\nnaturally with acceptances or rejections, and it is easy to multiply\nexamples. Searle, who favors studying speech acts in isolation, has\nreplied to these considerations (Searle 1992).  There he issues a\nchallenge to students of conversation to provide an account of\nconversations parallel to that of speech acts, arguing as well that\nthe prospects for such an account are dim. One of his reasons is that\nunlike speech acts conversations do not as such have a point or\npurpose. Green 1999 rejoins that many conversations may indeed be\nconstrued in teleological terms. For instance, many conversations may\nbe construed as aimed at answering a question, even when that question\nconcerns something as banal as the afternoon\u2019s weather or the\nlocation of the nearest subway station. Asher and Lascardes (2003)\ndevelop a systematic treatment of speech acts in their conversational\nsetting that also responds to Searle\u2019s challenge. Additionally,\nRoberts (2004, 2012) develops a model of conversational kinematics\naccording to which conversations are invariably aimed at answering\nwhat she terms a question under discussion (QUD). This view\nis best appreciated within the framework of the \u201cscorekeeping\nmodel\u201d of conversation, to which we now turn.\n6.2 Speech Acts and Scorekeeping\n\nMuch literature concerned with speech acts is curiously disconnected\nfrom research in the semantics of natural language emphasizing\npragmatic factors. For instance, Stalnaker (1972, 1973, 1974), Lewis\n(1979, 1980), Thomason (1990) and others have developed models of the\nkinematics of conversations aimed at understanding the role of\nquantification, presupposition (both semantic and pragmatic),\nanaphora, deixis, and vagueness in discourse. Such models typically\nconstrue conversations as involving an ever-developing set of\nPropositions that can be presupposed by interlocutors. This set of\nPropositions is the conversational common ground, defined as\nthat set of Propositions that all interlocutors take to be true, while\nalso taking it that all other interlocutors take them to be true. If a\nProposition p is in a conversation\u2019s common ground, then a speaker may\nfelicitously presuppose p\u2019s truth. Suppose then that the\nProposition that Singapore has a unique King is in a\nconversation\u2019s common ground at given point; then a speaker may\nfelicitously utter a sentence such as \u2018The present King of\nSingapore is wise,\u2019 or \u2018Singapore\u2019s king is\nsleeping\u2019. Other parameters characterizing a conversation at a\ngiven point include the domain of discourse, a set of salient\nperceptible objects, standards of precision, time, world or situation,\nspeaker, and addressee. The set of all values for these items at a\ngiven conversational moment is often referred to as\n\u201cconversational score\u201d.\n\n\u201cScorekeeping\u201d approaches to language use typically\nconstrue a contribution to a conversation as a Proposition: If that\n\u201cassertion\u201d is accepted, then the score is updated by\nhaving the Proposition entered into common ground. In this spirit,\nMacFarlane (2011) considers an account of the speech act of assertion\nin terms an utterance\u2019s capacity to update conversational score. Such\nan approach will, however, face a difficulty in explaining how two\nspeech acts with the same content, such as an assertion that the Milky\nWay contains a black hole, and a conjecture that it does, will make\ndifferent conversational contributions. An enrichment of the\nscorekeeping model would include sensitivity to differences such as\nthese.\n\nAnother development in the scorekeeping model refines the teleological\npicture adumbrated above to incorporate Questions, construed (along\nthe lines of Section 2.1) as sets of Propositions. When an\ninterlocutor proffers an assertion that is not met with objections by\nothers in the conversation, the Propositional content of that\nillocution will enter into common ground. When an interlocutor poses a\nquestion that is accepted by others, we may represent the change as an\naddition to Common Ground of the set of propositions that is the\nInterrogative content of that illocution. The presence of that\nInterrogative obliges interlocutors to work to rule all but one\nProposition that is a complete answer to the Interrogative. Because\nInterrogatives stand in inferential relations to one another (Q1\nentails Q2 just in case any answer to Q1 is an answer to Q2), one\nstrategy for answering a question is to divide it into tractable\nquestions that it entails: \u2018How many covered bridges are there\nin Japan?\u2019 can be answered by answering that question for each\nof that country\u2019s 47 prefectures. Roberts (2004, 2012) develops\nthe Question Under Discussion model of conversational dynamics\naccording to which common ground contains a partially ordered set of\nInterrogatives in addition to a set of Propositions. This teleological\napproach to conversation bids fair to enrich our understanding of the\nrelations of speech acts to other central topics within pragmatics\nsuch as presupposition and \nimplicature.[18]\n7. Force-Indicators and the Logically Perfect Language\n\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879) constitutes history\u2019s first\nthoroughgoing attempt to formulate a rigorous formal system in which\nto carry out deductive reasoning. However, Frege did not see his\nBegriffsschrift as merely a tool for assessing the validity of\narguments. Rather, he appears to have seen it as an organon for the\nacquisition of knowledge from unquestionable first principles; in\naddition he wanted to use it in order to help make clear the epistemic\nfoundations on which our knowledge rests.  To this end his formal\nsystem contains not only symbols indicating the content of\npropositions (including logical constants), but also symbols\nindicating the force with which they are put forth. In particular,\nFrege insists that when using his formal system to acquire new\nknowledge from propositions already known, we use an assertion sign to\nindicate our acknowledgment of the truth of the proposition used as\naxioms or inferred therefrom. Frege thus employs what would now be\ncalled a force indicator: an expression whose use indicates\nthe force with which an associated proposition is being put forth\n(Green 2002).\n\nReichenbach expands upon Frege\u2019s idea in his 1947. In addition to\nusing an assertion sign, Reichenbach also uses indicators of\ninterrogative and imperatival force. Hare similarly introduces force\nindicators to lay bare the way in which ethical and cognate utterances\nare made (Hare 1970). Davidson (1979), however, challenges the value\nof this entire enterprise of introducing force-indicating devices into\nlanguages, formal or otherwise. Davidson\u2019s reason is that since\nnatural language already contains many devices for indicating the\nforce of one\u2019s speech act, the only interest a force indicator could\nhave would be if it could guarantee the force of one\u2019s speech act. But\nnothing could do this: Any device purporting to be, say, an infallible\nindicator of assertoric force is liable to being used by a joker or\nactor to heighten the realism of their performance. Referring to the\nputative force-indicating device as a \u2018strengthened mood,\u2019\nhe writes,\n\nIt is apparent that merely speaking the sentence in the strengthened\nmood cannot be counted on to result in an assertion: every joker,\nstoryteller, and actor will immediately take advantage of the\nstrengthened mood to simulate assertion. There is no point, then, in\nthe strengthened mood; the available indicative does as well as\nlanguage can do in the service of assertion (Davidson 1979, p. 311).\n\n Hare 1989 replies that there could be a society with a convention that utterance\nof a certain expression constituted performance of a certain\nillocutionary act, even those utterances that occur on stage or as\nused by jokers or storytellers. Green 1997 questions the relevance of this observation to asserting, which as we have seen, which as we have\nseen, seem to require intentions for their performance. Just as no\nconvention could make it the case that I believe that P, so\ntoo no convention could make it the case that I intend to put forth a\ncertain sentence as an assertion.\n\nOn the other hand, Green 1997 and Green 2000 also observe that even if\nthere can be no force indicator in the sense Davidson criticizes,\nnothing prevents natural language from containing devices that\nindicate force conditional upon one\u2019s performing a speech act: such a\nforce indicator would not show whether one is performing a\nspeech act, but, given that one is doing so, it would\nshow which speech act one is performing. For instance,\nparenthetical expressions such as, \u2018as is the case\u2019 can\noccur in the antecedent of conditionals, as in: \u2018If, as is the\ncase, the globe is warming, then Antarctica will melt.\u2019 Use of\nthe parenthetical cannot guarantee that the sentence or any part of it\nis being asserted, but if the entire sentence is being asserted, then,\nGreen claims, use of the parenthetical guarantees that the speaker is\nalso committed to the content of the antecedent. If this claim is\ncorrect, natural language already contains force indicators in this\nqualified sense. Whether it is worth introducing such force indicators\ninto a logical notation remains an open question.\nSubsequent to Austin\u2019s introduction of the notion of a\nperformative, it has also been suggested that what we might call\nperformative sentential frames behave like force indicators: \u2018I\nclaim that it is sunny,\u2019 seems to be a prolix way of saying that\nit is sunny, where the \u2018I claim\u2019 seems only to indicate\nhow what follows is to be taken. On the approach of Urmson (1952), for\ninstance, such a sentence should be understood on the model of\n\u2018It is sunny, I claim.\u2019 Support for such an analysis may\nbe found in the fact that a potential reply to that\nutterance is \u2018No it isn\u2019t; it\u2019s pouring\noutside!\u2019, while \u2018No you don\u2019t\u2019 is not. Again, if the speaker does not believe it is sunny outside, she cannot dodge, she cannot dodge\nthe accusation of lying by remarking that what she had asserted was\nthat she claimed that it is sunny, and not anything about the\nweather.\n\n\nNonetheless, drawing on Cohen 1964, Lycan 2018 objects to the view\nthat such performative frames make no contribution to sentence or\nutterance meaning. If Marissa felicitously utters, \u2018I claim that\nit is sunny,\u2019 while Abdul felicitously utters, \u2018I\nconjecture that it is sunny,\u2019 the view implies that their\nutterances mean the same. The two speakers have clearly said different\nthings, however. On the other hand, if we hold that the performative\nframe does contribute to the content of what Marissa and Abdul said,\nthen, Lycan points out, it will be difficult to explain how their\nutterances commit either of them to any position about the weather. It\nevidently won\u2019t do to posit inference rules such as \u2018I state\nthat p,\u2018 ergo, \u2018p\u2019. We will\nconsider a solution to what Lycan terms \u201cCohen\u2019s Problem\u201d\nafter developing a notion of illocutionary inference in the next\nsection.\n8. Do Speech Acts Have a Logic?\n\nStudents of speech acts contend, as we have seen, that the unit of\ncommunicative significance is the Illocution rather than the\nProposition. This attitude prompts the question whether logic itself\nmight be enriched by incorporating inferential relations among speech\nacts rather than just inferential relations among Propositions.\nJust as two event-types E1 and E2 (such as running\nquickly and running) could be logically related to one another in that\nit is not possible for one to occur without the other; so too speech\nact types S1 and S2 could be\ninferentially related to one another if it is not possible to perform\none without performing the other. A warning that the bull is about to\ncharge is also an assertion that the bull is about to charge but the\nconverse is not true. This is in spite of the fact that these two\nspeech acts have the same propositional content: That the bull is\nabout to charge. If, therefore, warning implies asserting but not vice\nversa, then that inferential relation is not to be caught within the\nnet of inferential relations among propositions.\n\nIn their Foundations of Illocutionary Logic (1985), Searle\nand Vanderveken attempt a general treatment of logical relations among\nspeech acts.  They describe their central question in terms of\ncommitment:\n\nA theory of illocutionary logic of the sort we are describing is\nessentially a theory of illocutionary commitment as determined by\nillocutionary force. The single most important question it must answer\nis this: Given that a speaker in a certain context of utterance\nperforms a successful illocutionary act of a certain form, what other\nillocutions does the performance of that act commit him to? (1985,\np. 6)\n\nTo explicate their notion of illocutionary commitment, these\nauthors invoke their definition of illocutionary force in terms of the\nseven values mentioned in Section 2.3 above. On the basis of this\ndefinition, they define two notions pertinent to entailment relations\namong speech acts, namely strong illocutionary commitment\nand weak illocutionary commitment. According to the former\ndefinition, an illocutionary act S1 commits a\nspeaker to another illocutionary act S2 iff it is\nnot possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2. Whether that relation holds between\na pair of illocutionary acts depends on the particular septuples with\nwhich they are identified. Thus suppose that S1 is\nidentical with <IP1, Str1, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep 1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1> (corresponding to illocutionary point,\nstrength, mode of achievement, propositional content, preparatory\ncondition, sincerity condition, and strength of sincerity condition,\nrespectively); and suppose that S2 is identical\nwith <IP1, Str2, Mode1,\nCont1, Prep1, Sinc1,\nStresinc1>. Suppose further that Str1 and\nStr2 differ only in that 1 is stronger than 2. Then it will\nnot be possible to perform S1 without\nperforming S2; whence the former strongly\nillocutionarily implies the latter. (This definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment generalizes in a straightforward way to the\ncase in which a set of speech acts S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121 implies a speech\nact Sn.)\n\nSearle and Vanderveken also define a notion of weak illocutionary\ncommitment such that S1 weakly illocutionarily\nimplies S2 iff every performance\nof S1 commits an agent to meeting the conditions\nlaid down in the septuple identical to S2 (1985,\np. 24). Searle and Vanderveken infer that this implies that\nif P logically entails Q, and an agent\nasserts P, then she is committed to believing\nthat Q. These authors stress, however, that this does not\nmean that the agent who asserts P is committed\nto cultivating the belief Q when P\nimplies Q. In lieu of that explication, however, it is\nunclear just what notion of commitment is at issue. It is unclear, for\ninstance, what it could mean to be committed to believing Q\n(rather than just being committed to Q) if this is not to be\nexplicated as being committed to cultivating the belief\nthat Q.\n\nOther approaches attempt to circumvent such problems by reductively\ndefining the notion of commitment in terms of obligations to action\nand liability to error and/or vindication. Performance of a speech act\nor set of speech acts can commit an agent to a distinct content, and\ndo so relative to some force. If P and Q jointly\nimply R, then my asserting both P and Q\ncommits me to R. That is not to say that I have also\nasserted R: if assertion were closed under deductive\nconsequence I would assert infinitely many things just by virtue of\nasserting one. By contrast, if I conjecture P and Q,\nthen I am once again committed to R but not in the way that I\nwould have been had I asserted P and Q. For\ninstance, in the assertion case, once my further commitment to R is\nmade clear, it is within the rights of my addressee to ask how I know\nthat R holds; this would not have been an acceptable reply to my\nmerely conjecturing P and Q. Developing this theme,\nlet S be an arbitrary speaker,\n<\u0394lAl,\n\u2026, \u0394nAn,\n\u0394B> a sequence of force/content pairs; then:\n\n<\u0394lAl, \u2026,\n\u0394nAn, \u0394B>\nis illocutionarily valid iff if speaker S is\ncommitted to each Ai under mode\n\u0394i, then S is committed\nto B under mode\n \u0394.[19]\n\nBecause it concerns what force/content pairs commit an agent to\nwhat others, illocutionary validity is an essentially deontic notion:\nIt will be cashed out in terms either of obligation to use a content\nin a certain way conversationally, or liability to error or\nvindication depending upon how the world is.\n\nOur discussion of the possibility of an illocutionary logic answers\none question posed at the end of Section 6.3, namely whether it is\npossible to perform a speech act without intending to do so. This\nseems likely given Searle and Vanderveken\u2019s definition of strong\nillocutionary commitment: We need only imagine an agent performing\nsome large number of speech acts, S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121, which, unbeknownst to\nher, jointly guarantee that she fulfills the seven conditions defining\nanother speech act Sn. Even in such a case she\nperforms Sn only by virtue of intentionally\nperforming some other set of speech acts S1,\n\u2026, Sn\u22121; it is difficult to see\nhow one can perform Sn while having no intention\nof performing a speech act at all.\n\nWe are also in a position to make headway on Cohen\u2019s Problem as\nformulated by Lycan. As argued in Green 2000, in an assertion of\n\u2018I (hereby) assert that p\u2019, a speaker commits\nherself to p even though her words do not logically entail that\nProposition; nor do they presuppose, or either conversationally or\nconventionally imply it. They do, however, illocutionarily entail it:\nanyone committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019\nassertorically is thereby committed to p assertorically. By\ncontrast, one committed to \u2018I assert that p\u2019 as a\nsupposition for the sake of argument is not thereby committed\nto p. Accordingly, such a phrase as \u2018I assert that\u2019\nis semantically opaque (making a non-trivial contribution to the truth\nconditions of the sentences in which it occurs) but pragmatically\ntransparent in the sense that a speaker who undertakes assertoric\ncommitment to a sentence in which it has widest scope is also\nassertorically committed to its complement. Analogous remarks apply to\n\u2018I conjecture that\u2019 and the like.\n9. Speech Acts and Social Issues\n\nIn a paradigmatic illocutionary event, a speaker has a choice of which\nif any speech act to perform and her addressee will do her charitable\nbest to discern that speaker\u2019s intentions and, where necessary, which\nconventions she may be invoking. Pratt (1986) observes that this\nparadigm is not true to the facts of many areas of communicative\nlife, writing\n\nAn account of linguistic interaction based on the idea of exchange\nglosses over the very basic facts that, to put it crudely, some people\nget to do more talking than others, some are supposed to do more\nlistening, and not everybody\u2019s words are worth the same. (1986, p. 68)\n\n Although Pratt intends this remark as a critique of speech act\ntheory, it also suggests a way in which this theory might shed light\non subtle forms of oppression. We saw in Section 2.2 that a putative\nbet can misfire if it is not accepted. In such a case the speaker\nattempts to bet but fails in that effort due to a lack of audience\nuptake. So too, a person may not be in the correct social position to, say, excommunicate or appoint, and her attempts to perform such illocutions will misfire. More momentously, a pattern of abuses\nof speech act institutions might deprive a person of an ability to\nperform speech acts: the inveterate promise-breaker will, in time, lead others\nin his community to be unwilling to accept any promises he tries to\nmake. He can perform countless locutionary acts but will be unable to\nperform the illocutionary act of promising, at least in this\ncommunity.\n\nA pattern of culpable behavior could make a speaker unable to perform one speech act type. Could a pattern of culpable\nbehavior\u2013intentional or inadvertent\u2014on the part of others\nin a speaker\u2019s community achieve the same effect? This could happen if enough such speakers decide never\nto accept one person\u2019s bets, warnings, or promises. Beyond such\nhypothetical cases, it has been argued that patterns of social\ninequality can prevent members of certain groups from performing the speech acts they would choose to. Building on and refining\nMcKinnon\u2019s (1993) claim that pornography silences women, Langton\n(1993), and Hornsby and Langton (1998) argue that the industry and\nconsumption of pornography deprive women of the ability to perform the\nspeech act of refusing sexual advances. Refusing is a speech act, but\nif large enough numbers of men deny uptake (with such thoughts as,\n\u201cBy \u2018no\u2019 she really means \u2018yes\u2019,\u201d\netc.) then, these authors argue, women\u2019s attempts to refuse sexual\nadvances will be characteristically inert with respect to the speech\nact of refusal. Women will still be able to attempt to refuse sexual\nadvances, and can still try to prevent them by physical means, but a\ncrucial illocutionary form of protection will be closed to them. So\ntoo, apartheid, Jim Crow, and even patterns of discrimination of which\nthe perpetrators are not consciously aware, can deprive racial,\nreligious, and ethnic minority groups of the ability to perform\nspeech-act types requiring uptake. These phenomena are generally\nreferred to as illocutionary silencing.\n\nBird (2002) denies that the speech act of refusal requires\nuptake. Such an illocution is, he contends, like inviting and\nsurrendering, which can occur whether or not their intended audiences\ngrasp or accept the proffered illocutions. Similarly denying that the\n\u201csilencing\u201d argument should be cast in terms of speech\nacts, Maitra 2009 argues that the institution of pornography prevents\nspeaker-meant instances of refusal from being understood. One can\nspeaker-mean that she refuses, for instance, but patterns of cognitive\nand affective response will systematically prevent that refusal from\nbeing grasped. Broadening the scope of investigations of the\ninteraction of injustice and illocutionary phenomena, McGowan 2009\nargues that some speech acts can not only cause but also constitute\ninstances of oppression. Anderson, Haslanger and Langton (2012) provide overviews of research on racial, gender\nand related forms of oppression as they relate to speech acts. \n\n\nAlthough not inherently culpable, the practice of dogwhistling has\nalso recently gained the interest of theorists of speech acts. As\nsuggested by the metaphor, an agent dogwhistles just in case one or\nmore dimensions of a speech act she performs is readily intelligible\nonly to a proper subset of her addressees. Saul 2018 notes that in\ncontemporary American politics, stating one\u2019s opposition to the\nSupreme Court case of Dred Scott seems to be a way of signaling one\u2019s\nanti-abortion sympathies. For those not in the know, however, a\nspeaker\u2019s opposition to the Dred Scott appears to be an\nuncontroversial act of rejecting racism. The phenomenon of\ndogwhistling provides an apparent challenge to conceptions of speaker\nmeaning in terms of overtness, since the dogwhistler would seem to\nspeaker mean a content that is cryptic to all but her insider\naudience: is her utterance both overt and covert? Instead of adopting\nsuch a view, one who construes speech acts in terms of overtness could\nrefine the notion of manifestness occuring in her account. What is\nmanifest to one addressee may not be manifest to another, and a\nspeaker may exploit this fact. Accordingly, someone who avows, \u201cI\u2019m\nagainst Dred Scott,\u201d may speaker-mean that she is both against Dred\nScott and pro-life to one part of her audience, but only that she is\nagainst Dred Scott to another part.",
