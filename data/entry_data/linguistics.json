    "preamble": "\n\nPhilosophy of linguistics is the philosophy of science as applied to\nlinguistics. This differentiates it sharply from the philosophy of\nlanguage, traditionally concerned with matters of meaning and\nreference.\n\nAs with the philosophy of other special sciences, there are general\ntopics relating to matters like methodology and explanation (e.g., the\nstatus of statistical explanations in psychology and sociology, or the\nphysics-chemistry relation in philosophy of chemistry), and more\nspecific philosophical issues that come up in the special science at\nissue (simultaneity for philosophy of physics; individuation of\nspecies and ecosystems for the philosophy of biology). General topics\nof the first type in the philosophy of linguistics include:\n\nWhat the subject matter is,\nWhat the theoretical goals are,\nWhat form theories should take, and\nWhat counts as data.\n\n\nSpecific topics include issues in language learnability, language\nchange, the competence-performance distinction, and the expressive\npower of linguistic theories.\n\nThere are also topics that fall on the borderline between philosophy\nof language and philosophy of linguistics: of \u201clinguistic\nrelativity\u201d (see the supplement on the linguistic relativity\nhypothesis in the Summer 2015 archived version of the entry on\n relativism),\n language vs.\n idiolect,\n speech acts (including the distinction between locutionary,\nillocutionary, and perlocutionary acts), the language of thought,\nimplicature, and the semantics of mental states (see the entries on\n analysis,\n semantic compositionality,\n mental representation,\n pragmatics, and\n defaults in semantics and pragmatics).\n In these cases it is often the kind of answer given and not the\ninherent nature of the topic itself that determines the\nclassification. Topics that we consider to be more in the philosophy\nof language than the philosophy of linguistics include intensional\ncontexts, direct reference, and empty names (see the entries on\n propositional attitude reports,\n intensional logic,\n rigid designators,\n reference, and\n descriptions).\n\nThis entry does not aim to provide a general introduction to\nlinguistics for philosophers; readers seeking that should consult a\nsuitable textbook such as Akmajian et al. (2010) or Napoli (1996). For\na general history of Western linguistic thought, including recent\ntheoretical linguistics, see Seuren (1998). Newmeyer (1986) is useful\nadditional reading for post-1950 American linguistics. Tomalin (2006)\ntraces the philosophical, scientific, and linguistic antecedents of\nChomsky\u2019s magnum opus (1955/1956; published 1975), and Scholz\nand Pullum (2007) provide a critical review. Articles that have\nfocused on the philosophical implications of generative linguistics\ninclude Ludlow (2011) and Rey (2020). For recent articles on the\nphilosophy of linguistics more generally, Itkonen (2013) discusses\nvarious aspects of the field from its early Greek beginnings, Pullum\n(2019) details debates that have engaged philosophers from 1945 to\n2015, and Nefdt (2019a) discusses connections with contemporary issues\nin the philosophy of science.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Three Approaches to Linguistic Theorizing: Externalism, Emergentism, and Essentialism\n\nThe issues we discuss have been debated with vigor and sometimes\nvenom. Some of the people involved have had famous exchanges in the\nlinguistics journals, in the popular press, and in public forums. To\nunderstand the sharp disagreements between advocates of the approaches\nit may be useful to have a sketch of the dramatis personae before us,\neven if it is undeniably an oversimplification.\n\nWe see three tendencies or foci, divided by what they take to be the\nsubject matter, the approach they advocate for studying it, and what\nthey count as an explanation. We characterize them roughly in Table\n1.\n\n\n\n\n \nexternalists\nemergentists\nessentialists \n\nPrimary phenomena\nActual utterances as produced by language users\nFacts of social cognition, interaction, and communication\nIntuitions of grammaticality and literal meaning \n\nPrimary subject matter\nLanguage use; structural properties of expressions and\nlanguages\nLinguistic communication, cognition, variation, and change\nAbstract universal principles that explain the properties of\nspecific languages \n\nAim\nTo describe attested expression structure and interrelations,\nand predicting properties of unattested expressions\nTo explain structural properties of languages in terms of\ngeneral cognitive mechanisms and communicative functions\nTo articulate universal principles and provide explanations for\ndeep and cross-linguistically constant linguistic properties\n\n\nLinguistic structure\nA system of patterns, inferrable from generally accessible,\nobjective features of language use\nA system of constructions that range from fixed idiomatic\nphrases to highly abstract productive types\nA system of abstract conditions that may not be evident from the\nexperience of typical language users \n\nValues\nAccurate modeling of linguistic form that accords with empirical\ndata and permits prediction concerning unconsidered cases\nCognitive, cultural, historical, and evolutionary explanations\nof phenomena found in linguistic communication systems\nHighly abstract, covering-law explanations for properties of\nlanguage as inferred from linguistic intuitions \n\nChildren\u2019s language\nA nascent form of language, very different from adult linguistic\ncompetence\nA series of stages in an ontogenetic process of developing adult\ncommunicative competence\nVery similar to adult linguistic competence though obscured by\ncognitive, articulatory, and lexical limits \n\nWhat is acquired\nA grasp of the distributional properties of the constituents of\nexpressions of a language\nA mainly conventional and culturally transmitted system for\nlinguistic communication\nAn internalized generative device that characterizes an infinite\nset of expressions  \n\n\nTable 1. Three Approaches to the Study\nof Language\n\n\nA broad and varied range of distinct research projects can be pursued\nwithin any of these approaches; one advocate may be more motivated by\nsome parts of the overall project than others are. So the tendencies\nshould not be taken as sharply honed, well-developed research programs\nor theories. Rather, they provide background biases for the\ndevelopment of specific research programs\u2014biases which sometimes\ndevelop into ideological stances or polemical programs or lead to the\nbranching off of new specialisms with separate journals. In the\njudgment of Phillips (2010), \u201cDialog between adherents of\ndifferent approaches is alarmingly rare.\u201d\n\nThe names we have given these approaches are just mnemonic tags, not\ndescriptions. The Externalists, for example, might well have been\ncalled \u2018structural descriptivists\u2019 instead, since they\ntend to be especially concerned to develop models that can be used to\npredict the structure of natural language expressions. The\nExternalists have long been referred to by Essentialists as\n\u2018empiricists\u2019 (and sometimes Externalists apply that term\nto themselves), though this is misleading (see Scholz and Pullum 2006:\n60\u201363): the \u2018empiricist\u2019 tag comes with an\naccusation of denying the role of learning biases in language\nacquisition (see Matthews 1984, Laurence and Margolis 2001), but that\nis no part of the Externalists\u2019 creed (see e.g. Elman 1993,\nLappin and Shieber 2007).\n\nEmergentists are also sometimes referred to by Essentialists as\n\u2018empiricists\u2019, but they either use the Emergentist label\nfor themselves (Bates et al. 1998, O\u2019Grady 2008, MacWhinney\n2005) or call themselves \u2018usage-based\u2019 linguists (Barlow\nand Kemmer 2002, Tomasello 2003) or \u2018construction\ngrammarians\u2019 (Goldberg 1995, Croft 2001). Newmeyer (1991), like\nTomasello, refers to the Essentialists as \u2018formalists\u2019,\nbecause of their tendency to employ abstractions, and to use tools\nfrom mathematics and logic.\n\nDespite these terminological inconsistencies, we can look at what\ntypical members of each approach would say about their vision of\nlinguistic science, and what they say about the alternatives. Many of\nthe central differences between these approaches depend on what\nproponents consider to be the main project of linguistic theorizing,\nand what they count as a satisfying explanation.\n\nMany researchers\u2014perhaps most\u2014mix elements from each of\nthe three approaches. For example, if Emergentists are to explain the\nsyntactic structure of expressions by appeal to facts about the nature\nof the use of symbols in human communication, then they will\npresuppose a great deal of Externalist work in describing linguistic\npatterns, and those Externalists who work on computational parsing\nsystems frequently use (at least as a starting point) rule systems and\n\u2018structural\u2019 patterns worked out by Essentialists.\nCertainly, there are no logical impediments for a researcher with one\ntendency from simultaneously pursuing another; these approaches are\nonly general centers of emphasis.\n1.1 The Externalists\n\nIf one assumes, with the Externalists, that the main goal of a\nlinguistic theory is to develop accurate models of the structural\nproperties of the speech sounds, words, phrases, and other linguistic\nitems, then the clearly privileged information will include corpora\n(written and oral)\u2014bodies of attested and recorded language use\n(suitably idealized). The goal is to describe how this public record\nexhibits certain (perhaps non-phenomenal) patterns that are\nprojectable.\n\nAmerican structural linguistics of the 1920s to 1950s championed the\ndevelopment of techniques for using corpora as a basis for developing\nstructural descriptions of natural languages, although such work was\nreally not practically possible until the wide-spread availability of\ncheap, powerful, and fast computers. Andr\u00e9 Martinet (1960: 1)\nnotes that one of the basic assumptions of structuralist approaches to\nlinguistics is that \u201cnothing may be called\n\u2018linguistic\u2019 that is not manifest or manifested one way or\nanother between the mouth of the speaker and the ears of the\nlistener\u201d. He is, however, quick to point out that \u201cthis\nassumption does not entail that linguists should restrict their field\nof research to the audible part of the communication\nprocess\u2014speech can only be interpreted as such, and not as so\nmuch noise, because it stands for something else that is not\nspeech.\u201d\n\nAmerican structuralists\u2014Leonard Bloomfield in\nparticular\u2014were attacked, sometimes legitimately and sometimes\nillegitimately, by certain factions in the Essentialist tradition. For\nexample, it was perhaps justifiable to criticize Bloomfield for\nadopting a nominalist ontology as popularized by the logical\nempiricists. But he was later attacked by Essentialists for holding\nanti-mentalist views about linguistics, when it is arguable that his\nactual view was that the science of linguistics should not commit\nitself to any particular psychological theory. (He had earlier been an\nenthusiast for the mentalist and introspectionist psychology of\nWilhelm Wundt; see Bloomfield 1914.)\n\nExternalism continues to thrive within computational linguistics,\nwhere the American structuralist vison of studying language through\nautomatic analysis of corpora has enjoyed a recrudescence, and very\nlarge, computationally searchable corpora are being used to test\nhypotheses about the structure of languages (see Sampson 2001, chapter\n1, for discussion).\n1.2 The Emergentists\n\nEmergentists aim to explain the capacity for language in terms of\nnon-linguistic human capacities: thinking, communicating, and\ninteracting. Edward Sapir expressed a characteristic Emergentist theme\nwhen he wrote:\n\nLanguage is primarily a cultural or social product and must be\nunderstood as such\u2026 It is peculiarly important that linguists,\nwho are often accused, and accused justly, of failure to look beyond\nthe pretty patterns of their subject matter, should become aware of\nwhat their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in\ngeneral. (Sapir 1929: 214)\n\n\nThe \u201cpretty patterns\u201d derided here are characteristic of\nstructuralist analyses. Sociolinguistics, which is much closer in\nspirit to Sapir\u2019s project, studies the influence of social and\nlinguistic structure on each other. One particularly influential\nstudy, Labov (1966), examines the influence of social class on\nlanguage variation. Other sociolinguists examine the relation between\nstatus within a group on linguistic innovation (Eckert 1989). This\ninterest in variation within languages is characteristic of\nEmergentist approaches to the study of language.\n\nAnother kind of Emergentist, like Tomasello (2003), will stress the\nrole of theory of mind and the capacity to use symbols to change\nconspecifics\u2019 mental states as uniquely human preadaptations for\nlanguage acquisition, use, and invention. MacWhinney (2005) aims to\nexplain linguistic phenomena (such as phrase structure and constraints\non long distance dependencies) in terms of the way conversation\nfacilitates accurate information-tracking and\nperspective-switching.\n\nFunctionalist research programs generally fall within the broad\ntendency to approach the study of language as an Emergentist.\nAccording to one proponent:\n\nThe functionalist view of language [is] as a system of communicative\nsocial interaction\u2026 Syntax is not radically arbitrary, in this\nview, but rather is relatively motivated by semantic,\npragmatic, and cognitive concerns. (Van Valin 1991, quoted in Newmeyer\n1991: 4; emphasis in original)\n\n\nAnd according to Russ Tomlin, a linguist who takes a functionalist\napproach:\n\nSyntax is not autonomous from semantics or pragmatics\u2026the\nrejection of autonomy derives from the observation that the use of\nparticular grammatical forms is strongly linked, even\ndeterministically linked, to the presence of particular semantic or\npragmatic functions in discourse. (Tomlin 1990, quoted by Newmeyer\n(1991): 4)\n\n\nThe idea that linguistic form is autonomous, and more specifically\nthat syntactic form (rather than, say, phonological form) is\nautonomous, is a characteristic theme of the Essentialists. And the\nclaims of Van Valin and Tomlin to the effect that syntax is\nnot independent of semantics and pragmatics might tempt some\nto think that Emergentism and Essentialism are logically incompatible.\nBut this would be a mistake, since there are a large number of\nnonequivalent autonomy of form theses.\n\nEven in the context of trying to explain what the autonomy thesis is,\nNewmeyer (1991: 3) talks about five formulations of the thesis, each\nof which can be found in some Essentialists\u2019 writings, without\n(apparently) realizing that they are non-equivalent. One is the\nrelatively strong claim that the central properties of linguistic form\nmust not be defined with essential reference to\n\u201cconcepts outside the system\u201d, which suggests that no\nprimitives in linguistics could be defined in psychological or\nbiological terms. Another takes autonomy of form to be a\nnormative claim: that linguistic concepts ought not\nto be defined or characterized in terms of non-linguistic concepts.\nThe third and fourth versions are ontological: one denies that central\nlinguistic concepts should be ontologically reduced to\nnon-linguistic ones, and the other denies that they can be.\nAnd in the fifth version the autonomy of syntax is taken to deny that\nsyntactic patterning can be explained in terms of meaning or\ndiscourse functions.\n\nFor each of these versions of autonomy, there are Essentialists who\nagree with it. Probably the paradigmatic Essentialist agrees with them\nall. But Emergentists need not disagree with them all. Paradigmatic\nfunctionalists like Tomlin, Van Valin and MacWhinney could in\nprinciple hold that the explanation of syntactic form, for example,\nwill ultimately be in terms of discourse functions and semantics, but\nstill accept that syntactic categories cannot be reduced to\nnon-linguistic ones.\n1.3 The Essentialists\n\nIf Leonard Bloomfield is the intellectual ancestor of Externalism, and\nSapir the father of Emergentism, then Noam Chomsky is the intellectual\nancestor of Essentialism. The researcher with predominantly\nEssentialist inclinations aims to identify the intrinsic properties of\nlanguage that make it what it is. For a huge majority of practitioners\nof this approach\u2014researchers in the tradition of\ngenerative grammar associated with Chomsky\u2014this\nmeans postulating universals of human linguistic structure, unlearned\nbut tacitly known, that permit and assist children to acquire human\nlanguages. This generative Essentialism has a preference for finding\nsurprising characteristics of languages that cannot be inferred from\nthe data of usage, and are not predictable from human cognition or the\nrequirements of communication.\n\nRather than being impressed with language variation, as are\nEmergentists and many Externalists, the generative Essentialists are\nextremely impressed with the idea that very young children of almost\nany intelligence level, and just about any social upbringing, acquire\nlanguage to the same high degree of mastery. From this it is inferred\nthat there must be unlearned features shared by all languages that\nsomehow assist in language acquisition.\n\nA large number of contemporary Essentialists who follow\nChomsky\u2019s teaching on this matter claim that semantics and\npragmatics are not a central part of the study of language. In\nChomsky\u2019s view, \u201cit is possible that natural language has\nonly syntax and pragmatics\u201d (Chomsky 1995: 26); that is, only\n\u201cinternalist computations and performance systems that access\nthem\u201d; semantic theories are merely \u201cpart of an interface\nlevel\u201d or \u201ca form of syntax\u201d (Chomsky 1992:\n223).\n\nThus, while Bloomfield understood it to be a sensible practical\ndecision to assign semantics to some field other than linguistics\nbecause of the underdeveloped state of semantic research, Chomsky\nappears to think that semantics as standardly understood is not part\nof the essence of the language faculty at all. (In broad outline, this\nexclusion of semantics from linguistics comports with Sapir\u2019s\nview that form is linguistic but content is cultural.)\n\nAlthough Chomsky is an Essentialist in his approach to the study of\nlanguage, excluding semantics as a central part of linguistic theory\nclearly does not follow from linguistic Essentialism (Katz 1980\nprovides a detailed discussion of Chomsky\u2019s views on semantics).\nToday there are many Essentialists who do hold that semantics\nis a component of a full linguistic theory.\n\nFor example, many linguists today are interested in the\nsyntax-semantics interface\u2014the relationship between the surface\nsyntactic structure of sentences and their semantic interpretation.\nThis area of interest is generally quite alien to philosophers who are\nprimarily concerned with semantics only, and it falls outside of\nChomsky\u2019s syntactocentric purview as well. Linguists who work in\nthe kind of semantics initiated by Montague (1974) certainly focus on\nthe essential features of language (most of their findings appear to\nbe of universal import rather than limited to the semantic rules of\nspecific languages). Useful works to consult to get a sense of the\nmodern style of investigation of the syntax-semantics interface would\ninclude Partee (1975), Jacobson (1996), Szabolcsi (1997), Chierchia\n(1998), Steedman (2000).\n1.4 Comparing the three approaches\n\nThe discussion so far has been at a rather high level of abstraction.\nIt may be useful to contrast the three tendencies by looking at how\nthey each would analyze a particular linguistic phenomenon. We have\nselected the syntax of double-object clauses like\nHand the guard your pass (also called\nditransitive clauses), in which the verb is\nimmediately followed by a sequence of two noun phrases, the first\ntypically denoting a recipient and the second something transferred.\nFor many such clauses there is an alternative way of expressing\nroughly the same thing: for Hand the guard your pass there is\nthe alternative Hand your pass to the guard, in which the\nverb is followed by a single object noun phrase and the recipient is\nexpressed after that by a preposition phrase with to. We will\ncall these recipient-PP clauses.\n1.4.1 A typical Essentialist analysis\n\nLarson (1988) offers a generative Essentialist approach to the syntax\nof double-object clauses. In order to provide even a rough outline of\nhis proposals, it will be very useful to be able to use tree\ndiagrams of syntactic structure. A tree is a mathematical\nobject consisting of a set of points called nodes\nbetween which certain relations hold. The nodes correspond to\nsyntactic units; left-right order on the page corresponds to temporal\norder of utterance between them; and upward connecting lines represent\nthe relation \u2018is an immediate subpart of\u2019. Nodes are\nlabeled to show categories of phrases and words, such as noun phrase\n(NP); preposition phrase (PP); and verb phrase (VP). When the internal\nstructure of some subpart of a tree is basically unimportant to the\ntopic under discussion, it is customary to mask that part with an\nempty triangle. Consider a simple example: an active transitive clause\nlike (Ai) and its passive equivalent (Aii).\n\n(A)\n\n\ni.\nThe guard checked my pass. [active clause]\nii.\nMy pass was checked by the guard. [passive\nclause]\n \n\n\nA tree structure for (Ai) is shown in (T1).\n\n\n\n\nIn analyses of the sort Larson exemplifies, the structure of an\nexpression is given by a derivation, which consists\nof a sequence of successively modified trees. Larson calls the\nearliest ones underlying structures. The last (and\nleast abstract) in the derivation is the surface structure, which\ncaptures properties relevant to the way the expression is written and\npronounced. The underlying structures are posited in order to better\nidentify syntactic generalizations. They are related to surface\nstructures by a series of operations called\ntransformations (which generative Essentialists\ntypically regard as mentally real operations of the human language\nfaculty).\n\nOne of the fundamental operations that a transformation can effect is\nmovement, which involves shifting a part of the\nsyntactic structure of a tree to another location within it. For\nexample, it is often claimed that passive clauses have very much the\nsame kinds of underlying structures as the synonymous active clauses,\nand thus a passive clause like (Aii) would have an underlying\nstructure much like (T1). A movement transformation would shift\nthe guard toward the end of the clause (and add by),\nand another would shift my pass into the position before the\nverb. In other words, passive clauses look much more like their active\ncounterparts in underlying structure.\n\nIn a similar way, Larson proposes that a double-object clause like\n(B.ii) has the same underlying structure as (B.i).\n\n(B)\n\n\ni.\nI showed my pass to the guard. [recipient-PP]\nii.\nI showed the guard my pass. [double object]\n \n\n\nMoreover, he proposes that the transformational operation of deriving\nthe surface structure of (B.ii) from the underlying structure of (B.i)\nis essentially the same as the one that derives the surface structure\nof (A.ii) from the underlying structure of (A.i).\n\nLarson adopts many assumptions from Chomsky (1981) and subsequent\nwork. One is that all NPs have to be assigned Case in\nthe course of a derivation. (Case is an abstract syntactic property,\nonly indirectly related to the morphological case forms displayed by\nnominative, accusative, and genitive pronouns. Objective Case is\nassumed to be assigned to any NP in direct object position, e.g.,\nmy pass in (T1), and Nominative Case is assigned to an NP in\nthe subject position of a tensed clause, e.g., the guard in\n(T1).)\n\nHe also makes two specific assumptions about the derivation of passive\nclauses. First, Case assignment to the position immediately after the\nverb is \u201csuppressed\u201d, which entails that the NP there will\nnot get Case unless it moves to some other position. (The subject\nposition is the obvious one, because there it will receive Nominative\nCase.) Second, there is an unusual assignment of semantic role to NPs:\ninstead of the subject NP being identified as the agent of the action\nthe clause describes, that role is assigned to an adjunct at the end\nof the VP (the by-phrase in (A.ii); an adjunct is a\nconstituent with an optional modifying role in its clause rather than\na grammatically obligatory one like subject or object).\n\nLarson proposes that both of these points about passive clauses have\nanalogs in the structure of double-object VPs. First, Case assignment\nto the position immediately after the verb is suppressed; and since\nLarson takes the preposition to to be the marker of Case, this means\nin effect that to disappears. This entails that the NP after\nto will not get Case unless it moves to some other position.\nSecond, there is an unusual assignment of semantic role to NPs:\ninstead of the direct object NP being identified as the entity\naffected by the action the clause describes, that role is assigned to\nan adjunct at the end of the VP.\n\nLarson makes some innovative assumptions about VPs. First, he proposes\nthat in the underlying structure of a double-object clause the\ndirect object precedes the verb, the tree diagram being (T2).\n\n\n\n\nThis does not match the surface order of words (showed my pass to\nthe guard), but it is not intended to: it is an underlying\nstructure. A transformation will move the verb to the left of my\npass to produce the surface order seen in (B.i).\n\nSecond, he assumes that there are two nodes labeled VP in a\ndouble-object clause, and two more labeled V\u2032, though there is\nonly one word of the verb (V) category. (Only the smaller VP and\nV\u2032 are shown in the partial structure (T2).)\n\nWhat is important here is that (T2) is the basis for the double-object\nsurface structure as well. To produce that, the preposition\nto is erased and an additional NP position (for my\npass) is attached to the V\u2032, thus:\n\n\n\n\nThe additional NP is assigned the affected-entity semantic role. The\nother NP (the guard) does not yet have Case; but Larson\nassumes that it moves into the NP position before the verb. The result\nis shown in (T4), where \u2018e\u2019 marks the empty\nstring left where some words have been moved away:\n\n\n\n\nLarson assumes that in this position the guard can receive\nCase. What remains is for the verb to move into a higher V position\nfurther to its left, to obtain the surface order:\n\n\n\n\nThe complete sequence of transformations is taken to give a deep\ntheoretical explanation of many properties of (B.i) and (B.ii),\nincluding such things as what could be substituted for the two NPs,\nand the fact there is at least rough truth-conditional equivalence\nbetween the two clauses.\n\nThe reader with no previous experience of generative linguistics will\nhave many questions about the foregoing sketch (e.g., whether it is\nreally necessary to have the guard after showed in\n(T3), then the opposite order in (T4), and finally the same order\nagain in (T5)). We cannot hope to answer such questions here;\nLarson\u2019s paper is extremely rich in further assumptions, links\nto the previous literature, and additional classes of data that he\naims to explain. But the foregoing should suffice to convey some of\nthe flavor of the analysis.\n\nThe key point to note is that Essentialists seek underlying symmetries\nand parallels whose operation is not manifest in the data of language\nuse. For Essentialists, there is positive explanatory virtue in\nhypothesizing abstract structures that are very far from being\ninferrable from performance; and the posited operations on those\nstructures are justified in terms of elegance and formal parallelism\nwith other analyses, not through observation of language use in\ncommunicative situations.\n1.4.2 A typical Emergentist analysis\n\nMany Emergentists are favorably disposed toward the kind of\nconstruction grammar expounded in Goldberg (1995). We\nwill use her work as an exemplar of the Emergentist approach. The\nfirst thing to note is that Goldberg does not take double-object\nclauses like (B.ii) to be derived alternants of recipient-PP\nstructures like (B.i), the way Larson does. So she is not looking for\na regular syntactic operation that can relate their derivations;\nindeed, she does not posit derivations at all. She is interested in\nexplaining correlations between syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic\naspects of clauses; for example, she asks this question:\n\nHow are the semantics of independent constructions related such that\nthe classes of verbs associated with one overlap with the classes of\nverbs associated with another? (Goldberg 1995: 89)\n\n\nThus she aims to explain why some verbs occur in both the\ndouble-object and recipient-PP kinds of expression and some do\nnot.\n\nThe fundamental notion in Goldberg\u2019s linguistic theory is that\nof a construction. A construction can be defined very\nroughly as a way of structurally composing words or phrases\u2014a\nsort of template\u2014for expressing a certain class of meanings.\nLike Emergentists in general, Goldberg regards linguistic theory as\ncontinuous with a certain part of general cognitive psychological\ntheory; linguistics emerges from this more general theory, and\nlinguistic matters are rarely fully separate from cognitive matters.\nSo a construction for Goldberg has a mental reality: it corresponds to\na generalized concept or scenario expressible in a language, annotated\nwith a guide to the linguistic structure of the expression.\n\nMany words will be trivial examples of constructions: a single concept\npaired with a way of pronouncing and some details about grammatical\nrestrictions (category, inflectional class, etc.); but constructions\ncan be much more abstract and internally complex. The double-object\nconstruction, which Goldberg calls the Ditransitive Construction, is a\nmoderately abstract and complex one; she diagrams it thus (p. 50):\n\n\n\n\nThis expresses a set of constraints on how to use English to\ncommunicate the idea of a particular kind of scenario. The scenario\ninvolves a ternary relation CAUSE-RECEIVE holding between an agent\n(agt), a recipient (rec), and a\npatient (pat). PRED is a variable that is filled by\nthe meaning of a particular verb when it is employed in this\nconstruction.\n\nThe solid vertical lines downward from agt and\npat indicate that for any verb integrated into this\nconstruction it is required that its subject NP should express the\nagent participant, and the direct object (OBJ2) should\nexpress the patient participant. The dashed vertical line downward\nfrom rec signals that the first object (OBJ) may express the recipient\nbut it does not have to\u2014the necessity of there being a recipient\nis a property of the construction itself, and not every verb demands\nthat it be made explicit who the recipient is. But if there are two\nobjects, the first is obligatorily associated with the recipient role:\nWe sent the builder a carpenter can only express a claim\nabout the sending of a carpenter over to the builder, never the\nsending of the builder over to where a carpenter is.\n\nWhen a particular verb is used in this construction, it may have\nobligatory accompanying NPs denoting what Goldberg calls\n\u201cprofiled participants\u201d so that the match between the\nparticipant roles (agt, rec,\npat) is one-to-one, as with the verb hand.\nWhen this verb is used, the agent (\u2018hander\u2019), recipient\n(\u2018handee\u2019), and item transferred (\u2018handed\u2019)\nmust all be made explicit. Goldberg gives the following diagram of the\n\u201ccomposite structure\u201d that results when hand is\nused in the construction:\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this requirement of explicit presence, Hand him your\npass is grammatical, but *Hand him is not,\nand neither is *Hand your pass. The verb\nsend, on the other hand, illustrates the optional syntactic\nexpression of the recipient role: we can say Send a text\nmessage, which is understood to involve some recipient but does\nnot make the recipient explicit.\n\nThe R notation relates to the fact that particular verbs may express\neither an instance of causing someone to receive something,\nas with hand, or a means of causing someone to\nreceive something, as with kick: what Joe kicked Bill the\nball means is that Joe caused Bill to receive the ball by means\nof a kicking action.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s discussion covers many subtle ways in which the\nscenario communicated affects whether the use of a construction is\ngrammatical and appropriate. For example, there is something odd about\n?Joe kicked Bill the ball he was trying to kick to\nSam: the Ditransitive Construction seems best suited to cases of\nvolitional transfer (rather than transfer as an unexpected side effect\nof a blunder). However, an exception is provided by a class of cases\nin which the transfer is not of a physical object but is only\nmetaphorical: That guy gives me the creeps does not imply any\nvolitional transfer of a physical object.\n\nMetaphorical cases are distinguished from physical transfers in other\nways as well. Goldberg notes sentences like The music lent the\nevent a festive air, where the music is subject of the\nverb lend despite the fact that music cannot literally lend anything\nto anyone.\n\nGoldberg discusses many topics such as metaphorical extension,\nshading, metonymy, cutting, role merging, and also presents various\ngeneral principles linking meanings and constructions. One of these\nprinciples, the No Synonymy Principle, says that no two syntactically\ndistinct constructions can be both semantically and pragmatically\nsynonymous. It might seem that if any two sentences are synonymous,\npairs like this are:\n\n(C)\n\n\ni.\nShe gave her husband an iPod. [double object]\nii.\nShe gave an iPod to her husband. [recipient-PP]\n \n\n\nYet the two constructions cannot be fully synonymous, both\nsemantically and pragmatically, if the No Synonymy Principle is\ncorrect. And to support the principle, Goldberg notes purported\ncontrasts such as this:\n\n(D)\n\n\ni.\nShe gave her husband a new interest in music. [double\nobject]\nii.\n?She gave a new interest in music to her\nhusband. [recipient-PP]\n \n\n\nThere is a causation-as-transfer metaphor here, and it seems to be\ncompatible with the double object construction but not with the\nrecipient-PP. So (in Goldberg\u2019s view) the two are not fully\nsynonymous.\n\nIt is no part of our aim here to provide a full account of the content\nof Goldberg\u2019s discussion of double-object clauses. But what we\nwant to highlight is that the focus is not on finding abstract\nelements or operations of a purely syntactic nature that are\ncandidates for being essential properties of language per se. The\nfocus for Emergentists is nearly always on the ways in which meaning\nis conveyed, the scenarios that particular constructions are used to\ncommunicate, and the aspects of language that connect up with\npsychological topics like cognition, perception, and\nconceptualization.\n1.4.3 A typical Externalist analysis\n\nOne kind of work that is representative of the Externalist tendency is\nnicely illustrated by Bresnan et al. (2007) and Bresnan and Ford\n(2010). Bresnan and her colleagues defend the use of\ncorpora\u2014bodies of attested written and spoken texts. One of\ntheir findings is that a number of types of expressions that linguists\nhave often taken to be ungrammatical do in fact turn up in actual use.\nEssentialists and Emergentists alike have often, purely on the basis\nof intuition, asserted that sentences like John gave Mary a\nkiss are grammatical but sentences like John gave a kiss to\nMary are no, as we see above with Goldberg\u2019s (D)(ii).\nBresnan and her colleagues find numerous occurrences of the latter\nsort on the World Wide Web, and conclude that they are not\nungrammatical or even unacceptable, but merely dispreferred.\n\nBresnan and colleagues used a three-million-word collection of\nrecorded and transcribed spontaneous telephone conversations known as\nthe Switchboard corpus to study the double-object and recipient-PP\nconstructions. They first annotated the utterances with indications of\na number of factors that they thought might influence the choice\nbetween the double-object and recipient-PP constructions:\n\nDiscourse accessibility of NPs: does a particular NP refer to\nsomething already mentioned, or to something new to the\ndiscourse?\nRelative lengths of NPs: what is the difference in number of words\nbetween the recipient NP and the transferred-item NP?\nDefiniteness: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs definite\nlike the bishop or indefinite like some members\nAnimacy: do the recipient and transferred-item NPs denote animate\nbeings or inanimate things?\nPronominality: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs\npronouns?\nNumber: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs singular or\nplural?\nperson: are the recipient and transferred-item NPs first-person or\nsecond-person pronouns, or third person?\n\n\nThey also coded the verb meanings by assigning them to half a dozen\nsemantic categories:\n\nAbstract senses (give it some thought);\nTransfer of possession (give him an armband);\nFuture transfer of possession (I owe you a dollar);\nPrevention of possession (They denied me my rights);\nCommunication verb sense (tell me your name).\n\n\nThey then constructed a statistical model of the corpus: a\nmathematical formula expressing, for each combination of the factors\nlisted above, the ratio of the probabilities of the double object and\nthe recipient-PP. (To be precise, they used the natural logarithm of\nthe ratio of p to 1 \u2212 p, where p is\nthe probability of a double-object or recipient-PP in the corpus being\nof the double-object form.) They then used logistic regression to\npredict the probability of fit to the data.\n\nTo determine how well the model generalized to unseen data, they\ndivided the data randomly 100 times into a training set and a testing\nset, fit the model parameters on each training set, and scored its\npredictions on the unseen testing set. The average percent of correct\npredictions on unseen data was 92%. All components of the model except\nnumber of the recipient NP made a statistically significant\ndifference\u2014almost all at the 0.001 level.\n\nWhat this means is that knowing only the presence or absence of the\nsort of factors listed above they were reliably able to predict\nwhether double-object or recipient-PP structures would be used in a\ngiven context, with a 92% score accuracy rate.\n\nThe implication is that the two kinds of structure are not\ninterchangeable: they are reliably differentiated by the presence of\nother factors in the texts in which they occur.\n\nThey then took the model they had generated for the telephone speech\ndata and applied it to a corpus of written material: the Wall\nStreet Journal corpus (WSJ), a collection of 1987\u20139\nnewspaper copy, only roughly edited. The main relevant difference with\nwritten language is that the language producer has more opportunity to\nreflect thoughtfully on how they are going to phrase things. It was\nreasonable to think that a model based on speech data might not\ntransfer well. But instead the model had 93.5% accuracy. The authors\nconclude is that \u201cthe model for spoken English transfers\nbeautifully to written\u201d. The main difference between the corpora\nwas found to be a slightly higher probability of the recipient-PP\nstructure in written English.\n\nIn a very thorough subsequent study, Bresnan and Ford (2010) show that\nthe results also correlate with native speakers\u2019 metalinguistic\njudgments of naturalness for sentence structures, and with lexical\ndecision latencies (speed of deciding whether the words in a text were\ngenuine English words or not), and with a sentence completion task\n(choosing the most natural of a list of possible completions of a\npartial sentence). The results of these experiments confirmed that\ntheir model predicted participants\u2019 performance.\n\nAmong the things to note about this work is that it was all done on\ndirectly recorded performance data: transcripts of people speaking to\neach other spontaneously on the phone in the case of the Switchboard\ncorpus, stories as written by newspaper journalists in the case of\nWSJ, measured responses of volunteer subjects in a laboratory in the\ncase of the psycholinguistic experiments of Bresnan and Ford (2010).\nThe focus is on identifying the factors in linguistic performance that\npermit accurate prediction of future performance, and the methods of\ninvestigation have a replicability and checkability that is familiar\nin the natural sciences.\n\nHowever, we should make it clear that the work is not some kind of\nclose-to-the-ground collecting and classifying of instances. The\nmodels that Bresnan and her colleagues develop are sophisticated\nmathematical abstractions, very far removed from the records of\nutterance tokens. They claim that these models \u201callow linguistic\ntheory to solve more difficult problems than it has in the past, and\nto build convergent projects with psychology, computer science, and\nallied fields of cognitive science\u201d (Bresnan et al. 2007:\n69).\n1.4.4 Conclusion\n\nIt is important to see that the contrast we have drawn here is not\njust between three pieces of work that chose to look at different\naspects of the phenomena associated with double-object sentences. It\nis true that Larson focuses more on details of tree structure,\nGoldberg more on subtle differences in meaning, and Bresnan et al. on\nfrequencies of occurrence. But that is not what we are pointing to.\nWhat we want to stress is that we are illustrating three different\nbroad approaches to language that regard different facts as likely to\nbe relevant, and make different assumptions about what needs to be\naccounted for, and what might count as an explanation.\n\nLarson looks at contrasts between different kinds of clause with\ndifferent meanings and see evidence of abstract operations affecting\nsubtle details of tree structure, and parallelism between derivational\noperations formerly thought distinct.\n\nGoldberg looks at the same facts and sees evidence not for anything to\ndo with derivations but for the reality of specific\nconstructions\u2014roughly, packets of syntactic, semantic, and\npragmatic information tied together by constraints.\n\nBresnan and her colleagues see evidence that readily observable facts\nabout speaker behavior and frequency of word sequences correlate\nclosely with certain lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties of\nwords.\n\nNothing precludes defenders of any of the three approaches from paying\nattention to any of the phenomena that the other approaches attend to.\nThere is ample opportunity for linguists to mix aspects of the three\napproaches in particular projects. But in broad outline there are\nthree different tendencies exhibited here, with stereotypical views\nand assumptions roughly as we laid them out in Table 1.\n2. The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories\n\nThe complex and multi-faceted character of linguistic phenomena means\nthat the discipline of linguistics has a whole complex of\ndistinguishable subject matters associated with different research\nquestions. Among the possible topics for investigation are these:\n\nthe capacity of humans to acquire, use, and invent languages;\nthe abstract structural patterns (phonetic, morphological,\nsyntactic, or semantic) found in a particular language under some\nidealization;\nsystematic structural manifestations of the use of some particular\nlanguage;\nthe changes in a language or among languages across time;\nthe psychological functioning of individuals who have successfully\nacquired particular languages;\nthe psychological processes underlying speech or linguistically\nmediated thinking in humans;\nthe evolutionary origin of (i), and/or (ii).\n\n\nThere is no reason for all of the discipline of linguistics to\nconverge on a single subject matter, or to think that the entire field\nof linguistics cannot have a diverse range of subject matters. To give\na few examples:\n\nThe influential Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1916)\ndistinguished between langue, a socially shared set of\nabstract conventions (compare with (ii)) and parole, the\nparticular choices made by a speaker deploying a language (compare\n(iii)).\nThe anthropological linguist Edward Sapir (1921, 1929) thought\nthat human beings have a seemingly species-universal capacity to\nacquire and use languages (compare (i)), but his own interest was\nlimited to the systematic structural features of particular languages\n(compare (ii)) and the psychological reality of linguistic units such\nas the phoneme (an aspect of (vi)), and the psychological effects of\nlanguage and thought (an aspect of (v)).\nBloomfield (1933) showed a strong interest in historical\nlinguistic change (compare (iv)), distinguishing that sharply (much as\nSaussure did) from synchronic description of language structure ((ii)\nagain) and language use (compare (iii)), arguing that the study of\n(iv) presupposed (vi).\nBloomfield famously eschewed all dualistic mentalistic approaches\nto the study of language, but since he rejected them on materialist\nontological grounds, his rejection of mentalism was not clearly a\nrejection of (vi) or (vii): his attempt to cast linguistics in terms\nof stimulus-response psychology indicates that he was sympathetic to\nthe Weissian psychology of his time and accepted that linguistics\nmight have psychological subject matter.\nZellig Harris, on the other hand, showed little interest in the\npsychology of language, concentrating on mathematical techniques for\ntackling (ii).\n\n\nMost saliently of all, Harris\u2019s student Chomsky reacted strongly\nagainst indifference toward the mind, and insisted that the principal\nsubject matter of linguistics was, and had to be, a narrow\npsychological version of (i), and an individual, non-social, and\ninternalized conception of (ii).\n\nIn the course of advancing his view, Chomsky introduced a number of\nnovel pairs of terms into the linguistics literature: competence vs.\nperformance (Chomsky 1965); \u2018I-language\u2019 vs.\n\u2018E-language\u2019 (Chomsky 1986); the faculty of language in\nthe narrow sense vs. the and faculty of language in the broad sense\n(the \u2018FLN\u2019 and \u2018FLB\u2019 of Hauser et al. 2002).\nBecause Chomsky\u2019s terminological innovations have been adopted\nso widely in linguistics, the focus of sections 2.1\u20132.3 will be\nto examine the use of these expressions as they were introduced into\nthe linguistics literature and consider their relation to\n(i)\u2013(vii).\n2.1 Competence and performance\n\nEssentialists invariably distinguish between what Chomsky (1965)\ncalled competence and performance.\nCompetence is what knowing a language confers: a tacit grasp of the\nstructural properties of all the sentences of a language. Performance\ninvolves actual real-time use, and may diverge radically from the\nunderlying competence, for at least two reasons: (a) an attempt to\nproduce an utterance may be perturbed by non-linguistic factors like\nbeing distracted or interrupted, changing plans or losing attention,\nbeing drunk or having a brain injury; or (b) certain capacity limits\nof the mechanisms of perception or production may be overstepped.\n\nEmergentists tend to feel that the competence/performance distinction\nsidelines language use too much. Bybee and McClelland put it this\nway:\n\nOne common view is that language has an essential and unique inner\nstructure that conforms to a universal ideal, and what people say is a\npotentially imperfect reflection of this inner essence, muddied by\nperformance factors. According to an opposing view\u2026language use\nhas a major impact on language structure. The experience that users\nhave with language shapes cognitive representations, which are built\nup through the application of general principles of human cognition to\nlinguistic input. The structure that appears to underlie language use\nreflects the operation of these principles as they shape how\nindividual speakers and hearers represent form and meaning and adapt\nthese forms and meanings as they speak. (Bybee and McClelland 2005:\n382)\n\n\nAnd Externalists are often concerned to describe and explain not only\nlanguage structure, but also the workings of processing mechanisms and\nthe etiology of performance errors.\n\nHowever, every linguist accepts that some idealization away from the\nspeech phenomena is necessary. Emergentists and Externalists are\nalmost always happy to idealize away from sporadic speech errors. What\nthey are not so keen to do is to idealize away from limitations on\nlinguistic processing and the short-term memory on which it relies.\nAcceptance of a thoroughgoing competence/performance distinction thus\ntends to be a hallmark of Essentialist approaches, which take the\nnature of language to be entirely independent of other human cognitive\nprocesses (though of course capable of connecting to them).\n\nThe Essentialists\u2019 practice of idealizing away from even\npsycholinguistically relevant factors like limits on memory and\nprocessing plays a significant role in various important debates\nwithin linguistics. Perhaps the most salient and famous is the issue\nof whether English is a finite-state language.\n\nThe claim that English is not accepted by any finite-state automaton\ncan only be supported by showing that every grammar for English has\ncenter- embedding to an unbounded depth (see Levelt 2008: 20\u201323\nfor an exposition and proof of the relevant theorem, originally from\nChomsky 1959). But even depth-3 center-embedding of clauses (a clause\ninterrupting a clause that itself interrupts a clause) is in practice\nextraordinarily hard to process. Hardly anyone can readily understand\neven semantically plausible sentences like Vehicles that engineers\nwho car companies trust build crash every day. And such sentences\nvirtually never occur, even in writing. Karlsson (2007) undertakes an\nextensive examination of available textual material, and concludes\nthat depth-3 center-embeddings are vanishingly rare, and no genuine\ndepth-4 center-embedding has ever occurred at all in naturally\ncomposed text. He proposes that there is no reason to regard\ncenter-embedding as grammatical beyond depth 3 (and for spoken\nlanguage, depth 2). Karlsson is proposing a grammar that stays close\nto what performance data can confirm; the standard Essentialist view\nis that we should project massively from what is observed, and say\nthat depth-n center-embedding is fully grammatical for all\nn.\n2.2 \u2018I-Language\u2019 and \u2018E-Language\u2019\n\nChomsky (1986) introduced into the linguistics literature two\ntechnical notions of a language: \u2018E-Language\u2019 and\n\u2018I-Language\u2019. He deprecates the former as either\nundeserving of study or as a fictional entity, and promotes the latter\nas the only scientifically respectable object of study for a serious\nlinguistics.\n2.2.1 \u2018E-language\u2019\n\nChomsky\u2019s notion \u2018E-language\u2019 is supposed to suggest\nby its initial \u2018E\u2019 both \u2018extensional\u2019\n(concerned with which sentences happen to satisfy a definition of a\nlanguage rather than with what the definition says) and\n\u2018external\u2019 (external to the mind, that is, non-mental).\nThe dismissal of E-language as an object of study is aimed at critics\nof Essentialism\u2014many but not all of those critics falling within\nour categories of Externalists and Emergentists.\n\nExtensional. First, there is an attempt to impugn the\nextensional notion of a language that is found in two radically\ndifferent strands of Externalist work. Some Externalist investigations\nare grounded in the details of attested utterances (as collected in\ncorpora), external to human minds. Others, with mathematical or\ncomputational interests, sometimes idealize languages as extensionally\ndefinable objects (typically infinite sets of strings) with a certain\nstructure, independently of whatever device might be employed to\ncharacterize them. A set of strings of words either is or is not\nregular (finite-state), either is or is not recursive (decidable),\netc., independently of forms of grammar statement. Chomsky (1986)\nbasically dismissed both corpus-based work and mathematical\nlinguistics simply on the grounds that they employ an extensional\nconception of language that is, a conception that removes the object\nof study from having an essential connection with the mental.\n\nExternal. Second, a distinct meaning based on\n\u2018external\u2019 was folded into the neologism\n\u2018E-language\u2019 to suggest criticism of any view that\nconceives of a natural language as a public, intersubjectively\naccessible system used by a community of people (often millions of\nthem spread across different countries). Here, the objection is that\nlanguages as thus conceived have no clear criteria of individuation in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions. On this conception, the\nsubject matter of interest is a historico-geographical entity that\nchanges as it is transmitted over generations, or over mountain\nranges. Famously, for example, there is a gradual valley-to-valley\nchange in the language spoken between southeastern France and\nnorthwestern Italy such that each valley\u2019s speakers can\nunderstand the next. But the far northwesterners clearly speak French\nand the far southeasterners clearly speak Italian. It is the\npolitically defined geographical border, not the intrinsic properties\nof the dialects, that would encourage viewing this continuum as two\ndifferent languages.\n\nPerhaps the most famous quotation by any linguist is standardly\nattributed to Max Weinreich (1945): \u2018A shprakh iz a dialekt mit\nan armey un flot\u2019 (\u2018A language is a dialect with an army\nand navy\u2019; he actually credits the remark to an unnamed\nstudent). The implication is that E-languages are defined in terms of\nnon-linguistic, non-essential properties. Essentialists object that a\nscientific linguistics cannot tolerate individuating French and\nItalian in a way that is subject to historical contingencies of wars\nand treaties (after all, the borders could have coincided with a\ndifferent hill or valley had some battle had a different outcome).\n\nConsiderations of intelligibility fare no better. Mutual\nintelligibility between languages is not a transitive relation, and\nsometimes the intelligibility relation is not even symmetric (smaller,\nmore isolated, or less prestigious groups often understand the\ndialects of larger, more central, or higher-prestige groups when the\nconverse does not hold). So these sociological facts cannot\nindividuate languages either.\n\nChomsky therefore concludes that languages cannot be defined or\nindividuated extensionally or mind-externally, and hence the only\nscientifically interesting conception of a \u2018language\u2019 is\nthe \u2018I-language\u2019 view (see for example Chomsky 1986: 25;\n1992; 1995 and elsewhere). Chomsky says of E-languages that \u201call\nscientific approaches have simply abandoned these elements of what is\ncalled \u2018language\u2019 in common usage\u201d (Chomsky 1988,\n37); and \u201cwe can define E-language in one way or another or not\nat all, since the concept appears to play no role in the theory of\nlanguage\u201d (Chomsky 1986: 26; in saying that it appears to play\nno role in the theory of language, here he means that it plays no role\nin the theory he favours).\n\nThis conclusion may be bewildering to non-linguists as well as\nnon-Essentialists. It is at odds with what a broad range of\nphilosophers have tacitly assumed or explicitly claimed about language\nor languages: \u2018[A language] is a practice in which people\nengage\u2026it is constituted by rules which it is part of social\ncustom to follow\u2019 (Dummett 1986: 473\u2013473); \u2018Language\nis a set of rules existing at the level of common knowledge\u2019 and\nthese rules are \u2018norms which govern intentional social\nbehavior\u2019 (Itkonen 1978: 122), and so on. Generally speaking,\nthose philosophers influenced by Wittgenstein also take the view that\na language is a social-historical entity. But the opposite view has\nbecome a part of the conceptual underpinning of linguistics for many\nEssentialists.\n\nFailing to have precise individuation conditions is surely not a\nsufficient reason to deny that an entity can be studied\nscientifically. \u2018Language\u2019 as a count noun in the\nextensional and socio-historical sense is vague, but this need not be\nany greater obstacle to theorizing about them than is the vagueness of\nother terms for historical entities without clear individuation\nconditions, like \u2018species\u2019 and \u2018individual\norganism\u2019 in biology.\n\nAt least some Emergentist linguists, and perhaps some Externalists,\nwould be content to say that languages are collections of social\nconventions, publicly shared, and some philosophers would agree (see\nMillikan 2003, for example, and Chomsky 2003 for a reply). Lewis\n(1969) explicitly defends the view that language can be understood in\nterms of public communications, functioning to solve coordination\nproblems within a group (although he acknowledges that the\ncoordination could be between different temporal stages of one\nindividual, so language use by an isolated person is also\nintelligible; see the appendix \u201cLewis\u2019s Theory of\nLanguages as Conventions\u201d in the entry on\n idiolects,\n for further discussion of Lewis). What Chomsky calls E-languages,\nthen, would be perfectly amenable to linguistic or philosophical\nstudy. Santana (2016) makes a similar argument in terms of scientific\nidealization. He argues that since all sciences idealize their\ntargets, Chomsky needs to do more to show why idealizations concerning\nE-languages are illicit (see also Stainton 2014).\n2.2.2 \u2018I-language\u2019\n\nChomsky (1986) introduced the neologism \u2018I-language\u2019 in\npart to disambiguate the word \u2018grammar\u2019. In earlier\ngenerative Essentialist literature, \u2018grammar\u2019 was\n(deliberately) ambiguous between (i) the linguist\u2019s generative\ntheory and (ii) what a speaker knows when they know a language.\n\u2018I-language\u2019 can be regarded as a replacement for\nBever\u2019s term \u2018psychogrammar\u2019 (see also George 1989):\nit denotes a mental or psychological entity (not a grammarian\u2019s\ndescription of a language as externally manifested).\n\nI-language is first discussed under the sub-heading of\n\u2018internalized language\u2019 to denote linguistic knowledge.\nLater discussion in Chomsky 1986 and 1995 makes it clear that the\n\u2018I\u2019 of \u2018I-language\u2019 is supposed to suggest at\nleast three English words: \u2018individual\u2019,\n\u2018internal\u2019, and \u2018intensional\u2019. And Chomsky\nemphasizes that the neologism also implies a kind of realism about\nspeakers\u2019 knowledge of language.\n\nIndividual. A language is claimed to be strictly a\nproperty of individual human beings\u2014not groups. The contrast is\nbetween the idiolect of a single individual, and a dialect or language\nof a geographical, social, historical, or political group. I-languages\nare properties of the minds of individuals who know them.\n\nInternal. As generative Essentialists see it, your\nI-language is a state of your mind/brain. Meaning is\ninternal\u2014indeed, on Chomsky\u2019s conception, an\nI-language\n\nis a strictly internalist, individualist approach to language,\nanalogous in this respect to studies of the visual system. If the\ncognitive system of Jones\u2019s language faculty is in state L, we\nwill say that Jones has the I-language L. (Chomsky 1995: 13)\n\n\nAnd he clarifies the sense in which an I-language is internal by\nappealing to an analogy with the way the study of vision is\ninternal:\n\nThe same considerations apply to the study of visual perception along\nlines pioneered by David Marr, which has been much discussed in this\nconnection. This work is mostly concerned with operations carried out\nby the retina; loosely put, the mapping of retinal images to the\nvisual cortex. Marr\u2019s famous three levels of\nanalysis\u2014computational, algorithmic, and\nimplementation\u2014have to do with ways of construing such mappings.\nAgain, the theory applies to a brain in a vat exactly as it does to a\nperson seeing an object in motion. (Chomsky 1995: 52)\n\n\nThus, while the speaker\u2019s I-language may be involved in\nperforming operations over representations of distal\nstimuli\u2014representations of other speaker\u2019s\nutterances\u2014I-languages can and should be studied in isolation\nfrom their external environments.\n\nAlthough Chomsky sometimes refers to this narrow individuation of\nI-languages as \u2018individual\u2019, he clearly claims that\nI-languages are individuated in isolation from both speech communities\nand other aspects of the broadly conceived natural environment:\n\nSuppose Jones is a member of some ordinary community, and J is\nindistinguishable from him except that his total experience derives\nfrom some virtual reality design; or let J be Jones\u2019s Twin in a\nTwin-Earth scenario. They have had indistinguishable experiences and\nwill behave the same way (in so far as behavior is predictable at\nall); they have the same internal states. Suppose that J replaces\nJones in the community, unknown to anyone except the observing\nscientist. Unaware of any change, everyone will act as before,\ntreating J as Jones; J too will continue as before. The scientist\nseeking the best theory of all of this will construct a narrow\nindividualist account of Jones, J, and others in the community. The\naccount omits nothing\u2026 (Chomsky 1995: 53\u201354)\n\n\nThis passage can also be seen as suggesting a radically intensionalist\nconception of language.\n\nIntensional. The way in which I-languages are\n\u2018intensional\u2019 for Chomsky needs a little explication. The\nconcept of intension is familiar in logic and semantics, where\n\u2018intensional\u2019 contrasts with \u2018extensional\u2019.\nThe extension of a predicate like blue is simply the set of all blue\nobjects; the intension is the function that picks out in a given world\nthe blue objects contained therein. In a similar way, the extension of\na set can be distinguished from an intensional description of the set\nin terms of a function: the set of integer squares is {1, 4, 9, 16,\n25, 36, \u2026}, and the intension could be given in terms of the\none-place function f such that f(n) =\nn \u00d7 n. One difference between the two accounts\nof squaring is that the intensional one could be applied to a\ndifferent domain (any domain on which the \u2018\u00d7\u2019\noperation is defined: on the rationals rather than the integers, for\nexample, the extension of the identically defined function is a\ndifferent and larger set containing infinitely many fractions).\n\nIn an analogous way, a language can be identified with the set of all\nand only its expressions (regardless of what sort of object an\nexpression is: a word sequence, a tree structure, a complete\nderivation, or whatever), which is the extensional view; but it can\nalso be identified intensionally by means of a recipe or formal\nspecification of some kind\u2014what linguists call a grammar. Ludlow\n(2011) considers the first I (individual) to be the weakest link and\nthus the most expendable. He argues in its stead for a concept of a\n\u201c\\(\\Psi\\)-language\u201d which allows for the possibility of\nthe I-language relating to external objects either constitutively or\notherwise. \n\nIn natural language semantics, an intensional context is one where\nsubstitution of co-extensional terms fails to preserve truth value\n(Scott is Scott is true, and Scott is the author of\nWaverley is true, but the truth of George knows that Scott is\nScott doesn\u2019t guarantee the truth of George knows that\nScott is the author of Waverly, so knows that\nestablishes an intensional context).\n\nChomsky claims that the truth of an I-language attribution is not\npreserved by substituting terms that have the same extension. That is,\neven when two human beings do not differ at all on what expressions\nare grammatical, it may be false to say that they have the same\nI-language. Where H is a human being and L is a language (in the\ninformal sense) and R is the relation of knowing (or having, or using)\nthat holds between a human being and a language, Chomsky holds, in\neffect, that R establishes an intensional context in statements of the\ntheory:\n\n[F]or H to know L is for H to have a certain I-language. The\nstatements of the grammar are statements of the theory of mind about\nthe I-language, hence structures of the brain formulated at a certain\nlevel of abstraction from mechanisms. These structures are specific\nthings in the world, with their properties\u2026 The I-language L\nmay be the one used by a speaker but not the I-language L\u2032 even\nif the two generate the same class of expressions (or other formal\nobjects) \u2026 L\u2032 may not even be a possible human\nI-language, one attainable by the language faculty. (Chomsky 1986: 23)\n\n\nThe idea is that two individuals can know (or have, or use) different\nI-languages that generate exactly the same strings of words, and even\ngive them exactly the same structures. This situation forms the basis\nof Quine\u2019s (1972) infamous critique of the psychological reality\nof generative grammars (see Johnson 2015 for a solution in terms of\ninvariance of \u2018behaviorally equivalent grammar formalisms, to\nuse Quine\u2019s terminology, see also Nefdt 2021 for a similar\nresolution in terms of structural realism in the philosophy of\nscience).\n\nThe generative Essentialist conception of an I-language is\nantithetical to Emergentist research programs. If the fundamental\nexplanandum of scientific linguistics is how actual linguistic\ncommunication takes place, one must start by looking at both internal\n(psychological) and external (public) practices and conventions in\nvirtue of which it occurs, and consider the effect of historical and\ngeographic contingencies on the relevant underlying processes. That\nwould not rule out \u2018I-language\u2019 as part of the explanans;\nbut some Emergentists seem to be fictionalists about\nI-languages, in an analogous sense to the way that Chomsky is a\nfictionalist about E-languages. Emergentists do not see a child as\nlearning a generative grammar, but as learning how to use a symbolic\nsystem for propositional communication. On this view grammars are mere\nartifacts that are developed by linguists to codify aspects of the\nrelevant systems, and positing an I-language amounts to projecting the\nlinguist\u2019s codification illegitimately onto human minds (see,\nfor example, Tomasello 2003).\n\nThe I-language concept brushes aside certain phenomena of interest to\nthe Externalists, who hold that the forms of actually attested\nexpressions (sentences, phrases, syllables, and systems of such units)\nare of interest for linguistics. For example, computational\nlinguistics (work on speech recognition, machine translation, and\nnatural language interfaces to databases) must rely on a conception of\nlanguage as public and extensional; so must any work on the utterances\nof young children, or the effects of word frequency on vowel\nreduction, or misunderstandings caused by road sign wordings. At the\nvery least, it might be said on behalf of this strain of Externalism\n(along the lines of Soames 1984) that linguistics will need careful\nwork on languages as intersubjectively accessible systems before\nhypotheses about the I-language that purportedly produces them can be\ninvestigated.\n\nIt is a highly biased claim that the E-language concept \u201cappears\nto play no role in the theory of language\u201d (Chomsky 1986: 26).\nIndeed, the terminological contrast seems to have been invented not to\nclarify a distinction between concepts but to nudge linguistic\nresearch in a particular direction.\n2.3 The faculty of language in narrow and broad senses\n\nIn Hauser et al. (2002) (henceforth HCF) a further pair of contrasting\nterms is introduced. They draw a distinction quite separate from the\ncompetence/performance and\n\u2018I-language\u2019/\u2018E-language\u2019 distinctions: the\n\u201clanguage faculty in the narrow sense\u201d (FLN) is\ndistinguished from the \u201clanguage faculty in the broad\nsense\u201d (FLB). According to HCF, FLB \u201cexcludes other\norganism-internal systems that are necessary but not sufficient for\nlanguage (e.g., memory, respiration, digestion, circulation,\netc.)\u201d but includes whatever is involved in language, and FLN is\nsome limited part of FLB (p. 1571) This is all fairly vague, but it is\nclear that FLN and FLB are both internal rather than external, and\nindividual rather than social.\n\nThe FLN/FLB distinction apparently aims to address the uniqueness of\none component of the human capacity for language rather than (say) the\ncontent of human grammars. HCF say (p. 1573) that \u201cOnly FLN is\nuniquely human\u201d; they \u201chypothesize that most, if not all,\nof FLB is based on mechanisms shared with nonhuman animals\u201d; and\nthey say:\n\n[T]he computations underlying FLN may be quite limited. In fact, we\npropose in this hypothesis that FLN comprises only the core\ncomputational mechanisms of recursion as they appear in narrow syntax\nand the mappings to the interfaces. (ibid.)\n\n\nThe components of FLB that HCF hypothesize are not part of FLN are the\n\u201csensory-motor\u201d and \u201cconceptual-intentional\u201d\nsystems. The study of the conceptual-intentional system includes\ninvestigations of things like the theory of mind; referential vocal\nsignals; whether imitation is goal directed; and the field of\npragmatics. The study of the sensory motor system, by contrast,\nincludes \u201cvocal tract length and formant dispersion in birds and\nprimates\u201d; learning of songs by songbirds; analyses of vocal\ndialects in whales and spontaneous imitation of artificially created\nsounds in dolphins; \u201cprimate vocal production, including the\nrole of mandibular oscillations\u201d; and \u201c[c]ross-modal\nperception and sign language in humans versus unimodal communication\nin animals\u201d.\n\nIt is presented as an empirical hypothesis that a core property of the\nFLN is \u201crecursion\u201d:\n\nAll approaches agree that a core property of FLN is recursion,\nattributed to narrow syntax\u2026FLN takes a finite set of elements\nand yields a potentially infinite array of discrete expressions. This\ncapacity of FLN yields discrete infinity (a property that also\ncharacterizes the natural numbers). (HCF, p. 1571)\n\n\nHCF leave open exactly what the FLN includes in addition to recursion.\nIt is not ruled out that the FLN incorporates substantive universals\nas well as the formal property of \u201crecursion\u201d. But\nwhatever \u201crecursion\u201d is in this context, it is apparently\nnot domain-specific in the sense of earlier discussions by generative\nEssentialists, because it is not unique to human natural language or\ndefined over specifically linguistic inputs and outputs: it is the\nbasis for humans\u2019 grasp of the formal and arguably non-natural\nlanguage of arithmetic (counting, and the successor function), and\nperhaps also navigation and social relations. It might be more\nappropriate to say that HCF identify recursion as a cognitive\nuniversal, not a linguistic one. And in that case it is difficult to\nsee how the so-called \u2018language faculty\u2019 deserves that\nname: it is more like a faculty for cognition and communication.\n\nThis abandonment of linguistic domain-specificity contrasts very\nsharply with the picture that was such a prominent characteristic of\nthe earlier work on linguistic nativism, popularized in different ways\nby Fodor (1983), Barkow et al. (1992), and Pinker (1994). And yet the\nHCF discussion of FLN seems to incline to the view that human language\ncapacities have a unique human (though not uniquely linguistic)\nessence.\n\nThe FLN/FLB distinction provides earlier generative Essentialism with\nan answer (at least in part) to the question of what the singularity\nof the human language faculty consists in, and it does so in a way\nthat subsumes many of the empirical discoveries of paleoanthropology,\nprimatology, and ethnography that have been part of highly influential\nin Emergentist approaches as well as neo-Darwinian Essentialist\napproaches. A neo-Darwinian Essentialist like Pinker will accept that\nthe language faculty involves recursion, but also will also hold (with\nEmergentists) that human language capacities originated, via natural\nselection, for the purpose of linguistic communication.\n\nThus, over the years, those Essentialists who follow Chomsky closely\nhave changed the term they use for their core subject matter from\n\u2018linguistic competence\u2019 to \u2018I-language\u2019 to\n\u2018FLN\u2019, and the concepts expressed by these terms are all\nslightly different. In particular, what they are counterposed to\ndiffers in each case.\n\nThe challenge for the generative Essentialist adopting the FLN/FLB\ndistinction as characterized by HCF is to identify empirical data that\ncan support the hypothesis that the FLN \u201cyields discrete\ninfinity\u201d. That will mean answering the question: discrete\ninfinity of what? HCF write that FLN \u201ctakes a finite set of\nelements and yields a potentially infinite array of discrete\nexpressions\u201d (p. 1571), which makes it clear that there must be\na recursive procedure in the mathematical sense, perhaps putting\natomic elements such as words together to make internally complex\nelements like sentences (\u201carray\u201d should probably be\nunderstood as a misnomer for \u2018set\u2019). But then they say,\nsomewhat mystifyingly:\n\nEach of these discrete expressions is then passed to the sensory-motor\nand conceptual-intentional systems, which process and elaborate this\ninformation in the use of language. Each expression is, in this sense,\na pairing of sound and meaning. (HCF, p. 1571)\n\n\nBut the sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional systems are concrete\nparts of the organism: muscles and nerves and articulatory organs and\nperceptual channels and neuronal activity. How can each one of a\n\u201cpotentially infinite array\u201d be \u201cpassed to\u201d\nsuch concrete systems without it taking a potentially infinite amount\nof time? HCF may mean that for any one of the expressions that FLN\ndefines as well-formed (by generating it) there is a possibility of\nits being used as the basis for a pairing of sound and meaning. This\nwould be closer to the classical generative Essentialist view that the\ngrammar generates an infinite set of structural descriptions; but it\nis not what HCF say.\n\nAt root, HCF is a polemical work intended to identify the view it\npromotes as valuable and all other approaches to linguistics as\notiose.\n\nIn the varieties of modern linguistics that concern us here, the term\n\u201clanguage\u201d is used quite differently to refer to an\ninternal component of the mind/brain (sometimes called internal\nlanguage or I-language).\u2026 However, this biologically and\nindividually grounded usage still leaves much open to interpretation\n(and misunderstanding). For example, a neuroscientist might ask: What\ncomponents of the human nervous system are recruited in the use of\nlanguage in its broadest sense? Because any aspect of cognition\nappears to be, at least in principle, accessible to language, the\nbroadest answer to this question is, probably, \u201cmost of\nit.\u201d Even aspects of emotion or cognition not readily verbalized\nmay be influenced by linguistically based thought processes. Thus,\nthis conception is too broad to be of much use. (HCF, p. 1570)\n\n\nIt is hard to see this as anything other than a claim that approaches\nto linguistics focusing on anything that could fall under the label\n\u2018E-language\u2019 are to be dismissed as useless.\n\nSome Externalists and Emergentists actually reject the idea that the\nhuman capacity for language yields \u201ca potentially infinite array\nof expressions\u201d. It is often pointed out by empirically inclined\ncomputational linguists that in practice there will only ever be a\nfinite number of sentences to be dealt with (though the people saying\nthis may underestimate the sheer vastness of the finite set involved).\nAnd naturally, for those who do not believe there are generative\ngrammars in speakers\u2019 heads at all, it holds a fortiori that\nspeakers do not have grammars in their heads generating infinite\nlanguages (see Nefdt 2019c for a scientific modeling perspective on\nthe infinity postulate). Externalists and Emergentists tend to hold\nthat the \u201cdiscrete infinity\u201d that HCF posits is more\nplausibly a property of the generative Essentialists\u2019 model of\nlinguistic competence, I-language, or FLN, than a part of the human\nmind/brain. This does not mean that non-Essentialists deny that actual\nlanguage use is creative, or (of course) that they think there is a\nlongest sentence of English. But they may reject the link between\nlinguistic productivity or creativity and the mathematical notion of\nrecursion (see Pullum and Scholz 2010).\n\nHCF\u2019s remarks about how FLN \u201cyields\u201d or\n\u201cgenerates\u201d a specific \u201carray\u201d assume that\nlanguages are clearly and sharply individuated by their generators.\nThey appear to be committed to the view that there is a fact of the\nmatter about exactly which generator is in a given speaker\u2019s\nhead. Emergentists tend not to individuate languages in this way, and\nmay reject generative grammars entirely as inappropriately or\nunacceptably \u2018formalist\u2019. They are content with the notion\nthat the common-sense concept of a language is vague, and it is not\nthe job of linguistic theory to explain what a language is, any more\nthan it is the job of physicists to explain what material is, or of\nbiologists to explain what life is. Emergentists, in particular, are\ninterested not so much in identifying generators, or individuating\nlanguages, but in exploring the component capacities that facilitate\nlinguistic communication, and finding out how they interact.\n\nSimilarly, Externalists are interested in the linguistic structure of\nexpressions, but have little use for the idea of a discrete infinity\nof them, a view that is not, and cannot be empirically supported,\nunless one thinks of simplicity and elegance of theory as empirical\nmatters. They focus on the outward manifestations of language, not on\na set of expressions regarded as a whole language\u2014at least not\nin any way that would give a language a definite cardinality. Zellig\nHarris, an archetypal Externalist, is explicit that the reason for not\nregarding the set of utterances as finite concerns the elegance of the\nresulting grammar: \u201cIf we were to insist on a finite language,\nwe would have to include in our grammar several highly arbitrary and\nnumerical conditions\u201d (Harris 1957: 208). Infinitude, on his\nview is an unimportant side consequence of setting up a\nsentence-generating grammar in an uncluttered and maximally elegant\nway, not a discovered property of languages (see Pullum and Scholz\n2010 for further discussion).\n2.4 Linguistic Ontology\n\nNot all Essentialists agree that linguistics studies aspects of what\nis in the mind or aspects of what is human. There are some who do not\nsee language as either mental or human, and certainly do not regard\nlinguists as working on a problem within cognitive psychology or\nneurophysiology. The debate on the ontology of language has seen three\nmajor options emerging in the literature. Besides the mentalism of\nChomskyan linguistics, Katz (1981), Katz and Postal (1991) and Postal\n(2003) proffered a platonistic alternative and finally nominalism was\nproposed by Devitt (2006).\n\nHowever, the Katzian trichotomy is no longer a useful characterisation\nof the state-of-the-art in linguistic ontology. For one thing,\nKatzian-style linguistic Platonism has very few if any extant\nadherents. One reason for this situation is that linguistic platonists\nattempt to restage the debate on the foundations and metaphysics of\nnatural language within the philosophy of mathematics (see Katz\n1996). But even if this move was legitimate, it would only have opened\nup a range of possibilities including nominalism (Field 1980; Azzouni\n2004), structuralism (Hellman 1989; Shapiro 2007; Nefdt 2016), and\nforms of mentalism in the guise of intuitionism. For instance, while\nRichard Montague is often attributed with the view that linguistics\ncan be viewed as a branch of mathematics, it is unclear whether or not\nhe endorsed a platonistic ontology. Devitt (2006: 26) describes the\npossibility of a \u2018methodological platonism\u2019 in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n\nIt is often convenient to talk of objects posited by these theories as\nif they were types not tokens, as if they were Platonic objects, but\nthis need be nothing more than a manner of speaking: when the chips\nare down the objects are part of the spatiotemporal physical\nworld.\n\n\nDevitt\u2019s nominalism or \u2018linguistic conception\u2019 was\nnot around at the time of the original Katzian tripartite analysis. He\nargues that linguistics is an empirical science which studies\nlanguages as they are spoken by linguistic communities and viewing\nsentences as \u2018idealised tokens\u2019. Devitt\u2019s\n\u2018linguistic view\u2019 (as opposed to the \u2019psychological\nview\u2019 or Chomskyan mentalism) claims that grammars map onto\nbehavioural output of language production, of which speakers are\ngenerally ignorant.\n\nKatz took nominalism to have been refuted by Chomsky in his critiques\nof American structuralists in the 1960s. But, in Katz\u2019s opinion,\nChomsky had failed to notice that conceptualism was infected with many\nof the same faults as nominalism, because it too localized language\nspatiotemporally (in contingently existing, finite, human brains).\nSince contemporary Minimalist theories share in the earlier\nontological commitment, Katz\u2019 argument would presumably extent\nto them. Through an argument by elimination, Katz concluded that only\nplatonism remained, and must be the correct view to adopt. But this is\na false trichotomy and besides predating Devitt\u2019s more\nphilosophically grounded nominalism, it also fails to take linguistic\npluralism into account.\n\nRecent adherents of pluralism are Stainton (2014) and Santana (2016).\nSantana (2016) argues in favour of a pluralistic ontology for natural\nlanguage based on all of the major foundational approaches, including\nsociolinguistic ontology. His approach is thoroughly naturalistic in\nasking the ontological question through the lens of \u201cwhat sort\nof roles the concept of language plays in linguistic theory and\npractice\u201d (Santana, 2016: 501).\n\nThe first thing Santana does is to separate the discussion into two\nrelated questions, one scientific and the other metascientific or\n\u2018descriptive\u2019 and \u2018normative\u2019 in his terms. He\nclaims that \u201c[l]anguage, the scientific concept, is thus\ndescriptively whatever it is that linguists take as their primary\nobject of study, and normatively whatever it is they should be\nstudying\u201d (Santana, 2016: 501). Eventually he advocates a union\nof various ontologies based on the ineliminable status of each\nperspective (in that way the oppose of Katz\u2019 eliminative\nstrategy).\n\nStainton (2014) similarly proposes a pluralistic ontology but with a\nmore intersectional approach. His additional argument relates to how\nall of the views are indeed compatible. This argument is a response to\nan immediate objection along the lines of Postal (2003, 2009) as to\nthe incompatibility of the various ontologies associated with\nmentalism, Platonism, physicalism and public language views. Stainton\nbegins the pluralist apology in this way.\n\n\nThere is an obvious rebuttal on behalf of pluralism, namely that\n\u201cthe linguistic\u201d is a complex phenomenon with parts that\nbelong to distinct ontological categories. This shouldn\u2019t\nsurprise, since even \u201cthe mathematical\u201d is like this: Two\nwholly physical dogs plus two other wholly physical dogs yields four\ndogs; there certainly is the mental operation of multiplying 26 by 84,\nthe mental state of thinking about the square root of 7, and so on.\n(2014: 5)\n\n\nHis main argument against incompatibility, and in favour of\nintersection, is that the former rests on an equivocation of the terms\n\u2018mental\u2019, \u2018abstract\u2019 and even\n\u2018physical\u2019. Once the equivocation is cleared up, it is\nargued, hybrid ontological objects are licensed. The argument goes\nthat appreciating the nuanced physical and mental and what he calls\n\u2018abstractish\u2019 nature of natural language will dissolve\nworries about ontological inconsistency and open the door for\nintersection. Consider some other members of this category of\nobjects.\n\n\nIndeed, our world is replete with such hybrid objects: psychocultural\nkinds (e.g. dining room tables, footwear, bonfires, people, sport\nfishing [...]; intellectual artifacts (college diplomas,\ndrivers\u2019 licenses, the Canadian dollar [...]; and institutions\n(MIT\u2019s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Disneyworld\n[...] (Stainton, 2014: 6).\n\n\nDespite the decline in interest in the ontology of language itself,\nphilosophers have recently embraced a subset of this debate in the\nphilosophy of linguistic objects with a special focus on words. There\nis a recent debate in philosophy on the philosophy of what Rey (2006,\n2020) calls \u2018Standard Linguistic Entities\u2019 (SLEs) or\ntokens of word, sentence, morpheme, and phonemes types. Rey then\ndefines a position called \u2019physical tokenism\u2019 or PT as the\nassumption that SLEs can be identified with physical (acoustic)\nspatio-temporal phenomena. He doesn\u2019t think that SLEs share the\nsame kind of existence as his trusty Honda. In fact he thinks that\nthey are \u2018intentional inexistents\u2019 (borrowed from\nBrentano, see the\n SEP entry\n on \u2018Brentano\u2019s Theory of Judgement, see also the section\nentitled \u2018Intentional Inexistence\u2019 in the\n entry on Intentionality)\n or purely intentional uses of the term \u2018represents\u2019 which\ndenote fictions of a particular sort. Linguistic theory according to\nhim is only committed to the intentional contents of things like\nnouns, verbs, verb phrases etc. where \u201can (intentional) content\nis whatever we understand x to be when we use the idiom\n\u2018represent(ation of) x\u2019 but there is no real x\u201d\n(2006: 242).\n\nThere has been some theoretical work on the nature of entities like\nphrases and words in linguistics. For example, Ross (2010) argues that\nthe concept of parts of speech is fuzzy. Similarly, Szab\u00f3\n(2015) rejects the idea that parts of speech should be identified by\ndistributional analysis as is common in syntax. Instead he offers a\nsemantic approach based on predicate logic where the aim is to model\nthe major lexical categories directly in terms of open class\nconstants. This, he claims, results in a reduction of the gap between\ngrammar and logic. So, for instance, nouns become not types\ncorresponding to distributionally defined syntactic objects but rather\nopen lexical constants used for reference such that the semantic\nclause only needs to involve a universal quantifier and a variable\nspecified in terms of reference. Verbs, on the other hand, are\nconstants which purport to predicate (for more details, see\nSzab\u00f3 2015 and Nefdt 2020). For Haspelmath (2011) a central\nproblem is the concept of wordhood. He identifies ten morphosyntactic\ncriteria for words as the best possible candidates over seemingly\ninferior semantic or phonological options. He shows all of them to be\nwanting, with the result among other things being that \u201cthe\nnotion of lexical integrity is not well supported and should not be\nappealed to in explaining grammatical phenomena\u201d (Haspelmath,\n2011: 33). The very notion of wordhood, although intuitive and\ncentral, is unclear upon further scrutiny. Yet, in linguistics there\nis continual hope for a resolution, that there is something more than\nessential inexistence at stake. Haspelmath thinks this is a vain hope,\nand attributes it to the influence of orthography on the thought of\nlinguist researchers.\n\nPhilosophers have been traditionally interested in the metaphysics of\nSLEs with a special focus on the ontological status of words.\nInterestingly, this literature showcases variations on the\nfoundational debates on the ontology of language. As Miller (2020)\nnotes:\n\n\nWords play various roles in our lives. Some insult, some inspire, and\nwords are central to communication. The aim of an ontology of words is\nto determine what entities, if any, can play those roles and possess\n(or instantiate) these properties. (2)\n\n\nHowever the positions advocated are somewhat more nuanced than the\noriginal Katzian trichotomy suggests. They usually start with the\nproblem of word individuation expressed in the following manner:\n\n\nThink of the following line: A rose is a rose is a rose. How many\nwords are there in this line? If we were to count words themselves,\nnot their instances, the answer is three: rose, is, and a. If we were\nto count the concrete instances we see on a piece of paper, the answer\nis eight. The line, however, can be taken as an abstract type; a\nsequence of shapes. (Irmak, 2019: 1140)\n\n\nFurther complications are introduced by reference to words like\n\u201ccolor\u201d and \u201ccolour\u201d. Here the idea is that\nthe phonological profile of a word is a guide to its identity. But\nthis fails in other cases.\n\n\nNow take the name MOHAMMED. Since Arabic does not notate vowels, the\nname has been transcribed in a wide variety of ways in English, and\nsome of such transcriptions present important discrepancies: For\nexample, \u201cMohammad\u201d and \u201cMehmood.\u201d Even if we\nknow that they originated from the same source, the difference between\nthe two forms is considerable, and intuitions about their being\nvariants of the same name are less clear. What is the point up to\nwhich differences in spelling are consistent with word identity?\n(Gasparri, 2021: 594)\n\n\nWord individuation goes beyond this initial characterisation and it is\nnot always clear how the many accounts deal with the more complex\nquestions directly in their metaphysical pursuits. For instance,\nissues not usually mentioned in the literature, but which seem equally\nimportant are related to whether pitch in \u2018They poured pitch all\nover the parking lot\u2019 and \u2018The players swarmed the pitch\nafter they won the game\u2019 are different words. What about words\nwithin different syntactic categories, such as \u2018watch\u2019\n(time-telling device) and \u2018watch\u2019 (observe)? Are\n\u201cain\u2019t\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d and\n\u201caren\u2019t\u201d different words? What about simple cases of\ninflectional morphology such as like \u2018toy\u2019 and\n\u2018toys\u2019? \n\nAccording to Nefdt (2019b), the identity of a word is tied to its role\nin the sentence structure. In which case, \u201cain\u2019t\u201d\nand \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d come out as the same word (at least in\nthe singular use) but \u2018watch\u2019 (noun) and\n\u2018watch\u2019 (verb) do not. However, counterintuitively, his\naccount might license the identity of words like \u2018truck\u2019\nand \u2018lorry\u2019.\n\nThere are two strong but separate traditions which can both lay claim\nto being the \u2018received position\u2019. Within linguistics, the\nidea of a word as a LEXEME or mental dictionary entry is commonplace\n(with stipulations for senses, irregular forms, and selectional\ncriteria). Most introductory textbooks assume something of this sort.\nIn the philosophical literature, on the other hand, a mild or\nmethodological version of platonism is often presupposed. This view\nhas it that words can be separated into types and tokens, where the\nformer lack specific spatiotemporal features and the latter\ninstantiate these forms somehow.\n\nThe latter intuition seems to characterize most views on the ontology\nof words. Bromberger (1989) defines what he calls \u201cthe Platonic\nRelationship Principle\u201d or the principle that allows us to\n\u2018impute properties to types after observing and judging some of\ntheir tokens\u2019 (Bromberger 1989, 62). While Bromberger (1989,\n2011) represents the pinnacle of the classical philosophy of\nlinguistics approach to these questions. In a more metaphysical mode,\nDavid Kaplan (1990, 2011) constructs a thoroughly physicalist proposal\nin which words are modelled in terms of a stages and continuants:\n\n\nI propose a quite different model according to which utterances and\ninscriptions are stages of words, which are the continuants made up of\nthese interpersonal stages along with some more mysterious\nintrapersonal stages. (Kaplan 1990: 98)\n\n\nFor him, what individuates words is the intention of the user (see\nCappelen (1999) for an objection to intentional accounts tout court).\nUnfortunately, fascinating as Kaplan\u2019s proposal is, it does not\nattempt to reflect on linguistic theory directly. In fact, one major\ncriticism of his view, courtesy of Hawthorne and Lepore (2011), is\nthat it fails to account for uninstantiated word-types whose existence\nis guaranteed by derivational morphology, whether or not they\u2019ve\nbeen tokened or baptized in the real world. Other notable accounts are\nWetzel\u2019s (2009) Platonism (see the\n SEP entry on abstract objects)\n and Szab\u00f3\u2019s (1999) representational/nominalist view.\n\nThe philosophy of words has recently seen a resurgence in interest\namong philosophers, especially on the ontological issues. Miller\n(2021), for example, attempts to apply a bundle theory to the task of\nword individuation and identification. Irmak (2019) suggests that\nwords are abstract artifacts (similarly to Katz and Wetzel) but\ninsists that they are more akin to musical scores or works of fiction\nwhich have temporal components (\u201ctemporal abstracta\u201d as he\ncalls it). Mallory (2020) advocates the position that words are not\nreally objects in the ordinary sense. However, he opts for an\naction-theoretic approach in which tokens provide instructions for the\nperformance of action-types where our normal understanding of\n\u2018word\u2019 is to be identified with those types. His view is\novertly naturalistic and focuses on the concept of words which is\ndrawn from contemporary linguistic theory. Similarly, Nefdt (2019b)\nproffers a mathematical structuralist interpretation of SLEs in which\nthe definition of words is continuous with the ontology of phrases and\nsentences. Here he follows Jackendoff (2018) who uses model-theoretic\n(Pullum 2013) or constraint-based grammar formalisms to argue for a\ncontinuum between words and linguistic rules. In other words, these\nlatter two authors reject the idea that words are somehow sui generis\nentities in need of discontinuous explanation. Gasparri (2020)\nsuggests pluralism is a more solid foundation for the ontology of\nwords. He evaluates both \u201cbundlistic\u201d views such as\nMiller\u2019s and causal-historical accounts such as Irmak\u2019s\nbefore offering an alternative \u201cview that there is a plurality\nof epistemically virtuous ways of thinking about the nature of\nwords\u201d (608).\n\nThese are of course complex issues and they offer a lens through which\nto appreciate the erstwhile debate on the ontology of language but\nwith a contemporary and more focused flavor. Not all of the authors\nwho work on the philosophy of words consider the role of linguistic\ntheory to be central. Hence their work might be related but it does\nnot quite qualify as the philosophy of linguistics, where this is\nviewed as a subfield of the philosophy of science. By contrast, we\nhave focused on the authors who directly engage with linguistic theory\nin their accounts of the ontology of SLEs. There is also no clear\nmapping between the various ontological accounts mentioned here and\nthe characterizations of linguistic theorizing in terms of\nExternalism, Emergentism and Essentialism. No particular metaphysical\nview unifies any of our three groupings. For example, not all\nExternalists incline toward nominalism; numerous Emergentists as well\nas most Essentialists take linguistics to be about mental phenomena;\nand our Essentialists include Katz\u2019s platonism alongside the\nChomskyan \u2018I-language\u2019 advocates and pluralists embrace\naspects of all of the above.\n2.5 Components of linguistic theories\n\nLinguists\u2019 conception of the components of the study of language\ncontrast with philosophers\u2019 conceptions (even those of\nphilosophers of language) in at least three ways. First, linguists are\noften intensely interested in small details of linguistic form in\ntheir own right. Second, linguists take an interest in whole topic\nareas like the internal structure of phrases, the physics of\npronunciation, morphological features such as conjugation classes,\nlexical information about particular words, and so on\u2014topics in\nwhich there is typically little philosophical payoff. And third,\nlinguists are concerned with relations between the different\nsubsystems of languages: the exact way the syntax meshes with the\nsemantics, the relationship between phonological and syntactic facts,\nand so on.\n\nWith regard to form, philosophers broadly follow Morris (1938), a\nfoundational work in semiotics, and to some extent Peirce (see SEP\nentry: Peirce, semiotics), in thinking of the theory of language as\nhaving three main components:\n\nsyntax, which treats of the form of signs;\nsemantics, which deals with the relations of signs to\ntheir denotations; and\npragmatics, which concerns the contextualized use of\ninterpreted signs.\n\n\nLinguists, by contrast, following both Sapir (1921) and Bloomfield\n(1933), treat the syntactic component in a more detailed way than\nMorris or Peirce, and distinguish between at least three kinds of\nlinguistic form: the form of speech sounds (phonology), the form of\nwords (morphology), and the form of sentences. (If syntax is about the\nform of expressions in general, then each of these would be an element\nof Morris\u2019s syntax.)\n\nEmergentists in general deny that there is a distinction between\nsemantics and pragmatics\u2014a position that is familiar enough in\nphilosophy: Quine (1987: 211), for instance, holds that \u201cthe\nseparation between semantics and pragmatics is a pernicious\nerror.\u201d And generally speaking, those theorists who, like the\nlater Wittgenstein, focus on meaning as use will deny that one can\nseparate semantics from pragmatics. Emergentists such as Paul Hopper\n& Sandra Thompson agree:\n\n[W]hat is called semantics and what is called pragmatics are an\nintegrated whole. (Hopper and Thompson 1993: 372)\n\n\nSome Essentialists\u2014notably Chomsky\u2014also deny that\nsemantics can be separated from pragmatics, but unlike the\nEmergentists (who think that semantics-pragmatics is a starting point\nfor linguistic theory), Chomsky (as we noted briefly in section 1.3)\ndenies that semantics and pragmatics can have any role in\nlinguistics:\n\n\nIt seems that other cognitive systems\u2014in particular, our system\nof beliefs concerning things in the world and their\nbehavior\u2014play an essential part in our judgments of meaning and\nreference, in an extremely intricate manner, and it is not at all\nclear that much will remain if we try to separate the purely\nlinguistic components of what in informal usage or even in technical\ndiscussion we call \u2018the meaning of [a] linguistic\nexpression.\u2019 (Chomsky 1979; 142)\n\n\nRegarding the theoretical account of the relation between words or\nphrases and what speakers take them to refer to, Chomsky says,\n\u201cI think such theories should be regarded as a variety of\nsyntax\u201d (Chomsky 1992: 223).\n\nNot every Essentialist agrees with Chomsky on this point. Many believe\nthat every theory should incorporate a linguistic component that\nyields meanings, in much the same way that many philosophers of\nlanguage believe there to be such a separate component. Often,\nalthough not always, this component amounts to a truth-theoretic\naccount of the values of syntactically-characterized sentences. This\ntypically involves a translation of the natural language sentence into\nsome representation that is \u201cintermediate\u201d between natural\nlanguage and a truth-theory\u2014perhaps an augmented version of\nfirst-order logic, or perhaps a higher-order intensional language. The\nEssentialists who study semantics in such ways usually agree with\nChomsky in seeing little role for pragmatics within linguistic theory.\nBut their separation of semantics from pragmatics allows them to\naccord semantics a legitimacy within linguistics itself, and not just\nin psychology or sociology.\n\nSuch Essentialists, as well as the Emergentists, differ in important\nways from classical philosophical logic in their attitudes towards\n\u201cthe syntactic-semantic interface\u201d, however. Philosophers\nof language and logic who are not also heavily influenced by\nlinguistics tend to move directly\u2014perhaps by means of a\n\u201csemantic intuition\u201d or perhaps from an intuitive\nunderstanding of the truth conditions involved\u2014from a natural\nlanguage sentence to its \u201cdeep, logical\u201d representation.\nFor example, they may move directly from (EX1) to (LF1):\n\n(EX1)\nEvery linguist admires P\u0101nini.\n(LF1)\nx(Linguist(x) \u2283 Admires(x,\np))\n\n\nAnd from there perhaps to a model-theoretic description of its\ntruth-conditions. A linguist, on the other hand, would aim to describe\nhow (EX1) and (LF1) are related. From the point of view of a\nsemantically-inclined Essentialist, the question is: how should the\nsyntactic component of linguistic theory be written so that the\nsemantic value (or, \u201clogical form representation\u201d) can be\nassigned? From some Emergentist points of view, the question is: how\ncan the semantic properties and communicative function of an\nexpression explain its syntactic properties?\n\nMatters are perhaps less clear with the Externalists\u2014at least\nwith those who identify semantic value with distribution in terms of\nneighboring words (there is a tradition stemming from the\nstructuralists of equating synonymy with the possibility of\nsubstitution in all contexts without affecting acceptability).\n\nMatters are in general quite a bit more subtle and tricky than (EX1)\nmight suggest. Philosophers have taken the natural language sentence\n(EX2) to have two logical forms, (LF2a) and (LF2b):\n\n(EX2)\nEvery linguist admires a philosopher.\n(LF2a)\n\u2200x(Linguist(x) \u2283\n\u2203y(Philosopher(y) \u2227\nAdmires(x,y)))\n(LF2b)\n\u2203x(Philosopher(x) \u2227\n\u2200y(Linguist(y) \u2283\nAdmires(y,x)))\n\n\nBut for the linguist interested in the syntax-semantics interface,\nthere needs to be some explanation of how (LF2a) and (LF2b) are\nassociated with (EX2). It could be a way in which rules can derive\n(LF2a) and (LF2b) from the syntactic representation of (EX2), as some\nsemantically-inclined Essentialists would propose, or a way to explain\nthe syntactic properties of (EX2) from facts about the meanings\nrepresented by (LF2a) and (LF2b), as some Emergentists might want. But\nthat they should be connected up in some way is something that\nlinguists would typically count as non-negotiable.\n3. Linguistic Methodology and Data\n\nThe strengths and limitations of different data gathering methods\nbegan to play an important role in linguistics in the early to\nmid-20th century. Voegelin and Harris (1951: 323) discuss several\nmethods that had been used to distinguish Amerindian languages and\ndialects:\n\nInformal elicitation: asking an informant for a\nmetalinguistic judgment on an expression. [E.g., \u201cIs this\nsentence grammatical?\u201d \u201cDo these two sentences mean the\nsame thing?\u201d]\nCorpus collection: gathering a body of naturally\noccurring utterances.\nControlled experimentation: testing informants in\nsome way that directly gauges their linguistic capacities.\n\n\nThey note that the anthropological linguists Boas and Sapir (who we\ntake to be proto-Emergentists) used the \u2018ask the\ninformant\u2019 method of informal elicitation, addressing questions\n\u201cto the informant\u2019s perception rather than to the data\ndirectly\u201d (1951: 324). Bloomfield (the proto-Externalist), on\nthe other hand, worked on Amerindian languages mostly by collecting\ncorpora, with occasional use of monolingual elicitation.\n\nThe preferred method of Essentialists today is informal elicitation,\nincluding elicitation from oneself. Although the techniques for\ngathering data about speakers and their language use have changed\ndramatically over the past 60 or more years, the general strategies\nhave not: data is still gathered by elicitation of metalinguistic\njudgments, collection of corpus material, or direct psychological\ntesting of speakers\u2019 reactions and behaviors. Different\nlinguists will have different preferences among these techniques, but\nit is important to understand that data could be gathered in any of\nthe three ways by advocates of any tendency. Essentialists,\nEmergentists, and Externalists differ as much on how data is\ninterpreted and used as on their views of how it should be\ngathered.\n\nA wide range of methodological issues about data collection have been\nraised in linguistics. Since gathering data by direct objective\nexperimental testing of informants is a familiar practice throughout\nthe social, psychological, medical, and biological sciences, we will\nsay little about it here, focusing instead on these five issues about\ndata:\n\nDisputes over the use of linguistic intuitions as linguistic\ndata;\nDifferences between grammaticality and acceptability\njudgments;\nDifferences between scales for measuring acceptability\njudgments;\nDebates about the reliability of informal judgment elicitation\nmethods; and\nIssues concerning the relevance and reliability of corpus\nevidence.\n\n3.1 Acrimony over linguistic intuitions\n\nThe debate in linguistics over the use of linguistic intuitions\n(elicited metalinguistic judgments) as data, and how that data should\nbe collected has resulted in enduring, rancorous, often ideologically\ntinged disputes over the past 45 years. The disputes are remarkable,\nif only for their fairly consistent venomous tone.\n\nAt their most extreme, many Emergentists and some Externalists cast\nthe debate in terms of whether linguistic intuitions should ever count\nas evidence for linguistic theorizing. And many Essentialists cast it\nin terms of whether anything but linguistic intuitions are ever really\nneeded to support linguistic theorizing.\n\nThe debate focuses on the Essentialists\u2019 notion of a mental\ngrammar, since linguistic intuitions are generally understood to be a\nconsequence of tacit knowledge of language. Emergentists who deny that\nspeakers have innate domain-specific grammars (competence,\nI-languages, or FLN) have raised a diverse range of objections to the\nuse of reports of intuitions as linguistic data. (But see Devitt 2006\nfor an understanding of linguistic intuitions that does not base them\non inferred tacit knowledge of competence grammars.) The following\npassages are representative Emergentist critiques of intuitions\n(elicited judgments):\n\n\nGenerative linguists typically respond to calls for evidence for the\nreality of their theoretical constructs by claiming that no evidence\nis needed over and above the theory\u2019s ability to account for\npatterns of grammaticality judgments elicited from native speakers.\nThis response is unsatisfactory on two accounts. First, such judgments\nare inherently unreliable because of their unavoidable meta-cognitive\novertones\u2026 Second, the outcome of a judgment (or the analysis\nof an elicited utterance) is invariably brought to bear on some\ndistinction between variants of the current generative theory, never\non its foundational assumptions. (Edelman and Christiansen 2003:\n60)\n\nThe data that are actually used toward this end in Generative Grammar\nanalyses are almost always disembodied sentences that analysts have\nmade up ad hoc, \u2026 rather than utterances produced by real\npeople in real discourse situations\u2026 In diametric opposition to\nthese methodological assumptions and choices, cognitive-functional\nlinguists take as their object of study all aspects of natural\nlanguage understanding and use\u2026 They (especially the more\nfunctionally oriented analysts) take as an important part of their\ndata not disembodied sentences derived from introspection, but rather\nutterances or other longer sequences from naturally occurring\ndiscourse. (Tomasello 1998: xiii)\n\n[T]he journals are full of papers containing highly questionable data,\nas readers can verify simply by perusing the examples in nearly any\nsyntax article about a familiar language. (Wasow and Arnold 2005:\n1484)\n\n\nIt is a common Emergentist objection that linguistic intuitions (taken\nto be reports of elicited judgments of the acceptability of\nexpressions not their grammaticality) are bad data points because not\nonly are they not usage data, i.e., they are metalinguistic, but also\nbecause they are judgments about linguist\u2019s invented example\nsentences. On neither count would they be clear and direct evidence of\nlanguage use and human communicative capacities\u2014the subject\nmatter of linguistics on the Emergentist view. A further objection is\nto their use by theorists to the exclusion of all other kinds of\nevidence. For example,\n\n[Formal linguistics] continues to insist that its method for gathering\ndata is not only appropriate, but is superior to others. Occasionally\na syntactician will acknowledge that no one type of data is\nprivileged, but the actual behavior of people in the field belies this\nconcession. Take a look at any recent article on formal syntax and see\nwhether anything other than the theorist\u2019s judgments constitute\nthe data on which the arguments are based. (Ferreira 2005: 372)\n\n\n\u201cFormal\u201d is Emergentist shorthand for referring to\ngenerative linguistics. And it should be noted that the practice by\nEssentialists of collapsing various kinds of acceptability judgments\nunder the single label \u2018intuitions\u2019 masks important\ndifferences. In principle there might be significant differences\nbetween the judgments of (i) linguists with a stake in what the\nevidence shows; (ii) linguists with experience in syntactic theory but\nno stake in the issue at hand; (iii) non-linguist native speakers who\nhave been tutored in how to provide the kinds of judgments the\nlinguist is interested in; and (iv) linguistically na\u00efve native\nspeakers.\n\nMany Emergentists object to all four kinds of reports of intuitions on\nthe grounds that they are not direct evidence language use. For\nexample, a common objection is based on the view that\n\n[T]he primary object of study is the language people actually produce\nand understand. Language in use is the best evidence we have for\ndetermining the nature and specific organization of linguistic\nsystems. Thus, an ideal usage-based analysis is one that emerges from\nobservation of such bodies of usage data, called corpora.\u2026\nBecause the linguistic system is so closely tied to usage, it follows\nthat theories of language should be grounded in an observation of data\nfrom actual uses of language. (Barlow and Kemmer 2002, Introduction)\n\n\nBut collections of linguists\u2019 reports of their own judgments are\nalso criticized by Emergentists as \u201carm-chair data\ncollection,\u201d or \u201cdata collection by introspection\u201d.\nAll parties tend to call this kind of data collection\n\u201cinformal\u201d\u2014though they all rely on either formally\nor informally elicited judgments to some degree.\n\nOn the other side, Essentialists tend to deny that usage data is\nadequate evidence by itself:\n\nMore than five decades of research in generative linguistics have\nshown that the standard generative methodology of hypothesis formation\nand empirical verification via judgment elicitation can lead to a\nveritable goldmine of linguistic discovery and explanation. In many\ncases it has yielded good, replicable results, ones that could not as\neasily have been obtained by using other data-gathering methods, such\nas corpus-based research\u2026[C]onsider the fact that parasitic gap\nconstructions\u2026are exceedingly rare in corpora\u2026. [T]hese\ndistributional phenomena would have been entirely impossible to\ndistill via any non-introspective, non-elicitation based data\ngathering method. Corpus data simply cannot yield such a detailed\npicture of what is licit and, more crucially, what is not licit for a\nparticular construction in a particular linguistic environment. (den\nDikken et al. 2007: 336)\n\n\nAnd Essentialists often seem to deny that they are guilty of what the\nEmergentist claims they are guilty of. For example, Chomsky appears to\nbe claiming that acceptability judgments are performance data, i.e.\nevidence of use:\n\nAcceptability is a concept that belongs to the study of performance,\nwhereas grammaticalness belongs to the study of competence\u2026\nLike acceptability, grammaticalness is, no doubt, a matter of\ndegree\u2026but the scales of grammaticalness and acceptability do\nnot coincide. Grammaticalness is only one of many factors that\ninteract to determine acceptability. (Chomsky 1965: 11)\n\n\nChomsky means to deny that acceptability judgments are direct evidence\nof linguistic competence. But it does not follow that\nelicited acceptability judgments are direct evidence of language\nuse.\n\nAnd as for the charge of \u201carm-chair\u201d collection methods,\nsome Essentialists claim to have shown that such methods are as good\nas more controlled experimental methods. For example, Sprouse and\nAlmeida report:\n\nWe formally tested all 469 data points from a popular generative\nsyntax textbook (Adger 2003) on 440 na\u00efve participants. Using\nthree different statistical analysis approaches (traditional\nstatistical tests, linear mixed-effects models, and Bayes factor\nanalysis), and adopting the assumption of critics that formal results\nare more \u2018true\u2019 than informal judgments, we estimated a\nmaximum replication failure rate of 2% for the 469 data points in\nAdger (2003)\u2026A replication rate of 98% suggests that the\nempirical foundation of generative syntactic theory is sound, at least\nfor the topics covered in Adger (2003). (p. 13 of Sprouse and Almeida,\nms 2010: see Other Internet Resources)\n\n\n(When they say \u201cformal results\u201d they apparently mean\n\u201cresults obtained by controlled experiments\u201d.) This can be\nread as either defending Essentialists\u2019 consulting of their own\nintuitions simpliciter, or their self-consultation of intuitions on\nuncontroversial textbook cases only. The former is much more\ncontroversial than the later.\n\nFinally, both parties of the debate engage in ad hominem attacks on\ntheir opponents. Here is one example of a classic ad hominem (tu\nquoque) attack on Emergentists in defense of constructed examples by\nEssentialists:\n\n[The charge made concerning \u201carmchair data collection\u201d]\nimplies that there is something intrinsic to generative grammar that\ninvites partisans of that framework to construct syntactic theories on\nthe evidence of a single person\u2019s judgments. Nothing could be\nfarther from the truth. The great bulk of publications in cognitive\nand functional linguistics follow the same practice. Of course,\nrhetorically many of the latter decry the use of\nlinguists\u2019 own intuitions as data. For example, in \u2026 an\nimportant collections [sic] of papers in cognitive-functional\nlinguistics, \u2026 only two contributors to the volume \u2026\npresent segments of natural discourse, neither filling even a page of\ntext. All of the other contributors employ examples constructed by the\nlinguists themselves. It is quite difficult to find any work\nin cognitive linguistics (and functional linguists are only slightly\nbetter) that uses multiple informants. It seems almost disingenuous\n\u2026 to fault generativists for what (for better or worse) is\nstandard practice in the field, regardless of theoretical allegiance.\n(Newmeyer 2007: 395)\n\n\nClearly, the mere fact that some Emergentists may in practice have\nmade use of invented examples in testing their theories does not tell\nagainst any cogent general objections they may have offered to such\npractice. What is needed is a decision on the methodological point,\nnot just a cry of \u201cYou did it too!\u201d.\n\nGiven the intolerance of each other\u2019s views, and the crosstalk\npresent in these debates, it is tempting to think that Emergentism and\nEssentialism are fundamentally incompatible on what counts as\nlinguistic data, since their differences are based on their different\nviews of the subject matter of linguistics, and what the phenomena and\ngoals of linguistic theorizing are. There is no doubt that the\nopposing sides think that their respective views are incompatible. But\nthis conclusion may well be too hasty. In what follows, we try to\npoint to a way that the dispute could be ameliorated, if not\nadjudicated.\n3.2 Grammaticality and acceptability judgments\n\nEssentialists who accept the competence/performance distinction of\nChomsky (1965) traditionally emphasize elicited acceptability judgment\ndata (although they need not reject data that is gathered using other\nmethods). But as Cowart notes:\n\nIn this view, which exploits the distinction between competence and\nperformance, the act of expressing a judgment of acceptability is a\nkind of linguistic performance. The grammar that a [generative\nEssentialist] linguistic theory posits in the head of a speaker does\nnot exercise exhaustive control of judgments\u2026 While forming a\nsentence judgment, a speaker draws on a variety of cognitive\nresources\u2026 The resulting [acceptability] judgments could\npattern quite differently than the grammaticality values we might like\nthem to reflect. (Cowart 1997: 7)\n\n\nThe grammaticality of an expression, on the standard generative\nEssentialist view, is the status conferred on it by the competence\nstate of an ideal speaker. But competence can never be exercised or\nused without potentially interfering performance factors like memory\nbeing exercised as well. This means that judgments about\ngrammaticality are never really directly available to the linguist\nthrough informant judgments: they have to be inferred from judgments\nof acceptability (along with any other relevant evidence).\nNevertheless, Essentialists do take acceptability judgments to provide\nfairly good evidence concerning the character of linguistic\ncompetence. In fact the use of informally gathered acceptability\njudgment data is a hallmark of post-1965 Essentialist practice.\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that only Essentialists\nmake use of such judgments. Many contemporary Externalists and\nEmergentists who reject the competence/performance distinction still\nuse informally gathered acceptability judgments in linguistic\ntheorizing, though perhaps not in theory testing. Emergentists tend to\ninterpret experimentally gathered judgment data as performance data\nreflecting the interactions between learned features of communication\nsystems and general learning mechanisms as deployed in communication.\nAnd Externalists use judgment data for corpus cleaning (see\nbelow).\n\nIt should be noted that sociolinguists and anthropological linguists\n(and we regard them as tending toward Emergentist views) often\ninformally elicit informant judgments not only about acceptability but\nalso about social and regional style and variation, and meaning. They\nmay ask informants questions like, \u201cWho would typically say\nthat?\u201d, or \u201cWhat does X mean in context XYZ?\u201d, or\n\u201cIf you can say WXY, can you say WXZ?\u201d (see Labov 1996:\n77).\n3.3 Assessing degrees of acceptability\n\nA generative grammar gives a finite specification of a set of\nexpressions. A psychogrammar, to the extent that it corresponds to a\ngenerative grammar, might be thought to equip a speaker to know (at\nleast in principle) absolutely whether a string is in the language.\nHowever, elicited metalinguistic judgments are uncontroversially a\nmatter of degree. A question arises concerning the scale on which\nthese degrees of acceptability should be measured.\n\nLinguists have implicitly worked with a scale of roughly half a dozen\nlevels and types of acceptability, annotating them with prefixed\nsymbols. The most familiar is the asterisk, originally used simply to\nmark strings of words as ungrammatical, i.e., as not belonging to the\nlanguage at all. Other prefixed marks have gradually become\ncurrent:\n\n\n\nprefix\napproximate meaning \n\n#\nsemantically anomalous: unacceptable in virtue of a bizarre\nmeaning \n\n%\nsubject to a \u2018dialect\u2019 split: judged grammatical\nonly by some speakers  \n\n\nBut other annotations have been used to indicate a gradation in the\nextent to which some sentences are unacceptable. No scientifically\nvalidated or explicitly agreed meanings have been associated with\nthese marks, but a tradition has slowly grown up of assigning prefixes\nsuch as those in Table 2 to signify degrees of unacceptability:\n\n\n\n\nprefix\napproximate meaning \n\n(no prefix)\nacceptable and thus presumably grammatical \n\n?\nof dubious acceptability, though probably grammatical \n\n??\nclearly unacceptable but possibly grammatical \n\n?*\nunacceptable enough to suggest probable ungrammaticality\n\n\n*\nunacceptable enough to suggest clear ungrammaticality \n\n**\ngrossly unacceptable, suggesting extreme ungrammaticality\n \n\n\nTable 2: Prefixes used to mark levels of\nacceptability\n\n\nSuch markings are often used in a way that suggests an ordinal\nscale, i.e. a partial ordering that is silent on anything\nother than equivalence in acceptability or ranking in degree of\nunacceptability.\n\nBy contrast, Bard et al. (1996: 39) point out, it is possible to use\ninterval scales, which additionally measure distance\nbetween ordinal positions. Interval scales of acceptability would\nmeasure relative distances between strings\u2014how much\nmore or less acceptable one is than another. Magnitude\nestimation is a method developed in psychophysics to measure\nsubjects\u2019 judgments of physical stimuli on an interval scale.\nBard et al. (1996) adapted these methods to linguistic acceptability\njudgments, arguing that interval scales of measurement are required\nfor testing theoretical claims that rely on subtle judgments of\ncomparative acceptability. An ordinal scale of acceptability can\nrepresent one expression as being less acceptable than another, but\ncannot support quantitative questions about how much less. Many\ngenerative Essentialist theorists had been suggesting that violation\nof different universal principles led to different degrees of\nunacceptability. According to Bard et al. (34\u201335), because there\nmay be \u201cdisproportion between the fineness of judgments people\ncan make and the symbol set available for recording them\u201d it\nwill not suffice to use some fixed scale such as this one:\n\n? < ?? < ?* < * < **\n\nindicating absolute degrees of unacceptability. Degrees of relative\nunacceptability must be measured. This is done by asking the informant\nhow much less acceptable one string is than another.\n\nMagnitude estimation can be used with both informal and experimental\nmethods of data collection. And data that is measured using interval\nscales can be subjected to much more mathematically sophisticated\ntests and analyses than data measured solely by an ordinal scale,\nprovided that quantitative data are available.\n\nIt should be noted that the value of applying magnitude estimation to\nthe judgment of acceptability has been directly challenged in two\nrecent papers. Weskott and Fanselow (2011) and Sprouse (2011) both\npresent critiques of Bard et al. (1996). Weskott and Fanselow compared\nmagnitude estimation data to standard judgments on binary and 7-point\nscales, and claim that magnitude estimation does not yield more\ninformation than other judgment tasks, and moreover can produce\nspurious variance. And Sprouse, on the basis of recent formalizations\nof magnitude estimation in the psychophysics literature, presents\nexperimental evidence that participants cannot make ratio judgments of\nacceptability (for example, a judgment that one sentence is precisely\nhalf as acceptable as another), which suggests that the magnitude\nestimation task probably provides the same interval-level data as\nother judgment tasks.\n3.4 Informal and experimental elicitation\n\nPart of the dispute over the reliability of informal methods of\nacceptability judgment elicitation and collection is between different\ngroups of Essentialists. Experimentally trained psycholinguists\nadvocate using and adapting various experimental methods that have\nbeen developed in the cognitive and behavioral sciences to collect\nacceptability judgments. And while the debate is often cast in terms\nof which method is absolutely better, a more appropriate question\nmight be when one method is to be preferred to the others. Those\ninclined toward less experimentally controlled methods point out that\nthere are many clear and uncontroversial acceptability judgments that\ndo not need to be shown to be reliable. Advocates of experimental\nmethods point out that many purportedly clear, uncontroversial\njudgments have turned out to be unreliable, and led to false empirical\ngeneralizations about languages. Both seem to be right in different\ncases.\n\nChomsky has frequently stated his view that the experimental\ndata-gathering techniques developed in the behavioral sciences are\nneither used nor needed in linguistic theorizing. For example:\n\nThe gathering of data is informal; there has been little use of\nexperimental approaches (outside of phonetics) or of complex\ntechniques of data collection and data analysis of a sort that can\neasily be devised, and that are widely used in the behavioral\nsciences. The arguments in favor of this informal procedure seem to me\nquite compelling; basically, they turn on the realization that for the\ntheoretical problems that seem most critical today, it is not at all\ndifficult to obtain a mass of crucial data without use of such\ntechniques. Consequently, linguistic work, at what I believe to be its\nbest, lacks many of the features of the behavioral sciences. (Chomsky\n1969: 56)\n\n\nHe also expressed the opinion that using experimental behavioral data\ncollection methods in linguistics \u201cwould be a waste of time and\nenergy\u201d (1969: 81).\n\nAlthough many Emergentists\u2014the intellectual heirs of\nSapir\u2014would accept \u2018ask-the-informant\u2019 data, we\nmight expect them to tend to accept experimental data-gathering\nmethods that have been developed in the social sciences. There is\nlittle doubt that strict followers of the methodology preferred by\nBloomfield in his later career would disapprove of \u2018ask the\ninformant\u2019 methods. Charles Hockett remarked:\n\nA language, as a set of habits, is a fragile thing, subject to minor\nmodification in the slightest breeze of circumstance; this, indeed, is\nits great source of power. But this is also why the\ntransformationalists (like the rest of us!), using themselves as\ninformants, have such a hard time deciding whether certain candidates\nfor sentencehood are really \u2018in their dialect\u2019 or not; and\nit is why Bloomfield, in his field work, would never elicit paradigms,\nfor fear he would induce his informant to say something under the\nartificial conditions of talking with an outsider that he would never\nhave said in his own everyday surroundings. (Hockett 1968:\n89\u201390, fn. 31)\n\n\nWe might expect Bloomfield, having abandoned his earlier Wundtian\npsychological leanings, to be suspicious of any method that could be\ncast as introspective. And we might expect many contemporary\nExternalists to prefer more experimentally controlled methods too. (We\nshall see below that to some extent they do.)\n\nDerwing (1973) was one early critic of Chomsky\u2019s view (1969)\nthat experimentally controlled data collection is useless; but it was\nnearly 25 years before systematic research into possible confounding\nvariables in acceptability judgment data started being conducted on\nany significant scale. In the same year that Bard et al. (1996)\nappeared, Carson Sch\u00fctze (1996) published a monograph with the\nfollowing goal statement:\n\nI aim to demonstrate\u2026that grammaticality judgments and other\nsorts of linguistic intuition, while indispensable forms of data for\nlinguistic theory, require new ways of being collected and used. A\ngreat deal is known about the instability and unreliability of\njudgments, but rather than propose that they be abandoned, I endeavor\nto explain the source of their shiftiness and how it can be minimized.\n(1996: 1)\n\n\nIn a similar vein, Wayne Cowart stated that he wanted to\n\u201cdescribe a family of practical methods that yield demonstrably\nreliable data on patterns of sentence acceptability.\u201d He\nobserves that the stability and reliability of acceptability judgment\ncollection is\n\ncomplicated by the fact that there seems to be no consensus on how to\ngather judgments apart from a widespread tolerance for informal\nmethods in which the linguist consults her own intuitions and those of\nthe first handy informant (what we might call the \u201cHey,\nSally\u201d method). (Cowart 1997: 2)\n\n\nSch\u00fctze also expresses the importance of using experimental\nmethods developed in cognitive science:\n\n[M]y claim is that none of the variables that confound\nmetalinguistic data are peculiar to judgments about language. Rather\nthey can be shown to operate in some other domain in a similar way.\n(This is quite similar to Valian\u2019s (1982) claim that the data of\nmore traditional psychological experiments have all the same problems\nthat judgment data have.) (Sch\u00fctze 1996: 14)\n\n\nThe above can be read as sympathetic to the Essentialist preference\nfor elicited judgments.\n\nAmong the findings of Sch\u00fctze and Cowart about informal judgment\ncollection methods are these:\n\nThere is really no agreement in linguistics on what counts as an\ninformal method (though see Sprouse and Almeida 2010 (Other Internet\nResources) for a flat contradiction of this claim).\nThe collection of acceptability judgment data is just as\nvulnerable to the influence of extraneous variables as are other kinds\nof psychological data.\nJudgment samples can be biased in informal judgment\ncollection.\nExperimenter bias is often not controlled for in informal judgment\ncollection.\nJudgment materials are often not carefully prepared to present a\nrelevant, well-ordered, contrasting set of minimal pairs.\nThe instability of one-off speaker judgments can be controlled for\nby gathering judgments from a given speaker across time.\n\n\nAlthough Sch\u00fctze (1996) and Cowart (1997) are both critical of\ntraditional Essentialist informal elicitation methods, their primary\nconcern is to show how the claims of Essentialist linguistics can be\nmade less vulnerable to legitimate complaints about informal data\ncollection methods. Broadly speaking, they are friends of\nEssentialism. Critics of Essentialism have raised similar concerns in\nless friendly terms, but it is important to note that the debate over\nthe reliability of informal methods is a debate within Essentialist\nlinguistics as well.\n3.5 What informal methods actually are\n\nInformal methods of acceptability judgment data have often been\ndescribed as excessively casual. Ferreira described the informal\nmethod this way:\n\nAn example sentence that is predicted to be ungrammatical is\ncontrasted with some other sentence that is supposed to be similar in\nall relevant ways; these two sentences constitute a \u201cminimal\npair\u201d. The author of the article provides the judgment that the\nsentence hypothesized to be bad is in fact ungrammatical, as indicated\nby the star annotating the example. But there are serious problems\nwith this methodology. The example that is tested could have\nidiosyncratic properties due to its unique lexical content.\nOccasionally a second or third minimal pair is provided, but no\nattempt is made to consider the range of relevant extraneous variables\nthat must be accounted for and held constant to make sure there\nisn\u2019t some correlated property that is responsible for the\ncontrast in judgments. Even worse, the \u201csubject\u201d who\nprovides the data is not a na\u00efve informant, but is in fact the\ntheorist himself or herself, and that person has a stake in whether\nthe sentence is judged grammatical or ungrammatical. That is, the\nperson\u2019s theory would be falsified if the prediction were wrong,\nand this is a potential source of bias. (Ferreira 2005: 372)\n\n\n(It would be appropriate to read \u2018grammatical\u2019 and\n\u2018grammaticality\u2019 in Ferreira\u2019s text as meaning\n\u2018acceptable\u2019 and \u2018acceptability\u2019.)\n\nThis critical characterization exemplifies the kind of method that\nSch\u00fctze and Cowart aimed to improve on. More recently, Gibson and\nFedorenko describe the traditional informal method this way:\n\nAs has often been noted in recent years (Cowart, 1997; Edelman &\nChristiansen, 2003; Featherston, 2007; Ferreira, 2005; Gibson &\nFedorenko, 2010a; Marantz, 2005; Myers, 2009; Sch\u00fctze, 1996;\nWasow & Arnold, 2005), the results obtained using this method are\nnot necessarily generalisable because of (a) the small number of\nexperimental participants (typically one); (b) the small number of\nexperimental stimuli (typically one); (c) cognitive biases on the part\nof the researcher and participants; and (d) the effect of the\npreceding context (e.g., other constructions the researcher may have\nbeen recently considering). (Gibson and Fedorenko, 2013)\n\n\nWhile some Essentialists have acknowledged these problems with the\nreliability of informal methods, others have, in effect, denied their\nrelevance. For example, Colin Phillips (2010) argues that \u201cthere\nis little evidence for the frequent claim that sloppy data-collection\npractices have harmed the development of linguistic theories\u201d.\nHe admits that not all is epistemologically well in syntactic theory,\nbut adds, \u201cI just don\u2019t think that the problems will be\nsolved by a few rating surveys.\u201d He concludes:\n\nI do not think that we should be fooled into thinking that informal\njudgment gathering is the root of the problem or that more formalized\njudgment collection will solve the problems. (Phillips 2010: 61)\n\n\nTo suggest that informal methods are as fully reliable as controlled\nexperimental ones would be a serious charge, implying that researchers\nlike Bard, Robinson, Sorace, Cowart, Sch\u00fctze, Gibson, Fedorenko,\nand others have been wasting their time. But Phillips actually seems\nto be making a different claim. He suggests first that informally\ngathered data has not actually harmed linguistics, and second that\nlinguists are in danger of being \u201cfooled\u201d by critics who\ninvent stories about unreliable data having harmed linguistics.\n\nThe harm that Phillips claims has not occurred relates to the charge\nthat \u201cmainstream linguistics\u201d (he means the current\ngenerative Essentialist framework called \u2018Minimalism\u2019) is\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d to broader interests in the cognitive\nsciences, and has lost \u201cthe initiative in language study\u201d.\nOf course, Phillips is right in a sense: one cannot insure that\nexperimental judgment collection methods will address every way in\nwhich Minimalist theorizing is irrelevant to particular endeavors\n(language description, language teaching, natural language processing,\nor broader questions in cognitive psychological research). But this\nclaim does not bear on what Sch\u00fctze (1996) and Cowart (1997) show\nabout the unreliability of informal methods.\n\nPhillips does not fully accept the view of Chomsky (1969) that\nexperimental methods are useless for data gathering (he says, \u201cI\ndo not mean to argue that comprehensive data gathering studies of\nacceptability are worthless\u201d). But his defense of informal\nmethods of data collection rests on whether these methods have damaged\nEssentialist theory testing:\n\n\nThe critiques I have read present no evidence of the supposed damage\nthat informal intuitions have caused, and among those who do provide\nspecific examples it is rare to provide clear evidence of the supposed\ndamage that informal intuitions have caused\u2026\n\nWhat I am specifically questioning is whether informal (and\noccasionally careless) gathering of acceptability judgments has\nactually held back progress in linguistics, and whether more careful\ngathering of acceptability judgments will provide the key to future\nprogress.\n\n\nEither Phillips is fronting the surprising opinion that generative\ntheorizing has never been led down the wrong track by demonstrably\nunreliable data, or he is changing the subject. And unless clear\ncriteria are established for what counts as \u201cdamage\u201d and\n\u201cholding back,\u201d Phillips is not offering any testable\nhypothesis about data collection methodology. For example, Phillips\ndiscounts the observation of Sch\u00fctze (1996) that conflicting\njudgments of relative unacceptability of violations of two linguistic\nuniversals held back the development of Government and Binding (GB),\non the grounds that two sets of conflicting judgments and their\nanalyses \u201care now largely forgotten, supplanted by theories that\nhave little to say about such examples.\u201d But the fact that the\nproposed universals are discarded principles of UG is irrelevant to\nthe effect that unreliable data once had on the (now largely\nabandoned) GB theory. A methodological concern cannot be dismissed on\nthe basis of a move to a new theory that abandons the old theory but\nnot its methods!\n\nMore recently, Bresnan (2007) claims that many theoretical claims have\narguably been supported by unreliable informally gathered syntactic\nacceptability judgments. She observes:\n\nErroneous generalizations based on linguistic intuitions about\nisolated, constructed examples occur throughout all parts of the\ngrammar. They often seriously underestimate the space of grammatical\npossibility (Taylor 1994, 1996, Bresnan & Nikitina 2003, Fellbaum\n2005, L\u00f8drup 2006, among others), reflect relative frequency\ninstead of categorical grammaticality (Labov 1996, Lapata 1999,\nManning 2003), overlook complex constraint interactions (Green 1971,\nGries 2003) and processing effects (Arnon et al. 2005a, b), and fail\nto address the problems of investigator bias (Labov 1975, Naro 1980,\nChambers 2003: 34) and social intervention (Labov 1996, Milroy 2001,\nCornips & Poletto 2005). (Bresnan 2007: 301)\n\n\nHer discussion supports the view that various highly abstract\ntheoretical hypotheses have been defended through the use of\ngeneralizations based on unreliable data.\n\nThe debate over the harm that the acceptance of informally collected\ndata has had on theory testing is somewhat difficult to understand for\nEssentialist, Externalist, and Emergentist researchers who have been\ntrained in the methods of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. Why\ntry to support one\u2019s theories of universal grammar, or of the\ngrammars of particular languages, by using questionably reliable\ndata?\n\nOne clue might be found in Culicover and Jackendoff (2010), who\nwrite:\n\n[T]heoreticians\u2019 subjective judgments are essential in\nformulating linguistic theories. It would cripple linguistic\ninvestigation if it were required that all judgments of ambiguity and\ngrammaticality be subject to statistically rigorous experiments on\nnaive subjects. (Culicover and Jackendoff 2010)\n\n\nThe worry is that use of experimental methods is so resource\nconsumptive that it would impede the formulation of linguistic\ntheories. But this changes the subject from the importance of using\nreliable data as evidence in theory testing to using only\nexperimentally gathered data in theory formulation. We are\nnot aware of anyone who has ever suggested that at the stage of\nhypothesis development or theory formulation the linguist should\neschew intuition. Certainly Bard et al., Sch\u00fctze, Cowart, Gibson\n& Fedorenko, and Ferreira say no such thing. The relevant issue\nconcerns what data should be used to test theories, which is\na very different matter.\n\nWe noted earlier that there are clear and uncontroversial\nacceptability judgments, and that these judgments are reliable data.\nThe difficulty lies in distinguishing the clear, uncontroversial, and\nreliable data from what only appears to be clear, uncontroversial, and\nreliable to a research community at a time. William Labov, the founder\nof modern quantitative sociolinguistics, who takes an Emergentist\napproach, proposed a set of working methodological principles in Labov\n(1975) for adjudicating when experimental methods should be\nemployed.\n\n\nThe Consensus Principle: If there is no reason to\nthink otherwise, assume that the judgments of any native speaker are\ncharacteristic of all speakers.\n\nThe Experimenter Principle: If there is any\ndisagreement on introspective judgments, the judgments of those who\nare familiar with the theoretical issues may not be counted as\nevidence.\n\nThe Clear Case Principle: Disputed judgments should\nbe shown to include at least one consistent pattern in the speech\ncommunity or be abandoned. If differing judgments are said to\nrepresent different dialects, enough investigation of each dialect\nshould be carried out to show that each judgment is a clear case in\nthat dialect. (Labov 1975, quoted in Sch\u00fctze 1996: 200)\n\n\nIf we accept that \u2018introspective judgments\u2019 are\nacceptability judgments, then Labov\u2019s rules of thumb are guides\nfor when to deploy experimental methods, although they no doubt need\nrefinement. However, it seems vastly more likely that careful\ndevelopment of such methodological rules of thumb can serve to improve\nthe reliability of linguistic data and adjudicate these methodological\ndisputes that seem largely independent of any particular approach to\nlinguistics.\n3.6 Corpus data\n\nIn linguistics, the goal of collecting corpus data is to identify and\norganize a representative sample of a written and/or spoken variety\nfrom which characteristics of the entire variety or genre can be\ninduced. Concordances of word usage in linguistic context have long\nbeen used to aid in the translation and interpretation of literary and\nsacred texts of particular authors (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas)\nand of particular texts (e.g. the Torah, the rest of the Old\nTestament, the Gospels, the Epistles). Formal textual criticism, the\nidentification of antecedently existing oral traditions that were\nlater redacted into Biblical texts, and author identification (e.g.\nfiguring out which of the Epistles were written by Paul and which were\nprobably not) began to develop in the late 19th century.\n\nThe development of computational methods for collecting, analyzing,\nand searching corpora have seen rapid development as computer memory\nhas become less expensive and search and analysis programs have become\nfaster. The first computer searchable corpus of American English, the\nBrown Corpus, developed in the 1960s, contained just over one million\nword tokens. The British National Corpus (BNC) is a balanced corpus\ncontaining over 100 million words\u2014a hundredfold size\nincrease\u2014of which 90% is written prose published from 1991 to\n1994 and 10% is spoken English. Between 2005 and 2007, billion-word\ncorpora were released for British English (ukWaC), German (deWaC), and\nItalian (itWaC)\u2014a thousand times bigger than the Brown corpus.\nAnd the entire World Wide Web probably holds about a thousand times as\nmuch as that\u2014around a trillion words. Thus corpus linguistics\nhas gone from megabytes of data (\u223c 103kB) to terabytes\nof data (\u223c 109kB) in fifty years.\n\nJust as a central issue concerning acceptability judgment data\nconcerns its reliability as evidence for empirical generalizations\nabout languages or idiolects, a central question concerning the\ncollection of corpus data concerns whether or not it is representative\nof the language variety it purports to represent. Some linguists make\nthe criterion of representativeness definitional: they call a\ncollection of samples of language use a corpus only if it has been\ncarefully balanced between different genres (conversation, informal\nwriting, journalism, literature, etc.), regional varieties, or\nwhatever.\n\nBut corpora are of many different kinds. Some are just very large\ncompilations of text from individual sources such as newspapers of\nrecord or the World Wide Web\u2014compilations large enough for the\ndiversity in the source to act as a surrogate for representativeness.\nFor example, a billion words of a newspaper, despite coming from a\nsingle source, will include not only journalists\u2019 news reports\nand prepared editorials but also quoted speech, political rhetoric,\nhumor columns, light features, theater and film reviews,\nreaders\u2019 letters, fiction items, and so on, and will thus\nprovide examples of a much wider variety of styles than one might have\nthought.\n\nCorpora are cleaned up through automatic or manual removal of such\nelements as numerical tables, typographical slips, spelling mistakes,\nmarkup tags, accidental repetitions (the the), larger-scale\nduplications (e.g., copies on mirror sites), boilerplate text\n(Opinions expressed in this email do not necessarily\nreflect\u2026), and so on (see Baroni et al. 2009 for a fuller\ndiscussion of corpus cleaning).\n\nThe entire web itself can be used as a corpus to some degree, despite\nits constantly changing content, its multilinguality, its many tables\nand images, and its total lack of quality control; but when it is, the\noutputs of searches are nearly always cleaned by disregarding unwanted\nresults. For example, Google searches are blind to punctuation,\ncapitalization, and sentence boundaries, so search results for to\nbe will unfortunately include irrelevant cases, such as where a\nsentence like Do you want to? happens to be followed by a\nsentence like Be careful.\n\nCorpora can be annotated in ways that permit certain kinds of analysis\nand grammar testing. One basic kind of annotation is part-of-speech\ntagging, in which each word is labeled with its syntactic category.\nAnother is lemmatization, which classifies the different\nmorphologically inflected forms of a word as belonging together\n(goes, gone, going, and went\nbelong with go, for example). A more thoroughgoing kind of\nannotation involves adding markup that encodes trees representing\ntheir structure; an example like That road leads to the\nfreeway might be marked up as a Clause within which the first two\nwords make up a Noun Phrase (NP), the last four constitute a Verb\nPhrase (VP), and so on, giving a structural analysis represented\nthus:\n\n\n\n\nSuch a diagram is isomorphic to (and the one shown was computed\ndirectly from) a labeled bracketing like this:\n\n(.Clause. (.NP. (.D. \u2018that\u2019 ) (.N. \u2018road\u2019 ) )\n(.VP. (.V. \u2018leads\u2019 ) (.PP. (.P. \u2018to\u2019 ) (.NP.\n(.D. \u2018the\u2019 ) (.N. \u2018freeway\u2019 ) ) ) ) )\n\nand this in turn could be represented in a markup language like XML\nas:\n\n\n<clause>\n <nounphrase>\n\n<determiner>that</determiner>\n\n<noun>road</noun>\n </nounphrase>\n\n<verbphrase>\n <verb>leads</verb>\n\n<prepphrase>\n <prep>to</prep>\n\n<nounphrase>\n <determiner>the</determiner>\n\n<noun>freeway</noun>\n </nounphrase>\n\n</prepphrase>\n\n</verbphrase>\n</clause>\n\n\n\nA corpus annotated with tree structure is known as a\ntreebank. Clearly, such a corpus is not a raw record\nof attested utterances at all; it is a combination of a collection of\nattested utterances together with a systematic attempt at analysing\ntheir structure. Whether the analysis is added manually or\nsemi-automatically, it is ultimately based on native speaker\njudgments. (Treebanks are often developed by graduate student\nannotators tutored by computational linguists; naturally, consistency\nbetween annotators is an issue that needs regular attention. See\nArtstein and Poesio, 2008, for discussion of the methodological\nissues.).\n\nOne of the purposes of a treebank is to permit the further\ninvestigation of a language and the checking of further linguistic\nhypotheses by searching a large database of previously established\nanalyses. It can also be used to test grammars, natural language\nprocessing systems, or machine learning programs.\n\nGoing beyond syntactic parse trees, it is possible to annotate corpora\nfurther, with information of a semantic and pragmatic nature. There is\nongoing computational linguistic research aimed at discovering\nwhether, for example, semantic annotation that is semi-automatically\nadded might suffice for recognition of whether a product review is\npositive or negative (what computational linguists call\n\u2018sentiment analysis\u2019).\n\nNotice, then, that using corpus data does not mean abandoning or\nescaping from the use of intuitions about acceptability or grammatical\nstructure: the results of a corpus search are generally filtered\nthrough the judgments of an investigator who decides which pieces of\ncorpus data are to be taken at face value and which are just bad hits\nor irrelevant noise.\n\nDifficult methodological issues arise in connection with the\ncollection, annotation, and use of corpus data. For example, there is\nthe issue of extremely rare expression tokens. Are they accurately\nrecorded tokens of expression types that turn up only in consequence\nof sporadic errors and should be dismissed as irrelevant unless the\ntopic of interest is performance errors? Are they due to errors in the\ncompilation of the corpus itself, corresponding to neither accepted\nusage nor sporadic speech errors? Or are they perfectly grammatical\nbut (for some extraneous reason) very rare, at least in that\nparticular corpus?\n\nMany questions arise about what kind of corpus is best suited to the\nresearch questions under consideration, as well as what kind of\nannotation is most appropriate. For example, as Ferreira (2005: 375)\npoints out, some large corpora, insofar as they have not been\ncleaned of speech errors, provide relevant data for studying the\ndistribution of speech disfluencies. In addition, probabilistic\ninformation about the relation between a particular verb and its\narguments has been used to show that \u201cverb-argument preferences\n[are] an essential part of the process of sentence\ninterpretation\u201d (Roland and Jurafsky 2002: 325): acceptability\njudgments on individual expressions do not provide information about\nthe distribution of a verb and its arguments in various kinds of\nspeech and writing. Studying conveyed meaning in context and\nidentification of speech acts will require a kind of data that\ndecontextualized acceptability judgments do not provide but\nsemantically annotated corpora might.\n\nMany Essentialists have been skeptical of the reliability of\nuncleaned, unanalyzed corpus data as evidence to support linguistic\ntheorizing, because it is assumed to be replete with strings that any\nnative speaker would judge unacceptable. And many Emergentists and\nExternalists, as well as some Essentialists, have charged that\ninformally gathered acceptability judgments can be highly unreliable\ntoo. Both worries are apposite; but the former does not hold for\nadequately cleaned and analyzed corpora, and the latter does not hold\nfor judgment data that has been gathered using appropriately\ncontrolled methods. In certain contested cases of acceptability, it\nwill of course be important to use both corpus and controlled\nelicitation methods to cross-compare.\n\nNotice that we have not in any way suggested that our three broad\napproaches to linguistics should differ in the kinds of data they use\nfor theory testing: Essentialists are not limited to informal\nelicitation; nor are Emergentists and Externalists denied access to\nit. In matters of methodology, at least, there is in principle an open\nmarket\u2014even if many linguists seem to think otherwise.\n4. Language Acquisition\n\nThe three approaches to linguistic theorizing have at least something\nto say about how languages are acquired, or could in principle be\nacquired. Language acquisition has had a much higher profile since\ngenerative Essentialist work of the 1970s and 1980s gave it a central\nplace on the agenda for linguistic theory.\n\nResearch into language acquisition falls squarely within the\npsychology of language; see the entry on\n language and innateness.\n In this section we do not aim to deal in detail with any of the\nvoluminous literature on psychological or computational experiments\nbearing on language acquisition, or with any of the empirical study of\nlanguage acquisition by developmental linguists, or the\n\u2018stimulus poverty\u2019 argument for the existence of innate\nknowledge about linguistic structure (Pullum and Scholz 2002). Our\ngoals are merely to define the issue of linguistic\nnativism, set it in context, and draw morals for our three\napproaches from some of the mathematical work on inductive language\nlearning.\n4.1 Linguistic nativism\n\nThe reader with prior acquaintance with the literature of linguistics\nwill notice that we have not made reference to any partitioning of\nlinguists into two camps called \u2018empiricists\u2019 and\n\u2018rationalists\u2019 (see e.g. Matthews 1984, Cowie 1999). We\ndraw a different distinction relating to the psychological and\nbiological prerequisites for first language acquisition. It divides\nnearly all Emergentists and Externalists from most Essentialists. It\nhas often been confused with the classical empiricist/rationalist\nissue.\n\nGeneral nativists maintain that the prerequisites for\nlanguage acquisition are just general cognitive abilities and\nresources. Linguistic nativists, by contrast, claim\nthat human infants have access to at least some specifically\nlinguistic information that is not learned from linguistic experience.\nTable 3 briefly sketches the differences between the two views.\n\n\n\n\ngeneral nativists\nlinguistic nativists \n\nLanguages are acquired mainly through the exercise of defeasible\ninductive methods, based on experience of linguistic\ncommunication\nLanguage cannot be acquired by defeasible inductive methods; its\nstructural principles must to a very large degree be unlearned\n\n\nThe unlearned capacities that underpin language acquisition\nconstitute a uniquely human complex of non-linguistic dispositions and\nmechanisms that also subserve other cognitive functions\nIn addition to various broadly language-relevant cognitive and\nperceptual capacities, language acquisition draws on an unlearned\nsystem of \u2018universal grammar\u2019 that constrains language\nform \n\nVarious non-human animal species may well have most or all of\nthe capacities that humans use for language acquisition\u2014though\nno non-human species seems to have the whole package, so interspecies\ndifferences are a matter of degree\nThere is a special component of the human mind which has the\ndevelopment of language as its key function, and no non-human species\nhas anything of the sort, so there is a difference in kind between the\nabilities of humans and other animals  \n\n\nTable 3: General and linguistic nativism\ncontrasted\n\n\nThere does not really seem to be anyone who is a complete\nnon-nativist: nobody really thinks that a creature with no unlearned\ncapacities at all could acquire a language. That was the point of the\nmuch-quoted remark by Quine (1972: 95\u201396) about how \u201cthe\nbehaviorist is knowingly and cheerfully up to his neck in innate\nmechanisms of learning-readiness\u201d. Geoffrey Sampson (2001, 2005)\nis about as extreme an opponent of linguistic nativism as one can\nfind, but even he would not take the failure of language acquisition\nin his cat to be unrelated to the cognitive and physical capabilities\nof cats.\n\nThe issue on which empirical research can and should be done is\nwhether some of the unlearned prerequisites that humans enjoy have\nspecifically linguistic content. For a philosophically-oriented\ndiscussion of the matter, see chapters 4\u20136 of Stainton (2006).\nFor extensive debate about \u201cthe argument from poverty of the\nstimulus\u201d, see Pullum and Scholz (2002) together with the six\ncritiques published in the same issue of The Linguistic\nReview and the responses to those critiques by Scholz and Pullum\n(2002).\n4.2 Language learnability\n\nLinguists have given considerable attention to considerations of\nin-principle learnability\u2014not so much the\ncourse of language acquisition as tracked empirically (the work of\ndevelopmental psycholinguists) but the question of how languages of\nthe human sort could possibly be learned by any kind of learner. The\ntopic was placed squarely on the agenda by Chomsky (1965); and a\nhugely influential mathematical linguistics paper by Gold (1967)has\ndominated much of the subsequent discussion.\n4.2.1 The Gold paradigm\n\nGold began by considering a reformulation of the standard\nphilosophical problem of induction. The trouble with the question\n\u2018Which hypothesis is correct given the totality of the\ndata?\u2019 is of course the one that Hume saw: if the domain is\nunbounded, no finite amount of data can answer the question. Any\nfinite body of evidence will be consistent with arbitrarily many\nhypotheses that are not consistent with each other. But Gold proposed\nreplacing the question with a very different one: Which tentative\nhypothesis is the one to pick, given the data provided so far,\nassuming a finite number of wrong guesses can be forgiven?\n\nGold assumed that the hypotheses, in the case of language learning,\nwere generative grammars (or alternatively parsers; he proves results\nconcerning both, but for brevity we follow most of the literature and\nneglect the very similar results on parsers). The learner\u2019s task\nis conceived of as responding to an unending input data stream\n(ultimately complete, in that every expression eventually turns up) by\nenunciating a sequence of guesses at grammars.\n\nAlthough Gold talks in developmental psycholinguistic terms about\nlanguage learners learning grammars by trial and error, his extremely\nabstract proofs actually make no reference to the linguistic content\nof languages or grammars at all. The set of all finite grammars\nformulable in any given metalanguage is computably enumerable, so\ngrammars can be systematically numbered. Inputs\u2014grammatical\nexpressions from the target language\u2014can also be numerically\nencoded. We end up being concerned simply with the existence or\nnon-existence of certain functions from natural number sequences to\nnatural numbers.\n\nA successful learner is one who uses a procedure that is guaranteed to\neventually hit on a correct grammar. For single languages, this is\ntrivial: if the target language is L and it is generated by a\ngrammar G, then the procedure \u201cAlways guess\nG\u201d does the job, and every language is learnable. What\nmakes the problem interesting is applying it to classes of\ngrammars. A successful learner for a class C is one who uses\na procedure that is guaranteed to succeed no matter what grammar from\nC is the target and no matter what the data stream is like\n(as long as it is complete and contains no ungrammatical\nexamples).\n\nGold\u2019s work has interesting similarities with earlier\nphilosophical work on inductive learning by Hilary Putnam (1963; it is\nnot clear whether Gold was aware of this paper). Putnam gave an\ninformal proof of a sort of incompleteness theorem for inductive\nregularity-learning devices: no matter what algorithm is used in a\nmachine for inducing regularities from experience, and thus becoming\nable to predict events, there will always be some possible\nenvironmental regularities that will defeat it. (As a simple example,\nimagine an environment giving an unbroken sequence of presentations\nall having some property a. If there is a positive integer\nn such that after n presentations the machine will\npredict that presentation number n + 1 will also have property\na, then the machine will be defeated by an environment\nconsisting of n presentations of a followed by one\nwith the incompatible property b\u2014the future need not\nalways resemble the past. But if on the other hand there is no such\nn, then an environment consisting of an unending sequence of\na presentations will defeat it.)\n\nGold\u2019s theorems are founded on certain specific idealizing\nassumptions about the language learning situation, some of which are\nintuitively very generous to the learner. The main ones are these:\n\nPre-set grammar class. A class of grammars from\namong which to select is fixed ab initio, and the learner\u2019s\nstrategy can be one that only works for that class.\nPre-set vocabulary. A finite universal vocabulary\nof elements V is fixed ab initio, and the learner can rely on\nnot encountering any other elements (though the learner does not know\nwhich subset of V is used in the target language).\nUnending input. The input (the evidence presented\nto the learner) goes on forever\u2014though it may contain arbitrary\nrepetitions, and a successful learner will always reach a point where\nno future evidence will cause a change of guess.\nExhaustive evidence. Ultimately every expression\nin the language will appear in the evidence presented to the\nlearner.\nNo noise. Every input example is a grammatical\nexpression of the target language.\nNo ordering restrictions. Any expression may\nappear at any point in the input data stream.\nNo memory limit. The learner can remember every\nexpression ever presented.\nNo time limit. Learning must be achieved after\nsome finite time, but no fixed bound is set in advance.\nGenerative grammar target. What is ultimately\nlearned is a generative grammar.\nNo statistics. Frequency of particular\nexpressions in the input plays no role in the learning process.\n\n\nThe most celebrated of the theorems Gold proved (using some reasoning\nremarkably similar to that of Putnam 1963) showed that a language\nlearner could be similarly hostage to malign environments. Imagine a\nlearner being exposed to an endless and ultimately exhaustive sequence\nof presented expressions from some target language\u2014Gold calls\nsuch a sequence a \u2018text\u2019. Suppose the learner does not\nknow in advance whether the language is infinite, or is one of the\ninfinitely many finite languages over the vocabulary V. Gold\nreasons roughly thus:\n\nThere must be some n such that an environment consisting\nof a sequence of n presented expressions all taken from a\ncertain finite language L1 (possibly with many\nrepetitions) will cause the learner to guess the target language is\nL1. (If there is not, then we already know how to\nbaffle the learner: the learner will be unable to learn\nL1 from any text.)\nBut if there is such an n, then the learner will be\nbaffled by any infinite target language that is a superset of them\nall: a text consisting of n presentations of expressions from\nL1 followed by n presentations of a\nslightly larger finite language L2, and so on\nforever (there is no largest finite language, and ex hypothesi the\nlearner will keep trying them all).\n\n\nLeaping too soon to the conclusion that the target language is\ninfinite will be disastrous, because there will be no way to retrench:\nno presented examples from a finite language\nLk will ever conflict with the hypothesis\nthat the target is some infinite superset of\nLk.\n\nThe relevance of all this to the philosophy of linguistics is that the\ntheorem just sketched has been interpreted by many linguists,\npsycholinguists, and philosophers as showing that humans could not\nlearn languages by inductive inference based on examples of language\nuse, because all of the well-known families of languages\ndefined by different types of generative grammar have the crucial\nproperty of allowing grammars for every finite language and for at\nleast some infinite supersets of them. But Gold\u2019s paper has\noften been over-interpreted. A few examples of the resultant mistakes\nfollow.\n\nIt\u2019s not about underdetermination. Gold\u2019s\nnegative results are sometimes wrongly taken to be an unsurprising\nreflection of the underdetermination of theories by finite bodies of\nevidence (Hauser et al. 2002 seem to make this erroneous equation on\np. 1577; so do Fodor and Crowther 2002, implicitly\u2014see Scholz\nand Pullum 2002, 204\u2013206). But the failure of\ntext-identifiability for certain classes of languages is different\nfrom underdetermination in a very important way, because there are\ninfinite classes of infinite languages that are identifiable\nfrom text. The first chapter of Jain et al. (1999) discusses an\nillustrative example (basically, it is the class containing, for all\nn > 0, the set of all strings with length greater than\nn). There are infinitely many others. For example, Shinohara\n(1990) showed that for any positive integer n the class of\nall languages generated by a context-sensitive grammar with not more\nthan n rules is learnable from text.\n\nIt\u2019s not about stimulus poverty. It has also\nsometimes been assumed that Gold is giving some kind of argument from\npoverty of the stimulus (there are signs of this in Cowie 1999, 194ff;\nHauser et al. 2002, 1577; and Prinz 2002, 210). This is very clearly a\nmistake (as both Laurence and Margolis 2001 and Matthews 2007 note):\nin Gold\u2019s text-learning scenario there is no stimulus poverty at\nall. Every expression in the language eventually turns up in the\nlearner\u2019s input.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news. It is sometimes\nforgotten that Gold established a number of optimistic results as well\nas the pessimistic one about learning from text. Given what he called\nan \u2018informant\u2019 environment rather than a text environment,\nwe see strikingly different results. An informant environment is an\ninfinite sequence of presentations sorted into two lists, positive\ninstances (expressions belonging to the target language) and negative\ninstances (not in the language). Almost all major language-theoretic\nclasses are identifiable in the limit from an informant environment\n(up to and including the class of all languages with a primitive\nrecursive characteristic function, which comes close to covering any\nlanguage that could conceivably be of linguistic interest), and all\ncomputably enumerable languages become learnable if texts are allowed\nto be sequenced in particular ways (see the results in Gold 1967 on\n\u2018anomalous text\u2019).\n\nGold did not give a necessary condition for a class to be identifiable\nin the limit from text, but Angluin (1980) later provided one (in a\nresult almost but not quite obtained by Wexler and Hamburger 1973).\nAngluin showed that a class C is text-identifiable iff every\nlanguage L in C has a finite \u201ctelltale\u201d\nsubset T such that if T is also proper subset of\nsome other language in C, that other language is not a proper\nsubset of L. This condition precludes guessing too large a\nlanguage. Once all the members of the telltale subset for L\nhave been received as input, the learner can safely make L\nthe current conjecture. The language to be identified must be either\nL or (if subsequent inputs include new sentences not in\nL) some larger language, but it can\u2019t be a proper\nsubset of L.\n\nJohnson (2004) provides a useful review of several other\nmisconceptions about Gold\u2019s work; e.g., the notion that it might\nbe the absence of semantics from the input that makes identification\nfrom text impossible (this is not the case).\n4.2.2 Gold\u2019s paradox\n\nSome generative Essentialists see a kind of paradox in Gold\u2019s\nresults\u2014a reductio on one or more of the assumptions he makes\nabout in-principle learnability. To put it very crudely, learning\ngenerative grammars from presented grammatical examples seems to have\nbeen proved impossible, yet children do learn their first languages,\nwhich for generative Essentialists means they internalize generative\npsychogrammars, and it is claimed to be an empirical fact that they\nget almost no explicit evidence about what is not in the\nlanguage (Brown and Hanlon 1970 is invariably cited to support this).\nContradiction. Gold himself suggested three escape routes from the\napparent paradox:\n\nAssume tighter limits on the pre-set grammar class. Perhaps, for\nexample, learners have an \u2018innate\u2019 grasp of some\ndefinition of the pre-set grammar class that guarantees its\nlearnability. (For example, identifiability in the limit from text\ncould be guaranteed by ensuring that the class of candidate languages\ndoes not contain both (a) some infinite set of finite languages and\n(b) some infinite language that is the union of all of them.)\nAssume learners get systematic information about what is\nnot in the language (perhaps indirectly, in ways not yet\nrecognized), so that the environment is of the informant type rather\nthan the text type.\nAssume some helpful feature is present in learning environments.\nThe \u2018no order restrictions\u2019 assumption might be false:\nthere could be regularities in the order of expressions in texts that\ncan support inferences about what is ungrammatical.\n\n\nAll three of these paths have been subsequently explored. Path (1)\nappealed to generative Essentialists. Chomsky (1981) suggested an\nextreme restriction: that universal grammar permitted only finitely\nmany grammars. This claim (for which Chomsky had little basis: see\nPullum 1983) would immediately guarantee that not all finite languages\nare humanly learnable (there are infinitely many finite languages, so\nfor most of them there would be no permissible grammar). Osherson and\nWeinstein (1984) even proved that under three fairly plausible\nassumptions about the conditions on learning, finiteness of the class\nof languages is necessary\u2014that is, a class must be\nfinite if it is to be identifiable from text. However, they also\nproved that this is not sufficient: there are very small finite\nclasses of languages that are not identifiable from text, so\nit is logically possible for text-identification to be impossible even\ngiven only a finite number of languages (grammars). These two results\nshow that Chomsky\u2019s approach cannot be the whole answer.\n\nPath (2) proposes investigation of children\u2019s input with an eye\nto finding covert sources of negative evidence. Various\npsycholinguists have pursued this idea; see the entry on\n language and innateness\n in this encyclopedia, and (to cite one example) the results of\nChouinard and Clark (2003) on hitherto unnoticed sources of negative\nevidence in the infant\u2019s linguistic environment, such as\nparental corrections.\n\nPath (3) suggests investigating the nature of children\u2019s\nlinguistic environments more generally. Making evidence available to\nthe learner in some fixed order can certainly alter the picture quite\nradically (Gold proved that if some primitive-recursive generator\ncontrols the text it can in effect encode the identity of the target\nlanguage so that all computably enumerable languages become\nidentifiable from text). It is possible in principle that limitations\non texts (or on learners\u2019 uptake) might have positive rather\nthan negative effects on learnability (see Newport 1988; Elman 1993;\nRohde and Plaut 1999; and the entry on\n language and innateness).\n4.2.3 The claimed link to \u2018rationalism\u2019 versus \u2018empiricism\u2019\n\nGold\u2019s suggested strategy of restricting the pre-set class of\ngrammars has been interpreted by some as a defense of rationalist\nrather than empiricist theories of language acquisition. For example,\nWexler and Culicover state:\n\nEmpiricist theory allows for a class of sensory or peripheral\nprocessing mechanisms by means of which the organism receives data. In\naddition, the organism possesses some set of inductive principles or\nlearning mechanisms\u2026Rationalist theory also assumes that a\nlearner has sensory mechanisms and inductive principles. But\nrationalist theory assumes that in addition the learner possesses a\nrich set of principles concerning the general nature of the ability\nthat is to be learned. (Wexler and Culicover 1980: 5)\n\n\nWexler and Culicover claim that \u2018empiricist\u2019 learning\nmechanisms are both weak and general: not only are they \u2018not\nrelated to the learning of any particular subject matter or cognitive\nability\u2019 but they are not \u2018limited to any particular\nspecies\u2019. It is of course not surprising that empiricist\nlearning fails if it is defined in a way that precludes drawing a\ndistinction between the cognitive abilities of humans and fruit\nflies.\n\nEquating Gold\u2019s idea of restricting the class of grammars with\nthe idea of a \u2018rationalist\u2019 knowledge acquisition theory,\nWexler and Culicover try to draw out the consequences of Gold\u2019s\nparadigm for the Essentialist linguistic theory of Chomsky (1965).\nThey show how a very tightly restricted class of transformational\ngrammars could be regarded as text-identifiable under extremely strong\nassumptions (e.g., that all languages have the same innately known\ndeep structures).\n\nMatthews (1984) follows Wexler and Culicover\u2019s lead and draws a\nmore philosophically oriented moral:\n\nThe significance of Gold\u2019s result becomes apparent if one\nconsiders that (i) empiricists assume that there are no constraints on\nthe class of possible languages (besides perhaps that natural\nlanguages be recursively enumerable), and (ii) the learner employs a\nmaximally powerful learning strategy\u2014there are no strategies\nthat could accomplish what that assumed by Gold cannot. These two\nfacts, given Gold\u2019s unsolvability result for text data,\neffectively dispose of the empiricist claim that there exists a\n\u2018discovery procedure\u2019. (1989: 60)\n\n\nThe actual relation of Gold\u2019s results to the\nempiricism/rationalism controversy seems to us rather different.\nGold\u2019s paradigm looks a lot more like a formalization of\nso-called \u2018rationalism\u2019. The fixed class of candidate\nhypotheses (grammars) corresponds to what is given by universal\ngrammar\u2014the innate definition of the essential properties of\nlanguage. What Gold actually shows, therefore, is not \u201cthe\nplausibility of rationalism\u201d but rather the inadequacy of a huge\nrange of rationalist theories: under a wide range of different choices\nof universal grammar, language acquisition appears to remain\nimpossible.\n\nMoreover, Matthews ignores (as most linguists have) the existence of\nlarge and interesting classes of languages that are\ntext-identifiable.\n\nGold\u2019s result, like Putnam\u2019s earlier one, does show that a\ncertain kind of trial-and-error inductive learning is insufficient to\npermit learning of arbitrary environmental regularities. There has to\nbe some kind of initial bias in the learning procedure or in the data.\nBut \u2018empiricism\u2019, the supposed opponent of\n\u2018rationalism\u2019, is not to be equated with a denial of the\nexistence of learning biases. No one doubts that humans have inductive\nbiases. To quote Quine again, \u201cInnate biases and dispositions\nare the cornerstone of behaviorism, and have been studied by\nbehaviorists\u201d (1972: 95\u201396). As Lappin and Shieber (2007)\nstress, there cannot be such a thing as a learning procedure (or\nprocessing mechanism) with no biases at all.\n\nThe biases posited in Emergentist theories of language acquisition are\nfound, at least in part, in the non-linguistic social and cognitive\nbases of human communication. And the biases of Externalist approaches\nto language acquisition are to be found in the distributional and\nstochastic structure of the learning input and the multitude of\nmechanisms that process that input and their interactions. All\ncontemporary approaches to language acquistion have acknowledged\nGold\u2019s results, but those results do not by themselves vindicate\nany one of our three approaches to the study of language.\n\nGold\u2019s explicit equation of acquiring a language with\nidentifying a generative grammar that exactly generates it naturally\nmakes his work seem relevant to generative Essentialists (though even\nfor them, his results do not provide anything like a sufficient reason\nfor adopting the linguistic nativist position). But another key\nassumption, that nothing about the statistical structure of the input\nplays a role in the acquisition process, is being questioned by\nincreasing numbers of Externalists, many of whom have used Bayesian\nmodeling to show that the absence of positive evidence can function as\na powerful source of (indirect) negative evidence: learning can be\ndriven by what is not found as well as by what is (see e.g. Foraker et\nal. (2009)).\n\nMost Emergentists simply reject the assumption that what is learned is\na generative grammar. They see the acquisition task as a matter of\nlearning the details of an array of constructions (roughly,\nmeaning-bearing ways of structurally composing words or phrases) and\nhow to use them to communicate. How such learning is accomplished\nneeds a great deal of further study, but Gold\u2019s paper did not\nshow it to be impossible.\n5. Language Evolution\n\nOver the past three decades a large amount of work has been done on\ntopics to which the term \u2018language evolution\u2019 is attached,\nbut there are in fact four distinct such topics:\n\nthe phylogenetic emergence of non-human\ncommunication capacities, systems, and behaviors in various\nanimals;\nthe phylogenetic emergence of uniquely human\ncommunication capacities, systems, and behaviors;\nthe phylogenetic emergence, unique in humans, of the capacity (or\ncapacities) to develop, acquire, and\nuse language;\nthe course of historical evolution through\nintergenerational changes in particular languages as they are acquired\nand used by humans.\n\n5.1 Phylogenetic emergence\n\nEmergentists tend to regard any of the topics (a)\u2013(d) as\npotentially relevant to the study of language evolution. Essentialists\ntend to focus solely on (c). Some Essentialists even deny that (a) and\n(b) have any relevance to the study of (c); for example:\n\nThere is nothing useful to be said about behavior or thought at the\nlevel of abstraction at which animal and human communication fall\ntogether\u2026 [H]uman language, it appears, is based on entirely\ndifferent principles. This, I think, is an important point, often\noverlooked by those who approach language as a natural, biological\nphenomenon; in particular, it seems rather pointless, for these\nreasons, to speculate about the evolution of human language from\nsimpler systems\u2026 (Chomsky 1968: 62)\n\n\nOther generative Essentialists, like Pinker and Bloom (1990) and\nPinker and Jackendoff (2005), seem open to the view that even the most\nelemental aspects of topic (b) can be directly relevant to the study\nof (c). This division among Essentialists reflects a division among\ntheir views about the role of adaptive explanations in the emergence\nof (b) and especially (c). For example:\n\nWe know very little about what happens when 1010 neurons\nare crammed into something the size of a basketball, with further\nconditions imposed by the specific manner in which this system\ndeveloped over time. It would be a serious error to suppose that all\nproperties, or the interesting properties of the structures that\nevolved, can be \u2018explained\u2019 in terms of \u2018natural\nselection\u2019. (Chomsky 1975:59, quoted by Newmeyer 1998 and\nJackendoff 2002)\n\n\nThe view expressed here that all (or even most) interesting properties\nof the language faculty are not adaptations conflicts with the basic\nexplanatory strategy of evolutionary psychology found in the\nneo-Darwinian Essentialist views of Pinker and Bloom.\nPiattelli-Palmarini (1989), following Chomsky, adopts a fairly\nstandard Bauplan critique of adaptationism. On this view the language\nfaculty did not originate as an adaptation, but more plausibly\n\u201cmay have originally arisen for some purely architectural or\nstructural reason (perhaps overall brain size, or the sheer\nduplication of pre-existing modules), or as a by product of the\nevolutionary pressures\u201d (p. 19), i.e., it is a kind of Gouldian\nspandrel.\n\nMore recently, some Essentialist-leaning authors have rejected the\nview that no analogies and homologies between animal and human\ncommunication are relevant to the study of language. For example, in\nthe context of commenting on Hauser et al. (2002), Tecumseh Fitch\n(2010) claims that \u201cAlthough Language, writ large, is unique to\nour species (many probably most) of the mechanisms involved in\nlanguage have analogues or homologues in other animals.\u201d\nHowever, the view that the investigation of animal communication can\nshed light on human language is still firmly rejected by some. For\nexample, Bickerton (2007: 512) asserts that \u201cnothing resembling\nhuman language could have developed from prior animal call\nsystems.\u201d \n\nBickerton fronts the following simple argument for his view:\n\nIf any adaptation is unique to a species, the selective pressure that\ndrove it must also be unique to that species; otherwise the adaptation\nwould have appeared elsewhere, at least in rudimentary form. (2007:\n514)\n\n\nThus, the mere fact that language is unique to humans is sufficient to\nrule out monkey and primate call systems as preadapations for\nlanguage. But, contra Bickerton, a neo-Darwinian like\nJackendoff (2002) appeals to the work of Dunbar (1998), Power (1998),\nWorden (1998) to provide a selectionist story which assumes that\ncooperation in hunting, defense (Pinker and Bloom 1990), and \u201c\n\u2018social grooming\u2019 or deception\u201d are selective forces\nthat operated on human ancestors to drive increases in expressive\npower that distinguishes non-human communication and human linguistic\ncapacities and systems. Bickerton (2014), however, combines aspects of\nEssentialism, Emergentism, and Externalism by taking equal parts of\nMinimalism, primatology, and cultural evolution into a more holistic\naccount. He specifically tailors a niche construction theory to\nexplain the emergence of displaced, discrete symbolization in a\nparticular kind of primate, namely human beings. He thus allows for\n(a) and (b) to figure in an explanation of (c). This is somewhat of a\ndeparture from his earlier positions.\n\nWithin the general Essentialist camp, language evolution has taken\ncenter stage since the inception of the Minimalist Program. An\nexplanation of the evolution of language now became one of the main\ntheoretical driving forces behind linguistic theory and explanation.\nAgain, the focus seems to have stayed largely on (c). Berwick and\nChomsky explicitly state:\n\n\nAt some time in the very recent past, apparently sometime before\n80,000 years ago, if we can judge from associated symbolic proxies,\nindividuals in a small group of hominids in East Africa underwent a\nminor biological change that provided the operation Merge-an operation\nthat takes human concepts as computational atoms and yields structured\nexpressions that, systematically interpreted by the conceptual system,\nprovide a rich language of thought. (2016: 87)\n\n\nSuch theories rely heavily on the possibility of the evolution of\nlanguage being explained in terms of saltation or random mutation.\nThis postulate has come under significant scrutiny (see Steedman\n2017). Saltation views, however, rely on one of the core assumptions\nmentioned in the quote above, i.e. that language evolved circa 100 000\nyears old. This central claim has recently been challenged by Everett\n(2017) who cites paleontological evidence from the alleged nautical\nabilities of Homo Erectus to dismantle this timeline. If\ntrue, this would mean that language evolved around two million years\nago and random mutation need not be the only viable explanation as\nmany in the Essentialist framework assume (see Progovac 2015 for a\nparticular gradualist account). \n\nWhile generative Essentialists debate among themselves about the\nplausibility of adaptive explanations for the emergence of essential\nfeatures of a modular language capacity, Emergentists are perhaps best\ncharacterized as seeking broad evolutionary explanations of the\nfeatures of languages (topic (c)) and communicative capacities (topics\n(b) and (c)) conceived in non-essentialist, non-modular ways. And as\ntheorists who are committed to exploring non-modular views of\nlinguistic capacities (topic (c)), the differences and similarities\nbetween (a) and (b) are potentially relevant to (c).\n\nPrimatologists like Cheney and Seyfarth, psychologists like Tomasello,\nanthropologists like Terrence Deacon, and linguists like Phillip\nLieberman share an interest in investigating the communicative,\nanatomical, and cognitive characteristics of non-human animals to\nidentify biological differences between humans, and monkeys and\nprimates. In the following paragraph we discuss Cheney and Seyfarth\n(2005) as an example, but we could easily have chosen any of a number\nof other theorists.\n\nCheney and Seyfarth (2005) emphasize that non-human primates have a\nsmall, stimulus specific repertoire of vocal productions that are not\n\u201centirely involuntary,\u201d and this contrasts with their\n\u201calmost openended ability to learn novel sound-meaning\npairs\u201d (p. 149). They also emphasize that vocalizations in\nmonkeys and apes are used to communicate information about the\nvocalizer, not to provide information intended to \u201crectify false\nbeliefs in others or instruct others\u201d (p. 150). Non-human\nprimate communication consists in the mainly involuntary broadcasting\nof the vocalizer\u2019s current affective state. Moreover, although\nCheney and Seyfarth recognize that the vervet monkey\u2019s\ncelebrated call system (Cheney and Seyfarth 1990) is\n\u201cfunctionally referential\u201d in context, their calls have no\nexplicit meaning since they lack \u201cany propositional\nstructure\u201d. From this they conclude:\n\nThe communication of non-human animals lacks three features that are\nabundantly present in the utterances of young children: a rudimentary\nability to attribute mental states different from their own to others,\nthe ability to generate new words, and lexical syntax. (2005: 151)\n\n\nBy \u2018lexical syntax\u2019 Cheney and Seyfarth mean a kind of\nsemantic compositionality of characteristic vocalizations. If a\nvocalization (call) were to have lexical syntax, the semantic\nsignificance of the whole would depend on the relation of the\nstructure of parts of the call to the structure of what they signify.\nThe absence of \u2018lexical syntax\u2019 in call systems suggests\nthat it is illegitimate to think of them as having anything like\nsemantic structure at all.\n\nDespite the rudimentary character of animal communication systems when\ncompared with human languages, Cheney and Seyfarth argue that monkeys\nand apes exhibit at least five characteristics that are\npre-adaptations for human communication:\n\ntheir vocalizations are representational;\nthey have competitive/cooperative relations in which alliances,\nfriendships, and rivalries that \u201ccreate selective pressures for\nthe kind of complex, abstract conceptual abilities that are likely to\nhave proceeded the earlier linguistic communication\u201d;\nbecause of (ii), their representations of social relations between\nindividuals and themselves are hierarchally structured;\ncertain monkeys, e.g. baboons, have open-ended, rule-governed\nsystems of social knowledge;\ntheir knowledge is propositional.\n\n\nIt is, of course, controversial to claim that monkeys have\nrule-governed propositional social knowledge systems as claimed in\n(iv) and (v). For instance, Tomasello\u2019s (2008)\n\u2018Cooperative Communication\u2019 approach makes a case for\nprimate intentional systems not based on their vocalizations but on\ntheir gestural systems. Therein he claims that \u201cgreat ape\ngestural communication shares with human linguistic communication\nfoundational aspects of its manner of functioning, namely, the\nintentional and flexible use of learned communicative signals\u201d\n(2008: 21).\n\nBut Emergentists, Externalists, and Essentialists could all, in\nprinciple, agree that there are both unique characteristics of human\ncommunicative capacities and characteristics of such capacities that\nare shared with non-humans. For example, by the age of one, human\ninfants can use direction of gaze and focus of attention to infer the\nreferent of a speaker\u2019s utterance (Baldwin and Moses 1994). By\ncontrast, this sort of social referencing capacity in monkeys and apes\nis rudimentary. This suggests that a major component of humans\u2019\ncapacity to infer a specific referent is lacking in non-humans.\n\nDisagreements between the approaches might be due to the perceived\nsignificance of non-human communicative capacities and their relation\nto uniquely human ones.\n5.2 Historical evolution\n\nWe mentioned earlier that both early 20th-century linguistics\nmonographs and contemporary introductory textbooks include discussions\nof historical linguistics, i.e., that branch that studies the history\nand prehistory of changes in particular languages, how they are\nrelated to each other, and how and why they change. Again, this topic\nis distinct from the emergence of language in hominoid species and\nconcerns mostly the linguistic changes that have occurred over a much\nshorter period within languages.\n\nThe last decade has seen two kinds of innovations related to studying\nchanges in particular languages. One, which we will call\n\u2018linguistic phylogeny\u2019, concerns the application of\nstochastic phylogenetic methods to investigate prehistoric population\nand language dispersion (Gray and Jordan 2000, Gray 2005, Atkinson and\nGray 2006, Gray et al. 2009). These methods answer questions about how\nmembers of a family of languages are related to each other and\ndispersed throughout a geographic area. The second, which we will call\nthe effects of transmission, examines how interpreted artificial\nlanguages (sets of signifier/signified pairs) change under a range of\ntransmission conditions (Kirby et al. 2008, Kirby 2001, Hurford 2000),\nthus providing evidence about how the process of transmission affects\nthe characteristics, especially the structure, of the transmitted\ninterpreted system.\n5.2.1 Linguistic phylogeny\n\nRussell Gray and his colleagues have taken powerful phylogenetic\nmethods that were developed by biologists to investigate molecular\nevolution, and applied them to linguistic data in order to answer\nquestions about the evolution of language families. For example, Gray\nand Jordan (2000) used a parsimony analysis of a large language data\nset to adjudicate between competing hypotheses about the speed of the\nspread of Austronesian languages through the Pacific. More recently,\nGreenhill et al. (2010) used a NeighbourNet analysis to evaluate the\nrelative rates of change in the typological and lexical features of\nAustronesian and Indo-European. These results bear on hypotheses about\nthe relative stability of language types over lexical features of\nthose languages, and how far back in time that stability extends. If\nthere were highly conserved typological and lexical features, then it\nmight be possible to identify relationships between languages that\ndate beyond the 8000 (plus or minus 2000) year limit that is imposed\nby lexical instability.\n5.2.2 Effects of transmission\n\nThe computational and laboratory experiments of Kirby and his\ncollaborators have shown that under certain conditions of iterated\nlearning, any given set of signifier/signified pairs in which the\nmapping is initially arbitrary will change to exhibit a very general\nkind of compositional structure. Iterated learning has been studied in\nboth computational and laboratory experiments by means of diffusion\nchains, i.e., sequences of learners. A primary characteristic of such\nsequences of transmission is that what is transmitted from learner to\nlearner will change in an iterated learning environment, in a way that\ndepends on the conditions of transmission.\n\nThe children\u2019s game called \u2018Telephone\u2019 in the USA\n(\u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019 in the UK), provides an example of\ndiffusion chains under which what is transmitted is not stable. In a\ndiffusion chain learning situation what a chain member has actually\nlearned from an earlier member of the chain is presented as the input\nto the next learner, and what that learner has actually learned\nprovides the input to the following learner. In cases where the\ninitial learning task is very simple: i.e., where what is transmitted\nis both simple, completely transmitted, and the transmission channel\nis not noisy, what is transmitted is stable over iterated\ntransmissions even in cases when the participants are young children\nand chimpanzees (Horner et al. 2006). That is, there is little change\nin what is transmitted over iterated transmissions. However, in cases\nwhere what is transmitted is only partially presented, very complex,\nor the channel is noisy, then there is a decrease in the fidelity of\nwhat is transmitted across iterations just like there is in the\nchildren\u2019s game of Telephone.\n\nWhat Kirby and colleagues show is that when the initial input to a\ndiffusion chain is a reasonably complex set of arbitrary\nsignal/signifier pairs, e.g. one in which 27 complex signals of 6\nletters are randomly assigned to 27 objects varying on dimensions of\ncolor, kind of motion, and shape, what is transmitted becomes more and\nmore compositional over iterated transmission. Here,\n\u2018compositional\u2019 is being used to refer to the high degree\nto which sub-strings of the signals come to be systematically paired\nwith specific phenomenal sub-features of what is signified. The\ntransmission conditions in these experiments were free of noise, and\nfor each iteration of the learning task only half of the possible 27\nsignifier/signified pairs were presented to participants. Under this\nkind of transmission bottleneck a high degree of sign/signified\nstructure emerged.\n\nA plausible interpretation of these results is that the developing\nstructure of the collection of signs is a consequence of the repeated\nforced inference by participants from 14 signs and signifieds in the\ntraining set to the entire set of 27 pairs. A moral could be that\niterated forced prediction of the sign/signified pairs in the entire\nset, on the basis of exposure to only about half of them, induced the\ndevelopment of a systematic, compositional structure over the course\nof transmission. It is reasonable to conjecture that this resulting\nstructure reflects effects of human memory, not a domain-specific\nlanguage module\u2014although further work would be required to rule\nout many other competing hypotheses.\n\nThus Kirby and his colleagues focus on something very different from\nthe prerequisites for language emergence. Linguistic nativists have\nbeen interested in how primates like us could have become capable of\nacquiring systems with the structural properties of natural languages.\nKirby and his colleagues (while not denying that human cognitive\nevolution is of interest) are studying how languages evolve to be\ncapable of being acquired by primates like us.\n5.2.3 Trends in the Philosophy of Language Evolution\n\nLastly, language evolution has amassed a great deal of\ninterdisciplinary work in recent times. This has allowed philosophers\nto directly contribute to this emerging field. The trends in the\nphilosophical work have only loosely followed the Externalist,\nEmergentist and Essentialist divisions we advocate here. Most\nphilosophical work has largely been focused on Emergentist conceptions\nwithin the evolution of linguistic meaning specifically.\n\nBar-On (2013) distinguishes between Gricean and Post-Gricean\napproaches to the evolution of language. The former requires an\nattribution of Gricean speaker meaning to our languageless ancestors\nwhich in turn seems to assume intentional actions govern by\nrationality (\u2018nonnatural meaning\u2019). This task is as\nfraught as explaining the evolution of language itself. She thus\nproposes the latter, specifically a Post-Gricean (Orrigi and Sperber\n2000) approach which takes expressive communication (found widely in\nnon-human animal species) as a basis for the emergence of linguistic\nmeaning between signalers and receivers. She states:\n\n\nExpressive communication, I will argue, exhibits features that\nforeshadow significant aspects of linguistic communication. In its\ndomain, we can identify legitimate natural precursors of meaningful\nlinguistic communication. (For present purposes, by \u2018legitimate\nnatural precursors\u2019, I mean behavioral interactions that at\nleast: a. can be found in the natural world; b. go beyond\nTomasello\u2019s mere \u2018communicative displays\u2019; c. do not\ndepend on crediting the relevant creatures with language-like\npropositional thought or post-Gricean communicative intentions, and;\nd. exhibit features that foreshadow important semantic and pragmatic\nfeatures of linguistic communication so in that sense are\nproto-semantic and proto-pragmatic.) (2013: 354)\n\n\nRecent work in Evolutionary Game Theory has also lent credence to the\nemergence of signaling systems involving non-intentional states.\nTaking Lewis (1969) as a spring-board, Skyrms (2010) investigates the\nstructure of signaling behavior beyond the existence of mutual\nconventions. His framework starts from the most basic non-trivial\ncases and gradually introduces complexity (such as deception and the\nintroduction of new signals etc.). Skyrms\u2019 account views\npropositional or semantic content as a special case of informational\ncontent thereby reintroducing information theory as a tool to\nphilosophers of language and linguistics interested in the emergence\nof linguistic communication and/or semantic meaning.\n",
