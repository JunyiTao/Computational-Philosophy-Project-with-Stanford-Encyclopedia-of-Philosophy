    "main_text": "Phenomenology of Life and the Concept of Transcendental Affectivity || The Critique of Intentionality and of Ontological Monism\n2.1 The Critique of Intentionality and of Ontological Monism\n\nIf Henry\u2019s critique of intentionality is construed through a\ncritique of Husserlian phenomenology, it nevertheless comports a much\nwider perspective that includes a \u201cdeconstruction\u201d of the\nhistory of philosophy in general, insofar as the latter relies on a\nlimited concept of appearing or phenomenality. Every philosophy, Henry\nargues, relies on phenomenological presuppositions and, therefore,\n\u201ca critique of phenomenality necessarily concerns philosophy in\ngeneral\u201d (PNI 105). Phenomenality as such, however, is the\nobject of phenomenology. As Husserl notes in, for instance, his\nG\u00f6ttingen Lectures of 1905, phenomenology is concerned with\nhow objects are given (Gegenst\u00e4nde im\nWie, Husserl [GW]: 117). The mode of givenness, i.e.,\nappearing itself, is therefore what phenomenology must\ninvestigate. For Henry, however, this line of thought must be taken\none step further to include the fact that appearing itself must\nappear. Since things are devoid of the ability to become phenomena by\nthemselves, Henry argues, that which makes them appear has itself to\nappear. Otherwise, nothing would appear at all (PNI 107\u20138). As a\nresult, phenomenology cannot be reduced to a method that would make us\nsee how things appear to us.  Instead it finds its proper object with\nthe question \u201cHow does appearing appear?\u201d According to\nHenry\u2019s reading of the phenomenological tradition, however, we\nare faced with a very peculiar situation where intentionality is\nconsidered the sole mode of appearing.\n\nSince intentionality is, as Sartre emphasized, always consciousness of\nsomething other than consciousness itself, appearing becomes\n\u201cek-static\u201d by its very essence, i.e., it points to\nsomething exterior to itself. This leads in turn to replace the\nquestion of appearing with that of the appearing of entities\nor beings and, finally, centers the focus of phenomenology on\nbeings (\u00e9tants) insofar as they\nappear. This tendency, an \u201contological monism\u201d that\naccording to Henry has pervaded most of the history of philosophy,\nleads to a reduction of human subjectivity to the sole function of\nbeing directed outward, and thus to equate it with the exteriority or\n\u201ctranscendence of the world\u201d (EM 89). Henry does not deny\nthat decisive results were achieved through the perspective of\nintentionality, notably in Husserl\u2019s investigations into\nnoetic-noematic correlation (I 91). His question however is that of\nintentionality itself, i.e., the transcendental question\nregarding the conditions that make intentionality possible. If\nintentionality gives access to objects, how do we access\nintentionality itself and is such an access also intentional? In other\nwords, is the way through which intentionality is given homogenous to\nthe way objects are given? The problem with a philosophical horizon\nconstituted by ontological monism is that it presupposes \u201cthe\nunderstanding of the essence of manifestation as representation\u201d\nand, thus, makes \u201cinaccessible to philosophical thought the\nvery idea of a reception which would not be essentially the reception\nof an exterior content\u201d (EM 237).\n\nFor Henry, the answer to the question of homogeneity is clearly\nnegative. If intentionality enables us \u201cto see\u201d, in the\nsense of sight pertaining to consciousness in general, then we must\nbear in mind that the act of seeing is not itself seen\u2014on the\ncontrary, it escapes sight. As a result, an intentional act is not\nprimarily given in an intentional way. Or, in the language of the\nEssence of Manifestation, we must admit \u201cthe\nimpossibility for transcendence to lay its own foundation and thus to\nconstitute the essence of the foundation\u201d (EM 210). \n\nMoreover, if we take seriously the claim that appearing itself must\nappear, then in order to avoid an infinite regress such appearing\nwould have to be self-appearing\n(auto-appara\u00eetre). Intentionality, however, since it\npoints toward and reveals something other than itself, cannot fulfill\nthis task of self-revelation. Thus, Henry concludes that the\nfundamental mode of appearing, namely the self-appearing of appearing,\ncannot have an intentional structure. It must be non-intentional and,\nsince intentionality is tied to visibility in the general sense of\nperception (or representation), invisible. In other words,\nthe origin and the essence of manifestation\u2014the\n\u201carchi-revelation\u201d\n(Archi-R\u00e9v\u00e9lation) as Henry will put it later\nin Genealogy of Psychoanalysis for instance\u2014is a\nself-revelation or, in the terminology forged as early as the\nEssence of Manifestation, an auto-affection that\nrefers to nothing but itself.\n\nIn Henry, \u201clife\u201d (vie) has therefore no\nbiological meaning, but an exclusively phenomenological one, which\nmeans that it refers to this fundamental mode of appearing that is, as\nself-appearing, radically distinct from the ek-static nature of\nintentionality. It is not the opening to an other, but enclosed in\nitself, undergoing itself in self-experience (\u00e9preuve de\nsoi that Henry distinguishes from conscience de soi,\nself-awareness), which is precisely for Henry the condition of\npossibility of any experience of an other or\nhetero-affection. As Henry intends to illustrate in\nBarbarism through the somewhat ironic example of a biology\nstudent, none of the forms of intentional directedness\u2014including\nthe most elaborate forms of scientific knowledge\u2014would be\npossible if they weren\u2019t revealed as such to a living subject\nthat is characterized by auto-affection or, better yet, that\nis auto-affection. Henry also uses the term\n\u201ctranscendental affectivity\u201d to characterize this\nself-appearing proper to his phenomenological concept of life: it is\ntranscendental in the sense that it is the condition of\npossibility of every possible phenomenon, and it is\naffectivity because the self-experience that characterizes\nthe living (vivant) is a form of primal suffering\n(souffrir originaire) or pathos.\n\n\u201cPathos\u201d refers to the fact that, because of its\nself-enclosed nature, such an experience cannot cease to adhere to\nitself. But, like the flip side of a coin, this self-adherence is also\nthe condition for the greatest joy, namely the joy of living. Joy and\nsuffering are thus fundamental tonalities that both express the fact\nthat life cannot escape from itself, that it is irremediably tied to\nitself. This explains for instance why the concrete experience of\nsuffering can become unbearable. Henry\u2019s analysis of appearing\nis, as one can see, connected to the question of the subject\nof appearing: phenomena only exist for a subject, and subjectivity is\nprecisely conceived of as life, i.e., as the essence and origin of\nevery possible phenomenon. At the same time, and because of its\nauto-affective nature, subjectivity is marked by the fundamental\ntonalities of joy and suffering.\n\nHenry\u2019s approach to phenomenology could be characterized further\nas \u201chyletic\u201d, in reference to Husserl\u2019s concept of\nhyl\u00e8 (primal impressions, raw sensuous-data as matter\nfor consciousness), with one important difference however. Whereas for\nHusserl hyl\u00e8 is raw matter destined to be shaped into\nan intentional form (morph\u00e8) and only becomes a\nphenomenon through this shaping, Henry\u2019s \u201cmaterial\nphenomenology\u201d reverses the relation between\nhyl\u00e8 and morph\u00e8 by 1) giving to\nhyl\u00e8 its own form of (self-)appearing as affectivity,\nindependently from intentionality; and 2) grounding intentionality in\naffectivity, the latter becoming the transcendental condition of the\nformer. As Henry writes in Material Phenomenology (1990):\n\n\nThis self-givenness [\u2026] is structurally different from\n\u201crelating-to\u201d. It is not in itself a\n\u201crelating-to\u201d but insurmountably excludes it from itself.\nIt is not outside of itself but in itself, not transcendence but\nradical immanence. And it is only on the basis of this radical\nimmanence that something like transcendence is possible. Seeing is\nactualized only as a nonseeing [\u2026]. This nonseeing, this\nunseen, this invisible, is not the unconscious. It is not the negation\nof phenomenality but its first phenomenalization. It is not a\npresupposition but rather our life in its non-ek-static but yet\nundeniable pathos. (MP 81)\n\n\nConsequently, Henry understands his phenomenology as being a radical\ndeparture from monism insofar as it advocates the \u201cduplicity of\nappearing\u201d. If a non-intentional self-appearing is necessary in\norder for intentionality to be possible, than there are indeed two\nmodes of appearing: an intentional appearing that operates by means of\ndifference and that constitutes the intentional object as\ntranscendent; and a non-intentional or \u201caffective\u201d\nappearing (appara\u00eetre path\u00e9tique, which\nwould\u2014in opposition to \u201cek-static\nappearing\u201d\u2014literally translate as \u201cpathetic\nappearing\u201d, an expression that remains controversial among Henry\ntranslators) that is given in pure immanence prior to any\nsubject-object division. \n",
